[34:06] second
[34:09] dear Lord Senor I find it such an honor
[34:14] of
[34:16] feedback among your people
[34:19] in Las Cruces once again in Las Cruces
[34:23] that we could worship you
[34:27] and Lord I have nothing new to say
[34:31] but I just want to put the Brethren and
[34:35] remember
[34:37] of what you have already said
[34:41] in the written word
[34:44] and through the mouth of your prophets
[34:58] in the name of the Lord Jesus
[35:03] we believe in him we trust
[35:08] amen
[35:12] God bless you you could be seated
[35:17] I bring greetings
[35:21] from the church at home
[35:25] a faith of the Apostles
[35:28] my pastor Brother David Moore
[35:32] David Morris who wanted me to extend
[35:35] greetings to you all
[35:40] and I told the brothers today
[35:45] that I would tell you all tonight
[35:50] don't ever think that you're stuck down
[35:53] here in the corner
[35:57] of New Mexico
[35:59] by yourself solos because
[36:04] the Bride of Jesus Christ
[36:10] the body of Christ
[36:12] is
[36:14] we are not divided
[36:17] but when you hurt
[36:22] but when you glory
[36:26] brother Caleb was telling us here about
[36:31] all of these ministers
[36:33] that had just been ordained in Africa
[36:37] when you glory
[36:39] Gloria we Glory off
[36:43] because we are not building our kingdom
[36:47] and you are not building your kings
[36:54] are helping
[36:56] to build the kingdom
[36:59] of the Lord Jesus Christ
[37:03] anything beyond that
[37:06] is
[37:09] and I believe
[37:11] that we should let
[37:21] for the glory of the king but I like
[37:23] Gloria Del Rey amen amen
[37:31] I had wanted to come last year
[37:36] and I came down with the flu
[37:42] and could not make the trip
[37:47] and uh we are on our way out to Harmony
[37:50] in the desert is
[37:54] but I called brother Caleb and told him
[37:57] I wanted to come by and see you all
[38:00] again
[38:03] see when I first met brother Caleb and
[38:06] brother Tom when the Primera best
[38:09] we were all together at a meeting up in
[38:13] Northern Illinois
[38:15] in Illinois
[38:18] and usually in that meeting
[38:22] they only give a minister just a few
[38:25] minutes but
[38:31] gospel preachers
[38:36] we can't say it in just a couple of
[38:38] minutes
[38:41] so they took a little bit more time
[38:45] praise God the sons of God
[38:51] by the spirit of God
[38:55] and when I I after the meeting
[38:59] we did not have a lot of time to
[39:01] Fellowship
[39:04] would you shake hands
[39:06] hey I enjoyed
[39:09] I enjoyed what you had to say okay okay
[39:15] but I purposed in my heart
[39:18] I want to spend some more time around
[39:21] those Spirits
[39:23] you know I love it
[39:27] when you can get around people
[39:31] but you've never met them before
[39:34] and in just a few minutes
[39:38] it's like we've known each other all of
[39:41] our Lives
[39:43] I believe that it's because
[39:47] that when the sons of God shouted
[39:55] we knew each other
[39:58] and what we see in this life is
[40:02] just a reflection
[40:05] of where we have come from
[40:09] and we have the same testimony
[40:13] as the Lord Jesus had
[40:16] that we have come from God
[40:19] and we're going back
[40:23] amen amen God Bless you
[40:27] that's why we can have fellowships
[40:31] it's not around the Creed
[40:35] it's not around some kind of a
[40:37] fellowship card that we would carry in
[40:40] our pockets
[40:43] but it's because that we have been
[40:46] washed in the blood
[40:49] baptized in the holy spirit
[40:57] amen into amen Body of Christ
[41:03] God bless you
[41:07] again I say it's an honor then and a
[41:11] privilege to be here with you
[41:14] but if you turn with me in the
[41:17] scriptures
[41:21] I don't know if I should read in English
[41:23] also yes
[41:28] if you turn with me in second
[41:31] Corinthians 5 Second Chronicles
[41:40] and I'd like to start it verse 10. yes
[41:53] there was nothing in the ark
[41:57] save the two tables
[42:01] which Moses put therein at aura
[42:05] when the Lord made a commandment
[42:10] with the children a covenant with the
[42:13] children of Israel
[42:25] when they came out of Egypt
[42:29] and it came to pass
[42:33] when the priests were come out of the
[42:36] Holy place
[42:39] for all the priests that were present
[42:47] and did not then wait by course
[42:52] also the Levites
[42:55] which were the singers
[42:58] all of them of Asia
[43:02] of amen amen of Jonathan
[43:06] with their sons and their brothers
[43:10] being a raid in White
[43:14] linenofino having symbols and sultry is
[43:21] stood at the East End of the altar all
[43:25] oriente and with them 120 priests found
[43:29] him with
[43:30] trumpet
[43:32] and it came to pass
[43:37] as the trumpeters and singers were as
[43:40] one when
[43:43] to make one sound
[43:47] to be heard and praising and thanking
[43:50] the lord
[43:52] and when they lifted up their voice
[43:57] with the trumpets and symbols and
[44:00] instruments
[44:03] of music
[44:06] and praise the Lord
[44:09] saying for he is good
[44:16] that then the house was filled with a
[44:20] cloud
[44:21] even the house of the Lord
[44:25] so that the priest
[44:28] could not stand to ministers
[44:33] by reason of the clouds
[44:36] for the glory of the Lord
[44:39] build the house of the Lord
[44:43] I want you to get this picture
[44:47] of course we're speaking here of
[44:51] Solomon's temples
[44:54] it had been years and being built and
[44:58] anyone
[44:59] and we know the story of how that David
[45:03] had it on his heart
[45:06] and he went to Nathan the prophet if we
[45:09] if
[45:11] Nathan told him said do all this in your
[45:14] heart
[45:16] because David was under conviction
[45:20] he said it's not right
[45:23] that I live in a house of Cedars
[45:29] but the Ark of God is
[45:33] dwelling in a tent
[45:37] but then the spirit of the Lord spoke to
[45:40] His prophets
[45:43] and that Prophet came back to David
[45:47] and he said you're not the man to do it
[45:49] because
[45:51] there's blood on your hands
[45:54] you're a man of war
[45:56] but God's Gonna raise the son to you
[46:00] and he'll do it
[46:03] let me stop here for just a second
[46:06] moment I hear people say brother farmer
[46:09] I can't preach
[46:12] God hasn't called me to
[46:15] preacher but if you're Desiring
[46:19] to do something for God
[46:22] there's always something for you to do
[46:26] David could not build the Tabernacles
[46:30] but he said I'll go out and get gold
[46:34] you're
[46:43] El Cedro
[46:46] and he laid them up in store
[46:50] and David dedicated
[46:54] the cups that would be used in the
[46:57] service of the Lord
[47:06] and then in the building of the temple
[47:10] you know when I came by the church
[47:13] earlier today
[47:20] a brother had a saw on the back of his
[47:23] truck
[47:27] but in the building of that Temple
[47:31] the scripture tells us there was not the
[47:34] sound
[47:37] striking Stones
[47:44] right construction job and they said
[47:49] and yet it was done so reverently
[47:54] as we could imagine the brothers getting
[47:57] together
[47:59] they wouldn't even talk inside the
[48:02] temple
[48:03] but they would talk on the outside
[48:23] they built the entire temple
[48:27] with such a holy hush and
[48:30] riverencia
[48:32] because it was dedicated to the Lord
[48:38] so when it come time to dedicate it
[48:42] the construction was all done yesterday
[48:46] now they're going to dedicated
[48:50] and the glory of this Temple La Gloria
[48:54] Este it was the most glorious thing
[48:59] that had ever taken place in Israel
[49:03] they never had a structure like
[49:09] and all of the priests
[49:12] they had their dedication service ready
[49:18] they had all their notes ready
[49:21] and the singers had all of their songs
[49:25] ready
[49:26] and the singers the scripture said had
[49:30] dedicated theirself
[49:33] priest had dedicated
[49:36] they were dressed in white linens
[49:40] what type of the Bride of Jesus
[49:47] oh they made sure that their prayer
[49:50] claws
[49:53] evenly over their heads
[49:56] no doubt they were showing their self to
[49:59] each other
[50:01] because they wanted to make sure
[50:03] everything was right
[50:28] they had went by and dedicated
[50:32] Los instrumentos
[50:35] that's nice
[50:37] because they wanted everything perfecto
[50:42] amen because they never had a service
[50:49] and they thought that they had
[50:51] everything perfectly ready
[50:57] and they was ready to come out
[51:01] and preach their dedication sir
[51:05] dedication but when the power of God
[51:08] came down
[51:11] and that Smoky prison yes
[51:14] you know what I'm talking about it just
[51:18] looks like a mistake when
[51:23] and that cloud comes down
[51:26] oh let me tell you something we don't
[51:30] just have a picture of the clouds
[51:39] I could tell you of a service and a
[51:42] house
[51:44] bill Kentucky and are you in Kentucky
[51:47] when my daughter got the Holy Ghost
[51:50] Santo
[51:55] we had family Alder
[51:58] family and we knelt down in the living
[52:01] room and prayed in La Sala
[52:04] but when we got done praying my daughter
[52:08] wasn't done
[52:12] and mama said honey
[52:15] are you still wanting something
[52:19] and she said yeah I want the Holy Ghost
[52:25] and our family Alder had just started
[52:28] this is
[52:33] that little girl ain't never been the
[52:36] same since
[52:40] amen amen and we had the lights off in
[52:44] the living room
[52:46] but there was a light on in the kitchen
[52:51] towards the kitchen
[52:53] they looked like there was smoke all
[52:56] three
[52:59] oh that's the presence of God
[53:03] and it changes everything
[53:06] I want you to know tonight
[53:09] while the presence of the Lord is in the
[53:12] building
[53:17] be content to leave here without no
[53:20] security
[53:22] we've got wonderful ministers
[53:26] thank God foreign
[53:48] [Applause]
[54:01] hey amen
[54:06] the scripture
[54:09] if we turn to
[54:12] the second chronicles
[54:18] chapter 3.
[54:22] and we're starting at verse 5. I want
[54:26] you to listen at how the Apostle Paul
[54:30] um
[54:34] not that we are sufficient of ourselves
[54:39] versus
[54:47] now if
[54:49] you could say this
[54:52] and the prophet of God brother Branham
[54:56] could say that same thing
[54:59] but I am nothing
[55:02] but he's here
[55:08] then where does that leave room
[55:12] for anybody
[55:15] just start thinking themselves as being
[55:18] something
[55:20] let me tell you something the only way
[55:23] that I can help you tonight
[55:27] as if I become small
[55:31] so that he can become greater
[55:35] the less that you see a forest Farm
[55:39] the forest farmer so that the more you
[55:43] can see of the Lord Jesus
[55:46] Jesus amen amen let's read on
[55:52] but our sufficiency
[55:56] the only thing that makes us capable
[56:01] is God is
[56:06] you know I've heard good preachers
[56:09] and sometimes I've heard them preach the
[56:12] best messages
[56:25] hello hola you know I heard one time of
[56:28] a a man that was a music critic is
[56:33] that he went to a concert and well uh
[56:38] and he said that he wrote the shortest
[56:43] appraisal
[56:48] of that concert
[56:50] that he had ever written
[56:54] it said Immaculate
[56:58] but no conception but on my conception
[57:01] I've heard some sermons about like that
[57:04] yes
[57:06] they were letter perfect perfect
[57:09] preacher stood just perfect
[57:12] but there was no life
[57:16] there couldn't be a life because there
[57:19] had been a death before that the life
[57:22] could come from
[57:32] that the people aren't looking at a big
[57:34] name preacher okay
[57:38] but we're looking at the only great one
[57:43] amongstros that's when God can come on
[57:46] this thing is
[57:48] make himself manifest yes
[57:52] amen amen
[57:55] who also
[58:06] [Music]
[58:13] because remember the spirit
[58:17] makes the world live
[58:20] the devil is not scared
[58:23] of your Bible
[58:26] the devil is not scared Mr Church age
[58:31] book or your seal books
[58:33] they are scared of your Cod books
[58:43] and the life of a human Hallelujah
[58:52] then he gets down and he tremble Anton
[58:54] says
[58:56] y'all don't mind me taking off a coat do
[58:59] you
[59:02] then Anton says the enemy gets upset
[59:08] I believe that we have been called
[59:12] nervous Devil's nervous but I said Los
[59:15] Los de monos
[59:18] to make thick Devils sick I said lost
[59:26] these Minister Brothers can tell you
[59:30] we can come to the platform
[59:34] not feeling well
[59:37] um
[59:38] but by the time services
[59:44] we're feeling real good
[59:47] because the power of God comes on the
[59:50] same
[59:53] and that sick devil just doesn't have
[59:56] dominion over us anymore
[59:59] that is not hell for a few preachers
[1:00:04] that is not for just a few priests
[1:00:09] that is for each and everyone
[1:00:12] that we claim every promise of God
[1:00:17] hold on to it
[1:00:20] amen amen
[1:00:24] this word
[1:00:25] has not been delivered
[1:00:29] it's all the few individuals
[1:00:33] but this word has come is that the veil
[1:00:38] was taken off
[1:00:40] at one time they
[1:00:44] Lord help
[1:00:49] there was such a glory
[1:00:52] Gloria on the face of Moses
[1:00:56] that they could not look on him
[1:01:00] that would blind them
[1:01:03] but instead they had to take a veil
[1:01:07] and they'd put that Veil over Moses's
[1:01:11] face
[1:01:13] you couldn't see him plainly
[1:01:17] it was shielded
[1:01:20] and it was the same way
[1:01:23] with the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:01:26] that he was fail from us
[1:01:29] but in this day
[1:01:32] there's never been a day like this
[1:01:37] Angel begins
[1:01:39] yesterday the mystery of God
[1:01:45] and the veil was taken
[1:01:49] I can tell you I've got something in my
[1:01:52] hand
[1:01:54] but it's bail from
[1:01:57] you don't know what it is
[1:02:00] but if I take the veil off of it
[1:02:04] everyone in here can see brother
[1:02:06] Farmer's got his pocket knife finished
[1:02:10] why do you know that
[1:02:13] because it's been unveiled to you
[1:02:16] it's no longer got the veil of my hand
[1:02:19] over it
[1:02:23] that's what has happened in this day
[1:02:31] off of the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:02:37] let's go on and read
[1:02:42] on down
[1:02:47] but if the ministration of death SI
[1:02:51] administered
[1:02:53] Moses Moises
[1:02:56] had Administration
[1:02:59] he had a Ministry in the young mini
[1:03:02] studio that it was chiseled in stone
[1:03:05] oh it was Permanente
[1:03:09] but yet the glory that was there but I
[1:03:13] went like Gloria Glory that's shown on
[1:03:16] Moses's face
[1:03:23] there was going to be an end to that
[1:03:27] but if the administration of death
[1:03:35] was glorious so that the children of
[1:03:39] Israel could not stand fastly
[1:03:43] the whole the face of Moses
[1:03:47] for the glory of his countenance
[1:03:51] which Glory was to be done away with
[1:03:56] how shall not
[1:03:59] the ministration of the spirits
[1:04:05] be rather glorious Gloria for if the
[1:04:10] ministration
[1:04:11] ministerio that's another word for
[1:04:14] Ministry in English of condemnation
[1:04:19] be glory welcome Gloria then how much
[1:04:23] more munchamas
[1:04:26] does the ministration
[1:04:28] administerio of righteousness
[1:04:32] exceeding glory and Gloria
[1:04:37] for even that
[1:04:39] which was made glorious
[1:04:42] had no glory in this Respect
[1:04:46] by reason of the glory
[1:04:49] Gloria that Excel yes
[1:04:53] I don't know if y'all have been out for
[1:04:56] the last two or three nights
[1:05:00] we've had a full moon
[1:05:04] and man you could just stick your head
[1:05:06] out the door put that point out
[1:05:08] and say it is so bright outside you see
[1:05:12] this is
[1:05:13] that you could almost drive without your
[1:05:16] headlights
[1:05:18] since
[1:05:19] but when the sun came up
[1:05:23] you couldn't even see the light of the
[1:05:26] Moon
[1:05:28] because the glory of the Sun
[1:05:32] so much more glorious rather
[1:05:36] gloriosa then what the light of the moon
[1:05:39] was De La Luna that's the reason why is
[1:05:43] that when people have been caught in
[1:05:47] denominationalism
[1:05:52] let me stop right here I'm not just
[1:05:55] talking about baptist and methodists
[1:06:06] that had a one-man denomination
[1:06:13] your pastor try and tell them something
[1:06:17] no no
[1:06:19] won't take
[1:06:21] Corrections we know what kind of a
[1:06:24] character that that is according to the
[1:06:25] scriptures
[1:06:30] one man denomination
[1:06:33] brother don't you think you need to
[1:06:36] consider what was preached last week
[1:06:41] oh that's her brother
[1:06:44] I wasn't for me
[1:06:49] one man's denomination
[1:06:51] I'm right
[1:06:54] pasture ain't right
[1:07:01] God didn't say
[1:07:04] I'll give you one man denomination
[1:07:18] amen amen
[1:07:20] I don't know how I got on that
[1:07:24] but there you go
[1:07:27] amen amen
[1:07:33] the Lord knows what he's doing
[1:07:42] if
[1:07:45] if the ministry
[1:07:48] a dedicating
[1:07:51] Solomon's temples
[1:07:54] which was made by hand
[1:07:59] was that glorious
[1:08:02] that the house was filled with smoke
[1:08:08] before the preacher ever said
[1:08:16] oh come on come on
[1:08:18] you say brother farmer you're talking
[1:08:20] about a different day yesterday
[1:08:23] and I guess I'm just living in a
[1:08:26] different day

[1:08:34] do I have to remind you that the prophet
[1:08:37] of God

[1:08:51] I said what is that is
[1:08:54] that brother Branham they hear that
[1:08:57] often here
[1:08:59] and the problem that God said it sounded
[1:09:02] like angels singing
[1:09:06] hello or under what nobody there

[1:09:39] even if you watch the film
[1:09:43] of the prophet of God
[1:09:48] where he just started talking
[1:09:51] and finally he said you know I'm waiting
[1:09:54] on something
[1:09:57] I'm waiting on him
[1:09:59] because until he cameo
[1:10:04] brother Branham couldn't do anything

[1:15:47] ammunitions
[1:15:57] but you can take
[1:15:59] boring
[1:16:01] back when I was a boy
[1:16:05] I went out hunting out in Colorado
[1:16:10] and there was a an Old Gentleman came
[1:16:13] out on the rifle ring
[1:16:18] he had a rifle that looked like it had
[1:16:21] been used for a boat
[1:16:22] uh
[1:16:25] uh para mobile
[1:16:31] and he's setting up a targeted 500 yards
[1:16:38] the Legos
[1:16:40] Anna somebody got to laughing at his gun
[1:16:44] yeah
[1:16:47] and one of the boys that I was with got
[1:16:50] to laughing at it you know that Los
[1:16:52] Muchachos
[1:16:53] he thought that 700 Remington 300 Mag
[1:16:57] that he had was just to catch me out
[1:17:05] but I seen something sitting on top of
[1:17:08] that rifle
[1:17:11] that it was a German Zeiss rifles
[1:17:18] and you don't put a piece of glass like
[1:17:21] that on a BB gun nope
[1:17:27] and I said I'd be careful
[1:17:31] how I talked about that man's rifle
[1:17:34] hombre
[1:17:37] and a little bit later he called Down
[1:17:39] the Line
[1:17:42] does anybody have a range fine
[1:17:48] somebody hollered back yeah
[1:17:51] and he said how far is that White Rock
[1:17:54] up there
[1:17:57] and they called out 800 yards
[1:18:02] and he pulled a little piece of paper
[1:18:05] out of his pocket with a pencil
[1:18:09] I thought oh boy
[1:18:12] he sat down with that rifle and dusted a
[1:18:16] little old rock up there on the side of
[1:18:18] them
[1:18:21] because he knew what he had
[1:18:26] oh let me tell you something church I
[1:18:29] know what we've got
[1:18:32] whom I have believed you're saying
[1:18:37] help take the strong hand of faith
[1:18:43] when he laid that rifle across the stand
[1:18:46] back
[1:18:48] he wasn't shaken and quivered
[1:18:52] you couldn't see one movement out of it
[1:18:56] but when he pulled the
[1:19:00] triggered
[1:19:02] amen amen and if we sinosotros we'll
[1:19:07] just forget about put more emotion into
[1:19:10] it
[1:19:12] God do what he foreign
[1:19:39] vessels dedicated vasos dedicados to the
[1:19:43] work of the Lord
[1:19:45] why are we here
[1:19:50] nobody's paying us to come tonight
[1:19:54] but we've come for one reason
[1:19:57] we want to get a little bit closer to
[1:20:00] God
[1:20:02] we want to have fellowships
[1:20:06] oh yes we have Fellowship one with
[1:20:08] another company
[1:20:13] it's worth fellowshipping God in our
[1:20:16] brother and our sisters
[1:20:20] and God in his word
[1:20:25] see if it was just to come see sort of
[1:20:27] what I uh and to tell you of a couple
[1:20:31] quotes
[1:20:32] oh they're strength I've worsen at you
[1:20:36] but when God quickens that word
[1:20:42] that it causes us to go out differently
[1:20:48] are you here
[1:20:50] we don't walk the same way that we use
[1:20:56] that's the power of the Holy Ghost
[1:20:59] we don't think the way that we used to
[1:21:02] think
[1:21:04] why what is it the quickening power of
[1:21:07] the Holy ghosts
[1:21:15] don't worry that we can't even think
[1:21:21] those preachers when they came out
[1:21:25] their knees just went to wobbling they
[1:21:29] got under that power and they couldn't
[1:21:31] say nuts
[1:21:34] I love it when a man comes out
[1:21:37] and he don't even know what he's going
[1:21:40] to say
[1:21:42] but just the vessel that gets yielded to
[1:21:45] the Holy Spirit
[1:21:47] he's talking over the dinner table today
[1:21:54] that you can have a man come in from
[1:21:58] four or five states away
[1:22:01] go through conversations that you and
[1:22:05] your pastor has had
[1:22:07] it goes through people's minds oh
[1:22:11] brother Caleb told him
[1:22:15] it happens at home too
[1:22:18] I've seen Brother David throw up his
[1:22:21] hands in the air
[1:22:24] giant instead of word
[1:22:29] amen amen
[1:22:31] what is it yes it's that same Smokey
[1:22:35] press this
[1:22:39] that just takes over a human being
[1:22:45] what is it that makes us behave the way
[1:22:48] that we do you know
[1:22:52] would it be okay just to remind you of
[1:22:55] something else
[1:22:59] one time there was a cyst
[1:23:02] that was going to get her little baby
[1:23:05] prayed for Eva uh and she went in
[1:23:09] looking for a seat
[1:23:12] and there was no seats
[1:23:15] but there was a mama
[1:23:18] that had compassion
[1:23:21] and seen this mama had a prayer card in
[1:23:25] her hands
[1:23:27] she said honey why don't you take my
[1:23:30] seat
[1:23:32] and I'll just find another state
[1:23:37] and she said I see you've got a prayer
[1:23:40] card
[1:23:42] but would it be okay if I just prayed
[1:23:45] for your baby
[1:23:52] and the mama laid hands on the baby
[1:23:59] and that night
[1:24:01] brother Brian I'm called that lady's
[1:24:04] number
[1:24:08] and she got it when she came up on the
[1:24:11] platform
[1:24:15] the Lord showed him
[1:24:19] said you want prayer for this baby
[1:24:22] but there's a woman setting up in the
[1:24:25] balcony
[1:24:27] that the Lord laid it on her heart to
[1:24:30] give you her seat
[1:24:33] could she pray for you
[1:24:37] and when she did God's already healed it
[1:24:40] just go your way
[1:24:43] oh it's not just for preachers it's for
[1:24:47] each and every one of them
[1:24:52] dinosaurs
[1:24:58] people tells me all the time said Oh
[1:25:01] Brother Farms
[1:25:03] those things are just coincidence
[1:25:06] and I believe that the Bride of Jesus
[1:25:09] Christ
[1:25:11] lives the most coincidence
[1:25:20] [Applause]
[1:25:26] I challenge you pray
[1:25:30] usted that God would put somebody
[1:25:35] in your life
[1:25:37] that you could be a witness too
[1:25:41] and see if God won't do it
[1:25:47] amen amen
[1:25:50] amen amen
[1:25:55] of course I may not be preaching as hard
[1:25:57] as what you think I should be he says
[1:26:04] in February of last year
[1:26:07] I survived what they called the Widow
[1:26:10] make her heart attack yes
[1:26:16] my heart got down to 40 beats the minute
[1:26:19] in the back of the ambulance because
[1:26:35] people can say whatever that they want
[1:26:37] to play
[1:26:40] but when you have stared death in the
[1:26:44] face
[1:26:49] it is
[1:26:58] that Stinger was pulled out on cows
[1:27:12] so I said if the Lord didn't take me off
[1:27:15] the scene
[1:27:18] I have not fulfilled no I completed God
[1:27:22] wants me to do on this Earth
[1:27:29] until I do
[1:27:33] see
[1:27:35] I've been a contractor most of my life
[1:27:39] you know we did on a paint job
[1:27:45] we'd write down what I'm gonna do and
[1:27:48] what the price was going to be
[1:27:52] following me
[1:27:53] nobody paid me for just going on the job
[1:28:03] I had to get the job done
[1:28:06] so I've kindly got a contractor's
[1:28:09] mentality
[1:28:12] even now
[1:28:15] let's get the job done and go to the
[1:28:17] house
[1:28:23] I'm ready to go yesterday
[1:28:26] [Applause]
[1:28:28] you know when they wheeled me into the
[1:28:30] heart cath
[1:28:32] laboratory
[1:28:34] they didn't take me to the emergency
[1:28:36] room
[1:28:38] they give me an EKG
[1:28:43] in my living room
[1:28:45] I had a little box on the ambulance
[1:28:50] the pyramid took a picture of it with
[1:28:53] his phone
[1:28:56] send it to the hospital
[1:28:59] when the ambulance rolled up at the
[1:29:02] hospital

[1:29:08] is Mr farmer I said yeah I said just
[1:29:13] follow up Laboratory
[1:29:22] shot a little bit of dying uh
[1:29:27] so what we're about to do
[1:29:30] could cause stroke could even cause
[1:29:33] death
[1:29:37] do we have your permission to proceed
[1:29:41] I said let's do it over here
[1:29:46] they shot the dying
[1:29:50] they've seen where the problem was
[1:29:56] I felt a little Thug pants
[1:30:01] and I guess I grunted
[1:30:06] the doctor said you felt that is
[1:30:11] he he said we got it
[1:30:15] pull the blood clot out
[1:30:22] I said

[1:30:50] that was three millimeters
[1:30:53] about 28 millimeter long foreign
[1:31:02] um
[1:31:06] they give me some medicine
[1:31:08] I was awake all through that
[1:31:13] but then when they got done I guess I
[1:31:16] relaxed enough
[1:31:18] but I was asking for about 15 minutes
[1:31:24] I don't respond real well to pets
[1:31:41] and I didn't even have my eyes open here
[1:31:45] and I said ma'am are you from the
[1:31:48] Philippines
[1:31:53] I said I thought I I recognized the
[1:31:56] accent
[1:31:57] uh and I started talking to her about
[1:32:01] when I went on a mission trip into the
[1:32:03] Philippines
[1:32:07] and I see you about three hours later
[1:32:12] and my son took a picture
[1:32:15] of me laying propped up in the bed with
[1:32:18] my finger stuck up in the air the York
[1:32:23] reaching to a nurse
[1:32:26] and Clifford sent that picture to a
[1:32:29] bunch of the brothers and foreign
[1:32:57] [Applause]

[1:34:04] morning
[1:34:07] when she opened the door
[1:34:10] I sleep kind of like
[1:34:14] so I woke up
[1:34:17] and she said they told me you had a
[1:34:21] heart attack the day before yesterday
[1:34:27] she said you don't look like you had a
[1:34:30] heart attack
[1:34:33] I said ma'am that's because I served the
[1:34:36] most high God yes
[1:34:39] he takes care of the other people

[1:35:24] stories foreign
[1:36:08] brother Branham said
[1:36:12] y'all ain't gonna get mad at me are you

[1:36:18] young kids hugging around and kissing on

[1:36:59] that tells me is that I've got the
[1:37:03] authority to tell people what I told
[1:37:05] that nurse
[1:37:09] if there's a desire in your heart
[1:37:13] to be where you once was with the Lord
[1:37:18] there's a place in the arms of the Lord
[1:37:33] she started crying
[1:37:38] I said we sing a song at home
[1:37:42] that says With Arms Wide Open
[1:37:46] he'll welcome you
[1:37:48] it is
[1:37:55] my wife had already seen that I've went
[1:37:58] into preaching mode
[1:38:04] so she went to get me a cup of coffee
[1:38:09] just as I was saying that
[1:38:13] and this little black nurse was in there
[1:38:16] crying
[1:38:21] do you want us to pray with you
[1:38:25] and she said yes I do yeah
[1:38:29] we joined Hands Across that hospital bed
[1:38:35] young lady back into the presence of the
[1:38:38] amen
[1:38:45] when she left to go she said I hate to
[1:38:50] live I've got other people I've got to
[1:38:52] take care of yesterday
[1:38:56] when she left the room
[1:38:59] I looked up at the clock
[1:39:02] it was
[1:39:05] 555
[1:39:08] I asked my wife I said what greater
[1:39:11] testimony
[1:39:20] from the time even on the wall
[1:39:24] I said in what a way to start the day
[1:39:30] if a heart patience

[1:39:43] amen amen
[1:39:46] she come by just before she went off her
[1:39:52] and she said I'm gonna pray yeah that
[1:39:56] they don't let you go home
[1:39:59] so that we can start these conversations
[1:40:03] foreign
[1:40:37] I said you know yesterday was kind of
[1:40:40] like your shop
[1:40:45] that brought you back to life
[1:40:49] I said but you know the doctor told me
[1:40:53] that they didn't want a blood clot to
[1:40:57] form inmates
[1:40:58] foreign
[1:41:10] just as soon as you remember
[1:41:13] you take it right then
[1:41:16] and then you get back on the skin
[1:41:22] I said because that doctor
[1:41:26] was looking long term
[1:41:31] for my help for me
[1:41:34] salute I said now we gotta look long
[1:41:43] I said if we're gonna keep you alive
[1:41:48] I said you've got to get back into the
[1:41:51] word of God
[1:41:55] I showed her an app that I had on my
[1:41:58] phone I said they've got a Verse of the
[1:42:01] Day applications
[1:42:04] like just reading that verse
[1:42:07] I want to read the whole chapter
[1:42:10] so it ain't taking nothing out of
[1:42:13] Congress
[1:42:15] so my wife showed her how to load that
[1:42:18] is
[1:42:20] but now you listen to me
[1:42:23] I said because the animal makes you
[1:42:26] Elena Migos
[1:42:30] you'll wake up late
[1:42:33] or there'll be a traffic jam on
[1:42:38] um
[1:42:41] that you forget
[1:42:43] but just as soon as you remember
[1:42:49] you get back on schedule regression your
[1:42:54] medicine right there don't mess with
[1:42:56] momento
[1:42:59] oh I think too many times
[1:43:02] we forgot to have a family altar in our
[1:43:05] homes
[1:43:15] oh it's good for what else is
[1:43:21] the next day she had a prayer request
[1:43:24] a petition
[1:43:26] see she wasn't even a nurse that works
[1:43:29] in that hospital
[1:43:32] a traveling nurse on contract 809 809
[1:43:40] and her time was almost run out yeah
[1:43:50] you know it seems like that I'd learned
[1:43:53] to follow the voice of God
[1:43:57] so that I wouldn't have to have a heart
[1:44:00] attack
[1:44:01] but the Lord would just stay forced I
[1:44:04] want you to walk the floors of that
[1:44:06] hospital as a nurse I want you to talk
[1:44:08] to you
[1:44:13] God help me
[1:44:15] but be more receptive to heal
[1:44:20] that every step that I take
[1:44:25] is where he wants me to go isn't that
[1:44:28] yes
[1:44:36] you know I don't want the Lord to have
[1:44:38] to push me you know
[1:44:44] but let me be found
[1:44:50] entregado
[1:44:51] she said would you all pray
[1:44:55] that I could get a job
[1:44:58] as a a an OB and delivery but uh uh are

[1:46:44] testify before
[1:46:54] I always use that verse of Hebrews 13.
[1:47:01] just because that brother Branham had it
[1:47:08] although that might be plenty good
[1:47:11] enough wreath
[1:47:13] because I have seen God manifested like
[1:47:18] that
[1:47:20] Jesus Christ yesterday
[1:47:27] today
[1:47:29] and foreign
[1:47:36] before I ever started preaching
[1:47:41] one day I was out in the yard
[1:47:45] we had a
[1:47:47] little place that we were living back up
[1:47:50] a lane in the woods
[1:47:55] and a a kind Old Gentleman I guess
[1:47:58] probably 75 maybe 80 years old
[1:48:04] came up there and I I rolled out from
[1:48:07] under the pickup I was changing the oil
[1:48:13] and he said sir could I talk to you for
[1:48:16] a minute
[1:48:20] and I said yesterday
[1:48:23] uh he said did you know
[1:48:27] there's only one name that God chose to
[1:48:31] be known by
[1:48:36] I said you must be talking about Jehovah
[1:48:41] oh he went to silent real big he said
[1:48:45] yes
[1:48:49] Anna
[1:48:51] he said so what Kingdom Hall do you
[1:48:56] attend yes
[1:49:01] I said I'm sorry I've never heard of a
[1:49:04] Kingdom Hall in my Bible is
[1:49:11] and uh
[1:49:15] he said are you a Jehovah's Witness yes
[1:49:19] I said yes I am
[1:49:22] I witnessed for him every chance that
[1:49:24] again
[1:49:26] I wasn't a preacher yet
[1:49:29] I didn't know you had to be a preacher
[1:49:32] you know
[1:49:37] I only know one qualification
[1:49:41] for telling somebody how your candle got
[1:49:45] lit this is
[1:49:52] only thing that's needed is
[1:49:56] and I said sorry uh you made the
[1:49:59] statement
[1:50:03] God only had one name that he chose to
[1:50:06] be known by yes
[1:50:09] I I said well we would agree that uh God
[1:50:14] is the only one that's Eternal it is
[1:50:19] and he said yeah
[1:50:22] of course I couldn't go into details
[1:50:24] with him right then
[1:50:27] about how that I was eternal lost
[1:50:31] because I am in Christ
[1:50:35] but uh I said well I've got a question
[1:50:38] then
[1:50:40] I said
[1:50:43] who was Melchizedek
[1:50:47] because the scripture said he was was
[1:50:49] out beginning of days
[1:50:53] or ending thereof always

[1:51:03] he said I'll have to go home and study
[1:51:06] um
[1:51:09] sure Iglesia I don't have any name
[1:51:15] but run away
