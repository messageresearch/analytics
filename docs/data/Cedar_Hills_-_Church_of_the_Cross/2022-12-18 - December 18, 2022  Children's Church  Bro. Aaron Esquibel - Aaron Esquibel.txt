good afternoon Stan I'm reporting live from Israel in the Jordan River thank you um and uh I got my fellow journalists around here did he drop here he is oh he said am I happy to be here with you at this time I'd like to interview but we now have the gospels can you tell how your experience wasn't has been in Israel well been amazing I am standing here in the water where Jesus himself was baptized by by um John the Baptist there you go and I we also went to some other amazing places like Nazareth and Bethlehem and there is this willing wall that where you put your hands on it and you pray and when you're done praying you have to take five steps back and then turn around you can't just turn around so yeah yeah and I'll turn it back to my brother my son's journalists well Stanley can I have to say it there myself so back to you I'm putting life in Israel all right so I am here gonna interview brother our brother Joseph Joseph tell us how was your experience my experience in Israel has been absolutely remarkable we went to here let me say we went to Bethlehem where Jesus was born we also went to Nazareth where he was raised and that was absolutely amazing we were we had the privilege to put our hands on a whaling wall and um we actually prayed to Jesus there which was remarkable it was breathtaking and I can ask for a better experience yes that's it what's up bad and I what's going on wow we would like to know how was your experience here in Israel it was tremendous we had such a great time meeting the people we went to meet and some brothers and sisters here locally went to their church it was just a blessing to fellowship with them uh you heard Brother Joseph talking about the different places that we've gone we also went to mount Temptation today uh before coming here and then you see the Jordan River like they've been telling y'all there's so much other things that we're going to be seeing it's great it's wonderful it's a blessing and we hope that all of you guys enjoy all the pictures and videos I'd like to interview one more question and thank you brother Marcus yes Brother Carlos hello brother how are you good you good doing well sir doing well good can you can you tell the church how how your experience this hell was yours um I sure can my experience with that and I was uh nothing short of amazing it's it's what I would probably call a once in a lifetime opportunity um it's it's uh it's an opportunity to come to the Holy Land and and be here but not just visit a place like this but also have the opportunity to accompany my pastor and a lot of tremendous Brethren from our church I'm here and and it's been a remarkable opportunity it's been truly humbling um it has been something that is eye-opening and that I would recommend for anybody please try to make this trip it's it gives you a completely different perspective on the Bible you see the Bible through a totally different set of eyes and you understand the Bible in a way that that you cannot possibly grasp unless you come to this place so brother and I I think that's that's that's all I've got to say but it's been amazing and thank you for the opportunity thank you well that's it son thank you to see him and Reporting live from Israel where Jesus Christ comes first thank you thank you let me just say I better ask for forgiveness I did not know the Rio Grande was that impactful it looked like they were behind the Alamo let's see are we missing something did we cover it all I think we did why don't we read that scripture again Ephesians 4 25. you know there's so many bad things going on so much fake news we want to always focus on the good things and always remember that Jesus Christ is the winner and he'll always tell you the truth so if we want the truth we got to tell the truth we got to be the truth here why don't you read it off the board here well for reporting putting away lying speak every man truth with his neighbor before we all members one of another now let me ask the question who is it talking about in each other anybody hey don't do that it is talking about us now that we have heard the truth we can now say
