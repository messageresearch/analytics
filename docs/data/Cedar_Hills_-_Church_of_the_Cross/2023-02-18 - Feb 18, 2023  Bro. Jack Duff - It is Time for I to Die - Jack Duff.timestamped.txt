[10:02] amen God bless you
[10:04] it's good to see all your beautiful
[10:05] faces
[10:07] I like to say that because it catches
[10:08] everyone off guard
[10:10] this poem is called drink and thirst no
[10:13] more
[10:14] and I've been waiting to give it since
[10:15] last year so
[10:16] I hope you enjoy it
[10:19] it is said we are like Christ not the
[10:23] Christ exactly it is said in perfect
[10:25] place we are believers body
[10:29] we do the works of he who hath paved the
[10:31] way before us to sum the days of
[10:34] Miracles have surely come and gone
[10:37] though some are surely wrong here this
[10:40] offered scripture if we believe the word
[10:42] of God we know that this is true he that
[10:45] believeth on me the works that I do
[10:47] shall he do also and Greater Works than
[10:50] these shall he do
[10:52] we say we believe on God while doing not
[10:55] the acts the Lord Our God let this
[10:57] unfold this book ever compact we say we
[11:01] faith enough for all but healeth not the
[11:04] herd salvation Believers Rend deeming
[11:07] all absurd any Act of Christ is here an
[11:11] action we should take all in action he
[11:14] made absent an act we should forsake
[11:17] we look to water that is poured by
[11:19] comely worldly men giving from a drying
[11:22] well refreshing but with end there our
[11:25] Christ sits right beside and offers life
[11:28] eternal the non-perverted Everlasting
[11:30] life-giving fraternal
[11:33] he that drinketh from that well shall
[11:35] spring upon the people
[11:37] everlasting life of which we have filled
[11:40] Within water that to them we give
[11:43] knowing where we begin if this be not
[11:46] the acts of God within our time what
[11:49] more does one need to realize or see the
[11:51] last enzyme we are fountain in this land
[11:54] placed to share this life not the life
[11:57] that we once lived Instead The Life of
[12:00] Christ in position we must do the works
[12:03] that God requires we must be in perfect
[12:06] place at any given moment
[12:08] glorify his mighty name not our minute

[1:02:56] I'm one of them
[1:03:01] praise the Lord
[1:03:05] amen Joshua chapter 8.
[1:03:13] we will start reading at verse 16.
[1:03:24] the Bible says
[1:03:27] and all the people that were in I were
[1:03:30] called together to pursue after them
[1:03:32] and they pursued after Joshua and were
[1:03:35] drawn away from the city
[1:03:45] and there was not a man left in I or
[1:03:48] Bethel that went not out after Israel
[1:03:51] and they left the city open and pursued
[1:03:54] after Israel
[1:03:55] Hombres Israel
[1:04:06] and the Lord said unto Joshua stretch
[1:04:09] out the spear that is in thy hand toward
[1:04:12] I
[1:04:13] the eye will give it into thine hand and
[1:04:17] Joshua stretched out the spear that he
[1:04:19] had in his hand toward the City Anthem
[1:04:21] says
[1:04:37] praise the Lord amen let's just have a
[1:04:39] word of prayer
[1:04:42] uh Lord Jesus
[1:04:44] we're grateful for the opportunity
[1:04:48] to be able to read the word of God
[1:04:51] but we know it takes the Holy Spirit
[1:04:55] to make the word live
[1:04:58] for our day
[1:05:01] so God speak to us through your words
[1:05:04] take control of everything
[1:05:07] take control of every action
[1:05:10] may you be glorified can you be
[1:05:14] magnified there's magnification
[1:05:16] in this place father we give the service
[1:05:20] to you
[1:05:21] in Jesus Christ
[1:05:24] amen amen amen God bless you can be
[1:05:27] seated
[1:05:28] praise the Lord
[1:05:30] amen so uh the theme of the meeting is
[1:05:35] the
[1:05:40] amen and I wanted to use for a title
[1:05:44] it is
[1:05:49] praise the name of the Lord It's time
[1:05:52] for eye to die yes
[1:05:54] I've preached this sermon back home
[1:05:58] and uh when I preached it back home I
[1:06:01] had a different title
[1:06:04] and as we were fellowshipping today at
[1:06:07] breakfast
[1:06:13] and he was saying uh he was preaching
[1:06:16] some sermons on worship
[1:06:21] and in one of those sermons he made a
[1:06:24] commentary it says uh often times in
[1:06:28] families
[1:06:30] uh maybe the parents uh have something
[1:06:33] against the children
[1:06:35] maybe the us parents have something
[1:06:38] against each other
[1:06:41] and oftentimes we fail to realize
[1:06:45] that is a spirit behind that yeah
[1:06:49] that is causing the people to be
[1:06:51] separated
[1:06:53] and then we begin to attack the person
[1:06:57] rather than attacking the real problems
[1:07:01] and brother Caleb said we have to find
[1:07:04] the cause
[1:07:06] and when he said find the cause
[1:07:09] I said that was my sermon title when I
[1:07:13] preached it at home he said
[1:07:15] I knew I was in the right channel
[1:07:22] to fit with the things
[1:07:28] and if you have not come to a death
[1:07:31] I pray that this would be the day
[1:07:35] that you can establish foreign
[1:07:51] [Applause]
[1:08:40] and I want to say this to you uh this
[1:08:42] evening
[1:08:47] may be acceptable in society
[1:08:51] and sometimes it's acceptable to you
[1:08:54] but it's still not acceptable to God
[1:08:59] hallelujah hallelujah we don't want to
[1:09:01] walk
[1:09:02] in the permissive will of God
[1:09:06] we want a 12 daily
[1:09:26] amen amen when you come to a stop sign
[1:09:30] you have to yield
[1:09:33] amen and understand that yielding it's
[1:09:37] for your protection
[1:09:47] it is
[1:09:51] amen and I want to I want to just inject
[1:09:54] this
[1:09:55] the Bible tells us lay aside foreign
[1:10:03] [Music]
[1:10:44] oh no
[1:10:46] I asked my church
[1:10:50] to uh
[1:10:54] pause
[1:10:59] and ask a question yes
[1:11:04] Lord show me something
[1:11:06] that I can lay aside this year
[1:11:12] and I want to pause here today
[1:11:15] just to give you a chance
[1:11:17] to say that same prayer to God
[1:11:21] lord show me something
[1:11:24] that I can lay aside
[1:11:28] something that would allow you and I
[1:11:30] I'll go
[1:11:32] draw closer together
[1:11:36] I'm pausing yes
[1:11:39] for you to think about it but like you
[1:11:41] said Lord what can I lay aside
[1:11:47] closer together
[1:11:50] as you're yielding
[1:11:53] you died
[1:12:06] John 12 SE
[1:12:14] there were some bricks and I won't I
[1:12:16] won't read for the sake of time oh
[1:12:19] I I usually keep a little timer
[1:12:23] so I Don't Preach too long
[1:12:26] but I forgot to set the time
[1:12:29] so that was free everything I just said
[1:12:40] but in John 12.
[1:12:42] express some Greeks that were coming to
[1:12:45] worship at the feast
[1:12:48] they encountered Phillips
[1:12:51] and uh they they made a statement to
[1:12:54] Philip Felipe
[1:12:56] we would see Jesus
[1:12:59] hallelujah hallelujah Philip went to
[1:13:01] Andrew
[1:13:03] and both of them together went to Jesus
[1:13:07] and these men that travel very far
[1:13:11] I heard about Jesus but they finally got
[1:13:15] to the spot where they could see them
[1:13:17] for themselves
[1:13:22] we don't want to see anybody else but we
[1:13:26] want to see Jesus and when they got to
[1:13:29] Jesus
[1:13:30] who made the statement
[1:13:32] praise God in verse 23. he says the
[1:13:36] hours
[1:13:38] that the son of man personal
[1:14:09] [Music]
[1:14:32] the Bible goes on to say he that loving
[1:14:35] his life shall lose it and he that hate
[1:14:38] this life in this world shall keep it
[1:14:42] unto eternal life eternal
[1:14:45] brother Brandon told a story
[1:14:52] he actually called him an old dorky
[1:14:57] and uh that's I'm just giving you the
[1:15:00] quote
[1:15:00] please don't go around and say words
[1:15:06] but it's just a quote I'm just giving
[1:15:08] you the quotes
[1:15:13] this man had an experience with God
[1:15:18] recognized that he had an experience
[1:15:23] there was something different about this
[1:15:25] man is
[1:15:27] realized the difference
[1:15:33] and it says you know I gotta have that
[1:15:35] same Holy Ghost experience
[1:15:40] if God could change
[1:15:43] then I know he can change me
[1:15:46] and it's in the beginning
[1:15:51] it says I want that same Holy Ghost
[1:15:54] and we are a design
[1:15:57] we are dessert
[1:16:01] that we see in the book of animals
[1:16:10] yes
[1:16:14] [Applause]
[1:16:18] [Music]
[1:16:30] he says he says
[1:16:50] you can't get it here
[1:16:56] the boss said okay if we can't come to
[1:16:58] the Corn Crib
[1:17:01] let's go up to the Halos
[1:17:08] he said maybe I can get it up there he
[1:17:11] says
[1:17:12] Moe's walked into the Halo
[1:17:17] you can't give it up here
[1:17:20] it says
[1:17:22] we went to the Corn Crib
[1:17:30] take me where I can give the Holy Ghost
[1:17:33] he said follow me this is a single man
[1:17:36] and he rolled up his pants
[1:17:46] you can get it right here
[1:17:50] what was he trying to tell about yeah
[1:17:53] you've got to be willingness
[1:18:13] [Applause]
[1:18:18] brother random says this in the message
[1:18:23] it says anything's got to die
[1:18:26] before you can get life and
[1:18:30] life only comes by death
[1:18:37] you take a grain in a corn and you plant
[1:18:39] it
[1:18:42] except that grain of corn will lay there
[1:18:45] and Minos que is
[1:18:56] out of that rotten mess
[1:19:04] all the human-made psychology beat out
[1:19:07] of them
[1:19:09] by the Holy Spirit
[1:19:14] to their rotten
[1:19:16] to their own ideas
[1:19:18] then they will receive the Holy Ghost
[1:19:22] when you can get all the Creeds and
[1:19:25] stuff
[1:19:29] brought it out of you yes
[1:19:36] he said that's all for bad it gets fail
[1:19:39] but that's the only way I know to say it
[1:19:42] you understand it till it rocks
[1:19:50] to a place
[1:19:52] amen where they're dead
[1:20:00] as I thought about that quote
[1:20:02] amen I thought of the in the scripture
[1:20:06] let's be through that Naaman was not
[1:20:09] willing
[1:20:11] to his thoughts
[1:20:14] he wanted healing but in order to
[1:20:18] receive healing
[1:20:20] he had to be willing to die
[1:20:23] he heard the testimony of a living God
[1:20:27] for the servant girl
[1:20:30] she spoke of a prophet in Israel
[1:20:40] oftentimes we have people
[1:20:42] a man that's not willing
[1:20:47] to die to their denominational thoughts
[1:20:52] listen to the thoughts of a problem
[1:20:55] if you're gonna understand the words
[1:20:58] you have to look through

[1:31:15] of his brother's son and all their
[1:31:16] substance that they had gathered

[1:32:17] my ideas
[1:32:18] and he followed God by faith and notice
[1:32:22] where it ends up in verse
[1:32:25] and he removed from dense unto a
[1:32:27] mountain on the east of Beth Bethel

[1:32:35] west east
[1:32:59] I want us to follow something in the
[1:33:02] scripture

[1:33:05] make one comment about Abraham leaving
[1:33:07] amen haran and then going to this place
[1:33:09] that God called him
[1:33:14] brother Brandon made a statement he says
[1:33:18] we're fine
[1:33:20] you cannot be blessed
[1:33:23] and cannot do nothing he says and God
[1:33:27] cannot do nothing for you
[1:33:29] till you completely obey him
[1:33:33] I want to say that again
[1:33:36] you cannot be blessed
[1:33:47] Abraham did not receive His blessings
[1:33:50] until he actually disconnected from life
[1:33:56] you know I want to tell you somebody's
[1:33:57] got some friends in our life
[1:34:00] that are hindering us from receiving our
[1:34:03] blessings

[1:34:10] means more trust in our relationship
[1:34:12] with God
[1:34:13] [Music]
[1:34:14] there are a lot of things that come into
[1:34:17] our lives

[1:34:25] it is
[1:34:32] get it I'm not
[1:34:36] we look at Abraham
[1:34:39] brother Brandon made a statement out of
[1:34:41] the message Abraham and his seat after
[1:34:43] him
[1:34:46] he says separate yourself from your
[1:34:48] Kindred
[1:34:50] from all your Associates
[1:34:53] come out of the pool room
[1:34:58] come away from the things of the world
[1:35:02] God calls for total separation
[1:35:06] Abraham
[1:35:07] because that's what he called Abraham
[1:35:11] they are things of the world that we
[1:35:14] have to Die Young
[1:35:18] lay aside every sin and every week
[1:35:19] that's always
[1:35:24] I want us to just kind of follow
[1:35:26] something here in Scripture
[1:35:30] we're reading from The Book of Joshua
[1:35:35] now there's a couple things that we need
[1:35:37] to understand
[1:35:41] first of all there was uh the children
[1:35:44] of Israel walking through the Wilderness
[1:35:46] for 40 years
[1:35:49] and God began to bring them into the
[1:35:52] promised land after 40 years
[1:35:55] and the very first battle that they
[1:35:58] would have in the promise place
[1:36:01] would be the battle in Jericho
[1:36:04] hallelujah hallelujah and I love the way
[1:36:07] God does things
[1:36:09] when God brings you to various battles
[1:36:12] he often gives you different strategies
[1:36:16] to overcoming that battle
[1:36:19] as they face Jericho
[1:36:22] amen God gave them a strategy
[1:36:25] and in this strategy he says walk around
[1:36:29] the walls of Jericho
[1:36:33] go one time around Milwaukee
[1:36:39] seven times foreign
[1:37:16] [Music]
[1:37:35] [Music]
[1:37:41] tell the people don't say a word
[1:37:43] but when you beat them
[1:37:47] see what happens then
[1:37:50] on the seventh time
[1:37:52] Joshua told the people
[1:37:57] and the people let out a great job
[1:38:00] that the world came down
[1:38:04] and it was a mighty move
[1:38:08] everybody saw the supernatural
[1:38:12] wow they were in the mystery
[1:38:16] there was one man I was not moved by the
[1:38:20] superman
[1:38:23] was moved by Babylonian government
[1:38:29] the thing that impressed him okay

[1:39:09] foreign
[1:39:18] [Music]
[1:39:50] [Applause]

[1:40:42] Babylonians I got a question
[1:40:47] what banquet e what is it okay vento
[1:40:52] that Aiken could go to
[1:40:55] and where the Babylonians
[1:41:00] he was an Israelite era is Right
[1:41:04] could he have come out with the
[1:41:07] Babylonian government
[1:41:09] and say everybody look at me
[1:41:16] he had something in his tent then he is
[1:41:19] that he couldn't even wear and he said
[1:41:22] yes

[1:42:29] about these things
[1:42:33] and I want you to I want you to get it
[1:42:35] foreign
[1:43:03] here's a statement out of the message
[1:43:05] adoption part 2.
[1:43:08] brother random said Remember the only
[1:43:12] way that Israel ever lost a man
[1:43:15] is
[1:43:16] When sin got in the campus
[1:43:21] that's the only way we could ever lose a
[1:43:23] victory is
[1:43:26] for Santa is
[1:43:29] something wrong somewhere
[1:43:32] when Aiken stole that way
[1:43:36] and that Babylonian government
[1:43:39] sin was in the camps
[1:43:42] and the battle went wrong
[1:43:44] I want to just inject one thing here
[1:43:47] I'll try to read the scripture for you a
[1:43:50] little bit later
[1:43:51] when they went to Jericho they weren't
[1:43:54] supposed to take anything
[1:43:57] what that represented
[1:44:00] was that was the the first battle
[1:44:03] and all the spoil was to go to God
[1:44:11] it was the first battle
[1:44:19] hallelujah hallelujah it's time for us
[1:44:23] because the same way
[1:44:45] brother random says you give me this
[1:44:48] spotless church tonight
[1:44:53] perfectly in the promise of God
[1:44:55] with the holy ghost walking in the
[1:44:59] spirit
[1:45:00] challenge any disease
[1:45:03] [Music]
[1:45:05] or anything that there is
[1:45:08] every Joe Louis there is in the country
[1:45:11] with all of its infidelity and all of
[1:45:15] the unbelievers
[1:45:17] to bring in his sickness or Affliction
[1:45:21] In This Storm
[1:45:27] God gave the promise
[1:45:29] only sin of unbelief can keep it away
[1:45:35] it goes on in this quote
[1:45:38] yes there's where the church is failing
[1:45:41] today on that walk
[1:45:54] [Music]
[1:46:26] [Music]
[1:46:42] without even getting Maria
[1:46:50] [Applause]
[1:47:26] foreign
[1:47:53] Miracle with the walls coming down
[1:47:57] the first battle was Jericho
[1:48:03] but the Second Battle
[1:48:06] so I well I
[1:48:09] yo
[1:48:16] and they fail
[1:48:17] when they were trying to conquero
[1:48:28] brother Brandon said the greatest enemy
[1:48:34] it's William Brown It's William Branham
[1:48:37] so can I tell you your husband
[1:48:40] sues
[1:48:41] your wife is
[1:48:44] your children yeah
[1:48:56] man
[1:49:00] true
[1:49:04] after they went to fight I this place
[1:49:09] and the uh the soldiers told Joshua we
[1:49:13] don't really
[1:49:16] overcome this with no problems
[1:49:20] and they went up there is
[1:49:46] [Music]
[1:49:56] [Music]
[1:50:03] they begin to fast
[1:50:05] [Music]
[1:50:07] and then they begin to bring people one
[1:50:09] by one
[1:50:12] what happened
[1:50:19] bacon again tell us what happened you
[1:50:21] know
[1:50:28] remember when the wall fell down
[1:50:37] I saw a little witch
[1:50:40] and I saw some garments
[1:50:42] they weren't selling that in Israel
[1:50:50] You Realize by you taking that again
[1:50:56] where are these things
[1:50:58] buried in my tent is
[1:51:01] all these belongings
[1:51:07] [Music]
[1:51:10] if he would have been willing to die to
[1:51:12] himself
[1:51:15] he would not have been killed by
[1:51:17] somebody
[1:51:36] this is why it's so important is
[1:51:48] after he made the confession
[1:51:51] he was killed now I want to just show
[1:51:54] you something in scripture
[1:51:56] go to Joshua eight and verse Uno
[1:52:10] Bible says the Lord said unto Joshua
[1:52:16] yes see after they got rid of it now
[1:52:19] they can go back into battle hey yes
[1:52:25] take all the people who are with me
[1:52:32] see I have given into the hands
[1:52:50] hallelujah hallelujah don't be afraid to
[1:52:53] rise
[1:52:54] [Music]
[1:52:59] look at verse two verses
[1:53:09] our distance
[1:53:13] forget this statement only the spoil
[1:53:17] thereof loses
[1:53:24] for a pray unto yourself
[1:53:28] notice this because if Aiken would have
[1:53:31] waited
[1:53:35] he would have had to spoil for free
[1:53:42] he didn't have to steal the time
[1:53:49] [Music]
[1:53:52] speaking to many acres
[1:53:55] the blessings of God
[1:54:05] [Applause]
[1:54:09] now God gives a different strategies
[1:54:13] when they marched around Jericho
[1:54:16] it was walk around the wall seven uh six
[1:54:20] days
[1:54:22] one time on six days
[1:54:24] but on the seventh
[1:54:26] seven times but now in this battle
[1:54:30] against
[1:54:33] we're not marching around walls
[1:54:37] lady and Ambush
[1:54:41] for the city behind it
[1:54:46] God uses a different strategy
[1:54:49] and and I won't take time to read it but
[1:54:51] you know
[1:54:53] when you get home tonight
[1:54:56] this this new strategy is
[1:54:59] Joshua gets to gather the Army
[1:55:02] and they begin to move at night
[1:55:07] foreign
[1:55:08] [Music]
[1:55:25] [Music]
[1:55:33] [Music]
[1:56:05] blessed be the name of the Lord
[1:56:08] he says I want to encourage them get up
[1:56:12] and move at night
[1:56:14] get the Army together
[1:56:21] they said they're camps and they did it
[1:56:25] at night
[1:56:28] starts to begin to give instructions
[1:56:33] I'm gonna take a few men with me
[1:56:36] the others
[1:56:49] praise God Amen so Joshua they were
[1:56:54] waiting in the sunrise
[1:57:36] [Music]
[1:57:46] [Applause]
[1:57:47] and yeah
[1:57:49] [Applause]
[1:57:53] when he turned the spear on eyes
[1:57:57] the soldiers that were laying in Waiting
[1:58:03] ran into the city
[1:58:05] they burned down the city
[1:58:08] and when the king of our terms
[1:58:13] [Music]
[1:58:19] sometimes it looks like
[1:58:21] the devil has you surroundings
[1:58:31] [Applause]
[1:58:39] [Applause]
[1:58:51] turn the word on yourself
[1:58:55] oftentimes we spend so much time much of
[1:58:57] this is
[1:58:59] trying to get
[1:59:01] a moat
[1:59:04] out of somebody else's eyes
[1:59:13] we don't see the big two by four I don't
[1:59:16] know
[1:59:20] it's time for eyes
[1:59:23] to die
[1:59:31] I'll read one more quote
[1:59:37] this is out of the message Jehovah
[1:59:39] jirehide
[1:59:42] program says when God Saves a man it is
[1:59:49] now at the bottom it's got everything
[1:59:52] the name of Jesus Jesus wrote on it at
[1:59:55] the bottom of the checkbook
[1:59:58] whatever you're asking my name
[2:00:04] Abraham's C believes that
[2:00:07] just fill out the check
[2:00:10] and send it in the deposit has been made
[2:00:15] it's in the bank
[2:00:18] how did it come through
[2:00:20] not through your righteousness
[2:00:23] but through the righteousness of the
[2:00:25] righteous
[2:00:27] he was the one put the deposit in there
[2:00:31] the deposit is in the bank
[2:00:36] then don't be afraid to write out
[2:00:40] the bank will pay it off
[2:01:06] and the funds will return to you
[2:01:10] just as soon as she passes through the
[2:01:12] clearance
[2:01:14] that's right it's corrective down in
[2:01:17] your heart you truly believe
[2:01:19] that's the promise of God and you've
[2:01:22] accepted it is
[2:02:03] you haven't lost your Covenant

[2:07:11] developing
[2:07:14] the devil wants to give you an instant
