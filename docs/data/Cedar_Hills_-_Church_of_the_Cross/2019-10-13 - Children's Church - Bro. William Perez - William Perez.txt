have a special and I'm personally excited for this one we're gonna ask that the Sunday school children think that they come up and I'm and I'm assuming that they are gonna be rehearse not rehearsing but performing the verse that they know by memory so if all the children could come up and you all may be seated as they come up this is the Lord's Prayer Matthew 6:9 2:13 our Father which art in heaven hallowed be thy name thy kingdom come thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven give us this day our daily bread and forgive us our debts as we forgive our debtors and lead us not into

them another one this evening amen so you got to excuse me tonight I had few then trills for lunch so I might start hiccupping I had a nice big carne asada burrito I usually don't have anything large before I speak but you know I got really really hungry how many have been really really hungry hey man brother Jim we've been really really hungry huh bro yeah so I'm talking about amen how many are ready to maybe see something a little bit different tonight I want to show you something that really caught my attention well when I first saw it so how many know or how many have been through something or encountered something that you seemed that was impossible brother Jonah has come here my friend can you tell us what what come on me to the top can you tell everyone what happened that that that seemed impossible you don't know it was just crazy huh all right he said it was crazy so all right thank you brother Jonah well he seemed that there's many things that we find in our lives sometimes especially school or like sister like man this test is impossible right tease the sister says yes so we're going to read a scripture and then we're going to say a prayer and then I'll get you up here when everybody says down okay buddy all right let's turn into how many brought their Bibles today oh all right it seems like pretty much all of the the children brought their Bibles all right all right let's turn into the book of Saint Luke chapter 18 verse 27 can somebody be brave enough and read this scripture for me my man he said the things which are impossible with men with men are possible with God all right Thank You bud amen I mean the Lord has blessings to the reading of the word and you may be seated so I like that scripture it says with men or with us as children even as adults we sometimes find things that are impossible brother Avram right there raised up his hand right before we did the scripture I think he might have something to share right no okay yes come on up let's tell us whatever you think the test at school oh my gosh that's what I'm talking about he said the test at school was so easy what we got we got time for one more the PARCC test that I had to take was impossible did you make it through all right she made it through so tonight I want to show you something that's impossible everybody's eyes guys what is it how many know what this is what is it sister right here a paper all right everybody understand this is a paper right I needed a couple volunteers tonight neither maybe with two ladies someone have you and this one right here Natalie come on over so what I want you to do hope it's all right with their parents is that okay it's nothing dangerous okay what I want you to do is either one of you I want you to fit yourself into this paper inside of I want you to go through this paper I want you to fit your body inside of this paper why not so it so if this paper was a circle you could fit yourself inside of it okay if it was not just so so what are you saying right now is that this is that what I said is it impossible okay so do you think now her being her size Natalie can she fit herself inside of this paper why not it's smoke but she's smaller than you okay so we need a bigger piece of paper okay all right fair enough thank you thank you very much so we've determined that a child cannot fit through this piece of paper right brother Andres it's impossible correct because you're a man right well you're a young man your mom and he says he's a man so everybody under s he is a man so that's why he can he can tell the scripture can you put this up for us the scripture we were reading last Luke 18:27 so with men under this it's impossible with men to fit your body into this piece of paper just told us all right we're going to do something here that when God when when man says it's impossible God says it's possible sometimes things don't work out the way thank you appreciate that sometimes things are just better with music you know everybody's all intense right now you know this was so much easier in my kitchen with nobody staring at me than it is with like a hundred people staring at me so by the way thank you for your attention and I appreciate that it makes me feel a lot better you know hold on I'm out thank you I was telling brother David before we started I said you know the scariest or the most nervous times I've had we're not in that convention now it's a children's church flat-out because it means you guys if we lose you we know we've lost you guys are just like so it's important to have your attention good this is not a magic trick okay not a magician but I want you I want you two to see something that when man says it's impossible to fit yourself through a piece of paper God has another plan we have no idea what God's plan is but this is what God does when he starts working out his plan what are these alright what thank you sister alright good job so God starts and says haha those guys over there in Las Cruces believe it's impossible to fit a human being through an eight and a half by 11 inch piece of copy paper want to let you know this demonstration is sponsored by our tape library thank you very much please see them immediately after service guys are awesome loving that all right God starts to do something he starts to cut uh-oh what is it [Music] I just started come on guys very funny guys [Music] people get so impatient you believe that start playing jeopardy music come on remember that's almost done oh I'm gonna need somebody Matt I need a big person so brother Matt's gonna help us okay we determined we cannot fit a child cannot fit through a piece of paper much less an adult but here's God starts keeps on cutting he's working [Music] and he's working and [Music] almost done so here we go in life man that test was so hard it's impossible for anyone to pass this test when you're small things in life are humongous right things in life are so difficult we say wow there's no way that it's possible for me to pass this test there's no way I can do this but remember in the beginning we said it's impossible for man to fit through this piece of paper and that was by a man brother Matt we took a piece of paper and said Matt try and fit yourself through here can't be done how are we but God oh he has a special way it's a way that we have no idea how he's going to do it but I tell you guys if you have just a little bit of faith just like what you have right now you had faith in me right that I could do something right but imagine if you had a little faith in God and God said hey whatever you're going through it's okay you're gonna pass through it it's possible so now what we have done is we've gotten a piece of paper eight-and-a-half by 11 inches and we've created a way that men can go through this piece of paper so remember what was impossible to you guys it's it's possible with God he just did it pretty simple right anybody else want to try it you're thinking and anybody else wanna try it come on undress undress was the biggest skeptic he said it can't be done thank you my man so remember one thing if you get one thing tonight with God with God what all things are what all things are possible imagine that how many want to give just maybe just a short testimony of something that was impossible just so we could share come on sup sister she raised her hands so fast so I want you thank you it's to a possible all right yeah anybody else want to share just just something with with everyone that says yeah I had a hard time line up sister come on gentlemen come on gentlemen tell us okay then so everyone I hope that blesses you I hope that helped you a little bit is it helped anybody remember in your situations God has it under control and you can get whatever you have and say you know what Lord you're going to take me through it just as simple as this piece of paper thank you guys appreciate
