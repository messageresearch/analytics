pastor for this for the opportunity that was that was given to me just to to accompany him on this trip you know i was uh i was thinking as we were there um you saw the video or the for the portion of video where there was an ordination of of a brother and i said my how how how wonderful god is that just a few months ago we were there in uganda estaba in uganda there was an ordination of 300 pastors you know we uh yeah we take things for granted sometimes las and in norway i i took something for granted i took the night for granted la and your body says okay it's time to go to sleep well over there yeah i mean i i had never experienced this via experiment heard a lot about it but you know there was there was times that you know we were we were fellowshipping with the brothers you're just enjoying your fellowship establishes and you look at your watch and i wonder what time it is look at it oh my goodness it's 11 30 at night it's still light outside and your body is like still light you don't need to go to bed necessity i'm tired but i just doesn't feel like it i think brother tommy said it the best he said we understand that the lord or that god he made the world and everything that we know in six days you know it's just a beautiful beautiful country um as far as uh as a country that is all about clean energy i believe it leads the world in that electric vehicles [Music] electric you know if you want to go to a country where you don't see trash everywhere sometimes you feel like you come back to the states and you're in the third world country you know speaking with with them they really take a lot of pride in in their country you know no matter where you go no importa if it's south america mexico uganda america mexico uganda you have a people pueblo that truly really and deeply profundament with all their might all their strengths typical big big city very diverse many people from different different countries and i remember one restaurant recordo restaurant there was a there was a man and he came to talk to us and he ended up being he was from from uh guadalajara i think or mexico city one of the two yeah guadalajara the mexico so so he starts speaking spanish to us so we asked well what do you do you so a few minutes later we see this dishwasher just walking around is and he's there kind of ordering people what to do you know telling them what to do so brother tommy says this this guy's not a dishwasher this guy we asked me at the very end and he ends up being the owner but it was uh it was something because of the of the of the pride he was taking um in his job but he was so proud of of of the country he was in the establishment to serve people there and you get that from from everywhere you go you know with um with the brothers in there yeah winter brother morton's uh son-in-laws he's from ecuador ecuador so i don't speak a lot of spanish here in here here in the states but i probably spoke more spanish in norway than i have ever had in anywhere espanol they were singing in in russian there was a brother that brother freddy freddy he sang us a special in spanish special in espanol they sing in norwegian and then we sing in english so i tell you was such a such a blessing to hear songs in a different it's amazing to be part es of of a work that i know each and everyone is see that the way that the holy spirit works and not just saying okay well you just started church in there and whatever you want to do no they would ask so many questions how do we do this how do we work in the music how do we work on the audio come on audio i mean question after question that through our brother tommy and through and through our pastor pastor was just placed you know it's what a wonderful what a wonderful foundation to be part of esto how to how to set a how to set a a a church an order neglect but we bring our greetings from all of them you know we they uh especially brother morton his son-in-law and and his sons-in-law for all the with you all this move this afternoon may god bless [Applause] amen god bless brother william william god bless his word that we heard this morning it is wow what more can you say wow i i was telling our pastor that is the best message i have uh and and that i have and uh we don't want to take the word of god like just just like anything and there are people around the world that are depending upon what you do here and i don't think and i i put myself at the top river i put myself that i i don't don't don't think that we really realize what impact this little church has had around the world but all the way all the way i would who would have thought it all the way to norway you would think because we're so close to the borders of course mexico and latin america mexico and america but it's surreal but to to think about about uh and now that the the that the whole continent of europe has been open to us was there rescued off the coast of norway that a hundred over a hundred years later his descendants would go to establish a church in that same country to be able to to see what we have seen to be able to accomplish accompany our pastor pastor and sister lorena herrmann lorena for the william adamanna william and those that will subsequently go lost it has been something out of this world i passed we passed by uh uh uh just maybe uh a patch of flowers violet in color and i looked at those violet flowers flores tears came to my eyes if she could see us now and i know that the lord lets them see through the banister of time what a time we had and i'm going to say this again we don't really realize what we have what god has done through us in a travesty a man fully consecrated to him by god's grace he said i ain't going to be that man i aim to be that many and so the the simplicity of the gospel is simply the simplicity of the gospel is this yes is that we have come too far to ever go back to go back to what god has revealed himself like never before god and its power as you heard this morning you found out that god every scripture is god breathed vienna uh uh it comes to being it comes to production venezera a production production when you go out on the field the field el campo is something that my papa would always say that it is the greatest place to be i i come come with uh with uh for a few minutes minutos wanting to with all my heart to go and spend a month there in norway to go spend another month in uganda and that was was what the word of god what brought him to to to to be with this ministry the bible speaks to us in the book of saint mark chapter 4 and the same day and the same day when he was even come on he saith unto them let us pass over to the other side i believe that the word of god it has the answer for our days i believe that the word of god is real i believe that the word of god will produce in you what it said it will produce i believe that the word of god is i will draw it defends its own self the defendant is that's what the word of god will do in his life if you have problems in your life you haven't let the word of god loose if you have problems we have problems with not believing the word of god is testament of what the holy spirit is doing i am just a man we are just men but we are men that believe god we not only by god's grace we're able to establish the church there but also by god's grace to provide for their future fortune i told our pastor what i'd give to be 20 years younger oh come on to give to see all these young men and now brother mark is 26 years old hermano by what god has done for us today and then that's when they probably wish they lived in new mexico but new mexico beautiful as norway we just don't have the water natural water is what we're talking about spiritual water spiritual is coming here from the desert established all the way to the very scandinavian country base where in finland which is two countries next door sweden and
