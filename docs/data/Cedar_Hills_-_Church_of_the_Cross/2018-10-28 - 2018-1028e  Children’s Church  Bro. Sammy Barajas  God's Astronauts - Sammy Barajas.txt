are ready for takeoff ten nine eight seven six five four three two one wait what's going on no no my spaceship ain't going anywhere it's supposed to take off you guys I'm an astronaut and that's my spaceship tape it's about the best spaceship you can get see but I'm not just any astronaut I'm God's astronaut [Music] and he's my father and I'm on a mission to get home but my spaceship it's not going anywhere so I need you guys's help desperately does anybody have any ideas there may be something I can read or some tips on how I can get home oh absolutely bro absolutely you know what I need your help I'm gonna ask you to do something very dangerous don't be scared parents you'll be okay usually go inside my spaceship and I think I left my Bible in there can you do that okay let's go careful we might get lost oh yeah quick all right thank you so the Bible I need everyone in here pick one hand up I'll go like this now pick your notes I'm just kidding I don't don't think he knows don't pick you're in holes okay I'm kidding not now this is for real one hand up we got B I be L e mommy knows what that spells yeah exactly so we got B for basic instructions before leaving Earth you see that God's Word is just perfect it fits and everything okay now I need a sister's help where are the sisters can you reach for me you want to read a scripture hop unit we're gonna read second kings 2:11 you guys all want to open up your instructions and you read it with us second Kings 2:11 and the time that David and it came to pass as they still went on and talked that behold there appeared a chariot of fire and horses of fire and parted them both asunder and Elijah went up by a whirlwind into heaven wow you guys imagine that Elijah and Elijah just talking having a normal conversation probably about the Lord because that's what they were about and so while they were talking a chariot and horses of fire came down picture it like a rocket ship came down and it picked up Elijah to come back home to his father isn't that awesome yeah that's amazing no Elijah he was one of God's astronauts also and guess what I mean I have a nice fancy space suit and nice fancy rocket ship but Elijah didn't need that no he is a matter of fact the Bible says before he took off he took off his mantle he took off his spacesuit and then he took off into heaven you say well brother how how was he gonna make it in space he's he's gonna die up there in the atmosphere he's not gonna be able to breathe maybe he's gonna freeze well how many knows what this spacesuit is for for oxygen her hair protection yes all those are good answers but it was to keep it's to keep the astronaut pressurized it keeps him safe from the environment but Eliezer still didn't have one but I'll tell you one thing he did have that was God in his heart and guess what each and every one of you have God in your hearts also you know that yeah now he knows Elijah most of you guys know Elijah right but for those who don't I'm gonna give you a little bit of background Elijah was God's powerful prophet not only a prophet but he was also an astronaut and in the days of Elijah there was a king this King his name was Ahab like every other King but he made one mistake he married a girl named Jay yeah I'm sorry I can't say it does anyone know who King Ahab married Jezebel there we go and this Jezebel she was a nasty stinky alien no she didn't like Elijah because of Iser condemned her and he said because you paint your face green God's gonna condemn you I got a treat for you guys because I've brought her you guys gonna see what she looks like you don't want to see her I kind of don't want to see her either so this is just about pretty ugly huh yeah disgusting see she has her lipstick and makeup and she painted her whole face green I don't know why I don't know if guys like green faces but anyways god condemned her and he told her what was going to happen to him and to keep it short this is Jezebel this is very sharp like God's Word and boom she was gone just like that yes you got burned to the ground he say whoa brother sound this is all great stories but how is that gonna help our spaceship take off well we have an advisor in our day don't we yeah who is our Elisha nah Elijah's brother branham yes Weiser brother Brennaman what did he bring he brought a message for us yes sir he did and if Elijah held God's Word in his heart his day if we hold the God's Word in our heart this day what's gonna happen well the Bible says that God is the same yesterday today and forever so if we go back to the basic instructions to the Bible we hold that in our heart God's gonna perform he's gonna do the same things he did for Elijah all right so God's Word is like fuel and I have a good idea why my spaceship didn't take off because I forgot to stop at the gas station and put gas in it hey just simple as that I'm sorry yeah but God's Word to us is fuel we'll hold it in our hearts it just fuels us and we're almost ready to take off but there's one thing missing yeah and maybe my my spaceship is just tilted a little bit and it's not going straight up how it's supposed to it looks a little bit tricky to me doesn't it yeah well God's Word also says through our Elijah through the message of the hour says that the way up is down how many knows what the way you're up is down means hey let me show you all these little kids to end up okay now while you're standing I'm going to tell you something brother Branham says that you can see the way the church you guys is headed by the way they're praying so we'll take that the way up is down you guys do exactly what I'm doing we're gonna pray I say Lord Jesus we thank you and we love you and we come before you just asking that you would help our brother Sammy and his rocket ship to take off amen you guys would straighten it up hurry now the way up is down now that we got our fuel we got our spaceship pointed in the right direction I'm gonna share something with you guys that God shared with me one night he came to me in a dream and he showed me in the church and we were sitting in a circle and brother Benji was guarding the door and brother Jimmy was showing us how to strap in and guess what we're about to do we're about to take off now we're about to get outta here so now that we've got our instructions all settled let's give it a go what do you guys say yeah all right let's do this I need a countdown from you guys all right you guys can give me a countdown starting from 1 to 7 come follow me 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 oh oh all right well thank you guys for your help I'm going home now god bless you guys [Music] [Applause] that was awesome [Applause] right so how many learned something yeah who wants to be an astronaut you know yeah they make pretty good money but who wants to be an astronaut for God okay I see the first row by the second row we get like three and not very many parents much oh okay now the parents want to be astronauts - do you wanna be an astronaut I want to be an astronaut yeah let's get it alright just go ahead and stand up I sing that song what are we singing today this little light of mine we're gonna see I'm not the song leader he is I'm just here to help him out [Music] [Music] [Applause] it's little so while he was strong leading I did a little counting and I can't see very good that's why I wear glasses and um it seems like a lot of us have our lights hidden under the bush oh no we don't want to hide our lines under the bush do we do we want to hurt her our light under the bush hmm because then we'd be in darkness right do we want to be in darkness I know I don't so if you were one of the ones who had your light under a bush that's let's shine our light real bright let's see there we go so let's go ahead and we'll hide it under a bushel No [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] and now that we got our lights lit up that means now we can have the victory right I heard three yeses from the front row how many have the victory this evening that's a lot better Victoria [Music] we [Music] Hey Joe [Music] who told you to get behind them so when we saying that because

of the young men there you go I didn't even say what it was for and he won't you come with your meal I have you pretty dismiss [Laughter] so if we could all just bow our heads and close our eyes we'll be getting at that point where we'll be dismissive please bow your heads dear loquacious and how many Father Lord we are coming before you this afternoon were asking that you can protect us and be
