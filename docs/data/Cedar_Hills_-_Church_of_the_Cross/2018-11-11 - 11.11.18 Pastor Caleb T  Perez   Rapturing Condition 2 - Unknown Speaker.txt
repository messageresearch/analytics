I start with this quote that that that we read last time where comments like when is that right okay this is where we we base it all from yak is not the lowest ah most although this is fellowship by Redemption it is but it is no parade until then he says the place that we go into anywhere on the interim moose until we return back as the correct statement is not a place of brick no su lugar de la 3u and mortar it's a man I know clay or they were precious stones or jewels for the Preciosa spirit as before yes it's a place it's been regard of condition the condition now we focused on that last time and we want it we want to keep focusing on this get a mistake it in focus a place of condition that's all you gotta take on this your that we move out of this dimension Dennis Alamos a study means to you that we live it liquid that we live into into another dimension and it's a house a tabernacle or a dwelling it's when excess I won't ever knock you on them whatever so then if the believers position is in Christ in a position that current is increased oh and Christ is heavenly places if he stirs new catalysts yes then the believers position is a condition that we must go into total opposition Delacroix Yenta isn't a condition and I read this in fact from our founding pastor Leo s or the Nestor water just for those maybe that weren't here if parents can understand where we're going today in OCD he moves and he says this in the message the mystery of his will and Mysterio and he saved me brother Branham says he's quoting him it does it and eliminar on this economy salvo said now you must find your position in Christ he says position increased oh but the first thing you got to do before you find your position in Christ al Oprah you know que tiene que sientes in contra su position increase you've gotta get rid of that idea that you're ever going to be lost in this case a loser less yelling because tests a lot better than if you're still toying with the idea mister clinger-cohen si well I don't know if I'm gonna make it no stereo Sheila West I don't know if I'm gonna be saved or since it was a sigh he says you got to get rid of that idea chemical substances yeah I believe this morning you're an estimate yeah we have a big trash can here get them in with some gumbo we can all get rid of a lot ideas that we have I have ideas that you want to get rid of listening is a let's get inside he is that that somebody's better than you they say they're the Quechan is me her ideas that God loves everyone else more than he loves you look at you little Sam I thought of Muscatine those ideas that you have to be good so that you can make the rapture they see that Catina case there there's a lot that come to us I'm which I see that when I won't throw in the trash get then it was scary that lasted a message that my dad was preaching on the rapture mr. McKittrick on me pal and he says every every idea that's wrong they say carry a case that Roni and he would say those are ideas of Don caca wotty those are eight years don't karate that's right of the peanut man yeah yeah they're right there ideas that who knows where they come from soon as SK consolidate don't descend here Don but I want you to to get that pair okey-dokey here have put away the idea that you're ever gonna be lost once again personally there cos they're on the pill you cannot ever be in the rapture no I play the sadness or not thinking that you're gonna be lost son Lucas ever better they gotta get that idea and we gotta throw it in the trash Jimmy can I say they Piniella love a Sulha and that's one of the hardest things for a human to do yes soon I'll ask oh so much would ask us get rid of an idea you need because for one an idea what can i risk if any that has gone into the mind he can throw them in that has been accepted by a human being yes yourself telepon amano it is almost impossible to eradicate discuss the impossibility way I'm gonna say that again right that we get a lot of ideas then which I see a lot of thought would you spin cement ideas it is it means this get it I see this it's any conception is quick it concept soon existing in the mind existing element as a result of mental understanding a motor so talent elemental meant an awareness or activity they do not TV that all ideas an impression or an opinion do name press your know your opinion of view or a belief Yona beast they mr. McCray insya and an idea is also a groundless supposition or fantasy only there isn't a fantasy I'll go seem fundamental an idea is a conception of what is desirable you know there has been a concepción they'll go this year and it can also be a mental image that means they don't need them and that is why we have to get rid of all our ideas what is it any case as they don't know it tosses any idea that cannot be verified but get me there can request a pity for not founded upon God's Word is Antichrist idea as soon as the other crystal must be removed by the root it in the case of this ray God Allah is relevant search because I can't because those ideas are what is hindering us today but case I see their son las que no sister no you cannot move out of our condition into another look when was in Telugu they will not cook this you know only glad we have too many ideas forget them which I see there when you when you talk to people but the LA was gonna say well I guess I'll never be able to do this or have this this is not what you said is why there are too many things that that that are impeding or keeping it from happening what can we just closed a case a low-impedance there Cantus era but this is why people rarely change their dwelling places put a still a hint them which is Escambia because people can't move out of the condition or can open at least they will knock on this you mean that there are too many ideas indicate emphasis they that have taken root in their soul remember what we talked about last last Sunday a quality local em was a little more soul is what determines the condition of the spirits Ellen must locate them in a lock on this yonder because no soul is the nature of that spirit porque la mulana to release a list now if we can get rid of those ideas see those promises like get them and throw them in the trash yes I see the official doing so porque put a certain you start to see your condition change Santa Senators to condition K come because it's the ideas that keep you bound for case also see a skeleton in a silo sane is very good is that a masters move when drawing ideas in our head and polyandry they are sinister I think you all fight a fight without everyday huh look at those belly I'm most convenient least get a few hundred ideas every day but - Stella theology agency cannot even say a thousand but no I still mean listen we get a lot of funny ideas on Megan Mucha cetera and then when you really stop and think about it local no para pensar then you ask yourself you you you you you have to ask yourself this yellow se tiene que una pregunta res where did that idea come from they don't Diego stay there maybe we heard it or it's a slow mo maybe somebody on the news or somebody had a great idea the problem is is that we're married it's gossip that Moses says that's what ideas are their seeds let's see there's ones to Mia's and and those seeds make us bitter and angry here's the semiosis in a matter goes hello how was last the model and and that's the hardest that it brings yes is let go say Chucky try our ideas let's see there yeah they really play a lot of favoritism in that church boy for what it is that's somebody's idea so when you follow that what those tests II guess you ask yourself the question before you plant the seed so they make a salute and discipline the harvest am I gonna have with that kick lesson about how many really stop and think for a moment that up in how do you ever stop when you get an idea still they see when he's there and say what will the results be of this idea Karen us in Lourdes what does they stay there come on think about this for a moment didn't say pure water what will the harvest be of this idea give us a lick Costa it's gotta be planted listen so what will the hardest be come on Sara la cosecha ask yourself before you let any idea coming to you but it won't descent as they call Katie they are interested what will my harvest look like como se llama Donna me cosecha if I permit this seed to be planted in me see your parameter Krista cement a Zeppelin telling me how many know that the rapture is a revelation what to say sorry Cal righto soon arrival as soon I'm gonna tell you this morning the way I see this term onion rapture is not an idea kale wrapped on no as soon as they are we're Tommy for the Tommy not long ago mr. Motta MassMutual we talked about the idea of loyal delay they're gonna tell you once again the rapture is not an idea I don't know a Sunni then people think because well I can I can quote the whole message of the rapture which I wrapped that still don't mean you're going in the rapture so no kissy Kissy one you can quote the whole thing but how much of it are you living get that illegal video now we're getting into the nitty-gritty of it estamos dando else into the rapture is a revelation it wasn't a trivial SEO it is a condition that you have come into a zoo nakhon this you know in this day I take a bow and I don't know how many people understand that condition you know system which is again it is a revelation meaning that it is a condition that you come into it's when a condition on the sketchy guy now here's brother branham and the message perfect faith a Castelli man a runner in and so when a man lives by faith and walks by faith even Delambre be the perfect I mean a brain substance faith or face who stands here mr.

balance to this 4k imbalance name is due and when we look at this because the llama Ramos it's where people get the idea don't they like hint the static only that sense it was an unconditional covenant but we don't think on this you know that we don't have to meet any conditions not that Nikon this units para uno Wow I'm gonna say it again people believe that because it was an unconditional love in the tricky part is that no conditions have to be met can write condiciones Kor because not more by himself but because you screwed up order and therefore there's nothing that we have to do and this is night market then it was carry careful with that without open in so you're walking a fine line many people today system which I can't they all you sit in church just yep done any list yeah thinking they're in a good condition and okay tendon not because anyways vice Grace were saved I'll tell escape or de gracias elect I'm gonna be unless you know what's their number and if got elected
