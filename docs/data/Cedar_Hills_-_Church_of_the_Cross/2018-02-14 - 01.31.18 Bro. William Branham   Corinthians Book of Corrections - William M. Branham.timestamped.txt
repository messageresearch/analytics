[16:07] Correction amen
[16:40] wanted to just come by and see them this
[16:43] morning the reason I dropped in so now
[16:45] over in the book of Korean just about
[16:49] the tenth chapter and the first four or
[16:52] five verses let's just meditate on that
[16:54] for a few moments our brother can have
[16:56] time to preach now let's bow our heads
[16:59] first this in his presence blessed it a
[17:03] heavenly father
[17:05] it is indeed with grateful hearts that
[17:08] we bow humbly before the this day to
[17:11] thank thee for the good things of life
[17:14] and realizing that life itself is just
[17:19] one great struggle if we're not having
[17:23] it in one way we are in another but some
[17:26] glorious day the battle will be over and
[17:30] we'll see Jesus who we have looked
[17:33] forward to seeing since we have loved
[17:36] him and become acquainted with him in a
[17:38] relative chewing and we're so happy to
[17:42] know that someday we shall see him now
[17:45] today as we pulled up under the old oak
[17:49] as it was for comfort like Abraham
[17:53] sitting there waiting and God and two
[17:56] angels come up and spoke to him and
[17:59] we're just expecting you to come to us
[18:01] this morning and speak to our hearts
[18:03] through thy word Lord as we fellowship
[18:06] around it bless our dear beloved pastor
[18:10] Lord we pray that you'll give him
[18:13] strength and courage we pray that you'll
[18:16] bless the little church and the Deacons
[18:19] and all that's concerned your Lord and
[18:22] all that comes here not only here but
[18:25] other places your Church Universal bless
[18:29] our visiting brethren who are with us
[18:30] this morning in the service we pray that
[18:33] you will be with them and sustain them
[18:35] forgive us of our sins and speak to us
[18:38] through that word we asked in Christ's
[18:40] name Amen if I'm not mistaken brother
[18:45] Coates is sitting here this morning he
[18:47] was over to pray for another night of
[18:49] Veterans Hospital cancer and we're glad
[18:53] to see you in here this morning brother
[18:55] and sister Coates now in the book of
[18:59] Corinthians the tenth chapter this book
[19:04] of Corinthians is a book of Correction
[19:07] we should take the book of Corinthians
[19:10] it's the only church and all of the New
[19:15] Testament that's seemingly that the
[19:17] leaders had such trouble with but
[19:20] Corinthians of always in trouble Paul
[19:24] when he come among them one had a tongue
[19:27] and one had a psalm and one adds of
[19:29] feeling in a sensation and he's always
[19:32] having trouble with these corinthians
[19:34] keep them straight if we notice he
[19:37] couldn't teach the corinthians deep
[19:38] things they were just a baby fashion
[19:43] they he couldn't go to him in a great
[19:47] deep the messages that he did to the
[19:50] Ephesians and he did to the Romans and
[19:52] teach to them the deep things because it
[19:55] wasn't able to take it they depended too
[19:58] much up on little sensations and little
[20:01] things like that just well I've raised
[20:04] the Lord I got a I had a revelation come
[20:07] to me I had a psalm I have a prophecy
[20:09] Paul's at all these things of things see
[20:13] every one of them they're just not to be
[20:15] trusted too much and so but what he's
[20:20] trying to get to the church was that
[20:22] anchor where we where we have an anchor
[20:27] in Christ where that we don't trust up
[20:30] on sensations we don't trust upon
[20:32] revelations we don't trust these things
[20:35] only we trust Christ that's by your
[20:38] faith that we move out there junkies we
[20:41] notice Paul could teach the Ephesians
[20:43] there how that before the foundation of
[20:46] the world they were predestinated unto
[20:49] the adoption of the sons of God he the
[20:52] Corinthians northing about that they
[20:53] just they had to have a little feeling
[20:55] or something little sensation one this
[20:57] another and they depended on that he
[21:00] couldn't teach them the deep things so I
[21:02] think it's a great when you got a people
[21:06] that you can teach these things in the
[21:08] Holy Spirit can wine these great truths
[21:11] and anchor it into the the people's
[21:13] hearts so they know where they're
[21:15] standing Space Station aural sensation a
[21:17] prophecy or an old prophecy that
[21:20] whatever it might be whatever event we
[21:22] don't when I remember we're not I'm not
[21:24] trying to say that God does not deal
[21:26] through prophecy and things like that
[21:28] but we don't rely upon that we got a
[21:30] deeper hole and that could be re said
[21:33] wherever there is offices it'll fail
[21:35] where there's tons it'll cease and where
[21:38] these and all these sensations of those
[21:40] gradients had not one of them of the
[21:43] evidence that they were saved
[21:44] not one of them wasn't evidence that
[21:48] they were saved not if you could shout
[21:51] if you could prophesy if you could heal
[21:53] the sick if you could speak with tongues
[21:55] if you could interpret tongues if you
[21:57] had wisdom and knowledge none of those
[21:59] mean you're safe not on them you're
[22:01] gonna have every one of them Paul said
[22:03] in first Corinthians 13 and be lost
[22:05] I am nothing see but when you got love
[22:08] an anchor this morning for about an hour
[22:12] before the wife woke up I was awake and
[22:16] the Lord was revealing to me a great
[22:19] something about how God has his church
[22:22] together but that bonds of love and how
[22:25] it must be there's not another way for a
[22:28] man to ever be saved without being born
[22:31] again
[22:31] God willing I want to preach on that
[22:34] this coming week and just giving macare
[22:37] lives in my heart maybe the Lord will
[22:39] give me a message on it now this message
[22:41] this morning has to come to my heart in
[22:44] there is a message of warning and I
[22:48] thought maybe if we would get this
[22:50] warning to the people as Paul was
[22:53] warning these Corinthians if we can get
[22:55] this warning to the people knowing that
[22:59] we're facing a revival now and an
[23:01] examining time when we must be examined
[23:04] now Paul said moreover brethren I would
[23:08] not that you should be ignorant
[23:10] how that all our fathers were under the
[23:13] cloud and all passed through the sea and
[23:18] were baptized unto Moses in the cloud
[23:21] and in the sea now he's giving them an
[23:27] understanding that when God brought out
[23:30] Israel from the wilderness into the
[23:34] wilderness to serving and to take them
[23:36] to the promised land they setting forth
[23:40] an example there that as we are brought
[23:44] out in all the material things all the
[23:48] rituals and the ardors they were the
[23:52] same and we find on down a little
[23:55] farther in our lesson that many of those
[23:58] were overthrown because they could do
[24:01] all the rituals and all the orders and
[24:03] everything that God required and still
[24:06] their hearts wasn't right with God now
[24:10] we can do many things we can take
[24:13] communion we can be baptized we can we
[24:16] can come to church have our names on the
[24:20] book or be just as respected revered as
[24:23] we can be and still be lost that's a
[24:29] solemn warning we can be justice just
[24:33] rejoice when the spirit would fall and
[24:36] in a meeting where the word was being
[24:38] preached in our souls would just rejoice
[24:41] with the word and still be lost the rain
[24:46] falls on the just and the unjust the
[24:50] same rain that makes the wheat grow
[24:52] makes the weed growth it's the nature of
[24:55] the product see it's a nature of it that
[24:59] tells what we are therefore it's the
[25:03] nature that's in it that tells what we
[25:06] are seeing not we might be so religious
[25:11] that we wouldn't turn our hands on
[25:12] Sunday to do a thing we might not even
[25:15] take a stitch at our toes on Sunday we
[25:18] might not even feel justified device
[25:20] food
[25:21] on Sunday and we might be soul related
[25:25] and sold higher but yet if we are not
[25:31] literally born again of the Spirit of
[25:34] God
[25:34] we're just worshiping and vain so now
[25:39] it's pretty stiff and we want to really
[25:43] find it and know the truth because
[25:45] remember we're not going to get a second
[25:48] chance at this it's just this one time
[25:52] so you better be real sure now I notice
[25:56] I would not have you ignorant brethren
[26:00] now these Corinthians wanted us to enter
[26:02] firstly they were facing as their
[26:05] eternal hopes up on some sensation
[26:10] Paul said just there said when I come
[26:13] among you one as this one as that and
[26:17] what what that now all that's all right
[26:20] we have nothing against but but still
[26:22] that isn't what we're talking about see
[26:25] that isn't it I remember when I was
[26:30] first converted and I begin to see the
[26:34] working of the Spirit and how that Sun
[26:36] could just impersonate the real genuine
[26:42] Holy Spirit and it's just such a way
[26:45] that it would why it was just impossible
[26:47] to tell which was right and wrong Arlie
[26:50] and I seen a man that I knew and I and
[26:55] Bob discernment I knew that man was
[26:57] living with another man's wife and here
[27:02] he was standing there speaking with
[27:04] tongues and interpreting and everything
[27:07] and giving messages and it was enough
[27:09] got the other fella to a place to work I
[27:12] could speak to him a few moments in a
[27:14] real genuine Christian and I thought how
[27:19] can that spirit the same spirit where I
[27:25] that's when I first seen Pentecost and
[27:29] it was at Mishawaka Indiana and I said
[27:32] yeah it's certainly I thought for the
[27:33] first few hours I there I was among
[27:35] angels and the next few hours I thought
[27:38] I was in the hunk demons when I seen
[27:41] that scene these two men one give a
[27:43] message what a jerk I never heard
[27:45] speaking in tongues and things like that
[27:46] before
[27:47] now watch those spirits how they move
[27:50] about all my while the great little lamb
[27:53] has begun and then when I got a chance
[27:57] on the outside to talk to one of them
[27:59] and could tell what he was made from
[28:02] there was one is evil as he could be and
[28:06] that night I watched him again I thought
[28:09] all get me away from here I can't
[28:12] understand how this is and I've seen
[28:14] those things were in the Bible but here
[28:17] was one doing it that didn't have the
[28:19] Spirit of God and the other one doing it
[28:21] it didn't have the Spirit of God then I
[28:23] was all confused and I just left the
[28:25] whole thing go and years later after the
[28:29] flood was over I was going walking up
[28:32] the road going to greens mill mister
[28:34] eyes for the state senator comes here is
[28:37] Church he's met me on the road he put
[28:39] his arms around me said Billy what does
[28:41] Christ mean to you now my father was
[28:44] gone my brother was gone and my wife was
[28:47] gone my baby was gone I said what does
[28:49] it mean I said mister I'm sure he means
[28:52] more than life to me I said something
[28:56] has happened within me years ago
[29:00] Christ came to my heart and I it's just
[29:04] become more than I am myself it's just
[29:07] something that's happened it wasn't
[29:10] because I was religious it wasn't it's
[29:12] just something that God Jude the grace
[29:15] did for me and I said oh he would slay
[29:19] me I'd trust him just the same
[29:21] and if I was in hell and there was such
[29:24] a thing as love and hell I'd still love
[29:26] him that's how a man it's something in
[29:28] here he's right I deserve every
[29:32] punishment that I ever got you do the
[29:35] same even if that ain't
[29:38] that's something that anchor of love of
[29:43] God that holds in the human heart other
[29:46] things becomes secondary setting on a
[29:49] log up there I was praying about
[29:52] something else and my Bible come open
[29:55] and I was reading and over in the book
[29:58] of Hebrews the sixth chapter and I was
[30:00] reading there how that it is impossible
[30:03] for those who were once enlightened and
[30:06] may protectors of the Holy Spirit see as
[30:08] they follow it to renew themselves to
[30:10] give up to repentance far the rain come
[30:13] up off upon the earth to water it to
[30:17] dressing which is prepared but that
[30:19] which is 9/2 rejection thorns and
[30:22] systems which is not into rejection is
[30:24] to be burned and the Holy Spirit kept
[30:27] speaking to me about that what is that I
[30:31] don't read it over again and then
[30:33] Ephesian come
[30:34] I stole the world standing before me
[30:36] journey there's all disc it up and I
[30:40] Cloudant ready for a plane and there
[30:43] when a man by white soaring seen and
[30:47] after he went around the curvature of
[30:48] the earth another man come and black
[30:50] sowing seeds behind him and one of the
[30:53] thieves are a good man stowed come up
[30:55] what sweet and the bad and black man
[30:57] sowed the seeds come up from dressed in
[30:59] black it come up and it was weed and oh
[31:03] what was contrary to the other a great
[31:06] drought come in the vision and the
[31:08] little wheat bowed its head it was just
[31:10] so thirsty for a drink and the weed
[31:14] bowed his head it was thirsty for a
[31:16] drink not a great cloud come over and
[31:18] rains come down in the loop
[31:21] wheat raised up him again the screen
[31:23] praise the Lord praise the Lord
[31:25] it was so happy to get that water and
[31:27] the little weed raised up again a holler
[31:29] praise the Lord praise the Lord for the
[31:32] same water then I understood see there
[31:36] it is the Holy Spirit or fall but by
[31:40] their fruits they are no one said too
[31:43] large in 15 see not by the reaction of
[31:46] the spirit where they healed
[31:48] where they speak with tongues and where
[31:50] they sang in the spirit or whether they
[31:52] rejoice this to where that they can do
[31:54] all that and still be lost it's your
[31:59] life within you a barn begin experiment
[32:03] now Paul was trying to get this to those
[32:06] currencies
[32:07] I'm over over brother and I wouldn't
[32:09] have wouldn't have you Inger how that
[32:12] our fathers were all under the cloud and
[32:15] pass through the seat and we're back I
[32:19] unto Moses every one of them went into
[32:23] the wilderness jesus said not all that's
[32:27] there Lord Lord will enter in but the
[32:29] one that doeth the will of my father
[32:31] which is in heaven it isn't what you say
[32:34] you could preach the gospel to still be
[32:36] long certainly this is not just little
[32:40] kid stuff
[32:41] this is absolutely it's deep and
[32:46] Christianity is not to be just a little
[32:48] like fabulous thing like go over to
[32:51] church now it's my duty to go that uh
[32:54] Christianity brother Christianity isn't
[32:58] is something that God has done God has
[33:04] chosen you in Christ and percentage you
[33:08] as a love gift to Christ and if God's
[33:12] calling election and if we have the
[33:15] opportunity to become that type of
[33:18] person and turn it down for little
[33:21] things of the world now listen as we go
[33:24] on and all did eat that pain spiritual
[33:31] man did you hear that
[33:34] the third burst and all did eat the same
[33:39] spiritual manna
[33:41] what's he speaking up the rituals of the
[33:45] church people come to church and say
[33:48] they have repented and are baptized unto
[33:51] Christ taking on the name of the Lord
[33:53] Jesus and they did that in the
[33:56] wilderness also policy that's what the
[33:59] creek is it
[34:00] they come in in with baptized unto
[34:02] Christ on Christ outwardly
[34:06] professionally and taking it all
[34:08] intellectually had accepted in but
[34:12] rather it's a lot more than
[34:14] intellectuals it goes beyond that it
[34:18] goes to a genuine birth not just the
[34:23] middle conception argument emotional
[34:25] work but a firs and experience something
[34:31] it goes on down deep into the heart and
[34:34] changing in the innermost being that
[34:38] makes you do things that you would not
[34:41] have done other words it makes you love
[34:44] those who are unlovable it makes you at
[34:49] different than you ever thought that you
[34:51] would act it when situations arise
[34:53] it's your anchor you don't have to
[34:57] wonder will I make it
[34:58] oh no it is whether I'll make it it's
[35:02] already made for me Christ in me has
[35:06] made it himself and I just trust in his
[35:10] anchor alone what a wonderful thing
[35:15] notice they all took communion that like
[35:23] that was in we know that it was a
[35:26] natural process because it was the frost
[35:30] like that rained from heaven little
[35:32] wafers with honey on the wafer was just
[35:36] a little like a cracker the cookie and
[35:38] had honey over the top of it and they
[35:41] all work for takers of that everyone
[35:46] passed through the Ritz
[35:48] see he was baptized to the cloud and
[35:51] through the sea on to Moses following
[35:56] his instructions of God's service they
[35:59] were all baptized unto Him they were all
[36:01] followers as we are today led by the
[36:04] Holy Spirit the great instructor of the
[36:08] Christian
[36:08] Church we are led through to water
[36:12] baptism and he said they all taken of
[36:15] the same manner the what did it do that
[36:20] manna fell far Korah and for his group
[36:25] just as same as it did for Moses Caleb
[36:28] and Joshua they were all mixed together
[36:32] all four takers of baptism all four
[36:37] takers of membership all four takers of
[36:41] confession now all four takers of the
[36:45] communion you get look at that solemn
[36:52] wine and Tabernacle folks gift that way
[36:58] down deep
[37:00] remember it's yours eternal destination
[37:05] hangs right there don't just pass it on
[37:11] like a little flutter or something this
[37:13] is something we must come respective to
[37:18] it's something that means whether we
[37:21] live you're after are not they were all
[37:25] baptized into Moses through the Red Sea
[37:27] they all follow that same spirit speed
[37:30] the cloud and the pillar of fire
[37:33] they're always led by the same angel
[37:36] they all come out for the same pasture
[37:38] they always baptized into sea they all
[37:41] eat off that spiritual manner and that
[37:45] manna was Christ Christ coming down the
[37:51] manna come down every night from heaven
[37:54] and perish here to sustain the people in
[37:58] their journey and Christ come from
[38:02] heaven and gave His life that whosoever
[38:06] believeth on him should not perish but
[38:08] have everlasting life
[38:10] Christ come down into chains are matter
[38:14] they eat all these things spiritual
[38:18] blessing therefore the Holy Spirit
[38:21] all riding on monks two people and both
[38:24] Christian and lukewarm and a half
[38:27] believers and borderline believers will
[38:29] all eat the same that doesn't mean it
[38:34] yet
[38:34] oh I wished I had worried that I could
[38:39] drive this down and stitch it in the
[38:42] heart of every person hear it see what a
[38:47] deep thing this is it isn't something to
[38:52] be played with

[39:21] destination up on the sensation can you
[39:25] see in this day that we're now living
[39:28] how that people are basing their their
[39:31] destination up all just a little
[39:33] sensation or say i know i got it they
[39:37] called us ah cup the power go through me

[39:43] truth and you're still lost oh if we

[39:52] first Corinthians 13 here just a moment
[39:54] and listen what Paul's got to say about
[39:56] it right here though I speak with
[39:59] tongues of men and angels and a have not
[40:02] charity which is love I am become as a
[40:06] sounding brass and an appealing symbol

[41:41] her name on the book that settles it how
[41:45] far they're all our Pentecostal people

[41:51] little sensation they felt good they
[41:52] spoke with tongues they got a little
[41:54] blood in your hands the lore on their
[41:55] face or something we got it Oh
[41:57] 10 million miles off you get see how the

[43:07] evil charity love what is love is God
[43:13] how does God come to you by birth see
[43:17] now they always baptized unto Moses they
[43:23] all did eat of the communion they all
[43:28] have the same spiritual matter that come
[43:32] from gotta every one of them eat the
[43:35] same thing and today we stand not around
[43:39] and hear the word and rejoice over and
[43:41] take them in and eat it and say all
[43:43] hallelujah that good
[43:45] all I appreciate that yes I was baptized
[43:48] in the church I take it make my
[43:50] profession I put my name on the book on
[43:53] the chart remember all that is perfectly
[43:57] in vain if there isn't something that
[44:02] God has done if it is done of the things
[44:07] that you did that's the things that your
[44:10] faith produce but unless God has done
[44:13] something to you to new birth
[44:16] just a moment down now the for first and
[44:19] it all drink the same spiritual rough
[44:23] fourth a drink of that spiritual rock
[44:28] that followed them and that rock was
[44:32] Christ
[44:36] they all drink from the fountain they
[44:39] rejoice that what does that mean though
[44:42] we end the week book rejoice to get that
[44:45] spiritual water we go to the church we
[44:49] clap our hands out with the rest of them
[44:51] we jump up and down on the floor with
[44:53] the rest of them we praise God for the
[44:56] rest of we prophesy with the rest seven
[44:58] weeks deacon tongues like the rest them

[45:08] them in a no on that rock
[45:10] wha right the rock wha cried it was
[45:19] there in literal farm as it is in
[45:22] spiritual farm today the man of the food
[45:25] which is the word that comes from God
[45:27] out of heaven right is the word of God
[45:32] and we eat the word see we stuff like
[45:38] them the message this morning within the
[45:40] listen our whole reach and grab that
[45:43] word we live by the words that they all
[45:46] eat that same spiritual manner and they
[45:50] all fit drinks all three of that things
[45:58] spiritual rough and that rough watts
[46:01] price think of it now what's he going to
[46:06] put it to it in here ease warning those
[46:09] Corinthians be careful what you're doing
[46:12] what I'll come alone you want as a psalm
[46:15] one is it turn one is with this in one
[46:17] half of that one has a proxy one has a
[46:19] revelation one's doing this and one's
[46:22] doing that be careful don't base your
[46:26] faith upon that those things are all
[46:31] right
[46:32] they got their place and in the church
[46:34] but don't never face your salvation on
[46:37] that if your life doesn't tally up to
[46:40] God's Word then it's time for a get
[46:44] right with God
[46:47] notice now and this rock this rock was a
[46:55] rock that was in the wilderness and I
[46:58] want you to notice when God called Moses
[47:01] and sent him down into Egypt to deliver
[47:05] the children of Israel from under the
[47:07] yoke of payroll he said what is that in
[47:12] thy hand and he said it's a stick and he
[47:16] tucked the stick and threw it on the
[47:17] ground and it became a serpent and he
[47:20] Moses fled then he picked it up and it
[47:23] become a stick in his hand and that rod
[47:27] when he got into Egypt he stretched it
[47:30] over Egypt and it flies come up he
[47:34] stretched it and plague fell it was God
[47:39] judgment God's judgment was in the
[47:43] stretching forth of the rod and the
[47:45] notice before that rod could really be
[47:47] handled Moses put his hand in his bosom
[47:50] it's become leprosy like every man is to
[47:54] begin with a sinner bad nature there's
[47:58] no way around it you're born in sin
[48:02] shapes and iniquity come to the world
[48:05] speaking lies you might have been
[48:08] dedicated on the altar on your mother's
[48:11] church she might have a wrinkle you
[48:13] might have been just that but you are a
[48:15] sinner to begin with then there is
[48:21] another what God said put your hand back
[48:25] into your bosoms
[48:27] over his heart he put his hands again as
[48:30] the commission of God where we brought
[48:32] forth first his hand a leper you were
[48:36] brought forth by God first eight tenor
[48:38] not the chart but by nature then you go
[48:43] back again and when you come out the
[48:45] hand was clean and perfect joint that
[48:48] this hand before could waive the
[48:50] judgment rod had to be a cleaned
[48:53] and the floor could play even any
[48:57] Minister any featured on heard something
[49:00] of mine that actually curdled my blood
[49:06] when I turned on my radio just before
[49:09] coming no disregard and of is anybody
[49:12] here relations as a person I don't mean
[49:14] to hurt you but it's time and God helped
[49:19] me to always be Christian enough to put
[49:23] make what black black and white white to
[49:28] be honest I heard someone singing and
[49:32] said I have my Testament and turn it on
[49:35] and read of Scripture and preached from
[49:38] the first stop blessed it is the Spanish
[49:42] that have gotten us feet of the stronger
[49:44] walketh in the way of sinners you know
[49:46] what
[49:47] that rock-and-roll God Ginny Oz burns
[49:50] from on the radio preaching the gospel
[49:54] oh brother if there ever was of disgrace
[49:59] a person like that has got no business
[50:03] moving into the word of the Living God
[50:08] and you picked this fellow the rich rose
[50:11] valley barn day up all night and whole
[50:13] shindig clapping her hands and going on
[50:16] an old shindig and the next morning
[50:18] change his voice around and talk like a
[50:21] Christian and why it's buggerin
[50:24] Delphinus in the side of God the hand
[50:28] that waves this judgment rod must be
[50:30] passed by the power of the resurrection
[50:34] of Christ got no business and the Word
[50:38] of God even a lot of preachers trying to
[50:41] justify this Elvis Presley which is
[50:45] nothing in the world but a modern Judas
[50:48] Iscariot Judas Iscariot got thirty
[50:51] pieces of silver elvis presley got a
[50:53] million dollars to flee to Cadillacs
[50:55] but he's sold out he was a Pentecostal
[50:58] believer and sold out his birth facts to
[51:01] become our rocket
[51:02] and since power off let's get hot don't
[51:06] pull any punches on it no sir and on
[51:10] modern judas iscariot
[51:12] and then even the ministers kind of up
[51:15] build that kind of a paint and he'll the
[51:19] princess and y'all trust God for my
[51:21] success how would a living holy God ever
[51:26] give success above guarantee and a devil
[51:31] denies that absolutely simple the
[51:35] greatest hindrance that this nation has
[51:37] ever seen is a guy like Elvis Presley
[51:40] who sent millions of souls to hell by
[51:44] his old dirty filthy rock'n'roll surely
[51:50] I don't have any apology at all you can
[51:54] leave me to be God's prophet remembers
[51:56] there is a incarnated devil absolutely
[52:02] and Jenny Osborne of those has got no
[52:04] business with the Word of God that
[52:07] neither any man that picks the name of
[52:10] common faith and shindigs and aces a
[52:13] little rock and roll and powder stuff I
[52:15] got the company food kind of picked the
[52:18] word of pot that's what's a matter with
[52:20] many of these churches today you get
[52:22] some of these little boogie-woogie Zout
[52:24] of these places out here a little old
[52:26] girl is out chin digging it doing all
[52:28] these your walk and roll over one night
[52:30] she comes over the next night you got
[52:32] her upside of the special some of you
[52:35] guys taking a move guitar players out of
[52:37] the places out there on a nightclub and
[52:40] fighting the pulpit preaching it to me
[52:41] brother I tell you you'd never do it
[52:44] here no indeed he's got the study to
[52:47] prove himself a man of God
[52:49] and fun enough we don't believe this
[52:52] your overnight jumping around like this
[52:54] that's what got the churches
[52:56] and today we need truth
[53:00] this word is true that's right if I
[53:04] handed sweet is this judgment rot must
[53:07] be a clean hand absolutely
[53:11] that judgment at hand of Moses is clean
[53:14] then the rod was put in it and the rod
[53:17] went down and drop judgments up on
[53:19] Israel and then in the wilderness is up
[53:22] beautiful - on his clothes this
[53:24] beautiful time
[53:26] when there was the rock and that rock
[53:30] block Christ and the perigee people were
[53:35] dying for water and they deserved it
[53:39] they deserved to die because they had
[53:42] murmured that complain they were not
[53:47] believers at the beginning they were
[53:50] nothing but in turn next show believers
[53:54] say that supernatural had been done and
[53:57] the multitude had went out they wasn't
[54:00] converted from their heart
[54:01] there was only three in the bunch that
[54:03] we know of Moses Aaron and Kenan
[54:07] Miriam had married him shorter tendency
[54:11] to when she left the college Moses
[54:13] married this Negro girl and said was
[54:15] there no other girls to be married and
[54:17] so forth he is gonna end table wasn't
[54:19] pleased with that and smaller with a
[54:22] leprosy and her own brother sweetened up
[54:25] and would you let your sister die and
[54:27] that she and God told Moses to come
[54:29] before you that he went and interceded
[54:31] for letter for Miriam she didn't live
[54:33] long after that no brother what God does
[54:37] is perfect we got no business with our
[54:42] minds putting anything to it just leave
[54:45] it the way it is God did it God said it
[54:48] that settles it
[54:49] just take it'll happen if I could
[54:52] explain it then I'd be equal with God
[54:54] Anup and explain and I just believe it
[54:57] huh that's all I'm afternoon there's
[55:02] nobody else to explain it because it's
[55:05] beyond our intellectual it's beyond our
[55:08] it's got another but cannot explain our
[55:13] just expected by faith and since my
[55:15] private property and I believe it I
[55:18] cannot explain how this rock lien
[55:22] they're gone had a rough that have a
[55:24] store full of water just a little rock
[55:28] for have that little bigger net dance
[55:30] but what Moses smoked this rock there
[55:35] was enough water came from it to water
[55:37] two million people in and not only that
[55:41] but as many Catalans sheets and things
[55:43] as I had with him oh when I see some of
[55:47] these artists nude pictures a little
[55:48] little drop falling out of a rock and a
[55:51] kid standing there with a bucket in his
[55:53] hand
[55:54] oh it's never come like that it's
[55:58] bountiful gushers gushing a house it's
[56:02] watered over two million people
[56:06] besides their camels and all their
[56:08] animals that rock was Christ Jesus of
[56:13] beautiful parallels of John 3:16 God so
[56:16] loved the world that He gave His only
[56:19] begotten Son and whosoever believeth in
[56:23] him should not perish but have eternal
[56:27] life
[56:28] and notice what happened it's the only
[56:31] way that they could get that water out
[56:34] of that rock that judgment rod had to
[56:37] strike the rock and Moses smoked the
[56:40] rock and God's judgment stuck upon the
[56:43] rock and when it did it gave forth its
[56:46] water the people were absolutely God was
[56:50] Justin letting them die because they had
[56:53] dips beneath him and if audible they
[56:56] were Rhetta bait they did not desert
[56:59] sand there even riff Moses Colin rebel
[57:02] resilience against God and they deserved
[57:05] that and all of us deserve death because
[57:09] we are rebellious against God even a
[57:12] wreck
[57:14] notice we all desert a guy but God is so
[57:18] merciful
[57:19] never thought of it but he's so merciful
[57:21] so he took the sins of every one of us
[57:26] and strike up all these all beloved son
[57:29] price that we might not perish but would
[57:34] have each turn of the night how could we
[57:38] drink from that rock and then he'll be
[57:41] right in our hearts but brother there's
[57:43] millions of them this morning you're
[57:45] doing it said exactly right there trust
[57:49] me because their package or Methodist or
[57:51] Pentecostal their custody because they
[57:53] had a little funny feeling because they
[57:55] spoke with tongues because they shouted
[57:57] because they danced to call they had a
[57:59] healing service of God he allistic or
[58:01] something they're trusting upon because
[58:03] they had a revelation it was true
[58:04] because they did this then things are
[58:07] all right nothing to say against that
[58:09] but that has nothing to do with your
[58:11] salvation not why pain you could put all
[58:16] out of your hands to it went to the
[58:18] gallon of blood out of your faces still
[58:20] me nothing so right Paul said I could
[58:23] speak with tongues like men and angels
[58:25] still be lost no or I could have wisdom
[58:29] and knowledge you're standing strain
[58:31] that by witnesses make it look just type
[58:33] together that's still have you got
[58:35] nothing to do with him
[58:36] brother they all drink from the same
[58:39] rock that rock was Christ the judgments
[58:43] is up on Christ that you might be
[58:44] privileged to come and drink it's God's
[58:46] goodness to you that you do come drink
[58:49] it's God's good to see you that you do
[58:51] eat from the word God's goodness even
[58:54] he's permitted you to be baptized God's
[58:57] goodness to you to make you assistance
[58:58] to give you the house to set you in the
[59:00] church this morning it's God's goodness
[59:02] that's all God's goodness but what about
[59:05] your goodness back to God are you
[59:08] willing to submit everything every spot
[59:11] ever I should ever thank you to him
[59:13] that's what that's what God has done for
[59:16] you
[59:17] what would you do for him notice let's
[59:20] just read a couple more verses now
[59:21] I'll close so the pastor can get to his
[59:23] word now look and this same
[59:26] laws Christ now the fit first but with
[59:30] many of them God was not did he see he
[59:36] permitted them to be baptized he
[59:38] permitted them to eat the word and
[59:40] believe it he permitted time to get
[59:42] spiritual blessing he prohibited them to
[59:45] drink from the spiritual rock Oh that
[59:49] God did by His grace but yet God was not
[59:52] pleased with them look par they were
[59:55] overthrown in the wilderness after all
[1:00:01] these experiences after all are great
[1:00:03] healing services we've seen after all
[1:00:06] the great miracles we see perform after
[1:00:09] all the great TVs we've had a shouting
[1:00:11] and praising God drinking from that rock
[1:00:13] all the good sermons that we have
[1:00:15] enjoyed and yet be overthrown it's all
[1:00:21] over depart from me you workers of
[1:00:23] iniquity God didn't even know yes check
[1:00:27] out we got a revival coming I know this
[1:00:33] is hard
[1:00:33] a brother and father that won't correct
[1:00:36] these sugars not a good dad right
[1:00:41] overthrow it now these things were our
[1:00:46] examples pull stinky you believe it it
[1:00:51] was an example
[1:00:53] all right to the intent that we should
[1:00:58] not lust after evil things as they also
[1:01:02] lusted good you imagine on man stands a
[1:01:08] jockey record spinner and plain old
[1:01:12] dirty rotten rolls and something
[1:01:15] happened got all shook up and all those
[1:01:17] kinds of dirty old songs that Elvis
[1:01:19] Presley and these guys play and then
[1:01:21] come back and impersonate preaching the
[1:01:24] gospel
[1:01:26] thank God could you imagine a man his
[1:01:31] woman
[1:01:31] setting out enough the woman laying out
[1:01:33] in the backyard and a little dirty
[1:01:36] have clothes on throwing herself before
[1:01:39] man and then come right back around and
[1:01:41] drink from this spiritual rock and shout
[1:01:43] and carry on there's a great doctor
[1:01:46] among the Pentecostal people's
[1:01:48] liberation of women they're wearing
[1:01:50] great long earrings and doing all kinds
[1:01:53] of dressings and a young fella stepped
[1:01:55] in front of my house a few days ago in a
[1:01:57] little truck crying that his wife
[1:01:58] Pentecostal speak with tongues gifts
[1:02:01] prophesy sure and say it all the whole
[1:02:05] church wear shorts and he she goes out
[1:02:09] on the street at eight to nine o'clock
[1:02:10] at night picking up little cigarette
[1:02:11] stumps another two stowed away and
[1:02:13] smoking and still shouting praising the
[1:02:17] Lord and given promises I stood the
[1:02:23] other day in the church or a great man
[1:02:25] of God that I have great respect far and
[1:02:28] he was exposing this after one of the
[1:02:31] man who's one of the head of it goes off
[1:02:33] and he has all this blood run now their
[1:02:37] hands and things and I've become hoarse
[1:02:39] from East from West trying to condemn
[1:02:42] that thing on the grounds of the Bible
[1:02:44] when it's not God any through thought
[1:02:48] that would come from Christ would be
[1:02:50] carful Bluffs Denny's car full of bodies
[1:02:53] here then the Second Coming is over
[1:02:55] Jesus said buddy but not when they say
[1:02:57] low aged in the desert believe it not
[1:02:58] when he sure believe it not all there'll
[1:03:00] be false christs arise and false
[1:03:02] prophets and they'll show signs and
[1:03:04] wonders in so much of this these are
[1:03:06] very elect and I've screamed it from the
[1:03:08] east to the west and fighting on the
[1:03:10] west coast but an old doctor Canada
[1:03:13] who's a bosom friend of mine stood up
[1:03:15] and another bandit with
[1:03:16] a certain man the start of this one of
[1:03:18] these movies come up there and give a
[1:03:20] great big said pure or and holy blood
[1:03:23] her blood will be shown today and they
[1:03:25] packed the place out and he sholde it
[1:03:27] out under his belt he has two needles
[1:03:31] sticking down anyone knows you can pluck
[1:03:33] this finger and it won't bleed unless
[1:03:35] you some milk it or squeeze it you stick
[1:03:37] a hole in it it won't do it the cause of
[1:03:39] AIDS or safar away from there
[1:03:40] and when he did it he's short I've done
[1:03:43] the ads a little back here ladies hands
[1:03:45] on then he come up and said see my hands
[1:03:47] perfectly normal then he said glory to
[1:03:50] God hallelujah any milk these hands down
[1:03:52] I got sure there was blood squeeze from
[1:03:54] these fingers while everybody was shot
[1:03:56] he wiped his head members across when
[1:03:58] the very man is with the man that did it
[1:04:00] there it was exposed got out there
[1:04:02] before the audience and with went in his
[1:04:05] pocket the show oils and stuff one kind
[1:04:08] of hard on the wall and said this wall
[1:04:09] is breathing the blood of Jesus that's
[1:04:11] the Heart of Jesus a big old text and
[1:04:14] walked in was the spirit said if anybody
[1:04:16] had touched that they would die they had
[1:04:17] ropes all got the pictures of it
[1:04:19] everything there for this wall with
[1:04:21] breathing blood out of a heart and this
[1:04:24] fellow walks in and slipped into the
[1:04:26] church him his wife wash the paint off
[1:04:28] of the wall and set back out there and
[1:04:30] waited to come in the pastor said well
[1:04:31] you know Jesus has been in here tuck
[1:04:33] that off he said Jesus had nothing to do
[1:04:35] with it I've done it myself right what's
[1:04:41] happened is because people are unstable
[1:04:44] Don the word of the Living God
[1:04:46] don't the Bible say they go from the
[1:04:48] east from the west and the north and the
[1:04:50] south there'd be a famine not for bread
[1:04:52] and water alone but for the hearing of
[1:04:54] the word of God what a day that we're
[1:04:58] living in and we see not all these great
[1:05:00] denominational churches are all weaken
[1:05:02] themselves together and it's got their
[1:05:04] plates that you have to bomb to this
[1:05:06] league on churches before you can even
[1:05:08] have a radio you're gone from the radio
[1:05:11] why don't you never worry about that and
[1:05:13] SMR tune all the television programs
[1:05:15] you'll have to blow to the league of
[1:05:18] churches before that you're forming
[1:05:21] nothing in the world but the mark of the
[1:05:24] beast of the Bible there you are
[1:05:28] see how it's all deep together old
[1:05:30] thanks be to God there is truly a Living
[1:05:34] God
[1:05:34] there's truly a true Lord that's truly a
[1:05:37] true word there's truly a true healing
[1:05:39] there's truly of all these things but
[1:05:42] brother don't you never base your faith
[1:05:44] up on some little sensation up on the
[1:05:46] church order you say I'm oldest brother
[1:05:52] I've taken god that may be just exactly
[1:05:54] truth or what kind of a place is that
[1:05:56] falling in that's the next thing what
[1:06:01] kind of a bucket did it come in dude
[1:06:04] Justin unjust now listen now these were
[1:06:08] examples do the piece that we should not
[1:06:11] look after evil things as they also
[1:06:14] lusted what was there last night
[1:06:17] listening won't get just a little bit
[1:06:18] part of you excuse me neither be ye
[1:06:21] idolaters or you say I thank God I'm not
[1:06:24] on my daughter wait just a minute
[1:06:27] let's examine it by the words then I
[1:06:31] would worship an idol that doesn't
[1:06:33] altogether mean you worship an idol you
[1:06:35] just have to be idle
[1:06:37] doing nothing go to church go back home
[1:06:43] do nothing about it
[1:06:44] brother real born-again matter when we
[1:06:46] can't stand they don't there's something
[1:06:49] in them they got to testify they got to
[1:06:51] do something they're bound to do
[1:06:53] something they st. holder peace listen
[1:06:56] neither the idolaters as they were some
[1:07:02] of them and it is written the people sat
[1:07:05] down to eat and drink and rose up to
[1:07:09] play let's all talk about example they
[1:07:14] were baptized into the church they
[1:07:17] absolutely had a correct baptism was
[1:07:20] three times forward backward in the name
[1:07:22] of father son holy go
[1:07:23] just only whatever it was they had a
[1:07:24] correct baptism there were baptized
[1:07:28] right we busted students already about
[1:07:31] little things like that what good does a
[1:07:34] new you're leaving off the main
[1:07:35] principle our churches is separate over
[1:07:39] back in certainly then you say well Oh
[1:07:44] hallelujah
[1:07:44] they haven't got the spiritual blessing
[1:07:46] we have there's old coal farm of glory
[1:07:47] to God I keep the real man of God on
[1:07:50] doors truth that's it back to the truth
[1:07:52] of what Gipper's does that make you say
[1:07:56] brother are the Holy Ghost really follow
[1:07:58] up in our church that's good for what
[1:08:00] difference does it make to you if you're
[1:08:03] not the right kind of a vessel it's
[1:08:05] falling in remember oh you say I'm
[1:08:10] sincere so were they they left their
[1:08:12] homes and we're not even cut their neck
[1:08:14] out for death to follow they did a lot
[1:08:18] more than what we have to do but didn't
[1:08:21] have one thing you just think the Bible
[1:08:23] said in vain do they worship me in vain
[1:08:27] do they worship Me
[1:08:29] absolutely true worship in vain where
[1:08:31] did it begin us come from the Garden of
[1:08:33] Eden Cain he worshipped God just the
[1:08:35] same as Abel did but in vain he
[1:08:37] worshiped
[1:08:39] yes sir there's the way to seemeth right
[1:08:42] from Julian you say well why is it now I
[1:08:44] believe in it why is it I'm not alright
[1:08:46] I'll repeat it I think I'm just as good
[1:08:48] as anybody else
[1:08:49] I go to church of is baptized I get the
[1:08:51] best things about I love a good sermon I
[1:08:53] love the Word of God like to read it and
[1:08:55] I get spiritual blessings to it how do I
[1:08:57] can prophesy I'm speak with tongues I've
[1:08:59] got always things give me the second
[1:09:02] beans
[1:09:02] I'm not saying something but it's
[1:09:05] possible that it could be in vain right
[1:09:09] it depends on what you are in there
[1:09:11] drying is what you are that's receiving
[1:09:14] this if you're not barn begin if there's
[1:09:19] not actually something in you then it's
[1:09:23] vain all the best things I have enough
[1:09:25] to do not just one boy neither let us
[1:09:28] commit fornication as some of them
[1:09:32] committed and fell in one day three and
[1:09:36] 20,000 commits fornication that's
[1:09:40] spiritual fornication we had time to
[1:09:44] sunny school's over spiritual
[1:09:45] fornication neither let us tempt Christ
[1:09:48] as some of them also tempted and were
[1:09:51] destroyed of serpents neither murmur ye
[1:09:56] as summer then murmured and were
[1:09:58] destroyed of the destroyer mermen lust
[1:10:05] and mix in the world with your religion
[1:10:09] going on God love purity real pure this
[1:10:17] morning I was talking about what not
[1:10:21] closing I thought this what is any
[1:10:24] sweeter in a man's life what is any
[1:10:28] sweeter than they come home when he's
[1:10:31] tired and weary with this bucket his
[1:10:33] hands from working all their plowing and
[1:10:35] whatever he might be to walk in I have a
[1:10:37] lovely wife to meet him at the door sit
[1:10:41] down on his lap a minute and brush his
[1:10:43] brow a little and kiss him on the cheek
[1:10:45] and put her arms around him and say dear
[1:10:48] I I know you're tired you've worked so
[1:10:50] hard
[1:10:51] give him consolation now that he knows
[1:10:54] that that arm is around him is
[1:10:56] absolutely his as his memories around
[1:11:02] any other man or any other desire the
[1:11:04] kiss this on his cheeks is from real
[1:11:07] pure holy heart
[1:11:09] I just love skiing and him alone how it
[1:11:13] makes you I know makes you stick your
[1:11:15] chest out show us apart after all see
[1:11:18] that's his it does something to you I
[1:11:21] want to tell you something but what if
[1:11:25] that kisses placed on his cheek and he
[1:11:27] has me confidence it might have been on
[1:11:30] some other man what about my arms around
[1:11:34] him has embraced everybody but still
[1:11:36] desiring through the same it won't mean
[1:11:39] very much there's not much help there
[1:11:41] why now in the beginning they were one
[1:11:46] God when he made man he made
[1:11:48] dual persons both male and female he
[1:11:51] separated in flesh and putting here on
[1:11:53] earth and flesh and the female part was
[1:11:55] still in spirit look friend God was so
[1:11:59] careful oh don't let it leave yeah
[1:12:05] God never got a handful of dust and may
[1:12:07] to Eve she's been a different creation
[1:12:12] and she's not a creation she's a
[1:12:14] byproduct and God goes over in the heart
[1:12:18] of Adam this rib that off hundreds heart
[1:12:20] and takes the ribbon makes a life and
[1:12:23] the very part of Adam spirit was in the
[1:12:27] woman and they too are one soul bodies
[1:12:31] spirits they are lung they are perfect
[1:12:35] oneness a real woman and a real husband
[1:12:38] the real life they are one together what
[1:12:42] is the type of price from out of these
[1:12:46] boobs and out of buy product not a
[1:12:48] Methodists or Baptists or Pentecostal
[1:12:51] hatch up no sir but he took a sweetheart
[1:12:59] that's just pure in-law college she can
[1:13:02] be she's a lot better than it look at
[1:13:06] look at their solemn and speaking
[1:13:08] combines let us walk in the tomogram let
[1:13:11] us take our fill of love and when the
[1:13:14] real believer opens his arms the pure
[1:13:16] heart it holds up to Christ that
[1:13:19] affection of that lover of Christ goes
[1:13:23] into his bosom is his wife just like the
[1:13:26] husband does to a real wife
[1:13:29] what type of person should we be are we
[1:13:32] playing the harlot with cranks are we
[1:13:35] depending on some little something and
[1:13:37] running at the world of things the world
[1:13:38] and worldly minded or not that real love
[1:13:41] and devotion that we should have could
[1:13:44] you imagine my could you imagine your
[1:13:46] wife brother tell me the setting on your
[1:13:49] lap with her little prickly frills or
[1:13:50] little under skirts and things of lace
[1:13:53] and her little hair all done up and
[1:13:54] pickled up their thing like a butter I
[1:13:56] say Oh
[1:13:57] John I just love you I love you and you
[1:13:59] know right then that there's something
[1:14:02] wrong
[1:14:03] you having a confidence in her no matter
[1:14:06] how pretty she looks and how well she's
[1:14:08] fixed you if you don't have that perfect
[1:14:11] confidence in her there's something
[1:14:13] wrong it doesn't it doesn't satisfy that
[1:14:17] longing that man would have for his wife
[1:14:20] and now I just think of yourself fooling
[1:14:22] with the world and tangling with the
[1:14:23] world in get nominees say Oh Lord Jesus
[1:14:26] I love you it's a burning Judas
[1:14:28] hypocrite yes sir I think of these
[1:14:32] things as a rebound we're coming up the
[1:14:33] hill okay
[1:14:35] oh you might have the wedding ring on
[1:14:37] that's right but you're not a wife oh
[1:14:39] you might be a woman you might be the
[1:14:42] lady of the house but you're not a wife
[1:14:44] if you act like that and you're not a
[1:14:47] readable Christian you're not a real
[1:14:50] Jenny one product for Christ if you
[1:14:53] don't love even everything that you got
[1:14:55] within you I don't care what you look
[1:14:57] pretty whether you don't you love him
[1:14:59] and you express yourself that's when you
[1:15:02] two become one
[1:15:03] that's when Christ and His Church not by
[1:15:06] denomination not by baptism not the
[1:15:08] sensations not been nothing but by real
[1:15:11] love you were bought from the bosom of
[1:15:14] God when he was wounded there and he
[1:15:17] bought you and your love and your
[1:15:19] trueness and your loyalty proves what
[1:15:22] you are see what I mean whether you all
[1:15:24] fricking up or whether you I don't care
[1:15:26] my wife wouldn't never comb her hair if
[1:15:28] she didn't wear a pretty dress or never
[1:15:31] they should be must we'd heart I had not
[1:15:34] her because her and loyalty her virtue
[1:15:36] what she is that's what she is and by
[1:15:41] Christian men and women that's what we
[1:15:44] are in the side of God it's not because
[1:15:46] if we can go to the best church and we
[1:15:48] can invest best or we can get in this
[1:15:50] neighborhood or we can do this or we can
[1:15:51] rot in this or we can do this that that
[1:15:53] doesn't have one thing to do with it
[1:15:56] it's a virtue of our loyalty and our
[1:15:59] love to Christ and that's the birth
[1:16:01] that's the thing that comes and though I
[1:16:04] speak with tongues of men and angels
[1:16:06] nothing go off beat the poor though I
[1:16:08] give my good so I do this to do that to
[1:16:10] do that I am nothing what this Christ
[1:16:13] care about what all you can do what all
[1:16:15] you can do like it if that real genuine
[1:16:17] love and all healthy isn't it
[1:16:19] think of it won't you this is Sunday
[1:16:22] school and remember that's a lesson to
[1:16:25] you be in your heart
[1:16:27] let Christ have first place like the
[1:16:30] real woman would do her husband no other
[1:16:33] arms could touch her no where no other
[1:16:35] kids no matter how charming it looks ear
[1:16:38] should turn her head she's got one step
[1:16:41] love and that's for her husband it
[1:16:42] that's right no matter how handsome the
[1:16:45] man might be in high polish to stick his
[1:16:47] heir might look and how am i holy stuff
[1:16:49] correct no sir not one thing she loves
[1:16:54] that husband let him out of known that
[1:16:57] she loves she far fits all of her
[1:17:00] virtues and all of her kisses or her
[1:17:02] Lovings and everything is to her husband
[1:17:04] and him alone do you want to mean and
[1:17:07] you Sparkle everything of the world on
[1:17:10] there how good look how pretty it looks
[1:17:12] and how fascinating it looks your virtue
[1:17:14] is what your cat about new he'll do yeah
[1:17:17] I know I got the call about this is how
[1:17:19] are you had enough kipper to fight a bus
[1:17:21] off let me tell you brother
[1:17:24] it takes virtue who the Christ respects
[1:17:26] me though I speak with tongues of men
[1:17:29] and angels though I pour forth blood out
[1:17:32] of both hands though I shout and dance
[1:17:34] in the spirit though I eat the Word of
[1:17:36] God love it though I drink from the same
[1:17:39] spiritual rock at the rest of the dough
[1:17:41] I kept my hands as loud as arrest
[1:17:43] though I have to cry crocodile tears so
[1:17:46] I can do all this but at that real
[1:17:48] genuine real Christian virtue is there
[1:17:53] to Christ you become as a sounding brass
[1:17:56] and a tinkling cymbal
[1:17:58] Paul was warning his church of this the
[1:18:00] Corinthian church where she was all
[1:18:02] mixed up in all kinds of fantastic
[1:18:04] I'm warning you friends remember I'll
[1:18:07] have to answer for you that the day of
[1:18:09] judgment and your blood won't be upon me
[1:18:11] no matter how Lord you are anything else
[1:18:13] be long
[1:18:15] to Christ remember that as we praying
[1:18:18] blessed Heavenly Father in this present
[1:18:22] estate we come now and confessing all of
[1:18:26] our wrongs Oh
[1:18:28] be thou merciful merciful God and we
[1:18:34] pray that you'll look down into our
[1:18:36] hearts and in this hour while we are

[1:18:47] the heart of the elderly women into the
[1:18:49] heart of the middle age and the young
[1:18:51] even the little children and may we
[1:18:53] examine ourselves we're coming into that
[1:18:57] holy week that we celebrate as Good

[1:19:06] loyal to church though we might have
[1:19:09] taken the communion though we might have

[1:20:15] it's whatever it may be if it's hatred
