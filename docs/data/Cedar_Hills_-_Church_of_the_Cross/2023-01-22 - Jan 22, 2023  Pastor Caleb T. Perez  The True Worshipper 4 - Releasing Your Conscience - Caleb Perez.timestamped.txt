[1:00:11] I enjoyed that
[1:00:15] once again there were three things that
[1:00:18] are needed three things that are needed
[1:00:20] in worship
[1:00:23] and you remember anybody to help me out
[1:00:25] here this morning
[1:00:26] things that are needed required for true
[1:00:30] worship
[1:00:31] somebody else
[1:00:34] a temple
[1:00:36] an altar
[1:00:39] and and a worshiper
[1:00:41] amen tell your neighbor Temple and
[1:00:44] Temple altar
[1:00:46] worshiper three things that are needed
[1:00:50] for worship
[1:00:53] God will not receive worship without
[1:00:57] these three things
[1:01:02] I'm watching you now
[1:01:05] that she means you're not going to bed
[1:01:07] early enough
[1:01:09] all right
[1:01:12] let me make sure
[1:01:23] a temple and an altar a worshiper
[1:01:28] once again God will not receive worship
[1:01:30] without these three things
[1:01:33] a temple for
[1:01:36] that's where his glory comes to
[1:01:39] Gloria it is his reference point here on
[1:01:42] Earth
[1:01:43] it is
[1:01:46] First Corinthians 6 19 says what
[1:01:53] says he say what oh
[1:01:57] no ye not
[1:01:59] that your body is the Temple of the Holy
[1:02:03] Ghost
[1:02:05] once again we need a temple this is
[1:02:15] that ye your body is the Temple of the
[1:02:19] Holy Ghost
[1:02:22] which is in you okay which we have of
[1:02:26] God and we are not your own
[1:02:33] Matthew 23 19 says
[1:02:37] fools and blind
[1:02:39] for weather is greater
[1:02:41] the gift
[1:02:43] or the altar that sanctifieth the gifts
[1:02:54] there is an altar then and the reason
[1:02:57] you we need an altar
[1:02:59] for true worship
[1:03:02] as it's the altar that sanctifieth the
[1:03:05] gift
[1:03:10] that's right amen without the altar
[1:03:13] there is no sanctifying of the gift
[1:03:17] it's the altar as he said that
[1:03:19] sanctifies it and sets it aside for
[1:03:22] service
[1:03:24] and brother Branham says your heart is
[1:03:27] the altar
[1:03:30] so now we have a temple
[1:03:33] we have a an altar
[1:03:35] Temple your body is the Temple of the
[1:03:38] Holy Ghost
[1:03:39] heart is the altar
[1:03:42] that's where God comes to and then he
[1:03:46] continues he says then around this altar
[1:03:50] the Lord healing in a greater measure
[1:03:58] okay now we got a couple of things now
[1:04:01] we're that we're hitting now we got the
[1:04:04] Temple of the Holy Ghost that we are
[1:04:07] around the altar once again measure the
[1:04:10] measure the Altar and then he says
[1:04:13] healing in a greater measure
[1:04:17] in a more higher measure
[1:04:20] in the highest plane that there is
[1:04:24] what is it
[1:04:26] Eternal healing wow
[1:04:32] eternal spirit is making
[1:04:36] Eternal creatures
[1:04:38] out of Eternal out of eat of creatures
[1:04:42] of time
[1:04:43] once again making Eternal creatures
[1:04:47] out of creatures of time
[1:04:50] then you have the worshiper
[1:04:53] and the true worshipers
[1:04:56] are the expressed attributes of God
[1:05:01] yes or yes COC once again the worshipers
[1:05:06] are the expressed attributes of God
[1:05:11] and so therefore the worshipers that are
[1:05:14] once purged
[1:05:17] should have no more conscience
[1:05:21] or desire of sin
[1:05:24] this is where we're going today you
[1:05:28] should have no more conscience of sins
[1:05:31] because the conscience has been released
[1:05:35] from a sinful nature
[1:05:37] okay here's where we're going now now
[1:05:41] three things
[1:05:48] in the Old Testament were three separate
[1:05:50] things
[1:05:52] in the new testamento three things right
[1:06:10] in order for this to be accomplished
[1:06:14] in Christ the mystery he says Mysterio
[1:06:19] Heavenly places
[1:06:21] just for a momento
[1:06:25] Heavenly places
[1:06:27] is the believer's position in Christ
[1:06:32] I want you to tell your neighbor
[1:06:35] Heavenly places
[1:06:37] is the believer's position in Christ
[1:06:43] so where the believer stands in Christ
[1:06:48] is Heavenly places
[1:06:51] if you find your position
[1:06:54] you're in Heavenly places
[1:06:57] you can't find your position
[1:07:03] or not be in Heavenly places
[1:07:06] that's impossible okay
[1:07:11] this is what happens
[1:07:14] when we set together Ephesians chapter 3
[1:07:17] and verse 8 as I build this Foundation
[1:07:22] fundamental unto me
[1:07:25] Who Am less than the least of All Saints
[1:07:28] is this Grace given
[1:07:30] that I should preach among the Gentiles
[1:07:42] The unsearchable Riches of Christ
[1:07:47] in extractiveness request as a Christian
[1:07:49] and to make all men see
[1:07:52] what is the fellowship
[1:07:54] of the Mysteries
[1:08:00] this is what we want to get to yeah The
[1:08:04] Fellowship of the mystery
[1:08:06] how many knows once again that that
[1:08:10] hello
[1:08:12] how many know
[1:08:15] that God's will in your life is a
[1:08:18] mystery Mysterio
[1:08:21] right it's a mystery it's a Mysterio
[1:08:24] it's a struggling nature trying to find
[1:08:26] out what am I doing here on Earth
[1:08:31] so we're trying to get into the The
[1:08:34] Fellowship of the Mysteries
[1:08:37] you know sometimes we have a hard time
[1:08:39] with this but we want to stay away from
[1:08:42] from brothers or sisters
[1:08:45] but but they're part of the mystery
[1:08:49] that's why when you don't feel connected
[1:08:51] what's happening
[1:08:55] I've got to get back to the fellowship
[1:08:59] because when I sit down and have
[1:09:01] fellowship with brother Emilio
[1:09:04] and I began to to talk with him I began
[1:09:08] to see the part of the mystery
[1:09:11] it's a great mystery it's been here but
[1:09:16] now it's been manifested
[1:09:19] through the members of the body of
[1:09:22] Christ
[1:09:24] how many uh how many here can say I'm I
[1:09:27] believe I'm a I'm one of the members of
[1:09:28] the body of Christ
[1:09:34] it goes beyond just talking and having a
[1:09:37] good time
[1:09:39] but if we want to get into the
[1:09:41] fellowship of it
[1:09:43] I gotta know what brother Elijah's what
[1:09:46] he's going through yes
[1:09:54] or or brother Paul
[1:09:57] I gotta know they're also struggling
[1:10:01] nature
[1:10:03] to find that Fellowship
[1:10:07] we didn't talk to each other
[1:10:09] let's find The Fellowship of the
[1:10:12] Mysteries
[1:10:14] this is a great mystery Mysterio
[1:10:18] watch this efficacy this Fellowship of
[1:10:21] the mystery is the companies which from
[1:10:24] the beginning of the world has been
[1:10:26] hidden God
[1:10:29] you've been hearing God
[1:10:32] know ye not that you are the Temple of
[1:10:35] the Holy Ghost
[1:10:38] to pour this into you
[1:10:41] but he needs a temple he needs an altar
[1:10:46] and he needs a worshiper
[1:10:48] that's why the true worshipers
[1:10:56] okay we're
[1:10:59] I caught another one another one over
[1:11:01] there yawning
[1:11:03] get your yawns out before you get to
[1:11:05] church
[1:11:08] hello everybody
[1:11:10] brother it's been a long week
[1:11:17] and sure you're gonna get this today
[1:11:24] to the intent verse 10 verses yes that
[1:11:28] now unto the principalities and powers
[1:11:31] in Heavenly places
[1:11:38] might be known
[1:11:40] by the church
[1:11:43] oh I I like this now because it's got to
[1:11:47] be known by the church
[1:11:50] Fellowship of the Mysteries
[1:11:54] known by the church the manifold wisdom
[1:11:57] of God
[1:12:01] now you all said you want to know right
[1:12:04] I want to know what the mystery is
[1:12:07] Will in your life
[1:12:09] it's for the church
[1:12:12] watch in verse 11 according to the
[1:12:15] Eternal purpose
[1:12:30] that's because we come to the same
[1:12:33] church
[1:12:35] yes or yes COC that doesn't equal
[1:12:38] automatically equal if we go to the
[1:12:40] church
[1:12:42] wonderful no the devil came to church
[1:12:45] this morning
[1:12:46] you know the spirit of antichrist is
[1:12:49] moving along in the audience too
[1:12:52] in whom we have boldness now
[1:12:56] Hallelujah
[1:13:53] [Music]
[1:14:16] the Bible says let us therefore come
[1:14:19] boldly Before the Throne
[1:14:22] he wants us to have boldness
[1:14:25] and accessor
[1:14:29] oh yeah access

[1:15:41] with confidence by the faith of him
[1:15:47] we'll start then to re to to reach New
[1:15:50] Heights
[1:15:52] what could a church accomplish Iglesia
[1:15:57] I saw a lot of things being accomplished
[1:15:59] this week
[1:16:01] what was going on we were getting into
[1:16:05] the Fellowship of the Mysteries
[1:16:09] what could a church do for God
[1:16:12] if we could get into this place with him
[1:16:16] The Fellowship of the Mysteries
[1:16:20] that's where we'll get into the perfect
[1:16:24] worship
[1:16:26] when the body begins to come together
[1:16:30] unite together
[1:16:32] my goodness
[1:16:36] when this worshiper
[1:16:37] comes together with this worship
[1:16:40] together with these words
[1:16:42] That's what Satan fears
[1:16:45] it's the unity don't let nothing take it
[1:16:49] away from you
[1:16:51] I'm in disagreement with a lot of things
[1:16:53] that's okay
[1:16:56] take you out of the Fellowship of the
[1:16:58] Mysteries
[1:17:00] and you find yourself cold and
[1:17:03] indifference
[1:17:11] Ephesians 1 3 blessed be the God and
[1:17:14] father of our Lord Jesus Christ
[1:17:21] who have blessed us
[1:17:25] with all spiritual blessings in Heavenly
[1:17:28] places in Christ Jesus
[1:17:33] the angels of God are with us
[1:17:40] spiritual blessings to us
[1:17:44] spirituales yes or yes COC uh I don't
[1:17:48] see him I don't feel him huh they're
[1:17:50] here you're not available
[1:17:54] but they're not here just to pass some
[1:17:56] time
[1:17:57] the Bible says here watch watch this is
[1:18:01] the prophet in the infallibility of
[1:18:02] God's spoken word
[1:18:05] the angels of God are with us
[1:18:09] to minister spiritual blessings
[1:18:14] to help us along the road
[1:18:17] and encourage us
[1:18:21] as we see the hill of Zion Yonder in
[1:18:26] sight now
[1:18:28] he says the reason we don't have
[1:18:31] spiritual blessings
[1:18:33] I have too much time to watch television
[1:18:39] his wonders to perform
[1:18:42] too much time to read the newspapers
[1:18:46] or listening to something that we ought
[1:18:49] not to listen to is
[1:18:54] yeah
[1:18:55] listening to a lot of stuff we don't
[1:18:57] need to be listening
[1:19:00] and we are not Redeeming the time
[1:19:04] for giving it to the things of the world
[1:19:08] instead of our time to the Lord Jesus
[1:19:12] Christ that's the air that we make
[1:19:17] we release our conscience
[1:19:24] is
[1:19:43] money cars houses
[1:19:48] Lord's really blessing me I can go on
[1:19:51] vacation
[1:19:52] God bless you and those things
[1:19:56] spiritual blessings
[1:20:01] oh the blessings that we look for now
[1:20:05] they have a car why can't I get it
[1:20:12] what does it have to do with the
[1:20:14] Fellowship of the Mysteries
[1:20:18] we're releasing the conscience to the
[1:20:21] wrong things
[1:20:23] this is God's desire for his church
[1:20:28] this is my desire as a pastor
[1:20:32] my question is can we reach this level
[1:20:38] I'll do all that I can church
[1:20:41] but I need each one of you to to do all
[1:20:43] that you can too
[1:20:46] lord gave me this and as I was reading I
[1:20:49] said oh Lord
[1:20:52] and say Lord can we ever get there
[1:20:56] when I pick up the phone or I sit down
[1:21:00] to talk with somebody
[1:21:03] then that's all I hear is this one
[1:21:06] doesn't like this one this person
[1:21:09] doesn't get along with that one is
[1:21:12] going to sit in my study and cry you
[1:21:14] know
[1:21:16] how will we ever get there
[1:21:22] opening my heart to you as a pastor
[1:21:25] and we ever get there
[1:21:32] our Spirits watch releasing the
[1:21:34] conscience
[1:21:35] conscience is in the spirit right
[1:21:38] this is adoption number one on the
[1:21:42] screen
[1:21:43] now our Spirits
[1:21:45] has brought us into it Heavenly
[1:21:50] atmosphere
[1:21:52] oh brother
[1:21:55] Heavenly atmosphere celestial
[1:22:00] problem is it's not always a Heavenly
[1:22:02] atmosphere celestial
[1:22:06] oh what could happen
[1:22:10] it's a question
[1:22:12] what could happen tonight
[1:22:16] if we would be sitting here in Heavenly
[1:22:20] places they're in a Heavenly atmosphere
[1:22:23] and the Holy Spirit moving over every
[1:22:27] heart
[1:22:29] that's been regenerated
[1:22:32] and become a new creature in Christ
[1:22:35] Jesus Christ
[1:22:38] all sins under the blood
[1:22:42] all sins
[1:22:44] but you don't know what what they did to
[1:22:46] me
[1:22:49] come on now
[1:22:52] when will we get to the place where we
[1:22:54] can see each other through the blood
[1:22:59] of the blood
[1:23:01] look at you
[1:23:03] all I see is the blood
[1:23:06] because if I am the Temple of the Holy
[1:23:09] Ghost
[1:23:11] then when God looks at the Earth
[1:23:14] all he sees is the blood of his son
[1:23:17] going around
[1:23:19] then why are we trying to get out get
[1:23:22] under the blood and see what's going on
[1:23:29] in perfect worship
[1:23:32] with our hands up to God
[1:23:35] your heart's lifted
[1:23:38] in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus

[1:31:07] that's why you gotta sigh and cry for
[1:31:10] the Abomination
[1:31:11] you'll desire this church
[1:31:14] you can't just want it you gotta desire
[1:31:17] it is
[1:31:21] everybody's speaking in love and harmony
[1:31:25] everybody in One Accord in one place
[1:31:34] suddenly there came from heaven
[1:31:38] like a Russian Mighty Wind he said there
[1:31:44] you are he has blessed us with all
[1:31:47] spiritual blessings
[1:31:50] that's the believer's position in Christ
[1:31:55] the believer can all listen closely the
[1:31:59] believer can only worship Christ
[1:32:05] in Christ
[1:32:07] minuto
[1:32:11] you think just sitting here in church
[1:32:13] you're in Heavenly places
[1:32:17] no no you can sit here and be stuck to
[1:32:20] the Earth where the status
[1:32:23] but how many want to go to Heavenly
[1:32:25] places
[1:32:26] why don't we desire it every time we
[1:32:29] come
[1:32:30] why are we not an expectation every time
[1:32:36] why do we have to wait for a week-long
[1:32:38] service foreign
[1:32:45] it's got to be a constantly everyday
[1:32:47] thing
[1:32:51] you don't listen closely
[1:32:54] you cannot Worship the Lord
[1:32:57] just because you came to church
[1:33:05] oh I went and well I really Worship the
[1:33:07] Lord
[1:33:09] never found your place in Christ
[1:33:12] he will not accept that word
[1:33:18] come on Checkers I I gotta check myself
[1:33:25] I said Lord I want true I want to be a
[1:33:29] true worshiper
[1:33:35] the believer can only worship Christ
[1:33:39] as he is now
[1:33:56] brother Brown stops and says
[1:33:58] I don't believe you get it this is
[1:34:06] I don't believe you get it
[1:34:12] watch him now all right
[1:34:15] let me go
[1:34:17] another route it is
[1:34:22] going there
[1:34:25] wow
[1:34:26] look
[1:34:28] and then he says look why does he say a
[1:34:31] meeting this is the believer's position
[1:34:32] in Christ
[1:34:35] I'm gonna go another route we're not
[1:34:38] getting anything
[1:34:39] a believer
[1:34:42] cannot worship
[1:34:45] and has no right to worship
[1:34:50] not just not only can you not worship
[1:34:53] but you don't even have a right to work
[1:34:57] no man has no right to Worship the Lord
[1:35:02] your side of being in the body of the
[1:35:06] Lord Jesus Christ
[1:35:08] did you know that
[1:35:13] oh
[1:35:18] as we think because we raise our hands
[1:35:21] and we sing a few songs we're worshiping
[1:35:22] the Lord
[1:35:27] he said Cain was a worshiper
[1:35:37] where do we pick up these ideas
[1:35:39] we can live any kind of life and come
[1:35:41] raise our hands in church and
[1:35:43] everything's cool
[1:35:46] no right to even worship Him
[1:35:50] by one Spirit
[1:35:52] coming to the body
[1:35:55] baptized into the body
[1:35:57] but then you have a right to begin to
[1:36:01] finally worship
[1:36:03] that's what he's telling the woman at
[1:36:06] the well
[1:36:07] you worship ye no not what you were says
[1:36:12] no right to worship unless you come into
[1:36:15] this body
[1:36:17] outside of your position there is no
[1:36:20] true worship
[1:36:22] why okay because outside of the body but
[1:36:26] you're always fighting against the
[1:36:28] people that are in the body
[1:36:33] and if they're in the body but worship
[1:36:37] is in here
[1:36:38] you're fighting against them
[1:36:41] they're actually fighting against him
[1:36:45] come on now people are fighting against
[1:36:47] Christ
[1:36:50] his worship is in her
[1:36:56] when we find our place our position
[1:36:59] even one worshiper you begins to unite
[1:37:01] with another worship
[1:37:04] oh my now we're on to something
[1:37:07] now The Fellowship of the Mysteries
[1:37:13] that's the trouble
[1:37:15] we shouldn't be broke up in
[1:37:17] organizations and denominations
[1:37:20] we should be Sons and Daughters of God
[1:37:25] holding the great galaxy of the world
[1:37:28] together
[1:37:33] you want a purpose in life
[1:37:35] you want God's perfect will get in love
[1:37:38] perfect
[1:37:41] what a purpose you should be Sons and
[1:37:44] Daughters
[1:37:45] taking the great galaxy of the world
[1:37:47] together
[1:37:55] but there's so much unbelief
[1:38:00] that keeps us apart
[1:38:07] foreign
[1:38:47] but then pero luego and realize our
[1:38:51] conscience has to be released is that is

[1:40:51] brother Branham I don't know there's so
[1:40:53] many mistakes and errors in the message

[1:43:02] name
[1:43:03] confess it from your mouth
[1:43:06] conscience is released

[1:43:14] oh Church yeah this is the key church
[1:43:18] he says when I make by faith my
[1:43:21] Confessions
[1:43:23] by his stripes Caleb paris's heels
[1:43:26] versus
[1:43:30] Caleb Pettis is restored caliper is
[1:43:37] perfected is perfect
[1:43:40] releasing my conscience to these things
[1:43:45] watch what he says here I think he said
[1:43:48] okay and when I release it
[1:43:50] that's scripture
[1:43:53] becomes alive to me
[1:43:58] that's why the message seems dead to a
[1:44:00] lot of people foreign
[1:44:43] hey what a thing that is
[1:44:45] though to wash one another's feet
[1:44:49] on your family's feet
[1:44:53] when you begin to unite on another level
[1:44:59] it's not Palace that unites the baddest
[1:45:02] family
[1:45:03] a lot of Jesus Christ
[1:45:07] to unite his family
[1:45:11] gotta throw away all this nonsense
[1:45:13] sometimes
[1:45:16] yeah in a church yeah
[1:45:19] I understand God uses families don't get
[1:45:22] me wrong
[1:45:23] for a specific purpose
[1:45:26] that don't make me any better than any
[1:45:28] of you
[1:45:30] must be better or higher because I'm the
[1:45:32] pastor and nada
[1:45:35] come on Church they don't make me any
[1:45:38] better than you
[1:45:40] well you didn't like that or what no
[1:45:42] let's go Stone
[1:45:48] we always like to elevate people right
[1:45:52] and then something goes wrong and then
[1:45:54] it's like
[1:45:56] I thought I believed
[1:46:02] you can go to hell believing in the mess
[1:46:06] you by Revelation
[1:46:09] who the man is
[1:46:11] that has placed the man in the office
[1:46:22] don't ever try to make brother Caleb
[1:46:24] something that he's not
[1:46:27] we don't believe in all this junk that
[1:46:29] goes around
[1:46:31] eight Messengers and 15th Messengers
[1:46:39] there is a respect yes
[1:46:45] respect the man that's there too I
[1:46:47] understand that
[1:46:48] remember when it's all said and done
[1:46:51] the body of Christ
[1:46:57] I'm gonna tell you what I believe
[1:47:00] something else
[1:47:59] we can do away with a man and have
[1:48:01] enough entrance
[1:48:15] what happens
[1:48:18] and then
[1:48:19] sometimes somebody in the church
[1:48:21] do you have a little authority over
[1:48:23] someone
[1:48:25] no no
[1:48:51] this is what I've stood foreign
[1:49:14] amen
[1:49:16] we're gonna clean a little house
[1:49:19] there's a bunch of nonsense that goes on
[1:49:21] in the church
[1:49:23] we will fulfill that adoption I
[1:49:27] completely
[1:49:30] you want to be part of it I welcome you
[1:49:34] into the mystery
[1:49:37] The Fellowship of the mystery oh my
[1:49:40] barely getting going
[1:49:42] so don't try to stop
[1:49:45] you need to leave God bless you there's
[1:49:47] there's the door
[1:50:02] but we were after something this morning
[1:50:09] do you love me I love you too and I
[1:50:13] wouldn't
[1:50:14] talk like this if I didn't enough
[1:50:17] but it's time we release
[1:50:23] so many ideas
[1:50:31] you ready for the next part yeah
[1:50:36] watch this
[1:50:38] I mentioned something in the panel on
[1:50:40] Thursdays
[1:50:42] [Music]
[1:50:44] and I want to reiterate this because
[1:50:46] it's very helpful listen closely okay
[1:50:48] and it will help you so I talked about
[1:50:52] that remember that the man that was
[1:50:53] given a book of brother Branham
[1:50:56] I don't want this no more
[1:50:59] this band all he called me was a buzzard
[1:51:01] or Crow or whatever
[1:51:04] the man was like
[1:51:09] oh he calls me is an eagle everywhere I
[1:51:11] read
[1:51:15] what's the difference
[1:51:17] one man one man's conscience
[1:51:20] was released to the message
[1:51:23] and the other one hadn't been released
[1:51:29] we're gonna go listen closely because
[1:51:31] this is gonna this is gonna snowball now
[1:51:34] watch this now watch the releasing of
[1:51:36] the conscience
[1:51:38] how do you find God's perfect will in
[1:51:40] your life
[1:51:43] are you waiting for the
[1:51:45] aha moment
[1:51:52] the Revelation is an aha moment
[1:51:56] but but let's find out how this aha
[1:51:59] moment comes
[1:52:01] God's will in your life is a mystery
[1:52:06] and without the mystery we cannot be a
[1:52:08] true worshiper I'm not all here because
[1:52:11] that's what our desire is
[1:52:13] a true worshipers
[1:52:15] watch this
[1:52:18] you worship
[1:52:20] you know not what
[1:52:22] acts 17 we're going to go to this
[1:52:25] scripture and then we'll we'll see as
[1:52:27] this as this unfolds now
[1:52:29] this is Paul verse 22 he's standing on
[1:52:33] Mars Hill he's telling that you're too
[1:52:36] superstitious
[1:52:39] way a lot of people see the Rapture very
[1:52:41] superstitious
[1:52:45] driving in my car
[1:52:48] you're too superstitious
[1:52:52] your conscience has been released to a
[1:52:54] denominational idea
[1:52:57] denominational
[1:52:59] Church get this message today hear it
[1:53:02] again this is where the Lord is going to
[1:53:04] come and bring it all together
[1:53:07] I passed
[1:53:09] verse 23. as I pass by and
[1:53:13] I beheld your devotions
[1:53:16] oh I love the Lord I love the message I
[1:53:19] love oh we got to bring it to us right
[1:53:23] and amidst all your devotions
[1:53:26] I found an altar in control
[1:53:30] what is the altar okay come on what is
[1:53:33] the altar your heart I found a heart
[1:53:39] and in this inscriptions
[1:53:43] to the unknown God
[1:53:49] I see a lot of Hearts today wherever I
[1:53:51] go
[1:53:53] and it's got that inscription
[1:53:56] to the unknown God
[1:54:00] you don't automatically know him
[1:54:03] just because you go to church
[1:54:07] not even Cedar Hills
[1:54:10] but I believe in Cedar Hills and Cedar
[1:54:13] Hills there's a portal portal
[1:54:20] and you have it in your heart
[1:54:22] to the unknown God
[1:54:25] because if you're not in the body you
[1:54:28] can even worship him
[1:54:31] therefore ye ignorantly worship
[1:54:39] raising your hands but if you're not in
[1:54:43] the body it doesn't receive the worship
[1:54:47] you have a form of godliness
[1:54:55] why because you don't spend your time
[1:54:58] trying to get to know the grooms
[1:55:06] oh my my entire neighbor neighbor we're
[1:55:10] in for good and right now
[1:55:11] what a ride we're going on come on now
[1:55:15] this is why we don't do it
[1:55:17] we ignorantly worship
[1:55:21] but Paul says
[1:55:24] I declare it unto you
[1:55:27] I'm going to declare to you
[1:55:30] the mystery El Mysterio
[1:55:38] okay come on now Revelations 10 7 and 8.
[1:55:43] Holy Ghost is putting it together for
[1:55:45] you today
[1:55:47] that's all read it together
[1:55:49] but in the days of the voice of the
[1:55:53] seventh angel when he shall begin to
[1:55:56] sound the mystery of God should be
[1:55:59] finished as he hath declared it to his
[1:56:02] servants the prophets how many believe
[1:56:05] that
[1:56:08] well I don't believe that's brother
[1:56:09] Branham your conscience hasn't been
[1:56:12] released
[1:56:15] I don't believe that's him your
[1:56:18] conscience hasn't been released simply
[1:56:23] that's right that's right so since you
[1:56:26] got a good idea who is it
[1:56:32] got a better idea than God what's your
[1:56:34] idea
[1:56:35] let me see yeah what you have released
[1:56:38] your conscience too
[1:56:40] well in YouTube and YouTube this man
[1:56:45] said this is
[1:56:47] you would be
[1:57:00] that's right
[1:57:03] oh if I've ever felt the presence of the
[1:57:06] Lord it's right now
[1:57:08] let him come and have total control of
[1:57:12] his service it's right now
[1:57:15] oh so much as he walking through the
[1:57:18] through this through this church right
[1:57:20] now
[1:57:21] whatever you would ask for it is
[1:57:30] all right
[1:57:31] yes
[1:57:33] anybody want receiving anything
[1:57:36] okay we'll stand to your feet for a
[1:57:39] moment whatever you're asking for looks
[1:57:41] for a moment your feet how do you say in
[1:57:43] Jesus name
[1:57:46] it's here to meet you
[1:57:49] he wants a release of the conscience
[1:57:57] release your conscience to him
[1:58:00] days of the voice of the seventh Angels
[1:58:04] he would begin to sound the mystery of
[1:58:09] God will be finished
[1:58:13] and Christ is the mystery of God reveals
[1:58:17] when you come into his body
[1:58:20] you're coming into the mystery of the
[1:58:23] fellowships
[1:58:26] you may be seated
[1:58:28] you just believe it
[1:58:30] put your my hands on you all the time
[1:58:32] that's okay
[1:58:35] there's time for that church there's
[1:58:37] time for all this that's okay there are
[1:58:41] people that need that
[1:58:42] grow a little bit
[1:58:45] every time you came through those doors
[1:58:54] that's real perfect worship
[1:58:59] and the voice which I heard from heaven
[1:59:05] instead go and take the little book yes
[1:59:08] which is open in the hand of the Angels
[1:59:13] but the problem is we want to just
[1:59:15] release our conscience to certain things
[1:59:20] I don't want to release my conscience
[1:59:25] we have a message
[1:59:28] that's what we were doing on Thursday
[1:59:31] was bringing a balance
[1:59:34] there's a balancing there is a Ministry
[1:59:37] of tapes to take the tapes
[1:59:44] my conscience is just released to that
[1:59:47] portion
[1:59:49] still I'm Gonna Miss This other portion
[1:59:54] of the books
[1:59:59] I want it open to all the messages
[2:00:08] are you are you getting it this morning
[2:00:10] do I have to go another route
[2:00:18] Christ is the anointed word of the hour
[2:00:24] and it should never be to the unknown
[2:00:25] God anymore
[2:00:43] was the seventh angel
[2:00:46] just revealing the mystery of marriage
[2:00:49] and divorce Mysterio
[2:00:53] was the seventh angel just
[2:00:55] revealing the mystery of the blindness
[2:00:57] of Israel
[2:01:03] sure those Mysteries were revealed
[2:01:06] but let me ask you this question
[2:01:12] people might ask why we have a picture
[2:01:18] just because we believe he's a prophet
[2:01:21] no no because he is a Vindicated prophet
[2:01:26] and the same Jesus Jesus that came forth
[2:01:31] which was the very Tabernacle of God
[2:01:34] he went back to his original condition
[2:01:38] or his original which was the pillar of
[2:01:40] fire that's foreign
[2:01:46] come on Church don't you see the same
[2:01:49] one no es el mismo or are you blind come

[2:02:19] your conscience to the revelation of the
[2:02:22] words
[2:02:27] came to bring a message from God
[2:02:30] that would reveal the very mystery as
[2:02:33] well
[2:02:35] yes he brought all those things
[2:02:38] but without releasing your conscience
[2:02:41] all we become is a bunch of theologians
[2:02:45] in the message
[2:02:47] and a theologian cannot give life to
[2:02:50] anyone
[2:02:52] oh we we know a lot huh we're going to
[2:02:56] be responsible for Allah
[2:02:59] conscience is released

[2:03:05] the whole message
[2:03:11] I can't help but give lives
[2:03:17] it's okay to become a theologian as well
[2:03:22] but answer the mystery first Mysterio

[2:03:45] and that you have come into the
[2:03:47] fellowship

[2:03:52] and then if you want to become a
[2:03:54] theologian go for it
[2:03:59] a son and daughter of God first

[2:10:02] we know everybody in the church yeah
[2:10:07] because everybody most I shouldn't say

[2:10:51] I don't think so no Creo
[2:10:56] is it wrong to do this oh I love the way
[2:11:00] our founding Pastor asked that
[2:11:04] is
[2:11:08] wrong he said to go to Disneyland yes
[2:11:14] and those that love Disney hope yes
[2:11:28] like if Disney saved you or something
[2:11:31] but then he comes and brings a balance
[2:11:35] he said but he said answer the sin
[2:11:39] question
[2:11:40] there's nothing wrong with it
[2:11:43] because it's not the Disneyland that
[2:11:45] brings joy to you it is almighty God
[2:11:48] that comes in the power of His words
[2:11:54] they say is it wrong to play basketball
[2:11:56] yes it is CCS

[2:12:17] those spirits
[2:12:19] that atmosphere will suck you in it

[2:12:42] Amigos oh they'll make you love things
[2:12:44] out there
[2:12:45] my question now I'm gonna flip it on you
[2:12:48] did you get him to love the Lord
[2:12:53] that's the question
[2:12:59] hello everybody
[2:13:01] I like this
[2:13:04] we're not even close to being done right
[2:13:06] now
[2:13:12] foreign
[2:13:23] we know Church
[2:13:24] we know religion
[2:13:27] failures
[2:13:29] we know what everyone's doing
[2:13:32] but ask them about the groom
[2:13:36] um
[2:13:40] exactly exacto
[2:13:43] and you love someone so much
[2:13:45] you didn't even care what anybody says
[2:13:47] or things
[2:13:49] I fell in love with my wife and I was
[2:13:51] like yeah okay whatever
[2:13:54] right right come on yeah
[2:13:58] why don't we fall in love with God
[2:14:02] watch this now when I read the
[2:14:04] scriptures I read the message I'm
[2:14:07] finding out answers to my Mysteries
[2:14:13] there are those that read the message to
[2:14:15] find mistakes
[2:14:17] when they tell me that the message is
[2:14:20] wrong
[2:14:21] I say impossible
[2:14:26] worry
[2:14:29] come on let's challenge him today
[2:14:32] the message is wrong
[2:14:35] and I found the answer is
[2:14:45] what he was sent to do
[2:14:47] for the faith to return us back
[2:14:52] and who we originally are hello
[2:14:58] don't make it complicated what he came
[2:15:02] to do
[2:15:02] you know why silent okay because one day
[2:15:05] years ago
[2:15:07] I released my country
[2:15:12] I released it to Malachi foreign
[2:15:35] and when you answer the same questions
[2:15:47] release your conscience to every word
[2:15:51] you remember now when I was talking
[2:15:54] about this
[2:15:55] I have a quote
[2:15:58] wonderful hermoso
[2:16:01] but you better have more than a quote
[2:16:04] the conscience to the whole message
[2:16:11] we have released
[2:16:15] and I ask you what have you released
[2:16:16] your conscience to this
[2:16:19] you want to find errors in the church
[2:16:25] and and here's a here's the news flash
[2:16:29] humans in here we make mistakes but
[2:16:34] please look at each other through the
[2:16:35] blood
[2:16:39] talk about the church to anyone else
[2:16:44] at least your conscience to those things
[2:16:47] like that
[2:16:50] amen
[2:16:53] you want me to stop I'll stop
[2:16:57] I'm officially halfway through
[2:17:08] now I'm going to put this in a way
[2:17:12] let me put it like this
[2:17:14] in a church yeah for a while you get a
[2:17:18] lot of ministers
[2:17:21] and sometimes the minister is waiting
[2:17:23] for
[2:17:24] the next time he gets to preachers
[2:17:30] They Don't Preach for a while
[2:17:34] I like the way things are going in that
[2:17:35] church Iglesia
[2:17:40] something's wrong
[2:17:46] you're not a preacher or Minister
[2:17:48] because you get behind this sacred dance
[2:17:52] your number one thing is that the
[2:17:55] minister is to take the gospel around
[2:17:57] the world
[2:18:01] yeah
[2:18:03] my brother told me it says brother
[2:18:07] hermano I believe
[2:18:09] brother Branham says that
[2:18:13] the United States needs more
[2:18:15] missionaries than anyone else
[2:18:19] and so I'm now I don't care about going
[2:18:21] anywhere else
[2:18:24] I only want to preach to my neighbors
[2:18:25] and anyone I come in contact
[2:18:29] and I said God bless you for that
[2:18:31] brother
[2:18:36] if that's what his conscience was
[2:18:37] released
[2:18:40] but I said but if he called you to
[2:18:44] testify to your neighbor
[2:18:46] and to go around the world
[2:18:50] don't knock somebody that goes to
[2:18:52] another country
[2:18:54] what's the balance now it's easy to get
[2:18:58] one thing and say oh yeah but we don't
[2:19:00] need this we just need the missionaries
[2:19:01] right yeah we do it's possible
[2:19:03] we should all be missionaries
[2:19:07] don't throw at somebody that goes
[2:19:09] somewhere where God's pulling him
[2:19:13] to a punch line at the end
[2:19:20] well I I'm only a housewife brother
[2:19:23] might result
[2:19:25] that you would put the word only in
[2:19:28] front of that
