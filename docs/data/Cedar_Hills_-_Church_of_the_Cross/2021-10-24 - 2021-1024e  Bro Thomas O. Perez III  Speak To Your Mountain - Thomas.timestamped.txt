[20:57] being up here the
[21:00] the power is that's a little girl
[21:03] uncle tommy
[21:05] a little story i'll share
[21:08] i told my granny
[21:10] man i just want to get up and sing a
[21:12] special
[21:13] i can't wait
[21:14] please just put in a thing
[21:19] and so she goes are you sure are you
[21:20] sure
[21:21] well yeah i'm sure i want to
[21:24] so then when i get up
[21:27] this the spirit of the lord up here is
[21:29] just so strong
[21:31] that i couldn't i couldn't contain it
[21:34] i just kept wrapping the cord around my
[21:36] hand
[21:37] i started crying
[21:40] and then
[21:42] i just thank the lord for the elders
[21:45] the ministry
[21:47] for everyone that even if you don't know
[21:50] when
[21:50] you're out there on the streets
[21:53] fighting and battling
[21:55] you may not know that someone will see
[21:57] you
[21:59] and you're their light
[22:01] there's a day
[22:02] where the demons were attacking me
[22:05] and justine
[22:07] sister jen she didn't even know she
[22:09] thought that i saw her
[22:11] but just the light seeing her
[22:14] just made me feel so good inside
[22:17] and just
[22:18] to the kids
[22:20] i can't tell you what enough how much
[22:23] i've been battling even one of my own
[22:25] kids explaining
[22:27] to them
[22:28] that there's kids out there that don't
[22:30] even have
[22:31] legs at work
[22:33] eyes that work
[22:34] so the little things we take for granted
[22:38] we don't realize every day
[22:40] but i just want to thank the lord for
[22:43] all the elders all the ministers
[22:46] everyone that fights the fight
[22:49] even though you don't know when we're
[22:51] out there
[22:52] the devil thinks that he got this but
[22:54] greater is he that is in us
[22:57] and i'm going to start
[23:00] letting those little voices convince me
[23:04] or try to feed that black dog like

[23:08] you that you're feeling the most
[23:11] the white one or the black one
[23:13] so i just wanted to thank the lord for
[23:17] my my elders because there's times where

[23:20] grandmother and the life she lives
[23:23] there's not a price that i can put over
[23:25] how much i'm grateful
[23:27] so i just wanted to thank her
[23:30] and all the elders
[23:31] and just let the kids know
[23:33] it's no dope when you go out there on
[23:35] the street
[23:36] because you think you know what the
[23:38] demons are until you're facing them
[23:40] you don't know
[23:41] so thank the lord
[23:43] for your elders and the message that he

[33:28] sick and he raised the dead

[35:00] [Music]
[35:02] god
[35:03] can't do anything
[35:06] oh my god
[35:09] can't do anything
[35:12] or he's got the power
[35:15] [Music]
[35:21] oh
[35:36] it makes no difference
[35:45] is
[35:47] [Music]
[35:54] [Music]
[36:05] oh
[36:20] [Music]
[36:23] oh he's got the power
[36:32] [Music]
[36:38] anything
[36:43] amen how many believe that tonight
[36:47] can your god do anything
[36:50] i believe i believe tonight
[36:52] that
[37:20] and it says see
[37:24] and it says for
[37:25] for verily i say unto you
[37:29] that whosoever
[37:33] it doesn't just say the prophet
[37:37] it doesn't just say the pastor
[37:40] pastor it doesn't just say anybody
[37:47] onto this mountain
[38:01] how many have obstacles in your life
[38:05] how many have gone through obstacles in
[38:07] their life
[38:10] and sometimes
[38:12] it feels like the mountain is unmovable
[38:44] oh
[38:58] it becomes our bills
[39:02] all of a sudden life gets in the way
[39:07] all of a sudden we start messing around
[39:09] a little bit
[39:25] and then we start believing the word of
[39:27] the devil
[39:31] diablo
[39:33] see you ain't got what you think you got
[39:40] but
[42:01] much is lost as they say
[42:03] not a big deal no no no
[42:08] when you are a big deal
[42:12] you're a son and daughter of god
[42:58] that stood up with michaels
[43:02] and though they were outnumbered
[43:07] they could spread to the mountains
[43:23] is because everybody wants to be in
[43:25] charge
[43:30] of everybody else's mountains
[43:36] here was lucifer
[43:38] and the bible tells you
[43:41] that this guy que este hombre he could
[43:44] sing better than anybody else
[43:51] he could sing in his worship to the lord
[43:57] was incredible
[44:00] but one day
[44:02] there was a problem found in him
[45:02] the mountains except for their blood and
[45:05] content
[45:06] every morning
[45:14] the scripture tells us
[45:28] he doesn't say that you have to have
[45:30] this big huge face
[45:35] you could just have the faith of a
[45:36] mustard seed
[45:42] which is about the size of a grain of
[45:44] sand
[46:12] we think it
[46:26] is there anything too hard for our god
[46:34] is there anything i i'll go
[46:36] have you found something that's greater
[46:38] than our god
[46:49] [Music]
[46:54] way
[46:57] like give me a blanket
[47:01] i'm only up here for a few more minutes
[47:05] but i want you to get this
[47:23] he said lord senor if that be you see it
[47:27] is still then bid me to come with you
[47:33] you're not talking about walking on
[47:34] ground
[47:46] where there was the sea and there was
[47:48] nothing to there was no rock system
[49:14] is
[49:17] he began to see his inadequacies
[49:24] and he began to sink
[49:28] but peter
[49:40] he can pick me up
[49:56] he didn't see the waves anymore
[50:00] because he could say to the waves
[50:09] and god
[50:10] come
[50:24] because the bible
[51:19] that nobody cared about it
[51:23] you might say us
[51:25] how do you know that
[51:28] because my cousin carlos
[51:31] carlos nobody wanted him
[51:34] but one
[51:45] you see a man full of success
[52:14] and i just i
[52:16] i'm just like only god could do that for
[52:18] you carlos
[52:22] what a great god we serve
[52:26] we come to this a lot of times
[52:30] jealousy cellos becomes a dangerous
[52:33] thing
[52:36] so what happens a lot of times
[52:40] so i see my brother
[52:44] he has success
[52:54] and then we act like there's no promises
[52:56] coming to us
[53:21] it's not us to say oh how come he got
[53:24] something and i did it
[53:52] is
[54:23] sense no nothing uncertain you gotta
[54:25] give god the praise
[54:28] you've got to give him the glory
[54:31] you gotta give him the honor
[54:34] because my god
[55:04] with men
[55:18] abraham when hermano avraham gave you
[55:21] young people a big key lesbian
[55:25] he wakes up in the morning
[55:28] first thing he does la primera costa que
[55:30] la say praise
[55:44] you have nothing to worry about
[56:01] i got the great opportunity of going to
[56:03] hawaii
[56:06] hawaii aloha from hawaii aloha to hawaii
[56:13] so we were there
[56:16] and last year during the pandemic

[56:44] sister amber garcia
[56:48] amber garcia and he said let's go to

[56:54] we can go tengo una manera
[57:09] we feel that our sacrifice towards god
[57:15] or what we go through
[57:18] that it doesn't matter
[57:23] sometimes
