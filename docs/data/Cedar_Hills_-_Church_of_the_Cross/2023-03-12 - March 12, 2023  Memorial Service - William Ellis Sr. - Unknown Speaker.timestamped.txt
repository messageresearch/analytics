[45:10] Holy Spirit
[45:12] precious name of Jesus Christ
[45:16] amen amen you may be seated
[45:20] if for a few minutes I could speak about
[45:23] uh brother Alice in the good way of
[45:25] course
[45:28] there's so much that can be said about
[45:30] one another is
[45:33] go through life we learn things about
[45:35] each other
[45:38] but I had the privilege of being part of
[45:42] brother Billy's life if I can say that
[45:46] when I first started working for the
[45:48] Department of Transportation
[45:51] Department I had the privilege of
[45:54] working with a message believer
[45:58] and that message believer was brother
[46:00] Billy Ellis
[46:03] I remember my first day at work
[46:07] it was December the 28th
[46:11] 1987
[46:14] at seven o'clock in the morning
[46:17] I had to report to Lordsburg Lordsburg
[46:23] it was one of those town that you passed
[46:25] by you never stopped
[46:30] but I had to work there
[46:32] I remember getting to work early that
[46:35] first day on a Monday
[46:39] I was excited to be working
[46:42] I was getting 525 an hour
[46:46] that was good money back then
[46:49] minimum wage was
[46:56] 375.75 but what was special about that
[47:00] day Especial
[47:02] when I got there I was greeted by
[47:06] Brother Alice
[47:08] and we used to call him tiny
[47:11] I don't know why
[47:14] but as I got to work
[47:17] the first thing he says
[47:20] medical sticks welcome bienvenido I felt
[47:25] at home being there working with brother
[47:26] Billy misses
[47:29] I had the privilege of going to the same
[47:31] church he did at that time
[47:35] I had the privilege of working with him
[47:39] I had the privilege of having a
[47:42] mother-in-law
[47:44] who was sister to his mother-in-law okay
[47:48] I had the privilege of sharing my lunch
[47:51] with him
[47:53] without ever having to offer him my
[47:56] lunch
[47:59] because when I wasn't looking
[48:02] brother Billy would go to My Lunchbox
[48:07] you would take my burritos
[48:10] and my sweet dessert
[48:13] and then you would complain to me
[48:17] it's a sticks this is sticks you need to
[48:21] pack more lunch
[48:24] and I will always respond by saying
[48:30] tiny tiny I'm gonna need your social
[48:33] security number
[48:34] Social so I can claim you on my
[48:36] dependence
[48:39] because you're killing me
[48:43] and I'm going home hungry
[48:47] and we would both laugh about it
[48:50] but we have that confidence
[48:53] whenever I will see his lunchbox
[48:57] I wasn't afraid to open it
[49:00] because I could go in there and I could
[49:04] take what I wanted
[49:07] unfortunately for me
[49:09] it was already empty yes which is why he
[49:13] would go to my lunchboxo
[49:16] I also had the privilege
[49:20] of playing the drums when you played the
[49:22] basso
[49:25] and when he's saying
[49:28] he was a statue of a man
[49:32] he was a big man
[49:34] with a humble heart
[49:37] which I never understood why they called
[49:39] them tiny
[49:42] but when he sang and he played by
[49:44] inspiration
[49:48] you could feel the presence of the Lord
[49:50] come down
[49:53] and it would move through the audience
[49:57] and that told me that here was a child
[49:59] of God
[50:02] so even though he had been born a broken
[50:05] vessel
[50:07] when he sang to the Lord
[50:10] he could feel his presence
[50:13] and he knew he had been redeemed by the
[50:16] precious blood of Jesus
[50:20] Jesus every one of us
[50:22] when we were born
[50:42] nobody's blood was worthy
[50:46] except the blood of Jesus Christ
[50:50] Jesus and I would see him when he would
[50:53] be there in church playing the base
[50:57] and sometimes Midway to the song he
[51:00] would just stop singing yes
[51:04] and just bow his head
[51:07] and start crying like a baby
[51:10] it wasn't that it wasn't a man noise
[51:15] but this broken vessel
[51:18] realized that he was in the presence
[51:24] Jesus
[51:27] and he realized he couldn't put his
[51:29] pieces back together
[51:34] but the master but Maestro had taken the
[51:37] pieces
[51:38] and he had placed him together with such
[51:41] love
[51:44] brother Branham says in the message
[51:46] Hebrews
[51:48] what a beautiful picture of
[51:52] Christo who had heard from Heaven
[51:56] that we were lost
[51:59] and he came down to earth
[52:03] to pursue the enemy
[52:06] all the way to hell
[52:09] and captured the lost souls
[52:13] and he brought us back
[52:17] and restored to us
[52:20] everything that we had yet before the
[52:31] we that were born
[52:34] to be Sons and Daughters of God but I
[52:37] said
[52:38] I came across a poem entitled
[52:42] I was a broken vessel
[52:47] it says once I was shattered
[52:51] and the pieces were scattered on the
[52:54] ground
[52:56] I was empty estaba and nothing but a
[53:00] shell is
[53:02] then a Potter found me
[53:05] in control and he picked up the pieces
[53:08] one by one he put them back together
[53:13] he handled every piece with love
[53:20] until I was whole again
[53:23] I was perfect
[53:25] though I was a simple jar
[53:29] I was perfect and empty perfect ready to
[53:34] be filled
[53:36] with the spirit of God
[53:39] when brother Billy would sing that song
[53:42] The Masterpiece
[53:46] that last part of the verse
[53:50] that says I was the vessel
[53:54] that was made of clay
[53:58] my life was broken to Pieces
[54:02] by the storms of the day
[54:05] it laid with no Beauty
[54:09] on the desert plain in El
[54:13] desierto then one day around evening
[54:17] time
[54:19] Almighty Angel was walking
[54:22] through the sands of time
[54:25] and he picked up the broken pieces
[54:30] with tears in his eyes
[54:33] he cried in his heart
[54:37] I will restore your restaurant this
[54:40] broke
[55:01] the Bible says in second Corinthians
[55:04] chapter 4
[55:07] but we have this treasure in Earthly
[55:09] vessels that the Excellency of the power
[55:12] may be of God and not of us
[55:20] we are troubled on every side yet not
[55:23] distressed we are perplexed but not in
[55:32] despairados persecuted but not forsaken
[55:35] cast down but not destroyed
[55:42] always bearing about in the body the
[55:46] dying of the Lord Jesus that the light
[55:48] also of Jesus might be made manifest in
[55:51] our bodies
[55:55] Jesus
[56:00] amen what a privilege it was to be able
[56:03] to walk with the Son of God in this hour
[56:05] yeah
[56:07] and even though he may have died a sick
[56:10] man
[56:12] is not sick anymore
[56:16] you know he he used to he used to tell
[56:19] his children we're going to go to
[56:20] brother Castillo's house
[56:24] Hermano Associates
[56:34] because he loved to have Fellowship
[56:39] he loved to be around people that he
[56:42] loved like
[56:44] and one time we had a brother that
[56:47] showed up from Arizona unexpectedly
[56:51] and my brother Bill looked at my dad and
[56:54] he said
[57:00] they come to make the to pollute the the
[57:03] talk because he didn't want nobody to
[57:04] interfere with his Fellowship
[57:08] he used to sing a song one of the verses
[57:11] would go
[57:14] I used to be a junkie
[57:18] a junkie
[57:20] and
[57:22] my my dad said brother Billy did I hear
[57:25] you right
[57:27] that you used to be a donkey
[57:30] erasum
[57:32] no he said a junkie no no I'm sorry
[57:36] and then from that time we would ask him
[57:39] brother Billy can you sing that song
[57:41] again
[57:43] used to be a donkey
[57:45] he has such a beautiful voice
[57:49] when you would play
[57:51] and sing to the Lord
[57:54] and we had the privilege of having to
[57:56] hear him sing the Lord
[58:02] and God blessed Alice family
[58:05] there's going to be days that you're
[58:07] going to feel emptiness is
[58:12] because we're humanos and we're going to
[58:15] feel the loss of our loved ones
[58:18] but I'm so glad that Jesus is still on
[58:20] the scene
[58:21] Jesus and he's there to fill the
[58:25] emptiness
[58:26] amen God bless you
[58:31] foreign
[59:15] Church full of people here
[59:19] I can see that he was well loved from
[59:22] everybody
[59:33] I can truthfully say that he was my
[59:36] friend
[59:39] because we use a word friend real
[59:42] loosely many times
[59:47] because somebody did you a favor
[59:50] or because you work with him and you say
[59:53] hi and goodbye when you're through
[59:55] working
[1:00:00] but our friend is more than that
[1:00:04] the Bible says a friend is somebody that
[1:00:07] will give his life for you
[1:00:12] and Billy what
[1:00:14] when they put him in
[1:00:18] and they called me and Jimmy to go pray
[1:00:21] he wanted for us to go pray for him
[1:00:26] I entered the hospital
[1:00:29] and grabbed his hand
[1:00:32] and his Tears start coming out of his
[1:00:35] eyes
[1:00:38] we used to be real close me his family
[1:00:42] and my family
[1:00:45] and when my wife was alive
[1:00:50] we used to visit each other
[1:00:54] and I want to say it tonight so let it
[1:00:57] be on record
[1:01:00] and Records brother Billy and sister
[1:01:03] Alicia
[1:01:06] we're the perfect host and Hostess
[1:01:12] you could not visit them unless just
[1:01:16] Richard said you wait I'm gonna make
[1:01:17] something to eat
[1:01:22] so this you see Mark that's why he was
[1:01:25] foreign
[1:01:28] I mean we were real close
[1:01:41] because all these was when our children
[1:01:44] were young
[1:01:47] and as the children start growing
[1:01:51] and they start going to school and high
[1:01:54] school
[1:01:56] and then sickness hits the people
[1:02:01] we didn't get to see each other like we
[1:02:04] used to when we our children were small
[1:02:07] uh
[1:02:10] so when I went to the house
[1:02:13] hospital he
[1:02:16] is
[1:02:17] because when you have a friend
[1:02:20] Amigo it's not a temporary friendship
[1:02:25] it's a friendship until when you get
[1:02:30] married on to death
[1:02:35] we were foreign
[1:02:55] [Music]
[1:03:14] he said those were the best pork chops
[1:03:18] well you know we had
[1:03:21] we could stay here all night and all
[1:03:24] week talking about the
[1:03:26] explodes and the things that we
[1:03:28] did foreign
[1:03:47] me and Caleb got Prof people
[1:03:55] on top of
[1:03:57] it is
[1:04:02] and and he had one that was like a jumbo
[1:04:05] ATV with a big
[1:04:07] why nobody TVs you you were with me
[1:04:11] and you too Jr
[1:04:14] anyway
[1:04:16] he said
[1:04:17] he put they are to put out Freedom back
[1:04:20] up his truck and he being this big
[1:04:23] briefly anyway
[1:04:30] I felt so good because I had never been
[1:04:33] on
[1:04:33] top one is
[1:04:37] oh
[1:04:38] we would go through all the roads there
[1:04:40] you know they showed us a place where
[1:04:49] [Music]
[1:04:53] muy bien
[1:04:55] anyway
[1:04:57] I one one evening I hadn't seen anything
[1:05:02] so here I go on the ATV
[1:05:06] and there's Mountain Roads you know you
[1:05:09] go through those dirt roads all over the
[1:05:10] hills
[1:05:13] and weigh in the distance here there was
[1:05:17] a a plane and then a bunch of big oak
[1:05:21] trees
[1:05:24] and I thought I was a professional ATV
[1:05:28] driver yep
[1:05:31] I said I'm gonna go and Scout that area
[1:05:37] because there was like a ridge coming
[1:05:40] this way and another Ridge going this
[1:05:42] way
[1:05:44] any form what you call a like a
[1:05:47] cul-de-sac Bridge
[1:05:54] but as I was going
[1:05:56] all of a sudden there was like a little
[1:05:58] gorge in a Royal yeah
[1:06:12] from his father
[1:06:16] his father would dare you to do
[1:06:18] something
[1:06:21] yeah you know I said his parents like me
[1:06:26] he
[1:06:34] you're afraid to go down there
[1:06:41] these things got a lot of power with
[1:06:43] tiny can like private Billy I can drive
[1:06:47] it too yeah
[1:06:50] I don't know
[1:07:07] [Music]
[1:07:14] Los Angeles
[1:07:24] did you see anything uh
[1:07:29] I hit the mother Road
[1:07:37] Grandes
[1:07:40] well to make a long story short but I
[1:07:43] said
[1:07:45] we were the right campus
[1:07:48] and uh
[1:07:50] I said if you guys want to kill
[1:07:53] something
[1:07:59] and full obedience entitled them to kill
[1:08:03] the bugs
[1:08:07] I told Mark
[1:08:18] and you other guys
[1:08:20] follow me
[1:08:21] so I was leading them on the ATV in Las
[1:08:25] Vegas
[1:08:26] of course Jr couldn't follow us
[1:08:31] because I I had his your father say TV
[1:08:35] you know anyway
[1:08:40] when we got to that cul-deck
[1:08:44] there was a buck running real fast
[1:08:50] a nice
[1:08:52] is
[1:09:00] I gave that back a haircut
[1:09:07] and you would know who was the lucky one
[1:09:11] he was down by the road on his truck
[1:09:16] and their back print right to your
[1:09:18] dinner yes
[1:09:21] thanks because uh gracias
[1:09:27] I still have the picture you know the
[1:09:30] photo
[1:09:31] you're gonna know how close I gave him a
[1:09:33] haircut just talked to Jr to kill
[1:09:35] yourself
[1:09:44] we killed almost everybody killed
[1:09:49] casitos
[1:09:52] so I mean he uh he was such a good
[1:09:55] friend
[1:09:58] and like I say I could give many things
[1:10:01] that you know that we did when we were
[1:10:04] together
[1:10:08] but I want to say
[1:10:12] about three days before he passed away
[1:10:14] Tres Diaz uh
[1:10:17] I went to the rehab where he was
[1:10:23] you know for he was you had to enter
[1:10:26] into the rehab and go all the way down
[1:10:32] it was about between five and six
[1:10:35] o'clock I guess yeah and uh
[1:10:37] interestingly he says and he was by
[1:10:40] himself in the room
[1:10:42] I entered into the room in real cuarto
[1:10:46] and I saw him the condition that he was
[1:10:48] in the Mirena conditions
[1:10:56] and the tears coming out from his eyes
[1:11:02] and and he just got real tight from my
[1:11:07] hand
[1:11:09] and I said uh
[1:11:12] it's so good to see you Billy this movie
[1:11:14] went away and you could see that he was
[1:11:17] in a lot of pain
[1:11:19] to the Lord and his struggle just to for
[1:11:22] words to come out from his mouth
[1:11:26] and I said
[1:11:28] this is not the feeling that I knew
[1:11:31] yesterday
[1:11:34] a lot of compassion that I had for him
[1:11:41] and he looked at me and I looked at him
[1:11:46] I said Billy idiot Billy you had a
[1:11:49] Ministry when you were well
[1:11:54] but we know
[1:11:57] that your body does not belong to you
[1:12:02] your body belongs to
[1:12:05] satanic and you say how can you say that
[1:12:08] is he

[1:12:16] song
[1:12:18] brother Brian says that when God is
[1:12:22] through with you
[1:12:25] Satan can do anything with your body
[1:12:29] let me give you an example
[1:12:33] my mother my mother

[1:20:12] can we know the way
[1:20:13] Jesus saith unto him I am the way
[1:20:16] the truth and the life no man cometh
[1:20:20] unto the father but by me

[1:20:24] of his word you may be seated
[1:20:27] as the brothers said we can stay here
[1:20:30] for a long long time
[1:20:32] talking about the life and the the times
[1:20:36] that we were able to share with brother
[1:20:38] Billy
[1:20:41] yes it was very many
[1:20:45] it's like the more that you think about
[1:20:47] it
[1:20:48] the more pages you turn back
[1:20:52] the more you remember things
[1:20:55] the more you you you see how connected
[1:20:59] uh we are with people
[1:21:03] you know I I as I was meditating I was
[1:21:06] thinking about so many different things
[1:21:10] I remember the day that I got married
[1:21:14] and my wife we we were we were blessed
[1:21:17] to have brother Billy sing in our
[1:21:19] wedding
[1:21:23] song Here we are
[1:21:26] and uh course it was a blessing to us
[1:21:29] and we still have it
[1:21:32] just to hear as we have heard many times
[1:21:35] he was his gift he sure blessed us
[1:21:40] you know brother Bill he would always
[1:21:43] call me on my birthday
[1:21:46] and the first time that he called me
[1:21:49] for you that maybe don't know maybe but
[1:21:53] but my birthday is uh December 7.
[1:21:57] anyone that knows anything about history
[1:21:59] you know what happened on December
[1:22:03] it's the day of Pearl Harbor
[1:22:06] Pearl Harbor the first time that he
[1:22:08] called
[1:22:09] and he says uh brother Caleb I want to
[1:22:13] wish you Happy Birthday
[1:22:16] this day will live in infamy
[1:22:21] and I guess he didn't realize what he
[1:22:24] had said
[1:22:25] I laughed it off with him
[1:22:28] he called me the next day and he was so
[1:22:30] worried
[1:22:33] I'm so sorry
[1:22:35] I thought infamy was a good word
[1:22:40] famous
[1:22:43] but I found out that it was famous for
[1:22:46] bad things
[1:22:49] I need to call me after that
[1:22:52] we'd always have a good laugh
[1:22:57] I remember one day he was we were able
[1:23:01] to take him on on a trip to Mexico City
[1:23:06] had never been on an airplane
[1:23:11] and he was so scared
[1:23:17] so we got him set in settled in the
[1:23:21] plane
[1:23:22] and all the guys around of course they
[1:23:25] were they were giving him a hard time
[1:23:28] oh brother Bill I've never heard the
[1:23:30] plane sound like this
[1:23:33] and then we'd hit a bump and he would
[1:23:36] hold on tight he said
[1:23:38] he would say brother Bill no this has
[1:23:40] never happened before
[1:23:42] Oh and you could just see him just
[1:23:44] sweating
[1:23:46] finally got there and he felt like he
[1:23:49] had accomplished something
[1:23:51] and so we were in church
[1:23:54] and the way this church was there was
[1:23:56] brother Paco's church
[1:23:58] and you have the church on the on the
[1:24:00] first floor
[1:24:02] and then you have the fellowship hall
[1:24:05] where we were eating companies
[1:24:12] some of the brothers had a
[1:24:30] I remember and and they were trying to
[1:24:33] convince him brother Bill we can carry
[1:24:35] you all the way up
[1:24:38] to the to the bottom of the staircases
[1:24:42] he took one look at that
[1:24:47] we all got the same visual at the same
[1:24:50] time
[1:24:52] not one of you were to slip up because
[1:24:56] we all come all the way down
[1:24:59] so many times so many stories so many
[1:25:02] things that we can say
[1:25:04] it always get a kick and we would go
[1:25:07] over and have some good old tacos
[1:25:09] tacos I always would get a kick out of
[1:25:12] my father
[1:25:13] and he said you would never believe what
[1:25:16] your father did the other day
[1:25:20] we started getting full you know what he
[1:25:24] told me he said brother Billy hermano
[1:25:27] Billy missed
[1:25:28] [Music]
[1:25:29] I'm beginning to get mad I'm getting
[1:25:32] full yeah he said it's so good I I don't
[1:25:35] want to get
[1:25:37] we always had a wonderful time when we
[1:25:40] were with him
[1:25:42] and we're thankful to God for the time
[1:25:45] that he gave us with him
[1:25:48] and as we just for a few moments we
[1:25:53] could keep on talking about different
[1:25:54] things that we had we had gone through
[1:25:56] or that we we shared with him
[1:26:00] I realized
[1:26:02] that it is a memorial service
[1:26:05] memorial service there's a purpose
[1:26:08] behind it all I am
[1:26:10] the purpose behind a memorial service
[1:26:14] is simply to preserve the remembrance of
[1:26:18] someone or something Memorial I think
[1:26:21] we've all come for that purpose
[1:26:24] observe the remembrances that we have
[1:26:27] that each one of us has a brother Bill
[1:26:29] Memorial
[1:26:31] as Jesus is speaking here in John
[1:26:34] chapter one chapter 14.
[1:26:37] there's a mystery here that Jesus is
[1:26:40] unfolding to them
[1:26:42] a mystery that he is shaking
[1:26:45] their conscience when we stayed up their
[1:26:48] subconscious
[1:26:51] he's reminding them when he says let not
[1:26:54] your heart be troubled
[1:26:57] and I want to repeat that today
[1:27:00] and I tell everyone that is here let not
[1:27:03] your hearts be troubled
[1:27:05] for in my father's house there are many
[1:27:09] men
[1:27:10] if it were not so I would have told you
[1:27:14] that he said I go to prepare a place for
[1:27:18] you
[1:27:18] and I believe every one of us has got to
[1:27:21] put our name there he said I know to
[1:27:24] prepare a place for brother Billy
[1:27:27] I mean he can put your name there this
[1:27:30] evening
[1:27:31] to prepare a place for brother Caleb
[1:27:35] let go and prepare a place for you
[1:27:39] I will come again
[1:27:42] it's a certainty Church
[1:27:45] that he would come again
[1:27:49] receive you unto himself
[1:27:52] here he is he's shaking the very
[1:27:55] conscience
[1:27:57] making the subconscious of these
[1:27:59] disciples that are here
[1:28:02] and he's trying to get them to remember
[1:28:05] something
[1:28:07] just for a few moments I won't take a
[1:28:09] lot of time
[1:28:11] trying to get them to remember
[1:28:15] not only where he had come from
[1:28:19] but he's trying to get them to remember
[1:28:22] where they had come
[1:28:26] Thomas doesn't catch it at first
[1:28:29] but Jesus makes it plain to him
[1:28:33] and he says I am the way the truth and
[1:28:37] the life
[1:28:39] found out there that the way the truth
[1:28:41] and the life
[1:28:45] and that person was who was standing in
[1:28:48] front of Thomas yes
[1:28:50] he's reminding them of something
[1:28:54] that they no longer or they are not
[1:28:57] conscious of
[1:28:58] and I believe it's the same thing
[1:29:01] tonight
[1:29:02] there are many people in this world that
[1:29:05] are not conscious of a lot of things
[1:29:09] in other words Jesus is having a
[1:29:12] memorial service with them
[1:29:14] they say brother how can you have a
[1:29:17] memorial service
[1:29:21] and I say why do you have to die to have
[1:29:24] a memorial
[1:29:27] he's having this memorial service
[1:29:36] I'm going to say it again
[1:29:52] something that had been darkened from
[1:29:54] before the foundation of the world
[1:29:58] you see when we're born into this world
[1:30:02] there are former things that we do not
[1:30:05] remember
[1:30:07] the real you and the real me
[1:30:10] and Thomas trying to understand what
[1:30:13] Jesus is saying
[1:30:16] but the problem is that he's trying to
[1:30:18] use his carnal Minds
[1:30:21] that can only go back as far as him
[1:30:24] being a toddler
[1:30:26] but Jesus is wanting to take them
[1:30:29] farther
[1:30:31] before the foundation of the world was
[1:30:34] ever laid out fundado
[1:30:38] why do we believe this message
[1:30:41] why is it that we believe the scriptures
[1:30:44] are true
[1:30:46] because this message is the only message
[1:30:51] that will help you remember
[1:30:55] who you were from the beginning
[1:30:59] I want to know how many of you have had
[1:31:01] a memorial service
[1:31:03] where it has been brought back to your
[1:31:06] memories
[1:31:08] exactly who you are where you came and
[1:31:12] where you're going yeah if you haven't
[1:31:15] if you don't know those things
[1:31:21] you can preserve the memories
[1:31:28] I believe that he believed with all his
[1:31:31] heart the message of this hour
[1:31:34] named William Miriam
[1:31:40] I'm going to say it again even when many
[1:31:42] people are walking away
[1:31:45] I believe it that much more
[1:31:48] hello everybody
[1:31:50] why okay because it helped me remember
[1:31:56] come on church I'm going to say it again
[1:31:58] because it helped me remember
[1:32:02] I was in the beginning
[1:32:04] and there has never been another message
[1:32:14] out there
[1:32:15] there are messages to make you religious
[1:32:19] there are messages that'll make you a
[1:32:21] good church
[1:32:22] but honestly the message that was
[1:32:25] brought to us by William Mary and
[1:32:27] friends
[1:32:30] that will take you back to the beginning
[1:32:33] tell you who you are
[1:32:38] in the message questions and answers on
[1:32:40] Genesis
[1:32:42] he takes us back
[1:32:45] hello everybody
[1:32:47] and this is what he says he has to look
[1:32:50] at this when God created
[1:32:54] I'd like for every one of you to put
[1:32:56] your name there today
[1:32:58] when God created brother Billy
[1:33:02] Billy or how about when God created
[1:33:04] brother Caleb
[1:33:06] he said I was before the foundation of
[1:33:10] the world
[1:33:12] show me a religion that can take you
[1:33:15] that far back
[1:33:19] [Music]
[1:33:22] my spirit
[1:33:23] I wasn't conscious of anything as far as
[1:33:27] I know
[1:33:30] I was there better Joyce
[1:33:35] come on now anybody was there who else
[1:33:38] I thought maybe I was talking to some
[1:33:41] Believers here
[1:33:44] he said I was there
[1:33:47] you can say I was there
[1:33:52] oh I don't believe you're getting it
[1:33:54] brother Randomness
[1:33:57] but now just a minute
[1:34:00] Jesus told the disciples
[1:34:03] that he knew them
[1:34:05] before the foundation of the world
[1:34:09] Paul said here that he chose us in him
[1:34:14] before the world began
[1:34:17] now there was some part of me
[1:34:21] the rest of you all here
[1:34:24] that is in Christ Jesus
[1:34:27] before the world ever began
[1:34:30] and here's to my analysis of that
[1:34:35] I think that the people today
[1:34:38] that are possessed with this Spirit
[1:34:42] the spirit
[1:34:44] a part of these Angelic beings
[1:34:49] which rotated off of God
[1:34:55] [Music]
[1:35:14] hello everybody I'm going to say it
[1:35:17] again we have become too
[1:35:19] Carnales and we don't remember
[1:35:25] the greatest thing we can achieve in
[1:35:27] this life is
[1:35:29] to find the person of the Lord Jesus
[1:35:33] only in him is eternal life
[1:35:37] and Satan knows that if you ever get the
[1:35:41] revelation of who you really are this is
[1:35:47] and where you're going there is no devil
[1:35:51] in hell that can stop them
[1:35:55] the war rages on
[1:35:58] it rages on for your soul
[1:36:02] that's why we feel trapped at times
[1:36:09] trapped in these bodies
[1:36:12] and as long as this great secret is not
[1:36:15] revealed to you
[1:36:17] you'll always feel trapped
[1:36:21] the prophet of God says that when the
[1:36:24] plans were all drawed up
[1:36:29] oh Jesus was given his church his bride
[1:36:35] he said you came into the world and died
[1:36:39] you redeemed her you Justified
[1:36:43] she never did it at the first place
[1:36:47] he was trapped into it he was blind
[1:36:52] we don't remember that no no
[1:36:55] because we bypassed our the office
[1:36:58] so we never did it in the first place
[1:37:02] where was the first place
[1:37:05] and there was war in heaven
[1:37:08] we never sinned in the first place
[1:37:12] therefore we can't sin in the last place
[1:37:16] again we did not sin in the beginning
[1:37:19] and if we didn't sin at the beginning
[1:37:24] but the reason that we can be redeemed
[1:37:30] because we never fell in our spirit
[1:37:33] we make mistakes and we fall in the
[1:37:36] flesh but in our spirit we never fell
[1:37:39] betterness
[1:37:41] in the beginning Los Angeles
[1:37:51] do I have some Believers here
[1:37:53] we were trapped in the beginning
[1:37:57] watch what he says here
[1:38:00] he the bridegroom took away your shame
[1:38:04] and put it in the sea of forgetfulness
[1:38:08] by the washing of the Water by the word
[1:38:11] and the blood of life
[1:38:13] that's what the Bible says your first
[1:38:17] husband you were married to this world
[1:38:19] is
[1:38:24] that one had to die but now the anointed
[1:38:28] bridegroom
[1:38:30] which foreign
[1:39:20] as the eagle stirth her nest
[1:39:24] the Heavenly being this bird this Eagle
[1:39:27] in a cage
[1:39:28] was born
[1:39:30] for those atmospheres and stratospheres
[1:39:34] and then big
[1:39:36] for the rest of his
[1:39:42] might is
[1:39:44] but oh I've seen sights worse than that
[1:39:48] when I see men and women
[1:39:51] who were born to be Sons and Daughters
[1:39:54] of God
[1:39:58] walking about in this world
[1:40:05] is about upon this Earth
[1:40:08] trying to satisfy their longing with
[1:40:12] some worldly pleasure
[1:40:15] trapped in Mortal life
[1:40:20] they have never gone on a trip back
[1:40:27] we must remember
[1:40:29] I'm closing now

[2:13:11] he loved the Lord
[2:13:17] you know the lord gave my dad a a gift
[2:13:20] and
[2:13:22] it wasn't for him
[2:13:26] but it was for God's people
[2:13:31] and
[2:13:32] that gift that the lord gave my dad Papa
[2:13:38] no matter how many times I wish I could
[2:13:40] sing like my dad or
[2:13:46] even he like my dad
[2:13:50] my dad didn't he instilled that in me
[2:13:52] when I was young hello
[2:13:57] in 2017
[2:13:59] I got Bell's palsy
[2:14:04] and it was it paralyzed half of my face
[2:14:10] and I wasn't able to play my saxophone
[2:14:13] no more yeah
[2:14:15] there was one person who inspired me to
[2:14:18] play the saxophone
[2:14:20] saxophone and that was uh brother
[2:14:23] Nicolas
[2:14:25] Castillo how I wish I could play like
[2:14:28] him
[2:14:29] on 2017
[2:14:33] I just couldn't play no more yeah
[2:14:38] but I thought I'm gonna do all I can
[2:14:45] to play this song for my dad
[2:14:49] because he always wanted me to play the
[2:14:51] saxophone
[2:14:55] but
[2:14:56] I remember
[2:14:58] growing up
[2:15:00] and growing going hunting
[2:15:03] and I remember I was probably
[2:15:09] and we will get to this to the spot
[2:15:12] where we'd go hunt
[2:15:16] and my dad said well we got to get up
[2:15:18] there before the sun comes up
[2:15:23] before my dad got his accident my dad
[2:15:26] was like a mule out there in the hills
[2:15:32] and we were walking High uh
[2:15:35] and we got to the to the top yeah
[2:15:40] and he says Jr he said Jr
[2:15:44] you know I love you a lot
[2:15:47] but he says I'm going to tell you a
[2:15:50] person who loves you even more
[2:15:55] he said his God God loves you so much
[2:15:57] more than I could live
[2:16:04] and he said
[2:16:06] how many heard the song the love of God
[2:16:12] he says Jared look look at I'm going to
[2:16:15] teach you the love of God this is
[2:16:18] he says imagine could we imagine
[2:16:26] the ocean filled
[2:16:29] and I he was talking I couldn't
[2:16:32] understand
[2:16:35] he says imagine the the ocean full of
[2:16:39] ink imagine
[2:16:41] and he says look at the skies
[2:16:45] he says and we're Skies of parchment
[2:16:48] made
[2:16:53] what that means
[2:16:57] it means son if the suck if the sky from
[2:17:00] this side way over there if it was one
[2:17:03] paper you see it is
[2:17:07] and every stock on earth a quill is
[2:17:12] you go through the Missouri Valley you
[2:17:15] see thousands and thousands of corn
[2:17:17] stalks and wheat
[2:17:22] but if every stock on this Earth were a
[2:17:25] quill because
[2:17:29] and every man on the earth
[2:17:32] a scribe by trees
[2:17:37] I said dad tell me what that means
[2:17:40] everybody here
[2:17:42] was
[2:17:45] taking care the whole Sky
[2:17:49] they can get every stock on this Earth
[2:17:54] he can have every man right
[2:17:59] and those guys couldn't contain the love
[2:18:02] of God if every man
[2:18:08] there wouldn't be another
[2:18:11] another stock that was available that
[2:18:13] was empty it was been used on writing
[2:18:15] yeah
[2:18:21] would drain the ocean dry it is
[2:18:29] just to write the love of God
[2:18:32] nor could the scroll contain the hole
[2:18:38] stretch from Sky to Sky yeah
[2:18:43] one of the last songs my dad
[2:18:46] um
[2:18:50] he's saying here was uh
[2:18:55] that song the road signs the signs every
[2:18:59] road every sign leads to the road back
[2:19:01] to California
[2:19:05] but he wrote this song here in Iraq
[2:19:19] he's saying this a while ago in that
[2:19:20] little
[2:19:49] I remember
[2:19:52] when I
[2:19:54] was
[2:19:55] just a little child
[2:20:01] I heard a story
[2:20:04] about a Man From Galilee
[2:20:08] [Music]
[2:20:11] they say he was crucified
[2:20:15] and he gave his life on Calvary
[2:20:24] they say die
[2:20:27] just for
[2:20:29] loving me
[2:20:38] in since I was a little
[2:20:45] when I've been loving you
[2:20:49] all through my life

[2:21:26] [Music]
[2:21:30] I'm getting closer
[2:21:33] to the end
[2:21:35] the end of my room
[2:21:40] but I
[2:21:42] thought I could feel your loving
[2:21:46] arms all around

[2:23:16] of all I'd like to thank brother Caleb
[2:23:18] for the church
[2:23:21] and uh
[2:23:25] I never thought I'd have to get up here
[2:23:31] I I've really never had the words
[2:23:35] but my dad did
[2:23:39] we were fumbling around through a few of
[2:23:42] his things
[2:23:43] and we found a notebook
[2:23:47] and in the back of it there was uh
[2:23:50] there was some writing
[2:23:53] now none of us have really heard these
[2:23:55] words
[2:24:04] but I would like to read you something
[2:24:05] that my father left us on
[2:24:11] the more and more I read it as I was
[2:24:13] sitting in my room before we came
[2:24:17] I believe that the Lord showed me that
[2:24:20] it was just a poem to show his true love
[2:24:22] to you yeah
[2:24:26] and I'd like to read it for you all
[2:24:30] and it's called a just a glimpse in time
[2:24:36] it says we were two young lovers
[2:24:40] just starting out or just starting our
[2:24:43] journey through time
[2:24:46] I remember asking God in heaven
[2:24:50] please Lord let this beauty meet your
[2:24:52] mind
[2:24:55] we stopped and took this picture
[2:24:59] in July of 69.
[2:25:03] oh how I longed in my heart
[2:25:09] we have spent many years together
[2:25:12] well over 40 since that day
[2:25:17] our Time Slips Away
[2:25:23] but little did we know sweetheart
[2:25:27] when we pause them that moment in time
[2:25:32] that God also took our pictures an
[2:25:37] eternal portrait in his own mind
[2:25:42] my father had his way with words
[2:25:48] and just when you think you don't know
[2:25:50] if he's around you anymore
[2:25:54] that confidence to give you give him a
[2:25:56] call
[2:25:58] crackle your voice one more time
[2:26:03] see him dragging up that elk uh
[2:26:12] I miss my dad
[2:26:15] but the other day in church
[2:26:18] my son uses my old Bible
[2:26:24] and uh he started crying and I came down
[2:26:27] and yeah
[2:26:28] I looked at him and I looked at my wife
[2:26:35] and
[2:26:38] my dad wrote me a message when I was 16
[2:26:41] years old
[2:26:46] I'd like to read it for you because
[2:26:47] these are his words that he would tell
[2:26:49] us
[2:26:52] now this letter was meant to me
[2:26:55] but I believe if we all have that
[2:26:57] outlook on the Bible
