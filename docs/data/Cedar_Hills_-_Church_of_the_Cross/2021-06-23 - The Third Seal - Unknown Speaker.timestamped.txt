[0:00] we have come again tonight lord to
[0:02] attempt
[0:03] uh this meeting and to
[0:07] pray thee to open to us lord
[0:10] this third seal of this book
[0:13] that it might be known to us
[0:16] that we would know or what to do and how
[0:19] to live
[0:20] and how to be better christians
[0:23] now tonight we're going to read
[0:27] from this blessed old word again in the
[0:30] sixth chapter and we start tonight with
[0:34] the third
[0:34] seal and that is the fifth verse the
[0:38] fifth and sixth verse
[0:40] now in the fifth verse and when he had
[0:44] opened the third seal i heard
[0:47] the third beast say come see and i'll be
[0:51] held in low a black horse
[0:53] and he that set on him had a pair of
[0:55] balances in his
[0:57] hand and i heard a voice in the midst of
[1:00] the four beasts saying
[1:02] a measure of wheat for a penny and three
[1:05] measures of barley for a penny
[1:07] but see thou hurt not the oil and wine
[1:12] and there was no man in heaven
[1:15] no man on earth no man beneath the earth
[1:18] or nobody was even worthy to look at the
[1:22] book
[1:23] see now just think of that then the lamb
[1:26] comes forward
[1:28] and he takes the book now john was asked
[1:31] not to weep anymore he said
[1:33] the whole the line of judah
[1:36] has prevailed and and he can take the
[1:39] book and open it
[1:40] so he turned to look for a line and he
[1:44] saw a lamb
[1:46] the elder called say a lion
[1:49] has prevailed but when he come and
[1:51] looked it was a lamb coming out
[1:53] from the throne for he was bleeding
[1:56] for the people intercessing
[2:00] for the people until the last
[2:04] soul that was put on the lamb's book of
[2:07] life before the foundational world
[2:09] come in there's just going to be so
[2:12] many of them there and that's it that's
[2:15] all
[2:17] the others won't even want to come and
[2:18] have no desire to come in
[2:20] and so then when that last
[2:24] soul comes in then the time of
[2:26] redemption is
[2:27] finished then the lamb comes forth to
[2:31] claim
[2:31] his rights to what he has redeemed
[2:37] and that's all creation then
[2:40] he said he is worthy to take the book of
[2:43] redemption now
[2:44] it doesn't belong back to the judge
[2:47] anymore
[2:48] it belongs to the redeemer and he's done
[2:51] done the work of redemption now comes
[2:54] christ you see him
[2:55] in the 10th chapter of revelations this
[2:58] right let's discuss him if you'll notice
[3:02] the first rider who he was and we found
[3:05] out last night
[3:06] scripturally that the second writer was
[3:10] exactly the same man
[3:12] only he was on another horse what
[3:15] happened
[3:15] it changed his ministry right
[3:19] we found out he was an antichrist and it
[3:23] changed his position
[3:24] now watch where we're at tonight that
[3:26] other church age now
[3:29] or come down to the third church
[3:32] it's exactly on the third church agency
[3:34] this psychological third horse
[3:36] this rider is the same one but another
[3:39] stage
[3:40] of his ministry now john sees him
[3:44] on a black horse it changed something
[3:47] else
[3:50] he has started riding him
[3:54] in the time of the dark ages
[3:57] that's what the dark horse represented
[4:00] the dark ages for
[4:01] it was a time of midnight to the true
[4:04] believers
[4:05] that was left his balances
[4:08] are his scales in his hand you see
[4:13] calling out measure of wheat for a penny
[4:15] and three measures of barley
[4:17] for a penny see actually
[4:21] that is wheat and barley is natural
[4:25] staff of life that's what brands that's
[4:27] made from
[4:29] but you see he was charging for this
[4:34] what it means that he was
[4:37] charging his subjects for the kind
[4:41] of the hope of life that he was standing
[4:44] out to them
[4:45] by making he started in that very time
[4:47] of making them
[4:49] pay for prayer
[4:53] charging for prayer they still do it
[4:57] no penis because what was he doing
[5:00] capturing the wealth of the world
[5:04] the scale weighing out
[5:08] measure of wheat or if any three
[5:10] measures of barley for a penny
[5:12] the rider on a black horse
[5:15] see he was making stripping his
[5:19] subjects of their money when the bible
[5:22] predicts that evolves about the wealth
[5:24] of the world now
[5:26] notice you see where that old money
[5:27] taken in church comes from
[5:30] [Music]
[5:32] to build an organization a big something
[5:34] million dollar here charging for
[5:35] prayer by the priest to pray people out
[5:39] of purgatory
[5:40] charging i'm taking this right out of
[5:42] the history charging for
[5:43] i guess it's novenia i guess what
[5:46] everybody knows what
[5:46] the opinion i guess that's uh something
[5:48] you have to do you know some penance
[5:50] somebody at the charge for that
[5:57] notice here's a good part now
[6:00] notice see that thou
[6:03] hurt not this
[6:05] [Music]
[6:08] just a little bit of it left baby don't
[6:11] you touch that
[6:15] now oral is symbolizes the spirit the
[6:19] holy spirit
[6:21] i'll give you a few verses if you want
[6:22] yours through scriptures in leviticus
[6:24] 8 12 where aaron before he went ahead be
[6:26] anointed with the arlington
[6:28] and zechariah 4 12 the all coming
[6:30] pouring through the pipes and said this
[6:32] is my spirit
[6:33] or another thing if you want to see
[6:35] matthew 14 25
[6:37] there was a foolish virgin 25 3 the
[6:40] foolish virgin
[6:40] had no oral no spirit and
[6:44] matthew 25 4 the wise virgin had
[6:47] all in her land spiritville
[6:50] now oral typifies
[6:53] spirit and wine
[6:57] symbolizes stimulation
[7:00] of revelation
[7:04] oh i i like to run over the place i
[7:07] wanted to wake up the neighborhood and
[7:08] the lord showed me that
[7:09] [Music]
[7:10] stimulation of revelation
[7:14] okay oil and wine
[7:17] in the bible is associated together
[7:21] always i got the concordance look the
[7:24] street on that lag
[7:25] it's like that where wine and oil goes
[7:27] together all the time
[7:28] see
[7:36] of god and the true believer filled with
[7:39] oil
[7:40] and the revelation is revealed the
[7:43] stimulation becomes so great
[7:45] that he makes him behave his self a
[7:48] [Music]
[7:54] [Applause]
[7:54] [Music]
[7:56] normal
[8:07] to this rider in black don't you hurt
[8:11] my wine and my oil don't you touch it
[8:16] my wine oil i've got just a little bit
[8:19] of it down there but he's still a little
[8:21] bit there
[8:22] [Music]
[8:25] now you can go on through and measure
[8:27] out all that kind of life it's your butt
[8:28] not that's up to you you're going to pay
[8:30] for it down there
[8:31] but when you come across that wine or
[8:33] you leave it alone
[8:35] i was here and i and i heard a voice in
[8:39] the midst
[8:40] of the four beasts what was it
[8:43] the lamb
[8:44] [Music]
[8:44] [Applause]
[8:45] [Music]

[9:07] one that said it
[9:08] oh my amen
[9:12] the lamb not the four beasts didn't
[9:14] announce this the lamb said itself
[9:15] well to the best of my understanding
[9:20] and the best of that i know
[9:24] and with all that i believe in my heart
[9:27] that's the true meaning of those three
[9:31] seals
[9:32] i want to thank god for it and i'll say
[9:35] this that it's a revelation
[9:38] that he gave me he gave that
[9:42] to me the revelation and i do believe
[9:46] that we're
[9:47] living in the last days
