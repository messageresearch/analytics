[34:57] cannot have to write a theme that we all
[34:59] are to stare death in the face and say I
[35:02] am not afraid of you mira la muerte like
[35:05] I write this literally no let em oh I

[35:12] Javier Akiva morir mañana what would you
[35:15] change
[35:16] Guerra Loki become mirrors what would
[35:18] you do differently today
[35:19] kçêäa differente stay Zoe I want to
[35:22] quote the Apostle Paul Jarris eternal a
[35:24] post Olsen what he had to say
[35:26] about death look in the book of first
[35:29] Corinthians the fifteenth chapter and in
[35:31] Libra the pre-medical interest capital o
[35:33] Keeffe 54th to the 55th verse they were
[35:37] so cincuenta Quattro Cinque when they
[35:38] sing it says when this corruptible shall
[35:40] put on incorruption understood corrupt
[35:43] Avista incorruption and this mortal
[35:45] shall have put on immortality mr. Mort
[35:48] else if he's telling mortality then
[35:50] shall be brought to pass the saying that
[35:52] is written and to Sicily that El dish
[35:54] okay they say death is swallowed up in
[35:57] victory la muerte por la victoria then
[35:59] he stands and he makes this statement is
[36:02] the para sa like lettuce you he says o
[36:04] death the same where take where's dice
[36:06] team and don't they start to Aggie ho
[36:08] grave is a fulcrum where is thy victory
[36:11] understand to be told here was a man a
[36:13] mortal man that could stare death in the
[36:15] face
[36:16] I guess that one hombre morte alchemy
[36:17] now and say where is your sting
[36:19] you see I don't de stuck or Not Afraid
[36:21] of you death not at the moment you see
[36:23] death is like is like a bee lemarcus
[36:26] come una vaca goes around and and it
[36:29] takes its stinger and it puts it in in
[36:31] different people you know I like it yeah
[36:33] a soggy horn ah diferentes and
[36:34] throughout time man has always feared
[36:36] death yeah Travis de todos tiempos el
[36:39] hombre tell me because they didn't know
[36:40] what to expect but can answer me no kiss
[36:42] better job saw how man that would die
[36:45] hope Mira como scale hombre Maria then
[36:47] he'd say but but but why is there not
[36:49] Dwight we not see man raise up again
[36:51] they don't scale hombre we see the
[36:54] flowers die there there during the the
[36:57] fall in tip epoch and get lost in the
[37:01] ring they raise up again in the tree is
[37:04] the same they lose their leaves los
[37:06] árboles know what about man ok the Loom
[37:09] goes down into the ground
[37:11] viola Tierra and then we don't see no
[37:12] more of him yeah but one day this be
[37:15] called death he it's stung the wrong
[37:18] person let P coil unbreakable its aw man
[37:22] by the name of Jesus Mirel Umbria mother
[37:24] Jesu Christo what he didn't know was
[37:26] that Jesus was not just a man look at
[37:29] most obvious case the hombre no stolen
[37:30] he was the god man
[37:32] I don't normally the austere that was
[37:33] God in flesh he does do st. Carney and
[37:35] when this this became any stung him he
[37:38] contrasted heaven
[37:39] because he tried to pull his stinger out
[37:41] and couldn't suppose I kind of like
[37:43] honey he had to leave his stinger in
[37:45] this man called Jesus so what can I hide
[37:47] a saggy hornet alone therefore from that
[37:49] point on this is a pun to another land
[37:52] he had no stinger anymore Yankee
[37:54] now death is nothing but a scarecrow
[37:57] about a Martinez musky it was assumed in
[37:59] the back make you fear okay I said make
[38:02] my Rambo sorry but that's why Paul could
[38:04] stand up and say these words there so
[38:06] Paolo pepper all it does they are a
[38:09] smart thing death where is your sting
[38:11] don't it's not talking Oh grave where is
[38:13] your victory
[38:15] sepulchral don't they start to Victoria
[38:17] and you look at this of this this
[38:18] tremendous man by the name of the
[38:20] Apostle Paul and ohmmeter own most
[38:21] humbly tantra mental apostle's i ask the
[38:23] question again what would you do if you
[38:25] knew that you were gonna die tomorrow la

[1:17:26] sister and grandmother and friend who
[1:17:29] battled into her final days we always
[1:17:32] looked forward to the holidays at
[1:17:34] Grandma's house the smell of mint

[1:17:47] plenty never did she say she didn't have
[1:17:50] enough when she gave she gave from the
[1:17:52] heart and it showed everything she did
[1:17:55] was wholeheartedly her life wasn't about
[1:17:58] what she did what she had or didn't have
[1:18:00] it was more about helping and giving to
[1:18:02] others and for this a Lord truly blessed
[1:18:05] her always she was persistent and
[1:18:09] insisted on doing things for herself
[1:18:11] until she went to be with the Lord
[1:18:14] she always thanked the Lord for her
[1:18:16] health and forgiving her strengths she
[1:18:19] showed us a were Catholic ethic like no
[1:18:21] other having worked at Stallman farms
[1:18:23] for over 60 years as a pillar of
[1:18:26] strength for our family she helped many
[1:18:37] of us during difficult times in her life
[1:18:41] sometimes not knowing how much we needed
[1:18:43] it pray that the strength she had is
[1:18:46] bestowed upon her family during this
[1:18:48] much-needed time lastly as she told us
[1:18:52] in her final days she prayed for
[1:18:54] everyone and asked the Lord to take care
[1:18:57] of everyone you did it matter who you
[1:19:00] were where you came from or why she
[1:19:05] always opened her home to whoever
[1:19:06] whomever came and made sure you left
[1:19:09] with the full belly I drink in hand
[1:19:13] coca-cola not water
[1:19:16] Pepsi not sprite coca-cola or oreganata
[1:19:21] but most of all her blessing did I leave
[1:19:25] you with today
[1:19:27] Joseph been the girl of squeeza my
[1:19:35] grandma was a strongest person I know
[1:19:37] she was fearless when she was faced with
[1:19:40] a difficult circumstance she didn't
[1:19:42] folds her hands up in two feet but she
[1:19:43] would roll up her sleeves and face it
[1:19:45] with courage she was never one to
[1:19:47] complain about anything even through to
[1:19:49] her last days when she was bedridden I
[1:19:51] would go and visit her and say hi
[1:19:52] grandma wants a letter she would answer
[1:19:55] was he and me huh and she would say it
[1:19:57] in such a way as up to say well what
[1:19:59] else do you expect of course I'm doing
[1:20:00] good she wasn't afraid of death one day
[1:20:03] my mom mentioned to her that a lot of

[1:20:06] my grandma said C Eon the sweat thought
[1:20:08] up Ilona and my mom told her if she
[1:20:11] comes knocking don't open the door
[1:20:12] my grandma replied death is afraid of me
[1:20:15] my grandma taught us many lessons such
[1:20:19] as even when it seems like you don't
[1:20:20] have anything the Lord will provide when
[1:20:24] you give from your heart a blessing will
[1:20:25] always come back to you she would say
[1:20:28] don't pray don't just pray for your own
[1:20:30] she would pray for every state in every
[1:20:32] country those in hospitals and prisons
[1:20:35] and for those who didn't have anything
[1:20:36] to eat most of all she was always
[1:20:39] grateful to God for everything in the
[1:20:41] good times and in the hard times she was
[1:20:44] the happiest when she could give and
[1:20:45] didn't expect anything in return I
[1:20:47] honestly believe she worked until she
[1:20:49] was 87 years old so she could have more
[1:20:51] to give or to be able to help someone
[1:20:53] our prophet brother Branham teaches us
[1:20:55] that eternal life is living for others
[1:20:57] and this quote that he preached in the
[1:21:00] sermon that day on Calvary reminded me
[1:21:02] of her now the first thing that I want
[1:21:05] to say is Jesus never lived for himself
[1:21:07] his life was spent for others that's
[1:21:09] perfectly eternal life when you say you
[1:21:12] go to church and do good things that's
[1:21:13] fine
[1:21:14] but when you live your life for yourself
[1:21:15] you haven't eternal life eternal life is
[1:21:18] living for others it proved it when it
[1:21:20] come in the Lamb of God he had lived and
[1:21:22] he had eternal life because he did not
[1:21:24] live for himself he lived for others and
[1:21:26] he receive eternal life by receiving
[1:21:28] that day and you
[1:21:29] live for yourself no more you live for
[1:21:31] others that's what my grandma did
[1:21:34] that's who she was she lived for others
[1:21:36] we were thankful to God for giving a mom
[1:21:39] a grandma a sister a aunt as loving and
[1:21:42] valiant does her
