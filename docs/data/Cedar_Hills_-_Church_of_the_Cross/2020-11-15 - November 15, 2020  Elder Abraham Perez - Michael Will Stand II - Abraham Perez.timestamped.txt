[35:26] all of us
[35:30] amen I'm going to throw an atomic bomb
[35:34] pretty soon so
[35:37] you your seat belts this
[35:42] morning this will be my third message
[35:45] and Michael will
[35:51] stand with a subtitle the two
[35:55] tribulations
[36:04] Revelation
[36:07] 6 1
[36:15] apyp I saw when the lamb opened one of
[36:18] the seals and I heard a SE word the
[36:21] noise I'm sorry not 61 forgive me 6
[36:28] 12 that's what me and you were talking
[36:30] about to the people yeah six and when he
[36:35] had opened the six seal and lo there was
[36:38] a great earthquake and the sun became
[36:41] black as sack cloth of hair and the moon
[36:44] became his
[36:55] blood
[37:01] Daniel
[37:06] 121 and at that time shall Michael stand
[37:09] up Hallelujah the great Prince with
[37:12] standeth for the children of thy people
[37:14] and there shall be a time of trouble
[37:17] such as never was since there was the
[37:19] nation even to that same time and at
[37:23] that time thy people shall be delivered
[37:26] everywh one that shall be found written
[37:28] in the
[37:51] book notice that the word shell is
[37:55] mentioned three times on that
[37:57] verse because the word shall means into
[38:00] the
[38:01] future in the
[38:08] future the Lord add His blessings to
[38:11] read the word you may be
[38:17] seated it is this is very
[38:20] delicate and what
[38:23] uh he was talking here
[38:27] in
[38:28] Daniel that it was going to be a time of
[38:33] trouble as we're going to find
[38:36] out it is such a big
[38:40] event that even Joel prophesied about
[38:44] the six
[38:46] Hill it was Isaiah that prophesied about
[38:50] the
[38:52] six and Jesus if you read on Matthew he
[38:55] prophesied of about this
[38:59] time so we see Daniel speak saying this
[39:04] in the Book of
[39:07] Daniel about the end
[39:10] time we see in Daniel chapter 9 verse
[39:23] 21 yay while I was speaking in prayer
[39:27] even the man Gabriel whom I had seen in
[39:29] the vision at the beginning being caused
[39:33] to fly swiftly touched me about the time
[39:36] of the evening of
[39:51] oblation verse
[39:53] 24 70 weeks are determined upon thy
[40:01] people and upon thy Holy
[40:04] City to finish the
[40:09] transgression and to make an end of
[40:13] sins and to make reconciliation for
[40:18] iniquity and to bring an in Everlasting
[40:25] righteousness and to seal up the vision
[40:28] and prophecy and to anoint the most
[40:40] holy to seal up the vision and
[40:47] prophecy verse 2
[40:53] see Daniel had prophesied
[40:58] these things he saw it in a
[41:01] vision and then they told him to seal
[41:05] it until the end
[41:08] time which the end time is the end of
[41:12] the 70th
[41:15] week why was it
[41:18] sealed this vision and
[41:21] prophecy was for the end time and in
[41:25] that time
[41:26] Michael will
[41:29] stand for the children of thy
[41:33] people which the children of the people
[41:35] was Daniel's people which were the
[41:41] Jews and Jacob's trouble was the Great
[41:50] Tribulation but there is another
[41:54] tribulation St Matthew M
[42:02] 24
[42:07] 21 don't get scared what I'm going to
[42:10] tell
[42:13] you for then shall be Great Tribulation
[42:17] such as was not since the beginning of
[42:20] the world to this time no nor ever shall
[42:25] be
[42:33] Matthew
[42:38] 2421 I'm sorry
[42:41] 22 and except those days should be
[42:45] shortened there should be no flesh saved
[42:49] but for the elect sake those days shall
[42:52] be
[42:55] shortened
[43:01] the Lord corrected me on this
[43:07] verse remember years ago me and you
[43:09] there were talking there in the cins
[43:14] house we said what does he mean that the
[43:18] days will be
[43:21] short of course somebody said well the
[43:24] that a clock won't have 20 2 4 hours
[43:29] remember we won't mention
[43:33] names and that's why brother
[43:37] Brenham he said don't
[43:41] misplace or dislocate
[43:47] scripture so we said there'll be Great
[43:52] Tribulation and except those days be
[43:55] shortened
[43:57] for the elect
[44:00] sake and know that scripture is
[44:07] compound he was not talking about
[44:11] us our days have not been shorted if you
[44:15] take it by the
[44:17] time he's talking about the Jew
[44:20] here our days have not been
[44:23] T our our days have been l
[44:29] these Rapture should have happened
[44:32] already brother says we're living in
[44:35] borrow
[44:38] time he has given us more
[44:41] days because he's God rich in
[44:46] Mercy and he has given us many
[44:50] days not
[44:53] willing that nobody should perish
[44:57] but that everybody have everlasting
[45:03] life we thought the the end was going to
[45:06] be in
[45:10] 1977 and not dispensation less more than
[45:13] 2,000
[45:16] years and here we are in 2,000
[45:22] 20 God rich in Mercy
[45:26] amen he's given us
[45:28] time he has given us even though we
[45:31] don't
[45:36] Merit but it says if the days were not
[45:41] shortened no flesh should be
[45:44] saved It's the Great
[45:48] Tribulation the Great Tribulation last
[45:50] three and a half
[45:52] years that's why he shortened those
[45:59] days 144,000 could be
[46:06] saved we used we used to apply that to
[46:13] us but God is revealing the last
[46:17] days amen there shall be Great
[46:23] Tribulation now now give me same Matthew
[46:31] 24:29 immediately after the tribulation
[46:35] of those
[46:38] days now there's another
[46:42] tribulation after the tribulation of
[46:45] those
[46:47] days notice the sicks heal
[46:50] again shall the sun be
[46:54] darkened and the Moon moon shall not
[46:56] give her
[46:58] light and the Stars shall fall from
[47:03] Heaven and the powers of the heaven
[47:06] should be
[47:08] shaken but
[47:10] notice that
[47:13] tribulation was in the time when General
[47:16] Titus put an army around
[47:21] Jerusalem you're on that
[47:23] rooftop don't go down and get you
[47:28] know and notice he's talking about that
[47:34] tribulation that
[47:36] scripture was a local
[47:40] tribulation it was a tribulation for the
[47:45] Jew but the other one is a worldwide
[47:51] tribulation but noce it affects the Jew
[47:55] both
[47:59] amen
[48:01] notice
[48:03] tribulation what is
[48:07] tribulation
[48:09] tribulation is

[52:28] toake but we got people this church that
[52:31] are afraid and
[52:34] panic some are so afraid that they won't
[52:37] even come and congregate with
[52:41] us in whom have you
[52:45] believed in

[52:57] whatsoever but we we have to use caution
[53:00] like our pastor has told
[53:04] us I hope this message wakes you up some
[53:07] of
[53:11] you you know what Caleb I walk each day
[53:14] like it was any other day
[53:21] just doesn't the Bible say
[53:25] that the diseases that he brought on the
[53:29] Egyptians will not H
[53:36] you but in whom have you
[53:39] believed no the great the
[53:44] tribulation that you're
[53:48] troubled maybe some of you you you have
[53:51] gotten Corona
[53:54] virus
[53:56] and the Lord lets it
[53:58] happen as a trial to see what you do as
[54:01] we're going to find out
[54:05] later didn't try to scare you but let's
[54:08] go a little
[54:09] further word is so rich God help us so
[54:14] then it says that the days will be
[54:19] shorten on account of the
[54:22] elect you see brother and
[54:27] elect I am the
[54:30] bride he's talking about the elect which
[54:34] are the
[54:40] 144,000 that's the elect that he's
[54:42] talking
[54:44] about the days will be shortened so they
[54:47] can be
[54:49] saved amen
[54:54] notice St Matthew
[55:02] 243 and he he said upon the Mount of
[55:08] Olives the disciples came unto him
[55:13] privately tell us when shall these
[55:16] things
[55:17] be and what shall be the sign of thy
[55:21] coming and of the end of the world
[55:26] would you like to
[55:28] know would you like to
[55:30] know that's why you come to church
[55:33] for so you can learn Sunday morning is
[55:37] Sunday
[55:39] school you go to school to
[55:45] learn
[55:47] notice when shall this things
[55:50] be where have been where have you been
[55:54] all this time
[55:57] it's here
[55:59] already notice how about the sign of his
[56:05] coming he already
[56:08] came he already
[56:10] came didn't the Bible says that Elijah
[56:13] must first
[56:16] come he already came and you didn't
[56:19] know but he's talking L about his
[56:22] coming he already came
[56:26] the scripture is compound he already
[56:32] came I I got I got you people thinking
[56:35] on
[56:37] that he already came I thought he was
[56:41] coming for us in the
[56:45] Raptor my God help
[56:47] us you then notice remember the
[56:52] scripture is
[56:53] compound
[56:55] first Thessalonians
[57:04] 4:16 for the Lord himself shall descend
[57:07] from heaven with a
[57:13] shout let me read it again so you can
[57:19] understand the Lord himself shall
[57:22] descend with a wedding
[57:33] dress is then we're supposed to be the
[57:37] word
[57:40] bright and AR you supposed to dress with
[57:43] the
[57:44] word so he had to come
[57:48] down because he he came for a
[57:52] bride brother says all here in Brom
[57:57] Tabernacle I see a lot of sisters
[58:01] here but only one gets to go home with
[58:06] me so there's many people in the
[58:11] world but the Lord came only for
[58:16] you he only came for
[58:21] you why did he come with a
[58:26] dress and he says
[58:34] notice those that are in Christ will God
[58:38] bring with
[58:40] him and you cannot go to the wedding
[58:44] supper without the wedding
[58:47] dress so he'll descend with a
[58:53] shout a message to get you
[58:57] ready a message to dress
[59:01] you he says and he came with a voice of
[59:06] Archangel which is a voice of
[59:09] Resurrection then the trumpet of
[59:14] God you together the
[59:18] people so
[59:21] they they say brother benam has to come
[59:26] in the tent Ministry in order to do all
[59:30] these three these
[59:35] two because he came with a
[59:39] shout but he still has to do the voice
[59:41] of Archangel and the trumpet of
[59:47] God I know we've taught you
[59:50] this but many times you
[59:53] forget because you are in
[59:56] Tribulation you are in
[59:58] distress you hear too much on the
[1:00:01] TV you hear too much about Donald Trump
[1:00:04] and Joe
[1:00:06] Biden it worries you so
[1:00:08] much you know what you know who I voted
[1:00:12] for I voted for Jesus
[1:00:17] Christ that's who I voted
[1:00:21] for I was telling the brother Caleb
[1:00:25] that I have voted only once in my
[1:00:29] lifetime when I was 21 years
[1:00:32] old well I'm going to vote I'm 21 years
[1:00:36] old I voted the same time that brother
[1:00:41] Brenham
[1:00:43] voted in
[1:00:46] 1960 brother Brenham did not vote for
[1:00:50] JFK for JFK he voted for Nixon foron and
[1:00:54] me a green
[1:00:59] horn they didn't know the difference
[1:01:02] between a bean or a
[1:01:10] l I voted for Nixon
[1:01:13] too and so me and brother vam the we
[1:01:17] voted for the same
[1:01:19] man and that was the last time I
[1:01:23] voted
[1:01:29] you see so who so who do you V for and
[1:01:34] and the people are in such
[1:01:40] tribulation they they they even killed
[1:01:43] you know they they they pay them
[1:01:46] millions of dollars and they fix the
[1:01:48] machines and this and
[1:01:53] that
[1:01:55] that's how John Kennedy beat
[1:01:58] Nixon the FBI
[1:02:01] founded FBI in the state of
[1:02:04] California every time you pull the
[1:02:08] lever and voted for
[1:02:10] Nixon automatically you were voting for
[1:02:17] JFK so you see how
[1:02:20] rotten because Satan is aead of all
[1:02:27] [Music]
[1:02:28] politics so why does brother B I have to
[1:02:31] come to give the voice of

[1:13:04] people
[1:13:06] notice that this me message could not
[1:13:11] come until
[1:13:13] now because it was never in the
[1:13:16] condition that it's
[1:13:20] now the Bible says as it was in the days
[1:13:25] of
[1:13:27] lot brother Brenham
[1:13:29] said lot was a type of
[1:13:33] America and where was
[1:13:35] Lot in
[1:13:37] [Music]
[1:13:39] Sodom yet in lot there was
[1:13:44] righteousness and the problem
[1:13:47] was he was mixing with those
[1:13:50] people even though he had righteous
[1:13:54] I ask you
[1:13:56] people especially you
[1:13:59] youth there is
[1:14:01] rightous in you but a lot of you are
[1:14:05] mixing with
[1:14:08] some thus say the

[1:17:28] heer which is a female
[1:17:32] cow that's
[1:17:35] red and no
[1:17:38] spots has never been
[1:17:42] yolked and this
[1:17:45] heer had to be killed by the priest
[1:17:48] before the whole Congregation of
[1:17:52] Israel
[1:17:55] and all of it had to be
[1:17:57] burned outside the
[1:18:00] camp to make
[1:18:03] what Waters of
[1:18:08] Separation are you people Waters of
[1:18:13] Separation does it Waters pertain to
[1:18:18] people and you must
[1:18:20] separate that's why my body might be
[1:18:23] here in
[1:18:25] Sodom I don't mix with
[1:18:28] them I have
[1:18:31] separated I am Waters of
[1:18:40] separation and in
[1:18:42] notice and in the fire they put three
[1:18:47] things
[1:18:49] Scarlet that ship's wool died with blood
[1:18:57] they
[1:18:58] put CER
[1:19:01] wood Cedar
[1:19:04] Cedro is in this Church Cedar
[1:19:08] Hills Cedar
[1:19:12] Hills notice Cedar speaks of the cross
[1:19:16] the
[1:19:17] C CU it it is
[1:19:21] white with red
[1:19:24] streaks and white speaks of
[1:19:27] righteousness of the
[1:19:30] Cross how can that
[1:19:33] be when the cross was a
[1:19:39] curse but red
[1:19:42] streaks it speaks of the
[1:19:45] blood that made it
[1:19:50] righteous and then come and with
[1:19:55] hup then they would burn it
[1:19:59] together and they got the
[1:20:03] Ashes to make water of
[1:20:08] Separation it watched the
[1:20:13] unbeliever for
[1:20:16] purification and he was sprinkled with
[1:20:18] the
[1:20:20] edges that's why the Apostle Paul
[1:20:23] said that he might sanctify and clean
[1:20:30] us with the washing of the Water by the
[1:20:36] word he CHS that something
[1:20:40] died that the ashes of this
[1:20:43] heer it died for his
[1:20:47] sins the Lord told
[1:20:51] Moses even all the
[1:20:55] heers throughout
[1:20:57] history are
[1:21:00] lost
[1:21:02] yours will remain
[1:21:05] forever the
[1:21:08] priest who was to burn a new
[1:21:14] heer was sprinkled with the ashes of the
[1:21:18] first
[1:21:21] he
[1:21:23] they would before it ran
[1:21:26] out they got the ashes a little of the
[1:21:29] ashes of the first
[1:21:33] C and put and leave it
[1:21:37] there and then they
[1:21:39] got the ashes of the new C
[1:21:45] of that's why the old was mixed with the
[1:21:51] new so why a
[1:21:54] heer to remind
[1:21:57] them of the golden C that they worshiped
[1:22:01] in the
[1:22:04] desert and the heer the mother
[1:22:10] C was cleaning the field of her of her
[1:22:17] child notice from the time of
[1:22:21] Moses to the destruction of the second
[1:22:27] temple there have been nine
[1:22:31] heers they
[1:22:33] said that in the days of the 10th
[1:22:40] heerah will
[1:22:43] come so they pray that's why they pray
[1:22:46] and cry at the Wailing
[1:22:51] Wall
[1:22:55] so
[1:22:56] then they say that Jesus Christ has to
[1:23:02] come and do these three things that we
[1:23:05] talked
[1:23:11] about acts
[1:23:21] 319 repent ye therefore and be converted
[1:23:26] that your sins may be blooded out when
[1:23:29] the times are refreshing shall come from
[1:23:31] the presence of the
[1:23:44] Lord you know
[1:23:48] Caleb all through the years that I have
[1:23:51] studied
[1:23:55] Tommy I would see this even when I was a
[1:23:58] pastor of the apostolic
[1:24:01] church I couldn't make heads or tails of
[1:24:05] that verse or that
[1:24:09] word oh
[1:24:12] yeah refreshing was a cold
[1:24:19] beer refresh yeah or you get a
[1:24:23] soda and especially during the summer
[1:24:26] it's real
[1:24:29] refreshing but in the apostolic church
[1:24:32] we never preached in English only in
[1:24:37] Spanish my
[1:24:41] mother my my mother and and all and
[1:24:44] everyone there what they know about
[1:24:46] English but you know what Jonathan
[1:24:49] Jonathan in the Spanish Bible it's
[1:24:54] says in in in the Spanish Bible it says
[1:24:57] time of refreshing
[1:25:00] or I I see two meanings there something
[1:25:03] can be refreshing
[1:25:05] ref William I mean it's probably put in
[1:25:09] the freezer or
[1:25:14] refrigerated so you know what I would
[1:25:19] do it would go over my
[1:25:21] head but I had a good
[1:25:25] tutor my T first tutor was Bernie
[1:25:30] Garcia you brothers and sisters are
[1:25:32] hearing me in
[1:25:34] Phoenix
[1:25:36] Pho the two great
[1:25:40] Apostles amen were my
[1:25:42] tutors ber Garcia and
[1:25:45] Tomas Bernie Garcia Manas
[1:25:49] perz
[1:25:51] so
[1:25:52] I went and put it on the
[1:26:01] screen
[1:26:04] refreshing in the Greek an
[1:26:10] anoi that's
[1:26:13] Greek oh
[1:26:21] an Rachel last night what does he have
[1:26:25] to do with
[1:26:31] refreshing
[1:26:33] Hallelujah so
[1:26:37] refreshing is
[1:26:41] what do you have
[1:26:47] the you don't have it the okay
[1:26:55] refreshing let's you know what let's
[1:26:57] finish uh that verse in in the book of
[1:27:01] Acts in chapter 3 so we can see what
[1:27:04] that word
[1:27:07] [Music]
[1:27:09] means verse 20 he shall send Jesus
[1:27:12] Christ which before was preached unto
[1:27:18] you whom the Heaven Must receive until
[1:27:22] the times of restitution of all things
[1:27:25] which God had spoken by the mouth of all
[1:27:28] his holy prophets in the world
[1:27:46] begin
[1:27:48] refreshing
[1:27:50] Ori means patience
[1:27:57] he he what was taught to
[1:28:03] them and
[1:28:05] what he was saying
[1:28:08] here I hope it doesn't happen to any of
[1:28:15] you there will be
[1:28:18] times the
[1:28:20] refriger of refreshing there will be
[1:28:23] times of
[1:28:26] refreshing and if you're not standing in
[1:28:29] the word of
[1:28:30] God you're going to fall by the right
[1:28:34] side because the
[1:28:37] word this word notice what it
[1:28:42] means to have
[1:28:44] patience to
[1:28:47] endure to hold up against
[1:28:51] things
[1:28:52] and to be
[1:28:59] longsuffering from behind this
[1:29:02] Pulpit treasure it in your heart in your
[1:29:06] soul so when the times of Corona virus

[1:29:15] tribulations you can

[1:29:20] times
[1:29:24] refreshing there'll be
[1:29:26] time you're not all the time going 100
[1:29:30] miles an
[1:29:32] hour or
[1:29:36] whatever and you don't have to raise
[1:29:38] your
[1:29:39] hands how many times a week do you feel
[1:29:41] down in the
[1:29:48] Dum I don't feel too good

[1:30:12] provide I've never seen the righteous
[1:30:18] forsaken they even putting the money in
[1:30:20] the coins
[1:30:24] God We
[1:30:30] Trust oh no I trust in Benjamin Franklin
[1:30:34] or Alexander Hamilton
[1:30:39] or I've heard that many
[1:30:43] times
[1:30:46] noce ah long
[1:30:50] suffering
[1:30:53] so I'm going to my time is going fast
[1:30:56] and I'm going to skip a lot of this best
[1:30:59] me you have to
[1:31:02] skip but notice there's a part here that
[1:31:05] I
[1:31:07] okay I'm going to skip all this
[1:31:12] here the son of
[1:31:17] man
[1:31:19] okay the church had to go through
[1:31:22] justification
[1:31:25] Luther through sanctification
[1:31:29] Wesley baptism of the Holy Spirit the
[1:31:33] Pentecostal go right into the Perfection
[1:31:36] of the son of
[1:31:38] man that's when husband and wife will be
[1:31:42] the self-same
[1:31:48] person God will be so manifested into
[1:31:52] his
[1:31:54] bride because both of them will be the
[1:31:59] same so
[1:32:01] then Jesus when he returns back to his
[1:32:05] church in physical
[1:32:10] form in the
[1:32:12] people as in the way of of being a
[1:32:17] prophet brother Bram in the message
[1:32:21] Jehovah
[1:32:23] believe in the Lord Jesus
[1:32:26] Christ and believe me to be his
[1:32:31] Prophet will you do
[1:32:34] that you believe that Christ sent me to
[1:32:38] do this for
[1:32:41] you and I just act in his
[1:32:50] Stead
[1:32:52] remember Caleb Wednesday that we were
[1:32:54] making the tapes to the people of
[1:32:58] Uganda we make a good
[1:33:01] team when he's
[1:33:03] speaking and I want to add
[1:33:06] something I said Caleb can you stop yeah
[1:33:11] sure so so when I he he spoke about the
[1:33:14] first
[1:33:16] seal and then when I start speaking
[1:33:18] about the second
[1:33:20] seal he said he said can I stop you for
[1:33:25] for yeah he says go ahead we help each
[1:33:29] other cuz we were talking about chapter
[1:33:32] 13 of the Book of
[1:33:36] Revelation that the Pope the
[1:33:41] vi he
[1:33:43] said
[1:33:45] instead of the Son of
[1:33:48] God I am Son of God
[1:33:52] he he took to the people the place of of
[1:33:56] the of the
[1:33:58] son and then Caleb says can I add
[1:34:01] something I said
[1:34:02] sure what we talk brother says in
[1:34:09] his I want to you know now that he was
[1:34:12] going to instead of I am never said in
[1:34:17] his dead he has permission I
[1:34:20] will
[1:34:23] you see so then that's what it
[1:34:29] was and I'm going to skip all this to go
[1:34:33] to
[1:34:36] her so he it was revealing the son of
[1:34:42] man the word to unite the marriage of
[1:34:46] the
[1:34:49] Bride the bridegroom call will
[1:34:57] come when the when he will come
[1:35:01] down and he'll come in human
[1:35:05] flesh to unite the two
[1:35:08] together we have to have the
[1:35:11] word because he is the word and the two
[1:35:15] unite
[1:35:16] together and to do that it will take
[1:35:22] the manifestation of the revealing of
[1:35:24] the son of
[1:35:26] man and then we will have to go with him
[1:35:30] to the wedding
[1:35:33] supper when the word here unites the two
[1:35:39] together
[1:35:43] notice what does a men
