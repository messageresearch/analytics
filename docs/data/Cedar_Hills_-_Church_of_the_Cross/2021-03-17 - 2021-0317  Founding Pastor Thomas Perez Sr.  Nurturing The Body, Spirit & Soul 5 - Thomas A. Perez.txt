see all four dominions o has been given to the family of the king amen amen you may be seated amen it's my privilege to introduce the word tonight amen we'll be watching dvd of our founding pastor brother thomas petty senior nurturing the body spirit and soul number five hope you're ready for a good one tonight man say there is no resurrection neither angel nor spirit but the pharisees confess both resurrection for the wonderful rain that you gave us here in this state we pray that you bless brother peter and his wife wherever they put me aside when you see the bible here on the services and the pharisees they were the two religious groups in the times of jesus so when that happened you'll notice that there was a great dissension amen amen so then we want to continue with the spirit continue and in the spirit in the spirit we we might say that a lot of people uh don't understand what the spirit is in the first place when god made man in athena when he created him he created him in his image now the image of god is not meant like it's a spirit man has the [Music] it looks just like a woman because the the part that we see right now is not the image of the god of god is spirit like now the sacrifice didn't believe that there was such a thing as angels nor spirits nor resurrection [Music] there wasn't a resurrection why do i want to come to jerusalem once a man dies that's that's it but we believe there is a resurrection we believe there is a spirit that was called and we also believe there is an angel now in this part this morning i want to deal with what we inherit as far as a nature or character of our parents because we understand that that a lot of times in church or wherever we are we we have problems and truthfully if you analyze the thing you you really don't have problems with anyone [Music] if you analyze it it's really your own personal problems maybe it comes through inheritance for an identity my father was a carpenter my father and to me there was no better carpenter in the world than my father one day i don't know how old i was because we used to help him [Laughter] and the lady was not pleased with the work that he had done and i already heard her say he did nothing but a mess i could have gone inside the home and choked that lady because i was protecting my father and my father and in my genes my father is i want you to notice and i'm going to go slow because it's going to be escalating the he says the whole human race is physical beings of our body is tearing down like that from eating high breed fruits [Music] tensions that ratner last you have to stop right here and meditate a lot of times we read and we have we we obtain a lot of head knowledge much and i have to know what that means before i can proceed to another verb but notice here it says that the brain cell is all also rot because of the hybrid [Applause] [Music] you know today it seems like the children uh the part meow the way i almost said like it seems like the children are smarter in a way they are [Music] [Music] of thinking because we are constantly hearing [Music] [Music] in other not one but this sister hears this other woman say that [Music] and she's not thinking right she doesn't have a thinking man's filthier [Music] so let me read this again does not all does not that also rock the brain cell get her two little children put him tie them with seat belts drive to the lake and send them into the lake tell [Music] can [Music] this is the way people think people can say a big lie in front of you and not better now they they live with some drugs and some things to be able to control their emotions and things and when a brain cell begins to rot the whole world not only this nation but everywhere mentally horrendous [Music] let me read again they'll imagine they're seeing ends the size of a mountain [Applause] [Music] women who are they tremendous but we should do the very best that we can to to receive in ourselves the very mess that we with long hair to turn to torment woman and the hair was given for recovery and if i could show you i'll show you the hair and you begin to cut a little bit of this off right a little bit from here you share a little bit from here all right here like woman hanging down and long teeth like a lion this is his brother these stingers in their tail my sister says i amen amen now prophet keeps on speaking and we'll we're going to go into these realms or these cycles say amen he said the inside of that man is a man or the inside of that man is a man called spirit and he has five senses and i would like to to do this and put in the realms that this is [Music] which [Applause] that's why the bible says now this spirit este espirito also has five sentences the he is [Applause] he actually is [Music] and it's impossible in an hour and a half that's what i'm going to say [Music] but it's impossible to cover the whole thing but let me let me go back a little bit [Music] now there is where many christians only stop with the same holy spirit [Music] [Music] today so confused about the evidence of the holy ghost and so forth satan can impersonate any kind of a gift he says but he cannot bring that word word by words [Applause] [Applause] is think a little bit [Applause] [Applause] [Applause] [Applause] [Applause] sleep i guess i have a nervous there's a nervous condition in my house i want to make sure when god spoke the word did you ever hear god speak the word and the gospel must first be published among all [Applause] [Applause] god wanted us [Applause] [Applause] [Applause] [Applause] that's the result and i believe it brought death phoenix arizona 1954. you can read a book where they're only bro is this a book it's in libra yes sir how many books do we find in here 66 yes so sometimes you can read a book when they're only broke [Music] brothers and the father himself which has sent me has borne witness of me you have neither heard his voice at any time nor seen his shape hallelujah stress that's right the spirit el espiritu when you speak when i speak we speak with a spirit if i'm upset if i want to kill somebody [Applause] they are [Applause] [Applause] he said he made him in the likeness of himself amen but now we hear aoraki when he speaks about how he takes us off the banister now i i i mentioned this message you have to walk the pilgrimage pathways you need a supernatural eye to [Music] is foreign [Music] this is what we [Music] and be able [Music] do you believe that he only knew william branham to be [Music] [Music] [Applause] he [Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] yes sir i'll call my little girl let's see christine ricky is that elsa yes so he knew er he was going to have some woman so he just made their spirit right there did he make a man did he make a woman no he made a man he saw a longer but he says in his pre-figure or in his imaginary mind oh then the imagination is okay if it has [Applause] his imaginary he saw a woman walking next to this man that's the reason it's another song that brother adams would say am i rambling i saw this woman with this man under that tree is [Applause] [Music] after the spirit [Applause] [Applause] right so the other part [Applause] he says now where do we find these fallen spirits [Music] are you with me [Applause] well this archangel thought that he was a better preacher than this other artist and no doubt that he was seen but god he didn't matter to god who was the best preacher [Applause] it isn't right that he has half of them [Music] [Applause] [Music] right yes sir [Applause] oh he was just talking about how what god man and what he was [Music] [Applause] [Applause] i have gone into where no one has gone in and i know how to bring people into existence when they worshiped him and what when i like to ask them if they follow jesus and they received baptisms even both these ones yes but it's not there they don't know where is that german life that's for what we're doing i believe it's numbers yes numbers 21. are you still with me numbers 21. when if god commissioned somebody to do something and you speak against that person who do you
