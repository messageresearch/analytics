opposed it oh that's the only way you'll be able to show the invisible what give the link amount up where most rather whose deadly missive Lee some months back I spoke on the god particle how many didn't remember that Uno's meses as I've read in a particular videos and and and we understood how man is trying to comprehend it all decomposed Columbus resident and there's a problem how God created everything come on keV you're searching for the building blocks who's kind of places look at all the water together become a frying to break down every molecule and atoms that I'm gonna contact our molecular ion and protons and neutrons molecular Z proton they down determine where they can see how it all came together on the planet ver como skate also frequent alone but they leave out what puts it all together pero lo que reckon a few days como como o que los troncos we understand better percent and demos that is the Word of God I put it all together chalo Kunta todo we understood them through this teaching a travesty sensing in sentence what had come out of this locus as they collide these particles together common cases particulars chakra man we found out that it was what what is produced is antimatter that you know depression and Iran team material and anti is anything that is opposed to that anti a solo design contra and we can touch it it's matter toll okay to come with material but then there's antimatter right antimatter hearing about it is that if those things ever come together here's a see you're gonna hold on they try they'll try to annihilate each other but not Italian Nicky Larson tells now this is something because you know they're looking for these in these experimentations and it was experimental scale something they're looking for something it was boost come and go but what got me was that the other day look at me captain me is when I was at left on the our trip and knock a sumo senator be a they they said they discovered something that was that they had loaded them for for over 80 years I'll go back I said yeah IV estar fuera de gente and they called it the angel particle they I'm on a particular language my God if I could get into that right now well you're going to try the name come but I'm gonna hold that one off there are aware that they never get so I'm going to connect that later on but it is point where connect that is with these angels that become man when it's just uncle is tiene más el hombre but we'll get that into another one I don't even get me started on that but there's a angel particle is the particular indicator that it has its own anti particle in it to propia ante particular has the same mass there is a proprietary I so as a regular particle homo quad care particular n is an opposite electric or magnetic property kinases propeller is magnetic and that if they would ever come at each other Casey Anthony and ikusabe don't try to annihilate each other so I'm not a funicular there are same things in the natural realm tambien patola in the zone whatever believers pero como we undreamed and and hemos what is going on in the spirit okay stay I want Osaka on in Los Feliz Wow I don't see it as there that is during Joe particle si la parte la particular I believe in angel particles are your Crayola part people I want you to get this now watch this now here okay captain ISM and in this en esto what they're trying to understand look at the content and there is the both sides of it it's uncle's mother Branham says from dilemma run and these days two sides this episode another Jenny does the three skip well parallel Vampirella know the original and region and the anti in auntie watch what he says you know take is coming around the corner now yeah under winter is kena anti auntie

time that came came on earth Paragon dope ngoi Sierra able came on earth a velvet on a Sierra one wants to annihilate the other oh no kanaky let a lot to I even Cain killed his brother can watch the anti now always together seasonal auntie talking about the time unisza tiem but Christ came on earth can you stop you know like the other who just came on earth who does you know no Sarah they're seeing something because they're messing around in the laboratory so focused on making this anniversary never worked side by side monolith ah matter/antimatter materia seem a particle/anti-particle what's equally I've ever seen is what brother man says if Einstein could have ever taken what he knew an emergency I said we're at the Milwaukee Savion applied it in the spirit yeah they're hopefully Connaughton co-star created world which Jesus forever to kill a model how close they are thing is equipment arequipa that's the face perilous paths all on offense you mix with a word or a mystical mother using their own understanding is loosen to proprietary man so like that they are destroying each other a poor SSN is doing and is destroying us out here in the physicals also rock I'm no

came report to a penis and the under energy score now some people say that it's false which is against not so I don't think it's false because I know it exists yourself or Kasich existing that they have recently detected the human can detect an invisible entities and then silence is invisible in our terrestrial environment and our ambient air without corrective action with a telescope with concave lenses for new telescope you with an equal lenses they said that they have evidence skin and evidence for the existence they like system of invisible terrestrial entities they ss SS they're terrific cosas secretary stays Casey Sam be end oh my goodness traces I gotta say that again that they have evidence then enemies are starting to pick up it's done in percent of Napoleon there the invisible entity exercise if you are simply siblings because the Antichrist for killing see please join if I can explain that it's like I know that this is Satan's line if the millennia is at an ass so very close until keeping our religious - I really feel so tambien here comes this this is this is the right line if there's a linear corrector watch they are also unfolding or revealing be invisible I mean the time travel and eluding be siblings I'm saying this for a reason now in the Tunisian Apollinaris on where we must we be don't the rhythm of the style we must be able to summon angels there was a surprise oh they're so angry let's go guy but how can you let you know something about the laboratory better commerce is not America Japan with a laboratory on in this NS dog this is what this is what gets me yes I look at makeup dummy butter brown says this any say I can find this in the manometer this esto we know that that the invisible is here time was killing the simulates a key for an unbeliever to set amongst people who'd be whose believers ruining clay look at the hinting thing and here's some time ago in Calgary Canada I kill a temple in Canada he's talking about the anti part now I'm not going to party Haneda and can even come visible give us a dc-3 many times have seen they look like big spiders the immigrant is big black shadows una sombras naked and I seen
