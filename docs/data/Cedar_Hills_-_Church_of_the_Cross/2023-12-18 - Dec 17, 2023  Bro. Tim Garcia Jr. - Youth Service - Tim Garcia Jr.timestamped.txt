[24:35] CR I've been wanting to say that to you
[24:36] guys for like two years
[24:38] but I'm happy I get to say that I've
[24:40] been telling my mom one time I was like
[24:41] put it on the shirt let's wear it to
[24:43] Camp let's do
[24:44] it work out that way but but uh I I we
[24:48] are part of you like my dad
[24:50] said this is our our home base and and
[24:53] we are an Annex at in Phoenix so I'm
[24:56] happy to be here with you
[24:58] um thank you brother brother Caleb for
[25:00] inviting me
[25:02] over I I was telling brother Caleb I was
[25:05] telling my dad I almost didn't make
[25:08] it uh we had some things going on uh
[25:11] yesterday I I work at a at a public
[25:16] school for those of you who don't know
[25:18] I'm just going to throw you some flowers
[25:19] my wife is a championship level
[25:21] basketball
[25:26] coach
[25:28] so yesterday we had a we had a
[25:30] championship
[25:33] tournament and then tomorrow we have
[25:36] some important things going on at work
[25:37] as
[25:40] well so I didn't think I was going to be
[25:42] able to
[25:43] come matter of fact I told Brother Caleb
[25:45] I like any weekend but the 17th I can't
[25:49] make it that
[25:52] week and then and then something
[25:55] happened you're going to probably think
[25:57] I'm kind of of like a zealot or maybe
[25:59] you're going to think I'm crazy maybe
[26:00] you're going to think I really doesn't I
[26:01] really don't care what you think
[26:05] but but I'm GNA tell you but I'm gonna
[26:08] tell you I Heard a
[26:10] Voice and and the voice was was
[26:13] literally was
[26:15] Audible and you say whatever you want I
[26:18] know I know what happened it was an
[26:20] angel speaking to
[26:23] me and it pricked my
[26:26] heart and The Voice told me if you're
[26:29] called you better
[26:32] go and I I try to rationalize it in my
[26:35] head I was like look I want to go I
[26:39] do I I I said I would
[26:42] anytime happen I said I said look here's
[26:45] what I told I told Brother Cale I
[26:47] said it's one thing to find the
[26:51] time it's quite another thing to make
[26:53] the
[26:54] time like so I'll make the time but just
[26:56] not that day
[27:00] um and so I kind of rationalized it like
[27:04] that and then that same voice spoke
[27:07] again and it said woe unto you if you're
[27:10] called and you don't
[27:14] go so how do you how do you ignore
[27:17] that you don't you you buckle up and you
[27:20] become obedient and you do whatever it
[27:25] takes and so and so after I made the
[27:27] commitment sorry I'm just going to warm
[27:28] up here a little bit with you if you
[27:29] don't mind after we made the
[27:32] commitment a couple things happened I
[27:34] got
[27:35] sick and let me tell you working in a
[27:38] public school I I work in a Cess pool of
[27:44] disease and if there was ever like a
[27:46] Superman immune system that's
[27:51] mine so I got covid a lot of us you know
[27:54] struggled with that but but the the
[27:56] basic the colds the flu lose all that
[27:58] that doesn't
[28:03] happen I was about to knock on wood but
[28:05] it's not thanks to the wood it's thanks
[28:07] to the Lord right so so thanks to the
[28:09] Lord I just don't get sick like
[28:12] that and and then when I got sick I lost
[28:15] my
[28:17] voice and then I went to work and there
[28:19] was something happened I had to suspend
[28:21] 14 kids in one
[28:25] day and then I checked the mail and I
[28:27] got a letter from the IRS from something
[28:29] like eight years
[28:36] ago I'm like what is all this going
[28:41] on why is all this happening
[28:47] right see
[28:49] uhhuh I caught you you dirty dog
[28:53] oh and uh and uh you know you know
[28:59] yeah it's funny um you know a lot of
[29:03] times like my dad said today sometimes
[29:04] when when the devil fights us we like to
[29:06] fight
[29:08] back and I'm like my dad in a couple
[29:11] little ways we we we're little guys so
[29:13] we're kind of we're kind of
[29:16] feisty and and and what I didn't know
[29:19] about myself that I'm learning about
[29:20] myself and learning about my dad is
[29:22] we're also kind of
[29:24] sensitive babies
[29:27] sorry Dad but we are man
[29:30] um and uh and but but anyway I don't
[29:34] know why I said that but all that to
[29:37] say in
[29:40] 1604 the king of England King James he
[29:42] commissioned the Bible to be
[29:45] translated
[29:47] James and part of what we used to fight
[29:50] back against the devil no doubt are the
[29:52] words that they that they the way they
[29:53] the vernacular the the the language that
[29:55] they used in 16004
[30:03] and it's very formal you know sometimes
[30:05] I used to wonder like I would wonder
[30:06] like do these guys like who who spoke
[30:09] like this who wrote like this like did
[30:10] they go home and like did they talk to
[30:11] their wives like
[30:14] that they're
[30:17] like oh the fair
[30:19] damsel thou Who treest The Gardens of my
[30:26] love like nowadays that would be
[30:32] like right and then they would I was
[30:34] like wondering like would they say like
[30:35] oh that thou would prepare me a meal
[30:38] wrapped in a blanket of
[30:42] ma and now we're
[30:45] like right and so and so I I say all
[30:49] that to say like sometimes we fight back
[30:50] with the way they spoke in
[30:55] 1604 and sometimes we fight back back
[30:57] with the way we speak in
[31:00] 2023 and so when I got
[31:03] sick I remembered a voice that I heard
[31:06] speak to
[31:07] me I said shut
[31:13] [Applause]
[31:16] up not only did I say shut up no but I a
[31:21] lot of things like we speak about now
[31:22] like back up off me
[31:26] man do g g i could have said get thee
[31:30] behind me Satan but I'm like bro back
[31:35] up ain't nobody got time for
[31:40] [Applause]
[31:42] that it was funny because let me tell
[31:44] you real quick we we were out of town
[31:46] and uh when I got sick and uh and my
[31:49] whole family was there they were having
[31:50] a great time and I I got so sick I went
[31:52] back to the
[31:56] hotel and then a lot of this stuff
[31:58] started to kick in and I started and
[32:00] then I remembered the
[32:03] voice and so I was like you know what
[32:05] forget
[32:09] you I'm gonna get my happy
[32:12] up no matter what I feel like I'm going
[32:15] go enjoy this time with my
[32:19] family so so here's what happens I you
[32:22] call me a zealot I don't care he told me
[32:24] to do it I'm going to do it so here's
[32:25] what I
[32:26] did I'm walking down street looking for
[32:29] my
[32:31] family and as soon as I start to feel
[32:34] sick shut
[32:36] up out loud like
[32:38] that I'm walking I'm walking by myself
[32:41] trying to keep my countenance from
[32:44] from like walking like shut
[32:48] up and there's people
[32:52] around lots of
[32:54] people like come here
[32:57] let the man
[33:00] pass don't make I
[33:04] contact because I just I'm just walking
[33:06] by myself I'm talking I'm like shut
[33:08] up back up and they're like he talking
[33:14] to so
[33:16] anyway that that's how I ended up
[33:19] here and and I I want to I want to share
[33:22] something with you
[33:23] today that no doubt you've heard over
[33:26] and over and over over and over and over
[33:29] again and so so what so what I want to
[33:31] share with you is nothing that nothing
[33:33] you're not going to say oh I never heard
[33:34] that
[33:37] before because because the fact is that
[33:40] there's nothing new that we could say
[33:41] and if I if I did try to say something
[33:42] new I no doubt would say it
[33:47] wrong and on that note I do want to
[33:49] preface everything that I
[33:53] say that if I say something contrary if
[33:57] I say something wrong to what your
[33:59] pastor Ministry has taught you you just
[34:01] tell me to shut
[34:05] up you put me to the side I don't want
[34:08] to be wrong I don't want to I don't want
[34:10] to be
[34:12] contradictory no doubt as human beings
[34:15] sometimes we say things
[34:17] wrong I make mistake you forgive me pray
[34:19] for me correct me and I I'm happy to
[34:25] learn Matthew
[34:29] 17 says blessed are you Simon
[34:34] barjon for flesh and blood has not
[34:36] revealed it to
[34:38] you but my Father which is in
[34:41] heaven and I say unto
[34:43] thee that thou are
[34:46] Peter and Upon This Rock I will build my
[34:50] church and the Gates of Hell shall not
[34:53] Prevail against
[34:55] it so theas reason why I'm telling you
[34:57] this is because although you've learned
[34:59] this before no
[35:04] doubt I am not expecting that I'm going
[35:07] to teach you something new
[35:09] today but rather hoping today will be
[35:12] the day that maybe for somebody the
[35:14] light
[35:18] bulb but we have to have a couple
[35:21] Baseline
[35:24] understandings first of all we have to
[35:27] all acknowledge that the Bible the word
[35:29] of God is our
[35:33] absolute I'm a teacher like I told you
[35:35] before so we're going to have a little
[35:36] bit of interaction especially with you
[35:37] people in the first three rows the B if
[35:39] the word of God is your absolute give me
[35:41] thumbs up
[35:44] please THS up if you don't have your
[35:46] thumbs up Bible is not your absolute
[35:47] that's okay just ignore everything that
[35:49] I say for the next however long
[35:52] I'm the if the Bible is your absolute
[35:54] then then we all acknowledge and agree
[35:56] that Jesus Jesus Christ is the same
[35:57] yesterday today and
[36:00] forever okay because we're going to put
[36:02] some basic things together but without
[36:03] those two basic foundational things then
[36:06] nothing I'm going to say to you is g to
[36:07] make any
[36:11] sense because the reality is that I or
[36:13] your pastor or the ministry here if we
[36:18] could we would take an idea we take a
[36:21] thought we would take a revelation and
[36:22] we'd plant it in your brains and allow
[36:23] it to have
[36:25] fruit
[36:29] but the law of God in Matthew 16 says
[36:32] that there's nothing that Flesh and
[36:33] Blood I cannot make you
[36:39] understand your intelligence your brain
[36:41] your flesh and blood cannot make you
[36:45] understand some day the Lord is going to
[36:49] decide that today is going to be your
[36:51] Revelation
[36:53] day okay so so to give you an examp
[36:57] example because it's easy for us to
[36:58] learn with
[37:01] examples let's all go back to when we
[37:03] were 8 n 10 years
[37:06] old when we were learning
[37:09] multiplication and we were learning the
[37:11] standard algorithm for multiplication
[37:12] how many of you guys remember
[37:14] that everybody doesn't remember but
[37:16] that's okay so those of us who remember
[37:18] we
[37:20] remember that our teachers taught us no
[37:23] doubt I taught this we multiply one's
[37:24] Place times the one's place
[37:29] the ones times the
[37:31] tens the ones times the hundreds and
[37:34] then you put a zero at the bottom and
[37:37] then you do the T times the on and then
[37:39] 10 times the 10 and then 10 times 100
[37:41] and then you put two zeros and then you
[37:43] keep going and then you and then you get
[37:45] to the end and then you have all these
[37:46] numbers at the
[37:50] bottom and then you add
[37:52] them and the kids are like add I thought
[37:55] we were multiplying
[37:58] why did I put these zeros there ain't no
[37:59] zeros in this number
[38:02] mister and we added the problems we
[38:04] added the
[38:06] numbers and the teacher asked you what'
[38:08] you
[38:10] get and you're like
[38:13] 14710 with the question at the end
[38:20] 14710 yeah and was like yes you got it
[38:23] good
[38:25] job and we like I got the answer right I
[38:28] don't I don't
[38:30] understand that's all right do it again
[38:34] we did the same thing blah blah blah
[38:36] blah blah put a zero now put two zeros
[38:38] now add them like okay and we're doing
[38:39] math like this because we really don't
[38:41] understand we're
[38:43] like okay okay and then I do it what'
[38:46] you
[38:46] get
[38:49] 848 yes you got
[38:52] it I got the answer right but I still
[38:54] don't
[38:55] understand and no doubt things like that
[38:57] happen in the spiritual
[38:59] right sometimes we do things and we
[39:01] might get things right but sometimes we
[39:02] really just don't
[39:05] understand well then one day you're
[39:08] doing the math you're doing math like
[39:11] this you still don't understand by the
[39:13] way this is like my eyebrows like
[39:14] pointing this way because I'm like
[39:18] confused so I don't understand and then
[39:20] one day you do the matth you're
[39:22] like
[39:25] oh I get it
[39:27] Mis Mis look it's because you do this
[39:28] and the reason why you do this is
[39:30] because of
[39:32] this give me another one give me another
[39:34] one oh I get
[39:36] it and you're like I've done been
[39:39] telling you that for the last two
[39:42] weeks but now you just got
[39:45] it why because because the law of God
[39:49] says that only the father can give
[39:54] Revelation matter what your teachers did
[39:57] only the only the Lord can give you
[40:00] Revelation it doesn't matter what your
[40:01] teachers
[40:02] do it doesn't matter how many times you
[40:05] do
[40:05] it it's in the Lord's time you're going
[40:09] to get the
[40:11] Revelation so I hope that maybe
[40:15] today oh somebody maybe somebody will
[40:19] understand okay so we just as as
[40:22] teachers as a teacher in the public
[40:24] education we just repeat repeat repeat
[40:25] repeat
[40:29] until the Lord decides to give you the
[40:32] Revelation so I'm going to ask you a
[40:34] couple
[40:35] questions and I'm going to ask for some
[40:38] participation I'm going to ask some of
[40:40] you to share out
[40:43] loud and I'm GNA ask some of you to
[40:46] stand and if you don't
[40:50] volunteer you will get volunt
[40:54] told I highly recommend man those of you
[40:56] especially if I know your
[40:59] name you say things out loud before you
[41:01] get called
[41:03] up and just like in school you had a
[41:07] good
[41:08] teacher not making eye contact is not
[41:10] going to be good
[41:12] enough call making eye contact because I
[41:16] know you're not trying to
[41:18] be all right um I told you guys that I
[41:21] Heard a
[41:22] Voice to me it was an angel speaking to
[41:25] me
[41:26] Supernatural and that's the title of our
[41:28] my thought today
[41:31] Supernatural so I'm going to ask you
[41:34] stand up
[41:36] if everybody doesn't have to stand up
[41:37] but if those of you in the front three
[41:39] rows you do need to stand
[41:41] up I'm GNA ask anyone who's willing able
[41:44] to stand up if you believe in
[41:52] Supernatural it would be hard to to to
[41:55] be a follower belever believer of this
[41:56] message if you
[42:00] didn't down so Supernatural is defined
[42:03] as a as a as a has a lot of
[42:06] definitions but but some of them are um
[42:09] things that are unexplainable by natural
[42:13] law pertaining to characterized by
[42:16] godliness by something of
[42:19] God pertaining to other unearthly
[42:24] beings in this case an
[42:26] Ang so I do have a question now for you
[42:29] I want to give you some time to
[42:33] think before you
[42:35] respond so I have a question here it
[42:38] is if you saw an
[42:41] angel with a
[42:43] Halo and
[42:45] wings
[42:47] glowing floating flying whatever you
[42:49] want to
[42:51] say what would you
[42:53] do put aside the fact
[42:58] that you probably
[42:59] faint pass out well I probably go to the
[43:02] dentist because I pass out and break my
[43:06] teeth that's not what I'm talking about
[43:08] in a perfect world if you could be
[43:09] prepared as prepared as you could
[43:13] be and you saw an
[43:21] angel what would you
[43:25] do
[43:31] somebody share out loud say something
[43:33] popcorn something what would you
[43:37] do hard to imagine but think about it
[43:40] put your head down in reverence I
[43:43] imagine you putting your head
[43:46] down what
[43:48] else
[43:51] pray what if that angel came with a Halo
[43:54] with wings floating
[43:56] and he spoke directly to
[44:02] you I have a message for
[44:06] Boaz now put your name in there for
[44:08] Boaz I have a message for fill in the
[44:11] blank with your
[44:13] name what would you
[44:17] do say
[44:20] again you would say speak your servant
[44:22] here is good and then you'd ask him yeah
[44:25] like tell me talk whatever you got to
[44:26] tell me tell me no doubt we wouldn't say
[44:28] well I don't have time because I got a I
[44:29] got
[44:30] a got a basketball game to go to
[44:33] so no doubt no doubt we would we would
[44:36] do that thank
[44:37] you what else would we do after that
[44:40] after we after we
[44:41] acknowledged doubt and
[44:43] reverence accepted that he was here to
[44:46] speak to us then what would we
[44:51] do ask
[44:54] questions you say you you have time to
[44:56] ask questions after the message what
[44:57] would you do while he's giving you his
[44:59] thoughts
[45:02] message what would you
[45:04] do check it with the
[45:06] word what else would we do we live in
[45:08] the 21st century boys and girls somebody
[45:10] falls on the side of the street I know
[45:11] what yall are doing so now tell me you
[45:13] see an angel what would you do record
[45:16] take a picture if you didn't have your
[45:18] phone what would you
[45:19] do take notes if you had a notebook what
[45:22] else would you do look around here
[45:24] there's I
[45:24] see we
[45:28] do we would look we would receive the
[45:31] message we would we would write it down
[45:33] we would record it oh my
[45:34] God and then what would we do with
[45:37] that we probably put it on Facebook
[45:40] trying to go viral with that Facebook I
[45:42] don't know viral you go Facebook on
[45:44] Facebook viral whatever you understand
[45:46] would would you would you share
[45:49] it okay if you feel like if an angel
[45:54] came spoke to me
[45:58] gave me a
[45:59] message that I would either record it
[46:03] write down my notes or some version of
[46:05] trying to
[46:07] encapsulate what he was telling
[46:10] me like you would do one of those things
[46:12] stand
[46:14] up you would either
[46:17] record or find the
[46:20] recording try to memorize everything
[46:22] that this angel said to
[46:24] me
[46:26] stand
[46:36] up good yeah I I find it I'm just gonna
[46:40] say I do find it hard to
[46:44] believe that if an angel showed up right
[46:47] here that we wouldn't do everything
[46:50] within our
[46:51] power to find evidence that that angel
[46:54] was actually there
[46:59] we don't have it up but don't we don't
[47:01] we in message churches put up every
[47:03] evidence that we have that picture of
[47:04] brother Brandman the Halo don't we take
[47:06] that picture everywhere in our Liv that
[47:09] that picture right
[47:10] there isn't that in every church because
[47:13] are we or are we not looking for
[47:14] evidence of the
[47:16] supernatural to if I had the wherewithal
[47:20] and I saw an angel
[47:22] speaking I would want to record it
[47:26] why because if he's given a message to
[47:28] me I want
[47:30] to is that true so I'm going to give you
[47:33] all an opportunity again it's kind of a
[47:34] loaded question but if you would do
[47:36] something like that to encapture what
[47:38] this Angel has spoken to
[47:42] you then then please stand
[47:45] up
[47:50] okay you see your your young people are
[47:54] standing every single one of them is
[47:56] standing they all took a little bit of
[47:59] coaxing but they did it
[48:04] yeah okay all right
[48:08] um can we open up our Bibles
[48:11] please we're going to read uh 1 Samuel
[48:19] 3:4 I read the scripture to you once
[48:23] before and I I love uh uncle uncle L
[48:27] back there I love his trombone baritone
[48:30] Voice last time I read the scri with
[48:33] with a different
[48:36] purpose but the scripture is
[48:44] compound so we're going toh share a
[48:47] different message that we're going to
[48:48] learn from this scripture
[48:50] hopefully 1 Samuel 3:4 says and the Lord
[48:53] called Samuel and he answered answered
[48:55] here am
[48:58] I all right all right somebody the first
[49:01] three R who was
[49:04] speaking it literally explicitly says in
[49:07] there and the Lord called
[49:09] Samuel so who was speaking Lord say it
[49:12] again who was speaking one more time who
[49:15] was speaking the Lord was speaking so if
[49:18] you're taking notes right there in your
[49:19] notes if you have a notebook write in
[49:21] your notebook 1st Samuel 3:4 the Lord is
[49:24] speaking
[49:26] and then if you're taking notes and you
[49:27] have lined paper skip a
[49:29] line because we're going to come back to
[49:31] that and then we're going to go to our
[49:33] next scripture
[49:35] it's I am not even giving you any time
[49:37] brother I'm just running through you're
[49:39] awesome thank you sorry about that
[49:41] Hebrews
[49:46] 37 give you some time to cut
[49:49] there I'm going to start reading it says
[49:52] wherefore as the Holy Ghost saith today
[49:56] if you will hear his
[50:00] voice Harden not your
[50:03] hearts as in the
[50:05] provocation in the day of
[50:08] Temptation in the
[50:09] wilderness when your fathers tempted
[50:13] me proved me and saw my
[50:17] works all right same question who is
[50:21] speaking what does it say Hebrews 37
[50:24] what does it say
[50:26] who sayith say louder please the Holy
[50:29] Ghost so right there right next to that
[50:31] scripture not in you don't have to write
[50:33] in your Bibles but in your notes please
[50:34] write down the Holy Ghost is
[50:38] speaking so in the 1st Samuel 3:4 who is
[50:42] speaking in the Hebrew scripture who
[50:44] speaking now we are a message believing
[50:48] church I don't have to prove to you that
[50:49] the Holy Ghost and the Lord are one and
[50:51] the
[50:53] same Amen to that
[50:57] okay good so now so now here is the uh
[51:01] look the the burden of proof when when a
[51:02] minister comes up is is here
[51:07] right if we can show you here we can
[51:09] show you in the
[51:11] message I I dare to ask how many
[51:14] examples do we need to
[51:16] give for something to
[51:20] click but I'm gonna give you two
[51:24] examples so follow with me so Hebrews
[51:27] 3:79 it says wherefore as the Holy Ghost
[51:31] saith today if you will hear his
[51:34] voice Harden not your
[51:37] hearts as in the
[51:38] provocation in the day of Temptation in
[51:41] the
[51:42] wilderness when your fathers tempted me
[51:46] Pro me saw my
[51:48] Works who is
[51:51] speaking the Holy Ghost thank you now
[51:54] let me ask ask you the question of the
[51:57] Dayal question ask again before I do who
[52:01] is speaking the Holy Ghost is
[52:05] speaking what did his holy ghost voice
[52:08] sound
[52:14] like that's the essential
[52:17] question we can see that it says the
[52:19] Holy Ghost says I know who is
[52:22] speaking what did the voice sound like
[52:27] if you want to answer to that one let's
[52:29] turn to Psalms
[52:36] 957 Psalms 95 7-1
[52:40] says for he is our
[52:43] God and we are the people of his
[52:46] pasture and the Sheep of his
[52:49] hand today if you will hear his
[52:52] voice Harden not your hearts as in the
[52:55] the
[52:56] provocation as in the day of Temptation
[52:59] in the
[53:00] wilderness when your fathers tempted me
[53:02] and saw my
[53:05] work remind me again who said
[53:08] that the Holy Ghost right remember
[53:11] Hebrews who said that it was a quote
[53:15] Paul was
[53:16] quoting he was quoting the Holy
[53:19] Ghost my question to you
[53:22] now
[53:24] people
[53:26] what did the voice sound
[53:31] like it sounded like
[53:35] David who wrote the
[53:38] Psalms who wrote them David so so the
[53:43] Holy Ghost spoke but what did the voice
[53:45] sound
[53:47] like who it sounded like
[53:51] David what was
[53:53] David he was a king he was a prophet he
[53:56] was a man who who was
[53:59] speaking
[54:01] David excuse me who was
[54:03] speaking the holy ghost that you cannot
[54:06] you cannot mess that up like I just
[54:09] did you cannot messed that up who was
[54:12] speaking the Holy Ghost what did the
[54:15] voice sound like sounded like
[54:18] David is that in the Bible or not is the
[54:21] Bible the
[54:22] absolute is the Bible the Supreme
[54:25] Authority in our
[54:27] life so the Holy Ghost
[54:30] spoke and it sounded like
[54:33] David good write that down now the voice
[54:36] sounded like
[54:38] David Hebrew scripture where I told you
[54:39] to skip a line now we're going to go
[54:40] back to
[54:41] Samuel because you know why we think
[54:44] about
[54:45] David and and I asked my son one time I
[54:47] asked that son who's
[54:51] David he said that he's a character from
[54:53] the
[54:54] Bible and no doubt many of us would
[54:56] probably answer like that he's a
[54:57] character from The
[54:59] Bible Goliath he was a king he did all
[55:01] these amazing
[55:03] things but you know it's crazy because
[55:08] if we were to read the biography of
[55:10] Martin Luther King
[55:13] Jr Martin Martin Luther King I would ask
[55:17] you who's ketta Scott
[55:18] King I would ask you who is ketta Scott
[55:21] King ketta Scott King how many of us
[55:24] would say she's a character from the
[55:25] story of Martin Luther
[55:28] King Luther King we
[55:30] wouldn't say she was a
[55:33] woman she was married to Martin Luther
[55:35] King
[55:37] Lu if this is real
[55:40] life we take that character in The Bible
[55:43] vernacular from our from our
[55:46] language David was a prophet David was a
[55:50] King David was a man and sorry to tell
[55:53] you what the Holy Ghost spoke through
[55:54] that
[55:56] man okay so so to me it's a lot easier
[55:59] to see the connection with with this
[56:01] with the Samuel verse so we're going to
[56:02] come back to that when now let's go back
[56:03] to 1st Samuel
[56:07] 3:4 and it said the Lord called
[56:11] Samuel and he
[56:13] answered here am I and he ran unto
[56:18] Eli and he said here I
[56:21] am you called
[56:23] me
[56:27] so let me ask you a
[56:29] question who was
[56:32] speaking don't don't say Samuel wasn't
[56:34] Samuel speaking who was speaking the
[56:37] Lord was speaking this say the Lord
[56:40] called the Lord who was
[56:42] speaking say it again loud who was
[56:45] speaking boys and girls what did the
[56:48] voice sound
[56:49] like it sounded like
[56:52] Eli and who was Eli wo who was
[56:57] he he was the high priest and you want
[57:00] to bring it home he was Samuel's
[57:05] Pastor who was he he was Samuel's
[57:13] Pastor is Jesus Christ the same
[57:15] yesterday today and forever or
[57:18] not how many of you know what 1+ 1 is 1+
[57:21] 1 equals 2 and you have the revelation
[57:25] and no doubt if I try to tell you 1 plus
[57:26] one makes
[57:28] 11 you wouldn't take that you couldn't
[57:30] you would not accept that because you
[57:31] know because you have the Revelation get
[57:33] the revelation of this today boys and
[57:37] girls because the voice of the Lord to
[57:40] me because I have the Revelation to
[57:44] me sounds like our
[57:48] [Applause]
[57:51] pastor 1956 June 17th Revelation book of
[57:56] symbols paragraph
[57:59] 58 Prophet
[58:01] said when he stands here on the
[58:06] platform ministering the word of
[58:09] God he is God's angel to the
[58:13] church now we have
[58:15] problems and we say Lord Show Me A
[58:18] Sign Lord Send Me an Angel to speak to
[58:21] me in 2023 the Lord said I sent you a
[58:24] whole angel
[58:28] already I didn't send him your
[58:31] way but we would rather hear uh we would
[58:34] rather hear an angel with wings in the
[58:37] Halo I'm going to call you out now
[58:38] you're either going to eat your words or
[58:40] you're going to eat the word
[58:42] today because I had to I had to coax you
[58:45] but you all stood up you all stood up I
[58:48] did not make you stand up now we would
[58:51] rather hear an angel with wings than a
[58:53] Halo and we what did we say we said we
[58:55] would take it we would share it we would
[58:57] show it we would read it we' we we'd go
[59:00] over and over and over we'd take it
[59:04] in
[59:06] 197 October the six questions and
[59:11] answers which has the greatest
[59:14] Authority an angel from
[59:17] heaven or an angel at the
[59:20] pulpit which has
[59:22] it somebody guess
[59:26] brother brandham answered it somebody
[59:27] guess go
[59:29] ahead the angel at the
[59:33] pulit sorry to say but when you're
[59:36] Pastor not just the
[59:40] pastor brother brandham says if you are
[59:45] spirit-led by God you become a messenger
[59:48] of
[59:50] God angel God's
[59:53] messenger outside inside of you is
[59:56] physical but the inside of you is
[1:00:00] Supernatural and God sent you
[1:00:03] Supernatural
[1:00:06] gifts he sent you a
[1:00:08] pastor but he sent you an
[1:00:11] Apostles and
[1:00:13] evangelists and
[1:00:14] pastors and teachers these are gifts
[1:00:18] from God for
[1:00:20] you for your
[1:00:22] edification for your perfection and I
[1:00:25] promise you once you can capture this
[1:00:29] Vision capture that
[1:00:31] Revelation you can never ever again be
[1:00:34] the
[1:00:35] same and let me let me tell
[1:00:37] you when the pastor
[1:00:40] speaks when brother Tim speaks to me
[1:00:43] when Uncle L speaks to
[1:00:45] me when the ministry comes up in here
[1:00:47] and speaks to
[1:00:48] me I don't see Uncle Caleb I don't see
[1:00:52] Uncle I don't see Uncle l
[1:00:56] I'm sorry but I'm
[1:00:58] it the voice that spoke to me it said
[1:01:00] woe unto you if you don't
[1:01:02] go it was his voice right there raising
[1:01:05] his hand God told me wo unto you if you
[1:01:08] don't go so here I
[1:01:10] am because full
[1:01:13] obedience the word of God entitles you
[1:01:16] to the
[1:01:18] Tok and that's the sign of full
[1:01:21] obedience Revelations 1:3 says
[1:01:25] apyp blessed is he forget that change it
[1:01:32] blessed is Tim Garcia
[1:01:35] j blessed is Tim Garcia
[1:01:38] j he
[1:01:40] reads and he hears the words of the
[1:01:44] prophecy he keeps the things that are
[1:01:46] written there
[1:01:48] in what does that mean to me it says
[1:01:50] blessed is him that reads hears and
[1:01:53] obeys
[1:01:56] and you know what we come to we come to
[1:01:58] the ministry with
[1:02:00] issues and they give us we come to them
[1:02:03] because they're the Lord's Angels sent
[1:02:04] to
[1:02:06] us and I'm sorry go unto me if I go to
[1:02:10] him with a
[1:02:11] problem he tells me exactly the steps I
[1:02:14] need to
[1:02:17] take why because it's God's voice
[1:02:22] speaking it sounds like these men
[1:02:26] here understand something please that he
[1:02:29] might ask me or tell me to do
[1:02:31] something although I did not understand
[1:02:34] how I was going to be here
[1:02:37] today understanding is not a
[1:02:40] prerequisite for
[1:02:45] obedience it does not say that I am the
[1:02:48] author of Eternal salvation for all
[1:02:50] those who
[1:02:53] understand
[1:02:56] it says I am the author of Eternal
[1:02:58] salvation for all those that
[1:03:01] believe and if I believe this
[1:03:04] book I know Jesus Christ is the same
[1:03:07] yesterday today and
[1:03:09] forever know that those
[1:03:12] voices although they sound like men that
[1:03:15] I know and
[1:03:18] respect when they are inspired of the
[1:03:20] Holy
[1:03:22] Ghost God's voice speaking

[1:35:26] William and they are both doing
[1:35:30] great you might see you know there's a
[1:35:32] few few wires there don't get
[1:35:36] worried everything is
[1:35:38] great that there as we heard is to help
[1:35:43] them but um you know they they were born
[1:35:46] when they were born they they were 2 lb
[1:35:48] 2B 15
[1:35:50] ounces

[1:36:47] incubator Elijah is still on the
[1:36:49] breathing machine but he's at the lowest
[1:36:56] levels so he's not too far
