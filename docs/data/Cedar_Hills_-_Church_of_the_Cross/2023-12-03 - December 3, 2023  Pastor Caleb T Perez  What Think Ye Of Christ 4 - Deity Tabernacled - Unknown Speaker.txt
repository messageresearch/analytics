anyone that's new here we don't believe in baptizing children because there is no scripture for that but we [Music] do present them to the Lord and brother Tommy says we not only present them we dedicate and so in the book of St Luke the second chapter good St Luke 2: 21 when eight days were accomplished for the circumcising of the child his name was called Jesus which was so named of the Angel before he was conceived in the womb when the days of her purification according to the law of Moses were accomplished they brought him to Jerusalem to present him to the Lord it is written in

father it is a gift from you and what they do Lord and how they raise her Lord is their gift back to you so as we bring little to you Lord father we present her to you for a life of service Lord a dedicated life father that she would be an example Lord if you would T an example Lord that she would be the face of her generation May her parents raise her in the admonition of the Lord and may she never leave your ways Lord let her life be an example and show that you not only are a God that saves but you are also a God that can keep a person Lord keep her from all harm from all evil that would come to her Lord we present her we dedicate her to you at this moment and we say Lord behold your hand me Lord bless her Lord now in her life may it be fruitful Lord Jesus for your honor and For Your Glory in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen amen what baby okay God bless you all amen would you stand now as we as we get into the word there's not anybody here that is in a hurry is there are they nobody left their fres going all right okay let's get into the word let's see if you all remember the freeold purpose it's been over a month I think that I've since I preached let me see number one to reveal himself in Christ number two to have preeminence in his bride three rest the kingdom I want to just tell you this before we get going in the 1970s I don't know who the minister was but uh this this older Minister he told our founding pastor this if you can ever fully understand Christ is the m mystery of God revealed you're close to home that's how important this message is we are close to home so let's let's pray that God would open up our understanding Matthew chapter 22 verse 41- 46 I'm sorry I'm just going to read 41 and 42 Matthew 22 when you have it you can say amen and while the Pharisees were gathered together Jesus asked them saying what think ye of Christ whose son is he they say unto him the son of David now we know that we know that that Christ means help me the anointed one or this is number four already the anointed one or the Messiah very good may God add His blessings to the reading of his word you may be seated amen and amen amen I was thinking about all these babies these babies being born and uh this scripture this scripture came to me and I and it just began to work in me and uh so if we can be so you can be so kind to open your Bibles to the Book of Job the 38th chapter we're going to read verses 1 through 4 when you have it you can say amen and the Lord answered job out of the Whirlwind and said who is this that darkeneth counsel by words without knowledge I believe that this is this question is being asked to every one of us who is this that darken counsel I'm going to stop for a moment here because what it's really asking here who is this that is withhold holding light from my plan my advice my purpose who's this that's darkening the counsel who's this that's keeping light from from reaching my plan or my advice and they're doing it by words but they're words without knowledge words words that have no life to back it up such as I I Love You Lord and God says you tell me that with your lips but your hearts are far from that verse three says G up now thy loins like a man I believe that the only ones that can truly uh answer this question are those that have reached the stature of a perfect man for I will demand of thee and answer thou me we are living in a time now that he is demanding an answer from us where was thou when I laid the found foundations of the earth declare if thou Hast understanding when the morning Stars sang together and all the sons of God shouted for Joy my question to you is where were you so ask your neighbor that question where were you neighbor you're not at no some of you did in other words you know you got to get into it a little bit here where were you when the sons of God shouted for Joy ask your neighbor again where were you when the sons of God shouted for joy and not just some of the [Music] sons the Bible says where were you in all the sons of God shout for Joy what think you of Christ who son is he where were you when all the sons of God shouted for Joy you can begin to see more and more why brother brandham says that your decision on this scripture and what this scripture is asking it will seal your Eternal destination why because if you don't know by a revelation whose son he is then you'll never know whose son you are is that right come on now each one of you want to know who son you are we're either his son or we're the other guy's sons and if you don't know whose son you are you'll never be able to answer that question where were you I want to know where I was amen everybody hereall hold on a second can everybody just bow their heads for a moment Jesus name Lord tou our brother oh the enemy just wants to disrupt Lord but but Lord you are in control in Jesus name Satan you take your hands off him at this moment believe it we're in a battle is that right we're in a battle he wants to interrupt that's okay we ain't backing down that's for sure he doesn't want us to know who we are doesn't want us to know whose son we are he doesn't want us to know where we were from the beginning it gives us such a such a joy to know that God cares about us now your neighbor God cares about us neighbor amen and we are answering these questions no other time in history has there ever been a people that are so sure about who they are said right now this is the time church this is the time that that we have been placed here on Earth and that's why this scripture kept coming back to me and I would read it and then it kept coming back to me and I would say what what's the purpose of this of this coming to me but then it began to make so much sense why was there so much joy in Heaven Come On Church why was there so much joy why did you shout in the beginning we got to know why we shouted because if we know why we shouted back then then we're going to know why we're shouting today now how many of you know why we shouted in the beginning how many want how many of you know why all the sons of God shouted imagine the the joy that was there that's why Jesus said the glory that I had with you from the beginning the prophet of God tells us exactly why we were shouting are you ready are you ready now you you know this you've heard it before he says but those shining ones shouted for Joy when they seen that someday they were going to be tabernacled here on Earth oh my my I'm going to say it again say it again they shouted for Joy because they knew that one day they were going to be tabernacled here on Earth that's why this came to me I was talking to brother brother Jerry and sister Faith and they said the babies they coming a little soon they're right on time why because they they're they're ready if you could see your children they're they're excited their spirit is so excited because they were they're getting ready to be Tabernacles hallelujah hallelujah I'm going to say now if we were if we were shouting for Joy why are we still not shouting why have we lost our shout when we're going through hard times and things don't turn out the way we want just remember we shouted at one time now we are Tabernacle it should be a joy that's why Paul would say I counted a joy I fall into diverse Temptations and and whatever I go through it's a joy for me he knew he had shouted in the beginning now now notice this now how many of you are are excited that you Tabernacle there may be a lot of people going through a hard time that there's nothing to shout about they say shout come on I'm G to say it again find your Shout it's so important where's our shout this morning we are here right now aren't we oh come on now I'm going to say it again we're here ain't we and we're serving the lord and we're waiting for the coming of the Lord then we should shout this morning say than thank you Lord we are Tabernacles and we're going to get to something good here in a moment I thought of these children and I said their time has come to be manifested and you feel you feel for them in one sense it's a rough time to come into this world but at the same time it's the most glorious time oh I could just see their their little Spirits getting excited we're going to be tabernacled just in a moment and I can just see those babies and when they came out and that Spirit joined together with that body and they began to scream let me interpret their screams when all we hear is I'm hearing I'm Tabernacle and how much more should it be when we have come to a new birth and we know that that that we are sons of God tell your neighbor I'm Tabernacle that's the name of my of my of my that's my subtitle deity Tabernacle but it's not only us that has tabernacled Christ must be tabernacled in us a little while and the world seeth me no more but you shall see me for I will be with you even in you to the end of the world of the ages now that's why the first part of the Rapture is the shout everybody's looking for a Rapture I'm going to tell you we're already in the Rapture the shout has come forth a message of preparation it has produced a bride that knows who she is how many people know who they are come on now you got to know this if you don't know who you are s Satan will put a little sucker in your mouth and we'll be down in the dumps all the time if you don't get your shout back there is no Rapture not for you not for me I got to get my shout back it's time to let voices ring it's time to speak with authority yes or yes I'm GNA say it again it's time to speak with authority in the message the Lamb's Book of Life it says brother says use faith faith which is revelation is is the boss anybody you got faith here come on now how many of you have faith faith is the boss that's right faith has hairs on its chest and he go brother I mean uh it's got big muscles when it speaks all the worries drop one side to the other and the devil say now you just can't make it you can't do this you're ashamed to testify and Faith raise up and say shut up oh wait a minute I I I I didn't say this he said Faith would raise up and say shut up oh we're all politically correct nowadays that's not a the way a Christian should talk isn't that the way it is today all these new parents no you can't spank children you got to talk to them wow that's a day and age we live in but but but here he's saying Faith raise up and say shut up I got the floor no no no no I don't know if you're getting it or not there's got to be an authority behind what you say shut up I got the floor amen amen who is this that darkeneth counsel with words without without knowledge who's talking to me you know what I'm talking about you hear it all the time right try to do good enough her and you get all the and people are like I get these thoughts and I hear these voices in my head what is what are these voices words who is this that darkeneth who's this that's pulling light away you can see God's plan in your life who is this that darkeneth counsel there are people in here that are dealing with family that are telling you that the message is false come on you know who I talking about is that right that message you guys follow is false who is this that darkeneth counsel with words without knowledge who is this come on church this morning you got to recognize the the enemy at every turn who is it that's telling you in your ear that that halo over brother Bram that's that's just a hoax a hoax I've seen it what are you going to tell me that it don't exist I've seen it what are you going to tell me that that that the the cloud didn't happen I was there hallelujah hallelujah what do you mean you're if you only knew you're just you're just anointed by a spirit that is darkening the counsel with words without knowledge it's funny though how all of a sudden they become an expert and they know nothing about the supernatural we get to something here in a moment so what do you do listen to them this is the craziest thing uh I didn't want to hurt their feelings well they sure don't care if they hurt yours but Faith isn't talking to the person faith is talking to the spirit that's anointing them to come against what you believe okay I'm not saying shut up to the person I'm saying it to the spirit that's there now notice this now here we here we go for a moment now when we see this it's it's it's beautiful what are they going to tell us about all this faith has big muscles deity the do dying to dwell inside you this is what we're we want to get across this this this morning we have to stop living in an age that has gone by that's the mistake we make we're living in the glare of another Age come on Church we're living in the glare of another age living back here we live under Hope and and Lord please and and instead of speaking with authority what do we do we don't realize that deity wants to be Tabernacles I'm going to say it again deity dying to be Tabernacle as much as you wanted to come and be tabernacled deity also wants to come notice this now don't desecrate the temple no don't desecrate the Tabernacle deity wants to Tabernacle but it can't as long as you desecrate the temple this is the synonyms of the word desecrate it means to violate it profane treat sailly treat with disrespect it means to pollute it to contaminate infect it in befoul it defile it dease degrade dishonor blashe against vandalize damage destroy def face those are all synonyms of Des and it's time to stand up for the truth and let your faith say shut up that that doesn't sound good but oh well fill in the blank right some of you are offended by already I already knew I know I know how he speaks and I say shut up not to you to the spirit that's trying to darken the council where we're at there is no Darkness the light has come the message has unfolded the mystery have opened up we're not in darkness we have received the light of life and therefore we can say Satan you and your minions shut [Applause] up I okay all right I don't know some some people get they get offended that's okay watch this now can't you see it the same Antichrist Spirits from the Lucifer was against Christ yes see he was against Michael brother Brown says Michael is Christ and I believe that in the beginning while onethird of the Angels were being deceived our Angels stood up [Applause] and I'm going to say it again in the beginning when there was war in heaven our Angels stood up and said yeah that's right I might get in trouble but that's okay they did it back then and we'll do it again when those Fallen Angels come and tell you you're going to die what are we going to tell them shut up I can't die oh come on when they say you're following a cult shut up I'm following Christ are you with me this morning when they tell you there's no hope for your children they're lost please quiet down that doesn't work the promise is me and my children you don't say shut up to be grer you say you say shut up because it's you're you're too much noise going on when when they were on Mount Transfiguration tell us brother Jim when when Peter says let's build three tabern and and what did the voice say come on now brother Bram says that right let's build three Tabernacles before he could even start or finish the voice interrupted him who is this that darkeneth counsel this is my beloved Son what think he of Christ whose son is he God says this is my beloved Son hear ye him well your marriage is doomed I'm telling you this because you all know what you go through I get so sick and tired of the enemy pulling one over our eyes and making us feel like we're worthless and we're usel this and we're nobody why don't you just give up and kill yourself do you entertain those thoughts got to say shut up I may have done some mistakes but I'm still a son of God when they tell you you weren't one of those that shouted for Joy shut up I'm here ain't I come on church I'm [Applause] here and I'm shouting so shush I don't know about you but I get tired of that in the message ashamed it gots to like looks like when you pray for people that you apologize um Mr devil would you please move over and let me brother Braham says faith has got big muscles and when Faith speaks everything else shuts up I keep hearing these what because you're you're not speaking by faith you're not speaking with Revelation you're speaking words without knowledge but when you can start to speak with by Revelation Church immediately everything shuts up why cu the boss is in town don't go in uh Mr devil can you move out he says get out of here what you tell him get out of here Son of God commissioned of God leave them alone that moves in you have no apology to the devil nothing to do with him we're not ashamed of the word not ashamed of our commission not ashamed of who we are let's quit with our Pico down all the time wa uh because because things just didn't go the way we thought wow you're living in the glare of another age I hope things change this age perfect faith not perfect Hope come on now I'm I'm I'm trying to get to the core of all this where do we live we can talk a good talk but do we have the authority behind it let's find out where we're supposed to be we live in an every changing world and the only thing that does not change is is God's word Roger is that your Mama Rogers Mama God bless how nice to have you we live in this everchanging world it seems to get harder and harder I'm going to hit home here it seems because I I talk to people all the time and I get the same response listen closely uh it seems harder and harder to get an answer from God am I talking to anybody I prayed about this brother I prayed and I fasted and I prayed and and I I don't get an answer and it seems like the more I pray the more silent God is am I talking to anybody here no well either you don't feel like that or you're not praying one of the two let me see your hands if you pray something he just no I just I can't get an answer have you desecrated the temple in some way you're trying to get God to meet you with a desecrated Temple you know I I stop for a moment here because I we have an altar here and and at times people come to the altar nothing wrong with the altar this is but it's just like a symbol right it's a type the real altar is in your heart but let me ask you this question how many of you have ever come to the altar not to ask for anything but to come to the Altar and just offer him something and just say Lord I'm here I don't need you I just need you but I want to praise you and I want to glorify you I come bringing my offering my gift to the that's it Lord anybody ever come like that usually we come to the altar Lord I need this Lord I need that like he doesn't know what we need that's why after a while we don't hear I'm getting to something here that's why we don't get nothing we cry Lord Lord we cry Jesus Jesus and we don't get an answer I guess the Lord doesn't love me you ever desecrated your temple come on husbands and wives you ever speak to each other each other with profanity you're not only profaning your temple but her Temple that's right let me see no no no come on now be honest you ever Dishonored your vows it's important that we've tabernacled have you disrespected one another have you ever abused your spouse gotten physical or uhoh the shut up good because we got to take inventory right now we are close to the coming of the Lord Church what are we doing have you vandalized the Tabernacle by breaking each other's hearts come on church members how you treated one another or another brother and sister with disrespect come on these are all desecrations have you ever contamin contaminated someone else's Temple by dumping trash on them because not only your Tabernacle but their tabernac if we have we'll answer to God but God Made A Way that if we have failed in those things there still is Mercy and Grace today I don't know about tomorrow but if you find yourself somewhere here do something about it today are you with me want to hit home why those Devils they don't want they want to interrupt as I was pondering this I said Lord why is it that so many just I hear the same thing why is it that that you seem silent to many this is the word of the Lord that he gave to me as I was talking to him as I was talking to him I heard him say this are you ready listen listen he said I went down to rescue them but now it's time for them to come to where I am always expecting him to come to you to when are you going to come to him he already came to you he already stretched down his hand for you he already saved you but now he want wants you as he became us for us to become him now where do we live do we still live in Luther's age Wesley's agey Pentecostal age no come up higher church we have been invited to come up higher notice notice this is what he says the reason they don't get the answers that they're looking for is because they are not meeting me in my only provided place of worship in Christ that's the Revelation today and you ain't going to meet him any other way under any other Revelation but Christ is the Myst he said and unless they come into Christ their position I will not meet them any other place he goes on and says tell them that I no longer am winking at their ignorance I am requiring each one to give an account for their thoughts their words their decisions their action there's no longer an excuse for being ignorant for the message has been given the Myster is revealed and that's why they must get my word in them thus say still with me Church making us dig deep you you can't even turn on the the news and you see 50 volcanoes erupting at the same time 50 volcanoes at the same time what is it birth pains the world wanting to put forth another A New Earth but at the same token his bride bringing forth the word we look at this floods and Wars everywhere we turn trouble on every on every turn but amidst it all our focus is not on that our focus should be on him we can't make it on the pastor's coil you can't make it on your Mama and Daddy's coattail come on church we just like to make it the easy route not no more you got to have your own [Music] experience how many of you believe that the Holy Ghost is Christ sure absolutely the message testimony of a true witness he says deity God tabernacled in man it's more than a sensation this is where we miss it we come to church we get a sensation really got it now and tomorrow you're back in the dump what did you get come on ask yourself the qu what did I get it's a question it's more than a sensation more than speaking in tongues it's more than shouting in the spirit it's more than weeping it's more than joining the church God living in man God himself tabernacled in that person when he can speak and it's just the same as God speaking that's the Church of Jesus Christ that's the way the First Apostolic Church Church went forth do we expect anything less that's not our priority that's why we're sitting in church and we're falling asleep right why not our priority oh this is not the message you thought I was going to PR going to help you this against nobody I'm not mad at nobody not at the Devil what Satan wants is discredit Christ all he needs to do is get you to doubt one word that Spirit of antichrist is so subtle a deceptive that even if you have thoughts that part of this Bible is not true how many believe every word that's here even if you were to have a thought that one word was not true then the spirit that's in you not because Christ is the word we're excited about a lot of things right something one person does something in church and everybody does it oh come on you act like I I don't know what I'm talking about next thing you know everybody's at Cold plant it's a good thing a good thing did you hear that sisters at the gym oh oh if you all could see the faces I get see where he's going with this you got some of you give me the funniest faces but is it not true next thing you know all the sisters in church are going to the gym and little by little then one starts putting on a her little tight little things you call then well I guess it's okay she did it you are so far from the it's always let's see who can do something better and then the next thing that's all we care about the next day oh I got to go gym oh like like oh that's something big take care of your children first te them about Jesus come on now get the word inside of you brother you don't know I hear the message while I'm while I'm jogging that's problem but the funny thing about all this and I want you to hear me closely the funny thing about all this is that the more you do that the colder you become in church and then you don't raise your hands no and then you don't sing no more and no more specials because now you get taking care of the the temple right you got to take it care of it from the inside out what's the problem church is that the things of the world were too Earthbound so we care about looking good brother 84 cents really nice nails nice suit oh put a lot of money into this nice chain yeah and your inner the Flor come on you know it's true and the colder and the colder people become they left their first love they look forward to the gym instead of looking forward to I can put on a message and listen and praise God next thing you know it you're out smoking pot with everyone else I letting those just we those are times you don't have to run I'm not even going to go any more on that I think you get that you get what the Holy Ghost is they're trying to be like I got to put BX next thing you knowx how old are you I'm 80 cuz we're afraid to get old right we're afraid I got to do that yeah oh come on you you know those things mean more to you at times and you can't do that those Spirits are so SL me the last time you told somebody come to my house we can pray together and and let's let's break through struggling with my children me and my husband are having a hard time can you pray with me instead we get around people leave him leave her wow and we're Christians God have mercy on us let's go on let's go on here notice this now Matthew 24:23 then if any man shall say unto you Lo here is Christ or there believe it not 2423 for there shall arise false christs notice that does not have a small sea it has a capital sea there shall arise false Christ and false prophets there shall arise notice now how many christs are there bunch of anointed preaches anointed ones at the end you know why he says ones because everybody thinks that there's one big Christ and a bunch of small Christ running around our founding Pastor would say I don't believe in little Christ I Believe In Christ and we are part of Christ God did not have a bunch of christs God had one Christ this same Jesus thou has crucified God has made him Lord and Christ what's the problem we didn't come from somewhere else we're not a separate entity from Christ we came from him amen hallelujah was God tabernacled in flesh and it's something that Satan cannot do I hope you get this Satan cannot do what God did Satan cannot make a body and step into it and be a man do that church only God could because God is the only Creator and he made himself a body and he stepped into the body and the Bible says that God was in Christ reconciling the world to himself okay now we're getting somewhere Satan can't do that what does he do he has to take a man that's already and anoint him he's a robber put this mind let this mind be in you this is where it's at now let this mind be in you that was in Christ let the same mind be in you that he thought it not robbery no he thought it not robbery to be equal with God let that mind be in you because when you come to that understanding of deity tabernacled oh church this is something that Satan can't do this is why we shouted for joy not only because we were going to be tabernacled but because Christ would be there with us yet a little while and the world will see me no more not that man of 2,000 years ago you shall see for I will be with you even in you tabernacled until the end of the ages oh Satan can't do that Satan likes to get into animals yeah what about that serpent man yeah that's how we got in that's how he injected himself into the human race yes or yes Sayan can't do that or or Sayan can't do what God does that's why he's the robber anyone that does not come in through the door is a robber a thief and a robber why that's what he does Satan will go in the church try to find somebody he can anoint he's trying to find somewhere he can get in he's a robber God is not a robber God Tabernacles Satan doesn't Tabernacle Satan takes possession by force God is a gentleman when you open your heart to you Tabernacles yeah yeah anybody here all right I'm make sure I'm talking to somebody here no notice this now oh I got a little bit of time still I tell you these things to be alert young people be alert somebody tells you something that's not scriptural what do you tell them but remember you're not talking to the person our fight's not against flesh and blood R notice this now today there's a belief that's called Christ conscience anybody ever heard of that Christ conscience and the question is asked those that believe this do I have to be a Christian to achieve Christ consciousness watch how San trying to get in watch how subtle he is you can achieve Christ Consciousness a Christian who needs to go to church anymore me well it doesn't matter where you go to church oh it don't no why did he have Moses put a Tabernacle in the wilderness it matters who teaches you it matters where you go to church yes or yes all right Christ Consciousness is the highest state of intellectual development and emotional maturity it's sometimes termed as as the christed state because they say it represents the sacredness and purity of the individual they say that Jesus achieved this in his human life and was given this term as part of his [Music] name in recognition of the achievement the first error is that they don't believe that Jesus is divine red flag someone tells you that Jesus is not Divine you tell that Spirit that's right you don't have to listen to everything people tell you well let me just hear a little bit that next thing you know it you don't even know what you believe stand firm everything that teaches in the Bible that's what the prophet of God came to do to prove that the Bible is true the Bible is God in print form what he brought not be true it's all proven here you got to be strong don't ever believe that Spirit Jesus was both human and divine was the god man they go on to say that this path is open to anyone regardless of their religious Traditions when they are open to become a living vessel of love and truth and goodness New Age stuff you can never attain that without Jesus Christ am I boring you now no be alert hear these things know what you're talking about they say this is not exclusively for Christians all the world's religious Traditions offer a path to achieving this christed status all Paths of Love lead to the same Divine Source all the world's religious Traditions offer a path Jesus said I am the way the truth and the life no man comes to the father but by me there is no other way period everything else cut up and you by your Traditions make the word of God of no effect so the people to the people it sounds so good and inviting but as you look closer you see the spirit of antichrist there's no such a thing as being christed without the Christ and he is the Christ what think ye of Christ can I have like 10 minutes thank you all you get in any false cult that you wish to and you see many great symbols of true Christianity but the man-made religions will all come into this Antichrist religion there'll be two forms of them one form will come from Rome which will be the Beast and there is an image unto the Beast which will be the ecclesiastical head of the Protestant Church it'll all come under one great Dominion and the Antichrist will be the one that's enthroned and seated so if Antichrist is to be against Christ teaching this is the reason he's so much against Christ because teaching is what positions us and the goal of the Antichrist is to keep us from finding our position I'm going to I'm going to skip some of these things and get to this other part that's why he's so against he keeps us so occupied how many of you find yourself occupied in a lot of stuff that don't even matter in life NOP I people like that raise your hand no no okay how many of you find yourself doing so many things doesn't even matter hour after hour after hour the crazy thing about it right when you get a thought that says read your Bible yeah yeah yeah one more one more one more Tik Tok next thing know it 50 Tik toks have gone by and then we don't have why is he so against Christ it was the war in heaven but what watch then when we understand the shout then we understand First Corinthians 123 wherefore I give you to understand how many want to understand I want to understand that no man speaking by the spirit of God Called Jesus a cursed and that no man can say that Jesus is the Lord but by the Holy Ghost this is good stuff just give me like 10 15 minutes and I'm let me just put this on your lap no man and call Jesus the Lord except by the Holy Ghost you see the fight it takes the Holy Ghost tabernacled in flesh to be able to call Jesus Lord is Jesus lord how many is he Lord Brother Bram says he's your savior but is he really your Lord oh we're saved No Doubt but Lord means total ownership that's the only way he can have preeminence in US is if he becomes Lord notice this now he must Tabernacle in US brother Mark sent me this and I I really enjoyed this and it's it was a video of a man was a pastor missionary for many many years and he died and this is his account I want you to listen closely to this this is his account I Heard a Voice when I passed on that said your works are in vain that's right this is this is rough to hear this is why we got to check our every motive and objective of everything your Works were in vain he was telling that the voice everything he had done uh did this and I did this and I had orphanages and I fed the needy and I was Pastor for many years and the voice said your works are in vain the life that you lived and offered to me is an Abomination that I rejected in the Pharisees what made you think that I would accept it from a leodan type Christian in fact Untold Millions he said that boy says are living the same kind of life that you live and they stand in danger of my Everlasting wrath the man says I couldn't believe that he was talking to me I'm a prer I'm a teacher I just told him all my good works that I had done and the voice says you never did those works for me you did them for a false god list listen to where he what he gets to now he said but Lord remember no man can call Jesus Lord except by the Holy Ghost he said but Lord I called you Lord every day he said yes but you never made me Lord listen closely he said there's a difference to call him Lord only gives him a title but to make him Lord promotes him to the ruler of your life what was this false god that I had been serving he says and the voice says s e l FF in in engl self self that's the god that many serve self why we do it because we want to look good look what the brother's doing you want Glory from the people or you want it from God well well well I go to Africa and that's right I'm not saved because I go anywhere I Don't Preach because I want to be saved he already saved me but out of my I I love him so much and my respect and honor to him all I can do is surrender my life and say Lord use me if I can be used by you Lord let deity be tabernacled in me so that I can go spread the gospel not how much does brother Caleb do I can go to Africa and I can go to hell for that we feed millions and millions of people and still go to hell not based on that those works are an Abomination to God unless it is me that's been taken out of the way and it is Christ that liveth in me now now deity is Tabernacle now when I speak it's got to be him now notice what he says here what was this false god I was serving s self gratification self conceed self Justified well look what I did there's going to be a lot of a lot of surprises at the judgment I want you to get there's going to be a lot of surprises at the Judgment I remember my father saying one time the majority of preachers will be going to hell because we did it for self instead of for him not everyone that saith Lord Lord shall enter in many will say Lord Lord have we not prophesied in thy name cast out devils in thy name done many wonderful works and I'll profess I but I called you Lord you gave me a title never made me ruler of your life why do call me Lord the Bible says Lord Lord and do not the things that I say and afterwards the virgins will say Lord Lord open to us and he'll answer and say verily I stand to you know you not this is not about ourselves we have been tabernacled for a purpose not to be chismosos with one another hello it's not just to have a good time here in this in the earth even though we walk have a good time we're here for deity to be tabernacled just want to say this and I'll be closing just want to say this as as as we as I get to the end so much good stuff you're either for God or against God brother ROM says and the outward Expressions shows exactly what's on the inside and many of you think I got the baptism of the Holy Ghost I'm going to heaven that don't mean one thing that you're going to heaven I was at church in the Holy Ghost really fell and we go home and live the same kind of Life yes or yes seec I'm going to have to pick you back up because you guys are we're like we need help now what chance do we have we got you just hold on I got the baptism of Holy Ghost no that don't mean you're going to heaven you can have the baptism of the Holy Ghost every hour in your life still be lost and go to hell that's a hard one why because it was just a baptism but it's got to be a baptism after baptism after baptism after baptism after baptism until the temple is ready for deity to come now and enthrone itself that's why we're after church we're after the infilling of the Holy Ghost I don't want just the baptism want the infilling of the Holy Ghost I want him I want to be his Abode I want to be his his address that's what I want I want him to know that I am his and he is mine all the baptism did to you was excite your outer man got your spirit all excited but it never went to the soul that's where the gene of God is in the soul and the Holy Ghost has got to come down into the soul so that it can Quicken it inside out now Glory here's what we we just come to this and then I'll stop John 14:20 and at that day you'll know I am in my father in me and I in you I in you Tabernacle he that hath my Commandments and keepeth them he he is that loveth me and he that loveth me shall be loved of my father and I will love him and will manifest myself to him Judas saith unto him not scariot Lord how is it that thou Willl manifest thyself unto us and not unto the world Jesus answered and said unto him if a man love me he will keep my words and my father will love him and we will come unto him and make our Abode with him we will Tabernacle in him Church deity is no longer in heaven but say it again deity is no longer in heaven brother says deity is in you so if I were to ask this question brother will would you come to so if I were to ask you this question we need a baptism after baptism but answer me this question did Luther have the Holy Ghost that's a tricky one huh brother Jim says it's easy did Wesley have the Holy Ghost Wesley did the Pentecostals have the Holy Ghost and I'll tell you they had a baptism [Music] why because the prophet of God says this there were 200 million demons Chargers that were Bound in the river Euphrates I'm coming to an end now 200 million Chargers Bound in the river Euphrates imagine he says for 2,000 years imagine those chargers for 2,000 years let us go let us go I want turn us loose not yet stay there those angels that were there stay there they were not to be loose till the end time you know where I'm going with this 200 million chargers at the mouth ready to takeen and then brother says they came against the Jews in a literal standpoint they were turned Loose by Stalin and Hitler Hitler and those were ready to tear them apart almost annihilated all these Jews but they could not I'm going to say it again they could not do it they were let loose after being bound for 2,000 years brother brandham says the Holy Ghost was also Bound for 2000 years he said not at the Euphrates but at the rivers of denominations so then if the Holy Ghost was bound for 2,000 years imagine the power imagine the power of the Holy Ghost when he was ready to release this what were they waiting for for a man to let deity come and dwell in him and if any man would open the door I will come into him and I'll stop with him he with me brother brandham says was not until the last or the end time message that finally loed the Holy Ghost it was in this time that a prophet rose on the scene it was a a son of man revealing the son of man doing what it was deity Tabernacles what to release the Holy Ghost it was no longer a baptism it was the person of the Holy Ghost coming on the scene loose for you and I that's why he says and it came those 200 million [Music] chargers they come in a spiritual standpoint against the bride but then he says later on Feast of the trumpets you know where I'm going later on he says he says but she'll be gone by the time they could ever do anything to her because the person of the Holy Ghost prepared a bride that through Christ the Holy Ghost we are the only people history of life to be able to call Jesus I don't know if that does anything for you we the only ones that could ever really call him Lord because the Holy Ghost was now let loose no man calls Jesus Lord except by the Holy Ghost and it's loose now he's loose with all his power he has raised the church he's uniting a church together because he's coming for her Hello everybody stand to your feet if you would he's coming for he's here he's here for you what are you wait for don't try to be like everybody else in church serve him by a personal experience you don't have to be like anybody else be you it's who we are in Christ he's not coming for a lot of people he's not coming for a lot of Christ coming for his body just one if we are members of that body we can go and he's given us this opportunity to make things right say Lord I I failed in a lot of ways I messed up Lord but I'm willing to tell the enemy to shut up today and to say there still is is grace and mercy for you so if you want that and you can just raise your hand as you bow your head make it right between you and God now forgive me [Music] Lord through my hardest times Lord that I would not serve you and worship you like you deserve Lord forgive me Lord for complaining Lord I have no right to complain Lord forgive us our failures this morning Lord you see every hand that's lifted I raised my hand with them Lord for all have sinned and come short of the glory of God but Lord we are we have heard the summons come up higher and Lord I tell the church then today again repeating your words come up higher there's anyone here that just just need to just let yourself go and say Lord do something with me today I don't want to go home and be the same the same that I've been Lord Church his coming is so [Music] close I don't want to lose not one of you he promised not one of you will be lost I cry to you and I say Church get in line whether you're a minister whether you're a deacon whether you're a lay person can can you be real with him today can you open your heart
