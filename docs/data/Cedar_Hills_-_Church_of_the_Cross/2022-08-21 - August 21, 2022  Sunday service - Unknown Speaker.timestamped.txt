[48:24] that precious blood of the lord
[48:34] and we have a little subject that's
[48:36] going to be fairly simple this morning

[49:27] very familiar scripture
[49:31] and we're going to hit it maybe from a
[49:33] little different angle this morning
[49:38] the title of our message is realizing
[49:41] your potential
[49:57] behold i will send you elijah the
[50:00] prophet before the coming of the great
[50:03] and dreadful day of the lord
[50:10] granted
[50:13] and he shall turn the heart
[50:15] singular of the fathers
[50:18] to the children
[50:25] and the heart singular of the children
[50:28] to their fathers lest they come and
[50:30] smite the earth with a curse
[51:00] john 5 excuse me they say 2 it's john 5
[51:03] juan

[51:10] how many love the lord this morning
[51:13] el senor and esta manana how many came
[51:15] to learn this morning
[51:19] i know i have yo
[51:45] father judgeth no man but he had
[51:47] committed all judgment unto the son
[51:56] that all men should honor the son even
[51:59] as they honor the father
[52:01] he that honoreth this not the son on
[52:04] earth not the father which have sinned
[52:14] verily verily i say unto you he that
[52:17] heareth
[52:18] my word
[52:19] and believeth on him that sent me
[52:23] hath everlasting life
[52:25] and shall not come into the condemnation
[52:28] but has passed from death
[52:44] lord jesus we just thank you this
[52:45] morning for your word lord jesus
[52:50] it's such a privilege to come and honor
[52:52] your resurrection
[52:54] resurrection as your prophet said
[53:10] but lord it's
[53:12] not the day so much but it's that you
[53:14] rose from the dead lord
[53:21] and you presented yourself alive to us
[53:26] and we're just such a privileged people
[53:28] senor somos
[53:31] we commit ourselves into your hands here
[53:32] in the pulpit and in the audience
[53:38] in the name of the lord jesus christ
[53:42] amen amen you may be seated
[53:49] amen
[53:52] i'd like to give the definition of the
[53:54] word
[54:01] how many of you
[54:03] would like to reach your potential
[54:08] potential
[54:09] how many know what your potential is
[54:14] potential
[54:15] how many know what god thinks your
[54:18] potential
[54:23] and is takes me to this word that the
[54:25] lord took me to this word potential
[54:28] potential
[54:30] and it simply says existing and
[54:33] possibility is implemented
[54:36] existing impossibility
[54:39] this potential exists it's right there
[54:42] in the possibility estee potential
[54:44] existed
[54:47] but if it stays in that stage
[54:58] you never realize that potential what it
[55:01] is
[55:04] something very simple
[55:06] and it says capable of development into
[55:10] actuality
[55:15] and
[55:17] something real algorithm it's it's it's
[55:20] a potential you you have the capability
[55:26] to be developed into something so
[55:30] precious before the lord de certain
[55:35] and this takes me to another word yes
[55:39] we're not going to hit this this morning
[55:41] no hablaremos esto en esta manana but
[55:44] the word unveiling
[55:48] when you
[55:49] come to what your potential is
[55:53] potential and it comes forth or you
[55:56] realize it
[56:16] unveil to remove a veil or covering from
[56:24] to make public
[56:27] to divulge
[56:37] to make
[56:38] known something such as a confidence i
[56:42] said
[56:57] you must find out what god has
[57:00] confidence in tiene que la secuenta en
[57:03] que dios tiene confienza how many want
[57:06] god to have confidence in you
[57:10] amen
[57:25] amen amen and you might ask well why did
[57:27] you start with malachi 4 5 and 6.
[57:35] and if you all could put up that first
[57:37] quote for me out of christ the mystery
[57:40] of god revealed
[57:47] amen if they can get it if not i'll get
[57:50] it here in the present when that is you

[58:42] to turn the heart of the jewish fathers
[58:45] to the children of the kingdom
[59:02] but can we see
[59:04] what it means to us as the bride but
[59:10] how many believe that elijah himself
[59:13] brother brenna juantos
[59:16] mismo el hermano
[59:22] or converted or converted back to the
[59:26] original faith of the apostolic fathers
[59:33] that he was the prophet and it was just
[59:35] push button and he was
[59:37] he was already in that stature
[59:44] no first the spirit of elijah and him
[59:47] had to restore him
[59:53] first he had to see where the apostolic
[59:56] faith was
[1:00:00] in his day in sudhir
[1:00:02] amen amen many say well yeah just the
[1:00:05] apostles of the bible
[1:00:11] but brother branham urbano
[1:00:26] ben instead either
[1:00:29] why if there ever was an apostle to the
[1:00:32] pentecostal people
[1:00:37] it was at that password where buzzword
[1:00:41] well there was controversy and they
[1:00:42] wanted to to argue with brother brenham
[1:00:44] about doctrine
[1:00:50] brother venom didn't like that
[1:00:54] he would shy away from that
[1:00:57] and that's where it would say
[1:01:00] let me add them
[1:01:03] to me
[1:01:04] let me have it yeah that halos on me and
[1:01:07] then and then
[1:01:08] brother said promise me you're not going
[1:01:12] to argue with them
[1:01:17] thank you brother gracias
[1:01:19] why because that was his ministry
[1:01:37] that now these apostolic fathers
[1:01:41] apostolics would have
[1:01:43] to pour out the faith they had dendrian
[1:01:49] upon the children
[1:01:53] and we're going to be talking a lot
[1:01:54] about what a father is and what a child
[1:01:57] is yeah
[1:02:00] what immaturity is and what maturity is
[1:02:07] i wanted to give you that just a little
[1:02:10] preview of that
[1:02:13] before we read this quote
[1:02:16] out of christ the mystery of god
[1:02:18] revealed
[1:02:32] but then god said in the last days he
[1:02:34] would bring out a people washed in his
[1:02:36] blood
[1:02:43] and they were predestinated to be there
[1:02:45] yesterday
[1:03:14] let's turn around and tell your neighbor
[1:03:18] i've got to be here
[1:03:28] okay amen i'm in let's keep going
[1:03:35] i will malachi 4
[1:03:38] what would he do restore back again
[1:03:40] bring back in the last days these great
[1:03:42] things
[1:03:56] yes what'd he do
[1:04:01] was to bring back the faith of the
[1:04:04] fathers
[1:04:08] to the children
[1:04:10] amen so malachi of four five and six is
[1:04:14] compound
[1:04:17] it's not just talking about the
[1:04:18] dispensations
[1:04:22] it's talking about a condition
[1:04:39] yeah i want to pour it out on the
[1:04:40] children
[1:04:43] bring it to the children
[1:04:46] see that's right
[1:04:48] to bring back the same thing right
[1:04:51] the same pillar of fire that column
[1:04:54] on the scene in listen the same signs
[1:04:58] sing wonders
[1:05:00] name jesus
[1:05:02] making him the same hacienda hacienda
[1:05:04] preaching him the same foreign
[1:05:14] [Applause]
[1:05:21] in this ministry that god has given us
[1:05:24] the privilege
[1:05:25] to participate
[1:05:32] and now our pastor now yeah
[1:05:47] now i want you to notice something here
[1:05:52] when i give the definition of the word
[1:05:54] divulge
[1:05:58] it said
[1:05:59] to make known something such as a
[1:06:01] confidence or a secret seral
[1:06:07] what's the most important secret to you
[1:06:14] what
[1:06:15] is
[1:06:30] who am i
[1:06:36] when you find out what god has
[1:06:38] confidence in us
[1:06:43] then the secret of your potential will
[1:06:46] come forth
[1:06:48] potential
[1:06:50] how many believe that god has confidence
[1:06:52] in this
[1:06:56] well he's not even handsome anymore he's
[1:06:57] getting uglier every day
[1:07:01] when i look in the mirror
[1:07:04] he don't have confidence in this
[1:07:07] but there's something he has confidence
[1:07:10] in bro
[1:07:13] now i want to go back and continue
[1:07:15] reading that quote this will be we'll
[1:07:17] try not to read too much
[1:07:19] already
[1:07:23] 20 25 minutes go by
[1:07:34] i will restore said the lord all the
[1:07:37] years that the methodist worm
[1:07:39] the caterpillar worm and the baptist and
[1:07:42] the catholic
[1:07:44] yo restaurant
[1:07:52] watch this we can all say oh yeah that
[1:07:55] that's uh joel 1 and 2.
[1:08:00] but watch this
[1:08:02] watch this statement
[1:08:04] and the catholic
[1:08:06] los catolicos cama coma and all
[1:08:11] them worms eat that faith down
[1:08:21] where did those worms come from
[1:08:37] he's talking about the spirit of
[1:08:40] denominationalism
[1:08:45] and what is the problem today amongst
[1:08:47] our ranks
[1:08:51] i shared this with brother hector many
[1:08:52] many years ago
[1:08:55] people hear the message
[1:08:59] they come out of denominations
[1:09:03] or they come out of
[1:09:08] but egypt or denomination never comes
[1:09:12] out of them
[1:09:17] so
[1:09:18] i don't believe people do it on purpose
[1:09:19] most of the time
[1:09:23] i don't believe that when i did it at
[1:09:25] first i did it on purpose i did it
[1:09:32] but i was just a little baptist boy
[1:09:37] that's all i knew
[1:09:39] that was my make-up
[1:09:42] so when i heard the message of the hour
[1:09:46] something so distinct
[1:09:48] and that little voice down in the soul
[1:09:50] saying
[1:09:53] this is the truth
[1:09:56] amen amen so
[1:09:59] watch this
[1:10:01] in the foreknowledge of god and el preco
[1:10:03] no simento de dios
[1:10:05] do you believe
[1:10:07] creole's death
[1:10:08] that god knew
[1:10:10] sabia in general in general
[1:10:14] what man was going to do with this
[1:10:17] message
[1:10:20] from the year of 1965 delano
[1:10:25] to the year of
[1:10:26] 2022 helano dos milbentidos
[1:10:42] that
[1:10:52] another denomination
[1:10:55] it cannot produce
[1:11:25] the estimate received the revelation of
[1:11:28] jesus christ
[1:11:31] and they grew up from being children
[1:11:34] decreasing
[1:11:36] they became fathers
[1:11:49] could be given to the next generation
[1:12:04] is
[1:12:21] we're not going to go into what i've
[1:12:22] said about it before yes
[1:12:26] but it simply means
[1:12:30] significant
[1:12:31] to transmit it
[1:12:33] uh transmitted it can't just be in
[1:12:36] written form
[1:12:40] no dramatized means that it's active and
[1:12:43] it's alive
[1:12:47] in the process of when it's being
[1:13:29] to turn the heart of the fathers to the
[1:13:31] children
[1:13:35] wasn't just speaking of the jewish
[1:13:37] followers
[1:13:40] it was speaking about the apostolic
[1:13:43] fathers
[1:13:44] de
[1:13:50] you know i i never heard brother tommy
[1:13:52] ever say that he was an apostle
[1:13:57] he said you're getting personal now yes
[1:13:59] this is personal hermanos my personality
[1:14:01] is personal

[1:14:26] i'm
[1:14:42] i am an apostle of jesus christ
[1:14:47] what did he say at that stage of his
[1:14:49] ministry
[1:14:51] because god had already proved his
[1:14:54] election
[1:14:58] he was only confessing what god had
[1:15:01] already vindicated
[1:15:06] that when can you and i as children of
[1:15:08] god when though
[1:15:37] message what this potential is
[1:15:41] is the potential

[1:18:12] child

[1:19:43] there his disciples were looking at him
[1:19:47] and he put a child there
