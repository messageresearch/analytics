afternoon with our hearts full of joy at these two people have found each other but we pray father that they have found you first for you are the author and the finisher of our faith and everything that we do in word and indeed and we always do it in the name of jesus and father as we draw an eye to you we ask father that you will come to this ceremony and maybe you seal it with what you have come to give us today and that is your love and father when this is all over we'll be sure to give you all the honor and all the glory in the name of the lord jesus christ we pray amen you may be seated for a few moments i i want to express to you a few things this afternoon as we have for the last few weeks we've been to two weddings three funerals so this is a completely different occasion and i asked joe as i saw him two two weeks ago him and rebecca got married and i asked him uh if he still liked her and uh he says no i love her and that's really really good i appreciate appreciate that and we're appreciative to to this fine couple that has come here this uh afternoon i've never seen a wedding party more colorful than you all today but that that that that is always good to bring color into the situation the bible speaks to us for a few moments charity suffereth long and is kind charity envieth not charity wanteth not itself is not puffed up does not behave itself unseemly seeketh not her own is not easily provoked thinketh no evil rejoices not in iniquity but rejoices in the truth charity the bible says never faileth but whether there be prophecies they shall fail whether there shall be tongues they shall cease whether there be knowledge it shall vanish away and again charity never fails charity is the term that is used in scripture but as we understand that charity is love in the book of matthew the 19th chapter and the eighth verse and the last part of that verse it says but from the beginning it was not so the prophet of god tells us marriage is the oldest institution in the world marriage was first performed and instituted in the garden of eden in understanding what has been given to us around the world there are many things that have have have eluded us and have come into into into direct conflict with what we believe as as a people it was not an accident that god started creation with a marriage and in in ourselves around the world when we see the the the battle fronts and and we see the assault completely on the marriage and in the institution that we know that it is between a man and a woman that is what god instituted in the beginning adam and eve it was not again it was it was it is not an accident that god started creation with the marriage when you look into the scripture the bible speaks to us but from the beginning of the creation god made them male and female and then he says for this cause shall a man leave his father and mother and cleave to his wife and they twain shall be one flesh so then they are no more twain but one flesh what therefore god hath joined together let not man put asunder when each time i think as we hear the man say the level of violence and evil that has been unleashed these days all i can think about is the teachings of the ancient prophet jeremiah as he sought to speak to the children of judah in vain to depart from their evil ways and their waywardness that earned him the name the weeping prophet one of the institutions that has received the greatest bastion of all is the institution of marriage i say this afternoon that the church should not be silent upon that that issue when you come into the the basis of the knowledge of the truth anything happens today and anything is normal living together becomes normal doing different things of the world has become normal but in the beginning it was not so and when we understand the ruling of god in our lives we come here today because i don't come here today just to see such beautiful people even though we we see a great audience of very nice people we come today for god himself to come and put his seal of approval on this marriage that's the only way that this this marriage will ever last even amongst evangelicals today 50 of the people getting a a divorce out in the world in the secular world more than 60 of the people end up in divorce and you wind up and you find out why well there are extenuating circumstances of why people aren't together and there are generalized and etc and we can go by case by case but the simplicity of the of the gospel is i was cutting hair one day and i i i i asked a man told me and i we were as we were conversating about about marriage he said one day his mama or or his wife i should say went to his father's home and said uh dad we're having trouble and this is what i want to get to maybe to the adults and the parents and the grandparents of these two fine people this this afternoon is everybody's got an opinion on how you should rate you should you should be in your house everybody's got an opinion of what they should do but there's only one that should should rule in our home and that that is god and i i look and i i see and and and he the the lady comes to the papa's house and says dad i'm leaving this man she said well first i got to ask you two questions does he beat you he says no does he go out on you no he says well then get out of my home and go fix your own problems this is what is inside of ourselves should be everybody's got an opinion papa's got an opinion grandpapa's got an opinion everybody's got an opinion i wouldn't do that of course you wouldn't do that you're not you're not them everybody's an individual but when we comment this afternoon that you're taking these these great vows that you have that we are going to give you it is something of vast importance that that not that only death can separate and can can can do that it shouldn't be that anyone to come in we know we have our marriage counselors we know we have our pastor that gives us the guide but after that when you go to your mama's home when you go to your papa's home when you go to the grandparents home grandparents papas refrain and say hey we're here for the betterment we want these people to make it in in itself in understanding of what marriage marriage it has has has done i me and my wife been married 37 years this coming july will be 37 years and i i love her more than i do then i than i did the day i married her well the day i married her i knew very little about her and as the days go by and as you go into your your you your your struggles together and if you go through your hardships together don't let those hardships and those struggles tear you apart that it unite you together as is the struggles that you are going through together in itself marriage is gonna be work not gonna be all fun and games not gonna be all hunky-dory up in the sky it's not gonna be disneyland every day sometimes it'll be six flags right you know what i mean right all right i know you're mature people remember when god is on your side you can do this never give up on each other somebody will tell you give up on him somebody will tell you give up her don't ever give up love never amen make sure you maintain that whatever brought you to today what brought you today is love don't ever lose that and your love as you found the lord then you found each other wow what a time and this is what we want to bring into this marriage the first person that needs to be present at every dinner table at every morning every evening when you come home from work wherever you go to let it be christ centered in your life and once he's there anything's possible god [Music] from this point life has begun from this moment you are the one right beside you

in your the answer to my prayers all we need is just [Music] my dreams [Music] is [Music] i promise you this [Music] ecclesiastes the fourth chapter and the twelfth verse tells us and if one prevail against him two shall withstand him and a threefold cord is not quickly broken you'll never braid her hair but that's all right i can you can have comprehensive good of job don't don't don't sit yeah

these persons two persons present come now to be joined if there is anyone here that can show a just cause why they should not be lawfully joined in this holy matrimony let them now speak or forever hold their peace i will require and charge you both as you will surely answer at the day of judgment when the secrets of all hearts shall be disclosed that if either of you know any impediment why you should not be lawful join together in this holy matrimony do you now confess it for be it assured unto you that any persons that are joined otherwise then god's word does allow their marriage is not lawful but believing that you have fully duly considered the solemn obligation that you are about to assume that you have prepared to enter upon the same reverently disgracefully wisely and in the fear of god i shall propose to you the marriage covenant you will declare the same as you join your right hands good right good that zachary will you take this woman to be your lawful wedded wife to live together in this holy state of matrimony do you promise to love honor and cherish in sickness and health riches or poverty and will forsake all others and cleave thee only unto her as long as you

promise to speak well of him in his presence and out of his presence and will forsake all others and cleave thee only unto him as long as you both live i do i like this one they're sure i will require
