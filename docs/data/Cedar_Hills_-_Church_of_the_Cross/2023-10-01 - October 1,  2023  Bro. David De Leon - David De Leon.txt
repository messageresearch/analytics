divers Miracles and Gifts of a holy ghost according to his own will not what man say what the church said but what God's will was oh we need to seek the will of God not to favor of your neighbor not the favor of your children that's a favor of your husband or your wife but seek the will of God do that first let everything else the will of the wife and the will of the children will fall right in with it but Place God first oh God he became Lord and his creation that he might redeem man homeless helpless man and give them a home in heaven he left the glories of Heaven he left the highest name that could be called and when he was on Earth meant give him the lowest name that they could give him said he was an illegitimate baby to start with born in a manger wrapping Rags off the back of the Yoke of an ox no place to go had no home to go to and was called the algebra the chief of the devils he was mistreated he was spit on he was made fun of he was rejected prostitutes that's what man done to him but God raised him up so high that he didn't have to look down to see heaven man get in the loyal seat given the worst place the lowest thing God raised him up getting the highest seat and the highest name that's the difference what man done with the Son of God and what God done with the son of God he stooped that we might be lifted he become us that we do his grace might become him he come to the homeless and became homeless himself that we might have a home he came to the sick and was made sick himself that we might be healed he came to the center and made sin himself that we might be saved no wonder he was exalted no wonder he is who he is tonight God has exalted him and all the powers and heavens and earth is give to him oh how we can only stop just in him who are you

he become you that you through his grace might become him make a place for him oh we who think that we gotta change our clothes and a few groceries in the house what are we God could take it in a second you're very breath holes in his hand and even our midst and to foretell and every time perfect and even concerned us to bring a little dead fish back to its life again in the midst of us the Bible said he has set it on high and give gifts on the man that was the atmosphere hung over the Earth of Darkness of Gloom of death and weary the prayers can come up because the atonement was made but he broke through that Veil he opened up the way he broke the veil of sickness he broke the veil of sin he broke the veil of weary he broke the veil of depressed he broke every veil in me the highway foreign [Music] [Music] put all things in subjection under his feet he left nothing that is not under him but now we see not all things but under him that's dead we don't see death yet because we're still dying we see their butt nice person but we see Jesus amen for it becometh him for whom all all things that by whom we have all things and then again many sons if he made the chief captain of our Salvation through suffering the only way he can become the captain of our Salvation he had to suffer listen to these beautiful words you know Allison horrible he that Sanctified and they that are Sanctified are all one oh don't you see the bar and the branch there all one for which cause he is not ashamed to be called brethren see why listen to the next verse saying I will declare thy mean unto my brethren in the midst of the church will I Sing Praises unto thee and again I will put my trust in him and again behold I and the children which thou has given me or so much then as the children are partakers our flesh and blood he also himself likewise took part all the same that through the death he might destroy him which has the power of death that is the devil and deliver them who through for the through for death were always kept subject into bondage men always feared death Christ became sin made low to take death upon himself and he's not ashamed to be called our brother for he was gifted just like we are tempted so don't you see brother sister the whole thing is Grace all of it is Grace it's not what you do anyhow it's what he's already done for you now you can't do one thing to marriage your salvation your salvation is a gift Christ became sin that you might become righteous and he's the right kind of a chief Captain for our Salvation because he suffered just like we suffered he's been tempted just like we're tempted and he's not ashamed to be called our brother [Music] because he knows what we go through with God may we never neglect this great salvation

from all the brothers her husband please versus 1-13 First Corinthians chapter 12. and then we're gonna read Philippians 1 verses 20 to 27. foreign whoever I give you to understand that no man speaking by the spirit of God calls Jesus a curse can say Jesus is the Lord but by the holy ghosts now there are diversity of gifts but the Same Spirit yes and there are differences of differences of administration but the same Lord yes and there are diversities of operations but it is the same God which work works all in all manifestation but the the manifestation of the spirit is given to every man to your Prophet without for the one is given by this the spirit the word of wisdom and to another word of knowledge by The Same Spirit into another Faith by The Same Spirit to another gift of healing by the same Spirits so another working of Miracles to another prophecy to another Discerning of spirits to another diverse kinds of tongues to another the interpretation of tongues that all these works the one and the self-same spirit divide into every man severally as he will soon Christo or as one but for the body is one and has many members and all the members of that one body being many are one body though also is Christo for by one Spirit we are all baptized into one bodygues whether we be Jews or Gentiles whether we be boundary and have been all made to drink into one spirit for the body is not one member but many filipences Uno now let's go to Philippians chapter 1. conformation according to my Earnest expectation in my hope that there are nothing else shall be ashamed but that with all boldness and as always so also now Christ shall be magnified in my body whether it be by life or by Death for to be to live is Christ and to die his game results I live in the flesh this is the fruit of my labor he what mejor o quedarena flesh is more needful for me I need to read verse 23 for I am straight between two having the desire to depart and to be with Christ Which is far better nevertheless to abide in the flesh is more needful for me and happiness confidence I know that I shall abide and continue with you all for your furtherance and joy of faith that your rejoicing may be more abundant in Jesus Christ for me by by coming to you again and to let your conversation be as it becomes the gospel of Christ that whether I come and see you or else be absent I may hear of your Affairs that ye stand fast in one spirit with one mind striving together for the faith of the Gospel God bless his words the subject is the body of Christ um your subtitle is teamwork I'm just going to give you what I received from God cuando Caleb I remember when I called brother Kayla is to make an agreement on the date when I would come when I hung up the phone um hung up the phone I thought the leading the recipe to Santo of the Holy Spirit and he told me to go to the book of Philippians he is a yellow yellow I've been reading it in weeks before and and I I looked at the topic again I'm going to share a few scriptures with you in a little while but that just jumped out at me and that's where I got the stock from reinforce the teamwork the privilege to to congratulate your pastorio together with the ministry and all the church here in Las Cruces for the great work that they have done I know it's not man doing the work is is it's God doing the work we are just servants he foreign I was reading in the message Oneness he is and the prophet of the Lord says amen of course they say it again make it up God calls us by the Holy Spirit we are baptized to be part of that body to be able to occupy a place for a certain function inside of the body the mystical body of the Lord Jesus [Music] as the body is and has many members and all the members being many Sonos so also isados for by one spread we were all baptized into one body with Jews or Gentiles and it has been made all to drink into one spirit for the body is not one member many because I am not the I am not of the body is it therefore not of the body is the hearing if the whole body were hearing the smelly Masa colocados but now God has said the members of every one of them in the body as it has pleased him foreign but now are they many members yeah but one body necesito and the I cannot say to the hand I have no need of you New York again the head to the feet much more of those members of the body which seem to be more evil are necessary yeah and those members of the body which we think to be less honorable upon this we bestow more abundant honor in our in our uncommonly parts have more abundant Communists for our commonly Parts you have no need but God has tempered the body together having given more abundant honor to the part which Lacks there should be no Schism in the body but that the members should have the same care one for the other um a family where part of the body of Christ but sometimes we don't seem to care about our brothers our sister the way we should treat them and behave uh participation is the same way in the spiritual for the body to work together it has to work it is commonly in the same way the Body Works in the naturalness it's teamwork there can be advancements and you can see the results it's also the quality to maintain themselves United and to be able to create an atmosphere of positive work and how the members of that body recognize the the efforts of each member of the body a combined effort to give and take armonia Harmony and partnership I want to look in English that said partnership compellation is fellowship they said partnership you know in English it says partnership that is different it is the partner is the the companero partner is a companion or an associate somebody that's in aligned one with the other is there will be no second one there to pick him up how beautiful it is to be able to work and as one as a team the Lord has called us to be a part of the mystical body of the Lord Jesus and through the New Birth by the Holy Spirit first he deals with us individually then collectively El is to be a part of this mystical body of the Lord Jesus and each one of us have a function is not the function that you have chosen it's like the body your body God put your hand here if you would have wanted it to be the head with us it would not be here many times we do not understand what God has called us and it's because of the lack of that new birth you can have a gift because gifts are without repentance there are men that have tremendous gifts of God but if that new birth or without that new birth they do more damage than good but how wonderful it is that God has given them a gift to be a blessing not only for the local church but wherever God would send you that is something very tremendous and something that I admire very much of the Servants of God of the ministers maintain yourself humble and simple really that is the Holy Spirit can we give an Applause to the Servants of God and amongst us there's quite a few of them they have been an example to me in my walk if it wasn't for those men what would happen with this message what happened to us we would not have touched we would not have footprits in the sands of time that we could follow them those examples those great Servants of God I had the great privilege to meet the founding and know the founding pastor of this church a while back or I would come here to the United States it was always a great privilege and a great honor to see him and to see the way that God would use him you see the Simplicity of that man of God that's why his sons are just like him foreign I would not be here I don't like to get together with just anybody I don't make an alliance with just anybody I like to see the heart of the man first I'd like to discern his Spirit but their motives and objectives they're the same ones that I have and that is to help the people of God to be able to take the good news maybe help one or two Souls I say those are the ones of my team because that's the Holy Spirit the men of godinero they don't look for money they don't look profane they only look to be the servants and to serve but because eternal life is to live for others you don't think about yourself anymore that's the Holy Spirit when you have the Holy Spirit you don't just all the time think about yourself but you are thinking and which way you can help if you're a member of the church and you speak to the pastors what can I help is to to serve him uh may God bless various Brothers here in Las Cruces some of them knew I was coming here and they called me they said Brother David we are so happy you're going to be with us I'm just reporting to see it in any way I could help you yes and that is wonderful yeah you know there's one that calls me quite often he called me very early he's standing back there in the corner there I know that yeah brother Daniel the Brother David just checking if everything's okay I know my pastor has everything covered if anything that you need just give me a call yes and that is very good that is and that is eternal life each member of our body is so important each one of the Sons and Daughters of God that have been called to take for a work how simple or small that work is important less than nobody never feel better than anybody you're number one and what God has called you no one can do the work foreign last night that gives follow the beliefs we don't have to be following anything miracles of a true Christian which of your fingers doesn't do any good for you okay it's okay that's the teacher that's the teacher that's very good they're all important they are all so important and that is the way it is with the sons of God all of us are important the Devil Comes sometimes and says you're no good for nothing you don't know how to do anything and that is not true if God noticed us and before the foundation of the world he predestinated us and then he called us that we could come now and be manifested be justified and Sanctified and then filled with the Holy Spirit and positionally placed by revelation Dios God will tell us then what our position is that's what pastors are foreign we are your trainers or your coaches it says also when God calls a man he equips that man you're not you're just for any mistake or Reason God knew is God knew that Kelly Paris would be the pastor here brother Caleb cannot do all the work by himself and I don't care how tremendous he is but God he sent him a team of men from different with different gifts officials different offices different abilities that were going to help the ministry of the pastor and together form a team to not only just help the local church likewise internationally to help that is something so tremendous men that have been obedient and subject to the pasture they don't they're not running around all Loose by themselves a pastor he deserves respect yeah Pastor you should take him in the couch is that the lord gave me um when I hang up with you I like you I like to read this uh it's the New Testament Modern English Phillips Pastor gave it to me many years ago um and I want to read it in English were you at Okay so Philippians chapter one verse 27. versus chapter 1 verse 27. says but whatever happens make sure that your everyday life is worthy of the gospel of Christ so that whether I do come and see you or merely hear about you from a distance I may know that you are standing fast in the united spirit battling with a single line for the faith of the gospel and not carrying two straws for your innings Helio amen you you may be seated standing first in a United Spirit but I was unanimous the subject of Oneness was a subject they didn't give enough importance to because he knows what unity means okay realize Associates with God and they don't realize that a bad spirit is anointing them and instead of being one with their brothers instead of being one with the deacons instead of being one with your pastor is contrary they are contrary spirits anointing anointing anointing anointing anointing first they come here it's an anointing then it becomes an obsession then it becomes a possession that's why we must be so careful the scripture is so simple it's so simple I'm going to read it again I may know that you are standing fast in a United Spirit battling with a single mind for the faith of the gospel and not carrying two straws for your enemy amen verse 27 again yes it's so difficult to do that Johnny is that so hard to do it's not hard on espanol okay verse 27 okay okay you know what the most successful teams are brother Tim brother Tim uh what sport did you play Chuck you were talking last night was it soccer or no no but but the one no America football you know what the most successful teams have they're not the ones that always have the best players in Europe there's a team that they have the best players you can have but they've never won you know why because among them I mean there's such a diversity of different things and there's Envy so that he doesn't get to go that he doesn't get the glory that's why that team will never win or never wins the best teams are those instruction there in Mexico and he says anybody can make up a team he says the typical that the members of that team that they can play together they can identify themselves and they can back up one another yes and to be in the same Spirit that's the most difficult thing whatever you want to call it it's tennis shoes or whatever he's wearing Diablo that's the work of the devil yesterday we should be a good Sportsman so much money there's goalkeepers that they earn Millions only just to block the ball so it doesn't go into the goal s there's a lot of money in the midst of all that is you know the devil likes football he likes to put in the gold himself he likes to put a goal against the pastoros but if there's good blockers they're not going to get not one bow should also be watching remember you talked to us about this I want to remind you of this this and this thank you thank you brother here's a certain situation here brother watch this watch our men are going to be watching all the time you walk working together with the pastoring with the ministry all together this is a tremendous Church you want to see a tremendous Mighty Church give me a church that's so humble and so full of love members that the sisters that when they're dismissing themselves from one another they hug each other they say sister I'll be praying for you sister please pray for me and that love produces we need more of the love of God foreign foreign companions companions sisters that are basm buddy yeah when they're eating at the fellowship Halls they go shopping together everything that you do it together and then all of a sudden foreign what happened what happened where did the love go to then it wasn't the love of God something got in there a disagreement misunderstanding no say I don't know but why did they permit that is whatever it might have been that it would disunite them any disagreement there might be we have the word we have a pastor yeah sometimes the pastor doesn't even know and all of a sin says what happened with this sister and this sister what happened no I I don't know I don't know either that's that's bad we're not helping the unity and God desires for us to fight together that we stand together for the truth Brothers I would like to be Philippians chapter 2. verses verse 4. doing uh verse 12 to 4. 2-4 of Philippians yes now if you have known anything for Christ encouragement and love means anything to you if you have known something of the fellowship of his spirit and all that it means in kindness and deep sympathy to make my best hope for you come true live together in harmony live together in love as though you had only one mind and one Spirit between you it's verse uh one and two okay this second yeah if you'll be there for any consolation in Christ in English um and then and then the verse two did you read verse yeah I just read Mystique live together in harmony live together in love as though you had one mind and one Spirit between you dance and sometimes we don't feel that way we don't feel like happy happy if I don't feel happy something's been wrong with me um or I'm jealous I preached on a few of them there's thousands and thousands of demons and we are invaded by demons the prophet said those demons he said they were going to come against us he was going to try to divide us to separate us through here to destroy the headquarters of God this is the headquarters that's what the prophet said take insides with Jesus that's where he says it this is a point to advance what I'm talking about he's the military man this is a headquarters that's why God sends soldiers that's why he puts captains Pastor is a captain and he puts me to instruct you to gain more souls there's just a little time left last one comes in we're gonna leave this place if we're not ready the rapture's still going to go anywhere do people are worried about their deaths they want this they want that they want to get so much money or whatever it's nothing but vanities you should be worried about they're not worried about it at all because the spirit gets in there you're conformed I go to church I'm a good person I pay my taxes I help the Widow yes okay and that what does that mean that's that's fine but the question is do you have the Holy Spirit have you been born again as your nature truly been changed are there still things that you are struggling with and you haven't been able to overcome them yet and speaking on the Seal of God The Boxcar the train the Train the Box The Boxcar the train in general General Motors in in Mexico I work for General Motors 33 years there in Saltillo I worked at the engine and transmission plant once in a while I would like to go into the plants and I would like to see how they would get ready everything to put the motor together prepare the ship prepare the shipments of the motors of the engines the motors he until you see that everything is in order he's speaking of the heart I will go there into the plant I will put in their place the motors and their in the robot in the real box the north part of the United States many different places and not everything was put in order the movement of the train is against things and it would damage the motors the supervisors see that everything's in its place everything very well located if you see that the locks were closed and everything was ready then he will put a seal I'm sealed it's the same in the spiritual brother that are not right but God can take that away from your brothers he can take any bad habit away from here whatever bad Spirit sometimes we inherit espiritus Spirits they are inherited one day she asked the prophet says I already got baptized I do the best that I can Christiana I try to be a good Christian that I have a spirit that I haven't been able to get rid of it and he asked her what foreign I am stubborn I hope there's no stubborn sisters here yes very loving obedient subject yes amen no no no you know what the prophet answered her Mana he said sister under discernment he says God showed me that spirit is not yours they say this is if you go back in your genealogy your family you had a great grandfather that he was so stubborn yes Espiritu and that spirit said came down to your grandparents then he came down to your father and then when you were born It Came Upon you but he says go to the altario surrender to God and don't pay any attention to that [Music] and it will never bother you again if you want to come ignore ignore it don't pay any attention to it oh this is you say why do I struggle so much with this you might ask I don't want that yes but if we can go back somebody had it there was another sister with thunder and lightning and with rain yeah and she would get so nervous in such a bad way yeah yeah for me can you pray for me I have a bad Spirit he says something ugly comes into me I don't understand it and brother Branham when he was praying for her before he prayed he waited and God shot him okay her father when he was young he was on riding his horse he was going up into the mountains and a great storm came down and he got scared experience he had was that great storm he says let us pray yes and that is going to leave you the those pigs died but the spirits they pass from one generation to another generation Los mismos Diablos the same Devils the same Spirits the same Pharisees that were in the time of Jesus they're here today also it's the same Spirits criticize the word yes they only want to see mistakes you see the negative things those Spirits have not died brethren OS but also of the good spirits that were in that time that Holy people the people that were consecrated that also passed from one generation to another generation we are the children of the prophets we are Kings and Priests we are the people of God foreign you have to be more spiritual that's the most beautiful thing the devil can imitate any gifts but not the Divine love no puede brother Tim you cannot do that he would be a hypocrite you can see that right away foreign foreign but the heart we do not know I know Henry brother Henry there's a good Mexican chains Columbia has some real good ones also we have maybe haven't heard them yet they also have good sayings in Colombia it's true we see the faces should be clean the holy spirit is here he can come that great sweeper that he has he can take out anything whatever anointing that whatever it is a little bit of time left he's going to be burnt together with his angels together with all of them that are doing bad things the word I know tears that are causing divisions among the people of God they're going to be burned they're going to be burnt I don't want to be burnt give Robert just your little finger before it hurts does it hurt a lot of you no no you don't know God did not call us for that service and handmaidens of the Lord to be a United people to back up the work to pray for one another to help one another for which God called US foreign and what does that have to do with it rivalry there are many rivalries you should not be rivalries Among Us we need more of the love of God in our lives it's like to read this letter foreign [Music] will also collide with misunderstanding and Prejudice of the in the world and I ask you to guard the letters as long as necessary years decades until Society is events enough to accept what I will explain below identification there is an extremely powerful force that so far science has not found a formal explanation to you it is a force that includes and governs all others and is even be behind in any phenomenon operating in the universe and has not yet been identified by us is when scientists looked for a unified theory of the universe they forgot the most powerful unseen Force love is light that enlightens those who give and receive it love is gravity because it makes some people feel attracted to others love is power because it multiplies the best we have and allows Humanity not to be extinguished in their blind selfishness love unfolds and reveals for love we live and die Love Is God and God is love celebrity the this Force explains everything and gives meaning to life this is the variable that we have ignored for too long maybe because we are afraid of love because it is the only energy in the universe that man has not learned to drive at will to give visibility to love it and I have made a simple substitution in the most famous equation or equals mc2 we accept that the energy to heal the world can be obtained to love multiplied by the speed of light squared we arrive at the conclusion that love is the most powerful force there is because it has no limits foreign in use in control of other forces of the universe that have turned against us it is urgent that we nourish ourselves with another kind of energy if we want our species to survive if we had to find a meaning in life if we want to save the world and every sent in it being that it happens that love is the one and only answer he says perhaps we are not yet ready to make a bomb of Love is powerful enough to

that get up here and they say Lord uh put me to one side that's okay I guess it's not God's job it's your job to put yourself it's a sacrifice yes sacrificio hours upon hours of studying and meditating to get our hearts right so that God can speak through us thank you brother Tim for letting Jesus speak to us yes brother brother David thank you for letting Jesus speak to US foreign that was the only problem I had with brother Tim's message yesterday I don't know if they'll invite me back that's why I said foreign [Music] [Applause] we have something we want to do before we leave and I want to ask brother Tim Garcia senior brother Tim Garcia Jr Jr brother Lorenzo Garcia Jr brother Aaron Esquivel I'm going to ask them if they would come this morning and we have an ordination of ministers you would come the person the wonderful thing when when a man hears the call of God Hermos and they eat eat the call man these are not man called men amen you love the Lord amen I want to read a scripture portion of scripture in the book of Isaiah the sixth chapter I'm just going to read it in English just to save some time Isaiah 6. verses one through eight say yes in the year that King uziah died I saw also the Lord sitting upon a throne high and lifted up and his train filled the temple above its stood the seraphims each one had six wings with Twain he covered his face and with Wayne he covered his feet and with Twain he did fly and one Cried unto another and said holy holy holy is the Lord of hosts the whole earth is full of his glory and the post of the door moved at the voice of him that cried in the house was filled with smoke I want you to I'm going to read from verse 5 to verse 8 and then you can read those also okay then said I woe is me for I am undone because I am a man of unclean lips and dwell in the midst of a people of unclean lips or mine eyes have seen the king the Lord of hosts is then flew one of the seraphims unto me having a live coal in his hand which he had taken with the tongs from off the altar foreign and he laid it upon my mouth and said Lo this hath touched my thy lips and thine iniquity is taken away and thy sin purged he is also I heard the voice of the Lord saying whom shall I send and who will go for us then said I hear am I send me in a Queens Mark the 16th chapter verse 15 through 18. and he said unto them go ye into all the world and preach the gospel to every creature he that believeth and is baptized shall be saved but he that believeth not shall be damned and these signs shall follow them that believe in my name they shall cast out Devils they shall speak with new tongues they shall take up serpents and if they drink any daily thing they sh it shall not hurt them they shall lay hands on the sick and they shall recovering I'm going to ask if if the ministry would come at this time oh God even if you're not from church here would you help David in the message ordination says that's exactly the way they did it in the Bible times was lay hands upon them in ordination they laid hands upon the deacons they put them in the church everything was by the lean on of hands not signing up a bunch of papers and joining a certain Creed no Fernando papelles or something like that or they laid hands on and turned him loose in the Holy Spirit and let him go amen amen God led him in the way he wants to that's all that's the way we believe in doing it if you got a commission from God you got an ordination from God to do these things when we lay hands on them we aren't giving them their gifts we aren't giving them their Ministry that was all already placed by God in them from before the foundation of the to sanction them because we have recognized that there is a gift there so they might ask you four
