each one of you those that are online god bless you this morning amen and then the the electricity they said went out this morning here look let's without further ado let's get into the word see what the lord has for us this morning we're looking forward to a good time this afternoon thomas and brother william will be giving a report on norway and it reads like this behold i will send you elijah the prophet before the coming of the great and dreadful day of the lord and he shall turn the heart of the fathers to the children and the heart of the children to their fathers lest i come and smite the earth with a curse lord i have nothing to do with this put myself to one side lord and ask that you would use your servant today may your children be blessed they go home lord with their with their hearts their cups overflowing bring changes in our lives lord where it is necessary to have come bless them for their efforts all said and done lord we will give you the honor and all the glory it is the name of jesus christ please amen amen you may be seated amen amen who was this elijah we have heard many messages many many messages on elijah is that right you got your notebooks ready you make sure that you write these things down where was he born and donde nacional where did he come from what are his characteristics let's find out real quick in first kings 17 and verse one how many know that there's not a whole lot about elijah where he came from but we know right away in verse one it says and elijah the tishbite who was of the inhabitants of gilead and that's all we know about it we find out he comes right into the palace and he tells ahab okay it's but other than that there's no record of his genealogy and there's a reason for that is that right no record of who his father was uh she was a candidate no record of who his mother was he was a prophet a miracle worker he lived in the northern part or the northern kingdom of israel during the reign of king ahab and his queen jezebel now elijah in the greek can someone tell me what elijah and the greek is can you help me out here elijah and the greek what what would it be in griego maybe you had a worse week than i did he says not that mine was bad maybe you had a rough week okay somebody i i somebody got to answer me this morning elijah and the greek is what elias you better phone a friend or some something this morning thanks guys appreciate that and the greek is elias well somebody could have read it at least elijah once again in the greek is elias elias and elijah means and this is so important to the message yahweh is my god or yahweh yeah or my god is jehovah says this is very important to understand the message here in a little bit i want you to tell your neighbor neighbor elijah means my god is jehovah okay this is this is so important for the message now this man's characteristics were so amazing that even jesus was thought of as possibly being elijah reincarnated i mean stop for a moment that's the messiah the christ many thought that he maybe could be elias come back again when jesus asked his disciples who do men say that i the son of man that was their answer right say that you're john the baptist some say that you are elias jeremias or one of the prophets and this spirit of elijah speed today there has to be souls associated or so bound to christ that you you can't even tell the difference i don't know about you but i want my spirit so close to christ they can't tell the difference between us and christ and god loved the spirit of elijah so much that he used it five times now i won't ask you that because the guys already put it up but let's go over them just real quick we we know them by by heart already but number one elijah the tishbite can you can you say it with me elijah the tishbite number two elisha number three john the baptist number four elijah to the gentiles and number five elijah to the jews again for a moment we're gonna we're gonna focus on the third coming of the spirit of elijah and that is in john the baptist how many know that he was the first the forerunner of the first coming of the lord amen those are kindergarten questions we'll get to the primary ones a little john the baptist forerunned the first coming of the lord but he couldn't do the job of forerunner by himself i mean think about that for a moment here comes a man on the scene john the baptist but there was certain characteristics or qualities that he needed that he didn't have and so therefore anton says we see the spirit of elijah coming upon john juan once again the spirit of elijah is coming upon john ellis to help him forerun the first coming of the lord he needed the spirit of elijah on him watch this now matthew eleventh chapter and verse seven mateo when you have it you can say man you need to stretch a little bit i think you need to wake up a little bit more and as they departed this is verse seven per society jesus began to tell to say unto the multitudes concerning john i think he's asking the same questions today what do you go what do you go to church looking for a queue and more than a prophet for this is he of whom it is written and this so the first thing jesus does jesus he places john the baptist in the scriptures amen or amen amen once again the first thing he does he places him in the scripture but they cannot place john the baptist in those scriptures so the word which is jesus christ to place him in the scriptures whoa and they're like whoa it isn't wow we didn't catch that when we read malachi 3. no captain he said he is the one that would come to make the path straight to prepare the way before me i'm just i'm just voting he's the one that would prepare the way hey el camino he is my forerunner el esme precusor now now this is important because after john had identified jesus jesus the lamb of god takes away the sins of the world brother branham says his eagle i had filmed over a bit he begins to imprison he he calls his disciples that are visiting him and he says go and ask the christians [Music] he's thinking about the prophet malachi and what he prophesied because john the baptist knew what malachi had prophesied and him knowing that he is another oh esperamo now jesus never told them to tell john that he was the one jesus that's unlike most people today huh escomo i'm the one i'm the one you're looking for yeah that's me not jesus no jesus he begins to tell them he answered them and said unto them they answered and said unto them watch how he's approaching john now this is important he's approaching john knowing that elijah was a miracle worker so that's how he's approaching him the blind received their sight and the lame walk the lepers are cleansed and the death here the dead are raised up and the poor have the gospel preached today why did jesus tell him that because elijah did miracles and in john's heart ah this is this is good stuff now watch this now es esta bueno matthew 11 verse 11. verso jesus continues and says verily i say unto you among them that are born of women there hath not risen a greater than john the baptist wouldn't that include elijah no including us would it well we don't know who his mama was but we don't know who his papa was which was for to come in other words jesus just made a declaration jesus not about himself what about this man john jesus said he is this kind of gets a little bit um makes you scratch your head a little bit but jesus was not telling them that john was elijah the tishbite jesus but what he's saying is that the spirit that was in john juan but that that spirit is espiritu on john juan was forerunning the coming word or the messiah and jesus is pointing to the forerunner [Music] he was pointing to the forerunner that was prophesied to come so it almost looks like john and jesus jesus the forerunner and the christ christo are not on the same page that's hard to to think about that here's christ jesus you see the religious people of that day knew the scriptures because they couldn't place him in the scriptures they got confused john chapter 1 verse 19. juan capitulo and this is the record of john how many of you have a record you know you can have a good record too not just a bad record this is the record of john when the jews sent priests and levites from jerusalem to ask him who i'm not the messiah but now they're asking john jesus said he was elias the elias that was to come and john said i am not juan dijon arthou that prophet nope no watch jesus said that said he was he said john said he's not but notice the way that jesus said it and i'm going to go back to verse 14. he's talking about john avlando juan but then he says if ye will receive it it never says if you will receive him no iel this is this is good watch this now if ye will receive it what is it the no no you're making me an antichrist because what he's and what john was saying elias rather than the spirit that was anointing the man and that's why so many people even today they say you people think that brother branham is elijah no no he was not the tishbite but if you can receive it amen come on but if you can't receive it this is the elias behold i send you elijah the prophet before the coming of the great and dreadful day of the lord let's put it like this if i wanted to write music i would want the spirit of beethoven on me right yes see or some other artist that you like if i had the spirit of dillinger brother branham says i would be a thief and a killer yesterday the question is being asked to you know are you me and it's too yo i said yo oh you're good okay you are you and i am me yeah all right who are you why do we act like everybody else [Music] we act like the world we dress like the world we live like the world who are almost yeah it's like the people in church and i live like the people actually sometimes we get the spirit of the pastor rather than the holy spirit then the spirit that john the baptist had and that william and that's why that spirit will always stand up and bring corrections he turned and says it's not lawful for you to have your brother's wife corrects the error but nowadays you don't find it they are no longer the homes not in the churches nowadays you can't tell people they'll fly off the handle just like that i'm not going to church why you didn't like the spirit of elijah no elias come on did it go against your thinking let me ask you a question why did eli the high priest why did his sons get in trouble and leo they were doing all kinds of stuff in the temple that they shouldn't be doing you know why they did that because eli babied them too much oh you all were part of that we'll go here and there and everybody was excited i'm so tired of services maybe you should go and make it not a service he says maybe you should make it a relationship because when it's a relationship you know no matter what you got to go important there with him i want to be there with the body and sometimes the sister said well brother why can't you just get up there and say we a sister in your church older sister in my church a certain family in your church that is sickening to my stomach and i say where's the correction for that you understand now elijah elias just call it out he said you're the one that did that look i know who you are but yet giving a little grace you say go correct that sister you know what you're talking about go and correct that it's a sister from fort collins that was told that so just so that you know who you are wow wow would trash another family in their own church let themselves look good oh come on where's the spirit of elias we gotta get it right church we stand here sometimes you wanna preach nice messages nobody wants the corrections [Music] it was to the bobbed hair women the denominations god loved because love is correct but we don't want to be corrected well let's start being correct i deal really the other person did the same thing talking to each other let me get off that because then i will get into the rest of my message said he said i am the voice of one crying in the wilderness and now the scribes had read this portion of scripture before identification read the part of elijah but they had never seen the name it's the same as when the seals were opened it didn't declare the name only the position of the body of christ feel those things that the seven thunders uttered and write them not say yes i will reveal them in my time watch the spirit of elijah in action there will be no rain until i call for you in other words there will be no thunder either no until i call for it there will be no do until i call foreign so he must have been the father of the reign hath the reign of father or who have begotten the dru the drops of dew tine this is first kings chapter 18 verse 43 and he said to his servant go up now look toward the sea and he went up and looked and said there's nothing and he said go again seven times and on the seventh time he knew where he had to go think about this is all pipes and shadows now on the seventh time or the seventh angel messenger it came to pass at the seventh time that's when he saw behold i see there arises a little cloud out of the sea or the people it's like a man's hand and he said go up this is the super and say unto ahab prepare thy chariot preparation and the hand of the lord was on elijah and he girded up his loins and ran before ahab to the entrance of jezreel so or how many of you can say the message got to me the sowing got to me before ahab got there before jezebel got there the message got to me are you sure it got to you because if not why then do the scribes say then that elias must first come antos truly elijah shall first come and restore all things was to turn the hearts of the fathers to the children and the hearts of the children back to the father but it could not be done without the spirit of elijah are you are you hearing me without that spirit of elijah we never would have received the message we never would have received the word that's what the spirit of elijah did notice this now the old orthodox order is what what was here but when christ came here he never broke the law he only fulfilled the law and he brought forth a new covenant that the same spirit of elijah that it took to turn the hearts of the fathers to the children is the same spirit of elijah spirit that it takes to turn the hearts of the children back to their father jews can receive the same message the bible doesn't say that elijah saw the seventh angel it says that he saw the cloud where someone was coming he knew that he had to accompany the seven things this is just stop for a moment here because i wanted to get this he knew that he had to accompany yes they do see imagine moses and elijah imagine having a conference in the conference conference yes what about you moses oh moses says i'm a lawgiver that's the spirit of elijah he was a prophet to all nations but he was a prophet to all the gentiles the message has gone forth around the world watch this now pikacy you say well elias or elijah was just a man yes he was cecilia james 517 tells us santiago cinco de si elias was a man subject to like passion and we're taught in the scriptures that elijah was not an immortal being did you get that lo elijah was not an immortal being he was a man subject to like passion has oh i think we need a lot of help in the praying earnestly god help us to pray earnestly but elijah never died because before he he would die he was taken in a chariot by a whirlwind for the spirit that was of elijah is [Music] notice this now he could say we this is in the message spiritual foot in due season is the same porquez el mismo i'm going to believe the message that brother branham brought him up then are you one and the same with it do you love the spirit of elijah a denominational man under denominational auspices a theologian under theology they're all one with their messages but then when a man comes with thus saith the lord he and the message is one eliot and when elijah come with thus saith the lord he and his message became one just as jesus jesus when he comes he was the word the word we have come in the spirit of elijah el espirito delias now a lot of people won't take that in the message i don't come every sunday domingo perez como caleb perez if i did lucia i come wrong i don't go to the places the lord sends us the men don't go as their names and who they are i am not a separate entity from the message and that spirit or anointing of elijah speak to him i'm going to tell you has not left us because the message and the messenger are one in the senate and god takes the man but never his spirit oh but yet he was not just the man on hombre i see these things and i say wow lord help us help me to understand these things better we're coming around the corner matthew 27. 46. and grace always says dad you didn't say it right grace my god my god why has thou forsaken me and some of them that stood there when they heard that they said this man calls for elias why would jesus the word be calling for a mortal man yesterday don't make sense to me my god my god why hast thou forsaken me oh what she said the wrestler they say let be let's see whether elias will come to save him mark 15 tells us marco the same story let us see whether elias will come to take him down jesus did not die as god jesus he died as a man spirit went back to the father paul went to preach in the in the prisons of hell oh i want to know that this morning this is where the message comes together nowadays follow me once again elijah elias means my god is jehovah says watch why it had to be elijah my god is one with his family i am the and then he says jehovah means [Music] and he made man an amateur guy so he isn't self-existent do you think he wanted elijah to come take him off the cross it was his thou forsaken there was a separation from the son and the father but only because through that sacrifice could the family of god be restored to the rightful place where was the family of jehovah we were in we were in jeopardy of losing the whole world was given to his children as or if the lamb would not come forth notice this now can i have just a few more minutes i don't even know when i started just a few more minutes let me just finish this my god is jehovah media and jehovah of the old testamento is jesus of the new yes jesus oh my my mind oh there's meal and i can hear him once again crying why is that not forsaking me not to save him as we think but save him from being alone again restoration or only through the spirit of elijah could a prophet come through the ministry of the son of man it would be manifested again that wasn't elijah yes watch what he's saying now he's talking about elijah doing the miracles and all that he did in his life that wasn't elijah that was the spirit of god on elijah yes elijah was just a man now we've had elijah's coats everything elijah according to matthews or luke 17 30. man is to be revealed again not a man it'll come through a prophet the immortal elijah is immortal i'm going to say it again you having some issues in your family having issues at home immortal elijah let him come in correction you'll see some results don't go to the cross but before he went he said i pray for them i pray not for the world but for them which thou has given me they are mine through thine own name those whom thou has given that they may be one as we are one while i was with him in the world i kept them in thy name and none of them is lost but the son of perdition might be fulfilled verse 21 that they all may be one person that they also may be one in us the world may believe that thou has sent one she said i dreamed i was out west country and when i looked standing upon a hillary there was a real old man aviona with a long white beard and what hair he had was grown down across his face when she got closer she recognized who it was brother braham says you know why moses is immortal do you know why elijah is immortal today because he accepted the leadership of christ [Music] she said i must speak to him says what do you want oh yo it was me your dream was fulfilled right there sister steffi hermanos immediately after that but [Applause] when people in the same congregation just can't get along congregation i don't have to say no more to each one you're nothing okay now if you can believe
