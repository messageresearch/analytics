[36:08] a part where God will not condemn you do
[36:11] not rock on the not for what you do okay

[36:28] like a diabetes como el diabetes
[36:30] diabetes diabetes what is diabetes

[36:52] particular a no spiritual with bad
[36:54] habits some elaborate or okay
[36:56] eventually event one mentor you'll
[37:01] you'll you'll get to the point of the
[37:03] gala point of where this is another
[37:06] quality details the moment in that I
[37:08] but it's type 2 diabetes is 90% of
[37:10] people's problems get ready start people
[37:12] does it fit for my Grande and it's with
[37:15] it whether the sugars are too elevated

[37:36] through the neck sorry you know the
[37:40] blood sugar is blood sugar is too high
[37:42] let's look at the tongue angrily took us

[40:44] this this is now we have to find out our
[40:47] why the number came contact north report
[40:50] K we have a lot of and he used the
[40:52] example of at the company Apple a look
[40:55] store lock opening at the Apple and it
[40:58] says this he says Apple is there so

[41:17] niche of people that are diehards I
[41:19] moved on tickets or naam ke sonar are
[41:23] fifty miles so they don't stick to match
[41:27] no matter what the Cal connect a company
[41:28] a Mac watch watch what he explains real
[41:31] expla cocky he says everyone else's
[41:33] approach
[41:36] la la manera que hace la gente las
[41:39] compañías because this is this is what
[41:42] they say this is this is how they
[41:44] conduct their marketing okay I've become
[41:46] a veneer for Martin through compañías we
[41:48] make great computers and thermogram de
[41:50] computadora they're beautifully designed
[41:51] the more water there allows
[41:53] user-friendly possible sir Parvati Patil
[41:57] sir do you wanna buy one can a comprar

[42:11] status quo todo caramel caramel in Greta
[42:14] in Redondo Oh SSO las casas that's a lot
[42:22] process we believe in thinking
[42:26] differently grammar tape entire and
[42:28] different differences and how how we
