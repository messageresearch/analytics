get right into the word I hope nobody's in a hurry this morning we're not in a hurry this morning and so we want to hit number five on the worship the true worshiper o the subtitle there was war in heaven so we pray that it is a blessing that it helps you this morning we can turn in our Bibles to the book of Saint John the fourth chapter and I made a bad boo-boo yesterday it was my aunt's birthday there she is and my wife told me and she told me again I got busy and then I got to bed and I was like one of those moments oh my God forgot she's gonna get me so I owe you I owe you yeah amen happy birthday amen uh two two scriptures we're going to read as we enter this this subject we've been reading John 4 23.3 and it says but the hour cometh and now is when the true worshipers shall worship the father in spirit and in truth or the father seeketh such to worship Him Revelations 12 7 revelation we have hurts many many messages on this through the through the years and uh from our our uh our Prophet founding pastor Pastor our Elder here did this many times and so it's kind of like a it's kind of like a review but it's so important in the day and age that we live in now so you may have you may hear many things over and over again but it's building up to something today there was war in heaven Lord willing next Sunday there was war on Earth let's build up to next Sunday of the Lord willing today we're going to focus on the war that was in heaven the Bible reads like this Revelations 12 7 and 8 reads and there was war in heaven can you tell your neighbor that make sure that he he knows what what we're talking about today there was war in heaven tell your neighbor say neighbor don't forget this who was fighting in this war the Bible says Michael and his angels Miguel is Los Angeles fought against the Dragon and the dragon fought and his angels and prevailed not neither was their place found any more in heaven is you notice it doesn't say t-h-e-r-e right and neither was their place no neither was it their place bound anymore in heaven they lost their first estate may God add His blessings to the reading of his word you may be seated once again can we all say it together and there was war in heaven we have a real enemy the name is we have to know our enemy is that right we have to know our enemy so that we are not deceived it is the most deceptive age that there has ever been is right now and the only way not to be deceived and the only ones that will not be deceived we know is the word bride amen make sure you you you write that down the word bride are the only ones that will not be deceived she knows the enemies she knows where he comes from she's followed that trail and she knows the way her enemy is brother Sammy was was uh had sent me something the other a couple days ago he asked me if I had ever heard of it's called the Blue beam projects it's like so many other things a a conspiracy theory that states that NASA and the United Nations and along with the antichristo that supposedly they're going to try and simulate question the second coming of the Lord Jesus in the sky they'll be using satellite images or satellites I should say different different instruments in order to deceive the people and uh and this will help them establish they say the New World Order yes so accordingly they're going to have these images coming down from heaven and that's the way they're going to say look Jesus is here and and so forth they don't have to go through all that trouble the Bible says there was war in heaven and like brother Abraham says it wasn't a war with swords and Spears it wasn't a war with guns and bombs somebody help me out what kind of war was it spiritual war he says okay spiritual and what else all right it was a war of words it was a war of messages it was a Lucifer and Michael going at it and if someone had a message now now this is what we want to really focus on through thousands upon thousands uh these years that have passed onions many conspiracy theories and things have Arisen Through The Years rising up many claiming to be the Messiah recently I don't know if you if you if you follow it or not a certain Rabbi has has risen up in in Israel done a few Miracles many are saying he is the Messiah and people throughout the the the years as I said predicted that when the second coming of the Lord would be and have failed miserably many have claimed to be the Elijah many many of them and today many even claimed to be an eighth messenger but we are taught that we should not eat anything if it is not scriptural I know that right is that right if it's not scriptural I don't care how good it sounds we are not going to eat it but the thing about it is that even through all this there are so many people in the world that are deceived today because they don't know how to check it with the words I say it this morning church do not be deceived it's all about the Battle for your soul foreign [Applause] yes it's a battle for the soul of men yes and it didn't just start yesterday or the day you were born I want everybody to understand this it didn't just start last week this swore the Bible says started in heaven now your neighbor neighbor it started in heaven and sometimes we feel like we're some that we're special in this way nobody has had the struggles that I have had is that right anybody ever thought that nobody's ever had a life harder than mine let me tell you a news flash this morning foreign yes or yes okay so don't feel like you're the only one that's just that's that's it in a battle right now oh no everyone every especially every child of God we are going to this battle if we know know how Lucifer did things in the beginning then we cannot be deceived at the end we've got to know our enemies and if we know what he did in the beginning we'll know exactly the way he'll do things at the end don't get confused about changing of horses don't get confused about changing of mass it's still here it's obviously look at the characteristics look at what he's trying to accomplish all right so are we ready for this message let's jump in and see what the Lord has for us is characteristics his goals are the same is he Longs and desires to be worshiped and the only ones that will recognize this is the Bride of Jesus Christ everyone else the Bible says everyone whose names were not written on the Lamb's Book of Life it don't matter how religious no matter what church you go it don't matter how long you've been in the message everyone whose names are not written on the Lamb's Book of Life everyone will be deceived notice this this is the message Christ is the mystery of God revealed notice in this last days he's talking about these are the last days right it says Lucifer is doing the same thing so if he's doing the same thing let me go back and see what he was [Music] brother Reuben we talked about this two Sundays ago we're talking about putting our name there right okay so who is he saying can you see it too are you sure yeah sisters hermanitas who is he talking about with the Boaz who's he talking ah good job brother Bo you have to put your name and here he's saying yeah and I put my name Caleb is he said can you see it he's trying to keep us from being deceived and so we have to put our name in the last days Lucifer is doing the same thing Caleb can you see it and I read this and then I say oh I can see it Prophet amen he's asking the question to me and you see it and then he goes on the devil doing the same thing he just repackages it in different ways building up a hybrid Church by hybrid members hybrid by knowledge even if it is instead of born-againment oh this this is he's building an intellectual Kingdom and nowadays that's what people want intellectuals they want someone that has a lot of intellect I can tell them really nice words and the people are looking for that why because it's a day of much knowledge that has increased it's an intellectual Kingdom that they're building that will outshine Christ's little bitty flock imagine that it will outshine Christ's little bitty why have we come to where we're at today and then he says fallen angels okay we're finding who our enemy is because we was done with letting the enemy come in and ruin our lives are sick and tired of getting kicked in the guts it just seemed like the enemy just comes in and boom boom boom but what he says what's going on it's these Fallen names there was war in heaven the Bible said it was Fallen Angels who listen to Lucifer instead of Christ and then he says who they once belong to oh my goodness these Fallen Angels listen to Lucifer surprise who they once belong to Now isn't that the same thing today is that when those Fallen Angels come to anoint someone what do they do they began to listen to Lucifer rather than to Christ who they once were they belong to him is that right let's go back to the beginning then when God created these angels He created them to worship him oh my here we are we're talking about the true worshiper now he created these angels to worship him and he made different kinds of angels He made archangels seraphims different orders of Angels On and On we can go on the different kinds of angels these angels are amazing who worship all right I want you to get this once again these angels estos Angeles are amazing you talk about knowing how to worship they were made for that sometimes we can't even raise our hand in church hello everybody hola sometimes we feel like we've been run over by a steamroller wonderful Wow way to go oh my gosh I do think you that's all they do that's what they do it's Lucas they worship Him watch how tremendous this is those spirits that come from the Throne of God they're around the throne and they come from the Throne of God and they stand Before the Throne of God how many of you could stand Before the Throne of God oh come on now we're Christians we're going in a Rapture can you stand Before the Throne his Angel stood Before the Throne of God this is in the message this is questions and answers on Hebrews and billions and billions and Aeons of time before the world even began they were in the presence of God and then he says do you think they don't know something about worship foreign why what have we missed come on now what have we missed as true worshipers we are too Earthbound our focus is on material things yes or yes COC look look we have our little habits we should no more here people have their little habits real things on the side blah blah blah at the end of the day let me ask you what do you know about worship let's stop there for a moment because we take it for granted that people understand so ask yourself the question what do I really know about worship billions and billions of years these angels worship what do I know about it this is what we know about worship yes we're back home in the same atmosphere aren't we missing something you put on a tape every now and then we pray every now and then but we're worshipers everyone whose name is not on that Lamb's Book of Life how many of you have his Worship in you what happened come on think about this he's gonna let you go today until we have gone to the soul we answer that question today do I know about worship ah come on it has nothing to do with religion nothing hello everybody we think because we're religious that we are worshipers all these angels worshiped him for billions of years don't do you think they don't know something about worship but then they fell and they come down and they get right into man watch this now they get right into man and they worship God yes oh oh this is gonna get hot that's all I know I'm gonna say it again they come down they get into man brother Bradham says Cain was a worshiper also absolutely absolutely they worship God and they have a knowledge of God because they have been around the throne and they're smart and educated but God rejected them from the beginning my goodness this that's that's a that's a mouthful I don't know if if you're ready for this message hear these fallen angels and they'll make you worship no matter what what condition you're in oh yeah they'll make they know something about words so therefore he says friend Amigo membership of a church knowledge of some theology doesn't have one thing to do with it it's got to be the blood of Jesus Christ joins you to him as one person he says there you are yeah oh okay oh see there are the angels and God is yours and the spirit that's joined with God there's one Spirit my question is is your spirit joined to him if it is it's one Spirit now the spirit of God that God knew before the foundation they rejected the devil's life and that Spirit yes take a body of Flesh to come and be tested he says to take his testing hmm so now we know we're being tested this is ABC's right yes sir see in doing this watch our founding Pastor here but in all things we go we go to the to the drama in heaven now is Lucifer are you ready let's go into heaven I love it when brother Brown would say just go back with me many questions of years ago before the world was ever formed let's go way back how many want to take a trip this morning but in all this is he made one angel that was bigger more beautiful than anybody else how many think you're beautiful never mind I'm gonna I'm gonna get off on these on these exits and I can't get back on don't listen okay he was more beautiful than anybody else he was the son of the morning the one called Lucifer Lucifer best looking of all the angels Los Angeles Michael was big pretty good looking but not as good looking out yes and he put charged he put in charge Lucifer and Michael a Miguel de Lucifer and God knowing what he was doing God knew what he was doing the whole time there was nothing or there was something in Lucifer that God had put in there that I want you to watch this God knowing what he was doing there was something in Lucifer and Lucifer that he didn't put in Michael okay no puso and Miguel so because of this little thing God put in Lucifer Lucifer exalted himself watch it watch it he says when you ask for a gift gifts can fail but the word cannot failure in other words Lucifer had a special little gift in him while Michael had the word like that again Lucifer had a little special gift in here but Michael had the word in here this little bitty thing of Lucifer it interfered with Michael he would look around he would say I'm better looking than Michael just to imagine nobody ever do that be careful you know what spirit is I'm better looking than Michael I'm a little bigger than him probably laugh at me my spiritual man though and there was war in heaven the right-hand man of man of God Almighty was Lucifer son of the morning and God granted him almost co-workers with him he was a co-worker partly equal with him because now Church you want to know who your enemy is going into this there was war in heaven that war has come down to earth yes and if you know him back then you'll know him today characteristics all this Satan could not create saying could not create God is the only Creator but Satan took something that God created and he perverted it back into something else to God number two is but he saw Michael Miguel Michael had something in him he had the word and the first thing that Lucifer does oh is the same thing we do nowadays we get jealous and why do they have watch him he was not content with what God had given us we wanted to be greater than God he wanted to be the one that everybody revered he wanted to be worshiped but he was jealous about about Michael notice this now oh I like this Lucifer's lust for power blessed to have more it's lost to have what Michael has and that began his downfall yes there was war in heaven and what does he do he cast it he betrays Michael Miguel and he began to make himself brother Branham says he begins to make himself a great Kingdom in the north go back and hear the one that's uh that brother Abraham preached on like the sides of the north and why he took all that I'm after something here you see it should have only been one Kingdom but jealousy and betrayal caused him to set up his own kingdom oh my it's no different in the churches today jealousy and betrayal we can have every excuse why we do what we do the end of the day you're either anointed by Michael or by luciferous well this I don't you know what there is another anointing oh I don't know if that one's set really good or not jealousy and betrayal cause people to go and want to set up their own kingdom no uh jealousy and betrayal causes people yeah we're going to want to get rather do their own kingdom Lucifer doing the same thing today do you know what caused the first battle in heaven come on now all these things you got to get all this so that we understand the end you know what caused the first battle in heaven this is the message let your light so shine before men was when Lucifer Lucifer set up a greater class of people Grande he got a better class of angels or so he thought huh big Grande bigger Kingdom a more brighter shinier Kingdom than Michael had okay yes Lucifer the son of the morning exalted himself in Beauty and wanted a more beautiful kingdom than that of Michaels because he thought that God dwelt in Beauty Lucifer had a beautiful kingdom when he came in everyone all the Angels began to look at him and say wow episode wow he's impressive check him out El Impressions this is a battle of war going on in heaven so he looks at this all these angels these angels that were that were under in his kingdomeness Lucifer Lucifer they'd see him and they would say he's awesome this man this creature whatever they would call him he's so beautiful that's the way a lot of preachers a lot of churches think today muchas Iglesias they think that they're the greatest where did that Spirit come from sorry I don't laugh I'm not laughing at you I'm laughing at the Devil Diablo we're the greatest no one likes us where did that filthy dirty Spirit come from there is nothing great except that the Lord Jesus Christ he is the great one he has come to dwell in his church the holy church the holy God in the church it's the holy God in the church it's not the Holy Mountain it's the holy God that comes down to the mountains your holy ghost that comes to the heart of them where are these Spirits fallen angels everybody okay with me so far we're going through a drama here yes Lucifer at the beginning his purpose was to achieve a brighter and greater thing in heaven than Christ then Christ happened is that right by seemingly a more cultured more beautiful more splendors yeah wow the Bible says in Ezekiel 38 full of wisdom perfect in Beauty perfect that's our enemy is tell your neighbor neighbor yeah wow full of wisdom and perfect and Beauty now Lucifer means he was the most beautiful of any being that God had created only I think it Lucifer's I think it's only mentioned one time in the Bible talked about in different places but in Isaiah chapter 14. this prophet Isaiah it says how are thou fallen from Heaven oh Lucifer son of the morning how art thou cut down to the ground which did weaken the Nations were taught in English most of the time when a a sentence starts with how well it's usually a question but if you notice here there is no question mark because these are not two questions that the prophet is asking he's not asking how art thou fallen from Heaven he's not saying that we already know how he fell from him he was cast down from him but he's there's an exclamation mark in both of these sentences he says how art thou fallen from Heaven oh Lucifer son of the morning but he's making an exclamation at an exclamation mark or point it always denotes a strong emotions this Prophet is saying this is a strong emotions something that has rocked his world that it's hard to understand how such a creature of such beauty how could you fall down from heaven you are number two with God you could do everything except create Isaiah can't capture how is it possible that you would fall what an emotion is going on here the same thing when brother Bradham preaches the message there's an emotion there when he's giving you the Holy Ghost paid the price on the cross why would you turn it down I'm here with me are you getting what Isaiah is talking about because he said he said yes you had everything you had Beauty again you had Charisma you have the respect of the Angels you had a position you had everything how are thou fallen from him what emotion he's using to describe this and he uses two words to describe Lucifer's descent his descent Fallen okay he's this and cut down if it is cortado read it again say that again from Heaven yes it's weak in the nation if that happened to him what about us he continues with this strong emotion describing why the demise or the death of Lucifer as the right hand of God is describing why this happened there's such an emotion behind this as a prophet and now he's going to tell you the reason you ready listos verse 13. this is why you were cut down and you have followed foreign I will stop right there I will watch now because those angels must have had the ability to choose come on now this is important church it was important because sometimes we we we we're it's like we're fighting the air is we don't know how to fight the good fight he's telling us today how to fight this he said because thou has said in thine Hearts I will Ascend into heaven this that we're reading there are five Wills of Lucifer follow these things because when you find yourself dealing with these wheels I know exactly where what's going on here I will Ascend into heaven number one I will exalt my throne above the stars of God I will sit also upon the Mount of the congregation in the sides of the north I will Ascend above the height of the clouds and I will be like the most highest five wheels of Lucifer Lucifer that will yes shows once again that he could choose it expresses his will and that was the sin is yellow he figured out in control I can choose and I can have what I want well I'm going to say it again I can choose and I can do what I want the Brown says yeah you can do whatever you want yeah don't you think for a moment that when you think that you're making the choice on my own and I'm doing my own thing in life here we go on chop all my hair off oh where did you get that Spirit Michael never taught that Miguel then iniquity was founded foreign this is Satan's plan is these are the steps estas the stages of someone who wants to be worshiped I will I will I will I will I will be careful when you say I will I want kids what Spirit do you have okay but Michael on the other hand is never Associated we're speaking about his will yo it's always been God's perfect will um this is the war this is the battle in heaven Michael is always known as the one who stands oh come on now what's the difference in these Spirits the Bible says on that day Michael shall stand he said Michael is Christ Miguel es Cristo and while Lucifer was intent Lucifer he was intent elinto was being like the most highest the meaning of the name of Michael El Lombre significado de Miguel is not only a question but a declaration you think God named him Michael just to name him Michaels I have heard Minister say this I'm not throwing I'm just a statement here I've heard different ones that have said who is like God hmm and so we can preach a message that's not what Michael means come on now come on now I'm telling you here I want you to get this Captain there was war in heaven and the war was words what is my name what do you mean oh you know my name yeah the word Michael means who is like God question mark did you get that I'm gonna say it again the very name is a question it is the meaning of his name is like God no no no no no it's Lucifer wanted to be like God's name means question who is like God and it also means there is none like God think of that for a moment there's a war in heaven I'm gonna be like the most high God and Michael said no immigration no no one who is like God you know nobody like him no you don't want a battle of words Thou Art the anointed cherub that is portento and I I'm just going to read it in English to save some time here totally I have set these soul thou wasst upon the holy mountain of God thou has walked up and down in the midst of the stones of fire thou was perfect in thy ways from the day that thou was created till iniquity was found in thee iniquity knowing to do right right or knowing what's wrong still doing it yes now when we see this we see how this all started in heaven and the question is is this and this is the part that I just I can't wrap my mind around says sin started in heaven and there's some sin around the throne oh that's blowed my mind I can't put my mind around that no purpose so now it starts to get heated now now the battle is getting heated now ain't nobody like God but Lucifer thought he could do things a little better than God because you have to disbelieve first when you and your life understands to be there we think we can bring this message better than brother Brown watch it we just say do ya people think they don't need a profit no more like I said before how many years has it been Israel with with Moses 3000 3700. 3 500 years ago and that's still their profit 57 years after he's passed away I don't know if he's a prophetess no I just say wow really wow God began to unveil his plan his Plan of Redemption here we go he's gonna Place Mana Lombre on free moral agencies here's the battle now come on because we all deal with this we all deal with free moral ages we all have free moral ladies all right yeah is there somebody here that doesn't I know what you're going to say once I chose the Lord I don't have three moral agencies but until we get to that place we are still three moral agents okay so now here's the battle now it's not just about them too but now it's time for these angels that are listening let's see who's got a better message don't forget Lucifer had Charisma oh he could preach I don't know what else he could do but man he was scared he was charismatic charismatic and he could sway a person or an angel so here it starts inside plan me plan free moral agents and through that plan I want man I want Isaiah Isaiah I want them to choose okay how many here have free moral agency to choose maybe not some of you don't think you don't no much they made me come to church today I didn't want to come to church well yeah sometimes it's sometimes it seems pretty rough it's better for what's best for you young people old people he wanted man to choose to serve him get it close get it young people especially now Satan offers many things but God just simply wanted Bo I want Bo to choose put your name there put your name there I just want Lily to serve me she's coming at a rough time oh brother Noah you're coming at a rough time that's the hardest age there is no I've made Provisions for them but I want them to choose oh here's the fighting the one Angel angels over here they're wanting to know which side should I choose God begins to continues to unravel his plans to plan or open up his plan he then would go down he said and I'll go and I'll redeem man he says who return him back to me he would do the work of redemption therefore would fulfill the requirements of a kinsman redeemer to the human race and then after Redemption what would be fulfilled he would bring a message of restoration back to their original condition the redeemed man would be entitled to the claiming rights as a redeemed restored Son of God and all this would be done me gusta how many of you like that plan a way to get you back to him but what did Lucifer do but okay he gathered his angels and then said Michael come on bring your angels let's have a little debate Michael said I don't like debates well you preached the message first then and then I'll preach after years gather them together and then Lucifer's time came I want to show you all a better plan oh my God here we go here's the battle here's the war in heaven better plan than what God has why go through all the trouble problema why give them free moral agency just force them to do it force them to love you foreign are you why are you seeing this battle what's going on here in heaven moral agencies come on don't tell me that the same thing don't happen in the church don't tell me it's not the same thing that happens in the homes okay forced religion and we are very good at knowing about that is so they began to hear this he said a better plan the message adoption brother Brown says and Lucifer was the first one to take the wrong road he began to draw after him trying to take all for himself is Mio my um forget it watch this now quizzes here he goes and he began becomes hoggish by the random says taking all for himself and trying to override everyone else he thank you once again explain yourself Lucifer a little bit more why give them free moral agency why the cross wow why the suffering why the pain and the Lord the Lord and you want them your children to go through that we can skip the cross give them a better this is a better idea and nobody has to suffer what a battle going on I go down why would God have to go down and become a man one of the most asked questions today how can all powerful holy God stand there with his arms crossed watching all these men women and children suffer meaning how can he let bad things happen to good people everybody possible we don't need to do that don't let them suffering let's go my way just force Emma say Emma You're Gonna Love the Lord that's all there is to it on your mind I've made up your my mind your mind for you really and and Christ oh Michael Miguel and Michael says no no but those other Angels third of them that's a good idea erase the cross erase the suffering foreign don't we as humans many times when we're going through something rough suffering like this is I don't understand hard the hardships I was I born into this family my loved one pass away why did these things happen when I was a child in foster homes or whatever it might be foreign and what have we lost sight of is the chemist that we have lost it is sounded his plan sounded good Lucifers but they began to be swayed and I can hear Michael says the Lord rebuked me Brenda he knew that Lucifer's plan never compared to God's plan foreign Lucifer's plan there was no manifestation of Love Church I'm coming down now to the nitty-gritty there was no manifestation of love under Lucifer's plan there was no talk of Mercy there was no talk of Grace there was no talk of faith it was all absent from Lucifers do you see what he was trying to do setting up a forced religions he said you can just make man fallen and Michael says in Miguel this day make man fall asleep just so he can redeem him that's not just foreign never have come out foreign oh my God when I'm sir some of those angels with Michael stood up and said oh yeah we see it they go down to earth they're willing to even be sick is you know if we looked at things the right way because you agreed to it why am I suffering because you agree to it yeah why am I still so lost because you agreed to it Lord I'll pull those things out of you pull the attribution complain about it is [Music] who existed of himself but they knew nothing about the attributes you think God didn't know what he was doing it's something that Satan didn't catch when those attributes would be pulled out mine and your names were attached to it I'm going to say it again my name and yours was attached to that attribution this is why the Seven Seals that could not be preached until this end time God would send a prophet he would began to preach the same message that they heard from the beginning here's God what is he doing now I think he let Lucifer know all history no no no no no all those names who were attached to those attributes they were hidden Christ those names would not be revealed Until the End battle gets comes to earth now we're going to get there after next time can I have like 10 15 minutes there was war in heaven under forced religion attributes will never be pulled out but under free moral ages I want them to choose I love them but I want them to love me back and nobody forcing them foreign hello everybody thank you you see a forced religion right in you now to bring all the little groups into one great Unity they call it there was war in heaven he wanted to keep those attributes being expressed so that God wouldn't be worshiped by his family as I said in a in a way that he had never been worshiped no one had ever worshiped him as a savior no one had ever worshiped him as a Healer been sick to that point oh Michael's desire whole desire was for God to receive all honor and glory and praise that's why on the inside of your spirit is a soul and it's controlled by controlled by one thing is Faith or doubts you can accept what the devil says you can accept What God Says and that'll determine yes oh let me skip some of this I'll go and this is the message you've heard from the beginning and if that which you have heard from the beginning shall remain in you you also shall continue in the Sun and in the father and this is the promise that he have promised us yes eternal life now in adoption he says this watch what the battle continues you trinitarian Brotherhood I'm not wanting to hurt you but how in the name of the good word of God would you ever Place Jesus as being a separate person from God himself if Jesus could take another person make him go and die to redeem this person here would be an unjust being um there's only one way that God could ever do it would be to take the place himself God became flesh he's not asking you to do something that he didn't do himself come on now pinch yourself a little bit we're we're all we're almost done for the day he became flesh that he also might taste the Pains of death sting and death away from us that we might be Redeemed by his own and because he tasted of that that's why he'll be so worshiped at the end that's why the worship he'll receive at the end foreign our Buckler yellow what do we want to find out today is I'm going I'm coming around the corner what do we want to find out today I want to know what side my angel chose nothing else matters it doesn't matter how religious you are saying don't care about that but I want to know how many want to know that angel is your representation your heavenly representative don't forget that representations yes the Bible says awaken the gift that is because by that is the only way you can tell is there which kingdom you belong the only way is to examine the characteristic of the gene is [Applause] what's the characteristic of the gene that's inside oh that Gene can only put forth what it has inside of it some people can't help doing what they do they have no representation When I See This I realize entiendo the Bible says blessed is the man that sin is not imputed to him that's such a big thing churches blessed is that man is not impurities you see those angels that fell in the beginning by hearing Lucifer's lies because we fall in our flesh Oh What A Difference he made a way for you therefore we can repent the sin is not imputed to us because the day on Calvary we can handle it is did your angel sin we must find that out and that's why when you answer the sin blessed is that man years ago I'm going to tell you a few stories and then I'm gonna then I'm gonna stop it was war in heaven years ago and maybe some of you may remember this is a certain lady and I and I don't want to of course it's it doesn't matter who it is when she spoke she spoke not as a not as a lady's voice but it was a deep manly voice and I remember that that our pastor took a picture of brother Branham that one right there yes and put the picture right in front of it right away that demon said I'm on your eyes wow angry mad upset being in a rile that demon up and our pastor asked the question says why do you hate him so much he said because he cast me down the sister wouldn't have known that noise but that demon dude and he looks at him he says why do you hate me because you were with him in the beginning foreign but who are you come on now here we are now we become hitchhikers and then those demons jump on us and we we become their transportation we need to stop that is God's word calls for a total separation these Devils with us wherever we go and the dragon was cast out that old serpenter called The Devil in Satan who deceived the whole world passed out into the Earth his angels were cast out with him go back and listen to the message brother brother Branham preaches how the angel came to me come on now these are all these are all keys for you how that angel came to me foreign we could get into real deep stuff right here it's important to know where that angel came from says I don't doubt that Joseph Smith saw an angel but what that angel told him was not scripture and when I see that that angel that has come that brother Brandon would always wait for it that was the Heavenly Angels but when it would come down and he would say now I'm waiting for someone you know I'm waiting for him he's here right now and when he would he would say that now I take every Spirit under my control what happened you say brother have you ever met an angel I had an angel that it was sent to me that was to come at the end of the age I don't need to listen to a bunch of angels anymore messenger of the age then to bring what was in the back part of God if you would but I wanna I wanna end you with this and I have to just tell you this and it's the story of our founding pastors this is why it means so much to us you've heard it many times but it goes so well with this message he lived in tier C at the time when one day a big old angel came to Israel he said my mother there was Lane next to him he said and the angel he said was real big shoulders big arms he crossed them like this looking at me I wasn't asleep I was looking up at him and I saw this Angel very handsome he wasn't ugly it was a real handsome man I noticed that out of his arms he would stretch forth his arms it was like these feathers these things that were over him one of his arms he said would stretch very wide says and he says you will go this is all about forced religions no I will he said no come on church I'm showing you this is I want you to see I'm done now because I want you to see that we all have this struggle get back to him we've come to this hickey of time he made a way back to him every demon in hell to get your soul and and pull it to the other side I'm not the only one we all are going through this he said I'm ordering you to go our Pastor said I will not go that's why we loved his characters because he wouldn't take it not from the devil not from anyone he goes like this and he hits me this is his words foreign foreign brother Branham says he said it I felt so bad when I read the scripture no man comes the father draws him oh that saddened my heart is no one will come unless the father draws him he said but then he gave me a consolation all that the father has given me they will come and not a one will be lost he's not one of you will be lost you wouldn't understand didn't want you to do it yeah he says it is a perfect will soon he says here you come you can't even supply for your wife so please if you go and do this you'll have this and you can still go you can go out and preach but you got to do this I said no I won't no I won't later I found these angels watch me closely these angels we're spirits that had come into these preachers they would come and say they're a very poor man look at that little bitty Dotson you have they went to you says Ah we can't even believe how you live like this come to my church we'll buy you a brand new home and I heard a voice before you permissible it talked to me through those creatures they would come to me would offer me come and we'll fly you anywhere you want to go I don't have money for a Greyhound bus but I refused I refused to hear that angel come on church almost you can refuse to hear that Angels the angel that comes and tells you you're lost but yes don't hear him to the Cross you listen to what Michael is saying hey when you need him the most yeah you are struggling right now when Michael shall stand I'm telling you Michael is standing right now but he stands for his people that voice alone I refuse to hear that angel when I refuse God showed me the other angels I'm gonna say it again when I refuse that angel God opened his eyes and showed him another ring came to me I didn't know him but he came to our pastors oh come on come on you act like you don't know what I'm talking about and I remember he said that one day that he came to him in a dream you help me take this message even as many as the Lord or God shall call yeah and I end with this is I remember that day in El Paso in El Paso I don't know six seven years ago is a real enemy I remember when I was in that hotel room and it was like when that Dimension opened Panthers was like a curtain Cortina and when I saw that angel just stick out his head my it's real it don't matter whose son you are important matter what church you go it matters whose son you are don't get me wrong and what I'm saying it or else you're going to twist what I said it don't matter what church yes it does matter what important how I'm saying this I think the church is going to save you are the church all those things matter place it right what he's trying to get at look when he pulled that Kern over and I saw him he put his head down and that's all I could remember and all I could do put my arms up and say in the name of Jesus Jesus [Music] hmm boom and I could feel his presence still in the room my wife put her hand on me she knew what was going on and my heart a million miles an hour I said oh Lord if it wasn't for you there's none of us that would have a chance Church it wasn't for the grace of almighty God through the plan of Lucifer there was no Grace no expression of love but through the plan of God all these attributes began to pour out of here what he said what's the purpose of us living in this evil age says this for one reason we are not living in this age it's to prove to satanas that we are not like Eve come on church I'm going to say it again that's why we're here we're not like that Eve we have taken our free more and if today you hear his voice don't Harden your heart you stand to your feet disappointed [Applause] sorry I took a little bit long expensive I wanted to make sure I got it out yeah I want you just to think for a moment for billions of years they worship God but never in the capacity that you and I are worshiping him they know nothing of redemption those angels because of that yeah oh my God I am so in love with him thank you for your plan and though we struggle young we have hardships [Music] it's not easy no it's faster but at the end of the day it's all worth it because I live he says you live there's somebody here that says brother I want to make sure [Music] that my angel went to the right side of the Miguel I want to make sure brother today I can't go by chance no no no today you gotta be certain what's
