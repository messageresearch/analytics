name is Ry you may be seated he had a rough life he he wants uh says he wants to say a few words to the church is that okay all right God bless you I would just like to say that this is the most loving place I've ever been in my life you know I know you may not want me here by the way I look and the way I'm dressed but I believe God sent me here today I wasn't going to walk down this way but some guys I was with kicked me out of the car and I just I had a dream last night and it was about this world and the condition it's in and the word came to me and it said said respect has been lost nobody respects anybody anymore from the children to the leader of this country respect has been lost and I just would like to share a few things that I believe I know and first thing is you can never have respect unless first you have fear and I'm not talking about being afraid of anything God knows I'm not afraid of anything I sleep in ditches I'm talking about the fear of God when he comes into your heart and you realize that you never want to do anything to grieve the Holy Spirit and different people and if I could just say my testimony as a young man I was like you all I didn't want to be a bum what most would call homeless you know I had a father and a mother who loved me took care of me we had a nice house clothes on our back never in need of anything and I had two older brothers they never picked on me they took care of me and they proved that there was there was love and they they always took care of me through everything they never picked on me and my father was a doctor and I always wanted to be a doctor I went to school I had lots of friends I made great Straight A's and I went to high school went to college and I became a doctor a cardiologist and I met the of my life her name was Florida and I went through school and when I started to become a doctor I started to hang out with the wrong people I would go to work get out and I started hanging around with other people who made a lot of money and I'd go to have a a social drink started as just a sip of wine one sip turned into two sips then a glass then it just was bottles and it got to the point where I just lost control it came to the point where I gave up my right to choose if I was going to drink or not because I just had no choice that's all I could do well every day was a party at my house I stopped going to work my wife she left me my kids left all my so-called friends were nowhere to be found and I was all alone in California and it came to the point where I looked back and started to replay My Life as a child and i' vividly remember my mother teaching me not to drink not to smoke and as the Bible says defile my body and that's all I had ever done and instead of stopping right there I continued so much that I would do it just to drown out that voice of my mother and my father and I would just drink to numb all the feelings that I was feeling but I do believe that God is alive and the reason I know is because I see such loving people as you are in the midst of all this and I know you might think I'm here just for money but I'm putting that in your offering I believe I should give that back cuz I came for one purpose and that was to show that there still is people who respect and who love the Lord and you know Jesus became homeless so that a homeless man like me could find a way and that's what he's done and I would just like to share a little scripture with you it's found in Matthew I had to write it down I don't have a Bible 2535 and it says for I was hungered and you gave me meat Glory I was thirsty and you gave me drink amen I was a stranger and you took me in naked and you clothed me I was sick and you visited me I was in prison and you came unto me now if you know your Bible Jesus is talking to his disciples and as he says these words they begin to question him and they say Jesus when did we ever do that for you we didn't do such a thing and he gives them such an answer and he tells them in so much as you have done it unto the least of these brothers you have done it unto me amen and if I did not see this today in this church I don't know what it is and lastly I would like to leave you with Hebrews 13 2 be not forgetful to entertain strangers for there for thereby some have entertained angels unaware Glory God bless [Applause] you e hold on a second brother come back up here real quick go and play something a little bit there brother some some of you might not know who this man [Music] is might have looked like a told stranger well brother would would you go ahead and show us who who you really [Music] [Applause] are you never know when one day an angel might visit you amen and you will give an account to God for how you treat that angel am [Music] boys you are here you're moving in our midst and I wor you and I worship you and you are here you're mve moving in this place and I worship you I worship you and you are he you're

we're Christians and we should talk like Christians we should act like Christians we are the light in the dark and no matter what the trend is of the day we have a better Trend and that's to be fashioned as the word tells us as young children don't ever give in to the world fight with tooth and nail whatever you have to do don't fall into that trap it's all a trap of the enemy you can go to school you can get an education those are good things but always put God first and whatever you do amen God bless you [Applause] amen wow how many of you little kids enjoyed that yeah yeah can I tell you another secret though okay I want you to turn around real quick okay see do you see there's empty seats are they empty no no in each of those seats if you could just believe it with all your heart
