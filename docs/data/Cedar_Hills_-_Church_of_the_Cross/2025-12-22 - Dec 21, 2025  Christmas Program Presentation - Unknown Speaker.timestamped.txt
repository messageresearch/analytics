[12:08] Would
[12:16] you join me and sing it together now?
[12:31] &gt;&gt; [music]
[12:32] &gt;&gt; Oh, [singing]
[12:36] the measures [music]
[12:48] [singing]
[12:55] [music] for me.
[13:00] &gt;&gt; [music]
[13:09] [music]
[13:09] &gt;&gt; You can raise your hands if you like.
[13:18] [music and singing]
[13:24] [music]
[13:25] of grace.
[13:29] [singing and music]
[13:35] There are
[13:38] no [singing]
[13:40] contra. [music]
[13:50] [singing]
[13:55] [music]
[13:59] [music]
[14:01] Oh,
[14:05] the measure
[14:08] [singing and music]
[14:17] [singing]
[14:20] [music]
[14:23] is this for me.
[14:31] We're going to ask [music] you to stand
[14:32] together now.
[14:35] Stand in the presence of the Lord. We
[14:36] believe that he's here tonight.
[14:41] We believe that the Lord Jesus is here.
[14:45] And the reason he's here is because we
[14:46] are here.
[14:48] The Bible says, "If there's two or three
[14:50] congregated in my name,
[14:53] there I will be in the midst of them."
[14:56] So, we're confiding in the Lord tonight.
[14:59] We're going to pray and ask the Lord
[15:01] [music]
[15:03] &gt;&gt; to take this humble servant
[15:08] &gt;&gt; and this humble service
[15:11] &gt;&gt; and use it to magnify his name.
[15:14] &gt;&gt; For he is the King of Kings and Lord of
[15:16] Lords.
[15:18] &gt;&gt; Lord Jesus, we come before your throne
[15:20] [music]
[15:22] of grace and mercy tonight.
[15:25] with thankfulness in our heart
[15:28] because of what you have done for us.
[15:32] Lord, on our own we're nothing,
[15:35] &gt;&gt; but with you all things are possible.
[15:39] And we're grateful to be called your
[15:40] children tonight. [music]
[15:43] We know by the sacred scriptures
[15:47] that you were not born on the 25th of
[15:49] December,
[15:52] but we do know without a shadow of a
[15:54] doubt.
[15:56] That you were born
[15:58] and one day you were born in our hearts.
[16:02] And we thank you for that, Lord.
[16:05] That made us from old creatures to new
[16:07] creatures.
[16:10] Now, as we report for duty, Lord,
[16:13] we ask that you receive our worship
[16:16] and our praise and our thanksgiving back
[16:20] to you.
[16:21] In Jesus name we pray.
[16:24] &gt;&gt; Amen. You may be seated.
[16:27] We want to welcome you tonight
[16:30] to our Christmas program of 2025.
[16:35] It's going to be our our children's
[16:37] department
[16:39] and our young people's department.
[16:42] I believe you're going to have yourself
[16:44] a great time in the Lord.
[16:48] &gt;&gt; Don't be ashamed to clap your hands.
[16:56] [applause and music]
[16:58] Don't be afraid to say amen.
[17:01] Amen.
[17:01] &gt;&gt; Don't be afraid to say hallelujah.
[17:04] Praise be to God.
[17:07] &gt;&gt; We're thankful to the Lord tonight. So,
[17:09] welcome everybody.
[17:13] &gt;&gt; And most of all, welcome Lord Jesus
[17:15] Christ tonight.
[17:19] [applause and music]
[17:21] &gt;&gt; Amen. I'm going to ask you to all to
[17:22] stand
[17:24] as we worship just a little bit
[17:28] &gt;&gt; and we sing this song, Holy Forever.
[17:40] In a manger,
[17:42] the son of God arrived.
[17:45] The one who would be called Emmanuel,
[17:52] the promised one delivered
[17:55] unto a virgin bride,
[17:58] the one who would be called Emmanuel.
[18:03] Your name is the highest. Your name is
[18:07] the highest. Your name is the greatest.

[19:35] [music and singing] of heaven
[19:37] with holy roar proclaimed [music] the
[19:41] one who would be called Emmanuel.
[19:44] [music and singing]
[19:48] Our God is with [music] us now. And

[24:34] &gt;&gt; Who is this king [music] of glory?
[24:41] that pursues me with his love
[24:44] [singing and music]
[24:47] and haunts me with each [singing]
[24:51] [music]
[24:53] of his softly spoken words.
[25:00] my conscience, my reminder
[25:06] of forgiveness that I need. [music]
[25:13] Who is this king [music] of glory?
[25:18] Who offers it to me? [singing and music]
[25:24] His name is Jesus.
[25:32] Oh, precious Jesus,
[25:37] [music and singing] the Lord Almighty.
[25:41] He's the King of [music] my heart,

[29:32] First and foremost, God bless you to
[29:34] each and every one of you. I hope you
[29:36] have a wonderful play today. To all of
[29:38] our staff of Sunday school teachers and
[29:40] their helpers, God bless you for all
[29:42] your hard work and dedication. to the
[29:44] congregation. God bless you to each and
[29:47] every one of you. Have a very merry
[29:48] Christmas and we'll see you all when we
[29:50] get home.
[29:52] Hello children. Just want to say first
[29:54] and foremost, God bless you to each and
[29:56] every one of you.
[29:59] [applause]
[30:54] I just
[31:44] &gt;&gt; [snorts]
[31:45] &gt;&gt; Hello.
[31:46] Hello and welcome to the Cedar Hills
[31:49] Church of the Cross children's Christmas
[31:51] drama. We are all familiar with the
[31:53] nativity story, but have you ever
[31:56] wondered about the stars that led the
[31:58] three mages? And yes, you heard
[32:01] correctly. I said stars because there
[32:04] are three stars. Today we are going to
[32:06] get a little glimpse of what the stars
[32:08] may have seen. So deacons, pass out the
[32:10] popcorn and candy to the congregation as
[32:13] we go on this journey that took place
[32:15] over 2,000 years ago. Wait a minute.
[32:18] Cancel that deacons. There's no eating
[32:20] church. Anyways, we hope you enjoy our
[32:23] show.
[32:29] &gt;&gt; [applause]
[32:36] &gt;&gt; Is it ever going to be time yet? We've
[32:38] been waiting over 700 years ever since
[32:40] they prophesied.
[32:42] &gt;&gt; Is this thing even working? Maybe it
[32:44] needs to be charged. Apple is supposed
[32:46] to have a long battery life.
[32:50] &gt;&gt; Wake me up when Gabriel gets here.
[32:57] &gt;&gt; Guess what, everyone? It's time. Really?
[32:59] It's time.
[33:00] &gt;&gt; The son of the most high, Emanuel, is to
[33:02] be born.
[33:03] &gt;&gt; Yes, he'll be born very soon. As a
[33:05] matter of fact, I just finished talking
[33:07] to Mary, the young lady who was chosen
[33:09] to give birth to the Messiah.
[33:12] &gt;&gt; Okay, calm down. Calm down. You do know
[33:14] what you're all supposed to do, right?
[33:16] &gt;&gt; Are you kidding me? Of course, we know
[33:18] what to do.
[33:19] &gt;&gt; We've been practicing since before the
[33:20] foundation of the world.
[33:22] &gt;&gt; You've been looking over the banister
[33:23] all this time. Now, it's time to go into
[33:26] action. When the Messiah is born, you go
[33:28] to work shining bright for the three
[33:30] magi.
[33:31] &gt;&gt; All right, I got you. We won't let you
[33:33] down.
[33:34] &gt;&gt; Don't forget now, when the son of God is
[33:36] born in Bethlehem, that is your cue. It
[33:38] is very important that you leave the
[33:41] three magi.
[33:42] &gt;&gt; All right, I got you.
[34:28] teacher to give her.
[34:51] Hello. Okay, there we go. The magi's
[34:54] foot are for gold, frankincense, and mr
[34:57] to the son of god. God. The gold
[35:00] represented that he is the eternal king.
[35:03] Frankincense because he is a sweet
[35:05] smelling savor to God. Myrrh was given
[35:08] because it was a costly but bitter herb
[35:10] which represented his great supreme
[35:12] sacrifice. It was God, deity, and
[35:14] service to die.
[35:17] &gt;&gt; How much longer, Joseph? I don't think I
[35:19] could travel much further. The baby's
[35:21] coming soon.
[35:22] &gt;&gt; Hold on, Mary. We're almost there.
[35:24] &gt;&gt; As soon as they come to a corner, we
[35:27] attack.
[35:28] &gt;&gt; Wait.
[35:30] Everyone who passes this way is
[35:32] basically a sitting duck. There's no
[35:33] room for them to run.
[35:35] &gt;&gt; Uhoh.
[35:37] &gt;&gt; Remember, go for the jewels and any
[35:40] coins that you find. Don't waste time
[35:41] with anything else.
[35:44] &gt;&gt; Duh. It's not my first robbery.
[35:49] Look at the perfect target. A man and
[35:52] his pregnant wife. It's going to be like
[35:54] taking candy from a baby.
[35:57] &gt;&gt; Get ready. As soon as they come to a
[35:58] corner, we attack.
[36:06] Where did they go? They were right there
[36:07] a second ago. It's like they disappeared
[36:10] into thin air.
[36:12] &gt;&gt; How am I supposed to know? You were
[36:14] supposed to be watching.
[36:15] &gt;&gt; You were supposed to be watching. It's
[36:17] like there was a shield guarding them.
[36:20] &gt;&gt; Wait, look. What are those?
[36:23] &gt;&gt; Oh no. Lion tracks. Let's get out of
[36:25] here.
[36:33] What now? First robbers. Now look,
[36:36] there's lions.
[36:37] &gt;&gt; Don't worry. The angel of the Lord is in
[36:39] control of the situation. Look,
[36:44] &gt;&gt; girl.
[36:51] [laughter]
[36:54] &gt;&gt; I wonder why God used
[36:58] &gt;&gt; [applause]
[37:00] &gt;&gt; I wonder why God used such a small
[37:02] animal like a squirrel. It's almost like
[37:05] it would have an important part to play
[37:06] in the future. Like a prophet would need
[37:09] one ladder or something.
[37:12] We should have known that God had
[37:13] everything under control the whole time.
[37:16] After all, the angel of the Lord in
[37:18] campus run about those that fear him and
[37:21] deliverth him.
[37:23] The Roman Emperor Caesar Augustus made a
[37:26] decree that all people were required to
[37:28] travel to the place they were born to
[37:31] register to be counted. When they
[37:33] arrived, Joseph and Mary went from in to
[37:35] inn looking for a place to rest.
[37:42] &gt;&gt; Yes. How can I help you?
[37:44] &gt;&gt; I need a room, please. My wife is about
[37:45] to have a baby, and every in we stop at
[37:48] is full.
[37:48] &gt;&gt; Sarah, where are you?
[37:51] I'm right in here. There are
[37:58] right in here. Are you sure we don't
[38:00] have any more rooms available?
[38:03] &gt;&gt; Are you kidding me? We've got to pack
[38:05] in. We don't even have any more air
[38:08] mattresses available. You even gave away
[38:11] my room. Looks like I'm sleeping in the
[38:13] broom closet this weekend.
[38:17] Sheesh. Someone's cranky. So many people
[38:20] have come because of the senses. I'm
[38:23] sorry, but my inn is full also. But
[38:26] I do have Never mind.
[38:29] &gt;&gt; Please tell us we really need a place to
[38:31] stay.
[38:31] &gt;&gt; I do have a stable. I warn you, it's
[38:34] nothing fancy. You'll have to share with
[38:36] my animals. You're welcome to use it,
[38:38] though.
[38:38] &gt;&gt; Thank you for the offer. We'll keep
[38:39] looking for a room.
[38:41] &gt;&gt; Please, Joseph, I need to rest now. The
[38:43] baby's coming soon.
[38:44] &gt;&gt; Mary, how can the kings of kings be born
[38:46] in a stable? You should be born in a
[38:48] palace, but at the very least a room in
[38:50] an inn.
[38:50] &gt;&gt; God's ways are higher than us. Stay we
[38:52] find there isn't much time left.
[38:54] &gt;&gt; I need some help in here. There are 20
[38:57] people waiting for cleaning sheets and I
[39:00] haven't started on dinner yet.
[39:05] &gt;&gt; I'm coming. Goodness, it's so hard to
[39:07] find good help these days. Well, the
[39:10] staples right down the road if you
[39:12] choose to use it. At least it'll be
[39:14] warmer than the streets. I'll even throw
[39:16] a couple warm meals later if you choose
[39:18] to stay. Best luck to both of you.
[39:40] to go.
[40:09] Excuse
[40:10] me.
[40:41] &gt;&gt; [screaming]
[40:43] &gt;&gt; Fear not. We bring good news. Your
[40:45] savior is born in the city of David who
[40:47] is Christ the Lord.
[40:48] &gt;&gt; You'll find him wrapped in swaddling
[40:49] cloths laying in a manger.
[40:55] From
[41:16] [music]
[41:22] heaven's known to a stable floor.
[41:28] The son of God to a virgin [music]
[41:32] born.
[41:35] This tiny child [singing and music]
[41:37] brings hope to all.
[41:42] Behold [singing]
[41:43] the king has
[41:48] the king [singing] as
[41:50] a god of the world. He gave his [music]
[41:55] only

[42:03] angels to the sky
[42:06] with
[42:08] the [singing] world [music]
[42:14] [music]
[42:14] [singing]
[42:20] dance and saw our king.
[42:25] Shepherds heal and the angels sing
[42:30] [music]
[42:31] for David
[42:34] has entered.
[42:38] Hey,

[42:48] [music]
[42:50] [singing]
[42:58] [music]
[42:59] heat.
[43:04] [music]
[43:06] Hey. Oh my [music]
[43:09] [singing] god
[43:14] [singing and music]
[43:15] upon the earth
[43:20] [music] united [singing] by our savior's
[43:23] day.
[43:26] My father
[43:29] [music]
[43:36] [music]
[43:39] has
[43:43] &gt;&gt; [music]
[43:44] [singing]
[43:44] &gt;&gt; is always
[43:51] [music]
[43:54] [singing] the
[43:56] Precision for the world.
[44:01] Behold [music]
[44:02] the king [singing]
[44:04] of
[44:06] [music]
[44:12] [applause]
[44:19] &gt;&gt; Did you all see what I saw?
[44:21] &gt;&gt; Yes. It was a miracle.
[44:23] &gt;&gt; Yes, it was a miracle.
[44:26] Let's go see the savior.
[44:34] We said watching boring. Oh yeah.
[44:52] See, I told you it was about to get
[44:55] good. This is what we've been waiting
[44:57] for.
[44:58] &gt;&gt; Not only are we guiding, but we're
[45:00] witnessing.
[45:02] &gt;&gt; Meanwhile, hundreds of miles away, the
[45:05] magi are on their journey following
[45:08] their stars to see Jesus. These magi
[45:11] were king of the orient
[45:14] who studied the stars. Each had noticed
[45:17] in their country that one was brighter
[45:19] and different than all the others.
[45:22] Each of the magi began following that
[45:24] star that they saw until those three
[45:27] stars merged into one star over
[45:29] Jerusalem when Jesus was born. The three
[45:32] wise men met when those
[45:35] traveling together with the same
[45:36] purpose, finding he that was born king
[45:39] of the Jews.
[46:03] Look at this ancient Hebrew writing by
[46:05] Balum,
[46:06] &gt;&gt; one of the prophets. It says here, "They
[46:07] shall rise a star to Jacob."
[46:10] &gt;&gt; And we've been studying this star for
[46:11] months now, and we know it defies all
[46:14] the laws of the solar system.
[46:16] This is confirmation we have been
[46:18] looking for. The bright star reflects a
[46:20] greater light, a heavenly being.
[46:46] Look, the star moved again.
[46:50] &gt;&gt; Wow, I can't believe it. In all of my
[46:52] years of studying the stars, I have
[46:54] never seen anything like this.
[46:56] &gt;&gt; Well, it did move after all. Let's go to
[47:02] &gt;&gt; Did you just hear those guys? They
[47:04] probably just saw a star starlink
[47:06] satellite
[47:07] &gt;&gt; or a fallen star
[47:08] &gt;&gt; or an airplane.
[47:09] &gt;&gt; What? An airplane? What's that?
[47:11] &gt;&gt; I don't know. I just made it up.
[47:13] [laughter]
[47:17] &gt;&gt; Well, it did move after all. Let's go to
[47:19] Jerusalem. It is the religious capital
[47:21] of the world after all.
[47:23] &gt;&gt; You're right. I bet everyone in the city
[47:25] is talking about the king of the Jews.
[47:27] News this big has to be going viral over
[47:29] there.
[47:31] &gt;&gt; Well, let's go. If let's go to
[47:33] Jerusalem. We can get there in about a
[47:35] few nights.
[48:02] Hello. Have you heard about the child
[48:04] that spurn the king of the Jews?
[48:06] &gt;&gt; King of the Jews? A child? What are you
[48:08] talking about?
[48:11] You had better be careful. This is this
[48:13] is King's Herod's territory. You must be
[48:15] troublemakers.
[48:16] &gt;&gt; We don't want any trouble. We just want
[48:18] to pay homage to the King of Kings.
[48:20] &gt;&gt; Yep. They're looking for trouble. Don't
[48:22] you know King Herod? Spies are
[48:24] everywhere. Why would you want to put
[48:27] yourselves in danger?
[48:30] &gt;&gt; Sorry, but even talking about other
[48:32] kings is chasing against King's Herods.
[48:34] We better get out of here now.
[48:37] &gt;&gt; Exactly what I was thinking. If you were
[48:39] smart, you would turn back and go home.
[48:43] The golden
[49:28] Through mountains and valleys
[49:31] they followed the star,
[49:36] the star of most [music] rad
[49:39] and night.
[49:42] All right, you with me? The wise men
[49:46] rejoiced
[49:48] with all of their hearts
[49:52] to behold. Come on, Richie. Such a
[49:55] beautiful [music]
[49:56] sign. I don't think you heard me
[49:58] tonight. But through mountains and
[50:01] [music] valleys they followed the star.
[50:06] [music]
[50:07] The star of most radiant light.
[50:13] The wise men rejoice
[50:16] WITH ALL OF THEIR HEART TO BEHOLD
[50:21] SUCH A BEAUTIFUL.
[50:27] WHEN THEY SAW THE STAR, THEY rejoiced
[50:30] [music] with rejoice.
[50:32] WHEN THEY SAW THE STAR, THEY rejoice
[50:36] with great [music] joy. When they saw
[50:39] the star, they rejoice with great joy.
[50:42] They rejoice with [music]
[50:45] great joy.
[50:48] When they saw they rejoice with rejoice.
[50:52] [music]
[50:53] When they saw
[50:58] Oh, when they s [music]
[51:01] they rejoice with rejoice. They rejoice
[51:05] with extreme rejoice.
[51:09] I have SEEN THE STAR. I REJOICE WITH
[51:13] REJOICE. [music]
[51:14] I HAVE SEEN THE STAR. I REJOICE WITH
[51:18] GREAT JOY. [music] I have seen the star.
[51:22] I rejoice with great joy. I with [music]
[51:26] exceeding great joy.
[51:31] They rejoice [music]
[51:33] with exceeding great joy.
[51:47] We've been traveling so long to find
[51:49] you, my lord. We followed a star and it
[51:51] led us to you.
[51:57] &gt;&gt; Wow. I can't believe it. Wait, no.
[52:03] &gt;&gt; Wait, hold up.
[52:07] We travel from seven lands not knowing
[52:09] we be following the same store that
[52:12] would lead us to the family following
[52:14] Messiah. We've each brought him gifts.
[52:18] &gt;&gt; I have brought him the finest and purest
[52:21] gold for he is the king of heaven and
[52:22] earth and it represents his deity.
[52:26] &gt;&gt; I bring him frankincense because he
[52:28] serves a sermon. He smells sweet to God
[52:31] and he will be in a service to his
[52:33] people.
[52:36] My gift is my because he will pay a
[52:39] great sacrifice.
[52:41] Now,
[52:43] [applause]
[52:48] now I know they come sent from God.
[52:50] Remember the dream I had, Mary? And the
[52:52] angel Gabriel said that Jesus would save
[52:54] all all his pe all his people from their
[52:57] sins.
[52:58] &gt;&gt; Yes, I remember. You told me.
[53:02] &gt;&gt; Look at him just to believe. He is the
[53:03] promised Messiah. Look at him play with
[53:05] his blocks just like an ordinary boy.
[53:08] &gt;&gt; It is an amazing sight to see. We must
[53:10] return to our homelands now. You see, we
[53:13] have been traveling here for 2 years.
[53:16] &gt;&gt; Really? Well, we thank you for your
[53:18] gifts. May God be with you as you travel
[53:20] home. Thank you for your obedience and
[53:22] following the stars.
[53:47] After the wise men presented Jesus with
[53:50] their gifts and they and as they
[53:52] prepared to leave, they were warned in a
[53:54] dream not to pass by King Herod's
[53:57] kingdom as they journeyied home.
[54:05] &gt;&gt; You know, I don't trust King Herod. I
[54:08] even had a dream last night to not pass
[54:09] through Judea. King Herod is a bad man,
[54:12] and I think he will not hesitate to kill
[54:14] anyone that feels is a threat to his
[54:15] throne.
[54:16] &gt;&gt; Yes, I had the same dream. Let's go home
[54:19] another way and avoid King Herod. We
[54:21] must not give any information about
[54:23] Jesus.
[54:43] So the wise men split up and went their
[54:45] separate ways, each to his own country,
[54:48] spreading the word that the prophecies
[54:50] of the Messiah had been fulfilled.
[54:57] Now, that was an amazing story worth
[55:00] waiting for, right?
[55:02] &gt;&gt; I told
[55:04] &gt;&gt; I told you it'd be. You've lived up to
[55:06] your word and led the wise men straight
[55:08] to Jesus.
[55:09] &gt;&gt; I told you I would. At times, I wasn't
[55:11] sure how the story would play out, but
[55:13] God had planned it all so perfectly.
[55:16] Keep looking over the banister and see
[55:18] how amazing Jesus's life would be. what
[55:20] I wouldn't give to go down to earth and
[55:22] be a follower of Jesus.
[55:23] &gt;&gt; I can't wait. I get a front row seat.
[55:26] How could anyone disbelieve the son of
[55:28] God?
[55:29] &gt;&gt; We will see who will decide to follow
[55:30] Jesus. But just just wait. This is just
[55:34] the beginning. Just wait until he begins
[55:36] to heal the sick, save the lost, and
[55:38] redeem his people. What did you call it
[55:40] again a couple years ago? Ah, yes. This
[55:42] is the greatest story ever told.
[55:47] &gt;&gt; [applause]
[55:50] [cheering]
[55:56] &gt;&gt; Careful.
[56:16] Please [music] not. [singing]

[58:02] and a happy new year.
[58:05] [applause and cheering]
[58:06] &gt;&gt; Well done.
[58:12] &gt;&gt; I could get that online.
[58:46] Amen. And let's give another one to the
[58:47] children this evening. [applause]
[58:51] Amen.
[58:53] What an awesome job they did.
[58:56] &gt;&gt; Amen. Would you all please stand?
[59:00] Amen. Let's sing that song. What a
[59:01] beautiful name it is. The name of Jesus.
[59:05] Amen.
[59:10] Just lift your hands to the King of
[59:12] Kings.
[59:20] What a beautiful [singing] name it is.
[59:23] The name of Jesus.
[59:30] You were the word [singing] at the
[59:32] beginning, [music]
[59:35] one with God the Lord most [singing]
[59:39] high.

[59:49] now [music] revealed in you [singing]

[1:00:04] Christ my king.
[1:00:08] What [music and singing] a beautiful
[1:00:09] name it is.
[1:00:12] Nothing compares to this. What a
[1:00:15] beautiful [music and singing] name it
[1:00:16] is. The name of Jesus.
[1:00:23] [music]
[1:00:24] You didn't want heaven without us.
[1:00:29] So Jesus, [singing] you brought heaven
[1:00:33] down.
[1:00:35] [singing and music] Oh my sin was great.
[1:00:39] Your love is greater.
[1:00:42] And [music and singing] what could
[1:00:43] separate
[1:00:46] us now? What a [music and singing]
[1:00:48] beautiful name it is. What a beautiful
[1:00:52] name it is. [singing]
[1:00:54] The name of Jesus [music] Christ my
[1:00:59] king.
[1:01:01] What a beautiful name it is. [singing]
[1:01:04] Nothing [music] compares to this. What a
[1:01:08] beautiful name it is. The name of
[1:01:12] [music] Jesus
[1:01:14] and death could not hold you. The
[1:01:17] [music] veil [singing] to go before you.
[1:01:20] You silence the b of sin and grave.
[1:01:27] The [music and singing] heavens are
[1:01:28] roaring
[1:01:30] the praise of your glory.
[1:01:34] For you are raised to life
[1:01:37] [music and singing]
[1:01:38] again.
[1:01:40] And you have no rival [music] and you
[1:01:44] have no [singing] equal.
[1:01:46] Now and forever,
[1:01:49] [music] God, you [singing] reign.
[1:01:52] And yours is the kingom.

[1:02:03] name.

[1:03:12] said the [singing] night went to the
[1:03:15] little [music] lamb.
[1:03:19] Do you see what I see?
[1:03:24] [singing]
[1:03:26] Way up [music] in the sky. Little lamb.
[1:03:32] Do you [singing] see what I see?
[1:03:38] As far as I [singing] dancing in the
[1:03:43] night with [music] a tail as big as a K.
[1:03:51] With a tail [singing] as [music] big as
[1:03:54] a K.
[1:04:00] In the little lamb [singing]
[1:04:02] to the shepher. [music]
[1:04:07] Do you [singing] hear what I hear
[1:04:14] ringing [music]
[1:04:14] through the sky? Shepher. [singing]
[1:04:19] [music] Do you hear what I
[1:04:27] love? Heat. Heat. [music and singing]
[1:04:39] As big [music] as the sea.
[1:04:47] The shepherd [music and singing] falls
[1:04:49] to the mighty king.
[1:04:53] Oh, do you [singing and music] know what
[1:04:55] I know?
[1:04:59] [music]
[1:05:00] In your palace [singing]
[1:05:02] my dec.
[1:05:06] [music] You [singing] know what I
[1:05:16] [music]
[1:05:18] bring in [singing] silver and gold
[1:05:24] [music]
[1:05:26] [singing]
[1:05:27] and gold?
[1:05:33] is [music and singing] the king to the
[1:05:35] people everywhere.
[1:05:40] [music] Listen to what I say.
[1:05:46] Pray for [music and singing] peace
[1:05:48] people everywhere.
[1:05:52] Listen to [singing] what I say
[1:05:57] all the time.
[1:06:00] [music]
[1:06:01] Even in the night he will bring us
[1:06:06] goodness [music]
[1:06:07] [singing] and
[1:06:10] he will bring [music] us goodness.
[1:06:14] [singing]
[1:06:16] Oh,
[1:06:18] a child
[1:06:20] sleeping in the [music] night. [singing]
[1:06:22] He will bring us goodness and light.
[1:06:29] He will bring [music and singing] us
[1:06:31] goodness and life.
[1:06:35] Praise the name of the [music] Lord.
[1:06:37] [applause]
[1:06:38] Can you give the Lord Jesus a mighty
[1:06:40] hand? Clap of praise. And you may be
[1:06:43] seated. [music]
[1:07:03] &gt;&gt; [crying]
[1:07:23] &gt;&gt; an author. once said and it holds with
[1:07:26] truth that life must be understood
[1:07:29] backwards.
[1:07:31] What an impact to see the life of Christ
[1:07:34] from the cross back to the manger. We
[1:07:37] behold only the end of the beginning. We
[1:07:41] behold the sacrifice given led up from
[1:07:45] miraculous events placed perfectly in
[1:07:48] his life. Eternal life in every step.
[1:07:52] Every person was impacted by his
[1:07:54] presence. From the Roman soldiers at the
[1:07:58] cross to his name being spoken which
[1:08:01] brought a dead [music] baby to life. Who
[1:08:04] is this? Our creator, the greatest gift
[1:08:08] given to humankind.
[1:08:11] This is Jesus.
[1:08:53] Behold. Okay.
[1:08:56] Behold a story more than words, for it's
[1:09:00] written within.
[1:09:02] A story of where we're going and also
[1:09:05] where [music] we've been. One that
[1:09:07] beckons its listeners to come up a bit
[1:09:10] higher. A journey where impossibilities
[1:09:13] form and transpire.
[1:09:16] Impossibilities to the carnal mind which
[1:09:18] deem it non-factual.
[1:09:20] But the spirit proclaims its truth for
[1:09:23] those supernatural.
[1:09:26] How else can you explain [music] a lion
[1:09:27] that can become a lamb? Or why God would
[1:09:30] choose a little town like that of
[1:09:32] Bethlehem?
[1:09:34] Can the past be our future or the future
[1:09:37] our past? Could the last become first
[1:09:40] and the first become last? How can a man
[1:09:43] die [music]
[1:09:44] and yet live again? Or a man be so
[1:09:47] innocent yet covered in sin? [music]
[1:09:51] How can a powerful king also be called
[1:09:54] lowly? or a night [music] followed by a
[1:09:56] baby massacre also be holy? Can a baby
[1:10:00] hold the promise to save the whole
[1:10:02] earth? Or is it more likely for a
[1:10:05] [music] virgin to give birth? So if it's
[1:10:08] all impossible, why do we know it to be
[1:10:11] true? Because this story took place

[1:36:27] Lord.
[1:36:29] that you would bless them, Lord. That
[1:36:32] you would show yourself to them.
[1:36:35] What else can we do but give our lives
[1:36:37] to you, Lord?
[1:36:40] You gave our your life so that we could
[1:36:43] live.
[1:36:45] And now, Lord, we give our life back to
[1:36:47] you, Lord.
[1:36:49] Do with us as you would, Lord.
[1:36:52] Once again, I pray a blessing Lord
[1:36:55] on all the children, young people or the
[1:36:59] helpers.

[1:37:03] that they've gone through and done
[1:37:06] to be a blessing to your people here and
