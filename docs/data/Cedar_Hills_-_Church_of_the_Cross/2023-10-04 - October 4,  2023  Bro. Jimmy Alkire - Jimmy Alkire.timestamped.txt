[43:12] God Lord
[43:15] Jesus it's such an honor to be here
[43:18] tonight
[43:22] Lord to speak to the redeemed Lord
[43:28] to speak to those that you purchased
[43:31] with your own
[43:35] blood how would we ever
[43:40] defraud that redeemed product
[43:45] Lord we stand here to be a blessing to
[43:48] your children
[43:52] Lord realizing that we are just human
[43:55] flesh
[43:58] so here in the pulpit and in the
[44:03] audience we surrender to you Lord
[44:07] Jesus speak to us this
[44:11] night we ask it all in the precious name
[44:13] of our Lord and Savior Jesus
[44:18] Christ amen and amen amen as you're
[44:21] standing let's turn in our
[44:25] Bibles
[44:27] read to James chapter
[44:33] 1 and we're going to read verses 12
[44:36] through
[44:40] 19 and I want you all to think
[44:45] tonight so at first you might think well
[44:48] what are you talking
[44:51] about you follow
[44:54] along and if you feel led to take
[45:00] notes go home and study the
[45:04] word this is not just a Wednesday and
[45:07] Sunday
[45:11] matter is that every day with
[45:15] Jesus is sweeter than the day
[45:19] before the title of our message tonight
[45:21] is what are the colors of the master
[45:30] Diamond our
[45:33] subtitle the mystery of
[45:37] us there's a mystery about
[45:40] us and it's not way up
[45:44] here so
[45:46] simple that if we don't watch
[45:50] out it'll go right over our heads and we
[45:52] will'll never see
[45:54] it amen as we read the scripture
[45:58] now blessed is the man that endureth
[46:01] Temptation for when he is tried he shall
[46:03] receive the Crown of Life which the Lord
[46:06] has promised to him them that love
[46:19] him and let no man say when he is
[46:22] tempted I am tempted of God for God
[46:25] cannot be tempted with evil neither
[46:28] tempteth he any
[46:38] man but every man is tempted when he is
[46:42] drawn away of his own
[46:52] lust is enticed amen what is this lust
[46:57] that it's talking about
[47:01] here most of the time we think
[47:06] about adultery or
[47:13] drinking just doing bad
[47:17] things but we're going to find out that
[47:19] this temptation that it's talking
[47:23] about oh it can get to those things if
[47:25] we don't surrender to the
[47:30] Lord but it's not really talking about
[47:33] that kind of
[47:37] lust verse
[47:39] 15 then when lust have conceived it
[47:42] bringeth forth sin which is
[47:52] unbelief it bringeth forth sin which is
[47:55] unbelief and sin when it is finished
[47:58] bringeth forth
[48:05] death amen let us
[48:08] pray Lord we just thank you for your
[48:10] word
[48:12] Lord we just thank you for this
[48:14] privilege to speak to your
[48:18] children in the name of the Lord Jesus
[48:21] Christ amen you may be seated
[48:24] am
[48:26] just keep
[48:29] reading do not
[48:33] error other words don't make a
[48:37] mistake my beloved
[48:41] Brethren watch
[48:43] this every good
[48:48] gift and every perfect
[48:52] gift notice good gifts
[49:00] and perfect
[49:02] gifts you know you are partaking of the
[49:05] good gifts right
[49:09] now and that's not talking about
[49:12] anything
[49:14] spiritual that's talking about a normal
[49:18] life you're healthy enough to go to
[49:23] school healthy enough to come to
[49:27] Church you have wonderful
[49:30] parents you have good
[49:33] friends you have good food you have a
[49:36] roof over your
[49:38] head those are good
[49:41] gifts how many are thankful for what you
[49:45] have but now perfect
[49:49] gifts the those come from
[49:54] above amen
[49:56] and cometh down from the Father of
[50:03] Lights we're going to get into what
[50:05] these lights
[50:08] are how many would like to know what the
[50:11] lights of the master
[50:18] Diamond no yeah yeah see see yeah
[50:24] see yeah you notice I didn't say no
[50:27] again
[50:29] no with whom is no variableness neither
[50:33] shadow of
[50:38] turning God's not going to change his
[50:41] mind he's not going to be one way one
[50:44] day and another way the next
[50:48] day he's not going to treat you any
[50:50] different than he treats any of his
[50:53] other
[50:54] children
[50:59] sometimes we think well this brother
[51:00] seems to be our sister gets treated
[51:02] better than the
[51:06] others that is not
[51:08] true it just depends on how much of God
[51:12] you
[51:14] want is how much is going to be seen in
[51:17] your
[51:20] life of the goodness of
[51:23] God Amen amen of his own will begat he
[51:29] us with the word of
[51:34] truth that we should be a kind of first
[51:37] fruit of his
[51:41] creatures other words the first of his
[51:45] creatures that he
[51:48] created or the first
[51:51] ones we are of those
[51:54] creatures why did he think so much about
[51:58] us what does the word creatures mean
[52:00] here in the
[52:03] Greek it talks about the very early de
[52:06] development of the creation of
[52:13] God that he is creating in
[52:17] you that many times that you don't or I
[52:20] don't
[52:23] understand amen amen now notice it says
[52:27] of his it's talking about
[52:31] Temptation in the first few
[52:34] verses and then it talks about
[52:38] lust and Temptation and
[52:41] sin and then all of a sudden out of the
[52:43] blue he talks about
[52:47] gifts it's kind of kind of seems like
[52:49] there's something missing
[52:51] there even though there
[52:54] isn't and then he goes from there to the
[52:57] word of
[52:59] truth that has been begotten in
[53:03] us now that word
[53:06] begotten uses
[53:10] begat is not the new
[53:14] birth you notice in Spanish it
[53:21] said but when the word is begotten in
[53:24] your soul
[53:28] it's conceived in the spiritual womb of
[53:31] your
[53:34] mind oh yeah it's going to be
[53:37] born yeah amen it'll be born
[53:42] again but this
[53:45] temptation that it's talking
[53:48] about is when anything comes against
[53:52] that
[53:54] word
[53:56] that you have been begotten
[54:00] of that's the Temptation it's talking
[54:02] about
[54:04] here but then he says all these good
[54:09] gifts and these perfect
[54:12] gifts that coming down from the
[54:16] father oh my
[54:18] goodness he sees our
[54:21] condition he knows exactly what we need
[54:26] and even though we may we may be led
[54:28] astray by our own desires at
[54:33] times every good
[54:37] gift and perfect
[54:40] gift
[54:42] cometh continues to come
[54:46] down from the father of
[54:49] lights aren't you so happy for
[54:52] that you I was following up an
[54:56] inspiration that I spoke a little bit in
[54:58] Norway and in
[55:04] Poland that's why I put the subtitle of
[55:07] the mystery of
[55:10] us there's something about
[55:14] us that we don't yet
[55:18] understand but he's revealing it to
[55:23] us amen through the the word that we
[55:26] have been begotten
[55:30] of are you with me so far now if you
[55:34] study at home you'll really get
[55:39] itay and you
[55:42] meditate day and night in the
[55:45] word and you you're going to get some
[55:48] stuff that'll it'll you'll never be the
[55:51] same
[55:53] again now I would like to go to our
[55:56] first
[56:00] quote and before we do I want to read
[56:03] what the prophet said about a
[56:09] mystery and he says it in the message
[56:12] sir is this the
[56:17] end I'm going to read this quote here
[56:19] but I want to refer to this because he's
[56:20] talking about what a mystery
[56:23] is
[56:26] how many want the mystery of who you are
[56:28] to be
[56:31] revealed who you are in
[56:35] yourself no no in him oh that that's the
[56:40] important
[56:41] thing but he says in this
[56:45] message that a mystery is a
[56:49] scripture that is previously
[56:53] hidden truth
[56:55] that is now divinely
[57:00] revealed but which
[57:03] is a supernatural element
[57:10] remains even though this mystery has
[57:14] been
[57:16] revealed and for you that are new in the
[57:20] message Mark it down in your notes
[57:22] Revelation 107
[57:26] in the days of the voice of the seventh
[57:29] Earthly
[57:34] messenger why do I say it that way
[57:37] because that's what the word there angel
[57:40] means from the
[57:44] Greek when he shall begin to
[57:49] sound the mystery of
[57:53] God should be
[57:56] finished amen and we're not going to
[57:58] really get into
[58:00] that but to make it sweet and
[58:03] short are you a part of the
[58:07] mystery of
[58:09] God what part of the mystery are
[58:15] you so you
[58:18] ready oh my now as we read this and then
[58:22] we're going to go afterwards to First
[58:24] Corinthians 12 but let us read
[58:28] this it wasn't that God don't deal with
[58:32] a
[58:33] person a
[58:40] group I want you to get
[58:43] that we're a
[58:45] group but when he deals with you he's
[58:47] not always dealing with me the same
[58:52] way God don't deal with you as as an
[58:57] organization he deals with you as an
[59:02] individual an
[59:05] individual individually we are baptized
[59:08] with the Holy
[59:12] Ghost in other words I can't give you
[59:14] the Holy
[59:17] Ghost the baptism you need you've got to
[59:20] receive
[59:22] it he's going to give it to you
[59:27] individually but watch what happens
[59:29] after he baptizes you with the Holy
[59:35] Ghost the first
[59:38] time and I'm saying it that way on
[59:43] purpose we can go
[59:47] justification or
[59:49] repented I turned my back on the
[59:52] world I told the devil I want nothing to
[59:55] do with him no
[59:57] more God forgave me of my
[1:00:00] sins I was baptized in his
[1:00:03] name he has cleansed me or he looks at
[1:00:06] me as if I never did
[1:00:09] it oh now then he Sanctified
[1:00:14] me justification let's say it together
[1:00:17] we know this heart
[1:00:19] right together
[1:00:23] justification
[1:00:26] sanctification baptism of the Holy
[1:00:29] Ghost and the majority of what you'll
[1:00:32] hear today
[1:00:34] is that once you get to the point where
[1:00:37] you begin to receive the baptism of the
[1:00:40] Holy
[1:00:44] Ghost the majority will
[1:00:48] say you're sealed until the day of your
[1:00:53] Redemption
[1:00:55] but it ain't that
[1:00:57] way I know that that's that's a rough
[1:01:00] one right there that's a delicate
[1:01:03] one he is beginning to examine your box
[1:01:07] car as we heard on
[1:01:14] Sunday you're born
[1:01:17] again you're a baby do you that are new
[1:01:23] spiritually you can say Pap papa papa
[1:01:27] papa cuz you're a
[1:01:29] baby well a baby doesn't even know how
[1:01:31] to crawl it
[1:01:33] first and Jesus is not coming for a
[1:01:38] baby he's coming for a fully buture
[1:01:42] bride oh yeah that that baby's
[1:01:45] born oh that baby could even speak in
[1:01:49] tongues that's right a language that you
[1:01:51] don't
[1:01:53] understand you even know what his name
[1:01:56] is maybe your your blood blows in his
[1:01:59] veins if he's your family
[1:02:02] member but he's not yet in the position
[1:02:06] to be sealed for the
[1:02:11] Rapture amen amen amen so that that let
[1:02:16] that settle a little
[1:02:18] bit in a while we'll see how it all
[1:02:20] connects
[1:02:22] together now collectively we are
[1:02:25] baptized into the
[1:02:28] body when we are baptized with the Holy
[1:02:33] Ghost Brother David gave me this quote
[1:02:35] on
[1:02:39] Sunday you're baptized
[1:02:43] individually but
[1:02:45] then we're baptized collectively into
[1:02:49] the
[1:02:51] body in other words
[1:02:55] you received it as an
[1:02:57] individual but you don't function as an
[1:03:02] individual that's why it says
[1:03:06] collectively amen are you following
[1:03:09] it now notice before we go into that you
[1:03:13] you follow me so
[1:03:15] far individually each one is baptized
[1:03:18] with the Holy
[1:03:21] Ghost God dealing with each one
[1:03:26] that was his
[1:03:29] purpose scatter them across the
[1:03:33] Earth so he could deal individually with
[1:03:39] them let's go to the next
[1:03:42] paragraph amen or maybe I didn't give it
[1:03:44] to
[1:03:49] you think I
[1:03:51] did okay here it is but instead instead
[1:03:54] of
[1:03:55] that what happened now notice what he
[1:03:59] says
[1:04:01] first why he wanted to baptize them
[1:04:06] individually and to make them function
[1:04:08] as a
[1:04:10] body in the beginning that didn't
[1:04:14] happen but instead of that what
[1:04:18] happened God had to separate kain's
[1:04:21] people from Seth's people
[1:04:27] and he sent Cain
[1:04:29] away he separated him so he could deal
[1:04:33] with his
[1:04:36] church amen we're going to see how what
[1:04:39] this means to
[1:04:41] us what what what is this separation
[1:04:44] talking about right
[1:04:46] now separating one generation from the
[1:04:51] other or one brother or sister from from
[1:04:54] the
[1:04:56] other no because both Generations
[1:04:59] afterwards
[1:05:03] mixed but what has to be
[1:05:07] separated is the part of the evil can
[1:05:11] that's in your
[1:05:18] flesh oh brother I'm a Son of God oh
[1:05:21] yeah I believe
[1:05:22] it I'm God
[1:05:25] Amen you mean to tell me this stinking
[1:05:28] rotten
[1:05:30] thing is going to live
[1:05:34] eternally I've heard people say oh oh
[1:05:36] man I'm already
[1:05:40] perfect already have rapturing
[1:05:42] faith and I would asked what brother
[1:05:45] Tommy
[1:05:47] asked what in the world are you doing
[1:05:53] here you should have already been
[1:05:56] gone amen amen watch Cain was
[1:06:02] separated now watch God separated Eve's
[1:06:06] evil
[1:06:10] can from Adam's holy
[1:06:16] Seth wow we'll leave it
[1:06:20] there keep reading there we're going to
[1:06:22] get into something else
[1:06:26] amen praise the Living
[1:06:29] God so
[1:06:31] notice let's go back and talk about the
[1:06:34] supernatural element now we're going to
[1:06:36] connect this to see what these lights
[1:06:42] are of the master
[1:06:46] Diamond amen amen are you
[1:06:51] happy notice there remains a
[1:06:54] supernatural
[1:06:58] element where is
[1:07:03] it what does that element
[1:07:06] do amen
[1:07:09] amen is it super to
[1:07:14] God no no because that's just the way he
[1:07:18] is all the
[1:07:22] time well then how can it be
[1:07:26] Supernatural let's say it
[1:07:29] together he's the super super and we're
[1:07:33] the
[1:07:36] natural amen that's what makes it
[1:07:41] Supernatural it's not Supernatural to
[1:07:44] him because it's his very nature of what
[1:07:47] he
[1:07:49] is what motivates
[1:07:51] him that's what makes him act
[1:07:55] what makes him love you and
[1:07:58] me his very divine
[1:08:01] nature of his Divine
[1:08:04] love amen amen
[1:08:12] Supernatural so without
[1:08:15] you he cannot be made
[1:08:20] manifest as
[1:08:22] super
[1:08:25] wow what how many can give a hand clap
[1:08:28] to the Lord for that
[1:08:31] one
[1:08:33] wow how privileged are we
[1:08:37] then to be an attribute of this
[1:08:40] Supernatural
[1:08:43] God and the only way he can be known as
[1:08:48] Supernatural is through
[1:08:52] you
[1:08:55] I don't know nothing about the
[1:08:57] supernatural that's even
[1:09:00] better then you can't put your own ideas
[1:09:02] to
[1:09:05] it amen praise the Lord
[1:09:09] Jesus now order let's go back to what we
[1:09:13] said about the first time you begin to
[1:09:16] receive the baptism of the Holy
[1:09:22] go
[1:09:25] you're
[1:09:28] a a
[1:09:30] baby then you grow to be a
[1:09:34] child and then you grow to be an
[1:09:38] adult the problem is a lot of times have
[1:09:40] you ever seen a child just he's been
[1:09:43] crawling
[1:09:47] around he gets a hold of something he
[1:09:49] picks himself
[1:09:52] up and he tries to take a step and he
[1:09:54] falls on his
[1:09:58] face well he thinks he can
[1:10:00] walk but he don't have his balance
[1:10:05] yet that happens to you and me in the
[1:10:11] spiritual amen and amen amen now I would
[1:10:14] like to go to our second
[1:10:18] scripture in First Corinthians
[1:10:22] 12
[1:10:26] and I want you all to mark this
[1:10:28] down you will hear this scripture quoted
[1:10:32] probably hundreds of if not thousands of
[1:10:39] times here in the
[1:10:41] message because our messenger speaks
[1:10:44] about this scripture so many
[1:10:49] times and it seems like something so
[1:10:52] simple
[1:10:55] that we think we understand
[1:10:58] it oh I'm sure we understand it a little
[1:11:02] bit and I guess I better hurry up I'm
[1:11:04] almost already been going a half an
[1:11:07] hour but see I don't want to run with
[1:11:10] this I mean I got some stuff here
[1:11:12] that'll blow you off your
[1:11:18] seat but if you don't get the how to get
[1:11:21] the foundation right for it
[1:11:25] instead of getting you to go
[1:11:28] up you might not
[1:11:34] recover it'll do it'll make you or it'll
[1:11:37] break you as the old saying
[1:11:39] goes first Corinthians
[1:11:44] 1212 for as the body is
[1:11:49] one and have many
[1:11:52] members all the members of that one body
[1:11:55] being
[1:11:58] many are one
[1:12:01] body so also is
[1:12:05] Christ we're all members of members
[1:12:09] right but it's
[1:12:12] not 100
[1:12:14] people or 100
[1:12:17] bodies in the spiritual it's one
[1:12:20] body now watch this first part here of
[1:12:24] verse
[1:12:26] 13 for by one Spirit we are all baptized
[1:12:31] into one
[1:12:36] body whether we be Jews or
[1:12:39] Gentiles whether we be bonded or
[1:12:43] free and have been made to drink into
[1:12:47] one
[1:12:52] spirit how many have been baptized into
[1:12:55] the
[1:12:58] body okay justified by
[1:13:02] faith Sanctified cleansed satisfied for
[1:13:08] service then baptized with the Holy
[1:13:11] Ghost brother benam says you've been
[1:13:14] baptized into the
[1:13:17] body and the Pentecostal said oh boy
[1:13:20] that's
[1:13:21] it I'm ready for the
[1:13:26] Rapture no no you can be baptized into
[1:13:30] the
[1:13:32] body and not even know what part of the
[1:13:36] body you
[1:13:39] are but you're in the
[1:13:42] body but the mystery of what you
[1:13:45] are the mystery of
[1:13:48] us lays within that
[1:13:51] body as the Holy Spirit begins to
[1:13:54] baptize us over and over
[1:13:59] again until we begin to understand who
[1:14:02] we are in
[1:14:06] Christ and when we understand who we are
[1:14:09] in
[1:14:11] Christ there's not a devil that can take
[1:14:14] it away from
[1:14:16] us nobody that could ever treat us so
[1:14:19] bad that we would even get
[1:14:22] discouraged
[1:14:29] I tell you what we've been through some
[1:14:33] things look T like sometimes the hardest
[1:14:37] ones that learn how to get along
[1:14:39] together are the people in
[1:14:46] church we don't see what God's doing in
[1:14:49] our brother and
[1:14:52] sister
[1:14:54] if we could understand the same thing
[1:14:56] he's doing in
[1:15:00] us doing in
[1:15:03] them he's being patient with
[1:15:08] me can I be patient with my brother and
[1:15:13] sister can I look Beyond the Veil of
[1:15:15] this
[1:15:17] flesh and see that God is dealing with
[1:15:20] my brother and
[1:15:22] sister
[1:15:24] to see that they're growing in the
[1:15:26] Lord verse 14 for the body is not one
[1:15:33] member but
[1:15:36] many if the foot shall say because I am
[1:15:39] not the
[1:15:42] hand I am not of the
[1:15:46] body is it therefore not of the
[1:15:50] body now we know Brother David used the
[1:15:52] scripture sonay
[1:15:56] but as he was speaking on it this
[1:15:58] started to open up to
[1:16:03] me if the foot was to say to the
[1:16:09] head or the head to the
[1:16:12] foot I don't need
[1:16:15] you who's the
[1:16:21] head anybody
[1:16:23] there's got two or three answers that
[1:16:25] are correct so don't feel
[1:16:27] like it depends on depends on whether
[1:16:30] you're speaking in the spiritual or the
[1:16:33] natural well the head says I don't need
[1:16:35] no foot I don't need
[1:16:39] feet Christ doesn't need the
[1:16:42] feat or the pastor doesn't need the
[1:16:46] feet what does the feet

[1:17:01] feet Ephesians 5 go read
[1:17:05] it oh the head has it all but no unless
[1:17:08] somebody's prepared to take that
[1:17:14] gospel then the head can't do
[1:17:21] nothing the next verse
[1:17:24] and if the ear shall
[1:17:27] say because I am not the
[1:17:30] eye I am not of the
[1:17:33] body is it therefore not of the
[1:17:36] body what do the ear
[1:17:42] represent how does faith
[1:17:46] come Faith cometh by
[1:17:52] the so the ear can't say to the eye what
[1:17:54] does the eye represent come
[1:18:00] on the prophet of the
[1:18:03] age so you can't hear the the word of
[1:18:07] God and say that you don't need the
[1:18:15] prophet if the whole were
[1:18:17] hearing see is if the whole were hearing
[1:18:21] the next part of the verse see
[1:18:24] where would be the
[1:18:28] smelling where would be the
[1:18:33] discernment keep on going next
[1:18:38] verse if the whole body were an
[1:18:44] eye I don't need nobody to teach me the
[1:18:48] Holy Spirit anoints
[1:18:51] me
[1:18:54] the anointing teacheth me all things and
[1:18:56] I have no need for nobody to teach me
[1:19:01] nothing you're just saying you're you're
[1:19:03] your own
[1:19:07] eye where were the
[1:19:13] hearing go to the next verse Verse
[1:19:16] 18 now God has set the members in every
[1:19:20] every one of them in the body
[1:19:27] as it has pleased
[1:19:30] him amen
[1:19:33] amen next
[1:19:38] verse amen that's
[1:19:41] okay let's go to something yeah there it
[1:19:45] is but now are there many
[1:19:51] members yet but yet one
[1:19:58] body do we understand
[1:20:01] that in other words I can't do
[1:20:06] anything bottom
[1:20:09] line without affecting the
[1:20:15] body what we do oh I made the mistake on
[1:20:18] my own and you know this and that and
[1:20:20] the other you know I eventually I'll get
[1:20:22] right with
[1:20:28] God I Feel So Unworthy I'm just going to
[1:20:31] go over and sit in the
[1:20:35] corner and you think you're just hurting
[1:20:40] yourself no no because we're one
[1:20:45] body amen
[1:20:49] amen and the ey cannot say unto the hand
[1:20:53] I have no need of
[1:20:56] the that's what many in the message are
[1:20:59] saying
[1:21:01] today what does the eye represent
[1:21:05] again what does the hand
[1:21:12] represent fivefold
[1:21:14] Ministry so the prophet doesn't need the
[1:21:17] five home
[1:21:18] Ministry we just need the
[1:21:21] eye I saying to the hand I don't need
[1:21:29] you again neither the head to the feet I
[1:21:33] have no need of
[1:21:37] thee brother this is a boring
[1:21:40] message oh yeah but it's getting right
[1:21:43] down where we
[1:21:45] live yeah so we can really understand
[1:21:50] one
[1:21:51] another
[1:21:53] and truly love one
[1:21:55] another because if you don't make
[1:21:58] it I don't make
[1:22:03] it brother Tommy would always tell
[1:22:06] us the young ministers at that time
[1:22:08] would ask him real tell me what happens
[1:22:10] when you can't
[1:22:16] continue how are we going to make
[1:22:19] it and he says stick to
[1:22:25] together that's the only way you're
[1:22:27] going to make
[1:22:30] it I don't care what
[1:22:33] happens I don't care what the devil
[1:22:36] says I don't care what ever Rises up in
[1:22:39] the church
[1:22:44] together that's the only way you're
[1:22:46] going to make
[1:22:49] it my time is
[1:22:51] gone so I'm going to skip the second
[1:22:54] quote
[1:22:57] guys and I want to go to the last quote
[1:23:00] out of Hebrews
[1:23:05] 1 no it's the message Hebrews chapter
[1:23:10] one so we can see what the lights of the
[1:23:13] diamond
[1:23:16] are man I can tell you I get
[1:23:19] excited do you get
[1:23:21] excited
[1:23:26] now the
[1:23:27] diamond when it comes forth it's just a
[1:23:30] big smooth round piece of
[1:23:36] glass there are blue diamonds black
[1:23:39] diamonds emerald and a clear diamond
[1:23:41] white
[1:23:45] diamond
[1:23:47] Clos then when it's made and put into
[1:23:50] use there's a part of the diamond
[1:23:53] has to
[1:24:01] lose nobody likes to
[1:24:05] lose the chips off of
[1:24:09] it knocks little
[1:24:13] chips because when it comes into direct
[1:24:18] light it makes a
[1:24:21] sparkle
[1:24:22] the chip what makes the
[1:24:27] Sparkle is the way it's
[1:24:39] cut that's
[1:24:44] rough and one will be a green
[1:24:47] light the other will be a blue
[1:24:50] light maybe another an emerald light and
[1:24:54] a red
[1:24:55] light and the different lights go from
[1:25:00] it like a rainbow
[1:25:03] color they call it fire in the
[1:25:08] diamond now each one of those
[1:25:13] lights represents gifts
[1:25:19] represent you want to know
[1:25:22] there's a gift that goes with
[1:25:25] you every one of you has a
[1:25:30] gift what are you with me you're
[1:25:33] happy I got till 8:30 I'll be
[1:25:36] quiet we got to
[1:25:39] get
[1:25:41] am Christ is the
[1:25:44] diamond he was the one who came and was
[1:25:46] bruised and wounded and
[1:25:51] chipped
[1:25:54] that he might reflect himself back as
[1:25:55] the light of the
[1:25:59] world master
[1:26:03] Diamond that where the lights came
[1:26:07] from like we we saw in
[1:26:10] James every good gift every perfect gift
[1:26:15] come down from the father of
[1:26:19] light that's what it's talking about
[1:26:22] here
[1:26:26] now when these great lights went out or
[1:26:29] great rays of his
[1:26:33] Spirit love peace that's all there
[1:26:40] was there was no well better read it I'm
[1:26:44] getting I'm getting too crazy here there
[1:26:46] wasn't no
[1:26:49] suffering there was no hate oh wait a
[1:26:53] minute wait a minute there was no
[1:26:55] malice it couldn't come from that
[1:27:00] fountain that was
[1:27:03] Jehovah that was Jehovah
[1:27:06] God now the theologians call it a
[1:27:13] theophany that went from
[1:27:15] that which is called in the
[1:27:18] scripture the
[1:27:20] logos the logos that went out of
[1:27:24] God it's hard to
[1:27:27] explain it's the part of
[1:27:34] God these
[1:27:36] lights are
[1:27:39] gifts where did our spirit come
[1:27:43] from in the
[1:27:44] beginning where did our spirit rotate
[1:27:47] out
[1:27:51] of
[1:27:52] the logos
[1:27:55] Theos notice these
[1:27:59] lights also rotated out of the
[1:28:06] logos could it
[1:28:08] be that God was already
[1:28:12] thinking of the gift that we would
[1:28:16] need in our Earthly
[1:28:21] Journey and yet
[1:28:23] today I'm talking about in the message
[1:28:25] I'm not talking about out there
[1:28:30] anymore most people don't even want the
[1:28:34] gifts they say the perfect
[1:28:36] interpretation of the word has
[1:28:39] come which it
[1:28:42] has and that finished the
[1:28:45] gifts you cannot prove that to me with
[1:28:48] the
[1:28:50] Bible neither with all all of everything
[1:28:52] that the prophet
[1:28:55] says and if somebody would like to sit
[1:28:57] down and talk with me about
[1:29:01] that I would love it doesn't mean I know
[1:29:05] everything doesn't mean I can't learn
[1:29:07] from you I can definitely learned from
[1:29:11] you but all of what God has
[1:29:16] provided let's get our last scripture 1
[1:29:18] Corinthians
[1:29:20] 141
[1:29:22] and we'll
[1:29:24] finish even though we're not going to
[1:29:29] finish remember he said out of this
[1:29:31] Fountain came this pure Sweet
[1:29:36] Love Peace there was nothing
[1:29:40] else what kind of Love Is
[1:29:44] thato Love natural human
[1:29:48] love or is it Divine AG
[1:29:54] that's where it came out
[1:29:56] from and notice how Paul now with his
[1:30:04] prophe and his
[1:30:06] aposh is trying to help the Corinthians
[1:30:09] to
[1:30:11] focus on what's important
[1:30:16] first then God could put the gifts into
[1:30:20] operation
[1:30:24] in the correct
[1:30:27] way follow after Divine
[1:30:32] love
[1:30:34] charity how many can say
[1:30:36] amen and
[1:30:39] desire spiritual
[1:30:41] gifts how many have a desire for
[1:30:44] spiritual
[1:30:45] gift oh brother Jimmy you mean I have to
[1:30:50] prophesy speak in tongues you mean I
[1:30:54] have to interpret the
[1:30:56] tong what in the world is wrong with
[1:31:03] that no it's not the evidence of the
[1:31:05] Holy Ghost no no no
[1:31:08] no but it's what's coming out of the
[1:31:13] logos all those lights that came out of
[1:31:15] the
[1:31:17] logos right after you came out of the
[1:31:20] logos one of those lights that
[1:31:23] represents a
[1:31:25] gift he predestinated it for
[1:31:29] you and brother Bren even said I speak
[1:31:32] in tongues and more than all of
[1:31:35] you Paul said I I wish you would all
[1:31:38] speak with
[1:31:40] tongues do that mean we want a bunch of
[1:31:42] disorder in
[1:31:44] here we're not saying
[1:31:47] that we know the
[1:31:50] order how many of been here when the
[1:31:52] Holy Spirit speaks in
[1:31:55] tongues and then he brings the
[1:31:59] interpretation how many of that were in
[1:32:01] Silver City brother Danny you remember
[1:32:03] this C even sister Cecilia God used her
[1:32:07] in the
[1:32:10] gifts for a period of time brother Tommy
[1:32:12] set up the little
[1:32:16] room as we stand to our
[1:32:20] feet and that were gifted went in
[1:32:25] there they would put a brother in
[1:32:30] there paper and Pen maybe a
[1:32:35] recorder the Holy Spirit would
[1:32:39] descend someone would speak in
[1:32:42] tongues the interpretation would
[1:32:45] come and it hit like
[1:32:49] clockwork remember brother Danny
[1:32:52] well there be times when visiting
[1:32:54] ministers would
[1:32:56] come and we already knew what they were
[1:32:59] going to talk
[1:33:01] about we already knew some of the things
[1:33:03] that God was going to
[1:33:06] do
[1:33:08] gifts
[1:33:10] hogwash excuse me well brother Jimmy you
[1:33:14] speak in
[1:33:15] Tong better believe
[1:33:19] it all of a sudden I'm just praying and
[1:33:22] all of a sudden
[1:33:23] what where am I I think I'm in my
[1:33:26] closet I start speaking in an unknown
[1:33:31] time I'm not saying everybody has to do
[1:33:35] that then sometimes God starts telling
[1:33:37] me what I'm saying what it
[1:33:42] means and I write it
[1:33:44] down and I preach on
[1:33:47] it and it lines up with the
[1:33:50] word
[1:33:52] follow after
[1:33:56] charity
[1:33:59] desire he made to be in the
[1:34:05] church all nine
[1:34:08] gifts all nine fruits of the
[1:34:12] spirit all of God's divine
[1:34:15] nature that comes from his
[1:34:18] word must be here
[1:34:22] until the coming of the
[1:34:23] lord lord Jesus we just thank you
[1:34:29] Lord maybe a little different
[1:34:33] tonight we've had precious people God
[1:34:36] used them in the
[1:34:40] gifts but we may not be here
[1:34:45] forever if you your coming doesn't come
[1:34:50] as soon as we would think
[1:34:54] we need people that desire spiritual
[1:35:00] gift they want to find out the mystery
[1:35:02] of who they are in
[1:35:06] Christ which of those lights represent
[1:35:09] the gift that God wants to use in
[1:35:16] them so that it can continue to the
[1:35:19] coming of the
[1:35:20] Lord
