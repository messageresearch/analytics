[46:49] close to the confessional
[46:50] but working in different lives to bring
[46:53] his his world to perfect manifestation
[46:55] used a hundred different areas but i
[46:58] superpose it or not perfect the manifest
[47:00] accion we understand that when Jesus was
[47:02] to be more intrusive a nasara' a lot of
[47:07] things were taking place muchas cosas
[47:09] están siendo we see that John was also
[47:14] in the process to be born famous k1
[47:17] tambien star and the processor in a ser
[47:19] but he was dead
[47:20] the rest are immortal there was
[47:22] something that was gonna take place
[47:24] there yeah I'll go Kiva acontece energy
[47:26] and and we wait on that

[48:23] Louganis persecution started commensal a
[48:26] persecution many things happening muchas
[48:28] cosas Susi air on so we notice and I
[48:31] want to take the perspective of the
[48:34] scripture which is read 0 to male
[48:35] perspective LS key to wreck a car
[48:37] multi-layer that this Magi cases mangoes
[48:41] they are that were far away it's Tom on
[48:44] lejos and we read the scripture that
[48:46] says that they came asking the molesky
[48:50] to that case vinieron pregnant and where
[48:53] is he born king of Jews don't they start
[48:56] el rey de los ríos cannot see for we are
[48:59] come to worship him or camel Benito Alan
[49:01] early and a lot of people didn't know
[49:04] which I know Sevilla what they were
[49:07] talking about a kiss on Orlando and and
[49:10] when they speak of it it was a star that
[49:12] they saw and I learned they said only
[49:14] straight ya que you didn't know if I
[49:18] have a title for my message today will
[49:20] be the real Christmas story or what I
[49:22] see Papa don't eat Alamein say hey mr.
[49:24] noches area
[49:25] laverda historia de Navidad then maybe
[49:28] was subtitle of this er a visitor in
[49:32] concept it alone visit auntie they are
[49:36] they seen a star yesterday yeah a vmb
[49:39] still Estrella notice that when when
[49:42] Jesus was to be born cuando even a Sarah
[49:46] the scripture says that they saw the
[49:48] star in the East if today is the key
[49:50] it'll be your own Lester a journalistic
[49:52] but they came to Jerusalem the Rivini a
[49:54] turn ahead of Stalin even though Jesus
[49:56] was gonna be boring before him okay even
[49:58] a city-hero Celine well but from the
[50:00] perspective of the Magi xylose
[50:05] they saw the star over Jerusalem
[50:07] yesterday yes over the hill Celine where
[50:09] the Branham explains this granite guy
[50:12] said they was lined up the whole case
[50:14] tower I leave me I know the the the the
[50:16] the star looked like was over Jerusalem
[50:19] listeria para circus to Venus over here
[50:21] Celine pointing to bear for him up
[50:24] entendre a melon
[50:25] but from the perspective of the Magi
[50:27] Citadella perspective arrows mangoes
[50:29] they
[50:30] could see Jerusalem a useful yam there
[50:32] so they thought well is it's because of
[50:36] our knowledge as intellectual and smart
[50:38] man oh yes I mean perk of a kid no
[50:42] intellect oh come on brace intelligent
[50:44] this it is Jerusalem Jerusalem it's it's
[50:48] it lines up we know enough Selenia is
