with you and they want to think with a Kaila for letting me share so if you would all turn in your Bibles to Joshua chapter 6 first what first two to five and it says and it says and the Lord said unto Joshua I have given unto thine hand Jericho and a king thereof and a mighty man of Valor initial compassed the city all ye men of war and go round about the city once those shall do six days and the seven priests shall bear before the ark seven trumpets of rams horns and the seventh day ye shall come past the city seven times and a pre-shop low with the trumpets initial come to pass that when they make a long blast with the ram's horn and when he hear the sound of the trumpet all the people shall shout with a great shout and the walls of the city shall fall down flat and the people shall send up every man straight before them if you would all bow your heads for a word of Prayer the allure Jesus Christ Lord but there's nothing we can say Lord there's nothing we can do to describe your presence but we surrender our hearts to you Lord bless this precious students Church Lord bless your word Lord we love you Lord in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen so the title of my message is called instructions I got inspiration to preach this message when I was reading Joshua chapter 5 and 6 because God went because when God gave Joshua the instructions of how to take Jericho and Joshua gave us those same instructions so children of Israel you may be seated sorry God gave the same God gave the instructions of how to take Jericho to Joshua and Joshua case those same instructions to a children of Israel and to me that sounds like a perfect type of Christian family you know why because God He gave us the word the Bible and a message and he also gave us kids our parents our mom and dad two teachers and instructors according to the word tell us what to do and tell us what to not do according to the word and did you guys know that in the Bible God tells us kids how to treat our parents so if you were all turn in your Bibles to Ephesians chapter 6 verse 1 to 2 and it says children obey your parents in the Lord for it is right honor thy father and mother which is the first commandment with promise so what God says there is that us kids were supposed to honor and obey your parents because God says it is right well we all know that sometimes we make mistakes sometimes instructions they're hard to follow well let me tell you a story of what happened to me when I did not follow my mom's instructions so I was very sick so my mom gave me some pills and let me tell you what brothers I didn't need those pills I hit him anyway hit him in my socks I hadn't read my pockets anywhere I could pretending that I had aid in my medicine and guess what that night I was going to take a shower my mom told me and I I forgot that I had my morning pills inside my socks words they took off my socks the pills are flying and guess where they landed right next to my mom's foot so I was caught and my mom told me why didn't you eat your medicine I told her I just didn't 1/8 that medicine in the next morning I came after school and guess what Oh shocked because my mom was doing laundry and I saw pills all over my room because my mom she takes out everything out of her pocket she I discovered the pills that I had hid in my pockets that's the consequence I got even sicker and I had it to take the same amount of medicine to get myself better so now that we know the instructions are important to follow I see you guys boys what if Joshua went around the city of Jericho three times would you think the walls are come tumbling down yes and let's see the sisters what if Joshua went around the city of Jericho six times what you think the walls will come tumbling down you know why because God he gave Joshua a specific instructions of how to take teracle I went on shall follow those same instructions God blessed him and that that and God blessed him by making the walls of Jericho come down so did you guys know that instructions they're everywhere but you guys were on the Rope gonna children's church on your car there was instructional rules you guys had to follow I you guys were on the road what you guys barely stepped into church throws instructions and rules you had to fall in church and got placed in there for a reason just like he placed us here on earth for a reason that is to worship Him and then he asked you guys little kids a question how many of you guys like Legos let me tell you what I like Legos too so get a box of that so y'all know that they come with instructions inside of him so we use instructions to build Lego set and as we build them we be as we build it we use instructions right and if you just just throw away the instructions say what and you just do whatever you either end up with not enough pieces to build the Lego set or you will just have too many left over or you just simply don't have you have no clue how to build the legacy and we all know that our Bibles there are our instructions right here so we use the Bible to build and that say that we are a pieces so we uses the pipe Oh to build ourselves the way that God wants us and I will start building yourselves become better and better Christians every time and let's say that you just say you know what I'm gonna go the way that I think is that they that I think is right guess what brothers you will end up with the wrong structure it will all just all collapse they'll start your book start building yourself true kit because it's the wrong structure God doesn't want us to build himself like that he wants to us to build it the way that it's right which is the Bible that's why you have to follow and read instructions how many here knows that every time we come to church we come to listen to instructions did you guys know that like for example brother Caleb this morning he took he gave us instructions about how to become better Christians and how to use those things so we have to pay attention in church because sometimes you may be just sleeping around and guess what brothers quitting instruction comes you guys you guys might miss it that's and sometimes when you guys um when there's an important instruction that actually might help your Christian life and you're just dozing off sleeping guess what brothers you'll miss it so it's important to follow instructions and before I let you guys go I need you guys to remember obedience is better than sacrifice may God richly bless you [Applause] [Applause] Amen god bless brother James amen are you children ready I guess no maybe not you girls ready you want to hit the devil a good one you boys already all the girls are louder let's turn to our Bibles you have your Bibles this afternoon all right first Peter 2:9 it's you who's faster other girls or the boys if somebody has a say sword the Lord knows how to deliver the godly out of the temptation since and to the reserve the unjust but you are a chosen generation a royal priest priesthood and holy holy nation a peculiar people that you should show forth the praises of him who hath called you out of darkness but ye are a chosen generation I have a question what is the word peculiar mean design test Amar's I need somebody to help me strange oh that could be up anybody else man the killer people somebody different right we're different we're one of them see whenever you go to school and you're in the your friends look at you kind of weird or you girls the way you dress they thought you're weird they're not chopped they're not saying you're weird they're saying you're inaudible right you're different right kids when you go to school and the teachers tell you to do something you'll be your teacher but when you get home we don't want to obey the parents all right when we get stuck in the corner somewhere and the devil has you bound what are you gonna do ask for help that's when you want mom and dad to help you huh because I've been through it I was a perfect son in the whole world Yeah right huh but you know one thing look at the story of Josiah have you guys read the story of Josiah raise your hands yeah did you know he was a king in Jerusalem and he was only eight years old you imagine that he was only eight years old he was already a king coming from an evil father it was bad so you you think of that story and the devil tells you you're too small you can't worship the Lord don't go to church just stay home play your video games right think bad thoughts but but Josiah he knew what he had there's something inside of you childlike faith you know what that is not childish childlike faith there's a difference but we go through life and we say well I want to do whatever I want to do mom tells you throw the trash and you go to your room you act like you eat in here right mom says clean the room you just wash under the bed you go am i really done you know I know that for experience my dad will tell me we used to have like three acres of land he goes cleaned our yard again and I had a brother I have a brother he's handicapped on the wheelchair so I had something against the Lord I go why don't you kill my brother so he I'm like whew like my nephew says to Kayla you know so what we needed to do be like Samson right he wasn't at all man broadband said he was short maybe like me I don't know maybe like Reuben maybe like Noah but Samson he had to defeat a thousand Philistines a thousand demons was a jawbone magic one jawbone you have to do it so the devil the devil one day was walking down the desert he goes he saw a jawbone I dried up jawbone on the desert eagle what he's a mass destruction but what I can he's not gonna do nothing to me but he didn't know that some day it was gonna be used against him one day Samson was walking down he grabbed that jawbone I believe that the Lord put it there for a reason so if Samson could defeat the devil with a job on a mule what can God do with your jawbone how can you defeat the devil or yam I cannot take off your job on no I'm not talking about that right you got to speak the word right God use your job on the same like he did Samson right you believe that now look at the story of David and Goliath he was a big man right big maybe Goliath was maybe as big as what's your name again undress or maybe Yandel maybe you huh David Europe I just be little taller than they were shorter than David do you you probably could tell it better than me you know that I believe you but you look at the story what a David do but David said no it was too heavy for him so he only got his sling and a few pebbles from the river that were nice and flat so when he faced him he said do you come to me with a stick like thinking he was a dog he got one of the pebbles he's swinging them around and threw it right into his forehead and Goliath came crashing down what if Goliath say am i a dog you come to me with staves right that's what he said but I like what the Bible says whenever you get into problems circumstances we try to run away right I ain't gonna lie right but the Bible said that David ran towards a battle he didn't walk he ran towards the battle you got our one towards your problem sometimes like it or not you have to we got to confront the devil face to face as Dudley as he is and I mean right we have to confront the devil we try to run away from our pumps because I tried that many times it doesn't work it doesn't what we have to run towards a battle right so we go in and we see a we see this all these uh problems going on with David trying to organize trying to call him out they were David's men they were hiding in the tent for 40 days without coming out you imagine that and David just walked over to camp just to give him his lunch he wasn't there to go fight but you heard an uncertain sound he didn't like right and he said he ran towards the battle that's what we got to do sometimes maybe you're having family problems with your brother or your sisters you guys fight you guys gotta love each other right yes all right a man now we see looking at Josiah eight years old he didn't like all that sin that was going around the city right he was destroying all the images he was destroying everything that was in front of them the Bible said by the eighteen or nineteen years old he was there he really had money to rebuild the temple so what are we doing today trying to send money to Africa to ganda to rebuild a temple over there right that's where we're trying to do right look at Jesus when Jesus was not going to the cross what happened he fell the heavy was to cross I was on his shoulders I'm a heavy guy right he was carrying my sins and what happened there was a color man that came and helped them so there's no wrong there's nothing wrong if you guys asked for help somebody could help you your brother your sister could help you right if Jesus got how how much more us to carry the cross don't be ashamed to ask for help there is a lot of people here that could help you your parents will help you you say all my parents are mean no they're not that devil tells you that but they're not mean they're your best friends remember that so we go I mean I'm gonna read this to you Oh Samson okay what brother Balan says here he didn't have to go forward and say now wait let me take this jaw bone down and let me test it if you see if it works or not he didn't say that right so now when you go out you say devil get out of the way right leave my family alone leave me alone I'm tired of you you start moving your jawbone and start praising the Lord you start seeking the Lord Lord I need your help can we do that Lord where are you wet I need you but you got to be faithful you pray every morning we leave me sometimes I don't like to pray I'm not gonna lie but I do like to read I need to pray more so I should I come every Monday morning for the Lord calamy framework I cannot learn how to pray more so now we go through life and what happens we get stuck in a circumstances and how do you get out of it right we grow up and we say oh well I go to church I could be in the world a little bit at least my parents go to church I'm in the message so later on I'm gonna Cape I get married and I'll give my life to the Lord I don't work that way either take it or you leave it you gotta take everything inside of me right you look for the Lord and say Lord I'm right here do whatever you want with me Lord am I right or wrong well we're sometimes what happens we put on the armor which is the word of that there's no armor behind us you know why can somebody tell me why we don't have no armor behind us because it's not God the armor goes on front right when you go to battle there's nothing in the back you know why we don't have nothing in the back is we don't walk backwards we go forward right and another thing you have your brother back there fighting for you too so we have to help each other right so it's just a little thought that I had just one more scripture Philippians 4:13 I can do all things through Christ who strengthens me so the verses I could do some things or all things all things through Christ amen god bless you my my wow what a word we heard from Wow how old are you 8 years old Anna 40 year old can we give the Lord a hand clap of praise brother Daniel our

little bit but would you please stand I gotta say it again this little light a lot lighter mine I can't hide it I don't know if you anybody knows what that means but I'm gonna let it shine you know

project that's been taken a while they give you kind of a background on it about two years ago a group of people got together and made something that they felt inspired to do for the likes of you guys the older folks you might know a thing called adventures in Odyssey an old radio show that might ring a bell okay good awesome so my dad had come up with this idea to make a radio show of the sorts of just like that geared towards you guys to give you guys some form of a of an entertainment that you could listen to so myself and I believe uh Shanaya Gabe Ruthy maybe and and my dad we all got together and we made you guys but we are calling Bible travelers so to not talk to you all anymore and just let you enjoy it it is an audio story so just sit back relax and you're ready to be taken to another world and to another time so without further ado brothers and sisters Bible travelers [Applause] [Music] I've never in my life seen this place so thriving look at all these food choices does not belong to you oh please Olivia you act like I have a choice besides if Basia is hungry isn't that right that's yeah what did I tell you just because you're right doesn't mean I agree all right so where to today Beach the pier just run away and never look back very adventurous custard but not one thing not one that I believe what you manage today there's a storm brewing what storm I see not a problem in sight no one refers to storms this brews anymore Olivia Lorraine is messing up my hair come now bath you your hair is always a mess Costard your timing is impeccable I'm joking come on let's get out of this rain we'll never make it back to the but your even see out here I know there's an old library here we'll stay there what is this place well it's obviously a library we've gotten that far can you believe this all of history stored in these books every one of them from every era of time I wonder what's in them alphabetical order to look Amsterdam Arizona why is that one shiny maybe it's just a reflection that be agreeable but there's no light custard where is it reflecting from the light is coming from the book never seen one in person before I've heard the stories from this book miracles in past events in history maybe this can help us find a better future well it's enough for pretty much everyone that's had it running with it stay back stranger I'm the stranger no listen to me strict funny I'm just funny I'm just classy you look like the pillowcase I threw out this morning we actually did get that from you Josh you know I love your honesty mist batea he knows her name that's it I'm opening the book oh my goodness look at this I have sand in my jacket listen tell me what was your plan after you opened the Bible at me I figured the light would blind you and you would fall over well I mean it wouldn't be the first time good old Saul or Paul give or take a couple of minutes had that happened to him as well where parley well it appears we are in combat Kriya proximately well really far back BC that's impossible no no nothing is impossible with God's Word custard which apparently is the lesson we are learning today all right sandy pants it's time for you to start talking sandy pants you should see your head how do you know our names how are we here and how are you so calm about this well I am Burton C Dickens the librarian for now and keeper of the book and I know your names because a great man above knows your names as well and he tells me and you managed to open that Bible which just so happens to not only tell the story but live it you're wondering where we are we are on the battlefield of the great Goliath face me you spineless scum your finest army could not take on the mighty Goliath no way great pigeons household I shouldn't have complained about having messy hair yes very surprising and wild now I'm hide behind that rock by the way miss patty Oh messy hair can always be fixed darling it was a sacrifice Shirley needed to be taken yes why does he refer to himself as if he's someone else he had a big head yes he does it's bigger than my whole body why is he so angry well he is a Philistine the Philistines weren't exactly getting along with the kingdom of King Saul so they came to fight the people in that kingdom over there were terrified and knew that this man meant business however a young boy named David should be right on his way right about now does he ever shut up eventually see David went to King Saul explained how he wanted to defeat the Goliath for defying the Lord army King Saul found him and said no but David explained how he he was the shepherd of his father's people who know right David was a shepherd and in fact took on a bear and a lion both who attacked the Sheep he watched well the same way he's about to fight Goliath now [Music] [Music] you come against me with sword and spear and javelin the god of the armies of Israel whom you have defied the day the Lord will deliver you into my hands and I'll strike you down and cut off your head this very day I will give the carcasses of the Philistine army to the birds and the wild animals and the whole world will know that there is a God in Israel all those gathered here will know that this that it is not by sword or by spear that the Lord saves is the Lord's and He will give all of you into our hands this guy is off his marble will someone do something I think you might have cost an earthquake with a sling and a stone God use David to kill that massive giant with those two things David believed in his God so much that a small stone brought down the mightiest of warriors nowadays people have John it's all over their lives you may ask yourself what can I not overcome what giant stands before me and it's God's power you can do anything even the most impossible things like custard right there will always be Giants to attack us but there will be an even more giant God to have our back and fight a mighty Goliath no matter how small good because I'm very sleep what is he doing oh he said that he was going to chop off his head no wait just two more seconds Oh yikes looks like Ally is headed on out eh and so are we what day is it it's 333 as in you've been here for 20 minutes time travel remember custard let's do it again Oh Karen Lee mr. Dickens promise you won't steal anything hey don't look at me you did in here and act like you owned the place I mean it's a tough decision but I like the stories mr. Dickens I want to know more well battier in that case we must learn much more you may keep coming back every day or as much as you like the library is open to you but now by the look at the time you're going to be late for supper at the orphanage how did you know we were orphans but let's just say God has been keeping an eye on you and so have I you really think it was a coincidence you ended up here today custard no there are no coincidences here sir if you know our names our lives all of our stories what does that make you makes me your teacher your friend and your guardian angel I thought you looked familiar we'll be back tomorrow mr. Dickens promised and so to you who are listening a giant in our lives will surely fall if all we do is have faith in God when we call and physically in your life just remember him because all of your strife will soon get a trip until next time this has been well we don't have a name how about how about the Bible travelers yes that's it the Bible travelers I love it I am just so clever you know I mean God's clever too but I'm also equally clever in a way where we kind of match each other but he's better and I'm kind of down here we've kind of just like laugh at each other because we're really funny when you talk about things and that's far enough time [Music] [Applause] Wow did you enjoy that Wow I just lined up with the rest of the messages right on huh praise the Lord litter stand will sing one last song before we go before we dismiss oh how I love Jesus and in that as we sing it just close your eyes and just think about how much he loves you [Music] I love tea [Music] hi [Music] the [Music] Hey [Music] No don't you love [Music] [Music] to me so wonderful [Music] Oh [Music] Oh but to me [Music] [Music] when you go [Music] third Heavenly Father Lord as you come at our house Lord never from prison ports protect the start as we go home Lord in the name of the Lord Jesus amen amen may God richly bless you any give a hand to these fine young musicians like I did knock them down [Music]
