afternoon Lord with brother Noah and sister Rebecca as they have come to you Lord and have lived a Christian Life and have lived an ex e exemplary life in front of the Believers we ask father that you will bless them on their special day Lord may your hand of grace and mercy reach out to them Lord and may you that is the Fountain of all love come today Lord to fulfill their lives Lord we know that

the strengths that you have to them Lord we place them in your hands along with this congregation in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen you may be seated I thought it um appropriate to call this poem Noah and Becky we are also blessed to be able to witness such an event it is rare to find a love story with Purity the way it was meant lifting up Faith in a time when such living just doesn't seem plausible likening Christ and his bride proving with him anything's possible inspiring stares in Becky's eyes when Noah comes around a beautiful display of how love can speak without making a sound many have heard of Rebecca's beauty and how Isaac's love was almost more than he could handle Noah's smile for you says that Isaac Rebecca can't even hold a candle one day Noah you might have the privilege of growing old and gray all your teeth might be gone but still smile at her like you do today hair might be all white Becky and your vision failing and dim and yet may your eyes still twinkle every time you look at him remember marriage is not two it's actually three eventually so intertwined that Christ is the only one left to see because he's at the center holding you both and provides a place to meet especially when hard times come because they will but in the center there's no defeat Christ has given you today a good wife which is right up there with your salvation clearly you both have favor with God and and we'll build him a house with a strong foundation and if ever that house cracks or mold begins to enter pitch it with the Holy Spirit and come back to your Center everything inside of you says Becky was meant to be your bride returning your rib where it came from back to your side everyone here can tell a love story but yours will be one that's incomparable zero doubt two God people it's the making of a perfect Parable [Applause] congratulations you all look beautiful this afternoon you and Becky look beautiful as well amen it's a privilege uh and an honor to be here amongst uh all of you this afternoon um I I'm so grateful for all the efforts uh each and every one of you have made uh this afternoon to be here um to celebrate uh such a wonderful day um such a be with such a wonderful couple as you all um going back to when I first remember Rebecca doing something uh for Noah um they all started with donuts now she said the donuts were for my wife and I but I believe she had alterior motives in in that um they were pretty good they weren't your best but you were just beginning but recently she made his donuts and they were very very good you know today's an emotional day emotional day for for everyone here as a matter of fact uh the cake even has tears so took you a while to get it but you got it um but uh it's it's it's a joy this it's a joy this this this afternoon uh we're going to go into our scriptures as found in the book of First Corinthians 1 Corinthians uh chapter 13 and verse four and if anyone if anyone of you know this uh this passage of uh of scripture of this chapter it's called the love chapter charity suffereth long this is 13 uh 134 charity suffereth long and is kind charity envieth not charity vaunteth not itself is not puffed up does not behave itself unseemly seeketh not her own is not easily provoked thinking no evil Rejoice rejoiceth not in iniquity but rejoiceth in the truth beareth all things believeth all things hopeth all things and endureth all things charity never faileth amen may the Lord add His blessings to the reading of the word you know I was um I was thinking about when that when my wife and I got married uh 22 years ago um 23 years ago excuse me uh I'm already in big trouble um um but I remember my dad he he he my dad would find any any occasion to to preach the gospel didn't matter what where he was at what he was doing but I tell you our wedding day was was such a day that the only thing missing from from it was a prayer line he HD everything from tithing to Salvation New Birth and I'm there an hour and a half later waiting like that like but we're not going to do that today I'm not I'm short winded [Laughter] so but we're we're so grateful this this evening because 22 years ago see that's where I got the numbers mixed up 22 years ago we were sitting in the hospital my wife and I and um I had uh we had gotten up early in the morning and she said my water broke I'm like okay like what do we do now so there I was rushing down across the trailer going crazy thinking of what I'm doing what I'm what am I supposed to do and there she is as calm as a cucumber saying babe calm down time to go to the hospital I said okay okay I'm there're just just going crazy as we went to the hospital um she was in labor for for quite a few hours we had something uh something tragic occur at the time should have been tragic um as she was as she was delivering the doctor said uh the umbilical cord is wrapped around your baby his neck three times and your wife whenever she's she's she's pushing she's she's choking him almost to death he said we're going to have to do emergency uh an emergency C-section as as it uh as they took her in uh to to prep her he came out again and he said I have I have some news for you I said he said he said it's either going to be your wife or it's going to be your child but it ain't going to be both at that moment I I went with my with my dad as as he was in the as he was in the waiting room I told him the news I said Dad it's I it's it's not going to be both it's it's it's either or he said well let's pray about 10 minutes passed I I went to go check on my wife I came out and and to see what what was going on and he goes I just received a vision from the Lord he said both of them are going to make it and sure enough about 45 minutes later precious baby boy came out and 22 years today because of that because of that he is here today and what a Wonder ful thing it is what a wonderful blessing he he is for my wife and I not just for us but for many around him I look at their relationship and I see how how beautiful Rebecca is how sweet and how kind and how much she loves the Lord and I can say that it comes from a man and and and a a man and a woman a brother and a sister that have put in put their time their effort and their love and to their daughter and I would say brother Robert sister spring congratulations for for raising such a wonderful a wonderful daughter you look in you look in uh in relationships nowadays and pretty much anything goes you know it's very very rare do you find a relationship do you find a a courtship an engagement and into a marriage that started off pure and ended pure you don't find that and to see a couple that has done things the correct way the right way and it really you can really see in in these in these uh verses of scripture that we just read said that yes it endureth all things that love not just for each other because it just doesn't take two in a marriage many people that's what that's what they think well it's just my wife and I and that's not the case the case that in every marriage that it takes three and when you have Christ as the center of your marriage Christ as the center of your love and your relationship there is nothing that comes against you that you cannot handle and that's why love endureth all things because God not just not does he just express love but he is love and when we see see that whatever comes whatever whatever arises because things will get difficult just ask any married couple here things aren't always peaches and cream things are difficult sometimes the road gets a little bumpy the road gets hard but you have those times not just to lean on each other but to lean on the Lord because he is why he is the reason why we are here you know as I was um as I was uh thinking about your relationship and and all the the the times that we've had you know God gave me three boys for a reason and the reason was because I could have such precious daughters and it's one down two to go so I'm thankful this morning or this afternoon for what God has blessed us with blessed us with a son now he has blessed us with the daughter and if I can say if these words that have been spoken this this this afternoon if I can just say it anything or if you can just remember anything remember that at the the center is Christ always always amen and I pray that the Lord would bless you and keep you and if there is anything any any relationship that you could look at I always I always see my uncle Ross my auntie Ruth if you want to see a a a relationship that has endured and that has be all things believed all things and hoped all things I don't know where my Aunt Ruth is at I know my uncle Ross couldn't make it Auntie what did you stand for you and for uncle Ross they've married 60 years my auntie my uncle thank you Auntie they are a blessing and they are heroes and with what they've gone through we know that we can make it as well so may God bless you may God keep you amen and and once again for for everyone that has that has come we are so so honored and so grateful and so thankful to have you all amongst amongst the amongst our midst thank you once again God bless you [Applause] you're anxious huh yeah I can tell all right I was there at one time it's your decision whether you want your story to be a parable or if you just want to be another story a parable is an Earthly story with a Heavenly meaning and only the bride of Christ has a he has an Earthly story with a Heavenly be everyone else is just Earthly stories but you will choose from this day forward what you will do with your lives and how you will you will live your life but I'm very proud of both of you I want to tell you as your pastor I'm proud to be your pastor I'm proud that you all have done you've chosen to do things right there's a plan that has been laid out you follow the plan and it's brought you here keep following the plan it'll take you home so as you stand I guess we might as well after will said what he said I was seriously thinking about ties and offerings and and getting a long sermon going again but if I start I ain't stopping for a long time it's an honor to be here with you along with all you witnesses that have come God bless you it's always a pleasure to see new and old friends that have come to be with us in this tremendous celebration before I go on I want you to look through the veil look at her is that the one you worked seven years for oh just making sure you

okay making sure well Ephesians the 5ifth chapter CH tells us verse 31 says for this cause shall a man leave his father and mother shall be joined unto his wife and they too shall be one flesh this is a great mystery but I speak concerning Christ and the church nevertheless let every one of you in particular so love his wife even as himself and the wife see that she reverends her husband now let's get into it all right dearly beloved we are gathered here together in the sight of God and the face of this company to join together this man and this woman in holy matrimony which is commanded by St Paul to be honorable among all men it is therefore not by any to be entered into unadvisable or lightly but reverently discreetly soberly and in the fear of God and into this state this holy state that these two persons present that they're present come to be joined if there's anyone here that can show a Just Cause as to why they should not lawfully be joined together in this holy matrimony do you now speak or from Hereafter forever hold your peace I will require and will charge you both as you will surely answer at the day of judgment when the secrets of All Hearts shall be disclosed if there's either of you that know any impediment why you should not be lawful joined together in this holy matrimony do you now confess it or be it assured unto you that any couples that are joined otherwise than God's word doth allow their marriage is not lawful but duly believing you have considered this solemn obligation you're about to assume and that you have prepared to enter upon the same reverently discreetly soberly in the fear of God I shall propose to you the marriage covenant you will witness the same as you join your right hands together I ask you brother Noah brother William Noah will you have this woman to be your lawful wetted wife to live together in this holy state of matrimony do you promise to love and honor and cherish and support in sickness or health riches or poverty do you promise to always speak good of her in her presence as well as her absence will you forsake all others as long as you both shall live I do you like that you like that one yeah was it
