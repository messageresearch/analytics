[44:30] if the believers position is in Christ
[44:33] in a position that current is increased
[44:35] oh and Christ is heavenly places if he
[44:38] stirs new catalysts yes then the
[44:39] believers position is a condition that
[44:42] we must go into total opposition
[44:44] Delacroix Yenta isn't a condition and I
[44:46] read this in fact from our founding
[44:47] pastor Leo s or the Nestor water just
[44:50] for those maybe that weren't here if
[44:52] parents can understand where we're going
[44:54] today in OCD he moves and he says this

[46:39] consolidate don't descend here Don but I
[46:41] want you to to get that pair okey-dokey

[46:47] ever gonna be lost once again personally
[46:49] there cos they're on the pill you cannot
[46:50] ever be in the rapture no I play the
[46:53] sadness or not thinking that you're
[46:54] gonna be lost son Lucas ever better they
[46:56] gotta get that idea and we gotta throw
[46:58] it in the trash Jimmy can I say they
[47:00] Piniella love a Sulha and that's one of
[47:02] the hardest things for a human to do yes
[47:05] soon I'll ask oh so much would ask us
[47:06] get rid of an idea you need because for
[47:10] one an idea what can i risk if any that
[47:14] has gone into the mind he can throw them
[47:17] in that has been accepted by a human
[47:19] being
[47:19] yes yourself telepon amano it is almost
[47:22] impossible to eradicate discuss the
[47:25] impossibility way I'm gonna say that
[47:27] again right that we get a lot of ideas
[47:29] then which I see a lot of thought
[47:32] would you spin cement ideas it is it
[47:35] means this get it I see this it's any
[47:38] conception is quick it concept soon
[47:41] existing in the mind existing element as
[47:44] a result of mental understanding a motor
[47:47] so talent elemental meant an awareness
[47:49] or activity they do not TV that all
[47:51] ideas an impression or an opinion do
[47:55] name press your know your opinion of
[47:57] view or a belief Yona beast they
[47:59] mr. McCray insya and an idea is also a
[48:03] groundless supposition or fantasy only
[48:06] there isn't a fantasy I'll go seem
[48:08] fundamental an idea is a conception of
[48:11] what is desirable you know there has
[48:13] been a concepción they'll go this year
[48:14] and it can also be a mental image that
[48:17] means they don't need them and that is
[48:18] why we have to get rid of all our ideas
[48:21] what is it any case as they don't know
[48:22] it tosses any idea that cannot be
[48:25] verified but get me there can request a
[48:27] pity for not founded upon God's Word is
[48:32] Antichrist idea as soon as the other
[48:34] crystal must be removed by the root it
[48:38] in the case of this ray God Allah is
[48:39] relevant search because I can't because
[48:41] those ideas are what is hindering us
[48:44] today but case I see their son las que
[48:46] no sister no you cannot move out of our
[48:48] condition into another look when was in
[48:50] Telugu they will not cook this you know
[48:51] only glad we have too many ideas forget
[48:54] them which I see there when you when you
[48:56] talk to people but the LA was gonna say
[48:58] well I guess I'll never be able to do
[49:01] this or have this this is not what you
[49:03] said is why there are too many things
[49:04] that that that are impeding or keeping
[49:07] it from happening
[49:08] what can we just closed a case a
[49:09] low-impedance there Cantus era but this
[49:11] is why people rarely change their
[49:13] dwelling places put a still a hint them
[49:15] which is Escambia because people can't
[49:17] move out of the condition or can open at
[49:19] least they will knock on this you mean
[49:20] that there are too many ideas indicate
[49:23] emphasis they that have taken root in
[49:25] their soul remember what we talked about
[49:28] last last Sunday a quality local em was
[49:31] a little more soul is what determines
[49:33] the condition of the spirits Ellen must
[49:35] locate them in a lock on this yonder
[49:37] because no soul is the nature of that
[49:39] spirit porque la mulana to release a
[49:41] list now if we can get rid of those
[49:43] ideas see those promises like get them
[49:45] and throw them in the trash yes I see
[49:47] the official doing so
[49:49] porque put a certain you start to see
[49:52] your condition change Santa Senators to
[49:54] condition K come because it's the ideas
[49:57] that keep you bound for case also see a
[49:59] skeleton in a silo sane is very good is
[50:02] that a masters move when drawing ideas
[50:04] in our head and polyandry they are
[50:06] sinister
[50:07] I think you all fight a fight without
[50:09] everyday huh look at those belly I'm
[50:11] most convenient least get a few hundred
[50:13] ideas every day but - Stella theology
[50:15] agency cannot even say a thousand but no
[50:18] I still mean listen we get a lot of
[50:19] funny ideas on Megan Mucha cetera and
[50:22] then when you really stop and think
[50:24] about it
[50:24] local no para pensar then you ask
[50:26] yourself you you you you you have to ask
[50:28] yourself this yellow se tiene que una
[50:30] pregunta res where did that idea come
[50:32] from
[50:33] they don't Diego stay there maybe we
[50:34] heard it or it's a slow mo maybe
[50:37] somebody on the news or somebody had a
[50:41] great idea
[50:44] the problem is is that we're married
[50:48] it's gossip that Moses says that's what
[50:49] ideas are their seeds let's see there's
[50:52] ones to Mia's and and those seeds make
[50:54] us bitter and angry
[50:57] here's the semiosis in a matter goes
[50:59] hello how was last the model and and
[51:01] that's the hardest that it brings yes is
[51:04] let go say Chucky try our ideas let's
[51:06] see there yeah they really play a lot of
[51:09] favoritism in that church boy for what
[51:11] it is that's somebody's idea so when you
[51:14] follow that what those tests II guess
[51:16] you ask yourself the question before you
[51:18] plant the seed so they make a salute and
[51:21] discipline the harvest am I gonna have
[51:23] with that kick lesson about how many
[51:27] really stop and think for a moment that
[51:28] up in how do you ever stop when you get
[51:31] an idea still they see when he's there
[51:33] and say what will the results be of this
[51:36] idea
[51:36] Karen us in Lourdes what does they stay
[51:38] there come on think about this for a
[51:40] moment

[51:42] harvest be of this idea give us a lick
[51:45] Costa it's gotta be planted listen so
[51:50] what will the hardest be come on Sara la

[1:10:10] Silas Quint that game I want to rapture
[1:10:12] in condition how many want to want to
[1:10:13] keep on learning this morning thought
[1:10:15] the kids they get up in an endo there
[1:10:18] was a many of you know it years ago they
[1:10:22] there was a question that was asked I
[1:10:24] end up but it won't that case a so and
[1:10:26] it was said that 80% of kindergarteners
[1:10:29] got it okay you thinking oh the
[1:10:30] percent alone is de la Dale and the
[1:10:33] squalor chick prime area and eighty Law
[1:10:34] Center on college graduates didn't get
[1:10:37] it he loved the muzzle collection I
[1:10:39] remember that what was acquitted on and
[1:10:41] the question was this la pregunta Rasta
[1:10:44] what is greater than God casemis Grande
[1:10:47] more wicked than the devil he must Malik
[1:10:49] El Diablo the rich people need it los
[1:10:53] críticos one necesitan poor people have
[1:10:56] it in Los Padres lo tienen and if you

[1:11:17] he older my lasagna it no position a
[1:11:20] docent in there well and you think about
[1:11:21] that cuando habla the answer is easy

[1:30:48] more didn't look it we run in Pentecost
[1:30:49] when our part of the Covenant was throat
[1:30:51] back but there's the part of the mistral
[1:30:53] back to where is China trust you
[1:30:55] couldn't have nothing to do with it stay
