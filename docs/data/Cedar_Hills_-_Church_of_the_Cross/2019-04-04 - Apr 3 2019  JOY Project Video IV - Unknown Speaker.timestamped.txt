[28:35] just keep us in your prayers
[28:37] [Music]
[28:54] we are here my sister Paula today to ask
[28:57] her some questions about her testimony
[29:01] okay so my first question is how did you
[29:07] come to know the Lord Jesus actually I
[29:12] came to know the Lord through viola and
[29:15] brother Tommy I was baptized and
[29:21] Apostolic Church first and then when we
[29:24] came across the message of the hour
[29:28] Tommy later he baptized me in brother
[29:33] Nick's church and from then I started my
[29:39] walk with Jesus and what year were you
[29:43] baptized to do
[29:45] [Music]
[29:49] 1973 or for actually I was going to a
[29:55] simply of God Church in Oklahoma and we
[29:59] had a brother that came to give it a
[30:02] revival certain services and during his
[30:07] ministry as he was ministering to us he
[30:11] said something about is that if brother
[30:14] Brent said he saw an angel I believe he
[30:17] saw an angel and I was like stunned I've
[30:21] never heard of angels coming to people
[30:24] down here on earth and so I started
[30:26] thinking about who brother Branham was
[30:29] and at the time tommy was just coming in
[30:34] into the message and anyway that's
[30:39] that's not what I came across the
[30:41] message okay so you said he came to know
[30:46] the Lord Jesus through our founding
[30:47] pastor so when did you first meet our
[30:51] family pastor
[30:52] [Applause]
[30:54] I meant oh yes when I graduated from
[30:58] high school by all sentient ticket to go
[31:03] to California and when I got to
[31:06] California Tommy and viola met me there
[31:09] so that was first time I met Tommy and
[31:13] when did you start attending Cedar Hills
[31:15] well
[31:17] [Music]
[31:19] we moved out here in 1984 but we had
[31:23] been going to church with Sami for a
[31:24] long time
[31:25] that as far as Cedar Hills Tabernacle
[31:29] that was would be 1984 of them we had
[31:33] already been coming back and forth from
[31:36] Oklahoma and having services with him
[31:40] what is it that keeps you going in life
[31:44] the what keeps me going
[31:47] is the message of the hour and the
[31:54] fellowship that I have with my brothers
[31:56] and sisters and just a promise that one
[31:59] day I'm going to see my sister my dad
[32:03] they're all but brother branham and that
[32:10] keeps me going so much but the word and
[32:15] knowing that one day we will be out of
[32:19] here how do you maintain your
[32:23] relationship with the Lord Jesus praying
[32:26] every day listening to the message every
[32:29] day reading our Bible and just having
[32:34] fellowship with my brothers and sisters
[32:37] what is the source of your success well
[32:42] baked wheat to my spouse and to the word
[32:46] that I have heard trying to do because
[32:50] as honest and
[32:54] faithful is that can be and what is the
[32:58] he delighted for you the key to life is
[33:03] first God then my my family pastor has a
[33:09] lot to do with who I am today if it
[33:13] wasn't for him I don't know who I'd be
[33:15] because he cared so much about us that
[33:19] when he lived when we lived in Oklahoma
[33:21] he would go they would go at least once
[33:24] a month to minister to us and I will
[33:28] never ever forget that is that I do like
[33:31] to this I love my children my
[33:33] grandchildren and I just thank my
[33:36] grandchildren and my great-grandchildren

[33:43] two girls right now at first I had my
[33:47] five granddaughters that started the
[33:50] ball rolling I guess and the one talking
[33:52] right now is one of the best yes what is
[33:57] your favorite message of brother ground
[33:59] on food my favorite vestige of brother
[34:01] branham is the Hebrews the series that
[34:04] he preached only people because it
[34:06] covers just that everything that he's
[34:09] ever preaching and I just love to hear
[34:12] it what is your favorite song operate
[34:16] that art and they not have another song
[34:18] that is very precious to me because I
[34:24] oh I guess I don't know what you'd call
[34:27] it but I was troubled for many years and
[34:31] and I just couldn't get the picture of
[34:34] the over what I was going through and
[34:38] one day or one night when I was sleeping
[34:41] I had a dream and I was thinking that
[34:47] song and the name of Jesus bigness will
[34:50] have to flee and through that song
[34:53] it it brought me my deliverance
[34:56] and ever since then I haven't had any
[34:59] problems with that spirit that would
[35:01] come against me and I thank God for it

[41:10] pull from Lord and historic church in
[41:17] 1969 and then I I didn't stick to it I
[41:25] bought it all the way so actually I did
[41:29] I need coming to this message did
[41:33] and that was the year we started I had
[42:02] [Music]
[42:12] [Music]
[42:19] over there and okay I was baptized in
[42:51] 1969 the other story church but it was
[42:54] in I want to say that about 1982 or 83
[43:02] but there was a few of us there Cedar
[43:06] Hills that we've got be baptized in the
[43:12] Gila River in February it was freezing
[43:17] pretty much you can probably read
[43:19] affected see I came in when I met Tommy
[43:25] assessment now when I really wanted to
[43:29] serve or I wanted to come into the
[43:31] message I got into the medicine about 77
[43:34] and I was the message wasn't in me I was
[43:38] in the message and then in seventy
[43:42] seventy seven when we wouldn't do
[43:44] Phoenix just when Tommy baptized because
[43:47] I asked him to baptize me before we went
[43:50] to feast he said no I'm not going to
[43:52] baptize you and why he told me that I
[43:55] don't know and I said you're not gonna
[43:57] baptize me yes as well then I'm gonna go
[43:59] with each other with each of you because
[44:03] we had a house in El Paso and bought we
[44:05] couldn't sell it and when I told him
[44:07] that I was gonna finish so that we went
[44:10] home that week and the next morning we
[44:30] packed everything up and I was hungover
[44:33] because we were on the way to Phoenix
[44:40] don't make us as well so we get the
[44:42] money for the house we keep going I will
[44:45] give me six pack of beer is like that I
[44:46] have something so you got in the truck
[44:49] we got the Emmy
[44:51] I got the Deming I bought them all of
[44:53] them something to eat and everything
[44:55] else when that six pack of cokes we all
[44:58] drink cokes and everything else and it's
[44:59] more than I could have possibly in it I
[45:01] need my beer I'm gonna suspect for me I
[45:05] said it
[45:06] by their guidance but that the before
[45:10] that was the last day I ever drank a
[45:12] beer and the Lord just took it from
[45:15] before Monday together without me
[45:16] realizing what he does welcome back to
[45:19] Phoenix I took time you okay now I'm
[45:22] here not only get baptized he said well
[45:27] let me ask brother Bernie so brother
[45:29] Bernie said well what are you waiting
[45:31] for disco so brother Bernie and brother
[45:33] Tommy got into the pool from baptized so
[45:36] I got double portion I got it from
[45:40] Bernie and Kentucky they hadn't been for
[45:42] Tommy and brother Bernie I probably
[45:45] wouldn't be this message because I think
[45:48] it was about a year after that that the
[45:51] message was in me but till that time the
[45:54] message was not any too happy we got a
[45:57] Baptist and that's how I came to know
[46:01] Tommy and the message was because of
[46:05] himself and what is I'll start with you
[46:14] granny what is what is the key
[46:16] what is your key of life what is your
[46:18] source of success what keeps you going
[46:21] when we were going to see her heels
[46:28] Church I know it was God through Tommy
[46:35] that has kept us all these years because
[46:41] of how one great pastor he was to us
[46:46] and and through the years
[46:53] the word the message brother branham
[46:58] when I first came in a message that I
[47:01] used to dream brother better a lot and
[47:07] drove that that's what has kept me in
[47:11] this message and and I know without a
[47:14] shadow of doubt that I forgot past me
[47:20] and and I'm so thankful for the history
[47:25] for where he has placed us and that
[47:31] there's nothing that will take that away
[47:33] from us just a message without the
[47:40] message you have nothing that is the
[47:43] source of my life I did so because all
[47:47] the time that I was with Tommy we was a
[47:49] missionary crystal water hot to Mexico
[47:51] City to all the places that Tommy and I
[47:54] used to go it was all of the entire that
[47:57] went and then finally I think the last
[48:00] work trips we made is when we took my
[48:03] Ola and me colorless and Jody and my
[48:06] buddies and now and that was what we
[48:13] used to go to missionary trips but of
[48:15] course that's not the way he gave back
[48:16] there before anybody even usual tommy
[48:19] was very very was a center of the
[48:22] attraction then and we went it there and
[48:25] in the sense of speaking that's what
[48:27] what investment time we broke the ice of
[48:30] who he was in Mexico
[48:32] he went in there and then they accepted
[48:35] him because of mother birdie backed him
[48:38] up and they got to know who Tommy was
[48:41] and that's what the court was looking
[48:42] for us they were all the Mexico and they
[48:45] invited our church but I remember that
[48:50] so the state because we used to go to
[48:53] Mexico when we get there we have to find
[48:56] our way to get a rental car nobody was
[49:02] there to pick us up take us to the
[49:04] church we have to find the church I used
[49:06] to be the driver I drove what a hata to
[49:09] the churches and everything else and let
[49:10] me tell you if you can drive a lot of
[49:13] how they invited many more and I
[49:15] remember that very distinctly what we
[49:18] put really captured my mind about you
[49:21] know how that was the last time we went
[49:24] by all that Tommy unique I myself we
[49:28] stopped at this place is Tommy wannabe
[49:31] it was a little right outside of what
[49:35] other it wasn't arrested it was a truck
[49:38] stop the way she was oh she everything
[49:44] had to be perfect we sat there there was
[49:47] flies all over the place would be
[49:50] hitting the flight to set there Nathan
[49:53] they surprised me the chief would be one
[49:57] that oh no I'm not going to eat there
[49:59] she's with us but that was something
[50:02] that I'll never forget so it was the
[50:04] last trip that we made
[50:07] and because of that because what Tommy
[50:10] has shown me the light that mended it's
[50:22] the Holy Ghost was in that man and Tommy
[50:24] always preached don't follow me follow
[50:28] what's here and that so they never put a
[50:32] man before God I don't care for the
[50:35] babies God heal the man and you see the
[50:40] man and if you can see God in that man
[50:42] probably man if you don't see God in him
[50:46] but find somebody else
[50:48] and that's when I found up and Tommy
[50:53] made me promise him that I would not
[50:57] leave this church no matter what he said
[51:01] if something happens to me I don't want
[51:04] you and he made me promise in that and
[51:09] that's nothing to take me from the
[51:11] future no matter how what how everything
[51:15] is Tommy showed me what God can really
[51:18] do we have seen so many miracles so much
[51:22] just walking with time and that is
[51:27] Dennis have got me a virgin
[51:32] have you had maintained your
[51:35] relationship with the Lord and her
[51:38] brothers and sisters in Christ and your
[51:39] family
[51:43] because of the love of Christ that's
[51:49] that when we can see Christ in our
[51:53] brothers and sisters and and that's what
[51:57] keeps us not knowing that what we have
[52:01] is is something real and do you have I'm
[52:09] sorry grandma do you have any advice as
[52:11] a Christian is alive with grandparents
[52:14] anything for use
[52:18] I was trying to be a good example to to
[52:25] our youth our children and and if they
[52:32] if they can see if you can be a great
[52:37] example to them then they in turn
[52:41] they'll want don't want to be a
[52:46] Christian so it's very important to to
[52:49] be a good example wherever you go
[52:51] whatever it is you can the only advice I
[52:56] have for young people is don't look at
[53:01] anybody as our own look at Christ see
[53:06] the life they need not don't worry about
[53:08] how good-looking they are how they act
[53:12] see how see how how much love they
[53:17] project before you even want to be like
[53:20] anybody but what you really want to be
[53:22] like to see Christ
[53:23] if you develop somebody you love
[53:26] everybody you show them love no matter
[53:29] what I'm sure you'll get angry you'll
[53:32] get mad but always remember you're going
[53:35] to live with them for the rest of your
[53:37] life so you need to love them they show
[53:39] up above no matter what they do and
[53:41] especially for you see you won this bout
[53:44] love the shoulder that's what they need
[53:47] not what they're up in this day when
[53:51] they're down low nobody wants nothing to
[53:53] do
[53:54] the goal of they show over those
[53:59] you want to thank you appreciate just
[54:04] money but not just me but of course all
[54:07] of your brothers and sisters I have one
[54:11] more question so we'll call this one of
[54:13] the bonus question you guys don't have
[54:23] to answer because I know that there
[54:24] might be a few people offended by this
[54:27] question about what you might say but
[54:34] who's your favorite grandchild
[54:36] [Laughter]
[54:57] [Music]
[55:00] so first question how long have you been
[55:04] serving the look so you started serving
[55:13] in the Lord about 130 years but you were
[55:15] not in the message where were you before
[55:17] there you well it started to the message
[55:45] [Music]
[55:54] and where you are the timing hearing for
[55:57] this or were you there and somewhere
[55:58] else all right second question how were
[56:06] you introduced to the message of the
[56:09] hour and I surely would like to do this
[56:20] in that story
[56:26] [Music]
[56:50] [Music]
[57:11] [Music]
[57:37] [Music]
[57:39] so that they would kind of watch over me
[57:42] but they didn't live close but the Lord
[57:49] spoke to me and told me get out of that
[57:51] long study group and so I got out of it
[57:55] and right after that my uncle comes who
[57:59] is a brother of my dad and he's in the
[58:02] message and he said come on I want to
[58:06] take you somewhere I want to show you a
[58:08] church and so he took me and my my aunt
[58:13] Virginia she goes to the church there
[58:16] and where we're at and from there on and
[58:20] when we walked inside the church where
[58:23] brother Caleb preaches we started
[58:27] weeping I mean we could feel the hot the
[58:30] Spirit of God immediately immediately
[58:33] and we started crying
[58:36] and and it was like we had it just felt
[58:40] like a bubble bath and so we got out and
[58:45] from there on we started going to church
[58:48] they're like my prayer was answered
[58:51] after going out into the mountains and
[58:55] and I was told get out of there at
[59:05] church of Cedar Hills which was not that
[59:09] at that time it was so your that was in
[59:20] it was just me my dad kind of he had
[59:25] received the Lord but he did not was not
[59:27] born again until later and and he was
[59:34] objecting at first and my mother came in
[59:37] I invited her to go to church and I
[59:40] invited dad too and when they came
[59:46] Caleb's sister still remembers if it
[59:50] were yesterday they had a picnic at
[59:54] young park I think it was and my parents
[59:59] went and that's where they got to
[1:00:02] talking to my started coming and then
[1:00:13] she got and then my dad started coming
[1:00:16] but he was resisting because he was deep
[1:00:19] into the Catholic Church where they were
[1:00:25] Indians you know that they believe in
[1:00:28] the Walla looping and tire and they
[1:00:32] start dancing and altering dances to her
[1:00:37] and stuff like that well my dad was
[1:00:38] involved in that he started coming to
[1:00:45] church - sure well that's good that's
[1:00:48] wonderful it's a nice story so the Lord
[1:00:51] answer your prayer out there my mother

[1:03:53] that I need I need
[1:04:00] [Music]
[1:04:05] hi Ruby yes I'm going to speak today
[1:04:08] about my journey to where I am today I
[1:04:12] was born into the Apostolic Faith
[1:04:15] Movement right before I was born though
[1:04:18] my mom became a Christian and before
[1:04:21] that she was a strong Catholic was
[1:04:23] married into the Catholic Church her
[1:04:26] sisters and her had been searching for
[1:04:28] the truth and were visiting other
[1:04:30] churches and they came to Las Cruces
[1:04:33] intended an apostolic meeting and there
[1:04:35] they had a true Holy Ghost experience so
[1:04:38] my mom my mother and all her siblings
[1:04:40] were baptized in Jesus name and received
[1:04:43] the Holy Ghost one after another but
[1:04:45] something kept moving them and they went
[1:04:48] on to they joined the UPC but soon left
[1:04:51] and became independent Pentecostal they
[1:04:54] used to have Church and in houses but
[1:04:56] that time my mother already had six
[1:04:58] children one of the places we've Health
[1:05:01] Services was in my uncle Robert barreras
[1:05:03] home he told my mother and her sisters
[1:05:05] if they wanted a church that he would
[1:05:07] build them one so he did and he had an
[1:05:10] insight and he built a church and it was
[1:05:13] the shape of a pyramid and we didn't
[1:05:15] even know the message at the time and we
[1:05:17] went to a revival meeting in Duncan
[1:05:21] Arizona and this brother brother Roy
[1:05:24] Mims was preaching and we heard him with
[1:05:27] us when we first heard the message of
[1:05:29] the hour and it was around 1960 1969 and
[1:05:33] so we heard him in my my uncles
[1:05:37] my mother anyone hurt and they're like
[1:05:39] this is the truth is this what we've
[1:05:40] been wanted to hear all our lives so he
[1:05:43] was just an Imagi list but there was
[1:05:45] such a spiritual connection there they
[1:05:47] asked him if he could please be our
[1:05:48] pastor and he's like no one evangelist
[1:05:51] told him to come can I be your past so
[1:05:53] no they just kept but they just kept on
[1:05:57] to him not to him to be our pastor so he
[1:06:00] finally said okay I'm gonna go and I'm
[1:06:02] gonna I'm gonna pray about I'm gonna
[1:06:03] fast and then we'll see what the Lord
[1:06:06] tells so it was like a two-week revival
[1:06:07] in the last day sure enough he said you
[1:06:10] went you went to us and told us okay I
[1:06:12] paid one more time and I guess I'll be
[1:06:14] your pastor and we were all so happy and
[1:06:17] you just we could not believe it and so
[1:06:20] he went to the to Lordsburg and that's
[1:06:24] when we first heard the message and
[1:06:25] that's when we got baptized we see the
[1:06:28] Holy Ghost we even we had a Christian
[1:06:30] school we made our own dresses and I was
[1:06:34] a choir leader it was just it was like a
[1:06:36] whirlwind it just everything happened
[1:06:38] just so fast the church was finished as
[1:06:40] a matter of fact later on it was named
[1:06:42] pyramid tabernacle from Buenavista
[1:06:44] Pentecostal church it was changed to
[1:06:47] pyramid tabernac and so then brother
[1:06:50] Jackson from Indiana over there Brown's
[1:06:52] friend he knew brother Mims and Jerry a
[1:06:54] Malone your brother man so whether
[1:06:57] Jackson came to our church and he had a
[1:06:59] he had a burden and brother Jerry a
[1:07:02] Malone also for the people in Mexico
[1:07:03] though they they just became very good
[1:07:06] friends and we started going to Indiana
[1:07:08] to visit and my mom would even go with
[1:07:11] other Jackson whoever could go to Mexico
[1:07:14] he would go to missionary over there and
[1:07:16] that's how we came became grounded in
[1:07:20] the message what year were you're
[1:07:23] baptized and you received the Holy Ghost
[1:07:25] that was the same time that was around
[1:07:28] 1968 1969 I don't know let's like around
[1:07:37] me to 12 and I was the same
[1:07:39] you accepted the message of fear yes
[1:07:41] okay all at the same time okay so what
[1:07:44] is it that keeps you going
[1:07:45] well when we became message believers it
[1:07:50] seemed like things hit us hard we went
[1:07:53] through so many trials I was kind of
[1:07:55] discouraging the word Christian school
[1:07:57] by their means have gone on to
[1:07:58] evangelize and I I just discouraging
[1:08:01] then so what happened I had a bad
[1:08:04] accident and I ended up in a coma and I
[1:08:08] the doctors told my mother that my blood
[1:08:10] pressure was dropping and it was up to
[1:08:12] me I had the will to live so my mom
[1:08:14] stayed beside me the whole time I was
[1:08:16] there like about a week or more and
[1:08:18] didn't a semi-coma
[1:08:20] and then I remember these brothers came
[1:08:22] to pray for me brother knee a customer
[1:08:25] then Mike Bennett and I remember them
[1:08:27] very important and something just
[1:08:29] stirred inside of me and then finally I
[1:08:31] just I just got up and sat up and I was
[1:08:34] fine and so you know I thank God for
[1:08:37] that and you know it just seemed like
[1:08:39] just Satan was somehow trying to maybe
[1:08:43] destroy what we added to destroy our
[1:08:46] faith but no God would always came on
[1:08:48] the scene and it made us stronger and
[1:08:51] made my mom stronger for there was for
[1:08:52] children so I just learned that you know
[1:08:55] all these things you just you just
[1:08:57] throws your faith and you just call me
[1:09:01] how do you maintain your relationship
[1:09:03] with the Lord and your brothers and
[1:09:05] sisters well I like every morning okay
[1:09:09] wake up and Horsham I listen to my music
[1:09:12] of Christian music and I just worship
[1:09:15] and my every passages of the Bible like
[1:09:18] I just stay focused and having
[1:09:20] in my mind all day he's like just there
[1:09:23] everywhere
[1:09:24] I think of him all day long of course my
[1:09:26] mother is well and my brother but it's
[1:09:28] all they're all like together so I think
[1:09:29] of them all together and I just keep my
[1:09:32] mind on him and even like town I pray
[1:09:36] constantly I couldn't pray for a good
[1:09:38] parking space and I always get it if
[1:09:41] whenever I seen you know and I God gives
[1:09:44] me songs and sometimes I I think wow
[1:09:47] this is probably for someone in and they
[1:09:49] sing and I just pray that it inspires
[1:09:51] someone or helps them in some way what
[1:09:55] is the key to life for you and the
[1:09:57] source of your success key of life is
[1:10:00] knowing that all good things come to
[1:10:02] them then you love the Lord and he's
[1:10:05] there everything that I know it's always
[1:10:08] been about him and just knowing that
[1:10:10] there's a promise and you have to keep
[1:10:12] your faith and believe really a kid life
[1:10:14] is believing hmm
[1:10:16] but maybe that you are his and he called
[1:10:19] you according to his purpose and and
[1:10:21] yours chosen one what what else can you
[1:10:25] ask for just what is your song favorite
[1:10:29] messenger for the brand
[1:10:30] oh my goodness tell em get one eat that
[1:10:40] and soon and then the English ones are
[1:10:43] amazing grace at the cross and sheltered
[1:10:46] in the arms of God
[1:10:48] and messes your brother Brennan a
[1:10:50] beautiful watchman what are the night
[1:10:53] and looking at the end having advice on
[1:10:57] being a Christian like that verse in
[1:11:00] Romans I believe what can separate us
[1:11:02] from the love of God and nothing should
[1:11:05] separate you from the love of God no
[1:11:08] matter what amount of trials you get
[1:11:10] distracted but always remember that God
[1:11:13] loves you and you are his to stay
[1:11:16] faithful and I believe okay and the
[1:11:21] lesson is when you met brother Tommy and
