[42:59] one thing the judges you will be are not
[43:01] acceptable the DMV and that's God's Word
[43:05] we cannot stand before God that I am of
[43:11] a certain church they usually do not get
[43:14] that unless you God doesn't look for
[43:17] brands a certain Church the only thing
[43:22] that God looks for lo que busca EOS is
[43:25] red tag of a blood of Jesus Christ
[43:29] there's no matter the Sangre de que su
[43:32] Chris God did not come to say churches
[43:35] Johanna but unless you came to say
[43:38] individuals individuals we are not like
[43:47] the nation of Israel possible on a
[43:50] Sunday given here
[43:51] Israel is same as ignition Israeli
[43:54] Islamic community on and we will
[43:56] get into that as we proceed with our
[43:58] stamina Misawa stress to you I would
[44:02] like to call your attention again to
[44:04] Matthew 24:12 the man was not this joint
[44:07] mobility but Wilson here 24 children
[44:13] Mateo painting but Jesus is speaking
[44:16] about six seals of Nagas ratios if suit
[44:20] he never spoke about the seven silver
[44:23] safety when he spoke about 1600 s ratio
[44:28] and is telling us all these things that
[44:31] will happen in the end time no the
[44:33] goddess close enough in the serpentine
[44:35] and we see them around us you know the
[44:39] most part the door the vosotros we see
[44:41] all these things that have come upon the
[44:44] religious world you can put as possible
[44:46] and already use pristine State in church
[44:49] get together the best cloud in the
[44:51] distance we see the rise in a false
[44:54] Christ be my little puppets level of
[44:57] impetus Christos affect us we see many
[45:00] things that seems to be God is nothing
[45:03] but full strong wherever father Perez de
[45:06] Oro masses por dos locos but we because
[45:09] we live in a world of contrast but if an
[45:12] accomplice
[45:13] they take a bad moment to show
