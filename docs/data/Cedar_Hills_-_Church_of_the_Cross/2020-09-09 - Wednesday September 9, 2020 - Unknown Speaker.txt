i believe from our sister rachel [Music] i was in prison locked up in chains said help me captive to sorrow and pain years of frustration as love passed me by until the master heard my [Music]

lord we thank you for that lord jesus if we can all please stand coming into the best part of the service to be able to hear from god himself through the mouthpiece of our brother jerry de lau i'm excited i can't wait to hear what he has in store for me tonight let's sing that song and i don't know about you but that's my prayer i just want to be submerged by him that's a little too low for me brother will or maybe a little higher [Music] [Music] oh [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] know [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] foreign [Music] [Music] is [Music] amen god bless you this evening the pleasure this evening to address the bride of christ i don't want to say throw this together quickly but i had to put it together quickly but god is good amen amen as long as we're obedient to his word god when we realize that it's not us but that it's him it's not my words my words will fail but god's words god's word will never fail us just uh we won't have you standing too long if we can just open our bibles to first peter 1 13. pedro uno dresa and it reads wherefore gird up the loins of your mind be sober and hope to the end for the grace that is to be brought unto you at the revelation of jesus christ and also if we go to first peter 5 starting with verse 8 pedro cinco and it reads be sober be vigilant because your adversary the devil as a roaring lion amen may the lord add the blessing to the remnants word and you may be seated so we see in in in these first two scriptures number one it says gird up the loins of your mind that might sound kind of strange right because normally when you say gird up your loins you want you want to put a belt around your waist but here he's saying gird up the loins of your mind especially in these last days but but both of them have the word sober so so so when we think of the word sober we go to uh like i used to do a lot of i used to drink a lot and i guarantee you i wasn't sober but being sober you want to be in your right of that same scripture first peter 1 13. yes therefore with their minds that are alert and fully sober and then there's another version that i read and it says therefore prepare your minds for action so in other words we're preparing for a battle estamos preparanta right that's correct let me read this quote from brother branham the greatest battle ever fought and he says i believe that the greatest battle that was ever fought is [Applause] you know the bible says gird up the lines of your mind [Music] um and this phrase girl up the loins yes yes comes from the greek word forgive me if i don't pronounce and write but it says what it's referring to it's it's the oriental's back in the day they were dressed in long robes they had to lift up the ropes they had to get the loose ends and tuck them into their waist so when they would run korean it was in track and field and different running events so we're in a race right now we're in a battle right now and we've got to have our minds clear we can't have any hindrances that that that is clogging our minds brother branham says we've got to keep the channel free it is then you can't get the word of god inside of it right can i name a few algunos that's a hindrance yes it's a hindrance yes it impedes me from what i need to get done and if doubt doesn't line up with god's word then we gotta get rid of it because doubt is gonna come in when i got sick with the virus it was it was pretty rough and um the first few days los primeros diaz i was up and down estaba um but there was three days that i was at my weakest guest i didn't want to do nothing i wanted to sleep i pretty much slept day and night i couldn't eat i was at my weakest and the devil comes to me and he he tries to give me a loose end and he says i thought the lord was going to take care of you look at your condition look at what he i went with this for three days because it wasn't just a physical battle it turned into a spiritual battle and he attacked me at my weakest and finally the second or third day and i said devil your your words do not line up with god's word because whether i'm in this condition the bible says in isaiah yes by his stripes we are already healed so no matter what you say out of your mind eve and he disarmed her when she started to reason with god's word right we want a question and we want to why this why say you plant the seed of faith because faith is a seed [Music] and you got to plant it you but if our mind is all clogged because what's one of the worst inventions ever made and maybe it didn't look right what they were doing no and in that day i hope i've had my mind clear yes i've had my channel open my canal to to to have god's word the seed of god's word because the greatest battle ever fought is going on and satan chose the mind he chose the mind why probably because you have ears you know i i i always uh when i go to work i have the radio on my i love sports so i'm listening to sports radio yo alma los de portes esta estoy but i find out when you're listening to to different things like that whether it be news whether it be radio csl radio whether it be christian music yes musica cristiana whether it be worldly music music there's always something that sticks with you and that's the last thing you hear yes pretty soon there's no difference between you and them because you're talking like them every day of the week we gotta keep our minds filled with this word because when you fight your enemy you gotta know your enemies and you gotta know your enemy is out to destroy utterly just destroy then you will have the tools to fight in this battle because when you go out to fight in a war you have weapons you have protection and god wants to disarm you of your protection you have no protection but you can't just fill it up with junk but you can't just fill it up with junk no you can't just watch tv all day television you can't just deal with the world all day young people i don't know if you have trouble with this but you can't listen to worldly music all day long no no no uh don't do god's word keep your mind in your heart you're gonna need these weapons brother branham he he speaks hermano brandise and he says you have your five yes senses and he says they're all they're they're all right but he says but don't trust him unless they agree with god's word so you have all these senses these hearings the smell the see but what if what you see doesn't line up with god's word he says you gotta get rid of it if what you're hearing doesn't line up with god then you gotta get rid of it so we gotta gird up the loins of our mind this evening to hear what you're not supposed to hear but to hear god's word brother branham also says now you have imaginations you have a conscience unconsensual you have memories memoria reasons and affections affection they're all right if they agree with the word whatever disagrees with god's word get rid of it don't hang on to it because the scripture says straight is when you get in there when you're walking through you can't have all the garbage hanging on you can't have all this baggage hanging on that's where the sword of the spirit comes in and he's got to cut that garbage he's got to cut the doubt off he's got to cut the unbelief off he's got a cut talking about your brother and your sister off he's got a cut talking about the pastor in the ministry because we don't keep our baggage and make the gate fit us uh but then you bring all that garbage inside with you so if we want to be successful in our spiritual life and truly walk with god that we must start dealing with the loins of our mind in other words we must seek to deal with all the loose ends in our thinking that haven't yet been been submitted to the word of god are surrendered to the holy spirit's power if we deliberately see uh if we deliberately allow wrong thinking game and wrong thing and wrong believing to continue in our lives that'll be the biggest mistake ever you know how many how many has come into a situation in their lives whether something happens i'll deal with it another day yeah the next day comes oh i'll leave it there i'll deal with it later before you know it you haven't dealt with it [Music] almost and it started off as a little pile next thing it's a big old mess from the beginning because fighting the battle is not how long you can make the battle okay but it's to put a stop to it right then and there yes don't make the battle longer than it has you can't ask for something and live any kind of life you want to promote but don't disbelieve god's word this evening but know this because god's word is true god's word will keep you la palabras i can read john 10 10 1 the sds the thief cometh not before to steal and to kill and to destroy el dorado but not just life and it says that they that they might have it more abundantly he doesn't just want to give you life he wants to give it to you more abundantly because a thief is going to come to your mind and he's going to try and steal he's going to try and rob you and take you away from god's word and he's going to try and bluff his way into your inside of your heart [Applause] in closing i just i i would like to say this but that didn't end right there he says i didn't get you but i'm gonna try and take somebody close to you and he attacked because i stand on god's word and he know i know what he can do if i just believe and i saw my mom today it was pretty hard yeah because you had to stand outside the window for me that was pretty tough but she called me later and she says i spoke to the doctor my kidneys are perfectly fine i don't know they don't have me on dialysis and dialysis my foot is healing really well said i have to do one more skin but i will be out september 24th that's what my god does god and god bless you [Music] amen that's what our god does ask and you shall receive that is beautiful over over a month in the hospital [Music] no demon is too big for my god there is nothing too small for him either glory that blood amen if we could all please stand and sing that song that's another will let's sing the blood that jesus said for [Music] me [Music] for me [Music] all the blood [Music] it will never lose [Music] is [Music] [Applause] [Music] is in the blood that gives me strength it will never [Music] is [Music] all mighty [Music] [Music] is and it flows all the blood that is [Music] is [Music] [Music] is [Music] foreign [Music] one more time [Music]
