worship we thank you lord in jesus name amen amen how many is happy to be in the house of the lord i know that it was hyped up a bit but you need to lower those expectations a little bit actually i'll i'm going to turn that around you know it's is the minister can prepare el ministro but you know it's it's actually it's now on you're you're you've got to do the work and you've got to pull depending we don't just come and just sit down to be served tonight it's on you to pull from the lord from the interpreter from the lord what you have need of tonight there is a confidence and it says i'm not leaving until i get something because then the lord says you're just a vessel i'm going to get them what they have needed somebody believes that it really really believes that how many would you say in your heart can you do that this evening i promise you according to the word it's the lord's promise you're going to leave with exactly what you have needed amen and if we just keep that in our minds it's good to be here with you i've kept you standing a little bit i feel well i really just feel welcome and you know i kind of feel like brother branham said for the caleb like i could just come in and put my feet up get into the ice box and i really do feel that way at home and i appreciate that you know it's messy it's it's uh it's um it's not a building that makes you feel welcome but it's the spirit of the people i want to thank you this evening for just a wonderful day that i've had with you all just a tremendous tremendous word and you know when the devil comes in you know the bible says the devil when he comes in like a flood that the lord is going to raise up a standard what i love about the bible is that it's not just one time so the devil he continues to come in like a flood right and every day or every week it seems worse and worse and worse but yet the lord used to raise the standard above where the devil is coming in that was a tremendous word to us two three years ago now the lord is raising you up because that's where we need to be amen and that's how this word is an eternal word but you could read a scripture oh i know i know all about appreciate the specials and the song leading in the musicians first class just number one how many appreciate your music department and your worship department amen amen let's read ezekiel chapter 9. and um i didn't well i actually didn't even know to maybe just a little while ago what i thought i would would talk about and i had an i had a note written down i happened to look at that note this afternoon and it had a definition of a word on it that definition happened to match exactly the definition read this morning start with verse one he cried also in mine ears with a loud voice saying cause them to have charge over the city to draw near even every man with his destroying weapon in his hand and behold six men came from the way of the higher gate which lies towards the north and every man a slaughter weapon in his hand and one man among them was clothed with linen with a writer's ink horn by his side and they went in and stood beside the brazen altar and the glory of the of the god of israel was gone up from the cherub whereupon he was to the threshold of the house and he called to the man clothed with linen which had the writer's ink horn by his side is this is a scripture i think we probably are familiar with at least a portion of it and the lord said unto him go through the midst of the city through the midst of jerusalem and set a mark upon the foreheads of the men that sigh and that cry for all the abominations that be done in the midst thereof foreign a lot of ways you could take this scripture and talk about it but but maybe we'll just go down a certain path this morning okay if i just stay real simple real easy probably something that you know already sometimes we know so much and and you know the the word will say what are you doing as we heard this morning with what you already know uh you know and this this is talking about a mark put upon a people established or really a a type of person and we know if you if you if you study in in the message in the word the purpose that god has set them to do yes and that purpose is to sigh and decry for the abominations that are done now what is that what does that mean you know i i have heard just through my life a lot of different definitions of that phrase different definition and the one that always what i was told most commonly it didn't have a good ring to me it was almost that you saw that sin was being done and the attitude was that you look kind of looked down upon them that there was a person that maybe was was not living right yeah in in that you kind of turned up your nose a little bit at it well you know and the bible gives an example of this when there's two men that go to the temple to pray and one of them is praying lord you know what i said you give me i'm a and i want to tell you let's get all this that is not sighing and crying for the sin that is done that that you know certainly anybody that that the lord has saved or delivered you want every single person that means you want it for joe biden or donald trump i don't care what they've said lokiandicho now i can say i don't agree with that well that's it that doesn't line up in the bible i don't know if that's right but my attitude towards them it doesn't say anything about them no this is not about the age it says something about me and and i want you to know that the bible says and it's not it's not being comfortable in in your home church no although that day for your household it's good that you keep your household sanctified what happens in the neighbor's house happens in your house but if we have the real real spirit of christ it's the name of the spirit of the critic concerned with what's happening in my neighbor's house because i want him to be saved i want him to know the savior that i know i was him [Music] had enough spirit of christ to sufficient and that's how the lord works did you know that that is how the lord works why would he want you and i used to be praying for somebody else he could just reach out to himself can god do whatever he wants to no puerto rico i'm telling you this is so basic it probably doesn't get more basic my whole life that someone else needs that same thing amen amen now i know it's hard yosek is defeated i know it's hard jose question to concentrate on someone else right now you could say i don't know about that brother well it's here and you know you would be just fine but let's go to the bible and let's go to the word and see if we can we can find that you know i i think they have a couple of uh quotes do you mind if we read a quote that's gonna see everybody still all right yeah you're so glad you came on time to tell you how you should live no this where should come over i i still say this i think every pulpit should just have a big mirror like brother caleb said you were beat up before you got here that's how the holy spirit works let's go to that first quote if you don't mind i think they have that sister brother do you know the bible just said for the holy ghost to mark those who sigh and cry for the abominations did in the city i want to ask you a question i'm sorry go ahead hermana you forgive me i'm not i'm not accustomed to an interpreter anymore so now i want to ask you a question we make so much motion over our religious ideas now listen he's not even talking about the other things you pray for praying for the sins of the city but according to the scriptures the angel of god was only to seal those who sighed and cried for the abomination we're not interested no more we want to know that we can have a little society in our church we want to know that we got a vote coming when it comes time to elect the next pastor okay [Music] but that's good old-fashioned castor oil i assume that's kind of like pulling teeth maybe for our time we ought to be on our knees crying for the sin and the abomination grace that's done in the city so we have the greatest congregation sunday domingo all stay home sunday night look at the television well we didn't do that tonight didn't do that tonight now listen are you still are you still happy let's go over to ephesians 2. that's real now that that's real cutting all right thank the lord that he just starts to go to chopping on us in and you uh we'll start with verse one you have he quickened who were dead in trespasses and sins that's good how many can say you know i don't know if i belong in that group how many could say i was dead in trespasses now let's be careful all right we don't act like we don't belong in that scripture we see sin going on nothing but a sinner kids let's let's just keep reading here wearing in time past ye walked so even if i don't like to put myself in that first scripture he's going to put me in there for me according to the course of this world god will sometimes keep that a secret from you so you don't know which one has that nostalgia so that you will show the spirit of christ amen amen among whom also we had our conversation in times past in the lusts of our flesh that's a that's a mirror of the of god's word this is who you were it is this is who i was looking at no longer that person is a person but he's bringing into your remembrance for a purpose now but god who is rich in mercy we could just stop right there who is rich in mercy yesterday where in for his great love wherewith he loved us when did he love you when you were dead in sin and hath raised us up together and made us sit together in heavenly places in christ jesus christ that in the ages to come he might show the exceeding i love this now all right god is rich in mercy amen is exceedingly rich the scripture isn't just there accidentally the exceeding riches of his grace in his kindness towards us through christ jesus requested because you sighed and cried for yourself because he knew they would do exactly what he would do i want to talk about that i i don't know if i'll have time for that i want to talk about those ages or had a hard time with by not continuing in perfect love for no continuation amen amen he says the corinthian church but just the church he said you you want to go after signs and you want to go after speaking in tongues and i can't martin's age martin luther king he said it didn't it didn't surprise him he could stand with against the catholic church it is surprising that he could keep his head above the fanaticism that followed every age had a spirit that was meant for that age that got them through that age okay what made the lesson it was different no we didn't have to be uh we didn't have to go through and be a martyr they had a spirit for that age that allowed and and what what the lord is trying to get to us in this scripture is that now in this age our our church age now i want to ask you when is the last what is the last day when is this last church age happening in this church age we have all things combined together so where they had a portion of the word in another age oh the word in this age they had a weakness for their age every weakness we have every weakness in this age but we have every single strength that has ever existed in this age is you have you you have i'm talking to you the last church age now i have london every failure how many feel that one how many feel like sometimes there isn't one thing i won't fail sometimes we fail god by the minute it seems like oh i did that yesterday did that an hour ago sometimes it's just our thoughts but you'll start to have a victory every minute of the day nobody can think back to the last time they had a victory is you know and he's talking about in the ages to come now jesus faced all those things he faced all those things but in one person but a persona and what he wanted to do the same thing all things are going to be in one body one worldwide body governed by the same spirit that dwelled in him i hope we believe that because if not we're i told you that i'd get to this and i started to think about this subject and i was listening to a message called the message of grace he says you and i usted killed his son we killed the son of god you see him hanging on the cross he says we hung him up there love if that doesn't get you excited then you have forgotten what he has done because we killed his son and he justly could have sent us to hello and in this message what i wanted to get to is this exceeding riches of his grace i started to think about the message brother branham preached when divine love is projected grace takes his place he preaches it several times such a good message excuse me i'd put that on your your i'm just going to give you recommendations brother caleb if you haven't heard it go back and hear though but the beautiful part is that he's giving you an opportunity to do what he's done and i thought about this can i read you the definition of sovereignty supreme power rank i love this definition i hope that you love it unlimited in extent oh brother i know somebody but they're just too far gone to be safe not for the grace of god no no no not for the grace of god and who it can accentuate you know i used to if i could just be a little bit honest with you never i never really i just didn't like the what i thought about it let me explain before they they got real quiet they had explico what i thought it was is that god is going to have grace and he'll do it on who he feels like having grace scriptures in the bible that talk about disgrace that we do not continue in sin that grace may abound yeah and i would just pray lord have grace yes the lord lord may you have grace on this senor may you have grace on this but that's not what the word is talking about you do have us the ability to have love you know that right you can have love on anyone you choose to have love and what it does is exactly what the prophet said it does exactly that that divine love amor di vino now listen oh that's good you could say brother i don't know if my love is divine and see how long that lasts with your your carnal love but try loving a sinner i want to read a quote i hope lord willing in a minute just cuts right to the bone you have been given as believers the ability to aim the sovereign grace of god that now if you don't have character that's a power we don't belong that's right it's not a it's a power we don't belong to wielding as we heard this morning let's read that if you have that quote i know it let's just read this this is talking about now you you think i can't have that brother i don't know if i can have that kind of love you know what the second time this this is talking about that that colored woman in in memphis his plane got landed and he started going for a walk he says at the end of this sovereign grace isn't just out there doing what it feels like directed by divine love this is i want to talk about this sovereignty a little bit you know you know that god has a law god wrote laws you know that sovereign grace gracious he doesn't have to follow us did you know that you know that sovereign grace can do whatever it wants god can write a law and says brother tommy if you do this but you're going to die it doesn't have to follow that law because it's above the law sovereignty now god can say this is going to happen this can happen he set the law but then he created or then he had his own yes and i'll read it from you from the from the quote he needs it to be directed let's let's go to the next one the second time if there's a next there we go you know god so loved the world you people here tonight we're familiar with this have you ever seen people you just want to be around it's the atmosphere they create around them other others nice people that you can't you can't stand to be around i hope nobody came to your mind right now if they if they did you should go talk to them and ask some forgiveness and maybe tell them a little bit about it i just throw that in there to be a little bit light when love has been projected this is cut off does it say that it's time time for sovereign grace to step in we'll do it every time no because if somebody is being obedient to that spirit brother must say i always start off with praying for myself yes oh lord i'm this kind of person i'm sorry for this you forgive me and god he's saying now brother braham says now someone else will pray for you alignment he's going to use somebody listen who's no better than i am to give me the gift of sovereign grace no better than anybody to direct i think there's another one divine love is projected resulting in sovereign grace taking its place divine love can only go so far no i don't have the ability to have sovereign grace i have the ability to have love for somebody but when it is held to the end uh this is not this is not my word no it's me this is the lord god it's through a mouthpiece saying that is not what the church needs that's what the church needs looking this is not a new organization it needs the baptism of love race it's that scripture sign and crime i have a meaning to us such a meaning to us let me ask you this what is your salvation only they will not be worried about making it there no yeah they will be praying for somebody else now brother that's hard to do easy to say but it's hard to get down but and not worry about yourself which is exactly why god put it in it that's exactly why he put it in there because it goes against our nature this question you get about half of the hands go up he says you know that if you don't feel like you have the holy spirit you should still raise your hand because you're not gonna get it unless you have faith and claim that you have the holy spirit for getting a faith that's the basic bible have you received the holy ghost how many here have the holy spirit now may god honor your faith and produce the results of the holy spirit same thing that it did back there divine love yeah you know there's never been a gun briefly that's killed anything it only aims the bullet and we aim where the sovereign grace of god is that is a big responsibility and and i just want to i'll just close with this i think by doing that you say brother the true believer is going to do this i think when you do and that's what the believer will have is the spirit of christ i'll leave you with exactly the same thing he said don't pray for yourself pray for somebody else to get the strength to know who they are and i'm telling you this goes so beyond the way that i would do it because christ and and i just want to encourage you to do the same thing and watch what takes place in your life things that you you didn't even bendigo [Applause] the lord what a beautiful message glory can we give one to god servant tonight thank you brother ryan for surrendering yourself to the lord tonight i know i was blessed were you blessed tonight glory hallelujah don't you love him church just worship him
