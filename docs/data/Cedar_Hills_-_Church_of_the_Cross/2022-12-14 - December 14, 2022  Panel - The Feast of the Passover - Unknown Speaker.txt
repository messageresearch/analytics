Africa along these lines but Africa and it was about seven uh it was what we're going to start on tonight is the seventh Beast of Israel or the seven Jewish feasts and uh it uh we I think it might have taken us about 10 hours to do it there's no way we can do it justice tonight we're going to do an overview a little overview first of all and then uh we'll we'll uh then we're going to focus tonight on the Feast of the Passover and uh and then from there we'll we'll have the other panelists that will be taking on uh the unleavened bread the first fruits yes foreign [Music] [Music] it says and the Lord spake unto Moses saying speaking to the children of Israel Israel and say unto them concerning the Feast of the Lord which he shall Proclaim to be holy convocations even these are my feasts is six days shall be shall work be done but the seventh day is the Sabbath of rest and holy convocation you shall do no work therein it is the Sabbath of the Lord in all your dwellings [Music] these are the feasts of the Lord verse 4 even holy convocations which he shall Proclaim in their seasons in verse 5 in the 14th day of the of the first month and even is the Lord's Passover and so so we we're going right away into and I do want to uh Brethren is is uh is is what what a topic that that our pastor has chosen for for for for us and for the rest of the panelists in trundle in Minnesota so much here okay brother brother brother Ron the Passover means what to to to us as believers well first of all brother Tommy momentum on the Tom as you read a minute ago it was the second the the Passover the sacrifice was killed on the 14th day now it might not be you know the month of abib as when this sacrifice was was killed well I don't think it's a coincidence that today is December 14th is when the Passover was killed and we're speaking about the password you know what what this what this Passover was uh Naturally Speaking naturally so naturally speaking and I'm sure most of us have read the scriptures but but for those who haven't uh what what this was uh what is celebrated was when God spared the the lives of the firstborn children of of Israel Las Vegas when the death angel passed and those those of homes those households that had the blood on the lintel the doorposts the death angel would pass over them that simply is but it is is in itself if you look at the word is to pass over but it is brother brother Ronnie started with with the the of the death angel this is something that is of vital importance continue in our in our time today and so go go ahead I'm sorry we're we're let's go back and forth no no as there's a scripture that our that our pastor he he references uh quite often reference and we'll all you know we all know it that Hell hath enlarged her mouth you know and I don't think it's a coincidence that at this time right here this day and age that we live in is that naturally speaking because we're still on on the on on the topic of of uh of um modern events right now I don't think it's a coincidence that the United States had just made a trade by the time no crocus coincidence for a basketball player you know they traded for a man whose nickname is The Merchant of death so we see this man as responsible for for Much Death Naturally Speaking responsible he's probably in this modern day is more responsible for more deaths than any one single person in particular is responsible Persona in particular so his big old arms dealer isn't a great big arms dealer I don't know how many have have read on it but he's [Music] ammunition he um had his hand in many uh if not all of recent Wars you know and I don't think it's a coincidence that it was a trade there was a simultaneous freeing [Music] um you have death and all its attributes Jesus attributos brother Jim this shows you what people value today entertainment entertainment you you take a marine there big Hollywood stars were even upset at this Hollywood because I can't remember the Marine's name but he's been in prison for four years and instead of bringing him who fought for his country they freed a person of the lowest morale character that you could speak of yeah because they're a famous basketball player uh all the modern ideas of of society today they value it more that female basketball player is nothing wrong with other women playing basketball I'm not speaking against that but anyway but they put more value on that than they did on a man that has put his life on the line for this nation I would like to ask brother Isaiah real quick we're talked about to put the blood on the dental and the post of the house once the lamb was slain what does the dental the post represent in The Believer yes uh so to the believer that's the heart El Corazon the Passover meant it means in a in a very broad terminal movie it was the shadow of things to come remember that that uh that the Old Testaments it's typed in Shadows of the new son Depot and so so what what what the the Passover was the feast what was the the shadow of it was what he was going to do on Calvary La Sombra ERA this is what why Calvary is so important to us it's because we know what he did on Calvary for us but we go down the line I want you to notice one thing is that the lamb that was slain on Calvary was not our lamb it was God's land the Lamb of God that's why that's why when when when the Prophet The Prophet that came in the spirit and power of Elijah that's why we believe in Elijah yes the the spirit of Elijah he was the one that had the revelation behold the lamb of God that taketh away the sin of the world this was the only thing that would satisfy God so then we understand in hearing our pastor our founding pastor pastor and here in our pastor yes that Jesus Paid the ultimate sacrifice or Redemption but each and every one of us also pay a price to bring Redemption to God's people so that's why I don't want you to forget on the first part of the Passover was God's land that would take away the sin of the world how many this lamb how many days did they have to keep this land okay they're gonna sacrifice what was the preparation even for the land preparation before I get to that brother I want everyone to notice this that this Feast of the Passover is it was one day era signifying that Jesus Christ the ultimate sacrifice will die one time significance you didn't have to keep on dying over and over here the Feast of the unleavened bread it's it's unleavened bread for seven days you know it is by one offering but it's perfected them that are Sanctified by the time Uno frienda Perfection now you go into the requirements first of all a lamb had to be picked doubt on the 10th day is why why the 10th day because the family had to pick out a lamb La Familia um lamb should be without blemish and that's exactly right just how Jesus Christ was the perfect sinless sacrifice for our sins a land that knew no sin took Upon Our Time okay so the slam had to be picked out on the 10th day is brother Isaiah said they had to be have no blemish it was sacrificed on the 14th day yeah and that's what these 10 days were to to look over the lamb to make sure that there was no blemish they had to live with the little so they had to live with the lamb and they had to I remember our pastor and I believe in the in the in the parallels he says that they had to build a relationship with it it had to when they were sacrificed it had to hurt them it had to hurt them you have to identify with the Lambs now now once once it was it was sacrificed now the other requirement was it had to eat all the Lambs brother Jim so what would happen if if a family was too small to eat the whole lamb family it's like by the time you said if you read the rest rest of the chapter it said in Exodus 12. they didn't have enough people to eat all the Lambs they're neighbors because all of the Lamb had to be eaten showing you and me it reminds me of a message that brother Branham preached called the token he makes this statement different but basically he says full obedience assist declaration to the full word entitles you to the tokenya now right now we'll get into a little bit more why the blood was a token and what it means you couldn't leave not the intestines nothing that had to all be eaten that's why we have invited neighbors here aren't we neighbors love thy neighbor as thyself because we must eat all of the words what you're trying to tell all of us is that the full word of God came to us we eat all of it that's right because until the whole word of God came to obey something you had no access to yet so brother Jim what you're telling me is you're referring to the scripture where it says take the book the book eat the book the whole book what's going to happen when you eat the books be sweet in your mouth and bitter in your belly yeah yeah and what a coincidence that that one of the other requirements for for the the sacrifice brother Jimmy The Coincidence was that it had to be cooked with bitter herbs bitter herbs okay Americas so now then it also had to be now now this was now that was the requirements for the lamb now there's now there's a requirements also brother Tom of of the person that's going to be eating the lamb tell us about it well because they left the land of Egypt and haste is there when they ate the the Passover they had to be they had their loins girded now they had to eat it with their shoes on they were prepared and staff in hand in Manu and it had to be eaten yes what do you have on on that for us right there brother Jim well the reason they had to eat it in haste it's not so much that they were in a hurry the dead angel had passed the call had come how many know what Israel was called when they were in Egypt what is the people of God El Pueblo de dios when God called them out of Egypt into the desert of wilderness then what did he call it the church the Iglesia so what does the word church mean everybody everybody the word church the significance are you happy this was not a guesswork it wasn't they were going to have another opportunity they had to leave when God called them through the mouth of the Prophet Moses in the first Exodus that's why they left with a sense of urgency and haste because it was a life or death situation brother Jimmy and the message does not brother Branham say that uh Rebecca who was blood relation to Isaac she had to make her decision quick decision absolutely absolutely because God's servant with their Eliezer because had the Commandment or commission from Abraham to find a bride for his son Isaac one little thing a couple little things different about the Exodus then as they left in haste and The Exodus how many of you know we're in an exodus how many Exodus you know to those somebody raise the oh yeah raise it high brother you know those three Tres amen the first Exodus is when Noah went into the ark yeah [Music] he fully obeyed one man fully obeyed what God told him he got his family in the arka and then the Judgment spell the second Exodus is they came out which is what we're talking about now out of egyptus the type of the World Systems today it's a type of Cosmos the world order Los Cosmos world order they were the greatest nation of the time and what was the problem with Israel in general when how many million left 2 million many people had come out of Egypt many people had come out of Egypt but Egypt had not come out of them so so brother Jimmy Jimmy so so what you're telling me is that that it didn't fully come out of them because they didn't eat the whole books no they literally did when they came from a state of justification when they came out and were baptized Under the Red Sea and under the cloudification that was justification but what did the Wilderness representative anybody it resent represents sanctification and during this time God fed them bread from heaven right what was that that bread called yes I don't want to get into that but it was a light bread it didn't satisfy them and the thing about it you had to eat it the day that it fell from heaven Fresco if you left it to the next day it was warming and what does that tell you and me when God reveals something for us to take and eat we must do it when God brings down the Manna is we might try to do something about it two weeks later a month later how many of us have done that and realized you know what that didn't work effective so they said we would rather go back to Egypt because even though we were slaves we ate garlic and onions cucumbers cucumbers you know cucumbers is okay with salad but you know besides that you know the Pinos they would rather go back and eat that than to eat what God was supplying for them Angels food yeah Angels food and they were still they as our pastor I preached many times they still had the mentality brother brother Isaiah Isaiah they they would they would back to they would take the blood and brother Jimmy asked you the question they would put it upon the lintel of the doorpost what does that represent today and you said their heart your heart if if that blood was not was not placed upon the lintel of the doorposts who did it again did it affect the whole family or was there a particular person that it affected in particular um I believe it was okay uh the firstborn so this is this this this comes into into a into a into a sense of of uh of then brother brother Isaiah a desperation is still in in trouble because to the to the majority of people uh we we we we we uh are very are very uh happy to to know the the word of God and and we we we know about what God's word comes to do for us is but there is a direct effect that it happens to us being that we all belong to the Church of the firstborn now now the now the firstborn was going to die if that blood's not applied and so it is a vital importance it is importante so that we would know that even in our own lives and in our own homes to know that the blood is there or not when your life is on the line you better know if it's there honest you know that that's where mama and daddy can't get you out it's a personal effect between you and God as soon as the firstborn had to go and check because until he himself saw the dead put the blood on the lintel of the doors that Death Angel could not pass over them each person in particular person with the message that has been given to us an adulterated word of God a leading word of God and when that lamb is bleeding make sure that it is applied in your life you will die we will die I was asked here to correct something go ahead yes sir the first Exodus was Noah going into the ark foreign what condition are you on you're coming from one spiritual condition into another spiritual baptism of the Holy Ghost and then the third from the baptism of the Holy Ghost right back into the Millennium for the great hereafter okay let me go back again yes please repeat to us the first Exodus is Israel coming out of egyptus is but my natural land to another natural land the next is we're coming up from one spiritual condition spiritual to another spiritual baptism of the Holy Ghost now remember that actually the token is but then from the baptism of the Holy Ghost that is to go right back into the Millennium and the Daniel here that's right that's what he said yes sir you can't skip one and put one into place of the other that's right or you'll never get to the Great Millennium and the great hereafter so so we so brother Jim what you're telling me is that is is that or what we've been reading here it's it's been history but we can't leave it as history right now I want the people to notice this thing about the feast even though we're just hitting the first one because we're not really going to get into the prophetic part of what it means to Israel so much at least tonight but what we want to see is how it is applies to us but one thing I see about this feast in general all of these pieces cover yesterday boy and forever so God's College not only for us to see that Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever but for Israel to see the same thing truly when this same message that we believe today is revealed to them they will see the Christ of yesterday first and then there'll be two prophets the other day show them Jesus Christ in the present tense and they'll know what their inheritance is it is they will realize that they rejected the Messiah when they rejected Jesus Christ they'll look back and see the Christ that they crucified tell us what my Papa said today what did he say today you're the one that's telling us that the opposite is okay oh he he said I was listening to a message and entitled The headship of Christ the the Third Exodus and he said this statement if this is the statement you're after Jesus he said God will let you air dios yeah people would choke on that right he actually read a scripture I believe out of Isaiah he says God will let you air so that he can show you what tribe you pertain to he goes today people people don't know where they belong today per se as like Israel we are a tribe and he makes the statement God never went over and hung around with Benjamin all the time and and his inheritance God knew his place Benjamin knew his place God God Ibraham knew his place what tribe they were and what many of us have aired why many of us because we don't know what tribe we belong to foreign Papa talk to us brother Ryan I've done this let me run My Brother Jimmy's so awesome I want him to continue you're awesome so so brother Jim no no Jim so referencing our founding Pastor right he says what was the problem with the little lamb in the first Covenant it was a substitute but the life couldn't return but here he says if I see Yo personal pronoun go away I your personal pronoun will return again to you that's the promise of the holy spirit is to return back regressar to the worshiper yeah this this this is what what when we come into it's more than than just coming into what we know as as Easter and Jesus came and he died for us and and we're coming to church and then we we might live the same life that we lived in last year you know until that the the the Revelation comes to us what he did foreign when we see if you ever see The Passion of the Christ have you ever anybody ever seen this is did you ever did you get upset when you first saw it I did you'll see and that was only uh two and a half three hours so those guys but but in real life it was over 18 hours of what he did for you did for me this should cause ourselves to surrender that much more to him because it was it's not as as our Pastor said and brother Jim says to bring to bring it to to today how does it function today unless he lives inside of our hearts tell help tell them real quickly what God did for you you don't have to go into details what did God do you say uh well first off I just want to say just to kind of just bear with me here because I'm up here with these and I'm still in rookie mode tell us what he did for you so uh just a little something here so we're talking about the Passover and like we had said before we know that that these people they took a lamb and the lamb wasn't supposed to have any blemish and we knew that they were going to kill it in the evening time and with that blood they were going to put it on the toll on the doorposts uh so we know that if if the blood was there on the doorpost in the lentilation that the death angel was gonna pass over remember we're talking about the Passover so um I feel like that the thing here is that I that God sent or he sent signs and wonders to these people in Egypt and to pharaoh and the people yeah but I don't believe that they picked up these signs that God was sending them I mean they were you know they even were trying to pretty much whatever Moses was saying the prophet that God had sent them it almost kind of just like went through one ear and out the other and so I feel like God kind of was like oh you know you guys understand you need these signs and you're just kind of just flat out ignoring it so I feel like at that time God was gonna cause a separation from those who believed in those who didn't and that was the the whole thing about with applying the blood yes uh what did God do for you what has he done that that is so very important when you when you when you really come to the nitty-gritty of where you were at and where you're at now what did you what did Jesus don't understand uh while I used to be I used to be uh antis I was out you know before you know before I was baptized you know you know I was out there doing things I shouldn't have been doing I was saying things here things I shouldn't have yeah and you know when I had that that experience with the Lord and when I gave my heart to him uh you know after that that's when I just really started to dig deep you know and just kind of really listen to the messages so then I feel like that's when God had taken me out he had taken me out of out of the worst condition that I was in in my life out of Egypt that that is so a vital importance with what he just got through saying you know I started digging deep I believe that that this year is going to be a year to dig deep we've already done a lot of things shallow-wise we've done I've done a lot of things shallow-wise we do a lot of things but just on the top and there's ripples on the water but how many people have really dug down to see who exactly you really are yeah that has really done for you and what your response is to him it's got to be more than just come to church it's got to be something that that that is more than I just raised up my hand or I sang a song [Music] but when we come to draw an eye on the revelation of the blood Revelation that there's a life that go that that is inside of that Blood Brother Jim tell us about about what what that life is without the understanding of what it has done for us wow where did the blood come from the word blessed that was my next statement yeah please that's great as two shall agree is to touching anything on Earth my father will honor it amen the word bled the blood somebody but when that Roman soldier pierced his side plit opened the blood cell okay the life that was in that blood came and now since it wasn't the blood or life of an animal now that life of the blood of the pleading word comes in you know who caused you to do it's going to cause you to live the life of the blood that came out of the word you live anything else every day with Jesus is sweeter than the day before you know brother Isaiah no matter if you're a rookie or a veteran because when the death angel was gonna pass he didn't care how old they were it didn't matter if there were a baby if they were an old man even an animal even if you were a lamb or a goat or a person of the male right how many firstborns do we have in here firstborn too huh tambien now watch this he says I don't believe the death angel came to every house and said hey what are you eating today he says no he said no the death angel never looked what they were eating on the inside he knew by the blood that the lamb was inside you know say say that again I want you to really capture this thing he knew by the he says here he says he knew by the blood that there was a lamp man this is the one that I feel like preaching here so so yeah so yesterday I'm I'm out to lunch right what were you eating yeah I was just drinking a cup of coffee and I was reading the book of Exodus you know and I came across Exodus chapter 22. if they were to put it on there for me Exodus 12 22. and as I was reading the scripture the Holy Spirit caught my attention on this brother and ye shall take a bunch of hyssopo and dip it in the blood that is in the Basin and strike the lentil and the two side posts with the blood that is in the Basin and none of you shall go out the door of his house until the morning you know I was just about to go into verse 23. you know but it's it's awesome how the Holy Spirit Works he says read it again and ye shall take a bunch and he says stop it a bunch take a bunch of hyssa um I mean it's it's simple right what the word Bunch means right it is like you know an example there's a bunch of us in here foreign [Music] it means now aguda means a band aguda is not like abandoned like a plane like people yeah like a rubber band kind of like a band Elastica it means binding chords uh and this is where the Holy Spirit caught my attention right here [Music] a band of man um a band of troops and they also made a vault of heavens one more time Vault of Heaven both of the heavens and it also means binding Earth to the heaven so now the holy spirit so I I read this and nobody got to get a little bit excited right now I'm there at McDonald's and I'm beside myself okay I'm having church at McDonald's and so so now the holy spirit says Now read it with the definition insertive and speak to something definition we heard a tremendous a couple of tremendous uh messages on faith from Brother Enrique and brother Diego escuchamos and so I'm going to read it like this and ye shall take a band of men full of Faith because Faith right at least so we heard we heard that in the last panel last week and this man of Faith you're gonna dip it into the blood is that is why the the this this Passover is so important and you shall take the take a band of man of faith and what are these men gonna do for they shall bind Heaven and Earth by the ultimate sacrifice which was the Lord Jesus Christ so so how can so how can people say we no longer need the Blood Brothers they say Naturally Speaking that the blood of Jesus fell to the ground and dried up in London but before it dried up the Earth absorbed it the literal blood of the Lord Jesus Christ fell to the ground the Earth which we are and that's why brother Tom brother the blood runs through the spiritual veins of the Bride they said it was a transference now our founding pastor preached on the message the transferring of the Kingdom uh you know and now I can understand that just a little bit more of what he meant by that you know so because again I already hear the way I have it before the blood dried up and it went through the Earth how you might ask which we are brother Branham says the blood of Jesus runs through the veins of the bread how you might ask by The Binding Heaven El Cielo and Earth and that's what Jesus came to do is to bind heaven heaven is look at this whatever you buying brother Ronnie if you bind Heaven and Earth together the voice of the blood of Christ the greatest things that's where the blood Cries From it's the voice of the blood says Heaven and Earth has United and every time we hear the voice of the blood now based on what he just said but I want to dramatize it to you a little bit full obedience to the full word full obedience to the full word entitles you or Valencia complete is it just an individual or is it you undivido or so how can you fully obey the words to the word entitles you to the Token there's a word right there all those words together fullness of the world of the word has brought us to the fullness of time so if I could just ask a little question here how many think that the blood is dried up and there's no significance trying to catch you guys to see if you're sleeping or not but how many believe that the blood is still fresh as it was 2 000 years ago yeah you guys are real convincing tonight let me just just one more time how many believe that the blood is still fresh today as it was 2 000 years ago speak unto the children and say unto them ES concerning the Feast of the Lord but you shall Proclaim and this is what I did not understand until the other day yeah we we always say that the eighth day is the holy convocation and it is but each one of those feasts was a holy convocation even though there's a cap to the pyramid finish to the work each one was a holy convocation de la fiesta the last note convocation convocation an assembly of persons called yamados individually no call together to a meeting something called out the persons the place the rehearsal and then the word it looks like the word hallowed sanctificado means to make holy or set apart holy youth the prophet of God tells us and this is the evening time of the age that we live in this is the evening time for for the church and this he says is the evening time for me yes this is the evening time of my message I'm moving out is in the evening time of the Gospel we've come up to justification and so forth yeah but this is the time that the token has to be applied for the animal life could not come back upon the human being when the blood was shed the life went out of course because it was a unit and when the life's blood was gone from it the life being different from the blood now the blood is the chemistry of the life LA sangres but the light is something different from the blood but the life is in the blood and the animal life could not come back upon the worshiper La Vida you heard that on Sunday when he shed this Blood of the Lamb to apply the chemistry because that that that the life was gone and could not come back but I'm in this glorious place under this Covenant there is a difference between the blood and the life for the believer today is the Holy Ghost is a chemistry but it is the holy spirit of God this is the token that God requires of the church see it in every one of us what is the token a sign of it's the life but what does it proof it has the purchasing power paid for yes it's already yours yes so when you go to pray you present your token there's no way for him to turn you down the proof of the purchase in your hands so our name is as so our name on the check is just good absolutely now now give us the preview and hit us on the on that last book the the bomb that you can do the audio one too and then and then hit the Tabernacle this is the Coming Attraction this is the bomb I will hijack that quote quick quick I sent brother Jimmy every time a quote the other day of our founding pastors there's no way to finish we're gonna just drop this Bomba well I sent it to him and he tried stealing it so yeah he says now Jesus was going to change he said Jesus change or bring a New Covenant but in order to
