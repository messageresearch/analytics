[42:08] before you lord this afternoon
[42:10] with our hearts full of joy at these
[42:15] two people have found
[42:18] each other but we pray father that
[42:22] they have found you first for you are
[42:25] the author and the finisher of our faith
[42:28] and everything that we do in word and
[42:31] indeed

[42:35] and father
[42:36] as we draw an eye to you we ask father
[42:39] that you will come to this ceremony

[42:44] come to
[42:45] give us today and that is your love and
[42:48] father
[42:48] when this is all over we'll be sure to
[42:51] give you all the honor
[42:52] and all the glory in the name of the
[42:54] lord jesus christ we pray
[42:56] amen you may be seated
[43:06] for a few moments i i want to express to
[43:10] you a few things
[43:11] this afternoon as
[43:15] we have for the last few weeks we've
[43:20] been to two weddings three funerals so
[43:22] this is a completely
[43:25] different occasion
[43:28] and i asked joe as i saw him
[43:31] two two weeks ago him and rebecca got
[43:33] married
[43:34] and i asked him uh if he still liked her
[43:38] and uh he says no i
[43:41] love her and that's really really good i
[43:45] appreciate appreciate that and we're
[43:49] appreciative to to this fine couple that
[43:51] has come here
[43:52] this uh afternoon i've never seen a
[43:55] wedding party more colorful than you all
[43:58] today
[43:59] but that that that that is always good
[44:01] to bring color
[44:03] into the situation the bible speaks to
[44:06] us
[44:07] for a few moments charity suffereth long
[44:11] and is kind charity envieth not
[44:16] charity wanteth not itself
[44:19] is not puffed up does not behave itself
[44:23] unseemly seeketh not her own
[44:27] is not easily provoked thinketh no evil
[44:32] rejoices not in iniquity but rejoices
[44:36] in the truth charity
[44:39] the bible says never
[44:42] faileth but whether there be
[44:46] prophecies they shall fail whether there
[44:48] shall be tongues
[44:49] they shall cease whether there be
[44:51] knowledge it shall
[44:53] vanish away and again
[44:56] charity never fails
[45:00] charity is the term that is used in
[45:03] scripture
[45:04] but as we understand that charity is
[45:07] love in the book of matthew the 19th
[45:10] chapter and the eighth verse and the
[45:12] last part of that verse it says
[45:14] but from the beginning it was not
[45:18] so the prophet of god tells us
[45:21] marriage is the oldest institution in
[45:23] the world
[45:25] marriage was first performed and
[45:27] instituted
[45:28] in the garden of eden in understanding
[45:32] what has been given to us around the
[45:35] world
[45:36] there are many things that have have
[45:38] have eluded us
[45:40] and have come into into into direct
[45:43] conflict with what we believe as as a
[45:46] people
[45:47] it was not an accident that god started
[45:50] creation with a marriage
[45:53] and in in ourselves around the world
[45:55] when we see
[45:56] the the the battle fronts and and we see
[45:59] the assault completely on the marriage
[46:01] and
[46:02] in the institution that we know that it
[46:04] is between a man
[46:06] and a woman that is what god instituted
[46:09] in the beginning
[46:10] adam and eve it was not again
[46:13] it was it was it is not an accident that
[46:16] god started creation with the marriage
[46:19] when you look into the scripture the
[46:21] bible speaks to us but from the
[46:23] beginning of the creation
[46:25] god made them male and female and then
[46:28] he says for this cause shall a man leave
[46:30] his father and mother
[46:31] and cleave to his wife and they twain
[46:34] shall be one flesh
[46:36] so then they are no more twain but one
[46:39] flesh
[46:40] what therefore god hath joined together
[46:43] let not man put asunder
[46:46] when each time i think as
[46:49] we hear the man say the level of
[46:52] violence and evil that has been
[46:54] unleashed these days all i can think
[46:57] about is the teachings of the ancient
[46:58] prophet
[46:59] jeremiah as he sought to speak to the
[47:02] children of judah
[47:03] in vain to depart from their evil ways
[47:06] and their waywardness
[47:08] that earned him the name the weeping
[47:10] prophet
[47:11] one of the institutions that has
[47:13] received the greatest bastion of all
[47:16] is the institution of marriage i say
[47:18] this afternoon that the church should
[47:20] not be
[47:21] silent upon that that issue when you
[47:24] come into the
[47:25] the basis of the knowledge of the truth
[47:27] anything happens today and anything is
[47:30] normal living together becomes normal
[47:33] doing different things of the world has
[47:35] become normal
[47:36] but in the beginning it was not so and
[47:39] when we understand
[47:41] the ruling of god in our lives we come
[47:44] here today because
[47:46] i don't come here today just to see such
[47:48] beautiful people
[47:49] even though we we see a great audience
[47:52] of
[47:53] very nice people we come today for god
[47:56] himself to come
[47:57] and put his seal of approval on this
[47:59] marriage that's the only way that this
[48:01] this marriage will ever
[48:02] last even amongst evangelicals today
[48:07] 50 of the people getting a
[48:10] a divorce out in the world in the
[48:13] secular world
[48:14] more than 60 of the people end up in
[48:17] divorce and you
[48:18] wind up and you find out why well there
[48:21] are extenuating circumstances of why
[48:23] people
[48:23] aren't together and there are
[48:25] generalized and etc
[48:27] and we can go by case by case but the
[48:29] simplicity of the of the gospel is
[48:32] i was cutting hair one day and i i
[48:35] i i asked a man told me and i we were as
[48:38] we were conversating about
[48:40] about marriage he said one day his mama
[48:44] or or his wife i should say went to his
[48:48] father's home and said uh dad we're
[48:51] having trouble
[48:53] and this is what i want to get to maybe
[48:56] to the adults
[48:57] and the parents and the grandparents of
[48:59] these two fine people this
[49:01] this afternoon is everybody's got an
[49:04] opinion on how
[49:04] you should rate you should you should be
[49:06] in your house everybody's got an opinion
[49:08] of what they should do but there's only
[49:10] one that should
[49:11] should rule in our home and that that is
[49:13] god
[49:14] and i i look and i i see and and
[49:17] and he the the lady comes to the papa's
[49:20] house and says dad i'm leaving this man
[49:24] she said well first i got to ask you two
[49:25] questions does he beat you
[49:28] he says no does he go out on you
[49:31] no he says well then get out of my home
[49:34] and go fix your own problems this
[49:38] is what is inside of ourselves should be
[49:42] everybody's got an opinion papa's got an
[49:44] opinion grandpapa's got an opinion
[49:46] everybody's got an opinion i wouldn't do
[49:48] that of course you wouldn't do that
[49:50] you're not you're not them
[49:51] everybody's an individual but when we
[49:54] comment this afternoon that you're
[49:56] taking
[49:56] these these great vows that you have
[50:00] that we are going to give you it is
[50:02] something of vast importance
[50:04] that that not that only death can
[50:08] separate
[50:08] and can can can do that it shouldn't be
[50:12] that anyone to come in we know we have
[50:14] our marriage counselors
[50:16] we know we have our pastor that gives us
[50:18] the guide but after that
[50:20] when you go to your mama's home when you
