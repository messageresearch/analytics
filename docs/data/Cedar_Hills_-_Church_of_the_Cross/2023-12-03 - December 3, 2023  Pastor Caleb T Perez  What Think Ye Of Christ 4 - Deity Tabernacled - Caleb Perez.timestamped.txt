[45:04] preached let me see number
[45:10] one to reveal himself in Christ number
[45:18] two to have preeminence in his
[45:22] bride
[45:24] three rest the kingdom I want to just
[45:28] tell you this before we get
[45:30] going in the
[45:34] 1970s I don't know who the minister
[45:38] was but uh this this older
[45:45] Minister he told our founding pastor
[45:50] this if you can ever fully understand
[45:54] Christ is the m mystery of God
[46:01] revealed you're close to
[46:05] home that's how important this message
[46:09] is we are close to
[46:12] home so let's let's pray that God would
[46:14] open up our
[46:18] understanding Matthew chapter
[46:21] 22 verse 41- 46 I'm sorry I'm just going
[46:26] to read 41 and
[46:30] 42 Matthew 22 when you have it you can
[46:33] say
[46:38] amen and while the Pharisees were
[46:40] gathered together Jesus asked
[46:45] them saying what think ye of
[46:49] Christ whose son is
[46:52] he they say unto him the son of David
[46:57] now we know that we know that that
[47:00] Christ means help
[47:03] me the anointed one
[47:11] or this is number four
[47:14] already the anointed one
[47:17] or the Messiah very good may God add His
[47:21] blessings to the reading of his word you
[47:23] may be
[47:24] seated
[47:26] amen and amen
[47:29] amen I was thinking about all these
[47:32] babies these babies being
[47:37] born and uh this scripture this
[47:40] scripture came to
[47:42] me and I and it just began to work in
[47:46] me and uh so if we can be so you can be
[47:49] so kind to open your Bibles to the Book
[47:51] of Job the 38th
[47:54] chapter
[47:57] we're going to read verses 1 through
[48:10] 4 when you have it you can say
[48:14] amen and the Lord answered job out of
[48:17] the Whirlwind and
[48:22] said who is this that darkeneth counsel
[48:25] by words without
[48:31] knowledge I believe that this is this
[48:34] question is being asked to every one of
[48:38] us who is this that darken
[48:43] counsel I'm going to stop for a moment
[48:46] here because what it's really asking
[48:51] here who is
[48:53] this that is withhold holding
[48:57] light from my
[49:00] plan my
[49:02] advice my
[49:05] purpose who's this that's darkening the
[49:08] counsel who's this that's keeping light
[49:11] from from reaching my plan or my
[49:16] advice and they're doing it by
[49:19] words but they're words without
[49:24] knowledge
[49:26] words words that have no life to back it
[49:31] up such as I I Love You
[49:35] Lord and God says you tell me that with
[49:39] your
[49:40] lips but your hearts are far from
[49:44] that verse three says G up now thy loins
[49:49] like a
[49:52] man I believe that the only ones that
[49:54] can truly
[49:56] uh answer this
[50:00] question are those that have reached the
[50:03] stature of a perfect
[50:07] man for I will demand of thee and answer
[50:10] thou
[50:13] me we are living in a time now that he
[50:16] is demanding an answer from
[50:21] us where was thou when I laid the found
[50:25] foundations of the
[50:28] earth declare if thou Hast
[50:34] understanding when the morning Stars
[50:36] sang
[50:41] together and all the sons of God shouted
[50:44] for
[50:47] Joy my question to you is where were
[50:52] you so ask your neighbor that question
[50:56] where were you
[51:00] neighbor you're not at no some of you
[51:02] did in other words you
[51:04] know you got to get into it a little bit
[51:08] here where were you when the sons of God
[51:11] shouted for
[51:14] Joy ask your neighbor again where were
[51:17] you when the sons of God shouted for
[51:24] joy and not just some of the
[51:26] [Music]
[51:27] sons the Bible says where were you in
[51:30] all the sons of
[51:33] God shout for
[51:36] Joy what think you of
[51:38] Christ who son is he where were you when
[51:42] all the sons of God shouted for
[51:47] Joy you can begin to see more and
[51:51] more why brother brandham says that your
[51:54] decision on this
[51:58] scripture and what this scripture is
[52:03] asking it will seal your Eternal
[52:08] destination why because if you don't
[52:12] know by a revelation whose son he
[52:17] is then you'll never know whose son you
[52:21] are is that right come on now each one
[52:24] of you want to know who son you
[52:27] are we're either his son or we're the
[52:29] other guy's
[52:32] sons and if you don't know whose son you
[52:35] are you'll never be able to answer that
[52:40] question where were
[52:42] you I want to know where I was
[52:46] amen everybody
[52:54] hereall hold on a second can everybody
[52:56] just bow their heads for a
[53:05] moment Jesus name
[53:11] Lord tou our
[53:18] brother oh the enemy just wants to
[53:20] disrupt Lord
[53:23] but but Lord you are in
[53:26] control in Jesus name Satan you take
[53:29] your hands off him at this
[53:35] moment believe
[53:54] it
[54:10] we're in a battle is that
[54:12] right we're in a
[54:15] battle he wants to interrupt that's
[54:19] okay we ain't backing down that's for
[54:23] sure he doesn't want us to know who we
[54:27] are doesn't want us to know whose son we
[54:30] are he doesn't want us to know where we
[54:33] were from the
[54:34] beginning it gives us such a such a joy
[54:37] to
[54:38] know that God cares about
[54:42] us now your neighbor God cares about us
[54:47] neighbor amen and we are answering these
[54:51] questions no other time in history
[54:56] has there ever been a
[54:58] people that are so
[55:00] sure about who they
[55:03] are said right now this is the time
[55:06] church this is the time that that we
[55:09] have been placed here on
[55:12] Earth and that's why this scripture kept
[55:16] coming back to
[55:18] me and I would read it and then it kept
[55:20] coming back to
[55:21] me and I would say what what's the
[55:24] purpose of this of this coming to
[55:28] me but then it began to make so much
[55:32] sense why was there so much joy in
[55:37] Heaven Come On Church why was there so
[55:40] much
[55:41] joy why did you shout in the
[55:45] beginning we got to know why we
[55:48] shouted because if we know why we
[55:51] shouted back
[55:53] then then we're going to know why we're
[55:55] shouting
[55:58] today now how many of you know why we
[56:00] shouted in the
[56:03] beginning how many want how many of you
[56:06] know why all the sons of God
[56:10] shouted imagine the the joy that was
[56:14] there that's why Jesus said the glory
[56:17] that I had with you from the
[56:21] beginning the prophet of God tells us
[56:23] exactly why we were
[56:27] shouting are you ready are you ready now
[56:30] you you know this you've heard it
[56:33] before he says but those shining
[56:40] ones shouted for
[56:43] Joy when they seen that
[56:47] someday they were going to be
[56:49] tabernacled here on
[56:53] Earth oh my my I'm going to say it again
[56:57] say it again they shouted for
[57:00] Joy because they knew that one
[57:04] day they were going to be tabernacled
[57:07] here on
[57:09] Earth that's why this came to
[57:12] me I was talking to brother brother
[57:15] Jerry and sister
[57:16] Faith and they said the babies they
[57:18] coming a little
[57:21] soon they're right on
[57:23] time why because they they're they're
[57:26] ready if you could see your children
[57:29] they're they're
[57:31] excited their spirit is so
[57:35] excited because they were they're
[57:37] getting ready to be
[57:40] Tabernacles hallelujah hallelujah I'm
[57:43] going to say now if we were if we were
[57:46] shouting for
[57:49] Joy why are we still not
[57:53] shouting why have we lost our
[57:57] shout when we're going through hard
[57:59] times and things don't turn out the way
[58:02] we
[58:03] want just remember we shouted at one
[58:08] time now we are
[58:12] Tabernacle it should be a
[58:15] joy that's why Paul would say I counted
[58:18] a
[58:20] joy I fall into diverse
[58:23] Temptations and and whatever I go
[58:25] through it's a joy for
[58:29] me he knew he had shouted in the
[58:33] beginning now now notice this now how
[58:35] many of you are are excited that you

[59:51] glorious
[59:53] time oh I could just see their their
[59:56] little Spirits getting
[59:59] excited we're going to be tabernacled

[1:00:03] moment and I can just see those babies
[1:00:06] and when they came
[1:00:08] out and that Spirit joined together with
[1:00:11] that
[1:00:13] body and they began to
[1:00:16] scream let me interpret their
[1:00:21] screams when all we hear
[1:00:23] is
[1:00:26] I'm hearing I'm

[1:09:08] that
[1:09:10] deity wants to be
[1:09:16] Tabernacles I'm going to say it again
[1:09:20] deity dying to be
[1:09:22] Tabernacle
[1:09:26] as much as you wanted to come and be
[1:09:32] tabernacled deity also wants to

[1:09:59] desecrate the
[1:10:04] temple this is the synonyms of the word
[1:10:09] desecrate it means to violate
[1:10:12] it
[1:10:15] profane treat

[1:19:12] commission not ashamed of who we
[1:19:18] are let's quit with our Pico down all
[1:19:21] the time wa uh
[1:19:25] because because things just didn't go
[1:19:27] the way we
[1:19:30] thought
[1:19:31] wow you're living in the glare of
[1:19:33] another
[1:19:36] age I hope things
[1:19:39] change this
[1:19:41] age perfect
[1:19:45] faith not perfect
[1:19:47] Hope come on now I'm I'm I'm trying to
[1:19:50] get to the core of all this
[1:19:54] where do we
[1:19:55] live we can talk a good
[1:19:59] talk but do we have the authority behind
[1:20:03] it let's find out where we're supposed
[1:20:06] to
[1:20:06] be we live in an every changing
[1:20:11] world and the only thing that does not
[1:20:16] change is is God's
[1:20:20] word Roger is that your Mama Rogers Mama
[1:20:25] God
[1:20:26] bless how nice to have
[1:20:34] you we live in this everchanging
[1:20:38] world it seems to get harder and
[1:20:42] harder I'm going to hit home here it
[1:20:45] seems because I I talk to people all the
[1:20:49] time and I get the same response listen
[1:20:52] closely
[1:20:54] uh it seems harder and
[1:20:57] harder to get an answer from
[1:21:00] God am I talking to
[1:21:06] anybody I prayed about this brother I
[1:21:09] prayed and I fasted and I prayed and and
[1:21:11] I I don't get an
[1:21:15] answer and it seems like the more I pray
[1:21:18] the more silent God
[1:21:21] is
[1:21:24] am I talking to anybody
[1:21:27] here
[1:21:28] no well either you don't feel like that
[1:21:30] or you're not praying one of the
[1:21:33] two let me see your hands if you pray
[1:21:36] something he just no I just I can't get
[1:21:38] an
[1:21:41] answer have you desecrated the temple in
[1:21:43] some
[1:21:46] way you're trying to get God to meet
[1:21:51] you with a desecrated
[1:21:56] Temple you know I I stop for a moment
[1:21:58] here because I we have an altar here and
[1:22:02] and at times people come to the
[1:22:05] altar nothing wrong with the
[1:22:08] altar this is but it's just like a
[1:22:11] symbol right it's a
[1:22:13] type the real altar is in your
[1:22:17] heart but let me ask you this question
[1:22:20] how many of you have ever come to the
[1:22:22] altar
[1:22:24] not to ask for
[1:22:28] anything but to come to the
[1:22:31] Altar and just offer him
[1:22:34] something and just say Lord I'm here I
[1:22:36] don't need you I just need you but I
[1:22:41] want to praise you and I want to glorify
[1:22:44] you I come bringing my offering my gift
[1:22:48] to
[1:22:49] the that's it
[1:22:50] Lord anybody ever come like
[1:22:54] that usually we come to the altar Lord I
[1:22:56] need this Lord I need that like he
[1:22:59] doesn't know what we
[1:23:05] need that's why after a while we don't
[1:23:10] hear I'm getting to something
[1:23:13] here that's why we don't get
[1:23:15] nothing we cry Lord
[1:23:19] Lord we cry Jesus Jesus
[1:23:24] and we don't get an
[1:23:25] answer I guess the Lord doesn't love
[1:23:28] me you ever desecrated your
[1:23:34] temple come on husbands and
[1:23:37] wives you ever speak to each other each
[1:23:40] other with
[1:23:43] profanity you're not only profaning your
[1:23:46] temple but her
[1:23:50] Temple that's right
[1:23:54] let me see no no
[1:24:00] no come on now be
[1:24:03] honest you ever Dishonored your
[1:24:08] vows it's important that we've
[1:24:14] tabernacled have you disrespected one
[1:24:18] another have you ever abused your
[1:24:21] spouse
[1:24:23] gotten
[1:24:25] physical
[1:24:32] or
[1:24:41] uhoh the shut
[1:24:47] up
[1:24:48] good because we got to take inventory
[1:24:51] right now
[1:24:54] we are close to the coming of the Lord
[1:24:57] Church what are we
[1:24:59] doing have you vandalized the
[1:25:05] Tabernacle by breaking each other's
[1:25:09] hearts come on church
[1:25:12] members how you treated one another or
[1:25:15] another brother and sister with
[1:25:19] disrespect come on these are all
[1:25:21] desecrations
[1:25:23] have you ever contamin contaminated
[1:25:26] someone else's
[1:25:28] Temple by dumping trash on
[1:25:33] them because not only your Tabernacle
[1:25:37] but their
[1:25:40] tabernac if we
[1:25:42] have we'll answer to
[1:25:46] God but God Made A
[1:25:51] Way
[1:25:53] that if we have failed in those
[1:25:56] things there still
[1:25:58] is Mercy and Grace
[1:26:02] today I don't know about
[1:26:04] tomorrow but if you find yourself
[1:26:06] somewhere
[1:26:09] here do something about it
[1:26:13] today are you with
[1:26:15] me want to hit home why those Devils
[1:26:19] they don't want they want to
[1:26:21] interrupt
[1:26:23] as I was pondering
[1:26:24] this I said Lord why is it that so many
[1:26:27] just I hear the same
[1:26:30] thing why is it that that you seem
[1:26:33] silent to
[1:26:36] many this is the word of the Lord that
[1:26:38] he gave to
[1:26:39] me as I was talking to
[1:26:43] him as I was talking to
[1:26:46] him I heard him say
[1:26:49] this are you ready listen
[1:26:53] listen he said I went down to rescue
[1:26:59] them but now it's time for them to come
[1:27:01] to where I
[1:27:06] am always expecting him to come to
[1:27:10] you to when are you going to come to him
[1:27:14] he already came to you he already
[1:27:16] stretched down his hand for
[1:27:18] you he already saved you but now he want
[1:27:22] wants
[1:27:23] you as he became
[1:27:26] us for us to become
[1:27:30] him now where do we live do we still
[1:27:33] live in Luther's
[1:27:35] age Wesley's agey Pentecostal age no
[1:27:39] come up higher church we have been
[1:27:42] invited to come up
[1:27:44] higher notice notice this is what he
[1:27:48] says the reason they don't get the
[1:27:50] answers that they're looking for
[1:27:54] is because they are not meeting
[1:27:57] me in my only provided place of
[1:28:03] worship in
[1:28:07] Christ that's the Revelation
[1:28:10] today and you ain't going to meet him
[1:28:12] any other
[1:28:13] way under any other Revelation but
[1:28:16] Christ is the
[1:28:19] Myst he said and unless they come into
[1:28:24] Christ their
[1:28:26] position I will not meet them any other
[1:28:30] place he goes on and says tell
[1:28:34] them that I no longer am winking at
[1:28:37] their
[1:28:41] ignorance I am
[1:28:45] requiring each one to give an
[1:28:49] account for their thoughts their words
[1:28:53] their decisions their action there's no
[1:28:57] longer an excuse for being
[1:29:01] ignorant for the message has been
[1:29:05] given the Myster is
[1:29:09] revealed and that's why they must get my
[1:29:11] word in
[1:29:15] them thus
[1:29:19] say still with me Church
[1:29:22] making us dig
[1:29:26] deep you you can't even turn on the the
[1:29:30] news and you see 50 volcanoes erupting
[1:29:33] at the same
[1:29:37] time 50 volcanoes at the same
[1:29:40] time what is it birth
[1:29:43] pains the world wanting to put forth
[1:29:46] another A New
[1:29:49] Earth but at the same token
[1:29:53] his bride bringing forth the
[1:29:57] word we look at this floods and
[1:30:04] Wars everywhere we turn trouble on every
[1:30:07] on every
[1:30:09] turn but amidst it
[1:30:12] all our focus is not on
[1:30:15] that our focus should be on
[1:30:19] him we can't make it on the pastor's
[1:30:30] coil you can't make it on your Mama and
[1:30:32] Daddy's
[1:30:36] coattail come on
[1:30:40] church we just like to make it the easy
[1:30:44] route not no
[1:30:46] more you got to have your own
[1:30:48] [Music]
[1:30:50] experience how many of you believe that
[1:30:52] the Holy Ghost is
[1:30:54] Christ sure
[1:30:57] absolutely the message testimony of a
[1:30:59] true
[1:31:01] witness he says
[1:31:04] deity God tabernacled in
[1:31:10] man it's more than a
[1:31:14] sensation this is where we miss it we
[1:31:17] come to church we get a
[1:31:20] sensation really got it
[1:31:23] now and tomorrow you're back in the
[1:31:26] dump what did you
[1:31:29] get come on ask yourself the qu what did
[1:31:31] I
[1:31:36] get it's a
[1:31:38] question it's more than a
[1:31:41] sensation more than speaking in tongues
[1:31:44] it's more than shouting in the
[1:31:47] spirit it's more than
[1:31:49] weeping it's more than joining the
[1:31:53] church God living in
[1:31:58] man God
[1:32:01] himself tabernacled in that
[1:32:05] person when he can
[1:32:08] speak and it's just the same as God
[1:32:13] speaking that's the Church of Jesus
[1:32:16] Christ that's the
[1:32:19] way the First Apostolic Church Church
[1:32:22] went
[1:32:25] forth do we expect anything
[1:32:32] less that's not our
[1:32:36] priority that's why we're sitting in
[1:32:38] church and we're falling
[1:32:42] asleep right why not our
[1:32:46] priority oh this is not the message you
[1:32:48] thought I was going to
[1:32:50] PR
[1:32:54] going to help you
[1:32:56] this against nobody I'm not mad at
[1:32:59] nobody not at the
[1:33:04] Devil what Satan wants is discredit
[1:33:09] Christ all he needs to do is get you to
[1:33:12] doubt one
[1:33:16] word that Spirit of antichrist is so
[1:33:20] subtle a
[1:33:25] deceptive that even if you have
[1:33:29] thoughts that part of this Bible is not
[1:33:38] true how many believe every word that's
[1:33:41] here even if you were to have a
[1:33:44] thought that one word was not
[1:33:48] true then the spirit that's in you
[1:33:54] not because Christ is the
[1:34:01] word we're excited about a lot of
[1:34:04] things right something one person does
[1:34:08] something in church and everybody does
[1:34:12] it oh come on you act like I I don't
[1:34:15] know what I'm talking
[1:34:20] about
[1:34:23] next thing you know everybody's at Cold
[1:34:25] plant it's a good thing a good
[1:34:32] thing did you hear that sisters at the
[1:34:38] gym oh

[1:34:50] get
[1:34:52] see where he's going with
[1:34:55] this you got some of you give me the
[1:34:57] funniest
[1:34:59] faces but is it not true next thing you
[1:35:02] know all the sisters in church are going
[1:35:03] to the
[1:35:05] gym and little by little then one starts
[1:35:07] putting on a her little tight little
[1:35:11] things you call then well I guess it's
[1:35:14] okay she did
[1:35:16] it you are so far from
[1:35:20] the
[1:35:22] it's always let's see who can do
[1:35:23] something

[1:35:46] message while I'm while I'm
[1:35:49] jogging that's problem
[1:35:52] but the funny thing about all this and I
[1:35:53] want you to hear me
[1:35:55] closely the funny thing about all this
[1:35:58] is that the more you do
[1:36:00] that the colder you become in
[1:36:04] church and then you don't raise your
[1:36:06] hands

[1:38:44] me instead we get around
[1:38:47] people leave him leave her
[1:38:52] wow and we're
[1:38:55] Christians God have mercy on
[1:38:58] us let's go on let's go on here notice
[1:39:01] this
[1:39:03] now Matthew
[1:39:05] 24:23 then if any man shall say unto you
[1:39:08] Lo here is Christ or there believe it
[1:39:13] not
[1:39:20] 2423
[1:39:25] for there shall arise false
[1:39:28] christs notice that does not have a
[1:39:30] small
[1:39:34] sea it has a capital
[1:39:37] sea there shall arise false
[1:39:41] Christ and false
[1:39:44] prophets there shall arise notice
[1:39:47] now how many christs are
[1:39:50] there
[1:39:54] bunch of
[1:39:56] anointed preaches anointed ones at the
[1:40:00] end you know
[1:40:03] why he says
[1:40:06] ones because everybody thinks that
[1:40:08] there's one big Christ and a bunch of
[1:40:10] small Christ running
[1:40:15] around our founding Pastor would say I
[1:40:18] don't believe in little Christ
[1:40:23] I Believe In
[1:40:25] Christ and we are part of
[1:40:27] Christ God did not have a bunch of
[1:40:32] christs God had one Christ this same
[1:40:36] Jesus thou has
[1:40:39] crucified God has made
[1:40:42] him Lord and Christ what's the
[1:40:47] problem we didn't come from somewhere
[1:40:49] else we're not a separate entity from
[1:40:52] Christ we came from
[1:40:55] him amen hallelujah was God tabernacled
[1:40:59] in
[1:41:01] flesh and it's something that Satan
[1:41:04] cannot
[1:41:05] do I hope you get this Satan cannot do
[1:41:09] what God
[1:41:11] did Satan cannot make a body and step
[1:41:14] into it and be a
[1:41:17] man do that church only God could
[1:41:22] because God is the only
[1:41:25] Creator and he made himself a
[1:41:29] body and he stepped into the
[1:41:32] body and the Bible says that God was in
[1:41:37] Christ reconciling the world to
[1:41:42] himself okay now we're getting
[1:41:44] somewhere Satan can't do
[1:41:49] that what does he do
[1:41:51] he has to take a man that's
[1:41:54] already and anoint
[1:41:57] him he's a
[1:42:00] robber put this mind let this mind be in
[1:42:06] you this is where it's at now let this
[1:42:09] mind be in
[1:42:10] you that was in
[1:42:13] Christ let the same mind be in
[1:42:16] you that he thought it not robbery no
[1:42:25] he thought it not
[1:42:27] robbery to be equal with
[1:42:30] God let that mind be in you because when
[1:42:34] you come to that
[1:42:36] understanding of deity
[1:42:40] tabernacled oh church this is something
[1:42:43] that Satan can't
[1:42:45] do this is why we shouted for
[1:42:49] joy
[1:42:53] not only because we were going to be
[1:42:57] tabernacled but because Christ would be
[1:42:59] there with
[1:43:00] us yet a little while and the world will
[1:43:04] see me no more not that man of 2,000
[1:43:07] years
[1:43:09] ago you shall see for I will be with you
[1:43:14] even in you
[1:43:17] tabernacled until the end of the ages
[1:43:21] oh Satan can't do
[1:43:24] that Satan likes to get into
[1:43:29] animals yeah what about that serpent
[1:43:34] man yeah that's how we got in that's how
[1:43:38] he injected himself into the human
[1:43:41] race yes or
[1:43:43] yes Sayan can't do that or or Sayan
[1:43:47] can't do what God
[1:43:49] does that's why he's the
[1:43:52] robber anyone that does not come in
[1:43:54] through the
[1:43:55] door is a robber a thief and a
[1:43:58] robber why that's what he does Satan
[1:44:02] will go in the
[1:44:04] church try to find somebody he can
[1:44:08] anoint he's trying to find somewhere he
[1:44:11] can get
[1:44:13] in he's a
[1:44:17] robber God is not a
[1:44:19] robber God
[1:44:23] Tabernacles Satan doesn't
[1:44:26] Tabernacle Satan takes possession by
[1:44:30] force God is a
[1:44:33] gentleman when you open your
[1:44:35] heart to you
[1:44:40] Tabernacles yeah yeah anybody here all
[1:44:43] right I'm make sure I'm talking to
[1:44:44] somebody here no notice this now oh I
[1:44:47] got a little bit of time
[1:44:49] still
[1:44:52] I tell you these
[1:44:53] things to be alert young people be
[1:44:57] alert somebody tells you something
[1:45:00] that's not
[1:45:02] scriptural what do you tell
[1:45:11] them but remember you're not talking to
[1:45:13] the
[1:45:15] person our fight's not against flesh and
[1:45:19] blood
[1:45:23] R notice this now today there's a
[1:45:27] belief that's called Christ
[1:45:31] conscience anybody ever heard of
[1:45:33] that Christ
[1:45:37] conscience and the question is
[1:45:40] asked those that believe this do I have
[1:45:43] to be a Christian to achieve Christ
[1:45:49] consciousness
[1:45:52] watch how San trying to get in watch how
[1:45:55] subtle he
[1:45:57] is you can achieve Christ
[1:46:02] Consciousness a
[1:46:04] Christian who needs to go to church
[1:46:08] anymore
[1:46:14] me well it doesn't matter where you go
[1:46:16] to
[1:46:17] church oh it don't no why did he have
[1:46:20] Moses put a Tabernacle in the
[1:46:25] wilderness it matters who teaches you it
[1:46:28] matters where you go to
[1:46:32] church yes or yes all right Christ
[1:46:37] Consciousness is the highest state of
[1:46:40] intellectual
[1:46:45] development and emotional
[1:46:48] maturity it's sometimes termed as as the
[1:46:51] christed
[1:46:55] state because they say it represents the
[1:46:57] sacredness and purity of the
[1:47:04] individual they say that Jesus achieved
[1:47:07] this in his human
[1:47:10] life and was given this term as part of
[1:47:12] his
[1:47:13] [Music]
[1:47:15] name in recognition of the
[1:47:19] achievement the first
[1:47:21] error is that they don't believe that
[1:47:24] Jesus is
[1:47:27] divine red flag someone tells you that
[1:47:31] Jesus is not
[1:47:33] Divine you tell that
[1:47:37] Spirit that's right you don't have to
[1:47:41] listen to everything people tell
[1:47:44] you well let me just hear a little
[1:47:47] bit that next thing you know it you
[1:47:49] don't even know what you
[1:47:51] believe stand firm everything that
[1:47:54] teaches in the
[1:47:56] Bible that's what the prophet of God
[1:47:58] came to
[1:47:59] do to prove that the Bible is
[1:48:02] true the Bible is God in print
[1:48:08] form what he brought not be
[1:48:11] true it's all proven
[1:48:18] here you got to be strong
[1:48:23] don't ever believe that
[1:48:25] Spirit Jesus was both human and
[1:48:32] divine was the god
[1:48:35] man they go on to say that this path is
[1:48:38] open to
[1:48:41] anyone regardless of their religious
[1:48:47] Traditions when they are open to become
[1:48:49] a living vessel of love and truth and
[1:48:57] goodness New Age
[1:49:01] stuff you can never attain that without
[1:49:04] Jesus
[1:49:08] Christ am I boring you
[1:49:11] now
[1:49:13] no be alert hear these things know what
[1:49:16] you're talking
[1:49:17] about they say this is not exclusively
[1:49:20] for
[1:49:22] Christians all the world's religious
[1:49:27] Traditions offer a path to achieving
[1:49:30] this christed
[1:49:34] status all Paths of Love lead to the
[1:49:37] same Divine
[1:49:42] Source all the world's religious
[1:49:45] Traditions offer a
[1:49:49] path
[1:49:52] Jesus said I am the
[1:49:55] way the truth and the
[1:49:58] life no man comes to the
[1:50:02] father but by me there is no other
[1:50:07] way period everything else cut
[1:50:13] up and you by your Traditions make the
[1:50:15] word of God of no
[1:50:19] effect so the people to the people it
[1:50:21] sounds so good and
[1:50:29] inviting but as you look
[1:50:32] closer you see the spirit of
[1:50:36] antichrist there's no such a thing as
[1:50:39] being christed without the
[1:50:44] Christ and he is the
[1:50:47] Christ what think ye of Christ
[1:50:51] can I have like 10
[1:50:54] minutes thank
[1:50:57] you all you get in any false
[1:51:04] cult that you wish to and you see many
[1:51:07] great symbols of true
[1:51:13] Christianity but the man-made
[1:51:16] religions will all come into this
[1:51:20] Antichrist
[1:51:24] religion there'll be two forms of them
[1:51:27] one form will come from
[1:51:29] Rome which will be the
[1:51:32] Beast and there is an image unto the
[1:51:35] Beast which will be the ecclesiastical
[1:51:39] head of the Protestant
[1:51:44] Church it'll all come under one great
[1:51:48] Dominion and the Antichrist will be the
[1:51:52] one that's enthroned and
[1:51:57] seated so if
[1:52:00] Antichrist is to be against Christ
[1:52:05] teaching this is the reason he's so much
[1:52:08] against
[1:52:11] Christ because teaching is what
[1:52:13] positions
[1:52:16] us and the goal of the Antichrist is to
[1:52:19] keep us from finding our
[1:52:25] position I'm going to I'm going to skip
[1:52:28] some of these things and get to this
[1:52:29] other
[1:52:33] part that's why he's so
[1:52:36] against he keeps us so
[1:52:40] occupied how many of you find yourself
[1:52:42] occupied in a lot of stuff that don't
[1:52:44] even matter in
[1:52:48] life
[1:52:52] NOP
[1:52:56] I people like
[1:52:59] that raise your hand no no okay how many
[1:53:04] of you find
[1:53:07] yourself doing so many
[1:53:10] things doesn't even
[1:53:12] matter hour after hour after
[1:53:17] hour the crazy thing about
[1:53:21] it right when you get a thought that
[1:53:23] says read your
[1:53:26] Bible yeah yeah yeah one more one more
[1:53:29] one more Tik
[1:53:31] Tok next thing know it 50 Tik toks have
[1:53:34] gone
[1:53:36] by and then we don't
[1:53:40] have why is he so against
[1:53:45] Christ it was the war in
[1:53:48] heaven but what watch then when we
[1:53:52] understand the
[1:53:55] shout then we understand First
[1:53:58] Corinthians
[1:54:05] 123 wherefore I give you to
[1:54:09] understand how many want to understand I
[1:54:11] want to understand that no man speaking
[1:54:15] by the spirit of
[1:54:17] God Called Jesus a
[1:54:21] cursed and that no
[1:54:23] man can say that Jesus is the
[1:54:29] Lord but by the Holy
[1:54:35] Ghost this is good stuff just give me
[1:54:37] like 10 15 minutes and I'm let me just
[1:54:39] put this on your
[1:54:41] lap no man and call Jesus the
[1:54:46] Lord except by the Holy Ghost
[1:54:51] you see the
[1:54:52] fight it takes the Holy
[1:54:55] Ghost tabernacled in
[1:54:58] flesh to be able to call Jesus
[1:55:05] Lord is Jesus
[1:55:08] lord how many is he
[1:55:10] Lord Brother Bram says he's your
[1:55:14] savior but is he really your
[1:55:17] Lord oh we're saved No Doubt
[1:55:20] but Lord means total
[1:55:26] ownership that's the only way he can
[1:55:28] have preeminence in
[1:55:31] US is if he becomes
[1:55:33] Lord notice this now he must Tabernacle
[1:55:37] in
[1:55:39] US brother Mark sent me this and I I
[1:55:41] really enjoyed
[1:55:44] this and it's it was a video of a
[1:55:48] man was a pastor missionary for many
[1:55:51] many
[1:55:54] years and he died and this is his
[1:55:57] account I want you to listen closely to
[1:56:00] this this is his
[1:56:02] account I Heard a Voice when I passed
[1:56:09] on that said your works are in
[1:56:15] vain that's
[1:56:17] right this is this is rough to hear
[1:56:23] this is why we got to check our every
[1:56:25] motive and objective of
[1:56:31] everything your Works were in
[1:56:35] vain he was telling that the voice
[1:56:40] everything he had
[1:56:42] done uh did this and I did this and I
[1:56:47] had orphanages and I fed the
[1:56:51] needy and I was Pastor for many
[1:56:54] years and the voice said your works are
[1:56:56] in
[1:56:58] vain the life that you
[1:57:01] lived and offered to
[1:57:04] me is an
[1:57:08] Abomination that I rejected in the
[1:57:13] Pharisees what made you
[1:57:15] think that I would accept it from a
[1:57:20] leodan type
[1:57:25] Christian in fact Untold Millions he
[1:57:30] said that boy
[1:57:31] says are living the same kind of life
[1:57:34] that you
[1:57:37] live and they stand in danger of my
[1:57:40] Everlasting
[1:57:44] wrath the man says I couldn't believe
[1:57:47] that he was talking to me
[1:57:51] I'm a prer I'm a teacher I just told him
[1:57:55] all my good works that I had
[1:57:59] done and the voice says you never did
[1:58:03] those works for
[1:58:06] me you did them for a false
[1:58:10] god list listen to where he what he gets
[1:58:12] to now he said but
[1:58:15] Lord remember no man can call Jesus Lord
[1:58:21] except by the Holy Ghost he said but
[1:58:24] Lord I called you Lord every
[1:58:29] day he said yes but you never made me
[1:58:35] Lord listen closely he said there's a
[1:58:39] difference to call him
[1:58:41] Lord only gives him a
[1:58:45] title but to make him Lord
[1:58:49] promotes him to the ruler of your
[1:58:54] life what was this false god that I had
[1:58:57] been serving he
[1:59:00] says and the voice
[1:59:02] says s e l
[1:59:06] FF in in engl self
[1:59:10] self that's the god that many
[1:59:15] serve
[1:59:16] self why we do it because we want to
[1:59:19] look
[1:59:20] good look what the brother's doing you
[1:59:24] want Glory from the people or you want
[1:59:25] it from
[1:59:27] God well well well I go to
[1:59:30] Africa
[1:59:33] and that's right I'm not saved because I
[1:59:36] go
[1:59:38] anywhere I Don't Preach because I want
[1:59:40] to be
[1:59:41] saved he already saved me but out of my
[1:59:45] I I love him so
[1:59:48] much
[1:59:50] and my respect and honor to
[1:59:52] him all I can do is surrender my
[1:59:56] life and say Lord use
[1:59:59] me if I can be used by you
[2:00:02] Lord let deity be tabernacled in
[2:00:06] me so that I can go spread the
[2:00:10] gospel not how much does brother Caleb
[2:00:14] do I can go to Africa and I can go to
[2:00:17] hell for that
[2:00:21] we feed millions and millions of people
[2:00:23] and still go to
[2:00:26] hell not based on
[2:00:28] that those works are an Abomination to
[2:00:33] God
[2:00:35] unless it is me that's been taken out of
[2:00:38] the
[2:00:40] way and it is Christ that liveth in me
[2:00:44] now now deity is
[2:00:48] Tabernacle now when I speak it's got to
[2:00:51] be him

[2:01:18] judgment
[2:01:20] I want you to get there's going to be a
[2:01:21] lot of surprises at the
[2:01:25] Judgment I remember my father saying one
[2:01:29] time the majority of preachers will be
[2:01:31] going to
[2:01:36] hell because we did it for self instead
[2:01:39] of for
[2:01:41] him not everyone that saith Lord Lord
[2:01:44] shall enter
[2:01:48] in many will say Lord Lord have we not
[2:01:51] prophesied in thy
[2:01:54] name cast out
[2:01:58] devils in thy name done many wonderful
[2:02:02] works and I'll profess
[2:02:08] I but I called you Lord you gave me a
[2:02:12] title never made me ruler of your
[2:02:17] life why do call me Lord the Bible says
[2:02:21] Lord
[2:02:23] Lord and do not the things that I
[2:02:26] say and afterwards the virgins will say
[2:02:29] Lord Lord open to
[2:02:33] us and he'll answer and say verily I
[2:02:36] stand to
[2:02:38] you know you
[2:02:40] not this is not about
[2:02:44] ourselves we have been tabernacled for a
[2:02:47] purpose
[2:02:49] not to be chismosos with one
[2:02:54] another
[2:02:56] hello it's not just to have a good time
[2:02:59] here in this in the earth even though we
[2:03:01] walk have a good
[2:03:05] time we're here for deity to be
[2:03:10] tabernacled just want to say this and
[2:03:12] I'll be
[2:03:14] closing just want to say this as as as
[2:03:17] we as I get to the end
[2:03:25] so much good
[2:03:32] stuff you're either for God or against
[2:03:35] God brother ROM
[2:03:38] says and the outward
[2:03:42] Expressions shows exactly what's on the
[2:03:46] inside and many of you think
[2:03:50] I got the baptism of the Holy
[2:03:53] Ghost I'm going to
[2:03:56] heaven that don't mean one thing that
[2:03:59] you're going to
[2:04:02] heaven I was at church in the Holy Ghost
[2:04:05] really
[2:04:07] fell and we go home and live the same
[2:04:09] kind of
[2:04:13] Life yes or yes
[2:04:16] seec I'm going to have to pick you back
[2:04:18] up because you guys
[2:04:20] are we're like we need help
[2:04:24] now what chance do we
[2:04:27] have we got you just hold
[2:04:29] on I got the baptism of Holy Ghost no
[2:04:33] that don't mean you're going to
[2:04:35] heaven you can have the baptism of the
[2:04:38] Holy Ghost every hour in your
[2:04:42] life still be lost and go to
[2:04:46] hell that's a hard one
[2:04:50] why because it was just a
[2:04:53] baptism but it's got to be a baptism
[2:04:56] after baptism after baptism after
[2:04:59] baptism after baptism until the temple
[2:05:01] is
[2:05:02] ready for deity to come now and enthrone
[2:05:08] itself that's why we're after
[2:05:11] church we're after the infilling of the
[2:05:14] Holy
[2:05:15] Ghost I don't want just the
[2:05:17] baptism want the infilling of the Holy
[2:05:20] Ghost I want him I want to be his
[2:05:27] Abode I want to be his his
[2:05:32] address that's what I want I want him to
[2:05:35] know that I am his and he is
[2:05:39] mine all the baptism did to you was
[2:05:42] excite your outer
[2:05:45] man got your spirit all excited
[2:05:49] but it never went to the
[2:05:51] soul that's where the gene of God
[2:05:55] is in the soul and the Holy Ghost has
[2:05:59] got to come down into the
[2:06:02] soul so that it can Quicken
[2:06:05] it inside
[2:06:11] out now Glory here's what we we just
[2:06:14] come to this and then I'll stop John
[2:06:17] 14:20
[2:06:20] and at that
[2:06:21] day you'll
[2:06:24] know I am in my
[2:06:26] father in me and I in
[2:06:30] you I in
[2:06:33] you
[2:06:40] Tabernacle he that hath my Commandments
[2:06:43] and keepeth
[2:06:45] them he he is that loveth
[2:06:47] me and he that loveth me shall be loved
[2:06:50] of my
[2:06:51] father and I will love him and will
[2:06:54] manifest myself to
[2:06:58] him Judas saith unto
[2:07:01] him not
[2:07:03] scariot Lord how is it that thou Willl
[2:07:06] manifest thyself unto us and not unto
[2:07:10] the
[2:07:14] world Jesus answered and said unto
[2:07:17] him if a man love me he will keep my
[2:07:22] words and my father will love
[2:07:25] him and we will come unto
[2:07:29] him and make our Abode with
[2:07:34] him we will Tabernacle in
[2:07:39] him Church deity is no longer in
[2:07:44] heaven but say it again deity is no
[2:07:47] longer in heaven
[2:07:50] brother says deity is in
[2:07:55] you so if I were to ask this question
[2:07:58] brother will would you come to so if I
[2:08:00] were to ask you this
[2:08:03] question we need a baptism after
[2:08:08] baptism but answer me this
[2:08:11] question did Luther have the Holy
[2:08:17] Ghost
[2:08:21] that's a tricky one
[2:08:28] huh brother Jim says it's
[2:08:36] easy did Wesley have the Holy Ghost
[2:08:40] Wesley did the Pentecostals have the
[2:08:42] Holy
[2:08:44] Ghost and I'll tell you they had a
[2:08:47] baptism
[2:08:48] [Music]
[2:08:53] why because the prophet of God says
[2:08:57] this there were 200
[2:09:02] million demons
[2:09:05] Chargers that were Bound in the river
[2:09:09] Euphrates I'm coming to an end now 200
[2:09:13] million
[2:09:15] Chargers Bound in the river Euphrates
[2:09:19] imagine he says for 2,000
[2:09:23] years imagine those
[2:09:26] chargers for 2,000 years let us go let
[2:09:31] us go I want turn us
[2:09:33] loose not yet stay there those angels
[2:09:38] that were there stay there they were not
[2:09:41] to be loose till the end
[2:09:44] time you know where I'm going with this
[2:09:47] 200 million
[2:09:49] chargers at the
[2:09:51] mouth ready to takeen and then brother
[2:09:55] says they came against the Jews in a
[2:09:58] literal
[2:10:02] standpoint they were turned Loose by
[2:10:04] Stalin and
[2:10:06] Hitler Hitler and those were ready to
[2:10:09] tear them
[2:10:11] apart almost annihilated all these
[2:10:14] Jews but they could
[2:10:17] not
[2:10:19] I'm going to say it again they could not
[2:10:21] do it they were let loose after being
[2:10:25] bound for 2,000
[2:10:27] years brother brandham says the Holy
[2:10:31] Ghost was also Bound for 2000
[2:10:35] years he said not at the
[2:10:38] Euphrates but at the rivers of
[2:10:42] denominations so then if the Holy Ghost
[2:10:45] was
[2:10:46] bound for 2,000 years
[2:10:49] imagine the
[2:10:51] power imagine the power of the Holy
[2:10:54] Ghost when he was ready to release
[2:10:58] this what were they waiting for for a
[2:11:02] man to let
[2:11:05] deity come and dwell in
[2:11:08] him and if any man would open the door I
[2:11:14] will come into him and I'll stop with
[2:11:17] him he with me brother brandham says was
[2:11:21] not until the last or the end time
[2:11:26] message that finally loed the Holy
[2:11:31] Ghost it was in this
[2:11:33] time that a prophet rose on the
[2:11:37] scene it was a a son of
[2:11:40] man revealing the son of man doing what
[2:11:45] it was deity Tabernacles
[2:11:49] what to release the Holy
[2:11:52] Ghost it was no longer a
[2:11:56] baptism it was the person of the Holy
[2:12:00] Ghost coming on the
[2:12:02] scene loose for you and
[2:12:05] I that's why he says and it came those
[2:12:09] 200 million
[2:12:10] [Music]
[2:12:11] chargers they come in a spiritual
[2:12:16] standpoint against the bride
[2:12:19] but then he says later on Feast of the
[2:12:22] trumpets you know where I'm going later
[2:12:25] on he says he says but she'll be
[2:12:29] gone by the time they could ever do
[2:12:32] anything to
[2:12:34] her because the person of the Holy
[2:12:37] Ghost prepared a
[2:12:39] bride that through Christ the Holy Ghost
[2:12:44] we are the only
[2:12:47] people history of life to be able to
[2:12:51] call
[2:12:55] Jesus I don't know if that does anything
[2:12:57] for
[2:12:58] you we the only ones that could ever
[2:13:01] really call him
[2:13:03] Lord because the Holy Ghost was now let
[2:13:08] loose no man calls Jesus
[2:13:13] Lord except by the Holy
[2:13:16] Ghost and it's loose now
[2:13:19] he's loose with all his
[2:13:21] power he has raised the church he's
[2:13:24] uniting a church together because he's
[2:13:27] coming for her Hello everybody stand to

[2:13:46] experience
