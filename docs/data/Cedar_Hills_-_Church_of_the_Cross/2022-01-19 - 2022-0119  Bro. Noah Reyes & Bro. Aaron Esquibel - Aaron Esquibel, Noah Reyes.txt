thank our pastors this this evening samuel 12 [Music] m amen amen it says but when david saw that his servants whispered david perceived that the child was dead therefore david said unto his servants is the child dead and he said he is dead the endeavor arose from the earth and washed and anointed himself and changed his apparel and came into the house of the lord and worshiped and he came to his own house and when he required he set bread before him and he did eat then said his servants unto him what thing is this that thou has done thou didst fast and weep for the child while it was alive but when the child was dead thou didst rise and eats bread and he said while the child was yet alive i fasted and wept for i said who can tell whether god will be gracious to me that the child may live but now he is dead wherefore should i fast and i bring him back again i shall go to him but he shall not return to me. amen the lord has the blessings to the reading of the word you may be seated and i'd like to take as a title this this evening until the glory of god right and we notice david he's entered into prayer right he had gone into fasting and and the bible says he he had fasted for nearly seven days now and and the reason we we take the scripture we often expect for the lord to tell us yes in prayer we have this petition in our hearts and we expect for the lord to always tell us yes but we know that sometimes the lord tells us no no i don't know about you but there's been times where the lord tells me no no and it can be a difficult concept to grasp whenever we're in prayer or when we have a need upon our heart second corinthians 1 20 it says for all the promises of god in him are yea and in him amen and we'll stop there amen we read that first part of the verse and our faith goes to the roof all the promises unto the glory of god by us but sometimes we don't realize sometimes the needs that we have they don't always bring glory to the lord and you may ask but the problem is god knows the beginning to the end and when we think that we know better god is the one that knows best now if you keep reading that that that story there you see we read a small part of it i like what david did after david had committed this this terrible sin yet he was a man after god's own heart he gets up and he goes into the house of the lord and yet you go into the house of the lord and you worship and it says then they brought bread unto him after the lord against god shall the thing form say to him that formed it why has thou made me thus sometimes we we might have a good job lined up and we pray lord this job would be awesome for me you don't know what the future holds for you right i was speaking to a cousin of mine and we we were kind of talking about courtship yesterday you know often times you know we think oh lord this girl she's the one for me i mean she's is a good christian girl yes don't you want me to marry a good christian girl sure he does but maybe the lord doesn't want her to marry you you might make her life miserable right we have to be honest with ourselves so we let's get to this here for a moment how many know that the abc's of the bible someone can shout it out that's right always believe christ we could hold on to that that would keep us out of a lot of trouble right sometimes we have questions in our minds we have certain doubts and if we were to hold on to that always believe christ that the lord would reveal to us those questions the devil he comes to take advantage in those moments and he comes and he tries to plant some seed of discrepancy he wants to place unbelief in your life [Music] and we know we know the message says unbelief is sin [Music] where brother branham says always believe christ to know him is life so we want to know him is that right it looks great things are going right do we turn the other cheek and say as our lord jesus christ lord forgive them for they know not what they do what a statement from our lord jesus christ in the ultimate act of love the lord utters these words forgive them they don't know what they do and many times we think these these uh these attacks come from our enemies but what happens when it comes from our friends amigo and it comes from our own brothers and one shall say unto him what are these wounds in thy hands and he shall answer those with which i was wounded in the house of my friends we begin to pray for all these things and then suddenly our brother this brother he's always late this is just the lord trying you yes what happens when we can't cope what happens when we can't cope a backpack of circumstances in the book of james it says and at the end when sen is finished bring his first death brother will mention something during the the panel on on sunday mingo where we we want to change people why do you do that brother and what your brother is struggling with hermano sure that was easy for you to overcome but in this other thing over here it was between life or death you had to fight hard to overcome that right so so we try to change people yet we desperate is god which worketh in you both to will and to do of surrenders itself unto the will of god as paul said it is no longer i that lives it and and lord if it takes a broken heart that you need it isn't because the lord wants to punish you when when he says no it's because he loves you right he knows what's best for your life you gethsemane he said lord if this cup can pass but lord not my will your will be done whom god would make known what is the riches of the glory of his mystery of this mystery among the gentiles which is christ in you the hope of glory gloria john 16 21 a woman when she is in travail has sorrow because her hour has come but as soon as she is delivered of the child she remembers no more the anguish for the joy that a man is born into the world whenever you there's times where you see your brother or he's going through a rough time but as brother branham teaches us as brother will said we can't change people we try and force them to to change but what we are able to change brother brown says we're creators of atmospheres it changes the atmosphere it begins to create an atmosphere an atmosphere in that fellowship yes it begins to sanctify vienna this will be our last scripture here second corinthians in our hope of you as steadfast knowing that as you are partakers of the sufferings so shall ye be also of the constellation respect for and at the end of it all all the glory will go toward to our god to the author to the finisher and the giver of life amen god bless you amen [Applause] amen god bless you all this evening sure is good to be in the house of the lord give one to the lord this evening like to thank our pastor for giving me the opportunity to speak here this evening as i just read this title here i get inspired we're just going to start at verse 14 to save some time when you're happy man meet all those online i know there's many that are in their homes sick afflicted but as the word of god goes forth this evening i pray that you reach out and claim what's yours verse 14 reads and he took the mantle of elijah that fell from him and smote the waters and said where is the lord god of elijah and when he had also smitten the waters they parted hither and thither and elisha went over it hey man what is so how many remember the title from sunday's the fingerprints of god amen [Music] we know that god vindicated his prophet by taking his picture with him amen and this just goes to say yes this is god saying you know i'll i'll get man's best expert to verify this photo now what's so interesting about mr george lacy here george lacy not just that he worked for the fbi no solamente que trabajo and the only conclusion that he can come what a beautiful thing that is when god can put his fingerprint upon our lives so as our pastor was speaking on sunday domingo and he was hitting on the point of timothy and paul pablo and he was saying how you know paul knew that timothy had a gift of faith inside of him and there came a point where in timothy's life you are excuse me he goes on to say on sunday that what a thing it is when a son or daughter of god can recognize that they do have that faith that maybe their fathers or their grandparents had [Music] and maybe elijah had uh had noticed that elisha had a gift inside of him maybe elisha knew that he had a gift inside of him but maybe that gift hadn't been stirred up yeah [Music] tonight that there's some shaking going on but i believe elijah found himself in a in a tough situation the one that he looked at for so long is [Applause] that word's gotta be inside of our house okay let's try to throw the word at your problem you gotta live it you've gotta be backed up is and that's why i appreciate you the job that brother julian is doing what is he doing he's not just getting a bunch of stories no what he's doing is getting a bunch of blueprints together maybe there's some elijah's in here they just need to be a little bit inspired i believe each one of you have a gift just sitting on the bench it's no coincidence coincidence yeah satan two is trying to stir gifts is he knows it with our children whatever you have in your hand you've got to use it for the honor and glory and we stopped at a travel center and normally i don't like coffee from gas stations it tastes like water and it's just yes but we were on the road and peros the uh um cafe escudo i was like damn they got a pretty good setup so i go ahead and give me the coffee and i get in the car i take one sip i was thinking man that's how christians have become today religion i want to serve a living resurrection touched by the feeling of my opinion i gotta know i have a direct line with you yes so this takes me to my little testimony here yes a couple weeks back my dad and i decided to go on a deer hunt i had two great opportunities a really nice buck and i just didn't sell the deal with him you know and so i had asked the lord that he would you know give me a buck and it didn't happen so we came home that weekend and i was just thinking you know what maybe i just blew the opportunities do you feel like the situation could have been any better it's not it builds so [Music] and he wasn't going to stop you know eva so i kind of gave out a little grunt he stopped and looked at me for about two seconds and it looked like he was a good shot [Music] long story short i didn't find the deer no no no yeah i know i had hit him because he was leaving little drops of blood thank you very much and so i pray to the lord i said lord and so we spent that whole day looking for that book he is so it was the the next day right when we're leaving the place that we're hunting we turn the corner and he was just standing there he and i was 14 yards away from this buck by the way the first time i had just nicked him maybe just enough to just draw some blood out of his brisket area here la primera and i just got tunnel vision because i was caught up in the moment in the moment i noticed there's a big branch hanging out about 10 feet in front of me this is it you gave me another opportunity this book is mine well i didn't find the buck so then this last weekend we go out again spend all day looking for the hurt find the deer again but the buck's not in there yeah i told my dad well let's go ahead and leave because i want to be back by youth prayer that night so we're leaving where we're hunting and i even had to take a double look yeah and i wanted my dad to take him so we parked the vehicle and we get out and i'm even filming my dad and my dad could have easily made this shot it was 48 yards and the buck's just standing there slowly making his way into the open camera he doesn't even know we're there all of a sudden he just takes off running out of nowhere he wasn't spooked he was just no no we're thinking he smelled some dough here and he just takes off running well before that my dad had taken a shot at him so i was standing there my dad went after him and i was standing there with my phone i was like well i better establish it i better grab my bow and just go in there maybe there's some another buck with him and so i start you know walking real quietly into some thick brush and there's nothing between me and him he's about 80 yards away would look at me and i would just freeze and you look back at my dad and i just start you know sneaking in real quiet so i got to about 48 50 yards and i said lord this is as far as as i'm going to get on this deer um i just pray and he looked right at me again and he must not have seen me because i was just standing there and right when he turned his ears i light a narrow flag and it nailed him well he takes off running island jumps into some private property and he cleared about a seven foot fence so i was thinking man maybe so i went to find some blood and there was no blood if we uh and so my dad said well wait here i'll leave my bow and i'll go in there and see if i can at least spot him and see if he's bedded or what's going on inspire my dad to go just the right way so he doesn't pressure him too far inspira correct those of you who hunt no a wounded deer will just keep going and going and just let them be lost there was coyotes all over the place i was expecting the deer just to come m and i just i just broke down lord you heard my prayer and what was more tremendous about it my dad said that the deer was actually trying to make his way to and so i was just so overjoyed that the lord would even hear my prayer at that moment and i never doubted that the lord don't hear my prayers i just want to give all honor to the lord jesus christ i want to thank you all for for listening this evening and i pray that the lord just continue to bless you always [Applause] gracious and heavenly father father de gracia lord we just want to tell you this evening that we love you lord i pray that just something that was said tonight by your son noah portugal it rises up that indignation inside of me to see the bride sick lord
