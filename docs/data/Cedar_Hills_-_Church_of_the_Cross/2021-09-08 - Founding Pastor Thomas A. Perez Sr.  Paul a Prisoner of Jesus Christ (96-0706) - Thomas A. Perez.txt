========================================

[Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] amen may the lord bless you this evening and it's good to be in the house of the lord we're happy for the visitors amen and like we heard extremely happy to see my brother know david with his wife which is my baby sister and her daughter go baby yeah baby and we're just happy to have you here we have um we have a good group tonight but there's a lot of people missing and somewhere in the doctor somewhere going on a trip and others are on a trip and we'll just pray for each and every one of them also before we get into the message i'd like for us not to forget to pray that we're having a hard time getting the ticket to brother charles and boy in ghana africa and the reason for it all the lines are out of commission there in ghana and the whole country i that's what i hear and i don't know when they're gonna repair them or when they're gonna have them ready but as long as they don't have a mouth facts and whatever we're not gonna be able to to get the ticket to him but just pray that god's will will be done amen amen i have a little rebound brother roger here or anything so we want to open our bibles and i hope i pronounce this book right sometimes i have a hard time pronouncing some of these words but after the book of titus and simply going to read the first verse amen how many love the lord amen amen i'd like to touch a little bit tonight on paul a prisoner of christ and it reads this way exactly what i said paul a prisoner of jesus christ would you all read it with me paul a prisoner of jesus christ what what a thing to be a prisoner he's he's not a prisoner of just anybody but he's a prisoner of jesus christ let us pray our heavenly father we are indeed thankful this evening lord for the opportunity once more to be able to be assembled together we calling it a privilege we know the times will come when this privilege will be taken away from us but as long as we have this privilege it is an honor or to come together and worship you together may this be a revelation to your people that someday they'll look for fellowship and they won't be able to find it they'll look for somebody that just believes the word they they won't be able to find it all you can hear is somebody stepping by your side and shaking their feet stomping their feet a little bit you know that their believers holding on the battle is getting harder every day it's waxing hot hotter it seems like it's getting to degrees of when those hebrew children were in the fiery furnace it just keeps getting hotter and hotter the lord in in spite of all this we hang on because we have a promise and it's really not us holding on more but it's you holding on to us we pray heavenly father this evening that you will be with us and just let your spirit flow through each one of us lord and may we understand that we're not here in church just to pass a few hours and we're here because we're concerned we've been convinced now we're concerned about our welfare of the welfare of the people lord we're here to try lord with everything we have in our power lord to make it it takes you lord we understand that man can do it alone man is not able to do it it takes the holy spirit and i pray dear father that you will quicken this to us and be with us lord and help us father along the way heal the sick of the afflicted in jesus name and you may be seated as you're saying turn your bibles over to the third chapter of the book of the ephesians and it also speaks about paul being a prisoner and he says this in verse 1 for this cause i call the prisoner of jesus christ for you gentiles now in uh the have uh earphones been handed out to spanish yeah yes yes all right i want to make sure that everybody gets to eat but you know it's it's quite a word a pr a prisoner of christ now in some of the letters of paul it says paul an apostle of jesus christ in other letters it says paul a servant of jesus christ but when he writes this letter to filament he addresses it as paul a prisoner of christ and when he wrote this letter paul was in jail he was in jail and and he could well understand by his position what the word man that when he was surrounded by mars you know what how jail looks but he could only be free if someone made him free or let him free we have incidents in the bible where uh man of god and mostly all men of god have either served in jail at one time or the other john the baptist paul silas and peter and what have you and john take him to the isle of patmos and uh they were all there under in what we would call today federal prisons but here is a man put in jail because of what he believed and uh it go very well with a regular trend on what he delivered the regular trend there was the orthodox religion and it was the turning of the corner of the dispensation but it was very hard for them to see it and the high priest they they thought that this group of people called christians were a cult so paul being one of them was very a very persecuted man very persecuted by religion and federal government under roman rule we understand that but here we find paul in such a such a predicament in iran in a prison and he's saying a prisoner of christ now i don't believe and you know you know why i say that that i don't believe that paul was addressing this letter to philemon about his present condition his present condition was that he was in jail he wasn't referring to that but i believe he was referring to his being his spirit his will being a prisoner to the lord jesus christ and uh let me just before i get started how many of you would love like to be a prisoner of jesus christ don't be so hasty in raising your hands it's not easy to be a prisoner to be behind bars but like i said i don't i do not believe that here when he said a prisoner of jesus christ he is referring to his physical being but he is referring to his will first of all to get started we understand that as men and women we are under a free moral agency and it has to be that way for you to choose whether you want to serve or you don't want to serve whether you want to follow death or you want to follow life and it has to be upon the same basis that he placed adam and eve and if it isn't under those bases well then god isn't just but god being just he places you and i understand i want you to hold that word because later this passage of scripture might confuse you a little bit it confuses and dumbfounds theologians such as such as to femoral agency well in criminal agency you have a choice but we'll find out later what choice paul had when he became a prisoner amen and it gets quite tremendous when you when you read this now right and wrong is set before us just like i said adam and eve and the whole human race was under what we call the penalty of death we we were we were condemned to die we had no way out but god came down in the form of a man to take away that sting of death and place under free moral agency he placed on a free knowledge agency for you and i to make a decision now decision uh is decisions are hard to make we we we stand like in the valley of decisions and man we get up in the morning we have to decide whether we're going to put on our socks or we're not that's why you see a lot of people that don't wear socks they don't want to put them on hey you gotta you gotta decide whether you're gonna wash your face and comb your hairs while you find other people never comb their hair they decided to come their hair and you're gonna decide whether you're to eat breakfast or you're not then you've got every minute that passes by there are decisions to be made it's time for church we have to decide whether we want to go to church or we don't want to go to church right you have you have a right to choose yes you don't have to come to church people say you should be in church you don't have to go to church you're a female agent you can stay home and watch i love lucy but we choose to be here we we are i believe we're all here because we wanted to be here right well that's either a free moral agency and you choose to serve god you choose to serve god you you know the the church world knows no matter what church they go to the anyone that is called christian knows that jesus christ died on the cross is that right or is that wrong anyone that is called a christian knows that jesus christ died on the cross now they have to decide if they're going to follow him they have to decide what church they're going to go to they have to make a decision what they're going to believe amen and you have to decide it's a decision and nobody can make for you you got to make it by yourself you can bring your children to church but when they grow old or get older they'll go if they want to and usually they don't have a new birthday in the church they're going to go out into the world no matter how much you bring them to church they got to get that new birthday amen but we find out that each one of us must choose we must choose death or life do you know that life or and death in our lives our lives are just a shadow and you know what brings a shadow is a certain degree of darkness and a certain degree of light man that's what creates a shadow so we walk in the valley of the shadow of death but the real light we see what is called cosmo life this this cosmo we we have access to the cosmoline but but that there's another light which is god's life that is not that's not cosmo that's zoe and we've heard that over and over now when that light is present darkness cleans there's no there's no darkness that can stand there there's no darkness can stand there when it in cosmo you can bring a shadow it creates a shadow through different things and a certain degree of darkness with light creates the shadow but you can be soundlessly and you can wake up in the middle of the night and if you happen to see the light of god you see zoe it it has no boundaries as far as darkness it makes darkness go away and that's something great have you ever seen a light i have many people have some never seen life but i've seen i've seen a light and the greatest light i've seen is the light that has struck my heart now your life my life your life will prove what side you're on your proof outside you're on now reason i i make this statement is to maybe amplify a little bit on the condition of the apostle paul now paul [Music] as far as being a christian he was not a christian paul was a jew but hadn't come into christianity he hadn't seen this thing about christianity yet paul believed there was a god he he he served god his way [Music] you understand catch all this he served god his way he was a very trained man he was a scholar but the life that he had proved what side he was on paul had never come in contact with the light paul had gone to to school from the age of eight years old to the age of 35 he had studied under a great man like he manial [Music] he was a great man he was a god-fearing man but he hadn't seen the light he didn't know anything about jesus all he knew that there was a set called christians that followed a man that was here on earth called jesus that's all he knew so the light that is that he had showed what side he was on he was on the side of the manual and the sanhedrin that was paul on the road most of the new testament the letters but in in seeing this you think i'm stuttering but there's a reason for it reserving a little bit here but in studying this life of paul and how he was a prisoner is something to behold as christians we we sometimes judge our lives by how much power we seem to possess or by how many miracles can be done in our ministry [Music] or by how much knowledge we have of the word so you you find you find theologians throughout the country the bible bookstores are full of books on commentaries by different men in their viewpoint of how they think things should be run they have their school they have their thought they have their ideas they have their theology on how things should be run gives you their opinion on how things should be run paul was trained under that on how things should be run paul was a very ambitious man aside from being very smart and in intelligent person trained under gamil paul was a man that had ambitions and one of the ambitions that he had was to someday be a priest and someday maybe be the high priest that was his ambition so paul had favor with the sanhedrin he found favor with the clergy of his day but his life proved what side he was on and at that age when he had studied and he was under this clergy he was a very well trusted man that's the reason that they gave paul the power and documents to go to damascus and you read it in the bible how he went to damascus and he went to damascus he went because he was given authority to bind to bring back to jerusalem these little groups called christians bring them back so paul went to damascus and not only that but he was also given the authority to heal anyone that resisted him he had authority to kill so paul he thought he was doing god a service he was trained he believed in god he chose to follow god but there's one thing that paul had never encountered he had never encountered that purifier he knew nothing about christianity he knew about god as far as the hebrew law as far as the hebrew he said i am a hebrew of hebrews born of the tribal benjamin circumcised the eighth day he knew the law he was a zealous man but the time came when paul going and thinking he was doing kind of service he takes he gets on his on his horse and he goes with his man and he goes toward damascus but he's to his surprise that as he was nearing damascus finally not not a shadow not a cosmic light amen but a light from heaven a bitter fire persecuted by me and he said lord pour thou he said i am jesus my whom thou persecuted you know what jesus did to him you want to be a prisoner of jesus christ you know what jesus did to him he blinded him yes he put his eyes out yeah jesus we served put his eyes out and said paul we're solved he said you are to go to a street whole street i got a straight job you've got to let a prophet come and note your eyes paul when he was there how the holy spirit came upon in an eye of the prophet he came and anointed him and we find it as he had anointed paul that paul's paul's eyes were open to something that he had never seen before he knew about god to a degree to a certain degree you couldn't touch him concerning the law you you look at his books and read his books on to the romans the corinthians thessalonians hebrew and i said hebrew because there are some theologians don't think that he wrote the book of hebrews but i believe he wrote the secret hebrews and so on so how he wrote letters most of them dictated by a man well he would dictate they would write for him but he would write these letters and paul how he expounds her the the the hebrew law and he he says zealous concerning the law he said no one was more zealous than i was so paul was a tremendous tremendous man and i i find an interesting thing here that that uh and i could attribute to my life as far as religion we we're all born with religion one form or the other we all come from different backgrounds whether catholic presbyterian protestant whatever and we come and we we know what our fathers taught us we we love god because we we we've learned there is a god and we learn to love him to a certain degree but as far as really being apprehended a lot of people haven't been apprehended by this thing so they remain religious but paul was apprehended and when he his eyes were open i believe that that paul attended a lot of the services of a man called peter and he would sit there and hear him and he said this is tremendous the way he places this why gamaliel never placed it like this well there may not be nothing about this because this was the start of christianity yes and the other orthodox ways the religion didn't show this it pointed as a type to a deliverer but when the deliverer came israel never knew him israel never accepted him just a handful bible says about 120 but they began to grow they began to grow and that's what frightened the jewish people the sanhedrin the priests and everything that they had to put a stop to all of this but here we find paul he said this is tremendous until one day paul wouldn't take it no more and he says i've got to find out for myself all these things why why he intercepted why god did not permit me to fulfill my ambition you know what ambition is it means a desire to have honor or power or position such as in a career it's a desire that's from webster's and in this he went to the desert we believe he went to the desert of arabia man he studied for three and a half years and one day he said i come to the visions and the revelations of the lord jesus christ and how the lord comes to him in such a way that the ambition that was in him and let's face it we all have ambition to do things somebody had an ambition because there's people without ambition some people have demolished no objective in life why they're alive why they're here i'm a christian i'm i'm supposed to go to church and warm a bench all i know about god is more adventurous amen can say amen that's the truth no ambition but this man had a bishop that's why he went to damascus but when that light hit him it changed paul or saul which his name was given then from saul to paul and the lord says i'll show you how much you have to suffer you will suffer for my name it's easy i tell people it's easy to go to church i don't want to go to church it's easy to pick times it's easy to give your offering it's hard when [Music] you come across this line and something more is demanded of you you have you you hear young people especially especially well i'm going to go to school i'm going to be a teacher i'm going to be i'm going to be a musician i'm going to be a great salesman i'm going to be this or that well that's their ambition that's what their ambitions drive into and our ambitions i had ambitions there was things i wanted to do you know there are many many times to be a pastor is not easy there's many many times you you feel like going away from it you feel you feel like getting away from it all because it's hard very hard to minister and not just minister but mainly to be a pastor i've been a pastor almost 27 years and it ain't getting no easier but there's one thing experience and with the lord it helps us along the way to be able to cope with the situation so it's not easy so then would it be easy for for a man like me just to forget about it and go get my barber tunes working hours like you know and go home and take it easy it would be easy very easy people work eight hours and they go oh i'm so tired i'm trying to hit it for 24 see how tired you are for you can't sleep for the whole burn of the church and people is upon you and it gets hard but how can a man do that is the question how can a man do that except he be a prisoner amen and and here is where i begin to see this portion of scripture that i look at it and uh i see paul being a prisoner he's not talking about being in a in a little jail which he was but he's not speaking about that he was a prisoner to his will he had a will he had ambition he had in him something that he wanted to excel he wanted to be a priest and maybe a high priest when jesus comes across him you understand me jesus comes and the light comes yes ask you a question was he a free roll agent when jesus called in right wow think about it before you answer was he a free moral agent could he choose no god knew that he had already chosen to serve god and point number one man point number two is that god knew that paul even though he was intelligent didn't know how to serve god so god apprehended him he arrested him man that's why he says in the book of philippians for which i have been apprehended or arrested it wasn't free moral agency no more my my mind it was god showing mercy to a man called paul and in his mercy he places a yoke on him and fatters and he was chained where paul could not no more do his will but it was the will of god that he had to do god led paul he led him with a harness and folding so that he could go to the gentiles do you think that a jew would go to a gentile paul he didn't want to go to the gentiles he said i've never eaten anything that's that's that's uh filthy common nothing of this i'm never in these things but what did the lord tell you what god has cleaned let no man call unclean man jews didn't associate with gentiles they're called dogs and here peter had to be given a vision and then the same vision was given that was given to the the tenor it was the same thing that peter understood that god had opened the way for the gentiles but the gentiles still was left without knowledge of the lord jesus christ so god had to arrest every hand of them that loved god but didn't know how to serve him and let's get ahold of him because let me tell you one thing you think it's man seeking for god never does a man seek for god he's got seeking men adam adam where are they as far as choosing to go to church and serving god sure a man under that free moral agency does that but when you're apprehended by the lord jesus christ where you're taken from your comfort zone you have a comfort zone and you don't want to move from this comfort zone because it's easy to go with a trend and be in a comfort zone but when god ruffles those feathers of that nest makes you move and why do you do it because he's got chains on you chains of love you love him so much that you just want to keep on keeping on when things get higher in the church when things get unbearable in the church when you see man and woman pretending to be christians living the life they leave and whatever and it gets so hard sure you feel like running away but a true shepherd won't run the hiding will run but what makes you stand because you have so much knowledge no sir because you are a prisoner you are becoming prisoner of the lord jesus christ amen and he places a yoke upon you and he says my yoke is easy and my bird is light sometimes i wonder because the load sometimes it ain't light but i know the word is right so i have to go back and put this carnal man to the side and say it's not you son it's jesus notice another point there was [Music] paul persecuting jesus literally when i say literally i mean this was jesus christ in corporal form then who was all persecuted he was persecuting his church the body of believers and jesus said that's enough don't you touch them that's enough you're not supposed to persecute this people my name is in this you're persecuting me paul when you touch these people it is i it is i nobody else and when we see see that and we see the road and the troubles that we have on the road and everything else we know it's got to be jesus and how many of you would love to just have those chains of love placed upon your heart but here's what's going to happen here's what's going to happen you got to go or you don't want to go did you hear me you've got to go where you don't want to go you've got to do something but you don't want to do it you gotta say things sometimes that you don't want to say and when the people throw at you it's not you looking for that it's jesus it hasn't changed since the day it remains the same man amen what what a tremendous thing that that he just addresses this paul a prisoner of christ i am a prisoner a prisoner that is bound in chains of love he loved jesus so much when he got the revelation of what it was that his chains didn't mean nothing why did god change him what if god took his chains away from you don't you think that you would go back to your ambition fulfill your ambition right so it becomes not no more will the decisions come short just a little thought what would it be tremendous to know that he loves us how much do you love him how much do you find against him would you stand to your feet how much did we find all right how much do we do if he told you right now [Music] go to a certain place or i have a word for you to do would you go all [Music] people ask me at times why do you go to different places i have to why do you do this i have to do it do you have to do it yes i have to do it no you're a free moral agent brother oh no i used to be a formal agent i'm not no more informal agency my will is his will whatever he says there we do [Music] less than that and until we get to that place yes we have chosen to serve god god we love god but our knowledge and the revelation of jesus christ still hasn't come out all right we can do be like the rich young ruler know the commandments that's fine he said but one thing i liked [Music] pick up your cross [Music] he could do it he could do anything else sell the goods give it to the poor take out your cross follow me no sir his ambition was too great in his possessions [Music] let us not fall into that let us be willing to give god what is god and to serve him and he know that we love him choose to love him [Music] i want you to serve mexico [Music] because your ambition leads you do other things but if you haven't you say yes before you let me i will follow why because i am [Music] get up get away and get by just playing church coming to church and saying we love god by all people most old people love god but one day you say you said why do you say you love me but yet you don't do what i tell you to do how can you say that that you love me the lord is i look to the scriptures i find myself sometimes one people lay in the balance and i say lord it's not my will lord but let your will be done be lord in my heart not just a savior but lord come into my heart lord and lead me wherever you need there i will follow and as we grow more along the road knowing that you're always there with us a lot what a revelation that this my brother paul god has as he wrote to philip he said paul i paul a prisoner of jesus christ i am found by feathers of love i have a hardness upon me where he leads me towards the gentiles for long the jews refused to hear the gospel so i turned to the gentiles seeing that they find themselves not worthy to receive such greater message lord in this end time it has been no different we've seen the evening lights come seen a prophet visit our generation people say there ain't no more problems there ain't no more of this but as i look to your word you say people on the side keep on the world knows nothing about this they fight there's so much fighting on the world point of our church is falling apart there's one thing that remains your word shall never fail because in the beginning it was the word the word was with god and the word was god and the word was made flesh and he dropped among us lord what a thing when you say the world see us be no more but you shall see me for i personal pronoun i will be with you even in you unto the end lord nurse nothing can take the place of your presence lord and when you come over our way and we see that lives shine about us more and the people look to that they say foolishness the world calls foolish and what the people call heresy so worship i the god of my fathers i thank you dear lord and i love you and i bless you bless the lord o my soul and all that is within me bless bless each one here tonight we are in your presence your presence ever with us lord what a thing that it to not our will and we can understand that become that prisoner fall in prison
