[48:44] you would open your scriptures
[48:58] we want to see where the lord takes us
[49:00] today
[49:03] amen we if you can be so kind to turn
[49:06] into your scriptures to hebrews the
[49:08] fifth chapter
[49:12] where do you stand this morning
[49:22] and everyone is asking where do you
[49:23] stand on certain issues
[49:28] everywhere you go where do you stand
[49:31] well the answer is simple
[49:34] it depends on your maturity
[49:38] amen how many believe that we're at the
[49:40] end
[49:42] how many believe that we are that fruit
[49:43] at the top
[49:46] that has been ripening and should have
[49:47] been ripened
[49:51] how many believe that you are a mature
[49:54] son and daughter of god
[50:09] is the state of being fully developed
[50:15] let's see where we go hebrews chapter 5
[50:17] and verse 12.
[50:22] for when
[50:24] for the time ye ought to be teachers
[50:29] ye have need that one teach you again
[50:33] which be the first principles of the
[50:36] oracles of god
[50:38] and are become such as
[50:40] have need of milk and
[50:42] not of strong meat
[50:48] is necessary
[51:01] for everyone that useth milk is
[51:03] unskillful in the word of righteousness
[51:07] for he is a babe meaning
[51:10] he is not mature at all
[51:21] but strong meat belongs to them that are
[51:24] of full age
[51:31] once again how many are
[51:34] of full age
[51:35] sunday that's plenty to see your hands
[51:39] full age means that it's
[51:41] that you're mature
[51:44] even those who by reason of use have
[51:46] their senses exercised
[51:49] to discern both good
[51:52] and evil
[51:54] foreign
[52:04] your senses have been exercised to
[52:06] discern both good and evil
[52:12] one more scripture hebrews the sixth
[52:14] chapter it's the very next the next
[52:16] chapter
[52:19] watch watch how paul goes in from
[52:22] you should by this time you should be
[52:25] teachers
[52:29] talking about milk and then the meat
[52:33] and then he starts hebrews 6 with this
[52:35] wonderful
[52:37] scripture therefore leaving the
[52:39] principles
[52:40] of the doctrine of christ
[52:42] let us go on unto perfection
[52:58] little teaching here this morning
[53:03] therefore leaving the principles of the
[53:05] doctrine of christ
[53:11] unto perfection
[53:18] the word perfection there is teliotis
[53:23] which means the state of completeness is
[53:40] it comes from the base word talios
[53:44] it means that you're wanting or you lack
[53:46] nothing
[53:49] that you are a grown adult you are
[53:52] mature
[53:56] now we got that out of the way now let's
[53:58] go on and see where we are at
[54:01] as far as maturity yeah
[54:05] how many of you believe that you're once
[54:07] again that you are a mature person
[54:12] let me see the young people
[54:15] because sometimes we think that when we
[54:17] get to the age of 18
[54:21] somehow some way
[54:32] we think sometimes like that this has
[54:34] been some oh i can't wait till i get to
[54:35] be 18. oh no puerto
[54:49] right
[55:01] it makes us reflect upon our our lives
[55:06] let's be honest with ourselves and let's
[55:07] be honest with god this this morning
[55:13] that's what the holy spirit is after
[55:15] today
[55:18] for us to make an assessment of our
[55:20] maturity
[55:24] and since our emotional development
[55:28] is not necessarily on track with our
[55:31] natural age no necessary
[55:46] necessary
[55:48] because you might be 50 or 60 years old
[55:51] and still not be mature in a lot of
[55:52] things
[55:56] oh it is in the spiritual
[55:58] spiritual that the number of years
[56:00] you've been going to church
[56:04] the number of years that you have been
[56:05] in the message
[56:08] doesn't necessarily reflect our
[56:10] spiritual maturity not necessarily
[56:14] somehow
[56:24] sometimes we're just over ripe
[56:27] sobre maduros
[56:31] let that one sink in for a little bit
[56:35] i've been in the message for 30 40 50
[56:37] years
[56:40] not equal maturity
[56:57] maybe even that we get married finally
[57:01] that we should be on the cover of mature
[57:04] magazines
[57:09] because we have our first child all of a
[57:11] sudden we we should be mature
[57:17] that doesn't equal maturity either
[57:21] i'm here to try to help you and help
[57:23] myself
[57:26] believe me i get a good gospel whip and
[57:29] whenever the holy spirit comes into the
[57:31] room
[57:35] as i go down this list
[57:38] put on your spiritual
[57:50] and let's see
[57:51] if we're really mature and in what areas
[57:53] we're mature
[57:56] go on this little journey with me
[57:59] let's see really where we're at because
[58:01] we we act like we're real mature
[58:05] let's start with those young people
[58:07] writing notes
[58:08] god bless you
[58:11] immature people are not capable of being
[58:13] quiet
[58:18] you might not like some of these but
[58:20] that's okay
[58:24] the bible says that you must study to be
[58:27] quiet
[58:30] first thessalonians 4 11.
[58:33] james 1 26
[58:35] santiago
[58:37] if any man among you seem to be
[58:39] religious
[58:42] and bridleth not his tongue
[58:45] no reference
[58:46] but deceiveth his own heart
[59:03] for in many things james 3 2
[59:06] santiago tresdos in many things we
[59:08] offend all
[59:12] but if any man
[59:14] offend not in word the same is a perfect
[59:17] man
[59:20] is perfect and able also to bridle the
[59:23] whole body
[59:27] so it's possible to be perfect
[59:30] don't you get tired of the same old
[59:32] thing from people
[59:35] well nobody's perfect
[59:38] let me see how many of you have ever
[59:39] used that phrase
[59:41] nobody's perfect no
[59:44] we all make mistakes
[59:46] usually the ones that say that are the
[59:47] ones that just made a mistake
[59:51] that's their way of trying to get out of
[59:52] it
[59:53] nobody's perfect
[59:55] but if you can hold your tongue
[1:00:09] how do you respond to adversity you
[1:00:12] gotta you gotta bring those questions to
[1:00:14] yourself
[1:00:18] do you lash back every time someone
[1:00:20] tells you something negative
[1:00:24] negative the way that we respond to
[1:00:27] things
[1:00:29] shows a lot about our character
[1:00:33] it shows a lot about our maturity
[1:00:37] when someone speaks evil of you
[1:00:49] nobody needs to answer the question
[1:00:51] don't be looking at anybody else
[1:01:08] word
[1:01:11] how do we respond when someone speaks
[1:01:13] evil of us
[1:01:17] usually the immature person the person
[1:01:21] will gather all that they know
[1:01:30] this happens in the churches quite
[1:01:32] frequently
[1:01:37] i don't think they like this message
[1:01:40] let me see if i find another message
[1:01:44] that's okay but i want you to hit home
[1:01:46] today
[1:01:48] because we're at the end
[1:02:05] is that we respond the same way
[1:02:09] that we did 20 30 years ago
[1:02:13] in the church
[1:02:15] that's why he's saying when by now you
[1:02:18] should be teachers
[1:02:21] we're having to go back and teach the
[1:02:22] same things
[1:02:26] why are we do we still respond the same
[1:02:28] way
[1:02:30] has there not been any growth
[1:02:45] [Music]
[1:03:01] insulting someone else
[1:03:06] that doesn't happen with us
[1:03:13] you're immature
[1:03:26] immature people don't think about the
[1:03:28] consequences of their actions
[1:03:34] why
[1:03:35] because they don't think of anyone else
[1:03:36] but themselves
[1:03:40] isn't eternal life
[1:03:42] to live for
[1:03:57] seem so much more outstanding than
[1:03:59] everyone else's sobres
[1:04:03] they don't know how to complement
[1:04:05] someone else
[1:04:08] they use whatever they can use
[1:04:12] their success su exito their physical
[1:04:15] being susan
[1:04:17] they are anthony
[1:04:18] stick
[1:04:22] that's why they all they
[1:04:23] that's why they only measure themselves
[1:04:26] up against people that they think are
[1:04:28] inferior to them
[1:04:33] and yet in all points it shows them it
[1:04:36] shows really that they're insecure about
[1:04:38] themselves
[1:04:45] are you with me
[1:04:47] okay
[1:04:48] making sure
[1:04:49] again
[1:04:51] the lord blesses someone with something
[1:04:53] in the church
[1:04:56] and right away the immature person wants
[1:04:58] to compare the media
[1:05:02] but you should see the one i got
[1:05:18] praise god
[1:05:23] and then most people even they don't
[1:05:25] even say
[1:05:26] when when they see you with something
[1:05:29] they would rather see you without the
[1:05:31] preview
[1:05:33] and they'll even go as far to say oh
[1:05:35] well somebody i know has a better one
[1:05:36] than better truck than that it is
[1:05:41] all you see across their forehead
[1:05:43] immaturity
[1:05:46] and you look at them you're like
[1:05:48] the
[1:06:01] i have to look in the mirror first
[1:06:02] before i
[1:06:30] what
[1:06:41] just ask yourself where do i stand in
[1:06:44] all this
[1:07:11] because it's always someone else's fault
[1:07:15] yes even in the church
[1:07:19] all these things
[1:07:21] i know
[1:07:22] you'll say
[1:07:23] yo
[1:07:23] yo pastor
[1:07:28] immature people
[1:07:31] do not have the ability or the
[1:07:33] discipline to forgive anyone else
[1:07:38] immature people are always looking for
[1:07:40] an excuse
[1:07:43] immature people are always looking for
[1:07:45] someone to support them
[1:07:51] but they do not want to ever support
[1:07:52] anyone else
[1:08:05] make the same mistakes over and over and
[1:08:08] over and over again
[1:08:13] hello everybody hola
[1:08:16] why
[1:08:17] because they're not disciplined enough
[1:08:19] to do anything about it
[1:08:36] you're lucky we got a good interpreter
[1:08:38] he said he wants it to go on
[1:08:41] the writer states
[1:08:46] maturity is patient la madures
[1:08:49] espaciente
[1:08:52] it can endure without complaining
[1:08:58] james 1 4 says but let patience have her
[1:09:02] perfect work
[1:09:03] santiago
[1:09:16] but it's not saying that being perfect
[1:09:17] you'll never make a mistake
[1:09:32] maturity is perseverance
[1:09:36] never stop despite the opposition that's
[1:09:39] against you
[1:09:43] maturity is humility
[1:10:14] maturity is dependability
[1:10:20] keeping your word
[1:10:23] for you're only as good as your word
[1:10:27] maturity is to live
[1:10:38] maturity is to stick with what you
[1:10:41] started
[1:11:24] let there be a
[1:11:38] knowledge
[1:11:52] just because we know what it takes to be
[1:11:53] a christian does not make us a christian
[1:11:57] christian
[1:11:59] we hear the message the tapes and so
[1:12:01] forth as a message of the hour
[1:12:04] does not make us the message
[1:12:16] and maybe gained a little understanding
[1:12:18] of maturity
[1:12:31] do i have your attention a little more
[1:12:32] now yeah
[1:12:34] all right let's see where
[1:12:37] and the lord said unto satan
[1:12:39] hast thou considered my servant job
[1:12:45] there is none like him
[1:12:55] i've told you this but i asked my father
[1:12:57] one day the question how could he be
[1:12:59] perfect
[1:13:01] when the perfect sacrifice hadn't come
[1:13:05] he was perfect to what was required of
[1:13:07] him at the time
[1:13:11] and god is telling saying he is perfect
[1:13:16] upright man
[1:13:44] to hold your integrity when all hell is
[1:13:47] coming against you
[1:13:50] integrity integrity listen closely
[1:13:53] escuche is the state of being whole or
[1:13:56] undivided in integro
[1:14:26] and mature man job was
[1:14:31] an immature person
[1:14:34] they question their beliefs
[1:14:38] every time a tough situation comes
[1:14:45] oh come on now
[1:14:47] i'm going to say it again
[1:14:49] an immature person the person
[1:14:51] questions their belief
[1:14:54] any time a tough situation comes
[1:14:57] in a situation
[1:14:58] any time someone comes and gives them a
[1:15:01] better idea they think
[1:15:04] they just question their belief every
[1:15:06] time hey yo students
[1:15:35] here it
[1:15:36] is today that's not integrity
[1:15:42] have you considered my servant that's
[1:15:44] considered
[1:15:45] there's none like him
[1:15:47] come
[1:15:51] imagine the on speaking that about you
[1:15:53] and i imagine
[1:15:56] i'm i'm starting to feel pretty good
[1:15:58] right now
[1:16:00] it's the state once again of being
[1:16:02] undivided
[1:16:04] and therefore to find your purpose in
[1:16:07] life foreign
[1:16:18] other than that you're trying to be
[1:16:19] mature in something you're not called to
[1:16:21] do puerto rico
[1:16:25] come to a conclusion
[1:16:27] a conclusion why so many people don't
[1:16:29] like to empty out
[1:16:41] when we talk about about the holy spirit
[1:16:44] and and the new birth and and getting
[1:16:46] filled with the holy ghost
[1:16:52] we don't realize that first of all we
[1:16:53] got to empty ourselves out no no
[1:16:59] you gotta empty yourself out first you
[1:17:02] know and even though you empty out
[1:17:05] and you feel clean
[1:17:07] but a lot of times white people don't
[1:17:10] like to empty out
[1:17:14] because there's a certain feeling of
[1:17:16] loneliness that comes with it
[1:17:21] did you get that i'm going to say it
[1:17:22] again there's a certain feeling of
[1:17:24] loneliness
[1:17:27] when you're emptying it out
[1:17:30] you see the feeling of loneliness though
[1:17:34] now listen
[1:17:36] young people get this
[1:17:39] many times with loneliness
[1:17:42] comes
[1:18:03] loneliness is not necessarily a bad
[1:18:05] thing
[1:18:08] it is if you
[1:18:09] dwell there too long
[1:18:13] but loneliness is actually could
[1:18:15] actually be a good thing brother brother
[1:18:17] coyote
[1:18:20] because it was in elohim's loneliness
[1:18:24] when
[1:18:26] that prompted him to think about you and
[1:18:29] i yellow
[1:18:31] than me i'm going to say it again
[1:18:33] it was in elohim's loneliness
[1:18:36] that got him to begin to think
[1:18:52] no i
[1:19:04] but you got to make sure that when
[1:19:06] loneliness
[1:19:19] that's why it's so important that when
[1:19:21] loneliness hits it's important
[1:19:24] to do something about it
[1:19:27] don't just sit there
[1:19:31] i don't know
[1:19:33] life is just not you're already in in no
[1:19:36] man's land
[1:19:39] it's then that we must fill ourselves up
[1:19:44] but the loneliness
[1:19:46] is actually the deep calling
[1:20:01] i can't talk to you when there's a lot
[1:20:02] of noise
[1:20:17] [Music]
[1:20:44] that's what we're aiming for
[1:20:48] to grow to come to a spiritual maturity
[1:20:53] problem is is that we don't like the
[1:20:55] process
[1:21:13] let's see
[1:21:14] what luke 180 says
[1:21:17] lucas
[1:21:18] this is talking about john there's
[1:21:19] something real simple but
[1:21:21] you're talking about maturity
[1:21:24] watch
[1:21:25] and the child
[1:21:40] not only did he grow but he whacked
[1:21:42] strong
[1:21:43] in spirit
[1:21:47] how many of us here don't don't just
[1:21:49] look this as babies like the little
[1:21:50] unborn natural baby
[1:21:55] look at yourself maybe sometimes we're
[1:21:57] babies in church for years
[1:22:01] but then
[1:22:05] amen hire your neighbor then he grew up
[1:22:10] the child grew and waxed strong in
[1:22:12] spirits
[1:22:14] and was in the deserts yes
[1:22:17] you know what the word desert there
[1:22:19] means
[1:22:21] it's a solitary place
[1:22:27] solo
[1:22:28] no one likes the desert very much do
[1:22:30] they
[1:22:32] know they like in the mountains and
[1:22:36] in the ocean
[1:23:04] over here
[1:23:07] [Music]
[1:24:35] through the sexual relation between a
[1:24:36] man and a woman
[1:24:38] sexuality
[1:24:40] in all manner just like you and i
[1:24:42] watch
[1:25:08] and in favor with god and man
[1:26:17] must go through that process
[1:26:22] brother jimmy the other day i had him
[1:26:24] make a teaching for brother or brother
[1:26:26] morton
[1:26:30] taking on
[1:26:32] the apostles generation
[1:27:13] the apostles generation would be till
[1:27:16] the end of the
[1:27:32] when you study a generation it can be 40
[1:27:33] years it can be 70 years it can be i
[1:27:35] mean
[1:27:39] write this down
[1:27:42] the holy spirit through him made this
[1:27:44] statement that just wowed me
[1:27:50] how long is a generation
[1:27:54] is it a certain amount of time
[1:27:57] he said no
[1:27:59] no for the gentile
[1:28:01] gentiles it's not based on time
[1:28:05] it's based on maturity espacado in la
[1:28:07] madres
[1:28:10] my that's a mouthful
[1:28:12] yes israel was given a specific amount
[1:28:14] of time
[1:28:18] are appointed to you and your people
[1:28:19] daniel
[1:28:21] but to the gentiles there's no time but
[1:28:25] he's waiting for maturities
[1:28:28] he wants to see that much that fruit
[1:28:30] matures
[1:28:33] he wants to see the pride tree come to a
[1:28:35] complete maturity
[1:28:38] wait brother says yes
[1:28:54] it's based on maturity for us
[1:28:57] established
[1:28:58] how many mature people do we have here
[1:29:05] we're in trouble
[1:29:07] brother alan we're in trouble
[1:29:09] how many mature people do we have here
[1:29:14] you
[1:29:17] i know some of you are like algonos
[1:29:22] i'm gonna raise it by faith
[1:29:26] raise your hand by faith
[1:29:29] i see the end product
[1:29:32] he sees the end product
[1:29:35] the maturing process el proceso de
[1:29:38] madures is the process that the
[1:29:40] revelation goes through
[1:29:43] in order to take us back to where we
[1:29:46] came from
[1:29:48] it's been the maturing of the harvest
[1:30:02] that's why he says should we go and take
[1:30:04] the tears out
[1:30:07] no
[1:30:08] because when when it's still immature or
[1:30:10] it's still young
[1:30:13] the wheat and the tears look exactly the
[1:30:15] same
[1:30:17] let them grow together
[1:30:34] and these 6 000 years has been the
[1:30:36] maturing of the harvest
[1:30:40] now the seed has become a seed itself
[1:30:46] it went back to the blossom from blossom
[1:30:48] to the fruit where they they said
[1:30:50] florida flores
[1:30:52] and it's the gathering time now the
[1:30:54] harvest time
[1:30:58] all the great things that started las
[1:31:00] grandes cosas
[1:31:11] and the antichrist that started in
[1:31:13] genesis el antichristo campus
[1:31:27] i'm going to believe that that's
[1:31:29] speaking of us
[1:31:31] it's right on the top esther and sima
[1:31:34] but there's a danger of being
[1:31:36] but
[1:31:38] i'm going to say it again there's a
[1:31:40] danger of that of that fruit that's on
[1:31:42] top i'm
[1:31:45] the danger is that those birds love to
[1:31:48] go pick the fruit that's on the top
[1:31:54] brother be careful there's some maybe
[1:31:55] some birds poking at your head
[1:32:10] the last church age is here he says
[1:32:14] he is coming to full mature allegations
[1:32:18] paradox
[1:32:21] it's a bright tree it's
[1:32:23] jesus was the tree of life from the
[1:32:25] garden of eden
[1:32:28] how else could we reach maturity
[1:32:37] jesus christ would come to dwell in us
[1:32:40] jesus christ
[1:32:43] it is the rising of the sun
[1:32:47] the waving of the shift
[1:32:50] what was the sheath
[1:32:52] the one that come to maturity first la
[1:32:55] que vino madures primero
[1:32:59] come on church who's being waived here
[1:33:02] i'm not going to guess too much of that
[1:33:03] because that's one of our panels we have
[1:33:05] coming out panels
[1:33:20] we could maybe prove
[1:33:34] began
[1:34:00] foreign
[1:34:09] it was the first one to come to maturity
[1:34:13] and it was waved as a memorial
[1:34:30] i'm going to say it again believing that
[1:34:31] the rest of griendo
[1:34:35] the rest
[1:34:40] problem then many times we try to
[1:34:41] understand god with her
[1:34:43] now i'm going to speak for myself
[1:35:26] corinthians 13 11 tells us
[1:35:32] when i was a child
[1:35:35] when i was immature
[1:35:36] maduro
[1:35:39] how many of you were born mature
[1:35:55] and maduros
[1:35:56] same way in the spiritual right
[1:35:58] [Music]
[1:36:00] when i was a child you had a nino
[1:36:03] i did things backwards you always say
[1:36:05] las cosas
[1:36:06] paul's telling the corinthians
[1:36:09] i spake as a child first
[1:36:13] i understood as a child
[1:36:16] and i thought as a child
[1:36:19] i did things backwards
[1:36:49] oh yeah yeah sometimes you get thoughts
[1:36:51] and like i better not say that
[1:36:56] so when i was a child i spake first as a
[1:36:58] child
[1:37:02] man i shouldn't have said that
[1:37:18] but when i became a
[1:37:33] maduro i became perfect perfecto
[1:37:37] the process of it
[1:37:40] i fought first spencer follow him
[1:37:42] thought for hello
[1:37:44] then he understood the very plan that he
[1:38:27] we should have kept our mouth shut
[1:38:45] and i began to see things in the word
[1:38:47] ephesians 4 11 through 14.
[1:38:53] and he gave some apostles
[1:38:56] when did he take that out of the church
[1:38:59] see where he gave some but i don't see
[1:39:01] where he took them
[1:39:04] some prophets oh i know more prophets
[1:39:08] not major prophets
[1:39:24] without this
[1:39:28] for the perfecting or maturing of the
[1:39:30] saints
[1:39:33] i i i mean i'm not making this stuff up
[1:39:36] no
[1:39:37] invention
[1:39:38] the maturing of the saints
[1:39:42] for the work of the ministry
[1:39:44] for the edifying of the body of christ
[1:39:47] but now we should be teachers
[1:39:50] we're still having to be taught
[1:40:20] how else do you want to get there
[1:40:23] unto a mature man
[1:40:27] measure of the stature
[1:40:29] of
[1:40:30] that word stature means maturity
[1:40:34] of the maturity of the fullness of
[1:40:36] christ
[1:40:39] that we henceforth be no more children
[1:40:42] or immature but
[1:40:48] carried
[1:41:03] 3 15 says philippe says
[1:41:05] you want me to go to the next one i'm
[1:41:07] like oh oh that's for you guys
[1:41:10] philip 3 15. let us therefore as many as
[1:41:14] be perfect or mature
[1:41:24] and if anything ye be otherwise minded
[1:41:27] god shall reveal even this unto you is
[1:41:41] that you all had a good time the other
[1:41:43] day and
[1:41:59] fishbowl those who don't know is this
[1:42:01] bowl and they have a bunch of questions
[1:42:05] and they pull them out
[1:42:08] and then they discuss it
[1:42:12] and like anything else
[1:42:15] you guys
[1:42:17] tell me if i'm wrong yes like anything
[1:42:19] else
[1:42:20] you always seem to get two sides
[1:42:38] and the first thing you do is
[1:42:54] first thing you do is that let's see
[1:42:56] where she stands
[1:43:01] so they got into some good subjects
[1:43:06] good stuff
[1:43:08] anything from
[1:43:09] you know
[1:43:11] how much makeup should i put on or can i
[1:43:12] put on or not
[1:43:17] and you hear these questions
[1:43:20] first thing everybody does
[1:43:46] what should we do or not do
[1:43:49] is it wrong or not it is
[1:44:04] immaturity imadures
[1:44:10] it doesn't matter what the subject is
[1:44:16] someone told brother tommy one time
[1:44:18] again
[1:44:31] foreign
[1:44:35] i ain't going to get into those those
[1:44:37] things anyway
[1:44:39] but after a while
[1:44:42] it's like you can pick and choose
[1:44:44] whatever you want to do or don't do well
[1:44:46] because
[1:45:27] look for loopholes
[1:45:43] but don't try to get everyone else to
[1:45:45] live to your standards
[1:45:49] your revelation you hold on to that yes
[1:45:53] that's pretty clear young people this is
[1:45:55] cloud
[1:45:56] well well look what it says here bueno
[1:46:02] what are you looking for
[1:46:06] and the worst thing about it
[1:46:08] is that when you see who's on the other
[1:46:10] side of the aisle
[1:46:13] now you don't want to talk to them
[1:46:19] immature
[1:46:21] immaturity
[1:46:22] let's grow up a little bit
[1:46:24] poco
[1:46:38] but i
[1:47:02] let's go on because then we get into
[1:47:04] little side things and then
[1:47:06] what's your take
[1:47:36] he's going to turn his church into
[1:47:38] manhood now
[1:47:40] we have played and frolicked like
[1:47:42] children
[1:47:44] but now we're coming in childish things
[1:47:48] who wants to go with
[1:47:59] let's go to maturity perfection now
[1:48:02] vamos al maduro
[1:48:31] can bitterly disagree with anyone
[1:48:36] against them
[1:48:39] god's honest truth
[1:48:42] in me that would hold it against them
[1:48:43] because they see it or don't see it like
[1:48:45] me
[1:48:49] but sure i'm going to talk to them
[1:48:55] and you think you're all grown up yeah
[1:49:11] revelations 1 14 his head and his hairs
[1:49:13] were
[1:49:14] white
[1:49:20] and you read that with me
[1:49:23] in english his head
[1:49:25] and his hairs were white like wool
[1:49:29] as white as snow
[1:49:32] in the exposition of the seven church
[1:49:34] ages exposition
[1:49:36] brother brown says john first notices
[1:49:40] juan primero and mentions the whiteness
[1:49:42] of his hair
[1:49:46] it was white
[1:49:48] blanco and his brightest snow
[1:49:51] this was not because of his age
[1:49:56] oh no no the brilliantly white hair does
[1:49:59] not signify age
[1:50:02] no significa like that but experience
[1:50:07] maturity madurese and
[1:50:21] wisdom means so
[1:50:33] when he says nothing short of perfect
[1:50:36] love will be there but
[1:51:02] without perfect faith you ain't going to
[1:51:04] be there either
[1:51:06] what is perfect faith mature faith
