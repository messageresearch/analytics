[23:55] stress on this if you have a desk job
[23:56] which it in neutral hood escritorio
[23:58] this is almost as bad as smoking the
[24:00] sacristan mallow como fumar because you

[25:05] constant living even in the future II
[25:07] see a brick was that they meant avian

[26:28] have felt the way and some of these was
[26:31] some of these things amazing to us econ
[26:32] algunas de estas cosas and and as humans
[26:34] were never satisfied with Cindy combo
[26:36] models per se que nunca estamos at his

[31:52] explosion in social media in general
[31:54] paralyze policy on a los medios sociales
[31:56] in general they say is a direct
[31:58] correlation you think is directamente
[32:00] una una una correlation with depression
[32:02] con la depression you say because you
[32:05] have less face-to-face interaction be a
[32:07] name menos interact young Caracara you
[32:10] isolate yourself they say in a solace
[32:13] and and I'm not throwing at her you know
[32:15] stricted and earlier I deal with a lot
[32:17] of work is what I do is okay I go your
[32:19] way and I'll give you an example we have
[32:23] a young man that works with us it is
[32:24] doing so true and he's a he's a sharp
[32:28] he's a sharp young gentleman it's all
[32:30] open muy inteligente he's a go-getter
[32:32] it is alguien que que que isn't
[32:34] enthroned but he's a millennial better
[32:36] soon millennial and he's very sharp okay
[32:39] yes muy inteligente e but he did not
[32:41] know how to deal with failure pero no
[32:43] sorry commonly they are con con fight
[32:44] even though he's a least experienced
[32:46] technician that we have okay LLL
[32:48] technical Menace experimental he's the
[32:50] most verbal and most opinionated I still
[32:51] came a subpoena
[32:52] Elmas verbal but he's the one who knows
[32:54] less the raziel case now a menos so
[32:56] anytime I have to go and correct him
[32:57] novice ki KI recorder here Lou I have to
[32:59] come at a certain angle they work
[33:00] earlier this year terminator I have an
[33:02] older gentleman that works with me tango
[33:03] I come here oh my Orkut raha conmigo
[33:05] have a baby boomer that works with me
[33:08] you know kk opinion seok-ki any pillows
[33:16] the loss in Quintus I have a couple of
[33:20] Generation Xers they go oh no that I
[33:21] handed a C on it and I have one
[33:23] millennium you millennial and so the
[33:25] reason I started studying this lettuce
[33:26] okay is to us because working in and
[33:29] where I work for kid on the trabajo you
[33:31] so the company got bought out by a
[33:33] bigger corporation a control company ala
[33:35] computer corporation masculine and in
[33:36] this corporation they're a little more
[33:37] strict he saw mass is strict so we have
[33:40] to be careful
[33:41] tenemos que tener mucho cuidado we have
[33:42] to be politically correct and everything
[33:43] that we do we political mental correct
[33:46] dose and okay same so we can't sing a
[33:47] lot just anybody
[33:48] nope I'm also know this is you know mas
[33:50] because now we're liable for lawsuits
[33:51] for controls estamos pendiente cycle
[33:54] golly so we had to find a harder reach
[33:56] these different groups a most k-code
[33:59] como el cáncer estos group and it's
[34:00] tricky because one I can correct one way
[34:02] es algo complicado kakora he denominator
[34:05] but the millennia he's special
[34:07] pero los millennial is on a specialist
[34:09] and and and there's an all reality I
[34:11] don't know what he's thinking half the
[34:13] time yeah really dad maybe attempt was a
[34:15] que piensa he's very passionate what he
[34:17] does who said we Appassionata low-caste
[34:19] he means well it k de ser el bien he
[34:22] wants to excel today el caso de salir
[34:25] there's no one more motivated in in that
[34:27] office that him knowing that he must
[34:29] motivate onl oficina kill but just he's
[34:31] different
[34:32] pero es diferente so what so what is
[34:37] yeah so I started studying these
[34:41] generations and just to give you a
[34:42] little just just to set a little
[34:43] foundation get this para para
[34:45] fundamentalist we understand here a

[1:08:10] have created the world's first
[1:08:12] genetically edited baby this is a que
[1:08:15] aquí el el primero a way I ended up
[1:08:18] kinetic Amenti creado in a potential
[1:08:21] groundbreaking controversial medical
[1:08:23] first in a noon noon territorial put the
[1:08:27] sale meant a controversial America meant
[1:08:32] the controversial I don't know if you
[1:08:35] guys how many I've ever heard on the
[1:08:36] gene-editing you've heard on other
[1:08:38] editing jeans supporters which are the
[1:08:41] converse K edit antennas so they've been
[1:08:43] able to add a genes like in mice it was
[1:08:45] this edit and heinous component only
[1:08:47] certain mushrooms in in cierto Tsongas
[1:08:49] and apparently now they have human
[1:08:50] studies are para tomato retinas to you
[1:08:52] tomorrow so they don't know how true it
[1:08:54] is yet no sorry kitten better than a
[1:08:56] racist uh but so what they do the
[1:08:58] purpose of this tape repositories to is
[1:09:00] and it says all realities to see you so
[1:09:02] you can you know lay up our studies but
[1:09:04] ok ok so so this kind of gene editing is
[1:09:07] banned in most countries as they people
[1:09:09] edition the henna says esta stop it
[1:09:12] in module realises many mainstream
[1:09:15] scientists think that is too unsafe to
[1:09:16] try muchos científicos principalis
[1:09:19] piensan que no es muy seguro para
[1:09:21] intentar lo
[1:09:22] and this researcher janicoo yes they
[1:09:25] investigador janicoo of Southern
[1:09:28] University of Science and Technology
