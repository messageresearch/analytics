[38:44] amen you may be seated
[38:49] tonight we're gonna we're gonna Broach
[38:51] uh about three subjects
[38:56] and I don't know if uh if you have uh if
[39:00] you uh know about them
[39:07] but it's it's things that are that are
[39:10] interwoven in our society so much that
[39:13] maybe maybe people don't know about them
[39:20] but the three subjects that we're going
[39:22] to deal with
[39:25] is uh
[39:34] and CRT which is critical race theory he
[39:38] said I think is
[39:42] so how many have ever heard of of Woe
[39:52] some some people have it
[39:55] okay well maybe we'll we we will let you
[40:00] know a little bit how many have heard of
[40:01] cancer culture
[40:04] and and how many have have heard of
[40:07] critical race Theory
[40:13] it's very it's those those three uh uh
[40:17] subjects are are are very very prominent
[40:19] in our in our uh in in everyday life
[40:26] without people understanding but we're
[40:29] we're the they're so vast
[40:34] that it would take us time but but we're
[40:37] going to do the best that we can tonight
[40:38] in the time of pro appropriate to it
[40:44] and so in it to start before I I hand it
[40:48] off to brother William
[40:51] I I do want to read uh Genesis the third
[40:55] chapter
[40:58] and and this is the beginning
[41:02] or on on the earth because you all you
[41:05] we we know that that Satan is the the
[41:08] author of perversion yes this is
[41:13] and so so so but but this is on the
[41:18] earth is where it began the woke
[41:24] and it says this in Genesis chapter 3
[41:28] and verse 5.
[41:53] this is where we're going to to launch
[41:56] off
[41:57] at this moment
[42:00] amen God bless you this evening
[42:04] um this is uh like brother Tommy said
[42:06] this is a vast vast subject
[42:12] you know we we see um
[42:16] uh different things
[42:18] um concerning woke
[42:24] it's it's not only uh it's it's a daily
[42:29] bait on a daily basis we we are
[42:32] bombarded by this
[42:37] and I wanna I wanna uh
[42:41] there there's a there's a there's a
[42:44] pride flag that is that is out there
[42:49] and and we see it we see it everywhere
[42:53] not only do we see it on private uh uh
[42:57] private structures
[43:01] but we also see it on government public
[43:04] structures as well
[43:09] as uh as we were uh discussing this is
[43:16] brought to my attention I I actually
[43:18] spoke a little bit about this in uh in
[43:21] Uganda
[43:24] now in Uganda in Uganda when I mentioned
[43:28] the pride flag is
[43:30] they had zero idea what that meant
[43:35] so that that tells me is of the
[43:40] condition that we are in
[43:43] so if they can uh put up that uh that
[43:47] slide here so
[43:50] on the on the left here the is the is
[43:53] the pride flag Alice
[43:56] now we understand that that the that the
[44:01] rainbow
[44:03] that that we know of
[44:05] it consists of seven colors okay
[44:12] um the pride flag consists of six colors
[44:16] and it was very interesting to see which
[44:21] color has been omitted
[44:25] going back to Let's if we can turn into
[44:28] Matthew 5 48.
[44:38] and it reads like this
[44:40] be ye therefore perfect
[44:43] even as your father which is in heaven
[44:46] is perfect
[44:51] so we have Perfection
[44:54] okay so we go up and we see
[44:58] um on the stature of a perfect man
[45:03] we do see the seven colors
[45:07] now what's interesting is there was uh
[45:13] there was a um there was an author
[45:18] many years ago
[45:20] who saw this who saw this flag Miro esta
[45:25] Bandera or he saw these colors
[45:28] and he says
[45:30] it is customary
[45:33] by the way his name is Isaac Asimov Su
[45:36] number is Isaac Asimov it says it is
[45:39] customary to list Indigo
[45:43] and at least Indigo as a color lying
[45:47] between blue and violet
[45:52] but it has never seemed to me
[45:57] that Indigo que indigo is worth the
[46:01] Dignity
[46:02] of being considered a separate color the
[46:06] sequence
[46:08] and by the way indigo is the color
[46:20] what is the step
[46:22] of indigo okay
[46:25] Indigo exactly right
[46:35] you got patience please Virginia
[46:37] knowledge and for patience godliness
[46:38] brotherly kindness so godliness was the
[46:43] color indigo
[46:45] it has been omitted
[46:48] now here's here's the here's the
[46:51] definition of indigo
[46:53] definition and this will kind of create
[46:56] a basis of what we're of what we're uh
[46:59] of what we're going to be talking about
[47:01] here is hablendo
[47:05] Indigo conveys integrity and deep
[47:08] sincerity
[47:13] it is powerful and dignified
[47:18] the color the color of indigo El color
[47:22] indigo reflects great devotion
[47:25] represents
[47:28] wisdom
[47:30] and justice
[47:33] all right
[47:34] well according to what we know as woke
[47:40] the I guess the Battle Cry you can say
[47:43] is
[47:46] Justice
[47:48] or a lot of times Injustice
[47:53] now when we look at godliness
[47:57] why has godliness been omitted
[48:02] why has this been taken away
[48:05] well we understand with Matthew 5 48.
[48:13] ye therefore
[48:15] Perfecto even as your father which is in
[48:18] heaven is perfect
[48:21] and we get that so many times of
[48:24] perfection
[48:28] we hear that many times well there's no
[48:31] way we can be perfect
[48:35] and I say of course
[48:37] if you take something away
[48:40] that is supposed to be there
[48:43] you cannot be perfect
[48:45] but with it there
[48:48] we can be perfect
[48:51] brother Brandon would say
[48:54] he said he tried to find the meaning of
[48:57] godliness in in four or five
[49:00] dictionaries he says
[49:04] and he says that he went over with
[49:07] brother Jeffries there is and he says
[49:10] that they found it together
[49:12] and he puts it simply as this
[49:16] godliness
[49:18] means significa to be like God
[49:22] what a contrast
[49:25] the scripture that brother Tommy just
[49:27] heard
[49:29] when the serpent would say they shall be
[49:33] as God
[49:37] to be like God
[49:42] were they
[49:44] already like God see
[49:49] they were they they were perfect and
[49:51] when and what they were in their
[49:53] condition they were perfect
[49:59] foreign to be like God
[50:03] he says
[50:06] he says
[50:07] oh you say that you can't do that
[50:11] he says oh yes you can oh see us
[50:16] now
[50:17] what
[50:19] what we see nowadays
[50:23] and what
[50:25] you know I I wanted to ask brother Jim a
[50:28] question
[50:31] concerning about what
[50:34] uh the way that he grew up
[50:38] we understand our condition now
[50:43] since since brother Jim is our senior
[50:46] here
[50:49] how was it like when you were growing up
[50:54] well and the uh
[50:56] 70s and 80s
[51:00] the trendy term was
[51:03] that the term that was popular
[51:07] called Trend in English how would you
[51:10] say it in Spanish
[51:14] you were either you just said the same
[51:17] in Spanish because I don't even know if
[51:19] there's a word in Spanish word you were
[51:21] either hip or you weren't hip wait uh
[51:27] later on
[51:28] when when the spirit of
[51:31] homosexuality started to attack the
[51:33] young people more they started using the
[51:36] term guruvi
[51:38] um
[51:42] very innocent things
[51:45] in a sentence but the only thing was if
[51:48] you weren't hip uh
[51:51] you could never be groovy
[51:55] and you were out you weren't accepted
[51:58] the people at school and stuff
[52:03] and and this thing on bookism their
[52:06] approach is the same thing
[52:11] are you woke is
[52:24] and how it's tied together do you do you
[52:27] now understand that words have meanings
[52:34] that's why when brother Branham says the
[52:36] greatest thing you can tell your brother
[52:38] is God bless you
[52:39] guys
[52:42] but what they use what what Society uses
[52:46] words is they use them not for benefit
[52:49] they use them as weapons
[52:55] and when a person or a country or a
[52:59] society will take a word to use it as a
[53:02] weapon
[53:05] for Destruction
[53:10] think about think about the words that
[53:12] are used
[53:17] so as as as brother Jim was saying
[53:21] in his generation
[53:24] I like what John Wesley said
[53:27] he says what one generation tolerates
[53:34] the next generation will Embrace
[53:41] this was there a couple hundred years
[53:44] ago
[53:47] but my how it does come exactly into our
[53:51] time
[53:54] what the previous generation thought of
[53:57] as okay as as as something innocent
[54:03] it was tolerated
[54:07] in our generation
[54:10] in my children's generation
[54:13] oh my goodness how
[54:16] it has infiltrated into our into our
[54:19] children's Generations
[54:22] big time is that right brother Jerry yes
[54:27] if I can relate it
[54:31] that happened
[54:34] just a few years ago
[54:36] and it involved Timothy when he was
[54:39] playing football
[54:40] [Music]
[54:43] Americano and he had to go get a
[54:45] physical he took okay
[54:50] well organ mountain now I guess
[54:56] watch what you say you know you don't
[54:59] know who's watching
[55:02] but he went for a physical and and I
[55:05] went in there and and I told the lady I
[55:07] said he's here for a physical
[55:11] so they gave us an iPad
[55:14] so I told Timmy just fill out your
[55:16] information you know um
[55:18] old you are your name your address
[55:21] things like that yeah
[55:26] so then he brings me an iPad the iPad
[55:29] with a he had like a concerned look on
[55:31] his face
[55:36] this was probably about two thousand
[55:39] fifteen I would say
[55:42] right around there anyways he has a
[55:46] concerned look on his face and I'm like
[55:47] you know
[55:49] so I I get he goes dad what are they
[55:52] asking me here
[55:54] so I look at the iPad and it has you
[55:58] know you know you know normal
[55:59] applications you have the top male or
[56:01] female you know sex male or female
[56:02] applications
[56:07] so he you know of course he puts mail
[56:11] but then right below that it says
[56:19] [Music]
[56:23] and then it starts getting well what do
[56:25] you identify as
[56:28] and and I'm like
[56:30] and then it starts getting into do you
[56:33] have have you had homophobic thoughts
[56:39] do you think you're gay bienza is
[56:42] homosexual and and and I and I and right
[56:45] there I stopped I said you're not
[56:46] answering these questions no more yeah
[56:50] because we all we all know that they
[56:53] they have taken prayer out of the
[56:54] schools right
[56:57] you know they they they they fired a
[56:59] coach I believe was in Washington that
[57:01] he was praying that despite
[57:06] not necessarily with the team but off to
[57:08] to the side
[57:12] and they fired him you know because they
[57:15] don't want prayer in school they don't
[57:17] want God in school
[57:20] so so I I take this iPad back and I said
[57:24] we're not answering these questions
[57:26] we're here for a physical right
[57:32] so then right there I see they're
[57:34] starting to plant a seed in the young
[57:36] people
[57:39] they're trying to get them to question
[57:41] what they are questions
[57:44] you know us I I identify as a male right
[57:54] but then the question is well what do
[57:56] you identify as well how could they do
[58:00] that
[58:01] because
[58:04] but the way the way the people look at
[58:07] it or or look at it is if I had they
[58:10] don't know
[58:12] I can I I was born a male yeah
[58:15] we're born males we're born females
[58:18] but we can identify now
[58:23] as a female
[58:26] you know that this this is where they
[58:28] they this is where where the for society
[58:31] and and people that that that pushed the
[58:35] lbgqt P plus and whatever
[58:40] there are about a hundred gender
[58:43] identifications
[58:47] this is not this is not what I believe
[58:49] it's going to look at you but this is
[58:51] this is where they get this is where
[58:54] they get their entrance
[58:56] your sex is what you were born with
[59:01] your gender is what you identify as is
[59:06] so a person that was born a man
[59:11] can identify himself as a woman
[59:16] but let me tell you if you're born a man
[59:21] that's your sexual you are identified
[59:25] your gender is a man
[59:27] remember in the beginning
[59:30] God created man
[59:47] Amen to that oh my god brother tell me
[59:50] what would then constitute a woman
[59:54] it it
[59:56] all depends who if you're in office
[1:00:00] if you're a political official you
[1:00:04] cannot
[1:00:05] give that the definition of what a woman
[1:00:07] is
[1:00:13] one elected official that'll tell you
[1:00:16] what constitutes a woman
[1:00:22] now do you know why our children are so
[1:00:25] bombarded
[1:00:28] they go they go to public schools
[1:00:31] and they want to they want to make sure
[1:00:34] that from the eight from the age of two
[1:00:37] to seven
[1:00:41] that those seeds are planted inside of
[1:00:44] them
[1:00:47] asking kindergartens
[1:00:51] students
[1:00:54] comfortable in the gender you were born
[1:00:57] in is
[1:01:00] they can't even fight
[1:01:03] why do they know what a boy is what what
[1:01:06] a girl it is
[1:01:08] when the political system won't even
[1:01:11] tell you what a what a woman is when the
[1:01:13] system of politics we know what a woman
[1:01:15] is we know what a man is because of the
[1:01:19] message of the hours
[1:01:21] that identifies who we are in Christ
[1:01:24] but they don't know and they will not
[1:01:28] give you a straight answer
[1:01:32] why was she called a woman
[1:01:35] because she was taken out of man whoa
[1:01:38] man
[1:01:42] you aren't you do we really I mean
[1:01:45] Public
[1:01:47] Schools
[1:01:48] it's just I I mean we we brother brother
[1:01:51] will talked about the flag we we just
[1:01:54] came from Norway right yeah
[1:01:57] and people have gone out maybe
[1:02:00] vacationing during the month of June if
[1:02:02] you go out during the month of June you
[1:02:04] are going right into the
[1:02:24] brother Jimmy you said that brother
[1:02:27] Branham said when when he was here he
[1:02:28] said
[1:02:30] in 1962
[1:02:34] 40 of our government was already
[1:02:41] homosexuals
[1:02:45] this is 50 plus years later go ahead go
[1:02:48] ahead
[1:02:48] and just to finish that that thought
[1:02:52] though
[1:02:54] it's out everywhere but like like Bert
[1:02:56] Tommy said it's targeting the young
[1:02:58] children
[1:03:03] I mean perfect example is is is a movie
[1:03:07] that was released the last last weekend
[1:03:12] it's called light year
[1:03:25] but in that movie which is which young
[1:03:28] children would like to watch there is
[1:03:32] a scene
[1:03:34] where two young ladies
[1:03:38] call them ladies
[1:03:40] women female
[1:03:44] that they're kissing sister
[1:03:48] so so they're after the young people
[1:03:50] you know I I read something the other
[1:03:53] day that said that said the devil
[1:03:54] doesn't need to hide anymore
[1:03:59] because he's out in the open Pakistan
[1:04:02] and we still can't see him
[1:04:07] you know he's out everywhere say it
[1:04:09] again say it again it says the devil
[1:04:11] doesn't hide anymore
[1:04:14] because he's out in the open
[1:04:17] and we still cannot see him
[1:04:22] you know it it's everywhere
[1:04:24] you know and and I found this quote
[1:04:29] Oh Brother Branham
[1:04:32] and it says when they're the the
[1:04:34] messages when their eyes were opened
[1:04:38] they knew him of course we understand to
[1:04:42] be woke is to have your eyes open
[1:04:47] to be able to see
[1:04:49] what he says in the it says and I
[1:04:52] probably I won't read the whole thing
[1:04:53] because it's kind of lengthy
[1:04:56] but it says in the last days the setting
[1:04:59] of the world would be just like it was
[1:05:01] when the dent house was destroyed at
[1:05:04] Sodom and Gomorrah this is
[1:05:10] not not in Noah's time as the floor
[1:05:18] and if we re if you if you've all read
[1:05:20] about it you know what happened in Sodom
[1:05:22] and Gomorrah says
[1:05:27] brother Jerry
[1:05:29] basically what happened
[1:05:32] when those two angels
[1:05:35] went to lot's house
[1:05:38] I'll help you on that if you don't
[1:05:40] remember
[1:05:41] uh
[1:05:42] they come to this house
[1:05:45] and knock on the door and
[1:05:49] these men is
[1:05:54] they
[1:05:57] they didn't want women
[1:06:01] he offered his his daughters
[1:06:04] but they wanted the two angels
[1:06:07] Los Angeles
[1:06:09] we're in a physical form because
[1:06:13] that's incredible
[1:06:16] do you you do you do you realize how all
[1:06:20] these three things that we're we're
[1:06:21] speaking about are are so interconnected
[1:06:28] how they're interconnected
[1:06:30] they're interconnected because if
[1:06:33] somebody would be watching us right now
[1:06:38] they're going to put a label
[1:06:41] [Music]
[1:06:41] um
[1:06:42] and the label is going to be if you
[1:06:46] believe that God sent a prophet is
[1:06:52] right nobody's ever told you that all
[1:06:54] right you're a heretic
[1:06:59] right
[1:07:00] so right away with the label
[1:07:04] they cancel you
[1:07:07] you're irrelevant now is
[1:07:10] because you are not according to what
[1:07:14] our view system is anymore
[1:07:19] because let me tell you wokism foreign
[1:07:32] can I say it again it is a religion is
[1:07:36] and their writings are scripture is is
[1:07:42] and if you're against their church
[1:07:45] now you're labeled as against their
[1:07:49] church
[1:07:51] because they believe
[1:07:53] when they are woke
[1:07:56] they have been born again
[1:08:04] that is the culture whereby we live in
[1:08:08] is
[1:08:11] that's why there was a church age
[1:08:14] between Philadelphia and laurecia
[1:08:16] foreign
[1:08:42] but let me tell you we're Heretics to
[1:08:45] somebody
[1:08:48] there ain't gonna be everybody that that
[1:08:50] believes like you well Brothers
[1:08:53] didn't Paul say after the Wake called
[1:08:56] heresy worshiped by the god of my father
[1:08:58] that's right
[1:09:00] it's it's it's the scripture of of is
[1:09:03] and the day that we're living but I'm I
[1:09:06] am proud to be called the Malachi for
[1:09:08] five minutes
[1:09:13] [Applause]
[1:09:18] and uh from what uh from what brother
[1:09:22] was uh Tommy was saying
[1:09:25] there's a there's a little quote I found
[1:09:27] out uh today
[1:09:29] it says wokeness cancels anything or
[1:09:33] anyone that doesn't bow to his Ideology
[1:09:41] Now we we see woke not only in in what
[1:09:44] we call the world
[1:09:47] but it has become or it has come into
[1:09:52] our denominations our churches
[1:09:56] you see you see pastors
[1:09:59] ministers that are preaching on woke
[1:10:04] and my question how is that
[1:10:09] Christiano we preach a message of Grace
[1:10:11] and how is that Grace
[1:10:15] being woke Gracia
[1:10:24] canceled culture preaches this
[1:10:28] believe what we say to believe
[1:10:34] or else we will destroy your life
[1:10:39] Council culture plays God
[1:10:43] while Christianity
[1:10:47] or what we believe
[1:10:50] pursue Grace
[1:10:53] so I I think that is that is that is so
[1:10:56] relevant in our society right now is
[1:11:00] that this cancer culture is
[1:11:04] there's something about it
[1:11:07] that doesn't seek forgiveness
[1:11:11] forgiveness is not enough for them
[1:11:15] they have so much they have so much
[1:11:18] anger in this
[1:11:20] angry at what has happened
[1:11:24] even if it doesn't even if it even if it
[1:11:28] hasn't affected them directly
[1:11:33] you say are upset at what happened 100
[1:11:36] 200 years ago
[1:11:40] come up with a victim's mentality
[1:11:45] and if you don't agree with their
[1:11:47] mentality
[1:11:50] they will do everything they can to
[1:11:52] destroy your
[1:11:57] I think you said something about a a
[1:11:59] movie that says
[1:12:02] there's a movie which again is called
[1:12:04] light year
[1:12:06] light year and that's why I made the
[1:12:08] statement we we the devil doesn't need
[1:12:10] to hide
[1:12:13] because he's just out there plain and
[1:12:16] simple where we can see him
[1:12:19] but us as parents
[1:12:22] we have young children
[1:12:25] that I'm sure they've seen the the the
[1:12:27] the trailer to the movie
[1:12:31] oh yeah let's go see that movie Mom and
[1:12:34] Dad
[1:12:35] um
[1:12:36] where us as parents we should be
[1:12:39] protecting our children
[1:12:44] but yeah we'll go and take them to see
[1:12:46] this movie
[1:12:48] that's why the devil's out there but but
[1:12:51] he said ah you can't see me
[1:12:54] come on bring your children bring your
[1:12:57] children
[1:12:58] no as Christians we we got to take a
[1:13:01] stand for something
[1:13:04] parents we gotta protect our children
[1:13:08] and make the stand for them also
[1:13:11] because let them know that that that
[1:13:13] they are God's Property
[1:13:17] we are God's properties
[1:13:20] protect our children
[1:13:22] they might not know what's going on
[1:13:26] but we gotta stand as parents
[1:13:29] even as Grandparents because the
[1:13:33] children come up to the grandparents and
[1:13:34] say hey Papa can you take me to the
[1:13:36] movies
[1:13:39] but I for one will not will not do that
[1:13:44] because they're targeting the young
[1:13:47] children
[1:13:50] that's why it says
[1:13:53] in this in this quote it says
[1:13:55] as the days in Sodom and Gomorrah
[1:13:58] he promised there would be a great
[1:14:01] perversion in the land
[1:14:04] is that not going on right now
[1:14:09] is that not going on right now
[1:14:11] it's perversion version of the Mind the
[1:14:15] version of the heart
[1:14:17] but that's why your eye of the heart
[1:14:19] needs to be open
[1:14:23] to God's word and I want to say it again
[1:14:27] by our pastor and the parents that
[1:14:31] should be protecting the children
[1:14:35] are taking the children to watch it
[1:14:39] standing for the truth in their homes
[1:14:44] stay at the Lord
[1:14:47] and the thing about it that is one thing
[1:14:50] that God never forgave Israel for yes
[1:14:55] when they pass their children through
[1:14:58] the fires
[1:15:01] and that is very dangerous
[1:15:05] is there passing people through the fire
[1:15:08] if you believe that it's wrong to see
[1:15:11] this this movie it might not just be
[1:15:13] Disney but other movies
[1:15:15] don't take your children to watch it
[1:15:18] let's not saith the Lord
[1:15:21] Brother Tommy that takes me to that to
[1:15:23] that scripture
[1:15:26] when it says train your child in the
[1:15:29] ways of the Lord and when he is old he
[1:15:32] will not depart from it
[1:15:34] but Satan takes that as well
[1:15:37] so we see that training the children
[1:15:41] [Music]
[1:15:42] in the ways well when they are old
[1:15:47] they can't look back
[1:15:49] and they can't say well remember that
[1:15:52] time when when when my mom and dad they
[1:15:55] stood for what was right
[1:15:59] no they'll save remember the time
[1:16:03] when my mom and dad just let me do
[1:16:06] anything I wanted to do
[1:16:09] that's how Satan is so Sly yes
[1:16:13] not only does does God want to teach our
[1:16:16] children
[1:16:18] so that when these these things do come
[1:16:22] up
[1:16:24] it's their lives
[1:16:26] they are prepared
[1:16:29] they're they're
[1:16:31] prepared for this is
[1:16:34] they're prepared for this fight they
[1:16:37] know exactly what to do
[1:16:40] but instead
[1:16:42] no it was it was uh it was uh a few
[1:16:46] weeks ago ASE una semanas I was talking
[1:16:49] with my neighbor
[1:16:50] and she was telling me well I I changed
[1:16:54] jobs in school
[1:16:58] she had been a teacher for over 20 years
[1:17:02] she says I was a teacher in an
[1:17:05] elementary school
[1:17:08] elementary and they were were coming out
[1:17:12] with curriculum
[1:17:13] coneste Corso
[1:17:16] about critical race Theory
[1:17:19] critical about being transgendered and
[1:17:22] all that this is
[1:17:27] I can't teach that
[1:17:30] now this is someone that does that that
[1:17:34] she might believe in God she might not I
[1:17:37] don't know
[1:17:40] but she says I can't teach that
[1:17:43] so why stop being a teacher yeah
[1:17:48] I'm being forced
[1:17:51] teach this to seven and eight year olds
[1:17:56] is
[1:17:58] that I can't do that
[1:18:01] uh brother will explain to people a bit
[1:18:04] more what is critical race Theory well
[1:18:11] we find out
[1:18:13] that wokeness
[1:18:17] critical race Theory
[1:18:21] Isa it's based on the belief is that
[1:18:28] if if you're white
[1:18:31] is Blanco
[1:18:34] you have privilege
[1:18:36] you have what's called White Privilege
[1:18:41] so that means
[1:18:44] that whatever is available locate a job
[1:18:48] whatever it is
[1:18:50] you have all the rights to that
[1:18:54] because of your skin color
[1:18:58] it doesn't involve any other race
[1:19:03] but but the white race
[1:19:06] it says according to to woke thought
[1:19:09] leaders
[1:19:14] racism is the foundational basis racismo
[1:19:19] is
[1:19:19] for American Structures
[1:19:23] and the country was completely designed
[1:19:28] for white people to rule
[1:19:32] Blanco based on what many woke leaders
[1:19:35] believe and
[1:19:36] teachers
[1:19:39] whiteness and white supremacy
[1:19:42] now Reigns Supreme in all fats in all
[1:19:46] facets of our society
[1:19:48] yes
[1:19:52] now check this out even if you have no
[1:19:57] links to racism
[1:20:01] or white supremacy
[1:20:04] or the oppression of blacks
[1:20:08] you are complicit
[1:20:11] usted because
[1:20:13] she
[1:20:22] it's all it says all white people
[1:20:27] are the problem
[1:20:30] imagine that imaginese
[1:20:33] in a nutshell that's critical race
[1:20:35] Theory and that is what they're teaching
[1:20:38] is
[1:20:40] they they want they want to put a is an
[1:20:43] A oppressor and then and then
[1:20:46] exactly in the oppressed
[1:20:48] and bring it through the generations
[1:20:53] in the in the Civil War era or or during
[1:20:58] slavery period which was uh
[1:21:01] very bad period during our Empire as as
[1:21:04] a nation but bringing it to and still
[1:21:08] make sure that that person remains
[1:21:10] guilty right that's exactly right you
[1:21:12] know what I mean
[1:21:16] that's exactly right and
[1:21:19] what they're trying to do is
[1:21:22] take is take Vengeance
[1:21:26] they want their vengeance
[1:21:28] aora
[1:21:31] they're they're not waiting for anyone
[1:21:33] else to do it
[1:21:36] but they want their Vengeance now
[1:21:39] Romans 12 19 says
[1:21:43] and this is where we have to be very
[1:21:47] very diligent in what we believe
[1:21:53] he caught up in this very easily
[1:21:57] Romans 12 19 says dearly beloved
[1:22:02] avenge not yourselves
[1:22:05] but rather give Place unto Wrath
[1:22:08] for it is written vengeance is mine I
[1:22:12] will repay saith the Lord
[1:22:24] but what's amazing
[1:22:27] is that this is being taught in church
[1:22:33] this is being taught in mainstream
[1:22:36] churches
[1:22:38] this
[1:22:40] isn't just some random guy on the street
[1:22:42] corner
[1:22:46] mega churches are teaching this you know
[1:22:49] Iglesias grandis that that they need to
[1:22:53] have their Vengeance now
[1:22:58] wow
[1:22:59] but yeah
[1:23:03] in
[1:23:05] in the the word uh
[1:23:08] of
[1:23:09] back to
[1:23:11] woke if even though they're all
[1:23:13] interlaced
[1:23:17] it it is uh
[1:23:19] it its Origins are in marxismo
[1:23:27] from Marxism it was transferred to
[1:23:30] post-modernismo
[1:23:36] the people's way of thinking became uh
[1:23:41] they they believed uh the marxists
[1:23:43] believed that the consciousness of the
[1:23:45] people
[1:23:48] had to be raised to see the difference
[1:23:51] between them and capitalism
[1:23:57] and whoever was in power at that time
[1:24:04] through what was called progress
[1:24:07] discourses
[1:24:11] was the prevailing thought of that day
[1:24:16] this is an example
[1:24:21] Christianity and 800 A.D
[1:24:24] in
[1:24:27] said a gay man was a depraved sinner
[1:24:30] morally corrupt uh
[1:24:41] in 1900
[1:24:43] a gay man was considered insane it was a
[1:24:48] mental disorder in uh
[1:24:55] but in post-modernism
[1:24:59] 21st century
[1:25:02] liberalism liberalism became dominant
[1:25:06] and homosexuality became normal
[1:25:17] could I be the scripture yes
[1:25:20] description is very very clear on this
[1:25:23] is
[1:25:24] going to read it real quick
[1:30:48] we can go into this one and it's really
[1:30:50] going to get sticky
[1:30:53] horses but but and and you you forgive
[1:30:56] us in this sense
[1:30:57] but three lesbians uh initiated black
[1:31:01] lives matter
[1:31:09] that being being born an
[1:31:15] african-americano that's why they say I
[1:31:18] say they hijack all these terms
[1:31:22] if you're born hispanic white or
[1:31:25] African-American or whatever
[1:31:28] you can't have you can't it's it it it
[1:31:31] it is uh uh what's the term
[1:31:35] it's the way you were born
[1:31:38] it's it but they wanted to equivocate
[1:31:42] being lgbtq
[1:31:45] plus
[1:31:48] civil rights
[1:31:51] and it's not one and the same
[1:31:54] one is the way you were born
[1:31:57] the other is the choice
[1:32:06] all right
[1:32:07] okay
[1:32:08] so this this is why what you say is that
[1:32:13] in its Inception it it it it it it was a
[1:32:17] being woke is a it was was a good
[1:32:22] terms
[1:32:24] and again it's a religion
[1:32:29] and you got to go according to what is
[1:32:33] being expressed that that is
[1:32:36] but when scripture
[1:32:40] comes to us it doesn't use the word woke
[1:32:45] it uses the word awake
[1:32:49] and it says awake to righteousness
[1:32:57] for some have not the knowledge of God
[1:33:00] foreign
[1:33:07] you know now they're they're and you're
[1:33:09] gonna go we're going to another ball of
[1:33:12] a a thing that's going out that now that
[1:33:15] Roe versus Wade was overturned all right
[1:33:19] and now the sanctity of life there's no
[1:33:22] sanctity of life
[1:33:24] so many abortions Millions babies that
[1:33:28] have been aborted
[1:33:29] make the Holocaust look like like if it
[1:33:33] was just something casual yes
[1:33:39] people are just are just demonstrating
[1:33:42] everywhere
[1:33:44] because they want the woman's right
[1:33:48] to be able to abort and to be able to do
[1:33:53] this
[1:33:54] until the week that that baby is full
[1:33:57] term they could still terminate the
[1:34:00] pregnancy
[1:34:08] and people
[1:34:10] they stand for it but let me tell you we
[1:34:15] as the body of Believers
[1:34:17] believes in a new birth
[1:34:20] We Believe being justified by faith
[1:34:24] Sanctified in the experience
[1:34:27] with the Holy Ghost coming into the
[1:34:30] world and being born again
[1:34:36] but we believe that the spirit of God
[1:34:39] dwells inside of us
[1:34:43] the person
[1:34:45] of the Lord Jesus Christ lives inside of
[1:34:49] our hearts
[1:34:53] the greatest responsibility you have for
[1:34:56] your children
[1:34:59] they are they receive the new birth
[1:35:04] I would not do anything
[1:35:08] again
[1:35:10] amen they have no chance if they're not
[1:35:13] opportunity
[1:35:16] that's okay Ephesians 5 14
[1:35:20] or for he said awake thou that sleepest
[1:35:24] is
[1:35:28] and arise from the dead
[1:35:31] Christ shall give the light
[1:35:35] now you think of where this woman's
[1:35:38] rights thing came from a recipients
[1:35:43] and back in brother branham's time in
[1:35:46] the temple of Branham
[1:35:49] the last time brother Brenham voted in
[1:35:51] an election
[1:35:55] he voted for Mr Nick
[1:35:58] Nixon
[1:35:59] [Music]
[1:36:01] and he said a horrible thing's been done
[1:36:04] here in the United States
[1:36:12] permitted women to vote
[1:36:18] and they elected the wrong man
[1:36:22] correct that that in itself they could
[1:36:26] hang me out to dry just with that one
[1:36:29] statement imagine Brothers saying that
[1:36:31] in in the early 1960s
[1:36:37] Same Spirit is this God degenerating is
[1:36:40] degenerating more until now the woman
[1:36:43] can choose to abort her baby a week
[1:36:46] before she's going to ask
[1:36:52] and this nation was warned against all
[1:36:55] this is
[1:36:58] and the condition is because they
[1:37:00] rejected God's
[1:37:02] problems
[1:37:06] the prophet of God speaks to us
[1:37:09] he says one of the finest papers in the
[1:37:12] field
[1:37:14] The Herald of his coming
[1:37:19] that's fast pray fast pray fast prayer
[1:37:25] found a trumpet
[1:37:28] you see it all the time
[1:37:30] and you see the society and it's just a
[1:37:33] unquote now yes
[1:37:35] but back to the quote we're going to
[1:37:38] have a great breaking of the day
[1:37:43] do they do that
[1:37:45] why why do they do that
[1:37:49] they want a Great Awakening
[1:37:53] they're crying believing that there will
[1:37:56] be
[1:37:57] Awakening is
[1:38:01] they're good people why is it
[1:38:05] what have they done
[1:38:12] they have not recognized
[1:38:17] The Awakening of the Bride is
[1:38:24] they feel the pull of the hour
[1:38:27] but they haven't recognized what's been
[1:38:30] done
[1:38:32] that's what's making them feel that way
[1:38:35] is
[1:38:37] something is supposed to happen
[1:38:43] they're looking for it way off in the
[1:38:47] future is
[1:38:53] when it's already happened right by you
[1:38:58] that's why our pastor says
[1:39:01] I'm not looking for it
[1:39:06] because we are not woke we have always
[1:39:09] been the righteousness
[1:39:31] not go to war
[1:39:33] paranoid but come to Awakening
[1:39:37] do not go to the guilty
[1:39:40] to be an overcomer
[1:39:44] more than an overtime and it puts every
[1:39:48] person on the same plane toys
[1:39:52] that's why we go to Africa because we
[1:39:56] love our our African our black brothers
[1:40:02] because we love our White Brothers
[1:40:06] to Mexico because we love our Brown
[1:40:09] Brothers
[1:40:11] one of these days we'll go over to Tokyo
[1:40:15] one of these days we we are there are
[1:40:18] some people here that are Native
[1:40:19] Americans
[1:40:21] [Music]
[1:40:21] um
[1:40:39] can I say this one last statement okay
[1:40:43] you see you hear all these beautiful
[1:40:46] races these beautiful colors
[1:40:50] reminds you what the prophet says
[1:40:54] why it's God's beautiful bouquet of
[1:40:57] flowers
[1:40:59] Las Flores
[1:41:05] De Flores
[1:41:08] God's beautiful
[1:41:10] flowers of every race every color it's a
[1:41:14] beautiful bouquet it goes what I don't
[1:41:16] know beautiful okay
[1:41:21] second current second Corinthians 5 17.
[1:41:27] it says therefore
[1:41:29] If any man be in Christ
[1:41:33] he is a new creature
[1:41:37] cuantos all things are passed away
[1:41:41] we don't have to worry about what
[1:41:43] happened years and years ago all things
[1:41:45] are passed away
[1:41:48] behold all things
[1:41:51] are become new
[1:41:57] I'll finish with it with this scripture
[1:42:00] Psalms 101
[1:42:08] before mine eyes
[1:42:10] I hate the work of them
[1:42:13] that turns that turn aside
[1:42:17] it shall not cleave to me
[1:42:21] a forward heart
[1:42:24] shall depart from me
[1:42:27] I will not know a wicked person no
[1:42:31] Pandora
[1:42:41] and the forward the word forward in the
[1:42:45] Hebrew yes
[1:42:47] [Music]
[1:42:49] said it in Spanish it's a perverse
[1:42:53] it means perverse significa perverso
[1:42:56] amen let us pray one for the other
[1:43:01] and uh pray for our children
[1:43:04] and some people when they come home from
[1:43:07] school and they come home grouchy
[1:43:12] now you might know a little bit what the
[1:43:15] pressures are going through

[1:43:20] you go to is
[1:43:22] it's a it's it's it's not the real
[1:43:26] church
[1:43:28] and then they tell them you're not who
[1:43:30] you say you are
[1:43:33] but I love the message
