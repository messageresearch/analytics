[7:35] law and he give him a prophet he give
[7:38] him a pillar of fire what did he do oh
[7:45] he said his church order a pillar of
[7:50] fire or spirit to lead them a poppet who
[7:52] had telling the truth of his word they
[7:55] were ready for the journey then isn't
[7:58] that wonderful how do you do the
[8:01] wilderness they went performing signs
[8:03] and wonders opening up the red sea

[8:23] he was ready to take his children in
[8:25] that's the first time he's ever called a

[8:39] him a sign and he's standing into the

[8:46] saw the pretty women
[8:48] a lukewarm Church with gods and
[8:54] goddesses and everything else what did
[8:57] they do
[8:58] went for him married in among them
[9:02] that's right exactly right I imagine
[9:06] those pretty little morganite women
[9:08] they're really beautiful
[9:09] I got a prophecy laying at home well
[9:11] these days I'm gonna read it you wonder
[9:12] why
[9:13] rapid women over 30 years ago
[9:18] I've got thus saith the Lord 30 years
[9:23] ago and I into the ministry he told me
[9:25] that the strain of women but he comes to
[9:27] him more leading puted in the last ASA
[9:29] to be the most defiled thing on the
[9:31] earth right she started at the beginning
[9:34] and Satan user at the Union look what is
[9:37] happening look down through the years
[9:38] said she'll continue to strip her self
[9:40] and said they'll just be a little tiny
[9:43] group of the very elected that's
[9:45] predestinated will escape that when that
[9:48] vision come I've worried me I saw women
[9:50] I've turned back over the Bible now I
[9:52] was a to be the fifth chapter said the
[9:54] grace that has escaped from the
[9:56] daughters of Zion and that day will be
[9:57] beautiful to the law a woman wrote me a
[10:02] question if it he she's heading brother
[10:05] Brad or no it's a man minister maybe
[10:08] stand here this morning just Mohan and
[10:11] he said we want to say the same thing
[10:12] you do but we found something on your
[10:14] tapes it's not right
[10:16] so Billy brought the letter to me said
[10:19] something on your tapes says it's very
[10:21] contradictory brother branham through
[10:23] the Word of God and we won't if we want
[10:24] to say the same thing said one question
[10:26] I want to say to you that's first
[10:27] Corinthians the labor chapter and it
[10:31] says that about the head covering for
[10:33] the women and the man not to have cover
[10:34] II said we believe that the women should
[10:36] wear hats in the church and the man
[10:38] should pick your hats off in the church
[10:39] say we believe them head coverings and
[10:41] so forth it said then another question
[10:43] is that the people come to us and say
[10:44] the angel of the Lord speaks everything
[10:46] to you every word that you speak is from
[10:48] the angel of the Lord and brother Rand
[10:50] is so hard to fight against something
[10:51] like that said in my church said we want
[10:54] to see the same thing our brother
[10:55] Branham know
[10:56] you believe it she was a little an error
[10:57] there I'll wrote back my precious
[11:00] brother I'm not an error the first
[11:03] Corinthians 11 chapter said a woman
[11:06] should have her head covered and why
[11:08] then the 15th verse said her long hair
[11:11] is given to her fara covered not a hat
[11:16] Catholic spirits dominated the church
[11:18] long enough where long hair is her
[11:21] covering don't hate yourself and look
[11:24] and then the question come back somebody
[11:27] asked me some time ago I'll explain it
[11:28] while I'm at it he said well the Bible
[11:30] said that she should have long hair
[11:32] because of the Angels what's the Angels
[11:33] got to do as a woman I said what is an
[11:36] angel
[11:36] it's a messenger what's Paul saying if a
[11:40] true messenger an angel from God comes
[11:43] by you better have long hair he'll
[11:46] condemn the thing Johnny I mean he's got
[11:50] no was an angel this messenger
[11:53] iMessage you're sent when God will
[11:55] condemn it said you better have long
[11:57] hair because of the Angels then
[11:59] messenger sent from God comes by Oh
[12:01] condemneth II yes indeedy because a real
[12:04] messenger from God rachel is connected
[12:06] with God his word can't fail the exactly
[12:09] right st. Paul said there that if even
[12:12] an angel from heaven come told anything
[12:14] else but he'd been cursed and right now
[12:17] we find out that that's true she should
[12:19] have long hair that's recovering but I
[12:22] imagine these pretty moba night women
[12:24] were very beautiful they might have been
[12:26] fixed upside some look modern and Jessie
[12:28] bells of the day but however not all
[12:31] women I think a woman that's genuine is
[12:35] a jewel praise God firmly a woman God's
[12:42] hands made but a real woman is like a
[12:45] real man then follow the Word of God
[12:47] regardless of what the devil says really
[12:50] false things said our pastor said it's
[12:52] alright to do this don't care what your
[12:54] pastor said if it's contrary to God's
[12:55] Word let his word be a lie keep God's
[12:58] Word okay what denomination is or what
[13:01] he is these guys things day by coming
[13:03] look into the
[13:03] of God exactly oh hi we could go on down
[13:08] and see God separating and we're gonna
[13:10] have to stop isn't it you got some
[13:11] scriptures your water just by pace it to
[13:13] get it hurry up to get to the end then
[13:16] what happened when he taking place there
[13:19] when the moment night women God had to
[13:21] separate him again
[13:22] what did he do then came Jesus now we're
[13:27] we're coming somewhere then came Jesus
[13:30] the Express image of God the woman see
[13:34] conceived by God himself the great
[13:39] architect built himself a body he didn't
[13:41] have to borrow a timber from anybody
[13:43] woman harmony he built himself a house
[13:48] oh I think of Stephens on that day when
[13:53] he stood said juice uncircumcised and
[13:56] heart and ears you stiff Nick's you
[13:59] always resist the Holy Ghost like your
[14:00] fathers did so you said Solomon building
[14:03] the house but I bet the Most High don't
[14:05] live in houses made with hands but a
[14:08] body has had to bar any chambers
[14:13] anywhere Hebrews the legend chapter I
[14:16] believe in the second or third verse
[14:17] says that the world was framed by the
[14:20] Word of God the things were made out of
[14:23] things that don't appear God just said
[14:25] let there be in there was he didn't have
[14:28] for say mr. moon would you know me a
[14:30] little timber mr. Stahr would you let me
[14:32] have some towson god don't do that he
[14:35] didn't have say Mary you know me an egg
[14:37] I want to make the body so I drilled in
[14:40] it God the Creator spoke and she was a
[14:43] mother she was the mother she was just a
[14:47] woman bearing his seed now trying to
[14:49] remember she was not Jesus mother the
[14:53] world said so find me one place of
[14:55] scripture every taller mother now come
[14:59] back to the word mother of God
[15:01] shame on you one day some people said
[15:05] Jim said your mother's outside looking
[15:07] for you said who is my mother
[15:09] looked over his disciples said they they
[15:12] do the will of my father is my mother
[15:14] she was his mother she was a incubator
[15:19] God could use something else but he want
[15:22] to take the very lowest is sure what he
[15:24] could do with it
[15:25] raise it up make something out of
[15:28] nothing that's God expressed image come
[15:32] Jesus the Mackley upon the lovely one
[15:35] the fairest of ten thousand to lily of
[15:37] the valley the Rose of Sharon all the
[15:39] Morningstar
[15:40] what was he what did he come for listen
[15:43] close now to re-establish oneness
[15:47] between God and man did you see it
[15:52] brother all their towers of Babel and
[15:56] all their other things back there didn't
[15:58] work all their fruits the gardens and
[16:00] everything else displease God so God
[16:02] came down and was conceived in the womb
[16:05] of a woman by his own self made himself
[16:07] a body and become Emmanuel God with us
[16:10] neither Jew nor Gentile but God he
[16:15] wasn't you he wasn't Gentile he was God
[16:18] the Gentiles are just as much to him at
[16:21] anytime or he tried to separate a Jew
[16:23] for a nation you tried to everything to
[16:24] get it back to the only way he could
[16:26] establish it was come back to an
[16:28] individual like he was at the beginning
[16:29] that's the way it is today to an
[16:31] individual not to a denomination not to
[16:33] an organization not to a group of people
[16:35] but to an individual notice to
[16:39] reestablish oneness between God and man
[16:42] he was a real sin offering sheep goats
[16:45] and so forth could never take away sin
[16:47] but the life the cause when the
[16:49] sacrifice is killed in the life of a
[16:52] lamb the most innocent thing could not
[16:54] come back that life of only believer
[16:56] because he was a human being with a soul
[16:58] and the Sheep has no soul the nothing
[17:01] has to solve it man God put is the
[17:03] animal farm that's true but he put a
[17:05] soul Oni that's what made him different
[17:07] than the animals he know right from
[17:08] wrong when his soul come along but he
[17:10] remember when God created man in his own
[17:12] image and then he became a living soul
[17:14] he became that knowing right from wrong
[17:16] now notice but now in this Jesus came
[17:21] and he was God not only the life of
[17:24] another man could come back on another
[17:26] man but the very life of God making him
[17:28] a child of God put me back into the same
[17:30] union he was before the fall now we're
[17:33] getting to real ones
[17:36] people somebody says to me hey brother
[17:38] buddy might you oneness not the
[17:40] organization won this but I'm oneness
[17:42] with Christ but not the organization
[17:44] wonders he paid the debt of sin now in
[17:47] order to get oneness between God and man
[17:50] Jesus could not do it as long as he was
[17:52] here in a body of flesh so he had to
[17:55] become the complete sin offering to take
[17:57] away the guilt of the believer he'd
[17:59] taken away so that the Holy Ghost could
[18:02] come into man and make man and God
[18:05] oneness again see there had to be
[18:07] something to reestablish now what could
[18:10] re-establish when God's commandment is
[18:12] fulfilled could an angel fulfill it he
[18:15] has no blood could God a fulfill it
[18:18] he had no blood and God became flesh and
[18:21] blood in order that he could pay the
[18:23] debt correctly and take away sin because
[18:26] that's the only way towers of Babel
[18:28] separating across the earth everything
[18:30] else organizations and things that
[18:32] failed in every way they get mixed up
[18:34] together the world and everything else
[18:35] but this was going to be a total
[18:36] separation Lauren I feel religious well
[18:42] I feel like I take my text and I start
[18:44] preaching right now just get warmed up
[18:46] now to where I can get started right
[18:47] here it's time we stop hmm maybe I'll
[18:50] finish it later sometimes the oneness of
[18:53] God and man do you understand all that
[18:56] understand say a man see that's the only
[18:59] way that man could be back in his
[19:02] original state again is for that penalty
[19:05] of sin to be paid the penalty of sin is
[19:09] why death wages of sin is death and God
[19:13] said the day you eat thereof the day
[19:15] that you had this affair that's the day
[19:16] you'll die and when he did it broke his
[19:19] relationship fellowship and everything
[19:21] from man it could not come back anymore
[19:23] until that penalty was paid and nobody
[19:26] was worthy to pay it because everyone
[19:28] fell with the human being goes every
[19:30] creatures under the human
[19:31] and he was falling we've need this for
[19:41] the night huh under the penalty of death
[19:45] brother Mack you're used to be pastor to
[19:48] the tabernacle when I left now another
[19:52] good old Baptist missionary baptist down
[19:54] there they got the holy go see notice
[19:56] now they come into the oneness with God
[19:59] now when we see this see the penalty
[20:03] must be paid and know the highest form
[20:06] of animal life is a human being and the
[20:09] human being fell itself so how can one
[20:13] human save another it taken God and God
[20:20] in spirit cannot die so God had to bring
[20:24] yourself a little lower than the Angels
[20:26] Hebrews the first chapters had to make
[20:30] yourself lower than the Angels in order
[20:32] to take death to pay the penalty the
[20:34] brains of oneness between man and God
[20:36] again so the Holy Ghost to come man the
[20:40] deadest sin was paid Jesus had to do
[20:42] this to sender the the Holy Ghost back
[20:45] up on didn't unite people again like it
[20:47] wasn't a Garden of Eden the debt was
[20:49] paid when Jesus died that sounded hey if
[20:56] I could only get it to soak in that debt
[20:59] is paid to the Letham that death is paid
[21:07] and every man and woman here in D this
[21:10] morning or will hear me mother take your
[21:12] penalty is paid don't you disbelieve
[21:15] God's word I can't come back to the word
[21:21] don't believe it he was the word boy I
[21:25] feel like shout monster do the penalty
[21:29] is paid it's all over no wonder angel
[21:32] screams Oh
[21:34] anthems of heaven reaction Hey
[21:39] the lost sheep was found a propitiation
[21:42] was made for you to be restored again oh
[21:45] the waters of separation God's word that
[21:48] Washington from his iniquity when the
[21:50] word died in my place they believed as
[21:53] erected again and then come reminisce in
[21:55] my life hey it's over we are redeemed
[22:03] not by a Catholic Church although we are
[22:07] the correct Catholic yes not Roman
[22:11] Catholic with their dogmas they didn't
[22:13] hide this word but their dog
[22:14] everything's are you Donovan not the
[22:17] word Methodist Baptist shame on lovers
[22:21] of iniquity more than lovers of God
[22:23] lovers of pleasure world seekers
[22:26] pleasures slaughtered pigs for the pen
[22:30] available were standing as instruments
[22:33] out there choking that stuff dunya like
[22:34] Satan in the Garden of Eden well our
[22:37] ministers have got an education they got
[22:39] the PhD ll they don't mean a thing how
[22:42] that word is still a trick of the devil
[22:45] I've proved it to you by the word that's
[22:47] not be up to you for now the disciples
[22:53] even walking with Jesus they didn't have
[22:55] no oneness they didn't have any unity
[22:58] Paul they argued who's going to be
[23:00] bishop after this who's the greatest
[23:03] among us they couldn't even believe
[23:06] Jesus they can understand him thou
[23:08] speakest and riddles tell us plainly
[23:11] what you need
[23:12] there was no unity between Jesus and the
[23:14] disciples and cypress to Jesus and the
[23:16] flag was among one another no matter
[23:18] that goes to show you brother listen
[23:22] close now I want this to stick real deep

[23:42] holy holy holy makes no difference at
[23:45] all if one word of God's Bible is denied
[23:49] it's of the devil

[23:55] God from nude Old Testament now bring
[23:57] your own down to the day if you Lissette
[23:59] with me if you lose the disciples who
[24:03] walk hand and hand with Jesus slept with
[24:07] thee eat with thee once these miracles
