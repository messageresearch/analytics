[25:56] oh save me according to thy mercy
[26:02] ayudame
[26:10] and you can take your seats
[26:16] uh so I just had a little uh thought
[26:19] tonight
[26:22] and um I want to go back to when we had
[26:25] went to Mexico City back in July
[26:33] and um
[26:35] so I was
[26:37] um oh it was like a week before the
[26:40] services
[26:44] uh I was just kind of you know at home
[26:48] and at the time I was doing some work
[26:51] and just different things
[26:56] and uh something kept telling me
[26:59] uh I heard a voice in my head that kept
[27:01] telling me well you know both
[27:06] and it kept saying
[27:08] yeah
[27:10] make sure that you're ready
[27:14] and you know at the time I was just
[27:17] thinking myself ready for what you know
[27:23] uh so as the weekend comes for the
[27:26] Mexico City meetings
[27:31] we had gotten on the plane
[27:36] and uh under you know seated down
[27:40] and uh again I heard the same thing you
[27:44] know
[27:46] it said make sure that you're ready
[27:50] so then I was thinking to myself well
[27:52] you know the services are coming up I'm
[27:54] assuming get ready for that is
[28:01] but in my head I was like oh there's no
[28:02] way I'm gonna go up there and speak
[28:08] you know it's Mexico City you'll
[28:10] probably sure have some brothers from
[28:11] out of town that'll speak I won't go up
[28:13] there yeah
[28:17] well I thought wrong
[28:19] and brother Kayla said can you go up
[28:22] there and give your testimony
[28:28] so I said oh well you know he meant
[28:30] ready for that oh
[28:35] so I got up there and I you know gave my
[28:38] testimony
[28:42] and you know I spoke about how
[28:45] I came from two different households you
[28:47] know
[28:51] and that my dad was struggling a lot
[28:54] with you know drugs and alcohol
[29:00] so uh after I had
[29:04] after uh the service had ended
[29:08] I think it was like a Saturday night or
[29:12] something like that
[29:15] I was talking to
[29:17] why was there in like a little group
[29:19] with a couple of these young guys
[29:22] and we you know we're just talking
[29:24] getting to know each other and stuff you
[29:25] know
[29:29] and one of them uh was right here on my
[29:32] right side
[29:34] and I don't remember his name or his
[29:36] face
[29:39] but I do remember he said he was like a
[29:41] year younger than me foreign
[29:46] and uh he looks at me and he gets my
[29:49] shoulder like this
[29:53] and his eyes start tearing up
[29:57] and my first thought was oh man did I
[30:00] say something or hurt his feelings
[30:07] and I was like in my head I was thinking
[30:09] oh my God I was trying to like remember
[30:11] what I had said because I don't know if
[30:12] I said something to offend him
[30:17] so anyways um he looks at me and he says
[30:23] he said brother the testimony that you
[30:25] gave is
[30:28] the exact same situation that's going on
[30:30] in my household
[30:34] and I just I was thinking to myself like
[30:37] wow like that's just crazy
[30:43] and he was saying you know all the the
[30:46] words of wisdom that God gave you and
[30:48] that you spoke it out
[30:54] uh he said now I know now I know uh now
[30:59] I found the balance that I needed in my
[31:00] life
[31:05] and he says
[31:07] um that's that's how I got this that
[31:09] verse
[31:13] was from him
[31:16] because he was uh he was telling me that
[31:19] he was kind of like getting into the
[31:22] message you know
[31:26] you know his his mom was in the message
[31:30] and you know his dad was out there
[31:34] and he was saying you know I I don't
[31:36] know what to do
[31:39] he goes the only thing that I've heard
[31:41] was the song uh to read psalms 109 26.
[31:48] and he said oh I just kept I kept on
[31:51] asking the Lord to help me
[31:56] um
[31:56] because you know he was thinking that it
[31:58] was his fault you know
[32:01] and he goes you know brother I I really
[32:06] needed help and I didn't know who to go
[32:07] to or what to do
[32:12] and he says but I believe that God sent
[32:15] you
[32:18] to give that testimony to help me and my
[32:20] family
[32:24] and and you know I I was just I was just
[32:27] lost for words
[32:30] because I you know I
[32:33] it's just crazy how you're you know
[32:35] saying just your testimony
[32:41] you know maybe you don't realize it no
[32:44] realizable you know even if it's just
[32:47] one person
[32:49] you know it has a big impact on their
[32:51] life
[32:53] so I was just you know in my mind I was
[32:56] just like thank you Lord you know
[32:59] gracias and
[33:02] um
[33:03] so then I told him you know
[33:06] told them but don't don't just stop
[33:09] there no no
[33:11] I said you you pray for your dad you
[33:15] know
[33:15] he'll get into the message
[33:19] and I said I know what I'm telling you
[33:21] because I've gone I'm going through the
[33:23] same thing you'll say look look at this
[33:24] is
[33:27] and I told them you know you're going to
[33:29] pray and pray and pray for your family
[33:30] your dad
[33:33] and at the same time see it's gonna come
[33:35] right in your ear
[33:39] and tell you you know your dad's not
[33:42] gonna make it
[33:44] or you and your family aren't going to
[33:46] make it
[33:48] and I told them but don't believe that
[33:51] don't listen to that stuff
[33:55] because
[33:56] even though you know your dad's had his
[33:58] struggles
[34:02] you know he's human like all of us
[34:05] and at the end you know he has a soul
[34:10] and I said that's uh just like me and my
[34:13] dad
[34:14] that's a soul that you need to win to
[34:17] the Lord
[34:19] and I said you know it's going to get
[34:22] tough and tougher
[34:26] and maybe you feel like you just want to
[34:29] give up
[34:31] maybe sometimes you really feel like it
[34:34] won't happen
[34:38] but that's when you get up is and you
[34:42] just dust yourself off
[34:44] and you say satanas it will happen
[34:49] because he's part of the Lord's plan
[34:51] God's plan
[34:53] and after that you know he just he
[34:55] really started just not like crying and
[34:58] crying but he was just tearing up really
[34:59] bad you know
[35:04] and he just said you know thank you
[35:06] brother for your testimony
[35:09] said it really really good
[35:13] so you know like I said just saying you
[35:15] know just
[35:16] your testimony
[35:18] you know it could really impact somebody
[35:22] you might not even know it is
[35:29] [Applause]
[35:43] foreign
[35:50] God bless you this evening
[35:53] you all look very beautiful this evening
[35:57] if we could please stand for the reading
[35:59] of God's word
[36:06] we're going to turn to the scripture uh
[36:08] Isaiah 43.
[36:10] is
[36:13] verses one and two verses
[36:16] any reason but now thus saith the Lord
[36:18] that created the order
[36:25] oh Jacob and he that formed thee foreign
[37:24] share a little bit about
[37:27] my experience
[37:30] and my experiences that followed after
[37:33] that is
[37:36] for those of you that don't know I was
[37:38] born and raised in Phoenix Arizona
[37:43] Phoenix Arizona I'm in this beautiful
[37:46] message that we have
[37:50] I wasn't technically brought up in this
[37:53] message
[37:56] you could say that I came from the
[37:58] outside
[38:01] the life that I was living was was not a
[38:04] good life at all
[38:07] but thank God that there was one day
[38:11] progress
[38:14] somehow the algun Manera in this thick
[38:18] head of mine that I have
[38:20] tengo and in such a cold heart that I
[38:23] had at the time
[38:27] I'll tell you there's nowhere that God
[38:29] cannot go yeah
[38:33] he put a fire so hot in my heart
[38:38] I could no longer ignore him
[38:42] uh to give you a little detail and
[38:43] background
[38:47] it was the year of 2017.
[38:51] many don't know this
[38:54] but at the time I was actually Afflicted
[38:57] with with the disease
[39:02] I mean the doctors told me that I had to
[39:04] be on medication the rest of my life
[39:11] um I went into a really bad dark
[39:13] depression yeah
[39:16] my wife at the time she was she was
[39:19] there every step of the way with me
[39:24] and there was just something that
[39:27] sparked in my heart in my mind
[39:31] when I was younger my grandma would
[39:33] always tell us the testimony of hers
[39:35] yeah
[39:43] and at this time it would come back to
[39:45] me over and over and over again
[39:49] she would always tell me about the time
[39:51] that she had cancer is
[39:55] and she was so proud when she would tell
[39:57] me this is
[40:00] she said mijo I went to the doctor one
[40:02] time
[40:05] they told me I had cancer medicine
[40:11] and I believe that I was healed
[40:15] she said I was healed
[40:18] and that always stuck with me
[40:21] so at the time living in Phoenix
[40:26] I would get online and watch Services
[40:31] it wasn't a coincidence the first
[40:33] service that I watched
[40:36] it was the very first message of
[40:38] restoration of the bright tree
[40:44] and I believe that's me
[40:48] um you know I gave my life to the Lord
[40:54] um I and I asked him I said Lord if you
[40:56] hear me I'll serve you the rest of my
[40:57] life
[41:02] but the funny thing is
[41:05] he said no you're going to serve me the
[41:07] rest of your life
[41:10] and I'm going to heal you
[41:13] um you know after I gave my life to the
[41:16] Lord and I moved here to Las Cruces
[41:22] um the battle wasn't over no terminal if
[41:26] anything it the battle got even more hot
[41:28] and heavy for him
[41:31] um I went through and I'm still going
[41:33] through many birth pains to this day
[41:38] there's a struggling nature inside of us
[41:44] that we battled daily yeah
[41:49] Paul says I Die daily
[41:54] daily we face this enemy uh the area
[41:58] and we know that brother Brown says that
[42:01] our greatest enemy is ourselves

[42:10] Genesis
[42:13] and thy seed shall possess the Gate of
[42:16] his enemies

[43:42] disputed enemy
[43:45] we are defeating with a we're disputing
[43:48] with a conquered enemy estamos
[43:52] amen my question to you all tonight
[43:57] maybe you haven't died yet
[44:01] maybe there's a gate that's standing in
[44:04] your way
[44:07] I know that I'm not the only one that
[44:09] struggles
[44:12] I know there's many struggles
[44:16] and many of us have a gate with the name
[44:18] on it
[44:22] what's the name of your gate tonight
[44:28] the lord gave us the key to these Gates
[44:32] is your gate sickness
[44:37] what's the key to that so
[44:41] by his stripes
[44:43] Sammy's Hills Ronnie estanado
[44:48] is your gait anxiety or depression
[44:50] depression
[44:53] the joy of the Lord
[44:56] is my strength yes
[45:01] the joy of the Lord is Sami strength
[45:08] I went through a little uh just to give
[45:11] a short testimony
[45:14] these past couple weeks I actually went
[45:16] through a really bad uh
[45:20] I don't know what you would call it
[45:21] depression
[45:24] depression
[45:25] there was actually a tormenting spirit
[45:29] that was over me at the time
[45:34] and you know it's the little things that
[45:37] we leave out
[45:39] that keep these Spirits bound is
[45:46] I had talked to my pastor uh
[45:49] pastor and you know I was trying to get
[45:52] everything big out of the way
[45:58] to deal with this enemy or this gate but
[46:03] my pastor had told me Pastor to go make
[46:07] things right with a certain
[46:10] Persona and you know I'm scrambling here
[46:12] and there trying to deal with this every
[46:14] day
[46:17] and I'm putting that in the back burner
[46:19] in my mind
[46:22] at the end of the week
[46:26] I'm going down the list and I'm saying I
[46:28] did this this this is
[46:35] and the Lord tells me you forgot to do
[46:37] this here yes
[46:41] such a small thing
[46:44] but that small thing that I left out
[46:49] that small thing was keeping this nasty
[46:52] demon of Torment yes
[46:57] it was allowing it to stay around me
[47:02] and no matter how much I prayed
[47:06] how much I spoke to him
[47:09] he was there because there was a way for
[47:12] him to get in
[47:17] now uh
[47:19] Friday night the Deliverance service
[47:25] our pastor told us and challenged us
[47:31] so go make things right with anyone that
[47:33] you have wrong
[47:35] person
[47:38] he said or even if you know someone has
[47:40] something against you
[47:44] let's go make things right
[47:47] in that night I did that yes
[47:50] and I'm telling you church I felt such a
[47:53] Deliverance
[47:59] I've never felt such a freedom
[48:05] at the very moment that I made things
[48:07] right
[48:10] that spirit that demon has no more
[48:12] controller power over me
[48:16] so I'll make that same challenge to you
[48:18] tonight
[48:21] if there's something small in your way
[48:24] maybe the gate is small
[48:29] but that key is very simple tonight
[48:33] just take God at his words
[48:41] [Applause]
[48:55] thank you
[49:02] foreign
[49:49] thank you Lord
[49:50] let's turn to Ephesians chapter 2
[49:55] and we'll start with verse 1.
[50:01] I'll read all the verses in English and
[50:03] then you can read them okay
[50:05] okay and it says and Aaron hathy
[50:07] quickened who was dead and trespasses
[50:09] and sins
[50:10] wherein times past Aaron walked
[50:12] according to the course of this world
[50:14] according to the prince of the power of
[50:16] the air the spirit that worketh now and
[50:19] the children of Disobedience among whom
[50:22] also
[50:23] Aaron had all his conversations and time
[50:25] passed in the lusts of his flesh
[50:27] fulfilling the the desires of the Flesh
[50:30] and of his mind
[50:31] and we're by Nature the children of
[50:34] Wrath even as others but God who was
[50:37] rich in Mercy for his love wherein he
[50:40] loved Aaron even when he was dead in sin
[50:42] hath quickened Aaron together in Christ
[50:45] by his grace Aaron is saved
[50:49] foreign
[51:27] foreign
[51:52] I'm just relying on the Lord right now
[51:57] but this thought came to me
[52:00] we're either gonna kill or we're going
[52:02] to be killed
[52:05] you know we have a real enemy that's out
[52:10] and it's good that we had the week-long
[52:12] services yes
[52:16] a lot of us died out to ourselves
[52:21] but that has to keep going now
[52:25] you see because Satan he don't care how
[52:28] how you come to church and how you start
[52:30] feeling good
[52:35] he's ready to attack you as soon as you
[52:37] get your blessing
[52:41] and you know the thought just came to me
[52:44] we've got to seal up the leaks in our
[52:46] lives
[52:49] how is it that we can come and we can
[52:52] get a blessing of God
[52:55] and before you know it the blessing is
[52:58] gone as quick as we got here
[53:03] and I believe it comes down to what we
[53:05] heard on Sunday
[53:08] Heavenly place isn't isn't just sitting
[53:10] here in church
[53:13] it's not when you young people come to
[53:15] youth meeting
[53:19] though it can be that
[53:21] but you can be in Heavenly places
[53:23] wherever you're at
[53:26] and it all comes down to having those
[53:29] three key elements that we heard about
[53:31] on Sunday
[53:35] Domingo who can tell me what
[53:37] has to be there in order for God to
[53:39] receive your worship
[53:44] there was three things
[53:49] we got temple temple
[53:51] alter Altar and the worshiper right
[53:57] t-a-w
[53:59] them
[54:00] they are
[54:02] yeah
[54:04] laughs
[54:06] yeah
[54:08] so you know I was thinking
[54:11] stop in sandal
[54:13] you know I was a little kid Como Nino
[54:16] I always used to feel like I didn't fit
[54:19] in anywhere
[54:21] um
[54:28] with my own family members
[54:33] with the other kids at school
[54:36] I didn't like to talk
[54:39] mucho and I just felt like there was
[54:42] something different about me
[54:45] and I remember when I'd be with all my
[54:48] cousins or whatever and we'd be you know
[54:50] playing or doing this for that
[54:57] I just always remember thinking like you
[55:00] can't do things that the other kids are
[55:01] doing
[55:04] [Music]
[55:05] and not that it was a bad thing or a
[55:08] good thing I just that's how I always
[55:09] felt
[55:13] and as I got a little bit older
[55:18] I remember I remember going to church on
[55:21] Wednesday nights
[55:25] and I think man why in the world was I
[55:28] born into this uh this message
[55:35] why do I have to come to church on
[55:37] Wednesday nights
[55:40] I used to love playing sports
[55:44] I remember my mom would pick me up from
[55:47] practice and I'd be changing in our our
[55:49] car on the way to church
[55:56] and I hated it
[55:59] I always thought man why can't I be like
[56:01] my friends and just be a Catholic
[56:03] Pennsylvania
[56:07] not that it's bad
[56:11] but I mean I would go to church with him
[56:12] and you uh should they wear casual
[56:16] clothes
[56:21] after church the parents would get
[56:23] together and drink and party is
[56:27] and the kids could just do whatever they
[56:30] wanted because their parents were all
[56:31] getting drunk
[56:35] no I thought man this was the family I
[56:38] was supposed to be born in I remember I
[56:39] had a friend named Noah
[56:42] and I always think man this I was
[56:45] supposed to be like this guy yes it is
[56:49] and they could go through live get away
[56:52] with whatever they wanted yes this is
[56:57] and before you knew it I was just living
[56:59] that same way
[57:03] I didn't want to Fellowship have
[57:05] fellowship with the mystery like we
[57:07] heard on Sunday
[57:10] I didn't care to be around the Youth of
[57:13] the church
[57:16] when we would have uh fundraisers I'd go
[57:19] hide so that my friends wouldn't see me
[57:20] outside of Walmart washing cars
[57:29] Amigos
[57:31] just to put it plainly
[57:33] from church the youth
[57:36] um
[57:39] and uh and it just stuck with me till I
[57:42] got older I mean I was probably a
[57:45] junior in high school yes
[57:52] and like I said I continue playing
[57:54] sports and just continuing
[57:57] besides me coming to church I was not a
[58:00] Christian I didn't care to serve God
[58:04] and one night I was uh I've had the day
[58:07] written down like it was in April our I
[58:11] just turned 18.
[58:14] oh I know it was the day that uh Saddam
[58:18] Hussein was killed
[58:23] and I was in a car accident
[58:28] I had uh pretty much stolen my mom's car
[58:31] without asking
[58:36] because I wanted to be the cool guy at
[58:38] prom and take a vehicle
[58:41] muchacho
[58:42] important
[58:45] wind up getting in a rollover car
[58:47] accident that it was that morning
[58:49] probably
[58:54] three four in the morning
[58:57] my mom gets a knock at the door
[59:01] and there's two police officers stand
[59:04] there was it too or yeah
[59:07] and they said yes are you or Charlotte
[59:09] Esquibel yeah
[59:12] and she said yes you'll see and they say
[59:16] well your son just been in a terrible
[59:18] car accident
[59:23] and he's in the hospital
[59:26] well on my end
[59:29] party I don't remember anything
[59:32] all I remember is waking up in the
[59:34] hospital
[59:38] my all my immediate family was around me
[59:41] crying
[59:44] and I didn't know how bad of a condition
[59:46] I was in you know
[59:49] I just remember trying to console
[59:51] everybody like no I'm gonna be okay
[59:55] and here I was all busted up
[59:59] my hair was all blown off from the
[1:00:01] airbag
[1:00:06] my brain was bleeding out
[1:00:10] and I remember just that ended up taking
[1:00:13] me to the hospital
[1:00:17] well long story short I ended up
[1:00:20] recovering
[1:00:23] I had to have a brain surgery
[1:00:26] I had a surgery on my brain
[1:00:29] and I thought man I'm I'm good to go
[1:00:33] so my senior year rolled around you
[1:00:36] thought I would have straightened myself
[1:00:37] out yeah
[1:00:42] no I probably got worse
[1:00:45] and what's crazy is I'll never forget I
[1:00:47] was sitting somewhere over here
[1:00:51] and I had just started coming back to
[1:00:54] church actually my whole family just
[1:00:55] started coming back to church
[1:01:00] Satan was just having his way in our
[1:01:02] lives
[1:01:06] it got to a point where we were just
[1:01:08] spiritually dead as a family
[1:01:12] and I believe brother Rod Rhodey was
[1:01:16] visiting one time
[1:01:20] and after he was done preaching brother
[1:01:22] Tommy Jr started song leading is
[1:01:27] and I just remember he said uh you know
[1:01:30] if the Lord has done something for you
[1:01:31] just stand to your feet
[1:01:36] and again I had never cried in church I
[1:01:38] never raised my hands I never did
[1:01:42] and that day man something just ignited
[1:01:45] in me and I stood to my feet and I just
[1:01:47] started raising my hands yesterday
[1:01:53] and I had never heard my parents really
[1:01:55] cry in church or my family
[1:01:58] like the whole family started crying
[1:02:06] and I believe that day I started dying
[1:02:09] yes
[1:02:11] but I wasn't completely dead
[1:02:15] and you know
[1:02:17] you all know that I'm a nurse and
[1:02:19] there's a process to dying
[1:02:25] and I'm talking more people who are
[1:02:27] terminally ill yes
[1:02:32] or somebody who's reached the end of
[1:02:34] life
[1:02:37] so like the first thing that happens is
[1:02:39] you'll see a change in their appearance
[1:02:44] their skin starts to change colors
[1:02:46] [Music]
[1:02:48] the next source is
[1:02:56] and then it becomes like a burden to
[1:02:59] even eat it's rather than a joy illegal
[1:03:02] is
[1:03:05] and so anyways I just got to a point
[1:03:08] where you know that happened and fast
[1:03:10] forward you know two years
[1:03:15] not even that change
[1:03:19] brother Caleb asked me shortly after you
[1:03:21] know would you like to start parking
[1:03:23] cars
[1:03:29] but I was still hanging out with friends
[1:03:32] in the world yet coming to church and
[1:03:33] parking cars
[1:03:43] I'm serving the lord
[1:03:45] I can go hang out with friends
[1:03:49] then all of a sudden one day
[1:03:52] I started having these seizures
[1:03:57] and those of you that have been around
[1:03:59] when it happens
[1:04:03] it was just uh it totally rocked my
[1:04:05] world
[1:04:08] because I went from being just
[1:04:09] completely normal
[1:04:12] what I thought was normal
[1:04:16] to the point where I couldn't go
[1:04:18] anywhere by myself
[1:04:21] there was just always this fear like uh
[1:04:24] yeah you're gonna die
[1:04:27] and that feeling followed me everywhere
[1:04:32] first thing when I woke up in the
[1:04:34] morning
[1:04:35] you know my mind I go to bed like am I
[1:04:38] going to wake up to see the next morning
[1:04:41] because they always came in my sleep
[1:04:45] so just imagine you're trying to get
[1:04:48] some nice good sleep
[1:04:52] and you just wake up and I feel like
[1:04:54] somebody's choking you is
[1:05:01] all you have is yourself and your
[1:05:03] thoughts
[1:05:06] and at first I thought man I'd rather be
[1:05:09] dead than have to go through this
[1:05:13] and I had a terrible attitude towards it
[1:05:15] is
[1:05:17] yes until one day I thought you know
[1:05:19] what
[1:05:20] I can either just
[1:05:22] be like this the rest of my life
[1:05:26] or I can choose to get real with God
[1:05:31] so what I started doing is simple
[1:05:36] I started hearing the message of the
[1:05:38] Inner Man
[1:05:41] and in there brother Brown tells us that
[1:05:44] there's a man on the inside
[1:05:47] who feeds on things of the spirit
[1:05:51] and it really clicked with me because I
[1:05:54] loved working out
[1:05:58] and it's simple like you go to the gym
[1:06:00] why because you want to get bigger you
[1:06:02] want to get your muscles to grow you
[1:06:04] want to put weight on yes
[1:06:12] but on the inside I was just a little
[1:06:15] anorexic shriveled up man
[1:06:21] I wasn't in any condition to fight
[1:06:24] anything you understand conditions
[1:06:27] and so what I started doing is just
[1:06:29] hearing messages looking businesses
[1:06:32] and I write them out word for Words
[1:06:36] the greatest battle ever fought
[1:06:42] I'd hear song Services
[1:06:46] I got to the point where I wanted to
[1:06:49] start singing
[1:06:50] and I'd never done any of that before
[1:06:54] but I started to find out that I there
[1:06:57] was a God who actually cared about me
[1:07:02] I learned about how I felt
[1:07:19] I found out I didn't have any friends
[1:07:23] oh I could say I had hundreds of friends
[1:07:27] people go in the shop all the time and
[1:07:28] say oh I knew Aaron and this and that
[1:07:30] but
[1:07:32] amigos
[1:07:35] amigos I didn't have one friend
[1:07:38] but I had Jesus Christ
[1:07:41] and once I just started to get a real
[1:07:43] true intimate relationship with him
[1:07:45] [Music]
[1:07:48] I'd wake up every morning
[1:07:51] I'd go sit outside
[1:07:53] just pray
[1:07:56] and it's something real yeah I talked to
[1:08:00] him like like I talked to my wife
[1:08:04] he's my first love is me perimetamor and
[1:08:07] when you get to a point in your life
[1:08:09] where God is so much higher he's jealous
[1:08:12] he don't want to be shared with anybody
[1:08:14] or anything else
[1:08:21] and if you want things to go right in
[1:08:23] your life
[1:08:26] get to the point where God's more
[1:08:28] important than anything
[1:08:33] and it sounds easier just to say but
[1:08:36] as a young people we want to do things
[1:08:41] life is so new to us
[1:08:44] and a lot of times they say like oh well
[1:08:47] they're just saying that because they're
[1:08:48] already old and they they got to have
[1:08:50] their fun businesses
[1:08:57] no the reason that we tell you guys
[1:08:59] these things
[1:09:01] is because the world scars you
[1:09:16] [Music]
[1:09:26] and it's simple Yes simply you know one
[1:09:30] of you all came up to me on Sunday and
[1:09:32] asked me what is the sin question
[1:09:37] what is it can somebody yes
[1:09:42] no
[1:09:45] it's actually simple
[1:09:47] just ask yourself
[1:09:50] do I find more joy in the things of God
[1:09:52] than the things of the world
[1:09:57] where are you getting your joy from
[1:10:01] Carlos preached a message on that one
[1:10:03] time
[1:10:05] if I'm still out looking in the world to
[1:10:07] find joy in this for that
[1:10:12] it just shows I don't have joy
[1:10:15] but when I have Christ
[1:10:17] when I have the joy of the Lord
[1:10:20] that I can go do those things that we
[1:10:23] like like basketball or football or
[1:10:26] college whatever you want to do
[1:10:29] basketball football and you're not
[1:10:32] looking to find joy in it
[1:10:36] something like to do to pass the time
[1:10:41] but uh
[1:10:44] I believe that's just where I'm gonna
[1:10:46] stop this evening
[1:10:49] but just know that man once you just
[1:10:52] give your life over to God
[1:10:56] stop running
[1:10:59] and you find your position as a Son of
[1:11:01] God
[1:11:04] you'll look at your life
[1:11:07] all the hard things you have to go
[1:11:09] through maybe it's sickness
[1:11:17] and you realize it was all that gets you
[1:11:19] to a point
[1:11:23] where you can help somebody else
[1:11:26] all those all that sickness I had to go
[1:11:29] through
[1:11:30] I never would have knew that God was a
[1:11:33] Healer
[1:11:35] and I not have made all the mistakes in
[1:11:37] my life
[1:11:39] I never would have known that he could
[1:11:41] save me and
[1:11:44] that I just I'm humbled people
[1:11:47] and I just stand here today as just a
[1:11:50] mortal man just telling you is

[1:12:00] and somebody online if you needed to
[1:12:03] hear that see again

[1:12:08] heart
