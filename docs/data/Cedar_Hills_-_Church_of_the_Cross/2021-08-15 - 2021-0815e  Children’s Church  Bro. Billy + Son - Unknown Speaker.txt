that's it all right be careful for nothing but in everything sorry got myself off call myself our guards inside be careful for everything but in everything by prayer and supplication with thanksgiving let your request be made known unto god thank you so we're saying here is not to go live life like not to go living life like don't be careful and just be a fool what it's talking about is don't live your life on eggshells you know what eggshells are hey man you know what an egg is okay a little shall you crack your little white things you get them in your omelette and look crunchy okay what it means is you can't live life on eggshells you can't live your life in fear pretty much what it's saying you can't you bear not come on you is i'm gonna spend that in your house yeah okay okay you want

everything you do in prayer and supplication giving thanks thanksgiving not thanksgiving turkey dinner thanksgiving from your heart you make it me okay okay you're right anyways okay so the problem today is too many people put in one in hell before they put god first you understand little kids big kids bigger kids yeah so let me explain to you okay again that billy what okay you just you are too much so the thing is you can't put things before god you're getting serving a lot of trouble you understand what i'm telling you okay you start getting a little trouble you know what i'm talking about a little bit that's not you know what i'm talking about i know you're smiling i can't see your smile but i know he's mine you getting a lot of trouble you don't where your mom or your dad i'm gonna go ask him you lying to me you in church okay i think he's telling you he's telling truth i'll be there okay all right anything that you do more than the things of god god is not first in your life man you know what i'm telling you i'm talking anything you watch more tv more than you pray play on your games more than you read the bible anything you do you play outside more than you do that in first so then what happens when you go asking for help can't happen you getting it i got the little shelf wanna get you going [Laughter] okay maybe a little bit my legs still hurt okay yeah i'm gonna

angel what's his name okay brother branham hey you here okay who's the seventh angel i can't hear you who's seventh angel all right hey this isn't really singing you talking about age you know what you say doctor can't heal you i don't believe the doctor can't heal you okay hey can medicine heal you you know okay i don't know i'm going to trick you you think madison can heal you you don't know anymore okay okay don't get scared come on come on the only thing that a medicine or a doctor can do is aid yes you know what the aid is you remember what the aid is help oh there you go someone paying attention over here oh i thought it was you you know what madison does he told your answer are you that are you the man you speak espanol all right the only thing that the doctor in medicine can do is aid the only healer that there ever was in the history of the world is [Music] you must go to sunday school they teach you good praise god did you know that little billy little bill little bill no bill come on yeah you lucky i'm wearing a belt you supposed to be at example you teach them best best stuff yeah okay i'll give you a break okay how many here has the lord healed okay i guess you you you you never been sick you never been hurt you you okay we might go home because there's a lot of perfect people here we got maybe we did something bad you want me to tell you what happens every time you get sick every time you something kind of bad happens to you because god's trying to get your attention from something you see a headache and sickness only points to something yes you see the lord is gentleman god's a gentleman he won't force you to do nothing but he got ways of bringing you to your knees so make sure you put the first in first make sure you put god first and everything because if you forget he's going to remind you you know what's going to happen you have to put one of these on it's gonna hurt one and take it off so god's a healer right billy had a big gas right here let's see what happened sure everybody was there you know why the guy's a healer the only thing that medicine can do is aid the help of god but god is the cure so if you put all these things before god you can get in trouble yeah i know it you getting trouble up better put them first you get more trouble you understand what i'm saying little kids big kids weird kids ain't getting it they ain't getting us as lord heals you little billy yes go in town where the lord healed you from when i was riding my bike um i crashed and i had a big scrape here from to here and um how you know god healed you i i believed him now you understand what we're trying to tell you if you believe in him and put him first he becomes your healer you'll heal any you know any sickness that you'll ever have from right now to the end of your life the healing power already lies inside of you yes [Music] that's right because it gots to be personal i know when i usually get up here act a little foolish sometimes i get in trouble sometimes too i could at least pull back on me because sometimes i i'm putting first and i get in trouble so what i'm trying to tell you is in every area of your life he got to be first jesus got in the same person so you want to say jesus first god first same person okay he's got to be first you got a play box at home xbox you know what that is you know what

when you thought you weren't something but most important thing of all more you know that god's always watching you he always got his eye on you not that he's waiting for you to do something wrong he really knows what you're going to do is that he loves you so much is that he can't help to take his eyes off you is that he is in great expectation of what you are going to become one day until you little people until you could step up and when you say no to the world and yes to the ways of the lord jesus christ you're going to be able to say what the big kid said account you're going to be
