[50:14] difference and he answered and said unto
[50:16] them he that sth the good seed is the

[50:59] the tears are the children of the wicked

[51:31] and then we will start the
[51:36] message wait till you get
[51:42] it it says love not the
[51:45] world neither the things that are in the
[51:48] world go
[51:51] ahead if any man love the world the love
[51:55] of the father is not in
[52:00] him for all that is in the world the
[52:03] lust of the Flesh and the lust of the
[52:06] eyes and the pride of life is not of the
[52:10] father but is of the
[52:21] world may God add His blessings to the
[52:23] reading of his word you may be seated
[52:28] I haven't been here so brother Santiago
[52:30] and sister Maria God bless
[52:33] you God bless you it's good to have you
[52:35] with us this
[52:41] morning one thing we
[52:43] know in this
[52:47] world we are constantly being bombarded
[52:50] with
[52:53] seeds SE Goes Forth to sew
[52:57] and there are seeds being planted all
[53:00] the
[53:03] time yes or yes I don't know about you
[53:07] but both good and
[53:09] bad and the ones that we tend to take
[53:12] care of are the ones that
[53:15] grow
[53:17] yeah the ones we pay more attention to
[53:20] are the ones that ended up end up
[53:22] growing
[53:24] bigger and that is why I mentioned the
[53:27] last time our belief system is always
[53:31] changing because we allow so many
[53:34] different seeds to be planted in
[53:39] US am I talking to anyone
[53:42] here we are once again being bombarded
[53:45] constantly with
[53:48] seeds remember thoughts become
[53:53] words and words are seeds
[53:58] that's why when we get a
[54:00] thought we either take ownership of it
[54:03] or we
[54:06] don't okay once again when we get a
[54:10] thought we'll either take ownership or
[54:13] we
[54:14] won't it is said and we've said this few
[54:18] times an idea is like a
[54:22] virus resilient
[54:26] highly
[54:28] contagious and even the smallest seed of
[54:31] an idea can
[54:35] grow it can grow to Define you or
[54:38] destroy
[54:40] you we heard last Sunday that uh that
[54:44] Satan is the father of Lies
[54:47] amen how many know the Bible says that
[54:49] is that
[54:50] right Satan is the F the father of Lies
[54:54] how many once again know that
[54:58] let me see your hands if you
[55:00] know if you don't know it don't raise
[55:02] your
[55:04] hand it's amazing if we know he's the
[55:07] father of
[55:11] Lies it's amazing how easily he gets us
[55:14] to believe
[55:17] him okay once again how many of you know
[55:20] that he's the father of
[55:23] Lies now if he's lying to you
[55:26] somebody's lying to you do you believe
[55:30] them say no right say no of course
[55:34] not but when he comes to you and tells
[55:36] you that you're no
[55:39] good that that you're not going to
[55:41] amount to
[55:42] nothing tells you that you're
[55:44] sick it tells you tells you that you're
[55:47] lesser than someone
[55:49] else it tells you you're not going to
[55:51] make it he tells you all these things
[55:54] and the first thing we do is
[55:59] I guess uh I guess I'm not
[56:03] worthy okay once again how many know
[56:06] he's the father of
[56:08] Lies so why is it so easy to believe the
[56:11] father of
[56:14] Lies than to believe the father of
[56:18] Truth why is that ask your yourself the
[56:22] question it's what we were hearing last
[56:24] Sunday it was so wonderful
[56:28] we take his word even before God's word
[56:30] many
[56:32] times God Says by my stripes you are
[56:37] healed says you're going to
[56:39] die who do we
[56:45] believe Satan says you're not going to
[56:47] make
[56:48] it your past sins are coming to haunt
[56:52] you and God said you already made it
[56:57] just believe
[56:58] me and yet it's so hard to believe
[57:05] that right than than to believe the
[57:08] other and after a while you kind of get
[57:11] tired of
[57:12] it and you're like why am I so easily
[57:16] deceived or or why do I so easily
[57:18] believe these
[57:21] things the Bible says you got to try the
[57:24] spirits right
[57:26] try the thoughts and see if they are of
[57:29] God or
[57:31] not and that's like very hard for us to
[57:35] even do
[57:37] that but I'm coming to something that I
[57:40] want I want to share with
[57:43] you you know as we were hearing this
[57:45] message last
[57:47] night we hear Brother brandham as he
[57:49] goes into the into the creation of
[57:54] squirrels see the the so many different
[57:57] ways that that that the Lord
[58:01] [Music]
[58:03] showed and and even the the the third
[58:06] pool the the five identifications of the
[58:08] third pool and so
[58:11] forth but when he goes into the creation
[58:14] of
[58:15] things my goodness I have heard but now
[58:19] I
[58:20] see you know and that's the thing is why
[58:23] no one can take it away from us
[58:27] no one can tell us anything
[58:29] different because when they say it that
[58:31] was just for brother
[58:34] brandom no brother brandom even
[58:37] said the third pole is to the total
[58:41] loss but it's for the
[58:44] bride now now now think about that how
[58:46] do we put that into
[58:49] action this is where we get
[58:51] stuck because we believe those things
[58:55] it's easy to believe when the enemy
[58:57] comes and says oh no no no that's just
[58:58] for brother
[59:01] brandham that's just for this brother or
[59:04] that
[59:06] sister everything that is written in the
[59:08] scripture is
[59:10] mine so I want you to tell your neighbor
[59:13] this
[59:14] morning everything that is in the
[59:16] scriptures is
[59:18] mine now either you believe that or you
[59:21] don't either you're going to believe
[59:23] that or you're going to believe saying
[59:25] when he's when he tell
[59:30] you but he says all that I have I've
[59:33] given to
[59:35] you but why do we not believe those
[59:38] things
[59:40] today you know after a while you kind of
[59:42] grow a little bit and mature in some
[59:44] things and you're like wait a minute
[59:45] wait a
[59:48] minute that's why I I I want to be real
[59:51] with you this
[59:52] morning a couple of weeks
[59:55] ago I was out
[59:57] jogging know sometimes it doesn't look
[59:59] like one's jogging or
[1:00:03] exercising believe me I was out there
[1:00:05] well I think I'm
[1:00:07] jogging know I kind of go and then I and
[1:00:09] then it's like after a while you know
[1:00:11] just like I'm not going very
[1:00:15] fast but I was out I was out let's just
[1:00:18] put it like that walk
[1:00:21] fast and as I'm walking this thought
[1:00:24] comes
[1:00:27] and here this respon says I I can't
[1:00:29] believe
[1:00:30] it I can't believe
[1:00:33] it no no I can't believe it how in the
[1:00:38] world how could a man like
[1:00:42] Solomon considered to be the wisest man
[1:00:46] on
[1:00:47] Earth had a gift of
[1:00:51] wisdom a gift of
[1:00:53] discernment how could he allow him
[1:00:57] self to have a thousand wives and
[1:01:03] concubines wouldn't he have
[1:01:06] known that if he brought all these
[1:01:08] different women from different parts of
[1:01:10] the
[1:01:12] world wouldn't he have
[1:01:15] known that they were going to come with
[1:01:17] their
[1:01:18] Idols they were going to come with their
[1:01:21] religions they were going to bring them
[1:01:23] into Israel
[1:01:26] and cause many people to to be taken
[1:01:29] away from
[1:01:31] God that it would even pull himself from
[1:01:35] God don't you think that the wisest man
[1:01:38] would have known
[1:01:40] that right I'm I'm just saying I don't
[1:01:44] know about you so I'm I'm I'm telling
[1:01:46] you the thought that
[1:01:48] came we Ponder those
[1:01:52] things and as we Ponder them
[1:01:57] we tend to always view the things in a
[1:01:59] carnal
[1:02:01] way that's our biggest
[1:02:04] problem yes or yes amen everything we
[1:02:07] look at we think it's all
[1:02:10] carnal why did they do that why did she
[1:02:13] do that why why why you're looking at it
[1:02:18] carnally but as I was thinking about
[1:02:22] that I took I took that into captivity
[1:02:27] I took that thought into
[1:02:29] captivity and all of a sudden a voice
[1:02:31] tells
[1:02:33] me it won't make sense if you look at it
[1:02:39] carnally but if you put on your
[1:02:41] spiritual
[1:02:43] eyes you'll know that Solomon's
[1:02:47] life was a type of
[1:02:51] Christ yes or yes oh now it's starting
[1:02:54] to make a little bit better
[1:02:57] sense and I said that's true
[1:02:59] Lord he says and then all of a sudden he
[1:03:02] says can't you
[1:03:03] see have not I taken all each each one
[1:03:08] of
[1:03:09] you my bride I've taken them from
[1:03:12] different parts of the
[1:03:15] world whether whatever religion they
[1:03:17] were
[1:03:19] in whatever Idols they
[1:03:22] had I brought them together to be my
[1:03:27] don't you see it was just a perfect
[1:03:31] type you you began to see things a
[1:03:34] little better
[1:03:36] now things are clear that's why many
[1:03:39] times even in our own
[1:03:42] life why did I do
[1:03:45] that what what why what was I
[1:03:48] thinking but when when it comes down to
[1:03:50] it you realize one
[1:03:53] thing that the footsteps of the
[1:03:55] righteous are are ordered of
[1:03:59] God yes or yes come on tell your
[1:04:02] neighbor the footsteps of the
[1:04:05] righteous no no no no no no no let me
[1:04:08] stop turn to your neighbor
[1:04:10] again say my
[1:04:14] footsteps are ordered of
[1:04:16] God oh now we're getting
[1:04:20] somewhere it's not just the footsteps of
[1:04:22] the righteous oh they're they're
[1:04:24] wonderful great people
[1:04:27] never do anything wrong no no they're
[1:04:30] righteous because of his
[1:04:34] righteousness not because of their own
[1:04:37] righteousness they're not worthy because
[1:04:39] of
[1:04:41] themselves they're worthy because their
[1:04:43] sacrifice is the worthy
[1:04:46] one so tell your other neighbor
[1:04:49] now say my
[1:04:52] footsteps they are ordered or ordained
[1:04:55] of
[1:04:56] God now now do you believe that the
[1:05:00] scripture says that so can the enemy
[1:05:03] tell you ah you're just a
[1:05:06] failure all you have to do is tell him
[1:05:08] no my footsteps are ordered of
[1:05:13] God that's
[1:05:16] why then why is it
[1:05:18] that their lives in the Old
[1:05:22] Testament were part of a great parable
[1:05:27] and we acknowledge it and we understand
[1:05:30] it Solomon perfect
[1:05:35] type do you believe
[1:05:39] that you know Solomon was just a
[1:05:42] man just like
[1:05:48] you I'm making a point here I hope
[1:05:50] you're getting
[1:05:52] it was just a man
[1:06:00] I hope you're getting it this
[1:06:03] morning why is it so easy to believe
[1:06:07] Solomon even after all the things that
[1:06:09] were
[1:06:11] done carnally there's a lot of things
[1:06:14] that are
[1:06:16] wo yeah read read all that he wrote
[1:06:19] he'll tell you things he went through
[1:06:23] why he chose this and this and
[1:06:26] and it's easy to believe those
[1:06:29] people why do we believe
[1:06:32] them because the Bible said
[1:06:35] so right so it makes it easier right
[1:06:39] they're in the Bible so are
[1:06:42] you hello everybody come on now tell
[1:06:45] your neighbor so are
[1:06:47] you so are you I find myself all over
[1:06:51] the
[1:06:53] Bible Well it doesn't say your
[1:06:56] name yeah it does it says Caleb and
[1:07:00] Joshua don't look at it
[1:07:02] carnally look at it
[1:07:04] spiritually we're all calebs is that
[1:07:07] right think about this though through
[1:07:10] their ups and
[1:07:12] downs they typed
[1:07:15] Christ yet we have a hard time
[1:07:19] believing that we are part of this great
[1:07:22] parable
[1:07:26] it's easy to believe the minister or the
[1:07:32] pastor another news flash the pastor is
[1:07:35] is just a Man
[1:07:43] Too Well same seems like I burst your
[1:07:45] bubble or
[1:07:48] what the pastor just a m he is oh
[1:07:54] man come on
[1:07:56] a man just like
[1:07:58] you yes I've been given something to
[1:08:00] help God's people a GI yes
[1:08:03] ab and we don't take that for
[1:08:06] granted but understand there are
[1:08:08] struggles every day young people
[1:08:11] understand this you're not by
[1:08:13] yourself we struggle we Minister
[1:08:16] struggle just like
[1:08:17] you we thoughts we get we get thoughts
[1:08:20] that come to
[1:08:21] us we got to fight them off just like
[1:08:24] you
[1:08:26] we get Spirit of anxiety attacking
[1:08:30] us but we got to fight them off just
[1:08:32] like
[1:08:34] you are you with me I want you to
[1:08:38] understand this what God thinks about
[1:08:44] you that's right this message is to tell
[1:08:48] you the things that he tells
[1:08:51] me like I said I'm be real with you
[1:08:55] as brother Bram says oh he just began to
[1:08:58] talk to my
[1:09:01] conscience he talks to my conscience
[1:09:03] more than anyone
[1:09:05] else anybody else
[1:09:16] here so I leave for my
[1:09:23] trip thank the Lord for this time he
[1:09:25] gave
[1:09:28] me and I'm on the
[1:09:31] road and you think oh relax when
[1:09:40] hunting he don't care he don't take
[1:09:44] vacations so I'm driving we're driving
[1:09:47] there and here he comes
[1:09:51] again because I was thinking now this
[1:09:53] was not the enemy this was me
[1:09:58] so you know some of the things that
[1:09:59] brother Caleb thinks
[1:10:02] about can I share it with you all right
[1:10:05] driving down the
[1:10:06] road and I began to think of all the new
[1:10:09] people that that have comeing coming
[1:10:14] in my goodness amen amen and I and I
[1:10:18] began to think more and more I was
[1:10:20] like the time is rapidly fle
[1:10:26] and then I began to think of the Pastors
[1:10:28] in Uganda
[1:10:31] and the people
[1:10:34] there Lord will will they get
[1:10:38] it they're getting
[1:10:42] it I began to see the the body of Christ
[1:10:45] coming together in different
[1:10:48] parts different
[1:10:51] countries parts and you just see this
[1:10:53] one connecting with that and the body
[1:10:56] somehow some
[1:11:00] way what man could not do God is
[1:11:05] doing but he's doing it through
[1:11:09] man and and I'm thinking about this and
[1:11:11] then I and then I start to think about
[1:11:13] Lord the people that have been in for
[1:11:15] many
[1:11:17] years can't seem to overcome and they
[1:11:20] they struggle with the same things over
[1:11:22] and over
[1:11:26] that's my mind
[1:11:29] going and then the enemy comes to my
[1:11:33] conscience and this is what he tells
[1:11:36] me you're going to run
[1:11:41] out about the back of my hair on the
[1:11:44] back of my neck standing
[1:11:47] up and then he tells me
[1:11:49] again you're going to run out of
[1:11:52] time there's not enough time now you
[1:11:56] that are new don't you get
[1:12:00] scared don't get
[1:12:02] scared but I'm thinking this and and the
[1:12:04] enemy comes to tell me
[1:12:07] this I can either take ownership of that
[1:12:12] thought or I can reject the
[1:12:15] thought I have a decision I have a
[1:12:17] choice that I can
[1:12:18] make you see when you hear a voice or or
[1:12:22] receive a thought
[1:12:25] shows that there's a channel
[1:12:29] open are you with me come on now there's
[1:12:32] a channel he's trying to get
[1:12:35] in and so he he's he's doing different
[1:12:38] things to try to to try to get
[1:12:41] in now now now this is through the
[1:12:43] message and we heard this but I'm gonna
[1:12:44] I'm going to quote what brother brandham
[1:12:47] says when you know you've done exactly
[1:12:50] what God told you to
[1:12:53] do then wait wa for that channel of
[1:12:56] inspiration to open up to
[1:13:01] you I want to know how many of you have
[1:13:04] have waited on
[1:13:07] God it's not just waiting on
[1:13:10] him it says when you've done exactly
[1:13:14] what God told you to
[1:13:16] do how many of you believe that God God
[1:13:19] can speak to you through the
[1:13:22] pastor and then and then things don't go
[1:13:24] right
[1:13:26] well I'm waiting on
[1:13:28] God when you've done exactly what the
[1:13:30] Lord told
[1:13:33] you then he says wait for the channel of
[1:13:36] inspiration to open
[1:13:40] up see he says we've got to have
[1:13:44] confidence I want this to the honor and
[1:13:48] glory of
[1:13:50] God everything we
[1:13:52] do should be for the honor and glory of
[1:13:56] God get to something good here in a
[1:14:00] moment you see faith has a channel to
[1:14:04] move
[1:14:07] into if it
[1:14:09] doesn't then you you've got mental
[1:14:13] intellectual
[1:14:15] faith and not genuine Faith from
[1:14:19] God this is one scripture brother Ram
[1:14:22] says that stumped me
[1:14:33] there you go yeah it STP me exactly a
[1:14:35] good one this is one scripture that
[1:14:38] stumped
[1:14:40] me not if I say this is the Lord telling
[1:14:45] him but if you
[1:14:48] say not if Jesus said
[1:14:53] it but if you say it of
[1:14:59] yourself okay okay how many believe this
[1:15:02] the prophet of
[1:15:04] God once again not if Jesus said
[1:15:07] it but if you said it of
[1:15:11] yourself oh that's what we
[1:15:14] want he says I thought and somehow I
[1:15:18] broke into that
[1:15:22] channel how many of you have ever been
[1:15:24] in that channel
[1:15:31] I thought we were
[1:15:32] Christians thought we were
[1:15:34] Believers you never broke into that
[1:15:37] channel oh my goodness you need to come
[1:15:40] talk to me see
[1:15:42] me and I thought somehow I broke into
[1:15:45] that
[1:15:47] channel and then he goes on and says old
[1:15:49] little H is sitting back
[1:15:51] there talking about the
[1:15:53] squirrels that brother brandom that's
[1:15:55] nothing but the
[1:15:58] truth she said the right
[1:16:01] thing and when she said that the Holy
[1:16:05] Spirit dropped over in that channel
[1:16:09] again and every one of them felt
[1:16:13] it I raised up and I said sister H thus
[1:16:17] sayth the
[1:16:19] Lord you said the right
[1:16:22] word like the serapan said
[1:16:27] and then he says now notice job needed a
[1:16:29] Channel of
[1:16:32] inspiration and he had it
[1:16:36] open he had a channel to communicate
[1:16:39] with
[1:16:40] God by his
[1:16:43] inspiration he had a way of moving
[1:16:46] himself
[1:16:48] out and let the word of God move
[1:16:51] in so if you've never been in that
[1:16:54] channel
[1:16:56] it's because you've never learned how to
[1:16:58] get yourself
[1:17:00] out so that he can come
[1:17:03] in all right but we got it yeah all
[1:17:08] right you see the reason that the
[1:17:10] channel of inspiration doesn't open to
[1:17:15] many because we don't know how to
[1:17:19] relax yes or yes I'm going to keep you
[1:17:23] awake today
[1:17:27] yeah tell your neighbor stay awake
[1:17:30] neighbor all right yeah we got to stay
[1:17:32] awake because we've got to get this okay
[1:17:34] this is
[1:17:38] important we can't
[1:17:41] relax because our pride gets in the
[1:17:48] way oh you're going to you're going to
[1:17:50] know what I'm talking about in a
[1:17:52] moment once again you can't
[1:17:56] relax because our pride gets in the
[1:18:00] way and then he goes on that's what all
[1:18:03] Divine gifts
[1:18:06] are to serve God's people
[1:18:10] with everybody's not ordered to be a
[1:18:15] prophet yes or
[1:18:18] yes all of you is not ordered to praying
[1:18:21] for the
[1:18:23] sick all of is not ordered to be pastors
[1:18:26] and so
[1:18:28] forth but it's a
[1:18:30] channel that God has open to
[1:18:34] them and as he we had this morning in
[1:18:37] the
[1:18:39] lesson one man has no
[1:18:43] business deviating in the next man's
[1:18:50] Channel tell your neighbor you got to
[1:18:52] tell your neighbor that s you going to
[1:18:53] help me Preach Today
[1:18:56] one man has no right to get into another
[1:19:01] man's
[1:19:03] Channel no matter how inspired you
[1:19:09] are I like that one think about it how
[1:19:14] many here are
[1:19:18] saved good I like that good praise
[1:19:21] God that was a channel that was revealed
[1:19:24] to you
[1:19:26] brother says that's the channel That was
[1:19:32] revealed how many of you need
[1:19:34] healing you see your hands if you need
[1:19:36] healing of
[1:19:38] something brother Ram says
[1:19:40] this it's the same
[1:19:47] channel
[1:19:49] on wait a minute we don't have to go to
[1:19:52] a through another channel to get healed
[1:19:57] how many people saved do we
[1:20:01] have you sure can anyone tell you you're
[1:20:04] not
[1:20:06] saved that's how sure you have to be for
[1:20:08] your for your
[1:20:10] healing brother says it's the same
[1:20:14] channel
[1:20:16] Hallelujah that's the same
[1:20:19] channel that through divine
[1:20:22] revelation tells you that you're
[1:20:27] healed the problem is is that the
[1:20:29] channel gets clogged
[1:20:33] sometimes and sometimes we got to just
[1:20:35] blow the channel out and get the junk
[1:20:39] out now don't
[1:20:41] forget but the devil had told me okay CU
[1:20:43] it all goes together in the
[1:20:46] message you're going to run out of
[1:20:50] time I had that one working in back of
[1:20:52] my
[1:20:54] now now now during the
[1:20:58] hunt during the
[1:21:01] huh now how many Hunters we have
[1:21:06] here a lot of hunters hunters and
[1:21:11] Hunters how many good
[1:21:17] Hunters brother Isaac I can't I can't I
[1:21:20] can't raise my hand on that one I'm just
[1:21:22] a hunter by the help of God
[1:21:26] I I I need I mean sometimes I'm out
[1:21:29] there think Lord I need divine
[1:21:32] intervention but I enjoy
[1:21:36] it but I hear that again you're going to
[1:21:38] run out of
[1:21:41] time now when the hunt started my
[1:21:45] hunt me me sharing with
[1:21:48] you as the hunt started I I had many
[1:21:52] opportunities but I had already told
[1:21:54] them the the the men that were out
[1:21:57] there I said as if I see it's got to be
[1:22:00] bigger than the last one I
[1:22:05] killed now in one sense that would be
[1:22:10] like acting like a spoiled
[1:22:14] brat no no no
[1:22:18] no everything this is what I'm getting
[1:22:23] at do you you ever look at your life
[1:22:25] really as a
[1:22:29] parable if what the prophets of old and
[1:22:32] the people in the Old Testament they
[1:22:37] type what should the reality of it
[1:22:40] be we are the parable
[1:22:43] church then everything we do in our
[1:22:45] lives should
[1:22:48] matter we're we're not just we're not
[1:22:50] just Christians at
[1:22:53] church we got we got to be the same
[1:22:56] Christian out
[1:22:58] there whether we're at work or whether
[1:23:00] we're at
[1:23:01] school or whether we're
[1:23:04] hunting that's how he showed to the
[1:23:06] prophet the third
[1:23:09] pool you want the
[1:23:12] squirrel come on is that just for
[1:23:15] him but it opened up for
[1:23:18] us to show that Jesus Christ is the same
[1:23:24] yesterday today
[1:23:26] forever it wasn't brother Bram that was
[1:23:28] doing
[1:23:30] it there was something from
[1:23:33] eternity that had been deposited in that
[1:23:37] man that allowed him to
[1:23:40] speak and to bring things into
[1:23:44] existence okay now forgive me if I get
[1:23:47] excited but watch this
[1:23:48] now I had decided
[1:23:51] that you ask them it comes to Hunted I'm
[1:23:54] at least
[1:23:57] disciplined say no names I don't want to
[1:24:00] say no
[1:24:01] names but I know there's there's quite a
[1:24:05] few they purpose nope I'm holding out
[1:24:07] for the big
[1:24:10] one and as soon as something
[1:24:15] moves boom and
[1:24:17] like you really held out that
[1:24:21] one but at least I can say
[1:24:26] I'm disciplined when it comes to
[1:24:28] that and I said I'm going to wait till
[1:24:30] the last
[1:24:33] evening now all this there's there's
[1:24:35] there's a relevance to all this I'm
[1:24:39] gonna wait till the last
[1:24:41] evening I'm gonna was GNA hunt and I
[1:24:44] walked away I don't even know how
[1:24:47] many he sent ones nice
[1:24:51] ones nope I don't want that one
[1:24:55] I walked
[1:24:57] away come on that was
[1:25:01] nice for you not for
[1:25:04] me no I walked
[1:25:06] away and I decided that at the last
[1:25:09] moment because I had either sex
[1:25:12] uh my
[1:25:16] license I said at the last moment what
[1:25:18] the Lord puts in my
[1:25:22] path just so I can take home some meat
[1:25:26] that's a good plan
[1:25:27] right
[1:25:29] well during the
[1:25:32] hunt brother Omar was telling me a
[1:25:35] story about a young man who was out
[1:25:37] hunting and he did not he couldn't see
[1:25:40] he didn't see any
[1:25:44] animals and an old man that was there
[1:25:47] with
[1:25:48] him he told him simply
[1:25:51] this just relax
[1:25:55] it seems like insignificant
[1:25:59] relax he said so I did what he told
[1:26:03] me I just
[1:26:05] relaxed and the moment I did I started
[1:26:08] seeing him
[1:26:10] everywhere do that hunt you know after a
[1:26:12] while your eyes get
[1:26:16] tired you see everything moving oh
[1:26:18] there's one oh no
[1:26:19] it's after a while it just it's tiring
[1:26:25] so that became our model for the
[1:26:29] whole we won't see nothing and we and
[1:26:31] then we look at each other say
[1:26:34] relax brother Omar asked brother Omar
[1:26:36] and brother Ben if it's not
[1:26:38] true we say that and we would relax boom
[1:26:41] there they are boom there they are we
[1:26:44] would't see it for a little while just
[1:26:47] relax there's a point to all this too
[1:26:50] I'm not telling you a hunting
[1:26:52] story brother Bron wasn't just telling
[1:26:54] us hunting
[1:26:55] stor St no there was something behind
[1:26:59] what he was
[1:27:00] saying and if you're caral you're just
[1:27:02] going to see a
[1:27:04] hunt but if you're spiritual you're
[1:27:06] going to catch the spiritual
[1:27:09] application so we'd say just
[1:27:12] relax yeah it was just
[1:27:16] relaxed until it was the sun had gone
[1:27:19] down you know there's about 30 minutes
[1:27:22] left of of light before it's
[1:27:27] dark and then all of a sudden just relax
[1:27:33] huh do you start
[1:27:35] thinking well I have to go home and tell
[1:27:38] my wife what kind of story am
[1:27:41] I I wasn't always I didn't always shoot
[1:27:46] animals when I'd come home empty handed
[1:27:48] she say what's the story
[1:27:50] this don't be laughing at me
[1:27:54] that's my
[1:27:55] story he said he said that's his story
[1:27:59] too but but but through it
[1:28:03] all it's 30 minutes left before before
[1:28:06] it's
[1:28:08] dark 19 yeah two
[1:28:13] outs we count we're we're we're at the
[1:28:16] last moment
[1:28:18] now and about that time they see some in
[1:28:22] another Canyon
[1:28:24] you going to take him nope no I said I'm
[1:28:28] not going to go all the way down the
[1:28:29] canyon and go up the other Canyon for a
[1:28:31] little one like
[1:28:34] that so I get back in the side by
[1:28:38] side they looking at it 20 minutes now
[1:28:42] till dark last day of the
[1:28:45] hunt when all of a sudden the voice
[1:28:47] comes
[1:28:49] again you're going to run out of
[1:28:52] time you understand this is the same
[1:28:54] voice that told me before the
[1:28:57] hunt when I was thinking about you all
[1:29:00] when I was thinking about our Breen
[1:29:01] around the world you're going to run out
[1:29:04] of
[1:29:05] time and the voice comes one more time
[1:29:07] and says you're going to run out of
[1:29:09] time the light's gone you're going to
[1:29:12] run out of time the first thing I did I
[1:29:15] had to reject that
[1:29:18] voice I take ownership of
[1:29:21] it and the moment that I rejected that
[1:29:23] voice
[1:29:25] a channel opened up and a voice then
[1:29:28] tells me now you can believe me or not
[1:29:31] that's
[1:29:33] okay but I stand before you
[1:29:36] here before the Lord and the voice said
[1:29:40] this he says do you believe your own
[1:29:43] word and I said yes sir he said then
[1:29:47] speak
[1:29:48] it this is 20 minutes before it gets
[1:29:53] dark I said in the name of
[1:29:55] Jesus I said Lord I'm going to see one
[1:29:58] before it gets
[1:30:00] started I'm shoot it Lord but I do need
[1:30:04] your help can you please guide the
[1:30:07] bullet I did you not the GU got
[1:30:10] in it wasn't even five minutes down the
[1:30:14] road when there was an elk all by itself
[1:30:17] where it came from only God
[1:30:20] knows but there was there was an ALK by
[1:30:23] itself
[1:30:26] wow I got out so fast got out on the
[1:30:30] knee one shot and I turned around what
[1:30:33] did I say brother
[1:30:38] Omar
[1:30:41] there dropped him and I turned around I
[1:30:43] said how do you like
[1:30:45] that now I wasn't telling that to the
[1:30:49] brothers I was saying that to the
[1:30:52] spirit that told me we're going to run
[1:30:54] out of time and I said how do you like
[1:30:59] that I'm going to say it again Church
[1:31:02] how do you like
[1:31:03] that it wasn't so much about the
[1:31:07] elk it was that God is always
[1:31:11] faithful and when he says that we will
[1:31:14] make
[1:31:15] it I don't care how much light is
[1:31:19] left because what he has
[1:31:22] promised will fulfill that because the
[1:31:26] the footsteps of the righteous are
[1:31:28] already ordered of
[1:31:31] God you can believe me or
[1:31:34] not but I'm going to tell you once
[1:31:37] again just
[1:31:39] relax when the channel was
[1:31:41] open it was a to Total
[1:31:48] relaxation now let me explain this to
[1:31:51] you because it's not about sitting at
[1:31:55] home with your feet up watching
[1:31:59] television having some
[1:32:02] lemonade and said I'm
[1:32:04] relaxing no that's a carnal
[1:32:08] relaxation I'm talking about spiritual
[1:32:14] relaxation the whole world can be
[1:32:16] falling
[1:32:18] apart but in our
[1:32:20] soul should be a total perfect
[1:32:22] relaxation
[1:32:26] brother Bram says the Christian walk is
[1:32:29] based upon
[1:32:33] rest and when I'm resting in
[1:32:36] him I'm not worried about what I can or
[1:32:39] can't
[1:32:41] do I already know what he already
[1:32:46] did come on now are you with me I'm
[1:32:49] trying to bring you up to Higher Ground
[1:32:57] yeah I want to I want to go higher
[1:33:01] ground am when I see
[1:33:04] this I see what God is
[1:33:08] doing that wasn't for
[1:33:10] me I already
[1:33:15] believe I said he's never
[1:33:17] late he's always on
[1:33:20] time we're not going to run out of time
[1:33:24] come on all you young new people that
[1:33:28] had just come
[1:33:30] in you're not going to run
[1:33:38] out oh come on now you really believe
[1:33:43] that why why do you say that
[1:33:47] brother and understand I want you to get
[1:33:50] and understand this
[1:33:53] the seventh seal is the coming of
[1:33:57] Christ yes or yes the seventh seal is
[1:34:01] the end of all
[1:34:02] things it's the end of struggling
[1:34:07] nature it's the end of
[1:34:11] time that's why we can't run
[1:34:15] out how many are with
[1:34:18] me we can't run out of time because the
[1:34:22] moment you accepted
[1:34:24] him it brings you to a New
[1:34:27] Birth you are no longer a creature of
[1:34:30] time you're a creature of
[1:34:33] Eternity so how can you run out of
[1:34:36] time if you're
[1:34:38] Eternal I'm not talking about this guy
[1:34:41] I'm talking about the one that lives
[1:34:44] inside oh I love
[1:34:47] that it's the coming of
[1:34:49] Christ and my question is who is he
[1:34:52] coming to
[1:34:55] oh we're waiting for the coming of
[1:34:58] Christ clouds to open and him come
[1:35:01] through you got a denominational
[1:35:07] idea me stop for a
[1:35:10] moment because I've said this
[1:35:13] before it's just as bad to sing a lie as
[1:35:16] it is to say a lie
[1:35:28] amen right amen it's just as
[1:35:33] bad I surrender all you're not
[1:35:36] surrendered you're
[1:35:42] lying watch what you
[1:35:45] sing it would be best not to sing than
[1:35:48] to sing
[1:35:54] that's right amen All to Jesus I
[1:36:01] Surrender and then we leave and we're
[1:36:03] cussing up a storm and have one foot in
[1:36:05] the world and
[1:36:07] one and we're thinking and seeing things
[1:36:09] we
[1:36:20] shouldn't wow oh gosh help us Lord have
[1:36:24] mercy on
[1:36:27] us I'm just letting that one sink good
[1:36:30] that one that one hit
[1:36:34] good your neighbor say we're getting
[1:36:37] through it
[1:36:39] neighbor it
[1:36:47] is it don't be looking at me funny at me
[1:36:53] you see the looks you guys give me
[1:36:58] some humor me humor
[1:37:02] me I'm I'm not trying to be fun I'm
[1:37:04] telling you that's what I
[1:37:09] get this is like heaven to me I don't
[1:37:11] know why everything's going
[1:37:18] wrong when we all get to heaven oh I
[1:37:22] can't wait and
[1:37:25] you understand the denominational ideas
[1:37:27] of
[1:37:30] heaven we were not made to go live off
[1:37:33] where the angels
[1:37:35] are the ones that have passed on are
[1:37:38] dying that's not the word to use dying
[1:37:41] they're an expectation of coming back to
[1:37:47] earth oh we're going to go to heaven one
[1:37:49] of these
[1:37:50] days what's your mentality about this
[1:37:53] that we're going to go live off in a
[1:37:55] somewhere out
[1:37:56] there come on think about
[1:37:58] it we are we are Sons we were made to
[1:38:01] inhabit the
[1:38:05] Earth hallu but it's time that heaven
[1:38:09] and Earth come
[1:38:12] together this is like heaven to
[1:38:15] me and we're in the word and we're we're
[1:38:18] connected to the
[1:38:21] channel this is like heaven to me
[1:38:25] come up higher we're in a different
[1:38:28] dimension but we're here on Earth
[1:38:31] they're longing to come
[1:38:36] back come on now I could get on that for
[1:38:39] a while but that's not where I'm
[1:38:42] going relax means you're resting in
[1:38:46] Christ do you see why there's so much
[1:38:49] contention in US
[1:38:55] come on now the the fight that's going
[1:38:57] on is not we're always looking out there
[1:38:59] it's in
[1:39:01] here you know what it is our contention
[1:39:05] is our
[1:39:07] pride pride brings
[1:39:10] contention your neighbor neighbor Pride
[1:39:13] brings contention
[1:39:23] when we see
[1:39:25] this brother Bram says about the SE in
[1:39:28] the seventh
[1:39:30] seal seven straight thunders in a
[1:39:33] row heaven couldn't write them Heavens
[1:39:37] can't know it there's nothing to go on
[1:39:40] and then says it was a
[1:39:45] relax what a
[1:39:47] key I'm going to say it again what a
[1:39:50] key nothing to go on
[1:39:54] it's a relaxing time you know why we
[1:39:57] won't
[1:39:58] move until the
[1:40:01] channel until the channel of inspiration
[1:40:03] is opened
[1:40:05] up where do you want to go
[1:40:08] hunting I don't know let's try here good
[1:40:10] as any other place anybody have
[1:40:12] ideas but when it's
[1:40:14] him then we can act upon
[1:40:18] [Music]
[1:40:20] that he said it was relaxing time
[1:40:23] so great that it was kept from the
[1:40:26] Angels that's why brother Brandon would
[1:40:29] say when I
[1:40:31] relax I get myself out of the
[1:40:35] way and that's when the gift
[1:40:41] works so just
[1:40:44] relax I don't know what I'm gonna
[1:40:46] do let the channel open up and you know
[1:40:49] exactly what to do
[1:40:55] no I'm looking at it people are looking
[1:40:58] yeah I got a lot of problems get
[1:41:02] yourself out of the
[1:41:03] way because you're the reason that you
[1:41:05] have a lot of
[1:41:07] problems because you've tried to do it
[1:41:09] all your
[1:41:10] own and San Cuts you off every
[1:41:13] time but it's time not to let Satan cut
[1:41:16] you
[1:41:19] off and know that I am
[1:41:21] God then panel opens after we've moved
[1:41:25] oursel out of the
[1:41:27] way then he comes and then the thing is
[1:41:30] taken care
[1:41:32] of do you understand how our
[1:41:36] pride keeps the channel from opening to
[1:41:40] us everybody understand that I'm trying
[1:41:42] to make it as simple as possible
[1:41:46] here that's what it's all
[1:41:49] about letting him bring
[1:41:53] the answer in your
[1:41:55] life watch he says it's just a relaxing
[1:41:59] time get yourself out of the
[1:42:02] way that's what relaxing is all
[1:42:06] about not not doing
[1:42:10] nothing we don't relax because there's
[1:42:12] too much contention inside of
[1:42:16] us Proverbs 1310 what causes
[1:42:21] contention again yes only by Pride
[1:42:26] cometh
[1:42:30] content I want every one of you today
[1:42:32] and I include
[1:42:34] myself to search yourself your
[1:42:39] heart there is not one
[1:42:42] person that I've ever heard that
[1:42:45] says I got a bad Spirit
[1:42:50] upright nobody recognizes is that they
[1:42:53] have
[1:42:56] pride pride only by Pride cometh
[1:43:05] contention AER says
[1:43:09] this what what comes in our minds when
[1:43:12] we think of
[1:43:15] God is the most important thing about
[1:43:21] us we as humans
[1:43:24] we have a very hard time to bring
[1:43:26] balance in our
[1:43:28] lives try not to try not to go too long
[1:43:33] today we try to have a very hard time
[1:43:36] bringing the
[1:43:38] balance because we either think that we
[1:43:41] we either think more of ourselves or
[1:43:43] less of
[1:43:47] ourselves when you're on top of the
[1:43:49] world making some
[1:43:51] cash got some good things going
[1:43:54] on yeah we got it going
[1:43:57] on but when things are go
[1:44:00] dry no money coming in
[1:44:03] struggling then we think less of
[1:44:06] ourselves what does that show Pride you
[1:44:10] know why because we won't ask for
[1:44:12] help we won't even ask God for
[1:44:16] help I already went to him too
[1:44:19] much I prayed and he didn't answer me
[1:44:23] you're getting into some pretty
[1:44:24] Dangerous
[1:44:27] Ground this is why the hardest thing for
[1:44:30] God to
[1:44:32] do is to get one mortal to believe
[1:44:35] another
[1:44:38] mortal yes the hardest thing for
[1:44:42] God one mortal believes another
[1:44:45] mortal and then the Holy Spirit tells me
[1:44:48] and that's only half of
[1:44:50] it I'm like wait wait wait w who whoa I
[1:44:54] got to check this out is
[1:44:57] this that's only half of it one mortal
[1:45:00] to believe
[1:45:01] another and he says yes he says because
[1:45:05] first you recognize you are
[1:45:08] Immortal and you have to believe
[1:45:12] yourself you have to believe
[1:45:15] yourself if I don't believe that I'm a
[1:45:17] Son of God even though I'm
[1:45:19] Immortal even though I'm immortal
[1:45:23] but in me when Christ comes to
[1:45:27] dwell I am
[1:45:30] Immortal a lot of people ain't going to
[1:45:32] swallow that
[1:45:35] one you believe him you accept him then
[1:45:39] you cannot
[1:45:40] die that makes you
[1:45:43] immortal not this guy but the one that
[1:45:46] lives in here so he says it's hard for
[1:45:49] one mortal to believe another
[1:45:53] but I can never expect another mortal to
[1:45:55] believe
[1:45:57] me if I don't believe
[1:46:01] myself if I don't believe who I
[1:46:04] am God placed me as a
[1:46:08] pastor believe that and act like
[1:46:11] that I expect anyone else to
[1:46:14] believe how many are with me notice this
[1:46:18] is good can I have just a few more
[1:46:19] minutes
[1:46:24] I'm gonna have to like go
[1:46:26] gy speak some of my message in a
[1:46:30] prayer he's good at that he's good at
[1:46:33] that that's right that's right those are
[1:46:36] tricks of the
[1:46:39] trade notice
[1:46:41] this
[1:46:44] Glory the mistake is that pride gets in
[1:46:47] the
[1:46:49] way how many have have heard the same
[1:46:53] Pride goeth before the
[1:46:56] fall oh
[1:47:00] true Verse
[1:47:02] 18 and it says Pride goeth Before
[1:47:05] Destruction and an hotty spirit before a
[1:47:11] fall Pride or self-conceit is the
[1:47:14] opposite of
[1:47:20] humility let me say that again
[1:47:25] Pride with
[1:47:29] s got that it's the opposite of
[1:47:35] humility the first step to
[1:47:38] humility is to realize that I am proud
[1:47:43] I've got
[1:47:46] pride and most people won't won't do
[1:47:50] that because they don't have no problem
[1:47:52] with being PR
[1:47:55] right
[1:47:57] right uh oh see when everything gets
[1:48:01] quiet then it's
[1:48:07] like
[1:48:09] starts the message starts to
[1:48:13] get the story brings your attention to
[1:48:16] hear the message
[1:48:20] now yet you never hear someone say I
[1:48:23] have a spirit of
[1:48:27] Pride listen to some of these quotes
[1:48:29] that by CS
[1:48:33] Lewis pride is one of those things that
[1:48:35] we
[1:48:38] detest we hate it when we see it in
[1:48:42] someone
[1:48:45] else okay this this is the message now
[1:48:48] okay we're coming to it we hate Pride
[1:48:51] when it's somebody
[1:48:55] they think they're all
[1:48:57] that we hate it huh but when somebody
[1:49:01] saying oh you are the great
[1:49:05] hunter it's okay
[1:49:09] huh oh you're so
[1:49:13] beautiful yeah yeah I
[1:49:15] know right but if they tell that to
[1:49:18] someone else she's not that
[1:49:21] pretty he's not that
[1:49:25] handsome understand this
[1:49:28] church you'll never admit that we are
[1:49:30] ever guilty
[1:49:34] ourselves because the more Pride you
[1:49:37] have the more we dislike pride in
[1:49:44] others why is it because each person's
[1:49:50] pride is in competition with someone
[1:49:53] else's
[1:49:59] Pride I'm going to say it again that's
[1:50:02] why there's
[1:50:04] contention in a
[1:50:06] family home in a church at school at
[1:50:11] work why is there the
[1:50:13] contention because Prides are coming
[1:50:17] together and fighting each other
[1:50:22] when we want to be the center of the
[1:50:25] party and everybody's looking at someone
[1:50:29] else
[1:50:32] clown yeah but when we're making jokes
[1:50:35] and acting
[1:50:39] funny and oh yeah they're they're
[1:50:41] looking at
[1:50:42] me
[1:50:44] Pride come on now get your spiritual
[1:50:47] thinking on here I don't want you just
[1:50:49] to see this carnally I want you I'm
[1:50:51] trying to make it simple so so that you
[1:50:52] can get it in your
[1:50:58] spiritual we want to be the
[1:51:01] center pride is competitive by
[1:51:08] Nature people are not proud to be rich
[1:51:11] smart or
[1:51:15] successful they're not proud to be
[1:51:19] good-looking they're proud of being
[1:51:21] richer
[1:51:23] and smarter and better looking than
[1:51:29] others come on now it's not about yeah
[1:51:32] well I'm this no it's about that I'm
[1:51:34] more than someone
[1:51:38] else cometh before the
[1:51:42] fall greed will make a man want
[1:51:45] money greed greed somebody help
[1:51:50] usia will make a man want money
[1:51:54] for the sake of a better house a better
[1:51:56] car better
[1:51:59] food but it's
[1:52:01] Pride that makes a millionaire want to
[1:52:03] be a
[1:52:06] billionaire billionaire to be a
[1:52:09] trillionaire just to be richer than the
[1:52:14] next
[1:52:18] unchastity
[1:52:19] anger greed drunk
[1:52:29] drunkenness is merely a flea bite in
[1:52:31] comparison
[1:52:36] Pride it was through Pride that the
[1:52:38] devil became the
[1:52:43] devil yes or yes come on Church come on
[1:52:45] now you you're going to have to preach
[1:52:47] with me
[1:52:49] now the devil became the devil because
[1:52:51] of pride
[1:52:54] and pride leads to every other
[1:52:58] Vice Pride never lets you get the help
[1:53:01] that you
[1:53:03] need you're too proud to ask for help no
[1:53:07] but when we realize I need
[1:53:10] help I need divine
[1:53:13] intervention God's
[1:53:16] help now we're realizing recognizing
[1:53:20] pride in our Liv
[1:53:24] it never lets you get the
[1:53:27] help Pride listen closely write this one
[1:53:31] down pride is the complete anti-god
[1:53:35] State of
[1:53:38] Mind pride is the
[1:53:43] complete anti- good state of
[1:53:48] mind that's right why because because
[1:53:52] you want to prove that you can do it on
[1:53:54] your
[1:54:00] own am I is that a yes or a
[1:54:04] yes anti- God State of Mind is
[1:54:09] pride it never will permit you to get
[1:54:13] help I don't need help I can stop on my
[1:54:16] own we can't by Nature we
[1:54:20] can we need help we need God on the
[1:54:25] scene we need him to come on the
[1:54:28] scene we need divine
[1:54:31] intervention we can't do these things
[1:54:33] under on our
[1:54:36] own power is what Pride really
[1:54:41] enjoys nothing makes a man or a person
[1:54:44] feel Superior in
[1:54:47] power as to tell others what to do
[1:54:53] amen I don't care if it's at
[1:54:56] church if it's at work I don't care
[1:54:59] where it's at Pride causes the one to
[1:55:02] puff
[1:55:03] up you do what I tell you or
[1:55:08] else pride is the chief cause of
[1:55:13] misery Pride always brings
[1:55:18] enmity it is not only enmity between man
[1:55:21] and man
[1:55:23] but Pride brings enmity between you and
[1:55:29] God
[1:55:31] why because in God you come up against
[1:55:37] someone which is in every
[1:55:40] aspect immeasurably Superior to
[1:55:49] yourself I could stop right there and
[1:55:55] you finally come upon someone yes with
[1:56:02] so pride and unless you know God has
[1:56:06] been Superior in every
[1:56:10] way know yourself as nothing in
[1:56:15] comparison it means that you don't even
[1:56:17] know God at
[1:56:20] all that you'd have to knowledge that he
[1:56:23] is so much
[1:56:25] greater and as long as you're
[1:56:29] proud you cannot know God
[1:56:32] Church impossible to know
[1:56:37] him a proud man is always looking down
[1:56:40] on
[1:56:43] someone but while he's looking
[1:56:46] down you cannot see what's above you
[1:56:52] our pride does that to
[1:56:55] us and the real test of being in the
[1:56:57] presence of
[1:57:00] God we're in
[1:57:02] church how many like coming to
[1:57:05] church I like coming to
[1:57:08] church are you in the presence of God
[1:57:10] every
[1:57:12] time you can be in church and not be in
[1:57:14] the
[1:57:16] presence somebody is in Heavenly places
[1:57:18] and you're
[1:57:20] not but the real test of being in the
[1:57:23] presence of
[1:57:26] God is that you forget about
[1:57:34] yourself I like that one that's how you
[1:57:37] know you've been in this
[1:57:39] presence you're not thinking about me me
[1:57:43] me this I'm going through that when
[1:57:45] you're in his
[1:57:47] presence none of that
[1:57:49] matters he is the answer
[1:57:54] hello everybody you want me to stop I'll
[1:57:59] stop pride is spiritual
[1:58:06] cancer it eats up the very possibility
[1:58:10] of love and
[1:58:14] contentment pride is a death
[1:58:18] trap we test it by when whenever we find
[1:58:22] that our religious life is making us
[1:58:25] feel
[1:58:29] good and that we are better than someone
[1:58:33] else oh come on did I just go there when
[1:58:37] we feel so
[1:58:39] religious began to feel better than
[1:58:41] someone
[1:58:43] else you can surely
[1:58:45] know that you're not being acted on by
[1:58:48] God but by the devil
[1:58:52] that's my prayer
[1:58:54] today that God take every bit of Pride
[1:58:57] out of
[1:58:58] us wash me this morning Lord how many
[1:59:02] can say that this morning cleanse me
[1:59:04] from Pride

[1:59:12] says it's
[1:59:15] awful it leads to
[1:59:19] death my goodness
[1:59:24] when brother Jerry preached on this the
[1:59:28] Leviathan said

[1:59:34] a
[1:59:37] hook cord which let thou let us
[1:59:43] down his scales are his
[1:59:48] pride shut up together as with a closed
[1:59:50] seal

[1:59:56] arrogance
[1:59:59] swelling but watch who made

[2:05:39] sending
[2:05:41] us as you stand to your feet I'm going
[2:05:43] to ask you the question
[2:05:45] now I know because he gave me this
[2:05:47] message to preach to
[2:05:49] you I know that there's Pride in our
[2:05:53] heart small or
[2:05:59] big but I want to know how many here as
[2:06:01] you bow your
[2:06:05] heads we've got to check
[2:06:09] ourselves well I'm better than this one
[2:06:11] because I have more
[2:06:17] education and they
[2:06:19] don't that's okay you want to go but you
[2:06:22] should never feel better than anyone
[2:06:23] else because you
[2:06:26] do in your life God bless there's
[2:06:28] nothing
[2:06:30] wrong what's wrong is that when we look
[2:06:32] at others
[2:06:39] lesser you take a young girl that wants
[2:06:41] to be a
[2:06:44] housewife and people look down on
[2:06:48] that what do you
[2:06:50] mean that's the greatest thing that she
[2:06:52] could ever
[2:06:55] do you understand me I'm bringing a
[2:06:58] balance to
[2:07:00] things it's not about comparing
[2:07:03] comparing is caused by
[2:07:07] Pride to raise your brother and sister
[2:07:11] up whether you got a better job or she's
[2:07:14] got a better job or he's got a better
[2:07:16] who
[2:07:19] cares and we do all that he's called
[2:07:21] called us to
[2:07:23] do but never With
[2:07:28] Pride and where pride is not
[2:07:32] present there's no contention
[2:07:37] church because we see each other as Sons
[2:07:40] and Daughters of
[2:07:44] God so I ask is there anyone here that
[2:07:46] could say brother would you pray for me
[2:07:52] I don't want not one bit of pride in
[2:07:55] me coming of the Lord is so

[2:07:59] near so
[2:08:02] close don't let us be found with no
[2:08:04] pride

[2:08:09] fall when we're too proud just to say
[2:08:12] I'm
[2:08:15] sorry come on now when we can't
[2:08:18] apologize to one another
[2:08:21] that's pride pride don't let you that's
[2:08:25] why there's contention inside of
[2:08:31] us it won't let you humble yourself and
[2:08:34] and ask for
[2:08:37] forgiveness Pride does that to
[2:08:42] [Music]
[2:08:44] us I'll wait
[2:08:46] here the Lord's calling some
