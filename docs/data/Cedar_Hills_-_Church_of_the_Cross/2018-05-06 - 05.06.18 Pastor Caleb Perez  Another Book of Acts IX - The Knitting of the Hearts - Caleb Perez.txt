to try to make a little building for all of them in my kitchen stairs to Paris we definitely rely on the grace of God that meant a dependence thank you all for your efforts and what you your offerings and it has helped quite a few people already this person says where's John when it rains and they get rained upon cuando you have a same often how many would still come to church if you got rained on want to stock up in EMS servicio would you stand to your feet is opponent APA Amen yes and the last time we spoke we hit on on we're in another book of Acts still I'm gonna do the law say somebody remember the vanishing act what was the Quinn and elector that's Vanessa we're gonna continue on that let's but we're gonna take it a step farther but most I don't pass on Marcy says that most I don't believe that we can we can be prepared for the rapture can okay no study I must prepare and I believe that why we're here this morning is that right it okay for this was done because we want to be prepared for the rapture or kick a demo cetera I don't want to say I don't know about you but I don't want to stay June America there's no say we we have no idea we do in one sense but to really grasp what will happen they don't like but I play a cop a contest we have not seen those times yet bestows tiempos I own what a weight they locate suspect acts the fourth chapter in the 32nd verse H s capital of what relates to taint as those and well known Scripture and the multitude of them that believed the multitudinous kayvyun crazy so how many believers do we have what to say intestine emos and the multitude of them that believed were of one heart gang credo and one soul gerund in chorus Tony you nazma may God had his blessings to the reading of his word you may be seated bendiga I wanna I want to read it again and the multitude of them that believe in a multitude ellos que bien crazies were of one heart and a un corazon and one soul you nazma now brother Branham says in the message influenced in a sec hey influence the element of Rannazzisi you're in a condition right now who's this stand up on this you know I like this and I take this for myself who's to me you look tight take this for the church don't waste open you're in a condition right now to start a new Pentecostal men set on Pentecost level it certainly is true friends it's better that I meant a bow not he didn't say to start an organization no command seven organ he says you know not to start some denomination oh not then I mean that's the own but to start a new experience it'll come instead of experiencing driver and how do we start a new Pentecost if it will commence a Muslim Pentecost is no by coming back to the original scripture he got the multitude of them that believed were of one heart and one soul the East Aquila multitudinous Kevin kado Aaron don't correspond you'll and Amos the third chapter in the third verses where we are read last time a most capital of trees you can turn to real quick and it is a question that was being asked isn't a print at KCI hecho can two walk together except they be agreed and the Rondo's juntos he knows to be Aaron de acuerdo can two walk together for the end of those except they be of one heart si nos donde un corazon and of one soul the unanimous that's we realized then and those ascent and demos as we said last time this picture is use many times Esther's Couture Azusa when we disagree with someone when the state's done this acuerdo and we don't want to make an effort to walk with them in okay must settle it first of all they come and we simply say we cannot walk together because we disagree Cemal no point was coming that con usted porque estamos then it's easier just to say it and do it that way it's faster they see the lawyer said listen yes I do realize that no we cannot all and everyone around the world walk together Tendo canto santol mundo plane and there who does not everyone believes the same thing porque no tow screen la misma cosa but we do know it'll sister them that someone has taken the time alguien septum others to help raise our faith to another level but up we're live at mr. Farrell Toni this so that we can begin to walk one with the other but I am pathetic I mean I tell uno con el I thank the Lord for our founding pastor Lego Sinestro pastor so much time into helping us come tonight bringing our faith to another level I know what mr. felony they the same faith that was delivered to the Saints I miss my philosophy is the same faith that is continued is its continuing to be delivered to the Saints is the mismo que continúa en toda Dallas it has not stopped no Appa Rado and I believe that our children then their faith must be raised the same way our faith has been raised he can associate a means to fairly necessarily vada we many times think we because we come to church that we are Christians which erases grandmas Kippur kill any mustard we send my question is do you walk with Jesus he preguntas come in here walk with Jesus what does come in and conquer Seuss I must learn to walk with him I must learn to did I come in there because you cannot walk together with Jesus but you still awake I mean that okay so until first of all there has been an agreement between you and Jesus I stuck a pre matter I got you though not we're done anybody here made an agreement with him are they shown a quitter the constant can be agreement yet not quite as simple as simple it is an engagement assume compromise though a man if you have not made an agreement or been engaged to him denied come from Miss Torrell you'll never ever walk with him the way you're supposed to look Erica Mena Konerko most 0.07 he may be your savior and that's many people he is their Savior muchos notice he does not become your Lord then he can't you cannot walk with him except to senior know us because how can two walk together unless they be agreed first of all oh come on and those who knows you knows Tonya when I have to learn to walk with Christ who is the word they were the upendra caminar con Cristo and there I must learn how to walk with my brothers and my sisters slow up indirect caminar con mis hermanos this is where many people even in the message they miss it I can tell one element circulate I'm not throwing at anyone you're looking at anyone I look in the mirror yeah nothing invalid if you learn the particulars is because there's always there has always been this stigma thirteen possessed a stigma and it sticks with people yes they can i connect it and though they may say they I don't believe that you know can you and you're not Creole but there are things that stay with us even from the denominational realm there are courses case I can and you know sort of on the low denomination and things that have been taught through the years versus case an insane yellow Trello such as the rapture is simply one of these days we'll be driving in our car and wound work will be out of here but a hip looking were trapped on the almost human hand we know so I must say well though we may say we may say well I don't believe it like that no more young Kenny got most general career because God sent a prophet and in this message he has taught us what the rapture really is because you're some moments ahead on profit diagnosis then you'll come well but yet in our own actions fairness the sexy honest we live like the Pentecostals believe it came was como la créme los Pentecostal is because we try to or or many times we want to get to ourselves only porque tenemos que nosotros not loss we really don't believe that a rapture is a whole body of believers it's some way we still think it is I'm gonna fly off one of these days it was a twelve men take Karami sidewall and Ono's that's not the way the Bible teaches it there are no estelle merkulov is not the way our prophet taught it let's draw a prophet and Allah say no then why do we in this many times on bean by ourselves and never join in our hearts and souls as one para por que nos vemos per sec I'm gonna swing and lower the entire nose believe me about a Sonia I try to study another subject can't make it at this you had a throat and the Holy Spirit will just get my face and turn is it you know over here yeah what's gonna cut out now yeah but this is awesome oh yes but I'm not there right now it's what I want right here si pero aquí son de lo quiero unity Unni dad togetherness afternoon wherever we go we preach that you know the Karakoram was penny not a false unity no no his army their united also forget them is that the message to the church is out there are uniting nothing less than Union though but there has to be a true Union better Tina came Antonio car you know hiding of time and silent imposes saying L is an invisible Union on your name is that is taking place between the groom and the bride if there's not you ill Nov out we we believe then that we are part of that Union how many believe that this morning because almost better you are in your heart of that Union this morning if there's birthdays only on what is real case and what is truth he case better than pilot asked the question below to a pilot oh you so laugh but even what else truth guess where does everybody claims we have the truth but it doesn't Clement then M 11 that we're here this morning we believe that we're preaching the truth estamos aqui break and ok end ok Perry Como's Lebanon others and the question resonates Allah what is case but how do we know that what we perceive as truth is real vamos vamos que lo que Presta famous case where that is really a lot of things to believe in I wish of course as a career and here believe in something but to believe in something in akk durango we're made as human beings were made to believe in something somos nature's rapid and now you go when we look at this what it really is truth ok is but I meant ever done because we all perceive things differently look at all persevere most las casas diferente yes look at your neighbor hey is this luiseño you and your neighbor you perceive things totally different stations you know perceiving las casas de ferran theta one if you look at all the ladies see myristate oil as de mas and husbands you know this is true in they perceive so many things so different than the men perceive intent does cause at indifferentism man perceives things totally different from the from the women in law swampers personal diferente de la mujer and I both who say they believe the truth it taught me I'm both Korean but I don't say like that I don't see it the way you see it how is it like that you know see everyone is perceiving things depending on where they're at so the tempers dvn de las casas dependent understanding when I see these things it cuando estés it's the reason that us as humans Corazon de Soto's c'mon man we can't agree on very many things most was eternity acuerdo muchos I guarantee you that if we sat down and had a conversation you're kissing no st. Thomas not then in a company that would probably be more things we disagree about them than we agree upon very Moscow Salinas quality estamos de snack where those promises started I love Mexican food or no not me gusta la cumbia no no I like Italian I mean Melissa italiana okay that's fine en well I like driving a car while I like driving a truck I mean based on control it doesn't matter it was everything little little thing in life we would probably disagree about the majority of things but yet was telling this equivalent of course is my idea they and all of us are hearing the message this morning it also en de esta mañana yet everyone is capturing it from a different perspective it's all estándares de viento the zero perspective if you came in you're mad at your spouse you stay yucky you know how are your manners your children Lucia or you're mad at your at your parents or in Ohio coasters Papa you're hearing it with a certain perspective lost a Yentl misaki-kun apostolate for everything maybe many of you aren't even paying attention smooches nice because your mind is all my gosh I got in a fight this morning porque su mente the style maybe esta muerto I get up out of church and I'm gonna really let them have it your perspective is different right now even when we're happier when we're sad our perspectives different I don't come there's almost content oh so no

I just washed my saddle what's the matter they were there still chirping the same way no come on because your perspective is different that's perspective and you look at human beings Mira uno Los Zetas who might be perspect we perceive things so differently it's the women of cosa standest into all of us are hearing a message all systems are in demand say okay which perspective is true this morning that okay perception is defect it's better estimate what perspective is your perspective or their perspective or yours or yours respective is that correct it's the mystery is with me studio
