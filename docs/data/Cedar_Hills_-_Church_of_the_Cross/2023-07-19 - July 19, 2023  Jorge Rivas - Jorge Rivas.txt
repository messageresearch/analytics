you can be so kind let us all stand Supernatural inspiration in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ Our Lord amen we are going to turn in our scriptures First Corinthians that's the first first book of Corinthians of the Apostle Paul and we are going to read verse two Corinthians 2 15 and 16. it says this way but he that is spiritual judges all things yet he himself is judged of no man okay foreign that he may instruct him but we have the mind of Christ you may be seated we are going to try to consider tonight we want to entitle it as the scripture tells us it is according our scripture is the mind of Christ the mind of the Lord or of course we understand today the brother Brandon when he speaks about the human part he tells us he shows us that the mind is in the spirit the intelligence is also in the spirit and he says that the mind is the womb of the spirit womb is where the thoughts are begotten comes to our mind the prophet of God says that we cannot we cannot uh disturb okay that the birds will come to the tree but we can disturb or or they that they won't make a mess that there are thoughts that come from God and thoughts that come from the devils and we also have to be not only in the capacity but also in the decision which thought we will let govern our minds that is in our mind when those thoughts are begotten when they are begotten we start to speak them when we speak them they are words the twain thoughts of God are the devil they come to us and and second two yes and verse verse 5. they say s casting down in imaginations and every High thing that exalted itself against the knowledge of God is and bring it into captivity every thought to The Obedience of Christ the scripture there is tells us that we should take into captivity and bring them to the mind of Christ it means that we should be in that capacity to bring the every thought that is against the word of God to bring every argument there arises against the word of God and bring it to to The Obedience and captivity to Christ it means that the people we should be in the capacity wrap everything not to argue the prophet of God says you don't resolve anything by arguing there are a battle of quotes and scriptures here and there you know and we have not called to argue with no one throw a quote here or there no but to maintain ourselves with the sufficient understanding of what of the Lord not just of the text not just the knowledge of the of the message or of the scriptures Apostle Paul spoke to the to the Ephesians that we should come to the knowledge of the Son of God revelation of the Son of God of who he is to you the capacity of the bride of Christ to be able to discern the thought that comes from God the thought that is against God of what God is to be able to capture or to Captivate every contrary objected to the word of God now in order for us to have the thoughts of Christ we have to have the mind of Christ and how can we have the mind of Christ the Bible tells us in Philippians that we should have the same mind that was in Christ the same mind that was in him has to come and humble ourselves and to become servants not for us to do away and for us but to be able to have the capacity to take the form of a servant to fulfill the Divine Purpose maybe today and to be able to surrender ourselves to a physical death maybe we feel like that is the only way they said to be able to serve the purpose of the Gospel no neces but it's not necessarily talking about going and surrendering your physical life so that Christ will be born in me I am crucified with Christ and he would say who shall deliver me from this he said what I want to do that's what I don't do what I don't want to do that's what I do Paul then was dying every day what was he dying to as he means to himself and when he died to himself for him to die to himself first of all he had to die to his own mind because until we become right to our own things until we capture them and subject them we can then never receive the thought of God a woman that is pregnant she cannot receive a seed there is and to have a double pregnancy when she's already pregnant that's why Paul said he would become it would become that old seed has to die so that a new or a clean seats every word is a seed originated in the mind of a person and for the mind of Christ for it to come to us it cannot be begotten though the the word of God cannot be begotten in me until I die to my own thoughts now the way that we should die daily yes it's to die to our own ideas through our own arguments because the scripture says it has to be brought with a mind that's always bombarded with all kinds of different things the greatest battle ever fought and has always been foreign [Music] we should then go have to go back to how the mind of the man operated before and when we find Adam in the garden something was interrupted When sin came into the garden and what was interrupted many things could have come to pass but there was something that had to come first for the other things come to manifestation before sin is the manifestation and now manifestation is the expression Revelation is the Revelation it's to make known manifestation a manifestation of the of the thoughts of God the prophet of God teaches us that the first son that was going to come in the garden was Jesus and he was going to come through The Incorruptible seed he would come through the word of God what interrupted them what's the manifestation of the sons of God the sons of God that were to be made where only them that were in the mind of God they he was going to express that seed over the Earth that's the first thing that had to come yes and that was the first thing that was hindered because of sin in the garden when God then was going to take over again what was hindered he takes it again where he left us if you are then writing the numbers from one to ten and you go to the number three the plan was interrupted in the precise moment when the sons of God because I'm part of that because you are also part of that when the sons of God where we would be made Manifesto and and sin disturb them but the plan of God did not change and when God foreign Son of God Oda okay what does God await for us to do today what does God await for us to speak what God awaits of us wants from us is for us concerning you it's real easy for you and I today to to identify the manifestation of the Son of God of the only begotten son foreign that is fine but I for them when Adam was going to call for Jesus the plan was was held up but in the time of God in this plan he's gonna retake those those thoughts that maintain themselves in his mind that they stayed in an abstract then he retakes them and he speaks them for manifestation and Jesus appears upon the face Jesus had the mind of God the thought that God had which was before the foundation of the world for him it's to say that Jesus knew what he was supposed to do when brother Branham comes today he's manifested as a Son of God and he identifies what God thought look at the other ones to maintain what God had in his mind before the foundation concerning himself and I was not manifested then because sin interrupted but in the God's plan he retakes in the order that God had those thoughts to be made manifest on the earth come to my day then the Lord he encounters himself to me I remember or recognize the mind of God the thoughts that God has before the foundation concerning me [Music] is to be made that God will take care of each and every details then I need to understand that every word that man speaks he will take be accountable be it good or evil okay you know when brother Brown would speak to his wife concerning of the three great greatest men that that were born in Kentucky and his wife would say Billy you're gonna start and it was a very innocent uh joke every one of us we play jokes on our children but brother Branham but he said I had to leave that is he said because he would cite because every every word that comes out of the man we will be held because every word brings a seed the prophet of God says it doesn't matter how your children walk tell the very best of them because every word is a seed and express through our own existence to express everything that was was detained because of sin and we should then be careful what we speak and before we spoke we had to think about them the idea or the locals had to come foreign that the greatest company that there is in the world the most that is the most outstanding and lucrative is the company of the entertainment industry and it maintains the people entertained in in in in in all the the networks social networking entertainment in there in video games because what he wants to do is warp the mind of this generation and no longer have the mind of God that's why this generation is a generation there they're a mind of thinking they are captivated by thinking of hell but the people of God are young or older people we should be willing to renounce all of that activity takes away my mind from the thinking of God and I should occupy myself daily of every Saturday to captivity for the word of God and then you can go and use the social workings to find your identity before the my the before God I wanna he pays attention to the mind and Christ is the head of the body of Christ of his church then the body of Christ foreign the feminist part of God and being that the that the head came down it spoke through its meaning and the mouth of God is a prophet he spoke to us the word of God and the word of God has made us known the thoughts of God now today taking the message that God brought us a doubt what God has brought through us to through his mouth being that if I understand or don't understand it's the mind of God being expressed through his word and we trap the mind of God and subject ourselves how then is the lord of the earth and when he created all the animals the Lord created all the animals upon the face of the Earth and he brought them to Adam to see what he would name them and Adam put place the name to Every Creature why did he call the horse a horse I want to bring your attention to this a moment how did Adam encounter the word horse why isn't the horse called an eagle but it's why is the ego named an eagle remember the atom at that moment had not Fallen it was to disturb man for him not to capture the thought of the mind of God and in capturing the thought of the mind of God for him to speak but when the Lord brought the animals to Adam Adam had not Fallen as of yet he was in that condition of it sufficiently in the image of God and when each animal was brought to Atlanta Adam had in himself the inspiration that's Supernatural elements you and I call today Revel and he identified Every Creature according to its characteristics because of the appearance of how he appeared to adamant but because Adam had the mind of God as Adam had the mind of God the thought of God and him by inspiration capture the thought and he spoke and it does not matter how much time passed by what of God is expressed correctly there will not be enough demons in hell that can ever be hey the sons of God to be made manifested today that means that there will be no one for there is a Son of God that would not that would fail to be there but everyone that was in the thought of God that before the foundation of the world they will not failed to make sure that they will come forward as the horse cannot stop from being a horse and no one can change its mind the son of God has always been and will always continue to be a son and it does not matter what hell calls you is that will not change the name that God gave you Joshua was there with all the Giants in that battle and and the light of the day was going away Joshua knew that if the the sun would go down that the enemies would regroup they would have time to eat and recover their strength it would be very difficult to destroy them but in the inspiration of God Joshua knew that God had given them the Victory and he could not let that moment and Joshua by inspiration of God inspiration is inspiration of God is not a killing spoke prayer was the cause foreign and the thought of God was manifested Moses before the Red Sea because and when he was before the Red Sea he said Lord what what should I do and Lord help me what should I do and you and I we know what happened Moses didn't need to ask God but he says I've already showed you if I've already trained in private and in public Moises the Moses speak how did Moses know that what he had would open up the Red Sea why didn't he ask for both foreign look at these Egyptians I want you to see them very good because from here on today you're never going to see them again he says and Moses are looking because Moses entered into the Divine channel that took him straight to the mind of God captured the mind of God he knew exactly what he is so sure he knew that no one would would pass except those that were under him where were the squirrels that were created today brother Branham didn't put God into a problem and God didn't say uh where am I going to get these squirrels from when he said the first one came to being he said he didn't say that was enough no no no no no God said no no no no I have I have kept these squirrels from the beginning I can no longer hold them best it's the day that you have to come and speak those a squirrel came from a place that there would never be a squirrel it didn't matter the adversity that is he cannot remain with it he has to let it goes when you are under sickness and Hell pressures the devil will always try to confound your mind the hurt of your body he tries to confound your mind he black foreign principio against two the one we read at the very beginning but I'm not going to read it from the very beginning and I didn't read it from the very beginning so that I could save time but look at verse 9. that says that the spirit and the bride say the same thing how is it that the bride says the same thing that the spirit says she has the mind of God but brother how do I I work that out how do I get to that place first Corinthians chapter 2 and verse 9 it says is it but it is written as it is written I have not seen ombre neither have entered into the Harvest the things which God had prepared for them that love him forgive me for saying what I'm going to say I know that all the revelations forgive me for what I'm going to say I know that all the Revelation that the prophet is you could know that all that description could be applied to all of that is but I want I want to put us into a into the hard place do you know that there are three kinds of Believers and the three kinds of believers they can they can go and admire the the revelations of the of the Middle East but this scriptures in its Essence it does not speak of three kinds of if there was something that could go out to three kinds of Believers classes there there are two kinds that will never understand and only the genuine Believers will understand it that's why verse 10 says he said Peru says but half now listen less it does not say no in espanol they say no as us knows God hath revealed them unto us for Real Estate by his spirit for the spirit searches all things yay the Deep things of God what is deeper than the God's own mind and the Holy Spirit comes so that you would know the deeper things of the mind of God according concerning your s intended I didn't I didn't I don't think that I I got you today what was the Holy Ghost given foreign Spirit witches of God that we might know the things that are freely given to us the holy spirit is given to me so that I will know okay that what God has given to me and what how do I know what God has given to me that's the same thing that Adam that Moses that Joshua that William Branham they kept it is the holy spirit will reveal to us the things concerning about us before the foundation that's why the Holy Ghost was given to us and why do we hear so much words how how come we have so much services and we hear so many tapes the Revelation comes by the hearing of the word of God not knowledge the Revelation heard but it did not profit because it was not mixed with faith those that hurt it and Revelation is the supernatural albums of God is and it permits you to know or to recognize the purpose that God had about you is the prophet of God says that God took a picture of you before the turn of the world and when I find myself and I know what God said about me shall know even as also I am known and foreign and that's why the spirit and the bride say come they're doing me forgive me I want to respect the time uh Juan Cinco John is strawberries are on top of the case 19 of John yeah if you reset him tell me it was so good here I would say I can't speak there okay because I'm not going to finish yeah how many sons does God have the second question is how many of us are sons of God but how many sons does God have uh God only had one they only begotten of the Father the only begotten of the father makes God reveals but the reason that you and I are sons of God is that is because we are part of the only begotten and if the only begotten son does not do anything unless the father show him and I am in only begotten son of the father I am a member of the body of Christ Anton says then I can do nothing [Applause] how to then I get to the place where I see the father do it foreign [Applause] [Applause] he didn't ask me to do that that's why I don't do that do you understand me oh he says Moses go and Liberate the people Joshua don't let them go over there Adam go and put them names Thomas what would he tell him what who would know what God has for the brothers is the business of food of him and God will reveal to him by the holy spirit that he gave to him and he will know the depth of God individual and there is nothing that nothing deeper for the individual than to know who he is and when he knows who he is in the Bible that anyone can ever have it doesn't matter it does not deal with who is everybody else to Abraham it was fine what God asked of it but God is asking something of me God wants something of you is simply by the depth of God which the holy spirit will take you in your life Can you capture the thought of God concerning you foreign that's why the body has many members everyone in particular what God has given to you concerning you do it but just assure yourself that it is God's thoughts it is not the manifestation of the sons of God in the future that is a full videos it's the correct inspiration in the correct channel to the correct individual for you to know what is the mind of God when God reveals to you by divine inspiration the purpose which he has for you there's nothing that can is take it away it's a seal no one can find it no one can go against it there's no words it's an explosion of Life foreign thank you inclination I want you to buy your heads and we're
