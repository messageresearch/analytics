[32:14] [Music]
[32:16] in your history and we're just thankful
[32:18] for this opportunity
[32:19] to speak to all the young people
[32:28] [Music]
[32:36] just want to thank god for the
[32:37] opportunity and
[32:41] confidence that our pastor would have to
[32:43] speak to
[32:44] us
[32:54] if you would like let's go ahead and
[32:56] open our bibles to we are not releasing
[32:58] vbs
[32:59] to our first scripture
[33:03] and we're going to be going to the book
[33:07] of exodus
[33:15] praise the lord how many are happy to be
[33:17] here tonight
[33:19] they had this opportunity to worship the
[33:22] lord
[33:24] [Music]
[33:37] we're going to read a little bit about
[33:38] the story tonight of moses
[33:43] and we're going to continue on our
[33:45] message to preach in the spirit
[33:54] amen are you ready for the subtitle was
[33:58] was kind of hard on me even
[34:04] that
[34:14] amen we're going to find out how that
[34:17] affects
[34:17] all of us whether we realize it or not
[34:25] let's start here with verse 4
[34:29] and he hewed two tables of stone like
[34:31] unto the first
[34:33] and moses rose up early in the morning
[34:36] and went up onto the mount sinai as the
[34:39] lord had commanded him
[34:41] and took in his hands the two tables of
[34:44] stone
[34:46] museum
[34:54] and the lord descended in a cloud and
[34:56] stood with him there
[34:58] and proclaimed the name of the lord
[35:06] and the lord passed by before him and
[35:09] proclaimed
[35:11] the lord the lord god merciful and
[35:14] gracious
[35:15] long-suffering and abundant in goodness
[35:35] and moses made haste and bowed his head
[35:38] toward the earth and worshipped
[35:47] and he said if now i found grace and i
[35:50] say
[35:50] oh lord let me my lord i pray thee
[35:54] go amongst us for it is a stiffness
[35:58] people and and pardon our iniquity
[36:03] and our sin and take us for
[36:06] ghanaian health
[36:22] actually let's go back to verse 7.
[36:28] i mentioned it and then i skipped it and
[36:30] this is one of the key verses we're
[36:32] going to be hitting tonight
[36:34] verse 7. i read part of it but not all
[36:36] of it keeping mercy
[36:38] for thousands for giving
[36:41] iniquity and transgression of sin
[36:44] and that will by no means clear the
[36:47] guilty
[36:49] visiting the iniquity of the fathers
[36:51] upon the children
[36:54] and upon the children's children and to
[36:57] the third
[36:58] and to the fourth generations
[37:15] amen now let's go to first peter chapter
[37:20] one
[37:22] and we're going to start with verse 18.
[37:29] how many i can hear those bibles turn i
[37:31] like that
[37:46] to speak god's word amen
[37:50] for as much as you know that you were
[37:52] not redeemed with corruptible things as
[37:54] silver and gold
[37:57] from your vain conversation received
[38:01] by tradition
[38:15] but with the precious blood of christ
[38:19] as of a lamb without blemish and without
[38:22] spot
[38:29] who verily was before the foundation of
[38:32] the world
[38:33] now i want you to take this person
[38:37] it was way before the world began
[38:42] but it was manifest in these last times
[39:10] who by him do you believe in god that
[39:12] raised him up from the dead
[39:14] and gave him glory that your faith and
[39:18] hope
[39:18] might be in god
[39:26] now
[39:39] but the message of the hour came to
[39:41] reveal the bible
[39:47] the message of the hour came to reveal
[39:51] the bible
[39:54] i like to turn it around too
[39:57] the bible reveals the message of the
[40:00] hour
[40:02] praise the lord seeing that ye have
[40:05] purified your souls and obeying the
[40:07] truth
[40:08] through the spirit and to unfeel
[40:11] love of the brethren that word on thin
[40:14] there means
[40:15] pure without hypocrisy
[40:36] is
[40:48] i'm gonna get to this verse a little
[40:50] later on almost like you got to stay
[40:51] with us
[40:53] lord jesus thank you tonight
[40:58] as we report
[41:01] as we have surrendered our every part of
[41:05] our being
[41:08] to your service lord and we pray that
[41:12] your spirit will
[41:13] open up our understanding
[41:17] and you help us to realize the great
[41:20] things that you have
[41:21] already given us
[41:26] now bless your word to each heart
[41:30] for we ask it all in the precious name
[41:32] of our lord and savior jesus
[41:34] christ
[41:40] now this is my third message on the
[41:42] breach
[41:43] in the spirit
[41:58] the lord is bringing this out to me he
[42:01] brought it to me from a different angle
[42:07] a wholesome tongue is a tree
[42:11] of life
[42:16] that word wholesome there means is a
[42:18] palabra passively significant
[42:19] healthy is lovely
[42:26] it means a quality of
[42:30] words coming out of your mouth or off of
[42:32] this
[42:33] tongue
[42:37] are nothing but life
[42:41] so a wholesome tongue is a
[42:45] tree of life
[42:49] and how is it that we can have a
[42:51] wholesome time
[42:54] because the scripture tells them
[43:10] you might be
[43:20] must come out even jesus told the
[43:23] religious
[43:24] people of that time
[44:18] and we went through that in our other
[44:19] messages that that battery
[44:25] is something that has continued to
[44:27] happen to each one of us
[44:32] from the time that we were born on this
[44:35] planet
[44:38] amen the word bridge
[44:41] now you know i had wanted to
[44:45] preach this message a little sooner
[44:50] and i actually had the opportunity to do
[44:52] that and i i just didn't
[44:53] feel right about it yet
[44:58] and i'm gonna get personal with the
[45:00] young people is that okay establishing
[45:14] [Applause]
[45:21] how many remember what the holy spirit
[45:23] said to our pastor
[45:25] two sundays
[45:32] what is the enemy actor
[45:37] what does he want to take away from us
[45:42] what did he take away from samson
[45:58] what does he want from you anybody
[46:03] what i can't understand
[46:08] there's lots okay i'm sorry these masks
[46:10] don't help me that much
[46:14] okay the secret
[46:17] amen good job sister praise the lord
[46:22] that that secret that that part of the
[46:26] mystery
[46:28] my goodness do you know that you are a
[46:31] part of the mystery
[46:36] amen according to the message of the
[46:38] hour
[46:40] he says we are a
[47:08] we know the condensation down to our
[47:10] pastor
[47:13] the husbands and so forth
[47:16] but he says in christ the mystery
[47:18] releasing
[47:20] that we are a part
[47:37] you know the difference between samson
[47:39] and you and i is
[47:40] the difference at one point
[47:43] all of us we didn't
[47:47] know our part of the mystery
[47:50] no
[48:14] but to you young people that have not
[48:17] discovered what that secret
[48:28] and you will live this life
[48:46] how he would reveal himself
[48:50] in the last days
[48:54] isn't that always the question
[48:58] [Music]
[49:00] i'm
[49:18] now in this scripture here in first
[49:20] period
[49:23] it talks about the vain conversation
[49:26] of the conversation the tradition
[49:31] of our tradition
[49:34] he says our conversation in times past
[49:41] and why we acted the
[49:57] conversation is actually behavior
[50:03] why did we act and behave the way we did
[50:09] because of the main traditions
[50:12] that were brought down through our
[50:15] family tree
[50:19] familiarity if you're getting into some
[50:22] delicate stuff
[51:03] go ahead and play that first one
[51:05] gentlemen up there
[51:06] funeral ways maneras
[51:10] are connected with our ancestry
[51:16] amen they're connected feudal things not
[51:19] connected
[51:20] to valor
[51:35] all right that's why the word
[51:38] vein there in the scripture in first
[51:41] peter
[51:41] 1
[51:45] it is
[52:17] my what a word worthless
[52:23] the word that really gets me out of all
[52:25] of these is this next word
[52:29] and i want you to take it in a
[52:46] one of the definitions we all know is
[52:48] prematurely born
[52:52] but watch this it also means imperfectly
[52:56] formed
[52:57] or developed
[53:12] to terminate a procedure prematurely
[53:18] oh that one gets me yes young people
[53:22] over this if we want to get to this part
[53:26] of the secret
[53:41] abort the process or stop it in
[53:45] its early stages
[53:50] that's the only chance the enemy has
[53:54] to keep you from finding out who you are
[53:57] in christ
[54:01] what your part of the plan of god is
[54:21] amen you're justified
[54:24] you repented and you were baptized in
[54:26] the name of the lord jesus christ
[54:29] amen how many have been sanctified
[54:36] oh my now remember sanctification
[54:41] is a greek it's a compound greek word
[54:46] that means cleanse
[55:04] and set aside for services
[55:07] and the bible says we are washed
[55:11] ephesians 5 by the water
[55:15] of the world
[55:17] [Music]
[55:50] [Music]
[56:00] but
[56:11] the future home of the heavenly
[56:13] bridegroom with the earthly
[56:42] a hard time forgetting so many things we
[56:45] wish we could forget
[56:49] that first of all your memory
[56:54] each one lived at least 20 years
[57:38] we know our prophet never literally
[57:40] preached the message
[57:42] the trail of the surface
[57:47] he mentions it in six messages
[57:50] all preached in 1965
[58:07] it one of those times
[58:10] how could that tell the serpent be where
[58:13] god's place of worship could be
[58:30] [Music]
[58:32] every day of your life
[58:49] los errores that we made puerto rico
[58:53] and and the feudal ways that we traveled
[58:59] we we didn't know any better no no not
[59:13] why is it that when we get so close to
[59:15] what we've been struggling for
[59:45] is when you get to a point and you
[59:46] realize you can't
[59:48] change yourself
[59:53] and some of the things you're doing you
[59:55] know they're wrong
[59:59] [Music]
[1:00:12] is
[1:00:52] let's go to the next clip gentlemen
[1:00:59] no more
[1:01:03] what really bothers me
[1:01:07] is to see people in
[1:01:21] and they don't want to change nokia in
[1:01:23] cambia
[1:01:24] and when you come to this message
[1:01:29] you must die to all of that
[1:01:33] my mind
[1:01:47] itself in your heart
[1:02:03] if you terminate the procedure
[1:02:11] you'll never know what it's like to have
[1:02:12] the nature of your soul
[1:02:16] control your spiritual
[1:02:32] justification sanctification
[1:02:36] baptism of the holy land the prophet
[1:02:39] says
[1:02:40] he's the prophet
[1:02:43] are completed
[1:03:00] you've repented and
[1:03:27] but until you receive that
[1:03:56] gentlemen how about you two more clicks
