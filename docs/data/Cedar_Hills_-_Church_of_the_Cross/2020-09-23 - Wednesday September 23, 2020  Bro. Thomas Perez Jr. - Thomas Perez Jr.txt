[Applause] oh [Applause] hallelujah [Music] [Music] oh [Music] [Applause] thank you for a very good job very great job tonight and grateful to the lord jesus we have been hearing some messages that are just out of this world and we want to thank the lord jesus christ and god's servant our pastor for the for for the word that has been coming forth out of this desk or video that that you can see for the for for it's about two hours two hours no it's about two minutes go ahead if you would there was a recent study by the center for bible engagement where they pulled 40 000 uh general population in the u.s from eight to eighty and they just wanted to see how we are engaging with scripture right and they discovered the study right um when we're in the scripture one time a week and that could be church on sunday that's pastor saying you open your bible we hear the message one time a week had negligible effect on some key areas of your life so i'm gonna spell that out more here in a moment two times a week negligible effect now at three times a week there was a blip on the map like there was a heartbeat something happened you would expect that it'd be one two i mean there'd be a gradual link line on the effect an impact that would have in your life but it was literally one two three four something radically happens okay you got my curiosity to this extent what kind of behavior is being effective uh bitterness in relationships marriage a relationship with your kids and so on drops 40 percent alcoholism drops 57 feeling spiritually hurtfully stagnant ask them the question how much time do you spend in the scripture if they're in the scripture four times a week or more it drops 60 percent wow viewing pornography drops 61 that's very important now on a flip positive side sharing your faith jumps 200 percent wow because you have a confidence in god's word and then discipling others jumps 230 that's that's amazing right there [Music] i'm going to ask you to stand once again and you thought we were just here just to spend time prosper to the coming of the lord prosperous we're going to go into a into a book that that that that i don't very go very often into and i don't know about you but i don't know very happy to have my wife with us here tonight and i told her if she didn't if she if she wouldn't come back soon that that we'd have to put a visitor or guest tag on her well that that you know if he didn't have her we'd be in in a lot of trouble so we did a problem we're grateful to her for for her her faithfulness and what she but i but i thank her for coming to be with me tonight [Applause] or then will i turn to the people a pure language that they may all call upon the name of the toast lord jesus we're grateful to be in your house tonight we ask father that your word will accomplish the purpose that it was sent for tonight and may you receive all honor in all glory gloria for you are the only devil but be thus saith the lord we place ourselves in your hands until you may be seated amen amen how many have been enjoying the word of god here here my uncle abraham here our pastor here the all the different brothers that are the most privileged people upon the face of the world i'm not saying that there aren't other people that are privileged do you know what the word of god does in your heart you know what it does in your soul and i so much appreciated brother henry that that was probably the best message i've ever heard him preach that i have heard and have read and it says don't never let your testimony be negative let it be positive all the time he he would never let us say that he had a stroke because he he he believed with all of his heart we don't give him we don't we don't give a testimony and said this is what the devil did to us don't never let your testimony be negative will make you go crazy too much of the wrong thing will make you go crazy now you've heard our pastor and i'm going to probably go over a few things that that he has he has spoken to us that's great that's wonderful to now impart it to somebody else which the author says i believe it is then this nation is morally bankrupt and emotionally immature can't keep a you find that all the time everywhere you go something so easily like should i go to church it's sunday think so easily like i'm sick who should i call i'll go until he saw the person without feet unstable in established emotional mental health it is failure of maturity is in the fire and they decided that they were going to keep prayer out of school what did they expect when they rejected god from out of the equation when we ourselves understand the word of god that is word would remain eternal what happens when you take the ten commandments out of the school what happens when you take the ten commandments out of the court system what happens when you take god out of our emotions will tell us that we have to be happy when we're sad i come to church with a sureness of faith which started a good working community we're talking about that but let me tell you our children see us up or down and they've got to know where the stability that the answer for our day generator will produce the same effect evaporator it says this for i have received of the lord that also which i delivered unto you that the lord jesus the same night in which he was betrayed took bread when he had given thanks gracias he break it and said he tells us in saint john that he was the bread that he is the bread of life that came down from heaven he's telling the people that he is giving out what he has received in other words if he have not received anything else except the eternal what and and you know you you see him there at the rest home he gave himself for us paranos amen he gave himself for us but this was a man that left everything come help me what do you receive from the message of the hour that's the same thing that he delivered to us there was nothing else but what which is broken breaks off of peace but this body was broken and he said that every time you do this for me jonathan what i did for you in my body that's what jesus is saying just look at jesus remember how i took you out of sin remember how i healed you remember when i gave you the holy ghost the word of god doesn't say this is my a great thing because it would be quickly but he said this was my body which was broken and all of a sudden we come to church and because we don't up yet but i want to tell you get out of this that the bread of god afflicts it'll bring out the best in you and i'll pressure you it'll bring you to the place that's why many people can't eat this bread that's why many people can't can't do what is required that's why in church people act one way and outside they act a different way because anyways outside brother i can i can relax can you imagine a person that tries to serve god and serve the devil you can't do it unless you add leaven to your life it's all right if i cut my hair you just and he thinks he's the only one says that that the minister's not right no more and the children said we didn't like the bread i [Applause] or after a while we can't sing as loud anymore for a while we can't we can't work for the lord no more you know why the world creeps in the moon the word of god when brother branham says that one man one woman out of line can cause the whole church to face because you know why little levin came in it's all right to do all of these things it wasn't all right in the beginning in the beginning we went to hear god's word remember when you came out of egypt amen remember when you came out of egypt where were you when that man went to go pick you up you remember when you came into the message how you'd hear tapes they're foreign you remember and the reason it doesn't penetrate because the world has creeped in and when the world creeped in with leaven god went right out and you tried the same rapper and one day we will go to church for the last time i want to receive the holy ghost the holy ghost has gone in especially yesterday our sincerity went out you know every day we should remind ourselves what we were okay and what were but what happens a little bit at a time i don't mean that disrespect that's okay i understand you're my buddy we all know those things what happens is a little leaven that las cruces is too far and i have to check my life i'm coming to hear his [Applause] and all of a sudden brother branham tells us if you've got the nature of god in you there there's even a scriptures to say to shun all appearance of evil if you've got the nature of god in you for the right thing you'll do the right thing you will think the right way you'll live the right thing if you're a nobody gonna tell me to raise my hands you just got a little levin in your in yourself i don't need nobody to tell me to raise my hands but sometimes people need to be helped can you smile you raise your hand say glory to god can you wave your hand these are free people that like christ i ascent again i gotta say it again if you lie if you're a christian christian you like christ he's your bridegroom yeah we heard sunday about clothes the clothes never wore out this is this is one of the greatest one some of the greatest things that we hear but in verse three he says what is this thing to a point unto them that mourn in zion to give them beauty for ashes many want to give them all give your all your toils all your problems everything that you have to do the oil of joy for morning says you sing songs of joy when the minister says how many love the lord get up out of your chairs you're probably going to have oil on your clothes right okay if you're a barber you're definitely going to have hair on your clothes everybody distinguishes you by what clothes you wear and when you come to the house of the lord but when you come to the house of the lord when you speak and you say hallelujah he gave you his whole life don't ever forget when he came yo perdido so that you could sit where you're at right now so when i sit in my cushion who's a christian and the little boy that was being burned to see jesus in a few minutes you know why do this and remembrance of me yes was mine that wasn't even third that wasn't even 33 years old that was 33 and a half years old he comes and he gives us opportunities he tells peter i want you to know that peter was the man nothing should have kept him away that he should have been strong sister silver and yet as he's done as they're whipping him did not that should have lasted peter his whole life three times this is what jesus does he's got his he's he's got to get all these three denials he is you're going to deny me three times what's that i negotiate his business and he heard anything and he hears escucha from women that he had resurrected he's gotta go is he's got to cancel it out then that one's gone peter pedro now see the pentagon do you love me miamas and i come and i say lord you know what i love that specimen shedding of the blood denials so is i see our pastor hold really fast do this in remembrance of me again when you go when you go and ask him for help and he gives you something for you to help recep when you remember him you've heard this before loans he goes into the little room into a study studio and he says i didn't know what the first seal was pablo and brother branham meet up for the you'll be you are the man that went to the ovens of god oh and break the bread and make the bread and into the heart of the man y'all correspond together not not the not something to the what the hidden manner was a special revelation because he had to teach others sunday morning you're not hearing a rerun you're not

is god doing for us today what has he come to bring us brother branham would say this it isn't me his words will fail come on church what are we doing today it is not a time to retire it's a time to refire as i've prayed to the lord every morning and he says i have something to tell you you say you look to the left let's go forward don't look right it's just in front of us is unstable in all his ways jesus says i have come you have been evil and you might have life that more abundantly freely add you everything if you're going to do it do it good i want to say that when was the last time you
