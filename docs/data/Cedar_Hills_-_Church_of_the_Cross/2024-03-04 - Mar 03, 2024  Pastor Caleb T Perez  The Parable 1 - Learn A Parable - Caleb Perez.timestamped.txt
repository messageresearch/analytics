[26:07] hill hill has a testimony and a special
[26:10] right
[26:11] after God bless
[26:18] you Romans 8
[26:21] verse4 for as many as are L by the
[26:25] spirit of God they are the son of God
[26:29] Romans 8 verse 15 for ye have not
[26:33] received the spirit of bondage against
[26:36] to fear but ye have received the spirit
[26:39] of adoption whereby we cry
[26:43] ABA Romans 8: 16 the spirit self will
[26:50] bear witness with the spirit that we are
[26:53] the children of
[26:55] God for I reckon that the sufferings of
[26:59] this present times are not worthy to be
[27:02] compared with the glory which shall be
[27:06] revealed in US Romans
[27:09] 8:8 moreover whom he predestinate then
[27:13] he also called whom he called then he
[27:16] also Justified and whom he justified
[27:20] then he also glorified what shall we say
[27:22] to these things if God be for us who can
[27:26] be against us Ro Romans 8 verse 30 and
[27:33] 31
[27:35] God it's so wonderful God love it's so
[27:42] wonderful God love it's so wonderful God
[27:49] wonderful
[27:51] love so high you can't go over it

[28:38] so can't go under it so wide you can't
[28:44] go around it God's wonderful
[28:56] love
[29:04] God bless you
[29:06] all I want to start this testimony off
[29:08] by
[29:11] saying God is still the god of not only
[29:17] Miracles but as of
[29:20] healing and his promises never
[29:23] fail back in December I went to a
[29:26] specialist to be seen
[29:31] so we could get some
[29:34] answers funny enough it was actually the
[29:37] specialist brother Fabio went to
[29:42] see after talking with our pastor we all
[29:45] felt it was the right decision for me to
[29:47] go see
[29:52] him after meeting with the doctor he
[29:55] felt like I have might have an
[29:56] underlying condition
[30:02] condition called Mass Cell Activation
[30:08] Syndrome I had the blood work and test
[30:11] done and was waiting my final
[30:12] appointment to get the
[30:17] results but a few weeks ago I had an
[30:19] episode in
[30:23] church and brother Diego came to pray
[30:26] for me
[30:29] and when he did he said to
[30:32] me sister those Spirits are not in your
[30:35] body anymore you are
[30:39] free at the time I couldn't understand
[30:41] it because I was experiencing
[30:46] symptoms but I just clung on to that
[30:50] promise as the weeks went by and things
[30:53] got
[30:56] worse
[30:58] I just knew that the darkest hour means
[31:00] Dawn is just in
[31:05] sight last Thursday I had my final
[31:11] appointment and when the doctor was
[31:13] going over the results he looked
[31:18] puzzled and I knew it could be either
[31:20] really good or really bad
[31:24] news he looked up and said it's seems as
[31:27] though your blood your blood work came
[31:29] back perfect and all your tests are
[31:33] [Applause]
[31:36] negative I looked up at my parents and
[31:39] they both
[31:43] smiled he then began to say how
[31:45] sometimes the tests don't always show
[31:47] the results
[31:53] correctly but after the meeting ended my
[31:56] dad looked at me and and said the Lord
[31:57] is showing you that through your blood
[32:04] work his promise and what brother Diego
[32:06] said was the
[32:09] truth and you are
[32:12] healed I believe the lord gave me a
[32:14] double
[32:16] portion by not only the healing
[32:21] process but a miracle as
[32:25] well and although this symptoms keep
[32:27] trying to harm my
[32:31] body I am standing here to
[32:35] say that God has and will finish the
[32:40] work and I am fully without a doubt
[32:43] healed in Jesus
[32:46] name I just want to thank everyone who
[32:49] has prayed with me and fought with
[32:54] me I wouldn't be standing here today
[32:57] without all of
[33:00] you I love you all very
[33:03] much this song is my testimony and I

[44:09] parable those of you that the last
[44:11] message that I
[44:13] spoke there there was uh I I mentioned
[44:16] it briefly on a
[44:19] parable but um but the Lord kept
[44:22] bringing this to me and I and I feel led
[44:25] to to go into this a little
[44:29] more we're happy to to have the visitors
[44:32] that are here brother God bless
[44:34] you my my Primos David sister Kathy God

[44:50] matters
[44:51] amen amen so we're we're grateful to God
[44:54] and and so well let's get right into it
[44:58] right why wait let's let's jump in now
[45:01] and uh you can be so kind to turn in
[45:03] your Bibles to the book of St Matthew
[45:06] the 13th
[45:09] chapter and verse 10 and 11 here Jesus
[45:12] is speaking to the
[45:16] multitude when you have it you can say
[45:19] Amen am amen it reads like this there's
[45:24] a few few pages still going so we'll
[45:26] we'll let you find
[45:28] it we want everybody to to eat this
[45:32] morning amen reads like this and the
[45:35] disciples came and said unto him why
[45:38] speakest thou unto them in
[45:44] Parables he answered and said unto them
[45:47] because it is given unto you I I I I
[45:51] want you to know if you can put your
[45:52] name there this
[45:54] morning because it is is given unto
[45:58] Caleb now I want we're going to read it
[46:01] again but put your name
[46:03] there because he says it is given unto
[46:08] Caleb I'm going to say it again let's
[46:10] put our names there one more time
[46:13] because it is given unto
[46:15] Caleb to know the mysteries of the
[46:19] kingdom of
[46:23] heaven but to them it is not
[46:27] given one more scripture Mark the 4th
[46:33] chapter and verse 33 and
[46:43] 34 remember why do you speak in
[46:48] parables in verse 33 says and with many
[46:51] such Parables spake he the word unto
[46:54] them as they they were able to hear
[47:01] it not easy sometimes
[47:04] huh but he spake unto them as they were
[47:07] able to hear
[47:08] it what were they hearing
[47:11] with some people hear with this ear the
[47:15] natural
[47:16] ear but then there are those that that
[47:19] hear with a spiritual
[47:22] ear so once again as they were able to
[47:25] hear it
[47:27] that's how faith comes right
[47:30] right but without a parable spake he not
[47:34] unto
[47:37] them but watch this now and when they
[47:40] were
[47:41] alone he expounded all things to his
[47:47] disciples amen may God had his blessings
[47:49] to the reading of his word you may be
[47:53] seated amen
[47:57] here we have something
[47:59] tremendous the more I look into it the
[48:01] more I can say
[48:03] wow wow Parables I I I I began to see
[48:07] this in a whole different
[48:09] light now if we were to ask you the
[48:12] question real quick
[48:14] Parable once again we should all know
[48:17] the meaning of the word Parable
[48:21] amen can you help me this
[48:24] morning what is the
[48:29] Parable all right so it sounds like a
[48:32] few are giving it their best shot
[48:36] right it is simply an Earthly
[48:40] story with a Heavenly
[48:43] meaning okay now now now keep that in
[48:46] mind as we go through this
[48:49] message it also means when you place One
[48:53] Thing by the side of another thing
[48:58] it's to compare one thing with
[49:01] another a parable deals with the
[49:04] likeness and the
[49:09] similitude if I were to ask then the
[49:11] question what is the purpose of the
[49:15] parable Jesus could have preached many
[49:18] different
[49:20] ways he could have he could have
[49:22] expounded in different
[49:24] ways there are many different kind of
[49:28] teachings or ways to
[49:30] teach but if you notice here Jesus chose
[49:33] to speak to the people with
[49:37] Parables and and it's not by coincidence
[49:39] that he speaks by a
[49:42] parable there there's something that a
[49:45] parable
[49:47] does and that is that it brings the
[49:49] natural and the spiritual
[49:53] together you know sometimes as human
[49:56] beings we're we we're very carnal in a
[49:58] lot of
[50:00] ways so many times we see things and and
[50:02] every time we look at things it seems
[50:04] like we're always looking at it in a in
[50:06] a natural or carnal
[50:10] way am I talking to anyone this
[50:13] morning we look at things and why am I
[50:18] sick this happen to me why am I going
[50:22] through
[50:23] this but we never look any farther other
[50:25] than what our five senses tell
[50:30] us we don't seem to want to really
[50:32] search out the spiritual aspect of
[50:36] it and so we go through life and we're
[50:39] down in the dumps because things just
[50:41] don't go our
[50:44] way but once again Jesus spoke in
[50:49] Parables the purpose once again is that
[50:52] he would to he was going to bring the
[50:54] the natural and the spiritual
[50:58] together and that's what we're after
[51:00] this
[51:01] morning we're after going beyond our
[51:04] five
[51:06] senses and we're after going to things
[51:08] that really matter and that is bringing
[51:10] them
[51:13] together how many would like to bring
[51:15] the natural and the spiritual together
[51:17] this
[51:18] morning I believe that we're here for
[51:20] that very
[51:22] reason we hear many times that this
[51:26] saying well the natural types the
[51:31] spiritual and it is true when you put
[51:33] the natural and the spiritual
[51:37] together it's like putting a your your
[51:40] left hand and your right hand
[51:43] together although they they are they are
[51:46] different in one
[51:48] sense but when you bring them together
[51:50] it's it's like a mirror image of of each
[51:52] other
[51:54] right
[51:56] it's like a mirror you see them and they
[51:58] they fit perfectly
[52:00] together now now when we see this
[52:02] natural type in the
[52:06] spiritual I started out my message in
[52:10] Poland and I asked simply the
[52:13] question the same question that I have
[52:15] asked here that I asked here not long
[52:19] ago and that was how many of you are
[52:23] perfect so if I were to ask you again
[52:25] this morning how many perfect people do
[52:27] we
[52:43] have locked on right now how many
[52:47] perfect people do we
[52:51] have about half the church is
[52:54] perfect
[52:56] it's like that everywhere we
[52:58] go it doesn't matter what church I go
[53:01] to I ask the same
[53:04] question I get the same answer all the
[53:08] time the answer is dear in the
[53:19] headlights once again how many perfect
[53:21] people do we have
[53:24] here
[53:29] I'm trying to get going in my message
[53:30] but I but I can't get over this this
[53:32] this question is a good
[53:36] one it's the same response everywhere we
[53:40] go and the majority can't respond right
[53:43] away because as soon as you ask the
[53:47] question you see the face
[53:50] change and you see the wheels start
[53:54] turning
[53:56] no this week this happened and I T this
[53:59] and I said this and I did this and we
[54:02] can't figure out how we can be
[54:05] perfect all right now you see this
[54:08] because it it's
[54:10] important that if you don't understand
[54:13] the
[54:14] parable you'll never be able to say I am
[54:18] perfect impossible why because you can't
[54:22] bring the spiritual and the natural
[54:27] together come on now this is this is the
[54:29] problem because when all we see is our
[54:32] natural physical
[54:35] condition we cannot under that
[54:38] understand how we can be
[54:42] perfect this is is very
[54:46] important since the
[54:49] world likes to
[54:52] say no one is perfect
[54:56] how many of you have ever used that
[55:00] phrase I've said this to you so I'm
[55:02] going to say it again
[55:04] though well Nobody's
[55:07] Perfect the only one that says that are
[55:11] the ones that got
[55:13] caught right you don't ever hear that
[55:15] from people that didn't get
[55:18] caught when they when they get caught
[55:20] with their hand in the cookie
[55:23] jar well is
[55:26] perfect right now now now this this has
[55:29] to
[55:31] change because we
[55:34] Christians we go along with that
[55:38] saying and we have learned and
[55:40] accustomed
[55:43] ourselves to live a life of
[55:48] imperfection are are you with me we have
[55:51] accustomed
[55:53] ourselves that we're human
[55:55] beings that we just we'll just live a
[55:58] life of
[56:00] imperfection we are living in a prison
[56:03] of
[56:05] imperfection when you look around the
[56:07] people are in prisons of
[56:10] imperfection because everybody or nobody
[56:14] is
[56:15] perfect church let me tell you this
[56:18] morning that we have a perfect
[56:22] sacrifice we serve a perfect perect
[56:26] God and we come from a perfect
[56:30] logos then how in the world are we not
[56:35] perfect if we're trying to perfect this
[56:40] guy we're never going to do it but there
[56:44] is a man on the
[56:46] inside there is a man on the
[56:49] inside who through the
[56:53] word is
[56:56] perfect now how how many believe
[56:59] that as you ask these
[57:02] questions really it really starts to it
[57:05] gets people
[57:07] thinking we are
[57:09] perfect you know why because we have
[57:13] received the perfect interpretation of
[57:15] the
[57:17] word our founding Pastor said
[57:20] this we are
[57:22] perfect when the perfect interpretation
[57:26] of the
[57:28] word has been interpreted to our
[57:32] conscience My Oh my he that hath an ear
[57:35] let him
[57:37] hear now now this is is where we
[57:41] start what was the purpose of of using a
[57:44] parable to begin
[57:47] with it helps us it helps us in so many
[57:51] different
[57:53] ways a parable helps us
[58:00] realize that though we live under the
[58:06] tension the
[58:09] nervousness the pressures of this
[58:13] age and we are born with the breakable
[58:16] and fallible
[58:20] nature we still have the
[58:23] capacity
[58:25] to hold the divine within
[58:30] ourselves did you get that church we
[58:33] live in a world of
[58:35] tension we live in a world of
[58:38] nervousness but through even a falling
[58:42] condition God has made a
[58:45] way he made a way for every one of us
[58:48] that's here
[58:49] today to do what to to
[58:52] realize that we are to hold the Divine
[58:56] inside of
[58:58] us I don't know if that excites you but
[59:00] it excites me this
[59:02] morning that Divine would come and dwell
[59:06] in the
[59:08] hearts of mortal men and women
[59:13] like only through a new birth can we
[59:16] accomplish these
[59:19] things natural does type the
[59:23] spiritual
[59:25] natural is the Earthly
[59:28] story I want you to tell your neighbor
[59:31] neighbor the
[59:35] natural the
[59:37] natural is the Earthly
[59:42] story but there's more to it than
[59:44] that all right because the
[59:48] spiritual is the Heavenly
[59:51] meaning once again parable
[59:55] is an Earthly
[59:57] story with a Heavenly
[1:00:00] meaning now how many natural people do
[1:00:02] we have
[1:00:04] here well we're all we all should be we
[1:00:07] all we're all natural right we're all
[1:00:09] physical fles and
[1:00:11] blood how many of you have an Earthly
[1:00:16] story I have an Earthly
[1:00:19] story but how many of you have
[1:00:23] realized the Heavenly meaning of your
[1:00:29] story uhoh that's another thing
[1:00:32] now once again the natural types the
[1:00:37] spiritual our
[1:00:39] lives every
[1:00:41] event has already happened in the
[1:00:49] spiritual yes or yes I'm say again every
[1:00:53] event everything in our lives has
[1:00:56] already happened in the
[1:01:02] spiritual but we need
[1:01:06] something to understand the meaning of
[1:01:10] it we all come from different walks of
[1:01:12] life
[1:01:15] amen we've all been through hardships in
[1:01:18] our
[1:01:19] life one or the other there is not
[1:01:23] anyone that that is Bor
[1:01:25] born that has not seen
[1:01:28] trouble the Bible tells you that man
[1:01:31] that is born of a woman few
[1:01:34] days and full of
[1:01:36] trouble all right troubles everywhere we
[1:01:40] turn but if we never understand the
[1:01:43] spiritual
[1:01:46] meaning then they have not come
[1:01:49] together we don't know the
[1:01:52] parable here Jesus is saying learn a
[1:01:56] parable tell your neighbor neighbor
[1:01:58] learn a
[1:02:01] parable that's tremendous because we're
[1:02:03] going to need this in the
[1:02:05] message learn a parable because the
[1:02:09] parable puts them
[1:02:11] together Church there is so much that is
[1:02:14] going on right
[1:02:16] now I pray that our eyes and our ears
[1:02:19] are open to
[1:02:21] it when we see these things happen
[1:02:24] happening everywhere we
[1:02:26] turn you see the good the bad the
[1:02:31] ugly all kinds of things going
[1:02:34] on but we also understand that there is
[1:02:39] something that are five senses cannot
[1:02:41] pick
[1:02:44] up it can only be picked up by our six
[1:02:47] sense which is
[1:02:50] Faith and Faith being the six sense
[1:02:55] it will declare what the other five
[1:02:57] senses cannot
[1:03:01] declare Hebrews 111 and3 simply tells
[1:03:06] us now Faith is the substance of things
[1:03:09] hoped
[1:03:12] for it is the evidence of things not
[1:03:16] seen through faith we
[1:03:20] understand that the worlds were framed
[1:03:23] by the word of God
[1:03:28] so that the things which are
[1:03:30] seen were not made of things which do
[1:03:35] appear in other words things that we
[1:03:38] see were made of things that we we
[1:03:42] cannot
[1:03:44] see these things came from
[1:03:48] somewhere out of
[1:03:50] nothing he made
[1:03:53] something
[1:03:54] I remember that story and we all know it
[1:03:57] very
[1:03:58] well of the scientist that challenge
[1:04:02] God says we can make and create what you
[1:04:07] do everybody remember the story
[1:04:10] right and so he said well go
[1:04:12] ahead so the scientist goes and he grabs
[1:04:15] a handful of
[1:04:18] dirt the Lord says put that
[1:04:21] down get your own dirt
[1:04:25] yeah yeah that's right because it
[1:04:27] came by the power of the spoken
[1:04:32] word
[1:04:33] existence from what seemed to be
[1:04:37] nothing yet there was something there
[1:04:40] was Elohim there he was by
[1:04:43] himself but from himself he created or
[1:04:47] brought these
[1:04:49] things that's what creation is all about
[1:04:52] listen closely it brings the Unseen of
[1:04:56] the spiritual
[1:04:58] world into the natural or Physical
[1:05:02] Realm okay did you get that I'm GNA say
[1:05:06] it again because you got to get all
[1:05:09] these pieces of the
[1:05:12] puzzle creation is all
[1:05:14] about this is why Satan cannot
[1:05:18] create how many know that Satan cannot
[1:05:21] create only can pervert or take what God
[1:05:24] has already
[1:05:26] created
[1:05:28] creation brings the Unseen spiritual
[1:05:33] world and it brings it into the natural
[1:05:36] or visible
[1:05:39] World
[1:05:41] Parables use the visible
[1:05:44] world to illustrate what's going on in
[1:05:47] the spiritual
[1:05:49] realm now we know how important a
[1:05:52] parable is I'm get it learn
[1:05:58] Parable all right when we know the
[1:06:01] Earthly
[1:06:04] story problem is that we miss
[1:06:10] details I don't know why this is
[1:06:13] happening you're missing
[1:06:15] details I don't know why I got to go
[1:06:18] through
[1:06:19] this missing details of the
[1:06:23] parable the parable
[1:06:25] comes to show the
[1:06:31] details this is important
[1:06:33] church because if not the enemy puts his
[1:06:36] finger in your mouth and does with you
[1:06:38] whatever he
[1:06:40] wants yes or yes amen the enemy comes
[1:06:44] and the next thing you know it I don't
[1:06:46] know I don't know why I'm in this this
[1:06:50] condition learn a
[1:06:52] parable telling us learn a parable tell
[1:06:55] your neighbor again learn a parable
[1:06:58] neighbor important to see this now we
[1:07:02] missed
[1:07:04] details and things happen to us and our
[1:07:08] family and why do we
[1:07:10] do we shut
[1:07:16] down all of a sudden we don't feel like
[1:07:19] going to
[1:07:21] church but I'm going through I don't
[1:07:24] know I don't know why why we did we did
[1:07:28] why why is it always the the negative
[1:07:29] part of
[1:07:31] it always why why
[1:07:34] why but but how many times do we seek
[1:07:37] the the spiritual meaning of what's
[1:07:39] going
[1:07:41] on this is what I'm after this morning
[1:07:45] there's a spiritual meaning of why
[1:07:47] you're going through what you're going
[1:07:50] through why are we not seeking those
[1:07:52] things
[1:07:54] because the devil he got there
[1:07:57] first he got to your mind first and said
[1:08:01] poor look at
[1:08:03] you let me stop for a moment
[1:08:06] here when I when we were in
[1:08:08] Poland I we we had a prayer
[1:08:12] line it probably to this day is probably
[1:08:15] the the most powerful prayer line I've
[1:08:18] ever
[1:08:20] been those people when they pray they
[1:08:22] are so sinc
[1:08:27] and when they pray that they don't
[1:08:30] just no no no they they they pray out
[1:08:32] loud
[1:08:34] everybody women children when you say
[1:08:38] let's pray and they all began to raise
[1:08:41] their voices and they began to
[1:08:43] pray you talk about about getting the
[1:08:46] spiritual world and and bringing it to
[1:08:48] the Natural
[1:08:51] World they bring him on the scene
[1:08:54] they're not afraid to cry out to the
[1:08:57] Lord as as the the line was going
[1:09:00] through people going through the
[1:09:02] line I noticed a young
[1:09:05] man this young man was probably in I
[1:09:07] don't know early early 20s or
[1:09:12] so and I noticed that he went around and
[1:09:15] he and he came back through the line
[1:09:19] again after the
[1:09:21] service his mother asked if he if she
[1:09:24] and and her son which was that young man
[1:09:26] could could speak to
[1:09:29] me very all handsome young
[1:09:33] man seem seemingly
[1:09:37] normal but he had a story to
[1:09:41] tell and I stood there listening to his
[1:09:46] story he says that that he had a lot of
[1:09:49] things going for
[1:09:50] him very athletic young man
[1:09:55] but five years
[1:09:57] before he was in a horrendous car
[1:10:02] accident he was thrown from the rear
[1:10:04] glass of the of his
[1:10:08] vehicle it broke his
[1:10:12] spine when you think you have it
[1:10:15] back somebody else is going do

[1:10:31] man and he's coming and and to that I
[1:10:36] believe it was his fiveyear anniversary
[1:10:38] of the
[1:10:40] accident he comes and and and he begins
[1:10:42] to to to put out what's in his
[1:10:47] heart he said I fought hard and with the
[1:10:49] help of
[1:10:51] God I overcame all the odds
[1:10:55] and I had to learn how to walk
[1:10:58] again I had to learn how to talk and I
[1:11:00] had to learn how to do all these things
[1:11:03] again he said but
[1:11:05] brother I still struggle
[1:11:08] today I said what's your
[1:11:11] struggle he said that Spirit of
[1:11:15] depression hits me every day and I can
[1:11:19] be doing good and the spirit of
[1:11:22] depression comes upon me
[1:11:25] and tells me you've lost five
[1:11:28] years you'll never get him
[1:11:30] back he said and I go down into the
[1:11:34] dumps what do you tell a young man who
[1:11:37] in the prime of his life has gone
[1:11:39] through
[1:11:41] that what do you tell
[1:11:43] him I'll pray for
[1:11:46] you but he wanted an
[1:11:49] answer the Lord had been dealing with me
[1:11:51] in this
[1:11:52] parable
[1:11:54] and I want you all to to listen
[1:11:56] closely because this is this is where we
[1:11:59] all find
[1:12:00] ourselves in the
[1:12:03] parable Earthly
[1:12:06] story Heavenly
[1:12:08] meaning I looked at the young man and I
[1:12:11] could feel the presence of the Lord
[1:12:14] come learn a
[1:12:16] parable learn a
[1:12:18] parable I said I said
[1:12:21] brother I said the Lord wants you to
[1:12:23] learn the
[1:12:28] parable I can't tell you the
[1:12:31] mystery because the mystery is for you
[1:12:33] to find
[1:12:35] out God for that but you can find the
[1:12:40] Myster hid inside the
[1:12:43] parable that's the day that you're free
[1:12:45] from
[1:12:46] that day you will not be depressed no
[1:12:49] more I said find the purpose in the

[1:13:03] help

[1:13:09] through there's a purpose behind
[1:13:12] it and the purpose is so that you can
[1:13:15] tell your
[1:13:18] generation that Jesus Christ is

[1:13:35] more years
[1:13:37] left but he's not done with you and if
[1:13:41] he's not done with you then there's a
[1:13:43] reason why you're still

[1:27:38] sees it a different way they're still my
[1:27:43] brothers different I still got to love
[1:27:48] them we get so caught up in so many
[1:27:51] things
[1:27:52] but when they saw a body working
[1:27:57] together come on you know what I'm
[1:27:59] talking about when they see a body
[1:28:00] working a team working
[1:28:04] together they said wow on Wow one
[1:28:08] brother after
[1:28:10] another can this happen in our
[1:28:13] country that's the
[1:28:16] questions well others are thinking what
[1:28:18] can I buy
[1:28:20] now I'm shopping and I'm going to do
[1:28:23] this there are thousands upon thousands
[1:28:26] upon millions of people
[1:28:31] dying what are we
[1:28:34] doing come on now learn a
[1:28:37] parable learn a parable what he is doing
[1:28:41] today Dr Locker States
[1:28:45] this in a
[1:28:48] parable and images borrowed from the
[1:28:51] visible world
[1:28:56] and is accompanied by a
[1:28:59] truth there is a truth that accompanies
[1:29:02] every believer that comes to
[1:29:06] Earth it's accomp they are accompanied
[1:29:09] by a
[1:29:11] truth from the invisible or spiritual
[1:29:17] world come by yourself it's not this is
[1:29:20] not some accident that happened
[1:29:24] are you with me this is not some
[1:29:26] accident truth accompanies
[1:29:31] you what is that
[1:29:35] truth your
[1:29:37] Parable is accompanied by a
[1:29:41] truth from the
[1:29:45] invisible do you know why Jesus chose to
[1:29:48] use
[1:29:50] Parables because he knew
[1:29:53] that the
[1:29:55] imagination is quicker than
[1:29:59] [Music]
[1:30:01] logic oh I'm going to say that again
[1:30:04] Jesus used
[1:30:08] Parable because it activates the
[1:30:12] imagination
[1:30:16] instantly and that was his way of
[1:30:19] getting to you before the enemy does
[1:30:24] because if the enemy can use make you
[1:30:26] use
[1:30:30] logic then he's got
[1:30:33] you well I know that but what about this
[1:30:38] and this and
[1:30:41] this where we miss it we use logic more
[1:30:43] than we do Faith before logic
[1:30:47] starts logic is
[1:30:50] okay but it gets in Faith's
[1:30:54] way because you try to figure everything
[1:30:58] out why
[1:31:00] this don't worry about
[1:31:03] why learn a
[1:31:08] parable we are too carnal
[1:31:11] sometimes learn a
[1:31:13] parable BR the spiritual in the
[1:31:17] natural still with
[1:31:19] me let's let's go for just a little
[1:31:22] while just a little bit more okay now
[1:31:25] now
[1:31:26] Parables they help with the
[1:31:30] memory you ever noticed that in your
[1:31:33] life the brother could preach up a
[1:31:37] storm then run down the
[1:31:40] aisles and you'll say man that was a
[1:31:42] good sermon that was a great
[1:31:47] service by Monday
[1:31:50] afternoon you don't even remember his
[1:31:53] the scripture he
[1:31:56] used you don't even remember what he
[1:31:58] would preached about but if he tells you
[1:32:01] a story or a parable that sticks to you
[1:32:06] what a beautiful story that brother I
[1:32:08] love that
[1:32:11] story this is why parables are so
[1:32:15] important they help with the
[1:32:18] memory and they stir up or excite the
[1:32:24] affections and they awaken your
[1:32:29] conscience learn a
[1:32:32] parable let it wake you
[1:32:34] up Parables
[1:32:36] then used by
[1:32:39] Jesus as the
[1:32:42] vehicle for the highest truths of
[1:32:46] all it was divine
[1:32:49] truth clothed in human
[1:32:57] gar right amen that's why Parables
[1:33:00] listen
[1:33:01] closely
[1:33:03] Parables come with a
[1:33:10] power parable of the
[1:33:12] S parable of the prodical son parable of
[1:33:16] the 10 virgins Parable Parable Parable
[1:33:20] parable but when you find out the
[1:33:25] mystery in the
[1:33:27] parable and it brings the spiritual and
[1:33:30] the natural
[1:33:32] together there is a power in that
[1:33:36] Parable say again there is a power in
[1:33:39] that
[1:33:41] Parable enough to set you
[1:33:44] free to bring you to who you really
[1:33:50] are Parables have the power listen to
[1:33:55] this they have the
[1:33:57] power to bring the natural and the
[1:34:00] spiritual
[1:34:02] world into
[1:34:06] harmony why do you think the prophet of
[1:34:10] God why do you think that he could live
[1:34:13] in Two Worlds at the same
[1:34:17] time how is that
[1:34:19] possible he learned the parable
[1:34:26] learn a
[1:34:27] parable because that's what brings
[1:34:29] Harmony in your
[1:34:32] life as I'm preaching now I I'm acting
[1:34:37] out I'm acting out right now in the
[1:34:40] natural what has already gone on in the
[1:34:45] spiritual right yes or yes see see how
[1:34:49] is it possible that I can be in Poland
[1:34:53] and the Lord using Brother Diego to say
[1:34:56] what you what is going to happen
[1:34:57] tomorrow has already
[1:34:59] [Music]
[1:35:01] happened to the untrained
[1:35:04] person how did it already happen it
[1:35:07] already happened in the
[1:35:10] spiritual then we see it happen or
[1:35:13] unfold in the
[1:35:14] natural W what a tremendous

[1:35:47] parable unfolds itself through the
[1:35:50] actors
[1:35:53] am it needs the human
[1:35:57] Garb natural
[1:36:00] man witness be an
[1:36:03] actor
[1:36:05] spiritual have its way through the
[1:36:10] natural you with me you believe that

[1:36:36] parable it's got to come into
[1:36:39] harmony watch the parable
[1:36:42] now and as the Lord leads us in in in

[1:36:46] messages but in the first SE brother
[1:36:48] Bram says
[1:36:50] this act
[1:36:53] tonight Satan changing his mask all the
[1:36:58] actors acting the part that he
[1:37:02] did when he become from a spirit to a
[1:37:07] man he only put on an actor's
[1:37:12] garment or human
[1:37:15] flesh now you see it's only an actor's
[1:37:20] form
[1:37:22] that's the
[1:37:23] reason they are all in
[1:37:27] Parables the whole book of Revelations
[1:37:30] is
[1:37:32] symbols and those
[1:37:35] symbols are
[1:37:38] Parables is that what he said oh that's
[1:37:41] why we see in
[1:37:43] Parables the way they are here beasts
[1:37:46] and animals and so
[1:37:49] forth it's in an act
[1:37:52] and these actors began in the first
[1:37:53] church
[1:37:55] age because it was Christ revealing
[1:37:58] himself to the seven Church
[1:38:03] ages through these Church
[1:38:06] ages there's a great mess up comes
[1:38:09] along then at the end of the church
[1:38:13] ages the seventh Angel's
[1:38:18] message is to pick up these lost
[1:38:23] Mysteries where are they
[1:38:27] lost where is he going to pick up these
[1:38:30] mysteries
[1:38:32] from learn a
[1:38:34] parable the parable hides the
[1:38:38] mystery and the only thing that could

[1:38:43] us was the message of the seventh
[1:38:47] angel nothing else nothing else the
[1:38:50] seventh Angel's
[1:38:52] message is to pick up these lost
[1:38:56] Mysteries and to give it to the
[1:38:58] church now will notice
[1:39:02] that here he picks it up he puts it all
[1:39:06] together then he brings the
[1:39:10] parable watch now the we're coming into
[1:39:13] a parable in our
[1:39:15] time Jesus said all these
[1:39:19] Parables without a parable he spake
[1:39:22] not so if he did not speak without
[1:39:25] parables in that
[1:39:27] time how would he speak without a
[1:39:29] parable in this
[1:39:32] time when he's the same yesterday today
[1:39:35] and
[1:39:37] forever he's still speaking Parables
[1:39:41] today people are still saying we don't
[1:39:45] understand what did he

[1:41:10] parable right amen but there's more to
[1:41:13] it something happened
[1:41:16] today the message is
[1:41:19] here to today is the
[1:41:22] scene today is the part of the
[1:41:26] actors acting out the
[1:41:29] part where is he getting his
[1:41:33] part in the
[1:41:37] parable that's
[1:41:39] right cuz it's not in holy
[1:41:44] script well I look I I read and I don't
[1:41:47] find it you got to do more than just
[1:41:50] read
[1:41:52] got to make contact with the
[1:41:55] spiritual yes or
[1:41:58] yes it's not in holy
[1:42:01] script you're not going to read in the
[1:42:04] Bible a team from Cedar Hills Church of
[1:42:07] the Cross went to Poland
[1:42:11] that it's
[1:42:14] Unwritten you won't find it in the
[1:42:16] Bible yet you
[1:42:19] will
[1:42:23] it doesn't say your name either that oh
[1:42:26] brother Reuben will be
[1:42:29] saved me is it in
[1:42:33] here does it say Reuben's gonna be
[1:42:36] saved but it doesn't say it the way we
[1:42:39] look for
[1:42:40] it a parable and the parable is
[1:42:44] whosoever
[1:42:46] will that means
[1:42:48] Caleb I don't know about you but the put
[1:42:50] my name there that means Caleb whosoever
[1:42:54] will let him
[1:42:56] come God so loved

[1:43:02] parable Hallelujah pray you're getting
[1:43:04] it this morning Hallelujah watch now it
[1:43:07] doesn't say we went to Africa
[1:43:09] either but it does say go ye into all
[1:43:14] the
[1:43:15] world and preach the
[1:43:17] gospel now there's where I find myself
[1:43:21] the parable BR harmony with the natural
[1:43:26] and the
[1:43:27] spiritual when they come together there
[1:43:30] is a
[1:43:31] blast there's an explosion that

[1:46:52] natural or an Earthly message or or or
[1:46:55] or
[1:46:56] story with a Heavenly
[1:46:59] meaning

[1:48:33] fulfilled Heaven and Earth shall pass
[1:48:36] away but my word will not pass
[1:48:40] away it's not by chance or
[1:48:43] coincidence that God allowed us on this
[1:48:47] trip to go to
[1:48:49] owitz oh my anybody here ever have gone
[1:48:53] to aich
[1:48:54] before
[1:48:56] anybody that's you you you that know
[1:48:59] history a little
[1:49:00] bit this is where the they had one of
[1:49:03] the largest concentration camps for the
[1:49:09] Jews during the time of the second world
[1:49:13] war around there was around 3.3 million
[1:49:17] people living or Jews living in in
[1:49:19] Poland
[1:49:23] close to three million of them were
[1:49:29] killed to go into those gas
[1:49:34] chainers Brother Carlos you remember
[1:49:36] when we went to that in in in uh in
[1:49:39] Jerusalem we went to the to the uh the
[1:49:42] Holocaust
[1:49:45] Museum there are things that I I don't I
[1:49:49] would wouldn't care if I went back
[1:49:53] again and you see the pictures there and
[1:49:55] you see the different things but when
[1:49:57] you walk in to the actual
[1:50:00] camp and you feel the
[1:50:03] heaviness all that went that went on
[1:50:06] there and then you hear the voice say
[1:50:08] again learn a parable of the
[1:50:13] Victory and I'm saying Lord what did I
[1:50:16] miss he took us there for a
[1:50:19] reason into the gas
[1:50:21] Chambers
[1:50:23] Crums and then you go and you and you
[1:50:25] see piles and piles of shoes and and and
[1:50:29] their literal
[1:50:32] hair you go to where they where they
[1:50:35] would shoot
[1:50:36] them and and the heaviness that's there
[1:50:39] and
[1:50:40] you see scripture
[1:50:43] again the souls under the altar when the
[1:50:47] fif SE was opened the fifth
[1:50:51] was open there was Souls under the
[1:50:54] altar that were crying Lord how
[1:50:57] long before you avenge us of our blood
[1:51:01] Lord they killed us Lord when are you
[1:51:03] going to avenge
[1:51:04] us and and you go through all
[1:51:07] this and through it all we went for this
[1:51:11] purpose they are
[1:51:14] respects those that
[1:51:17] died but you see those things
[1:51:20] it causes you to ask the
[1:51:23] question did I catch all the all the
[1:51:27] pieces of the of this of this
[1:51:34] Parable natural Israel typifies the
[1:51:38] spiritual
[1:51:40] church have I caught all the
[1:51:43] details learn this Parable he say you
[1:51:46] can't even go into the seventh seal you
[1:51:48] have learned the parable of the Fig
[1:51:52] Tree the lies in
[1:51:55] there church I'm going to say it again
[1:51:57] the mystery lies in the
[1:52:01] parable go back and hear this message
[1:52:04] again he I there's so much
[1:52:08] here all those Jews were they were
[1:52:12] killed and though they had not
[1:52:15] accepted Jesus Christ the atonement
[1:52:18] yet because they were blinded for our
[1:52:23] sake but yet they will be given white
[1:52:27] robes brother bradam says mine were not
[1:52:30] under that
[1:52:33] altar mine were other under another
[1:52:37] altar he said mine already had white
[1:52:41] robes because they're the ones that
[1:52:44] listen and came forth from the
[1:52:47] message they have already put white
[1:52:50] robes but these
[1:52:52] Jews not
[1:52:54] until they come and they
[1:52:58] Avenged
[1:53:00] not will they be given white
[1:53:03] robes this is important to understand

[1:53:09] parable he's dealing with
[1:53:13] Israel is he
[1:53:18] see
[1:53:22] I'm going to say it again is he dealing
[1:53:24] with
[1:53:26] Israel we can say yes and no right now
[1:53:29] in reality he's not dealing with him
[1:53:32] totally because he's he was dealing with
[1:53:35] the church
[1:53:37] agent but now he's not even dealing with
[1:53:39] the church
[1:53:43] AG I'm going to say it
[1:53:46] again oh the seventh Church age
