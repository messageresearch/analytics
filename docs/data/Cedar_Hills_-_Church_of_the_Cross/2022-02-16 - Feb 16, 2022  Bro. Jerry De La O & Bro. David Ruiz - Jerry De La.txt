always a special prayer for our founding pastor amen amen and you may be seated this time i'm asked sister if you would come and give your testimony just quickly when i say i'm something like so i tested her because i have kobe test at home right now okay let's go to the doctor and i called one of the sisters who went out to lunch with her [Music] so i went to the urgent care and i told her just wait here and they said what can i see her here and no doctor is going to say you have to take it to the hospital [Music] you know when you're a nurse you take care of a hundred thousand people through your three years and you can assist a doctor to see your own child they you know you probably will understand my feeling so i went home and i told you the worst you feel then you come you have to say by his wounds i'm healed so she obviously didn't have a doctor because i didn't change her from pediatrician doctor so she didn't have a doctor anyway so i went to the restroom without her knowing uh and i said satan enough is enough and i saw bradbury evie and that's dream he just said to me to read i have i've instructed you so that came right into my mind yes so and throwing me mentally just the power came to me angry at the devil has no right to put his hands over any of us and um so when i review can i say my daughter is the child of the almighty god and so am i i felt something in my back like a snake coming in between my skin going like that and then you come out of my body right now i was in sick my daughter next day was hill and uh of course i have a friend doctor she said maria you come anytime and so i call her and she prescribes someone to my house i think sister lauren i should pay for antibiotics is because sometimes just because sometimes you we don't know what's going on but uh but i i'm so thankful to the lord that he answered prayers and i feel so strongly that i'm not alone and i feel like we are not alone we just need to see with your eyes of faith and this is for the honor and the glory of my all my jesus christ [Applause] man let's all stand we have come to the most important part of the service and that's to hear god's word amen at this time with we're going to be introducing our brother jerry dello and our brother david reese amen that song amazing grace [Music] amazing grace [Music] always be my son a praise [Music] for it was grace [Music] i do not know [Music] just why he came to love me so but he looked beyond all my faults and he saw my knees [Music] to view the cross where jesus died for me [Music] oh [Music] all the time god bless you this evening you're nice to see all your wonderful faces thank the pastor for the confidence in me to speak the word this evening kind of interesting how this came about is [Music] i guess i try to get out of it but but whatever the lord wants we we can't escape it whatever the lord wants not what i want what god wants amen we open our scripture real quick 36 and when i want to start with verse 26 and it says a new heart also will i give you and a new spirit will i put within you and i will take away the stony heart out of your flesh and i will give you a and heart of flesh [Music] on i will put my spirit within you and cause you to walk in my statutes and ye shall keep my judgments and do them [Music] may god add the blessing to the word of the world you may be seated you know i didn't i didn't really have a thought that that just had a hard time finding the thought i just started looking some of the old old old stuff but i wouldn't call it old but but some of my previous notes that i had it was it was not a schedule and this one really caught my attention because uh how many find it hard sometimes to live a christian life juantos is difficult especially in this day and age especially i mean it's it's the most wickedest age we'll ever live in [Music] there there's just so much going on out there and not i mean for older people younger people everybody in general there's just so much out there i thought but sometimes we find it hard right to live a christian life this is difficult you know and and um you know what one of the things you know you we must first do if we want the new birth we we must repent right and and repent probably everybody knows what repent means right you know i ask god for forgiveness of your sins and of course you got to confess your sins and you got to say you know forgive me lord i'm sorry [Music] but also to repent is you got to have a change of mind it's got to be a whole change of thought mind the demo chose the hair el diablo but god chose the heart so your mind is in your heart you do a lot of your thinking from your heart he's got to take out that stony heart because that's tony hart will get you nowhere else now let's not get confused maybe maybe because sometimes we we sometimes we get to this step and we and we get this heart taken out of us and maybe sometimes we confuse that with the holy spirit and maybe that's why we struggle when we get to a certain point and we said well i got a new spirit you know spirit but i got a new spirit what's going on i got a new spirit but brother brown says that that's a new spirit for you and my brother because it's part of the chain it's part of the change that's part of the because if you were to give you the holy spirit right then and there the real spiritual is a moment we can barely put up with ourselves sometimes we can barely put up with one another sometimes we can barely put up with our spouses [Music] bye you know you got repent you know that's a that's one r yes it's not like in like in school you had the three r's right in english [Music] there's a couple of ours in here and one of the r's is replacing replacer we replace the old mindset replacement you know it's it's it's like when when you when you read in uh if you read in a matthew matteo 9 17 mateo nueva de siete since neither do men put new wine into old bottles else the bottles break the rotometer and the rhine run it out vino and both are preserved so what we've got to do is we're getting this new heart servant we get this new heart but we can't put the old stuff back in it has it wasn't necessarily a bottle of water but it but it was made i i believe was made out of goat skins so when you when you put when you put the wine in there it's still in the formation process fermentando so that that bottle or that goat skin is appeal would conform to that wine because there's gases that are still that are still forming yeah and it's still the wine is still in process so when you take out when you empty it out it gets old and cracked because it's conformed to what was already in there before because so in our hearts on what was in there before we came up with an old crackled heart it was full of junk it's full of stuff that shouldn't be in there you know the questions so you would put this new wine in there into this old cracked honest viejo and it wouldn't last very long it would explode you know you know and then the wine would be no good but it's the same with our hearts it's our responsibility and you know somebody told me the other day i hear i hear messages all the time and there's nothing wrong with that there's nothing wrong because i read every day i do this every day but if i'm [Music] and then we wonder why we can't get any farther sometimes we struggle every day i still struggle every day the this evening let me read something in here this is brother branham he said god prophesied through a prophet and said i will write my laws in their heart it's showing that that that would be the dwelling place of god in the human heart amen amen i will write them in my heart in their heart and they'll keep my statutes and so forth saith the lord god said in another place over in ezekiel he said i will i will in that day the hoyo and aquel dia take out your your old fleshy stony heart and i will give you a new spirit there's a new of a spiritual he says a lot of times get mistaken now a lot of people even in pentecostal people a lot of times getting mistaken in that that you you get a new spirit of spiritual he says that's not god's spirit [Applause] run around a little bit and think you got the holy ghost that's not it yes and there's nothing wrong yeah i mean but we're leaving like like we got this new new new spirit in us or this holy spirit in us you know one of my biggest big biggest weaknesses one of my biggest weaknesses that every time the devil wanted to get me to go back and then a little bit of drinking and i struggled with that for years i thought so much that that i was an alcoholic but i i thought i could have one foot in and one foot out when i finally realized i got a new spirit but i didn't get the holy spirit and once the holy spirit comes in when they enter the spirit it'll change everything it'll change your life form of thinking i don't know what time i got here up here but let me finish with this we can go to to uh to romans 12. romanos dosa romans 12 and verse 2. be not conformed to this world but be transformed by the renewing of your mind that you may prove what is that good an acceptable and perfect will of god the westeros intending it's got to be in every single one of us brother branham says yes but what is unrighteousness it's righteousness perverted certainly the devil has a false thing what is it an old fortune teller out on the street a devil possessed person persona cabbages down cabbages on them but when we were when we're taught in the line of the bible then the holy spirit takes its place to santa thomas holy spirit takes it and places it into the church do you see then if you won't accept righteousness then unrighteousness will take over i didn't want to fully accept christ until the world took over i still wanted to do different things i still wanted to hang out with old friends because your old friends want you to do what they're doing now do we have friends of the world yes we are amigos but if christ is in us then we gotta shut the world out of whatever we can pay this world no mind no no you can't go out that door nope the same person you was coming in here you can't be the holy spirit brewing el espirito santo sombra wooing i will take away that stony heart amen god bless [Music] [Applause] hey man can you hear me i mean let's see if i can have each and every one of you stand please go straight into the words we can all open our scriptures open to luke chapter 7 verse starting with verse 36 you know you hear the minister say it it sounds beautiful when you can hear the pages and when you're in the audience and you're the one turning your page [Music] at times it can feel like you're the only one turning your page but what a beautiful sound 7 36 reads like this and one of the pharisees desired him that he would eat with him and he went into the pharisees house and sat down to me [Music] before i get as started and behold a woman in the city which was a sinner when she knew that jesus sat at me in the pharisees house brought an alabaster box of ointment and stood i'm going to just go ahead and read in english to save a little bit of time and stood at his feet behind him weeping and began to wash his feet with tears and did wipe them with the hairs of her head and kissed his feet and anointed them with the ointment now when the pharisee which had bitten him saw it he spake within himself saying this man again you got to catch it's a thought he's thinking to himself this man if he were a prophet would have known who and what manner of woman this is that toucheth him for she is a sinner and you can [Music] and jesus answering said unto him so the previous scripture is this pharisee thought with in himself and jesus being the prophet that he was captures the thoughts and answers openly said unto him simon simon i have somewhat to say unto thee and he say it master there was a certain creditor which had two debtors the one owed 500 pence and the other 50. and when they had nothing to pay he frankly forgave them both tell me therefore which of them will love him most deep while they used answered and said i suppose that he to whom he forgave most and he said unto him thou has rightly judged and he turned to the woman thou this woman i entered into thine house casa thou gave me no water for my feet you know but she hath washed my feet with tears and wiped them with the hairs of her head thou gave me no kiss but this woman since the time i came in hath not ceased to kiss my feet my head with oil they'll dint they'll ditch not anoint but this woman has anointed my feet with ointment no histamise which i know it may not make seem like it makes sense because that's all i could think this doesn't make sense that doesn't go together and i'm going to read this just in english in english and this is talking on the story of samson by the way but the philistines took him and put his and put out his eyes and brought him down to gaza and bound him with fetters of brass and he did grind in the prison house how be it the hair of his head began to grow again after he was shaven then the lords of the philistines gathered them together for to offer a great sacrifice unto dagon their god and to rejoice for they said our god hath delivered samson our enemy into our hand and when the people saw him they praised their god for they said our god hath delivered into our hands our enemy and the destroyer of our country which slew many of us and it came to pass when the hearts when their hearts were married that they said call for samson that he may that he may make a sport and they called for samson out of the prison house and he made them sport and they set him between the pillars and if you interpret me from 26 and samson said unto the lad that held him by the hand suffer me that i may feel the pillars were upon the house standeth that i may lean upon them now the house was full of men and women and all the lords of the philistines were there and they were upon the roof about 3 000 men and women that be held while samson made support and this is the key right here and samson called unto the lord and said oh lord god remember me i pray thee and strengthen me i pray thee only this once oh god that i may that i may be at once avenged the philistines for my two eyes and samson took hold of the two middle pillars upon which the house stood and on which it was born up of the one with his right hand and of the other with his left hand [Music] and samson said let me die with the philistines and he bowed himself with all his might and the house fell upon the lords and upon all the people that were therein so the dead which he slew at his death were more than they which he slew in his life [Music] amen and you may be serious now i want to ask one question concerning the first scripture we read who do you identify with which approach to the lord jesus christ to the lord jesus christ excuse me who i identify with do we identify with the pharisees or do we identify with her or no i remember a certain a certain message that was preached by one of our brothers by brother danny played and it had such an impact on my life when he talked about the good samaritan i don't know if many of you remember it or not no much but jesus in the book of luke pero jesus lucas talks about a certain man going from jerusalem to jericho [Music] and those two did nothing yes that saw and one of the things that struck me in that message is that one time we were all three one time we have we don't want nothing to do with it [Music] at another time maybe we'll check it out and the third person committed completely and so i say that in this regard who do we identify with in this first story have we been coming to church [Music] do i look down upon those at the altar [Music] do i look down at the center los miros pecadores you know one of the observations that i've seen the wrath of the bible is that the lord's people is i read it and i read it and i read it and i hear message after message i come to service i hear sermon after sermon and not at one time have i ever heard a minister say or a tape say or the bible read that the philistines and god's people were friends with you put out his eyes bound him kept him prisoner and then mocked him as they made a great sacrifice to their own [Music] now with the story of samson we have to think about ourselves you take the first story you take the second story and we have to understand it that we are not just one person a person just like the israelites were with the philistines and you can find that in romans chapter 7 if you want to write that down in 1956 on august the 14th brother preaches the message entitled divine love and sovereign grace and he says this now did you realize i have to be able to distinguish this thing are similar to the scriptures we read the my flesh doesn't want to serve the it's like a now i can only speak for myself how many times this is have i failed and as i asked myself again how many times have i failed the lord jesus christ especially when you're honest especially you know i know brother jerry mentioned the the influences and and the old friends you know amigos which prompts me to my next question how many times have i allowed myself to be in the wrong company just like samson is how many times have we allowed ourselves to be in the company estar in the company with the wrong people and he didn't give in right away he didn't give in right away enough and you can go back into judges and you can read the story [Music] but how many times this is the delilah ask him the this is how oh [Music] hey guys what's going on bro why do we allow ourselves to maintain ourselves in that company i'll never forget a message our brother tommy jr preached when he says before me are set two doors but if you want i got some for you too oh you take this i feel undeserving worthless i question everything am i a son of god hanging out with these people children of god don't do this this and that is how many trials one does have we gone through how many temptations have we faced but i want to tell you one thing i want you to understand that it's a test it's a test and in a test now god doesn't tempt man god tries men god keeps his word preaching the same year of 1957 the testing time the testing time come for the lutheran church that you can ever know that you're [Music] that's right don't take nothing less or nothing in the same year brother brandon preaches the message then jesus came in and he stays in paragraph 58 and there's always a testing time every song that cometh to god must first be tested oh i love it oh i don't call for it but after it's passed through the ages went through that testing time we must learn i must learn and we have to make that conscientious decision it is make your confession aggressive breathe out once more because a lot of people will come to church being a legalistic they'll give their life to the lord dance they'll get baptized and then life hits him and then the testing time comes and the doubts come in and the questioning of it am i a son of god how can i be an elected son of god and this is for those who are still hanging out with worldly friends my dad took me aside one [Music] time and i told them what i was doing told them where i was going to be [Music] and i told them about what time i would be home and i was going through a difficult time in my life we've all been there we've all had to pass through the trial and my father told me he goes you know before you go son i want to share something you're a master of the sky i'm sorry you're a master of disguise us uh they think uspinson they think jospiensen that you're one of them want that to sink in and one of these days you know sooner rather than later one of the things that brother jerry struggled with i struggled with as well [Music] i think i would be considered an alcoholic by today's needs [Music] and i see my so-called friends over there um and i had an out-of-body experience i i'm not making this up i promise you no mr inventando and i saw myself sitting on the couch and i saw the people at the table [Music] and then the words played in my mind [Music] i heard i came back you know this morning esta manana i spoke with justin justin and you know we had a conversation about somebody some bibles that we had bought i had bought in a bible he had bought in a bible and we're kind of talking about our bibles right start going about the old wine bags i can't hear you it did it did i'm not lying and then i started talking to brother jerry upstairs about it and he goes bro and in 1957 brother branham priest is entitled the impersonate the impersonation put the new wine in an old bottle pune and it says jesus christ is the same yesterday today and forever the old man will proof the baptism of the holy ghost is just as real today as it ever was poof i don't believe it is [Music] and they that's all there is to it but you get and the word says it's working alive in the heart and it says jesus christ the same yesterday and forever as the wine says jesus is the same yesterday today and forever [Music] not able [Music] as as the pianist comes forward and i was telling justin this and we're kind of going back and forth and i said glory be to god for his word says and i will restore to you the years that the locusts have eaten the cankerworm and the caterpillar and the palmer worm my great army which i sent among you i want to leave you with a piece of advice be sober as you all stand to your feet this is found in first peter the knowing that the same afflictions are accomplished in your brethren that are in the world [Music] [Music] [Music] and you say to yourself i want that i want to be real with god [Music] once [Music] there are ministers here to pray with you and be baptized tonight is your night in are as he is here take him at his word lord jesus we place ourselves in your hands fully consecrated lord we love you and we
