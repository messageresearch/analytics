[36:38] we give you all honor praise
[36:41] gloria
[36:43] his name we ask
[36:44] jesus
[36:45] amen you may be seated
[36:49] amen tonight we're going to
[36:52] talk about financing finances
[37:04] and so i don't know if you recognize
[37:12] but i
[37:13] brought some financial advisors with us
[37:19] okay
[37:22] are you guys ready
[37:24] estan listos hey man can we just get
[37:26] comfortable tonight
[37:30] open up our hearts that the lord could
[37:32] show us
[37:34] and
[37:48] there's still light here for us
[37:52] i want to start off with the scripture
[37:54] book of amos chapter 3.
[38:03] very familiar scripture
[38:07] and it reads like this
[38:10] surely the lord god will do nothing
[38:13] but he revealeth his secret
[38:16] unto his servants the prophets
[38:25] and verse eight
[38:27] the lion hath roared
[38:30] who will not fear
[38:32] the lord god has spoken who can
[38:35] but prophesy
[38:44] now let us go to galatians chapter 5
[38:46] verse 1.
[38:53] and it reads like this
[38:56] stand fast therefore
[38:59] in the liberty
[39:00] wherewith christ
[39:02] have made us free
[39:05] and be not entangled again with the yoke
[39:08] of bondage ah mama
[39:12] that personal feelings
[39:28] many times we look at
[39:30] the chaos of this world
[39:36] and we forget about all
[39:39] that the prophet has left in our hands
[39:46] and many times you know don't
[39:48] misunderstand when we talk about the
[39:50] fear
[39:52] normally
[39:56] the scripture says who can but fear
[40:01] you know but it's because when the word
[40:02] of the prophet comes forth
[40:06] the fear that we need
[40:22] and we began to talk about these
[40:24] subjects
[40:27] if we do not get
[40:29] the
[40:30] biggest part that the prophet left us
[40:53] amen so i want to turn it over to
[40:55] brother carlos and you know
[40:58] carlos and we're going to take it slow
[40:59] tonight
[41:02] so i'm going to ask you for one thing if
[41:04] there's someone here that may not
[41:05] understand something just raise your
[41:07] hand
[41:13] and just as your school teacher would
[41:15] say there's no dumb question come on
[41:23] so i i uh
[41:25] i laughed because a minute ago because
[41:27] the scripture brother ben read i didn't
[41:29] know the scripture that he was going to
[41:30] read i hadn't read it
[41:36] so of course it's it's
[41:38] you're always in amazement how the holy
[41:40] spirit works
[41:43] but what i want to talk about a little
[41:45] bit tonight and and myself and brother
[41:47] seth kind of have have a lot of maybe
[41:50] some of some of the same information
[41:54] [Music]
[41:56] in regards to to this topic because it's
[41:58] it's uh you know galatians 5 1 right
[42:04] and then you have
[42:06] the bonus
[42:08] right when i think of bonds it's like
[42:12] there's not a no bigger bond or a yoke
[42:15] of bondage than being in financial debt
[42:17] no i must remember the money they
[42:19] started is that in the adult so what i
[42:22] want to kind of talk about today is is
[42:24] bonds
[42:27] and just real briefly you know kind of
[42:30] kind of kind of understand what they are
[42:31] because of course brother branham
[42:33] brother brown talks about how that that
[42:35] that rome has the goal yeah
[42:40] and then and then he mentions that the
[42:42] jews have the bonds
[42:45] and we understand we understand the
[42:47] significance of gold in both the natural
[42:50] and the spiritual
[42:51] significance
[42:54] the in the natural obviously it's a
[42:56] precious metal
[43:00] um i believe the last time i looked it
[43:02] was at like 1300 an ounce
[43:09] but but
[43:10] and of course in the spiritual gold gold
[43:12] is is the spiritual
[43:14] is it's deity right right
[43:17] okay so so we have we have the the
[43:19] natural we have the spiritual aspect of
[43:21] it
[43:23] but we don't we don't we don't hear a
[43:25] lot about the bonds
[43:27] and what role the the bonds play equals
[43:31] and what it means to us
[43:35] so basically a bond is is
[43:37] can be thought of like an iou um
[43:43] and it is
[43:44] what a country like ours
[43:50] uses
[43:51] to finance our
[44:06] the united states abandoned the gold
[44:08] standard
[44:15] right okay so what what what is what was
[44:17] the gold standard well the gold standard
[44:19] basically was simply explained like this
[44:24] if an ounce of gold
[44:27] cost five hundred dollars
[44:30] then every one dollar bill
[44:34] was worth
[44:50] there was a fundamental shift in our
[44:52] country
[44:55] and and most people don't understand how
[44:58] significant the shift was
[45:10] because we we abandoned the gold
[45:12] standard in the natural financially
[45:19] but we also abandoned the deity of jesus
[45:21] christ
[45:24] okay so so when this fundamental shift
[45:28] happens in in the united states we adopt
[45:30] a system called the the fiat money
[45:35] system
[45:37] and and basically what that means
[45:40] significa
[45:42] is
[45:43] we can make money
[45:46] as much money as we want we can print it
[45:48] all day
[45:52] and there is
[45:53] only one thing
[45:57] that makes that money worth anything
[46:04] and that is debt yes
[46:08] so when we print money
[46:12] we have to create debt
[46:16] to make that money worth anything
[46:21] so we decided as a country
[46:26] that we were to give up
[46:30] our money having actual value
[46:36] in favor of our money being worth how
[46:39] much debt we could get into infor
[46:46] so who would actually benefit from this
[46:49] debt
[46:49] beneficiary
[46:51] so the debt does two things
[46:54] the debt the first thing that it does
[46:59] is it produces cash flow for our country
[47:05] so when you hear on on cnn that they're
[47:08] they're trying to to propose a new
[47:10] budget
[47:16] it's because our country
[47:19] has created a whole bunch of ious acreal
[47:22] muchos
[47:26] and we sell them to whoever will buy
[47:28] them
[47:31] we sell our worth
[47:33] bender
[47:36] we sell the very heart of our country
[47:41] every single year cut that on you
[47:45] to to finance the operation of the
[47:47] country para financier operation
[47:50] so when i say that we had a fundamental
[47:52] shift in 1971
[47:59] radically as a country
[48:02] at the government level
[48:05] and at the individual level
[48:07] individual
[48:09] changed the way that we handle money
[48:12] gambia
[48:16] and we moved out of god's economy in
[48:26] and that's what in this world that's the
[48:28] way it's set up
[48:32] i mean think of it as a young kid
[48:36] the schools are pushing you to get an
[48:37] occupation
[48:42] something that you could you know
[48:44] fall in love with
[49:00] depending on the class you're part of
[49:02] depending
[49:04] uh as far as lower middle classes
[49:13] and this
[49:14] this is a recurring thing to achieve
[49:17] anything in this life
[49:22] brother branham talks about the rich
[49:24] merchants of this world
[49:28] and it's no coincidence why they set it
[49:30] up this way right
[49:35] because for you to get the american
[49:36] dream
[49:40] it is beautiful right
[49:42] now everybody wants the american who
[49:44] wants the american dream
[49:46] and you're probably you're living it
[49:47] right now
[49:51] you know other people looking at out
[49:53] outside in this is a wonderful
[49:55] opportunity
[50:15] but it's the way the system that we
[50:17] think already in our mind
[50:22] that we bought something
[50:26] but we're going to spend a lifetime
[50:28] paying it off
[50:31] and what they'll do is you sign a
[50:33] contract location
[50:35] you guys know
[50:36] about
[50:37] questions
[50:40] sign this contract
[50:42] and if you don't pay the student loans
[50:44] back
[50:49] they'll actually call your boss
[51:18] how much more how the bible talks about
[52:02] you can't
[52:12] [Music]
[52:15] and that's the biggest slavery and
[52:17] bondage that there is
[52:21] when work actually becomes
[52:23] more time
[52:26] than the time you actually give god
[52:42] our whole lives are dedicated to that
[52:43] and that's just
[53:00] that doesn't even include if you get
[53:02] credit cards
[53:06] because then you get credit cards to get
[53:08] the things that you want
[53:11] you know what i find
[53:15] so
[53:16] the amount of money they spent in credit
[53:18] card advertising
[53:26] i mean you go to the mailbox
[53:30] and most of the mail is
[53:32] an application to apply for a new credit
[53:34] card yes
[53:38] and what they want to do
[53:40] is that you have three credit cards
[53:44] why don't you apply for this credit card
[53:45] because you have great credit
[53:49] and you're an awesome bill
[53:51] [Music]
[53:53] you are a good servant brother carlos
[53:56] you need more bills
[54:01] so that that's that's how our country
[54:05] is that's how we as a nation is
[54:18] how does this how does this pertain to
[54:20] us as the bride of jesus christ
[54:37] go ahead brother ben so what you're
[54:38] saying is we become in bondage to
[54:40] somebody
[54:44] i decided to do it as a nation
[54:48] to the rest of the world
[54:51] and then as individuals
[54:53] individuals we become in bondage to
[54:56] the larger corporations
[55:00] so then when we go down there how
[55:02] vulnerable
[55:03] does it make us let's start off with
[55:06] comments
[55:09] then we'll talk about the spiritual
[55:11] aspect
[55:13] so where does that put us vulnerable as
[55:15] a nation when we go down this road that
[55:18] you said we just
[55:22] so as a nation what it does to us
[55:27] is it effectively gives the rest of the
[55:29] it turns the rest of the world
[55:46] so who loves the land of the three
[55:51] we're the land of the in debt
[55:56] you see what's going on and we kind of
[55:57] go back to the oil situation that's
[55:59] going on right now
[56:14] it's because when they don't produce
[56:16] more oil
[56:20] we have to fly our president over there
[56:24] and he has to beg for more oil
[56:29] so that's what it does to us in terms of
[56:31] vulnerability as a nation
[56:35] so refresh their minds what you said in
[56:37] the last week
[56:41] right now who holds our bonds
[56:44] so there's three of all the people that
[56:47] own our bonds there's three major
[56:49] there's two major countries and one
[56:51] major organization that holds our bonds
[56:56] superior
[56:57] china
[56:59] holds 117 trillion dollars worth of
[57:02] arbonne
[57:06] japan japon
[57:09] 113 trillion
[57:17] opec holds
[57:19] 268
[57:22] billion dollars worth of our debt
[57:24] dossiers
[57:38] there's 13 countries
[57:41] the biggest one of them all
[57:44] saudi arabia arabia
[57:46] and they hold yeah just
[57:49] so back to the back to the thing that we
[57:50] talked about the last time
[57:54] and the secret deal that was struck
[57:59] it's really saudi arabia that has the
[58:01] 268 billion dollars of our debt
[58:18] i wanted him to paint a picture for you
[58:20] guys
[58:37] and then we see where we're at right now
[58:42] so this paints and you could start
[58:44] seeing as we get to the end of this
[58:46] panel
[58:47] where we're going to end up
[58:55] amen so
[58:56] brother seth you can take it from here
[59:01] so i find you you can imagine something
[59:02] about the oil right
[59:07] last time
[59:10] the democrats
[59:11] democrats
[59:13] being persuaded or influenced right
[59:30] me telling me about it
[59:34] uh to go electric
[59:38] and how they're trying to discredit the
[59:40] oil right right
[59:42] or petroleum it used to be antecedent
[59:46] that the gold quelloro
[59:48] was the most important valuable
[59:53] and that countries
[59:56] would actually have wars
[1:00:12] i understood this and i know many
[1:00:14] questions are out there because
[1:00:17] you know we know what the prophet says
[1:00:21] so
[1:00:23] why wouldn't we just start digging for
[1:00:25] more gold
[1:00:50] with the debt standard as opposed to the
[1:00:51] gold standard
[1:00:53] it is
[1:01:10] and to keep up with the joneses
[1:01:14] and the trips to disneyland
[1:01:16] is a disneyland not that it's wrong no
[1:01:18] question
[1:01:19] but when we start living above our means
[1:01:25] and we lose christian stewardship
[1:01:30] and we get away from god's economy
[1:01:34] in favor of doing these things
[1:01:38] they call it the rat race
[1:01:43] and you're a mouse in that wheel that
[1:01:45] just goes like this
[1:01:50] and
[1:01:50] voluntarily
[1:01:52] they've created a system
[1:01:55] that we will willingly give up our
[1:01:58] rights
[1:02:01] give up our privileges as christians
[1:02:05] and sell that even
[1:02:07] for 30 pieces of silver
[1:02:11] so so we talk about let's talk about the
[1:02:13] spiritual aspect
[1:02:16] of spiritual before brother seth gets
[1:02:18] into
[1:02:31] we look at the spiritual aspect
[1:02:35] of spiritual we can show how we're in
[1:02:37] bondage right
[1:02:40] and how it
[1:02:42] takes full control of us
[1:02:46] as many
[1:02:47] that grew up in this church
[1:02:51] i remember stories
[1:02:54] asteroids i remember real live stuff
[1:03:00] when a brother
[1:03:02] wanted to
[1:03:04] watch tv
[1:03:06] television he would go to the video
[1:03:08] store ran a tv and a vcr
[1:03:13] television
[1:03:41] to the opposite point where we're
[1:03:43] completely relaxed about it
[1:03:50] and as we heard last wednesday
[1:03:53] we become completely relaxed and
[1:04:11] what what's what's crazy is that okay
[1:04:15] as we talk about this you know
[1:04:17] we have robbed from god
[1:04:22] god's economy is not the way the world's
[1:04:25] economy is
[1:04:27] the world's economy they want to put you
[1:04:29] in debt in an economy
[1:04:32] a pretty picture hey i'm gonna
[1:04:34] have money for a house
[1:04:37] you're gonna pay me more than what you
[1:04:39] that price is used
[1:04:42] but yeah we see here's christ
[1:04:46] i'm freely going to give you yeah
[1:04:51] pay off your debt
[1:05:04] what it really took for him to give his
[1:05:07] only begotten son
[1:05:11] you know you you see that that that in
[1:05:13] this yes
[1:05:15] he did it willingly
[1:05:19] gave his life willingly to
[1:05:23] nowadays you can't loan a person a
[1:05:25] dollar because because you know
[1:05:27] i might not get it back
[1:05:33] but yet christ asks you for nothing back
[1:05:36] but your heart.
[1:05:40] carlos
[1:05:42] everything else every demon in hell ever
[1:05:46] has control of the country's heart
[1:06:01] he lives here
[1:06:16] so so today
[1:06:19] we see that inflation costs
[1:06:23] it's a big deal in the country
[1:06:26] that they they say it's nine percent
[1:06:30] we know by the math it's it's upwards of
[1:06:32] 30 percent
[1:06:35] so in these inflation costs
[1:06:40] how how uh how did these inflation costs
[1:06:42] get like how do they get to explode out
[1:06:45] of nowhere
[1:06:48] so to understand inflation you have to
[1:06:50] understand economics
[1:06:54] in the most basic sense
[1:06:58] economics is simply supply versus demand
[1:07:00] economies
[1:07:04] that's all it really is there's a whole
[1:07:06] bunch of science behind it
[1:07:08] but it's supply versus demand
[1:07:11] when
[1:07:12] supply is really high
[1:07:15] and demand is really low
[1:07:18] that's where you see all the cool sales
[1:07:19] that you walk into and everything's on
[1:07:20] sale it's fire sale for everything
[1:07:24] when demand is really high
[1:07:28] and supply is really low
[1:07:31] that's where you find inflation
[1:07:35] because everybody needs to or wants to
[1:07:37] charge more
[1:07:41] for the product for the product then
[1:07:43] what it's worth
[1:07:45] right they're going to charge more
[1:07:47] bananas
[1:07:48] there's not enough noise
[1:07:50] so what does that make the what happens
[1:07:51] to the value of the dollar then
[1:07:54] exactly so so when your dollar
[1:07:57] five years ago
[1:08:00] you'd walk into walmart with a hundred
[1:08:01] dollars
[1:08:04] and walk out with a basket full of
[1:08:06] groceries right
[1:08:21] you get the little one that did you
[1:08:22] carry on your arm about that big car
[1:08:26] because they're charging for the bat the
[1:08:27] bag too right now right now they're
[1:08:28] charging for the bag
[1:08:31] because hey that's like 10 cents
[1:08:34] but did you notice in some countries can
[1:08:37] algonos
[1:08:38] that were depending on the us dollars
[1:08:42] they're totally wiped out yes
[1:08:46] and so we do understand the realization
[1:08:48] of cryptocurrency these days
[1:08:54] that these countries are actually
[1:08:56] looking to adopt
[1:08:57] as their nation's currencies
[1:09:04] because it's cryptocurrency but it is a
[1:09:06] cryptocurrency the government doesn't
[1:09:08] have control of it yet
[1:09:12] people are fighting for that control
[1:09:15] because if they can control it
[1:09:18] you can be their
[1:09:21] so that's where it gets into so this
[1:09:23] cryptocurrency is crypto
[1:09:25] you see that it was the ability to send
[1:09:27] money
[1:09:32] so i don't know some of you might might
[1:09:35] know or not know but
[1:09:37] how many have an iphone one
[1:09:39] telephone okay so if you have an iphone
[1:09:41] you can lose
[1:09:42] an iphone you can use apple pay
[1:09:45] very common right we can say
[1:09:47] i forgot your birthday card
[1:09:49] send you 20 bucks later right boom
[1:09:51] instantly it's there
[1:09:55] but in this you see how they're they
[1:09:58] they talk a lot about the chip in the
[1:10:00] hand and all this
[1:10:02] stuff that they want to say it's a chip
[1:10:05] okay get in the citizenship the craziest
[1:10:08] setup is that it's a digital wallet that
[1:10:10] you already possess in your own pocket
[1:10:12] right now
[1:10:26] it has control over your your identity
[1:10:31] control over your finances
[1:10:34] control of your gift card
[1:10:38] when we went to uganda we we had to
[1:10:40] wonder why
[1:10:42] we had to apply and put all of our all
[1:10:44] of our uh all of our shot records and
[1:10:46] everything on an app
[1:10:50] in an application they also can have
[1:10:51] complete control okay use some important
[1:10:53] things from one second to the next
[1:11:16] is we see that the gold had it got value
[1:11:18] because everybody loved it right
[1:11:23] it was shiny and all this stuff
[1:11:39] but now it all down now they they they
[1:11:42] call value in your digital stuff
[1:11:45] but how much screen time
[1:11:48] is so which creates these digital block
[1:11:52] chains this is this is get all of your
[1:11:55] information because of the heat
[1:11:57] it even plays on the economy in the
[1:11:59] sense of
[1:12:00] i tried this the other day
[1:12:03] i like to hunt
[1:12:05] and so i started talking a lot wait did
[1:12:08] you go to the metaverse
[1:12:12] i started messing around like you know i
[1:12:14] really would love to buy me a new rifle
[1:12:20] it's the weirdest thing
[1:12:22] all of a sudden you can go to your
[1:12:24] google search
[1:12:25] the first thing that pulls up
[1:12:28] hunting christians in arms are you
[1:12:31] kidding me has anybody ever noticed that
[1:12:34] if you're having a conversation
[1:12:38] all of the sudden there's a smartphone
[1:12:41] when you open it up
[1:12:44] there's an ad for that thing
[1:12:49] coolest thing is though you can get it
[1:12:51] financed
[1:12:54] i can't afford not to get it that's
[1:12:57] right well that's how it gets me without
[1:12:59] it everything that it gets you and it
[1:13:02] ties you to every little thing
[1:13:06] you like to watch on your smartphone
[1:13:08] everything that you search
[1:13:11] everything it all links right back to
[1:13:14] you through this digital name
[1:13:30] but it's not because of how awesome you
[1:13:32] are
[1:13:34] it's because how long you spend on that
[1:13:36] screen
[1:13:41] is how many ads they can expose you to
[1:13:44] get onto someone
[1:14:05] so how do we get our
[1:14:07] search engine
[1:14:08] in our minds
[1:14:11] is
[1:14:37] but we don't realize then our kids are
[1:14:39] already growing up
[1:14:43] so we've gone through these stages as
[1:14:45] each one of our youth is going through
[1:14:46] right now
[1:14:51] so how do we
[1:14:53] do the same thing in the spiritual
[1:14:55] aspect of it
[1:14:59] that every
[1:15:01] different thought would be a thought of
[1:15:03] god okay
[1:15:07] so i think it goes back to what our
[1:15:08] pastor
[1:15:20] how do we live in the realm
[1:15:25] that brother branham was in
[1:15:28] equality
[1:15:29] that realm of the holy spirit where
[1:15:32] you're in constant contact with him
[1:16:12] in genesis it tells you in genesis
[1:16:15] god created the heaven and the earth in
[1:16:17] these in in these six days
[1:16:22] what's crazy is that
[1:16:23] he literally took nine months though
[1:16:28] each and every one of us
[1:16:31] that way we all could have what we need
[1:16:36] in six days
[1:16:37] each and every one of us had nine months
[1:16:43] right but yet we don't rely on that no
[1:16:45] no
[1:16:46] that's what was
[1:17:11] yeah that's why the bible tells us we we
[1:17:13] receive our salvation through what this
[1:17:16] human's root spirit trembling okay
[1:17:18] immortal you know and you go to paul you
[1:17:20] say he said i sin daily
[1:17:25] we go
[1:17:26] we're human beings god made this and
[1:17:29] made us a certain way
[1:17:33] that we got this little
[1:17:36] roller coaster
[1:17:37] that we have
[1:17:39] if we never went to the lowest parts of
[1:17:42] our life
[1:17:45] then we wouldn't appreciate when he
[1:17:47] brings us to the highest part
[1:17:51] you know so we gotta look at our
[1:17:53] struggles as our
[1:17:56] character that's being built
[1:18:03] so that we're always in an expectation
[1:18:06] to receive from him
[1:18:09] you know but if we do not focus our mind
[1:18:12] on him
[1:18:15] we're going to focus it on the bad
[1:18:17] things
[1:18:19] because god because satan knows
[1:18:22] each one of our weak spots
[1:18:38] because if not and we're going to end up
[1:18:41] like our prophet said the nation would
[1:18:43] end up
[1:18:44] but
[1:18:48] busted and bankrupt that's right
[1:18:51] because that that's the meat and
[1:18:53] potatoes what we want to get to tonight
[1:18:57] you know we we want to see what the end
[1:18:59] result that that the prophet talked
[1:19:00] about
[1:19:04] how that this nation had to be bankrupt
[1:19:06] comes
[1:19:18] are you done
[1:19:22] so going back to where the gold's at
[1:19:26] if they can prove to you
[1:19:29] that you don't really like gold
[1:19:32] or it has no value to you yeah
[1:20:02] let's start doing something more
[1:20:03] electronic
[1:20:05] electronica and at the end of the day
[1:20:09] all the rich merchants dolos mercadias
[1:20:12] and everyone that's been paying all
[1:20:13] their debts up he closed
[1:20:26] but only when it's too late
[1:20:30] and it's already in the hands
[1:20:33] of rome the roma right so that there's a
[1:20:35] statistic
[1:20:37] that it shows that
[1:20:39] america has the largest federal reserve
[1:21:00] there's also other statistics
[1:21:03] that say the vatican
[1:21:06] vaticano
[1:21:08] has 20 million dollars in the federal
[1:21:10] reserve
[1:21:12] is
[1:21:27] in
[1:21:28] pueblito there's not always a walmart no
[1:21:31] walmart nope there's always a catholic
[1:21:34] church in every little town
[1:21:38] if you drive down from asia manigault
[1:21:53] is the government taking your money
[1:22:06] and they are still taking out your money
[1:22:21] i got a quote i want to read and only
[1:22:25] okay
[1:22:26] this is this is brother tommy okay
[1:22:28] in in cur the message is current events
[1:22:31] part one
[1:22:32] inside oh okay
[1:22:34] okay but current event but uh
[1:22:42] this is this is our founding pastor in
[1:22:44] 1993
[1:22:48] he says now this beast
[1:22:54] okay he says
[1:22:56] has what it's called the gold
[1:23:00] the jews have the bonds
[1:23:04] this beast is
[1:23:08] the bonds
[1:23:11] so he doesn't just want the gold
[1:23:14] he wants the bonds
[1:23:18] but he won't get it by himself
[1:23:26] this is 1993
[1:23:31] but he won't get it by himself
[1:23:35] he will go to where the prophet was born
[1:23:41] and in the midst of where the prophet
[1:23:43] was born is called egyptian
[1:23:49] which is the center is the great pyramid
[1:23:52] in the center of the earth
[1:23:59] everybody see
[1:24:00] that there it is
[1:24:04] everybody see that right there
[1:24:07] that was two years ago
[1:24:10] that man that the pope is shaking hands
[1:24:13] with
[1:24:25] he is the leader of all of the sunni
[1:24:28] muslims in the world
[1:24:34] in egypt
[1:24:36] that's him this is it
[1:24:39] brother tommy in 1993 is prophesying
[1:24:42] what's going to happen
[1:24:46] so so why is that significant
[1:24:51] because he's part
[1:24:53] of the bonds
[1:24:57] he's part of one of the countries in
[1:25:00] opec
[1:25:04] that hold the bonds
[1:25:07] the majority of all of the countries
[1:25:10] that are in opec the 13 countries
[1:25:16] are muslim
[1:25:20] so it's a mass it's it's a major thing
[1:25:23] and that's what it taught me in 1993
[1:25:29] so you when this unravels okay so you
[1:25:32] just
[1:25:33] try to look at it from afar
[1:25:39] you know these arab countries of opec
[1:25:41] okay
[1:25:42] it says
[1:25:44] they have our bonds they have a good
[1:25:46] portion of our bodies
[1:25:49] right so they have a lot of control hey
[1:25:52] mucho
[1:25:59] we wanted to go crazy and go after them
[1:26:01] that's right
[1:26:04] but they put on we had to put the brakes
[1:26:06] on
[1:26:08] he said remember
[1:26:10] record
[1:26:11] we got your bonds
[1:26:14] so
[1:26:14] so just a theoretical question
[1:26:18] we know what the prophet says he just
[1:26:20] looked at his
[1:26:25] how is rome going to go and take or even
[1:26:29] buy the bonds from opec
[1:26:35] the control that they have over the
[1:26:37] united states
[1:26:40] is worth more money than those bonds are
[1:26:43] worth
[1:26:46] so how is it going to be given up
[1:26:54] you know okay let's go back to
[1:26:56] the seventh or the six day war
[1:27:01] this is how bad the war is over there
[1:27:04] against israel
[1:27:08] israel
[1:27:09] the arab countries
[1:27:12] russia
[1:27:13] sends that fake signal out russia mother
[1:27:33] and that's why they end up saying it was
[1:27:35] six days
[1:27:36] six days of miracles
[1:27:40] you know so you start seeing you start
[1:27:42] seeing this the level commences and you
[1:27:44] start seeing how here comes here's going
[1:27:46] to come rome akiba roma
[1:27:49] so so when they go to get the balls
[1:27:54] this is just me now
[1:27:57] you know
[1:27:58] we've dug into this
[1:28:01] i know we've been digging into the the
[1:28:02] north and the south established
[1:28:06] and you look you stand up you say that's
[1:28:09] got to be his leverage point is
[1:28:25] and with that agreement
[1:28:29] it takes the bonds
[1:28:33] so you you can see how that how that
[1:28:35] starts unfolding
[1:28:39] which starts to take us to
[1:28:52] and all you got is a piece of paper
[1:28:56] you know because that's what the prophet
[1:28:57] of god tells us
[1:29:00] you know you want to read this brother
[1:29:02] brother omar this this is the meat and
[1:29:03] potatoes this is uh
[1:29:07] the i think that's the first sale
[1:29:10] and i just want you to listen to this
[1:29:12] part just because brother brown breaks
[1:29:14] it down step by step
[1:29:20] when we're talking about the financial
[1:29:21] part of
[1:29:29] rome and the jews will make a covenant
[1:29:32] with one another
[1:30:04] off
[1:30:06] the taxes
[1:30:12] for 40 years from now
[1:30:17] where are we at
[1:30:19] estamos plus there is only one thing
[1:30:24] can happen
[1:30:26] that's to call in the currency and pay
[1:30:28] off the bonds
[1:30:35] wall street owns them wall street is
[1:30:38] esto
[1:30:39] and wall street is controlled by the
[1:30:41] jews
[1:30:44] the rest of it
[1:30:47] is in the vatican
[1:30:49] and the jews have got the rest of it in
[1:30:51] wall street
[1:30:53] and wall street with the commerce of the
[1:30:55] world commercial
[1:30:57] we can't call it
[1:31:01] and then there's only one thing to do
[1:31:05] the catholic church can pay it off
[1:31:09] she is the only one who has got the
[1:31:12] money yes
[1:31:14] and she can't do it
[1:31:18] i'm sorry and she can do it
[1:31:20] and she will do it
[1:31:23] and in
[1:31:24] in doing this
[1:31:26] in a certain store to get it she'll
[1:31:28] compromise with the jews
[1:31:32] to make a covenant
[1:31:35] and when she makes this covenant
[1:31:38] with the jews now
[1:31:40] remember i'm talk i'm i'm taking this
[1:31:43] from the scripture
[1:31:46] and now when she does this
[1:31:49] makes this covenant
[1:31:51] we notice in daniel 8 23.
[1:31:54] uh
[1:32:24] as soon as he gets the thing wrapped up
[1:32:28] and gets the money of the jews tied up
[1:32:33] and when he does that
[1:32:35] oh my my o
[1:32:38] and in the midst of this
[1:32:40] three and a half years
[1:32:43] and he breaks the covenant
[1:32:45] as soon as he gets this thing wrapped up
[1:32:49] he gets the money
[1:32:51] of the jews tied up
[1:32:56] and when he does that oh my god
[1:33:00] he has called the antichrist until the
[1:33:02] end of the church
[1:33:07] for he is
[1:33:09] is he that i'm sorry and
[1:33:12] and has the children
[1:33:14] are against
[1:33:16] are against christ and the word is
[1:33:22] this man is called the antichrist
[1:33:26] now now he is going to hold the money
[1:33:31] and that's where i think it will come in
[1:33:33] uh
[1:33:48] and will be called the antichrist in the
[1:33:50] sight of god
[1:33:54] until the end time
[1:33:57] now but then he will be called something
[1:33:59] else
[1:34:03] now when he gets the money all under
[1:34:05] control
[1:34:08] then he'll break his covenant with the
[1:34:10] jews
[1:34:12] as daniel here said he would do it come
[1:34:15] on
[1:34:26] [Music]
[1:34:42] because he'll hold the wealth of the
[1:34:44] world completely
[1:34:48] economy
[1:34:50] and during that time
[1:34:53] them two prophets will arise on the
[1:34:55] scene yes
[1:34:58] and
[1:35:02] that's good right there but i wanted him
[1:35:03] to get to that last part
[1:35:07] we look at it just as the united states
[1:35:12] but she takes which rome takes it full
[1:35:15] control
[1:35:18] of every place that there's any type of
[1:35:22] the bride of christ there
[1:35:27] and that's where it gets nasty so yeah
[1:35:30] so you say okay we look at it and it's
[1:35:32] it's during that those three and a half
[1:35:34] years
[1:35:38] so don't forget there's that lap over no
[1:35:40] no
[1:35:43] when we look at it we may not completely
[1:35:46] be gone when when all that's happening
[1:35:53] there's parts that we may be here when
[1:35:55] we make because we talk about that
[1:36:01] and we may see part of it
[1:36:05] don't think oh we're free and clear when
[1:36:06] that happens no no physical no no
[1:36:13] why
[1:36:14] why
[1:36:15] then is
[1:36:17] is rome
[1:36:18] so interested in in the us
[1:36:22] first
[1:36:26] i mean why doesn't why doesn't she go
[1:36:28] after i don't know
[1:36:30] south america okay but nobody tells
[1:36:33] america
[1:36:34] why doesn't she go after uh i don't know
[1:36:36] some some other country
[1:36:39] i think where the carlos is because most
[1:36:40] of the countries rely on us
[1:36:45] we lead the world
[1:36:48] what happens here look at contest
[1:37:15] trickles down into the rest of the world
[1:37:36] and there's there's a num there's all
[1:37:38] kinds of and everywhere everybody's got
[1:37:40] an idea right
[1:37:41] what the mark of the beast is i mean
[1:37:43] obviously
[1:37:44] we know our prophet clarified what the
[1:37:46] mark of the beast is right it's apostasy
[1:37:48] right
[1:37:54] but in terms of in terms of of
[1:37:57] the financial thing because that's
[1:38:00] right
[1:38:05] how does that get how does that happen
[1:38:08] so again
[1:38:10] this is me
[1:38:12] one of the things that bonds do uh
[1:38:26] if your interest rate is 60 on a credit
[1:39:10] so that then that's just me yes this is
[1:39:13] you it's me
[1:39:14] that's what it is that's just me
[1:39:16] somebody else have any anything you want
[1:39:18] to add to that
[1:39:23] i think that kind of just real quick
[1:39:25] that leads into this
[1:39:29] is one world currency
[1:39:34] maybe that happens exactly the way
[1:39:35] you're talking about it
[1:39:48] i believe they call it like the blessed
[1:39:50] cryptocurrency it is a crypto
[1:39:55] and that they were aiming to be the one
[1:39:56] of the first you want to say los
[1:39:58] primeros nations to actually
[1:40:01] as a government to use this
[1:40:05] because they have their own bank right
[1:40:06] but it's of course right they have they
[1:40:09] have their own bank
[1:40:12] right they have the gold standard
[1:40:15] so they have what so in in accounting
[1:40:19] brother caleb knows this anybody is
[1:40:21] accounting
[1:40:22] you have what you call an asset
[1:40:26] and a liability
[1:40:30] ideally
[1:40:32] to be wealthy
[1:40:51] so
[1:40:53] does anybody have anything else to add
[1:40:55] to that
[1:40:56] i was just going to say
[1:40:58] in all of this
[1:41:00] it kind of makes you feel doom and gloom
[1:41:02] it
[1:41:11] and my god shall supply my all of your
[1:41:15] needs
