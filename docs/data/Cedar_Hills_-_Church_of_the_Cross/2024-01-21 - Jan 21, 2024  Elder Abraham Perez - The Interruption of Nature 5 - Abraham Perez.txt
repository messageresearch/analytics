the glory of God okay this is called you ask me how I see Jesus in my life I'll tell you how I see Jesus I see Jesus in my sister when she's behind the kitchen cooking and preparing the food for her husband I see Jesus when I see my daughter and the musicians playing violine the cello and other instrument and The Melodies that touch my soul I see Jesus and I Can Feel Jesus when I see the childrens reciting the scriptures I see Jesus when I see the consales swings I see Jesus answering prayers and fulfilling promises when I see my brothers and the sister in their post of Duty every service I see Jesus when I see the elderly couples so strong in faith I see Jesus when I see our pastor a gentleman full of kindness and godly love a humble man but behind the pulpit like a lion roaring the word of God preaching the word I see Jesus when our brothers and sisters come from Phoenix to preach and have fellowship with us I see Jesus in the beauty of the desert I see Jesus when I see the organ mountains and its pits almost touching the moon in a beautiful clear sky I see Jesus when I see the couples coming to the Altar and getting Mary pure and clean I see Jesus and the list goes on and on about how I see Jesus that I find no words to express my gratitude to my creator who open my eyes and let me see him in the Simplicity of Life tell me what power does it so now I ask you do you see Jesus in your life God bless [Applause] you and God bless you good morning it's not easy to come up here but overall I am grateful with the Lord the best thing is to be obedient and that is what motivates me to be obedient the Lord has done so many things in my life that I am more than grateful and just the fact of being here with you as a family it is a great blessing and I'm here to testify of of how great he is as you know our brother Diego a great man of God with the gifts that the Lord has given him to help us many times they are for us but not for him we know that because of the message some days back he he uh discerned the spirit of the sciatic I was one of them that had the problem with that nerve brother Diego he would ask me and tell me he'd ask me how do you tell me the truth be sincere and I told them brother I I do have some pain when you prayed and you discerned that Spirit something was let loose something that was very buried in there and when it was taken out it left a deep hole that still hurts but that doesn't mean that I'm not healed I am healed because it teaches us the message that when it hurts the most is because that demon has left our body what I had it is dead and it it it stinks what the message says and let me also tell you the closer we get to the attacks will be hard he'll attack in the way that you least expect and I tell my wife we're going to go have some dinner with with our buddies she said let's go and there may not be many of us but we gather together around a table that's that's you that's a a joy many times we just look at each other but that doesn't mean we're not attentive to what's moving God has promised in his word where there are two or three there I will be and he dines with us on Friday we were together having dinner and we were speaking about the word and when we were conversating about the word sometimes I don't like to speak because sometimes I say some things that I say why am I saying this but they're speaking with them there there was this cold that came to me that started at my feet I began to feel very cold and I didn't listen to it I stood up I went to the bathroom and I said leave me alone whether you like it or not we are his children so you have to leave you're not invited here and I went back to the table we continued talking but I felt that cold in my mind it it just felt cold went home and I began to feel very bad I felt my my stomach swell up and my mind oh the food was the food was bad and I said no it wasn't the food it is you that pain came that I've recognized that is called pneumonia it wanted to come to torment me and I felt sick and my wife and I tell my wife don't be alarmed something happens don't be alarmed everything is okay we are in his hands I went to go lay down and praying Lord what do I do the Lord tells me use the gifts you have gifts in the church let me tell you about these gifts if you don't we suffer more than what we should suffer because God placed gifts in the church for the help and the the name of brother Jimmy came came to me not here but he came here Jimmy Jimmy I told my wife please come call Brother Jimmy but you'll call him I don't want to speak because I'm in pain and spoke to brother Jimmy brother Jimmy prayed when while he was praying that healing was entering my body a a miracle was entering and I began to sleep like a baby like I've never slept before that's what I want to testify not just that a miracle was done not only that I'm Healed Brothers open up your eyes there is gifts here let us use them there's people that have gifts for bus we don't know how to use them and it's why the devil laughs but there is gifts let us use them we give thanks to God for being so good God bless you

happy to be with people that I will spend an eternity with but but today we're going to change gears because for the last three months we've heard such tremendous preaching from this pulit from Phoenix the Phoenix from South America the sou America from Mexico the Mexico and Wednesday from tuon Mir you know what Danny I couldn't compete with none of them yeah cuz Denny is a tremendous preacher but nobody gives more uh scripture than I do in this congregation because when I get behind here I want to be sure that it's thus say the Lord that's why I give so many scriptures so because our messages are not only to the local congregation amen so you pray for me so not to have you standing this will be my fifth lesson on the interruption of Nature and if you be so kind open your Bibles to Revelations 612 apocalyps 6 do and I be held when he had opened the six seal and L there was a great earthquake and the sun became black as s cloth of hair and the moon became his blood let's read one more scripture say Matthew 24 verse 21 and 22 for then shall be Great Tribulation such as was not since the beginning of the world to this time no nor ever it shall be and except those days should be shortened there should be no flesh saved but for the elect sake those days shall be shortened the Lord add his Blessing to the reading the word you may be seated good to see you Henry Henry my good friend Henry he's if you want to F From Here to Eternity make an appointment and he'll I remember when I was in Alaska and we used to go we went on a 200 mil SK Patrol and we travel with those Cross Country Skis how do you say somebody and those skis are not like they using the Olympics or the ski that are about this size they were about twice that long anyway after we were through with a 200 M ski patrol it was because when I was in Alaska it had barely become a state so there was a lot of Uncharted Territory and because we were the top company in the Battalion they send us and by the time where's Ruby Ruby where are you mom and dad oh okay I'm sorry Ruby you know where we stopped when we finished a town called Ruby Ruby in an all abandoned Schoolhouse and we were so tired that they took us to a little meow and one after another those small planes that they use in Alaska alas because Alaska is a state that has more plane crashes than any other state why you a lot of you can only travel a lot of times just in a plane and I could not believe they would fly and stop like in a poage St and I remember Henry telling me the the pilots of Alaska are the best pilots in the world right Henry correct Henry so but for some reason God still has me here and when he opened the sick seal there was a great earthquake Where have we heard of the earthquake and let me warn you this morning since we're changing gears this morning we're you better know how to swim because I'm going to take you through deep water St Matthew 2750 Jesus when he cried again with a loud voice yielded up The Ghost and behold the veil of the temple was ran in Twain From the top to the bottom and the Earth did quake in the Rocks can't eat that and the graves were open and many bodies of the Saints which slept AR Rose and says that the tombs were open so the question to you people who was in the Tomb now like I I've been teaching all these young ministers because that's my commission given to me by the founding Pastor to make bullet for all these young ministers and what I've taught them to not just read the Bible just from a book but you reading history bring it to right now bring it to the present time the Bible says when the veil was torn he told Jesus on the cross and they were singing hyn you imagine They Crucified him and they were singing him H to him the one that they crucified why was a veil tone did you have a veil on how many thieves on the cross and I ask a question this morning which Thief was you on the cross oh you said that none of those were were me I was ah but remember there was a St Luke 2339 and one of the maleactors which were hang ra on him saying if thou be Christ save thyself I can prove that all of you and myself were was that Thief you put a veil what is the Veil The Flesh you know you could even see that who was there in but the other answering rebuke came saying does not thou fear God sin thou are in the same [Music] condemnation I got to take care thank you gracias it's my body it's me comp we were out in the world we couldn't see none of this but let let let not me go ahead of myself notice we when we were in denomination we were in the Tomb you this why say who was in the Tomb we had a veil in those times we only thought that the Pentecostal and when I say Pentecostal I also means Apostolic the apostolic church was a Spanish version of the and when me and the founding Pastor were pastors of the apostolic church we only we only thought that what we were the only one that had the truth so that's why I says when we were on the cross but notice that's why brother Brandon preached the message I indict this generation for the second crucifixion of Jesus Christ we were crucifying him again that's why we were on the cross what were we crucifying we were crucifying the effect of the message because we thought that we only preach the truth but how were we going to get out of the Tomb Matthew 28 in the end of the Sabbath and it began to John toward the first day of the week Came Mary Magdalene and the other Mary to see the sepulture and behold there was a great earthquake for the angel of the Lord descended from heaven and came and rote back the Stone from the door and said upon it his countenance was like lightning and his rainment white as snow it was an angel that opened your grave because he made the earth quake which earth quake it was you you you there was the earth we are made of the earth we quake and who was the angel that came down and remove remov the stone what is the stone the revelation of the word see you're going to bring the things to right now no he an angel opened the grave so who was this angel I'm going I'm going to be giving scriptures to you can see this not brother land is just throwing you who was the the angel Open Your Grave you know you don't know tell them James huh Christ is he right so where was Christ let's go this is good you know you know Nik I'm proud of this youth when I was your age we were partners in crime I I there's there's the little Holy One with horns but look to it'san you so proud you and Margarita have your sons and all of your parents that have your youth here a small per a percent of the youth go to church all the of the youth well you know I don't have to explain all that so I'm proud of you Youth and look at taking note when I had the when I was your age I took notes to see where the girls lived I would take down a note to see where the girls lived or where there were the dance halls or or the bars I'm I'm ashamed of it but God had to take me out of the of the garbage of the sewer so I he had something for me thankful you know even though I was not worthy I have devoted now my life to him I am a slave for him I have a prison on my study at the house I spend hours and hours so I can feed you people and but I am thankful that I'm doing the will of the Lord and fulfilling the commission that the founding Pastor gave me he said at our age let's just start making just uh errors to this young no who was this Angel Daniel 10 Dan and in the 420 day of the first month as I was by the side of the Great River which is H then I lifted up my eyes and looked and behold a certain man clothed in linen whose loins were GED with gold of his body also was like the barrel and his face has appearance of lightning and and his eyes as lamps of fire and his arms and his feet like a collar of polished breast and the voice of his words like the voice of a multitude I am read this scriptures so you if God give you the Revelation so you can see who was this angel that took you out of the Tomb but brother L that's the Old Testament well brother said if you don't understand the Book of Daniel you will not understand the Book of Revelation apyp Revelation chapter 1yp what Daniel's prophesied we're going to see it fulfilled in Revelation one and in the midst of the seven uh candlesticks one like unto the son of Jesus Christ in Corporal body is not here anymore because he was in the office of son of man but notice one like the son of man with a garment to his foot and GED with a peps with a golden girdle didn't Daniel say about the a girl of gold so there it say and he says he travel like lightning St Matthew 24 verse 27 and getting more clear so you can see who Angel open your tomb notice for as the lightning that cometh out of Jeffersonville I mean the East it CH even to New Mexico Arizona in California BR today so you can see so shall also the coming of the son of man he saw around the K one like the son of man oh my God I mean you people by now should know all this but I'm I'm giving you a refresher course because I love you and I want to when I get behind this Pulpit the Eagles like to eat fresh meat Jacob I killed it this morning fresh so you can e amen and I spend all those hours because I love all of you and one day we'll be together never to separate amen amen notice can St Luke 17 24 for as the lightning here we go again the lightest out of one part the east of the United States China the other part under heaven to the West so shall also the son man be his day Carlos I cannot be more clear than that but I'm here to help you [Music] so you what happened you and I were stuck in the Kinder Garden grade I'm proud of you Julian you finally got out from [Music] there we were in elementary school oh you say brother L I'm not in elementary school well let's see if you are or not I'm not judging you the word is judging you Hebrews 5 for when for the time you are to be teachers oh my God you have needed one teach you again which be the first principles and my Bible does not say that which be the elementary teaching that's what the Greek says but your King James version it says the first principes but the Greek Bible says the element El principles of the Oracles of God and become such as have need of milk and not a strong meat look sistera I can't hear what you're saying okay go ahead I'm sorry I just didn't hear any of that let me pray for you okay no I like my no Lorena is like a second mother she bought brought me bought me a BB one time because I would slobber look Mary the word is so delicious sometimes they just slobber all over the place I can see your husband do the same thing in his wife in his mouth we we're cut by the same pair of scissors amen amen that's right the word [Music] my god oh it notice Elementary why Hebrews 61 therefore living the elementary Prin principles of the doctrine of Christ let us go into Perfection if you don't reach Perfection how are you going to get to the top of the pyramid if you only like cookies and cream you you're never going to advance you need strong meat I told Caleb once this happened a few years ago there are some people that criticize that say that I go too deep for them and Caleb said you know Tio that we have a bunch of eagles that need strong me in our congregation notice so why do we need strong meat now if the days were not cut short but for the elect sake the days will be cut short some of us will probably have our days cut short how many have you had relatives that their days were cut short and you know why their days were cut short in order for them to be saved not to make bride to be saved and you could you know you have had relatives that have gone young for a either because of a disease or cancer or something one way or another because God knowing because not even a li from a tree can fall without God knowing how come I remember when I was in the apostolic chch and I would say is God unjust how can he hate Esau without giving him a chance when they were still you know they hadn't been born he hated Esau and loved Jacob God knows your beginning to your end so he knows that if certain reties something happen or let him live something would happen and I could say more on that but let's go but here this scripture and like I said it's compound it's comp it is talking about the 144,000 because they are 144,000 by the time that they see that they had been wrong and then when Moses and Elijah came and introduce the message to them and they accepted their days were C short days 1,260 days they had months they only had 42 months to go years only three and a half years that's all you got they day days were cured but for the elect sake they were Cur how about the foolish virgin have we got any foolish virgins in this congregation the founding Pastor correct me mik if I say this wrong then the founding Pastor say there should be no foolish virgins in this congregation can you imagine the teachings and the preachings that have come behind this Pulpit you know what Henry Henry your father has a lot of Revelation but one of the last things he said from behind the pulpit what he said what is preached behind this Pulpit is not heard in other places you know not we're not saying there there to exalt anybody for a reason you know we know that the founding Pastor he left a standard here I haven't heard nobody teach like that man is that right Mike he's the greatest teacher that I ever heard so he left a standard I tell Caleb Caleb I see you back there and it's just like I'm seeing my brother preach back there well what Spirit anointed brother Brenham he come on the spirit of Elijah so Caleb doesn't he coming also on the spirit of his father yeah put two and two together that's why he looks so much like his father back here oh I just love when Caleb Gets behind her I said the SP image of his father notice than see how fortunate we are that we have get an apostle not to put the church in order to put the word in order there's a a pastor in Lima Peru Lima per oh he almost begs me to go to T Lima oh because they got a new Doctrine about saying that Joseph is the new prophet and I I don't know if they put him as the eighth messenger and the last time that the founding Pastor went over there he said I'll never go back to Lima because all you ministers can't see one another and have okay let's leave that alone the foolish virgins will be their days cut short also CU soon as after the Rapture remember brother renom said the foolish virgins should be glad that there is an atomic bomb waiting for them do that say the prophet so the days are going to be cured and when the sick seal was open there was a great earthquake and all nature was interrupted I don't have time to speak on this earthquake the Lord willing I will explain in another message but notice here Revelation [Music] 121p and there appeared a great Wonder in heaven of woman clothed with the sun and the moon under her feet and upon her head a crown of 12 stars and she been with child cry travailing in birth and pain to be delivered yes and there appeared another wonderand in heaven and behold a great red dragon heav seven heads and 10 horns and seven crowns upon his head we see two wonders a woman clothed with a son and we see a red dragon what is a Wonder amazed new a sign a mystery let's find out what the mystery is Revelation 612 and I beheld when he had opened the six seal and lo there was a great earthquake and the sun became black and said cloths of hair and the moon became his blood and the stars of Heaven fell unto the Earth even as a fig tree casteth her untimely fix when she is shaken by A Mighty Wind and when the earthquake hit the sign Sun became black as sa he was made of hair with that hair was coarse and rough not refined delicate in texture made of goat's hair It is worn as a symbol of mourning or penitence often with ashes sprinkled on the head and the whole Moon became as blood so notice here we see a black Sun but we read in Revelation 12 a woman clothed with the sun if you don't know the symbols you'll get confused and lost but let's see what's happening here John has seen a woman clothed with a son and it was shining but when he saw the six seal open he saw the same Sun closed in sa cloth for John was having a vision and Visions are symbols this woman clothed with a bright light but then that light started to fade away and that woman listen that woman clothed with a son was the Jewish Orthodox Church she had been clothed with the sun why because she was the wife of God she was a wife of God she was the begotten she was was beg God of God but she noticed but she was a wife of God and God had to put her away because some time back there on account of spiritual fornication and then he returns again and he receives her again and he mares her and what did God say that he was being married to a backslider the wife that went away from him we're going to heit that in a while so the Moon is just a shadow of the Sun and we see the Jewish Orthodox Church is fading out and the gospel is coming in and just as it's fading out notice is it is fading out there's got to be a new dispensation so the woman is with child and she's in pain travailing in pain in child birth on account of the Roman Empire so the law was fading out you know why it was fading out that was the dispensation of the candlesticks oh this is so good like I just keeps falling out of my mouth I I just love this notice the dispensations in the times of Moses there was a Tabernacle in the wilderness there was the outer cord what was the outer cord remember the the CR the oh we lived and my dad would make us go to church remember it was the dispensation of the candlesticks so we would go hating Church Elia but just when he couldn't take us to to the church that was in be there was a Southern Baptist Church that he made us go so myself and Tommy cuz my dad made us go and the Baptist Church was maybe about uh 200 yard away from our house so you walk up the steps they used to call it the southern CER Baptist Church [Music] and then we go and open the door and uh there was a like a a wall so either you went through the left or through the right but as soon as you walked there was like a holder that that they put the the the program of what was going to transpire we go and take it out and everybody got one and we walk real slow down the steps and we had to cross in a Roy and then we had to go across a royal the the creek the creek and there was a bridge so we went under the bridge well we had a cigarette we would light the if know if we didn't have one well we had to stay until 12:00 noon and my dad was at the door waiting for us how did they go at church look look look that this is what they preached on God that was us so you see how far we have traveled now amen so that was the outer cord why was it the outer cord the only light was a sunlight that was the only light that was when we were the thief on the cross but when when the light came we got a little light and we started going to to church we got promoted we must we were promoted to the inner cour now oh we were somebody what was the inner Court when we went from the Baptist Church to the apostolic church because in the outer Court where they kill the sacrifice and all the blood and everything oh but in the inner court is when they bathe you with the Waters of Separation they got everything the Waters of Separation that was the Apostolic Church separated us from the drugs from the drinking from the bad word now we were going straight to heaven because we were separated and we didn't need the sun because the Sun is going to stay black we had the electric light where's the electrician back there I mean he gave a good message when he preached about electricity the dispensation of the Candlestick look at how electricity SP the electricity electricity Hector didn't we think when we were there that we were the elect yeah electricity we were the elect because we separated the all our habits that we had but notice even the Virgin Mary got to that if the Virgin Mary hadn't given the other step she would have never made it even though she was the so-call mother of that's where we were how many of you have made it to the holy of holies because uh Pentecostals they were the closest to this message you know why they got to the Head age we're living in the head age and the Pentecostals only made it to the mouth the speaking in tongues but they forgot that there's another moving part in your head and that's your eyes what is the eye a the prophet we can see all over the place that's where you and I should be much to say said let me finish when we got to the inner Court we hadn't gone far enough that's why brother bam preached the message going beyond the temp if we only got to the camp there to the holy of hly the Mana that fell from heaven where was it did he it stop in the outer Court did it sto in the inner Court no but inside the holy of holies there was man that fell from heaven this message that we preach from behind here this man that fell from notice the word did the glory and when they got to the borderline in the times of Moses they did away with a tent and it says that of Glory it went to another Tabernacle not a tabernacle made of canvas it was a tabernacle made of fles amen amen and there still so many churches that still believe on the canvas tent I don't want to mention names but this this person you know he said that they already have a semi Tru to carate the tent can you imagine thousands following this message can they make a tent big enough to put all every it doesn't make sense but thank God God showed me a golden nugget not too long ago that even Caleb said forgive me this is not to exalt myself this just God is showing these things because we're on the last days and without looking for it as I was studying there in the house God gave me this gold nugget the tent was only the first pool and you know what Cale said he said Uncle that's all you had to say when I heard that I said oh my God you could have stopped there and we could have gone home that there was enough and I wasn't looking for it just the Lord took me there I didn't know that brother what are we the still in the first pool but a lot of people still in the first pool but what is the last pool the last the third pool did Noah have a third pool did Jesus Christ have a third pool without knowing we are in the third pool you know Noah the third pool the same thing that Noah did when God shut the door on the ark what God just nobody can open Noah was preaching to them and none of them could comeing he was preaching to the totally lost see God is giving us time to repent and to I mean there will be no EXC exuse for me or all of you the messages that come here from the pastor Tommy the [Music] ministers the but now we see the woman standing there the sun rising at her head the mo moon going under her feet it's done passed away she's done living through the through the dispensation of the law oh the the law can hang up there on the skies and the law is the moon but the but the law can shine you can see the moon up there and it's not shining the gospel all times the moon because now you know what gra is a dispensation of Grace but we're living in the dispensation of Grace and power of the Holy Ghost and the sun became black as Sao Jesus came first to the Jew not to the Gentile he came to his own and his own received that's why the Sun was shining around the woman Revelation 122 un and she being with child cry travailing in birth and pl pain to be delivered and there appeared another wander in heaven and behold a great red dragon having seven heads and 10 horns and seven crowns upon his head notice verse four and his tail drew the third part of the stars of heaven and he casted them to the earth when did he do that that his tail drew the stars of heaven and C them to the Earth notice Revelation 613 apocalyps and the stars of Heaven fell unto the Earth even as a f casted her untimely fix when she was was shaken by A Mighty Wind see when the six seal was open so we see here when J Jesus was born brought forth a Manchild who was Christ Jesus there's much to be say but I'm going to finish with this let's turn back to St Matthew 2429 Matthew immediately after the tribulation of those days shall the sun be darkened and the moon shall not give her light and the Stars shall fall from Heaven and the powers of the heaven shall be [Music] shaken and what tribulation is there after the tribulation of those days you know Paul what well how many tribulations are there since I've been in Silver City when I stand up and say things like this they get scared I don't ask you a question I don't think Caleb does the same thing he doesn't say that to see how much you know mean Noah Noah no what tribulation is there how many after the tribulation of those days I'll I'll give you a hint that's compound brother Brenham said that that was an amateure tribulation so if it was not the Great Tribulation which tribulation is that you know what Carlos and and brother Ben he put in parenthesis in paresis you know that their tribulation Henry and he say the ikan case so he gives you the answer right there the tribulation is when they killed millions of Jews in World War I when they when the Euphrates River dried out and those demons 200 million came out who let them out there were the four Angels they let them out the angels in the East the West the North and the South and who were the four Angels hit Hitler Stalin Stalin musini musolini and say those were the major ones in World War I they let the winds blow and kill millions of Jews and not only Jews all the innocent people that were killed in other countries that was the a Great Tribulation of their time but Jesus is prophesying about the tribulation that is going to happen when the six seal is open that's for another message so when the sun turns black the bride is gone it has sack cloth it is mourning why are they in mour give me again 24 uh 30 and then shall appear the sign of the son of man in heaven and then shall all the tribes of the earth mourn and they shall see the son of man coming in the Clouds Of Heaven with power and Gra now you see why the sun had set when the son of man when to put it clear so you you people can understand is when brother Brenham will take this message that we preach and take it to Moses and Elijah and Moses and Elijah will preach to them to get the 144,000 which the 144,000 will be the greatest missionaries in the time I ask the question what happens to the 144,000 and who are the 144,000 oh you say those those that went to church brother said a bunch of them are not but gamblers and none of them he so who knows who are the the 144,000 if the atomic bomb kills the foolish virgin who going to kill cuz they have to be martys who kills the 144,000 well who put Jesus Christ on the cross the wrong people will kill them the same people the they from they will murder the 144 and I got I could say much but I'm going to stop God bless you [Applause] amen see I'm a gentle amen let's all stand to our feet
