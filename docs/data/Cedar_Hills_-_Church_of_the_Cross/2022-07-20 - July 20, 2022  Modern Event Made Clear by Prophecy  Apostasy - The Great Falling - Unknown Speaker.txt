bless you just not to keep you standing for too long want to greet you in the name of the lord jesus christ uh it's our fellow lot this evening for these panels of uh current events made clear by prophecy to speak about the apostasy and uh it's quite the subject and uh pray that uh be a blessing here in a little bit we're just gonna switch to spanish momentos but we'd like to well you're standing read the second book of thessalonians 3 verse so let not let no man deceive you by any means for that day shall come shall not come except there come a falling away first and that man of sin be revealed the son of perdition he said you may be our pastor he encourages us to to partake so we can realize where we're at and what's happening yes henry it is an honor to be with my brothers when they uh asked me to speak of that subject of apostasy i started to think how this came about where did it begin we had to have a beginning word as such it comes from the greek apostasia is and i started to ask myself where did it all start they tried to track something and who was the first apostate in the bible and i started to search his qualities of this angel and found out that he was a rebellious angel based on his own beauty he revealed rebelled against god causing a riot in heaven the supreme of suffering that it rebels against power and authority and then i searched what does his beauty mean it found out that is the quality of a person thing to cause upon those that look upon them a certain sensorial pleasure intellectual intellectual pressure spiritual spiritual pleasure and he was able to achieve this with his beauty it was in such a way that he brought two third to third parts of the campaign so i started to see what was he preaching to them and he started to convince them because he forced he made a riot up there know he was cast down he was in the garden of eden [Music] and i can i can see that he was very upset he was looking impressed and as i was reading i went to the book of genesis 2 verse 9. and out of the ground may the lord god to grow every tree that is blessing to the site and good for food also in the midst of the garden and tree of knowledge of good commandments he tells men tells the man and and kennedy says yes he says this is genesis 2 16 and 17. human doctrine and the lord god commanded the man saying of every tree of the garden thou mays freely eat but of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil thou shalt not eat of it for in the day that thou eat is thereof thou shalt surely die but according to the message there is someone that is observing looking to see how he could also become a creator because he went against the lord because he went against the principles and when he was observing he realized there was a being there that he could use you know the bible says that the serpent was the most shredded animal of all the animals in the garden the messenger teaches us that it was the closest thing to adam now i see that he did the same thing as he did in heaven wrapped by the serpent he wrapped the serpent and anointed it was a intercourse that took place and from there there was two seeds eve partook with the with the serpent i mean he made also adam to partake of it and from that act from that action there's the seats that came out yeah and the son of the wicked one was always against the son of adam he went also against it how how did all this came walking across because that seed will always go against the seed of god there was jealousy there because of the one that became uh an apostate so i just follow him as he comes and he start to manifest himself as he comes through generations we don't have enough time but as we try to follow after he killed his brother the lord got him out cursed him he gets married he starts his generation god substitutes that seed that uh was killed by cain [Music] that satan had to always go against the things of god always contradicting as he continued the generations come so we can see how it all started my brother's here next to me they're going to continue i know what what is my capacity i can get it but i'm just following here how this apostasy started how it's manifested yesterday and as he comes walking vienna iran comes abraham and he was afraid because he he knew that his wife was as beautiful said he did it to was he an apostate an apostate is but there was two rebecca and rebecca was so worried because such a struggle only she knew what she was feeling only you ladies during pregnancy know what you're going through so she she got desperate and she inquired of the lord i believed he told her you know don't don't worry about it well there is two nations in your womb esau is what i'm wondering is that what were they fighting about to see who will come out first there was a fight going there as i'm telling you i don't want to go into too many details his seed comes forward but remember that god changed the name to jacob for israel and that was the beginning of nation and as you know you have to understand the bible to find out how would this begin and he had his brothers and the bible says that he his brother didn't love joseph because they were jealous of him they had jealous of joseph because he was the spirit they tried to kill as you know joseph ended up in egypt because that seed within within him how to be shown but there was a purpose behind all this that it was to preserve life and as this goes as i'm closing all at such a number that the bible says that pharaoh was afraid they start to get a little heavy supremiento you're suffering they will cry out they will pray sacrifice sacrifice and the lord remember them and he said i will get you out. and then moses comes to the scene to bring his people out as the plan of god starts to develop the people of israel rejected the prophet because they were always murmuring always criticizing in particular there were in part they were with it in part they were against it when it was for their convenience they were with them it was inconvenient for them they for me just pray for me but let us not go against anything against the prophet and the message god bless you each one of you yeah brother nervous but very very good that god got tired of it why would he get tired he was making his patients run out it got to such a point israel dealing so much with israel and israel would not accept the way god was doing it what did god do then he he wrote out a a letter of divorce you stop in san diego i was thinking about this basis because many times us as christians sometimes legally it seems like we're almost in the same circumstance and when we receive the counsel of god okay i've already warned you i gave you the medicine and you you just won't take the medicine my question came to me is this [Music] [Music] we can see here how these two seeds from the womb they were already fighting and they always were there even when they ask jesus what do we do with this seed are we gonna just rip it out of the ground no leave it there no not knowing it plucking it up we also pluck up the the wheats according to this what we must be most conscious of then is the apostasy has always been the bible says it is they're the ones that know me more um and that's the way i've been able to remain standing since a little child testimony olympia i've always tried to keep my testimony clean and maybe look like i've been a little religious but that's what it sustained you know how we have confidence with our wives yeah i tell them you know what this is just not right [Music] and maybe to somebody that happened this has happened the same thing how does the sister zone so do this it does this okay then i just become silent i say lord there's an alarm that goes off if there was something when god made such an accusation against or something against because everything began fine in ephesus it looks like everything is beautiful as the journey begins then then they begin to find that the weight becomes very full of stickers very sticky the way okay here i go with this here that the apostasy the word apostasy means to go back or to fall away because of these sticky paps or things that we go through in the way and then many say oh i don't want to go that way the example we have in the scripture is uh lot's wife even though she came out with this they came out of sodom and gomorrah counsel as as your brother flee from that flee from from all appearances of sin automatically the spirit of god will tell you this is not right it was now in the church already and the council that he gave them was love one another the best thing that you can do is to love one another i said this to the pastor and i hope this will help you because antichrist is something that goes against christ it's everything that opposes itself against everything that is called god god had something in favor with the church of ephesus they had tried the apostles it said moved so easily that's what paul gave counsel to not be easily moved from that faith when the false apostles entered into the church of ephesus you're not speaking the same thing that paul spoke the devil's not really going to come out and just reject a truth what does the devil do when the devil says something is really good is happening in the church is you're very far away from the world speaking of the gentiles being the first church of the gentiles from there the this apostasy began brother branham says significant backslidden the the backslidden church brother branham says ephesus was not a deceived church but a church that fell on its own but not to continue in perfect love and he says here episode as a summary are fruits without love it's what brought them to apostasy that the [Music] there's the danger point right there i always ask that question to myself why did paul say it if he calls that you are built upon the foundation you come against that except they be in agreement jesus jesus he knew judas was did he cast him out no he was right there with him but sooner or later he had to give up forth his fruits to us than this work is more important so many things that we could add to that it's more important than congregating together i think it's time to take inventory of our conditions because if there's something that paul says don't forsake the assembling of yourselves together accustomed to do that they don't have their revelation it's they were going to get so comfortable with so many commodities in in this career to go out of the way they relaxed oh the preacher if you need to speak about love you can just hit a few buttons and talk about love yeah and that's there's everything's there but we forget to look for the more important thing it's that is the divine inspiration of god everything seems to be so easy for us we didn't even have the beds they just like had pillows or there or something but we would pray they would ask me about the resurrection i knew what the resurrection was about i i know what healing is what a miracle is nobody can tell me about healing or miracles even though that's okay but because i already experienced it but as time goes by you know and you relax it the result of all of this it begins in one person it begins just with one person and then they can make a competitive commentary and they say we can relax okay oh okay that's okay you could get to their homes and say how are we how are we doing your young man's up with a worldly girlfriend la nina oh god what happened here because something the most tremendous thing about this is is it the devil he always goes coach to the head first the devil always want to look to israel looks at everything being at fault what happened to them but god tried to to bring them back that they would rise up they didn't want it the apostasy so much entered into them [Music] oh yeah a condition or something when i was 16 years old they asked me that question christian are you a christian i said want one of my friends to know that i was a christian no brother afterwards what a pain what a suffering i went through i felt like peter [Music] until it reaches into a complete apostasy and speaking on this of apostasy in espanol is it refers to our brothers have tremendously brought us we have about 25 pages of quotes and 25 verses at all we're not speaking to a people that have never heard of the lord but we'll quickly quote them as our brothers have quickly quoted certainly and we do not give it the importance that we should persona because we always see it in another person i when the scripture speaks of apostasy it also uses the term iniquity muchas versus many times it's not speaking of the sinner that has never heard the word but when it speaks of inequity it speaks of those that know to do well not to do right and do not do it [Music] the majority of times where it refers to apostasy it refers to acts of inequity the the book of micah the lord speaking of israel and we'll mention it very quickly in the book of micah the lord's the lord says and i'd like for us to read this in the book of jeremiah chapter 2. the lord after all that the the brothers have spoken israel how many times the lord had to deal with israel it is an incredible question because let me ask you something has any of you read the bible i imagine yes have you read of the people of israel have you reached the conclusion where you ask what's wrong with these people have you ever had that thought that better describe the condition of israel well what if someone saw us in this moment what would they say israel had now crossed but before that he he began with this in jeremiah chapter two the lord says the word of the lord came unto me saying and i come along [Music] in a land that was not sown israel israel was holiness unto the lord the first fruits of his increase all that devour him shall offend us evil shall come upon them saith the lord yes how the lord begins to begin to tell them that he's tired of that that's enough and until it comes to verse 17. procured this unto thyself and that thou has forsaken the lord thy god what have you in in the way of the lord that you drink the waters of denial and what have you and on the way of assyria that you drink out of the water of the euphrates your wickedness shall punish you i rebellious know how wicked and bitter it is that you have left the lord thy god and have lacked my fear in you el senor saith the lord the lord of hosts and graces and mercies that had existed but israel is only a type we are not israelites what does this have to do with us in the same way in the book of timothy chapter four first timothy chapter four and some shall depart from the faith escuchando espiritus en canadores giving heat to seducing spirits and doctrines of devils speaking lies in hypocrisy having their conscience here with the hot iron case forbidding to marry and commanding to abstain from meat which god had created to be received with thanksgiving of them which believe and know the truth we're running out of time but as we continue i'm going to tell you a second timothy 3 estamos parden del tiempo pero continum the lord speaking to the gentiles the same terms as he spoke to the the people of israel in jeremiah this know also that in the la in the last days perilous day perilous times we know we live in in perilous times right search this scripture go here to finish my time i want to bring something that's very significant and firstly i want to bring the definition of apostasy according to the dictionary which is to abandon the faith the act of leaving behind or to stray from a political belief or a principle or that is or religious the word apostasized also comes from the word of apostasy apostasion apostasize significa which means separated divorce divorce i i i found uh something curious with this uh apostasy the word apostasy there's two definitions and one of them is written a bit different yes a criminal offense of heresy by not believing a religion now an apostate one who has abandoned the religious faith a political party someone guilty of apostasy someone who has abandoned the principles los unanimos de la posta the synonyms of apostate is strayed backslider her backs backslider cafe one of little faith uh disloyal renegado uh if you're not associated with a certain religion you're a mugwoman someone who has reversed infidel incredulous a lot of men in the old testament as apostles as was abraham he denied the faith to save his own skin david david fell in apostasy to seek something to to go out of the faith automatically becomes apostasy but it's not condemned as such because he has not completely left it would fall back up a little slower and they thought whether they had to get back up or not especially the fall didn't feel so bad after three four times it's not necessary to get back perhaps being fallen is better than being upright they continued in that way as a people until they reached a condition they entered into a complete apostasy and they denied the lord jesus christ when the uh this son of sin it's judas i want to go into something that i thought was very interesting when we speak of apostasy by denying the the faith or being backslidden or such i don't believe every case is the same some may fall in inequity if they do not know right no no you have to know what's right for it to be iniquity many come to church and then they leave and they go back to the things of the world and you said well they used to help insurance they used to sing and yes that does not mean the brother or sister had a new birth can someone fall again if they never really had an experience to begin with a church is a very kind social club and there's people that go to churches for to to socialize this yeah especially they go to church they have a very nice car they go very well presented that's where the arrow is committed because there is of those that they they stand and then they say well we are we stand faithful here in the faith don't come here that's an identification many people are rising up right now because they're my friends and you say well brother if you don't believe like that you're not a bride i don't pay attention to that will the ones with paul will they enter in when brother brynn would be on the curtain of time what did the boys tell him yes or no yes we're going to be fine the word is the only thing that will keep us the church cannot do the work for the individual nor can the church do the work for the home is iglesias problem says the churches that are falling in apostasy they become foreign we're making the people come and accumulate and stagger stagger and confess and they leave and what we need is a moving uh an old-fashioned a breaking up old-fashioned breaking up old-fashioned breaking up uh but the failure many times begins there we bring the children to be dedicated presented unto the lord as all you young people have been here in the first few years but you have to blame someone the the son is not walking in the ways of the lord well iglesia well it's the church or it's the ministry okay the thing is we don't understand the word when it's said unto us bless you to raise them in the admonition of the word we have entered as israel had been this year to say we presented you we dedicate you as a good so i have to go to work to give you what you need is there a family altar at home let the holy spirit inspect because the answer we receive we know is not the truth how many of the holy spirit is all heareth and knows to do right and does not do it it is apostasy because iniquity is being done to be able to teach them enough so that they reach a point where they can walk the same hallway evening come to the same and dedicate their own life unto the lord through a personal experience when the parents have not left that part our time has left but we'll make a point here regresando israel returning back to israel when they went into babylon in alexillo babylonio in the babylonian exile it was a difficult condition but it's not as bad as as you may think because as they arrive to babylon yeah a different government they no longer had authority over themselves in babylonia in babylon it was death mientras as long as they did not do like the babylonians babylonians did not bring them as egypt used them now this is history they understood as long as you do it as the way of the babylonians so the priests caviar babylonia that there was in babylon they they stood at their they mix themselves with the cultures of babylon says what happened after babylon with the jews it is said to israel israel the religion of israel or israel as as as such came to an end but their judaism began because moses said uh the lord will uh lift up a prophet his eye as they were in babylon in the priesthood speaking they came out with the principles of the faith of the jews and they believed the creator blessed be his name creator of all things only he made them and will make them that the creator blessed the the prophecy of moses our teacher that he rest in peace his prophecy shall remain forever that the torah would not be changed or replaced and with all these commandments to punish all that uh trespass these commandments the lord began to show something about the gentiles where the faithful man is and began to show unto him a dispensation of a people that were not jewish we know that in in the way of a symbol began to show itself unto the gentile people as the lord did this with daniel the ministerio los levitas the priest the ministry the levites a heretic and an idolater and unto this uh judaic religion jesus is the greatest apostate ever thing the third principle of the principles of the judaic belief this in it says i believe completely that the faith of the creator blessed be his name nor affected by physical males they blinded themselves since babylon but in their mentalities back then wanting to do what is right in apostasy without entering into the world and doing things the right way and return unto the lord they continued in their era their error continues until they entered a complete apostasies they did not deny the lord when they crucified him they they denied him when and amongst themselves they uh formed this norm [Music] we know something i'd like to clarify real quickly the difference between christ and the antichrist is that christ and christ is made a man god can become a man that's christ but the antichrist is when man tries to make himself god when man wants to be come god and in babylon the people were mixed there was a remnant that did not mix brother branham then praise says and live the life of christ because for there to be apostasy there has to be someone that stands for the truth to identify apostasy [Music] [Music] there are so many things that happen around us [Music] lord i don't ask that you take away our trials [Music] but only that you help us to remain in your word because by your word is how we can overcome jesus as jesus overcame con la palabra with the words [Music] you know the struggles and the trials please help us and give us encouragement to continue forward as that elder said that we may love [Music] in the name of the lord jesus christ thank you [Applause] [Music] i am thine oh lord i have heard thy voice and it told thy love to [Music] but i long to rise in the arms of faith and be closer drawn to thee [Applause] [Music] the lord to the cross where thou has that oh dramini [Applause] [Music] say lord to thy precious bleeding side o constant me now to thy service lord by thy power of grace divine and let my soul look up with us dead past hope and my will be lost in [Music] blessing lord to the cross where thou hast died oh lord to thy precious bleeding side [Music] and there are depths of love that i cannot know until i [Music] and there are heights [Music] joy that i may not reach till i rest in peace with thee draw me nearer draw me nearer [Applause] [Music] lord to the cross where thou hast died [Music] [Applause] [Music] the lord to thy precious [Music] hallelujah [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] is [Music] [Music] [Music] the [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] oh [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] is [Music] [Applause] foreign [Music] [Music] oh [Music] oh [Music] oh [Music] [Music] and thank you jesus oh thank you jesus [Music] thank you jesus oh thank you jesus oh thank you jesus oh thank you jesus thank you jesus [Music] thank you jesus [Music] amen god bless his word amen what a word glory how many are one of them [Music] now there are people almost
