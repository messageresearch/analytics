[21:32] worthy amen y may be SE at this time
[21:36] we're going to have a poem by our
[21:38] brother Julian
[21:39] hill julan hill
[21:58] amen God bless you uh as always this
[22:02] poem is available in Spanish if you
[22:03] would like it but it's also going to be
[22:06] available in English because it's a
[22:07] little complicated so if you get
[22:10] confused even speaking English just ask
[22:12] for a copy and I can get you one uh this
[22:15] poem is called the
[22:17] anomalies the world consists of 8.1
[22:20] billion people of that number 2
[22:23] b173 mil1 180,000 are Christians of that
[22:28] that number
[22:30] 2,173 1880 are not Catholic Orthodox or
[22:35] Protestant according to recent data
[22:37] roughly 2 million Christians are message
[22:39] Believers which in percentages is
[22:42] 0.025% of the world's population as low
[22:46] it as it is this percentile is called a
[22:48] statistical improbability also known as
[22:50] an anomaly it is highly unlikely for a
[22:53] number in that percentile to exist which
[22:55] is to say that it is highly unlikely for
[22:58] you to exist the type of person who
[23:01] would base the reality on anomalistic
[23:03] alone is known as a non-believer they
[23:05] use science to try to explain the
[23:06] unexplainable world around them these
[23:08] statistics that don't make sense a
[23:11] Believer however sees things differently
[23:14] a Believer looks at anomalistic and does
[23:15] not see statistical improbability but
[23:18] the precise evidence of the Divine the
[23:20] hand of God in this time the times
[23:22] before and the times to come we are the
[23:25] anomalies what a compliment and
[23:27] encouragement to know that our
[23:29] manifestation is quote highly unlikely
[23:33] however scientists still find room for
[23:35] doubt in the mathematics of chance and
[23:36] likelihood in odds an odd is simply the
[23:39] extent to which something is probable
[23:41] but With God all things are
[23:44] possible though the devil tries to
[23:46] manipulate mathematics and science to
[23:47] his whim God is the creator of them as
[23:51] is evident in his word and expressed in
[23:53] his numerology what man calls chance the
[23:56] believer calls by its synonym the odds
[23:58] or the
[24:00] expectation therefore the prospect of
[24:02] God is more than the likelihood of a
[24:04] future event it is the it is Hope and
[24:07] confidence in what is to come the odds
[24:09] of the Lord are not the ratio between
[24:11] the amounts stated by the parties to bet
[24:13] implying a failure to those who agree
[24:15] with him but is evidence of the
[24:17] different unusual and strange to the
[24:20] world we are unexpected to God we are
[24:24] the
[24:24] expectation what is the expectation of
[24:27] God and His Thoughts peace and not of
[24:29] evil to give us an expected end and the
[24:31] hope of his righteousness with his
[24:33] expectation becoming our own is gladness
[24:35] unashamed boldness and the magnification
[24:38] of Christ in our bodies by life or by
[24:40] death it is the knowledge and wisdom
[24:42] unto our souls it is rest goodness to do
[24:45] justly love mercy and walk humbly that
[24:47] all Grace May abound that we will have
[24:49] all sufficiency to every good word to
[24:51] show us Great and Mighty things
[24:53] established with light shining upon us
[24:55] always to move mountains to restore dry
[24:57] bones to love and speak words of
[24:59] everlasting life among other things the
[25:02] world cannot understand this they cannot
[25:04] understand us and more importantly they
[25:06] cannot understand God they use math
[25:08] science and even theologies to attempt
[25:10] to do so but he cannot be intellectually
[25:12] conceived he is intimately known inside
[25:15] the heart therefore unless they know God
[25:18] they cannot know the anomalies for the
[25:19] anomalies are more than evidence of the
[25:22] highly unlikely but are better placed as
[25:23] the absolute outcome of God's
[25:26] predestination thus even even when
[25:28] examining math it is more unreasonable
[25:30] to believe that we are not divinely
[25:32] placed by the hand of God than to
[25:33] believe the very existence of the True
[25:35] Believer is divine intervention we do
[25:37] not reason our way into faith for by
[25:39] reason we can come out of it by faith we
[25:41] can go in we believe in the perfect plan
[25:43] of God which has and will always have a
[25:46] 100% probability of success which to man
[25:49] is considered statistically impossible
[25:52] With God all things are possible behold
[25:56] the anomalies the nearly impossible
[25:58] people that as time goes on only become
[26:00] more improbable we are the walking
[26:02] evidence of God that the world has
[26:03] dismissed him the court of public
[26:05] opinion and what of it why should we
[26:07] care about what the world thinks when we
[26:09] have the word of God which is not an
[26:10] opinion but the truth though they
[26:13] attempt to Tower over him with their
[26:14] Babel they will never come as close to
[26:16] him as us the only ones who can come up
[26:19] higher are his people his children who
[26:21] are The Chosen the anomalies those who
[26:25] despite the division are multiplied
[26:27] despite the faction fractionalization
[26:29] have been made whole those who the who
[26:31] in the equation of mortality had their
[26:33] memory subtracted while sin was added
[26:35] only for Christ to subtract the sin and
[26:37] add himself as the missing variable
[26:39] implementing the equation of restoration
[26:42] this is the math of God the expectation
[26:44] the ultimate conclusion become a part of
[26:47] him be the anomaly the difference the
[26:49] outlier the evidence the unexplainable
[26:52] the incomprehensible the undeniable the
[26:54] unshakable the odd one out the
[26:56] unexpected The Peculiar the abnormal and
[26:59] above all the expectation do the
[27:02] impossible for you are the impossible
[27:05] the very life in you is evidence that
[27:07] the impossible can be possible who is
[27:10] the enemy to tell us what can and can't
[27:11] be done who are they to say that it
[27:13] cannot be done again in a world of
[27:15] problems you are God's solution God

[35:20] rough isn't
[35:22] it cutting off the trail of the serpent
[35:31] in your
[35:33] life
[35:34] amen praise the Lord and we're going to
[35:37] go to our first
[35:40] scripture in Numbers Chapter 14
[35:47] num and here Moses is speaking to
[35:54] God the people have rebelled against
[35:57] Jehovah
[36:00] and it looks like God's going to destroy
[36:03] them and wipe them off the
[36:09] map but there's a man that stands
[36:13] up named
[36:16] Moses so I want you to keep this in
[36:20] mind under Moses they came out of
[36:26] Egypt and they were baptized in the
[36:31] sea type of
[36:35] justification they went into the
[36:38] Wilderness which is a type of
[36:43] sanctification and then as they
[36:45] journeyed on in their
[36:48] lives they came up to the
[36:52] Borderland where they had to cross over
[36:55] into the Promised Land
[37:00] which is a type of the Holy
[37:04] Spirit my we're going to see how that in
[37:07] this process of the new
[37:12] birth how these complexes hit
[37:16] us in
[37:18] justification sanctification we're going
[37:20] to be going back over just a little bit
[37:22] what we hit about what three weeks ago a
[37:25] month ago or something like that
[37:30] but I wanted to use this example
[37:34] here verse
[37:36] 11 states and the Lord said unto Moses
[37:40] how long will this people provoke me and
[37:43] how long will it be air to they believe
[37:46] me for all the signs which I have showed
[37:49] unto them
[37:59] I will Smite them with pestilence and
[38:02] disinherit them and will make of thee a
[38:05] great nation and mightier than
[38:15] they can you imagine Moses if he was
[38:17] full of himself excuse the
[38:22] expression he was oh
[38:25] boy he's going to disinherit them
[38:28] and he's going to make me greater than
[38:31] them Moses was a type of
[38:35] Christ he knew that without the his
[38:38] brothers and
[38:41] sisters that none of them would make
[38:45] it what a tremendous thing God spoke to
[38:51] him and Moses said unto the Lord then
[38:54] the Egyptians shall hear it for thou
[38:57] brought us up this people in thy might
[39:01] from among
[39:09] them and they will tell it to the
[39:11] inhabitants of this land for they have
[39:14] heard that thou art Lord among the
[39:16] people that thou art Lord art seen face
[39:20] to face and that thy Cloud standeth over
[39:24] them and that thou goest before them by
[39:27] daytime in a pillar of cloud and in a
[39:30] pillar of Fire by
[39:49] night oh my goodness Moses is standing
[39:52] in the bridge
[39:55] here now if Thou shalt kill all this
[39:59] people as one man then the Nations which
[40:03] have heard the fame of thee will speak
[40:15] saying because the Lord was not able to
[40:18] bring them this people into the land
[40:20] which he swear to them therefore he hath
[40:23] slain them in the wilderness
[40:32] I believe Moses took this
[40:35] personal he could see what the peoples
[40:38] of Egypt would say about his
[40:42] God that he was not able to bring them
[40:45] to the promised
[40:47] land let us pray before we
[40:50] continue Lord Jesus we thank you
[40:54] tonight for this Grand opportunity Lord
[41:00] to speak Thy word to your children
[41:04] Lord May It Be You
[41:07] Lord not Jimmy alire no Jimmy alire May
[41:11] Jimmy Aly just be dead like an old
[41:13] crystallized serpent on the pole
[41:19] Lord no life In Me Lord but the life of
[41:23] your word and your spirit
[41:27] believe your word Lord thank you
[41:30] Lord in the precious name of our Lord
[41:32] and Savior Jesus
[41:34] Christ amen
[41:36] amen may be
[41:40] seated let's continue with verse
[41:43] 17 now here's the spirit of Christ in
[41:49] Moses now I beseech thee let the power
[41:53] of my Lord be great according as thou H
[41:57] has spoken
[42:03] saying that the Lord is
[42:06] longsuffering of great Mercy forgiving
[42:09] iniquity and
[42:11] transgression and by no means clearing
[42:15] the
[42:16] guilty visiting the iniquity of the
[42:18] fathers upon the children unto the
[42:21] fourth third and fourth Generations
[42:39] in other
[42:40] words he can
[42:42] forgive he can have
[42:46] mercy but there is a trail of
[42:50] iniquity has come from the beginning of
[42:55] time and even though has Mercy on those
[42:58] people
[43:01] there that trail of the serpent
[43:04] continues
[43:07] on now for our new
[43:11] people I want to make sure you get
[43:16] this the word
[43:20] tra a marked or established path
[43:28] a trace or Mark left by something that
[43:32] has
[43:38] passed when it pertains to your life
[43:41] we're not going to go into what the
[43:43] trail of the serpent
[43:48] is actually the prophet never preached
[43:51] that
[43:54] message literally
[43:57] he mentions it in six
[44:01] messages all preached in
[44:06] 1965 hee he he preaches it in the power
[44:09] of
[44:12] transformation he he preaches it in
[44:14] God's only provided place of
[44:17] worship he preaches it in in
[44:23] leadership he pictures it th shall
[44:26] possess the gates of his
[44:28] enemy six different times he mentions
[44:32] this Trail of the
[44:38] serpent from the
[44:41] beginning he says and when I go home
[44:43] this time I'm going to preach on the
[44:45] subject the trail of the
[44:49] serpent the beast at the
[44:53] beginning and the Beast at the end
[44:57] and Trail him through the
[45:00] Bible and show how he heads
[45:06] up and he goes in how cunning that
[45:09] fellow
[45:12] is the
[45:15] serpent not just an
[45:18] animal that Satan
[45:21] used to inject himself into Humanity
[45:28] that's what happened in the
[45:30] beginning and that's why to you new
[45:33] people if you don't truly understand how
[45:38] the fall
[45:41] came and how the devil injected himself
[45:45] into you or the human
[45:50] race you'll never truly understand why
[45:53] you need to be born again
[45:59] it's so easy to understand if we'll put
[46:01] on our spiritual
[46:06] caps that we were born the wrong way the
[46:10] first
[46:13] time under the permissive will of
[46:17] God we're not going to go into
[46:20] that but the religious world today
[46:22] doesn't want to face this reality
[46:28] of what happened in the Garden of
[46:30] Eden and how many knows they ate
[46:37] apples that's a religious
[46:40] Fable we're not going to go there but
[46:44] we're going to show you how when Satan
[46:46] mixed himself into
[46:51] Humanity it degenerated man from a son
[46:55] of God
[46:58] to just an
[47:00] animal just a
[47:02] mamal walking upon the face of the
[47:08] Earth without any
[47:11] purpose without realizing why God had
[47:14] put him on
[47:17] Earth do you know why God put you on
[47:20] this
[47:23] Earth praise the Living God
[47:28] so how does that trail of the
[47:33] serpent come to you in your
[47:39] life how did Sin what is
[47:44] sin and and
[47:47] what the
[47:49] word today they don't believe the
[47:52] Bible oh man has interpreted it so many
[47:55] times
[47:58] you can't trust
[48:00] it but what they don't
[48:03] realize that God is big
[48:07] enough to keep his own
[48:10] word that's why when God told Moses I'm
[48:12] going to make you
[48:15] great I'm going to make you greater than
[48:17] them I'm going to take away the
[48:18] inheritance from
[48:22] them and I'm going to make you the main
[48:25] guy
[48:28] he knew better than
[48:31] that because he stood in the
[48:34] bridge and brother Benham
[48:36] said this was the first time that God
[48:40] truly listened to the voice of a
[48:46] man Moses said don't destroy
[48:50] them have mercy upon
[48:54] them show that you are a great God
[48:58] so that you can bring them all the way
[49:01] into the promised
[49:05] land oh he knew how God was
[49:10] great he knew God kept his
[49:14] word Jeremiah 1112
[49:17] says heever hasten over his word
[49:27] to bring it to
[49:29] pass oh what does that mean to you and
[49:32] me
[49:34] tonight that means he's more eager to
[49:37] fulfill his
[49:41] word than we are for him to fulfill
[49:45] it and if he hastens and watches over
[49:49] his
[49:51] word make sure that it fell into our
[49:54] hands
[49:57] in a pure
[49:59] form so that he could stand up and
[50:02] say heaven and earth will pass
[50:06] away but this my words will never pass
[50:11] away this my word will judge you at the
[50:15] last
[50:17] day how could he judge us if his word
[50:19] was not in a pure
[50:23] form and why did God send a prophet like
[50:27] unto Moses in this
[50:32] time stand in the bridge just like Moses
[50:35] did
[50:37] here when God was ready to just
[50:40] eradicate the whole human
[50:43] race there was a man that had Christ in
[50:48] him in the office of the prophet of the
[50:52] age to stand because he saw that there
[50:56] was a a
[50:58] bride that had come forth from the very
[51:02] spiritual gen of
[51:07] God that's why brother never tried to
[51:09] raise himself
[51:12] up I'm just your
[51:15] brother nobody
[51:18] great it's not about
[51:20] me it's not about you it's about him
[51:26] in us notice that not just
[51:30] him but it's about him in
[51:35] you he can't lose one of
[51:38] you he loses one of you he loses part of
[51:46] himself praise the Lord
[51:50] Jesus that's not in the notes that's
[51:54] okay what else is new
[51:58] now remember in our last
[52:02] message on the complex of
[52:06] humanity we went into
[52:10] justification and we found
[52:13] out that when we're
[52:16] justified by
[52:18] faith in the finished works of
[52:23] Calvary God cuts off our past
[52:29] sin could we put up the first picture up
[52:32] there for me
[52:33] please the ones we used last
[52:36] time once again my art is not that
[52:40] good but you get the
[52:43] point and that's a
[52:45] heart that's the heart of the
[52:48] Sinners it's all full of those that
[52:51] those black dots represent of all the
[52:52] sin and mistakes and everything that
[52:55] we've done wrong in our life
[53:02] but that guy in the middle
[53:06] there that Fallen
[53:09] nature that serpent that inter wol
[53:12] himself into you and
[53:16] me because the iniquity of our fathers
[53:19] and
[53:23] forefathers went from one generation to
[53:26] the next generation to the Next
[53:30] Generation and as the scripture
[53:32] says my mother conceived me in
[53:36] iniquity I came into the world speaking
[53:40] lies to begin with you didn't have a
[53:45] chance you were lost I was
[53:48] lost I was in this condition as an
[53:51] unbeliever that's what a sinner
[53:55] is because I didn't even know what God's
[53:58] word had to say about his plan for my
[54:06] life looks looks very Bleak doesn't
[54:11] it give me the next
[54:15] picture oh when you repent and are
[54:19] baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus
[54:24] Christ you are Justified
[54:28] your past sins are cut
[54:32] off and as we heard last time out of
[54:35] future
[54:37] home he just cut off your
[54:41] sin now he didn't cut off the trail of
[54:44] the serpent
[54:46] yet we got to we got to take this a step
[54:48] at a
[54:50] time we were Justified we found out that
[54:53] was to be declared innocent
[55:00] by the blood of the
[55:03] Lamb that when God looks at us through
[55:05] the red
[55:08] blood through our Crimson
[55:12] sin red through red is
[55:16] white he does not see our sin
[55:21] anymore he declares us Innocent by the
[55:25] sufficient sacrifice of
[55:30] calary and brother says you're you're
[55:34] Justified it is as though you never
[55:38] sinned to begin
[55:42] with I I want you to catch that real
[55:44] good do you knew people my precious
[55:47] brother got baptized
[55:49] Sunday welcome my dear
[55:51] brother oh you're just beginning my
[55:54] brother yes
[55:56] it's it's going to get gooder and
[56:00] good it's going to get better and better
[56:03] as the days go
[56:05] by notice as though you never
[56:09] sinned but brother benam says even
[56:12] though he forgave your sin cut off your
[56:17] sins the thing that made you do it is
[56:20] still in
[56:24] there that's why it is that as though
[56:26] you never
[56:29] sined because in this part of the
[56:32] process of the new
[56:35] birth there's still a part of you that
[56:42] sins that gets touchy don't
[56:46] it you're
[56:48] Justified but later on as we go through
[56:51] this
[56:54] process we overcome all these
[56:58] complexes do you know what you need to
[57:00] do under
[57:04] justification you say why brother Jimmy
[57:07] jimy because as of
[57:10] yet when you're just
[57:14] Justified you have no literal evidence
[57:20] yet that you have
[57:24] changed there you turned around in your
[57:28] life God called you you had your back to
[57:32] God you were going the way of the enemy
[57:35] wanted you to
[57:36] go you didn't about
[57:39] face you turned your back on Satan and
[57:42] the things of the
[57:45] world get to face
[57:51] God are you with
[57:53] me let's continue
[57:57] the next
[58:00] picture
[58:03] Sanctified before we get into this one I
[58:05] want to go to our next
[58:09] scripture in First
[58:12] Peter amen chapter
[58:17] one and we're going to start with verse
[58:23] one now we all know that this word
[58:30] Sanctified means
[58:32] cleansed and set aside for
[58:37] service but you might say well what does
[58:40] that
[58:42] mean how does that
[58:46] work because under
[58:50] sanctification when you are
[58:53] cleansed and there's no longer any evil
[58:56] spirits or Desires in
[59:01] you you're
[59:05] empty remember how we said that last
[59:09] time and we mentioned the scripture in
[59:12] second Peter last
[59:15] time that says to make your calling and
[59:18] your election
[59:28] sure how many want to make your calling
[59:30] and election
[59:33] sure does anybody remember what we said
[59:36] the calling
[59:41] does he deals with your
[59:47] conscience he get makes you feel bad for
[59:50] your
[59:52] condition for the sin in your life
[59:56] to such a point that you no longer want
[59:58] to be that
[1:00:00] way you're disgusted with the things
[1:00:03] that are in your
[1:00:08] life the trail of the serpent came into
[1:00:12] you through a wrong
[1:00:16] seed through the seed of the
[1:00:19] serpent which is a false word
[1:00:26] amen amen so under cons under making
[1:00:31] your calling
[1:00:34] sure he dealt with your
[1:00:38] conscience and when you got baptized we
[1:00:40] saw in First Peter
[1:00:43] 3 it was an answer of a good
[1:00:49] conscience towards
[1:00:52] God it wasn't there yet God's not there
[1:00:57] yet but it was an
[1:01:00] answer he
[1:01:02] called you
[1:01:03] answered because it was your conscience
[1:01:06] that was woke
[1:01:08] up now you care about your relationship
[1:01:12] with
[1:01:15] God now it hurts you if you disobey
[1:01:19] God it hurts you if you offend your
[1:01:22] brother your sister your wife your
[1:01:24] husband
[1:01:29] before you could have cared
[1:01:32] less but that
[1:01:34] conscience that
[1:01:36] answered proved there was something down
[1:01:40] in that
[1:01:42] Soul it was a germ from the
[1:01:47] beginning oh it wasn't the
[1:01:51] seed because the seed is the word of God
[1:01:56] but it was the spiritual feminine part
[1:01:59] of what you
[1:02:03] are notice how I said
[1:02:06] that spiritually
[1:02:09] speaking you had the spiritual egg of
[1:02:13] the word already predestinated in
[1:02:21] you what you need now is the germ of the
[1:02:25] Holy Ghost
[1:02:28] to dze
[1:02:30] that and bring forth a new
[1:02:34] birth we can go into those things more
[1:02:37] but how many understand how many the
[1:02:39] young people can more or less get
[1:02:41] that there was something in
[1:02:44] you you didn't understand what it was I
[1:02:48] didn't understand what it was when I was
[1:02:49] a 12y old
[1:02:52] boy and I would be about to do something
[1:02:56] and and something would speak to
[1:02:59] me not necessarily an audible
[1:03:02] voice and I would get scared and I would
[1:03:04] go
[1:03:07] home when I got a little older I didn't
[1:03:09] go
[1:03:11] home you know what I mean
[1:03:14] right but it was that it was what
[1:03:17] brother BR called representation by
[1:03:23] predestination because we are a part of
[1:03:26] the feminine part of
[1:03:31] God we are his
[1:03:34] bride later on we'll get into those
[1:03:38] things but now let's go here and see now
[1:03:41] under
[1:03:44] election he's not going to deal with our
[1:03:46] conscience so
[1:03:49] much he's going to deal with our subc
[1:03:53] conscience he's going to deal with our
[1:03:57] soul he's going to dive into our
[1:04:02] soul and he's going to begin to take out
[1:04:05] everything that Satan has put in
[1:04:10] there everything that he has
[1:04:14] perverted because it's a fallen
[1:04:17] nature and how many remember what is the
[1:04:22] soul what is the soul
[1:04:27] the nature of
[1:04:29] what does your
[1:04:33] spirit to you that didn't know what your
[1:04:35] soul was now you
[1:04:39] do praise the Living
[1:04:42] God now how many want to see if you're
[1:04:48] elected not that he's going to elect you
[1:04:50] right
[1:04:52] now how many want to see if you're
[1:04:55] already
[1:05:01] El 1 2 3 oh my
[1:05:05] goodness you don't want to know if
[1:05:07] you're
[1:05:08] elected I tell you when the Great
[1:05:10] Tribulation
[1:05:13] comes I don't want to be
[1:05:15] here you know
[1:05:19] why I don't want to even go there I'll
[1:05:20] lose another 10
[1:05:23] minutes now let's go to the scriptures
[1:05:27] here in first in
[1:05:35] Peter chapter one we going actually
[1:05:37] start with verse
[1:05:41] two elect according to the foreign
[1:05:44] knowledge of God the
[1:05:50] Father through
[1:05:52] sanctification of the spirit and San
[1:06:01] now what's he going to
[1:06:03] do he's going to drive the nature of
[1:06:07] that serpent out of
[1:06:13] you through
[1:06:16] sanctification not to elect
[1:06:19] you but to manifest that election
[1:06:26] you'll never know whether you're elected
[1:06:28] or
[1:06:30] not unless you go through this
[1:06:34] process sanctification of the
[1:06:40] spirits it's the spirit that's taking
[1:06:43] all these filthy desires out of
[1:06:46] you and of
[1:06:49] me he's giving us a new desire he's
[1:06:52] creating in us a new desire
[1:06:57] elected according to the foreign
[1:06:59] knowledge of
[1:07:03] god let's say that
[1:07:06] together
[1:07:07] elected according to the for knowledge
[1:07:10] of
[1:07:12] God do you really believe
[1:07:15] that I believe
[1:07:17] it so no matter what it
[1:07:21] takes I want to make my calling and my
[1:07:24] election sure
[1:07:28] now as he begins to tear me apart come
[1:07:31] on
[1:07:32] now and he begins to dismantle all the
[1:07:36] works of the devil in my
[1:07:39] life now he's going to put me back
[1:07:42] together the way Adam was put
[1:07:49] together oh my I don't want to go
[1:07:52] there and I didn't even notice what time
[1:07:54] we start started
[1:07:56] oh 7:30
[1:07:59] okay
[1:08:00] cuz I used to be
[1:08:04] faster but then I got so fast every
[1:08:07] right oh what did he
[1:08:10] say said a lot of things man
[1:08:14] lost what did you get out of it
[1:08:19] uh oh maybe my old a older age is
[1:08:24] helping me a little bit
[1:08:29] go a little slower so make sure you're
[1:08:30] with me
[1:08:34] right elected to the for knowledge of
[1:08:36] God through sanctification of the spirit
[1:08:39] unto obedience and sprinkling of the
[1:08:43] blood of Jesus Christ Grace unto you and
[1:08:48] peace be multip
[1:09:01] W how many want that that
[1:09:04] Grace to be multiplied
[1:09:08] in you know in Zariah says The Headstone
[1:09:12] shall come
[1:09:15] forth with acclamations of
[1:09:20] grace and grace unto
[1:09:26] in Spanish it says
[1:09:29] her in English it says unto
[1:09:36] it but in Spanish it says unto
[1:09:40] her do you know where the first
[1:09:42] acclamation came forth
[1:09:45] from from
[1:09:47] heaven when the Lord himself descended
[1:09:50] from heaven with a
[1:09:53] shout a message of
[1:09:56] Grace but the other
[1:09:59] Grace was the echo of the grace that was
[1:10:03] in
[1:10:05] heaven and the second acclamation of
[1:10:08] Grace comes forth
[1:10:13] nowto
[1:10:14] you Grace unto
[1:10:18] her unto the
[1:10:21] bride oh now it's answering back
[1:10:26] PE Grace unto
[1:10:30] her aren't you happy for that
[1:10:38] grace verse
[1:10:40] three blessed be the God and father of
[1:10:44] our Lord Jesus Christ which according to
[1:10:47] His abundant Mercy hath begotten us
[1:10:52] again unto a lively hope
[1:10:55] by the resurrection of Jesus Christ from
[1:10:59] the
[1:11:10] dead I want to switch to Spanish
[1:11:13] here because it says it different in
[1:11:16] English and it does in
[1:11:23] Spanish when it says to uh beget us
[1:11:27] again
[1:11:32] again our our first
[1:11:35] uh
[1:11:39] begotten when we're born of our father
[1:11:41] and
[1:11:44] mother in holy
[1:11:49] matrimony we know we come formed in
[1:11:53] iniquity but now in
[1:11:58] sanctification when the heart is now
[1:12:03] clean when your spirit is now
[1:12:08] clean now the
[1:12:11] word the word can be begotten inside of
[1:12:14] your
[1:12:16] heart and that will bring a
[1:12:20] regeneration when the Holy
[1:12:24] Spirit quickens that
[1:12:27] word that is begotten in your
[1:12:31] heart that's what begins to
[1:12:35] cut the trail of the
[1:12:37] serpent that begins to cut it off right
[1:12:44] there it doesn't come by that trail
[1:12:46] anymore did you get
[1:12:48] it how many
[1:12:50] times have you seen people come to the
[1:12:53] Lord
[1:12:55] they give their heart to the
[1:12:57] Lord
[1:12:59] baptized and after a
[1:13:04] while what
[1:13:07] happens they go back and do some of the
[1:13:10] things they did
[1:13:12] before does that condemn
[1:13:15] them are we going to just kick them and
[1:13:18] kick them
[1:13:20] out no we're going to pick them
[1:13:24] up
[1:13:26] realized that the trail of the
[1:13:30] serpent that came through their
[1:13:33] life that came through their
[1:13:36] genealogy that came through their family
[1:13:40] tree still hasn't been
[1:13:44] destroyed it still hasn't been cast out
[1:13:47] of the human
[1:13:51] heart you got to die I got to die
[1:13:56] to that old
[1:13:57] nature under
[1:14:00] justification let's go back as we
[1:14:03] approach
[1:14:06] sanctification the hardest thing it will
[1:14:08] be for you to do my
[1:14:10] brother and my sister is to believe what
[1:14:14] God's word says about
[1:14:18] you more than what you know about
[1:14:22] yourself
[1:14:28] that's the whole
[1:14:29] thing that all depends whether it ever
[1:14:32] comes to where the Serpent's Trail can
[1:14:35] be cut
[1:14:38] off and all the curses that have come
[1:14:40] upon
[1:14:42] you that have come upon your
[1:14:45] family you can be regenerated
[1:15:00] wow getting awful milk here
[1:15:05] here verse
[1:15:08] four to an inheritance Incorruptible and
[1:15:15] undefiled and that fth not
[1:15:20] away reserved in the heaven for you
[1:15:26] it's reserved in
[1:15:27] heaven I ask what
[1:15:32] heaven you get
[1:15:34] it Heavenly places in Christ
[1:15:38] Jesus I just don't want to visit there
[1:15:40] once in a
[1:15:42] while I want to learn how to live
[1:15:48] there in heaven he's preserved it he's
[1:15:52] preserved it
[1:15:55] Greek word
[1:15:56] says to such a place it'll never Escape
[1:16:03] you how can it Escape
[1:16:06] you if you're following the plan of God
[1:16:09] for your
[1:16:12] life give me that first
[1:16:22] quote amen
[1:16:25] out of the message revelation of Jesus
[1:16:30] Christ after he laid his hands upon
[1:16:34] them talking about the apostles
[1:16:37] here they were then after being saved
[1:16:40] and Sanctified they were filled with the
[1:16:42] Holy
[1:16:47] Ghost
[1:16:49] water
[1:16:50] blood spirit there are three that agree
[1:16:54] in your Earth I'm going to say it that
[1:16:58] way if you say three agree on Earth
[1:17:00] which
[1:17:02] Earth your
[1:17:05] Earth they agree in
[1:17:08] one they are not one you can be
[1:17:12] justified without being
[1:17:15] Sanctified you can be Sanctified without
[1:17:17] being filled with the Holy
[1:17:20] Ghost
[1:17:22] one must born of the
[1:17:26] water and of the
[1:17:30] spirit and that's not water baptism
[1:17:33] excuse
[1:17:34] me be a type of it I'm not saying
[1:17:36] anything against that it's the
[1:17:40] water washing of the Water by
[1:17:45] word the only way you're going to
[1:17:47] believe more what God says about
[1:17:52] you once you're Justified
[1:17:55] is to be constantly feeding yourself the
[1:17:58] word of God every day of your life not
[1:18:01] on Wednesday not just Sunday you are
[1:18:05] walking in the word every
[1:18:07] day the only way
[1:18:11] you're to believe what God says you
[1:18:16] are and you're not going to do that just
[1:18:18] on
[1:18:20] Wednesday oh what we get on Wednesday
[1:18:22] and Sunday

[1:18:31] have is he really the pastor no it's the
[1:18:34] Holy Ghost in
[1:18:36] him but he's using that

[1:20:57] blood that he might cleanse us from our
[1:21:00] sexual

[1:29:30] Living
[1:29:35] Word to bring us back to Jesus

[1:29:44] Bible that's what the message

[1:30:01] want to go to the
[1:30:05] next they believe
[1:30:08] it they've accepted it there's something
[1:30:12] happened to them they become a new
[1:30:17] creature a new
[1:30:19] creature a new
[1:30:21] being a new creature
[1:30:24] there's the Greek word that says New
[1:30:31] Creation are you a new
[1:30:34] creation amen amen one last qu will be
[1:30:42] done it's a new
[1:30:45] creation you have been
[1:30:48] recreated
[1:30:52] again oh my
[1:30:54] no wonder this old natural birth no more
[1:30:57] drag you go all over the
[1:31:00] place wonder why this old birth old
[1:31:03] nature can no longer drag you all over
[1:31:06] the
[1:31:09] place because he has recreated
[1:31:14] you again from what you
[1:31:18] were the image of a Son of
[1:31:22] God and a daughter of of God it's just
[1:31:26] such an it's the greatest miracle that
[1:31:30] that ever
[1:31:33] happened when a sinner can be made to
[1:31:37] become a
[1:31:40] Christian what's the greatest
[1:31:43] Miracle when you're recreated
[1:31:48] regenerated that's why water baptism
[1:31:51] does not regenerate
[1:31:54] it remits your
[1:31:56] sins it sends them back to the
[1:31:59] originator of what made the
[1:32:04] sin letter comes to your house with
[1:32:07] somebody else's name on
[1:32:10] [Music]
[1:32:12] it live here
[1:32:14] anymore remit it back to
[1:32:18] him but now under
[1:32:21] regeneration he seals the deal he
[1:32:24] recreates
[1:32:28] you and this is what cuts off the trail
[1:32:32] of the
[1:32:34] serpent he's not going to be buzzing
[1:32:36] around like a beer with no
[1:32:39] Stinger because he lost that finger when
[1:32:42] he put it into Christ brother
[1:32:45] Bren oh he can make a lot of
[1:32:48] noise he can try to bring up things of
[1:32:50] your own life
[1:32:54] you what in the world are you talking
[1:32:57] about I don't
[1:33:00] remember people say well you cannot
[1:33:02] forgive and
[1:33:05] forget are you sure about
[1:33:09] that well I was in charge of the mission
[1:33:13] here 30 years ago
[1:33:16] whatever all the people were
[1:33:19] new my wife would sometimes see some of
[1:33:22] the things the brothers did to me
[1:33:27] and she would come tell me how can you
[1:33:28] let him get away with
[1:33:31] that and I go honey they're they're
[1:33:35] they're new
[1:33:37] honey don't be
[1:33:39] born one of these days they won't do it
[1:33:43] again oh I already forgave
[1:33:46] them and I already forgot about
[1:33:48] it and I'm going to treat them as though
[1:33:51] they never did it to begin
[1:33:56] I love the
[1:33:57] people do you love the
[1:34:00] people once you're
[1:34:03] regenerated and the Holy Ghost enthrones
[1:34:06] itself in that little room in your
[1:34:13] heart that trail of the serpent the Holy
[1:34:17] Spirit comes
[1:34:20] in and he blows out loud
[1:34:27] and he
[1:34:29] erases the trail of the
[1:34:34] serpent now if the serpent wants to come
[1:34:36] through
[1:34:38] there he can't even find his own
[1:34:44] trail Lord Jesus we thank you Lord as we
[1:34:46] stand to our
[1:34:48] feet there's much more that could be
[1:34:50] said

[1:35:27] things because we are made up of the
[1:35:30] miracle working
[1:35:34] God how could we not believe in
[1:35:37] miracles when our new birth is a
[1:35:42] miracle about God's nature is
