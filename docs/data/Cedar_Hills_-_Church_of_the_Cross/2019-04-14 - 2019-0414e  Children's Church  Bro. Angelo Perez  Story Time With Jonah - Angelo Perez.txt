everybody hi you guys Ison and dressed think I should have came in something a little nicer all I had so anyway you guys could be seated Oh put this this chair here you guys know I've been at the depths of the sea or three days three nights I think there's a brother Angelo in here yeah brother Angelo come up can you please all by your heads did like I should said how many father we come before you asking that you can't be with us today Lloyd highest like you can just send your nose down to camp around each and every one of us would like I said you can bless the children and I say you can go me third my sister did for them today and just let me pray amen that was a fine oh my I say you can open your Bibles to isaiah 53:5 whenever you're having any same in but he was wondered for our transgressions and he was sorry he was bruised for our iniquities the translations of our peace was upon him and with His stripes we are healed before I begin I would like to thank the Lord and all my brothers and sisters for prank for me and I I just got I don't like you know we say gee in my throat I would like to talk about God's healing power today how how many here believe in healing amen God has yet God has guard every huge healed you God is the only one who can heal not a man only God whenever I was just a baby I was sick and ended up in the hospital for a couple of weeks I was born with a just order called the meckel's diverticulum which means a the end of my stomach and in the beginning of my intestines were knotted up together causing a blockage and was deadly my mom didn't find out until I was 10 months old the doctor who diagnosed me said one in a million people were diagnosed with this disorder every year I was rushed to a possible Children's Hospital and immediately on underwent to Sergey and I and to remove the not a few days later the in it where they fixed it up it reopened and I and on the inside and again I underwent so I need to close it back up and so you can put up the pictures up there for me the next one that kid right there he was good-looking even though he was sick I'm thankful to the Lord for completely healing me from that to this day I have never suffered from that disorder see so sometimes we get sick so God can manifest his glory but we were all born sick because the Bible tells us that we are born in sin and shaped in in in in sorry and that we comment to the world speaking lies so we need God to heal us it did it it doesn't matter how good you are we still need medicine which is God in our hearts in second kings five there was a character in the Bible named naman and he too sick he was sent to Elisha the prophet a prophet is the mouthpiece of God the Prophet sent him too instructions for his healing but when he heard the extractions of the prophet sends him he was angered because he was not expecting to what to hear that he was the you when you he was wanting his miracle but God would rather heal his children then give them a miracle because a miracle it take you know you don't have to believe God does it and killing it take it you have to believe in it in order for you to get healed so that's what man had to do we have to do is thank you and God bless you [Applause] now I need all of the little children they could come up and sit right around here it's going to be storytime with Jonah all right perfect oh you guys don't fit perfect careful and I'm gonna fall all righty I pretty much just give it away but how many of you can guess who I am John John Jonas right my name is Jonah and I'm the son of Emmett I does anyone here know my story you good heard my story before yeah you have my story my book I wrote a book Wow okay well to start I am a prophet of the Lord but there's something different about me than all the other prophets and we're gonna get into that a little bit here I'm here to share with you my experience what I went through some pretty nasty things it smelt really fishy for three days and three nights I did so to start there was a day when God's voice came to me and he said Jonah I have a job for you to do there's a city called Nineveh and their wickedness mommy knows what wickedness is that evil yeah exactly so I said this city is wicked and it's come up before me I need you to go and cry out against it this city was full of people doing bad things instead of serving God all they wanted to do was watch TV or play video games or talk back to their parents yeah does that sound familiar no oh yeah I thought so I thought it does often movie Oh exactly yeah okay and my only job my only job it was simple was just to go cry out against it sorry my mustache keeps falling that's simple right God calls you to cry out against something doesn't that sound so simple okay Lord I'll cry out against it my children I made a great great mistake I mean owes my mistake that I made oh I didn't want to go that's exactly right I did so I fled from the presence of God when I heard his voice I just I couldn't do it said no Lord I can't do it and I found a ship that was leaving this place so I even paid money yeah I paid money to get on the ship and I left I don't want to be nowhere near the presence of God yeah I did but kids let me tell you something very very true if you remember anything from this story remember this if you ever do anything wrong you talk bad about someone or you do maybe something you're not supposed to do just remember until you make it right you'll never be able to run away from it take it from me I tried running from the Lord but it didn't work yeah exactly he knows everything and he always sees you because he's God that's right so God knew exactly where I was and he made sure to get ahold of me does anyone here have their Bible yeah okay yes oh no I didn't have fun okay do you want to read from me Jonah one for you learn to read it out of mine I'm gonna read it out of mine one for right there but the Lord sent out a great wind into the sea and there was a my mighty am tempest in the sea so the ship was like to be broken yes sir that's right so what happened was to get a hold of me the Lord knew who I was I was on this ship I fled I paid money to get out of there and I was being disobedient so the Lord he sent a mighty wind and these winds were strong I was in the middle of the ocean the waves as tall as his building maybe even taller everything was just going mad the ship was getting full of water it was gonna sink everyone was grabbing everything they can to throw it off of the ship so we wouldn't sink but guess where I was at the whole time now I was sleeping at the bottom of the ship that doesn't sound too good I know yeah I didn't say there were sharks eh I bet there were sharks in there so when I was asleep the captain of the ship he came down to where I was he said hey you sleepyhead call upon your God so he can remember us and we can be saved yeah and I woke up and the crew found out and they started asking me questions said what's your job when did you even get on the ship where am i from whose people do you belong to so I stood up and I said I'm a Hebrew and I fear the Lord the God of heaven the same one that created this sea and the dry land and I told him that I was running from his presence and when I did they all got really scared they knew hey you don't mess with the Lord Jesus mm-hmm you don't mess with God and said why did you do this what could we do to make the ocean and the Seas and the winds what can we do to make them calm down so we don't get hurt and I stood up I said throw me into the waters this is all my fault because of me you all might die but throw me overboard in the the waters will calm down you see it was me that God wanted God didn't want any of them or he wasn't after any of them but he was after me yeah I do any of you guys have siblings at home like brothers and sisters yeah you have a brother so let me ask you a question when you get in trouble at home sometimes does it make your brother and sister get in trouble too yeah when you do something bad and then your brother or sister winds up in the mess too yeah and I remember when I was little yeah my parents would spank me and then my sister and my brother would cry too just because I was crying so that's what happened here I got in big trouble and because of my disobedience and because of me not wanting to listen to God everyone else around me was in the same mess and I don't want that do you guys want your brothers and sisters to be in trouble with you all the time No so they casted me into the water and immediately the water stopped calm down the waves just fell everything was calm but before they casted me in we know my brother branham that they tied my ankles they bound me by my feet they bound me by my hands and then they throw me into the water and we weren't on the shore by a beach with ice cream cones on the side I was in the middle of the ocean no clouds it was hot so I started to just float there in the water and guess what God was doing this whole time he was creating a fish a big fish yeah it was like a whale and this fish and it came and swallowed me up you know what if it went when a fish eats you know what it does after it eats it digest and it goes all the way to the bottom and it just sits there and it digests whatever it just ate so that's where I was at all because I didn't want to listen I was in the belly of a big fish well and I was at the bottom of the ocean pitched back no light it was dark it was cold it was clammy and it's not like fish really bad I didn't eat no fish new fish I think hmm so I was in the belly of this fish for three days and for three nights this whole time just looking around all I could see was the belly of this fish so I started to feel in my heart I knew I was wrong so I started to cry out I said Lord everywhere I look all I see is the belly of this fish and I know I've done wrong here here my sincerity forgive me Lord and that my prayer God heard my sincerity he heard that that I knew I was wrong I said but let me look to your holy temple one more time and I'm looking to his holy temple and God heard me he heard my heart and the fish came back up to shore and yeah he threw up and I guess what came out I came out of the fish's mouth with all throw-up so that was pretty much my story not to get into too much details I want to hold you guys too long but I do have some goodie bags and I have questions to see if everyone was listening all right first question what did God call me to do let's see to cry out against the city of nineveh for the wickedness good job errors for you alright I have a second question what was my big mistake ladies Sophie that you said no no to the whole day I said no and I wanted to run away from him right yeah good job there you go all right I have a third question for the guys this time what people did I come from Hebrews good job there you go fourth question for the ladies what happened after I was thrown into the water yeah the Seas calmed and I was swallowed by a will good job there's yours and for the last and final question now in order to answer this question I have to see hear you say hallelujah the loudest you can and then I'll pick you to answer the question okay all right right after I asked the question hi Julia and the loudest one gets the answer okay how long was I in the belly of the whale oh my goodness that was great but I don't think I heard one I'll give it to you three days and three nights where you go well

around through each other you guys can get one out of the bag and while we do that we just want to recap on the story so Jonah was a prophet of the Lord right and he was called to cry out against what the wicked city of Nineveh right and so what did Jonah do that was wrong yeah he ran away from the presence of the Lord exactly does anyone know where he was headed to he was where yeah he was headed to a ship but he was headed to the city of Tarsus okay so because of Jonah because of his disobedience was he the only one that was getting in trouble for it no everyone around him was also right the whole crew was getting in trouble for him too how long was he in the belly of the whale for three days and three nights all right how about can we say hallelujah one more time can we say I Love You
