========================================

now tonight we are studying this uh second seal and it for the first four seals there is four harsh riders then i grab me a pencil right quick and start writing down as fast as i can while he's there he's doing something real supernatural now too so we're just expecting great things now i'll read the third verse now and when he had opened the second seal i heard the second beast say come and see and there i went out another horse fourth verse that was red and power was given to him that set thereon to take peace from the earth that they should kill one another and they should kill one another and there was given unto him a great sword and he didn't see what it was he just saw a symbol and that symbol for the reason it was he said come see but he saw a symbol that he was to symbolize it to the church and remember the secrets was to be revealed in the last day and how does he reveal his word his secrets the bible notice the first church when the catholic church says that they were the first original church they're exactly right they were they began at pentecost that's where the catholic church began i once didn't hardly believe that i read history and i found out it's right now let's go to the second season [Music] when the slain risen lamb opened it and the second uh calf-like beast said come see what the seal mystery is now we get it the lamb remember has to open every seal the second first was a line the next was a was a was it like a calf or a ox or something we find here that he saw what a red horse go forward let's just read and see what he says here and there went out the fourth verse there went out another horse that was red the first and swine and power was given unto him that set their own to take peace from the earth and they should kill one another and there was given him a great sword now this symbol here and we want to look at him real close let us now consider what john saw then of these things what he saw a red horse and his rider goes forth power given to him to slay with a great sword now here's my revelation this is satan again it's a devil again in another form now we know that that um seals pertained as i said the other night and trumpets pertain to to civil wars you see amongst the people among nations but you find out here that this man has a sword so he pertains to church political war you might not think that but just watch in a minute notice the change of color of these horses same rider change of color of horses and a horse is a beast and the beast in the bible and her symbol represents a power the same system riding on another color power from the innocent white to a bloody red see watch him now it's coming when he first started he was just uh well he's just a little doctor to get a much closer nicoladianism of course it wouldn't slay anything that's revelation 2 6 if you want to put it down then after while he was given a crown because you can't put a crown on his spirit's edge but when this spirit become incarnate the second work of his of his dispensation of his missing the second word he become a crowned false prophet to the working of the antichrist spirit now we see him now he becomes that when he takes that then he uh is already satan controls the political powers of the world now he gets into a place that he's going to make a universal church power taking religious power and do you not understand my brothers that in when this nation appears in the 13th chapter of revelation this little animal raised up like a lamb and it's got two horns civil and ecclesiastical power but he done the same thing the beast did before now when he did that he did not have the ecclesiastical power yet but he started him with a demon of a false teaching and that teaching become a doctrine that doctrine become incarnate in a false prophet and then he went just to the right place he never went to israel now he went to rome now i see a room the council was held and they elected a head bishop amen and then by doing this they united church and stayed together then he dropped his bowl he got off his white horse he got on his red horse or he can kill anybody that don't agree with him [Music] there's your seal same watch him right on into eternity see unites both his powers together now we find out he unites his power then when he become both state and church the ecclesiastical then what are you going to do he farms his own religion and now he can do whatever he wants to that he has a right to putt to death whosoever will not agree with him that's exactly what he did too amen he went back down to hippo and he was the very one that signed that paper that had the revelation from god that it was all right and pleasing god to put every person to death that didn't believe with the roman catholic church now listen i'm quoting from the mortality from the timeless of saint augustine of hippo until 15 and 86 on the roman mortarology the roman catholic church put 68 million protestants today [Music] was his sword red was it ride a red horse what was it the same power the same rider amen there's the seal they admit 68 million on the mortarology besides all those put to death outside of that oh mercy during the dark ages there were millions fed the lions and slaughtered that way because they wouldn't bow down to that catholic doctrine now let me say something brother there's something fixing to happen and all these big old ecclesiastical walls are going to collapse and go right back over honor and agree because you're go to good as certain as i'm standing here there's an image to that beast it's a certain as i'm standing you're in this nation talking according to the word of the law listen when you feel that little funny feeling you get away from them walls get away you'll die there don't do it come out of it get away from all this stuff leave the safety as quick as you can ask come for mercy that's power hit heavenly father oh i i just sometimes lord stand urine and i tremble i think that awful hour that's approaching and uh there's no way to stop it it's predicted it would come now i thought of why don't the people come and and listen and what they come and accept it but of course i know that that you said they wouldn't so they won't but there is some that's got their names written on the lamb's book of life and when them seals are thrown over there they see their name there and the holy spirit speaks to them they come you can't keep them away no one can no one we we want you to search our hearts if there's anything wrong lord let us know now please don't let us come to that hour not everyone is too late search me try the lord we want to be able with that mysterious thunder thunders out honor and the church is taken up we want to be ready to receive it lord grant him granted i pray that god will give you this charge in jesus christ's name
