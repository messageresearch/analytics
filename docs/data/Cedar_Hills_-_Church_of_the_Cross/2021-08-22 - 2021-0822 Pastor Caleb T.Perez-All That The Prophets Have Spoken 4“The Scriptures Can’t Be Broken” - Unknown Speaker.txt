little bit more we get what we get don't throw fit what we know how to do is just work work work and sometimes we forget how necessary it is to spend some time with the family anxiety anxiety and pressures and moods a lot of people don't don't don't see thankful to god for my wife and and my family that have stood there with me all these years we had such a wonderful time together we thank you i thank the lord for that and thank each one of you for being here gracias your prayers your finances everything that you do for the kingdom of god thank you this morning may god bless you for all your efforts i think somebody said it was brother isaac's birthday today god bless you amen on your birthday also amen that's good old billy now billy some of you don't know billy amen well let's get right into the word now and we are at number four of all that the prophets have spoken with the subtitle the scriptures cannot be broken the scriptures cannot be broken luke 24 25 can i get a couple of the microphones for the for the young people as we're having we'll have the young people read a couple of the scriptures and then we'll we will uh we will uh end up just jumping in and reading the rest of them but just to get a little help from the from the young people luke 24 25 and then over here john 10 35 okay amen go ahead then he said unto them go fools and slow apart to believe all that the prophets have spoken fools and slow of heart to believe all that the prophets have spoken go ahead if he called them gods unto whom the word of god came and the scripture cannot be broken and the scripture cannot be broken may god add his blessings to the reading of his word you may be seated my my mother my mother had such a respect sometimes the bible might be on the side and we might be drinking something and we put it on the bible sometimes we'll get a book and we'll just throw it out there and sometimes it might land on top of the bible oh [Music] young people don't ever put anything on top of your bibles how many of you believe that the bible is infallible amen can i get an amen this morning we believe that the bible is infallible we believe we don't believe that there's any mistakes in the bible can i get a witness there are no contradictions in the bible there are no errors in the bible this is god in print form and that's why we look at the scripture we can simply say the scriptures cannot be broken [Music] i want you to hold your bible up those of you that brought your bible young people you brought your bibles all right making there is so much power that lays in these holy scriptures there is power in these holy scriptures [Applause] and we understand that what we're trying to accomplish here this morning and through the years we're trying to get the word into the heart if that's why i always tell you it is your duty to get the word inside of you read the book it's your duty to get the word inside of it brother branham quotes matthew 17 5. and the last few words this is my beloved son [Music] hear ye him the last three words is hear ye can you repeat that after me young people repeat that hear ye him one more time hear ye him amen brother branham says that those three words would be enough to send a revival all the way around the world and save every did you get that he he's not even saying the whole bible he said just those three words i want you to say it together hear ye him those three words once again is enough to send a revival all the way around the world if there is that much power in those three words then how about the whole scripture what would it do to your world that is why it is impossible for the scriptures to ever be broken listen closely now you can read it but continue though in the things which thou has learned and has been assured of knowing whom thou has learned them no i want to stop there knowing it says of whom thou has learned them because everybody's preaching from this bible right but knowing whom and thou from a child thou has known the holy scriptures the holy scriptures you've known them from a child which are able to make these wise unto salvation through christ through faith which is incorrect christ jesus through the holy scriptures they're able all scripture is given by inspiration of god and is profitable for doctrine of reproof for correction for instruction in righteousness verse 17. that the man of god may be perfect through in it and to the good work truly furnished unto all good works and if the prophets this is the message jesus christ the same yesterday today and forever and if the prophets he says jeremiah isaiah elisha if they had thus saith the lord as long as they have the word to did not the scripture say that they amen watch this now because he done the announcing he took the [Music] that the scriptures cannot be broken if jesus said the works that i do shall you do also that can't be broken uh i don't know i don't know if i'm talking to you to anybody today the works that i do shall you do also there is a people that will do the same works that he did as they know okay and the world sees if the bible said that jesus christ is the same yesterday today and forever that can't be broken either then he has to be the same principle and i tell you this morning and so is the son of god sending forth his spirit in these last days that his scriptures cannot be broken every that's the reason that we can place all our faith in the scriptures the catholic church believes that's just satan trying to break the scriptures and i'm here to tell you it's impossible it's impossible to tell your neighbor it's impossible to break the scriptures watch am i going to heaven boy i asked all of you this morning are you going to heaven brother branham says sure i am this is a minor adams he goes to void they say why because the scriptures can't be broken [Music] [Applause] [Music] okay are you going to heaven gentlemen over here why are you going to heaven that's right because the scriptures can't be broken are you going to heaven why because you're good because we never make a mistake or because the scriptures can't be broken amen it is written in the scriptures you're not little flock not amazed your [Music] and in our text jesus he's coming from jerusalem come on church not even this morning can he do anything jesus of two thousand years ago now watch now the people thought he would he would be praying for all these thousands of sick people but he said until the father showed him first what to do john 5 listen closely to this it wasn't given to him just to take the blessings of god and throw them out any which way he wished that's how many people serve the lord today even as ministers oh yeah just just throw out the blessings to whoever it wasn't given to him to do it that way and he said verily verily i say unto thee that god from his lips jesus said when he was here on earth can't be broken and that's why he said you destroyed this body the same reason that you and i should have that confidence neither will i suffer thy holy one to seek corruption that was the scripture gave him the confidence yes you put this down david said i will not suffer my holy one to seek corruption he knew the scripture pertained to him the scripture rarely do you find anyone that believes in god no more oh i don't believe the message no more everybody's doing their own thing it's just a free-for-all world as we look at this he knew that within 72 hours his body would be raised again i can see jesus getting whipped and that's why many people today how hard it is to was the same father that went with him [Applause] i can what a confident church we are the word bride this is someone we shall have the same confidence watch this now because the scriptures cannot be broken the word of god from the mouth of his holy prophets when he died the resurrecting power was already inside of him come here brother aaron all right brother david move this for a moment bring that chair here he comes into the tomb and he knows el salvade what all the scriptures were spoken about him he had in him when he went down the power of the resurrection power in him because i am the resurrection but there was something that kept him in the grave or he would have resurrected just like that what was it that was holding him but you know what kept him in the grave for that long time i don't know sometimes if we understand the power of the scripture the scripture is what kept him there but the scripture is also what releases that when before 72 hours would come the scripture then said [Applause] what [Music] when there is a release that's why satan wants to do it what he's always trying to do is break scripture this whole thing is even if you could just break one little period i don't think you got it again he just has to remove one little iota yeah why he tries to break them by sowing seeds of doubt he tries to break them by saying that there are contradictions in there he tries to break them by saying oh they were just men and he goes on and on let me tell you this morning church that not even god can break the scriptures did you get i'm going to say it again not even god can break the scriptures because then it would be he would be breaking his john the jews answered saying for a good work we stoned thee not but for blasphemy and because of that thou being a man make this thyself god i'm gonna i'm just going to read it in english just to save time jesus answered them is it not written in your law i said he are gods jesus is telling them i'm the one that said it i don't know if you cut that or not i'm going to read it again jesus and answered them is it not written in your law i said what a scripture when you stop for a moment and here he is jesus standing there a man are you getting it are you getting the bride's doctrine that's where we ended last time if you remember we received a scriptural word prophet therefore we are to be a scriptural word church knows that he cannot deceive this price and the scriptures and not be broken when the scripture says the scripture is never broken i want you to understand that the scripture is never broken in your life he will try to break the continuity of it keep it from getting to you when it says honor your father and mother the scripture says honor your father and mother and you don't you know the continuity of the scriptures is broken that's why nothing goes right for me because everybody wants to be the one look at those kids the mystery of the seven stars [Applause] but we get into those things because this continuity of the scripture has been broken we talk about the perfecting of the saints without a fightful ministry you've broken [Music] you see once again the scriptures cannot be broken but the continuity of the scripture in your life is what is broken in the message straight is the gate and he would attach knowing the scriptures and he would put it together with the power of god you do air not knowing the scriptures he says they know them in their own book of learning in their catechisms they noted in their theology but jesus said you don't know you don't know the scriptures then neither do you know the power how incredible it is as he puts that together this morning brother and sister let us not fall what is the bride's doctrine is but the continuity of the word the unchanging continuity of god's word and his words he never changes he never changes his ways no canvas the scripture is in perfect continuity everything that god does is in continuity with what he done is the first time that he uses that phrase word right the mysterious writer watch what he does listen closely that's going to help you oppose refuse to repent and go back to the original blood word the word became blood and flesh this is where you're supposed to fit in how many how many i mean everybody's done done puzzles right you know when you get a piece that just doesn't go there and you're trying to force it in and it doesn't go always trying to force ourselves into that puzzle why are we always trying to force ourselves into the things of the world we were made to fit in there you're trying to break the continuity of the scriptures where do you fit yeah in the mystical body of the lord jesus we are members of that body members in particular remembers in particular oh watch what he says here you see he's against her he forms his own bride called the antichrist by an antichrist teaching contrary to christ oh see how shrewd he is the antichrist refuses the true bright doctrine of she becomes will it's happening tomorrow it's happening right now [Applause] [Applause] now when the word comes forth listen closely because it starts out as a mental thing a mental conception in the mind and then the enthusiasts must drop to your heart and become a divine faith a divine revelation but i'm going to shock you with this forever learning but that is the mark of the beast the same word though because you're rejecting it maybe not by your mind but you rejected it with your heart says the soul that sin is it becomes a divine faith and i keep on going just for a little bit more okay you haven't heard me in a little while so it's ongoing what happened the word came into your mind i know the bible hostel thessalonians 2 13. let's read it from up there for this cause also thank you god without ceasing because when he received the word of god because when you received the word of god which he heard of us which he heard from who us oh this is paul talking he received it as as not as he received it not not as the world of men but as oh hold on hold on there's a lot here you can read it because when you receive the word of god which you heard of us what you received it not as word of man speaking it's not a massive the word of god which effectually worketh also in you that believe oh the word of god that work is effectual it's got enough depth in it the tree of life that comes from god out of heaven and if a man eats this he never dies then when he went away he purchased a bride tree yeah and that tree was established and putting in the roots of the earth the day of pentecost was give for nearly 2 000 years wait wait till we get to this part for he got a piece off of himself oh it's just the new testament we have the old and the new yeah he fulfilled the old testament [Music] yes but no i don't know if there's anybody in it part of the bride here maybe there's a lot of church this morning but now i'm talking to the bride that you're part of the bride we'll fulfill everything he does it by his what a challenge to us the works that i do shall you do also la soros christianity has been represented to you in the form of doctrine in the form of doctrine and pamphlets and in bible and i am foreign god help those missionaries that go there to live there questions [Applause] this god it's in word only but the god that wrote that word that you've already got placed in your heart has now come to a place when they saw a living god [Music] but we want to keep on going a little bit more we don't have service this afternoon let's go for a little while longer [Music] amen the continuity of the scriptures must not be broken i'm going to skip some of this stuff because i want to i want to get to something here with all the prophecies that were written about jesus christ with all the prophecies that were written about jesus christ how would it be possible young people listen closely i want your your attention how would it be possible possibly for the scriptures to be so accurate you're going to meet up with people out there in the world in school many of them being written 1500 now the difference between him and you as a son and like he was at the beginning the word body he came in and lived in that film in the person of melchizedek now you bypass that because in that form he knows all things and you have never been able to know that i'm going to say it again you have not been able to know that yet but when the message come forward what did it do it began to activate it it began to release the members of the body who they were knowing it was such a beautiful message on wednesday how many enjoyed that you have the father that sent him went with him then if he knew all things yesterday god knows all things even the way that he died even in the circumstances of his death had to be divinely ordained [Music] [Applause] it controls the body what sent the right man at the right time to help him carry the cross and what about controlling the precise moment [Applause] [Applause] broken during the crucifixion of jesus christ the normal procedure that requires breaking the lower legs the the procedure this is not some hollywood fiction story the thought of god [Music] that there was a virgin that believed a virgin that was waiting and by the transmission the message came from an angel [Applause] she accepts the word of the angel sometimes because this is this blows me away why can't we pick up anything from the fourth dimension on our own we need a television we need apparatus when you think about dimensions i mean even brother brown's talking about the angel said they came at such a velocity such a speech step into time oh church if you could just grasp that it was what he did for you and i okay at such a speed slows himself into a sound watch this now are you with me church watch this now this this gets me and as he slows himself down imagine what it's like imagine eternal being [Applause] and he says i got right in an hour give me like 10 minutes and i'll wrap it up in chapter 12. let's go up to jerusalem all the things that were written by the prophets professor in the son of man and in the old testament prophecy prophecy passover lamb jesus perfectly jesus who's got the numbers 912 numeros deuteronomy 21 22. go ahead this is talking about the passover lamb [Music] because they couldn't leave the passover lamb nope according to all the ordinances of the passover they shall keep it oh my they shall keep it deuteronomy 21. 22. and if a man have committed a sin worthy of death he took on our sin and he be and he be to be put to death and thou hang him on a tree his body shall not remain all night upon the tree stop right there that's enough right because the scripture who inspired joseph go ask for his body [Applause] david in psalms 34 20 just read it from up here if you would psalms 34 20. this is david now he keepeth all his bones not one of them is broken that is exodus 12 and numbers 9 were written 1500 years before jesus was even born and psalms 34 john 19 tells you that and i'll read it real quick 1931 the jews their pre preparation for the bodies cannot remain upon the cross on the sabbath day that their legs might be broken and that they might be taken away then came the soldiers and break the legs of the first and of the other which was crucified with him but when they came to jesus and saw he was dead already what kept them from [Music] oh but one of the soldiers here's this side what inspired him to pierce his side [Music] but that soldier was a gentile heathen and forthwith came water and blood blood and water for these things were done that the scripture should be fulfilled just read it real quick from up here zechariah 12 10. and i will pour out upon the house of david and upon the inhabitants of jerusalem the spirit of grace and their supplications and they shall look upon me whom they appear my my mind you can you can read the rest of it later are you starting to see the power of the scripture i'm finishing now are you starting to see the power of the scriptures i want you to tell your neighbor a neighbor these scriptures is powerful it's more powerful than i thought these are the scriptures written about the groom 2 000 [Applause] the scriptures cannot be broken [Applause] [Music] that he would have the confidence knowing that these prophets of old will ever with every head bowed i just want to know if there's somebody here that just the pastor i i hear i hear what the lord is saying senora would you come lord father you see every updated hand [Music] from the depths of our hearts lord that is our greatest desire to be a a word bride but not just that church lord no soul really father let us men be scriptural husbands [Music] jesus knowing that what you have spoken as your word says cast your bread up on the water it'll never come back oh lord we're thankful to you for that scriptures can't be broken thankful to you lord gracias for loving us as you have loved us the lord if we could only realize
