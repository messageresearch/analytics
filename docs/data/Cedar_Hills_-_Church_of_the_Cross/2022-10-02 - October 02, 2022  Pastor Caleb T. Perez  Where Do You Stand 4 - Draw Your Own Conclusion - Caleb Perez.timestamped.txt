[32:09] life-changing uh in in different ways
[32:15] experiences on this trip I tell you what
[32:17] I I was as I was sitting there
[32:19] meditating Santa's experience I remember
[32:22] this and I remember that and he said
[32:26] my heart was overflowing just to
[32:28] remember all that God had done on this
[32:31] trip
[32:34] this would be number four on where do
[32:37] you stand
[32:38] with a subtitle draw your own
[32:41] conclusions
[32:44] might not be what you think it is but
[32:46] wait till the end you'll get it
[32:49] but we're glad to be home would you
[32:51] stand as we read God's word
[32:55] once again we live in a day and age
[32:57] where we must always know where we stand
[33:04] we must know how we stand
[33:07] if not
[33:09] no we'll slip and slide everywhere
[33:12] now we don't know what we're supposed to
[33:15] be doing or where we're supposed to be
[33:18] but we must know what we believe and why
[33:22] we believe what we say we believe
[33:26] you'll understand in a little bit so if
[33:29] we can be so kind if you can be so kind
[33:31] to to open your Bibles to the Book of
[33:34] Psalms
[33:36] salmos
[33:38] chapter 122 and verse 1 and 2.
[33:45] I don't know about you but the scripture
[33:48] reads like this I was glad he says
[33:50] I want you to turn to your neighbor and
[33:53] say neighbor I was glad are you glad see
[33:56] were you glad to come to church this
[33:58] morning
[33:59] you ask your neighbor neighbor were you
[34:01] glad to come this morning
[34:05] if you're just here just to pass the
[34:07] time and you're not glad
[34:10] we are here because we are glad
[34:14] I want to say I was glad when they said
[34:17] unto me well they said
[34:20] let us go into the house of the Lord
[34:24] verse 2 our feet shall stand within thy
[34:29] Gates o Jerusalem
[34:33] my goodness may God add His blessings to
[34:36] the written of his word you may be
[34:38] seated
[34:39] nobody's in a hurry this morning
[34:42] all right that's we're not in a hurry
[34:44] and and we'll well there won't be no
[34:47] evening service so so we'll just we'll
[34:49] just have a good time in the Lord
[34:51] all right amen amen I want to say once
[34:55] again that these last two weeks have
[34:56] been of great importance in my life
[35:00] there are moments there are events that
[35:04] Mark Our Lives
[35:07] they mark them in such a way that they
[35:10] become reference points to you in your
[35:12] life
[35:16] and points that you can refer back to
[35:19] anytime whenever you're going through
[35:20] the ups and downs of life
[35:24] God gave us the opportunity to go to
[35:28] Israel
[35:29] Israel and he gave us the opportunity to
[35:33] stand within the Gates of Jerusalem
[35:37] that's why I read the scripture where do
[35:40] you stand this morning
[35:43] where do we stand and it says I our feet
[35:46] shall stand within thy Gates o Jerusalem
[35:52] what a thing it is it was when we were
[35:55] able to stand in the Gates of Jerusalem
[36:02] and and this message is more along the
[36:05] lines of the different experiences that
[36:07] we had during this trip yesterday
[36:11] we'll we'll do another message next week
[36:14] and we'll add some more to the trip and
[36:16] and and so forth but but just a few
[36:18] things we we want to we want to hit and
[36:21] highlights
[36:24] there was something that the Lord was
[36:27] wanting to show me on this trip
[36:30] something of great significance
[36:33] significance I wasn't looking for some
[36:36] other religion
[36:37] religion hello everybody I wasn't I
[36:40] wasn't out there looking for some other
[36:42] message
[36:43] I wasn't looking for some kind of
[36:46] Enlightenment oh seriously you know
[36:48] there's people that travel around and
[36:50] they're they're looking for in light to
[36:51] be enlightened right
[36:55] the Gospel of Jesus Christ has already
[36:58] in life
[36:59] but I was looking for something that was
[37:02] a little deeper Within Myself
[37:06] anybody ever get to that point in life
[37:09] you feel like sometimes you're a little
[37:12] bit shallow in certain areas
[37:16] we feel a little shallow in certain
[37:18] areas
[37:20] there's some areas we feel like we maybe
[37:22] are are pretty deep
[37:25] but in all reality there's so much
[37:29] shallowness in our lives
[37:31] I was looking for something deeper not
[37:35] out there within myself
[37:39] foreign
[37:48] as if I knew nothing
[37:51] I purpose to go with my heart open we
[37:54] call me my ears ready to hear my eyes
[37:57] ready to see
[38:00] and where did I find myself
[38:03] standing in the Gates of Jerusalem
[38:06] I want to start off that before I I left
[38:12] the the night before I left
[38:15] I am grateful to God for a dream that he
[38:19] gave me
[38:21] and this is what kind of when I had set
[38:24] my mind to this
[38:27] uh this dream came
[38:30] and in the dream I found myself in a
[38:33] large house
[38:35] I did not recognize the house it was a
[38:38] it was a great a big great house I don't
[38:40] know
[38:41] and I remember feeling a joy in my heart
[38:45] that I had never felt before
[38:48] it wasn't a joy that came upon me
[38:51] it was the joy that came from inside of
[38:55] me
[38:57] something that was I I guess we could
[38:59] say a joy unspeakable and full of Glory
[39:04] it was like nothing that I had ever felt
[39:08] before
[39:10] I uh as I was in that dream walking
[39:13] through this house
[39:17] there was there was it's like I was on
[39:20] another level
[39:22] there was the depth of this joy that I I
[39:25] had never I had never encountered
[39:30] and I remember and I would remember
[39:33] walking through the house
[39:35] I couldn't contain myself
[39:38] I was whoa
[39:43] and I just couldn't control myself
[39:48] and and but but amidst all this Joy I
[39:53] mean um I knew there was something that
[39:56] was that was causing this Joy
[40:00] I knew Within Myself That the
[40:03] resurrection was on
[40:06] Resurrection
[40:07] I went to the front door
[40:10] and as I opened the door
[40:13] I see a few few people standing outside
[40:18] but my my sight went right to my mother
[40:22] and father
[40:24] she was she was looking up at him
[40:27] and it was like if they had just
[40:30] reunited
[40:32] and as I was watching them
[40:36] that Joy it was like I said on another
[40:40] level
[40:41] and it was I could feel as if the Lord
[40:44] was telling me
[40:46] remember this feeling
[40:49] remember this Joy
[40:52] because the next time you feel This Joy
[40:55] again
[41:17] and says there's a few things that are
[41:19] going to try to hinder you particles
[41:23] the Lord will take care of everything
[41:26] don't let it stop you well I knew that
[41:30] dream it was a confirmation
[41:36] there are deeper things in the world
[41:39] there are deeper things in us that have
[41:42] not yet been tapped
[41:46] that say neighbor there are deeper
[41:50] things in us
[41:52] that have not been tapped into yet
[41:55] that's what I'm after this morning
[41:58] there are those things and we must and
[42:01] we need to tap into them

[47:10] I said because you know I I'm sure I

[47:24] has to do
[47:26] here I am and I'm and I'm talking to him
[47:29] and
[47:30] they began to explain it to me about the
[47:32] red heifers
[47:35] brother Abraham had just spoke about a
[47:38] few weeks
[47:41] I was like yeah I've heard that already
[47:44] and anyways as as it got on the
[47:48] conversation
[47:51] it began to uh the the gentleman he was
[47:54] doing more of the talking because the
[47:55] this the rabbi had finally fallen asleep
[48:01] and so so uh is he was expressing this
[48:04] he said you know
[48:06] the Temple Mount El Monte got into that
[48:10] part of it he says you know we could
[48:12] take the Temple Mount right now
[48:15] I mean he was adamant about are you
[48:18] aware of that is
[48:22] I remember in all this I am open to what
[48:25] the Lord is trying to tell him
[48:27] whoever
[48:29] he wants to use to talk to me I'm open
[48:32] I'm listening
[48:34] and he says
[48:38] we could take it right now
[48:41] you know why we don't
[48:43] tell me he said because we will not get
[48:47] ahead of God's program
[48:50] I said wow I like that
[48:53] you see Messiah must come first
[48:57] once we know he's here
[49:00] we'll build the temple just like that
[49:03] take it over right
[49:05] I said my goodness that's that's
[49:08] something
[49:09] he says he says but but but I want to
[49:13] tell you
[49:14] don't try to get converted into the
[49:17] judaic or judaic religion
[49:21] don't do it you're not coming to Israel
[49:24] to get converted are you
[49:26] and I said no no I don't think so
[49:32] no I think I'm okay
[49:36] and and anyways as the conversation went
[49:40] on
[49:41] he says uh uh I said you all don't
[49:45] believe don't don't the the New
[49:47] Testament to you
[49:49] no we we don't study the New Testament
[49:53] you don't really care about what Saint
[49:56] Paul had to say and this is
[49:59] just a man no no he's nothing to us
[50:03] and what about Jesus
[50:06] no he's just a man it's the man that
[50:09] everybody's trying to make God
[50:14] so you only believe your prophets
[50:18] whoever if you read this if anybody
[50:21] reads this message
[50:23] everything I'm telling him is in the
[50:26] message I'm not trying to create
[50:28] something different I'm telling him
[50:30] exactly what our Prophet brought
[50:33] and I said so so you only believe your
[50:36] prophets right
[50:38] and I said Isaiah is one of your
[50:40] prophets
[50:42] yeah he sure is and I said so answer me
[50:45] this question
[50:47] Isaiah 53.
[50:49] he was wounded for our transgress he was
[50:53] bruised foreign
[50:55] Orlando
[51:06] I wanted to get right down to it
[51:10] he just looked at me and says I don't
[51:12] know
[51:14] and I said but I do
[51:17] he said no no your Isaiah is different
[51:20] from our Isaiah
[51:23] and I said wow he said you see ours is
[51:27] written in Hebrew and the translation is
[51:30] not exactly
[51:34] I said well
[51:36] I'll tell you this is a change
[51:45] I said then you answer me this question
[51:47] is
[51:52] what relationship will he have to God
[51:56] I was asking him all the questions yes
[52:03] he says he'll be the messenger of God
[52:08] he will be God El serradios
[52:13] When I See This
[52:15] I understand as you talk with them
[52:19] struggle that that the Apostle Paul had
[52:23] to get these Jews
[52:26] to understand and see
[52:30] to see the Covenant of Grace
[52:36] don't ever become a Jew or or or come
[52:40] into Judaism
[52:41] he says there's 800 laws that we have to
[52:45] abide by every day
[52:49] wow 800. he said yeah there's 800 laws
[52:54] he said it takes years and years to to
[52:58] memorize them all
[53:01] I said well I said I'm not here for that
[53:06] he says well
[53:08] I can see that uh
[53:11] I'm not going to convince you of
[53:13] anything
[53:15] you're not going to convince me of
[53:17] anything
[53:19] so we'll just leave it like that and not
[53:21] debate about it
[53:23] he said really you asked too many
[53:26] questions
[53:29] he was so perturbed at that point
[53:32] I said sir I'm sorry I don't need to ask
[53:36] so many questions but I appreciate your
[53:38] time
[53:39] that you that you gave me in the answers
[53:41] I appreciate it
[53:43] and and as we as we as you go on and
[53:47] you're and you're talking with them
[53:50] you see that blindness not full
[53:53] blindness no nothing against complexity
[53:57] you can't just look and say oh what do
[53:59] you think about the Jews
[54:02] that's all you think about the Jews
[54:04] you're missing it by a million miles
[54:08] still the people of God
[54:10] I told them I said I believe that you
[54:13] all are the people of God
[54:15] but as you're talking to them
[54:18] they are so sure
[54:22] 3500 years later
[54:26] after Moses came they are still standing
[54:30] strong with the mosaic laws
[54:33] and not so-called Believers
[54:37] 57 years after our Prophet passes away
[54:42] we're not sure if he was even a
[54:45] propheter if we even believe the message
[54:51] 3500 years later they're still believing
[54:54] money
[54:56] why does that show us what is that
[54:58] telling us this morning
[55:00] that many times our religion is too
[55:03] shallows
[55:05] we have a shallow religion
[55:09] whenever we feel like it
[55:11] hello everybody
[55:15] let me tell you a little bit about them
[55:18] it's serious to them
[55:21] middle of the flight
[55:24] 80 of them
[55:26] it was time to pray they do not care
[55:30] who's watching them
[55:31] they don't care what anybody thinks
[55:34] about it it's time to pray
[55:37] they wrap their things around their arms
[55:40] they put this thing on their heads they
[55:44] put their caps on they have their curl
[55:47] things that go down
[55:51] the stewardess
[55:53] you you got to you gotta move out of the
[55:56] way I need to do my job
[56:05] but you get us today that supposedly the
[56:07] Bride of Jesus Christ
[56:15] to tell somebody what Jesus Christ who
[56:18] he is and what he has done
[56:20] what's wrong
[56:28] it was a wonderful trip
[56:31] and now and that was just the first day
[56:33] yes
[56:36] back of anxiety
[56:38] yeah
[56:39] I realized
[56:41] when you look at them
[56:44] how
[56:45] undisciplined we are getting falta is
[56:52] I'm going to say it again
[56:56] I don't have to look at anybody else
[57:02] and I felt embarrassed
[57:06] I don't know how else to say I felt it
[57:08] is
[57:10] I said Lord they have only the Old
[57:12] Testament
[57:16] they stand for their people they're not
[57:19] over there about their the other sister
[57:22] the brother that they disagree with
[57:24] him
[57:27] you're in the airport they go down the
[57:30] line are you an Israeli citizens
[57:34] go down your Israelis come with me thank
[57:37] God
[57:39] they take care of their own
[57:43] I'm not
[57:45] what lessons I learned
[57:48] they don't sit there and talk did you
[57:51] know according to to to to the Hebrew
[57:53] Bible that
[57:58] the sin of Gossip El pecado Del chisme
[58:01] is equal to is out of murder is
[58:08] go back and look at it it's the same to
[58:10] them
[58:10] and the person that laughs at the one
[58:13] saying it is
[58:16] guilty as the one saying it is me
[58:23] and us in the same church
[58:26] that's the greatest message
[58:29] can't stand one another
[58:34] I think we got a lot of growing
[58:40] they
[58:42] when Shabbat comes
[58:44] that's the Sabbath this is
[58:52] everything stops
[58:56] it's their rest that they're looking for
[58:59] all because
[59:02] now we understand the the real rest what
[59:05] it is today
[59:07] take away how disciplined they are
[59:10] notice I I wasn't going to try to say oh
[59:13] this is where they're wrong I wasn't
[59:15] going on the trip for that
[59:18] they do not do nothing
[59:21] not even go up an elevator
[59:24] work to press the button
[59:30] about their God
[59:34] you know we were talking me and sister
[59:36] Marie yesterday sister Marie and we're

[1:00:32] and all Saturday evening you were
[1:00:34] already in Sunday

[1:00:40] God worship and doing all that that you

[1:00:45] where are those days anymore
[1:00:50] we're out on Saturday night
[1:00:53] movies
[1:00:56] instead of preparing ourselves

[1:01:02] morning were the first days

[1:01:33] embarrassed
[1:01:35] as a pastor Como Pastor I am embarrassed
[1:01:43] then we try to tell someone
[1:01:45] how we should be hello
[1:01:48] and
[1:01:50] we're labeled legalists is
[1:01:56] thank you
[1:01:59] we're extremists
[1:02:01] we're not under the law
[1:02:04] let me tell you Grace is much more
[1:02:08] disciplined than them
[1:02:11] but because we have made Grace a
[1:02:14] disgrace
[1:02:20] what a message last Sunday
[1:02:23] not give God his worship
[1:02:26] yo
[1:02:44] Mama we have a shallow relationship
[1:02:49] I bought a book in Israel called
[1:02:51] listening to the language of the Bible
[1:02:57] Understanding the Hebrew language
[1:03:03] I read it and I said
[1:03:05] wow I'm done with it
[1:03:09] I said wow
[1:03:12] our modern Western culture
[1:03:19] we're always trying to and brother Brown
[1:03:21] tells us
[1:03:23] we're trying to understand an Eastern
[1:03:26] book
[1:03:29] with a western mentality Occidental and
[1:03:32] we think we're hot stuff
[1:03:34] I think that we got it down I'm talking
[1:03:36] about myself
[1:03:38] you know what that means
[1:03:40] let me explain these things to you
[1:03:43] when we as a western culture
[1:03:48] we always tend to focus on the mental
[1:03:51] activity everything
[1:03:54] is a mental activity
[1:03:57] now now now listen closely to this
[1:04:02] we always stress the intellectual part
[1:04:06] of everything
[1:04:10] we stress the intellectual part of
[1:04:13] hearing
[1:04:16] but we minimize the part of doing
[1:04:22] Jesus said there to be not be not just
[1:04:25] hearers of the word of the word
[1:04:29] and when we speak
[1:04:31] in our language in the Eastern in the
[1:04:33] English tongue is
[1:04:35] we use the verb to know
[1:04:40] and we think of it as our mental grasp
[1:04:44] of facts
[1:04:47] now listen closely okay you got to get
[1:04:49] these things right here
[1:04:51] we got to know this watch this now we
[1:04:55] once again
[1:04:56] we think that the more facts we know
[1:04:59] about something
[1:05:02] the more we know about the subject
[1:05:05] yes or yes
[1:05:07] I heard that already
[1:05:11] what are you doing about it
[1:05:16] once again
[1:05:18] we think the more facts we know
[1:05:22] the more we know about the subject
[1:05:25] but in the Hebrew word
[1:05:28] the word
[1:05:30] is yada which means to know
[1:05:34] but rather than just knowing information
[1:05:39] the Hebrew idea of yada is
[1:05:45] it stresses knowing from experience
[1:05:51] and relationships
[1:05:56] on that knowledge
[1:05:59] in other words they take it and they see
[1:06:02] it one word
[1:06:04] as the whole process
[1:06:07] we look at one word to no means that
[1:06:10] I've I I have heard I've listened and I
[1:06:14] have accumulated facts about that
[1:06:17] subject
[1:06:19] to know to them
[1:06:22] is their experience their relationship
[1:06:25] with God
[1:06:27] that's why it's so important to them
[1:06:31] that's why they are so disciplined
[1:06:34] now listen to this this is where we
[1:06:38] learn about the Bible concept of the
[1:06:41] knowledge of God
[1:06:44] we as westerners we
[1:06:49] think that this means to prove God's
[1:06:54] existence and establish is
[1:06:59] theological model of how to explain God
[1:07:02] um
[1:07:05] but to the Hebrews
[1:07:08] their knowledge or view of the knowledge
[1:07:11] of God
[1:07:12] is having a life in relationship with
[1:07:17] him
[1:07:19] so to the Hebrews knowledge is not just
[1:07:23] knowing who someone is
[1:07:26] it is your Devotion to them
[1:07:31] my goodness
[1:07:33] I am
[1:07:39] the Jews seen the knowledge of God
[1:07:43] has intimacy with God
[1:07:46] not let me explain to you
[1:07:50] so many times they would say that
[1:07:54] I can't get you to see that I won't even
[1:07:56] tell you not the way
[1:07:59] you're not going to understand
[1:08:01] this is we think differently than you
[1:08:04] are
[1:08:05] we see the whole process that's why
[1:08:08] Johnny when he's writing in the
[1:08:11] beginning was the word
[1:08:14] the word was with God the Word was God
[1:08:17] the word was made flesh the whole
[1:08:20] genealogy of the world
[1:08:22] Larry word logos is the whole process
[1:08:27] the mind of God all the way down
[1:08:30] he became flesh and then he ascended
[1:08:33] back on time
[1:08:35] it's the whole processo
[1:08:40] do we know a lot
[1:08:42] of facts about God
[1:08:45] or do we really know him personally
[1:08:49] what's your knowledge of God
[1:08:53] do we know him by Nature
[1:08:56] by his character or character by his
[1:08:59] mind or simply because somebody told us
[1:09:02] about him
[1:09:05] why am I
[1:09:07] oh
[1:09:09] are you still with me
[1:09:12] on you how deep or how shallow is our
[1:09:16] relationship with God
[1:09:20] Ephesians 4 tells us
[1:09:23] he gave some Apostles and so forth
[1:09:27] but when you get down to the 13th verse
[1:09:31] till we all come in the unity of the
[1:09:34] faith
[1:09:35] this is where we should be standing
[1:09:40] till we come into the unity of the faith
[1:09:43] and of the knowledge of the Son of God
[1:09:50] but relationships
[1:09:53] hello everybody hola todos unto a
[1:09:57] perfect man unto the measure of the
[1:09:58] stature of the fullness of Christ
[1:10:02] here's the knowledge of the Son of God
[1:10:07] says Jesus on the authority of the word
[1:10:10] Jesus
[1:10:11] Christianity
[1:10:13] and the way they have it today is so
[1:10:16] shallowed
[1:10:20] no wonder the unbeliever can hardly see
[1:10:23] how to believe Christianity
[1:10:31] but Christianity is real in its power
[1:10:34] Christianity it's not just another
[1:10:37] ceremony
[1:10:38] but Christianity or church this is what
[1:10:42] should excite us this morning
[1:10:44] but Christianity
[1:10:47] is a living being
[1:10:51] in mankind
[1:10:54] that's the proof of the Resurrection
[1:11:00] who was God With Us
[1:11:03] watch watch how the Lord began to show
[1:11:06] these things on this trip
[1:11:09] I have to try to to take on some other
[1:11:12] religion and their forms and their
[1:11:13] Traditions
[1:11:16] I will try to be like some other people
[1:11:20] it's to recognize now
[1:11:23] that we're not as deep in our
[1:11:25] relationship as we think
[1:11:29] he goes on he says I tell you friends
[1:11:33] there's been many a man
[1:11:36] and is tonight
[1:11:38] that's coming down to the end of the
[1:11:41] road
[1:11:42] and they'll find out
[1:11:44] that that little shallow religion that
[1:11:48] you're holding on
[1:11:50] it won't work
[1:11:54] come on now how many are holding on to a
[1:11:56] little shallow religion
[1:11:59] go to church
[1:12:04] not that you do that
[1:12:07] what's your relationship during the week
[1:12:10] he says nothing short of being born
[1:12:13] again will work
[1:12:16] he said you see it's not a shallow
[1:12:19] Affair
[1:12:22] superficial something deep
[1:12:26] we're not babies anymore
[1:12:29] we're men and women
[1:12:31] church should be in that condition
[1:12:33] tonight
[1:12:40] oh
[1:12:42] I want you to ask yourself that question
[1:12:45] a shallow or am I deep be honest with
[1:12:48] yourself
[1:12:51] most all of Christianity
[1:12:54] in the way we see it today brother Ram
[1:12:56] says
[1:13:06] I have no idea what bubble dancing
[1:13:10] but it's like bubble dancing
[1:13:13] we find out what bubble dancing is you
[1:13:15] let me know
[1:13:17] bubble dances
[1:13:19] bubble dance
[1:13:22] want to see if you don't then you could
[1:13:23] tell us what it is
[1:13:30] I've said this before there's a there
[1:13:32] was a study made at MIT
[1:13:34] um
[1:13:36] as to whether or not a person can
[1:13:38] multitask yes
[1:13:41] the results were that
[1:13:44] it's impossible
[1:13:47] for a person to multitask in-depth mode
[1:13:52] at the moment you begin to do more than
[1:13:55] one thing
[1:13:58] your brain goes into shallow mode
[1:14:02] not be in depth mode
[1:14:06] dealing with two or more things
[1:14:09] no wonder the scripture says you cannot
[1:14:13] serve God and Mammon
[1:14:18] foreign
[1:14:52] buyers stand in nosotos where I can get
[1:14:56] this across I was
[1:14:59] standing somewhere
[1:15:02] it makes a great state
[1:15:06] and that statement is that I left the
[1:15:09] path is
[1:15:11] [Music]
[1:15:15] I'm upstairs
[1:15:19] I left the path
[1:15:21] they came down from the top you have to
[1:15:24] pass down the aisle
[1:15:25] of how to get it
[1:15:32] a path was left to get there
[1:15:36] I don't know how many you remember years
[1:15:38] some years ago brother Ben preached a
[1:15:40] tremendous message on that
[1:15:43] every place that you you put your soul I
[1:15:48] have given unto you Jose Jose
[1:15:52] amen and always remember that wherever
[1:15:54] we go we live an imprint
[1:16:00] man I'm gonna say it again
[1:16:02] we leave an imprint for someone
[1:16:08] you walk into a bar you stand
[1:16:11] you're leaving the soul the imprint of
[1:16:14] your soul of your foot there
[1:16:17] somebody will fall
[1:16:22] go to the movies every week
[1:16:25] worn out path to the movies

[1:16:51] I understand
[1:16:52] whether it's wet or dry and you're

[1:16:56] then you try to get off of the rut
[1:16:59] get off get out and then on the wrong
[1:17:02] and then you'll get back into this yeah
[1:17:04] but he made the run that was came before
[1:17:07] you yes and you're trapped in that run
[1:17:11] that's a lot of Christians

[1:17:21] everywhere the soles of your feet
[1:17:27] I'm sure we're not proud of everywhere
[1:17:31] we have yeah
[1:17:34] have you ever thought that
[1:17:37] all the worn paths that we have made
[1:17:41] that our children will follow

[1:27:02] footsteps Las Vegas
[1:27:06] I said I believed we're at the end she
[1:27:09] said but everything that's happening has
[1:27:10] happened before it's it's history
[1:27:12] repeats
[1:27:14] I said yeah it repeats itself
[1:27:17] I said but there's a difference now
[1:27:20] that right before his coming
[1:27:23] promised to send it
[1:27:28] prophet

[1:28:44] El Camino
[1:28:46] you talk about going back and forth in
[1:28:48] him
[1:28:52] I I I saw him and I and I my heart
[1:28:55] yearned for his soul
[1:29:01] didn't know anything else doesn't know
[1:29:04] anything else about it that's all he
[1:29:05] knows
[1:29:06] comes from generation upon generation of
[1:29:09] Catholics
[1:29:12] he says
[1:29:13] I believe that God is love
[1:29:17] and that he will not send anyone to hell
[1:29:22] he knows we all make mistakes
[1:29:25] I said I believe he made a way
[1:29:28] love provided a savior
[1:29:31] he says but but he will not send anyone
[1:29:33] to him
[1:29:35] he knows we're just human yes
[1:29:51] he says
[1:29:52] well you think people are going to go to
[1:29:55] hell
[1:30:00] just like you right now you're given the
[1:30:02] opportunity
[1:30:06] I don't know I said do you read the
[1:30:08] Bible
[1:30:09] well yeah but I don't know I said the
[1:30:11] Bible says enter ye in at the Straight
[1:30:13] Gate
[1:30:15] for why does the Gayden brought us the
[1:30:17] way that leadeth to destruction
[1:30:20] many there be that will find it
[1:30:23] will go there at I said but straight is
[1:30:27] the gate and narrow is the way that
[1:30:29] leads to life
[1:30:31] and few there be that we'll find it gave
[1:30:35] him the Plan of Redemption by the time
[1:30:38] we got there his eyes were watery I
[1:30:41] don't know mad because
[1:30:45] but he was just like I never heard these
[1:30:48] things and I said but you have now
[1:30:51] here's my foreign
[1:31:06] and I see how
[1:31:08] there are so many footprints that have
[1:31:11] been made through time
[1:31:14] he allowed me to speak to a devout Jew a
[1:31:17] rabbi
[1:31:20] two Catholics
[1:31:23] what was I doing
[1:31:25] showing them yes
[1:31:29] young people you all have no excuse
[1:31:32] you've been shown the footprints
[1:31:35] for by his own blood Jesus entered once
[1:31:39] into the holy of into the holy place
[1:31:45] what does the enemy try to do
[1:31:49] he tries to cover up the tracks
[1:31:52] it tries to cover up the footprints
[1:31:55] we have seen that time and time again
[1:32:00] that's why every generation foreign
[1:32:11] because the winds and the storms have
[1:32:14] covered up many foots
[1:32:17] but when you go and you put your foot
[1:32:20] again
[1:32:23] freshens up the footprint
[1:32:26] or someone that's coming
[1:32:29] what we didn't know brother Tommy
[1:32:34] no but the footprint has made been made
[1:32:36] fresh again
[1:32:38] there are people that continue to walk
[1:32:41] continue to put their Footprints
[1:32:44] same place
[1:32:55] they are fresh this morning
[1:32:58] again
[1:33:00] put your foot down
[1:33:03] show where you're standing
[1:33:06] one of my desires
[1:33:10] was to go to the Eastern Gate
[1:33:16] the Bible says that when Jesus came into
[1:33:18] Jerusalem this is Matthew 21 10.
[1:33:21] he come into Jerusalem yes he said the
[1:33:24] only way he could come into Jerusalem
[1:33:27] to have left his Footprints away Mount
[1:33:31] of Olives
[1:33:32] all the way to Jerusalem he left his
[1:33:35] Footprints and all the city was moved
[1:33:40] think of it come on put on your
[1:33:42] spiritual Cap all the sitting was moved
[1:33:44] they thought they knew where they were
[1:33:46] standing
[1:33:48] when he enters in the gates
[1:33:54] where you think you're standing
[1:34:02] Jesus walks into this
[1:34:05] notice this now
[1:34:07] he was coming into Jerusalem through the
[1:34:09] Eastern Gate
[1:34:11] Ezekiel 44 1-2 if you would por favor
[1:34:16] and it says
[1:34:18] then he brought me back the way of the
[1:34:21] gate
[1:34:23] of the outward Sanctuary
[1:34:28] took it toward the East
[1:34:31] and it was
[1:34:34] then said the Lord unto me
[1:34:37] this gate shall be shut
[1:34:40] up
[1:34:42] it shall not be opened
[1:34:44] and no man shall enter in by it
[1:34:48] because the Lord the god of Israel
[1:34:51] Israel have entered in by it
[1:34:55] therefore it shall be shut
[1:34:59] oh my goodness
[1:35:01] wait till them rabbis
[1:35:03] realize who it was
[1:35:06] he's just a man and they try to make him
[1:35:09] God
[1:35:10] your Prophet Ezekiel said
[1:35:14] the Lord the god of Israel has entered
[1:35:18] when did he enter in when Messiah came
[1:35:21] walking
[1:35:23] oh Church come on come with me this
[1:35:27] morning and while all the other Gates
[1:35:30] had hats there were so many people
[1:35:33] around it
[1:35:35] I was telling my uncle Abraham
[1:35:37] you talk about scripture when you see it
[1:35:40] being that it has been fulfilled
[1:35:44] that the city of of of of Jerusalem the
[1:35:48] old city
[1:35:49] has been cut into four parts
[1:35:54] the Gentiles have overrun it Los
[1:35:56] gentiles
[1:35:58] one part
[1:36:01] the second part the Armenians those
[1:36:05] Armenians the third part
[1:36:07] fourth part it's the Jewish quarter
[1:36:11] there's four parts
[1:36:14] tremendous when you see this you can
[1:36:17] feel the difference of the spirit
[1:36:18] whenever you go in
[1:36:21] this is where the Muslim quarter starts
[1:36:26] here's where the Christians amazing
[1:36:32] the Bible says here that it after the
[1:36:34] Lord God he hath entered in by it
[1:36:40] see all the other Gates
[1:36:43] but the Eastern Gate is
[1:36:48] put on a picture of that
[1:36:51] um
[1:36:54] you see it okay
[1:36:59] I walked out of the Lion's gate
[1:37:04] the first thing I see is
[1:37:07] I remember I preached this message
[1:37:10] how that
[1:37:12] the Muslims they have put a cemetery
[1:37:15] right in front of the East again
[1:37:22] of this of these of these tombs
[1:37:28] who did that
[1:37:30] Solomon remember the ottoman yeah
[1:37:38] he says let's keep Messiah out
[1:37:43] so so they put the the the cemetery in
[1:37:48] front
[1:37:48] why because the priest cannot go in
[1:37:51] through
[1:37:55] wow the law says
[1:37:57] a priest cannot go in through it through
[1:37:59] a cemetery
[1:38:02] the Forerunner can't go through a
[1:38:04] cemetery
[1:38:05] he can't go to the cemetery
[1:38:09] and then no Forerunner comes
[1:38:12] then Messiah can't come
[1:38:15] and then we have nothing to fear
[1:38:20] the cemetery
[1:38:24] and this is right
[1:38:27] that's
[1:38:28] 16 feet of concrete
[1:38:39] and to be able to see it is just it did
[1:38:42] something for me
[1:38:44] there was nobody there but us
[1:38:48] and we began to sing
[1:38:52] I will meet you in the morning
[1:38:57] just inside the Eastern Gate
[1:39:02] so be ready faithful pilgrim
[1:39:06] or you'll not have long to wait
[1:39:10] oh you could feel the presence of the
[1:39:11] Lord start to move and then all of a
[1:39:14] sudden Brother Carlos puts on a tape
[1:39:18] and he said hope you say by God's grace
[1:39:23] no no no hope his wife hope
[1:39:27] by God's grace
[1:39:29] on that morning you stand right over
[1:39:33] there by the side of that Eastern Gate
[1:39:37] and when you see Abraham and Isaac and
[1:39:40] Jacob economies
[1:39:43] you'll go to screaming bills
[1:39:47] just as loud as you can
[1:39:50] we'll have the children
[1:39:53] I'll meet you there
[1:39:55] she said I'll be waiting for you
[1:39:58] to hear the sound the voice of the
[1:40:01] Prophet right
[1:40:03] outside of the city of Jerusalem
[1:40:06] and then we put another one on he says
[1:40:11] Judah guards the Eastern Gate
[1:40:14] and Christ is the lion of the tribe of
[1:40:17] Judah
[1:40:31] until Messiah comes
[1:40:35] something was drawn
[1:40:37] stand within the Gates of Jerusalem
[1:40:41] Church the path has been carved out
[1:40:44] the imprint has been made
[1:40:49] let's keep making these Footprints fresh
[1:40:54] yes the way seems long
[1:40:57] we're the opposition strong you can turn
[1:41:00] the lights on
[1:41:01] but there's a way that has been provided
[1:41:06] believe me church tell me listen closely
[1:41:09] I know it's been long and hard
[1:41:13] but the pain will pass
[1:41:16] the sweat will drive
[1:41:18] the tiredness will end
[1:41:21] but there's something that will never
[1:41:23] disappear
[1:41:25] that is the satisfaction
[1:41:27] of knowing that we kept The Voice
[1:41:35] foreign
[1:42:05] to come to a conclusion
[1:42:08] simply means that you've come to the end
[1:42:11] or the Finish
[1:42:13] of an event or
[1:42:16] processo how many have come to a
[1:42:18] conclusion
[1:42:21] how many have concluded that what we
[1:42:23] follow
[1:42:24] is nothing but the truth is
[1:42:29] I spoke to them Church Hermanos
[1:42:33] I've seen the footprints they followed
[1:42:37] there ain't nothing like the footprints
[1:42:39] that have been left by Yeshua
[1:42:41] I'm going to say it again there's
[1:42:43] nothing that has been left like the
[1:42:45] bloody Footprints of Jehovah Las Vegas
[1:42:52] each one of them that I spoke to have
[1:42:54] had come to a conclusion in their life
[1:42:57] but I pray once again that a seed was
[1:43:00] planted
[1:43:04] brother Branham says message blind
[1:43:06] Bartimaeus I'm in a corner now
[1:43:09] but what are you doing well my pastor
[1:43:13] says it's not true
[1:43:15] hypnotism
[1:43:19] you're a fanatic the pastor says that
[1:43:21] it's of the devil
[1:43:24] but what are you doing
[1:43:29] you're basing your conclusion on their
[1:43:33] decisions
[1:43:35] closely this is important now this is
[1:43:38] the this is we're coming to the end of
[1:43:39] the message
[1:43:41] why are we shallow
[1:43:44] because we've based our conclusions
[1:43:48] on someone else's decision and that is
[1:43:53] well my mom and dad say that's where the
[1:43:55] truth so I get you're basing it on their
[1:43:57] decisions
[1:43:59] you got to make a decision on your own I
[1:44:02] will get scared of the Lord
[1:44:05] he's given me all that I need
[1:44:08] to base it upon the not even the
[1:44:11] pastor's decision
[1:44:12] you've got to have your own decisions
[1:44:15] make your own decisions
[1:44:21] watch how brother Branham hits this
[1:44:24] please
[1:44:25] based it on someone else's decision
[1:44:29] there's no conclusion without first
[1:44:31] making a decision
[1:44:34] but when you fly loose and you jump to
[1:44:37] every conclusion
[1:44:40] you haven't got Bible Temperance yet
[1:44:45] but God's program the program was for
[1:44:48] the Holy Ghost to run the church
[1:44:51] the Holy Ghost was given for the church
[1:44:55] impersonation of Christianity
[1:44:58] and we can't have two faculties running
[1:45:01] the church at the same time
[1:45:04] if man runs the church the holy ghost is
[1:45:07] out
[1:45:09] when Holy Ghost runs it then usually man
[1:45:12] goes out
[1:45:14] one or the others
[1:45:17] to this conclusion
[1:45:20] that God intends the Holy Spirit to run
[1:45:23] the church
[1:45:27] oh now I don't mean just the spirit gets
[1:45:31] up and preaches
[1:45:33] because the holy spirit sets the people
[1:45:36] in the church
[1:45:39] or a certain things and then the
[1:45:43] footprints become visible
[1:45:45] right
[1:45:56] I can't see I don't know where to walk
[1:45:58] because you haven't made your decisions
[1:46:01] you're a little too shallow still is I'm
[1:46:04] getting to something now I'm finishing
[1:46:05] up and if we will just draw from this
[1:46:09] conclusion
[1:46:11] says this is the conclusion
[1:46:14] and if we will just draw
[1:46:18] from this conclusion
[1:46:21] this morning we don't just come up with
[1:46:24] our own conclusions
[1:46:26] not just like that because then it's
[1:46:29] just based on our opinion
[1:46:32] but we must draw from this conclusion
[1:46:35] after we have made our decisions
[1:46:39] goes on to say that this day this word
[1:46:42] has been fulfilled in your ears
[1:46:45] now we want to draw from that
[1:46:50] when the word has been fulfilled in your
[1:46:53] ears
[1:46:57] a conclusion
[1:46:59] of how Dynamic is the word of God
[1:47:04] we all can figure out the mechanics
[1:47:07] but it takes the Dynamics to make it
[1:47:09] works
[1:47:13] let me hear one depth in their life
[1:47:16] get into the spirit
[1:47:19] get into Christ
[1:47:22] hello everybody
[1:47:24] he said now there's a third pool coming
[1:47:28] just a sign of the answer
[1:47:31] there's a third pool coming
[1:47:34] but don't try to explain it
[1:47:39] you see how I approach this tonight
[1:47:43] he approached it and he left Footprints
[1:47:47] see how I approached it
[1:47:50] I don't know no saying but I feel Duty
[1:47:53] bound to my church
[1:47:55] to say something
[1:47:58] you draw your own conclusions
[1:48:04] will this be the mystery that would open
[1:48:07] up
[1:48:08] that would bring Christ
[1:48:10] bring a power to the church
[1:48:13] we believe in Repentance we believe in
[1:48:16] baptizing in the name of Jesus Christ we
[1:48:19] believe in receiving the Holy Ghost
[1:48:21] signs and wonders
[1:48:23] Miracles speaking in tongues
[1:48:28] but the war has been done right here
[1:48:33] is written in the book of Acts
[1:48:37] one little group of people
[1:48:39] and this little bitty Ministry of ours
[1:48:44] what about the world over
[1:48:47] more than his Road in the book of Acts
[1:48:52] there was only three people raised
[1:48:54] raised of the Dead by Jesus Christ
[1:48:58] we have on record Jesus doctors record
[1:49:01] five
[1:49:04] this is the third pool
[1:49:06] there is a great ministry lying ahead
[1:49:12] saying draw your own conclusion
[1:49:15] the question is where are you drawing it
[1:49:19] from me
[1:49:21] well I read and I I'm drawing
[1:49:24] let's go a little further
[1:49:27] it's your obligation to get the word
[1:49:29] inside

[1:50:17] for us to make the right decisions
[1:50:20] in order to come up with the right
[1:50:22] conclusions
[1:50:23] the seals were then opened up
[1:50:27] and there it showed us who we are in the
[1:50:31] word
[1:50:33] draw or finish your own end yeah
[1:50:39] that takes depth foreign
[1:50:56] that was before thee is the gift of God
[1:51:01] and who it is that says to thee give me
[1:51:04] to drink
[1:51:08] and he would have given the Living Water
[1:51:12] the woman saith unto him
[1:51:16] thou has nothing
[1:51:18] to draw Carla
[1:51:22] and this well yes the Apostle not just

[1:51:35] no one has ever been able to get down
[1:51:38] into the depths of this world

[1:51:53] for messiah
