[30:42] we do want to express our condolences
[30:45] there to to to brother king john's
[30:48] family
[30:57] as we as our pastor asked him
[31:01] to to the tabernacle here
[31:18] and you know when you see a king kneel
[31:21] down
[31:24] he's not kneeling down to a person
[31:30] he's kneeling down to to what we
[31:33] represent
[31:38] but to see the representation of of him
[31:41] do that
[31:42] representation haciendo
[31:47] i thought a lot of humility to the
[31:50] forefront
[31:54] and i and i always always was in awe of
[31:57] that
[31:58] s
[32:02] and king john left such a lasting
[32:05] impression on me
[32:13] as i was we were at his home church
[32:20] and uh there he said i've i've had
[32:23] people to teach me
[32:40] you see those things
[32:44] i remember him addressing his ministers
[32:49] and he would say these people have money
[33:08] and i asked him he asked them he says
[33:13] do you want a bicycle or a car
[33:17] you don't go nowhere he said these
[33:21] people
[33:21] need an
[33:38] when the the pastor approached him and
[33:41] talked to him about the message
[33:47] and we we saw his receptive spirit
[33:58] that the last one to come in might just
[34:00] be a black sheep
[34:04] without
[34:14] you don't find many people
[34:25] if it wasn't for this covet we sure
[34:27] would be there as quickly as possible
[34:29] you know foreign
[34:34] showed us so much kindness
[34:38] and so much i remember sister sarah his
[34:41] wife
[34:44] and i'll finish with this one
[35:11] [Music]
[35:28] today
[35:32] is a day of of sadness in one way
[35:39] but today is uh is a is a day of
[35:42] jubilation
[35:46] because one of ours have made it
[35:51] the one the one that said the last one
[35:53] to be
[35:55] come in might just be a black sheep
[36:01] and the black sheep of the colors are
[36:04] going to meet
[36:06] in a few days
[36:11] there is a time when i would like to to
[36:14] entitle my message tonight
[36:18] and as well as brother caleb says i'd
[36:20] like to to dedicate this to brother john
[36:36] now you're going to find out
[36:39] in a second
[36:42] that it's not a month can no sun mess it
[36:45] is not the presence of august
[36:49] it's the presence of nobility
[36:53] brother branham speaks to us 26 times
[36:56] about his august
[36:57] presence
[37:02] when you talk about the presence of
[37:04] almighty god his glory
[37:09] gloria his impressiveness
[37:13] his magnitude to magnitude his power
[37:16] to prevent his glory to glorious his
[37:18] majesty
[37:20] you are talking about his august
[37:22] presence
[37:27] this is what he has given us
[37:31] jesus said unto him
[37:34] blessed
[37:50] [Music]
[38:11] and the gates of hell cannot shall not
[38:14] prevail
[38:15] against it as
[38:32] whatsoever
[38:35] shall bind on earth shall be bound in
[38:39] heaven
[38:41] whatsoever thou shalt loose on earth
[38:58] but i'm going
[39:12] who he
[39:51] about 350 years ago
[39:56] a shipload of travelers landed on the
[39:58] northeast coast of america
[40:07] northeast coast of america north west
[40:11] the first year they established a town
[40:13] site
[40:17] the next year anya they elected a town
[40:21] government
[40:22] here
[40:32] plan to build a road five miles
[40:35] westward into the wilderness
[41:03] westward into a wilderness
[41:32] but in a few
[41:53] [Music]
[42:26] he continues with the contents of the
[42:28] vision
[42:40] well that was the seven sealed book sf
[42:45] now we never had books like this till
[42:48] lately
[42:52] the books in the old time were scrolls
[42:54] lost
[42:56] they if you wanted to read the book of
[43:01] isaiah
[43:03] you were turned down here to isaiah
[43:08] then unroll it
[43:26] we find that the lamb comes out
[43:31] now now we we we as as ourselves as
[43:34] believers
[43:37] we understand the sin
[45:17] kansas city is going to win anyways
[45:18] kansas city and tomorrow don't worry
[45:19] about it
[45:28] when we come to i'm kidding i don't know
[45:30] i'm a dallas
[45:43] this is the first thing that god tells
[45:46] his people
[45:50] israel israel the lord our god is
[45:53] one lord and then this is where he tells
[45:57] us
[46:00] thou shalt love the lord thy god with
[46:02] all thine heart
[46:05] don't lose this now no with all thy soul
[46:10] and with all thy might he controls you
[46:12] and these
[46:54] and
[47:08] shall have
[48:32] the greatest pastor that we've ever seen
[48:36] today god has still had given us a
[48:40] pastor the greatest one we've ever seen
[48:45] it is the august presence
[48:49] but it takes the people to believe
[48:54] to understand that when you speak about
[48:58] the things of god
[49:11] he does not share his glory with nobody
[49:28] is
[49:30] beware beware unless you forget
[49:37] where do you see people
[49:40] like we have reached
[49:57] but nobility can also
[50:00] reach down to where there's nothing
[50:06] and pick him up for that person to be a
[50:09] son or daughter of god
[50:24] they saw
[50:38] now there's no more mercy yeah i know i
[50:40] missed
[50:41] without understanding that the august
[50:45] presence is also a
[50:48] lineage that means only nothing
[50:52] without understanding that he got up out
[50:56] of that throne
[50:59] and he sat down in another throne
[51:02] now you might not have no no grace on
[51:05] that side this is
[51:20] you may be
[51:23] [Applause]
[52:01] what is he talking about question the
[52:04] august
[52:05] presence of god the presidency
[52:08] that not only fills the heaven
[52:12] but also feels the earth
[52:15] brother branham emmanuel branham when he
[52:18] conducted
[52:19] his august president superstition comes
[52:22] in and blesses us
[52:25] and proves by the scripture it is
[52:46] and i i i i hear brother branham every
[52:48] morning
[52:50] and when he's in the prayer line i don't
[52:52] know how many people do this
[52:57] i'm not saying everybody has to be what
[52:58] i do
[53:20] [Applause]
[53:27] eight or ten people right here
[53:31] sitting right here where are they
[53:37] where are you eight or ten people one
[53:40] two three
[53:53] that is bringing his presence on the
[53:55] scene
[53:57] but he'll only come solomon
[54:00] if there's lineage
[54:04] you say you have to be a perez no
[54:07] no be a christian
[54:14] [Applause]
[54:36] i'm not
[54:50] is
[55:05] to the image of his son

[55:16] your just you can shout as much as you
[55:18] can
[55:34] [Applause]
[55:51] [Applause]
[56:04] [Applause]
[56:33] [Music]
[56:56] and what
[57:24] it is a done deal
[57:35] nothing could conquer christ
[57:49] i believe that our pastor this morning
[57:51] when he said that excitement he didn't
[57:53] mean not not to say amen
[58:01] what he meant i believe look piece of
[58:04] the scene
[58:05] was that he you don't get frustrated
[58:10] things don't just you don't you don't
[58:12] fly off the handle
[58:15] because of what things go around
[58:18] but nothing could conquer
[58:24] [Applause]
[58:33] nothing could conquer christ
[59:12] is that true brother brown says
[59:30] is
[59:37] all things are possible with god nothing
[59:40] impossible

[1:07:26] minister
[1:07:28] minister and i was talking to them

[1:07:40] brother
[1:07:52] the day before they wanted to throw us

[1:08:04] but then the queen shows up now the
[1:08:08] manager doesn't know what to do with us
[1:08:12] i'm so sorry he said this
[1:08:15] didn't know what kind of people you were
[1:08:20] anybody can shout but
[1:09:04] somebody
[1:09:17] he's giving me the power he's giving me
[1:09:21] access to him
[1:09:23] whatever look at him whatever
[1:09:29] now me me and brother patrick you you
[1:09:31] know yo yo mano
[1:09:39] brother patrick's brother patrick saying
[1:09:41] is this
[1:09:44] whatever okay whatever

[1:10:11] and you just look at them and say let me
[1:10:12] just say this
[1:10:14] whatever look at that
[1:10:18] whatever look is there and this is what
[1:10:20] jesus does
[1:10:21] is jesus he only injects the
[1:10:24] emphatic variant
[1:10:41] he gives it to the people
[1:10:57] at us can you imagine if you're down
[1:11:00] right here
[1:11:03] and you see a brother a brother sick
[1:11:09] a brother that that that that needs
[1:11:11] deliverance

[1:14:34] what kind of atom
[1:14:37] did he turn loose
[1:14:40] to make the regular wheat but i said
[1:14:43] regular it was the same one he turned
[1:14:49] loose when he turned the water into wine
[1:14:55] now you you got to understand and i got
[1:14:57] i got to finish
[1:15:00] you got to understand this that here the
[1:15:03] lord jesus is here

[1:15:10] the little boy
[1:15:11] with with with five loaves and two
[1:15:14] fishes
[1:15:18] and in his hands in the little boy's
[1:15:20] hands
[1:15:23] is just enough to make a couple of
[1:15:25] sandwiches
