[8:00] this on oh do lodo do lord or do
[8:05] remember me
[8:07] [Music]
[8:13] - Lord
[8:23] [Music]
[8:30] hello everybody how are you I'm sorry if
[8:35] I may make some faces or may not talk
[8:38] well because I just got braces and it's
[8:40] uncomfortable anyway god bless you all
[8:43] and I hope you guys are having a
[8:44] wonderful day
[8:45] and I'd like to thank my pastor for
[8:47] letting me be here today and to talk to
[8:50] you a little bit how how God does
[8:52] miracles and how God how God's promises
[8:56] and how and God's faith so if you don't
[9:07] mind please can you turn to your Bibles
[9:10] into second Corinthians 5:7 and it says
[9:21] for we walk by faith and not by sight so
[9:25] is it okay if I give you an example what
[9:28] that means okay so so whenever what that
[9:36] means is oh you may be seated
[9:42] sorry so what that means is like the
[9:49] smallest things in life that like let's
[9:51] say for an example whenever you're about
[9:53] to eat how many likes you I know saying
[9:57] I like lasagna and so uh so some people
[10:04] who like to pray for their food same I
[10:09] do too
[10:10] so uh whenever you pray for your food
[10:13] even the smallest things can become one
[10:16] of the most biggest things in life so
[10:18] but if you walk by sight that means like
[10:22] if you don't pray your food you never
[10:24] know it can be in there like let's say
[10:26] if you're gonna have a steak let's say
[10:28] and if you don't pray for it it could be
[10:30] very pink inside or there could be a
[10:32] hair inside there and it could be a bad
[10:35] things and so that's why
[10:39] we walk by faith that's why we believe
[10:41] in the Lord and that's why we never give
[10:44] up on him
[10:44] for the smallest things in life so faith
[10:50] means like faith means you don't give up
[10:54] on the Lord he always believed in the
[10:56] Lord and so it was okay if I could tell
[10:59] you my story about like how I believed
[11:01] in the Lord
[11:02] okay here we go
[11:06] so like three years ago I don't know if
[11:08] you most of you know that I got this
[11:11] sickness it's it was called HSP and it's
[11:14] where I couldn't walk for a week and my
[11:16] stomach was really hurting and I would
[11:17] throw up a lot I'm not trying to be
[11:20] gross but it was pretty bad and I put a
[11:24] lot and so uh and so now but it lingered
[11:30] and so like now if I walk for like an
[11:34] hour even my feet would I would be like
[11:37] oh my legs hurt already
[11:39] oh I can't even walk no more so but I
[11:45] didn't give up on the world and sorry
[11:55] and so what I did is I just and what I
[12:00] did is well we went out with Ricky and
[12:05] they said that I have five different
[12:08] symptoms or sicknesses on me and one of
[12:12] them is called fibromyalgia it's where
[12:14] your nerves get really sensitive and
[12:16] like even if you touch me like this that
[12:20] would probably hurt for some of the
[12:21] people that have it really bad and so
[12:24] what I did is I put the devil to the
[12:26] test and I said to I was on my bus stop
[12:29] and on my school they had football
[12:32] tryouts and so what I did is I use my
[12:36] friends phone and I called my mom and I
[12:38] told her I'm gonna play football and I I
[12:42] don't care what anybody else thinks if
[12:45] my legs hurt or when I get hit my nose
[12:48] will be messed up or something
[12:52] I just believe in the word all the time
[12:56] and I tell you my best to always praise
[12:58] them and so yeah that's not right now
[13:03] and so I have five other sicknesses but
[13:08] we just wanted to find them out and we
[13:11] just wanted to leave it in the Lord's
[13:12] hands and so I'm gonna tell you another
[13:17] story it was about my grandma Martina
[13:25] yeah one time she got very sick and the
[13:33] doctor said that she only had 30 more
[13:34] minutes to live and that and she wasn't
[13:39] gonna make it
[13:39] and so sorry
[13:42] and so but my family didn't believe in
[13:47] that they always believed in the Lord
[13:49] and so my family they called the pastor
[13:57] and some of the ministers and and it was
[14:01] only two minutes left before she was
[14:03] kamek on the next thing you know she
[14:12] lived for 10 more years the doctors
[14:22] couldn't figure out why he lived that
[14:23] long and it's because she thought the
[14:26] work so much her family did too
[14:30] that's why we always had that's why most
[14:33] of us go to church a lot it's okay if
[14:36] you miss a day or two but try to make
[14:40] the effort to serve the Lord and all the
[14:43] time
[14:43] try Union if you even if you're at work
[14:47] or at school like at lunch maybe you
[14:51] could pray real quick if like for
[14:53] example the people that went to Africa
[14:56] maybe you could pray for someone else
[14:59] that can be sick or has an addiction or
[15:02] it could be something
[15:06] and so before it you go I would like to
[15:11] give a little testimony again well in
[15:15] the office my uncle said that he had a
[15:19] very bad stomach ache that he didn't
[15:23] really he just said that his stomach was
[15:25] hurting on and so whenever brother Diego
[15:29] come in came in and he started praying
[15:32] for him and whenever he was praying for
[15:35] him I just hear I heard a little you go
[15:40] cry I heard I just heard it and I didn't
[15:44] know what that meant but I felt like the
[15:46] Lord was with me and so I thank you all
[15:50] for this time and God bless you
[15:52] [Applause]
[16:24] amen amen god bless you how many happy
[16:28] to be in the house of the Lord amen
[16:30] god bless our our brother Israel for
[16:33] that that a testimony that he gave on on
[16:36] his life I I was actually there when he
[16:40] was when he was really really sick I
[16:43] remember him in the hospital and he was
[16:47] uh he was he was he was in a lot of pain
[16:51] it was screaming and everything but I
[16:53] remember him he was rebuking the devil
[16:56] and still praising God and I think that
[16:59] was awesome a man thank you
[17:03] Israel we appreciate that anyways guys
[17:06] my name is sergeant
[17:08] eagle-eye today and the Lord sent me
[17:11] today to talk to all of you because he
[17:14] loves you guys he really really loves
[17:17] you guys he loves the children I am a
[17:20] soldier of God God has he's trained me
[17:23] to protect to help to to love to do
[17:28] everything that he wants us to do and I
[17:31] want to share with you a few things that
[17:33] that we do um a lot there's a lot of
[17:36] soldiers of God we heard a soldier of
[17:38] God today preaching we heard one
[17:40] interpreting we have deacons and Usher's
[17:42] you guys are soldiers of God too and
[17:46] some of the things that we do that that
[17:49] our pastor wants us to do the Lord wants
[17:52] us to do is for example will come like
[17:54] on Monday mornings and we'll be in
[17:56] prayer at 5:30 in the morning and it's
[18:01] awesome guys because when we're here
[18:03] believe it or not I know I can speak for
[18:06] myself
[18:06] but when I'm when I'm here praying and
[18:08] all of a sudden it's the craziest thing
[18:10] because I'll get I'll get like a thought
[18:14] I'll get a thought all of a sudden while
[18:16] I'm praying about my brother here or my
[18:20] sister here or what it could be anybody
[18:23] in the church but the Lord puts things
[18:25] in your mind in your in your heart to
[18:28] start praying for a brother maybe maybe
[18:30] they're having a rough time and they
[18:31] need prayer or something like that and
[18:33] the Lord has us do that the Lord has us
[18:36] reading the Word of God that's it that's
[18:38] another thing that he has us doing these
[18:39] are all things that we do as soldiers of
[18:42] God we read the message we come to
[18:45] church we fellowship we do everything
[18:48] everything everything that we can
[18:50] possibly do to be soldiers of God and
[18:53] like I said I know that there's some
[18:55] soldiers here too um I have a bandana
[18:59] because believe it or not we fight
[19:01] demons we fight the devil and we fight
[19:04] demons and the Lord says you know what

[27:02] hard time in math okay I have a hard
[27:06] time Pat - that's crazy okay
[27:08] what about you huh PE yeah me too
[27:15] Wow jeez we have a lot of stuff in
[27:18] common okay my buddy over here what do
[27:20] you have
[27:22] in your school subjects okay okay what
[27:26] the thing about it is you guys is that
[27:29] if we're being realistic right we
[27:32] worship God and we're Christians and
[27:33] everything like that
[27:34] but the things that you mentioned are
[27:36] things in everyday life because we still
[27:38] live in this world right so I had those
[27:42] problems too when I was your age in math
[27:44] and different things whatever they were
[27:46] I had problems too okay because we're
[27:49] surrounded by the world right so I'm
[27:52] gonna give another example okay who
[27:55] wants to help me okay I need one of the
[27:57] girls to help me okay let me see Sophie
[28:01] come here come on up Sophie and then to
[28:08] let me out yeah come on come on you
[28:12] could come too come on okay all right so
[28:19] these girls are cracking up all right so
[28:21] let me let me give you guys an example
[28:23] okay I need you I'm gonna show you right
[28:30] now okay so we live in this world okay
[28:33] we're gonna say that this this this
[28:35] picture right here the water in this is
[28:38] is the world let's say that's the world
[28:40] okay and somebody without God without
[28:45] without being a Christian okay they have
[28:48] no protection from the world okay there
[28:51] is no protection whatsoever okay so
[28:54] we're gonna look here and this is the
[28:57] this is the person out in the world that
[28:59] has no protection whatsoever okay
[29:02] so one of your girls come okay I want
[29:06] you to put this in the water okay
[29:15] okay so remember okay this is the person
[29:19] that that has no that doesn't listen to
[29:22] God's word that doesn't know what a
[29:24] prophet is hasn't heard the message of
[29:27] the hour does it it doesn't do any of
[29:29] these things okay but yet they live in
[29:31] the world - but no protection right okay
[29:34] now you want to come here and you want
[29:36] to help me okay did you see the picture
[29:39] on that napkin you did okay I want you
[29:43] to pull it out and I want you to open it
[29:47] up open it up to show the face as best
[29:59] as you can okay okay right there what
[30:11] happened no protection from God or
[30:13] anything like that so look at the way
[30:15] this person ended up okay with holes in
[30:20] them they didn't listen to the pastor
[30:22] nothing like that so there was no
[30:24] protection so they ended up miserable
[30:26] they ended up long term without
[30:29] listening look at the way they ended up
[30:31] that's their life right there okay now
[30:34] what we're gonna do is we're gonna we're
[30:37] gonna have like one of you kids okay one
[30:40] of you guys that has the protection of
[30:42] God that listens to you the pasture
[30:43] listens to the ministry listens to
[30:46] everything that that that the Word of
[30:48] God says okay and we're gonna give
[30:50] another example okay come here Sophie
[30:53] okay I want you to put this in here this
[30:58] right here this is going to signify the
[31:01] protection of God okay so this is God's
[31:03] protection here okay remember this is
[31:06] the world okay so in God's protection I
[31:10] want you to push just push down real
[31:12] slowly okay all right okay right there
[31:16] okay thank you all right and God's
[31:19] protection this is going to be submerged
[31:21] in the world
[31:22] okay so we're all the way in can you
[31:27] guys
[31:28] I know it's a little hard to see but but
[31:30] this is the way it works okay you have
[31:33] the protection of God even though you're
[31:36] in the world there's there's there's a
[31:38] there's a protection around you guys
[31:40] okay so so whenever you go through life
[31:44] and you have different things happen to
[31:45] your life and stuff like that as long as
[31:48] you listen to God's Word and you're
[31:50] obedient to the pastor in the ministry
[31:52] and everything like that when you come
[31:54] out of that you come out okay and look
[31:58] what happens you're still good you see
[32:05] that so so that's why you guys okay
[32:08] that's why that's just an example to
[32:10] show you thank you girls I appreciate
[32:12] your help okay can we give them an
[32:14] applause so that's how God's protection
[32:20] works guys okay but we have to listen we
[32:24] always have to listen to what's being
[32:26] told to us what's being told to us again
[32:29] and I reiterate this a lot what's being
[32:32] told to us by our pasture by the
[32:33] assistant pastor the ministry the Word
[32:36] of God kids okay
[32:38] that's what we have to listen to now if
[32:40] you don't listen what happens how many
[32:42] know the story of Noah and the Ark who
[32:44] knows that story yeah okay
[32:47] what happened what happened all the
[32:54] people that didn't believe died right
[32:55] that's right okay what happened was Noah
[32:57] he had a message for everybody right and
[33:00] because because the world the world all
[33:03] around him was it was terrible it was
[33:06] bad there was their God looked down at
[33:08] the world and he saw and he just saw
[33:10] nothing but chaos just just bad stuff
[33:13] happening everywhere everywhere
[33:14] everywhere so he sent a message he sent
[33:18] Noah a message and he says you tell the
[33:20] people tell the people that I'm gonna
[33:22] destroy I'm gonna destroy the world I'm
[33:25] tired of this filthiness I'm tired of
[33:27] this and that and I'm gonna destroy them

[37:01] obey God's Word okay um now I wanna I
[37:05] wanna I want to talk to you guys about
[37:07] I'm not one of the last thing before we
[37:09] how many know the story how many know
[37:12] the story of the rich young ruler okay
[37:19] tell me a little bit about it
[37:30] because he was really rich okay that's
[37:33] right that's exactly right good job now
[37:35] this rich young ruler how many know what
[37:38] he wanted what did he he had everything
[37:40] he had money he had horses he had
[37:44] everything everything really money
[37:46] everything what do you what did he want
[37:50] power okay what else he had power but
[37:54] what else what else did he want anybody
[37:58] what do you want money okay he had money
[38:01] what he really really wanted and he went
[38:04] to Jesus okay
[38:05] he went to Jesus and told Jesus I want
[38:08] eternal life
[38:09] that's what he asked them how do I get
[38:11] eternal life okay now this is I need I'm
[38:16] gonna I'm gonna sit down here okay I'm
[38:19] gonna sit down right here with you guys
[38:20] and I need a volunteer who wants to be
[38:23] the rich young ruler in my region really
[38:27] yeah okay all right so this is the rich
[38:33] young ruler right here okay so the rich
[38:37] young ruler guys we see that he wanted
[38:39] an eternal life okay that's what he
[38:42] that's what he what he wanted and he
[38:44] would tell God and so he asked Jesus the
[38:47] question and Jesus said follow follow
[38:49] the commandments is what he told him in
[38:51] other words in in your in your guyses so
[38:54] you guys can understand me be good
[38:56] listen to your parents do all these
[38:58] things and that's awesome guys we need
[39:00] to do those things okay we need to do
[39:03] those things and the rich young ruler he
[39:06] told him he said you know what I've done
[39:08] all these things since I was born I've
[39:10] kept all these things and I've done him
[39:12] I've been good to my parents I pray I do
[39:15] all these things so then Jesus told him
[39:18] looked at him and told him well sell all
[39:21] that you have and follow me okay and
[39:24] we've heard this preached time and time
[39:26] again and maybe you guys have heard
[39:28] heard stories and stuff like that but
[39:30] what it boils down to kids is Jesus
[39:34] wanted to have a relationship with the
[39:37] rich young ruler that's what he wanted
[39:39] in the Bible he always refers to the
[39:42] rich young ruler
[39:44] as the rich young ruler he never calls
[39:47] him by name he never talked he never
[39:50] called him by name yet his friend that
[39:52] he loved Lazarus he called him by his
[39:54] named Lazarus when Lazarus died he said
[39:57] Lazarus wake up but the rich young ruler
[40:00] because there was no relationship he
[40:03] never referred to him by his name he
[40:06] always called him rich young ruler in
[40:08] the different verses that he speaks
[40:10] throughout the Bible he always called
[40:12] him that so he wants a relationship with
[40:14] you kids is what he wants that's what he
[40:17] wants and the rich young ruler was not
[40:19] gonna do that so thank you my buddy
[40:23] that's that's what he wants from you
[40:25] guys okay always remember always always
[40:28] remember that you have to be good you
[40:30] got to keep the commandments and
[40:31] everything like that but never never
[40:33] stop to search for that relationship
[40:37] with God okay and when you have a
[40:39] relationship with God kids it's not just
[40:42] a relationship that you get and it stays
[40:45] like that no because when you get a
[40:47] relationship you build off that
[40:50] relationship so you start a relationship
[40:52] and the relationship that you want to
[40:54] have with God is this is you and this is
[40:58] God this is our Lord Jesus Christ what
[41:01] you want to do is build off that and as
[41:03] you build you get closer and closer and
[41:05] closer and closer until you become so
[41:08] close with God in your relationship that
[41:11] you become one and that when I look at
[41:15] my brother here I don't see the
[41:17] difference if it's my brother or my Lord
[41:18] Jesus Christ and I see the Christ in my
[41:21] brother okay
[41:23] well guys that's what God wanted me to
[41:26] tell you guys remember keep our pastor
[41:29] in prayer god loves you guys Horus all
[41:32] his heart
[41:32] we love you all of our heart you guys
[41:35] are super valuable to us okay remember
[41:39] don't ever forget your value on how
