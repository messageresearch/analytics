[26:58] everyone got
[27:03] who's got it ready you got okay
[27:07] your sweetheart yeah thank you thank you
[27:20] according to all that i show you that is
[27:23] the pattern of the tabernacle
[27:25] and the pattern of all its furnishings
[27:28] just so you shall make it
[27:32] okay how about verse 40.
[27:36] verse 40.
[27:39] go ahead right there and look
[27:43] there that thou make them after the
[27:45] patterns
[27:46] which he showed thee in the mountain
[27:50] amen thank you brother sister you see
[27:52] brother moses
[27:54] he might have been a good builder but he
[27:57] was obedient to god when he's telling
[28:00] build it exactly according to the
[28:01] pattern that i show you know what
[28:03] another word for a pattern is a
[28:04] blueprint
[28:05] you don't got a blueprint you know what
[28:07] to build
[28:08] you know the measurements you know how
[28:10] to cut you see what happened
[28:12] i thought i knew what i was doing i'm in
[28:14] my house
[28:15] it was a little crooked and it fell down
[28:18] because i didn't do it according to
[28:20] blueprint and moses
[28:22] he was obedient he built it tabernacle
[28:24] exactly
[28:25] according to the pattern he saw i'm
[28:28] talking about
[28:29] the exact measurements i'm talking about
[28:31] the colors i'm talking about the skins
[28:33] exactly he didn't waver it was exactly
[28:37] here we go okay now
[28:40] i'm going to show you the blueprint
[28:42] today we're building the house here i'm
[28:44] building a house okay
[28:45] there's a blueprint go on put first
[28:48] picture
[28:52] there you go that
[28:56] is the pattern today
[29:01] is isn't it or not okay
[29:05] that is the body you know
[29:09] so you'll understand put the next one up
[29:13] there here that's what's called the body
[29:15] of the lord jesus christ
[29:18] now i know what y'all thinking we
[29:20] already learned this from the last
[29:22] person to talk here he taught us this we
[29:24] know this
[29:25] but you know what turn your bibles again
[29:29] let me tell you why i'm telling you
[29:31] again okay
[29:34] second peter
[29:37] 1 8.
[29:47] you got oh right there right there
[29:56] go ahead and read or if these eight
[29:58] angels
[30:00] for if these things be in you and abound
[30:04] they make you that ye shall neither be
[30:06] barren
[30:07] nor fruitful in the knowledge of our
[30:09] lord jesus christ
[30:12] go ahead verse 9
[30:15] but he that lacketh these things is
[30:17] blind and cannot see for afar off
[30:20] and has forgotten that he was purged
[30:22] from his old sins
[30:29] whether or for the rather bad
[30:32] brethren give diligence to make your
[30:36] calling and election sure
[30:37] for if you do these things ye shall
[30:39] never fail
[30:41] if ye shall do these things you
[30:44] shall never fail you shall never
[30:48] fall you know what give me verse 11 here
[30:52] for soul and entrance shall be
[30:54] ministered unto you abundantly in the
[30:56] everlasting kingdom of our lord
[30:58] and savior jesus christ next verse
[31:01] wherefore i will not be niggly
[31:07] okay you know what i'm talking about to
[31:09] put you always in the remembrance
[31:11] of these you know what i'm telling you
[31:13] so you can remember
[31:15] put you in the remembrance of these
[31:17] things though you know them
[31:19] you already know and you rehearse i'm
[31:21] reminding you
[31:22] and be established in the present
[31:25] truth next verse yeah i
[31:29] think it me as long as i am
[31:32] in this tabernacle to stir you up by
[31:36] putting you
[31:37] in remembrance
[31:41] so i got to remind you that's the body
[31:44] there go and put that
[31:45] picture again bro
[31:49] but when you decide to give your heart
[31:51] to the lord when you start your journey

[32:59] god isn't building a wall he's building
[33:02] a house
[33:03] you see there's many cuts and turns he's
[33:06] predicted here in the bible
[33:08] and the turns anybody could try to make
[33:11] a turn but it must be
[33:12] according to the blueprint
[33:16] if it isn't it's got to be torn
[33:20] down that means
[33:23] when you start your journey and you
[33:25] stray off
[33:26] and you fall and you talk to some of
[33:28] these older
[33:29] kids they went off the beaten path
[33:32] and they had to get torn down

[37:27] that's too many i'm gonna break it down
[37:29] for you a little bit okay if every
[37:31] person
[37:33] own their own small forest it would
[37:36] equal to about 400 trees
[37:38] per person not in here that's whole
[37:41] world
[37:43] you know what i'm talking about okay
[37:46] list goes on that's just one world and

[37:54] time to buy 10 million i just read you
[37:58] one but you times that by 10 million
[38:02] out of the trillions of billions of

[57:08] what a way to start out this year for me
[57:12] last year i prayed and i prayed and i
[57:15] said lord just
[57:15] don't forget about my boys whatever you
[57:18] do don't forget about my boys
[57:21] and he asked me this year he says dad i
[57:24] i wanna i wanna
[57:25] i want to go and do what everybody else
[57:26] is doing and give the heart to the lord
[57:29] and i said that's the wrong reason miho
[57:31] i said you give your heart to the lord
[57:33] because you want to
[57:34] because you know there's something
[57:36] missing in your life and because you
[57:38] feel a calling to him
[57:41] he read and he read and he prayed and he
[57:45] prayed
[57:46] and on on new year's eve night at our
[57:48] church service
[57:50] he heard take and eat and if you don't
[57:54] if you weren't baptized you couldn't
[57:56] take any more from him
[57:58] and he texts me right after church and
[58:00] he says dad
[58:01] i want to get baptized and today is the
[58:04] greatest joy in my heart
[58:06] because not only i can feel what the
[58:09] lord felt when he watched jesus go into
[58:11] the river
[58:12] and he he looked at him and with all
[58:14] gratitude and
[58:15] and just such a joy about him that he
[58:18] would say surely this
[58:19] is my beloved son i i
[58:22] with all my heart i am so proud of my
[58:24] boy and so proud that he found the lord
