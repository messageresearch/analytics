[10:49] [Music]
[10:50] [Applause]
[10:51] [Music]
[10:58] is
[11:01] we have come again tonight lord to
[11:03] attempt
[11:04] uh this meeting and to
[11:08] pray thee to open to us lord this
[11:12] a third seal of this book that it might
[11:15] be
[11:16] known to us that we would know what to
[11:20] do and how to live
[11:22] and how to be better christians
[11:25] now tonight we're going to read
[11:28] uh from this blessed old word again
[11:31] in the sixth chapter and we start
[11:34] tonight with the third
[11:36] seal and that is the fifth verse of
[11:39] fifth
[11:40] and sixth first now in the fifth verse
[11:44] and when he had opened the third seal
[11:48] i heard the third beast say come see
[11:52] and i'll be held in lower black horse
[11:54] and he that set on him had a
[11:56] pair of balances in his hand and i heard
[12:00] a voice
[12:01] in the midst of the four beasts saying a
[12:03] major wheat farm
[12:04] a penny and three measures of barley for
[12:07] a penny
[12:08] but see thou hurt not the oil and wine
[12:13] and there was no man in heaven
[12:16] no man on earth no man beneath the earth
[12:19] or nobody was even worthy to look at the
[12:23] book
[12:25] see now just think of that then the lamb
[12:28] comes forward
[12:29] and he takes it for god john was asked
[12:32] not to weep anymore he said
[12:34] behold the lion of judah
[12:37] has prevailed and and he can take the
[12:41] book and open it
[12:42] so he turned to look for a line and he
[12:45] saw
[12:45] a lamb the elder called
[12:49] a lion has prevailed but when he come
[12:52] and looked it was a land coming out
[12:54] from the toilet or he was bleeding
[12:58] for the people intercessing
[13:01] for the people until the last
[13:06] that was put on the lamb's book of life
[13:08] before the foundation world
[13:10] come in there's just going to be so
[13:14] many of them there and that's it that's
[13:17] all
[13:18] the others won't even want to come and
[13:20] have no desire to come again
[13:22] and so then when that last
[13:25] soul comes in then the time of
[13:27] redemption is
[13:28] finished then the lamb comes forth the
[13:32] plane
[13:33] his rights to what he has redeemed
[13:38] and that's all creation then
[13:41] he said he is worthy to take the book of
[13:44] redemption now
[13:45] it doesn't belong back to the judge
[13:48] anymore
[13:49] it belongs to the redeemer and he's done
[13:52] done the work of redemption now comes
[13:55] christ you see him
[13:56] in the 10th chapter of revelations this
[13:59] right let's discuss him if you'll notice
[14:03] the first rider who he was and we found
[14:06] out last night
[14:07] scripturally that the second rider was
[14:11] exactly the same man
[14:13] only he was on another horse what
[14:16] happened
[14:17] he changed his ministry right
[14:20] we found out he was an antichrist and it
[14:24] changed his position
[14:26] now watch where we have tonight that
[14:27] other church age now
[14:30] or come down to the third church agent
[14:33] just exactly on the third church age is
[14:35] just like like the third horse
[14:37] this rider is the same one but another
[14:40] stage
[14:41] of his ministry now john sees him
[14:45] on a black horse he changed something
[14:48] else
[14:51] he started riding him
[14:55] in the time of the dark ages
[14:58] that's what the dark horse represented
[15:01] the dark ages for
[15:03] it was a time of midnight to the true
[15:06] believers
[15:07] that was left his balances
[15:10] are his scales in his hand you see
[15:14] calling out measure of wheat for a penny
[15:16] and three measures of barley
[15:18] for a penny see actually
[15:22] that is wheat and barley is natural
[15:26] staff of life that's what bran stops me
[15:29] from
[15:30] but you see he was charging for this
[15:35] what it means that he was
[15:38] charging his subjects for the kind
[15:43] of the hope of life that he was standing
[15:45] out to them
[15:46] by making it started in that very time
[15:48] of making them
[15:50] pay for prayer
[15:54] charging for praying they still do it
[15:58] no penis because what was he doing
[16:01] capturing the wealth of the world
[16:06] the scale of weighing out
[16:09] measure of wheat or if any three
[16:11] measures of barley for a penny
[16:13] the rider on a black horse
[16:16] see he was making stripping his
[16:20] subjects of their money when the bible
[16:23] predicts that it holds about the wealth
[16:25] of the world now
[16:27] notice you see where that old money
[16:29] taken in church comes from
[16:31] [Music]
[16:33] to build an organization a big something
[16:35] million dollars charging for
[16:36] prayer by the priest to pray people out
[16:40] of purgatory
[16:42] charging i'm taking this round of
[16:43] history charging for
[16:45] i guess it's novena i guess what
[16:47] everybody knows
[16:48] don't be here i guess that's something
[16:50] you have to do you know some penance
[16:51] somebody had to charge for that
[16:58] notice here's the good part now
[17:02] notice that thou
[17:04] hurt not this wild
[17:08] [Music]
[17:10] just a little bit of it left brother
[17:12] don't you touch that
[17:14] [Music]
[17:17] now oral is symbolizes the spirit the
[17:21] holy spirit amen
[17:22] i'll give you a few verses if you want
[17:24] yours two scriptures in leviticus
[17:25] 8 12 where aaron before he went ahead be
[17:28] anointed with the order you know and
[17:29] in psychiat 4 12 the oil coming pouring
[17:32] through the pipes and said this is my
[17:34] spirit
[17:34] or another thing if you want to see
[17:36] matthew 14 25
[17:38] there was a foolish virgin 25 3 the
[17:41] foolish virgin
[17:42] had no oral no spirit and
[17:45] matthew 25 4 the wise virgin had all in
[17:49] her lane
[17:49] spirit-filled spouse
[17:52] oral tempify spirit and
[17:56] wine symbolizes
[18:00] stimulation of revelation
[18:06] oh i like to run over the place when
[18:08] they wake up the neighborhood the lord
[18:10] showed me that
[18:10] [Music]
[18:12] stimulation of revelation
[18:15] okay all in one
[18:18] in the bible is associated together
[18:22] always i got the concordance look the
[18:25] street of that lag
[18:26] is like that where wine and oil goes
[18:28] together all the time
[18:30] see because
[18:33] revelation has been given of a truth
[18:37] of god and the true believer filled with
[18:40] oil and the revelation
[18:43] is revealed the stimulation becomes so
[18:46] great
[18:47] that he makes him behave himself a
[18:50] [Music]
[18:54] normal
[18:57] [Music]
[19:05] what does it say
[19:08] to this rider in black don't you hurt
[19:12] my wine and my oil don't you touch it
[19:17] my wine oil i've got just a little bit
[19:21] of it down there but he's still a little
[19:22] bit there
[19:30] that's up to you you're going to pay for
[19:32] it down there but when you come across
[19:34] that wine or you leave them
[19:35] [Music]
[19:37] i was here and i and i heard a voice
[19:40] in the midst of the four beasts what was
[19:43] it
[19:44] the lamb
[19:57] [Music]
[20:02] [Applause]
[20:05] that bar well now sir not the four
[20:07] beasts but the lamb was the one that
[20:09] said it
[20:10] oh my god
[20:13] the lamb not the four beasts that
[20:15] announced this the lamb said itself
[20:17] well to the best of my understanding
[20:21] and the best of that i know
[20:25] and with all that i believe in my heart
[20:29] that's the true meaning of those three
[20:32] seals i want to thank god for it
[20:35] i'll say this that it's a revelation
[20:40] that he give me he gave that
[20:43] to me the revelation and i do believe
[20:47] that we're
[20:48] living in the last days
[20:52] [Music]
[21:00] wonderful
[21:05] [Applause]

[48:31] does that resonate with anyone here
[48:32] today
[49:09] we have been so blessed to be able to
[49:10] have received the revelation of jesus
[49:14] christ
[49:18] one of the greatest privileges that i
[49:19] have had in my life
[49:23] is to be able to work with my with my
[49:25] uncle abraham

[49:38] i continue to learn continuous
[49:42] i have been blessed so much
[49:45] and the more we dig
[49:50] and that's why the book of revelations
[49:54] is my book liberty apocalypse
[50:22] okay i want to know is there anybody is

[51:46] okay i want you to stand up if it's your
[51:48] book
[52:00] there's no demon in hell that can
[52:15] we see that the book of revelations
[52:18] is our book my book
[52:22] and your book those that
[52:26] are part of the bride of jesus christ
[52:29] i came across a video this past week
[52:35] and it happened to be an atheist
[52:38] talking to a bunch of uh of college
[52:41] students
[52:44] and they were he was there answering
[52:46] questions
[52:49] anything that had to do with religion
[52:52] an atheist answering questions that had
[52:55] to do with religion
[53:06] the more i heard him i said my goodness
[53:10] he seemed to have a wealth of knowledge
[53:22] and i don't i don't go around listening
[53:24] to a bunch of videos on atheists
[53:41] the look of bewilderment in the young
[53:44] people's
[53:45] eyes and their face
[53:53] as the moment he would begin to answer
[53:56] the moment
[53:58] you could see them right away
[54:02] began to question what they claimed that
[54:04] they believed
[54:07] and i said that's where we live today
[54:10] it's so easy to get influenced by
[54:12] something you hear
[54:14] the said influence yeah somebody that
[54:15] speaks very eloquently
[54:18] very educated somebody who's read a lot
[54:20] of books
[54:22] somebody that has studied a lot
[54:25] of mucho i remember one student
[54:27] specifically
[54:30] asked him well what about all the
[54:32] prophecies of the bible because he said
[54:33] the bible and
[54:34] and jesus probably didn't exist
[54:40] he says uh uh uh what about the prophecy
[54:42] of the birth of jesus
[54:46] he went on rambling blah blah blah blah
[54:47] blah blah
[54:49] didn't make sense
[55:19] jesus fulfilled over 600 different
[55:23] prophecies of the old testament jesus
[55:27] and many of them were fulfilled in the
[55:30] last seven or eight hours of his life
[56:00] he said well jesus didn't tell the truth
[56:02] well jesus
[56:04] because he said that some that were
[56:06] present would see his second coming
[56:12] oh if i could have just had a few
[56:13] minutes with that
[56:27] with an open heart
[56:57] lorraine that is my wife
[57:00] and if somebody says she don't exist
[57:02] she's not there's not a real sister
[57:04] lorraine
[57:06] really because just because you've never
[57:08] met her somebody's never met her
[57:10] does
[57:25] these are the things that i want you
[57:26] young people especially to really get a
[57:28] hold of so
[57:30] in his captain you want prophecy
[57:35] the whole book of revelations is one
[57:38] continuous prophet
[57:44] what are the odds of a of an entire book
[57:49] coming to pass
[58:05] 100 with god
[58:15] goes on to say i don't believe anything
[58:17] that's spiritual or
[58:18] revelation or any of that kind of stuff
[58:33] you've just denied your very existence
[58:37] existencia for the real you and i
[58:41] are not the body we live in the real you
[58:44] and i
[58:44] it is the spirit and soul that dwells
[58:47] inside of that blind
[58:52] think about that for a moment as i
[58:55] as i continue to hear in a little bit
[59:00] i said my goodness
[59:16] that they're prepared when they hear
[59:19] something
[59:20] that is an uncertain sound
[59:25] so easy to be influenced nowadays
[59:29] and at the end of his this discourse
[59:32] i i i found out as i was listening to
[59:35] him
[59:37] that everything that he said
[59:41] he was quoting some other fallible man
[59:44] el esta
[59:58] and in the midst of it all i'm saying
[1:00:00] you do know that those are men
[1:00:05] you do know that scientists are men
[1:00:08] you do know that all that write those
[1:00:09] books they're men
[1:00:13] and you decided to take what they wrote
[1:00:18] and you came up with your own conclusion
[1:00:21] i would rather take my chances
[1:00:25] on 40 writers
[1:01:09] when i looked at that i said my goodness
[1:01:12] not one of them that he that he quoted
[1:01:16] could claim that their findings were a
[1:01:18] hundred percent correct or accurate
[1:01:36] inconclusively
[1:01:38] yet everything we believe
[1:01:41] is not just factual
[1:01:44] but it's relevant it's true
[1:01:48] and it continues to come to pass
[1:01:59] because there's a prophetic class of
[1:02:02] people
[1:02:04] when they
[1:02:18] they
[1:02:32] and they find out
[1:02:39] [Applause]
[1:02:42] only a prophetic class of people
[1:02:46] know that
[1:03:14] true because that
[1:03:17] is becoming this esso
[1:03:21] because that eso is becoming
[1:03:25] this and this yester
[1:03:28] is let's let's go on and let's as we as
[1:03:33] we get this foundation built
[1:03:36] in the message the revelation of jesus
[1:03:37] christ
[1:03:40] this meaning the book of revelations is
[1:03:54] you're not going to say nothing no it's
[1:03:56] not
[1:04:07] it is the most official book is
[1:04:15] my goodness this is the only book that
[1:04:18] christ
[1:04:20] put his seal upon it
[1:04:25] it starts off with a blessing
[1:04:28] and it ends with a curse
[1:04:33] and curse it is he that takes anything
[1:04:35] out of it
[1:04:38] it is the only book that christ wrote
[1:04:41] himself
[1:04:44] you say but he wrote the ten
[1:04:45] commandments he wrote it with his finger
[1:04:49] amen and the jews hold on to that
[1:05:05] but the bride holds on to this
[1:05:22] the book of revelation of the apocalypse
[1:05:24] your book
[1:05:25] is your book
[1:05:28] your book all right satan hates your
[1:05:31] book
[1:05:44] anything he despises most is genesis and
[1:05:48] revelations
[1:06:01] saying that it's not authentic
[1:06:15] and you know why he does it is
[1:06:29] the book of genesis the first and the
[1:06:30] last
[1:06:32] genesis has more symbols because
[1:06:35] it's a book of prophecy
[1:06:39] it's a prophetic book so brother sam
[1:06:44] your book is a prophetic book
[1:06:49] my that's my book therefore it has to be
[1:06:53] understood by a theologian
[1:07:26] any smart educated people here hinders
[1:07:30] even if you don't raise your hand there
[1:07:31] we have we have some very intelligent
[1:07:33] people
[1:07:34] but it's not understood because of your
[1:07:36] intellect
[1:07:38] it has to be understood by a
[1:07:40] professional
[1:07:44] [Applause]
[1:07:54] a prophetic
[1:08:36] hmm
[1:08:45] [Applause]
[1:09:18] people
[1:09:32] but to the ones who are the lovers of
[1:09:34] god's word
[1:09:39] i know many love to watch tv television
[1:09:42] they're lovers of so
[1:09:46] one division they don't even have to put
[1:09:49] the lines where that came from
[1:09:53] somebody was telling me the other day
[1:09:54] i'll give myself stuck somewhere
[1:09:58] tell you what it is
[1:10:03] but this can only be revealed to
[1:10:08] lovers of the word solos
[1:10:11] am i talking to anybody that's
[1:10:28] therefore when we see the manifold
[1:10:30] revelation of our lord
[1:10:34] who he is what he is
[1:10:38] if any person shall add something to
[1:10:40] that
[1:10:42] you've ruined it all come on you got to
[1:10:45] follow me this way
[1:10:47] if anyone adds anything to that
[1:10:51] then the this doesn't come out right
[1:10:54] because this is
[1:11:09] many have tried to say that something
[1:11:11] later than that
[1:11:15] that but that that's the book of
[1:11:18] revelation
[1:11:19] but that is the complete
[1:11:23] revelation of the lord jesus
[1:11:37] but we love it
[1:11:53] you will recall that i mentioned at the
[1:11:54] beginning of this message
[1:12:02] the actual revelation of jesus himself
[1:12:33] just take ordinary studying
[1:12:48] that means
[1:13:02] it will require the ability to hear from
[1:13:04] god
[1:13:08] it will require supernatural instruction
[1:13:13] not just a student comparing verse to
[1:13:16] verses
[1:13:30] how we need
[1:14:11] she's the only one
[1:14:25] but very few
[1:14:40] making it make it as simple as possible
[1:14:47] that's why as we have spoken in the time
[1:14:49] in times past
[1:14:51] what is the attraction
[1:14:55] there's an attraction a prophet comes on
[1:14:57] the scene there's an attraction
[1:15:00] amen there was an attraction in our day
[1:15:07] a true sign
[1:15:35] when those that are believers
[1:16:04] the attraction
[1:16:29] but only a prophetic class can connect
[1:16:32] the dots
[1:16:48] this is sunday school we want to see if
[1:16:50] we want to see about learning this
[1:16:51] morning
[1:16:56] and being assembled together with them
[1:16:57] commanded them that they should not
[1:16:59] depart from
[1:17:00] jerusalem but wait for the promise of
[1:17:02] the father
[1:17:03] which saith he ye have heard of me
[1:17:13] terry means to wait
[1:17:17] and we have a hard time waiting
[1:17:21] we struggle because we are too
[1:17:23] distracted
[1:17:26] a lot of things distract us
[1:17:43] what he had promised to that was going
[1:17:45] to come
[1:17:56] how many are really here this morning
[1:18:00] make sure you pinch yourself but you
[1:18:02] could say we work long
[1:18:03] hours and we give everything to our jobs
[1:18:07] when we come to church and we're just
[1:18:08] filming
[1:18:23] i'll send the holy ghost upon you
[1:18:29] it shall abide with you forever
[1:18:33] even the spirit of truth who the world
[1:18:35] cannot receive
[1:18:38] what will it be like when the holy ghost
[1:18:40] comes
[1:18:42] in the conversation of the father
[1:18:46] he told us to wait what is the
[1:18:50] what will it be how will we know
[1:19:07] just like jesus
[1:19:11] because in him was the fullness
[1:19:14] and if we are to receive a portion of it
[1:19:18] and it's his life yes how can we
[1:19:20] actually
[1:19:48] he
[1:20:15] that's what the holy ghost was given for
[1:20:17] it
[1:20:20] is this when i look in the mirror
[1:20:24] that was spoken
[1:20:28] and you're gonna find out that in our
[1:20:30] lives
[1:20:44] this
[1:20:58] either
[1:21:12] this it's the answer to those questions
[1:21:17] if you don't know what this is
[1:21:21] you'll never answer the question believe
[1:21:24] this
[1:21:24] thou this
[1:21:35] what is he doing he's bringing it to our
[1:21:37] time
[1:21:39] he didn't say believe is thou that no no
[1:21:43] he never he brought it to us and he says
[1:21:46] believe us
[1:21:46] thou this this that is right before your
[1:21:54] eyes
[1:22:06] when the prophecy is fulfilling
[1:22:22] that
[1:22:35] which was spoken by jeremy the prophet
[1:22:41] we have the prophets you have the that
[1:22:45] you but you're having a hard time with
[1:22:47] this
[1:22:50] that's okay for my brother or the pastor
[1:22:53] or my parents
[1:22:56] but it's not okay
[1:23:00] it was that which was spoken unto you by
[1:23:04] god
[1:23:18] that's where people
[1:23:45] we've never been able to get over it and
[1:23:48] we live
[1:23:49] today in the presence always looking at
[1:23:53] that
[1:23:54] and that event yes it's what ends up
[1:23:58] defining us defeating
[1:24:42] i listened to a man just one day i won't
[1:24:45] say names
[1:24:47] because it doesn't matter it doesn't
[1:24:48] help anymore
[1:24:50] but he was pointing at an event that had
[1:24:52] happened to him
[1:24:53] 20 some years ago
[1:24:57] and he kept saying and then this is when
[1:24:59] this happened yes this happened
[1:25:02] and i was like poor man
[1:25:05] he got stuck and he became
[1:25:24] same story you sit down with people and
[1:25:26] they'll tell you the same stories
[1:25:29] sometimes i say brother sister you
[1:25:31] you've told me that
[1:25:32] you're going 100 times and i see them
[1:25:36] they're stuck
[1:25:38] and that's all they
[1:25:46] you went through that it's fine but but
[1:25:49] you gotta grow from that
[1:25:51] you can't
[1:26:01] i'm not talking to the average church
[1:26:03] church member
[1:26:05] you're talking to the people
[1:26:20] now watch this now romans 4 18 romano
[1:26:24] squadron
[1:26:25] in english to save time who against hope
[1:26:28] believed in hope that he might become
[1:26:31] the father of
[1:26:32] many nations according to
[1:26:35] that which was spoken
[1:26:39] so shall thy seed be
[1:26:44] it was spoken over here so shall i see
[1:27:08] [Applause]
[1:27:29] don't you love it when you've been sick
[1:27:32] no i'm not being sick
[1:27:35] when you've been sick and god heals you
[1:27:40] and you look at your healing i've
[1:27:42] struggled
[1:27:43] for years and you look at your healing
[1:27:46] mira
[1:27:47] your healing is the this
[1:27:50] and the promise that ask anything in my
[1:27:54] name
[1:28:26] what has to happen my mind
[1:28:31] had to submit to the word
[1:28:36] come on now i'm going to say it again my
[1:28:38] mind has to submit to the word
[1:30:02] that's when this is
[1:30:09] one of our days one of these days our
[1:30:12] whole being
[1:30:14] will completely submit to the word
[1:30:42] only those whose names are written in
[1:30:44] the lamb's book of life will not be
[1:30:46] deceived
[1:30:57] this is
[1:31:12] so the church was contaminated
[1:31:28] this
[1:31:52] and right now the holy spirit is wanting
[1:31:53] to come into you
[1:31:55] wanting to reveal things

[1:34:46] that's okay we'll still go forward
[1:34:51] just think this is in the message thirst
[1:34:55] just think father how perverted that
[1:35:00] he can make that's that spirit of
[1:35:03] antichrist that he can make
[1:35:05] the real true word
[1:35:08] how they can say oh we believe the bible
[1:35:12] come upon the siblings
[1:35:25] we don't believe this
[1:35:31] we believe this was for another age
[1:35:38] we believe this is
[1:35:42] because some denomination twisted our
[1:35:44] minds into that cesspool
[1:35:50] so we can't believe that this that it
[1:35:53] really is
[1:36:30] [Music]
[1:36:31] ain't nobody going to tell you anything
[1:36:33] different different
[1:36:51] word it's just there's so many things
[1:36:52] that are just so beautiful that are in
[1:36:53] the scripture
[1:36:56] peter said that on the day of pentecost
[1:37:00] this is that esto is
[1:37:16] why do you think they were doing it for
[1:37:18] for those 10 days in the upper room
[1:37:21] they were waiting yeah also i believe
[1:37:24] going through the scriptures
[1:37:30] i'll pour out my spirit
[1:38:00] how many are getting me this morning i'm
[1:38:02] making this as easy but watch this now
[1:38:05] acts chapter 2 verse 14.
[1:38:09] but peter standing up with the 11.
[1:38:12] lifted up his voice and said unto them
[1:38:56] is
[1:39:01] [Laughter]
[1:39:10] revelations
[1:39:38] but it
[1:39:47] that i will pour out my spirit
[1:39:52] upon all
[1:40:07] but the romanian people flesh i'll pour
[1:40:10] out my spirit and your sons and
[1:40:11] daughters shall prophesy
[1:40:15] why is this so significant significantly
[1:40:17] because the holy spirit
[1:40:20] had only
[1:40:34] in the body of jesus was a fullness
[1:40:38] when that body was taken up
[1:40:41] he rips the spirit out and he sends it
[1:40:45] back to the church
[1:40:47] now watch why that's so important
[1:40:50] because up to that point
[1:40:52] it was in him the fullness but on the
[1:40:55] day of pentecost
[1:40:57] he pours out his spirit there
[1:41:00] but it's not until the end time
[1:41:16] i hope that you get this especially this
[1:41:19] is that
[1:41:20] is the promise of the father this is
[1:41:22] what's happening
[1:41:26] but once his spirit is poured out into
[1:41:28] the church
[1:41:30] it
[1:41:44] but in the end
[1:41:59] from son of god to son of man
[1:42:03] it's a change it's coming around the
[1:42:04] corner now
[1:42:06] and when everyone is waiting over here
[1:42:09] they're saying this is that
[1:42:10] this is that even today
[1:42:25] this is
[1:42:57] [Applause]
[1:43:08] peter being filled with the holy ghost
[1:43:11] he understood there were parts of that
[1:43:14] joel's prophecy
[1:43:16] and that the only parts of that prophecy
[1:43:18] that was fulfilled
[1:43:21] was fulfilled at that moment was the
[1:43:24] first part that he said and he said this
[1:43:26] is that which was spoken
[1:43:30] but the rest of joel's prophecy was to
[1:43:33] be fulfilled at the end especially
[1:43:36] watch this now that's why when the holy
[1:43:38] ghost fell
[1:43:40] and we get that what what what did it do
[1:43:42] can you say they said this is that
[1:43:45] surely it was this was
[1:43:48] that is
[1:44:05] now the prophetic class that catches
[1:44:07] this
[1:44:09] they were okay with as long as the
[1:44:12] revelation of jesus being son of god
[1:44:18] as long as worshipping in the spirit i'm
[1:44:20] going to speak to you
[1:44:21] all we love the lord of the lord is good
[1:44:24] you're okay with this
[1:44:27] but when a prophet walks out on the
[1:44:29] scene
[1:44:30] you're not okay with this
[1:44:42] that was him getting his spirit and
[1:44:44] pouring it out
[1:44:46] you get it come
[1:45:00] the holy spirit
[1:45:14] fulfilled
[1:45:29] [Applause]
[1:45:43] i gotta i gotta just take i gotta get
[1:45:45] calm because this is this is
[1:45:46] i want you to get this here comes the
[1:45:49] prophetic class
[1:45:50] acts 2 17.
[1:45:54] i'm going to go 16 first it says this is
[1:45:56] that which was spoken of the prophet
[1:45:58] joel
[1:45:58] semicolon
[1:46:03] and then he turns and begins to speak of
[1:46:07] another day
[1:46:09] because what was going on there was not
[1:46:11] the last days
[1:46:14] peter knew that there was a manifold
[1:46:16] revolution
[1:46:22] now he stops and he says
[1:46:38] they're all stuck on i'll pour my spirit
[1:46:40] out
[1:46:42] here in the revelation for the last days
[1:47:31] [Music]
[1:47:40] why is this so significant significant
[1:47:43] is because the holy spirit
[1:47:44] had to that point as i said had only
[1:47:46] embodied himself in jesus christ
[1:48:27] and when that spirit began to be began
[1:48:29] to pour out
[1:48:44] they're stuck in feeling
[1:48:58] apostles
[1:49:26] jesus
[1:49:31] [Applause]
[1:50:09] don't say that i'm saying but if i claim
[1:50:12] to be something
[1:50:14] and i'm just repeating what another
[1:50:16] prophet
[1:50:20] okay he said that i said
[1:51:09] amen come on now
[1:51:14] there has to be scripture i'm going to
[1:51:16] say it again
[1:51:18] there has to be
[1:52:00] who
[1:52:14] lucha
[1:52:22] and those people that follow are the
[1:52:24] prophetic classes
[1:52:28] they are the heirs
[1:52:55] for without the ministry of the son of
[1:52:58] man
[1:53:00] the title deed book of redemption
[1:53:09] but jesus died he gave his life
[1:53:13] that's wonderful somebody had to claim
[1:53:15] it
[1:53:17] that's right and if there was no one
[1:53:19] worthy to take it
[1:53:22] then it would stay there in the
[1:53:36] a prophetic class a prophetic
[1:53:40] oh my god can i have like maybe like 15
[1:53:43] minutes or so
[1:53:44] yeah all right let's go
[1:53:48] we were up late so you're not the only
[1:53:49] one that's up
[1:53:53] early late the morning who knows what
[1:53:54] time and the phone was going off and his
[1:53:56] brothers
[1:53:58] his brother's sick and his sister's
[1:53:59] sickness
[1:54:01] all this coming in i'm like praise god
[1:54:03] what else can i say about praise
[1:54:24] that's why i had to preach this morning
[1:54:26] i think mother abraham i said brother
[1:54:27] abraham i don't know how long we'll be
[1:54:28] with my dad but
[1:54:29] and he was raised you just tell me i'll
[1:54:31] be ready to go
[1:54:34] leah
[1:55:16] how
[1:55:46] this almost always points to something
[1:55:48] or someone
[1:55:49] present
[1:55:53] that you is many times something that
[1:55:56] has already been said or spoken
[1:56:00] that becomes what we fix our vision is
[1:56:03] that right brother jerry
[1:56:04] okay how did you say that brother jerry
[1:56:09] the one that's looking after that el
[1:56:11] camino is the only one that can say
[1:56:13] this is that you cannot he's the one
[1:56:16] that can point out
[1:56:19] that's right and that is used when
[1:56:21] describing something
[1:56:23] beforehand yes
[1:56:26] or something but this it comes to the
[1:56:29] present
[1:56:31] and he's the one that is pointing out
[1:56:33] that
[1:56:36] i was always intrigued as i said
[1:56:40] brother branham when he explains matthew
[1:56:42] 16.
[1:56:44] on this rock i'll build my church so
[1:56:46] what is that it always intrigued me
[1:56:49] you would say the catholic church said
[1:56:50] it was built upon peter
[1:57:06] you know sometimes nowadays we say why
[1:57:08] does that matter
[1:57:12] we just believe jesus don't matter
[1:57:16] to a prophetic class
[1:57:20] wasn't going to build it upon peter nor
[1:57:22] upon
[1:57:37] and i'm going to go down this chapter
[1:57:38] and i have like i said about 10 12
[1:57:40] minutes that i that
[1:57:42] i'll try to try to keep my word the best
[1:57:44] i can
[1:57:48] when i look at this
[1:58:01] and i'm just going to read this because
[1:58:02] there's a lot of scriptures here i just
[1:58:04] want to read it just in english
[1:58:06] but he can interpret when i when i when
[1:58:08] i i bring something up and
[1:58:10] watch this now verse 14 then those men
[1:58:12] when they had seen the miracle that
[1:58:13] jesus did
[1:58:14] said this is of a truth
[1:58:31] this is
[1:58:46] to make him
[1:58:55] he knew that they were trying to make
[1:58:57] him savia king
[1:59:00] but
[1:59:10] wait a minute those are some good grapes
[1:59:14] oh my god
[1:59:19] he knew that they were trying to make
[1:59:21] the this at that time
[1:59:25] the that was not to be fulfilled
[1:59:36] he said i would not allow myself to be
[1:59:37] taken by force
[1:59:41] he knew that they would be getting ahead
[1:59:43] of god's plan
[1:59:46] he was to be king and the people that
[1:59:48] believed him knew it
[1:59:51] but not at that time he was a redeemer
[1:59:56] going into a priesthood
[2:00:10] misinterpret
[2:00:14] now watch john 6 27 now and juan says
[2:00:18] so much and i and i feel bad when i skip
[2:00:20] things because
[2:00:22] it's so relevant
[2:00:38] labor not for the meat no which parishes
[2:00:44] but for that meat
[2:00:49] everlasting life this
[2:01:02] which the son of man prophet
[2:01:06] shall give unto you for him hath the
[2:01:09] hath god the father sealed
[2:01:12] then said they unto him what shall we do
[2:01:15] that we might work the works of god
[2:01:17] jesus answered and said unto them go
[2:01:19] ahead and interpret
[2:01:48] jesus said fairly barely i said to you
[2:01:51] moses gave you not says no
[2:01:56] that breath he gave you bread
[2:01:59] yeah but not that bread
[2:02:16] is
[2:02:30] you the true bread from heaven
[2:02:34] and then verse 34 unto him lord evermore
[2:02:38] give us this bread
[2:02:43] oh this is that is
[2:02:46] now they're asking him now he said lord
[2:02:49] senor give us
[2:02:50] present this breath
[2:02:53] this is that jesus said yes
[2:02:56] i am the brethren
[2:03:00] [Applause]
[2:03:40] it came
[2:03:52] he went from i am the bread of life
[2:03:54] watch this is a tremendous thing
[2:03:57] he now says this is the bread
[2:04:05] for a moment because once again here he
[2:04:08] goes
[2:04:09] he says i am the bread of life but he
[2:04:12] also knew
[2:04:14] the words he was speaking they are
[2:04:17] spirit
[2:04:18] so the spirit of their life he also knew
[2:04:22] that yeah
[2:04:49] this is the bread which come down from
[2:04:52] heaven
[2:04:54] if any man eat thereof and will not die
[2:04:58] watch as he goes on jesus said
[2:05:02] unto them barely i send you except ye
[2:05:04] eat the flesh of the son of man
[2:05:06] and drink his blood you have no life in
[2:05:09] you
[2:05:12] verse 53. you can read that jesus
[2:05:18] is
[2:05:21] and then verse 58 says this
[2:05:25] is that bread
[2:05:32] which came down from heaven not as your
[2:05:35] fathers did eat man
[2:05:39] he that eateth of this breath
[2:05:45] shall live forever
[2:06:09] and that's why he's saying this is
[2:06:12] that bread so he said it's the same
[2:06:28] in his
[2:06:42] outside
[2:06:55] i will be in my body
[2:07:10] you'll never
[2:07:24] musicians up here because then i won't
[2:07:26] stop but i still got like
[2:07:29] two or three minutes watch this now
[2:07:33] she's the only one that can say this is
[2:07:34] that
[2:07:36] because the ultimate revelation young
[2:07:38] people
[2:07:52] is
[2:08:09] how many ever asked yourself the
[2:08:10] question when he talks about sons and
[2:08:13] daughters
[2:08:14] could this be that could i be
[2:08:17] the fulfillment of that satan wants to
[2:08:33] [Music]
[2:08:34] is
[2:08:47] but you've got to take it yourself
[2:08:50] to become part of it then you and the
[2:08:53] message
[2:08:54] become one then the anointing's with you
[2:09:00] as it is with others
[2:09:15] is there anyone here that can say
[2:09:30] this is that which was spoken by joelle

[2:12:34] brother branham preaches the message
