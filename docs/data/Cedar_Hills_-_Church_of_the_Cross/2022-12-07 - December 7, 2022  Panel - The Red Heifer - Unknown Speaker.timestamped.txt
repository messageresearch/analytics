[22:45] amen this is right up his alley so we
[22:48] yes

[22:53] and we expect the greatest that God has
[22:56] to offer amen
[22:59] we're going to go and start this with
[23:01] the word of prayer as we go to the
[23:02] father and Allah
[23:07] our gracious most Heavenly Father
[23:11] Lord how we love you tonight Lord
[23:15] being our creator our God is
[23:19] as we come taking your word not lightly

[23:29] Lord
[23:32] or we don't want to displace your word
[23:34] misplace it
[23:38] but Lord but under the inspiration that
[23:40] you've given us Lord we surrender
[23:42] ourselves
[23:46] Lord May what we have to bring
[23:51] Lord may your word just go and reach
[23:54] your people tonight lord
[23:57] it's nothing that comes from us but it
[24:00] comes directly from your throne
[24:04] in your precious name we ask all things
[24:09] amen amen you may be seated
[24:13] amen we're this first scripture we're
[24:16] going to read is a little lengthy so
[24:17] yesterday
[24:20] so we kind of just wanted for right now
[24:24] we like to stand during the reading the
[24:26] word but this scripture we want to take
[24:28] it but before we get started
[24:33] you know our pastor's birthdays today we
[24:39] from the bottom of our hearts
[24:44] you know we just we want to thank him
[24:46] and his family
[24:48] you know for over for me it's been but I
[24:52] mean 23 24 years that we've we've been
[24:55] here
[24:59] let's pick this up from the ground
[25:03] he showed us who God really is
[25:08] and he's lived the Life of Christ
[25:15] all my life to him
[25:18] I know the rest of you could probably
[25:20] say the same thing and he is
[25:25] he loves God's people
[25:27] and we just we love you Pastor yeah
[25:34] amen let us turn to the Book of Numbers
[25:39] we want to lay really really quick here
[25:42] a foundation of of
[25:45] where that red heifer comes from and
[25:47] brother Milo's going to read
[25:57] and the Lord spake unto Moses and Aaron
[26:00] saying
[26:03] this is the ordinance of the law which
[26:06] the Lord hath commanded
[26:08] thing
[26:10] speak unto the children of Israel that
[26:12] they bring thee a red heifer without
[26:14] spots wherein is no blemish and upon
[26:17] which never came yoke
[26:19] is
[26:35] and ye shall give her unto Eliza the
[26:37] priest
[26:38] that he may bring her forth without the
[26:41] camp and one shall slay her before his
[26:43] face
[26:44] and now he is
[26:54] the priest shall take of her blood with
[26:57] his finger and sprinkle of her blood
[27:00] directly before the Tabernacle of the
[27:02] congregation seven times
[27:15] and one shall burn the heifer in his
[27:18] sight her skin and her flesh and her
[27:21] blood with her dung shall he burn yet
[27:32] and the priest shall take Cedarwood
[27:34] and his up and Scarlet
[27:37] and take it into the midst
[27:40] of the burning of the heifer is
[27:49] then the priest shall wash his clothes
[27:52] and he shall bathe his flesh in water
[27:55] and afterward he shall come into the
[27:57] camp and with the priest shall be
[27:59] unclean until the evening
[28:09] [Music]
[28:11] and hear that burneth her shall wash his
[28:14] clothes in water
[28:15] and bathe his flesh and water and shall
[28:17] be unclean until the evening
[28:26] [Music]
[28:28] and a man that is clean Shall Gather up
[28:30] the ashes of the heifer and lay them up
[28:33] without the camp in a clean place and it
[28:36] shall be kept for the congregation of
[28:37] the children of Israel for a water of
[28:40] Separation it is the purification for
[28:43] sin
[28:46] is
[28:57] an expression
[28:59] amen so as we get into this you know
[29:03] there's there's quite a bit of
[29:06] um symbols here
[29:08] quite a bit of Shadows
[29:12] but before we get into it
[29:16] when this ceremony took place
[29:21] you know at the end of the day what it
[29:24] came what came of it
[29:28] it was called water of Separation
[29:33] to get to our foundation we have to go
[29:36] all the way back to where it came from
[29:41] and even it even started before Moses
[29:47] the ordinance that God gave Moses and
[29:50] Aaron
[29:53] so we gotta go all the way back to
[29:56] Abraham yeah
[30:00] because to me that's where our
[30:02] foundation is here
[30:04] fundamental because God told Abraham
[30:07] separate yourself
[30:12] from the bad stuff
[30:16] you know he wanted him separate from the
[30:19] worldly things
[30:22] and that was it yes so it's easy to
[30:26] separate from that stuff is
[30:29] but God really wanted
[30:33] he wanted to show us something here
[30:38] God told Abram separate yourself
[30:42] this as Believers this is where it hurt
[30:45] Abraham uh
[30:49] separate yourself
[30:52] from your family
[30:54] from your father
[30:58] so it we start here and if there's
[31:02] anything that I've realized through
[31:04] these Waters of Separation
[31:10] how we take for granted
[31:16] the blood that Jesus
[31:20] because you go and you we dig into what
[31:24] this red hat for the meaning of it
[31:26] really is
[31:31] it's something that's so real to them
[31:35] that God came with the law
[31:38] and in those those times if they didn't
[31:41] abide by the laws
[31:44] it was death so now you take the other
[31:48] part of it
[31:50] now they knew they were God's people
[31:53] so they believed in something
[31:56] they believed in what God had placed
[31:59] there for them
[32:02] now we come many years later
[32:08] and many times it's easy to be laxed and
[32:11] this is
[32:13] [Music]
[32:14] and we take God's blood for granted
[32:19] because you we go into history how how
[32:22] many
[32:23] of these ceremonies took place Brothers
[32:29] in the history of the all the history of
[32:31] the Jews it has been performed nine
[32:33] times
[32:37] foreign
[33:19] now the Lord had said unto Abram
[33:21] get thee out of thy country and from thy
[33:24] kindred
[33:24] and from thy Father's House unto the
[33:26] lamb that I will show thee
[33:29] and I will make thee of a great nation
[33:31] and I will bless thee thou make thy name
[33:34] great
[33:35] and thou shalt be a blessing
[33:38] is
[33:48] sorry Genesis 12 1-5
[33:53] foreign
[33:58] and I will bless them that bless thee
[34:00] and I will curse him that cursed thee
[34:02] and in thee shall all families of the
[34:04] earth be blessed
[34:06] is
[34:17] so Abraham departed as the Lord had
[34:19] spoken unto him and lot went with him
[34:22] and Abram was 70 and 5 years old when he
[34:25] departed out of Iran
[34:27] foreign
[34:40] and all their substance that they had
[34:43] together and the souls that they had
[34:45] gotten in Iran
[34:47] and they went forth to go into the land
[34:49] of Canaan and into the land of Canaan
[34:51] they came
[34:53] so
[35:07] so here here is the beginning God gave
[35:10] him the environment
[35:12] and then here he talks about the promise
[35:17] but did Abraham do what God asked
[35:23] no he didn't no no Senor
[35:26] his nephew and he took off to his father
[35:31] see when God comes he calls for a total
[35:35] separation
[35:38] and many times it's a separation even
[35:41] from your own self
[35:44] he said a complete separation
[35:48] from your country and from yours
[35:52] from your family's house
[35:55] God calls for that total separation
[36:00] how many how many could find ourselves
[36:02] there today
[36:04] Matthew 10 36.
[36:10] just so you could see what how his
[36:13] complete word comes comes into place
[36:17] and the man's foe shall be they of his
[36:22] own house
[36:28] more than me is not worthy of me know
[36:32] his dignity me and he that loveth his
[36:35] son or daughter
[36:37] more than me is not worthy of noise and
[36:41] he that taketh not his cross
[36:44] and follow with me
[36:48] is not worthy of Me no dignity so you
[36:52] could see how you know it's easy to say
[36:55] it's passing the city but God's
[36:57] blessings come on
[36:59] he calls for a total separation
[37:03] so now that now that we now that we got
[37:07] the foundation here
[37:09] fundamental now we we could truly get
[37:11] into the Waters of Separation
[37:15] because time we don't have a lot of time
[37:18] here church so
[37:21] when was the heifer first mentioned
[37:27] first with Abraham
[37:30] because the ordinance is that he that
[37:32] started they started first with Abraham
[37:34] says
[37:37] then they transitioned
[37:41] and that's where we find the ordinance
[37:43] today
[37:45] does God had already told Abraham
[37:48] you got to take the heifer
[37:51] you got to take the round
[37:54] you got to take the pigeons
[37:59] so it had already started
[38:02] so Moses had already knewed these
[38:05] ordinances
[38:08] but God says now it's time to get
[38:10] serious
[38:13] you saw how I expected a separation from
[38:16] Abrams
[38:19] now it comes with you
[38:23] total separation
[38:28] so we have here most
[38:31] yes heifer is a Baka and I'm gonna ask
[38:35] brother Milo here he heard Danny really
[38:38] understands really understand the
[38:41] criticalness of of breeding animals
[38:48] and what God really expects is
[38:53] you mind sharing with them what what the
[38:56] expectations of the or the
[38:58] qualifications of this ever happened
[39:04] yeah so this red heifer it's not just an
[39:07] ordinary cow is
[39:12] qualifications that it has to be
[39:15] qualifications
[39:17] were to be used for the ceremony
[39:20] a few that I have found
[39:23] foreign
[39:59] any work done with the
[40:03] um
[40:05] disqualifies it
[40:08] in this case includes even a person
[40:10] leaning on it
[40:13] or placing a garment or cloth upon it
[40:17] [Music]
[40:20] unless this was done to safeguard the
[40:23] animal itself
[40:27] placing a yoke
[40:29] when you work
[40:32] as we see Christ he was this this heifer
[40:35] is typing Christ
[40:39] was never yoked up with the Sadducees
[40:42] and the Pharisees
[40:47] if the heifer is pregnant or even a male
[40:50] mated with it has disqualified it is
[40:57] so we see how how
[41:01] rare it is to find one of these red
[41:03] heifers
[41:10] brother Isaac was the last time
[41:13] that the red that there was a red effort
[41:18] over 2000 years ago
[41:23] Milo said it had to be totally red I
[41:26] mean
[41:26] red
[41:28] um
[41:31] red red heifer red hoofs red nose red
[41:34] eyes
[41:38] two thousand years there there has not
[41:41] been a perfect one down yes yes perfecta
[41:46] the most tremendous part about this is
[41:50] not that they haven't found one
[41:54] is that God's in full control is
[41:59] what he's doing
[42:01] all the way till man tries to take it in
[42:04] his own hands
[42:07] and begins to try to mix it
[42:13] that's why when we get into this next
[42:16] part
[42:18] they see how critical God's law is
[42:23] he wants to make sure we abide by it is
[42:29] through his laws
[42:34] you know because the scripture told us
[42:38] exactly what what he has here
[42:43] but we wanted to get into the Jewish
[42:45] laws see what those exact requirements
[42:48] are yeah
[42:51] to make sure it matched up with verse
[42:54] two that we read
[42:58] because it wasn't just no spots
[43:04] but he said I don't want even a yoke to
[43:08] be honest
[43:10] animal why because this Shadow
[43:14] it was shadowing something
[43:17] it was shadowing the real thing that was
[43:20] to come
[43:23] we know that Christ is
[43:29] there was no yoke on him
[43:33] what it did what what God didn't want to
[43:36] happen
[43:37] was the symbol of that joke upon that
[43:41] cow a symbol of the Legos the Yoke of
[43:44] denominations like if you go to the
[43:47] denominational the Yoke of sin
[43:49] the Yoke of unbelief
[43:53] painted that picture clear for us
[43:57] he says those total separation
[44:01] because we're going to get to the ashes
[44:03] next and this is
[44:05] what makes up those ashes
[44:10] let us let us read before we go so just
[44:13] so that we have a good foundation
[44:17] this was a thinking man's filter is
[44:24] and it gives it's it's going to give the
[44:26] start to finish
[44:30] but it Paints the picture perfectly for
[44:34] us
[44:38] notice in Exodus 19
[44:42] 79 I want to to read it when you go home
[44:48] when you have more time
[44:51] notice when Israel had committed sin
[44:54] observances
[44:56] first they took a red heifer
[45:00] which had never had a yoke on her neck
[45:05] this means she was never
[45:07] was yoke up with anything
[45:12] and she had to be read
[45:14] the color red color is an atonement
[45:18] color
[45:20] you know science knows that if you look
[45:24] if you take red through red
[45:26] is Blanco
[45:32] look through red at Red Rojo it's white
[45:36] it's black he looks through the red
[45:38] blood of the Lord Jesus
[45:42] and our red sins become as white as snow
[45:46] investors
[45:54] and the heifer was killed in the evening
[45:55] time
[45:58] [Music]
[45:59] by the whole Congregation of Israel
[46:03] and there was put
[46:06] seven Stripes of her blood upon the door
[46:08] foreign
[46:20] this is the type of the seven Church
[46:22] ages by the blood is
[46:27] and then her body was taken and burnt
[46:32] it was burnt with the hoof
[46:46] everything was burned together
[46:50] and it had to be picked up by a clean
[46:53] man Olympia
[46:58] and it had to be put in a clean place
[47:02] outside the congregation
[47:05] therefore if Israel could only see the
[47:08] type is
[47:11] this word of God is
[47:14] must not be handled by dirty hands of
[47:17] unbelief
[47:24] that is
[47:25] not even imagine
[47:29] just as a minister to read this
[47:33] you see how critical it is when we come
[47:37] is
[47:40] handle God's word
[47:43] because the law required
[47:46] it to be completely clean is
[47:50] that it had no blemish
[47:54] when your hands touched it
[47:58] ceremony
[48:04] and if he's clean
[48:06] is it Olympia he had to come through
[48:08] God's filter
[48:11] a clean man
[48:13] Clean Hands and had to be kept in a
[48:17] clean place
[48:19] not a place where Jezebels
[48:24] and Ricky's those Ricky's and everything
[48:26] partaking
[48:28] take the communion and things
[48:31] when they're running around with wives
[48:37] and husbands esposos in all kinds of
[48:40] fields
[48:41] going to dances
[48:44] and parties fiestas and wearing bob hair
[48:51] shorts
[48:56] and everything else call themselves
[48:59] Christians
[49:01] it's to be kept in a clean place
[49:09] and
[49:12] recognized that they had done wrong
[49:16] then they were sprinkled
[49:19] with the ashes of this heifer upon them
[49:25] and that was the water of Separation
[49:29] a purification for sin una purification
[49:33] notice here it is
[49:35] and when Israel before they could come
[49:37] into Fellowship Israel
[49:41] in the worship
[49:43] they had to first pass to the Waters of
[49:46] Separation
[49:50] justification by faith
[49:53] commit by hearing
[49:58] then they entered into the congregation
[50:02] under those seven Stripes
[50:06] to show that something died and went
[50:09] before them
[50:13] for their sins
[50:15] they were separated by hearing the word
[50:19] the Waters of Separation
[50:22] then entered into Fellowship
[50:26] the only place that God met a man
[50:49] and God only meets you today in one
[50:52] place
[50:56] and that's in Jesus Christ Jesus Christ
[50:58] he is the word Elizabeth and the Waters
[51:02] of separation
[51:03] and his blood was shed for all seven
[51:06] Church ages
[51:11] and then by the Holy Spirit
[51:14] we enter into that Fellowship
[51:17] which is only given to the church
[51:21] oh how great he is
[51:24] can you give one to the Lord
[51:27] oh my God God's word doesn't
[51:30] [Applause]
[51:38] that we got to come through the washing
[51:41] of the Water by the word
[51:45] there's a reason why one of my favorite
[51:48] scriptures is
[51:51] and he says I heard by the hearing
[51:54] hearing of myself
[51:56] but now my eyes
[51:59] you know because that's where Revelation
[52:02] comes for yeah
[52:04] first we got to be purged we gotta be
[52:07] clean
[52:09] olympiados so before they even burned
[52:13] this red heifer
[52:15] is
[52:16] there's a couple of things that happened
[52:21] when they kill the red heifers
[52:23] the scripture verse 3 tells
[52:27] user the priest
[52:30] he dipped his finger in that blood
[52:35] and he sprinkled it
[52:38] seven times
[52:42] before the temple or before the
[52:44] Tabernacles
[52:47] or before the congregation
[52:50] that's why the prophet of God says
[52:52] that's why when they would enter
[52:55] they saw that something died
[53:11] which was the seven seven Church ages
[53:22] towards the Tabernacle and did the seven
[53:25] times signifying seven dispensations for
[53:27] the seven years
[53:29] that that the church would be sprinkled
[53:32] by the blood
[53:35] upon that heifer
[53:39] and also in another place uh brother
[53:41] Branham says
[53:43] seven times showing that it was a public
[53:47] testimony
[53:51] before the people that an innocent
[53:53] substitute had died for a guilty victim
[54:02] a a public testimony
[54:05] a public testimony to everyone who
[54:08] passed that way
[54:12] know that they were coming under the
[54:15] blood of an innocent substitute of their
[54:18] sins
[54:21] and as brother brother Ben was saying
[54:23] for it was the water of Separation
[54:25] purification
[54:31] and that that's what the Jews have have
[54:33] as we've been saying have been waiting
[54:34] for all this time
[54:42] Why seven times
[54:46] because there was sin in every age
[54:52] seven times the blood was sprinkled
[54:56] making an atonement standing in the
[54:59] state of judgment seven times
[55:04] there the heifer was put into the fire
[55:06] and was burned up to ashes
[55:10] and it it had to be the the Scarlet
[55:15] hyssop is
[55:20] put together
[55:22] and and burnt which meant the
[55:24] dispositions of Grace
[55:28] justification sanctification baptism of
[55:31] the Holy Spirit
[55:32] through Cedarwood hyssop and Scarlet and
[55:36] all was burnt together
[55:41] and many many say oh if you if you just
[55:43] touch the dead body then this had to you
[55:45] you had to go through this this process
[55:51] I like what the prophet how he puts it
[55:54] here
[55:56] he says as any man had did wrong
[56:01] or anything
[56:04] these ashes is the senesis of his heifer
[56:07] was placed upon him and he was separated
[56:09] from his guilt
[56:11] yes
[56:13] it was it was a separation
[56:17] because an animal could not take away
[56:20] the sin
[56:22] it was a covering or a separation
[56:28] many many uh say this was was a it's a
[56:32] ritual ritual gun
[56:35] um again I like the way the thank God
[56:38] for a prophet amen
[56:39] [Music]
[56:40] he says here separation and Memorial
[56:46] through all their generations to know
[56:48] that his heifer a selected heiferous
[56:58] in the blood stood between him and the
[57:02] church
[57:04] ashes it made a separation between him
[57:07] and his guilt
[57:10] and when when when when you see that in
[57:13] place
[57:16] and you place it on Christ Jesus Jesus
[57:21] how that when we do guilt
[57:26] we look at the separation
[57:29] and he who stood at the Judgment there
[57:31] yeah
[57:33] and his blood was dipped from his body
[57:36] and sprinkled across the Earth
[57:42] between that and God's holy Tabernacle
[57:46] introduces
[57:50] that listen here that every believer
[57:54] coming into his presence
[57:57] breaking through the veil of Flesh
[58:03] or in a way the things of the world
[58:07] knows that the blood makes an atonement
[58:12] the Waters of Separation
[58:15] as brother Ben was saying the by the
[58:18] washing of the Water by the word
[58:21] I mean
[58:24] a consecrated life
[58:28] walking in this present world without
[58:31] condemnation
[58:34] and we all know the scripture foreign
[58:52] [Music]
[58:55] as anointed them by the Holy Ghost
[59:00] it
[59:02] I remember brother Ben as a young man he
[59:03] would always say it's got to get
[59:04] personal
[59:07] um
[59:10] leave it back in history and said it was
[59:12] the congregation
[59:13] is
[59:16] but it was sprinkled upon the
[59:19] individuals
[59:22] and he walks in the present world free
[59:25] from condemnation
[59:29] by the Holy Spirit foreign
[59:46] brought out in the presence of all the
[59:48] being
[59:53] out of the presence of Eliza the high
[59:55] priest
[59:58] that was the significance of the seven
[1:00:01] times
[1:00:06] thank you brother Isaac can you imagine
[1:00:07] Isaiah 1 18 just just too tired
[1:00:15] and come now
[1:00:17] and let us reason together saith the
[1:00:19] Lord
[1:00:21] though your sins be as Scarlet they
[1:00:23] shall be white as snow
[1:00:25] though they be read like Crimson they
[1:00:27] shall be as wool
[1:00:30] okay
[1:00:41] so now now we now we can get a little
[1:00:44] further here
[1:00:47] you know brother Isaac did a wonderful
[1:00:49] wonderful job
[1:00:53] seven Stripes
[1:01:00] it's a very rare animals
[1:01:05] red Roja
[1:01:10] red meat Roja but when they burned it
[1:01:14] together
[1:01:16] what color did the ashes come to yeah
[1:01:29] red to Red Rojo comes y here
[1:01:34] God is is rich in his word
[1:01:38] so now they come you know we read the
[1:01:42] scripture already
[1:01:47] part of that animal
[1:01:49] even to the waste of it
[1:01:53] burn it completely
[1:01:56] the Bible says there's three things that
[1:01:59] got mixed in that fire that's what we're
[1:02:02] going to cover right now
[1:02:05] um
[1:02:09] Cedarwood yeah
[1:02:14] this is powerful it says
[1:02:19] Amen brother Ben before we get into the
[1:02:22] cedar wood
[1:02:24] this would like for us all to realize
[1:02:29] how important this is
[1:02:33] this is not something that this it's for
[1:02:36] history
[1:02:38] it's like what brother Ben used to say
[1:02:40] we got to get personal tonight
[1:02:45] you have to bring it what good would it
[1:02:47] be for this red heifer to read about it
[1:02:50] to learn about it back in history
[1:02:57] why do you guys keep on saying I used to
[1:03:00] say yeah
[1:03:02] [Laughter]
[1:03:05] all right and so
[1:03:08] what good would it do for me
[1:03:10] if I left it there in the Bible
[1:03:13] but if this Bible doesn't come alive
[1:03:17] and it doesn't do something for me right
[1:03:20] now
[1:03:21] it doesn't do anything for you right now
[1:03:24] where you're sitting
[1:03:27] and what are we doing here
[1:03:30] just warming a bench
[1:03:33] I'm talking to myself here
[1:03:37] put it on
[1:03:39] [Music]
[1:03:40] but the Bible says
[1:03:43] though your sins be read as Crimson
[1:03:47] um
[1:03:49] they should be white as snow okay
[1:03:52] God looking through the blood
[1:03:56] don't see you as a sinner
[1:04:00] he sees us redeemed
[1:04:03] and why we are redeemed
[1:04:07] because he sees us through Christ
[1:04:10] that's the reason we could be made
[1:04:12] perfect
[1:04:15] not in the sense that we are sinless
[1:04:19] [Music]
[1:04:20] but perfect in the eyes of God
[1:04:24] because we are in Christ
[1:04:27] that's the reason he said
[1:04:30] be perfect even as my Father in Heaven
[1:04:33] is perfect perfect
[1:04:37] we see Paul in the 10th chapter of
[1:04:39] Hebrews
[1:04:42] he's trying to explain the law having a
[1:04:45] shadow of good things to come is
[1:04:47] [Music]
[1:04:50] not the very image of things
[1:04:54] could make the comma perfect
[1:04:57] could make the comer the worshiper
[1:04:59] because
[1:05:03] God was looking at that time he was
[1:05:05] looking through the blood of an animal
[1:05:10] but now he looks through the blood of
[1:05:13] his own son
[1:05:16] we see that Perfection comes through
[1:05:18] Jesus Christ
[1:05:20] the blood of an animal could never take
[1:05:23] sin away
[1:05:28] but the blood of Jesus
[1:05:31] completely removes Sin from the
[1:05:33] worshipers
[1:05:38] so what you're saying is is
[1:05:41] when they did this ordinance
[1:05:46] they still left the same desire foreign
[1:05:54] now
[1:06:13] Cedarwood is a very tremendous type of
[1:06:15] wood
[1:06:18] it is first of all one of the toughest
[1:06:20] Woods is
[1:06:23] out there yeah yeah it is resistant
[1:06:26] to disease
[1:06:33] it is well known for its quality and
[1:06:36] preciousness
[1:06:42] does anyone know why it's so precious
[1:06:46] it's a white word with red streaks
[1:06:52] which speaks of the righteousness of the
[1:06:54] Cross
[1:06:57] and the red streaks
[1:07:00] speak of the blood that make it
[1:07:03] righteous
[1:07:06] all right man
[1:07:11] the cedar tree grows tall
[1:07:16] imposing of the white symbolizing if he
[1:07:19] can say that again imposing with a wide
[1:07:26] blancho symbolizing adines
[1:07:32] artiness
[1:07:38] this word was used to build the house of
[1:07:41] King David it's the it's the fusalem
[1:07:45] as well for the temple that Solomon
[1:07:48] built
[1:07:50] we see how precious this wood is right
[1:07:58] the next
[1:08:00] material I was put into it was scarletta
[1:08:06] Scarlett was sheep's wool died in Blood
[1:08:08] and
[1:08:14] to be there in Sangre
[1:08:18] he was bleeding
[1:08:20] that was the Scarlet that was put into
[1:08:22] the waters
[1:08:24] so Redemption comes through the blood
[1:08:30] all the way from Genesis to Revelation
[1:08:32] there's a Genesis
[1:08:35] there's a red streak of redemption
[1:08:42] let's take Rahab the Harlot
[1:08:47] brother Branham says
[1:08:50] that rahab's house stood on the walls of
[1:08:53] Jericho when
[1:09:01] all the rest of it
[1:09:03] because there was a scarlet cord
[1:09:09] um
[1:09:11] hanging outside
[1:09:13] let's take the children of Israel
[1:09:16] brother Ben um
[1:09:21] the children of each of Israel in Egypt
[1:09:23] and a hippo
[1:09:25] oh it was commanded that the eldest son
[1:09:27] be killed
[1:09:32] but brother Isaac what did they do yes
[1:09:36] that they would be saved
[1:09:42] it's because there was blood on the
[1:09:45] lintel the doorpost is
[1:09:49] the death angel to pass
[1:09:55] do we see how important this is
[1:09:58] how many of us parents have placed that
[1:10:01] blood on the doorpost of our lentils
[1:10:05] [Music]
[1:10:08] and brother Isaac's going to talk to us
[1:10:10] a little bit
[1:10:11] about the third one
[1:10:16] which is
[1:10:22] now
[1:10:24] for the brand brother Brandon
[1:10:26] I'll just hit the highlights here to
[1:10:28] save time
[1:10:32] he's saying it uh it was a just a common
[1:10:35] weed that grew in the Middle East
[1:10:38] is
[1:10:44] and that it even grows out out of the
[1:10:47] cracks of the walls there is
[1:10:53] then he says
[1:10:55] what do they speak of
[1:10:57] what did it speak of
[1:11:00] faith
[1:11:02] faith
[1:11:04] it's a faith just common faith
[1:11:07] come on
[1:11:09] and he says you think you have to have
[1:11:11] to have some Supernatural Faith to get
[1:11:13] something from God
[1:11:17] just common Faith come on you you've
[1:11:22] just got to apply the blood
[1:11:25] if you're sitting here now
[1:11:29] and you never met Jesus in your in your
[1:11:31] life
[1:11:33] just apply that simple faith that
[1:11:36] brought you to this building
[1:11:39] you don't got to go to a theology school
[1:11:44] learn some great long Creeds
[1:11:49] the only thing you have to know
[1:11:53] is that Jesus died to save Sinners Jesus
[1:11:59] and his blood washes you white as snow
[1:12:02] is
[1:12:04] and he says that is simple childlike
[1:12:09] faith is
[1:12:12] so if you're sick tonight
[1:12:16] apply that simple common Faith oblique
[1:12:20] is uh
[1:12:22] so so hyssop was it it's it's a part of
[1:12:27] the uh the mint family
[1:12:28] is
[1:12:31] I I have a couple pictures of the hyssop
[1:12:34] if they want to want to put them up
[1:12:40] and it the Greek word uh is his full his
[1:12:44] his sopos
[1:12:47] and and the Hebrew word azob
[1:12:50] the delivery was up meaning holy herb
[1:12:54] the significant
[1:12:56] and it was used in ancient times as a
[1:12:59] cleansing herb for temples and other
[1:13:01] sacred places
[1:13:04] in symbolic form and it represents
[1:13:07] humility repentance
[1:13:12] and sacrifice sacrificio
[1:13:16] the cleansing effect in connection with
[1:13:20] with the with plagues
[1:13:29] chest ailments
[1:13:37] and a simple form of in cleansing of the
[1:13:41] cleansing the soul you know simple
[1:13:43] formal Olympia
[1:13:45] and and as brother Branham it says here
[1:13:48] the the cedar the hyssop all that that
[1:13:50] was burned with with the heifer
[1:13:53] is on
[1:13:57] yeah
[1:14:00] it spoke of Christ on the cross
[1:14:03] as brother Ben was saying it it was it
[1:14:05] was the same same Bush it was applied uh
[1:14:09] on on the door lentils replica
[1:14:13] meaning Christ himself the the Cedar and
[1:14:17] the history
[1:14:19] Christ is inseparable
[1:14:22] you can separate the cross
[1:14:25] and different things
[1:14:27] and mean this that or the other is
[1:14:31] but
[1:14:33] Christo you cannot separate
[1:14:37] the whole bush has to be there
[1:14:40] he says it was the same Bush that was
[1:14:43] that grew along the the Jordan River so
[1:14:45] foreign
[1:14:52] worry
[1:14:54] all right
[1:14:57] sorry
[1:15:01] one one of the one of the important ones
[1:15:03] that got me was important you don't have
[1:15:07] to turn I'll just refer to it
[1:15:12] it's John 19 29.
[1:15:17] this is this is Jesus on the cross
[1:15:21] now there was said a vessels full of
[1:15:23] vinegar
[1:15:25] and they filled a sponge with vinegar
[1:15:27] and put it upon hyssop and put it to his
[1:15:31] mouth
[1:15:33] is
[1:15:44] thank you all for that so you see how
[1:15:47] God knew what he was doing when he
[1:15:49] described these three elements
[1:15:56] so now we have God put a law into action
[1:16:03] did you know that that law is still in
[1:16:05] effect today
[1:16:07] we don't realize
[1:16:10] but every time you wash your hands
[1:16:14] it is still in effect today
[1:16:17] because one of one of the mo one of the
[1:16:21] strongest purifications
[1:16:24] but foreign
[1:17:38] sprinkle it for the sins of the people
[1:17:43] but brother Abraham where did they get
[1:17:46] the water from
[1:17:48] the pool of him
[1:17:53] so that God wanted it to be so clean yes
[1:18:01] God wanted this so clean yes
[1:18:08] on the back of not a cow you know
[1:18:12] but now the male part
[1:18:15] on the back of a bull
[1:18:18] because God says he has to be clean
[1:18:22] yes feet touch the ground
[1:18:28] he will no longer be clean yeah he wrote
[1:18:32] on the bull all the way to Siloam
[1:18:36] to get that water
[1:18:38] that was moved once once a year
[1:18:42] when the Holy Spirit came from
[1:18:46] but what
[1:18:48] fed into silence
[1:18:55] the stream of the home
[1:18:59] it was one of the streams that came from
[1:19:01] where Brother Carlos
[1:19:03] is
[1:19:08] so I have one question tonight
[1:19:11] through their Traditions
[1:19:14] they took the
[1:19:17] these ashes from the previous heifers
[1:19:24] and they mix them together
[1:19:27] with the new ceremony
[1:19:30] but as we heard in some of the panels
[1:19:35] with highness
[1:19:41] all the ashes from the heifer were gone
[1:19:44] and and done away with dollars
[1:19:50] so even if they find a heifer
[1:19:54] where are they going to get the ashes
[1:19:56] from the previous heifers
[1:20:03] simple essential
[1:20:06] God is just going to have to call the
[1:20:08] same one
[1:20:10] ceremonial that he gave these ordinances
[1:20:20] well with
[1:20:22] with Carlos Hill's permission
[1:20:27] he doesn't have a man after on this
[1:20:29] little yeah
[1:20:34] enough for a reason yeah
[1:20:39] okay
[1:20:44] so we got a foundation fundamento
[1:20:49] we find that Abraham started the
[1:20:51] separation
[1:20:54] and he searched for a city
[1:21:00] and the place that he searched foreign
[1:21:29] and Moses took the Tabernacle and
[1:21:31] pitched it without the camp a far off
[1:21:33] from the camp and called it the
[1:21:36] Tabernacle of the congregation
[1:21:38] and it came to pass that everyone which
[1:21:40] sought the Lord went out of the
[1:21:42] Tabernacle of the congregation
[1:21:44] which was without the camp
[1:21:46] Exodus 40
[1:21:48] verse 1 and 2.
[1:21:52] 0 foreign
[1:22:05] and the Lord spake unto Moses saying on
[1:22:09] the first day of the first month thou
[1:22:11] shall set up the Tabernacle of the tent
[1:22:13] of the congregation
[1:22:29] you read verse two yes
[1:22:32] okay people in this message think that
[1:22:36] is
[1:22:39] coming back in a 10th Ministry
[1:22:45] brother Branham wanted a tent
[1:22:49] when he was in his first
[1:22:54] but then
[1:23:34] [Music]
[1:23:53] keeps going around the world foreign
[1:24:00] [Music]
[1:24:39] foreign
[1:24:49] we have such an high priest who has set
[1:24:51] on the right hand of the Throne of the
[1:24:53] Majesty in Heavens
[1:25:04] a minister of the sanctuary
[1:25:07] and of the true Tabernacle which the
[1:25:10] Lord pitched the true Tabernacle yeah
[1:25:18] to me
[1:25:20] Glory
[1:25:26] did you read who he says that God
[1:25:29] preached
[1:25:31] he was supposed to then you pitched the
[1:25:35] tent come on foreign
[1:26:16] remember night is a Jewish Sage
[1:26:23] said when the tenth heifer comes from
[1:26:28] it will introduce the Messiah
[1:26:33] in order to build a little town
[1:26:39] they need a red helper this is
[1:26:46] Moses sacrificed the first one
[1:26:50] and when the white actions were almost
[1:26:53] gone
[1:26:56] they killed another heifer
[1:27:00] mixing the edges of the first heifers
[1:27:05] with the other one
[1:27:08] until they killed the ninth one
[1:27:13] in order to build another Temple
[1:27:17] the entire site has to be purified
[1:27:23] critical
[1:27:24] so they got we just reading the paper
[1:27:28] was
[1:27:30] that they wrote about five heifers red
[1:27:34] heifers from Texas
[1:27:39] so everybody's thinking now the Messiah
[1:27:42] can come this is
[1:27:47] not no matter how perfect those heifers
[1:27:50] they came from Texas
[1:27:54] they cannot use those perfect heifers in
[1:27:58] Israel
[1:28:01] because it has to be a heifer that was
[1:28:05] born in Israel and not in Texas
[1:28:11] hmm
[1:28:15] they have no ashes
[1:28:17] he was destroyed when General Titus
[1:28:21] burned down Jerusalem
[1:28:25] so the question arises
[1:28:32] why couldn't
[1:28:36] or other kind of animals
[1:28:39] the question arises why are they using a
[1:28:44] heifer to make ashes
[1:28:50] red heifers are extremely rare is
[1:28:56] and the water they use for the ceremony
[1:29:01] ceremony well Ben already told us
[1:29:07] follow me here
[1:29:09] and may God give you Revelations
[1:29:13] this is
[1:29:18] now I know that this will kind of choke
[1:29:22] you is
[1:29:24] a little bit
[1:29:27] you don't read the Bible just like this
[1:29:33] he said you read between the lines
[1:29:39] and then you make the picture come
[1:29:45] on
[1:29:53] and when the people saw that Moses
[1:29:55] delayed to come down out of the mount
[1:29:58] the people gather themselves together
[1:30:00] unto Aaron and said unto him up make us
[1:30:05] Gods which shall go before us for as
[1:30:08] this Moses the man that brought us up
[1:30:11] out of the land of Egypt
[1:30:13] we want not what is become of him is
[1:30:26] Conte
[1:30:33] isn't that is happening now and happen
[1:30:36] all the time
[1:30:39] Moses delayed
[1:30:42] the people saying well Jesus has delayed
[1:30:45] his comments
[1:30:53] so they got a big God now like the pope
[1:30:56] Grande
[1:31:00] happened right here
[1:31:05] second Peter 3 verses 3 and 4.
[1:31:13] knowing this verse that there shall come
[1:31:15] the last days scoffers
[1:31:18] walking after their own lusts
[1:31:21] and saying where is the promise of his
[1:31:23] coming
[1:31:24] for since the fathers fell asleep all
[1:31:27] things continue as they were from the
[1:31:29] beginning of Creation in verse 9 also
[1:31:34] the Lord is not slack concerning his
[1:31:37] promise
[1:31:38] as some men count slackness but in
[1:31:42] long-suffering
[1:31:43] to towards usward not willing that any
[1:31:46] should perish
[1:31:48] but that all should come to repentance
[1:31:50] is
[1:31:54] [Music]
[1:32:08] repentance
[1:32:20] so how are they going to rule
[1:32:24] taking all the gold
[1:32:27] so where did that Spirit of the gold
[1:32:30] star
[1:32:33] Exodus 32 2 to 4.
[1:32:39] and Aaron said unto them
[1:32:41] break off the Golden Earrings which are
[1:32:43] in the in the ears of your wives
[1:32:46] of your sons and of your daughters and
[1:32:49] bring them to me
[1:32:58] and and all the people break off their
[1:33:01] Golden Earrings which were in their ears
[1:33:04] and brought them unto Aaron Antonio
[1:33:12] and he received them at their hand and
[1:33:15] fashioned it with a grieving tool after
[1:33:17] he had made it a molten calf
[1:33:20] and they said these be thy Gods o Israel
[1:33:24] which brought thee up out of the land of
[1:33:26] Egypt Israel
[1:33:36] foreign
[1:35:03] on one side
[1:35:06] the double at the Dome of the Rock
[1:35:13] and Domo and on the other side
[1:35:22] so they identify the Temple mount with
[1:35:24] Mount Moriah
[1:35:27] and when the Jews pray they look to this
[1:35:31] place is
[1:35:36] animals sacrifices for burnt offerings
[1:35:43] for only to be offered by the hands of
[1:35:46] the Jewish priesthood
[1:35:50] as they were marching through the desert
[1:35:54] sacred pastors were only allowed in the
[1:35:56] Tabernacles
[1:36:00] after building the first temple this
[1:36:03] first the country
[1:36:05] sacrifices were allowed only in the
[1:36:07] temple in Jerusalem
[1:36:13] and when it was destroyed
[1:36:17] sacrifices resumed in the second temple
[1:36:22] after the destruction of the second
[1:36:24] temple
[1:36:27] sacrifices were prohibited
[1:36:30] sacrifices foreign
[1:37:05] [Music]
[1:37:13] again to pray at the holy side yes
[1:37:19] so Israel officially United East
[1:37:23] Jerusalem Israel
[1:37:29] including the Temple mount with the rest
[1:37:31] of Jerusalem including
[1:37:33] including the mountain in the template
[1:37:37] so under Jerusalem
[1:37:42] but the United Nations Security Council
[1:37:46] is
[1:37:52] declared to be in violation of
[1:37:55] international laws
[1:37:59] and gave it back to Jordan
[1:38:04] to take and follow the Temple Mount but
[1:38:07] a controller Temple El Monte del templo
[1:38:10] in the gospels
[1:38:12] we learned that God will return again to
[1:38:15] the Jews
[1:38:18] well if that be so yes
[1:38:22] how can we apply it back to the times of
[1:38:25] Daniel
[1:38:28] we've got to apply it in this last age
[1:38:34] and it's after the Gentile church has
[1:38:37] been gone he has a special like
[1:38:40] because he deals with Israel as a nation
[1:38:44] and it took 49 years to complete the
[1:38:48] temple in concert
[1:38:50] and they build it in troubles and times
[1:38:55] does that sound familiar yes
[1:40:00] and when they rejected the Messiah
[1:40:04] Daniel 9 27 Daniel Nueva ventis diet
[1:40:11] and and he shall confirm the Covenant
[1:40:14] with many for one week
[1:40:16] and in the midst of the week he shall
[1:40:18] cause the sacrifice and the oblation to
[1:40:21] cease and for the overspreading of
[1:40:23] Abominations he shall make it desolate
[1:40:26] even into the consummation
[1:40:28] and that determined shall be poured upon
[1:40:32] the desolate
[1:40:51] solar
[1:40:52] I always thought
[1:40:56] that
[1:40:58] Elijah and Moses
[1:41:01] were coming in the first three and a
[1:41:04] half years out of the 70 weeks of Daniel
[1:41:07] Kevin
[1:41:13] Jesus preached the first three and a
[1:41:16] half years of the 70th week
[1:41:21] and it says you're at the middle of the
[1:41:24] week he was cut off
[1:41:28] there was when he was crucified
[1:41:31] crucified
[1:41:33] are coming in the last three and a half
[1:41:36] years after seven days
[1:41:42] because it's only for the Jews the 70
[1:41:45] weeks is
[1:41:49] oh how much right
[1:41:51] notice he can say
[1:41:54] When They Crucified him on the crucified
[1:41:56] God is dealing with the Jews he just
[1:41:59] said
[1:42:01] but the time extended just a little
[1:42:04] further yeah
[1:42:07] 40 years more
[1:42:10] later General Tyler's destroyed
[1:42:13] Jerusalem despite externality
[1:42:16] Jerusalem because he took God holy years
[1:42:19] to tear up
[1:42:21] the temple and Scattered the Jews all
[1:42:24] over the world
[1:42:31] of course using general Titus
[1:42:35] God didn't deal with them anymore
[1:43:01] and he shall send his angels with the
[1:43:03] great sound of a trumpet and they shall
[1:43:06] gather together his elect from the Four
[1:43:08] Winds from one end of Heaven to the
[1:43:11] others
[1:43:18] we know that those trumpets is Moses
[1:43:25] to call them back to the atonement
[1:43:31] the Jews rejected the atonement
[1:43:36] so your eyes and mine could be okay
[1:43:42] and during this time the seals open
[1:43:47] and the Trump expl
[1:43:51] also the Jews can come back to their
[1:43:53] homelands
[1:43:57] this extended time is a long period of
[1:44:00] time this is
[1:44:13] it was 50 days
[1:44:17] from the Feast of Pentacles
[1:44:24] for 50 days
[1:44:27] this is seven
[1:44:31] seventh is a seventh churches
[1:44:35] and we know that then at the end the
[1:44:38] Gentile bride is taken away
[1:44:42] and there will be a whipping and wailing
[1:44:46] in the Nationals
[1:44:49] and at the same time foreign
[1:45:01] [Music]
[1:45:27] foreign
[1:46:07] foreign
[1:46:13] [Music]
[1:47:30] because each time that workers will
[1:47:32] start to build condolences
[1:47:35] they were burned by terrible planes
[1:47:38] coming from inside the earth
[1:47:44] an earthquake
[1:47:47] remote then stop the work
[1:47:50] for many years
[1:47:53] the U.S has helped Israel as Thousand
[1:47:56] Years Israel
[1:48:02] but when Obama came into power when
[1:48:06] Obama in throwing povert his
[1:48:08] administration fully supported Iran
[1:48:12] issue Administration compartment
[1:48:14] over Israel Israel and didn't try to
[1:48:19] stop them in the development of nuclear
[1:48:22] weapons
[1:48:26] but president Trump for four years he
[1:48:30] put a stop to the president Trump
[1:48:34] but now those who are in control after
[1:48:38] control have turned the administration
[1:48:41] support back to Iran
[1:48:45] is Iran
[1:48:49] I can stop you you want me I got about
[1:48:52] two people I can continue it's up to you
[1:48:58] it's very important it's more important
[1:49:00] but you know
[1:49:06] they have turned the support back to
[1:49:09] Iran Andreas
[1:49:11] today Israel there's hardly any support
[1:49:14] from anyone our India Israel
[1:49:19] because of their isolation and hatred to
[1:49:23] them
[1:49:27] they more than ever
[1:49:29] the time has come to build the temple
[1:49:35] so that they can sacrifice the Passover
[1:49:38] land
[1:49:43] because they are still under the
[1:49:45] atonement of a natural limb okay after
[1:49:52] after this
[1:50:00] gave use of the Temple mount back to the
[1:50:03] Muslims
[1:50:07] in an attempt to avoid Another War
[1:50:11] the Muslims were given permission to
[1:50:14] operate their facilities
[1:50:24] full control of the area
[1:50:30] when some Muslims threw bricks those
[1:50:33] praying that the Wailing Walls
[1:50:40] is the
[1:50:43] okay
[1:51:10] yeah
[1:51:13] Revelation 11 1. apocalyptians
[1:51:23] and there was giving me a read like unto
[1:51:26] a rod and the angel stood saying rise
[1:51:29] and measure the temple of God and the
[1:51:32] Altar and them that worship therein is
[1:51:43] but the core which is without the temple
[1:51:45] leave out and measure it not for it is
[1:51:49] given unto the Gentiles and the holy
[1:51:51] city shall they tread underfoot
[1:51:55] 40 and two months is
[1:52:08] so who's gonna measure
[1:52:10] I can not ex found on this scripture
[1:52:14] because I don't have the time no
[1:52:15] apologies
[1:52:17] maybe some other time
[1:52:22] he stole the man it was going to measure
[1:52:26] the temple he was
[1:52:29] and remember that easily gave permission
[1:52:35] Israel super mission for the Muslims to
[1:52:38] have their Temple up there
[1:52:40] and if you notice what they just read is
[1:52:48] not only the temples
[1:52:54] worshipers
[1:52:57] oh yes the question
[1:53:00] next time we come
[1:53:03] bring me a measuring tape
[1:53:07] I'm gonna measure all you girls
[1:53:12] because we think that major is getting a
[1:53:15] major intense
[1:53:42] you know I I have to I'm not gonna
[1:53:46] because I would like to expand on that
[1:53:49] but maybe some other time
[1:53:52] and believe me I skipped a few things
