[31:48] it's going to seem at first like a like
[31:51] uh this part doesn't go with it

[31:59] it and and and uh it's all part it's all
[32:03] in the great plan of God
[32:08] Revelation 17 let's start with verse 5.
[32:12] and upon her forehead was was a name
[32:15] written mystery Babylon the Great
[32:18] the mother of harlots and Abominations
[32:21] of the Earth
[32:22] is
[32:29] and I saw the woman drunken with the
[32:33] blood of saints of the Saints and with
[32:36] the blood of the martyrs of Jesus
[32:39] when I saw her I wandered with great
[32:42] admiration
[32:48] Jesus
[32:53] what words we find here
[32:57] John seeing this mystery Babylon Juan
[33:01] bien
[33:02] Babylonia he wondered with great
[33:05] admiration
[33:07] was admiring it is
[33:11] and verse 7 says and the angel said unto
[33:15] me watch the angel catching John's
[33:18] reaction to this
[33:22] wherefore did thou Marvel
[33:27] I will tell thee The Mystery of the
[33:30] woman
[33:33] and of the Beast
[33:35] that carrieth her which half the seven
[33:39] heads
[33:41] and the ten
[33:43] hornsas but we are glad that we have the
[33:47] God sent a prophet
[33:50] the only way we would understand the
[33:53] mystery of the woman
[33:59] amen may God add His blessings to the
[34:01] Ring of his word you may be seated
[34:06] I could actually have named this also
[34:09] Beauty and the Beast
[34:14] but let's go into this if we can try the
[34:18] nest during this during this this trip
[34:20] that me and my wife went on
[34:24] a couple of places that the Lord allowed
[34:27] us to visit
[34:31] was uh Rome and Pompeii where Roma
[34:36] Pompeo and most of you of course all of
[34:39] you know Roman Pompeii are
[34:41] are ruined
[34:44] three ruins left
[34:47] when brother Branham speaks about the
[34:50] about Los Angeles and so forth
[34:53] Los Angeles he says it'll be worse than
[34:56] the last days of Pompeii this is
[35:00] and things that I've always wanted to I
[35:03] guess if you can say on your bucket list
[35:08] I always wanted to go to Rome
[35:11] thankful to the Lord that he permitted
[35:14] us to go to Jerusalem last year
[35:18] now I wanted to go to Rome
[35:21] and when you go into Rome and Pompeii is
[35:26] what a
[35:28] what a filthy
[35:32] low down immoral places that they were
[35:37] you know you you hear about things and
[35:40] you and you you see pictures and you
[35:43] hear stories and escucha kosas
[35:47] all it was in these places
[35:52] it was nothing but pleasure
[35:57] self-gratification
[36:00] entertainment until it got to a place
[36:03] that God said that's enough
[36:08] he brought judgment on them and and and
[36:13] Pompeii Pompeo all it was was just a
[36:17] city of brothels
[36:21] yeah that's right there's nothing but
[36:23] houses
[36:25] you walk the streets and everywhere oh
[36:27] they say oh this was another one now oh
[36:29] this was another one
[36:33] that's all it was was just cities of
[36:36] pleasure
[36:40] but there was a certain day that came
[36:44] when they least expected it when
[36:48] Mount Vesuvius that volcano erupted El
[36:52] Monte Vesuvius is
[36:54] and it destroyed that City
[36:57] many of you maybe have seen the movie or
[37:00] or have read about it
[37:04] we saw a a woman that was that had that
[37:09] the lava had gotten to her
[37:12] when they when they when they dug and
[37:14] they found this woman she she was like
[37:16] this with her with her arm over her face
[37:23] trying to cover her eyes
[37:27] but she could not outrun the judgments
[37:29] of God
[37:31] they never thought that the wrath of God
[37:35] God's judgments would ever get to them
[37:40] we live in a world today that is exactly
[37:45] like that
[37:48] we think we can live any kind of life
[37:51] and and that the judgments of God are
[37:53] not going to get to us
[37:57] I want to say today that is the LIE of
[38:00] the devil is
[38:02] it will catch up to you one day
[38:06] if you cannot accept his grace and mercy
[38:09] that he's offering today
[38:15] these places had created such an economy
[38:20] that they came to a place that they
[38:22] thought they didn't need God anymore
[38:25] they could do it on their own
[38:43] and there that great city has now become
[38:47] nothing
[38:50] but you'd have to dig 30 feet under the
[38:53] Earth to find the ruins of it
[39:00] and now one of the weakest
[39:04] most degraded nations in the world
[39:08] he said they're not even self-supporting
[39:13] my student Athens Greece in Athens
[39:17] another Empire once stood
[39:22] Imperial and there's not hardly a symbol
[39:25] of that Empire left
[39:29] I stood in Cairo Egypt
[39:32] which was which once ruled the world in
[39:35] the days of the Pharaohs
[39:40] and there's nothing left but a sphinx
[39:43] and a few pyramids
[39:46] and brother and sister he says
[39:50] hate America
[39:52] the Grand America and our great economy
[39:57] that we have yet is rot rotting under
[40:01] the foundations
[40:04] and someday I see it in the making right
[40:08] now
[40:10] we'll lay in Ruins
[40:13] and you young men today you said this
[40:16] whole you young women
[40:18] with the beauty of Youth
[40:22] the blush of the young cheek Rocio in
[40:25] ensues the Folly of the young heart
[40:30] but one day we'll wander in a graveyard
[40:34] somewhere
[40:38] because all Mortals have to give way to
[40:42] immortality
[40:45] he says every nation has to fall
[40:49] because they're there's coming a nation
[41:04] God is always warning and he always
[41:07] sends warning judgment
[41:12] he gives us an opportunity to repent
[41:17] and many times we turn our backs on him
[41:23] how many opportunities how many more
[41:25] opportunities do
[41:28] how many more opportunities will we will
[41:32] ask you that question
[41:35] because I believe that God is doing
[41:40] because in all reality the
[41:43] teeth trash that
[41:45] that gets accredited over the years
[41:50] and I believe that he's he's clearing
[41:53] the trash out
[41:56] how many believe that it's for us to
[41:59] check our lives
[42:05] and then we try to serve God and we just
[42:08] can't seem to get anywhere
[42:12] too much much accumulation of trash
[42:18] want to know maybe at times these
[42:21] messages might get a little hard
[42:22] obviously
[42:24] I'm not attacking one
[42:27] Persona I'm not against a person I'm
[42:29] against Spirits
[42:33] he's just he he's aiming it at you
[42:38] can't believe him if you want
[42:41] but I'm I'm after your well-being
[42:46] I'm after making it home
[42:50] now while we were in Rome I I we were
[42:53] able to visit the Vatican yes
[42:57] and while there this is the scripture
[43:00] that came to me
[43:02] of Revelation 17 the apocalypse is this
[43:06] is yes and John marveled
[43:09] when you walk through the vatic and I if
[43:12] there's anyone here that's ever been
[43:13] there you
[43:22] and and as we were as I was as I was as
[43:26] I was pondering this scripture
[43:29] I could hear the angels say why did you
[43:32] Marvel if uh police
[43:36] I'll tell you the mystery of the woman
[43:39] and the Beast
[43:43] walking down the hallways and I wish I
[43:46] would I should have had some pictures
[43:48] for you just to see him
[43:51] but walking around down those hallways
[43:55] all the paintings and the and the
[43:58] sculptures of marble Las pinturas
[44:01] tapestries the gold the Grandeur of it
[44:05] all
[44:08] I felt much like John
[44:12] Juan all you can do is Marvel wow
[44:17] and and the more we would look and we'd
[44:19] see those things
[44:23] you can see how Constantine he brought
[44:26] the heathens and the and the Christians
[44:28] together
[44:33] into this room

[47:17] NOS is
[47:21] the confusion in the churches
[47:25] yes Zechariah if you can open your

[47:55] follow this this for a moment
[47:58] then he answered and spoken to me saying
[48:01] this is the word of the Lord unto
[48:03] zerubbabel
[48:05] say not by might nor by power but by my
[48:09] spirit saith the Lord of hosts
[48:22] who are
[48:24] Downton before
[48:28] the Rel shall become a plane
[48:32] and he shall bring forth the head
[48:39] thereof with shoutings crying Grace
[48:42] Grace to it
[48:47] this all goes with Babylon okay
[48:51] I asked my family the question last
[48:54] night
[48:55] so I want to ask you
[48:59] what was the commission to zerubbabel
[49:05] anybody can answer
[49:08] what was this Commission
[49:17] he's close but okay
[49:25] yeah that's right right to restore or
[49:27] rebuild the Temple
[49:29] everybody in agreement okay zoruba Bell
[49:33] then
[49:34] was to restore or build the temple a
[49:39] restaurant under the message of Grace
[49:42] the types right that's why we read that
[49:46] we read that quote that said it's all
[49:49] through all the types of the Bible show
[49:52] it
[49:58] was the prince with who
[50:03] with Joshua not right not the Joshua
[50:06] that was with Moses
[50:09] with Joshua the high priest at that time
[50:13] yes

[50:33] shown in types is
[50:42] okay well you're you're right there yes
[50:46] that's right you're close but but let's
[50:49] fine tune it a little bit more yeah
[50:58] because Joshua the high priest is the
[51:01] type of our high priest right
[51:03] Jesus Christ is our high priest
[51:07] but there's a prince that goes
[51:11] with that with Joshua the high priest
[51:21] let's go back because the rubber bout
[51:24] was commissioned to restore or rebuild
[51:27] the temples
[51:30] oh let's let's bring it closer to home
[51:33] now
[51:34] the rubber Bell is a type of
[51:43] the rubber Bell is a type of
[51:46] we're not getting nowhere
[51:50] okay somebody finally zerubbabel is a
[51:54] type of the seventh Angels
[51:57] he's a type of the seventh angel
[52:00] messenger
[52:02] because he's the one that has and
[52:05] brought them
[52:08] that was to restore the temple
[52:12] right and you are the Temple of the Holy
[52:15] Ghost
[52:16] and it was to be under the message of
[52:19] Grace
[52:21] now now he was to rebuild the church
[52:25] again
[52:27] and we understand that Paul was the wise
[52:31] master builder
[52:34] the foundation he said and another bill
[52:38] is the pawn
[52:39] but they were it was to rebuild the
[52:42] church on
[52:43] English
[52:56] sometimes we sing songs in church and we
[52:59] don't even know what they mean
[53:01] but now you can sing it and know what it
[53:04] means
[53:05] yes
[53:12] okay now you can sing with Revelation
[53:16] and when you sing with Revelation
[53:19] honors and it comes down and He blesses
[53:23] his people the problem is is that we
[53:26] just sing
[53:28] sitting there with a base and I'm
[53:30] watching you
[53:33] this is
[53:34] [Music]
[53:37] and I'm like wow they're they're excited
[53:43] you can't even hear nothing why are you
[53:45] even clapping right
[53:51] you know who you are how guilty you are
[53:54] I'm trying to help you here because we
[53:58] don't come to church to worship
[54:01] to soothe our conscience that well we're
[54:03] here
[54:08] probably over half of the church don't
[54:10] even sing
[54:13] and I'm watching everything
[54:18] watching everybody else
[54:23] they don't even care if they sing
[54:25] they're not here to worship
[54:34] with this Holy Spirit
[54:40] and then some of you ain't nothing
[54:41] coming out
[54:44] when are they going to finish
[54:47] [Music]
[54:49] and that's the church yes no wonder he
[54:53] had to pull a bride out of the church
[54:57] he was to build this church and restore
[55:01] it
[55:02] under the power of the Holy Ghost
[55:05] come on church under the power and power
[55:10] means that there's something there's a
[55:12] force behind it again
[55:15] come to church with that Force
[55:17] oh but when we're watching a a
[55:20] basketball game or a football game or or
[55:23] whatever we like
[55:26] Mickey Mouse
[55:31] yeah
[55:33] we go anywhere and we are just oh yeah
[55:36] is OC in church
[55:42] what a shame yeah
[55:45] we're gonna clean house is what we're
[55:47] gonna do
[55:48] la casa is a rubber ballot type of the
[55:52] seventh Angelo
[55:55] and I began to think then
[55:58] how can can
[56:01] the rubble belt type the seventh Angelo
[56:06] the very names are rubber bellombres
[56:10] when you break down on the stairs
[56:15] the seed or born
[56:26] is
[56:28] born in Babylon in Babylonia born in
[56:32] confusion yeah the question is how can
[56:36] that type the seventh angel
[56:39] good question
[56:43] brother Branham says this
[56:46] my background
[56:49] is Irish Catholic is catholico
[56:53] Irish
[56:55] it was this
[56:57] so he was born into a family
[57:00] he was born in Babylon or confusion
[57:04] Babylonia he was not confused but he was
[57:09] born into confusion
[57:12] and his purpose was to take you and I
[57:15] confusion
[57:17] so how could he take us out of confusion
[57:22] if he went to confusion to pull us out
[57:27] okay now now we're making some some
[57:30] Headway now
[57:32] it had to fulfill scripture
[57:36] that the ministry of seventh Angels
[57:40] was to bring us out of Babylon or
[57:43] confusion
[57:46] Revelation Team Four
[57:50] and I heard another voice from Heaven
[57:52] saying come out of her my people that ye
[57:56] be not partakers of her sins and that ye
[58:00] receive not of her plagues
[58:10] watch the activity of the seventh seal
[58:13] come become more clearer
[58:17] in the message why I am against
[58:20] organizations
[58:25] and this Angel's message
[58:33] was echoing his message on Earth
[58:41] he was echoing his message on Earth
[58:50] his message on Earth
[58:53] to come out of Babylon
[59:04] the manifestation of the holy spirit
[59:09] is that angel
[59:12] trying to get the people back to the
[59:15] word
[59:17] I gotta say that one more time the
[59:21] manifestation of the holy spirit
[59:25] is that angel
[59:27] trying to get the people back to the
[59:31] world
[59:34] the mystery beginning to unfold
[59:38] and it's written through every type in
[59:42] the Bible
[59:44] Leviticus 18 23.3
[59:50] and you have it you can say Amen
[59:55] I don't know why I'm so dry it's
[59:58] you dry
[1:00:01] you're okay
[1:00:02] you're hydrated huh
[1:00:04] in case you need one this is for you
[1:00:06] buddy
[1:00:08] verse 23
[1:00:09] neither shalt thou lie with any Beast
[1:00:14] to defile thyself therewithamento
[1:00:22] Aman
[1:00:26] amancio
[1:00:28] but in English in English it says
[1:00:33] you say animal
[1:00:35] but in English it's beast in English
[1:00:37] they say neither shall any woman
[1:00:42] stand before a beast
[1:00:46] to lie down there too
[1:00:50] it is confusion is
[1:00:54] what's the type in the Old Testament
[1:00:58] showing you in the type
[1:01:00] so that you can understand the mystery
[1:01:03] later
[1:01:05] neither shall any woman or a woman is a
[1:01:08] church
[1:01:10] stand before a beast or a power
[1:01:16] to lie down with that
[1:01:20] it is confusion yes
[1:01:23] amen are you are you with me
[1:01:26] that scripture is pointing to the
[1:01:29] original sin is
[1:01:33] the woman lying with
[1:01:53] it is what interrupted God's rest in the
[1:01:57] beginning
[1:02:01] God is not the author of confusion
[1:02:06] or Babylon oh Babylonia confusion
[1:02:10] distracts
[1:02:15] let me tell you the mystery of the woman
[1:02:18] and the Beast
[1:02:22] brother Brian says she was the most
[1:02:24] beautiful woman that ever lived
[1:02:30] he was Beauty
[1:02:32] and she got caught up with the Beast he
[1:02:35] said
[1:02:36] it's not by coincidence why do you think
[1:02:38] people just make up these these
[1:02:42] yeah
[1:02:45] and then we feel so warm and fuzzy
[1:02:48] inside
[1:02:51] foreign
[1:02:59] yeah she did see but at the end time
[1:03:04] that man will become a beast again
[1:03:09] think about that when Saiyan is cast
[1:03:12] down
[1:03:15] in and in court himself in a man
[1:03:19] and it'll be the beastia
[1:03:23] it's just it's all there
[1:03:27] mystery Babylon the great Mysterio
[1:03:31] Babylon mother of harlots and
[1:03:33] Abominations of the earth
[1:03:37] Abomination
[1:03:39] is something contrary to the plan of God
[1:03:44] it's contrary to God's Great economies
[1:03:49] there's nothing left of the original
[1:03:51] city of Rome
[1:03:54] it ruins everywhere
[1:03:57] but here in LA
[1:04:01] that Rome is not just a city in Italy
[1:04:05] yeah
[1:04:07] in Italian Rome is a spirit
[1:04:11] that has infiltrated the whole world
[1:04:15] God help us this this morning
[1:04:19] in the message serpent seeds
[1:04:22] and that iron come from the legs which
[1:04:26] was wrong
[1:04:28] and there's a streak of romanism
[1:04:34] mixed in every
[1:04:41] through the Catholic church he says
[1:04:44] that's exactly right
[1:04:47] notice Rome exists this is the 70th week
[1:04:50] of Daniel
[1:04:53] notice Rome exists
[1:04:56] to the end
[1:05:00] oh my oh yeah because it went to the end
[1:05:04] of the toes
[1:05:07] and though there were ten toes
[1:05:11] those ten toes
[1:05:14] became the ten horns yes
[1:05:18] we'll go into that in another time
[1:05:22] but watch Iron the strength of Rome runs
[1:05:27] in all those Nations
[1:05:31] you can see how the world economy has
[1:05:34] continued to diminish and diminished
[1:05:40] till every country in the world
[1:05:44] will be busted or is busted already is
[1:05:53] because the wealth of the world was
[1:05:56] found in here
[1:05:59] have to watch this Spirit now
[1:06:02] it's so subtle that if you don't
[1:06:06] understand it or get it
[1:06:08] you won't even know it when it's got a
[1:06:11] hold of you
[1:06:13] hi I'm telling you it is so Sly this
[1:06:17] spirit is the spirit and the only way
[1:06:20] that we won't be deceived
[1:06:25] it's because there's a foundation stone
[1:06:31] that declares who's behind it all
[1:06:36] who it is that's deceiving the whole
[1:06:39] world
[1:06:41] the only ones that we will not be
[1:06:43] deceived
[1:06:45] are those whose names are written in the
[1:06:48] Lamb's Book of Life
[1:06:53] foundation stone is
[1:06:56] fundamental the Bible exposes him him as
[1:07:00] a deceiver
[1:07:03] in other words the
[1:07:06] bupin
[1:07:08] is
[1:07:10] low is
[1:07:12] he wasn't exposed when the book was
[1:07:14] closed
[1:07:15] but the opening of that book exposes
[1:07:22] you get into the message
[1:07:26] read the message put the word inside of
[1:07:30] you uh
[1:07:31] without the word you're gonna be
[1:07:34] deceived
[1:07:35] one way or another
[1:07:37] I'm I'm trying to warn you
[1:07:41] important this is
[1:07:54] watch this meet it
[1:07:57] you're a creation of the word
[1:08:03] because that foundation stone
[1:08:07] was laid in you
[1:08:10] before the foundation of the world was
[1:08:14] ever made
[1:08:16] I want you all to get that because if
[1:08:19] you got it you'd be shouting amen
[1:08:23] foundation stone is
[1:08:29] now I've gotta put it to myself
[1:08:33] foundation stone
[1:08:35] was laid in me
[1:08:38] you to tell yourself
[1:08:40] that Foundation storms
[1:08:46] before the foundation of the world
[1:08:50] predestinated
[1:08:52] to be Sons and Daughters of God
[1:09:16] for Christ is the word
[1:09:21] you can see how these world economies
[1:09:24] continues
[1:09:27] and there is no foundation for these
[1:09:30] things
[1:09:34] this is our founding pastor is
[1:09:38] watch this Revelation unfold is
[1:09:43] [Music]
[1:09:46] he takes the blood of his brother
[1:09:50] or he takes the blood forgive me
[1:09:54] and his brother is not pleased
[1:10:00] because it pleased God what his brother
[1:10:03] did
[1:10:06] in other words what Abel did
[1:10:10] displeased Kane
[1:10:16] because Cain his brother
[1:10:21] that Abel was not trying to hide the
[1:10:25] sins of his mother and father yeah
[1:10:32] evil was not not trying to hide this
[1:10:39] thing is that problem everybody's trying
[1:10:41] to hide their sins
[1:10:43] I'm trying to hide their things that
[1:10:45] they do right
[1:10:47] you can fool all the people some of the
[1:10:50] time
[1:10:53] and some of the people all the time
[1:10:59] but you cannot owe all the people
[1:11:06] and when Cain saw that able
[1:11:10] was not just sweeping it under the rug
[1:11:15] Able by Revelation knew that God
[1:11:18] required blood
[1:11:22] he he knew what had happened in the
[1:11:25] Garden of Eden
[1:11:27] there was blood that was spilled
[1:11:31] oh so what did he do he knew what God
[1:11:35] required
[1:11:37] he wasn't gonna hide it
[1:12:18] it doesn't please God because you come
[1:12:21] to church
[1:12:25] the Devil comes to church
[1:12:28] matter of fact he's the first one here
[1:12:32] you must come with the perfect sacrifice
[1:12:37] with a perfect office
[1:12:40] with the perfect mind
[1:12:43] of how to please
[1:12:47] not just coming to church
[1:12:50] if you just come to church
[1:12:52] just to come it's mystery Babylon is
[1:12:57] Mysterio de Babylonia
[1:13:00] I'm gonna say that again I will come to
[1:13:03] church just to come
[1:13:05] it's mystery Babylon is
[1:13:09] the Harlot the great
[1:13:12] mother of Harlot Madre de Ramirez we're
[1:13:16] either part of the mystery of Babylon
[1:13:18] Mysterio de baby or part of the mystery
[1:13:21] of God
[1:13:24] which one come on now you got to check
[1:13:27] yourself
[1:13:28] we're either part of one economy or the
[1:13:31] other parties
[1:13:34] what I said last Sunday
[1:13:37] one of the greatest distractions
[1:13:41] when we get into a position or office
[1:13:44] that doesn't pertain to us
[1:13:49] that's a dangerous place to be is
[1:13:57] they tried to handle the fire of God
[1:14:00] uh
[1:14:02] uh
[1:14:04] and they weren't called to do that
[1:14:07] are serious
[1:14:10] it runs through because it's showing us
[1:14:13] something
[1:14:18] how many of you believe that all that
[1:14:20] the prophets has spoke well all that the
[1:14:23] the messenger of the age brought to us
[1:14:25] Manos
[1:14:30] who doesn't that way I can have a
[1:14:32] meeting with you yeah
[1:14:36] why you don't know
[1:14:40] okay now now God's taking your word for
[1:14:42] it
[1:14:43] to give everything that the prophet
[1:14:45] spoke
[1:14:47] so let me let me preach or let me
[1:14:49] foreign
[1:15:26] I mean believe it so far
[1:15:28] so I'd rather you your pastor tell you
[1:15:31] about marriage and divorce issues
[1:15:36] and them things yes let him do it for
[1:15:41] he's God's servant too
[1:15:45] he's equipped yes
[1:15:50] so let me stop and ask the question
[1:15:54] how many of you are qualified to deal
[1:15:57] with marriage and divorce affairs
[1:16:13] it's not a trap it's the truth
[1:16:16] how many of you
[1:16:18] once again are equipped or qualified to
[1:16:22] give marriage counseling
[1:16:27] watch how Sly this is
[1:16:30] because when someone comes to us and has
[1:16:34] some issues
[1:16:36] the first thing we do is we listen to
[1:16:40] them
[1:16:41] you're out of the will of God already
[1:16:44] out of God's economies you have just
[1:16:48] become a trash can
[1:16:53] come on you said you believe God's word
[1:16:58] you said you believe God's word
[1:17:07] anyone who thinks that they're helping
[1:17:10] somebody with their marital problems
[1:17:18] you're out of your place
[1:17:21] you're in a dangerous place
[1:17:24] this is a warning to everyone
[1:17:27] because we say oh no I don't deal with
[1:17:29] those things you sit there and you
[1:17:31] listen to it
[1:17:36] of going against the word
[1:17:42] it's a warning
[1:17:45] I didn't call you to handle those things
[1:17:51] he put a pastor there
[1:17:54] says I refer them to the Past
[1:17:59] exactly what people should do is
[1:18:05] the first thing that you should tell
[1:18:07] somebody
[1:18:08] stop go talk to the pastor but uh
[1:18:13] amen amen why isn't that done
[1:18:20] oh we're cleaning we're cleaning houses
[1:18:26] oh we'll tell them that sometimes
[1:18:29] after we've sat there and heard what
[1:18:32] they had to say yes
[1:18:44] brings confusion because you're not
[1:18:47] called to deal with those things
[1:18:53] it's going to affect you sooner or later
[1:18:57] because you're not the ox of the church
[1:19:00] to carry those burdens and pull those
[1:19:03] things
[1:19:05] why do you want to do something you're
[1:19:08] not called to do
[1:19:17] it's funny how people think is Mysterio
[1:19:25] people who are in a in a specific Place
[1:19:29] what's the deception
[1:19:33] well
[1:19:35] I'm gonna go to somebody
[1:19:38] that has been through what I'm going
[1:19:40] through
[1:19:41] no one else would understand
[1:19:45] what a dumb statement
[1:19:49] you're going to go to somebody that's
[1:19:51] hidden through the same thing
[1:19:56] foreign
[1:20:00] that's why the person should
[1:20:02] automatically
[1:20:04] hold on I'm not a trash can because if
[1:20:08] you are really a friend a friend is not
[1:20:12] someone that lends their ear to you
[1:20:14] my friend is someone that will point you
[1:20:17] in the right direction
[1:20:20] correct a friend will say run to the
[1:20:23] words
[1:20:26] well they've never been to this
[1:20:29] but the help is in the word
[1:20:32] and Christ is the anointed of the hour
[1:20:38] that has been that been placed to help
[1:20:42] you in your situation
[1:20:44] he has a way out for you
[1:20:47] not everybody
[1:20:53] mad at the Devil this morning
[1:20:56] just deception and confusion
[1:20:59] after a while
[1:21:01] knows too many things about everybody
[1:21:05] so what happens we get cold in church
[1:22:11] but you know the difference between us
[1:22:14] and Satan
[1:22:17] can't experience what he believes
[1:22:22] write that one down
[1:22:25] Satan cannot experience what he believes
[1:22:30] but we as children of God
[1:23:09] in heaven
[1:23:10] about the space of half an hour is
[1:23:16] that there was silence in heaven not
[1:23:18] Earth
[1:23:20] because the activity was here on Earth
[1:23:24] now notice this now not this as we
[1:23:28] continue to go forth
[1:23:29] the Bible says that
[1:23:32] that knowledge shall increase
[1:23:38] I want to read something that brother
[1:23:40] Ron sent me this morning
[1:23:46] why is there so much deception
[1:23:51] too much knowledge
[1:23:53] we don't have the right tools to filter
[1:23:57] it
[1:23:59] unless you're a Son of God
[1:24:01] filters everything by the word
[1:24:04] okay watch this now yes the volume of
[1:24:09] knowledge
[1:24:11] watch watch what it says here
[1:24:15] the doubling rate of knowledge
[1:24:19] supportive
[1:24:25] during the the mid 20th century in
[1:24:28] Prelude
[1:24:32] knowledge would double every 25 years
[1:24:39] so you'd have to wait 25 years to get
[1:24:42] twice as smart as you guys are
[1:24:48] influencia speed which technology
[1:24:51] technology is progressing
[1:24:57] is the driver which is up ending our
[1:25:01] careers
[1:25:04] transforming lives
[1:25:07] disrupting economies
[1:25:10] and there's such a huge divide a digital
[1:25:14] divide that is being created
[1:25:17] in fact it is estimated is estimado that
[1:25:22] 90 percent of the world's data you know
[1:25:25] the information of the world's data
[1:25:29] information del Mundo was generated in
[1:25:33] the last two years alone
[1:25:37] you talk about knowledge increasing
[1:25:41] in the last two years
[1:25:46] in the space of 13 years
[1:25:50] this figure has increased by an
[1:25:53] estimated 60 times
[1:25:57] from just two zettabytes I don't even
[1:26:00] know what is that about it is
[1:26:12] that was generated in 2023
[1:26:18] is expected to increase by over a
[1:26:21] hundred and fifty percent in 2025
[1:26:26] once again knowledge was doubling every
[1:26:29] 25 years
[1:26:35] and as of 2013
[1:26:40] knowledge was doubling every 13 months
[1:26:48] but today Roy knowledge is almost
[1:26:53] doubling every day
[1:26:59] imagine that
[1:27:01] doubling every day
[1:27:04] and you start to see you exponential one
[1:27:09] day two days
[1:27:13] I mean
[1:27:15] Grace we're sitting there the other day
[1:27:17] grace estamos centados let's see how
[1:27:21] much we know let's do some trivia trivia
[1:27:27] and she was popping out answers and I
[1:27:29] was like
[1:27:31] how did you know that is
[1:27:42] there's sponges
[1:27:44] and they take knowledge knowledge
[1:27:46] knowledge knowledge knowledge but I tell
[1:27:49] you young people put on the mind of
[1:27:51] Christ
[1:27:53] you have too much knowledge coming in
[1:27:57] you don't know what to do with it
[1:28:00] you're crazy it makes you nervous too
[1:28:03] much too much you need a filter
[1:28:06] neces
[1:28:10] we're going good like I said we're just
[1:28:12] going to take our time today
[1:28:14] you're comfortable
[1:28:20] what's the key here now
[1:28:24] we talked about the reason there was
[1:28:25] silence in heaven
[1:28:29] Satan was still in heaven right
[1:28:32] during the time of the opening of The
[1:28:34] Seven Seals
[1:28:36] he's been cast down until Revelations 12
[1:28:40] 7-9
[1:28:43] God had created
[1:28:49] but it was marred
[1:28:52] during his rest
[1:28:54] mark it was
[1:28:56] um
[1:29:00] it was marked during his rest
[1:29:04] thousand years
[1:29:06] he's been making another Masterpiece
[1:29:11] how many are part of that Masterpiece
[1:29:15] God's Great economy
[1:29:17] but a masterpiece that can't and will
[1:29:20] not fail
[1:29:23] and if we don't catch the type
[1:29:26] will never catch the Anta type
[1:29:30] watch as he as we continue here
[1:29:34] Genesis 1 31 and this is we got to put
[1:29:38] all these things to understand this this
[1:29:40] explosion
[1:29:43] explosion and God saw everything that he
[1:29:46] had made and behold it was very good
[1:29:48] and the evening in the morning were the
[1:29:50] sixth day
[1:29:52] yeah
[1:29:57] under six days or six seals is the plan
[1:30:00] or book of redemption
[1:30:05] but we go in Genesis chapter 2 in Ramos
[1:30:09] uh Genesis the heavens and the Earth
[1:30:12] were finished
[1:30:15] and all the hosts of them
[1:30:18] and on the seventh day is
[1:30:21] God ended his work
[1:30:25] which he had made and he rested on the
[1:30:29] seventh day
[1:30:31] from all his work which he had made
[1:30:35] God blessed the seventh day
[1:30:39] Sanctified
[1:30:40] because that in it he had rested from
[1:30:43] all his work
[1:30:46] which God created and made
[1:30:50] if then God had finished it
[1:30:54] what was left to do
[1:30:58] what was left for the man to do yeah
[1:31:03] so
[1:31:15] what a confidence
[1:31:18] I'm gonna rest
[1:31:20] in you what you say what you do and then
[1:31:23] look at do this and look it to us is
[1:31:28] okay you're not good you're okay with
[1:31:30] that
[1:31:32] watch this watch this now we didn't meet
[1:31:34] it it was time for his son and daughter
[1:31:36] to do their part
[1:31:42] what was their part
[1:31:45] let's go back Genesis 1 28.
[1:31:49] God bless them
[1:31:51] said unto them be fruitful
[1:31:55] and multiply you're gonna need that word
[1:31:59] in a minute
[1:32:00] and
[1:32:04] replenish the Earth and subdue it and
[1:32:08] have dominion over all those things we
[1:32:11] know
[1:32:12] yes the Masterpiece
[1:32:15] their job was to begin to produce sons
[1:32:18] and daughters
[1:32:23] ah
[1:32:26] there had to be an explosion of the
[1:32:29] seventh day
[1:32:32] that would bring forth were children
[1:32:38] with me come on you gotta follow the
[1:32:41] type there have to be an explosion
[1:32:45] that would bring forth children
[1:32:48] but before
[1:32:51] the serpent came in
[1:32:54] it interrupted it all
[1:32:57] now watch as this unfolds more now
[1:33:01] the only way that God's Great economy
[1:33:04] was to function correctly
[1:33:09] it wasn't gonna function correctly with
[1:33:12] just Adam and Eve
[1:33:15] that was just the start
[1:33:19] everyone
[1:33:21] who's never written in the Lamb's Book
[1:33:24] of Life
[1:33:43] when will it come to its Perfection
[1:33:48] completion uh
[1:33:54] no no that was just the plan solo fuel
[1:33:58] plan but it was all to come to its
[1:34:01] completion or end
[1:34:04] culmination under the seventh seal
[1:34:09] all right let's see how this unfolds
[1:34:12] the types and shadows
[1:34:15] the seven seal is
[1:34:18] the end
[1:34:21] of all things
[1:34:24] this is why there's so many pieces to
[1:34:26] the seven seal uh
[1:34:30] types the Shadows but but watch it now
[1:34:34] it's the completion of all things like
[1:34:39] consummation watch what's going on here
[1:34:41] completing
[1:35:34] is the complete revealing of the mystery
[1:35:37] of God
[1:36:01] he didn't preach Christ the mystery
[1:36:04] until after the seals
[1:36:07] I'm going to say it again he did not he
[1:36:10] did not preach Christ The Mystery of God
[1:36:12] revealed till after the seals
[1:36:16] because Christ is the mystery of God
[1:36:19] revealed
[1:36:21] and the only way to see the completion
[1:36:25] of the seven seal mystery uh
[1:36:31] we must follow the continuity of it in
[1:36:34] order to know what the end looks like
[1:36:39] the mystery of God Christ is the mystery
[1:36:42] of God reveals amen
[1:36:45] amen and he
[1:36:50] cries by himself is not the end of the
[1:36:53] mystery of God
[1:36:58] I'm
[1:37:00] Christ The Mystery of God of amen amen
[1:37:04] we're waiting for more
[1:37:12] all that God was he poured into Christ
[1:37:19] here we go
[1:37:20] but we put a period there
[1:37:23] no no no no what's the continuation of
[1:37:26] the mystery
[1:37:27] and all that Christ was
[1:37:31] he poured into the church
[1:37:35] the mystery continues
[1:37:38] you know a sequence of this
[1:37:42] that's the sequence of the revelation of
[1:37:45] the seven seal mystery sequences
[1:37:51] is Christ and his bride yes United at
[1:37:56] last
[1:37:57] perfect Masterpiece it has produced Sons
[1:38:02] and Daughters were children
[1:38:09] many think that the seven seal just one
[1:38:11] thing like I said
[1:38:14] there's so many things because it's the
[1:38:17] finality
[1:38:19] of all things
[1:38:21] now watch the explosion now this is
[1:38:24] important is important
[1:38:28] in the message the seventh seals that's
[1:38:31] where we get the explosion of the seven
[1:38:33] seal yeah
[1:38:37] it's just like firing a rocket into the
[1:38:40] air we've read this so many times
[1:38:44] and that rocket is to quit this this you
[1:38:47] gotta catch this that rocket
[1:38:51] explodes here explota
[1:38:54] why because the first from the seven
[1:38:58] Thunders
[1:39:00] did they utter in heaven or Earth
[1:39:03] they uttered on Earth
[1:39:06] so that rocket explodes here first
[1:39:12] revelation of this church it explodes
[1:39:15] here
[1:39:16] and it goes up then it explodes again
[1:39:21] brother Branham then uses the phrase
[1:39:28] is that right
[1:39:31] seven thunders in heaven I thought they
[1:39:32] they stay uttered on Earth
[1:39:36] explosion was here on Earth the
[1:39:38] expressions
[1:39:45] two explosions of the rocket before the
[1:39:48] stars came out
[1:39:51] but then it puts out five stars
[1:39:56] and one of those Stars explodes
[1:40:01] and blows out five stars
[1:40:04] and one of them Stars
[1:40:08] explodes and blows out five stars from
[1:40:11] it exploitation
[1:40:16] what's going on here let's go back to
[1:40:19] the type
[1:40:20] what did he say he says God told him be
[1:40:25] fruitful
[1:40:27] and multiply that's exponential right
[1:40:31] here
[1:40:54] Hallelujah what's the explosion of the
[1:40:56] seventh seal middle Exposition and it
[1:40:59] fades on out
[1:41:00] that's what the seventh seal is it's the
[1:41:05] explosion of it it's like it's
[1:41:08] exponential
[1:41:09] are you Understanding God's Great
[1:41:11] economy
[1:41:13] watch this now and every time it
[1:41:15] explodes
[1:41:17] of God come on the scene
[1:41:22] I gotta say that again every time
[1:41:24] there's an explosion
[1:41:27] Sons and Daughters come on the scene
[1:41:31] coming to be manifested here on Earth
[1:41:37] we are here to be manifested
[1:41:42] we are the manifested sons of God
[1:41:46] every time an explosion
[1:41:50] there's a multiplication
[1:41:53] fulfilling scriptures
[1:42:01] from that Prophet came forward boom this
[1:42:04] five full minutes
[1:42:13] where were you job don't understand hope
[1:42:16] when the sons of God
[1:42:19] morning Stars
[1:42:22] and the sons of God shouted for jobs
[1:42:29] what an explosion yeah explosion but we
[1:42:32] can all glorify God praise him
[1:42:35] glorification to be an explosion in
[1:42:38] church every time we come
[1:42:42] but the reason there's nothing
[1:42:45] is because some have not yet
[1:42:49] wise that they are sons of God
[1:42:53] when you become a Son of God and you
[1:42:55] know it
[1:42:57] there's an explosion now
[1:42:59] today nothing can keep you quiet
[1:43:02] even if the deacons say calm down
[1:43:08] exploitando
[1:43:15] that's why many are still looking for
[1:43:17] something
[1:43:21] they're looking for the bride's Revival
[1:43:24] to come is
[1:43:29] now that's a that's a good one
[1:43:33] and you got to walk very careful on this
[1:43:37] no no maybe you don't agree with me here
[1:43:40] but I'm just going to tell you what the
[1:43:42] messenger said because
[1:43:46] the first thing we'll do is we'll go to
[1:43:48] the third sale
[1:43:50] and we'll say let's read that the third
[1:43:53] still okay
[1:43:56] the bride hasn't had a Revival yet
[1:44:04] hold on to that no Revival for the bride
[1:44:10] there are parts that are coming I agree
[1:44:16] but don't put everything out there
[1:44:20] come on you gotta knows there has to be
[1:44:25] a Revival here in you
[1:44:28] Awakening and Reviving
[1:44:31] in us right now
[1:44:37] we won't be there
[1:44:56] but uh
[1:44:57] that
[1:45:39] [Music]
[1:45:49] you understand don't misunderstand me
[1:45:51] here
[1:45:53] it's
[1:45:54] revealingo
[1:45:58] revealing means that a little at a time
[1:46:03] right okay that's what we understand
[1:46:06] it's revealing all the time
[1:46:09] oh here it is
[1:46:24] watch this now I I love these things
[1:46:28] but we realize
[1:46:32] that it's not all in the future
[1:46:38] he's saying this is
[1:46:43] when he's saying we're looking for it
[1:46:47] now
[1:46:49] the bride's Revival
[1:46:52] wouldn't come nowhere and couldn't come
[1:46:55] until
[1:46:59] [Music]
[1:47:03] would come and be unfolded
[1:47:06] what's going to do it to her
[1:47:09] he's only on the third sill when he
[1:47:12] makes this statement
[1:47:16] Revival means to revive or make Alive
[1:47:22] come conscious again
[1:47:25] in other words to awaken you
[1:47:30] that's what the message of the hour does
[1:47:33] it makes us conscious again
[1:47:37] that we were with him from the beginning
[1:47:41] we came from God we're gonna go back to
[1:47:45] him
[1:47:46] he will not lose not one of us oh
[1:47:54] it makes you conscious again
[1:48:00] that's why many people don't understand
[1:48:02] the New Birth
[1:48:04] the revelation of Jesus Christ
[1:48:06] personally to you
[1:48:09] and we must be born spiritually first
[1:48:13] all right
[1:48:15] oh we're born naturally but uh but we
[1:48:18] got to be born spiritually
[1:48:21] the real New Birth is when you die
[1:48:26] when you're burnt out of this corruption
[1:48:31] you're referred into incorruption
[1:48:35] burned out of mortality
[1:48:38] into immortality
[1:48:43] our first birth
[1:48:45] we were birth corruptible
[1:48:48] our second birth
[1:48:51] we're birthed Incorruptible
[1:48:54] for this Mortal must put on immortality
[1:48:59] corruption must put on incorruption is
[1:49:03] a little bit more okay Tomas all right
[1:49:07] we won't finish today but we'll
[1:49:11] bro
[1:49:14] a Revival was to take place under the
[1:49:16] seventh
[1:49:19] and so it was after the opening of the
[1:49:22] seals
[1:49:24] then brother Branham preaches message
[1:49:29] watch Revival is Awakening
[1:49:33] he preaches in 1964.
[1:49:37] after the sales were open
[1:49:40] has not had her Revival yet
[1:49:45] 1964.
[1:49:47] recognizing your day in its message
[1:49:53] he says one of the finest papers on the
[1:49:56] field
[1:49:59] Herald of his coming
[1:50:02] but they hardly will print anything
[1:50:06] unless it's fast pray fast pray and not
[1:50:10] a trumpet
[1:50:13] says
[1:50:16] oh you know we see it all the time
[1:50:21] why do they do that
[1:50:24] why do they do that he asked it twice
[1:50:29] they want a Great Awakening
[1:50:33] they're crying
[1:50:36] believing that there will be an
[1:50:39] Awakening Grace
[1:50:43] there will be an Awakening
[1:50:50] what have they done yeah they have not
[1:50:54] recognized The Awakening of the Bride
[1:51:01] oh come on when you put everything in
[1:51:03] the future
[1:51:04] you're not leaving nothing now
[1:51:08] they have not recognized
[1:51:11] The Awakening or Revival of the prize
[1:51:16] by being a Christian Cristiano they feel
[1:51:20] the pull of the hour
[1:51:22] but they haven't recognized what's been
[1:51:25] done
[1:51:27] have already been opened yes
[1:51:30] have not recognized what has been done
[1:51:34] that's what's making them feel that way
[1:51:38] something is supposed to happen

[2:07:40] I'm finishing up
[2:07:43] the pergamian church age
[2:07:46] the first son was Adam
[2:07:49] spoken word of God he was given a bride
[2:07:52] to reproduce himself
[2:07:58] and then the bride was to unite with him
[2:08:04] he's gonna Unite with with her husband
[2:08:08] produce another Son of God
[2:08:13] but watch
[2:08:15] he was supposed to
[2:08:18] reproduce himself
[2:08:24] one plus one equals
[2:08:30] that's why the bride was given to him
[2:08:33] produce himself
[2:08:39] by hybridization
[2:08:43] she caused him to die
[2:08:50] also a spoken seed word of God
[2:09:00] was given a bride as was that um
[2:09:07] she like Adam's wife was put to the test
[2:09:13] whether she would believe the word of
[2:09:15] God
[2:09:18] or doubt the word and die
[2:09:21] he doubted she left the word she died
[2:09:26] but in these last days
