more of a Spirit-filled year and more of a Spirit-filled life amen so let us turn into our scriptures here again well we got to start with the script here of the theme of the year right the day I died is the theme of the year that's what our pastor our pastor put into place First Corinthians 15 30. and why stand we in Jeopardy every hour I approach I protest by your rejoicing which I have in Christ Jesus our lord I Die daily amen you may be seated as you're being seated let's turn into one more scripture let's turn to John 5 24 and cuatro verily verily I say unto you either heareth my word and believeth on him that sent me hath everlasting life and shall not come into condemnation but is passed from death unto life a little bit on the day that the day I died [Music] you know what I I can't help but go back and give a little bit of a testimony you know and first of all it starts with a with it started with a Godly mother you know and as a young man as a young child seeing my mom reading the books hearing the tapes hearing the voice of the Prophet losses you know and that makes an impact on you yes you know as a child you know you don't realize it and uh you know but it makes that impact on you later in life you know and and uh you know as you know I remember as a little boy whenever I would get sick you know I never stayed there you know watching TV you know under the blankets since that made an impact on me I would turn on a message because in hearing what the tapes that were being played as Cucina La sientas I knew that there was healing through that voice I'm sorry you know I and you know when I was getting this ready I was just like super super emotional emotional you know you can't help but be to see what God has done in your life you know it just you want you love the Lord so much you know and seeing that as a child I I I remember hearing the voice and I remember that when I was sick I would also want to hear the voice because that was that is the void not knowing if that as a child but as an adult you understand that that was the voice of God to us in these last days you know so it's kind of started there in pesos we don't have a whole lot of time so none of you elaborate too much I prepared for 10 minutes and uh they gave me 20. so like yeah you know and and I remember there as a child growing up and hearing these words and it took me to the City of Phoenix you know and and the City of Phoenix in Las Vegas after after the after these uh the services there uh the the meetings there in Phoenix I remember me and my brother were coming out of the tent they're in Phoenix I don't know for those who were you know who we went they used to have a tent by the church you know and I remember being Jerry my brother were walking out of the tent and all I remember is hey come here foreign hey you want to go to lunch heck yeah let's go vamos you know so every I remember this for for years years and years this went on you know and and and having this experience I was I remember that that under the council I remember that under the instructions but I understood that I had access to Christ not a Christ of yesterday I don't want the crisis of 2022. and what the Christ of today and I understood by the council that I had access that I would have that I would I would have to I would have to die to myself not a partial death you know I and and in this Council that I heard I I remember hearing the tapes yes and and the tapes was a confirmation of what was being told to me it wasn't just some hearsay no no but I could I could punctuate both with an amen it was the voice of God the Earth and that the voice of God did not die when the man was buried yes and I was here with the exact same voice and still hearing that same voice the only thing that changed was the vessel but the voice is still the same and from that time there is and from that time and from that time I made a choice when family would turn their backs they would be ridiculed yeah they still made a choice to to follow the voice of the Lord foreign he says I was with the Hebrew children in the fiery furnace when the fire couldn't burn them because of the presence of the fourth Manos I was with Daniel in the parami first uh paragraph 100 I I was I was most surely with him at Calvary you want to know the day that I died and recognize right here I must be identified with him at Calvary I must be I must be there to a place that's where that we're not also I was identified with him at Calvary identity I dealt with him at Calvary Christian must die with him at Calvary Christian if you don't drive with him at Calvary you could be none of his I was there when he died I died with him how many could say that this morning and then I was with him when he raised from the dead los Muertos I come up on Easter morning with him here is the Paradox in eastern morning with him in the resurrection whatever he did I was right there how many believers every believer now some of the some of your young ones might say oh well brother Ronnie I don't I didn't have that opportunity that you did um I didn't have access to that you know to be accessible ministers everyone in here online wherever you may be yeah Mirage turn on and look well then better don't tell me you don't have the access because of the sea that was that was planted in the Neos that same thing is if that was preached to us and told to us is [Applause] it still in this place it has it hasn't changed and it will not change you have access each and every one of us this 2023 you see all these ministers here the annual winter is be identified with prices oh brother Ronnie you don't have that opportunity yes you do yes we do la tenemos the message of paradox what is a paradox something that's incredible that's a paradox that's something that's almost completely it couldn't be so but yet that same voice travel through the eternities has come to Immortal beings that's what First Corinthians says yes corruptible shall have put on incorruption and this Mortal how many morals do we have here shall be brought to pass Fame that is written the day that you died the day I died then shall come the stained death is swallowed up Muerte in Victory and Victoria and that same power is that that same Christ is let the fundamentalists let them people who deny the power of God say it's wrong but that same power that spoke the world into existence is in those people that's got the Holy Ghost is correct that's right it's correct man Hombres women it's time that we found out who we are the devil is trying to to hide you back tell you that you're some little code down something this is you are sons of the of God the deity is not in heaven staff so how can a person be dead they are dead but yet living this ain't the walking dead either right um I know you think I'm crazy but let me tell you something brother when you realize that almighty God almighty God yes when you realize today he lives in you immortal life my life I give Zoe Zoe the life of God in human beings and I'll tell you palabras you don't hear Ronnie Ronnie we hear the voice there is a power a drawing power not from the church not in Iglesia not from the pastor but from Glory Gloria the baptism the holy ghost moving down in that right Channel [Music] what is it yes the power of God through the identified Christ of all egations the accessor to his life as suvida Zoe Zoe young people urbanists older people don't want the new ones that are coming in you had the accessory you have the accessor not to a brother but you have an access to hear the voice of God amen God bless you amen [Applause] God blessed man I I'm reminded let's listen to brother Ronnie I'm reminded of of a story in the Bible and and brother Ronnie wrote a quote uh of the the three the three young men the three men that were there the Hebrew children and you know those those three Hebrew children they they found themselves in a situation and their situation was that of a desperation you see because a lot of people think that the three Hebrew children that they were just some young kids that were just kind of didn't know too much maybe they had a little bit of Faith but but I want you to understand that these three Hebrew children they were Scholars foreign that there was a desired result they knew that there was something coming but they reached a point in their life where they were so desperate they just had to see they just had to get to the point where all that they had heard of in the Bible could be made manifest to them they need needed it so bad they wanted it so bad that they began to ponder hey so one day King Nebuchadnezzar is after all the things that Daniel had done the spirit told us he builds a statue to Daniel because Nebuchadnezzar thought that Daniel was the God but when he did he built it out of pure gold and and as he as he does this and makes this construction we know the story he makes the decree is and he says you got to worship and and when when that happens all these three young men they said wait a minute we're starting to see something here I see an opportunity here I see something a picture starting to developed we might be able to create a situation in which the desired result could be manifested and so we know let's let's go to the scripture real quick Daniel chapter 3 and verse 19. and we've read this a bunch of times and it says then was Nebuchadnezzar full of Fury oh in the form of his Visage was his visit was was changed against Shadrach Meshach and Abednego you said and commanded that they should heat the furnace one seven times more and we know the story is but I want you to notice something the furnace that they were eating is it was a furnace to process gold they were building the golden image they needed to melt the gold the Lord had the furnace sitting right bye brother Jim I had to go look it up at what temperature does gold melted 1948 degrees and that was great yes 1948 degrees was enough to produce deity but I want you to know for those people just deity wasn't enough they needed something more they wanted something more they wanted to see that manifested so if you do the simple math and you multiply 1948 times 7. you arrive at a spectacular number spectacular thirteen thousand decimal 646 degrees that's the temperature that the furnace was heated to it is I started that I started to try to see the story unfold is and as I see Nebuchadnezzar and he brings these three young men in front of him you see these young men understood who they were dealing with they knew Nebuchadnezzar was a very cranky individual so the first time that he asked them he said will you bow usted they didn't timidly respond to him they didn't stand there saying no no we won't bow no no no no no no no sir no Senor they had a desired result foreign so here comes Nebuchadnezzar again I'll give it a number will you now bow and they turn back to him again I said we will not bows six times harder and by this time you could hear it feel the heat coming from the oven they were watching as men who stood around tending the furnace is just defrosting what was inside of us started to melt what was inside [Music] and when Elijah sent him and then they had studied when Joshua was encamped around that that city of Jericho is studied the strategy of going around the city is that when they blew the horns that desired result had been produced and they said to one another we've got to reproduce the animals can reproduce the same exact situation and this is my situation we've got to create something where that can be produced we need the seven times and when Nebuchadnezzar said seven times harder yet this is 13 000 degrees at 13 000 degrees is where the core of the earth is the core of the Earth runs at 13 000 degrees whatever I get burned to take the Stony heart and to change it 13 000 degrees nothing else would do for them 13 000 degrees something else would happen the basic elements of nature would begin to break down in such a way that it would open up a portal and as they walked into the furnace all the men around them dropping Dead from the heat they walked in it was and you can hear God tell wormwood wormwood can't remember the name one month says let me go down there and God says oh no no wormwood no uh this is a big man's job and he looks and he says North Windsor East and West Winds come with me because my children have created a situation in which I can be made manifest so I gotta go down there and what happened they walked into the fiery furnace and lo and behold even Nebuchadnezzar looked at the furnace and the flames and he said I see one standing as it were the Son of God but they created a situation how much more we in this day the fire is not dead and we're gonna stand word for our problem is that's the problem I asked we've become too comfortable yeah we've become real comfortable in where we're at it's the most become of us don't understand us our walk is just a good amount of distance we have just the right amount of troubles and trials we don't want to get closer to the flame because then our worldliness starts to burn off in our basic elements start to burn it's too hot in there just warm enough to stay warm and not freeze and we're comfortable but it's in that furnace that's the only place where the deity that's created is the result of melting the gold it melts together and it creates a new element is the new being and as we go into 2023 our prayer shouldn't be Lord make it easier our prayer should be Lord let's create the situations Jesus told Peter yes or was it 13 000 degrees foreign I didn't understand it Diego and Kayla I didn't understand why I'm where I'm at in London get it now I got you comfortable and I stopped in my body getting into that furnace you find yourself cold and formal informal 2023 is your year 20 minutes youth this is your time don't ask why things happen to you you know that he's creating the situation to warm up what's inside of you you didn't have the privilege that I did um foreign that fire is not dead it's just hiding just waiting for somebody to rekindle the flight [Applause] foreign my goodness how do you follow that brother Ronnie and Brother Carlos Carlos we'll do our best this morning 23.3 a new year it only brought me to this when I got the text last night Matthew 16 24 and it reads lay then said Jesus unto his disciples and since Jesus If any man will come after me let him deny himself and take up his cross to Mr Cruz and follow me 25 for whosoever will save his life and whosoever will lose his life for my sake foreign so we find ourselves in a situation I find myself in a situation brother Caleb said something in one of his sermons and he was talking about how the Jews believe something how was in this Western World how we believe how we believe in this area we believe it by information we know definitions to words and we speak words but we see the Jews what he does the way he knows certain words so we see that only just say per se the word love since we've been talking about it but they live it out so they actually go and love somebody so there's many times even as ministers many times we know definitions definitions we speak it or we preach it but we never go and act it out so I find myself in certain areas in my life I have a lot of information I speak a lot of things but I don't live a lot of those things so it's a predicament we find ourselves in a predicament you know brother Ronnie took me down memory lane because he said that it was through a Godly mother and I can confirm that because all I've ever seen from her is someone stands through thick and thins someone stand with her husband through thick and thin even though he wasn't in the message someone that stood with her pastor are you thinking when people would maybe speak evil she was one of the ones that stood because remember that your children are watching your children are looking up to you they're looking at how we handle situations how we react to certain things how we react when certain bad things happen in our lives they're watching so they'll always remember that so when they grow up they're either going to react the way they're going to react to what they saw so if you're a golly man or a woman and you stand through any opposition more than likely the children will stand the same way possible but if we run tuck Taylor and run for anything that's probably what the children will do so in saying this so I remember my brother he's six years younger than me at that time I was doing my own thing but through the instruction of her mother through the Council of like he said of our past founding pastors but I would watch him because he would go and he would read brother Branham books all the time and what he would do is he would initial them just for the ones that he read so I went into his room one time and I looked and he had a stack probably about that big a little boy because of a Godly mother through instructions that he received it started that spark Brother Carlos in that young man so me being older I would actually look up to him to know that this is where God dwells to know that the what the prophet says where we have to do this this year it has to be what's called The Chain Reaction it has to happen in us first it has to happen in the individual first I have to get knowledge I have to but I have to act now does that make sense to everybody so if I preach peace but I don't live peace there's something missing elements in me and me amen amen watch Watch chain reaction it's a chemical reaction or a process in which the products themselves promote or spread the reaction which under certain conditions May accelerate dramatically number two Segunda a series of events by the previous one so keep the word chain reaction in mind look at each other really quick just look at each other and I'll do that for a reason okay but we have to die to ourselves we have to carry our cross and die to ourselves so that this human nature this the human Tendencies of wanting to just speak so what we have to do today as this fire this this flame of brother Henry and he comes and he ignites me then I can go and ignite this brother can ignite you know there's elements that make up a fire Elementos it's needed to sustain combustion is some type of fuel right it has to burn something whether it's wood whatever and heat obviously the fire puts our heat a heat source is but you know that there's a fourth element that fourth element is the fire itself it's like I said it's just a flame if it's by itself but it actually turns into a fire a raging fires when there's a chain reaction in the people like I said first of all in the individuals then to your brother now is it a coincidence that there was a fourth element in the fire with the three Hebrew children there was a fourth one in there there was a fourth man in there and that was God in us yes we die to ourselves we get ignited no sense the fourth element is a combustion to ignite your brothers and that's only him only he could do this like I said we're dead to ourselves and burn everything out of us because we even have to love foreign and the form of the fourth is like the Son of God and one quote he says he fanned the fire okay he found the fire from them they use have you ever found a fire before what happens when you fan of fire now don't think of the Hebrew children back then foreign but just and and they were tested if we don't provados are we tested today we need not go through tests every day that's all we have to Die daily is located they have to keep that fire going we have to add the oxygen the fuel is because they cannot burn out if it burns we start to get cold because you get isolated we start to think that people don't love us to think that the passion doesn't care about it or the minister doesn't care about us They don't love me in that church so I gotta isolate myself watch this and we're and they were tested whether they would worship images and break the word of God they stay true to the word regardless of the circle they say true to the words and when they were thrown them into the ferry watch this here I don't understand when they throw them into the fiery furnace God's promise was fulfilled they were thrown into the fiery foreign God's promise was fulfilled they possessed the gates of their enemies but there was a fourth man that unlocked from the fire del Fuego and it could do nothing but set them free because this you know why there was a key because this year is you can't get worn from a painted fire usted this year the heat is going to come out of that painter each and every one of us we have the key we have the council we've been talk correct we had the apostles and you shall not walk in the manners foreign not this year no estano this year is a different year because because our pastors rallying the church and this is the year yesterday I think whether we like it or not we have to pick up our crafts so we got a text last night at about 11 o'clock usually ask us and he said there's a few guys going up um you and your brother are are one of those who stays so I think this is what we have in store this fire will come and burn everything out of us so that the new creation we know that after all this the Millennium after everything it will require a fire Romano that's all I have for you thank you gracias and uh may God bless you in this new year and our goal is only to get closer to him God bless you thank you [Applause] to thee o God do we give thanks unto thee do we give thanks for that thy name is near thy wondrous Works declare God's wondrous Works in 2022 in 2022 seven new babies were added to our congregation this year we had loved ones go on to be with the Lord the Lord provided 1284 luganda Bibles to his people in Uganda this year foreign the church was established in Norway famine killed many people in Uganda but God is gracious through the ministry none of God's people have died of famine more than 9 500 people have been fed by the Lord in Uganda countless numbers of people have been reached through the radio broadcast every day it has been heard by people that we

that we're thinking of around the world into the Asian over into Europe all around Lord Let It Be Your Will and your power that'll lead to these things and if we should at any time be stepping off of
