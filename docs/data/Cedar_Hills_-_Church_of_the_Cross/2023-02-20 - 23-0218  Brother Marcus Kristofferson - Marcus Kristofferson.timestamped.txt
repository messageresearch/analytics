[5:20] good morning everyone
[5:22] are you happy this morning
[5:26] it's a it's a great testimony to see
[5:29] that all of you are here this morning
[5:33] because it's so many people that so many
[5:37] youth they're laying drunk in a dish
[5:40] this morning but you
[5:43] stood up for Christ when you came here
[5:46] this morning
[5:47] and that's a testimony
[5:49] so
[5:50] whatever people say to you you always
[5:53] have the testimony to show and to
[5:56] Proclaim to the full angels that you
[6:00] have a Christ you have a savior that
[6:02] died for you and protects you day and
[6:05] night
[6:07] so
[6:09] I usually behind this book but I get
[6:13] very formal but this morning I will try
[6:16] to relax and just talk with you guys and
[6:20] I hope that we can get to know each
[6:23] other better
[6:24] and
[6:25] that I can
[6:29] I can tell something from my life that
[6:32] maybe can encourage you and help you to
[6:35] understand that we are on the same team
[6:37] we are fighting for the same
[6:40] same course and we are going going to
[6:43] the same place
[6:44] we're going home
[6:46] to replace we came from
[6:49] so
[6:51] I I just want to read a portion from the
[6:55] scripture this morning
[6:57] and
[7:00] we will open up
[7:02] the Bible in James
[7:06] chapter five
[7:09] verse 16.
[7:14] so do everyone have their Bible this
[7:16] morning
[7:18] because the Bible is your sword
[7:21] is the thing you fight with so
[7:25] if you don't have your bubble this
[7:27] morning
[7:29] this is last day
[7:31] you forgot your Bible
[7:34] you always need to bring your Bible
[7:37] because if I tell you to go into the
[7:40] bathroom with somebody in the world you
[7:43] will always bring a tool with you
[7:45] so bring your Bible
[7:48] but let's read
[7:51] and it reads from James chapter 5 verse
[7:54] 16.
[7:56] confess your faults one to another and
[7:59] pray one for another that ye may be
[8:02] healed the effectual fervent prayer of a
[8:05] righteous man a valid match
[8:09] let's power heads
[8:12] dear heavenly father I'm so grateful for
[8:15] this morning
[8:16] that we could wake up and we could talk
[8:21] to you this morning
[8:23] that we could come in peace relax in
[8:27] front of your throne of Mercy
[8:29] that we can stand and talk together
[8:33] about what you did for us
[8:35] that's the youth here in Las Cruces and
[8:39] all the visitors that there are here
[8:41] this morning
[8:42] that they can come with an open heart
[8:45] and they don't need to fear anything
[8:49] because
[8:50] whatever that is said from this Pulpit
[8:53] is from you Lord
[8:55] that they can relax and that they can
[8:59] take this word and convert it into life
[9:01] and bring it
[9:04] to be a part of their testimony and
[9:06] their their walk in the Lord
[9:09] so we ask that your angel will come and
[9:12] be amongst us this morning we welcome
[9:14] your Holy Ghost
[9:16] to jump from heart to heart and make a
[9:19] rejoicing
[9:21] moments together so we ask this in your
[9:25] precious holy name amen
[9:28] you may be seated
[9:33] so
[9:35] I just want to ask
[9:37] how many is
[9:40] younger than 12 years older
[9:44] is everybody other than 12 years old
[9:48] it's very good
[9:49] yeah you want to go there
[9:52] it's very nice
[9:55] when I was
[9:56] 12 years old
[9:58] I had
[9:59] a huge
[10:01] struggle in my life
[10:03] I was
[10:05] was I was dragged back and forth
[10:08] we had youth gatherings
[10:11] but it was so hard for me to live the
[10:14] right life because I had a lot of
[10:16] friends that was pulling me
[10:19] they wanted me to play soccer and
[10:22] everything that this world wants to give
[10:25] us
[10:25] but I I had heard from my parents that
[10:29] watch out for those things
[10:30] because it's it's spirits that tries to
[10:34] to occupy your time
[10:37] many times the things you do it seems
[10:40] harmful
[10:41] but
[10:43] it tries to take your time and your time
[10:47] is so important
[10:49] because God wants all your time
[10:53] so when I was 12 years old
[10:57] I had a very good friend of mine and he
[11:01] was kind of like a dad for me because my
[11:04] dad
[11:05] that you saw yesterday
[11:07] that was not that I grew up with because
[11:10] my dad was very sick
[11:13] for many many years
[11:15] he was sleeping many hours a day
[11:19] and
[11:21] he he always was there for me but
[11:24] when I wanted to go out to play
[11:27] he he didn't have the strength to come
[11:31] together with me
[11:33] so that was a hard time for me
[11:35] but I had a very good friend that was
[11:38] kind of like a father for me that I used
[11:41] to to go to and do all the fun things
[11:45] with but when I wanted to have some good
[11:48] advices I went to my dad
[11:51] because he was
[11:53] my good advisor
[11:56] so
[11:58] we had all these U.S Gatherings once a
[12:01] month
[12:02] and we was approximately yeah I think at
[12:05] most 30 30 youths in Norway
[12:09] and
[12:12] we used to go maybe up in the forests
[12:16] found a cabin and sing some songs and
[12:20] barbecue and just have have a good time
[12:24] and and
[12:27] the most important thing we did was to
[12:29] talk about the Lord
[12:31] and to to talk
[12:34] about each other not always about the
[12:37] scripture but about
[12:40] each other what what is happening around
[12:43] us and however everyone is doing
[12:47] and
[12:48] suddenly on one of those trips it was
[12:51] something touched me
[12:53] and I just broke down
[12:55] and I felt into tears and I knew that
[12:59] this is my time now I need to take a
[13:03] choice
[13:04] to choose God or the world
[13:07] so I decided to baptize
[13:12] and
[13:14] and I had turned 13 years old when I I
[13:18] made a choice
[13:24] so
[13:25] we went to Convention and I got baptized
[13:30] but
[13:31] it didn't happen
[13:33] so much after that I thought that my
[13:36] life was going to change
[13:37] dramatically dramatically
[13:40] but it was
[13:42] it was the same after and I couldn't
[13:45] understand why
[13:47] because I heard that when you baptized
[13:49] you will be filled with a Holy Ghost
[13:51] and all your troubles will disappear
[13:55] but I got into more trouble
[13:59] it got so worse
[14:02] and it stayed on for many years
[14:05] and it was so hard for me
[14:07] it was like my dad's spoke yesterday
[14:10] about the dark room
[14:13] and but I have
[14:16] baptized so I had that red color that
[14:19] was protecting me all the way
[14:22] so that was the only thing that kept me
[14:26] I didn't knew that but when I looked
[14:29] back I understand that something kept me
[14:33] so
[14:35] and
[14:36] the time went by
[14:38] and when I was 16 years old how many
[14:42] year is 16 years old
[14:44] 16. nice
[14:47] when I was 16 I moved out from home
[14:52] so I wanted to leave my parents
[14:56] and Eros because of school but because
[14:59] of my parents
[15:01] but I needed
[15:04] instead of traveling like two or three
[15:07] hours to school every morning I moved to
[15:09] another city
[15:10] but
[15:12] the time got even worse for me when I
[15:15] left my parents and that was a very hard
[15:19] time
[15:21] because you know I I grew up in a
[15:25] message
[15:26] I gained so much knowledge about this
[15:29] message
[15:30] my father has been a preacher his whole
[15:33] life
[15:34] they come from the the Pentecostal
[15:36] denomination
[15:39] and and so he preached there and then he
[15:42] kept on going we received the message
[15:44] and
[15:46] I have three siblings
[15:48] I'm the youngest one
[15:51] and
[15:54] during that time
[15:57] growing up in a message
[16:00] we we actually didn't talk about the
[16:03] message among the youth because we were
[16:06] in the message so why why should we talk
[16:09] about the message when you are in the
[16:11] message
[16:13] are you familiar with that
[16:17] are you talking about the message
[16:19] or DIY avoid it
[16:23] because so many times you think that
[16:27] I am saved I don't need to talk about
[16:29] this message because I'm I'm saved and
[16:33] you're avoid it
[16:34] so you you won't end up in arguing with
[16:38] people about the message
[16:40] and
[16:42] so
[16:43] but
[16:46] during those years when I was in church
[16:49] and
[16:51] we we went to service
[16:54] every Sunday and Wednesday nights
[16:57] foreign
[17:04] because we we never spoke about the
[17:07] message together we we were talking
[17:09] about what we did on our spare time and
[17:13] what we were supposed to do in the
[17:16] weekends
[17:17] but
[17:18] not about the message and
[17:21] it was something missing in my life and
[17:24] I didn't feel I feel like home
[17:27] so
[17:29] so I went further and further away from
[17:33] the message
[17:34] I was still in the church but that was
[17:37] only for two hours on Sunday
[17:39] and that is not the LIE
[17:42] that's a religion
[17:44] and you're not a part of her religion
[17:46] you're part of Christ they're part of of
[17:49] a body
[17:51] so
[17:54] I had drifted away
[17:56] and
[17:59] I like to do skiing
[18:01] skiing is my favorite thing to go go out
[18:05] in the wilderness
[18:07] and find the highest peak
[18:09] and climb it
[18:11] and then ski down
[18:14] and
[18:15] it's
[18:16] it it's kinda peaceful because it's like
[18:20] flying down the mountain
[18:23] and you just come to Norway and try it
[18:27] I invite you all and I'll take you for a
[18:30] tour
[18:31] and it's it's really nice
[18:35] so
[18:36] this was so good to me skiing so I
[18:41] started to skip the services
[18:44] Sunday after Sunday because I really
[18:47] like skiing
[18:48] it's it's harmful it's only skiing
[18:51] but as gift service
[18:54] and
[18:56] skipping service
[18:59] is
[19:00] skipping a fellowship with Christ
[19:04] and
[19:06] I didn't knew that it was harmful for me
[19:09] to skip service
[19:11] because
[19:13] I I wasn't drinking I was in smoking I
[19:16] was in partying I was only skiing and
[19:18] why why should that be harmful
[19:22] but you know
[19:24] Sunday after Sunday skipping skipping
[19:27] skipping
[19:29] I
[19:30] I started to lose something
[19:33] that's
[19:36] that I should that have in my life
[19:41] but
[19:44] it was in
[19:45] I think it was in in
[19:48] 2000 and
[19:52] 14. some years ago
[19:56] that I was in the end of high school
[20:01] and
[20:03] I was thinking of
[20:05] becoming a engineer and
[20:09] become something great
[20:11] and study
[20:14] but at the same time I was living living
[20:17] alone
[20:18] and every day
[20:21] when I came back from school I was
[20:24] switching on the TV looking on movies
[20:28] I was having on music
[20:31] and when I was cooking food I was
[20:33] looking at movies
[20:35] when I was eating I was looking at
[20:37] movies all day and night
[20:39] day in and day out
[20:42] and it felt like that it got darker and
[20:46] darker and darker and darker in the life
[20:49] and it was a terrible time
[20:54] but
[20:56] I knew about the truth because I had
[20:59] been there
[21:00] but I I was trying to avoid it
[21:04] I thought that
[21:06] I I am so clever I can I can kind of out
[21:10] of this myself
[21:12] but
[21:14] Satan is stronger
[21:17] than that he when he gets a hold of you
[21:21] he won't let go
[21:24] when you stand alone he'll take you and
[21:27] try to force you down
[21:30] so
[21:33] during that year
[21:35] I was
[21:37] I was
[21:38] cast into so so many things
[21:41] and nobody saw it
[21:44] because I was all by myself in the
[21:47] apartment I had
[21:48] when I was
[21:50] when I was
[21:51] sometimes going to service
[21:54] everything seemed nice
[21:56] I was
[21:58] praying and reading my Bible and singing
[22:01] listening to the preacher
[22:04] but when I get put out of the service
[22:07] went back home I was back in the ditch
[22:11] but nobody saw it
[22:13] so my sister always said oh mark
[22:17] you're such a nice and good Christian
[22:20] boy
[22:22] you never do nothing wrong
[22:25] but I knew that that's not the life I
[22:28] live I live a different life I'm I'm
[22:31] hiding and nobody sees it so
[22:38] are you family familiar with that
[22:42] to to be
[22:45] to hide and and try to live a life
[22:50] and and and you can't live it you know
[22:53] the truth
[22:54] and
[22:56] but it's it's something that's
[22:59] you you're not able to to come true to
[23:03] really live that life
[23:06] you're trying to hide
[23:08] and
[23:10] it's it's Satan
[23:13] that is pulling you away from the
[23:17] message
[23:18] he tries to get a hold of you
[23:21] to put you into to things that
[23:24] maybe it looks harmless
[23:27] but he tries to occupy your mind all the
[23:30] time
[23:31] in basketball movies
[23:34] and sucker everything
[23:38] going to the gym it can be everything
[23:42] it's your time
[23:47] so during that year
[23:49] I was
[23:50] I was cast into pornography movies music
[23:56] and lots of things
[23:59] and you know
[24:00] all of those things
[24:03] was for free I didn't have to pay for
[24:06] anything of those
[24:07] it came for free so it was so easy to to
[24:11] end up on in those things
[24:14] and Satan when I I conquered one thing
[24:19] he just gave me another thing
[24:22] and it kept on going
[24:25] but it was one important thing that I
[24:28] did that year
[24:31] two times a week I went home to my
[24:35] parents
[24:36] and I had conversations with my dad
[24:40] and I knew that
[24:42] I shouldn't go home because he is
[24:45] telling me the truth but it was
[24:47] something that was probably me go home
[24:49] and talk to Dad or listen to that I I
[24:53] never said something to him
[24:55] so he didn't knew that I was suffering
[24:59] because I was hiding it from everybody I
[25:02] didn't tell anybody
[25:05] but during during that year
[25:09] he
[25:10] said so many things and it was like
[25:15] like a picture and I didn't see the
[25:18] picture
[25:19] but as
[25:20] I I received a lot of pieces of that
[25:23] pictures
[25:24] of that picture
[25:27] but I
[25:29] I didn't I wasn't able to put those
[25:32] pieces together because I lived a
[25:35] different life
[25:37] then that he told me to live
[25:41] so
[25:43] every every time I went home
[25:46] when I came back to my apartment
[25:49] it got darker
[25:52] I went to my dad and it got darker and
[25:55] it kept on going
[25:57] and in the church I went to I I every
[26:02] every time before the service I was
[26:04] kneeling down and I was praying
[26:07] and I told the Lord that I can't do this
[26:12] this is too hard for me
[26:14] it's it's something I I can't understand
[26:19] so Lord please help me
[26:22] but there was no help coming
[26:25] and I was trying I was trying and I was
[26:27] trying
[26:28] and after a while
[26:31] I made a promise
[26:33] the Lord a very strange promise because
[26:37] the promise was that
[26:39] I'm not going to read the Bible anymore
[26:42] but I will stay faithful in prayer but I
[26:45] will stop reading the Bible
[26:47] because I don't understand any word of
[26:50] it
[26:52] and it got darker and darker and I knew
[26:55] that it was a wall waiting for me and I
[26:58] one day I will hit that wall
[27:01] and at this time I was
[27:04] I was actually 19 years old
[27:07] so baptized when I was 13 years old
[27:11] and still now 19 years old
[27:15] struggling a lot
[27:20] and
[27:21] as I was walking towards this wall
[27:25] darker darker darker and
[27:30] I use all my times with the things I
[27:33] shouldn't do
[27:35] I was I was praying and praying Lord
[27:38] what what do you want to show me why why
[27:43] are you doing this to me because the
[27:45] Bible the Bible that I knew but I didn't
[27:48] read anymore
[27:50] said that if you pray you'll get an
[27:53] answer but I I didn't get an answer and
[27:57] I couldn't understand why
[27:58] why Lord why are you doing this to me
[28:02] and do you feel it light like that
[28:05] sometimes you pray for something
[28:09] Time After Time After Time
[28:11] and it seems like you don't get any
[28:14] answer
[28:17] and why why is that happening
[28:22] and one day
[28:25] my dad called
[28:27] Marcus
[28:29] please come home
[28:30] I need to tell you something
[28:32] and I was thinking okay yeah yeah I'll
[28:35] come home and and we'll have a talk or I
[28:40] will listen to you again
[28:42] so I went went home and and we were
[28:46] taking a walk out in the wilderness
[28:50] and he was just telling me some some few
[28:53] things
[28:54] and I was thinking yeah I I hear what
[28:57] you say but it doesn't matter because I
[28:59] I'm not able to live that life
[29:03] and
[29:05] and then he said he gave me a scripture
[29:11] and that is Luke 24 25
[29:28] and that reads
[29:30] Dennis said unto them of Fools and slow
[29:33] of Hearts to believe all that the
[29:36] prophets has spoken
[29:39] and in that moment
[29:41] when he said that scripture
[29:44] it was like the heaven opened for me and
[29:49] and my dads didn't realize but in my
[29:52] life in my heart it was something
[29:54] special happening
[29:56] I couldn't understand why what is
[29:59] happening to me right now
[30:02] but to believe all that the prophets
[30:05] have spoken
[30:07] I I realized that for so many years I
[30:12] had tried to fight this fight alone
[30:16] and I didn't believe
[30:20] all things that the prophet had spoke
[30:24] I had believed my own words
[30:28] not the prophet's word
[30:31] and
[30:32] when when Dad gave me that scripture the
[30:36] the Bible and a message
[30:39] everything he had said the past year in
[30:42] our conversation
[30:44] all the puzzles came together
[30:46] like like a big picture for me
[30:50] and I understood that now something
[30:54] happened
[30:55] and that was the day I died in myself
[31:00] I totally gave up myself
[31:03] and
[31:05] and from that day on
[31:09] my my life turned
[31:12] and I began to read the scripture again
[31:14] to listen to messages
[31:17] and
[31:19] that kept on going for for a long while
[31:23] but Satan he came with an even bigger
[31:27] Army trying to defeat me one more time
[31:31] but now I had the scripture
[31:34] the Bible
[31:36] that I could use
[31:38] because
[31:40] you know that when Jesus was was tempted
[31:46] Satan tried to tell him that
[31:50] just just do these wondrous
[31:53] and I will give you the whole Earth
[31:57] but Jesus knew that if I'm listening to
[32:00] that voice I'm a boy
[32:02] I'm obeying that voice
[32:06] I'm obeying Satan
[32:09] so
[32:11] in my life I had obeyed Satan
[32:16] everything he said to me
[32:18] I obeyed it
[32:20] and
[32:21] that was the fault I did I was obeying
[32:25] the wrong voice
[32:28] and
[32:31] and
[32:33] so so after after this time
[32:37] I
[32:39] I I started to live a new life
[32:43] a good life
[32:45] but still it was a fight
[32:48] because
[32:50] growing growing up in the message
[32:54] has everybody here
[32:57] parents in in the message
[33:06] have you grown up in a message
[33:13] you know when you grow up in a message
[33:16] you gain a lot of knowledge
[33:19] you know so much about the message
[33:22] but has it become a revelation to us
[33:27] or not
[33:29] is it a knowledge or a revelation
[33:33] and that was my big struggle
[33:36] is this only things I know
[33:40] or is it revealed to me
[33:45] that you know
[33:46] when when
[33:48] you are aware of those things and you
[33:52] are thinking
[33:53] is this only knowledge
[33:55] or is it revealed to me
[33:58] when when you are having those thoughts
[34:02] it's a spirit
[34:05] that tries to tell you its knowledge
[34:09] but listen to the spirits that tells
[34:12] that this is a revelation it's a peace
[34:15] maybe you don't know that this person
[34:20] that you know about
[34:22] is something that is a part of your
[34:27] picture the image that you know of
[34:30] the image that you are created after
[34:35] that the things you know
[34:38] maybe it's something you don't
[34:41] understand
[34:42] but it's something that you are supposed
[34:45] to use
[34:47] later in your life
[34:51] so
[34:54] the first scripture we read
[34:57] about confess your faults one another
[35:01] and pray one for Honor
[35:04] you know the reason why we are supposed
[35:06] to do that
[35:08] the reason
[35:09] is to not end up like me
[35:12] spending
[35:14] six
[35:15] or seven years of my life
[35:17] alone
[35:19] if you start using this scripture to
[35:22] confess your faults
[35:24] maybe it's a small thing
[35:26] because it's it's easy to confess small
[35:29] things but the big things it's it's hard
[35:32] to confess
[35:33] because you think that oh it's only me
[35:36] having this problem
[35:39] but if you start practicing
[35:43] to confess Small Things oh today I said
[35:46] something bad to my brother
[35:48] pray for me help me
[35:52] and
[35:53] you know why
[35:55] we should confess
[35:59] it's because
[36:01] my testimony
[36:03] is your testimony
[36:06] because we are part of one body
[36:11] so if you think that your problem is
[36:15] only your problem
[36:16] that is wrong because your problem is my
[36:20] problem
[36:22] because we are a part of the same body
[36:26] you understand
[36:28] how many people have some problems today
[36:32] be honest everybody has a problem
[36:36] maybe you ain't practicing enough maybe
[36:42] you and kind enough
[36:44] is always something we have problems
[36:46] with
[36:48] but
[36:49] that's a good sign because then you have
[36:52] something to conquer because we are
[36:54] Overcomers
[36:56] for Christ
[36:58] so
[37:00] I want to encourage you to to start
[37:04] confess
[37:07] to somebody
[37:09] to find somebody to talk to
[37:12] and
[37:14] and confess your faults because
[37:19] before the foundation was laid
[37:22] we were together
[37:24] as one big great family
[37:28] and
[37:30] we we are having an amnesia
[37:35] that is our biggest problem amnesia
[37:39] because we don't remember what happened
[37:41] back there
[37:42] because
[37:44] we are in a flesh
[37:47] and our memory is so bad
[37:51] that's why you see the world they're
[37:54] repeating the same things they go into
[37:56] World War it goes sometime and then
[37:59] they'll have a World War again
[38:03] they never learn
[38:05] but we we have a way to learn
[38:10] and when you confess to your brother
[38:16] and it's it's not embarrassing to tell
[38:19] your brother or sister about your faults
[38:21] because in this body
[38:24] we are trapped in this body
[38:27] this body doesn't don't belong to us
[38:30] this is flesh and blood
[38:32] we are a spirit
[38:34] and we are going back to a spirit form
[38:37] so when you confess
[38:40] to a friend of yours
[38:42] or to somebody
[38:44] that's you trust
[38:47] then your memory will start coming back
[38:52] you will understand who you were
[38:56] and
[38:58] that the things
[39:00] you are doing that seems to be wrong
[39:04] is only something that you are trapped
[39:07] in it's not the real you
[39:12] so
[39:15] when we help each other
[39:18] to get this memory back
[39:21] to talk about the scripture because the
[39:24] scripture is a story about you and me
[39:28] when you understand that that we are
[39:30] reading about ourselves because we are
[39:33] part of one body
[39:35] the body of the Lord Jesus Christ
[39:41] and the memory starts coming back you
[39:44] understand that oh
[39:48] that was me that was the choice
[39:51] that I made before the foundation of
[39:55] this world was laid
[39:59] then you start to live another life
[40:03] your problems you understand that this
[40:07] is just something that's that is trying
[40:09] to hit you down hit you down all the
[40:12] time
[40:14] but when you can together with your
[40:17] brother and sister
[40:18] speak about your your your testimony
[40:23] and and your life
[40:25] the memory about who you really were
[40:30] comes back and we know that the prophet
[40:33] says that the day you understand who you
[40:38] really are
[40:39] that is the day you will be translated
[40:44] and we will
[40:46] go into an outer body
[40:48] and into the spirit that we belongs to
[40:53] and we have we have these angels around
[40:55] us that is helping us all the time
[41:00] so
[41:01] this is only some
[41:04] few humble words I wanted to share with
[41:07] you
[41:09] to help each other to bring the memory
[41:12] back
[41:13] that the things you're struggling with
[41:16] with it's it's nothing special for you
[41:20] all of us are struggling with the same
[41:23] thing
[41:24] your trouble is my trouble
[41:26] and if one part of the body is hurting
[41:31] the whole body is hurting
[41:33] but if you don't tell about
[41:36] your life
[41:38] then it will be hard for somebody else
[41:41] to help you
[41:42] so try not to do like I did to hide to
[41:48] close my door and be for myself because
[41:51] when I was for myself
[41:54] Satan and his army with his Fallen
[41:57] Angels was so strong
[42:00] and kept me down for so long time
[42:04] but when I started to to join people and
[42:10] talk about this message message
[42:12] it became easier and easier and easier
[42:15] still is a fight because we are supposed
[42:18] to be Overcomers
[42:20] if you don't conquer some something you
[42:23] can't be an overcomer
[42:25] and if you don't have a scar you haven't
[42:28] been in a battle
[42:29] so we need scars to show that we have
[42:34] overcome something
[42:37] so
[42:39] I want to encourage you to to start talk
[42:43] about your life
[42:45] and
[42:46] because
[42:47] it can come a time that you really need
[42:50] to have
[42:52] a good friend that can help you out
[42:56] if
[42:57] you have confessed to your friends
[43:02] for a for a time they they get they get
[43:06] to know you and
[43:07] they can see that oh now he's struggling
[43:11] I need to go and talk to him
[43:15] so
[43:17] take this scripture
[43:19] take a video
[43:21] and start using it
[43:23] because this this scripture is
[43:28] is for getting healed
[43:31] but
[43:33] I think it's it's one week ago when I
[43:36] got this scripture
[43:38] I understood that this scripture is
[43:43] here for me to bring my memory back and
[43:47] your memory back
[43:49] so take this scripture with you
[43:52] and use it
[43:54] and help each other
[43:56] to get the memory back
[43:58] and I'll tell you that the thing you are
[44:02] struggling with you will understand that
[44:05] that is just something you are trapped
[44:07] in
[44:07] it's not your fault
[44:10] you're trapped in it
[44:12] you made a decision before
[44:15] the foundation of this world and you
[44:17] chose
[44:19] the message
[44:21] that Michael came with
[44:25] and the things you're struggling with
[44:28] that is not you
[44:30] not the real you it can seems like
[44:33] because
[44:35] we feel like oh this this is my life
[44:40] but this is not
[44:43] what is you
[44:44] you are the choice you made back there
[44:48] so God bless you
[44:51] and I hope that
[44:53] it was something that you could read
[44:56] relates to and that you could understand
[44:59] anything of it
[45:03] so God bless you
[45:08] [Applause]
