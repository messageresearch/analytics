that we're not close already Sarah Correa this message that I preached today is a very touchy message estimate sake break away from ahem we daily column it is a part of the finishing touches its part they say yes this message is part of it of the finishing the Messiah's part a Lester - Eunice you might not jump in shouted a mistake he said no greeting probably how you want to know this message right now where do you go estimate or be anointing for this day Esther leukemia nope arrest idea are you with me amigo know we sometimes would rather jump and shout Oh there's time but right now this is the annoying little outta me more systematic genius because he like yes that is being produced or has produced harvest case that's in the foolproof único section I'm not even gonna go there because then I'll preach you next and this meadow in IE Porto optical image is now a feminist when we look at this one to me Ramos says everyone has their own ideas whose propia see yes even what they think of the message or what they think of the scriptures you say I look at that missus domestically to that yet it shouldn't be that way I want to know Vidya said this terminate I realize that our past or our ideas or the way that we think know that most cuenta que la manera que nosotros paints them off there they have been formed by past influences and still four miles per influences whether in our lives yes yes whether in in another church that we used to attend 103 glaze ain't kept your home or school a glaze but the message of the hour as we heard please you're not some new idea Lewis good idea and whether I'm here to tell you is the message of the hour it means secondary thoughts of guys and hope you paint some analysis it throw a body here on earth we're partying up here that's why we tend many times to lean one way or the other what is the most whether it is issues in life Jessica see whether it is because of influences oh poor case here they come whether it is issues in a church oh poor Casey and that's why everybody has their idea for the way that a church should be run what is it come here they come on like lazy I said career but I want to tell you that well you look it is not my idea of how this church should be rise me there como esta Khaleesi I said because if caleb is running the church the way he thinks for kids in America live is that Korean League lacy ostomies indignation feel sorry for all of you miss Ito multiple coronal face I say it again I feel sorry for all of you momentum is being deceived stancine yeah so now if it's the Holy Spirit or a Csilla speedy - that is guiding and rolling the church no ego burn and what we're looking to is the Lucas caboose can now now now notice this now Auto survey nice I got a kick out of the the brother there for the changing Lamanna cheese we were as we were there in in the seminar of the pastor seminar that was making a point just I was in the Punto and I said y-you don't brother brothers I was speaking to two to three men the other day and I said I told him I don't trust you and I don't trust you and I don't trust you your lady here your lady here use no community no confidence in our Co and and I said but I do trust the Holy Spirit in you and in you and in you he it'll he come fearless be a dream and a brother who started at the end was started they were singing a song and by he just started on his making making up his own version yes love him I don't trust you know this and I don't trust your neighbor and then he goes on and says but what I do trust is the spirit in you anyway we got a song out of that that's the truth of the matter but in beans we failed each other but I want to always remember okay look they seemed pretty quick for us to always realize that what we rely on can locate wholly we honor that bringing forth the words in ideas and a bra and a balance to the world again don't balance el Piloto on one side and unloved now watch this now say based on one side and unless you have you have what we would call the ministry didn't move locate look at yes a.m. I'll be steady you understand we go back to 325 AD when that spirit of Nicolay and began to move what do they do somewhere see it set up a Pope a holy man above everybody right push it rumba own hombres a necklace or at all so then through the years the influence of that little mule influence it has been great I still gonna do sir and that's why in a church but it's just Alicia you find pastors many times cincuenta pastors ministers many times in easter business i am the leader of the church yes really do what I say or you're gonna go to hell who stares hello can you do a selfie right now I want you to I want you to understand because it's real it happens but you know cantina pork is real these man is too so look at the people and shove him down so low they put in a hill I was pulling Tombaugh so that they can step on them and be greater but I can see pamper our soul a juicy sermon you see you you understand me if you been around you've been to another church of you you understand that they're gonna senegalese you see that with this when you get a Manson you do what I say well 15 who nobody can say okay I guess I'll look for you that's fine but make sure you're on the word oh it's time yeah so you have then then this this aura about the ministries many times I see the 13 Easter Easter when I talk I'm talking in general okay mr. Allen and so you have this that this the minister thinks that he is somebody so far greater than than the church I mean is rupees a case I got a grand mal to really listen then then he conquers the laity conquista like oh then the people in the church you gonna hit a legless yeah then they feel like their lesser and thinkest and so no then they look at the ministry and they say oh he's a great man oh is this Rambla Gandhi are you with me thank amigo but then after something happens to one of these men bitter asparagus to say again they saw somebody something happens or they fall or something might happen I mean it's like I know I go oh my goodness is it all but yeah now the problem with that or they'll preliminary cuz the laity has been conquered is perking like Oh Sofia cookies petals they hold the ministry to one standard material ministerio a lunesta dirty and they hold themselves to a lesser standard never lose the material and your room in order that's not that's not the church that Jesus came to build it's the noise they list yeah key cuz you never in a million years am I better or higher than you know communion your way in order to stay come on now we're we're restoring what belongs to the lady we're restoring them back to their rightful place it's double historically but it is the Lord just as you are just as much a son or daughter of God as I am say is tentacle Mooney Mooney hey my total for yo do you believe that today on Facebook I want the laity to be just as powerful as the minister get a little ankles at the ponies and in the church world healing Melinda glaze that's what I've been taken out is to look at Co capella and that's why the Holy Ghost can't move in the church the way it's supposed to settle all of a sudden I'm the deacon Gator pit video server I am to trust you then I tell you you're gonna Moriah the pastor pastor wait a minute you mean that's not the church that Jesus cares eglish the kicker's who believe upon this rock I will build my church and the gates of Hell cannot prevail against that no really Sarah but why because brother Bram says he's just as much God of the laity porque eres Putin told you there's a

the Holy Ghost came to do can experience up to you know said was make a church if we say we bring the church to perfection Italy gays your perfect you hurts that brother Brown says what a glaze equally matter I would rather see a church so full of love if you ever legally said Gina together full of gifts can i glitter you know they don't but if we could get a church fellowship where most of
