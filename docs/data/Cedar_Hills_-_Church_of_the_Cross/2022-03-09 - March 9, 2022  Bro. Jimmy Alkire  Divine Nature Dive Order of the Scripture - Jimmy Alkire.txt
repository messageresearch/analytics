church one more time i'm in this church [Music] [Applause] [Music] we're in such a glorious church something related to what i'm going to need to speak about in uganda and then the subtitle is the divine order of the scriptures you'd be so kind to open your bibles to your second peter marbles in secondary chapter 1 capital uno verses 1 through 6 how many of you have read this scripture what do you is what message this the prophet uses this scripture oh yeah that's the stature of a perfect man what a thing let's go ahead and read simon peter a servant an apostle of jesus christ to them that have obtained life precious faith with us to the righteousness of god and our savior jesus christ of christ grace and peace be unto be multiplied unto las cruces tabernacle alta vernaculo de las cruces is that the way you read it is it to you yes through the knowledge of god and of jesus our lord according as his divine power hath given up to us all things that pertain unto life and godliness through the knowledge of him that have called us to glory and virtue with allah amen and i still needed to stay back and yeah is this verse 4 okay it's right very well wherefore are given unto us exceeding great and precious promises that by these you might be partakers of the divine nature having escaped the corruption that is in the world through lust participated and beside this giving all diligence i like that and to knowledge temperance temperance patience to patient's godliness amen and i think we'll stop right there because i'm not going to really go into those details but let's go to our next scripture in first peter 1 verses 23 through 25 why don't we read this one together but when we when we say the first word being i want you to hold it just hold it just make it long you know so it might just anchor inside of you the plot will say you ready okay [Music] born again oh not of corruptable seed but of incorruptible by the word of god which liveth and abideth forever is all the glory of man has the flower of the grass with rest the flower faded away but the word of the lord endureth forever and this is the word which by the gospel is preached unto hello it never gets old lord where we prepare ourselves to be in your that you would make us more like you lord jesus christ we all together as the church of the living god is i'm gonna probably focus a little more tonight on what the new spirit actually is you're gonna like oh i'm sure you understand the words i'm referring to how you and i read the scriptures are we look at it like something is something that we don't have it's basically an external thing to us yes but we do not understand how it applies to us internally so i'm going to start with a few questions by a seed which is the living word of god a word that has not been touched by the intelligence of the carnal mind mess around with god's word because that changes the life of the scene there's many different things that we don't want to get into much [Music] is it out here is that or is it in here amen how many will say raise your hand that you're born again did you know that inside of that seed is everything you'll ever need in this journey inside of that seed is what will produce a man or a woman made in the image of god all the potential is inside of that scene there has to be a channel here's the one we really have a hard time who is the real you your true identity of who you are that you have been born christ christo one more time where is it christ christo this is abc you always believe christ is christ in you now in our divine order of the scriptures it's not that god has to to put it that way for himself but he put it in this order for you and me and that when we see ourself identified in god's word and we stay with god's plan nothing can stop us from being a manifested of why because we can't see what's on the inside so we separate everything and the way we judge everything everything is based on and that's why satan chose the head over the heart because he knew he could put man in this condition and as he attacks your mind with things that you can see taste film smell here he turns you into an external feature externa everything in the physical realm controls and this is where we're going to start getting into a new nature praise the lord jesus i know i'm speaking slow but i'm doing it on purpose the holy spirit wants you to get this el espiritu he doesn't only want you to get this he wants you to apply it amen let's continue an external creature that has no conscience of what is happening see when we read the scriptures we don't understand the divine order of god of how he will open and reveal the scriptures to us how he will open up the scriptures but our approach is from the outside to the inside god's approaches from the inside out is that emptiness remains permanency we just don't get it no no no it doesn't work there is no true change internally we i tried but it didn't work don't tell me you've never felt that way no sentiments you know what about almost a month ago three weeks ago my brother jerry de la preached and he went into institute but it says i will give unto you a new heart and put a new spirit in you spirit young people what does that mean significance or homelessness god's gonna put a new heart in me yes now when you are reborn you don't get a new speech you get a new nature spirit it is the same how does he change now i'm going to change the order of this little bit guys i want to go to the definition of the word nature amen now this might seem like a little bit of greek to you at first it may seem like a little bit of greek to europe you might not quite catch it just the way i believe the holy spirit will help you see it stick with it maybe it was my writing bro or thing but it it's hand thing all right this position will take you to the word composition what does that mean what makes you tick your makeup amen the way you work on the inside and out and the enemy knows that from the time you were born in this earth and you came into this world speaking lives even though you didn't want to lie okay a creative or controlling force in the universe what is that god this is divine in nature all the scientific world can call whatever they want said why if there was there's a great center how in the world do you think god created you bro you're wonderfully and beautifully made you the same way he made himself is so are you living in the world that you're creating well the truth is we are living in the world with work you've created the right world solo no es el mundo or oh the sum of such forces in an individual in an individual do you know what's in you instead [Music] but then i have to study the scripture and the message to see if that was the right spirit amen okay the fifth one i won't get into that one much because i might lose did you know the prophet says that the church is not an organization is an organization it's an organization an organism an organism has life within itself then through the sea but an organization an organization it's a system you try to keep a certain portion of god's word but closest to the door to the further parts of the word that need to be revealed let's go back to where we were at amen now brothers uh can you give me the next quote okay the greatest battle ever fought then what does that do from the middle of the heart which is the soul there it goes forth feeding every channel the trouble of it is the problem is we're standing in here with a lot of doubt trying to accept what's out here oh wait we can read the word we're trying to and satan's approach is also from the inside yeah well i thought he chose the oh now before we go to the definition of the word nature definition how many of you eagles what is praise the lord brothers can you put up the next one the interval amen this is in paragraph 60. he said after he gives us your new spirit especially that's you yes that's the nugget it's not the kernel of the nugget yet no es el centro now don't confuse that with god's spirit it's your new spirit so you can get along with the holy spirit you can't even get along with your wife m how are you ever going to get along with god he has to give you a new spirit or he can get along i gives you a new outlook there how can this new spirit be you como este no spiritu brother sammy where did that spirit come from who created that spirit now it's going to get a little crazy genesis 1 26 we're not going to turn to it where god said let us make man in our image and in our life what kind of a man and he marks that spirit marcus espirito was the generic code of the let us the agamos not let me does your spirit say does your spirit say let us agamus make me is it still saying the same thing in our image isn't that what god's doing here god never stopped making men to me but i mean that shows me that that spirit that was created there god knew i was gonna fall down he knew his plan of redemption that he had laid out before the foundation of the world that it would never fail he also but through the plan of redemption this spirit that we have he created there and it's been restored back to the discussion my where were you when i laid the foundations of the earth fundamentally ask yourself that question verses thank you where was that when i laid the foundations of the earth declare if you have thou has understanding don't establish intelligence imagine god tells jobs you stand up like a man i'm gonna speak to you and this world then comes down who have laid the measurements thereof [Music] whereupon are the foundations they're all fastened and who laid their quarters though there's [Music] i'm going to read it amen you're going to remember tonight but my whole goal is for you to remember before before there was a foundation of the world before there was them angels and everything was happy was to bring me from the spirit oh brother seed oh my gosh he knew he was going to turn on him he didn't waste no time he laid out his plan retention is not something new [Music] that god's plan will produce actually it's right what he said but you go look up that word water spout video of what a water spot was located it's a tornado that goes off the shore into the ocean and it's making a and when it noise to the top because it sprays up the water in a circle as far as it has pressure to throw it out that's in that space he can stay in this area he's gonna get saturated anybody in that space with the holy ghost with the water it's not just one little why the really the original spirit of who you are before the world ever began let's the divine order of the scriptures amen simon peter a servant an apostle of jesus christ with them and have obtained like precious faith with us through the righteousness of god and our savior jesus christ that the only way to build this that you're the perfect man these people here is the pueblo same like precious space amen amen and he was going to build on that uh is you're not going to get this from the office of the sun no you gotta but i'm telling you peter pedro you got a glimpse beforehand do you know why peter pedro but now jesus has returned to the office of the father jesus and now we get this revelation from that eternal spirit is this a spirit to eternal nature and it's what he's building his church on yes that's why there's no message like this message takes us back to the foundation of apostles prophets i want you to notice something let's go back to that scripture again in a second peter right on 45 46 i'm going to try to stay to 50 if i can let's go down to verse three please if you can here we go according as his divine power had given unto us all things that pertain to life and god he doesn't identify what it is no identification because there are things that he put in man that this divine power has to bring out access to all of these things let's go to verse 4 same scripture thank you whereby are given unto us exceeding greats igrandissimus and precious promises but why would we need these great and precious promises if by this divine power he gave us all things because by these great and exceedingly great promises he would put into action you open it in action the divine power of god el porter divided to bring these things amen that by these you might be partakers of the divine nature having escaped the corruption of the world through last year wow next verse verse 5 versus amen and beside this giving all diligence add to the like precious faith did you catch it add to your faith becomes your faith it was not this great like precious faith the great light precious where is that new spirit spirit it's on the inside of you what's it connected to the soul where the sea germ is and that new spirit is the channel and remain forever and my 50 minutes is up let's have a word of press stand our feet how to use this new spirit or let this new spirit be renewed in you come on instead until what's on the inside charities stand up charlie and be known and i say the same thing to you
