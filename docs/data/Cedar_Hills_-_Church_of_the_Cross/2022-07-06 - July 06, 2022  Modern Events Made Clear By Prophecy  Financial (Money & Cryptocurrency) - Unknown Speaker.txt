presence or that we can come before you lord and just surrender ourselves to you lord the lord just let your word be displayed in our midst and take over that we may hear from you we give you all honor praise gloria his name we ask jesus amen you may be seated amen tonight we're going to talk about financing finances and so i don't know if you recognize but i brought some financial advisors with us okay are you guys ready estan listos hey man can we just get comfortable tonight open up our hearts that the lord could show us and there's still light here for us i want to start off with the scripture book of amos chapter 3. very familiar scripture and it reads like this surely the lord god will do nothing but he revealeth his secret unto his servants the prophets and verse eight the lion hath roared who will not fear the lord god has spoken who can but prophesy now let us go to galatians chapter 5 verse 1. and it reads like this stand fast therefore in the liberty wherewith christ have made us free and be not entangled again with the yoke of bondage ah mama that personal feelings many times we look at the chaos of this world and we forget about all that the prophet has left in our hands and many times you know don't misunderstand when we talk about the fear normally the scripture says who can but fear you know but it's because when the word of the prophet comes forth the fear that we need and we began to talk about these subjects if we do not get the biggest part that the prophet left us amen so i want to turn it over to brother carlos and you know carlos and we're going to take it slow tonight so i'm going to ask you for one thing if there's someone here that may not understand something just raise your hand and just as your school teacher would say there's no dumb question come on so i i uh i laughed because a minute ago because the scripture brother ben read i didn't know the scripture that he was going to read i hadn't read it so of course it's it's you're always in amazement how the holy spirit works but what i want to talk about a little bit tonight and and myself and brother seth kind of have have a lot of maybe some of some of the same information [Music] in regards to to this topic because it's it's uh you know galatians 5 1 right and then you have the bonus right when i think of bonds it's like there's not a no bigger bond or a yoke of bondage than being in financial debt no i must remember the money they started is that in the adult so what i want to kind of talk about today is is bonds and just real briefly you know kind of kind of kind of understand what they are because of course brother branham brother brown talks about how that that that rome has the goal yeah and then and then he mentions that the jews have the bonds and we understand we understand the significance of gold in both the natural and the spiritual significance the in the natural obviously it's a precious metal um i believe the last time i looked it was at like 1300 an ounce but but and of course in the spiritual gold gold is is the spiritual is it's deity right right okay so so we have we have the the natural we have the spiritual aspect of it but we don't we don't we don't hear a lot about the bonds and what role the the bonds play equals and what it means to us so basically a bond is is can be thought of like an iou um and it is what a country like ours uses to finance our the united states abandoned the gold standard right okay so what what what is what was the gold standard well the gold standard basically was simply explained like this if an ounce of gold cost five hundred dollars then every one dollar bill was worth there was a fundamental shift in our country and and most people don't understand how significant the shift was because we we abandoned the gold standard in the natural financially but we also abandoned the deity of jesus christ okay so so when this fundamental shift happens in in the united states we adopt a system called the the fiat money system and and basically what that means significa is we can make money as much money as we want we can print it all day and there is only one thing that makes that money worth anything and that is debt yes so when we print money we have to create debt to make that money worth anything so we decided as a country that we were to give up our money having actual value in favor of our money being worth how much debt we could get into infor so who would actually benefit from this debt beneficiary so the debt does two things the debt the first thing that it does is it produces cash flow for our country so when you hear on on cnn that they're they're trying to to propose a new budget it's because our country has created a whole bunch of ious acreal muchos and we sell them to whoever will buy them we sell our worth bender we sell the very heart of our country every single year cut that on you to to finance the operation of the country para financier operation so when i say that we had a fundamental shift in 1971 radically as a country at the government level and at the individual level individual changed the way that we handle money gambia and we moved out of god's economy in and that's what in this world that's the way it's set up i mean think of it as a young kid the schools are pushing you to get an occupation something that you could you know fall in love with depending on the class you're part of depending uh as far as lower middle classes and this this is a recurring thing to achieve anything in this life brother branham talks about the rich merchants of this world and it's no coincidence why they set it up this way right because for you to get the american dream it is beautiful right now everybody wants the american who wants the american dream and you're probably you're living it right now you know other people looking at out outside in this is a wonderful opportunity but it's the way the system that we think already in our mind that we bought something but we're going to spend a lifetime paying it off and what they'll do is you sign a contract location you guys know about questions sign this contract and if you don't pay the student loans back they'll actually call your boss how much more how the bible talks about you can't [Music] and that's the biggest slavery and bondage that there is when work actually becomes more time than the time you actually give god our whole lives are dedicated to that and that's just that doesn't even include if you get credit cards because then you get credit cards to get the things that you want you know what i find so the amount of money they spent in credit card advertising i mean you go to the mailbox and most of the mail is an application to apply for a new credit card yes and what they want to do is that you have three credit cards why don't you apply for this credit card because you have great credit and you're an awesome bill [Music] you are a good servant brother carlos you need more bills so that that's that's how our country is that's how we as a nation is how does this how does this pertain to us as the bride of jesus christ go ahead brother ben so what you're saying is we become in bondage to somebody i decided to do it as a nation to the rest of the world and then as individuals individuals we become in bondage to the larger corporations so then when we go down there how vulnerable does it make us let's start off with comments then we'll talk about the spiritual aspect so where does that put us vulnerable as a nation when we go down this road that you said we just so as a nation what it does to us is it effectively gives the rest of the it turns the rest of the world so who loves the land of the three we're the land of the in debt you see what's going on and we kind of go back to the oil situation that's going on right now it's because when they don't produce more oil we have to fly our president over there and he has to beg for more oil so that's what it does to us in terms of vulnerability as a nation so refresh their minds what you said in the last week right now who holds our bonds so there's three of all the people that own our bonds there's three major there's two major countries and one major organization that holds our bonds superior china holds 117 trillion dollars worth of arbonne japan japon 113 trillion opec holds 268 billion dollars worth of our debt dossiers there's 13 countries the biggest one of them all saudi arabia arabia and they hold yeah just so back to the back to the thing that we talked about the last time and the secret deal that was struck it's really saudi arabia that has the 268 billion dollars of our debt i wanted him to paint a picture for you guys and then we see where we're at right now so this paints and you could start seeing as we get to the end of this panel where we're going to end up amen so brother seth you can take it from here so i find you you can imagine something about the oil right last time the democrats democrats being persuaded or influenced right me telling me about it uh to go electric and how they're trying to discredit the oil right right or petroleum it used to be antecedent that the gold quelloro was the most important valuable and that countries would actually have wars i understood this and i know many questions are out there because you know we know what the prophet says so why wouldn't we just start digging for more gold with the debt standard as opposed to the gold standard it is and to keep up with the joneses and the trips to disneyland is a disneyland not that it's wrong no question but when we start living above our means and we lose christian stewardship and we get away from god's economy in favor of doing these things they call it the rat race and you're a mouse in that wheel that just goes like this and voluntarily they've created a system that we will willingly give up our rights give up our privileges as christians and sell that even for 30 pieces of silver so so we talk about let's talk about the spiritual aspect of spiritual before brother seth gets into we look at the spiritual aspect of spiritual we can show how we're in bondage right and how it takes full control of us as many that grew up in this church i remember stories asteroids i remember real live stuff when a brother wanted to watch tv television he would go to the video store ran a tv and a vcr television to the opposite point where we're completely relaxed about it and as we heard last wednesday we become completely relaxed and what what's what's crazy is that okay as we talk about this you know we have robbed from god god's economy is not the way the world's economy is the world's economy they want to put you in debt in an economy a pretty picture hey i'm gonna have money for a house you're gonna pay me more than what you that price is used but yeah we see here's christ i'm freely going to give you yeah pay off your debt what it really took for him to give his only begotten son you know you you see that that that in this yes he did it willingly gave his life willingly to nowadays you can't loan a person a dollar because because you know i might not get it back but yet christ asks you for nothing back but your heart. carlos everything else every demon in hell ever has control of the country's heart he lives here so so today we see that inflation costs it's a big deal in the country that they they say it's nine percent we know by the math it's it's upwards of 30 percent so in these inflation costs how how uh how did these inflation costs get like how do they get to explode out of nowhere so to understand inflation you have to understand economics in the most basic sense economics is simply supply versus demand economies that's all it really is there's a whole bunch of science behind it but it's supply versus demand when supply is really high and demand is really low that's where you see all the cool sales that you walk into and everything's on sale it's fire sale for everything when demand is really high and supply is really low that's where you find inflation because everybody needs to or wants to charge more for the product for the product then what it's worth right they're going to charge more bananas there's not enough noise so what does that make the what happens to the value of the dollar then exactly so so when your dollar five years ago you'd walk into walmart with a hundred dollars and walk out with a basket full of groceries right you get the little one that did you carry on your arm about that big car because they're charging for the bat the bag too right now right now they're charging for the bag because hey that's like 10 cents but did you notice in some countries can algonos that were depending on the us dollars they're totally wiped out yes and so we do understand the realization of cryptocurrency these days that these countries are actually looking to adopt as their nation's currencies because it's cryptocurrency but it is a cryptocurrency the government doesn't have control of it yet people are fighting for that control because if they can control it you can be their so that's where it gets into so this cryptocurrency is crypto you see that it was the ability to send money so i don't know some of you might might know or not know but how many have an iphone one telephone okay so if you have an iphone you can lose an iphone you can use apple pay very common right we can say i forgot your birthday card send you 20 bucks later right boom instantly it's there but in this you see how they're they they talk a lot about the chip in the hand and all this stuff that they want to say it's a chip okay get in the citizenship the craziest setup is that it's a digital wallet that you already possess in your own pocket right now it has control over your your identity control over your finances control of your gift card when we went to uganda we we had to wonder why we had to apply and put all of our all of our uh all of our shot records and everything on an app in an application they also can have complete control okay use some important things from one second to the next is we see that the gold had it got value because everybody loved it right it was shiny and all this stuff but now it all down now they they they call value in your digital stuff but how much screen time is so which creates these digital block chains this is this is get all of your information because of the heat it even plays on the economy in the sense of i tried this the other day i like to hunt and so i started talking a lot wait did you go to the metaverse i started messing around like you know i really would love to buy me a new rifle it's the weirdest thing all of a sudden you can go to your google search the first thing that pulls up hunting christians in arms are you kidding me has anybody ever noticed that if you're having a conversation all of the sudden there's a smartphone when you open it up there's an ad for that thing coolest thing is though you can get it financed i can't afford not to get it that's right well that's how it gets me without it everything that it gets you and it ties you to every little thing you like to watch on your smartphone everything that you search everything it all links right back to you through this digital name but it's not because of how awesome you are it's because how long you spend on that screen is how many ads they can expose you to get onto someone so how do we get our search engine in our minds is but we don't realize then our kids are already growing up so we've gone through these stages as each one of our youth is going through right now so how do we do the same thing in the spiritual aspect of it that every different thought would be a thought of god okay so i think it goes back to what our pastor how do we live in the realm that brother branham was in equality that realm of the holy spirit where you're in constant contact with him in genesis it tells you in genesis god created the heaven and the earth in these in in these six days what's crazy is that he literally took nine months though each and every one of us that way we all could have what we need in six days each and every one of us had nine months right but yet we don't rely on that no no that's what was yeah that's why the bible tells us we we receive our salvation through what this human's root spirit trembling okay immortal you know and you go to paul you say he said i sin daily we go we're human beings god made this and made us a certain way that we got this little roller coaster that we have if we never went to the lowest parts of our life then we wouldn't appreciate when he brings us to the highest part you know so we gotta look at our struggles as our character that's being built so that we're always in an expectation to receive from him you know but if we do not focus our mind on him we're going to focus it on the bad things because god because satan knows each one of our weak spots because if not and we're going to end up like our prophet said the nation would end up but busted and bankrupt that's right because that that's the meat and potatoes what we want to get to tonight you know we we want to see what the end result that that the prophet talked about how that this nation had to be bankrupt comes are you done so going back to where the gold's at if they can prove to you that you don't really like gold or it has no value to you yeah let's start doing something more electronic electronica and at the end of the day all the rich merchants dolos mercadias and everyone that's been paying all their debts up he closed but only when it's too late and it's already in the hands of rome the roma right so that there's a statistic that it shows that america has the largest federal reserve there's also other statistics that say the vatican vaticano has 20 million dollars in the federal reserve is in pueblito there's not always a walmart no walmart nope there's always a catholic church in every little town if you drive down from asia manigault is the government taking your money and they are still taking out your money i got a quote i want to read and only okay this is this is brother tommy okay in in cur the message is current events part one inside oh okay okay but current event but uh this is this is our founding pastor in 1993 he says now this beast okay he says has what it's called the gold the jews have the bonds this beast is the bonds so he doesn't just want the gold he wants the bonds but he won't get it by himself this is 1993 but he won't get it by himself he will go to where the prophet was born and in the midst of where the prophet was born is called egyptian which is the center is the great pyramid in the center of the earth everybody see that there it is everybody see that right there that was two years ago that man that the pope is shaking hands with he is the leader of all of the sunni muslims in the world in egypt that's him this is it brother tommy in 1993 is prophesying what's going to happen so so why is that significant because he's part of the bonds he's part of one of the countries in opec that hold the bonds the majority of all of the countries that are in opec the 13 countries are muslim so it's a mass it's it's a major thing and that's what it taught me in 1993 so you when this unravels okay so you just try to look at it from afar you know these arab countries of opec okay it says they have our bonds they have a good portion of our bodies right so they have a lot of control hey mucho we wanted to go crazy and go after them that's right but they put on we had to put the brakes on he said remember record we got your bonds so so just a theoretical question we know what the prophet says he just looked at his how is rome going to go and take or even buy the bonds from opec the control that they have over the united states is worth more money than those bonds are worth so how is it going to be given up you know okay let's go back to the seventh or the six day war this is how bad the war is over there against israel israel the arab countries russia sends that fake signal out russia mother and that's why they end up saying it was six days six days of miracles you know so you start seeing you start seeing this the level commences and you start seeing how here comes here's going to come rome akiba roma so so when they go to get the balls this is just me now you know we've dug into this i know we've been digging into the the north and the south established and you look you stand up you say that's got to be his leverage point is and with that agreement it takes the bonds so you you can see how that how that starts unfolding which starts to take us to and all you got is a piece of paper you know because that's what the prophet of god tells us you know you want to read this brother brother omar this this is the meat and potatoes this is uh the i think that's the first sale and i just want you to listen to this part just because brother brown breaks it down step by step when we're talking about the financial part of rome and the jews will make a covenant with one another off the taxes for 40 years from now where are we at estamos plus there is only one thing can happen that's to call in the currency and pay off the bonds wall street owns them wall street is esto and wall street is controlled by the jews the rest of it is in the vatican and the jews have got the rest of it in wall street and wall street with the commerce of the world commercial we can't call it and then there's only one thing to do the catholic church can pay it off she is the only one who has got the money yes and she can't do it i'm sorry and she can do it and she will do it and in in doing this in a certain store to get it she'll compromise with the jews to make a covenant and when she makes this covenant with the jews now remember i'm talk i'm i'm taking this from the scripture and now when she does this makes this covenant we notice in daniel 8 23. uh as soon as he gets the thing wrapped up and gets the money of the jews tied up and when he does that oh my my o and in the midst of this three and a half years and he breaks the covenant as soon as he gets this thing wrapped up he gets the money of the jews tied up and when he does that oh my god he has called the antichrist until the end of the church for he is is he that i'm sorry and and has the children are against are against christ and the word is this man is called the antichrist now now he is going to hold the money and that's where i think it will come in uh and will be called the antichrist in the sight of god until the end time now but then he will be called something else now when he gets the money all under control then he'll break his covenant with the jews as daniel here said he would do it come on [Music] because he'll hold the wealth of the world completely economy and during that time them two prophets will arise on the scene yes and that's good right there but i wanted him to get to that last part we look at it just as the united states but she takes which rome takes it full control of every place that there's any type of the bride of christ there and that's where it gets nasty so yeah so you say okay we look at it and it's it's during that those three and a half years so don't forget there's that lap over no no when we look at it we may not completely be gone when when all that's happening there's parts that we may be here when we make because we talk about that and we may see part of it don't think oh we're free and clear when that happens no no physical no no why why then is is rome so interested in in the us first i mean why doesn't why doesn't she go after i don't know south america okay but nobody tells america why doesn't she go after uh i don't know some some other country i think where the carlos is because most of the countries rely on us we lead the world what happens here look at contest trickles down into the rest of the world and there's there's a num there's all kinds of and everywhere everybody's got an idea right what the mark of the beast is i mean obviously we know our prophet clarified what the mark of the beast is right it's apostasy right but in terms of in terms of of the financial thing because that's right how does that get how does that happen so again this is me one of the things that bonds do uh if your interest rate is 60 on a credit so that then that's just me yes this is you it's me that's what it is that's just me somebody else have any anything you want to add to that i think that kind of just real quick that leads into this is one world currency maybe that happens exactly the way you're talking about it i believe they call it like the blessed cryptocurrency it is a crypto and that they were aiming to be the one of the first you want to say los primeros nations to actually as a government to use this because they have their own bank right but it's of course right they have they have their own bank right they have the gold standard so they have what so in in accounting brother caleb knows this anybody is accounting you have what you call an asset and a liability ideally to be wealthy so does anybody have anything else to add to that i was just going to say in all of this it kind of makes you feel doom and gloom it and my god shall supply my all of your needs hold on hold hold on hold on can you read that again and my god immediately of your needs one more time and my god shall supply all your needs all of my needs this means necessity and my god shall supply all your needs i'm sorry thank you pastor and all your need necessity according to his riches conformed in glory in gloria i i just want you to know paul when he writes this pablo paul endured great times for the edifying of the body of christ i just want you to know something we are not forgotten because one glorious day our prophet told us [Applause] amen our god is good tonight let's get some microphones up here brother will god rides on the water [Applause] [Music] i know that god is god and jesus is his name he was god when jesus walked the shores of galilee he's not in brothers now he's god in you and me i know that god is he rides on the flood [Music] there ain't no power in there him all the praise god is in control i give him all the praise for god is in control give him all the praise god is in control turn it around turn it foreign [Music] oh [Music] oh god we'll make it good turn it around turn it [Music] those [Applause] god right do you love him church can you just raise
