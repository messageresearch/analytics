it's a blessing to be here Worship the Lord and honor his resurrection surrounded by Believers of hi Catherine God bless you God bless you and um where you're standing if you'd open up your scriptures going to read in Genesis CH 1: 26 and 27 and then after that we'll read Luke 17263 and God said let us make man in our image after our likeness and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea and over the foul of the earth and over the cattle and over all the Earth and over every creeping thing that creepeth on so God created man in his own image in the image of God created he him male and female created them in Luke 17 says and as it was in the days of Noah so shall it also be in the days of the son of man they did eat they drank they married wives they were given in marriage until the day that Noah entered into the ark and the flood came and destroyed them all likewise also as it was in the days of lot they they did eat they drank they bought they sold they planted they build it but the same day that lot went out of Sodom it rained fire and brimstone from heaven and destroyed them all even thus shall it be in the days when the son of man is revealed Lord Jesus Place ourselves completely under your control may you control every aspect of our being body and father may you till our hearts may your word come and be planted in good soil may your Holy Spirit Quicken the word in our heart you answer the questions that we have we surrender ourselves completely to your Divine will and purpose in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ pray amen amen you may be seated um I'm uh for those that don't know you my name is I mean not those that don't know you yeah for those that don't know you also those that don't know me Bern Garcia jcia j and uh I'm in public announce I'm going to make a pack with my interpreter I usually do this in the privacy of our room but I forgot to uh it might be a little bit different for you interpreting me but uh I like to take turns talking which means I'm GNA wait for you so you can wait for me uh when we're both talking at the same time sometimes it's hard for the monolingual speakers to understand what's being said those of us that speak bilingual we can pretty much understand because we get the first half of the first Minister and then the second half of the interpreter but those who only speak one language only get the first half of or the last half of depending what language they so um if I do get carried away all you have to do is give me the look and I'll understand that I'm breaking my pack um today we're going to just a little thought the son of man revealed so we have the the tense on the on the on the board is a little is a little uh wrong I I was probably slurring when I told him my title but it should end with an ed revealed not reveal it now the son of man ralth yeah that that is an important thought we're not going to try to get into that today just the son of man revealed now when we think of the son of man being revealed it conjures up in my mind anyways in my imagination uh some images of something awesome taking place in the last days in the culmination of the time when it's all coming to a climax the days when the son of man is revealed and so in our minds this must be some great momentous thing and it's it's as simple as uh honey can you stand up for a minute this is my wife letia who's accompanying see it's it's that simple she was hidden from your Viewpoint even though she was right in front of you the whole time and yet yet when she is announced and stands up and then all your attention turns that way then you can see when uh the son of man is revealed remember it's it's something that is hidden but is not going to be revealed or uncovered or exposed to view now when I was a kid my great dream was to be a ninja I wanted to be able to sneak into people's houses and assassinate them without them knowing I was even there I don't know if any of you have ever had that desire but I did I'll admit it I even had a couple of victims picked out so when the Lord saved me and changed my heart my desire to become a ninja went away it was no longer compatible with who I was but I got to admit that one aspect of being ninja still stuck with me and it never went away and that was the art of invisibility see the Ninja can be invisible in a crowd of people and it's not that he turns invisible but he's mastered the art of fitting in of looking like everybody else and and you can't see him you can't find him and that's how God is many times see he hides himself in the simplest but then he reveals himself in that very same simple thing in which he was hiding so we're we're not going to go very long today I I can already tell we're not going very long so I'm going War my son you might want to get a couple of songs ready in your mind to help me out towards the end so when I think of the son of man being revealed everywhere I go all the M churches rather because if I ask a denominational member they had no idea what what to say I said what is the son of man and right away everybody will say prophets Ministry of the prophet and and that is true that the son of man is a prophet but when you when you start to look at how see to me the a prophet is this great being it's it's the mouthpiece of God it's the voice of God for his generation it's the the son of man the prophet going to be revealed and uh what we understand that brother Branham being the prophet to the last Church age the seventh angel messenger the holder the seventh seal that in the last days all the Mysteries that had been hidden and broken up and loose end that were everywhere when this great seventh angel this star this messenger this Prophet the messenger or prophet of the seventh seal when he would begin to sound the trumpet the mysteries of God would be revealed and if the mysteries of God would be revealed that would include the revealing of the son of man and that he would do the same things that God did in the past the same thing he did in the days of lot which was to discern the hearts of the people to foretell the things that was going to happen those things would happen again in the days of which the son of a man would be revealed now sometimes when I go to a place and uh I've been wanting to go there right like Egypt for example I always wanted to see the p pyramids of Egypt in my mind it would be something incomparable one of the eight Wonders of the World it would be amazing and then one day quite unexpectedly I got the opportunity to go to the pyramids and as I stood there and looked up at the pyramids it's a bunch of rocks in the desert yeah they're they're piled up on each other but it didn't come close to matching up with what I thought it would be like and uh I looked closely at the Rocks saw how big they were and I did have to kind of wonder how they lifted those rocks so high but all in all just being there and looking at it it didn't right really seem like a big deal see to the Casual Observer you probably don't look like such a big deal either but when you begin to to Really delve beyond the outer layer of the pyramid and to study what's on the inside the interior of the pyramid and the technology of of how it was created and the possible functions it may have had I mean it could have been anything from a big giant water pump that would irrigated the land it could have been an energy source of some subtle electrical currents that we still do not understand even though we're starting to scratch the surface of them something about it is profound now you there's something about you that is profound and it's it's it's so profound that even you yourself are baffled by yourself why can't I just be happy why do I do the things I don't want to do and why why do I do the things I don't want to do why am I from here and there why does nobody understand me am what's my purpose here on Earth me and we we look for our answers mostly outside of ourselves that's why we will turn to alcohol or drugs or money or to a career popularity we think that there's something outside of us that we're lacking it leaves us in a state of confusion when when we are young and still closer to the Creator if I could say it that way we're filled with wonder we hear the stories of God from our parents and we Marvel it doesn't take a struggle for us to understand God is real heaven exists hell exists right and wrong is black and white the Catholic priest Jesuit priest say if we can get the child before he's seven if we can get the child before he turns seven they'll never leave the church because they can indoctrinate them and instill in them I remember we got a call from our our son's teacher one day a boy was in kindergarten and she said I want to let you know that today your son gave his heart to Jesus Christ in the classroom I said what do you mean what happened he said he looked so sad and depressed and I said Daniel what what's what's the matter are you okay she said no teacher he said no teacher I'm not okay I have come to realize that my heart is full of Darkness and she said and so I told him you know Jesus can take away your heart of darkness and put light in there don't you he said how he said just ask him invite him into your heart tell him to fill you with his light he said after about 30 40 seconds his face lit up he got a a great smile he looked at her there were tears in his eyes he said teacher Jesus came and he filled my heart with flight and you know we wonder sometimes as adults or maybe we start to pay attention as teenagers and we we we understand we need to change we need to do something we want to serve God and somehow we've complicated it so much but it seems like a simple prayer Lord Jesus I give you my heart today take the darkness out come into my life and fill me with your light It seems impossible that such a simple prayer like that could transform your life but let me tell you this morning if you can believe the simple Faith like a child and make a sincere prayer to God it doesn't take a lot of jumping and shouting that's not required to receive his life when you receive his life then you let him jump and Shout inside of you you don't have to manufacture anything you don't have to fit into a certain type of crowd you don't even have to believe a word that I'm saying you have to believe your own word Lord Jesus I give you my heart today my heart is full of Darkness would you come in take away this Heart of Mine give me a heart of Flesh put your life inside of me if you can believe your words as you pray a prayer like that or whatever prayer that you can believe in that acknowledges the presence of God that acknowledges your state of sin that confesses your need for him it can be long it can be short it doesn't matter what matters is that your soul makes a connection with almighty God what makes that connection a humble and contrite spirit the Lord will never reject he will not despise him if a man will say in his heart I have did the things of the world I have tried the worldly way I have done wrong and it didn't profit me anything amen if you would just admit that God would be faithful ful to save him and rescue him from the pits of hell why what does that do it reveals the son of man see it it's not a complicated thing to reveal the son of man it's a simple thing to reveal the son of man let's let's uh let's read a few a few quotes here and God identify by characteristics in 1964 Jesus said in Luke the 17th chapter when in the last days God in some dry times speaking by the prophets in the last days by his son now watch he said in the time when the son of man is being revealed this setting of Sodom will return again as it was in the days of Sodom so shall it be at the coming of the son of man when he is being revealed made known to the church to the elect not to Sodom or the sodomites or the ones down in Sodom to the elected Abraham was the elected and the Royal Seed of Abraham is the Believers so who is the son of man being revealed to he elected Abraham and his Royal seed the Believers through Christ Jesus the word and is the elected let me read that again and the Royal Seed of Abraham is the Believers through Jesus Christ the word and is the elected are you Believers this day then you through the Lord Jesus Christ you are the Royal Seed of Abraham and when the son of man is being revealed that setting would be again okay in Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever 52 August the 1 while you're getting your things ready I want to ask you something in Hebrews 1 138 the Bible said that Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever do you believe that's inspired amen I believe that is the truth that at the Judgment day that God will see that that is the truth Hallelujah read that a little slower I believe that is the truth this is Brother Brown saying I believe that is the truth that at the Judgment day that God will see that it is the truth don't you believe it all right yes and now let's just wonder what type of a person Jesus was remember he's the same yesterday today and forever now I know we have some theological ideas and some painters have painted pictures but let's not look at him in the picture form tonight because we may not know but let's look at him in his life his spirit so Jesus when he comes back to Earth again in his body form it'll be too late then for us to think anything about it right so so let's think about it now when he comes back in his body form like the angel said this same Jesus that you see ascending this same Jesus will return when we see that body come back it'll be too late to start wondering what type of person he was now we're going with him then those that are ready how many want to be ready on that when he comes amen we want we want to be ready what does it mean to be ready it means we're not confused any longer we're not wondering about ourselves any longer I can't tell you how many years I suffered under the thought am I part of the Bride or the foolish virgin we don't wonder anymore because when the son of man is revealed something breaks apart in US there's no room for doubt anymore there's no wondering our position in Christ anymore there's no wondering who we are anymore because the revealing of the Son of Man reveals all those things to us the mysteries of God become known brother Garcia I've been in the message 30 years and I and I still have confusion I still don't understand what's going to happen that's okay all things are possible to he that understands oh I see I got some Bible readers here all things are possible to he that believes amen amen you believe how can you believe unless you know for an assur that something is true even though you can't see it even though you can't he hear it even though you can't feel it I was telling brother Tommy Jr yesterday Tommy j i I was at a point in my life that I did not believe in the resurrection I did not believe in afterlife and I was I was I was in depression because my son had just died and I looked at the scriptures and I said this is just a story brother Garcia really after so many years of serving God after so many years of preaching sometimes we enter in what is called an existential crisis where we don't believe in anything existing because we lost track we fall into a spiritual Amnesia we forget who we are we forget what our lives were before God came into our Liv we forget the the things that God has done for us that's why it's important to keep the testimonies alive that's why we read about David that's why the stories of Saul were written down so that we could know that we're human we are human still but I I kept on fighting this thought and I began to tell myself you might not be able to see that the word is true you might not be able to see that there is a resurrection you might not be able to believe in in an afterlife but the word of God is true God cannot lie you cannot deny the existence of a God because my focus up to then had always been as brother brandham said in one of his messages I don't know if I'm going to make it to heaven but if God was sending me to hell I'll still worship him there in hell out of gratitude for what he has done for me in my [Applause] life so I never looked at Heaven as a goal to reach I was appreciated of what God had done in my life I don't claim to know everything or the Mysteries or what thought but I do know that one day I was lost in sin and I gave my heart to Jesus Christ and he reached down his hand and he saved my soul and gave me a portion of his holy ghost and no matter how dark my life gets and how lost I am how much Satan is passing me through and fro how much I'm ready to give up it always seems like he makes the Fatal mistake and he mocks me and he tries to say and that day that you think you were born again was just an emotional fantasy oh he hits against that steak that anchor to which I'm anchored that exp spirit that nobody can take away I said hold it there oh you might tell me I'm not worthy you might tell me I'm a loser you might even tell me I'm an unbeliever but you can't never tell me that on that day I received a new [Music] birth that I was seed to be I became a new creature what happened the son of man had been revealed hallu what is a revealing it's an unmasking it's an unveiling it's exposing to the public what has been hidden and let me tell you something when the son of man is unveiled or revealed it doesn't need a public showing it's for an audience of one you are that audience and you see the son of man revealed in your life in your heartu so Jesus when he comes back to Earth again in his body form it'll be way too late then for us to think anything about it you believe that we're going with him then those that are ready okay so we're going to read this really slow so you can really catch this so now when we see him in body formu no matter whether he's a white man a yellow man or black man or brown man whatever he is he's my [Applause] savior you know the scripture says if you see your brother ER you go you talk to him and you turn his ways back to the Lord know assuredly you have rescued him and save a soul Who's your Sav yeah I I know it's Jesus he paid the price but who talked to you what color was the skin of the man Hallelujah LED you to the feet of Jesus [Applause] Christ hallelujah hallelujah what does the son of man do he does the works of the Son of God it was the son of God standing on Earth who said to his disciples who do men say that I the son of man he was the son of God in human form the son of man and he said why do you get upset that I say I'm the son of God did not your teachers call them whom the word of God came to Gods when you think of the son of man and you think of a prophet because the son of man is a prophet it's who the son who the word of God has come to cuz the word of God always comes to the prophet to the son of man what are you saying brother Garcia are you trying to say you're a prophet I'm more than a prophet that's right in this generation I wasn't called to hide in a COR of the battle raised around me fear had its grip on my throat and I fell into such a spirit of bondage of fear and I couldn't think of what to do I couldn't escape I called my buddy Tom Tom and he said Bernie Bernie listen to the service on Wednesday and I listened to the service on Wednesday and I heard Pastor Caleb saying you were chosen for this day for this age just take up the sword of faith and slay the enemy oh hallelujah hallelujah why are we hiding in the trenches when the enemy lies before us take up your sword cut left and right the enemy that's what we were called for light came out of Heaven ENT turned to my heart and the fear went away the doubt went away and discouragement went away everything went away I was left with peace and Assurance not that everything will be okay no that I could die on the battlefield in honor and Glory and God would be my eternal reward what can this world give us what can we fear of lost nothing we're not of this world how do you know because the Son of Man reveals is revealed no what what is this this son of man whatever he is brother Ram says whatever he is he's my savior little man a fat man Thin Man He's My Savior see I love him I love him so much I love him with all oh my don't you just remember those times when you lay in the throws of defeat somehow you dragged yourself to the Church of God and maybe some L on nobody came up and preached the word of God and something stuck your heart and delivered you to to we never forget those moments we can't forget the ringing of those words in our [Applause] heart God didn't put us here to be a bunch of cowards he put us here because he knew we could overcome the forces of Darkness why are you jealous of Moses and Daniel and Israel and Isaac why do you wish you lived in their days oh what a great hero you would have been greater is the battle today than they ever faced when we get to heaven we'll go up to want to hear their testimonies and they'll tell us no no no first you tell me how did you overcome that 21st century oh because the son of man [Applause] revealed he says I love him with all my heart and now he but what he was it wasn't so much as the flesh but the flesh is wonderful it was virgin born you believe that I believe that almighty God overshadowed the Virgin Mary and created a blood cell in the womb of Mary my God he says bful sometimes it wasn't so much as the flesh but the flesh was wonderful it was virgin born you see that separation between you and Jesus Christ we've made it a great golf we've made it an a barrier that we can't overcome see we can't really be like Jesus because he was virgin born we were born in the body of sin and flesh but what he was it wasn't so much as the flesh but the flesh was wonderful it was virgin born I believe that God Almighty overshadowed the Virgin Mary and created a blood cell in the womb of Mary but he's basically saying that's not the great thing that that's not what he was then he goes and talks about the German life and how it came and how it was virgin born and the argument he had with a man great story by the way you you want to read it it's wonderful man he says he was a great person her son Hallelujah it was a great person literally conforming the son person are you a person you're a person right you're a human right by the way interesting side note does anybody here know can you tell me what the Hebrew word for human being no you all know it you read it all the time in the Bible the Hebrew word for human being is Adam when the Bible tells that he created Adam in his own image it's like say he he he said he created the human beings his own that's why he says male and female created he them plural but in English we just use the same word we didn't translate it we use the word Adam in our Bible Adam means human beings why is that important because if he created him in his own image he created him spirit Spirit God and everything that Spirit God that he called man was we we are you know when brother bam talks about the condens of the self-existence nothing existed not Darkness not life not space not vacuum nothing but eloh and this thinking and I don't know how many years in our time because there wasn't even time but it must have been trillions and trillions and trillions of our years because before he even spoke the first creative word he had already perfectly designed you and how many hairs you would have and what day you would be born and how many hairs you would lose and on what day you would lose them and how many extras he would have to create in his movie so that you could have people around you you know what I mean by extras right see each one of you are the individual stars of your movie and in your life I'm just an extra before he spoke the first creative word of there be light he knew everything about you and so he planned that I would be here today to speak to you sitting there in the chair but you were the entire focus of that you say well that doesn't really kind of make sense because there's too many people here who are stars of the movie well to to put it in a simplistic way when the composer amadas would sit down he put a sheet of paper in front of him he would begin to hear the music in his mind and he would write down each note he only had to write it down once he didn't have to edit every note that the flute and how the the violin would come in at a certain time and how the saxophones would would come in in focus and the notes that the piano would play whether it would Be chords for harmony Melody all these things he would write down and that that's what we have here today A composium of a small section of great orchestra that God has constructed of which we are but ausc part of it because all across the globe the same part of the symphony is being played each one doing their part all together making a melodious sound to our Creator God each part important now we didn't in the Bible he was a great person not his physical makeup but what he was in his spiritual makeup he was the son of God so Elohim then El after he thought all this he couldn't stay away from it any longer the desire to fellowship with us grew so great it burst out of him let there be light what what what came into existence light now could we see it with invisibilized no we couldn't see it with visible but it was there nevertheless the Greek Scholars call it the Logan it was the word of God it was the son of God like a son playing before the doorsteps of his father's house get to just throw things around playing around he created the universe the galaxies and he he made a mess just just like your children do they make a mess you say no brother Burnie what you mean he made a mess the Bible tells us that he made a mess in the beginning God created heaven and earth in the beginning was the word lust and the lust was with God and the loest was God all things were made by him not a thing was made that was not made by him for in the beginning the logus created the heavens and the Earth just playing around he made a mess and the spirit of God the world was without form and void and in chaos and the word of God hovered over the face of the waters and then brother Bram says and now the work of creation began how could that be the beginning of the works of creation everything before that was play yeah God can create when he's playing who knows how many millions of years he created for who knows but then it came time to go to work you ever notice your kids they can play all day every day 247 and when they're really small one or two time to go to bed I don't want to go to bed I'm not tired no you got to go to bed it's bedtime and you make them go to bed it seems like the minute their heads hit the pillow they're out they got all tired playing they don't know it they're playing they don't get tired but after seven days of work of creation six days man this is hard work I'm going to rest on the seventh day rest that logos was the son of God and then El and the Son of God had a conference and he said let us make man in our image he created Adam Spirit man always remember Adam means human beings you want to find yourself in the creation of God there you go you you are you are Adam and then God brother Brown says that was the third part man is the third part of the Trinity of God is the it says God what is it God manifesting himself in the logos the same God manifested himself in the logos then that same God manifesting himself in man Spirit man and through Spirit man begins to govern the Earth the same way the Holy Spirit should be governing the church today so the spirit man brother B equates him to the Trinity Holy Ghost the third Office of the deity of God but it's the same God Elohim El that existed by himself then manifested himself in the logos then manifested himself in Adam or human being no wonder he said where Were You Remember come on you can do it where were you when the sons of God out for joy as I plac the stars in the heaven how were they shouting for Joy they were playing you shout for Joy when you're playing all those things happened when the logus was playing who was he playing with okay sorry he was the son of God he went around and he healed the sick the lame yall believe he did that well now did he do it at his leisure Oh I thought I'd catch you on that but I didn't good teacher brother Bose who been teaching we went in no he didn't do it at his leisure he said it's not me that doeth the works it's my father wait a minute I thought it was the son of God in human flesh doing the work excuse me the Son of God in human flesh manifesting the office of the son of man healing the people but yet he said it's not me that doth the work it's the father amen him being the Son of God did not claim to be a Divine healer is that right he said that's the father no flesh is before God it was the father that did now when when the son of man when when brother Branham operated the ministry of the son of man revealing back to us the word of God Jesus Christ the son of God all he was doing was making a bridge path backwards to Elohim a Elohim brother Braham says these these mysteries in the book Feast of the trumpet these great Mysteries that were brought in our day Vindicated by Jesus Christ himself doing the same work that he did proving himself the same yesterday today and forever and the reason why these Mysteries were brought was so that we would know how to live our daily life so he revealed something what did he reveal how we should live our daily life but that's just too simple for us we want something much more complicated than that much more glorious or more mysterious more woess glor what is the son of man he that the word of God has come you know your you're your founding pastor of Thomas I know you've heard him say said I don't have a gift of God I have the gift what what what are we talking about here who the word of God Has Come has the word of God come to you has it revealed to you position in Christ or you still trying to take someone else's place are you still struggling and wrestling with the scriptures to try to understand something that's not for you to understand I was talking with brother Tommy yesterday he said something just spark the line you know where one body in Christ Jesus and he's coming back for his body she has dressed herself with every word of God you know sometimes I think we we try to put the veil on our head and maybe you're the head and then you put the veil on your head and then you think oh that's not all the word and then you put your shoes on top of your head and then you put your underneath clothing on top of your head and then you put all your dress on top of your head because I'm the head and I have to be dressed with every word that comes out of the mouth of God I think that we have a lot of gloves on the feet of the body of Jesus Christ we have a lot of shoes hanging in our ears and we think we're waiting for the last lost one to come in but maybe we're just waiting for the last member of the body of Christ to get itself in its own place Lord Jesus take away my confusion fill me with your light show me your will in my life that's what your Mysteries came for so I could know how to live my daily life how do I live my daily life every born again Christian has the right to hear the voice of God directly make yourself a little closet room go into there don't let anybody bother you close the door ask God your question tell him how great he is ask him your question and then shut your mouth and listen amen and you will hear the voice he's obligated he said it might take a half hour take an hour I take a day or two might take some weeks might take 21 days like it did for Daniel but he will have to brother BR said he'll tell you yes or no no or wait a little longer but you'll know have heard but what did this great man do who deser the hearts of the people who raised a little boy in Finland sickness and blindness and lameness disappear before his prayer what did he reveal to us how to live my dad told me one time son it wasn't the Miracles that brother B that through my dad did my my my brother-in-law Alex berunda did more miracles than I ever saw brother bam do what drew me brother was his in the days of the voice of seventh angel when he shall same thing that happens when the ministry of the son of man is re what is that Ministry that is God in that's you brother yes brother BR was talking about the prophet he said what is a prophet anyways it's just an old it's New Testament preacher is uh a preacher New Testament preacher every preacher is a prophet what is a prophet he that the word comes what is the word logus the Son of God logos the Son of God and then he says I'd rather you live me a message than preach me a message behind the pit so what is he saying we're all preachers we're all preaching a message but we're doing it with our life and when we do it with our life we're revealing the son of man because son of man means Goden I'm going to have my son sing a song and then whoever follows me and come up God bless you thank you for all your attention and uh I hope I didn't I hope I didn't
