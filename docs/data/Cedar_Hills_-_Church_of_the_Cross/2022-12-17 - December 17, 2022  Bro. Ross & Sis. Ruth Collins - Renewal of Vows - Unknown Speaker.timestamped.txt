[16:56] what a beautiful couple
[16:59] very very happy this afternoon to be
[17:03] able to draw an eye to God's throne of
[17:06] grace and mercy and ask him to give us
[17:09] our daily portion let us bar heads
[17:13] we're grateful Lord Jesus for this
[17:15] opportunity Lord
[17:17] of what we know today and that is your
[17:21] sacred scripture your word that it gives
[17:24] us so many promises
[17:26] and father we come to you Lord this
[17:29] afternoon
[17:30] with our hearts full of joy and and our
[17:33] hearts beating as one of what is going
[17:37] on before us
[17:39] and this is just a symbol of what you're
[17:42] doing with your church father I pray for
[17:44] my uncle Ross my Aunt Ruth that have
[17:47] been such a shining example to us may it
[17:50] filter all the way on down to each and
[17:53] every one of us and father at the end of
[17:55] this we'll be sure to give you all the
[17:58] honor and all the glory in the name of
[18:01] the Lord Jesus Christ we pray amen you
[18:04] may be seated
[18:06] foreign
[18:13] happy this afternoon to be able to say
[18:15] some words on behalf of my uncle Ross
[18:18] and my Aunt Ruth
[18:20] uh
[18:22] the scripture tells us
[18:24] let us be glad and rejoice and give
[18:27] honor to him for the marriage of the
[18:29] Lamb has come and his wife hath made
[18:32] herself ready
[18:35] it is of a great importance to us I took
[18:40] took took a liberty to
[18:43] to
[18:45] to take go to the sacred scripture
[18:48] the Bible tells us then Joshua called 12
[18:51] men whom he had prepared for the
[18:52] children of Israel out of every tribe of
[18:55] man and Josh was said unto them pass
[18:57] over before the Ark of the Lord your God
[18:59] into the midst of Jordan and take ye up
[19:02] every man of you a stone upon his
[19:05] shoulder according unto the number of
[19:07] the tribes of the children of Israel
[19:09] that this may be a sign among you that
[19:11] when your children ask their fathers in
[19:13] time to come saying what mean ye by
[19:17] these Stones then he shall answer them
[19:19] that the Waters of Jordan were cut off
[19:21] before the Ark of the Covenant of the
[19:24] Lord when it passed over Jordan the
[19:26] Waters of Jordan were cut off and these
[19:29] Stones shall be a memorial unto the
[19:32] children of Israel forever
[19:35] 60 years does not
[19:37] happen overnight
[19:40] 60 years is is a legacy
[19:44] it is done by people that believe God's
[19:47] word
[19:48] growing up
[19:50] first place we ever come was any
[19:53] anything ever happened in the Pettis
[19:55] family
[19:56] we always went to uncle Ross and at
[19:58] Ruth's house
[19:59] it was just a simple place we'll see you
[20:01] there everyone knew where there was at
[20:04] and we're
[20:05] thankful to the life
[20:08] that God has given them and has showed
[20:11] upon us their life is a memorial to us
[20:14] and anybody ever want to know what 60
[20:17] years looks like and what the Triumph of
[20:20] life is
[20:21] is you see a living example here today
[20:26] as my papa got sick
[20:28] the the greatness of their lives was to
[20:33] Simply serve
[20:35] and they took care of and have take care
[20:37] of my my Our Father throughout all these
[20:41] years that he's been sick they've taken
[20:43] such great care of him
[20:46] who can replace those things
[20:48] who can imitate those things
[20:51] well we have shining examples of whom to
[20:55] follow
[20:56] when Joshua asks the people they were
[21:00] asked to take up a stone and make a
[21:03] memorial
[21:04] this today is a memorial
[21:06] not of not of of yesterday but a great
[21:10] thing of what God is doing today is it
[21:13] possible in this
[21:14] last time that people can live together
[21:17] for 60 years
[21:20] and the answer is yes
[21:24] does it has a cost
[21:26] it has cost
[21:27] but the pot the Bible's promises to each
[21:31] and every one of us is the truth and the
[21:34] way the way that Jesus Christ said I I
[21:37] am the way the truth and the life and no
[21:39] man cometh to the father but by me and
[21:42] this
[21:43] marriage and these two lovely people
[21:47] that to me are greater today what a what
[21:51] a stunning beauty of a lady
[21:54] what a handsome man
[21:58] this is what God does
[22:02] this is a memorial
[22:05] to the faithfulness of almighty God

[22:16] anniversary with with my my grandma

[29:44] unheard of
[29:46] to see a married couple of 60 years

[35:04] behind the seventh seal you know the
[35:07] mystery uh-huh

[35:44] guy to marry me
[35:52] don't you read the Bible
[35:55] the Bible says
[35:57] because you're gonna go you're still
[35:59] Thin Beautiful the only thing was the
[36:02] color of your hair that changed but it
[36:05] was just such a beautiful girl and
[36:07] you'll go in so easy when that time
[36:10] comes myself is going to be a tight
[36:13] squeeze
[36:15] and you don't you know the Bible it says
[36:18] narrow is the gate
[36:22] yeah
[36:24] so how are you going to make it
[36:30] but
[36:31] it's a double barrel shotgun
[36:35] I can tell you because you're my buddy
[36:38] I don't know how that happened
[36:39] but
[36:41] anyway
[36:44] my sister Ruth once up we were talking
[36:46] and she said you're supposed to be a
[36:49] teacher and don't you know that an angel
[36:52] came down and took a picture of us
[36:55] between the ages of 1825 when we looked
[36:59] the best
[37:01] now I remember
[37:04] one time I was out of state
[37:06] in this church they invited me to preach
[37:09] that Sunday morning
[37:10] after we were through
[37:13] or I was through took me to the
[37:15] fellowship hall and gave us you know we
[37:18] ate there and had Fellowship
[37:19] and one Minister while we were reading
[37:23] came up and said brother lung he said
[37:26] today me and my wife are are celebrating
[37:30] 47 years of marriage
[37:36] it is what do you mean but don't worry
[37:39] there is a place in heaven for Abused
[37:42] woman
[37:43] so
[37:46] so then she tells me
[37:49] he said don't you know that
[37:52] the angel came down and took a picture
[37:55] of him
[37:58] when you got married
[38:00] now I'm gonna
[38:02] make you feel good
[38:05] this guy tell me this guy lived in Los
[38:08] Angeles he could have gone to Hollywood
[38:10] and
[38:11] make some movies this guy was a handsome
[38:14] guy
[38:15] is
[38:18] I've been using pictures of him he got a
[38:21] lot of hair handsome guy
[38:25] that's so then
[38:27] well look look at him now
[38:31] so then Ruth said you know what land
[38:34] I don't care how big he gets I got more
[38:37] to love
[38:39] it
[38:44] that's right
[38:46] human body
[38:48] so then Russ comes in the picture and
[38:50] says you know what
[38:52] that angel came by and when I got
[38:55] married he took a picture of me but what
[38:56] about you
[38:58] what about you
[39:01] when the angel came down
[39:03] and this ascended up again
[39:07] the Lord asked the angel what about the
[39:11] picture of my son Abraham
[39:13] I said serve forgive me
[39:16] he's so ugly he had no good sights so I
[39:19] didn't I didn't take a picture of him
[39:23] anyway he's trying to relax you because
[39:27] um we joke and get together and we love
[39:30] each other
[39:31] but still what is the mystery under the
[39:34] seven seal that how in the world someone
[39:38] from Hanover met somebody from your face
[39:41] the poor guy did not have nobody to play
[39:44] with only with rattlesnakes and jack
[39:46] rabbits you know
[39:49] but I remember he and your father tell
[39:53] me
[39:55] I I think I don't know if they went to
[39:56] San Pedro to speak you guys didn't know
[39:59] Los Angeles you know and they found an
[40:02] old beat-up car and just side of the
[40:05] road somewhere and I know they stole it
[40:07] or paid one of the guys in skid rows
[40:10] about 25 so here they come in little car
[40:14] he was taking once in a while to San
[40:16] Diego to the naval base
[40:18] and the car died on the stop sign and
[40:22] guess who was behind the car it was a
[40:25] funeral procession see that director
[40:28] gonna get that junk of the roof
[40:33] and then rusted will we can move it so
[40:36] he hit the the funeral director
[40:40] and some guys from the other cars and
[40:43] helped push that Sherman tank that thing
[40:46] was so heavy that old remember
[40:51] you call it the Mexican Mercedes-Benz
[40:55] [Music]
[40:57] so the morticians said you know what one
[40:59] of these days you and your friend are
[41:02] gonna die with that car not too long
[41:04] part of the prophecy came right the year
[41:07] they will go I don't know about one or
[41:09] two in the morning back to San Diego and
[41:11] as they were driving down the freeway to
[41:13] San Diego the car exploded
[41:16] exploded and caught on fire they got
[41:19] down it started hitchhiking and the car
[41:22] just burned in the middle of the freeway
[41:24] so that we got good stories don't we
[41:28] anyway
[41:32] I still love you
[41:35] I still love
[41:36] I love you people
[41:38] remind me about the woman that made out
[41:41] a room for the prophet
[41:44] the prophet would press from his cave
[41:46] and they said we're gonna make a room
[41:48] for him remember and God bless her
[41:51] she they always open the doors and we
[41:53] used to have beautiful Bible studies

[44:53] one of the greatest honors of my life
[44:56] Ministry to be able to be up here

[45:03] of vows to such a wonderful couple
[45:07] and you both look beautiful
[45:09] and
[45:11] it's a pleasure to be called your nephew

[45:19] to be called your pastor
[45:22] um it's a pleasure and a privilege for

[45:25] you know I as I was as I was uh as we
[45:29] get into the to the vows
[45:31] uh just look up
[45:33] and I found out that
[45:35] of everyone that gets married
[45:38] only one percent
[45:40] ever reached 60 years
[45:45] that's six decades together
[45:49] 700
[45:55] 720 months together
[46:00] 3120 weeks
[46:02] 21
[46:04] 915 days
[46:07] 525
[46:09] 960 hours
[46:11] 31
[46:12] 557 600 minutes
[46:16] and one billion 893 million four hundred
[46:20] and fifty six seconds
[46:26] what a ride
[46:28] what a span of time I always remember
[46:30] uncle Ross and he was a great cook
[46:36] one day he
[46:38] decided he was going to make chicken
[46:41] so he put the chicken in the crock pot
[46:43] forgot to put water in there
[46:46] when they got back they opened up the
[46:47] crock pot and how they didn't burn down
[46:49] the house
[46:50] but I hear it was this little black
[46:53] charcoal chicken left
[46:57] wow
[46:58] the symbol of the diamond
[47:00] has represented the 60th wedding
[47:03] anniversary
[47:04] it is the hardest naturally occurring
[47:08] substance on planet Earth
[47:11] diamonds represent the endearing
[47:13] strength of a marriage that has bonded
[47:16] two people together
[47:18] for this long
[47:20] prophet of God says in the message what
[47:22] is the attraction on the mountain
[47:24] that's about the way it is today in the
[47:27] religious crowds
[47:29] when it really comes down to the word in
[47:31] Christ
[47:32] there's only about one percent
[47:35] that really believe
[47:39] about a feat you see to hear and to be
[47:41] part of this 60 years together uh as you
[47:46] all have accomplished this
[47:48] I uh I had a hat on I would take it off
[47:51] and I would tip my hat to you all
[47:53] he says the great Forerunner that has
[47:55] gone before us making a way
[47:58] he came from Spirit
[48:00] the great Fountains of the rainbow of
[48:02] God who had no beginning or no end
[48:05] he was forever God
[48:07] this ray of light went forth it was a
[48:10] ray of love that's the main one he says
[48:13] it's red the next colors that follows
[48:16] blue and on and on and on after that all
[48:19] these seven perfect colors that come
[48:22] from the diamond
[48:24] seven perfect colors
[48:27] which is the seven spirits of God that
[48:29] went for forth from that great fountain
[48:31] or that great Diamond that Jesus spoke
[48:34] of that great Diamond was chipped to
[48:37] reflect these colors
[48:39] and God was made flesh and dwelt amongst
[48:42] us that he might reflect his goodness
[48:44] and his Mercy Among Us by gifts and
[48:48] signs and wonders that whole big rainbow
[48:51] had become in a theophany
[48:53] made in the image of a man yet he wasn't
[48:56] a man he didn't have flesh yet he was a
[49:00] theophany and that was God he had to be
[49:03] wounded for our transgression Bruce for
[49:06] our iniquities he is the big diamond
[49:09] and when you cut a diamond did you ever
[49:12] notice you cut it in a three cornered
[49:15] shape and the sun against that will
[49:17] reflect seven colors and looking red
[49:20] through red looks white did you know
[49:22] that red through red that's the blood
[49:25] the red blood looking God looking at a
[49:27] red sinner through his red blood turns
[49:30] him white he is in the heart you see and
[49:34] so now in that I said God chipped cut
[49:38] bruised to reflect in these Rays as it
[49:42] hits It's the Great word of God it
[49:45] reflects what God really is
[49:48] and so in understanding this and you've
[49:51] reached the diamond wow
[49:53] let's go into the vows
[49:56] and so the first question I want to ask
[49:59] do you wish to continue to live with
