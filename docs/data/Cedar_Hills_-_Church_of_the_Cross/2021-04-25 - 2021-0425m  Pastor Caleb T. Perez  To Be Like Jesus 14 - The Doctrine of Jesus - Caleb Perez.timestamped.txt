[43:01] doctrine of jesus
[43:04] oh my tell your neighbor neighbor the
[43:06] doctrine of jesus
[43:09] somebody want to hear that this morning
[43:10] the doctrine of jesus christ
[43:13] hebrews 13 8 says jesus christ the same
[43:16] yesterday and today and forever
[43:21] and i get a witness all right yeah
[43:24] all right now we're we're doing good
[43:26] this morning let's turn now to the book
[43:28] of saint mark
[43:29] the first chapter
[43:32] and we are going to read from the 21st
[43:34] to the 27th verse
[43:38] once again the doctrine of jesus
[43:43] jesus you have it you can say man
[43:49] there's some pages still going we'll
[43:51] give you a little bit of a little bit of
[43:53] time
[43:57] amen all right it reads like this
[44:01] verse 21 and they went into capernaum
[44:04] and straightway on the sabbath day he
[44:06] entered into the synagogue
[44:08] and taught entrant
[44:15] and they were astonished at his doctrine
[44:20] where he taught them as one that had
[44:22] authority
[44:25] but not as the scribes that's tremendous
[44:29] huh
[44:30] the scribe would teach us they would
[44:33] write they would teach
[44:45] we can teach a lot of things but the
[44:47] question is is there authority behind
[45:02] you're
[45:12] amen that's the way many times the
[45:14] scribes were asiran
[45:16] they taught but didn't have no authority
[45:17] behind it
[45:19] and finally here comes a man
[45:23] that stands up and teaches he insane
[45:26] and has authority behind his teachings
[45:33] and there was in their synagogue a man
[45:36] with an
[45:37] unclean spirit
[45:43] that's tremendous
[45:48] we hear the preaching and we go out the
[45:50] same way
[45:54] shouldn't there be a deliverance going
[45:58] on
[46:05] there was a man with an unclean spirit
[46:06] and he cried out
[46:08] voices saying let us alone what have we
[46:11] to do with thee thou
[46:13] jesus of nazareth
[46:16] jesus come to destroy us
[46:21] what a message it must have been huh
[46:23] authority behind his words
[46:26] our thou come
[46:50] watch this and jesus rebuked him saying
[46:53] hold thy peace and come out of him
[46:58] and when the unclean spirit had torn him
[47:00] and cried with a loud voice
[47:02] he came out of him
[47:06] and they were all
[47:19] they were all amazed in so much that
[47:22] they questioned
[47:52] may god add his blessings to the reading
[47:54] of his word you may be seated
[47:59] what a thing it is he commandeth the
[48:02] unclean spirits they obey him
[48:07] sometimes in a congregation we have a
[48:09] lot of unclean spirits
[48:13] sometimes we come to church and we're
[48:15] full of unclean spirits
[48:18] maybe in the week we've been seeing
[48:20] things that we shouldn't be seeing
[48:23] if you're watching something or seeing
[48:25] something you shouldn't be watching
[48:29] if you're reading something you
[48:30] shouldn't be reading
[48:46] it was so tremendous in in that in in
[48:49] the word of god
[48:52] how many remember last week jesus of
[48:53] nazareth
[48:57] and he got my attention
[49:00] where did where did mary live
[49:04] where did the angel go to to talk to
[49:06] mary
[49:07] maria from nazareth is that right
[49:13] i like that because the bible says
[49:40] it's possible to maintain yourself as a
[49:43] virgin
[49:43] especially wicked age
[49:48] because mary did it in the most wicked
[49:51] town
[49:56] we sure we want to hear the doctrine of
[49:57] jesus
[50:00] let's see why what what what he wants to
[50:02] tell us this morning
[50:05] don't just take it in the natural take
[50:06] it in the spirit
[50:09] watch this as they were all amazed at
[50:13] his doctrines
[50:16] where those unclean spirits obeyed him
[50:20] i'm going to tell you i don't care what
[50:21] you come to church with
[50:23] no important questions
[50:28] maybe drugs or maybe alcohol or
[50:30] pornography or whatever it may be
[50:32] pornography or simply you don't want to
[50:35] listen to your parents
[50:36] implementing or you don't want to listen
[50:38] to god's word
[50:55] [Music]
[51:04] why you should leave this place
[51:22] a church without doctrine brother
[51:23] branham says this
[51:25] is like a jellyfish
[51:29] it has no backbone espinazo
[51:48] we got a
[52:00] and they think that that that's life
[52:04] many people know the doctrine of their
[52:06] church
[52:09] and they think that that's life and all
[52:12] those things are fine
[52:14] we must read our bible we
[52:33] [Applause]
[53:12] and upon the first church is
[53:15] poured out the holy ghost what did they
[53:18] do
[53:19] they healed the sick
[53:24] they raised the dead
[53:45] it was not their own doctrine
[53:48] it was the doctrine of jesus
[53:51] jesus that is the new testament church
[53:54] is like listen in action
[53:58] yes sir yes come on church see you see
[54:00] that is the new testament
[54:02] church in action
[54:05] of jesus notice now doctrine without
[54:09] this authority
[54:12] is not the doctrine of jesus if we don't
[54:15] have the authority to cast out devils
[54:19] we don't have the more authority to heal
[54:21] the sick
[54:22] if we
[54:25] [Applause]
[55:04] mark 17-18
[55:10] and these signs shall follow them
[55:13] that belief
[55:16] we can claim that we are believers
[56:14] the end the commission never dies
[56:20] i want you to tell your neighbor this is
[56:21] important that you get this important
[56:24] tell your neighbor the commission never
[56:28] dies
[56:33] [Applause]
[56:34] and the results are always the same
[56:40] i'm going to say that again i want you
[56:41] to tell your neighbor again
[56:44] the commission never dies
[56:47] the doctrine never changes
[56:51] but the results are always the same
[57:10] different
[57:38] god's will was that nobody would perish
[57:43] through his long suffering he's given us
[57:45] chance after
[57:46] chance
[57:50] and what do we do we ignore
[58:07] i've often said people bring up certain
[58:10] doctrinal points
[58:14] and i often say that if that certain
[58:17] doctrine
[58:19] will cause you to hate your brother or
[58:21] sister
[58:24] i don't want that doctor because it's
[58:27] not
[58:27] producing what the doctrine of jesus
[58:31] was to produce
[58:34] people come to the altar every kind of
[58:37] unclean spirit
[58:40] every foul spirit on them and they live
[58:44] with those same spirits
[58:48] that's not the doctrine of jesus i
[58:51] remember even hearing brother branham
[58:52] one time
[58:56] he left the service says they're driving
[58:59] off
[59:00] he sees a woman in a wheelchair coming
[59:03] out of the service
[59:06] delegation and brother brown says stop
[59:09] why is she coming out of church still in
[59:12] a wheelchair
[59:15] he couldn't put his mind around
[59:26] there's no reason for anyone to be sick
[59:28] amongst them
[59:30] there's no reason
[59:52] how many here want to know the doctrine
[59:55] of jesus
[59:58] jesus
[1:00:00] the doctrine of jesus you know what it
[1:00:02] is
[1:00:04] though your sins be as scarlet
[1:00:09] they shall be quiet
[1:00:25] they shall be as wolves
[1:00:41] when i see this i say man i i i can see
[1:00:43] why they were amazed
[1:00:51] my goodness is he the same yesterday
[1:00:52] today and foreign
[1:00:59] now you might say he's the same but is
[1:01:01] he the same in your life
[1:01:05] that's the question bring it home to
[1:01:06] yourself
[1:01:08] old
[1:01:21] are being saved in their sins
[1:01:36] too many people are being saved in their
[1:01:38] sins
[1:01:40] rather than being saved from their sins
[1:01:44] after 20 years i still like to smoke
[1:01:47] brother
[1:01:49] i still like to why
[1:01:55] i can't put my head around that you know
[1:01:58] how is that
[1:01:58] possible you ever come in contact with
[1:02:02] jesus
[1:02:04] this moment it's not possible
[1:02:09] if you say bro brother i tried it it
[1:02:11] didn't work
[1:02:13] then you you just try the church no
[1:02:16] it's not a church that saves your life
[1:02:31] change your life if we're still doing
[1:02:35] these little things after
[1:02:37] 30 years my goodness
[1:02:40] i like to take a social drink every now
[1:02:42] and then really
[1:02:44] [Applause]
[1:02:47] it's time that we get safe from our sins
[1:02:54] they were amazed at his doctrine
[1:02:58] we should be living a victorious life
[1:03:14] that again did you get that
[1:03:18] yo we should be living a victorious life
[1:03:21] above sin

[1:03:27] christian life

[1:06:47] be able to say
[1:06:48] i've been born again i want your sister
[1:06:51] to say because i've been born again
[1:06:55] because it was his first doctrine that
[1:06:57] he preached
[1:07:00] that's where it all starts that's where
[1:07:02] it all starts
[1:07:04] is the new birth and yet there are so
[1:07:07] many
[1:07:08] versions of the new birth nowadays
[1:07:26] if you just bow your heads and say a
[1:07:27] prayer born again
[1:07:31] blind leaders of the blind santiagos
[1:07:35] leaders is that right come on now so
[1:07:37] many different versions of
[1:07:39] the new birth
[1:07:54] oh you have a tingle down your spine oh
[1:07:56] tina's honest and you got
[1:07:57] really emotional in church

[1:08:48] in other words there is a i don't have
[1:08:51] one here
[1:08:52] but there is a veil there and he simply
[1:08:55] does this
[1:08:57] it's me that's it
[1:09:01] he shows you who he is
[1:09:04] you can
[1:09:18] because
[1:09:34] then jesus called his disciples unto him
[1:09:36] said i have compassion on the multitude
[1:09:44] because they continue with
[1:09:53] [Applause]
[1:09:59] they continue jesus noticed jesus
[1:10:02] that this multitude had continued with
[1:10:05] him for three days
[1:10:08] what are the three days the three stages
[1:10:11] of grace justification
[1:10:28] young people it's okay to do those
[1:10:30] things
[1:10:32] when you come and then you expect a
[1:10:34] quick fix
[1:10:38] no he could do it all at once
[1:10:42] but do you continue when you leave
[1:10:44] church
[1:10:46] can you continue listening to the word
[1:10:52] come on church i want you to understand
[1:10:54] this now

[1:11:08] that's where many people fail
[1:11:24] to the lord son justification
[1:11:28] about this house and now i praise god oh
[1:11:30] i love you justified me
[1:11:31] who's difficult they don't go on but

[1:12:33] most people don't continue

[1:13:10] sidetracked
[1:13:15] oh my
[1:13:19] ouch can i continue on the doctrine of
[1:13:21] jesus
[1:13:24] oh yes the doctrine of jesus
[1:13:28] is to continue in
[1:13:34] the word continue can you put it up
[1:13:36] there young man
[1:13:40] to persist in activity or the process is
[1:13:46] it's to remain in existence
[1:13:50] or operation it's to remain in a
[1:13:54] specified
[1:13:54] position where's our position
[1:13:58] don't understand this
[1:14:11] this is the age that we live in
[1:14:26] agenda
[1:14:40] foreign
[1:14:43] and yet they didn't abandon the faith
[1:14:50] the millennials nowadays los millennials
[1:14:54] have no idea nothing is what it is to
[1:14:57] make a sacrifice for something
[1:15:01] they have no idea of what has been
[1:15:05] sacrificed so that we could have what we
[1:15:08] have
[1:15:30] a nation that is bound to a constitution
[1:15:35] no more that's yeah we have a bunch of
[1:15:38] politicians
[1:15:40] politicos that know zero or nothing
[1:15:42] about god
[1:15:44] and don't even know the sacrifice that
[1:15:48] our forefathers made
[1:16:18] abandoning
[1:16:59] [Applause]
[1:17:00] oh the doctrine of jesus has
[1:17:04] has has never been or never will change
[1:17:10] that was what the apostles preached
[1:17:14] acts chapter
[1:17:23] [Music]
[1:17:27] is there a day here today come
[1:17:40] oh come on you want the doctrine of
[1:17:42] jesus
[1:17:57] they continued in what continued and
[1:18:00] fellowship well i believe what the
[1:18:04] pastor
[1:18:04] said but but i don't want to have
[1:18:06] fellowship
[1:18:10] you can't pick and choose the parts of
[1:18:11] the doctrine you want no points
[1:18:20] don't just eat what you want no sorrow
[1:18:23] this is not a buffet
[1:18:36] why because it'll make you change
[1:18:53] i'm afraid that he's going to send me to
[1:18:55] hell if i don't change
[1:18:59] fear came upon every soul
[1:19:03] that a believer has it's a godly
[1:19:19] but i do have that fear
[1:19:31] and many wonders and signs were done by
[1:19:33] the apostles
[1:19:47] and unto the doctrine continue in them
[1:19:53] this is important this morning got to
[1:19:56] continue in there
[1:19:59] it's not good enough just to have a good
[1:20:02] service
[1:20:17] i was talking the other day me and my
[1:20:18] wife were outside
[1:20:23] here goes our neighbor she stops there
[1:20:27] and and she starts talking about the
[1:20:29] holy ghost
[1:20:42] but the more you hear somebody
[1:20:57] everybody has a name so i named the holy
[1:20:59] ghost
[1:21:03] you don't name my holy ghost
[1:21:09] my i've named him sam
[1:21:13] sam sam why'd you name him
[1:21:18] because i don't know if it's a if the
[1:21:20] holy spirit is male or female
[1:21:23] oh at that moment you could see the
[1:21:26] spirit just picky
[1:21:27] pick out his head
[1:21:30] what a shame
[1:21:33] that you wouldn't even think that yeah
[1:21:39] that you try to put god in some
[1:21:41] non-gender or gender or whatever
[1:21:43] box you built
[1:21:48] somebody that don't know would say wow
[1:21:49] well maybe that's there's some truth
[1:21:53] i don't follow things that have some
[1:21:55] truth in it
[1:21:58] come on young people i want you to hear
[1:21:59] this i don't think that oh
[1:22:01] that sounds i don't follow the word of
[1:22:03] god because it sounds good
[1:22:06] i follow it because i personally have
[1:23:02] i said well one of these days if you
[1:23:03] really want to sit down let's let's down
[1:23:05] and talk
[1:23:08] john 8 31. then jesus said to those jews
[1:23:12] which
[1:23:12] believed on him
[1:23:16] what did they believe on
[1:23:32] is
[1:23:45] john 59 and as the father hath loved me
[1:23:51] so have i loved you
[1:23:55] continue ye in my love
[1:23:59] and we love you as long longest people
[1:24:01] are doing this to us
[1:24:05] but i challenge you and somebody goes
[1:24:08] like this one time
[1:24:10] i challenge you at that moment
[1:24:13] to continue in love okay
[1:24:27] some of these
[1:25:08] if you continue in my words
[1:25:37] oh but i teach them the word open listen
[1:25:45] it doesn't have an effect in our
[1:25:46] children many times
[1:25:48] young people don't use that as an excuse
[1:25:52] because the tree of life is before every
[1:25:54] one of you
[1:25:56] you're going to choose and you're
[1:25:57] choosing right now
[1:25:59] god be god let's serve him
[1:26:02] with that simply all right
[1:26:07] continue is the key continuous and if
[1:26:10] you go into the scripture you'll find
[1:26:12] paul telling the people
[1:26:20] to continue
[1:26:35] john sums it up well in second john 1 9.
[1:26:40] whosoever transgressive
[1:26:43] and abideth not in the doctrine of
[1:26:45] christ
[1:26:48] hath not
[1:27:30] young man you guys didn't even say
[1:27:31] nothing
[1:27:33] i'm going to go keep going
[1:27:41] [Applause]
[1:27:44] all right let's go on
[1:27:48] because if i get into this i ain't
[1:27:49] getting out for a while
[1:27:56] so you got a little room
[1:28:27] comfortable this morning watch this now
[1:28:31] that's why when we look at this
[1:28:34] why so many people follow jesus
[1:28:38] jesus so many people followed brother
[1:28:40] branham
[1:28:42] followed the different messengers that
[1:28:44] god sent
[1:28:46] different messages they followed them
[1:28:49] when they were healing the sick
[1:28:52] when they were raising the dead doing
[1:29:18] oh we love the lord when he's healing or
[1:29:20] healing our
[1:29:21] my baby or my my loved one and he heals
[1:29:24] them
[1:29:27] we love the lord we love the ministry
[1:29:31] but when the word comes forth it begins
[1:29:34] to tell us where we're wrong
[1:29:52] as long as you're going and having a
[1:29:53] good time
[1:29:55] [Music]
[1:29:58] yeah let's go out let's have fun they
[1:30:00] love you
[1:30:01] all praise god we go to church
[1:30:04] okay
[1:30:17] that's right
[1:31:14] watch this they loved all those things
[1:31:19] but when the next stage of their
[1:31:20] ministry began
[1:31:28] continuing
[1:31:30] same 70 people
[1:31:33] 70 disciples the same 70 that
[1:31:38] jesus sent out they came
[1:31:41] back rejoicing
[1:32:08] and they said the bible is what the
[1:32:10] bible said that they said
[1:32:13] this is a hard statement
[1:32:17] and they walked no more with him
[1:32:22] hard statements young
[1:32:37] you can only continue if if there is
[1:32:39] that faith
[1:32:42] the revelation to do so because the word
[1:32:45] of god is so
[1:32:46] contrary to us as human beings are
[1:32:49] thinking
[1:32:52] his thoughts his ways are so far above
[1:32:55] ours
[1:32:58] so let's go on
[1:33:06] are you still
[1:33:48] they married
[1:33:59] likewise also as it was in the days of
[1:34:01] lot
[1:34:02] they
[1:34:10] but the same day that lot went out of
[1:34:11] sodom it rained fire brimstone from
[1:34:14] heaven and destroyed them all
[1:34:19] thus shall it be in the day when the son
[1:34:22] of man
[1:34:23] is revealed
[1:34:27] and the word revealed once again
[1:34:56] when will the kingdom of god come
[1:35:05] you don't have to look on the internet
[1:35:07] to find the kingdom of god
[1:35:10] the kingdom of god is within you know
[1:35:30] he turns to his disciples and he begins
[1:35:32] to speak about the days of
[1:35:34] three distinct persons
[1:35:40] the days of
[1:35:51] because in there you find three groups
[1:35:54] of people
[1:36:20] shall it be in the day of the son of man
[1:36:28] the son of man
[1:36:32] [Applause]
[1:36:34] we don't fit in the day of noah
[1:36:50] of man so shall it be
[1:36:55] when the son of man is revealed
[1:36:58] where is he being revealed
[1:37:01] is jesus christ he revealed himself in a
[1:37:05] prophet
[1:37:07] by staying and continuing in the world
[1:37:11] revealing himself over the body of
[1:37:14] believers
[1:37:16] that's you and i this the days is the
[1:37:20] son of man is revealed
[1:37:23] what day is that your day is my day
[1:37:26] me the day of the son of man
[1:37:29] revealing himself
[1:37:40] i can go through all these three things
[1:37:41] brother brown talks about three pools
[1:37:46] talks about noah and his three pools and
[1:37:49] if i had time i would go through noah's
[1:37:51] and his three three pools
[1:37:52] so you can you can study that out if you
[1:37:54] like
[1:37:56] go to the message souls that are in
[1:37:57] prison now
[1:38:43] all that would believe
[1:38:47] into the ark we see first we see second
[1:38:51] and then we will see the third preacher
[1:39:09] that sign was the end times
[1:39:14] the first thing you know the door was
[1:39:15] closed
[1:39:18] and there was only one person that know
[1:39:20] or that knew that that sign what that
[1:39:21] sign was
[1:39:48] the bible said the sins of sodom vexed
[1:39:51] his righteous soul daily
[1:41:15] and told him what was going on behind
[1:41:17] him
[1:41:19] he's the one that abraham was crying
[1:41:24] i'm gonna destroy sodom he said if you
[1:41:27] can find 50 would you not destroy them
[1:41:44] wow we could get into a lot of things
[1:41:47] and
[1:41:48] and that but we'll we're gonna we need
[1:41:49] to because of time i think my time is
[1:41:51] almost up
[1:41:52] yeah let's go forward but as he went on
[1:41:57] you see the picture developed
[1:42:09] and all that's left
[1:42:32] like i said each one of those is a study
[1:42:34] in itself
[1:42:36] but i want to get to something here
[1:42:39] jesus ministries
[1:42:43] three polls brother branham says you
[1:42:45] said that mother branham what was
[1:42:47] what is and what will come
[1:42:52] watch the parallels of his ministry two
[1:42:54] thousand years ago
[1:42:58] and his ministry through a prophet in
[1:42:59] these last days
[1:43:02] his first poll brother braham says jesus
[1:43:04] first pool
[1:43:08] he become very
[1:43:23] now it's not the first poll that shows
[1:43:25] what's on the inside of the person
[1:43:29] it's the second pool
[1:43:33] because the second pole comes the
[1:43:36] discernment
[1:43:51] he was the prophet that moses spoke
[1:43:54] and when he went to tell them how they
[1:43:58] were living
[1:44:00] and the things they were doing
[1:44:03] he become very unpopular
[1:44:09] we know that that's the attitude we take
[1:44:11] many times
[1:44:13] that was the second poll brother says i
[1:44:17] wonder if it has typed right back again
[1:44:22] remember he was judas iscariot very
[1:44:25] religious
[1:44:28] but he couldn't go all the way
[1:44:43] now the holy spirit is working in your
[1:44:45] soul right now
[1:45:14] that's right
[1:45:24] [Music]
[1:45:29] he would he could take part of the
[1:45:31] message
[1:45:33] but the rest of it he couldn't stomach
[1:45:38] like many people even today they can
[1:45:41] take
[1:45:42] part of the message
[1:46:09] the only way you'll ever get help
[1:46:38] here's
[1:46:51] are you getting it
[1:47:20] is
[1:47:33] he turned around and said you
[1:48:18] you can't kill the ministry
[1:48:21] it lives on
[1:48:25] you can put the messenger to sleep
[1:48:29] but you can't put the message to sleep
[1:48:41] [Applause]
[1:49:26] but nobody
[1:49:54] his ministry was rejected by the people
[1:49:58] he then preached to those souls that
[1:49:59] were unsavable
[1:50:02] he preached to the lost that couldn't be
[1:50:03] saved anymore
[1:50:05] souls in hell that did not accept mercy
[1:50:08] deliver
[1:50:23] a vosotros ah
[1:50:26] and as watch this now and as the father
[1:50:30] sent him to preach to the living
[1:50:32] parallel to those who had hope
[1:50:36] and then present
[1:50:49] because the spirit of christ living in
[1:50:52] us
[1:50:54] does not change the nature of him
[1:50:58] or doesn't change god's system
[1:51:01] he must be the same in every generation
[1:51:04] the
[1:51:18] in his
[1:51:22] [Music]
[1:51:24] does anybody believe that okay the same
[1:51:27] ministry
[1:51:28] reincarnated in his church right now
[1:51:46] and if
[1:52:02] [Applause]
[1:52:15] three pools of his ministry
[1:52:18] you know what they are right yes first
[1:52:20] pull somebody help me
[1:52:22] get this own friend phone the audience
[1:52:24] do whatever you got to do
[1:52:28] personally praying for the sick
[1:52:30] exactly and and what did he have the
[1:52:33] gift that he gave
[1:52:34] his his hand would turn colored right
[1:52:35] right right he would know he would have
[1:52:37] vibrations and so forth
[1:52:41] the second pole
[1:52:56] it number one it was the opening of the
[1:52:59] words
[1:53:05] it was the power of the spoken word now
[1:53:08] in action
[1:53:52] let's not
[1:54:47] do something for god
[1:55:00] and pray and believe god for these
[1:55:02] things
[1:55:36] [Music]
[1:55:43] in the message of the new ministry he's
[1:55:44] in
[1:56:11] god wants us then to
[1:56:24] saw the multitude that they had
[1:56:26] continued
[1:56:40] hello
[1:57:07] and they hurt his doctrine and were
[1:57:09] amazed
[1:57:12] he had such authority
[1:57:18] that's where god's trying to get the
[1:57:20] church
[1:57:23] to have the same authority
[1:57:26] as sons of god whole creation is
[1:57:30] groaning
[1:57:32] we pray for them now but then
[1:57:50] pool because he cannot
[1:57:54] impersonate him he can impersonate the
[1:57:58] first poor
[1:57:58] person but he can impersonate the third
[1:58:02] place
[1:58:04] because you
[1:58:11] [Music]
[1:58:29] that you better have authority
[1:58:47] to its perfect condition once again
[1:58:51] bringing us to our original condition
[1:58:53] with god
[1:58:56] and it will not be used in a great way
[1:58:58] until this council begins to tighten up
[1:59:14] you're not used to sitting so long but
[1:59:16] but but pinch yourself
[1:59:19] i wanted to see jesus christ this is
[1:59:22] brother branham's desire
[1:59:24] i wanted to see jesus christ manifested
[1:59:28] manifesto
[1:59:30] without one flaw
[1:59:34] i look in the mirror i see so many flaws
[1:59:39] brother brown's desire i want to see him
[1:59:42] manifested
[1:59:45] in other words that we can get ourselves
[1:59:48] out of the way
[1:59:51] there will be no flaws
[2:00:11] once again i wanted to see jesus christ
[2:00:15] manifested without of
[2:00:16] one flaw
[2:00:19] but being known to the church here
[2:00:21] that's during his time
[2:00:24] to the church
[2:00:31] [Applause]
[2:00:52] where nobody can say one word against
[2:00:57] that's the problem is we don't go far
[2:00:58] enough
[2:01:00] we love first polls
[2:01:03] we love healing services we love the
[2:01:06] movement of the spirit
[2:01:18] so then when when does a ministry then
[2:01:21] come to its perfection
[2:01:26] closing with this ministry
[2:01:32] when it's been preached
[2:01:43] when does a ministry come to its
[2:01:44] perfection
[2:01:46] the ministry comes to its
[2:01:48] perfectionistic
[2:02:02] that's why people get this when people
[2:02:04] say oh brother brown preached the
[2:02:05] message
[2:02:08] the lamb broke the seals through his
[2:02:09] ministry
[2:02:12] that was the ministry of the son of man
[2:02:15] the ministry of the
[2:02:55] his body acting out his mind
[2:03:52] and it's not given just for you to say
[2:03:54] oh i know that
[2:03:58] it's given so that it changes your life
[2:04:01] changes who you are that's why
[2:04:05] the new birth is a revelation of jesus
[2:04:08] christ
[2:04:08] personally to you you can't stay the
[2:04:12] same
[2:04:12] person the mystery should be finished
[2:04:20] you and i and me is death how many love
[2:04:23] the lord when those armenians did you
[2:04:24] stand to your feet
[2:04:27] it's revelation church
[2:04:39] it's revelation
[2:04:42] and we know we don't need a veil anymore
[2:04:48] it's time to take the veil off
[2:05:04] we are changed
[2:05:16] i want to just read this last quote
