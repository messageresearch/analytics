[23:50] can those dollar Candace's Atomos
[23:53] because what is the faith that was once
[23:55] delivered to the same quality la fecha
[23:58] Universal Los Santos what is the saint
[24:02] get some Sun - well sanctified one right
[24:07] brother Branham says you santificado a
[24:09] saint is a sanctified one moon Sun - is
[24:11] a link SEO scientifical so the faith was
[24:14] once delivered love a cocoon of isn't
[24:16] regala that means it's already been it's
[24:18] already here right this cage I Stuckey I
[24:21] guess if it's been delivered it's
[24:22] already here because ya ask you in
[24:24] regards por que esta aqui so are we
[24:28] sanctified once this evening so most
[24:30] entonces santificado sea and esta tarde
[24:32] are we sanctified ones this evening
[24:34] somos certificado Zen esta tarde are we
[24:36] Saints this evening almost Santos and
[24:38] it's the thought of that that faith that
[24:39] was been delivered to us here's a face
[24:42] it trigger and also which is inside of
[24:44] us already well it's not dentro de
[24:45] nosotros when it makes contact
[24:48] but does it contact oh when it makes
[24:50] contact with God or does it contacto
[24:52] conduce then anything is possible called
[24:54] careful size possible no matter what
[24:56] situation you go through the portal
[24:58] casitas UNESCO state because we all have
[25:01] trials right
[25:02] the most promise we all have
[25:04] tribulations right those that are mostly
[25:06] Willis Eunice we all are children of God
[25:10] right those almost see who the deuce so
[25:14] how many think children of God shouldn't
[25:15] have trials so this quad to see oh there
[25:17] is no the very in the tener problemas
[25:22] sounds funny right so now I'm a akuto so
[25:26] the lord were children the God the Lord
[25:27] takes care of us so most evil that he
[25:29] owes and no squid ah yes he does lo hace
[25:31] yes the Lord does take care of us no

[25:37] every single day
[25:37] no private Khalid eeeh he's gonna try
[25:40] your faith every day for about so fake
[25:42] an idea because once your faith rests on
[25:45] God's eternal word those who fear a post
[25:47] on a palabra then anything is possible
[25:49] this is called Carcosa as possibly you
[25:55] know we can go back all through the
[25:57] Bible otra vez de la vie Lia and we can
[26:00] we have perfect examples of faith if it
[26:02] the most imperfect o salafi right we can
[26:04] go we can start with with Abraham when
[26:06] most of us are Conover I'm right he was
[26:08] given a promise
[26:09] I said I'd even a promesa right did it
[26:11] come right away we know inmediatamente
[26:13] no it didn't come right away from you
[26:16] know I see the rapido when he stood on
[26:18] God's Word mauricio para la palabra de
[26:21] Deus he stood and believe God's Word
[26:23] yelkur yo la palabra de Deus and when he
[26:25] made contact equal to e so con talk to
[26:27] when that fakes make contact with God's
[26:29] Word this a face of kentuc to color

[54:27] and said unto them privately he will
[54:29] minister a los libros lady ho apart a
[54:32] bless there are the eyes which see we
[54:35] don't close loss what was given the
[54:37] things that you see
[54:38] look what sort of races so tonight
[54:40] blessed it are your eyes in this you
[54:42] suppose because you think yesterday
[54:44] those things before I tell you that many
[54:49] prophets and Kings have desired to see
[54:51] those things which you see because you
[54:53] okay muchos profit the serious this year
[54:55] on we're looking was of those ways and
[54:58] have not seen them in low Vietnam and to
[55:01] hear those things which you hear your
[55:03] loss loss look a ways and have not heard
[55:06] them you know or you don't know what a
[55:09] bless the people that we are in to see
[55:11] them so I just read you this whole thing
[55:13] here the latest those lucky what makes a
[55:16] man do that yes don't normally a status
[55:18] quo stuff because the Lord has allowed
[55:19] um it's in your blood or the house to
[55:21] see what prophets have never seen the
[55:25] Prophet as dr. Viren
[55:26] what wise men have longed to see you
[55:28] killed hombres Chavez nunca
[55:30] and we have been privileged to see those
[55:32] things you know mostly the probably
[55:33] carelessness caused us and the Bible
[55:34] says in 25 love you ladies have made
[55:36] distinct oh and behold a certain lawyer
[55:38] stood up and tempted him saying master
[55:40] what shall I do to inherit eternal life
[55:43] he one interpreted del la silla want o
[55:48] ez ho but I probably maestro haciendo ki
[55:51] Kostas era demos la vie Eterna and he
[55:54] said unto Him in adikam what is rain in
[55:57] the law gets the script on a lane how do
[56:00] you read it
[56:00] Kamali's what's written in the law how
[56:04] do you read it and he answered him
[56:08] saying thou shalt love the Lord thy God
[56:11] with all thy heart and with all thy soul
[56:14] and with all thy strength and with all
[56:17] thy mind and thy neighbor as thyself can
[56:20] respond generally for Amar's Elsinore
[56:22] Julia's canto to Corazon in canto to
[56:24] Alma in canto this versus a control to
[56:27] maintain yeah via tube pro chemo come on
[56:32] to mismo so it really opens up something
[56:34] here after Albuquerque because as he
[56:37] tells his disciples become oblivious to
[56:39] this applause less than are your eyes in
[56:40] the circus for they see or give in now
[56:43] we know that to see the most cake it
[56:46] better is to understand right parent in
[56:48] there and so this lawyer interpreted
[56:52] only he's asking Jesus logistics what
[56:55] must I do to inherit eternal life and he
[56:59] said how do you read the law it's a post
[57:01] como como la la I love the Lord thy God
[57:03] with all their heart your mind first and
[57:08] then love your neighbor your logo our
[57:10] mistress you know but that's not were

[57:21] I'm an assayer how many love God what
[57:23] torment of those everybody loves God
[57:25] right some one of the other so there's

[1:11:43] custom ring and just let the new life
[1:11:45] come up be like your saligan and the old
[1:11:48] leaf drops off yellow be Ephesus okay
[1:11:51] that's the same thing it is about the
[1:11:52] Spirit of God
[1:11:53] hey let me I'm across our Zilla spirit
[1:11:54] to live yours whether you're a Christian
[1:11:56] or not is Christian or let the new life
[1:11:58] of Christ come in the Christian life
[1:12:02] dicey la Vida Posada vehicle can you
[1:12:06] become a new creature what a be innocent
[1:12:07] work computer in Christ Jesus Cristo
[1:12:10] pursues oh that's what it is always look
[1:12:12] yes so many don't discern the Lord's
[1:12:15] body
[1:12:15] muchos notice here look what will the
[1:12:17] senior and we find Cain and Abel in
[1:12:19] control Sakai in the oven and everybody
[1:12:21] says oh that Cain
[1:12:23] okay or excuse me Abe over uh he loved
[1:12:26] God a llama adios more than Cain damask
[1:12:28] and that's not true yes almost hear them
[1:12:30] Cain love God just as much as able to
[1:12:35] come on Cain went to church ain't wear
[1:12:37] like this yeah just as much as Abel
[1:12:39] vehicle mode
[1:12:40] in fact Cain's offering his master in
[1:12:43] the friend okay if you think about it
[1:12:45] you look inside his offering
[1:12:47] okay official was more sweat of the brow
[1:12:49] than enables it but as I could be so
[1:12:52] much worse okay kid right it took more
[1:12:56] work to grow out and growth grow the
[1:12:58] fruit vegetables must rock with the
[1:13:01] oculus cosmic a thoughtless meant to
[1:13:02] slay a lamb they're imported elite
[1:13:06] though so Cain loved God
[1:13:08] Kane are more so we find out what the
[1:13:10] difference was uncle Thomas levy parents
[1:13:12] yeah what's the offering kettle ofrenda
[1:13:14] and the reason we come here tonight you
[1:13:17] must like it Astor Rochester bring an
[1:13:18] offering I don't know but it depends on
[1:13:20] what kind of offering you're bringing
[1:13:22] because God isn't just pleased you know
[1:13:26] uh you know with just any kind of
[1:13:31] worship one well pleased just any kind
[1:13:37] of offering won't get ofrenda the Bible
[1:13:39] says that he looks for worship in spirit
[1:13:44] and when you have the truth but no still
[1:13:49] alive is that you can't tell me no more
[1:13:51] putting the seed lets you come go steady
[1:13:53] any and when the preacher ask see one
[1:13:55] little politically but I wonder how many
[1:13:57] love the Lord on to someone else in your
[1:13:59] sometimes I look around I wish was muted
[1:14:02] or sometimes people are sleeping yeah
[1:14:09] God doesn't look for worship
[1:14:14] for those that worship Him in spirit and
[1:14:16] in truth
[1:14:17] okay Lauren in spirit to embed of that
[1:14:19] so it matters how you worship God so
[1:14:22] it's important to come you say other
[1:14:24] adduce it matters what you offer God is
[1:14:27] important okay so adios
[1:14:29] but Cain loved God just as much as Abel
[1:14:31] there come on - come on come on in but
[1:14:35] what happens look at lo que canta say in
[1:14:38] closing in surrender is that unless you
[1:14:42] recognize a meniscus tear the Cornhusker
[1:14:45] or unless you real recognized a meniscus
[1:14:49] tear the Cornhusker we heard contending
[1:14:51] for the faith which I wanted in the
[1:14:53] portal affair right well ah now how many
[1:14:55] here has faith want this I keep anything
[1:14:57] right but everybody has faith doesn't
[1:15:01] Stav en so the my question is well then
[1:15:04] what are you waiting for
[1:15:04] entonces que esperan coz if you have
[1:15:08] faith that means that you're waiting for
[1:15:09] something you sit in a phase poor cast a
[1:15:11] spell on do algo right
[1:15:13] well that right you understand that
[1:15:15] that's simple right simply if I have
[1:15:18] faith I had faith that I was gonna see
[1:15:20] brother Ronnie tonight the faith didn't
[1:15:22] forget what a veteran running is right
[1:15:24] now that's no longer faith I see brother
[1:15:26] Ronnie so you know now I'm not waiting
[1:15:28] to see him anymore I I see him you know
[1:15:30] very you know well right so the greatest
[1:15:33] revelation that you can ever receive
[1:15:35] Mundek you snip we receive either the
[1:15:37] greatest revelation leatheran so much
[1:15:39] grande is the supreme deity of the Lord
[1:15:41] Jesus Christ is super no matter the data
[1:15:46] because they keep the crystal the
[1:15:49] supreme deity of who Jesus really is the
[1:15:52] supreme otherkin escazu so I recommend
[1:15:55] you that there's recommend to go back
[1:15:57] and hear the message yet recognition to
[1:15:59] you scooch in my sake
[1:16:00] our pastor preached in Phoenix there was
[1:16:02] no political feelings revelations of
[1:16:04] himself revelations of him sound soon as
[1:16:09] they an amusement the Bible says that
[1:16:10] God so loved the world that He gave
[1:16:14] himself he gave His only because you're
[1:16:17] not what for but okay so that he might
[1:16:20] bring life on again with red vida and
[1:16:23] life more abundantly what's happened
[1:16:26] yeah yep a song because we don't love
[1:16:28] ourselves you know no mames we've
[1:16:29] allowed the devil
[1:16:30] we've allowed the enemy to come in you
[1:16:34] can get you rob from he steals from us

[1:17:11] lament the heart
[1:17:14] and anything that will cause you equal
[1:17:16] kill cosas que la causa to get out of
[1:17:18] whack yeah okay so luckily for your your
[1:17:23] mind to get out of control the semantics
[1:17:25] is upon whether they control your spirit

[1:17:30] saved itself whether it should be
[1:17:32] aborted a child of whether and in
