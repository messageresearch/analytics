[Music] you need it is my privilege and honor to introduce our founding Pastor is how many are excited for the word tonight the message the message that was preached was God and the individuals because I want to enter into this theme I won't stay very long but the thing that I want you to see is is a thing that I am seeing I look for total Liberation Deliverance Deliverance I look for a total deliverance from everything Una Liberation complete to look for and find a total Deliverance yes I'll go and Trio is something between I and God aren't you happy that even though we are our Collective body Siempre diosotros Como individuals that always deals with us as individuals not as a collective group it's a collective group it means it encounters or it's grouped up in all the kingdom in in El Reino in the kingdom of God I am plan there is a plan pero I I still constances but there are circumstances in the individual okay that does not permit us to enter into the kingdom is we enter with a lot of difficulties and then you understand me there is many difficulties circumstances and there are many circumstances but we do not go through circumstances the Christian does not circumstances the circumstances don't hinder God but they do hinder you asike Ministries if you want god of the Holy Spirit to come and minister to you as an individuals you at times have to come out of order uh we are going to to encounter something look at something let us see something we are going to see something about God and the individual dios God and the individual who stays individual you are an individual Las Vegas if we go through the pews we are going to find out that each and every one of us has one problem or two problems and maybe there will be problems that the wife does not want to tell the husband the husband to the wife the children or the son to the fathers because maybe they say that their problem is very hard that's fine but tell it to God you can open your Bible to the book of Saint Luke chapter 8 verse 43. Luke 8 43. but before we read Luke 8 43. I want to read verse 41. even though I won't be dealing with verse 41. but you'll notice why I read verse 41 and it reads his way everybody ready and behold there came a man named Jairus and he was a ruler of the synagogue and he fell down at Jesus feet and besought him that he would come into his house for he had only one daughter about 12 years of age and she lay a dying but as he went the people thronged him I want you to notice that this woman that we're going to read about yes was hearing Jesus and Jairus Jesus and a woman having an initial Blood also 12 years like the 12 years of the daughter Sangre which had spent all her living upon Physicians neither could be healed of anything came to him and touched the border of his garments and immediately her blood stents while while the main the main picture that was focused on by the people because sometimes we tend to look at pictures or seek big things in the message we sometimes worry a lot about Thunders and no Thunders we worry a lot about one Soul two souls or three Souls we worry a lot about return Ministry or no return Ministries but this woman was interested in something besides that President she could not focus on something great and I'll go Grande unless she did the Lesser works you know they they asked brother Branham because brother Branham is quoting the scriptures and he says on the scripture that greater words than this shall they do it is and he says there cannot be any Greater Works than what Jesus did because Jesus but there will be more works because there will be more of US foreign [Music] isn't this that we do greater things it is and brother Branham answered that preacher eleven respond he said do the lesser works first before you attempt the greater word and that's I think that's a great lesson for us a lot of times we want to do great works and we forget the Lesser word we forget how to love one another treat at times it seems like we want to know great things when we forget to heal or ask for our healings this woman was sick she went let me read for you one scripture and we'll keep on The Book of Numbers chapter five do you love the Lord how many want a Deliverance a complete one Liberation total completa and it says this in numbers five the Lord spoke unto Moses saying command the children of Israel that they put out of the camp every leper and everyone that has an issue and whosoever it is defiled by the dead is amen both male and female shall you put them that they defile not their camps in the midst therefore I dwellers did you notice this word is from God how many believe that no one that had an issue no matter what was permitted to come amongst the people today we seem to be real wishy-washy on these things we we have people that defile the temple El Temple and we feel sorry for them and we try to get them maybe back without you knowing if there is some contaminations I don't know if you if you can follow me this this evening but I feel very moved by God to speak on this sometimes God can have a curse on someone and you pray for that Persona prophet of God said you're going to get into trouble we have to be very careful now if if you go and pray for some and you touch them the hospital people hospitals they have signs that say wash your hands with soap and water losses amen amen now if you touch something and you happen to wipe your mouth you can very easily get that germ inside of you gotta be very careful I don't believe the Bible misses it when it says pray for your food and if you touch any deadly things it will not harm you now Eva persona persona has a manchado when when when you speak about you can speak a lot on this concerning bathrooms and what have you they put it because people sometimes don't care and then somebody died and then they ask him what did he die they say we don't know she just died or she just died but God for a reason that maybe you and I don't understand it says when a person has an issue and she sits upon the saddle of a horse and you go and sit on it be known that you have been defiled by that Persona so no person that is should be touching another person the person the person according to the Bible the 15th chapter of The Book of Leviticus that person was not permitted to come to church could not enter into the Tabernacles enter and touch the priests but that Persona if he was sick could come in an interview with the priests and the priest would offer a sin or a burnt offering for their sins would have to live the premises and stay away for seven days until the evening after after seven days and when the priest would look at the issue if it had white with maybe white hair Blanca he sent them out for seven more days you understand seven more days until the evening time and that person is a persona had to return after seven days after seven days the priest would check it again and if he would find a scab you see miraba unna he would Proclaim him clean and stanced blood stands from that is you understand if if you can understand a little of that is you can understand the eighth chapter of the Book of Luke this woman she didn't contact the priest she had no faith anyone that could do that so but in the evening time of our life she encountered that in control so before we get to that will follow a little bit about this woman and this garment is the Persona in this condition is you understand that so when a person has an issue I want you when you go home read the 15th chapter of The Book of Leviticus This Woman's conditions she won't tell anyone that she had an issue if anyone knew that she had an issue it was because maybe the Physicians had told them but she told no soul that's why amongst the crowds multitude because if the crowd would have known she had an issue they would have taken her aside and stoned her to death yes so so more and more the picture builds up into this woman must be the issue is show me a scripture where it says that if you Touch the Hem of the garments that you can be healed you know brother brothers it talks about certain ministers that pray over the radio and television it is and and the thing was this that they would say as I'm praying for you place your hand upon the radio or the television amen foreign she saw a lot of people that had that had garment all the way down to the feet but she wasn't about to touch just anybody's garments she received Faith by hearing a certain individuals and she said if I could just Touch the Hem of His garments she had no scripture for it is era [Music] I wanted to do this and I wanted to do that I knew it was out of order so I didn't do it you understand at the end then oh I but I didn't do it this little woman esta Mujer wasn't like that she said I know you said the Bible or the scriptures looking Echo you can stand it I have a circumstancia she's she's her problems her circumstances no problem people days [Music] [Laughter] individual and that's why many got contaminated because they took like a tomato they should have left it alone this is the way she went yes she got near him yeah brother Branham says was there that virtue on the Garment he said no more virtue than you woman touching the Hem of your skirt no matter no more virtue than you men touching the Hem Of Your Overcoat no matter but where did she pick it up because watch this if a woman says she sits on it she says when she touched on his garments apartment baby [Laughter] there's a way to judge Pizza [Laughter] gritando religion that is try to get to Jesus Through The Hem at the result if that blood is I I was thinking yes in a message that my son preached in Phoenix blood fights blood Sangre well that was what was wrong with my wife Esposa they couldn't give her her own blood cause blood and tell me today if blood doesn't fight blood contamination contamination it's hard Duro but there's Deliverance liberation if we look see miramos to ah Jesus by faith you understand by faith Faith cometh by hearing there being a foreign she heard Jesus talking to Jairus Jesus and she had heard some other things about Jesus but when Jairus said I have a daughter 12 years old that this woman her name was Victoria is don't ask me where I got her name but her name was Victoria Victoria heard Jesus talking to Jairus Victoria Oyo Jesus and when she heard 12 years she she knew that her issue had been there 12 years that did something to Victoria yes he's calling him to heal his daughter that was born when I got the bloody shoes [Music] [Music] and he was he was uh then he was converted to a Baptista but he he was a sinner he would go from the Catholic to the baptism and then back from the Baptist to the Catholics doesn't that remind you of a lot of people in the message because they haven't found it yet or can no longer well that man's soul brother he said Brothers he says I want Deliverance so bad but I I get prayed foreign other people [Music] when you were a child he says why you forget okay you would always have that on you in the church where you touched the Hem of His garments what it is that Jesus went to many cities and many villages uh he said they picked it up from that woman is he says she's far away from me she's not touching my garments but she does so he said nothing when you go by the garments that's physical it was physical but when you go through the dressing a problem you have a problem you can touch him right now when I walked into the hospital with that woman that Saint the other day she looked at me yeah I didn't touch her you're not a lot okay but she tried something what did she Touch the Hem of His garments she took off her mask she took off everything she should have been dead already yeah and she might die tomorrow because if Jesus don't come soon Jesus not only she but I and some of you are going to die but she was touched and I saw her face and she made some statements that you would hardly believe [Music] all his insides were all cuts they expect him to die any minute I remember as we walked into his room he looked at us the next day the doctors came in and he came out yes and he Ian went to the mother that was in the waiting room and he told the mother I don't know what happened last night but your son is not going to die but let me tell you something before we went in that woman never had seen us in her life she looked at us and she said yeah I know that you're man of God when you pass in the ICU through room number three she had tears running down her eyes said look meet me down inside that room that's all you have to do just look inside yourself my son it says the next day and she saw us she fell down at her feet to worship we picked her up we told her worship us he is brother Tony would you play real songs I wonder this evening foreign [Music] if you have received the Android something this is you don't have to come to the altars if you can just raise your hand and touch him [Music] he's passing by this building he said somebody has touched Prima [Music] yeah because see but somebody has touched me because [Music] has gone for me the only thing that can
