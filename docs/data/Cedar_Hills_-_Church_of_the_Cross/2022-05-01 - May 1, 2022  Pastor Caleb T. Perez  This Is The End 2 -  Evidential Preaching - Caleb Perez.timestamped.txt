[34:35] i wanted to give uh honor and glory to
[34:37] god
[34:40] for uh for being my healer again
[34:45] so back in january
[34:50] my head developed like
[34:52] a ball and it was it was really painful
[34:58] and
[34:59] as soon as i went to dr google it scared
[35:02] me
[35:08] as soon as i went up
[35:10] i decided to go to the era
[35:26] so he said it was nothing to worry about
[35:29] [Music]
[35:31] and as uh
[35:33] as i was leaving the nurse said you
[35:35] better go get a you better go get a
[35:38] check by a specialist though because it
[35:39] could you know that could not be the
[35:41] case
[35:53] right around that time i was preparing
[35:54] to go to africa
[35:58] satan wanted me to just start thinking
[36:00] about that and fearing about that
[36:06] and i set the appointment with the
[36:08] specialists
[36:11] and for about a week i
[36:13] i
[36:14] all i did was kind of
[36:17] worry about that
[36:23] and
[36:24] i felt that something inside of me just
[36:26] said to rest on on these three words
[36:33] and it's i am here
[36:37] so
[36:38] i decided there i i forgot about it and
[36:41] i rested on that
[36:46] and this past week i had the meeting
[36:48] with the specialist
[36:54] and he confirmed that it was nothing to
[36:55] be worried about
[36:59] but
[37:00] god took it one step further
[37:04] and as he checked to see where it was
[37:12] god bless you
[37:22] amen thank you for the specialists to
[37:24] rachel brother justin for
[37:27] telling us and showing us what god has
[37:28] done in your life amen is is he great in

[37:36] part of the service
[37:39] where we are here to receive god's word
[37:41] amen

[58:05] into the word i hope you didn't you

[58:11] this is now this is my time now right
[58:13] so this is the end number two
[58:17] number i'd like to put a subtitle
[58:18] evidential preaching uh
[58:23] we pray that this is a blessing to you
[58:27] we're going to continue what we started
[58:28] there in in what we started in or for
[58:31] easter almost continue
[58:34] let's see where the lord takes us this
[58:35] morning
[58:37] matthew the 24th chapter in the third
[58:39] verse
[58:42] like this and as he sat upon the mount
[58:44] of olives
[58:45] the disciples came unto him privately
[58:47] saying
[58:49] tell us when shall these things be
[58:52] and what shall be the sign of thy coming
[58:55] and of the end of the world
[59:07] amen may god add his blessings to the
[59:09] reading of his word you may be seated
[59:14] what a thing it is when
[59:16] when we see the disciples asking this
[59:18] question
[59:21] you know there's three questions here
[59:24] but you can see that that
[59:26] they're
[59:27] connecting a couple of things here
[59:45] that's enough to cause a lot of anxiety
[59:50] yes or yes clc
[59:52] how many are awake this morning make
[59:54] sure we're awake understand
[59:55] help your neighbor if he starts to knock
[59:57] off
[59:58] his neighbor
[1:00:02] that's enough to cause a lot of anxiety
[1:00:04] right
[1:00:06] coming to the lord
[1:00:07] the end of the world
[1:00:09] oh my goodness
[1:00:11] that'll get us going yeah
[1:00:17] one of the things that we as humans have
[1:00:19] is that we are very vulnerable
[1:00:23] we're vulnerable in a lot of ways
[1:00:29] i don't care who you are you're
[1:00:31] vulnerable in some way
[1:00:33] you are not strong in every way
[1:00:37] no no you're not we all have our
[1:00:38] strengths we all have our weaknesses we
[1:00:40] are human beings
[1:00:43] but there are many phobias that they
[1:00:45] call or fears that control the people
[1:00:51] and one of those fears or phobias is
[1:00:53] called doomsday phobias
[1:01:06] [Music]
[1:01:08] me and then they're going to
[1:01:11] her
[1:01:14] scaredy cat
[1:01:16] doomsday he's afraid of doomsday
[1:01:19] yeah as much as we might act like we're
[1:01:22] not i'm human beings there's always
[1:01:25] something there that's in the back of
[1:01:27] our mind that
[1:01:28] that worries us a little bit
[1:01:32] am i talking to anybody here
[1:01:34] yeah oh yeah yeah some
[1:01:36] okay some more honest some are not in
[1:01:39] in 1938
[1:01:42] the
[1:01:43] the program and it was called war of the
[1:01:46] worlds
[1:01:49] it was broadcasted live
[1:01:52] and it was claiming that they were
[1:01:54] following an alien invasion in new york
[1:01:56] city
[1:01:59] i've ever heard of that in my life oh
[1:02:00] we've all heard about that
[1:02:04] like i said broadcasted live
[1:02:06] transmitting vivo there's aliens that
[1:02:08] have attacked the city
[1:02:10] now i believe it was orson welles it's
[1:02:12] such a good storyteller orson welles
[1:02:17] that it was as it was being broadcast
[1:02:20] throughout the whole united states
[1:02:25] people everywhere thought that this was
[1:02:28] really going on
[1:02:32] it caused mass hysteria
[1:02:36] and it showed how easily
[1:02:39] the masses can be manipulated
[1:02:44] we've seen that even through the
[1:02:45] pandemic right
[1:02:48] pandemia but but
[1:02:49] as you see this
[1:02:51] vest it shows that that the majority of
[1:02:54] the population in a moment's time
[1:02:59] can be swept up in a phobia
[1:03:03] now this is what we would call group
[1:03:05] thinking
[1:03:08] which is a documented phenomenon
[1:03:13] that occurs when when members of a group
[1:03:18] began to conform to the majority's
[1:03:21] opinion
[1:03:24] without critically evaluating
[1:03:27] information for themselves
[1:03:31] and we find that a lot nowadays
[1:03:34] is that right
[1:03:35] we don't check on things for ourselves
[1:03:39] that's why our founding pastor would
[1:03:41] always tell us
[1:03:56] but now that you've studied it
[1:04:00] there's nobody that's going to tell you
[1:04:01] that it's not true
[1:04:04] not a second-hand revelation
[1:04:08] revelation
[1:04:10] now think of this now because i remember
[1:04:12] when i was in in 1977
[1:04:17] i remember that the big talk was the
[1:04:19] rapture is going to happen this year
[1:04:24] remember that yeah that would that was
[1:04:25] the big thing right
[1:04:28] and and and i remember i was only five
[1:04:30] years old
[1:04:32] and uh yet there was a certain fear
[1:04:37] a certain
[1:04:38] anxiousness
[1:04:40] yet a certain excitement that was in the
[1:04:42] air
[1:04:45] that was amongst all the message
[1:04:47] believers of that time
[1:04:50] how do you process as a five-year-old
[1:04:53] the rapture is gonna happen
[1:04:58] i've been processing that through all my
[1:05:00] life
[1:05:02] but but how do you really process that
[1:05:06] and when i look at the young people i
[1:05:08] see many times that there is that that
[1:05:10] bit of anxiety that that comes along
[1:05:12] with hearing
[1:05:14] the end well
[1:05:19] so i i entitled the message last time
[1:05:21] and then this time this is the end
[1:05:25] so
[1:05:25] i want to know what kind of feelings you
[1:05:27] get when i say this is the end
[1:05:31] let me see if there's a young person
[1:05:33] that that is
[1:05:34] it is
[1:05:35] valiant
[1:05:37] has enough courage to stand up and say
[1:05:39] this is how i feel
[1:05:45] that's embarrassing
[1:05:52] it brings a lot of anxiety the brother
[1:05:55] is he's honest
[1:05:58] okay
[1:05:58] does any one of you agree with that with
[1:06:00] brother will algunas
[1:06:17] we look at that and we say
[1:06:19] the coming of the lord
[1:06:23] should be
[1:06:24] the greatest event
[1:06:27] that we have ever ever even imagined yes
[1:06:33] and yet
[1:06:34] it's too many people
[1:06:37] a point of
[1:06:38] of of like i said anxiety
[1:06:43] and we don't know how to process it
[1:06:44] sometimes
[1:06:46] so we we we automatically in our minds
[1:06:49] automatically
[1:06:51] we associate when i say the end we
[1:06:53] associate it with the end of the world
[1:06:55] association
[1:06:58] and we are not creatures that are good
[1:06:59] with dealing with the inn
[1:07:03] because as creatures of time
[1:07:06] when we speak of the end
[1:07:09] we automatically think a termination
[1:07:35] have a little anxiety when you hear of
[1:07:37] the end or
[1:07:38] doomsday or the end of the world
[1:07:52] it makes us
[1:07:54] think no
[1:07:56] that's right
[1:07:58] first thing we think about
[1:08:00] pennsylvania and naturally as humans
[1:08:04] like i said we we always associate the
[1:08:07] coming of the lord
[1:08:08] associated
[1:08:23] ah okay they're even even the disciples
[1:08:26] are worried about it
[1:08:29] and how we feel towards those two events
[1:08:33] usually tied to
[1:08:35] how we think we're doing spiritually
[1:08:42] yeah
[1:08:43] because right away oh there's a war
[1:08:45] going on open thomas
[1:08:46] this could be it
[1:08:48] could be world war iii
[1:08:54] right we ask ourselves those questions
[1:08:57] so many times
[1:08:59] and not just how we are doing
[1:09:01] spiritually
[1:09:04] how are we doing carnally
[1:09:08] and it makes us check ourselves as to
[1:09:10] who's been winning lately the white dog
[1:09:12] or the black dog
[1:09:13] is
[1:09:15] negro who's got the upper hand in my
[1:09:17] life right now
[1:09:31] now this is is is where we're going this
[1:09:35] morning
[1:09:37] because the bible says in philippians 4
[1:09:40] 6.
[1:09:41] in philippines and i want to take it as
[1:09:43] i said as a sunday school here
[1:09:46] philippians 6 says be careful
[1:09:49] or anxious for nothing
[1:09:54] so i have to stop there
[1:09:56] and i have to ask you the question
[1:09:58] those of you that say you get a little
[1:09:59] anxiety when you think about those
[1:10:01] things
[1:10:03] the bible says be anxious for nothing
[1:10:09] don't be anxious for the coming of the
[1:10:10] lord
[1:10:13] where even though we're anxious for it
[1:10:14] to come but don't be anxious in that
[1:10:17] you're you're worried about it
[1:10:20] and don't be anxious about the end of
[1:10:22] the world
[1:10:24] how many would believe me when i tell
[1:10:26] you that
[1:10:28] believe me
[1:10:39] and i believe that the reason people are
[1:10:41] so fearful and anxious about these
[1:10:43] subjects
[1:10:47] because they don't know a whole lot
[1:10:48] about the subjects
[1:10:53] okay so now i'm going to have to ask you
[1:10:55] young people
[1:10:57] how many how many uh if i asked you what
[1:11:00] do you know about the seventh seal
[1:11:08] brother paul help me out here
[1:11:12] you know anything about the seven seal
[1:11:16] come on
[1:11:19] rooting for you
[1:11:23] okay somebody else want to help
[1:11:25] us without you that young lady you're a
[1:11:27] young man anybody wanting
[1:11:29] anybody know anything about the seventh
[1:11:30] seal again

[1:11:38] tell me how
[1:11:39] i'll preach from right here
[1:11:42] hold on hold on brother
[1:11:46] and that's what i'm talking about
[1:11:49] because we hear things all the same oh
[1:11:50] that's too deep no i can't even mess
[1:11:52] with it i don't even go there
[1:11:56] now let me ask you another question
[1:11:59] if i were to ask you what do you know
[1:12:01] about the coming of the lord
[1:12:05] what would your answer be
[1:12:12] my eye
[1:12:17] what do you know about the community
[1:12:22] anybody anybody want to answer all did
[1:12:24] anybody answer
[1:12:30] and what if i told you it's the same
[1:12:32] question
[1:12:34] yes my
[1:12:36] because the seventh seal is the coming
[1:12:38] of the lord
[1:12:43] i want you to follow me where i'm going
[1:12:44] because i i want to do
[1:12:46] the holy spirit wants to do away with
[1:12:48] this anxiety
[1:12:52] we don't know i don't know i don't know
[1:12:53] what's going to happen i don't don't get
[1:12:55] to be anxious for nothing
[1:12:58] he's trying to help you this morning
[1:13:01] same question
[1:13:17] will come yes
[1:13:18] and when he will come juan dobendra
[1:13:22] ah okay now now now let me ask you this
[1:13:25] question now
[1:13:27] okay i want you one of you guys to
[1:13:29] answer me you haven't answered a
[1:13:30] question for me yet no no man responded

[1:13:41] yeah
[1:13:43] three times christmas is that right
[1:13:46] okay i wanna know the three times that
[1:13:49] he comes somebody anybody wanna help me
[1:13:50] out
[1:13:52] i'm gonna get you young people and you
[1:13:54] can make sure you know what you believe
[1:14:09] go ahead
[1:14:11] right there on the tip here
[1:14:17] this first coming is
[1:14:20] that who come and he redeemed his bride
[1:14:22] amen
[1:14:23] ah okay
[1:14:25] because we got to understand then what
[1:14:26] coming are you talking about
[1:14:29] here's the the disciples saying what
[1:14:31] shall be the sign of thy coming
[1:14:35] he's like well i'm here right now
[1:14:38] and there's still two more comings i
[1:14:55] okay
[1:14:56] then the second coming somebody helped
[1:14:58] me so the first one was to redeem his
[1:15:00] bride
[1:15:02] the second one would be
[1:15:05] he's coming for his bride in a rapture
[1:15:16] now if you're writing notes write this
[1:15:18] down
[1:15:20] first to redeem his bride
[1:15:51] and now the third he comes with his
[1:15:53] bride
[1:15:55] as the incarnate god
[1:15:57] incarnate
[1:16:01] immortal
[1:16:02] incarnate incarnate we have to know
[1:16:05] these things
[1:16:07] how many got that so far
[1:16:09] i'll give you a chance to finish writing
[1:16:10] that
[1:16:12] because if i run and then you guys don't
[1:16:13] get it and what good is it that i'm up
[1:16:15] here preaching and got everybody excited
[1:16:17] and we were dancing and it was awesome
[1:16:31] all right so you guys got that hello all
[1:16:33] right let's let's go on then continue
[1:16:37] in verse 3
[1:16:39] that's once again
[1:16:41] they're concerned about his coming
[1:16:44] and then about the end of the world
[1:16:48] i'm going to recap a little bit here
[1:16:51] jesus continues in verse 14.
[1:16:56] and he begins to refocus their attention
[1:17:00] to another end a otrofin
[1:17:06] an end that they're missing the point i
[1:17:09] wouldn't find on the list
[1:17:10] this is the whole this is the whole crux
[1:17:13] of the message now
[1:17:24] this message will take all the anxiety
[1:17:26] out of it
[1:17:29] but you gotta follow me pinch yourself
[1:17:32] because after about a few minutes 20
[1:17:34] minutes 30 minutes you start to wander
[1:17:35] off and oh
[1:17:38] boy was looking at me yesterday
[1:17:49] hey
[1:17:50] gotta get your attention back again
[1:17:53] pay attention
[1:18:00] maybe i hit a wrong note
[1:18:05] but that's why we have the anxiety
[1:18:08] i'm nervous about everything okay we're
[1:18:10] this
[1:18:25] end
[1:18:26] now now this is verse 14 now
[1:18:29] and this gospel of the kingdom yes
[1:18:33] shall be preached in all the worlds
[1:18:37] or a witness what a testimony
[1:18:45] now this is what i said the other day
[1:18:48] i always my mind automatically did this
[1:18:52] then shall the end come in
[1:18:55] and i thought right away then shall the
[1:18:57] end of the world happen
[1:19:00] the gospel of the kingdom
[1:19:02] preached
[1:19:04] then the holy spirit says no yeah
[1:19:19] because as creatures of time
[1:19:34] [Music]
[1:19:35] what happens to my soul my spirit what
[1:19:37] happens to me
[1:19:39] is that the end of it
[1:19:41] ah here he here watch as jesus then is
[1:19:44] refocusing them to the end jesus
[1:19:48] because
[1:19:49] the end of the world
[1:19:52] that word as i said and would you put it
[1:19:54] up there it's soon to leia
[1:19:57] however you want to now pronounce it
[1:20:01] is the end of the
[1:20:02] world it is the entire completion or
[1:20:05] consummation of everything
[1:20:11] but jesus never said
[1:20:14] that when the gospel of the kingdom has
[1:20:16] been preached in all the world
[1:20:19] end of the world will happen
[1:20:22] there is an end that will happen before
[1:20:25] the end of europe
[1:20:27] and this end is what we are talking
[1:20:29] about today
[1:20:43] talks about the end or the telos
[1:20:47] how many know that that how many
[1:20:49] remember that what we talked about on
[1:20:50] easter
[1:20:52] now notice this now the endor talos
[1:20:56] is the end of some act
[1:21:09] in other words time continues
[1:21:21] but it's the last in any succession of
[1:21:23] series
[1:21:26] it is the point at which
[1:21:29] a time being
[1:21:33] can come into eternity
[1:21:39] this is a different end now i'm telling
[1:21:41] you watch this now
[1:21:43] which a thing is finished
[1:21:48] it is the end to which all things relate
[1:21:53] aim the purpose el
[1:22:01] the intentional actualization of
[1:22:03] potential or inherent
[1:22:05] purpose
[1:22:07] intentional the
[1:22:13] now this is why jesus is now telling
[1:22:15] them
[1:22:17] that the end of the world
[1:22:21] cannot come
[1:22:28] and he's telling them you're so worried
[1:22:30] about the end of the world
[1:22:33] and you should be worried about the end
[1:23:18] in all the world for a witness unto all
[1:23:20] nations
[1:23:23] and my question is
[1:23:25] why is there such a push today to stop
[1:23:28] preaching
[1:23:37] if god didn't call somebody to preach
[1:23:39] god bless them i'm not i'm not against
[1:23:41] anybody that don't preach
[1:23:45] but if you're called to do that
[1:23:48] the gospel of the kingdom
[1:23:51] has been preached
[1:23:53] in all the world
[1:23:55] then shall the end come in
[1:23:59] without preaching of the gospel there is
[1:24:02] no actualization of the divine purpose
[1:24:05] of god no actually
[1:24:10] i'll tell you why people have a lot of
[1:24:11] hard time nowadays with preachers
[1:24:26] right
[1:24:40] it makes them a good preacher
[1:24:50] but i want you to notice something
[1:24:52] it's not just about preaching no solo is
[1:24:56] the predicate because if it's
[1:25:23] sometimes we preach and we it's hard to
[1:25:25] get one person to come to the lord
[1:25:26] nowadays
[1:25:29] but i want you to get this this morning
[1:25:32] this gospel of the kingdom shall be
[1:25:36] preached esteban hello there i know
[1:25:50] this is what we would call evidential
[1:26:20] that can help take away the anxiety
[1:26:23] bring the people to an understanding
[1:26:27] we are not the same just as any anybody
[1:26:29] that goes to church
[1:26:31] god has a calling he's got a purpose
[1:26:46] even though an evidential preacher can
[1:26:48] get you excited
[1:26:51] there's a balance here now we understand
[1:26:53] that now watch this now
[1:26:55] it's not just that we're preaching
[1:26:58] because they think that because they
[1:26:59] have the books and the bibles and the
[1:27:01] tapes and all these things
[1:27:20] i'm not just talking about gospel i'm
[1:27:22] talking about evidential preaching
[1:27:26] evidence lots of preachers everywhere
[1:27:28] you turn but
[1:27:30] you can get any kind
[1:27:42] you may be giving the people the word he
[1:27:44] says
[1:27:57] watch where we're going this morning
[1:28:00] because the gospel is the power of god
[1:28:05] yes it is
[1:28:06] to make the word act
[1:28:12] what it says it will
[1:28:48] this is why we need evidential preaching
[1:28:51] right now
[1:28:54] we have heard it
[1:29:23] that's why such a tremendous thing that
[1:29:24] i had never seen before
[1:29:27] when three
[1:29:28] pastors were ordained as ministers of
[1:29:31] this end-time message in uganda
[1:29:36] the fields
[1:29:44] got their own little agenda doing their
[1:29:46] own little thing
[1:29:49] nobody cares about the harvest so much
[1:29:51] anymore
[1:29:53] oh whoever is going to come in is going
[1:29:54] to come in oh well
[1:29:57] what an attitude yeah
[1:29:59] if we could really understand what jesus
[1:30:01] is saying
[1:30:04] this
[1:30:22] because god don't see the end as an oh
[1:30:24] my goodness the end's coming
[1:30:28] finn
[1:30:31] we're supposed to think like him
[1:30:34] and yet we think like the world
[1:30:37] oh what's happening oh my gosh what am i
[1:30:39] going to do
[1:30:40] i'm worried all the time
[1:30:43] we said in church time after time
[1:30:45] the question is are you not getting the
[1:30:47] evidential preaching
[1:30:51] maybe we gotta bring it down a little
[1:30:53] bit more
[1:30:55] every attribute
[1:30:57] every thought
[1:30:59] that was in god from before the
[1:31:01] foundation of the world
[1:31:04] will come to its full and complete
[1:31:06] manifestation
[1:31:08] a complete manifesto in the end or the
[1:31:11] telos
[1:31:14] that's right
[1:31:17] first peter 1 10.
[1:31:20] now follow me
[1:31:22] from what i said from the very beginning
[1:31:24] follow it to right now as we keep
[1:31:25] continue on this
[1:31:29] he's not telling you to be worried about
[1:31:31] the ant the end of the world
[1:31:34] you got to get to perfection
[1:31:40] that's the end
[1:31:41] watch his first peter one let's go to
[1:31:44] let's go to verse 12.
[1:31:46] unto whom it was revealed that
[1:31:49] not unto i'm going to read it just in
[1:31:51] english to save a little bit of time
[1:31:52] unto whom it was revealed that not unto
[1:31:54] themselves but unto us they did minister
[1:31:58] the things
[1:31:59] which are now reported unto you
[1:32:02] by them that have preached the gospel
[1:32:05] unto you
[1:32:06] with the holy ghost
[1:32:08] sent down from heaven
[1:32:10] which things the angels desire to look
[1:32:14] into
[1:32:17] what are the angels desiring to look
[1:32:19] into que de san ver los angeles they
[1:32:22] could just see what was in that what's
[1:32:23] in that heart
[1:32:33] but this is what i want to get to verse
[1:32:34] 13.
[1:32:36] wherefore gird up the loins of your mind
[1:32:44] or just letting the wind just
[1:32:47] take you from here to there
[1:32:50] and i'm worried
[1:32:51] i'm
[1:32:52] anxious and i'm depressed and i'm
[1:32:54] everything else
[1:32:57] gird up the loins of your mind
[1:33:00] you get me young people look look at the
[1:33:02] coins of your mind
[1:34:14] because your redemption is
[1:34:28] to the end of the world no to the end
[1:34:39] i like this hope to the end for the
[1:34:41] grace
[1:34:43] that is to be brought unto you
[1:34:46] at the revelation of jesus christ
[1:34:52] it's not a mystery no more
[1:34:54] mysterious what was once a mystery has
[1:34:56] now been opened
[1:34:57] when mysterio
[1:35:12] so don't be fearful or anxious
[1:35:15] wait with joy
[1:35:17] and full confidence
[1:35:19] for your perfection
[1:35:22] your maturity
[1:35:23] your completeness
[1:35:26] that is
[1:35:55] revelations 22 16 apocalypses
[1:35:58] he says i jesus your jesus have sent
[1:36:02] my angels
[1:36:05] to testify
[1:36:07] unto you
[1:36:09] i don't think we understand sometimes
[1:36:12] how great a message that we have
[1:36:14] recently
[1:36:16] i jesus have sent mine angel jesus
[1:36:20] to testify unto you
[1:36:22] testimony brother branham interprets the
[1:36:23] word testify there
[1:36:27] he says i jesus have sent
[1:36:29] mine angel
[1:36:31] to vindicate
[1:36:35] oh come on church i sent my angel to
[1:36:38] vindicate it unto you
[1:36:42] vindication is the evidence of the
[1:36:45] preaching that we are supposed to be
[1:36:46] doing
[1:36:50] his
[1:37:15] imputation
[1:37:40] this message is incredible
[1:37:43] and there's so many today's oh this
[1:37:45] message
[1:37:46] is
[1:38:15] that we have evidence now
[1:38:20] i don't know about you but we've got
[1:38:22] evidence here
[1:38:24] that's the message that was brought to
[1:38:26] us by the seventh angels
[1:38:29] to regain
[1:38:30] possession of what was ours from the
[1:38:33] beginning
[1:38:35] of the principle why jesus never gave us
[1:38:38] our inheritance
[1:38:41] god gave us our inheritance before the
[1:38:42] foundation
[1:38:56] while he was here on earth
[1:38:58] when he ascended on highs
[1:39:00] then he comes back regresa the son of
[1:39:03] man is revealed again
[1:39:07] revealed again what does he do
[1:39:10] he goes and
[1:39:51] now this this gets personal with you and
[1:39:52] the lord
[1:40:01] hello
[1:40:02] that's an invitation
[1:40:07] this vindication
[1:40:10] that the angel brought
[1:40:12] will defend you against any opposition
[1:40:18] we know we lived
[1:40:23] when the message of this angel has found
[1:40:25] its place in you
[1:40:29] there is no reason to worry about the
[1:40:31] end
[1:40:33] christ in us is
[1:40:40] i don't know how to make it any planer
[1:40:43] i am alpha and i am omega alpha omega
[1:40:47] i'm the beginning
[1:41:11] put on that clip
[1:41:13] if you don't believe me here's another
[1:41:15] there's another preacher
[1:41:44] in spanish it's always masculine
[1:41:48] when you go live
[1:41:49] when you go learn spanish it's always
[1:41:52] feminine
[1:41:54] now i do don't want you to to to get the
[1:41:57] scripture out of context
[1:42:01] because only jesus solomon jesus is the
[1:42:05] i is the alpha and the omega alpha
[1:42:09] omega that is his attribute is the song
[1:42:40] if
[1:42:50] glory
[1:42:51] gloria
[1:42:56] i could get the microphone and drop it
[1:42:58] and say god bless you well they had a
[1:43:00] microphone
[1:43:01] that's enough right
[1:43:04] but what a statement
[1:43:06] go back i i tell you go back and hear
[1:43:07] that again like yes good
[1:43:09] the tommy junior in in the message alpha
[1:43:11] and omega tommy jr
[1:43:13] wonderful
[1:43:15] matthew 24 14 is evidential preaching
[1:43:20] can only come by the message of this
[1:43:22] angelo
[1:43:50] but
[1:43:52] god sends a prophet
[1:43:56] signs and wonders are given to that
[1:43:58] prophet to vindicate his ministry
[1:44:03] number three then the word of god comes
[1:44:05] to the prophet
[1:44:08] and the prophet vindicates that word
[1:44:14] a prophet is a revealer of the word
[1:44:16] that's written
[1:44:37] oh come on is that anybody here
[1:44:39] come on now there has to be a people
[1:44:41] then
[1:44:42] that are born of that word
[1:45:01] said mano i thought that only god that
[1:45:03] god only vindicates his prophets
[1:45:06] prophet let me tell you
[1:45:09] no no
[1:45:10] he wants to vindicate you too el steele
[1:45:16] he already proved that brother branham
[1:45:17] was a prophet
[1:45:20] who wants to say he's not he's not the
[1:45:22] prophet
[1:45:28] but i think is looking up yes i don't
[1:45:30] care what anybody has to say
[1:45:32] but he's already been vindicated
[1:45:35] but here's the problem okay and i'm just
[1:45:37] giving you the problem
[1:45:39] but i want to give you the answer too
[1:45:40] let's wait a little question it's easy
[1:45:42] to find out what the problems are
[1:45:47] this is wrong in the church and this is
[1:45:48] wrong
[1:45:52] about it and talking about it with each
[1:45:53] other
[1:45:56] shame on us when we do that
[1:45:58] our little clicks in our little groups
[1:46:03] don't even get me going right now in
[1:46:04] that one
[1:46:06] [Music]
[1:46:09] you say brother
[1:46:23] as the product of that word
[1:46:30] here's a pear
[1:46:32] that's an orange tree like a stone
[1:46:34] i can't vindicate that nope
[1:46:37] no
[1:46:38] oh
[1:46:52] here's the new birth
[1:46:54] at the revelation of jesus christ
[1:46:58] watch what he says here in the message
[1:46:59] he must be born again if you can put it
[1:47:01] up there and and mental is necessary
[1:47:03] when you're born again
[1:47:06] not
[1:47:43] that's how god vindicates all of his
[1:47:46] nature
[1:47:52] that's the way he vindicates his
[1:47:54] ministry is a minister all of his
[1:47:57] servants are vindicated the same way he
[1:48:00] vindicates nature
[1:48:16] how
[1:48:30] how do you know he's a teacher
[1:48:32] because the word comes from him
[1:48:35] how do you know he's a prophet
[1:48:36] the word comes through him
[1:48:40] vindication it proves itself indication
[1:48:43] but as the generations pass and here's
[1:48:46] where we come into a little problem here
[1:48:50] generations pass
[1:48:54] little by little forget
[1:48:55] poco
[1:48:57] had sent a vindicated
[1:49:11] that was brought through that prophetic
[1:49:54] he began to forget about the prophet and
[1:49:56] his message
[1:49:59] and now
[1:50:00] everything sounds good
[1:50:07] it's easier to get on tick
[1:50:09] mas facidentara tick-tock and listen to
[1:50:12] 30 seconds
[1:50:14] of a preacher going to town
[1:50:18] oh man he's got the anointing
[1:50:32] hello everybody
[1:50:34] i listened to over here when i just got
[1:50:37] at the oral roberts and the billy graham
[1:50:40] or robert that's the congratulational
[1:50:41] seed
[1:50:46] that's a pentecostal scene
[1:50:50] it'll grow watch it
[1:50:52] it's going to grow
[1:50:55] but the word see will also grow
[1:51:00] i jesus has sent mine angel jesus
[1:51:03] not a bunch of preachers no no
[1:51:44] and because people began to lose sight
[1:51:55] there's a lot of truth in those things
[1:51:56] i'm not i'm not against them
[1:51:58] but you don't understand this you say
[1:52:00] well why do you bring it up so much
[1:52:01] because it's a it's a subject that's
[1:52:02] ongoing
[1:52:05] they're my brothers i'm not against them
[1:52:08] we should hear more
[1:52:11] get back to the hearing the message of
[1:52:12] the hour
[1:52:28] evidential preachers
[1:52:34] therefore
[1:52:35] now
[1:52:36] i may make a lot of people even in the
[1:52:38] message throw up for this
[1:52:42] it was good until that point
[1:52:45] therefore
[1:52:47] that word esta must be re-vindicated
[1:52:53] you might not like that
[1:52:57] god already vindicated the pride he
[1:52:58] don't need to be revindicated
[1:53:03] give me a chance to say what i got to
[1:53:05] say
[1:53:19] well they're choking out they're working
[1:53:20] to be drinking
[1:53:27] so good
[1:53:29] i wish i could give you all some
[1:53:31] but if you need some acidic just raise
[1:53:33] your hand say dick and i need some water
[1:53:35] yeah
[1:53:36] i don't know about this re-vindication
[1:53:37] thing
[1:53:45] i'm not saying that you have to go
[1:53:46] re-vindicate who brother no watch how
[1:53:48] i'm saying this
[1:53:50] that's the only way to re-vindicate it
[1:54:06] god he is the god of brother all these
[1:54:09] precious brothers that gave their life
[1:54:11] el dios estos hermanos
[1:54:13] got to be vindicated in our day now
[1:54:17] because then all they have is just
[1:54:19] stories
[1:54:34] continue
[1:55:02] that they
[1:55:09] not for us just to sit down and say wow
[1:55:11] that was tremendous i'd use them
[1:55:15] we would not be where we're at without
[1:55:25] oh can i have like 15 minutes
[1:55:28] i don't know how long but
[1:55:30] but let me let me get this okay
[1:55:34] this this is just tremendous to me
[1:55:37] it's up to us it's depending on the
[1:55:40] evidential preaching
[1:55:42] evidence
[1:56:36] then you and christ are one
[1:56:39] god and christ are one
[1:56:53] himself alive after 2000
[1:57:01] [Applause]
[1:57:06] now once the angel has vindicated what
[1:57:09] jesus said
[1:57:12] it's our turn to vindicate
[1:57:14] what we have heard
[1:57:22] oh it's a good message brother
[1:57:24] hermano
[1:57:26] good piece of meat
[1:57:31] you manifest
[1:57:34] or is it just a good message
[1:57:36] we're not
[1:57:45] the people had to believe what moses
[1:57:47] spoke
[1:57:50] but then it was up to the people to
[1:57:52] vindicate
[1:57:54] or produce a claim
[1:57:58] of what moses had
[1:58:01] says that it was of god
[1:58:44] this is what he told the man to brother
[1:58:45] omar i hope i get it right
[1:58:49] omar you believe that message chris
[1:58:56] you cannot deny what you all are doing
[1:58:59] not what it has been no pues
[1:59:27] these great men left the legacy
[1:59:31] i remember when it was so dark it seemed
[1:59:33] when my father got sick
[1:59:35] i said this is the past
[1:59:37] this is the end
[1:59:42] it was pretty much the end of my world
[1:59:44] era
[1:59:46] but it was not the end yet
[1:59:49] you know why
[1:59:50] because i had to do the same thing in my
[1:59:52] generation
[1:59:55] i thank god for a good wife

[2:00:11] brothers the church the ministers
