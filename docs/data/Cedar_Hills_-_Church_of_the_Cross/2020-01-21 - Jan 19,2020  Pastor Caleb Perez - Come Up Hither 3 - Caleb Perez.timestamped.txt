[32:54] somebody else
[32:57] with the fashions of the world and with
[33:02] the enticements that the world has given
[33:05] to things just like this if you go to
[33:10] school and some of the new girls wear a
[33:13] certain loose strocker dress or whatever
[33:16] you would call it all the ambition the
[33:20] rest of school has is the pattern after
[33:22] that girl
[33:25] some of the women see on the television
[33:27] some certain lady come out dressed in a
[33:31] certain fashion well that's their
[33:33] ambition is to dress and act like that
[33:37] [Music]
[33:40] and that seems to be just about the
[33:42] limit of the American ambition is to get
[33:48] a new job or to get a raise in your
[33:50] salary and to get a television or a new
[33:54] car
[33:57] let me say this those things may be all
[34:02] right but there's higher ambitions in
[34:05] the human life than those things and
[34:10] Christian should set their affection on
[34:13] higher ambition I think it would pay us
[34:20] all to sit down and wonder why we are
[34:23] here in the first place and who was kind
[34:29] enough to bring us here we are two
[34:33] considered and asked him what he would
[34:37] have us to do the purpose of us coming
[34:40] to fulfill what he has purpose for us
[34:45] but we seem to be just wanting to keep
[34:50] up with the world now the Bible said
[34:54] that we can overcome the world
[34:59] and how do we do it Papa keeping up with
[35:03] the fashions of the world but the Bible
[35:09] said that faith is the victory that
[35:13] overcomes the world
[35:16] [Music]
[35:36] amen
[35:37] faith is our victory a man faced and as

[1:11:37] understand what it is but here's where
[1:11:40] many times the problem lies there are
[1:11:43] key Sunday is canceled el problema I
[1:11:44] gotta make sure you don't forget the
[1:11:46] first part of the message no shielding
[1:11:47] la première but you cannot become one as
[1:11:50] long as your hands are on the steering
[1:11:51] wheel way I said whoo no means this was
[1:11:53] not letting go here tell us this
[1:11:56] the problem a crystal problem we know
[1:11:58] that God deals with Israel as a nation
[1:12:00] Seattle's is commune and accion and he
[1:12:03] deals with Gentile the Gentiles as
[1:12:06] individual economist cantinas were in in
[1:12:08] the complement is Wireless amen but this
[1:12:12] is why many people will say is to look
[1:12:14] in which a hint it is saying I don't
[1:12:15] need no one else no necesito another in
[1:12:18] man I deal with God as an individual
[1:12:20] okay only they open doors in these do a
[1:12:21] lamenting come when davido watch there's

[1:12:30] continuity with the word he McKenna
[1:12:32] continued on come on so again that's why
[1:12:34] many people say I don't need nobody else
[1:12:37] can we charge entity known as you see I
[1:12:39] am an individual so an individual and
[1:12:42] God deals with me personal usually there
[1:12:44] can we go personal may man and I don't
[1:12:46] doubt that you know who do is we are all
[1:12:49] individuals so so most individual
[1:12:51] salvation is an individual affair
[1:12:55] salvation is an individual affair we're
[1:12:59] saved as individuals so most of us
[1:13:01] community videos but if you stay as an
[1:13:03] individual versus a carrot commune
