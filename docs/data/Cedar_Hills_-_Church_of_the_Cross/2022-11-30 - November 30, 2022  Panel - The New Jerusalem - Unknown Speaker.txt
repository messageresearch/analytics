got there safely and on our way back we started traveling back in El Camino De regreso Pandora and keep in mind I was tandem pulling uh which for those of you that don't know what that is I was towing two trailers at the same time and we're traveling at night yes and I could see ahead of me that somebody had just ran over a javelina yes a really big so I veered to my left lane so that I wouldn't hit it and I didn't feel anything I didn't feel like if I ran it over or you know and it was like I said it was late at night so we just went to bed as soon as we got home in the morning when I woke up I went to unload my truck and unhitch the trailers and I noticed a big piece of bone sticking out of my tires on the sidewall it's probably about almost three inches long yes and he told me man

pastors as always for the confidence to to be able to study his word and try to try to impart something to to his people amen famous does brother Benji mentioned we're going to be uh the topic we have uh today is the New Jerusalem um and I don't know about you guys but I I really I enjoyed I enjoyed studying this topic I don't know about you but Dan brother will brother Jerry no serious it was it was uh it was a big eye-opener and and you know there's a lot of things that go along with this and you sometimes you don't realize how how deep a subject is until you really start jumping into it and then and then you get kind of lost but but uh so we want to kind of start out today and I'm just going to kind of go real briefly into um you know the New Jerusalem where is it found in the Bible so um you can if everyone will turn their Bibles Revolution Revelations 21 when you drop people almost um and it uh and it reads like this we'll just start with verse one and two because it's basically the large majority of this chapter is describing the New Jerusalem and so forth okay so we'll just read one in queue real quick to start here and it reads like this and I saw a new Heaven and a new Earth for the first Heaven and the first Earth were passed away and there was no more seats and I John saw the holy city New Jerusalem coming down from God out of Heaven prepared as a bride adorned for her husband is and I want you to pay attention to that second verse and and remember the fact that everything in the Bible has a compound meaning okay and there's there's a number of places in the Bible where you find the the New Jerusalem mentioned [Music] Hebrews chapter 12 verse 22 everybody else The Book of John 14 verse 2 and 3. uh Isaiah 65 18-19 Hebrews 11 verse 10 is and many many other places in the Bible where where the Bible speaks of or talks in in relation to the New Jerusalem so what we want to do tonight is take take the New Jerusalem to start off with in the natural sense because the New Jerusalem it will it will be a city right guys it's actually going to be a place and it also has another meaning that we'll we'll get to as we go here in the in the spiritual sense so I'm going to ask brother will uh in the Book of Revelations can you can you give us the the New Jerusalem its description as the Bible gives it to us yeah brother Carlos said it uh it was a uh I'm sure awesome uh studying about this and I think it's uh when you're with these panels it's it's great when you study by yourself but when you're studying with with the other brothers as we win that's that's what it brings out a lot a lot of a lot of light for your for yourself excuse me so we're gonna uh be talking a little bit uh what the a little bit of the description of what the New Jerusalem is and I want you to to for for a minute here try and imagine a a place um that is as the Bible will say it's it's 12 000 furlongs and I want you to keep in mind the number 12. as we as we know the number 12 is worship so the number 12 plays uh quite a big role when we when we talk about uh about the New Jerusalem um so when we when we see the the dimensions of 12 000 furlongs and what we know um of of our measurements is equal to 1500 miles yes so when the Bible says it's 1500 miles wide the angel It's 1500 miles in length is what's what's incredible about this too is that it's 1500 miles so imagine something as as massive as this I mean I can't even fathom this honestly can you put the uh put the uh uh picture of the U.S up on the map here so if you would if you would uh so that would be 1500 miles so as you see with stretch from Canada into Mexico hasta Mexico from California there's the California to Missouri Illinois that area Illinois so imagine a place in my Altura it's three point almost 3.8 million square miles if you would if you would maybe uh look at it as a as a as a building I guess you can say see and if you would measure each each story as 12 feet it would be equal to 600 000 stories pisos now this city this city is as you can see it's just so massive Grande once again we're going to go to the number 12. and we're going to talk about stones and when you when you see what what the walls first of all are made of the Bible says that the wall is made of Jasper the walls had 12 foundations fundamentals and in the names of the foundations where the names of the 12 tribes of Israel and in them the names of the 12 apostles so if you can imagine how how big these walls are the Bible describes them as the these walls are 144 cubits thick this is 144 cubits thick so that's 216 feet thick so doses um so you so we see you know we were as as we were discussing um the walls and the dimensions and all that you know uh the Bible starts with uh with these Stones here and we're going to get into those right now the First Foundation was Jasper El primer fundamental I can put the that is that this is actually the the German so this so so the German the urum and thumb in every everyone knows kind of what that is right but but uh they are they are stones and and these Stones if uh were were significant to to the children of Israel now these were precious stones stones in general were very very precious to the children if they go into Joshua four nine we can see what these Stones were for and why the Bible was using stones uh Joshua 4 9 . actually let's start with uh with verse uh verse 3. and command ye them saying take your hands out of the midst of Jordan out of the place where the priest feet stood 12 Stones and ye shall carry them over with you and leave them in the lodging place where ye shall Lodge this night Las cuales was then Joshua called the 12 men whom he had prepared of the children of Israel out of every tribe a man trivo and Joshua said unto them pass over before the Ark of the Lord your God in the midst of Jordan and take you up every man you a stone upon his shoulder according to the number of tribes of the children of Israel news Israel verse 6 that this may be a sign among you amen that when your children ask their fathers in time to come saying what mean ye by these stones so these Stones they were meant as a memorial so when you see Elijah as he's building his Altar and as as all those prophets come against him he also makes an altar of 12 Stones amen amen so the walls of of this New Jerusalem they had 12 foundations fundamentos and like we said before the foundations were of the tribes of Israel and the and the Twelve Apostles fundamentos is so you can see that it's something with the old testamento with the tribes and also the New Testament with the apostles so let's go to the stones now these are what we call precious stones what's amazing about these precious stones is that did we know did you know that Lucifer also had precious songs Lucifer had precious stones but he only had nine minutes this New Jerusalem is a significant because it's worship adoration the First Foundation was Jasper El primer fundamentura the second Foundation was Sapphire El Segundo zafiro the third was calcidoni Agata the fourth was emeralda the fifth was excuse me look the sixth is logo so as you see Como vemos these Stones is they were set up into into four rows Cuatros uh three letters all right so when you see these walls well these walls also have to have uh they also have to have Gates now as the Bible says each gate was of pearl amen amen so so you're thinking well it's made of of a bunch of pearls yes well it's made up of Perla in in 2018 they they ended up selling the world's largest pearl at the vendironment it was known as the sleeping lion so they sold it for three hundred and seventy four thousand dollars the largest pearl that we have to this day 5.4 ounces yes and it's 2.75 inches long yes so imagine that guy yeah yeah that's going to be yeah that's going to be a small game right yeah we're gonna need a big big big big pearl right exactly so this gate esta Puerta it has to be something spiritual it has to be something Supernatural because you can't find this on the earth it reminds me of the story of the pearl of great price amen Yes Man how many pearl of great prices do we have here we're we're not something insignificant I mean this if you look at it in a way brother Jerry this is our home is there was there was no I want to say no expense spared in this place I mean you you you have a place that's that's that's of gold um you're walking down uh uh streets of gold of Jasper oh uh and not just not just a gold that we see now but it's it's gold you can actually just see through transparent transparent gold that's right and oh my goodness what what a place oh that is this isn't something that's a fairy tale this is something that is actual that is that is that is tangible I have a question yes sir did he not say that I go to prepare a place for you so on this and we'll hear about it more when we talk about the on the Millennium I will have to build keep in mind that in this city we don't have to lift the fingers in this city God himself has built the city so like so we'll hear about that a little bit more go ahead brother so when you say God has built the city brother it reminds me of the of the of the of the the quote that we read right brother Dan about about the Divine Architects and we we find out and brother Branham describes this so beautifully he is because he talks about God who is the Divine architect of the New Jerusalem architect and brother Brown says oh what will it look like did you ever think now bride oh no what will it look like he says it's prepared and designed by the Divine Architects then he says the Divine architect has prepared it designed it doesn't he say that he designed it according to her touch that's exactly right in the next quote here yeah brother Branham says can you imagine a man marrying a wife that's able get he how he builds and puts every little thing just exactly to her touches just what she would like exactly now the Divine architect has designed the new city that's where he says it but Jerry says where he will live with his bride just to her touch eyes so just when you think that maybe you don't matter or that you're not significant enough there's a Divine architect that considered everything that you like yeah there's no expense no the greatest pearl of great price the finest gold the most beautiful diamonds in gems brother danosas golden walkways brother will a River of Life flowing from the midst of it all just the way each and every one of you like it is whatever little thing that you like it waits for us there now because that Divine architect architecture he built it for us amen so so isn't that tremendous and guys that's just the natural City that's just the natural part is so brother Jerry can you can you tell us about the first Redemption the cleansing of the earth as we start directing ourselves over into the spiritual aspect of it is you see both parts here we see that the Earth has to be redeemed just like we have to right A lot of times we think that all this is going to happen all at once just like the Rapture oh when does The Rapture happen brother we've been in the Rapture all this time so the building of the city brother branches has been going on for thousands of years already but you see the the parallels how they run we know that the Earth had to be baptized through the stages of Grace you have to go through sanctification justification sanctification certification baptism of the Holy Ghost so you see how they run parallel there is so as we speak in all this whether it be the natural or the spiritual yes remember how we always say put your thinking caps on always remember that spiritual aspect of it so I asked I asked her pastor Pastor because I I so there's a question right the New Jerusalem and Zion how can you separate them you know what's the difference well he said in all reality you can't separate them that's why I wanted to use with the Earth being purified along with a Believers so we can't separate these things so keep that in mind okay man that's right so we we find you know the the Earth has to go through a purification right just like the bra just like the bride we have to go through the purification process you know to to understand that so we it it takes us it takes us to to a word brother Danny the brother Branham uses right Danny can you can you what was that word that that that brother Branham uh used thank you that is yes sir yesterday can you can you tell us kind of what what that what that meant there is to go past is or to pass by uh of persons moving forward personas is an act continuing for a Time continuance right man or to pass away right so what's the changing right that's right so how are we going to get to a New Jerusalem right so it's got to be something new the Bible says if any man be in Christ Jesus Christ Jesus he is a new creature is right that's right and so so just talking naturally a little bit so as Brother Carlos just said and or brother Jerry just said and as he was talking to the pastor okay so this is kind of important so I want to read this because a lot of a lot of this that we're talking about it's a lot of mathematical right a lot of dimensions and sizes how many are interested you want to go that's my home yes sir so how many like where you live uh it depends on where you're living right if you're if you're living in Christ where we're living right the life that we're living right so all of this can get a little confusing so just a natural sense let's so Zechariah 8 3 says it says thus say it the Lord yes it is I have returned to Zion and I will dwell in the midst of Jerusalem you can't separate nothing here and Jerusalem shall be called the city of Truth in the mountain of the Lord of hosts the holy mountains so Jerusalem Jerusalem is mentioned 813 times this is just Jerusalem okay so it's mentioned 813 times in the Bible Well 670 times in the old testamentes 143 times in the new testamento more than any other place in both books so that's just natural Jerusalem right Jesus we're talking about New Jerusalem though so it's the New Jerusalem a place yes sir is it a place how many here say it's a place not everybody's short right so is it a persona persona yes sir yes or maybe getting a little confused quick question so in the natural it's mentioned 813 times more than any other city in the book so if it's a person then that's how much God thinks about it right so when the natural God God of Christ through David he said oh Jerusalem Jerusalem how oft would I have hovered over you yeah was he talking about a place of dirt oh Jerusalem Jerusalem oh New Jerusalem so that's just natural right yes I don't want to take too much more time read this quote because like I said it's confusing so how many knows what the news we've already been talking about it so how many knows what the New Jerusalem is how many are sure bye everybody that says it's a place say yes amen everybody that says it's the person say Amen so this is our founding pastor pastor I was talking to a preacher and he said oh it will be nice when we get to the Millennium to inhabit the new city watch that uh well let me let me slow down okay oh it will be nice when we get to the Millennium to inhabit the new city and I said where where where where where have you been reading where have you I I even stuttered where have you been reading he said well brother Branham says that the New Jerusalem will be here I said but not that not the city not the city the New Jerusalem you can put it like this it is a city but it is the bride and the reason I read this is for this next and when you confuse one with the other you'll stand all scripture and everything into chaos into confusion a lot of people says while we're all going to be in heaven in heaven what part of Heaven what part of Heaven so you want me to keep going or today so then now what is heaven okay so Heaven is a condition right all right so as we're talking about the dimensions of all this right here you're thinking about the map that we just saw right oh man it's gonna be from from Illinois is all the way over here Illinois so you're trying to make this place is right why the three dimensions that we live in that's right so you're trying to imagine it like oh it's gonna be like from from Las Cruces to to California you're making like a so you're you know what you in your mind you're thinking all the Rocky Mountains so you you can't make this spiritual New Jerusalem because brother Branham says I have not seen an ear hath not heard it's a place where the Divine Architects Jesus Jesus he's gone to go prepare a Dwelling Place foreign I'm on my mind it's a condition right now we see here that John himself he said I saw the New Jerusalem come down right but in order for John to even see that he had to be in a certain condition yes so you have to be prepared that's why Jesus said I go to prepare a place for you so we got to be prepared all right so I'll let you go ahead brother we're gonna and then we'll go back to man that was good so so brother Branham brother Branham to read this quote as we kind of as we kind of go go into this brother says and the anointing will be upon the New Jerusalem that descends from God out of Heaven prepared as a bride adorned for her husband esposo but watch the way he puts this last part the anointing will be upon them okay so like brother Danny says there you see two okay you remember there's you see the the natural side of the New Jerusalem but as we go we're gonna we're gonna bring that spiritual side so you you see where that that applies because in order to understand how it is that that we get a new city here and so forth but we have to understand how it is that God God changes and God cleanses things right if you if you don't understand the process you'll never understand the end resultado so so God has a method right and when we heard that earlier justification sanctification baptism of the Holy Spirit but but notice that that in order for the New Jerusalem to to to to be here in both the natural and the spirit there's a cleansing that has to take place right but but but I think there's a there's a lot of misconception around this cleansing because we we think of of when the earth is cleansed both naturally and spiritually that that it's just done away with okay right we think that it's annihilated right brother we think many times that we're it's just wiped out and we're gonna just start fresh this is a yeah aniki level but but watch what brother Branham says here he says heavens and earth will pass away now this word means and he's referring to the word parade passing from one Forma to another okay it does not mean Annihilation as the English word would mean pass away it's annihilated yes but the Hebrew word or the Greek word here does not mean pass away no significa it means dignifica from passing from one thing here you go brother Danny look Mira but to pass from one condition to another so so it's not done away with in the sense that that we're done away with and this Earth is done away with it but that it's changed but that weird change from one form the one condition watch the way brother Brandon puts it here in this quote he says Paul is using the same word regeneration of man significance the man has passed from a sinner to a Saints not completely annihilated thank God because where would I be when a man is changed he isn't annihilated but he's a changed persona persona he has been changed from what he was to what he is he says not Annihilator he said that's right so brother Danny now now we find that the believer's gone through justification the believer's gone through through sanctification and those are monody we've gone through the baptism of the Holy Ghost and and as we as we go through the stature of the perfect man perfect and many times as a Believer I think sometimes maybe we we don't understand muchas maybe what are what are end game what our end goal is like we've got all these steps and and we understand the steps but but what is what is the end goal of that right and so and so brother brother Danny if you would continue on the on that line that that you were on there can you take this into what's our end game goal what are we shooting yeah so we're going to the New Jerusalem right see and so brother Branham says in Fellowship by Redemption it says mortal beings as the only ones who lives in Mortal habitations Immortal beings live in Immortal habitation so many like where you live immortal Visions then the place that we go into is until we return back is not a place of brick and mortar no is or precious stones or Jewels it's a place of condition now how many are in conditions tonight am I to see him all right well John said Juan Diego uh we we said a word about John right that he had to be prepared I said I was in the spirit on the Lord's day yes sir condition right now how many are in condition to go see him are we can we raise our hands we're in condition to go see him right now so either we're asleep we're talking naturally and spiritually here right so so we got to wake up right so the question was asked in 2018. rapturing conditions how many are ready for the route to to meet this condition very few hands went up that was 2018 or 2023. we got just about the same result it's a place of conditions Now we move out of this Dimension that we live in salimos esta Dimensions into another dimension and it's a house yes a dwelling place it's a place of conditions so I'm going to leave the next related so so brother Branham brother Branham calls that brother Brandon this and this quote here he says Calvary raises that tied for the Old Testament yes to them who Justified looked for it and in this new dispensation at the coming of the Lord and watch how brother Branham says this remember when when the believer when the believer goes through these these stages at the process it's not Annihilation noise the brother Brown says at the coming of the Lord at the new Earth nutiera so who's Earth anybody anybody here is right what about new Earth right the Rope of Salvation the blood La Sangre the redeeming power that I'm talking about and through the same Systema has redeemed both man and Earth will raise right up into eternity again so he's redeemed both man brother Danny Romano Danny Al hombre andier La Tierra a man brother Jerry I wonder if this would be if this would just be a good place maybe to go and and kind of just briefly touch on the timeline of events and and and run through that a little bit we'll just skim through them because obviously there's so much here so what do we see what are we waiting foreign there's a and then we're waiting for the Rapture we're in the Rapture the actual catching away so then we know he comes through the tribulation period the three and a half years that the Jews received this message the Armageddon it ends the tribulation we know that after that so there's many people that get stuck there they think that that's our destination and keep in mind the bride she's already Eternal at this point because we know the Millennium to be What's called the seventh day or the day of rest but in all reality there's still time Tiempo there's still building of homes there'll still be a war today all these things will still happening so they asked the question will the literal body of the Lord Jesus Christ be there in the Millennium is because the Earth the physical Earth has not passed through Paradise the Earth has not been cleansed yet so the precious feet of our Lord Jesus Christ losses so so it's a day of rest but he's resting now in all reality the bride is already Eternal she's on her Eighth Day they call it what what what's that what's that word [Laughter] and brother Danny it's the holy convocation right that's right but brother random getting points so good that he says it's a holy conversation that's right right so this is what we're having today is a holy Compass that's right that's right he sure does he says that he gets he brother brought him in that message have you ever heard that message he gets so excited when he talks about the Holy convocation he calls it about 12 different things the holy conflagration so so we end up brother Jerry at the Eighth Day yeah so so back here really quick go ahead Melina so people get stuck there it's the eighth day but then it goes back to the first day brother says so we got to complete a day with God which is a thousand years so then we know that Satan is loose for a little season after that and he starts to deceive those Nations that are left over because we know in Armageddon there's still Nations that are left over so those Nations that are left over have to pay tribute or tithe to the bride so when saying when he's let loose for a little season he begins to deceive those Nations honest and they began to murmur and bicker Plato they began to say well there there are a few it is and why should we have to pay tithesis they began to say well why do we have to do these things so they come against the bride now but at that time God himself comes down the Battle of God is away with it she doesn't have to lift the fingers and brother Jerry to that point there of of when Satan is loosed his brother Branham says he's in a chain of circumstances so when he's lose uh telling all these all these nations okay look at Israel Israel at the time Israel it looks very vulnerable you know it doesn't have any walls it's just it's just uh it's just a place where it looks like like so when he's when he's deceiving them look how it's look how easily it's going to be look how they are it almost looks as they are complacent because there hasn't been any any War there haven't been any there there hasn't been any deception thousand years of peace there's no need for for all this so when he's loose well and he has this this deception he brings all these armies like you said brother uh Jerry again that God himself he reigns fire and brimstone all right and and in the Book of Revelation it says that the casualties or the death or or la muerte is so is so incredible there's so much blood that it takes them six months to get all these bodies out of the way so much destruction but the bride but a la Novia where's she at honeymoon glory to God all right go ahead reject so so he fights and tells us and then the gray went through judgment let me ask you a question or we know that the Saints is tonight anybody say it the way he said it on the tape anyone brave enough anyone brave enough so I we I think we listen to this we to be honest with you I couldn't find the answer I had to listen to that message about 50 times but the way the brother the way the brother Tommy answers it is the way the brother brand amounts and that time frame is dependent upon depende the sentence of the worst person that is sentenced that the great white Throne whether it be Adolf Hitler yes yeah Hitler whether it be whoever it be Genghis Khan Genghis Khan whoever it would be because remember brother Danny that that brother Branham says that that each person receives a judgment in a degree right there's no reason that that somebody who has not done what Adolf Hitler did so Hitler would suffer as long as he does so what is the time frame between the Millennium in the New Jerusalem however long it takes for that sentence for that person to be fulfilled Persona during that time Tiempo that's a good question that's a good question okay what do you got so I I don't know to be determined suspenders so the burning of that sentence as I'm saying is that during that time that everything ignites yes pastor says yes because remember the Earth has to go through its chains the only way Jesus will come back on this Earth has to be changed it has to be a new Earth just like with the believer exactly exactly the only way Jesus can live in your heart it's got to be a change is hold on hold on you're unloading the atomic bombs already yeah hold on okay all right okay all right brother Jerry our brother Danny here we go so to bring this back around and and to finish this up okay we're going to go into Revelations 3 12. uh apocalypse okay we're gonna we're gonna set it up for brother Danny and brother Jerry here to finish it out okay uh uh that's where you're the moderator thank you and this is this is this is where the believer becomes a part becomes that New Jerusalem Revelation 3 12 tells us him that overcometh is in the temple of my God and he shall go no more out and I will ride upon him the name of my God and the name of the city of my God which is New Jerusalem which cometh down out of Heaven from God and I will write upon him my new name brother Danny no Lenny okay so the name Jerusalem the name the meaning of the name is quite astonishing significance okay so the core word in this name is s-h-a-l-e-m Ama I'm gonna put these back on which means a significa completeness I might and wholeness so the word shalom shalom how many remembers the message that was preached how was your peace it's a place of peace right the Melchizedek was there wasn't he the king of Salem how many remembers that message okay so it's a um which means uh Peace So peace significa pass Shalom comes from this word as well and so any peace depends on both completeness um so keep in mind that the New Jerusalem must be a place of completeness because it is a Dwelling Place of the Lord God as he himself attested as we read in Zechariah 3.3 Ocho Tres that he will dwell in the midst of Jerusalem and shall be called the city of Truth so the first part of the name Jerusalem is oh which can mean either they will see yes or they will fill the office that's Jerusalem that's but we're talking about the New Jerusalem so they're gonna see or they will fill the ah when you put the first part together you fully understand the name Jerusalem they will see the wholeness or they will fill the uh or they will fill the all of the completeness and so from this point we need no interpretation regarding interpretation the identity of the wholeness or of the completeness of the New Jerusalem stairs there he is there is the bride oh my God the bride La Novia let's see what he said here now we make sure that we don't miss it he come he got out over come there's this way of Adventure will shall be a pillar in the temple of my God and shall not go out anymore the bride's standing there with the bridegroom if we could have the time to take that that out for the book over there over in Revelation all the kings of the earth bring their honor into it that's like the type the tribe of Levi is as we heard all the rest of them pays ties to him and he goes on but he says what is it guess it's the bride yes the bride is that City LA Novia is the bride is that church Tiempo uh for eternity right yes go ahead brother Jerry hey Matt wow wow so watch let me interject this okay a very important crucial component um a message that are preached by our pastor brother Caleb um and here on this Isaiah 65 17 yeah he says for behold I create new heavens and a new Earth and the former shall not be remembered nor come into mind amen how many remember our pastor preaching that I'm not holding on to things no no uh not letting those old things drag us down not letting those old grudges Hold Us Down how many remembers I do because I have to practice that every day you haven't seen the universe so we have to keep those things in mind that's crucial because remember it comes down in the shape of a pyramid it says so so I see the pyramid coming down climbing a pyramid so when those both unite so this is the New Jerusalem we're talking about we know that every born-again believer is a Jew so what symbol does it shows one of them is upside down they said let me show you this little Point here hopefully I can find it here okay here we go so we must apply the word remember that okay Jerusalem comes down in the shape of a pyramid but the bride has to go up the pyramid it's not that one I found it watch in the future home and so John saw the holy city the New Jerusalem descending like a comet um Paloma well you see how the comments they come down here first then come on so we see the New Jerusalem coming down and that's going up you know it's the sign that Unity is of almighty God in his people together not for a thousand years all tears are wiped away oh problems everything that we've had to go through it pales in comparison to this that's right that's right amen I have not seen nor your third riper down my eternity is what it is located that's what we're after the Millennium the Millennium is still time is temporary we're on our way to Eternity that's right anything else let us stand tonight yeah Round of Applause for the panel here brother Gary Brothers thank you all God richly bless you it was a blessing teaching everyone
