uh the commonality between all these was before i went up i remember i talked to my family or i'd be in church or i'd say a prayer the night before i just say hey um say a prayer for me i have my exam tomorrow and sure enough uh as it went on i passed every single one with with flying colors and uh for this last one i really i don't know if the colors are really flying but they were at least colors

rough i don't know if i'm going to make it and share it up by the grace of god i did barely i mean literally on the number um so i'm very thankful for that and i just wanted to give this testimony to let you all know that god's doing things and um he's helping me out and i hope that he's helping you out all as well and uh if you need something done just say a little prayer and he'll help you out

we will get out of the way and let god speak amen is that why you all came to hear tonight you sure didn't come to hear me right amen but i know you love me you're sick but you still would rather hear god speak than me preference now if we were out somewhere could go to a restaurant if we were out somewhere to go to a restaurant i would want to hear you talk and you could hear me talk to we have fellowship and eat food and you [Music] let's start with our first scripture and very common scripture the same one our prophet used in the message power to transform the transformation and it's the 12th chapter of the book of romans romano amen the verse three verses i beseech you therefore brethren by the mercies of god hermanos was regular that ye present your bodies a living sacrifice sacrificial vivo who's going to present their bodies a living sacrifice a living sacrifice holy and acceptable unto god which is your reasonable service and be not conformed to this world but be transformed by the renewing of your mind that ye may prove what is that good acceptable and perfect will of god transformed or i say through the grace given unto me to every man that is among you to not think of himself more highly than he ought to think but to think soberly according as god had dealt to every man the measure of faith amen now we're going to go to the book of romans and uh brother gaba up there i changed me and very changed the verses it's going to be verses 22 and 23. romano of roman romanov thank you for we know that the whole creation growneth let us pray dear lord witness thank you for this evening we love you with all of our hearts and we thank you for all your mercy and all your goodness we will be sure to give you all the honor and the glory gloria in the precious name of our lord and savior jesus christ amen you may be seated i want to continue on that verse there or we for we know who knows the knowledge of god begins to kick in for we know that the whole about people or the earth or the animals oh it's definitely is depending on you and me so simple but yeah that's that's god's word the whole creation grown up and travaileth and pain i want him to get that in spanish there's no way that we are going to be able to groan and travail no no no um every one on their own swing or as they would say crudely every monkey on his own right it's something that's happening together and not only they but ourselves also now it's talking about us which have the first fruits of the spirit you know even we ourselves grown within ourselves waiting for the adoption esperanto adoption to quit the redemption of the body so notice until you get the first fruits of the spirit of spiritual and what is the first speech of the spirit it's the same thing as the earnest it is the down payment estimation it's your portion that god gives you cure while you're on earth not somebody else's portion but your portion his presence the supreme of his spirit in you and that comes how many can tell me how does that come it comes through the new birthday where you have the first fruits of the spirit you will never groan for the adoption the redemption of the body now we're going to be speaking about some words here um but before i give you the definition of the word transform and don't worry about this one up there guys i didn't give it to you my fault is the word what's the opposite of transform can somebody tell me a transformer that transformer so in our lives las vegas is it transformation is transformation or brother jonathan is it deformation or hermano jonathan is the formation and you say well we don't we don't have nothing to do with the deformation that's a good one i like that but i like the crude one too that's very better spanish than mine tomorrow the character of but uh a marriage deformed by jealousy if i don't have confidence in you by now or you don't have confidence me by now you know well i guess you better sit down and let bill jonathan preach i guess you know i have all the confidence he could ever have in a lady what a lady god gave me yeah i'm not going to say poor lady i'm going to say wonderful lady wow we're going to get into that one a little bit what's causing this stress in a believer oh i thought believers didn't have stress not indian how many of you ever had stress want to something to stress so what's causing that stress yes amen now i want to go to our first quote out of the greatest battle ever fought and there's something about our makeup the way god made us that could not be deformed you know no puerto rico and i'm speaking on both sides here can you get you to understand i am trying to understand well they don't have it up here yet but i'll i'll go ahead and read it here off there we go let's get down here this i'm going to read it it's paragraph 114. and that's not the right one greatest battle ever thought paragraph 104 what was the matter there we go what was the matter you had to open the channel first what channel is it talking about the channel between your soul your spirit and your mind spiritually or your head we don't want to get going on that but that'll be a channel that when something comes into your mind how many have read this message the greatest battle ever man i'm not going to go into the channel but now he tells you exactly what you got to do he tells me what i need to do got to get the soldier the holy spirit el espiritu placed at the battlefront and i could keep reading but i don't want to well you know this part down here let's go back let's go down to this part down here that's what's the matter with so many blowed up christians it is amen it's because they don't clean the channels out especially they don't go down in the inside no and coming but did you know what the deformation did to you and me from the fall de la caida without a transformation first to no transformation there's no way for it to come from the inside his spirit didn't cover over his soul his soul was in the forefront of the french right but under the fall of [Music] the attack now if you go to this same message and i'm referring also to the message sunday king of salem king of righteousness and the spirit of his soul or the spirit of his nature spiritually was he himself he that existed out and by himself then from spirit king of righteousness to king [Music] by the king and through this body he can be a king through you spirit but it wasn't the spirit inside the soul the spirit was then through the alma that spirit had to leave now he had his soul he had a spirit as a human now i want to go to the scripture in psalms our first scripture in psalms it's psalms 18's brothers up there there it is and i want to speak a little bit about david remember where the the transformation of our faith the transformation remember whether you've got to get the holy spirit the soldier el soldado in france in the part of the french battle front you can do it we're going to get into it a little bit what was the difference of how the holy spirit could lead somebody in the old testament and how they could help the spirit become the spirit but not in the same way you and i can help under the new testament and why is that because the full redemption had not yet been paid but a lot or most of what they had to do was literally romans 12. they had to do it but they had to have a desire in their heart the holy spirit could influence them the holy spirit could anoint them but yet they could not totally overcome [Applause] are you understanding me so far you know as i i was studying this in in my inventory of my life i could just see the faces of our young people in my mind you know the things that i would like to preach there's a lot of things i would like to preach supposed to get you i don't want to get sidetracked amen psalms 18 21 for i have kept the thy ways of the thy way the ways of the lord and i did not put away his statutes from me david is telling you this is the only way he could deal with it but it's something that dave did have to constantly do is desire does this sound like some of us really this is the way it works with you and me till we receive the first fruits of the spirit amen and this is what's going to transform our faith from a natural earth-bound faith to a heavenly faith this is what's going to put us in a place where god can perfect our faith we can go into perfect faith 23 i was also upright before him and i kept myself from my inequity here's a point i want to make here he had to keep himself from oh i can't do that brother i i i i need the holy ghost until you present your body a living sacrifice it kind of sounds like a contradiction if you really break it down we know it's not so much but he's saying so he knows that he a lot of things that he shouldn't do or that he should do and he doesn't do them and how did he keep himself from that inaudible he didn't hang around with the same crowd he avoided it because we know if we subject ourselves even to a little bit of our past iniquities we're just not so sure that we're not going to fall no no but david knew that he would fall but he had such a strong desire in his heart that he kept himself from yeah because we're still under this until we get the first fruits of the spirit let's go to our next scripture brothers in psalms see got it here the next one would be psalms 119. there we go and this is where i i got this picture of our young people now middle-aged younger folks are counted here come on you're not as old as me how many how many of us older younger folks er okay i'll be clear over 65. shall a young man cleanse his way verse 9 119 9. how many of you young men have asked yourself that question by taking heed there unto according to thy word the last part with my whole heart have i said can you imagine he couldn't have the holy spirit enthroned in his soul as far as he knew how many of us don't let me be a vagabond yeah wondering wandering stars amen the next verse verse 11 please answer for thy word have i hid in my heart that i might not sin against thee i know i'm not perfect disbelieve the plan you have for my life blessed art thou o lord teach me thy statute oh that he was then humbling himself before god how many have a teachable spirit you always have to teach those people sometimes you just notice this is david in the old testament that could not divorce them he believed in those substitutes that god would hear him because he was obeying the word that had been revealed to him next scripture in psalms 51. many of us have read this one many times create in me a clean heart oh god watch this yeah it's really the next verse cast me not away from thy presence he was desiring that august presence yeah it's hard i had a hard time with it too amen take me not away from thy presence and take not thy holy spirit from me holy spirit it couldn't be it was great the holy not that the holy spirit wasn't great okay speak to something but he didn't want the holy spirit to leave him and that's that he couldn't really receive it in the throne of his soul but he knew that in his condition if he the transformation of your faith from under allah the transformation of a sacrifice that couldn't perfect you know to a sacrifice now i'll sacrifice and bring the soldier of the holy spirit no longer under a bunch of junk not under a bunch of worldly spirits why the holy spirit controls that next spirit foreign [Applause] of the body blessed be the name of the lord amen we love the lord jesus we just thank him so much notice so now let's get down how many want that power of transformation the transformation we've heard these things for years but god is trying to make them real in our lives where does that power of transformation lay and establish the transformation i'm going to let you think on that one praise god next question what does the enemy use against us nosotros instead of transforming and lugar de transformers these are questions that he was asking me this is inventory for me for me so i'm not even pointing it just notice i'm putting the finger sideways pointing the fingertip i'm kind of just going like this next question or next this is a statement so as we go through the process of the new birth how many have been born again how many know about a shadow of a doubt you've been born again praise god i'm not going to say anything no way i'm not trying to make anybody feel bad right do you really know the real you the element of el real usted so as we go through this process of the new birth our spirit and our soul are being redeemed yes the redemption was paid yes but now we're not waiting to baby james john one that laid on jesus's bosom yeah that's good and then in the book of revelation let me ask was he born anybody want to answer that one that's really actually a pretty easy one i think it might get a lot was john one there on the day of pentecost was john there on the day of pentecost amen man did john receive the first fruits of the spirit of spiritual yes see did john have a new birth yes three does he represent the bride represent yes see he was there was no [Applause] i wish there was a way to really translate that into spanish it's more of an expression than anything i want the redemption of this body glory to the living god amen now so conscious you've gone over the spirit a little bit with the first fruits we can fulfill the scripture and sounds almost there's no way there's not even a crack or a crevice no i ain't dedura nothing not even a little open space satan can get into my soul and until we get to that point i don't care you can give me boils from my head to my toes but you can't touch my soul oh he'll curse you to your face said to god that's my boy it's just me mijo there's nobody like him on earth if that was under the law yes yes if we walk with allah there was grace we understand sacrifice right now but we let the devil lie to us because our faith needs to be transformed you know my time [Music] praise the lord i'm i'm happy but if i don't get to any of those quotes i gave them i don't know like four or five up there but that's okay what the healing okay so we went through the spirit this wall uh spiritual then what part of us remains that hasn't been redeemed or changed yet we just said it right what's the part that hasn't been redeemed come on yeah yes looking at it from one another yes absolutely absolutely it is he wants you to get this captain so our enemy uses this deformed body against us that's and the holy spirit why do we let them use this thing against them this okay okay okay let's go to our quotes now in the message god's power to [Music] and actually brothers uh i'm at the paragraph 64 b and i know it's hard because it's not quite written that way but but i'll just start where i've got it here control so with everything in the trust of his own son that it would be that way then god said it's all good so i'll just rest and each one of those seeds has power in itself to transform itself into the species that i desire you make exactly what i wanted to be okay where is this power of transformation transformation where does it live in that field of transformation the transformation inside of that scene itself and then it already has power to be transformed to lay down doesn't make you feel good oh i'm not a meaning myself this is this is a word paragraph 66. now after it was all well and set in order god felt sure now that this would be all all be all god gave power to transform he had power to deform or there that the former the former not transformed no transformers now anything that is deformed is taken from the original state yes there's something that's wrong with it why how many are back to your original state pantos is but when that time comes when you when you see what we have seen on a minor scale you will see it come into the fullness of its power when that confederation of churches iglesias brings the boycott is and i don't want to say too much because we're on youtube i'm not scared to say it either no no what is the boycott yes the modern word for it's actually two words yes cancer cancel cancellar culture they just cancel you out the muscle concern well we know the squeeze has been here as our pastor said where in the world have you been when it squeezes to the point where you can't breathe you think twice about interpreting me again all right no they're not the same but they're connected no no no i want you to give you my analysis of what satan's done in eden analysis he sprayed a horrible poison spray would you like to know what that spray was how many would you like to know what that spray was i can tell i got the formula of it formula filled its place okay that went into the seed satan filled that cavity with knowledge and science transform to change character or condition a character or instance of transformation you got more have you got more of the definition there brother not already okay i'll keep reading okay then it takes you to the word transpose to change in form for a cambiar informa appearance or you or and what is your structure your composition composition it's how you're put together escomo sustain and depending on how you put together it depends there's certain things that make you tick i those things don't make you acts first first right away when you're confronted with something there's something that steps forwards first still in the background and the soldier of the holy spirit cannot take his place in the battlefront what's the center of your attention what makes you tick i can use other words but you know they get kind of functional invert applies cheaply to turning something upside down or inside out or we were born backwards the makeup of our spiritual being spiritual was backwards it needs to be inverted that's why when your faith is as you would say on needles and pins you call a brother up and they're coughing nobody offers to pray for them well what in the world did you call him but of your faith if they don't want you to pray for them don't get me wrong you can't force yourself on nobody i have that living faith that sickness has to go back to amen it's got to be flipped our nature's got to be flipped back the way it was before we failed now let's go to the message power of transformation how many of you read these messages oh they are incredible i'm sure a lot of you have this one here got me [Music] he's talking about when he started the tape room in the tapes this is paragraph 16b again here i am well yeah he got it here but what a greater thing god has did for them most anybody can make a tape to use online i am not lessening the fact that we live on the tapes of brother branham and we believe it and we'll listen to them until we're raptured out of here or go six feet under anybody can make a tape that's got the intelligence to turn on the tape recorder [Music] still never 19. but to hear these comments of these young soldiers here you're not young blood jimmy wow that's the word of god yes and myself getting old are you opening and what you placed into believe the message that i have been given of god now if it wasn't for you all right the message would do no good it's got to be somebody to believe it as his great economy like that that when he sends forth something there is something there to meet that something that's all okay let's go to paragraph 77 this is what the lord opened to me this sunday morning over 30 years ago more than 30 years ago i can't remember the exact years sacramento and my wife gets up because i had this dream and we were by this highway establishment and they were in these beautiful mountains on the other side of the highway there was brothers from phoenix go in there then i'm when she gets up with that dream he come in to tell me i'm sitting on the couch reading this quote because i had come to this time i'm not saying this is going to happen to you literally the way it happened to me sometimes you have to separate from everything that's there on earth to take your position that god has called you tomorrow i'm sure you can read between the lines what i'm saying is sometimes the very dearest person on earth you have to shake hands with them and take your position and cry position increasing where god has called you see what is god doing transforming you from what you was transferring maybe a daughter or a son or whatever it is from a lovely family sometimes not familiar we want a lot of services he places you somewhere else because it's his way of doing it is [Music] dear lord jesus forgive me [Music] sometimes i i lose sight of this lord [Music] may not be popular lord he said but it was your way of doing it [Music] we knew in my mind [Music] you're showing your purpose in their [Music] lives [Music] there's such a point what we love each other with your love lord [Music] [Music] be at the door waiting for the doors to open [Music] go in and have fellowship with god in with our brethren

in my heart but my dreams turned to ashes and my castles are crumpled and my fortune turned to lost so i wrapped it all up in the racks of my life and i laid at the grass good all of my confusion
