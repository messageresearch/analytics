[10:16] My name is Marisa García I would like to
[10:19] express my gratitude to Lord Jesus
[10:22] Christ for blessing me with this amazing
[10:25] opportunity. have been able to go to
[10:27] Uganda to meet our brothers and
[10:29] sisters. I still cannot believe I went.
[10:33] It was wonderful to meet Brother
[10:34] Julius's family and all the other
[10:37] brothers and sisters that we had the
[10:38] pleasure of
[10:40] meeting. I want to say that the
[10:42] dedication services were amazing. I feel
[10:45] so blessed and honored to have been a
[10:47] part of
[10:48] that. It was a remarkable experience all
[10:52] together.
[10:53] I had such a wonderful time that I would
[10:55] go again in a heartbeat and I wish that
[10:59] everyone of you could go as well. I want
[11:03] to thank you all for your prayers and
[11:05] may the Lord rich bless
[11:10] you. God bless you. I greet you in the
[11:13] name of the Lord Jesus Christ. First of
[11:15] all, I would like to thank pastor Caleb
[11:17] for the opportunity to speak a few words
[11:19] of our trip that we took to Uganda. So
[11:21] grateful unto the Lord that he allowed
[11:23] my wife to accompany me on this trip. Uh
[11:26] truly it was a blessing. I would like to
[11:29] read the scripture in
[11:30] Psalms
[11:32] 1221. I was glad when they said unto me,
[11:35] let us go into the house of the Lord.
[11:38] Uh
[11:40] truly without words so thankful unto the
[11:44] Lord that he allowed me to go once
[11:47] again. I was reading in a quote that I
[11:50] would like to read. It's uh God has
[11:52] provided away. I preached in 1956
[11:55] January the 8th. We're living in the day
[11:58] of the coming of the Lord and the night
[12:00] is fastly falling. Ministers are
[12:02] sweating it out, praying out. God
[12:05] showing signs and wonders and there's a
[12:07] storm coming. He is coming. There's a
[12:11] storm on and a great revival time. A
[12:14] time that this world has never seen. A
[12:16] time like it's going through right now.
[12:19] There has never been a time in the
[12:21] history of the world at any age or at or
[12:24] any time where the gospel of the power
[12:27] of God has ever been demonstrated like
[12:30] it is right now. Through faithful
[12:33] ministers into the mission fields to the
[12:36] Africans into different places. Great
[12:39] healing revivals and powers and works
[12:42] and signs and wonders are coming
[12:45] everywhere. Never was in all the world.
[12:49] Never was in all the world like it.
[12:51] Friends, God has provided it. God has
[12:54] spoke it. And God is performing
[12:58] it. And for me personally to see the
[13:01] Lord moving in such a supernatural way.
[13:05] Uh while we were there, uh while Brother
[13:07] Jimmy was speaking last week, God placed
[13:11] upon my heart a thought of taking God at
[13:14] his word.
[13:15] And that's exactly what happened at the
[13:19] beginning of the trip.
[13:21] uh by taking God his word, he moved in
[13:24] such a supernatural way. And if the Lord
[13:27] permits one day, I would like to share
[13:29] that with you.
[13:32] because there's enough time to say it
[13:34] right now. But but to see the Lord
[13:37] moving in such a supernatural way, if we
[13:40] would take God ahead his word and to see
[13:42] what he and how he is moving amongst his
[13:46] people and to see the people there in
[13:48] Africa in Uganda
[13:51] just taking all of it in and believing
[13:55] on every word that is spoken there.
[13:59] It's there's no words to describe it.
[14:03] There's And I know you've heard from the
[14:05] different testimonies of the different
[14:07] brothers and the things that that they
[14:10] spoke
[14:11] about but to me
[14:14] this this is a trip that I will never
[14:17] forget.
[14:18] As soon as I got back home, I was
[14:21] wanting to go back again. And it is
[14:23] there's a pool there for me in Uganda
[14:26] and I can feel it that I want to go back
[14:29] already, but the Lord knows all things
[14:32] and in his perfect time if the Lord
[14:35] allows I'm looking forward to returning
[14:38] once
[14:39] again. But I'm so thankful for all of
[14:43] you for your prayers and your support
[14:46] and the prayers of the group brother Tim
[14:48] and the rest of the group here in
[14:50] Phoenix for their prayers
[14:51] for without their prayers. I don't know
[14:54] if this would have been possible.
[14:57] Um but I I am so thankful for everything
[15:00] that he has done and to see the Lord
[15:03] moving there in that country. The
[15:05] revival that is sweeping through that
[15:08] country of Uganda.
[15:11] What a blessing. What
[15:13] a what a blessing it is. And the people
[15:17] there, the love that they show to each
[15:18] and every one of us, uh words cannot
[15:21] describe it. Uh the love that they show,
[15:24] the love that we
[15:27] feel, they say that they're blessed when
[15:31] we arrive there. But I am blessed. We
[15:35] are blessed when we see we are blessed
[15:38] to be able to go there and the love that
[15:40] they show us and and it is like no
[15:43] weather. So I'm so grateful that I was
[15:46] able to go and I thank you. I thank
[15:49] brother Tim and each and every one of
[15:51] you for your prayers.
[15:55] I love you with all my heart and I thank
[15:58] you and until we meet again, God bless
[16:03] [Aplausos]
[16:38] Dios les bendiga a todos.
[16:44] Es un gran oportunidad de poder
[16:45] saludarlos en el nombre del Señor
[16:46] Jesucristo.
[16:50] Es muy sorprendiente mirar la novia de
[16:52] Cristo.
[16:55] Me subo acá arriba. Estoy muy
[16:57] agradecido por mi pastor,
[17:02] hermano, hermano Bernabé,
[17:05] hermano Tomás,
[17:10] creendo en mí lo que lo que yo creo en
[17:12] mí mismo.
[17:15] A través de la
[17:17] vida era una
[17:20] peleador, no en la manera correcta.
[17:29] La primera vez que me mandaron para
[17:32] hospital porque me peleé,
[17:35] todavía estaba en pañales.
[17:38] Aquí estoy.
[17:43] Un testimonio,
[17:45] un
[17:49] poema, algo que aprendí que me hermano
[17:52] Caleb me enseñó.
[17:56] No sea termómetros, sea termómetros,
[18:03] termostatos. Tenemos que responder, no
[18:05] como
[18:07] reaccionar. Los
[18:11] bomberos, policías, ambulancias son las
[18:14] primeras que actúan.
[18:18] No son trenados para hacer para
[18:20] reaccionar, son para
[18:23] responder. Pido una
[18:26] cosa, me gusta mirar las
[18:29] cosas como yo digo, como un testimonio
[18:34] testimonio, un poema y no más pueden
[18:36] cerrar sus ojos y más escuchen.
[18:44] Mi título de este poema es mi
[18:45] conversación con mi Señor
[18:49] Dios. Tomás escuchen.
[18:53] God,
[18:57] God,
[19:02] God. My Lord God.
[19:14] son. Why do I feel like a bunch of
[19:18] broken
[19:24] pieces? Why do I feel like I'm in a
[19:32] box, son?
[19:38] The
[19:38] moment you were punched and kicked in
[19:41] the
[19:44] wom in your
[19:46] life, I protected
[19:53] you. When you were born half
[19:58] dead, I protected
[20:04] you. When your home was
[20:08] surrounded by drug dealers and gang
[20:11] bangers that wanted blood, when you're
[20:15] young, nobody taught you how to pray and
[20:18] you called
[20:21] out cuz there was something
[20:25] there. when he sat on that curb crying
[20:30] alone at night not knowing if your mom
[20:33] or dad were going to die. I was
[20:38] there son. When you turn to drugs and
[20:41] addicted because you taught that's what
[20:45] could heal you and make you feel better.
[20:48] I was
[20:51] there son when you were young and you
[20:54] tied to yourself to that tree and jumped
[20:57] I broke the
[20:59] branch and
[21:05] prot
[21:08] son when you hurt
[21:13] others and hurt
[21:17] yourself. I was there to not let you go
[21:19] too
[21:22] far.
[21:25] Son, I am your healer. I am your
[21:28] redeemer. I am your
[21:30] shepherd. I am your provider. And you
[21:34] are
[21:35] mine son.
[21:38] As a
[21:39] diamond is shaped in heat and pressure
[21:42] and pushed out from the earth's
[21:45] mantle into the hands of a
[21:48] master who looks at it and picks it up
[21:51] and sees what needs to be chipped away,
[21:55] what needs to be taken away.
[21:57] And he looks at it again and more needs
[21:59] to be taken off of it. And his precious
[22:03] hands, he forms it, shapes it, and
[22:05] polishes it. Sun, he polishes it so that
[22:09] light could shine through from the light
[22:11] from the sun could shine through to
[22:14] reflect the beautiful colors of the
[22:15] rainbow sun. And do you know what that
[22:18] process is called, son? It's called
[22:22] fire. Did you hear me? It's
[22:25] fire. Son, hear me? It's Holy Ghost
[22:28] fire sun and as a lighthouse that is
[22:32] built on the rock.
[22:34] The light that shines through my light,
[22:37] through my
[22:38] diamonds, it's not meant for the
[22:41] lighthouse, but it's meant for those
[22:43] that are in the storm to see and to seek
[22:47] hope and know that there is a way to
[22:50] look at my sons and daughters and to see
[22:53] that they've overcome and that they
[22:54] could do it, too. Son, you are mine.
[22:58] You've always been mine. My sons and
[23:01] daughters, they're all
[23:03] mine. Reflect that light. Give hope
[23:07] through this
[23:09] process to all my brothers and sisters.
[23:18] Quiero terminar con la escritura.
[23:24] Deuteronomio
[23:27] 316. Sea fuerte.
[23:29] Buen
[23:30] ánimo. No te
[23:33] amas porque se
[23:36] Jesucristo, él
[23:38] va no te va a fallar ni te
[23:42] [Aplausos]
[23:53] desamparará. Póngase de pie, por favor.
[23:58] Gracias a Dios por los
[23:59] testimonios, los
[24:02] poemas. Que Dios los bendiga.
[24:06] Vamos a hacer una
[24:07] [Música]
[24:09] oración. Padre
[24:12] celestial, un gran privilegio y un
[24:16] honor estar aquí en tu casa una vez
[24:19] más. Lo rendimos a

[24:23] ti. Vamos a recibir palabras de vida
[24:25] eterna.

[24:29] [Música]
[24:31] lado. Puede llenar cada uno de
[24:34] [Música]
[24:36] nosotros. Colocamos este servicio en tus
[24:38] manos.
[24:40] En el nombre del Señor Jesucristo
[24:41] oramos. Amén.
[24:45] [Música]
[24:57] al esperamos la
[25:01] victoria al que el
[25:03] Señor él mismo nos
[25:07] dará. Después
[25:09] iremos estar con él en él gloria.

[25:31] Señor. E aleluya,

[25:44] Muchas moradas Jesús ha
[25:49] prometido de las que dijo nos iba a
[25:55] preparar.
[25:57] Dejando estas por siempre en el
[26:01] olvido.
[26:03] Adeas nos vamos a acordar.
[26:08] Oh, aleluya.

[27:21] Y cuando pastes por las aguas, contigo
[27:27] estaré. Y por los
[27:30] ríos no te alegarán.
[27:34] Y cuando pases por el fuego y no te
[27:40] quemarás, la
[27:42] llamará en
[27:45] ti. Y grande es Jehová y digno de ser
[27:51] alabado la ciudad de nuestro Dios.
[27:56] En su monte santo y hermosa provincia,
[28:01] el gozo de toda la tierra es a los lados
[28:06] del norte, la ciudad del gran
[28:10] rey. Y si soy yo, si soy yo, soy el
[28:15] templo. Y si soy yo, sí soy yo. Soy el
[28:20] templo.
[28:23] Sío, sí soy yo. Soy el
[28:27] templo. Oh, soy el templo del Espíritu
[28:32] de
[28:33] Dios y lleno de poder, lleno de gracia,
[28:37] lleno de
[28:39] gloria y lleno de poder, lleno de
[28:43] gracia, lleno de
[28:45] gloria y lleno de poder, lleno de
[28:49] gracia, lleno de gloria.
[28:52] Os doy el templo del espíritu de
[28:58] [Música]
[29:00] Dios. ¿Cuántos son el templo en esta
[29:05] mañana? Vamos a pedir que hermano
[29:07] Salvador Guerrergo
[29:10] pase, que ore por las peticiones y
[29:14] ofrendas, creyendo que ya está aquí en
[29:16] esta
[29:20] mañana. Amén.
[29:22] Él ya está aquí en esta mañana,
[29:24] ¿verdad? Damos gracias a
[29:27] Dios. Y antes de orar quiero decirle
[29:30] algo que pasó
[29:33] sobrenatural, porque Dios es
[29:35] sobrenatural.
[29:37] Cuando Dios le dio la sanidad a mi
[29:40] madre, eh el el doctor no sabía cómo
[29:45] explicarlo y le dijo, "No solamente
[29:47] usted está
[29:49] sana, sino usted tiene unos riñones
[29:52] nuevos y un hígado
[29:54] nuevo. Yo no sé cómo explicar eso,"
[29:57] dijo, "pero le hicimos cuatro estudios
[30:00] en su
[30:01] hígado y su hígado está nuevo."
[30:04] Que a Dios sea la honra y la gloria
[30:08] por
[30:10] Yos está aquí, está aquí para suplir las
[30:15] necesidades de su
[30:17] pueblo. Dice el profeta, "La fe no
[30:22] razona, la fe solamente lo
[30:25] cree. Así de
[30:27] sencillo. Solo pídalo, créalo y Dios se
[30:31] lo va a dar.

[31:21] Acéptelo porque él ya se lo dio. Oremos
[31:24] en esta mañana. Bendito sea, Señor Dios.
[31:28] Gracias por este día, hermosa mañana que
[31:31] tú nos

[31:52] leídas, que sea recibida su sanidad, la
[31:56] cual tú has dado, que lo acepten. En el
[32:00] nombre del Señor Jesucristo.
[32:03] Prendemos cualquier demonio que quiera
[32:07] interponerse y que traiga testimonio,
[32:10] Señor, dándote solamente a ti la honra y
[32:13] la gloria, Padre. Bendice estas manos
[32:16] que están levantadas.
[32:18] suple sus necesidades, Señor, que ahí
[32:21] donde están ellos solamente
[32:23] miren que todo fue dado en la cruz del
[32:27] calvario y que solamente tenemos que
[32:30] recibirlo,
[32:32] aceptarlo porque tú nos lo has dado,
[32:35] Señor. Gracias, Padre Santo, por este
[32:38] día. Te rogamos, Señor, que tú bendigas,
[32:42] Señor, y que tú suplas estas estas
[32:46] peticiones, Padre.
[32:48] Ahora oramos, Señor, serán recolectados
[32:51] los diezmos y las
[32:53] ofrendas. Solamente es una señal de las
[32:57] bendiciones que tú has dado a tu
[33:00] pueblo. Gracias, Señor, por
[33:02] bendecirnos. No solamente con
[33:05] salud, sino tú nos das en nuestra mesa
[33:09] alimento, nos das un techo donde morar.
[33:13] Gracias, Señor. Te damos a ti, Señor, lo
[33:17] que es tuyo. Gracias por todo. A ti sea
[33:21] la honra y la gloria. A ti sea el poder
[33:24] y la
[33:26] majestad. En el nombre de nuestro Señor
[33:29] Jesucristo. Amén. Y amén.
[33:31] [Música]
[33:35] Se pueden
[33:36] [Música]
[33:38] asentar. Tres especiales en esta mañana.
[33:44] y la
[33:46] hermana y
[33:49] después la última de la hermana Rachel.
[34:46] God bless
[34:48] you. Just a surprised to be up here as
[34:52] to see me.
[34:54] Um, but my son asked me to uh sing this
[34:58] song when he first um asked me if I'd
[35:01] heard it. Um, I hadn't um it was pretty
[35:05] special when I when I did. And
[35:09] um it uh I've always loved the story of
[35:12] the the prodigal son um the loving
[35:15] father.
[35:18] I can get through
[35:20] this. Father, that's there to
[35:23] welcome. Um, no matter where you've
[35:25] been, what you've
[35:28] done, how far you've
[35:30] run, he's not just willing to welcome
[35:32] you back home, but he's there. He's
[35:35] ready to go and get you no matter how
[35:38] far you you've gone and um bring you
[35:43] home. And
[35:46] uh it just also ties in with one of my
[35:49] favorite Corey Tenbom. I'm sure yall are
[35:52] pretty familiar with her but it's a
[35:54] simple reminder that there there's no
[35:57] pit so deep that God's love isn't deeper
[36:00] still.
[36:01] So, forgive me. I'm not a singer. This
[36:05] isn't my lane, but we'll give it a go.
[36:08] God bless
[36:17] [Música]
[36:25] you. I thought the world had something
[36:29] special.
[36:30] I was
[36:33] missing. My daddy told me not to chase
[36:38] it. Didn't
[36:40] [Música]
[36:41] listen. I fell down here a mile, a
[36:45] minute before I knew it. I was living in
[36:51] a
[36:51] ped a long long way from home.
[36:58] [Música]
[36:59] like a
[37:01] reel
[37:04] up I dan with the
[37:09] devil in
[37:11] the how the heaven did I
[37:18] get all I was trou
[37:27] [Música]
[37:32] And the freedom I was
[37:35] chasing fell like
[37:38] prison. Oh Lord, I've done so many
[37:42] things wish I
[37:46] did. And after all the risky business,
[37:51] could I ever be forgiven?
[37:54] I'm afraid to even ask to come
[38:00] back cuz I went running like a
[38:04] rev up death I couldn't pay I went
[38:09] dancing with the
[38:11] devil with one in the grave. How the
[38:16] heaven I get here when threw it all
[38:20] away.
[38:21] All I've given you is trouble. All you
[38:26] given me is
[38:32] grace. Giving me is grace.
[38:36] [Música]
[38:39] And when I sobered up and came back to
[38:44] my
[38:46] senses, I was too far gone to make up
[38:51] all the distance.
[38:54] I gambled all that I've been given. I
[38:58] was broke alone and wishing that I could
[39:03] turn around and go
[39:08] back. When I heard the sound of
[39:12] footsteps down the
[39:15] road and you came running like a
[39:19] revid off death I couldn't.
[39:23] You went dancing with the devil. Sent
[39:27] that liar to his grave. How the heaven
[39:32] did I get here? Every sin has been
[39:36] erased. All I've given you is trouble.
[39:40] All you given me is great.
[39:46] [Música]
[39:55] There is something
[39:58] the always through
[40:02] my very deeper than the
[40:06] rubble is my
[40:10] daddy's
[40:13] DNA. Gracias.
[40:29] Aleluya.
[40:41] Amén.
[41:02] I speak the name of Jesus over
[41:09] you. In

[41:22] can

[41:27] desperation, I'll seek heaven.
[41:30] And I pray this for you. I pray for your
[41:36] healing. The circumstances will
[41:40] change. I pray that the fear inside will
[41:44] flee in Jesus
[41:48] name. I pray that a break
[41:52] through what happened today.
[41:57] I pray miracles over your life in Jesus
[42:09] name. Speak the name of all
[42:15] authority. Declaring blessings every

[44:38] [Música]

[45:02] Amen. Oración.
[45:16] [Música]
[45:26] I read in the paper another
[45:32] earthquake torn the
[45:35] land.
[45:37] Bam is out
[45:40] of control.
[45:45] There is
[45:47] fighting and
[45:49] dying. There is sin on every
[45:54] hand. Where it ends the minds of men
[45:59] just don't
[46:03] know. God's got
[46:07] everything
[46:09] under control.
[46:14] He's still
[46:15] God. He's in
[46:18] charge of it
[46:22] all. I can sleep just like a
[46:27] baby. I've got peace down in my
[46:32] soul. God's got
[46:35] everything
[46:37] under control.
[46:43] Now your
[46:44] valy may seem
[46:47] dark and your
[46:49] mountain also
[46:51] high and you come to the end of your
[47:01] own. Just look up to Jesus.
[47:07] He's
[47:08] standing close by and he's
[47:12] got everything
[47:15] under
[47:20] control. God's got
[47:23] everything
[47:25] under
[47:28] [Música]
[47:29] control. He's still God.
[47:33] He's in charge of it
[47:38] all. I can't sleep just like a
[47:43] baby. I've got peace down in my
[47:48] soul. God's got everything
[47:53] under
[47:56] control. Oh, God's got everything.
[48:03] under
[48:07] control. He's still
[48:09] God. He's in charge of it
[48:16] all. I can't sleep just like a
[48:21] baby. I've got peace down in my soul.
[48:27] God's got
[48:29] everything under
[48:35] control. Oh, God's got everything
[48:40] under
[48:45] [Música]
[48:47] [Aplausos]
[48:51] control. Pueden poner de pie.
[48:56] Hemos llegado a lo más importante del
[49:00] servicio, escuchar directamente el trono
[49:03] de
[49:04] Dios. Es un privilegio, un
[49:07] honor introducir nuestro
[49:09] pastor. ¿Cuántos vinieron
[49:14] esperando escuchando cosas grandes en
[49:17] esta mañana?
[49:23] Oh, there are some
[49:29] things I may not
[49:34] know. There are some
[49:39] places that I may not
[49:44] go. How many are sure this morning? But
[49:48] I am
[49:50] sure all of this one
[49:56] thing. Oh my God is real. Oh I can feel
[50:04] him deep
[50:08] with Oh my God is real.
[50:14] Oh, he's so real in
[50:18] [Aplausos]
[50:18] [Música]
[50:20] my God is real. Oh, for he
[50:26] has and made me whole.
[50:30] Oh, his love for
[50:36] me is
[50:40] like oh my God is real. Oh, for I can
[50:48] feel him in my soul.
[50:53] Some folks
[50:56] [Música]
[50:58] made some folks may
[51:03] score. Some may deserve me and leave me
[51:12] alone. Come on now, church. Oh, but ask
[51:17] for
[51:20] me. I'll
[51:24] take Oh my God is real.
[51:30] for I can feel him deep
[51:36] [Aplausos]
[51:38] [Música]
[51:40] with Oh, he's so real in my
[51:47] soul. My God is real. Oh, for he
[51:53] has and made
[51:58] me his love for
[52:03] me is
[52:08] like my God is real for I can feel him
[52:16] and be to my soul.
[52:24] [Música]
[52:26] Am al Señor esta
[52:28] mañana están contentos estar en la casa
[52:31] del
[52:34] Señor. Podemos estar en muchos lugares,
[52:36] pero ese es el mejor lugar donde
[52:40] está. Nos saludamos en el nombre del
[52:42] Señor Jesucristo esta mañana tan fina.
[52:47] Los que están en internet, Dios les
[52:49] bendiga donde quiera que
[52:50] estén. Estamos contentos de tenerlos
[52:53] aquí con nosotros.
[52:56] Queremos decir felicidades.
[53:01] Ha sido un par de semanas,
[53:05] pero el hermano Santiago, la hermana
[53:07] María
[53:08] Paz, Abril Pérez Brñoño, sobre el
[53:12] nacimiento de su hija Abril Pérez
[53:15] Briseño.
[53:18] [Aplausos]
[53:20] [Música]
[53:24] Qué palabra maravillosa tenemos delante
[53:26] de
[53:29] nosotros y decidí sacar una página
[53:34] delio del hermano
[53:36] [Música]
[53:41] Jimmy. El mensaje es estableciendo la
[53:44] palabra número
[53:48] tres con subtítulo todo el infierno está
[53:50] en contra de este
[53:52] mensaje. Pero aquí
[53:55] lo vamos a poner
[54:00] subtítulo. Este mensaje está en contra
[54:03] todo el infierno.
[54:08] Vamos a entrar a la palabra.
[54:13] Si son tan
[54:16] amables, el libro de San
[54:21] Mateo, capítulo 16, muy conocido.
[54:28] Mateo 16 verso 18.
[54:34] Cuando lo tengas, si puede decir amén.
[54:40] Yo también te
[54:41] digo que tú eres
[54:44] Pedro. Sobre esta
[54:47] roca
[54:51] edificaré o la palabra edificar ahí
[54:53] significa
[54:56] establecer. Edificaré, estableceré mi
[54:59] iglesia.
[55:05] Las puertas heladas no prevalecerán
[55:08] contra
[55:11] él. No importa si todo el infierno está
[55:13] en contra de este
[55:16] mensaje. Con que la palabra esté
[55:19] establecida, no puede prevalecer contra
[55:22] él. ¿Cuántos lo creen?
[55:26] Y aquí es donde vamos a ir hoy.
[55:29] Est de buen ánimo.
[55:33] Dios les bendiga. Pueden tomar su
[55:34] asiento
[55:38] cuando hacemos la
[55:43] pregunta. ¿Cuántos son el mensaje?
[55:50] Amén. Amén.
[55:54] La mayoría dice, "Amén."
[55:59] Si todo el infierno está en contra del
[56:02] mensaje, entonces todo el infierno está
[56:04] en contra usted y
[56:07] yo. ¿Por qué nos
[56:10] sorprendemos cuando el infierno viene
[56:12] contra nosotros?
[56:19] que no debemos estar en expectativa.
[56:26] No solo se van a cruzar los brazos que
[56:28] hagan lo que ellos
[56:31] quieran. La
[56:33] consolación, la consolación es que hemos
[56:35] sido
[56:37] establecidos sobre la
[56:39] revelación de quién él es en nosotros.
[56:48] Lo puede dejar en la revelación quién él
[56:51] es, pero tenemos que ir un paso
[56:54] más. ¿Quién él es en nosotros?
[57:01] Las puertas dees no pueden prevalecer
[57:09] contra leer una cita. Cristo es el
[57:11] misterio de Dios revelado mientras
[57:13] empezamos aquí.
[57:16] y le de esta manera. No sé si lo
[57:26] tieno que la
[57:30] tenemos, pero esto es Cristo, es el
[57:32] misterio de Dios revelado. Esto es lo
[57:35] que
[57:36] dice. Todo el
[57:39] infierno está contra esta enseñanza.
[57:47] Todo, todo el infierno está contra el
[57:52] mensaje. Todo el infierno está en contra
[57:54] de esta
[57:58] enseñanza. Todo el infierno está contra
[58:01] la verdad.
[58:07] Dígale a su
[58:11] vecino. Primero, todo el infierno está
[58:14] contra enseñanza. Todo el infierno está
[58:16] contra esta enseñanza. ¿Qué
[58:19] enseñanza? La enseñanza del séptimo
[58:21] ángel. Lo que trajo el
[58:26] mensaje. Todo el infierno está contra
[58:28] esta verdad. Dígale
[58:31] eso todo el infierno está contra esta
[58:33] verdad.
[58:36] Pero dice, "Pero es la
[58:39] verdad." Y luego dice, "Jesús nunca
[58:41] dijo,
[58:43] Pedro, tú y
[58:45] Juan y todo el resto del
[58:48] pueblo. Ustedes tienen la
[58:51] revelación. Ahora toda la iglesia es
[58:53] salva.
[58:56] No fue a él
[59:00] personalmente. Te digo a
[59:03] ti, no a
[59:05] ellos, sino te digo a
[59:08] ti que tú eres
[59:12] Pedro y sobre esta roca edificaré mi
[59:16] iglesia. Y la palabra Pedro significa
[59:18] una piedra.
[59:21] Piedra significa el
[59:24] confesado o el
[59:27] separado sobre cierta
[59:30] piedra, sobre cierta cosa. Ve llamados
[59:35] fuera. La iglesia llamada
[59:37] fuera sobre esta
[59:40] piedra, sobre esta
[59:43] revelación. Carne y sangre nunca se lo
[59:45] reveló.
[59:47] Pero sobre esta
[59:49] revelación, grupo llamado
[59:52] fuera, edificaré mi iglesia en
[59:57] ellos y las puertas de no van a poder ir
[1:00:00] contra
[1:00:04] ella. Ningún pelo sobre su cabeza va a
[1:00:06] perecer.
[1:00:10] Ningún cabello sobre su cabeza va a
[1:00:13] perecer porque tú eres
[1:00:18] mío. Te levantaré en el último
[1:00:21] día y os daré vida
[1:00:25] eterna. Lo levantaré en el último
[1:00:28] día. Ahí
[1:00:30] está la revelación.
[1:00:33] No ellos, pero él un individuo, no un
[1:00:38] grupo, un
[1:00:41] individuo y todo el infierno está contra
[1:00:47] él. ¿Qué estamos haciendo cuando salimos
[1:00:50] a estos países para predicar el
[1:00:54] evangelio? Simplemente yendo para
[1:00:57] establecer la palabra.
[1:01:01] Estamos estableciendo el reino de Dios
[1:01:02] en ellos.
[1:01:06] puede ver porque todo el infierno está
[1:01:08] en contra de lo que estamos
[1:01:12] haciendo, porque simplemente somos una
[1:01:14] amenaza a su
[1:01:16] reino. Dígale a su
[1:01:18] vecino,
[1:01:21] "Vecino, somos una amenaza a su reino.
[1:01:28] Suficiente es suficiente de estar
[1:01:31] asustado. Oh, todo el infierno está en
[1:01:33] contra. ¿Y
[1:01:35] qué? Si está
[1:01:38] establecido, no importa si todo el
[1:01:40] infierno está en
[1:01:42] contra, ni un
[1:01:44] cabello se
[1:01:48] perderá. Ni un cabello en su en su
[1:01:50] cabeza puede ser dañado. Es lo que dice
[1:01:52] su palabra.
[1:01:56] aquellos que que han sido
[1:01:59] establecidos. Se pone esto muy
[1:02:02] bueno,
[1:02:04] rápidamente. Muchos van a
[1:02:07] África, muchos han ido con nosotros en
[1:02:10] viajes misioneros.
[1:02:13] Ahora escuche
[1:02:16] esto. No vamos para allá para establecer
[1:02:19] amistades.
[1:02:24] Hola. Aunque establecemos
[1:02:27] amistades, pero esa es no es la razón
[1:02:29] principal por que
[1:02:31] vamos. No vamos a establecer
[1:02:35] relaciones aunque son establecidas.
[1:02:45] Vamos a llegar algo bueno
[1:02:47] aquí, aunque todo esto
[1:02:51] pasa, pero es el establecimiento de la
[1:02:55] palabra. Es la razón por vamos.
[1:03:00] Mientras estamos estableciendo la
[1:03:03] palabra, se establecen relaciones y
[1:03:07] amistades, pero entiende de dónde
[1:03:12] vengo. No vamos a encontrar un mejor
[1:03:14] amigo allá. No, no,
[1:03:20] no. Lo más importante es que la palabra
[1:03:22] esté establecida en ellos.
[1:03:27] ¿Cómo vamos a establecer algo si
[1:03:29] nosotros mismos no estamos establecidos?
[1:03:37] Cuando algo ha sido establecido, usted
[1:03:38] no lo cuestiona.
[1:03:42] Amén.
[1:03:45] Si aún está cuestionando cosas, no está
[1:03:48] establecido. Hola a
[1:03:52] todos. Es lo que es.
[1:03:56] Y si lo que acontece en el campo
[1:04:00] misionero no se traslada su vida
[1:04:05] aquí, entonces en vano trabajan los
[1:04:07] labradores.
[1:04:16] No estamos aventando a nadie, estamos
[1:04:17] haciendo
[1:04:18] declaración o África te cambia.
[1:04:23] No, África no te cambia.
[1:04:26] Mucha gente vive en África y no han
[1:04:29] cambiado. Es la palabra que
[1:04:32] cambia. Es la palabra
[1:04:35] establecida cuando es colocada en su
[1:04:38] posición
[1:04:39] correcta. Eso trae un
[1:04:43] cambio que lo permite ir a alguien
[1:04:47] más y ayudar a establecer eso en ellos.
[1:04:54] A veces nos mezclamos con esas
[1:04:56] cosas, danzamos
[1:04:59] allá y gritamos allá.
[1:05:04] Hola. Danzamos, gritamos, tenemos un
[1:05:07] buen
[1:05:08] tiempo y llegamos a casa y no podemos
[1:05:11] decir amén en la iglesia.
[1:05:14] Vemos los
[1:05:17] videos. Están están danzando.
[1:05:20] Oh, tuvimos un buen
[1:05:22] tiempo. ¿Por qué lo dejó en
[1:05:26] [Aplausos]
[1:05:29] África? ¿Por qué eso no está siendo
[1:05:31] producido
[1:05:32] aquí? Nos quedamos atorados allá. No lo
[1:05:36] deje
[1:05:37] allá. Si tuvo una experiencia allá,
[1:05:40] alabado sea Dios. Pero traiga, tráigalas
[1:05:43] de
[1:05:45] regreso. Me pongo un poco en fuego sobre
[1:05:47] estas
[1:05:50] cosas. No puede ir allá y ser una clase
[1:05:53] de
[1:05:54] persona reclamando que se para con el
[1:05:58] mensaje y llegar a casa y ser otra clase
[1:06:00] de
[1:06:02] persona que no sabe que es bien o mal,
[1:06:05] que es o no es, no sabe dónde está
[1:06:08] parado, está todo adentro. o
[1:06:11] no. ¿Por qué ir alrededor? No hay entre
[1:06:17] medio. Si todo el mundo se va en contra
[1:06:21] de este mensaje,
[1:06:24] escúcheme, si todo el mundo se viera
[1:06:28] contra el mensaje, aún lo
[1:06:30] [Aplausos]
[1:06:32] creería. Aún lo
[1:06:37] predico, porque es lo que ha sido
[1:06:38] establecido en mí.
[1:06:42] Si todo el mundo va en contra del
[1:06:43] hermano Branham, yo aún lo voy a
[1:06:50] seguir. Quiero que venga
[1:06:52] conmigo. Aún me pararé con él. Aún lo
[1:06:55] voy a seguir. Aún voy a predicar el
[1:06:58] mensaje. Porque es lo que fue
[1:07:00] establecido dentro de
[1:07:02] mí. Yo no estoy buscando nada más.
[1:07:08] Lo hemos encontrado.
[1:07:13] Aleluya. Voy a leer la cita de nuevo. La
[1:07:16] cosa
[1:07:17] es en el el Edén de
[1:07:22] Satanás. Hoy no tratamos de establecer
[1:07:24] la palabra de Dios en el corazón del
[1:07:26] pueblo. Estamos queriendo establecernos
[1:07:29] a nosotros
[1:07:31] mismos. Las iglesias quieren establecer
[1:07:33] la doctrina de la iglesia. En el corazón
[1:07:36] de la
[1:07:38] persona, somos mandados establecer la
[1:07:40] palabra de
[1:07:42] Dios. Establecer significa actuarla,
[1:07:46] demostrarla,
[1:07:49] manifestarla, es traer la
[1:07:52] existencia y colocándola en su
[1:07:55] lugar. Le voy a dar unas claves hoy. Las
[1:07:59] va a
[1:08:00] necesitar. Las va a necesitar en su
[1:08:02] jornada.
[1:08:05] Los jóvenes, los más grandes, no importa
[1:08:06] qué edad
[1:08:09] tengan, lo que debemos establecer en el
[1:08:12] corazón del
[1:08:13] pueblo es Cristo la
[1:08:19] palabra. Lo que debemos establecer en el
[1:08:21] corazón del pueblo es la
[1:08:25] palabra y la palabra es una persona.
[1:08:31] ¿Puede ver la diferencia?
[1:08:35] o le voy a presentar nuestra
[1:08:38] doctrina o nuestra
[1:08:41] iglesia o le vamos a presentar la
[1:08:45] persona. Cuando yo vengo a
[1:08:48] alguien y
[1:08:49] digo, "Oh, tenemos la verdad en nuestra
[1:08:52] iglesia."
[1:08:54] Y la gente dice, "Todos dicen
[1:08:57] eso, pero no pueden
[1:09:01] negarlo. Cuando la misma vida de
[1:09:03] Jesucristo está en una
[1:09:06] persona y camina y le da esa
[1:09:09] vida, esas son las obras
[1:09:12] mayores, impartir vida
[1:09:14] eterna, que es la vida de
[1:09:17] Cristo. Cuando puede impartir la
[1:09:21] persona, ahora tiene algo.
[1:09:25] religión se avienta por la
[1:09:29] ventana y ahora llega la persona a la
[1:09:33] escena. Es lo que estamos estableciendo
[1:09:35] en corazones del pueblo. Están
[1:09:41] conmigo. Cuando la persona es
[1:09:46] establecida, él va entonces establecer
[1:09:49] la doctrina correcta.
[1:09:51] Tienes que tener
[1:09:52] doctrina, si no cualquier viento lo va a
[1:09:55] llevar, pero no ponga la doctrina antes
[1:09:58] de la
[1:10:00] persona. ¿Me
[1:10:04] entiende? Él va a establecer la doctrina
[1:10:07] correcta, el ministerio correcto, el
[1:10:10] reino correcto en
[1:10:12] nosotros. Isaías
[1:10:15] 55:11. Así será mi palabra.
[1:10:19] [Música]
[1:10:20] que sale de mi
[1:10:24] boca no volverá a mí vacía.
[1:10:30] A
[1:10:31] veces salimos con una
[1:10:34] palabra, pero si es la palabra de Dios,
[1:10:36] no puede regresar
[1:10:39] vacía, sino que
[1:10:41] hará lo que yo
[1:10:46] quiero y será prosperada en aquello para
[1:10:49] que la envié.
[1:10:53] Establecer la palabra es la
[1:10:56] acción y cumplir es el resultado.
[1:11:04] Esto es fácil. A
[1:11:07] veces el establecer es la acción de
[1:11:09] ello, pero el
[1:11:14] cumplirlo son los resultados, el
[1:11:16] cumplimiento de lo que ha sido
[1:11:20] establecido, pero donde la palabra de
[1:11:22] Dios no es
[1:11:24] establecida, entonces nada es logrado o
[1:11:29] cumplido. Por eso decía el hermano
[1:11:33] Henry yendo allá a
[1:11:36] Uganda y ve todos estos edificios y
[1:11:39] nunca están
[1:11:44] terminados. Ya casi
[1:11:47] terminaban. Así es. Casi acababan tan
[1:11:50] cerca.
[1:11:56] un par de miles de dólares y casi
[1:11:59] terminan de Pero los trabajadores,
[1:12:02] laboradores, los que estaban
[1:12:04] edificando, nunca contaron los el costo
[1:12:09] antes de empezar.
[1:12:17] Cada palabra que viene de la el bocado
[1:12:20] de Dios, la la boca de Dios, que es el
[1:12:26] profeta, será establecido y
[1:12:31] cumplido. Voy a brincar esta parte
[1:12:34] aquí. No nos queremos terminar el tiempo
[1:12:37] aquí.
[1:12:41] Ahora note
[1:12:44] esto, debemos estudiar para ser
[1:12:46] aprobados.
[1:12:50] ¿Cuántos de ustedes
[1:12:54] estudian? ¿Cuántos de ustedes estudian
[1:12:56] la
[1:12:57] Biblia? ¿Cuántos estudian el mensaje?
[1:13:04] Queremos asegurarnos que estamos en la
[1:13:06] iglesia del
[1:13:08] mensaje. Aunque estudiamos y hacemos
[1:13:10] nuestra parte, la escritura también
[1:13:14] dice, "Estas siempre están
[1:13:18] aprendiendo y nunca pueden llegar al
[1:13:20] conocimiento de la
[1:13:23] verdad." ¿Qué es este conocimiento de la
[1:13:25] verdad?
[1:13:29] Jesús dijo, "Yo soy el camino, la verdad
[1:13:31] y la vida."
[1:13:33] El conocimiento de la
[1:13:35] verdad no está basado en cuánto usted
[1:13:39] sabe, pero en su relación con la
[1:13:43] verdad y la verdad es una
[1:13:51] persona. Mi pregunta a los jóvenes que
[1:13:53] están acá
[1:13:55] enfrente. ¿Cuántos tienen una relación
[1:13:57] con la verdad?
[1:14:00] Sí.
[1:14:03] Yo oro que la tengan, pero por eso
[1:14:05] estamos
[1:14:06] aquí. Vamos a llegar algo bueno
[1:14:11] aquí. Entonces, establecer la
[1:14:16] palabra. Estamos
[1:14:18] estableciendo la persona de Cristo en el
[1:14:21] corazón del
[1:14:24] pueblo. Queremos continuar a encontrar
[1:14:26] dónde estamos.
[1:14:29] Exact. ¿Cuántos creen que ya no estamos
[1:14:31] en las edades de la iglesia?
[1:14:37] Algunos no saben o no quieren contestar.
[1:14:40] Déjeme ver sus
[1:14:42] manos. ¿Cuántos de ustedes aún están en
[1:14:44] las edades de la iglesia?
[1:14:47] Nadie va a decir que sí.
[1:14:50] Muy bien,
[1:14:52] está
[1:14:53] bien. Eso es bueno.
[1:14:58] Cuando vemos
[1:14:59] esto, no
[1:15:03] debemos, pero muchas veces nuestras
[1:15:05] acciones, nuestras tradiciones, nuestras
[1:15:09] vidas muestran que aún estamos en la
[1:15:12] odisea. Alguna parte de nosotros aún
[1:15:15] está
[1:15:16] ahí.
[1:15:20] Usted revísese
[1:15:23] Apocalipsis 41. Aquí vamos.
[1:15:28] Oro que sea una bendición que le
[1:15:32] ayude. Sabemos que es un libro de
[1:15:35] símbolos. Decimos
[1:15:38] estas, pero así aprendemos como humanos.
[1:15:41] Apocalipsis libro
[1:15:42] de libro de símbolos.
[1:15:46] All right. After this I looked and
[1:15:48] behold door was open heaven and voice
[1:15:52] was
[1:15:57] talking después de esto miré y aquí
[1:15:59] puerta abierta en el cielo y la primera
[1:16:01] voz que oí como de trompeta hablando
[1:16:02] conmigo dijo, "Sube acá y yo te mostraré
[1:16:05] las cosas que sucederán después de
[1:16:08] estas. Hay demasiado
[1:16:12] ahí. No lo ponga. Yo les digo
[1:16:15] cuando hay demasiado
[1:16:19] aquí, recuerden, leímos Apocalipsis
[1:16:25] 8. En cada verso nos podemos quedar
[1:16:28] horas y horas
[1:16:30] ahí. Podemos desmeduzar este verso aquí.
[1:16:35] Está bien.
[1:16:38] Y pueden poner el primer
[1:16:41] retrato aquí después de
[1:16:44] esto, el hermano Branham dice todas
[1:16:47] estas
[1:16:50] cosas, pero mire como el verso se hacer
[1:16:53] vida y va a ir a usted.
[1:16:57] Después de eso, después de
[1:16:59] qué. El hermano Abraham dice, después de
[1:17:01] las edades de la iglesia.
[1:17:07] Las edades son capítulo 2, capítulo 3
[1:17:09] del libro. Estamos en capítulo
[1:17:12] 4. Después de esto de las
[1:17:15] edades, yo miré y he
[1:17:21] aquí cuando usted mira
[1:17:24] algo, algo se le ha abierto o no lo
[1:17:27] estaría
[1:17:31] viendo. Algo se me abrió y aquí
[1:17:35] significa que algo captó su atención.
[1:17:38] He
[1:17:40] aquí. ¿Qué?
[1:17:43] ¿Qué? He aquí es tomar su atención,
[1:17:46] ponerlo en algo. He
[1:17:48] aquí el hermano Aarón acaba de entrar y
[1:17:51] todos miran. O ahí está el hermano
[1:17:54] Aarón.
[1:17:56] Mire, algo se me fue abierto que captó
[1:17:59] mi atención.
[1:18:03] El hermano Branham dijo, "Nunca entendí
[1:18:05] como una puerta puede ser un hombre.
[1:18:07] Un hombre puede ser una
[1:18:10] puerta. Algo captó mi
[1:18:14] atención. Una puerta de una persona, un
[1:18:19] hombre fue abierto o
[1:18:21] revelado en el
[1:18:23] cielo, que es la dimensión de la
[1:18:26] palabra, la dimensión de logos.
[1:18:33] El siguiente
[1:18:34] retrato y la primer voz, ¿qué fue la
[1:18:38] primer voz? La palabra
[1:18:41] hablada que yo oí.
[1:18:44] Fe viene por
[1:18:46] oír lo primero o la palabra
[1:18:50] hablada que trajo
[1:18:59] fe o en otras palabras fue la voz de
[1:19:02] Dios dirigida a mí. ¿Cuántos lo están
[1:19:04] captando?
[1:19:06] tiene que entrar aquí
[1:19:10] conmigo. Fue como si fuera una trompeta
[1:19:12] hablando
[1:19:14] contigo. Era la voz de Dios dirigida a
[1:19:17] mí. La palabra hablada trajo
[1:19:20] fe y era la voz de Dios directamente a
[1:19:25] mí y dijo, "Sube acá."
[1:19:32] En otras palabras, me estaba invitando a
[1:19:34] una dimensión más alta de la
[1:19:36] palabra y te mostraré.
[1:19:41] Eso significa, te voy a
[1:19:43] revelar las cosas que sucederán después
[1:19:46] de
[1:19:48] estas eventos que acontecerán después de
[1:19:51] las
[1:19:53] edades. Si no estamos en las edades de
[1:19:55] la
[1:19:56] iglesia, estamos en el después.
[1:20:01] Vamos.
[1:20:03] ¿Cuántos están en las
[1:20:06] edades? ¿Cuántos han salido de las
[1:20:08] edades?
[1:20:10] Estamos
[1:20:11] viviendo en el
[1:20:14] después. Dígale a su vecino,
[1:20:18] "Vecino, estamos viviendo en el
[1:20:21] después."
[1:20:27] Ahora vamos a leer esta escritura. Así
[1:20:29] es,
[1:20:31] exactamente. Así es.
[1:20:33] Exactamente. Después de las edades de la
[1:20:37] iglesia, algo se me fue abierto que
[1:20:39] captó mi atención.
[1:20:42] Un hombre se me fue
[1:20:44] revelado en la dimensión de la
[1:20:48] palabra y la palabra hablada que trajo
[1:20:53] fe la voz de
[1:20:55] Dios dirigida a
[1:20:59] mí, invitándome a una dimensión más alta
[1:21:02] de la
[1:21:04] palabra para revelar a mí los
[1:21:09] eventos que iban a acontecer después de
[1:21:11] las
[1:21:12] edades en mi tiempo.
[1:21:16] [Aplausos]
[1:21:19] Dios les
[1:21:23] bendiga. No necesitas nada
[1:21:25] más. Ese es el mensaje.
[1:21:28] Ahí podemos cantar un himno e ir a casa
[1:21:31] y decir, "Alabado sea
[1:21:33] Dios." ¿A quién le está hablando? ¿A
[1:21:36] Juan? ¿Quién es Juan? Usted y yo somos
[1:21:39] Juan.
[1:21:41] Es la
[1:21:42] novia. Se lo dice a la
[1:21:45] novia. Le estoy invitando,
[1:21:48] venga, entre a mi
[1:21:50] palabra. Te voy a mostrar un hombre.
[1:21:53] ¿Quién es este hombre?
[1:21:55] el hombre llamado Cristo
[1:21:58] Jesús, la revelación de quién él es en
[1:22:01] nosotros ahora
[1:22:03] mismo. Es lo que está mostrando.
[1:22:07] nos está
[1:22:12] mostrando y más allá del
[1:22:15] escalofrío y sentarnos un poco aquí,
[1:22:19] pero me gusta eso cuando el Espíritu
[1:22:21] Santo lo lo
[1:22:24] trae yo, Señor, estoy mucho más
[1:22:28] enamorado contigo personal.
[1:22:32] Recuerde, no estamos estableciendo
[1:22:33] ninguna doctrina, un credo, sino la
[1:22:36] persona. Cuando ves la
[1:22:38] persona y a estar consciente de la
[1:22:41] persona o qué relación
[1:22:44] es lo que estamos trayendo a la
[1:22:50] iglesia. Mire, esto me me capta.
[1:22:55] Quiero colocar todo esto
[1:22:57] bien. Es la razón que esta puerta
[1:23:00] abierta en el
[1:23:01] cielo era de sima
[1:23:06] importancia, porque solo en esta
[1:23:08] persona encontraremos nuestro lugar,
[1:23:12] nuestra posición, nuestra herencia,
[1:23:15] nuestro
[1:23:17] propósito. Este es el conocimiento de la
[1:23:20] verdad.
[1:23:24] En el mensaje Apocalipsis capítulo 4
[1:23:27] parte
[1:23:28] 3, nada es por coincidencia. Mire lo que
[1:23:31] dice el hermano
[1:23:33] Branham. Acabamos de leer Apocalipsis
[1:23:39] 41. Dice, "Ahora capte el capítulo 4 del
[1:23:42] libro de
[1:23:45] Apocalipsis y para el reloj.
[1:24:00] No puedo leer ni siquiera una oración. Y
[1:24:05] las edades son tiempo.
[1:24:08] Apocalipsis 4:1. Estamos saliendo de
[1:24:11] tiempo a la eternidad.
[1:24:13] Le está diciendo
[1:24:16] aquí, obtenga Apocalipsis capítulo 4 y
[1:24:20] va a detener el tiempo, el reloj.
[1:24:27] que no se cansa del reloj, sigue
[1:24:30] sigue, miro en el espejo, estoy
[1:24:33] envejeciendo, está viendo un retrato de
[1:24:35] mí ayer.
[1:24:41] No, no, no, no, nada mal, nada mal.
[1:24:44] Y miré en el espejo,
[1:24:47] uh, muy lejos de lo que era.
[1:24:53] Pero Dios tiene un retrato de ti.
[1:24:57] Aleluya.
[1:24:58] Tengo un
[1:25:00] cuerpo. Su vecino, tengo un
[1:25:04] cuerpo. No importa que tan viejos usted.
[1:25:07] Usted tiene un
[1:25:08] cuerpo. nos ha preparado un
[1:25:11] cuerpo que no
[1:25:14] vuestras. Cree en Dios, entonces cree en
[1:25:19] mí. En la casa de mi padre muchas
[1:25:21] mansiones hay. ¿Qué son esas
[1:25:23] mansiones? Es tu cuerpo. A donde va a ir
[1:25:26] usted.
[1:25:31] Aleluya. Promesas benditas que
[1:25:35] tenemos entr en la dimensión de la
[1:25:37] palabra. es lo que le está
[1:25:40] diciendo. La gente no quiere entrar en
[1:25:42] la dimensión de la
[1:25:44] palabra. Les gusta ir a la cuarta
[1:25:46] dimensión todo el
[1:25:51] tiempo. La gente piensa que atacamos
[1:25:54] ciertas
[1:25:55] cosas. Ahora, ¿cuántos
[1:25:58] honesto, cuántos ven más televisión de
[1:26:01] lo que lee su Biblia?
[1:26:04] No, todos abajo.
[1:26:07] ¿Qué pregunta? Es una buena pregunta.
[1:26:12] Oh, pero leo mi Biblia en el
[1:26:17] celular con todas esas funciones de
[1:26:21] demonios saliendo que está
[1:26:24] recibiendo. Están bloqueando toda
[1:26:26] revelación que puede salir de ahí.
[1:26:28] Vamos a entrar ahí en un
[1:26:30] momento. Usted sabe lo que estoy
[1:26:34] diciendo. Usted va y el reloj para
[1:26:37] cuando entra en la palabra porque es
[1:26:40] eternidad.
[1:26:43] Mira, vamos a ir de criaturas de
[1:26:46] tiempo, criaturas de las edades de la
[1:26:49] iglesia, a criaturas de
[1:26:53] eternidad. Pero no, ¿por qué no quisiera
[1:26:55] entrar en la palabra?
[1:26:57] Estamos muy
[1:26:59] atorados, preocupados de todo y y todo
[1:27:02] lo que la pregunta usted, la
[1:27:06] respuesta, la respuesta a nuestras
[1:27:08] familias está en Cristo la
[1:27:13] palabra. ¿Por qué no nos vamos a basear
[1:27:15] completamente en
[1:27:18] esto? ¿Usted sabe de lo que estoy
[1:27:20] hablando, estamos en la iglesia?
[1:27:25] Sí. Usted
[1:27:27] sabe cuando no estamos en el
[1:27:33] servicio, este predicador va muy
[1:27:40] largo. Oh, dijo que ya casi terminamos y
[1:27:43] luego ya entramos en la palabra. Oh,
[1:27:45] amén. Gloria.
[1:27:48] Pero ni siquiera saben lo que está
[1:27:49] siendo hablado
[1:27:51] cuando está en la palabra.
[1:27:56] El reloj para
[1:28:02] cuando está en ello, está en
[1:28:05] eternidad. No le importa si predican 5
[1:28:08] horas. El hombre carnal está viendo el
[1:28:11] tiempo, pero el hombre
[1:28:13] espiritual, déjame aquí en este lugar,
[1:28:16] déjame en esta dimensión.
[1:28:20] Tengo que obtener que mi relación esté
[1:28:22] más profunda con
[1:28:28] Cristo. Está en la palabra el tiempo va
[1:28:30] tan
[1:28:32] rápido. El domingo
[1:28:34] antepasado era una hora y 45
[1:28:38] minutos. Y alguien algunos dijeron, "No,
[1:28:42] no, no
[1:28:44] parecía los pobres niños en la escuela
[1:28:46] dominical.
[1:28:50] La imitación de Juan, tipo de la
[1:28:54] novia, esa imitación fuera para subir a
[1:28:57] una esfera más
[1:28:59] alta, una esfera más
[1:29:02] alta, una dimensión de la palabra más
[1:29:07] alta, algo que no fue disponible a las
[1:29:09] edades de la iglesia.
[1:29:14] Estoy
[1:29:18] diciendo, tenemos que abrir nuestros
[1:29:20] ojos a la realidad dónde estamos
[1:29:21] viviendo, dónde estamos
[1:29:25] ahora. Encontrarnos en en la
[1:29:28] escritura, las cosas que que
[1:29:32] examinaron, que predicaron con
[1:29:34] revelación
[1:29:37] parcial, ahora será revelada bajo el
[1:29:40] ministerio del séptimo ángel.
[1:29:44] Esto no se trata de una puerta mágica de
[1:29:49] Narnia, una puerta que lo lleva a una
[1:29:52] tierra
[1:29:53] mágica, ¿no? Esta es la
[1:29:57] puerta, la entrada a la
[1:29:59] [Aplausos]
[1:30:03] persona, la entrada a Cristo, la
[1:30:07] palabra, la espera del logos.
[1:30:13] Es nuestro trabajo conectarnos a esa
[1:30:19] persona. Juan 14:19 todavía un poco. Y
[1:30:23] el mundo, que es el cosmos, que son las
[1:30:27] edades, no me verá
[1:30:29] más. Pero vosotros me veréis, porque yo
[1:30:33] vivo, vosotros también viviréis. Y en
[1:30:36] aquel día, ¿cuál día?
[1:30:40] Aquellos que han subido más alto ahora
[1:30:42] mismo, en aquel día, vosotros
[1:30:46] conoceréis que yo estoy en mi
[1:30:49] Padre, vosotros en mí y yo en vosotros.
[1:30:55] Es las dimensiones que están
[1:30:57] entrelazando.
[1:31:00] [Música]
[1:31:03] El cielo consiste de la
[1:31:06] palabra, que es Cristo, la palabra
[1:31:08] ungida de la hora.
[1:31:11] Recuerde, no había
[1:31:13] cielo, no había séptima
[1:31:17] dimensión hasta que Dios se nació él
[1:31:20] mismo.
[1:31:28] No hubo tal cosa como el
[1:31:30] cielo hasta que él se
[1:31:33] nació y trajo la séptima
[1:31:37] dimensión, que es la el lugar de morada
[1:31:40] de Logos.
[1:31:46] Y finalmente hay un grupo de de
[1:31:49] personas se les ha dado
[1:31:54] entrada a esta
[1:32:02] persona. Podemos ir aquí
[1:32:09] por la revelación del libro
[1:32:14] abierto. El libro abierto, siete sellos
[1:32:16] que fueron
[1:32:19] abiertos. Esta es la razón que las
[1:32:22] puertas heladas no pueden
[1:32:25] prevalecer contra Cristo, la la iglesia
[1:32:28] de Dios establecida.
[1:32:31] Todo el
[1:32:33] infierno tendría que entrar a
[1:32:36] Cristo para encontrarnos.
[1:32:44] Tenemos que estar tan escondidos en
[1:32:47] Cristo que Satanás tuvo tendría que
[1:32:49] entrar en Cristo para
[1:32:52] encontrarnos y si entrara a Cristo sería
[1:32:55] nuestro hermano.
[1:33:03] Ya a estas alturas debemos estar en en
[1:33:06] lugares celestiales en
[1:33:07] Cristo si no estamos en la palabra.
[1:33:11] No estamos en lugares
[1:33:13] celestiales. Por eso es
[1:33:16] imposible entender la
[1:33:18] palabra sin
[1:33:20] revelación o fe. Es imposible.
[1:33:26] Cuando escucho gente decir, "No
[1:33:28] necesitamos un hombre que nos
[1:33:30] enseñe", que tienen el espíritu que les
[1:33:36] enseña. En las
[1:33:39] edades pensaban esas cosas.
[1:33:44] Por eso de una
[1:33:47] Biblia miles y miles de
[1:33:51] denominaciones, miles y miles de
[1:33:53] iglesias, grupos y sectas y
[1:33:58] entendimientos. Pero el mismo
[1:34:02] espíritu ha colocado en la iglesia
[1:34:05] maestros. Hebreos 42.
[1:34:12] Porque también a nosotros nos anunciado
[1:34:15] las buenas
[1:34:17] nuevas como a
[1:34:20] ellos, pero la palabra que fue
[1:34:23] predicada no les
[1:34:28] aprovechó por no ir acompañada de fe en
[1:34:30] los que la oyeron.
[1:34:35] Mucha gente piensa que es escuchar la
[1:34:37] palabra de cualquiera, que se trata de
[1:34:40] eso. Una mentira del
[1:34:44] Puedo leer la
[1:34:47] palabra, la misma palabra, alguien me la
[1:34:50] puede leer y
[1:34:51] predicar todo es igual, todo es lo
[1:34:54] mismo. No, no es lo
[1:34:58] mismo. Estoy dando claves ahorita.
[1:35:01] [Música]
[1:35:05] importa de dónde viene la palabra, de
[1:35:07] qué labios
[1:35:14] viene. Importa de qué labios viene la
[1:35:20] palabra, porque importa la unción que
[1:35:23] viene con ella.
[1:35:29] alguien que no vive una vida digna del
[1:35:32] evangelio y quieren decirle y
[1:35:35] predicarle y gente dice,
[1:35:39] "Oh,
[1:35:39] sí, sí,
[1:35:43] la palabra no tiene que estar ungida, la
[1:35:45] palabra ya está
[1:35:47] ungida, pero el que carga
[1:35:49] eso también tiene que estar ungido."
[1:35:58] importa de qué labios viene la palabra.
[1:36:07] Por
[1:36:08] eso está mal, aisla
[1:36:12] algo. Usted lo isla y y puede
[1:36:16] hacer tomar una escritura lo puede hacer
[1:36:18] que diga lo que esta escritura dice así.
[1:36:22] Yo lo
[1:36:23] creo. Tengo usted deshace toda la
[1:36:26] Biblia, la tiene que poner a un lado.
[1:36:28] Entonces, no solo escuchar, pero importa
[1:36:32] de qué labios
[1:36:34] vienen. Primera de Juan
[1:36:38] 2:27. Primera de Juan 2:27.
[1:36:45] Pero la unción que vosotros recibéis de
[1:36:50] él permanece en vosotros.
[1:36:55] En otras palabras, recibiste la palabra
[1:36:58] ungida habita en
[1:37:00] usted y no tenéis necesidad que nadie no
[1:37:03] os
[1:37:12] enseñe. ¿Dónde hemos fallado en
[1:37:16] entender que nunca fue el hermano
[1:37:18] Branam, el hermano Tomás, el hermano
[1:37:21] Caleb o cualquier otro?
[1:37:23] fue el espíritu de verdad que estaba
[1:37:28] predicando. ¿Recuerdo? Un gran hombre
[1:37:31] dijo, "Si la iglesia no se ha dado
[1:37:35] cuenta que no ha sido yo que los está
[1:37:40] guiando, pero ha sido el Espíritu Santo
[1:37:43] guiando a la
[1:37:44] iglesia." Y unos de estos
[1:37:46] días, cuando acabe
[1:37:48] conmigo, levantará otro
[1:37:51] vaso y aún sería el Espíritu Santo que
[1:37:54] estará guiando la iglesia.
[1:38:00] Pero la unción que vosotros recibéis de
[1:38:03] él, regrese a Apocalipsis
[1:38:06] 4:1. Cuando yo miré esa puerta abierta,
[1:38:09] ¿qué era? Un
[1:38:11] hombre fue
[1:38:12] abierto. ¿Quién fue este hombre? ¿O es
[1:38:16] Jesucristo? Pero, ¿qué es la revelación
[1:38:18] de ello?
[1:38:23] se va a quedar
[1:38:24] aquí, aquí
[1:38:26] flotando o va a ir más
[1:38:33] profundo. Necesidad que uno que os
[1:38:38] enseñe, pero la misma unción
[1:38:41] enseña,
[1:38:42] continúa, os enseña todas las cosas y su
[1:38:46] verdad y no es mentira.
[1:38:50] Y aún como os ha
[1:38:52] enseñado, habitaréis en él.
[1:38:56] Si lo is la puede decir lo que usted
[1:38:59] quiera, pero la unción que ha recibido
[1:39:02] de
[1:39:03] él, la la palabra él ahí es una e
[1:39:08] pequeña, es lo que habita en
[1:39:12] usted y no tenéis necesidad que alguien
[1:39:15] os
[1:39:18] enseñe, pero la misma unción que os
[1:39:20] enseña todas las
[1:39:23] cosas, si no necesitamos que nadie nos
[1:39:28] enseñe. ¿Por qué el mismo Espíritu Santo
[1:39:30] colocó en la iglesia
[1:39:32] maestros? Dice el hermano
[1:39:36] BR. En el mensaje Dios no llama un
[1:39:39] hombre a juicio antes de darle una
[1:39:42] advertiz. El maestro es un hombre
[1:39:44] especial.
[1:39:48] se sienta bajo la unción del
[1:39:51] Espíritu y puede traer traer las
[1:39:56] palabras y colocarlas juntas por el
[1:39:59] Espíritu
[1:40:00] Santo. Y si no me
[1:40:02] cree, pregúntele al
[1:40:09] Enuco. Cuando Felipe corre a
[1:40:13] él, el Enuco está leyendo el libro de
[1:40:18] Isaías y simplemente le
[1:40:22] pregunta, "¿Entiendes lo que
[1:40:25] lees?" Y dijo, "¿Cómo
[1:40:29] podré si no el espíritu me
[1:40:33] enseña?" No, no, no dice así.
[1:40:37] Hechos capítulo 8, si lo quieres
[1:40:39] escribir. ¿Cómo
[1:40:42] podré si alguno un hombre me
[1:40:47] enseñe? Él sabía que el espíritu usaba
[1:40:49] al
[1:40:51] hombre. El Dios está asociado con el
[1:40:54] hombre. No lo va a hacer de cualquier
[1:40:56] otra forma.
[1:41:00] Eh, la verdad, el
[1:41:04] asunto es que hay una unción que cada
[1:41:06] persona
[1:41:09] carga, está
[1:41:11] conectado a la naturaleza que está en el
[1:41:14] alma de esa
[1:41:20] persona. Cuando viene la
[1:41:23] palabra, tiene poder vivificador o no.
[1:41:29] Oh, hermanas, hermano, estaba
[1:41:30] reprendiendo a esos diablos, pero nada
[1:41:32] pasó. No hay poder vivificador
[1:41:37] ahí. ¿Qué dicen esa gente
[1:41:41] endemoniada? Conocemos a Pablo, a Jesús,
[1:41:44] pero ¿quién eres
[1:41:46] tú? Esto se pone en serio, muy
[1:41:52] rápido. ¿Qué naturaleza divina está
[1:41:55] apegada a la palabra que está siendo
[1:41:56] hablada?
[1:42:01] y lo trae una conexión con su teofanía.
[1:42:07] ¿Quieres la palabra establecida? Está
[1:42:12] saliendo. Ningún otro
[1:42:14] mensaje lo puede conectar a su
[1:42:18] teofanía, sino por este mensaje que fue
[1:42:21] traído por el séptimo ángel. Una iglesia
[1:42:23] no lo puede conectar a ellos. Un credo
[1:42:26] no lo puede conectar a
[1:42:28] ello. Nada lo puede
[1:42:32] conectar, sino la palabra que vino de la
[1:42:34] boca de
[1:42:38] Dios nos está restaurando de regreso a
[1:42:41] la imagen de
[1:42:43] Dios. Es el espíritu que
[1:42:46] vivifica y la carne nada
[1:42:50] aprovecha. Jesús dijo, "Las palabras que
[1:42:52] yo os he hablado son espíritu.
[1:42:55] y son
[1:42:59] vida. ¿Por qué es que tanta
[1:43:02] gente está tan limitado en revelación
[1:43:05] hoy en día?
[1:43:08] Porque limitamos nuestro
[1:43:10] entendimiento a lo que declaran nuestros
[1:43:13] ojos, al conocimiento que hemos
[1:43:16] acumulado, en vez de
[1:43:19] entender que fe viene por el
[1:43:23] oír y el oír de la palabra de Dios.
[1:43:30] Hubo un hombre una vez.
[1:43:39] El hermano Branham fue invitado a unas
[1:43:45] reuniones y las personas que organizaron
[1:43:49] estas reuniones eran trinitarios.
[1:43:54] Estos
[1:43:55] trinitarios le pidieron algo del hermano
[1:43:59] Branham. Dijeron, "Hermano
[1:44:01] Branham, cuando usted
[1:44:05] venga, por favor, no hable sobre la
[1:44:08] doctrina." Y el hermano Branham le dice
[1:44:11] a sus varones, a sus hombres, "Vayan a
[1:44:15] evangelizar, no prediquen doctrina."
[1:44:18] Hermano Branam pudo ir al primer
[1:44:22] servicio y uno de los hombres que estaba
[1:44:24] ahí con el hermano
[1:44:26] Branham predicó y lo soltó.
[1:44:31] Oh, y estaba predicando en
[1:44:34] contra y ese pastor
[1:44:39] estabaado, estaba
[1:44:42] enojado. Estaba al otro lado del
[1:44:44] enojado. El otro lado enojado.
[1:44:49] Estaba
[1:44:51] en él viene al hermano Branham.
[1:45:00] y le dijo, "Hermano, muy amable, le pedí
[1:45:01] que no entrara doctrina."
[1:45:07] Y el caballero que era el hermano Brah
[1:45:08] dijo, "Perdóneme, voy a hablar con él."
[1:45:10] Y en ese
[1:45:12] tiempo el hermano Branham entra en una
[1:45:16] visión y ve que este este pastor tiene
[1:45:19] una enfermedad venero. Venereo,
[1:45:25] hermano, yo veo que usted tiene una
[1:45:28] enfermedad y dije, hermano Branham, esto
[1:45:31] no puede salir afuera.
[1:45:33] Esto va a arruinar mi
[1:45:35] ministerio. La gente si si supieran
[1:45:39] esto y dijo, "No se preocupe, no va a
[1:45:44] salir, pero veo que no fue nada que tú
[1:45:47] hiciste que causó
[1:45:48] esto, pero es algo que cruzó por tu
[1:45:53] familia." Hermano Branham, ¿cómo supiste
[1:45:55] estas cosas?
[1:45:58] El hermano lo miró y
[1:46:01] dijo, "El mismo ángel que dijo que
[1:46:03] tienes este
[1:46:06] problema es el mismo ángel que me dijo
[1:46:09] que el trinitario es el
[1:46:12] ¿Cómo vas a luchar contra
[1:46:16] eso? El mismo
[1:46:21] ángelos parte porque nos encantamos de
[1:46:25] la sanidad y los servicios.
[1:46:28] Pero cuando se abre la palabra en su
[1:46:32] plenitud, los diablos se
[1:46:34] [Aplausos]
[1:46:39] esconden. Por eso la gente odia el
[1:46:42] mensaje, porque quita la
[1:46:48] cobertura, hace sentir incómodos.
[1:46:53] Aleluya.
[1:46:56] Si pensamos que lo podemos lograr por
[1:46:58] nosotros
[1:47:00] mismos, nunca captó la puerta que está
[1:47:02] abierta en el
[1:47:05] cielo. Fe entonces viene por el
[1:47:08] oír. ¿Está listo?
[1:47:11] Fe viene por el oír. Dígale a su vecino.
[1:47:13] Vecino, le estoy dando una
[1:47:16] clave. Es una clave grande para todos
[1:47:19] nosotros.
[1:47:22] vecino, fe viene por el oír. Viene por
[1:47:25] el oír. Muy bien. Ahora, dile, vecino,
[1:47:29] vecino,
[1:47:33] la duda también viene por el oír.
[1:47:41] Le voy a una una clave tan
[1:47:45] grande, se va a requerir que toda su
[1:47:47] familia la cargue al carro.
[1:47:50] Pero va a abrir muchas
[1:47:52] puertas y va a abrir otras
[1:47:55] puertas. Es una una llave que funciona
[1:47:59] en muchos lugares. ¿Cuántos están
[1:48:02] conmigo? Note,
[1:48:06] sí, fe viene por el
[1:48:08] oír, pero también la
[1:48:11] duda. Cuando vemos
[1:48:14] esto, esto explota.
[1:48:18] ¿A quién?
[1:48:19] Usted presta su oído,
[1:48:26] determina si usted está mezclando fe o
[1:48:28] duda con la
[1:48:31] palabra. Mire cómo descubrimos esto.
[1:48:36] Salimos del culto.
[1:48:40] Oh, no me gustó lo que dijo el
[1:48:41] predicador.
[1:48:44] Entramos a la casa.
[1:48:46] Oh, yo no creo nada de
[1:48:50] eso. Lo que hemos fallado en darnos
[1:48:54] cuenta, nuestros hijos, nuestros jóvenes
[1:48:57] están escuchando todo esto y porque
[1:49:00] usted está en desacuerdo, pero lo
[1:49:04] escucharon. Ahora ha plantado una
[1:49:06] simiente de duda en
[1:49:07] ellos, está bien hablar con
[1:49:10] ellos. ¿Sabes qué? Vamos a revisar esto
[1:49:13] para mejor
[1:49:15] entender. Pero cuando explotamos y
[1:49:18] decimos, "No creo
[1:49:23] eso." Y
[1:49:26] y nos preguntamos por los hijos, "Mi
[1:49:28] papá no lo cree, pues yo
[1:49:34] tampoco." Les quiero ayudar.
[1:49:37] Todos somos culpables de eso.
[1:49:45] No haga esas cosas.
[1:49:52] que dejar que se asiente
[1:49:56] eso. Ya debemos de
[1:49:58] haber visto esto en las edades. Estuvo
[1:50:02] bien, pero
[1:50:04] ahora no hay
[1:50:08] razón. Ninguna asechanza del enemigo
[1:50:11] venga contra nosotros.
[1:50:14] Ya debemos de
[1:50:16] haber averiguado
[1:50:18] esto porque la el libro abierto revela
[1:50:21] todas estas
[1:50:23] cosas, muestra cómo opera
[1:50:28] Satanás, pero es tiempo de atarlo en
[1:50:30] nuestras
[1:50:31] vidas y hay una manera de hacerlo.
[1:50:41] Esta es la clave aquí.
[1:50:43] El Espíritu Santo, la clave que el
[1:50:45] Espíritu Santo nos está
[1:50:47] dando, hay una manera para
[1:50:50] hacerlo. La apertura de los
[1:50:55] sellos, lo que
[1:51:00] sueltas. Vamos.
[1:51:03] ¿Qué fue sueltos? Los siete sellos.
[1:51:06] Lo que
[1:51:07] sueltas será
[1:51:09] suelto. Lo que
[1:51:11] ates será
[1:51:15] atado. Los que son espirituales lo
[1:51:17] pueden
[1:51:19] captar. La apertura de los sellos mostró
[1:51:23] muchas
[1:51:25] cosas, pero mostró quién es el
[1:51:29] anticristo y cómo
[1:51:32] opera.
[1:51:36] Am cuando entendemos estas
[1:51:42] cosas, las puertas del Hades no pueden
[1:51:44] prevalecer contra esta novia, porque
[1:51:47] sabemos el enemigo y sus aschanzas, sus
[1:51:51] engaños, sus
[1:51:55] mentiras.
[1:51:57] Okay. ¿Quién lo quiere atar en su vida?
[1:52:01] A ver quién está en
[1:52:03] serio. Yo levanto mis dos manos. Hay que
[1:52:06] atarlo.
[1:52:11] ¿Lo vamos a hacer todos juntos o
[1:52:15] no? No estoy interesado solo atarlo en
[1:52:17] mi
[1:52:18] vida. Yo quiero atarlo en mi
[1:52:20] familia, en la
[1:52:23] iglesia y también a un nivel
[1:52:26] mundial. Donde vamos, lo quiero atar. Lo
[1:52:30] que será
[1:52:36] atado. Eles ha engrandecido su
[1:52:39] boca. Tiene una gran boca. Es lo que
[1:52:44] tiene. Es tan
[1:52:48] tremendo. Ha desangradecido su grande
[1:52:50] boca. Dígale su vecino. El infierno
[1:52:53] tiene una grande boca.
[1:52:59] Cuando esty hablando alguien con
[1:53:00] alguien, no tienes una boca muy muy
[1:53:02] grande, siempre hablando.
[1:53:07] El infierno tiene gran
[1:53:10] boca. El infierno tiene una gran
[1:53:13] [Música]
[1:53:15] boca y si sabemos si tiene una
[1:53:18] boca, porque siempre estamos prestando
[1:53:20] oído a ello.
[1:53:24] Vamos a llegar algo aquí.
[1:53:31] tiene su vista en usted y en
[1:53:37] mí. Pero nuestro
[1:53:41] novio ya derrotó la muerte, el infierno
[1:53:44] y el
[1:53:47] sepulcro. No hay necesidad de tener
[1:53:51] temor. Dígale a su vecino, "No tema.
[1:53:57] que todo el cielo también se ha
[1:54:00] [Música]
[1:54:03] soltado. Las puertas delades no pueden
[1:54:05] prevalecer contra esta
[1:54:07] novia porque ella es la
[1:54:10] palabra, la palabra completa, el novio
[1:54:14] ha sido establecido en
[1:54:16] ella.
[1:54:19] Vaya. ¿Cuántos saben que Satanás será
[1:54:21] atado por 1000 años?
[1:54:25] Mire, escuche esto. Escuche
[1:54:28] esto. ¿Cuántos
[1:54:30] saben? Satanás será atado por 1000 años.
[1:54:34] Oh, gracias a
[1:54:35] Dios. No me puedo
[1:54:37] imaginar levantarme en la
[1:54:40] mañana y no hay dolores.
[1:54:46] Hoy en día tengo que hacer una una
[1:54:48] pierna a la vez.
[1:54:52] Ni siquiera puedo tocar mis dedos en los
[1:54:54] pies, pero
[1:54:57] intento. Y una hora después ya estoy un
[1:54:59] poco ya más suelto.
[1:55:03] No se ría si usted está joven. Uno de
[1:55:06] estos días se va a envejecer. Es
[1:55:09] real. No estoy así de anciano, pero es
[1:55:13] real.
[1:55:19] Pensamos estas
[1:55:23] cosas. ¿Cómo será que nadie se va a
[1:55:25] enfermar?
[1:55:28] No puedo pensar sobre eso. Nadie está
[1:55:31] enfermo, nadie está
[1:55:34] perdido, ni su esposa no lo está yendo
[1:55:38] contra usted.
[1:55:41] Muy bien. O
[1:55:43] esposo maltratándolo a
[1:55:47] [Música]
[1:55:49] usted ambos lados.
[1:55:52] Oh, no puedo esperar llegar al
[1:55:55] milenio. Vamos.
[1:55:57] Estamos viendo para esas cosas. Qué
[1:55:59] tiempo.
[1:56:03] Pero tenemos que esperar hasta el
[1:56:05] milenio para atar a
[1:56:07] [Música]
[1:56:09] Satanás. Tenemos que esperar al
[1:56:12] milenio para poder atar a Satanás en su
[1:56:16] vida. No, que Dios no lo quiera de esa
[1:56:18] manera.
[1:56:22] Hemos sido engañados en pensar así.
[1:56:36] o dice que el hermano Branham leó porque
[1:56:38] todo iba a terminar en 1977.
[1:56:45] Espérese un
[1:56:46] momento. Estamos en la tierra.
[1:56:52] Oh, esa uva estuvo
[1:56:57] está bueno.
[1:57:00] Tenemos aquí granadas y hijos, uvas y
[1:57:04] estamos en la
[1:57:05] tierra. No ha
[1:57:07] notado. En cada etapa de la
[1:57:10] jornada Dios cambió su dieta. ¿Han
[1:57:13] notado
[1:57:14] eso? En Egipto o pepinos y cebollas.
[1:57:20] lo que tenían
[1:57:23] allá. Bueno, a la segunda etapa y ¿qué
[1:57:27] es?
[1:57:29] Maná y
[1:57:32] codornices. Pero entran a la tierra
[1:57:35] prometida. Ya no hay godornices, ya no
[1:57:37] hay
[1:57:38] maná. Ahora es el fruto de la tierra, es
[1:57:42] el
[1:57:44] maíz.
[1:57:46] Vamos, a veces tienes que cambiar de la
[1:57:49] manera que
[1:57:50] come. El
[1:57:52] hermano el hermano Danny le dio la la
[1:57:55] clave de la
[1:57:58] premognatura y por dos semanas estábamos
[1:58:01] muy
[1:58:02] tremendos y luego nos caemos del
[1:58:05] tren.
[1:58:06] Llegamos al modo predeterminado como
[1:58:12] comíamos y nos preguntamos porque no
[1:58:14] llegamos a ningún
[1:58:16] lugar. Vaya de regreso escuche lo que
[1:58:19] predicó el hermano. Fue el Señor
[1:58:22] predicándonos. Tenemos que
[1:58:25] esperar para el milenio para poder
[1:58:27] atarlo en nuestras
[1:58:29] vidas. No sé a qué horas
[1:58:32] empecé, pero tenemos que terminar.
[1:58:38] Esto está tremendo. Número 3 en 64.
[1:58:43] Es el día
[1:58:47] sábado cuando la iglesia ya no va a
[1:58:49] trabajar contra el
[1:58:51] pecado. ¿Qué dijo el hermano BR de 1977?
[1:58:57] que terminaría el mundo, los sistemas
[1:59:02] mundiales y iba a entrar el
[1:59:05] milenio, introducir el
[1:59:08] milenio. ¿Dónde le
[1:59:12] erró? ¿Fallé en
[1:59:14] algo, algo fue
[1:59:17] introducido? ¿Sabes? ¿Sabes qué fue
[1:59:19] introducido?
[1:59:25] empezar a hacer las cosas que haremos en
[1:59:27] el milenio.
[1:59:31] Yo entiendo que quizás no seas
[1:59:33] entender, pero tiene que hacer lo que lo
[1:59:36] que puede hacer ahora.
[1:59:43] El día sábado cuando la iglesia ya no va
[1:59:44] a obrar contra el
[1:59:47] pecado y Satanás es atado por una
[1:59:50] pequeña temporada. 1000
[1:59:52] años. 1000 años es una temporada
[1:59:55] pequeña. Aquí viene la respuesta. ¿Por
[1:59:58] qué está atado?
[2:00:00] Sus
[2:00:01] sú todos en el infierno.
[2:00:09] Y la iglesia que está en la tierra está
[2:00:12] redimida en la presencia de
[2:00:15] Cristo. Aquí está la
[2:00:18] respuesta. Entonces, no tiene nada en lo
[2:00:20] que puede obrar.
[2:00:23] Esa es la respuesta. Esa es la
[2:00:26] clave. No tiene nada en lo que puede
[2:00:29] obrar.
[2:00:30] No es una
[2:00:32] cadena como una cadena de
[2:00:36] fierro, pero es una cadena de
[2:00:39] circunstancias. No puede hacer nada.
[2:00:42] Está sin auxilio, sin
[2:00:46] esperanza, esperando la resurrección de
[2:00:48] los
[2:00:50] súbitos. ¿Qué es esta cadena de
[2:00:52] circunstancias que lo
[2:00:56] ata? No tiene nada en lo que él puede
[2:00:58] obrar.
[2:01:02] es lo que lo hace sin auxilio, sin sin
[2:01:04] esperanza.
[2:01:06] nos está enseñando cómo
[2:01:09] atarlo. Si no puede obrar sobre
[2:01:13] nada, significa que no hay nadie que le
[2:01:16] preste
[2:01:20] oído. Satanás y sus demonios no tienen
[2:01:24] poder sobre aquellos que no le prestan
[2:01:27] oído.
[2:01:38] Es muy
[2:01:39] simple. ¿Ves a ese tipo al lado de ti?
[2:01:44] ¿Le puedo decir algo al respecto de él?
[2:01:49] O las cosas que él ha hecho, que está
[2:01:51] haciendo.
[2:01:54] ¿Cómo lo hiciste? ¿Cómo hiciste tú?
[2:01:57] ¿Cómo hiciste?
[2:02:01] ¿Qué piensas? ¿Me crees?
[2:02:08] dice que no me crees lo que le dije
[2:02:10] acerca del
[2:02:11] hermano. El problema es que me
[2:02:13] escuchaste y esa simiente va a crecer en
[2:02:16] ti y tarde que temprano vas a estar
[2:02:19] buscando esos
[2:02:20] errores y ahora va a tener cualquier
[2:02:23] influencia, no va a tener
[2:02:27] influencia. El momento que escuchaste,
[2:02:29] "¿Sabías esto?"
[2:02:31] Es el momento que usted tiene que
[2:02:35] pararlo. Y cuando hace
[2:02:38] eso, el está sin auxilio, sin
[2:02:43] esperanza. Vamos a iglesia.
[2:02:49] Esto no es solo para usted
[2:02:50] personalmente, aunque lo es, pero úselo
[2:02:53] en su
[2:02:54] familia, porque es el problema en las
[2:02:56] familias
[2:02:58] hoy. Mamá y papá irán a los hijos, a las
[2:03:02] hijas, oh, tu hermano, tu hermana.
[2:03:04] ¿Sabes lo que están haciendo ellos?
[2:03:10] Con razón no sabes nada al respecto del
[2:03:13] milenio. En el milenio él está
[2:03:17] atado, no tiene a
[2:03:19] nadie en quién trabajar, en quién
[2:03:22] obrar, porque los redimidos no le
[2:03:25] prestan oído.
[2:03:26] [Aplausos]
[2:03:31] Y todos sus súpitos están en el
[2:03:34] infierno. Esas son las circunstancias.
[2:03:39] No hay nadie en quién
[2:03:40] obrar. Estoy sin
[2:03:44] auxilio. Así hace que el enemigo esté
[2:03:46] sin auxilio en su
[2:03:47] [Aplausos]
[2:03:49] vida. Yo siempre le digo al pueblo, los
[2:03:52] padres, las
[2:03:54] madres, si tienes un problema con los
[2:03:59] hijos, eso debe ser una
[2:04:03] relación y con el otro otra relación.
[2:04:06] no esté mezclando
[2:04:08] relaciones, es lo que causa problemas en
[2:04:10] la
[2:04:11] familia, es lo que causa problemas en la
[2:04:18] iglesia. Es tiempo que atemos a a
[2:04:21] Satanás en esta iglesia. Dígale su
[2:04:23] vecino, vecino, es tiempo de
[2:04:29] atarle, pero al menos que la palabra
[2:04:31] esté establecida en usted, nunca lo
[2:04:34] hará.
[2:04:36] teniendo oídos de conezón, comezón de
[2:04:39] oír. Dime más. Oh, en serio. Oh,
[2:04:44] vaya. Oh, no lo creí. No, pero eres un
[2:04:48] basudero y ya después de un tiempo el
[2:04:50] basudero está sucio.
[2:04:54] [Música]
[2:04:57] Oh, solo estaba viendo el TikTok y el
[2:05:00] Instagram y esto salió.
[2:05:03] No est mintiendo. Usted fue buscándolo.
[2:05:12] Quizás me salí en la salida equivocada.
[2:05:15] Es la correcta. No es la
[2:05:17] correcta. Estoy aquí para decirle,
[2:05:21] iglesia, tenemos que hacerlo primero
[2:05:23] como
[2:05:24] individuos y luego como
[2:05:26] familia. Enséñele a sus a sus hijos.
[2:05:29] Cierre sus oídos.
[2:05:32] Así empieza a
[2:05:34] atarle. Es posible,
[2:05:37] iglesia, atar a Satanás
[2:05:40] ahora. No espérese hasta la edad del
[2:05:44] milenio porque se va a seguir
[2:05:46] abriendo. Usted no va a llegar al
[2:05:50] milenio. Cierre sus oídos.
[2:05:53] Lo que no es de Dios, no quiero escuchar
[2:05:56] eso.
[2:06:00] Puede decir al infierno que cierre su
[2:06:02] grande
[2:06:05] boca. Ahora me estoy sintiendo
[2:06:07] religioso.
[2:06:10] Ahora, ¿cuántos quieren que Satanás esté
[2:06:12] sin auxilio, sin esperanza en su vida?
[2:06:16] Se lo digo, pero nadie me cree.
[2:06:19] Yo vivo en paz todos los días.
[2:06:22] Yo siempre estoy en paz. Mi alma está en
[2:06:25] paz.
[2:06:28] ¿Sabe por qué?
[2:06:31] No tengo redes sociales.
[2:06:33] [Música]
[2:06:36] Oh, soy lo suficiente fuerte. Sí, claro
[2:06:39] que
[2:06:43] sí. Usted quiere hacer eso,
[2:06:47] yo no forzo a nadie en hacer nada en
[2:06:48] esta iglesia.
[2:06:51] Yo les he forzado a alguien ha
[2:06:54] esto. ¿Por qué ser un
[2:06:56] dictador? La revelación
[2:06:59] viene porque está dispuesto entrar a ese
[2:07:02] lugar secreto con él. Solo le puedo dar
[2:07:05] el patrón. Yo vivo en paz. ¿Sabes por
[2:07:09] qué? Todo el tiempo aventando al hermano
[2:07:12] Caleb. Y yo no lo tomo personal.
[2:07:15] Mi lucha no es contra sangre y carne, es
[2:07:18] contra principados y gobernadores del
[2:07:21] aire. Y sabes que no me
[2:07:25] importa. Oh, está hablando del pastor.
[2:07:27] ¿Cómo supiste?
[2:07:29] [Música]
[2:07:31] Vamos, estamos hablando, estaban
[2:07:34] hablando del ministerio. ¿Cómo supiste?
[2:07:37] Porque te quedaste ahí para escuchar lo
[2:07:39] que tuvieron que decir. Y se preguntan,
[2:07:42] ¿por qué a
[2:07:42] veces miramos algunos de los ministros?
[2:07:45] Oh, Dios, Dios te
[2:07:47] bendiga. ¿Por qué estás actuando así?
[2:07:50] Decir mi hermano
[2:07:53] si me vas a
[2:07:57] Muy
[2:07:59] bien. ¿Por qué somos así?
[2:08:03] Porque escuchamos.
[2:08:07] Nos tenemos que quedar aquí por los
[2:08:08] siguientes 20 minutos. Nos podemos
[2:08:10] quedar aquí unas
[2:08:12] horas. Hay que hacerlo sin auxilio, sin
[2:08:15] esperanza. Nuestras vidas, familias, en
[2:08:18] nuestra
[2:08:19] iglesia.
[2:08:22] Hátelo y ya no le preste oído a él.
[2:08:29] Si piensa que va a obtener puntos con el
[2:08:32] hermano C. Oh, deje le digo, hermano lo
[2:08:34] que dijeron.
[2:08:36] No, no me importa. Yo quiero saber por
[2:08:38] qué te abriste a eso.
[2:08:44] No tienen poder sobre mí.
[2:08:48] Vamos, iglesia. No deben de tener
[2:08:50] poder. Es hijo o hija de Dios debe tener
[2:08:53] cero poder
[2:08:55] sobre oídos le está dando
[2:08:58] poder. Le está dando poder para
[2:09:01] controlar si está teniendo un buen día o
[2:09:03] un mal día. Oh, tengo un mal día hoy.
[2:09:07] ¿Qué estabas escuchando?
[2:09:15] Con razón dijo a través de todas las
[2:09:18] edades, el que tiene
[2:09:21] oído, oiga
[2:09:27] lo que están diciendo en
[2:09:31] TikTok, lo que están diciendo en la
[2:09:34] iglesia.
[2:09:37] [Música]
[2:09:40] Vamos, el que tiene oído,
[2:09:43] escuche lo que el
[2:09:46] espíritu dice a la iglesia esta
[2:09:50] mañana. No tenemos
[2:09:53] excusa. Por eso Satanás odia la
[2:09:56] revelación, porque revelación activa la
[2:09:59] palabra, vivifica la
[2:10:01] palabra en orden para que sea
[2:10:05] manifestada. Amén.
[2:10:08] Estoy dando la vuelta. Les
[2:10:10] iba a predicar sobre el nuevo Papa,
[2:10:14] pero tuve que predicar esto
[2:10:18] primero. Si no tiene esto, no preocupes,
[2:10:22] no se
[2:10:22] preocupe lo que está haciendo la bestia.
[2:10:26] Preocúpese lo que está haciendo
[2:10:28] [Aplausos]
[2:10:33] Cristo. Este
[2:10:35] mensaje,
[2:10:37] escúcheme, este
[2:10:40] mensaje es el enfoque
[2:10:44] principal de cada demonio que ha salido
[2:10:46] del
[2:10:48] infierno. Por eso todo el infierno está
[2:10:50] en contra de este
[2:10:52] mensaje. Es el enfoque principal.
[2:10:57] piénselo. Si no le importa algo, no le
[2:10:59] molesta.
[2:11:02] Oh, el hermano no dijo esto sobre
[2:11:05] ti. Oh,
[2:11:08] pero yo sé que no. Él no haría eso.
[2:11:15] [Música]
[2:11:17] Ahora mire,
[2:11:20] si me enfoco en
[2:11:21] algo es porque me está molestando.
[2:11:32] Sí o sí.
[2:11:35] Siempre nos enfocamos. Oh.
[2:11:38] o la hermana y ese
[2:11:42] hermano. Como
[2:11:45] dije, la manera que actúa y vive muestra
[2:11:48] si está en las edades o no. Está
[2:11:51] pensando como alguien del
[2:11:53] odisea o el hermano, la
[2:11:56] hermana, salga de la
[2:12:00] iglesia. ¿Por qué se está quedando en la
[2:12:02] iglesia?
[2:12:03] Entonces, no estoy hablando de de eso,
[2:12:06] sino que sube acá. Es lo que estoy
[2:12:09] diciendo. Odia la
[2:12:12] revelación porque es lo que produce la
[2:12:15] revelación. Nuevo todo el el infierno
[2:12:18] está en contra este
[2:12:23] mensaje. Y este mensaje es el enfoque
[2:12:26] principal de cada demonio, cada ángel
[2:12:28] caído que ha salido del infierno.
[2:12:31] Voy a hacer una declaración aquí.
[2:12:34] Por
[2:12:36] eso están obsesionados con el hermano
[2:12:39] Branham y su
[2:12:45] mensaje y cada uno que se para con
[2:12:51] él. Cada está obsesionado sobre
[2:12:53] este mensaje. ¿Cómo lo podemos detener?
[2:12:57] ¿Qué podemos
[2:12:58] hacer? Hable mal sobre ellos. Oh.
[2:13:05] Él ya introdució el milenio.
[2:13:09] [Música]
[2:13:15] No tiene
[2:13:17] efecto. Está sin auxilio, sin
[2:13:20] esperanza. Y podemos obtener que la
[2:13:22] iglesia esté en esa
[2:13:24] condición, ya seríamos raptad, raptados
[2:13:27] fuera de aquí.
[2:13:29] y cierre ese oído a cosas que no tienen
[2:13:33] entendido. Estos diablos están
[2:13:34] obsesionados en
[2:13:36] el la apertura de esos siete sellos y la
[2:13:40] apertura de la
[2:13:44] palabra quitó ese cubierto del Satanás y
[2:13:47] sus
[2:13:48] diablos, los
[2:13:52] desenmascaró y los hace muy
[2:13:56] incómodos. ¿No me cree?
[2:13:59] 26.
[2:14:04] El Seol está descubierto delante de
[2:14:07] él y el Abadón no tiene cobertura.
[2:14:16] ¿Ha visto algo está desnudo cubierto?
[2:14:21] No creo que lo dije muy
[2:14:24] bien. Yo creo que se ha visto
[2:14:30] Pero usted sabe lo que quiero decir.
[2:14:34] Lo primero es, oh,
[2:14:37] hay una pena que hay ahí.
[2:14:42] Es lo que hizo el mensaje. Quitó la
[2:14:45] cobertura. Ahora el infierno está
[2:14:48] desnudo.
[2:14:53] Con razón odian este
[2:14:56] mensaje. Los hace sin auxilio, sin
[2:15:02] esperanza. Si fuimos a África solo
[2:15:04] edificar un
[2:15:05] edificio, Satanás no le
[2:15:09] importa. No le importa que hagamos
[2:15:11] trabajo
[2:15:13] misionero. Alimentar los pobres. A él no
[2:15:15] le
[2:15:17] importa. Está en su sillón. Sí, está
[2:15:20] bien.
[2:15:22] Como los oficiantes de inmigración,
[2:15:29] pero de repente algo sale en su
[2:15:31] pandalla. Oh,
[2:15:34] espérese. No, no le importa si le da
[2:15:37] ropa que necesita, no es importa.
[2:15:41] Pero cuando la palabra comienza a
[2:15:44] establecerse, es lo que lo saca de la
[2:15:48] cama. Mire lo que
[2:15:50] aconteció. Lo estoy diciendo. Todo el
[2:15:53] infierno está en
[2:15:54] contra. Hermano Tomás mostró
[2:15:57] esto y mucha gente no lo
[2:16:01] vio. Después que nos fuimos.
[2:16:06] Después que nos fuimos de
[2:16:07] Uganda, mantengan eso allá.
[2:16:12] Por primera vez,
[2:16:18] por primera
[2:16:21] vez, todos los líderes
[2:16:26] religiosos vinieron juntos.
[2:16:32] Nunca en la historia de Uganda ha
[2:16:34] acontecido esto.
[2:16:36] ¿Cuántos recuerdan la visión que Dios le
[2:16:38] dio a Diego?
[2:16:41] La visión fue que este caballo, este
[2:16:43] poder estaba encima del árbol y fue
[2:16:46] derribado. Nosotros estamos allá
[2:16:50] predicando, quizás no completamente
[2:16:53] conscientes de lo que pasando, pero
[2:16:56] sobrenaturalmente esos poderes fueron
[2:16:59] derribados y y lo
[2:17:04] sintieron. Yo no me invento estas cosas.
[2:17:12] Pentecostales, católicos, protestantes
[2:17:15] tuvieron una
[2:17:18] reunión y el líder de la denominación
[2:17:22] pentecostal, ¿cuántos recuerdan?
[2:17:26] fue la iglesia
[2:17:29] pentecostal que puso que quisieron
[2:17:33] deshacerse del hermano
[2:17:36] Roger. Pagaron 500 para que alguien lo
[2:17:40] matara, lo asesinara.
[2:17:45] Y
[2:17:46] ahora tienen esta
[2:17:49] reunión, este
[2:17:50] líder denominación
[2:17:54] de estaba en el parlamento hablando
[2:17:57] contra el
[2:17:59] mensaje o nos
[2:18:06] odia. No solo al hermano Caleb y el
[2:18:08] ministerio, no nos odian a todos.
[2:18:12] Porque ahora sienten el
[2:18:16] impacto de este mensaje en el
[2:18:19] [Aplausos]
[2:18:25] país, fuerzas viniendo en contra de la
[2:18:29] novia y el hermano que nos envió este,
[2:18:32] oren por
[2:18:35] nosotros, que brillamos más luz.
[2:18:41] para predicar este mensaje aún más. Me
[2:18:43] gusta
[2:18:45] eso. Este pastor que mandó
[2:18:48] esto, él no tiene temor tampoco, pero
[2:18:51] ore por nosotros, que podamos dar
[2:18:54] nuestras vidas y seguir predicando el
[2:18:59] evangelio. Ya sé que quita nuestra vida,
[2:19:02] eso no
[2:19:03] importa. Lo hemos dicho muchas
[2:19:06] veces en el avivamiento 1906. Aquella
[2:19:10] Susa, mandaron misionero tras misionero
[2:19:13] a África y
[2:19:17] morían y ellos no empezaban a llorar.
[2:19:20] ¿Sabes qué qué hacían? Manden
[2:19:22] más. Ellos morían. Manden
[2:19:25] más hasta que el evangelio
[2:19:27] llegue a cada corazón donde debe
[2:19:32] llegar. El segundo retrato. Mire,
[2:19:37] tienen esta reunión.
[2:19:40] sobre
[2:19:41] nosotros. Dígale a su vecino de
[2:19:44] nosotros. Mire lo que están
[2:19:47] diciendo. Tienen problemas contra las
[2:19:50] iglesias del mensaje del tiempo del
[2:19:53] fin y nos llaman a
[2:19:56] nosotros rebeldes de del
[2:20:00] gobierno. ¿Cómo se siente?
[2:20:09] dice que estamos en en la cruciada del
[2:20:11] infierno, ¿no?
[2:20:14] Sino que el infierno está en la cruciada
[2:20:16] de
[2:20:18] nosotros. Vamos, no vamos a
[2:20:22] parar. Tenemos propósito en este mundo.
[2:20:26] Tenemos propósito en la vida. Dios nos
[2:20:28] llamó, nos
[2:20:30] eligió para hacer lo que estamos
[2:20:33] haciendo, terminar la visión.
[2:20:36] Es lo que tenemos que hacer, iglesia,
[2:20:38] terminar la
[2:20:40] visión. No importa lo que nos
[2:20:42] cueste, él sabe todas las
[2:20:45] cosas. Si este mensaje no era
[2:20:48] verdad, no habría nadie hablando sobre
[2:20:52] él. Pero ahora tenemos gobiernos
[2:20:54] hablando de
[2:20:57] él. El hermano Branham lo
[2:21:00] dijo. Unos de estos días van a cerrar
[2:21:02] esta iglesia.
[2:21:05] ¿Qué va a pensar? Yo creo que estábamos
[2:21:08] mal porque cerraron la iglesia.
[2:21:12] Van a usar estas iglesias como
[2:21:17] bodegas. Un de estos días van a
[2:21:21] marcar el pasaporte para que ya no
[2:21:23] entremos al
[2:21:25] país. Pero en cuanto esa esa simiente se
[2:21:29] germen esa palabra hablada que es la
[2:21:32] simiente original.
[2:21:34] encontrado su lugar en el corazón del
[2:21:38] pueblo. Entonces, hemos hecho nuestro
[2:21:40] trabajo y nos
[2:21:43] aseguramos, Dios se va a asegurar que la
[2:21:46] simienta encuentra su lugar y que
[2:21:48] crezca. Es lo que tenemos que
[2:21:51] hacer. No fuimos a tener un buen
[2:21:54] tiempo. El Señor mostró por qué
[2:21:56] estuvimos
[2:21:58] ahí. Fuimos por esa parte de la novia
[2:22:01] que está en Uganda.
[2:22:04] Vamos a vamos a tener temor que viene en
[2:22:07] contra de
[2:22:09] nosotros. No vaya, siga hacia
[2:22:13] adelante. Me da 5
[2:22:16] minutos. Ahora 28 minutos.
[2:22:21] Vamos a tener que hacer algo, algunas de
[2:22:23] estas cosas a un lado.
[2:22:26] Se me fue dicho algo el otro día.
[2:22:30] No, no importa quién
[2:22:33] fue, pero por primera vez en mi
[2:22:36] ministerio, primera vez se me fue
[2:22:39] dicho, pare de
[2:22:41] predicar, para de predicar lo que estás
[2:22:45] predicando. Estás engañando y estás
[2:22:47] matando al pueblo.
[2:22:53] Fue el cumplido más grande que he
[2:22:55] recibido en mi
[2:22:56] [Aplausos]
[2:23:01] ministerio. Fue el cumplido más grande
[2:23:04] que he recibido. Oh, sí.
[2:23:08] Gracias, Señor, por eso. Qué
[2:23:12] cumplido. Estás muy
[2:23:15] tarde. Yo prediqué este
[2:23:17] mensaje cuando yo tenía un dólar en mi
[2:23:22] bolsillo. Lo prediqué cuando no tenía
[2:23:24] nada de alimentar mi
[2:23:26] familia, cuando mi mamá estaba muriendo
[2:23:29] y
[2:23:33] falleció. Prediqué porque la palabra fue
[2:23:35] establecida en mi corazón.
[2:23:37] por padres
[2:23:40] piadosos y por el mensaje traído por un
[2:23:43] profeta
[2:23:46] vindicado. Fue a través de ellos que
[2:23:48] entendí quién fue Cristo, quién es y
[2:23:51] quién
[2:23:53] fue. No predico porque estoy tratando de
[2:23:55] ser salvo. Yo ya he sido salvo. Yo ya he
[2:23:59] sido elegido.
[2:24:03] predico para establecer lo
[2:24:05] mismo en los corazones del pueblo a
[2:24:08] donde Dios nos
[2:24:09] envía. Este es tiempo de
[2:24:14] manifestación, es tiempo que prueba lo
[2:24:16] que ha sido establecido en
[2:24:19] nosotros, que cada simiente va a traer
[2:24:23] conforme a su
[2:24:27] género. Los músicos pueden pasar.
[2:24:29] Termino con
[2:24:31] esto. Sube
[2:24:33] acá. Es lo que nos está
[2:24:37] pidiendo. No se preocupe lo que está
[2:24:42] aconteciendo. Si puede tomar esta
[2:24:44] palabra, no no se preocupe lo que está,
[2:24:46] no se enfoque lo que está aconteciendo
[2:24:47] alrededor. No preste oído, simplemente
[2:24:50] este, crea, sube
[2:24:54] acá y hagas su
[2:24:57] su reclama.
[2:25:02] Eso fue el
[2:25:03] llamamiento. Sube
[2:25:05] acá. ¿Cuántos han subido más
[2:25:11] alto? Mire todos los
[2:25:16] tipos. Estoy regresando de
[2:25:20] Uganda. Iba en camino a Noruega.
[2:25:24] ¿Y dónde estoy?
[2:25:26] Estoy volando en los cielos.
[2:25:29] Estoy en un avión, no estoy en en en la
[2:25:32] tierra, estoy más alto.
[2:25:36] Sub
[2:25:39] acá y puse mis audífonos,
[2:25:44] cerré mis
[2:25:48] ojos, Dios es mi salvación. Escuchando
[2:25:51] este himno, Dios es mi salvación. Mi
[2:25:53] salvación.
[2:25:56] Lo puede tocar, hermano.
[2:26:00] Ho, escuchando, hermano Tomás cantando
[2:26:04] este himno. Dios es es mi
[2:26:08] salvación. Y en un
[2:26:12] momento nunca me ha acontecido de esta
[2:26:14] manera.
[2:26:15] No me
[2:26:17] dormí, estaba despier despierto, estaba
[2:26:23] contigo, de repente algo me sacó de mi
[2:26:26] propio ser, me sacó y me puso en este
[2:26:29] cuarto. Estoy parado en este
[2:26:33] cuarto y y noto mucha gente, diferentes
[2:26:37] mesas.
[2:26:38] No puedo ver el rostro
[2:26:41] de todos estaban así si estaban viendo
[2:26:44] algo, comiendo, no
[2:26:45] sé. Solo sé que era un cuarto lleno de
[2:26:48] personas.
[2:26:52] Y cuando llegué a cierta
[2:26:54] mesa, había dos personas en la
[2:26:58] mesa. Mi enfoque estaba en esta
[2:27:02] persona. No miré hacia para ver quién
[2:27:06] era. No era la razón que yo estaba.
[2:27:09] Yo miré a esta
[2:27:11] persona y miré a esta
[2:27:15] persona y por encima de la
[2:27:18] cabeza yo
[2:27:20] dije, "Ella se mira tan
[2:27:23] familiar." Y en ese
[2:27:25] tiempo dio su
[2:27:28] vuelta, me
[2:27:30] mira y me da una sonrisa.
[2:27:33] ¿Quién es mi mamá?
[2:27:39] Lo que es tremendo es esto.
[2:27:41] [Música]
[2:27:46] En los tiempos que ellas ya no ha estado
[2:27:48] con nosotros, he tenido
[2:27:51] sueños. Cada vez que yo la
[2:27:56] veía, la gente me preguntaba, "¿Está
[2:27:58] joven? ¿Cómo se mira?"
[2:28:04] y siempre decía, parece que tiene 30
[2:28:07] años de edad, más o
[2:28:10] menos, no era tan edad cuando se fue,
[2:28:13] pero tampoco era
[2:28:15] joven, siempre tenía como 30, 35 años de
[2:28:18] edad, pero esta vez
[2:28:21] ella estaba joven,
[2:28:24] estaba muy
[2:28:25] joven, estaba joven,
[2:28:29] tenía 18 o 20 años.
[2:28:32] me miró a
[2:28:33] mí cuando está en esa espera. Ella no
[2:28:36] tiene que
[2:28:38] hablar. Yo podía escuchar lo que estaba
[2:28:40] pensando. Me miró y fueron sus
[2:28:44] pensamientos. Sigue haciendo lo que
[2:28:46] estás
[2:28:47] haciendo. No necesito nada
[2:28:49] más. Fue el Señor diciendo, "Sigue,
[2:28:53] hijo. Sigue haciendo lo que estás
[2:28:56] haciendo. Sigue presionando la batalla.
[2:29:00] Si supieras lo que les espera, iglesia,
[2:29:04] les digo esta mañana, mientras se ponen
[2:29:05] de pie, presionen la batalla esta
[2:29:08] mañana. No tenga vergüenza, no tenga
[2:29:12] temor, no tenga
[2:29:14] temor. He aquí soy yo. No
[2:29:18] temáis. Presione esta mañana. Presione
[2:29:21] la batalla. Todo el infierno está en
[2:29:23] contra nosotros. ¿Y qué?
[2:29:26] Nosotros estamos contra todo el
[2:29:28] infierno mientras inclina su rostro.
[2:29:31] Señor Jesús, gracias, Señor. Gracias por
[2:29:34] tu
[2:29:35] palabra. Gracias por
[2:29:37] darnos palabras de
[2:29:39] vida. Gracias por hablarnos.
[2:29:43] Gracias por las claves que nos diste
[2:29:45] hoy, oh cerrar nuestros oídos y a
[2:29:48] escuchar solo a ti,
[2:29:51] Señor. Que las vidas sean cambiadas, que
[2:29:54] las familias sean cambiadas, que la
[2:29:56] iglesia sea cambiada, que todos nosotros
[2:29:59] seamos cambiados para estar
[2:30:02] preparados para cuando nos llames.

[2:30:06] aquí.

[2:30:09] línea, los que escucharán este
[2:30:12] mensaje, que levante,
[2:30:15] Señor, que cause que esa llama crezca
[2:30:18] ese fuego dentro de ellos.
[2:30:22] Señor, danos lo que
[2:30:23] necesitamos ya sido
[2:30:25] dado, pero que lo obtengamos, que
[2:30:28] corramos con él, que corramos con
[2:30:31] él, traerlo a este mundo
[2:30:34] moribundo. Los que están luchando por lo
[2:30:37] que están batallando, oro por ellos.
[2:30:41] Somos humanos y estamos en esta tierra,
[2:30:44] Señor. Hay cosas que duelen, Señor. Pero
[2:30:48] yo oro que en el nombre de Jesucristo,
[2:30:50] que tu Espíritu Santo, vaya en este
[2:30:52] edificio. Cada mano que ha sido
[2:30:54] levantada, cada corazón que está
[2:30:56] sangrando, que está
[2:30:58] clamando, yo pido tú eres el gran
[2:31:01] consolador, que los que les des consuelo
[2:31:03] este día. Cuando todo esté hecho, te
[2:31:06] daremos la honra y la gloria porque todo
[2:31:08] te pertenece.
[2:31:10] Dios les bendiga. Les amamos. Presionen
[2:31:13] la
