years ago he couldn't write one word of English he hardly knew it you take your laundry to him you know what did he do he had little pieces of paper nothing wrote on it at all he just tear that piece of paper and gave give you one piece when you come back that piece of paper had to match his piece of paper or you didn't get your arm read that's a whole lot better you can copy a name but you ain't going to fool him there cuz that piece of paper has to match exactly with his piece of paper that's the way God made his Covenant too our experience is not to match some Creed some Dogma some church denomination but it's the match God's word Jesus Christ [Music] [Applause] right you're very busy day today got lots of laundry to do have you ever worked in laundry before for no well you going to learn today boy let's keep going up here why you wearing your shoes why you wearing your shoes you take your shoe off you take them off what ow hurt my ears who messed up my store who knocked this

$5 oh hello how are you doing today my name is Mr Chow you have to hold the microphone today cuz we're going to bust everybody's ears out okay there you go my name is Mr Chow and I come from China welcome to the year 1849 can anybody tell me what happened in 1849 anybody so in California there was what was called the gold rush and everybody came from all around to see if they could strike a fortune and get gold in California so I came down looking for Fortune but all I found was a broken leg and a hospital bed yeah it didn't work work out for me after the first winter I find out I'm not cut out for California especially in the harsh winter but while all the men go out looking for gold I go back to City and I find out nobody has a wandy man so I opened a Wy store wo it's called golden ticket wandry so Sam Sam son prices are $5 for shirt $7 for pant $7 for Co $7.77 for dress and if you have a stain 77 cents so here's how it works Sammy come here pay close attention so we are going

everyone's going to get laundry come over here okay fine we got to tell them the reason we do that so I want you all to listen very close okay so when we tear the ticket there's no way to fake it if you try to bring me another ticket that does not match then it won't work and that's the way God's word is when we do things that we shouldn't be doing and we try to match it up with God's word it not fit so if I cut this piece there you see it not fit but not only does that happen but the devil too tries to he tries to tell you something and when God's word's in your heart it doesn't match up but when God's word is in your heart and this is you this is God's word and it come together it fits so perfect and there's no room for the devil to get in and that is why it's so so important to make sure that you always get what belongs to you the only way you can do it is when the word is in your heart when God's word is in your heart you can go and purchase whatever belongs to you and the devil cannot keep keep it away from you amen amen who wants to tear a ticket I have a couple tickets come come we do have a couple tickets give him a ticket Sam here you go golden ticket there you go one
