[23:21] such as was not from the beginning of
[23:23] the creation which God created un this
[23:26] time neither shall
[23:35] [Music]
[23:42] be and except that the Lord had CH those
[23:47] days no flesh should be saved but for

[24:32] and God en reached
[24:35] you brother Bram said I preached once to
[24:40] two 2 or 3:00 in the
[24:44] morning people were walking down the
[24:46] aisle just praising
[24:51] God a dozen or so receive the holy ghost
[24:54] at 3:00 in the
[24:57] morning
[24:59] and brother brandham said God have
[25:03] mercy I wish I could see that
[25:06] again but we
[25:08] can't that day is
[25:11] gone she is far
[25:14] spent the night is
[25:18] here all we used to have all night
[25:20] prayer
[25:23] meetings preaching in the
[25:26] Parks Revival fires
[25:30] so why are the days going to be
[25:33] shorten a man came to my house
[25:37] once and said brother Brenham I want to
[25:41] get rid of my
[25:44] sins and be a
[25:46] Christian so I went to Billy Graham's
[25:50] meeting bil and he said hold up your
[25:53] right
[25:55] hand and accept Christ
[25:59] as your personal
[26:02] savior it didn't do me any
[26:05] good then I went to Oral Roberts
[26:08] meeting Roberts he told me you stay in
[26:11] that inquiry
[26:14] room and stay there until you're so
[26:20] happy you speak with
[26:22] Tong I did but it didn't do me any good
[26:27] then I went to another
[26:29] meeting they told me that I had to get
[26:35] Sanctified get happy and
[26:39] Shout yet enough
[26:42] Joy I prayed and I
[26:45] prayed till I
[26:48] shouted but yet it did not do me any
[26:54] good so I went so then he he went to
[26:57] Brother Brenham
[26:59] brother Brenham said
[27:02] brother all those things are
[27:06] good I believe in those
[27:08] things but yet that is not the
[27:12] thing it is accepting the person of
[27:15] Christ
[27:17] Jesus shouting speaking in tongues
[27:22] running
[27:24] crying what where are those attributes
[27:27] that
[27:29] follow I've seen people cry crocodile
[27:37] tears
[27:40] crocod they're just
[27:42] goats but they CED like a
[27:47] sheep
[27:50] shout Sinners
[27:53] shout speaking in
[27:55] tongues Sinners speak in Tong
[27:59] and the man says then you don't believe
[28:01] in tongues brother
[28:04] brenon he said how can you say
[28:07] that the tongue is part of my
[28:10] body sure I believe in
[28:13] tongues a tree is known by the fruited
[28:18] Bears I'll give you my evidence of what
[28:22] a Christian should
[28:26] be it's true veiling of
[28:35] Soul a person who is always hungering
[28:38] and thirsting for
[28:41] God they got to have something of God
[28:44] inside of
[28:46] them so they can travail all the
[28:51] time The Book of
[28:54] Psalms
[28:57] 126
[28:59] verse five and
[29:01] six they that sow in tears shall rap in
[29:18] Joy he that goeth forth and
[29:21] whth bearing precious seed shall
[29:24] doubtless come again with rejoicing
[29:26] bringing in the Sheep shs with
[29:42] him you hunger for
[29:46] God if you hunger for
[29:49] God that
[29:51] crying the
[29:53] shouting the
[29:55] praising speaking in tongues will take
[29:58] its
[30:00] place if I would tell you
[30:03] people and you don't have to do it if I
[30:07] would tell you
[30:09] people how many of you have the Holy
[30:12] Ghost well the majority of you would
[30:15] raise your
[30:17] hand then if I would read give me
[30:20] Ezekiel
[30:25] 93 and the glory of the of God of Israel
[30:30] was gone up from the Cherub where upon
[30:33] he was to the threshold of the house and
[30:36] he called to the man clothed with linen
[30:39] which had the riders in Horn by his
[30:56] side
[31:01] and the Lord said unto him go through
[31:03] the midst of the city through the midst
[31:05] of Jerusalem and set a mark upon the
[31:08] foreheads of the men that sigh and that
[31:11] cry for all the Abominations that are
[31:13] done in the midst
[31:26] thereof
[31:32] now if I would ask
[31:35] again how many of you have the Holy
[31:37] Ghost after reading that
[31:41] scripture so if the sealing Angel would
[31:44] come to Las
[31:46] crues whom would he
[31:51] seal the doors are
[31:55] closing people do not have that burden
[32:00] anymore that's why the Bible
[32:03] says he that is filthy let him be
[32:07] filthy but he that is righteous let him
[32:10] be
[32:11] righteous and he that is Holy let him be
[32:18] holy that day we know that the door to
[32:23] the Gentiles is
[32:26] closing the day
[32:28] the time the season is just about
[32:33] over you don't find that burden
[32:38] anymore the spirit of God is being
[32:44] withdraw the love of many has wxed
[32:48] cold their
[32:51] worship has become just a
[32:54] form when the music is playing real life
[33:00] many of they're worshiping
[33:03] God but as soon as the Music Stops they
[33:09] stop and brother bam said
[33:11] this I'm not talking to you
[33:14] people I'm not talking to Bram
[33:18] Tabernacle I'm talking to all the
[33:20] churches I've G I'm going through the
[33:22] United
[33:25] States so he's not talking to you
[33:28] people see cuz he went to almost every
[33:34] state amen the burden for for people
[33:38] that are
[33:42] lost the Song of Solomon Chapter
[33:50] 2 I am the rose of Sharon and the lily
[33:55] of the
[33:56] valleys
[34:11] in order for
[34:14] you and I to understand this
[34:18] message and be a candidate for the
[34:24] supernatural we must be bold enough to
[34:27] to enter into the holy of
[34:33] holies Hebrews
[34:37] 10 10 19 and
[34:43] 20 having therefore Brethren boldness to
[34:47] enter into the holiest by the blood of
[34:56] Jesus by a New and Living Way which he
[34:59] has consecrated to for us through the
[35:02] veil that is to say his
[35:13] flesh
[35:15] Aaron had to go Beyond the
[35:18] Veil once a year and he had to be
[35:23] Anointed with a rose of
[35:26] shering
[35:28] The Rose had to be
[35:32] crushed to produce of that
[35:37] perfume and at
[35:39] Calvary Jesus was
[35:43] crushed to squeeze the perfume out of
[35:48] him because he was wounded for your
[35:54] transgression we could never approach
[35:57] God
[35:59] why couldn't we approach
[36:02] God because we were all
[36:06] stinky we had bad old
[36:09] ERS we were full of sin and we stunk
[36:14] with the habits of and sins that when we
[36:17] were out in the
[36:20] world so he took your
[36:24] stink took my stink
[36:28] when he became a
[36:31] man to take the stink out of
[36:34] him and that's why he was crushed at
[36:38] calary to give you that perfume of the
[36:42] rose of
[36:44] Cher so you could go into the presence
[36:47] of
[36:49] God
[36:51] Amen there was not the only
[36:56] attribute
[37:01] notice we were Anointed with the rose of
[37:05] Sharon Psalms
[37:09] 133 verse
[37:12] one behold how good and how pleasant it
[37:16] is for Brethren to dwell together in
[37:26] unity
[37:55] it is like the precious ointment upon
[37:57] the the head that read down upon the
[38:00] beard even Aaron's beard that went down
[38:04] to the skirts of His
[38:12] Garment as the Dew of Herman and is the
[38:15] DW that descendeth upon the mountains of
[38:17] Zion for there the Lord commandeth a
[38:20] blessing even life forever
[38:26] more
[38:32] why does he talk about the DU of
[38:37] Herman why was that D like the rose of
[38:43] Sharon because in the slopes of Mount
[38:50] Herman that's where the Jesus the Mount
[38:55] of transfiguration
[38:58] that that happened that was the Mount of
[39:01] transfiguration and the slopes of Mount
[39:07] Herman so you can imagine why the the
[39:11] the perfume that was
[39:14] there but notice when we what we read in
[39:18] Song of
[39:21] Solomon he was not only the rose of
[39:25] Sher he also was the lily of the
[39:30] valley not only a perfume from the
[39:34] rose but what does a liily
[39:38] produce oh it produce
[39:42] opium op
[39:45] op can you
[39:47] imagine oh some of these Dr attics knew
[39:50] about it they'll probably look for lies
[39:52] all over the
[39:55] place what does all op
[40:00] do it eases the
[40:04] pain that's what doctors give a
[40:09] patient in the
[40:12] natural he gives them
[40:15] opium to ease the
[40:18] pain but in the
[40:21] spiritual and you have a
[40:23] pain you have a pain for a loved one
[40:29] you have a pain to get rid of your
[40:32] habits you have a pain to get a things
[40:35] from the
[40:36] world let me this morning give you a
[40:39] shot of
[40:42] opium amen that's what the lily of the
[40:46] valley
[40:47] does amen amen that's but there's was
[40:52] another kind of
[40:54] liily there was a lily of the pond
[41:02] brother bam in
[41:06] 1933 in a mighty
[41:09] Pond he says I dedicated this
[41:14] ground to Jesus Christ it was all
[41:22] P nothing but lies grew
[41:26] there and I dedicated to the
[41:30] Lord and you know that the Lily is born
[41:33] in
[41:35] mud and he has to pass through all the
[41:40] mud to get to the
[41:43] top to show its
[41:46] beauty and then it reflects the lily of
[41:50] the
[41:51] valley and there in that ground that he
[41:56] dedicated
[41:58] they built Bram
[42:01] Tabernacle ah but there's another
[42:04] Lily notice St Matthew chapter
[42:11] 628 and why take you thought for rainmen
[42:16] consider the lies of the
[42:25] field how they
[42:27] grow they toil
[42:32] not neither do they
[42:36] spin the L of the
[42:39] valley was Jesus
[42:42] Christ and the lily of the
[42:46] valley produced The Lily of the
[42:52] pond because Brandon Tabernacle was
[42:56] built in by on that
[43:01] pond and from the lily of the
[43:05] pond that's where the message came
[43:09] from and when the message came out from
[43:12] the L of the
[43:15] pond It produced The Lily of the field
[43:19] which is
[43:23] you amen that's where Isaac MRE Rebeca
[43:27] in the
[43:31] field so why are the days
[43:36] shortening and the word will be cut
[43:41] short Genesis
[43:44] 3 verse
[43:48] 23 therefore the Lord God sent him forth
[43:52] from the Garden of Eden to teal the
[43:55] ground from when he was taken
[44:06] so he drove out the man and he placed at
[44:09] the east of the Garden of Eden
[44:17] cherubims and a flaming sword which
[44:19] turned every way to keep the we of the
[44:22] Tree of
[44:26] Life
[44:29] so he placed
[44:33] cherubim and I already I already taught
[44:36] you of those cherubin the living
[44:41] creatures two
[44:43] guard not the tree to guard the
[44:49] way Jesus said I am the
[44:52] way to guard the
[44:55] way so there was more more than one
[44:58] cherubim but notice that was not the
[45:03] only thing that
[45:06] guarded in the middle of the
[45:10] cherubim there was a
[45:12] sword and notice I asked the
[45:16] question which of that of those
[45:19] cherubims held the
[45:23] sword none of them the sword was by
[45:28] but
[45:29] notice that that
[45:32] sword that sword was taken out of the
[45:44] ship it was
[45:49] unshield the
[45:51] sword no there was that
[45:55] sword when a sword is taken out of the
[45:59] sheath or the
[46:02] quiver it means
[46:06] judgment judgment had taken place in the
[46:09] Garden of
[46:12] Eden
[46:15] notice let's go a little
[46:19] further the door was
[46:22] closed to the tree of the way to the
[46:24] Tree of
[46:25] Life and to open a closed
[46:30] door you need a
[46:33] key and Adam had lost the key to
[46:39] Satan remember when Jesus on the
[46:44] cross even brother
[46:47] said even when he was dead he was still
[46:52] working because his Spirit went to
[46:55] God but his soul went to to the the
[47:02] prison where Satan was and he took the
[47:06] keys away from
[47:09] him Satan had the
[47:11] keys but notice here I don't want to get
[47:15] ahead of my you
[47:16] know to open a closed door you need a
[47:23] key that's why the they had the chuban
[47:27] were
[47:28] there guarding that
[47:30] place let's go to Revelation
[47:35] 3:7 now it's going to get
[47:37] good not because I'm
[47:41] ministering I saw KB last time that he
[47:47] ministered I
[47:53] told I mean you're like a lion trying to
[47:56] bring out the
[47:59] message and you want to bring it just
[48:02] like God gave it to
[48:04] you oh if you know why I had a shot of
[48:10] opium this
[48:12] morning that's why I mean it it it makes
[48:15] me feel
[48:17] young cuz I got that opium inside of
[48:20] me it makes me do
[48:23] things that guys that take different
[48:26] drug
[48:28] drug and I don't know cuz I never took
[48:32] drugs oh
[48:36] they and I feel so
[48:41] good take a this I would hear them I
[48:45] never did but I would hear them
[48:47] you but you
[48:49] know I got a
[48:52] different drug in
[48:55] me I saw
[48:57] Fel this morning leading
[49:04] song and there he was dancing
[49:09] here brother Fel because he took a good
[49:11] hit
[49:13] also that's why we're twins you and I
[49:15] brother Fel amen I like to see a brother
[49:19] and sister like
[49:22] that so then notice and the angel of the
[49:26] the church in Philadelphia write these
[49:33] things he that is
[49:35] Holy he that is true he that has the Key
[49:40] of
[49:41] David he that
[49:43] open and no man shth and shth and no man
[49:49] open I not hit David this morning maybe
[49:52] next
[49:54] time I Know Thy works
[49:57] behold I have said before thee an open
[50:01] door and no man can shut
[50:05] it for thou Hast a little
[50:08] strength and kept my
[50:10] word and has not denied my
[50:13] name the Key of
[50:17] David you need to open the closed
[50:21] door what is the Key of
[50:25] David Isaiah
[50:30] 2222 and the key of the House of David
[50:34] will I lay upon his shoulder so he shall
[50:38] open and None Shall shut and he shall
[50:41] shut and None Shall
[50:52] open notice I will lay it upon his
[50:59] shoulder so where did he put it Isaiah
[51:07] 96 For unto us a child is
[51:13] born unto us a son is
[51:16] given and the government shall be upon
[51:20] his
[51:22] shoulder and his name Shall be Called
[51:25] wonderful
[51:29] counselor the Mighty God the Everlasting
[51:34] father the Prince of
[51:37] Peace that's where the Key of David was
[51:42] put the that the government was upon his
[51:47] shoulder so notice every
[51:51] church every
[51:53] denomination they claim to have the
[51:57] key oh they got the Methodist
[52:02] key they have the Pentecostal
[52:05] key every every church has the
[52:09] key but what do they open with that key
[52:14] they cannot open what was shut in the
[52:17] Garden of
[52:20] Eden their sword was
[52:23] there and none of the cherubim had the
[52:26] sword
[52:28] so who have the
[52:31] sword
[52:34] notice the notice the key is the key the
[52:41] message of the
[52:42] hour no the key is the message of the
[52:48] hour and what holds the
[52:53] key you can only know God God by
[52:59] faith which faith is
[53:02] revelation so Faith holds the
[53:07] key and what does the key
[53:11] need to turn the key he needs a
[53:16] hand he needs a hand to get a hold of
[53:20] the
[53:22] key the key is there but it needs a
[53:26] strong hand of
[53:29] Faith to turn the
[53:33] king
[53:34] amen
[53:36] hallelujah
[53:38] amen St Matthew
[53:43] 22:41 we're going into deep
[53:49] territory you need to keep up with a
[53:55] revelation I can cannot give Revelation
[53:57] to no
[53:58] one you
[54:04] know that is the word of
[54:07] God you either
[54:10] believe or you die in your
[54:15] sins
[54:17] notice St Matthew
[54:20] 22 41 while the Pharisees were gathered
[54:24] together Jesus asked
[54:30] saying what think you of
[54:33] Christ whose son is
[54:35] he they say unto him the son of
[54:38] David who had the where was the Key of
[54:42] David he says unto them how then does
[54:47] David in spirit call him
[54:53] Lord the Lord said unto my Lord sit thou
[54:57] on my right hand till I make thine
[55:00] enemies thy foot
[55:11] stool David call him Lord how is he his
[55:17] son and no man was able to answer him a
[55:22] word neither does any man from that day
[55:25] forth ask him any more
[55:31] question so it was
[55:34] someone that had the
[55:37] authority
[55:40] notice the Lord said unto my Lord oh I
[55:46] wish I could get to where I want to
[55:49] get uh it would shake you on your
[55:52] boot but we'll see how far the Lord
[55:55] takes us this is
[55:58] good like I said not because I'm
[56:00] bringing
[56:01] it I know no man after the
[56:05] flesh it is the word of God and I'm
[56:08] giving you
[56:10] scriptures to back
[56:13] up the word of God notice Revelation
[56:18] 1 1
[56:22] 10 I was on the spirit and the Lord
[56:26] day and heard behind me a great voice as
[56:30] of a
[56:39] trumpet I was in the spirit on the
[56:43] Lord's
[56:45] day the Lord said unto my
[56:48] Lord so who who's which Lord is he
[56:51] speaking here in Revelation
[56:55] one
[56:56] I told you you're going to have to keep
[56:57] up with a
[57:00] revelation how many lords are
[57:05] there verse
[57:09] 12 and I turned to see the voice that SP
[57:12] with me and being turned I saw seven
[57:15] golden
[57:25] candlesticks and in the midst of the
[57:27] seven candlesticks one like unto the son
[57:30] of
[57:32] man closed with a garment down to the
[57:41] foot and G above the peps with a golden
[57:48] girdle he was clothed with a
[57:53] garment who clothed him
[57:58] who gave him the
[58:00] Garment they were naked in the Garden of
[58:05] Eden so they they in order to cover
[58:09] their
[58:12] nakedness they s fig
[58:16] lipes that's why it says learn a par of
[58:20] the Fig
[58:24] Tree because is was
[58:28] naked when they were in the other
[58:32] countries Israel could never be
[58:36] clothed until they came to the
[58:40] Homeland cuz why did they return
[58:44] back they returned because they say we
[58:46] want to see the
[58:50] Messiah you cannot go to the presence of
[58:54] God until you
[58:57] clothed how are you
[58:59] clothed with the same
[59:05] garment you got to be clothed with that
[59:09] garment that's so Israel was
[59:12] naked and they had to be
[59:15] clothed and there was
[59:19] zakus Z was just a little
[59:22] guy and he wanted to see the message
[59:28] and how could he see him because when
[59:31] you are
[59:33] grounded you only see physical
[59:37] things if you want to see the Lord you
[59:40] got to go
[59:42] higher to Heavenly
[59:45] places so
[59:47] zus he went up the
[59:50] tree because he was high up
[59:53] there zus was still under the
[59:56] law you know what he did he did what his
[1:00:00] fathers
[1:00:01] did he hid behind the
[1:00:06] Fig he went up a
[1:00:13] tree the tree is a fig
[1:00:18] tree that's where Z was
[1:00:22] hiding the Lord said get take C your
[1:00:26] fake
[1:00:27] Lea and come here and I will clothe
[1:00:32] you
[1:00:33] amen
[1:00:35] amen so the first
[1:00:39] Adam was
[1:00:41] naked but what about the second
[1:00:46] Adam St Matthew
[1:00:50] 26
[1:00:54] 61
[1:01:22] H and as they did it he said ver you
[1:01:27] know what I think didn't did I I wanted
[1:01:30] um 61 yeah okay verely I say unto you
[1:01:34] that one of you shall betray
[1:01:39] me no it
[1:01:41] was I it was Matthew
[1:01:48] 26 okay that's fine I'm sorry I gave you
[1:01:51] the wrong scripture you're you're you
[1:01:53] guys are right I'm wrong I need certain
[1:01:55] St Mark 15:13 is that what we got yeah
[1:02:00] okay and they cried out again crucify
[1:02:08] him then pilate said unto them why what
[1:02:11] evil has he
[1:02:18] done what evil has he done and they cre
[1:02:22] out the more exceedingly crucify him
[1:02:28] and so pilate willing to contend the
[1:02:30] people released Barabas unto them and
[1:02:32] delivered Jesus when he had scored him
[1:02:34] to be
[1:02:46] crucified and the soldiers L him into
[1:02:48] the Hall called pretorium and they
[1:02:50] called together the whole
[1:02:54] band
[1:03:04] and they clothed him with
[1:03:10] purple he was
[1:03:12] naked the same as the first Adam was
[1:03:17] naked he was
[1:03:20] naked and they clothed him with
[1:03:24] purple what is
[1:03:27] purple it is a Roman
[1:03:30] Church they are called the purple
[1:03:35] curtain so they dressed him with their
[1:03:42] Doctrine but God had another garment for
[1:03:46] him and they took off that
[1:03:49] garment
[1:03:54] notice close with a
[1:03:59] garment where did he get the
[1:04:05] Garment St John
[1:04:09] 20
[1:04:10] one give you scripture so you can
[1:04:16] study the first day of the week cometh
[1:04:18] Mary Magdalene early when it was yet
[1:04:21] dark unto the Seer and see the stone
[1:04:24] taken away from the
[1:04:37] then she runneth and cometh to Simon
[1:04:41] Peter and to the other disciple whom
[1:04:44] Jesus
[1:04:48] loved and sayith unto them they have
[1:04:51] taken away the Lord out of the
[1:04:54] Seer and we know not where they have
[1:04:57] laid
[1:04:59] him Peter therefore went
[1:05:02] forth and then our disciple and came to
[1:05:05] the
[1:05:09] Seer then they ran both together and the
[1:05:12] other disciple did all run Peter and
[1:05:14] came first to The
[1:05:24] Seer and he stood
[1:05:26] down and looking in saw the lining cloth
[1:05:29] lying yet when he not
[1:05:40] in the Jesus
[1:05:44] resurrected and the garments were
[1:05:49] there notice that Mary Magdalene there
[1:05:53] did not
[1:05:54] enterd
[1:05:56] she saw the stone
[1:05:59] removed she did not go into the the
[1:06:02] tomb she ran and told Peter and Peter
[1:06:07] and John when they got to the
[1:06:11] tomb there was nobody there but the
[1:06:13] laning
[1:06:18] clothes St Mark 16
[1:06:24] Mar and when the Sabbath was passed Mary
[1:06:28] Magdalene and Mary the mother of James
[1:06:31] and
[1:06:32] salom had bought sweet spices that they
[1:06:35] might come and anoint
[1:06:50] him verse
[1:06:52] five and entering into the the
[1:06:57] sep they saw a young man sitting on the
[1:07:01] right
[1:07:02] side closed in a long white
[1:07:07] garment and they were
[1:07:12] afed ah there somebody got the Lord left
[1:07:18] left that Ling
[1:07:22] close and only somebody who was Worthy
[1:07:26] could be clothed with the same linen
[1:07:31] clothes and I already gave you the
[1:07:34] scripture in
[1:07:36] Ezekiel that the man clothed with white
[1:07:40] linen put a
[1:07:43] Mark or the
[1:07:45] seal on those that cried and S for the
[1:07:52] Abomination so
[1:07:54] John there in Revelation one he saw one
[1:07:59] like the son of
[1:08:00] man clothed with a
[1:08:04] garment you see where he got the
[1:08:09] Garment the Lord said unto my
[1:08:13] Lord we're going into something
[1:08:17] good and he was G around the
[1:08:24] peps
[1:08:26] and didn't says that the government was
[1:08:29] upon his
[1:08:33] shoulder with with the Key of
[1:08:37] David so this one like the son of
[1:08:42] man the
[1:08:45] GLE not around the
[1:08:48] waist but on the
[1:08:51] shoulder why oh keep stay with me
[1:08:57] notice the government shall be upon his
[1:09:02] shoulder when did John saw
[1:09:08] this the
[1:09:11] SC
[1:09:13] moved from the aisle of
[1:09:16] pmos to
[1:09:18] Heaven that's where John saw this one
[1:09:22] like the son of
[1:09:24] man
[1:09:26] with a
[1:09:28] girle around the shoulder it
[1:09:33] means that he was no not a
[1:09:38] priest because he says that this
[1:09:42] man had his feet like
[1:09:46] breast and breast means
[1:09:51] judgment the Lord th the SW in the
[1:09:55] Garden of
[1:09:56] Eden was a sword of
[1:09:59] judgment and like I said
[1:10:02] here he was no not in
[1:10:06] service because if he had had the girdle
[1:10:09] around the
[1:10:12] waist he would be serving the
[1:10:16] people he would be a
[1:10:19] priest but the GLE was not around the
[1:10:23] way the government shall be upon his
[1:10:29] shoulder The Sword in the Garin was a
[1:10:32] sword of
[1:10:36] judgment here he was a
[1:10:38] judge
[1:10:40] notice what it was not the son of man he
[1:10:45] was one like the son of
[1:10:48] man brother Bram Bram was in the office
[1:10:52] of
[1:10:54] priest from
[1:10:57] 1933 to February the
[1:11:02] 27
[1:11:04] 1963 brother Brandon was in the office
[1:11:07] of
[1:11:09] priest that he was picked up on that
[1:11:14] cloud in February the 28th
[1:11:19] 1963 was in the office of
[1:11:23] Judge he was
[1:11:25] judgment was
[1:11:27] coming during the time when he was a
[1:11:31] priest and when around the
[1:11:34] world he was a
[1:11:37] priest he was ministering to the
[1:11:40] people he was praying for them he was
[1:11:44] Discerning
[1:11:46] them because he was ad ministered to the
[1:11:49] people but the time came that he changed
[1:11:53] his ministry
[1:11:55] he said he told M I must go to see what
[1:12:01] the will of the Lord
[1:12:03] is and the time before he was lifted to
[1:12:07] the
[1:12:08] cloud he went up to the
[1:12:12] mountain and when his hands were
[1:12:16] up a
[1:12:18] sword a sword to his
[1:12:22] hand it was the sword that was in the
[1:12:28] praise the Lord
[1:12:31] amen there was a
[1:12:33] man who could handle the
[1:12:37] sword all the
[1:12:39] time when the when the sword was taken
[1:12:42] from the Garden of
[1:12:45] Eden and and is T was taken to
[1:12:50] heaven and when Jesus
[1:12:53] resurrected he went to the right
[1:12:58] hand but when he was
[1:13:00] there there was
[1:13:03] someone when he saw the open
[1:13:06] door and the right hand means the
[1:13:10] authority and who gave the the brother
[1:13:13] Brenham The
[1:13:15] Authority Daniel
[1:13:20] 7 no
[1:13:24] nothing notice
[1:13:35] nothing first
[1:13:38] uh give me St John
[1:13:42] 5 one single leave it there anyway St
[1:13:46] John
[1:13:48] 522 says God judges no man look here it
[1:13:52] is for the father judg no man but has
[1:13:57] committed all judgment unto the
[1:14:05] son so did he have the
[1:14:09] authority Daniel Daniel saw the same
[1:14:11] thing that John
[1:14:14] saw Daniel
[1:14:18] 7
[1:14:20] 79 I
[1:14:22] beheld till the Thrones were cast
[1:14:28] down and the Ancient of Days did
[1:14:33] sit whose garment was white as
[1:14:38] snow and the hair of his head like the
[1:14:41] pure
[1:14:46] wool then we read that in Revelation
[1:14:51] one that he hair was white as
[1:14:59] wool is the same thing that Daniel saw
[1:15:03] here he was taken to the Ancient of
[1:15:08] Days Daniel
[1:15:13] 713 I saw in the night visions and
[1:15:16] behold one like the son of
[1:15:23] man
[1:15:28] and he came with the clouds of heaven
[1:15:31] and came to the Ancient of Days and they
[1:15:34] B him before
[1:15:40] him when did this happen it happened in
[1:15:45] January 28th
[1:15:51] 1963 he was lifted up to meet the
[1:15:56] Ancient of
[1:15:59] Days whose hair was white as
[1:16:04] W the Ancient of Days how can if God is
[1:16:09] eternal God does not
[1:16:12] age the white hair not because he was
[1:16:16] old it was the
[1:16:19] wisdom it was the
[1:16:21] experience and he came he was brought
[1:16:25] before the ancient of
[1:16:29] day and the cloud where brother benen
[1:16:32] was lifted
[1:16:34] up it was the
[1:16:40] wig it was the
[1:16:44] wig the English judges put a wig in
[1:16:48] England before they
[1:16:51] judge that was where notice verse
[1:17:00] 14 and there was given him dominion and
[1:17:05] glory and a
[1:17:10] kingdom see wasn't he given
[1:17:13] Authority wasn't he given
[1:17:17] power cuz he got it from the Ancient of
[1:17:22] Days he was given all the
[1:17:26] Authority all the
[1:17:28] authority you want a
[1:17:31] squirrel oh if you if you want a
[1:17:33] squirrel ask for
[1:17:35] it Am I
[1:17:37] Dreaming squirrels do not go up poon
[1:17:43] Oak I want a squirrel on that poison
[1:17:48] oak notice
[1:17:50] Moses when he wanted a a miracle
[1:17:55] they had to do
[1:17:57] something they had to use
[1:17:59] something or get sand and thrown up in
[1:18:02] the
[1:18:03] air but this one had all the
[1:18:07] authority he said speak the
[1:18:10] word that's all he had to do is speak

[1:22:21] o is the shortest age
[1:22:25] the the age that was shortest before
[1:22:28] lady
[1:22:29] OA was
[1:22:31] Ephesus Ephesus only lasted 117
[1:22:40] years but
[1:22:42] lady it started in
[1:22:46] 1906 do the
[1:22:50] meth do the
[1:22:52] math we're in two
[1:22:56] 9 and Lady started in
[1:23:00] 1906 we've been gone almost uh 113
[1:23:06] years and this generation shall not
[1:23:11] pass in other words we cannot go to the
[1:23:15] same time as
[1:23:18] Ephesus we got four more years to go so
[1:23:22] it's between now and those four
[1:23:26] years I come
[1:23:29] quickly and the days will be
[1:23:37] Chen you have little
[1:23:40] strength why do they have little
[1:23:43] strength I Know Thy
[1:23:45] works you know why they have little
[1:23:49] strength all the
[1:23:51] ages overlap the other ages
[1:23:56] this is the age of the
[1:23:59] overlap what
[1:24:02] happened that they had to cut the days
[1:24:08] short because this the seventh Church
[1:24:14] age is the carryon of the sixth Church
[1:24:21] age and that's why it's a short age
[1:24:26] together itself for one short quick
[1:24:32] work I Know Thy works that are neither
[1:24:35] hot nor
[1:24:37] cold you have nothing but little
[1:24:41] strength you know why he has to cut the
[1:24:44] days
[1:24:45] short because all the
[1:24:49] filth all the
[1:24:51] evil of the other Church
[1:24:56] it hit the last
[1:24:58] AG it was D into lady
[1:25:05] o the last
[1:25:08] age very short
[1:25:10] age so he has to cut the work
[1:25:14] short or no flesh will be
[1:25:18] saved the open
[1:25:20] door the missionary
[1:25:23] age the you know the this the open door
[1:25:27] was in the door the Philadelphia
[1:25:32] age go to all the world and preach the
[1:25:36] gospel so Philadelphia did
[1:25:40] goph they preached all over the the
[1:25:44] world the greatest missionary age there
[1:25:48] was but they only preached the
[1:25:51] word God said do go preach the
[1:25:55] gospel because the word the letter
[1:26:00] kill they only preach the
[1:26:03] word but you got to make the word

[1:27:06] message because you and I were
[1:27:09] naked somebody had to clothe
[1:27:12] us and he says the Lord himself shall
[1:27:16] descend from heaven with a
[1:27:21] shout is a shout it is to close you it
