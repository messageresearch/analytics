[8:48] genesis 1 26 i'll pick it up wednesday
[8:52] when god made man before he made man he
[8:55] called himself
[8:57] l-e-l-l-e-l-h-l-o
[9:01] elohim
[9:03] the word means in the hebrew the self
[9:07] exists
[9:09] all by himself
[9:12] nothing existed before him he was all
[9:15] the existence he ever was
[9:18] self-existence one
[9:22] elohim
[9:24] means
[9:25] all sufficient
[9:27] all-powerful
[9:29] almighty
[9:32] self-existence
[9:34] one ah
[9:37] but in genesis 2 when he made man he
[9:40] said i am
[9:43] y-a-h-u-j-u-v-u-h
[9:47] yahuwah
[9:48] jehovah what did it mean
[9:51] i am the all existence one who has
[9:56] created something all for myself to be a
[9:59] son of mine or a temporary or an amateur
[10:06] [Music]
[10:10] why
[10:11] he gave man
[10:14] jehovah means that he gave man to be an
[10:17] amateur god
[10:19] because he is father god
[10:22] and he made a man an amateur god so he
[10:25] isn't self existence anymore he exists
[10:28] with his family
[10:30] [Music]
[10:37] now
[10:38] now he is jehovah
[10:40] jehovah meaning the one who exists with
[10:44] his family
[10:46] now god made man to be
[10:49] the predominant over all the earth he
[10:52] had dominion
[10:54] and the earth was man's dominion is that
[10:56] scripture
[10:58] then if that's his domain he was god
[11:01] over the earth
[11:04] he could speak and it would be so he
[11:05] could speak this and he would be soul
[11:11] there he is
[11:12] god jehovah
[11:15] the one who once existed
[11:18] in self-existence but now exists with
[11:20] his family and his little ones with him
[11:25] amen there you are hallelujah
[11:29] all right brother neville you got first
[11:30] peter
[11:31] 120
[11:33] but read 119 and 120. but with the
[11:37] precious blood of christ as of a lamb
[11:40] without blemish and without spot
[11:43] who verily was foreordained before the
[11:46] foundation of the world
[11:48] but was manifest in these last times for
[11:52] you
[11:53] when was he for ordained
[11:56] before the foundation of the world
[11:59] brother pat
[12:00] read revelation 17 8 for me
[12:05] these that thou shalt
[12:07] [Music]
[12:09] shall sin now
[12:11] and go into tradition
[12:14] they that dwell on the earth shall
[12:16] wonder
[12:16] whose names were not written in the book
[12:19] of life from the foundation of the world
[12:27] who's going to be deceived
[12:30] who's going to be received by this
[12:32] religious person like saul
[12:34] [Music]
[12:35] that was just so cunning and so perfect
[12:38] to it would deceive the white very e
[12:43] if
[12:45] if possible
[12:46] all right redwater says 13 8 let me read
[12:49] it for you
[12:50] and all that dwell upon the earth shall
[12:53] all
[12:54] that dwell upon the earth
[12:56] shall worship him
[12:58] whose names were not written in the book
[13:01] of life of the lamb slain
[13:04] before the foundation of the world
[13:07] [Music]
[13:08] when was our names put in the lamb's
[13:09] book of life
[13:11] when the lamb was slain before the
[13:13] foundation of the world when god was
[13:16] jehovah l
[13:17] eli
[13:18] elohim the self-existence one
[13:22] just like one great big diamond
[13:24] and he could not be nothing else but
[13:27] inside of this diamond
[13:29] his attributes was a
[13:32] savior
[13:34] amen in this attributes on the inside of
[13:37] him was a healer
[13:39] [Music]
[13:41] saving nothing to heal
[13:43] [Music]
[13:44] but his attributes produced it
[13:49] election looks back to foreknowledge
[13:52] and predestination looks the destiny
[13:55] don't forget that
[13:57] that election
[13:59] looks back here here it is but all of a
[14:02] sudden i become a wheat grain
[14:05] how did it happen
[14:07] uh that what is that election
[14:10] god before the foundation of the world
[14:13] elected that the cockaburr was to become
[14:16] a grain of wheat now i know i'm a grain
[14:18] of wheat because i'm saved how do i do
[14:20] it now let's read just a little farther
[14:24] and then we'll have to close pretty
[14:25] sharp
[14:27] according as he chose us and him before
[14:29] the foundation of the world that we
[14:32] should be holy without blame before him
[14:34] in love
[14:35] having
[14:39] predestinated us
[14:42] unto the adoption
[14:44] predestinated unto the adoption of
[14:47] children by jesus christ to himself
[14:50] according to the good pleasure of his
[14:54] will
[14:55] what did he do
[14:57] he by ford knowledge
[15:00] foresaw us
[15:02] knowing that he was a savior
[15:06] self-existence
[15:08] but in him
[15:10] was
[15:12] a savior
[15:15] well what's he going to say there's
[15:17] nothing lost
[15:19] knowing that
[15:21] that he know that this great attribute
[15:23] in him would project something out under
[15:27] that he could save
[15:29] then when he did that by four knowledge
[15:31] he looked down and he saw everyone that
[15:34] would accept it
[15:38] and while he did that he did that that
[15:41] he
[15:42] might save you who wants to be saved
[15:48] do you see what i mean
[15:51] by for knowledge amen the infinite god
[15:55] who wrote all things
[15:57] saw the lamb
[15:59] and he slayed the lamb before the
[16:01] foundation of the world and he put your
[16:04] name on the lamb's book of life and he
[16:06] seen the deceitfulness of satan what he
[16:09] would do so he put your name on there by
[16:12] election he chose them and by
[16:15] predestination they know where they are
[16:17] go in
[16:18] amen
[16:22] now who could doubt that that's what
[16:24] paul said
[16:26] that's paul's
[16:27] scripture
[16:29] that's paul's writing
[16:31] that's what he taught his church
[16:33] the church
[16:35] position
[16:36] before the foundation of the world
[16:39] when god and his labor pain
[16:42] was bringing forth
[16:44] bringing forth you knowing what you
[16:46] would do
[16:47] he positionally placed you into his own
[16:50] body
[16:52] amen

[47:18] that god has placed in the church
[47:22] have
[47:25] [Music]
[47:33] [Applause]
[47:36] amen it reads like this then he said
[47:38] unto them
[47:39] oh fools
[47:43] slow of heart
[47:45] to believe all
[47:47] that the prophets
[47:49] have spoken
[47:52] may god add his blessings to the ring of
[47:54] his word you may be seated
[48:04] amen
[48:06] i want you to keep this in mind as we
[48:09] enter into the message this morning
[48:14] that i think we all should know this
[48:18] that
[48:19] the witch
[48:22] is one who is
[48:25] impersonating
[48:27] a real true prophet of
[48:33] you god this message i'm going to say it
[48:35] again because i want you to if you have
[48:36] to write that down
[48:42] is one who is impersonating
[48:45] a real true prophet of god
[48:49] then if the witch is the impersonator
[48:54] why is it easier to believe them
[48:59] than the prophets that they are
[49:01] impersonating
[49:05] why is it easier to believe an
[49:07] impersonator than the real thing
[49:10] one person in person if you can notice
[49:12] what the lord jesus is telling them
[49:16] oh fools and slow of hearts
[49:21] you believe all that the prophets have
[49:23] spoken
[49:26] fools is one that is unintelligent
[49:41] it is one who doesn't comprehend
[49:44] perceive or understand
[49:49] i want you to notice that paul in the
[49:51] writing to the galatians
[49:56] he uses the same exact
[49:58] word that jesus used in luke 24.
[50:03] and lucas amen let's go to galatians the
[50:07] third chapter
[50:09] once again paul is using this exact same
[50:13] word when it comes to fools
[50:19] and paul starts off and says all foolish
[50:22] galatians
[50:25] i don't know about you but i do not want
[50:27] to be included when it says fools
[50:31] i don't want to be a foolish virgin
[50:35] i want to be a wise virgin
[50:38] so
[50:54] whose eyes jesus christ hath been
[50:56] evidently set forth crucified among you
[51:06] and what he's telling us here ilocano
[51:09] is the foolish part
[51:13] was that they let themselves be
[51:15] bewitched
[51:19] when you look at the word bewitched
[51:35] and the word malign means
[51:38] as an adjective it means evil in nature
[51:41] or effect
[51:44] but as a verb it means to speak about
[51:47] someone in a spitefully critical manner
[51:55] that's why he's saying all foolish
[51:57] galatians
[52:01] who does this bewitched
[52:16] in a critical manner
[52:18] i want to know is there anyone here that
[52:20] is guilty of that
[52:23] you don't have to raise your hand
[52:26] but have we have we ever been critical
[52:28] about someone
[52:30] uh i want you to get this
[52:34] because it's very important
[52:37] we wanted to we want to overcome that
[52:40] how many want to be better than what you
[52:42] are today
[52:58] and brother
[53:02] he is asking the people to pray for him
[53:07] he said because i have become very
[53:09] critical about people
[53:12] and
[53:22] i don't know how many this morning can
[53:24] be that that have that much humility
[53:35] when i look at this and i realize what
[53:37] paul is telling the galatians
[53:55] and by doing so they were falsely
[53:58] representing the gospel
[54:02] i want to tell you this morning
[54:05] as the holy spirit teaches us and leads
[54:07] us
[54:31] whether they go to church here or
[54:32] whether they don't yes
[54:35] but when they are critical about the
[54:37] church
[54:39] critical about the ministry
[54:42] critical about the brothers and sisters
[54:45] be careful
[54:47] because you're about to get bewitched
[54:51] come on now this is what is known as the
[54:53] witch's party
[54:57] right now
[54:59] you're with me
[55:01] we've got to be careful
[55:04] what we permit
[56:29] a spell on you
[56:32] what's paul's telling them
[56:35] you know because because in our minds
[56:36] many times
[56:39] the only thing we know about witches
[56:42] is a woman with a pointed nose
[56:47] around the cauldron
[56:50] but it spells on people
[56:53] that's about all we know
[56:55] let me tell you i'm going to say the
[56:56] same thing that brother branham said
[57:00] doesn't come in horns and a pitchfork
[57:04] neither do animals come like that
[57:07] they can come in a different form
[57:10] a more subtle
[57:24] when jesus
[57:36] you permit yourself to be bewitched
[57:54] i'm going to say it again
[57:55] anytime the gospel is not properly
[57:58] represented
[58:00] there is a bewitching going on
[58:04] and when we say we are christians
[58:18] [Music]
[58:20] please
[58:22] i'm going to tell you if you want to get
[58:23] that message you let us know and we'll
[58:24] get it for you
[58:29] notice
[58:31] what is going on with the galatians
[58:35] paul started the church in galatia
[58:37] during his first missionary trip
[58:43] long after he started it
[58:46] there was a group of judaizers
[58:53] which were a faction of the jewish
[58:55] christians
[58:59] that began to teach these new converts
[59:02] to christians
[59:05] that the mosaic laws of the old
[59:08] testament
[59:13] that they were still binding on all
[59:16] christians
[59:26] now that might not sound like something
[59:28] so bad huh
[59:43] that i'm trying to take you from one
[59:45] system
[59:46] to another system
[59:50] but instead you're wanting to go back to
[59:52] the old system
[59:55] instead of going forward in the news
[59:57] system
[1:00:40] i am taking
[1:00:51] the law was simply they were trying to
[1:00:54] perfect themselves under the flesh
[1:00:56] perfection
[1:00:58] the law could not perfect us
[1:01:02] paul is telling them
[1:01:04] i'll show you a more excellent way
[1:01:07] we are no longer under the
[1:01:21] you'll see where we're going here in a
[1:01:22] moment
[1:01:25] they've they told them that they were
[1:01:27] still bound to the mosaic law
[1:01:32] what they were doing was falsely
[1:01:34] representing
[1:01:35] the gospel
[1:01:49] preach to you
[1:02:17] today how many of you have received the
[1:02:19] holy ghost
[1:02:22] and he's asking them receive thee the
[1:02:23] holy ghost by the works of the law
[1:02:29] or by the hearing of faith
[1:02:33] how did you receive the spirit come on
[1:02:36] are you so foolish
[1:02:40] that you being you have begun in the
[1:02:42] spirit
[1:02:44] are ye now made perfect by the flesh
[1:03:14] a time here
[1:03:17] you started in the spirit
[1:03:20] and now you want to go back to an old
[1:03:22] covenant
[1:03:24] system
[1:03:26] i'm trying to live the lord
[1:03:42] is it not the same thing today
[1:03:45] we've come out of egypt
[1:03:47] we've come out our denomination
[1:03:50] out of a certain lifestyle
[1:03:53] we've come out of a certain system
[1:03:56] and after so many years
[1:03:59] we want to
[1:04:00] go back
[1:04:04] come on check yourselves this morning
[1:04:07] why do we even look back
[1:04:12] want you to get this church you gotta
[1:04:13] you gotta get there come with me this
[1:04:15] morning
[1:04:17] watch this now
[1:04:18] people come out of a system
[1:04:22] but the system never comes out of them
[1:04:27] think about this now
[1:04:29] we can leave wherever we were at
[1:04:32] but what is in already inside of us
[1:04:36] continues to bewitch us
[1:04:55] there is more bewitching that goes on in
[1:04:57] a church than most people even even know
[1:05:03] there's more witchcraft in a church
[1:05:09] [Music]
[1:05:19] come on now we're going somewhere this
[1:05:21] morning you're going to go along with me
[1:05:24] all right you got to put your thoughts
[1:05:25] to one side
[1:05:27] we're going on a trip this morning
[1:05:30] now watch this as they continue as we
[1:05:31] continue to go forward
[1:05:34] parents are constantly trying to
[1:05:36] undermine the very foundation of the
[1:05:39] church
[1:05:43] of apostles and prophets
[1:05:46] jesus christ being the chief cornerstone
[1:06:02] ministry
[1:06:05] i undermine the validity of the word
[1:06:08] and undermine each other
[1:06:12] why did they put this one to preach and
[1:06:13] not me
[1:06:15] i mean
[1:06:19] come on you know what i'm talking about
[1:06:22] orlando that's right
[1:06:25] hello
[1:06:33] why does this one get to sungleed more
[1:06:34] than me
[1:06:41] and why is this one put put to interpret
[1:06:53] instead of going to where you need to oh
[1:06:55] to whom you need to speak
[1:06:57] adidas
[1:07:10] [Music]
[1:07:22] and it ain't nobody's business if he
[1:07:24] decides to do that
[1:07:38] it's
[1:07:40] on if you were up here and you could
[1:07:43] feel the
[1:07:44] you could feel
[1:07:45] the spirits coming
[1:07:47] in
[1:07:50] that's enough go to the next thing
[1:07:52] is
[1:08:07] we must do things the right way
[1:08:22] what they say is i i just don't like the
[1:08:24] system in the church
[1:08:28] that's what the judies these judaizers
[1:08:31] were getting
[1:08:32] the galatians to believe
[1:08:36] that the new system of the new covenant
[1:08:39] of grace
[1:08:42] that the holy spirit through paul was
[1:08:44] implementing
[1:08:47] was not good enough on its own
[1:09:18] put a system
[1:09:27] now there's many churches all right
[1:09:29] wait till you hear that message of our
[1:09:31] founding pastor it is
[1:09:44] but not everybody can go through samuel
[1:09:46] which is the prophet
[1:09:50] what system are you going through
[1:09:53] system have you implemented in your life
[1:09:55] this system implements
[1:09:57] everybody has a system in their life
[1:10:14] let's find out where we're at
[1:10:16] how many want to find out where we're at
[1:10:21] be careful
[1:10:23] when you look at this
[1:10:25] be careful that because you don't want
[1:10:27] to give an account to god for
[1:10:29] for bewitching someone said
[1:10:34] you have an issue about something talk
[1:10:36] to me
[1:10:38] absolutely absolutely
[1:10:41] this is not a dictatorship
[1:10:44] this is the right system
[1:10:48] it's the system that god implemented
[1:10:51] how many are with me
[1:10:53] let's go on now
[1:10:55] i wanna i really wanna
[1:11:25] would go on and is going on in a church
[1:11:31] it's not easy
[1:11:33] brother braham says lord don't let me be
[1:11:35] critical
[1:11:38] lord
[1:11:53] did you know that every time you speak
[1:11:55] about somebody
[1:11:57] else
[1:12:00] you're guilty of trying to bewitch them
[1:12:07] come on witchcraft in the church
[1:12:12] you talk about a hard week this week it
[1:12:14] doesn't matter
[1:12:16] yeah we didn't want this one to come out
[1:12:17] today
[1:12:30] and you still got those little old
[1:12:32] spirits that talk to you
[1:13:02] somebody told me the other day
[1:13:05] and i'm not going to go into details
[1:13:07] but he said somebody dialed me on on
[1:13:09] accident
[1:13:13] they were going to town talking about me
[1:13:15] either is
[1:13:18] i said brother what did you do
[1:13:21] he said as soon as i heard my name i
[1:13:23] hung it up
[1:13:26] i said god bless you for that
[1:13:30] instead of hearing and hearing oh wow oh
[1:13:32] my god you know what they call me your
[1:13:34] hero bitterness and then there's all
[1:13:35] these things towards one another
[1:13:38] and then we wonder why the spirit can't
[1:13:40] move
[1:13:43] because we hold too many things
[1:13:57] it was a perfect system
[1:14:09] this is not an easy message for me to
[1:14:11] preach by any means
[1:14:40] don't do that
[1:14:42] that'll finally keep you out of the
[1:14:44] promised land
[1:14:50] i'll tell you what if i stop right there
[1:14:52] we should have a a a a a time right now
[1:14:59] or guilty of those things
[1:15:02] watch what he says it'll finally keep
[1:15:04] you out of the promised land
[1:15:33] and the moment we go from a spiritual
[1:15:36] system it is
[1:15:48] i hope you get this
[1:15:50] okay i gotta
[1:16:28] trying to get all these things ironed
[1:16:31] out
[1:17:00] who has taken you from a spiritual
[1:17:02] system
[1:17:04] brought you back to a carnal system
[1:17:08] he's asking these questions
[1:17:12] i say we should ask ourselves those
[1:17:14] questions this day
[1:17:42] angry
[1:17:46] these are spirits that anoint the people
[1:17:50] trying to bewitch them
[1:17:53] what a party these witches are having
[1:17:55] huh
[1:18:05] why
[1:18:06] is it that we don't recognize these
[1:18:08] spirits though
[1:18:11] i want you young people to understand
[1:18:13] this
[1:18:15] every one of you that's here
[1:18:17] why it's so important to guard guard
[1:18:19] your minds
[1:18:22] there's an all-out war right now
[1:18:41] homosexuals and lesbians and and all
[1:18:43] these things
[1:18:45] right and i'm wondering are our children
[1:18:47] are we watching them
[1:18:51] we just give them and say be quiet
[1:19:20] is to control your minds
[1:19:23] because be behind every spirit
[1:19:27] you got to capture the spirit
[1:19:30] behind it all
[1:19:33] system that wants to control you
[1:19:43] and depending on what system you choose
[1:19:48] to determine
[1:20:00] most likely controls the heart control
[1:20:06] what is the purpose of bewitching
[1:20:12] to control
[1:20:14] by establishing a system
[1:20:28] when we've been through this time and
[1:20:29] time again
[1:20:44] we understand that
[1:20:57] politics and religions
[1:21:00] coming out of the earth
[1:21:03] it's what is known as the image of the
[1:21:05] beast
[1:21:07] and we know that this is speaking about
[1:21:09] the united states
[1:21:11] it is in the
[1:21:27] that's what manipulates or moves these
[1:21:29] horns or powers
[1:21:32] there's a system there ion system what
[1:21:35] kind of a system a class is a system a
[1:21:38] system
[1:21:39] of witches must
[1:21:54] do you know that have you understand
[1:21:56] yeah see and jezebel
[1:21:58] he says is a type of the catholic church
[1:22:03] therefore
[1:22:05] it is a jezebel system
[1:22:08] that's
[1:22:21] or that came forth from the beast
[1:22:31] and watch it
[1:22:32] use scripture if it is
[1:22:39] he says in the philadelphia church
[1:22:46] that has started on what seems such a
[1:22:48] beautiful and blessed principles
[1:23:01] [Music]
[1:23:03] and everybody's like wow we're tired of
[1:23:06] fighting
[1:23:08] oh let's just be one and be at peace
[1:23:12] you're about to get bewitched
[1:23:16] all he's got to do is grab your
[1:23:17] attention
[1:24:00] or through
[1:24:10] so that no people will be recognized as
[1:24:13] actual churches
[1:24:25] under direct
[1:24:27] or indirect domination of this council
[1:24:33] denomination
[1:24:35] he says the churches
[1:24:37] are being
[1:24:38] bewitched
[1:24:41] by this ecumenical council
[1:24:44] economical
[1:24:45] what's the bewitching going on
[1:24:49] the bewitching once again
[1:24:51] is the implementation of a system
[1:24:56] august 23rd 1948.
[1:25:01] of churches
[1:25:07] for what purpose
[1:25:09] to implement
[1:25:23] but a stir of the foolish virgins
[1:25:30] to be left here on earth for a picking
[1:25:33] for the antichrist
[1:25:37] enjoy that on wednesday
[1:25:53] why
[1:25:54] did the
[1:25:55] did the wise virgins have oil and the
[1:25:57] foolish didn't or
[1:25:58] not
[1:26:02] because the wise were willing to be
[1:26:04] pressed
[1:26:06] on
[1:26:17] praise god and lord bless me and keep on
[1:26:20] bringing the blessings lord your
[1:26:22] allowance and yourself we don't want to
[1:26:23] suffer about nothing no no they don't
[1:26:25] want to be pressed
[1:26:28] but it's only through pressure
[1:26:33] and she was not willing to do
[1:27:14] image of the beast
[1:27:30] it's like people that smoke cigarettes
[1:27:34] but now they vape
[1:27:38] it's the same nicotine
[1:27:41] and just repackaged so that it's not oh
[1:27:43] no it's different namaste
[1:27:56] what's their message
[1:28:03] i believe we do fulfill that scripture
[1:28:07] but not one our way
[1:28:09] not one in that system
[1:28:12] one in christ
[1:28:15] stop and think about this
[1:28:17] i was trying to help a couple the other
[1:28:18] day

[1:28:30] marriage
[1:28:32] yeah okay who's supposed to be the three
[1:28:35] questions
[1:28:38] god
[1:28:39] husband and wife
[1:28:42] and i said so so what watch this how
[1:28:45] simple it is
[1:28:47] here's the here's christ
[1:28:52] here's the wife on this side
[1:28:54] and
[1:29:03] because that's the system in the home
[1:29:07] come
[1:29:08] on come on there's a system set up in
[1:29:11] your home
[1:29:13] and unless you break down that system
[1:29:14] and put it in the right system
[1:29:17] you're not going to get nowhere

[1:29:35] the husband is on this side yeah
[1:29:49] that's what their system tells them
[1:29:52] but the system of god tells us

[1:31:44] is what they're they're planning it
[1:31:45] should be done next year i think
[1:31:50] this is in in the united arab emirates
[1:31:52] isn't it
[1:31:53] they know how to be
[1:31:55] that over here is
[1:31:59] that over here is a synagogue
[1:32:02] that over there is a church
[1:32:05] it was the pope and the leader there of
[1:32:07] the emirates
[1:32:10] that
[1:32:39] the curtains
[1:32:43] but all they see is oh yes let's be one
[1:32:45] brother
[1:32:48] what a false unity
[1:32:51] i want you to get it because this this
[1:32:53] is so important
[1:32:56] just goes so so fast
[1:32:59] watch this now this we're just going to
[1:33:01] keep on going because we don't have
[1:33:02] service this afternoon
[1:33:05] watch us down
[1:33:08] the process
[1:33:11] of breaking you down
[1:33:15] of breaking you down
[1:33:18] watch this now this this fascinated me
[1:33:22] i don't know how many of you have ever
[1:33:23] heard of the
[1:33:25] of of
[1:33:26] of this
[1:33:27] um
[1:33:29] it's a system
[1:33:31] of
[1:33:34] conquering one nation or one idea
[1:33:36] conquering another nation or an idea
[1:33:40] of ideological subversion
[1:33:46] yeah it's real
[1:33:48] the inspiration of that line came from
[1:33:50] somewhere
[1:33:52] some man just came up with it no no no
[1:33:54] no no
[1:33:55] a man was anointed
[1:33:57] and that that idea essay there it became
[1:34:02] it was manifest
[1:34:04] now i i i i'm going to go slow here
[1:34:06] because i want you to get this
[1:34:09] remember
[1:34:10] don't just take the natural what i'm
[1:34:11] saying apply it to the spirit
[1:34:15] because you got to know your enemies
[1:34:30] this there was an interview done in
[1:34:32] 1984.
[1:34:35] on this subject of ideological
[1:34:37] subversion
[1:34:39] it was an ex-kgb agent
[1:34:43] what is this ideological subversion
[1:34:47] it's a slow
[1:34:49] brainwashing process
[1:34:57] to change
[1:34:59] your perception of reality
[1:35:04] now take it in the spiritual because
[1:35:06] this is tremendous to me
[1:35:12] watch as there are four stages
[1:35:16] of this subversion
[1:35:19] number one
[1:35:22] number one i don't know if i gave it to
[1:35:24] you all or not maybe i didn't
[1:35:26] maybe not number one
[1:35:30] the first stage
[1:35:32] is demoralization
[1:35:36] write this down
[1:35:38] this is the way the enemy will attack
[1:35:40] you he'll get
[1:35:46] watch watch how tremendous
[1:35:48] demoralizes two things
[1:35:53] it's to cause someone to lose confidence
[1:35:58] or esperanza
[1:36:00] the spirit them
[1:36:05] i have nothing to live for
[1:36:06] no i don't want to go to church nothing
[1:36:08] will happen
[1:37:03] the crazy thing is that it happens at
[1:37:07] such a slow pace
[1:37:10] and it happens right between our eyes
[1:37:13] right in front of our eyes and we don't
[1:37:14] even recognize it
[1:37:16] the next thing you know
[1:37:18] this all the time
[1:37:38] this is tremendous watch watch this
[1:37:40] we're going to get to something so
[1:37:41] tremendous like i still got into a bit
[1:37:42] of time watch this now
[1:37:44] he said this is what he said yesterday
[1:37:48] the demoralization 1984.
[1:37:52] the demoralization process of the united
[1:37:54] states
[1:37:57] is basically complete established
[1:38:02] and has been
[1:38:04] for the last 25 years
[1:38:09] take 1984
[1:38:11] and take away 25 years
[1:38:22] 1959.
[1:38:24] okay now watch he says
[1:38:26] it has been completed for the past
[1:38:29] 25 years
[1:38:33] think of this now
[1:38:35] brother branham preaches the message
[1:38:38] 1954
[1:38:41] the invasion of the united states
[1:38:45] and he's watching this demoralization
[1:38:48] happen
[1:38:49] right before his eyes
[1:38:52] 1956.
[1:38:55] america has turned
[1:39:13] it was accomplished
[1:39:16] and if you can get the ones in power
[1:39:18] converted
[1:39:21] they're the ones that do the work for
[1:39:22] the enemy
[1:39:39] the problem problem is what they don't
[1:39:40] know is that behind the scenes
[1:39:44] there is a system that's been
[1:39:46] implemented
[1:39:49] now think of this
[1:39:51] americans los americans
[1:40:32] it doesn't matter how much truth you
[1:40:33] tell them
[1:40:43] [Music]
[1:40:48] another ideology another system has
[1:40:50] taken over
[1:40:53] and the person didn't even know when it
[1:40:54] happened
[1:40:56] maybe it started with one of those
[1:40:58] little conversations with somebody he
[1:40:59] says
[1:41:02] i don't think that's right
[1:41:06] wow watch it we're going to say foolish
[1:41:08] galatians
[1:41:13] the next stage
[1:41:14] does he get that
[1:41:15] stabilization yes and i'm not going to
[1:41:17] go through a lot of this because it's my
[1:41:20] time is already leaving
[1:41:23] destabilization
[1:41:25] is to create a situation
[1:41:28] which reduces the power or influence of
[1:41:30] a government or person
[1:41:35] when people would love to hear the
[1:41:36] pastor what do you have to say
[1:41:40] after they've been demoralized
[1:42:01] watch this now
[1:42:03] it's to upset the stability or
[1:42:05] equilibrium
[1:42:09] of the system that is
[1:42:23] this second stage only takes about two
[1:42:25] to five years
[1:43:06] i've ever preached to you something in
[1:43:08] the name of the lord take it this
[1:43:09] morning
[1:43:14] which is a crisis
[1:43:16] then you're gonna find yourself in a
[1:43:18] crisis
[1:43:20] and this only it only takes about six
[1:43:22] weeks at this point
[1:43:26] it then brings on this is what a crisis
[1:43:28] does
[1:43:30] it brings on a violent change of power
[1:43:34] structure and economy
[1:43:51] you have been
[1:43:54] demoralized
[1:43:57] you have been
[1:43:58] destabilized yes
[1:44:00] you've been to the crisis
[1:44:02] and now you're in normalization oh that
[1:44:04] doesn't normally
[1:44:23] and this may last indefinitely
[1:44:27] it makes everything normal to you
[1:44:31] normally
[1:44:34] um
[1:44:35] some of you are getting it
[1:44:37] some of you are not
[1:44:39] going to go back and hear it again
[1:44:42] that's why the bible says be not
[1:44:43] conformed to this world
[1:45:00] be not conformed to this world no it's
[1:45:02] confirmed
[1:45:04] transform
[1:45:05] of your mind
[1:45:08] and bring on a new system
[1:45:11] paul is trying and struggling
[1:45:55] we must know our enemy at every trick
[1:46:02] and the great dragon
[1:46:04] was cast out
[1:46:07] that old serpent
[1:46:25] put that up there if you would
[1:46:27] i know i did give you this one
[1:46:34] because as the great dragon
[1:46:37] come on
[1:46:38] he's a persecutor
[1:47:18] am i being accused
[1:47:26] when we look at this
[1:47:28] we see that all hell is against us
[1:47:33] brother brown tells us that when he was
[1:47:35] out in in germany i believe it was
[1:47:39] he said there was 15 witches
[1:47:46] because they wanted to disrupt the
[1:47:47] services
[1:47:51] you may believe me or not it says
[1:47:54] one of the last times not last time but
[1:47:55] before when we were in uganda
[1:48:00] brother diego were there were there
[1:48:02] witches that were sitting in the
[1:48:03] congregation
[1:48:05] it was full of nothing but pastors
[1:48:09] and there were witches there inside
[1:48:10] there
[1:48:11] yeah
[1:48:13] we don't go it's not a vacation
[1:48:16] which is there
[1:48:56] [Applause]
[1:48:59] pastors
[1:49:00] received the message
[1:49:04] it was another system
[1:49:08] oh church i want you to get there you
[1:49:10] don't get a great system
[1:49:54] he's the one with his feet
[1:49:56] and let's look at one feet on the sea
[1:49:58] and one foot on the earth
[1:50:00] meaning he's got control over it
[1:50:03] they have their time
[1:50:05] they have their parties
[1:50:07] when their work is done
[1:50:22] how many are with me
[1:50:49] that's the easy
[1:50:50] thing but what's the solution
[1:50:54] don't come and tell me there's a problem
[1:50:56] let's find what the solution is
[1:51:00] when i look at this
[1:51:02] it says we've applied in the healing
[1:51:04] services
[1:51:16] but what about demons in the spiritual
[1:51:32] and that and that's okay and there
[1:51:34] wasn't a temper
[1:51:35] sickness that's going on
[1:51:39] has happened
[1:51:43] unless we get that fix
[1:51:46] we'll get sick
[1:51:56] this is so tremendous to me
[1:51:59] they say oh
[1:52:01] if i could
[1:52:02] only quit lying now we're going to the
[1:52:04] soul
[1:52:07] if i could only quit lusting
[1:52:09] if i could only quit this or that
[1:52:14] that's
[1:52:41] someone said brother you think it's
[1:52:44] wrong to do a certain thing
[1:52:47] yes by you asking that
[1:52:50] shows that there's something wrong there
[1:52:53] or you wouldn't be asking oh no
[1:52:56] yes or yes coc why why don't we use that
[1:52:59] all the time
[1:53:00] every time we before we get into trouble
[1:53:02] use that
[1:53:05] right the moment you ask yourself leave
[1:53:07] it alone
[1:53:12] i'm coming around the corner
[1:53:15] a little bit big corner but it's we're
[1:53:17] coming around
[1:53:20] if a man or woman could ever get their
[1:53:22] thoughts
[1:53:24] and their testimony
[1:53:38] what would
[1:54:20] if the children could line up with the
[1:54:22] mama
[1:54:25] and the mama could line up with the
[1:54:26] daddy
[1:54:28] the daddy could line up with the word
[1:54:32] you would have one of the greatest
[1:54:33] homes that ever existed
[1:54:47] nobody tells me you know not under your
[1:54:49] system not amazing no no no no
[1:54:52] one's going to take you
[1:54:56] watch this
[1:54:57] can i have like 10 minutes
[1:55:04] look
[1:55:06] what happens is that we don't deal with
[1:55:08] the soul
[1:55:12] we confess
[1:55:13] we must confess
[1:55:15] necessary
[1:55:16] but
[1:55:29] there's something wrong somewhere
[1:55:35] that's because you've got an
[1:55:36] intellectual faith
[1:55:40] and not a faith from your heart
[1:55:43] i love that
[1:55:44] gusta
[1:55:58] when you say
[1:56:26] it could be so but i don't believe it
[1:56:30] intellectual faith
[1:56:32] on the inside
[1:56:36] get it
[1:56:37] outside you say yes
[1:56:40] but inside your conscience you say no
[1:56:44] no are you afraid of this no i know
[1:56:46] you're not in cyber
[1:56:50] shaking
[1:56:55] there's a weakness somewhere
[1:56:57] and the weakness is because we go after
[1:56:59] man's doctrine and enticing spirits
[1:57:03] instead of coming back to the word
[1:57:06] so many people are listening to enticing
[1:57:34] i'm a minister i have a right to talk
[1:57:35] about whatever i want to whoever i want
[1:57:40] these demons
[1:57:42] go into places
[1:57:44] and they get amongst men
[1:57:49] they get amongst
[1:57:50] church members
[1:57:53] they get amongst good people
[1:57:56] and they cause them to come into
[1:57:57] illusion
[1:58:00] and they say things and do things it is
[1:58:01] serious
[1:58:02] teach things
[1:58:04] practice things
[1:58:19] under disguise
[1:58:22] they're good at hiding
[1:58:28] oh pastor i love you so much
[1:58:31] [Music]
[1:58:44] oh we're a quiet bunch
[1:58:58] you say
[1:59:03] well brother i'm not a witch
[1:59:06] i don't do witchcraft
[1:59:08] i don't partake in those things
[1:59:11] praise god
[1:59:12] let me ask you a question
[1:59:14] when the lord
[1:59:28] this is what i'm talking about putting a
[1:59:29] little another disguise and look at the
[1:59:31] orlando what's halloween's all about
[1:59:33] halloween
[1:59:35] right
[1:59:37] doctrines of devils
[1:59:39] diablo fighting and behind the skies
[1:59:52] do you rebel or are you obedient to the
[1:59:54] world
[2:00:22] an idolatry
[2:00:32] because thou has rejected the word of
[2:00:35] the lord
[2:00:37] and because thou has rejected he told
[2:00:39] him
[2:00:42] i also have rejected from binky
[2:00:47] who has bewitched you is what the
[2:00:49] question is
[2:00:51] there's no
[2:00:52] peace no i passed there's just fighting
[2:00:54] everywhere
[2:00:55] in the home
[2:00:56] and the church
[2:00:58] in the country
[2:01:02] second kings 9 22
[2:01:05] and it came to pass when joram saw jehu
[2:01:08] he said is it peace jehu
[2:01:10] and he answered
[2:01:12] what peace
[2:01:13] so long as the whoredoms of thy mother
[2:01:16] jezebel and her witchcrafts are so many
[2:01:19] i pass
[2:01:26] it was a system that was controlling i'm
[2:01:28] going to i'm just going to hit this real
[2:01:29] quick and then i'll and then i'll i'll
[2:01:30] stop
[2:01:33] it's the system
[2:01:36] think about it
[2:01:38] our bodies are full of systems
[2:01:41] there's like 10 12
[2:01:43] systems in the body
[2:01:45] muscular system and the nervous system
[2:01:48] cardiovascular and the respiratory and
[2:01:50] the digestive and all these things
[2:01:54] one of the systems is not functioning
[2:01:56] right
[2:02:00] that's what satan did he disrupted the
[2:02:02] system
[2:02:57] people bound
[2:03:23] is the plan of redemption
[2:03:42] and then we wonder why
[2:03:44] the little boys and little girls don't
[2:03:45] even know today if they're boys or girls
[2:03:51] sex
[2:03:52] and wondering what it's all about
[2:03:57] the wrong system
[2:04:00] thank god for a godly father and mother
[2:04:06] you know i i i hear the different i hear
[2:04:09] the different testimonies
[2:04:12] when i hear them in hell these how the
[2:04:13] lord brought people from different walks
[2:04:15] of life
[2:04:18] i cried and i said thank you lord
[2:04:20] gracias thank you for bringing them
[2:04:30] there are people that have said
[2:04:32] not everybody was blessed to have a
[2:04:34] uncle tommy and antiviola authentication
[2:04:49] foreign
[2:05:03] maybe i just don't know a lot of things
[2:05:04] about life
[2:05:07] but then he comes back and tells me
[2:05:10] for a reason
[2:05:12] so that you could show people
[2:05:15] that it is impossible to live
[2:05:17] a greater life that's why i kept you but
[2:05:21] it's just getting worse
[2:05:22] that's the system like you grew up in
[2:05:24] your home
[2:05:27] father and your mother
[2:05:29] they put forth a system in your home
[2:06:01] oh
[2:06:02] i don't have the other testimony
[2:06:08] where god brought you from
[2:06:11] where he has brought us to uh
[2:06:52] is
[2:08:24] [Music]
[2:08:34] he begins
[2:08:38] [Applause]
[2:09:01] what we're talking about
[2:09:44] it
[2:09:47] sat there and i just cried and cried
[2:09:54] because i could see
[2:09:57] where we're going
[2:10:25] as brother brown describes it thousands
[2:10:26] and
[2:10:54] i'm remembering what
[2:11:34] he said the crown that was put upon the
[2:11:36] heads of the people
[2:11:39] he said it fits so perfect
[2:11:45] church when the saying comes to dispirit
[2:11:47] you
[2:11:49] battle a long time don't you let him
[2:11:51] understand
[2:11:55] we're almost home
[2:11:58] nothing take it away from us
[2:12:04] like this
[2:12:29] and man it felt so good
[2:12:32] i sat down
[2:12:46] this
[2:13:00] he laid it at the
[2:13:02] at the feet of the one that was on the
[2:13:04] throne
[2:13:07] i never did anything to deserve this
[2:13:11] never about me
[2:13:14] about the lord jesus christ
[2:13:16] your honor doesn't belong to me all
[2:13:18] honor belongs to him
[2:13:20] he took his crown off and laid it at the
[2:13:22] feet of jesus
[2:13:24] turned around and walked away he said
[2:13:27] brother peterson says
[2:13:42] at all
[2:13:55] the whole time
[2:14:24] because there
[2:15:18] maybe it's time that
[2:15:20] our system
[2:15:23] it says this time that our system is
[2:15:24] changed
[2:15:27] there will only be one system
[2:15:30] as he is the king
[2:15:33] on his throne as son of david in the
[2:15:35] millennium
[2:15:38] there's a system already in place
[2:15:41] not going to happen it's already
[2:15:42] happening
[2:15:45] hearts of the bride of christ
[2:15:48] but now i ask you with every headboat
[2:15:54] how many of you
[2:15:58] say the system i'm under don't let me do
[2:16:00] a lot of things
[2:16:16] if there's somebody that says brother
[2:16:17] again
[2:16:19] i need a change
[2:16:21] and you're tired of those devils
[2:16:23] tormenting you
[2:16:26] and i say today is your day
[2:16:29] because he gave me this message
[2:16:32] and if he gave it to me
[2:16:34] it's because i believe he will vindicate
[2:16:36] it
[2:16:38] that it's the truth
[2:16:40] what i have taught you okay
[2:16:43] is nothing but the truth so help
[2:16:51] you say brother
[2:16:53] i need i need some help today
[2:16:56] i'm gonna ask if all the ministers would
[2:16:58] come real quick
[2:17:06] and i want you any of the people that
[2:17:08] want to come hold on make me the people
[2:17:09] just hold on until we get the ministers
[2:17:11] up here

[3:11:03] gracious
[3:11:05] [Applause]
[3:11:20] uh good morning and god bless you all
[3:11:24] this past summer in june we took my dad
[3:11:27] to the doctor
[3:11:32] and discovered that he had a very large
[3:11:34] aneurysm in his aorta
[3:11:38] [Music]
[3:11:40] basically the length of his abdomen and
[3:11:44] twice the normal width of your aorta
[3:11:47] established
[3:11:48] abdomen
[3:11:52] there were no local doctors that could
[3:11:54] operate on him so we had to take him to
[3:11:56] a specialist in albuquerque
[3:12:02] on
[3:12:03] in albuquerque the specialist that saw
[3:12:05] my dad said that he had never seen an
[3:12:07] aneurysm of that size before because
[3:12:09] they typically burst
[3:12:11] before they get that big
[3:12:13] specialist
[3:12:15] [Music]
[3:12:26] [Music]
[3:12:29] when we went to the youth camp in july
[3:12:32] um we had a service with testimonies and
[3:12:34] specials
[3:12:36] and julia
[3:12:38] specialist testimonials
[3:12:40] and i gave a pre-testimony the
[3:12:44] testimonial
[3:12:47] at that time my dad's surgery wasn't
[3:12:48] scheduled until september
[3:12:58] but i wanted to claim the victory then
[3:13:00] and as auntie laura said sometimes you
[3:13:02] just have to force the vision.
[3:13:11] after i got done with my testimony
[3:13:13] brother seth prayed for my dad and there
[3:13:15] was something very special in that
[3:13:16] prayer
[3:13:18] testimonial
[3:13:23] that really helped me in the months to
[3:13:25] come and especially during the surgery
[3:13:32] it was really simple he didn't ask for
[3:13:35] the surgery to go well he just simply
[3:13:37] complained
[3:13:39] he simply
[3:13:40] claimed
[3:13:52] um i believe that that was under the
[3:13:54] inspiration of the holy spirit and it
[3:13:56] stayed with me throughout the month
[3:14:03] on september the 17th my dad had his
[3:14:06] surgery
[3:14:10] the doctor had said it would be a three
[3:14:12] to four hour surgery
[3:14:17] with povid protocols we were not allowed
[3:14:19] to be in the hospital so we just had to
[3:14:21] wait by the phone when regulars
[3:14:26] at four hours um the call never came so
[3:14:30] i called the hospital to see how he was
[3:14:32] doing yeah
[3:14:38] they said just a little bit longer he's
[3:14:40] almost done
[3:14:44] at six hours the call didn't come inside
[3:14:47] about the hospital same same answer says
[3:14:55] at that time we knew that something just
[3:14:57] wasn't quite right and we began to put
[3:15:00] the call out for prayers
[3:15:09] but for me brother seth's prayer stuck
[3:15:12] in my head i just kept hearing complete
[3:15:15] healing
[3:15:31] they had to completely open his abdomen
[3:15:34] because one of the major arteries in his
[3:15:36] intestines had ruptured and they had to
[3:15:37] repair it
[3:15:43] in the course of that time we went
[3:15:45] through several
[3:15:46] surgeries several operations
[3:15:54] um but we went for his follow-up
[3:15:55] appointment um on this past monday
[3:16:00] nuevo
[3:16:12] there were several times they said he
[3:16:14] was going to have lasting after effects
[3:16:16] but when we talked to the doctor on
[3:16:17] monday he is healed
[3:16:25] so i just have one more ask for everyone
[3:16:28] a petition
[3:16:35] thank you all for your prayers
[3:16:47] we thank the lord for those wonderful
[3:16:48] testimonies
