richly bless you God bless uh thank to our pastor this evening for the confidence he's bestowed upon us amen and we want to get straight into the word let's just uh read read a scripture just to just so we can uh be seated and it's going to be found in Psalms 42 I'm just going to read the first verse uh so we can be seated after as the heart panteth after the water Brooks so panteth my soul after thee oh God amen you can be seated so I want you to know first off tonight that I have some I have some jumping shouting praise God material let me let me repeat it to you I I got some jumping and shouting praise God material amen amen so I'm going to explain to you in just a bit now now first off uh brother brother Jimmy is he here no well brother Jimmy would sure be proud of me tonight because uh as I was uh studying for this or as I was just going through this message as the Lord was bringing it to me I I I thought to myself well what's the title going to be and as you can see it's images of Christ uh with a subtitle a Victor's Crown right but then as the message continued to keep coming well I thought well why leave it with just two two titles why don't we just add on to their I know I know take it back take it back God can do it so that's why I'm telling you we got some praise God material tonight so brother Jimmy would be proud because you know but uh now now like I said it's it's going to be jumping and shouting now I don't know if I'm going to get excited tonight I never plan or well I always plan to be excited because it's God's word but I never plan to do the stuff that I do sometimes now uh I'm going to read some stuff to you a little different tonight and so just before I came down here I I got a lovely text message I I got to I got to confess I got a lovely text message and it said don't scream with a heart thank you honey so I'm going to try not to scream but that's never I never ever guarantee okay you guys help me out today all right okay so let me see what time it is let me do some math in my head real fast okay I think we're good and so uh now to all the Believers this uh like I said you can say Amen anytime you want amen so uh so I I was telling my wife uh you know every time I preach I tell her oh did you understand what I was saying I said because I I forgot to say half of the stuff I man I left this out I'll start going over my notes again and I and I I I look back and I oh I forgot to say oh man I left out this good part I thought I thought one of these days I'm going to I'm going to preach a sermon and I'm going to title it unfinished sermons just five more minutes right so it kind of reminded me of a time that brother Anthony and I we were we were hunting and we saw some deer on the side of a hill and so we get down we put our glasses on and we range the deer he says it's 550 yards I get on the rifle and I'm like oh I can take that shot in my sleep so we're waiting for this deer to come he's got his head in the trees and uh I'm on there waiting just waiting and waiting he's eating and the light Fades away and I turned to brother Anthony right and as the light's done uh he lifts his head up and he was one of those deer that you you dream about right but I I wasn't going to shoot him and brother Anthony looks at me he says this is from now on called two minute Hill cuz we just needed two more minutes now how many remembers the story that I told you about God did it amen you all remember it it was about a widow lady who she uh had ran out of food she was praying every day for food just to rec real quick and and so she she starts to pray and her neighbor was an atheist and uh he overheard her praying you know she had her window open and so he says oh there I'm going to show her who God is y all remember the story and so he he uh comes and he puts uh food on her on her on her porch and she opens up the porch one day door and she says Oh Glory to God God did it right and so the guy comes over and he's like what are you so happy about you know he was one of those negative kind of people you know like kind of reminds me of me sometimes oh that's never going to work out what you so happy about he said I had no food and I prayed to God and he answered my prayer said no no I uh I put the food there no God did it right and so he said no no no you're not understanding there there's no such thing as God you had a need and I provided for you no God did it he started getting angry and uh so he says uh no no I did it no she said no let let me make something straight here God did it and he made the devil pay for it right so I want you to know tonight that God can do it how many knows that God is able to do it how many knows that whatever your circumstance is tonight you can look at the enemy in his eyes and you can tell him God did it I'm here today in 2024 because God did it it was God who did it the reason I can move around today is because God did it and I believe tonight that God still can do it amen now am now let me let me let me give a little disclosure it's not going to be easy that's right right it's not going to be that easy but uh let's let's finish our scripture here right and it says uh David as the heart panteth after the water Brook so panteth my soul after thee Oh God my soul thirst is for God for the Living God When shall I come and appear before God my tears have been my meat day and night while they continually say unto me where is thy God when I remember these things I pour out my soul in me for I have gone for I had gone with the multitudes I went with them to the house of God with the voice of joy and praise with a multitude that kept holy [Music] day why are thou cast down oh my soul and why are thou disquieted in me hope thou in God for I shall yet praise him for the of his countenance oh my God my soul is cast down Within Me therefore will I remember thee from the land of Jordan and to the harmonites from the hill of the misar calleth unto the Deep at the noise of thy water spouts all thy waves and thy Billows are gone over me yet the Lord will command his loving kindness in the daytime and in the night his song shall be with me and my prayer unto God of my life I will say unto God my rock why hast thou forgotten me why go I mourning because of the oppression of my enemies as with a sword in my bones my enemies in my bones my enemies approach me while they say daily unto me where is thy God why are thou cast down oh my soul and why are thou dis disqui within me hope thou in God for I shall yet praise him who is the health of my countenance and my God and so we see here David is in distress brother Bram says as he reads this scripture he says I think David in the writing of this Psalm must have been been in [Music] distress and it usually takes distress to bring the best out of a man it really that's when God gets down to when we fast many times to get ourselves in position we got to get ourselves in position it's it's time that we change positions right like a football game when you're on you're on defense you're you're defending all the time you don't know what the enemy is going to do but it's time that we change positions and now it's time for us to go on offense now we got to get the devil we got to confuse him now it's time for us to change the place now he's got to worry about what we're going to do we're always worried about what he's going to do but to get ourselves in position to get ourselves out of the way and I think when David got in this place then he began to meditate on the Lord began to think about the things many times God gets us into tight Corners where we have to look up sometimes we even have to get on our back in the hospital or a bed somewhere so we can look up to see where the blessings of God come [Music] from now keep in mind through throughout the message images of Christ right what's our purpose here talk to yourself tonight right and and ask yourself what what's our purpose here why why are we here are we here to to advance ourselves in in in our careers are we here to uh maybe make a lot of money live in a comfortable home go out and eat every weekend go out on vacation right those things are fine right is that our purpose is for being here or is it to be is it to be an image of Christ right now with a show of hands how many wants to be an image of Christ how many Christians do we have tonight we got about majority so for the ones that didn't raise your hand hands uh how many would want to be a Christian wow so we got some that rais their hands they they're Christians there was some that didn't raise their hands because they weren't Christians and then the question is asked how many wants to be a Christian and no more hands I'll give you another opportunity how many Christians do we have tonight okay better now what is a Christian somebody answer me what what what is a Christian to be Christlike amen okay therefore uh so many times we hear the expression oh what is a Christ what is a Christian some people limit it to joining a church someone said well a Christian is a church member someone who takes up their afflictions with the church affiliations with the church I believe that all Christians should do that but I don't believe that that's Christianity that's what a Christian does after he becomes a Christian but I I don't mean or it doesn't mean that because he does it that he's a Christian then some say no it's going to church and serving a declaration of Creeds and being loyal to those things in which the church teaches and then there are others that say that perhaps packing a little something something on them a little Cross or something that that is a sign of a Christian well and then there's others who believe that perhaps maybe if they would burn a candle or do something some kind of penance that that's a Christian if they will merely merely be immersed in water or they will do some sacrif or give some good to the church or help the neighbor buy some coal for the Widow uh maybe buy some shoes for the orphan that's the acts that a Christian should do but that still doesn't make them a Christian and then some say that if you pack an image of Christ in your car or on your wall that is a sign of a Christian well them things are all right but I don't believe that packing an image makes you a Christian I believe that being an image of Christ makes you a Christian if it's not what you do outwardly outwardly it's what happened inwardly that makes us what we are then therefore if he is our image and we are in his likeness and members of his body we should be images like him then our lives should reflect the image of Christ not in joining a church or packing a crucifix or emotions but it should be the living presence of the Living God that reflects through your life so let me ask the question again how many Christians do we have here tonight right is his life are you an image or a reflection of his life to be Christlike now let me ask you do you want to be the image of Christ now now I want to read over in Mark 11 right and it's going to be found in 11 verse 12 and it says and on the tomorrow when they were come from Bethany he was hungry and seen a fig tree from far off having leaves so this scripture kind of got me a little got me here so Jesus was hungry right we we've seen that scen before right when he was being tempted of the devil right Jesus was hungry and in the passion version it's it's something great when when Satan comes to Jesus and and he this is how I'm going to paraphrase it for you this is how it reads he comes to Jesus and he says how can you be the Son of God and be hungry right how many sons of God do we have here okay so he it's funny for us everything's impossible possible Right but for the devil he knows he comes to Jesus and he's kind of confused he says how can you be the Son of God and be hungry if you're hungry then turn these stones into bread it wasn't a big task it wasn't something that Satan was going oh he's the son of God he just turned no it was something common if you're hungry why don't you turn the stones to bread so then Jesus finds himself hungry here again and he sees a tree right and as he comes to this tree and I'm going to read it to you in this version and the next day as he left Bethany Jesus was feeling hungry he noticed a leafy fig tree or a man maybe I don't know it says a tree but we know that the Bible says that they were trees right type he men were like trees and he was hungry and I wonder how many times he's ever come to me and he was hungry right and he saw me from a far off and and he saw me and I was real leafy he he noticed a leafy fig tree in the distance so he walked over it there see if there was any fruit on it he wanted to see if he could see his reflection in that tree he wanted to see if he could see his image in that tree because for God nothing is impossible he could have easily gone to that tree walked up to it saw that there was no fruit just like in front of Satan he could have made the stones into bread but brother Brown said he wasn't a showof it wasn't his time yet to show his power right and he could have come to this tree and he could have easily said bear fruit I'm hungry seems to me like he could he noticed fig tree in the distance so he walked over to see if there was any fruit on it but there was none only religion it was only full of religion it had all the quotes on it it had every scripture on it it bought for the widows it did certain penances it did all these things that we just read but it wasn't a reflection it didn't have the Life of Christ now I'm talking about a tree and Jesus I'm going to read it back in the King James version and seen the feig tree a far off and came to it in verse vers 13 if happily if happily that's what it says in English right if happily he might find anything there on doesn't that sound like the Rich Young rulers right he came to the Rich Young the Rich Young Ruler came to him and he was sad because he loved him when he when he came to him he was probably happy and then he saw that there was no fruit there right so happily he wanted to take fruit but then there was no fruit there but he found nothing but leaves that he might find something there on and when he came to it he found nothing but leaves for the time of figs was not yet and Jesus answered that's strange answered what the verse before he just said he he was hungry he was hungry okay I'm hungry oh I see a tree oh there's no fruit there oh and then Jesus answered who who did he answer did he answer nobody asked him anything no nobody presented a question to him but Jesus answered and said unto it did the tree talk to him did the tree explain why no no there it's not the time of figs yet I I don't have no fruit right now you know it's not time and Jesus answered and said unto it no man eat fruit of thee Hereafter forever and his disciples heard it wow is that kind of strange and then and then the in verse 20 and in the morning as they passed by they saw the fig tree dried up from the roots and Peter calling to remembrance sayth unto him Master behold the Fig Tree which thou curses is withered away where in the scripture before that did it ever say that he cursed the tree it doesn't say that he cursed the tree it says that he went to the tree went to go get fruit it was covered in religion and he answered it saying no man eat fruit from thee anymore and the disciples heard it nowhere does it say that it was cursed just like in the Garden of Eden he never cursed the man but he cursed the ground the ground in which it was planted was cursed because it did not bear the image and that's why many times in our lives we're dried up we're barren because we don't bear the image of Christ we're what we call so-called Christians Sunday morning worshippers brother Bram calls them Church Angels Road Angels home Angels Road devils fake we're fake we're fake right now how many wants to be a Christian let me see a show of hands tonight how many wants to be a Christian okay so then if you want to be a Christian it's been told to me by authorities that before they they had the days of the smelter brother Abraham you know what the smelter is right you worked in the smelter before yeah and they used to have one in Hurley okay so it's been told that the days before of the the smelter uh to take the dross out of the gold take the iron and the pyite the pyite is so close like the real gold it's called Fool's Gold it's fake it's fo's gold but the way they got all of that out now how many wants to be a Christian okay so the way that they got all that out that they beat it out with a hammer that's right have we changed our minds yet the Indians used to do that IND and the old Goldsmith used to do that beat it with a hammer turn it over and over and beat it until the DW was out of it the only way that they knew that it was down to the gold was when the beater could see his reflection in it the one who was beating could constantly look until he could almost shave by his own reflection of in the the gold that he was beating and when the holy spirit of God begins to beat on us with a gospel Hammer until all the things of the world is beaten out and we can reflect the image of the Lord God then I believe we become Christians for the word chrisan is to be Christlike to reflect him now that doesn't mean that we grow a beard right and so we saw that one time in uh Colombia right a man dressed like Jesus and everybody was like oh there's Jesus and and our pastor confronted the man next thing we know the man was at the altar I think he got baptized or all right so now how many Wants To Be In His Image now what kind of image was he he was acquainted with grief stricken with sorrow he was a great somebody he was a great somebody and he came as a servant he came not to be ministered to but to minister that's what makes him great now to be a Christian it says that he would beat it out with a hammer now as a as a testimony um I I most of you know that I I Str I suffered I I was uh probably back in about 2005 I guess I began to get a series of pains in my [Music] body right and it was in my in my back and and um you know you would get ridiculed right oh oh it can't be that bad take take a TI take a Tylenol and get pick yourself up you know uh but then uh it went on from 2005 2015 2019 and progressively getting worse and worse and worse and and then I began to wonder I I started thinking well you know I I I know I Lord I know you're a Healer I I know you're a you know I know that you can do these things but but why me and that that's what happens many times right we we see job we heard about job now job he was a man and and and and all because he was perfect all for the reason of being perfect job lost everything everything he lost it all can can you think of a man help me out can you think of a man that has gone through what job went [Music] through right some some of us here have gone through through through through distress we've lost family members parents have lost their children things we read about brother Bram the struggles that he went through we've seen it in the life of our pastor right but but job he lost everything and it says here that job he had seven sons and three daughters his substance also was 7,000 sheep and 3,000 camels and 500 Yol of oxen and 500 she asses and a very great household he lost everything right sometimes we say oh I lost a lot oh they took everything from me what did you have brother Dan I had 20 bucks they took it all right but job lost everything can you imagine the news if you read down in verse 13 and there was a day when his sons and his daughters were eating and drinking wine in their eldest brother's house and there came a messenger unto job and said The Oxen were plowing and the asses feeding beside them and the sabians fell upon them and took them away yay have slain they have slain all the servants with the edge of the sword I am the only one that escaped alone to tell thee right and then the next verse says and while that man was yet speaking another servant came and he said job all the camels are gone the calans came and took all the camels and while he was yet speaking another man comes and and says hey what wait they took all the all the all the ox and the Sheep the camels talk about getting some bad news all at once but job lost everything now we we we hear the story of job right and I'm sure that job like many of us he he probably began to wonder himself like that that's what we do about this time when when things start happening to us right when things start happening to us oh it's the wife fault right oh maybe I'm doing something wrong uh no I I know for sure it's the brother's fault he wasn't in church Wednesday he's the one making the whole thing fail man am I the only one who thinks like or am I the only one truthful right so no we begin to to to question those kind of things right but job we know that when he got all this news the Bible says that he rent his clothes and he worshiped God he said blessed be the name of the Lord the lord giveth and the lord taketh away blessed be his name how about taking that attitude you know uh when my son he he he had this uh he was born with this Venus malformation and and it's a a cluster of veins that doesn't develop right and then he got into this accident and and so when he was little actually he had fallen down and we took him to the doctor and they said no you know he's got a BL brain bleed and then they they told us well it's probably you could probably just leave it alone it's not going to grow it's just just you know it's just something that he has so then after he was older he got into a car accident and hit the windshield right on that spot so they took him to the do we took him to the hospital and uh they looked at it and they said well it's actually grown and it's bleeding now so we recommend that we you know take it out well though they ended up taking it out and about two three three four months later he had a seizure and I think those seizures I I think those impacted me more because you know I I I I I believed that the Lord was going to heal him but every time it would happen I I would get so angry I mean it would really I mean it would it would devastate me like like I was like I almost was like why God why why why why don't you kill him right and it and it used to like destroy my spirit and then all of a sudden because of my illness that I had I I was at the point of to where I was going to have to probably do disability in disability and so I I I I didn't know what to do I was I was in total stress distress they they took me to the hospital uh they injected my back and they said in five minutes you're going to be feeling real good Mr okay great 10 minutes later the doctor comes back by the room he says how do you feel said the same as when I walked in here oh let me give you two of these right here these are going to really put you they're going to take that pain out they gave me a shot of morphing they gave me two perets and then they after 20 minutes he said you got to be feeling real good Mr res how do you feel like the minute that I walked in here you can feel that said yes sir I can feel it he gave me another shot right and so I was like I was I was so stressed out I didn't know what my future was going to be I I didn't know if I was going to be able to work if I would get this ability if if if I didn't know uh from one day to the next how I was going to feel there was days that I couldn't even breathe I couldn't move my neck I couldn't I couldn't function and and and the devil was just right there I thought he was a Healer maybe he's not going to heal you though maybe and I would hear testimonies and the devil would come and say God's not real and I would fight back and I would say well the very fact that you're telling me he's not real tells me that he is because you wouldn't be real I was fighting back back and forth but let me tell you God did it God did it I can tell you today 100% I am healed I don't have a symptom I don't have the slightest symptom I've been about a year now where I don't even have a pain in my my back nothing God did it God is able let's time for us it's time for us to start speaking Jesus said if you say to this mountain be moved and don't doubt what you say now let me tell you that wasn't a man that said that that wasn't a preacher that said that that wasn't even brother Bram that said that that was God in flesh that said if you say and believe what you have asked for it shall be given unto you and why does he do that brother Bram says he gives us glimpses he gives us glimpses he us little glimpses but there is going to come trial there's going to come tribulation now after my back was healed my I've had sciatica for a long time that was bothering me now today I haven't had the pain since the day that I was it was called out I haven't had the pain right he gives us glimpses just like Elijah when he told the servant go out and tell me what you see he got a little Glimpse he said I see the cloud I see a cloud about the size of a man's hand that was just a little Glimpse and the prophet said oh I hear the sound of abundance of rain Glory of abundance of rain he gave me that little Glimpse in myself so that I would know that my son is healed 100% I believe that I believe it with it was a glimpse because what I had was going to take surgery it was going to take Sur surgery and I bet you I bet you if I went to the doctor tomorrow and I got an MRI I bet you that those MRI results would show a new spine you know why because God did it God did it God can do it he is [Applause] able and he gives us those glimpses to let us know whatever the trial but let me tell you the trials are going to come the trials will come and when you find yourself in those trials the prophet of God said it it it it has to be it it's after crucifixion after cruci ition Jesus had to go to the Cross so that he could be pressed so that he could be Crush so that the perfume in that flower could come out he had to be crushed bruised before the cross he he couldn't uh he couldn't say all power in heavens and earth is given unto me but brother Brown says that after crucifixion that he could stand and say all powers in Heaven and Earth are given unto me after the trial after the trial of our faith and what is it for it's to work patience in us it's to work patience now let me just read that to you now he is not talking about his faith now see he's talking about in the pergamus church age when he said I know your faith but he is commending them for their faithfulness and as he does also mention their patience now faithfulness and patience go together in fact patience is the outcome of faithfulness for it says in James 1:3 the trying of your faith worketh patience there is absolutely no other way in which to gain patience it has to come by trial or by faith Romans 511 tribulation work patience how highly God regards his out working of our patience it's seen in James 1:4 but let patience have her perfect work that you may be perfect you may be Christlike you can be an image of Christ as he said be therefore perfect even as I am perfect even as your father which is in heaven that may be perfect and entire lacking nothing God will God's will for us is perfection and that Perfection is patience it's time for us to take it back the prophet of God says that we have a right to go to Satan and tell him in his face we take it back that belongs to us that's mine that healing my health that's mine my child that's mine take it back it's time we take it back and we we we say many times in closing I I I want to be Christ like like amen amen how many would like to be like Paul right a minute everybody everybody wants to be like David everybody wants to be like Joshua everybody wants to be like Caleb how many here wants to be like Paul Paul said that when it pleased God separate me from my mother's womb and by called me by his grace to reveal himself in me to reflect himself through me how many wants to be like that right want to be like Paul everybody wants to be like Paul Paul said I I was shipwreck many times I was beaten 39 times 39 times five times I was spit upon I was in trouble on the sea I was in trouble in the wilderness I had problems everywhere I went when's the last time you have been punched in the face anybody here ever been testifying to somebody and they just punch you in the face have have you ever anybody have you ever gone up to somebody that that that that's living in sin and called out their sin and they punch you in the face and you take it no no no no no not us no right not us you punched me in the face buddy there's going to be some we're going to start throwing some hands here you're going to catch these hands right Paul says I was punched in the face I was beaten all for the glory of God and I did it I did it all for his glory and closing let's go over to First Corinthians chapter n and I'm going to start with verse 22 and as they have it up there I'm going to read it out of this version so you just follow along verse 22 I became weak to the weak to win the weak not us white we want to be strong don't tell me what to do I became weak to the weak to win the week I have adapted to the culture of every place I've gone so that I could more easily win people to Christ I've done all this so that I would become God's partner for the sake of the Gospel it is obvious it's obvious I'm going to prove to you that Paul wasn't what you think in your mind or what I think in my mind I I think of like you know an old man like Paul an old man you know I'm going to prove to you something different here it's obvious that all Runners on the racetrack keep on running to win but one receives the Victor's prize yet each one of you must run the race to be victorious a true athlete will be disciplined in every respect practicing constant self-control in order to win a laurel wreath that quickly Withers but we run our race to win a Victor's Crown that will last forever for the reason oh for that reason I don't run just to exercise how many you like to exercise well I'm not even going to look out in the audience Paul's saying right here I exercise but he says I don't just run just for exercise brother Enzo neither do I box Paul was a boxer Paul was a boxer he was a top level athlete he said neither do I box like one throwing punches to the wind we got a lot of Shadow boxers in here right we got a lot of Shadow boxers get in the mirror Paul says I don't do that I don't throw punches in the wind aimlessly I throw punches for a purpose but I train Like A Champion athlete I subdue my body and get it under control why does he do that he says I subdue my body like I'm disciplined I watch what I eat I watch what goes in I watch what goes out I watch what I say if you say Paul says I'm a champion athlete and I subdue myself in that under self-control I subdue my body and get it under my control so that after preaching the Good News to others that after oh they didn't put the scripture in the King James version it so after preaching the Good News to others I myself won't be [Applause] disqualified let me see real quick verse 27 but I keep my body I keep under my body and bring it into subjection lest that by any means when I have preached to others I myself should be a cast away right after preaching to others so that I myself will not be disqualified you want to be like Paul let's all stand to our feet images of [Applause] Christ images of Christ through Patience by the working of the patience in us I I I I think about how how it could be so easy for us oh it could be so easy when people gave their lives for this gospel the reason I can Preach Today is because a man gave his life a man gave his life and and not only did he he give his life it was crushed squeezed all the way until you want you want the best out of the juice you want the best juice out of the out of the fruit it all the way down to the end so let me tell you Brothers God is here God Is A Healer God will heal you but we're going to go through trials brother and Paul says I glory in my infirmities let's not forget that it's through the working of our patience that we believe on him tonight and it only teaches us to depend on him amen Hallelujah all [Music] together through it all oh through it all I've learned to trust in Jesus Jesus Oh I have
