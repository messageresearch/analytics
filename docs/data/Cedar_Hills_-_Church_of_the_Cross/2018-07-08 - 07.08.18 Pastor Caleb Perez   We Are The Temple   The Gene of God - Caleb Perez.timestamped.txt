[58:27] days oh what a what a pattern like a
[58:32] patron the unseen world el mundo I
[58:35] cannot sleep a they know that the the
[58:38] way that heavenly is arranged they know
[58:44] the way it's organized and structured
[58:46] any salary is true they also know the
[58:48] reason that they are around us is the
[58:50] main Canosa let us know Pakistan al
[58:52] because they've been told for Casillas
[58:54] decaying that we humans in a super
[58:57] honest woman are the Temple of the Holy
[58:59] Ghost almost as templo del espíritu say
[59:01] no they can't understand it yo que no la
[59:04] tienda because they look sometimes and
[59:06] they're like wow really well I'm being
[59:11] obedient do you think you stand here
[59:13] with them on hand but when they see is
[59:16] it Pross the process happens a little
[59:19] process and they sad and start to unfold
[59:21] in a human being yes the water makes
[59:25] everything they do worth it ok a
[59:29] Filipina
[59:31] let me get this because I get excited
[59:33] and I'm gonna go somewhere else and I

[59:46] kiss then also a little Celestia that is
[59:48] with us all the time
[59:49] it's that kind of so to see him but you
[59:50] see why we react sometimes good and
[59:52] sometimes bad doctor for a minute and I
[59:56] have you ever proud of yourself what
[59:59] does that mean oh so these days Lauri
[1:00:02] you know I I handle that pretty good to
[1:00:06] me right and we're riding high ah gross
[1:00:10] I'm within any mouth and then something
[1:00:12] else happens and man we're just total
[1:00:13] meltdown
[1:00:14] wha-hey but I'll go back analyze what
[1:00:18] happened this guy over here for the KS
[1:00:20] doctor because when we try to do good
[1:00:22] evils always present that was a Serbian
[1:00:25] in my list and we're like I guess I
[1:00:26] don't have what I thought I have you
[1:00:28] Louis who he was
[1:00:30] they get they let no man deceive himself
[1:00:32] is it can you noblest thing is so low

[1:00:37] yourself that you don't got nothing no
[1:00:38] more kissing a road knows about now you
[1:00:41] want an example of the Holy Ghost
[1:00:43] okay see now when we look at this condo

[1:00:49] inject himself into the human race
[1:00:51] certain us in controlling the Cancellara

[1:01:00] this probably the end o con esto I find
[1:01:02] in Allah do you think wintertime in
[1:01:05] Hoonah when I would do good
[1:01:06] Hakan drug will be an evil this present
[1:01:08] help me el mal Easter presented me

[1:01:43] you're way too serious right now
[1:01:45] and we seriously don't you what happens
[1:01:48] in the world okay pass huh
[1:01:50] here's paul I kissed her on low I
[1:01:53] delight in the law of God after the
[1:01:56] inward man I'm in verse 22 romans 7 22
[1:02:05] is a precursor canal interviewed
[1:02:07] methylate on a later use but I see
[1:02:09] another law in my members male miss me
[1:02:13] imploring against the law of my mind
[1:02:15] it's a bit like Hotel ELISA me and
[1:02:17] bringing me into captivity given County
[1:02:21] video to the law of sin which is in my
[1:02:24] members this end is near off all then
[1:02:27] Paul starts to cry out if this is part
[1:02:29] of this wretched man
[1:02:31] I shall deliver me from this body of
[1:02:36] death really realistic for this we
[1:02:38] believe we are the holy ghost
[1:02:40] because of us that is not the only thing
[1:02:43] that will deliver us from a body of
[1:02:45] death lodukku can ASSU anything either
[1:02:46] this was a very gene of God intended
[1:02:50] comes into the end when Aniyah don't
[1:02:53] breathe that you and there finds a
[1:02:54] dwelling place he went immortal and we
[1:02:57] no longer those days are governed by the
[1:03:00] outward others put along brakes know how
[1:03:03] we are governed by the inward orders
[1:03:05] from us Cornell's poorly hombre know
[1:03:07] what is saying is trying to keep us away
[1:03:09] from is it okay semester the Montoneros
[1:03:11] puede he wants you to question your
[1:03:13] identity because dick was stillness we
[1:03:16] then see that it comes to Jesus and he
[1:03:17] says to say thou be the Son of God and
[1:03:21] SEC - where is the liquid yours Jesus
[1:03:23] looks at him and says the Lord my God in
[1:03:27] your to the earth or take you to the
[1:03:29] temple I am the temple no choice will
[1:03:32] you change this into this I am the world
[1:03:35] I used to impugn Davida but he tried to
[1:03:39] make him question his identity doctor
[1:03:41] the question s we didn't do that because
[1:03:43] by doing so but Kippur the service they
[1:03:45] would have rejected the very jeans
[1:03:47] whatever is just so him from where he
[1:03:49] come from
[1:03:50] they love us believing come from God I
[1:03:52] go back to your seat well were they oh
[1:03:55] oh there's a pattern here huh but thrown
[1:03:58] intones I say find out the Tabernacle in
[1:04:01] the wilderness had three parts if their
[1:04:02] little jet rotini at rest party outer
[1:04:04] core
[1:04:05] elects to the only place lugar sent the
[1:04:07] Holy of Holies you know where Monsanto
[1:04:09] and a man brother Branham says in the
[1:04:11] message the Messiah
[1:04:12] you know Brady say a lemon Ronald my
[1:04:14] second miss yes a man is made up in the
[1:04:17] system of a tabernacle alone mr. calm
[1:04:20] question El Sistema
[1:04:21] they dealt a vermin in the outer courts
[1:04:24] no.6 Theriot then the holy place a lugar
[1:04:26] Santo and the holiest of Holies where
[1:04:28] Monsanto with the Shekinah glory on the
[1:04:31] inside
[1:04:32] don't like that Shekinah the veil veil
[1:04:35] Oh mmm that's the way were made
[1:04:38] is that como estamos con please look at
[1:04:40] each other they turn around look at your
[1:04:41] neighbor Paul tasty medias to Ramon or a
[1:04:43] neighbor hermano
[1:04:44] when I are made like this yo you stay
[1:04:46] still Malaysia we got a body
[1:04:48] then I must move quite outer core unless
[1:04:50] there are a spirit which is the holy
[1:04:51] place and a Mississippi to kiss look and
[1:04:53] we have a soul which is the Holy of
[1:04:55] Holies
[1:04:55] a landmark is look at my son I want you
[1:04:57] to notice the pattern here cuz if you
[1:04:59] can't help but throw on the framework
[1:05:01] that God uses for alarmism kill your son
[1:05:04] no cumbia
[1:05:05] come on now churchy he doesn't change it
[1:05:07] and gonna come B why are we looking to
[1:05:08] pattern ourselves after Hollywood but
[1:05:10] keep the gum was there I was cut more
[1:05:12] than listen
[1:05:12] oh yeah that why are we looking to
[1:05:14] pattern ourselves after someone else
[1:05:16] open their business this plays the alien
[1:05:19] don't deceive yourself nothing done in
[1:05:22] the mystery in your life that mysterious
[1:05:25] to be have to be unfolded they make
[1:05:27] yourself go oh when we look at this when
[1:05:32] de minimis yes don't forget that picture
[1:05:33] of the art of the the Tabernacle in the
[1:05:36] wilderness now those of you that know a
[1:05:40] little bit of about science because I
[1:05:43] know I don't know a lot about science
[1:05:44] Jonah say mucho but I do know one thing
[1:05:47] pero SI se una cosa is that when you
[1:05:49] look at that understand me de esto maybe
[1:05:51] it's not exactly the same shape he's
[1:05:54] understand it's like tomatoes la misma
[1:05:56] for what he saw in heaven it'll look at
[1:05:58] me Ronnie and Cielo he made in earth
[1:05:59] loosener athira
[1:06:00] in the tabernacle and what the
[1:06:03] tabernacle was located he brought it
[1:06:06] down and that's the way he created us
[1:06:08] there's a mano she's gonna suit rose
[1:06:10] outer core holy place holy of always
[1:06:12] next and if you want to go a step
[1:06:15] farther did you keep that impossible
[1:06:17] must say yeah the cells in our body are
[1:06:19] made that way to la statelessness to
[1:06:22] square posta means wanna see think about
[1:06:24] it means hello if you look at a cell
[1:06:26] she's kept unicellular that brazen altar
[1:06:29] it's got started everyone say everybody
[1:06:30] knows what inside the cell called a
[1:06:32] mitochondrion that's having cumin
[1:06:34] laminitis Allah but what is the
[1:06:36] mitochondrion du Carrousel Allah it
[1:06:41] burns and processes nutrients coming in
[1:06:45] to give the cells but a lot less they'll
[1:06:48] do the energy to do what it has to do
[1:06:50] line they're here looking at Sita said
[1:06:54] when they came in from the east with
[1:06:56] their sacrifice do we need unless taken
[1:06:58] sacrificios there was Levites there and
[1:07:01] they would take the sacrifice Itamar and
[1:07:03] secretary and everyone of the sacrifice
[1:07:05] whether it was a hologram serum or a
[1:07:09] lamb but whether whether it was flour or
[1:07:13] oil products a lot o friendís it bring
[1:07:18] it straight to the brazen altar you know
[1:07:22] what it does what they did on the brazen
[1:07:23] altar set me cares anything the
[1:07:25] mitochondrion does lo mismo que estas de
[1:07:28] la madre
[1:07:28] they burned it look another all the way
[1:07:32] to the most minut micro he has the same
[1:07:38] pattern Tina's mismo Pastrana Stella
[1:07:40] must mean the serpent had Maha Leicester
[1:07:45] fit that any amount of principles of
[1:07:47] life and yet principio de vida got into
[1:07:50] something and to understand he you be
[1:07:54] another batter he was up there it's all
[1:07:56] about that it is to piranhas now there
[1:07:59] are order how is it with human being
[1:08:01] always gone upstairs to my nose he
[1:08:03] finally found finds a way to inject
[1:08:05] himself I feel in control of injector
[1:08:06] still nervous woman now watch this now
[1:08:08] or the fix when you look at this cuando
[1:08:10] Mita as any other in and then this part
[1:08:13] will copy the nucleus and it's the part
[1:08:15] that is a nucleus but in the Holy of
[1:08:17] Holies which is in the nucleus is
[1:08:19] enormous and toy what is there yeah yeah
[1:08:22] the gene of God is that hinders the
[1:08:28] instruction nice truck yah hmm hold on a
[1:08:33] second I just crossed over
[1:08:35] grapes fell asleep okey to apenas crew
[1:08:38] say once again its mass in the nucleus
[1:08:43] in the nucleus
[1:08:45] what do we find in the Holy of Holies
[1:08:49] the Ark and Luger must not an LDR
[1:08:51] in allarakha there were things in it IV
[1:08:54] I'll toss you you you know what those
[1:08:56] things are but I want to get to this now
[1:08:58] it'll kill you that is in the nucleus of
[1:09:01] a cell and the nucleus do not stabilize
[1:09:03] the DNA of a person Estela persona
[1:09:07] praise God
[1:09:07] another cos in the
[1:09:09] holy of holies the gene of God and it's
[1:09:13] kind of rotated off of God look at he
[1:09:17] knows it is a light that came forth from
[1:09:19] the logo the logo is the pillar of fire
[1:09:23] comes down and sets in the holy of The
[1:09:27] Scindia this tiny little different and
[1:09:30] within us as Christians know I
[1:09:32] diferencia a nosotros como Christian
[1:09:34] what does this DNA contain can see ok
[1:09:36] coke it is there the area of biological
[1:09:38] instruction the sisters your lucky cat
[1:09:41] make each species unique component
[1:09:44] especially unique oh and these
[1:09:46] instructions yes the sister Chrystie
[1:09:48] only are passed from the parents to the
[1:09:50] offspring that's not bad de los pilotos
[1:09:52] man I scooped rolling and the only way
[1:09:54] can happen is a little more Catalan I
[1:09:56] wish I had some pictures to show you
[1:09:58] ok like Twitter your DNA is two strands
[1:10:01] and they're connected another innocent
[1:10:02] only it kind of spirals up like that but
[1:10:05] the only way that that when they are
[1:10:08] going to be copied cuando una cell
[1:10:10] copious they have to unwind didn't care
[1:10:13] central and let all the way to copy them
[1:10:14] is a little more come on cor pls watch
[1:10:17] this hold on a sec are you with me this
[1:10:24] this morning it's gotta unwind so it can
[1:10:28] be copied and in the DNA in a lot eme
[1:10:33] the instructions are there less than
[1:10:38] what is needed for the organism location
[1:10:41] is it apparel organism in this case
[1:10:43] would be we're talking about us enesta
[1:10:45] Castro nosotros
[1:10:46] it has the instructions analysis to be
[1:10:48] honest for our development but I
[1:10:50] understood this Arroyo our survival
[1:10:52] mister survey revealed and reproduction
[1:10:55] it reproduce human what's contained in
[1:10:58] there is look a continuing now think
[1:11:00] about this now or a pins and this atom
[1:11:02] in the beginning I then and it will have
[1:11:04] the instructions in the other sister
[1:11:05] Tunis but he forfeited his rights
[1:11:08] it'll confuse the richly forfeited the
[1:11:10] titled ebook a liberal there's an it
[1:11:12] shows that in there look estaba he what
[1:11:15] our inheritance based on this thread
[1:11:17] ends in there and there it tells us who
[1:11:19] we are
[1:11:19] no this gate can in a
[1:11:21] all of us where we come from those
[1:11:24] moisturizers what we're doing here where
[1:11:25] we're going get that Moses in DeLand if
[1:11:27] all these things are in that book
[1:11:29] consists of course assist on is the
[1:11:31] instruction book illiberal these two
[1:11:33] he's your orphans here look at here and
[1:11:35] it goes back to God regresses you where
[1:11:37] - I don't think back to the bosom they
[1:11:41] regress oho that yours come on
[1:11:46] there's a reason I say this is it's
[1:11:48] gotta go back to the bosom of where it
[1:11:50] came from
[1:11:51] Meera Krishna are you doing there yes
[1:11:52] Toledo because Jesus but all history
[1:11:55] brother branham I used to think that God
[1:11:58] was angry at me but Jesus loved me
[1:12:00] eliminar this your plan sister Sarah
[1:12:02] Cahill this was till I found out I used
[1:12:06] to think that God was angry in but jesus
[1:12:08] loves me mama
[1:12:10] till I found out esta camiseta limpa he
[1:12:13] is the very heart of God I stuck a meet
[1:12:16] with the venison rupees come from from
[1:12:18] the booth some people at that signal and
[1:12:20] therefore when Satan was ready to take
[1:12:22] the time goes back to where it came from
[1:12:34] biggest holiday we know in the bosom I
[1:12:37] missed it all
[1:12:38] that's why in his mind but his
[1:12:40] instrument the ice had already died for
[1:12:42] our sins a mile he already knew wants to
[1:12:46] make this idea but now in the bosom of
[1:12:49] the father wrote in his famous by the
[1:12:51] bus for now the knee cord is still there
[1:12:53] but yes now he turns there is a bunch of
[1:12:57] the time he loses it that's a typical
[1:12:59] also how others at I'm coming now watch
[1:13:02] now until book a DNA our souls or the
[1:13:05] Holies of Holies in lieu Eric Monsanto
[1:13:08] is the gene of God s intended use that's
[1:13:12] why he lost the very instruction Olivia
[1:13:16] personalized love you how to produce
[1:13:18] another son Cooper Lucille Auto he gave
[1:13:21] it up he lost where where's it at well
[1:13:24] this is contained in the genius is that
[1:13:25] Quentin II don't know him now he's human
[1:13:28] our I'll assume was always human but now
[1:13:30] that part of God the seed there is the
[1:13:32] purtiest has been relinquished now as
[1:13:35] tada then let's go let's see where this
[1:13:37] is taking us I'm sorry Rhonda no Java in
[1:13:39] that in those instructions and this does
[1:13:42] need to chew on this take it in the
