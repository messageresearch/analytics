[18:17] we're speaking on the waving of the
[18:19] Sheaf we are speaking upon the waving of
[18:23] the sheep
[18:26] and so I'd like to to to start off it
[18:30] might be a scripture that that you will
[18:33] not that you might not think it is
[18:35] appropriate but I think it is a most
[18:37] appropriate at this point
[18:43] in the book of Saint John chapter 12.
[18:48] and verse 32 is
[18:51] and the scripture says it like this
[18:56] and I pray we got about an hour and 15.
[19:02] we will Lark ourselves and lock and
[19:06] loaded into to this program
[19:09] and I don't know about you but this has
[19:12] been a lot of fun for me
[19:16] I think learn more more than than maybe
[19:20] you've learned but
[19:23] I sure appreciate them
[19:26] and uh the scripture tells us in Saint
[19:30] John 12 and verse 32.
[19:34] and if I be lifted up from the earth
[19:39] will draw all men unto me
[19:44] another translation is is this
[19:49] when I am lifted from the earth
[19:53] I will draw all men unto me
[19:57] we take away the if about it
[20:01] so this is the the waving of the chief
[20:06] offering
[20:09] and to start this brother brother
[20:11] brother Jacob go ahead and and give us a
[20:13] give us a start off yeah

[21:12] to be in your midst medius
[21:20] foreign
[21:26] according to what fish dictionary
[21:28] brother a question a dictionary Webster

[21:35] of the stocks

[23:04] having a conversation here absolutely
[23:06] absolutely you're gonna be part of the
[23:07] conversation with us man

[23:15] represents the blood of our Lord and
[23:17] Savior Jesus Christ
[23:23] this one does not have the roots
[23:27] and the chief
[23:30] now we go to the Book of Leviticus
[23:32] chapter 23 verse 10.
[23:37] write it down write it down Leviticus
[23:40] chapter 23 verse 10. yes
[23:50] and the word of God reads in this manner
[23:53] speak unto the children of Israel
[23:58] and say unto them
[24:01] when ye
[24:03] become into the land
[24:05] which I give unto you
[24:08] and shall reap the Harvest thereof
[24:17] then ye
[24:19] shall bring a Sheaf
[24:22] of the first fruits of your Harvest unto
[24:26] the priest yes
[24:42] the one they had to present is
[24:46] foreign
[25:22] because of their work that's right
[25:24] that's right and I was thinking foreign
[26:33] amen are we spiritual Israelites
[26:43] praise God so
[26:48] and I was also thinking
[26:53] sometimes the simple movements
[26:58] even when they had to pick up the
[27:01] showbread
[27:05] a simple motion a simple move is
[27:08] important
[27:11] he had to handle it with care conquidado
[27:15] not be careless and just no set of these
[27:18] no no no no you have to wave it no no oh
[27:23] before the Lord
[27:25] oh he had to wave it before the Lord
[27:29] and what is Pastor
[27:31] he's waving today yes
[27:40] [Applause]
[27:48] amen amen it's a delicate job absolutely
[27:54] amen praise God
[27:59] and we go to uh
[28:01] brother branham's message it is the
[28:03] rising of the Sun
[28:08] paragraphs 87
[28:11] mistaken he preached this message April
[28:13] of 1965 Easter Sunday and
[28:18] and
[28:21] the first day of the week first of the
[28:24] week April 1965.
[28:28] I was two months old
[28:32] and this man yes this Prophet yes
[28:37] wow 65 is a good year it's a good year
[28:41] that's right
[28:43] I was born in 65.
[28:47] yeah
[28:48] it's a very good year it's a very good
[28:51] year remember that it's a very good year
[28:55] praise God so we go to the rising of the
[28:58] sun almost the prophet
[29:00] Philadelphia
[29:03] program 87 and 88 days
[29:08] Jesus Christ
[29:13] amen he is the chief
[29:16] he is the first of the seed of those
[29:19] that slept waved on the first day
[29:23] the way the pre-made birthday of the
[29:25] week is
[29:30] Sunday Domingo you said you're gonna be
[29:33] part of the conversation we're waiting
[29:34] for the answer Sunday amen thank you the
[29:38] first day of the week primary
[29:41] amen glory be to God
[29:45] you're too serious look at somebody and
[29:48] say Sunday
[29:58] did you get that s-o-n-d-a-y Domingos
[30:08] to s o n a aliho right lift it up amen
[30:16] and praise God
[30:18] Jesus Christ
[30:21] the first of the seeds
[30:25] and the simple move of this of the
[30:27] street that was lifted up that the
[30:29] priest would lift up movement it was
[30:30] already simply it was a type knows about
[30:33] the types
[30:34] we know what a type is right
[31:01] praise God
[31:03] and if I be lifted up
[31:09] now we're gonna we're gonna take again
[31:12] the the word or the the word if out
[31:14] there and just just say it like this
[31:16] when I am lifted up
[31:20] all right
[31:22] this is sometimes the the
[31:25] characteristics of who do people in the
[31:29] message claim to be yes
[31:35] they would tell brother Branham that you
[31:37] that that he made too much of Jesus
[31:42] and brother Brandon would say I can't
[31:45] say enough about him
[31:49] and that's the same Quest that's the
[31:53] same thing that happens to us yes
[31:55] say too much about brother Branham
[32:00] no no no Jesus said Jesus
[32:06] I am lifted up
[32:18] and so when you come come into the the
[32:22] land as brother brother brother brother
[32:24] Jacob was telling us
[32:28] when you come into your land
[32:32] you come into what you're actually
[32:34] coming into is you're coming into your
[32:37] position
[32:41] that's why our pastor always he would
[32:45] tell us this is
[32:52] Lie by yourself
[32:54] but if you don't want to fly far because
[32:58] fly together
[33:01] that's the chief
[33:03] that's the stacking of the Gathering of
[33:06] the sheep
[33:08] it was that she was the quantity of
[33:11] stocks according to history how many
[33:15] stocks in each year
[33:18] this is this is the the numerology in
[33:22] scripture does not get lost
[33:26] there's there's seven Church ages
[33:28] there's seven messages
[33:31] there's all the numerology in God
[33:34] you cannot get away from it
[33:39] first day of the week only convocation
[33:43] that's the first day of the week
[33:46] but I want you to notice
[33:53] they would gather it in three
[33:57] all the way to eight
[34:00] and they would gather it in a way
[34:05] that would form a pyramid
[34:08] in order to be able to shelter the the
[34:12] the the grain from The rain
[34:17] that's why it's so important as our
[34:19] founding Pastor said foreign
[35:09] position that I have given unto you
[35:13] now you speak to the children of Israel
[35:17] that when you get to this certain place
[35:22] is the place
[35:24] God has chosen he lays his name there
[35:31] that name yeah
[35:34] Jesus when you get to this certain place
[35:37] that I promised you
[35:40] I take you when you get in there in this
[35:44] land
[35:46] it's a spiritual it's a natural land
[35:50] but the natural there is
[35:54] typifying the spirituals
[35:58] shall reap the Harvest
[36:02] you've never seen Harvest like what's
[36:05] happening right now
[36:09] doing in the continent of Africa
[36:13] wherever we have been able to go by
[36:16] God's grace
[36:22] is
[36:24] possession
[36:26] every every place
[36:29] and shall reap the Harvest thereof
[36:33] because
[36:34] then you shall bring a Sheaf
[36:38] of the first fruits of your Harvest unto
[36:41] the priests
[36:46] and he shall wave the Sheep before the
[36:49] Lord
[36:50] and you raise your hand
[36:52] move your hands
[37:16] that is the position
[37:19] this is why we tell we we must
[37:22] understand
[37:23] it's not just picking up some sheaves
[37:26] and waving it
[37:29] even though that is the natural
[37:32] but when he picks up your life
[37:37] yeah
[37:38] I was down I was without God or his son
[37:45] I don't know where you were at but he
[37:48] reached
[37:51] when I am lifted up
[37:54] I'll draw all men unto me
[37:57] that is the position is
[38:02] in the land that I have chosen to place
[38:06] my name there is
[38:14] tell us something about what God has
[38:17] told you
[38:20] so when I was looking into this I I
[38:23] began to I began to think about Peter
[38:28] how Satan desires to sift him as wheat
[38:34] look at this
[38:38] um so as we see as a wheat grows
[38:42] we see that it has a stock
[38:46] it has a tassel
[38:48] it has the shock
[38:50] and then it has the seed we see that
[38:54] that in here we we find the three stages
[38:57] of Grace
[39:00] we find how how the life
[39:04] how it comes up through the roots
[39:07] brother
[39:10] Ernie you'll know that this diagram came
[39:11] from the great Apostle brother Bernie
[39:13] Garcia is
[39:20] so we see how it goes through
[39:21] justification
[39:24] sanctification sanctification the
[39:27] baptism of the Holy Ghost
[39:29] but as as I began to read this
[39:33] you find that each piece of the Hui is
[39:37] so important
[39:39] because it gives nutrients to the seed
[39:43] as the seed is b as being pushed forward
[39:48] we see that as it comes and it Springs
[39:51] all the way to the top my name is
[39:54] seven leaves that have protected it the
[39:57] whole way through
[39:59] find seven Church ages seven Messengers
[40:03] but then it comes a time when all of a
[40:06] sudden it's called maturing time wow
[40:09] the first time happens and all of a
[40:12] sudden these please begin to fold away
[40:19] it doesn't mean that that seed is
[40:21] already ready mature
[40:24] but it shows that it's ripe it shows it
[40:29] shows that that it's a it's got a lot of
[40:32] moisture on it right now
[40:34] now it's got to get dried out a little
[40:36] bit
[40:37] and here's where we find this this story
[40:41] and and what shocked me about this you
[40:44] look at me is that Jesus is Jesus Jesus
[40:49] is saying in in Luke 22 31 again
[40:53] you know he never goes and and says
[41:02] he had already called him when he when
[41:06] when he called him to come and follow
[41:08] him
[41:09] he said your name will no longer become
[41:12] Simon it's going to be called Peter
[41:14] we all know that Peter means the rock
[41:17] we all understand that but Simon Simon
[41:22] Simon Simone means a reef significa
[41:26] a type of grass that is easily blown in
[41:30] the wind
[41:33] Peter
[41:35] I know your weakness
[41:38] your nature is that you can be blown
[41:41] away with anything
[41:44] but don't be afraid
[41:47] because I have prayed for these and a
[41:51] lot of times as individuals
[41:53] We Begin our spiritual walk with the
[41:56] Lord
[42:12] it takes a lot of things that you have
[42:15] to go through to build up to the
[42:16] maturity of where God needs you to be
[42:19] yeah
[42:22] we see that that that God his goals
[42:31] and we want comfort and we want
[42:33] blessings
[42:35] he wants to grow you and give you
[42:38] maturity
[42:40] so in this maturity stages
[42:43] all of a sudden Peter gets sifted
[42:46] through his doubt the repente Pedro he
[42:49] denies the Lord
[42:51] he begins to deny him he begins to do
[42:55] all these terrible things and yet and
[42:57] yet Peter is Walking with the Lord the
[42:59] whole time
[43:06] when Peter became mature
[43:10] that day was the day that you hear
[43:13] Brother Tommy speak about yes
[43:16] good up on the day of Pentecost
[43:19] and I want you to know that Pentecost
[43:21] one of the meetings is 50.
[43:24] it was the Year of Jubilee
[43:47] just preparing him for the day of his
[43:50] adoption
[43:54] and he says repent every one of you in
[43:58] the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and a
[44:01] powerful Mighty rushing wind came
[44:04] through
[44:04] and little licks of fire came from this
[44:09] big ball of fire

[47:35] and I

[48:00] Jesus thank you brother that that that's
[48:04] awesome
[48:05] you know it's it's uh
[48:09] when you when you when you hear Brother
[48:10] Branham on the on the on on on the
[48:14] position
[48:19] when you hear when you hear the prophet
[48:21] of God say this
[48:24] bless us now as we approach the word
[48:30] and father thou knowest the reason that
[48:33] I'm approaching the word
[48:39] from this very scripture here this is
[48:43] It's because that I feel that you want
[48:46] me to do it this way
[48:51] that it's your Divine will okay
[48:55] it's in your order is
[48:59] it's in it's in the it's the order of
[49:04] the day let's
[49:07] to let the people positionally foreign
[49:27] to you not long ago
[49:31] oh you have trained us so long Lord
[49:36] now father Our Father give us our ranks
[49:41] put us out there to what we're supposed
[49:44] to do
[49:47] so we can be about the father's business
[49:53] or we ask it in Jesus name thy son amen
[49:58] Jesus it is it is
[50:02] I I'm I'm I'm I'm listening to our
[50:05] pastor is
[50:09] and and what a message
[50:13] the series that he started with where do
[50:15] I where do you stand
[50:20] when he spoke on the week before of of
[50:24] maturity brother Jacob
[50:28] I found out I found myself
[50:32] and he said do you do this do you do
[50:34] that do you do this is
[50:38] I I failed in almost every box
[50:44] failing failing failure
[50:51] and a person says Where Do We Go From
[50:54] Here
[50:57] well sometimes if you're at the bottom
[51:00] I'm gonna visit you
[51:02] the only way to go is
[51:08] but I felt the responsibility
[51:13] because it is the challenge of the hour
[51:17] it's not even the challenge of the day
[51:19] no more
[51:20] it is the challenge of the hours
[51:23] and when I found myself that I was weak
[51:27] in all these areas
[51:32] did God want me to do
[51:36] he wanted me to go and challenge be
[51:39] challenged
[51:43] to go and to know what the next step is
[51:48] when you go under justification
[51:50] sanctification crucification
[51:53] scientification and you stopped there
[51:55] you said that sheath cannot be waived
[51:58] it's a it's a second
[52:00] because you've stopped it cannot be
[52:04] waved over
[52:06] when you come and under under the
[52:09] baptism of the Holy Ghost
[52:12] and these three processes produces a new
[52:15] birth
[52:18] things got to happen
[52:21] we know by the message of the hours
[52:38] the next step is add to your faith
[52:41] virtue is
[52:43] we know what to do
[52:47] we know what's required of us
[52:51] that's why that's why when when Paul
[52:53] comes to the upper coast of Ephesus
[52:55] foreign
[52:56] [Music]
[53:47] foreign
[54:18] in the local church in La Iglesia local
[54:22] let's go back to Leviticus 23. uh
[54:27] verse 10.
[54:31] I want you to notice four or five things
[54:33] here okay
[54:35] and all you young men that have your
[54:37] notebooks
[54:39] [Music]
[54:44] you know what you know what that means
[54:45] every time you say it in the scriptures
[54:46] significant
[54:50] time the empo is
[54:55] the time that's right wow means
[54:59] the message will even teach you how to
[55:02] read your Bible
[55:04] we've said all these things and now we
[55:07] want to break it down all the way to you
[55:10] how does this relate
[55:14] first thing he wasn't gonna write
[55:17] nothing to the children of Israel
[55:20] he was going to speak unto the children
[55:26] notice that it was a spoken word
[55:29] it wasn't a written word
[55:32] but then that spoken word that was
[55:35] spoken
[55:37] would be written
[55:40] now the question is
[55:42] or is it being written
[55:49] anybody wanna the young people where is
[55:51] he writing that word that was spoken
[55:54] again
[55:59] put your hand on your heart
[56:02] he's writing it inside of you because
[56:07] we already heard about coming to the
[56:10] land that I will give you in Toronto
[56:13] but I'm going to bring that down to the
[56:16] individual
[56:17] [Applause]
[56:18] remember we already know but God had a
[56:21] place he chose to put his name right yes
[56:26] but you see so many vagabonds here's the
[56:29] expression the way I'm gonna say it
[56:37] among the message
[56:39] and I'm not throwing it nobody
[56:42] people simply don't know where their
[56:48] place is in the body
[56:55] I said it that way for a reason
[56:59] so first of all don't even think about a
[57:02] harvest
[57:04] until you come to the place that God has
[57:08] put you in
[57:09] and that brings you to the place where
[57:12] God has put you under the care of a
[57:16] Ministry
[57:20] that is
[57:24] now I want to clarify does that mean
[57:27] everybody has to be in one place
[57:31] I'm not saying that
[57:34] do not misunderstand
[57:37] god brother Ernie God placed you where
[57:40] he wanted you
[57:43] but he placed me he placed you where he
[57:47] till you come to that place
[57:50] that's the only time you're gonna ever
[57:53] find out what your rank is
[57:58] what you your particular job is in the
[58:02] body is
[58:06] and shall reap the Harvest thereof
[58:11] it's the verse 10 again we went from the
[58:13] land that I will give you and shall reap
[58:16] the Harvest he said
[58:19] he spoke to them
[58:22] there was a Karma
[58:24] time goes by
[58:26] in that time he takes him to the land
[58:29] where they're supposed to be
[58:31] there
[58:33] and now there's a conjunction
[58:36] that's gonna connect these two things
[58:39] together
[58:44] shall reap the Harvest thereofs against
[58:47] sumis
[58:48] and we just heard how are you going to
[58:50] reap a harvest
[58:53] if you don't show the seeds
[58:56] if you don't go through the process of
[58:59] what the wheat represents
[59:03] then how are you gonna
[59:06] add the Harvest
[59:13] Harvest
[59:16] time's going by you're growing
[59:20] don't shall you bring a sheath right yes
[59:24] of the first fruits
[59:28] now before I go into the first fruits
[59:31] just a little bit plenty of time we've
[59:33] only been going 45 minutes
[59:39] I have a bad habit of doing that
[59:43] no no that's a bad confession I used to
[59:46] have a bad habit of doing it
[59:48] but I want you to notice them foreign
[1:00:14] [Music]
[1:00:21] has to be the whole thing
[1:00:24] that's right that's right
[1:00:27] amen amen so without the waving of the
[1:00:30] sheath we've worked we've just heard
[1:00:33] there is no to Pentecost
[1:00:36] Desperado and that's another problem in
[1:00:39] the message
[1:00:40] people preaching to go
[1:00:46] Pentecost when brother says that we are
[1:00:51] no longer in the dispensation of the
[1:00:54] outpouring of the Holy Spirit
[1:00:59] we are in the dispensation of adoptions
[1:01:09] say that again please don't hold that
[1:01:12] again yeah well well whatever you want
[1:01:14] yeah no longer the outpouring of the
[1:01:17] Holy Spirit upon All Flesh
[1:01:23] this guy right here
[1:01:26] but the infilling of the Holy Spirit
[1:01:29] but here's the problem why people can't
[1:01:32] really totally receive the end feeling
[1:01:34] of the holy spirit
[1:01:39] this doesn't come upon you no being
[1:01:42] all the time
[1:01:44] by itself
[1:01:46] it takes a vessel
[1:01:50] someone there
[1:01:51] just say this one has water and this one
[1:01:54] does
[1:01:57] pouring into another
[1:02:03] and we don't want to go into that our
[1:02:05] pastors
[1:02:07] it's coming from one vessel to the other
[1:02:12] and that's the part
[1:02:14] sometimes we can't swallow is
[1:02:17] okay
[1:02:19] got all these commas here in the time
[1:02:23] going back and then you've got to bring
[1:02:28] now notice we we heard how they we're
[1:02:33] planting the wheat
[1:02:36] every day they they were taking care of
[1:02:39] that that quick
[1:02:41] they were cultivating that question
[1:02:45] they were watering it every day
[1:02:47] that was their main focus
[1:02:51] that's what was most important to them
[1:02:56] so when their product funny came forth
[1:02:59] through all those stages
[1:03:04] and they put that quick out of the
[1:03:07] ground is
[1:03:13] Noah Noah did they know what they have
[1:03:21] did they know
[1:03:23] what they had location
[1:03:26] account here's the problem with us
[1:03:30] I'm going to pluck up some weight and
[1:03:32] I'm going to take it
[1:03:34] and we only have the priest wave it
[1:03:38] let's bring it down
[1:03:40] I'm gonna bring it to the pastor
[1:03:45] see and maybe just maybe accepted
[1:03:56] verse 11 versions
[1:03:59] and he shall wave the Sheep before the
[1:04:01] Lord to be accepted for you
[1:04:08] what does that mean to you
[1:04:14] our mentality mostly reads that and says
[1:04:20] he shall wear the Sheep before the Lord
[1:04:24] so we will be accepted
[1:04:27] that's the way we think is
[1:04:32] rising of the Sun in
[1:04:36] yes a little sold paragraph 84.
[1:04:43] the chief
[1:04:45] which was the first of your seed wow
[1:04:54] not the leftovers
[1:04:57] not everybody's picked it up and touched
[1:05:00] it
[1:05:03] back at the supermarket and I don't even
[1:05:06] want to go and do the other things
[1:05:08] thank you the first of your seed that
[1:05:12] you planted
[1:05:15] he's bringing it down to to us as
[1:05:18] individuals
[1:05:23] and when it comes up
[1:05:26] when it comes up and is ripened
[1:05:31] and you cut down the Sheep
[1:05:36] so if you don't know what you're doing
[1:05:39] you're gonna cut it down at the wrong
[1:05:41] time
[1:05:43] the product is mature
[1:05:49] you cut it down and take it to the
[1:05:51] priest
[1:05:56] how many of us do that
[1:05:59] well I think the pastor should do
[1:06:02] everything
[1:06:05] it's the pastor in the ministry
[1:06:08] it's always about what somebody else can
[1:06:11] do for me
[1:06:14] this person that's maturing
[1:06:17] he's not waiting for nobody to do this
[1:06:22] he's gonna do it because he's gone
[1:06:27] through the process to produce
[1:06:33] he's not guessing I hope and I I hope I
[1:06:37] make watch this
[1:06:39] and let him take it and wave it before
[1:06:42] the Lord
[1:06:45] for your exception
[1:06:49] now notice how it said in Spanish that
[1:06:51] you might be accepted
[1:06:54] foreign
[1:07:01] for your exception
[1:07:04] that you are accepted
[1:07:10] you have come with your Chief
[1:07:13] and he is to wave it before the Lord
[1:07:20] wow no wonder he can binds
[1:07:25] Keep Together
[1:07:28] under the revelation of the blood
[1:07:31] Revelation and brother Brandon said in
[1:07:34] the seals
[1:07:35] I've got about five more minutes
[1:07:40] there's two groups of people that claim
[1:07:43] to be under the blood
[1:07:48] of them
[1:07:53] rejects the revelation of the blood
[1:07:57] Revelation and how do they do that where
[1:08:00] did that blood come from
[1:08:02] it came out of the spirits
[1:08:06] that came out of the word
[1:08:09] you get that
[1:08:11] is no longer the chemistry of the blood
[1:08:13] yeah
[1:08:15] spirit that came out of it
[1:08:18] but where did that blood come from
[1:08:21] came out of the word made flesh
[1:08:24] so when that Spirit of the blood is
[1:08:31] revealed to you
[1:08:34] now you can bind your sheep together
[1:08:40] why this is this is good stuff to me
[1:08:47] you then are downstairs have to bring
[1:08:51] your Chief
[1:08:54] as you grow in the Lord
[1:08:58] are you understanding
[1:09:00] so it's no longer I'm going to bring
[1:09:02] this to see if I'm accepted yes
[1:09:08] how in the world would this person have
[1:09:10] a sheep with
[1:09:11] the whole process and the wheat is
[1:09:20] the original crane
[1:09:23] original I've even heard ministers say
[1:09:26] is
[1:09:27] we all go through stages
[1:09:31] there's things that I say now that I
[1:09:33] didn't say many years ago
[1:09:35] [Music]
[1:09:37] God has a way of changing your your tune
[1:09:44] he knows how to deal with us
[1:09:48] thank God
[1:09:51] he didn't leave it up to just to us no
[1:09:53] no kill one another right
[1:10:00] I've heard Minister say why you know
[1:10:02] brother Benham wanted to be bride is
[1:10:05] could tell the series
[1:10:08] and they'll bring out these quotes
[1:10:13] well God's gonna have a church
[1:10:16] and I hope I'm with her
[1:10:19] and they say you see he didn't really
[1:10:21] know he was bride
[1:10:24] and I just scratch my head yo hello
[1:10:29] do you think brother Bennett could skip
[1:10:32] this
[1:10:34] processes didn't he have to go through
[1:10:37] the same process of the new birth
[1:10:41] growing to the adoption
[1:10:44] when he goes to cff Bosworth on his
[1:10:47] deathbed FF password and he falls at his
[1:10:51] feet and says my father my father
[1:10:54] me padre
[1:10:56] Israel
[1:11:04] he said whatever was an apostle to the
[1:11:07] Pentecostals
[1:11:09] that's right
[1:11:13] he didn't just look to see Apostles in
[1:11:15] the Bible wherever uh
[1:11:18] he had a personal one right there with
[1:11:21] him
[1:11:22] he recognized
[1:11:25] amen amen
[1:11:29] so what stage did Brother Brennan
[1:11:32] think that he was seat and get it
[1:11:37] that he knew he was elected
[1:11:41] when the spirit of Elijah
[1:11:45] had turned his heart
[1:11:50] to the original Faith Apostolic
[1:11:56] before God could use him to turn the
[1:11:59] hearts of the children to the fathers
[1:12:05] his heart
[1:12:13] um
[1:12:21] here's about Transfiguration
[1:12:24] and those angels came down and he was
[1:12:28] lifted up into the constellation
[1:12:32] this is my beloved Prophet is
[1:12:40] and we could keep going
[1:12:42] so now you've got to take this
[1:12:45] it's great get these notes foreign
[1:12:57] oh
[1:13:01] I said oh yeah you're not gonna like it
[1:13:04] it's gonna be so sweet to your mouth
[1:13:07] but it's gonna be so bitter
[1:13:11] kicking all the hybrid garbage
[1:13:18] and that don't feel good
[1:13:22] that's a super bitter experience is
[1:13:27] stupid I might just stop right there
[1:13:29] because my time is up
[1:13:36] that was awesome
[1:13:37] [Applause]
[1:13:41] that was tell us a little bit more we
[1:13:43] got about 15 minutes you just deal with
[1:13:46] us about 15 more minutes
[1:13:48] and our craziness up here
[1:13:54] so God so then God thinks enough of us
[1:13:57] that we're strong enough
[1:14:01] we can pass any test that that the devil
[1:14:05] will throw at us
[1:14:11] I began to think all that the wheat has
[1:14:14] to go through
[1:14:16] and it goes through good times
[1:14:18] it goes through bad times but the one
[1:14:22] thing that was always for sure
[1:14:24] what a new season was coming every time
[1:14:30] and in this we see we see this
[1:14:33] that it had to die
[1:14:36] to give life and how much more had
[1:14:40] Christ gave his own life
[1:14:45] have life today
[1:14:47] it should be something that that should
[1:14:50] stir all of us up ever even more every
[1:14:52] day
[1:14:56] to know that we are now carriers of that
[1:14:59] same life
[1:15:02] and for this Dying World to receive more
[1:15:05] of Christ
[1:15:06] [Music]
[1:15:08] it takes us not just to hold it into
[1:15:10] ourselves
[1:15:13] it takes us to go to a
[1:15:16] Persona that maybe don't have the same
[1:15:20] opportunity that we have
[1:15:23] and be able to give them life
[1:15:26] that's what Christ did for me okay
[1:15:30] that that was something that was so
[1:15:32] amazing for me with within this study
[1:15:34] okay
[1:15:37] in order to get life
[1:15:40] you had to give your life and it isn't
[1:15:43] easy you know it's possible but it is so
[1:15:46] worth it
[1:15:48] one of the one of the other things that
[1:15:50] I that I had
[1:15:54] simply looking and me and my dad were
[1:15:57] talking about it you see it here
[1:16:02] in order to come into mature
[1:16:05] see how they had to be stacked together
[1:16:08] you know it's it's like it's like after
[1:16:12] a while me as a third generation
[1:16:15] I know there's a lot of people online
[1:16:17] you you get tired
[1:16:21] of hearing oh it was brother Bernie's
[1:16:24] Ministry and the brother Tommy's music
[1:16:28] and then everybody tried to make it like
[1:16:30] we were all separate
[1:16:34] we're all tied together now we've all
[1:16:37] ripened together
[1:16:38] today we're all going home together
[1:16:42] there's their Ministry and this is
[1:16:50] body of the Lord Jesus Christ and one
[1:16:53] day you idea we'll all be together on
[1:16:56] the other side
[1:16:59] praise God
[1:17:00] [Applause]
[1:17:02] good point brother man when they stacked
[1:17:05] him in the in the field and Los Campos
[1:17:08] they would stand them up right
[1:17:11] to avoid rodents
[1:17:20] and they were facing upwards not to the
[1:17:24] sun

[1:18:42] that was coming up to develop in the who
[1:18:46] is
[1:18:50] but when it came time for the Harvest
[1:18:54] [Music]
[1:18:57] all the life had to be in the grain
[1:19:03] when the combine would come
[1:19:05] down here
[1:19:07] to harvest the wheat
[1:19:10] and brother Benham says

[1:19:30] presence of the s-o-n
