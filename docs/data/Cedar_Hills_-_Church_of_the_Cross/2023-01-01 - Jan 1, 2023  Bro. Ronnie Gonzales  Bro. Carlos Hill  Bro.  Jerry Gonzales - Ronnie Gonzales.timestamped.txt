[37:09] again
[37:12] well
[37:15] we got to start with the script here of
[37:17] the theme of the year right
[37:21] the day I died is the theme of the year
[37:23] that's what our pastor our pastor put
[37:25] into place
[37:34] First Corinthians 15 30.
[37:40] and why stand we in Jeopardy every hour
[37:47] I approach I protest by your rejoicing
[37:50] which I have in Christ Jesus our lord
[37:58] I Die daily
[38:02] amen you may be seated
[38:04] as you're being seated let's turn into
[38:06] one more scripture
[38:10] let's turn to John 5 24 and
[38:15] cuatro
[38:17] verily verily I say unto you
[38:19] either heareth my word and believeth on
[38:22] him that sent me hath everlasting life
[38:25] and shall not come into condemnation but
[38:29] is passed from death
[38:32] unto life
[38:46] a little bit on the day that the day I
[38:49] died
[38:50] [Music]
[38:52] you know what I I can't help but go back
[38:55] and give a little bit of a testimony
[38:59] you know and first of all it starts with
[39:02] a with it started with a Godly mother
[39:06] you know and as a young man as a young
[39:08] child
[39:10] seeing my mom reading the books hearing
[39:13] the tapes hearing the voice of the
[39:15] Prophet
[39:17] losses
[39:19] you know and that makes an impact on you
[39:22] yes
[39:24] you know as a child you know you don't
[39:27] realize it
[39:30] and uh you know but it makes that impact
[39:32] on you later in life
[39:36] you know and and uh you know as you know
[39:39] I remember as a little boy whenever I
[39:41] would get sick
[39:43] you know I never stayed there you know
[39:45] watching TV you know under the blankets
[39:51] since that made an impact on me I would
[39:54] turn on a message
[39:58] because in hearing what the tapes that
[40:02] were being played as Cucina La sientas
[40:05] I knew that there was healing through
[40:07] that voice
[40:09] I'm sorry you know I and you know when I
[40:12] was getting this ready I was just like
[40:14] super super emotional
[40:18] emotional you know you can't help but be
[40:21] to see what God has done in your life
[40:22] you know
[40:27] it just you want you love the Lord so
[40:30] much
[40:32] you know and seeing that as a child I I
[40:35] I remember hearing the voice
[40:39] and I remember that when I was sick I
[40:42] would also want to hear the voice
[40:46] because that was that is the void not
[40:49] knowing if that as a child
[40:51] but as an adult you understand that that
[40:54] was the voice of God to us in these last
[40:56] days
[41:00] you know so it's kind of started there
[41:02] in pesos
[41:04] we don't have a whole lot of time so
[41:06] none of you elaborate too much
[41:09] I prepared for 10 minutes and uh they
[41:12] gave me 20. so like yeah
[41:15] you know and and I remember there as a
[41:18] child growing up and hearing these words
[41:22] and it took me to the City of Phoenix
[41:27] you know and and the City of Phoenix in
[41:29] Las Vegas after after the after these uh
[41:32] the services there uh the the meetings
[41:34] there in Phoenix
[41:37] I remember me and my brother were coming
[41:40] out of the tent they're in Phoenix
[41:45] I don't know for those who were you know
[41:47] who we went they used to have a tent by
[41:48] the church
[41:50] you know and I remember being Jerry my
[41:53] brother were walking out of the tent
[41:57] and all I remember is hey come here
[42:00] foreign
[43:24] hey you want to go to lunch
[43:26] heck yeah let's go vamos you know so
[43:30] every I remember this for for years
[43:32] years and years this went on
[43:35] you know and and and having this
[43:38] experience
[43:39] I was I remember that that under the
[43:43] council
[43:45] I remember that under the instructions
[43:49] but I understood that I had access to
[43:52] Christ
[43:54] not a Christ of yesterday
[43:56] I don't want the crisis of 2022.
[44:00] and what the Christ of today
[44:05] and I understood by the council that I
[44:08] had access
[44:11] that I would have that I would I would
[44:13] have to I would have to die to myself
[44:17] not a partial death
[44:22] you know I and and in this Council
[44:27] that I heard I I remember hearing the
[44:31] tapes yes
[44:33] and and the tapes was a confirmation of
[44:36] what was being told to me
[44:38] it wasn't just some hearsay
[44:43] no no but I could I could punctuate both
[44:46] with an amen
[45:00] it was the voice of God
[45:03] the Earth and that the voice of God did
[45:05] not die when the man was buried yes
[45:11] and I was here with the exact same voice
[45:16] and still hearing that same voice
[45:20] the only thing that changed was the
[45:21] vessel
[45:22] but the voice is still the same
[45:28] and from that time there is and from
[45:32] that time
[45:33] and from that time
[45:35] I made a choice
[45:39] when family would turn their backs
[45:43] they would be ridiculed
[45:46] yeah they still made a choice to to
[45:49] follow the voice of the Lord foreign
[46:10] he says I was with the Hebrew children
[46:13] in the fiery furnace
[46:17] when the fire couldn't burn them because
[46:20] of the presence of the fourth
[46:24] Manos
[46:26] I was with Daniel in the parami
[46:58] first uh paragraph 100
[47:00] I I was I was most surely with him at
[47:04] Calvary
[47:07] you want to know the day that I died
[47:10] and recognize
[47:13] right here I must be identified with him
[47:17] at Calvary
[47:20] I must be I must be there to a place
[47:24] that's where
[47:26] that we're not also I was identified
[47:28] with him at Calvary
[47:30] identity
[47:33] I dealt with him at Calvary
[47:36] Christian must die with him at Calvary
[47:39] Christian
[47:41] if you don't drive with him at Calvary
[47:44] you could be none of his
[47:47] I was there when he died
[47:50] I died with him
[47:53] how many could say that this morning
[48:00] and then I was with him when he raised
[48:02] from the dead
[48:04] los Muertos
[48:14] I come up on Easter morning with him
[48:17] here is the Paradox
[48:24] in eastern morning with him in the
[48:26] resurrection
[48:29] whatever he did I was right there
[48:34] how many believers

[50:21] something that's incredible
[50:26] that's a paradox that's something that's
[50:29] almost completely
[50:33] it couldn't be so
[50:36] but yet
[50:39] that same voice travel through the
[50:42] eternities
[50:47] has come to Immortal beings
[50:51] that's what First Corinthians says

[54:38] of God
[54:43] amen God bless you amen
[54:45] [Applause]
[54:58] God blessed
[55:02] man I I'm reminded
[55:06] let's listen to brother Ronnie I'm
[55:08] reminded of of a story in the Bible
[55:13] and and brother Ronnie wrote a quote uh
[55:17] of the the three the three young men the
[55:19] three men that were there the Hebrew
[55:21] children
[55:25] and you know those those three Hebrew
[55:27] children
[55:29] they they found themselves in a
[55:32] situation
[55:34] and their situation was that of a
[55:37] desperation
[55:39] you see because a lot of people think
[55:42] that the three Hebrew children
[55:45] that they were just some young kids that
[55:48] were just kind of didn't know too much
[55:53] maybe they had a little bit of Faith
[55:56] but but I want you to understand
[55:59] that these three Hebrew children
[56:03] they were Scholars
[56:05] foreign
[56:25] that there was a desired result
[56:31] they knew that there was something
[56:33] coming
[56:36] but they reached a point in their life
[56:40] where they were so desperate
[56:44] they just had to see
[56:49] they just had to get to the point
[56:54] where all that they had heard of in the
[56:57] Bible
[56:59] could be made manifest to them
[57:03] they need needed it so bad
[57:08] they wanted it so bad
[57:11] that they began to ponder hey
[57:16] so one day
[57:18] King Nebuchadnezzar is
[57:21] after all the things that Daniel had
[57:24] done the spirit told us
[57:26] he builds a statue to Daniel
[57:31] because Nebuchadnezzar thought that
[57:34] Daniel was the God
[57:38] but when he did he built it out of pure
[57:41] gold
[57:43] and and as he as he does this and makes
[57:46] this construction
[57:49] we know the story he makes the decree is
[57:54] and he says you got to worship
[57:58] and and when when that happens
[58:01] all these three young men
[58:05] they said wait a minute we're starting
[58:07] to see something here
[58:11] I see an opportunity here
[58:15] I see something a picture starting to
[58:19] developed
[58:22] we might be able to
[58:27] create a situation
[58:30] in which
[58:32] the desired result
[58:35] could be manifested
[58:38] and so we know
[58:40] let's let's go to the scripture real
[58:43] quick
[58:44] Daniel chapter 3 and verse 19.
[58:48] and we've read this a bunch of times
[58:52] and it says then was Nebuchadnezzar full
[58:55] of Fury
[58:57] oh in the form of his Visage was his
[59:00] visit was was changed against Shadrach
[59:03] Meshach and Abednego you said
[59:11] and commanded that they should heat the
[59:14] furnace
[59:17] one seven times more
[59:21] and we know the story is
[59:24] but I want you to notice something
[59:27] the furnace that they were eating is
[59:33] it was a furnace to process gold
[59:38] they were building the golden image
[59:43] they needed to melt the gold
[59:47] the Lord had the furnace sitting right
[59:49] bye
[59:51] brother Jim I had to go look it up
[59:55] at what temperature does gold melted
[1:00:03] 1948 degrees
[1:00:07] and that was great yes
[1:00:11] 1948 degrees
[1:00:15] was enough to produce deity
[1:00:19] but I want you to know
[1:00:22] for those people
[1:00:25] just deity wasn't enough
[1:00:29] they needed something more
[1:00:32] they wanted something more
[1:00:35] they wanted to see that manifested
[1:00:40] so if you do the simple math
[1:00:44] and you multiply 1948 times 7.
[1:00:51] you arrive at a spectacular number
[1:00:55] spectacular thirteen thousand decimal
[1:01:00] 646 degrees
[1:01:03] that's the temperature that the furnace
[1:01:06] was heated to it is
[1:01:13] I started that I started to try to see
[1:01:16] the story unfold
[1:01:17] is
[1:01:20] and as I see Nebuchadnezzar
[1:01:24] and he brings these three young men in
[1:01:27] front of him
[1:01:29] you see these young men understood who
[1:01:32] they were dealing with
[1:01:35] they knew Nebuchadnezzar was a very
[1:01:38] cranky individual
[1:01:41] so the first time that he asked them
[1:01:45] he said will you bow usted
[1:01:50] they didn't timidly respond to him
[1:01:54] they didn't stand there saying no no we
[1:01:56] won't bow no no no no no no no
[1:01:59] sir no Senor they had a desired result
[1:02:04] foreign
[1:02:36] so here comes Nebuchadnezzar again I'll
[1:02:38] give it a number will you now bow
[1:02:42] and they turn back to him again
[1:02:45] I said we will not bows
[1:02:50] six times harder
[1:02:54] and by this time you could hear it feel
[1:02:58] the heat coming from the oven
[1:03:02] they were watching as men who stood
[1:03:04] around tending the furnace is
[1:03:24] just defrosting what was inside of us
[1:03:29] started to melt what was inside
[1:03:47] [Music]
[1:04:33] and when Elijah sent him
[1:05:12] and then they had studied when Joshua
[1:05:15] was encamped around that that city of
[1:05:17] Jericho is
[1:05:21] studied the strategy of going around the
[1:05:24] city is
[1:05:31] that when they blew the horns
[1:05:35] that desired result had been produced
[1:05:41] and they said to one another
[1:05:44] we've got to reproduce the animals can
[1:05:48] reproduce the same exact situation and
[1:05:51] this is my situation we've got to create
[1:05:53] something
[1:05:54] where that can be produced
[1:05:58] we need the seven times
[1:06:02] and when Nebuchadnezzar said
[1:06:06] seven times harder yet this is 13
[1:06:24] 000 degrees
[1:06:27] at 13 000 degrees
[1:06:30] is where the core of the earth is
[1:06:35] the core of the Earth runs at 13
[1:06:39] 000 degrees
[1:06:53] whatever I get burned
[1:06:56] to take the Stony heart
[1:07:00] and to change it 13
[1:07:05] 000 degrees
[1:07:07] nothing else would do for them 13
[1:07:15] 000 degrees
[1:07:16] something else would happen
[1:07:20] the basic elements of nature
[1:07:25] would begin to break down in such a way
[1:07:31] that it would open up a portal
[1:07:36] and as they walked into the furnace
[1:07:40] all the men around them dropping Dead
[1:07:42] from the heat
[1:07:45] they walked in it was and you can hear
[1:07:50] God tell wormwood
[1:07:55] wormwood can't remember the name one
[1:07:57] month says let me go down there
[1:08:00] and God says
[1:08:02] oh no no wormwood no uh
[1:08:07] this is a big man's job
[1:08:11] and he looks and he says North
[1:08:16] Windsor East and West Winds come with me
[1:08:22] because my children
[1:08:24] have created a situation
[1:08:28] in which I can be made manifest
[1:08:33] so I gotta go down there
[1:08:36] and what happened
[1:08:38] they walked into the fiery furnace
[1:08:42] and lo and behold
[1:08:45] even Nebuchadnezzar
[1:08:48] looked at the furnace and the flames
[1:08:52] and he said I see one standing
[1:08:57] as it were the Son of God
[1:09:00] but they created a situation
[1:09:04] how much more we in this day
[1:09:09] the fire is not dead and we're gonna
[1:09:12] stand word for our problem is that's the
[1:09:15] problem I asked we've become too
[1:09:17] comfortable yeah
[1:09:19] we've become real comfortable in where
[1:09:22] we're at it's the most become of us
[1:09:24] don't understand us our walk is just a
[1:09:26] good amount of distance
[1:09:29] we have just the right amount of
[1:09:32] troubles and trials
[1:09:36] we don't want to get closer to the flame
[1:09:41] because then our worldliness starts to
[1:09:43] burn off
[1:09:46] in our basic elements start to burn
[1:09:51] it's too hot in there
[1:10:01] just warm enough to stay warm and not
[1:10:04] freeze
[1:10:08] and we're comfortable
[1:10:12] but it's in that furnace
[1:10:15] that's the only place
[1:10:18] where the deity that's created
[1:10:22] is the result of melting the gold
[1:10:28] it melts together
[1:10:32] and it creates a new element is
[1:10:36] the new being
[1:10:39] and as we go into 2023
[1:10:44] our prayer shouldn't be Lord make it
[1:10:47] easier
[1:10:50] our prayer should be
[1:10:53] Lord let's create the situations
[1:11:05] Jesus told Peter yes
[1:11:19] or was it 13 000 degrees foreign
[1:11:53] I didn't understand it Diego and Kayla
[1:11:57] I didn't understand why I'm where I'm at
[1:12:00] in London
[1:12:03] get it now
[1:12:05] I got you comfortable
[1:12:09] and I stopped in my body getting into
[1:12:12] that furnace
[1:12:15] you find yourself
[1:12:18] cold and formal informal
[1:12:22] 2023 is your year 20 minutes
[1:12:26] youth this is your time
[1:12:29] don't ask why things happen to you
[1:12:34] you know
[1:12:36] that he's creating the situation
[1:12:41] to warm up what's inside of you
[1:12:45] you didn't have the privilege that I did
[1:12:49] um
[1:12:53] foreign
[1:14:01] that fire is not dead
[1:14:05] it's just hiding
[1:14:07] just waiting
[1:14:10] for somebody
[1:14:12] to rekindle the flight
[1:14:17] [Applause]
[1:14:33] foreign
[1:14:36] my goodness
[1:14:39] how do you follow that
[1:14:41] brother Ronnie and Brother Carlos
[1:14:44] Carlos we'll do our best this morning
[1:14:50] 23.3 a new year
[1:14:53] it only brought me to this when I got
[1:14:55] the text last night
[1:14:57] Matthew 16 24
[1:15:02] and it reads lay
[1:15:04] then said Jesus unto his disciples and
[1:15:07] since Jesus If any man will come after
[1:15:10] me
[1:15:12] let him deny himself and take up his
[1:15:16] cross to Mr Cruz and follow me 25 for
[1:15:20] whosoever will save his life
[1:15:25] and whosoever will lose his life for my
[1:15:29] sake
[1:15:30] foreign
[1:15:33] so we find ourselves in a situation
[1:15:36] I find myself in a situation
[1:15:39] brother Caleb said something in one of
[1:15:42] his sermons
[1:15:45] and he was talking about how the Jews
[1:15:48] believe something
[1:15:51] how was in this Western World how we
[1:15:53] believe
[1:15:57] how we believe in this area we believe
[1:16:00] it by information
[1:16:02] we know definitions to words
[1:16:06] and we speak words
[1:16:09] but we see the Jews what he does the way
[1:16:13] he knows certain words
[1:16:21] so we see that only just say per se the
[1:16:24] word love since we've been talking about
[1:16:25] it
[1:16:33] but they live it out so they actually go
[1:16:37] and love somebody
[1:16:38] so there's many times even as ministers
[1:16:42] many times we know definitions
[1:16:45] definitions we speak it or we preach it
[1:16:48] but we never go and act it out
[1:16:51] so I find myself in certain areas in my
[1:16:55] life
[1:16:56] I have a lot of information
[1:16:58] I speak a lot of things but I don't live
[1:17:02] a lot of those things
[1:17:04] so it's a predicament we find ourselves
[1:17:08] in a predicament
[1:17:09] you know brother Ronnie took me down
[1:17:11] memory lane
[1:17:15] because he said that it was through a
[1:17:17] Godly mother
[1:17:19] and I can confirm that because all I've
[1:17:23] ever seen from her
[1:17:24] is someone stands through thick and
[1:17:26] thins
[1:17:28] someone stand with her husband
[1:17:31] through thick and thin
[1:17:33] even though he wasn't in the message
[1:17:37] someone that stood with her pastor are
[1:17:39] you thinking
[1:17:42] when people would maybe speak evil
[1:17:45] she was one of the ones that stood
[1:17:49] because
[1:17:56] remember that your children are watching
[1:18:00] your children are looking up to you
[1:18:03] they're looking at how we handle
[1:18:05] situations
[1:18:07] how we react to certain things
[1:18:10] how we react when certain bad things
[1:18:12] happen in our lives
[1:18:15] they're watching so they'll always
[1:18:18] remember that so when they grow up
[1:18:22] they're either going to react the way
[1:18:24] they're going to react to what they saw
[1:18:27] so if you're a golly man or a woman
[1:18:32] and you stand through any opposition
[1:18:36] more than likely the children will stand
[1:18:38] the same way possible
[1:18:40] but if we run tuck Taylor and run for
[1:18:43] anything
[1:18:46] that's probably what the children will
[1:18:48] do
[1:18:49] so in saying this so I remember my
[1:18:54] brother
[1:18:55] he's six years younger than me
[1:18:58] at that time I was doing my own thing
[1:19:02] but through the instruction of her
[1:19:04] mother
[1:19:06] through the Council of like he said of
[1:19:09] our past founding pastors
[1:19:13] but I would watch him
[1:19:16] because he would go and he would read
[1:19:18] brother Branham books all the time
[1:19:21] and what he would do is he would initial
[1:19:23] them
[1:19:25] just for the ones that he read
[1:19:28] so I went into his room one time
[1:19:31] and I looked and he had a stack probably
[1:19:34] about that big
[1:19:35] a little boy
[1:19:39] because of a Godly mother
[1:19:41] through instructions that he received
[1:19:45] it started that spark Brother Carlos
[1:19:50] in that young man so me being older I
[1:19:55] would actually look up to him
[1:20:27] to know that this is where God dwells
[1:20:30] to know that the what the prophet says
[1:20:40] where we have to do this this year
[1:20:43] it has to be what's called The Chain
[1:20:45] Reaction
[1:20:47] it has to happen in us first
[1:20:50] it has to happen in the individual first
[1:20:53] I have to get knowledge
[1:20:56] I have to
[1:21:10] but I have to act now
[1:21:13] does that make sense to everybody
[1:21:16] so if I preach peace
[1:21:19] but I don't live peace there's something
[1:21:23] missing
[1:21:24] elements
[1:21:26] in me and me amen amen watch Watch chain
[1:21:31] reaction
[1:21:32] it's a chemical reaction
[1:21:35] or a process in which the products
[1:21:38] themselves
[1:21:40] promote or spread the reaction
[1:21:45] which under certain conditions
[1:21:49] May accelerate dramatically
[1:21:52] number two Segunda a series of events
[1:21:56] by the previous one
[1:21:59] so keep the word chain reaction in mind
[1:22:03] look at each other really quick just
[1:22:05] look at each other
[1:22:06] and I'll do that for a reason okay
[1:22:10] but we have to die to ourselves
[1:22:13] we have to carry our cross
[1:22:16] and die to ourselves
[1:22:19] so that this human nature
[1:22:22] this the human Tendencies
[1:22:25] of wanting to just speak
[1:23:11] so what we have to do today
[1:23:14] as this fire this this flame of brother
[1:23:17] Henry and he comes and he ignites me
[1:23:22] then I can go and ignite this brother
[1:23:25] can ignite
[1:23:39] you know there's elements that make up a
[1:23:42] fire Elementos
[1:23:46] it's needed to sustain combustion is
[1:23:50] some type of fuel
[1:23:52] right it has to burn something whether
[1:23:55] it's wood whatever
[1:23:56] and heat
[1:23:58] obviously the fire puts our heat
[1:24:02] a heat source is
[1:24:11] but you know that there's a fourth
[1:24:13] element
[1:24:14] that fourth element is the fire itself
[1:24:20] it's like I said it's just a flame if
[1:24:22] it's by itself
[1:24:24] but it actually turns into a fire
[1:24:27] a raging fires
[1:24:30] when there's a chain reaction in the
[1:24:32] people
[1:24:33] like I said first of all in the
[1:24:36] individuals
[1:24:37] then to your brother
[1:24:39] now is it a coincidence
[1:24:42] that there was a fourth element in the
[1:24:44] fire
[1:24:45] with the three Hebrew children
[1:24:48] there was a fourth one in there
[1:24:51] there was a fourth man in there and that
[1:24:55] was God in us yes
[1:24:56] we die to ourselves
[1:24:59] we get ignited no sense the fourth
[1:25:03] element is a combustion
[1:25:05] to ignite your brothers and that's only
[1:25:09] him only he could do this
[1:25:12] like I said we're dead to ourselves
[1:25:48] and burn everything out of us
[1:25:51] because we even have to love foreign
[1:26:15] and the form of the fourth is like the
[1:26:18] Son of God
[1:26:21] and one quote he says
[1:26:24] he fanned the fire okay
[1:26:27] he found the fire from them they use
[1:26:30] have you ever found a fire before
[1:26:33] what happens when you fan of fire
[1:26:38] now don't think of the Hebrew children
[1:26:41] back then foreign
[1:27:33] but just and and they were tested if we
[1:27:37] don't provados are we tested today
[1:27:39] we need not go through tests every day
[1:27:43] that's all we have to Die daily is
[1:27:45] located they have to keep that fire
[1:27:47] going
[1:27:49] we have to add the oxygen
[1:27:52] the fuel is
[1:27:56] because they cannot burn out
[1:27:59] if it burns
[1:28:02] we start to get cold because
[1:28:06] you get isolated
[1:28:08] we start to think that people don't love
[1:28:10] us
[1:28:12] to think that the passion doesn't care
[1:28:14] about it
[1:28:16] or the minister doesn't care about us
[1:28:18] They don't love me in that church so I
[1:28:22] gotta isolate myself
[1:28:31] watch this and we're and they were
[1:28:34] tested
[1:28:37] whether they would worship images and
[1:28:39] break the word of God
[1:28:42] they stay true to the word
[1:28:46] regardless of the circle
[1:28:48] they say true to the words
[1:28:51] and when they were thrown them into the
[1:28:54] ferry
[1:28:56] watch this here I don't understand
[1:28:58] when they throw them into the fiery
[1:29:01] furnace
[1:29:02] God's promise was fulfilled
[1:29:06] they were thrown into the fiery foreign
[1:29:08] God's promise was fulfilled
[1:29:13] they possessed the gates of their
[1:29:14] enemies
[1:29:16] but there was a fourth man
[1:29:23] that unlocked
[1:29:27] from the fire del Fuego and it could do
[1:29:30] nothing
[1:29:31] but set them free because this you know
[1:29:35] why there was a key because this year is
[1:29:39] you can't get worn from a painted fire
[1:29:42] usted
[1:29:44] this year the heat is going to come out
[1:29:47] of that painter
[1:29:49] each and every one of us we have the key
[1:29:52] we have the council we've been talk
[1:29:56] correct
[1:29:59] we had the apostles
[1:30:33] and you shall not walk in the manners
[1:30:41] foreign
[1:31:20] not this year no estano this year is a
[1:31:23] different year because
[1:31:26] because our pastors rallying the church
[1:31:30] and this is the year yesterday I think
[1:31:33] whether we like it or not
[1:31:35] we have to pick up our crafts
[1:31:40] so we got a text last night at about 11
[1:31:42] o'clock
[1:31:45] usually ask us
[1:31:51] and he said there's a few guys going up
[1:31:55] um you and your brother are are one of
[1:31:58] those who stays
[1:32:00] so I think this is what we have in store
[1:32:05] this fire will come and burn everything
[1:32:07] out of us
[1:32:09] so that the new creation
[1:32:13] we know that after all this the
[1:32:15] Millennium after everything
[1:32:18] it will require a fire Romano
[1:32:49] that's all I have for you thank you
