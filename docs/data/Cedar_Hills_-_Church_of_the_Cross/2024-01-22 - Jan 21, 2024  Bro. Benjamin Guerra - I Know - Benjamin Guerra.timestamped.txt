[30:10] tonight I don't know if you
[30:13] remember but when we have a Friday night
[30:17] service it's an Evangelistic
[30:21] service so if you came
[30:24] tonight you better came with the m
[30:29] ready to ask
[30:31] God whatever you
[30:34] need that's why we're here
[30:36] tonight we're not here for any other
[30:40] reason but that the Saints of almighty
[30:44] God would call upon his
[30:47] name and he would
[30:49] answer so I I hope you you're ready for
[30:52] this
[30:53] tonight you know we serve a
[30:56] god
[31:00] that there's nothing impossible for
[31:03] him is there anything impossible for
[31:09] him
[31:11] nothing so if we call upon
[31:14] him he's got to
[31:17] answer but now we have to meet those
[31:23] requirements we got to meet the
[31:25] requirements that he's asking
[31:29] that if there's sin in our
[31:31] lives we got to correct
[31:33] it if there's sin in our
[31:36] midst we got to correct it so let's do
[31:40] that
[31:41] first and then no matter what you
[31:46] have God can answer
[31:48] you do you
[31:52] believe do you really believe
[31:54] tonight there's a man here
[31:58] that is
[32:00] hurting I believe that God is going to
[32:03] heal him
[32:05] tonight and I know there was a sister
[32:08] with a herur eye
[32:11] here God could heal her eye
[32:15] tonight but we got to believe
[32:18] it the prophet of God says if you could
[32:21] get the people to
[32:23] believe he says they're not even cancer
[32:29] that's the god that we serve he's not a
[32:32] god of
[32:33] halfway but he's a God that
[32:37] answers that when Elijah called upon
[32:40] Him fire came from
[32:43] heaven when Joshua needed more
[32:47] time the sun Stood Still it's the same
[32:52] God in our midst
[32:55] today but you got got to
[32:58] believe Revelations 2
[33:04] apyp Revelations 2:2
[33:10] apocalyps and it says I
[33:16] know you may be seated leave the
[33:19] scripture up
[33:20] there may God have the blessings to the
[33:22] reading of his
[33:24] word so we all know this scripture
[33:28] this is God talking to the Ephesian
[33:32] church it was the first church
[33:35] St but he starts off and he says I
[33:40] know what does that tell
[33:43] us he's telling his
[33:46] people I know what you're going
[33:49] through he said I
[33:51] know your
[33:53] Deeds I know your faithfulness
[33:58] that's what he's telling us
[34:00] tonight Church of the
[34:02] cross I
[34:04] know what this church stands
[34:07] for he says I
[34:10] know that you're a missionary minded
[34:13] church he says I
[34:16] know your
[34:19] hurts I know your
[34:23] labor I know you love
[34:25] me I know what you
[34:29] do God knows our
[34:32] hearts he knows our
[34:36] intent there's nothing that God don't
[34:40] know but many
[34:42] times we think God don't
[34:46] know we think he don't
[34:50] know he knows Ethan Ethan he knows
[34:55] what's am do you you believe
[34:58] it you know what you're asking
[35:01] for I don't
[35:03] know but you reached God
[35:07] tonight don't you lose
[35:09] it whatever you ask for going to give it
[35:13] to
[35:14] you he knows he knows your heart he
[35:18] knows you're hurt
[35:20] AJ God he knows he's going to heal you
[35:24] tonight Hallelujah
[35:28] he
[35:29] knows he knows the hurt that we go
[35:34] through he knows we
[35:37] fight he knows we
[35:40] toil he knows what we go
[35:43] through that's why when he
[35:46] came he didn't send someone
[35:49] else he came
[35:52] himself he wanted to better understand
[35:55] me
[35:57] he wanted to know what I go
[36:00] through he knew we all would have our
[36:03] own
[36:06] complexes he knew we would think
[36:10] things he knew we would think the
[36:12] brothers are talking about
[36:16] us he knows
[36:19] church and that's why the scripture
[36:22] says I know the
[36:25] works I know you're
[36:28] I know your
[36:31] patience I know thou
[36:33] can't can't not bear that which is
[36:38] evil and th thou has tried them that say
[36:41] they are
[36:44] Apostles he said your your foundation is
[36:49] well he says I know this he says but you
[36:53] know what I have one thing against
[36:59] holy
[37:02] moly wow wow how could he tell
[37:07] us all that we've done
[37:11] well that he's proud of
[37:15] us but all after all of
[37:18] that he says but hold
[37:20] on I got one thing against
[37:24] you wait a minute
[37:28] remember I
[37:29] said now we got to fix what's broken
[37:32] inside of
[37:34] us if we haven't met those
[37:38] requirements they got to be met
[37:44] first our hearts have to be
[37:47] right we see Time After
[37:50] Time the word in its
[37:54] Purity preached behind this
[37:58] Pulpit the word hits me
[38:02] first it hits the minister
[38:05] first so we don't come
[38:08] here trying to tell you to correct
[38:13] yourself God beats us up
[38:17] first and I got to say
[38:20] church I had a bad
[38:25] attitude you know we had a rough year
[38:27] last
[38:29] year I remember there was months I was
[38:32] gone more than I slept in my own
[38:38] bed and we're not
[38:40] bragging but you know what
[38:43] church we came at the end of the
[38:46] year and I wasn't paying
[38:50] attention because because we every time
[38:53] we
[38:55] serve the devil has every
[38:58] right to hit us
[39:00] back and me as a
[39:03] dummy I wasn't paying
[39:06] attention and I began to get
[39:09] depressed I began to feel like
[39:13] nothing because that's what
[39:16] happens the prophet of God says I will
[39:20] restore the years the P
[39:25] wor the year
[39:29] Locust but many times we
[39:33] forget that those same
[39:36] insects they're still
[39:39] around those sticky little
[39:42] boogers they're trying to sneak in the
[39:46] church they're trying to get us
[39:49] depressed they're trying to get our
[39:51] heads
[39:54] down they try to sneak
[39:58] again but you know what he
[40:01] said the prophet of God said he saids
[40:05] when those
[40:06] worms when those
[40:09] beetles eat the tree all the way down to
[40:11] the
[40:13] stump he said you know
[40:16] what he said a branch try to grow
[40:20] here he says it was a
[40:23] denominational he said he try he pruned
[40:26] it down
[40:27] another one came up
[40:30] denominational he said he pred it he
[40:33] says but through all
[40:35] this he said what the devil didn't
[40:38] know that inside the
[40:41] heart of that tree it was
[40:45] growing it was getting
[40:48] stronger so if the safe thing is
[40:50] happening
[40:52] today they're trying to sneak
[40:55] in trying to make you feel
[40:58] bad they're trying to make you feel like
[41:00] a little
[41:03] yeah that's what we are many
[41:05] times complaining about
[41:08] everything oh this is
[41:11] that I don't like how the windows
[41:13] came I don't like
[41:15] this well maybe God don't like
[41:19] you attitude maybe he don't like your
[41:25] condition you see those beetles they
[41:27] come
[41:28] in but you know what he said he said I
[41:32] will
[41:33] restore he said all the
[41:35] years all the years that were
[41:38] e and Christ is the
[41:41] mystery brother says what are those
[41:45] years is that all the
[41:47] healings all the
[41:50] blessings all the
[41:52] Miracles that pertain to
[41:54] you pertain to me amen I'm going to
[41:58] restore
[42:00] those I'll I'll tell you something
[42:04] church I want to so
[42:07] bad my own
[42:09] life I want it to catch
[42:13] up to the messages that are being
[42:18] preached as many times we
[42:22] think through our
[42:25] complaints
[42:27] oh that that message is too good for
[42:30] us it looks
[42:33] high it's so
[42:36] impossible you know what there's nothing
[42:39] impossible for
[42:41] God he said you've lost
[42:46] Focus you've lost
[42:49] Focus he says where has the where did
[42:52] you leave the first
[42:55] love
[42:56] that energy that you
[42:59] had when you came to the
[43:01] Lord you were ready to do
[43:05] anything where where to go where's it at
[43:10] church it's
[43:12] here I want to lose my
[43:17] attitude I want to Lo lose everything
[43:20] bad that I
[43:24] do but many times we as
[43:28] ministers I'm sorry to say
[43:31] this but we're afraid to admit
[43:36] it we're afraid to admit
[43:42] it because many
[43:44] times even as
[43:47] Christians we think we're without
[43:51] sin we think we're so
[43:55] holy we think we can't be
[43:58] touched and then we find ourselves in
[44:00] the same
[44:02] place as the Pharisees and
[44:06] sades that they were looking at
[44:09] Jesus you don't do
[44:13] that we know a law that's greater than
[44:18] that but if we could be for real
[44:21] church and I I don't I don't know I
[44:24] don't know about you
[44:28] but if brother Caleb wasn't my
[44:31] pastor I don't know who else could teach
[44:36] me and I hope every church that's
[44:38] listening to this
[44:41] message has the same opinion about their
[44:49] Pastor I remember years
[44:52] ago we all every one of you
[44:57] was cing at this
[45:00] altar when our found Pastor got
[45:04] sick do you remember that
[45:06] time do you remember the toils we've
[45:09] gone
[45:11] through we felt so
[45:16] abandoned we felt so in
[45:19] loveed and then you go
[45:23] back church I'm sorry to say this
[45:27] there's days I get
[45:29] up and I tell
[45:32] myself the guy back
[45:34] there could be so disappointed to see
[45:37] you
[45:40] today he expected more out of
[45:43] you he wanted your growth to be
[45:47] higher so you see how
[45:51] easy these insects can come
[45:54] in and put this dark shadow that comes
[45:58] upon the
[46:00] church when our pastor
[46:04] toils he gives his life for this
[46:07] place for the souls for the
[46:10] souls for
[46:13] me we take it for
[46:16] granted I take it for
[46:18] granted but I'm tired of playing
[46:24] games because you know what the prophet
[46:26] of God
[46:28] says he says in that first
[46:32] love he says that's where the power
[46:36] ISS that's where the power
[46:40] lay many times through
[46:44] maturity we think that power is going to
[46:46] get
[46:49] there but he said this from your first
[46:53] love from your first word
[46:57] he says that's where the power
[47:03] lay but many
[47:05] times we don't take God for what he's
[47:12] worth he's
[47:15] powerful he's
[47:17] mighty there's nothing too great for
[47:20] him this is for you brother
[47:24] Diego
[47:28] what time did I
[47:35] start I I wanted to calm your
[47:39] nerves you know brother Diego has a
[47:44] saying that every time the preacher
[47:46] wants more
[47:49] time he asked the people how much when
[47:51] did I
[47:54] start
[47:56] but you know what
[47:57] church why don't to calm your
[48:01] nerves because it's time for us to come
[48:03] up
[48:05] high we don't got we we ain't got a
[48:07] whole lot of
[48:09] time but we're
[48:12] afraid to call God on the
[48:16] scene we're afraid to call him on the
[48:21] scene because there's sin in the
[48:24] camp we don't realize and you say
[48:27] brother what are you
[48:30] saying Paul said I sin
[48:34] daily he was an apostle of
[48:38] God but it's the little things
[48:41] church it's the little
[48:43] things that hurt the
[48:47] Lord like oh we have another Sunday
[48:49] night
[48:53] service the youth have another UD
[48:59] doesn't the pastor know we have lives
[49:06] too these are the things that hold it
[49:13] back you know the gifts that God has
[49:15] placed in this
[49:19] church they're
[49:21] here and we know what the scripture says
[49:23] gifts and callings are without repent
[49:29] but the gifts are for
[49:32] you but when we doubt when the gifts are
[49:35] in
[49:37] operation we are holding something back
[49:41] we're holding something
[49:43] back and I don't look at this physical
[49:48] body but I look to the spiritual
[49:52] aspect we are getting their Church
[49:56] the coming of the Lord is the
[50:00] hand he said that you knew God was
[50:03] coming
[50:05] today he said what would you
[50:08] do would you
[50:11] repent would you give your life to
[50:14] God if you knew he was coming
[50:17] today but you know what
[50:19] church he's here
[50:22] today whatever you need he is here
[50:27] huah don't be afraid to ask
[50:30] him don't be afraid to give your life to
[50:34] him your brother and sisters need
[50:38] you they want you because what did that
[50:42] what was the leaves eating for the
[50:45] leaves when they ate at
[50:51] them come on youth when you answer
[50:54] it
[50:58] anyone
[51:02] Fellowship I don't know about
[51:06] you but I don't Fellowship the way I
[51:08] used
[51:13] to what's my
[51:17] excuse I don't have a
[51:20] house
[51:22] right what's your
[51:24] excuse
[51:25] I work too
[51:28] much I have kids that are children that
[51:30] I have to
[51:33] raise you see how easy it is to make
[51:38] excuses but he says let's start off with
[51:44] first he didn't say you lost your first
[51:49] love he said you left it
[51:54] right so it's it's in
[51:57] reach it's in
[51:59] reach it's not too far
[52:02] away he says okay I'm going to tell you
[52:07] this but I'm going to tell you how to
[52:09] get
[52:12] back but he said
[52:14] first what does that
[52:17] mean why do he use
[52:21] first why did he use first
[52:24] Noah
[52:27] he doesn't like being
[52:31] second he doesn't like being
[52:35] second but every time I use the
[52:40] excuse I don't have a
[52:43] home I just put God
[52:46] second every time I
[52:49] say I can't make it to prayer
[52:53] service I put him second
[52:57] every time I
[52:58] say I didn't call Brother Ronnie that
[53:01] they didn't tell him I loved
[53:03] him I put him
[53:06] second every time I didn't show up to
[53:08] church
[53:10] sometime I put him
[53:13] second every time that I don't pick up
[53:17] my Bible and read
[53:19] it I put him
[53:21] second every time I don't pray I put
[53:25] second you know God is not built that
[53:30] way he it's it's not normal for
[53:34] him to be put in second
[53:37] place he's a jealous God and he demands
[53:43] Perfection but church I don't want to
[53:46] put him
[53:48] second I want to have that what the
[53:50] pastor preached
[53:53] on which is called preach
[53:57] preeminence that he's
[53:59] first not second but many times this is
[54:02] a bad
[54:04] part he's third and
[54:07] fourth he's not even
[54:11] second but he wants to be
[54:16] first his big
[54:20] complaint is that we don't put it
[54:24] first telling
[54:27] us so if we don't put him
[54:31] first then what are we
[54:34] doing what's in first what is in
[54:40] first whatever it
[54:43] is what have we
[54:45] done we've created an idol
[54:50] now we've created an
[54:53] idol we're going backwards in
[54:57] time it doesn't matter what it
[55:00] is many times we'll even put a
[55:04] job before
[55:08] God cuz it doesn't
[55:11] matter if your job is getting in the
[55:16] way you're saying God can't give you a
[55:19] job that won't be
[55:24] there God will give you a better
[55:30] job he don't like excuses he wants to be
[55:34] first because when we put Idols in front
[55:37] of
[55:39] us the prophet of God says the statue of
[55:42] a perfect
[55:45] man he says all these
[55:47] unbelievers he says what do they do they
[55:51] prostate
[55:52] themselves in front of the idols
[55:56] he said to the point where that
[55:59] Idol begins to be
[56:03] healing it begins to even move
[56:08] itself that's what he
[56:10] says cuz they believe so much in the
[56:14] idol that is doing weird
[56:17] stuff stuff imaginary in their
[56:21] mind because that's what the devil uses
[56:25] he uses your
[56:27] mind that's his
[56:29] Battlefront but we fall in that trap
[56:32] every
[56:34] time and we let Idols become in our
[56:40] midst thinking we're
[56:44] Christians what do we
[56:46] do we put
[56:49] religion we put the Church of the
[56:52] cross in front in front of our
[56:55] relationship with
[56:58] him that that one hurt
[57:01] me that one hurt
[57:03] me because we all have nicknames around
[57:06] here we all have
[57:11] nicknames I like my
[57:15] nickname whatever you do Caleb that
[57:18] Caleb says you do
[57:21] it that's all you got on me I'll take it
[57:23] all day long
[57:26] but but but we began to to throw at each
[57:30] other but
[57:32] God he still sometimes weaks at our
[57:38] ignorance and these Idols become
[57:42] present they come become
[57:45] present that our
[57:50] relationship because we say okay I got
[57:52] to do this for the church I got to do
[57:54] that for the church
[57:57] and we forget our relationship with
[58:04] God now let's
[58:06] go to the queen of the
[58:08] South the Queen of
[58:12] Sheba what was
[58:14] she she was an
[58:17] idolatrous she came from the land of
[58:21] idolatry now here's the reverse pattern
[58:24] of it
[58:26] all she knew was
[58:28] Idols but one day she heard
[58:32] something she said she heard something
[58:34] about
[58:36] Solomon and something began to activate
[58:38] inside of her she looked at her
[58:42] Idol and she heard the
[58:45] stories she looked at the idol but then
[58:48] she heard the
[58:50] story but she says I got to go see
[58:52] what's
[58:53] happening
[58:55] when she met
[58:57] Solomon the prophet of God's said it was
[59:01] such a great
[59:04] experience that she left her
[59:09] Idols all she knew how to
[59:12] do was grab
[59:15] something she was trying to grab
[59:18] something to replace the
[59:22] idol he said she met her first
[59:26] love she met something
[59:29] great something that was
[59:32] Godly he said she didn't know what to
[59:35] do all she could
[59:38] do was grab a piece of
[59:41] dirt and she says I got to take this
[59:44] back with
[59:45] [Applause]
[59:47] me could you
[59:49] imagine if God would make that same
[59:51] impression on you
[59:53] today
[59:55] that you're just so blown
[59:58] away of his grace and his
[1:00:00] Mercy that all you can do is grab
[1:00:05] dirt everybody would think you're
[1:00:09] crazy but we do crazy
[1:00:13] things when we're in
[1:00:18] love we do crazy
[1:00:23] things and you know I I I
[1:00:26] wish I wish brother
[1:00:29] Lorenzo would use his own
[1:00:33] stories when he gets behind the
[1:00:37] pulpit but he always wants to use my
[1:00:41] stories and I don't
[1:00:43] appreciate he's always saying how I used
[1:00:45] to write my wife
[1:00:49] letters use your own love story now
[1:00:52] buddy but you know that's what what it
[1:00:54] does for
[1:00:55] us I remember I couldn't wait to write
[1:00:59] her a
[1:01:01] letter I couldn't wait to see
[1:01:04] her because something
[1:01:07] happened Something in My Heart began to
[1:01:11] activate but when I met the
[1:01:14] Lord that was
[1:01:17] different it I got more
[1:01:20] crazy I couldn't do
[1:01:22] nothing but jump and
[1:01:25] out I couldn't do
[1:01:27] nothing but
[1:01:29] scream it got so
[1:01:31] crazy that the
[1:01:34] sisters the sisters from s
[1:01:36] Miguel the sisters from V's
[1:01:39] Court they would play around and make
[1:01:41] fun of
[1:01:42] me jacine used to say something jacine
[1:01:46] used to say
[1:01:47] something she'll be she'll be laughing
[1:01:50] at me I said this is all I
[1:01:53] know I get crazy when I
[1:01:56] sing I get crazy when I talk about God's
[1:02:01] word because that was my first
[1:02:04] love and I knew nothing
[1:02:07] else nothing
[1:02:09] mattered something activated inside of
[1:02:15] me but why did he say
[1:02:19] last he said you've
[1:02:22] compromised your religion
[1:02:24] for my
[1:02:31] relationship he says
[1:02:34] don't he says now I'm going to tell
[1:02:37] you how to get
[1:02:39] back he says
[1:02:42] remember he says
[1:02:46] remember
[1:02:48] remember and I began to
[1:02:50] remember I began to
[1:02:53] remember I began to
[1:02:56] remember and we go
[1:02:58] back and God never left
[1:03:02] us we thought he was gone the whole
[1:03:06] time but he said
[1:03:08] remember he said then
[1:03:11] repent
[1:03:13] repent of what you've
[1:03:16] done he says
[1:03:18] then he says you will do
[1:03:21] what he says you will be an overcomer
[1:03:25] to him that
[1:03:27] overcome will I grant to sit with
