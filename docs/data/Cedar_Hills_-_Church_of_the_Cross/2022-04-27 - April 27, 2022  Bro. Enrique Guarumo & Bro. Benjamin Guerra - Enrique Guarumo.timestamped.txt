[34:32] may the lord jesus
[34:37] let us open our bibles
[34:43] we're going to be turning to hebrews
[34:44] chapter 11.
[35:01] this evening we're going to be speaking
[35:02] on a little bit on the face
[35:13] hebrews 11 1
[35:28] now faith is a substance of things hoped
[35:30] for the evidence of things not seen
[35:33] let us pray
[35:35] father
[35:37] beloved lord and heavenly father
[35:41] we come before your presence
[35:56] have you made us
[35:58] worthy of every promise of yours
[36:02] and at this hour i ask
[36:07] that what you have inspired me
[36:09] to speak
[36:21] i
[36:22] believe that you still have the power to
[36:24] close
[37:01] many different ways
[37:19] but we understand that faith is a
[37:21] revelation as a revelation
[37:28] and the first issue that we find here in
[37:30] the bible
[37:32] that
[37:33] by revelation
[37:39] abel offered a more excellent sacrifice
[37:45] and there is where the first problem
[37:46] arised
[38:02] is
[38:06] it is a faith it is a substance
[38:12] and i want to i want to stay there for a
[38:13] little bit
[38:15] on the substance
[38:18] is because many times como cristianos as
[38:22] christians
[38:25] or i want to make a clarification here
[38:30] al christianism
[38:38] we have to understand that it's not just
[38:39] another religion
[38:43] it is a a way of of living a way of life
[38:48] different from the world
[38:52] when we come to christianity
[38:57] and we have to understand that it is to
[38:59] be like christ
[39:05] and and to begin in christianity
[39:09] we have been showed
[39:21] that the first thing that you receive
[39:22] when you are born again
[39:26] faith
[39:29] because you cannot have faith
[39:33] before you are born again
[39:37] and i'm not talking about the faith that
[39:38] the world has
[39:42] i am talking about the faith of
[39:43] christianity
[39:49] because there are there is faith of many
[39:51] religions
[39:54] but the only faith that that god accepts
[39:58] is that of christ
[40:02] because he is the the author and
[40:04] finisher of our faith
[40:09] and as we go forth
[40:14] you're going to find out that in the
[40:15] statute
[40:18] the first thing that we are going to
[40:19] encounter is faith
[40:29] so that attribute was the first
[40:31] attribute to the first church age
[40:36] but
[40:50] and the people began to fall from that
[40:52] faith
[40:57] and that was the correction that god
[40:58] gave to that church
[41:03] because they lost that first love
[41:09] you know that faith and love they go
[41:10] together
[41:16] the prophet said that they
[41:18] contain
[41:47] found a very uh pleasing
[41:50] story
[41:54] and it is and it is on on peter
[41:57] pedro
[41:59] and we know peter that he was very
[42:01] tremendous
[42:07] and one day he told the lord lord i will
[42:09] be with you unto death
[42:14] and he didn't carry that sword just
[42:16] because they gave it to him
[42:21] because he he had it because if he had
[42:23] to use it he was going to use it
[42:28] to
[42:30] and we know that the prophet says that
[42:32] he didn't want to just use a sword and
[42:33] cut the ear off
[42:36] he wanted to cut off his head
[42:39] he said
[42:42] jesus
[42:44] but the prophet says that jesus he
[42:46] corrected the error of peter
[42:52] how many times is jesus correcting our
[42:54] heirs
[43:01] because if there is something to
[43:03] christianity
[43:07] there should exist conviction
[43:11] and i would like to ask everyone a
[43:13] question
[43:16] why are you a christian
[43:17] porque es cristiano why why are you a
[43:20] christian
[43:23] el mundo
[43:39] the prophet says that they are scared
[43:44] we have a saying that says if those who
[43:47] have fear no puede pelia cannot fight
[44:06] they were in the middle of the sea
[44:11] and when they were there
[44:13] jesus they had left jesus
[44:18] and that's why the prophet says that
[44:19] when you leave jesus
[44:23] that's when the problems arise
[44:27] fundamental so then in christianity the
[44:30] faith is so fundamental
[44:34] is
[44:37] because that is where the basis of
[44:38] christianity is
[44:44] so there is where they began to show us
[44:46] teach us
[45:14] why a woman should dress correctly
[45:19] and i asked the question
[45:22] because i know it's not just here
[45:24] locally
[45:28] but they're in your homes brother
[45:30] or sister
[45:45] oh do you know why you must wear a dress
[45:47] i go dancing see you something so simple
[45:53] it's not as simple as just saying oh
[45:55] well
[45:57] because the church says
[46:12] they come to the end
[46:15] they are going to say
[46:19] what bad is it when they come to age
[46:21] they're going to say well how bad is it
[46:26] that's why the bible says
[46:30] for teaching
[46:32] for correction
[46:56] the people don't even know why they are
[46:58] christians
[47:03] you you show your children
[47:49] that it is a dishonor
[47:53] yolo pencil
[47:55] i will think about it and meditate on it
[48:00] but that's why faith should have a
[48:02] foundation
[48:04] question
[48:11] because without faith it is impossible
[48:15] it's impossible it is impossible
[48:18] for
[48:31] but without revelation it is impossible
[48:33] brother
[48:34] or sister
[48:36] to please god
[48:41] and where does all this begin
[48:45] at your house
[49:00] than to sit down and read a verse of the
[49:02] bible
[49:07] and we know that it's true
[49:11] i see it for myself
[49:15] because many times we're in such a hurry
[49:19] that we don't even have time to pray
[49:27] when god the prophet says that god is
[49:29] never in in a hurry
[49:33] oh he has to we got to run over here you
[49:35] got to turn off the light gotta run here
[49:36] and there
[49:39] our faith
[49:41] is
[49:55] there is one thing that paralyzes faith
[50:01] brother you you may say oh brother i i
[50:04] just don't feel like i'm able
[50:08] oh brother it's such a burden to go to
[50:09] church
[50:16] sometimes we come and we don't even have
[50:18] a reason why we come
[50:20] this
[50:21] the prophet says
[50:23] don't permit
[50:29] a root of bitterness rise up against
[50:31] their brother
[50:34] because that paralyzes faith
[50:40] as much as as the preacher gets up and
[50:42] preaches
[50:46] as he preaches as hard as he can
[50:51] but if you have a root of bitterness
[50:53] again
[50:56] it'll come in one year and out the other
[50:58] iwa
[51:00] and you're going to continue the same
[51:03] forest
[51:04] that's why faith cometh foreign
[51:17] hearing music is good
[51:20] christian music
[51:26] but that's not how revelation comes
[51:32] revelation comes through his word
[51:57] what am i going to do today
[52:39] and that begins at my home
[52:54] there is something that broke my heart
[52:55] and i have to be honest with you
[52:59] i have to be honest
[53:05] as as i was doing this
[53:08] and as i was thinking on these things
[53:26] and for me up to a certain point it's
[53:28] okay
[53:32] and brothers i i didn't even know
[53:35] especially
[53:38] i saw a little
[53:39] a little white line there
[53:43] oh brothers and they hurt me so much
[53:49] because when it comes down to you is
[53:50] taking the story of your face
[53:53] it is more precious
[54:08] and i remember that the prophet when one
[54:10] day a young lady came to him
[54:16] and the this young lady asked for
[54:17] brother branham so why don't they let me
[54:19] sing in the choir
[54:21] and
[54:22] have you
[54:24] ever
[54:25] have you ever asked why
[54:30] oh because maybe i use a little bit of
[54:32] makeup
[54:36] on
[55:04] what
[55:47] oh well i'm an american no you are a
[55:49] christian
[55:52] you have to identify yourself with him
[55:54] [Applause]
[55:58] and prove really if you are a christian
[56:00] or not
[56:02] principio and if you are not come to the
[56:05] beginning
[56:06] to the principles
[56:12] ask yourselves oh lord
[56:14] ask yourself how lord how can i come
[56:16] back to this
[56:20] that's why zechariah is remembered
[56:24] and he said lord what do i do
[57:28] have you ever asked yourselves what it
[57:30] is
[57:32] the prophet said
[57:36] to deny the faith
[58:05] am i ready to go with the lord
[58:10] the prophet of god says it's not you
[58:12] waiting for god
[58:14] it's god waiting for you
[58:20] to
[58:32] we have to search our faith
[58:47] we're going to find out that peter when
[58:48] he was in these tremendous streets
[58:51] the prophet said
[58:54] that peter was about at the point of
[58:56] death
[59:00] and he said lord is that you permeate
[59:10] and peter walked on the water
[59:12] he got me no did he walk on the water
[59:29] when the circumstances arised
[59:35] it was the waves
[59:42] because you say i have
[1:00:04] peter began to disappear
[1:00:08] to perish
[1:00:10] and says and then
[1:00:21] and when the circumstances arise
[1:00:25] we began to think
[1:00:41] like the rest of them
[1:00:46] but it's not like that bro
[1:00:48] that's not the way it is brothers
[1:00:51] hermanos you are not the same as the
[1:00:53] rest
[1:01:06] he knew that the only way that he could
[1:01:08] curse the people of israel
[1:01:12] is for them to to mix
[1:01:16] you wanted to to make them mix
[1:01:21] allah
[1:01:26] he was a prophet on a salary
[1:01:30] and then he he looked further away
[1:01:33] you look for a wave to make them fall
[1:01:36] and what happened
[1:01:39] he did it
[1:01:40] he found a way yeah
[1:01:43] and then he says okay lord
[1:01:47] now i can curse them
[1:02:04] when you
[1:02:18] don't
[1:02:32] don't bring nothing of denomination
[1:02:35] you know why no
[1:02:36] it doesn't work
[1:02:41] because this is a new kingdom
[1:02:44] it is a new people
[1:02:51] this is to be born again
[1:03:32] lord many times it is difficult
[1:03:36] but heavenly father
[1:03:38] you called us
[1:03:42] help
[1:03:55] destroy all that is bad in our life
[1:03:59] that we may be good christians
[1:04:02] in your head
[1:04:03] in the name of the lord jesus christ
[1:04:08] [Music]
[1:04:35] was
[1:04:50] hey man don't you love him tonight
[1:04:55] [Applause]
[1:04:59] and also give one to the lord for
[1:05:02] senor
[1:05:04] for such a beautiful message
[1:05:06] [Applause]
[1:05:20] certain things but
[1:05:22] but it's god's word
[1:05:25] amen and that's at the at the end of the
[1:05:27] day we have to realize that's god's word
[1:05:29] and
[1:05:30] and when it comes
[1:05:38] [Music]
[1:05:45] amen and many many times we don't
[1:05:48] understand
[1:05:49] really what the new birth process is
[1:05:53] the process
[1:05:55] many times we fall flat on our face
[1:06:01] but we gotta get up amen
[1:06:19] and it reads like this
[1:06:23] i hear the pages
[1:06:28] amen we thank our pastor for the
[1:06:30] opportunity that he's given us this
[1:06:31] night to
[1:06:33] speak to the bride of christ amen
[1:06:41] also i say unto you whosoever shall
[1:06:43] confess me before men
[1:06:46] him shall the son of man also confess
[1:06:49] before the angels of god
[1:06:58] but he that denieth me before man
[1:07:02] shall be denied before the angels of god
[1:07:10] amen you may be seated
[1:07:13] and may god add his blessings to the
[1:07:15] reading of his word amen
[1:07:19] amen and and i know it's not by some
[1:07:21] coincidence i know god's always in
[1:07:23] control
[1:07:26] in control
[1:07:38] was talking in the back i just you know
[1:07:40] started thanking the lord for
[1:07:42] for his guidance amen
[1:07:49] amen and if i were to put a title would
[1:07:52] be converted
[1:07:56] you know many times we you know
[1:07:58] i didn't understand what the
[1:08:00] what it meant when we hear are you
[1:08:02] converted
[1:08:07] you know i always saw it as a process of
[1:08:09] the new birth
[1:08:11] process
[1:08:13] but we we see and we hear you know many
[1:08:15] things that peter had to go go through
[1:08:21] and you know
[1:08:23] it seems which
[1:08:25] you know he
[1:08:26] the lord tested him
[1:08:30] he put him through many challenges
[1:08:34] but at the end he's the one that god
[1:08:36] gave the keys to the kingdom
[1:08:40] you know they called him the chief of
[1:08:42] the apostles amen
[1:08:45] but you know when you start looking at
[1:08:47] converted
[1:08:50] you know we got to start from the
[1:08:52] beginning
[1:08:54] you know many people don't understand
[1:08:58] then you come to church
[1:09:01] you we have a lot of new members that
[1:09:04] have started coming
[1:09:07] and the first thing they want to do they
[1:09:09] want to change themselves
[1:09:14] but that's not god's plan
[1:09:17] you know like our brother guadumo
[1:09:24] we accept that sacrifice that he made
[1:09:28] for us
[1:09:31] you know we accept the blood that was
[1:09:33] shed for us
[1:09:37] that's the first part of it
[1:09:39] because we're telling the lord lord i
[1:09:41] put myself into your hands
[1:09:46] lord you changed me senor kambia you
[1:09:48] know but many times the first thing we
[1:09:50] want to do
[1:09:53] i want to dress like the sister oh you
[1:09:55] make it
[1:09:56] i want to dress like the brother
[1:09:59] i want to act like the brother
[1:10:03] i want to be like this one
[1:10:06] and we began to be reformed
[1:10:10] instead of being transformed by him
[1:10:14] you know and many times even in the
[1:10:16] journey muchas vez is owning a hornet
[1:10:20] we forget about that
[1:10:22] we forget about the promise that we made
[1:10:24] with him
[1:10:27] we said lord i told you
[1:10:31] i made a vow with you
[1:10:33] that i was going to put myself into your
[1:10:35] hands
[1:10:38] when i came to you lord
[1:10:40] i was broken
[1:10:56] and we forget all about what we promised
[1:10:59] the lord
[1:11:02] but because we took the wrong steps
[1:11:07] the wrong steps to let god begin to
[1:11:09] change
[1:11:23] many times is a message like we just
[1:11:25] heard
[1:11:28] but we promised god
[1:11:31] when your word comes forth senor con
[1:11:34] i'm gonna open up my heart
[1:11:37] how many could do that tonight
[1:11:51] because that's what the disciples had to
[1:11:53] do okay
[1:11:55] you know many times we gotta confess
[1:11:57] with our mouth
[1:12:01] because when those words begin to come
[1:12:03] out
[1:12:05] that confession comes from somewhere
[1:12:07] it's a confession
[1:12:09] that comes from your heart
[1:12:12] and then it got to get put to action
[1:12:17] because you look at peter
[1:12:19] pedro peter was a tremendous apostle of
[1:12:22] god
[1:12:24] he loved the lord like brother said
[1:12:28] he would have killed someone for it
[1:12:31] because what was that greatest
[1:12:33] confession that he made
[1:12:43] and he says who do man say that i the
[1:12:45] some son of man amigos
[1:13:03] that
[1:13:05] but he says who do you say
[1:13:09] let's read that tonight
[1:13:12] matthew 16 13. matteo is
[1:13:19] and when it came
[1:13:21] and when jesus came into the coast of
[1:13:25] caesarea philippi he asked the disciples
[1:13:28] saying whom do man say that i the
[1:13:40] and they said some say thou art john the
[1:13:43] baptist
[1:13:44] some say elias some say others jeremiah
[1:13:47] or one of the prophets
[1:13:56] he said unto them but who do you say i
[1:13:59] am saying
[1:14:02] and simon peter answered and said thou
[1:14:04] art the christ
[1:14:06] the son of the living god
[1:14:11] you know and that was the confession
[1:14:13] church yes
[1:14:14] yeah but in verse 17 it reads like this
[1:14:16] and jesus answered and said unto him
[1:14:22] blessed art thou simon
[1:14:25] for flesh and blood hath not revealed it
[1:14:28] unto thee but my father which is in
[1:14:31] heaven
[1:14:39] and i say also on to the dower peter
[1:14:45] pedro and upon this rock
[1:14:49] i will build my church
[1:14:51] and the gates of hell shall not prevail
[1:14:54] against him
[1:14:58] so you you see
[1:15:00] he had to first confess it
[1:15:04] but after he confessed it
[1:15:08] it was so great
[1:15:10] that jesus says and thou art peter
[1:15:13] jesus
[1:15:15] something great because because you keep
[1:15:17] on reading what is this
[1:15:20] and the gates of hell peter
[1:15:35] we want to take the easy way out
[1:15:39] but when we get into trouble
[1:15:42] that's when we we expect god
[1:15:46] we don't ask god
[1:15:48] we don't ask
[1:16:04] because
[1:16:33] the into the john's
[1:16:38] and the matthews
[1:16:41] and we see many promises
[1:16:45] but we don't really
[1:17:02] but those words seem a lot simpler than
[1:17:05] what they are
[1:17:09] we got to start believe first
[1:17:13] because now we got to go organize
[1:17:16] [Music]
[1:17:28] unless the father showed me amenos
[1:17:31] so now we have to go through those same
[1:17:33] steps
[1:17:37] the plan was put there in plan
[1:17:39] he says i must go
[1:17:42] but i'm going to send you a company
[1:17:46] so when that cover comes
[1:17:49] he's got to dwell inside of you
[1:17:52] then you get put in the same place as
[1:17:56] jesus it is
[1:18:07] you see there basil it's so easy we
[1:18:10] presume a lot of times
[1:18:15] we venture without authority
[1:18:19] we want the same works that jesus did
[1:18:24] but we don't want to put ourselves in
[1:18:26] the same place that he was
[1:18:31] that i could do nothing
[1:18:34] unless the father showed me
[1:18:36] so you see here that peter with this
[1:18:38] confession
[1:18:40] [Music]
[1:18:53] many times like i said we don't want to
[1:18:55] confess
[1:18:59] and when the inspiration of the holy
[1:19:01] spirit is here
[1:19:05] to inspire you foreign
[1:19:10] god will make your body
[1:19:14] come into your confession
[1:19:18] okay church it's not
[1:19:20] your confession is different than mine
[1:19:22] john
[1:19:23] confession is different
[1:19:26] your walk is different than my wife
[1:19:29] your experience is different than mine
[1:19:31] experiences
[1:19:32] but god works with us
[1:20:02] he wants us
[1:20:40] [Music]
[1:20:57] but we're always trying to condemn
[1:20:59] somebody
[1:21:02] we talk about a message of love
[1:21:06] but can we really love somebody
[1:21:10] you know many times we say
[1:21:12] i love all my brothers and sisters
[1:21:16] here but it's also our obligation
[1:21:20] christians
[1:21:22] to love everybody
[1:21:24] where did jesus go
[1:22:12] and see why it's not functioning the way
[1:22:14] it should in our lives
[1:22:19] so after this confession
[1:22:23] and this is where i got the message
[1:22:26] i was reading the scriptures
[1:22:30] let me turn to luke 22 32. vamos a lucas
[1:22:34] bentidos
[1:22:43] luke 22 32.
[1:22:45] look at those
[1:22:53] i'm just going to read the last part of
[1:22:54] that
[1:22:56] so i want you to capture and
[1:22:59] and just remember he went
[1:23:01] and he said thou art the christ the son
[1:23:03] of the living god and faithful
[1:23:33] the art the christ
[1:23:37] the saint peter el mismo pedro was
[1:23:40] casting out demons
[1:23:46] and bragging about it
[1:23:49] but jesus said
[1:23:50] wait peter
[1:23:52] moment
[1:23:54] when you're converted
[1:23:57] strengthen your brother
[1:23:59] and that got me scratching my head
[1:24:04] maybe converted
[1:24:07] means a lot more than what i think it
[1:24:09] does significa
[1:24:12] significa so i go and i begin to
[1:24:15] search this word
[1:24:19] and it says many things but the one that
[1:24:22] caught my attention
[1:24:26] to cause to return
[1:24:44] look at all the miracles that happened
[1:24:46] in the old testament
[1:24:50] so at the end of the message i'm going
[1:24:52] to tell you the miracle that happened
[1:24:53] tonight
[1:25:09] like our brother said our faith gets so
[1:25:11] mixed up with everything
[1:25:20] but it says to return
[1:25:23] to bring back detroit
[1:25:52] so
[1:26:06] this is the evidence here church
[1:26:09] if you're converted
[1:26:12] you want to be changed back
[1:26:16] back to that condition
[1:26:34] is
[1:28:26] oh i hope you could
[1:28:30] hope to be a good actor for me today
[1:28:32] okay
[1:28:37] it's probably the best
[1:28:51] but anytime the bible says it twice like
[1:28:53] behold
[1:29:08] simon simon behold divo simon simon
[1:29:11] satan had desired
[1:29:36] this is
[1:29:38] jesus knew everything about
[1:29:41] jesus
[1:29:44] christ
[1:30:25] picture now
[1:30:44] now let me
[1:30:45] tell you my version
[1:31:00] peter pedro
[1:31:02] satan wants to sift you satan
[1:31:06] you know
[1:31:07] church thank you iglesia
[1:31:10] he loved peter
[1:31:11] pedro but now satan came
[1:32:52] peter
[1:33:06] he didn't know what the lord was doing
[1:33:11] for the third time
[1:33:14] do you love me
[1:33:17] he said you know i do lord
[1:33:36] so many times we don't think about the
[1:33:38] importance of our lives
[1:33:45] but god thinks highly of us
[1:33:56] you know many things happened before the
[1:33:59] holy ghost had even come
[1:34:01] on
[1:34:08] he said when the holy ghost
[1:34:10] or what the holy ghost was given for por
[1:34:13] la que puedo el espiritu santo
[1:34:18] was so that peter
[1:34:20] pedro could be converted
[1:34:23] he said he couldn't be converted
[1:34:27] until the holy ghost was given
[1:34:31] so you look and it changes the
[1:34:33] perspective
[1:34:36] it can be perspective because you go to
[1:34:38] john 14 12 again
[1:34:42] he that believeth on me
[1:34:58] pedro
[1:36:06] work that jesus christ did
[1:36:59] why would we forget that
[1:37:02] because that is going to be what
[1:37:03] produces the works
[1:37:15] but why shouldn't we
[1:37:17] die
[1:37:20] if that's what jesus created
[1:37:22] jesus we gotta see the same thing in our
[1:37:24] midst
[1:37:27] and it's easy yes
[1:37:29] it's so easy
[1:37:31] to put it off and make an excuse
[1:37:39] oh
[1:37:40] it's not just miracles it's other stuff
[1:37:43] oh no you got it hard eternal life
[1:37:46] i understand that's to me the most
[1:37:48] important is to impart eternal life
[1:37:53] but it also produces the works the
[1:37:55] miracles
[1:37:57] if you're sick
[1:37:59] there's no reason to wait
[1:38:02] there's nothing impossible for god
[1:38:05] if your life's in shambles just do you
[1:38:08] see
[1:38:08] if your life's tore up broken
[1:38:12] god can fix it
[1:38:32] this is our prophet the same holy spirit
[1:38:34] the prophet
[1:38:36] that save the lutherans
[1:38:39] that saint to fight the messages
[1:38:42] that baptize the pentecostals
[1:38:47] that's where many people finish their
[1:38:48] seven church ages
[1:38:52] he says now
[1:38:54] aorta set in an order
[1:39:12] a church an iglesia that draws the rest
[1:39:15] of them from the grave
[1:39:19] it's going to be so powerful
[1:39:24] what's happening
[1:39:39] as long as we let things come in front
[1:39:42] of us
[1:39:46] that coat will never come to pass
[1:39:49] that coat will never come to pass
[1:40:01] but then part of it is recognizing who
[1:40:02] your brothers and sisters are
[1:40:35] maybe you see it differently than i do
[1:40:39] but maybe your way is going to help me
[1:40:43] church we got to change iglesias
[1:40:47] as you stand to your feet
[1:41:28] i can't see my sister falling down
[1:41:43] i believe right now is
[1:41:54] but it's time to call upon him
[1:41:58] yeah many of us are in trouble right now
[1:42:09] but his presence is here if you need him
[1:42:11] this is
[1:42:27] but then i looked at the message i was
[1:42:29] bringing forth
[1:42:33] the lord how am i going to bring this
[1:42:34] message
[1:42:38] if i can't pull from your faith lord
[1:42:54] the god of your patriarchs lord
[1:42:59] lord they did all that without the holy
[1:43:01] ghost
[1:43:05] but it's been given in this last days
[1:43:40] whatever you need from the lord just
[1:43:41] reach out and and touch him tonight
