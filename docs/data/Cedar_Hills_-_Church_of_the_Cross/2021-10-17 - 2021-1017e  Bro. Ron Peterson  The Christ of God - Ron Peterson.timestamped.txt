[12:08] god
[12:22] i want to thank he and his family for
[12:23] their
[12:24] christian hospitality
[12:28] hospital
[12:29] and to all of you your warm welcome to
[12:32] you yeah
[12:32] [Music]
[12:35] pbs
[12:51] i want to be like
[12:52] timothy was to paul
[12:57] just put them in remembrance of what's
[12:59] already been said
[13:03] aren't you thankful to god that you have
[13:07] recognized your day and it's messy
[13:13] amen
[13:14] that your eyes have come open
[13:18] to understand
[13:23] amen amen let's turn in our bibles to
[13:26] the book of revelation chapter 19
[13:29] apocalypse
[13:36] revelations 19 verses 9 through 10.
[13:48] and he said unto me right
[13:51] blessed are they which are called to the
[13:53] marriage supper of the lamb
[14:00] and he saith unto me these are the true
[14:03] sayings of god
[14:08] and i fell at his feet to worship him
[14:14] and he said unto me see thou do it not.
[14:19] for i am thy fellow servant
[14:23] of thy brethren that have the testimony
[14:25] of jesus
[14:33] for the testimony of jesus is the spirit
[14:37] of prophet
[14:39] testimony
[14:43] if god were to do something in this hour
[14:48] if god were to fulfill prophecy
[14:54] the evidence
[14:55] that you have the spirit of god
[15:00] yes you would have the testimony
[15:04] of the spirit of prophecy
[15:08] you would catch what's being said
[15:19] so the testimony of jesus is the spirit
[15:23] of prophecy
[15:52] one of the two which heard john speak
[15:54] and followed him was andrew simon
[15:56] peter's brother
[15:59] uh
[16:07] he first findeth his own brother simon
[16:11] and he says unto him
[16:17] we have found the messiah which is being
[16:20] interpreted
[16:34] cry
[16:37] turn with me now to luke chapter 9.
[16:47] verses 18 through 21.
[16:49] there's
[16:54] and it came to pass as
[16:56] he was alone praying
[17:02] his disciples were with him
[17:06] and he asked them saying whom
[17:09] say the people that i am
[17:14] notice as he questions
[17:35] and others say that one of the prophets
[17:38] is risen again
[17:42] do you see all the interpretations
[17:49] and he said unto them but whom say ye
[17:51] that i am.
[17:56] and peter answering said the christ
[18:23] any man that has an education can read
[18:25] the bible
[18:38] it is hidden from the wise and prudent
[18:55] that we might know how to live a life
[18:57] that is pleasing to you
[19:02] or without faith
[19:04] it is impossible to please god
[19:35] the christ of god
[19:39] and i want to take a subject is we have
[19:41] found the cry
[19:48] now understand that the jews had the
[19:51] old testament teachings
[19:57] they had the bible in their day
[20:00] they had the teachings of moses
[20:04] and of the other prophets
[20:07] and
[20:09] we see that there was all kinds of
[20:12] interpretations
[20:16] of what god was going to do and how he
[20:18] was going to fulfill his word
[20:24] but we see that
[20:26] god
[20:28] is his own interpreter
[20:33] now understand that
[20:34] the bible says that in second timothy 3
[20:38] 16.
[20:43] all scripture is given by the
[20:44] inspiration
[21:00] just imagine the prophet isaiah
[21:06] how the anointing came came upon him
[21:10] behold the virgin shall conceive
[21:15] if he would have stopped and thought in
[21:17] his carnal mind he wouldn't have spoken
[21:23] see god's ways are above our way
[21:28] his thoughts
[21:39] and as they were moved by the holy
[21:41] spirit
[21:55] but when they were anointed
[22:00] amen even the apostle paul said now what
[22:03] i say this is me this is not the lord
[22:10] they ask brother branham things
[22:14] and
[22:15] you know in questions and answers
[22:18] uh he says now now look
[22:22] i'm going to answer this question
[22:24] but he says i don't have a word of the
[22:26] lord for this.
[22:32] he says now this is just me
[22:36] well i would rather take a prophet's
[22:39] opinion than my opinion
[22:45] now in second samuel 23 verse 2.
[22:52] the bible says the spirit of the lord
[22:55] spake by me and his word was in my
[22:58] tongue
[23:04] the spirit of that anointing gave
[23:19] and if he ever helps the people it
[23:21] wasn't him
[23:25] so many times people come up and say oh
[23:28] brother ron that was so wonderful you
[23:30] answered all my questions
[23:45] but as the anointing comes upon the
[23:47] menace
[23:50] sometimes he's answering a question of
[23:53] somebody in the back that has been
[23:55] praying
[24:01] somebody's been asking god for an answer
[24:06] and many times
[24:08] as we minister the word
[24:11] it's not me
[24:14] it's not brother caleb
[24:16] it's
[24:19] [Music]
[24:26] and the more that you have confidence in
[24:28] that
[24:30] gift the more you operate the gift
[24:36] you see if you pull he will preach
[24:41] he said if there's no pulling there's no
[24:43] preaching
[24:58] he says now
[25:26] listen to this exclusion it's my voice
[25:30] it's me boss
[25:32] and i'm listening to myself talk
[25:37] just as you're listening to me
[25:51] and he says
[25:53] when i'm under that anointing
[26:07] i asked brother billy paul
[26:11] because he told billy he said billy
[26:14] god's called you to work with me
[26:19] and you will know when i've been under
[26:22] the anointing too long
[26:27] he said so i asked him billy tell me
[26:30] what was it like
[26:34] what were the signs that you look for
[26:36] for your daddy
[27:18] if you leave me under the anointing too
[27:20] long i can't preach tomorrow night
[27:26] so he says
[27:27] he would come behind his daddy
[27:32] take his right hand and put it right
[27:33] here
[27:36] and if brother branham wanted to
[27:38] continue
[27:41] on
[27:42] brother branham would touch
[27:44] yeah
[28:00] you see him
[28:14] back
[28:16] and he's holding him up
[28:18] he reaches around and grabs the
[28:20] prophet's bible
[28:23] he lets the host minister know
[28:27] hello
[28:36] now listen to this this is a part that
[28:38] you never have heard before
[28:42] he says i would take daddy to the car
[28:44] and place him in the car
[28:49] he said many times he's so tired he
[28:51] would just lay down in the in the back
[28:53] seat
[29:10] i said
[29:18] [Applause]
[29:24] he kept
[29:36] [Applause]
[29:39] and he he would start crying
[29:43] he says oh billy
[29:46] i'm so tired
[29:48] take me home
[29:50] i don't want to preach no more
[30:02] and he says
[30:04] here billy he says i'm driving
[30:18] i want to go home
[30:22] and he says after about 20 30 minutes
[30:27] he would look in the rearview mirror and
[30:29] he would see brother branham sit up in
[30:30] the backseat
[30:45] [Music]
[30:47] he says i don't even remember what i
[30:49] said
[30:51] he says how many services do we have
[30:54] left
[30:56] he said we have three more services
[30:59] he says take me to the motel billy
[31:09] [Applause]
[31:15] you see when it comes upon a minister he
[31:18] speaks
[31:19] as the mouthpiece of god
[31:24] in the sermon the roman nobleman brother
[31:27] brenham says this
[31:29] is
[31:43] it was jesus christ using my voice
[31:48] and he says it depends on your approach
[31:51] to it
[31:55] amen
[31:57] it depends upon your approach to it
[32:02] and that's how it is even when you have
[32:05] a gift of god that's among you
[32:11] [Music]
[32:12] any
[32:40] ask abundantly
[32:44] have you ever gone to one of those
[32:48] help yourself buffets
[32:56] have you ever seen somebody go up there
[32:58] and they have one little plate
[33:02] and they just take a little bit
[33:06] and you know they get just a small
[33:08] serving
[33:18] and they bypass all of the
[33:22] they go for the meat
[33:25] they go for the good stuff
[33:30] and you know what it depends on how
[33:33] hungry you are
[33:37] if you're asking god god
[33:40] fill my cup
[33:44] i want you to i want you to feed me
[33:47] tonight
[33:50] i just don't want a small blessing
[33:53] i don't want just a little tiny blessing
[33:57] but i lose it before i get out of it
[34:04] but give me something that all next week
[34:10] i am still feeding on the world
[34:14] amen amen he says no he says in the
[34:17] sermon faith
[34:20] he says watch i am just yielding myself
[34:24] to the holy spirit
[34:27] and as i get myself completely yielded
[34:30] to the holy spirit
[34:44] [Music]
[34:46] l
[34:51] when brother branham would have the
[34:53] discernment and the prayer lines
[34:58] they always had the people come from the
[35:00] right
[35:03] because the angel stood to brother
[35:05] branham's right
[35:12] and as they approached the gear
[35:14] conformity
[35:38] now a prophet doesn't stay in just
[35:42] this present time period
[35:46] he can go back into time
[35:57] he says i see you as a young woman
[36:07] and he now begins to discern her
[36:13] and then he he comes out of this vision
[36:18] and he says are those things true
[36:25] that's the moment
[36:27] your husband is here too
[36:29] and he has something wrong with him
[36:35] and he the prophet said your prophet
[36:38] i
[36:52] to look over the
[37:04] that's why he said i can't stay under
[37:06] that anointing
[37:21] the bible says that whatsoever you yield
[37:24] yourself to you become the servant
[37:26] thereof
[37:34] either to righteousness or to
[37:35] unrighteousness
[37:39] it's a law of god
[37:42] do you not deceive god is not marked
[37:48] or whatsoever spirit you yield yourself
[37:51] to you become the servant thereof
[37:58] it depends on who you're yielding to
[38:01] todd
[38:21] why can you come how can you come to god
[38:24] and ask him to bless you and you're not
[38:27] you're not seeking him
[38:41] ask and it shall be given
[38:44] [Applause]
[38:54] you want more of god give more of you to
[38:57] him
[39:02] when when you pray do you know what it
[39:04] does to your spirit
[39:09] softens your spirit
[39:36] they called the prophet elijah hey come
[39:38] and give us the word of the lord
[39:43] and he says uh he says if it wasn't for
[39:46] this man i wouldn't even be speaking to
[39:48] him
[39:52] he said bring me a minstrel
[40:01] the right kind of music brings the right
[40:04] kind of spirit music
[40:08] hey man amen you and then listen it's
[40:12] pushing the wrong kind of music brings
[40:14] the wrong kind of spirit
[40:19] brother
[40:20] what kind of music your children listen
[40:23] to you
[40:26] he said without the holy spirit when
[40:28] they listen to rock and roll it catches
[40:30] their spirits
[40:35] i was driving in phoenix one day and i
[40:37] had one of the young brothers from my
[40:39] church in the car in front of me
[40:47] i could hear the music
[40:50] he's got
[40:55] [Music]
[41:04] and he
[41:08] [Laughter]
[41:17] i said yeah i was born at night but not
[41:19] last night
[41:24] it's whatever you yield yourself to it
[41:29] listen i can see all of you have a halo
[41:32] while you're here
[41:45] on your cell phone
[41:59] the word of the lord
[42:01] is used
[42:03] 234 times in your bible
[42:10] and i began to look this up
[42:14] the first time that it's used is in
[42:16] genesis 15.
[42:19] and it says in the word of the lord came
[42:21] to abram in a vision
[42:26] you see god making himself known to
[42:29] abraham
[42:33] and even
[42:34] the the next time i see it is in first
[42:36] samuel
[42:38] chapter 3
[42:42] the child samuel ministers before eli
[42:48] and the word of the lord was precious in
[42:50] those days
[42:54] and he
[42:55] eli went and laid down
[42:59] and now samuel goes and lays down
[43:04] and he hears the name samuel
[43:08] he hears a boy
[43:10] somebody's calling
[43:13] he runs the eli yes
[43:16] did you call me
[43:18] no no i i didn't go no you're not yummy
[43:22] because it lays back down
[43:24] but
[43:36] and the bible says in verse 6 and the
[43:39] lord called yet again
[43:49] and said here am i
[43:52] or thou didst
[44:05] neither was the word of the lord yet
[44:07] revealed unto him
[44:11] we see so much of the time that the word
[44:14] of the lord comes to once in the
[44:16] scriptures
[44:18] is
[44:22] and you see in the word of the lord
[44:24] comes to jeremiah
[44:30] and i told you that the correct word in
[44:32] hebrew
[44:35] it says the word of the lord became
[44:37] jeremiah
[44:41] do you know that god speaks in first
[44:43] person singularly
[45:01] i am going to speak to you
[45:05] i have heard thy prayer
[45:08] do you see what i'm saying
[45:11] it wasn't
[45:12] it wasn't isaiah
[45:15] it wasn't jeremiah
[45:31] sometimes people think that he that
[45:33] spoke it has got to do
[45:35] what the prophecy said
[45:41] god is his own interpreter
[45:50] i want to show you something go to saint
[45:53] john chapter four yeah
[45:57] san juan capitulo
[46:01] just have a little bible study tonight
[46:06] how many of you love to read your bible
[46:11] now let me say something about reading
[46:13] your bible
[46:16] do not read your bible like you read a
[46:19] book
[46:25] you must anoint the word first
[46:41] before you read your bible
[46:47] anoint the word
[46:49] father
[46:51] speak to my heart
[47:34] does christ come among us
[47:49] oh don't let church become common to you
[47:55] and the closer she got to him
[47:58] the more her heart just began to melt

[1:01:20] that was christ
[1:01:23] that was the anointing
[1:01:26] and brother branham i just heard it the
[1:01:28] other day

[1:01:35] with the pillar of fire that is
[1:01:47] israel was not following moses

[1:02:05] god

[1:02:21] that that angel was christ
[1:02:30] colossians 1 verses 25 through 29 in
[1:02:34] colossians
[1:02:37] wherefore i am made a minister according
[1:02:40] to the dispensation of god which is
[1:02:42] given to me for you to fulfill the word
[1:02:45] of god
[1:02:52] even the mystery which has been hid from
[1:02:54] the ages and from generations
[1:03:16] to whom god would make known what is the
[1:03:19] riches
[1:03:20] of the glory of this mystery among the
[1:03:22] gentiles
[1:03:28] which is christ in you the hope of glory
[1:03:31] is christ
[1:03:33] when we preach warning every man and
[1:03:35] teaching every man in all wisdom
[1:03:42] that we may present every man perfect in
[1:03:45] christ jesus
[1:03:48] jesus
[1:03:49] wherefore
[1:03:50] or where unto i also labor striving
[1:03:53] according to this working which worketh
[1:03:56] in me mightily
[1:04:07] galatians 2 and 20.
[1:04:24] how can you
[1:04:37] but christ delivereth in me
[1:04:40] [Applause]
[1:04:52] he wasn't
[1:04:56] [Music]
[1:05:04] [Music]
[1:05:06] he
[1:05:17] [Music]
[1:05:20] in the old testament
[1:05:33] do you know that the high priest never
[1:05:35] looked at the man
[1:05:41] he only looked at the lamb
[1:05:45] god's not looking at you
[1:05:48] he's looking at your lamb
[1:05:51] hallelujah hallelujah
[1:05:54] none of us are going to go to heaven
[1:05:56] because of our words
[1:06:00] none of us earned our way to heaven
[1:06:14] it wasn't anything you did
[1:06:29] when we get over there
[1:06:42] you do not keep god
[1:06:59] how many times have you made a mistake
[1:07:04] how many times did you do wrong
[1:07:07] and yet god still
[1:07:09] loves you
[1:07:22] when we look at moses and david and
[1:07:24] joseph when
[1:07:37] their lives
[1:07:38] are living out and expressing jesus
[1:07:41] christ
[1:07:46] he says why would you condemn me when i
[1:07:49] say i am the son of god
[1:07:54] when you call those who the word of the
[1:07:57] lord comes to
[1:07:58] god
[1:08:03] abraham was considered a god
[1:08:08] elijah was a god
[1:08:11] isaiah was a god
[1:08:14] because the word of god came to him
[1:08:20] when the man was anointed like joseph
[1:08:34] when david was anointed
[1:08:48] it was not david
[1:08:59] [Music]
[1:09:12] if everybody out in the world
[1:09:15] is looking more like their their god
[1:09:32] and we look at them they're getting so
[1:09:35] crazy
[1:09:39] but if they're getting more
[1:09:42] like the image of their god
[1:09:47] [Music]
[1:09:51] [Applause]
[1:09:53] let me ask you a question
[1:09:57] when brother branham looked beyond the
[1:09:58] curtain of time
[1:10:09] and he saw do you remember the vision he
[1:10:11] saw of the bride
[1:10:42] he says all my heart was so
[1:10:46] so swelling up within me
[1:10:51] he said here comes the modern-day church
[1:10:56] division
[1:11:08] all these years of preaching
[1:11:22] he says watch here comes the bride again
[1:11:36] i wonder how many
[1:11:37] within the message you're getting out of
[1:11:39] step
[1:11:42] and the prophet said get back
[1:11:49] it's your walk with god
[1:11:54] i want to ask you is your dress getting
[1:11:56] more holi
[1:12:00] or more like the world
[1:12:05] is the dress getting shorter
[1:12:16] you see holiness
[1:12:19] is not something you put on
[1:12:29] [Applause]
[1:12:34] modest
[1:12:47] because once you catch the revelation
[1:12:51] once you know it's wrong to cut your
[1:12:53] hair
[1:12:56] how many times do you have to be
[1:12:58] reminded
[1:13:00] no once they catch it i got it
[1:13:25] sometimes that's how the church does
[1:13:28] hey honey i got it
[1:13:58] all the years
[1:14:07] and yet there is still a small group
[1:14:11] hallelujah
[1:14:19] for the kingdom of heaven is likened
[1:14:21] unto a man
[1:14:24] who when he has heard the word applies
[1:14:26] the word
[1:14:30] but a foolish man is likened to one who
[1:14:32] hears the word and doesn't do it
[1:14:37] god help us
[1:14:40] to hear what god wants us to hear in
[1:14:42] this stage
[1:14:48] christ means the anointed one
[1:14:52] he says when a man is anointed by the
[1:14:55] spirit of christ
[1:14:59] his flesh being anointed with the spirit
[1:15:01] of god produces the word of god made
[1:15:03] manifesto
[1:15:24] brother branham said
[1:15:28] he says we don't judge one another
[1:15:32] but he says we can be fruit inspector
[1:15:39] you tell me you're an orange tree
[1:15:45] until i see orange fruit i don't believe
[1:15:48] it
[1:16:04] it is
[1:16:07] have we so reduced this message down to
[1:16:11] to laws and to regulations
[1:16:18] the
[1:16:24] listen i've been in the countries where
[1:16:26] the women wear a long dress
[1:17:01] you see it's it's not what you put on
[1:17:05] it's what you have on the inside
[1:17:13] hey man
[1:17:14] amen i've kind of bounced around here a
[1:17:17] little bit
[1:17:20] man
[1:17:26] brother branham said that we are
[1:17:27] messiahs
[1:17:44] when
[1:17:45] do you become a messiah
[1:17:51] i'm just talking to you right now
[1:17:54] yes brother
[1:18:04] but when you sit on the white throne
[1:18:08] with god
[1:18:12] and you have supreme knowledge
[1:18:15] and you were just like him he said
[1:18:17] and there comes up somebody
[1:18:20] before the white throne
[1:18:23] did you lie did you steal
[1:18:25] [Music]
[1:18:28] and under that great light you cannot
[1:18:30] lie
[1:18:34] and the voice was yes
[1:18:38] but there will be somebody on the throne
[1:18:43] my lord may i speak senor
[1:18:49] hallelujah
[1:18:51] they did something for my family
[1:19:00] do you mean to tell me
[1:19:04] that in a time when you
[1:19:06] are in need for even a cup of water
[1:19:12] the god could give someone eternal life
[1:19:18] because they gave you a cup of water
[1:19:37] [Music]

[1:19:54] and sometimes you want to pay him back
[1:19:56] and say hey
[1:19:57] and they say no no no wait we just did
[1:19:59] it
[1:20:31] i ask you how many of you can say the
[1:20:33] word of the lord has come to you you've
[1:20:36] heard the message of the ow
[1:20:42] you didn't go looking for it
[1:20:49] [Applause]
[1:21:07] [Applause]
[1:21:27] the bible says he that's forgiven much
[1:21:31] [Music]
[1:21:32] love
[1:21:33] i'm a muslim that's why i love him the
[1:21:35] way i do it
[1:21:39] because god forgave me
[1:21:58] [Music]
[1:22:17] showing us that listen every one of us
[1:22:19] are human beings
[1:22:25] we make our mistakes we do things wrong
[1:22:30] but we need god every day pero canada

[1:47:11] want to keep brother brother lalo
[1:47:13] uh sanchez and sister yolanda
[1:47:17] yolanda sanchez your mama passed away
[1:47:19] yesterday
[1:47:24] that god would comfort them the family
[1:47:26] during this time
[1:47:29] amen at the same token we want to
[1:47:31] congratulate
[1:47:32] brother david and sister lyanna and the
[1:47:35] baby boy that was born
[1:47:37] i believe on
[1:47:39] friday
[1:47:41] thursday and his name is
[1:47:44] brother david elisha
[1:47:46] so we want to also welcome him
[1:47:56] amen and uh last but not least uh i will
[1:47:59] be gone this weekend or this this week
[1:48:02] yes
[1:48:16] amen
[1:48:17] you know and and that's the thing that i
[1:48:18] really love you know sometimes we we get
[1:48:20] a lot of a lot of doctrines in the way
[1:48:22] and this and that
[1:48:25] every church has to have their doctrines
[1:48:29] but when that becomes a separating point
[1:48:34] if we become so dogmatic about something
[1:48:37] that it divides us with our brothers
[1:48:44] there's another spirit there i out
[1:48:45] respiratory you know it's like some
[1:48:47] sometimes
[1:48:49] we're here or wherever the lord lord has
[1:48:51] had us
[1:48:53] and it's like
[1:48:55] let me explain this
[1:48:57] i think many times people don't get this
[1:49:00] i think because you start fellowshipping
[1:49:02] or having fellowship with a certain
[1:49:04] brother or a certain church
[1:49:07] you have to turn your back on everybody
[1:49:09] you ever knew
[1:49:21] i wonder sometimes
[1:49:23] what message they read
[1:49:39] but then we get a little bit bitter
[1:49:40] towards the ones we used to know
[1:49:52] i hear the wrong no brother run
[1:49:54] out
[1:50:06] as i was saying to brother ron earlier
[1:50:09] sometimes we jump to the unity of the
[1:50:11] faith
[1:50:13] without first of all coming into the
[1:50:15] unity of the spirit
[1:50:19] we can come into that first century
[1:50:21] the rest
[1:50:22] it comes
[1:50:26] so when you see another part of the body
[1:50:28] and you meet another part of the body
[1:50:30] wow
[1:50:32] it makes you fall in love more and more
[1:50:35] with the lord
[1:50:39] that's why he's saying
[1:50:41] god would rather us love one another
[1:50:46] because he knows we love each other we
[1:50:48] love him
[1:50:52] one more time brother ron thank you
[1:50:53] again
[1:50:55] a blessing to us
[1:51:03] and that's the key brother and sister
[1:51:06] never ever let a root of bitterness ever
[1:51:09] come into your heart
[1:51:12] it'll choke the holy spirit out
[1:51:18] that's how
[1:51:31] it's been a wonderful
[1:51:32] sunday a wonderful day
[1:51:37] it's a time of refreshing that the lord
[1:51:39] gave us
[1:51:42] and i'm grateful to him
[1:51:45] almighty god
[1:51:50] oh lord how
[1:51:51] you know how to
[1:51:55] lord how you touch our hearts lord
[1:52:03] and the gratitude that we have lord is
[1:52:05] gratitude
[1:52:08] we seem to always
[1:52:10] fall short in our words lord
[1:52:15] but if we can say thank you
[1:52:18] from the depths of our hearts
[1:52:22] for thinking of us
[1:52:25] we're making us sons and daughters
[1:52:28] for
[1:52:37] lord i pray for brother ron that you
[1:52:39] continue to bless him and his wife peter
[1:52:41] ponos
[1:52:52] [Music]
[1:52:54] so that this word can go to so many
[1:52:58] different countries to so many people
[1:53:03] lord bless him i pray lord
[1:53:06] share of him lord
[1:53:07] his health lord jesus

[1:54:22] ask it all
[1:54:25] and amen god bless you until we meet
