said you better go get a you better go get a check by a specialist though because it could you know that could not be the case right around that time i was preparing to go to africa satan wanted me to just start thinking about that and fearing about that and i set the appointment with the specialists and for about a week i i all i did was kind of worry about that and i felt that something inside of me just said to rest on on these three words and it's i am here so i decided there i i forgot about it and i rested on that and this past week i had the meeting with the specialist and he confirmed that it was nothing to be worried about but god took it one step further and as he checked to see where it was god bless you amen thank you for the specialists to rachel brother justin for telling us and showing us what god has done in your life amen is is he great in our midst would you stand to your feet i believe we reach that most important part of the service where we are here to receive

[Applause] [Music] what we [Music] look what the lord has done amen god god bless you each and every one of you for the efforts that you have made and continue to make oh there he is come here brother brother will the will of sorrio come on up that's okay they all know you know yeah anyways so we're having a conversation and and he invited me for breakfast you know it's it's something when somebody talks to you and you have a normal conversation but you know many times many times someone can talk to you but never tap into into the gift that's before them [Music] and he said he he had on his heart to do something for the lord i i know that many of you all of you here would like to do something for the lord in one way or another how many of you would want to do something to to make a difference in your generation if it's to make sure that jesus christ and so as we began to talk i said i said uh i there's some inspiration that star began to come down there at the table and i said let me tell you this church that is not missionary minded will fail we are the church it's almost like and we are not missionary minded then we as individuals will fail so i said so you want to really do something for the lord i said well let's start something i have him here come up here okay so so we started something and uh and so uh you want to tell him or you want me to tell him yeah all right all right so so as we're talking and and then the lord says tell him tell him this i said you know we we take care of there's over 350 churches i said and it was it was a sad thing when we had the pastoral conference that so many of the pastors didn't even have a bible pastor how can you pastor without a bible without the word but can you imagine that we could take and give all not just the pastors but all their congregations bibles so we're starting a campaign there's so many people that don't even have bibles and in our homes we have lined up with bibles that we don't even use i asked him so are you are you up to the to the challenge he said he was i said now now there are 11 dollars per bible says we'd get a better price if we bought in more bigger quantities i said that that was my husband it's up to 11 million dollars does that does that shake you it's all it is yeah i said no don't don't ever look at it like that we are not moved by money no we are moved simply by god's word you know spirit that tells us and leads us to do what we do there is a purpose in this i propose i said can you imagine a million bibles i can you'll see and uh when we're done with the million we'll go we'll hit the 10 million there there he agreed to yes i'll take on the challenge people throughout throughout the world that you have come in contact with intel del mundo chaos no matter what country i said bring them on board i i kept let them tell their pastors and let them tell their their young people and let them tell whoever is like but we will get a million bibles thank you for taking on the challenge if you want to be part of the campaign amen there's what is 11 million dollars to the one that created everything how many so many stories we have with our father and brother bernie and going places with not a penny in their pot in their pocket santa's historias would you stand to your feet as we approach this message and uh and then i have a missed call from brother omar yes now if if you don't want to participate that's up to you but i get a call from brother omar yamada he's got this customer it's an older gentleman heard about what's going on in africa in africa and this is these were his words we're getting old we're just and so he says well i mean he said what do we have to believe like you to help you we believe that god sent a prayer he said what do you believe in well we believe god sent a prophet may jesus christ alive today christopher got him back on the scene and he says well even if i don't believe that brother brown was a prophet he said i can't deny the works that are being done at the same time i'm having this conversation brother and mars having a conversation with somebody that's i think i believe he's a baptist brother romano martin and how he begins to cry to see what the work's been done and my goodness we want to be part of really that don't matter what church you go to it don't matter at the end of the day brother braham says it's all about the blood test so anyways just let you know god will get it done he'll he'll get it done if we want to help help if we don't got to get somebody else to do it be fulfilled god bless you this morning now let's get into the word i hope you didn't you didn't put that towards my time this is now this is my time now right so this is the end number two number i'd like to put a subtitle evidential preaching uh we pray that this is a blessing to you we're going to continue what we started there in in what we started in or for easter almost continue let's see where the lord takes us this morning matthew the 24th chapter in the third verse like this and as he sat upon the mount of olives the disciples came unto him privately saying tell us when shall these things be and what shall be the sign of thy coming and of the end of the world amen may god add his blessings to the reading of his word you may be seated what a thing it is when when we see the disciples asking this question you know there's three questions here but you can see that that they're connecting a couple of things here that's enough to cause a lot of anxiety yes or yes clc how many are awake this morning make sure we're awake understand help your neighbor if he starts to knock off his neighbor that's enough to cause a lot of anxiety right coming to the lord the end of the world oh my goodness that'll get us going yeah one of the things that we as humans have is that we are very vulnerable we're vulnerable in a lot of ways i don't care who you are you're vulnerable in some way you are not strong in every way no no you're not we all have our strengths we all have our weaknesses we are human beings but there are many phobias that they call or fears that control the people and one of those fears or phobias is called doomsday phobias [Music] me and then they're going to her scaredy cat doomsday he's afraid of doomsday yeah as much as we might act like we're not i'm human beings there's always something there that's in the back of our mind that that worries us a little bit am i talking to anybody here yeah oh yeah yeah some okay some more honest some are not in in 1938 the the program and it was called war of the worlds it was broadcasted live and it was claiming that they were following an alien invasion in new york city i've ever heard of that in my life oh we've all heard about that like i said broadcasted live transmitting vivo there's aliens that have attacked the city now i believe it was orson welles it's such a good storyteller orson welles that it was as it was being broadcast throughout the whole united states people everywhere thought that this was really going on it caused mass hysteria and it showed how easily the masses can be manipulated we've seen that even through the pandemic right pandemia but but as you see this vest it shows that that the majority of the population in a moment's time can be swept up in a phobia now this is what we would call group thinking which is a documented phenomenon that occurs when when members of a group began to conform to the majority's opinion without critically evaluating information for themselves and we find that a lot nowadays is that right we don't check on things for ourselves that's why our founding pastor would always tell us but now that you've studied it there's nobody that's going to tell you that it's not true not a second-hand revelation revelation now think of this now because i remember when i was in in 1977 i remember that the big talk was the rapture is going to happen this year remember that yeah that would that was the big thing right and and and i remember i was only five years old and uh yet there was a certain fear a certain anxiousness yet a certain excitement that was in the air that was amongst all the message believers of that time how do you process as a five-year-old the rapture is gonna happen i've been processing that through all my life but but how do you really process that and when i look at the young people i see many times that there is that that bit of anxiety that that comes along with hearing the end well so i i entitled the message last time and then this time this is the end so i want to know what kind of feelings you get when i say this is the end let me see if there's a young person that that is it is valiant has enough courage to stand up and say this is how i feel that's embarrassing it brings a lot of anxiety the brother is he's honest okay does any one of you agree with that with brother will algunas we look at that and we say the coming of the lord should be the greatest event that we have ever ever even imagined yes and yet it's too many people a point of of of like i said anxiety and we don't know how to process it sometimes so we we we automatically in our minds automatically we associate when i say the end we associate it with the end of the world association and we are not creatures that are good with dealing with the inn because as creatures of time when we speak of the end we automatically think a termination have a little anxiety when you hear of the end or doomsday or the end of the world it makes us think no that's right first thing we think about pennsylvania and naturally as humans like i said we we always associate the coming of the lord associated ah okay they're even even the disciples are worried about it and how we feel towards those two events usually tied to how we think we're doing spiritually yeah because right away oh there's a war going on open thomas this could be it could be world war iii right we ask ourselves those questions so many times and not just how we are doing spiritually how are we doing carnally and it makes us check ourselves as to who's been winning lately the white dog or the black dog is negro who's got the upper hand in my life right now now this is is is where we're going this morning because the bible says in philippians 4 6. in philippines and i want to take it as i said as a sunday school here philippians 6 says be careful or anxious for nothing so i have to stop there and i have to ask you the question those of you that say you get a little anxiety when you think about those things the bible says be anxious for nothing don't be anxious for the coming of the lord where even though we're anxious for it to come but don't be anxious in that you're you're worried about it and don't be anxious about the end of the world how many would believe me when i tell you that believe me and i believe that the reason people are so fearful and anxious about these subjects because they don't know a whole lot about the subjects okay so now i'm going to have to ask you young people how many how many uh if i asked you what do you know about the seventh seal brother paul help me out here you know anything about the seven seal come on rooting for you okay somebody else want to help us without you that young lady you're a young man anybody wanting anybody know anything about the seventh seal again brother jimmy's like tell me how i'll preach from right here hold on hold on brother and that's what i'm talking about because we hear things all the same oh that's too deep no i can't even mess with it i don't even go there now let me ask you another question if i were to ask you what do you know about the coming of the lord what would your answer be my eye what do you know about the community anybody anybody want to answer all did anybody answer and what if i told you it's the same question yes my because the seventh seal is the coming of the lord i want you to follow me where i'm going because i i want to do the holy spirit wants to do away with this anxiety we don't know i don't know i don't know what's going to happen i don't don't get to be anxious for nothing he's trying to help you this morning same question will come yes and when he will come juan dobendra ah okay now now now let me ask you this question now okay i want you one of you guys to answer me you haven't answered a question for me yet no no man responded how many times did jesus come juantas versus viene es christo sister say it like you know it yeah three times christmas is that right okay i wanna know the three times that he comes somebody anybody wanna help me out i'm gonna get you young people and you can make sure you know what you believe go ahead right there on the tip here this first coming is that who come and he redeemed his bride amen ah okay because we got to understand then what coming are you talking about here's the the disciples saying what shall be the sign of thy coming he's like well i'm here right now and there's still two more comings i okay then the second coming somebody helped me so the first one was to redeem his bride the second one would be he's coming for his bride in a rapture now if you're writing notes write this down first to redeem his bride and now the third he comes with his bride as the incarnate god incarnate immortal incarnate incarnate we have to know these things how many got that so far i'll give you a chance to finish writing that because if i run and then you guys don't get it and what good is it that i'm up here preaching and got everybody excited and we were dancing and it was awesome all right so you guys got that hello all right let's let's go on then continue in verse 3 that's once again they're concerned about his coming and then about the end of the world i'm going to recap a little bit here jesus continues in verse 14. and he begins to refocus their attention to another end a otrofin an end that they're missing the point i wouldn't find on the list this is the whole this is the whole crux of the message now this message will take all the anxiety out of it but you gotta follow me pinch yourself because after about a few minutes 20 minutes 30 minutes you start to wander off and oh boy was looking at me yesterday hey gotta get your attention back again pay attention maybe i hit a wrong note but that's why we have the anxiety i'm nervous about everything okay we're this end now now this is verse 14 now and this gospel of the kingdom yes shall be preached in all the worlds or a witness what a testimony now this is what i said the other day i always my mind automatically did this then shall the end come in and i thought right away then shall the end of the world happen the gospel of the kingdom preached then the holy spirit says no yeah because as creatures of time [Music] what happens to my soul my spirit what happens to me is that the end of it ah here he here watch as jesus then is refocusing them to the end jesus because the end of the world that word as i said and would you put it up there it's soon to leia however you want to now pronounce it is the end of the world it is the entire completion or consummation of everything but jesus never said that when the gospel of the kingdom has been preached in all the world end of the world will happen there is an end that will happen before the end of europe and this end is what we are talking about today talks about the end or the telos how many know that that how many remember that what we talked about on easter now notice this now the endor talos is the end of some act in other words time continues but it's the last in any succession of series it is the point at which a time being can come into eternity this is a different end now i'm telling you watch this now which a thing is finished it is the end to which all things relate aim the purpose el the intentional actualization of potential or inherent purpose intentional the now this is why jesus is now telling them that the end of the world cannot come and he's telling them you're so worried about the end of the world and you should be worried about the end in all the world for a witness unto all nations and my question is why is there such a push today to stop preaching if god didn't call somebody to preach god bless them i'm not i'm not against anybody that don't preach but if you're called to do that the gospel of the kingdom has been preached in all the world then shall the end come in without preaching of the gospel there is no actualization of the divine purpose of god no actually i'll tell you why people have a lot of hard time nowadays with preachers right it makes them a good preacher but i want you to notice something it's not just about preaching no solo is the predicate because if it's sometimes we preach and we it's hard to get one person to come to the lord nowadays but i want you to get this this morning this gospel of the kingdom shall be preached esteban hello there i know this is what we would call evidential that can help take away the anxiety bring the people to an understanding we are not the same just as any anybody that goes to church god has a calling he's got a purpose even though an evidential preacher can get you excited there's a balance here now we understand that now watch this now it's not just that we're preaching because they think that because they have the books and the bibles and the tapes and all these things i'm not just talking about gospel i'm talking about evidential preaching evidence lots of preachers everywhere you turn but you can get any kind you may be giving the people the word he says watch where we're going this morning because the gospel is the power of god yes it is to make the word act what it says it will this is why we need evidential preaching right now we have heard it that's why such a tremendous thing that i had never seen before when three pastors were ordained as ministers of this end-time message in uganda the fields got their own little agenda doing their own little thing nobody cares about the harvest so much anymore oh whoever is going to come in is going to come in oh well what an attitude yeah if we could really understand what jesus is saying this because god don't see the end as an oh my goodness the end's coming finn we're supposed to think like him and yet we think like the world oh what's happening oh my gosh what am i going to do i'm worried all the time we said in church time after time the question is are you not getting the evidential preaching maybe we gotta bring it down a little bit more every attribute every thought that was in god from before the foundation of the world will come to its full and complete manifestation a complete manifesto in the end or the telos that's right first peter 1 10. now follow me from what i said from the very beginning follow it to right now as we keep continue on this he's not telling you to be worried about the ant the end of the world you got to get to perfection that's the end watch his first peter one let's go to let's go to verse 12. unto whom it was revealed that not unto i'm going to read it just in english to save a little bit of time unto whom it was revealed that not unto themselves but unto us they did minister the things which are now reported unto you by them that have preached the gospel unto you with the holy ghost sent down from heaven which things the angels desire to look into what are the angels desiring to look into que de san ver los angeles they could just see what was in that what's in that heart but this is what i want to get to verse 13. wherefore gird up the loins of your mind or just letting the wind just take you from here to there and i'm worried i'm anxious and i'm depressed and i'm everything else gird up the loins of your mind you get me young people look look at the coins of your mind because your redemption is to the end of the world no to the end i like this hope to the end for the grace that is to be brought unto you at the revelation of jesus christ it's not a mystery no more mysterious what was once a mystery has now been opened when mysterio so don't be fearful or anxious wait with joy and full confidence for your perfection your maturity your completeness that is revelations 22 16 apocalypses he says i jesus your jesus have sent my angels to testify unto you i don't think we understand sometimes how great a message that we have recently i jesus have sent mine angel jesus to testify unto you testimony brother branham interprets the word testify there he says i jesus have sent mine angel to vindicate oh come on church i sent my angel to vindicate it unto you vindication is the evidence of the preaching that we are supposed to be doing his imputation this message is incredible and there's so many today's oh this message is that we have evidence now i don't know about you but we've got evidence here that's the message that was brought to us by the seventh angels to regain possession of what was ours from the beginning of the principle why jesus never gave us our inheritance god gave us our inheritance before the foundation while he was here on earth when he ascended on highs then he comes back regresa the son of man is revealed again revealed again what does he do he goes and now this this gets personal with you and the lord hello that's an invitation this vindication that the angel brought will defend you against any opposition we know we lived when the message of this angel has found its place in you there is no reason to worry about the end christ in us is i don't know how to make it any planer i am alpha and i am omega alpha omega i'm the beginning put on that clip if you don't believe me here's another there's another preacher in spanish it's always masculine when you go live when you go learn spanish it's always feminine now i do don't want you to to to get the scripture out of context because only jesus solomon jesus is the i is the alpha and the omega alpha omega that is his attribute is the song if glory gloria i could get the microphone and drop it and say god bless you well they had a microphone that's enough right but what a statement go back i i tell you go back and hear that again like yes good the tommy junior in in the message alpha and omega tommy jr wonderful matthew 24 14 is evidential preaching can only come by the message of this angelo but god sends a prophet signs and wonders are given to that prophet to vindicate his ministry number three then the word of god comes to the prophet and the prophet vindicates that word a prophet is a revealer of the word that's written oh come on is that anybody here come on now there has to be a people then that are born of that word said mano i thought that only god that god only vindicates his prophets prophet let me tell you no no he wants to vindicate you too el steele he already proved that brother branham was a prophet who wants to say he's not he's not the prophet but i think is looking up yes i don't care what anybody has to say but he's already been vindicated but here's the problem okay and i'm just giving you the problem but i want to give you the answer too let's wait a little question it's easy to find out what the problems are this is wrong in the church and this is wrong about it and talking about it with each other shame on us when we do that our little clicks in our little groups don't even get me going right now in that one [Music] you say brother as the product of that word here's a pear that's an orange tree like a stone i can't vindicate that nope no oh here's the new birth at the revelation of jesus christ watch what he says here in the message he must be born again if you can put it up there and and mental is necessary when you're born again not that's how god vindicates all of his nature that's the way he vindicates his ministry is a minister all of his servants are vindicated the same way he vindicates nature how how do you know he's a teacher because the word comes from him how do you know he's a prophet the word comes through him vindication it proves itself indication but as the generations pass and here's where we come into a little problem here generations pass little by little forget poco had sent a vindicated that was brought through that prophetic he began to forget about the prophet and his message and now everything sounds good it's easier to get on tick mas facidentara tick-tock and listen to 30 seconds of a preacher going to town oh man he's got the anointing hello everybody i listened to over here when i just got at the oral roberts and the billy graham or robert that's the congratulational seed that's a pentecostal scene it'll grow watch it it's going to grow but the word see will also grow i jesus has sent mine angel jesus not a bunch of preachers no no and because people began to lose sight there's a lot of truth in those things i'm not i'm not against them but you don't understand this you say well why do you bring it up so much because it's a it's a subject that's ongoing they're my brothers i'm not against them we should hear more get back to the hearing the message of the hour evidential preachers therefore now i may make a lot of people even in the message throw up for this it was good until that point therefore that word esta must be re-vindicated you might not like that god already vindicated the pride he don't need to be revindicated give me a chance to say what i got to say well they're choking out they're working to be drinking so good i wish i could give you all some but if you need some acidic just raise your hand say dick and i need some water yeah i don't know about this re-vindication thing i'm not saying that you have to go re-vindicate who brother no watch how i'm saying this that's the only way to re-vindicate it god he is the god of brother all these precious brothers that gave their life el dios estos hermanos got to be vindicated in our day now because then all they have is just stories continue that they not for us just to sit down and say wow that was tremendous i'd use them we would not be where we're at without oh can i have like 15 minutes i don't know how long but but let me let me get this okay this this is just tremendous to me it's up to us it's depending on the evidential preaching evidence then you and christ are one god and christ are one himself alive after 2000 [Applause] now once the angel has vindicated what jesus said it's our turn to vindicate what we have heard oh it's a good message brother hermano good piece of meat you manifest or is it just a good message we're not the people had to believe what moses spoke but then it was up to the people to vindicate or produce a claim of what moses had says that it was of god this is what he told the man to brother omar i hope i get it right omar you believe that message chris you cannot deny what you all are doing not what it has been no pues these great men left the legacy i remember when it was so dark it seemed when my father got sick i said this is the past this is the end it was pretty much the end of my world era but it was not the end yet you know why because i had to do the same thing in my generation i thank god for a good wife your father poured into you your brothers the church the ministers what's for you raise your hands it's done that's it i don't believe that she says here i am macho man woman talk
