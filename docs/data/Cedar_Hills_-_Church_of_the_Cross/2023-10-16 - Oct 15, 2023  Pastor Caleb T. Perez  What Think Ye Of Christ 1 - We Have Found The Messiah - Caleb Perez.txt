chance at the word but uh the Lord changed changed my thinking we we uh we're gonna start a series entitled what think ye of Christ help us and we have sister Ramona here too I almost didn't see her God bless you Sister all the way from from Louisiana louana good to be good to have her her in our midst amen anyone else visitors may God bless you but uh let let's get into the word and um I I I want to read the scripture and then um I have a little video here for you all um of a a brother that we met in Israel last year pastor of a little church he said brother Morton we were asking about him and he sent brother Morton a little uh a breakdown a little report of what's going on over there in in Israel so we just wanted to play that for you amen amen so if we can if we if you can be so kind just real quick to Matthew the 22nd chapter and the 41st we're we're going to read just the 41st and 42nd verse here when you have it you can say Amen amen and while the Pharisees were gathered together Jesus asked them saying what think ye of Christ who son is he and they say unto him the son of David they got out his blessings for the reading of his word you may be seated and uh we're going to ask them if they would put that video up hi friends a short update today we took back control of the surrounding towns around Gaza many tanks have lined up around Gaza to enter by ground Invasion 300,000 Reserve soldiers have been called up and going into Gaza and North to Lebanese border almost everyone has a family member or dear friend going in Rockets from Islamic Jihad and Hezbollah in Lebanon and Soldier infiltration into Israel the Israeli Defense Force has made it clear they are going in to completely destroy Hamas no matter the expense of the hostages 900 plus Israeli casualties total but it is almost certainly much bigger many hostages some of which are British and American citizens Hamas Rockets landed also in the Arab areas such as Bethlehem and mosques the northern border towns have been ordered into shelters today Believers at the moment are all okay many are waiting at any moment to be called into service today we bought some supplies for soldiers and the sense of heaviness dread and emergency as such that has not been felt before in Israel many are shutting themselves in their homes and creating in homemade door jams from wood and metal pipe to effectively lock themselves in the bomb shelter the home front command has ordered all residents to have 72 hours of emergency supplies and be ready we greatly appreciate the prayers and support at this difficult time we know he who keeps Israel is not asleep God bless you brother fiser [Applause] at this at this point there is nothing else to to trust in amen he who keeps Israel is not asleep what a statement as this war started in Israel I have been asked of course many times by many people of course what I think about it right everybody's looking to see well what's going on and where do you see this going and so forth but I try to always look at what's going on around the world always in the scope of the scriptures and through the scope of the message of the hour I don't believe that we can ever understand truly what is going on without understanding the message and the scriptures because without this we would be like anyone else we would be afraid we would be fearful for our lives but as I was reading this and I began to and I just want to put a foundation today on this message building next next Sunday we'll we'll we'll start getting into it a little bit deeper but as we see this and he asked the question that that was very hard for them to to really understand because the way that they view this question they had their minds made up already of what they believed it was what think ye of Christ can you just maybe for a moment just ask your neighbor that question just ask your neighbor neighbor what think ye of Christ the question was asked to the Pharisees and now the question is asked to each one of us whose son is he that's a good one because it put them in a precarious situation they say unto him the son of David so when we look into the Greek we see that Christ uh in the Greek is Christos I think it's up there yes Christ is Christos Christos which means the anointed one or the Messiah in other words what he was asking them what do you think about the anointed one what do you think about Messiah and so he's asking this religious group it would be the same as if he were to ask the rabbis today I believe that they would give the same answer that they gave back then what do you think of Christ well whose son is he he's the son son of David we begin to understand more as we as we get into the message and I began to see this message in a way that I had never seen it before we can very easily we get into the message and and we we hear it Christ is the mystery of God revealed and it's easy to give that answer my question this morning then would be is Christ still a mystery he preached this message years and years ago but we ask the question again is he still is Christ still a mystery maybe to many people he's not a mystery no more if it's been revealed to them but to many many people Christ is still a mystery the Messiah is still a Myster when we look into the message and it tells us that all that God was he poured into Christ then Christ has got to be the the center of everything you'll never understand the mystery of it you never understand who God is without understanding Christ because as brother bradam says in the message he says why why God or Elohim was so great he covered all Space and Time and Eternity he said that he was too mysterious for for us humans to ever understand him how could you understand a a a being that that has had no beginning has no end that covered everything how could you understand that so then the only way that he could express himself we know this we've heard this many times he had to express himself in Christ brother brandham says that Christ is the logos of God can you repeat that after me today Christ is the logos of God don't forget that now Christ must be the center of everything that we do he's got to be the center of our whole lives you believe that all right God had a three-fold purpose can you somebody help me with them well they put it up there and they took it down let's see if our young people know what the three-fold purpose real simple somebody help me out what was the first as we as as we know through life there's a purpose behind everything and that's what we're all we're trying to find out if you're going through a hard time what's the purpose we get so stuck with I'm going through a rough time brother that we never find out the purpose why the rough time came maybe you're struggling with something what's the purpose of it if we don't know the purpose we're always going to be on the on this side of the fence and complaining why we have it the worse than anyone else then to begin to understand God a little we have to understand Christ because there's a purpose why God was doing everything that he's doing the whole plan of God there's a purpose behind it if you catch the the the the plan and what it purpose is there's no reason to freak out when there's a war when there's when there's things going on in this in this world so somebody want to help me out here first the young people come on help God had a three-fold purpose and later on as we get into these messages we're going to find out how this threefold purpose is goes perfectly with the with the three parts of the seven seal but that's just for you to think about I won get there today but number one somebody help me say it out loud if you in first there you go all right we got one over here so number one it's was to reveal himself in Christ everybody in agreement there that was the first thing that was the first purpose you can't find no other purpose if you don't get the first purpose because then you're going to be looking for something else but no no no no you've got to catch it in the order that he gives it number one was to reveal himself in Christ okay number two come on dig deep dig deep on this how how do you even H how can you even know what your purpose is without knowing that God God had a purpose doing what he did you got to find out what his purpose is and in that purpose is where you find your purpose so you got to know these things redeem us yeah but but a little bit more specific that's that's part of the whole plan that's a good answer but but but after revealing himself in Christ Christ his next purpose was to somebody alen okay brother Jim let him amen right number two write these things down you're not going to find purpose without this so number one to reveal himself in Christ to have preeminence in his bride the body of Believers and number three this is the three-fold purpose everything is found in this purpose last one somebody that's all that's in the preeminence what's the third one but good that you try come on somebody nobody has ever read Christ is the mystery okay let let me see how many of you have read Christ as the Myst now now this is a church of Believers of the message I believe brother Ram how many listen to the messages how many have read the message Christ is the mystery of God revealed you can't even fathom this great Elohim without understanding this I'm telling you go home this week and read and hear this message over and over and over again I don't remember how long it is but it's it's it's it's long so what all right all right am the last one is what restom is to restore the kingdom restore us back to Eden okay so everybody got this got to know these purposes number one reveal himself in Christ if that's all I did was go over this and over and over with you today and I I think we we we we will have made some progress to reveal himself in Christ to have preeminence in his bride his and to restore the kingdom then we can now see then what God is doing we cannot look at God's people and the events that surround them without seen them through the lens of God's word without seeing them through the lens of the purpose that God has if I try to understand the the the the modern events made clear by prophecy but I don't see it through the lens of Christ is the mystery never understand the events all I will do is is become afraid every time 's a war and what's going to happen and oh my goodness what will put on the mind of Christ first that's what we are called to do put on his mind first because in his mind we find purpose in his mind we begin to understand what these attributes that were in God we know that then that there is an eternal etal purpose of what is going on here we all know that God or that Israel is God's people amen that's something we've we since we were babies we we understood or we we knew and knowing this then we know that those that bless Israel would be blessed those that cursed Israel will be cursed also we also know that the Jews or Israel is God's time piece so we watch them and especially anything that goes on with Israel the whole world takes note what's going on oh because we just know that there's prophecy being fulfilled whenever this war broke out we we we began to it brings back our understanding of what we've learned about Israel there is roughly 16 million Jews in the world today we know that Hitler killed about a third of them in the 1940s they say about 51% of them live in North America and between 35 and 40% live in Israel now we also know the scripture says that not all Israel is Israel and and and we see that through through many things and I I don't want to get into details right now but we we see that this war started uh uh last weekend it was exactly 50 years after the yam kapor war in 1973 and they say that this is the deadliest or it was the deadliest day for the Jews since the Holocaust so so as I see this unfold and and we all are witnesses to this it brings us then to an understanding of of of or or it causes us to dig deeper into the word things come up because we got to dig a little bit deeper we always look at Wars as oh it's far away it's in Israel and Ukraine and the other side of the world and yet with us we have become so comfortable in our lives we we we don't know what it is to be out to be to be fearful of a rocket hitting or or bombs dropping but believe me our time is coming when I say our time I'm talking about as a whole we don't know what it is really to suffer heartaches we've had hard times I'm not saying it's not rough and we understand that we have a war going on which is which is a spiritual war but if I'm going to understand what's going on I've got to go back to the scriptures Luke the 17th chapter and the 26th verse I just want to read just the very first few part the first part of this scripture we're in Sunday school and I want you to learn this okay now I'm going to hold on what was the first purpose had reveal himself in Christ number two you have preeminence in his bride number three or the kingdom okay make sure you're learning tonight today you just want me to preach 100 miles an hour huh no no we're in Africa and we had jumped and shouted all weekend long Sunday morning comes and our pastor founding Pastor he he gets up and he says all right dancing and shouting you haven't learned nothing now sit down and listen I'm going to give you Doctrine you ever seen the most the quietest group of Africans you ever seen but they learned as it was in the days of Noah let's go back and find the condition there just real quick cuz I'm going to get into the to my message but I want to I want to tie this in let's find out the condition in the times of Noah we always go through the same thing yeah in time of L and and there are all these you know homosexuals and D we we can we can go down that road but but I'm going to go down a little bit different road today Genesis 611 now we want to tie this together because there's a purpose for this the Earth also was corrupt before God and the Earth was filled with violence God looked upon the Earth and behold it was corrupt for All Flesh had corrupted his way upon the Earth and God said unto Noah the end of all fleshes come before me for the Earth is filled with violence with violence through them and behold I will destroy them from the earth this is not coincidence if you notice those two verses the first and the last one did you that it used the word violence twice anybody as it was in the days of Noah there was violence if you go into the Hebrew the very word violence isas okay do I have your attention now all right now this is what's going on here that's why we're trying to find how things connect no no no the Holy Spirit already has told us the very word violence in Hebrew is Hamas which means cruelty false Injustice oppressor unrighteous now if you take the the the the same word into the Arabic Hamas means brave and courageous well it depends on what side of the fence you're on that's whether you're seeing somebody Brave and courageous or if you're seeing an oppressor someone that brings violence now notice this now remember keep in mind God's purpose of revealing himself Ephesians 311 tells us according to the Eternal purpose which he purposed in Christ Jesus our lord then in Luke 218 he says take heed that ye be not deceived for many shall come in my name saying I am Christ I am the Messiah and the time draweth near go ye not therefore after them they're claiming now that Messiah is could be there in Israel already because there's a certain Rabbi who has they say has done certain Miracles right keep up with these things what do we do with our time we're a people prepared for a Rapture right my goodness when and what will it take for God to get our attention we have become so Earthbound so carnal in the way we think and the way we do things that we become million miles from where we need to be God have mercy anyways there's this there's a rabbi that they say he's done many miracles and they say this he could be the Messiah no no there are things that have to happen there are two prophets that need to come on the scene there's much more so when you try to put the card in front of the horse can it doesn't come out right because that's not the purpose there's a purpose where with Christ is what is who is revealing this unseen this invisible God and ye shall be betrayed verse 16 by betrayed both by parents and Brethren and kins folks and friends tell me it's not a day we are betrayed by friends yes amen we don't like to hear those things because we like to play two sides both sides of the fence you'll answer one of these days I'm not talking about taking sides with people you catch the spirits coming bouncing back oh he wants us to take side no you take sides with the word is the anointed word of the hour but the question is how have you answered what think he of Christ well we're going to get into something good here in a moment but there's so the atmospheres are so full of devils right now we got to clear out the atmosphere first you'll be betrayed by kin folks and friends and some of you shall they cause to be put to death and you shall be hated of all men for my name's sake oh brother that's that's Israel that's Israel in the natural remember Israel parallels the church but there shall not an hair of your head perish he just said some of you will be put to death and then he turns around and says but not a hair on your head will will perish could put to death get out of hair in your head watch this now in your patience though in your patience possess ye your Souls it's in your patience that you will save your soul this this scripture is tremendous there is no other nation that has ever been dispossessed of their native land and still maintain their identity no other no other nation has this ever happened to once again no other nation that has ever been dispossessed of their native land maintain their identity except Israel Jacob went off to Egypt and they returned during The Exodus then they were carried off to Babylon for 70 years they get their land back during the times of the Persians then they were scattered throughout the world by the Romans and supernaturally trumpet sounded and they returned to their Homeland and still recognized as a nation with their own flag their own money their own language still with their own identity there's some theology out there that's called replacement theology that states that the Jew has completely passed off the scene of Bible prophecy passed off the scene of Bible prophecy and that anything in the Bible that's after the time of Christ it's only talking about spiritual Israel but watch what Paul has to say in Romans 11 verse 1-5 and then 25 I say then hath God Cast Away his people God forbid for I also am an Israelite of the Seed of Abraham The Tribe of Benjamin was go God hath not Cast Away his people which he forew watch ye not what the scripture saith of Elias how he maketh intercession to God against Israel saying Lord they have killed thy prophets and dig down thine altars and I am left alone and they seek my life but what saith the answer of God unto Elias or unto him I have reserved to myself 7,000 men who have not bowed the knee to the image of ba so then at this present time and I'm going to say at this present time there is a Remnant according to the election of Grace even though they're still under the law but Grace is coming to them the message of Grace that we have received that's in the purpose that's what God from before the foundation of the world he knew he would have a people no matter what they would go through he's telling you here even at this present time there is a Remnant according to the election of Grace watch 25 for I would not Brethren that ye should be ignorant of this mystery lest ye should be wise in your own conceits arant that blindness in part is happened to Israel until the fullness of the Gentiles be in you can see that Satan has always tried to eradicate God's people but praise God for Grace well well then they asked well brother Caleb what do you see in this conflict in this War I want you to hear closely so you can know what brother Caleb what I believe to me this war this conflict this war that's going on there's a purpose behind it and the purpose is to for them to open up their minds and their hearts so that they can ask or answer the question what think ye of Christ they have not been able to answer that question they did it and they said oh he's the son of son of of of Abraham or of David he's the son of David yeah they gave an answer but that answer was not correct it was partially correct because they were they they were blinded in part so according to the to the Natural they they said it right but they could not see farther than that that's where we're at we can see to a certain point and we just seem to we can't seem to see any farther than that listen listen to this closely pray that you get this now the purpose of this is because it is it is causing Israel notice how important this is it is causing them to ask the question what have we missed oh come on every one of us it makes me to look back in the scriptures and the message and say what did I miss I'm many of you ever stop and and ask yourself the question I missed something you got to you got to ask yourself constantly what did I miss something if if I continue to be sick and sick and sick I got to ask am I missing something come on chch you got to wake your yourself up H your conscience this morning ask the question have I missed something that's the purpose that I see of this war as the Gentile dispensation is coming to a close God doesn't deal with both at the same time so as it as as our dispensation is coming to an end he's beginning to turn back to the Jews then they have to be in the right frame of mind what think ye of Christ have we missed something is there something that we've overlooked notice this now what are we missing Nations and armies rising up against them to annihilate them we see the end of the Gentile dispensation quickly approaching but I will say this their salvation is in answering the question why are we going to look everywhere else brother what's going to happen they need to answer the question and every one of us need to answer the question what think ye of Christ I know Christ as Jesus Christ lived 2,000 years ago no no no what think ye of Christ because he's the same yesterday today and forever you might think of him as in yesterday but what do you think of him right now in your day come on Church B yourself what is he today ah let's find this out they cannot answer this question until two prophets arise arrive on the scene my neighbor was asking me the question couple days ago tell me what you see in this when I finished with him he just said forgive me the expression but this is what he said you just scare the hell out of me every and I said good that's what I'm trying to do that's where the world is at fearful but what is there to fear the only thing we should fear is that we're not ready we're stuck in our own mind our own concept of what we think the message is there is an eternal purpose behind it all I can't look at a war I can't look at at what's going on in with with this AI yeah artificial intelligence I can't see all the violence that's going on if I just look at that why I'm going to be a nervous in a nervous condition but when I look at it through the lenss of of the very purpose of what God had in his mind and it's now revealed oh it takes me to another level here we we we we can't stay living down here we got to come up a little higher we've got to understand and be aware of the Eternal purpose and the timing of all these things watch what is going on stop for a moment because if you don't follow this you're going to get bored that's the way we I have to tell people sometimes hey maybe I had to pass some some mirrors around that's right do you know how you look sometimes really do you know how you lookes you get more excited when you go to McDonald's get a Happy Meal Happy Meal W but you give life to people what do they do amen I don't feel like being here listen to this I I I pray that the Holy Spirit puts this all together for you it's very important to understand the the Eternal purpose notice what's going on I didn't ask the Lord to go to Norway or to go to Poland or to go to Africa but there was pool why was there a pool I don't know at first I was like what am I doing here what am I going just for that people oh look at the brother goes to all these countries if that's my purpose my goodness I missed it a million but I want them wherever we go I want them I want that wherever we go I want them to begin to see the Eternal purpose scriptures being fulfilled the message is being fulfilled what what is really going on the gospel is going back to the east I don't know why I was there until he begins to show the purpose why he's p pulling us there I I I am I am a a servant of the Lord I am a prisoner where he pulls me that's where I go civilization traveled with the Sun from the East to the West he says we're on the west coast now East and West has met can't go any further sin has traveled with civilization yet every thought of man is continually evil it's just like it was in the days of Noah and we've come back to that time yet again the Eastern people received the Holy Ghost first civilization always travels with the Sun and so has the gospel traveled with the Sun but now we are realizing there's no place to go except back to the east oh come on Church you got to get this now there's nowhere no nowhere else to go we went as far west as we could go now he's pushing us or calling us back oh the word has gone around the the globe but here's our pastor and he says yes the word has but what about the [Music] gospel because the gospel did not come in word only but in the power and the demonstration so then the word is there so many people don't know know what to do with the word so what what what needs to happen the gospel s got to sweep back to the east to get to get back where to the place it first fell in Jerusalem this is all a setup I'm telling you it's all a setup it's all everything that goes on it's the plan of God no notice this now how many are with me once again while the Pharisees were gathered together he asked them what think you of Christ whose son is he he saith unto them how then this is verse 43 how then do David in spirit Lord saying the Lord said unto my Lord sit thou on my right hand that's a hand of power or opposition of power till I make thine enemies thy foot stool if David then call him Lord how is he his son how is a father GNA tell his son my Lord capital L that doesn't even seem possible and he's telling them how if David called him Lord how is he his son and no man was able to answer him a word neither D any man from that day forth ask him any more questions just by asking them one question what think he of Christ we have our our hands full with this subject now I'm going to get into this to this subject now what think he of Christ ask yourself right now what think you of Christ and we better be able to answer this question because our Salvation is in this question oh come on I got to tell you again our salvation is in this question we can say a lot of things but our lives our actions our speech tell the real story of what we really think of Christ I'm getting to something now I'm I'm just I just just putting a foundation here if Jesus Christ the God man that lived 2,000 years ago was standing right next to you right now right at this very moment he was sitting next to you would you act any different than what you're acting right now on now what do you think of Christ it tells what you think when we come to church look at them see who else I can talk about you you haven't answered the question what think you of Christ would you act different right now if he was sitting right next to you the question is for every one of you would you worship any different if you knew that he was standing next to you oh come on come on church this is what I'm talking about Christ is simply a fairy tale simply someone that lives way out in there way out somewhere in space it's someone that we are not conscious of the presence of the Lord in our midst that's why we we freak out with everything that's going on we don't need to freak out no more we need to become conscious that Christ is the mystery of God revealed and I can answer whose son is he a I got to answer and every one of us has to answer this question how would you talk standing right next to you that brother it would be an instant stop I don't like that that's right amen amen yes sir would we would we be nervous if he was standing next to you would we be sick if he was next to us come on church it's just the realities of this now I I I'm so done with with it's it's just like he's far away and we preach and we preach and wonderful messages everything good I'm not I'm not throwing against but but I I I need more right now we need more than than what we have seen what we what we know we already have the mechanics we have the theology we can tell you everything that the messenger says but we need the Dynamics now we need the Dynamics to take the mechanics and make those mechanics do something that it says it will do we have not recognized that we are the Temple of the Dynamics Hallelujah and our children and all we do is yes yes the problem is is that the question hasn't been answered Christ amen oh this this message won't make me popular I don't really care I'm not trying to be popular as the pastor I have a responsibility to get you prepared for the rapture if you went home after service and you knew he was in the car with you and you got home would you change your routine of the things that you do would you or not yeah I'm going home get food back back and and then I don't know go off and see somebody and see what I can find out do would you change your routine would you still visit the same sites on your phone if he was standing [Music] next would you TR try and fight off those bad thoughts or would you allow them to dominate you if he was standing next to you come on my subtitle is we have found the Messiah get to something here you were sick would you ask him to heal you or would you go to the medicine cabin would you talk with him if he was standing next to you so that you could know more about him if you had that opportunity what would you do what would you do with it would you want to know what he thinks about you what would you do could you answer the question what thinking of Christ sadly most people would continue acting and living the same way you know why because they would still not recognize that it was him come on the presence of the Lord not recognized we would because we'd say oh it's another brother God bless you that's why after four months after preaching the seals brother Brandon preaches the message Christ is the mystery of God revealed and in this message we find out such a vast understanding a vast revealing of of who God is who Christ is who he is and who Christ is and his bride and it's all laid out brother Shake Yourself come on nowen stay awake come on don't you don't have to look over there to see who I was talking to we we are let's see who that was for for lunch that we say he was napping there uhhuh yeah that's that's that's a about the size of what the way we are listen closely this little scripture brother brandom says what think you of Christ your decision on what that scripture ask that question will fill your eternal if I said nothing else I could walk off the stage right now that simple question it'll seal your Eternal destination I don't know if you're shocked or else you don't care maybe it's making you check yourself that simple question he says it might mean your healing who who's sick who's sick here who have the have the doctors diagnosed come on now they're telling us there are things now that that are here already they have no antibiotics no medicine brother brandham says then you're going to have to believe in Divine Healing it's going to force you to answer the question what think ye of Christ we're walking around like like like zombies sometimes I don't know if I'm going to get better what do you mean answer the question think ye of Christ when you do I tell you your healing depends on the answer to the question your conception of what this question is May determine whether you walk out of your wheelchair or not it might mean the difference between life and death what think you of Christ I looked at this and I'm was shocked I thought I understood a little bit about Christ is the mystery I realized I didn't understand what I thought I understood and I read read it again and then he says my brother my sister what think you of Christ it's an individual question he makes it in general but it's actually individually every one of you has got to answer that question who wants who wants a new birth who wants a new birth answer the question then who wants the Holy Ghost want to be filled answer the question what think he of Christ the anointed one the logos of God what do you think about him woo it's individual now he said let's not reject him in our generation and then he goes on to say let's accept him as the Virgin born son of God build our hopes on nothing less than Jesus blood and righteousness let's stand now and give our testimony tell the world what we think of him are you a Christian means Christlike yeah I'm a Christian in church I [Music] love get around your friends out there you go I go to church once in a while wow what thinking of Christ watch what he says here tell the world what we think about him three things now this is in the message what think you of Christ 1954 who he is what he is and what he is to us then how important is it to answer this question I want you the moment you leave here and the moment you go to bed at night and the moment you get up in the morning I want you to ask yourself what think he of Christ where did I come from Brother what think you of Christ that question answers every question you'll ever have in life if you can answer that question it'll answer every question that ever comes up uh where did I come from what think you of Christ what am I doing here what think you of Christ where am I going what think you of Christ are you getting it you're acting like you're a deer in the Headlights what think you of Christ what a question even his enemies will tell you now what they think of Christ he says this if Judas if we could go down to the regions of the lost to this worrisome place called hell and you could call the deceiving spirits of Judas is scar it to the platform tonight and would say Judas what think you of Christ I could imagine you could hear 30 pieces of silver rattle across the platform and he would say I have betrayed innocent blood what if I could go to the smoldering regions of the Lost no I could go to the smoldering regions of the and called the Roman soldier who took the spear and pushed it into his heart and I would say what think ye of Christ whose son is he he would say truly that is the son of God when Christ was placed before Pontius pilot he had to make a decision of what he thought of him and my brother and sister Christ is placed before you tonight for you to give your opinion and make your decision what you think of him and your action will speak much louder than your words right I'm a Christian let me see your actions by your fruits you're known the first thing God wanted to reveal himself to the people he couldn't do it as Jehovah God so then comes forth from him something visible a light oh now now it's coming and we'll get into a lot of those things in our next one but I I I I just want to come to this now that and this is in the message Christ is the mystery goes on to say he wanted to be a loving father for he was a father and the only way he could do it was express it was to become a son a man that's why Jesus kept saying son of man see they didn't know what he was talking about many of them he said but now you get it they didn't know it back then but now you get it he wanted to express himself that was his one of his great three full purposes and so as we continue on he says now the logos that went out of God which was the logos all this began to form into a body shape and this body shape was called in the scholars teachings the logos Loos the logos that went out of God in other words a better word for it was what we call a theophany sir theophany is a human body that's glorified then he says well not exactly with flesh and blood like it will be in a glorified state but it is of a form of a human body that doesn't eat neither does it drink but it's a body that's waiting for us as soon as we leave this one now now we're barely beginning to see who Christ is not a third person of the Trinity but a furtherance of the of the unfolding of this great mystery of who God is finally man could have at least some idea of who he is so we know the scripture John 1: was the word the logos the word logos was with God and the Word was God and the Word was God and the word logos was made flesh and dwelt amongst us and we beheld his glory the glory as of the only begotten of the father full of grace and truth the Bible says he was the image of the invisible God Church don't let me lose you right now you can feel the spirit start to drift away your Eternal destination come on now we don't learn huh we don't learn we like never mind comes to Earth come a man name was Jesus that was his Tabernacle the Tabernacle of the invisible God and Christ means the anointed one now how many of you know Christ what do you think of him good thoughts or bad thoughts how often do you think about him I know sometimes service is so long brother Bram says you're just not in love when I was going out with my wife and I was in Colorado she was over here it didn't even matter if we said anything I just like to hear oh just just her breath on the phone I was in love oh next time you complain about church you need to ask yourself the question am I in love with him or not where else are you going to go Christ is the principal theme of the entire Bible we got to know this if you read the Bible and don't see Christ in every scripture go back and read it again because you missed something come on now this is this is it's what I said earlier of Israel it's making them think have we missed something if you read the Bible and you and you and you don't see him in every scripture you miss something the Bible is Christ he is the word he was in the prophets he was in the Psalms he was in the history of the Bible the Bible is a prophetic book it's a historical book it's a book of love it's a book of songs it's a book of life and in there you find Christ come on now you haven't found him that he's telling you where to find him but you'll find the mechanics but once it comes inside of you you got to become the Temple of the Dynamics Dynamics is what makes the mechanics do what it's supposed to do he's the same yesterday today and forever he should be the Principal theme of our talking what think you of Christ he should be the Principal theme of our talking he should be the Principal theme of our thinking of our singing of our walks he should be the Principal theme of our life what think he of Christ once again our talking our thinking our singing it shows what we really think of Christ oh we're going to get into something good here the problem is and listen closely we may have an understanding of who Christ is but where we fail is that we lack the furtherance of the revelation of Christ how many of you ever heard M how many of you ever heard the message that our founding pastor preached what of Adam's Rib what of Adam's Rib what about that rib of Adam oh come on now I'm talking about the furtherance of the of the revelation of Christ we know Jesus Christ of 2,000 years ago now let me throw a curve at you is it just Christ is just that body that man 2,000 years ago brother brandom says Revelations 101 another Mighty Angel come down from heaven brother brandham says that's Christ okay now where are you at what are you thinking of Christ now huh that's right uh oh what think you of Christ I'm telling you we got to answer this question or we ain't going nowhere your action speaks louder than your words he should be the principle of everything in our life and when you answer the finally answer the question what think he of Christ then you can make the same declaration that Andrew made John 140 and 41 and one of the two which heard John speak and followed him was Andrew Simon Peter's brother he first findeth his own brother Simon and sayth unto him we have found the Messiah we have found the Messiah which is being interpreted the Christ now what think ye of Christ we have found him and his whole purpose was not to stand next to you to see what you're doing that was not the purpose it was to reveal himself in Christ and to have preeminence in his bride he's not going to just ride along in the seat next to you in your car he's not just going to sit next to you in church he wants to dwell inside of you so that you can answer the the question what think you of Christ for when Christ is in his throne we don't have to check and see what we're looking at no that stuff doesn't I don't care about that stuff I have nothing inside of me that's that's crying or or Desiring pornography is to please the groom what of me is to know him and to know what he thinks about me now I'm on the right track and when I get to church what think you of Christ first thing we do is raise our hands we clap our hands we sing the Psalms we read the scriptures why because he's the principal theme of everything in our Liv oh we have found found him Peter Peter was not the first one to say he was the Christ no Andrew beat him to it Andrew is the one that actually told him we have found the Messiah which being interpreted as Christ my question is how many of you can say we have found the Messiah no you all haven't found him well first of all you got to be looking for him every one of you that's why everybody's and and they have a boyfriend and I don't and he's got a girlfriend first the kingdom of God and all these other things will be added to you quit trying to add everything to yourself come on I'm going to say it again quit trying to add everything to yourself there's a triple purpose why God is doing what he's doing do you not think that he already has somebody for you why are we making wrong de bad decisions because we get try to get ahead of the plan we have found the Messiah we have found the Christ Colossians 1 127 says to whom God would make known what is the riches of the glory of this mystery among the Gentiles which is Christ in you the hope of glory we have found the Messiah many of you have found the Messiah years ago you found him maybe years ago there are people here that have found the Messiah years ago and that's what we do is to preach tell you we have found him if they tell you he's in the desert don't believe him if they tell you he's in the secret chamber somewhere don't believe him we found him W I'm I can't finish but I'm I'm going to start winding down a little bit okay we have found him you know where I found him he's living in his body of Believers today that then outside of that you you'll never find him Oh either you believe me or you don't outside of that you're never going to find him he's not out there Christ in you is the hope of glory got the question you think of Christ he's awesome ask me what I think of Christ he Liv in my heart oh we talk every day oh Lord I go I go out running in the morning to the love of my life good morning my love I'm not talking to him way out there right here ah Lord we we've got these issues we need your help Lord so I'm asking you to come on the scene today we have our conversations I'm sure many of you do too but don't look any further that's why to many people they say they'll repeat brother Brandon and say oh the sickest body is the body of the Lord Jesus and and that's all we know sick body and I look at that and I'm like it's still the sickest body wow on it he said that 50 60 years later and the sickest body what do you mean by that is not there healing in that body I I I don't get it it's the members it's the people we're the sick ones because we cannot recognize or or discern the Lord's body but when when I looked at again and I and I read it again and it said the sickest body and I looked at that and it hit me I we were in Norway when it hit me he says is it still sick son and I looked at that and he says what does the word sick there mean and I looked it up and you know what it sick means it means that when you're love sick it means that there's a longing it's the sickest body in the sense that it's a there's a longing in us for all the members to come together now then it don't have to be sick now they can rise up as an army of but we're still with the same thing we're sick and we're sick and we're sick come on now you should be Desiring to have Fellowship come on why aren't we Desiring that because we don't ever get around each other we should be Lovick to get around each other I got my own people I don't have to go there because you know that you're wrong not that you have people that you like to finger out what I'm saying that is we don't ever make an effort we can always talk about the brother and the sister but when do we ever go in and visit those people that we talk about when do we ever do that is there not a longing oh no they can go you knowwhere you've never answered the question I'm going to say it again you've never answered the question come around the corner just we we'll have to stop somewhere because this this this this series is loaded we found the we found the Messiah he says here in the message of the Messiah his standing light is the light of Messiah risen Christ in his people the fance of the Revelation the anointed ones carrying forth his light into all the church AG sometime it almost completely goes out out and then he comes back again God's anointed one God's me Messiah Church Messiah means the anointed one it means king and then if the church is Anointed by the Messiah Spirit it becomes a lesser but still a messiah we know we know our founding Pastor he' say I don't believe in little christs right little CH do you ever know of a little part of Christ never seen a little part of Christ but I don't believe it's little in that sense I believe it's little in the sense that that each one is given a portion but when you get it all together ain't nothing little about she is him now let me get this now then if the church is Anointed by the Messiah Spirit it becomes a lesser but still a messiah because it has his light reflecting his power reflecting his glory reflecting his Dominion now we are the light if we are we reflect his Messiah light the Messiah sign follows the Messi the same as it followed the Messiah once again the Messiah sign follows the Messi the same as it followed the Messiah that's the way God's churches his Eagles or his eaglets his Messiah they look like him they act like him they preach like him they do the works that he did these are the Messi we have found the Messiah where'd you find him not way out there I found him I'm going to stop with this and it's a story that I that I came across and I pray that it uh pray that it blesses you I have your undivided attention just for five minutes I'll stop for now the story is this says that there was a monastery deep in the forest that these monks were so full of joy The Joy was contagious the people traveled from far and wide to to receive some of that Joy one day young man asked the Abbott which the Abbott is the head of the monastery why do people come he replied they come looking for an answer looking for answers to their questions such as what should I do with my life coming on pilgrimage pilgrimages how do I get the most out of life and as time passed things began to change there the older monks began to be a little cranky began to close their hearts off to God and each other hear close their hearts off to God and each other the very joy that attracted the VIS visitors was no longer there this is a process that goes through so many churches As Time passed fewer and fewer visitors came to visit no one came at all and one morning the head the Abbot was praying asking God to restore the place wonder what had gone wrong what had gone wrong with her with place that once was filled with joy when he felt impressed to go on a journey himself he went deeper into the woods to go see a friend of his that was the supposed to be the wisest man in the land when arrived he he simply said I need to ask you a question the hermit said not now follow me says that he took him to a lake and they stood there meditating for hours the lake was so still it was perfectly reflecting the Sun and after some time the hermit tells the Abbot he said you see the son is we can say is God the sun is God and the lake is you he said and as long as everything is still and there's peace we reflect God perfectly he said but throughout the day the winds begin to blow he said and all of a sudden with all the ripples he says it doesn't reflect the sun like it used to he said so it is with us in our soul and all is well and there is peace we reflect God but when troubles and Trials Come is where we have the problem and as he returned back he said let's go back to my my place ask me your questions the ab began what wisdom do you have for us his first question and how do we rejuvenate the monastery and how can we best serve the people who come to visit the hermit said I will answer your three questions with one answer go back and tell the Brethren this as the Abbot returned back to the monastery he gathered all the monks together and he says I have heard from the from the her the The Hermit and I have something to tell you I've asked the three questions he gave me an answer that answered all of them could possibly be they all said what answer could give be the answer for all the questions simply said this he told me to come back and tell you brothers that Messiah is among you think about this just tell them that Messiah is among them for one moment they looked at each other differently they thought of each other differently they began to treat each other differently the Brethren wondered day and night who is this Messiah that that is amongst us was it brother Adrian Bartholomew they wondered but as they wondered they began to treat each other with a renewed kindness and now a profound respect things began to change there was a new spirit of cooperation they encouraged one another compassion and forgiveness returned to their hearts and they were kind to one another and they spoke well of one another knew life was breathed to the community and before they knew it the visitors began to return one afternoon as the Abbot was sitting on a bench a woman approached him and says what happened here this place has been completely transformed he said it wasn't or isn't the place that was transformed it isn't the place it was the brothers that were transformed how did it happen we started Living as if the Messiah was amongst us she began to tell her tell him her problems struggles and she asked him what advice can you give me he looked at her and gave her these words of wisdom from now on treat every person that you ever meet like the second coming of Jesus in Disguise I said wow if we have not already recognized Messiah is amongst us look around and you might say who is it it's the same yesterday today and forever he's just now in his body now if he would treat each other like that ah well that brother don't worry about the brother you worry about yourself you worry about your home let them worry about theirs treat each other as if the Messiah is amongst I'm tell you he is amongst us neighbor give him your hand say neighbor will brother will would you come say the Messiah is amongst us say neighbor we have found the Messiah we have found the Christ and he's living and doing well in the hearts of the believer what a thing we it is church when we can finally answer the question what thinky of Christ we want to get into some wonderful things that in this series but I pray that that I pray that this Foundation would put a it's a good foundation for us to build on stand to your feet once again once again we started Living like the Messiah was amongst us how many would like to live that way I don't know about you but I've got both my hands I want to live like that because I know he's here now every time we come it should be a joy coming to the house of the Lord nobody should have to tell raise your hands ra no you
