home with the tracheotomy so the machines could breathe for her at home you know as a mother watching your child just lay there with no way to help them it's the most helpless feeling i have ever felt and for me it brought me to the lowest i had ever felt my whole life there was not one thing i could do on my own all i could do was trust in the lord i had to put into action all that i claimed i prayed to the lord and asked for a miracle during this prayer i promised the lord that i would do something and that was a special he then showed me serenity in our pastor's hands being dedicated to the lord and i knew everything would be fine even though it has been 11 years i have not forgotten that promise god bless you [Music] i've had questions there's been times my trials come to me to

the will of god's offer not in vain [Music] bless you tonight privilege to be here tonight i want to thank everyone for the effort that they made to come happy to be in the house of the lord hey man so not to uh have you standing too much longer and let's turn everybody get situated here i want to thank our our pastor for the confidence that he has in us allowing us to speak here on this sacred desk we're going to read a very familiar scripture for the law having a shadow of good things to come and not the very image of the things can never with those sacrifices which they offered year by year continually make the comer there onto perfect sombra de los vienes venideros de las cosas uh let's go to verse 2 for then would they not have ceased to be offered because the worshiper once purged should not have had no conscience of sins versus you may be seated so just uh should you just bear with me tonight i i don't know where to where how to enter into this thing but uh luckily it's not us and it's uh it's the holy spirit and what he wants no spiritual and we're sure that that it'll be him speaking this evening we've done everything that we need to on our part we study we meditate almost ask the lord for guidance so now we're just waiting on him on what he what he wants to do but so so we're we're talking here in hebrews and and it says it says a word there that kind of stood out to me and and actually if i could put a title to this thought it's a it's your conscience and the day of judgment should have no more conscience of sins immediately and and the definition reads definition there is the sense or consciousness of the of moral goodness or blame worthiness character the character together with the feeling of obligation tensions and characters another definition of consciousness portrays the rightness or wrongness the acer vienne of one's behavior it took me to the word intentions anonymous what one intends to do okay whether good or bad whether ccs so just to put a little bit of basis on that's what we're gonna what we're gonna speak on tonight and this goes off of an experience that i had so just remember there's going to be some things in here that hit me first okay so so we're so we speak unconscious and you look at the society today specifically with uh with the election especially election so it looks like we're in the election months now it's messes there it's months and and it looks like like they you know they keep finding you know things that are that are wrong and you know things that are false as but you look at all the politicians politicos and and you hear them speak hablar and you have to wonder if they have a conscience because a lot of them they will just say a bold face lie and and they they speak to the people and like like if like if nothing it's nothing you know it's you so you ask do they have a conscience or not you know but there's a lot of times where the conscience has been seared and we never want to get to that point i mean they'll swear up and down um and they they speak evil of people for just anything and it seems like if you don't agree with their views you know it seems like there's they get like they they get like a hatred towards you you look at them speak about one another and there's a genuine hater you know you you hear you hear things in the media escuchas uh and it's a one-sided affair yes the have been censored for their views you can say something about a certain political party and i won't mention it behind them but you you put something down and they'll censor it and the other side they covered up a lot of things so this is and this is the thing that got me yesterday because it even comes down to the message of the hour malachi 4-5 i'm not speaking on the denomination william marion branham william marion branham and it seems like that thing has crept in there if you believe a certain way they put you in a certain group right away they put you in a certain category and even that means god came up with he thought of something else and that disqualifies him from being qualified because god knows the beginning from the end from the very beginning the principle so if they can put the first quote up for me father the hour has come it's a little long but i need to read it to give a little bit of foundation because there's some there's some things like i said i know because it hit me like i said they they sting a little bit but we're talking about the conscience so let us let us uh read the first quote if they have it i don't know if i give them enough time okay so it's a little bit lengthy but just bear with me okay okay so it says see micah was right on on the on that word that word had to be fulfilled yes there's nothing around there no blood no sangria see i can just walk any time i want to yes brother branham says i can take possession of that thing that whole denomination i can get the whole thing they don't even believe in the blood i so i can i can take the whole thing god said that's right you can do that i'll go down there and get in them fellows i'll blind their eyes from that from the word that's all i have to do and and can't see it yes ears and they can't hear it oh sorry i think i skipped here keep them from the worst so they can't see it you know god does that a lot of a lot of times then you'll get him up there in total and so one of these preachers did his and his great prestige become so isu what what would i say it becomes so degraded before the people that he walked up and smacked him in the face i hope we don't do that even spiritually speaking he said why which way went the spirit of god out of me as it was in the other days it's a lying spirit that's in false prophets they're telling you a lie if the spirit gets spiritual just says this all liberation of women and do all these other things and go out act like the world is so so i asked you know after reading this quote i asked myself so a lying spirit a spiritu mentiroso is not something that's not lined up with the word so that means one thing we better stay lined up with the words [Music] so that means is for for my job i i had to take a polygraph for what's called the light detector for me i wonder if there's a lot of times many times we hear something that comes behind the police our names come to our mind or maybe a lot of time many times we think oh it's the people out there it's the drunkard oh he's talking about the drunken the drug addict the the thief the murderer but what about those that say one thing and have different intentions in their heart what about those who secretly have odd against somebody else we have to love everybody yes because we can work around it and we could say yes i have love and you're saying the truth but not all and it's a lot more work than telling the truth so it causes certain reactions in our body gauze reactions it causes us to be like a neurotic people always trying to cover something up i don't your conscience and the day of judgment but judgment begins in the house of the lord that's the beauty of it because there'll come a time where there'll be that great white throne judgment work on getting these things out of us work on clearing our conscience because nobody has to judge you nobody has to judge me oh conscience come it's right now this is the whole story this is not a narrative drama by the politicians but this is the word the merciful man do with doeth good to his own soul but he that is cruel trouble with his own flesh i'll let you know where i'm going with this and like i said i'm not throwing at anybody but when i read the quote immediately i said well i'm not one that says that the signs don't follow and i don't say that he is not the same you know but i have to ask myself other questions i am not one who says signs and wonders don't follow i don't want to fail to discern the body but do i pick and choose in whom and where he is the same pero es coco es escojo es el mismo god forbid i ever dislocate the body oh there's no permit um what does brother branham say this hermano brenda a man without a new birth he's a beast okay isn't that what he says what does a beast do yeah a beast by nature his instincts to instinct he is to protect himself and his own so what does that show the mind of christ doesn't show that the mind of christ says the family of god a beast mentality or with me tonight do i sing a little louder and go a little crazier only when certain song leaders get up do i say amen a little louder and more often is without exemption he is the very best that we have yes and everybody should scream to the top of their lungs because i will say that is the angel to the church do i fall all over myself oh make me go i see mismo when i say hi to certain brothers hermanos but when someone you don't care for comes up do i want mercy for those people who i love and are in favor of misery those that or because frankly you just want to keep them down frankly speaking um are we just cruel estamos cruellas and this this hits me first inventory starts at home inventory and i have to ask myself have i been guilty of this is does my conscience bother me is there something inside of me there's telling me hey you need to fix this these things are wrong you ain't going nowhere nova so without fixing these things so i say this because of the experience i had an experience so so by god's grace for la gracia i'm in the process of getting a security clearance for my job it requires it and and the clearance is top secret so so in the process here in a process and i don't even know how long i've been going but i only said bro jerry in the process in the processor so they run through your life it was examined with a fine tooth comb the cercas so they're looking if you've ever been arrested do you have bankruptcy do you have a domestic violence and then on top of that you have to you have to meet with a private investigator and they talk first of all you have to fill out a giant packet of all the everywhere you've lived where your relatives are familiar what your blood type is just about get to casey quest and then you meet with the investigator they verify the information um they take your fingerprints thomann to do you know of any disputes that he's had um have the police ever been to his house what kind of person do you see him they contact some of the contacts i put in the package they're basically trying to get my background yes and our pastor was one of them so he knows what kind of person is he okay class is he is he straightforward yes so they want to know everything about you and after a while he despised on i had to go to denver by denver and go through what's called the polygraph of the light detectors and i don't know if anyone has ever had to go through one of those you know even though say you don't have anything negative against by nature those tests foreign so did you know that god had a light detector test in the old testament in the new testament ocho oh levi he said let your thumb and your urine belong to your godly man whom you proved at messiah and looked up that word it means testing with whom you contend it at the waters of meribah which means afflictions or so so so god had a lie detector test in the old testament you have to turn to it i'll just read it here because i'm sure they'll put it up you shall put in the breast breast piece of judgment the urem and the thumb and they shall be over aaron's heart when he goes in before the lord and aaron shall carry the judgment of the sons of israel over his heart before the lord continually ponders the old testament testament they had three ways of knowing a message the first way they find out it was either written on the law era escrito escrito the next thing was a prophet the next thing was the urum thomas now any teacher knows what the urem thumb was it was a light that flashed over the breastplate of aaron that they had hanging hanging in the temple now if a prophet prophesied and then if they see us if a dreamer dreamed the dreams and it didn't flash on the urim thomas it was wrong has been done away with in that sense but this is god's german thumbnail there was a a lie detector test in the old testament notice how brother branham uses euroman thomas he doesn't say and they say he always puts them together he always says so i want to define the message of the hour yes it's perfect because it's complete it's perfect so what is a show perfection brings the light of the gospel perfection the light of the world and won't go into his territory you know i entered into territory i just want to mention a little bit about it so there's a perfect there's an alignment jupiter and saturn saturn which will bring what if we can align ourselves where he was going if no one ever goes into judgment without thoroughly being warned let you get up there in time in the morning to go to get to church but notice exactly there's something going to follow this revival is now remember your conscience in the day of judgment as i was saying let us receive our judgment now i'm not going to judge you you're not your conscience [Music] so after all this i came up to the polygraph test and and watch this during the lie detector test number one this man is trained to watch deception um he's watching all this while you're sitting on a chair with a camera on it so there's there's a there's a chair you're you're sitting down with a camera on it is i wouldn't there are sensors on your hand that detect perspiration there's a blood pressure monitor to check your heart rate and your in your blood pressure there is a cable that picks up the movement across your chest the system is calibrated to your emotional state at the time the system has it's going to look bad on you because that means you're showing that you're trying to decieve so he he does they make and then they make you intentionally lie so he wants to see he wants to see your state when you're normal and when you lie and then he sits on the corner very nonchalant very uh very casual he very calm we calm unless it's something illegal yes he says i don't care what the answers are i just want to know if you're truthful he says the united states government they entrust a lot of top-secret information to people that are cleared so we have to be sure do you have any concern about those questions do you have anything that you would like to say at this time i'm going to give you the opportunities because once we're live in the forest and i want you to explain any concerns you have within you can the only thing i could so there we are so there i am i'm nervous he says it's okay now i'm going to ask you questions and maybe there'll be a pause between five and ten seconds and then if i ask you the question two or three times don't get nervous it's okay okay so then we go through the test the test run la prevalence [Music] it'll have an effect on your job you won't be able to receive your clearance so you don't have to take it it's okay so actually before we start you are you sure you want to proceed so the test begins ask me the question he tells me oh you did uh uh you breathed really hard right there huh oh he says don't move your foot because i can see the the movement on your foot don't move your foot then you ask questions someone [Music] but you got to remember the blood pressure monitor so he goes through that little period of time 5-10 seconds to see if you thought of anything to see if you and he says okay i'm going to ask you this question here oh let's wait i want to just do it again so like i said at that point this oh my goodness you're in full blown inventory mode right you're thinking of stuff is so in my mind i'm thinking like i said it doesn't even compare to the great wine blanco and he tells you right off the bat he says i'm looking for deception and then he asked me mr gonzalez i have to be truthful there are some that don't care for me like i said it's during that time you're under the magnifying glass yes you can lie no placement you can try i got that so so i the only thing i could do is bring this to a spiritual sense there are senses on your feet i i i uh around are sensors that monitor your heart sensors now remember we can trick all the rest oh brother because we can say oh my feet only take me to church my brother with my hands i do a lot of work and by the heart cannot be faked will always give you away because the human body was not made so during those questions you always i want you to catch this okay i want to get this in because my time is going during the questions when you ask the question and you waited five to ten seconds because he's looking for the initial response and he wants to see if the confession matches brother in the in the life i didn't give him these i didn't have enough time i apologize watch this year then the devil has another way el diablo remember he wants to see movement when during those five or ten seconds he wants to see this movement then the devil has another way we just have a movement i'll do i live a good life but the devil has perverted that pero el diablo he lets you think to satisfy your guilty certificate you can't get satisfaction by joining a church you don't put our statistically but don't settle for nothing less but no no no haciendas young people i want you to hear this because i'll tell you one thing there's no shortcuts there's no way of of purring this up watch us but don't settle for nothing less than an old-fashioned experience of the new birth [Music] when your soul and god unites together oh conjunction and you become one is so young people are lost you know that there's no shortcut for them no no no no the great thing is that we still have time right now we still have time we have very little time but there's still time and as long as we have time [Music] means the rise or fall of leaders is it a shift of some sort is coming yes so let it be for the good but nope we have an opportunity remember warning and then judgment what do you think the angel of the church has been trying to do with us all this time you know bringing us to where we need to be he leads me to green pastures so that's what he's trying to do so and i remember a dream that i believe it was so our confession of our mouth confession must match the confession of our hearts we're going to make it yes through the new birth yes just live thank you hey man let's stand to your feet hey man can you get one you got servant and also to the lord jesus christ for beautiful message amen can you just raise your hands right there blessed assurance jesus is mine don't
