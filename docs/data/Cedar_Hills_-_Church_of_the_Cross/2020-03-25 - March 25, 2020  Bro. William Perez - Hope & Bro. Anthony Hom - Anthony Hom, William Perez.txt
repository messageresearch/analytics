obedience caviar with in Seattle and therefore they were entitled to the top individual in that household individually so car became responsible because their response so with that I want to just this is just gonna be a little addendum solo us at home book it Mindy maybe just a little something that goes in the back part of what her brother Diego and with the panel spoke today but I'll go I coulda got all okay I'll okay it was so perfect that I didn't want to bring in another another piece on that commend okay interfere in his own mental but but uh but the Lord gave me this remember us though and let it be just a little little something on the back algo que puede poner la la parte de trois we got into something when we were in our rehearsal the other night in local yeah kasam was incidental para esto and it was a little controversial it all go controversy yeah so I said mm-hmm yo but but the the question was pregunta Eric can a believer get the coronavirus whether you enter a severe LV Rose de Corona now we heard brother Diego there towards the end John was a mother Yagoda also phenom we said now if somebody were to happen to get it yes yet again a rather severe don't make a scandal about vagon escandalo and and I believe a brother Diego said look even model Diego I believe that what he said is it can't touch the bride okay lo que no puedo tocar allah-allah no via it can't touch the believer no puedo tocar el creme de but but yet pero there is so many things that are touching us right now I bent the scores consistent in Sandow virus has caused so many things mr. Vito certain Tascosa maybe if you didn't get the corona virus yes you still a little Corona you're at home just like us on the the government's telling you not you're not essential example since you're telling you that you're not worth nothing you said no violate them stay home yes and I don't spread it no no Vegas and it touches us in a way that in our minds inserted mistrust min now maybe we feel like we're not useful yet no stevo's candle but let me tell you right of Christ tonight but then as you don't know via the crystal you are essential who states since yeah you are the very essence of Misbah since you're the very essence of who he is amiss Messiah can you the world needs you yell mootness the world don't realize how much that it needs you don't suck with or without then who's there is no blood on this there is no sacrifice being merry fishes and you are essential to this essence yeah least I don't you it's it's it's gone and it's touched so many of us in our economics muchos la la parte economica it's touched us in our pantries in with restless anus it's even touched us in our restaurants owned in westeros vanos but it touched us in so many ways in Dantas Meniere's but but but I believe what our brother Diego has brought us is truthful okay normal voice Vera and they can't touch the bride no puedo got a la novia Anna but I also know something else that he said I mean algo mas que dijo it's it's something that works on the surfaces yeah algo que trabaja and let's to perficio it works on the surface okay but Rama had a supervision and God's Word don't need any private interpretation either palabras he think the purpose there's no interpretations needed here no interpretation this is audio because gods were don't need any interpretation couple already was no necessity he interprets it when he makes it come to pass a super super Paula Paula canto VN acontecimiento but but I like what brother Abraham said during our rehearsal looking home on over on inside you said we have to prove things by the word at mo skip robot todo por la palabra when brother Abraham says something for the women around boy I sure take it to heart surely that no
