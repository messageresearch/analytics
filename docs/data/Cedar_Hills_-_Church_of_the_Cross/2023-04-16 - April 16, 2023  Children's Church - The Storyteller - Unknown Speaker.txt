enjoy joy joy joy [Music] to stay [Music] [Applause] [Music] I got the love is in my heart [Music] so very [Music] soon how's everybody doing this evening nice now I would like to thank the pastor for giving me the opportunity for letting me preacher and just to share with you guys this thought that I had on Wednesdays now what my thought is about Redemption and what it is so now I would like to ask you guys a question yeah what is redemption is redemption anybody again you may be seated too well guess I'm here to help well Redemption if you search it up it means to regain a possession or an object o through a price for impression now aura if we split the word redemption in half we get redeemed foreign now I would like you guys to imagine that day on Calvary when I save your diet now I would like you guys to just paint that picture of him getting nailed on the cross when he was bruised when he was whipped it was love who drove him to do that is and when he did that he knew that he was paying the price for all of our redemptions now now that we know that it took Jesus's death to purchase our Redemption now brother banham also does say that if there's no death there is no Redemption so now if we sink in a little bit deeper profundo this also means that we need to die in order to get our redempt to claim our redemptions now I want you guys to think about that you guys are redeemed I want you guys to notice how lucky you are to be redeemed because Angels don't know what it's like to be redeemed hasta Los Angeles now I would like to tell you guys about this little story now about um the violin in the Poncho the violina now one day there was this violin in a poncho is now no one wanted to buy it it was worthless in this case it didn't have God it is now until one day a violin master came into the shop um now when the violin Master played this violini now he played this beautifully and people wanted to buy it and I believe that that violin master was God because he gave us value because without him we are nothing now I would like to talk to the youth a little here now what colors or what is the color of redemption red okay so correct now now I have another question we know red and red is in God's eyes is white we already know that Redemption is one red yes what is the other end the youth anybody the sin now it's not the blood of the sin the sinner's blood is it it doesn't have any power now what I found very interesting location is that salvation is also red too that's another red is and we know that the sin is red so I'll be finishing with this now how many here believe that they have been redeemed by God how many feel like if it wasn't a coincidence that you guys have been redeemed would like to thank God yeah thank you praise the Lord amen you guys hear me I talk really loud so this mic it almost sounds like me so just to be sure nod your head if you can hear me right now okay good all of these ones knotted those ones did not well it's okay I will speak louder God bless you all it is so good to see you it is you all look amazing as always and you guys are awesome yeah I like that one was that the middle I like that you guys are tremendous yeah listen I tried okay I really did I did you know you guys are so awesome this is that God gave you your own service think about that isn't that awesome yeah that's good so it's an honor to be here thank you for having me and I am a Storyteller what he said but okay we have another Storyteller his brother Boaz here Boaz Boaz has a story for us would you mind coming up Boaz telling us your story about all right so why not I went into my dad's office one day and I said dad you're probably gonna get a note home sent from school and he's like why what happened so I was standing in line to get my food from the cafeteria and I looked to my left and I see a big bowl of apples well Manzana and there was a no that said only take one God is watching so I go further down the line and I see a big bowl of cookies so I decided and it said it is here take all you want God's watching the apples huh that was awesome brother Bo thank you we have the talento we have got the talent yeah [Laughter] oh man I love that thank you brother well let's get started we got 20 minutes starting now I learned that from you guys I'm just kidding I was like oh I got quiet in it you are the light of the world that's the that's the message title I have and if there was a subtitle it would be how to deal with bullies everybody has a bully yeah yeah that's good or they might be just generally out in the world right it might be a church yeah I hope not it's better okay no but they might be and they might even be at home what are you talking about well it's okay don't panic don't freak out yet that comes later right now we relax with the story there's a lot of bullies out there right I even experienced the bully a couple of weeks ago and I hadn't even left my house for two minutes it had been exactly 45 seconds and I backed out of my driveway and I went down to the stop sign at the end of my street well uh a La Parada yes and this car came zooming by yes but before they hit me and Liz they slammed on their brakes and they got mad at me I was stopped what did I do Yahoo I don't know but they were mad at me for it I know what they were saying I'm glad I don't but she did not look happy she was very wordy with what she was saying all right he's very wordy so we all face a bully at some point even sometimes it's ourselves I think that's the most common boy but the important thing is to identify who the real bully is the biggest goalie of them all who can tell me it's a hard pick okay I'm gonna pick whoever raised their hands right now later for something else we'll go with you buddy because you were first it says Satan I agree he's a big bully right he likes to tell us things and that's why when we our biggest enemies not really but he likes to put thoughts in her head you can't do that you can't do this lady right that's how it sounds it's just ugh right sometimes it comes to people that we thought were friends family and so on Familia Etc but here's the important thing devil can't do anything to you unless God says so if you think about it like that takes us to our second story where this is a common story that happens all the time the devil walks up to God and he says hey can I pick on that one and God says yeah see go for it let's see what you got because I know that guy he is awesome so you can try to bully them all you want you can hate them all you want but he's gonna hit you right back with love boy boy you guys might not know that reference but it was good this one this morning right so that's important I want to read you guys these scriptures Matthew 5 10-16 and I went through and I simplified it for you okay so I took the big words made them small so you can read it with me but it's going to sound a little different for me okay so we're going to start with 5 10. blessed are those who suffer to be justified for their justification is the Kingdom of Heaven blessed are you who are defamed or taunted and have people be mean to you and say evil things Jesus be cheerful and jump for joy yeah you have a big reward for you in heaven is for they were mean to the prophets before you Isn't that cool did you know that when when people are mean to you that means that they are doing what they did to the prophets years ago so you're right there with them imagine those prophets and you're standing right there getting the same treatment but that's okay because we're together I think it's cool I thought that was cool you are the salt of the earth kind of a strange saying is but it's basically you guys are the flavor [Music] you know that you know salt when you put it on meat it brings out the flavor that's you guys you guys make the world great El Mundo if you were to lose your saltiness then how would the Earth be salted imagine for a second a world without you in it I'm gonna be honest I don't like it no I don't like it I like you here I really like you here you all are great you are welcome than uh if one of you isn't here I don't like it one of them isn't here I don't like it and even if you do have to go this is the Dennis gate there's going to be more salt to take your place because we all through all times are the salt of the earth so it's a good thing salt that isn't salty is worthless under the foot of men ye are the light of the world you live in a dark time right you ever walked outside when the moon isn't out in the middle of the forest it's scary our pastor knows he's a hunter he knows all you see is nothing but sometimes you got a little Candlelight yeah or flashlight interna we have a light right and it's important to have that it's important but it can be scary in these dark times right but that's okay because the city on a hill can't hide it's very obvious men don't light a candle and hide it [Music] is they put it on a Candlestick and it gives light to everyone in the house let your light shine like that before men so they can see good works and glorify your father God okay gotten through the scriptures you can wake back up again no not that one okay we'll move on to the next joke it's it's really important because it's if you understand what the light is it's Jesus right it's Jesus Jesus is the light as who says you are a little Jesus and when God allows the bully to come your way trying to do one of two things either a justify you ah justification show them that your God is alive both are really good that light or that City on a Hill Monte we have our next story is very short but my whole life I noticed when I'd walk around people would stare you may have noticed this happened to you too if you have you're not alone because it's very weird but it happens right and it's very obvious yes because if you see a light on a hill on a hill in the middle of the night people are going to go wow that is the city and it is on a hill in the middle of the night that I can make very clear that's the exact reaction I used to hear is yeah walking through the store someone goes foreign [Music] and that's okay let's dive in that's good that's when I would say it's even healthy we might be bullied the most you might wonder why but just remember that it's because God said go right ahead they know exactly how to beat in case you don't know though I'm going to tell you how it's very very simple are you ready okay one last time if I hit the brakes and you guys fly out this is on you okay so buckle up let's go all right there we go we're buckled in okay now we hit the gas all right so how do we do it let's go to Matthew 5 44. I'll just read it but I say unto you love your enemies bless them that curse you and this is do good to them that hate you I said and pray for them which despitefully is so that's how you let your light shine If someone becomes your enemy yeah and they say I don't like you because of reasons and you say that's okay I love you because my God said too and that's enough for me yes you'd be surprised how well that works it's so rare these days that one act of kindness is enough to make people stop in their tracks I've seen it happen someone was mad at me and I looked at them and I went and they were and it was like their whole life got changed for a second they said what happened yes the programmed reaction is and this one goes and then they both just scream loud enough until nobody can hear each other don't do that smile Adam give him a hug or don't if they're being really scared and love them to close I'll tell you a story about a light that I keep on from now on about a light I keep on kind of a scary story scarier because it's true but uh about two weeks ago I was at home I was asleep it's about two in the morning and my doorbell goes [Music] in me he's awesome he is good at his job so the doorbell goes and I went as stiff as a board yes even yes so yeah I I thought it was a ghost it's okay but in reality I was paler than whatever ghost it would have been fantasma I was scared I saw cam the man of the house gotta get it together okay whatever's happening right now okay I am here to handle it is I pull out my baton I have a baton by my bed it's like give me like a police patrol it's like yeah and I'm like yes please text your mom and see if it's hurt right I opened the door pitch black my whole house is dark there is not a light on inside or out and suddenly a calm comes over me and I go you know it's okay the eagle I don't know why but I think it's okay I'm glad here we go if there's anybody in here I tell you what we'll learn today right walk out stand in my kitchen ready what's funny is this isn't how you hold the Baton but this is don't know what I'm doing but I walk out and it's nothing million thoughts are running through my head but I relax turn on the lights okay then I go check out the doors so I think that's really strange because if there was someone in here I don't think they would have rang the doorbell but also I would have found them by now so I go to the front door and this is the scary part is about as silent as this and I look back and I look at the clock and it's wide open the door wasn't locked yeah the front door to my castle was completely compromised and I locked it immediately and I said Thank You Lord because nothing bad was there it was dark and it was scary but I turned the lights on and the door that I had was compromised but it was brought to my attention that that was the case and I fixed it so I've determined that the Holy Spirit came and rang my doorbell mostly because after I thought about it if it was a criminal it wouldn't have given me a friendly they wouldn't have given me a friendly hello [Music] so I keep the light on in the front of my house from now on so thank God because I trust in the Lord but I also want my lights on in case someone wants to try to test me and that's physical and spiritual yes thank you all so much you've been fantasticos and God blessed [Applause] thank you hey man you can stand give him a round of applause that was amazing [Applause] thank you brother Reuben thank you brother Julian let's sing that song I'll Fly Away [Music] okay but you already know how to
