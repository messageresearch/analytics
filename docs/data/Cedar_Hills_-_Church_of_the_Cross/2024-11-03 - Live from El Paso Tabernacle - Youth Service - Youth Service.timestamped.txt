[43:26] India
[43:29] to spread the
[43:31] gospel the region known as a was
[43:34] comprised of hundreds of
[43:38] tribes who were primitive and aggressive
[43:40] Head
[43:43] Hunters into these hostile and
[43:46] aggressive
[43:49] communities came a a group of
[43:52] missionaries from the American Baptist
[43:55] missions
[43:58] spreading the message of love peace and
[44:00] hope in Jesus
[44:05] Christ naturally they were not
[44:09] welcom one missionary succeeded in
[44:12] converting a man his wife and two
[44:17] children this man's Faith proved
[44:22] contagious and many villagers began to
[44:25] accept Christianity
[44:30] angry the The Village Chief summoned all
[44:33] the
[44:37] villagers he then called the family who
[44:40] had first converted to renounce their
[44:42] faith in
[44:47] public or face
[44:51] execution moved by the Holy
[44:55] Spirit the man and
[44:57] said I have decided to follow
[45:03] [Music]
[45:05] Jesus enraged at the refusal of the
[45:10] man the chief ordered his archers to
[45:14] arrow down his two
[45:18] children as both boys were laying
[45:21] twitching on the
[45:23] floor the chief
[45:25] asked will you deny your
[45:29] faith you have lost both your
[45:33] children you will lose your wife
[45:36] too but the man
[45:39] replied though none joins
[45:42] me no none go with
[45:45] me till I will
[45:50] follow the chief was beside
[45:54] himself with Fury and ordered his wife
[45:57] wife to be
[46:00] killed in a moment she joined her two
[46:03] children in
[46:06] death now he asks the last
[46:09] time I will give you one more
[46:12] opportunity to deny your
[46:16] faith in the face of
[46:20] death the man said the final memor
[46:23] memorable lines
[46:27] the cross before me the World Behind Me
[46:32] no turning back I won't turn
[46:36] back he was shot dead just like the rest
[46:39] of his
[46:41] family but with their deaths brought a
[46:46] miracle the chief who had ordered the
[46:51] killings was moved by the faith of the
[46:55] man he wondered
[46:58] why should this
[46:59] man his wife and two children die for a
[47:05] man who lived in a far away
[47:09] land on another
[47:12] continent some 2,000 years
[47:14] ago there must be some remarkable
[47:20] power behind the family's
[47:23] faith and I too want to taste that faith
[47:28] in a spontaneous confession of
[47:32] Faith he declared I too belong to Jesus
[47:37] Christ when the crowd heard this from
[47:40] the mouth of their
[47:44] Chief the whole village accepted Christ
[47:47] as their lord and
[47:53] savior the song is based on the last
[47:59] words of Noam a man from the G
[48:06] tribe it is
[48:08] today the song of the
[48:12] people I have
[48:17] [Applause]

[1:06:36] to them at one
[1:06:39] time these people like believe the
[1:06:43] sign I always say I always say this
[1:06:47] Here's your sign you're
[1:06:50] stupid amen right amen you have to call
[1:06:55] out the demon of what it
[1:06:57] is when when Jesus prayed for the man he
[1:07:02] said these words th dumb and stupid
[1:07:13] Spirit you're the
[1:07:19] translator this is where what it's all
[1:07:21] at they put on their
[1:07:24] headphones and listen to heavy metal
[1:07:28] music before they start studying the
[1:07:34] word and that anointing is coming from
[1:07:37] the fourth
[1:07:40] dimension and it's coming to come to
[1:07:43] your mind
[1:07:44] first but it does not want to stay with
[1:07:47] your
[1:07:48] mind it wants to get to your
[1:07:51] heart it wants to get to the
[1:07:54] throne it to get to where the real you
[1:07:58] are so when you go and you start you
[1:08:01] start looking at the
[1:08:03] magazines young guys you look at
[1:08:07] magazines of
[1:08:09] girls and you say oh that's a pretty
[1:08:11] girl that girl don't
[1:08:15] exist it's a figment of somebody's
[1:08:19] imagination and everybody says Oh What a
[1:08:22] Beautiful
[1:08:23] Woman the only beautiful Beau woman I
[1:08:27] see is the Bride of the
[1:08:30] lordes cuz she's vested in the
[1:08:33] glory she's rested vested in the power
[1:08:38] of what Jesus has done in transforming
[1:08:40] her
[1:08:42] life if I could just be that woman if I
[1:08:46] could just be that man let me tell you
[1:08:49] what you have to be a
[1:08:51] Christian first of all you got to
[1:08:54] decide what what am I going to

[1:08:59] decided since I was 5 years old I've
[1:09:03] been preaching behind a
[1:09:05] desk I've been preaching the gospel for
[1:09:07] more than 55 years I have decided to
[1:09:13] follow
[1:09:17] Jesus I have no
[1:09:20] plan
[1:09:22] that's I believe that God sent fourth
[1:09:26] brother William
[1:09:29] Mar he is the
[1:09:32] Elijah he's the seventh
[1:09:36] angel he's the only one that God himself
[1:09:40] took a picture

[1:09:47] one that added
[1:09:52] water that has water
[1:09:56] so here we are let me tell you people on
