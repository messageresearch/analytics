[24:58] I won't take too long
[25:03] um but this testimony starts but I said
[25:06] testimonial comenza a long seven years
[25:08] ago
[25:09] [Music]
[25:10] it actually only happened about a year
[25:12] ago but it did start technically at
[25:14] seven years ago pero Technica
[25:20] uh long story short when I story alaga
[25:23] corta I've been working towards my
[25:25] teacher's license
[25:28] and to do it you got to take five tests
[25:31] [Music]
[25:33] and each one tends to be harder than the
[25:35] last
[25:36] time
[25:38] but the last test I had to take
[25:43] the hardest
[25:45] was the most urgent
[25:48] El Mas
[25:50] porgente so naturally I waited a year to
[25:53] do it
[25:55] and I took so long that I was pretty
[25:58] much down to the last second
[26:00] okay
[26:03] Segundo
[26:06] and
[26:08] because of that
[26:10] the stakes were extremely high
[26:16] yeah I think
[26:20] and by extremely high I mean I might
[26:22] have not been employed if I didn't pass
[26:24] was he limited
[26:28] so I studied for a week
[26:32] and I took the test
[26:35] and I was not very confident afterwards
[26:39] it was a lot more difficult than I
[26:41] expected
[26:43] I Was Defeated I went to work the next
[26:45] day yes
[26:49] was moping around
[26:56] wondering if I'd be eating in three
[26:58] months you see

[27:11] these things and she looks at me
[27:14] and she pauses and she goes

[27:22] where I was getting checked
[27:26] I just knew I was the Lord was talking
[27:28] to me he is
[27:35] and she goes then just speak it
[27:38] and I was like you're right
[27:43] because speak it and don't worry about
[27:45] it
[27:47] so I said okay then I passed my test
[27:50] okay
[27:52] so a long month passes
[28:03] and they're like hey check out your test
[28:08] Ament and I said oh no oh no Now's the
[28:13] Time to check my faith
[28:16] but you know I wasn't scared
[28:20] because I wasn't worried about it
[28:24] and I did pass the test
[28:27] and I will remain employed

[35:02] we are thankful that you are watching uh
[35:05] online
[35:07] and I'd like to title this thought
[35:12] when God challenges your faith
[35:19] we'll say it again when God challenges
[35:22] your face
[35:24] and now you can put your name there is
[35:30] the word says
[35:34] it came from verse one all the way to
[35:36] verse four
[35:37] the
[35:40] first verse
[35:51] and the Hand of the Lord was upon me and
[35:54] carried me out in the spirit of the Lord
[35:56] and set me down in the midst of the
[35:58] valley which was full of Bones
[36:01] now capture the next verse
[36:09] the prophet gives some details here he's
[36:12] very specific when he speaks about these
[36:14] bones
[36:26] and caused me to pass by them round
[36:28] about and behold there were very many in
[36:31] the open Valley and low they were very
[36:33] dry
[36:42] and he said unto me son of man can these
[36:45] bones live and and I answered O Lord God
[36:48] thou knowest
[36:50] Prophet is
[36:57] again he said unto me prophesy upon
[37:00] these bones and say unto them all ye Dry
[37:02] Bones hear the word of the Lord let us
[37:05] pray
[37:06] Lord very good evening
[37:11] or our vessels surrendered we we submit
[37:14] them unto youth the Lord speak to us
[37:18] Inspire us

[37:35] our prayer in the name of our Lord Jesus
[37:37] Christ
[37:40] take your seat thank you
[37:42] [Applause]
[37:48] to beginner we like to read what brother
[37:50] Branham says
[37:53] the message Jesus Christ the same
[37:56] yesterday today and forever
[37:59] as we'd like to take the church
[38:06] to the place that we can truly
[38:10] Apostolic see Apostolic times
[38:15] moving in our midst
[38:23] ate
[38:25] doesn't that affirmation seem so
[38:27] tremendous to you
[38:31] we want to take the church
[38:34] now how many wants to go there
[38:37] I am a Christian
[38:39] because I believe this word
[38:42] and because I believe
[38:45] I read
[38:47] what the Holy Spirit
[38:52] when it fella
[38:56] when he fell over 120 individuals in the
[39:00] upper room
[39:04] brother Grandma speaks about
[39:05] time yeah
[39:09] you can all stick apart where brother
[39:10] Brown says yes yes
[39:12] if that same tree
[39:15] produces a brand
[39:18] it would have to pray
[39:21] the same time
[39:25] I want to know what kind they produced
[39:28] in the beginning
[39:30] when we read The Acts of the Apostles
[39:33] then I begin to see
[39:36] the work of the works of God
[40:26] foreign
[40:31] who he is
[40:35] in his church
[40:37] that's what it Purdue
[40:39] now I asked
[40:42] brother uh Thomas said one time
[40:46] is
[40:48] being preached
[40:51] show me where
[40:54] show me where
[40:57] is
[41:01] now look at the title when God
[41:06] challenges your faith
[41:09] let me corner you a little bit
[41:13] by the throat foreign
[42:12] [Applause]
[42:36] it is not a business of men
[42:47] even your
[42:50] own foreign
[43:31] I want you to capture this right now
[43:35] we the church
[43:39] [Music]
[43:40] now listen
[43:44] has to rise up
[43:46] in the power of God
[43:59] I believe the church is in the
[44:01] conditions
[44:04] to be able to teach deeper things
[44:08] and strip away
[44:15] s now capture this
[44:17] is
[44:24] time is close
[44:28] it's now time to learn
[44:34] but also it is the time
[44:38] to strip away
[44:42] manufacturing
[44:44] you know the word strip away
[44:53] etiquette
[44:55] is
[44:56] to strip away
[45:24] challenges your faith
[45:28] I can see the Seer Ezekiel
[45:36] nothing that frustrates a minister
[45:40] a man of God what
[45:42] then when he sees like Iglesia the
[45:45] church
[45:46] or when he sees the people divided
[45:52] foreign
[46:55] don't think it was just like a parking
[46:57] lot out there
[46:58] no it was a valley
[47:02] that's the size of New Mexico
[47:05] that's how the valley was it is
[47:17] and this Vision impacted the prophet so
[47:20] much
[47:26] he says Ezekiel
[47:30] will these bones live
[47:36] and the prophet could not believe
[47:39] that they could get done
[47:43] if the possibility exists
[48:01] come here
[48:04] can these bones live
[48:07] and Ezekiel said
[48:15] of course
[48:17] oh I believe it speak it
[48:20] the word doesn't say that
[48:23] the prophet stayed silent
[48:28] Señor
[48:41] but hear me
[48:45] prophesy
[48:46] speak to those bones
[48:54] the faith of the Prophet
[48:57] that was the condition of Israel
[49:00] after this Vision
[49:03] you can see the prophet Ezekiel
[49:06] although the people were divided
[49:15] hear the word of the Lord
[49:27] and Ezekiel speaks
[49:30] when God challenges your faith
[49:36] case
[49:39] everyone that is sick hear me
[49:42] listen to this
[49:46] I haven't seen a more difficult case in
[49:49] the Bible
[49:51] with the woman with the blood issue
[49:57] I don't find anything more complicated
[49:59] or more difficult
[50:01] this woman this lady
[50:04] she was in Israelite she was a Jewish
[50:07] woman
[50:09] she was part of the Covenant
[50:11] she had a blessing
[50:15] but because of her condition
[50:19] the very blessing
[50:21] condemned her
[50:24] I've never seen anything like that
[50:27] the very blessing that covers
[50:30] the very blessing condemned her
[50:34] now this woman
[50:37] is
[50:41] never took no foreign
[50:59] evil because she had heard
[51:01] that God the one she served
[51:06] had done Miracles
[51:08] she'd go to the other positions
[51:13] I'm sorry
[51:20] her condition was worse
[51:23] but she would not take notes
[51:27] she still took ahold
[51:30] what the most miserable life
[51:37] without having Fellowship
[51:42] all these years without being too good
[51:50] Fellowship for love
[51:54] what are the most Miserables
[51:58] what a suffering is
[52:08] [Music]
[52:12] the circumstances
[52:16] but she never took no for an answer
[52:21] Hallelujah
[52:24] when Jesus arrived on the scene
[52:27] she had heard
[52:30] all the great things he had done but
[52:33] you know what the worst thing was
[52:36] she did not even have the rights
[52:40] to go into a prayer line
[52:44] she did not even have that right
[52:49] forbid her to do that
[52:55] when God challenges your faith
[52:59] she said what do I do
[53:02] kill me they'll kill me
[53:06] but she never took no for an answer
[53:10] the Bible says
[53:13] she said
[53:15] she believed
[53:18] if I can only touch
[53:52] when God challenges
[53:54] this woman said
[53:56] foreign
[54:41] Peter says
[55:17] when God challenges your faith
[55:23] foreign
[55:35] one of the most tremendous things
[55:39] brother Brown says
[55:43] let us rise up in the power of God
[56:03] that's why we come to church
[56:18] that went over
[56:21] and touch God
[56:24] here comes Jesus here comes
[56:28] the faith was so strong
[56:31] that is
[56:42] when God challenges your faith
[56:53] it is the testimony of Cornelius
[56:57] the first Gentiles
[57:00] fortunately he was a military man yeah
[57:09] well who has served
[57:13] Cornelius he was a centurion
[57:16] the scriptures yes in verse 10.
[57:20] you can read it at home
[57:26] it was around the ninth hour
[57:31] look how the salvation of Cornelius
[57:33] begins
[57:36] began in a supernatural way
[57:39] the Bible says an angel
[57:44] and turn into the house of Cornelius
[57:49] entering into the house
[57:54] I'm worthy to enter into this into this
[57:57] house
[57:58] [Music]
[58:00] I don't see anything dirty here I come
[58:07] listen to the words that he says
[58:11] said your prayers
[58:19] there's no need to pay for the ties in
[58:21] the New Testament
[58:23] ality
[58:25] may the Lord rebuke the devil
[58:28] friendas your your arms
[58:33] your prayers
[58:36] they have come to the presence of God
[58:39] now listen
[58:41] it was the first time
[58:46] that an angel visits
[58:49] Sent From Heaven
[58:51] or salvation Here Comes Cornelius
[58:55] is
[59:01] that you may proceed how it will be
[59:03] indicated to you
[59:06] and he tells him about Peter
[59:09] he tells them
[59:11] and what house he will be in Manda and
[59:15] he sends for him
[59:20] the conversion of a gentile
[59:25] Cornelio Manda this is
[59:29] one of his servants of confidence
[59:33] he sends for Peter
[59:37] in the instances men enter into the
[59:40] house
[59:41] the Bible says
[59:44] holy spirit spoke to Peter yeah he said
[59:47] he said go with them
[59:50] I have sentences
[1:00:01] [Applause]
[1:00:19] and
[1:00:23] how we should fix things
[1:00:29] I'll tell you something Brothers
[1:00:32] all this that I have just told you
[1:00:36] it was it was the easiest part
[1:00:39] but here comes the difficult part
[1:00:43] is the most complicated
[1:00:45] remember when God challenges your faith
[1:00:49] the scripture says
[1:00:52] that when Peter arrived to Cornelius
[1:00:54] house
[1:00:58] Cornelius had prepared his house
[1:01:01] to receive him
[1:01:07] to receive him
[1:01:11] Cornelius
[1:01:16] would have never received the Holy
[1:01:18] Spirit
[1:01:20] if he had not received
[1:01:23] whom God had sent
[1:01:26] that's the most difficult part
[1:01:36] John chapter 6 13 20. teacher
[1:01:42] what can we do to do the works of God
[1:01:46] receive whom he has sent
[1:01:51] right
[1:01:56] the Bible says
[1:01:59] that when Peter began to speak
[1:02:02] there was so much respect
[1:02:05] I can imagine Cornelius
[1:02:09] must have called out his men of
[1:02:10] confidence
[1:02:13] to the presence of the Lord
[1:02:17] he sent for his people
[1:02:22] chapter 10 of the book of Acts
[1:02:25] and I can imagine
[1:02:27] Familia listen family foreign
[1:03:08] now
[1:03:57] well Remus
[1:04:01] we can eat this this piece of bread
[1:04:08] when God challenges your faith
[1:04:12] listen
[1:04:15] the last 12 years
[1:04:18] brother Branham says Jesus Jesus
[1:04:24] perfect perfect
[1:04:27] because he believed
[1:04:30] who he was he was the word
[1:04:36] that made him have perfect faith
[1:04:39] brother Bradham says no now let me make
[1:04:43] a turn
[1:04:46] for the last 12 years
[1:04:50] it has been so outstanding
[1:04:55] now let me help your faith
[1:04:58] and I say this to help your faith
[1:05:02] for the last 12 years
[1:05:05] it has been outstanding
[1:05:08] that the Holy Spirit
[1:05:10] has given me the privilege to be able to
[1:05:15] go
[1:05:17] the missionary trips in the spirit
[1:05:34] to be able to bring a portion of
[1:05:37] information
[1:05:43] can have success
[1:05:51] a bit of information
[1:05:54] the last 12 years
[1:05:57] that produce that has produced Faith
[1:06:01] because I believe
[1:06:04] what is my position
[1:06:08] speaks of my position that gives me
[1:06:12] Faith
[1:06:14] to the Believers
[1:06:19] what the word
