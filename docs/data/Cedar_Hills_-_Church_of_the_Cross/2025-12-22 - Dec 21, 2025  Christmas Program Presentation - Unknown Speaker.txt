First and foremost, God bless you to each and every one of you. I hope you have a wonderful play today. To all of our staff of Sunday school teachers and their helpers, God bless you for all your hard work and dedication. to the congregation. God bless you to each and every one of you. Have a very merry Christmas and we'll see you all when we get home. Hello children. Just want to say first and foremost, God bless you to each and every one of you. [applause] I just &gt;&gt; [snorts] &gt;&gt; Hello. Hello and welcome to the Cedar Hills Church of the Cross children's Christmas drama. We are all familiar with the nativity story, but have you ever wondered about the stars that led the three mages? And yes, you heard correctly. I said stars because there are three stars. Today we are going to get a little glimpse of what the stars may have seen. So deacons, pass out the popcorn and candy to the congregation as we go on this journey that took place over 2,000 years ago. Wait a minute. Cancel that deacons. There's no eating church. Anyways, we hope you enjoy our show. &gt;&gt; [applause] &gt;&gt; Is it ever going to be time yet? We've been waiting over 700 years ever since they prophesied. &gt;&gt; Is this thing even working? Maybe it needs to be charged. Apple is supposed to have a long battery life. &gt;&gt; Wake me up when Gabriel gets here. &gt;&gt; Guess what, everyone? It's time. Really? It's time. &gt;&gt; The son of the most high, Emanuel, is to be born. &gt;&gt; Yes, he'll be born very soon. As a matter of fact, I just finished talking to Mary, the young lady who was chosen to give birth to the Messiah. &gt;&gt; Okay, calm down. Calm down. You do know what you're all supposed to do, right? &gt;&gt; Are you kidding me? Of course, we know what to do. &gt;&gt; We've been practicing since before the foundation of the world. &gt;&gt; You've been looking over the banister all this time. Now, it's time to go into action. When the Messiah is born, you go to work shining bright for the three magi. &gt;&gt; All right, I got you. We won't let you down. &gt;&gt; Don't forget now, when the son of God is born in Bethlehem, that is your cue. It is very important that you leave the three magi. &gt;&gt; All right, I got you. teacher to give her. Hello. Okay, there we go. The magi's foot are for gold, frankincense, and mr to the son of god. God. The gold represented that he is the eternal king. Frankincense because he is a sweet smelling savor to God. Myrrh was given because it was a costly but bitter herb which represented his great supreme sacrifice. It was God, deity, and service to die. &gt;&gt; How much longer, Joseph? I don't think I could travel much further. The baby's coming soon. &gt;&gt; Hold on, Mary. We're almost there. &gt;&gt; As soon as they come to a corner, we attack. &gt;&gt; Wait. Everyone who passes this way is basically a sitting duck. There's no room for them to run. &gt;&gt; Uhoh. &gt;&gt; Remember, go for the jewels and any coins that you find. Don't waste time with anything else. &gt;&gt; Duh. It's not my first robbery. Look at the perfect target. A man and his pregnant wife. It's going to be like taking candy from a baby. &gt;&gt; Get ready. As soon as they come to a corner, we attack. Where did they go? They were right there a second ago. It's like they disappeared into thin air. &gt;&gt; How am I supposed to know? You were supposed to be watching. &gt;&gt; You were supposed to be watching. It's like there was a shield guarding them. &gt;&gt; Wait, look. What are those? &gt;&gt; Oh no. Lion tracks. Let's get out of here. What now? First robbers. Now look, there's lions. &gt;&gt; Don't worry. The angel of the Lord is in control of the situation. Look, &gt;&gt; girl. [laughter] &gt;&gt; I wonder why God used &gt;&gt; [applause] &gt;&gt; I wonder why God used such a small animal like a squirrel. It's almost like it would have an important part to play in the future. Like a prophet would need one ladder or something. We should have known that God had everything under control the whole time. After all, the angel of the Lord in campus run about those that fear him and deliverth him. The Roman Emperor Caesar Augustus made a decree that all people were required to travel to the place they were born to register to be counted. When they arrived, Joseph and Mary went from in to inn looking for a place to rest. &gt;&gt; Yes. How can I help you? &gt;&gt; I need a room, please. My wife is about to have a baby, and every in we stop at is full. &gt;&gt; Sarah, where are you? I'm right in here. There are right in here. Are you sure we don't have any more rooms available? &gt;&gt; Are you kidding me? We've got to pack in. We don't even have any more air mattresses available. You even gave away my room. Looks like I'm sleeping in the broom closet this weekend. Sheesh. Someone's cranky. So many people have come because of the senses. I'm sorry, but my inn is full also. But I do have Never mind. &gt;&gt; Please tell us we really need a place to stay. &gt;&gt; I do have a stable. I warn you, it's nothing fancy. You'll have to share with my animals. You're welcome to use it, though. &gt;&gt; Thank you for the offer. We'll keep looking for a room. &gt;&gt; Please, Joseph, I need to rest now. The baby's coming soon. &gt;&gt; Mary, how can the kings of kings be born in a stable? You should be born in a palace, but at the very least a room in an inn. &gt;&gt; God's ways are higher than us. Stay we find there isn't much time left. &gt;&gt; I need some help in here. There are 20 people waiting for cleaning sheets and I haven't started on dinner yet. &gt;&gt; I'm coming. Goodness, it's so hard to find good help these days. Well, the staples right down the road if you choose to use it. At least it'll be warmer than the streets. I'll even throw a couple warm meals later if you choose to stay. Best luck to both of you. to go. Excuse me. &gt;&gt; [screaming] &gt;&gt; Fear not. We bring good news. Your savior is born in the city of David who is Christ the Lord. &gt;&gt; You'll find him wrapped in swaddling cloths laying in a manger. From [music] heaven's known to a stable floor. The son of God to a virgin [music] born. This tiny child [singing and music] brings hope to all. Behold [singing] the king has the king [singing] as a god of the world. He gave his [music] only the [music] king of angels to the sky with the [singing] world [music] [music] [singing] dance and saw our king. Shepherds heal and the angels sing [music] for David has entered. Hey, [music] [music] [singing] [music] heat. [music] Hey. Oh my [music] [singing] god [singing and music] upon the earth [music] united [singing] by our savior's day. My father [music] [music] has &gt;&gt; [music] [singing] &gt;&gt; is always [music] [singing] the Precision for the world. Behold [music] the king [singing] of [music] [applause] &gt;&gt; Did you all see what I saw? &gt;&gt; Yes. It was a miracle. &gt;&gt; Yes, it was a miracle. Let's go see the savior. We said watching boring. Oh yeah. See, I told you it was about to get good. This is what we've been waiting for. &gt;&gt; Not only are we guiding, but we're witnessing. &gt;&gt; Meanwhile, hundreds of miles away, the magi are on their journey following their stars to see Jesus. These magi were king of the orient who studied the stars. Each had noticed in their country that one was brighter and different than all the others. Each of the magi began following that star that they saw until those three stars merged into one star over Jerusalem when Jesus was born. The three wise men met when those traveling together with the same purpose, finding he that was born king of the Jews. Look at this ancient Hebrew writing by Balum, &gt;&gt; one of the prophets. It says here, "They shall rise a star to Jacob." &gt;&gt; And we've been studying this star for months now, and we know it defies all the laws of the solar system. This is confirmation we have been looking for. The bright star reflects a greater light, a heavenly being. Look, the star moved again. &gt;&gt; Wow, I can't believe it. In all of my years of studying the stars, I have never seen anything like this. &gt;&gt; Well, it did move after all. Let's go to &gt;&gt; Did you just hear those guys? They probably just saw a star starlink satellite &gt;&gt; or a fallen star &gt;&gt; or an airplane. &gt;&gt; What? An airplane? What's that? &gt;&gt; I don't know. I just made it up. [laughter] &gt;&gt; Well, it did move after all. Let's go to Jerusalem. It is the religious capital of the world after all. &gt;&gt; You're right. I bet everyone in the city is talking about the king of the Jews. News this big has to be going viral over there. &gt;&gt; Well, let's go. If let's go to Jerusalem. We can get there in about a few nights. Hello. Have you heard about the child that spurn the king of the Jews? &gt;&gt; King of the Jews? A child? What are you talking about? You had better be careful. This is this is King's Herod's territory. You must be troublemakers. &gt;&gt; We don't want any trouble. We just want to pay homage to the King of Kings. &gt;&gt; Yep. They're looking for trouble. Don't you know King Herod? Spies are everywhere. Why would you want to put yourselves in danger? &gt;&gt; Sorry, but even talking about other kings is chasing against King's Herods. We better get out of here now. &gt;&gt; Exactly what I was thinking. If you were smart, you would turn back and go home. The golden Through mountains and valleys they followed the star, the star of most [music] rad and night. All right, you with me? The wise men rejoiced with all of their hearts to behold. Come on, Richie. Such a beautiful [music] sign. I don't think you heard me tonight. But through mountains and [music] valleys they followed the star. [music] The star of most radiant light. The wise men rejoice WITH ALL OF THEIR HEART TO BEHOLD SUCH A BEAUTIFUL. WHEN THEY SAW THE STAR, THEY rejoiced [music] with rejoice. WHEN THEY SAW THE STAR, THEY rejoice with great [music] joy. When they saw the star, they rejoice with great joy. They rejoice with [music] great joy. When they saw they rejoice with rejoice. [music] When they saw Oh, when they s [music] they rejoice with rejoice. They rejoice with extreme rejoice. I have SEEN THE STAR. I REJOICE WITH REJOICE. [music] I HAVE SEEN THE STAR. I REJOICE WITH GREAT JOY. [music] I have seen the star. I rejoice with great joy. I with [music] exceeding great joy. They rejoice [music] with exceeding great joy. We've been traveling so long to find you, my lord. We followed a star and it led us to you. &gt;&gt; Wow. I can't believe it. Wait, no. &gt;&gt; Wait, hold up. We travel from seven lands not knowing we be following the same store that would lead us to the family following Messiah. We've each brought him gifts. &gt;&gt; I have brought him the finest and purest gold for he is the king of heaven and earth and it represents his deity. &gt;&gt; I bring him frankincense because he serves a sermon. He smells sweet to God and he will be in a service to his people. My gift is my because he will pay a great sacrifice. Now, [applause] now I know they come sent from God. Remember the dream I had, Mary? And the angel Gabriel said that Jesus would save all all his pe all his people from their sins. &gt;&gt; Yes, I remember. You told me. &gt;&gt; Look at him just to believe. He is the promised Messiah. Look at him play with his blocks just like an ordinary boy. &gt;&gt; It is an amazing sight to see. We must return to our homelands now. You see, we have been traveling here for 2 years. &gt;&gt; Really? Well, we thank you for your gifts. May God be with you as you travel home. Thank you for your obedience and following the stars. After the wise men presented Jesus with their gifts and they and as they prepared to leave, they were warned in a dream not to pass by King Herod's kingdom as they journeyied home. &gt;&gt; You know, I don't trust King Herod. I even had a dream last night to not pass through Judea. King Herod is a bad man, and I think he will not hesitate to kill anyone that feels is a threat to his throne. &gt;&gt; Yes, I had the same dream. Let's go home another way and avoid King Herod. We must not give any information about Jesus. So the wise men split up and went their separate ways, each to his own country, spreading the word that the prophecies of the Messiah had been fulfilled. Now, that was an amazing story worth waiting for, right? &gt;&gt; I told &gt;&gt; I told you it'd be. You've lived up to your word and led the wise men straight to Jesus. &gt;&gt; I told you I would. At times, I wasn't sure how the story would play out, but God had planned it all so perfectly. Keep looking over the banister and see how amazing Jesus's life would be. what I wouldn't give to go down to earth and be a follower of Jesus. &gt;&gt; I can't wait. I get a front row seat. How could anyone disbelieve the son of God? &gt;&gt; We will see who will decide to follow Jesus. But just just wait. This is just the beginning. Just wait until he begins to heal the sick, save the lost, and redeem his people. What did you call it again a couple years ago? Ah, yes. This is the greatest story ever told. &gt;&gt; [applause] [cheering] &gt;&gt; Careful. Please [music] not. [singing] [music] [music] [singing] [music] I want to wish you a merry [music] Christmas. I want to wish you [singing] a merry Christmas. I want to wish you a merry Christmas. [music] [music] Oh my [music] god. [music] [singing] [music] [singing] [music] [singing] [music] Merry Christmas. I want to wish you a merry Christmas. I want to wish you a [music] merry Christmas. [singing] [music] Merry Christmas from the bottom [music] of my heart. &gt;&gt; MERRY CHRISTMAS [cheering] and a happy new year.

What a beautiful name it is. [singing] Nothing [music] compares to this. What a beautiful name it is. The name of [music] Jesus and death could not hold you.

Do you [singing] see what I see? As far as I [singing] dancing in the night with [music] a tail as big as a K. With a tail [singing] as [music] big as a K. In the little lamb [singing] to the shepher. [music] Do you [singing] hear what I hear ringing [music] through the sky? Shepher. [singing] [music] Do you hear what I love? Heat. Heat. [music and singing] As big [music] as the sea. The shepherd [music and singing] falls to the mighty king. Oh, do you [singing and music] know what I know? [music] In your palace [singing] my dec.

Clap of praise. And you may be seated. [music] &gt;&gt; [crying] &gt;&gt; an author. once said and it holds with truth that life must be understood backwards. What an impact to see the life of Christ from the cross back to the manger. We behold only the end of the beginning. We behold the sacrifice given led up from miraculous events placed perfectly in his life. Eternal life in every step. Every person was impacted by his presence. From the Roman soldiers at the cross to his name being spoken which brought a dead [music] baby to life. Who is this? Our creator, the greatest gift given to humankind. This is Jesus. Behold. Okay. Behold a story more than words, for it's written within. A story of where we're going and also where [music] we've been. One that beckons its listeners to come up a bit higher. A journey where impossibilities form and transpire. Impossibilities to the carnal mind which deem it non-factual. But the spirit proclaims its truth for those supernatural. How else can you explain [music] a lion that can become a lamb? Or why God would choose a little town like that of Bethlehem? Can the past be our future or the future our past? Could the last become first and the first become last? How can a man die [music] and yet live again? Or a man be so innocent yet covered in sin? [music] How can a powerful king also be called lowly? or a night [music] followed by a baby massacre also be holy? Can a baby hold the promise to save the whole earth? Or is it more likely for a [music] virgin to give birth? So if it's all impossible, why do we know it to be true? Because this story took place [music] just for me and for you. &gt;&gt; One of a king that left all of glory. Born for death just to rewrite your story. If you think the wise men rejoiced [music] when they saw the star, just wait till the believer realizes exactly who they are. &gt;&gt; A story where impossible is a reality for each believer to unfold. And if it's his story, then it's your story. &gt;&gt; Now come behold. &gt;&gt; [music] &gt;&gt; Heat. [music] Heat. [music] &gt;&gt; [music] [music] &gt;&gt; Behold [singing] the lamb [music] of God. who takes [singing] on the pain of [music] the world. The Christ, [music] God's only son, the atonement [singing and music] for sin, crucified, raised again. Behold [singing] the lamb of God. I hold [singing] him. I behold [music and singing] him. Come [singing] behold him Jesus. [music] [singing] Come behold [music] him. Come behold [singing] him. Come before [music and singing] him. Jesus [music] behold [music] the lamb of God. &gt;&gt; Through the [singing and music] veil of his flesh we draw near. our [music] savior, our [singing] priest and our lord who came down [singing] as [music] the father [singing and music] of your &gt;&gt; [singing and music] &gt;&gt; the lamb [music] [music and singing] [music] Jesus. &gt;&gt; [music] [singing] &gt;&gt; behold [music] [singing] [music] [singing] him. [music] [singing] Behold [music] the [singing] lamb of God. The power [music and singing] of death [music] [singing] in glorious power [singing and music] of scripture and prophy. &gt;&gt; [music] [singing] &gt;&gt; and behold [music] the lamb of God. [singing] Heat. Heat. [music] [singing] [music] Yeah. Heat.

You sacrifice your time. You sacrifice a lot of things. But we are so so content tonight this holiday season. We we thank the Lord for it. We we just want to say this and I want to read out of God's gifts always find their appropriate places for their places. He says, "Now I want to wish each and every one of you a merry Christmas." Would you turn to your neighbor and say, "Neighbor, I wish you a very merry Christmas." &gt;&gt; That's what we want to do. We want to wish every one of you Merry, merry Christmas. &gt;&gt; May the great Christmas present, &gt;&gt; the first one &gt;&gt; and the only and the original &gt;&gt; and the only one there is &gt;&gt; Jesus Christ be aresh in your heart tonight. May the Holy Spirit come to you and bring you ministering gifts &gt;&gt; and things from God. A gift that you might live a better life. That's what I want. I would rather have the life of Christ in me to live sweet and victorious &gt;&gt; than I would all the gifts of healing and of prophecies and all the other gifts. Just give me Jesus. Let me live the life. The life is what I want to live. I want to live so that others will know. That's my desire at Christmas. &gt;&gt; And I pray that it's your desire and that God will give us his desire. We won't have service on Wednesday. I want you to enjoy your families, friends, loved ones. And but merry merry Christmas. Or if I can say the way that the prophet of God said, Not exactly merry Christmas, but God's blessings of Christmas be upon you all. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. And amen. Would you stand to your feet? It's been wonderful being here tonight. We thank the Lord for God's word this morning. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And I'm glad I'm a Christian. Amen. Would you bow your heads as we approach the author, &gt;&gt; Father Almighty God, &gt;&gt; Lord, [music] I'm asking tonight, Lord, &gt;&gt; for every person that's here, Lord, if there's anyone here, Lord, that does not know you, that doesn't know this great gift, has never received it, &gt;&gt; I pray that you would go to each heart, Lord. that you would bless them, Lord. That you would show yourself to them. What else can we do but give our lives to you, Lord? You gave our your life so that we could live. And now, Lord, we give our life back to you, Lord. Do with us as you would, Lord. Once again, I pray a blessing Lord on all the children, young people or the helpers. &gt;&gt; Bless them this time, Lord. Lord, in all that they've gone through and done to be a blessing to your people here and around the world. I pray for all the churches, the missions that we that are out there, Lord, Lord, that you would bless them in this time. Lord provide food, Lord, for those that are in need. Lord, provide all that they have need of. Lord, &gt;&gt; Lord, I would give you all the honor, the glory. Thank you once again for becoming man so that we could now become you, Lord. Thank you. Now, as each as we go to our separate homes, may your blessings follow each person, Lord. We thank you from the bottom of our hearts in the precious name of Jesus Christ. We want to just say &gt;&gt; we thank you there was many many people there in Uganda that had no food. Some had run out already. Praying to God for a miracle for them to eat. We were able to send from the church, send them a wonderful offering, to be able to feed all those people that were in need. And so we thank you and for this Christmas, they're eating because God put it on your heart to help them. Thank you for that. May God bless you. [applause] Amen. And amen. Until we meet again, may the Lord be with you. God bless you. [music] &gt;&gt; Oh God, rest [music] ye the merry gentle man.
