Amen in Psalms chapter 19 verse 1. the heavens declare the glory of God and the firmament showeth his handiwork s Manos day and today utter a speech and night on tonight showeth knowledge Lord Jesus we just thank you for the opportunity Lord opportunity we just ask that you would just come down lord and you would just Minister Grace unto the hearers this evening and if we could just hear one word from you Lord Jesus may it reach that soul that you have called us here tonight yeah I see you take everything under your control we do it for the honor and the glory because we ask you in Jesus name Jesus amen and amen you may be seated I'm going to ask the gentleman you could go ahead I have a short short video a couple minutes we're going to play before sets the the foundation for the small thoughts you guys go ahead the sun gives us warmth and light it is the fuel of life without the energy of the sun almost nothing grows thrives lives son is a monster a Planet Killer and we don't see that side of the sun down here but eight astronauts with over a thousand days in space between them can show us how being up there help them understand the sun's bright Fury [Music] it's got an incredible amount of power which you really appreciate when you go out in Space the sun can give life and it can destroy life given the amount of radiation from the Sun there shouldn't be life on the surface of the Earth we shouldn't be here the Earth Shields us in a suit of armor [Music] and the way she does it but that's not all these molten insides are full of iron and nickel Rising falling spinning constantly Melting Furnace and all that churning metal creates its own magnetic field [Music] [Music] this magnetic field stretches as far as 400 000 miles into space surrounding the entire planet it is a massive force field and it helps deflect the deadly radiation that destroyed Mars for the most part our magnetic field is invisible but when the sun flares up we get to see it in action we call it the Aurora pretty much on everyone's bucket list but in space see it in an entirely different way [Applause] [Music] I saw this green clothes almost like a person dancing it was this shape of these forearms that were moving as we went over the leaves and all of them all of the colors enormous ghost of a curtain a curtain you're not just seeing it with your eyes you're you're feeling it you're feeling it with your heart as well it's it's a part of you [Music] when we look down at the Aurora all the more beautiful because we know that we're looking at our planet keeping us safe from the Sun [Applause] UV radiation breaks down DNA turns healthy cells cancers we were hit by the full force of the sun plants would be sterilized microscopic life would be sterilized life couldn't be sustained on the surface of the Earth [Music] Sun yes just when you thought you were somebody after watching that none of us should even be here [Music] anybody know what the Aurora is this one's for you also known as the Northern Lights how many have seen the Northern Lights how many have seen him from space amen this this Aurora light or the Northern Lights Del Norte there's this uh happens usually through March through April it is and September through October and I could go into detail of the particles and ions and all that but to save time the number one place to view the Northern Lights majority of people would say Alaska in Alaska but the number one place is known as the heart of the Aurora principals and that that's found in tromoso Norway yes I don't think it's it's by coincidence that that's where our brother martin our brother brothers and sisters are in there in Norway is brother Branham so we see him in the circle bow of green amber color um this greenish what what does green represent life green is is the Evergreen always stays green what does it mean that God has promised and he took a oath back there in Genesis another message he says follow the compass uh he says I was standing there in the North Pole a few years ago the Northern Lights sweeping yes and he says anywhere that Compass will point right straight to that magnetic pole is it'll guide you North every time and he says it will Point towards Jesus Christ just as certain as I'm sitting in this church today now I'm just going to tell tell a little little story those of you who have who have read it in in messages and the life story The the life story uh has a little bit more details as I told Brother Carlos I'll bring the wood and you bring the fire Bros so brother Bradham is in Toledo Ohio in Toledo Ohio he just finished uh he's preaching five consecutive nights five nights in a row it's the peak of Summer yes about 80 to 100 degrees and about 70 percent humidity and he preaches five nights in a row like this is anybody who is who's ever been uh on the east east coast you know the humidity is is nasty so brother uh I think I believe his brother Ern Baxter uh tells brother Brandon I'll I'll go ahead and preach for you tonight brother Branham and you could get some rest so brother Brown says yes I'll I'll thank you I'll take that rest for for time to pray and and prepare for the next the next service so around noon time brother Branham gets hungry so he he goes to the restaurant where he's been eating restaurant and it's closed yesterday so he goes across the street sees another restaurant and as soon as he walks in he can't believe his eyes he sees a police officer with his arm around a girl putting coins into a slot Machina and brother Branham is is is he can't believe his eyes because at that time gambling was illegal in Ohio he looks to this side Mira is a young girl about 18 years old and uh she's got alcohol in her hand and there's there's two young boys with her okay and they're they're uh really Brandon puts it he they're fawning over her yeah staring at her and they like her now you know and anyways so he uh he he says this this little girl ought to be in church he looks to his other side and he sees an elderly woman with two elderly men on those Hombres now the way he puts it is he says that that's some that's somebody's Grandma there yeah she's about 65 years old she's got blue hair she's got blue eyeshadow uh somebody's grandma hello hola and he's he's in disgust and he says is this is this the world that Rebecca and Sarah have to be raised in yeah he was disgusted then all of a sudden the Lord comes down whether Bantam goes in the corner yeah he sees a vision he sees the world turning this is what he's what he sees yes he sees a red streak going around the whole world he sees Jesus standing there Jesus tells them this the Crimson covers the blood of the Lord Jesus Christ died to save Sinners that is the reason God can't destroy these people is they still have a chance every Mortal being has the right to accept their salvation until the day they die and go beyond that blood if they die without accepting it they are already judged but as long as they're alive they have a right to the tree of life if they will accept it and all of a sudden he sees Jesus taking hits taking hits and he says I believe I'll go closer and see what it is and Jesus says he tells brother Branham Jesus the jerks are caused by the slaps of your sins this is to the prophet where does that leave us and brother brother in life story says he uh he he said surely Lord that I I didn't do that and then he sees Jesus say eBay Jesus every time the sins would hit Jesus Jesus he would say father forgive them forgive him he don't know what he's doing even though you might think you know what you're doing if the holy spirit is not not not guiding you and and Jesus is not resurrected in you Jesus you don't really know what you're doing you might think you know but you don't know brother Bill he sees words on a book and he gets closer to read it his brother Brandon's book is condemned and brother Brandon can't handle it he's shaking he goes to the feet of the Lord Jesus Jesus and he says forgive me I beg of you it is and Jesus gets his fingers and dips him in his side he Jesus Thomas and his fingers across the cover of the book it is and he writes pardoned it is and he throws the book behind him and he says I forgave you but you want to condemn these people oh come on vamos Iglesias and he says you're forgiven but what about her it is talking about the old lady he says she needs the gospel too brother Branham comes too and he's got a different Outlook now he walks over to the old old woman may I sit with you in in and talk to you she goes I got company already he says I didn't mean it like that man yeah this is her attitude changed after that so he begins to talk to her and he says I condemned you in my heart and and he tells her about the vision he just had them and you can start putting those those pictures up so he tells her what he what what he sees the forgiveness and uh she she starts telling brother random her testimony and then she says Branham he said you're not the one holding that Revival here are you yes ma'am that's me she said I've been wanting to go down but but I just I just couldn't bring myself to it [Music] she knew where she got off the off the right path and got back on the wrong path brother Bradham is seeing here yes from Earth the lights look a lot different but as you can see there's the green and there's the red going around the whole world all that a prophet the prophet had seen has and will come to pass and for the first time here astronauts are seeing it and to close here Brother Carlos gets ready tell her sister I don't care what you've done the blood of Jesus Christ is still around you the world is covered over with his blood and it's protecting you from the wrath of God and someday when the breath leaves your body your soul will go out and you'll go beyond this world to a place that blood won't do you any good yeah there will be nothing but judgment and while you still got a chance accept it accept it accept the pardon accepted Jesus will forgive you and and save you Jesus she says do you think he'll have me yeah absolutely he'll have you absolutely will you pray that I could be saved and right there in that Diner now together in parade until the woman accepted her salvation brother Branham stands up he sees the policeman removed his hat and he also was kneeling down in respect his brother Bradham left the restaurant he thought that's right yes don't condemn them give them the gospel there's always got to be death before life that's the only way that brings life is none of us should be here that's what keeps the wrath of God from destroying us yes because when he looks down what does he see so your sins be a Scarlet God bless you [Applause] we find this this evening that we serve a good God is that right and and because this is a a young people's service you guys knew it was a young people's service right it's it's aimed at the young people right so so how many young people I got tonight all right we got a whole bunch of young people yeah man story Lori thank you Lord amen amen all right so so we have a good God right and we all know that God is a good god and that's a good thing to know yes but we heard this morning something tremendous and about about a quarter of the way through my uncle Tommy's message I got kind of nervous because he started preaching my message but I thought to myself as you see like we heard this morning we know that God is good and and we know certain things about the message and we know certain things about brother Brandon and we know great things about our our founding pastor of a bunch of different identities right we we when I was in high school preparatoria I remember there was like two or three groups that you could identify as grupos we had the cool kids and then you had the not cool kids and that was about it yes and then as time went on a little bit I remember my kids and they were in school and there's like the Emos and then there was the glass they're called the gods cause they impressed all blacks and then you have you have the jocks the guys who do all the sports and then you got the Nerds nerds right and then we thought that was like a whole bunch of different identities but now you guys now you guys live in a world where there's hundreds if not thousands of different identities of every shape every color every size and every difference in mix and match in the middle and somehow or another the young people of this day are expected to figure out who they are they live in a world even in a mundo where you can identify as anything I wake up today and I choose what I want to be I would like to identify today as a brontosaurus that was my boy saying people you could identify as a brontosaurus I'm a quail today and I remember that we me and my wife went to a place it's Austin Texas and that was the worst anointing I've ever felt in my entire life because in a place like Austin Texas Austin Texas you can walk down the street as a brontosaurus and nobody will bat an eye nobody looks at you weird but my question to you young people my question for you this evening is what do you identify as when I ask you the question what do you identify as maybe the maybe the answer comes back well I'm I'm I'm so-and-so but the most common one you're going to hear especially if I ask you in here is Cristiano and we identify as a Christiano but you notice the question that always goes out is always the question of what do you identify as yes and you see young people here's the problem because when you approach your identity what it creates a whole bunch of problems it's like when you say to be baptized in the name of Father Son and Holy ghosts so when you ask what do you identify that's the reason that a large majority of the world when you ask people who are transgender is a woman okay what the woman but you see you can't identify what okay without the characteristics because once you get the characteristics that define the thing the question changes and it's no more why so if I asked you the question what do you identify as and you say I'm a Christian Cristiano then my next question to you will be is that like on Wednesdays is that just like on Sundays because what is not who you are what okay is what you do and that's why the world is twisted up people want to be what they want to be and we find Jesus Christ it's an easy answer we're Christians okay what does it mean what does it mean to be a Christian Cristiano anybody what does it mean significa to be like Christo what does that mean s what does it mean who who is he NSL who is he do you know his characteristics do you know what he does do you know all the things that there are to know about him then how do we be a who without understanding all of his characteristics so to understand his characteristics we have to go way way way back we find in the Book of Matthew chapter 16. and verse 14 is and I'm just going to read verse 15. because I want you to notice how Jesus asks his disciples Jesus and he saith unto them but what say ye that I am no right that's why when some said well you're a prophet no that's a what well you're you're maybe a Mighty Man yo sorry you notice that no no all right so when when we figure out we need to figure out we need to figure out who he is and to understand that we go all the way to the Book of Revelation apocalypses and we find out in the Book of Revelations chapter one apocalypse oh and this is such a tremendous book it and everybody gets scared of this book and and the book starts out with a tremendous statement because it tells you said what this book is all about and it tells you say that it is a revelation it is so we we find out in order to understand the who is we have to have an apocalypse give me all looking at me like it's the end of the world do you know what the word apocalypse means the unveiling it has to be revealed right and the only way it can be revealed is if you study the words because you gotta find out because that's what defines you is the book starts out the revelation of Jesus Christ which God gave unto him oh my and then let's go down to the book to chapter four I'm sorry verse four apologize chapter one and verse and I want you to notice this here John to the seven churches Grace be unto you and peace from him which is and which was and which is and from the seven spirits which are before his throne now I want you guys to notice these seven spirits and I know that I know that it sounds a little bit deep okay but I know you guys can get this because when we were in youth we covered some crazy stuff right so these these seven spirits that were Before the Throne these Spirits are the seven spirits of God they're Before the Throne but when John sees him he's on the Isle of passed and these Spirits they begin to unfold themselves and John can see them coming John sees something called the seven that give names who's heard of that the seven names of Jehovah who can name me one who's got one we sang the song this morning who's got one what is it Jehovah jirehobachide right correct so what are these seven spirits what are these seven Redemptive names have to do with anything because when you realize those seven names are the descriptors of who Jesus Christ is they're his characteristics came from the throne they came to John they were so that they could come to brother Brown not that they could be revealed to each and every one of you so that when they ask who are you you'll know who you are when they say who is Jesus Jesus oh that's easy he's Jehovah foreign see how once you start to understand it it all ties together because each one of those Messengers they brought apart they brought apart of the revelation of Jesus Christ and it's a revelation of Jesus Christ for each and every one of you it's him unfolding all of his glory oh that's the Gloria to you guys it's him taking all of his mysteriousness breaking it down through seven messages so that you can understand that the answer to your question is not what yo it's who am I so when they ask you what are you okay well I'm a Christian Cristiano then be a Christian does it sound Christiano as who not as what because when you're a Christian that means that the life that was in Jesus Christ when you're a Christian as what it's just a part-time job it's a part-time occupation it's a job with minimal commitment but when you become Christianity you're a Christian it's because there's a revelation when you plan your life when you think about your future don't get caught up in the what no saying being a Christian is who you are it's not what you are and that's where a lot of the mistakes get made that's where we as many as many times as as even older younger people do you see what I did there right older younger people we make our mistakes we become what we are and no que somos I'm a business owner so you um and that becomes our identity that becomes our life that becomes what we are what we do becomes what we are but that's not who we are our goals should always be to go back to who we are because I'm a Son of God how many sons of God how many daughters of God that is who you are you are a part of Jesus Christ you represent his life so when you conduct yourself on a day-to-day basis you don't conduct yourself from a standpoint of what am I because that's when it becomes a manufactured thing I put on Christianity like I put on a suit when I come to church but then as soon as I leave I can take my Christianity suit off it's because this is only what this is not the who is becomes then that same lies that same gospel that same red blood that goes around the world it doesn't stay out there in the outside of the world anymore [Music] it comes from it's being displayed Here and Now what was out there is who is in here let us stand tonight how many love him young people did you did you get something tonight amen amen let's sing that little song tonight Jehovah jaira [Music] more than enough is he more than enough for you young kids Just Close Your Eyes raise your hands let's worship him tonight [Music] you you are more than enough for me [Music] Jehovah [Music] by your stride I have been set free [Music] Jehovah [Music] if you are with me you you lie [Music] oh my name foreign [Music] once again fella oh Jehovah [Music] [Music] goodness [Music] surprise I have [Music] had the Earth Supply [Music] oh God I need [Music] and you are more [Music] or you are born you are born [Music] brother Ethan let's sing that song by it by when the morning comes let's worship him this evening you know I mean real quick brother Ethan you know how to know if you're having a hard time you know the first thing the devil will attack the very first thing is your worship that's the very first thing that he goes up because he knows that if he can stop you from singing the Praises stop your hands clapping stop your arms racing [Music] then he can break you down so who's got worship who's got your worship still it's a hard time it's a rough time but as long as you got your worship again you can come back from anything you want to know your way back tonight that's your way back that's your way back come on you ready [Music] [Music]
