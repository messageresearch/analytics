to him for the flood if you believe tonight raise your hands and sing all these are possible only Oh [Music] and all these are possible Oh you may be seated brother branham and the deity of Jesus Christ [Music] second chapter let's read it then it came to pass and in those days that there went out a decree from Caesar Augustus wall the world that they should be taxed and this tax it was first made it by the governor of Serbia and all went to be taxed everyone to his own City and Joseph went also up from Galilee into the city of Nazareth the Judah the City of David which is called Bethlehem because he was of the house and lineage of David to be taxed with Mary mystic spouse wife being great with child and so it was that while they were there the date of her accomplishment that she should be delivered and she brought forth her firstborn son and wrapped him in swaddling clothes and laid him in the manger because there was no room for him in the end now just as a background till we get up to the part of it that I would use this morning now let me just let yourself be in the spirit of the Lord we heard today all over the world as being self celebrated the birth of Jesus which now it's just traditional Jesus was not born on or December the fist or nothing not our December the 25th we know that it's impossible the hills of Judea is full of snow at that time so how could it be that Jesus commonly by astronomers is so forth and by all of us born and first around 1st of April so when in springtime but this is a date which is all right just set aside to worship in Memorial of his coming to the world one of the greatest gifts that God ever give to the world was Jesus Christ that we know then and now I want to speak this morning upon his deity who he's so many hands with a little baby laying out there to cradling so forth but that fact was just one of the pictures just one of the set forth of the drama to bring it after what he really is his deity and he said in the scriptures of his coming he has been since the days of of John plumb back to even into Genesis it was prophesized that the woman's seed would bruise the serpent's head promise in this tribe a child Christ Jesus and he's been that all the prophets most ever probably that was ever wrote in the Bible spoke of his first and second has been when he has come to the world Jesus comes three times he came the first time to redeem his church he comes the second time to receive his church he comes the third time with his church everything in the Bible travels and Trinities trees but all in one crimes he can remember the first time to redeem his church the second time to receive his church the third time with his church as king and queen now but on his first coming will speak off just a little bit and then all his being here and then on his second coming his own it and then on the third time if the Lord willing now in these days there was the great persecution against the church cesar augusto has made a great plans that he attacks all the people and that was only done for one purpose that god's great prophecy would be fulfilled only thing you have to do when you see something in the Bible but it sounds just a little mystic you a little superstitious to you just give God a little bit of time God's nor hers we're the one gets in a hurry just give God just a little bit of time and you'll see the old prophetic wheels cogs run right into the picture Isabella just like a bringing up of a picture like some of us speak the other day said God what would be one of the back of millions and millions of years ago when he was told just like this space here and then he's gathered up into the logos and then he came from the logos down into Christ see it's just God coming down like this to the earth then going right back into God again don't you see what I mean just revolving coming down from space from eternity rolling together coming down into the low cost low cost down into man then returning right back again for one purpose to redeem that man that is fallen now that's what he came far to be our Redeemer and the for God could be a redeemer he had to be according to the law of Tennyson Redeemer he had to be kinfolks to us and God in the beginning made his first man he made him out of spirit and spirit is the invisible part of man that you don't see now if God made man in his own image are you listening all right God made man in his own image and God is a spirit that the Bible and the first man that was made had the government over all the creation just like the Holy Spirit has government over the church today he led the creation he led the animals but there was no man that feel with sorrow so god made man out of the dust of the earth and that man he might have give my hands like a monkey he might give him feet like a bear whatever he did he distorted together it made a man but this man he put this in Mortal spirit that never dived into this manatee become more than a fruit he became a man then this man here that's what I think of atheist and some of the standing around organ but the hours come when got for his life through the hour here they were not doing things that's right and so now when the Oregon while he meets the facts a bear his hands will look like a eight for a monkey or so forth they try to say his RG cup that that has nothing to do it this is the body of planet that he's just living in like a house it's going back to the dusty earth but the Spirit is in Marvel it comes from God that's the image of God God in the spirit that and lost is arching in the Garden of Eden his relationship communion with God was cut off there because of sin and unbelief unbelief is why the Word of God a picture was painted one time to even told her how much brighter would be if she just just discard the Word of God look over here to reason you can't go there's a difference between reason and God's Word God's Word is true reasons Falls you can't reason out nothing that's right our minds not see is not good enough or never will be to fathom God's eternal wisdom and therefore you can't read this you just got to believe until then the picture was painted out back there - our first father and mother and they fell and that broke off relationship with God and was drove for the Garden of Eden from that hour God begins to scream up and down the gardens hunting for his lost child and then the only way that God then could ever redeem him would have to be to make to come down and redeeming himself not in another or not send somebody else he could have sent an angel that would be right but only way God could redeem the man was come down himself and read even if somebody stands here and my Allah the judgment of this this group of people and I had the jurisdiction over you all and if I have someone sinned and I said now opera the groom I want you to pay the prize that would be just if I said my own boy to pay the price that still wouldn't be on the judge the only way that I can be just just for me myself to take his place and what house one pass the judgment and then if I want to redeem the man I've got to take his place myself are you still listen at dollar I want you to notice something thin ones that the only way that God Himself could ever redeem this man was to come down and take his place and that was the hall that was given by Moses of radition that had to be to a kinsman redeemer on man / - was worthy a man who was worth the prize a man then who would make it to public testimony and redeemed the losses think of somebody that had fought and then God was word he came down some 1,900 years ago in the form of a baby born in a manger overshadowed by the Holy Ghost not for my sexual desire he was God to God's blood position the baby is always the blood of its father never of its mother we all know that without I've taught that before your times and you know that the baby has not one speck of its mother's blood in it not a bit no nothing done it's always the blood of the male a hand can lay an egg but if it isn't fertile it'll never hatch no matter how pretty the egg is and how well she warms it it'll always be unfertile early right there and rock that's right unless the male bird has been with the female bird and the germ of life comes from the male therefore when Mary knowing not a man she was with the male God Almighty Jehovah and he overshadowed her and God is the creator that created a blood cell in the womb of Mary no one no man at all and fat brought forth of very creative role of God to redeem us from our life coming in years being born of sexual desire and then that blood was drawn out of Emmanuel's veins on Calvary's cross and today has the same saving redeeming holy power that it did the day the transmission was made out of cow reach agreement hey pal that's right we're redeemed by the blood of God the Bible says we are bought by the blood and redeemed by block God's own blood how was it God's good God has no blood how could it be because it was God's creative blood and he created in order to redeem us and came and lived in the same body that he created therefore he could not Godhead in summer temptation he could suffer temptation he had to suffer sexual temptation he had to suffer all kinds of temptations to be tempted by the devil and riches and powers and the minions and so forth he had to suffer all of that in order to do it he couldn't be his God in spirit he had to be God in flesh I'm speaking this morning on the deity of Christ so it you'll know who he is we're worse not if they did a major not sanicball but we're worshipping Almighty God in the deity of his son and notice then that blood came down analyst was Christ Jesus and God Himself coming out of spirit went into Christ Jesus and the Bible says that God was in Christ reconciling the world to himself in that right God himself Jehovah lived in Christ and was made a kinsman to us because he was born in human flesh like we are that right the blood cells were developed by God and the flesh cells were developed in the womb of Mary the soft worth the child and God came down and lived in human flesh and was tempted in every manner just like we are do you believe that honey all right Wow then when he did that he freely gave his but he didn't have to do it he made that sacrifice he could've went right on up into glory he could have been transfigured like he was on that Transfiguration went all into Hammond and never dies first but to be willing to die for us he gave freely his blood at Calvary that's right and he picked out even the manastar I played with grease and he made a public testimony and those brute Book of Ruth is a very beautiful picture there how this Boaz type of Christ Haledon truth won over a strange country as the backslide one out of the land and brought back with her I mean the old man brought back room and when Ruth came back she was a country boy Evan when she came back she was a moment I absolutely assured the Gentile bride of the church and when she went to leave the OMA and the OMA told her said kiss her told her go back to her people she said I will go with you to your people venture people be my people and let your dwellings be my dwellings that your God be my god and nothing but death shall separate us where you dive dive where you're buried I'll be buried now that is a picture of the Gentile church coming into Christ cause we were once aliens away from God was what the ones the Beast ate but we beat Danny Christ take only for him see that our heirs according to the promise and Christ got a Gentile bride that's exactly right now in order to redeem Boaz to redeem the oldest lost with space after the fact played the State of Israel Ben boy that boy had to come out and when he did a boy has brother and when he came out he had to kick off his shoe before the gates that before the elders to make a public testimony that he had received that lost woman in her estate and in doing that they need fought back also he got in there his bride the woman he is looking for if you had to redeem the woman first in order to get the bride don't you see and that's the same train Christ it he made a public testimony at the gates of Jerusalem when he was beaten smitten depleted and regretted up calories calico Gambas heel and baby they deal with his own blood as a public testimony that he had redeemed all the call of the state from back down her beginning and has redeemed his people from the curse of sin and from the clutches of hell and annoying as she would eat something more in a way states and what she's got I said I'm not beans you comfortless I'll pray the Father he'll give you another comforter which is the Holy Ghost he will a five with you forever I'll go along the world see you people more but I'm going up to him and get this thing sticks up and I'll come back and be with you even eat you until the end of the age that's what I'm talking about is doing everything that's right that's what I was speaking up now is him coming again in his power eighty Jesus float on oh who is he maha this morning to think of some little object of worship some little manger out there some rule that I'm not think of that I'm thinking of Christ the whole authority in our heart supported by the holy golden that's right Oh condemned by the world God has always come into the world when he did the world hated him as it was the days of North so would it be in the coming of the Son of God we're in that dating friend and I notice other while the world sees me no more Jeff you see me for I'll be with you even in it even to the end of the world that's right these year now end of the day nice big picture always rebound up and made the same thing come to pass that we're seeing now the great trauma center and we're ready now to see great things happen the church had been sought from the cradle that's

power has taught me the balance though in God's great drama said year before the Son of God that was in the cradle is in the heart man he's the deity of God he's got the Creator is that all the way he was in the world over the world was made by him and the world knew him not and today that's what's the matter with the church the hope of glory the baptism the Holy Ghost has come into the people's hearts and they don't recognize what a hands they think it's a little Church journey or something like that but that is that godly creator living in you and giving you all the powers and you're in
