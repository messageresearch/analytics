we we know that we're talking about us period in time mementos are most kalamos un período de tiempo that was not too far after the flood right no fuera temple this was the loop so we just we kind of have our minds where where we're at in time the neural element is multi don't estamos aqui en and right here camisa is where I found the first reference in the Bible to an earthly king but they went through yo la première reference en la biblia to read note this is the first place that I was able to find out somebody else's found something else please let me know is the primer lugar or SLBMs encontrado mazda he may serve it but we like to do with this with this king nimrod no kakera with hacer con esta la meme groans oh we want to pull out a few a few characteristics of this earthly king Guillermo's Saqqara gunas characteristic as this the later another because in understanding what happened yesterday for Canton en de lo que paso a year we can understand how the modern powers of today work cono sur meuse entonces como las puertas manos del mundo there there are a lot of complicated situations in the world right now I'm Moochi toastiness complication and mundo you not gonna sit here and try and name all of them off you know almost part of Mattala sake but there's a lot of complications in this world right which is complete cuz you only say that mundo aura and and let me let me tell you in learning what I've learned here in apprehended okay a are indeed wucky it's the kings of the earth that are behind all these compasses no religious de la tía reqest and they trusted to us is does complete error and things that we cannot see I kosis que no puede mas very and are working in ways that we don't understand they start our hunger it over us you know and to them and this is the state this is Satan's world right now yes the SL mundo the Saturn and he has kings in his domain right now right yes it's Superman these Kings are the ones that are calling the shots yes - gracious Winooski money huh so if you see problems with sickness you still very preliminary there's a king behind that I already see problems with the economy the way problema cell economy there's a king behind now you read the tradition if you see problems with politics our problem is completely there is a king behind now you can write that rather isto so just so we know that this is what we're trying to understand most and there is not much but no no matter how complicated through Singapore target and complicado the political and ecclesiastical in the economic situations are no serious political ecclesiasticus the economic us just know that they had their beginning so lost efficacious to Vieira super cheap they're gonna have their end even at their soup in so let's not get interrupted tonight don't know entosis assembles into room pillows don't let these things that are happening in the world move you know the heck is to keep us on El Mundo loss waiver let's learn tonight to move by one thing double some awareness estado chip or lucky and let that be that one thing be God's Word in our life hasta la palabra de Dios de nuestras vidas Christ is the word Cristo so we can learn tonight to just see that simple song on Christ the solid rock I most of it is not you it is akin to crystal a solid abraca all the other Kings are sinking sand all ages is is a dynamo Vidisha the kings of the earth will interrupt you los race is not yet of an interim peers they'll disrupt you it just wanna perturb are they'll take your peace vana catarrhalis to pass but God's Word anchors you tonight pero la palabra use long clothes and no matter what the winds bring is in important ok Trigon lesbian to if you're anchored on Christ the solid rock just rest on clothing crystal La Roca solely that we cannot be moved no podemos there more vidoes so this is really simple tonight it's just simply in esta noche we we heard a couple weeks ago from our pastor couch almost as soon as a man attend mr. pahst well that way when we get out from behind God's Word cuando los alamos that they trust de la palabra it makes you subject to a king of the earth Rochester une soupe de todos los zetas hombre de la tierra you remember when he was describing the tribes shock work on to describe a distribution and the directions in the section is the north a sewer is the UST and how that the king of the north would come in compadre del Norte of Andrea that happens when we get out from behind God a pastor cuando los alamos desde la palabra we do that it makes a subject to one of those kings cuando se Moses Moses a soup Tito's I will notice or radius so let's just dig in a little bit here and see in trauma some polka mas learn where these kings started removed on the end Basara nestorius first of all let's see we went over who Nimrod was America the most Canadian growth he was again he was the son of cush evil couche he was who was the son of ham before ham who was the son of Noah evil annoy we read that Nimrods approach to land vamoose que el el acercamiento Nimrod a tiara if you go back in you read in that chapter that we just read in Genesis you still violated capitalist easily you'll find that that Shem and Japheth vamoose Kissimmee have faith they're up their jurisdiction on the land that they were given Lovegood is extremely la tierra Casillas deal are completely different so complete them into different Shem and Japheth divided the lands amongst their heirs Sami have a DVD arrows to Tierra interrelated arrows but the Bible describes Nimrods portion but is a la Vida at this critical apportioned an inroad as his kingdom let the spirit como su Raymond I want you to keep that characteristic in your mind did okay thing as a characteristic consume and division of Nimrods portion que la división de la poor silk didn't road it's a it it's a kingdom as soon right now there was nobody else but him Navi are not Eva's see no in his approach was they're coming to us ultimate control it il control total he controlled his kingdom l Kodava Ultima meant a total rain I ask you tonight who's controlling your king la pregunta king coat or lazuli no let me warn you they met but fearless if you have yourself in the driver's seat in your kingdom to se tiene incandescent case then lassie I am the control it's already know then you're no different than Nimrod tonight it does so no different they can even growth if in your life you put yourself in the number one place your to veto stead es el que se pone en la ctrl conductor ole ole numero uno in su vida you are no different than Nimrod whose turn was different they can improve so that's it that's one of his characteristics was characteristic us he was a king Aaron Ray he had complete control in the human control total in pseudo mean you next the Bible describes him as a mighty one in the earth mr. loving love the spirit composure roses over la tierra he was known as a mighty hunter before the Lord tarakudo Co como el Grande castle or delante de hvar so we know that he was mighty sorry almost-kiss poderoso how contrary that is to God's waiting and control us to is a la manera de Dios because you because God said that is not by might nor by power the second is poor poor little poor force' but it is by my spirit is what is for me as pity to distil Senor so I want you to keep that in your mind to you're getting an instrumental another characteristic to remember otra characteristically recordar Nimrod was mighty desk Nimrod era poderoso I like what brother brother Han said today about the guitar me gustan lo que hermano lan de la guitarra is it all your and you don't even know how to play with what good are you oh so no sorry I don't care keep the camera steady already proved it today it's not by might nor by bow or you can risk now but I don't work what talent or portal in not buy some gift that you're giving up Aroon don't kiss aell as though but it's by his Spirit we heard various boring speech to scooch up Moses rest on mañana but Nimrod was mighty but embroider uphold it also and the third thing we wanted what wanted hit on the certificate hemos hablado is how did Nimrods kingdom start come on crystal already know the numeral I already start what was the beginning of how the kingdom started qualified police EPO commonplace oyster rain known as one Camus know as one people como port long as one language to Munna lingua everybody said the same thing all those this yellow mist and why did the people want out of this he kick at the yellow hint to this in this condition where they are all one it is the condition of the toes that I wonder are they seeking caboose come on a juice protection protection that's what they wanted is really that's what they want if in the Lea I look at Aryan protection protection from what protection the King from God's wrath de la da de Deus somehow del goundamani in just a few short generations illness Curtis handed us your needful and lost the knowledge of God la gente a perdido el conocimiento that yours they forgot that their great-grandfather's it was little because who taught our awareness found grace in the eyes of yellow was a guy that's the way that was provided to them in Manila Provost alright he's God's wrath para comer lighting of the blood it generates go to hell askew and they forgot about the listings II though there's courses they had forgotten so this will be though but there was a promise that God had made a promise that could you serve yet made our covenant yourself eh to with their great-grandfather on to third on a willow that I would not destroy the yellow then welcome you make that covenant with the earth he saw is that boxes I won't do that no more can do us that more than where won't they forgot were there vasillis olvido de esta su protección Nimrod Nimrod was a great-grandson of Noah era own be titania told annoying and yet in just three generations interest in it as soon as Nimrods Kingdom had forgotten they know the name growth tellus will be low-key nasarah where do we stand tonight de las palmas histologically forgotten who you are sailor balakian is stone you know when we have to hear whether tenemos chris cuchara people don't want to come to church no gala - located near a legalist yeah it is so sad it's done in Christa see it's not be let me say this they're missing not because the leaves are dry no porque las lajas mistake that's the problem is not that the leaves will blow away this colossal husqvarna wall double ah este problema problem is when we don't want to come to church bro lemma is key no caramel vanilla glaze those things it'll be us and also importantly me for failing to know what God's Word says about those things and also be honest us kostas it's a sad thing that's gonna close up three how we can have a little virus monster don't even see you no podemos it makes us run you know something I wanna change become aware God's program words look at those changes program your Cutlass to programa he's never into the ages wait yeah parados su camino three generations they forgot who they were senators unison us will be low-key never forget who you are tonight don't be the kid who has been bought by a great price that's real compromise blood sacrifice torment that has been made with unity was wounded for our trance they rose from my enemies as enticement of our partner mister smoker and what has dried for so you were heals tough wait yeah Sano that's the God that we serve that and I abuse because the bounty of the rate of the kings nothing mere though the low radius maybe they were relying on their own understand the protostar on edges representing soup rotten repeated men2 of what caused the flood of cacao so LD love you maybe it studied the terror of the floods effects the protests we are on El Faro throws efectos they love you and they saw how much they had lost TV rockets on Toby on parties but somehow they'll grow monitor they lost the knowledge of God's promise with no perdieron acontecimiento the professor the authorized annoying so they wanted some assurance Gideon I just would not stay GUI that people want insurance tonight I think the killer's to tell you the best assurance that you can have hosting duties are to stop assurance Jesus is mine nothing without his oh what a foretaste of glory divine with the least of these I'm an heir of salvation purchase of God it's real compromise I've been washed in his spirit and washed in his blood he's still of others who spirit we love others but the people they wanted protection but I hint the heretics unit they wanted some assurance he do not agree that that they would be protected if the flood ever happened again they want to separate the hero sea water has been yonder love you people wanted protection la gente que de protección but they forgot what their protection was perros de la sala de la raza protection so right here in Genesis sake and Hennessy we find the pattern and could Ramos one patron let me tell you tonight because none of those earthly kings will want you to think another way aesthetic appearance and go Terminator but right here in Genesis we find the pattern but a few tendencies in control that all the earthly kingdoms will be established patron por todos ray knows their analysis even I said for Molly it boils down to the fact eva ha estado yeah people would give up their inherent illa history and triggers to Orencia in exchange for protection cameo for protects young people are willing to trade their freedom and grace lifestyle is placed at camp used to live at liberty to crusty trade the promises of God has promised us that the old trade their in their inheritance it's obvious to Orencia in exchange for a little bit of protection Kapila for Paquito protection as it's a little uncomfortable tonight maybe the protein como esta noche but this is the pattern you'll see that falls all down to time Mahalo Tim and it starts with getting who you are MPs are could be done to stay here instead down to history a tremendous story I know you'll find that even where God describes that he hates the deeds of the Nicolaitans this went on to do see way a woman's gonna kill all the a loss loss ETSU the loss Nicolaitans why because they exchanged or cages come here on God's word for deeds la palabra de Dios or Oprah's so again Nimrods kingdom was set up to this already know the nimrod h o by taking of the people's land tomando de la tierra de la gente establishing his power established en dos super there and get making the people have a desire to be protected yes yellow que la gente to hear on the sale this airport and this is what starts all the kingdom is new york appears a todos lados

historian or don't know so you need to do Lord but I did penal even one time [Laughter] bear with me here to this to put them in a Travis days to pay attention because this is very important what we have here important to look at the name was a key earthly kingdoms in history Lorenzo star analyst la storia that domains that fell under the rulership of the kings los Domingos kekova herald behold o Guillermo del Oro they were divided into three classes why don't the videos interest classes I mean then a fourth one came later and we'll talk about that one what am i started I'm Jose assume that the classes they they were basically las clases básicamente those who would fight in Arles carefully I want those who would pray Oscar Allen and those who would work you know Scott Rama Harlan those were the three classes under the Kings classes bahala radius those who fight are known as the nobles lost capella on second ocean come all those noblest those who pray are known as the priesthood loss Quran is common sense of loss or the church's organizational a sort of Gotti's as soon as the lay Glacia these are those who those these are the two great powers of the system as long as those perez

these are the kingdoms it's a perversion of what God's clearest Oh soon religious kids on purpose to look it the only way you could get into these two classes lonely come Manila and throat in his classes was to be born into them Nasir enlisted in a start classes Oceania there was no upward mobility no a via money revealed you couldn't be a UH you couldn't be a worker one day and a priest the next day the players didn't over arrow di other goat a lot earlier the nobles and the church was no less than legally owned and controlled all the land it all supposed to order see closely control on la tierra the church leaders were the nobles lost literally listed almost no the reason was because las he would only have one heir to the throne this que la sala tenía una torero altro no because there was there could not be any dividing of the kingdom porque no for the upper division at el rey know he couldn't divide it amongst multiple layers no local deity we didn't there muchos there was only one heir okay I was alone at all because the kingdom would be weakened porque el rey nostaria devil doing a division with weak in the King can do not even the military El Reno but being in the church Pharaoh stumble eaglets was still a pretty good profession I don't know where not profess you know because you could still live a lavish life to set me up with your area una vida mood mood Rica

your needle iglesia oh my my church we don't want to be that he's lookin ok demos that you don't come from being of the royal seat of a birdie the last elementary algebra so be going down and sitting in a church pew but us intercessor Luna Lanka now you're just a little Church memory solstice on the way God King denominated El Reno the Jews but that's the way it work there pero Sierra yeah these two classes controlled those classes control oven polo the noble in the church classes those novelist a lackluster they glisten are those that would fight all escaped le oven and those that would pray los gayo Robin they were supported by the rest of society Rosso por todos por el resto de la sociedad equivalent to about 90% of the kingdom here are equivalent a como la venta poor siento del Rey no was was supporting the upper 10% support Amin al LDS por ciento Kerala class al this 90% is dead no interpreting of the people who worked era and unloose over arrows so we're gonna get into the working class almost a classic Turkey but we'll inject this right here mimosa Methodist oke another class rose up in in that system otra classes 11 Tennessee sistema that became known as the merchant class kid you got on a sarcoma lose America ladies the merchant class were the businessmen like let's say the Mercator said all those hombres amazing you how to make money Savion como hacer dinero how
