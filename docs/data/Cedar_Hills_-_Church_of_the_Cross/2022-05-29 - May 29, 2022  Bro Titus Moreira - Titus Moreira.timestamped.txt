[39:23] thomas junior uh my brother william
[39:52] on our lord jesus christ
[40:25] to give you a little bit of context
[40:30] happening
[40:34] a little after daniel just
[41:03] is
[41:18] some of them were ready
[41:20] to return
[41:23] regarding the prophecy
[41:27] or according to the prophecy
[41:32] that jeremiah
[42:04] now these are the children of the
[42:05] province that went up out of out of the
[42:08] captivity of those which had been
[42:09] carried away whom nebuchadnezzar the
[42:11] king of babylon had carried away unto
[42:13] babylon and came again unto jerusalem
[42:16] and judah everyone unto his city
[42:20] we'll be speaking
[42:22] with our
[42:24] theme
[42:25] starting again
[42:27] let us pray
[42:28] father
[42:52] [Music]
[43:24] in the name of jesus christ
[43:26] amen
[43:38] is
[44:33] in our lives
[44:48] this is
[45:02] god is not
[45:16] many
[45:31] a very difficult time in their lives
[45:35] the first temple they built
[45:38] was the temple of solomon
[45:40] have been destroyed
[45:42] in jeremiah's time
[46:12] and he
[47:37] time
[47:42] in babylon
[47:48] they have the vision but vietnam refuse
[49:15] of darius
[49:19] understood by books
[49:25] where the word of the lord came to
[49:27] jeremiah the prophet
[49:56] daniel was around 68 years old in
[49:58] babylon he was he had been 68 years
[50:00] ago
[50:04] he spent 68 years in babylon
[50:08] the 70 years weren't fulfilled yet
[51:18] they can prepare
[52:28] two years later
[52:31] [Applause]
[52:44] is casino
[52:46] we don't fast
[52:47] for me i say for myself
[52:49] i know that there's some warriors of
[52:51] fasting in here
[52:55] but when we see daniel fast
[52:58] that lets me
[53:11] that's what fasting is about
[53:53] of this earth
[53:54] [Music]
[54:22] confusion who was first
[54:27] movement
[54:33] and now we come to ezra chapter two
[54:36] el
[55:59] for the first time
[56:28] you
[57:37] right
[57:50] but it's more difficult
[57:54] to be excited
[58:04] we speak about restoration
[58:10] the definition of the word lets us know
[58:12] that can be an avedo daniels that there
[58:14] are damages
[58:20] restoration
[58:49] things that didn't come out the way you
[58:51] wanted them to and
[58:54] then it's more difficult
[58:59] to be excited over a restoration
[59:16] there
[59:44] there are memories
[59:47] that state of what happened
[59:52] so when i read ezra chapter two
[59:56] esto son lo sijos de la provincia these
[1:00:00] are the children of the province estos
[1:00:03] de la province these are the children of
[1:00:05] the province
[1:00:07] i went up out of captivity the chaos
[1:00:14] of those which had been carried away
[1:00:16] whom nebuchadnezzar the king of babylon
[1:00:17] had carried away unto babylon
[1:00:20] and came again unto jerusalem
[1:00:23] and judah
[1:00:25] everyone unto his city
[1:01:20] that god can still do it
[1:01:36] the temple restaurant
[1:01:39] restore the city
[1:01:43] travel almost 1 000
[1:01:46] months of walking
[1:01:50] there were about 50 thousand los que
[1:01:52] salero the ones that left
[1:01:55] it was a very small number
[1:01:59] compared to all them that stayed in
[1:02:00] babylon
[1:02:03] a very small number
[1:02:18] or
[1:02:33] smashing kids on the walls
[1:02:36] they were raping women
[1:02:40] they were taking the people of israel
[1:02:41] captive
[1:02:43] it was horrible
[1:02:46] and some
[1:03:14] left for you
[1:03:18] that's why you are here
[1:03:22] there may be neurotics
[1:03:26] where you can't even get your mind
[1:03:27] together
[1:04:24] is
[1:04:38] maybe
[1:05:06] children
[1:05:20] oh
[1:05:33] i am proud
[1:06:29] all of them
[1:06:32] [Applause]
[1:07:11] it's hard to make people excited
[1:07:15] the expectations are very low so
[1:07:18] very low
[1:09:18] it's
[1:09:55] i'm not as good as people think i am but
[1:09:58] i'm not also as bad as people think i am
[1:10:28] feel good about
[1:10:41] what about me
[1:11:51] many times we complain
[1:12:06] is
[1:12:19] it was only a crib
[1:12:22] that old temple
[1:12:25] was just a cradle
[1:12:28] what job chapter 8 says
[1:12:32] verse 7
[1:12:34] job 8
[1:12:46] should greatly increase
[1:13:02] come on
[1:13:16] to stay as a child
[1:13:43] [Applause]
[1:13:58] is
[1:14:13] need of milk inode elementos and not of
[1:14:16] strong meats
[1:14:23] for everyone that uses milk is
[1:14:25] unskillful in the word of righteousness
[1:14:27] for he is a babe
[1:14:29] though but strong meat especially
[1:14:33] belongs to them that are of full age
[1:14:38] even those who by reason of the youths
[1:14:41] have their senses exercised
[1:14:49] notice what it's saying
[1:14:51] if you're going to be great
[1:14:54] if you're going to grow
[1:16:32] who knows
[1:16:44] be the predator
[1:16:49] [Applause]
[1:17:00] devils
[1:17:23] [Applause]
[1:17:28] he wants
[1:17:41] limiting you
[1:17:43] [Applause]
[1:17:56] seem great
[1:18:04] let me tell you
[1:18:07] it was too small
[1:18:37] oh
[1:19:05] a greater plan for your life
[1:19:19] more beautiful
[1:20:15] israel and the church
[1:20:19] oh they believe in theology
[1:20:30] you can't speak
[1:20:42] [Music]
[1:21:01] something that's hung along and had a
[1:21:03] lot of this embalming fluid
[1:21:06] do you realize
[1:21:32] [Music]
[1:21:40] been
[1:22:35] [Music]
[1:23:18] use us
[1:23:46] nothing
[1:24:00] bless
[1:24:03] [Music]
[1:24:29] religion with religion
[1:24:35] says that seminaries are cemeteries
[1:24:40] many times the devil has us bound with
[1:24:42] religious
[1:24:54] break the chains that had him
[1:25:24] oh
[1:25:31] to be free
[1:26:03] we can imagine
[1:26:26] the church pentecost today stands i
[1:26:27] believe three years ago the sunday
[1:26:29] visitor of the catholic church said that
[1:26:31] they had a million conversions to
[1:26:33] catholicism in one year but
[1:26:38] but the pentecostal church had one
[1:26:40] million five hundred thousand more than
[1:26:41] that
[1:26:43] but what have you got
[1:26:46] when you got it
[1:26:48] in other words
[1:27:26] the church today is not willing to pay
[1:27:27] the price
[1:27:43] it demolishes things around us
[1:27:46] when he shakes
[1:27:48] zumba
[1:27:49] he almost brings us down and i don't
[1:27:51] know what i'm speaking
[1:27:53] i can be one person
[1:27:54] maybe someone watches
[1:27:57] in that condition
[1:28:11] could ever imagine
[1:28:25] they realize
[1:28:39] depends on what is left
[1:28:54] what is
[1:29:08] if
[1:29:50] more than
[1:30:04] beautiful
[1:30:09] [Applause]
[1:30:17] not many men of god left
[1:30:32] the way
[1:30:53] [Applause]
[1:30:57] is
[1:30:58] [Applause]
[1:31:13] is
[1:31:25] [Music]
[1:31:54] god is still here
[1:32:09] oh
