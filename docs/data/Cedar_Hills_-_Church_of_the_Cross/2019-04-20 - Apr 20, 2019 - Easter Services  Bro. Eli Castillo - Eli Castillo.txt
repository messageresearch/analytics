minutes from now I'll be in it that's him that really him I saw that same person as a will in the middle of the will turning way up in the middle of the air I saw him coming with ten thousands of his Saints to execute judgment [Applause] but is that my brethren I am the one that you think I am uh and the seed of the woman I dated I am the son of God I am the Virgin porn one not blood as a tone

the moon and stars the i-word the Morning Sun the Savior was far his body on the cross his blood poured out the weight of every curse upon [Music] I know breath he gave as heaven looked away the Son of God was laid in da a battle in the war on death was waged the power of Hell forever broken the ground began to shake the stone was rolled away his perfect love could not be now death where is your sting Oh [Music] [Applause] the ground being to say is perfect [Music] [Applause] [Music] there are words you see my brain has not yet reached a point where the former thought I could adequately describe the greatness of my god and my lungs have not yet developed the ability to breathe with enough agility to breathe out the greatness of this boat in my voice you see my voice so inhibited restrained by human limits that it's hard even send a person you see if their words [Music] his praises remarkable mercies are strength is impenetrable he is honorable accountable favorable he's unsearchable yet knowable indefinable yet approachable indescribable yet person he is beyond comprehension further than imagination concept in generations king of every nation but if their words for him you see my words are fuel and trying to capture the one true God using my vocabulary would never do but I use words as an expression an expression of worship to a savior a savior who was both worthy and deserving of my praise so I use words my heart expose the Lord blesses his name forever he has won my heart captured my mind and bound them both together he has defeated me in my rebellion conquered me and my sin he is welcomed me into his presence and completely invited me in he has made himself the object of my sight flooding me with mercies in the morning and drowning me with grace in the night but if there are words I don't have them for my god but what I do have is good news for my God knew that man-made words would never do these words are just tools tools that we use to express the one true God so he said his son Jesus Christ as the word living proof he is the image of the invisible God the firstborn of all creation for by him all things were created giving nothingness formation and by his word he sustains in the power of his name for he's before all things and above all things he reigns so praised him for his life [Music] the way he persevered in strife the humble son of God becoming the perfect sacrifice praising for his death [Music] that he willingly stood in our place that he lovingly endured the grave that he battled our enemy and on the third day a rose in victory he is everything that is promised praise him as the risen King lift your voice and sing for one day one day he will return for us to dwell with him for eternity for eternity so it's not just words that I proclaim for my words point to be word and the word has a name hope president joy has been this has a name love has a name and that name is Jesus Christ praise His name forever [Applause] [Music] weezing hi weezing hello lamb is overcome wheezing we see hi the name is over [Music] now [Music] [Applause] [Music] Jesus [Music] and he's still calling calling mr. Dory are you ready [Music] [Music] the day [Music] [Music] the day Rick taught me [Music] okay they talk make you laugh Oh [Music] Oh we call as divided tonight [Applause] Oh Oh God [Applause] toby is

no repentance so we come today to baptize we understand that baptism does not it does not give us the new birth we don't believe that we believe that baptism is simply an outer expression of something
