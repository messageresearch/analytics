========================================

now the fifth seal begins the sixth chapter of revelations the ninth verse and when he had opened the fifth seal i saw under the altar the souls of them that were slain for the word of god and for the testimony which they held and they cried with a loud voice saying how long oh lord holy and true does not judge and avenge our blood on them that dwell on the earth and white robes were given un unto every one of them and it was said unto them that they should rest yet for a little season until their fellow servants also their brethren that should be killed as they were should be fulfilled notice there is no mention of another beast or a living living creature to this announcement of the fifth seal we know that see there's no living creature notice but here when we come to this fifth seal now there's there's there's no rider goes forth and there's no beast to announce it that is that the mystery of the church ages are already finished at this time the mystery of the antichrist is revealed at this time the antichrist took his last ride and we found him on this pale horse mixed with these many colors and rides all the way into perditions right there they're waving the church age the church absolutely is raptured at this time the church goes up in the fourth chapter of revelations and does not return till it comes back with this king in the 19th chapter but these seals here are revealing what has been what is and what will be notice when the antichrist or them them revelations in the presence of that ball of fire hanging there in a room oh brother although i've seen since a child every time it comes near me it alarms it he almost puts in an unconscious condition you never get used to it you can it's too sacred now notice not on the ninth verse souls under the altar now here's where i'm gonna get some real [Music] disagrees but i just watched just a minute yes see i thought that too but it didn't come that way we've i've always thought that these souls under the altar were the the the martyrs of the early church and i'm sure that well dr us smith and everyone says it is see but i thought so myself but when the holy spirit showed the vision to it it wasn't that isn't the soul now who are these souls that's the next thing who are they that if they're not the early church this is israel that's to be saved as a nation all them that are predestinated that's israel that's israel itself for i would not brethren that you should be ignorant of the mystery thus you should be wise in your own conceit the blindness in part is happened to israel until the fulfilling fullness of the gentiles become in as it is written that shall come out of zion are delivered and shall turn away ungodliness for jacob what israel was blinded for the very purpose of us being saved notice now i want you to watch this real close they were given robes they didn't have they were given robes white robes each one of them now the saints now have already have one they get it here [Music] but there they were giving robes and the saints already had theirs and gone on see see they had had not the these souls understanding now that's under the altar why they were martyred by sinful man like eichmann see they're holding right on millions of them but they remain jews now remember what wasn't they were killed for the word of god sake not for the testimony of christ did you understand that but remember the church come in also the martyrs of the church was for the word of god and the testimony of jesus christ i mean it was that your truth all right now but these didn't have the testimony of jesus christ for the word of god and for the testimony which they helped the jews and hitler hated them so did i started stalling all the rest of the world but they stayed true to what they believed and they killed them because they were jews that's right and for their testimony they helped they were martyred and here was souls under the altar after the church had been gone now what they had in their blindness martyred their messiah and now they were reaping for it they realized that they recognized it has gone on they've seen them when they come before they alter god but now watch the grace of god comes to them and jesus gives them each one a white robe watch pull over after the church is gone like joseph did to his brethren a tithe look when joseph stood there and when he finally made himself going there for the altar [Music] and he said to him he said don't you know me oh hey he's speaking hebrew now i'm your brother joseph oh my they said nah oh you're going to get so wait a minute wait a minute god did that for a purpose had you to throw me out in order to save life [Applause] [Music] don't be angry with yourselves remember joseph said that which is a type of 144 thousands we'll get later what he did he just run right quick the benjamin fell on his neck started hugging his little brother that had been born into the family after he had been gone by his mother the first church the orthodox church the 144 thousand were born in his absence while he's awake and get his gentile bride so you see who they are these jews 144 000 is to be called out by the two witnesses of revelation 11. now remember there was to prophesy notice these souls are to wait a little season for the 144 to be martyred oh isn't that isn't that just puts the bible together well listen i just got something to tell you it's just so good it's just burning right in my heart i hope you haven't forgotten [Music] let me say this in the presence of him by his grace he also let me see my people not long ago and white ruins remember you remember the story not long ago the gentile bride they're there now they're always in white robes notice this now now if there's no altar of sacrifice in heaven where is the sacrifice for sin land the land there has to be a place where that slaying lamb bloody is laying there or the blood or i do think brother by the opening of this fifth seal as i believe that it's open to us i did it with good conscience with clear revelation before god not trying to just make it think because i always was against the organization never would belong to him but it's open to me now
