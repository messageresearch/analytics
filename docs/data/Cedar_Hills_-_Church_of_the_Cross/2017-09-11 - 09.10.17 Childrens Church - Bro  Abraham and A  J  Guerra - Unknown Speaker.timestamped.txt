[12:24] I'd like to share something with you
[12:26] that's been on my heart and it's very
[12:29] personal to me who loves the story of
[12:40] Samson well you know how you know how
[12:51] the Philistines captured Samson and
[12:54] shaved all his hair off and he lost all
[12:56] his strength same thing with my papa
[13:00] except they didn't shave all his hair
[13:03] off he fell the doctor said he'll never
[13:26] be able to walk again and he's been
[13:31] telling me do you scratch his nose for
[13:34] him but now he could lift up his arm and
[13:44] scratches no man knows his himself and
[13:52] he could also sit up on his chair and he
[13:58] could walk a little bit with help and I
[14:04] know that that was God
[14:08] [Applause]
[14:12] and the same with Samson while he was in
[14:16] prison he his hair started going back
[14:23] and he got all his strength back and I
[14:29] know that this God of Samson is the same
[14:33] god of today god bless you
[14:48] Wow
[14:50] you believe that that the same God of
[14:54] Samson is the same God here tonight now
[14:59] I got something to tell you I don't know
[15:02] about you young people you young kids
[15:04] here but I was outside earlier and I
[15:08] walked inside and I saw this man it
[15:15] looks kind of kind of funny at first I
[15:17] didn't know who he was and then I said
[15:20] hey brother who are you and he goes I
[15:22] come from the land of the Philistines
[15:24] and I come here to encourage my young
[15:29] ladies and I come here to encourage the
[15:32] young men tonight I said really
[15:35] well who are you and I maybe maybe
[15:39] longer brothers can go help him I think
[15:41] he was over there trying to tie up a a
[15:43] lion or something like that yeah there
[15:46] was a lion outside a church can you
[15:48] believe that you you don't believe me
[15:51] you're looking at me like there's no way
[15:53] bro no there was a lion outside of
[15:57] church and this guy was out there and he
[16:01] ripped his lion apart with his bare
[16:04] hands because he said nothing's gonna
[16:08] happen to my little children that are
[16:10] here tonight so I'm gonna ask Samson to
[16:14] come up and tell you a little bit
[16:16] himself so maybe maybe it'll help you

[17:10] that there but anything happens I'm
[17:14] ready to get down god bless each and
[17:19] every one of you all you children you
[17:22] guys happy today well from the land of
[17:28] the Philistines there was a man who came
[17:32] his name was Samson he was a judge he's
[17:36] one of the judges he judged for 20 years
[17:38] over the Israelites and he was he was a
[17:44] mighty man of God
[17:45] I rest up as Samson but I'm gonna tell
[17:49] you the story of Samson okay I'm gonna
[17:52] tell you the story because it's a it's a
[17:54] it Samson was a man who he showed and he
[17:59] proved all that God was all the power
[18:02] that God said he had Samson when he was
[18:07] here on earth when he was walking he
[18:10] proved that God was everything he said
[18:13] he was so I'm gonna tell you a little
[18:16] story today see Samson in that you
[18:21] remember you remember the children of
[18:22] Israel in the time time of Moses right
[18:24] and during those times they had the
[18:29] Israelites were we're in the desert for
[18:31] 40 years you guys remember that your
[18:34] Sunday School teachers they teach you
[18:36] that
[18:36] right well in those times it was the
[18:41] same thing when when Samson came okay
[18:44] when Samson came the children were
[18:47] delivered into the hands of the
[18:49] Philistines okay for 40 years and that
[18:51] was during the time the Samson came on
[18:54] the scene okay and the beginning of the
[18:58] story it talks about the angel of the
[19:02] Lord visiting Samson's mom so when when
[19:07] the angel the Lord came to Samson's mom
[19:09] he said he said you're going to have a
[19:12] son sound familiar
[19:14] you guys know the story he says you're
[19:19] going to have a son and and he's going
[19:23] to and he's going he's going to be the
[19:29] deliverer of Israel he's going to
[19:32] deliver Israel but he's going to be a
[19:34] Nazarite from Earth okay so you find we
[19:40] see that that he had to come through the
[19:43] vow of the Nazarite you guys know what
[19:46] the valve and Nazarite was the the valve
[19:49] the Nazarite well you he was you
[19:53] couldn't drink no wine or no strong
[19:56] drink of course you guys don't do that
[20:01] right and they they were not supposed to
[20:07] cut their hair what I mean they were not
[20:11] to cut their hair they were not to eat
[20:14] no unclean food but as important as all
[20:21] those three words the vow of a Nazirite
[20:24] it was a special calling it was
[20:29] something special that you would devote
[20:32] your life to get closer to God and we
[20:36] can we can do the we can take the
[20:39] Nazareth the velvet as right right who
[20:43] wants to get closer to God tonight who's
[20:46] who's come here to get closer to God
[20:48] man we want to get closer to God right
[20:52] that was the vow of a Nazarite to get
[20:56] closer to God so we see that that they
[21:03] didn't want to take no pleasure that
[21:06] this was the bow that the angel gave to
[21:09] Samson's mom it wasn't just for Samson
[21:11] the mom she had to take the vow to okay
[21:15] until Samson would come til that
[21:18] blessing would come she had to take the
[21:20] same bow so she had she took the bow of
[21:24] the nazaré as well you know and as she
[21:29] did you know that's the whole thing is
[21:32] that you have to put everything in this
[21:36] world to the side all things that that
[21:39] that this world any desires you have
[21:41] this one they put it to the side like
[21:43] you know how you guys like to play the
[21:46] Xbox no that's the wrong crowd right no
[21:51] Xbox lovers okay there's an honest he's
[21:58] up he's being honest well see all of
[22:01] those things he would put when Samson
[22:03] came he put all of those things to the
[22:05] side and his whole goal was to get
[22:08] closer to God that was his main goal in
[22:12] his life he would he would submit
[22:16] himself to God in every way that's what
[22:21] he did so as Samson began to get older
[22:25] like a young man he uh he started to
[22:30] look upon girls and on now you guys
[22:40] right so as he began to find he liked
[22:48] young lady he told his father go down to
[22:53] that land and bring me about a bride he
[22:59] had a particular woman that he liked
[23:02] so his father says well you can't marry
[23:04] our own people of our own people you
[23:08] can't take a bride of our own he says no
[23:11] I want that one so he had one in
[23:13] particular she's a Philistine so here
[23:17] goes his his dad down to Tim now you
[23:22] know and when he goes down to Timna he
[23:25] sees a woman in Timnath the daughters of
[23:27] the Philistines and on his way there
[23:30] though
[23:31] had some trouble outside on his way
[23:35] there he goes through the vineyard of
[23:39] Timna okay and as he's going through
[23:42] there he slayed a lion goes and tries to
[23:46] attack him man believe that this life
[23:49] just comes out of nowhere tries to bite
[23:51] him for no reason so what does he do he
[23:53] part you believe that there's bare hands
[24:01] he rips him to pieces so the goal and
[24:04] they get the girl they come back and as
[24:06] he's coming back he remembers oh shoot
[24:08] I killed the lion over there go check it
[24:11] out we hunters we do that right no we
[24:16] don't do that right so all right so he
[24:25] goes inside of that inside of that lion
[24:29] there was low and behold bees made this
[24:33] hive inside of there and brother branham
[24:36] our prophet he says that was the
[24:39] sweetest honey
[24:41] Samson ever eaten in his whole life was
[24:45] that honey sense he was I could just see
[24:48] him right now just eating it so that
[24:50] sounds pretty good right now
[24:51] some honey hmm so he takes that honey
[24:56] and goes I'm gonna give some to take
[24:57] some to my mom and dad so he goes in
[25:00] there there there so then you know he
[25:04] has his bride there and they say well
[25:05] let's throw a bash let's throw a big old
[25:09] party how many of you guys like parties
[25:12] he liked the party Tommy loves
[25:15] loves to party this guy is a party
[25:18] animal yes he is
[25:20] I'm coming to find that out see cuz look
[25:24] so they throw this big ol party they
[25:27] invite you know thirty companions the
[25:29] Bible tells us and these companions they
[25:32] were of the land of the Philistines -
[25:35] Sol Sampson got kind of close to him and
[25:38] he was really good friends with one of
[25:39] them and as he gets there he says I have
[25:43] an idea
[25:44] I'm gonna give him a riddle and let me
[25:46] see if they can't figure out this riddle
[25:49] so he starts to tell the riddle and
[25:53] nobody could figure it out here we're on
[25:56] day six they had seven days to figure
[26:00] out the riddle
[26:01] so like Philistines are cowards they go
[26:08] and they tell the wife you you need to
[26:12] tell us what the riddle is if not we're
[26:16] gonna kill you we're gonna kill you
[26:18] we're gonna kill your father and we're
[26:19] gonna put you both in the house and burn
[26:21] it so you better tell us or you're gonna
[26:23] die so she goes and you know Samson
[26:29] please sweetheart
[26:32] would you tell me what the riddle is and
[26:35] here's Samson he trusts her believed
[26:39] that she loved him and cows that tells
[26:42] the riddle so they go and they tell
[26:45] Samson the riddle Samson knew there's no
[26:48] way he they could have figured the real
[26:51] out there's no way sorry guys and so
[26:58] anyways they figured out the riddle he
[27:02] is so upset with her that he just takes
[27:04] off he was so mad his father knew how
[27:07] mad he was he got so mad that he went he
[27:14] went to Ashkelon and he slayed thirty
[27:17] men he slayed thirty Philistines you
[27:21] know and it was at that time Samson
[27:24] began to hate the Philistines he began
[27:27] to to want to
[27:29] murder every one of them kill them all
[27:32] and so he goes to Ashkelon he slew 30
[27:37] min there and so then after you know
[27:40] calms down you know you that get mad you
[27:45] you're all mad right and then you come
[27:48] down here look okay huh
[27:50] back to my senses back to reality right
[27:55] so then he's back to reality again right
[27:59] so he goes back and his dad thought he
[28:03] hated his wife so much he gave him to
[28:06] his best friend gave his wife to his
[28:10] best friend so there goes Samson he's
[28:12] furious again he takes off so then he
[28:17] starts to think about here he is on that
[28:19] you know right he's all ticked off and
[28:25] when he gets back he says I'm gonna I'm
[28:30] gonna take a sacrifice for my wife I'm
[28:33] gonna get her back
[28:34] so reconciles everything with his woman
[28:37] and everything is good but he's still so
[28:42] mad at the Philistines if I could just
[28:44] do something to get back at them and I
[28:48] could just do a really good number on
[28:49] him so then what does he do now I don't
[28:53] know about you but I have a dog outside
[28:57] and if she makes me mad I can't catch
[29:02] her there's no way I get mad I start
[29:05] throwing stuff at her but you imagine
[29:09] that right Samson goes on catches 300
[29:12] foxes how in the world I can't even
[29:18] catch a dog this is this is and you got
[29:21] to remember to every time
[29:23] Samson would do this if the Bible says
[29:26] the Spirit of the Lord will come upon
[29:28] him so we know we know that it wasn't
[29:31] just an average man that was doing it it
[29:35] was a man that was anointed by the
[29:36] Spirit of God and he was born for a
[29:39] purpose right you guys believe you're
[29:42] born for a purpose
[29:43] you were born for a purpose to make me
[29:46] smile yes you were
[29:48] so Samson he was born for a purpose his
[29:53] purpose was to defeat the Philistines to
[29:57] deliver the children of Israel out of
[29:59] the hands of the Philistine so here he
[30:02] goes he catches three hundred foxes how
[30:05] I don't know but he catches them but he
[30:09] didn't just catch him now I'm not
[30:11] talking to you this story so you guys
[30:13] could go do bad things like like things
[30:15] on fire but what he did let me tell you
[30:17] what he did I had a brother your dad he
[30:22] loved fire but anyways that's another
[30:27] story he lit the tails of these foxes on
[30:32] fire and what did he do he sent them
[30:36] through the fields of corn burned all
[30:38] their corn all their vineyards he burnt
[30:42] all of their olive trees God the
[30:46] Philistines were they were fit to be
[30:48] tied this time that was it so they were
[30:51] so mad they're like who in the world did
[30:54] this and here here's a guy he's a little
[30:57] tattletale I don't know what I think it
[30:59] was that guy over there that that you
[31:01] know married that you know Philistine
[31:04] girl he's all crazy killing people go
[31:08] ask him
[31:09] so they go looking for Samson like
[31:12] where's this guy so they go to that to
[31:15] to the men of Judah and they're like
[31:17] where's where's the idiot that let all
[31:21] these fields on fur get him over here
[31:23] now and they're like we don't know what
[31:26] you're talking about why are you coming
[31:28] against us and said well we know it was
[31:30] Samson so go find him bring him over
[31:32] here or we're gonna kill everybody here
[31:35] so here goes here goes the manager I
[31:40] mean you gotta understand okay you
[31:42] remember the movie Lion King right you
[31:44] ever see Lion King okay do you remember
[31:47] whenever the hyenas would say
[31:54] you remember that right Mufasa did get
[32:02] all scared right well that's how they
[32:05] were about Sampson man they say Samson
[32:10] Samson so here's the men of Judah you
[32:14] did Judah they thought I'd go get him so
[32:22] they go and they say I'm not going by
[32:25] myself get about three thousand minutes
[32:28] tie that guy up he's crazy I know the
[32:31] purpose that because see these were
[32:33] these were children of Israel now they
[32:35] knew the purpose that that Samson was
[32:39] born for because he when Samson was born
[32:42] in the house of Dan that's that he grew
[32:46] up with the Danah Knights which that's
[32:48] one of the tribes of Israel so when he
[32:52] they went to they went to that when he
[32:54] was born as a little boy the Bible says
[32:57] the Spirit of the Lord will move upon
[32:58] him you imagine come hear me if like
[33:02] this little boy would just pick up a big
[33:06] ol something that was ten times his size
[33:09] and carry it somewhere those were the
[33:11] things those were the things that were
[33:13] going on when Samson was a little boy so
[33:16] they knew the purpose that he was born
[33:18] for so I said oh no we're gonna we need
[33:21] some of the best people who know this
[33:23] guy
[33:23] we need about 3,000 men go up there and
[33:27] I know he's up on that hill up there
[33:28] when I have time to come down here I
[33:31] don't know why we're gonna do it they
[33:34] were scared took three 3,000 men to go
[33:37] get him so they go and get him and there
[33:41] he is and he says what are you guys here
[33:43] for says you you gotta go pay to pay
[33:46] your do man these these Philistines are
[33:49] gonna they're gonna wipe us out get down
[33:52] there and face face what you've done
[33:55] so he says I'll do it he says but you've
[33:59] got to promise me that you guys aren't
[34:01] gonna try to kill me yourself and as
[34:03] long as you promise you're not going to
[34:05] kill me I'll go so here he goes they go
[34:08] only tie them up imagine they have
[34:11] Samson tied up prophet who God tells us
[34:13] Samson wasn't this big oh dude like wow
[34:16] I'm not that big like like Big Mac yeah
[34:22] that you imagine like not not like that
[34:25] I won't use another example because
[34:27] somebody might get hurt you know but he
[34:30] was a scrawny fellow Samson wasn't a big
[34:33] guy we know that from the Prophet he
[34:36] wasn't this big old like up image that
[34:38] they placed that he had to all these
[34:39] muscles and real big no no no sir he was
[34:43] a skinny little guy anointed by the
[34:46] power of Almighty God that's what Samson
[34:49] was so they go and they deliver him
[34:54] they're happy whoo-hoo we just got away
[34:56] with one right now we're gonna live they
[35:00] deliver him to the Philistines then the
[35:03] Philistines make a major error they
[35:05] start to get all huffy with him think
[35:08] they're gonna take him down there was a
[35:10] thousand of these men okay
[35:12] and Samson and we all know the story
[35:15] that part right Samson with the jawbone
[35:18] of a donkey now I know you're looking at
[35:22] this and you're saying that brother that
[35:24] way too big but over here you might have
[35:28] little donkeys okay where I come from
[35:32] this is normal size of a donkey okay so
[35:37] he comes with he sees a new job bone of
[35:41] a donkey picks it up and he slays a
[35:44] thousand Philistines just wiped them out
[35:47] clean
[35:47] and so here's Samson this is the part of
[35:52] the story
[35:52] many people don't hear that it's the
[35:56] most tremendous and amazing thing that
[35:59] I've ever heard
[36:00] so after he slays them here he is tired
[36:04] just wasted and he says Lord you
[36:09] wouldn't have delivered a thousand of
[36:11] them Philistines into my hand for me to
[36:13] just die a thirst here you guys heard
[36:17] this so
[36:20] he's dying of thirst and just like the
[36:23] rock that that was with the children of
[36:27] Israel in the desert all of the sudden
[36:30] God caused a hollow place in that jaw
[36:34] bone and it began to flow with water and
[36:38] as Samson is there and one starts to
[36:40] drink oh oh and the Bible says he was he
[36:44] was besides himself he he was almost
[36:46] losing it like going crazy and he starts
[36:49] to drink he starts get his wits back oh
[36:51] thanks oh and that is the power of our
[36:57] God that we serve so if you're ever
[37:00] wondering how powerful God is he was not
[37:03] only going to take us through the storm
[37:05] but he's going to give us what we need
[37:08] after the storm that's the most amazing
[37:11] part to me about the story of Samson so
[37:15] time goes on and now the Philistines are
[37:20] like there's nothing we can do to beat
[37:23] this guy I don't know
[37:25] we know that it is a power of Almighty
[37:28] God that lives inside of him there's no
[37:30] explaining it there's no explanation
[37:33] there's no way we could figure it out
[37:35] so then he goes to Gaza he goes to Gaza
[37:44] at this point Mufasa is everywhere
[37:49] they're scared oh my god Samson is going
[37:54] to just wipe us out at any given moment
[37:56] we could just die so every morning the
[37:59] Philistines when they leave their
[38:00] household manual Majan how many times
[38:02] they'd kiss mom you know whenever you
[38:04] guys are leaving and you're gonna have a
[38:07] rough day ahead of you and you go man I
[38:08] better go kiss my mom oh I better go
[38:10] kiss my dad you know that's how these
[38:13] these guys were man like any given
[38:16] moment I'm gonna lose my life I'm gonna
[38:18] die so then they goes to Gaza and now
[38:23] they have tabs on Samson everywhere he
[38:25] goes we're gonna have to trap this guy
[38:28] so he's in Gaza and they closed the
[38:32] gates in on him
[38:34] okay close the gates in on him they said
[38:37] we don't want to mess with him leave him
[38:39] there
[38:39] we'll bring thousands of men and we'll
[38:43] just kill him in the morning and so why
[38:48] he does does something really amazing he
[38:51] wakes up at midnight why because he's a
[38:55] man of God and he listens to everything
[38:58] that God tells every warning that he
[39:01] gives so like the way your mom tells you
[39:04] hey don't do that that's bad you
[39:07] shouldn't be acting that way you
[39:09] shouldn't be doing this you shouldn't be
[39:10] doing that right that's a warning from
[39:12] your parents well that's the way God was
[39:15] with Samson he'd give him warnings so
[39:18] here's Samson you know and you read the
[39:21] story and it says that he took those
[39:24] gates upon his back at midnight in the
[39:27] middle of the night he goes and throws
[39:30] those gates on his back and the Bible
[39:32] says he carries a month onto a hill but
[39:35] it doesn't tell you that Hill was 30
[39:38] miles away my wall
[39:41] he carries those gates for 30 miles
[39:46] not just the gates the pillars and every
[39:50] luck they had on that gate was on there
[39:52] and he carries that 30 miles I can't
[39:56] even carry one of my kids a block he
[40:03] carried the gates and everything for 30
[40:05] miles that's them and and every time
[40:09] remember every time the Bible tells you
[40:13] the Spirit of the Lord came upon him and
[40:16] that's when he was not a normal man so
[40:20] that's what happens in Gaza now now he
[40:24] meets Delilah right and when he meets
[40:28] Delilah he falls in love with her right
[40:32] away like I did with Jenny same thing
[40:38] falls in love with her love at first
[40:42] sight
[40:44] he loved her and the Philistines stars
[40:47] they saw this girl you know let's go
[40:53] talk to the ground try to bribe her like
[40:55] we did his wife so they go and tell her
[40:59] if you could find out the secret of his
[41:02] heart
[41:03] we'll give you a thousand pieces of
[41:05] silver I know I don't sound like much
[41:08] you guys are looking at me a bunch of
[41:11] nickels
[41:12] no this was a thousand pieces of silver
[41:16] that she would be rich she'd be taken
[41:18] care of for her mom and dad everybody
[41:21] around her you're taking care of for the
[41:23] rest of her life so she takes the bribe
[41:27] and so they tell him well you know the
[41:31] story kind of running out of time here
[41:34] they there's three things that that she
[41:38] tells him to do the first thing she
[41:40] tells him bind him with green wits that
[41:44] hadn't been dried yet and when you when
[41:47] you when you bind him with those
[41:49] Samson's telling lies when you buy me
[41:52] with those it's like I don't have no
[41:54] strength I have no strength just as a
[41:57] normal man so there she goes who binds
[42:00] him Philistines are upon you Samson
[42:06] starts killing everybody again say like
[42:09] you lied to me you mocked me and told me
[42:13] lies as she tells him is there something
[42:17] okay okay I'll tell you this time for
[42:21] real says if you buy me with new ropes
[42:24] that have never been occupied I'll have
[42:29] a strength of any other man so here she
[42:33] goes a little sneaky girl ties him up
[42:36] with new ropes that had never been
[42:39] occupied
[42:42] Philistines are upon thee Samson apart
[42:45] like a thread yeah I'm right here you
[42:51] gotta watch it sneaky so she's all mad
[42:56] she's sayin
[42:57] you lie to me again and he goes yeah
[43:04] I'll tell you this time for reals if you
[43:08] put a web on my head and braid my locs
[43:11] or and put a pin in it I have the
[43:15] strength of any other man so Philistines
[43:19] are upon me something goes up does the
[43:21] same thing like forget it I give up on
[43:24] you and the Bible says that she pressed
[43:28] him daily she pressed him every day to
[43:31] tell her the truth finally he told her
[43:34] the secret of his heart he told her I
[43:36] was born through the vowel the Nazarite
[43:39] if a razor came upon my head and you
[43:43] shaved my head I'd have the strength of
[43:45] any other man so she knows that this
[43:49] time he told the truth
[43:51] he says she calls Philistine they bring
[43:53] the money and everything he says she's
[43:56] told me all the secrets of his heart so
[43:59] we know that when he got up he tried to
[44:02] shake himself couldn't do it so then so
[44:10] then they captured him
[44:12] the very first thing they did he plucked
[44:14] out his eyes right can you imagine how
[44:18] Samson felt at that point all his whole
[44:22] life he always could feel the presence
[44:26] of the Lord come upon him and then have
[44:30] to live in a time to where he couldn't
[44:33] have no interaction with God he could
[44:37] never feel the Spirit of the Lord come
[44:39] upon him
[44:40] oh what a misery what a miserable time
[44:43] for him right what a horrible day that
[44:46] would be that must have been for Samson
[44:48] and not only that but the very thing he
[44:52] was he was brought to this earth for he
[44:57] was now captured by the Philistines the
[44:59] very people he was called to destroy to
[45:05] deliver the children of Israel from now
[45:08] he was their prisoner
[45:10] well that must have been really really
[45:13] though time for Samson so here he's
[45:17] grinding in the prison house and when he
[45:22] comes out of the prison that you know
[45:25] the Philistines the Lords of the
[45:27] Philistines they're all pumped up and
[45:28] happy they're like our God Dagon he
[45:33] delivered you know our enemy Samson into
[45:37] our hands what a great God we serve so
[45:40] he said you know what we're gonna do all
[45:42] the Lords of the Philistines said let's
[45:45] throw a big party let's bring everybody
[45:49] here and we'll bring Samson out as sport
[45:53] to make fun of him and spit on him and
[45:56] do all these ugly horrible things to him
[46:01] so here's this little boy Samson can't
[46:04] see but we heard AJ his hair began to
[46:09] grow they weren't paying attention and
[46:11] his hair had just started to grow just a
[46:14] little bit and as they began to grow he
[46:18] tells them take me to the pillar and
[46:22] there all the Lords of the Philistines
[46:25] are and they take him and he puts his
[46:28] left hand on one pillar his right hand
[46:31] on another he boughs his head to the
[46:34] Lord he says Lord one more time just one
[46:39] more time Lord let your spirit come upon
[46:43] me and let me fulfill the very purpose
[46:46] you made me for Lord and there's Samson
[46:50] in the midst of those pillars boughs his
[46:52] head and the last words that he says is
[46:55] he says let me die with the Philistines
[46:58] and he pulls those pillars apart with
[47:03] all his might they all come crashing
[47:05] down and they kill everybody there and
[47:07] that was the day that God delivered the
[47:11] felis the Israelites out of the hands of
[47:14] the Philistines was that day and see you
[47:18] find an important story here is that the
[47:22] god of those times
[47:24] I am so glad AJ read that scripture God
[47:28] is the same yesterday today and forever
[47:31] because the same God that was with
[47:34] Sampson if you look around you see that
[47:38] he is the same God of today he's here
[47:43] with us aren't you glad that you could
[47:45] feel the Spirit of the Lord every time
[47:47] you come to church isn't it such a
[47:50] blessing to come to me this is the
[47:52] biggest party I love everybody here
