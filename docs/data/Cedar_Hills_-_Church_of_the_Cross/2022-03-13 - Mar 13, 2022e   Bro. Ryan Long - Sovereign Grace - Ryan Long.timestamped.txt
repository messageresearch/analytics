[54:35] it's not just one time
[54:38] so the devil he continues to come in
[54:40] like a flood right
[54:43] and every day or every week it seems
[54:45] worse and worse and worse

[54:50] used to raise the standard
[54:53] above where the devil is coming in
[54:56] that was a tremendous word to us
[55:00] two three years ago
[55:03] now the lord is raising you up

[55:54] just number one how many appreciate your
[55:56] music department and your worship
[55:58] department
[56:04] amen
[56:05] amen let's read ezekiel chapter 9.
[56:11] and um
[56:12] i didn't
[56:14] well i actually didn't even know to
[56:15] maybe just a little while ago
[56:19] what i thought i would would talk about
[56:22] and i had an i had a note written down
[56:27] i happened to look at that note this
[56:29] afternoon
[56:32] and it had a definition of a word on it
[56:36] that definition happened to match
[56:37] exactly the definition read this morning
[56:55] start with verse one
[56:59] he cried also in mine ears with a loud
[57:01] voice saying cause them to have charge
[57:03] over the city to draw near even every
[57:05] man with his destroying weapon in his
[57:08] hand
[57:17] and behold six men came from the way of
[57:18] the higher gate which lies towards the
[57:20] north and every man a slaughter weapon
[57:22] in his hand and one man among them was
[57:24] clothed with linen with a writer's ink
[57:26] horn by his side and they went in and
[57:28] stood beside the brazen altar
[57:53] and the glory of the of the god of
[57:55] israel was gone up from the cherub
[57:56] whereupon he was to the threshold of the
[57:59] house and he called to the man clothed
[58:01] with linen which had the writer's ink
[58:03] horn by his side
[58:06] is
[58:18] this is a scripture i think we probably
[58:20] are familiar with at least a portion of
[58:22] it
[58:26] and the lord said unto him go through
[58:28] the midst of the city through the midst
[58:31] of jerusalem
[58:32] and set a mark upon the foreheads
[58:35] of the men that sigh and that cry for
[58:37] all the abominations that be done in the
[58:40] midst thereof
[58:43] foreign
[58:58] a lot of ways you could take this
[59:00] scripture and talk about it
[59:05] but but
[59:07] maybe we'll just go down a certain path
[59:08] this morning okay if i just stay real
[59:10] simple real easy
[59:14] probably something that you know already
[59:22] sometimes we know so much and and you
[59:25] know the the word will say what are you
[59:26] doing as we heard this morning with what
[59:28] you already know uh
[59:41] you know and this
[59:43] this is talking about
[59:44] a mark put upon a people established
[59:50] or really a a type of person
[59:53] and we know if you if you if you study
[59:55] in in the message in the word
[1:00:13] the purpose that god has set them to do
[1:00:15] yes
[1:00:17] and that purpose
[1:00:18] is to sigh and decry for the
[1:00:20] abominations that are done
[1:00:26] now what is that what does that mean
[1:00:29] you know i i have heard just through my
[1:00:32] life
[1:00:34] a lot of different definitions of that
[1:00:36] phrase different definition
[1:00:38] and the one that always
[1:00:40] what i was told most commonly
[1:00:44] it didn't have a good ring to me
[1:00:48] it was almost that you saw that sin was
[1:00:50] being done
[1:00:54] and the attitude was that you look kind
[1:00:56] of looked down upon them
[1:01:00] that there was a person that maybe was
[1:01:02] was not living right
[1:01:05] yeah in in that you kind of turned up
[1:01:07] your nose a little bit at it
[1:01:10] well you know and the bible gives an
[1:01:12] example of this
[1:01:14] when there's two men that go to the
[1:01:15] temple to pray
[1:01:18] and one of them is praying lord you know
[1:01:20] what i said you give me
[1:01:22] i'm a
[1:01:36] and i want to tell you let's get all
[1:01:37] this that is not
[1:01:39] sighing and crying for the sin that is
[1:01:41] done
[1:01:44] that that you know certainly anybody
[1:01:48] that that the lord has saved or
[1:01:50] delivered
[1:02:02] you want every single person
[1:02:15] that means you want it for joe biden
[1:02:18] or donald trump
[1:02:44] i don't care what they've said
[1:02:45] lokiandicho
[1:02:52] now i can say i don't agree with that
[1:02:54] well that's it
[1:02:56] that doesn't line up in the bible
[1:02:58] i don't know if that's right
[1:03:00] but my attitude
[1:03:02] towards them
[1:03:04] it doesn't say anything about them no
[1:03:06] this is not about the age it says
[1:03:08] something about me
[1:03:10] and and i want you to know that the
[1:03:12] bible says
[1:03:40] and it's not it's not being comfortable
[1:03:42] in in your home church no although that
[1:03:44] day for your household
[1:03:46] it's good that you keep your household
[1:03:48] sanctified
[1:03:50] what happens in the neighbor's house
[1:03:51] happens in your house
[1:03:54] but if we have the real real spirit of
[1:03:56] christ it's the name of the spirit of
[1:03:58] the critic
[1:03:58] concerned with what's happening in my
[1:04:00] neighbor's house
[1:04:03] because i want him to be saved
[1:04:05] i want him to know the savior that i
[1:04:07] know
[1:04:10] i was him
[1:04:19] [Music]
[1:04:22] had enough spirit of christ to
[1:04:24] sufficient
[1:04:31] and that's how the lord works did you
[1:04:33] know that
[1:04:34] that is how the lord works
[1:04:38] why would he
[1:04:39] want you and i
[1:04:41] used to be praying for somebody else
[1:04:45] he could just reach out to himself
[1:04:49] can god do whatever he wants to no
[1:04:51] puerto rico
[1:05:18] i'm telling you this is so basic it
[1:05:19] probably doesn't get more basic
[1:05:34] my whole life
[1:06:03] that someone else needs that same thing
[1:06:07] amen amen
[1:06:09] now i know it's hard yosek is defeated
[1:06:12] i know it's hard jose question to
[1:06:15] concentrate on someone else
[1:06:58] right now you could say i don't know
[1:07:01] about that brother well it's here
[1:07:03] and you know you would be just fine but
[1:07:05] let's go to the bible
[1:07:07] and let's go to the word and see if we
[1:07:08] can
[1:07:10] we can find that
[1:07:13] you know i i think they have a couple of
[1:07:15] uh quotes do you mind if we read a quote
[1:07:17] that's gonna see
[1:07:19] everybody still all right yeah you're so
[1:07:21] glad you came on time
[1:07:24] to tell you how you should live no this
[1:07:26] where should come over i i still say
[1:07:28] this i think every pulpit should just
[1:07:29] have a big mirror
[1:07:34] like brother caleb said you were beat up
[1:07:36] before you got here that's how the holy
[1:07:37] spirit works
[1:07:49] let's go to that first quote if you
[1:07:50] don't mind i think they have that
[1:07:54] sister brother do you know the bible
[1:07:56] just said for the holy ghost to mark
[1:07:58] those who sigh and cry for the
[1:08:00] abominations did in the city i want to
[1:08:02] ask you a question i'm sorry go ahead
[1:08:05] hermana
[1:08:12] you forgive me i'm not i'm not
[1:08:13] accustomed to an interpreter anymore so
[1:08:16] now i want to ask you a question
[1:08:19] we make so much motion over our
[1:08:20] religious ideas
[1:08:56] now listen he's not even talking about
[1:08:58] the other things you pray for
[1:09:04] praying for the sins of the city
[1:09:06] but according to the scriptures
[1:09:08] the angel of god was only to seal those
[1:09:11] who sighed and cried for the abomination
[1:09:17] we're not interested no more
[1:09:23] we want to know that we can have a
[1:09:25] little society in our church
[1:09:28] we want to know that we got a vote
[1:09:30] coming when it comes time to elect the
[1:09:31] next pastor okay
[1:10:28] [Music]
[1:10:56] but
[1:11:22] that's good old-fashioned castor oil
[1:11:38] i assume that's kind of like pulling
[1:11:40] teeth maybe for our time
[1:11:43] we ought to be on our knees crying for
[1:11:45] the sin and the abomination
[1:11:50] grace that's done in the city
[1:12:07] so we have the greatest congregation
[1:12:09] sunday
[1:12:11] domingo all stay home sunday night look
[1:12:13] at the television well we didn't do that
[1:12:15] tonight
[1:12:17] didn't do that tonight
[1:12:20] now listen
[1:12:22] are you still are you still happy
[1:12:24] let's go over to ephesians 2.
[1:12:27] that's real now that that's real cutting
[1:12:29] all right
[1:12:31] thank the lord that he just starts to go
[1:12:33] to chopping on us
[1:12:48] in
[1:13:00] and you uh we'll start with verse one
[1:13:02] you have he quickened who were dead in
[1:13:04] trespasses and sins
[1:13:11] that's good
[1:13:14] how many
[1:13:16] can say you know i don't know if i
[1:13:18] belong in that group
[1:13:21] how many could say
[1:13:22] i was dead in trespasses
[1:13:28] now
[1:13:30] let's be careful all right
[1:13:32] we don't act like
[1:13:35] we don't belong in that scripture
[1:13:39] we see sin going on
[1:13:42] nothing but a sinner
[1:13:44] kids let's
[1:14:08] let's just keep reading here wearing in
[1:14:10] time past
[1:14:12] ye walked
[1:14:16] so even if i don't like to put myself in
[1:14:17] that first scripture
[1:14:19] he's going to put me in there for me
[1:14:23] according to the course of this world
[1:14:54] god
[1:14:56] will sometimes keep that a secret from
[1:14:58] you
[1:15:01] so you don't know which one has that
[1:15:03] nostalgia
[1:15:04] so that you will show the spirit of
[1:15:06] christ
[1:15:11] amen amen
[1:15:13] among whom also we had our conversation
[1:15:16] in times past
[1:15:17] in the lusts of our flesh
[1:15:36] that's a that's a mirror of the of god's
[1:15:39] word
[1:15:41] this is who you were it is
[1:15:44] this is who i was looking at no longer
[1:15:46] that person
[1:15:48] is a person but he's bringing into your
[1:15:50] remembrance for a purpose
[1:15:53] now but god who is rich in mercy
[1:16:00] we could just stop right there
[1:16:03] who is rich in mercy yesterday
[1:16:06] where in for his great love wherewith he
[1:16:10] loved us
[1:16:13] when did he love you
[1:16:15] when you were dead in sin
[1:16:43] and hath raised us up together and made
[1:16:45] us sit together in heavenly places in
[1:16:47] christ jesus christ
[1:16:54] that in the ages to come
[1:16:59] he might show the exceeding i love this
[1:17:01] now all right
[1:17:04] god is rich in mercy amen
[1:17:07] is exceedingly rich
[1:17:13] the scripture isn't just there
[1:17:14] accidentally
[1:17:22] the exceeding riches of his grace in his
[1:17:24] kindness towards us through christ jesus
[1:17:28] requested
[1:17:55] because you sighed and cried for
[1:17:56] yourself
[1:18:21] because he knew they would do exactly
[1:18:23] what he would do
[1:18:33] i want to talk about that i i don't know
[1:18:35] if i'll have time for that i want to
[1:18:36] talk about those ages
[1:19:19] or had a hard time with
[1:19:34] by not continuing in perfect love for no
[1:19:36] continuation
[1:19:37] amen
[1:19:38] amen he says the corinthian church but
[1:19:41] just the church
[1:19:42] he said you you want to go after signs
[1:19:45] and you want to go after speaking in
[1:19:46] tongues
[1:19:48] and i can't
[1:20:02] martin's age martin luther king
[1:20:06] he said it didn't it didn't surprise him
[1:20:07] he could stand with against the catholic
[1:20:09] church
[1:20:13] it is surprising that he could keep his
[1:20:15] head above the fanaticism that followed
[1:20:29] every age had a spirit that was meant
[1:20:31] for that age that got them through that
[1:20:33] age
[1:20:35] okay
[1:20:36] what made the lesson it was different
[1:20:38] no we didn't have to be uh we didn't
[1:20:40] have to go through and be a martyr
[1:20:43] they had a spirit for that age that
[1:20:44] allowed
[1:20:48] and and what what the lord is trying to
[1:20:50] get to us in this scripture
[1:20:53] is that now in this age
[1:20:57] our our church age
[1:21:01] now i want to ask you when is the last
[1:21:02] what is the last day
[1:21:08] when is this last
[1:21:09] church age happening
[1:21:26] in this church age
[1:21:29] we have all things combined together
[1:21:34] so where they had a portion of the word
[1:21:35] in another age
[1:21:38] oh the word in this age
[1:21:53] they had a weakness for their age
[1:21:57] every weakness
[1:22:01] we have every weakness in this age
[1:22:04] but we have every single strength that
[1:22:06] has ever existed in this age
[1:22:21] is
[1:22:50] you have you you have i'm talking to you
[1:22:52] the last church age now i have london
[1:22:55] every failure
[1:22:57] how many feel that one
[1:22:59] how many feel like sometimes there isn't
[1:23:01] one thing i won't fail
[1:23:17] sometimes we fail god by the minute
[1:23:25] it seems like oh i did that yesterday
[1:23:28] did that an hour ago
[1:23:30] sometimes it's just our thoughts
[1:23:51] but you'll start to have a victory every
[1:23:54] minute of the day
[1:23:58] nobody can think back to the last time
[1:23:59] they had a victory
[1:24:14] is
[1:24:21] you know and he's talking about in the
[1:24:22] ages to come now jesus faced all those
[1:24:24] things
[1:24:27] he faced all those things
[1:24:30] but in one person but a persona and what
[1:24:32] he wanted to do
[1:24:34] the same thing
[1:24:41] all things are going to be in one body
[1:24:46] one worldwide body
[1:24:50] governed by the same spirit
[1:24:52] that dwelled in him
[1:24:55] i hope we believe that because if not
[1:24:56] we're
[1:25:07] i told you that
[1:25:09] i'd get to
[1:25:10] this
[1:25:25] and
[1:25:28] i started to think about this subject
[1:25:32] and i was listening to a message
[1:25:35] called the message of grace
[1:25:52] he says you and i usted
[1:25:55] killed his son
[1:25:58] we killed the son of god
[1:26:01] you see him hanging on the cross he says
[1:26:04] we hung him up there love
[1:26:21] if that doesn't get you excited
[1:26:24] then you have forgotten what he has done
[1:26:29] because we killed his son
[1:26:31] and he justly could have sent us to
[1:26:33] hello
[1:26:56] and in this message
[1:26:57] what i wanted to get to is this
[1:26:58] exceeding riches of his
[1:27:02] grace i started to think about the
[1:27:04] message brother branham preached
[1:27:07] when divine love is projected
[1:27:11] grace takes his place
[1:27:15] he preaches it several times
[1:27:18] such a good message
[1:27:21] excuse me i'd put that on your your
[1:27:23] i'm just going to give you
[1:27:24] recommendations brother caleb
[1:27:26] if you haven't heard it go back and hear
[1:27:28] though
[1:27:44] but the beautiful part is that he's
[1:27:46] giving you an opportunity
[1:27:50] to do what he's done
[1:27:52] and i thought about this
[1:27:54] can i read you the definition of
[1:27:56] sovereignty
[1:28:10] supreme power rank
[1:28:29] i love this definition i hope that you
[1:28:32] love it
[1:28:34] unlimited in extent
[1:28:40] oh brother i know somebody but they're
[1:28:41] just too far gone to be safe
[1:28:45] not for the grace of god
[1:28:48] no no no not for the grace of god
[1:28:51] and who it can accentuate
[1:29:04] you know i used to if i could just be a
[1:29:06] little bit honest with you
[1:29:08] never
[1:29:20] i never really i just didn't like the
[1:29:22] what i thought about it
[1:29:25] let me explain before they they got real
[1:29:27] quiet they had explico
[1:29:30] what i thought it was is that
[1:29:32] god is going to have grace
[1:29:36] and he'll do it on who he feels like
[1:29:37] having grace
[1:29:42] scriptures in the bible
[1:29:45] that talk about disgrace
[1:29:48] that we do not continue in sin that
[1:29:49] grace may abound yeah
[1:30:13] and i would just pray lord have grace
[1:30:15] yes the lord lord may you have grace on
[1:30:16] this senor
[1:30:17] may you have grace on this
[1:30:19] but that's not what the word is talking
[1:30:21] about
[1:30:26] you do have
[1:30:27] us
[1:30:28] the ability to have love
[1:30:32] you know that right
[1:30:35] you can have love
[1:30:38] on anyone you choose to have love
[1:30:45] and what it does
[1:30:47] is exactly what the prophet said it does
[1:30:50] exactly
[1:30:53] that that divine love amor di vino now
[1:30:56] listen oh that's good you could say
[1:30:58] brother i don't know if my love is
[1:30:59] divine
[1:31:05] and see how long that lasts with your
[1:31:08] your carnal love
[1:31:14] but try loving a sinner i want to read a
[1:31:16] quote i hope lord willing in a minute
[1:31:18] just cuts right to the bone
[1:31:23] you have been given as believers
[1:31:27] the ability to aim
[1:31:30] the sovereign grace of god
[1:31:36] that
[1:31:38] now if you don't have character
[1:31:41] that's a power we don't
[1:31:42] belong that's right
[1:31:44] it's not a it's a power we don't belong
[1:31:46] to wielding as we heard this morning
[1:31:55] let's read that if you have that quote
[1:32:00] i know it
[1:32:03] let's just read this this is talking
[1:32:04] about now you you think i can't have
[1:32:06] that brother i don't know if i can have
[1:32:07] that kind of love
[1:32:09] you know what
[1:32:10] the second time
[1:32:11] this
[1:32:12] this is talking about that that colored
[1:32:14] woman in in memphis
[1:32:18] his plane got landed and he started
[1:32:20] going for a walk
[1:32:22] he says
[1:32:24] at the end of this
[1:32:36] sovereign grace isn't just out there
[1:32:38] doing what it feels like
[1:32:41] directed
[1:32:43] by divine love
[1:32:45] this is i want to talk about this
[1:32:47] sovereignty a little bit you know
[1:32:49] you know
[1:32:49] that god has a law
[1:32:52] god wrote laws
[1:32:54] you know that sovereign grace gracious
[1:32:56] he doesn't have to follow us
[1:32:58] did you know that
[1:33:00] you know that sovereign grace can do
[1:33:01] whatever it wants
[1:33:04] god can write a law and says
[1:33:05] brother tommy if you do this but you're
[1:33:08] going to die
[1:33:11] it doesn't have to follow that law
[1:33:16] because it's above
[1:33:17] the law
[1:33:20] sovereignty
[1:33:21] now god can say this is going to happen
[1:33:22] this can happen he set the law but then
[1:33:24] he created or then he had his own
[1:33:27] yes
[1:33:34] and i'll read it from you from the from
[1:33:35] the quote
[1:33:37] he needs it to be directed
[1:33:43] let's let's go to the next one the
[1:33:45] second time
[1:33:53] if there's a next there we go you know
[1:33:55] god so loved the world
[1:33:59] you people here tonight
[1:34:30] we're familiar with this have you ever
[1:34:31] seen people you just want to be around
[1:34:37] it's the atmosphere they create around
[1:34:39] them
[1:34:43] other others nice people that you can't
[1:34:46] you can't stand to be around
[1:34:50] i hope nobody came to your mind right
[1:34:52] now
[1:34:55] if they if they did you should go talk
[1:34:57] to them
[1:34:58] and ask some forgiveness
[1:35:01] and maybe tell them a little bit about
[1:35:02] it
[1:35:04] i just throw that in there to be a
[1:35:05] little bit light
[1:35:08] when love has been projected
[1:35:12] this is cut off does it say that it's
[1:35:14] time
[1:35:17] time for sovereign grace to step in
[1:35:22] we'll do it
[1:35:24] every time
[1:36:02] no
[1:36:03] because if somebody is being obedient to
[1:36:06] that spirit
[1:36:08] brother must say
[1:36:22] i always start off with praying for
[1:36:23] myself yes oh lord i'm this kind of
[1:36:25] person i'm sorry for this you forgive me
[1:36:29] and god he's saying now brother braham
[1:36:32] says now someone else
[1:36:34] will pray for you alignment
[1:36:50] he's going to use somebody
[1:36:53] listen who's no better than i am
[1:36:56] to give me the gift of sovereign grace
[1:37:02] no better than anybody
[1:37:04] to direct
[1:37:15] i think there's another one
[1:37:17] divine love is projected resulting in
[1:37:19] sovereign grace taking its place
[1:37:28] divine love can only go so far
[1:38:02] no i don't have the ability to have
[1:38:03] sovereign grace
[1:38:06] i have the ability to have love for
[1:38:08] somebody
[1:38:10] but when it is held to the end
[1:38:14] uh
[1:38:29] this is not this is not my word no it's
[1:38:30] me this is the lord god it's
[1:38:33] through a mouthpiece saying
[1:38:35] that is not what the church needs
[1:38:39] that's what the church needs looking
[1:38:40] this is
[1:38:41] not a new organization
[1:38:53] it needs the baptism of love
[1:39:10] race
[1:39:22] it's
[1:39:24] that scripture sign and crime
[1:39:28] i have a meaning to us
[1:39:31] such a meaning to us
[1:39:34] let me ask you this
[1:39:36] what is your salvation
[1:39:52] only
[1:40:20] they will not be worried about making it
[1:40:22] there no
[1:40:24] yeah they will be praying for somebody
[1:40:26] else
[1:40:29] now brother that's hard to do
[1:40:32] easy to say
[1:40:33] but it's hard to get down but
[1:40:36] and not
[1:40:37] worry about yourself
[1:40:40] which is exactly why god put it in it
[1:40:44] that's exactly why he put it in there
[1:40:46] because it goes against
[1:40:48] our nature
[1:41:16] this question you get about half of the
[1:41:18] hands go up he says
[1:41:21] you know that if you don't
[1:41:23] feel like you have the holy spirit
[1:41:26] you should still raise your hand
[1:41:28] because you're not gonna get it unless
[1:41:30] you have faith and claim that you have
[1:41:32] the holy spirit for getting a faith
[1:41:35] that's the basic bible have you received
[1:41:36] the holy ghost
[1:41:39] how many here have the holy spirit
[1:41:44] now may god honor your faith
[1:41:48] and produce the results of the holy
[1:41:50] spirit
[1:41:52] same thing that it did back there
[1:41:55] divine love yeah
[1:42:15] you know
[1:42:16] there's never been a gun
[1:42:19] briefly that's killed anything
[1:42:22] it only aims the bullet
[1:42:31] and we aim where the sovereign grace of
[1:42:34] god is
[1:42:37] that is a big
[1:42:40] responsibility and and i just want to
[1:42:43] i'll just close with this
[1:42:46] i think by doing that
[1:42:48] you say brother the true believer is
[1:42:50] going to do this
[1:42:54] i think when you do
[1:43:09] and that's what the believer will have
[1:43:10] is the spirit of christ
[1:43:13] i'll leave you with exactly the same
[1:43:14] thing he said
[1:43:17] don't pray for yourself
[1:43:21] pray for somebody else
[1:44:02] to get the strength to know who they are
[1:44:13] and i'm telling you
[1:44:15] this goes so beyond the way that i would
[1:44:17] do it
[1:44:32] because
[1:44:46] christ
[1:44:50] and
[1:44:50] and i just want to encourage you to do
[1:44:52] the same thing
[1:44:54] and watch what takes place in your life
[1:44:59] things that you you didn't even
[1:45:20] bendigo
