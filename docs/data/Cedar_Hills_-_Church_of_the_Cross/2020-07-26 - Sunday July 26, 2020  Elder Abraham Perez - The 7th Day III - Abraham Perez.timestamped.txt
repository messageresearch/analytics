[22:02] just how good he can be and there's
[22:05] nothing
[22:06] not a one thing nothing greater than god
[22:11] [Music]
[22:17] i can't imagine where i would be without
[22:20] his mercy and grace
[22:22] or it was nothing i'd done jesus was the
[22:24] one who brought me
[22:25] to this place once i was lost my soul
[22:29] was certain
[22:29] my heart was empty inside but he saved
[22:32] my soul
[22:33] and he made me whole in everything i
[22:36] find and there's nothing
[22:40] nothing nothing greater than god
[22:43] he feels my need and he wants me every
[22:46] day
[22:46] of my life i've tasted it and see
[22:51] just how good he can be and there's
[22:53] nothing
[22:54] not a one thing nothing greater than god

[22:59] i've tasted and seen just how good it
[23:03] can be
[23:04] and there's nothing nothing not a one
[23:07] thing

[23:44] nothing
[23:45] i don't want me nothing greater than god
[23:50] my lord i've tasted and seen

[23:56] nothing
[23:57] nothing not a one thing no nothing's
[24:02] greater
[24:06] [Music]
[24:14] [Music]
[24:25] if he knows when a
[24:28] robin falls
[24:32] from its nest and he grieves
[24:37] when he ceases to die
[24:44] if he kisses
[24:47] the rose with the morning mist
[24:55] how much more does he
[24:58] love you
[25:05] if he cares for the lilies
[25:14] [Music]
[25:24] if he acknowledges a
[25:28] tree when the wind
[25:32] makes it new how much more
[25:37] does he love me and you
[25:44] if he'll take out the tide
[25:49] and turn the desert
[25:52] from its stride and he'll carve out
[25:57] a river to the sea
[26:04] just to give the little fish
[26:09] one more place he can
[26:13] live how much more
[26:17] does he love you and me
[26:24] oh and if he's made
[26:27] a place for
[26:31] all that has been
[26:34] i've been told
[26:40] that it's true
[26:44] he's preparing
[26:47] a place that i
[26:50] can comprehend
[26:55] how much more does he love me
[27:00] and you
[27:01] [Music]
[27:05] how much more than
[27:11] afraid rose
[27:15] that he gives new life
[27:18] in the spring
[27:24] or does he love me
[27:28] less than the little bird up in its
[27:33] nest that never sows
[27:37] yet it soars on the
[27:40] wind
[27:44] if he can speak just one word
[27:50] to calm the angry winds
[27:54] and peace be still
[27:57] can calm a rolling sea
[28:04] then he can speak peace be
[28:08] still to the storm within
[28:14] that's how much more that he really
[28:20] loves me
[28:41] god bless you all i hope you're
[29:04] god bless you all i hope you're all
[29:06] having a good day today
[29:08] and um i just have a good testimony to
[29:11] share
[29:13] so um some it was
[29:16] november december of last year
[29:18] throughout the whole year i had been
[29:20] suffering with some
[29:22] really bad nervous problems but you know
[29:24] i
[29:26] i am trying to just put that aside you
[29:28] know and
[29:29] so um
[29:33] i think it was around november i had
[29:36] thrown up and
[29:37] there was there was blood and it worried
[29:40] me
[29:40] for a little while and i kind of just
[29:42] tried to put it to the side again i just
[29:44] i didn't want to think dwell too much on
[29:46] it and make it something that it wasn't
[29:49] because sometimes that happened so
[29:52] um as the this year progressed as we
[29:55] started quarantine and
[29:57] you know at the beginning of the year i
[29:58] was having some very bad stomach
[30:02] pains from like right in my
[30:05] top the top of my stomach and i it
[30:08] it actually really hurt and
[30:12] i kind of just tried to ignore it
[30:15] um and then during quarantine it got
[30:18] really bad it was um
[30:22] i thought it was heartburn so i kind of
[30:24] just i tried to
[30:26] eat better or try to eat less so that it
[30:30] doesn't affect
[30:31] my stomach as much and
[30:35] that didn't seem to work the pains they
[30:38] still continued on and
[30:40] um so i just
[30:43] after a while i kind of had enough of
[30:46] keeping it to myself and i went and told
[30:48] my dad
[30:50] and i told him about the pain that i was
[30:53] having and
[30:56] he told me that he had something similar
[30:59] a while back and that it was all stress
[31:02] related
[31:04] and he said that if i continued worrying
[31:07] about things that i had no control over
[31:09] that
[31:10] it could get worse but of course um
[31:13] i'm very grateful for the dad that god
[31:16] has given me and
[31:17] he told me that i just need to place
[31:19] everything in god's hands and so that's
[31:22] that's what i did i prayed and i told
[31:24] god to
[31:25] take control of the situation because
[31:31] because it was really scary because it
[31:33] did hurt it hurt a lot
[31:36] and um but when the pains would come i
[31:38] just tried to fight it off and
[31:41] i tried to claim the blood of jesus on
[31:43] my on
[31:44] my sickness that i had and um
[31:47] so it was last wednesday and i was
[31:50] sitting there and
[31:51] um i was really blessed by the message
[31:54] that
[31:55] um brother the ego brought forth and so
[31:58] i was
[31:59] sitting there and i asked god at the end
[32:01] of his message i just
[32:03] felt my head and i said please don't
[32:05] forget me
[32:08] because i know that there's so many
[32:10] people that are dealing with much worse
[32:12] than stomach ulcers and
[32:14] i just i asked god but please don't
[32:17] forget me because i
[32:18] i can't live like this anymore
[32:23] the pain was really bad especially
[32:25] during the service i got super
[32:27] light-headed and nauseous and
[32:31] i just asked god not to forget about me
[32:35] and so um brother diego at the end of
[32:38] his sermon
[32:39] he began to discern some people some but
[32:42] what they were suffering with he
[32:44] um said someone had back problems and
[32:47] someone was
[32:47] having problems with their feet and when
[32:50] he
[32:51] finished with those i was and i was
[32:53] content and i said lord that's okay
[32:56] um i trust that you have a will for me
[33:01] and i believe that i am healed for jesus
[33:05] but just please don't forget about me
[33:09] and
[33:12] now when i put my head down for the
[33:14] diego said
[33:15] and someone's um suffering with
[33:19] and he paused and my heart dropped i
[33:21] said lord please don't forget about me
[33:26] um he said someone's suffering with a
[33:28] stomach problem
[33:32] and he said it's uh it starts right here
[33:35] and it travels up
[33:38] he said that it's a it's an ulcer
[33:44] it was at that moment that i knew that
[33:49] that was for me
[33:52] and i'm so grateful to god because i
[33:54] know that there are so many people that
[33:56] struggle with so many different things
[34:00] but that you would consider me
[34:04] it really blessed me
[34:08] i just want to thank the lord for the
[34:09] ministry that we have here
[34:11] and i want to thank him for my healing
[34:16] and i pray that this testimony can
[34:20] live the faith of someone
[34:24] god doesn't forget about his children
[34:30] i'm really grateful and i have been
[34:33] doing
[34:34] great i haven't had any stomach problems
[34:37] or anything i have been
[34:38] wonderful so i just want to thank
[34:41] god for everything that he's done for me
[34:44] and for
[34:45] reminding me that i am his child so

[39:12] it is the third part of the seventh day
[39:16] with the subtitle the earthquake
[39:23] and to right away let's go to
[39:26] to our scripture revelation 6 12.
[39:39] and i beheld when he had opened the
[39:41] sixth seal
[39:44] and though there was a great earthquake
[39:46] and the sun became black as sac cloth
[39:49] hair and the moon became his blood
[40:10] we'll see right here in the first verse
[40:12] of chapter six
[40:17] we see seven major things
[40:21] number one la primera
[41:04] lugares
[41:10] right away here we see the interruption
[41:14] of nature immediately the interruption
[41:29] unto jesus oh

[43:23] hearts are falling for fears
[43:39] the insanity of humanity

[45:32] the master was cursed and nature filmed
[45:39] because our inheritance is travailing
[45:56] notice here put me on the screen the
[45:59] punctuation
[46:03] i notice all these little things
[46:08] and sister lana if if you're hearing me
[46:13] you used to be one of my top students in
[46:16] english
[46:20] notice the punctuation observing
[46:25] when he opened the sixth hill
[46:31] there was a great earthquake
[46:35] semi-colon in revelation 6
[46:39] 9 an apocalypse
[46:54] the punctuation
[47:05] forgive me
[47:11] a great earthquake semicolon
[47:17] these things were put there for a
[47:19] purpose
[47:22] so this morning let me give you an
[47:25] english
[47:25] lesson
[47:30] a period only ends a
[47:36] sentence
[47:51] it is used before an extended
[47:53] explanation
[47:57] but notice here after the earthquake it
[48:00] has
[48:01] a period over a comma observatory
[48:16] indicating a degree of separation
[48:20] in the condon gravo de separation and
[48:22] it's greater than that
[48:24] marked by a comma yes
[48:28] and it separates units
[48:32] that contain elements except
[48:35] by commas elements
[48:38] so here is the delicate and dangerous
[48:41] part what earthquake
[48:45] open the sixth seal get
[49:11] there's many earthquakes all over the
[49:14] world
[49:27] is becoming thinner and thinner all the

[57:23] everywhere in the world there is an
[57:26] unsettled peace
[57:31] the whole world seems to be shaken
[57:36] can you imagine tommy he said that in
[57:39] 1955
[57:44] what william what would he say he was
[57:47] mine there was the eye
[57:50] of an eagle looking way into the future
[58:20] i'm not here for that
[58:23] i'm here to show you a way to keep you
[58:26] from being scared
[58:32] not to scare you
[59:11] say matthew matteo
[59:15] i didn't want to bring this bible
[59:16] because it's new and the pages stick
[59:19] but my old one is a bell scarf veteran
[59:22] the pages are falling
[59:23] here we go about the ninth hour
[59:27] jesus cried with a loud voice saying
[59:30] ellie
[59:33] that is to say my god my god why he's
[59:37] not forsaking me
[59:50] some of them that stood there when they
[59:52] heard that said
[59:53] this man called us for elias
[59:57] de los
[1:00:09] jesus when he had cried again with a
[1:00:11] loud voice yelled at the
[1:00:18] and behold the veil of the temple was
[1:00:21] ran in twain
[1:00:22] from the top to the bottom and the earth
[1:00:24] did quake
[1:00:26] and the rocks
[1:00:35] and the grays were open and many bodies
[1:00:38] of the saints which left
[1:00:39] a rose
[1:00:46] and came out of the grace after his
[1:00:48] resurrection
[1:00:49] and went into the holy city and appeared
[1:00:51] unto many
[1:00:54] islands
[1:01:09] in the end of the sabbath as he
[1:01:12] began to dawn toward the first day of
[1:01:15] the week
[1:01:16] came mary magdalene and the other
[1:01:18] married to see the sepulchre
[1:01:32] did he resurrect on the jewish saturday
[1:01:35] or
[1:01:35] our sunday
[1:02:03] give me the screen
[1:02:09] here we go
[1:02:13] an interval between two servers
[1:02:56] you know what i'm talking about
[1:03:13] when the angel came and took the stone
[1:03:16] away
[1:03:19] i just william i just love the words
[1:03:24] oh and lorena i'm still wearing for my
[1:03:27] bavero pokemon
[1:03:39] let's go a little further
[1:03:48] we got that okay at the end of the
[1:03:50] sabbath
[1:03:52] notice the scripture how it reads
[1:03:55] at the end of the service
[1:04:39] tord means significance so let
[1:04:43] me let me tell you right now
[1:04:47] why do they call it good friday
[1:04:52] jesus was never on the cross and the
[1:04:54] friday
[1:04:57] night it is impossible for him to have
[1:05:00] been on the cross on the friday
[1:05:04] i will not let my holy one
[1:05:22] temple and i'll build it again in three
[1:05:24] days
[1:05:33] for three days three nights oh
[1:05:37] must the solomon be also for three days
[1:05:46] he died on the cross at three o'clock in
[1:05:49] the evening
[1:05:52] and i'm not gonna do all the math you
[1:05:54] people have homework
[1:05:56] 200 and you do your homework
[1:06:00] don't expect me and the festering the
[1:06:02] minister's
[1:06:15] and by the time they took him down yeah
[1:06:19] and by the time they took him to the
[1:06:21] tomb
[1:06:23] i am presuming that he was about five
[1:06:27] o'clock in the evening
[1:06:29] so you do five o'clock friday
[1:06:34] five o'clock saturday
[1:06:38] how many hours twenty-four right
[1:06:41] right and then from there
[1:07:01] the first day of the week comes mary
[1:07:04] magdalene
[1:07:05] early when it was yet dark
[1:07:08] it was pointing to it was pointing to
[1:07:11] dawn
[1:07:12] towards the first day unto the saponkar
[1:07:16] and see the stone taken away from the
[1:07:18] sepulcher
[1:07:21] notice observing so
[1:07:24] let's let's add maybe 12 more hours
[1:07:29] and that's 36 hours burning on sunday
[1:07:35] so there is no way that he was on the
[1:07:38] cross
[1:07:38] on friday
[1:07:45] he was on the cross either wednesday or
[1:07:47] thursday
[1:07:48] it depends if you go to the jewish
[1:07:51] sabbath
[1:07:52] or to the gentile sunday
[1:08:08] little further
[1:08:14] because their day started six o'clock in
[1:08:17] the morning
[1:08:20] saying matthew 28 2.
[1:08:25] and behold there was a great earthquake
[1:08:28] for the angel of the lord descended from
[1:08:31] heaven
[1:08:32] and came and rolled back the stone from
[1:08:34] the door and set
[1:08:36] upon it
[1:08:53] when did the angel of the lord descend
[1:08:56] from heaven
[1:09:01] i've told you so many times from behind
[1:09:03] this pulpit
[1:09:17] when did the angel of the lord descend
[1:09:19] from heaven
[1:09:23] follow me closely here
[1:09:28] the first time his voice shook the world
[1:09:31] the primera is
[1:09:37] [Music]
[1:09:58] he was lifted into a constellation
[1:10:02] of angels
[1:10:05] in the shape of a pyramid in the form of
[1:10:08] a pyramid
[1:10:09] and it formed the face of our lord jesus
[1:10:12] christ and when the angel
[1:10:16] came down from heaven he was on the
[1:10:20] cloud
[1:10:21] he came down from heaven
[1:10:27] told him go back to jeffersonville
[1:10:33] move the stone
[1:10:37] remove the stones
[1:10:42] observing
[1:10:56] the second bible
[1:11:11] had to remove the stones
[1:11:15] because they had crucified the
[1:11:18] word they had crucified it
[1:11:38] observing
[1:11:51] in the shape of a pyramid in a form of a
[1:11:55] pyramid
[1:11:55] and you hit a crowbar
[1:12:01] he said observing
[1:12:05] it was remember i said that this was a
[1:12:07] physical resurrection
[1:12:13] hallelujah hallelujah what i'm trying to
[1:12:17] do
[1:12:19] this morning like paul
[1:12:22] told the ephesians to the saints
[1:12:27] where they are in ephesus
[1:12:30] i said to the saints there are in las
[1:12:32] cruces
[1:12:34] questions
[1:12:41] he said blessed be the god and father of
[1:12:45] our lord jesus christ
[1:12:50] who has blessed us with all spiritual
[1:12:53] blessings
[1:12:54] in heavenly places
[1:12:59] this message is
[1:13:28] i like good all shouting
[1:14:23] i want to put your feet up in the
[1:15:07] those things are put their tummy
[1:15:11] i'm not telling you something you don't
[1:15:13] know
[1:15:15] you're sharp more sharper than me
[1:15:20] he god that says i looked it looked like
[1:15:23] a crowbar
[1:15:28] how come it wasn't a bar of a
[1:15:32] robin or a bar of a raccoon a
[1:15:36] crowbar
[1:15:57] and now he needed us the crows are the
[1:16:00] ones
[1:16:01] that are keeping the voice of elijah
[1:17:01] and when the seventh angel removed the
[1:17:05] stone
[1:17:10] and he entered into the king's chamber
[1:17:16] and when he entered into the king's
[1:17:18] chamber
[1:17:20] he received the sword
[1:17:24] he's received the soul especially the
[1:17:28] sword of the king this right here to go
[1:17:30] to the king's chamber
[1:17:32] [Music]
[1:17:32] [Applause]
[1:17:40] there was uh when he removed the stone
[1:17:44] it was a white stone
[1:17:45] it was a granite stone
[1:17:52] look at what is granted
[1:17:56] it's a grain
[1:18:03] it's an ingenious stone it's a nature of
[1:18:10] fire
[1:18:12] and that granite yes granito that was in
[1:18:15] the king's chamber
[1:18:19] it came from mount sinai
[1:18:23] it came from mount sinai del monte
[1:18:29] where moses received the law
[1:18:33] the commandments of this angel
[1:18:37] yes i was with moses i will be with you
[1:18:44] he had to receive the law for us
[1:18:51] observing the
[1:18:54] sun had never shined on that stone
[1:19:00] it was in tune
[1:19:03] but when he opened the six seals
[1:19:21] was the only coastal city that jesus
[1:19:24] ever visited
[1:19:29] if the mighty works had been done on you
[1:19:34] know
[1:20:02] 70 years ago
[1:20:06] and he said there is a crack starting in
[1:20:08] alaska
[1:20:11] in alaska through the aleutian islands
[1:20:16] 200 miles into the sea
[1:20:21] and it comes back to san diego
[1:20:24] to los angeles
[1:21:12] in the beginning we find that satan was
[1:21:14] so beautiful to his deceived angels
[1:21:17] and he was the most beautiful angel of
[1:21:19] all of them
[1:21:20] sure it lays in the devil
[1:21:33] [Music]
[1:21:39] king satan's son
[1:21:42] thought that god accepted beauty and
[1:21:45] he thought that bringing in an altar and
[1:21:47] making it real pretty
[1:21:48] for worship that's what god would
[1:21:50] respect they say think the same thing
[1:21:52] today
[1:21:53] so if god disrespects worship sincerity
[1:21:57] sacrifice came with justice just as abel
[1:22:01] but it was by revelation that he
[1:22:03] understood
[1:22:04] that it was not apples and his parentsy
[1:22:08] did you know the fall came by women at
[1:22:10] the beginning and fall
[1:22:12] the end is going to wind up the same way
[1:22:15] women coming into authority and ruling
[1:22:17] over man and so forth
[1:22:18] you know the scripture says that you
[1:22:21] know the day that she puts on man's
[1:22:23] clothes and bobs her hair
[1:22:25] all those things are contrary to god's
[1:22:27] word
[1:22:28] you know she represents the church when
[1:22:31] you watch what
[1:22:32] women are doing you'll see what the
[1:22:33] church is doing
[1:22:35] that's exactly right the old horror and
[1:22:39] daughters of revelation
[1:22:40] 17 given to the poor blind
[1:22:43] miserable people heard doctrine of
[1:22:46] theology contrary to the word of god
[1:22:48] and they found there the souls of slaves
[1:22:51] and men and women
[1:22:52] of everywhere instead of attracting the
[1:22:55] people
[1:22:55] christ vindicates his word which
[1:22:58] attracts the people
[1:22:59] you don't attract the people of churches
[1:23:01] that are attracted by big denominations
[1:23:03] and big
[1:23:03] uh doings and great big carry-ons and
[1:23:06] fancy things but the word of god
[1:23:07] attracts the bride of christ
[1:23:11] now notice it's interesting
[1:23:15] to notice how that that the church tries
[1:23:17] to attract the attention of the people
[1:23:19] by
[1:23:19] buying robes and dress choirs bob
[1:23:21] there's women and painted faces
[1:23:23] they think it's a sign like an angel lie
[1:23:26] like a devil
[1:23:27] run around all night to dance like say
[1:23:30] nothing about it
[1:23:31] and that's what they think is all right
[1:23:33] that's beautiful but you see
[1:23:35] that's false made that's not the word of
[1:23:38] god
[1:23:39] while the true bride attracts
[1:23:43] the attention of god by keeping his word
[1:23:46] now notice now let us notice christ
[1:23:50] he say when i wait a minute what about
[1:23:52] this beauty you're talking about
[1:23:54] the bible said in isaiah 53 2
[1:23:58] that when jesus come there was no beauty
[1:24:01] of him that we should desire
[1:24:03] is that right there's no beauty if he
[1:24:06] would have come in the worldly beauty as
[1:24:08] satan is today the people would have run
[1:24:09] around him and accept him the way they
[1:24:11] knew the church today
[1:24:14] they would have believed him receiving
[1:24:16] as they do satan today
[1:24:18] certainly they would but he didn't come
[1:24:19] in that kind of a beauty
[1:24:21] but he always comes in the beauty of
[1:24:24] character
[1:24:25] the christ wasn't a beautiful great
[1:24:27] strong stout man
[1:24:30] god doesn't choose that kind stop just a
[1:24:33] minute man
[1:24:35] look at your your creeds that you serve
[1:24:39] look in your churches
[1:24:42] is it just exactly with the word of god
[1:24:45] have you met every qualification say
[1:24:47] i'm a good man so was nicodemus and so
[1:24:49] is all the rest
[1:24:50] they were fine see that don't have
[1:24:51] nothing to do with it
[1:24:54] and women i want you to look in the
[1:24:56] mirror
[1:24:59] and look what god requires a woman to do
[1:25:04] and see in god's mirror not your church
[1:25:08] in god's mirror and see if you could
[1:25:11] qualify in your life
[1:25:12] the spiritual bride of jesus christ
[1:25:16] ministers think the same do you cut
[1:25:18] corners here to save somebody's feelings
[1:25:20] over honor
[1:25:21] would you do this if it wasn't if they
[1:25:23] put you out of the church
[1:25:25] if you are feeling that way my dear
[1:25:27] brother let me warn you in the name of
[1:25:30] jesus christ flee from that right now
[1:25:33] and lady if you can't measure up to the
[1:25:36] qualification of a christian
[1:25:38] not as a nominal christian but in your
[1:25:41] heart
[1:25:42] and your life is patterned exactly like
[1:25:45] god's marriage certificate here says it
[1:25:48] has to be
[1:25:49] and church member if your church isn't
[1:25:52] like that
[1:25:53] can measure up to god's qualification of
[1:25:55] his word
[1:25:56] [Music]
[1:25:57] get out of it and get into christ
[1:26:01] that's solemn warning we don't know what
[1:26:04] time

[1:29:56] declare to you
[1:29:57] everything that god has told me to say
[1:29:59] and i've said it in the name of the lord
[1:30:11] [Music]
[1:30:18] it doesn't make believers of people
[1:30:21] nothing will you know it's exactly thus
[1:30:25] saith the lord amen
[1:30:29] amen zechariah 14.
[1:30:38] and his feet shall stand in that day
[1:30:40] upon the mount of olives
[1:30:42] which is before jerusalem on the east
[1:30:45] and the mount of olives shall cleave in
[1:30:46] the midst
[1:30:47] thereof toward the east and toward the
[1:30:50] west and there shall be a very great
[1:30:52] valiant and half of the mountain shall
[1:30:55] move toward the north and half toward
[1:30:57] the south
[1:30:58] yes
[1:31:25] and you shall flee to the valley of the
[1:31:27] mountains for the valley of the mountain
[1:31:29] shall reach unto israel yea
[1:31:31] ye shall flee like as you fled from
[1:31:34] before the earthquake
[1:31:36] in the days of uzziah king of judah and
[1:31:39] the lord my
[1:31:40] god shall come and know the saints with
[1:31:42] thee
[1:32:01] and it shall be in the day that living

[1:32:06] half of them to the former sea and have
[1:32:09] toward the hindu sea
[1:32:11] in summer and in winter shall it be
[1:32:16] aguas
[1:32:24] here is where we turn the corner to
[1:32:26] finish
[1:32:29] we see another earthquake splitting open
[1:32:31] the earth
[1:32:35] split in the mount of olives
[1:32:53] and there were voices and thunders and
[1:32:55] lightnings and there was a great
[1:32:57] earthquake such as was not since men
[1:33:00] were upon the earth
[1:33:02] so mighty an earthquake and so great
[1:33:06] entonces
[1:33:19] and the great city was divided into
[1:33:21] three parts and the cities of the
[1:33:23] nations
[1:33:24] fell and great babylon came in
[1:33:27] remembrance before god to give unto her
[1:33:29] the cup of the wine of the furnace of
[1:33:32] his wrath
[1:33:47] and every island fled away and the
[1:33:49] mountains were not found
[1:33:55] in march in may 11th of this year
[1:34:00] an earthquake remotely
[1:34:27] and they send a crown corona virus
[1:34:58] and it runs east to west
[1:35:03] in the southern part of the mountain
[1:35:08] it is the most important cemetery there
[1:35:12] is
[1:35:20] that's where all the important people
[1:35:22] are buried
[1:35:26] is
[1:35:29] but on the top of the mount of
[1:35:32] olives is the most
[1:35:36] important cemetery in
[1:35:41] it jerusalem over a hundred and fifty
[1:35:44] thousand graves there
[1:35:50] it has been used for over three thousand
[1:35:53] years
[1:35:54] millennials
[1:36:08] who was jesus talking to the aquila
[1:36:12] jesus he said if you have the faith of a
[1:36:15] mustard seed
[1:36:19] and you have faith you can
[1:37:03] it grows to be the biggest plant in the
[1:37:06] garden
[1:37:09] and what is the most important thing of
[1:37:12] the mustard seed
[1:37:16] they it makes they extract oil from
[1:37:20] it they all oil
[1:37:23] come from the mustard seed
[1:38:43] sixth seal to open
[1:38:47] moses
[1:38:50] so then this master see
[1:38:54] where did he get his power and
[1:39:10] he
[1:39:20] because that donkey was the one that saw
[1:39:23] that he the donkey was the one that
[1:39:26] saw the one that was gonna help jesus at
[1:39:30] the end time
[1:39:34] well how did that donkey help jesus
[1:40:04] he recognized
[1:40:33] had to grow to be a big white
[1:40:36] horse
[1:40:42] so he had the power
[1:40:46] notice that jesus came to the mount of
[1:40:48] olives
[1:41:02] but no more than 10 minutes you pesky
[1:41:06] let me finish

[1:41:21] when they therefore were come together
[1:41:23] they asked of him
[1:41:24] saying lord will thou at this time
[1:41:27] restore again the kingdom to israel
[1:41:37] and he said unto them it is not for you
[1:41:39] to know the times or the season
[1:41:41] which the father has put in his own
[1:41:44] power
[1:41:53] and we had spoken these things while
[1:41:55] they beheld
[1:41:56] he was taken up and a cloud received him
[1:41:59] out of their sight
[1:42:10] and while they looked steadfly toward
[1:42:12] heaven as he went up
[1:42:13] behold two men stood by them in white
[1:42:17] apparel
[1:42:26] who were these two men that saw him
[1:42:28] ascend
[1:42:32] it's the two man that will be

[1:45:56] rosetta
[1:46:09] he said on the mount of olives they will
[1:46:11] recognize him
[1:46:15] in the message
[1:46:20] he said
[1:46:20] [Music]
[1:46:23] if i could gather about one
[1:46:26] half million around the mount of olives
[1:46:34] [Music]
[1:46:35] in an outdoor meeting on the
[1:46:38] of allied that's the prophet talking
[1:46:41] okay prophet orlando
[1:46:43] and tell him to read what it says in the
[1:46:46] new testament
[1:46:51] what the messiah was
[1:46:54] and if he does not repeat the same thing
[1:46:58] that when he was here
[1:47:02] then i'm a false prophet
[1:47:20] observing remember
[1:47:23] recording there's a lot of
[1:47:27] there's the cemetery to the south
[1:47:31] cemetery and the top of mount valles
[1:47:34] or more than a hundred and fifty
[1:47:37] thousand graves
[1:47:44] you know in the kidron valley
[1:47:48] in esteban
[1:48:16] in 1964 observant
[1:48:20] king hussein of jordan
[1:48:24] was gonna build the intercontinental
[1:48:27] hotel on top of the mount of alice
[1:48:46] directly east of the temple mount
[1:48:52] so they relocated the site to the south
[1:48:58] and in order to make the hotel
[1:49:02] they desecrated hundreds hundreds of
[1:49:05] graves
[1:49:06] on top of the mount of olives
[1:49:12] then the arabs came
[1:49:15] and desecrated the tombs yes
[1:49:19] that many of the bones and just threw
[1:49:21] them all over
[1:49:24] and used the tombs for toilets
[1:49:41] were buried in burial caves
[1:49:45] around the mountain
[1:49:51] full of dead people all over
[1:50:09] and i'm going to read it only in english
[1:50:11] to say and i'll finish with this
[1:50:14] the hand of the lord was now this in the
[1:50:17] valley
[1:50:18] the hand of the lord was upon me and
[1:50:20] carried me out
[1:50:21] in the spirit of the lord and set me
[1:50:24] down in the midst of the valley which
[1:50:26] was
[1:50:26] full of bones
[1:50:30] and caused me to pass them round about
[1:50:33] and because there were very many in the
[1:50:36] open valley
[1:50:37] and they were very dry
[1:50:40] and he said unto me son of man can these
[1:50:43] bones live
[1:50:45] and i answered oh lord god thou knowest
[1:50:49] again he said unto me prophesy from
[1:50:52] these bones
[1:50:53] and say unto them oh ye dry bones hear
[1:50:57] the word of the lord
[1:50:59] thus says the lord god unto these bones
[1:51:02] behold
[1:51:03] i will cause breath to enter into you he
[1:51:06] had the oil
[1:51:08] i will call breath to come into you and
[1:51:10] you
[1:51:11] shall live and i will lay stinus upon
[1:51:14] you
[1:51:15] and will bring up flesh upon you and
[1:51:18] cover you with skin
[1:51:19] and put breath in you and you shall live
[1:51:22] and you shall know that i am the lord
[1:51:26] mother else says on top of the mouth
[1:51:28] they
[1:51:29] recognize who he was hallelujah
[1:51:33] so i prophesied as i was commanded and
[1:51:36] as i prophesied there was a noise
[1:51:38] and behold a shaking in an earthquake
[1:51:41] and the bones
[1:51:42] came together bone took his bone
[1:51:47] and when i beheld all the sinews and the
[1:51:50] flesh came upon them
[1:51:52] and the skin covered them above but
[1:51:54] there was no breath in them
[1:51:57] then said he unto me prophesy unto the
[1:52:00] wind
[1:52:00] prophesy solomon and say to the wind
[1:52:03] thus says our god come from the four
[1:52:06] winds of
[1:52:07] breath and breathe upon this lane that
[1:52:10] they may live
[1:52:13] so i prophesied as he commanded me and
[1:52:16] the
[1:52:16] breath came into them and they lived and
[1:52:19] stood up upon their feet
[1:52:20] an exceeding great army
[1:52:24] then he said unto me son of man these
[1:52:26] bones
[1:52:27] are the whole house of israel behold
[1:52:30] they say our bones are dry
[1:52:32] and our hope is lost we are cut
[1:52:35] off for our parts then the areas cut
[1:52:39] them in pieces and threw them away
[1:52:42] therefore prophesy and say unto them
[1:52:44] thus saith the lord god
[1:52:46] behold all my people i will open your
[1:52:49] graves
[1:52:49] and cause you to come up out of your
[1:52:51] graves and

[1:53:03] out of your graves and shall put my
[1:53:06] spirit in you
[1:53:07] and you shall live and i shall place you
