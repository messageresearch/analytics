what to give to the bride and make the lord lovely god bless you pastor khalid very true possible my life has changed really i thank god that the time i i first i first visited the church during my instance on my augustine really the turn up was was wow that people liked where to seed and and it forced me to divide the church into two parts that is first first service and second service surely i literally thank you that at last i have got what i wanted may you continue sending the message to me and on top of that i want to ask i want to say thank you for what you supported us with food because some children would be dying but really god made the lovely god made the wonderful god bless you bless all day all the saints who have been supporting us may the lovely god be with you i don't have much to say but really as a man of god who is following the uh the prophet his message and who is the bride waiting for the rapture to come maybe let that god bless you amen message of the hour has been brought to us by brother william marion branham omega william the scripture references are malachi 4 5 and 6. behold i will send you elijah the prophet before the coming of the great and dreadful day of the lord and he shall turn the heart of the fathers to the children in the heart of the children to their fathers lest i come and smite the earth with a curse [Music] i'm surrounded [Music] i'm surrounded by amen amen would you stand to your feet this opponent thankful to god for what he has provided what he has done thank each and every one of you for your help and your support in all this work that the lord has placed on on us for us to do yesterday god bless you now as we get into the word how many have been excited to get into the word always have a good time right getting into the word so now i see where what time it is and then let's let's let's go and see as far as long as the holy spirit would lead us to go and uh once again it's uh the parallel number 24. and with the subtitle the perfect match and you tell your neighbor that the perfect match amen perfect match amen isaiah 28 verse 8 and then verse when you have it you can say amen and it reads like this for all the tables are full of vomit and filthiness so that there is no place clean or precept must must be upon precept should be not maybe no precept must be upon precept here a little and they're a little the whole nation is on pins and needles yes or yes coc yeah everywhere you turn around not only with the rising number of cases of this virus but waiting to see who will be elected and determining who's elected i do i can say i predict one thing who's going to win queen bagan no no we already know who who who who has won already yes i am but i do predict this recipe one thing's for sure half the country will be partying the next day because they're candidate one and the other half will be mad as heck trying to figure out how to throw the winner out of house lines will be formed for voting as lines have been have been drawn in the sand and each one taking their sides and as we look at this even though each person may not be in total agreement with their candidate they chose the one that they feel stands for the closest to the way that they think i'm going to say it again they choose the one that is the closest to the way that they think it is the one that they feel is the closest match to them the one that is the closest to their own ideologies that's who they vote for we hear things like our country's future is on the line or this country is about to be changed forever my question is where have they been we have had a prophet that has foretold this years ago but they rejected the message and by doing so they rejected the holy ghost but today there is a people when we voted for jesus you see there's a big difference in why we voted for jesus we didn't vote because his word or his teachings was the closest to our ideologies or our thinking no that's not why we voted for jesus but we voted because his word his thoughts his thinking is superior to ours we voted for him because that is the mind we want to put on it was never about what i think and how close we can get to what god's word says it's about the perfect match it's about because the word never came out of us this morning we came out of the word in the beginning was the word the word was with god the word was god and the word became flesh and dwelt amongst it we are what came forth from that great logo therefore when we find our way by the grace of god we have found [Music] we needed a guide we needed a leader a leader we needed a teacher we needed a comforter we needed a priest and he was the answer and is the answer to all our needs say it again he has never made a promise that he cannot and will not keep completely that's why brother branham says what is this when god heals he doesn't heal to show his power hey man he is perfect and his word is true as human beings we we need to know that we belong somewhere come on every morning because i found the part that was missing here as we get into this word and find we're looking at as we talk about the perfect match it might get a little rough okay but but but look at what i'm trying to what the holy spirit is trying to accomplish you might say well brother i don't see that or i don't agree with that that's okay he says but know that what i'm telling you is the truth the rest is up to you would you turn in your bibles now once again to philippians the fourth chapter and the 19th verse forgive me but i'm a little bit struggling this morning up here i finally uncle on i finally went to the next step of my life i didn't want to go bifocals so i went to progressives if we let this progress because they don't have lines i can't see worth a darn so i'm got these glasses on and penguins are okay but if i raise my head too much but they're good to read though so pray for me this morning looking out there and the ground is going like this i don't know if i should have worn these or not but i got to get used to them amen philippians 4 19 reads like this but my god shall supply all your need according to his riches in glory by christ jesus in gloria and christoph jesus how many times have we read this is esto many many times i have read it many times how many times have we sang this okay can you sing along with me this morning but right now how many can sing with me my god shall supply all my can you can you stop and sing it again my god shells according to his riches in glory and i i want you to i want to stop there how many are needy today see if i were to ask you to write down all your needs necessity how many needs do you think you might have quantized answers to yourself and are all your needs are they all needs think about it how many really how many needs do you really have maybe you can list your needs and by the end of the week maybe some of those needs might have been answered but at the beginning of next week you'll have another list of needs and yes physically we we do there are things that we do need we need air we need water next time we need food we need all those things to survive we even need companionship there are many people that even die of loneliness so we pray lord i need this and i need that neces but you ever come to a place where you feel like it's a lot of it is just vain repetition i don't know am i talking to us it seems like we pray the same prayer i think we're all guilty in one form or another and we pray and we pray about the same thing lord i need this and lord i need that after a while you wonder if the lord really hears those vain repetitions especially matthew chapter 6 hold on to that to what i just read back to that philippians but when you pray this is verse seven per society and when you pray use not vain repetitions how many here use vain repetition okay we got a few people that are that are honest don't use vain repetition as the heathen do for they think that they shall be heard for their much speaking como los gentiles que pies ye therefore like unto them for your father knoweth what things you have need of before you even ask of him what is okay how many have a need for food you need to how many have need water everybody has these needs right now verse 31 tells us though therefore take no thought okay we repeat prayers over and over lord i need this and lord i need that and lord i need it and the bible is telling us don't even take a thought about it why do we think so much about that why do we pray so much about those things take no thought saying what shall we eat or what shall we drink or where will shall we be clothed take no thought about it no penn says i want everybody to repeat after me this morning take no thought take note that that means don't think about it right it's so easy just to say it and don't think about it after all these things do the gentiles seek for your heavenly father knoweth that ye have need of all these things but the answer comes when he says but seek ye first the kingdom of god and his righteousness and all these things shall be added unto you therefore take no thought for the moral for the morrow shall take thought for the things of itself so the holy spirit comes to be back again and he tells me this read philippians once again i go back and it says but my god and then he says stop he says [Music] watch the messenger of the first church age [Music] because they didn't know who that god was but he says my god watch how important that is he's declaring unto him to them who this unknown god is now with that in mind he's declaring it and when he is declared unto you you know that god that is shall supply i like this now my god shall supply all your need i want you to stop here for a moment because we're notice what the scripture says that's the need to know where we were connected from the beginning the need to be connected the need to find our perfect match we cannot function our god is the fountain of all that we have need of no estradiol jesus christ is saying speak first the kingdom of god and his righteousness and all these other things will be added to you why because when you find him and now you can tell somebody else shall supply i think it goes very well with what we're speaking about this morning when god wanted to create fishes somebody help me out they're going to play i'm going to create who is he going to talk to who's he going to speak to him he spoke to the waters yes sir yes don't know maybe you're not with me this is i'm going to say it again god wanted to create fish so where did he or who did he speak to or what did he speak to look at the bible says that he spoke to the waters and he said let the waters amen yes or yes coc when god wanted to create trees what did he speak to aquila blonde but when god wanted to create man he spoke to himself and what was therefore if you take the fish out of the water it dies yes sir yes coc the earth then has everything that the tree would ever need and if you take the tree out of the earth what happens to the tree the tree dies that's right so it is with man god has everything that the man needs to live and when man disconnects himself from god he also will die so remember though that the water without the fish continues being water continuous but the fish without the water is nothing the earth without the tree continues being the earth but the tree without the earth is it's about finding the side from where you were formed or taken from here a little and they're a little aki toyo for with stammering lips and another tongue will he speak to this people i want you to notice this now upon line lineage precept upon precepts it's a recipe here this morning it's a recipe and after he says line must be upon line and precept upon precepts he says this is the rest it's that simple this is the rest if you don't have rest in your life you know somewhere line is not upon line linea somewhere precept is not upon precept and he's telling us this is the rest wherewith ye may cause the weary to rest and line upon line illinois this is refrigerator i feel so dry mesenter i don't feel refreshed at all is not upon line we're getting into this this morning how many are following me this morning or your life parallels perfectly esteem parallel perfect with the line of the word the word that you were taken from es la palabra tomato this is the reason that many are not at rest est and they leave out the parts that are too hard hearts they don't want to live mine is not upon line there is no rest there is no refreshing no i refrigerator now what notice how how the scripture then reads commodities must be upon precept the precept is the commandment law must be upon law lay there must be upon commandment and line is it's used for measuring the bible says it's a chord or a string the precept once again is the law or commandment and that was israel's rest of israel how many know that got to know these things once again that was israel's rest gave them the law and in that law they this yeah did it according to what the law had said they found rest there for their soul and control but the line then precept must be upon priesthood and that line it does something that nothing else could do in yeah it magnifies the law magnifica now watch he is the same yesterday today and forever the full revelation of god god ever was shall be guilty of death they said i've never committed adultery and then he says magnify it magnification now if you look at a woman to lust after her sistem you've already committed adultery watch he never took away the law because precept must be upon priests but what he did he magnified it now he's saying okay you say that's the old testament but it's a parallel within you doesn't do away with you magnifies the word that was in seed form and now it brings it to its manifestation manifestation watch this how many are with me remember the sabbath day keep it holy why many people think that they speak in tongues they got the holy ghost that don't mean that yes the holy ghost does and will cause some to speak in tongues but until looks back there and doesn't agree with the rest of the words then it's a wrong spirit somewhere it's got to come from the inside which is the word from the you started back there as a seed say it again you started back there as a seed that's why we read it last time says how is that possible how can you disagree with any part of it and claim to be part of the word that is the rest the refreshing refrigerator that's the third rest but he helped me out on this sunday school morning what the first rest was there was three major arrests in the bible right the first one god that's right on the seventh day what did he do the second rest what nobody i just said it a while ago a penalty but many people don't understand because they want to make christ is the anointed word of the hour i want this to to really hit home where we rest upon the full word of god when i read line upon line i i i think about two lines two lines those lineas and uh two lines run in parallel i see what i think of i don't know you a lot of things to think of i also think of a book and each sentence is a line together line upon line they tell a story and as they tell a story the more the books developed we'll get into that in a moment now notice this now because this is why it's so tremendous brother says in the message unbelief does not hinder god it says in the last days what it's going to take to stand is a scriptural trained church i know everything brother branham says joseph and you should but everything he said proved that the bible was true hello everybody i'm going to say it again everything he said proves that the bible is the word of god that the bible is now we can see we don't want to go off on preaching but but we get excited sometimes that's the only way to stand is a scriptural trained shirt he says on the line and linea for there's going to be incarnal pers impersonations rise in personification we realize that we are in the last days anything can look so real why is that the truth anything can look real nowadays but yet if it's off the scripture leave it alone i don't care who said it i don't care what pastor que pastor i don't care what pulper priest okay or bishop oh cardinal if it's off the scripture you leave it alone watch this now unbelief doesn't destroy god including that no destruction it doesn't destroy his plan no that's true is the plan it doesn't destroy his works no there's three it only destroys the unbeliever now watch as we look and find that perfect match that we're talking about would you put that up there parallel as an adjective parallelo as an adjective just look at all the all those words there is resemble similar estimate to bear resemblance equivalent imitation echo remind record be in harmony with coincide now watch this the word parallel is synonymous then with the word match as we've seen and line must be upon line that's why god matched as we said the fish with the seas he matched the tree with the earth and he matched the man with himself and then he took the woman from the side of the man when they pierce chris had also a body body on earth today is his bride where did he come from he came from his side yes him hey i said bone of his because she's the perfect match with him now watch this now thank you everything was a perfect match everything lined up but when eve got away from the mold i'm going to say it again she got out from behind her head four walls what a condition huh a condition nothing matched not uh it was all it was all in in ruins when we look at this pando mira the reason there's so many problems in the marriage this line is not upon line hello everybody hold on put on your seat belts a little bit we're gonna go for a ride and i see people they just can't make it they can't get it together no please why line is not upon line it doesn't match something's wrong something's off sometimes and when line is not upon line there is no rest or refreshing in that relationship that's the resting place this is that's the place of refreshing precept is upon precept and line is upon us notice in the message he must be born again she puts her print on him this is the word another woman there would marr it forever because they are to be won no other woman should ever fit that that's right you got a wife you belong remember that and i tell this to the young people of the u.s holiness i tell this to everybody everybody seems to so many have a problem with this remember according you've marred the mold from where you're taken from us and when you act like a man you're out of your place and when man begins to get too long seems to fit no matter what okay many are with me this morning come on now it doesn't fit no one can have sometimes we try to force them all force it in the mold it don't work sure there is but he said it's marred forever forever praise god brother i made a lot of mistakes is don't go having relations with that outside of marriage yes sir yes coc these things aren't easy to preach we gotta preach them oh to have to answer to god for not telling you the truth don't admire your mold young people no last time because later on in life you'll find that you don't fit nowhere we'll get that and he will use it again nobody loves you now you know nobody cares for you yeah you look look look at the what what you did look at what happened in your life what ends up happening you grow up and you don't feel like you fit anywhere man that's satan's plan hello everybody you want me to stop i'll stop here watch who's pushing this he's in guinness in the latest in age how fitting the characteristics of this last age last characteristic the forecast of the 20th century one god this love understanding and care for each other and they're striving the catholics and protestants are striving for it now they're gaining ground in is the very attitude that was seen in the united nations organization when the world leaders refused to recognize any one individual concept of spiritual worship but they but they agreed upon or recommended put in all these concepts with hopes that the religions become leveled into one especially was there ever an age like this 20th century now we're the 21st this is the age of the communists what is communism russia oh no no no communism is a spirit and it's an anti-god spirit where all men are supposedly equal in theory this is the age of political parties call themselves christian democrats christians democrats christian socialists christians christian commonwealth federations oh they're coming well and thus we ought to do so today isn't that what they're trying to turn the country too turn it into a socialist country show me any socialist country that has ever flourished according to marx's theory of socialism el socialism is a transitional social state everywhere all those my goodness i want to read this article listen to this article but you think times have been good you ain't seen nothing yet either let's see let's let's pull back the curtain a little bit the u.n says the christian church is the enemy of human rights so that the world is not subject to christian doctrines they cannot impose their spiritual laws in their id 2020 project they say that it is it is it is mandatory to corner christians and divide their beliefs and faith that they cannot win more lives for their christian doctrine they are trying to take away the power from the church because christians they say commit crimes against gender equality by prohibiting their human rights that we are as christians are enemies of humanity under a new world order christians are an obstacle and an opposition to the excellent work of the un for gender ideology you know positions it used to be man and woman now supposedly there are over a hundred gender types now our what's the difference between israel and the gentiles he's in israel israel was blinded that right amen they didn't do it willfully god did it i want you to really get this because this this really hits home the growth of christianity in the world is a threat we must neutralize religious groups for their campaigns against our gender ideology is i'm not going to tell you yes or no but i will tell you this everything you do whether it's eating your food yes drinking a drink or taking shots oh you make sure that you pray about it i will tell you that that's your choice of what you want to do but pray about things don't just take it all the doctor told me i don't take away that prayer through vaccinations there's a lot of things that it says but i want you to i want to get to this the u.n reiterates we will be able to implement abortion implemented neutralize the global growth of humanity global through homosexualism and lesbianism make sure that people understand we don't hate we're not against homosexuals or lesbians god doesn't hate the homosexual or the lesbian but he hates the act of it you know that he loves the soul girls i'm watch this we will vaccinate our children and adolescents so that only ten percent of children are born for an equitable reduction and and 1.5 billion homosexuals homosexuals so that we can prove prevent the birth of five billion children and lead to the death girls we will apply the full weight of humanistic laws no wonder the world is in such a condition nothing matches anymore i'm going to turn the corner now can i have like 10 15 minutes no wonder the world is in such a condition once again nothing matches anymore but we can make sure that we are in line line up with the bible with the scripture teachings instead of man's theology the quicker you'll find the resurrected christ church you're but i will tell he didn't want to line up with god nor with god's prophet sounds like a lot of people today watch this now he could say people say we'll line up with the bible did i miss something somewhere i'll line up with the pastor but not the brother sorry but line is not upon line he's a part of that mystical body of christ that makes him part of the word then how can i deny him because the reason this needs to be taught it is somewhere [Music] the church lining up like la nova traffic mini skirts this is supposed to be the bride of christ ready for the coming of the lord is this the best we could do he said but hello [Music] upon lining brother if your brother's not lined up don't don't line yourself up over here how many are with me this morning line up with each other havelando de pablo don't be ignorant of this mystery in other words this is a parallel mystery there's a match to it to this watch this now brother caleb don't save nobody we have one savior that's jesus christ yet a little while in the world we'll see me no more does your life and your profession match the profession you claim to be christians look at the way they live the arrow of god's deliverance he said i want my experience to match god's bible that's the match in time if you want that's good stuff brother brown says will paul have to give an account for his people yeah see praise god because i preached what paul preached what is it church yes it's the mystical body of christ being formed for line upon lines who put the first line of faith [Applause] come on church and then it came the next one you know we don't have to eat and the next one is a line line one line one line until a word bride has been formed waiting for watch esperanto oh let your experience match poles [Music] the power of the holy ghost begins to move again i want to skip some of these things and i want to this is i'm going to end now oh my lord this is all good stuff too not my preaching but god's word is so good but i gotta hit this as i look at this and i see in this in that message arrow of god's deliverance church tabernacle life tabernacle the condition they're in that something isn't matching up anymore he says i began to notice there's something different it ain't the same life tabernacle i used to come to diano es el mismo life staffer nacho on the oven here you've got one of the best churches i ever walked into in my life anywhere any continent life tabernacle is one of my favorites lifetime nachos favorites it breaks my heart to see you letting the world reach into you the way you're doing so don't do that no more yeah not part of it pray out of don't let the world creep into you don't let the world into your churches spray it out get out a second until god comes down and takes a hold of me keep the joy of the lord among the saints keep them prayed up guard every little place let me tell you life tabernacle iglesias singapore new women and stuff like the rest of the woman of the world that nearly killed me when i walked in here the other day there's only one woman in the bible that ever painted her face that's what he says you don't paint your face to meet god you paint your face to meet men you ever heard anybody say oh i gotta go i'm about to pray so i gotta go put on some some stuff on my face i'm about to pray about to go pray something real nice in my face we do that when we want to meet men hello everybody oh that one hit a sour note i think i better stop right there because that's like whoa watch now watch how the holy spirit through the prophet begins to shoot the arrow of deliverance and he focuses on the leadership the king joe ash is in how many lukewarm borderline preachers do we have whatever the congregation wants that's the way the preacher preaches not here that they don't want me no more here they can say ah we don't want you no more here i will meet everyone on the day of judgement it was not my feelings my emotions i just i didn't want to be mean to people but how else do you get the people's attention only one church that'll be ready for a wrap oh my lord backslidden preachers that's what they do today but a god-sent holy ghost-born preacher compromised with any congregation but today it looks like the world making a little more money and it just made a sap out of you yes have they have not gone to the potter's house sometimes we need to be broken he can build us and make us vessels of honor i can't imagine but the will would you come to the piano can't even imagine what the jews thought after seeing the tabernacle in the wilderness the perfect match to what moses saw in heaven solomon builds the temple perfect what was seen in heaven jerusalem gave everything to the lord i worshiped and praised the lord without nobody could stop them but we lost our first love as we heard pero perdimon many have lost that first love mucho lumos perdido would it be the same what would he say if you walk through your homes would he be happy about it content would line be upon line linia would husband and wife be lying upon line esposos getting together you have to answer that question contestant when i look this at this and i learned so many other things my mind just it races it goes to lord help us out christ was the perfect masterpiece he matched every word of god exactly but i do want my experience to match god's bible and his requirements would you stand to your feet this opponent what was it [Applause] when we find our place it becomes a match made in heaven i'm going to say it again when we find out the part of the word that we are a match made in heaven that has come down to earth his word through his bride manifestando and i say lord sunovia let us as a body of believers let us make sure that we're lined
