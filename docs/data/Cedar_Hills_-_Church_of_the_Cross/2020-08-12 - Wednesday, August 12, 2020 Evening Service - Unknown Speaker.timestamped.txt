[38:20] getting
[38:21] out of the house
[38:24] they start grabbing things to take with
[38:26] them out of the house
[38:30] so you

[40:39] him
[40:42] behold thou are made whole
[40:46] sin no more no lest the worst thing come
[40:50] upon thee
[41:18] he said if you abide in me
[41:21] and my words abide in you
[41:24] then you must continue in him
[41:27] now we heard on sunday that we are
[41:30] dealing with a defeated enemy
[41:46] fox yes if i could catch
[41:50] him i'd put him in a box

[42:35] i'm going to give you some scriptures i
[42:38] don't have time to give you the
[42:39] foundations of these scriptures
[42:42] so
[43:09] and the lords of the philistines came up
[43:11] unto her
[43:16] and said unto her entice him
[43:20] and see where in his great strength
[43:24] and by what means we may prevail against
[43:26] him
[43:29] that we may bind him to afflict him
[43:34] and we will give thee every one of us
[43:37] 1100 pieces of silver
[43:42] platter and delilah said to sampson tell
[43:44] me
[43:47] i pray yo where is my great strength
[43:50] goliath
[43:52] consisted and wherewith thou mighty
[43:55] mightiest be bound to afflict thee
[44:00] and samson said unto her if they bind me
[44:04] with
[44:04] seven green wits
[44:30] and she said unto him how can this thou
[44:34] say i love thee when thine heart is not
[44:37] with me
[44:39] thou hast mocked me these three times
[44:43] and hath not told me we're in thy great
[44:45] strength
[44:48] to
[45:15] and she urged him importantly
[45:18] so that his soul was vexed unto death
[45:25] we are dealing
[45:28] with a defeated enemy he's
[45:56] whatever the virus says
[46:40] there's a spiritual

[55:39] exodus 3 7.
[55:44] and the lord said i have surely seen the
[55:45] afflictions of my people

[56:02] and i am come down to deliver them out
[56:04] of the hand of the egyptians
[56:11] so god has heard our cries yes
[56:20] now i had a hard time with this message
[56:27] because the lord gave it to me
[57:07] and the lord said unto moses when thou
[57:10] goest to return into egypt
[57:14] see that thou do all those wonders
[57:16] before pharaoh
[57:19] which i have put yeah in thine hands

[58:46] want to take
[59:03] so we think oh god's going to come
[59:04] deliver us
[59:07] no sorry no no sir
[59:11] no senor he said i have hardened
[59:14] thy heart of pharaoh
[59:29] these were pharaoh's slaves
[59:58] for the people
[1:00:10] because we were so tied up
[1:00:26] we're so tied up in technology
[1:00:28] technology
[1:00:29] we're so tied up in egypt in the world
[1:00:34] that he said it was easier

[1:05:10] but they didn't want him i wonder today
[1:05:13] if our prayers you hear them say pray
[1:05:17] for a great revival
[1:05:49] but when god sends it in the way that he
[1:05:51] wants to but
[1:05:54] then it's not according to our tastes
[1:06:00] and therefore we won't receive it no
[1:06:04] and that's the way it was in that day
[1:06:07] if he was not in the taste of their
[1:06:09] beliefs
[1:06:11] they would not receive him
[1:06:14] again today that's the reason i asked
[1:06:18] the question
[1:06:21] who is this
[1:06:26] right so we pray and we pray to god
[1:06:30] now
[1:06:36] right and we hear the scripture i mean
[1:06:38] we we we
[1:06:40] phrase the scripture all the time
[1:06:44] i have never seen the righteous forsaken
[1:06:48] um
[1:06:52] or god's seed begging bread
[1:06:57] hold on
[1:07:13] right and we always think that begging
[1:07:15] for bread
[1:07:18] i always think yo
[1:07:21] my mind goes to i'm never going to be
[1:07:23] begging for money
[1:07:33] then jesus went dance and departed into
[1:07:35] the coast of tyree and syria
[1:07:38] said on quinceanera
[1:07:55] how fair is that here here's jesus
[1:07:58] jesus sent to the lost sheep of the
[1:08:00] house of israel
[1:08:04] israel and he's about to tell
[1:08:08] somebody in their own town
[1:08:11] in supropio uh sweden that it's not
[1:08:14] right that he gives her
[1:08:15] any bread
[1:08:21] right well then why didn't you stay in
[1:08:24] the children's city
[1:08:29] right isn't he went where the gentiles
[1:08:33] were
[1:08:35] right and here's a woman
[1:08:48] have mercy on me oh lord
[1:09:04] so the bible says that she was
[1:09:07] crying out to him yesterday have mercy
[1:09:10] on me
[1:09:12] thou son of david have mercy on me
[1:09:17] she was like she was begging him
[1:09:21] she was begging for him have mercy on me
[1:09:25] let me see recording
[1:09:26] but we do that many times so much
[1:09:29] but we don't know the difference i'm
[1:09:32] begging
[1:09:46] lord mr dicor
[1:09:50] mikasa right you're done
[1:09:53] have mercy on me let me see so we beg
[1:09:58] any answer not a word
[1:10:14] [Applause]
[1:10:20] that's why jesus told peter jesus when
[1:10:23] you're converted strengthen your
[1:10:24] brothers
[1:10:42] i am not sent
[1:10:45] but unto the lost sheep of the house of
[1:10:47] israel
[1:10:53] right but she continued begging
[1:11:52] that
[1:12:34] it is not right
[1:13:16] is
[1:13:54] oh i i could really go into the seventh
[1:13:57] angel right here
[1:13:57] well yeah
[1:14:39] now over here in john sixth
[1:14:52] okay so we just read that he had gone up
[1:14:56] now we we just read that he had just he
[1:14:59] went over to the sea of galilee right
[1:15:03] okay so we're going to take up the same
[1:15:05] that he had jesus went over to the sea
[1:15:07] of galilee which is of the sea of
[1:15:08] tiber's
[1:15:12] and there was a great multitude yeah via
[1:15:13] grand multitude now in verse 6 again it
[1:15:15] says here
[1:15:17] so right after that incident with the
[1:15:19] woman that was begging for breath
[1:15:22] and he said it's not meat that i give
[1:15:24] you bread
[1:15:26] um
[1:15:30] and he didn't give her bread
[1:15:35] but he gave her bread
[1:15:52] and then he felt bad for the people
[1:15:56] and he said let's feed the people
[1:16:00] get every man to sit down
[1:16:04] phillip said where were we gonna buy
[1:16:05] bread
[1:16:09] and then we find out that jesus jesus
[1:16:12] multiplied the bread multiplication
[1:16:16] and then we find out that the children
[1:16:25] we find out that jesus goes over to the
[1:16:27] other side of the mountain
[1:16:30] and then we find out that in the morning
[1:17:00] when did you get here augustus the
[1:17:02] common answer would have been
[1:17:05] oh i got here last night or i got here
[1:17:09] early this morning
[1:17:11] right but no jesus didn't say that jesus
[1:17:17] can you imagine this conversation hey
[1:17:20] william
[1:17:21] hey william brother romano when did you
[1:17:23] get here well new augustus
[1:17:24] okay okay fairly very i say unto you
[1:17:41] imagine that conversation is a
[1:18:01] that's rude right you didn't come here
[1:18:05] because you were
[1:18:06] looking for me but labor not for the
[1:18:09] meat
[1:18:20] which the son of man shall give unto you
[1:18:23] for him hath god the father sealed
[1:18:27] that day unto him what shall we do that
[1:18:31] we might
[1:18:31] work the works of god
[1:18:34] [Music]
[1:18:37] jesus tells them
[1:18:54] he told the woman the same thing
[1:18:58] it's not me for me to give this to dogs
[1:19:03] right and she said okay lord
[1:19:06] but i'll take the crown
[1:19:34] shall
[1:19:47] jesus answered them
[1:20:25] what's greater than oh man greater than
[1:20:27] raising the dead yes
[1:20:29] jesus did that brother branham did that
[1:20:32] and i'm not a brethren
[1:20:33] that's already been done yesterday oh
[1:20:35] but the greater word
[1:20:37] is my honest jesus said these are the
[1:20:40] works of god
[1:20:41] believe on him
[1:20:56] if you can get them to believe
[1:21:24] all right the conversation went back to
[1:21:26] bread
[1:21:40] then jesus said unto them verily verily
[1:21:44] i say unto you
[1:21:46] moses gave you not that bread
[1:21:50] from heaven but my father giveth you the
[1:21:53] true bread from heaven

[1:22:10] then said they unto him lord evermore
