[26:49] correct
[26:51] House of God
[26:53] it's like Casa de dios
[26:55] you come and worship and praise him
[27:03] heavenly father as we come before you
[27:05] tonight Lord
[27:08] first of all we want to say we we love
[27:10] you with all our hearts
[27:15] we ask that you put me to your side
[27:20] you speak to the people Lord
[27:23] May nothing come out of my mouth
[27:29] maybe contrary Lord
[27:31] maybe you speaking the right word
[27:35] we thank you we love you Lord
[27:47] we thank you we love you in the name of
[27:49] the Lord Jesus Christ we pray amen
[27:54] let's turn to our Bibles
[28:01] Romans 6 6
[28:03] says
[28:13] first of all I want to thank the Lord
[28:18] for the confidence
[28:21] should you speak the word tonight
[28:25] I want to thank the pastor pastor and
[28:28] each and every one of you yeah
[28:32] knowing this
[28:36] that our old man is crucified with him
[28:44] that's a body of sin might be destroyed
[28:48] foreign
[29:18] knowing that
[29:21] what is going on with us
[29:24] what's going on in our lives
[29:28] we're not the right kind of people
[29:32] it's it's it's not me no soyo
[29:36] this is not the real me
[29:40] so you cannot receive the new birth
[29:45] without dying out first
[29:48] the day I died
[29:51] I understood my true identity
[29:57] before the foundation of the world
[30:01] the more I die to myself
[30:09] now I understand why
[30:13] I needed to go through this trials
[30:17] and tribulation
[30:20] to see
[30:23] that transformation
[30:26] when you die out of
[30:31] you will recognize who you really are
[30:36] now I understand
[30:39] now I understand
[30:42] we need a profit
[30:46] um
[30:48] now I understand why
[30:51] we needed
[30:55] now I understand why
[30:58] why the Lord blessed me with a good wife
[31:02] and a good family now I understand why
[31:06] we need a pastor that we have right now
[31:11] why we need each and every one of us
[31:16] so it's it's very important it's very
[31:19] important to be born again
[31:21] so we have to die out of ourselves
[31:24] in our own will is
[31:34] you say well I want God's perfect will
[31:37] yokirola
[31:40] I'm gonna say something
[31:44] you say well we all want God's perfect
[31:46] will
[31:48] and God's perfect will is not not always
[31:51] a better roses
[31:55] it hurts sometimes but you got to take
[31:58] it
[32:02] it's for our own good is
[32:05] you see the three Hebrew children in in
[32:07] the when they were in the furnace
[32:12] they wouldn't have never had an
[32:14] experience
[32:21] so they had to have an experience
[32:29] so sometimes when uh you see an
[32:32] illegitimate tree
[32:35] that's already there yes you can't prune
[32:39] that tree
[32:41] so the only way you can prune a tree
[32:46] when it's giving fruit is
[32:50] so my question is this is
[32:55] how many perfect trees do we have here
[32:57] tonight
[33:00] God can only prove you
[33:03] know
[33:04] only when you're producing something
[33:09] it's already giving it's already giving
[33:11] something yes I'll go
[33:14] so why does God prune the tree for him
[33:18] if you cut that sickness away
[33:21] be forced to start before it starts
[33:24] spreading out
[33:28] why do we go through these trials and
[33:30] tribulations
[33:38] so you say trials and tribulations
[33:47] you go through depression
[33:50] depression you say well I did something
[33:52] wrong maybe I did a mistake I I failed
[33:55] it's
[33:57] not always the case
[33:59] if you look at the prophet uh you look
[34:02] at Job Prophet I hope
[34:05] he had trials
[34:08] he was a perfect and upright man
[34:12] perfect man perfect
[34:19] God asked the devil told the devil
[34:25] devil the devil's minding his own
[34:27] business
[34:36] so what did God do it's okay he made the
[34:40] devil think a little bit
[34:43] and he goes
[34:45] it might sound like Garza he's an
[34:48] instigator
[34:49] he says
[34:53] but he's not I don't know is
[34:56] and he goes
[34:58] yeah well you gave him everything
[35:04] but don't touch your soul
[35:09] so you look at this how much confidence
[35:11] did God have in job
[35:16] and Hope
[35:19] does he have confidence in me
[35:21] and me does he have confidence in you
[35:26] devil will make you feel like you're a
[35:28] nobody
[35:30] if that's the case why is he always
[35:33] after you yes
[35:35] because he's just lying to you
[35:38] the devil says you're weak
[35:42] you are nobody but it's not that all
[35:45] right let's go to second Samuel um 339
[35:52] foreign
[36:21] foreign
[36:28] so whatever you're going through
[36:31] it doesn't matter what you're going
[36:33] through
[36:35] you're still anointed you're still going
[36:37] to prayer yes
[36:39] and that's what drives a double crazy
[36:44] and what drives the devil crazy even
[36:47] more he is
[36:49] when you ask God for something
[36:52] and God doesn't give it to you and God
[36:56] and you can still serve the Lord with
[36:57] all your heart
[37:02] and David made the statement
[37:07] I am this day
[37:09] devil
[37:13] was still anointed
[37:17] did you know that it is possible
[37:20] you can be weak but still you're you're
[37:22] anointing
[37:26] the Bible says that we're a royal
[37:28] priesthood is
[37:43] weakness and anointed they stand
[37:46] together
[37:47] foreign
[37:58] to overcome
[38:02] we are people of victory Victoria
[38:10] and and tonight
[38:13] we have the devil going
[38:19] so why why do we do the things that we
[38:23] do
[38:26] you know
[38:27] sometimes we we go through through life
[38:32] you see something and you put it in
[38:35] God's hands
[38:37] and and the word says that the Lord
[38:41] shall fight for you
[38:43] and he shall hold your peace
[38:48] now we have to lift our banners way
[38:51] higher tonight
[38:57] he can hold his peace
[39:02] you can hold your peace
[39:06] bad thoughts
[39:07] amientos you can hold your peace
[39:10] Trials of life
[39:13] he can't hold your peace
[39:15] how can God trust us with this message
[39:21] because we have call us before the
[39:22] foundation of the world
[39:25] well I've never met brother
[39:29] you don't have to
[40:06] foreign
[40:46] because that's your light shine
[40:51] be foreign
[41:16] so this message
[41:17] and the word and they will shake the
[41:20] kingdom of hell
[41:23] de limpierno the same holy ghost
[41:27] that was with brother banham
[41:30] it's on the bright tonight
[41:33] and the bride will have a double portion
[41:36] is
[41:41] so the Greater Works
[41:45] they speak eternal life I've learned
[41:49] live for your brother
[41:52] will be possible
[41:54] live for your brother
[41:58] if you want healing tonight
[42:01] if you want your son and daughter back
[42:03] tonight
[42:05] if you want your family back
[42:08] if you want your healing back if you
[42:11] want to join back
[42:13] if you want your Victory back it is all
[42:17] you have to do yes
[42:21] Bossier
[42:23] in John 14 14.
[42:27] if you ask anything in my name is
[42:31] I might do it
[42:34] I will do it
[42:37] so this message is a person yes
[42:43] it's a person of Jesus Christ
[42:45] it has to become tangible
[42:48] but you can touch them
[42:51] this message has to produce
[42:54] the holy ghost in your life is
[43:01] deceived
[43:05] so the weakest Christian tonight can
[43:07] defeat the Devil any place anytime
[43:09] anywhere
[43:19] of the Lord
[43:25] so another thing I want to remind the
[43:27] devil
[43:30] is one of the things that the angel
[43:32] specified
[43:35] nothing will stand
[43:40] anger
[44:21] well Elisha
[44:30] if God is God
[44:32] and that's his Prophet yes
[44:37] I got to take this place
[44:40] and I need a spirit to do it
[44:43] now if God is God
[44:48] and brother was a prophet lemon
[44:51] we got to check that prophecya
[44:55] now this message
[44:59] we gotta gotta have to tailor us foreign
[45:33] there's nothing that can defeat right
[45:35] now
[45:38] and God has called us
[45:40] to be a confirmation
[45:46] and I believe that with all my heart
[45:50] there were more than Overcomers tonight
[45:53] we will not be defeated
[45:57] there's not an invincible Army coming
[46:00] Adventure
[46:08] invincible
[46:09] there's not a uh
[46:12] it's already here tonight yes and it's
[46:15] right here's been sitting down in front
[46:16] of us
[46:18] the the generation of David
[46:27] would have loved
[46:31] gustado
[46:32] to have these people here tonight is
[46:43] well God has you here tonight for
[46:45] another reason
[46:48] you are the final voice for the final
[46:50] for the final age
[46:55] as long as you're in God's will
[46:58] nothing can stop you
[47:01] because for I am persuaded
[47:05] another death
[47:07] death
[47:09] or nor life
[47:24] the mark of the High Calling
[47:27] Jesus
[47:31] so we are
[47:33] more than able
[47:36] and we will fight
[47:38] don't give up
[47:42] because God is with us
[47:46] because the holy spirit will rise up a
[47:48] standard against them
[47:51] and you young people
[47:55] you have the power
[47:58] to create atmospheres around you
[48:02] foreign
[48:12] well it's too late for him now yes we
[48:15] are the manifestations of sons of God
[48:20] doesn't even have his own vocabulary
[48:24] he uses God's word and tries to twist it
[48:27] around
[48:29] so he's powerless tonight
[48:32] we are predestinated
[48:35] should be here tonight
[48:37] before you say let there be light
[48:42] you knew you were going to be blessed
[48:45] before he said
[48:48] she said you were already healed
[48:51] before he said letter b
[48:55] see ya
[48:57] you are people of victory Victoria
[49:05] Branham
[49:07] Brenham I made a mistake
[49:11] last week
[49:14] or last month
[49:16] I don't care how many mistakes you made
[49:21] we've all sail and come short of the
[49:24] glory
[49:25] is
[49:27] if you're a child of Abraham
[49:30] you're ready to recognize that as him
[49:36] and come back to God again
[49:41] still hangs foreign
[50:18] when Elisha
[50:22] Jordan
[50:25] as we know that was death
[50:28] separation separation
[50:32] I like the way he said it
[50:34] when you cross over Jordan
[50:37] he says this it wasn't that bad see
[50:42] death
[50:44] it's really bad
[50:59] you're going to recognize it wasn't that
[51:01] bad
[51:04] we're here for Elisha says here right
[51:07] quick
[51:08] yeah
[51:11] see you
[51:12] and he knows yes they are foreign
[51:34] don't worry
[51:36] when I died out Leo Marie
[51:39] when I died to myself
[51:42] I gave up everything
[51:44] I was the happiest man on the face of
[51:47] the year
[51:49] because God transforms you okay
[51:53] he'll make a way for you
[51:58] and you'll send a Revival in your soul
[52:00] is
[52:05] [Applause]
[52:15] foreign
[52:22] God bless his word
[52:24] God bless this word can you bless the
[52:27] Lord this evening
[52:30] come on come on Church Ramos Iglesia can
[52:33] you bless the Lord this evening
[52:36] because one day yeah
[52:45] does it still thrill your soul to see
[52:48] that cross in front of you as uh
[52:53] that crossed his death it's a cruise so
[52:57] let us stand
[53:00] we'll be speaking on the day I died
[53:06] First Corinthians 15 31 remember
[53:11] and this is our scripture that our
[53:13] pastor has given us the Lord has given
[53:15] us this year yes
[53:20] Paul says I protest by your rejoicing
[53:23] which I have in Christ Jesus our lord
[53:27] I Die daily
[53:40] amen you may be seated may the Lord add
[53:42] His blessings to the reading of the
[53:43] words
[53:47] the day I died
[53:50] why is this statement so important
[53:54] why do we even need to hear it today
[53:58] it's something that nobody likes to talk
[54:00] about
[54:03] nobody likes to talk about death
[54:06] maybe it makes me feel funny
[54:09] even I when you hear someone that's
[54:12] passed away
[54:15] I don't know how to deal with it uh
[54:20] and I don't have I don't know how to
[54:22] comprehend it
[54:24] but Jesus has said Jesus that if any one
[54:30] would come after me okay
[54:33] let him deny himself
[54:42] why why would you want to take up a
[54:44] cross
[54:47] the cross means death
[54:49] wouldn't I just look like
[54:52] a dead person all the time
[54:56] so black and gloomy
[55:00] this cross means something is
[55:03] that's what the Romans instructed
[55:08] to be put in place
[55:11] they wanted to put a statement out to
[55:13] the Jews humiliation
[55:21] that when you are seen died
[55:25] that when you are dead on the cross
[55:28] it's the notice to the rest of them
[55:34] to bring fear into their lives
[55:38] and you deny yourself
[55:41] the day I died
[55:44] this phrase has impacted me
[55:47] because I start thinking about questions
[55:53] it gets personality should get personal
[55:57] in you
[55:58] can you say the day that I died
[56:02] can you repeat it again
[56:04] it's got to get personal
[56:08] it causes you to examine yourself
[56:11] this is our thing for the year
[56:14] not just something you that you just
[56:17] think of once
[56:20] so what happened on the day that I died
[56:43] this question is
[56:46] also in a
[56:49] processo because we live in time
[56:53] this question this statement points me
[56:56] to a milestone is
[57:05] can you think of the last day that you
[57:07] died
[57:10] but I'm breathing right now brother Seth
[57:14] you know it's the day that I died
[57:19] is when I died to this old sinful nature
[57:25] when I die to the sinful flesh
[57:30] I was born with this
[57:33] I didn't really want it it was the sin
[57:37] that I was given yeah
[57:42] I was born in this I inherited this yes
[57:46] we come to this world speaking lives
[57:49] we come with a lot of bad habits
[57:52] habits that we don't even choose
[57:53] ourselves
[57:55] maybe something that we inherit from
[57:57] family members
[58:00] but most of all we come alienated from
[58:03] God
[58:06] we come with a lot of unbelief
[58:10] so this is
[58:19] foreign
[59:05] better this year
[59:09] maybe I can take some classes and learn
[59:11] how to sing better
[59:14] it's a resolution
[59:16] a resolution supposed to mean something
[59:19] significant that's a firm decision to do
[59:22] something
[59:24] only about 46 of the people
[59:29] make a resolution
[59:32] actually keep it
[59:35] the day that I died
[59:38] can you ask yourself
[59:41] so we want to upgrade our habits all
[59:43] right
[59:45] so I want to I want you to imagine
[59:47] something
[59:48] we're going to look at two characters
[59:51] all right
[59:53] these two people
[59:55] are smokers so a full man I'm not gonna
[59:58] just pick on the smokers
[1:00:01] but if you want to parallel it is
[1:00:06] these two people are Christians as well
[1:00:09] and they're trying to resist a cigarette
[1:00:14] someone is dangling a cigarette in front
[1:00:17] of you every day
[1:00:20] something of sin in front of you every
[1:00:23] day
[1:00:25] and when you're offered this is
[1:00:30] when you're offered doubt brother Ronnie
[1:00:33] the first person says
[1:00:36] no thanks no gracias I'm trying to quit
[1:00:41] you see I made a New Year's resolution
[1:00:44] to quit
[1:00:47] I'm trying pretty hard every day all
[1:00:49] right
[1:00:50] I'm trying very hard
[1:00:53] sounds like a regional response
[1:00:56] but this person
[1:00:59] the problem with this mentality
[1:01:05] it's very subtle as we uh we as we begin
[1:01:09] this person still believes they are a
[1:01:11] smoker
[1:01:13] you still believe that you are a sinner
[1:01:16] you haven't died out fully all right you
[1:01:19] know
[1:01:21] you still think you're that old guy from
[1:01:24] last year
[1:01:25] and your hopes being that you can try
[1:01:28] and change your life
[1:01:31] but you still carry that baggage of of
[1:01:34] Doubt or sin upon it is
[1:01:38] the second person says
[1:01:41] he says no thanks he said no when you
[1:01:45] offer something to him
[1:01:50] no I'm not a sinner no more
[1:01:55] you can can find yourself in this is
[1:02:05] myself
[1:02:30] and I'd rather say that I'm trying to
[1:02:33] go to church
[1:02:38] stop trying tonight
[1:02:42] tonight
[1:03:19] it's hard every day there has to be
[1:03:23] something that's every day
[1:03:26] that's the resolution
[1:03:30] vamos
[1:04:07] you see the Apostle Paul tells you yeah
[1:04:10] I died daily
[1:04:12] um
[1:04:15] it's a choice he made
[1:04:17] he got a little right he got Revelation
[1:04:21] the Lord himself
[1:04:24] changed his course
[1:04:29] one way
[1:04:30] it is now another yeah
[1:04:34] identified with
[1:04:37] Christo I Paul a prisoner of Christ
[1:04:41] you know he went from Saul for this
[1:04:47] persecuting all the Christians
[1:04:50] to maybe the cheese whistle Sinners
[1:04:54] all the Christians to come back to
[1:04:57] Christo
[1:05:06] this theme has kept
[1:05:09] kept
[1:05:11] telling me yes
[1:05:14] what have I done in my life
[1:05:17] how many times last year did I die die
[1:05:22] and said Lord
[1:05:26] I don't want to do what I want to do you
[1:05:28] know
[1:05:30] you know I have dreams and aspirations
[1:05:36] the Lord
[1:05:38] Lord senor
[1:05:41] I want to die for you
[1:05:45] you died for me
[1:05:47] can I die for you
[1:05:53] the day that I died
[1:05:55] and I'm not done
[1:05:57] because there's a lot of more Brothers
[1:06:00] Seth that needs to die
[1:06:03] but this year let's start it today
[1:06:11] for I am crucified with Christ
[1:06:15] nevertheless
[1:06:19] but Christ Living in Christ and the life
[1:06:23] which I now live yeah
[1:06:27] I live by faith
[1:06:29] can you believe on God's word today
[1:06:37] and gave me for himself
[1:06:40] that's the day that I died
[1:06:43] when I heard a preacher
[1:06:47] God call me I was dead and sins and
[1:06:51] trespassed foreign
[1:08:32] I said you yourself I'm a prisoner of
[1:08:35] Christ
[1:08:37] can you put your name in there it's a
[1:08:40] good day to die
[1:08:42] he wants you to die because when you die
[1:08:46] to sin foreign
[1:09:02] a milestone to look at yeah
[1:09:05] because when someone dangles some sin in
[1:09:09] front of them
[1:09:11] it's not I'm trying to quit
[1:09:14] no that's the day that I died
[1:09:16] I know what that looks like
[1:09:20] it's over there
[1:09:22] it's on the tree
[1:09:27] it's crucified with Christ
[1:09:30] the day that I died
[1:09:33] is the day we become a new creature
[1:09:39] to Die daily
[1:09:41] that's the day that I died
[1:09:44] is the day I chose to go back to God is
[1:09:57] especially in the morning especially in
[1:10:00] Las mananas got to make sure he's dead
[1:10:04] let this be the day you died
[1:10:08] as brother will comes forward
[1:10:11] second Corinthians 5 14.
[1:10:18] for the love of Christ constraineth us
[1:10:25] because with us judge
[1:10:28] that if one died for all then we were
[1:10:30] all dead
[1:10:35] and that he died for all
[1:10:38] that they which live should not
[1:10:41] henceforth live unto themselves
[1:10:43] but unto him which died for them and
[1:10:46] rose again
[1:10:55] wherefore henceforth no we know man
[1:10:58] after the flesh yea though we have known
[1:11:01] Christ after the flesh yet now
[1:11:03] henceforth know we him no more
[1:11:13] yeah therefore
[1:11:20] If any man be in Christ
[1:11:23] he is a new creature
[1:11:25] a new creature all things are passed
[1:11:29] away behold all things are become new
[1:11:31] then
[1:11:46] will be the day you die
[1:11:50] don't be scared
[1:11:53] I was scared
[1:11:55] but the day you die
[1:11:57] you're going to become a new creature
[1:12:00] and you will fulfill the purpose that
[1:12:03] God has meant for everyone
[1:12:06] who is not a negative thing we look at
[1:12:10] the positive
[1:12:13] eternal life
[1:12:14] God bless you
[1:12:16] [Applause]
[1:12:28] thank you
[1:12:32] amen God bless you this evening
[1:12:37] Daniel that's brother Seth Seth there
[1:12:41] was some good stuff
[1:12:45] I think we're done already right
[1:12:49] amen I'm going to ask you to stand
[1:12:52] yeah amen I thank our pastor for this
[1:12:56] opportunity this evening
[1:12:59] to uh to share what I what I have on my
[1:13:02] heart
[1:13:04] amen and uh we're gonna turn into the
[1:13:07] book of Galatians
[1:13:11] and uh we're gonna start with uh
[1:13:16] thank you
[1:13:23] we'll start with verse 18. foreign
[1:13:43] or if I build again the things which I
[1:13:45] destroyed
[1:13:47] I make myself a transgressor
[1:13:49] is
[1:13:59] for I through the law am dead to the law
[1:14:02] that I might live unto God
[1:14:09] verse 20 I am crucified with Christ
[1:14:12] nevertheless I live
[1:14:14] yet not I
[1:14:16] but Christ liveth in me
[1:14:18] and the life which I now live in the
[1:14:20] flesh I live by the faith of the Son of
[1:14:23] God Who Loved Me
[1:14:25] and gave himself for me crucified
[1:14:31] [Music]
[1:14:45] you know it's uh it's something uh that
[1:14:49] the theme of this year was the day that
[1:14:52] I died uh
[1:14:59] um
[1:15:00] as I was uh as I was thinking about this
[1:15:06] it uh brought me to a couple of stories
[1:15:10] and you hear this all the time
[1:15:15] especially during the time of Easter is
[1:15:19] people just doing
[1:15:22] insane things
[1:15:28] to be crucified said crucified
[1:15:30] literallymente
[1:15:33] there's a story of a man
[1:15:35] um his name was Patrice de Mao is
[1:15:40] he was a man of uh of the Dominican
[1:15:43] Republic
[1:15:45] Dominicana and he wanted to be crucified
[1:15:49] crucified and he set up this uh this
[1:15:52] event
[1:15:54] I was televised
[1:15:59] and it was viewed by thousands and
[1:16:03] thousands of people
[1:16:07] this man had three six inch stainless
[1:16:10] steel nails driven through his hands
[1:16:14] uh
[1:16:19] and intended to stay on the cross for 48
[1:16:22] hours is
[1:16:26] however after just 20 hours
[1:16:29] he requested to be taken down because he
[1:16:32] developed an infection
[1:16:37] this man was taking I am crucified with
[1:16:40] Christ literally
[1:16:46] another Kenyan man
[1:16:50] also wanted to be crucified
[1:16:53] crucified but he wanted to
[1:16:57] he sought to be crucified
[1:17:00] crucified to show his Devotion to Jesus
[1:17:05] he wanted to secure
[1:17:08] forgiveness for his country yes
[1:17:13] what he did one day
[1:17:16] was he asked his wife Esposa
[1:17:20] wife esposa would you crucify me
[1:17:23] crucifix now man don't don't go home
[1:17:27] after after the servant says
[1:17:31] don't try this at home okay
[1:17:37] I'm serious
[1:17:39] the inside you
[1:17:41] he was compelled
[1:17:43] to be crucified
[1:17:46] after reluct after reluctantly obeying
[1:17:50] is
[1:17:53] posa crucified him low crucifico
[1:17:57] after she did this
[1:17:59] she immediately she immediately
[1:18:01] collapsed
[1:18:04] and died from shock
[1:18:09] this man was rescued by his neighbors
[1:18:14] but later was he he died from infections
[1:18:20] and what does this say it's
[1:18:24] easy especil to say
[1:18:28] I want to be crucified with Christ
[1:18:33] when we're in what we what we would say
[1:18:36] are elements
[1:18:40] when we're here in church
[1:18:43] the spirit is moving
[1:18:45] it feels good it feels right
[1:18:49] correct we say
[1:18:51] I want to be crucified
[1:18:54] I can do it
[1:18:57] but many times even as soon as we leave
[1:19:00] service
[1:19:03] what we felt just minutes ago
[1:19:08] seemed like an eternity
[1:19:11] and now being crucified with Christ
[1:19:16] is no longer a priority in our lives
[1:19:20] we've taken what we've heard
[1:19:24] and we've thought about it
[1:19:27] we've felt it
[1:19:30] we had an emotion about it
[1:19:34] but we are never we never implemented
[1:19:41] when we look at the crucifixion
[1:19:44] when we look at what God has done for us
[1:19:48] when we look at the three crosses
[1:19:52] we can say
[1:19:54] well Christ was in the middle Christos
[1:19:57] you the thieves were on the side
[1:20:01] and there I was crucified with Christ
[1:20:05] and it sounds great
[1:20:08] it sounds uplifting
[1:20:14] but when it really comes down to it
[1:20:18] it seems like it's impossible but but
[1:20:22] it's impossible now I'm not here
[1:20:25] I'm not here no estoyaki to put a downer
[1:20:30] on this in any way but uh
[1:20:36] I'm not here to make it at all gloomy
[1:20:40] but I'm here to make you think
[1:20:45] I don't want to give you an emotion
[1:20:48] it has an emotion just lasts a little
[1:20:52] bit
[1:20:54] but when we can be really crucified with
[1:20:57] Christ
[1:21:00] I really understand what that means
[1:21:05] is that I am crucified with Christ
[1:21:11] because he died in my stead
[1:21:15] if we turn into the book of Romans
[1:21:18] we're going to go to Romans 6 6. Romano
[1:21:21] says
[1:21:24] ah
[1:21:30] it says
[1:21:32] knowing this
[1:21:34] that our old man is crucified with him
[1:21:38] that the body of sin might be destroyed
[1:21:42] that henceforth we should not serve sin
[1:21:47] is
[1:21:56] for he that is dead
[1:21:59] [Music]
[1:22:03] is freed
[1:22:05] from sin
[1:22:08] what a paradox that is that Paul would
[1:22:12] say
[1:22:13] I Die daily
[1:22:17] I say oh my goodness
[1:22:20] so what does that mean yes well we heard
[1:22:24] it from Brother uh brother Seth
[1:22:26] everything that we do
[1:22:29] all that we have done
[1:22:32] and what we're going to do in the future
[1:22:36] it does every single day
[1:22:40] or is that just me
[1:22:43] what we did last year
[1:22:45] we look back
[1:22:48] and have regrets
[1:22:51] and have things that oh I got man I I
[1:22:54] just I just wish I would have done this
[1:22:56] better
[1:22:58] choice I wish I would have been a better
[1:23:01] father a better husband
[1:23:05] and it starts to torment us
[1:23:09] what we could have done differently
[1:23:14] all the mistakes we're making
[1:23:18] oh but there is something
[1:23:20] when we can leave
[1:23:26] to all the things that we have gone
[1:23:29] through
[1:23:30] and place them on the cross
[1:23:33] but it's the daily thing
[1:23:37] but
[1:23:38] sometimes it's just a Sunday thing I
[1:23:40] basically says
[1:23:42] sometimes it's just a Wednesday thing
[1:23:46] you know I was thinking of all the
[1:23:49] things that I did last year is it
[1:23:54] I was saying Lord because I said I know
[1:23:57] that you are the ultimate sacrifice
[1:24:01] you paid the price
[1:24:04] and I said Lord
[1:24:06] I did I did some pretty good sacrifices
[1:24:09] last year
[1:24:12] yeah I did see I think I did pretty good
[1:24:15] okay
[1:24:17] trying to justify myself a little bit
[1:24:22] I went on a quite a few missionary trips
[1:24:26] good for me um
[1:24:29] I think I served the Lord pretty good
[1:24:32] last year
[1:24:35] and he says I didn't call you to
[1:24:37] sacrifice
[1:24:43] when I when I heard that for myself
[1:24:49] I said Lord what do you mean
[1:24:55] I'm I'm doing what you're what you're
[1:24:58] what you've called me to do
[1:25:01] and it takes me to email I'm gonna skip
[1:25:05] a few things here
[1:25:09] take me to Luke 22 42. you have a uh uh
[1:25:13] Lucas
[1:25:16] Italian when I was a young preacher 20
[1:25:18] minutes felt like an eternity
[1:25:23] as you get older 20 minutes feels like
[1:25:26] seconds
[1:25:29] we're going to skip a few things here 22
[1:25:32] 42.
[1:25:35] he says father say Padre if thou be
[1:25:39] willing remove this cup from me
[1:25:43] nevertheless we don't know not my will
[1:25:47] but thine be done
[1:25:51] here is the sacrifice
[1:25:53] Lord what what do you want what do you
[1:25:56] want me to to get out of this is
[1:26:02] Philippians 2 5 through 8.
[1:26:07] it says let this mind be in you which
[1:26:09] was also in Christ Jesus
[1:26:13] Christ so being in the form of God
[1:26:18] started not robbery to be equal with God
[1:26:22] but made himself of no reputation
[1:26:26] and took upon Him Commando the form of a
[1:26:30] servant and was made in the likeness of
[1:26:32] men
[1:26:37] he says you want to sacrifice
[1:26:40] you want to die out yeah
[1:26:44] but there's two things you got to do
[1:26:46] before that
[1:26:48] I said oh my goodness what do I have to
[1:26:51] do
[1:26:52] isn't isn't being dead enough
[1:26:56] isn't dying out to myself enough
[1:27:00] no he says this is what Jesus did
[1:27:04] verse 8 verse and being being found in
[1:27:08] fashion as a man standing condition
[1:27:10] number one numerono he humbled himself
[1:27:14] oh my goodness to get somebody to be
[1:27:18] humble
[1:27:20] to have humility
[1:27:25] to take away their pride
[1:27:29] I said Lord
[1:27:31] this year Lord I know that I have
[1:27:34] sacrificed but that's not but that's not
[1:27:36] it is
[1:27:46] he humbled himself
[1:27:48] and became
[1:27:51] so
[1:27:52] obedient oh my God so you got humility
[1:27:58] before death antes you've got
[1:28:03] obedience
[1:28:05] before death
[1:28:07] two things before you can even Die daily
[1:28:12] you gotta humble yourself
[1:28:17] so this this brought me to to a very
[1:28:21] something that might be insignificant
[1:28:24] I would say Lord
[1:28:27] all right
[1:28:29] I've I've got I've got
[1:28:32] I think I've got it
[1:28:35] he goes
[1:28:37] you're not even serving me in the
[1:28:39] smallest things
[1:28:42] you're
[1:28:43] doing terrible at this
[1:28:46] I said Lord what is it
[1:28:49] they're at service all the time
[1:28:53] I do all of this
[1:28:55] he says well take a look at something
[1:29:01] he says what about your time
[1:29:05] because are you there
[1:29:07] 30 minutes before the service starts
[1:29:14] I'm I'm here thinking that it's going to
[1:29:17] be some some huge thing in my life
[1:29:23] I look and I said well I Lord I try my
[1:29:26] best
[1:29:29] I got a job you know I I can work hard
[1:29:34] you know get out of work late sometimes
[1:29:38] but there you are
[1:29:42] sacrificing sacrification but you're
[1:29:44] sacrificing for the wrong thing
[1:29:47] I'm not calling you to sacrifice
[1:29:50] I'm calling you to be obedient
[1:29:53] I'm calling you to humble yourself
[1:29:56] and you haven't done it in the list of
[1:30:00] things
[1:30:04] so my question
[1:30:07] how crucified are we estamos crucified
[1:30:12] how crucified are our ears
[1:30:17] how crucified is our tongue
[1:30:21] how crucified are our eyes
[1:30:25] how crucified is our minds
[1:30:30] if he's gonna reign in us
[1:30:33] and we're gonna die out daily
[1:30:37] then we gotta real life
[1:30:44] that we have
[1:30:46] that God is going to use them
[1:30:49] to further
[1:30:51] his plan is
[1:30:54] yeah if see
[1:30:58] if C
[1:31:00] we can humble ourselves
[1:31:03] and be obedient
[1:31:05] I said Lord
[1:31:07] I said
[1:31:11] die now is a lot harder than what I
[1:31:13] thought
[1:31:17] he says
[1:31:18] but really it's not
[1:31:23] how hard is it to
[1:31:27] how hard is it to
[1:31:29] obey get done deficiness of what they
[1:31:32] said
[1:31:34] it's easy to obey is when the thing that
[1:31:39] you're being obedient obedient about is
[1:31:43] what you're comfortable with right
[1:31:47] the pastor told me to do this yeah
[1:31:54] well when I found myself
[1:31:57] Pastor said to be here 30 minutes early
[1:32:00] and I'm not doing what I'm supposed to
[1:32:01] be doing
[1:32:05] that's some that's me so yo so I said
[1:32:09] Lord
[1:32:10] I want to serve you in the big things
[1:32:13] but I gotta start with those small
[1:32:15] things
[1:32:17] I gotta get right
[1:32:19] I've got to see how I'm being crucified
[1:32:24] daily
[1:32:26] oh I'm dying daily
[1:32:29] Lord if it doesn't conform to your word
[1:32:34] Lord I'm not doing what I'm supposed to
[1:32:37] be doing
[1:32:38] you know this this year estano
[1:32:44] as we as we see it

[1:48:52] you may be seated foreign
[1:49:06] foreign
[1:49:21] the church is going to start using a app
[1:49:26] it's called The Church Center
[1:49:32] um and this is uh we're going to be
[1:49:33] using this for all of our communication
[1:49:37] for all the different groups in church
[1:49:41] and that way we can easily better
[1:49:44] communicate with each group
[1:49:49] um through all through one app so we're
[1:49:51] asking
[1:49:52] so we're asking if everyone can if you
[1:49:54] go to the App Store you can easily find
[1:49:56] it
[1:50:00] and it's really easy to sign up you just
[1:50:03] have to search for our church either by
[1:50:05] entering it in is
[1:50:11] or you can use the location of your
[1:50:13] device and it will search for
[1:50:15] foreign
[1:50:26] and so whenever you've
[1:50:30] I'm sorry you should play the Jeopardy
[1:50:32] we'll give you some time
[1:50:38] and so when you find our church you
[1:50:41] basically join it is
[1:50:46] there's just a few steps and then then
[1:50:49] you're basically attached to our account
[1:50:55] another important step after you do that
[1:50:58] is if you can go to your profile yes
[1:51:04] and please complete that because it
[1:51:07] doesn't automatically fill all that in
[1:51:08] it
[1:51:13] through this app we're also going to be
[1:51:15] posting all the events that are going on
[1:51:17] on at the church
[1:51:22] not only services but seminars youth
[1:51:25] meetings Etc anything like that is
[1:51:33] and also as well moving forward we're
[1:51:36] also going to start posting all our
[1:51:39] service information such as our YouTube
[1:51:40] videos in here as well all in one place
[1:51:42] so that you can have easy access to it
[1:51:44] yes
[1:51:51] um so after you join through the app it
[1:51:54] we will then assign you to certain
[1:51:56] groups that you pertain to depending on
[1:51:58] it is
[1:52:10] yes brother Mike
[1:52:14] how about you come over
[1:52:19] if anyone has any issues you can contact
[1:52:22] me or it's not that difficult I can
[1:52:23] definitely help anyone that needs yeah
[1:52:31] if there's anyone else
[1:52:34] yes brother Sammy
[1:52:38] no it comes up under Cedar Hills Church
[1:52:41] of the cross I believe you can search
[1:52:43] for either key term and it should come
[1:52:44] up
[1:52:45] Cedar Hills Church of the Cross
[1:52:49] there is a dash in there but I believe
[1:52:52] it comes up either way yes
[1:53:03] I think we can try to come up with a QR
[1:53:05] code if someone's having issues
[1:53:26] now
[1:53:30] amen
[1:53:33] yeah and we need it we need everyone to
[1:53:36] sign up not just one person for a
[1:53:37] household but if you have a device
[1:53:39] especially youth because like I said
[1:53:41] we're going to have different groups
[1:53:42] Youth and adults
[1:53:55] um like I said if you just search for it
[1:53:56] based upon your device location it'll
[1:53:58] give you a list of churches in the area
[1:53:59] it is in that list
[1:54:08] okay
