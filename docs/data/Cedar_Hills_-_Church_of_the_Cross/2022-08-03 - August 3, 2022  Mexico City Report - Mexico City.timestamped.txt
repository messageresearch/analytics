[37:14] in santiago capitulo cuatro verso
[37:17] and this is going to be a little bit of
[37:18] a recap of
[37:38] submit yourselves therefore to god
[37:41] resist the devil and he will flee from
[37:43] you
[37:48] draw night to god
[37:50] and he will draw nigh to you

[37:57] verse eight santiago cinco verso
[38:00] be also patient
[38:03] establish your hearts for the coming of
[38:05] the lord draweth nigh
[38:13] amen
[38:16] i want to thank our pastor and the
[38:17] ministry for this opportunity
[38:22] hey man so we had a great trip
[38:26] we had some great services some great
[38:28] preaching
[38:31] and we were we were blessed by brother
[38:33] on friday we were blessed by brother ben
[38:36] and brother will vienna
[38:39] ben and manuel tambien and we all know
[38:41] how they do it brother ben he's an
[38:43] awesome preacher
[38:53] and uh
[38:54] myself and brother danny we uh we uh we
[38:57] spoke on
[38:58] saturday morning
[39:06] i forget exactly who it was on saturday
[39:08] evening that gave their testimony
[39:11] and of course brother tommy junior on on
[39:14] saturday night romano tommy junior and
[39:17] as he always does he knocks it out of
[39:19] the park
[39:20] [Music]
[39:25] you know
[39:26] tommy has been such a great preacher for
[39:28] a long time
[39:31] he surely knows how to get everybody
[39:33] going the whole the crowd moving and
[39:34] he's he's awesome
[39:40] and of course uh that we had a couple of
[39:42] a few other brothers that gave a
[39:43] testimony on sunday morning
[39:46] testimonials uh domingo por la manana
[39:49] and uh he doesn't know this yet but i
[39:51] think i might be a little bit a little
[39:52] bit hurt with our pastor here
[39:54] no no
[39:57] because on sunday morning he preached
[39:59] twice domingo por la manana and this is
[40:02] like back to back services okay
[40:07] so i think brother caleb i think you owe
[40:08] us back to back one year too
[40:13] and of course as as we all know our
[40:15] pastor is phenomenal
[40:19] you know great preachings great services
[40:22] great food as always
[40:26] you know what i like from the brothers
[40:27] out there is
[40:29] man they're they're they're all
[40:31] i don't know any of the details i i
[40:33] honestly don't
[40:34] care to know any of the details of
[40:50] harmony a lot of respect towards each
[40:51] other
[40:55] and every time you you know they do
[40:56] something for you or you tell them thank
[40:58] you
[41:00] for whatever it is that they did
[41:04] they always say
[41:07] and they say i'm i'm here to serve you
[41:09] and it doesn't matter if it's the you
[41:10] know the preacher's wife the pastor's
[41:12] wife the the preachers the the the laity
[41:16] they all say that no importance
[41:30] so you want to know that something
[41:31] that's kind of funny
[41:35] i don't know how many i've been to
[41:36] mexico city but the traffic is insane
[41:43] so i mean that's it i i told brother
[41:46] raul that he almost gave me a heart
[41:47] attack like a hundred times over here
[41:51] i'm like i'm like i'm like hey wait wait
[41:53] wait wait and he's like just looks at me
[41:54] like
[41:56] this is normal here
[42:00] they get like inches away from the
[42:01] bumpers of you know of the vehicles in
[42:03] front of them or to the motorcycles
[42:05] they're like inches away
[42:09] and uh the funny thing was this
[42:12] though so when you get to the when you
[42:14] get to the streetlights
[42:17] and i saw this a few times okay so this
[42:18] is just like one occurrence
[42:21] that there's so much traffic and it's so
[42:23] crazy they drive so crazy out there that
[42:26] that even the dogs wait at the stoplight
[42:33] i was totally cracking up with with the
[42:35] brother because i was like man the dogs
[42:38] even you know have enough sense not to
[42:39] run out in traffic
[42:54] and we're coming to the red light he
[42:56] stops
[42:58] the cross traffic light turns green and
[43:00] there goes the dog
[43:08] you know so so a little bit to give
[43:10] again a little bit of a recap here what
[43:12] we spoke on
[43:15] so the theme of the subject was behold
[43:18] the bridegroom cometh
[43:25] and i i i honestly didn't you know the
[43:27] brother tommy jr has sent the text of
[43:29] what the theme was like a week in
[43:30] advance
[43:35] you know but i honestly didn't even
[43:36] think about it i was hoping i wasn't
[43:38] going to speak real
[43:40] in no series
[43:42] i always tell brother caleb give my give
[43:43] my time to somebody else
[43:48] but uh nonetheless
[43:50] you know it felt our lot to speak
[43:53] and wednesday night the lord gave me
[43:55] this thought right here
[43:58] and it might be a little bit different
[43:59] when we're normal we're we're normally
[44:01] uh used to speaking about
[44:05] because everybody
[44:07] knows that the lord jesus christ is
[44:08] coming amen
[44:11] that's what we're looking forward to
[44:12] right
[44:14] amen how there's not a lot of amen
[44:17] how many are waiting
[44:19] hey man how many are waiting for that
[44:21] bright group to come contoso
[44:23] you know so so here here was this angle
[44:25] that the i believe that the holy spirit
[44:26] gave me yesterday
[44:29] and i asked the brothers the question
[44:31] there
[44:32] and and uh when we've heard this year
[44:34] before
[44:36] and i asked them the question how many
[44:38] here that have been serving the lord for
[44:40] 50 years
[44:46] let's see raise your hands
[45:03] one uno
[45:06] like i know we've all been here saving
[45:08] the lord for a lot longer than that i've
[45:09] known most of you all all your lives
[45:14] days how many years brother no
[45:16] entertainers 20 years well he's becoming
[45:19] a church and he was about 20 years old
[45:20] right
[45:23] so i asked him we all know we all know
[45:25] that the word rapture means to be taken
[45:27] by force right
[45:32] how many know that the word rapture
[45:33] means to be taken by force
[45:36] significa
[45:38] but out of your 20 30 40 50 years that
[45:40] you've been serving the lord
[45:45] how many do they have to force to want
[45:47] to want to go see the lord
[45:49] necessity
[45:52] do you have to be forced
[45:54] i mean that's what that's what we serve
[45:56] the lord for right we we're we're
[45:58] waiting for an
[46:10] out of your 10 years have you been
[46:12] serving the lord how many don't want to
[46:13] see the lord
[46:17] how many is the lord going to have to
[46:19] force you to be raptured
[46:25] let's see with a show of hands how many
[46:26] how many have to be forced
[46:31] one uno two those
[46:33] okay so now so now here here here's
[46:35] where the thought that the lord gave me
[46:37] right here okay
[46:40] okay so uh you know i don't have time to
[46:42] go out into all the background i've been
[46:43] here
[46:45] yes so so so we see a magnet right a
[46:48] magnet is is attracted to
[46:50] to to steel to iron
[47:05] aluminum is a metal that cannot be uh
[47:07] there's no attraction there aluminium
[47:10] so that's what i told the brothers there
[47:12] and uh
[47:13] in mexico is is is there there has to be
[47:16] an attraction there right
[47:21] there has to be an attraction and and
[47:34] okay so you get the negative side you
[47:35] try to put it to the metal
[47:49] to the positive side and it's going to
[47:50] stick well
[47:54] okay so here we so here on the verse
[47:57] seven we have the resistance right
[48:00] the resistance first day we have the
[48:02] attraction
[48:04] okay so so now there so now as we i
[48:07] always seem like we always talk about
[48:08] mountains right statue of a perfect man
[48:12] perfecto so so we have to climb that
[48:14] mountain right
[48:16] faith virtue knowledge say the patience
[48:18] temperance
[48:19] et cetera et cetera et cetera right
[48:23] right
[48:25] see
[48:26] yes okay so so then i i asked i asked
[48:28] the question
[48:29] i asked i told him that and i asked the
[48:31] question
[48:33] then
[48:34] what was the attraction
[48:36] on the mountain
[48:39] right brother brandon preached the
[48:41] message
[48:43] what is the attraction on the mountain
[48:46] now throughout all the bible we can see
[48:48] where where the holy spirit where god
[48:50] comes down right
[48:52] people say oh god doesn't descend the
[48:54] god doesn't come down
[48:57] absolutely there's plenty of examples in
[48:59] the bible where when god descends he
[49:01] descends to the top of the mountain
[49:07] amen amen okay so each and every one of
[49:10] us we have to also climb that mountain
[49:12] that statue of a perfect man
[49:14] question
[49:25] i ain't talking about drawing a piece a
[49:27] pitch or something either
[49:42] to cause to move in a given position or
[49:45] or a
[49:47] approach
[49:51] [Music]
[49:52] to cause a person or thing to move
[49:55] towards
[50:00] and i told them all well you know before
[50:02] me and my wife got married there was an
[50:03] attraction there right uh
[50:06] and i hope everybody has an attraction
[50:07] you know with their wives and stuff like
[50:08] that right
[50:11] there was attraction there i told them
[50:12] all her fair skin her blue eyes her
[50:15] brunette her hair
[50:17] there was an attraction
[50:21] there was an attraction there well for
[50:22] me there was an attraction
[50:24] for me so after church i would go and go
[50:26] talk to her because there was an
[50:27] attraction
[50:30] i'd be seeing the people and i was there
[50:32] checking her out
[50:37] right now she's probably like oh my god
[50:40] not again
[50:43] but but there was an attraction there
[50:44] right
[50:46] i was attracted to her
[50:49] and then of course there was there of
[50:50] course there was a mutual attraction
[50:52] there
[51:04] i would say like this me and just just
[51:07] in type so londipo and her being the
[51:09] bride of christ there was there was an
[51:11] attraction to her right
[51:14] attraction and and we being the bride of
[51:17] christ
[51:19] we have to be dressed right
[51:22] there has to be an attraction
[51:25] and not just because we preach good or
[51:27] we're related to the minister that
[51:29] doesn't that doesn't mean that the
[51:30] lord's going to come for us right
[51:35] it doesn't mean that we attract the lord
[51:37] no significance
[51:39] are you following me
[51:41] there's an attraction there because
[51:42] there's a lot of men of out of medals
[51:44] that are not attracted by the magnets
[51:48] okay right but there has to be an
[51:50] attraction
[51:53] and i told him there so so is it that
[51:55] the lord and i'm not finished with this
[51:56] brother
[51:59] is it that the lord is coming on his own
[52:04] or is there something that's inside of
[52:05] the bride of christ that's going to be
[52:07] drawing him
[52:10] in him
[52:12] amen because remember the spirit and the
[52:14] bride they come
[52:18] there's got to be something just like in
[52:20] my wi-fi there was something for in her
[52:22] that would draw me that would pull me
[52:27] do that that's what that's why the
[52:28] prophet preaches that message what is
[52:29] the attraction
[52:40] so just just like how that magnet comes
[52:42] and there's like that invisible force
[52:44] that that pools
[52:48] you can't see the force of the magnet
[52:50] when it's coming to the metal just
[52:53] a circle but the force is there
[52:56] amen amen
[52:59] amen with that if we get a chance i'll
[53:02] finish again a little bit later
[53:06] not that i'm asking to preach okay
[53:09] give my time to somebody else
[53:12] hey man but that's just a small little
[53:13] recap my time is done but god bless you
[53:15] all
[53:22] vermont
[53:39] thank you brother ronnie for
[54:00] you know every time we go on a trip um
[54:05] yeah
[54:06] it's such a good feeling to come back
[54:08] home
[54:13] to know that we accomplish what god has
[54:15] called us for
[54:20] founding pastors always taught us
[54:37] so when when we know that we're doing
[54:39] what god called us to god
[54:44] then we could i could look at you today
[54:46] and say congratulations
[54:51] to you that stay here and and toil and
[54:53] pray for for us when we go out in the
[54:56] field
[55:01] and stand behind the cause is
[55:06] we we know that god has god that's the
[55:08] reason god blesses this church
[55:13] amen it was such a privilege for me
[55:18] amen this is my first missionary trip
[55:20] back to from since covid
[55:27] and and many times when they go without
[55:29] me it's it's like a dagger in my heart
[55:40] but you know as we began to minister to
[55:42] the people
[55:45] you
[55:46] know a lot of times we don't realize how
[55:49] hungry the people are out there
[55:54] el pueblo and and the children of god
[55:56] are such a needy people
[56:00] puerto so when you go they they
[56:04] understand that we're bringing forth
[56:06] god's word
[56:10] and they know we have a purpose
[56:14] and they began just to
[56:29] i have never seen any of you preach that
[56:32] way
[56:36] you know i told brother hector we have a
[56:38] greater calling
[56:43] you know i remember our founding pastor
[56:45] told me once
[56:48] he said you're not going by yourself
[56:51] solo he says but
[56:54] i'm going with you
[56:56] and i always remember that
[56:59] because many times we may be preaching
[57:01] the gospel
[57:06] but before we know it the gospel is
[57:07] being made alive and right in front of
[57:10] us
[57:18] you know it's really tremendous
[57:21] tremendous what god does
[57:25] you know towards the end when brother
[57:26] caleb finished on sunday
[57:31] you know we had a lot of healing going
[57:33] on on saturday
[57:37] but on sunday they brought a
[57:38] demon-possessed girl that was
[57:40] possessed when she came to the front
[57:42] domino
[57:47] and brother our pastor began to to to
[57:50] talk to mr
[57:54] you know and she wouldn't look at him at
[57:56] all
[58:00] she she would push her his hand away
[58:05] and he said look at my eyes
[58:08] you know and many times it's not
[58:10] as easy as people think munches vessels
[58:15] but once he got down to the root of the
[58:17] problem
[58:20] our pastor was saying as he was leaving
[58:22] out the doors
[58:25] he almost didn't recognize her
[58:29] he handed her a bookmark
[58:34] and with a smile she looked in his eyes
[58:36] and accepted it
[58:40] you know so even if we just go for one
[58:42] soul
[58:43] obama
[58:44] you know it it's worth it all vale la
[58:47] pena you know what i i believe that that
[58:50] that the ministry that god has placed
[58:52] here
[58:56] it's a unique ministry
[59:00] i don't believe we we go into the world
[59:02] to try to get churches and put them
[59:03] under our pastures
[59:10] but we are there to help the people
[59:15] you know and that's what god's called us
[59:16] foreign
[59:19] so when you see and we see the power of
[59:21] god come down
[59:25] many many for many people
[59:29] it becomes common yeah said
[59:43] the message that god gave our prophets
[59:48] it's continuing church
[59:51] and you're the vessels that god has used
[59:53] in this last days
[59:58] that's powerful espo so you you know
[1:00:00] many times we forget
[1:00:03] where god's brought us from
[1:00:06] we forget all the work that's being done
[1:00:09] out there
[1:00:12] we stepped into this church almost 20
[1:00:14] years ago
[1:00:18] and so we go we we went to brother
[1:00:20] parker's church
[1:00:22] and just to see how hungry the people
[1:00:25] are
[1:00:25] very
[1:00:40] his vision was for the people to vision
[1:00:43] that was always his vision
[1:00:46] and to see this vision begin to be
[1:00:49] fulfilled
[1:00:54] i want to share something with you as i
[1:00:56] finish here
[1:00:59] i was preaching
[1:01:02] on the roar of the lion
[1:01:05] but god took me to joshua
[1:01:12] but i went to joshua 14.
[1:01:17] and the page was ripped out of my bible
[1:01:22] you know and and
[1:01:25] i know almost
[1:01:27] joshua 14 by heart
[1:01:33] didn't slow me down
[1:01:45] and it said there was no day
[1:01:48] like that before it or after it
[1:01:59] the children
[1:02:01] went
[1:02:01] into the promised land to spy out the
[1:02:03] land losing
[1:02:12] and there was 10 that brought back a bad
[1:02:14] report
[1:02:18] but joshua
[1:02:30] how great god is
[1:02:35] that it doesn't matter what happens
[1:02:39] if god promises you something
[1:02:42] and you stand behind the promise
[1:02:46] this
[1:03:27] caleb was already looking at the
[1:03:28] mountain del monte figuring out how he
[1:03:31] was going to take the mountain
[1:03:35] that's why they come back
[1:03:37] and here's joshua 40 years later or
[1:03:40] caleb forty years later akista caleb
[1:04:11] our founding pastor paved the way for us
[1:04:16] and we're just following him in his
[1:04:18] footsteps
[1:04:20] you know so all we could do is give all
[1:04:22] honor and glory to god's word
[1:04:40] you know we just preach and and
[1:04:42] and things happen
[1:04:46] brother hector hector you got to give
[1:04:48] your testimony to our church
[1:04:52] such a blessing that we had in his
[1:04:54] testimony
[1:04:58] god bless you
[1:05:01] i just want to thank our pastor for the
[1:05:03] opportunity that he
[1:05:04] gave each and every one of us to uh
[1:05:21] many love the lord jesus
[1:05:23] amen
[1:05:25] amen i just want to read a scripture
[1:05:27] real fast
[1:05:30] found in isaiah
[1:05:32] in 66 is
[1:05:40] this is thus saith the lord
[1:05:45] the heaven is my throne and the earth is
[1:05:47] my footstool
[1:06:04] amen
[1:06:06] so
[1:06:07] as we heard we
[1:06:08] we had a great trip
[1:06:14] [Music]
[1:06:16] and
[1:06:17] i had a brother caleb had asked me
[1:06:22] he had called me and asked me if i'd
[1:06:23] wanted to go to mexico
[1:06:28] and uh it had been uh actually i had
[1:06:30] made a mistake when i was there
[1:06:34] i said it had been 16 years since i had
[1:06:35] been to mexico city
[1:06:41] but it had been 16 years since i was in
[1:06:43] chihuahua
[1:06:53] so i really hadn't been out uh since uh
[1:06:57] you know like with the with the team
[1:07:23] just have some ailments that would cause
[1:07:25] me not to be able to make it you
[1:07:29] [Music]
[1:07:40] don't know give blame to the devil but i
[1:07:42] don't know what anyways um i got there
[1:07:45] and i was feeling really bad
[1:07:50] and so
[1:07:51] you know i began to get thoughts in my
[1:07:53] head like you know
[1:08:01] so we give credit to the devil but
[1:08:02] sometimes we create those things
[1:08:08] right see devil's not a creator
[1:08:12] right so he takes our word
[1:08:15] and he creates off of it so the question
[1:08:17] was asked if you know
[1:08:22] when one of the ministers was preaching
[1:08:23] or during the prayer line the question
[1:08:25] was asked do you believe
[1:08:32] or speak
[1:08:34] and believe your own word
[1:08:36] right and so a lot of times we speak the
[1:08:38] wrong thing
[1:08:41] and the devil believes our word
[1:08:44] believes
[1:08:46] hater
[1:08:48] he knows god's a creator
[1:08:51] and so in a way so i i was feeling
[1:08:53] really really bad
[1:08:56] and uh brother caleb prayed for me
[1:09:00] and uh god was graceful enough to and
[1:09:03] gracious enough to to heal me
[1:09:06] [Music]
[1:09:09] um so i mean i ended up you know getting
[1:09:11] a little sick
[1:09:15] but uh the question would be asked to
[1:09:17] myself
[1:09:23] right and so as brother ben was just
[1:09:24] talking right now
[1:09:27] when i and and before you know let me
[1:09:29] let me
[1:09:30] get off the subject cause then uh
[1:09:41] he was
[1:09:42] telling me about he was giving me a
[1:09:44] little
[1:09:45] pre-preview of his testimony
[1:09:49] and he started talking about the grace
[1:09:51] of god
[1:09:53] and the love of god
[1:09:55] and the grace of god in his life
[1:09:58] and he said that you know all i can see
[1:10:00] is grace
[1:10:06] i said you know
[1:10:07] i see something too
[1:10:12] you do
[1:10:14] see
[1:10:14] yes i see tears in your future
[1:10:20] yes he was giving me the testimony i
[1:10:22] said i see tears in your future
[1:10:27] i prophesied right there at that moment
[1:10:30] and i believe my own words
[1:10:33] and sure enough i saw tears
[1:10:38] so
[1:10:39] so
[1:10:40] you know so that's brother abraham he
[1:10:42] said i'm an abraham or built kind of
[1:10:44] alike
[1:10:48] so you know i thought was it worth it
[1:10:52] so now if you see tears in my future oh
[1:10:55] that's used
[1:11:06] because
[1:11:08] we saw some sick people healed the most
[1:11:13] but that sickness
[1:11:16] in this body will always come back
[1:11:21] or it can come back
[1:11:23] right because we know that this body of
[1:11:25] flashes
[1:11:29] but to see the soul
[1:11:37] to see the soul of this young girl
[1:11:43] i said i would
[1:11:44] and then the lord i said lord
[1:11:47] senor
[1:11:49] i want a scripture lord for
[1:11:51] hiring
[1:11:52] to give me the strength
[1:11:55] and he gave me psalms 27.
[1:11:58] it says the lord is my light and my
[1:12:00] salvation
[1:12:02] whom shall i fear see the lord is the
[1:12:05] strength of my life and of whom shall i
[1:12:09] be afraid
[1:12:10] when the wicked even mine enemies my
[1:12:12] foes
[1:12:14] came upon to eat up my flesh
[1:12:16] they stumbled and they fell
[1:12:20] here was
[1:12:34] and so yeah it was worth it
[1:12:38] i told the devil
[1:12:39] diablo i said you're gonna have to be
[1:12:41] one better than that
[1:12:45] because we're gonna finish the game
[1:13:12] and so i i right away i i you know i had
[1:13:15] some thoughts in my head
[1:13:19] and uh you know i have i'm i've been
[1:13:22] preaching now i think over
[1:13:26] about 32 years i think
[1:13:30] right
[1:13:44] i don't preach any other gospel
[1:13:47] i preached the message that was given to
[1:13:49] our apostles
[1:13:52] that he preached the message of our
[1:13:54] prophet william
[1:13:58] william and so i had thoughts that you
[1:14:00] know i could preach a two-hour message
[1:14:02] if you want me too
[1:14:06] but as i as i and i didn't expect to
[1:14:09] preach at all
[1:14:13] but right away on on the day that we
[1:14:15] were leaving i found out i was preaching
[1:14:16] the next day
[1:14:23] and so
[1:14:24] when i heard the theme
[1:14:40] but it's always like we're looking in
[1:14:41] the future
[1:14:44] and so
[1:14:46] everybody
[1:14:47] you know that
[1:14:48] everybody claims to believe the message
[1:14:53] they all claim to believe a prophet
[1:14:58] they all believe to have believed an
[1:15:00] apostle
[1:15:04] but you always find them like wandering
[1:15:06] wandering circles but
[1:15:13] and so it's like brother branham says
[1:15:15] that we're always looking to what god's
[1:15:16] done
[1:15:22] to what he's gonna do
[1:15:24] but what we fail to do is see what he's
[1:15:26] doing right now
[1:15:30] and so i was going to hit that the lord
[1:15:31] cometh
[1:15:51] and so where i went to this on the flea
[1:15:54] was behold the bridegroom cometh
[1:15:59] out to meet him
[1:16:01] and so
[1:16:03] god only has one place where he meets
[1:16:05] the worshiper
[1:16:11] god doesn't choose a lot of places to
[1:16:13] put his name
[1:16:31] if you don't come to my church you know
[1:16:32] god doesn't
[1:16:45] so it's always drawing himself back to
[1:16:47] himself
[1:16:50] so if somebody says well the holy ghost
[1:16:52] leads me
[1:16:53] saying
[1:16:55] the holy ghost is always going to lead
[1:16:56] you back to himself
[1:17:01] right so brother brown says that the
[1:17:03] holy ghost
[1:17:06] is not going to make somebody act one
[1:17:07] way
[1:17:10] and another person
[1:17:14] and so just to get to the end of it
[1:17:18] god has a meeting place
[1:17:21] and he has a law eating really and so
[1:17:24] today we got to find we got to realize
[1:17:28] that we're
[1:17:34] [Music]
[1:17:54] so there's a law that god has is
[1:17:58] tieni and i i i hit this i didn't know
[1:18:01] why i hit it
[1:18:04] but god has a law for everything
[1:18:08] and so
[1:18:09] we always tend to
[1:18:12] you know dive into the law
[1:18:18] of blessing and physical healing and
[1:18:21] medicine is physical right everybody
[1:18:24] wants god's blessings
[1:18:28] everybody wants to feel real good in
[1:18:29] their bodies they don't want to be
[1:18:32] right nobody wants them nobody wants to
[1:18:34] be sick or suffering
[1:18:36] and so we really go after those laws
[1:18:38] enthusiasm
[1:18:51] right and i'll pour out a blessing upon
[1:18:53] you that you can't contain
[1:18:56] this
[1:18:58] and everybody taps into that law
[1:19:02] christian or non-christian
[1:19:05] i used to work for a man in silver city
[1:19:07] a businessman
[1:19:11] he never went to church
[1:19:13] but he would pay his tithe and offerings
[1:19:15] to his church all i mean in in bundles
[1:19:19] is
[1:20:00] oh man you can get lost in the forest
[1:20:02] real fast
[1:20:05] because you'll i mean people will quote
[1:20:07] brother branham
[1:20:10] oh
[1:20:11] message of brother tommy
[1:20:15] right and they have a spiritual sickness
[1:20:17] in their heart
[1:20:20] and
[1:20:21] and so they try to
[1:20:23] fix that on their own
[1:20:28] man i wish i could give two examples
[1:20:30] because time would go real fast
[1:20:34] is brother gonna give a testimony
[1:20:37] no
[1:20:38] he's not not sunday or nothing
[1:20:41] no okay
[1:20:43] so he brought up this thing real quick
[1:20:47] two examples
[1:20:49] david david
[1:20:51] and samson
[1:20:53] right david
[1:20:56] david and samson
[1:20:58] they pretty much did the same kind of
[1:21:00] things
[1:21:01] [Music]
[1:21:02] right
[1:21:03] so they pretty much had like a heart a
[1:21:05] sickness in their hearts
[1:21:10] i just didn't want to steal a brother
[1:21:11] minus thunder that's why it's not
[1:21:24] when david found out he had something in
[1:21:26] his heart
[1:21:29] he ran straight to the prophet
[1:21:33] right
[1:21:34] he ran straight to the source where god
[1:21:37] had chosen to place his name
[1:21:53] he didn't have that opportunity to go
[1:21:57] so he did it in solitude by himself
[1:22:02] and he lost his life
[1:22:04] right so god has a place
[1:22:15] and that's that he has placed a ministry
[1:22:17] jesus
[1:22:19] and that's where that healing comes it
[1:22:21] comes in the place where god has put his
[1:22:22] name
[1:22:27] and that's where people don't want to go
[1:22:29] to the meeting place
[1:22:33] everybody wants to meet jesus
[1:22:38] man but
[1:22:40] they don't want to go to where jesus is
[1:22:41] at
[1:22:45] so
[1:22:46] and i say this for reasons
[1:22:50] like i said everything that we say and
[1:22:52] we hear
[1:22:56] a spirit behind them
[1:22:58] so being in the spiritual warfare
[1:23:04] it's called what what becomes the silent
[1:23:07] okay
[1:23:08] it's the silent okay
[1:23:12] right you see that at work
[1:23:14] you see a guy do something
[1:23:17] that's not the procedure for doing it
[1:23:21] right but you don't say nothing
[1:23:24] right so then it just becomes a silent
[1:23:26] okay
[1:23:28] okay
[1:23:29] but you know that it's wrong
[1:23:32] he knows it's wrong
[1:23:34] everybody knows when they do something
[1:23:36] wrong right
[1:23:38] so that person he he he's going to do
[1:23:40] something
[1:23:42] and then he like oh shoot that's not the
[1:23:44] reason to do it
[1:24:00] so then a little later it gets a little
[1:24:02] bigger thing
[1:24:05] and then before you know it
[1:24:07] the whole thing's all changed around
[1:24:11] but god wants to bring you back to his
[1:24:13] word
[1:24:14] regret
[1:24:20] which the bible says know ye not that
[1:24:22] you are the temple of the lord
[1:24:28] [Applause]
[1:24:55] basically what i'm going to talk about
[1:24:56] is what i saw happen in general
[1:25:03] it covers a lot
[1:25:06] in a few words
[1:25:08] by the grace of god
[1:25:10] like
[1:25:19] [Music]
[1:25:28] the word of the lord
[1:25:30] that came to joel
[1:25:34] hold on let me get it on my tablet
[1:25:37] the word of the lord that came into
[1:25:38] dwell
[1:26:07] have this been in your days
[1:26:12] or even in the days of your father's
[1:26:15] buenos dias
[1:26:17] plural
[1:26:20] tell your children of it
[1:26:27] and let your children tell
[1:26:29] their children
[1:26:33] and their children another generation
[1:26:39] what the palmer worm left
[1:26:43] the locust
[1:26:46] and that which the locusts have left
[1:26:48] half the cankle worm eaten
[1:26:53] and that which the cankerworm had left
[1:26:55] had the caterpillar eaten
[1:27:08] what i saw in these meetings
[1:27:14] is the totality of what this scripture
[1:27:16] declares
[1:27:42] well maybe some of you could answer and
[1:27:44] say right out of the gate yes
[1:27:51] if you're speaking about your natural
[1:27:53] fathers
[1:27:57] some of the families we have here have a
[1:27:59] privilege of
[1:28:00] a lineage in the message
[1:28:06] to me i was one born out of due season
[1:28:11] foreign
[1:28:25] religious background
[1:28:32] i was born
[1:28:35] i was raised in the baptist church
[1:28:39] but
[1:28:40] god called me out of there
[1:28:44] because they were bad people nope
[1:28:48] but because they only went so far with
[1:28:50] god
[1:28:53] so i can't answer that question like
[1:28:55] maybe some of you can
[1:28:57] contest
[1:29:01] but has this been in your days
[1:29:05] not as plural
[1:29:08] or the days of your fathers
[1:29:12] now now this scripture's compound
[1:29:18] which means it can mean two
[1:29:20] or more things
[1:29:27] so now if we apply this to the spiritual
[1:29:29] or
[1:29:31] spiritual has this been in your days
[1:29:36] i'm living in my day now just
[1:29:41] or has it been in the days of my
[1:29:42] father's
[1:29:44] day
[1:29:45] has it been in the days of juan
[1:29:47] francisco flaccio
[1:29:49] juan francisco my first
[1:29:59] who sent me to brother tommy
[1:30:02] amen amen
[1:30:21] i see all these different generations of
[1:30:23] people
[1:30:26] and how
[1:30:27] this message has been transferred from
[1:30:30] one to the other it comes
[1:31:00] me
[1:31:02] you know what i told the devil like
[1:31:05] thank you devil
[1:31:07] i needed a good cleaning out anyway
[1:31:11] yeah you said why would you get thanks
[1:31:12] to the devil well it's not that energy
[1:31:28] to fight against
[1:31:41] i wanted to be something be there
[1:31:43] something horrible i mean i wanted to be
[1:31:45] there so bad
[1:31:48] and everybody that went on the trip says
[1:31:49] well we know why because you were
[1:31:50] supposed to get the teaching in the
[1:31:52] morning
[1:31:53] before the regular services
[1:32:11] i i got to watch my pastor online as
[1:32:13] they give the teaching
[1:32:15] pastor
[1:32:18] but then i see this next part
[1:32:22] now that i've seen it was in the days of
[1:32:23] my father's and it's
[1:32:48] this testimony is incredible
[1:32:50] testimonials
[1:32:51] and you say yeah belgium because you're
[1:32:53] in it
[1:32:56] god god just gave me their privilege
[1:32:59] why did they sit there and ball like a
[1:33:01] little baby
[1:33:05] because just to know i have a little
[1:33:08] part
[1:33:10] in god's plan
[1:33:15] i couldn't handle that no no no
[1:33:18] i was just so
[1:33:20] thankful boy he's got a part of his
[1:33:23] testimony like like the brother said
[1:33:25] we got to hear the whole testimony of
[1:33:27] brother hatred
[1:33:33] let your children tell their children
[1:33:37] and their children then can tell another
[1:33:40] generation
[1:33:43] this message will never die
[1:33:46] now notice here's what as i take about
[1:33:49] another seven or eight minutes
[1:33:53] because i'm watching the clock
[1:33:56] what the palmer worm had
[1:33:59] left
[1:34:41] takes away the nine fruits of the spirit
[1:34:43] you can read in the bible
[1:34:47] it takes away the fruit of the tree
[1:34:54] and then that would with the locust
[1:34:56] stage
[1:34:59] [Music]
[1:35:12] many of you should know this one by
[1:35:13] heart
[1:35:15] the leaves on the tree represent okay
[1:35:20] let's say it together
[1:35:22] divine
[1:35:26] fellowship
[1:35:39] the wind of the holy ghost can blow
[1:35:49] in the presence and in the freshness of
[1:35:52] the holy spirit
[1:35:57] notice how he ate the fruit first
[1:36:05] the spirit of antichrist
[1:36:08] through the church ages
[1:36:11] then what the locusts ate
[1:36:16] canker worm eaten
[1:36:20] in english i know it doesn't translate
[1:36:22] the same in spanish
[1:36:28] it's a ugly name to begin with
[1:36:32] because what are we going to call this
[1:36:34] guy
[1:36:36] he goes why
[1:36:49] and he
[1:36:50] it's the lifeline that he's taking out
[1:36:53] yes
[1:36:57] the bark that's covered is the carbon is
[1:37:00] the religion
[1:37:19] just a a written thing on a piece of
[1:37:21] paper
[1:37:24] but it keeps the spirit of god
[1:37:27] in the words that use in la palabra to
[1:37:29] make that word produce what it says
[1:37:32] it'll produce
[1:38:01] is the nomination it's what breaks up
[1:38:03] the brotherhood it's separate from
[1:38:05] people now
[1:38:06] thousand denominations
[1:38:10] and they think the lord's coming for
[1:38:12] that a church like that
[1:38:14] you'll be it
[1:38:40] [Music]
[1:38:51] and that which the canker worm has left
[1:38:54] has the caterpillar eaten
[1:39:13] a caterpillar sucked it out
[1:39:21] and the organization
[1:39:23] take took it out
[1:39:39] una la sacca and the other one gets rid
[1:39:41] of it
[1:39:42] gets rid of it
[1:39:46] but what i saw on this trip
[1:39:49] in the generation of ronnie and jerry
[1:39:52] wrong
[1:40:05] is
[1:40:19] and he loves the lord yeah
[1:40:32] that's what i saw on this trip
[1:41:44] jesus christ the same yesterday today
[1:41:46] and forever
[1:41:49] end of the transformation
[1:41:52] that great prophet elijah to appear on
[1:41:54] the scene
[1:41:57] remember he had a compound
[1:42:23] the new message
[1:42:54] [Music]
[1:43:08] from the time of
[1:43:21] can you say that with me
[1:43:24] he will restore all the years
[1:43:37] brother danny how many years does that
[1:43:39] include
