[10:48] house of the Lord this
[10:50] evening first of all I would like to
[10:53] thank our precious Lord Jesus Christ for
[10:55] giving me life to serve him and our
[10:58] pastor brother for giving me an
[11:00] opportunity to share a little something
[11:02] with you
[11:03] guys if you would all turn in your
[11:06] Bibles to
[11:08] Isaiah 40 verse 28-
[11:19] 31 hast thou not known hast thou not Hur
[11:24] that the Everlasting God the Lord the
[11:28] creator of the ends of the Earth Fain
[11:32] not neither is he
[11:35] weary there is no searching of his
[11:38] understanding he giveth power to the
[11:41] faint and to them that have no might he
[11:45] increases strength even the youth shall
[11:49] faint and be weary and the young men
[11:52] shall utterly fall but they that wait
[11:56] upon the Lord shall renew their strength
[11:59] they shall Mount up with wings as eagles
[12:03] they shall
[12:04] run and not be weary and they shall walk
[12:07] and not
[12:09] faint if you would all bow your heads
[12:12] for a word of prayer de Lord Jesus
[12:15] Christ Lord Our Father who are in heaven
[12:18] Hallowed be thy name thy kingdom come
[12:22] thy will be done on Earth as it is in
[12:26] heaven give us this day our daily bread
[12:30] and forgive our trespasses as we forgive
[12:34] those who trespass against us and lead
[12:38] us not into temptation but Deliver Us
[12:41] from Evil for thine is the kingdom and
[12:45] the power and the glory forever and ever
[12:48] amen you may be
[12:53] seated the title of a message is called
[12:56] Fearless as an eagle
[12:59] when I was when I was in my bed hearing
[13:02] the audio of the supernatural life of
[13:04] brother brandham I came across a story
[13:06] that really blessed me andless that
[13:09] brother brandom he was in the wilderness
[13:12] enjoying nature but there was this girl
[13:14] that was making a big fuss was making
[13:16] all sorts of
[13:18] noises but R watch the squirr hey what
[13:21] are you so excited
[13:23] about well brother bam realized that
[13:26] squirrel wasn't excited it was scared
[13:29] cuz he saw an because brother bham Saw
[13:32] an Eagle resting on a
[13:34] stump brother bam wanted to see the
[13:37] reaction of the eagle so he got his rle
[13:39] and pointed it at the Eagle guess what
[13:42] deagle did deagle did not do anything he
[13:46] just looked at brother
[13:47] brandom then brother brandom told the
[13:50] eagle hey fella aren't you scared of me
[13:53] you know I could kill you but still that
[13:55] eagle did not budge you just stay there
[13:57] looking at brother r
[14:00] brother bam became to wonder why is this
[14:04] Eagle not scared of
[14:06] me but then he realized that Daddy got
[14:10] God gave that eagle two powerful wings
[14:12] that as someone tries to shoot that
[14:15] eagle that eagle will be gone in two
[14:20] flaps now how many kids here are afraid
[14:23] of something and they want to share it
[14:30] nobody well we have some Brave kids
[14:33] here that's a good one you're scared of
[14:36] spiders now one from the
[14:40] girls no nothing okay there's we got
[14:43] Brave Girls
[14:45] here
[14:48] Isaiah another one
[14:51] spiders now if God gave the eagle two
[14:55] power of wings to take himself out of
[14:57] danger what has he given
[15:00] us well God has given us many things and
[15:04] to me two of them are the word of God on
[15:09] prayer
[15:11] amen now let's get deeper into the life
[15:13] of an
[15:15] eagle as soon as the little iglet grow
[15:18] feathers their mama starts to shake the
[15:21] nest she says kids it's time to face
[15:24] your fears so she shakes that Nest real
[15:27] hard and down go leg start falling and
[15:31] falling and they start yelling mama no
[15:34] please help us we don't know how to do
[15:36] this but they do that realizing that all
[15:39] they have to do is just flap those
[15:41] swings and
[15:43] fly so there goes the Momo she comes
[15:46] down and picks him back
[15:49] up after that she does that to teach him
[15:53] a lesson she says kids I'm going to do
[15:59] do that until you guys know that all you
[16:01] have to do is just flap those
[16:04] swings and eventually those eaglets
[16:08] realize that they won't die all they
[16:11] have to do is just flap those
[16:14] wings
[16:16] amen the Bible says in Joel 3:10 let the
[16:20] weak say I am strong amen could you
[16:23] repeat it with me yes let the weak let
[16:26] the weak say I am strong say I am
[16:29] WR come on guys I I heard your boys
[16:32] yelling outside I've heard your girls
[16:33] screaming outside you can do better than
[16:36] this again let the weak let the weak say
[16:40] I am strong say I am strong now that's
[16:46] better so please if the Lord tells you
[16:49] to do something do it because he won't
[16:53] leave you until you fulfill his
[16:57] purpose and as the Eagle girls they
[17:00] don't like to be in no places so when
[17:03] they're ready to fly but there's a storm
[17:06] they don't chicken out and say oh no the
[17:08] clouds are too dark I better stay here
[17:10] or maybe no it's just too windy I I'm
[17:13] going to stay here I don't want to break
[17:14] my wings no that eagle goes up to the
[17:17] storm and says you don't scare me and he
[17:20] flaps those wings and he overcomes the
[17:24] storm did you guys know that the eagle
[17:27] uses the wind the storm's Own Wind to
[17:31] pull himself
[17:37] higher God has given us powerful tools
[17:41] and some of them are the word of God and
[17:44] prayer so maybe when you're afraid and
[17:47] your mom tells you to go turn off the
[17:49] lights in the kitchen and you don't want
[17:50] to do it cuz you're scared or maybe you
[17:53] want to sing or testify in church but
[17:55] you don't want to do it cuz you're
[17:57] afraid my recommendation to you is flap
[18:01] those wings confess that you're a child
[18:03] of God and if you only know one verse of
[18:06] the Bible say it over and over and over
[18:08] again until you realize that the demon
[18:11] called being scared of the dark is gone
[18:15] or that demon that tells you oh don't
[18:16] sing in church cuz you're going to make
[18:18] mistakes or the demon that tells you
[18:20] don't testify in church cuz people will
[18:22] laugh at
[18:24] you now this is what brother bam says in
[18:27] the message expectations
[18:29] and I thought if God gave the eagle two
[18:33] Wings to take himself out of danger and
[18:35] he has down much trust in his wings what
[18:39] are a church that's baptized with the
[18:41] Holy Ghost do see there he was moving
[18:45] his feathers I thought yeah as long as
[18:49] he can feel them Wings they're all right
[18:52] he ain't scared of nothing and I said
[18:55] praise God as long as I can feel the
[18:57] Holy Spirit moving
[18:59] Devils can't scare nothing that's right
[19:02] when the holy spirits
[19:06] around I want to share with you guys a
[19:09] little testimony about how the Lord
[19:12] helped me overcome my
[19:13] fears I remember when I was younger I
[19:16] used to be really really
[19:18] shy so the Lord put something in my
[19:20] heart that I wanted to play that
[19:24] piano so I said and then I decided I
[19:28] wanted to play piano Chanel so as time
[19:30] went on I decided that I really wanted
[19:33] to play a special for the
[19:35] Lord so I got everything ready and I
[19:38] came up
[19:40] here and
[19:42] then I saw some obstacles my leg was all
[19:45] the way down there trying to reach the
[19:47] fed and then my hands R here trying to
[19:49] look at the piano and try to play
[19:51] piano and then fear came in and said oh
[19:55] well you're going to make some mistakes
[19:57] and guess what I didn't make one mistake
[20:00] I made a ton of
[20:03] [Applause]
[20:05] them so then I decided I was going to
[20:08] try again and on the second time guess
[20:11] what happened nothing I played the Lord
[20:15] I played for the Lord and I didn't make
[20:17] make any mistakes cuz the Lord helped me
[20:20] overcome my fears and I ended up having
[20:22] more fun then I honestly just forgot
[20:26] that I was being scared
[20:29] and then I decided after that one I was
[20:31] going to do another one and the second
[20:34] one was still pretty
[20:36] terrifying but then the third one it
[20:38] wasn't so bad and just kept on going to
[20:41] the point that every time that I go up
[20:43] here to play a
[20:45] piano the and the Devil comes in tes to
[20:48] and tries to tell me oh well you're
[20:50] going to make some mistakes I tell him
[20:52] oh come on devil it's too late I've
[20:55] already got usess in my heart
[21:00] so I tell him to get his dirty lives and
[21:02] get out of
[21:03] here and then I enjoy playing for the
[21:07] Lord and before I let you guys
[21:10] go I want I want to tell you guys a
[21:13] little quote about what brother benam
[21:15] says
[21:16] about and now he said say fellow are you
[21:20] scared of me he just sat there and
[21:22] looked at me and I thought oh I
[21:26] see God you want me to see that eagle
[21:29] because he's Brave that's what it is God
[21:32] don't want cupboards God wants brave
[21:35] men are remember little

[23:09] this evening you just help
[23:12] me if um if you could please
[23:17] stand and uh we'll
[23:22] uh you kids willing to help me
[23:25] out no okay
[23:30] God one is willing to help me out okay
[23:31] who all brought their
[23:36] Bibles okay so first one that can find
[23:39] me First John 4:4
[24:10] 44 ye are of God little children and
[24:14] have overcome them because greater is he
[24:17] that is in you that he is in the world
[24:23] Amen man greater is he that is in you
[24:26] than he that is in the world but what
[24:28] catches my attention the most it says
[24:30] that little children that ye are of
[24:34] God how many believe that okay so the
[24:37] second scripture is first John
[24:41] 2:28 really close to each
[24:53] other and now little children abide in
[24:56] him that he shall here we may have
[25:00] confidence and not be ashamed before him
[25:03] at his
[25:06] coming amen that the little children
[25:08] should abide in him you may be
[25:11] seated this evening I just want to want
[25:15] to speak of two different Kings the Old
[25:18] Testament and the kings of Kings of
[25:21] Israel how many know the story of King
[25:25] manasse not a very known name how many
[25:28] know King
[25:31] Josiah okay so two of us know what King
[25:33] Josiah is
[25:34] okay well to start off with Manasseh
[25:38] they were both really young
[25:40] kings manasseh's dad was King Hezekiah
[25:43] who knows about King
[25:46] Hezekiah well King Hezekiah was a a very
[25:50] very good man in the Lord and and the
[25:53] Lord blessed him because the Kings
[25:55] before him had destroyed the church or
[25:57] the or or the house House of God and
[25:59] Hezekiah came and restored it and made
[26:01] the people serve the Lord well after
[26:03] Hezekiah got older and he passed away
[26:06] his son came his name was King
[26:10] manasse how many know how old King
[26:12] Manasseh
[26:14] was any of the
[26:17] adults 12 he was 12 years so is who here
[26:21] is 12 years
[26:23] old of the
[26:26] young nobody told years old come here
[26:30] Paul you mind help me
[26:35] out so we all know that brother Paul
[26:38] here is not an evil
[26:42] person not that we know
[26:45] of but King manasse was Paul's age
[26:49] whenever his father died and he had to
[26:51] be
[26:52] king so can you stand
[26:56] there lost my spot there
[26:59] okay so his father very great very great
[27:05] king how old are you 12 okay so he was
[27:08] 12 years
[27:09] old so King Manasseh under the influence
[27:13] of his father and those around him
[27:15] should have been a great King
[27:17] right well the Bible says that King
[27:20] Manasseh was one of the one of the most
[27:22] evil Kings for the first part of his
[27:25] life that he did that which was wrong
[27:28] now we know Paul didn't do that Paul is
[27:30] a very good very good person I hope I
[27:35] know we know
[27:36] that so
[27:39] um so he was 12 years
[27:42] old so how was it that Manasseh was such
[27:44] an evil King how did he become such an
[27:47] evil King if his father was so
[27:52] great because of
[27:55] what he was young right so maybe maybe
[27:58] those around him had influenced him and
[28:00] told him your father was he was awesome
[28:04] great
[28:05] king so you don't have to be as
[28:08] great God will bless you because your
[28:10] father was he was a good King made the
[28:13] people serve the Lord well maybe manasse
[28:18] took after that saw what the other
[28:20] kingdoms were doing and he decided to
[28:23] follow after other
[28:25] gods and turn away from the Lord
[28:29] maybe he stopped going to church put up
[28:32] idol and this leads me to my next
[28:34] scripture first John 5:21 whoever finds
[28:41] it here yes just a little
[28:45] longer
[28:49] 521 no you know what it's okay you can
[28:51] sit down thank brother Paul for coming
[28:54] and helping me up
[28:55] here 521
[29:08] yes we'll let you read it it's
[29:11] okay 1 John
[29:15] 5:21
[29:21] 521 first John 521
[29:30] here okay let's see we'll get you to
[29:33] read the next
[29:34] one first John
[29:37] yeah little children keep your SL selves
[29:42] keep yourselves s from Idols Idols
[29:47] amen so a simple scripture it says
[29:49] little children keep yourselves from
[29:52] Idols now how many know what an idol
[29:55] is Elijah
[30:07] yes yes they were they were
[30:10] statues and what and what brother Elijah
[30:12] said it's any an idol is anything you
[30:15] worship or you put above God which is
[30:18] very evil so the Lord was very angry at
[30:21] King
[30:23] Manassa
[30:24] and after manasse it says the Bible said
[30:27] that he was worth wor than the
[30:29] world so in a pretty bad spot being that
[30:32] he came from a from a from a very good
[30:35] from a very good place in the
[30:38] Lord so you know what happened to King
[30:42] manasse he was
[30:48] taking he was taken he was taken captive
[30:51] he was taken other kings came other
[30:54] Kingdom came and and and uh destroyed
[30:57] the kingdom and took him captive took
[30:58] him to jail
[31:00] basically and it says that there is
[31:02] where he found the Lord and and um says
[31:06] here that he would he humbled himself
[31:09] said he humbled himself and God came
[31:12] down and and restored well didn't really
[31:14] restore his kingdom but brought him back
[31:15] to his kingdom and King Manassa
[31:18] repented and uh he was already older he
[31:21] wasn't as a child as 12 years old and
[31:24] that's where he made his mistake as a
[31:25] child he did not believe in God God so
[31:28] as he he went on he passed away his son
[31:33] came and was a horrible horrible King
[31:35] also he didn't he didn't live but two
[31:39] years in the as king and and he was and
[31:42] he was killed but then comes this other
[31:45] King Josiah how many know how how old
[31:48] Josiah was when he became he was 8 years
[31:51] old
[31:55] now who here is eight years old
[32:01] you want come help
[32:05] me so let's say this is King
[32:10] Josiah and
[32:12] um he uh the Bible says what he did 2
[32:16] Chronicles
[32:24] 34:2 mind standing up here for a little
[32:26] bit okay
[32:30] than 2 Chronicles
[32:35] 34:2 none the ladies have their
[32:40] Bibles
[32:51] okay Lord and walked in the ways of his
[32:54] father David he did not turn aside to
[32:56] the right hand or to the
[32:59] left wow so King Josiah from a young
[33:04] age found the Lord but his his father
[33:08] and I believe his grandfather were very
[33:10] evil so how was it that Josiah was able
[33:13] to find the Lord at such a young
[33:16] age tell us brother Josiah how did you
[33:20] find the
[33:22] Lord you the Josiah
[33:27] I don't know he doesn't know that's
[33:31] okay so and the Bible doesn't say
[33:34] but maybe Josiah had looked at the
[33:37] stories of old maybe he thought of
[33:41] Moses and how the Lord blessed him maybe
[33:43] he thought of of King
[33:46] Hezekiah and how the Lord was great with
[33:48] him so maybe Josiah
[33:51] decided I'm going to Worship the Lord
[33:54] and I'm going to do the best I can to
[33:55] serve him so you can go sit down thanks
[33:58] brother Isaiah so he decided to Worship
[34:01] the
[34:03] Lord and the Lord blessed him greatly
[34:06] because as a child he decided to follow
[34:09] the lord it says here that at in a young
[34:11] age he did that which was right he
[34:14] started so
[34:16] um Josiah was influenced greatly Maybe
[34:19] by his mother maybe by the priest and he
[34:23] would he took um he was obedient to the
[34:27] word I believe
[34:30] so Josiah began to look deeper and
[34:32] deeper into God's love and in his word
[34:35] and and found himself a great king
[34:38] powerful
[34:39] King and he did that which was right in
[34:42] the
[34:43] Lord so what was the difference what was
[34:46] the difference between the two kings who
[34:48] was the good
[34:51] King
[34:53] Asia Josiah was the good King and why
[34:56] was he a good King
[35:01] he found the Lord at a very young age
[35:03] and that's right what was Manassa why
[35:05] did Manassa
[35:11] fail true and because he decided that he
[35:16] wasn't going to follow the lord at a
[35:17] young age right because he thought his
[35:19] father did it good enough for
[35:23] him so I have another
[35:26] story um
[35:28] it's not in the Bible but who knows the
[35:30] story of Dwight
[35:35] Moody brother Caleb knows the story he's
[35:38] not brother brandom speaks of him a lot
[35:41] and the and the story of Dwight Moody to
[35:43] me is very is a it's very uh it's an
[35:47] awesome story because he he also found
[35:50] the Lord at at a very young age brother
[35:53] brandom said that there was an old wash
[35:54] woman that she was I believe it was it
[35:57] was clothes that she washed and um she
[36:00] was there and and uh she wanted she had
[36:04] on her heart to do something for the
[36:05] Lord so she decided that she was going
[36:08] to rent she was going to rent a stable
[36:11] quick question who knows what other
[36:12] marvelous story in the Bible happened in
[36:14] a
[36:16] stable Mary and Joseph and the birth of
[36:19] Jesus Christ that's right so she rented
[36:22] us she rented this Stable horses and she
[36:25] cleaned it up
[36:27] and then so she starts inviting people
[36:30] come on we're going to have a Revival
[36:31] this evening through the week it's going
[36:33] to be good she gives people this
[36:36] paper she gives people this paper I got
[36:44] here or three
[36:46] people and um they would read it they
[36:50] would take it C
[36:52] see and they saw that it was going to be
[36:55] done in a stable and they threw it on
[36:58] the floor and walked
[37:00] off because brother bradam says it
[37:03] wasn't fancy enough for them so that the
[37:05] rest people so the wash woman felt very
[37:08] horrible she felt like she had done
[37:09] nothing for the Lord so time comes the
[37:14] preacher's there washwoman is there and
[37:17] um earlier that day she had she had she
[37:20] had met this young boy and came up to
[37:21] her and
[37:22] said well what are you doing what what's
[37:24] that you got and she says well we're
[37:27] having having a meeting this evening and
[37:29] uh she says here take one he says well I
[37:32] can't read but but um but what's going
[37:35] on she said well we're having a Revival
[37:37] and um it's going to be good so he says
[37:40] okay he takes one he continues on his
[37:44] way and as he starts and as the as the
[37:47] preacher starts brother brandham says
[37:50] that a small raggedy hair boy walks in
[37:53] through the
[37:54] door he said he was just a little boy
[37:56] and he came and his daddy's clothes cuz
[37:59] he was very poor and so that from there
[38:01] is where he found Jesus it was just the
[38:03] wash woman and the little boy and the
[38:05] preacher in his
[38:08] stable so uh brother Dwight Moody he
[38:12] went on to save millions of souls what
[38:14] brother brandham says he was a great man
[38:16] of God brother brandham uses him a lot
[38:19] so we understand that you have to know
[38:22] God from a very young age and believe in
[38:25] him with all your heart you're are going
[38:27] to succeed in life is that right
[38:30] amen
[38:33] so
[38:38] um well I thought my notes were going to
[38:40] go longer but I guess
[38:43] not so what was something that you
[38:46] learned
[38:49] brother
[38:51] brother
[38:54] Andress that's heard God and what's the
[38:57] best time to
[39:01] start any
[39:03] time right now is the best time to start
[39:06] serving the lord
[39:08] amen is that
[39:11] a so
[39:14] um I uh I've been in church all my life
[39:17] and um and I um and the Lord's been good
[39:21] but this past year just quick testimony
[39:25] before I finish I had a
[39:28] I had a deer hunt how many like to hunt
[39:30] a little wow a lot more than I thought
[39:33] that's good it's
[39:35] awesome and um I had heard that there
[39:38] was going to be a lot of deer it was
[39:41] going to be an easy hunt and uh so I
[39:44] beli that so I started walking and we
[39:47] were looking for the deer and we could
[39:50] um and there was no deer to be found as
[39:52] we so I became
[39:55] discouraged I walked Dad we walked up up
[39:57] and down mountains and
[39:59] nothing so as we were walking down we
[40:02] began to talk about Jesus and what he
[40:07] does we began to began to look at the
[40:11] stories of old and he said well brother
[40:15] Mark had a had a story of where u a
[40:19] wonderful hunting story where where God
[40:21] had provided him a an elk is brother
[40:23] Mark
[40:25] here is that true brother Mark
[40:28] so I said well well if that could happen
[40:31] to brother Mark well it's got to happen
[40:32] to me
[40:33] too so we started going and I
[40:38] prayed and then ideas started coming
[40:41] well happened to brother Mark but how
[40:43] could it happen to you you're just you
[40:46] just you know you're not you're not like
[40:48] brother Mark so it kept going but I
[40:51] prayed and I believed that there was
[40:54] going to be a deer for me so I expected
[40:57] it to pop out of
[41:01] nowhere and it
[41:03] didn't but it it was Thanksgiving day
[41:06] and I decided Well I didn't decide to
[41:09] eat I mean I kind of had to eat and um
[41:11] there Thanksgiving and prayed I said
[41:14] Lord I don't know where to go we don't
[41:16] know where to go can't find anything but
[41:19] if you just lead us to it Lord we'll be
[41:21] ready so finished started eating eating
[41:24] canned ham which doesn't taste like ham
[41:27] am but it's pretty
[41:30] good so
[41:32] um and we hear these side by sides
[41:35] coming
[41:36] four-wheelers and um and there were two
[41:40] strangers never never met didn't know
[41:42] their names he
[41:44] says we know that you guys are hunting
[41:46] deer and we want to take you to where
[41:48] the deer are so you can shoot a deer so
[41:52] we go the first day and uh and we SE
[41:56] some but we but we weren't able to get
[41:58] it that day so so I was discouraged
[42:02] again but I said you know you know the
[42:06] Lord is good and and I love him with all
[42:09] my heart and I have since a young age so
[42:11] we go the next day and the Lord provides
[42:13] a deer for
[42:14] us and uh it was just it was good
[42:18] because you don't have to be any older
[42:21] in what you are especially the children
[42:24] to know that God is he's real and he's
[42:26] able he wants to help you that ye are of
[42:29] God and greater is he that is in you
[42:33] than he that is in the
[42:34] world so um just just remember that and
[42:38] to love God in your young age and to
[42:41] keep him as you grow and I don't have
[42:42] anything else it was kind of short but
[42:45] uh pray that God bless you and that that
[42:47] you continue have a good day God bless
[42:49] you
[42:50] [Applause]
[43:10] would you please
[43:12] stand and I believe that the Lord the
