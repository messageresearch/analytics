[47:39] traveling on a rural highway near sivir
[47:41] city new mexico
[47:43] the town where our founding pastor first
[47:45] established his church
[47:47] it was approximately 5 45 a.m and still
[47:50] dark when we came upon two horses
[47:51] crossing the highway
[47:53] doing approximately 65 miles an hour
[47:56] with no warning
[47:57] and no time to stop we slammed into both
[47:59] horses killing them
[48:01] we totaled our truck but by the grace of
[48:03] god we walked away with just minor aches
[48:05] and bruises
[48:06] we covet your prayers for god's will to
[48:08] be done in our lives and by god's grace
[48:11] we will be able to help our pastor on
[48:12] the great work he's doing in africa

[51:19] thankful to god this morning for that
[51:23] [Applause]

[51:41] everything that god was doing
[51:43] all the time wow we'd be raptured out i
[51:45] think we'd be raptured out of here
[51:48] amen good to see each and every one of
[51:50] you sister shania god bless you
[51:51] sir nice to have you here with us
[51:55] amen
[51:58] well we have sung
[52:01] we have heard the testimonies
[52:29] it says and from jesus christ who is
[52:32] the faithful witness and the first
[52:35] begotten of the dead
[52:37] and the prince of the kings of the earth
[52:39] unto him that loved us
[52:41] and washed us from our sins in his own
[52:44] blood
[52:55] and have made us kings and priests
[53:00] brother says in a message it doesn't say
[53:03] and has made me
[53:05] a king and a priest and a
[53:08] he said it he made us
[53:12] that's including you and i including he
[53:14] made us
[53:15] kings and priests unto god
[53:18] and his father to him be glory and
[53:20] dominion for ever and
[53:22] ever amen yes
[53:26] may god add his blessings to the reign
[53:27] of his word you may be seated
[53:30] oh i pray that the holy spirit would
[53:32] come at this moment and just
[53:34] just take over and just give us the
[53:36] words of life that we have need of today
[53:41] how many are ready to receive something
[53:43] from the lord
[53:44] what a tremendous scripture we find here
[53:48] once again it doesn't say that he will
[53:51] make us
[53:51] in the future i want you to really note
[53:55] that
[53:56] once again it does not say that he will
[53:58] make us
[54:00] priests and kings
[54:04] already made us kings and priests
[54:08] notice once again he hath made us
[54:12] i did not do anything to deserve to be a
[54:15] king or a priest
[54:20] by his grace and his mercy on our lives
[54:22] that opposed
[54:42] i want to know if you can give god a
[54:43] clap offering this morning for doing
[54:45] that
[54:47] made us kings and priests
[55:18] yes
[55:34] and what she is
[55:37] it does not say here who he is
[55:41] it's not if the church or the bride
[55:42] recognizes who she is
[55:46] when she
[56:14] get a true
[56:39] once again it is what she is
[56:56] without
[57:10] if you
[57:22] majority of people today would answer i
[57:24] would rather be a king
[57:29] because man always wants to be in charge
[57:35] they always want somebody to be their
[57:37] subjects
[59:02] watch this now character is a victory
[59:04] not a gift
[59:05] card and a man without character
[59:10] cannot reign because power apart from
[59:13] character
[59:14] points foreign
[59:24] [Applause]
[59:27] and since he wants us to share even his
[59:30] throne
[59:45] him and the little temporary sufferings
[59:51] that we go through now it is not
[59:54] worthy to be compared to
[59:58] the tremendous
[1:00:11] those who are willing to enter into his
[1:00:13] kingdom
[1:00:16] through much tribulation
[1:00:23] kings and priests as i look at this
[1:00:26] scripture
[1:00:28] i find that a king and a priest are
[1:00:32] two very different people
[1:00:36] very two very different offices
[1:00:39] diferentes
[1:00:41] they dress different different they act
[1:00:44] different
[1:00:45] different they talk different different
[1:00:48] they have two totally different purposes
[1:01:21] god has made us
[1:01:50] two totally different men different
[1:01:52] totally different offices
[1:01:54] diferentes yet in the scriptures
[1:01:58] i find kings that try to perform the
[1:02:01] duties of a priest
[1:02:14] because it was it was such as i said two
[1:02:16] different
[1:02:17] offices and they were not to
[1:02:20] cross over to what the other one was
[1:02:25] very important to understand today
[1:02:28] in first samuel 13 you don't have to
[1:02:30] turn to it
[1:02:33] but we find that samuel had given saul a
[1:02:35] time and appointed time when he was
[1:02:37] going to come
[1:02:42] and after samuel did not arrive there in
[1:02:45] gilgal
[1:02:45] he condoned
[1:03:00] first thing samuel tells saul follows
[1:03:03] the king
[1:03:06] samuel daniel looks at him and says
[1:03:09] what hast thou done is
[1:03:14] what did you do casey is this you're a
[1:03:16] king it is a ray
[1:03:18] what are you doing offering doing
[1:03:21] something that doesn't pertain to you
[1:03:24] and samuel said to saul
[1:03:27] you have done foolishly
[1:03:31] thou has not kept the commandment of the
[1:03:33] lord thy god
[1:03:38] that he had commanded because if you
[1:03:41] would have
[1:03:49] the lord would have established thy
[1:03:51] kingdom upon israel
[1:03:56] forever
[1:04:05] you would have been a there would have
[1:04:06] been a descendant of kings come forth
[1:04:08] from you
[1:04:09] know you would have
[1:04:24] king we find out in second chronicles 26
[1:04:28] and second chronicles by the name of
[1:04:31] uzziah
[1:04:33] we all know these and i i don't want to
[1:04:35] i don't want to spend a lot of time in
[1:04:36] this
[1:04:36] no kiddo but it says when usaiah was
[1:04:40] strong
[1:04:42] it seems like that's when a lot of men
[1:04:44] get into trouble
[1:04:47] it seems that that's when a lot of
[1:04:48] people get into trouble
[1:05:20] when he was strong
[1:05:23] his heart was lifted up to his
[1:05:25] destruction
[1:05:28] he transgressed against god
[1:05:31] and went into the temple of the lord
[1:05:34] and he burned
[1:05:46] he was the priest at that time
[1:05:55] and they told him that burning instance
[1:05:58] unto the lord
[1:06:00] sacrifice
[1:06:37] here is some priest telling him you've
[1:06:39] just trespassed in your own kingdom
[1:07:10] because a king tried to be a priest
[1:07:16] why was it so wrong because
[1:07:19] god had set aside the seed of aaron
[1:07:24] to be the priest
[1:07:37] unto the children of israel
[1:07:40] that no stranger which is not of the
[1:07:44] seed of aaron
[1:07:47] come near to offer incense unto the lord
[1:07:51] you were not of the seed of aaron you
[1:07:53] were not to offer incense
[1:08:09] yes and thou shalt appoint aaron and his
[1:08:11] sons
[1:08:12] and they shall wait on the priest's
[1:08:14] office
[1:08:21] office and the stranger that cometh nigh
[1:08:24] shall be putin
[1:08:28] do you see that when we enter into uh an
[1:08:31] office that don't pertain to us
[1:08:33] strangers we are
[1:09:02] that the stranger cometh not
[1:09:18] a territory that angels fear to trot
[1:09:22] and i believe that that's why matthew
[1:09:24] seven tells us
[1:09:28] in that day lord lord have we not
[1:09:31] prophesied and you're not prophetic
[1:09:58] we better know what we're doing
[1:10:03] we better know what god has called us
[1:10:05] for
[1:10:07] now you might say well brother he says i
[1:10:09] find in first kings
[1:10:12] that solomon said the bible says that
[1:10:14] solomon burned some offerings the burnt
[1:10:17] offering and peace offerings
[1:10:21] he burned incense upon the altar
[1:10:24] as a king let me tell you you've got to
[1:10:27] read the whole story of
[1:10:29] solomon to know even though it has that
[1:10:32] solomon burned incense
[1:10:36] he did not do it on his own instructed
[1:10:39] the priest to do it
[1:10:47] now watch this now the requirements of a
[1:10:50] king
[1:10:51] let's go to deuteronomy 17.
[1:10:55] these are the requirements of a king
[1:11:01] and i'm going to read it just in english
[1:11:02] to save some time here
[1:11:04] when thou art come unto the land which
[1:11:06] the lord thy god giveth thee
[1:11:08] and shall possess it and shall shall
[1:11:10] dwell therein
[1:11:12] and shall say i will set a king over me
[1:11:15] like as all the nations that are about
[1:11:18] me
[1:11:19] thou shalt in any wise set him
[1:11:22] king over thee whom the lord thy god
[1:11:25] shall
[1:11:26] choose not your choosing whom the lord
[1:11:28] our god shall choose
[1:11:30] one from among your brethren
[1:11:34] in other words this could not be
[1:11:36] somebody that came from the outside in
[1:11:38] estonia
[1:11:41] one from among thy brethren shalt thou
[1:11:43] set king over thee
[1:11:45] thou mayest not set a stranger over thee
[1:11:48] oh there's a stranger again which is not
[1:11:52] thy brother
[1:11:54] and it shall be when he sitteth upon the
[1:11:56] throne of his kingdom
[1:11:58] that he shall write him a copy of this
[1:12:02] law in a book out of that which is
[1:12:04] before the priests
[1:12:06] the levites and it shall be with him and
[1:12:09] he shall read therein
[1:12:11] all the days of his life that's what a
[1:12:12] king is supposed to do
[1:12:15] that he may learn to fear the lord his
[1:12:17] god to keep
[1:12:18] all the words of this law and these
[1:12:21] statutes to do them
[1:12:23] that his heart be not lifted up
[1:12:26] above his brethren wow
[1:12:30] that there's a lot there there's a lot
[1:12:31] here why because
[1:12:33] there are spirits that that come up
[1:12:35] right
[1:12:36] and that's when people began to feel
[1:12:38] like they are better or superior
[1:12:41] than their brothers but if you keep the
[1:12:44] law
[1:12:46] you read it every day what will it do
[1:12:48] it'll
[1:12:49] keep you from from your heart being
[1:12:51] lifted up
[1:12:52] above your brother i'm going to read the
[1:12:56] word every day
[1:12:58] you can listen to it every day if you
[1:13:00] did if you asked
[1:13:01] then you would never think that you're
[1:13:02] better than your brother
[1:13:06] and then he turn aside from the
[1:13:08] commandment to the right hand or to the
[1:13:09] left to the end that he may prolong his
[1:13:12] days
[1:13:12] in his kingdom he and his children in
[1:13:15] the midst of israel my goodness now
[1:13:19] we see that a king and a priest
[1:13:24] each had things to maintain in their
[1:13:26] offices that they were called
[1:13:30] and as i
[1:13:42] i asked the question this to this this
[1:13:44] to brother aaron and sister abigail
[1:13:47] abigail and i said but even though a
[1:13:50] king couldn't be a priest
[1:13:52] would be a king but in the old testament
[1:13:55] i do
[1:13:56] find one person
[1:14:12] who
[1:14:25] king of salem and priest of the most
[1:14:29] high god
[1:14:30] oh i like that this morning i love that
[1:14:33] this morning
[1:14:34] because and through it all through the
[1:14:37] pipes and the shadows
[1:14:39] melchizedek was a pre-figure of jesus
[1:14:42] christ
[1:14:45] now notice this now he was king of salem
[1:14:49] and he was priest of the most high god
[1:14:53] who met abram returning from the
[1:14:55] slaughter of the king
[1:14:59] and he blessed him once again
[1:15:01] melchizedek was a pre-figure of the lord
[1:15:04] jesus christ
[1:15:06] what was it that the kinsmen redeemer
[1:15:10] that was coming
[1:15:21] after the order
[1:15:32] so also christ glorified not himself
[1:15:40] but he that said unto him thou art my
[1:15:43] son today have i begotten thee
[1:15:48] and he saith also in another place
[1:16:00] we know that there is much dispute about
[1:16:02] this person melchizedek is
[1:16:16] it was not just a priesthood
[1:16:32] he
[1:16:46] and he ate
[1:17:14] what was that order he could be both
[1:17:16] king and priest
[1:17:21] i'm going to let that one set just for a
[1:17:22] moment
[1:17:24] i'm going to say it again this is the
[1:17:26] order of melchizedek
[1:17:38] i'll let that one set just for a little
[1:17:39] while
[1:17:42] what an order okay or then to not just
[1:17:45] be a
[1:17:46] king
[1:17:52] my goodness dios mio
[1:17:56] after the order of melchizedek that
[1:17:58] phrase
[1:18:02] is spoken seven times in the bible
[1:18:06] once in the old testament six times in
[1:18:09] the new testament
[1:18:15] a priest under the old testament order
[1:18:20] never sat down how many know that
[1:18:24] they never sat down a priest in the old
[1:18:27] testament
[1:18:29] always standing up
[1:18:32] doing work in the throat during the
[1:18:35] sacrifices
[1:18:36] they were always moving in order
[1:18:51] christ being after the order of
[1:19:12] could not listen closely
[1:19:16] could not be made perfect nope under the
[1:19:19] blood of bulls and ghosts
[1:19:34] same thing you did
[1:19:43] [Music]
[1:20:03] because that's what i'm here for to help
[1:20:04] you
[1:20:06] but i can tell you exactly what the
[1:20:08] problem is
[1:20:10] year after year after year the same
[1:20:11] thing
[1:20:16] those priests never sat down
[1:20:20] was never finished but the worshiper now
[1:20:26] under a new covenant the worshiper wants
[1:20:29] purge
[1:20:44] sitting at the right hand of the father
[1:20:48] what is it are you orders
[1:20:53] i hope you get that this morning it's a
[1:20:56] new order a new day
[1:20:58] estonia
[1:21:00] that's the kind of god we serve today
[1:21:04] we have a high priest
[1:21:08] oh i want you to tell your neighbors
[1:21:12] we
[1:21:32] oh how god is so good watch this now
[1:21:35] hebrews 10.
[1:21:36] evidence yes and every priest verse 11
[1:21:38] every priest standeth
[1:21:40] daily ministering what is he doing
[1:21:43] ending daily
[1:21:47] ministering and offering often times
[1:21:50] the same sacrifices which can never take
[1:21:54] away sins
[1:22:06] after he had offered one sacrifice for
[1:22:09] sins
[1:22:10] forever yes get down on the right hand
[1:22:13] of god
[1:22:15] and under this new order
[1:22:20] making intercessions
[1:22:33] here i can't run with it i'm trying to
[1:22:35] run but oh god
[1:23:28] lots of different places churches
[1:23:30] everything else
[1:23:32] but there is only one group of people
[1:23:36] that can accomplish being both a king
[1:23:39] and a priest
[1:23:41] their names are written on the lamb's
[1:23:44] book of life
[1:24:00] i don't know about you but just say
[1:24:02] neighbor
[1:24:03] we are kings and priests watch this now
[1:24:07] till he hath made us kings and priests
[1:24:11] timothy 2 12 if we suffer
[1:24:34] i see people oh my gosh they're closing
[1:24:37] us down again
[1:24:38] oh my gosh i don't know how many audios
[1:24:41] have you been relying on your own skills
[1:24:43] that's been
[1:24:44] relying on god this whole time
[1:24:47] how am i going to make it you're a king
[1:24:52] you're a priest what is this a joke
[1:25:32] the priests didn't worry about where
[1:25:33] they were going to get their money from
[1:25:34] el reynolds
[1:25:36] i didn't worry about where they were
[1:25:37] going to get their next meal
[1:25:41] god had provided a way to camino priest
[1:25:51] if we suffer
[1:26:21] everyone wants to reign without
[1:26:23] suffering
[1:26:26] in their minds they want to be on a
[1:26:27] throne
[1:26:30] under high horse reigning and ruling
[1:26:34] hernandez but you have to learn to rule
[1:26:37] your own
[1:26:38] atmosphere first
[1:26:42] you gotta learn how to rule your own
[1:26:43] house
[1:26:48] hello everybody hello
[1:26:52] you got to rule your own spirit
[1:26:56] the bible says you gotta be able to rule
[1:26:59] or take care of your own vessel
[1:27:02] this and it starts by you presenting
[1:27:05] your body a living sacrifice
[1:27:12] of a priest you cannot reign as a king
[1:27:45] watch now let's find out what kind of
[1:27:47] sacrifices we are to offer
[1:27:50] real quick i'm going to read it just in
[1:27:51] english hebrews 13 15.
[1:27:55] by him therefore let us offer the
[1:27:58] sacrifice of praise to god
[1:28:00] continually that is the fruit of our
[1:28:03] lips giving thanks to his name
[1:28:06] second first peter 2 5 he also as
[1:28:09] lively stones are built up a spiritual
[1:28:12] house
[1:28:14] and holy priesthood to offer up
[1:28:17] spiritual sacrifices
[1:28:18] acceptable to god by jesus christ
[1:28:22] romans 12 1 i beseech you therefore
[1:28:25] brethren
[1:28:26] by the mercies of god that ye present
[1:28:28] your bodies
[1:28:29] a living sacrifice holy acceptable unto
[1:28:33] god
[1:28:34] which is your reasonable service once
[1:28:36] again
[1:28:37] a king rules and a priest
[1:28:54] yes
[1:29:09] something that's very fascinating to me
[1:29:10] that i found very fascinating
[1:29:14] because we always think of the
[1:29:15] priesthood
[1:29:18] we see that god has placed man
[1:29:48] oh we understand there's offices his
[1:29:50] place don't get me wrong watch how i'm
[1:29:52] how i'm putting this
[1:29:53] official but every person in the kingdom
[1:29:58] was to be a priest what he wanted
[1:30:02] but watch watch what happened here
[1:30:05] take my word for i'm going to give you
[1:30:06] scripture exodus 19.
[1:30:10] 5 and 6. now therefore if ye will obey
[1:30:13] my voice indeed and keep my covenant
[1:30:15] then you shall be a peculiar treasure
[1:30:19] who what do you mean that you don't have
[1:30:21] no money you're a peculiar treasure
[1:30:23] within yourself
[1:30:26] you're a peculiar treasure unto me
[1:30:29] above all people
[1:30:45] i'm going to say it again and you shall
[1:30:47] be unto me
[1:30:50] a kingdom of priests not a temple of
[1:30:54] priests
[1:30:56] kingdom of priest here he's joining
[1:31:00] together the kingship
[1:31:03] with the priesthood you shall be a
[1:31:08] kingdom of priest
[1:31:12] and a holy nation these are the words
[1:31:15] which
[1:31:16] thou shalt speak unto the children of
[1:31:17] israel
[1:31:20] to all the children of israel this was
[1:31:24] god's plan
[1:31:25] for israel to be a kingdom of priests
[1:31:39] but ye are a chosen generation
[1:32:10] let's
[1:32:21] shall be a kingly priesthood
[1:32:53] that's why revelation 19 16 says
[1:32:56] he hath on his name and on his thy
[1:32:59] name written king of kings
[1:33:02] and lord of lords
[1:33:20] how many kings and priests do we have
[1:33:21] here
[1:33:24] king of kings and lord of lords
[1:33:28] but we must reign in life
[1:33:31] right now
[1:33:35] this is the problem to me that that when
[1:33:37] i when i talk to people it's
[1:33:38] the problem in their mind everything is
[1:33:41] we're gonna be
[1:33:42] kings and priests

[2:01:42] you're a priest
[2:01:47] conduct yourself as one conduct
[2:02:02] we
[2:02:08] a priest doesn't take their feelings
[2:02:09] into consideration
[2:02:14] he's a priest
[2:02:17] he gets the feelings he is touched by
[2:02:20] the feelings of

[2:02:55] everything that's going on
[2:02:58] or
[2:03:11] we are after the order
[2:03:52] the problem is what's coming from your
[2:03:55] heart
[2:03:56] to your lips
[2:04:00] that was a doctor in a time of
[2:04:03] a war dealing with dysentery
[2:04:08] patience
[2:04:24] really didn't whatever they said
[2:04:27] but the next question show me your
[2:04:29] tongue because the tongue
[2:04:32] showed the doctor condition of the
[2:04:34] patient
[2:04:35] i'm here to tell you it's not that our
[2:04:37] tongue and what comes from it
[2:04:40] of your heart you're a high priest or
[2:04:44] not
[2:04:45] you want to be like everyone else they
[2:04:47] said this so i said this
[2:04:48] this year watch it
[2:05:48] [Music]
[2:06:00] is
[2:06:06] [Music]
[2:06:11] when it's used wrong it's a breach and
[2:06:14] that's
[2:06:28] solomon talks about it
[2:06:35] by lips oh my spouse
[2:06:38] oh miss poster you
[2:06:42] stay kings
[2:06:46] and what is coming forth from your lips
[2:06:48] giving praises
[2:06:49] to his name by lips oh my spouse
[2:06:55] they drop as the honeycomb
[2:07:09] isn't the holy ghost the promised land
[2:07:13] and isn't that land of land flowing with
[2:07:15] milk and honey yes
[2:07:16] where is it flowing from down the floor
[2:07:19] from her lips
[2:07:24] the beauty of the promised land is seen
[2:07:26] in the bride
[2:07:27] especially in her tongue and lips
[2:07:33] she doesn't retaliate she doesn't speak
[2:07:36] evil of no one
[2:07:38] she's a priest
[2:07:44] what else could i do to bring this
[2:07:46] message to you
[2:07:51] some people just sit there and say wow
[2:08:06] still with me oh kings and priests
[2:08:13] that's what she is
[2:08:16] the beauty is in her tongue and lips
[2:08:20] i think it was abraham lincoln that said
[2:08:22] this
[2:08:24] if i were to write a book about all the
[2:08:27] bad things that people said about me
[2:08:31] and i would listen to all those bad
[2:08:33] things
[2:08:35] i would never perform in the highest
[2:08:38] office of the united states of america
[2:08:43] if we listen to every bad thing that
[2:08:45] everybody has to say
[2:09:02] because when
[2:09:15] he has a book of memories
[2:09:59] and it shall make thy belly bitter
[2:10:02] but it shall be in thy mouth sweet as
[2:10:05] honey
[2:10:07] where does that sweet honey come from
[2:10:09] from the holy ghost
[2:10:11] and the holy ghost
[2:10:15] give me the little book and i took the
[2:10:18] book
[2:10:19] and i ate it it was in my mouth sweetest
[2:10:22] honey
[2:10:24] but in my stomach it was bitter
