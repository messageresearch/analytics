========================================

now now we get to the isle of patmos now to get started the night first first place we want to say it's the title of this is the patmos vision it took place in 80 between 1895 and 96. the place was at the isle of patmos its location is 30 miles off of the coast of asia minor west object of the ephesian church in the a agency board by the mediterranean that's the position where it's at question the reason why john was there a godly man a righteous man a man of good reputation good character never in trouble why was this man there the bible said for the word of god in the testimony of jesus christ now we got the city the isle of patmos in the agency 30 miles off the coast approximately 30 miles around it rocky full of blizzards and scorpions and so forth and used for a prison house like alcatraz this they get a prisoner they can't keep in prison nearly so such a horrible criminal they put him out on alcatraz and now the toughest sainted john the divine the life of the disciples and the only one who died a natural death john before going to the island was accused of being a witch [Music] i was born in a bat of greece for 24 hours without scorching it [Music] [Music] the romans give that he was a witch and bewitched the greeks what the carnal mind can think of oh what a setting now [Music] all right the church then honored john or under great persecution john writes the ninth verse by john who also am your brother and triple a and companion in tribulation and in the kingdom and in the patience of jesus christ was in the isle that is called patmos for the word of god and for the testimony of jesus christ in other words he took the word of god and was proving it that was the word of god and christ came back through him and testified that he was right amen john was a prophet we know that and so they were asking these questions so god just had the roman empire to pick him up and set him out there on he said now come on john i want to show you something that's going to happen the last of the apostles do you want no more to write it but john saw the setting out on the isle of patmos from 1895 until 1896 and he wrote it and he said i am your brother and companion in tribulation he got in the spirit before anything took place the first thing he did he was in the aisle called patmos all these things that he did and he said i heard a voice and all these other things but before anything took place he was in the spirit and if you notice that your bible big capital spirit holy spirit amen he got in the spirit oh i just think that's wonderful i was in the spirit on the lord's day be careful john you've entered into the spirit something's going to be revealed to you what is it a trumpet sound the first thing [Music] repent now before the time's too late i'm alpha and omega that's the first thing that he let him know who he was who's this approaching is just king jesus king god king holy ghost he said i'm all of it i'm from a to z i'm the beginning and the ending i'm the immortal eternal one now and i turned to see the voice that spake under me and being turned i saw seven golden candle sticks my did you notice stars candlesticks lamps what does it mean what does this mean that the dispensation that we're living in is nighttime channels and lights and stars mean night and what does a star do it reflects the light of the sun until the sun returns amen blessed be the name of the lord now that's watching us a little further as we take the rest of this uh 13th verse and in the midst that's the middle of the golden candlesticks one like the son of man pull with the garment down to the foot and gird it about the paps with a golden girdle and john showed that he wasn't in the day of his prophecy as a prophet neither was he come out into the days of his kingship but he was in the day of the lord as a judge now how many knows that the priest having his girdle is strained around his waistline meant he was in service anyone who reads the testaments and knows the old testament knows that now watch these seven things here he misses his head his hair his eyes his feet his voice seven things he mentioned you're the sevenfold glory of jesus christ let me read it his head and his hair was white as wool as white as snow his eyes were flames of art now now i noticed the first thing that we noticed his head and his hair was white like wool his head and his hair was quite light warm now it does not mean that he was aged did this that wasn't the reason of it he wasn't aged to do this he was it was because of his experience and qualification and his wisdom because he's eternal and eternal cannot age you understand head hair eyes were like flames of fire think of it those eyes who once was dim with human tears now to come flames of fire now let's see we'll soon down the end of the page now hair like wall and his eyes were flames of fire and his feet uh a feet like a brass burned in a furnace and his voice the sound of many water voice of many waters what does waters represent if you want to mark it down turn to revelation 17 15 and you'll find the bible says the water switched our source is sickness and multitudes and people in tongues it's a judgment the bias of the ministers through the holy spirit that's crying out to the people never age standing there wash the many waters cry out sickness demolition the voice of those seven stars in his hands i ever church age preaching the baptism the holy ghost the baptism in jesus name speaking in tongues the power of god the resurrection of christ the second coming divine judgment the voice of many waters for this one it looked like the son of man mary water wash out hair like wool and eyes like plain safar feet like brave and a voice of many waters and he had in his right hand seven stars now the seven stars that was in my right hand he had seven stars in his right hand which means the seven ministers of seven ages it's beautiful he held them in his right hand think right hand doesn't exactly mean like christ sitting on god's right hand it doesn't mean that god's got a right hand because god is the spirit but christ was the right hand of power and remember the seven stars was in his right hand just think they were drawing their curse their light from him they were completely under his control in his right hand every true servant of god is the same way now the seventh and last um a representation of this person and out of his mouth goes a sharp two-eighth sword i mean that's the sixth one out of his mouth goes a sharp two-eighth sword a sharp two eight short what was going from the mouth of this person the word of god it's a sharp created sword what was it doing discerning the thoughts of the heart the intent goes even deeper than the meat the flesh the blood cells into the bone down into the of the thoughts and intents of the heart that's what the word of god does all right now one more quotation we touch the 20th so now let's see here on this first chair now the 16 and he had in his right hand seven stars now let's take the and uh the his countenances out of his mouth goes the sharp trade sword and his countenances were like the sun shining in its strength the prophet couldn't stand the lord he's such a vision he just he just sapped his strength and he fell right down now watch and he laid his right hand above me saying unto me fear not i am the first and the last oh but not a prophet god i am the first and the light i'm the first of the revelation the last of the revelations i'm he that was and he that is and he that will come that's the i am a lady's right hand upon me saying unto me fear not i am the first in the last i am he that liveth and was dead and behold i am a lifeboard ever more right now and then he screamed out amen and have the keys of hell and death now he gives a command and then we start to end the chapter the 19th verse write the veins which i have seen and the things which are and the things which shall be here after we talk the twist verse the mystery of the seven stars without source in the right hand are seven golden candlesticks the seven stars are seven angels of the seven churches and the seven candlesticks which all stars are the seven churches oh it's breathtaking friend seems standard in the supreme supremacy of his deity he's the judge the priest the king the eagle the lamb the lion the alpha the omega the father's son holy ghost he that it was which is and shall come try it out the winepress and the fierceness of god is everything there john looked up and saw him standing here with feet of breath i was like flames of fire run into his world throughout the earth daniel saw him 700 years before that the same position the same kind same man standing on the ancient of days and more like the son of man that joined in with him and all his judgment was committed to him stand the white throne judgment seeing these things what kind of people are we to be friends god bless you with my prayer
