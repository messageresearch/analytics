Jesus Christ the same yesterday and today and forever you may be seated I'd like to share something with you that's been on my heart and it's very personal to me who loves the story of Samson well you know how you know how the Philistines captured Samson and shaved all his hair off and he lost all his strength same thing with my papa except they didn't shave all his hair off he fell the doctor said he'll never be able to walk again and he's been telling me do you scratch his nose for him but now he could lift up his arm and scratches no man knows his himself and he could also sit up on his chair and he could walk a little bit with help and I know that that was God [Applause] and the same with Samson while he was in prison he his hair started going back and he got all his strength back and I know that this God of Samson is the same god of today god bless you Wow you believe that that the same God of Samson is the same God here tonight now I got something to tell you I don't know about you young people you young kids here but I was outside earlier and I walked inside and I saw this man it looks kind of kind of funny at first I didn't know who he was and then I said hey brother who are you and he goes I come from the land of the Philistines and I come here to encourage my young ladies and I come here to encourage the young men tonight I said really well who are you and I maybe maybe longer brothers can go help him I think he was over there trying to tie up a a lion or something like that yeah there was a lion outside a church can you believe that you you don't believe me you're looking at me like there's no way bro no there was a lion outside of church and this guy was out there and he ripped his lion apart with his bare hands because he said nothing's gonna happen to my little children that are here tonight so I'm gonna ask Samson to come up and tell you a little bit himself so maybe maybe it'll help you tonight that your protector is here tonight and his name is well here I'm gonna tell you guys a little story today I'm gonna tell you a little story today you guys want to hear story you want to hear how great God is well my name is Samson I'm gonna set this job that's a killing machine I'm one set that there but anything happens I'm ready to get down god bless each and every one of you all you children you guys happy today well from the land of the Philistines there was a man who came his name was Samson he was a judge he's one of the judges he judged for 20 years over the Israelites and he was he was a mighty man of God I rest up as Samson but I'm gonna tell you the story of Samson okay I'm gonna tell you the story because it's a it's a it Samson was a man who he showed and he proved all that God was all the power that God said he had Samson when he was here on earth when he was walking he proved that God was everything he said he was so I'm gonna tell you a little story today see Samson in that you remember you remember the children of Israel in the time time of Moses right and during those times they had the Israelites were we're in the desert for 40 years you guys remember that your Sunday School teachers they teach you that right well in those times it was the same thing when when Samson came okay when Samson came the children were delivered into the hands of the Philistines okay for 40 years and that was during the time the Samson came on the scene okay and the beginning of the story it talks about the angel of the Lord visiting Samson's mom so when when the angel the Lord came to Samson's mom he said he said you're going to have a son sound familiar you guys know the story he says you're going to have a son and and he's going to and he's going he's going to be the deliverer of Israel he's going to deliver Israel but he's going to be a Nazarite from Earth okay so you find we see that that he had to come through the vow of the Nazarite you guys know what the valve and Nazarite was the the valve the Nazarite well you he was you couldn't drink no wine or no strong drink of course you guys don't do that right and they they were not supposed to cut their hair what I mean they were not to cut their hair they were not to eat no unclean food but as important as all those three words the vow of a Nazirite it was a special calling it was something special that you would devote your life to get closer to God and we can we can do the we can take the Nazareth the velvet as right right who wants to get closer to God tonight who's who's come here to get closer to God man we want to get closer to God right that was the vow of a Nazarite to get closer to God so we see that that they didn't want to take no pleasure that this was the bow that the angel gave to Samson's mom it wasn't just for Samson the mom she had to take the vow to okay until Samson would come til that blessing would come she had to take the same bow so she had she took the bow of the nazaré as well you know and as she did you know that's the whole thing is that you have to put everything in this world to the side all things that that that this world any desires you have this one they put it to the side like you know how you guys like to play the Xbox no that's the wrong crowd right no Xbox lovers okay there's an honest he's up he's being honest well see all of those things he would put when Samson came he put all of those things to the side and his whole goal was to get closer to God that was his main goal in his life he would he would submit himself to God in every way that's what he did so as Samson began to get older like a young man he uh he started to look upon girls and on now you guys right so as he began to find he liked young lady he told his father go down to that land and bring me about a bride he had a particular woman that he liked so his father says well you can't marry our own people of our own people you can't take a bride of our own he says no I want that one so he had one in particular she's a Philistine so here goes his his dad down to Tim now you know and when he goes down to Timna he sees a woman in Timnath the daughters of the Philistines and on his way there though had some trouble outside on his way there he goes through the vineyard of Timna okay and as he's going through there he slayed a lion goes and tries to attack him man believe that this life just comes out of nowhere tries to bite him for no reason so what does he do he part you believe that there's bare hands he rips him to pieces so the goal and they get the girl they come back and as he's coming back he remembers oh shoot I killed the lion over there go check it out we hunters we do that right no we don't do that right so all right so he goes inside of that inside of that lion there was low and behold bees made this hive inside of there and brother branham our prophet he says that was the sweetest honey Samson ever eaten in his whole life was that honey sense he was I could just see him right now just eating it so that sounds pretty good right now some honey hmm so he takes that honey and goes I'm gonna give some to take some to my mom and dad so he goes in there there there so then you know he has his bride there and they say well let's throw a bash let's throw a big old party how many of you guys like parties he liked the party Tommy loves loves to party this guy is a party animal yes he is I'm coming to find that out see cuz look so they throw this big ol party they invite you know thirty companions the Bible tells us and these companions they were of the land of the Philistines - Sol Sampson got kind of close to him and he was really good friends with one of them and as he gets there he says I have an idea I'm gonna give him a riddle and let me see if they can't figure out this riddle so he starts to tell the riddle and nobody could figure it out here we're on day six they had seven days to figure out the riddle so like Philistines are cowards they go and they tell the wife you you need to tell us what the riddle is if not we're gonna kill you we're gonna kill you we're gonna kill your father and we're gonna put you both in the house and burn it so you better tell us or you're gonna die so she goes and you know Samson please sweetheart would you tell me what the riddle is and here's Samson he trusts her believed that she loved him and cows that tells the riddle so they go and they tell Samson the riddle Samson knew there's no way he they could have figured the real out there's no way sorry guys and so anyways they figured out the riddle he is so upset with her that he just takes off he was so mad his father knew how mad he was he got so mad that he went he went to Ashkelon and he slayed thirty men he slayed thirty Philistines you know and it was at that time Samson began to hate the Philistines he began to to want to murder every one of them kill them all and so he goes to Ashkelon he slew 30 min there and so then after you know calms down you know you that get mad you you're all mad right and then you come down here look okay huh back to my senses back to reality right so then he's back to reality again right so he goes back and his dad thought he hated his wife so much he gave him to his best friend gave his wife to his best friend so there goes Samson he's furious again he takes off so then he starts to think about here he is on that you know right he's all ticked off and when he gets back he says I'm gonna I'm gonna take a sacrifice for my wife I'm gonna get her back so reconciles everything with his woman and everything is good but he's still so mad at the Philistines if I could just do something to get back at them and I could just do a really good number on him so then what does he do now I don't know about you but I have a dog outside and if she makes me mad I can't catch her there's no way I get mad I start throwing stuff at her but you imagine that right Samson goes on catches 300 foxes how in the world I can't even catch a dog this is this is and you got to remember to every time Samson would do this if the Bible says the Spirit of the Lord will come upon him so we know we know that it wasn't just an average man that was doing it it was a man that was anointed by the Spirit of God and he was born for a purpose right you guys believe you're born for a purpose you were born for a purpose to make me smile yes you were so Samson he was born for a purpose his purpose was to defeat the Philistines to deliver the children of Israel out of the hands of the Philistine so here he goes he catches three hundred foxes how I don't know but he catches them but he didn't just catch him now I'm not talking to you this story so you guys could go do bad things like like things on fire but what he did let me tell you what he did I had a brother your dad he loved fire but anyways that's another story he lit the tails of these foxes on fire and what did he do he sent them through the fields of corn burned all their corn all their vineyards he burnt all of their olive trees God the Philistines were they were fit to be tied this time that was it so they were so mad they're like who in the world did this and here here's a guy he's a little tattletale I don't know what I think it was that guy over there that that you know married that you know Philistine girl he's all crazy killing people go ask him so they go looking for Samson like where's this guy so they go to that to to the men of Judah and they're like where's where's the idiot that let all these fields on fur get him over here now and they're like we don't know what you're talking about why are you coming against us and said well we know it was Samson so go find him bring him over here or we're gonna kill everybody here so here goes here goes the manager I mean you gotta understand okay you remember the movie Lion King right you ever see Lion King okay do you remember whenever the hyenas would say you remember that right Mufasa did get all scared right well that's how they were about Sampson man they say Samson Samson so here's the men of Judah you did Judah they thought I'd go get him so they go and they say I'm not going by myself get about three thousand minutes tie that guy up he's crazy I know the purpose that because see these were these were children of Israel now they knew the purpose that that Samson was born for because he when Samson was born in the house of Dan that's that he grew up with the Danah Knights which that's one of the tribes of Israel so when he they went to they went to that when he was born as a little boy the Bible says the Spirit of the Lord will move upon him you imagine come hear me if like this little boy would just pick up a big ol something that was ten times his size and carry it somewhere those were the things those were the things that were going on when Samson was a little boy so they knew the purpose that he was born for so I said oh no we're gonna we need some of the best people who know this guy we need about 3,000 men go up there and I know he's up on that hill up there when I have time to come down here I don't know why we're gonna do it they were scared took three 3,000 men to go get him so they go and get him and there he is and he says what are you guys here for says you you gotta go pay to pay your do man these these Philistines are gonna they're gonna wipe us out get down there and face face what you've done so he says I'll do it he says but you've got to promise me that you guys aren't gonna try to kill me yourself and as long as you promise you're not going to kill me I'll go so here he goes they go only tie them up imagine they have Samson tied up prophet who God tells us Samson wasn't this big oh dude like wow I'm not that big like like Big Mac yeah that you imagine like not not like that I won't use another example because somebody might get hurt you know but he was a scrawny fellow Samson wasn't a big guy we know that from the Prophet he wasn't this big old like up image that they placed that he had to all these muscles and real big no no no sir he was a skinny little guy anointed by the power of Almighty God that's what Samson was so they go and they deliver him they're happy whoo-hoo we just got away with one right now we're gonna live they deliver him to the Philistines then the Philistines make a major error they start to get all huffy with him think they're gonna take him down there was a thousand of these men okay and Samson and we all know the story that part right Samson with the jawbone of a donkey now I know you're looking at this and you're saying that brother that way too big but over here you might have little donkeys okay where I come from this is normal size of a donkey okay so he comes with he sees a new job bone of a donkey picks it up and he slays a thousand Philistines just wiped them out clean and so here's Samson this is the part of the story many people don't hear that it's the most tremendous and amazing thing that I've ever heard so after he slays them here he is tired just wasted and he says Lord you wouldn't have delivered a thousand of them Philistines into my hand for me to just die a thirst here you guys heard this so he's dying of thirst and just like the rock that that was with the children of Israel in the desert all of the sudden God caused a hollow place in that jaw bone and it began to flow with water and as Samson is there and one starts to drink oh oh and the Bible says he was he was besides himself he he was almost losing it like going crazy and he starts to drink he starts get his wits back oh thanks oh and that is the power of our God that we serve so if you're ever wondering how powerful God is he was not only going to take us through the storm but he's going to give us what we need after the storm that's the most amazing part to me about the story of Samson so time goes on and now the Philistines are like there's nothing we can do to beat this guy I don't know we know that it is a power of Almighty God that lives inside of him there's no explaining it there's no explanation there's no way we could figure it out so then he goes to Gaza he goes to Gaza at this point Mufasa is everywhere they're scared oh my god Samson is going to just wipe us out at any given moment we could just die so every morning the Philistines when they leave their household manual Majan how many times they'd kiss mom you know whenever you guys are leaving and you're gonna have a rough day ahead of you and you go man I better go kiss my mom oh I better go kiss my dad you know that's how these these guys were man like any given moment I'm gonna lose my life I'm gonna die so then they goes to Gaza and now they have tabs on Samson everywhere he goes we're gonna have to trap this guy so he's in Gaza and they closed the gates in on him okay close the gates in on him they said we don't want to mess with him leave him there we'll bring thousands of men and we'll just kill him in the morning and so why he does does something really amazing he wakes up at midnight why because he's a man of God and he listens to everything that God tells every warning that he gives so like the way your mom tells you hey don't do that that's bad you shouldn't be acting that way you shouldn't be doing this you shouldn't be doing that right that's a warning from your parents well that's the way God was with Samson he'd give him warnings so here's Samson you know and you read the story and it says that he took those gates upon his back at midnight in the middle of the night he goes and throws those gates on his back and the Bible says he carries a month onto a hill but it doesn't tell you that Hill was 30 miles away my wall he carries those gates for 30 miles not just the gates the pillars and every luck they had on that gate was on there and he carries that 30 miles I can't even carry one of my kids a block he carried the gates and everything for 30 miles that's them and and every time remember every time the Bible tells you the Spirit of the Lord came upon him and that's when he was not a normal man so that's what happens in Gaza now now he meets Delilah right and when he meets Delilah he falls in love with her right away like I did with Jenny same thing falls in love with her love at first sight he loved her and the Philistines stars they saw this girl you know let's go talk to the ground try to bribe her like we did his wife so they go and tell her if you could find out the secret of his heart we'll give you a thousand pieces of silver I know I don't sound like much you guys are looking at me a bunch of nickels no this was a thousand pieces of silver that she would be rich she'd be taken care of for her mom and dad everybody around her you're taking care of for the rest of her life so she takes the bribe and so they tell him well you know the story kind of running out of time here they there's three things that that she tells him to do the first thing she tells him bind him with green wits that hadn't been dried yet and when you when you when you bind him with those Samson's telling lies when you buy me with those it's like I don't have no strength I have no strength just as a normal man so there she goes who binds him Philistines are upon you Samson starts killing everybody again say like you lied to me you mocked me and told me lies as she tells him is there something okay okay I'll tell you this time for real says if you buy me with new ropes that have never been occupied I'll have a strength of any other man so here she goes a little sneaky girl ties him up with new ropes that had never been occupied Philistines are upon thee Samson apart like a thread yeah I'm right here you gotta watch it sneaky so she's all mad she's sayin you lie to me again and he goes yeah I'll tell you this time for reals if you put a web on my head and braid my locs or and put a pin in it I have the strength of any other man so Philistines are upon me something goes up does the same thing like forget it I give up on you and the Bible says that she pressed him daily she pressed him every day to tell her the truth finally he told her the secret of his heart he told her I was born through the vowel the Nazarite if a razor came upon my head and you shaved my head I'd have the strength of any other man so she knows that this time he told the truth he says she calls Philistine they bring the money and everything he says she's told me all the secrets of his heart so we know that when he got up he tried to shake himself couldn't do it so then so then they captured him the very first thing they did he plucked out his eyes right can you imagine how Samson felt at that point all his whole life he always could feel the presence of the Lord come upon him and then have to live in a time to where he couldn't have no interaction with God he could never feel the Spirit of the Lord come upon him oh what a misery what a miserable time for him right what a horrible day that would be that must have been for Samson and not only that but the very thing he was he was brought to this earth for he was now captured by the Philistines the very people he was called to destroy to deliver the children of Israel from now he was their prisoner well that must have been really really though time for Samson so here he's grinding in the prison house and when he comes out of the prison that you know the Philistines the Lords of the Philistines they're all pumped up and happy they're like our God Dagon he delivered you know our enemy Samson into our hands what a great God we serve so he said you know what we're gonna do all the Lords of the Philistines said let's throw a big party let's bring everybody here and we'll bring Samson out as sport to make fun of him and spit on him and do all these ugly horrible things to him so here's this little boy Samson can't see but we heard AJ his hair began to grow they weren't paying attention and his hair had just started to grow just a little bit and as they began to grow he tells them take me to the pillar and there all the Lords of the Philistines are and they take him and he puts his left hand on one pillar his right hand on another he boughs his head to the Lord he says Lord one more time just one more time Lord let your spirit come upon me and let me fulfill the very purpose you made me for Lord and there's Samson in the midst of those pillars boughs his head and the last words that he says is he says let me die with the Philistines and he pulls those pillars apart with all his might they all come crashing down and they kill everybody there and that was the day that God delivered the felis the Israelites out of the hands of the Philistines was that day and see you find an important story here is that the god of those times I am so glad AJ read that scripture God is the same yesterday today and forever because the same God that was with Sampson if you look around you see that he is the same God of today he's here with us aren't you glad that you could feel the Spirit of the Lord every
