one to the Lord this evening [Applause] let's turn into our Bibles the opening scriptures the book of Ephesians chapter one if it if episode and it reads like this Paul an apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of God to the Saints which which art Ephesus and to the faithful in Christ Jesus Pablo Apostle De Jesus Christan an episode Grace be unto you and peace from God our Father and from the Lord Jesus Christ Gracia is blessed be the God and father of our Lord Jesus Christ who had blessed us with all spiritual blessings in Heavenly places in Christ celestiales according as he had chosen Us in him before the foundation of the world that we should be holy and Without Blame before him in love Santos is having predestinated us unto the adoption of children by Jesus Christ to himself according to the good pleasure of his will and amore and again that title was the dark room the adoption is there are messages I mean sakis that we are get very enthused when we hear them we get very excited then there are other messages amen now to the word adoption la palabra adoption it means to maintainer to support a support to draw close relation a word of position it's tremendous when I when I read this instrument I'm gonna read it again adoption adoption let me ask the question first how many of you want to be adopted no one in his right mind no organ foreign would not would be crazy really not to be one not to be or want the adoption so we all want to be adopted but how many know in here that there is a law of adoption so right away it has to clear from your mind that if you're predestinated you're gonna be adopted and a lot of people just think it in under those terms now that's that's nice I would like to think like that you start up in sarasi but it has more than that a lot of people say God is good how many believe God is good he is good yes but he's also a consuming fire amen so then our faith that we have is based on the Virgin birth of the Lord Jesus Christ is that right our faith is based on that is on the Virgin birth of the Lord Jesus Christ amen now we understand that Jesus Christ Jesus Christ when he was born the Virgin had no relations with the menaciones amen you understand that all right now I want to hear an amen to see if you're awake I don't want to hear a lot of amends because I want you to learn but our our faith and I know you you've heard this maybe since you were a child I've heard many things since I was a child but not really understood them and I'm barely understanding a little bit about the Virgin birth amen so then we understand that the birth of Jesus Christ it came straight from the mind of God amen amen now to get your attention so I can base myself it comes from the mind of God's mind God's Minds thought it and that's how it came yes but it didn't it did not just come by him thinking he had to express it and for him to express it alone he had to have a vessel to express it through but it was virgin birth foreign is that right this was correct did Jesus cause a massacre yes he caused the massacre song because there came men to inquire about it and when they did they killed all the children from two years under mataron he caught the great Massacre and was rejected back in the Book of Genesis of the Genesis we find a person by the name of Abel in contramos and we know that his brother killed him I want you to notice his brother killed him now watch we're dealing with adoption his brother killed him but God substituted something there is something there and gave them Seth is it said amen now Jesus Jesus was our substitute in Calvary I want to get your attention to something Jesus was our substitute Jesus nuestro substituto in Calvary in calvario you know when he went to Calvary he couldn't hardly wait to get to Calvary is that true that's false is and that's where we're going to hit on adoption the life of Jesus has to be our life same life Miss mavida not another spiritu the same life la misma vida when Jesus Cameo Jesus Vino I hope you get this first partes so that you can understand where I'm going when Jesus Cameo Jesus did he know everything no he did not no no the Bible says that he grew in wisdom and stature is amen now when he grew in this stature amen he he had to come to a Crossroad in his ministry and when he came to this crossroadsero he was met by a propheta is that right now I want you to know I want you to make sure you know because a lot of people think they know it and they don't really know it and that's why we have some so much problem in the church so much confusion there should be no confusion but was he met by a propheta he sure did and what was the name of that Prophet his name was John is that right I'm just going to talk as long as I can now what did the prophet do to Jesus he washed him is that right it says correcto did he wash him did he baptize him in the river was according to the law wasn't the sacrifice had to be washed and you know when when John saw him the Bible says he forbade him which means he resisted him this is but what were the words of Jesus Jesus I want you to watch these words so you can understand your Bible it becometh us to fulfill all righteousness amen in other words John Juan if I don't give the people the examples then they don't have to be washed and everybody has to be washed if they're coming into adoption is that right all right I mean now we're going through kindergarten get to elementary secondary amen then to get to high school now when when we see this we we become we become Alertos well I I I can say for myself it rings a bell with me and I say if Jesus being the worst Jesus had to fulfill his own words how much you and I cuanto now remember he was the word whereas and he said it becometh us amen amen all right so then right away she put you Alertos correct alert us amen now when he was being baptized and he came out of the water is the Bible says that the heavens opened where the heavens closed thank piensen on the half hour of Silence he said the heavens opened Los Cielos and Out of Heaven this is my beloved Son Amado in whom I am pleased to dwell in in case [Applause] is that right is this correcto this is my beloved Son Amado now did I read that scripture correct Ura correcto hear you him did he tell him hear him in his baptism did I really correctly correct I want you to watch your Bible did I read it correct correct let's go to the scripture you see people can sit in church and say Amen to just anything the heavens open let's go to Matthew 3 I believe around there 17. this is yeti and lower voice from Heaven saying this is me my beloved Son in whom I am well pleased all right now watch carefully your Bible amen now when he was baptized he was accepted as a Son of God foreign now when he was baptized was he adopted right there no way no message don't show that tell me but when he was baptized he right there the voice came the acceptance what if Jesus had not gone into the water he would never have fulfilled scriptures but it becometh us to fulfill all righteousness all right now since we we're we're going a little let's I got you thinking and I want you to think I don't care to hear a lot of amends but if you say amen that's all right now when he was baptized immediately he was tried for a provado in the desert is that right now before I continue this I have here the stature of a perfect man perfecto this is the stature of a perfect man perfecto when he was tested provado aqui I trespasses ification El bautism is that right yes correcto amen oh Bueno a man a man all right you're born again and a lot of people right there much the majority of the people in this message they think that that's it this is born again try your hair so much confusion and Chaos in the message churches one says one thing the other one says another thing and my goodness it is is just a big mess is amen now he was trying for a provado why was he tried the devil said this if you are the son of God let these Stones turn to bread how many times has that gone through your mind are you a Son of God are you a daughter of God maybe I'm not possibly no soy every one of you that that this thought has crossed you one time or the other how do you know these days well I believe that brother's the Son of God but I don't believe I am one so then when when the trial comes what must you do okay you won't know what to do sir unless you yourselves follow the Bible and follow what Jesus what happened to Jesus then you can start patterning your life if thou be the Son of God you you at this point when you accept the Lord you and you're born again you must find your identity you know you hear people saying that brother thinks he's that I'll kill him but I don't believe he's there if that brother would take more time to find out who he is he won't have to worry about the other brothers but we worry too much about who is who and who is not uh OS is that right yes it's correct and that's not adoption I preached the word I'm not safe because I'm a preacher you know I preach because I love the Lord and and that's that's why I do it I have to work my salvation amen through fear and trembling foreign all right slowly let's pass you three years passed then came Mount Transfiguration three years after his baptism when he was transfigured or or went up the mountains he took with him three Witnesses is that right is correct watch closely I preached at least 100 messages on adoption but this is the first one this will really open it up if you follow it three Witnesses and when they were there with him the Bible says that he was transfigured he said transfigurado and two beans came out of another Dimensions they weren't here but they appeared From Another Dimension it was Moses and Elijah Moises now the three Witnesses they knew the story about Moses and Elijah they had read the Scrolls containing the law that Moses had brought amen so they knew about them can you imagine they're feeling when they saw these two beings can you imagine think for a while and then appears another great personage and then another great personage appear right by him but not just any person is two great persons personas from another Dimensions comes into this dimensions And when they see them this is the way Peter James and John they were like this I can imagine they were like this and Peter Pedro being bold um yeah karpas thanks let's make three tents one for Moses one for Elijah no palias one for Jesus and before yantes where they could say anything else came from Heaven is that right is this correct and we know the story and the voice said this is this is my beloved Son in whom I am pleased to dwell in and came in here is that right so it's correcto prophet of God said that he was adopted right here let me go back and let me give you the definition of adoption again to maintainer maintenance to support to draw close relations a word of position I don't know I don't know if you understand this I don't know if you're understanding this is but if you have read adoptions you're going to understand what I'm saying he was adopted that means he was supported he was became a close relationship and he received the word opposition now now remember prophet of God says he says we must find our position he says also this he was our ranks rangos rank ranko let's see ranks how many have been in the Army I never was in the Army but I was in the Navy if we Marino and they have you know you start out they give you one stripe naraya that's a recruit and then they give you another one an apprentice and they give another one a semen then you're going to a petty officer and he says give us our ranks now watch Guida who was adopted here Peter James Santiago Jesus Christ was adopted yes right here akimero it it was showing that God had placed all his confidence in him and then the confidence that God had in him Jesus he deposited and Jesus all the confidence now how would you like Como Les gustara that God would put all his confidence in you that's what you want I haven't hit what I want to hit yet I haven't hit the message yet giving you down here a little bit to to to add to it or to build on it now everything that godhead he had put it in him all right he had his position do you think I have a position if I didn't have a position I won't be pastor of this church amen amen do you have a position there in the benches sure you have a position but the thing is do you know your position all right follow it closely now foreign the father el padre never said hear me did the father say that no he says here ye him closely hear ye him oh but I'll hear Jesus but I won't hear nobody else Jesus you don't want to hear my message this evening foreign the father never said hear me [Music] and when Peter heard this James they came from the mountains they were up in the mountains these were the words of Jesus Jesus tell the vision to no man this is until the son of man be risen again watch father George in your Bible watch all right now here we come into the delicate part okay Hebrews 5 let's find out what kind of a man que class de hombre was Jesus Christ that he got adopted you want to find that out because if you find out what kind of a man he was that's exactly the kind of person you and I have to be people say impossible impossible yeah for you it is because porque a lot of people say I can never be like God this is then you'll never be in the Rapture because the sixth step of the stature is to be like godliness is to be like God is we sing it locantamos but you know what we don't believe and the people say oh those people they think they are as good as Jesus Christ well I'll tell you one thing you'd better be or you won't be in the rapture you got to have the stature all right let's go and see what kind of a man Jesus Christ was all right you love the Lord 30 will start in this Sunday School Hebrews five and five Hebrews 5 5. so also Christ glorified not himself to be made in high priest was he high priest and foreign yes he was high priest but did he call himself high priest no also Christ glorified not himself to be made in high priest but he that said unto him Thou Art my son today have I begotten thee they know as he said also in another place thou are a priest Forever After the order of melchizedeke is he a high priest foreign foreign to you by the time I finish with this is you might say oh that's boring message you know he don't bother me because I have a message to preach I'm a preach it is interesting I was up till three o'clock this morning what if the whole ministerial body Silver City Silver City never recognizes me as a minister in this town it don't bother me a bit as long as I have the order of Melchizedek foreign that's the order we should look foreign that's what we should look foreign [Music] what good will it do me if I'm known as the great pastor and the whole ecclesiastical body has me here and they speak real good of men what good will he do it and I never hear escucho this is my son the adoption your pastor cannot give it to you I cannot give it no Apostles it's an individual Affair between God foreign [Music] amen when in the days of his flesh siete five seven when in the days of his place when he had offered up prayers and supplications with strong crimes and tears unto him that was able to save him from death and was heard in that he feared miedo question pregunta there's a lot of people I ain't scared today liarsos I'm not calling you liars I'm saying when people say that spirit is Jesus Christ this is the way some Churches sing down at the cross they want to make it boogie boogie you know down at the cross where my savior died he didn't go that way he was down at the cross where am I say singing a boogie boogie woogie stuff that's nonsense he never went like that he was in fear that's right he was in fear foreign that's why it says here foreign there are things I caused us that you will not do okay because of your flesh your flesh your flesh gets in the way amen amen but when you receive the acceptance of God [Music] born again you're Born Again In the Flesh that flesh came through the will of your mother and father is born of the spirit of the spirit a Son of God to be expressed is it expressed yet all right here's the problema in the churches in lahilexia praise God I accepted the message I got the statue of perfect yes who taught you those lies the way we act shows this is to help you the Lord told me to deliver this message watch verse eight versicolocho though he was a son he wants a son he yet learn he obedience by the things which he suffered foreign opinions obedencia some of you young children here don't even know how to respect your daddy and mama let alone God idios I've had people tell me in my face it's none of your business and they're obedient and then they tell me I love Jesus as much as you do it is but they never learn opinions what Jesus did though he were a son yet learn he obedience by the things which he suffered and being made perfect no and being made perfect he became the author of Eternal salvation unto all them that obey him he is foreign after the order of Melchizedek says amen being made perfect siendo perfecto Matthew 26 Mateo says and I don't think my Bible has Matthew 26. my goodness Matthew 26 38. says right or study foreign Spanish Jesus Hasta la Muerte aqui ivelar conmigo here he is praying here he is praying akiesta Orlando my soul is exceeding sorrowful triste how many of you are how many of you feel lonely that's the way Jesus felt my soul is exceeding sorrowful even unto death 39. he went a little farther fell on his face and prayed saying oh my father hmm let this cup pass from me how many times in our Christian up now I know I'm speaking way up here by your way down here you don't understand potatoes what I'm saying but how many times in our Christian walk when we come to a certain place is that right it was correctober father s for me he prayed that but inside of him he already had the confidence he was appointed for support he was a relation he had the mechanics inside of him then when his flesh feared he was afraid in other words inside of him was a greater power was an adoption Tower and the power settings nevertheless foreign we think we're High Mighty people you know flashing up and inside of us we're a valley of dry bones that's why I don't judge a man after his flesh judges Spirit who's got to a spirit see what he's trying to watch he comes to the disciples find them asleep could you not watch with me one hour watch and pray that you enter not into temptation okay no interest and they asked the question can a man be born again and have an abortion okay absolutely absolutely unless he has this stature in him let me tell you something you're going to need this you're going to need all this inside of you to be able to pass the hour of Temptation here's Jesus Christ his brain is the hour of Temptation foreign all right but inside the radentro was an adoption adoption when he came back the second time his disciples were sound asleep to disciples and you watch and pray for you know not when he comes one of these days honestos Diaz like a snare he'll come come on gotta help us 41 watch and prayer that you enter not into temptation the spirit indeed is willing but the flesh is weakness was he showing that he was weak in the flesh was he estaba when Paul wrote to the Hebrews he said that in the days of his flesh he feared all right 42. he went again the second time again you talk about you talk about asking for permissiveness because a lot of people you hear them say oh what did you say purpose what'd you say first okay this is the same thing I'm going to enter into permissiveness Jesus Christ Let It Be permissiveness let it be what you want bye but you think praise God o my father if this cup may not pass away from me pasa except I drink it thy will be done and he came and found them I'll sleep again and he left them no 44 I'm sorry and prayed the third time saying the same words palabras and you know you read this and you read it you know laying and you don't know what it means until you come to it that's right as the party because there are things today I caused us in oyendia that are hard to swallow okay and what's it what's he doing killing matando for this hour verse 40 I read that 45 back to Hebrews I'm going to skip that I'm gonna go to John 1 Juan Uno you love the Lord we don't get too boring for you okay no yeah he learned amen amen the Bible says he was obedient I mean he didn't want to do it are you catching it I mean are you really catching he did want to do it but he didn't go by these feelings there was something greater in him and he obeyed it hello medicine you hear a lot of junk going on and you feel like just like they say it's all Italian I can't throw the towel I've come this far I'm gonna go even if I go to my death in obedience some people say you're crazy that's Loco I might be crazy then I would have to say what kind of a man was Jesus Christ when he was in the flesh he went to pray and three times see and see their adoption is now aura how Como do I get this you can just go and pray and says Lord God give me this well the first step is to pray but you find people that are always praying you know you people usually pray for the same thing foreign do you think that a person that has this has to repentance no you repent down here when you have this you have the stature you don't have to pray Lord I Repent I'm sorry yes Lord I'm sorry why are you sorry it's not time
