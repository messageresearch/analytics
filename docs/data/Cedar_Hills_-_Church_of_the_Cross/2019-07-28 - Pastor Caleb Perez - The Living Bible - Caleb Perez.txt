somebody shouting in the spirit tau malice greed hatred all those things are in the church and you know what the world's hungry for the world wants to see something genuine that's what's the matter these conversions of the circle they're not real conversions it's interaction there's an intellectual knowledge of Christ but a born-again experience gives the real cry on America is people who have to be entertained they've got too much television in them they want entertainment they can't face the old-fashioned gospel they said we can go over here it isn't so rough we can do what we want you go ahead but my sheep hear mob you know that's true oh how God bless the church offer to you huh virtue as the hymn desert brood but you would not you listen to man leaders instead the Holy Spirit leaders units demand teachers instead of God's teacher the Holy Ghost who would teach you behavior make you behave yourself nice they keep you lady life make you the salt of the earth the salt creates a thirst and man appears to be like you if you'll really live the Christian life you can't do it in yourself you've got the head of Christ in you to do it the world is one with some genuine that's the reason they see people that claim to be something and going out acting like the rest of the world that's what calls communism to rise in Russia or a town the Catholic Church dr9 claiming to be something and has no more accident done just like the world no more than any other Raj not only Catholic but Protestant just as bad and it's come down home to the Pentecostals I confessed in fashion and looking talking life's meaning making fun and different that's wrong but it's good for you the Jews but that's reason the way of Casey nothing genuine when the people comes to a place that they forget all the little differences and the love of God will shed abroad in our hearts by the real teacher the Holy Ghost you'll become salty and the world will be like you you create a creation around you you've seen people you couldn't stand to be around yet they were nice people they create that within themselves you've seen people you love to be with because they create that atmosphere around them your spirit your soul you can't hide it you can't make bleep that's what's the matter today there is too much make believe in Christianity [Music] hi my well no wonder the holy spirit didn't let
