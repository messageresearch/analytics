[2:07] father we pray as we study the power of
[2:11] demons and what they do to people that
[2:13] you will give us great faith and made
[2:15] many great signs and wonders d-roc for
[2:18] we asked it in Christ's name and for
[2:21] God's glory amen
[2:24] where our study this afternoon quickly
[2:27] into it I get about 15 minutes early is
[2:30] still on demonology and I just got a
[2:33] message a while ago brother Baylor from
[2:35] my friends and start in Africa the
[2:38] middle of July so that settles that we
[2:41] got a fish down and brother Baxter can't
[2:43] go at that time so grab go to Africa by
[2:45] myself so going over there but maybe
[2:48] though yet to pray for me now that the
[2:50] Lord will help me well I really go to
[2:52] need it now over there amongst I'm
[2:54] expecting at least 200,000 people in
[2:58] that meeting and I've got a vision road
[3:00] out here I won't do to people just the
[3:02] benefit of it
[3:03] it happens in December I was in the room
[3:07] one morning when the angel the Lord came
[3:09] in I you see when I was over there I
[3:12] just obeyed God and I picked up amoeba a
[3:15] man naught amoeba is a parasite that
[3:18] gets near the kid
[3:19] and because I'd done something God told
[3:21] me not to do how many's heard the story
[3:23] of it I guess somebody's here I know the
[3:25] folks around the tabernacle heard the
[3:26] story of what happened God told me to go
[3:29] a place and to stay away from this place
[3:31] and then go back over to another place
[3:32] and I'll let the preachers talk me out
[3:34] of it
[3:35] preachers are wonderful and they're my
[3:37] brothers but you mind what God tells you
[3:40] that's Ryan Smith you got one mission
[3:42] how many remembers one time there's two
[3:44] prophets in the Bible and one of them
[3:45] the Lord Twigg did you go to a certain
[3:47] place and don't choose don't you come to
[3:50] you go back another way and so forth of
[3:52] them and said don't you I eat or drink
[3:54] while you're there and another true
[3:56] prophet met him and said the Lord met me
[3:58] after he met you and said come to my
[3:59] house and the Prophet listen to what the
[4:02] other and said and lost his life I see
[4:04] you do what God tells you to do
[4:06] regardless or what anybody else says now
[4:09] we're in this vision he it woke me up
[4:14] 13th of September December and as I was
[4:18] sitting on the side of my bed I was
[4:19] wondering what would be my future I want
[4:23] to come back over here there's rays
[4:24] throw me in a pest house parasites that
[4:26] just stopped taking me and they give me
[4:29] examination when I struck this land and
[4:31] by God's grace this let me go home
[4:34] because it's very scattered and I prayed
[4:37] and I went to those ministry so the Lord
[4:39] said me not to go that way so all God
[4:40] talks somebody besides you I said Cora
[4:43] had that idea one time offend them so
[4:45] but I went and got some leaves and laid
[4:48] it over their feet and I said remember
[4:49] in the name of the Lord if we take that
[4:52] trip there it's going to be a failure
[4:53] and we'll all pay for it and we sure did
[4:56] a hole we're all like to die so then
[4:59] coming back you have so much to contend
[5:02] with in those foreign countries for
[5:04] instance a little flea would bite you it
[5:06] calls you have tick fever and that
[5:08] little thing when it bites you if you
[5:10] feel yourself sitting you can't scratch
[5:12] it you're looking with the little black
[5:14] fellow don't pull it off it's got a
[5:15] little head it bores its way into the
[5:17] skin turns around like this and fastens
[5:20] itself but you'd pull it you'd pull the
[5:22] head off in there it's got a virus thing
[5:23] of the paralyzed you so you don't
[5:26] scratch or don't pull him all just take
[5:28] some towel and he breezed through he's
[5:30] back drop towel aren't and it comes off
[5:32] Mesquita he doesn't make a bit of noise
[5:34] he comes right through the air you just
[5:36] touch it that's all you've got malaria
[5:39] and then there's what they call the
[5:41] Mumbai snake if he hits you you live
[5:44] just about 2 minutes at your any issue
[5:46] and there's a yellow Cober you live
[5:49] about 15 minutes after his bike and one
[5:51] of us close enough to my son is he could
[5:53] ladies hand on his head already up to
[5:54] strike before we got the shot like that
[5:56] and there's the black hole bro there's
[5:58] just everything and then the wild perils
[6:00] of the animals of course line tiger or
[6:02] leopards and everything else to contend
[6:06] with in the jungle and then their
[6:07] diseases is this all kinds of diseases
[6:09] in there and you have all that to face
[6:12] when you go beside that and here's the
[6:13] witch doctor to challenge you oh never
[6:15] hand thing and all their superstitions
[6:18] and things but how or what a marvelous
[6:20] thing to see our Lord just wave it away
[6:22] from side to side like I ain't going and
[6:24] that day I remember standing there how
[6:27] well what taking place I'll tell you
[6:30] sometime in another meeting cause I want
[6:32] to get almost subject this afternoon of
[6:34] demonology but now in this I was
[6:37] thinking about singer what will the end
[6:39] beam and we're coming back across the
[6:42] sea I know we had around a hundred
[6:44] thousand conversions while we was in
[6:46] there my old brother Bosworth come to me
[6:49] said I said well brother Bosworth he
[6:51] said I'm so proud of you brother branham
[6:53] he said you're just you're just the
[6:55] beginning of life I said well I guess
[6:58] it's all over I said I'm past forty
[7:00] years old and I guess I fought a good
[7:01] fight and finished the course he said
[7:03] past 40 years old today's that old four
[7:05] I got converted said I'm still going
[7:07] good he was prettier going into his 80
[7:10] just I thought well maybe that's about
[7:12] right so he said no you're just a brand
[7:15] new brand and now you just know how to
[7:16] control your meetings better than
[7:17] everything said just if you ever strike
[7:19] America in its right way to the right
[7:21] set up meeting where you could stay six
[7:22] or eight weeks in a place and get it set
[7:24] up an advertised around said you do
[7:26] something but and for our Lord so we
[7:29] went ahead just on like that so it was
[7:31] very very nice then takes a while I saw
[7:34] a vision when I was an American had come
[7:36] to me and return me back to Africa and
[7:38] it showed me that same meeting sitting
[7:41] there in front of Durban in the first
[7:42] meeting faded away into history going
[7:44] towards the west
[7:45] the
[7:46] second meeting rolls up and when it did
[7:48] it was still larger than the first
[7:49] meeting look and he her scream and an
[7:52] angel was coming out of heaven they had
[7:54] a great light and the age of the Lord
[7:56] which stands by Cheverus that always
[7:58] stands by my right over on this side and
[8:00] they were standing and it was it was
[8:02] milling around and I've seen this one
[8:04] man standing armies he's not now that's
[8:06] not vision when you see him it's just as
[8:09] real as you're looking at maybe y-you
[8:11] can hear him walk and talk to you and
[8:13] when he anything it just is really it's
[8:16] not a vision the man is just standing
[8:17] there just same as you are his voice is
[8:20] just the same as mine would be or yours
[8:21] to be but a vision something breaks
[8:24] before he and you see it like that but
[8:26] this man is Falk something stands ever
[8:28] so he told me that what was going to
[8:31] take place and he said that this angel
[8:34] came down and he told me to turn and
[8:37] look this away and it looked towards you
[8:38] India now now I don't say it's in India
[8:40] but it's near but they were Indian
[8:44] people called the Africans or big burly
[8:46] heavy fat like people some of them in
[8:49] nearly seven foot tall weights or 280 or
[8:52] 300 pounds burly Zuma's now the shunga
[8:55] the suta and all these many different
[8:57] tribes there's 15 different tribes
[8:59] sitting there that day I was speaking to
[9:00] I'd save one word like Jesus Christ the
[9:03] Son of God I'd go get a drink of water
[9:05] pour it went through all interpreters
[9:06] wanted sake and all noises I used to
[9:09] think when I heard Pentecostal people
[9:11] speaking in tongues that maybe one
[9:13] speaking in one kind of sound and one
[9:14] speaking other how the world could that
[9:15] be but I'll be the vitals right and
[9:18] orders or said there's not a sound
[9:19] without significance
[9:21] some of them would say one of them go
[9:23] blue blue blue blue that met Jesus
[9:26] Christ the Son of God I go not the Jesus
[9:29] Christ the Son of God in his language so
[9:31] no matter what kind of sound it is it's
[9:33] the meaning somewhere that's on no
[9:35] matter what type of noise it is it means
[9:37] something to someone somewhere and when
[9:40] he was a they'd give that out and I
[9:43] noticed that over to my left when that
[9:47] angel came down and I seen a swarm like
[9:49] there and there were a man with looked
[9:51] like they had a sheet around him like it
[9:53] and it wrapped up and tied like around a
[9:56] small baby the napkin and it was
[9:59] now I could just see as far as I could
[10:01] see with other people and then this
[10:03] angel turned on a great oscillating
[10:05] light and it began to sway back and
[10:07] forth like that and I never seen so many
[10:09] people in my life and then this other
[10:12] angel came real close to me and he said
[10:14] these 300,000 of them in that meeting
[10:17] now I've got it written down here you
[10:20] write it in some kind of piece of paper
[10:22] like I told about the little boy been
[10:24] resurrection Finland you write that on
[10:26] the Flyleaf or your Bible or somewhere
[10:27] and in this meeting there is going to be
[10:29] a meeting and you'll hear through some
[10:31] outlet of 300 thousand people attend
[10:36] that meeting that's it that is not that
[10:38] would be three times the size the other
[10:39] month see three hundred thousand people
[10:42] to attend the meeting and I'm just so
[10:44] happy to get to get there I don't know
[10:46] what to do for I like to win souls to
[10:48] our Lord and there at one time seeing
[10:51] seeing thirty thousand raw heathens come
[10:55] to Jesus Christ someone over call thirty
[10:59] thousand are all hidden now let's go to
[11:03] our subject right quick yesterday we
[11:06] studied the Technic of demons I've been
[11:09] thinking today as God dealing you don't
[11:12] know what a liberty it is to get out now
[11:14] I'm not a teacher I'm a long waist and
[11:16] being a bible expositor and i am my
[11:22] education is limited to a seventh grade
[11:25] so that's and that i come out of school
[11:27] about twenty-five years ago so that's a
[11:30] long time all and the oh not have very
[11:33] much of an education but all that I know
[11:36] is water received through inspiration
[11:38] and if that inspiration doesn't compare
[11:41] with the Bible then it's wrong see it's
[11:43] got to be the Bible no matter what
[11:45] inspiration it is it's got to come here
[11:47] is God's foundation no other foundations
[11:51] laid but this and what this is if what I
[11:55] would say would be contrary to this you
[11:57] let my words be alive because this is
[11:59] the truth see see and if an angel would
[12:02] tell you something it would be different
[12:04] than this pulsar letting be unto you a
[12:05] curse even an angel of light now there's
[12:10] many great things only the only
[12:13] two days calls to get this subject to
[12:16] the people that was yesterday and today
[12:19] of the afternoon meetings now the reason
[12:24] I did this is to give myself a little
[12:27] try to see if God would help me there's
[12:29] something all my heart and this is that
[12:33] actually this great message and after
[12:35] God Himself confirming what as I have
[12:39] said to be the truth in his word by his
[12:42] word first and then through signs and
[12:44] wonders now I think with the gospel
[12:46] truth to the church I'm under obligation
[12:49] to God to bring this to the church
[12:51] that's right there so broke up and so
[12:54] many different organizations and
[12:56] sectarian parts of it so that's wrong
[12:59] we're all God's children when we're born
[13:02] again that's the thing and the truth of
[13:04] the thing is that God wants us to know
[13:06] that that we're his children now
[13:08] remember the Temple of Solomon must cut
[13:10] out all over the world and here comes
[13:12] one Rock twisted this way and one Rock
[13:14] twisted that way one cut up this when
[13:15] one cut that way but when it come
[13:17] together
[13:18] there wasn't a buzz of assault or sound
[13:20] of the hammer everything went right to
[13:22] its place God was the instructor that
[13:25] God's got a church call this families
[13:27] them on the Church of God and ones of
[13:29] this and the wonder that but when they
[13:30] all come together there'll be one big
[13:32] group of brotherly love and God will
[13:35] hurt symbol that church together and
[13:37] take her on up into the sky ever famous
[13:40] picture before it's ever hung enough
[13:42] Hall of art it has to be hung go through
[13:45] the Hall of critics first the man who
[13:47] painted that gust or pardon me I can't
[13:51] call his new painting the Last Supper
[13:52] anyhow it cost him his life time he
[13:56] painted that picture there's about
[13:57] twenty years or ten years of lead
[13:59] between paint and Christ and Judas and
[14:01] did you realize that famous picture that
[14:03] the same man pulls for Christ
[14:05] ten years later pulls for Judas that's
[14:08] right it is ten years of sin from a
[14:11] great opera singer to take the place of
[14:13] Christ come to the place of Judas you
[14:16] don't have to take ten years to take ten
[14:17] minutes we'll do the same thing to you
[14:19] it'll change your character in sin but
[14:22] anyhow that picture went through all the
[14:24] critics and that's what I think about
[14:27] the gods church the group that's called
[14:29] well I don't mean this to any slam I've
[14:33] sailed the seven seas in a moment third
[14:36] trip around the world and the people say
[14:38] Holy Roller Holy Roller and I've
[14:39] searched the world and I've never found
[14:41] a Holy Roller yet that's a name that
[14:44] devil has tacked on to the people that's
[14:46] all there's no such a thing as the Holy
[14:49] Roller now I have statistics of ever 668
[14:52] different churches that there is an
[14:54] organized in the world is not what I'm
[14:56] called holy rollers that's from the
[14:59] government
[14:59] there's not one Holy Roller Church I
[15:01] know of so it's just something the
[15:03] devil's Hall but now and all of this all
[15:06] these things God has painted a picture
[15:09] and one time these little old churches
[15:14] used to be out here some of you I
[15:16] watched these gray-headed man my boy
[15:19] yesterday I was in the room studying and
[15:22] a minister came by and said like shake
[15:24] hands with your dad course my boys been
[15:26] raised up with brother Baxter now who
[15:28] just oh that's it quickly I don't like
[15:32] that see no matter if I of course I
[15:34] can't be serving a man in God too but I
[15:37] think I like to shake hands with my
[15:39] brethren I like to do that there's
[15:42] something about it I like to shake the
[15:44] hands of a minister not only a minister
[15:46] but any child of God I like to do it I
[15:49] didn't know about it until my wife had
[15:52] told me a little later well if he could
[15:54] have told that Minister just a minute
[15:55] he's back there in prayer and I'll see
[15:57] why didn't say well that that would have
[15:58] been better so I give him a little
[16:01] correction on that not to do that see
[16:04] and so on it's true you can't just be
[16:08] right out as the brother said a while
[16:10] ago if you do then at night time I'm
[16:13] worn you see the people go to talking
[16:15] and everyone has maybe a sickness and
[16:17] when they go to speaking about it
[16:19] quickly there's the angel of the Lord
[16:21] right there to tell about it there's
[16:24] someone said looking right at me now
[16:25] knows that to be true for mister few
[16:27] minutes ago or about a hour and a half
[16:29] ago a lady sitting here who didn't know
[16:32] what it was that the angel Lord spoke to
[16:34] her other night and told her something
[16:35] and she couldn't understand it but today
[16:37] it happened so she knows now what it
[16:39] means
[16:40] when he was speaking to her and how
[16:42] standing there talking to her the angel
[16:44] or butt right spit back out and told her
[16:45] what our trouble was and what was all
[16:47] about and and what she was thinking
[16:49] about one of her loved ones and how God
[16:51] had spoken said he'd confirmed it and
[16:53] what was going to take place so that's
[16:55] just exactly way it'll be see God has
[16:58] said so but now what about a few times
[17:01] that ever and then in each vision just
[17:04] weakens you that much more thing and the
[17:06] first thing you know when you get to
[17:07] church at night you're just so
[17:08] completely wore out here you just don't
[17:11] know hardly what to do and you pray for
[17:12] me now see because it's out of one
[17:15] meeting to another to another this was
[17:17] the only meeting it would be different
[17:18] if I was going home now bugs building up
[17:19] for a couple months
[17:20] well to get my fishing line and go
[17:23] fishing but I got to go from one meeting
[17:24] right to another from one right to
[17:26] another you see that's what makes it and
[17:28] you all pray you people back here in the
[17:30] audience they told me last night and the
[17:35] person who did not respond to the call
[17:38] that's pretty dangerous to see when is
[17:42] said it but sometimes these life don't
[17:44] shine is a dark spot in between there
[17:46] now watch the angel Lord when you're
[17:48] standing here I can feel it then I'll
[17:50] feel it moved from me now watching it'll
[17:52] leave me and it'll go over somewhere
[17:53] stand there a little bit I can see it
[17:55] it'll flash on and there be a vision
[17:57] come then I'll see the vision I'll watch
[17:59] what a kind of looking person it is
[18:01] around there I find the person and I
[18:02] speak that's what takes place that's
[18:04] what happens you don't have to tell
[18:05] everybody that but that's that's what
[18:07] takes place you see it's all in the
[18:09] spiritual rim then if that person don't
[18:11] respond and be like reading the Bible
[18:13] here and saying there's nothing to it
[18:14] walk away from it see so that makes it
[18:17] pretty bad so be on alert be listening
[18:19] be watching when he speaks answer he's
[18:23] just be ready to answer at any time and
[18:27] so my wife and brother of dealer and
[18:29] many of them this morning was telling me
[18:31] about it that it was calling a man
[18:33] bought his brother somewhere that had
[18:35] something wrong with him and so forth
[18:37] and the man did not respond to the call
[18:40] so that can't be helped that's between
[18:42] God and the man division left me then I
[18:44] couldn't find it no more because it
[18:46] didn't answer so be watching be on alert
[18:48] now I'm taking this subject of
[18:51] demonology and speaking about Dean
[18:54] now people when you say demon right
[18:56] quick they begin to thank or some
[18:58] fanaticism or something but demons is
[19:00] just as real as angels there are just as
[19:04] real and the devil is just as real a
[19:07] devil as Jesus Christ as the Son of God
[19:09] he's a devil heaven is just as real
[19:12] answer is no such a thing as hell
[19:14] there's no profession thing is heaven if
[19:15] there is the eternal blessed eternal
[19:18] punishment rather there's no eternal
[19:19] blast if there's the old days there's no
[19:23] night thank you but it sure there's a
[19:25] there's night if if there's as the
[19:28] church as a Christian there's bound to
[19:29] be a hypocrite if fears there's somebody
[19:31] that's genuine from God there's somebody
[19:33] to impersonate that see it's just
[19:35] exactly pro and con black and white
[19:37] right on down through life on everything
[19:39] true and false everywhere and there's
[19:42] the false gospel there's a true gospel
[19:45] there's a true baptism there's a false
[19:47] baptism there's a make belief and
[19:50] there's a real there's a true American
[19:52] dollar there's a false American dollar
[19:54] there's a genuine Christian there's a
[19:56] genuine hypocrite see it's just
[19:58] impersonating so will you find that so
[20:01] it all goes together now we can't
[20:03] separate it God lifts the rainfall may

[20:25] raise up your hands all around
[20:26] everywhere here all Pentecostals all
[20:29] right I'll tell you what I had when I
[20:31] first come into your room ring I Drive
[20:35] up here in Indiana at a certain place
[20:37] called Mishawaka the first group of
[20:39] Pentecostal people I've ever seen is
[20:41] called the the Pentecostal Assemblies of
[20:43] Jesus Christ I believe or something like
[20:45] a wonderful bunch of people now they
[20:49] organize together and call in United
[20:50] Pentecost they break up from the rest of
[20:52] the calls with an issue of water baptism
[20:54] that don't make them any hypocrites is
[20:58] many a genuine real genuine Holy Ghost
[21:01] born-again Christian in the ranks and
[21:03] God gave them the Holy Ghost but being
[21:06] baptized in Jesus name
[21:07] they give the others the babbage's the
[21:09] Holy Ghost in baptize and father son
[21:10] only go so God gives them the Holy Ghost
[21:13] to obey Him so who get who got who obey
[21:15] ting are you hard if you just forgetting
[21:20] them it wants to be one way let them be
[21:22] and you go ahead be brothers that's all
[21:23] don't what done it was breaking a month
[21:26] of breaking away see what is breaking
[21:28] tearing up breaking that Brotherhood

[2:01:02] yeah
[2:01:03] then those molecules jockey and
