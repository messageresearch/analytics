[37:01] viol give their special to the
[37:25] Lord
[37:33] hello oh okay there we go God bless you
[37:35] everyone so this uh special Bears a bit
[37:38] of an introduction and the reason being
[37:40] is that we're doing something a little
[37:41] bit different we've been anticipating
[37:44] and expecting this project to come to
[37:46] fruition and finally is here but uh a
[37:49] couple months back I talked to our
[37:50] pastor about an inspiration the lord
[37:52] gave me that is specifically designed
[37:55] for you all it is is a a labor of love
[37:58] on my behalf and it is a project where
[38:01] in short summary we would like to write
[38:04] a series of new hymns inspired and based
[38:07] entirely off of all of you so if you've
[38:10] ever had a scripture or a story or a
[38:12] message or a subject that you've always
[38:14] wanted a song about but you've never had
[38:16] one now is your time and so be
[38:19] meditating about this and thinking about
[38:21] it because uh I will be calling you
[38:24] soon and uh as we meet me together and
[38:27] we talk I'll get uh your what you would
[38:29] like and we'll transform it into a new
[38:32] hymn that we'll be able to sing here in
[38:34] church and uh and put forward for from
[38:36] now until until the end and so uh We've
[38:39] uh we've been composing a few pieces and
[38:42] we finally got one that's ready to go
[38:44] and uh the project is called The Ballad
[38:47] of Believers and so you all will be the
[38:49] ballad and it is specifically uh for you
[38:53] so on that note today's song is titled
[38:55] what is man and it was inspired by
[38:58] Psalms uh 8 3-9 and I might just read it
[39:01] here if we can go quickly but uh I would
[39:04] like to thank Seth and Felipe and Ruth
[39:07] for helping me compose this song I can't
[39:09] write music so uh I can only write
[39:11] lyrics but not compositions so I'd like
[39:13] to thank them and uh you know honestly
[39:16] everybody's ready why don't we just sing
[39:18] this thing and I'm sure you all have a
[39:19] Bible and you can read psalms 8 3-9 on
[39:21] your own but this piece is inspired by
[39:25] the psalmist David Avid and I like to
[39:28] look at this song like a connection
[39:30] between the two times we have David
[39:32] writing in the past talking about the
[39:34] great galaxies and everything that he
[39:36] would see then and we have me writing
[39:37] back to him here meeting him halfway and
[39:40] bringing what was then to now so I pray
[39:42] that this blesses you and uh and you
[39:44] enjoy
[39:49] [Applause]
[39:55] it
[39:59] when I look upon the Stars I see his
[40:04] glory that beauty is shining bright just
[40:07] like his
[40:09] face when I see the moon this great

[50:20] you what this precious blessed
[50:24] message that was brought by a prophet
[50:27] for by by a a major prophet for William
[50:31] BR by William Mariam
[50:34] brandham makes
[50:38] us the only Power that Satan has listen
[50:42] to
[50:44] this the only Power that Satan
[50:47] has is the one that we give
[50:51] him he has no more
[50:54] power the more that we
[50:57] know about
[50:59] ourselves and about our
[51:03] position less
[51:06] power will the enemy have to use against
[51:10] him we open the Bible in Hebrews chapter
[51:16] 10 verse
[51:23] one want to amp if I uh and bring a
[51:26] little bit more of
[51:29] information as
[51:33] Christians just just think about one
[51:37] thing one way or
[51:44] another the animal the the enemy has a
[51:47] grasp of our lives in one way or
[51:50] another some are going through pain
[51:53] through sufferings
[51:56] some are struggling in their
[51:59] marriage others their children are out
[52:01] in the
[52:03] world with others your econom is not so
[52:07] good it's one thing or
[52:10] another now imagine for a
[52:14] moment bringing the ministry of
[52:17] Joshua where God promises to
[52:21] Joshua and he tells him
[52:23] fight with with every
[52:26] battle he will have a
[52:30] victory and it will be Victory after
[52:32] Victory after
[52:34] victory until there is peace in the
[52:40] camp the Holy Spirit last year showed
[52:48] me I won't include you I'll I'll take it
[52:54] personal how I took this
[52:57] serpent a a black
[53:02] mamba and I grabbed it by its neck and
[53:05] and and I held
[53:07] it I took
[53:11] it and I took it out of a
[53:14] room and I threw it out
[53:21] far now think for a
[53:24] moment
[53:26] now I
[53:27] know that this belongs to the
[53:32] church when you say brother dieo you're
[53:35] speaking of the
[53:36] church yes
[53:38] brother because I'm speaking of
[53:41] myself I am the
[53:45] church the
[53:47] church it is not the four
[53:49] walls when I speak about the
[53:52] church in part I'm not speaking
[53:56] I'm speaking about
[53:59] myself when I saw that I took out the
[54:01] serpent out of this
[54:04] place taking it out of the
[54:07] church I was taking this serpent
[54:10] out out of the life of brother
[54:13] Diego and I'm telling you that if you
[54:17] believe this
[54:19] promise is also for
[54:22] you so that you can take Satan with your
[54:26] hand take him from the throat and take
[54:30] him
[54:31] out because that is a
[54:33] promise for the children of
[54:37] God I I I'm waiting on
[54:40] that and we we're beginning to see
[54:44] it if you could please
[54:51] stand Hebrews chapter 10
[54:54] verse1
[54:57] says says for the
[55:02] law having a shadow of good things to
[55:08] come I'll repeat it and please catch
[55:12] this for the
[55:16] law having a shadow of good things to
[55:20] come I will tell you a
[55:24] truth I love the word there Goods good
[55:27] things I love
[55:29] that because it's telling
[55:32] me something that belongs to
[55:36] me but the law it was only a
[55:40] shadow but through the
[55:43] shadow it can give me an
[55:47] understanding of what those goods are
[55:49] for
[55:52] me says and not the very image of the
[55:54] things
[55:58] can never with those sacrifices which
[56:00] they
[56:02] offer year by year
[56:06] continually make the comers there on to
[56:09] perfect let us
[56:11] pray Lord Jesus Christ very good
[56:14] morning Lord take
[56:17] control Lord teach
[56:19] us Beed us heal
[56:23] us restore us
[56:26] baptize
[56:28] us Lord that all this may be
[56:31] done for the honor
[56:33] and please take your
[56:36] seat if
[56:39] today you tell me
[56:42] brother I heard you preach
[56:45] today and I think I
[56:47] failed I
[56:51] failed I said
[56:53] Lord Lord give me
[56:56] Grace have mercy upon me and give me
[57:00] Grace
[57:01] Lord that they may see
[57:04] Christ because a
[57:07] Pulpit it's not for people to show
[57:10] themselves a
[57:13] Pulpit it's not for people to see what
[57:15] you have a
[57:17] Pulpit is for the people can see Christ
[57:22] can see
[57:23] Christ through those that play the
[57:26] violin to see
[57:29] Christ those that play the
[57:32] organ to see
[57:34] Christ through the one that's song
[57:36] leading
[57:38] then they will see
[57:40] Christ through the
[57:42] preacher if that is not
[57:45] achiev then we have
[57:48] failed the
[57:50] law having a
[57:53] shadow
[58:02] I'll take a character and I like Moses
[58:04] very
[58:06] much
[58:09] Carlos when I heard this
[58:15] brother a a question came came to
[58:19] me because
[58:23] Moses
[58:33] and I I I am
[58:38] wonder how he speaks about certain
[58:42] things a man that God has given him
[58:45] wisdom now
[58:50] Moses Not only was he a wise
[58:53] man when I see
[58:56] Moses I can see the
[58:59] ministry the
[59:02] greatest Ministry that has appeared in
[59:05] the old
[59:06] T there is not one like the ministry of
[59:09] Moses a
[59:12] man that produced more miracles a
[59:16] man that produced most
[59:19] signs me a
[59:21] man that that produced the most
[59:27] and the most
[59:28] wonders a
[59:31] man that could see
[59:35] things God showed this man
[59:38] heaven and he could bring things to
[59:41] Earth he saw in
[59:44] heaven but did you
[59:46] know this
[59:48] man he had a a
[59:52] disability this man
[59:55] he had a
[59:57] complex he was a
[1:00:04] stutter he he he he he spoke like
[1:00:08] this now you can
[1:00:11] imagine a man that brought all these
[1:00:14] wonders and and I ask
[1:00:19] myself God never healed
[1:00:23] him
[1:00:25] could God not heal
[1:00:27] Moses when God calls Moses he gives him
[1:00:31] the
[1:00:32] commission the first thing that Moses
[1:00:35] says he says
[1:00:40] Lord I I ask you that you send
[1:00:45] another I cannot
[1:00:48] speak I don't know how to
[1:00:50] speak send
[1:00:53] another when I read the
[1:00:55] Bible God tells
[1:00:58] Moses who who made the
[1:01:00] D who made the
[1:01:03] blind who made the
[1:01:05] death you
[1:01:07] know
[1:01:10] before when I saw a blind man from
[1:01:13] birth I would say it was the
[1:01:18] devil and the death they were born death
[1:01:22] oh it was the devil
[1:01:25] thanks to God for his
[1:01:27] Mercy because I see
[1:01:29] here that it was not the devil God Did
[1:01:33] It For
[1:01:35] What when they asked
[1:01:37] Jesus
[1:01:39] master who
[1:01:41] sinned for him to be blind his his
[1:01:45] parents no it was not his parents oh was
[1:01:49] it
[1:01:49] him it wasn't him either then who sinned
[1:01:54] and Jesus tells him neither his parents
[1:01:57] nor did he
[1:01:59] sin but these are the
[1:02:01] works that God
[1:02:04] predestined before the foundation of the
[1:02:06] world so that in the books it would be
[1:02:10] written that
[1:02:12] God gave sight to the
[1:02:15] blind from
[1:02:18] birth
[1:02:21] then if you young people
[1:02:25] if you have a
[1:02:28] limitation oh brother you know I'm I'm
[1:02:30] too skinny oh I'm too
[1:02:34] fat I'm Too Tall and I hit the
[1:02:37] door I'm too short
[1:02:40] brother this this and
[1:02:43] that that is not an
[1:02:45] excuse when you surrender yourself to
[1:02:48] God if God could
[1:02:51] use a man with a stutter
[1:02:55] a man with a
[1:02:59] disability a man with a physical
[1:03:03] disability how will he not be
[1:03:06] God how will God not use
[1:03:10] anyone
[1:03:11] surrender to his
[1:03:19] will God
[1:03:21] says that he takes
[1:03:25] that which is
[1:03:27] not to to to put to shame what
[1:03:31] is you know why God does
[1:03:34] that you know why God did not heal
[1:03:37] Moses being able to do
[1:03:39] it because God
[1:03:41] wanted that each
[1:03:44] time that Moses
[1:03:46] spoke he would
[1:03:48] remember that it was not him that it was
[1:03:52] God doing the work
[1:03:57] Hallelujah each time that Moses
[1:04:00] spoke he
[1:04:02] knew that he was a limited
[1:04:06] man but when he could rest in
[1:04:11] God he was not a man that was
[1:04:14] limited he was a
[1:04:18] God the Bible says he was a
[1:04:23] god I want us to go to the
[1:04:26] scripture we'll go to De
[1:04:29] Deuteronomy or excuse me we'll go to
[1:04:36] Exodus 4 verse
[1:04:40] 12 Exodus 4
[1:04:46] verse2 and the scripture
[1:04:53] says
[1:04:58] [Applause]
[1:04:59] God speaking to Moses says now therefore
[1:05:04] go now
[1:05:07] please this is not a a
[1:05:12] story this is a
[1:05:15] shadow this is what Diego
[1:05:18] Caston has to
[1:05:21] reflect there Moses reflected something
[1:05:25] it wasn't the image it was the
[1:05:28] shadow but that
[1:05:30] shadow projected an
[1:05:32] image for this
[1:05:35] time here is the very
[1:05:39] image here is the very
[1:05:42] image of what Moses reflected back
[1:05:50] there Exodus
[1:05:53] 4:12
[1:06:01] now there
[1:06:03] go I will be with thy
[1:06:10] mouth
[1:06:11] God he tells Moses
[1:06:15] go I will be with thy
[1:06:18] mouth now that was a
[1:06:22] shadow and if I am the image
[1:06:25] [Music]
[1:06:30] that makes me feel
[1:06:33] special it's what this
[1:06:36] message has brought to my
[1:06:39] life it makes me
[1:06:42] special brother Diego what are you
[1:06:44] talking
[1:06:47] about there is a special

[1:06:56] one that is
[1:06:59] special when the service

[1:07:13] purchased know that she is
[1:07:16] special I will be with thy
[1:07:19] mouth that was a

[1:07:34] temple and and she was being troubled
[1:07:36] and she suffered lots of
[1:07:38] bullying she could not have
[1:07:42] children and she came to the
[1:07:45] temple there was the the the priest
[1:07:50] Eli seeing that that
[1:07:52] lady
[1:07:56] and Eli says this this woman she got

[1:09:28] understand when God told Moses I will be
[1:09:30] with thy
[1:09:36] mouth I I have a
[1:09:39] question now I'll I'll tell you
[1:09:43] this perhaps I I may be
[1:09:46] wrong and if I
[1:09:50] am I would like to be
[1:09:52] corrected
[1:09:55] come with
[1:09:57] scriptures and tell me brother Diego
[1:09:59] that's not
[1:10:01] so come with the messengers and tell me
[1:10:04] brother
[1:10:05] Diego right because I being sincere in
[1:10:07] what I'm going to
[1:10:14] say it catches my attention here reading
[1:10:16] this the the the the story of
[1:10:20] Moses let us go to
[1:10:22] Exodus
[1:10:26] chapter
[1:10:52] 7 x
[1:10:56] Exodus
[1:11:01] 71 and let's read this
[1:11:05] together remember this is the
[1:11:09] Shadow and the Lord said unto
[1:11:18] Moses I have made thee a God to pharaoh
[1:11:26] and Aaron thy
[1:11:28] brother shall
[1:11:32] be thy
[1:11:35] Prophet not my
[1:11:37] Prophet it shall be thy
[1:11:39] Prophet not my
[1:11:41] Prophet because a prophet of
[1:11:44] God thus sayth the
[1:11:46] Lord my
[1:11:48] question
[1:11:49] Moses your brother Aaron shall be thy
[1:11:53] prophet
[1:11:56] then when Aaron would go before
[1:11:58] Pharaoh he would not go with us say Lord
[1:12:02] he would go and he would
[1:12:06] go Pharaoh th say Moses the the the god
[1:12:10] of Israel that I am has
[1:12:15] appeared let the people
[1:12:18] go wow
[1:12:21] wow now this was a
[1:12:27] Shadow because of
[1:12:29] this was the reason they killed
[1:12:33] Jesus when Jesus came onto the
[1:12:36] scene Jesus said my father and
[1:12:41] I the religious people said hold on hold
[1:12:44] on your father
[1:12:47] God and
[1:12:51] you you say he's your father your you
[1:12:53] are his
[1:12:54] son if God has a
[1:12:58] son and he would have to be another
[1:13:01] God Jesus that's that's that's a
[1:13:05] blasphemy and they took up Stones the
[1:13:07] Bible say to Stone
[1:13:10] him and Jesus says hold
[1:13:12] on is it not
[1:13:14] written in your law says that God God
[1:13:19] said ye are Gods ye are gods
[1:13:25] un to whom the word of God
[1:13:28] came then why do you want to kill
[1:13:30] me if the
[1:13:32] prophets whom the word
[1:13:36] came were were made
[1:13:38] Gods then why I that say my father and
[1:13:43] I you want to kill
[1:13:52] me this
[1:13:56] message it came from the mouth of
[1:14:00] God this
[1:14:02] message it was
[1:14:04] brought by a
[1:14:09] prophet and the word cannot be
[1:14:12] broken
[1:14:14] then if the word came to the
[1:14:18] prophet not just any
[1:14:21] Prophet but a major prophet
[1:14:24] a scriptural
[1:14:29] prophet and this message that came to
[1:14:32] the
[1:14:34] prophet made
[1:14:36] him a
[1:14:40] man that could tell a storm be
[1:14:44] still are you
[1:14:48] ready if this
[1:14:51] man bring squirrels into
[1:14:55] existence what what did it
[1:14:58] do what was it that made brother Brandon
[1:15:01] bring things for the
[1:15:03] message that was given unto
[1:15:06] him put him in
[1:15:11] position to be the first
[1:15:13] son of this
[1:15:17] generation as the wave offering the the
[1:15:19] first
[1:15:22] fruit
[1:15:24] the the first
[1:15:28] fruits what what made
[1:15:30] him tell me who can
[1:15:36] create who can
[1:15:38] create
[1:15:41] God it was not
[1:15:43] him it was
[1:15:47] God our in our
[1:15:49] messenger
[1:15:51] producing what the sh
[1:15:54] was pointing
[1:15:56] to now
[1:15:58] amen Amen
[1:16:00] brother brother but brother Bram is no
[1:16:02] longer here in this
[1:16:05] message that produced the same in a
[1:16:09] Prophet this message it
[1:16:12] came to brother
[1:16:15] Diego put your name
[1:16:18] there if you put it to your
[1:16:20] neighbor then you count yourself out
[1:16:24] if this message that came through a
[1:16:27] prophet put you in a
[1:16:29] position to speak the
[1:16:32] word now this
[1:16:35] message has come into my
[1:16:38] heart and has taken me to a
[1:16:41] position where I have
[1:16:44] brother it's my duty my obligation to
[1:16:48] produce the
[1:16:50] same that produced there
[1:16:54] because the
[1:16:55] shadow is what is what the shadow tells
[1:17:10] me and here goes
[1:17:12] Moses uh before
[1:17:16] Pharaoh I'll make a drama and perhaps
[1:17:18] I'll make you
[1:17:20] laugh so especially the young people can
[1:17:22] understand
[1:17:24] understand I not trying to mock any
[1:17:30] anybody did you
[1:17:33] know that
[1:17:35] Egypt and
[1:17:41] Pharaoh represented the The Crib of
[1:17:44] civilization in in that
[1:17:47] time
[1:17:52] pharaoh
[1:17:54] they believe he was the the the son of
[1:17:57] the god
[1:18:01] R and that made him a
[1:18:06] God because he was the son of a
[1:18:10] God and that's what the Egyptians
[1:18:13] believed so then
[1:18:16] Pharaoh he was the god in
[1:18:20] flesh he was the representative of their
[1:18:22] God
[1:18:23] before the people of
[1:18:25] isra he was a
[1:18:28] God he had on his right
[1:18:32] hand all the witches and
[1:18:37] magicians the little which you see there
[1:18:40] that reads cards
[1:18:49] no real
[1:18:51] deal prove that to
[1:18:55] you go to the scripture in
[1:19:02] Exodus chapter 7 verse
[1:19:06] 9 I want to take off but I can't this is
[1:19:11] important uh chapter 7 verse
[1:19:14] 9 and here's God
[1:19:18] speaking when Pharaoh shall speak unto
[1:19:21] you show a miracle for
[1:19:26] you
[1:19:28] Pharaoh when Moses
[1:19:33] comes coming saying he's representing I
[1:19:38] am Pharaoh understands the
[1:19:41] language if we're speaking of
[1:19:45] gods here we're not including the human
[1:19:50] race because there's no virtue or power
[1:19:53] in
[1:19:54] them Moses you come with your God I have
[1:19:59] mine show me a
[1:20:01] miracle show me your
[1:20:03] God show me the power of your God and
[1:20:07] there it
[1:20:09] says when Pharaoh challenges
[1:20:12] Moses Moses throws the
[1:20:15] rod comes a
[1:20:19] serpent what a miracle what what a sign
[1:20:27] baroh didn't have
[1:20:28] hair I told he'd make you
[1:20:35] laugh this is a waste of time
[1:20:39] Moses you six come over
[1:20:41] here those that had their
[1:20:46] rod they they would they would throw
[1:20:50] their they turned into serpents
[1:20:53] but
[1:20:54] listen because this is a fight it's a
[1:20:58] battle and the idea is to Prevail to
[1:21:03] Prevail to Prevail
[1:21:05] is that when someone is
[1:21:08] fighting he that can
[1:21:10] withstand is the one who will
[1:21:14] win there was five six against
[1:21:18] one here comes Moses
[1:21:21] serpent he says Moses don't get nervous
[1:21:24] calm
[1:21:25] down leave this to
[1:21:29] me and he get all of
[1:21:34] them ask Pharaoh if he has more because
[1:21:36] I'm still
[1:21:38] hungry Barrow he was he he couldn't
[1:21:41] speak he was
[1:21:43] speechless
[1:21:46] hey come throw down
[1:21:49] all and I imagine these magicians
[1:21:54] and they all threw down their
[1:21:57] rods and the serpent there eating each
[1:22:01] one of
[1:22:02] them the serpent tell it tells
[1:22:06] Moses there's another 50
[1:22:09] there Pharaoh got got angry he got
[1:22:12] angry because the sign of
[1:22:15] Moses
[1:22:17] prevailed before The
[1:22:20] Magicians this is where the challenge
[1:22:22] begins
[1:22:24] when
[1:22:25] Moses makes the first
[1:22:28] sign I'm bringing
[1:22:31] Revelation when he does the first
[1:22:34] sign he turns the water into
[1:22:37] blood the The
[1:22:40] Magicians they do the same
[1:22:43] thing they
[1:22:45] imitated the first
[1:22:49] sign then Moses
[1:22:51] comes brings the the the second plague
[1:22:55] the
[1:22:57] frogs he says I'm not impressed he calls
[1:23:00] his
[1:23:02] magicians
[1:23:03] produces they
[1:23:05] imitate the second
[1:23:07] sign but wait here comes
[1:23:11] Moses with the third Sign Here Comes
[1:23:15] Moses the third
[1:23:17] Miracle he brings
[1:23:20] life fleed into existence
[1:23:24] you bring sple into
[1:23:26] existence and The Magicians try to do
[1:23:29] it they
[1:23:32] realize that they
[1:23:35] couldn't this
[1:23:37] third they could not imitate
[1:23:40] it I imagine The Magicians
[1:23:44] saying

[1:24:24] they could not imitate the third
[1:24:26] sign and here they come
[1:24:28] worried who's going to tell
[1:24:31] Pharaoh who's going to tell
