peace be still can calm a rolling sea then he can speak peace be still to the storm within that's how much more that he really loves me god bless you all i hope you're god bless you all i hope you're all having a good day today and um i just have a good testimony to share so um some it was november december of last year throughout the whole year i had been suffering with some really bad nervous problems but you know i i am trying to just put that aside you know and so um i think it was around november i had thrown up and there was there was blood and it worried me for a little while and i kind of just tried to put it to the side again i just i didn't want to think dwell too much on it and make it something that it wasn't because sometimes that happened so um as the this year progressed as we started quarantine and you know at the beginning of the year i was having some very bad stomach pains from like right in my top the top of my stomach and i it it actually really hurt and i kind of just tried to ignore it um and then during quarantine it got really bad it was um i thought it was heartburn so i kind of just i tried to eat better or try to eat less so that it doesn't affect my stomach as much and that didn't seem to work the pains they still continued on and um so i just after a while i kind of had enough of keeping it to myself and i went and told my dad and i told him about the pain that i was having and he told me that he had something similar a while back and that it was all stress related and he said that if i continued worrying about things that i had no control over that it could get worse but of course um i'm very grateful for the dad that god has given me and he told me that i just need to place everything in god's hands and so that's that's what i did i prayed and i told god to take control of the situation because because it was really scary because it did hurt it hurt a lot and um but when the pains would come i just tried to fight it off and i tried to claim the blood of jesus on my on my sickness that i had and um so it was last wednesday and i was sitting there and um i was really blessed by the message that um brother the ego brought forth and so i was sitting there and i asked god at the end of his message i just felt my head and i said please don't forget me because i know that there's so many people that are dealing with much worse than stomach ulcers and i just i asked god but please don't forget me because i i can't live like this anymore the pain was really bad especially during the service i got super light-headed and nauseous and i just asked god not to forget about me and so um brother diego at the end of his sermon he began to discern some people some but what they were suffering with he um said someone had back problems and someone was having problems with their feet and when he finished with those i was and i was content and i said lord that's okay um i trust that you have a will for me and i believe that i am healed for jesus but just please don't forget about me and now when i put my head down for the diego said and someone's um suffering with and he paused and my heart dropped i said lord please don't forget about me um he said someone's suffering with a stomach problem and he said it's uh it starts right here and it travels up he said that it's a it's an ulcer it was at that moment that i knew that that was for me and i'm so grateful to god because i know that there are so many people that struggle with so many different things but that you would consider me it really blessed me i just want to thank the lord for the ministry that we have here and i want to thank him for my healing and i pray that this testimony can live the faith of someone god doesn't forget about his children i'm really grateful and i have been doing great i haven't had any stomach problems or anything i have been wonderful so i just want to thank god for everything that he's done for me and for reminding me that i am his child so god bless you all for you have a wonderful day today amen again right there just give one to the lord he sure is good amen what a beautiful specials what a beautiful testimony but it's time to get right into the word of god today with our hearts opened it's a privilege for me to introduce our elder brother abraham perez to todo can we do that amen today just put everything aside lay our hearts upon god's altar [Music] [Music] is [Music] [Music] yes [Music] [Music] is [Music] it [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] are you getting the spirit to hear all these hymns and wow i didn't want you to stop oh man they left this place tommy ready amen amen it is indeed an honor and a privilege you might be at home you might be online but your spirit is here with us amen god is so good oh we got a lengthy message i don't know how far i can go but we'll see how the lord leads us it is the third part of the seventh day with the subtitle the earthquake and to right away let's go to to our scripture revelation 6 12. and i beheld when he had opened the sixth seal and though there was a great earthquake and the sun became black as sac cloth hair and the moon became his blood we'll see right here in the first verse of chapter six we see seven major things number one la primera lugares right away here we see the interruption of nature immediately the interruption unto jesus oh they have no wine oh no nothing and jesus said woman pentecostal church council of churches what have i to do with you que tengo yo que ver contigo mine hour is not yet come me ora so just bring me six water pots the good wine is safe for the end and if you're spiritual you know who brought the good wine at the end of to make the wine that's why nature is groaning calling for a release everything seems out of cater hearts are falling for fears the insanity of humanity it's all waiting and groaning for the day of perfection all creation is struggling for life something was lost when a person gets sick and has aches and pains then you don't cry you do like our pastor said you groan trying to get back to where you were well one was lost we had jurisdiction over all the years of service which could only come in the end time what do we mean that we have the earnest yeah it's the down payment so someone gets sick they have cancer cancer we pray for them and god heals them notice in the beginning or observing the principle the master was cursed and nature filmed because our inheritance is travailing notice here put me on the screen the punctuation i notice all these little things and sister lana if if you're hearing me you used to be one of my top students in english notice the punctuation observing when he opened the sixth hill there was a great earthquake semi-colon in revelation 6 9 an apocalypse the punctuation forgive me a great earthquake semicolon these things were put there for a purpose so this morning let me give you an english lesson a period only ends a sentence it is used before an extended explanation but notice here after the earthquake it has a period over a comma observatory indicating a degree of separation in the condon gravo de separation and it's greater than that marked by a comma yes and it separates units that contain elements except by commas elements so here is the delicate and dangerous part what earthquake open the sixth seal get there's many earthquakes all over the world is becoming thinner and thinner all the time the scientists claim this world este mundo the crust on top of it la cruz around and around until is like the halloween of an egg the earth is nervous she knows she is doomed she expands i remember recording to just uh calm you down we went to awake at a bright bright funeral home and my niece i met her at the door i hadn't seen her in a long time he was pregnant and i says i haven't seen a long time don't [Music] a woman expands expanding she is bulging in in the middle yes so this earth is expanding expanding it is getting shallow at the north pole we are the military unit that has trained the farthest north almost [Music] north pole el pollo norte is getting shallow the waters in its ball in the middle east the oceans are getting deeper hebrews 12 25. oh here we go see that he refused not him that speaketh for if they escaped not who refused him that spake on the earth much more shall not we escape if we turn away from him that speaketh from heaven de los verse 26 verse 26 whose voice then shook the earth but now he has promised saying yet more once more i shake not the earth only but also heaven says jesus and it was uh the biggest earthquake ever recorded in alaska that was the last sign before the gentile world will be louisiana jumped off and went outside from the swimming pool today the single stop it's because the animals have discernment in march of 1964 in march that good friday earthquake in alaska but god was warning by a world tremor what he would soon do on a greater scale everywhere in the world there is an unsettled peace the whole world seems to be shaken can you imagine tommy he said that in 1955 what william what would he say he was mine there was the eye of an eagle looking way into the future i'm not here for that i'm here to show you a way to keep you from being scared not to scare you say matthew matteo i didn't want to bring this bible because it's new and the pages stick but my old one is a bell scarf veteran the pages are falling here we go about the ninth hour jesus cried with a loud voice saying ellie that is to say my god my god why he's not forsaking me some of them that stood there when they heard that said this man called us for elias de los jesus when he had cried again with a loud voice yelled at the and behold the veil of the temple was ran in twain from the top to the bottom and the earth did quake and the rocks and the grays were open and many bodies of the saints which left a rose and came out of the grace after his resurrection and went into the holy city and appeared unto many islands in the end of the sabbath as he began to dawn toward the first day of the week came mary magdalene and the other married to see the sepulchre did he resurrect on the jewish saturday or our sunday give me the screen here we go an interval between two servers you know what i'm talking about when the angel came and took the stone away i just william i just love the words oh and lorena i'm still wearing for my bavero pokemon let's go a little further we got that okay at the end of the sabbath notice the scripture how it reads at the end of the service tord means significance so let me let me tell you right now why do they call it good friday jesus was never on the cross and the friday night it is impossible for him to have been on the cross on the friday i will not let my holy one temple and i'll build it again in three days for three days three nights oh must the solomon be also for three days he died on the cross at three o'clock in the evening and i'm not gonna do all the math you people have homework 200 and you do your homework don't expect me and the festering the minister's and by the time they took him down yeah and by the time they took him to the tomb i am presuming that he was about five o'clock in the evening so you do five o'clock friday five o'clock saturday how many hours twenty-four right right and then from there the first day of the week comes mary magdalene early when it was yet dark it was pointing to it was pointing to dawn towards the first day unto the saponkar and see the stone taken away from the sepulcher notice observing so let's let's add maybe 12 more hours and that's 36 hours burning on sunday so there is no way that he was on the cross on friday he was on the cross either wednesday or thursday it depends if you go to the jewish sabbath or to the gentile sunday little further because their day started six o'clock in the morning saying matthew 28 2. and behold there was a great earthquake for the angel of the lord descended from heaven and came and rolled back the stone from the door and set upon it when did the angel of the lord descend from heaven i've told you so many times from behind this pulpit when did the angel of the lord descend from heaven follow me closely here the first time his voice shook the world the primera is [Music] he was lifted into a constellation of angels in the shape of a pyramid in the form of a pyramid and it formed the face of our lord jesus christ and when the angel came down from heaven he was on the cloud he came down from heaven told him go back to jeffersonville move the stone remove the stones observing the second bible had to remove the stones because they had crucified the word they had crucified it observing in the shape of a pyramid in a form of a pyramid and you hit a crowbar he said observing it was remember i said that this was a physical resurrection hallelujah hallelujah what i'm trying to do this morning like paul told the ephesians to the saints where they are in ephesus i said to the saints there are in las cruces questions he said blessed be the god and father of our lord jesus christ who has blessed us with all spiritual blessings in heavenly places this message is i like good all shouting i want to put your feet up in the those things are put their tummy i'm not telling you something you don't know you're sharp more sharper than me he god that says i looked it looked like a crowbar how come it wasn't a bar of a robin or a bar of a raccoon a crowbar and now he needed us the crows are the ones that are keeping the voice of elijah and when the seventh angel removed the stone and he entered into the king's chamber and when he entered into the king's chamber he received the sword he's received the soul especially the sword of the king this right here to go to the king's chamber [Music] [Applause] there was uh when he removed the stone it was a white stone it was a granite stone look at what is granted it's a grain it's an ingenious stone it's a nature of fire and that granite yes granito that was in the king's chamber it came from mount sinai it came from mount sinai del monte where moses received the law the commandments of this angel yes i was with moses i will be with you he had to receive the law for us observing the sun had never shined on that stone it was in tune but when he opened the six seals was the only coastal city that jesus ever visited if the mighty works had been done on you know 70 years ago and he said there is a crack starting in alaska in alaska through the aleutian islands 200 miles into the sea and it comes back to san diego to los angeles in the beginning we find that satan was so beautiful to his deceived angels and he was the most beautiful angel of all of them sure it lays in the devil [Music] king satan's son thought that god accepted beauty and he thought that bringing in an altar and making it real pretty for worship that's what god would respect they say think the same thing today so if god disrespects worship sincerity sacrifice came with justice just as abel but it was by revelation that he understood that it was not apples and his parentsy did you know the fall came by women at the beginning and fall the end is going to wind up the same way women coming into authority and ruling over man and so forth you know the scripture says that you know the day that she puts on man's clothes and bobs her hair all those things are contrary to god's word you know she represents the church when you watch what women are doing you'll see what the church is doing that's exactly right the old horror and daughters of revelation 17 given to the poor blind miserable people heard doctrine of theology contrary to the word of god and they found there the souls of slaves and men and women of everywhere instead of attracting the people christ vindicates his word which attracts the people you don't attract the people of churches that are attracted by big denominations and big uh doings and great big carry-ons and fancy things but the word of god attracts the bride of christ now notice it's interesting to notice how that that the church tries to attract the attention of the people by buying robes and dress choirs bob there's women and painted faces they think it's a sign like an angel lie like a devil run around all night to dance like say nothing about it and that's what they think is all right that's beautiful but you see that's false made that's not the word of god while the true bride attracts the attention of god by keeping his word now notice now let us notice christ he say when i wait a minute what about this beauty you're talking about the bible said in isaiah 53 2 that when jesus come there was no beauty of him that we should desire is that right there's no beauty if he would have come in the worldly beauty as satan is today the people would have run around him and accept him the way they knew the church today they would have believed him receiving as they do satan today certainly they would but he didn't come in that kind of a beauty but he always comes in the beauty of character the christ wasn't a beautiful great strong stout man god doesn't choose that kind stop just a minute man look at your your creeds that you serve look in your churches is it just exactly with the word of god have you met every qualification say i'm a good man so was nicodemus and so is all the rest they were fine see that don't have nothing to do with it and women i want you to look in the mirror and look what god requires a woman to do and see in god's mirror not your church in god's mirror and see if you could qualify in your life the spiritual bride of jesus christ ministers think the same do you cut corners here to save somebody's feelings over honor would you do this if it wasn't if they put you out of the church if you are feeling that way my dear brother let me warn you in the name of jesus christ flee from that right now and lady if you can't measure up to the qualification of a christian not as a nominal christian but in your heart and your life is patterned exactly like god's marriage certificate here says it has to be and church member if your church isn't like that can measure up to god's qualification of his word [Music] get out of it and get into christ that's solemn warning we don't know what time you don't know what time that this city one day is going to be laying out here at the bottom of this ocean all capernaum said jesus thou who exalted into heaven will be brought down into hell for if the mighty works have been done in sodom and gomorrah it has been standing to this day and solomon gemmar lays in the bottom of the dead sea capernaum to the bottom of the sea thou city who claims to be the city of the angels who's exalted yourself into heaven and sent all the dirty filthy things of fashions and things that even the foreign countries come here to pick up our filth and send it away your fine churches and steeples and so forth the way you do remember one day you will be laying in the bottom of the sea you're a great honeycomb under you right now the wrath of god is bouncing right beneath you how much longer you'll hold this sandbar hanging over that and that ocean i enter a mile deep will slide in there come back to the salton sea [Music] it'll be worse than the last day of pompeii repent los angeles repent the rest of you and turn to god the hour of his wrath is upon the earth flee while there's time to come into [Applause] [Music] christ [Music] [Music] so [Music] [Music] [Music] so [Music] flee to him don't let the devil ever cool you off from this stay right with it until you're everyone filled with the holy ghost in so much that'll make you come to this word that'll make you women straighten up that'll make you man straight up if you say you've got the holy ghost and we'll cope with the word it's another spirit in you spirit is on his word the messiah the anointed word the bride must be a messiah the anointed word [Music] but i tell you with all my heart i've told you the truth i have been shunned to declare to you everything that god has told me to say and i've said it in the name of the lord [Music] it doesn't make believers of people nothing will you know it's exactly thus saith the lord amen amen zechariah 14. and his feet shall stand in that day upon the mount of olives which is before jerusalem on the east and the mount of olives shall cleave in the midst thereof toward the east and toward the west and there shall be a very great valiant and half of the mountain shall move toward the north and half toward the south yes and you shall flee to the valley of the mountains for the valley of the mountain shall reach unto israel yea ye shall flee like as you fled from before the earthquake in the days of uzziah king of judah and the lord my god shall come and know the saints with thee and it shall be in the day that living water shall go out from jerusalem half of them to the former sea and have toward the hindu sea in summer and in winter shall it be aguas here is where we turn the corner to finish we see another earthquake splitting open the earth split in the mount of olives and there were voices and thunders and lightnings and there was a great earthquake such as was not since men were upon the earth so mighty an earthquake and so great entonces and the great city was divided into three parts and the cities of the nations fell and great babylon came in remembrance before god to give unto her the cup of the wine of the furnace of his wrath and every island fled away and the mountains were not found in march in may 11th of this year an earthquake remotely and they send a crown corona virus and it runs east to west in the southern part of the mountain it is the most important cemetery there is that's where all the important people are buried is but on the top of the mount of olives is the most important cemetery in it jerusalem over a hundred and fifty thousand graves there it has been used for over three thousand years millennials who was jesus talking to the aquila jesus he said if you have the faith of a mustard seed and you have faith you can it grows to be the biggest plant in the garden and what is the most important thing of the mustard seed they it makes they extract oil from it they all oil come from the mustard seed sixth seal to open moses so then this master see where did he get his power and he because that donkey was the one that saw that he the donkey was the one that saw the one that was gonna help jesus at the end time well how did that donkey help jesus he recognized had to grow to be a big white horse so he had the power notice that jesus came to the mount of olives but no more than 10 minutes you pesky let me finish okay i gotta finish this because okay notice acts chapter 1 when they therefore were come together they asked of him saying lord will thou at this time restore again the kingdom to israel and he said unto them it is not for you to know the times or the season which the father has put in his own power and we had spoken these things while they beheld he was taken up and a cloud received him out of their sight and while they looked steadfly toward heaven as he went up behold two men stood by them in white apparel who were these two men that saw him ascend it's the two man that will be there when he comes back to the mount of olives garments was also moses and elijah estos because they will be with him on the mount of olives it will be jesus ye man of galilee why stand ye gazed enough into heaven this same jesus which is taken out from you into heaven shall so come in like manner as you have seen him go to heaven [Music] which is from jerusalem a sabbath day's journey it says that living waters was gonna gonna flow there from the city there is no river there in jerusalem what's gonna happen the earthquake will split the and you know but let's take it here on this side mount is is gonna push them to the side from the sea east the dead sea the southern and the desert will blossom like a rosetta he said on the mount of olives they will recognize him in the message he said [Music] if i could gather about one half million around the mount of olives [Music] in an outdoor meeting on the of allied that's the prophet talking okay prophet orlando and tell him to read what it says in the new testament what the messiah was and if he does not repeat the same thing that when he was here then i'm a false prophet observing remember recording there's a lot of there's the cemetery to the south cemetery and the top of mount valles or more than a hundred and fifty thousand graves you know in the kidron valley in esteban in 1964 observant king hussein of jordan was gonna build the intercontinental hotel on top of the mount of alice directly east of the temple mount so they relocated the site to the south and in order to make the hotel they desecrated hundreds hundreds of graves on top of the mount of olives then the arabs came and desecrated the tombs yes that many of the bones and just threw them all over and used the tombs for toilets were buried in burial caves around the mountain full of dead people all over and i'm going to read it only in english to say and i'll finish with this the hand of the lord was now this in the valley the hand of the lord was upon me and carried me out in the spirit of the lord and set me down in the midst of the valley which was full of bones and caused me to pass them round about and because there were very many in the open valley and they were very dry and he said unto me son of man can these bones live and i answered oh lord god thou knowest again he said unto me prophesy from these bones and say unto them oh ye dry bones hear the word of the lord thus says the lord god unto these bones behold i will cause breath to enter into you he had the oil i will call breath to come into you and you shall live and i will lay stinus upon you and will bring up flesh upon you and cover you with skin and put breath in you and you shall live and you shall know that i am the lord mother else says on top of the mouth they recognize who he was hallelujah so i prophesied as i was commanded and as i prophesied there was a noise and behold a shaking in an earthquake and the bones came together bone took his bone and when i beheld all the sinews and the flesh came upon them and the skin covered them above but there was no breath in them then said he unto me prophesy unto the wind prophesy solomon and say to the wind thus says our god come from the four winds of breath and breathe upon this lane that they may live so i prophesied as he commanded me and the breath came into them and they lived and stood up upon their feet an exceeding great army then he said unto me son of man these bones are the whole house of israel behold they say our bones are dry and our hope is lost we are cut off for our parts then the areas cut them in pieces and threw them away therefore prophesy and say unto them thus saith the lord god behold all my people i will open your graves and cause you to come up out of your graves and bring you into the land of israel and you shall know that i am the lord when i have
