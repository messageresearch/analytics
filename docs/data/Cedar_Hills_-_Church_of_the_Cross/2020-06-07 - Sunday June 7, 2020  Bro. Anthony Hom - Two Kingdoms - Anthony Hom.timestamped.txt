[26:14] king behind now you read the tradition
[26:16] if you see problems with politics our
[26:19] problem is completely there is a king
[26:20] behind now you can write that rather
[26:22] isto so just so we know that this is
[26:25] what we're trying to understand most and
[26:28] there is not much but no no matter how
[26:30] complicated through Singapore target and
[26:33] complicado the political and
[26:34] ecclesiastical in the economic
[26:37] situations are no serious political
[26:39] ecclesiasticus the economic us just know
[26:41] that they had their beginning so lost
[26:43] efficacious to Vieira super cheap
[26:45] they're gonna have their end even at
[26:46] their soup in so let's not get
[26:48] interrupted tonight don't know entosis
[26:50] assembles into room pillows don't let
[26:52] these things that are happening in the
[26:53] world move you know the heck is to keep
[26:55] us on El Mundo loss waiver let's learn
[26:57] tonight to move by one thing double some
[26:59] awareness estado chip or lucky and let
[27:01] that be that one thing be God's Word in
[27:03] our life hasta la palabra de Dios de
[27:05] nuestras vidas Christ is the word Cristo
[27:08] so we can learn tonight to just see that
[27:11] simple song on Christ the solid rock I
[27:13] most of it is not you it is akin to
[27:16] crystal a solid abraca all the other
[27:18] Kings are sinking sand all ages is is a
[27:22] dynamo Vidisha
[27:23] the kings of the earth will interrupt
[27:25] you los race is not yet of an interim
[27:27] peers they'll disrupt you it just wanna
[27:29] perturb are they'll take your peace vana
[27:32] catarrhalis to pass but God's Word
[27:34] anchors you tonight pero la palabra use
[27:35] long clothes and no matter what the
[27:37] winds bring is in important ok Trigon
[27:39] lesbian to if you're anchored on Christ
[27:41] the solid rock just rest on clothing
[27:43] crystal La Roca solely that we cannot be
[27:45] moved no podemos there more vidoes so
[27:47] this is really simple tonight it's just
[27:49] simply in esta noche we we heard a
[27:51] couple weeks ago from our pastor couch
[27:53] almost as soon as a man attend mr. pahst
[27:54] well that way when we get out from
[27:56] behind God's Word cuando los alamos that
[27:58] they trust de la palabra it makes you
[27:59] subject to a king of the earth
[28:01] Rochester une soupe de todos los zetas
[28:03] hombre de la tierra
[28:04] you remember when he was describing the
[28:06] tribes shock work on to describe a
[28:08] distribution and the directions in the
[28:11] section is the north a sewer is the UST
[28:14] and how that the king of the north would
[28:15] come in compadre del Norte of Andrea
[28:17] that happens when we get out from behind
[28:19] God a pastor cuando los alamos desde la
[28:22] palabra we do that it makes a subject to
[28:25] one of those kings cuando se Moses Moses
[28:27] a soup Tito's I will notice or radius so
[28:30] let's just dig in a little bit here and
[28:31] see in trauma some polka mas learn where
[28:33] these kings started removed on the end
[28:35] Basara nestorius first of all let's see
[28:38] we went over who Nimrod was America the
[28:42] most Canadian growth he was again he was
[28:44] the son of cush evil couche he was who
[28:47] was the son of ham before ham who was
[28:49] the son of Noah evil annoy we read that
[28:52] Nimrods approach to land
[28:54] vamoose que el el acercamiento Nimrod a
[28:57] tiara
[28:58] if you go
[28:58] back in you read in that chapter that we
[29:00] just read in Genesis you still violated
[29:02] capitalist easily you'll find that that
[29:04] Shem and Japheth
[29:06] vamoose Kissimmee have faith they're up
[29:08] their jurisdiction on the land that they
[29:10] were given Lovegood is extremely la
[29:12] tierra Casillas deal are completely
[29:14] different so complete them into
[29:15] different Shem and Japheth divided the
[29:18] lands amongst their heirs Sami have a
[29:20] DVD arrows to Tierra interrelated arrows
[29:22] but the Bible describes Nimrods portion
[29:25] but is a la Vida at this critical
[29:27] apportioned an inroad as his kingdom
[29:29] let the spirit como su Raymond I want
[29:31] you to keep that characteristic in your
[29:33] mind did okay thing as a characteristic
[29:34] consume and division of Nimrods portion
[29:37] que la división de la poor silk didn't
[29:39] road it's a it it's a kingdom as soon
[29:41] right now there was nobody else but him
[29:44] Navi are not Eva's see no in his
[29:46] approach was they're coming to us
[29:48] ultimate control it il control total he
[29:51] controlled his kingdom l Kodava Ultima
[29:54] meant a total rain I ask you tonight
[29:55] who's controlling your king la pregunta
[29:57] king coat or lazuli no let me warn you
[30:00] they met but fearless if you have
[30:02] yourself in the driver's seat in your
[30:04] kingdom to se tiene incandescent case
[30:07] then lassie I am the control it's
[30:09] already know then you're no different
[30:11] than Nimrod tonight it does so no
[30:13] different they can even growth if in
[30:14] your life you put yourself in the number
[30:16] one place your to veto stead es el que
[30:19] se pone en la ctrl conductor ole ole
[30:21] numero uno in su vida
[30:22] you are no different than Nimrod whose
[30:24] turn was different they can improve so
[30:27] that's it that's one of his
[30:28] characteristics was characteristic us he
[30:31] was a king Aaron Ray he had complete
[30:34] control in the human control total in
[30:36] pseudo mean you next the Bible describes
[30:38] him as a mighty one in the earth
[30:41] mr. loving love the spirit composure
[30:43] roses over la tierra he was known as a
[30:45] mighty hunter before the Lord
[30:47] tarakudo Co como el Grande castle or
[30:49] delante de hvar so we know that he was
[30:51] mighty sorry almost-kiss poderoso how
[30:53] contrary that is to God's waiting and
[30:56] control us to is a la manera de Dios
[30:57] because you because God said that is not
[31:00] by might nor by power the second is poor
[31:02] poor little poor force' but it is by my
[31:04] spirit is what is for me as pity to
[31:06] distil Senor so I want you to keep that
[31:08] in your mind to you're getting an
[31:09] instrumental another characteristic to
[31:11] remember

[36:54] and could Ramos one patron
[36:55] let me tell you tonight because none of
[36:57] those earthly kings will want you to
[36:59] think another way aesthetic appearance
[37:01] and go Terminator but right here in
[37:03] Genesis we find the pattern but a few
[37:05] tendencies in control that all the
[37:07] earthly kingdoms will be established
[37:08] patron por todos ray knows their
[37:10] analysis even I said for Molly it boils
[37:12] down to the fact eva ha estado yeah
[37:15] people would give up their inherent illa
[37:17] history and triggers to Orencia in

[37:35] of protection Kapila for Paquito
[37:37] protection as it's a little
[37:39] uncomfortable tonight maybe the protein
[37:40] como esta noche
[37:42] but this is the pattern you'll see that
[37:44] falls all down to time Mahalo Tim and it
[37:49] starts with
[37:50] getting who you are MPs are could be
[37:53] done to stay here instead down to
[37:54] history a tremendous story I know you'll
[37:57] find that even where God describes that
[37:59] he hates the deeds of the Nicolaitans
[38:01] this went on to do see way a woman's
[38:03] gonna kill all the a loss loss ETSU the
[38:05] loss Nicolaitans why because they
