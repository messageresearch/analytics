[29:37] the Lord for me about it and Here I am
[29:39] up and you know Pentecostals

[29:46] I'd start the music and st. you know and
[29:50] they were real pure body but you know
[29:52] that's the way they are today rowdy man
[29:55] everybody goes their way and Here I am
[29:58] and I'm looking at the door you know
[30:00] saying hey as soon as they can and then
[30:03] you start putting the spirit name
[30:06] this to go wait he said that's this
[30:09] minister up there in the front
[30:12] he knew me real doing in those
[30:14] neighborhoods there yes my dad's - he's
[30:15] still around yeah it's been a little Dom
[30:18] he's never done that and he was real
[30:21] cast back in me yet so much you you
[30:24] would have he would just like persist
[30:25] you know and he kept you know wait he
[30:29] was for science service is he ever said
[30:33] kiss me and you would kind of wave like
[30:35] that day to come forward and I just look
[30:37] away in on it and here are he knew I
[30:42] wasn't going to come forward so he asked
[30:45] another messaging to take over they were
[30:47] looking for the percent of the service
[30:49] and he walked out I say oh my god here
[30:53] he comes oh
[30:55] and I was pretty hostile you know myself
[30:58] aggressive people just don't know no I
[31:03] don't know what no meat so so then he's
[31:06] all I can see is a name and and
[31:09] Here I am waiting again so now I was
[31:12] trying to look through the door yeah the
[31:14] part got just gonna let me go out and
[31:16] act like he was holding
[31:18] guns you know this is White's no come on
[31:23] just you want to come forward and pray
[31:25] so we can thank the Lord and I'm five
[31:27] minutes we could target to tell the
[31:30] closer he gets us but the sound was too
[31:32] much yes it's just just leave me alone
[31:35] I'm fine there right what madness is I
[31:39] see your manner that's just you haven't
[31:42] met because you're insistent and then
[31:45] and then he said you know what Jesus
[31:48] will hear you whether you're happy
[31:50] you're mad
[31:52] upset
[31:53] this doesn't matter I was baptized in
[31:56] the office of the church in the name of
[31:58] the Lord Jesus Christ
[31:59] my dad baptized me for the reset my
[32:02] stance and to receive the gift of the
[32:04] Holy Ghost but when I came in the
[32:06] message
[32:08] it was real
[32:11] so it was really really important
[32:15] that all the highbreed
[32:18] all of us top that was not based on
[32:22] Scripture
[32:23] which was a hybrid seat and the genuine
[32:28] word the original Word of God and then
[32:30] the kinda on the coming to another TV
[32:32] program and all that based on what
[32:34] brother Jimmy was sharing me brother we
[32:38] need to pull up all their high breathe
[32:40] and all the original seats this is what
[32:45] a lot of people in the message
[32:45] understand why I thought we baptize in
[32:48] the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and
[32:51] the message in order to start all over
[32:54] again it's like a baseball diamond
[33:51] when when did you accept them
[33:56] that's about two years
[34:08] and so what keeps you going is a pastor
[34:12] [Music]
[34:19] just in love for the church the people
[34:22] and I remember we started in in
[34:27] [Music]
[34:28] Cuchillo
[34:30] [Music]
[34:34] there was a people there and
[34:38] everywhere we had we had a congregation
[34:42] about body a
[34:45] good congregation a
[34:48] was some desolate church
[34:51] and
[34:54] it was hard to get into the people and
[34:57] get people out and do things III didn't
[35:00] I could do much because I I didn't have
[35:03] the experience or nothing about it I
[35:06] [Music]
[35:07] so it's the love for the people that
[35:10] keeps you going the love of people
[35:13] [Music]
[35:17] yes what is that that keeps you going
[35:21] with this message with the word what is
[35:24] that keeps you strong and it keeps you
[35:26] firm on ground on my door how are you
[35:29] doing this
[35:30] well strong only comes if you're weak
[35:34] without a figure seemed at last three
[35:35] witnesses and I don't feel strong all
[35:38] the time but the verse says that the
[35:41] witness is when you're sincere and you
[35:44] that's when you let him
[35:47] there's a scripture when Peter when the
[35:50] Lord had already said Peter deal of
[35:52] means this particular might achieve fear
[35:55] do you love me of course three times he
[35:58] says it look but I like when he said he
[36:00] said Peter it's after he would be
[36:02] happiest with eutectic love and say take
[36:04] care of mine I call that ego stamina
[36:06] they you know finally he says you know
[36:09] look here when you were young used to go
[36:12] wherever you like private little
[36:14] scriptures they says but when you turn
[36:17] home even a cold wait for somebody
[36:20] that's tasty
[36:22] this he says he said those words big
[36:25] time to tell them that the real death is
[36:28] to die just to yourself but uh
[36:32] there's every point in life versus your
[36:35] buddy the hood says you can't do nothing
[36:37] without me he says come on find love in
[36:40] our daily living I said me not for they
[36:41] says that so the truth is the strength
[36:45] is that you can do nothing only to him
[36:49] and that's the only thing that keeps me
[36:53] going because I don't do things to me or
[36:57] else nothing is no it's a no father is
[36:59] another not absolutely Thomas cannot see
[37:03] me so our strength is it keeps it
[37:09] and
[37:10] what exactly is it that maintains like
[37:14] what is it that maintained relationship
[37:15] with the Lord and with your brothers and
[37:17] sisters in Christ
[37:20] it's
[37:21] the families of those shirts of
[37:24] fellowship utility it's that semi-think
[37:27] Church it restores your vigor
[37:32] spiritually it restores you again it
[37:35] reminds you of the love of Christ would
[37:38] get so involved and other things of
[37:40] doing things as a parent or grandparent
[37:42] and
[37:43] you know the Bible says that as long as
[37:46] we're in this place where did the
[37:47] absence of the Lord we need to get back
[37:49] in there with the spirit in a soul it's
[37:51] and I could think that that fellowship
[37:54] in church is a it's a thing that keeps
[37:57] me going
[37:58] Boetticher Checotah truth no matter how
[38:00] much sometimes his body is gonna fight
[38:02] it all the way and that's my strength
[38:05] it's going to church
[38:09] and learn and Sunday's is the greatest
[38:12] hard life oh yeah
[38:15] learning because we have great teachers
[38:18] you know I wish I had time talk just to
[38:21] go oh man I can share with you stories
[38:23] of scriptures Oh
[38:26] Paul's got my knees and thumbs getting
[38:28] on my knees and back in the old week
[38:31] when they said get concept also this
[38:32] feels a little nice to us they didn't
[38:34] have chairs they were sitting but Hill
[38:36] sits cross-legged seat
[38:38] and we have the greatest teachers right
[38:41] now then we see that their feet I don't
[38:43] mind if they we ever said me not only in
[38:46] a cute if they want to tell me you sit
[38:47] right there I don't doubt I will sit
[38:50] there because those of the beautiful
[38:52] specials this is gues getting generally
[38:55] on behavior that to me we have the
[38:58] greatest teachers right now this way I
[39:00] sleep quiet that's why I want to learn I
[39:03] don't want to jump the gun I don't want
[39:05] to get ahead oh yeah I totally love it
[39:07] you know my love to listen and sometimes
[39:10] when we talk too much we see too many
[39:12] things so it's no I'm targeted without
[39:17] some some crazy reason want to hear this
[39:19] but I went oh it's that's what keeps me
[39:23] going every teachers well maybe Waikiki
[39:27] though me with you know what the Lord is
[39:30] what keeps you what there's times it's
[39:33] hard but I depended on tight coupling
[39:36] because me encouragement and people
[39:39] might
[39:44] [Music]
[39:49] pretty
[40:00] but also in a spiritual way well what
[40:03] advice could you give to us too to
[40:05] maintain our strength me what we have I
[40:09] remember one time when we bought some
[40:11] furniture these this was half negative
[40:15] thought and after Chicano and he was
[40:17] delivering the
[40:20] the salt flats and the furniture from
[40:23] billion flooded every way and ye have
[40:26] really accepted the Lord Jesus Christ
[40:27] and he was really excited and says hey I
[40:29] noticed you have a sign out there and me
[40:31] and monk maybe I will start the Lord you
[40:33] know I said yeah
[40:35] yeah Christian yeah we love the Lord of
[40:39] all hearts you know and he says wow and
[40:41] then he asked me do you guys work for me
[40:44] I said yes how holiday man I was
[40:46] inspired I said and I said you know what
[40:49] and there's a commandment that says the
[40:53] lowly Israel is a mother said what to do
[40:56] Squanto to collect Psalms
[40:58] contour to maintain for talk to sayers
[41:01] but one must further politely is it
[41:05] contentious where's us
[41:07] components forces it to win - you know
[41:09] long with all the strength you know why
[41:13] because I said we went through so many
[41:15] things it's that it's hurtful to change
[41:18] we'll say we didn't go that way such as
[41:21] we turn our strength to sports - to
[41:25] diversions of the world I mean and I
[41:28] made a mistake - you know I was a
[41:30] cross-country runner and I was my
[41:32] strenght that ran marathons and
[41:34] everything I've been going Mexico
[41:36] elliptic spoken there's nothing better
[41:38] what I'm saying is all your strength
[41:40] that's what I say I tell everyone to
[41:43] wait is that something every every bit
[41:47] of it I think turned towards him and you
[41:49] gonna be surprised that he's gonna give
[41:51] you more strength because you're giving
[41:54] and you're gonna receive and that would
[41:56] be my advice because that was the secret
[41:59] to hold on as far as of youth Wow yeah
[42:02] that's what I told that young man is he
[42:05] went out there like saying thank you I
[42:08] said I said and I was surprised because
[42:10] I was not ready for that question but I
[42:12] remember there and I'm saying again this
[42:15] was this how I
[42:18] imagined oh we use your strength over
[42:21] it's a way to tax access
[42:24] exercise how many thumb don't that is
[42:26] wrong that means ground I walked or like
[42:29] an active active no
[42:31] direct
[42:33] that's right Oh every fiber of it you've
[42:37] seen
[42:38] told me everything you got he is not
[42:41] right
[42:43] and what is your advices and or there is
[42:48] a question for you
[42:51] very good dog mmm you have question as
[42:54] the grown-ups or people that come to me
[43:06] what's your favorite song remember
[43:10] of all time what's what's your most
[43:12] favorite song
[43:22] [Music]
[43:28] it's pretty hard to answer that question
[43:30] because I
[43:33] know a lot of I love
[43:36] painted in church today that I've
[43:39] learned
[43:40] such as choruses and things was at the
[43:44] cross one of them at the time
[43:48] every time you preach these to sing that
[43:51] song you never

[46:08] [Music]
[46:20] a
[46:21] [Music]
[46:31] specific one you you you can recommend
[46:33] as possibly is
[46:35] to me was their original the spoken word
[46:39] the original work it was for me by me
[46:43] was here because there are good I
[46:45] understood all the ages I understood my
[46:49] hybrid that was there Daniel 30 church
[46:51] age from the dead yes
[46:55] wispy and back huh all day effect in
[46:58] that night scene 325 how they turn away
[47:01] and when the truth Damien and they think
[47:06] I created the work and how we're gonna
[47:08] get back and I saw that you see it when
[47:11] I saw that what really shocked me well
[47:15] when brother Brandon would see
[47:16] the horn and the dollars little boy oh
[47:20] my god obviously and don't you find
[47:23] yourself in a church that is denying
[47:26] some of the words doc so the reasonable
[47:29] word on 50 I mean I says that all that
[47:32] shook me and I love how they you know I
[47:34] loved it it was it was okay it hurts it
[47:38] hurts to to admit that you were in a
[47:41] church I mean they're beautiful people
[47:44] don't get one but but when it comes to
[47:46] the G no we're not they are designed to
[47:50] some possible data and if they fall in

[55:15] was good Marian and Louie they got
[55:19] married on
[55:21] October the 8th
[55:23] 2006 but I have to go to the to the
[55:28] morning of 2008
[55:31] they had gone to church and
[55:36] then after church the seed got baptized
[55:41] and
[55:43] then went out to eat and it was about
[55:47] three or four o'clock
[55:49] that they got married that same day so I
[55:53] thought it was very special because a
[55:57] little Tommy married them and
[56:01] but I know that they had been dating for
[56:05] a little while and she accepted
[56:11] the message right away so that you know
[56:14] made it easy for Louie you know that she
[56:19] believes the message and believe our
[56:21] profit so that was a good and
[56:26] when did they meet the founding pastor
[56:30] well I was probably the earlier maybe
[56:35] the middle of around June or July of
[56:39] 2006 of course you know my sister passed
[56:43] away in 1996 but she would have been
[56:47] happy to see you know how after they
[56:49] were it's awesome to hear yeah I thought
[56:53] it was pretty neat that they got married
[56:54] that same date because that went to
[56:57] church that that does them they got
[56:59] married
[57:00] that's cool well my brother he's a
[57:04] cowboy and he he loves to raise horses
[57:09] and his donkeys and his pigs and
[57:14] chickens him and Marian do a lot of
[57:18] things together they like to go camping
[57:20] they like to wear rodeos and so they
[57:24] they stay pretty busy and of course
[57:27] they're hunters
[57:31] she was
[57:34] at this year she got a deer and out that
[57:38] my brother didn't get one so we'll have
[57:42] to wait for next year see what happens
[57:44] they like to go hunting
[57:47] awesome yeah
[57:50] anyway
[57:53] they're you know they go to church all
[57:56] the time and and you know these things
[58:00] very happy and
[58:03] of course
[58:05] my Marian and Lou got married she had a
[58:10] special son he has been a blessing to
[58:15] all of us and so Louie has been very
[58:19] very good you know to him and
[58:23] Marianne is just the best mom any child
[58:27] could ask for he got real sick it was a
[58:31] like the end of October and
[58:35] he was in the hospital in and out and
[58:38] finally he she got to take him home and
[58:42] so she had to blame or she didn't work
[58:45] all the month of November nor December
[58:48] you know because her child came first
[58:51] between her job and and Eddie Joey you
[58:55] know she stayed on took care of him and
[58:58] I really admire her because you know
[59:01] being such a good person and good mother
[59:04] so we love her very much and
[59:08] she's you know really been a blessing to
[59:12] our family
[59:12] what would you say is uncle and auntie's
[59:17] greatest strength
[59:18] well the love they have for each other
[59:21] and and
[59:22] you know how the Lord works in their
[59:25] lives and must hook-ups been with Eddie
[59:28] Joe and you know all that you know Rex
[59:30] keeps them together in a very good way
[59:34] what would you say is the key of to life
[59:37] for them it would evolve it would evolve
[59:40] oh I told you about emptyness travel and
[59:44] loving nature and
[59:47] loving each other and loving God that's
[59:51] awesome do you know their favorite hymn
[59:56] you know I really don't I
[59:59] really don't but I do know that they're
[1:00:03] Eddie Joe
[1:00:05] was
[1:00:07] he hasn't been to church with us for a
[1:00:10] while but when he was going to church he
[1:00:12] was
[1:00:14] she was always worshiping he probably
[1:00:18] worship more than any of us and did you
[1:00:21] eat the big last lesson there singing
[1:00:24] and
[1:00:27] he you know just make he doesn't speak
[1:00:31] but he would you know holler out and
[1:00:34] caught his hands and
[1:00:36] and you know if the music makes me very
[1:00:41] happy so I think that is so neat when in
[1:00:45] fact one day he was sitting in the back
[1:00:48] and I don't know how he got up he got up
[1:00:51] and before we knew it he was at the
[1:00:52] altar
[1:00:58] that's amazing
[1:01:01] yeah
[1:01:02] thank you for your time and for
[1:01:07] speaking on their behalf
[1:01:09] and I believe that they will see that
[1:01:15] God bless you I'm here with them
[1:01:19] brother Daniel Danny and
[1:01:22] if so project joy is
[1:01:27] it's an acronym for just older youth and
[1:01:31] so what we're doing is we're doing this
[1:01:35] project to express our gratitude and
[1:01:37] appreciation for the older generation
[1:01:40] that has come before us and and just to
[1:01:46] express our appreciation of your walk
[1:01:50] with the Lord and to document your life
[1:01:52] story so
[1:01:57] the first question is
[1:02:01] how did you come to know the Lord and
[1:02:05] well I got
[1:02:09] converted in December
[1:02:12] 2001
[1:02:14] after my wife died but before then I
[1:02:19] know you know I
[1:02:21] knew the truth in our words but I accept
[1:02:25] the Lord until what happened to my life
[1:02:27] as a I don't know you know if you know
[1:02:30] what happened to my okay so in December
[1:02:34] 2001
[1:02:35] that's when I got converted but you know
[1:02:39] since we were young
[1:02:42] Mei Lan and Tommy still live in Hanover
[1:02:46] in the morning was to go to a Baptist
[1:02:49] Church Sunday School in the night time
[1:02:51] dad used to take us to all the church in
[1:02:54] beard so all that time you know I do
[1:02:56] that Lord but I still am given by my
[1:03:02] heart to love them I was until December
[1:03:04] 2001
[1:03:07] when what when did you get baptized it
[1:03:12] was December 2001 and my brother Tommy's
[1:03:15] I wanted that pliés me over there the
[1:03:18] church in silver
[1:03:21] well um what makes you keep going on cue
[1:03:26] well don't say that gets me going is
[1:03:28] because I know
[1:03:31] my Creator
[1:03:33] and he's my provider he supplies all my
[1:03:37] needs and I know
[1:03:40] that he's live in this earth we're
[1:03:43] living here just watch
[1:03:45] for the Lord gave us 30 years to live in
[1:03:48] this earth so in other words it comes
[1:03:53] down to what do you want spend eternity
[1:03:55] go on vacation or damnation sir for sure
[1:04:00] a lot because I want every choice with
[1:04:03] our Lord now I want to be tormented by
[1:04:05] the devil damnation so I know I know the
[1:04:09] truth since I was young body except the
[1:04:11] Lord until this several 2001 that's
[1:04:15] awesome
[1:04:17] I
[1:04:18] know it's kind of like the same thing
[1:04:20] but
[1:04:22] what what's the what is the key to life
[1:04:27] for you
[1:04:29] the key for life yes
[1:04:32] well the key for lives I would say is
[1:04:37] you gotta give thanks to other for
[1:04:39] everything
[1:04:41] and you got
[1:04:44] thank you for everything getting praise
[1:04:47] honor and glory for her because he's not
[1:04:49] creator I events in there and he's the
[1:04:51] one that's greater created every thing
[1:04:55] that you see was made by key turn every

[1:22:27] concocted forget about the world's
[1:22:30] events and I think first of all for us
[1:22:35] to be able to there's so many details in
[1:22:38] a man of that caliber of our founding
[1:22:42] pastor would take me forever to to give
[1:22:45] it in so many details of his life but
[1:22:48] just a quick overview
[1:22:50] as we we all know of a man that we
[1:22:55] appreciate the greatest man I can say
[1:22:58] that I have that that I've ever had in
[1:23:01] my life
[1:23:01] has been my father my hero my father was
[1:23:06] born in on May 27th 1941 to bedro and
[1:23:11] Maria Pettis he he is there was seven
[1:23:15] brothers him included and six sisters
[1:23:19] and I believe one or two adopted
[1:23:22] and through a through their their that
[1:23:27] the life they were born he was born in
[1:23:30] in Hanover New Mexico a very into a very
[1:23:34] poor family but a family that that loved
[1:23:38] the Lord and and they were raised to to
[1:23:41] serve the Lord
[1:23:42] at the age of I believe it was
[1:23:47] at the at the age of of 18 he ended up
[1:23:52] going into the the US Navy
[1:23:56] there you spent the next four years from
[1:23:59] 1959 to
[1:24:02] 1963
[1:24:03] in the in the Navy
[1:24:06] he when he got out of the Navy I believe
[1:24:09] it was a year later that he married my
[1:24:12] mother which is sister viola Pettis at
[1:24:17] the time her maiden name of course viola
[1:24:19] tell us us and she she was their their
[1:24:24] their first son that they had was in
[1:24:26] nineteen they were married in 1964 in
[1:24:30] the first son came in 1965 and came and
[1:24:34] that was Thomas Jr then came Jacqueline
[1:24:37] in 1966 and
[1:24:40] 1970 was Naomi and then after 1971 was
[1:24:46] Caleb and then 1981 I believe it was
[1:24:50] that was that was William
[1:24:54] but like I said he he was a pastor for
[1:24:59] many many years a great servant of the
[1:25:03] Lord that
[1:25:04] the way that the Lord used him in his
[1:25:07] ministry was simply out of this world as
[1:25:11] we've often said we never had to go look
[1:25:13] for a hero outside of our own home
[1:25:17] so so many things so many miracles so
[1:25:20] many things supernatural things that
[1:25:23] happen during his life
[1:25:25] God's hand always upon him keeping him
[1:25:28] and
[1:25:29] so that's kind of an overview yeah but
[1:25:34] you have any any questions for me yeah
[1:25:37] could you tell us what year he was
[1:25:39] baptized sure so in nineteen in I
[1:25:44] believe it was February 26th of
[1:25:47] 1960 seven that's when he was baptized
[1:25:50] and then and when did he accept the
[1:25:54] message and then well he after being
[1:25:57] baptized in 67 in 1969 him in my uncle
[1:26:01] Abraham they were
[1:26:02] they were were ordained as as ministers
[1:26:07] in Bakersfield California in 1969 I
[1:26:12] believe it was 1972 that they ecstatic
[1:26:17] said that they ended up accepting the
[1:26:18] message
[1:26:21] what was maybe some of his favorite
[1:26:24] messages or you know series of brother
[1:26:26] branham
[1:26:28] well being that he loved the the message
[1:26:31] so much
[1:26:33] every every message he loved he believed
[1:26:38] but he would always tell us especially
[1:26:41] as young ministers that we
[1:26:44] if we could get a hold of the the series
[1:26:48] the church ages the seven churches the
[1:26:52] seven seals the Hebrew series and of
[1:26:56] course Daniels 70 weeks he said if you
[1:26:58] could if you can under get those and and
[1:27:00] and seek the Lord about them and read
[1:27:02] them and you understand that then you'll
[1:27:05] understand the whole message is that
[1:27:07] it's it's all based in there in those in
[1:27:09] those series so those were the things he
[1:27:12] went through so many
[1:27:14] so many church church age and also the
[1:27:17] Seventh Seal books they were like road
[1:27:20] maps so those were probably yeah I would
[1:27:23] say is his favorites what about songs
[1:27:26] what was maybe one of his favorite songs
[1:27:29] well being that he was a musician he he
[1:27:33] loves songs he loves singing he loved
[1:27:36] playing a very avid
[1:27:40] guitarist trumpet ear
[1:27:44] you name it he could pick up any
[1:27:46] instrument and just play it so so I I
[1:27:50] would say that especially during his
[1:27:53] ministry
[1:27:54] one of the songs that he'd love to come
[1:27:56] out with was at the cross also in
[1:28:00] Spanish in la Cruz and
[1:28:02] those that verse were where it says on
[1:28:06] ksfy solo no estoy mondo in console a
[1:28:10] dog that was that was one of his
[1:28:12] favorite songs and one of his favorite
[1:28:15] verses to that song
[1:28:19] okay and the last question I would ask
[1:28:23] um what do you believe it was that kept
[1:28:26] him going for all those years through
[1:28:28] all the trials and things that he
[1:28:29] endured well I believe number one the
[1:28:34] thing that has kept him going and we're
[1:28:37] thankful to God that he's still here
[1:28:39] with us the thing that that kept him
[1:28:41] going was his love for the Lord
[1:28:44] we asked him that question the other day
[1:28:47] and
[1:28:48] to Allah what would keep him going this
[1:28:53] as a pastor and his response was my love
[1:28:57] for the people and if I ever saw a man
[1:29:00] that had a heart and love the people and
[1:29:03] was always wanting to do whatever he
[1:29:05] could to help them make it home
[1:29:07] that's what kept him going many times
[1:29:10] okay well thank you for interviewing
[1:29:14] here today god bless you god bless you
[1:29:21] that might be what he's been talking to
