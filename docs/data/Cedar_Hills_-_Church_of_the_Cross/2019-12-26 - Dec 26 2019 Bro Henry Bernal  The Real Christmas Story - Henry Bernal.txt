Matthew get him of continual agenda anymore leave today San Mateo chapter to happy to Lata's and the first verse that's the primero he reads now when Jesus was born in Bethlehem of Judea in the days of Herod the King behold there came wise men from the east to Jerusalem quando this is assumable and who they Olivia they'd always been you know Lori ntic to Salinas Magus saying where is he that is

hardly ideal or add the blessing torino his word you may be seated Electro's open every plane tomorrow siento I would like to take a different perspective to this Christmas story today gustaría tomar no perspective in test a story NIV that way we know that Christmas is really a corruption of the real purpose of this day they'll bear a propósito is a corrupted story of the greatest event of humanity it's a release to the Quran PL better a mass grand Astoria how many actors we heard on Sunday the guy that the god man come on scootch ammos el Domingo a god man el hombre a nombre de Dios yo some way just hombre coming to manifestation Uganda manifestation and in this process a lot of things have taken place in if they process which is close to the confessional but working in different lives to bring his his world to perfect manifestation used a hundred different areas but i superpose it or not perfect the manifest accion we understand that when Jesus was to be more intrusive a nasara' a lot of things were taking place muchas cosas están siendo we see that John was also in the process to be born famous k1 tambien star and the processor in a ser but he was dead the rest are immortal there was something that was gonna take place there yeah I'll go Kiva acontece energy and and we wait on that yes tournament senator then we we see that at that time that the King Herod even motion is a tiempo clearly a release he uh it was time to raise taxes now it'll tiempo de correr impuestos it's it's a lot of things that start moving that seem to be inconvenient muchas cosas están muy bien dr. policy answering common ent we see that Mary receives the the word of the angel came I receive a la palabra de el ankle and and and she is waiting to have a baby yes that's Baron Dotonbori and and they were respecting that maybe the situation will get better or improved Fernando Collor cos you'll see me hurry well it didn't notice him over no no so you see now how to travel and go out of town or die just think it'd be a hassle you Dennis yeah go to other places you know through Louganis persecution started commensal a persecution many things happening muchas cosas Susi air on so we notice and I want to take the perspective of the scripture which is read 0 to male perspective LS key to wreck a car multi-layer that this Magi cases mangoes they are that were far away it's Tom on lejos and we read the scripture that says that they came asking the molesky to that case vinieron pregnant and where is he born king of Jews don't they start el rey de los ríos cannot see
