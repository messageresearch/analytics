casa de hacer mass mejoras cristianos or company gracias what a shame ok we're went sir there's more to it than that I must insist not sure but how many of us pero cuando nosotros can really take a good hard look at ourselves well most week with adamantane in God's mirror and they'll expect what they do the mirror of God's Word and especial de la pelota de Deus like our pastor told us the other day come on pass the collodion we can look in the mirror where the most veteran el espejo and in the face of our Lord you know Russell signora and say this is that UCS to assess oh how many of us can do that cuantos podemos hacer ESO me many of us look into the mirror which I was almost analyst Peckham what we see you look fmos we see what we want to see care much better we see what we want to see when was located hemos where every seeing somebody see what they want to see I love you Solly Kevin lo que lo que ellos quieren well ya see why ok why do we do that for ksmo sucessful because our consciences are just sprinkled porque no slacking since he has no must cross yellow our consciences are sprinkled as the consensus Rosado but our hearts aren't right but honest us corazones Austin bien we can get baptized we almost have set off asado so you can start down a good road you almost an El Camino correct hear me tonight scooch a minute so near me know what I'm telling you about Jesus the way this chamber the hisui system this is his word that's the super lava we don't take this lightly not a lot to most the most elemental think your conscience bellies kiss ooh concerns here start down a good road empezamos comenzamos El Camino Vienna and because of the washing of the water by the word but a lower mental to the la palabra and the fact that the blood does cleanse us in fact too late the callus on your nose nose limpia we feel like we've done enough no céntimos como hemos hecho suficiente we trick ourselves he assumed trucco para nosotros say something very true but i see that root and unbeaten better than but we say it wrong but a really famous man we say we we think we've done enough he said this mascara see I see most suficiente and we say but by God's grace is unmerited favor you must get the porter grass yes it's a algo and medicine and it's true yes but look I can't do nothing for myself you know personnel poor yo mismo but we say it wrong so many times below schemas mom muchas veces because we say it in a way porque los libros una manera that marginalizes grace okay I say pequeña Paul said shall we continue in sin that grace may abound go to normal self picado kk1 de gracia god forbid he says he cannot but all too often we use God's favor as an excuse but a mucho this is someone's in power they do school - kusa we use this blood as an excuse screw you someone's angry come on let's go sir I have a question for you tonight no but I won't understand what you are you really under the blood you don't mean to start off with a la sangre yep don't have no raise your hands but it has myself tonight but I want to say this about you are you really under the blood we element the stomach with a la sangre knowing that the old testament Servian who kill people to cementum is a type in a shadow of the new testament people swim better than with the cement we know that there are waters of separation oh sorry mascara i was a cephalus young I mean know of the waters the separation month or something unless I was a self honestly there was a perfect sacrifice that was made a v1 second if this was perfect looking for hecho a red heifer una vaca better Mecca and that red heifer was perfect yourself over time and up affect other random calls it a perfect sacrifice a type of Christ and my bromley same perfect with a sacrificial when people that crystal theirs was cedar wood a via Miletus he turned that was the cross cared on a cruise and scarlet he's reluctant type of his blood when people sangria those elements elemental they were burned 20 models and they were putting clean water if the Asus a nice wooden poisonous and I was and that blood yes a Sunday and that body yes sir well plan that cross yes the crews was put in clean water we're putting push this and I would anybody equal get I came into the congregation ever you can mean and throwing like um getting us you had to be sprinkled with these waters of separation encased Rochelle OpenSSL was astir policy oh and it's sprinkled them asean allowed them to come in helos a hurricane iran but the trouble is thrown a pro-level doesn't stop there nobody and many time which others we are comfortable double school go model and we are satisfy some most of the spectrum somebody puts the word together really pull it up a lot of an angle plus the body together face maybe our second official kisser and the preacher comes out and pedagogy honey sprinkles us on Wednesday p.m. Chinese sprinkles us on Sundays and miracles you'll do me are satisfy satisfy our consciences are clear you know trust consensus and him pete williams don't stop there you can be justified costa rica you can be baptized but you can be sanctified santificado but it doesn't stop there nor Obara there is something more like you need necesita is a type there's some people in those waters of separation there's nothing that you have to do for it the waters are blessed and i thank god for that you need to do I believe that Christianity because up to that point it doesn't require you to do any but you have a mental consent there's something else that's needed by Old Testament tells us type the mythology said if you had to take your own sacrifice they get the much who professed you be still you might have gone to water and that sacrifice a sacrifice to those elements were already consumed necessary mental called tomorrow's but there's something else you need take a sacrifice to make a sacrifice yourself you have to say to the priest on the sacrificial and you're confessed just like okay Lord Senor I know I've done wrong you're sick Easter man I know that I've stolen Loyalsock a true I know that I've killed lawyers to get my phone but Lord Jesus I know that that was wrong because was pro se kiss with women and I know that your law requires death yo sir case the later Karen worth it what we do wrong look at someone's mother requires death but get him what that is the penalty the wages of sin is death those Camino say that because his mother and his law requires death EULA later to kill him one thing but this sacrifice for us to sacrifice something that you have to do is that you can spit in it something that you have to know who's Lucas I know there's a pardon for you in a case of a Kaos a sparrow not oh and there's something you have to do to accept the pardon yellow container cassette but up but neither side is up push the pedal you know and you have to put your hands on that sacrifice who stepped any component Manos over in a second if you have to tell the Lord EVC lesson you I'm sorry Lord Jesus autumn Esther you cuz I've done wrong you're a trauma and I know that I'm supposed to die because of this your second get the demo camera por esto but this innocent lamb firstly a snake or the deepest hate in my place it's not a monoamine you are until you know that that innocent lamb can shake what they did understand that the Lord Jesus he took your place the muscle ooh God he took my place ohmy God there's something I've got to do about it okay look at that and I gotta take myself your thumb Christa money I mean with that sacrifice Sukkot feast right my hands on their head watch the priests even a substitution take that knife that little lambs throat equal to and there's gotta be a mess you know yeah you mother it's
