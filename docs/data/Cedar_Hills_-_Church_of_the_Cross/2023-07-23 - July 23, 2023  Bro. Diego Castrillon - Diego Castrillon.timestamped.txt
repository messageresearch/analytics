[37:12] Como
[37:23] I want you to to be comfortable
[37:30] in this time I want you for you to I I
[37:34] want to appreciate our pastor
[37:36] brother Caleb my general for that

[37:43] for giving me this opportunity to be
[37:45] able to direct myself
[37:49] to the precious purchased of the Lord
[37:52] Jesus Christ

[38:02] him
[38:05] that God will bless our brother Lorenzo
[38:09] that he he deserves the best
[38:52] open up your scriptures in Isaiah the
[38:55] 57th chapter
[38:59] and verse 4 15 Isaiah 57 and 15.
[39:05] if you can can you please
[39:09] and we're going to to honor the word of
[39:12] the
[39:14] the scripture says
[39:18] Isaiah 57 15.
[39:23] I want you to notice this verse
[39:28] this verse is in past tense
[39:32] do you say
[39:33] it says
[39:49] he has already said it is in time past
[39:57] that inhabiteth
[39:59] eternity
[40:01] whose name is Holi
[40:07] I want you to notice this next portion
[40:13] I dwell in the high and holy place
[40:21] with him also that is of a contrite and
[40:25] humble Spirit
[40:29] to revive the spirit of the humble
[40:33] and to revive the heart of the contrite
[40:36] once senor
[40:39] emos
[40:41] Lord we have heard your word
[41:08] bless your people in the name of the
[41:10] Lord
[41:13] read it
[41:18] if I would place a title to this message
[41:24] I would would speak it and I would name
[41:27] it humbleness
[41:29] I want to speak on humbleness
[41:36] I believe this theme this title
[41:41] even though we have it we have heard it
[41:46] and we have preached according to it
[41:52] is been very misunderstood
[41:56] because if in reality we would capture
[42:00] we would understand
[42:03] what the Holy Spirit
[42:07] has to teach to his people
[42:12] through the message
[42:15] what humbleness is
[42:18] the rapture would have already happened
[42:23] the great work and the powerful Works
[42:26] would have already been done
[42:39] that's why a Christian always comes to
[42:41] the service
[42:45] to add to him words
[42:55] until the perfect day
[42:58] until you can see
[43:34] it is something that already happened
[43:39] and it will not be moved from what has
[43:42] already been spoken
[43:44] we are speaking about
[43:57] I want you to notice the titles
[44:08] the
[44:11] Lord of hosts
[44:22] he is the one that says
[44:26] psalmist David said
[44:29] that before his presence
[44:32] [Applause]
[44:35] the mountains melt as silk
[44:39] and even the heavens
[44:46] and the heavens
[44:49] they speak about his Justice
[44:53] God yes the almighty one
[44:58] became a man
[45:02] John 1 14 says
[45:10] it came and dwelt with us
[45:20] by him were all things made
[45:23] easy nail and without him
[45:26] nothing that was made
[45:29] would ever have been made
[45:33] we are speaking of one grand great
[45:40] the Bible says that in him
[45:45] and the life was the light of man
[45:50] and that True Light
[45:54] it
[45:55] illuminated men
[45:59] because from his fullness
[46:03] we all drink from gracias Grace upon
[46:09] Grace foreign
[46:29] we're speaking about humbleness
[46:32] brother Branham teaches us
[46:35] Jehovah
[46:39] say foreign Jehovah
[46:51] [Music]
[46:59] foreign
[47:02] he formed himself in humility
[47:05] the almighty God
[47:09] that receives honor and Glory
[47:13] that the Terrapins
[47:15] they cover them
[47:18] they cover their feet
[47:33] he takes away his takes off his crap
[47:38] he takes away all his vests
[47:42] to dress himself
[47:45] and he formed himself in humility
[47:49] not only as men
[47:52] but he became your Redeemer
[47:55] what is his name
[47:58] you know what his name means
[48:58] he is your Redeemer
[49:01] [Applause]
[49:03] Jesus
[49:15] dressed himself with humility
[49:18] Jehovah
[49:21] was formed in humility
[49:24] but now Jesus
[49:28] dresses himself with humility
[49:32] you know you know what that means
[49:36] the children they cannot dress
[49:38] themselves
[50:25] that we have been called by Redemption
[50:45] he dressed himself with humility
[50:51] he had many many choices
[51:02] Kings and majesty and different
[51:04] Christian different vestures
[51:11] he dresses himself with humility
[51:17] and the scripture says
[51:20] because the son of man
[51:24] did not come to be served
[51:26] he came to serve
[51:29] and to give his life
[51:35] that is
[51:46] the humility
[51:49] he dressed himself that way
[51:54] and when he dressed himself
[51:58] he not only dressed himself with
[52:00] humility
[52:01] you know okay
[52:04] but the god that feels all heaven
[52:08] when
[52:09] it came to Earth
[52:13] he took the work that was the lowest
[52:16] that could exist
[52:20] he took a towel and he he wrapped it
[52:24] and he called the disciples and said to
[52:27] them
[52:46] Lord master and
[52:50] listen and you do well
[52:54] because I am
[53:00] the master and the Lord
[53:03] yes have washed your feet
[53:21] we're speaking about humility
[53:28] yours God
[53:30] Zeus Jesus
[53:40] in him dwelt all the fullness of the
[53:43] godhead bottles
[53:49] all of Heaven all of the universe was
[53:53] was emptied into this Tabernacle called
[53:55] Jesus
[53:57] the the flesh was not God
[54:02] but what was inside Jesus
[54:06] what's the fullness of the godhead
[54:09] bodily
[54:12] scripture tells me dead
[54:16] fools Jesus
[54:19] even though you're being God
[54:23] didn't take that
[54:26] he didn't take he did not think it to be
[54:29] robbery
[54:31] to say
[54:34] yes
[54:41] do it this way do it this other way he
[54:46] didn't do it that way
[54:58] that he
[55:00] said
[55:02] that he emptied himself that he took it
[55:05] out of himself
[55:11] and he humbled himself he says and he
[55:15] became obedient because humility as
[55:18] always
[55:19] obedience
[55:21] humility obedience
[55:28] ability has Works humility over us as
[55:32] works
[55:35] Jesus
[55:37] became humble
[55:40] in obedience
[55:43] and obedience unto the death of the
[55:46] Cross
[55:48] and it's the death of the cross
[55:51] this brethren
[55:54] that's this Historia this is history
[55:57] but the scriptures
[55:59] the Apostle Paul foreign
[56:10] [Applause]
[56:34] when we speak of humility
[56:39] oh brother I have humility
[56:43] and we all have uh humility or
[56:46] humbleness
[56:48] we have humility
[56:50] and we we humble ourselves
[56:54] to them against that we know
[56:59] beneficial that we can take out a
[57:02] benefit from
[57:04] the humility
[57:10] you know that you can take advantage
[57:21] foreign
[57:24] I never call the pastor
[58:11] and when we are in problems
[58:15] we call and then we become humble
[58:19] understand me
[58:22] that's the humbleness that we know
[58:26] [Music]
[58:27] the Apostle Paul says wait no wait wait
[58:28] wait a minute
[58:33] sorry the same mind
[58:37] one thing is
[58:42] Jesus said this word
[58:45] that whosoever
[58:48] follow me
[58:50] whosoever
[58:53] who is he speaking to
[58:55] who so ever whosoever
[59:00] is in salsa that that will exalt himself
[59:04] will be a beast broken
[59:48] when the Bible says
[59:52] that Jesus humbled himself unto death
[59:56] it tells me Jesus
[1:00:00] that Jesus lived a broken life
[1:00:07] word broken means
[1:00:14] Brokenness or broken means
[1:00:17] that you humbled in yourself
[1:00:20] and you take your will
[1:00:23] and you place it to the center
[1:00:28] it's on somebody else's words
[1:00:31] Jesus lived a broken life
[1:00:34] he had a right
[1:00:36] have a wife Jesus
[1:00:43] friends to have children
[1:00:49] but he broke his heart
[1:00:53] for not to do his words
[1:00:57] but the will of him that had sent him
[1:01:04] that is Brokenness
[1:01:07] God had already spoken
