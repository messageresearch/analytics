[6:50] would like to tell you of some native
[6:53] Indian people that were down here at the
[6:56] coast of on British Columbia on Van cver
[7:00] Island there was
[7:03] a the chief of ulet tribe his name was
[7:07] Jack Patrick he was a Christian I lived
[7:11] in his house when I would go up there
[7:14] for meetings and his
[7:17] wife and his uncle who became a very
[7:21] dear friend of mine Albert Jackson and
[7:25] his wife the four of them had brought a
[7:30] a sister up once
[7:32] again
[7:34] this event actually spans many years but
[7:39] yet the actual event which I'm relating
[7:43] happened in these
[7:45] meetings and they came up for the
[7:48] meetings because I had spoken of
[7:51] arranging these meetings in Grand
[7:53] Prairie and Dawson Creek so they drove
[7:56] the 800 miles up to Dawson
[8:00] Creek
[8:02] and then found out that the first
[8:04] meetings were in Grand Prairie they
[8:06] almost came
[8:09] back which would have been a great
[8:11] disappointment to me they had a woman
[8:14] with them that was dying with cancer and
[8:18] she had a terrible issue of blood I I
[8:22] don't know much about it except I was to
[8:25] find
[8:26] out and in the years that followed
[8:30] and uh brother Brenham called her
[8:34] out and told her to stand she wasn't
[8:38] strong enough to
[8:39] stand and he called her out and said
[8:42] that she would be healed or whatever
[8:44] more I don't know to have faith and the
[8:47] native Indian people had a very simple
[8:49] faith and they were staying in a motel
[8:52] they told me that that night they were
[8:57] in the motel and in the middle of the
[8:59] night at some time she became violently
[9:03] ill I think sister Albert Jackson went
[9:06] with her to the washroom and she passed
[9:09] a large
[9:13] cancer many years later now this is the
[9:17] other aspect many years
[9:21] later we had moved to
[9:23] Toronto were in Toronto for several
[9:27] years moved back here here to
[9:30] Sur and now had the meetings and a
[9:33] church
[9:34] here a woman a native Indian woman from
[9:38] Port El Bernie who was in the
[9:41] meetings her name is Agnes
[9:44] dick she came
[9:47] over to our church here in Su and was
[9:50] here in the house we had meetings in the
[9:53] house and she was in the meetings in the
[9:56] house just once in all the years we've
[9:59] been here she was just there once and
[10:03] this was many years after
[10:06] 1961 it probably was at least
[10:10] 1972 73 so 10 11 12 years later she was
[10:17] came to
[10:18] Vancouver because she was in the medical
[10:21] field and nursing or something and she
[10:24] took a special course there and came out
[10:26] here and saw us just once
[10:30] and that's why I like to be able to
[10:34] convey to
[10:35] you I was
[10:37] there I was in the
[10:40] meetings I had arranged the
[10:43] meetings I knew the people Chief Jack
[10:46] Patrick his wife Albert Jackson his wife
[10:50] and now Sister Agnes dick comes over and
[10:54] spends one service with us and after the
[10:58] service I was telling her about this she
[11:00] said they stopped at my
[11:03] home on the way up and she said they
[11:07] spent the
[11:09] night and she said the woman was
[11:14] issuing blood and so on so badly it
[11:18] soaked through she said I had to put
[11:20] sheets under her and it soaked through
[11:23] into the
[11:24] mattress and I told them do not take her
[11:30] she will not make the journey she will
[11:34] not be a she will not live for that
[11:37] Journey that long journey to Dawson
[11:40] Creek and Fort and Grand
[11:43] Prairie and she said she was she got
[11:47] healed and she's still living today and
[11:51] that was many years later 10 12 15 years
[11:54] later and she's still living
[11:57] today I think that I should say
[11:59] say
[12:01] something was something registered in
[12:05] the hearts of the native
[12:07] people sister Agnes dick when I had been
[12:11] when I had been there living there on
[12:14] Vancouver Island which was some years
[12:17] before this woman was
[12:21] healed and I had a unique experience
[12:24] with this Albert Jackson he was a very
[12:28] very
[12:29] very elderly
[12:32] man and had a real scowly looking face
[12:36] just like a great
[12:38] storm and I I thought that he was angry
[12:41] with me first time I met him I thought
[12:44] he was very angry with me I preached but
[12:48] now a short time later here we are
[12:51] having a meeting in Port El Bernie which
[12:54] is probably 50 60 miles from UK cluet
[13:01] and he came to me because we had this
[13:04] very close
[13:05] connection he could not speak English
[13:08] well so he said to me he said I was to
[13:12] preach in the long house and there was
[13:15] about 300 people
[13:17] there and so he Albert Jackson said uh
[13:22] fo you a you that's before
[13:25] you a fo you speak I speak
[13:30] I said okay brother Albert before I
[13:33] speak you want to
[13:37] speak before you I speak okay I said
[13:42] that's fine so before I got up and spoke
[13:45] and I remember what I spoke on I spoke
[13:48] on the midnight
[13:50] hour and the workers and the laborers
[13:53] that were called at the different times
[13:57] and I said it's very very late
[13:59] [Music]
[14:01] and he got up and spoke in his native
[14:04] tongue all I noticed was all the
[14:07] children were lined up on little
[14:10] bench with on blocks of
[14:12] wood and they were just sitting he they
[14:16] were transfixed with him as he spoke in
[14:19] his native tongue this sister Agnes
[14:22] dick that I just talked about got up
[14:27] after and she came to the front and she
[14:30] said I don't think I could ever be the
[14:33] same
[14:33] again she said I know that brother Bisal
[14:37] doesn't know anything of our
[14:39] language and I know that Albert Jackson
[14:43] doesn't know anything of
[14:45] English and he gets up and speaks to us
[14:49] in our native
[14:51] tongue and brother Bisal gets up and
[14:54] speaks in English and they both said
[14:57] almost the same thing word for word
[14:59] word and she said I can never be the
[15:02] same so there were Supernatural things
[15:05] that were happening at that time but
[15:09] here maybe 20 30 years later is a
[15:15] network and a woman is healed from
[15:19] cancer and then they are affected by our
[15:24] lives and our ministry and when it comes
[15:27] down to Sister Agnes dick passing her
[15:30] husband calls he's 82 years old then has
[15:34] his grandchildren called brother Eddie
[15:37] bisco many years and I go back to Port
[15:40] El Bernie and there so we have
[15:44] a a very very unique
[15:48] connection and all I can say is they're
[15:51] caught in uh in a web of Supernatural
[15:55] things that were happening so I would
[15:57] like to say the supernatural God that
[16:01] was calling the woman to stand the
[16:04] supernatural God that healed her from
[16:07] cancer the supernatural God that kept
[16:10] her alive for many years and then to
[16:13] have the same Supernatural God call us
[16:17] to come over and give testimony and to
[16:22] speak and to sing and to give testimony
[16:27] once again so that they would know the
[16:31] God that was demonstrating himself on
[16:34] the platform was the same God

[16:48] [Music]
[16:59] h
[17:03] [Music]
[18:02] [Music]
[18:16] we lived in
[18:18] Victoria and uh I got a call from my
[18:24] brother saying that my dad had had uh a
[18:28] massive heart attack the main artery of
[18:31] to his heart had ruptured out and he was
[18:35] just hanging on a
[18:37] thread and uh in those days they had
[18:40] oxygen tents where they put them over
[18:43] you so my husband called the doctor in
[18:47] Dawson Creek and the doctor said you'd
[18:49] better send her up so it was about a
[18:54] 2hour flight I guess up to Dawson so I
[18:57] went up and and I was only able to stand
[19:00] by his bed for 10
[19:03] minutes and a day and not not speak to
[19:07] him he couldn't speak of
[19:09] course and I was there for 2 or 3 days
[19:12] and then I had to come back because we
[19:14] were now preparing for brother bram's
[19:17] meetings I was very burdened for him my
[19:21] heart was very heavy and we went into
[19:25] the alurn
[19:26] meetings with that on my heart wanting
[19:30] to speak to brother brandham and ask him
[19:33] to pray for him but I didn't have a
[19:35] chance because I was playing the
[19:38] piano and then we came down to Victoria
[19:41] and had the meetings
[19:43] there and the meetings closed and
[19:46] brother Ed was speaking to brother
[19:49] brandham and just saying goodbye to him
[19:52] and we stood outside the
[19:54] motel and it was evening late evening
[19:58] and they were just saying goodbye in a
[19:59] very casual way and then he just turned
[20:02] and said oh by the way sister piscal
[20:06] your father will be all
[20:08] right and from then on he
[20:13] recovered and I think he was about
[20:17] 64 when he had that
[20:21] attack and from then on he had no
[20:24] trouble with his heart not one minute
[20:28] and he lived just a month from
[20:31] 85 and he passed away just from old age
[20:36] no trouble with his heart
[20:39] whatsoever and when brother Bram said
[20:42] he'll be all right he was all
[20:45] right and he he confessed he said I know
[20:48] I'm
[20:50] saved in Al Bernie I was in the meetings
[20:54] there when brother Brown was there and
[20:57] hearing him call out the native Indian
[21:00] people that I knew and I knew their
[21:04] situations I don't know if he told about
[21:07] this one uh brother his name was Mike
[21:11] and he was sitting right up probably the
[21:13] second row from the front and everybody
[21:17] knew about an older man who was from a
[21:21] little fishing Village called a houset
[21:25] he had been an invalid just laying on
[21:28] the C for
[21:30] years and uh and brother bradam said to
[21:35] this brother Mike you're praying for
[21:39] this man and he's an invalid and he's in
[21:43] a
[21:44] hospital not far from here in a city
[21:48] called
[21:50] Nimo well brother Ed knew that this
[21:54] brother was from
[21:56] AET so in his his mind he said no this
[22:00] brother is not in a Nimo he's in a
[22:04] houset and another brother on the
[22:06] platform said no this brother is not in
[22:12] Nimo he's in alurn in a
[22:15] hospital and afterwards they found out
[22:18] yes he had been
[22:20] moved that very day up to the Indian
[22:24] Hospital in Nimo and brother Bram had
[22:28] said he's in the nimu
[22:32] brother Robert
[22:34] Johnson um took brother branam out in
[22:37] his boat this is in the alurn area and
[22:42] it was out on the alurn
[22:45] canal and uh brother Johnson and his
[22:48] wife were unable to have children and
[22:52] they had prayed about having a child and
[22:55] uh as they were going along in the boat
[23:00] uh suddenly they thought they had hit a
[23:04] log what they call a dead head it's a
[23:07] floating log just below the surface very
[23:11] dangerous to to boats if they hit that
[23:15] and and uh brother brandham said to
[23:19] brother Johnson you
[23:21] thought you thought you hit a dead head
[23:25] that was the presence of the Lord
[23:27] letting you know that he's going to give
[23:30] you and your wife a
[23:32] child we lived with the native people
[23:36] that ulet we stayed in their
[23:39] house I wouldn't even want to tell you
[23:42] the conditions of things that we saw but
[23:47] you know that's the way it
[23:48] is you know when you when you don't want

[26:16] so yeah it's good
[26:21] [Music]
[27:21] [Applause]
[27:22] [Music]
[28:00] coming home the other night or the other
[28:02] day or just before I come home I was
[28:05] fell into a vision and I seen some
[28:08] little fellas thin look like young boys
[28:11] or something had on caps and we were
[28:13] standing hunting and I'd shot a mammoth
[28:17] big brown looking bear and then they
[28:19] turned around and said to me said um but
[28:22] there's some confusion about the meeting
[28:24] and I said no matter what the confusion
[28:26] is if I supposed to go wherever it was
[28:28] I'll go anyhow see it doesn't matter in
[28:31] the vision stop I don't know where
[28:33] that's at but this is on tape it's going
[28:35] to happen just remember it's going to
[28:37] happen it's a vision on one of the
[28:41] trips uh we had just arrived and made
[28:44] camp and
[28:48] uh brother brother Southwick said Blain
[28:52] why don't you and Billy Paul and brother
[28:55] Ed uh go this Direction and I and
[29:00] brother Brandon will we'll we'll go up
[29:02] the mountain just behind us here and I
[29:05] think that he wanted to do that because
[29:07] on the first day of the hunt he wanted
[29:10] to um be take brother brand a little bit
[29:14] easier and he wanted it a little easier
[29:16] for himself as well because he had you
[29:19] know suffered a wee bit with
[29:21] angina so they were going to take it
[29:24] easier and we made our
[29:26] way uh
[29:28] down the valley and then up into another
[29:32] Little Valley and we just climbed up on
[29:35] a bench and there was a giant bear
[29:39] coming down the other side of this
[29:42] Valley not far from us and he was making
[29:45] his way and we kind of positioned
[29:47] ourselves behind some
[29:49] Willows I never saw a bear like this
[29:52] before or
[29:54] since and he was quite dark very large
[30:00] and right from behind his
[30:02] ears and over over his hump and down his
[30:07] down his cape down his breast like so he
[30:10] was just the color of golden wheat I
[30:14] never saw a bear like that it was the
[30:16] most magnificent thing and large and he
[30:20] was turning over stones and looking for
[30:23] ants and things and maybe rodents and so
[30:26] on and he was making his way L down and
[30:29] and I know that Grizzlies
[30:31] are very poor sighted but they're
[30:36] hearing and and especially their smell
[30:39] is so accurate we don't know that world
[30:44] at all but God has given them
[30:46] that and he when he walked out to the
[30:50] where the hills turned into this Valley
[30:55] and he just across from us and Billy
[30:58] Paul and brother Blaine and myself we
[31:02] got down in the Willows there was just
[31:04] small Willows there and we were watching
[31:07] this bear and he came down and he was
[31:09] across from us he was probably four five
[31:13] 600 yards across the mouth of this
[31:16] little Valley it was started like a wash
[31:20] from a
[31:21] basin and uh we were watching
[31:25] him and uh the other brother Brothers
[31:28] thought I should try a shot at it and I
[31:30] said no I wouldn't do that I said
[31:33] brother Brenham hasn't fired a shot yet
[31:36] that I know of I said I I wouldn't want
[31:38] to do that we didn't know it had not
[31:43] connected it with the a vision brother
[31:46] Bram had had of a large big brown bear
[31:51] and this was him and we watched him for
[31:54] probably half an hour and then I saw
[31:58] that bear and he just put that giant
[32:00] head up into the air and the wind and he
[32:05] uh he was he tossed his head back and
[32:08] forth and he was trying to get our scent
[32:12] and then he just went like this and
[32:15] looked straight across the valley at
[32:18] us and then he wheeled around and
[32:22] started on a gallop and he ran straight
[32:25] up this mountain I timed him it was
[32:28] probably 10 12 minutes and he went right
[32:31] right over the top of this mountain up
[32:34] into the glacier and his big paws and we
[32:37] were watching in the glasses and he ran
[32:40] right over the top of this mountain and
[32:45] disappeared that
[32:47] day brother Billy Paul had gotten a
[32:51] caribou and I also got a caribou later
[32:54] in the afternoon and the next day was
[32:58] just a cloudy Stormy Weather and it
[33:03] rained and it was cold and that night
[33:07] and the next day and the next day and
[33:10] the next day 4 days we were locked into
[33:14] the
[33:16] tent and I heard brother Southwick he
[33:20] kind of came by because I
[33:22] was kind of the point man and arranged
[33:25] the Hunts and bought the food and got
[33:29] things you know organized for the hunt
[33:32] and uh so he kind of he just came by me
[33:37] he said I think brother Brenham wants to
[33:39] go
[33:40] home oh I said you know that was a shock
[33:44] to me I couldn't believe that he wanted
[33:46] to go home we hadn't really started the
[33:49] hunt in Earnest so I said to brother
[33:52] brandham I I said brother brandham do
[33:55] you do you want to go
[33:56] home oh he said we've had a wonderful
[33:59] hunt I said but you haven't even fired a
[34:02] shot he said well that means I can come
[34:05] back next year and uh he took it so
[34:08] nicely and and I felt I felt kind of
[34:14] downhearted that to me it hadn't been
[34:18] completed and uh it was raining and
[34:22] cloudy and the clouds were hanging low
[34:26] and it was cold and it was just very
[34:29] miserable weather so Bud started to pack
[34:32] up things and make ready to go and it
[34:36] was uh I was feeling quite
[34:39] downcast and we had the horses outside
[34:42] and now starting to put the panyards on
[34:45] them and this is quite a lengthy process
[34:50] probably take 2 and 1 half three hours
[34:53] and uh I was outside with my horse and
[34:56] brother Brenham
[34:58] he came up and he said brother Eddie
[35:00] where was it that you saw that
[35:03] bear and I said well I pointed down the
[35:06] valley I said it's right down here and
[35:10] where those that little uh Valley comes
[35:14] in to this one I said you just turn left
[35:18] and he go right up in there and he was
[35:19] right on the
[35:21] bench of the
[35:23] mountain and he said uh how long how
[35:27] long are we going to be so we asked bud
[35:30] how long are we going to be oh he said
[35:32] you have lots of time you just take your
[35:35] time and go and and uh you know you've
[35:38] got a lot of time probably a couple of
[35:40] hours yet so brother Brenham just
[35:42] disappeared in the little short Willows
[35:45] and he was gone
[35:47] and and brother Bud carried on and I was
[35:52] standing with my horse and we were in
[35:54] our rain gear and this was really
[35:59] remarkable and then finally I got on my
[36:02] horse and I was sitting on my horse and
[36:06] brother brandham about an hour and a
[36:08] half or two hours later he came out he
[36:12] he'd been out he' actually been alone
[36:15] with God I believe and he came out and
[36:18] he
[36:19] uh came up right beside my
[36:22] horse and this is what happened to
[36:26] me this this is what I heard and this is
[36:30] my
[36:31] testimony and he said put his finger up
[36:35] he said this is on account of
[36:39] me he he said and some people might be
[36:43] offended with this but this is what he
[36:45] said I'm the Jonah in this group he said
[36:49] I knew I should have been with you
[36:50] little fellows he said it's the only
[36:53] time I know that I've disobeyed a vision
[36:56] only twice
[36:58] only twice that I've known I've
[37:00] disobeyed a vision and he said uh like
[37:04] this was the second
[37:05] time and he
[37:07] said uh but he said this is
[37:11] over and we'll right out of here dry
[37:16] dry the leaves on the bushes were just
[37:20] Laden with rain and wet and if you just
[37:24] went a a few meters few yards into the
[37:29] woods because there were short Willows
[37:33] but if you would just go a few yards
[37:36] you'd be soaking
[37:37] wet and I was just I was bewildered I
[37:40] didn't know what to say I didn't know
[37:42] how to
[37:43] respond and I just sat
[37:46] there and I was sitting there about
[37:49] maybe 10 minutes and
[37:51] pondering the words that I've just
[37:55] heard but we'll drive we'll ride out of
[37:58] here
[37:59] dry it's over he said it's over and
[38:04] we'll ride out of here
[38:06] dry so all I knew is that
[38:11] whatever uh disappointment there was or
[38:15] he'd settled something with God or
[38:18] whatever I wasn't questioning I didn't
[38:21] try to figure things out I just knew it
[38:25] was over and in about 10 minutes not
[38:30] more than 10 12 15 minutes at the most
[38:34] there was a puff of air warm air that
[38:39] just kind of blew
[38:41] by by me and I thought boy that was nice
[38:46] that was nice warm air and I we hadn't
[38:50] felt that for a number of days and just
[38:53] a little puff of air and then
[38:58] little while later there was a little
[39:00] breeze and the leaves were
[39:04] shaking and I noticed a probably 20 30
[39:09] yards or meters in front of me a sun the
[39:13] Sun was shining just a big round spot
[39:16] where the Sun was shining thought well I
[39:20] I looked up there was a hole in the sky
[39:23] and I was looking at Blue Sky and the
[39:27] Sun was shining straight through there
[39:29] on the ground and a little warm breeze
[39:32] was just like a Hawaiian Breeze was
[39:36] blowing just a lovely little breeze and
[39:41] the leaves were shaking and and before
[39:44] our horses took the first
[39:47] step it was hot sunshine I took off the
[39:52] rain gear that I had on and we rode out
[39:55] of there in our shirt sleeves
[39:58] and it was very warm weather and we rode
[40:02] all the way home about 8 hours in the
[40:06] perfect
[40:07] sunshine and just a lovely day you
[40:11] couldn't have had a more picture perfect
[40:13] day than that day and we just rode out
[40:16] dry I want to say to the
[40:19] viewers if we' rode out wet you wouldn't
[40:22] be hearing this
[40:24] testimony we rode out dry
[40:27] that's what he said and that's exactly
[40:30] what happened and I want to give all the
[40:34] glory to our Lord Jesus Christ the
[40:37] people and many people don't understand
[40:42] some don't think well it's not fulfilled
[40:44] Etc I would like to I have a couple of
[40:48] slides here that we'd like to refer to
[40:52] and I'd like to quote
[40:58] this is in September
[41:00] 1962 after the
[41:03] hunt and it's in the message
[41:05] countdown brother brandham says so I in
[41:08] these 30 going on 32 years of ministry I
[41:13] have tried to stay true to I don't know
[41:15] one thing I've ever had to Al on because
[41:18] I just read it out of the Bible said
[41:20] just what the Bible say and let it go
[41:22] like that and so I haven't had to take
[41:24] back or rearrange because I just said it
[41:27] the way that the Bible says it and I
[41:30] find out if God has spoken anything then
[41:34] we must go with that word in order to
[41:39] make it be fulfilled amen amen we've
[41:41] seen that as I told you last night of a
[41:43] vision just recently see that I had to
[41:47] be there and warning to be there and
[41:49] telling me 6 months before to be on that
[41:52] spot and standing there and saying go
[41:54] down there three times with them and I
[41:56] just walk on the other man and the
[41:58] vision passed right through exactly
[42:00] God's part I was left standing so we
[42:03] want to remember you've got to stay on
[42:05] the word stay right with the word where
[42:07] the word leads you go right with the
[42:08] word and you'll bring you out all right
[42:11] bring you out all right I'm sure and
[42:16] that that for my part is the absolute
[42:20] solution and to the
[42:23] vision uh I I'm just sorry that a lot of
[42:29] people either don't ask their pastors or
[42:33] they don't research it in the message
[42:36] and then some just speak presumptuously
[42:39] that's without authority of any kind
[42:42] they don't have any Supernatural
[42:43] Authority they don't have the attendance
[42:46] of the Angel of the Lord and they go and
[42:49] say that brother brandham spoke
[42:52] presumptuously well I can I can
[42:55] declare he did not he spoke with great
[42:58] Authority and great clarity and
[43:01] furthermore I was right there it never
[43:04] belittled or diminished him when he said
[43:07] this is on account of me it never
[43:09] occurred to me that that it made less of
[43:12] him I always thought it was great it was
[43:16] greater that he could actually say it
[43:19] this is on account of me I mean I didn't
[43:23] want to be selfish but the fact that we
[43:26] wrote out dry and the weather changed I
[43:30] thought what kind of man is this you
[43:33] know that speaks to the wind and the
[43:35] waves and speaks to the storm and the
[43:38] clouds and what is this what's God doing
[43:41] for me you know I always thought that it
[43:45] was just
[43:47] beyond uh beyond what was almost
[43:51] necessary you know that we that we that
[43:55] I I I would be privileged to experience
[43:59] that and here I it it baffled me that
[44:02] people would find that as a reason to
[44:05] disbelieve I thought what a world is
[44:10] going through their minds I just I can't
[44:13] even understand it today I just can't
[44:16] understand it he just lived lived it
[44:20] lived the full life of the Lord Jesus
[44:24] Christ uh whether it was whether it was
[44:27] in honor or whether he was admitting
[44:31] that he wasn't standing where he should
[44:33] be as he said in the message and he told
[44:36] it right publicly to the people and you
[44:39] have to be standing where you standing
[44:42] with the word if it's to be fulfilled
[44:45] and then it'll be all right
[44:51] [Music]
[46:12] [Music]
[46:27] we were driving in his vehicle he was
[46:30] driving I was sitting in the passenger
[46:33] side and Blaine Southwick was in the
[46:36] back seat I don't know what Blaine was
[46:38] doing at this moment but brother
[46:41] brandham
[46:43] was just
[46:46] driving and it was a gravel Alaska
[46:49] Highway was still gravel
[46:51] there and he said he tilted his head
[46:54] back a little bit and he said
[46:57] brother Eddie what do you think of this
[47:01] ministry do you think it could be that
[47:03] of Elijah the prophet as it's foretold
[47:06] in the scripture and then he mentioned
[47:09] several time several places and then he
[47:12] said into Revelation and then his voice
[47:15] just trailed
[47:16] off well I want to stop
[47:20] there brother bram's voice when he
[47:24] was I would say deep under anointing in
[47:28] the deep in a
[47:30] vision he's actually in another
[47:34] world and he would say uh-huh
[47:37] uh-huh you notice when he was when he is
[47:41] has people before him and he starts
[47:44] telling them in detail about their lives
[47:49] and about why they're there and you're
[47:51] praying for someone and he was in the
[47:53] war and you have a letter from your
[47:56] daughter and in your purse and uhhuh
[47:59] uhuh and his voice would just get what I
[48:02] call
[48:04] thick kind of deep and thick and trails
[48:07] off and sometimes not very clear in what
[48:11] he's
[48:12] saying not too hard not too easy to hear
[48:16] well that's how the voice went and so I
[48:19] knew that he was just
[48:21] under uh in a deep somewhere in a deep
[48:26] vision
[48:27] said what do you think of this ministry
[48:29] he did not say my Ministry he said this
[48:33] ministry you think it could be that of
[48:36] Elijah the prophet as it's foretold in
[48:38] the scriptures in the Revelation and so
[48:40] on and then he just trailed
[48:44] off I said
[48:46] well for I felt very
[48:49] inadequate to answer that kind of a
[48:52] question I didn't feel spiritually
[48:55] adequate in
[48:57] I didn't feel as though I was adequate
[49:01] to answer that question and I looked
[49:03] down at the glove
[49:05] box and I said well for all I know
[49:08] brother brandom it must be it has every
[49:12] appearance of being and at and and then
[49:15] he said I kind of think so
[49:18] myself and at that
[49:21] instant with a complete Union of what
[49:24] our agreement in agreement at that
[49:26] instant all I can tell you is that it
[49:29] was a
[49:30] person I believe the angel of the Lord
[49:35] just between us and slightly forward not
[49:39] right here but just slightly forward the
[49:43] presence of a
[49:45] person and I literally I froze I thought
[49:49] I was going to die I thought I was going
[49:51] to pass into some other place I didn't
[49:55] know anything about and I was just
[49:57] staring at the box and I was afraid to
[50:00] move and the presence was so
[50:06] holy the presence was
[50:09] so all
[50:11] consuming you just could not not that
[50:15] you wanted to escape it but it was
[50:19] just
[50:20] um just
[50:23] all complete complete presence gripping
[50:27] you and I just stared at the
[50:30] box and I I looked up I only knew one
[50:33] thing to do and that is to see how
[50:36] brother brandom is reacting to this and
[50:39] I just looked I cast my eyes kind of
[50:42] sideways to look at
[50:44] him we had about 4 days beard on three 4
[50:49] days beard I would say we we we we had
[50:53] been out in the
[50:55] bush and his beard was sticking out
[50:58] prickling like very
[51:01] prickly and and his face was
[51:05] pale and I thought he looks like a
[51:09] person near death I'd only seen it once
[51:12] before in my
[51:14] life and I'd been with a very good
[51:16] friend of mine I just came to his house
[51:19] I just pulled in and he had been pinned
[51:22] between two heavy pieces of equipment
[51:24] with his
[51:25] temples and had truck and a loader
[51:28] behind it and he was pinned between the
[51:30] two and he used all of his
[51:33] strength probably a supernatural
[51:36] strength at that moment and just to
[51:38] press the push the two pieces of
[51:42] equipment apart in that
[51:43] freedom and when I happened to drive in
[51:48] they had him laid out on his
[51:50] sofa and I noticed that his beard from
[51:53] the shock to the system his beard had
[51:57] prickled out and he was just pale and
[52:00] that whole image just flashed through my
[52:04] mind in an instant when I looked at
[52:06] brother Brenham and that I just thought
[52:09] that and brother Brenham kind of rolled
[52:12] his head back looked over to
[52:15] me he said I guess he's come to me
[52:18] brother Eddie 10,000 times 10,000 and
[52:22] that's every time the same it's just
[52:24] like I could die
[52:26] [Music]
[52:27] and at that instant we were just driving
[52:29] a curve in the highway and there was a
[52:33] big bull moose standing right in the
[52:35] middle of the
[52:38] road and it it startled me oh I said I
[52:42] said brother brandom there's a
[52:44] moose and I hadn't gotten a moose and I
[52:47] needed a
[52:48] moose and he just kept driving he never
[52:51] slowed down we were we weren't not going
[52:54] fast he said it's all right brother
[52:57] Eddie just get your gun in your shells
[52:59] and kind of like he's yours sort of
[53:02] thing and he just kept
[53:05] driving he drove up so
[53:08] close that that and I shot that moose
[53:12] and uh we dressed the Moose out and
[53:15] brother bandam sat here just on my left
[53:18] and he sat on the log and we just
[53:20] dressed the Moose out and when we were
[53:23] done we walked back to the car
[53:27] and I I stepped into the car and just
[53:29] closed the door and I can't describe the
[53:32] atmosphere it was it was just so Serene
[53:37] and so marvelous that the after effect
[53:41] of the whole thing and the presence of
[53:45] that
[53:47] person and brother Brown
[53:50] said every time he
[53:52] comes something good
[53:54] happens and I've used that phrase many
[53:57] times every time he comes whether it's
[54:00] in a church service or in a family's
[54:03] life or a home is a distinct atmosphere
[54:09] of the person of the Lord Jesus Christ
[54:12] and every time he comes something good
[54:15] happens
