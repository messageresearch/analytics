greetings from a small group in phoenix and to you if you're watching god bless you those that are watching via the internet god bless you if you'd be so kind as to stand as we go into the word you turn in your scriptures to john chapter 13 verse 34 and 35. a new commandment i give unto you that you love one another as i have loved you that you also love one another by this shall all men know that you are by this shall all men know that you are my disciples if you have love for your friends by this shall all men know you are my disciples if if you have love for only your family disciples are familiar by this shall all men know that you are my disciples if you have love for some but not everyone else by this shall all men know that you are my disciples if you have love for those that love you back absolutely not absolutely by this shall all men know that you are my disciples if you have loved one to another. most gracious heavenly father father is celestial as we approach your throne of grace and mercy this eve father i take myself completely out of the way father that it will be you that will speak to your people father may they be blessed this evening from your word oh lord may bring healing that the lord gave me quite some time ago the chain of fellowships with the thought of reconcile your brother reconciliation when they shared the video of the report when the group went to uganda one of the parts that really stood out to me when brother caleb was speaking of the bulls of bashan and he was having the brothers interlock their arms together along another line this was the thought that the lord had given me okay also when he was speaking in fort collins and he called up several of the youth and told them you are an end and you're in and you are an end and then a quote from his message was the ministry of the seven angel was to get all the loose ends and tie them all together and when the message has tied it all together it is no more a bunch of ends but it is one he is the chain of circumstances that binds them a circumstance not a bunch of signs not a bunch of ants no more not a bunch of events and then he read is this the sign of the answer that and he gathers them all up i would like to ask eight youth young men if they can stand up here in the front seat in french right here and i want you guys to do me a favor i want you to interlock your arms together but i want to do it a little differently but the other way one complete circle where your backs are to each other keep going around like this and then you right there amen perfect let me have one more one more brother come up and i'd like to ask you a question because you know this thing always stuck to me that the chain is as strong as the weakest link and a lot of times when one of the lengths of the chain is broken [Music] so for example go in the middle i want you guys to put your arms back together let's say for example for example the judo made a mistake and he has fallen okay and this is the only way is that you have your right a right to turn your back on yes when someone wants to come against your brother that has fallen controversial it doesn't matter what angle they are coming at him from you are there to protect us if i come from this way why not if our brother makes a mistake and in in his weakened weakest condition why don't we we protect them until once again he becomes strong okay join your hands together your arms together now what happens if we cast our brother out or off to the side now you're only seven strong okay i'd like one more to sit down one more to step down that's okay so now we're down to five or a cinco now we're down to four out of cuatro now i want everyone to step down except for one now is he a chain or is he just a link now if he wants to put his arms put your arms together now this is what happens he's trying to join the chain together you get it and now it's more with an attitude of i don't care and if he ties his hands or joins his hands behind him now he is chained to himself he is actually handcuffed i want to read a quote from the message the inside man uh and remember some brother may have fallen some brother may be fallen but don't make him any worse the brotherhood of god and a lot of times when we make mistakes it's easy for us to point a finger is facile or not want to talk to them because for whatever thing he did but who of us is without sin i get the definition of the word reconcile from webster's dictionary the definition reconciliated scenario webster's is to restore to friendship or harmony or harmonia read a quote from brother branham from that time i've got a slogan you think on the slogan do right it's your duty to god it'll grow around you just like some vine and it'll hug you into it if you can't love your enemy just as much as you love those who love you come on brother branham was talking about not to not read the whole quote about a brother that had a problem a lot of monobranam anesthetic about brother branham setting someone on the platform that they thought didn't wasn't baptized and brother brandon said this man said di say my random esteem we're drawing a little ring and we're drawing you out of the circle brother brandon responded to him and i said then i'm going to draw a little ring and draw you back in again that's it bring you right back and you can't put me out just if you turn into your scriptures on first corinthians 12 0. for as the body is one and half many members and all the members of that one body being many are one body so also is christ which is for by one spirit we are all baptized into one body whether we be jews or gentiles whether we be bonder free and have been made and have been all made to drink into one spirit but the body is not one member but many if the foot shall say because i am not the hand i am not of the body is it therefore not of the body and if the ear shall say because i am not the i i am not of the body is it therefore not of the body if the whole body were an eye where were the hearing if the hole were hearing where were they smelling but now has god set the members every one of them in the body as it had pleased him and if they were all one member where were the body but now are they many members yet but one body and i cannot say unto the hand i have no need of thee nor again the head to the feet i have no need of you much more of those members of the body which seem to be more feeble are necessary and those members of the body which we think to be less honorable upon those unpandes we bestow more abundant honor and our uncomely parts have more abundant comeliness [Music] have no need but god has tempered the body together having given more abundant honor to that part which lacked there should be some schism in the body there should be no schism in the body but that the members should have the same care one for another but and whether one members suffer all the members suffer with it discord disharmony this default harmonia you know a lot of times which is this is some of us might say decimus in the body of christ i want to be the right arm or i want to be the shoulders or i want to be this part but how many pero quantos have you dusted this i want to be the souls of the feet without the souls of the thief how is that body going to get around you know and that's how beautiful i was reading a quote brother branham christianity versus idolatry part every sickness even death itself is under your feet under you oh i can just imagine glory lauria i don't feel like i was 52 this morning if i can just get this church to see that brother iglesias we will gloria now god wrote it in his word that that should be sufficient and the message fellowship is but and different gifts into the church the difference is don is in like lesia what to to do what scatter the church no but to draw the church together for the perfecting of the body of jesus with all signs and wonders in it is see what maybe they're having a problem or maybe they have need of something a lot of times you don't know if the lord allows you to go through something in your life it could be for that one time if someone is passing through the same thing that the same thing happened to me i went through the same thing and if you can do that you can help that person you can reconcile that brother back into the fellowship reconciliation i remember one time in church recording iglesia this was after the lord took my dad to dispose to mommy padre the brother was giving a testimony dermano estaba testimonial and he admitted that he wasn't living right and as i was listening to him i went home and i started thinking of what he was saying and i remember i asked the lord lord in because to me i think but the lord's perfect in everything he does but you know in our finite mind we think that we know everything but how could you take my dad being who he is the work that he was doing the help that he was doing and you [Music] saved this brother's life this brother that should have died that wasn't even living right you see a lot of times we begin to judge people we see that if they do something and right away as the example that we gave earlier we want to cast them to the side immediately so then it is not of him that willeth nor of him that run but of god that's but knowing that my my father my dad was ready to go my father i and you know a lot of times i i looked at him and he was just my dad and after he left this positive way to me what i mean then i realized who he was i realized who he is you know a lot of times we take people for granted which is and we don't like i was talking to a brother in the back brother seth and he was talking to brother jimmy talking how he just wants to be a sponge just to soak everything up with this ministry here but you know everything all things work together for good and i know that i was talking to a minister friend of mine and i couldn't understand why i never took advantage of my father to soak up everything all his knowledge that he had of this message because i remember when we were here the one of the last times when my son spoke you know is that the lasso this is that he said he's been in this message for 30 something years but the message has only was only in him for a couple of years you know and as i was speaking to that friend of mine telling them how how could this and i know that that uh that the lord has a a greater purpose for me but for each and every one of them you know a lot of times i love that where brother branham said because you may think sitting here in church you don't know of what's sitting right here in front of us and i know that if you guys would only know what you have here the ministry that's here in minnesota it's so beautiful that we have we hear it sunday after sunday after sunday because as as we are going through bible studies back back home for example if we were to have it today without fail sin fighter whoever speaks behind the sacred desk the lord vindicates wednesday's bible study yes question you two have to be talking to each other there is no way that the message that comes forth on sunday domingo that's right down the line la mismalinia from wednesday without you guys saying one word i can't even put that i just it's mind-boggling blows my mind and finally really i finally realized oh they were talking all right oh it's down orlando but but they weren't talking to each other it's the holy spirit in the ministry speech how could it be so perfect from genesis to revelation says the genesis has apocalypse thousands of years apart miles de ano is apart and it's so perfect because god doesn't make mistakes there's only one thing that god can't do sometimes i'm just speechless of what seeing the lord moving so in the supernatural story in the message a testimony upon the sea in the that you know as i'm driving i'm listening to him in my headset you know and a lot of times you know as you're driving which i'll listen to sometimes we're there you know sun drive with two hands i'm driving one amano i've seen some people drive with their knees but i wanted to raise my hand so much when he said the word weave now these brethren are signing on different parts of god's great lake ora now i come up here in this little city to weave my net with yours i got three children at home they go through sijos in la casa i go get ice cream three different kinds the three different classes one one's vanilla one one strawberry and one one's chocolate chocolate and when i come with ice cream looks like a rainbow but but it's but look it's all ice cream peres the flavor doesn't count there we are brother estamos hermanos we're all eating ice cream and how many of us here agree with everybody on on this message i would find it hard to believe that everybody is 100 and i was looking at the word weave to become united in principle is is the nursing principle relationship in relation or interest when interest and aren't we marching towards the same goal or do you only want to be part of that body of the lord jesus christ don't you want your brother and your sister to be there is let no corrupt communication proceed out of your mouth but that which is good to use to the use of edifying that it may minister grace and to the years parallel and grieve not the holy spirit of god whereby ye are sealed unto the day of redemption at all bitterness and wrath and anger and clamor and evil speaking be put away from you with all one to malice tenderhearted forgiving one another even as god for christ's sake has forgiven you knows what did our lord jesus christ say when he was dying on the cross father forgive them for they know not what they do your father no sovereign do you have the very life of jesus christ in you wouldn't you want to say the same thing for someone else father forgive them for they know not what they do in the message the baptism of the holy spirit you say well this guy did a certain thing while hermana blamed the devil the culpa diablo that's the one who caused it first peter 1 22 pedro uno entidos seeing ye have purified your souls and obeying the truth through the spirit unto unfeigned love of the brethren see that you love one another with a pure heart fervently espiritu de corazon matthew 18 matthew chapter 18 verse 15 to 18. brother abraham god bless you it's good to see you i love you brother moreover if thy brother shall trespass against thee go and tell your neighbor moreover if thy brother shall trespass against thee go tell someone else let me agree with you moreover if that brother shall trespass against thee go post it on social media situation you can light a little brush or but when we put something on social media it's worldwide just like this for everybody to give their own opinion and it's either going to be they're either going to take your side or they're going to take the other person i remember my dad said one time he used to say it all the time there's three sides to every story i tres lados in cala historia yes there's three sides to every coin there's his side estella there's my side milado and then there's the truth so how do we know what's the truth if someone says something how do we know what if it's true if we haven't heard the story of the other brothers we are too quick to to take sides with someone without knowing the truth how would you like to go to court and the prosecutor says this person did this this this and this person and without hearing the defense the jury says guilty quest how much more should we how that we should feel towards our brother or our sister aren't they part of the body of jesus christ moreover if thy brother shall trespass against thee go and tell him his fault between thee and him alone yes and he shall hear thee thou has gained thy brother solos at but if he will not hear thee then take with thee one or two more that in the mouth of two or three witnesses every word may be established but if he will hear and if he shall neglect to hear them sell it unto the church but if he neglect to hear the church let him be unto thee as a heathen for verily i say unto you whosoever whatsoever ye shall bind on earth shall be bound in heaven and whatsoever ye shall loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven you know but if your brother or sister you see that they make a mistake you absolutely have every right to go talk about it but not to your brother but don't go talk to your sister or us thank you to god you'll say lord what can i do to help him or pray for him pray for her i was speaking to a minister one time he was mentioning to me and this goes way back before there was even pagers or cell phones or telephones and he he was telling me that you know as you guys have here how the time changes you either put the time forward or or you set it back well there was a brother in his church that forgot to change the time hermanos and he got to church early an hour early you know nowadays yes that'd be easy just take out your phone telephone call call your brother call your sister but back then so the brother didn't have a choice but to wait till he got home and it was probably the longest drive of his life because when he got to church because he got there on time according to what he thought yeah he was there 30 minutes earlier actually he was an hour and a half but when he got there he thought the rapture had happened and he was left so upon arriving to the house that's why i said it must have been the longest ride of his driver of his life oh i you know for example oh i gotta call brother caleb because if he's not here then surely the rapture happens so the brother gets home everybody was on their way to church so when he got there and he called the brother did not answer and he was maybe the rapture happened and i missed and that's how we think sometimes we are we automatically judge people yes automatically and that's why there's going to be so many disappointments and when he didn't answer the phone either i don't know what he thought jono said because at that point we were falling off the chair laughing because i probably would have thought the same way and speaking from personal experience i remember when and it's sad to think this way or to say this the truth is i remember when my daughter was two maybe two three years old we got up one morning and she was nowhere to be found and i say that it's sad to say this is and she said nothing. nothing called her we searched the house and down every room and she could not be found what went through my mind is how that other brother thought is pencil that i wasn't serving the lord i thought going to church on sunday morning was good enough oh i got a good message this morning can you know something that's going to last me all week oh by sunday by the time i got out of church i didn't remember what the brothers said didn't pick up the bible on monday tuesday very rarely did i go to church on wednesday and i honestly thought that the rapture had come and then after thinking that way a couple seconds later minutes later i it felt like an eternity she pops her head out from behind the couch and that to me was like the happiest day of my life he is and even then as a parent you would probably want to spank your child for not answering you the first time the second time the third time the fourth time el nino do you know without a shadow of a doubt savvy stetson sombra de duda that if you were to go today that you've made everything right just something to think about is algo de pensar and in closing serrando how things change from the time when my daughter was hiding come on come on not too long ago i went to a family member's house we opened the door of rimos la puerta and we ring the doorbell nobody answered [Music] seems like they just came home from buying groceries my mind was because something had changed within me via cambiado dentro de and then after they came home oh we went to this and this and where they were at the question was asked me when you didn't find anybody did you think the rapture happened now my answer was different response can you say without a shadow of a doubt in sombra de duda that you know you're right that you are right with god this is something to think about i'm not even with hearing what the message that brother caleb brought forth on sunday the golden age i know jose because i used to think that way if i was sitting right there where you're sitting right now that brother caleb spoke with me hermano caleb that's why the holy spirit the way he moves the way he works that's what that's why i used to think that surely these they have to be tough and then for a while it became like a run like a running joke you and i think it not that it didn't solidify for me but i knew that when a visiting minister would come from out of town pueblo and there have been many ianavido muchos so i know that this lord he's moving in such a supernatural way you don't realize how privileged you are this evening the ministry here in this place this is a special place to me it's so good to be here i love you all with all my heart you know just let us love one another even as christ loved the church and gave his life he died for you [Music] he died for me for me he died for each and every one of us because truly he doesn't want any to perish but he knows who would accept be so kind as to bow your head most gracious heavenly father lord this evening i love you so much [Music] father we are such terrible times than when i was growing up the lord is getting harder and harder much harder you must deficiently i can't even imagine lord how it's going to be for my grandchildren i know without a shadow of a doubt i know i do not know what tomorrow holds and lord made may there be such an outpouring of your spirit just wherever we may go lord may we just cry out to you it does we don't have to be in church this is just a building each and every one of us lord caldwell nosotros are the church of jesus christ almost where jesus christ abideth we are the church nosotros and that's who you're coming for yes her father truly you said and your bride has made herself ready father while there's still time you're so merciful and you're giving us time after time after time and i know lord a lot of times it just seems like a cliche you just say muchas [Music] and lord if we are right within our own self father may we cry out for our brother may we cry out for our sister may we cry out for those that have need of thee oh lord you know the heart in each and every one of your children even those that are watching online lord you're right there is oh father as we were taught the other day to bring our petition before you that and to cry out to you with thanksgiving knowing that you've already answered even though it hasn't been made manifest lord but you've already answered as we were told it took the angel 21 days to get to daniel how long did it take the promise to come forth to abraham i don't even know lord if i could wait that long but lord he was abraham was wavered not but no no but was strong lord jose giving praise unto you lord even though because he knew that it would be a greater miracle yet from the first day the promise came up to when he would hold that baby in his arms oh lord may we have that faith of abraham lord to hold on to the promises that you've given unto us father every promise in the bible is ours whether it's healing and that's one thing you cannot fail at your word and i thank you lord gracias i give you all the honor and the glory and the praise gloria for lord only you are worthy of it because i ask you all these things in the precious name of the lord amen amen amen [Applause] [Music] what a day
