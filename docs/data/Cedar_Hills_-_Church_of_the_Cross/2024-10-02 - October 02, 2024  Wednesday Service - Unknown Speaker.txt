Freddy contas and our brother Marcus Christopherson marus and we apologize we won't be interpreting these videos due to time and right after the videos we'll have our ministers come up amen God bless you for good morning and God bless you everyone my name is brother Mike Harrell from Phoenix and this is my Africa report um I'd like to start by uh sending uh greetings from brother Tim Perez and the rest of the Phoenix group and then I'd also like to thank uh Pastor Caleb and of course brother Tommy and the rest of the the missionary team that uh that I travel with to Uganda um some of the most amazing guys that I've ever known in my life and then also to um our team there in Uganda uh led by one of the most humble most beautiful uh men that I've ever met in my life uh brother Julius um I'd also like to just State the obvious to me which is we serve a wonderful God that we serve a Living God and I think sometimes we lose sight of that uh with things that we go through and things that we're dealing with I think sometimes we forget who we are and and the the simple fact that our God is real and that our God is always there for us and our God will always take care of us we just have to look for him we have to call on him and and he will be there so if if we could uh I'd like to read a scripture um Claus uh 49-12 and I'm sorry but I'm going to have to read this I wish I could be there in person but unfortunately I wasn't able to make it this weekend so if you would just please kind of bear with me and I kind of jotted down some notes so I wouldn't forget to say some things it's kind of hard to have the Holy Spirit move you when when you're doing everything on video like this but uh Ecclesiastes 4 4 9-12 simply reads two are better than one because they have a good reward for their labor for if they fall the one will lift up his fellow but woe to him that is alone when he falleth for he hath not another to help him up again if two lie together then they have heat but how can one be warm alone and if one Prevail against him two shall withstand him and a three-fold cord is not quickly broken and in this case uh I believe this missionary team that traveled to Africa was a three-fold court if not a 22-fold court if that does exist uh because our first meeting in Uganda which is typically what we do after we arrive in country uh we sit down as a team uh led by Pastor Caleb and he informed us of the vision that that brother Diego had had of the four demons being released and that they would uh commit themselves to being obstacles for us during that missionary trip and for a lot of us those obstacles be and I think some of the brothers have already mentioned it those obstacles began before some of us even bought our tickets as soon as we begin to talk about this trip and the fact that the Lord had placed it on our hearts to go a lot of us began having issues whether it was financially personally whatever a lot of us began having issues um once we arrived in country we had our meeting we started doing our thing um of course as soon as we we connect with the the people of Uganda we go and we go do our our first uh meeting with brother James and his village there and and then we have the first conferences uh I thought last year when I had the opportunity to travel to Uganda that man these people are on fire for the lord well this time was even more so and and I don't think it was just simple fact that it was a you know uh a lot of different people on the team this year uh I don't think that had anything to do with it although you know that was motivation for me uh more motivation but the people there are still hungry for the word the people there are still hungry for the Lord and they make it so easy for us to feel that anointing and to want to be there and to want to work with them and to want to help them uh receive that Revelation that they're looking for um I I love the opportunities that I get to travel like this um one of the things that I that really moved me this time was the simple fact that several Brothers on the team were able to travel and experien this with their sons um I know prior to me leaving and a few times while I was in Uganda my seven-year-old son MJ asked if he could be there with me and I promised him by the time that he turns 15 or 16 years old if the Lord prevails that we will make that trip together um forgive me if the Lord terries that we will make that trip together and after seeing these brothers there with their sons I'm even more motivated to make sure that we're in the position that we need to be in to make that happen when he's old enough to travel um I that's just something that moved my heart and I love seeing it uh um one of the things that that uh also moved me during this trip was the fact that once again I got to get to know brothers that I truly didn't know uh that I've seen at church that I've maybe even had a a brief conversation with shared a hug with shook a hand with I got to know them even better and that makes once again that makes this this type of trip when you're away from your family it makes it even easier to deal with um and I'm going to start with and and please forgive me but uh there's a lot of things that take place on these trips that you know as we're getting to know each other we learn different personalities so forgive me if I humor you just a little bit but it's just something that I really wanted to share with everyone and I'm going to start with young brother Adan I I love that kid I i' seen him a few times on camera I've seen him at church uh didn't know he was brother Mar chabz a son um or at least I didn't remember but one of the things that I loved about Young Brother Adon is is what I started calling him is that kid had the most delicious food on his plate every time we sat down to have a meal now I got to a point to where I I couldn't eat very much towards you know the halfway through the trip but to sit next to that kid or be in an an I view of what he was eating on this plate made me hungry every single time that we had a meal then there was uh Young Brother Paul and you know I've seen uh brother Paul up on the platform before uh during some of the youth services where you know you just see um you kind of see his personality a little bit but to be there and experiences personality in person he is such a dynamic personality and he loves to say Yeah Boy a lot so during this trip Paul had me in laughter pretty much every time I was around him whether we're on the bus traveling or in the hotel just listening to him talking being engaged in conversation with him was just completely humorous to me I love that kid then there's young Ethan who uh course I've been around Ethan several times uh but usually with Ethan he's very stoic when he's around me um and maybe others um you see him he's so professional when he's up on the platform he's going from instrument to instrument or he's lead singing and I I'm honestly really inspired by that kid but to be around Ethan and actually see him crack jokes and laugh and have fun uh was something that I really ired and I love that about him so young Ethan I really really got to know a lot better and then there's my my 5% African brother uh Brother Carlos who uh I will forever uh uh well forever he will be known to me as uh Dr Carlos in the orange vest of safety um because if it hadn't been for Dr Carlos uh my last couple days in Uganda would have been a lot harder uh my travel back would have been close to Impossible uh but Dr Carlos had exactly what I needed to to get my body under control the last two days that we were in country and I thank you brother Carlos God bless you brother I love you uh and I really do appreciate you and then there's uh brother Jerry Delo who will be affectionately known from now on as a wild man because under the anointing of the missionary field I saw aside of brother Jerry that I've never seen before and I absolutely loved it and it was great to get to know brother Jerry uh once again I think the first conversation I ever had with him was that after I gave my testimony uh the first time I see their Hills and he came up and he met me in the pastor's office and gave me a hug and said thank you and after that I don't think we ever really had a conversation uh but on this trip I really got to know him and I love me some brother Jerry and then there's brother Robert and brother Marcos uh from now on to me will be known as The Wrecking Crew because there was not one dinner table that dinner table that those two didn't wreck um those guys can eat uh brother Robert probably had more snacks than any person I've ever met in my life uh and and hopefully I'm not getting anyone in trouble but to see someone sit down and try every dessert on the menu just absolutely blew my mind especially when I was in a situation where I really couldn't eat anymore uh but those guys were great I love their testimonies especially brother Robert I got to talk to him a little bit the back of the bus I love his testimony um I love the fact that the Lord placed it on his heart to go to the radio station and to share that with the people of Africa then there's brother uh Freddy from Norway who probably had the the best protein bars that I've ever had in my life an abundance of protein bars that he shareed with us um but what I really loved about brother Freddy was his spirit uh the simple fact that with everything that we went through in Uganda all of the obstacles we faced we had a moment at the airport coming home where he said to me what brother what what obstacles did we face and to me uh it touched my heart and when I say this I don't mean to be rude or crude but he was totally oblivious to some of the things that we faced while we were there I believe believe and and I don't mean that in a bad way but to me it just shows me his it showed me his Spirit and the fact that he's a kind and loving person and that obviously one that that's not easily agitated or um disturbed by things that are happening and then also to see him interact with the people it didn't matter where we were he found a way and he found time to go and interact with the people and you and I love that about him because you can tell he loved people that he loves people and he's a very caring person and then there's the person that will probably be affectionately known as Dora the Explorer and I mean that out of the kindness of my heart for brother Titus from Fort Collins uh he and I and brother Tim uh were stranded in Doha we had to stay Theon night and if it hadn't been for brother Titus I'm sure brother Tim Garcia and I would have gone straight to the hotel grabbed dinner and gone to bed but brother Titus convinced us to uh tra driver and see the city and have a great uh Bangladesh meal and there something that we probably would not have experienced if it hadn't been for brother Titus so brother Titus my brother I it was great to get to know you I love you God bless you can't wait until we can experience another new town or New City together and then my Primo brother Omar uh I love you brother and once again Primo I forgive you for last year um but I also thank you because if it hadn't been for you last year um really expressing what that type of trip can do to a person I never would have ventured out and and and followed my heart I believe it was the Lord's will for me to go last year as well and I did it but I did it with your help and I really appreciate it it was great to have you there this year hopefully next year we will be there again together um my mother thinks I'm crazy for wanting to go again I I I know she was joking when she said it um but when I told her next year this is what I'm expecting to happen she thought I had lost my mind but uh God willing uh if there's a trip next year I will definitely be there and then um uh I want to just hit on a few things really serious real quick um excuse me and let's start with what I had the opportunity to learn in Uganda um and I don't know for for some that are wavering about going um I would say if the Lord places us on your heart to go to Uganda or any missionary trip that you do it because I learned so much on these the last two trips that I've taken there these are things that I'll carry with me forever uh but as the the brothers there are learning I'm also learning I'm taking notes and I'm learning about church order and I'm I got to hear about the the dimensions again and things like that and to hear the brothers from Gulu uh some of the questions that they posed to the missionary team that we we we we grouped up we we separated into groups and we addressed some of the questions that they had um with the help of of uh brother Jimmy who we also missed and brother Abraham um a Elder um it was awesome to be able to to see the questions that they had and to seek the answers uh for them to help them receive that Revelation was very rewarding for us and that's something that I will always cherish as well and then um to be a part of the the placing of the Bible in the Cornerstone to experience what that meant to the people of manafa um to experience what that meant to the people that are part of our team that participated in that to have one of the customade pens that my wife made uh for the for brother Caleb for pastor Caleb uh to hand out to the church two years ago to have one of those pens placed in that Bible and placed in the Cornerstone uh is something that I'll always remember and always cherish um I I I've never imagined myself being a part of something so special um and something that that means so much to someone else to be a part of that for me is lifechanging um and I I think everyone should have an opportunity to experience that so if the Lord places it on your heart to make that trip please do and then uh last but not least um for brother will uh you said something very profound uh when you spoke the other night um and I'm just going to read this because I don't want to mess it up um but you spoke about the finding the founding Pastor Le a Heritage and and I simply wrote sadly for me I didn't have the honor of knowing him however I did have the the honor of knowing his brother uh who's also my wife's grandfather brother Michael Perez and the amazing sons that he has Pastor Caleb brother Tommy and brother will the opportunity to be around uh these men and the ministry that the founding Pastor has formed at Cedar Hills um and having the opportunity to learn from each and every one of them um I do feel that I I do know him uh and I feel that I am also part of that Heritage that he left behind and I I love you guys I thank you for all you do I thank you for everything you've done for myself and my family I thank you for helping me find my way to the Lord uh I will be forever grateful and I cannot wait to uh take another trip another missionary trip with that team or any team that Pastor Caleb puts together or gu puts together and I would you know simply like to end with don't forget Africa uh thank you and God bless you [Applause] good morning friends God bless you a week before traveling to Uganda I spoke with brother Tommy Jr I wanted to ask some questions about the food about uh certain practical things and something that uh couch uh couch my attention was what uh that brother Tommy told me that when you return from Africa you return a better person a better father a better son a better husband a better neighbor it makes an impact having that experience of being in Uganda to see and witness how God is working through this ministry in Uganda in a special and particular way and the fruit that is giving I do not take things lightly the privilege of having been a witness and reading our names in the Bible that was placed as a Cornerstone uh for the construction of the church something that CAU my attention and I really like it about the Beautiful People of Uganda is is the way and the freedom they have in their singing in their dancing worshiping and I saw even to the service hasn't started they are rejoicing and celebrating I can also say I remember the service in in Manawa was a really something tremendous for me the preaching of the war of the brothers the atmosphere the spirit of the Lord was there I heard it was it were around about 600 people gathering in total 200 of them children there was not there wasn't enough room for everyone in the church it was full of adults and children sitting on the floor and many others with mothers with the with their children sitting on the ground outside the church I was next to the window and I could see many childrens and adults who came to the window to be able to listen and see and participate in the services in the service they also raise their hands and I saw them praying as well they make me appreciate what we really have both in the church during the service and uh it make me also a impact when I saw so many childrens outside quing up just to receive at a small candy seeing the Beautiful People of Uganda the Simplicity in which they live the needs they have seen so many childrens without shoes with old clothes but still smiling they are happy people they play with very humble things they express what they have inside they are they are very very happy people it made me remember the words that brother Brandon said brother bran said in question questions and answers well look the color man he has he has got a disposition about him that the white man never does have he has got a happy go lucky and trust God and just let the rest of it Go whether he has got it or whether he hasn't he's happy anyhow and brother says I'd like to have a whole lot of that tonight I sure would well he has got it and that's his position they don't want to mix up with some other race and break it out either that's exactly right with so many dangers on the road with so many children and people walking on the roads so many motorcycles and crazy traffic in Uganda we could really see the hand of God protecting us through the Journey I could see so many motorcycles that they almost CED with with the bus on another occasion the bus was going to enter a gas station and I saw a car that was coming at full speed and it stopped just a few centimeters before hitting the bus things like that were something we uh could see but we were always protected from any accident when um when we we're on the way to Gulu and we had two buses for the team and a car for the sweet cases and before crossing a bridge the police wouldn't let uh the police wouldn't let us cross because they said it was too heavy and we were there for a long time and the drivers tried to talked to the police and they decided already that the car couldn't cross so I heard that the car had to stay there and that we had to carry our suitc cases inside carry our suitcases inside the buses with us so we we were all carrying our bags and our driver brother Godfrey was inside the bus lifting the bags and putting them on the seat this was an obstacle for us having to place all the sweet cases inside the bus with us when we had already when we had already loaded our bags onto the buses we suddenly heard that uh we could put our bags back into the car the police the police had changed their mind I heard that brother Benjamin the pastor from bugiri had spoken to the police and said this he said the Servants of the Lord are here we need all our things and we cannot leave anything here the car is part of the trip and suddenly they change their mind and allow us to cross the bridge and continue on our way to Guru that was madebe an impact for me to see that to see so many preachers and pastors gathering together all hungry for the word of God to learn more and to receive what God had for them in these conferences to see the spirit of God present the team that was presenting the different offices in the church and the special anointing in the teachings and preaching by Brother Caleb I heard um I heard several times from the brothers in Uganda I thank you thank you for loving the people of Uganda thank you for your your support thank you for your love thank you for being here I heard these testimonies from the people I was able to speak to in Uganda so now I can also testify as brother Tommy told me before that this trip changed our lives and for me it's still an impact and now I want to share my personal testimony Brothers something that shows that God is bigger than we can imagine sometimes people have the tendency to limit God when we pray little did I know that I had to travel thousands of miles to Africa to be able to tell this testimony to you for a long time ago I have prayed to God to be able to see an angel to see something Supernatural not because I have any doubts I believe in that but the privilege of being able to see in nanga the first place we visit outside the church cat my attention a group of small children and I asked them to gather around so I could take a picture the next day while reviewing uh I was watching the the the photos I could see a brighter light that stood out in the photo and in a special way I could clearly clearly see at the face of a young man there I show it into my show it to my pastor brother Morton and he told me to show to brother Caleb and he confirmed that it was an Angel and even to I had to travel thousands of miles to Uganda God answer my prayer in a bigger way than I expect expected no not when I expected but in his time and this is not just a testimony for me alone but I believe this is the testimony for many others as well I can testify of the great things that God has done and is still doing that the supernatural was present on this trip that the angels of God were present confirming that the vision that was given continues even today and from the bottom of my heart I want to thank my wife who has always supported me and prayed for us I also want to thank my pastor brother Morton for allowing me to travel together and a special thanks to our brother Pastor kalef for uh allowing me to have this Unforgettable and blessed trip to Uganda God bless you all [Applause] Shalom hi brothers and sisters today I will I give you a a report from the Uganda trip I recently was on and and wow what a trip and wow what was it accomplished on that trip I just want to say thank you to everybody down in Uganda for for giving me the this experience to to showing me me this love that you all showed me and I also want to say thank you to to the team that I went together with I want to to thank my to thank my pastor for for allowing me to join this trip I want to thank brother Caleb for allowing me to to going to go on this trip along with the with the whole team and um wow this this trip really changed my life so I want to read a scripture from from psalms 27 and we'll read verse 1 to5 the Lord is my light and my salvation Whom Shall I Fear the Lord is the strength of my life of whom shall I be afraid when the wicked even my enemies and my foes come upon me to eat of My Flesh they stumbl and fell though and host should encamp against me my heart shall not fear though War should raise against me in this will I be confident one thing have I desired of the Lord that will I seek after that I may dwell in the house of the Lord all the days of my life to behold the beauty of the Lord and to inquire in his Temple for in the time of trouble he shall hide me in in his Pavilion in the secret of his Tabernacle shall he hide me he shall set up upon a rock may the Lord richly add a blessing to the reading of the scripture and to be able to to join a trip like this it's it's just amazing it's it's God's grace uh all true and I I also need to to thank my my my family for for allowing me to travel because when when when we traveling on a trip like this it's it's not the only the men that travels is also all the the wies that's uh that's being back home they they go through the same fight and the trials so so so so a big thank to them for for what they do and for for for all of their prayers so I had uh one intention of going on this trip and that was to become a true witness instead of of telling that oh we do missionary Works in in Uganda and and this and this are are happening and it's a revival going on and we can see now the Revival is is is happening other places in the world I I wanted to go down to Uganda where the Revival started uh back uh some years ago and to become to become that true witness to see it with my own eyes and now I have been there and I'm a true witness and I can say thank you Lord and everything I have heard in all the reports that has been that has been given uh on on earlier trips I can say that it's it's true and what's being said are are really happening in Uganda and you can see more and more people are being added uh to the body of Christ and and people are are are are eager to to get a hold of what Jesus Christ wants to give to his his his bride so uh the reason I I read this scripture was because of the the vision that was was given us the second second day on the trip brother Caleb was explaining that that brother Diego had received a vision and the vision showed that it was fear amongst the Brethren uh in the team and and also that that four big demons was was let out of the four fourth uh Dimension to attack us and to to give us obstacles on the trip and we know that that that God uh he gives us strength and as we read that the Lord is my light and my salvation Whom Shall I Fear so so we were given we were given this this vision and and and brother Caleb said that the only way we can overcome this obstacles and we can we can overcome this fear amongst us was to pray when when we saw the obstacles coming and after this we we we we traveled to manafa we met Pastor Rogers and that is the the place where the first church church is is being built to and and we also placed the the Cornerstone there we we took a Bible and everybody in the team wrote their name in in in that Bible and we we sealed it into a brick uh and U and as we know the scripture says that Jesus Christ himself being the chief corner Stone so so this this church that uh that Jesus Christ is is talking about is is placed upon the foundation of the Apostles and Prophets and Jesus Christ himself being the Chief Cornerstone so we had to make sure that that this was the way that this church church was established and it was amazing to to take part in that and to to pray and to see all the people that that were working there and and to see how they they were were were building this church and we were able to to to join and help to build build this uh some walls we we're placing bricks and and that was amazing to see the the manifestation of of of our vision so what's what really impacted me on this trip was that that we have heard about uh signs and miracles happening uh that people are being healed and miracles happening in in the services but on this trip it it was something something different that was happening it was Supernatural things that that was going on and we had several conferences with with pastors on only and on on every conference we had brother Caleb started off by by preaching and um I would say that wow that was amazing to hear what what the Lord had in store for us through brother Caleb and those sermons that he held it was in itself it it it was life changing uh I I have heard uh preaching on these subjects before but to be down in Uganda and to hear these subjects being being preached it it was totally different different so so the first thing that was preached was the the wind from the north and and then it was it was preaching on Tidings and offerings and uh and last out it was uh preaching on the dimensions and the super Supernatural things that that we saw taking place down in Uganda U I want to explain those Supernatural things by reading a quote from the prophet from from the sermon Moses in 1950 now get these close friends the hardest thing that God has ever had to deal with his people is to get one mortal to believe and H that's the hardest thing God has ever done and we could see down in Uganda that that the hardest thing that God has ever had to deal with was was being D it was pastors that they had traveled far to come and to listen what the team had had in store to to bring to them and and it was it was especially one thing that that took place in in the conference in Gulu I I want to to talk about and that was a a precious brother I will see if I can find a I can find a picture of him uh he was he was after after the conference he he he came over to us and and and he said it's it's this brother he said today I have I have seen God in flesh and oh my that is that is Supernatural the hardest thing for that God has ever done deal with is is to get one mortal to believe another mortal and and here we could see that that the hardest thing was was being happened uh and this this brother he was he was so happy and he said that this this is a total change for me and and and we gave this brother and a tablet where he could have all the messages of of the prophet and he could see pictures he could take pictures and and also to see that during these conferences uh we had teaching on on on how to run the offices in the church the seven offices that operates in the in the church it's the the office of an Pastor the associate pastor the the Deacon the the trustee the treasure the Sunday School attendant and the The Sound and Music Department and all the pastors they they were so happy and they they wanted to learn and to understand how to how to run these things and that really impacted me to see that what's what was going on and and happening on on on this trip was that that God he he wants his his bride to to be hid in his in his Temple and for that to happen his his Temple must be established and we know that the the the bride is the Temple of of Jesus Christ that is supposed to be established and that is go what's going on and and I could see it really happening that this Temple is is being built and the people in Uganda the bride in Uganda they are accepting the the order of God they are accepting ER how to run a church and and and they want they want more teaching of how to operate the church in the right way and as it as psalms 27 reads for in the time of trouble he shall hide me in his Pavilion in the secret of his Tabernacle shall he hide me and brothers and sister I I want to say that this was what I experienced down in Uganda that the church was being is established the the order in the church was being established and and this is making a way for God to to hide his bride when when the times of trouble comes he can hide us and that was also what the vision showed that these demons from the fourth dimension they were let loose to to attack the whole team and and we have heard about all the obstacles that that was on the on on this trip but God has has placed an order God has placed in Temple there for for us to enter and I want to say that if you if you have the opportunity to go on a missionary trip trip like this use the opportunity and and and and go on a trip and become a true witness because the Scripture it will be manifested for you and you will see what's what's going on so God bless you and I'm looking forward to to see you all in Uganda next time and also thank you brother Julius thank you brother Enoch brother laen brother Brian and Pastor Rogers Pastor basil for for everything that that you gave us when when we were in Uganda and God bless you all [Applause] may the Lord bless you this we thank God for the life he gives us right how many can say Amen to that are you glad because you have life are you happy because you have health so then all the honor and glory to the Lord I ask you to please stand and go and read a scripture with me we're going to be reading the book of Hebrews chapter 12 we're going to be reading verse two and the word of the Lord reads like this looking onto Jesus the author and finisher of of our faith who for the joy that was said before him endured the cross the cross despising the shame and is sat down at the right hand of the Throne of God okay the Lord had the blessing to reading of his word you may be seated I believe that this scripture speaks clear to us right looking on to Jesus we thank God he has taken us and brought us back with well with Wellness was a privilege to be with Brother David [Music] thank God that he received us with all good I want to tell you that he's a great brother he's a great friend please keep our brother in prayers and he sends you all greetings I believe that you will send greetings to them right why don't you turn to the camera and say hi to himas say Brother David thank you thank you for your attention he treated us of the best it was also a privilege to go with brother jimy I believe and I share brother William's words he said that he missed brother Jimmy and I have no words to express it may God bless her brother a great servant of God let us give a hand to her brother truly I believe as every elder brother that we have I always the white hairs of every brother every brother should take the title of as an elder and I wanted to uh take it as experience because you learn a lot from them that's why I read the scripture looking onto Jesus and we could look at Jesus on the past well I want to share you what I saw I did not look onto Jesus 2,000 years ago I wasn't even born 50 years ago so I can't talk about that I can talk about this of the Jesus that I have known in this day through his bride through his children through his daughters because if in this day God has descended and he has pleased him to dwell in Sons and Daughters redeemed and saved by grace that they have been courageous and forsaking everything serving the lord Jesus Christ and we thank God for [Laughter] belonging or being part to of those that have been called of those that have been chosen those that have been predestin to take the Good Tidings of the gospel and that is you it is you sitting down with your life are the light the light of the Gospel where it has pleased God that that he dwells in you now I believe with all my heart I was talking to a person and this person told me times are getting difficult uh they're getting difficult every time it's getting hard hard and I said don't be thinking about that because as it is as a negative power is coming down I want to tell you brother and sister that the power the Lord Jesus Christ also being manifested and His glory and his fullness who give to know the virtues of that one that called us out of if you can't believe it brother and sister if you want if you can share it and I'm going to share this with you from the prophet it says I say this the message hearing recognizing and acting on the word of God it says I say this and I'll finish the true church who is the true church here the true bride has a lot to live for they have a lot to walk for it's the chosen church it's the Beloved bride you know you know it in your heart you have passed from Death to life and your life way of being describes it you look look at yourself and see watch watch yourselves and see all the things all the things you have gone through and this evening you and I each one of us we have a testimony in our lives each one of us we have a miracle in our life to say how great things the Lord Jesus Christ done with each one of us all your objective all your your sight be the Lord Jesus Christ you're waiting for him to come I want to tell you he already here in our midst Rejoice be glad because you been chosen by God and God comes for you one from one moment to the other it says I was standing next to brother fed the other time next to the seashore they're in Puerto Rico looking at the sea and I saw there at the sea everything there and I saw the the big waves walking as in a garden and he told me brother bham this is heaven and I said but the sea in heaven is still H just after crossing the sea over there there's a place called Heaven there's a place called heaven where the Lord Jesus Christ dwelt the one who redeemed you the one who redeemed me for us over there the prophet says that one day the Lord Jesus took away all my sins he sent them to the Sea of for forgot about everything I was forgot everything I did and he made me pure made me clean made me sit places Christ Jesus time to give Glory because he forgave me I was bound now I'm free I was condemned I'm I was lost found and in heaven the Lord Jesus Christ is waiting for me open arms there's a sea but there's no W there a quiet sea the Lord Jesus Christ looking onto Jesus Colossians chapter 3 says verse two uh set your affection on things above not on things on earth because you are for ye are dead life is hid with Christ in God now brother and sister if the days are getting more difficult Rejoice because also the power of God is getting greater on his children on his bride Isaiah say arise for thy life has come and upon you upon who say upon shall the sun of rightousness arise I don't think you want to overlook it that's what God has given to his bride his people and we thank God that he has permitted us to go and come back with all good after the service in the afternoon it was surprising to We were finishing eating and all the brothers they surrounded brother Jimmy it was a very beautiful or nice SC to me it's not the man it's God I remember one time brother Tommy pis s he said he said these words he said I'm not honoring the man I'm honoring the god that is in the man so in this evening we thank God and after a couple hours we had another service and they would ask a question to brother Jimmy and then he would ask another question I was writing notes behind him because I was also nurturing myself I said brother Jimmy wow I said wow wow I said wow and God bless his servant God bless each servant each one of you thank you for your prayers thank you for praying for each one of us you can surely feel the backup of your prayers we had a good time over there Brother David send your greetings and I also want to thank our pastor for his Trust of having commissioned us may God bless you may God keep you May brother says my brother Jim you inspire me you me vamin give me a of in I officially want to announce we have another preaching machine Among Us his name isero Salvador Guerrero yeah Amen to those that don't understand Spanish do you know what the word gerero means anybody want to tell help some the people in English warrior yeah yeah that's that's that's what he is he's a warrior I I really appreciate him I would like for us to turn in the scriptures to Ephesians chapter 4 very famous scripture we we speak about the fful ministry and so many things out of this chapter but I'm going to put emphasis on a few of the things tonight Ephesians 4 starting with verse three endeavoring to keep the unity of the spirit in the bond of Peace there is one body and one Spirit even as ye are called of one hope of your call one Lord One Faith one baptism brother Benham says baptism of the Holy Ghost one God and Father of all who is above all and through all and in you all do you believe it that he is in you amen this is what I I saw on this trip and sister Karen's dad it was good to see him again I said the next time we come uh Lorenzo and Karen will be with us the Lord Jesus praise the Lord verse S but unto every one of us let's say that together but unto every one of us not unto me to every one of us amen is given Grace according to the measure of the gift of Christ wherefore he saith when he ascended on high he let captivity captive gave gifts un to men now that he ascended what is it but he also descended first to the lower parts of the earth I I want to stop right there just have a word of prayer Lord Jesus we just thank you for this night Lord for the privilege of your mercy and the breath of life to be able to serve you Lord we thank you now bless your children in the precious name of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ amen amen you notice here for many many years I I've known Brother David Deon actually over 35 years and and I remember when I first started to go to Sal this is way before I even knew there was a brother Tommy Pettis Church of the Cross HS Church of the cross I was going to church Ines with Brother Juan Francisco fio Franc as brother mis's father the Lord rested his Gallant soul in the very beginning when that church started there in Salo why they came out of a Church of Christ of all things and you know what brother B says about the Church of Christ he says socalled Church of Christ and I I I remember brother Ramon Deon RAM and at that time Brother David during that time was the associate pastor brother Ramon there in you know and as as I read this verse where it said that he he ascended on high gave gifts to man but then it said but he first descended to the lower parts of the earth so then as I look back through the years the ministry the bride God's people God's purpose it looks like it went through the lowest parts of the earth if you can understand what I'm talking about and I remember in mil lowest times you remember Brother David he said why brother Jimmy you were one of my first teachers that I ever had confidence in he told me one time me a teacher back then I would have I would have just said well brother I'm just to help but he considered me that and then from that time all the way to this current day uh because of things that have happened in the low times and how the enemy tried to destroy God's Heritage as we heard about yeah and Brother David kind of disclosed himself into a little shell he enclosed himself not because he didn't want to have Fellowship because there were so many things that had gone on so many things that had had done damage among the people of the message and do you see brother David now as he expressed to me he says tell brother Caleb I want to continue this now I've never seen Brother David like this since 35 years ago just to see that and the people were so happy the preaching machine he he he ministered Saturday night brother Salvador I me oh man it was awesome we didn't even have to make an altar call with people just started coming there were healings there was Deliverance people receiving the baptism of the Holy Ghost gifts of God being made manifest right even in the office before we went out God speaking things and then it happens right in front of our eyes we're just grateful to be part of this that was an awesome service Friday I had ministered to the young married couples and reminds me of something brother Tommy said and I know my time will be up here CU 10 15 minutes for me is like eating the last piece of ice in my water cup where there where there's no water in it you know but anyhow ministered to those young couples and and then that service on Saturday then Sunday morning brother Salvador he got to minister to the young people and uh then Sunday well I got that regular service I got to minister a little message entitled The Complex of humanity speaking basically what been speaking here we had two baptisms that so we had a wonderful time but as I as I finish this up I I I want to go to the part of the scripture that I feel the Imp of course we know verse 11 I gave some Apostles some prophets some evangelist pastors teachers we've heard of so much but verses 13 to 16 is what I see happening right now in this moment not minute not hour not day not month not year moment and time till we all come to the the unity of the faith and of the knowledge of the Son of God unto a perfect man unto the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ that we henceforth be no more children tossed to and fro and carried about with every wind of Doctrine that's what happened all those years that caused all the damage by the slight of men and cunning crack whereby they lie wait to deceive but speaking the truth in love may grow up into him in all things which is the head even Christ we're growing up into him we're growing up into the headstone is divine love from whom the whole body fitly joined together compacted by that which every joint supplier I saw a joint in Salo part of the body a connection and there's a supply of God's grace coming through every joint every nerve every cell it's the body is coming together I have desired to see this for over 35 years and I've never lost the vision of this that there's a lot more of the bride of Christ all around us and with us here included may God never let us think that that we're the only ones I'm not saying we do but but I know I I know that Spirit attacks you know why because God attacked me and I almost did what Brother David did for many years but now brother David's coming out I'm coming out go up into him speaking the truth and love as we stand to our feet when Divine love is projected Sovereign Grace takes its place the and when his love projected his feeling Christ stepped out to take his place it required something to take the place his love alone went for for you his love alone went for those two Souls that got baptized and Grace provided a sacrifice for you next paragraph Love is one of the greatest instruments that there is in God's Great economy God is love the Bible said he is love and when you become one of his children you become a part of that love you are a part of God's economy you become subject of his domain and when you do that become a son and daughter of God he said he would give you everlasting life one last thing and we will [Music] pray paragraph 36 I call it B what is it Divine love projected resulted in Sovereign Grace taking its place Divine love can only go so far but when it is held true to the end Sovereign Grace takes its place and produces that which love could not carry out Lord Jesus we're such a privileged people Lord that we would grow up into you and you are love lord it's not so much that your Divine love is coming down lord but we're growing up into your love your Prophet said the time would come that the sick would be healed the people would be delivered we wouldn't have to lay hands on on the people but your love would come down or we would grow up into that love to unite the body of Christ thank you Lord forgive my emotions but I just feel so privileged to have people like you as my brothers and sisters God bless you and we may the spirit of God give you exactly what you need tonight name of Lord Jesus wow hand to the Servants of the Lord Brother Jimmy the Lord

they tell me he's not here he hasn't and come back look son the blessings there something that God is adding to us it's something added to us and when this blessings we don't understand how to manage them could be an obstacle to take us out of the church my friend ask God to teach you stewardship because I see that God will is going to bless you but God has placed you in a place and because he has placed you in that place these blessings they come for you for you but these blessings they could take you out and I'm going to be more clear uh job offers could come where you could you would have to leave this place just be careful son see just be careful son I see blessings but this is something that should not happen the presence of the Lord is here now listen enri please stand look son the
