[1:04:16] brothers
[1:04:18] okay matthew 24 12.

[1:04:25] 24 this is
[1:04:27] jesus speaking of the end time is jesus
[1:04:31] and in matthew 24 12 he says
[1:04:34] and because iniquity shall abound
[1:04:38] multiplication
[1:04:43] amen with that may the lord add his
[1:04:45] blessings to the reading of his word
[1:04:46] you may be seated
[1:04:50] and because iniquity shall abound
[1:04:59] the title this morning might be a little
[1:05:00] bit strange
[1:05:02] [Music]
[1:05:04] might be wondering what we're trying to
[1:05:05] get to here but the title is regarding
[1:05:08] iniquity
[1:05:13] just real quickly so that you understand
[1:05:15] what regard means
[1:05:19] it's something that value is given to is
[1:05:24] it's to acknowledge something it's to
[1:05:27] make something welcome
[1:05:30] it's to justify something that is
[1:05:34] regarding inequity
[1:05:38] and again because iniquity shall abound
[1:05:42] the love of many shall wax
[1:05:47] we have a lot of notes today
[1:06:31] it's a mystery um to just so
[1:06:34] you can understand how i how this
[1:06:36] inspiration came to me
[1:06:40] about iniquity last weekend
[1:06:43] i i drew one of those very cherished
[1:06:46] treasures uh
[1:06:47] on either sex bull or cow tag
[1:06:56] for muzzleloader
[1:07:00] and uh and boy that is just something
[1:07:01] that we just love to do
[1:07:03] yes i said we love going hunting
[1:07:06] um i know i see a lot of my brothers
[1:07:08] back there
[1:07:11] i love hunting as well
[1:07:16] and uh you know i just really felt i
[1:07:18] made the comment to several people
[1:07:20] uh different personas oh i'm coming back
[1:07:23] with meat either way
[1:07:26] bengali
[1:07:41] this this thought came to me
[1:07:44] something i'd been thinking about for a
[1:07:46] while but i just didn't really
[1:07:48] quite get it
[1:07:52] but i had a good friend with me a good
[1:07:54] guide brother henry um

[1:08:18] gracious but uh
[1:08:21] we were we had hunted pretty hard
[1:08:26] oh the action that we saw there's no
[1:08:29] reason why i don't have any meat
[1:08:31] at all but
[1:08:34] we every time we went out it was such a
[1:08:36] good time
[1:08:40] and uh we we finally got out you know i
[1:08:42] meant this
[1:08:43] and and and i finally got the shot that
[1:08:45] i needed
[1:08:49] it was it was a we came up on this
[1:08:52] this bull that had his head in the grass
[1:08:58] the wind was in our face the lord put
[1:09:01] this
[1:09:02] this beautiful animal right in
[1:09:11] and i was already thanking the lord for
[1:09:12] the meat
[1:09:15] and uh there was only one problem

[1:11:12] around and i see this great beast
[1:11:15] holding one arm up
[1:11:18] and crawling up on his other arm
[1:11:24] the last we saw him he hobbled off into
[1:11:26] the timberwolves
[1:11:31] by definition i hit the mark no i
[1:11:34] did exactly where i aimed
[1:11:37] but i knew in myself
[1:11:40] that was a bad decision i knew in myself
[1:11:45] even though i was able to justify it
[1:11:48] what i was doing and i had every reason
[1:11:51] and every backing
[1:11:52] to
[1:12:07] me where is we're looking we spent hours
[1:12:10] looking for him
[1:12:12] he a couple hours later
[1:12:15] we realized that he had he got harvested
[1:12:18] by somebody else
[1:12:22] but uh henry henry told me um brother
[1:12:24] anthony you'll just pray
[1:12:26] 100 anthony i believe that the lord will
[1:12:29] lead us to this help
[1:12:32] i believe he'll let let us see him
[1:13:02] that's
[1:13:15] so that's that's what the lord brought
[1:13:17] me to and thinking about iniquity
[1:13:19] yes the subject's not just deep it's a
[1:13:23] mystery
[1:13:26] a mystery is a scripture
[1:13:29] a previously hidden truth
[1:13:32] that is now divinely revealed
[1:13:36] but even though the mystery is revealed
[1:13:40] a supernatural element still remains
[1:14:12] the mystery of iniquity is one of the
[1:14:14] mysteries that the seventh angel's
[1:14:15] message it reveals
[1:14:22] brother branham tells us what iniquity
[1:14:26] is
[1:14:37] raise their hand and brother diego what
[1:14:40] is
[1:14:44] you know how to do good and not do it to
[1:14:47] know how to do good and not do it that
[1:14:49] is right
[1:14:51] that is what brother branham teaches
[1:14:52] he's located senior mana brandon to know
[1:14:54] how to do good and not do it
[1:14:57] brother branham says in the message
[1:14:59] behold greater than solomon is here
[1:15:03] he says iniquity is something that
[1:15:05] you're doing that you know you ought not
[1:15:07] to do
[1:15:21] iniquity is something that you know you
[1:15:23] ought not to do and still won't repent
[1:15:25] of it
[1:15:30] so we know the definition of definition
[1:15:33] it's a scripture that was previously
[1:15:35] hidden
[1:15:50] somebody might say well i'll stay with
[1:15:51] the revelation part of it
[1:15:55] the word says that the revelation is is
[1:15:57] god the word teaches that the revelation
[1:15:59] is one thing
[1:16:01] it is a part of it without without
[1:16:04] revelation without faith you cannot
[1:16:06] please god
[1:16:11] having the revelation without
[1:16:14] the supernatural elements
[1:16:18] paul said in first corinthians 1 13
[1:16:22] and though i have the gift of prophecy
[1:16:26] and i understand all mysteries and all
[1:16:30] knowledge and though i have all
[1:16:50] so and that paul summarizes all the
[1:16:52] mysteries right here
[1:16:53] pablo resume we could read this
[1:16:57] explain a little bit explicit make a
[1:16:59] little comment we'd be done
[1:17:16] in the end jesus warns us jesus
[1:17:20] and that opening scripture that we read
[1:17:23] that because iniquity shall abound
[1:17:28] the love
[1:17:54] when the bible speaks of the love
[1:18:13] it goes above any natural love or
[1:18:15] affection
[1:18:18] so agape love is supernatural
[1:18:22] so because iniquity shall abound is
[1:19:08] we confuse sin for iniquity
[1:19:12] they are very different different there
[1:19:14] are so many things we could go into on
[1:19:16] this yeah
[1:19:18] we gotta stick here with god's program
[1:19:19] but okay
[1:19:36] and the wages of sin is death
[1:19:40] the only way to be rid of sin
[1:19:44] is by the shedding of blood jesus said
[1:19:47] in matthew 26 28
[1:19:50] this is my blood of the new testament
[1:19:57] for the remission of sins now listen
[1:20:00] close
[1:20:02] you don't you
[1:20:15] or you hear filthy things
[1:20:43] who doesn't do any of those things but
[1:20:46] you've never but if you've never
[1:20:47] received the lord jesus christ
[1:20:51] as your savior salvador you're still
[1:20:53] just a sinner
[1:20:55] and sin is still your nature is
[1:21:12] that is the apostolic
[1:21:19] in the name of the lord jesus christ for
[1:21:22] the remission
[1:21:23] of sin and you shall receive the gift of
[1:21:28] the holy ghost
[1:21:31] that is the remedy it's your pardon from
[1:21:34] the wages of sin
[1:21:37] it's your escape from death jesus
[1:21:40] that's
[1:22:39] [Music]
[1:22:49] because we can do something about
[1:22:51] inequity
[1:22:55] requires work the blood of jesus christ
[1:23:00] it destroys the sin it remits the sin
[1:23:04] it
[1:23:16] sin cannot be exposed to the blood of
[1:23:19] the lord jesus christ
[1:23:23] and remain why because
[1:23:26] remission sends it back to the devil
[1:23:30] you don't hold that sin anymore
[1:24:14] is
[1:25:24] iniquity already existed
[1:25:29] we're going to read one of one of our
[1:25:30] elders one of the outstanding scriptures
[1:25:33] that he always teaches
[1:26:06] what did he cover get covered i don't
[1:26:07] know what it was he was covering
[1:26:10] and i have certified that was
[1:26:14] upon the holy mountain of god
[1:26:17] thou has walked up and down in the midst
[1:26:19] of the stones of fire i just
[1:26:57] we just leave it that he was cast to the
[1:26:59] earth
[1:27:01] down into the world it's easy to blame
[1:27:04] all the world's
[1:27:05] uh blame all the world for the world's
[1:27:08] problems
[1:27:11] easy to blame the world for our problems
[1:27:15] it's it's easy to see the world
[1:27:44] because you got to know what but james
[1:27:47] is talking about here
[1:27:50] my brethren be not many masters
[1:27:56] knowing that we shall receive the
[1:27:58] greater condemnation
[1:28:02] for in many things we offend all
[1:28:08] if any man offend not in the world
[1:28:11] the same is a perfect man
[1:28:40] that you can be
[1:29:36] even so
[1:29:46] how great a matter a little fire
[1:29:49] kindleth
[1:29:50] juan grande
[1:30:05] fire a language a world
[1:30:08] of iniquity there's an entire
[1:30:11] world that can live on your little
[1:30:18] members
[1:30:20] so is the tongue among our members
[1:30:25] defile it the whole body it contaminates
[1:30:28] and set it on fire
[1:30:29] the course of nature inflammatory
[1:30:32] and it is set on fire of health
[1:30:38] my goodness feels me did you know what
[1:30:40] you got inside here
[1:30:46] your life jacket's on
[1:30:49] listen close now we work hard for
[1:30:52] iniquity
[1:30:55] iniquity is a fight
[1:30:58] it's a struggle we've heard our prophet
[1:31:01] teach that you can be baptized with the
[1:31:03] holy ghost 24 hours a day
[1:31:09] and still go to hell why
[1:31:12] because hell is a battle a battle that
[1:31:14] you fight
[1:31:19] we're going to say that again hell is
[1:31:22] the battle
[1:31:23] that you fight and you win
[1:31:27] you have to fight past the cross
[1:31:56] iniquity takes effort
[1:31:59] iniquity resulted in war in heaven
[1:32:04] we know this now we've already
[1:32:07] established
[1:32:08] establishments and all the filthy things
[1:32:10] that we can think
[1:32:21] want you to pay attention to this next
[1:32:23] part we go into
[1:32:38] take advantage
[1:33:34] i believe that we are living in the last
[1:33:36] days
[1:33:38] i believe that we are living at the end
[1:33:40] time
[1:33:42] i can't even imagine how the world could
[1:33:44] get any worse
[1:33:47] we are at the end time brothers and
[1:33:48] sisters
[1:34:18] this like i said this is this is where
[1:34:21] the road meets the rubber here
[1:34:25] how does guppy love get cold combos
[1:34:30] this is where it counts this is the
[1:34:33] supernatural element
[1:34:36] this is a supernatural element
[1:34:39] that each one of us in our lives
[1:34:43] we gotta take control of what we're
[1:34:45] doing
[1:34:47] we've got to take control of what we're
[1:34:48] saying
[1:34:50] take control of how we think
[1:34:53] having the holy ghost is having control
[1:34:55] of the situation
[1:35:13] do you have things in you in your life
[1:35:15] that you have to defend
[1:35:19] do you say or do things in your life
[1:35:23] that you have to
[1:35:23] justify
[1:35:41] let the holy spirit get into the word
[1:35:42] this morning
[1:35:44] permit him to do an inspection
[1:35:48] i'm going to repeat the last line so
[1:35:50] it'll last couple lines so they'll sink
[1:35:52] in
[1:35:54] ask do i do or say
[1:35:58] things in my life that i have to defend
[1:36:01] for my conscience sake
[1:36:02] ago
[1:36:06] again we're not talking about the
[1:36:08] low-hanging fruit attributes of sin
[1:36:14] dig in deeper into your heart
[1:36:18] you might say brother i have no idea
[1:36:20] what you're talking about
[1:36:23] you might say i don't have to justify or
[1:36:25] defend anything that i do or say
[1:36:29] by by saying that
[1:36:33] you're justifying in just about
[1:36:35] everything you say and do in your life
[1:36:40] and i'll say this your little member
[1:36:44] probably on hellfire right now
[1:36:49] defending or regarding something
[1:36:53] that you know you ought not to do takes
[1:36:55] work
[1:36:58] it takes effort we become really good
[1:37:04] become experts
[1:37:18] we become believers
[1:37:33] we can justify them and it's just like
[1:37:35] if we didn't even do it
[1:37:38] that's inequity that's a characteristic
[1:37:41] of this dark age that we live in a
[1:37:43] characteristic
[1:38:04] give a little example of this
[1:38:08] you know where are you going to be one
[1:38:10] of these days
[1:38:12] there was a story or a dream that a
[1:38:15] brother gave brother branham one time
[1:38:18] he was a minister i believe it was
[1:38:22] and uh he dreamed that he went before
[1:38:24] the great white throne
[1:38:28] he had been
[1:38:44] he really felt he was in good shape
[1:38:47] and he thought he was okay
[1:38:51] and there and there was a great light
[1:38:52] that came from the great white throne
[1:38:56] and it said
[1:39:45] and i saw all the things that i had done
[1:39:48] in my life
[1:39:51] because in his presence
[1:40:48] him would you have a representative
[1:40:53] there
[1:40:57] my goodness
[1:41:01] you can't defend puerto rico
[1:41:14] if you reject christ as your savior
[1:41:44] there are things in our lives that we
[1:41:47] know we are not adu
[1:41:50] but we regard them it's wrong
[1:41:55] it causes the love of god the wax called
[1:41:58] you
[1:42:12] vida you might do great and charitable
[1:42:16] works
[1:42:19] many times we do a lot of things
[1:42:23] for our own conscience we use the works
[1:42:54] put
[1:43:07] but what does regarding iniquity do
[1:43:11] it important to those that come in
[1:43:13] contact with you
[1:43:16] let's go back to sin for a second
[1:43:19] sin is just your problem picado is
[1:43:37] you can't have anybody else except your
[1:43:40] pardon foreign because
[1:43:43] you're only responsible
[1:43:46] for what your sin is
[1:44:05] chapter 12. this one
[1:44:09] who first regarded iniquity
[1:44:12] importance
[1:44:17] we know him as lucifer
[1:44:32] or his
[1:44:45] [Music]
[1:44:47] what does regarding iniquity in your
[1:44:48] life do to your neighbor
[1:44:53] or to your brother or sister
[1:44:56] what is it what is your regarding as a
[1:44:58] young person do to your parents
[1:45:01] what does it do to your children if you
[1:45:04] were regarding iniquity in your life
[1:45:08] how about those that you work with
[1:45:12] those that you work for okay about those
[1:45:14] that work for you
[1:45:16] how does this iniquity in your life
[1:45:17] affect them
[1:45:20] again jesus said because
[1:45:23] iniquity
[1:45:27] shall wax
[1:46:17] how can you have a fire and ice in the
[1:46:20] same elements
[1:46:23] doesn't make much sense does it not
[1:47:46] i hope this is going not just up on the
[1:47:48] on the
[1:48:02] i'm not advocating
[1:48:28] what's going on way down deep in my
[1:48:30] heart
[1:48:33] what's going on way down deep in my mind
[1:48:36] what's going on down there that's what i
[1:48:39] need that's what we need to pay
[1:48:40] attention
[1:48:45] jesus said in matthew 7 22 jesus
[1:48:49] entering works many will say unto me
[1:48:55] we have done many wonderful works in
[1:48:57] your name
[1:49:02] [Music]
[1:49:10] we have to work on
[1:49:14] those folks are surprised at the lord's
[1:49:16] response
[1:49:20] imagine living your entire life
[1:49:23] doing wonderful works in the name of the
[1:49:26] lord senior and somehow
[1:49:30] because of iniquity in my life
[1:49:33] someone was pushed away from the love of
[1:49:35] god
[1:49:39] lord help me today
[1:49:50] anybody want to say what his will is
[1:49:52] does anybody know
[1:50:01] exactly right that no one would perish
[1:50:04] his will is that none would be lost
[1:50:09] wow i know you're getting maybe a little
[1:50:12] tired i know this is a little heavy
[1:50:15] we're almost done here his will is that
[1:50:18] none would be lost
[1:50:21] how that puts things in our perspective
[1:50:28] how should we conduct ourselves
[1:50:32] his wills that none would be lost
[1:50:36] if you're of him you do his will
[1:50:39] so that means that every single soul is
[1:50:41] a significant
[1:50:43] that we come in contact with
[1:50:47] their they become our responsibility
[1:51:03] there's so much can be said on this
[1:51:05] subject
[1:51:07] but you know if if we just take note of
[1:51:09] this
[1:51:11] there's enough of what we've covered
[1:51:13] this morning
[1:51:16] that can change the world it can
[1:51:32] if any man offends not in word
[1:51:37] the same as a perfect man and able also
[1:51:41] to bridle the whole body
[1:51:44] what would happen this morning
[1:52:00] what if one person in here did that
[1:52:02] today guess you're a person
[1:52:03] if one person would leave this place
[1:52:09] that's what i want to do i want the will
[1:52:11] of god
[1:52:13] what would happen if one person in this
[1:52:16] church
[1:52:18] would have compassion on every single
[1:52:20] person
[1:52:22] persona that they make contact with
[1:52:26] that's a challenge this morning to bring
[1:52:29] every single person
[1:52:31] that we come in contact with into the
[1:52:35] warmth of god's love
[1:52:37] can it be done by god's grace
[1:52:41] it is possible we can do all
[1:53:04] this is a quote from brother branham
[1:53:08] it tells us of the severity
[1:53:23] but if i regard iniquity in my heart
[1:53:27] then god will not hear my prayers
[1:53:32] wow
[1:53:37] can you imagine we think that god he
[1:53:41] sees and hears all things
[1:53:47] what a mystery give me studio but if i
[1:53:49] regard
[1:53:50] iniquity if i regard
[1:54:02] is something that you know that you're
[1:54:04] that you're doing
[1:54:35] and then look what he says you look what
[1:54:37] you say that's right brother ministers
[1:54:39] is correct it's true
[1:54:48] elijah if you just play

[1:55:36] word today
