we pray jesus [Music] amen amen you may be seated this time we have these specials our our sunday school children and then our brother and jillian hill has a poem yeah john 1 1 in the beginning was the word and the word was with god and the word was god god want one johnny 1 4 in john 1 6 and 7. there was a manchester from god his name was john and the same came through and his development of the light [Music] like john 1 9. that was the true light that lights every man that comes into the world is [Music] is [Applause] [Music] [Applause] i'm just gonna steal this one i think uh it appears there's a lot of john's tonight i thought that was interesting just wanted to point it out love that from the sunday school kids but to those of you who know my pen name for the books that i publish and write is actually john anderson um a pen name is just a name that you use when you don't want crazy people to follow you and stalk you for the rest of your life if you happen to get to that point as an author so i just thought that was an interesting uh thing but hello everybody it is wonderful to see you all again my beautiful extended family so good to be back and i got inspired to read this poem today um just out of the blue and i wanted to give some backstory about it because the back stories about how the poems are inspired are pretty interesting about two years ago maybe two and a half years ago i went out to lordsburg which is in the middle of nowhere and that's really all there is to say about it and i got to meet a cousin of mine his name was cousin mike cousin mike is a gentleman who literally lives out in the middle of nowhere of the middle of nowhere he is a man who lives in a i guess you call it an rv and um i don't know how he survived because in the entirety of the time i was there i saw him drink a coca-cola and that was it so he's a very interesting guy but the weird uh not the weird but the interesting thing about him was he's a man who collects rocks he is a man who has basically made his hobby and his living off of going to riverbeds and finding rocks now the interesting thing about cousin mike is that he collects rocks that you and i would probably not even know had anything beautiful inside them and i got to partake in this event of finding rocks and uh seeing him actually shape them into what we call fluoride if you've ever seen fluoride it's a wonderful beautiful greenish kind of teal color and it's very nice to look at but if you saw the rock that it was shaped from you would not think that at all you would you would think it's just a rock and so when i went on this trip and i saw him use all the tools and the things that he used to grind the rock down it inspired me with this poem uh that is titled poem 32. it's it's uh in this book here and i'm going to read it all to you and uh i hope you enjoy it an alternative title if you're interested is also the river man um the river man is my cousin mike so river man river man shaper of the rocks seeing what's within these rocks of little talks a raggedy pebble mixed with gunk and rubble builds great beauty in size and with trouble beauty tests inside the minerals of fluoride though that would not be seen upon seeing the outside it is dirty rough and a heavy burden to clean but the riverman cleanses it no matter how mean cutting off the gunk and polishing the stone working the beauty it would not work alone the riverman watches tending to each stone with care understanding its makeup and what makes it fair in uic gold fluoride and silver are all good attributes of value to deliver it's hard to know all the treasures inside the beautiful makeup that we ourselves do hide but the river man knows he is quite witty he knows how we sparkle and shines so pretty washed in the water and forged in blood carried out of darkness rubble and mud we are the rocks the river man takes made of clay and dirt precious metals and shapes beauty within is so hard to find if one tries it solo with no tools to grind no water to clean no diamond to graze no tools to chip all our filth in all ways river man river man how we need you still to show us and make us the beauty you instill god bless you [Applause] amen god god bless the children of the julian thank you for that [Music] is [Music] is [Music] is [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] and as we sing this again we're going to welcome the ministers this evening first we're going to have our brother jerry gonzalez followed by our our brother ronnie gonzalez have you come prepared are you ready to receive from him and let's sing it with all our hearts [Music] 15. [Music] [Applause] is is [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] oh [Music] [Music] amen amen god bless you tonight good to see you each and every one of your faces [Music] it's good to be in the house of the lord and let's see just to get uh get started right away so let's turn to our scriptures in acts uh 748 foreign okay and it reads i'll be at the most high dwelleth not in temples made with hands as saith the prophet templar [Music] [Music] thus saith the lord the heaven is my throne and earth is my footstool and i want to focus here on the second part where is the house that you build unto me and where is the place of my restaurant [Music] give thanks to the lord for the having confidence in us through our pastor to voice the word of god to you all the [Music] because every [Music] so we want to pray for our pastor and those that are that are traveling with him i know they're having a rough time getting out apparently they just [Music] and as i was driving a few days ago and it was the word development if you see my my title it's structure dash development [Music] so doing what i do you know i like to break down words and i [Music] [Music] and it came to the point where my training is [Music] so we have to do annual training on certain things right they give you a good company will always train it's a boy it keeps them educated in certain things [Music] [Music] [Music] to keep so you say brother jerry we're not in training no more we're in the battle they say that's true but even more so we have to be in training [Music] you have to keep up with the time because if we don't keep up with the time outdated very rapidly and an outdated person because it's hard when you don't know what you don't know so we know the cyber security is running rampant today but so so just let's just um talk about development here really quick let's define it really quick i know everybody knows what it for example like a project that's in development for example attractive land that has been made available or usable unapart [Music] in other words other words that mean development significant it went to evolution went to expansion expansion went to growth and progression so it started to make it started to come together a little bit like i said in my in my simple mind and how important it is for us to be developed keep in mind as i speak on things on the natural the puerto [Music] so it brought me to the message i was hearing when i when i heard development it took me to the message many of you have heard it the dark room so just bear with me really quick so but so in in the training when i was i work in training i thought about i thought about this this was what stuck to me it's an opportunity for professional development it's an opportunity remember that's what companies do to keep their employees up today it kind of reminds me of the rehearsal because we hear about transfiguration how it was a rehearsal right like like a training it took me to like i said mount transfiguration what it says here first timothy 3 16 i'm just going to paraphrase it okay [Music] because all scripture is given by inspiration of god and is profitable for doctrine so then again like i said i see in the scriptures that there's a certain structure that needs to be followed because there is an order to his coming did not moses see in heaven the way the tabernacle was patterned so he saw there was a certain development that's another message that our founding pastor preaches so we're gonna we're gonna find out here the synonyms to structure the synonymous destructura building the official and a word called edifice means a cathedral because you see how they kind of go hand in hand the structure is so the angle that i want to hit the structure now because we're going to find out because i'm only going to go about about five minutes but so the the angle that i want to hit on structure we're going to find out why the firefall ministry is so important why is it that they throw at it so much today what are they afraid of it says so god's saying that that a temple is not built by the hands of man [Music] there's something that's being built up [Applause] you're going to be all over the place i found in my routine my daily routine routine of the area many times i feel like i'm all over the place you know i'm like i'm gonna go to the gym i'm gonna i want to lose weight [Music] it's really no reality man builds a house right he's the one building the sanctuary but in reality it's god inspired men who built this if you [Applause] development what is the [Music] is is by the policies that are said [Music] here's an example of a development we say we love everyone but what happens when those words just become habitual so maybe back in the day when it first started it was enough to say i love you brother but what if it's not reinforced what if there's no training being done [Music] updated i it hits me before i even have the question so updated love in modern times updated updated for today to be able to to battle the devil today it requires updates requires exercise it requires training it requires [Music] for if you love them which love you what reward have you you're not even the publicans the same you get the gist of it you just read it through the through the screen there but he says watch this this without this structure there will never be a development that's why there's so many interpretations of the message of the bible it requires a man to build a house he's asking what house will you build which most words ending in a-r-i-e-m a container for keeping something in content in this case holy or perhaps cherished people in this case and he gave some apostles prophets and some evangelists and some pastors and teachers there's the structure watch this for the perfecting of the saints for the work of the ministry for the edifying there's no way we're going to be able to get to this without going through that structure that we henceforth be no more children developed no longer developing [Music] is it's right after the structure he applies the structure and you notice how everything the development comes afterwards that's why it's so essential it's important [Music] listen to him [Music] [Music] and that way we can be developed [Applause] jerry that's what i haven't heard in a while [Music] [Music] i'm gonna be reading our first scripture here it's gonna be found in second corinthians chapter five verse 17. cinco now this bible that i'm preaching is my interpretation bible here [Music] so i have a interpretation bible and a preaching bible but as i was getting my preaching bible to come to church when i had second corinthians 5 17. it wasn't even the right scripture i told my wife i was like what the heck is this yeah it goes from i'm going to read from 17 to 21. it just goes from 17 and 18. and it's not even the right scripture [Music] therefore if any man be in christ he is a new creature all things are passed away behold all things are become new and all and all things are of god who have reconciled us to himself by jesus christ and have given to us the ministry of reconciliation reconciliation [Music] to wit that god was in christ reconciling the world unto himself not imputing their trespasses unto them and have committed unto us the word of reconciliation 17 10. and it says i the lord search the heart i try the reins even to give every man according to his ways and according to the fruit of his doing [Music] hey man all righty i'm gonna do something a little bit different here i know i know normally they say when they ask a question they say not to look around but humor me this evening okay how many are ambassadors for christ raise your hands keep your hands up now look around look at all your brothers look at all the ambassadors of christ [Music] amen how many believe that they're part of the bride of the lord jesus christ raise your hand keep your hand up now look around look at all look at all this this portion of the bride of christ how many are part of the body the mystical body of the lord jesus christ raise your hands good to see you welcome back you saw all part of the mystical body of the lord jesus christ when he had the holy ghost look around look at look at all the brothers that have the holy ghost [Music] look at all the gifts here and here sitting down how many believe what you're saying there's a lot of believers here now look around look at all the believers here that are sitting down amen thank you very much thank you for participating and i promise you it's not just to see to be nosy who has it who doesn't know but it's for a purpose okay amen we speaking of gifts and yield it use it for the lord jesus christ amen not only the youth but the adults because you also have a gift we we uh adults the older adults you're you're an example to the younger ones so here today i'm going to train a subject i've never really entered into before and it's on reconciliation reconciliation amen and um so i guess i kind of started been studying on that for a little bit then i started getting into redemption a little bit concentrated and i can say what brother branham says i'm not going to repeat what brother branham says but i'm trying to say what brother location for those that don't know there's a big difference and i'm going to say what he said the plan of redemption oh what a plan what a plan a plan i i i i can i want to say to everyone if you've never studied the redemption the plan of redemption i i do it and look into it you'll be blessed [Music] sorry guys i forgot to give it to you [Music] redeem means to recover recover it's like if you have something in the pawn shop right and you want to take it out you go and you purchase it back to make amends to recover from captivity to set free from slavery all right now we're going to read uh the definition of reconcile [Music] and this is here we're going to do the best we can to to focus on reconcile to restore to friendship or harmony harmony that's that's the key word there harmony to settle or to resolve now here's another question you don't have to raise your hands on this one you know you know you search your heart does somebody have something against you does one of the youth does somebody have something against you know do you have something against each other oh this brother here oh he did me wrong so this so this subject here you know we i i i was in in the subject here and during this time when the lord gave me this this uh this subject this theme here [Music] and during you know after we had listened to it my thoughts were on that and then and then we start hearing all that russia's gonna start to invade right you know so then my thoughts go from reconciliation to the prophecies of russia and all these other things oh and how it talks about the three curtains the iron curtain the bamboo curtain the the the purple curtain brother branham says don't for don't fear the iron curtain or the bamboo curtain of the bamboo hear that purple kern so i was like i was like lord how did how did i go from reconciliation to this and uh and then then he began to tie it in for me you know and i i began to think to myself and i and i thought lord why why is it so hard for people to be reconciled with each other i'm sorry why is it so hard for people to be reconciled why is this so hard for people to simply make something right and i had that question to notice myself [Music] you know i'm not going to stand here in front of everybody and stay here that i'm here and i'm perfect you know you know but i i had the pride you know pride gets in the way of so many people so many uh people of in the church we began to get a little bit a little prideful right oh i do this in the church you walk with me i get here the earliest yo yo oh i'm the last one to leave i say amen the loudest must i can't point the finger to nobody else how hard it is for someone to that is prideful to simply humble themselves and make a thing right so the lord began to work with me now he says he says ronnie what's iron this eradicates i start to think you know in my simple mind oh iron is something hard you get a piece of iron it you can't bend it it's hard to bend and he says oh pride is like iron. and i it was at that moment right there when he told me that it was at that moment i realized that every single one of us or some time in the past all three curtains inside of us the iron oh i do this in the church i can't humble myself to to to apologize to jerry yes you know uh jerry i don't i didn't do anything wrong i do this in the church one in the church always justifying ourselves brother branham here and the message thinking on our way we are thinking about our justifying ourselves all the time right i'm gonna read this as quick as i can here and and when i come back in a few minutes my precious wife standing in the door she looked she looked and i know what she meant when her eyes caught mine now this story is when brother branham was got into trouble with the taxes story is [Music] they call right they call and he goes outside she said billy was that just exactly right you know how you like to justify yourself sometimes i said oh sure you'll see i wasn't in there she said but you was when the phone rang i said but i wasn't in here when you when you told them [Music] i said that was all right she said billy billy are you sure of that oh i i i said i think so and i started out and i got my [Music] [Music] can you lay your hands on that child the bible says in first john 3 21. if our heart condemned us then we have confidence with god that's what's the matter with the christian church christiana can't get anything done because our hearts that's the way to be truthful and i started i started to pray and i seen i wasn't fit to put my hands on that baby i said sir sir i will i will see i will see that your appointment is held just stay here i rushed to the phone and called the attorney i said can i speak to you a minute he said sure you'll see but the other fellows are done i said just stay in your office a few minutes i rushed down there i went to the room i said attorney [Music] [Music] i said i wasn't here but i run out of the house and run behind the house to keep from being in there i said it's a lie anyhow i said will you forgive me forever [Music] and i could see in his gray gray eyes little tears began to form [Music] so just follow me okay that iron kern is like pride the second turn bamboo the bamboo red china and as i began to think on that the lord comes and it strikes me again he says ronnie is it ronnie what is china known for i asked the sister the other day what is china known for the china egg rolls um chinese food yeah i just sorry i had to throw that in there and china is well known for a great landmark that's there china because we're not willing to humble ourselves to make it right i don't care who we think we are i don't care if you're a preacher the wife of the preacher a child of a preacher we all have walls we talk a lot about the statue of a perfect man we go from justification sanctification of the holy ghost and then our founding pastor would always say then you cross jordan and brother jerry brought something to my attention he says he says before before they entered into canaan which is a type of the promised land the type what is the moon what's the moon here's la luna the moon is the church and great walls that we built and that's why the body of the lord jesus christ is the sickest body the walls that we have built up this brother can't get along this brother he said something about me 20 years ago oh his brother he said something he said something that that offended my family 50 years ago how could we enter that pyramid how could they have gone to canaan without without first crossing jericho how can we get into that statue of a perfect man we want to climb it right it almost all these walls of separation but there are great walls that we have built up and these [Music] [Music] the type of the holy ghost people in the spirit of santo we must break down the walls the walls that we have with our brothers you know we used to get along so good with so many people and now we don't you all are wrong but they have to come down we gotta tear them down the bamboo curtain or wall is thick in the church second curtain the walls that we've built up again each and every in each and every one of us what do they what do curtains do yes we all know that we have curtains in our house lions whatever you want to call [Music] he says hear that one walls that have been built up and where are they all hiding behind religion a religious spirit is the worst spirit he doesn't see though he doesn't say to fear the iron or the bamboo don't fear the pride or the walls that you're building up all these curtains they got to be ripped down sorry around my glasses i can't read the time how how how people are religious people yeah we can't even shake the hand of a people of somebody that used to come to church and we profess love we say that we love everybody but yet we see somebody that used to come to church and we see them at the store i i know because because i've talked to some of them you got to tell me that i'm wrong in that one but we love we love romamos before got so loved for we saw love in this message church i've never been searched so much in my life this message this message has has been the hardest message for me because when the holy spirit began to to to to uh to show me these things [Music] on reconciliation names came up you're a minister but you're not reconciled [Music] but lord or lord but but god was in christ reconciling the world to himself lord i'm reconciled it says oh no this is where i get the essence of my message right here matthew 5 22 matteo cinco but i say unto you that whosoever is angry with his brother without a cause are you angry with your brother i'll tell you what church when the holy spirit becomes comes and be and searches the reins of the heart no matter how much you try to justify yourself absolutely no hiding from oh and whosoever shall say to his brother raqqa shall be in danger of the council but whosoever shall say thou full shall be in danger of hellfire [Music] all right so so now here comes the part where you raise your hand remember we raised our hands we all looked around now here we're here here comes the kicker now odd against you leave your gift at the altar go that way first be reconciled god was it christ reconciling the world to himself and we're happy with that he redeemed us and reconciliation goes right with redemption oh you got it we're wrecked out to um therefore bring thy gift to the altar oh youth holiness you're trying to steer the gift for the inside of him well then but the altar oh we think oh brother i'm going to come up to the altar and i'm going to cry my eyes out that's not the altar he's talking about not only the altar right here we're going to offer your gift make it right with your brothers and this is this is a kicker right here this is the kicker for me this is what the holy ghost made me do i had to make it right at work also for something i and i had to apologize for helping my family i didn't even do nothing wrong i had to go and make it right at work and there and i hadn't seen this gentleman in about three years [Music] so thursday and lo and behold here he comes [Music] i pushed my car to the side i asked his girlfriend if he could give me a minute with her with him and i told him you know what man i go this this and this situation happened i've been hoping to run into you you know you've been on my heart and this whole time this and i told my you know i'm sorry you've been in my heart i know i wanted to make things right with you man i'm sorry you see brother ronnie that's not a good example it's just brother ronnie you know i said it i remember what i remember one time if you remember this he says there was a brother a cab driver he says for some reason he just did not like me every time i would go to mexico mexico you know you would give me you give me a bad face and he said so i purposed on my heart before i went and i went and and won the brother over [Music] [Music] i'm sorry i didn't get a chance to finish no no no uh it's a small things play something soft the simple things the small things are simple that'll keep us from entering in because thou has despised the deus model how to treat a brother right something soft for us brother i'm gonna just jump to the conclusion here um jump to this [Music] like this like this my spiritual senses are heightened he says i know what the voice meant it was saying to make things right in our lives but what i felt beyond strong was make things right with your brothers or you will not be able to see your loved ones you know we say a lot of times i'm gonna wait for the brother to come to me i mean the scripture don't say that go make it right with your brother it says but if you know that a brother has something against [Music] raise your hands because nothing short of perfection will enter into perfection don't let the sun set on your wrath the sun sets on too many people's lives in other words don't die with habit having somebody having something against somebody [Music] or somebody having something against you [Music] like brother branham said unleashing the matter brandon how the man told [Music] before god bless you [Applause] would you please stand [Music] close your eyes you need to make something right with your brother with the lord you heard the word of the lord search me o god [Music] today [Music] i know my god [Music] me me [Music] me [Music] me [Music] the world [Applause] and make me [Music] [Music] this day [Music] [Applause] [Music] lord take my life lord [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] with [Music] [Applause] [Music] my you surrender [Music] [Music] me [Music] god [Music] [Music] is [Music]
