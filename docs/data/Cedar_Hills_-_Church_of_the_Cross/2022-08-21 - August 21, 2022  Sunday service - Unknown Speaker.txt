this morning and to be able to speak to the purchase of that precious blood of the lord and we have a little subject that's going to be fairly simple this morning but what makes it profound is when you understand what he says amen you got it up there for me guys alakaya four very well i'll go ahead and start reading it very familiar scripture and we're going to hit it maybe from a little different angle this morning the title of our message is realizing your potential behold i will send you elijah the prophet before the coming of the great and dreadful day of the lord granted and he shall turn the heart singular of the fathers to the children and the heart singular of the children to their fathers lest they come and smite the earth with a curse john 5 excuse me they say 2 it's john 5 juan okay capitulosinko me get it here how many love the lord this morning el senor and esta manana how many came to learn this morning i know i have yo father judgeth no man but he had committed all judgment unto the son that all men should honor the son even as they honor the father he that honoreth this not the son on earth not the father which have sinned verily verily i say unto you he that heareth my word and believeth on him that sent me hath everlasting life and shall not come into the condemnation but has passed from death lord jesus we just thank you this morning for your word lord jesus it's such a privilege to come and honor your resurrection resurrection as your prophet said but lord it's not the day so much but it's that you rose from the dead lord and you presented yourself alive to us and we're just such a privileged people senor somos we commit ourselves into your hands here in the pulpit and in the audience in the name of the lord jesus christ amen amen you may be seated amen i'd like to give the definition of the word how many of you would like to reach your potential potential how many know what your potential is potential how many know what god thinks your potential and is takes me to this word that the lord took me to this word potential potential and it simply says existing and possibility is implemented existing impossibility this potential exists it's right there in the possibility estee potential existed but if it stays in that stage you never realize that potential what it is something very simple and it says capable of development into actuality and something real algorithm it's it's it's a potential you you have the capability to be developed into something so precious before the lord de certain and this takes me to another word yes we're not going to hit this this morning no hablaremos esto en esta manana but the word unveiling when you come to what your potential is potential and it comes forth or you realize it unveil to remove a veil or covering from to make public to divulge to make known something such as a confidence i said you must find out what god has confidence in tiene que la secuenta en que dios tiene confienza how many want god to have confidence in you amen amen amen and you might ask well why did you start with malachi 4 5 and 6. and if you all could put up that first quote for me out of christ the mystery of god revealed amen if they can get it if not i'll get it here in the present when that is you know amen praise the lord well there it is it's not up here okay that's fine i've got it paragraph 330 how many believe malachi 4 5 and 6. that's a ridiculous question brother jimmy hermano well well brother branham fulfilled malachi 4 5 and 6. to turn the heart of the jewish fathers to the children of the kingdom but can we see what it means to us as the bride but how many believe that elijah himself brother brenna juantos mismo el hermano or converted or converted back to the original faith of the apostolic fathers that he was the prophet and it was just push button and he was he was already in that stature no first the spirit of elijah and him had to restore him first he had to see where the apostolic faith was in his day in sudhir amen amen many say well yeah just the apostles of the bible but brother branham urbano ben instead either why if there ever was an apostle to the pentecostal people it was at that password where buzzword well there was controversy and they wanted to to argue with brother brenham about doctrine brother venom didn't like that he would shy away from that and that's where it would say let me add them to me let me have it yeah that halos on me and then and then brother said promise me you're not going to argue with them thank you brother gracias why because that was his ministry that now these apostolic fathers apostolics would have to pour out the faith they had dendrian upon the children and we're going to be talking a lot about what a father is and what a child is yeah what immaturity is and what maturity is i wanted to give you that just a little preview of that before we read this quote out of christ the mystery of god revealed but then god said in the last days he would bring out a people washed in his blood and they were predestinated to be there yesterday let's turn around and tell your neighbor i've got to be here okay amen i'm in let's keep going i will malachi 4 what would he do restore back again bring back in the last days these great things yes what'd he do was to bring back the faith of the fathers to the children amen so malachi of four five and six is compound it's not just talking about the dispensations it's talking about a condition yeah i want to pour it out on the children bring it to the children see that's right to bring back the same thing right the same pillar of fire that column on the scene in listen the same signs sing wonders name jesus making him the same hacienda hacienda preaching him the same foreign [Applause] in this ministry that god has given us the privilege to participate and now our pastor now yeah now i want you to notice something here when i give the definition of the word divulge it said to make known something such as a confidence or a secret seral what's the most important secret to you what is who am i when you find out what god has confidence in us then the secret of your potential will come forth potential how many believe that god has confidence in this well he's not even handsome anymore he's getting uglier every day when i look in the mirror he don't have confidence in this but there's something he has confidence in bro now i want to go back and continue reading that quote this will be we'll try not to read too much already 20 25 minutes go by i will restore said the lord all the years that the methodist worm the caterpillar worm and the baptist and the catholic yo restaurant watch this we can all say oh yeah that that's uh joel 1 and 2. but watch this watch this statement and the catholic los catolicos cama coma and all them worms eat that faith down where did those worms come from he's talking about the spirit of denominationalism and what is the problem today amongst our ranks i shared this with brother hector many many years ago people hear the message they come out of denominations or they come out of but egypt or denomination never comes out of them so i don't believe people do it on purpose most of the time i don't believe that when i did it at first i did it on purpose i did it but i was just a little baptist boy that's all i knew that was my make-up so when i heard the message of the hour something so distinct and that little voice down in the soul saying this is the truth amen amen so watch this in the foreknowledge of god and el preco no simento de dios do you believe creole's death that god knew sabia in general in general what man was going to do with this message from the year of 1965 delano to the year of 2022 helano dos milbentidos that another denomination it cannot produce the estimate received the revelation of jesus christ and they grew up from being children decreasing they became fathers could be given to the next generation is we're not going to go into what i've said about it before yes but it simply means significant to transmit it uh transmitted it can't just be in written form no dramatized means that it's active and it's alive in the process of when it's being to turn the heart of the fathers to the children wasn't just speaking of the jewish followers it was speaking about the apostolic fathers de you know i i never heard brother tommy ever say that he was an apostle he said you're getting personal now yes this is personal hermanos my personality is personal he is my happy he's he makes me happy well i'm just so glad god brought me under this ministry i never heard brother tommy say don't have to go around saying i'm this i'm i am an apostle of jesus christ what did he say at that stage of his ministry because god had already proved his election he was only confessing what god had already vindicated that when can you and i as children of god when though message what this potential is is the potential i believe it's going to be a blessing to you because it's much more beyond could you bring me this chair and put it right here i'm afraid i'd like to illustrate this and boy i love seeing all these notebooks and guys oh my god who's one of the smaller the guys baroness well you're small enough that nobody else got it up okay i want you to sit right here as we read mark 9. amen amen jesus is going to show us these stages jesus and he sat down and called the twelve and said unto them if any man desire to be first the same shall be last of all and the servants alone entonces served [Music] he's sitting here right but jesus just didn't sit him there to sit in there he placed him there to show how this kingdom started with a child four five stars to turn the heart of the fathers is that simple enough okay but watch what happens next then he says whosoever receiveth one of such children my name just in is name this is not just a child of somebody around the world or just anybody this is somebody that's a child that is marked by his name such children in my name receiveth me receive whosoever shall receive me receive is not me no matter him that sent me what was he doing he was becoming one with that child he was seeing himself in that child there his disciples were looking at him and he put a child there because he could see himself in the stage of a child thank you did you get that look up though oh he's showing us from the beginning how he was going to develop amen amen time is going fast amen now let's go to another scripture then amen are you with me estan conmigo and this is malakai four five and six this is in kindergarten at the same time amen praise the lord jesus now let's go to john 12. now i'm gonna expect to start going a and we're going to start with verse 44 jesus christ and said jesus he they believe it on me believeth not on me but on him that sent me in me what's this he that believed until things get rough oh okay because that child that jesus took up in his arms now he's going to see that child grow up to be a mature person persona to be a father of the because i'm no longer a child anymore i'm starting to grow up into what god said i would be esto my heart is being turned from a child turns solo sally amen how many want to realize your potential potential okay matthew matthew chen matteo yes are you with me so far are you are you getting it how many of us you'll see as a child now some of you must see us as a child because that's where we are in our spiritual group maybe we're brand new spanking brand new born again amen 39. and he that findeth his life shall lose it notice find it's all oh what can i do i want to do this why am i that was kind of a good expression the self-degeneration but i've seen some adults that do that a lot too so you got to be careful when you get right watch this and he then loses his life for my sake shall find it we've read these scriptures over and over and he that receiveth been fulfilled he said yes in the life and ministry of brother branham but has it been fulfilled in you completed unless i come and smite the earth starting with paragraph 90. now you go out here on the street and say to a prostitute that you believe uh paso to come to justification we need a justification which is the first part of the new birth not the new birth in itself his place in this hour you continue to know it continue it's your focus yeah well you're not just interested in your own personal [Music] amen amen he that heareth my word and believeth on him that sent me he created you present tense brother says come on young people then when the new eternal life dwells in you entonces it is the potential potential you want to know what your potential is potential he's just telling you here what your potential is being capable of being developed it is the potential or the earnest of you being quickened from mortal to immortality immortal that one made me dizzy that's too much for me let me say that again when the spirit has found you spiritually everybody says oh i'm up here out in the world and he goes and he finds me though that's not what he's talking about oh yeah he calls you from the world and has come up on you it's the potential of your eternal inheritance that god thought of you and made for you remember that definition i gave up of divulge that's what he's talking foreign let's skip to paragraph 95 so we do when you receive the holy spirit of god watch this that potential is already there is a potential leave it has found you spirited oh my god it's god's potential waiting upon you potentially esperando no maybe we're not the original and what are they doing is can recognize my goodness gets me it's already recognized have you recognized yourself in christ the mystery of god revealed again [Music] the complete revelation the revelation completely subtitled does that mean you have all the revelations no it's talking about a revelation that's gone through a complete process and we've read this quote too many many times but now let's lead in this life as this faith is this look christ in you makes him the center of life of the revolution revelation it's the place from where everything originates from which all movement begins that's why brother branham said in god's spoken word of the original seed [Music] he said the bride nicola she waits it's better she doesn't move hey he waits for just say of the lord now that doesn't mean that we're the prophet no significant prophet that means that she's sure okay yes that and she's already starting to go where she's going yeah amen i'm in i don't want to offend nobody i get a little crazy up here so if you have the new birthday see christ lives in you makes him [Music] [Applause] christ in the bible christ makes the bible the complete revelation of christ christ didn't make a new mystery
