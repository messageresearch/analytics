[0:00] now
[0:01] we notice now as we go into the sixth
[0:03] seal now may the heavenly father help us
[0:06] as we settle down now to this sixth seal
[0:10] now
[0:11] this twelfth verse of the sixth chapter
[0:15] and i beheld when he opened the sixth
[0:17] seal and lo there was a great earthquake
[0:20] and the sun became black as
[0:23] sackcloth of hair
[0:25] and the moon became his blood and the
[0:27] stars of heaven fell into earth even as
[0:30] a fig tree cast her untimely figs when
[0:33] she's shaken of a mighty wind
[0:36] and the heavens departed as a scroll
[0:39] when it's rolled together whenever a
[0:41] mountain every island were moved out of
[0:43] their places and the kings of the earth
[0:46] and the great man and the rich man
[0:48] and the chief captains and the mighty
[0:51] man and everybody and every free man
[0:53] hid themselves
[0:55] in the dens and in the rocks of the
[0:57] mountains
[0:58] and said to the mountains and rocks fall
[1:01] on us and hide us from the face of him
[1:03] that set up on the throne
[1:06] and from the wrath of the lamb
[1:09] for the great day of his wrath has come
[1:11] and who shall be able to stand
[1:15] if we find out now john said i'll be
[1:18] held when he opened the sixth seal that
[1:21] was a great earthquake
[1:23] then all
[1:24] nature was interrupted
[1:26] see but we find out here that nature
[1:30] took a tumble
[1:32] yes all nature look what taken place the
[1:35] the
[1:36] earthquake the sun went black and the
[1:39] moon would give its light the stars
[1:41] shook and fell and
[1:43] while everything happened
[1:46] see right at the time of the opening of
[1:49] this sixth seal
[1:50] that's when it takes place
[1:53] right immediately after the announcement
[1:56] of those
[1:57] martyrs okay
[1:59] the martyrs have been finished now you
[2:01] see we're right close into that hour now
[2:03] we could be at any time
[2:08] see because
[2:10] the church is just about ready to take
[2:12] its flight
[2:13] but remember when these things happen
[2:17] the bride won't be here
[2:20] just remember the bride's gone
[2:23] you don't have to go through any of it
[2:25] this is a time of tribulation of
[2:28] purification of the uh
[2:30] of the church
[2:32] it's put up honor for it go through it
[2:35] not the right he takes his sweetheart
[2:37] out of the way
[2:38] that's cersei done redeemed her
[2:42] see it's kind of a
[2:44] that's his own selection his own choice
[2:47] like any man that takes his bride
[2:50] now
[2:51] the earthquake compares scriptures of
[2:53] this great event
[2:55] that we will see
[2:57] that this great secret
[2:59] or
[3:01] uh mystery
[3:02] that was under the sixth seal of the
[3:06] book of redemption
[3:08] now remember
[3:09] these are hidden mysteries
[3:13] and the six seals all together is one
[3:16] great big book
[3:18] just six scrolls rolled together
[3:20] and it unwinds the whole book of
[3:22] redemption
[3:24] that's how the whole earth
[3:27] was redeemed that's reason john wept
[3:30] because of no one could get that book
[3:32] all creation everything was gone
[3:35] she just simply turned back to
[3:39] atoms and molecules and so forth and
[3:41] cosmic light and not even be creation
[3:44] person nothing else because
[3:46] adam
[3:47] lost the rights of that book he
[3:50] forfeited
[3:51] when he listened to his wife
[3:54] and she listened to satan's reasonings
[3:56] instead of the word of god
[3:59] he was farting then he couldn't go back
[4:01] into the dirty hands of satan who
[4:03] tempted her out of the way so
[4:05] therefore
[4:07] it went back to its original owner like
[4:09] any abstract deed would do see goes
[4:12] right back to its original owner and
[4:14] that was god the creator who made it
[4:17] and he holds it
[4:19] now
[4:21] here
[4:22] let's start out now and let's read uh
[4:24] saint matthew
[4:26] the 24th chapter now i just like to give
[4:29] you something here i've just looked up
[4:30] to find now saint matthew from
[4:34] one to three
[4:36] well it's where we go to read first
[4:38] and jesus went out and departed from the
[4:41] temple and his disciples came to him for
[4:44] to show him the building of the temple
[4:47] and he said unto them
[4:49] see not all these things verily i say
[4:51] unto you there shall not be one
[4:53] be left here one stone upon another that
[4:56] shall not be thrown down
[4:59] these three verses it took place
[5:02] actually on tuesday afternoon april the
[5:04] 4th 80 30.
[5:06] and the first two verses
[5:08] took place on the afternoon
[5:11] of the of april the 4th and 80 30 and
[5:15] the third verse taken place on tuesday
[5:18] evening of the same day
[5:20] see
[5:21] now notice here is here is three
[5:25] questions are asked by the jews his
[5:28] disciple three questions are asking why
[5:30] what um uh first first what
[5:35] when shall these things be when there
[5:37] won't be one stone left up on another
[5:39] what shall be the sign of thy coming
[5:42] second question
[5:43] and of the end of the world see it these
[5:46] three questions see just exactly
[5:49] comparing what jesus said in matthew 24
[5:52] and what the revelator here opened up in
[5:55] the sixth seal is just exactly and jesus
[5:58] was speaking of the tribulation period
[6:02] amen this sixth seal is the tribulation
[6:05] period that's what takes place
[6:08] the bride has gone
[6:12] there's no living creature nothing there
[6:14] to say it it's just now god is not
[6:16] dealing with the church no more it's
[6:17] been gone he's dealing with israel
[6:20] this is the other side
[6:22] this is when israel
[6:24] received
[6:25] the message of the kingdom
[6:27] by the two prophets of revelation 11.
[6:31] remember
[6:32] israel
[6:33] is
[6:34] a nation
[6:36] god's
[6:37] servant nation
[6:39] and when
[6:40] when
[6:42] when israel is brought in it'll be a
[6:46] national affair
[6:48] and
[6:50] that's when they're supposed to be
[6:51] delivered now look let's get to daniel
[6:53] 12 here just a minute
[6:56] and at that time
[6:58] michael shall stand up the great prince
[7:00] which stood for the children for
[7:03] or the children of thy people
[7:07] see
[7:08] that's jews
[7:10] and there shall be a trouble such never
[7:12] was since there was a nation even to
[7:14] that same time now compare that exactly
[7:17] what jesus said matthew 24.
[7:20] there should be a time of trouble has
[7:21] never been since there was a nation look
[7:24] at this sixth seal see the same thing a
[7:27] time of trouble
[7:28] notice since there wasn't even to the
[7:31] same time and at that time thy people
[7:35] now in this seven last part of the
[7:37] seventh year thy people shall be
[7:39] delivered every one that shall be found
[7:43] written
[7:44] in the book
[7:46] the predestinated you see that's written
[7:48] in the lamb's book of life shall be
[7:50] delivered at that time
[7:53] and many of those asleep in the dust the
[7:56] earth shall await
[7:58] and some to everlasting life and some of
[8:00] the evolution shame and contentment now
[8:03] and then shall the wise shine as the
[8:05] brightness of the firmaments and and
[8:08] they that turn many to righteous shall
[8:10] shine the stars forever and ever
[8:12] and i will give power unto my two
[8:14] witnesses that they shall prophesy a
[8:17] thousand two hundred and three score
[8:18] days clothed in sacral
[8:20] these are the two olive trees and the
[8:22] two candlesticks that stand before the
[8:24] god of the earth if any man hurt them
[8:26] fire proceedeth out of their mouth
[8:28] devour their enemies and if any man
[8:30] shall hurt them he must in this manner
[8:33] be killed see there it is they can speak
[8:36] what they want to and there it happens
[8:39] amen
[8:41] brother god rides on the scene here
[8:44] they have power
[8:46] uh power to shut the heavens that it
[8:49] rain not in the days of their prophecy
[8:51] and have power over the waters to turn
[8:53] them to blood and to smite the earth
[8:55] with plagues as off as they will
[8:59] what is it god can bring these things
[9:01] but the word
[9:03] they can
[9:04] do nature any way they want to here it
[9:07] is they're the one who brings on this
[9:09] sixth seal
[9:10] they uncover and open it up it's a power
[9:13] of god
[9:14] [Music]
[9:16] this interrupt nature
[9:19] see the sixth seal is completely an
[9:21] interruption of nature
[9:25] do you get it now
[9:27] there's your seal
[9:29] who doesn't it's the prophets
[9:31] the other side of the rapture
[9:33] and here he is with the commission from
[9:36] god to smite the earth whatever he wants
[9:38] to oh

[9:43] and he does what's the matter he's
[9:45] fixing to take the 144 thousand out for
