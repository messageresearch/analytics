[2:12] that's reason his borned out in a major
[2:15] labs are not born in beds he he was led
[2:18] to the Calvary that she pearl and that's
[2:21] why votes lead him to the slaughter you
[2:23] know that in slaughterhouse a goat leads
[2:25] him but they have to be led that's right
[2:28] so he was led to the slaughter see
[2:30] because he wasn't lamb everything
[2:32] identified him in nature that's the
[2:34] reason he was born in March or April not
[2:36] the December he couldn't be twenty foot
[2:38] of snow up there net Khatami here not o
[2:40] Sun God but he was a son of God the
[2:42] Roman Sun God on the 25th day of
[2:45] December when the solar passes its
[2:47] places in there and they had the Roman
[2:49] circuses and called the Sun God's
[2:51] birthday and then making the Son of God
[2:52] no no he was the son of God his birthday
[2:55] was for the rest of nature exactly
[2:57] now notice again now as we go on we got
[3:01] a little time man
[3:03] now to the perfect after the stock has
[3:06] been formed and if the Tasos been farmed
[3:09] after the green has come on to the cob
[3:12] then it has to come to perfection back
[3:15] to a regular green again and remember
[3:17] the grain must be German tines the if it
[3:22] don't it won't live see none of that was
[3:27] outside of them messages will ever
[3:30] hunga life let's be German ties remember
[3:33] the same life that was in the stock is
[3:35] in the green it's just maturing yourself
[3:38] right back seat he revealed he said what
[3:41] son of man the grain that went into the
[3:45] ground get the message the Greek said to
[3:49] him we would see Jesus he said except
[3:51] the grain of corn falls into the grave
[3:53] haha now what do you reveal yourself
[3:56] next in a different farm stall can
[3:59] tousle and so forth and all the leaves
[4:01] everything you reveal itself then one
[4:04] same spirit but in a different form
[4:07] think but what's the last of that car it
[4:11] comes back to the original green that
[4:13] Wright and his ministry comes from them
[4:16] Reclamation's back to the original word
[4:21] again the word comes to a prophet and he
[4:26] promised to the Malachi 4 and to restore
[4:28] the faith of the people back to the
[4:30] original dream but when in the ground is
[4:32] here the same the green is come up
[4:35] through here and come up his son of God
[4:36] now it reveals itself very son of man
[4:38] and then it reveals yourself as son of
[4:40] David on the throne see and three son in
[4:44] this exactly oh my again like the
[4:48] original now to the perfect ministry
[4:51] audience self not some and not some
[4:53] denomination as they've worked out
[4:54] through that age there see but he
[4:57] himself made manifest manifest himself
[5:00] to the promised making Saint Luke 17 28
[5:04] Malachi 4 and so forth Hebrews 13:8 just
[5:07] exactly right
[5:07] at that time what time should it be when
[5:11] the royal seat of Abraham is looking for
[5:15] the promised son and all types must be
[5:19] fulfilled and God Himself appeared in
[5:22] the form of a human being that Abraham's
[5:25] natural seed before the destruction and
[5:28] Jesus said it would be the same thing
[5:30] for this royal seat before the promised
[5:33] son returns
[5:34] notice that all Vale that hid the glory
[5:38] the old badger skins there was no Beauty
[5:41] to be desired of it neither was his
[5:43] flesh that's reason people said a little
[5:45] stooped over fella like that probably
[5:47] thirty years old gray beard gray wasn't
[5:49] much to look at the Bible said there's
[5:51] no beauty we should desire him he didn't
[5:52] look like a king the old badger skin oh
[5:54] what was on the inside now a little
[5:57] bunch of Holy Roller sitting together in
[5:58] a hot building like this they call them
[6:00] not much beauty to be desired but what's
[6:02] only
[6:03] I'm sure it's veiled from many hearts
[6:05] all right outwardly it was nothing but
[6:08] always on the inside once the inside of
[6:12] it then you see it how did you get into
[6:15] it shaking hands yawning no born into it
[6:18] dying get rid of your old badger skin
[6:20] see your old self to get into a new one
[6:23] thing forsake the old badger skins this
[6:26] Shekinah light does not listen ministers
[6:31] ministers I want you to listen to this
[6:34] when once inside I will take this real
[6:39] easy so he'd be sure together once
[6:41] inside the veil under the Shekinah glory
[6:44] the Shekinah light does not take the
[6:48] Word of God in reveal Jesus to be a
[6:50] fortune-teller know like the
[6:56] denominations do today mineral telepathy
[7:00] Holy Roller Beelzebub the Shekinah glory
[7:04] doesn't reveal in there but the Shekinah
[7:07] glory ripens the seed that's promised
[7:11] for that alpha by the word showing him
[7:13] to be still the lily the violet
[7:17] it brings forth that seed the lily the
[7:21] valley the bread of life the Alpha and
[7:25] Omega the same yesterday today and
[7:27] forever
[7:28] he is the believers potion the Shekinah
[7:31] glory reveals to the believer is the
[7:34] same yesterday today and forever not the
[7:37] days he's past and he died it's all over
[7:39] so Fran if you believe that if you
[7:43] believe that you've never struck the
[7:45] Shekinah glory how could the Shekinah
[7:48] glory ever reveal even three persons how
[7:53] could the Shekinah glory ever reveal him
[7:55] is being baptized people in the name of
[7:57] the Father Son and Holy Ghost when
[7:58] there's never a person in the Bible
[7:59] baptized that way how could the Shekinah
[8:03] glory limit him to an apostle when he's
[8:05] the same yesterday today and forever the
[8:08] Shekinah glory manifested it brings
[8:11] forth the word of promise right out to
[8:13] you that's reason that he had to veil
[8:15] Moses face because in him was the word
[8:19] he bailed Jesus as the humble little man
[8:22] to keep her from seeing Jehovah and he
[8:25] bails itself today in earthen vessels
[8:29] but the Shekinah outside looks like a
[8:32] bunch of holy rollers old badger skins
[8:34] but the enzyme hides the Shekinah glory
[8:39] it writings a shoe bread that we feast
[8:41] on and drive across a country for
[8:43] hundreds of miles
[8:45] it's the believers food it's only far
[8:49] believer remember the shewbread was only
[8:51] for the believer only shewbread seed
[8:55] notice what does it do
[8:57] that's Shekinah glory over the shewbread
[9:00] kept it from Sparling remember the manna
[9:03] that came from heaven it was stayed in
[9:05] the Shekinah glory from one generation
[9:07] to another outside it got wiggle tails
[9:11] in it overnight it contaminated is that
[9:14] right outside of the Shekinah glory the
[9:17] days of miracles is past
[9:20] see it's all fanaticism
[9:22] but inside look they got some sunflower
[9:27] seed out of a garner in Egypt that
[9:31] put in there in the days of Joseph 4000
[9:34] years nearly ago Joseph putting in the
[9:37] garner they planted him they lived what
[9:41] they had life
[9:42] what's this Shekinah glory today to
[9:44] break me on the veil to see who God is
[9:46] standing before you see who God is
[9:48] standing here before us the the pillar
[9:50] fire
[9:51] he's veiled in human flesh but what does
[9:54] this what does it do
[9:55] the shewbread sees the word that were to
[9:59] live on in this name of these promises
[10:01] the Shekinah glory write-ins that
[10:04] shewbread brings up the past makes it
[10:06] brand to the believer that laid in the
[10:10] pages of the Bible year after year the
[10:13] word for this age to the denominations
[10:16] it's a stumbling block to the
[10:19] denominations they stumble headed down
[10:22] through the years Luther Wesley Martin
[10:24] Luther and all Sankey Finney John Smith
[10:27] knock all still elated but what's it to
[10:29] be there for the light stays what is to
[10:32] reveal bring forth what's now can't
[10:36] afford to do to turn back people from
[10:39] this stumbling block to break down the
[10:43] traditions and to reveal the bread with
[10:46] the Shekinah glory watch it ripen and
[10:48] produced just exactly what it said it
[10:50] would
[10:50] oh my the shoe brand for this age to the
[10:54] denomination of stumbling-block a bunch
[10:57] of fanatics but we who believe but now
[11:00] as revelation stands promise all the
[11:03] mysteries of God that's been hidden the
[11:06] pages down to them ears would be ripened
[11:11] brought forth in the age of the seventh
[11:14] angel's message is that right
[11:16] what did he say a year and six months
[11:19] ago right on two years now go out to
[11:22] Tucson the north of Tucson a great blast
[11:26] what would take place the seals would be
[11:28] open the seals that reveal these things
[11:31] come back just as he said what is it it
[11:35] shows it cannot be man it's perfectly
[11:37] just as straight as it can be each time
[11:39] what is it it's the hand of God
[11:43] the before us then because it's in a
[11:45] little group bailed in human flesh
[11:47] it's veiled to the outside world he's
[11:50] hid from the outside world he's
[11:52] revealing himself to babes such as well
[11:54] learners he should ever see ever parable
[11:57] in the Bible ever type of the Bible is
[11:59] made manifest right here before the
[12:01] saying God in the pillar fire that wrote
[12:03] the Bible both in the old and new
[12:04] Testament is right your manifest is
[12:06] showing just exactly what let's
[12:07] interpret it right back and to making
[12:10] sure that it's interpreters yo we got
[12:11] the interpretation then let's see it
[12:13] happen that's it made manifest manifest
[12:17] Jesus said if I do not the works of my
[12:19] father believe me not see it's got to be
[12:21] proven but now now I'm not proving like
[12:24] Jesus say put a rag around his head any
[12:26] more hits if your prophet tell us who
[12:28] hit you
[12:28] and if your other son of God turned
[12:30] these bread see that's the devil if
[12:31] you're the Son of God come off that I
[12:33] mean the revelation that he's supposed
[12:35] to do that's what it
[12:37] but now as revelation 10 is reveal the
[12:40] mysteries of God is made manifest known
[12:43] as the seven sealed book promise now
[12:47] that's your faith in Him who is the word
[12:50] false in revelations 10 it says a
[12:53] revelation is 19 whether I had wrote
[12:55] down here at least his ten to go to it
[12:57] but at 8:10 it's 19 when he comes he's
[12:59] going to be called the Word of God
[13:04] riding upon a white horse and followers
[13:08] of heaven will be behind you break the

[13:56] right among Asher unveiled the mighty
[13:59] God I'm conquered by traditions they
[14:04] tried to hide him behind there they did
[14:06] for years but the time of the promised
[14:09] through near God raised up a Moses one
[14:13] time and he set the children free from
[14:17] them thing and he's still he can't be
[14:20] conquered heavens and earth will pass

[14:51] others out maybe tonight notice no
[14:55] desist there was an action one time and
[15:00] the other little fiddle up you've heard
[15:01] it many times no valiant the auctioneer
[15:04] said what am I offered part I may not
[15:07] have this just right according to the
[15:09] point it's been many many years but it
[15:10] comes on my mind and they picked up the
[15:12] old fiddle it didn't look very much
[15:14] looks crummy everything he couldn't even
[15:18] get a bid on it
[15:19] Bonnie I think you ought to bid for a
[15:21] dollar or something like that and they
[15:24] were so understanding there that didn't
[15:27] think in order to sell for that so he
[15:28] went and picked it up it struck it in
[15:31] his hands picked up the bow and rosin it
[15:32] and he played a tune and when he did
[15:35] everyone started crying they never heard
[15:38] sits music in their life then the
[15:40] auctioneer said what am I offered two
[15:42] thousand five thousand ten thousand see
[15:45] what was it the master's hand revealed
[15:49] what was veiled in the old instruments
[15:53] same now the old book
[15:57] it's a ragged it's been left at Burt
[16:00] made fun of but the time has come that
[16:05] they've got a denominational auction
[16:08] world carol's of churches they're
[16:10] selling like nobody's business
[16:12] there's the denominational auction
[16:14] coming but remember there's something in
[16:17] the old book that promised that there be
[16:19] a predestinated ordain hand come one day
[16:22] and we pick it up and make the word of
[16:25] this book to a predestinated heart did
[16:30] the task gets made far reveal the
[16:32] promises that's in it might look like a
[16:35] bunch of holy rollers or something there
[16:37] but just takes a master's hand the word
[16:39] on it to reveal that word and because
[16:41] more than a Holy Roller
[16:42] has become that to every one of us has
[16:44] new friends it's not a bunch of
[16:46] fanaticism this offends over whose hand
[16:49] the bows they let us pray our Heavenly
[16:53] Father by faith today I see the master
[17:00] of the old book that they have swapped
[17:04] for traditions they swapped it for
[17:07] denominations they tried to trade it off
[17:10] now they're trading it for a world
[17:14] council of man of churches communist
[17:18] ting a theistic the auction zone Lord
[17:23] God step forth surely you will send us
[17:31] that profit lord that picks up that bow
[17:34] that picks up this word proves that
[17:40] Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today
[17:42] and forever
[17:45] many Lord will sell their lives they'll
[17:49] throw away their old traditions he'll
[17:50] break the veils they won't it Lord
[17:54] they'll give anything anything just give
[17:58] them Jesus Lord I think you've proved it
[18:00] to them now they come from everywhere
[18:03] they spend their livings they do
[18:05] everything to try to get to the meetings
[18:06] to do all they can because they found
[18:09] that pearl of great prizes
[18:10] other things are very little bless them
[18:14] father laying on this pulpit this
[18:17] morning Lord lace handkerchiefs maybe
[18:18] someone will have to leave today before
[18:20] the healing service tonight Oh eternal
[18:23] God look down I know you're here you're
[18:27] veiled and I'm sending these little
[18:30] veils Lord called handkerchiefs and
[18:33] little aprons and little booties for
[18:35] little babies and I'm standing as little
[18:38] bail tokens that your word has been
[18:40] preached towards this morning and as a
[18:42] believer I lay my hands upon them my
[18:44] body is signifying and I believe it and
[18:48] by faith each one in this building is
[18:50] doing the same Lord may the sick get
[18:52] well you can stroke the the word from
[18:57] here Lord like the old violinist did to
[18:59] the violin make it so Lord make it play
[19:02] the right tune only the Masters hand and
[19:06] we will seem standing in full view how
[19:08] those people must have thought that day
[19:09] when they wouldn't give nothing when
[19:11] they didn't give nothing for the old
[19:13] violin they didn't want it they wouldn't
[19:15] have in their house but when once picked
[19:18] up by the one who could master it then
[19:21] they sold everything they had to get it
[19:22] there was less than fighting over was
[19:26] too late then so would it be somehow
[19:28] when the trumpet of the Lord shall be
[19:30] sounded out times shall be no more those
[19:34] who've been looked at and made fun of
[19:36] and stood there before the open veil had
[19:39] seen the Word of God manifested others
[19:41] will scream part but as you said it'll
[19:44] be too late then they went into the
[19:46] wedding supper and they were left out
[19:48] where there's weeping wailing and
[19:49] gnashing of teeth help every person to
[19:51] believe this morning father
[19:52] breakthrough every bale of selfishness
[19:54] ever veil of unbelief and see the mighty
[19:57] conquer unveiled before the believers or
[20:01] lo I am with you always even to the end
[20:04] of the world a little while in the world

[20:08] yet ye shall see me show yourself among
[20:13] us Lord as you have into it ever remain
[20:15] that way until we are visibly before you
[20:18] when the amorphous has been changed and
[20:22] you become again son of man and son of
[20:25] David Brennan Lord to Jesus Christ's
[20:28] name while we have our heads bowed and
[20:32] all in prayer wonder today if there's
[20:37] some here that inside or out there's no
[20:40] way to bring an altar call up here
[20:41] because there's no room but I wonder
[20:44] sincerely you believe this to be the
[20:47] truth you believe that in this day that
[20:50] we're living in all this chaos and
[20:53] scientific age like one of the days of
[20:55] Noah and the days of Moses the days of
[20:59] Christ that God the great father of all
[21:02] of us who are born into him stands among
[21:07] us today this visible pillar of fire
[21:10] that's scientifically proven many years
[21:12] ago as the little boy spoke to me out
[21:14] there and told me how to live right here
[21:16] what would take place telling you about
[21:18] it one day down Little River before the
[21:21] ministry started first revival he
