[30:39] avida a little child came to life
[30:44] and was filled with the holy ghost
[30:53] and this night we will also once again
[30:55] want to be full of his presence
[30:59] and to delight herself
[31:16] is
[31:26] it's our privilege to speak a little bit
[31:27] and bring a little bit of light upon
[31:28] what the prophet spoke of the seven
[31:30] visions
[31:36] that was given to our prophet and
[31:38] brother william branham
[32:02] [Music]
[32:11] [Music]
[32:12] i didn't think god would ever give me
[32:14] this privilege
[32:17] to be with my brother in the flesh
[32:20] he was the baby of the family
[32:26] just a minute for a minute not to be so
[32:28] tense
[32:34] pray for me i have about five things
[32:35] bothering me
[32:38] i fell off of my bed
[32:54] but i did tell my wife
[32:56] why did you knock me out of bed
[33:06] there are things that happen in life
[33:22] to see just how much we could speak on
[33:26] what can we say
[33:28] what's in our hearts
[33:31] what a pastor we have okay
[33:33] because he calls us
[33:36] and
[33:37] sometimes we don't want to do the job
[33:40] we get scared
[33:43] but what he wants us for us to do is to
[33:44] participate
[33:47] and it's better to obey brothers
[34:05] all our lot to speak on the seven
[34:06] divisions
[34:08] and nothing is by coincidence
[34:12] today is the 7th of september
[34:16] 7 visions
[34:18] here
[34:45] to speak a little bit on the first
[34:47] vision
[34:52] the first vision the lord shows to
[34:53] brother brennan
[34:57] is the invasion of mussolini
[35:00] of mussolini
[35:15] and he's seeing it very clearly
[35:22] i was thinking when i was contemplating
[35:24] on division
[35:27] this was a very cruel man
[35:31] he was a dictator
[35:36] yeah you know what a dictator is he does
[35:38] everything according to his luck
[35:40] as the mexicans as we say
[35:55] he said
[35:56] ethiopia
[36:22] invading such a poor nation almost
[36:35] [Music]
[36:37] they use the most horrible thing they
[36:38] could use against
[36:52] atrocities
[37:20] a
[37:49] and it was occupied by italia cruelly
[37:51] for 10 years
[37:52] mussolini
[37:54] from italy from mussolini
[37:57] and that began in 1935.
[38:12] it does not give you a lot of material
[38:13] this gives you the vision
[38:16] you have to go and dig out the
[38:17] information
[38:20] what the vision is declaring
[38:25] ethiopia is the land of the queen the
[38:28] sabbath
[38:29] the sheba
[38:37] is one of the most important figures of
[38:38] the old testament
[38:42] went to jerusalem all the way to
[38:43] jerusalem
[39:12] and it had a purpose
[39:18] and this vision is the first vision that
[39:19] god shows to brother branham
[39:25] so much death
[39:54] another invasion into africa
[40:01] but to show life
[40:04] and life in abundance
[40:06] at that time back then
[40:21] is
[40:37] life
[40:38] and you have seen it
[40:41] and your witnesses
[40:48] because this ministry is not going to
[40:50] bring down it's
[41:46] is
[42:15] establishment of that vision
[42:18] god bless
[42:24] you
[42:26] important fact about mussolini and this
[42:54] to chastise them with such horrible
[42:57] things
[43:07] millions of italians died because of the
[43:10] orders that was given by mussolini their
[43:12] leader
[43:14] mussolini when we see the idea of
[43:17] mussolini
[43:20] we see a man very wicked and very
[43:23] bad
[44:11] he wanted to go in such a way that he
[44:12] wanted to go and get trained to be a
[44:14] priest
[44:31] he becomes one of the worst dictators of
[44:33] the 20th century
[45:16] he communicated nothing to anybody
[45:19] on what his plans were
[45:26] and it is a type that reflects to us
[45:28] even within christianity
[45:33] [Music]
[45:43] it is things like those that cause
[45:44] disasters deaths yes
[45:48] and it's the same in the spiritual
[45:51] experiment
[45:55] i've been able to experience it not here
[45:57] i come from another country
[46:07] i've seen brethren families that die on
[46:09] the way because of the decision of a bad
[46:11] leader
[46:26] 2020
[46:41] once again we thank god for sending a
[46:43] prophet william marion
[46:47] a message that we love so much and then
[46:48] we embrace
[46:51] as the scripture says
[47:08] they went forth in the wilderness
[47:13] as they went forth
[47:18] jehoshaphat
[47:19] stood and said
[47:22] hear
[47:33] so shall you be established
[47:49] to give us the opportunity
[48:02] the first coming of christ
[48:19] and that we believe
[48:22] lord bless this service
[48:24] and we support ourselves
[48:27] in the name of the lord jesus christ
[48:29] you may be seated
[48:31] in the second half
[49:01] he will rise as a dictator in germany
[49:07] and he would conduce the whole world
[49:09] into a world war
[49:10] mostra la lina
[49:12] siegfried
[49:14] he made the siegfried line
[49:23] and i saw that our troops would have a
[49:24] very strong battle to be able to
[49:26] overcome it
[49:32] division also showed that hitler would
[49:34] have a mysterious end
[49:37] adolfo hitler adolf hitler
[49:40] [Music]
[49:42] um
[49:44] he was born on april 20th
[49:48] 1989.
[49:52] he was born in austria
[49:57] it was about when he was three years old
[50:00] when his parents
[50:02] were familiar
[50:03] they took their family their children
[50:05] [Music]
[50:09] hitler was the third among the children
[50:13] and they they moved to to germany
[50:18] when hitler had the opportunity
[50:21] to go to the war
[50:32] it was one of the most fantastic and
[50:33] great experiences that he could have had
[50:38] i think
[51:20] but here's
[52:03] politico he associated himself with a
[52:05] political party there in germany
[52:10] this political party was called
[52:14] national socialist
[52:39] the national party of socialism
[52:42] that they work in
[52:57] he began to place new laws
[53:13] himself into a dictator
[53:17] he he put aside everything
[53:21] he was not interested in democracy
[53:24] and to make these laws
[53:30] it made strong his dominion and
[53:33] his sovereignty
[53:39] he became a dictator and authoritarian
[53:46] and fulfilling exactly what this vision
[53:48] said it would be okay
[53:50] for hitler this young man
[53:54] he would be
[54:09] the vision also spoke of the la lignia
[54:12] sacred about the siegfried line estalini
[54:15] amigo this sit-free line is
[54:20] a tunnel
[54:51] it was 300 kilometers long this secret
[54:54] line
[54:55] loquera is stalin what this line was
[55:03] it had approximately in its construction
[55:05] 18 000.
[55:07] [Music]
[55:08] it had 18 000 to 20 000 bunkers
[55:13] constructed in concrete
[55:17] in that whole line
[55:34] they put all these military artillery
[55:36] and these bunkers
[55:39] there's also a tunnel
[55:43] where they would drive cars
[56:16] germany took nine years to construct
[56:18] this wall on this line
[56:23] from about 1936
[56:28] about to 1944
[56:46] he spoke of how these bunkers of
[56:48] concrete would be constructed
[56:52] and how all the artillery would be
[56:53] placed in these bunkers
[56:57] the prophet saw clearly and described it
[57:00] very well
[57:07] june 6 1944
[57:38] and hundreds
[57:55] to liberate europe from the germany's
[57:58] control
[57:59] and to be able to do that
[58:02] they had to break through that line
[58:06] aberlin
[58:20] when
[58:49] of these
[58:50] planes in
[58:51] sientos
[58:56] americanos
[58:57] hundreds and thousands of american
[58:59] soldiers
[59:01] and uh of the soldiers of the alliance
[59:06] that was the warning
[59:10] that the boy spoke to brother brenham
[59:15] how united we received
[59:44] believe in the lord and your god and you
[59:46] shall be established
[59:49] believe his prophets
[59:56] if the united states would have heard
[59:57] this voice
[1:00:12] how the united states would suffer a
[1:00:13] great loss there
[1:00:16] and the
[1:00:17] the armies of the alliance and human
[1:00:20] lives they would lose so many
[1:00:22] estados
[1:00:23] to the united states in all their
[1:00:24] alliances
[1:00:29] it took them six to seven months
[1:00:33] to break through their lines
[1:00:39] and to be able to liberate yeah germany
[1:00:42] from the control of
[1:00:44] of uh hitler
[1:00:48] how many lives were sacrificed
[1:00:53] the prophecy was fulfilled exactly
[1:00:58] the united states was suffering a great
[1:00:59] loss
[1:01:06] it wasn't until 1945. when
[1:01:23] of germany
[1:01:25] remember
[1:01:27] division
[1:01:30] that hitler would have a mysterious end
[1:01:33] and it was on
[1:01:36] april 30th 1945.
[1:01:41] when the publications first came out
[1:01:44] through radio
[1:01:45] television
[1:01:47] television
[1:01:50] hitler had died
[1:01:53] they declared that he committed suicide
[1:01:59] but russia could never prove that
[1:02:04] they
[1:02:57] and he took the world and germany to a
[1:02:59] world war
[1:03:04] he created that line almost 620
[1:03:06] kilometers
[1:03:11] where the united states and all that
[1:03:12] their alliance suffered such
[1:03:40] his mom was a christian impressive
[1:03:55] it's just something too
[1:03:59] here's just something
[1:04:00] that says in broken cisterns
[1:04:07] these dictators feel so powerful
[1:04:10] established
[1:04:38] broken
[1:04:52] i'd like to add something
[1:04:56] i get excited
[1:05:03] you see the natural and also in the
[1:05:05] spiritual
[1:05:08] i i don't i hope not to get into
[1:05:10] problems with anybody
[1:05:15] and i'll ask the question how many nazis
[1:05:17] are here not so lucky not only here oh
[1:05:34] is
[1:05:48] and
[1:05:55] but within that lifestyle there began to
[1:05:57] be separations amongst themselves
[1:06:00] they came to have lots of power
[1:06:04] and then communism arrived
[1:06:11] and we must understand these are spirits
[1:06:13] that are evolving
[1:06:33] and many times as christians we put it
[1:06:35] in lines
[1:06:39] as i say back in my land
[1:06:46] you would go to a certain place and ask
[1:06:47] you what line are you from you know wow
[1:06:50] you'd say wow
[1:06:52] what what line
[1:06:56] i understand
[1:06:58] that i
[1:07:10] and according to the message there
[1:07:11] should only not be any more but one line
[1:07:16] by which the germ of god
[1:07:18] runs
[1:07:24] so seeing all this it brings me back to
[1:07:26] the same point
[1:07:29] what kind of a spirit is it that i have
[1:07:32] [Music]
[1:07:35] if i don't share with brother diego
[1:07:38] and i make a line
[1:08:09] and the prophet of god he also gave us a
[1:08:12] bomb
[1:08:15] and he says the most powerful bomb that
[1:08:17] god has upon the earth
[1:08:19] it is love
[1:08:22] solomon
[1:08:38] and the third vision was about the
[1:08:40] political dominion
[1:08:44] it showed me there was great three great
[1:08:46] isms
[1:08:50] and communism
[1:09:17] to speak on these issues
[1:09:22] we hear the word fascism
[1:09:26] we don't even understand what that is
[1:09:30] even when we hear the news
[1:10:00] these two
[1:10:01] faster
[1:10:15] these two political movements
[1:10:20] they drug within millions of people
[1:10:23] europa this is what was moving in europe
[1:10:28] it was something so
[1:11:09] fascism was born
[1:11:24] very intelligent
[1:11:27] did he he loved so much to read books
[1:11:29] the literature
[1:11:34] he liked the books of
[1:11:36] philosophers
[1:12:11] he's the one that puts in literature and
[1:12:13] writes this on fascism
[1:12:17] this happened in 1920
[1:12:39] [Music]
[1:12:48] as you said at the beginning
[1:12:55] but when it's written in a constitution
[1:13:00] now it's not a thought now it's allah
[1:13:32] it opens up the way for it to become a
[1:13:34] dictatorship
[1:13:36] that's what fascism
[1:13:38] that's where it was born
[1:13:44] just to know that the characteristics of
[1:13:45] what it is fascism
[1:13:48] capitalism
[1:13:49] it's against capitalism
[1:13:53] they're racist
[1:13:57] about all about
[1:13:58] themselves they're very military-minded
[1:14:07] this power one is born here the fascism
[1:14:10] power
[1:14:12] this
[1:14:23] [Music]
[1:14:55] it was a national moment of the workers
[1:15:02] when it was headed up by adolf hitler
[1:15:08] did he adopt
[1:15:22] it forms certain characters in them
[1:15:27] where it talks about to purify the races
[1:15:31] we're speaking now on nationalism
[1:15:37] the isn't is of one idea
[1:15:40] now there's no longer political parties
[1:15:46] it speaks only of one person
[1:15:50] okay
[1:17:11] you hear people raise up to want to
[1:17:13] adopt these
[1:17:14] nasa's
[1:17:44] everything is public property
[1:17:49] and it proclaims
[1:17:50] social equality for allah
[1:18:24] sister
[1:18:26] there's there's isms
[1:18:28] fascism nazism and communism
[1:18:33] but it got my attention what ism means
[1:18:52] why would he say that
[1:18:53] ism
[1:18:56] i i looked at the word ism it was a
[1:18:58] significant term
[1:19:00] and i looked at what that was
[1:19:03] just a little bit more
[1:19:06] i found out just like it says here
[1:19:10] it's a systemic form
[1:19:12] significa
[1:19:13] that can mean
[1:19:15] doctrine
[1:19:20] school or movement
[1:19:23] that's the the term of the word isn't it
[1:19:33] mechanism or doctrine out of this
[1:19:45] one person can be a denomination
[1:20:02] the seven visions of the prophets
[1:20:09] like to read that verse for the bible
[1:20:11] says
[1:20:12] 37 amos 3 7.
[1:20:29] but he revealed his secret unto his
[1:20:31] servants the prophets
[1:20:38] the meaning of the word vision
[1:20:42] is
[1:21:42] it was headed up in the vision of a
[1:21:44] plastic car
[1:21:46] yes
[1:21:49] the car was running down very
[1:21:52] beautiful streets
[1:21:55] with a by remote control
[1:22:04] the people appear to be seated in this
[1:22:06] car
[1:22:08] without a steering wheel
[1:22:12] and they were playing some sort of game
[1:22:21] i'd like to go a bit further back to the
[1:22:23] times of noah
[1:22:31] because this was just a little bit
[1:22:36] costly
[1:22:51] candace says
[1:22:52] in genesis 6
[1:22:58] 8.
[1:23:02] it says but noah found grace in the eyes
[1:23:24] the end of all flesh is come before me
[1:23:25] for the earth is filled with violence
[1:23:27] through them and behold i will destroy
[1:23:29] them with the earth
[1:23:37] make the an arc of gopher wood
[1:23:41] room shall that make in the arc
[1:23:46] convent and shall pitch it within and
[1:23:50] without with pitch
[1:23:55] is to have a reference with the time
[1:23:56] that we have
[1:24:15] revelation chapter 4 and this is part
[1:24:17] number two
[1:24:23] and he preached that in january
[1:24:34] i don't
[1:24:35] speak too much but now i'm speaking a
[1:24:36] little too much
[1:24:41] and i'll try to read it
[1:24:44] [Music]
[1:24:56] foreign
[1:25:07] abraham for the little help he gave me
[1:25:09] and now and uh
[1:25:11] and the only thing
[1:25:12] he done
[1:25:15] was
[1:25:18] foolish
[1:25:20] in sensato silly
[1:25:23] do exactly with his science
[1:25:26] exactly
[1:25:37] god never destroyed the world
[1:25:41] man destroys the world
[1:25:45] god don't destroy nothing
[1:25:48] destruction
[1:25:49] god tries to preserve everything the
[1:26:00] in the same paragraph a little further
[1:26:02] down
[1:26:04] so some fanatic
[1:27:44] only
[1:27:58] one
[1:28:10] and some of them
[1:28:25] these are the egyptian pyramids
[1:28:29] and we have the sphinx
[1:28:31] as well
[1:28:39] and how could we imagine that that would
[1:28:42] take place
[1:28:50] and something that caught my attention
[1:28:52] as part of the vision that there were
[1:28:54] supernatural powers
[1:29:02] and now this comes to fit in
[1:29:07] something that brother
[1:29:09] thomas preached in one of his his
[1:29:10] messages
[1:29:14] and god's astronauts
[1:29:19] as many people in this time have a mind
[1:29:21] music
[1:29:22] it's very scientific
[1:29:26] and it's good to go into science
[1:29:29] but this is a good part here
[1:29:34] science only proves that the materials
[1:29:36] we use hormonal
[1:29:51] are only things that we need to form
[1:29:54] to form something
[1:29:57] science cannot form it
[1:30:00] they can fabricate it
[1:30:03] they cannot create
[1:30:06] they can fabricate it
[1:30:10] science is something that we have
[1:30:13] that we can do
[1:30:15] we can do things with it
[1:30:31] without the substance you cannot
[1:30:36] then it is impossible to please god
[1:30:44] speaking of division where brother adam
[1:30:46] saw the cause
[1:31:00] in these uh cars that were bubble shaped
[1:31:03] or an egg shape
[1:31:10] and these self driving vehicles they
[1:31:12] would no longer use pedals or steering
[1:31:14] wheels
[1:31:40] but the the word of god the the word of
[1:31:42] the prophet does not
[1:31:55] like i said it's a reality what we are
[1:31:57] living now
[1:31:58] in california you're announcing in
[1:32:00] california
[1:32:06] if they get to the year of 2035
[1:32:10] electricity
[1:33:04] quickly
[1:33:17] when you break your promise and your
[1:33:19] covenant with the word of god
[1:33:25] that is what has caused so many
[1:33:27] illegitimate members in the church
[1:33:34] is significance a group of men gathered
[1:33:37] together and declared well it that
[1:33:39] simply doesn't mean that
[1:33:43] organization and that caused all of the
[1:33:46] organizations
[1:34:00] we believe that because dr jones has
[1:34:02] said
[1:34:12] he said all a word of man be a lie
[1:34:41] the line of life also breaks
[1:34:46] and also the line of time has broken
[1:34:50] the covenant is broken
[1:34:53] [Music]
[1:34:54] it was all ruined
[1:34:58] what caused all of this
[1:35:03] that is what broke the covenant
[1:35:06] if you desire to read it in genesis
[1:35:09] in genesis chapter 3.
[1:35:17] and the prophet says it was given unto
[1:35:19] men to govern over the woman
[1:35:22] by the word of god
[1:35:26] she was no longer equal to you
[1:35:30] she was no longer equal to him
[1:35:35] you know she was the same as him
[1:35:40] but when she broke the word of god
[1:35:45] god decreed for man to govern over her
[1:35:50] genesis 3 16.
[1:35:53] the prophet says
[1:36:05] having done that being in that elevated
[1:36:08] order is
[1:36:11] she was at the same level as man
[1:36:18] she lost her equality with man cuando
[1:36:21] peco when she sinned idiot
[1:36:50] he was everything except the creator
[1:36:53] he was everything established
[1:36:57] he was at the right hand of god in the
[1:36:58] heavens
[1:37:01] and he was a great leader of the cherub
[1:37:03] the cherubims
[1:37:14] it was not formed as a part of the
[1:37:17] original creation
[1:37:33] there's nothing designed that could be
[1:37:35] so easily deceived as a woman
[1:37:39] there's nothing designed
[1:37:43] that could go to such a
[1:37:46] low level of vulgarity
[1:37:49] as a woman
[1:37:52] think closely
[1:37:57] there's nothing in all creation that
[1:37:59] could go down to such a level
[1:38:16] sweet wife begins to go out with another
[1:38:18] man
[1:38:21] and you see that poor man seated
[1:38:24] crying with his children
[1:38:28] that is how she is designed
[1:38:31] see you
[1:38:32] and i continue we are
[1:38:35] listen
[1:38:36] says
[1:38:42] he says
[1:38:46] it is the woman who is more beautiful
[1:38:49] not the man
[1:38:54] if it is the man then something is wrong
[1:39:00] in some place the seed crossed
[1:39:02] originally
[1:39:05] originally it was soul
[1:39:08] because she was made that
[1:39:10] to deceive
[1:39:20] is still working in here in these last
[1:39:22] days
[1:39:54] go to the beach they're no longer women
[1:39:56] but plastic
[1:40:00] and we need the he that picks up to
[1:40:02] recycle we need him to come by
[1:40:05] diablo
[1:40:20] i was reading and i said
[1:40:22] my god okay
[1:40:25] and the prophet says
[1:40:32] who began to work in her
[1:40:34] allah
[1:40:50] it is his principal weapon to make man
[1:40:53] fall
[1:40:55] and worldliness uncleanliness
[1:41:01] it's what the prophet saw in this vision
[1:41:06] how woman would fall into such a
[1:41:07] condition
[1:41:14] i want to add something to give a
[1:41:15] tradition to the next vision
[1:41:27] and according to the law she had to be
[1:41:28] stoned jesus implemented
[1:41:33] and jesus he knelt down and he began to
[1:41:35] write on this on the on the ground
[1:41:40] the bible says when jesus stood back up
[1:41:46] he asked where are them that condemned
[1:41:48] you
[1:41:50] but there was no one there
[1:41:53] in about this time
[1:41:57] or for this time and thanks god for we
[1:42:00] thank god for a profit
[1:42:06] i believe the greatest sign for his
[1:42:07] people as a prophet
[1:42:12] in that time there was a man who stood
[1:42:13] up
[1:42:15] he took a rock a stone
[1:42:18] and he threw it up in the air
[1:42:20] and when it fell
[1:42:25] almost all the coast of alaska sinks
[1:42:30] because there was someone worthy to
[1:42:31] throw a rock
[1:42:35] god bless you
[1:42:37] to the next vision
[1:42:55] states grows up a very beautiful woman
[1:42:58] but very cruel
[1:43:01] she had the people completely under her
[1:43:03] control
[1:43:07] i thought this was the rising of the
[1:43:08] catholic church the roman catholic
[1:43:10] church
[1:43:14] in america
[1:43:15] that it could also be a woman rising up
[1:43:17] with great power in the united states
[1:43:22] elected by the popular one a vote of
[1:43:24] women
[1:43:30] i want to take the words of brother when
[1:43:31] he says
[1:43:48] is
[1:43:54] a lot of people are normal people
[1:43:56] teachers and preachers of this message
[1:44:02] they've gotten ahead to try to bring
[1:44:03] what judgment means
[1:44:08] i stay with what brother branham said
[1:44:12] that god introduced his own word
[1:44:18] that's why i want to bring these words
[1:44:19] when brother brenham speaks algunas de
[1:44:22] las prophecies
[1:44:24] many of the prophecies are compounded
[1:44:27] they have a double fulfillment
[1:44:30] and he gives an example this is
[1:44:52] now we begin to see how this prophecy of
[1:44:54] this woman begins to be fulfilled
[1:44:58] this vision unfolded in 1933
[1:45:29] woman that took israel into idolatry
[1:45:36] they were in such a backslidden
[1:45:39] state
[1:45:42] to permit
[1:46:24] is
[1:46:52] begin to see how this prophecy unfolds
[1:46:54] siegel mensah man following hearing the
[1:46:57] message
[1:46:59] that's the way it is
[1:47:03] when ahab was on the throne
[1:47:06] you say
[1:47:31] she obligated ahab to do it
[1:47:56] he's not speaking about his wife he's
[1:47:57] talking about the religion the catholic
[1:47:59] religion that's behind the scene
[1:48:02] the
[1:48:16] she
[1:48:27] he couldn't say nothing because it was
[1:48:28] his wife
[1:48:44] see how she's infiltrating very
[1:48:46] discreetly speaking of the catholic
[1:48:48] church
[1:48:49] at that time
[1:48:53] we were a christian nation
[1:48:56] the world news is that
[1:49:10] until now she's on the throne
[1:49:14] he's speaking about the roman catholic
[1:49:16] system el trono de la casa blanca the
[1:49:19] throne of the white house
[1:49:24] apoge
[1:50:06] but this system behind will push him to
[1:50:08] do that
[1:51:05] but she was the principal head
[1:51:08] behind the throne
[1:51:10] catholic and the roman hierarchy
[1:51:15] is not on the tone of the united states
[1:51:32] the bible says this the nation
[1:51:37] arise and an image likened to the beast
[1:51:40] the seventh vision
[1:51:44] it potentially was fulfilled
[1:51:46] kennedy
[1:52:20] the message
[1:52:42] in reality is
[1:52:57] you're seeing that fulfillment here
[1:52:58] clearly of the sixth vision
[1:53:01] but it doesn't finish there
[1:53:06] is in church
[1:53:09] catholic we've had one
[1:53:38] but it's
[1:53:51] in the message mark of the beast
[1:54:06] in my heart it says by grace
[1:54:08] the united states is what it is
[1:54:16] in the seven division i heard a
[1:54:18] horrible explosion
[1:54:20] when i turned around
[1:54:23] did you see what i was saying
[1:54:26] everything was right there there were
[1:54:27] craters
[1:54:30] smoking craters over all the lands
[1:54:33] no problem
[1:54:48] what are the signs at the end
[1:54:51] everything that is happening
[1:54:54] it would be plagues
[1:54:56] what happened with corona virus
[1:55:58] in
[1:56:13] in america
[1:56:14] i look and think how many of those they
[1:56:16] had to drop in order to destroy america
[1:56:19] i remember the angel said
[1:56:23] because the message teaches us
[1:56:39] and how we're lacking oil right now
[1:56:43] and there are many nations that have
[1:56:44] many reserves
[1:56:47] and the united states is one of them
[1:56:52] this president before wanting to do it
[1:56:54] and he can
[1:57:49] for his purpose
[1:58:46] against this
[1:58:56] god bless you brother
[1:59:28] and what will be
[1:59:30] glory
[1:59:31] we give you all the glory in the name of
[1:59:33] the lord jesus christ
[1:59:37] [Applause]
[1:59:46] amen thank you
[1:59:48] god servants may god richly bless you
[1:59:51] thank you for the word
[1:59:54] and applause to the creator can you give
[1:59:56] the lord jesus a mighty hand of a praise
