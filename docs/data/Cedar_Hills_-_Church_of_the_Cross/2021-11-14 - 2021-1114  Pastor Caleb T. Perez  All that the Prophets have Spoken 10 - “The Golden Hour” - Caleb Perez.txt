reclaim what belongs to them our sister nika says please continue praying for emmy she's in the hospital they found she has blood clots in one of her lungs the prayer changes things as your prophet to death from sickness to healing lord we believe it have mercy in ourselves that this may be an opportunity give healing to your daughter they are both in the icu and hospital at the hospital with kovid

moment he was in day to carry you through tell me a day he wasn't less than almighty when he could there was never so be strong in the lord and remember to take hold of faith and stand firm you can be confident the lord keeps his promises and if you doubt that is sure of glory divine i've been near to salvation i'm born of his spirit and we're washed in his blood so tell me a day that he's not been faithful tell me a morning his mercies were new tell me a moment he wasn't willing to carry you through tell he me less than an almighty when he could not roll back the tide when you look back it was never time tell me tell me tell me one day that he hasn't been faithful he's still been faithful to us i want to ask you to stand together we have come to the most important part of the service and that is the hearing of the word of god we're going to ask our pastor to come and take this desk as we're seeing at the cross at the cross in la cruz how many are happy this morning i'm going to ask you just to raise your hand just raise your hands to him not to me to him he's in the building right now be obliged he that was in my heart my my dad would sing this first oh oh i bless you this morning in the presence of the lord jesus christ this morning and our pastor this morning what a job this morning huh when may god bless you this morning we are happy to be in the house of the lord happy to be here this morning hey man why don't you turn around and wave at your neighbor neighbor it's good to see you bless you as we uh we heard it certainly is good to have uh brother brother rhys for the junior race and sister joanna with us god bless you all some of them are on vacation where they may be and i am i am extra glad to be here but uh anyways he was so kind to lend me his side by side we were out we're glad we're okay and then i'll go on with the message but but as i said this is why i'm glad to be here today we were we had gone up this steep hill to go on top of this ridge if we could find some deer on the way down but a big old rock in the middle of the road a i went around the rock to try to try to not not not get myself off off of uh not to get too much sideways but when i did the the side of that road it gave way that the the will gave way to it it was me and brother evans in the front and brother daniel was on this side with me was in the back on that side here goes the whole side by side you know it this whole thing and once it made that last turn it was going to go down the hill as the rear split off the road started tilting by the grace of god only only god knows it was his hand that was holding it up and uh it uh brother brother evans got off and then when he saw it was about to go and we were trying to hold it in all i could think is what am i going to tell mark am i going to tell you buddy i know what he would have said as long as you're okay i don't care about the bike here comes this this old man trying to help us and he well i've been praying this whole time but i'll pray again brother evan said a really beautiful prayer he said lord we have done all that we know how to do it now we need you you can hear the testimony of brother daniel and but i kid you not the moment right around the corner here comes this big old ram big old we sure can use your help we had a rope and we tied off the back end so that it wouldn't tilt and i ended up having to turn it and then i found a path to go down and we didn't damage were out they were out they wanted to squirrel hunt he asked the man that was with him he's the brother he says can you go ask the rancher for it's okay if we hunt his property nobody can hunt my turned around and says i give that man eternal life give the other man many chances and so when he said that i said well i know where you're going with this brother evans speak it and give those men that helped us out eternal life that is the greater works the greater works is to be able to impart eternal life and we cannot impart eternal life if we do not have eternal life that's why i'm glad to be here this morning an adventure but the lord knows all things would you stand to your feet as we read the scriptures we are grateful to god for his word thank the musicians and and those musicals them to call me up it must be bare bones i think most of our musicians or on that side are out yeah he's learning god bless him amen amen and the rest of the musicians god bless and the the grace for the special to be able to voice your word it is the grandest privilege that i know in my life you will continue to give me the the opportunities to preach to your people lord people would would come out of it or ah that's the years of the listeners of revelation lord we pray that you begin to reveal yourself lord today thank you once again lord we leave this service and ourselves in your hands precious name of the lord jesus christ amen amen we want to go as the scripture we've been reading luke 24 25. and it reads like this then he said unto them a fool's slow heart to believe all that the prophets have spoken we can go to first kings the 18th chapter let's see what one of these prophets spoke first kings 18 17 and 18 reads and it came to pass when ahab saw elijah that ahab said unto him arthao he that troubleth israel it is watch what the prophet elijah answers back he answered i have not troubled israel but thou and thy father's house in that ye have forsaken the commandments of the lord and thou has followed baylor amen may god add his blessings to the reading of his word you may be seated the last time we spoke i'm going to remember didn't even remember what the what the subtitle was yes we spoke on the witch's party quite a strange topic but in that in that scripture or in that that teaching there in essence we found out how that there is more witchcraft that goes on in the church than people realized people always looking to the outside from outside when we spoke on this and i want to just kind of give a little background it was paul that was the galatians what a question that he was asking the people of that day what a thing it was when he when he confronted the issue he said all foolish galatians who have bewitched you or who have put a spell on you okay and we found out how much that uh that goes on in a church bewitching i want you i want to make sure that you remember what we were talking about this jezebel system is like a web that once you're in it it is almost impossible to get out of it notice i didn't say it was impossible i said almost impossible because when the when christ comes on the scene trying to help the people get out of the system that and we want to bring you into a system that god has placed it has infiltrated almost every area it is the system that the beast and the image of the beast both use is why the subtitle is the golden hour those things they deal with the the the catholic church and and the denominations the bible says that everyone whose name was not written on that lamb's book of life the bible says they will be deceived that's why jesus told the disciples because the devils are subject to you but because your names are written it controls every aspect of people's lives today this is why jesus said in john 14 19 and the world sees me no more because i live church system will see me no more that's why it's not limited just to the world system it's not limited just to politics beast uses yet a little while in the world or the church system would see me no more why because he is now outside of the church how can they see him when he's not even in there with them but it is made up of members things that so many people are not seeing him no more william branham brother bernie and then brother tommy and then many golden times more we go on as long as we abide by that system we will see him the moment we get out of that system we will see him no more hello everybody hello coming to church don't save us amen this is how blessed we are yes what what is the system we talk about it's a boat that's right the system is a boat well i want you to get that up this system oh my gosh this is the man this is a big old complex thing it's just a boat let's put it as a boat that people are in right and in this boat we as the ministry are crying out to you every time we minister every time we preach we're not crying out against the people no jump church member sometimes people i don't want to go to church no more look at this yeah they cannot handle the pressures of the day i mean we have this we have this great man great our founding pastor he he mentioned this to the church he said i'd get up in the middle of the night at three in the morning and where was my wife you don't understand was it interceding no in what she was doing as a prayer warrior who was helping to hold or stem the tides so when these great men god takes them off the scenes to god our pastor's still here there he is that has him in a resting place i was asked a question i used what the it's either it's easier just to put all of all of the responsibility on the profit let's just listen we don't have to do anything else we are called to take on the responsibility many times the brethren think that i'm against my brothers i'm not against my brothers but it's the system and that is yes every church must but if that doctrine causes me to hate my brother that doctrine causes me to put a division amongst between me what happened to the quote that if you can't bitterly disagree with somebody something is wrong we better go back to the altar keeps us from being brothers did you get that look i thought i'm going to say it again that's why in a church where's the canadian language you have a lot of systems going on and the system that you join in with you want to join into that system that's up to you in the church there are many systems many clicks and you're sooner or later you're going to join in with one system or the other person did you themselves they canceled what happened almost always impossible possibly i want you to get this because we always think of the system as oh this is the great beast and oh my it's out there the same antichrist side by side in the church spirit of christ watch this watch what he says here it's the system we join into is that keeps us from being brothers i don't go to church no more because you are well you're a part of another you know if somebody didn't want to come to church that's that's fine i'm sorry but i gotta hit these devils that they were at the church i'm not speaking about one person in particular why can't they still love the people ah no you don't know what what they did i don't care it does not allow me to hate anybody on the other hand can't hate i'm sorry he can't love it it's against his nature he's not able to love no puede but when we can't as abraham and his seat after him that's the message poor hypocritical so-called christian oh this is the mouse shame on you your hour is at hand god will punish you for that as soon as i be his servant standing here why would god punish them because you're separating the laity and you're making differences between but he was against those systems that was keeping him away and he says keeping them away from him and that's the thing now it's the antichrist spirit that finally gets them to a place till they won't hear the truth no more i'm gonna remember what we talked about last time you ever hear people say that i know you don't care let me ask you the question have you ever said it you like it or not that's just the way you're being carnal you like it or not why don't you be spiritual and then you'll say lord this is the way i am and i don't like it i don't care 50 60 70 80 years lord i don't like it and i wouldn't still need to change ahab wasn't such a bad man brother branham says but he made his choice by marrying a beauty queen that was a pagan an idolater jezebel wasn't actually on the throne of israel but she was the main head behind the throne and the catholic hierarchy is not on the throne in the united states but she's the system that's behind it because he is john f kennedy john f kennedy the president el presidente he said he's not such a bad guy but he's married to that system that's why when the system is in place somebody runs for president i really mean well they want to do better they want to help the people he says but the system is already in place come say jezebel system they withstood many great persecutions and martyrdom under that false system of jezebel and this jezebel system was set up for one reason anybody tell me why it was set up this jezebel system was set up for one reason and one reason alone to conquer a servant of god and that system rose up and conquered the servant of god no idea jezebel system was created for that purpose that that servant of god that prophet of god was to bring but to keep it out of the hands watch this when jezebel got the power of the state behind her that's the antichrist spirit that is behind the whole system but we are so blessed not only to see christ but to recognize the antichrist i don't know how we take that for granted i don't know how many people no in the world millions and billions do not recognize the antichrist they don't recognize that spirit no recon yet you're blessed to see that church maybe that system has come into your life i don't know if you're ready to or not come on i said it's time to kill the witch it's time to kill that system that makes you rebel against god's word heal the system trying to keep you from every promise and blessing that god has given us you say brother where did you get that helmet somebody read it out loud now that's what a true prophet a true servant of god does how many times have you heard brother branham say that i am not against the church against the people nominations what we can do is cry out against it let's go on it was your decision after that dude every one of you has a decision to make this he said you'll serve the lord or not against his word why he says rebellion is as the we want to get somewhere we don't want to stick a sucker in your mouth and say oh everything's wonderful we're getting into the golden hour here isn't that when we get into trouble when we we go after strange things you're the one that troubles they had murdered neighbors they wanted his vineyard and then the word of the lord came hello first kings 21 19 and 23. remember this is the fulfillment of what exodus was saying and thou shalt speak unto him saying thus saith the lord hast thou killed and also taken possession and thou shalt speak unto him saying thus saith the lord in the place where dogs lick the blood of nabeth shall dogs lick thy blood even thine enough and of jezebel also speak the lord saying the dog shall eat jezebel by the wall of jezreel and it happened just exactly the way that the lord had spoken it through elijah the witch was killed and this modern-day jezebel system is read it in the book of revelation you've read it many times read it again this modern day jezebel system is coming to and gonna come to an end at one one of these days that's what we found in 1st samuel 28 9. this is what he had done verse 9. and the woman said unto him this is this is that witch of endor when he was he was trying to deceive her right not letting her know who he was what saul hath done what did saul do how he had cut off those that have familiar spirits and the wizards out of the land there's like one for saul good job saul point for you saul the bible says that in leviticus 20 verse 6 and the soul that turneth after such as have familiar spirits and after wizards to go a whoring after them i will even set my face against that soul and will cut him off from among the people i'm sorry so saul had rid the country of those with familiar spirits and wizards amen this is where people get into trouble out of desperation and impatience and less than 24 hours later leviticus 20 was fulfilled you can play around you can have your good time you young people you go out there it's a well we know we've seen those things happen in the old testament hermano i'm in a position to take care of you and and to feed you better than anyone hello everybody to whom they all gave heed from the least to the greatest saint this man is the great power of god as the story goes on then philip witnessed him in philippi he ended up he ended up getting baptized let me know what is understanding but watch in verse 18. but when simon saw the apostles lay hands and the holy spirit the holy ghost was given the gift and he tells a brother do you want to go i forget if it was hunting or fishing i think it was fishing and he says he said the brother says yeah yeah let's stop it i got to stop and and have a a council session with a brother he's impatient he gets his hat off he said it was a nice stetson hat i don't know he threw it on the ground and he kicked the hat and then he saw her brother brown was coming he picked up the hat many times it's not some great thing that needs to be done in the corner because i'm getting into my message it's not some great some big thing that needs to be done sometimes maybe just an upgrade to our system system on your phones and it tells you uh upgrade available on the tenacious i don't know when i can get this upgrade put things in the spiritual sentence because those things become so important and we we let it go we let it go and finally you're forced to yeah will not function until you do this maybe i can forward the calls he says that happens but maybe like our phones we're just not in sync with the right tower you know when you when you're when you're out they close to the border last saturday right before the time change we're very close to the arizona border we're an hour behind right until we change in the fall then we same as them you're because you're getting some cell service from pasta across the way so then you say oh shoot i thought it was this late and then we the phones and then they're updated you go to a certain place and then you gain signal you know what we're keeping calls maybe it's time to clear them out update our services let's update our system we don't have the wrong system but maybe it just needs to be updated when you look at it and you see the difference in time maybe it's the lord telling you he says he says you better know what time it is because when you keep putting one foot in the world and one foot in church two different systems there are many that live our their lives as if the lord's coming is a long way away it's often a distance somewhere established later than iglesias we've heard that for a long time it's still later than you think and the holy spirit told me to tell you this you can take it if you want to that the time on their clocks make sure that it reads exactly the same as mine now this is what this is where i get the inspiration from this message this is i said lord sometimes it seems like maybe i'm maybe i miss a few things that i'm supposed to be doing is there something lord that i'm missing or i'm overlooking your case i don't want to find out at the end that i missed this or missed that are there things that show me tell me what i need to do i want to please you more than anything else i finished saying what i had to say i continued to drive and i went up this little hill and all of a sudden here comes a truck right behind me i kind of turned around to look to see who it is it was one of the ranchers looking up at the and so so i i need to make sure that everything's functioning right the more he talks to me the more i hear the lord answering my prayers said if the lord could speak to balaam through a donkey speak to me through yeah he said well i'd come to check because the water's flowing really well it's actually overflowing but i'm gonna have to make some adjustments here now he's got my attention he said i i knew i got to make some changes here now now here's the thing is is that i'm up here to do that but do you hear that noise what is that i hear the air coming out of my tire i'm going to have to change that tire and i said i'll help you change it this is when i knew beyond a shadow of a doubt somebody do that and it was the lord speaking he looked at me and he said no he said this is your goal would a rancher be telling me this is my golden hour he walked away what is this golden hour this is this is my golden hour and when he says that to me he's talking about the church this is our golden hour there's just some some tweaks we got to make made up of 60 minutes significance in prophecy significance in prophecy and i noticed that the word is only found in one book in the old testament can anybody tell me what that is i didn't know until i looked it up don't anyone want to give it a gift what book is the word is it in what book but what book of the old testament i said i didn't know either no it's only found in the book of death why because it tells you the beginning and the ending of the gentile dispensation think about this the jews were given an exact amount of time foreign he's breaking it down to us gentiles he's breaking it down two different things and i was saying lord just just i this is i know it's from you yo and then i hear brother branham saying can you meet the challenge of the day but let's break it down who's going to meet the challenge these men these apostles these great men of god they met the challenge of the day it but was the holy spirit tells me meet the challenge of the hour all the way down now he's breaking it down and here's brother branham in the message just once more lord pakistan knew one thing and i wonder if the church realizes it today is a backsplitting condition with these denominations you're pulling good i can feel it your intellectual strength doesn't meet the challenge of the hours i wouldn't notice it so many ministers are on the on the on the theological side of the message everything i just explain every detail no split controller lost what it is you receive the holy ghost your intellectual strength doesn't meet the challenge of the hour that nothing can dare challenge the john 11 9 says what is done with the night hours jesus then says jesus what's the hour now i'm talking i'm i'm going from the system the system has a time follow me now here here it is now now he says he says can you not pray with me one hour no point can we not giving give the lord one hour oh no i'm a busy man oh no he's not a busy woman busy woman okay there has never been a day like today where time is so mismanaged oh come on you got to come with me now i'm sorry i mean it's not even just to young people it's even the old people all day long the system does not let you manage your time it's very challenging to get time alone the people rarely get time in which they're focused when's the last time you set some time aside and you're really focused okay i'm ready to read my bible now here you rarely get time or you're focused and undistracted consider what is constantly tugging at you all right i want you to consider this more what's tugging at you i don't care you cannot even get a text message leave it alone for oh i'll look at it this evening sometime no right away it's prompting it's tugging at you right away answer me answer me the with all these things is that they are all other people's priorities that has you spellbound oh foolishness of the lord what are you doing with the hours jesus said there's 12 hours wow what a thing he's saying brother branham uses this he's talking about ours and we've experienced all of them especially the hour of fear brother branham says power of confusion distress this morning what the hour is you're looking on your clock god's timepiece that hour is not talking about seconds or or hours or minutes in that sense when god's prophetic time comes to pass but he knew that god promised to bring them out with a strong hand and then when the hour of the time of the promised brunei pharaoh who knew not joseph jose this is god's system this is god's time peace when or the hour because he could come for you young people be prepared whatever god wants to do here oh my goodness mark 14 says my soul is exceedingly sorrowful and to death and he went a little forward and fell on the ground and prayed and said if it were possible that the hour might pass from him he goes on in john 17. i'm just going to i'm just going to go through this real quick he says father the hour is the hour is at hand matthew 26 and the son of man is betrayed into the hands of sinners it's the hour that's calling out did you get that i'm going to say it again it's the hour of the calling out there's darkness over egypt but before the calling out was applied for the church to get but i'm under the right system i want to be under your system in the church apostles teachers you gave a prophet first with a message why don't the people want what the what the message has produced there are false apostles prophets but in the midst of it i was going to ask for the pianist but then i'd have to go reach the but whatsoever you become but probably brother brother will you you know what the golden hour is right it's in photography it is the last hour before sunset and it's the first hour right after sunrise i didn't know that but that's what it is you can catch images and the details that you've never seen an hour before the sun goes down the church is so broke up and then the mysteries of god would be declared seventh angel begins to sound his message not the healing service what everybody focused on it's not the healing services is there any hope left esperanza we've got to do something and do it quickly that's for today we got to do something we got to do it quickly for the hour of the rapture your i want you to raise your hand this morning because he says here you're coming out of there there ain't no excuse to be in the wrong system anymore you that are sick faith in god have faith cause this is the hour of your healing believe now with all your heart is the 60 minutes following an injury or a trunk that if you don't get medical attention the time that will determine what will happen it's very critical well i've been hurt brother we've only got an hour not 60 minutes the golden hour is not just for traumatic situations but the first hour such as a heart attack or stroke medical attention has a profound impact on a person's survival take it to them at least 50 of all fat fatalities if the victims really even though they say it's an hour okay sometimes 20 to 30 minutes once again this is your golden yes but it only lasts 30 minutes that's right we are the people of the half hour of silence ah i'm going to say that again did you get that i'm going to say it again we are the people will take place i love that i'm going to say it again the don't don't come out to help me no no this is your golden estas and i say this morning arise and shine easy for the light has come in the glory of the lord we've we've preached may god bless his word amen come on everybody come on everybody if you ever heard
