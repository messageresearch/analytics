[33:48] family
[34:35] amen
[34:36] but the title of the message is
[34:38] brotherly love
[34:44] how many know what brotherly love is
[34:54] we're going to start with the scripture
[34:58] i'm not used to this and having the way
[34:59] to me to put the mic up i'm sorry
[35:01] brothers
[35:03] psalms 119.
[35:08] we're going to read verses 104 and 105.
[35:14] first we're going to go into a little
[35:15] bit what a lamp
[35:17] is
[35:21] what is the lamp
[35:24] amen amen
[35:26] and it's very simple here seems it is
[35:28] simple but it's
[35:29] tremendous right brother no we simply i
[35:32] keep it
[35:32] we tremendous let's start with verse 104
[35:38] through your
[35:39] precepts i get understanding therefore i
[35:43] hate every false
[35:45] way
[35:54] your word is a lamp unto my feet and as
[35:58] a light and to my path
[36:07] dear lord jesus we just thank you lord
[36:10] jesus
[36:12] for this grand prix to be before your
[36:15] children
[36:23] we thank you lord jesus
[36:46] so how does it say noah in spanish verse
[36:49] 5
[36:51] 105 yeah 105
[37:00] and the grammar it says it what we would
[37:03] call in reverse order
[37:05] in the way we said in english
[37:12] in english
[37:13] in spanish gram it's just the opposite
[37:15] that's why we can't sometimes just say a
[37:17] sentence
[37:18] this straight the way it is in english
[37:19] it doesn't make sense
[37:25] and a lot of times to the way the
[37:26] grammar is in spanish
[37:34] how the saying goes
[37:38] it gives it a little more flavor
[37:45] right lamb
[37:46] and to me
[37:48] es du
[37:50] is your word wow so first of all what's
[37:53] the lamp we're talking about
[37:58] the word
[38:00] okay now let's turn to matthew 25.
[38:07] and for right now we're just going to
[38:08] read the first
[38:10] four verses and you know what this is
[38:12] talking about right
[38:17] how many want to be wise virgins puentos
[38:20] quieren said uh virgines prudentes how
[38:23] many want to be foolish virgins
[38:26] in sensatas
[38:28] i'll leave it to you there okay hello
[38:32] then shall the kingdom of heaven be
[38:34] likened unto ten virgins
[38:37] which took
[38:38] their lamps
[38:40] and went forth to meet the bridegroom
[38:43] entonces el reyno de lucia
[38:58] but they took
[39:17] and five of them were wise and five were
[39:20] foolish
[39:26] they that were foolish took their lamps
[39:29] and took no oil
[39:31] with them
[39:37] notice how it says
[39:40] they took their laps but they took no
[39:42] oil with them
[39:48] what does the word emmanuel mean
[39:51] significant
[39:53] god
[40:08] he has to be with you
[40:12] amen i'm in so they took their lamps
[40:15] they had their words their word
[40:19] but they took no oil with them
[40:22] but now notice the difference
[40:26] in the wise version in in
[40:28] prudente
[40:29] and the wise took oil
[40:32] in their vessels
[40:36] with their laps
[40:45] you notice how it said in spanish
[40:49] it's it's a little container as we heard
[40:52] from brother sammy
[40:53] a reserve right
[40:58] now they just didn't have
[41:00] oil in the word that they had
[41:17] and at the end of this message we will
[41:18] see what that vessel is we have a lot of
[41:22] ideas
[41:26] and they're fine many of them are very i
[41:28] have some too yo
[41:31] very good maybe but we're going to find
[41:33] out what
[41:35] takes the first part of psalms
[41:39] 119 105.
[41:41] thy word is a lap into my feet
[41:51] notice i'm going to see how it goes from
[41:54] that comma then there's a comma there
[41:59] that means time
[42:01] a significant
[42:02] oh you you gotta that that light that's
[42:05] gonna come to your path it's not just
[42:07] gonna come like
[42:09] like that
[42:12] there's gonna be time that goes by
[42:21] but then that same word it says ants
[42:24] there's something that's going to join
[42:25] with it is
[42:46] now based on what i just said i believe
[42:48] this person that's got this far vasado
[42:51] and lo
[42:55] esta este punto i believe this person is
[42:57] born again
[43:00] how many are born again
[43:05] maybe
[43:06] [Music]
[43:07] oh my let's try again
[43:10] again
[43:24] he said
[43:36] putting your thinking caps on
[43:49] and here it's talking about the seven
[43:52] churches and so forth
[43:54] iglesias i would recommend that you read
[43:57] the whole chapter
[44:01] i'm measuring on these lamps
[44:07] verse 20 the mystery of the seven stars
[44:10] which you saw in my right hand
[44:13] and the seven golden candlesticks
[44:16] the seven stars are the angels or
[44:19] messengers the greek word there is
[44:22] earthly
[44:23] messenger
[44:26] angels
[44:27] and the seven stars are the angels of
[44:29] the seven churches and the seven
[44:31] candlesticks
[44:33] which you saw
[44:34] are the seven churches
[44:45] los angeles
[45:02] notice here in english it uses the word
[45:04] candlestick
[45:05] in english
[45:08] have you ever been in a wedding where
[45:10] they put
[45:12] this lamp stand with and they put seven
[45:15] candles on it and i don't know
[45:24] now let me see somebody that has done
[45:26] this before do they put a match to every
[45:29] one of those seven our opponent
[45:38] they get that one they like the second
[45:40] second one iconessa
[45:42] segunda they put the first one back
[45:44] regression they pick up the second one
[45:47] that's got light
[45:50] fourth fifth sixth and seven
[45:56] let's go to zechariah
[46:13] in the person
[46:16] you you can't be a lamp until you can
[46:18] reflect light nope
[46:21] but you have a vessel that needs to be
[46:23] filled
[46:26] before
[46:30] amen
[46:31] so
[46:32] zechariah four verse two sacrifices
[46:36] and he said unto me what sees thou
[46:39] and i said i have looked and behold a
[46:42] candlestick of gold
[46:44] with a bowl upon the top of it
[46:47] and it's seven lamps there on
[46:50] and seven pipes to the seven lamps which
[46:54] are upon the top thereof so go ahead and
[46:56] give me the picture there well we'll
[46:58] just read that one verse
[47:05] what we're talking about
[47:16] so it's not a candle stick like we think
[47:18] where you put a candle on it
[47:29] and you see how it all connects together
[47:34] it's more like a lamp stand or in
[47:45] so
[47:46] the seven churches then are represented
[47:48] here
[47:50] uh
[48:17] or do you pertain to one of the seven
[48:20] church ages
[48:24] the foolish virgin had a lamp
[48:29] and she knew which church age she was in
[48:58] i want you to notice here these first
[48:59] four verses that we read estos primeros
[49:02] cuatro versiculos they said the wise had
[49:04] oil and the foolish didn't have oil
[49:10] it's a declaration of god's
[49:13] foreknowledge is a declaration
[49:23] this is what's going to happen from now
[49:26] on to the coming of the lord
[49:36] that each of these seven church ages is
[49:40] going to produce
[49:54] talking about the body right established
[50:04] from now until the coming of the lord
[50:06] how many understand that this is
[50:10] you got
[50:20] while the bridegroom carried they all
[50:23] slumbered and slept
[50:32] a lot of people try to connect the first
[50:34] four verses with verse five and they
[50:36] just don't understand it
[50:51] he's seeing how these ages go by
[50:56] brother rem says it in 10 versions in
[50:58] 144 000.
[51:03] and they live out their age
[51:05] of events with us
[51:07] finished their purpose on earth
[51:12] and they go on to be
[51:14] ivana uh
[51:17] and brother branham says that verse five
[51:19] is
[51:25] so now you begin to see the time that
[51:28] he's talking about
[51:33] is he talking about you establish your
[51:35] stance how many believe he's talking
[51:37] about you want to scream establish death
[51:39] try to watch that clock i'm doing good
[51:41] so far
[51:45] watch now
[51:48] here from between verse five and six
[51:50] comes a complete change
[51:53] of age
[51:58] and it brings us all the way that to the
[52:01] time
[52:16] he
[52:24] and how he showed the eclipse of each
[52:26] age he took the the moon and the
[52:30] eclipse electricity
[52:32] which of the seven eclipses
[52:35] was a total blackout juan de la siete
[52:43] all
[52:44] right well how is it did it get any
[52:48] light then entonces
[52:51] loose yeah amen amen now brother ben
[52:54] said about 1977.
[52:59] people can get all critical about that
[53:00] all they want
[53:05] i couldn't see past 1997 of night yeah
[53:08] 1977 excuse me no no
[53:11] no no
[53:17] then i didn't know how anybody could
[53:19] live in a condition like that
[53:24] but who put that little bit of light in
[53:26] there
[53:35] [Music]
[53:38] so that there wouldn't be total darkness
[53:40] for
[53:54] is
[54:08] if you have a portion
[54:23] out the pastor's light in that essence
[54:29] we have a life
[54:32] comes through him he's the candlestick
[54:36] we don't want god to ever remove that no
[54:38] no no no no
[54:42] we don't want god to ever remove that no
[54:44] no
[54:46] no god ever did that that would show
[54:48] something real bad
[54:57] but that's not going to happen if we
[54:58] stay with the words
[55:02] we gather it says it gathers more all
[55:05] along and makes that body of the pillar
[55:08] of fire
[55:10] yes
[55:12] so it starts off as a little light
[55:15] and that little light
[55:18] is what's going to help
[55:20] fill that vessel
[55:25] that's what's going to convert the word
[55:28] being a lamp onto my feet
[55:36] and like unto my path
[55:40] can you put up the
[55:42] picture for me the other stature the
[55:44] church ages and the statue of the
[55:45] perfect man
[56:00] you
[56:15] below that we have what justification
[56:18] sanctification baptism of the holy
[56:20] spirit
[56:21] is justification
[56:24] and then the prophet says when you get
[56:26] that you barely have faith
[56:43] now becomes a light and to your path
[56:49] from the bottom
[56:51] from the time of the apostles
[56:55] all the way to the time of brotherly
[56:57] kindness
[57:00] i'm not going to go into the colors
[57:04] that's what peter says
[57:06] robert branham said brotherly love
[57:09] hermano
[57:13] now i didn't give this quote to you all
[57:16] up there
[57:18] but it's out of discernment of spirit
[57:22] of spiritus
[57:24] i would rather see brotherly love
[57:26] existing
[57:29] existed i like the way he says that
[57:33] in other words it's not just something
[57:34] that's here and then it leaves and when
[57:36] we feel good we're nice we love one
[57:38] another and we love the people that come
[57:42] in
[57:43] i like that expression i would rather
[57:45] see brotherly love existing
[57:50] the church
[57:52] if we didn't
[57:59] and then people take that out of context
[58:01] and say see so if somebody doesn't get
[58:03] healed in the surface
[58:04] if the holy ghost doesn't come down
[58:18] amen
[58:18] amen praise the living god
[58:23] let's go back to the
[58:25] our
[58:26] photo there
[58:28] so
[58:30] you get up to brotherly kindness
[58:34] more fraternal what age was that
[58:37] pertaining to aqueduct
[58:43] what does the word
[58:45] mean
[58:48] anybody that's a simple
[59:02] oh
[59:18] a little problem happens among a brother
[59:21] or sister or among family um
[59:29] i've only been at this over 35 years
[59:45] is way up here oh man
[59:49] love one another
[59:51] we can put up one another with one
[59:53] another
[59:55] little crazy like me
[59:58] locos and everything is fine
[1:00:02] and then other times our brotherly love
[1:00:04] is way down here
[1:00:08] problem happens between two families
[1:00:10] especially when the young people get to
[1:00:12] where they're going to start dating
[1:00:14] problems
[1:00:21] i don't want to get into pastor's place
[1:00:25] but all i can say is i've been
[1:00:53] god bless you sister i love you
[1:00:58] then it doesn't work
[1:01:03] like if the person doesn't even exist
[1:01:44] you know
[1:01:45] i respect the name of hill your
[1:01:47] respected
[1:01:48] hill
[1:01:50] hill but i i look at my brother julian
[1:01:53] hermano julian i see more than a hill
[1:01:56] velmasque un hill
[1:02:00] i see the blood of jesus
[1:02:04] christ i see
[1:02:12] i might get in trouble for this one
[1:02:15] problem
[1:02:16] we need to get over the last name
[1:02:18] syndrome
[1:02:23] if your buddy buddy was so-and-so that
[1:02:25] has the last name of this then you're in
[1:02:27] the end
[1:02:29] amigos
[1:02:32] but maybe you don't quite understand
[1:02:34] that other person so then you're the out
[1:02:38] on a person oh you've never felt like
[1:02:40] that before huh
[1:02:46] this has happened over more no probably
[1:02:48] closer to 40 years right
[1:02:52] but now let's
[1:02:53] focus here
[1:02:56] so we want our bill why do we want our
[1:02:58] brother love to be at such a high level
[1:03:11] now the only thing i don't see in
[1:03:13] between the top of the pyramid and
[1:03:17] the bright age are love
[1:03:24] what's your other photos
[1:03:27] the prophet puts holy spirit
[1:03:33] so you have to have all this and light
[1:03:36] until your path all the way to the top
[1:03:42] but then when you get to brotherly love
[1:03:44] if you truly have brotherly love
[1:03:49] then the holy spirit unites it with the
[1:03:52] headstones
[1:03:57] now just before we go back to matthew
[1:03:59] 25.
[1:04:03] how many really enjoyed that message on
[1:04:04] wednesday
[1:04:08] message of grace the twin sisters
[1:04:24] orthodox church
[1:04:25] israel
[1:04:26] orthodox he says that in one place
[1:04:30] another place he's saying is the church
[1:04:32] coming into existence brother branham
[1:04:34] says
[1:04:36] this is like iglesia
[1:04:38] existencia
[1:04:53] and she's in the headstone esta en la
[1:04:56] piedra de corona my goodness
[1:04:58] i just loved it so much
[1:05:02] zechariah four zakarias cuatro
[1:05:09] where it says
[1:05:11] let's go to verse six vamos a verso says
[1:05:14] we're eventually going to get to the
[1:05:15] rock box we're doing good
[1:05:20] then he answered and spake unto me
[1:05:22] saying
[1:05:23] this is the word of the lord unto
[1:05:25] zerubbabel saying not by my nor by power
[1:05:28] but by my spirit saith the lord of hosts
[1:05:32] responding
[1:05:46] great mountain put them out well let's
[1:05:47] put the mountain back up and i'll just
[1:05:48] read it
[1:05:52] amen
[1:05:55] before zerubbabel
[1:05:57] amen
[1:06:01] this great mountain is
[1:06:10] thank the lord jesus christ
[1:06:13] jesus
[1:06:14] let me finish reading it here
[1:06:19] oh and you look at that and you think
[1:06:21] you say i gotta get all the way up there
[1:06:23] to make it in the rapture
[1:06:25] okay
[1:06:42] in order to make the rapture well
[1:06:45] that's looking at it in the corner ways
[1:06:48] because the only reason we can go up
[1:06:50] this great mountain
[1:06:54] is because we're already in the rapture
[1:06:59] the lord himself shall descend with a
[1:07:02] shout out
[1:07:06] message of preparation
[1:07:08] amen let's get in let's pick it up right
[1:07:11] here then
[1:07:16] verse 7 who art thou o great mountain
[1:07:20] before zerubbabel ye shall become a
[1:07:22] plane
[1:07:24] and he shall bring forth the headstone
[1:07:26] thereof
[1:07:41] anymore
[1:07:44] now this grace that's coming
[1:07:48] is producing shoutings and why did we
[1:07:51] hear a lot of it on wednesday producing
[1:07:54] this
[1:07:56] [Music]
[1:08:02] can you remember how many times i
[1:08:03] listened to that when i could listen to
[1:08:05] it
[1:08:07] but watch
[1:08:08] this crying
[1:08:15] well i got the figure up there but if
[1:08:17] you are are you following in your bibles
[1:08:20] with shouting of grace
[1:09:18] gracias
[1:09:32] but not just to hurt no solo
[1:09:35] but now this grace
[1:09:37] gracia this lamp that was the words
[1:09:42] just put that other back up there again
[1:10:14] now
[1:10:16] [Music]
[1:10:35] what do you think paul said be followers
[1:10:37] of me as i am of gamelgyo
[1:10:40] pablo di jose
[1:10:44] he was one of the most tremendous
[1:10:46] teachers
[1:10:46] saul ever sit under one of those
[1:10:48] maestros
[1:10:52] of me
[1:10:54] as i am of christ
[1:11:01] how many follow the christ of our pastor
[1:11:06] pastor well it's not just the crust of
[1:11:08] our pastor
[1:11:10] this
[1:11:23] and the nature and the character of a
[1:11:25] pastor
[1:11:29] not just a man that stands up and says
[1:11:31] he's something which he never does that
[1:11:32] no solo number
[1:11:40] are we happy so far
[1:11:43] now brothers i would like to go to that
[1:11:45] quote out of blasphemous names
[1:11:52] and i'm almost forgetting something here
[1:11:57] forget me up there i'm getting ahead of
[1:11:58] myself as usual
[1:12:01] let's go back to matthew 25.
[1:12:05] yes i wanted to hit on those from verse
[1:12:08] 5 you know
[1:12:13] but another three or four verses
[1:12:17] now in verse five we saw this the aegis
[1:12:19] went to sleep
[1:12:28] and at midnight there was a cry made
[1:12:30] behold the bridegroom comes
[1:12:33] go ye out you meet him
[1:12:49] in estrella he's not just seen this age
[1:12:54] he's seen the whole thing
[1:13:00] all the way till now
[1:13:02] that helps me understand a little bit
[1:13:04] hebrews 11 31.
[1:13:08] i could never understand before and
[1:13:09] there's no poliente that says having
[1:13:12] provided a better thing for them
[1:13:20] having provided a better thing for us
[1:13:39] so now when he starts to talk in the
[1:13:41] scripture here
[1:13:44] he's stuck in specifically to this time
[1:13:47] established
[1:13:51] he's speaking to leo
[1:13:53] established
[1:13:55] but not know
[1:13:56] and himself
[1:14:13] out
[1:14:14] into the bright age
[1:14:18] amen amen that's what who's talking to
[1:14:22] you now
[1:14:24] now notice how it seems like it changes
[1:14:26] i don't
[1:14:30] says the foolish virgin had no oil in
[1:14:32] her lap
[1:14:38] she didn't have any holy spirit in the
[1:14:41] word that she received nothing else
[1:14:46] god's spoken word of the original seed
[1:14:53] amen
[1:15:37] in her vessel
[1:15:41] praise the lord jesus
[1:15:44] watch this
[1:15:46] then all those virgins arose and trim
[1:15:48] their lamps
[1:15:50] verse 17
[1:15:55] and the foolish said to the wise
[1:15:58] give us of your oil
[1:16:01] for our lamps are gone
[1:16:03] out
[1:16:20] oh see how the scripture balances itself
[1:16:22] off
[1:16:25] what was the oil that ran out
[1:16:31] it's because she stayed in
[1:17:01] sound that's a little the loudest yeah
[1:17:03] this little light of mine
[1:17:05] can you lose mia i'm gonna let it shine
[1:17:08] oh yeah god
[1:17:10] we gotta let it shine yeah naked the
[1:17:12] numbers gonna be the light it's almost
[1:17:14] like loose
[1:17:31] but the wise answered in saying
[1:17:34] not so
[1:17:36] lest there being not enough for us and
[1:17:39] you
[1:17:40] but go rather to them that sell
[1:17:56] how many can say that you
[1:17:58] i don't i that scripture is hard to
[1:18:00] understand how many because if that's
[1:18:01] hard to understand
[1:18:08] go to them that cell arabian uh
[1:18:24] because you rejected the way that god
[1:18:28] wanted to give you that little light
[1:18:31] bring you out of leonis
[1:18:35] do it for yourselves
[1:19:08] but now i want to go to the rock box
[1:19:12] oh this is where it's going to get
[1:19:14] sticky
[1:19:17] amen rock it's called a blasphemy as
[1:19:19] names
[1:19:31] is talking about sister shepard
[1:19:33] established
[1:19:34] a shepherd
[1:19:48] ringing

[1:20:16] how many of you when you believe you

[1:20:21] you have that question about whether you
[1:20:23] receive the holy ghost
[1:20:27] you can say lord can you prove it to me
[1:20:33] let's put that up
[1:20:34] that picture done
[1:20:36] clear it up there again and then we'll
[1:20:37] go back to the description
[1:20:39] i'll have you bring that right back
[1:20:41] no
[1:20:44] what do you receive the holy ghost
[1:20:51] well brother right here well after i was
[1:20:53] justified sanctified i received
[1:20:57] the baptism of the holy ghost

[1:21:28] ghost
[1:21:30] baptism after baptism
[1:21:36] all the way to the top
[1:21:38] all the way to the consummation
[1:21:53] you received a new spirit
[1:22:10] and now you have
[1:22:12] a
[1:22:13] holy spirit
[1:22:17] not the holy spirit no at the top no el
[1:22:21] espirito santo questa
[1:22:41] amen amen
[1:22:43] praise the lord
[1:22:46] how many want baptism after baptism
[1:22:49] baltismore
[1:23:05] and i'd forgotten
[1:23:10] oh there's honey in the rock for all you
[1:23:12] and me
[1:23:15] okay blasphemous names
[1:23:18] back to that
[1:23:21] because i spoke with tongs and
[1:23:23] we believe in all that but
[1:23:25] have i really got it
[1:23:32] and after this resistance when she had
[1:23:34] this dream
[1:23:37] paragraph
[1:23:38] 102 through 104.
[1:23:42] and she dreamed she was up on a mountain
[1:23:45] yes
[1:23:50] the best i haven't got the paper before
[1:23:52] me but
[1:23:53] uh then like this she dreams she saw a
[1:23:56] rock box
[1:24:05] my husband was just behind her and she
[1:24:07] saw a large man standing there
[1:24:10] with work
[1:24:11] clothes on
[1:24:14] established
[1:24:29] the most pure
[1:24:31] water that she'd ever seen
[1:24:38] pouring it into this box
[1:24:41] this rock box is
[1:24:55] and this rock box would not hold the
[1:24:58] water
[1:25:01] and it rolled out of there and just
[1:25:04] boiled up all the trash and sticks and
[1:25:06] everything
[1:25:53] throw all the way back to the beginning
[1:25:54] of the statue of a perfect man
[1:26:00] at the bottom of the mountain and looked
[1:26:02] back what did she look back
[1:26:04] [Music]
[1:26:18] she was wanting to know where she was
[1:26:36] amen she turned and went down she
[1:26:38] stopped in the bottom and looked back
[1:26:40] she saw five streams
[1:26:43] of this pure
[1:26:45] crystal water
[1:26:46] not contaminated by the things
[1:27:02] have you been contaminated by the things
[1:27:04] you've been you passed
[1:27:07] i'm not saying you have no they go see
[1:27:10] sometimes we get a little dirty
[1:27:13] we have an advocate
[1:27:19] watch this
[1:27:20] in the crystal water not contaminated by
[1:27:22] the things that had went
[1:27:25] large crystalline it went through no
[1:27:27] contamination
[1:27:30] coming swiftly
[1:27:39] and she was wondering would it ever
[1:27:42] reach the bottom of the mountain
[1:28:10] and she says will it ever get to in
[1:28:12] other words will it ever get to me
[1:28:17] amen
[1:28:18] let's go to the next paragraph brothers
[1:28:22] paragraph 121 through 124. now i'm
[1:28:24] reading a lot
[1:28:29] so therefore the rock the latter-day
[1:28:31] pentecostal church which has received
[1:28:33] the holy spirit
[1:28:36] like they did it first
[1:28:40] of
[1:28:45] all down to the ages they receive the
[1:28:47] holy spirit but not in the measure they
[1:28:50] have it now
[1:29:09] how they lit that first candle and it
[1:29:11] went higher and higher and got dimmer
[1:29:14] and dimmer then come back again see
[1:29:16] first and last and so forth
[1:29:18] candles
[1:29:35] the message is
[1:29:50] is being poured into the church
[1:29:55] but the church body itself all together
[1:29:58] like the el cuerpo de lectres
[1:30:02] next paragraph
[1:30:04] paragraph
[1:30:11] now here's where it gets down to ability
[1:30:12] love and some of the things some of our
[1:30:14] ideas
[1:30:34] you're this tabernacle right
[1:30:35] now our church's tabernacles right
[1:30:40] this tabernacle is not a holy ghost
[1:30:42] tabernacle
[1:30:46] there is no such a thing no existed
[1:30:51] individuals that come into this church
[1:30:54] is holy ghost
[1:30:56] tabernacles individuals
[1:31:00] the spiritual sun they are tabernacles
[1:31:03] that contain the holy ghost
[1:31:08] but not the church
[1:31:10] in the uh the body a group
[1:31:13] no neglect
[1:31:15] and watch how he types this with her
[1:31:16] dream where the water almost didn't make
[1:31:19] it
[1:31:23] therefore it runs out
[1:31:28] why because we think that just by coming
[1:31:32] here pensamos and solo veniraqi
[1:31:35] that we're a holy ghost tabernacle yes
[1:31:39] right the holy ghost is here it is
[1:31:42] he wants to be tabernacled
[1:31:56] the messenger to the church
[1:32:00] pouring the message into the church
[1:32:04] but what's the water doing
[1:32:07] it was boiling out all the trash that
[1:32:10] was in it
[1:32:22] now paragraph 129 and 130 and we'll
[1:32:25] finish reading that
[1:32:29] so much that she come down here down the
[1:32:32] hill to the bottom
[1:32:34] of the hill
[1:32:38] now this glorious water was gushing over
[1:32:40] the hills
[1:32:47] in five streams in cinco arroyos now
[1:32:50] five is the number of grace
[1:33:30] where when it gets so high it's
[1:33:33] before it becomes five streams
[1:33:35] it's one stream
[1:33:39] then it split into five minutes let's go
[1:33:41] back now to the rock box
[1:33:44] and there's more quotes but i don't want
[1:33:45] to read it because i'm at 55 minutes
[1:33:55] so in her dream when she saw that this
[1:33:57] rock box wouldn't hold the water in
[1:34:11] [Music]
[1:34:15] why won't this rock box hold the water
[1:34:18] or
[1:34:19] quest
[1:34:22] and what was the rock box
[1:34:25] it was your rock confession
[1:34:28] the same confession that peter made
[1:34:44] she was
[1:34:58] water for no contagion agua then the
[1:35:01] same messenger gets a big bucket of
[1:35:03] honey el mensahiro este mis moments
[1:35:13] and then he um to pour the water back in
[1:35:15] it
[1:35:17] regressed
[1:35:19] and that's when it started to fill up
[1:35:21] and hold the water yeah
[1:35:24] it wasn't just coming out of the seams
[1:35:53] it
[1:35:54] is fair the doctrine of the apostles and
[1:35:57] prophets
[1:35:59] and she was wondering what that water
[1:36:01] get to where she was at
[1:36:06] to us to many of us that water has
[1:36:08] reached us
[1:36:20] to the pastor our founding pastor on
[1:36:22] wednesday
[1:36:34] he says
[1:36:42] what is honey yes
[1:36:44] anybody tell me what honey is according
[1:36:46] to what we're reading
[1:36:50] what is the
[1:37:18] see if you can put it up there
[1:37:20] i don't know if you're able to get it up
[1:37:21] there
[1:37:23] there it is
[1:37:25] okay
[1:37:27] combined action or operation operation
[1:37:33] and what are the what is the result
[1:37:34] they're looking for yes
[1:37:38] cause it to work together
[1:37:43] what a pair together
[1:37:52] how many believe that's why our pastor
[1:37:53] tries so hard to get us to work together
[1:38:00] juntos
[1:38:02] the synergy
[1:38:04] now brother could you read the
[1:38:05] definition you have in english and i'll
[1:38:07] translate it to spanish because it opens
[1:38:09] up i didn't give this to you but thank
[1:38:10] you go ahead it says to produce a
[1:38:13] combined effect greater
[1:38:19] than the sum of their separate effects
[1:38:25] apart
[1:38:31] now
[1:38:32] honey
[1:38:34] has healing properties
[1:38:39] how many know you can take honey for
[1:38:40] this and they cut in especially if it's
[1:38:42] virgin honey right
[1:38:47] they have a saying about honey we know
[1:38:49] it's not exactly true but it's just
[1:38:52] saying
[1:38:56] it says that it has an eternal
[1:38:59] almost an eternal shelf life
[1:39:05] we know it's not eternal we know what
[1:39:07] the word eternal means right
[1:39:10] it just doesn't
[1:39:30] and it takes
[1:39:32] this example the prophet gives it in
[1:39:33] like four or five minutes
[1:39:38] this pastor has a sick sheep
[1:39:44] and he wants it to lick the limestone he
[1:39:47] has in his little pocket
[1:39:54] now that sheep is not going to just lick
[1:39:56] that
[1:39:57] sour
[1:39:59] ugly tasting limestone
[1:40:31] now does he just lick it off until he
[1:40:33] gets the limestone because you don't
[1:40:34] like the taste of the limestone
[1:40:40] but it combines it it takes
[1:40:43] some of the lime perotoma apart
[1:40:46] starts to combine it with the honey it's
[1:40:48] a combination
[1:41:01] now let's put our picture back up and
[1:41:02] we'll finish
[1:41:05] and we'll go to our next our last vote
[1:41:12] this rock box is
[1:41:15] at the top of the pyramid river
[1:41:29] we have the holy ghost with elijah
[1:41:30] what's the holy ghost is actually
[1:41:32] between there tenement
[1:41:38] study history brother hector you know
[1:41:40] more about this than i do yes
[1:41:42] and many of you that were in the
[1:41:44] apostolic church
[1:41:47] what really destroyed overall the
[1:41:50] pentecostal movement
[1:41:56] why did they divide into so many little
[1:41:58] isms and clicks
[1:42:04] because they lost brotherly love
[1:42:08] fraternal they had different ideas they
[1:42:10] had no honey differences
[1:42:16] do you think it'll be any different why
[1:42:18] do you think and we're not throwing at
[1:42:20] nobody
[1:42:23] tell us never to do this
[1:42:38] why so many churches in the message
[1:42:50] instead of having brotherly love embezza
[1:42:53] tenera more fraternal and sit down and
[1:42:56] cry out to god
[1:43:00] and bring in the honey
[1:43:03] until god can come down into the honey
[1:43:51] we should be like sister shepard
[1:43:54] a shepherd can you confirm it to me
[1:43:59] i gotta know for sure
[1:44:04] she
[1:44:14] he was such a loving person he would
[1:44:16] invite brothers into her home
[1:44:24] last quote out of the conflict between
[1:44:27] god and satan and that's i'll be done

[1:44:50] my word is a lamp and to my feet
[1:44:57] a light unto my path

[1:45:05] read this thomas
[1:45:08] is this fire
[1:45:11] was wanting a confirmation
[1:45:14] watch this fire is the confirmation that
[1:45:17] the lights

[1:45:28] quebec yes because thy word is a lamp
[1:45:32] and to my feet
[1:45:35] it's this light that's coming this fire
[1:45:37] that's coming

[1:46:31] amen god is the word the oil is the holy
[1:46:34] spirit
[1:46:36] and the fire is the gospel light on that
[1:46:40] oil

[1:46:45] striving to get people to receive the
[1:46:48] holy ghost
[1:47:07] way to make me walk correctly
[1:47:12] spirit
[1:47:13] the fire is the gospel light of that oil

[1:47:34] that and it
[1:48:02] was on the outside estaba fuera had no
[1:48:05] oil

[1:48:09] in laodicea
[1:48:11] and they couldn't reflect nothing but
[1:48:14] just their church nopodian
