[46:14] god bless you
[46:15] brother diego
[46:17] brother brother
[46:20] it is a pleasure to be able to greet
[46:22] each and every one emilio perez brother
[46:24] emilio perez
[46:36] to be able to stand before the bride of
[46:38] the lord jesus christ
[46:54] waking up to reality
[46:57] with a subtitle how can i overcome this
[47:02] waking to reality
[47:07] we have to wake up to reality
[47:16] and i would like to read another
[47:17] scripture
[47:18] says yes in ephesians chapter 6 verse
[47:21] 10.
[47:37] put on the whole armor of god that you
[47:39] may be able to stand against the wiles
[47:42] of the devil
[47:56] where we wrestle not against flesh and
[47:57] blood but against principalities against
[48:00] powers against the rulers of the
[48:02] darkness of this world against spiritual
[48:05] wickedness in high places
[48:16] wherefore take unto you the whole armor
[48:18] of god that you may be able to withstand
[48:21] in the evil day and having done all to
[48:24] stand
[48:25] firm
[48:32] stand therefore having your loins gird
[48:34] about with truth and having on the
[48:37] breastplate of righteousness
[48:42] and your feet shod with the preparation
[48:44] of the gospel of peace
[48:52] above all take the shield of faith
[48:55] where ye
[48:56] wherewith you shall be able to quench
[48:58] all the fiery darts of the wicked
[49:03] [Music]
[49:06] here it's giving us the armor of god
[49:11] and it says that we wrestle we fight
[49:23] the armor that the scriptures are giving
[49:25] us
[49:27] there's something special about them
[49:32] because when we speak about the armor of
[49:34] god
[49:38] automatically we think that we are going
[49:40] to attack
[49:42] pero
[49:52] it speaks more about about armor up for
[49:54] defense instead of to attack
[50:08] all this is to protect us
[50:12] to be able to have a defense system
[50:16] where he gives us to attack is the sword
[50:18] la spada the sword
[50:21] that's what he gives us
[50:23] for attack to attack
[50:38] what is the purpose
[51:21] how can there be trials
[51:26] in reality it's strange
[51:34] in this day and age of abundance and
[51:35] opportunity
[51:39] when there is so much and so much to
[51:41] obtain
[51:46] with all these inventions that make
[51:47] things easier for us
[51:52] so many things to give us pleasure
[51:54] llamos
[51:58] we see these
[51:59] mental illnesses coming upon the people
[52:15] millions and millions of people are
[52:16] taking pills to be able to sleep at
[52:18] night
[52:23] and to wake up when they wake up in the
[52:24] morning they they take pills to give
[52:26] them more strength
[52:30] they are they are running to the doctors
[52:34] they are running to the mental
[52:35] institutes
[52:39] and there and with alcohol they they try
[52:43] to calm these things
[53:11] but they have less confidence
[53:16] in this day and age they talk about
[53:19] knowledge and and
[53:21] knowledge
[53:22] and science
[53:25] but they are losing the battle
[53:30] because
[53:35] the the the spirit and the soul of the
[53:37] of the humans
[53:40] came
[53:42] cannot comprehend these changes that are
[53:44] coming upon the earth
[53:49] and one generation we have advanced from
[53:51] the horse hastal esposito the horse and
[53:53] buggy to space
[54:07] that is crying now in torment
[54:21] and we can call this the date of the
[54:22] neurotics
[54:27] this age can be called the age of the
[54:29] narrative
[54:32] that is the age that we're in
[54:35] that is the age that we are fighting
[54:39] that is the time that we we
[54:42] how are we going to cristiano as
[54:44] christians
[54:47] to be able to overcome that day and age
[54:48] we live in
[55:04] the bible tells
[55:17] but by every word that proceedeth out of
[55:19] the mouth of god
[55:22] many times the devil comes and he wants
[55:24] to to change that
[55:25] he knows and he tells us
[55:29] shall not live by bread alone
[55:31] but by every word of god
[55:34] that's not with the scriptures
[55:40] every word that comes out of the mouth
[55:41] of god
[55:45] now we have to go and see what is
[56:16] and he is expressing his message
[56:19] there is not a man speaking
[56:24] speaking directly to us
[56:27] and he is
[56:41] now that we see that the mouth of god is
[56:43] a prophet proverbial
[56:46] proverbs 2 6 says
[56:49] because god gives wisdom
[56:52] and through his by his mouth
[56:54] through by his mouth
[56:56] by
[57:08] now this uh
[57:09] this word
[57:12] knowledge the puerto rico according to
[57:14] the dictionary significa conscience it
[57:17] means conscience
[57:21] or
[57:22] sense of reality
[57:24] what does
[57:38] it awakens
[57:52] he was over there was like
[57:54] he was doing the incorrect word
[57:57] when he got to the lowest part of his
[57:59] life
[58:04] the angel lord went to go look for him
[58:05] to see where he was
[58:48] so i'll
[59:01] in the middle of all this mental
[59:03] sickness
[59:05] in the middle of all this spiritual
[59:07] sickness
[59:11] and he awakened us to reality
[59:14] who we really are
[1:00:12] it doesn't matter the condition
[1:00:22] but i know i know who he is
[1:01:05] and the message is jesus christ is the
[1:01:07] same yesterday today and forever
[1:01:11] cuatro
[1:01:12] preached in 1954.
[1:01:16] the faith of the weakest poorest person
[1:01:19] in here tonight
[1:01:22] will bring jesus christ on the scene
[1:01:24] [Music]
[1:01:29] the faith of the weakest person
[1:01:32] will bring jesus on the scene
[1:01:35] because he is the savior
[1:02:33] those who are oppressed
[1:02:36] he is still we're searching for the loss
[1:02:39] he is the same thing as yesterday
[1:02:45] he has the same it don't change
[1:02:51] and the prophet says let me tell you
[1:02:55] elijah and his nerves on the edge
[1:03:02] on the edge anyhow i always felt sorry
[1:03:04] for him
[1:03:19] always felt sorry for him his now and
[1:03:21] that great
[1:03:22] pound from jezebel finished the stroke
[1:03:24] the then he run and went into the
[1:03:26] wilderness and laid under the juniper
[1:03:28] tree
[1:03:32] oh that experience of the juniper tree
[1:03:34] muchos
[1:03:38] there is many of us find ourselves under

[1:08:21] overcome in this day
[1:08:50] tengo olvio i have hate tengo rencor i
[1:08:54] have a
[1:08:55] bitterness
[1:08:58] i cannot see this person in the face
[1:09:01] because he did this and this to me
[1:09:03] [Music]
[1:09:04] i
[1:09:35] and this we have to make this personal
[1:09:37] man
[1:09:39] the prophet says
[1:09:45] now let us go another step
[1:09:50] but before we do let us review our case
[1:09:52] thus far
[1:09:58] first of all we
[1:10:00] we know most assuredly that the purpose
[1:10:02] of god stands an election
[1:10:08] a purpose it was purpose in himself
[1:10:12] it was god's purpose
[1:10:29] the foundation of the world
[1:10:31] she was for known for mother and beloved
[1:10:38] before she was ever brought forth during
[1:10:40] the ages upon the earth
[1:11:09] for the foundation
[1:13:57] if i cannot be lost i'm going to do
[1:13:58] whatever
[1:14:25] we have to understand who we are
[1:14:29] revelation the revelation spiritual
[1:14:31] spiritual revelation
[1:14:36] spiritual revelation doesn't come from
[1:14:37] what you see outside
[1:14:40] when jesus
[1:15:21] who do you say i am
[1:15:24] when that happened
[1:15:27] only one responded
[1:15:30] you are the christ
[1:15:33] the son of the living god
[1:15:36] you are the christ
[1:15:39] the son of the living god
[1:15:42] and when he understood that
[1:15:45] there comes a blessing
[1:15:49] and he said blessed are thou simon
[1:16:18] shall not prevail against them
[1:16:22] when peter tells jesus
[1:16:25] you are the christ the son of the living
[1:16:27] god
[1:16:29] it was by revelation
[1:16:31] and the prophet said
[1:17:27] on earth
[1:17:42] here on the
[1:18:42] [Applause]
[1:18:54] when jesus curses the fig tree
[1:18:58] so many people cite the scripture
[1:19:01] and they say
[1:19:04] that whosoever shall say unto this
[1:19:05] mountain
[1:19:22] many times that's the way the scripture
[1:19:23] is told to us
[1:19:26] but the scripture doesn't say exactly
[1:19:27] like that
[1:19:29] what the scripture says
[1:19:32] that whenever you would say
[1:19:48] those things which he had said
[1:19:51] in other words
[1:19:55] many times we can believe what the
[1:19:56] brother says
[1:19:59] we can believe what the pastor says
[1:20:27] [Music]
[1:20:53] [Music]
[1:20:54] who i really am
[1:21:21] the kind of dog you're gonna have to put
[1:21:22] in your yard
[1:21:41] oh but if you live in a good
[1:21:42] neighborhood you can put a little
[1:21:43] chihuahua
[1:21:47] we have to understand that
[1:21:51] we have to understand the date and the
[1:21:53] age we live in
[1:22:08] in this age that we live in
[1:22:11] and the prophet begins to clear uh to
[1:22:13] clear out these statements
[1:22:18] because him in the same manner of jesus
[1:22:20] christ
[1:22:50] comes and begins to clear out those
[1:22:52] forces and he says there is two powers
[1:22:57] god enabled god and satan
[1:23:02] and the prophet says and how the message
[1:23:04] how can i overcome political centrist
[1:23:07] preached in 1963.
[1:23:11] he says jesus told us how to do it
[1:23:14] elven
[1:23:15] he overcame
[1:23:16] even
[1:23:17] and to overcome significa means support
[1:23:22] you'll be able to
[1:23:26] stand the test
[1:23:28] significa
[1:23:31] stand the test
[1:23:59] in other words
[1:24:14] god how tremendous god we have almost
[1:24:16] stopped him everything is fine
[1:24:19] everything is perfect
[1:24:24] but when everything begins to get hard
[1:24:28] that is where
[1:24:52] [Music]
[1:24:58] you say father
[1:25:02] lord this trial that i have mentored
[1:25:04] it's hard but
[1:25:06] you said in your words
[1:25:38] these promises
[1:26:35] selective elective elective elective
[1:26:41] but he loves his bride so much
[1:26:44] he comes and gives her a test
[1:26:47] he gives her a trial purchase
[1:26:52] because you can just give them a taste
[1:26:54] of the suffering of jesus
[1:26:58] he saved it for the last time for his
[1:26:59] bride
[1:27:01] so she can
[1:27:02] struggle
[1:27:30] tell you
[1:27:33] if you are under attack of the enemy
[1:27:36] if the enemy has uh made you sick
[1:27:41] maybe you weren't depression
[1:27:43] and anxiety
[1:27:45] you have problems in your life
[1:27:51] if you are supporting the test standing
[1:27:53] the test
[1:27:54] you are an overcomer
[1:27:59] the the the storm is still still there
[1:28:04] the storm is still there like torment
[1:28:06] there is emotional storms
[1:28:09] spiritual storms
[1:28:12] a familiarized story
[1:28:15] financial storms
[1:28:21] you cannot see where it goes
[1:28:25] in phoenix one time there in phoenix
[1:28:39] there was light all over i didn't know
[1:28:42] where to go
[1:28:44] i didn't know where i was driving on the
[1:28:45] road
[1:28:46] i couldn't see nothing
[1:28:48] nothing
[1:28:51] and that's what happens when we're in
[1:28:52] the storm
[1:28:54] emotional
[1:30:04] there is a voice
[1:30:32] they have the both of them there to make
[1:30:34] the decision
[1:30:36] and the winner
[1:30:38] raise his hand
[1:30:46] that's why the devil doesn't want you to
[1:30:47] raise your hand
[1:30:49] he doesn't like you to worship god
[1:30:54] you're the trial raise your hand
[1:30:59] we have overcomers
[1:31:14] [Applause]
[1:31:43] you know one of the main reasons why
[1:31:44] there is depression amongst the youth
[1:31:47] the social media facebook facebook
[1:31:49] instagram instagram
[1:31:52] and all these other ones
[1:31:56] because if you try to compare themselves
[1:31:57] what they say
[1:32:00] so the majority of those things are
[1:32:01] false
[1:32:04] if they see a young person
[1:32:07] felicia and they say oh look at that
[1:32:08] family how happy
[1:32:24] nobody
[1:33:06] the hospital
[1:34:44] because when you begin
[1:34:58] enter
[1:35:40] the celestial
[1:36:08] there was nobody worthy
[1:36:11] to look upon the book
[1:36:15] you get to cry
[1:36:18] we get to cry
[1:36:21] because we know we are not worthy
[1:36:50] many

[1:39:52] don't
[1:40:06] and when he went to the
[1:40:20] and the prophet says
[1:41:31] out and he hits himself
[1:41:34] he wants to come out of the devil
[1:41:36] and he brings something he brings up

[2:05:09] we're going to do another engagement
[2:05:23] all right all right

[2:05:27] gabriel
[2:05:28] and sister marty
[2:05:31] come on up
[2:05:33] [Applause]
[2:05:43] hello doc
[2:05:48] hello brother gabriel
[2:05:50] i won't make this too difficult on you
[2:05:52] guys
[2:05:53] i actually took it easy on the brother
[2:05:54] and sister this morning
[2:05:57] because i i
[2:05:58] i did
[2:06:00] i did because i i don't know brother
[2:06:02] marcos very well but we but we will
[2:06:05] but i know brother gabe real well and
[2:06:09] and sister muddy
[2:06:12] and they're they're they're quite the
[2:06:14] couple
[2:06:16] you you guys decided you were going to
[2:06:17] take the round about
[2:06:19] way to do this but
[2:06:22] it finally came came around
[2:06:27] so we're grateful to god for that amen
[2:06:30] first corinthians the 13th chapter
[2:06:33] it tells us charity suffereth long
[2:06:37] and is kind
[2:06:39] charity envieth not
[2:06:42] charity vaunteth not itself
[2:06:45] is not puffed up
[2:06:47] does not behave itself unseemly
[2:06:51] seeketh not her own
[2:06:53] is not easily provoked
[2:06:55] thinketh no evil
[2:06:58] rejoices
[2:06:59] not in iniquity
[2:07:02] but rejoiceth in the truth
[2:07:05] beareth all things
[2:07:07] believeth all things
[2:07:09] hopeth all things
[2:07:11] endureth all things
[2:07:14] charity
[2:07:16] love
[2:07:17] never faileth
[2:07:20] so we
[2:07:21] are grateful to to the lord
[2:07:24] for that the prophet of god says
[2:07:28] says this now keep those things in mind
[2:07:32] the church must believe every word
[2:07:35] every promise
[2:07:36] every iota
[2:07:38] and claim it for themselves
[2:07:41] and exercise themselves in it
[2:07:45] if i was engaged to a girl
[2:07:47] and i was a single man
[2:07:49] and i sent her something
[2:07:51] an engagement ring
[2:07:53] and she wouldn't wear it
[2:07:55] then that shows that she doesn't believe
[2:07:57] me
[2:07:58] she
[2:07:59] she she doesn't want to be my bride
[2:08:03] and if christ sends
[2:08:05] his church the gifts that he promised
[2:08:08] and they refused them and say they're
[2:08:11] not soul
[2:08:12] they don't want to be the bride of
[2:08:14] christ
[2:08:15] they are espoused to some other lover
[2:08:18] and not to christ
[2:08:20] the bridegroom
[2:08:21] so the real church keeps the promise
[2:08:24] and keeps all and accepts the gifts that
[2:08:27] god sends them
[2:08:29] all right
[2:08:31] so
[2:08:32] we're thankful to the message of the
[2:08:34] hour
[2:08:35] and thankful for what god has done for
[2:08:38] us
