[33:28] we're grateful to god that we do have
[33:30] warning
[33:35] the
[33:36] the word of god tells us that he does
[33:38] not do anything without warning us first
[33:41] then judgment
[33:46] so we're we're grateful to god
[33:50] you know it it used to be anterior
[33:53] i i i before we go i go there i want to
[33:56] go if you could turn into your bibles
[34:00] the second timothy a second timothy the
[34:04] third chapter
[34:06] and we're going to verse read verse 1.
[34:11] and it says this
[34:13] this year
[34:14] this know also that in the last days
[34:17] perilous times shall come
[34:32] with two topics
[34:34] and one of them is is is
[34:37] will be dealing with
[34:39] famine
[34:42] [Music]
[34:44] which is uh natural and spiritual
[34:50] and then we will be dealing with another
[34:52] topic that will be called the squeeze
[34:58] but i but i we one of the things that
[35:01] that we discussed
[35:04] and it is it should be on everybody's
[35:06] mind
[35:09] as you heard our pastor
[35:11] speak to us
[35:13] you know
[35:14] it growing up in the message christine
[35:18] we we we believed and and we still do
[35:23] of what brother branham said about 1977.
[35:34] we
[35:35] just believe what we believe
[35:39] but i i remember i remember as a child
[35:44] that
[35:44] we we had very little of what was the
[35:47] called the of the earth's possession
[35:54] and there is nothing wrong with having
[35:56] with having
[36:08] there's nothing wrong with having nice
[36:09] vehicles
[36:14] there's nothing to be
[36:16] wrong to be successful
[36:18] [Music]
[36:20] believe that we're all successful in
[36:21] here
[36:22] [Music]
[36:23] but one thing that we used to always
[36:25] speak about was the coming of the lord
[36:30] it could be tomorrow it could be tonight
[36:34] it'd be in five minutes
[36:36] it could be it could be right now well
[36:38] yes
[36:39] and i i remember uh that we would we
[36:42] would say
[36:43] it was 1977.
[36:47] we had even songs
[36:51] about it a song about it one of them was
[36:55] the saints go marching hurahura in 77.
[37:01] [Music]
[37:05] but what it gave it gave you is the is
[37:08] the always the urgency
[37:12] and the expectation
[37:15] of not how much money am i going to make
[37:18] tomorrow
[37:21] which is fine i pray that each one of
[37:22] you becomes a billionaire tomorrow
[37:27] but that wasn't our preoccupation
[37:29] [Music]
[37:31] our preoccupation was was that we wanted
[37:34] to please the lord
[37:37] and we wanted to consider
[37:38] closer to him
[37:40] and that he was right around the corner
[37:44] and every night i remember my papa and
[37:46] my mom
[37:48] they would play songs
[37:50] and we weren't we were not united around
[37:53] a television
[37:55] we didn't have ipads or iphones
[37:58] but we were we were there uh speaking
[38:01] about what god was doing
[38:05] i remember my papa
[38:07] he he would hear a message
[38:11] with the revelation that god gave him
[38:16] and we would sing
[38:34] [Music]
[38:43] is
[39:30] so i'm going to i'm going to start by uh
[39:33] by let's take the scripture of amos 8.
[39:38] verse 11 and 12
[39:40] verses
[39:42] and the bible tells us behold the days
[39:45] come
[39:47] in
[39:47] sayeth the lord you say el senor that i
[39:50] will send a famine in the land
[40:01] but of the hearing of the words of the
[40:04] lord
[40:07] and they shall wander from
[40:21] to seek the law to seek the word of the
[40:23] lord
[40:26] and shall not find it
[40:29] now
[40:30] when i began to read this scripture
[40:34] you know i there at the barbershop i
[40:36] have a scripture put up on my wall
[40:42] it's found in deuteronomy
[40:44] and it says you will be blessed when you
[40:46] come in and blessed when you go out
[41:05] and this little boy came to me and he
[41:07] asked me what's deuteronomy
[41:12] i began to explain that it was a book of
[41:14] the bible
[41:18] and then he asked me what is the bible
[41:22] and in my heart my heart sank
[41:25] interesting because when i was growing
[41:28] up
[41:29] whether you went to church or not see
[41:32] yvonne
[41:45] but as i began to think about this
[41:49] you see that yet
[41:51] for for us
[41:54] a lot of times the privilege that we
[41:56] have to hear the word of
[42:01] it should god
[42:02] a responsibility inside each and every
[42:05] one of us
[42:08] so sometimes
[42:10] this is so so we read the bible
[42:13] and and sometimes we try to figure out
[42:16] what well how is this famine going to
[42:17] hit me
[42:21] i'm in the message
[42:23] i read my bible
[42:25] and and does this mean that that god is
[42:27] not going to speak no more
[42:30] and it doesn't mean any of that no
[42:32] significant other what it means is that
[42:34] man no longer will have the ability to
[42:38] understand what it's saying to them
[42:47] as you heard everything else becomes
[42:50] more
[42:51] we put more focus on everything else in
[42:54] our life
[43:00] and sometimes we feel like we we heard
[43:03] from the presence of the almighty yeah
[43:08] and sometimes we we run off of the
[43:10] emotion of it yeah this is correct
[43:12] you say wow what a service it is
[43:15] what did you learn today
[43:17] i have no idea
[43:19] and a lot of times people are in a
[43:21] spiritual family without even
[43:23] recognizing it this is
[43:39] we have put the emphasis on the wrong
[43:41] things in our life
[43:43] emphasis in las cosas incorrect
[43:45] we see that the native americans
[43:49] they they they were very spiritual
[43:51] people yeah
[43:54] but the problem that they had was that
[43:56] they worshipped the creation
[44:00] more than the creator
[44:02] and we find that true that happens
[44:04] inside the church today in contrary
[44:24] it's great to write songs
[44:27] but but you see those things are to tell
[44:29] the lord thank you for what you've done
[44:34] if we never have the relationship with
[44:37] the lord jesus christ
[44:41] god is
[44:42] jesus then we have no idea what we're
[44:44] talking about or singing about it
[44:48] so so in this nest we see that people
[44:51] would rather look to a priest
[44:58] and that's all good we have to look to
[45:00] our pastors
[45:03] we have to understand it's not just our
[45:05] pastor as a man
[45:08] we have to understand that god himself
[45:12] there's a man in our pastor that has
[45:14] humbled himself are you are you
[45:42] this is what should happen to each and
[45:44] every one of us
[46:04] is that god's voice has never stopped
[46:07] speaking to us
[46:11] we've just stopped hearing his voice
[46:27] either no
[46:29] but you would get so upset
[46:32] and i'll never forget going outside and
[46:34] saying lord
[46:36] why are they so mean with me recorded
[46:56] omar omar honor your father and your
[46:59] mother
[47:01] i looked all in the trees
[47:03] i looked everywhere
[47:05] and i was scared out of my mind because
[47:07] i had no idea who this man was talking
[47:24] and what this famine does to you
[47:27] is it starts a relentless search in a
[47:30] person
[47:33] the problem is is that we stop searching
[47:36] for god a
[47:42] all of a sudden an idolatrous spirit
[47:45] comes and takes over us
[47:50] and you see in the bible
[47:52] any time a famine would happen
[47:55] it was because a lot of times that
[47:57] israel started looking after strange
[48:00] gods
[48:03] stopped hearing wanting to hear the
[48:05] voice of the lord
[48:08] the one thing i can't stress enough to
[48:10] you young people is this okay
[48:15] it's good to have entertainment
[48:18] it's great to have the dramas that go on
[48:20] in things
[48:23] but you can't you cannot deny the way
[48:27] you have to find god
[48:31] there's nothing old-fashioned about it
[48:35] gotta get those things and get those
[48:36] phrases and kick them out
[48:39] you have to find the way to christ the
[48:42] way our grandfathers found him
[48:45] the way our parents
[48:56] it doesn't just happen like lord i
[48:57] desire to to to worship you and how you
[49:01] know to for you to help me
[49:03] okay you have to begin prayer
[49:07] you have to begin reading
[49:10] you have to start going through things
[49:11] to search him
[49:14] the bible tells you when you begin to
[49:16] search
[49:18] he starts looking for you and you find
[49:20] out he's been looking for you this whole
[49:21] time
[49:24] but it ain't gonna happen
[49:27] well let's just fill the lord by let's
[49:30] have a little drama
[49:33] let's find these other ways to seek the
[49:34] lord let's have activities
[49:38] there's nothing that takes place from
[49:40] going and reading the word of god and
[49:42] knowing it and placing it in your heart
[49:48] so so i'll say this real quick and
[49:52] you know you see this
[49:55] today in the world in in in these
[49:57] churches
[49:59] do you ever wonder why you know you you
[50:01] see these from maybe elevation worship
[50:03] or these different churches
[50:07] you ever wonder why they all have the
[50:09] same worship like they all have their
[50:11] hands raised the same way
[50:15] start crying at the same time
[50:18] and a lot of times we see this on
[50:19] youtube as young people and we're like
[50:21] man welcome our church isn't like that
[50:24] is
[50:27] well what happens is that you find out
[50:28] what they do
[50:31] is they put a chemical in the air
[50:34] in chemicals and it drives a person's
[50:36] emotions
[50:41] and all of a sudden it's something
[50:43] that's made up that repentance
[50:46] and why do they have to drive the
[50:47] emotion of their people that way
[50:51] and the reason why is because they have
[50:53] nobody to give them the word
[50:57] that today the the earth
[51:01] they're looking for a real god
[51:05] everywhere for him
[51:19] we find there is an answer
[51:34] um
[52:28] i'm more of a preacher so i like to run
[52:30] real fast
[52:33] this is this is different for me
[52:35] but what does this do
[52:37] this makes you make sure
[52:39] what you have in your heart
[52:42] what the what is deep inside of you guys
[52:59] but it'll go remember put your your
[53:00] spiritual thinking cap on
[53:05] i mean it kind of it it goes back and
[53:07] forth together it goes back and forth
[53:09] [Music]
[53:10] and and so so you're one one of the
[53:13] greatest things that's going to ha and
[53:14] you're going to hit on this is is is
[53:15] ukraine aren't you is is
[53:17] what this is causing
[53:22] eventually world
[53:23] famine there or in different parts of
[53:25] the world because of what's happening in
[53:30] god bless you this this evening
[53:33] thank you pastor for confidence
[53:36] and uh i want to start off by using the
[53:37] same scripture that brother omar read
[53:40] is
[53:45] behold the days come
[53:48] saith the lord god
[53:49] that i will send a famine in the land
[53:51] not a famine of bread
[53:53] nor thirst for water but of hearing the
[53:55] words
[53:56] notice how it says it in plural
[53:58] the words of the lord
[54:04] is
[54:12] thank you brother mark for breaking that
[54:13] open glass
[54:15] uh it's hard to break the ice in the
[54:17] beginning
[54:21] it's a very good platform for me so
[54:22] thank you
[54:24] so thinking about famine
[54:28] you know and i was thinking what what
[54:30] can i say about famine that people don't
[54:31] already know establish
[54:36] everybody knows famine is scarcity
[54:40] [Music]
[54:42] lack of food
[54:45] so but as i started studying and going
[54:47] into this
[54:51] i found out that
[54:52] he actually what the majority of the
[54:54] world suffers
[54:59] they say about 800 million people
[55:00] worldwide
[55:03] they suffer from what's called food
[55:04] insecurity
[55:11] it's kind of similar to a famine is
[55:13] similar
[55:14] but there's some characteristics of a
[55:16] famine that make it a famines
[55:18] characteristic
[55:22] so we'll find out as we as we go but the
[55:24] majority of the people
[55:29] they're in poverty they're hungry
[55:45] so that's where i was so there's yeah so
[55:48] a famine okay they say famine is
[55:50] actually rare they say is
[55:54] [Music]
[55:55] is uh is uh
[55:58] it is
[55:59] uh it's rare it's israel in order so in
[56:02] order to be classified as a famine
[56:05] classification an area must exhibit
[56:07] specific metrics
[56:12] and one of those being that about 30 of
[56:14] the population
[56:20] is they're what's called acutely
[56:22] malnourished
[56:24] like severely malnourished
[56:29] yeah so and and that leads to a high
[56:31] mortality rate yes
[56:35] [Music]
[56:38] poverty and food insecurity
[56:55] a place or country that can have a
[56:57] shortage for
[56:58] like a small time
[57:04] element
[57:08] that only shows that there's a hunger
[57:23] categorized by the following factors
[57:26] [Music]
[57:29] it's it's severe food shortage than what
[57:31] we know
[57:35] but watch look at the causes of a famine
[57:51] it used to be a natural disaster this is
[57:53] naturalest it should be the crop failure
[57:58] fires etc
[58:00] but to say the number one
[58:02] cause of a famine today in this day
[58:05] la causa
[58:15] so the number one reason is conflict so
[58:17] you see what's happening in ukraine
[58:18] right now number one
[58:23] they say ukraine is as a major exporter
[58:26] of wheat
[58:31] because of the conflict there is
[58:33] a conflict i believe there was only they
[58:35] were saying like 10 weeks left
[58:42] that was stored up of wheat
[58:46] so like i said number one is conflict
[58:48] now
[59:02] not that there's a shortage of food
[59:04] which there is
[59:07] but it's the people don't have access to
[59:10] the food
[59:14] so you so you start to see like i said
[59:16] you jump around okay back and forth and
[59:17] natural and spiritual
[59:22] because there's food stored up in the in
[59:23] the storehouse
[59:27] but what's happening is not being
[59:29] distributed out but
[59:43] okay number one they don't have access
[59:44] to it
[59:47] number two the population because they
[59:49] don't have access to it
[59:53] they become what's called malnourished
[59:57] because of lack of food they don't get
[59:59] the vitamins that they need
[1:00:00] elements
[1:00:03] and even in the children and those of
[1:00:05] you that have had children
[1:00:08] knows when they're born they go and they
[1:00:10] measure them the height the weight so i
[1:00:12] think you can do
[1:00:26] their height is
[1:00:38] so famine shows that this has been
[1:00:40] happening for some time
[1:00:44] which ultimately leads to the third one
[1:00:48] and the third one ultimately is death
[1:00:53] but do the people die of starvation
[1:01:07] they say because of the malnourishment
[1:01:09] of the people
[1:01:12] they're susceptible to any disease
[1:01:17] or even something as common as diarrhea
[1:01:22] is
[1:01:34] it says at least 20 percent of the
[1:01:36] household given in a group
[1:01:42] they face food deficits
[1:01:46] with no ability to cope
[1:01:52] so the sad thing about it is you see
[1:01:53] that starting to hit america
[1:01:58] america the baby formula
[1:02:01] i mean you go go to the store and
[1:02:02] there's empty shelves all over us
[1:02:06] so you start to see it creep into the
[1:02:08] beginning stages of it
[1:02:14] you know they say that a lot of the
[1:02:15] elderly are suffering right now
[1:02:18] is
[1:02:33] but those are the ones starting to
[1:02:34] suffer
[1:02:36] so you start to see it creep in here
[1:02:39] [Music]
[1:02:40] in america we thought we were so
[1:02:42] everything was great and it is in
[1:02:44] america
[1:02:46] but you start to see it slip into this
[1:02:48] in this condition
[1:02:51] people in
[1:02:52] affected by a famine also experience
[1:02:54] other impacts
[1:02:59] widespread hunger obviously
[1:03:11] [Music]
[1:03:20] so you see the difference a little bit
[1:03:21] between what actual people that are
[1:03:23] hungry
[1:03:28] so
[1:03:40] now we're not talking about
[1:03:41] denominations those aren't even in
[1:04:49] [Music]
[1:04:52] through history are man-made
[1:04:55] many of the worst famines have been due
[1:04:57] to the poor distribution
[1:05:02] [Music]
[1:05:04] of existing food supplies the the
[1:05:18] which result in the lack of purchasing
[1:05:20] power among
[1:05:35] with the normal distribution or relief
[1:05:37] movements of food
[1:05:43] isn't that what we're seeing today
[1:05:46] unfortunately our administration that's
[1:05:48] in office today
[1:05:52] and
[1:05:52] others will talk about the oil
[1:05:55] [Music]
[1:05:56] but you see how the decisions that have
[1:05:58] been made
[1:06:01] are directly impacting the people
[1:06:06] so
[1:06:07] isn't it the same in the churches
[1:06:11] that's why it's very important to choose
[1:06:12] your pastor
[1:06:16] because he will determine
[1:06:19] how the economy of the church will go
[1:06:23] if he preaches half the word
[1:06:26] it's only a matter of time
[1:06:30] before
[1:06:43] but if the distribution isn't there
[1:06:47] so you start to see it
[1:06:49] the malnourishment of the congregation
[1:06:53] what happens
[1:06:55] diseases start to crop up
[1:07:01] [Music]
[1:07:12] few minutes okay so yeah
[1:07:15] um
[1:07:18] yes you can
[1:07:19] so how do we escape this famine
[1:07:24] how what are we gonna do how do we get
[1:07:26] away from this
[1:07:50] he says and i'll read towards the bottom
[1:07:52] i'll just read this last
[1:07:54] in
[1:07:55] about religion
[1:07:59] watch what he says
[1:08:01] you watch for a depression brother
[1:08:06] you think you've seen something
[1:08:22] you just wait long and cry to hear the
[1:08:24] word of god
[1:08:27] the bible says
[1:08:30] there will be a famine in the last days
[1:08:35] and not for bread and water alone
[1:08:40] but watch this
[1:08:42] what for hearing
[1:08:46] doesn't say the word of god
[1:08:50] because
[1:08:58] because there's a lot of things that are
[1:08:59] taken out of the word sometimes
[1:09:02] you'll want to hear the true word of god
[1:09:19] be strong
[1:09:21] this is going to show you
[1:09:23] how we escape it
[1:09:25] we're going to see how the widow woman
[1:09:26] escaped it
[1:09:29] and i just can't quite say like he does
[1:09:31] [Music]
[1:09:46] that stick was a cross two sticks the
[1:09:48] bible said
[1:09:50] the boy said go through the yard and get
[1:09:53] two stinks
[1:09:56] the same time up on the mountain there's
[1:09:58] a voice thundered down to the prophet
[1:10:00] and said go to the city i have commanded
[1:10:06] both of them obeyed
[1:10:09] something has to happen
[1:10:11] both of them are obeying
[1:10:13] if the preacher preaches the word and
[1:10:15] the man that receives it believes it and
[1:10:18] acts upon it something's got to happen
[1:10:22] if you're a sinner you'll have to be
[1:10:24] saved
[1:10:25] if you're sick you'll have to be he will
[1:10:27] be called god promised it
[1:10:30] if we are certain
[1:10:32] of god
[1:10:34] as certain as he's god he has to keep
[1:10:36] his word
[1:10:38] certain
[1:10:40] then the commandment must go to the city
[1:10:42] for i have commanded a widow woman a
[1:10:44] vision broke before the prophet
[1:10:46] here he comes walking
[1:10:48] he doesn't know where he's going don't
[1:10:49] make any difference
[1:10:52] he's just obeying
[1:10:54] she don't know where the sticks will be
[1:10:55] land but there's two sticks in the yard
[1:10:58] somewhere
[1:10:59] she starts off
[1:11:01] she goes out into the yard
[1:11:03] she looks like oh how hot the screams
[1:11:06] from the city the night prowlers coming
[1:11:08] in that streaming along drinking their
[1:11:10] wine and so forth she looks down the
[1:11:12] street she sees nothing she finds one
[1:11:15] stick part of the cross
[1:11:17] self sacrifice she gets another piece of
[1:11:19] stick and when she picked up that second
[1:11:22] stick
[1:11:24] oh i'll assume it must have been
[1:11:27] death laying at the door her and her son
[1:11:30] had to eat one little piece of a whole
[1:11:32] cake and die
[1:11:33] that was all of it
[1:11:36] and sometimes right in the midst of
[1:11:37] gloom that we hear the voice
[1:11:40] when she picked up that second stick and
[1:11:42] started back that was the voice come
[1:11:44] over the gate tank
[1:11:45] that smeared in the water
[1:11:50] in a vessel
[1:11:51] she turned to look with these two sticks
[1:11:54] in her hand
[1:11:55] with the meal and oral mixed and ready
[1:11:58] she said [ __ ] dressed it
[1:12:00] mixed it together that's what the word
[1:12:02] and the spirit has to mix together
[1:12:05] laid up on the cross of self-sacrifice
[1:12:07] to deny anything that's contrary to what
[1:12:09] you've asked
[1:12:11] that's right
[1:12:13] i've mixed it i'm going to get these
[1:12:15] sticks and that boy said bring me a
[1:12:18] little drink of water in a vessel she
[1:12:22] looks and she sees a man standing across
[1:12:25] the gate
[1:12:26] thin cheek
[1:12:27] bearded
[1:12:28] ball headed
[1:12:30] looking across the gate with an old
[1:12:31] piece of sheepskin wrapped around him
[1:12:33] looked like he was kind of a kind
[1:12:35] looking old gentleman
[1:12:36] she said i'll share my water with him
[1:12:39] waters of life
[1:12:41] you're willing to give it to anybody to
[1:12:43] tell anyone to go anywhere
[1:12:47] just a moment sir
[1:12:48] she starts back with the sticks in her
[1:12:50] hand
[1:12:51] and the voice thundered again
[1:12:55] not only do you shear your water but
[1:12:57] bring me a little marshal of bread in
[1:12:59] your hand
[1:13:01] bread of life water of life was it of
[1:13:04] life should die as soon as that perished
[1:13:08] bring me your water and bring me your
[1:13:10] bread
[1:13:12] what do we find here what lesson can we
[1:13:15] find

[1:13:19] and all his righteousness other things
[1:13:22] will be added
[1:13:24] bring me a little water and a marshal of
[1:13:26] bread then she turns in her gloom
[1:13:29] i can hear her say sir
[1:13:32] something like this
[1:13:33] you're different from man that i've seen
[1:13:37] and man that i hear speak you seem to be
[1:13:39] so positive of what you're saying
[1:13:43] but if i only got enough
[1:13:45] meal just a handful
[1:13:47] and just a spoonful of oil
[1:13:50] i've dressed it and i'm going to cook it
[1:13:52] with these two sticks
[1:13:54] i am going to eat it me and my son and
[1:13:57] die that's all i got
[1:14:00] what will your there next
[1:14:02] but fetch me the little cake first

[1:14:10] anything else what any evidence how
[1:14:12] gloomy it looks whatever it may be thank
[1:14:15] god first
[1:14:17] his word first
[1:14:19] doctor said i can't get well but his
[1:14:21] word first

[1:14:25] prostitute i'm a gambler i'm a drunkard
[1:14:27] god's word first
[1:14:30] though your sins be a scarlet they shall
[1:14:32] be as white as snow

[1:15:00] me
[1:15:02] put me first
[1:15:05] bring a marshal of bread in your hand
[1:15:08] and fetch me a little water
[1:15:10] she looked at him
[1:15:12] there was something told her that man
[1:15:14] know what he was talking about
[1:15:17] god knows his own
[1:15:20] sheep my sheep know my voice
[1:15:22] they know whether it's scripture or not
[1:15:24] whether it's right or not
[1:15:27] she turns into obedience that's what
[1:15:29] you've got to do
[1:15:31] and when she turned to obey what the
[1:15:33] prophet said do then come the thunder
[1:15:35] from heaven
[1:15:37] whatever man looks to hear
[1:15:40] or that cometh thunder out of the voice
[1:15:42] of the prophet that every sinner and
[1:15:45] every sick person wants to hear
[1:15:48] thus saith the lord
[1:15:53] [Music]
[1:15:55] how that people set my driveway and say
[1:15:58] come to this door my daughters and such
[1:16:00] my baby my soda just say the word
[1:16:04] how can you say it before it's in your
[1:16:06] mouth
[1:16:07] you'd be saying it yourself
[1:16:09] but they longed to hear that
[1:16:12] the saith the lord
[1:16:14] they had come across the fence because
[1:16:17] she was obeying and the gloom broke
[1:16:21] the sailboat
[1:16:24] the barrel will not go empty though the
[1:16:27] crew shrunk dry
[1:16:28] until the day that the lord god sends
[1:16:31] ring on the earth
[1:16:33] oh what a consolation
[1:16:35] she made the cake she gave it to the
[1:16:37] prophet she went back and made some for
[1:16:39] her son and herself and they eat and
[1:16:42] drink with plenty hip on the earth where
[1:16:44] did it come from
[1:16:46] how did it get there scientifically tell
[1:16:49] me where that field come from

[1:19:33] products
[1:19:35] and and
[1:19:37] and so there was very little little to
[1:19:39] eat
[1:19:42] but my father went out to the missionary
[1:19:43] field with ten dollars in his pocket
[1:19:48] and that was because sister ruth ruth
[1:19:50] torres gave him a ten dollar bill yes
[1:19:54] and so she went she he went out and and

[1:20:34] a a big bigger big steak
[1:20:39] [Music]
[1:20:42] told me to close my eyes
[1:20:44] [Music]
[1:20:45] and she told me to drink a glass of
[1:20:47] water
[1:20:49] and it would be a
[1:20:50] big steak
[1:20:54] i'm going to tell you in here and i'm
[1:20:55] i'm i'm a i'm a witness but yeah
[1:21:12] in my life
[1:21:27] natural have fed more than a hundred
[1:21:29] thousand people an element
[1:21:32] in uganda that otherwise would have died
[1:21:35] in uganda
[1:21:37] i don't really really understand that
[1:22:23] no
[1:22:24] no but the word of god
[1:22:27] has kept us to this day
[1:22:30] we eat like kings
[1:22:34] like no one around the world
[1:23:04] [Music]
[1:23:09] a new billionaire was minted every day
[1:23:13] during this pandemic
[1:23:18] at the same time
[1:23:20] the growing levels of inequality
[1:23:26] and the rise in food prices
[1:23:31] push
[1:23:32] 263 million people into extreme poverty
[1:23:36] this year
[1:23:40] how is it that the greatest country in
[1:23:42] the world can't can't can't find baby
[1:23:45] formula thomas
[1:24:00] jim as you're going to come into in a
[1:24:02] minute the squeeze
[1:24:08] but before brother jimmy goes into it
[1:24:12] a professor was preparing his class um
[1:24:22] [Music]
[1:24:28] if i squeeze this orange what will i get
[1:24:34] the professor said uh
[1:24:37] he looked at the professor and he said
[1:24:38] juice of course
[1:24:40] professor hijo
[1:24:43] don't you think the professor said if i
[1:24:45] could squeeze apple that i could squeeze
[1:24:48] apple juice from the oranges
[1:24:54] what about grapefruit juice
[1:25:00] no
[1:25:01] no you couldn't get apple juice and
[1:25:03] grapefruit juice from an orange
[1:25:08] juice
[1:25:12] orange juice of course
[1:25:16] he repeated his question
[1:25:19] why would i get orange juice from an
[1:25:22] orange
[1:25:39] it's correct let's think that this is
[1:25:41] not an orange
[1:25:45] but it is you pero
[1:25:47] someone puts pressure on you again
[1:25:50] says something you don't like
[1:26:06] why did this happen
[1:26:09] the boy answered el muchacho response
[1:26:12] because those things are on the inside
[1:26:19] brother
[1:26:21] the question then we must ask ourselves
[1:26:27] what comes out when i am squeezed
[1:26:30] questions
[1:26:36] you know when a man gets in that shape
[1:26:41] sometimes god brings them to the
[1:26:42] showdown
[1:26:46] it's in distress is
[1:27:03] you know
[1:27:05] it talks about how when the pressure
[1:27:08] comes
[1:27:12] the area of your liberty to area
[1:27:16] has decreased i'm in guado
[1:27:20] the rights that you had before
[1:27:24] when this squeeze really clamps down
[1:27:30] you cannot exercise them
[1:27:34] you know what tommy this shirt about the
[1:27:36] squeeze was a negative part
[1:27:42] but there's a positive part to the
[1:27:55] how many want to see
[1:27:57] what's on the inside of you come out and
[1:27:59] be expressed
[1:28:04] and with this i'd like to read
[1:28:06] acts chapter 8.
[1:28:10] verse 1 and then verse 4 verse
[1:28:25] but not in relation to what we're
[1:28:27] talking about
[1:28:32] you'll also find when he's talking about
[1:28:34] this squeeze when this pressure comes
[1:28:38] and begins to clamp down
[1:28:52] before i read this i wanted to make sure
[1:28:54] this is understood
[1:28:58] when they asked brother branham
[1:29:01] if
[1:29:02] there would be a persecution to the
[1:29:04] bride in this age
[1:29:19] it will not be a persecution like what
[1:29:22] the first apostolic church went through
[1:29:26] persecution
[1:29:30] but yet
[1:29:34] it's something that had to happen is
[1:29:47] it squeezed them to the point they had
[1:29:50] to leave
[1:30:00] and saul was consenting to his death
[1:30:06] and at the time there was a great
[1:30:08] persecution against the church
[1:30:11] which was at jerusalem
[1:30:18] and they were all scattered abroad
[1:30:20] throughout the regions of judea and
[1:30:22] samaria
[1:30:24] except the apostles
[1:30:31] now let's go to verse four 4.
[1:30:35] therefore they were scattered abroad and
[1:30:38] went everywhere preaching the word
[1:30:46] now the purpose of this great
[1:30:48] persecution to the church
[1:30:51] persecution
[1:30:52] notice at the time who was the head of
[1:30:55] it
[1:30:58] it was saul
[1:31:00] would
[1:31:15] putting effect
[1:31:16] all of their decisions of what they
[1:31:19] wanted to do with this bunch of fanatics
[1:31:22] that were preaching that jesus had risen
[1:31:25] from the dead
[1:31:28] orlando
[1:31:43] so that the word the gospel could go to
[1:31:46] many different places
[1:31:49] and so they finally come
[1:31:51] to to north america
[1:31:54] america wow
[1:31:55] wow but this squeeze that we're talking
[1:31:57] about
[1:32:01] i would call a minor persecution
[1:32:04] persecution
[1:32:06] and the prophet refers to it as a person
[1:32:09] of persecution
[1:32:49] but the purpose of this persecution is
[1:33:06] you guys can give me looking away to
[1:33:08] jesus
[1:33:15] paragraph 38
[1:33:20] he starts talking about something so
[1:33:22] tremendous
[1:33:25] that's not a part of our subject tonight
[1:33:29] but we do know there is a first poll a
[1:33:31] second poll and a third point
[1:33:40] it was
[1:33:41] the manifestation of the spoken word the
[1:33:43] manifestation
[1:33:45] and
[1:33:46] we'll leave it at that
[1:33:51] so now i'm going to say something to you
[1:33:53] now that i haven't said all along
[1:33:59] and that is the thing that we've looked
[1:34:01] forward to for so long
[1:34:06] for at least
[1:34:07] many years four or five years or maybe
[1:34:09] longer
[1:34:14] the third pool has been vindicated
[1:34:39] now remember there never will be an
[1:34:41] impersonation of that recorded
[1:34:44] personification
[1:34:52] i'm going to skip down here a little bit
[1:34:54] because there's a lot of reading
[1:34:57] i've only got a little over 10 minutes
[1:34:58] left
[1:35:01] but it was done like it just happened so
[1:35:04] it could identify its presence among you
[1:35:10] but it will not be used in a great way
[1:35:13] until this council begins to tighten up
[1:35:22] the council of churches
[1:35:24] the confederation of churches
[1:35:29] [Laughter]
[1:35:40] well we actually have a little more than
[1:35:41] that okay go ahead
[1:35:44] what's
[1:35:45] what why did the prophet use
[1:35:47] confederation instead
[1:35:49] of other words so many many times
[1:35:55] you know
[1:35:56] it comes if if you check if you check in
[1:35:59] google system
[1:36:00] google brother
[1:36:02] and you look for confederation of
[1:36:04] churches
[1:36:06] it'll automatically take you to a world
[1:36:09] council of churches
[1:36:13] and the reason is
[1:36:15] confederation
[1:36:17] is the alliance or the agreement
[1:36:21] in other words
[1:36:23] there's a difference between a
[1:36:24] confederation and a federation
[1:36:29] federation is when people get together
[1:36:32] get together to oppose a certain thing
[1:36:37] that's why that's why the pharisees and
[1:36:39] the sadducees
[1:36:42] of different federations
[1:36:44] but he came into a confederation
[1:36:49] to come against
[1:36:50] jesus and so now you find out that the
[1:36:53] greatest confederation that you've ever
[1:36:55] seen is that the greatest example would
[1:36:57] be the confederacy of uh of the south
[1:37:00] during during the civil war
[1:37:04] so it starts up
[1:37:13] and then it goes into a doctrine
[1:37:16] and then it goes into the incarnation
[1:37:29] it's talking about how all the
[1:37:31] denominational systems
[1:37:48] and now it's so intertwined into our
[1:37:50] political system
[1:37:54] but after the while you won't even be
[1:37:56] able to pray for somebody at the
[1:37:59] hospital that's sick without
[1:38:02] a card from this counselor
[1:38:10] when it begins
[1:38:13] to tighten up
[1:38:16] the pentecost and so forth can almost
[1:38:17] impersonate anything that can be done
[1:38:24] but when this squeeze
[1:38:26] comes down
[1:38:41] then you'll see what you've seen
[1:38:43] temporarily be manifested in the
[1:38:44] fullness of its power
[1:38:50] and then he says it four times see see
[1:38:53] he's looking see
[1:38:55] ben
[1:38:57] man i could go bananas with that right
[1:39:01] but you know there's a couple of
[1:39:03] elements of this squeeze
[1:39:05] elements
[1:39:07] because when they begin to tell you you
[1:39:09] can't buy or sell
[1:39:14] unless you have the mark or the
[1:39:16] image of the beast
[1:39:19] and all those that that aren't
[1:39:22] sealed with the holy ghost will receive
[1:39:24] the mark of the beast
[1:39:30] as we heard the the hunger the famine
[1:39:33] was not just for bread
[1:39:35] escuchamos
[1:39:42] one of the questions the pastor put in
[1:39:44] this this subject was
[1:39:47] will the bride go through this time uh
[1:40:35] i'll leave that there because that that
[1:40:36] can really cause that can really go away
[1:40:40] but now
[1:40:41] let's to understand when this squeeze
[1:40:43] comes down or this council begins to
[1:40:45] tighten let's go to paragraph 49 guys
[1:41:03] say no all right
[1:41:05] when he begins to titan
[1:41:08] and then if paragraph 49 says it's
[1:41:10] tightening esta pretendo sorry
[1:41:13] you're right
[1:41:14] yes he
[1:41:17] don't they is it's already happening yes
[1:41:19] that continues then when that time comes
[1:41:23] and the press comes to a place
[1:41:28] to where you're pressed out
[1:41:43] that creative power that will take what
[1:41:45] you have
[1:41:48] and create more out of it
[1:41:53] absolutely to the total loss absolutely
[1:41:56] but it will be for the bride and
[1:42:10] but watch this video
[1:42:14] even though the prophet taught that the
[1:42:16] bride couldn't go to his persecution
[1:42:22] he did say this
[1:42:24] he goes
[1:42:25] how
[1:42:26] is this gonna happen
[1:42:29] how can we ever lose
[1:42:33] and he says by being divided
[1:42:39] he said stay together
[1:42:43] he goes
[1:42:44] it'll be a paradox if he can get us
[1:42:47] together
[1:42:50] don't you worry god's gonna do it
[1:42:54] he'll bring a persecution
[1:42:56] persecution that'll
[1:42:58] make us run together
[1:43:02] that's what he's going to do let's look
[1:43:03] at uh oh yeah all the division in this
[1:43:05] message
[1:43:08] people say well who's the bride and
[1:43:09] who's not i believe there's bride among
[1:43:11] all of them
[1:43:14] we're not a judge of who is or who is it
[1:43:18] but one thing for sure but i'll go one
[1:43:20] second
[1:43:32] you're going to show your true colors
[1:43:35] colors
[1:43:38] so in order for that third pull to
[1:43:39] manifest
[1:43:43] he has to bring the squeeze
[1:43:46] that brings the persecution
[1:43:48] to drive us together
[1:43:57] guys can you give me that last quote
[1:43:58] because i have five minutes yeah
[1:43:59] ultimacita tengo sound five over but i
[1:44:01] don't want to go over 10 00.
[1:44:04] yes
[1:44:18] just one this one last little quote
[1:44:21] ultima
[1:44:24] watch this
[1:44:26] you guys got the paragraph guys
[1:44:29] 19c
[1:44:35] and god always causes trouble mostly
[1:44:37] always
[1:44:38] uh
[1:44:43] to bring the people together
[1:44:50] i believe there will be a time when
[1:44:52] there won't be
[1:44:53] any more division among the people of
[1:44:58] god
[1:45:32] amen i belong to this church where i
[1:45:34] belong to that church
[1:45:37] i believe the persecution will run the
[1:45:39] big ransom church of god together
[1:45:48] and we'll be one in christ jesus
[1:45:52] jesus and then he will take her home
[1:46:11] i read the little part on purpose first
[1:46:16] it gets you excited
[1:46:20] to get your body in
[1:46:24] but now
[1:46:25] he's showing you what it's going to take
[1:46:32] when the squeeze i remember one and i'll
[1:46:34] be quiet with this because
[1:46:36] those minutes i mean when i first came
[1:46:38] in the message and i i read this first
[1:46:40] about the streets
[1:46:43] about this boy
[1:46:45] what is he talking about
[1:46:49] and i saw this banana i mentioned this
[1:46:51] to you brother
[1:47:03] and then they got it at the bottom and
[1:47:04] they just squeezed it all the
[1:47:20] and he's
[1:47:32] god bless you
[1:47:47] until we see each other again
[1:47:52] amen god bless you
[1:47:53] [Applause]
[1:48:19] hey man i'm going to ask you just to bow
[1:48:20] your head tonight
[1:48:23] maybe there's someone here tonight or
[1:48:25] online that just feels their
[1:48:26] their time is running short on them and
[1:48:29] they want to make sure they're right
