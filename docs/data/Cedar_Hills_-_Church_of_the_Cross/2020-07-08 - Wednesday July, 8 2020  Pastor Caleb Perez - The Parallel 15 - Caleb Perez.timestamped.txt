[21:59] quiero que esto se sienta kun I want to
[22:02] go real quick to the book of st. Matthew
[22:04] I'm gonna be reading a few scriptures
[22:05] you know you know libro de Matteo ya Ali
[22:07] it's key to rasoi st. Matthew the fourth
[22:09] chapter in the seventeenth verse tells
[22:11] us what truly CCA knows DC and from that
[22:14] time Jesus began to preach and to say
[22:17] repent for the kingdom of heaven is at

[22:34] it means that it's close enough to touch
[22:36] him if we caucus all suficiente starck
[22:38] apart we're not far away now know where
[22:40] it's at hand
[22:41] it's close enough to touch it doesn't
[22:44] lose to VC at the start now at Matthew
[22:46] 11:12 says but they won't remember it's
[22:49] close at hand this is the Alamo no and
[22:51] from the days of John the Baptist the
[22:53] Rose vo the corn about peace till now
[22:55] the Kingdom of Heaven suffers violence
[22:59] literacy lissouba violence you hand the
[23:01] violent take it by force
[23:03] you lent those what about in other words
[23:05] we are in a battle that is hot in herre
[23:07] it's the rock but are you 40% and I
[23:10] believe that we all you all know what
[23:12] I'm talking about
[23:13] cuckoo states are in the locale because
[23:14] we're all in this battle together
[23:16] estamos those juntos in this stuff is
[23:18] after one thing and that is for you to
[23:20] give up the noose test the reading I'm
[23:23] gonna tell you tonight that that is not
[23:25] an option yes you listen which is tuna
[23:26] so giving up is not an option in
[23:29] distance when up surrender is not an
[23:31] optical energy in trigger since we are
[23:33] in a battle but we are victorious
[23:35] another put us almost victorious an
[23:37] author by the name of frangipane uno to
[23:39] report an hombre friend he wrote this
[23:41] review is to the primary reason for
[23:44] weariness in the church la primera
[23:47] doesn't the discuss the new necklace
[23:48] yeah it's because instead of moving
[23:50] toward victory lugar the movers in hasta
[23:52] la victoria we settle for temporary
[23:55] relief
[23:55] no centavos por una and remember stand
[23:57] for that again the real weakness the
[24:00] reason that we we become weary at times
[24:02] don't you know discussed emotional cost
[24:04] is because instead of moving towards
[24:06] victories can look at the mover no
[24:08] salami we settle for
[24:10] temporary relief no céntimos por una
[24:12] remedial things start coming our way
[24:15] okay you don't get hard disappointing
[24:18] due to the first thing we ask god
[24:20] Romero kept a muscle just to make the
[24:21] enemy leave us along Diskin and amigo
[24:23] knows the hay that get through tonight
[24:25] it was good lovers ahoy
[24:26] we have us we have a trial or
[24:28] tribulation comes our way it's a little
[24:30] tribulation and we say many times all
[24:32] the largest just let him stop let us see
[24:34] mother hired party parties in your Cape
[24:36] area therefore our attitude of a warrior
[24:40] Hulu tanto lucky to the Guerrero has
[24:42] been neutralized by our our passivity a
[24:46] pseudo neutral is nada por nuestro
[24:47] passive it every one of you has an
[24:49] attitude of a warrior
[24:51] Carlos test enacted to dominate again
[24:53] single one of you I know the con ustedes
[24:56] you have the spirit of a warrior a
[24:58] little spirit to them you were born with
[25:00] that spirit of a warrior this is pity
[25:02] Twitter right but there comes a time
[25:03] when that has to be manifested tiempo
[25:06] cuando tenía que money as I see this now
[25:08] we become passive in a lot of things
[25:10] moving order know some of us he was we
[25:12] get a little bit of peace little Paquito
[25:14] pass and we began to beat our swords
[25:16] back into plowshares yep I suppose I
[25:19] will bear moist respiratory I mean I'm
[25:21] gonna slay this and I'm gonna say it
[25:23] again and again whereas you know the
[25:25] rebel a passive spirit it is not the
[25:27] spirit of a warrior
[25:28] what's the spirit to the Guerrero you
[25:29] see it's not about the level of energy
[25:31] in your body certainly well then if he
[25:33] and su cuerpo what is the level of fire
[25:36] in your soul listen even if quick when
[25:38] it is on a lever level of fire in your
[25:40] obedience to the words we're going over
[25:42] the NCL Apollo this is what God is
[25:45] telling us through his word first
[25:47] through your enemy stick us with a move
[25:50] gather them like dust
[25:51] yes but still pull it boom I'm gonna say
[25:53] that again it's time to pursue or Sugino
[25:57] San tanco scatter them like dust
[25:59] yes / syphilis como pull boom he wants
[26:01] us to be prayer warriors agaricus
[26:03] Guerrero's your ask you not prayer
[26:05] warriors no no no / Koopas preocupados
[26:08] pianola see on did you get that
[26:10] Minton do I say that again win saloon he
[26:12] wants us to be prayer warriors
[26:13] Guerrero's Yanis you not prayer warriors
[26:16] ocupados in order soon remember you
[26:19] cannot pursue the enemy what are this
[26:21] you still put parts to get unless first
[26:22] of all you have pursued
[26:24] understand I'm in telepathic no
[26:26] tremendous church just entre mental is
[26:27] because we have to know that we have
[26:29] been with the creator chemist other we
[26:32] got to know that we have been with God
[26:34] before we can pursue the enemy most all
[26:36] the confusion to the personal enemy who
[26:38] either we will pursue our enemies as
[26:40] being person anymore our enemies and
[26:43] surely will pursue us what a mental
[26:45] enemy gonna pursue you know sort of
[26:46] problem sometimes Church I'm gonna say
[26:48] it again limo muchos vegetable we get
[26:51] very passive at time is this a mood
[26:53] possible you don't have to turn to it
[26:55] latina k.will TR but in second Samuel
[26:57] the eleventh chapter but in segunda
[26:59] s-somewhere capital only verse one and
[27:01] two that's one we those and this is when
[27:03] all the kings went forth to battle when
[27:06] the Polo religious a urinal of Italian
[27:07] David was king at the time Davi that
[27:10] arena so costume but he never sent he
[27:12] never went himself DeLuca for solo he
[27:14] sent Joab in your heart and his servants
[27:17] with him in all Israel he was gonna lead
[27:19] Tolu right but I want you to notice
[27:21] verse to you Lucas a female but this is
[27:23] where David got in trouble it's not the
[27:26] Dove it's about him he came to pass in
[27:27] an evening tide
[27:29] I want this you and I you see in that
[27:30] David arose from off his bed a lot of
[27:34] the said I want to de'vide that hit miss
[27:36] church assume equal to because why was
[27:39] he barely at evening time getting off
[27:42] his bed okay porque el entonces ella
[27:44] estaba montón de la cama was he may be
[27:46] getting a little passive it's not what
[27:48] the prone to say say a pity to outdoor
[27:51] nostril again he was still in bed but
[27:53] obvious not like I'm gonna tell you
[27:54] Church really clean up the worst thing
[27:56] you can do is just stay in big kudos
[27:58] let's get our cell we gotta do today
[28:00] look at that most guys no matter how
[28:01] you're feeling no there's times that you
[28:04] just seemed you can't go on as they
[28:05] could kill you in the name of the Lord
[28:08] is they gonna know but it'll get up live
[28:10] on get up off the bed to stay like a
[28:12] long wait till even better still move
