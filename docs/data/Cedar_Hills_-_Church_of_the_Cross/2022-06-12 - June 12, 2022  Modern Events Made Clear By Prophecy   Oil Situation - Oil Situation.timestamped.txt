[25:53] every day i draw closer and closer to
[25:55] god
[25:58] i do my best not to let nothing bother
[26:01] me
[26:05] because i don't want anybody to take
[26:06] what i have
[26:10] recently my bible was lost
[26:15] and it ended up back in the hands of
[26:18] justin brother justin and feliciano
[26:34] and i remember that day i was going

[27:31] gracia mori and misericordia

[27:36] time of need and trouble
[27:41] and i want to read this scripture
[27:44] first john chapter 5 verse 4.
[27:48] first john chapter five verse
[27:53] and then verse four
[27:56] for whatsoever is born of god overcometh
[27:59] the world
[28:01] and this is the victory that overcometh
[28:03] the world even our faith
[28:08] so um
[28:09] i went through a trial lately
[28:14] and
[28:15] i could have said poor me
[28:19] for me
[28:22] yes
[28:23] but i thank him for it
[28:28] faith is our victory
[28:30] faith is our victory
[28:34] victoria sorry brother freddie
[28:38] and um it just dresses closer to him
[28:42] um
[28:46] i was diagnosed with an autoimmune
[28:48] disease
[28:56] and um of all the names they could give
[28:58] it um it's called graves disease
[29:05] great
[29:06] disease
[29:09] and um
[29:10] so i went um
[29:13] actually i wasn't told that i was
[29:14] diagnosed with this until um just back
[29:16] in april
[29:23] and um so the doctor was very
[29:26] shocked to see me
[29:30] he said i should be severely ill
[29:34] really sick
[29:38] or his words where i shouldn't be here
[29:39] anymore
[29:43] that um stops you dead in your tracks
[29:46] for a minute
[29:48] it makes you stop
[29:53] but um
[29:54] the lord knows what he's doing at all
[29:56] times
[29:59] and
[30:01] that's a testimony in itself to still be
[30:02] here because i serve a purpose
[30:05] testimonial
[30:15] [Music]
[30:22] not to let anybody anybody explain it
[30:24] away from me
[30:29] but to know him is life
[30:32] and he took me through this test yeah
[30:49] and with that comes the victory
[30:52] victoria
[30:54] so
[30:54] my numbers were i had abnormal blood
[30:57] work
[31:01] and um he wanted to put me on medication
[31:06] i refused it because i had zero symptoms
[31:12] he told me he would see me again in six
[31:14] weeks uh for more blood work
[31:30] but i was determined
[31:32] that my faith would catch up
[31:36] to this testimony i'm giving you today
[31:41] so um
[31:43] thursday this past thursday
[31:50] and um he's looking at his computer
[31:52] screen
[31:56] he asked me how's the medication working
[31:58] for you yeah
[32:01] i said don't you remember doctor i told
[32:03] you i wasn't going to take the medicine
[32:04] i was going to try a different way
[32:12] or his face changed
[32:14] and with every bit of confidence i knew
[32:16] what he was about to tell me
[32:22] i knew what he was going to tell me
[32:27] he said what did you do
[32:31] i said well first and foremost i put it
[32:34] before the lord and i trusted in him
[32:36] with everything
[32:37] uh
[32:55] your blood work is normal he said
[32:58] uh
[32:59] normal
[33:03] and um
[33:04] and i was just it was just joy
[33:06] unspeakable i couldn't even sit in my
[33:08] chair long enough
[33:11] and it wasn't just that but it's just
[33:12] the walk that he took me through through
[33:14] all those growing pains and birth pains
[33:16] together
[33:20] to know that his his my faith had to
[33:23] catch up to this
[33:29] and i had a trust in him with everything
[33:30] that i had
[33:32] okay
[33:35] and i still have
[33:36] more labs to go and more things to do
[33:43] right as we were told we have an

[38:21] holy name the lord jesus christ
[38:25] a man and a man
[38:27] you may be seated
[38:32] hey man so
[38:34] we have uh
[38:36] tonight it's it's following our lot to
[38:38] to jump into
[38:41] to yet another another topic in in in
[38:43] modern events
[39:00] and
[39:01] so we're going to we're going to
[39:03] we've divided it up into sort of three
[39:05] sections
[39:09] i'm going to cover it from the natural
[39:11] standpoint so
[39:25] and then and then brother ronnie we'll
[39:26] we'll finish it out with with the
[39:28] spiritual side of it
[39:30] [Music]
[39:32] and and what oil means to the believers
[39:37] so so without further ado we'll get
[39:39] started
[39:43] and and we're going to talk a little bit
[39:44] a little bit about oil in in terms of
[39:46] the natural like i said
[39:53] and everybody who drives the car or
[39:55] watches the news knows what the deal
[39:57] with oil lately is
[40:07] once again the prices of oil have just
[40:09] skyrocketed
[40:15] the the crude oil which is the the raw
[40:18] product
[40:21] is a product crew that
[40:24] that gasoline and diesel and all the
[40:26] different fuels are manufactured from
[40:31] gasoline
[40:33] is is up around like 130 dollars a
[40:35] barrel is
[40:39] and so forth and so on
[40:42] and of course gas prices are
[40:44] five and a half six dollars a gallon
[40:51] and now we've sort of devolved into
[40:55] uh the fact that
[40:56] diesel is becoming hard to find
[41:05] diesel fuel is getting very hard to find
[41:07] what they call diesel exhaust fluid
[41:13] um it's getting very hard to find
[41:16] and so there's there's a shortage a
[41:18] unescas
[41:20] which which takes us to to understand
[41:22] what's going on right now in terms of
[41:24] the natural oil situation
[41:30] you've got to go all the way back to
[41:31] 1973. the most regressive
[41:35] and there's there may be a a a few of
[41:37] the elders here in the church
[41:41] that can remember uh what happened in
[41:43] 1973
[41:48] but basically what ended up happening
[41:50] was
[41:52] saudi arabia
[41:55] as a result of the united states
[42:01] back backing up israel
[42:04] israel in what's called the yom kippur
[42:06] war
[42:09] we stood with israel
[42:12] israel we supplied them with weapons liz
[42:17] and ammunition that they needed to fight
[42:19] the egyptian and syrian armies
[42:25] egyptian and syrian armies they came
[42:26] against israel
[42:40] so because we backed up saudi arabia in
[42:43] that war
[42:45] israel in that war
[42:50] saudi arabia said okay we're not going
[42:52] to sell you no more crude oil
[42:58] when that happened
[43:01] they put on the united states something
[43:03] called an embargo
[43:06] embargo and it threw our nation into
[43:09] chaos
[43:12] don't know if you've ever seen pictures
[43:16] but there's cars lying 20 30 cars deep
[43:22] at every gas station
[43:24] and either they would uh
[43:27] limit how much gas you got yes
[43:33] or they had no fuel whatsoever
[43:37] so
[43:38] that was the first time in the history
[43:40] of the world
[43:45] where a commodity like oil
[43:51] had ever been used as a weapon
[43:56] so now we're not talking about
[43:59] oil as fuel for your car already
[44:05] we're talking about oil as a weapon for
[44:08] control of a country estamos
[44:14] so when when this happened
[44:18] president nixon is is the president at
[44:20] that time
[44:23] and and he sends he sends his top
[44:26] cabinet members
[44:31] and they reach out to saudi arabia
[44:33] ivani
[44:34] uh and they tell saudi arabia look
[44:40] we got to make a deal with you
[44:43] we need your oil
[44:47] when this happens when this is to say
[44:50] it's a top secret thing that happens
[44:56] it was so top secret
[44:59] that it was not known about for 41 years
[45:11] saudi arabia
[45:13] decides that they're going to talk to
[45:16] this top cabinet
[45:31] up for grabs
[45:33] is
[45:34] is what's called our bonds
[45:40] a bond
[45:43] is the way that the united states
[45:46] estados unidos generates money
[45:50] to operate our government
[45:54] without bonds simbonus our government is
[45:57] broke
[46:02] so
[46:02] we negotiate a deal with saudi arabia
[46:08] and we tell them we will sell you our
[46:10] bonds
[46:20] you agree to not use oil as a weapon
[46:22] against the united states
[46:38] does not want to be recognized as
[46:41] helping the united states
[46:47] they don't want that stigma in the world
[46:53] so the agreement
[46:54] is that they'll form something called
[47:00] opec opec o-p-e-c
[47:04] it's the uh organization organization of
[47:08] arab petroleum the petroleum area
[47:11] exporting countries
[47:15] okay it's 13 member countries
[47:20] that make up
[47:21] guessing what they call a cartel
[47:25] cartel okay
[47:26] they control the price of oil globally
[47:35] okay so the deal happens with saudi
[47:37] arabia
[47:41] the oil in the united states starts to
[47:42] flow again
[47:46] everything's fantastic
[47:49] there are three
[47:51] major
[47:52] holders of our debt in the world
[48:01] china holds the largest portion china is
[48:12] japan holds 111 trillion dollars
[48:31] so we go along for 41 years everything's
[48:34] great everything's wonderful
[48:39] then the attack on september 11th
[48:41] happens
[48:45] after an investigation on what went down
[48:50] we discovered that two of the pilots
[48:52] that flew into the towers
[48:58] were from saudi arabia
[49:12] we're in terrorist warfare mode
[49:28] they called it up the president
[49:31] and they said okay
[49:33] you're gonna come after us
[49:36] we're gonna go ahead and call 117
[49:39] billion dollars of your debt
[49:55] so
[49:56] you're talking about oil now
[50:00] black gold
[50:01] negro
[50:02] now is a weapon
[50:04] now it's weaponized
[50:08] now it's the way it is
[50:24] so that's that's oil as a weapon okay
[50:29] that's the 1970 throughout crisis
[50:32] [Music]
[50:35] that created a global cartel
[50:40] global that that tells the world
[50:44] you will pay so many dollars for oil and
[50:47] gas
[50:52] and it doesn't matter what we say
[50:55] and it doesn't matter what we do
[50:58] they control the price
[51:02] so
[51:04] in the middle of all of this
[51:08] we see the different things that happen
[51:10] with the administrations in our country
[51:15] and they're they're they're going back
[51:17] and forth in you know democrat
[51:18] republican back and forth
[51:24] and oil kind of bumps up and down over
[51:26] the la over the last few years
[51:32] when all of a sudden
[51:35] you see
[51:36] where we're at now
[51:41] and and we're we're effectively in a
[51:43] nationwide crisis
[51:49] but it's it's not a crisis
[51:54] of
[51:55] the fact that there's no oil
[52:00] you've got to understand that
[52:03] the price at the pump
[52:07] and all the scary news about oil
[52:09] shortages and stuff
[52:14] it's not because there's no oil noise
[52:16] for
[52:44] versus
[52:56] very few airplanes flew in the sky
[53:02] very few 18 wheelers were on the road
[53:06] in las vegas vacationers didn't go
[53:08] anywhere
[53:11] and we depleted the reserves that we had
[53:18] all of a sudden
[53:21] covet scare is over
[53:26] everybody jumps in planes
[53:29] everybody hits the road
[53:34] and there's no more reserves
[53:44] are extracted from the same exact
[53:46] product
[53:51] so when everybody jumped in airplanes
[53:57] and we have a supply chain crisis
[54:04] and a record number of 18 wheelers are
[54:06] on the road
[54:19] to produce a little bit of gas or a
[54:21] little bit of jet fuel and a little bit
[54:22] of diesel a little bit of jacket a
[54:23] little bit
[54:24] the the the combustion
[54:27] [Music]
[54:28] but it's not because there's no oil
[54:32] okay it's because
[54:34] the manufacturer is
[54:36] the
[54:45] [Music]
[54:52] they can set the price of whatever they
[54:54] want
[54:57] okay so that's sort of the maybe a
[54:59] little bit of the back story about how
[55:01] we got to
[55:03] the story
[55:19] with iran if you don't mind what what
[55:20] are what are can you give us an idea of
[55:22] some of the different things oil is used
[55:30] i don't know how many have
[55:31] have looked into it
[55:35] but there are so many things that are
[55:37] made out of oil
[55:40] [Music]
[55:41] you know
[55:42] i can look around in here in the in the
[55:44] building here
[55:46] and i can see so many all the things
[55:48] that are made out of oil
[55:50] petroleum
[55:52] real simple
[55:54] the paint the paint on the walls
[55:57] the fans the lights fans loses the
[56:00] projector screen
[56:07] [Music]
[56:12] there is a very very long list of things
[56:15] that are oil that can be used for i'm
[56:16] mucho muchas cosas thank you brother ron
[56:20] so oil is not just for your car
[56:24] it's in everything
[56:27] and so it's become what they call
[56:31] the lifeblood of our economy
[56:38] it's literally what
[56:40] makes our world move
[56:51] and
[56:53] we see the move
[56:56] that our current sitting president
[57:04] and
[57:06] when he comes into office
[57:09] he signs an executive order
[57:24] public health
[57:40] and so this is in 2021
[57:45] but
[57:46] a few years before that
[57:52] the pope
[57:55] on may the 24th
[57:58] of 2015
[58:02] he issues a document
[58:06] this document is called an encyclical
[58:10] encyclical and an encyclical
[58:13] encyclical to the catholic world
[58:17] is one of the most important things that
[58:19] a pope can issue is
[58:32] of the thoughts and intents
[58:35] of the pope his his his very thoughts
[58:41] and he entitles it
[58:47] bear in mind this is 2015.
[58:52] and
[58:53] laudato c literally interpreted
[58:57] to see literally
[58:59] and i'll just read this in english to
[59:00] save time
[59:02] in english
[59:03] it's
[59:04] the first part of it is praise be to you
[59:06] my lord
[59:08] in the words of this beautiful canticle
[59:10] saint francis of assisi reminds us that
[59:13] our common home is like a sister with
[59:15] whom we share our life and beautiful
[59:17] mother who opens her arms to embrace us
[59:20] praise be to you my lord through our
[59:22] sister mother earth who sustains and
[59:24] governs us and who produces various
[59:26] fruits with colored flowers and herbs
[59:29] okay
[59:30] the next part of it is
[59:32] this sister now cries out to us because
[59:35] of the harm
[59:36] sounds like scripture we know right
[59:39] whole earth
[59:43] because of the harm we have inflicted
[59:44] her by our irresponsible use
[59:54] an abuse of the goods
[59:58] with which god has in doubt
[1:00:02] so why why is this important
[1:00:06] because in 2021 like i said
[1:00:10] our president nuestra presidente
[1:00:14] signs an executive order
[1:00:17] that reads almost word for word for
[1:00:20] laodato
[1:00:25] if you compare the documents side by
[1:00:27] side
[1:00:30] the verbiage is almost exactly the same
[1:00:36] and the intent is almost exactly the
[1:00:38] same
[1:00:41] and it's to push the world away from is
[1:00:46] there
[1:00:47] the use of fossil fuels the
[1:00:51] combustible fossils towards other
[1:00:55] renewable energy sources
[1:01:00] of which there's really only one
[1:01:03] does anybody know what the push was
[1:01:05] towards
[1:01:08] holland
[1:01:16] electricity
[1:01:18] he pushed from fossil fuels
[1:01:27] and everybody goes hey that's great
[1:01:30] but when you look at electricity
[1:01:33] electricity electric cars cars
[1:01:35] electricals electric semi trucks
[1:01:39] electricals trying to make an electric
[1:01:41] airplane
[1:01:44] when you look at that
[1:01:48] it is the farthest thing from an
[1:01:50] environmentally friendly renewable
[1:01:52] resource
[1:01:58] mining lithium is unbelievably toxic
[1:02:04] producing the batteries that involve
[1:02:06] cobalt and lithium combination
[1:02:12] it's a chemical nightmare
[1:02:16] okay
[1:02:17] on top of that in sima de eston lithium
[1:02:20] batteries are dangerous
[1:02:24] they can't explode
[1:02:26] they can burn holes in your pocket
[1:02:30] you ever seen the videos of what happens
[1:02:32] when one of these guys overheats
[1:02:39] and to top it all off
[1:02:42] the power that charges the electric cars
[1:02:59] so it's it's the worst possible solution
[1:03:04] that you could come up with
[1:03:08] so why the push
[1:03:11] so there's a lot of things and and
[1:03:14] it spills over into the next time the
[1:03:16] the financial
[1:03:18] side of things that we're going to cover
[1:03:25] so what i what i'm going to do is i'm
[1:03:27] going to i'm going to leave it right
[1:03:28] there for now
[1:03:31] and i'm going to i'm going to turn it
[1:03:32] over to brother sam
[1:03:35] and and brother sam's going to take us
[1:03:37] through
[1:03:39] his portion
[1:03:47] um so studying on this
[1:03:49] topic of oil and current events
[1:03:54] [Music]
[1:03:56] my question was
[1:03:58] how is all this oil
[1:04:00] transported me preguntas
[1:04:06] and i come to find out that the main way
[1:04:09] that all this oil is transported is
[1:04:11] through what we call the pipeline
[1:04:19] and uh
[1:04:20] remember the natural types of spirituals
[1:04:26] i want to read to you what this pipeline
[1:04:28] is and i just want to talk about what a
[1:04:29] pipeline is and then we'll go into
[1:04:31] what it is today and what
[1:04:34] uh biden and then his administration are
[1:04:36] doing today
[1:04:38] is
[1:04:43] so this
[1:04:44] a crude oil pipeline is the most common
[1:04:46] mode
[1:04:47] of transport
[1:04:55] so it comes first with a high up front
[1:04:57] investment costs
[1:05:00] [Music]
[1:05:02] and it has a long term payoff
[1:05:09] there's three major types of pipelines
[1:05:12] classes
[1:05:14] and this is where where i put on my
[1:05:16] spiritual cap when i was reading all of
[1:05:18] this yeah
[1:05:20] me
[1:05:32] it gathers the oil right from the source
[1:05:38] so here we have a prophet with the
[1:05:40] direct channel to god
[1:05:44] the second system is called the
[1:05:46] transmission system
[1:05:48] is my transmission
[1:05:50] and now this system refines its
[1:05:53] processes
[1:05:56] it's a two-part system so it refines it
[1:06:01] and then after it refines it transports
[1:06:03] to its customers
[1:06:07] so here we have the prophet
[1:06:10] getting the the word is oil directly
[1:06:12] from its source
[1:06:16] he takes it
[1:06:18] he processes it
[1:06:20] and he speaks
[1:06:22] so
[1:06:23] the third part of the of this oil system
[1:06:29] is called a distribution distribution
[1:06:31] system
[1:06:34] now that's what they call a pipeline
[1:06:36] that runs directly to one's home
[1:06:43] and we have the fifo ministry here the
[1:06:45] name
[1:06:47] it takes this oil and it transports to
[1:06:49] the homes
[1:06:52] so we know what this pipeline is now
[1:06:57] we know how it's used
[1:07:02] but what i want to talk tonight about is
[1:07:04] the keystone pipeline
[1:07:09] and i'd like to open up this with a
[1:07:11] scripture mark 12 10.
[1:07:18] and it reads have he have ye not read
[1:07:20] this scripture
[1:07:27] the stone which the builders rejected is
[1:07:29] become the head of the coroner
[1:07:39] so we have biden and his administration
[1:07:41] today
[1:07:44] they had revoked a key permit for the
[1:07:47] u.s to stretch a 1200 mile project which
[1:07:50] would have been this pipeline
[1:07:53] permission
[1:08:00] now this pipeline was going to extend
[1:08:02] from alaska say
[1:08:04] alaska it's going to come all the way
[1:08:06] down through canada
[1:08:08] and it was going to end up in the united
[1:08:10] states
[1:08:13] now remember they rejected the keystone
[1:08:15] pipeline
[1:08:21] now i want to read a quote from brother
[1:08:22] branham
[1:08:24] [Music]
[1:08:39] anybody ever know that the pyramid never
[1:08:41] had the capstone put on it
[1:08:49] sure i've been there in egypt
[1:08:52] never had the capstone
[1:08:55] corona
[1:08:57] it was rejected the cornerstone
[1:09:02] that was the cornerstone that held this
[1:09:04] building
[1:09:15] when the ark is built then the keystone
[1:09:17] holds it together
[1:09:22] the cornerstone is what holds up the
[1:09:23] building is that right
[1:09:28] and the cornerstone in the pyramid
[1:09:31] capstone
[1:09:48] so here we see that the keystone and the
[1:09:49] cornerstone are the same thing
[1:09:57] and i was reading on this keystone
[1:09:59] pipeline just
[1:10:09] that at the moment that that biden and
[1:10:11] his administration decided to stop
[1:10:13] production of this keystone pipeline
[1:10:23] there had only been eight percent of
[1:10:25] this pipeline that was completed
[1:10:41] you have the alpha you have the omega
[1:10:44] omega you have the cornerstone you have
[1:10:46] the capstone
[1:10:50] now this nation rejected the cornerstone
[1:10:56] does anyone know when they rejected the
[1:10:58] cornerstone
[1:11:03] this nation cut themselves off from the
[1:11:05] oil
[1:11:09] exactly what they're doing today
[1:11:14] brother branham says in the message
[1:11:15] condemnation by representation
[1:11:20] and what did she do according to the
[1:11:21] vision
[1:11:24] she elected the wrong person
[1:11:28] what happened in 2020
[1:11:31] i don't know how long it'll ever take it
[1:11:33] to run out
[1:11:37] but it will be someday
[1:11:51] she's been gone since 1956
[1:11:56] when she condemned and turned away
[1:12:01] from the great revival hours
[1:12:06] that was 1956.
[1:12:09] shortly after
[1:12:11] just
[1:12:12] the year that brother bannon preached
[1:12:13] this message in 1960
[1:12:18] the united states elected its first
[1:12:20] catholic president
[1:12:24] president
[1:12:25] that's president uh kennedy
[1:12:27] president kennedy
[1:12:29] the year 2020 that's what's going on a
[1:12:31] little bit
[1:12:35] we have biden that was elected into
[1:12:36] office
[1:12:41] and not by coincidence he's the second
[1:12:43] u.s catholic president
[1:12:47] president
[1:12:58] now this keystone was rejected did you
[1:13:00] notice it up there our angular
[1:13:18] and he mentioned something that was
[1:13:20] pretty interesting
[1:13:23] so this pipeline was to run from alaska
[1:13:25] through canada
[1:13:30] through
[1:13:32] and it was actually supposed to run
[1:13:34] through montana
[1:13:36] montana and if many of you don't know
[1:13:38] i'm sure you've seen it on the map
[1:13:42] but on the map
[1:13:43] the the state line of montana
[1:13:47] el estado de montana it's actually a
[1:13:49] silhouette of brother branhams
[1:13:52] but this pipeline is not going to run
[1:13:54] through there anymore
[1:13:58] brother brown
[1:14:13] and everything else but the hour is here
[1:14:15] when god will pour out his divine
[1:14:17] judgment
[1:14:21] so i'm thinking about this and then i'm
[1:14:23] thinking well where does that leave the
[1:14:24] bride
[1:14:29] because we could see we could see that
[1:14:31] the negative in all this and how it's
[1:14:33] affecting the world today
[1:14:37] but i don't believe that the bride will
[1:14:39] be left without
[1:14:54] but that doesn't mean that there's no
[1:14:56] oil
[1:14:57] petroleum there's still a reserve of oil
[1:15:00] they're sitting
[1:15:04] now spiritually who does that oil belong
[1:15:06] to oh respirator
[1:15:17] said in the kingdom of heaven will be
[1:15:18] likened unto ten virgins
[1:15:23] and let's fast forward a little bit they
[1:15:25] that were foolish took their lamps and
[1:15:27] took no oil with them
[1:15:34] but the wise took oil in their vessels
[1:15:36] with
[1:16:00] but in the spiritual the bride still has
[1:16:02] her pipeline
[1:16:18] i don't want to go too into it
[1:16:21] but in my dream uh the whole church was
[1:16:24] sitting just like how you're sitting now
[1:16:30] there was no space between everybody it
[1:16:32] was full
[1:16:36] and
[1:16:37] every person had their hand on the
[1:16:39] person next to them their forehead
[1:16:47] and they were just praying with all of
[1:16:49] their heart
[1:16:51] they were crying
[1:16:53] some of them were screaming and yelling
[1:16:55] but now
[1:16:56] next to them
[1:17:01] and i remember my dream i'm kind of
[1:17:02] floating over and i'm looking from the
[1:17:04] front and my eyes are going like this
[1:17:06] all the way down
[1:17:10] and it made just a big line he's
[1:17:13] implementing a grand linea and i shared
[1:17:15] this with with my pastor
[1:17:19] he said why do you think sometimes i
[1:17:21] have us put our hands on each other
[1:17:28] what is oil
[1:17:51] i was going to start off with reading a
[1:17:52] scripture but brothers damn right for me
[1:18:05] the oil is a type of the holy spirit
[1:18:09] now
[1:18:10] now for here from here on
[1:18:12] for the rest of this
[1:18:16] you're gonna have to put your spiritual
[1:18:17] caps on now okay
[1:18:21] now as brother carlos was saying
[1:18:23] carlos oil is known as crude oil
[1:18:28] petroleum or petroleum petroleum
[1:18:31] now petroleum comes from two latin words
[1:18:36] latinas from petra
[1:18:46] so this petroleum literally means rock
[1:18:49] oil
[1:18:50] is literally significant uh
[1:18:56] so so where does this come from where
[1:18:58] does the oil come from
[1:19:00] as we heard brother carlos it's a
[1:19:01] non-renewable
[1:19:03] energy source
[1:19:07] so
[1:19:08] oil is is made from
[1:19:11] living organisms
[1:19:16] that that uh scientists say that live
[1:19:18] millions and millions of years ago right
[1:19:20] difficulties in
[1:19:21] [Music]
[1:19:30] you know that that they have died and
[1:19:33] and they were gathered in this in this
[1:19:35] um
[1:19:36] in these like
[1:19:38] like cave kind of things
[1:19:43] and that's where you find this petroleum
[1:19:44] it's like in in uh in rock
[1:19:48] petroleum
[1:19:50] where it's sealed from the top and the
[1:19:51] bottom and this oil is gathered in these
[1:19:53] locations
[1:19:58] they're called reservoirs
[1:19:59] [Music]
[1:20:01] you know and uh don't have a lot of time
[1:20:03] to get into all the details of it
[1:20:07] but petroleum has been recovered by
[1:20:09] drilling petroleum
[1:20:14] that is the principal way the the main
[1:20:16] way that it is extracted
[1:20:20] you know and once it's been drilled
[1:20:24] [Music]
[1:20:28] and then they stick another pipe in
[1:20:30] there and shoot pressurized water into
[1:20:31] these into this rock
[1:20:37] and and they what they do is they call
[1:20:39] it what it's called fracking and as the
[1:20:41] square is
[1:20:44] [Music]
[1:20:46] so so what it does is it expands and it
[1:20:49] cracks the rock okay
[1:20:52] and it it
[1:20:53] opens up all these little channels for
[1:20:55] the oil to be able to seep into this
[1:20:57] channel so they extract the oil
[1:21:07] so that's a real
[1:21:08] real quick rough rough uh rough way how
[1:21:11] what oil is and how it's extracted
[1:21:17] now a couple of of uh events on this
[1:21:20] timeline of oil
[1:21:25] in in the year 1846
[1:21:30] the first modern oil well in the world
[1:21:32] was drilled
[1:21:34] and south i don't remember how to say it
[1:21:36] caucasus region of the russian empire
[1:21:50] so that's one of the events
[1:21:53] and the and then another uh year in this
[1:21:56] timeline that i want to focus on
[1:22:01] was in 1909
[1:22:04] the oil production in the united states
[1:22:06] surpassed that of the rest of the world
[1:22:08] the prediction the
[1:22:21] and the united states became the biggest
[1:22:23] producer of oil in the world
[1:22:30] now as the brother was saying
[1:22:32] after it's extracted that has to be
[1:22:34] refined
[1:23:08] your shampoo that we wash you wash your
[1:23:10] hair with shampoo
[1:23:16] toothpaste
[1:23:18] and
[1:23:25] now these are some of the daily products
[1:23:27] that we use every single day
[1:23:31] from the moment that we wake up the
[1:23:32] momentum you know these are the products
[1:23:35] that we use that are made out of oil
[1:23:38] you're deodorant
[1:23:42] and many many different things
[1:23:44] like brother carlos was saying
[1:23:46] now
[1:23:50] now i want you to i want you to keep
[1:23:51] that in mind okay
[1:23:53] that oil makes
[1:23:55] oil makes energy petroleum
[1:23:57] and energy produces power
[1:24:00] now a lot of people think energy and
[1:24:02] power are the same thing
[1:24:06] and although they're related
[1:24:10] it's not the same thing
[1:24:12] you know we'll get into that another
[1:24:14] time
[1:24:19] that that the energy produced from oil
[1:24:21] is the most stable the most reliable
[1:24:23] source of energy right
[1:24:27] now now and here this as the brothers
[1:24:30] were saying
[1:24:32] it's not that there's no oil
[1:24:36] petroleum brother carlos can correct me
[1:24:37] if i'm wrong
[1:24:40] it's that that's it's that the
[1:24:42] exploration is the exploration
[1:24:46] the drilling of the soil has been
[1:24:47] stopped
[1:24:51] and the the fracking it's been stopped
[1:24:53] the fracking location
[1:24:55] you know the you know like we said heard
[1:24:57] you know about the inflation and gas
[1:24:59] prices
[1:25:02] now the question is how does that affect
[1:25:04] us
[1:25:07] that's what we want to know right
[1:25:09] now that's just a little bit of the
[1:25:10] natural
[1:25:12] natural but spiritually speaking what
[1:25:14] does that have to do with us
[1:25:18] and that's what we want to know
[1:25:21] it's the modern events of oil
[1:25:24] but how do
[1:25:32] now again as as we said the
[1:25:35] oil is a type of the holy spirit
[1:25:40] and again it's made from plant life
[1:25:43] and animal life
[1:25:44] yes
[1:25:49] and i began to think about that
[1:25:52] and the plant life i was thinking about
[1:25:54] is like well working it's spiritual
[1:25:59] spiritual but brother branham says
[1:26:02] romano brown and lisa that there is one
[1:26:04] thing there's one sure thing that'll
[1:26:06] choke the holy spirit right out of your
[1:26:07] life
[1:26:10] that is a root of bitterness
[1:26:15] roots are are associated with plant life
[1:26:26] it's bitter against those that want to
[1:26:27] continue with the holy ghost
[1:26:34] but also brother branham says
[1:26:37] that denominations will also choke out
[1:26:39] the the holy spirit
[1:26:44] but brother ronnie we're not a
[1:26:45] denomination
[1:26:48] but one man and they're thinking
[1:26:51] and in their heart
[1:26:53] can be one man
[1:26:54] and although we are in the message
[1:26:58] we are in our mind uh denominational
[1:27:01] thinking
[1:27:02] spencer
[1:27:16] life
[1:27:18] now so that's you know just a real quick
[1:27:21] uh
[1:27:22] uh on the plant life
[1:27:26] but also animal life right
[1:27:29] and somebody might say well brother
[1:27:31] ronnie i'm not an animal
[1:27:33] running
[1:27:35] no
[1:27:36] no we're not an animal no no
[1:27:39] but but brother branham says
[1:27:42] that the human being was the highest
[1:27:44] form of
[1:27:50] now what separates the human being from
[1:27:53] from animal life
[1:27:57] is that the human being has has a soul
[1:28:01] you know but the thing about it is this
[1:28:03] like
[1:28:04] that the soul
[1:28:07] the soul has a fallen nature
[1:28:10] it's got the nature of the world
[1:28:48] just like just like how the natural
[1:28:50] types of spirituals
[1:28:53] how the oil was made naturally
[1:28:58] now now spiritually those plants of
[1:29:01] those animals in our life have to die
[1:29:07] they have to rot they have to decay
[1:29:11] you know it must be annihilated and must
[1:29:13] have a complete change yes
[1:29:18] you know and uh i just want to play
[1:29:20] something from our founding pastor here
[1:29:21] if they would the brothers would play it
[1:29:31] you know we sing the song
[1:29:34] it means you know how do you think give
[1:29:36] me oil in my land give me oil
[1:29:41] you know how you get all
[1:29:44] of
[1:29:45] the oil in my
[1:29:48] it don't come from me
[1:29:50] i'm sorry
[1:29:53] oil comes from the earth
[1:29:56] [Music]
[1:29:57] and it is the result of decaying of
[1:30:00] fossils and animals and bones
[1:30:05] and the only way you can get oil in your
[1:30:07] lap is when that serpent that's already
[1:30:10] been shot
[1:30:12] right next year he goes to the ground
[1:30:15] and out of that you get i o
[1:30:58] is
[1:31:09] it produces the oil from the inside
[1:31:14] it cleanses
[1:31:45] so now so now let's go back to that
[1:31:47] timeline for it real quick
[1:31:51] the tiempo 1846
[1:31:54] the first modern oil well was drilled el
[1:31:56] primero uh
[1:31:59] but what does 1846 have to do with us
[1:32:03] now did you know that during that era
[1:32:06] during that time
[1:32:08] how the natural absolutely types of
[1:32:10] spiritual
[1:32:18] russia was receiving the baptism of the
[1:32:20] holy ghost
[1:32:24] prophet of god says it was the first
[1:32:26] time since the day of pentecost
[1:32:31] let me read it right here for you
[1:32:33] the baptism of the holy ghost fell
[1:32:36] to santo the first time since pentecost
[1:32:40] in russia 100 years ago
[1:32:44] this is the message jubilee year 1954.
[1:32:51] that's right
[1:32:53] that's history that's historia and they
[1:32:55] had the baptism of the holy spirit
[1:32:59] and it worked signs and wonders
[1:33:03] a hundred years ago
[1:33:05] and rejected it
[1:33:36] you'll give if you i'm sorry if you
[1:33:38] won't listen to god
[1:33:41] he'll give you over to a spirit that'll
[1:33:43] condemn you
[1:33:46] and be turned over to a reprobate mind
[1:33:48] he said that cambiado
[1:34:08] because it failed to receive the jubilee
[1:34:10] message
[1:34:13] of the baptism of the holy spirit
[1:34:16] they were turned over to a reprobate
[1:34:18] mine
[1:34:22] they believed the lie
[1:34:24] and and
[1:34:25] and are damned by it in the sight of god
[1:34:29] you know and as i was meditating on that
[1:34:31] that quote right there
[1:34:34] i'm driving on the way to work
[1:34:37] and the and i believe the holy spirit
[1:34:39] tells me this brothers
[1:34:42] western watch russia
[1:34:44] watch russia
[1:34:47] and we all know that the brother said it
[1:34:48] not too long ago
[1:34:52] he says it three times
[1:34:54] but the question is why
[1:34:58] as we heard as i read right now what the
[1:35:00] prophet said
[1:35:02] could it be
[1:35:04] could it be because they rejected the
[1:35:06] holy spirit
[1:35:08] and went into communism
[1:35:10] so that's my thoughts right
[1:35:13] and if we don't watch ins
[1:35:17] what what happened
[1:35:19] we are we can very easily end up in the
[1:35:21] same state
[1:35:25] as we as we heard brother sam say that
[1:35:27] the united states has rejected it
[1:35:32] and we reject it and where are we
[1:35:35] we just heard brother branham he says
[1:35:38] brutal hearted
[1:36:01] now that was 1946 and i believe that's
[1:36:03] what it has to do with us
[1:36:08] in 1909
[1:36:11] how many know what happened in 1909
[1:36:15] i i believe all of us know what happened
[1:36:17] in 1909
[1:36:20] that was that was the year that brother
[1:36:21] branham was born
[1:36:23] so can you imagine can you see the type
[1:36:26] of people
[1:36:27] the united states becomes the biggest
[1:36:28] oil producer in the world
[1:36:35] and brother branham is born abraham
[1:36:51] now watch this vichy lester brother
[1:36:53] branham again armando brandon
[1:36:55] paragraph 44.
[1:37:00] okay so
[1:37:02] i won't have a lot of time to get into
[1:37:03] this so
[1:37:06] and now brother branham says and i was
[1:37:08] born april the 6th 1909
[1:37:13] and so the morning that i was born
[1:37:17] mother said they opened the window
[1:37:23] and so when i was born my first
[1:37:26] beginning to cry
[1:37:29] now when i read this the holy spirit
[1:37:31] says
[1:37:32] santa
[1:37:45] you know but the holy spirit catches my
[1:37:46] attention on this one thing right here
[1:37:51] he said he says he says but those that
[1:37:53] were were listening
[1:37:58] they said oh he calleth for elias
[1:38:02] now as i keep on reading this here you
[1:38:04] can continue
[1:38:06] it says and when they open up the little
[1:38:08] window
[1:38:10] just at the break of day
[1:38:12] [Music]
[1:38:14] about five
[1:38:24] you know so so so you might not think
[1:38:26] that this has anything to do with it
[1:38:27] okay he said that pennsylvania
[1:38:38] we all know the story of the robin right
[1:38:42] how we got his red chest
[1:38:46] you know and i can see
[1:38:48] how jesus is on the cross
[1:38:51] and here are here these little robins
[1:38:52] are here trying to pull out the nails
[1:39:01] and he's there and they're trying to
[1:39:02] take him off the cross
[1:39:06] and and i i can see these little robins
[1:39:09] that they're too small
[1:39:10] they can't
[1:39:25] and as these little robins hear the
[1:39:27] voice of their creators
[1:39:31] you know they're there like they know
[1:39:32] they can't take them off because they're
[1:39:34] too small
[1:39:36] but they also hear perot
[1:39:38] oh
[1:39:43] you know so so i can see these little
[1:39:45] robins here this old robin
[1:39:49] these little robins have since that time
[1:39:52] have a commission
[1:40:04] and when this this young this baby
[1:40:06] begins to cry
[1:40:09] here comes the robin
[1:40:11] and the and these robins brother carlos
[1:40:14] they remember the cry
[1:40:18] they remembered their commission
[1:40:34] he says oh you see that little light
[1:40:36] that that's right there
[1:40:39] he's all it came through my window
[1:40:43] like a whirlwind
[1:40:46] now we know that's the type of the holy
[1:40:47] spirit right
[1:40:49] so this is what 1909 has to do with us
[1:40:53] and he says that whirlwind sits
[1:40:56] sat at the t at the bed
[1:40:59] and there it is yeah yes
[1:41:01] and then it leaves
[1:41:03] now watch now now this little robin knew
[1:41:05] that they couldn't take him off the
[1:41:06] cross
[1:41:09] but there would be a man
[1:41:11] that would take him lift him up out of
[1:41:13] history
[1:41:14] and they could take him off the cross
[1:41:29] this was all that god was old
[1:41:32] he poured it into christ
[1:41:35] and this was christ all that christ was
[1:41:38] christian he pours it into the church
[1:41:42] so this this was god's point this would
[1:41:44] be god pointed to
[1:42:14] christ never sent me to build an
[1:42:16] organization
[1:42:19] christ sent me to build individuals
[1:42:23] to the stature of jesus christ
[1:42:40] and that
[1:42:44] amen and just to finish with this
[1:42:49] now we heard brother sam
[1:42:52] right now was the time to get the oil
[1:43:08] we see how those reserves are gone
[1:43:14] so what was the difference between the
[1:43:16] wise virgin and the foolish virgin
[1:43:18] center lasagna
[1:43:20] they both had oil
[1:43:22] and petroleum
[1:43:50] now again brother bannon says
[1:43:52] politically politically
[1:43:54] the natural also types of spiritual
[1:43:56] natural
[1:43:57] spiritual so if there's no more oil in
[1:44:00] the reserves
[1:44:03] and if we're nationally speaking nation
[1:44:06] we're going to then that
[1:44:08] that cell
[1:44:12] church
[1:44:14] where are we at
[1:44:16] and the bible says
[1:44:32] amen god bless you
[1:44:42] thank god bless you all this evening
[1:45:31] [Music]
[1:45:35] hey man how many are thankful for the
[1:45:37] word of god
[1:45:39] i'm so thankful that he's mindful of us
[1:45:41] to tell us of all these events that are
[1:45:43] taking place and how a prophet would
[1:45:45] come and and show us way before it would
[1:45:47] even happen and it's no surprise it's
[1:45:49] just a little
[1:45:51] shaking going on to get us ready to go
[1:45:52] home amen
