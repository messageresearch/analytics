[17:34] greatest price that could ever be given

[17:44] children's church worshiping God and
[17:46] serving our Savior you guys excited are
[17:49] you ready
[17:50] alright so we're going to read a really
[17:52] quick scripture and then we're going to
[17:54] take our seats because we have a little
[17:57] story to share with you all y'all want
[17:58] to hear a story tonight awesome ladies
[18:01] are you ready ladies are you ready are
[18:06] you ready let me hear you say an Amen
[18:08] really really loud
[18:11] Amen come on one more time amen all
[18:18] right so let's read a scripture who
[18:21] brought your Bibles all right so we're
[18:24] going to open in Matthew chapter 7 verse
[18:27] 7 Matthew chapter 7 verse 7 and this
[18:31] this is Jesus Christ speaking to us
[18:33] giving us really good instruction
[18:36] something that we can base our life and
[18:39] base our foundations in and we can grow
[18:41] up and become strong men and women in
[18:44] the Lord so I want you guys to pay
[18:46] attention to what Jesus is telling us
[18:47] you're ready ladies
[18:49] ready young guys pay attention to what
[18:52] Jesus is telling us he's saying ask and
[18:54] it shall be given
[18:57] he's saying see and you're going to find
[19:01] you will find got a seek first and he
[19:05] says nah nah and it's going to be opened
[19:11] unto you
[19:12] and that's a blessed promise from Jesus
[19:15] Christ you may take your seat so so this
[19:19] is a big problem with with little
[19:21] children and as you get to be big people
[19:24] like your moms and dads and like be one
[19:27] day you're going to be big I'm going to
[19:28] be grown up and this is a big problem
[19:31] because many times we're afraid to ask
[19:33] for anything we're afraid to go up to
[19:36] that big scary door not right we're
[19:39] afraid to seek for something that we
[19:44] really need or that we really want and
[19:46] we're afraid to ask and why is that why
[19:49] do you think that is any of the little
[19:51] guys why do you think that is what's so
[19:55] scary about asking anyone ladies what
[20:00] scares you about asking if you have to
[20:03] come down here what's scary about asking
[20:06] when you go and ask your mom and dad for
[20:08] something what's kind of scaring you
[20:09] what's holding you back there's
[20:11] something holding you back you're afraid
[20:14] to ask why she might say no she might
[20:22] say no and no it's not a fun word who
[20:25] likes to hear no does anyone like to
[20:28] hear no but the truth is that we here
[20:31] know way more than we hear yes who would
[20:35] agree with that as children you're
[20:37] always hearing though and you come and
[20:40] you ask and you really really want
[20:41] something and you're building up the
[20:43] courage and you come and you ask dad and
[20:48] mmm he says no and it breaks your heart
[20:51] and you don't like the way that feels
[20:53] and you come and ask mom and she says
[20:58] whatever your dad thinks and he already
[21:00] said no so you go away with your
[21:04] shoulders down and you're sad and they
[21:07] said no so you grow up
[21:10] fraid to ask afraid to seek an answer
[21:15] afraid to knock from that big scary door
[21:18] because what are they going to tell you
[21:20] so then we go through life and we pray
[21:23] who prays kids who prays ladies you pray
[21:26] raise your hand high if you pray that's
[21:29] something to be proud of I pray who
[21:31] prays for their food yes you pray for
[21:33] your food who prays for their day that
[21:37] God will just be with you through this
[21:39] day and he'll bless you who prays for
[21:42] your mom and dad and you go on a trip
[21:44] you pray that God be God will be with
[21:46] you on this trip and that's all great
[21:49] and we should pray for those things but
[21:52] do you realize that the God you're
[21:53] praying for when you say blessed be
[21:55] peace he's the one that parted the red
[21:59] seas with one blow of his nostrils he
[22:02] parted the Red Sea and he made a way for
[22:06] the children of Israel to get through on
[22:08] dry ground that's the same God it's
[22:10] going to come down and bless your little
[22:11] pile of peas do you realize that do you
[22:15] realize that when you're praying for God
[22:17] to bless this day be with me through
[22:21] this day lord I pray in Jesus name Amen
[22:24] and those are easy things to ask for but
[22:27] that same God that you pray for that's
[22:29] blessing this day one day he stopped the
[22:32] Sun in its tracks and he said son stand
[22:36] still
[22:36] earth moved no more until I tell you to
[22:39] move he stopped it right in the sky can
[22:42] you guys imagine that God could stop the
[22:45] Sun so the thing is that we grow up and
[22:48] were afraid to ask for things but Jesus
[22:52] tells us he says ask ask me seek me pray
[22:57] get on your knees and pray but ask me
[23:00] something that's going to get me up
[23:02] that's going to get me moving God likes
[23:06] to move on his people who believes that
[23:09] he likes to move he likes to exercise
[23:12] his power and we go through life just
[23:16] asking for the little things and afraid
[23:20] that if we ask for the really big things
[23:23] the scary things that the answer is
[23:25] going to be no or maybe there's not
[23:28] enough power in the world or enough
[23:30] resources in the world to do to even
[23:34] imagine to begin to do what we're
[23:36] wanting in our heart so I'm going to
[23:39] talk about somebody or give me just a
[23:43] second I'm going to talk about somebody
[23:47] today who wasn't afraid to ask who
[23:52] wasn't afraid to see God because you're
[23:54] going to find as you go through life and
[23:56] you get a little bit older right you're
[23:59] in school now and maybe there's a bully
[24:02] who has whose experience to bully out
[24:04] there in school somebody mean and
[24:07] vicious and rude and cruel and they
[24:11] probably definitely don't know the Lord
[24:13] that you know so they don't know how to
[24:15] treat people they mistreat you and they
[24:17] mistreat others around them and you go
[24:20] through life and you realize right away
[24:21] you're young and you don't want to go to
[24:24] school today because that bully is going
[24:26] to bully you he's gonna mess with you
[24:28] he's going to hit you he's going to
[24:29] possibly hurt you and you realize right
[24:32] away that you need God even in that
[24:34] situation you need God so you pray for
[24:37] God to bless you on that day because
[24:39] you're afraid and you're going to go
[24:42] through life and you're going to realize
[24:43] that the more and more things you go
[24:45] through the more things that you face
[24:46] that you're going to need God more and
[24:49] more and more and I love something our
[24:52] prophet tells us brother Branham tells
[24:54] us if you want more of God well there's
[24:58] more of God to have and that should
[25:00] excite you guys tonight because we need
[25:02] more of God and we should want more of
[25:05] God so we're going to talk about
[25:07] somebody that who wasn't afraid to pray
[25:10] and ask God for the really big things
[25:14] the impossible things the things that
[25:16] are just mind-blowing that God would you
[25:21] really do this for me and Jesus tells us
[25:24] seek and you're going to find knock and
[25:27] it's going to be open to you you guys
[25:30] can't be afraid to ask God for all of
[25:34] the things that you're going to need in
[25:35] your life because God
[25:37] is our resource and he's our supplier
[25:40] he's going to supply our needs so who's
[25:42] heard of hezekiah there's a guy a couple
[25:46] um who's heard of let's let's let's tell
[25:50] you the name of the bad guy who's heard
[25:53] of Sennacherib Sennacherib he's the bad
[25:58] guy in the story there's there's always
[26:00] he like there always has to be a bad guy
[26:03] why can't we have a story with just a
[26:05] good guy right that's just not the way
[26:07] life is there's got to be a bad guy
[26:09] because the bad guy helps us or helps to
[26:14] prove that the good guy really is the
[26:16] good guy he's the best and this was the
[26:19] best that God had in this time so
[26:21] Hezekiah and it's in Hezekiah chapter 19
[26:24] that you can read this story you guys
[26:26] can read it at home we won't read the
[26:28] whole story but I want to tell you about
[26:29] Hezekiah because he's pretty inspiring
[26:32] he inspired me and he made me realize
[26:34] that God is able and he's more than able
[26:39] and he's willing to help us out if we
[26:42] only come and ask I can't imagine what
[26:44] would have happened if Hezekiah didn't
[26:46] come before God and pray and ask because
[26:49] you see the sky
[26:50] Sennacherib it was a bully in the days
[26:54] of Hezekiah and all around the
[26:57] countryside all up and down the coast
[27:00] Sennacherib had come and he was
[27:02] destroying he was pillaging he was
[27:05] killing he was murdering he was taking
[27:07] entire countries and entire cities and
[27:10] here he comes down the coast headed
[27:12] towards Jerusalem or Judah where
[27:16] Hezekiah was the king and he was a king
[27:18] but there was this army that was mighty
[27:21] and they were scary and they were coming
[27:23] and they were going to come for him and
[27:25] how he knew this is he sent a letter in
[27:28] advance and Hezekiah
[27:30] receives this letter and this letter
[27:32] tells him Hezekiah don't even let your
[27:35] God deceive you the God that you serve
[27:37] don't let him deceive you into thinking
[27:39] that he's going to deliver you because
[27:41] he might just do that but he said look
[27:44] at all these countries I've destroyed
[27:46] did their God save them they didn't look
[27:50] where they're at
[27:51] they're all dead there demolish I've uh
[27:53] Turley he says I've uh Turley destroyed
[27:56] them so don't let your god deceive you
[27:59] into thinking that you're going to be
[28:01] safe
[28:02] so Hezekiah gets this letter and
[28:05] Hezekiah 19:14 we'll just read this
[28:08] verse
[28:09] Hezekiah 19:14 just to see what Hezekiah
[28:12] does so Hezekiah receives the letter of
[28:15] the hand of the messengers he reads it
[28:18] it's a pretty scary letter and Hezekiah
[28:21] went up into the house of the Lord and
[28:24] he spread it out before the Lord this
[28:26] very letter that this evil man
[28:29] Sennacherib had sent him he spreads it
[28:31] out before the Lord in the presence of
[28:33] God and there he prays first fifteen
[28:36] says he prayed before the Lord and said
[28:39] O Lord God of the Israel which dwelleth
[28:42] between the cherubims thou art to God
[28:45] even thou alone of all the kingdoms of
[28:48] the earth thou has made heaven and earth
[28:50] Oh Lord bow down your ear and hear open
[28:53] up Lord dine eyes and see and hear the
[28:56] words of Sennacherib which has he has
[28:58] sent to him to reproach the Living God
[29:01] so there Hezekiah is he could have been
[29:04] there all night long praying because the
[29:06] Assyrian army approaches 185 thousand
[29:11] men you guys know how many men that is
[29:14] all in one group how many is that that's
[29:17] a lot of men in one group and here they
[29:20] come
[29:20] and they're going to demolish Jerusalem
[29:23] and Hezekiah only hope is to seek and to
[29:28] pray and to knock and he comes to the
[29:31] temple and he's knocking on the door
[29:34] that great door and he's knocking and
[29:36] he's seeking an answer and he could have
[29:38] been there all night praying and he says
[29:41] in verse 19
[29:42] therefore Lord I beseech you save us out
[29:46] of his hand and all the kingdoms of the
[29:48] earth may know that thou art the Lord
[29:50] God so what do you guys think God did
[29:54] for Hezekiah what do you guys think
[29:57] happens next with this great Assyrian
[30:00] army any idea
[30:05] god save them
[30:07] gee that guy think God is going to save
[30:09] them from this army well let's read
[30:14] about it let's see what God does because
[30:16] God is an awesome God you guys believe
[30:18] that he's a he's a he's an all supplying
[30:22] God he supplies our needs he's there
[30:24] when he needs us we just have to seek
[30:26] Him we just have to search we have to
[30:28] knock we have to find and we're going to
[30:30] find our answer so verse 32 verse 35
[30:38] let's go down to verse 35
[30:40] so here Hezekiah is and I'm sure the
[30:44] entire city is scared to death what's
[30:46] going to happen this army is coming it's
[30:48] going to destroy them and they already
[30:51] know this army has destroyed everybody
[30:52] around them all the nations all the
[30:54] cities they've been demolished they've
[30:56] been destroyed and it came to pass that
[30:59] night that the angel of the Lord went
[31:01] out imagine the angel of the Lord going
[31:05] out and fighting for you going out
[31:07] before you in places that you were
[31:10] afraid to go but here goes the angel of
[31:12] the Lord and he smoked in the camp the
[31:15] Assyrians a hundred forty score 104
[31:19] score five thousand when they arose
[31:21] early in the morning behold they were
[31:25] all dead corpses so imagine here is
[31:29] Hezekiah he'd been praying all night he
[31:31] comes through the city wall in the
[31:33] morning and he sees the entire Assyrian
[31:36] army and there they were laying dead in
[31:39] the fields and on the hillsides and not
[31:42] a single I love that the Lord said says
[31:45] to Hezekiah they're not going to shoot
[31:47] an arrow here they're not going to come
[31:49] and do this city they're not going to
[31:50] even enter the walls and there goes
[31:53] Hezekiah and he sees and the entire
[31:55] Assyrian army is out laying like dead
[31:59] corpses so what do you guys what are you
[32:04] afraid of tonight to come before God and
[32:06] to ask him imagine asking him very
[32:09] simply from your heart Lord this thing
[32:13] that I'm facing this trial this hardship
[32:17] it doesn't even matter what it is it
[32:19] doesn't matter how hard it is what
[32:22] you're facing and as you guys grow up
[32:24] and become young men and young ladies
[32:26] there's nothing that God can't do he
[32:30] stopped the mouths of lions he parted
[32:34] the Red Sea he created the universe the
[32:37] galaxies of stars and what he wouldn't
[32:40] do for one of us that he loves more than
[32:43] anything and that's why he redeemed us
[32:45] so if you're redeemed go ahead and stand
[32:48] to your feet
[32:49] we're going to sing a little bit more
[32:50] brother will and I want you guys to
[32:52] really worship the Lord I want you to
[32:54] stand to your feet who can raise your
[32:56] hands with me young men if you can raise
[32:58] your hands to the Lord
[33:00] young ladies raise your hands don't be
[33:02] afraid to worship Him because he is
[33:05] worthy of our praises folk just like
[33:10] Hezekiah here comes the devil to each
[33:16] one of you and doesn't matter how little
[33:18] you are how old you are how smart you
[33:21] are here comes the devil and his only
[33:26] goal is to utterly destroy you to make
[33:31] nothing of you to make an ash heap of
[33:33] you and to walk away feeling satisfied
[33:38] and good with what he did to your life
[33:40] and he's going to do it in very in many
[33:45] many ways there's many things just like
[33:47] the bully at school there's other ways
[33:49] that he's going to come and he's going
[33:51] to try to destroy you and he's going to
[33:54] fight and he's going to try to kill you
[33:57] to try to harm you try to hurt you and
[33:59] that's why we say our prayers every day
[34:01] but we can't be afraid to ask God for
[34:03] the really really big thing
[34:06] because maybe the answer is going to be
[34:10] no sometimes but believe me when when
[34:14] you're it's your life your soul is on
[34:18] the line
[34:18] God is going to come through for us who
[34:20] believes that tonight when you need him
[34:23] the most he's going to be there for you
[34:25] and if he has to slay 185 thousand
[34:29] people just to save you because you're
[34:31] his child you're his daughter you're his
[34:34] son
[34:34] then he's going to do it and he's going
[34:37] to come through big for you guys and I
[34:39] know because in my own life I've seen
[34:41] him come through really big in really
[34:44] big ways and in ways that surprised me
[34:48] and amazed me and that's why I love him

[46:28] [Music]
[46:45] how old are you yeah so you might say
[46:50] she's too young
[46:51] say so for age do we start baptizing
[46:56] nowadays you got baptized and young
[47:00] nothin mean the founding pastor words he
[47:03] says uh not against the house gurus
[47:06] Aronofsky no Stan of Chico's yeah these
[47:09] guys according to the Word of God and
[47:12] the last day they would be weaker but
[47:14] wiser if we wanted to know anything we
[47:19] would have to burn our eyelids and get
[47:22] books or go to the library and study and
[47:25] study now like the Prester said this
[47:29] morning
[47:29] I don't like instant things now all
[47:34] these young kids young people they're
[47:37] instant geniuses you know you wanna know
[47:41] something get a smartphone there it is
[47:44] we didn't know nothing we didn't have
[47:48] telephone we didn't have TVs we had
[47:53] nothing but ourselves and a bunch of
[47:55] gurus again and over but it made a
[48:00] strong the finalist it'll be weaker we
[48:04] were strong we were real skinny but
[48:06] strong and we burned our eyelids to
[48:10] learn but now they are so far advanced
[48:15] at his age we not all that I was like I
[48:20] said we were just mischievious kids you
[48:25] know just to a little testimony we were
[48:33] caught me and tongue in any killing
[48:37] cherries and apricots from triskin
[48:39] imagine and they call the cops you know
[48:43] because there was a lot of
[48:44] discrimination the angles on one side
[48:48] and the mexican-americans in another
[48:50] side and because we were stealing from
[48:53] the angles they call the COS and they
[48:56] took us to trial I think
[48:58] to scare us it to scare the boots out of
[49:01] me and tell me you know so let's that's
[49:06] hard to do in a Halloween you know what
[49:10] would we do everybody has the Mexican
[49:15] Americans did not have indoor plumbing
[49:17] we had a toilet outside from Halloween
[49:19] we would throw the toilet in one time
[49:22] there was somebody sitting on the toilet
[49:24] and we knocked it down with it there's
[49:27] what we used to do so now the questions
[49:31] back
[49:32] should we baptize young kids they should
[49:38] know how to do this they know how to
[49:40] smoke drugs and do these in there
[49:45] so I think now is the time is when they
[49:49] God speaks to them but let me say
[49:52] something for the parents before we
[49:54] baptize this young boy when you have
[49:59] your children there are as they say and
[50:02] down you the parents should be
[50:06] responsible for this tree to grow
[50:09] straight because if they get baptized
[50:11] and you don't come to church or you just
[50:14] leave them alone don't run the things of
[50:16] that at home then that tree will grow
[50:20] crooked so I pray also for the parents
[50:25] of this young boy that God will help
[50:29] them raise this boy in the ways of the
[50:32] Lord so when they grow they will not
[50:34] depart from it we have here this young
[50:42] boy my great grandson and they named him
[50:47] after me
[50:48] so we have a bunch of Abraham Paris so
[50:51] anyway Abraham I'm going to pray
[50:56] precious and Heavenly Father as we come
[51:00] before your presence Lord God you've
[51:04] been knocking on his heart and he's been
[51:08] asking for baptism for a little while
[51:11] I already talked to him a few times and
[51:14] I'm sure his parents have also and Lord
[51:18] we just ask him then for his parents
[51:20] that you might help them you know frame
[51:26] this young boy in your ways north of
[51:29] this tree can grow straight and in due
[51:32] time
[51:33] it might bear good fruit Laura and my
[51:37] hippie as he grows an example in school
[51:40] as he goes and plays with boys his own
[51:45] age but Lord were right now we're gonna
[51:49] baptize it in your name Lord the only
[51:52] name that has power the only name that
[51:54] says their name that has redeemed us as
[51:57] we heard this morning so Lord I'm just
[52:01] praying this prayer for him
[52:30] Abraham Paris is a minister of the
[52:34] endtime gospel to baptize you unto the
[52:37] name of our Lord Jesus Christ for the
[52:40] remission of your sins and the Lord will
[52:43] give you the gift of the Holy Ghost
[52:45] I'm to the name of the Lord Jesus Christ
