[Music] [Applause] god bless you all tonight agree to all in the precious name of our lord jesus christ it's only by god's grace that we are here the name of the lord jesus christ we pray the number jesus christ amen amen amen you may be seated it sure is good to be here tonight it's pretty nice to be standing next to our new papa here [Applause] if there's anybody in the fellowship hall i don't know by the numbers that are in here i don't probably there's yeah there are okay god bless you everybody in the fellowship everybody that's online at home god bless you tonight it's sir good to uh to be here it's good to see you bueno and and also to feel you tonight uh we uh we have something we want to talk about and uh we had uh i had you know the lord is always so rich gives us so many so many things that helps us through the to our days you write some of them down preach about that one of these days [Music] the lord directed me in a different direction and it completely captured my attention and i almost called him and said brother caleb can we just maybe play that tape tonight instead of me preaching of my my brothers or sisters to not be able to understand it so in that spirit tonight uh we're gonna we're gonna the title is taking sides to if you want to hear something that's very timely for our day for today go hear our prophet in that message taking sides at the end when we get done here if there's time i i want to read you an excerpt from that message it's the thing that kind of looks like the bait on the hook that caught me on my caught my attention on this this little thought i want everybody to relax tonight this is not going to be deep and i don't i don't expect that it's going to take a whole lot of time asia my 10 year old shia me always ask me dad how many pages of notes do you have asia says what most of us are thinking about she goes oh yeah anyways but just relax tonight we're we're in in the presence of friends and i just want to say good evening friends but in this uh in this message taking sites we're in a time of taking sides i uh i started to watch the i started to watch the presidential debates they're gonna do this all night long they want to know what what position are you on are you going for president trump or for uh uh vice president biden they're you know who's right i think our pastor the other days uh said we're in a world that nobody wants to give an inch that's i'm tired of not trusting it has gotten wary this nation is pulling itself apart because we can't trust one another the new world order is distrust is [Music] lack of confidence and leadership it seems like the ministry is not trusted anymore what is it it's the spirit of the day that we live in the spirit everybody's pointing their fingers that's the other person or at the other side and nobody's willing to point the finger at themselves that's the way it is today nobody wants responsibility it's always somebody else's fault i believe it's time that we stop pointing fingers i believe it's time to take a look in the mirror of god's word stop and see how our lines our lives line up to that that's what's mattering tonight it doesn't matter what somebody else thinks what somebody else says what does god's word say see how i line up to god's word get myself in order stop looking at everybody else stop measuring your life by how others raided you that's where we're at we're always looking at the ratings well he's got five stars within a sequence you got a thousand followers for a million followers i found out on amazon careful with the ratings because people will sign you up and you'll do and they'll send you a product and then they'll say thank you for your good rating gracias when when rating and you didn't order the product you don't even know careful with the ratings that's what i do i always look to see this product product here it's got five stars but it's difficult because somehow we believe that if we're on the right side because of the virtue by default god's got to be on that side you like something that our president abraham lincoln said you know if you don't like the way it tastes you know like gustavo just plug your nose and take it anyways this is god's word we're talking about here we're not playing games god doesn't side with man it's our sir it's not my cons my concern is not whether god is on our side my greatest concern is that it's to be on god's side taking sides with jesus the bible says in proverbs 3 verses 5 through 6 if you would let's stand for the reading of god's word when the guys in the back have it they can see you man okay we'll go ahead uh proverbs 3 5 and 6. he says trust there's that word trust in the lord with all thine heart trust in the lord and his name is the lord jesus christ we like to make whose lives are compatible with the holy ghost but they're not of the same nature say that again there's those that believe they are is not the same as being original being incompatible is not being original compatible you can go down to the parts store and you need a part of your car uh the ones that built that motor that knows everything about it they built the part can buy that one they're expensive or you can buy a compatible part from you know where and they're compatible but they're not original ask yourself tonight am i just compatible ask yourself that i haven't asked myself my am i just a cheap knockoff or am i original do i have the nature of a compatible thing or do i have the nature of the original was the word and the word was with that there's perfect strength and perfect and when he became upside down so we're going to say something that might be a little sting to some of the preachers but perfectly that we have a god called man in this congregation we have a god called man that we should trust please don't get me wrong with what i'm about to say if it's someone other than the man christ jesus christ then we got something wrong somewhere along the lines and he yelled christ he one of the greatest lessons that i've learned that he will give you the gift of the holy ghost to get himself out of the way so that we should get ourselves out of the way i point the finger down god needs get ourselves out of the way so that the lord has preeminence in the lives of his people we're going to give you some bible for that we can wait for a second here because we want to read it together first peter five one two three the elders which are among you i exhort regulars and also a partaker of the glory that shall be revealed or where and don't have trust or confidence so what happens when we start thinking about something too much our pastor has preached some pretty good messages on this pastor we think about things too much maybe it's about how we're going to handle our children if it's about how we're going to make ends meet in our household maybe it's just about something that we just really got to have we start to figuring everything out why okay why do we want to figure things out because because i want to be right and we think that somehow we can understand something then the better chances are that we that we're right i'm sure you have plenty of examples in your life you want to be right about something and i sure do too s can you but just stop leaning on what you know about it [Music] stop leaning on that and it's a it's a it's a handicap if you're a christian impediment if you were playing golf they would give you a big old handicap because as we lean on our own understanding but when we lean on our own now you got to pay attention to this part i'm going to repeat this so we remember i got to make sure i say it right because when we lean to our own understanding we think that [Music] how this leaning thing works here about three of you young men right there it was convenient they're right there there's three guys just about the right size come on up don't worry about social distancing right now i don't have a mask but you guys are covering me you got three of them so come on up and just stuff let's see uh jojo why don't you stand right here and uh go ahead and face the audience there scoot over this way just a little bit yeah okay ethan you can stand right here and no you can stand right here okay here we are right here this is a esta christian this is one of god's sons right here i believe that this this young man is one of god's children good boy thank you for helping uh let's see what's the right okay okay so this is jojo's understanding right here go just a little bit so so you can see and you know what uh go walking just walk over there you can follow him uh jojo's understanding okay you guys can turn around walk back this way and the understanding it's just got to follow along that's what our understanding should do our understanding should should be following the same way that the lord is following is is leading us but when you don't trust the lord and then you lean to your own understanding because when your understanding fails there you go and you're going to fall so that's why it's important now stand here again the lord never left the lord's always been here always but the bible says i am the lord thy god and i changed god when i gave you something i don't have to learn it anymore if you did you won't be god he doesn't have to learn new things our understanding has to learn new things with him he gives you the best that you cannot possibly have already you don't gotta try and go figure nothing out thank you gentlemen thank you so much for for the help [Applause] again the lord can be on our side and most horrible death that a man could live one on either side of him on the one side and jesus was on his side on the one side the man said if you're the son of god bring yourself down from that tree and the lord was on his side too and he said this man has done nothing wrong i deserve to be here he does not deserve to be here those are the things that keep our mind in order i deserve to be on this cross it doesn't deserve to be there you want to still keep leaning on your own understanding us this might seem a little bit off of a awful mark right now man this made my heart sing so this is the message taking sides with jesus in 1962 we're going to start with paragraph 30. what if god would have told john the revelator now it's going to be 2 000 years before my coming oh john would have come back and told the church well i guess it might you might as well eat drink and be married because there are going to be many generations jesus ain't coming for 2 000 years millennials do you have foreign if you don't understand what god's prophet said you will never understand what our founding pastor said because after all aspirations because it ain't going to hinder one thing you're going to be right there on time you're going to be right there on time anyhow he says ben see what i mean it will be just as fresh as if they were right there in the battle and we've got to be looking for him right now right now even we don't know it could possibly be that it'd be a hundred years from now it would be 500 years from now as if we've just fallen asleep like he might be like he might come the next minute because it might be the end of your life at that minute you don't know when you're going this may be some of your last breath now to carry on now to carry on further how many want to carry on further tonight i don't want to stay where i am i want to keep going carry on further it then john wouldn't have known how to follow if john had enough going on polycarp wouldn't have known how to follow him if polycarp of god went on the eva irenaeus wouldn't have known how to follow if irene is one of known and wouldn't have went on martin wouldn't have known how to follow [Music] you can just bow your heads tonight there's someone here that wants to rededicate their lives to the lord jesus christ [Music] [Music] hand the lord already saw el senor he already knows by this you acknowledged lord jesus we're thankful tonight for your word for god for allah not that it was a man but by by the word is it is it scriptural that the word of the lord comes to the prophet that is your order tonight that is the way you work [Music] and the gates of hell [Music] lord may we trust lord jesus and what you have placed in what you have promised that under an apostolic call upon that we are to repent be baptized every one [Music] may god bless you [Applause] [Music] oh what a blessedness and what a peace is mine i'm leaning on the everlasting leaning [Music] leaning i'm safe and secure from all along i'm leaning on the everlasting one leaning on the everlasting arm and oh how bright the path grows from day to day leaning on the everlasting to just praise him tonight oh i'm late i'm leaning i'm safe and secure from all along oh and what have i to dread what have i to fear leaning on the everlasting arm oh i have blessed peace with my lord so near leaning on the everlasting on all your heart whoa i'm leaning i'm leaning i'm leaning i'm leaning on the everlasting off amen don't you just love the lord [Music] i'm gonna just want to worship him a little bit for the word that he's given us in such simplicity amen let's sing that song brother will the great emancipator amen he set us free from the binding chains of sin and we're here tonight by his grace and his mercy oh how i love him that's the song of the [Music] redeemed [Music] glory [Music] hallelujah bless your name lord that's the god that i serve tonight always there to worship him in spirit and it's true can you sing glory glory hallelujah [Music] his holy name oh he's a great emancipator and that's the song of the redeemed i don't know if this was you but it was me [Music] was [Music] [Music] [Music] my father's home he's waiting for you tonight oh blessed be your holy name [Music] [Music] and that's the song of the redeemed now if you're redeemed let's sing this last verse so thankful for your murder are you thankful for that mercy [Music] and his grace that lifted me [Music] whoa he alone has made me worse that's the key tonight him alone oh now [Music] oh glory glory his holy name [Music] and unto the lord redeemed by the blood of the lamb redeemed [Music] how i love to proclaim redeemed by the blood of the lamb reading through his infinite mercy his child and forever i am worried reading reading by the blood of the lamb [Music] i know that a crown there awaits me and a mansion he prepared for me
