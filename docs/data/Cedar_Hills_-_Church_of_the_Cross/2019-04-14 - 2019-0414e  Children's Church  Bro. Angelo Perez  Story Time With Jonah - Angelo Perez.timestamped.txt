[9:22] transgressions and he was sorry he was
[9:30] bruised for our iniquities the
[9:36] translations of our peace was upon him
[9:42] and with His stripes we are healed
[9:47] before I begin I would like to thank the
[9:52] Lord and all my brothers and sisters for
[9:54] prank for me and I I just got I don't
[9:58] like you know we say gee in my throat I
[10:03] would like to talk about God's healing
[10:06] power today how how many here believe in
[10:13] healing amen
[10:17] God has yet God has guard every huge
[10:23] healed you God is the only one who can
[10:30] heal not a man only God whenever I was
[10:36] just a baby
[10:37] I was sick and ended up in the hospital
[10:40] for a couple of weeks I was born with a
[10:45] just order called the meckel's
[10:48] diverticulum which means a the end of my
[10:55] stomach and in the beginning of my
[11:00] intestines were knotted up together
[11:02] causing a blockage and was deadly my mom
[11:07] didn't find out until I was 10 months
[11:10] old the doctor who diagnosed me said one
[11:19] in a million people were diagnosed with
[11:22] this disorder every year I was rushed to
[11:29] a possible Children's Hospital
[11:31] and immediately on underwent to Sergey
[11:37] and I and to remove the not a few days
[11:43] later the in it where they fixed it up
[11:50] it reopened and I and on the inside and
[11:56] again I underwent so I need to close it
[11:59] back up and so you can put up the
[12:02] pictures up there for me the next one
[12:08] that kid right there he was good-looking
[12:12] even though he was sick I'm thankful to
[12:19] the Lord for completely healing me from
[12:22] that to this day I have never suffered
[12:27] from that disorder see
[12:29] so sometimes we get sick so God can
[12:34] manifest his glory but we were all born
[12:39] sick because the Bible tells us that we
[12:42] are born in sin and shaped in in in in
[12:49] sorry and that we comment to the world
[12:56] speaking lies so we need God to heal us
[13:00] it did it it doesn't matter how good you
[13:05] are
[13:06] we still need medicine which is God in
[13:12] our hearts in second kings five there
[13:18] was a character in the Bible named naman
[13:26] and he too sick he was sent to Elisha
[13:34] the prophet a prophet is the mouthpiece
[13:41] of God the Prophet sent
[13:44] him too instructions for his healing but
[13:50] when he heard the extractions of the
[13:53] prophet sends him he was angered because
[13:57] he was not expecting to what to hear
[14:01] that he was the you when you he was
[14:11] wanting his miracle but God would rather
[14:14] heal his children then give them a
[14:18] miracle because a miracle it take you
[14:23] know you don't have to believe God does
[14:24] it and killing it take it you have to
[14:29] believe in it in order for you to get
[14:31] healed so that's what man had to do we
[14:47] have to do is thank you and God bless
[15:40] you
[15:41] [Applause]
[16:17] now I need all of the little children
[16:20] they could come up and sit right around
[16:23] here it's going to be storytime with
[16:26] Jonah
[16:39] all right perfect
[16:47] oh you guys don't fit perfect careful
[16:49] and I'm gonna fall
[16:55] all righty I pretty much just give it
[16:58] away but how many of you can guess who I
[17:00] am
[17:01] John John Jonas right my name is Jonah
[17:05] and I'm the son of Emmett I does anyone
[17:10] here know my story
[17:12] you good heard my story before yeah
[17:15] you have my story my book I wrote a book
[17:19] Wow okay well to start I am a prophet of
[17:27] the Lord but there's something different
[17:30] about me than all the other prophets and
[17:34] we're gonna get into that a little bit
[17:35] here I'm here to share with you my
[17:39] experience what I went through some
[17:43] pretty nasty things it smelt really
[17:45] fishy for three days and three nights I
[17:49] did so to start there was a day when
[17:56] God's voice came to me and he said Jonah
[17:59] I have a job for you to do there's a
[18:03] city called Nineveh and their wickedness
[18:06] mommy knows what wickedness is that evil
[18:14] yeah exactly
[18:16] so I said this city is wicked and it's
[18:20] come up before me I need you to go and
[18:22] cry out against it this city was full of
[18:27] people doing bad things instead of
[18:30] serving God all they wanted to do was
[18:32] watch TV or play video games or talk
[18:35] back to their parents yeah does that
[18:38] sound familiar
[18:39] no oh yeah I thought so I thought it
[18:42] does often movie Oh exactly yeah okay
[18:50] and my only job my only job it was
[18:55] simple was just to go cry out against it
[18:59] sorry my mustache keeps falling
[19:03] that's simple right God calls you to cry
[19:06] out against something
[19:07] doesn't that sound so simple okay Lord
[19:10] I'll cry out against it my children I
[19:13] made a great great mistake I mean owes
[19:18] my mistake that I made oh I didn't want
[19:23] to go that's exactly right
[19:24] I did so I fled from the presence of God
[19:33] when I heard his voice I just I couldn't
[19:35] do it said no Lord I can't do it and I
[19:39] found a ship that was leaving this place
[19:42] so I even paid money yeah I paid money
[19:46] to get on the ship and I left I don't
[19:49] want to be nowhere near the presence of
[19:51] God yeah I did
[19:55] but kids let me tell you something very
[19:59] very true if you remember anything from
[20:03] this story remember this if you ever do
[20:06] anything wrong you talk bad about
[20:09] someone or you do maybe something you're
[20:12] not supposed to do just remember until
[20:16] you make it right you'll never be able
[20:19] to run away from it take it from me I
[20:22] tried running from the Lord but it
[20:24] didn't work yeah exactly he knows
[20:29] everything and he always sees you
[20:31] because he's God that's right so God
[20:35] knew exactly where I was and he made
[20:38] sure to get ahold of me does anyone here
[20:41] have their Bible yeah okay yes
[20:49] oh no I didn't have fun okay do you want
[20:55] to read from me Jonah one for
[21:12] you learn to read it out of mine I'm
[21:15] gonna read it out of mine
[21:26] one for right there
[21:32] but the Lord sent out a great wind into
[21:36] the sea and there was a my mighty am
[21:40] tempest in the sea so the ship was like
[21:43] to be broken yes sir that's right so
[21:48] what happened was to get a hold of me
[21:51] the Lord knew who I was I was on this
[21:54] ship I fled I paid money to get out of
[21:56] there and I was being disobedient so the
[21:59] Lord he sent a mighty wind and these
[22:03] winds were strong I was in the middle of
[22:06] the ocean the waves as tall as his
[22:09] building maybe even taller everything
[22:12] was just going mad
[22:13] the ship was getting full of water it
[22:15] was gonna sink everyone was grabbing
[22:17] everything they can to throw it off of
[22:19] the ship so we wouldn't sink but guess
[22:22] where I was at the whole time now I was
[22:24] sleeping at the bottom of the ship that
[22:27] doesn't sound too good I know yeah I
[22:31] didn't say there were sharks eh I bet
[22:34] there were sharks in there so when I was
[22:39] asleep the captain of the ship he came
[22:41] down to where I was he said hey you
[22:46] sleepyhead
[22:47] call upon your God so he can remember us
[22:49] and we can be saved yeah and I woke up
[22:52] and the crew found out and they started
[22:56] asking me questions said what's your job
[22:59] when did you even get on the ship where
[23:01] am i from whose people do you belong to
[23:04] so I stood up and I said I'm a Hebrew
[23:08] and I fear the Lord the God of heaven
[23:12] the same one that created this sea and
[23:16] the dry land and I told him that I was
[23:19] running from his presence and when I did
[23:23] they all got really scared
[23:24] they knew hey you don't mess with the
[23:28] Lord Jesus mm-hmm you don't mess with
[23:31] God and said why did you do this what
[23:37] could we do to make the ocean and the
[23:39] Seas and the winds what can we do to
[23:41] make them calm down so we don't get hurt
[23:44] and I stood up
[23:46] I said throw me into the waters this is
[23:49] all my fault
[23:50] because of me you all might die but
[23:53] throw me overboard in the the waters
[23:55] will calm down you see it was me that
[23:58] God wanted God didn't want any of them
[24:02] or he wasn't after any of them but he
[24:05] was after me yeah I do any of you guys
[24:09] have siblings at home like brothers and
[24:11] sisters yeah you have a brother so let
[24:19] me ask you a question when you get in
[24:20] trouble at home sometimes does it make
[24:23] your brother and sister get in trouble
[24:24] too yeah when you do something bad and
[24:29] then your brother or sister winds up in
[24:31] the mess too yeah and I remember when I
[24:36] was little yeah my parents would spank
[24:42] me and then my sister and my brother
[24:43] would cry too just because I was crying
[24:45] so that's what happened here I got in
[24:51] big trouble and because of my
[24:54] disobedience and because of me not
[24:57] wanting to listen to God everyone else
[25:00] around me was in the same mess and I
[25:03] don't want that do you guys want your
[25:04] brothers and sisters to be in trouble
[25:06] with you all the time
[25:07] No so they casted me into the water and
[25:13] immediately the water stopped calm down
[25:16] the waves just fell everything was calm
[25:20] but before they casted me in we know my
[25:25] brother branham that they tied my ankles
[25:27] they bound me by my feet they bound me
[25:30] by my hands and then they throw me into
[25:32] the water and we weren't on the shore by
[25:35] a beach with ice cream cones on the side
[25:37] I was in the middle of the ocean no
[25:41] clouds it was hot so I started to just
[25:45] float there in the water and guess what
[25:47] God was doing this whole time he was
[25:49] creating a fish a big fish
[25:54] yeah it was like a whale and this fish
[25:58] and it came and swallowed me up you know
[26:02] what if it went when a fish eats you
[26:04] know what it does after it eats it
[26:07] digest and it goes all the way to the
[26:09] bottom and it just sits there and it
[26:11] digests whatever it just ate so that's
[26:15] where I was at all because I didn't want
[26:17] to listen I was in the belly of a big
[26:20] fish well and I was at the bottom of the
[26:23] ocean pitched back no light it was dark
[26:27] it was cold it was clammy and it's not
[26:31] like fish really bad I didn't eat no
[26:35] fish new fish I think hmm
[26:41] so I was in the belly of this fish for
[26:45] three days and for three nights
[26:47] this whole time just looking around all
[26:50] I could see was the belly of this fish
[26:52] so I started to feel in my heart I knew
[26:56] I was wrong so I started to cry out I
[26:58] said Lord everywhere I look all I see is
[27:02] the belly of this fish and I know I've
[27:04] done wrong here here my sincerity
[27:07] forgive me Lord
[27:08] and that my prayer God heard my
[27:11] sincerity he heard that that I knew I
[27:14] was wrong I said but let me look to your
[27:17] holy temple one more time and I'm
[27:22] looking to his holy temple and God heard
[27:24] me he heard my heart and the fish came
[27:27] back up to shore and yeah he threw up
[27:33] and I guess what came out I came out of
[27:36] the fish's mouth with all throw-up so
[27:46] that was pretty much my story not to get
[27:51] into too much details I want to hold you
[27:53] guys too long but I do have some goodie
[27:57] bags and I have questions to see if
[28:01] everyone was listening all right first
