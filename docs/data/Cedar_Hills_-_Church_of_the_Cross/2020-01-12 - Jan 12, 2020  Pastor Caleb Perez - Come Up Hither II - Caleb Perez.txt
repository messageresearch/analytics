despina what later here my goodness we would stop for nothing then open area most Parnassus to Pyramus cane as we get into this message there was a story about a scientist have you any story of even scientific had an aviator you know yea though this was back in the 1860s mr. Fuentes they went up in a gas balloon went on the noon and don't glow or they gas and there was a couple of reasons why they went up he have you not a son is por que sube I don't number one they wanted to break the record hey on current record for for the highest ascent of a gas balloon as and in Sierra Leone globally gasps and then they were also up there to record to record some observations of of the weather yay Tamika Daniel's gonna run a dimple and come on I think at the time it was like the record was like twenty two thousand nine hundred feet or something like that in the air.you record this we didn't like was he well as they began to ascend emit a thousand personas and there they they got to that level in I don't know anything and and they couldn't go no higher yeah yeah no matter what what's happening he looked around they're looking at all the stuff they brought him you know they're either glaze big old machines that they brought do these observations everyone else but I set up set up a steel and after a while they realized they were too heavy to go any higher machines that they that they are taken up there is a máquina yucky all right well all they could do was sorry whoever's down there but this fence entire in Turkey they started throwing stuff off the balloon and persona things that way did the blue down Chris's killer little by little they're gonna slap again logo on persona send their Pro till they got to a then record-breaking 37,000 feet up into the air that's the case here on that link they see at the mill PS yeah but the problem was in Peru Lima as they began to ascend in intercept is honest in there and and and the media meteorologist began to put down his observations yet come serve our yes yellows upon tests he realized that that in different different at different heights it's a joke winter care as if it interests and to dance he realized that the wind speeds are different that right brother brother Henry laughs well I must be different so he began to write that down yes ice QB they saw and as I began to get higher and higher the air began to get thinner and thinner yep it's on us to be the mastery latest on my oxygen that he got less and less you look sick you know Aramis Mateos and the cold gets colder and colder he'll stop or endo marsalano cannabis as he got to a certain place hasta que he goes here to lugar they began to freeze to death episode on a conquerer see Hill without oxygen in the cold Sina oxy can't no Arenado they had looked at wanting to break the record so bad okay Yankee record and say that I mean they forgot to prepare themselves for what was up there they didn't know que no se preparan a Yas bananas and then I II as they were freezing to death one of them passed out mysticum who knows my own and I believe that one of them I believe it was the meteorologist that passed out Iker can Phil and Kay punt on you know I must be aviator his fingers they got frostbite you know violence - a listicle he ended up having to with his teeth l took on Suzie and hold the Rope that opened up the top flew okay don't carry a la riva so that the gas could get let me let out so that they could come back down but analyte if I keep on bhajana they realize as as great a feat that they had accomplished again bestow look again look now though they were not prepared to be up there in the heaven this time I'm preparin Mantinea you know as I was as I was reading this and looking at this story is the story I thought about how tremendous it is in the spiritual even if you have yoga Tantra min because everything that goes on in the natural we understand is a type of the spiritual porque lo que pasa not relent and demos and I asked the question this this morning are we really prepared to to ascend into the heavens prepare us for us and we're really ready to to fight the good fight the higher you go the more Devils there are entry must move it must a more sort of higher you go it there must be no more winds of doctrines you run into the guard must be higher you go the colder it becomes it must do we must allow us and that's why the Bible says that many many are called few are chosen this is Lavinia Corazon muchos on your mouse key focuses and a man said one day many are cold and few are frozen in the phenomena rest which assists an LLC Pakistan coup hello that's the love of many that has wax cold today a still a more than witch's kiss every other but I'm here to tell you something I'm thankful to God that he sent a prophet mr.
