[28:09] amen amen you may be seated
[28:13] amen it's my privilege to introduce the
[28:15] word tonight
[28:18] amen we'll be watching dvd
[28:21] of our founding pastor brother thomas
[28:23] petty senior
[28:24] nurturing the body spirit and soul
[28:28] number five hope you're ready for a good
[28:30] one tonight man
[29:25] say there is no resurrection
[29:29] neither angel nor spirit
[29:32] but the pharisees confess both
[29:38] resurrection
[29:49] for the wonderful rain that you gave us
[29:51] here in this state
[30:03] we pray that you bless brother peter and
[30:05] his wife wherever they
[30:20] put me aside
[30:33] when you see the bible here on the
[30:36] services
[30:40] and the pharisees
[30:43] they were the two religious groups
[30:46] in the times of jesus
[31:15] so when that happened
[31:20] you'll notice that there was a great
[31:22] dissension
[31:30] amen amen so then we want to continue
[31:34] with the spirit continue
[31:38] and in the spirit in the spirit
[31:42] we we might say that a lot of people uh
[31:46] don't understand what the spirit is
[31:51] in the first place when god
[31:55] made man in athena
[32:06] when he created him
[32:10] he created him in his image
[32:15] now the image of god
[32:18] is not meant like
[32:22] it's a spirit
[32:25] man has the
[32:29] [Music]
[32:53] it looks just like a woman because
[32:57] the the part that we see right now
[33:04] is not the
[33:06] image of the god
[33:10] of god is spirit like
[33:13] now the sacrifice didn't believe that
[33:16] there was
[33:16] such a thing as angels nor spirits nor
[33:20] resurrection
[33:22] [Music]
[33:36] there wasn't a resurrection why do i
[33:38] want to come to jerusalem
[33:41] once a man dies that's that's it
[33:45] but we believe there is a resurrection
[33:49] we believe there is a spirit that was
[33:51] called
[33:52] and we also believe there is an angel
[33:57] now in this part this morning
[34:01] i want to deal with what we inherit
[34:05] as far as a nature or character
[34:09] of our parents
[34:16] because we understand that
[34:19] that a lot of times in church or
[34:22] wherever we are we we have problems
[34:29] and truthfully if you analyze the thing
[34:35] you you really don't have problems with
[34:37] anyone
[34:39] [Music]
[34:40] if you analyze it it's really your own
[34:43] personal problems
[35:11] maybe it comes through inheritance for
[35:14] an identity
[35:26] my father was a carpenter my father
[35:30] and to me there was no better
[35:34] carpenter in the world than my father
[35:38] one day i don't know how old i was
[35:41] because we used to help him
[35:46] [Laughter]
[35:55] and the lady was not pleased with the
[35:57] work that he had done
[36:01] and i already heard her say he did
[36:05] nothing but a mess
[36:09] i could have gone inside the home and
[36:13] choked that lady
[36:17] because i was protecting
[36:20] my father and my father and in my genes
[36:37] my father is
[36:47] i want you to notice and i'm going to go
[36:49] slow because it's
[36:50] going to be escalating the
[37:15] he says the whole human race is
[37:32] physical beings of our body is tearing
[37:36] down
[37:36] like that from eating high breed
[37:39] fruits
[37:41] [Music]
[37:45] tensions that ratner last
[38:03] you have to stop right here
[38:06] and meditate a lot of times
[38:10] we read and we have we we obtain a lot
[38:13] of head knowledge
[38:16] much
[38:43] and i have to know what that means
[38:45] before i can proceed to another verb
[38:51] but notice here it says that the brain
[38:55] cell
[38:55] is all also rot because of the hybrid
[39:05] [Applause]
[39:21] [Music]
[39:25] you know today it seems
[39:29] like the children uh the part meow the
[39:32] way i almost said like
[39:34] it seems like the children are smarter
[39:38] in a way they are
[40:10] [Music]
[40:31] [Music]
[40:36] of thinking
[41:02] because we are constantly hearing
[41:07] [Music]
[41:40] [Music]
[42:00] in other
[42:14] not one
[42:28] but this sister hears this other woman
[42:31] say that
[42:32] [Music]
[42:34] and she's not thinking right
[42:37] she doesn't have a thinking man's
[42:42] filthier
[42:52] [Music]
[42:56] so let me read this again
[43:03] does not all does not that also rock the
[43:06] brain cell
[43:24] get her two little children
[43:29] put him tie them with seat belts
[43:33] drive to the lake and send them into the
[43:37] lake
[43:38] tell
[43:57] [Music]
[44:20] can
[44:34] [Music]
[44:35] this is the way people think
[44:38] people can say a big lie in front of you
[44:42] and not better now
[44:47] they they live with
[45:30] some drugs and some things to be able to
[45:33] control their emotions and things
[45:43] and when a brain cell begins to rot
[45:51] the whole world not only this nation
[45:56] but everywhere mentally
[46:12] horrendous
[46:14] [Music]
[46:34] let me read again they'll imagine
[46:36] they're seeing
[46:37] ends the size of a mountain
[46:51] [Applause]
[47:32] [Music]
[47:36] women who are they tremendous
[48:11] but we should do the very best that we
[48:14] can
[48:15] to to receive in ourselves the very mess
[48:18] that we
[48:32] with long hair to turn to torment woman
[49:14] and the hair was given for recovery
[49:20] and if i could show you
[49:23] i'll show you the hair
[49:28] and you begin to cut a little bit of
[49:29] this off
[49:32] right a little bit from here you share a
[49:35] little bit from here
[49:40] all right here like woman hanging down
[49:47] and long teeth like a lion
[49:50] this is his brother
[49:55] these stingers in their tail
[50:23] my sister says
[50:38] i
[50:53] amen amen now
[50:56] prophet keeps on speaking
[51:00] and we'll we're going to go into these
[51:02] realms or these cycles
[51:05] say amen he said
[51:08] the inside of that man is a man
[51:12] or the inside of that man is a man
[51:14] called spirit
[51:19] and he has five senses
[51:22] and i would like to to do this
[51:26] and put in the realms
[51:32] that this is
[51:39] [Music]
[51:48] which
[52:27] [Applause]
[52:29] that's why the bible says
[52:36] now this spirit este espirito
[52:39] also has five sentences
[52:44] the
[52:58] he
[53:12] is
[53:21] [Applause]
[53:25] he actually is
[53:47] [Music]
[53:52] and it's impossible in an hour and a
[53:54] half that's what i'm going to say
[53:57] [Music]
[53:58] but it's impossible to cover the whole
[54:02] thing
[54:04] but let me let me go back a little bit
[54:09] [Music]
[54:15] now there is where
[54:19] many christians only stop
[54:35] with the same holy spirit
[55:05] [Music]
[55:12] [Music]
[55:19] today so confused about the evidence of
[55:22] the holy ghost
[55:26] and so forth satan
[55:29] can impersonate any kind of a gift
[55:38] he says but he cannot bring that word
[55:42] word by words
[56:22] [Applause]
[56:30] [Applause]
[56:42] is
[56:56] think a little bit
[57:14] [Applause]
[57:21] [Applause]
[57:27] [Applause]
[57:43] [Applause]
[58:17] [Applause]
[58:34] sleep i guess i have
[58:38] a nervous there's a nervous condition in
[58:41] my house
[58:44] i want to make sure
[58:58] when god spoke the word did you ever
[59:01] hear god
[59:02] speak the word
[59:11] and the gospel must first be published
[59:16] among all
[59:18] [Applause]
[59:28] [Applause]
[59:43] god wanted us
[59:51] [Applause]
[1:00:10] [Applause]
[1:00:18] [Applause]
[1:00:25] [Applause]
[1:00:26] that's the result
[1:00:40] and i believe
[1:00:54] it brought death
