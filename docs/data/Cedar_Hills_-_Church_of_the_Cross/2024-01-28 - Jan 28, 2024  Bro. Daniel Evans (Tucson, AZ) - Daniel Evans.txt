would look down and be pleased upon our congregation may the great Holy Spirit dwell here this morning may it be welcome bless this service father we pray in Jesus name amen amen amen God bless you all while I have you standing let's turn in our Bible is the book of The Beloved disciple St John 10 verse it says this as the father knoweth me even so know I the father and I lay down my life for the sheep and other sheep I have which are not of this fold them also I must bring and they shall hear my voice and there shall be one fold and one Shepherd amen God bless you you can take your seat one Shepherd and one fold how different that is that that the world teaches us today we've got our little group there in Tucson Arizona and that's part of the f and I send greetings friends from the Tucson Tabernacle Tabernacle I know they all wanted to come but uh we we um we had another brother come in to preach this morning a brother that you all know or many of you know him his name is brother Ryan long Ryan and brother Ryan brother Ryan sends his greetings also we um the excuse that we had to come is we went through a lot of the storage at the Tucson Tabernacle and we have all kinds of message books from brother Brandon so we brought a bunch of boxes with us to give to brother Tommy and brother Caleb to send overseas to ug [Applause] but uh but we kept brother Caleb we kept quite a few of them back so we can come on another trip so we'll just keep bringing them and bringing them as long as there's one thing that brother brandham there's there's a lot of different doctrines about brother brandham and his ministry that that the world right now but one thing that we know for sure brother Bram wanted his message to go overseas and that's something that we can all come together on and it's it's sad that that even though we this should be something that we can come together on Satan has used it as many things to divide us but brother Caleb we are 100% behind you and brother Tommy and what you all are doing may God bless you and what you're doing continue to bless we were uh when I lived in Jeffersonville few years ago when we were all together at voice of God Recordings one one day and the power went out so we weren't able to use our our computer so we all congregated in the largest room in the building and Brother Joseph and brother Billy Paul were were sitting on the table and all of us were gathered around maybe 50 people and Brother Joseph tells brother Billy he says Billy tell us a story about dad bil bil and brother Billy Paul said something now never forget he said that I was the closest person to brother brandom in the world he said I traveled the world with brother Brana he said I was always in service with him I drove him around in the car he said he shared with me the most inner thoughts that he had and he said even me brother brandom's son with him all the time he said even I did not know the difference between his friends and his enemies he said he spoke the same about everyone even to those that were closest to him and I still think Lord where is that in my life how many times do I share with my wife or my son when when somebody upsets me and I speak evil even inside the innermost chambers of my house even though those things may be true but it doesn't need to be said division friends is is created by Satan himself and he has robbed God's Children of their unity and their love for each other and it even goes down into our home that unity in the church it starts in our home in our family I tell a story about my wife the Lord blessed me with a good wife I see fear come into her eyes right now I um I like to drink Coke Zero so I would drink my Coke Zero and I would only drink half of it and I would put the other half in the refrigerator to to keep it cold to keep it fizzy and almost always I would come back to my refrigerator to get my Coke Zero I would open the door and there would be my Coke Zero and I would pick it up and it would be empty there' be nothing in my Coke Zero my wife would drink it and she would put the empty can back in the refrigerator and it upset me so I took my Coke Zero and I drank the whole thing and I took the can and I filled it half full of milk and I put it back in the refrigerator she would learn a lesson and my wife wife learned a valuable lesson that day as did I from that moment on from my cero can I drank everything from hot sauce the vinegar the buttermilk anything you can imagine what good did it do me to do that to my wife how would you like to be married to a woman like that for friends it doesn't do any good to fight it doesn't do any good to argue when I when I was in Jeffersonville a brother came from down in Tennessee Jeffersonville tene his name is Tom Jennings Tom Jennings he was an old man and his family went way back with brother braham's message in Florida he he and his family were a member back in the 40s and 50s he and his family were members of the Assembly of God denomination and they had heard of this man William brandham that would come through Florida and heal the sick so his father had had a heart condition so they went to William bram's meetings and brother brandham called him out of the audience told him he had a heart condition and then the Lord healed him but this man was a trustee in this Assembly of God Church so he kept it a secret that he was following this man William brandom around Florida he said because if they were to hear that he was following him around Florida they would kick him out of the church so his pastor his wife was deadly deathly sick with cancer caner so this brother Jennings goes to the pastor and he says I've had this experience with this man William brand he said you need to bring your wife to these meetings and she will be healed but the pastor couldn't do this because the Assembly of the Assemblies of God would always schedule a Revival whenever brother Brandon was going to be in in um in Florida florid in Miami Florida in Miami Florida so the pastor tells uh brother Jennings he says I I can't go because if I if I go there I'll come back and I won't have a church to come back to so brother Jennings says he says I'll take care of so he gets the trustees together and he says the pastors wife is is really sick and she's about to die and they're just it's been really hard on them and brother Jennings knew that brother Brandon was going to be in St Petersburg Florida in two weeks pburg so he gets the trustees together and he brings it before the church for a vote he said the Pastor needs a rest and his wife needs a rest I'd like a votee from the church to send the pastor to St Petersburg Florida for a little vacation P it was 100% vote so the pastor brings his wife to brother branham's meeting they bring his wife up to the platform in a cot strer yeah because because she couldn't walk brother brandom looks down at her during the meetings and he says sister you have cancer he said you're definely ill but you could see but he said let me tell you something else he said you are the wife of a pastor and he says let me tell you something else your husband is on the platform behind me and he says brother Jennings come down here and stand with your wife and he says and he gets him down there and he says let me tell you something that no one knows he says you have cancer of the mouth and he says will you both [Music] believe they both believe brother Brandon pray prayed for them and they were completely healed in the name of the Lord both of them lived to be old people his dad died at 96 years old came back to church and what he said was the truth word had gotten back to the church that called brother Jennings Innings they said you are no longer a trustee at this church and the pastor is no longer the pastor you see the division what if this church would accepted this man with this gift how much would the people have been blessed if they would have brought him in but his message did not line up with their denomination they did everything to keep him out do you see the UN there was no Unity there among Christian people and how much do we see that brothers and sisters today Satan has robbed us of our Unity you have a good church things are going well here I'd like to bring our church to to see this example that you all set but each person each person in this audience has a responsibility for that Unity one person in this audience could destroy that Unity and do you think Satan isn't working on it now seeing the blessing that you have Jesus in his last days he brought his disciples together we call it the Last Supper he he sent Judas away and here are his people and you can imagine the pressure that was on the Lord Jesus he knew that within 24 hours he was going to be gone and these were the people that were going to have to carry on his message so Jesus has them around the table and he's talking with them let's turning our Bible to St John 14 verse 15 Jesus says this he says if you love me keep my Commandments don't read o don't just read over that scripture what are Jesus's Commandments if someone smacks you in the face turn the other if someone steals your coat give him your other garment also he says pray for those that despitefully use you he says bless those that hate you it's easy to bless brother Caleb or bless bless brother Tommy Noah because they you know know they love you but what about those people that hate you Jesus said if you love me keep my Commandments love those people and I will abide and I will pray the father and he shall give you another comforter that he may abide with you forever even the spirit of Truth whom the world cannot receive because it seeth him not neither knoweth him but ye know him for he dwelleth with you and he shall be in you what is Jesus speaking of right there he shall be in you it was going to happen here in just a a couple weeks that the same spirit that was in Jesus Christ was going to come and dwell in flesh at the day of Pentecost in the form of the Holy Spirit and yet a little while and the world seeth me no more but you shall see me because I live you shall live also B he's talking around the supper table verse number 28 he says this you have heard how I said unto you I go away and I come again unto you if you love me you will rejoice because I said I go unto the father for my father is greater than I so he's saying that I'm going to leave you but you should Rejoice because the promise of the holy spirit is coming and that's going to be greater than just one man God in one man walking the earth now it's going to be God in men and women spreading the Earth with the same spirit that that man Jesus Christ had and now I have told you before it come to pass that when it has come to pass you might believe you might believe Hereafter I will not talk much with you for the prince of this world cometh and had ha nothing in me he's talking about a spirit that is going to come Judas John called Judas he called him a thief and a liar Judas may have killed himself friends but his Spirit never left he is still a thief and he steals not only he steals us of monetary things but he also steals of us of our joy and our love one from for another but that the world may know that I love the father and as the father gave me commandment even so I do arise and let us go ahead so what he's saying is they're sitting around the table and he says okay let's get up and let's go so they get up from the table and they start walking down the hill on the way down to the to the kidan valley and then when they get down to the bottom of the valley they go up a little space the next way and they get to a garden called gths so as they are walking down this Trail the Lord Jesus is preaching to them and teaching to them and he's trying to build something in this is the last sermon that he has with his disciples and he's trying to build something that will stay with them John 15 verse 7 as he's walking down he says if you abide in me and my words abide in you you shall ask what you will and it shall be done unto you he said here in is my father glorified that you bear much fruit so that you may be my disciples say and I ask all of us if we just consider ourselves Disciples of Jesus Christ what fruit are we bearing is it the fruit of division and hatred because our fruits tell us who we are or is it the fruit of love and unity let's go to the next chapter let's go to John 7 1 and this is my subject Jesus they got down to the bottom and he says okay he says now let's close in prayer you know how we close in prayer in service here is what Jesus is doing and he prayed over the disciples now listen to Christ's prayer for the church verse 17 he says this he says sanctify them through thy truth Thy word is truth he says as thou Hast sent me into the world even so have I also sent them into the world and for their their sakes I sanctify myself that they also might be Sanctified through the truth neither pray I for these alone but for them also which Shall Believe on me through their word right there Daniel Evans is written in the Bible Daniel EV and if you are a true Christian if you truly love the Lord there are you in the Bible we are the Fulfillment of this prayer that Christ prayed that we have heard this gospel and we have read what these disciples wrote in this word listen to this that they all may be one as thou father art in me and I in thee that they also may be one in us that the world may believe that thou has sent me and the glory which thou givest me I have given them that they may be one even as we are one I and them thou and me that they may be perfect in one and that the world may know that thou has sent me and has loved me and thou ha as thou Hast loved me thank you brother I read it wrong that they may be perfect in one and that the world may know that thou has sent me and Hast loved them as thou Hast loved me father I will also whom thou Hast given me be with me where I am that they may behold my glory which thou Hast given me for thou lovest me before the foundation of the world righteous father the world hath not known thee but I have known thee and these have known that thou Hast sent me and I have declared unto them thy name and will declare it that the love wherewith thou has loved me may be in them and I am them amen brothers and sisters prayer should mean a whole lot more to us this is the prayer of the Son of God and the Son of God is praying he's he's saying Lord that they may be one so that the world will know that I am the Messiah by their Unity their love one for another that they will know that Jesus Christ is God so how important is it for us to be unified in one and yet we let our tempers get rise up and we let little divisions come Among Us can you imagine Jesus with his disciples around praying Lord let them be one as you and I are one we know the godhead we have the revelation of the godhead we have the father and we have the son we have the Holy Spirit and we know from the prophet that these three are one and let me ask you how hard is it for you to separate the father from the son how hard is it for you and I to tell the difference between the father and the son and here is the Son of God saying Lord let them be one like you and I are one let them be so knit together that you can't tell a difference at all and this love that they have for one another is going to show Jesus Christ is alive and here we are in this day and you have people you have people coming in you have the churches growing but why is it growing it's growing because of the sheep that are in in this church and the love that they have one for another the world sees this love and that love introduces them to a living Jesus Christ it was Christ's prayer that this is how people would come into the message of the Hour come into Jesus Christ brother brother Caleb told me last night he said sheep produce sheep that's how the people come in it's not brother Caleb witnessing out out on the street it is the body operating in perfect Unity but it shouldn't be just limited to this church should be spreading it around the world brothers and sisters this is important this is the prayer of Jesus Christ himself then this prayer that Christ prayed began to manifest itself after Jesus died resurrected they were scared there was 120 of them in an upper room the Bible says they were in one place in one Accord what is one Accord they had a one purpose they had one thing that they were working towards there were different people there were different doctrines there were different personalities everything was different and what replaced conflict before now was there was one Accord to win souls to this man Jesus Christ you see the brothers going overseas and trying to help people it's something that we should be behind it's one Accord we should be agreeing on that then the Holy Spirit fell because they were in unity the Holy Spirit fell upon the group The Pillar of Fire was manifested there in those 120 people and then they went out in the unity of the gospel and in love Peter came to the man at the gate called Beautiful the first miracle man puts his hand out to get some money Peter says Silver and Gold Have I None but the love that was in Peter that that Unity of the Gospel that was in Peter he looked down on him and he said look at us he said look at me he said Silver and Gold Have I None but I have something that's far greater than any silver and gold for you he said in the name of Jesus Christ rise up he said what I have I give to you and he gave it to him the man jumped up and the gospel was spreading because of the unity one after the other the the the Bible says that the Lord added to the church daily and we're satisfied with one or two converts a year we should not be satisfied with that more and more Lord help these people get them to Jesus Christ there was so much Unity that they came together again in Acts chapter 4 the love between the disciples they had one Focus they had come off the streets where they had been persecuted remember Jesus said slap me in the face turn the other cheek they had been slapped in the face they had been persecuted they came together in the group and they rejoiced of their persecution that they got to suffer for the Lord and they were in such unity and in such love that the walls of the church shook they were of one heart and one Soul long for that day I long for that day to come brothers and I want it so bad they had it in the book of Acts but Satan was not going to let it stay he's a robber Stephanie and I and the kids when we were in Jeffersonville we went on a vacation we went just for the weekend one time we took our dog with us and when we came back we walked in the house and there was something wrong there was something different about our home there was an eerie creepy feeling inside of our house I can't explain it there was nothing out of order but someone had been there that Spirit of the enemy had come into our home and we started noticing things were missing my daughter had saved her money for forever since she was a little girl had it in her drawer she opened her drawer and her money was G little things in our home were missing that we wouldn't have even noticed the enemy had come in and robbed us and we didn't even noce notice we couldn't tell until certain things were missing and that is what happened here in the book of Acts we see they were in such Unity they had such love for one another but Satan the robber had crept in and started infiltrating into the church and stealing without people knowing he entered in and he started to take that Unity of the believer we can see it when Paul writes a letter to the Corinthian Church Satan had entered in and divided the Brethren and he said says this in 1 Corinthians chapter 1 he said Paul Paul to be an apostle of Jesus Christ to the will of God and S is our brother okay that word um Apostle is important when we go when we go somewhere when I come and I Minister this church to this church I am not operating in the name of an apostle I come here as a friend someone a minister to try to encourage you but my role is not to bring some Doctrine or some division into the church but when you operating under the office of an apostle then things are different and you are to bring that correction but here Paul is operating under the office of an apostle and he is bringing correction to this church now watch what he says now y'all are in school take English class is does anyone like writing like creative writing said no one of the one of the rules in writing is don't repeat yourself you say something in different ways you use pronouns in different words but if you repeat yourself over and over and over it sounds funny unless you are trying to make a very pronounced specific point Paul not only was a prophet and Apostle but he was also a very studied and learned man and a very good writer he says this Paul called to be an apostle of Jesus Christ through the will of God and SST our brother under the unto the Church of God which is that Corinth to them that are Sanctified in Christ Jesus called to be Saints with all that in every place call upon the name of Jesus Christ Our Lord both theirs and ours Grace be unto you and peace from God our Father and from the Lord Jesus Christ I thank my God always on your behalf for the grace of God which is given you by Jesus Christ that in everything you're enriched by him used the pronoun I know pronouns are big today but but Paul leaves nothing un undone here in all utterance and in all knowledge even as the testimony of Christ was confirmed in you so that you come behind in no gift waiting for the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ who shall also confirm you unto the end that you may be blameless in the day of our Lord Jesus Christ God is faithful by whom you were called into the fellowship of his son Jesus Christ Our Lord through his repetition he's making a very important point he's correcting them now I beseech you Brethren by the name of our Lord Jesus Christ that you speak the same thing and that there be no divisions among you but that you be perfectly joined together in the same mind and in the same judgment for it ha been declared unto me of you my brethren by them which are the house of Chloe that there are contentions among you now this I say that every one of you sayith I of Paul and I have Apollos and I have cph ch he says is Christ divided was Paul crucified for you or were you baptized in the name of Paul friends I feel it it's so often that we forget that the very people that these people that we are talking to are the very people that will one day make it into the kingdom and it's the seat of God that no matter how this person is raised or what church that they're raised in when they hear the Gospel of Jesus Christ of a living Jesus Christ in a personal relationship with him that they forsake everything and follow after this Christ Paul right here he's saying some of you are saying that you go to this church or you're from that church or you have this Doctrine or you have that Doctrine sound familiar doesn't it brother Caleb told me last night that he was he was in Poland and he told these brothers these pastors he said Brothers it's time to stop this bickering and we see we go right back here to First Corinthians and they were doing the same thing do you see the enemy had slipped in and stolen their unity and he's done the same to us brother brandom came and everything was great he pulled the church out of the denominational system but when he but when he said that he said listen he said there are believers in all of these denomination and we leave that part out of the message remember Jesus the quote that I read the beginning Jesus said there'll be one Shepherd and one fold and we remove that we we forget to say that so if you're talking to a Catholic or you're talking to a Baptist or you're talking to a Methodist and and those denominations are pretty much gone now except for Mama she's still there Catholic church but now it's mega churches and it's it's different these different large churches that are going around you might be talking to a son or a daughter of God so use caution in doing that Paul said later on when he in that letter Paul said he said some fast and they do it for the Lord he said some eat and they're doing for the he said some are circumcised and they're doing it for the Lord he said some are not circumcised and they're doing it for the Lord he said all things are for the Lord so friends if we eat we eat for the Lord if we drink we drink for the Lord if we're listening to tapes we're listening to tapes of the Lord if we're going to church we're going to church for the Lord if someone listens to their Pastor they are doing it for the Lord if someone feels that they should stay home and listening listen to a tape they are doing their best to do it for the Lord now if you're operating as an apostle if I was sent to go and correct something I might have a different thing to say because I'd be dealing with a specific group but here Paul is saying respect all of these other um angles on things and be careful about condemning other people just because they don't see it like you if we are truly to love one another as Jesus told us to do friends love requires sacrifice that's the thing that we forget it requires a sacrifice for me to love my children I have to be a good dad I have to do things that sometimes I don't want to do for their own good when when they were sacrificing the Bible they took the very best lamb and they took the very best bow and they sacrificed those things but they still kept their anger they still kept their inner thoughts they still kept their money they still kept their division they kept these other things they sacrificed their best but the Holy Spirit was not there in the individual to give their entire lives to God but things changed and now we have to give it all everything that's in you including your feelings sometimes including your religion if you don't see it a certain way back off let the Lord do the work friends the enemy has stolen our Unity you feel good here brother Tommy it's a good place to go to church the Lord has blessed you I love to come and fellowship with you all you know I love to be with you because I I can feed off of that unity and love that you have and it should be greater so that people if they walked into this building they say there's something different about this place I want what these people have wherever you go what whatever you do if you're in the store there's something about that woman I want what she has there's something about that man on the work site I want what he has and then they are introduced to Christ the Messiah it was his prayer PR that they would be one even as Christ and the father are one I don't believe he would have prayed it if it wouldn't if it wouldn't be possible it must be possible in this day and it must happen and we are not there yet the Bible says in Matthew 24 the very last this this end Time chapter it says the love of many shall wax cold and we we just live in this world like everything's normal it's oh I have love but we don't have that love we should seek that love brothers and sisters there is nothing greater and we should have patience with one another if we fail don't condemn someone I'm talking about your family your supper tap your home husbands and wives don't fill your wife's Coke Zero can up with milk look over the mistakes don't fight love the Lord say oh this is a this is a simple simple message then the simple message is what Christ prayed for his disciples we get too technical yeah I know the seals and they're wonderful and they're Revelation from God they they were prophesied to be revealed in this last day I get it I know I I I know that the the the ages in and all of these these different Revelations that came forward but why is most of what brother brandham preached is Jesus Christ and come out of that denominational system far more than anything else and yet we draw we still we when he left we draw the circles around each other and we'll draw the circle around our church and then we argue with some of the people in the church get offended so then we draw a circle inside the church and then we argue with our our wives and and fill our Coke can up with milk and we draw another Circle pretty soon I'm the only one standing in is that what was taught is that what Jesus Christ taught it's not what he taught he taught love one another and be one in the gospel brother brandom T I don't care if they're Methodist Catholic Baptist or whatever they are one in the gospel let me read to you something brother brandham said in closing brother Caleb I don't have I don't have enough time to read that one quote the the second quote is from the sign of the Messiah listen to this he said if Christ is the vine and his members of the church is the branches what ought you to find in the church The Works that I do shall you do also and More Than This shall you do for I go I go to my father that's what we should find we should find Miracles and we should find great signs and wonders and tongues and and these different gifts that's what we should find but what do you find when you go to church talking now right down to our circles we are the Presbyterian we are the we are the Baptist we are the Pentecost we got the message we got the message we're better than everyone else we have more of a revelation because Malachi 4 oh you know you're out you don't look like us you don't act like us we are the Elite that's not Christ Christ is love because he was [Applause] God have this this will all men know that you're my my disciples when you have love one for the other why would the prophet have said it that way maybe the anointing of the Holy Spirit was on him and the Holy Spirit was speaking of times to come and the ba Methodist and the Baptist and all that would be shrinking but there would be a group of people that put a name on themselves saying we are the message let me tell you something I am a disciple of the Lord Jesus Christ I love Jesus Christ and I am proud to say that God did send a prophet he sent a prophet to set things in order to tell us not to do those things but here comes Satan back in and he tries to he tries to ruin our unity and he's done a good job of it but there's a Remnant there's a group of people will raise up in perfect love and this prayer of Christ I believe will come true in these people that they would say do you see their love one for another do you you see how the husbands treats the wife the husband the brothers and the sisters get along they're friends and they love one another there must be a god there must be a Christ somewhere if they're acting like that and that is the prayer that Christ prayed and we are coming to that time and I want it so bad and Brethren will close and I hope it comes from my heart that I want that Unity with with everything that's in me I'm tired of fighting tired of defending myself tired of attacking I just want Jesus Christ and I want his people we came last night with the kids getting together saw all these different young people with different background just fellowshipping together and playing ball and enjoying each other can imagine how much it pleased the Lord how much it would please the Lord for us all to act out I'll close with this and turn the service to the Pastor Matthew chapter 22 ver 34 but when the Pharisees had heard that he had put the Sadducees to silence they were gathered together then one of them which was a lawyer asked him a question tempting them and saying he's trying to set up Jesus here with a question so they could get him on some sort of a doctrinal different Master which is greater which is the great commandment in the law Jesus said unto him Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart and with all thy soul with all thy mind this is the first and great command then Jesus adds and he says the second is like unto it Thou shalt love thy neighbor neighbor as thyself on these two Commandments hang all the law and the prophets so you say well brother Daniel that's a simple message all the prophets messages all the prophecies all that they said hang on these two things love your father love your brother so was Jesus simple Jesus was the word manifested himself and he brought this message that you love one another that you go forward in the unity of the Gospel everything friends that we should be is love beloved disciple all the disciples they preached love especially John he said love one another he says little children love one another and that's what we should be doing you love you all I'm grateful friends I'm grateful for friends I'm grateful that when I when I come in I see the young people and they came to greet me brother Diego feels so good you just feel that love and that's the greatest message that we could ever preach to any if we greet each other in love and we love one another and we lift each other up the Bible says that those of us which are strong should bear the in Bear the infirmities of those that are weak for one another love one another the enemy comes in and he steals our love he steals the unity of the Gospel brothers and sisters God bless you so when the anger Rises up when you get offended remember that this Unity starts right here and it can start here and it can spread you ever throw a rock you throw it out there and then the makes a Big Splash in the middle and the ripples just go out from that middle it could be from one person in this church that that's starts and that unity and that love spreads and I pray that I'm part of it as it happen and I pray that his it is already started God bless you let's all stand together I love you
