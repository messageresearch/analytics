Lord Jes we love you Lord we're here to honor you and Lord we thank you for all these things in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ you can be seated thank you um I uh I want to introduce myself to some of you may not may not know who I am my name is Tim Garcia Jr Tim gcia J if you were here this morning uh you heard my dad it was Tim Garcia Senor Pap Garcia if if you are an OG in this message you might know my grandpa his name is Paul Garcia Jr and uh and uh he he would that's the Legacy my family Left Behind for me and so I'm I'm grateful blessed uh it's a burden to carry his name but it's a it's a beautiful wonderful thing I am uh I'm from Cedar Hills Church of the Cross Phoenix campus Phoenix Cedar Hills Church of the CR I've been wanting to say that to you guys for like two years but I'm happy I get to say that I've been telling my mom one time I was like put it on the shirt let's wear it to Camp let's do it work out that way but but uh I I we are part of you like my dad said this is our our home base and and we are an Annex at in Phoenix so I'm happy to be here with you um thank you brother brother Caleb for inviting me over I I was telling brother Caleb I was telling my dad I almost didn't make it uh we had some things going on uh yesterday I I work at a at a public school for those of you who don't know I'm just going to throw you some flowers my wife is a championship level basketball coach so yesterday we had a we had a championship tournament and then tomorrow we have some important things going on at work as well so I didn't think I was going to be able to come matter of fact I told Brother Caleb I like any weekend but the 17th I can't make it that week and then and then something happened you're going to probably think I'm kind of of like a zealot or maybe you're going to think I'm crazy maybe you're going to think I really doesn't I really don't care what you think but but I'm GNA tell you but I'm gonna tell you I Heard a Voice and and the voice was was literally was Audible and you say whatever you want I know I know what happened it was an angel speaking to me and it pricked my heart and The Voice told me if you're called you better go and I I try to rationalize it in my head I was like look I want to go I do I I I said I would anytime happen I said I said look here's what I told I told Brother Cale I said it's one thing to find the time it's quite another thing to make the time like so I'll make the time but just not that day um and so I kind of rationalized it like that and then that same voice spoke again and it said woe unto you if you're called and you don't go so how do you how do you ignore that you don't you you buckle up and you become obedient and you do whatever it takes and so and so after I made the commitment sorry I'm just going to warm up here a little bit with you if you don't mind after we made the commitment a couple things happened I got sick and let me tell you working in a public school I I work in a Cess pool of disease and if there was ever like a Superman immune system that's mine so I got covid a lot of us you know struggled with that but but the the basic the colds the flu lose all that that doesn't happen I was about to knock on wood but it's not thanks to the wood it's thanks to the Lord right so so thanks to the Lord I just don't get sick like that and and then when I got sick I lost my voice and then I went to work and there was something happened I had to suspend 14 kids in one day and then I checked the mail and I got a letter from the IRS from something like eight years ago I'm like what is all this going on why is all this happening right see uhhuh I caught you you dirty dog oh and uh and uh you know you know yeah it's funny um you know a lot of times like my dad said today sometimes when when the devil fights us we like to fight back and I'm like my dad in a couple little ways we we we're little guys so we're kind of we're kind of feisty and and and what I didn't know about myself that I'm learning about myself and learning about my dad is we're also kind of sensitive babies sorry Dad but we are man um and uh and but but anyway I don't know why I said that but all that to say in 1604 the king of England King James he commissioned the Bible to be translated James and part of what we used to fight back against the devil no doubt are the words that they that they the way they the vernacular the the the language that they used in 16004 and it's very formal you know sometimes I used to wonder like I would wonder like do these guys like who who spoke like this who wrote like this like did they go home and like did they talk to their wives like that they're like oh the fair damsel thou Who treest The Gardens of my love like nowadays that would be like right and then they would I was like wondering like would they say like oh that thou would prepare me a meal wrapped in a blanket of ma and now we're like right and so and so I I say all that to say like sometimes we fight back with the way they spoke in 1604 and sometimes we fight back back with the way we speak in 2023 and so when I got sick I remembered a voice that I heard speak to me I said shut [Applause] up not only did I say shut up no but I a lot of things like we speak about now like back up off me man do g g i could have said get thee behind me Satan but I'm like bro back up ain't nobody got time for [Applause] that it was funny because let me tell you real quick we we were out of town and uh when I got sick and uh and my whole family was there they were having a great time and I I got so sick I went back to the hotel and then a lot of this stuff started to kick in and I started and then I remembered the voice and so I was like you know what forget you I'm gonna get my happy up no matter what I feel like I'm going go enjoy this time with my family so so here's what happens I you call me a zealot I don't care he told me to do it I'm going to do it so here's what I did I'm walking down street looking for my family and as soon as I start to feel sick shut up out loud like that I'm walking I'm walking by myself trying to keep my countenance from from like walking like shut up and there's people around lots of people like come here let the man pass don't make I contact because I just I'm just walking by myself I'm talking I'm like shut up back up and they're like he talking to so anyway that that's how I ended up here and and I I want to I want to share something with you today that no doubt you've heard over and over and over over and over and over again and so so what so what I want to share with you is nothing that nothing you're not going to say oh I never heard that before because because the fact is that there's nothing new that we could say and if I if I did try to say something new I no doubt would say it wrong and on that note I do want to preface everything that I say that if I say something contrary if I say something wrong to what your pastor Ministry has taught you you just tell me to shut up you put me to the side I don't want to be wrong I don't want to I don't want to be contradictory no doubt as human beings sometimes we say things wrong I make mistake you forgive me pray for me correct me and I I'm happy to learn Matthew 17 says blessed are you Simon barjon for flesh and blood has not revealed it to you but my Father which is in heaven and I say unto thee that thou are Peter and Upon This Rock I will build my church and the Gates of Hell shall not Prevail against it so theas reason why I'm telling you this is because although you've learned this before no doubt I am not expecting that I'm going to teach you something new today but rather hoping today will be the day that maybe for somebody the light bulb but we have to have a couple Baseline understandings first of all we have to all acknowledge that the Bible the word of God is our absolute I'm a teacher like I told you before so we're going to have a little bit of interaction especially with you people in the first three rows the B if the word of God is your absolute give me thumbs up please THS up if you don't have your thumbs up Bible is not your absolute that's okay just ignore everything that I say for the next however long I'm the if the Bible is your absolute then then we all acknowledge and agree that Jesus Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever okay because we're going to put some basic things together but without those two basic foundational things then nothing I'm going to say to you is g to make any sense because the reality is that I or your pastor or the ministry here if we could we would take an idea we take a thought we would take a revelation and we'd plant it in your brains and allow it to have fruit but the law of God in Matthew 16 says that there's nothing that Flesh and Blood I cannot make you understand your intelligence your brain your flesh and blood cannot make you understand some day the Lord is going to decide that today is going to be your Revelation day okay so so to give you an examp example because it's easy for us to learn with examples let's all go back to when we were 8 n 10 years old when we were learning multiplication and we were learning the standard algorithm for multiplication how many of you guys remember that everybody doesn't remember but that's okay so those of us who remember we remember that our teachers taught us no doubt I taught this we multiply one's Place times the one's place the ones times the tens the ones times the hundreds and then you put a zero at the bottom and then you do the T times the on and then 10 times the 10 and then 10 times 100 and then you put two zeros and then you keep going and then you and then you get to the end and then you have all these numbers at the bottom and then you add them and the kids are like add I thought we were multiplying why did I put these zeros there ain't no zeros in this number mister and we added the problems we added the numbers and the teacher asked you what' you get and you're like 14710 with the question at the end 14710 yeah and was like yes you got it good job and we like I got the answer right I don't I don't understand that's all right do it again we did the same thing blah blah blah blah blah put a zero now put two zeros now add them like okay and we're doing math like this because we really don't understand we're like okay okay and then I do it what' you get 848 yes you got it I got the answer right but I still don't understand and no doubt things like that happen in the spiritual right sometimes we do things and we might get things right but sometimes we really just don't understand well then one day you're doing the math you're doing math like this you still don't understand by the way this is like my eyebrows like pointing this way because I'm like confused so I don't understand and then one day you do the matth you're like oh I get it Mis Mis look it's because you do this and the reason why you do this is because of this give me another one give me another one oh I get it and you're like I've done been telling you that for the last two weeks but now you just got it why because because the law of God says that only the father can give Revelation matter what your teachers did only the only the Lord can give you Revelation it doesn't matter what your teachers do it doesn't matter how many times you do it it's in the Lord's time you're going to get the Revelation so I hope that maybe today oh somebody maybe somebody will understand okay so we just as as teachers as a teacher in the public education we just repeat repeat repeat repeat until the Lord decides to give you the Revelation so I'm going to ask you a couple questions and I'm going to ask for some participation I'm going to ask some of you to share out loud and I'm GNA ask some of you to stand and if you don't volunteer you will get volunt told I highly recommend man those of you especially if I know your name you say things out loud before you get called up and just like in school you had a good teacher not making eye contact is not going to be good enough call making eye contact because I know you're not trying to be all right um I told you guys that I Heard a Voice to me it was an angel speaking to me Supernatural and that's the title of our my thought today Supernatural so I'm going to ask you stand up if everybody doesn't have to stand up but if those of you in the front three rows you do need to stand up I'm GNA ask anyone who's willing able to stand up if you believe in Supernatural it would be hard to to to be a follower belever believer of this message if you didn't down so Supernatural is defined as a as a as a has a lot of definitions but but some of them are um things that are unexplainable by natural law pertaining to characterized by godliness by something of God pertaining to other unearthly beings in this case an Ang so I do have a question now for you I want to give you some time to think before you respond so I have a question here it is if you saw an angel with a Halo and wings glowing floating flying whatever you want to say what would you do put aside the fact that you probably faint pass out well I probably go to the dentist because I pass out and break my teeth that's not what I'm talking about in a perfect world if you could be prepared as prepared as you could be and you saw an angel what would you do somebody share out loud say something popcorn something what would you do hard to imagine but think about it put your head down in reverence I imagine you putting your head down what else pray what if that angel came with a Halo with wings floating and he spoke directly to you I have a message for Boaz now put your name in there for Boaz I have a message for fill in the blank with your name what would you do say again you would say speak your servant here is good and then you'd ask him yeah like tell me talk whatever you got to tell me tell me no doubt we wouldn't say well I don't have time because I got a I got a got a basketball game to go to so no doubt no doubt we would we would do that thank you what else would we do after that after we after we acknowledged doubt and reverence accepted that he was here to speak to us then what would we do ask questions you say you you have time to ask questions after the message what would you do while he's giving you his thoughts message what would you do check it with the word what else would we do we live in the 21st century boys and girls somebody falls on the side of the street I know what yall are doing so now tell me you see an angel what would you do record take a picture if you didn't have your phone what would you do take notes if you had a notebook what else would you do look around here there's I see we do we would look we would receive the message we would we would write it down we would record it oh my God and then what would we do with that we probably put it on Facebook trying to go viral with that Facebook I don't know viral you go Facebook on Facebook viral whatever you understand would would you would you share it okay if you feel like if an angel came spoke to me gave me a message that I would either record it write down my notes or some version of trying to encapsulate what he was telling me like you would do one of those things stand up you would either record or find the recording try to memorize everything that this angel said to me stand up good yeah I I find it I'm just gonna say I do find it hard to believe that if an angel showed up right here that we wouldn't do everything within our power to find evidence that that angel was actually there we don't have it up but don't we don't we in message churches put up every evidence that we have that picture of brother Brandman the Halo don't we take that picture everywhere in our Liv that that picture right there isn't that in every church because are we or are we not looking for evidence of the supernatural to if I had the wherewithal and I saw an angel speaking I would want to record it why because if he's given a message to me I want to is that true so I'm going to give you all an opportunity again it's kind of a loaded question but if you would do something like that to encapture what this Angel has spoken to you then then please stand up okay you see your your young people are standing every single one of them is standing they all took a little bit of coaxing but they did it yeah okay all right um can we open up our Bibles please we're going to read uh 1 Samuel 3:4 I read the scripture to you once before and I I love uh uncle uncle L back there I love his trombone baritone Voice last time I read the scri with with a different purpose but the scripture is compound so we're going toh share a different message that we're going to learn from this scripture hopefully 1 Samuel 3:4 says and the Lord called Samuel and he answered answered here am I all right all right somebody the first three R who was speaking it literally explicitly says in there and the Lord called Samuel so who was speaking Lord say it again who was speaking one more time who was speaking the Lord was speaking so if you're taking notes right there in your notes if you have a notebook write in your notebook 1st Samuel 3:4 the Lord is speaking and then if you're taking notes and you have lined paper skip a line because we're going to come back to that and then we're going to go to our next scripture it's I am not even giving you any time brother I'm just running through you're awesome thank you sorry about that Hebrews 37 give you some time to cut there I'm going to start reading it says wherefore as the Holy Ghost saith today if you will hear his voice Harden not your hearts as in the provocation in the day of Temptation in the wilderness when your fathers tempted me proved me and saw my works all right same question who is speaking what does it say Hebrews 37 what does it say who sayith say louder please the Holy Ghost so right there right next to that scripture not in you don't have to write in your Bibles but in your notes please write down the Holy Ghost is speaking so in the 1st Samuel 3:4 who is speaking in the Hebrew scripture who speaking now we are a message believing church I don't have to prove to you that the Holy Ghost and the Lord are one and the same Amen to that okay good so now so now here is the uh look the the burden of proof when when a minister comes up is is here right if we can show you here we can show you in the message I I dare to ask how many examples do we need to give for something to click but I'm gonna give you two examples so follow with me so Hebrews 3:79 it says wherefore as the Holy Ghost saith today if you will hear his voice Harden not your hearts as in the provocation in the day of Temptation in the wilderness when your fathers tempted me Pro me saw my Works who is speaking the Holy Ghost thank you now let me ask ask you the question of the Dayal question ask again before I do who is speaking the Holy Ghost is speaking what did his holy ghost voice sound like that's the essential question we can see that it says the Holy Ghost says I know who is speaking what did the voice sound like if you want to answer to that one let's turn to Psalms 957 Psalms 95 7-1 says for he is our God and we are the people of his pasture and the Sheep of his hand today if you will hear his voice Harden not your hearts as in the the provocation as in the day of Temptation in the wilderness when your fathers tempted me and saw my work remind me again who said that the Holy Ghost right remember Hebrews who said that it was a quote Paul was quoting he was quoting the Holy Ghost my question to you now people what did the voice sound like it sounded like David who wrote the Psalms who wrote them David so so the Holy Ghost spoke but what did the voice sound like who it sounded like David what was David he was a king he was a prophet he was a man who who was speaking David excuse me who was speaking the holy ghost that you cannot you cannot mess that up like I just did you cannot messed that up who was speaking the Holy Ghost what did the voice sound like sounded like David is that in the Bible or not is the Bible the absolute is the Bible the Supreme Authority in our life so the Holy Ghost spoke and it sounded like David good write that down now the voice sounded like David Hebrew scripture where I told you to skip a line now we're going to go back to Samuel because you know why we think about David and and I asked my son one time I asked that son who's David he said that he's a character from the Bible and no doubt many of us would probably answer like that he's a character from The Bible Goliath he was a king he did all these amazing things but you know it's crazy because if we were to read the biography of Martin Luther King Jr Martin Martin Luther King I would ask you who's ketta Scott King I would ask you who is ketta Scott King ketta Scott King how many of us would say she's a character from the story of Martin Luther King Luther King we wouldn't say she was a woman she was married to Martin Luther King Lu if this is real life we take that character in The Bible vernacular from our from our language David was a prophet David was a King David was a man and sorry to tell you what the Holy Ghost spoke through that man okay so so to me it's a lot easier to see the connection with with this with the Samuel verse so we're going to come back to that when now let's go back to 1st Samuel 3:4 and it said the Lord called Samuel and he answered here am I and he ran unto Eli and he said here I am you called me so let me ask you a question who was speaking don't don't say Samuel wasn't Samuel speaking who was speaking the Lord was speaking this say the Lord called the Lord who was speaking say it again loud who was speaking boys and girls what did the voice sound like it sounded like Eli and who was Eli wo who was he he was the high priest and you want to bring it home he was Samuel's Pastor who was he he was Samuel's Pastor is Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever or not how many of you know what 1+ 1 is 1+ 1 equals 2 and you have the revelation and no doubt if I try to tell you 1 plus one makes 11 you wouldn't take that you couldn't you would not accept that because you know because you have the Revelation get the revelation of this today boys and girls because the voice of the Lord to me because I have the Revelation to me sounds like our [Applause] pastor 1956 June 17th Revelation book of symbols paragraph 58 Prophet said when he stands here on the platform ministering the word of God he is God's angel to the church now we have problems and we say Lord Show Me A Sign Lord Send Me an Angel to speak to me in 2023 the Lord said I sent you a whole angel already I didn't send him your way but we would rather hear uh we would rather hear an angel with wings in the Halo I'm going to call you out now you're either going to eat your words or you're going to eat the word today because I had to I had to coax you but you all stood up you all stood up I did not make you stand up now we would rather hear an angel with wings than a Halo and we what did we say we said we would take it we would share it we would show it we would read it we' we we'd go over and over and over we'd take it in 197 October the six questions and answers which has the greatest Authority an angel from heaven or an angel at the pulpit which has it somebody guess brother brandham answered it somebody guess go ahead the angel at the pulit sorry to say but when you're Pastor not just the pastor brother brandham says if you are spirit-led by God you become a messenger of God angel God's messenger outside inside of you is physical but the inside of you is Supernatural and God sent you Supernatural gifts he sent you a pastor but he sent you an Apostles and evangelists and pastors and teachers these are gifts from God for you for your edification for your perfection and I promise you once you can capture this Vision capture that Revelation you can never ever again be the same and let me let me tell you when the pastor speaks when brother Tim speaks to me when Uncle L speaks to me when the ministry comes up in here and speaks to me I don't see Uncle Caleb I don't see Uncle I don't see Uncle l I'm sorry but I'm it the voice that spoke to me it said woe unto you if you don't go it was his voice right there raising his hand God told me wo unto you if you don't go so here I am because full obedience the word of God entitles you to the Tok and that's the sign of full obedience Revelations 1:3 says apyp blessed is he forget that change it blessed is Tim Garcia j blessed is Tim Garcia j he reads and he hears the words of the prophecy he keeps the things that are written there in what does that mean to me it says blessed is him that reads hears and obeys and you know what we come to we come to the ministry with issues and they give us we come to them because they're the Lord's Angels sent to us and I'm sorry go unto me if I go to him with a problem he tells me exactly the steps I need to take why because it's God's voice speaking it sounds like these men here understand something please that he might ask me or tell me to do something although I did not understand how I was going to be here today understanding is not a prerequisite for obedience it does not say that I am the author of Eternal salvation for all those who understand it says I am the author of Eternal salvation for all those that believe and if I believe this book I know Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever know that those voices although they sound like men that I know and respect when they are inspired of the Holy Ghost God's voice speaking I don't stand anything I don't I don't stand to gain anything by telling you this up here because I happen to have recently been ordained as a minister the fivefold ministry is sent for you and I don't attt to gain anything I just want to make it there and I want to make it there with you and you and you and all of you I want to all be together it Ministry to repeat and repeat and repeat until the light bulb goes on and we get it that we can understand that it's the Lord speaking brother Caleb with a cute message awesome how it tied together with what we heard on Wednesday vindicating and Vindicated word of God in 2023 and I hope I hope and I pray that this help somebody let's pray please dear Lord Heavenly Father Lord Jesus I love you so much I thank you Lord Jesus for your people here that gave me a little bit of time lord Jesus to share something Lord that I just I love Lord Jesus because you showed it to me Lord you sent me a man Lord Jesus and he took me to the side and he sat me down and he guided me Lord and you sent a Ministry Lord that helped me understand Lord and then you gave me Revelation my lord it's beautiful and my life can never be the same Lord Jesus would you do that for your people here we love you Lord we honor you we thank you and we we we bless you for blessing us Lord Jesus we we are so blessed and we thank you in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen thank you [Applause] man don't you
