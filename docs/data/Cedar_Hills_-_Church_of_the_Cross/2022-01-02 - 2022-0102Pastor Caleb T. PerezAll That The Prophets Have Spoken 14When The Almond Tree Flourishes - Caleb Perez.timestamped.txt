[6:07] part 3 video
[6:09] this morning so we hope you all enjoy
[6:12] god bless you
[6:29] and now the purpose of these lessons is
[6:31] to anchor those that have already come
[6:35] across the land
[6:38] the purpose of the studying this book of
[6:40] ephesians is to positionally place the
[6:44] church where it absolutely stands in
[6:48] christ
[6:50] we are cut out different we're made
[6:52] different we are nature different
[6:56] and we are positionally placed
[6:58] differently
[7:00] [Music]
[7:05] maybe one for just a little kind of a
[7:08] work another for a large work
[7:10] don't be scared of nothing
[7:20] [Music]
[7:28] one body which is christ and we are safe
[7:32] forever
[7:36] the question the question was asked
[7:37] yesterday by a theologian to me to me
[7:40] that's been canning the meetings you're
[7:42] hearing the tape
[8:28] [Music]
[8:37] because he's infinite
[8:43] [Music]
[9:18] [Music]
[9:20] [Applause]
[9:32] amen
[9:34] then
[9:34] adoption placing placing oh god how
[9:38] god's doing this on the word
[9:40] and now if i can god might be again
[9:42] i'm going to start right now the fifth
[9:44] verse i want to read it having three
[9:46] having predestinated us unto the
[9:48] adoption of children by jesus christ
[9:51] to himself according to his own good
[9:53] pleasure good pleasure of his will
[9:57] it's god's pleasure to do his will
[10:01] adopt adopting place placing
[10:05] now now
[10:06] what's he doing placing him replacing
[10:08] his church
[10:10] and thank you god gave his children a
[10:12] new birthday baptism of the holy spirit
[10:28] that's what the scripture said
[10:30] what worries me
[10:32] is to take people and preach to them
[10:35] this god
[10:36] sent truth
[10:39] and they'll turn right back around and
[10:41] just keep on doing the same thing and
[10:43] say they got the holy ghost
[10:48] this nearly ruins you
[10:52] what's the matter
[10:54] they come right back to the same thing
[10:56] just like the children of israel they
[10:59] wanted a king
[11:00] so this king could rule over them and
[11:02] make them act like the amorites and the
[11:05] amalekites
[11:06] and the philistines
[11:09] we should be so on fire for god we
[11:12] should be going day to night
[11:14] nothing should be able to stop us
[11:17] and we should be so sweet and so
[11:19] pleasant
[11:20] and so kind and so christ-like in our
[11:22] lives
[11:24] it takes every day's life
[11:27] how long is this salvation lasting
[11:29] how long what kind of salvation is it
[11:31] from church to church from
[11:33] let's turn to hebrews 9 11 just a minute
[11:36] just to look and see how long this for a
[11:37] few minutes
[11:39] turn over to look at hebrews
[11:41] let's let's find out how long this
[11:44] salvation is lasting
[11:47] see what kind of salvation is
[11:52] let's read now hebrews 9 11
[11:54] but christ becoming a higher priest of
[11:57] good things to come
[11:58] by a greater and more perfect tabernacle
[12:01] not made with hands that is to say this
[12:04] is the same teacher paul
[12:07] leather
[12:08] of this building neither by the blood of
[12:10] goats or calves
[12:12] but by his own blood
[12:15] he has entered
[12:16] in
[12:17] once how many times
[12:20] once unto the holy place having obtained
[12:24] salvation for a week
[12:28] salvation to the next revival
[12:31] what kind
[12:32] each channel redemption for us
[12:39] what's the word eternal mean
[12:44] eat christ
[12:45] [Music]
[12:46] after i have believed
[12:49] no man can call jesus christ only by the
[12:51] holy ghost
[12:52] there's all these three classes of
[12:54] people unbelievers make believers and
[12:56] believers
[12:59] but them wants to have believed unto
[13:02] eternal life

[13:06] tabernacle what's the first thing you do
[13:09] enter into the course of the jackal
[13:11] next was the brazing order where to wash
[13:13] the sacrifice at the golden lava the
[13:15] next was the killing of the sacrifice
[13:17] and the sprinkling of the blood upon the
[13:19] altar
[13:20] then once the year
[13:25] anointed
[13:29] with what with the rose of sharon
[13:31] perfume
[13:33] with precious oil in the head for a few
[13:35] minutes they poured it on his head and
[13:36] went plumb down to the hymns of his
[13:38] skirts

[13:42] when they
[13:43] took out a blood of the covenant

[47:03] amen with the subtitle when the almond
[47:05] tree
[47:07] flourishes
[47:09] [Music]
[47:30] just turn around and
[47:32] make your neighbor comfortable
[47:37] good to see you neighbor good to see
[47:39] what you got
[47:54] that's something on my glasses and i
[47:56] can't see
[48:00] amen
[48:02] let's turn in our scriptures if you
[48:03] would
[48:04] well to the book of ecclesiastes the
[48:08] 12th chapter and the fifth verse
[48:14] we want to pray that we can finish this
[48:16] this morning
[48:24] [Music]
[48:25] amen
[48:27] says also when they shall be afraid of
[48:30] that which is high
[48:32] and fears shall be in the way
[48:34] and the almond tree shall flourish
[48:37] and the grasshopper shall be a burden
[48:40] and desire shall fail
[48:42] because man goeth to his long home
[48:45] and the mourners go about the
[49:11] amen
[49:12] we can turn to one more scripture
[49:16] and it's found in luke the 21st chapter
[49:19] lucas
[49:21] and the 29th and 30th verse
[49:26] you can say man
[49:51] and it says like it says or reads like
[49:53] this he spake unto them a parable
[49:56] behold the fig tree
[49:59] and all the trees
[50:04] who is the fig tree
[50:09] sure
[50:14] that's what i hear
[50:16] who's the fig tree
[50:18] okay
[50:20] who are all the other trees
[50:35] there's a lot to all the other trees
[50:40] watch verse 30. this is very important
[50:44] when
[50:45] they
[50:48] not it
[50:53] there is more than one
[50:57] when they now
[50:59] shoot forth
[51:03] and know of your own selves
[51:06] that summer
[51:07] is now
[51:08] nigh at hand
[51:13] may god add his blessings to the reading
[51:15] of his word and you may be seated
[51:19] once again the fig tree is israel
[51:24] and all the other trees are all the
[51:26] other nations
[51:29] as we see this and it says when they now
[51:32] shoot forth
[51:34] the word
[51:47] it's to push to the front
[51:51] but the work but the definition that we
[51:53] want to use today
[51:55] is shoot
[51:56] meaning
[51:58] to germinate
[52:01] once again now take that when we read it
[52:03] again when they now
[52:06] germinate
[52:10] then you know
[52:11] of your own selves
[52:15] now now very very we we've got to get
[52:17] this down this morning
[52:21] once again it doesn't say that when the
[52:23] fig tree shoots forth
[52:27] it says when they now shoot forth
[52:33] matthew 24 32 one more scripture and
[52:36] then we'll get into the message
[52:42] when you have it you can say amen
[52:45] i don't know i'm just asking because i'm
[52:46] very hot up here right now
[52:49] i was hoping somebody would agree with
[52:51] me
[52:53] turn on the fans a little bit but you
[52:55] too cold
[52:56] no so will the fans be okay
[53:01] you get cold just
[53:04] well
[53:06] raise your hand or something
[53:09] we'll just turn it off in honor
[53:13] matthew 24 32 says now learn a parable
[53:17] of the fig tree delegate
[53:20] when his branch is yet tender
[53:24] and put his forth leaves you know that
[53:27] summer is nigh
[53:31] now listen he said the generation that
[53:34] seen the fig tree putting forth its buds
[53:40] watch he said the fig tree and all the
[53:44] other trees
[53:46] in other words there would be a
[53:48] universal revival at that time
[53:54] and then he says now watch this prophecy
[53:58] how it works in como trabaja and just
[54:01] blends in perfect
[54:05] all the other trees putting forth their
[54:08] buds
[54:22] as brother branham makes this prayer
[54:26] in the message everlasting life and how
[54:28] to receive it
[54:33] how he explains this budding that's
[54:35] going on
[54:48] amen
[54:50] that old six
[54:51] start of david is waving over jerusalem
[54:54] tonight
[55:00] orlando for the first time in 2500 years
[55:17] that's good and bad trees
[55:20] they're all putting forth their buds
[55:24] the wicked ones are
[55:26] putting forth their buds
[55:30] romanism
[55:31] is putting forth its budget
[55:35] communism
[55:37] is putting forth its bugs
[55:40] and then he says
[55:41] and lord he's talking to the lord now
[55:46] your church is putting forth its buds
[55:50] watch as we see this unfold
[55:53] it is the fig tree and all the trees
[55:58] that are all putting forth its buds
[56:02] he says springtime is coming
[56:06] that's resurrection time right
[56:08] spring time is coming
[56:11] oh great master of life oh grand maestro
[56:14] de la
[56:25] to stretch forth the hand of thy holy
[56:28] child jesus
[56:57] he said when you see the fig tree
[57:00] putting forth its buds
[57:03] and all the other trees
[57:06] know that the time is nigh even at the
[57:09] doors
[57:38] that's where i want to start my message
[57:40] today
[57:42] they see the fig tree
[57:45] they see the other trees
[57:48] they don't have the spiritual
[57:50] application of the words
[58:20] israel
[58:22] parallels the spiritual church
[58:26] now watch i'm going to say it again
[58:28] brother branham is saying this
[58:30] he said they they understand natural
[58:32] israel
[58:34] they don't
[58:46] as we heard on friday
[58:58] i think we should all be awake this
[58:59] morning right
[59:01] it's a new year it's an awakening that's
[59:05] that is happening
[59:12] notice they recognize israel as a nation
[59:16] they recognize the fig tree putting
[59:18] forth its buds
[59:21] but they have not recognized some of the
[59:23] other trees
[59:25] that are also putting forth their buds
[59:29] it comes this is the message i
[59:56] and you must bring it through
[59:58] the time
[1:00:01] now watch once again the fig tree is
[1:00:04] budding
[1:00:05] when you see the fig tree budding
[1:00:08] all the other trees
[1:00:11] okay
[1:00:11] watch what he's saying here now because
[1:00:13] every tree
[1:00:15] you must bring it through time
[1:00:19] through the bible
[1:00:22] every tree now
[1:00:24] now i i i'm gonna stop here because i
[1:00:26] want you to to get this
[1:00:29] captain
[1:00:30] who is the fig tree
[1:00:32] again
[1:00:34] we want to learn this morning
[1:00:37] victory is who
[1:00:39] again now your neighbor because it's
[1:00:40] good to repeat things
[1:00:43] the fig tree is israel
[1:00:46] okay
[1:00:48] the next question is
[1:00:51] then who is the olive tree entosis
[1:00:58] i want to build you uh i want to paint
[1:00:59] you a picture this morning
[1:01:01] who is the olive tree now
[1:01:07] i ain't getting hurt this morning
[1:01:09] journal with the princess
[1:01:51] scriptures according we got to follow it
[1:01:53] through the scriptures now
[1:01:55] you got to take it through time
[1:02:00] take it through the bible
[1:02:02] find out who these trees are
[1:02:18] who israel
[1:02:29] but it is israel's salvation
[1:02:47] once again we we see that we have the
[1:02:50] fig tree israel as a nation
[1:02:54] we have the olive tree israel
[1:03:00] if you want to know that romans 11 is is
[1:03:02] the olive tree romano
[1:03:05] and you and i are the wild olive
[1:03:08] branches
[1:03:14] we come
[1:03:26] under the salvation party
[1:03:33] now watch this now the fig tree
[1:03:36] matthew 21.
[1:03:39] watch as we understand this
[1:03:42] under the olive
[1:03:55] god gave israel the privilege of being a
[1:03:58] nation in his sight
[1:04:02] and the vine is israel's spiritual state
[1:04:07] isaiah 5 7.
[1:04:10] for the vineyard of the lord of hosts is
[1:04:12] the house of israel
[1:04:18] if you lose track of of what how he's
[1:04:21] dealing with israel
[1:04:44] we then see that the lord as he began to
[1:04:47] deal with me about the almond tree
[1:04:51] first thing we do we look up all the
[1:04:53] scriptures about almonds
[1:04:59] there was a few not not very many no
[1:05:03] i knew that if maybe some of you may
[1:05:05] remember
[1:05:16] but there was something more that the
[1:05:17] lord wanted to is wanting us to know
[1:05:22] and that's why when when i read this
[1:05:24] scripture
[1:05:26] jesus is telling them
[1:05:29] behold
[1:05:30] in other words
[1:05:31] take notice
[1:05:34] you've got to make
[1:05:43] all right watch us now when they shoot
[1:05:45] forth or when they begin to germinate
[1:06:02] good things bad things
[1:06:05] it seems like everybody's getting
[1:06:06] traction
[1:06:08] everybody's ideas
[1:06:11] everybody's ideas right
[1:06:14] here's another group that just raises up
[1:06:31] oh my that's why it's so so appealing to
[1:06:34] so many people
[1:06:37] because it's not just a dead tree
[1:06:39] anymore
[1:06:41] how they're able to eat off these trees
[1:06:44] watch watch as it starts to bud it
[1:06:46] starts to bloom
[1:06:49] so when i see this
[1:06:52] i know that in israel
[1:06:54] that the almond tree is the first tree
[1:06:57] to blossom
[1:07:11] so why is this important brother is
[1:07:14] important once again the almond tree is
[1:07:17] the first tree to blossom
[1:07:21] with that in mind
[1:07:23] i want to pick up where i left off on
[1:07:25] friday
[1:07:31] the more i read this the more it blew my
[1:07:33] mind
[1:07:36] moreover the word of the lord came unto
[1:07:38] me saying jeremiah
[1:07:47] and i said this is jeremiah speaking
[1:07:51] i see
[1:07:52] a rod of an alban tree the unavara
[1:07:56] wait a minute i i gotta stop there for a
[1:07:58] moment
[1:08:00] because i know israel is the olive tree
[1:08:03] is the fig tree
[1:08:07] the vineyard
[1:08:08] i know
[1:08:12] that the almond tree is there's
[1:08:14] something special about it
[1:08:17] so here he says i see a rod of an almond
[1:08:20] tree
[1:08:23] the word rod
[1:08:25] la palabra
[1:08:26] also means to germinate
[1:08:30] so
[1:08:32] it means germinate is to
[1:08:34] grow or develop
[1:08:50] what are you seeing jeremiah
[1:08:53] he says i see the germinating of an
[1:08:55] almond tree
[1:08:59] i see it sprouting
[1:09:02] i see the creation
[1:09:04] i see an almond tree coming into
[1:09:07] existence
[1:09:09] and then the voice says
[1:09:11] the lord said unto me
[1:09:14] thou has well seen
[1:09:17] for i will hasten my word
[1:09:31] i'm going to produce that i'm going to
[1:09:32] perform that
[1:09:34] now listen closely
[1:09:36] jeremiah isn't is as he as he's speaking
[1:09:39] here
[1:09:41] he's
[1:09:42] seeing just a shoe come forth
[1:09:46] or not just
[1:09:49] but he's watching as the lord is going
[1:09:50] to hasten to perform his word
[1:09:57] okay
[1:09:58] zechariah 4 1-7 1-7
[1:10:04] how many are following me so far
[1:10:08] we're clear so far right
[1:10:10] all right what do you see okay look at
[1:10:13] this i see
[1:10:14] the rod
[1:10:17] of an almond tree
[1:10:20] this this blows me away i'm telling you
[1:10:22] you'll understand in a minute
[1:10:28] so i asked the question on friday and
[1:10:30] i'll ask it again
[1:10:36] do you see
[1:10:37] natural israel
[1:10:40] you see spiritual church
[1:10:55] came again and wake me as a man that is
[1:10:57] waking out of his sleep
[1:10:59] welcome to verse 2
[1:11:00] and said unto me
[1:11:03] what she is though
[1:11:05] oh now he's asking zechariah
[1:11:08] what sees thou
[1:11:10] and i said i have looked
[1:11:13] and behold
[1:11:14] uh he's looking and beholding now right
[1:11:18] a candlestick all of gold
[1:11:23] with a bowl upon the top of it
[1:11:27] and his seven lamps thereon
[1:11:31] and seven pipes to the seven lamps
[1:11:36] which are upon the top thereof
[1:11:46] one upon the right side of the ball and
[1:11:48] other upon the left side
[1:11:52] so i answered and speak to the angel
[1:11:53] that talked with me and and now he has a
[1:11:56] question
[1:12:00] it was what are you seeing
[1:12:03] i see a candlestick
[1:12:06] but he doesn't know what it means
[1:12:08] so now he turns around and asks the
[1:12:10] angel
[1:12:13] what mean
[1:12:16] the the candlesticks
[1:12:19] and the two olive trees
[1:12:31] is the meaning of these
[1:12:48] spake unto me saying
[1:12:52] this is the word of the lord
[1:12:54] unto zerah babel
[1:12:56] saying not by might
[1:12:58] nor by power
[1:13:00] but by my spirit saith the lord of hosts
[1:13:32] i see the whole thing
[1:13:34] i see the candlesticks
[1:13:37] what is this i don't know what this is
[1:13:39] once again uh he says
[1:13:42] this is the word of the lord
[1:13:47] this is the word of the lord
[1:13:49] say not by might nor by power
[1:13:52] i am bringing it and no other way
[1:13:56] but by my spirit
[1:13:58] who art
[1:14:27] also established
[1:14:28] let's go to revelations 11 4.
[1:14:31] remember the question what are these
[1:14:38] revelations 11 4
[1:14:40] revelations
[1:14:46] what are these
[1:14:48] these
[1:14:49] are the two olive trees
[1:14:52] and the two candle sticks
[1:15:14] jeremiah sees a shoot or a rod of an
[1:15:17] almond tree
[1:15:19] zechariah is the candlestick and two
[1:15:21] olive trees
[1:15:37] oh here we go
[1:15:39] now now we must find
[1:15:41] what the connection is
[1:15:45] with the almond tree the almendro and
[1:15:48] the candlestick that's
[1:15:50] are you with me you want to go on this
[1:15:52] ride
[1:15:55] yeah okay
[1:15:56] let's find out let's see what the
[1:15:58] connection is
[1:16:01] look at these candlesticks
[1:16:04] what
[1:16:18] these candlesticks estos candeleros were
[1:16:21] olive branches
[1:16:24] that
[1:16:26] did mean
[1:16:29] i looked at this
[1:16:34] almond tree
[1:16:36] okay
[1:16:38] look look at this up here
[1:16:40] what's this though
[1:16:43] the question what do you see give me
[1:16:44] that ah seven candle sticks
[1:17:00] a tree
[1:17:05] what's the representation of it
[1:17:08] the symbol is showing us something else
[1:17:11] catch the symbol we miss the revelations
[1:17:42] or do you see a tree obviously
[1:17:45] ah good answer yeah that's right
[1:17:49] what see us now can meet us now
[1:17:52] this is this this just gets me mr brown
[1:17:55] says these candle sticks
[1:17:58] were olive branches
[1:18:01] would you agree with that and they are
[1:18:03] all the branches sunbrella
[1:18:05] that just threw my almond tree idea out
[1:18:08] the window huh
[1:18:13] so if they were olive branches
[1:18:16] that deals with salvation
[1:18:21] and if i look at that and do not see
[1:18:23] salvation the humidity
[1:18:37] if those are olive branches
[1:18:54] i gotta be honest with you i'm telling
[1:18:56] you how i got this message okay
[1:18:59] i said lord i don't get it
[1:19:01] i see an almond tree
[1:19:03] olive oil and then he asked me again
[1:19:22] right he's saying
[1:19:23] he's giving you props he said now we all
[1:19:25] know
[1:19:27] wow thank you
[1:19:28] yeah
[1:19:30] we all know
[1:19:31] that these candle sticks and so forth
[1:19:38] [Music]
[1:20:14] into the root of the tamed olive tree
[1:20:30] are we making some progress here
[1:20:33] look at this again what see us now
[1:20:38] both jewish and gentiles
[1:20:41] okay let's let's go a little bit more
[1:20:43] here
[1:20:44] and watch this now so am i just looking
[1:20:47] at an almond tree
[1:20:54] i see an almond tree i see an olive tree
[1:20:58] i see both
[1:21:12] now i got a headache
[1:21:14] now i got to get up out of my office and
[1:21:16] go and say huh
[1:21:18] yeah
[1:21:18] i'm not kidding
[1:21:25] and then the light bulb goes off
[1:21:33] i see a tree of life
[1:21:37] oh my now it's starting to make sense
[1:21:53] i see a tree where life is
[1:22:08] are you with me
[1:22:10] revelations 22.
[1:22:12] lord how can one tree produce more than
[1:22:15] one kind of fruit
[1:22:18] and he showed me a pure river of water
[1:22:21] of life
[1:22:41] [Applause]
[1:22:50] it bears 12 manner of fruit
[1:22:55] and yielded her fruit every month
[1:22:58] and the leaves of the tree
[1:23:01] were for the healing of the nation
[1:23:04] watch
[1:23:12] an almond
[1:23:13] is it a nut
[1:23:19] oh
[1:23:21] i gotta go check all these things
[1:23:24] in my mind almonds are nuts
[1:23:27] you guys know how much i love almonds
[1:23:32] and when you search it out
[1:23:34] almonds are not nuts
[1:23:37] almonds are fruit
[1:23:41] we'll get into that in a moment
[1:23:44] so it makes sense then
[1:23:46] gotta make sure
[1:23:55] exodus 25 31-36
[1:24:15] he's trying to mold this thing
[1:24:19] god is
[1:24:21] that it showed him
[1:24:22] but it was
[1:24:24] shall make a candle stick of pure gold
[1:24:27] yeah
[1:24:52] his shaft and his branches his bowls his
[1:24:54] knobs and his flowers
[1:24:56] shall be the same
[1:24:57] place
[1:25:02] six branches shall come out of the sides
[1:25:05] of it
[1:25:07] how many branches are on this right that
[1:25:09] you see
[1:25:22] i gotta say that again because that's
[1:25:24] not didn't come out right
[1:25:27] it is not just
[1:25:28] a branch
[1:25:31] i got to correct the holy spirit
[1:25:32] corrects me when i'm there it's not just
[1:25:34] a branch
[1:25:37] come out of the main branches
[1:25:41] how many of you know what the middle one
[1:25:43] is
[1:25:45] it's called the servant branch
[1:25:50] it feeds the other six
[1:25:55] watch that now he's he's gotta make this
[1:25:57] and and there's six branches shall come
[1:25:59] out of the sides three on each side
[1:26:04] three balls made like onto almonds
[1:26:10] that's why we see an almond tree
[1:26:13] the bowls were made like onto almonds
[1:26:18] with a knob and a flower in one branch
[1:26:22] three bowls were made like almonds on
[1:26:24] the other branch
[1:26:28] and a flower
[1:26:29] flower and the six branches that come
[1:26:31] out of the candles
[1:26:34] and in the candlesticks shall be four
[1:26:36] bowls made like unto almonds
[1:26:40] with their knobs and flowers
[1:26:44] you can keep on reading if you want
[1:26:47] but it was made out of one it shall be
[1:26:50] one beaten work of pure gold
[1:26:56] in studying jewish culture
[1:27:01] when god instructed moses to make the
[1:27:03] menorah
[1:27:08] moses lamented
[1:27:11] because the dimensions
[1:27:14] details
[1:27:15] and curves of the candlestick
[1:27:30] and instructed
[1:28:14] watch this is so so tremendous
[1:28:17] the seven golden lamps stands
[1:28:20] for candlesticks or lampstands
[1:28:23] was formed by god
[1:28:25] himself foreign
[1:28:30] it was the seven spirits of god that
[1:28:32] were used
[1:28:33] to produce a bride so foreign
[1:28:44] this one is not an exact of what it
[1:28:47] really is
[1:28:50] but if you take the knop
[1:28:52] the flower
[1:28:54] oh the
[1:29:09] has
[1:29:10] three sets
[1:29:17] three
[1:29:18] times on each side three is what
[1:29:22] anybody good in math
[1:29:25] nine so there's there's should be nine
[1:29:28] flowers cups and knobs
[1:29:42] which means that there are
[1:29:44] nine spiritual gifts
[1:29:49] nine fruits of the spirit fruit
[1:29:54] when you take these things now six
[1:29:56] branches
[1:30:01] in the middle one there is four and then
[1:30:05] okay there's not just three there's four
[1:30:06] in the middle
[1:30:09] wasn't there a fourth man in the fire
[1:30:13] make sure we get that
[1:30:16] so
[1:30:16] six branches with three each that's
[1:30:18] eighteen
[1:30:31] abraham to take thy son and sacrifice
[1:30:37] you take the number then on the
[1:30:39] on one side
[1:30:45] and so there's nine
[1:30:47] i know every nine sets times three
[1:30:51] is how many
[1:30:53] twenty-seven right
[1:30:54] that's the total number of books in the
[1:30:57] new testament
[1:30:59] if you take the on the other side
[1:31:01] there's 27 too
[1:31:03] but you count the middle
[1:31:05] right
[1:31:07] then there is what
[1:31:10] but there's four there's four sets
[1:31:15] there's three in each one
[1:31:28] we have any school teachers here
[1:31:31] i need help
[1:31:36] if there's four
[1:31:38] times three
[1:31:39] the set is three
[1:31:40] quarters
[1:32:37] her attributes are his own glorious
[1:32:39] attributes
[1:32:42] her identity is found in him
[1:32:45] but he is she is to reflect
[1:32:49] what he has she is to manifest
[1:33:20] the eternal
[1:33:34] by faith
[1:33:38] but not only is the candlestick of gold
[1:33:42] it is of beaten gold
[1:33:45] hand crafted of beaten gold formaldehyde
[1:33:49] listen closely now
[1:33:50] according to her blueprints
[1:33:56] which were spirit given
[1:34:00] what she is dead
[1:34:04] come on church i want to i want you to
[1:34:05] go a little step farther now
[1:34:11] different kinds
[1:34:12] of classes but now i want to go a step
[1:34:14] further
[1:34:15] tomorrow
[1:34:58] well it all happened up where the angels
[1:35:00] of the lord appeared to me one morning
[1:35:05] and them squirrels was spoken into
[1:35:07] existence
[1:35:10] oh if you see the third pool in action
[1:35:12] here
[1:35:26] going hunting
[1:35:38] and there stood the seven golden
[1:35:40] candlesticks
[1:35:54] because they don't have the spiritual
[1:35:56] application
[1:36:01] they were that candlesticks was standing
[1:36:03] there on top of the hill
[1:36:07] with like a rainbow coming through the
[1:36:09] pipes
[1:36:12] and immediately after that
[1:36:15] the lord jesus appeared to us
[1:36:18] and i heard a voice that said
[1:36:21] jehovah of the old
[1:37:03] and in that day you will know
[1:37:18] it is the tree of life
[1:37:20] [Applause]
[1:37:45] does the engraving of the almonds on the
[1:37:48] candlestick represent
[1:37:53] what's with all the almonds and the
[1:37:55] flowers and all this
[1:37:59] is with me
[1:38:55] the cycle of the almond tree
[1:39:10] this
[1:39:24] and all the other trees
[1:39:30] summer's coming
[1:39:33] so the first thing it pre it receives a
[1:39:35] command
[1:39:37] to blossom
[1:40:32] itself in light pink blossoms
[1:40:54] the bees and other insects began to
[1:40:56] deliver pollen to the blossoms
[1:41:03] the first fruit then begins to emerge
[1:41:06] from the calyx
[1:41:09] and it resembles a flame of fire
[1:41:15] they will grow to their maximum size
[1:41:18] over a course of seven to eight weeks
[1:41:24] when
[1:41:25] does this tree begin to blossom
[1:41:29] it's the first street to blossom in
[1:41:30] israel
[1:41:33] usually around the end of january
[1:41:38] there's there's something here now
[1:41:41] at this time
[1:41:42] the first fruit may be hand-picked
[1:41:54] and the summer heat
[1:41:56] is what splits it opens
[1:42:13] there's so many things here
[1:42:15] and when it does it when the last day
[1:42:17] the seed inside is then revealed
[1:42:21] how tremendous that is
[1:42:24] and until you come behind the badger
[1:42:52] jesus christ is the same yesterday today
[1:42:54] and forever
[1:43:09] that's his word made manifest
[1:43:13] afterwards the trees are shaken
[1:43:18] for them to fall to the ground
[1:43:21] they're beaten
[1:43:36] when i see this i say wow
[1:43:40] this is it's something that's so
[1:43:41] tremendous
[1:43:43] because
[1:43:44] watch
[1:43:46] this almond tree now

[1:43:57] across watch this now
[1:43:58] no no no notice this now take this day
[1:44:01] when we see this
[1:44:03] and we see how all this unfolds
[1:44:08] no wonder jeremiah saw an almond
[1:44:13] he was looking at a branch
[1:44:16] one branch
[1:44:17] and because it was carved out with
[1:44:19] almonds on it
[1:44:25] i see the the rod of an almond tree
[1:44:30] he wasn't wrong
[1:44:36] watch this now this is so so good to me

[1:44:41] but i mean
[1:44:42] we're in sunday school let's let's let's
[1:44:44] learn a little bit here that is
[1:45:00] mm-hmm watch there's where they put
[1:45:04] aaron's rod
[1:45:07] not in the outer courts
[1:45:09] they put it in here on the inside
[1:45:12] for one purpose
[1:45:14] now here's aaron with his rod
[1:45:17] maybe brother carlos will preach this
[1:45:19] one day if not i'm going to have to get
[1:45:20] it
[1:45:21] give you a little opportunity to preach
[1:45:23] on is the rod of aaron and the rod of
[1:45:25] moses the same rod
[1:45:37] watch this now
[1:45:39] aaron's rod lavara de arron must have
[1:45:42] come from an almond tree
[1:45:49] here he comes with his rod
[1:45:53] now when air when moses had the rod
[1:46:52] what happened to the serpent
[1:46:54] they fossilize inside
[1:46:58] what happened to it
[1:47:00] the same thing that happens to the
[1:47:03] serpent
[1:47:05] that is in our hearts
[1:47:23] [Applause]
[1:48:15] did you know that it usually takes
[1:48:17] between five and 15 years for
[1:48:20] an almond tree to start producing
[1:48:25] and maybe some of us
[1:48:28] serving the lord for a long time
[1:49:13] come on now so don't give up no
[1:49:15] just know that right now
[1:49:17] if you go into the presence of god
[1:49:21] he'll make you start producing almonds
[1:49:26] you don't have to
[1:49:39] that has been poured into the
[1:50:06] even before he was even dealing with a
[1:50:09] gentiles
[1:50:12] even before he was dealing with the
[1:50:14] gentiles
[1:50:18] dealing with his people
[1:50:21] he already thought of you enough
[1:50:50] do you see
[1:50:51] an olive tree
[1:50:53] oh we're attached now
[1:50:57] but i also see an almond tree
[1:51:01] glory to god
[1:51:03] watch this now
[1:51:05] as we come around the corner
[1:51:09] it wasn't enough just to have the seven
[1:51:11] candlesticks
[1:51:15] if it was just for light what is
[1:51:32] the awakening
[1:51:36] you get that i'm going to say it again
[1:51:37] without the designs
[1:51:40] without the engraving
[1:51:42] there is
[1:51:44] no symbol for the awakening no is
[1:51:55] [Music]
[1:51:56] oh my
[1:51:57] no wonder god covered the candlesticks
[1:52:00] in almonds and blossoms
[1:52:05] learn a parable
[1:52:10] it's not just what you see
[1:52:12] but yet it's in the details
[1:53:01] watch this now almonds are members of
[1:53:03] the rose family
[1:53:06] and you know what the almonds are known
[1:53:07] as
[1:53:10] the queen
[1:53:27] the almond is used for making oil in the
[1:53:29] home and medicine
[1:53:34] did you know that when jacob
[1:53:37] jacobo had that dream du
[1:53:40] of angels ascending and descending los
[1:53:41] angeles
[1:53:43] there's a lot of arrows for you young
[1:53:45] for you ministers i came to translation
[1:53:47] did you know
[1:53:49] that when he had the dream of the angels
[1:53:51] ascending and he said
[1:54:01] the bible says he called it bethel which
[1:54:03] means
[1:54:04] the house of god
[1:54:34] oh
[1:54:45] oh every tree all the way through the
[1:54:47] bible
[1:55:02] full attention just for the next five
[1:55:05] ten minutes right
[1:55:08] when the almond tree flourishes
[1:55:13] once again ecclesiastes 12 5.
[1:55:16] he goes on to say in that day when the
[1:55:18] almond tree flourishes
[1:55:22] the desire of man shall fail
[1:55:26] because he goes to his long home
[1:55:30] anybody know what long home means
[1:55:32] he goes to his eternal home
[1:55:38] the almond tree flourishes
[1:55:41] oh praise god
[1:55:43] when does the almond tree flourish
[1:55:46] brother brown says the church
[1:55:48] now
[1:55:51] then he explains that he says
[1:55:52] has come to a place
[1:55:56] that the people are realizing
[1:56:11] living in human
[1:56:34] they have not recognized the awakening
[1:56:36] of the bride
[1:56:38] they know something's supposed to
[1:57:07] step into the holy of holies
[1:57:11] all of a sudden there's a shaking
[1:57:14] you're wrong you're dry running
[1:57:17] it's starting to to move something's
[1:57:20] moving
[1:57:21] what's going on
[1:57:27] [Applause]
[1:57:48] established in the church through the
[1:57:50] holy spirit i believe it's called
[1:57:53] close enough
[1:57:55] it's a lot of weight
[1:57:59] it's hard right now
[1:58:01] and it needs somebody someone strong
[1:58:19] it needs someone strong
[1:58:22] stand with me
[1:58:24] and not just anyone
[1:58:27] anybody can stand by my side
[1:58:32] if he destroys me she destroyed me i
[1:58:35] don't know how strong you are to make it
[1:58:42] because this elder
[1:58:46] talking about about his ministry
[1:58:49] this elder porque
[1:58:51] brings the former reign
[1:58:54] alder means the former one
[1:58:59] which means the former reign rain
[1:59:02] then there has to be what is called the
[1:59:04] latter rain that comes
[1:59:08] and then he says that latter rain
[1:59:10] is you yes
[1:59:14] that's the rain of the harvest
[1:59:17] and you
[1:59:18] are the harvest
[1:59:21] but it cannot come
[1:59:23] until the elder brings the former reign
[1:59:28] which is the
[1:59:43] so when he says when the former reign
[1:59:46] and the latter rain
[1:59:49] come together
[1:59:54] when
[1:59:55] the almond tree
[1:59:57] flourishes or blooms
[2:00:01] former rain and latter rain come
[2:00:03] together
[2:00:05] in home time now
[2:00:07] this is the awakening
[2:00:09] as the awakening is the resurrection
[2:00:24] application
[2:00:38] what about the rest of them you know
[2:00:41] the great revival fire is not burning
[2:00:45] but what is it
[2:00:46] it's the end time seed sign is
[2:00:50] the words that have been sown
[2:01:04] the spirit of god begins to fall
[2:02:10] time of the rapture will be the
[2:02:12] awakening of the dead
[2:02:16] together
[2:02:44] may there be such a revival
[2:02:48] and an awakening amongst us
[2:02:53] till the holy ghost
[2:03:26] of the lord
[2:03:30] he's praying

[2:44:00] specialist
[2:44:07] and then i want to ask our brother
[2:44:09] julian hill if he'd come and give us a
[2:44:10] quick announcement amen
[2:44:29] been a long time since i've been in
[2:44:30] front of all of you like this
[2:44:35] watch out tonight there might be a blue
[2:44:36] moon
[2:44:40] so
[2:44:41] we have an interesting project for you
[2:44:43] an amazon project
[2:44:57] how many believe that jesus christ is
[2:44:58] the same yesterday today and forever
[2:45:04] okay good this is going to go really
[2:45:05] well
[2:45:09] a couple of days ago me and the pastor
[2:45:10] got together and we came up with an idea
[2:45:16] as much of you know i am a writer and
[2:45:18] much a better writer than i am a speaker
[2:45:25] but most of the works i've written are
[2:45:26] works of fiction
[2:45:32] and most of them though they are
[2:45:34] powerful are not as powerful as the
[2:45:36] truth
[2:45:41] entertainment is great but the truth is
[2:45:43] greater then
[2:45:48] so we came up with an idea and i said
[2:45:51] stories are really powerful
[2:45:57] if you might have heard some of the
[2:45:59] stories i had heard that night your mind
[2:46:02] might have just
[2:46:03] gone away
[2:46:05] last
[2:46:10] and these stories aren't just stories
[2:46:11] from the bible they're not just stories
[2:46:13] from brother branham's time
[2:46:15] stories
[2:46:18] the stories that are happening right now
[2:46:22] there's stories that you could walk up
[2:46:24] to somebody and they might tell you you
[2:46:26] wouldn't believe it
[2:46:30] some stories that will make your faith
[2:46:32] grow beyond what you could imagine
[2:46:43] the word of the lord is a very bright
[2:46:45] and a very dark place
[2:46:47] the word of the lord is a very bright
[2:46:49] and a dark place
[2:46:53] but the stories we aim to tell you will
[2:46:55] make you grow in the lights
[2:47:00] so this is where you come in
[2:47:04] as fantastic as my my imagination might
[2:47:06] be is what i believe
[2:47:11] the stories that you can tell will be
[2:47:13] greater
[2:47:14] than the series
[2:47:16] some of you might have witnessed a
[2:47:18] miracle yes
[2:47:22] some of you might have seen something in
[2:47:23] the missionary field that you just might
[2:47:26] have never even thought to repeat
[2:47:31] and some of you might just have a
[2:47:32] testimony so tremendous it would rock
[2:47:34] somebody's world
[2:47:35] testimonial
[2:47:38] if you would like to share these stories
[2:47:40] there's going to be pieces of paper as
[2:47:41] you walk out
[2:47:47] there's going to be contact information
[2:47:48] to get a hold of me via email mail and
[2:47:51] phone number
[2:47:52] information
[2:47:57] and you can also write on the paper and
[2:47:58] just attach as many papers as you'd like
[2:48:03] when you give these stories back i will
[2:48:05] use the gift that god has given me to
[2:48:06] work with him in putting your story
[2:48:08] together
[2:48:13] um
[2:48:17] not to change it at all or make it
[2:48:18] fluffy but to tell it in a way that'll
[2:48:20] just grip you nope
[2:48:22] [Music]
[2:48:25] and it'll be exciting some of them will
[2:48:27] be sad and some of it might be scary
[2:48:33] but i promise you at the end of it
[2:48:35] you will know
[2:48:38] if you don't already know
[2:48:40] that jesus christ is the same yesterday
[2:48:46] that's really it that's all i had to say
[2:48:48] like i said the papers are in the back
[2:48:49] with more instructions
[2:48:54] and we'll be we'll be releasing these i
[2:48:56] believe episodically
