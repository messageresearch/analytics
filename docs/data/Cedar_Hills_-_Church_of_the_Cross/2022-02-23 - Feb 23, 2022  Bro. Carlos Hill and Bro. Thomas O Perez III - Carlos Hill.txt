no other power can do [Music] what no other power can do we can have an opportunity to rise up on the wings of eagles tonight it's the eagle that thrives on a night like tonight because he raises up on the winds it's an ideal time for him to be in the air flying because he can go higher and higher and higher and i i i have this cool echo i don't know where it's coming from but it's awesome i i i was was kind of struggling trying to get my thoughts together different different things and and and this is this is where the lord took us so we'll go down that road casting all your care upon him for he careth for you enchanted but i i i was i was of course and you have to be uh hiding under a rock to not look around in the world and see all the turmoil and things going on and there's wars and rumors of wars and there's all these different things going on and it and it it causes us to to to maybe sometimes be concerned be panicked be afraid and as a believer you you want to try to to to look at the different things and i find my conversations more and more i have that sometimes with brother enzo or brother jimmy lorenzo romano and you're trying to understand how the different things in the world that are happening how do they how do they how will they play out how does it fit into god's plan of according to what brother branham where where am i at in my spiritual walk where am i at with the lord am i am i ready for him to come the hour is to figure out where we're at and and i wanted i want to take it tonight a little bit along the lines of a message that our apostle preached and he preached the message entitled the formula of life and and as i as i hear that message and and i hear him and he starts off and and he starts looking at and analyzing science and and and he looks at science and he says you know i marvel at science behind my because even though science is a perversion of god it it shows something and what it shows is i but you find out they don't look back they don't go back they keep moving forward they said that automobiles would travel at such a speed that if they had a head-on collision well they would just pass right through each other they couldn't imagine a day where cars would do 200 miles an hour but we have production cars that will do that all day is constantly trying to come up with different explanations [Music] they never consider it a mistake science will look at something that they said and they'll say you know what that was a learning opportunity we didn't get that quite right but you know what it's not a negative negative so when i i start to look at my own life and and i find myself many times struggling with a lot of regrets and i hope you don't mind that i get a little bit personal tonight [Music] [Music] and i've been working through a whole bunch of things that are going on in my head and everything that i go through i keep coming back to the same thing i made a mistake at this point and then i and i come back and i go if i could just make a different decision if i if i would have just approached this situation from a different way if i could have just known this information when i made this decision then i could have been i could have been in a better situation and and every time i do that i add something that i carry and i continue to carry these things so every time forgive me but every time i i make a decision or i i look back i start carrying things and after a while the spas in tiempo i start learning something that the human being can do that we were never meant to do it and that is to function in dysfunction functionality maybe something happened that maybe someone offended me i'll give me and at every time that i carry that cargo esto then then then something else happens and i add some more alcohol and i'm carrying all of this dysfunction and and i'm still able to kind of function you ever you ever had your hands full or maybe you're you're making food or something and you need to like swipe the page on your tablet or your phone who's ever used your nose and every day that we operate and then we move forward and then we go and and maybe maybe maybe something bad happens with our finances maybe we're not where we thought we should be in life maybe maybe we've been hurt by our family maybe we've been hurt by our friends kisa maybe the people that are closest to us have abandoned us and hurt us and we carry dysfunction this function and i come to service on sundays domingo on wednesdays the song leader says raise your hands because god forbid i lose any that anger a lot of times is what fills the voids that i have yes and it keeps me safe i won't let that go there's no way i'm going to let that go you know where the hell is science and science has no regrets they don't look back on mistakes so why do we enthusiastic because i'm full of dysfunctional and the lord says that's not for you to carry yes my will is not for you to carry that but it's your choice and so he steps back this is all right pretty soon my arms are getting tired and something really weird happens right about that time because about that time you can't carry anything else one of these guys drops off you know and we spend more time going after that one thing and then we associate with with people and things thank you brother for bringing back my my back to me and we have friends that'll bring that right back to us and this is my new formula formula there's a formula that they talk about formula called the formula of frustration the formula you ever been frustrated the formula for frustration looks like this frustration fabricated expectations expectations plus failed realities must i made that up [Music] that giant mansion i'm supposed to live okay i i made that up yo but guess what people saw this game and i live in a two-bedroom apartment and i look at god and i'm frustrated lord i don't understand i don't get it why am i not where i'm supposed to be when the reality of it is you're exactly where he wants you to be done but because we've fabricated so much reality which is why reality tv is so dangerous what was that really reality tv social media is so dangerous because it's fabricated reality [Music] and i find out that the bible in cuento calabria is full of these formulas and they're beautiful formulas you see the formula for life the formula is simply the new birth that's the formula for life but how can i get to that place you see because the new birth you got to be able to embrace it with everything you got okay but i can't even free up my arms to raise my hands that's the formula for baptism this is the formula you see the formula for baptism you take john 3 5 and you add first peter 1 22. again and then you add some just a little bit of john 3 1. and a whole bunch of first corinthians 15 51. you know and what you get is baptism ilocus but then i find out that there's even more formulas and i find the formula formula and i find the formula for letting go ayola formula and i find that the formula for letting go is in first john 1. [Applause] just as if i never made those mistakes as if i never made those decisions because i understand but continue i'm not where i want to be you and we receive the baptism of the holy spirit baptism upon baptism baptism is talking about israel and it becomes line upon lying precept upon where i can understand the next formula which is the formula for the way that a man is placed in the body i find the formula for the perfection of the saints and i go to ephesians 4 11. oh and the bible tells me oh and he gave someone anybody [Music] [Music] me and brother jim have been talking about the ascension of the beast from the bottomless pit del posto we know that he goes into the pit i drawing he begins to draw the attention to himself nations and people are looking for an answer but they can't come together under politics it won't come under under this ideology but i like what our pastor said in the office he said you see the difference the difference between when he went into the bottomless pit never in the history of the world has had to deal with with manifested sons of god he's never had to come up against that and he's never come up against the force it's the formula of life as we begin to draw nigh unto the lord and time begins to close down and i look and i look around and i see all the things that our apostle talked about and i hear his messages and i think to myself logo lord senor i feel that yo i can see in myself the manifestation of a and it's the question is simply this i got the dismissal prayer i got i got a dismissal prayer how do i see myself but the more that they look masculine parents i want you to know this the more that they look they see themselves and i began they will all be manifested sons and daughters able to meet the challenge of the day and let all hell come but as long as we stand as a tree planted by those rivers of living waters we shall not be moved may god bless you [Applause] wow wow he told me in the back i don't have much to say i think he had a lot to say tonight can we give one to the lord and one to god's servant this evening [Applause] i'm going to ask you to please stand for the reading of the word and i'm going to take the line that our that our pastor gave to our young people this year it's found in the book of second timothy chapter 1 and verse 6 it says wherefore i put thee in remembrance that thou stir up the gift of god which is in thee by the putting on of my hands may god add his blessings to the reading of the word you may be seated i i want each one of you to look at each other maybe just turn around and look at your neighbor and and i want you to know that each person next to you has a gift how many know that so each one of us has a gift this gift wasn't just given to us by anybody that it doesn't matter how gifted you are if your gift is not active so i'm going to tell you something i'll go that that here is paul pablo and paul's getting ready to be executioned he's getting ready to die and he writes to timothy and you're going to say hey timothy try to do your best bro no from the apostle this is what is called upon us in this it says i come and i can re i can i'm going to baptize you unto repentance that can start your brother he would say some crazy stuff like what was wrong with this guy then i read the story again that just sit there on his ipad all day and say google how do i get the holy ghost he was the man that was something that was stirred up one thing that was so tremendous to me about peter tantra one day jesus tells him to cast his net to the other side we all know the story he brought up all the fish the pastor came to you said satan has come to and asked to sift your sweet [Music] jesus and neither does our pastor ever give up on us he said what i have prayed for that's your faith get to faith it will never fail you no [Applause] and one day preaches a message now i didn't find this in the bible i found it i found it through historians we know what message he preached in the upper room fuego everybody it's like i never read it before because i wouldn't read it again did you know every miracle jesus did was in full operation in the book of acts something here was peter pedro bible says that the shadow of peter la sombra de pedro that just the shadow solo sombra healed the sick now the story said that in the city that peter lived in historia pedro many sick people came veneer and the difference was this they believed this they went they said if peter doesn't have the time to put his hands on me you don't have the time to pray for me for me they were the ones that came with the faith and they said this yen just my life few weeks later he gets to go home he calls me to his house to cut his hair they put me on hospice and you prayed for me they took me off the hospice list this is what i'm trying to tell you let's get all that seed our god he can do mighty wonders do it don't matter if you fall down and make a mistake important that gift belongs to the people pueblo you see that there's people great famous singers all started in church their daddies were preachers look it up no answer to god for that but let me tell you when you can activate your gifts that when ruthie gets up here to sing when the ruth bienica that all of hell the name of the lord [Applause] jesus you have to jump up and down and slowly on fire you just got to make sure your gift is active whatever it is let it be active let it be working you'll you know my grandpa used to tell me go clean the church go we need the yard the littlest things i read the story of samson what is the purpose of these foxes though find that there's the foxes that'll spoil the vine so you find out these little foxes that's why people they'll drag their self sometimes to church and then or they'll drag themselves to to pray or read their bible time for this yeah because your vines have foxes you know it takes you know if you want your children to act

is [Music] me [Music] but just when i thought it [Music] was just for me [Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] how [Music] [Music] [Music] for me [Music] my words your gifts matter doesn't matter if you're a musician or an artist or a poet god can use these gifts to help or for his glory thank you all for gaining your time when you disagree with someone that doesn't have to stop us from turning our arm around them and call him a brother and call her our sister let's show christ in our heart and do it with love and respect hebrews 13 1 says let brotherly evil continue or first of 3 8 finally all of your be of one mind having compassion for one another love us brothers be tenderhearted be courageous sometimes i disagree with my family and friends but that doesn't mean i should not come without any friends let's show who should be in our heart a new faith was brought to joseph during that journey and just like me i feel like the same thing happened to me sort of so for a while before i came here to new mexico i was kind of exploring my faith but i was going in directions that i don't think were the right direction that really know what the truth was exactly um i was watching these videos and these other things about like christianity but it wasn't exactly what i am pursuing today which is this church and i'm very thankful for every single one of you guys i decided that i was going to ask my mom why they need me after who they did and does anybody remember sister ruby frost that's who they named me after brother brandon makes a statement he says it was the very thing that they brought identified who they thought he was and that that caused that uh that caught my attention because they did not know um 100 that that was the messiah you know through revelation that that's how that's i believe this helped him and many times us we want to understand everything we hear we hear the word we want to take everything we want to understand it and complicate things instead of just believing what god has given us the sign that's there and through faith believing god says that that even the wise men but they took god what is what fitted them as what they thought of christ and how they wanted to be seen as a as a christian so so i i can i can apply that to my life and so that i want to be a good christian by using my gifts for the lord and and um so this paper is our gift let's say that brother random is saying that no matter what you do for your gift break it try to break it no matter what the devil tries to do to it your gift your gifts will always be with you whether you find it or not it's always in it and like i said before your mind what the devil [Music] is the hand of the lord all it takes is the hand of the lord to take your gifts and transform it into your crown well think about this maybe god ruined your plan so that your plan didn't ruin you focus on yourself now losing someone is sad but don't lose yourself trying to find them again what god has ahead of you is greater than what you have behind you so stop looking back and start looking forward because if you get carried away worrying about what could have been you'll miss out on what's happening i'm telling you not to just wait just wait and see why god had you wait what god is doing is beyond what you could ever pray or think of even in the waiting season god can move mountains in your favor i'm not sure who needs to hear this conceivably but one day you'll look back and be grateful that it went god's way the devil wants to make things seem hard seem rough but that's how we get uh things in this world may seem hard but like my brother says [Music] [Music] [Music] is [Music] hey [Music] [Music] few [Music] [Music] oh [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Applause] [Applause] [Music] according to some inside information it's going to be fire [Music] that's what our brother abraham told me so hello [Music] so we don't want to miss that amen and of course our our pastor will be preaching in el paso this sunday este domingo na su pastor va predicando vasta predicandon el paso so you're all invited if you would like to go follow the stand
