[0:08] say
[0:08] it's the title of this is the patmos
[0:13] vision it took place in 80
[0:16] between 1895 and 96.
[0:20] the place was at the isle of patmos
[0:24] its location is 30 miles
[0:27] off of the coast of asia

[0:35] ephesian church in the a agency
[0:38] board by the mediterranean that's the
[0:40] position where it's at
[0:42] question the reason why john was there
[0:47] a godly man a righteous man
[0:50] a man of good reputation good character
[0:52] never in trouble
[0:54] why was this man there the bible said
[0:56] for the word of
[0:58] god in the testimony of jesus christ
[1:01] now we got the city the isle of patmos
[1:06] in the agency 30 miles off the coast
[1:10] approximately 30 miles around it rocky
[1:12] full of blizzards and scorpions and so
[1:14] forth
[1:15] and used for a prison house like
[1:18] alcatraz this they get a prisoner they
[1:20] can't keep in prison nearly
[1:21] so such a horrible criminal they put him
[1:24] out on alcatraz
[1:25] and now the toughest sainted john the
[1:28] divine
[1:29] the life of the disciples and the only
[1:32] one who died a natural death
[1:35] john before going to the island was
[1:37] accused of being a witch
[1:40] [Music]
[1:43] i was born in a bat of greece for 24
[1:47] hours without scorching it
[1:48] [Music]
[2:03] [Music]
[2:07] the romans give that he was a witch and
[2:09] bewitched
[2:10] the greeks
[2:13] what the carnal mind can think of oh
[2:16] what a setting now
[2:17] [Music]
[2:18] all right the church then
[2:22] honored john or under great persecution
[2:25] john writes the ninth verse
[2:26] by john who also am your
[2:30] brother and triple a and companion in
[2:32] tribulation
[2:33] and in the kingdom and in the patience
[2:36] of jesus christ was
[2:38] in the isle that is called patmos for
[2:40] the word of
[2:41] god and for the testimony of jesus
[2:44] christ
[2:45] in other words he took the word of god
[2:48] and was proving it that was the word of
[2:50] god
[2:51] and christ came back through him and
[2:52] testified that he was right
[2:55] amen john was a prophet we know that and
[2:58] so they were asking these questions so
[2:59] god
[3:00] just had the roman empire to pick him up
[3:02] and set him out there on he said now
[3:03] come on
[3:04] john i want to show you something that's
[3:05] going to happen the last of the apostles
[3:08] do you want no more to write it but john
[3:10] saw the
[3:10] setting out on the isle of patmos from
[3:12] 1895 until 1896
[3:15] and he wrote it and he said i am your
[3:18] brother and companion
[3:20] in tribulation he got in the spirit
[3:24] before anything
[3:25] took place the first thing he did he was
[3:28] in the aisle called patmos
[3:29] all these things that he did and he said
[3:31] i heard a voice and all these other
[3:33] things
[3:33] but before anything took place he was in
[3:36] the spirit
[3:36] and if you notice that your bible big
[3:38] capital spirit
[3:40] holy spirit amen he got in the spirit
[3:46] oh i just think that's wonderful i was
[3:49] in the spirit on the lord's day
[3:52] be careful john you've entered into the
[3:54] spirit
[3:55] something's going to be revealed to you
[3:56] what is it a trumpet sound the first
[3:58] thing
[3:59] [Music]
[4:06] repent now before the time's too late
[4:09] i'm alpha
[4:10] and omega that's the first thing that he
[4:12] let him know who he was
[4:14] who's this approaching is just king
[4:16] jesus king god king holy ghost he said
[4:18] i'm all of it
[4:20] i'm from a to z i'm the beginning and
[4:24] the ending i'm the immortal eternal one
[4:29] now and i turned to see the voice that
[4:32] spake under me
[4:33] and being turned i saw seven golden
[4:37] candle sticks my did you notice
[4:42] stars candlesticks lamps
[4:46] what does it mean what does this mean
[4:49] that the dispensation that we're living
[4:50] in is nighttime
[4:53] channels and lights and stars mean night
[4:57] and what does a star do it reflects the
[5:00] light of the sun
[5:02] until the sun returns amen blessed be
[5:05] the name of the lord
[5:06] now that's watching us a little further
[5:09] as we take the rest of this
[5:11] uh 13th verse and in the midst that's
[5:14] the middle
[5:15] of the golden candlesticks one like the
[5:18] son of man
[5:19] pull with the garment down to the foot
[5:21] and gird it about the paps
[5:23] with a golden girdle and john
[5:27] showed that he wasn't in the day of his
[5:29] prophecy as a prophet
[5:31] neither was he come out into the days of
[5:33] his kingship
[5:34] but he was in the day of the lord as a
[5:37] judge
[5:38] now how many knows that the priest
[5:41] having his
[5:41] girdle is strained around his waistline
[5:44] meant he was in service
[5:46] anyone who reads the testaments and
[5:47] knows the old testament knows that now
[5:49] watch
[5:49] these seven things here he misses his
[5:51] head his hair
[5:53] his eyes his feet his voice
[5:57] seven things he mentioned you're the
[5:58] sevenfold glory of jesus christ let me
[6:01] read it
[6:02] his head and his hair was white as wool
[6:06] as white as snow his eyes were flames of
[6:09] art
[6:10] now now i noticed the first thing that
[6:13] we noticed
[6:14] his head and his hair was white like
[6:18] wool his head and his hair
[6:22] was quite light warm
[6:27] now it does not mean that he was
[6:30] aged did this that wasn't the reason of
[6:33] it he wasn't aged to do this
[6:35] he was it was because of his experience
[6:38] and qualification and his wisdom
[6:41] because he's eternal and eternal cannot
[6:44] age
[6:46] you understand head hair
[6:49] eyes were like flames of fire
[6:54] think of it those eyes who once was dim
[6:57] with human tears
[7:00] now to come flames of fire
[7:03] now let's see we'll soon down the end of
[7:05] the page now
[7:07] hair like wall and his eyes were flames
[7:11] of fire
[7:11] and his feet uh a feet like a brass
[7:14] burned in a furnace and his voice
[7:18] the sound of many water
[7:24] voice of many waters what does waters
[7:27] represent
[7:28] if you want to mark it down turn to
[7:30] revelation 17 15
[7:32] and you'll find the bible says the water
[7:33] switched our source is
[7:35] sickness and multitudes and people in
[7:37] tongues
[7:38] it's a judgment the bias of the
[7:41] ministers
[7:43] through the holy spirit that's crying
[7:45] out to the people
[7:47] never age standing there wash the many
[7:50] waters
[7:52] cry out sickness demolition the voice of
[7:55] those
[7:56] seven stars in his hands i ever church
[7:58] age preaching the baptism the holy ghost
[8:00] the baptism in jesus name
[8:02] speaking in tongues the power of god the
[8:04] resurrection of christ the second coming
[8:06] divine judgment the voice of many waters
[8:10] for this one it looked like the son of
[8:12] man
[8:13] mary water wash out hair
[8:18] like wool and eyes like plain safar
[8:22] feet like brave and a voice of many
[8:25] waters
[8:26] and he had in his right hand seven stars
[8:31] now the seven stars that was in my right
[8:34] hand he had seven stars
[8:36] in his right hand which means the seven
[8:37] ministers of seven ages
[8:40] it's beautiful he held them in his right
[8:42] hand think
[8:43] right hand doesn't exactly mean like
[8:46] christ sitting on god's right hand
[8:47] it doesn't mean that god's got a right
[8:49] hand because god is the spirit
[8:50] but christ was the right hand of power
[8:54] and remember the seven stars was in his
[8:57] right hand just think they were drawing
[9:00] their curse
[9:02] their light from him they were
[9:04] completely under his control
[9:07] in his right hand every true servant of
[9:11] god is the same way
[9:12] now the seventh and last um
[9:16] a representation of this person and out
[9:19] of his mouth
[9:20] goes a sharp two-eighth sword
[9:25] i mean that's the sixth one out of his
[9:27] mouth goes a sharp
[9:28] two-eighth sword a sharp two eight short
[9:32] what was going from the mouth of this
[9:33] person
[9:34] the word of god it's a sharp created
[9:37] sword
[9:38] what was it doing discerning the
[9:39] thoughts of the heart
[9:41] the intent goes even deeper than the
[9:43] meat
[9:44] the flesh the blood cells into the bone
[9:48] down into the
[9:52] of the thoughts and intents of the heart
[9:54] that's what the word of god does
[9:56] all right now one more quotation we
[9:59] touch the 20th
[10:00] so now let's see here on this first
[10:03] chair
[10:04] now the 16 and he
[10:07] had in his right hand seven stars now
[10:10] let's take the
[10:11] and uh the his countenances out of his
[10:14] mouth goes the sharp trade sword
[10:16] and his countenances were like the sun
[10:19] shining in its strength
[10:22] the prophet couldn't stand the lord he's
[10:24] such a vision
[10:25] he just he just sapped his strength and
[10:28] he fell right down
[10:30] now watch and he laid his right hand
[10:32] above me saying unto me
[10:34] fear not i am the
[10:38] first and the last
[10:41] oh but not a prophet
[10:45] god i am the first and the light
[10:49] i'm the first of the revelation the last
[10:51] of the revelations
[10:52] i'm he that was and he that is and he
[10:55] that will come
[10:56] that's the i am a lady's right hand upon
[11:00] me saying

[11:03] last
[11:04] i am he that liveth and was dead
[11:07] and behold i am a lifeboard ever more
[11:11] right now and then he screamed out
[11:14] amen and have the keys of
[11:18] hell and death now
[11:21] he gives a command and then we start to
[11:24] end the chapter
[11:25] the 19th verse write the veins which i
[11:29] have seen
[11:30] and the things which are and the things
