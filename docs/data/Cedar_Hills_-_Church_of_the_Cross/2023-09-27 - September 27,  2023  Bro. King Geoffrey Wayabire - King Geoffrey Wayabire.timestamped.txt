[47:30] to bring the word
[47:32] so if you don't want to jump into what
[47:35] the prophet says
[47:39] then something is going to be missing
[47:47] what are you doing in such a season
[47:51] whose child are you
[47:54] when they ask you
[47:57] who are you
[48:01] [Music]

[49:19] it will be terrible for a terrible
[49:23] if you're getting married
[49:25] and then someone comes and asks you who
[49:28] are you getting married to is
[49:33] to ask your
[49:35] bridesmaids
[49:40] who am I getting married too
[49:46] who am I getting married
[49:49] it would be such unfortunate okay
[49:53] if you're getting married to someone you
[49:55] don't know you would rather leave it
[50:01] You Should Know Who You Are
[50:06] it doesn't take me time to explain who I
[50:09] am
[50:10] soy it doesn't take me time to explain
[50:13] who my father was
[50:18] it doesn't take me time no necessito
[50:21] Tiempo because I know who it was
[50:28] DNA runs in me and so is
[50:34] DNA runs in me so are there any Quran me
[50:37] whose child are you they can't son is
[50:42] [Applause]
[50:48] if Pastor Caleb didn't love my father I
[50:50] wouldn't be here
[50:55] if this church didn't love my father I
[50:57] wouldn't be here see yes
[51:00] but because someone built a foundation
[51:03] with this church
[51:10] God shows you even before the
[51:13] foundations
[51:14] [Applause]
[51:17] it comes to attack you it touches his
[51:20] heart
[51:22] and it says who is affecting my child
[51:25] okay
[51:27] do you remember that you're a child of
[51:30] God and God loves you
[51:35] if you want to have fear in your life
[51:40] remember the prophet says
[51:43] circumstances shouldn't Define you
[51:46] circumstances
[51:59] you go through Define it
[52:02] remind them that you're a child of God
[52:14] we shouldn't be at the place where
[52:15] you're just trying to assume am I am I
[52:18] part of the the bride nothing
[52:22] is
[52:24] just assuming if you're part of the
[52:26] vision

[53:07] foreign
[53:14] the Bible says said in John a now
[53:19] then Jesus then sparked Jesus again unto

[53:55] that he took this part of the light and
[53:57] gave it to you

[54:05] the light overshadows you lose Sombra
[54:09] and that light speaks for you yes
[54:11] because it's in you
[54:16] you shouldn't be scared of any Darkness
[54:24] you shouldn't be tired or stressed about
[54:27] the darkness
[54:30] the light lives in you llama
