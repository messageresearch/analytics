sorry if I may make some faces or may not talk well because I just got braces and it's uncomfortable anyway god bless you all and I hope you guys are having a wonderful day and I'd like to thank my pastor for letting me be here today and to talk to you a little bit how how God does miracles and how God how God's promises and how and God's faith so if you don't mind please can you turn to your Bibles into second Corinthians 5:7 and it says for we walk by faith and not by sight so is it okay if I give you an example what that means okay so so whenever what that means is oh you may be seated sorry so what that means is like the smallest things in life that like let's say for an example whenever you're about to eat how many likes you I know saying I like lasagna and so uh so some people who like to pray for their food same I do too so uh whenever you pray for your food even the smallest things can become one of the most biggest things in life so but if you walk by sight that means like if you don't pray your food you never know it can be in there like let's say if you're gonna have a steak let's say and if you don't pray for it it could be very pink inside or there could be a hair inside there and it could be a bad things and so that's why we walk by faith that's why we believe in the Lord and that's why we never give up on him for the smallest things in life so faith means like faith means you don't give up on the Lord he always believed in the Lord and so it was okay if I could tell you my story about like how I believed in the Lord okay here we go so like three years ago I don't know if you most of you know that I got this sickness it's it was called HSP and it's where I couldn't walk for a week and my stomach was really hurting and I would throw up a lot I'm not trying to be gross but it was pretty bad and I put a lot and so uh and so now but it lingered and so like now if I walk for like an hour even my feet would I would be like oh my legs hurt already oh I can't even walk no more so but I didn't give up on the world and sorry and so what I did is I just and what I did is well we went out with Ricky and they said that I have five different symptoms or sicknesses on me and one of them is called fibromyalgia it's where your nerves get really sensitive and like even if you touch me like this that would probably hurt for some of the people that have it really bad and so what I did is I put the devil to the test and I said to I was on my bus stop and on my school they had football tryouts and so what I did is I use my friends phone and I called my mom and I told her I'm gonna play football and I I don't care what anybody else thinks if my legs hurt or when I get hit my nose will be messed up or something I just believe in the word all the time and I tell you my best to always praise them and so yeah that's not right now and so I have five other sicknesses but we just wanted to find them out and we just wanted to leave it in the Lord's hands and so I'm gonna tell you another story it was about my grandma Martina yeah one time she got very sick and the doctor said that she only had 30 more minutes to live and that and she wasn't gonna make it and so sorry and so but my family didn't believe in that they always believed in the Lord and so my family they called the pastor and some of the ministers and and it was only two minutes left before she was kamek on the next thing you know she lived for 10 more years the doctors couldn't figure out why he lived that long and it's because she thought the work so much her family did too that's why we always had that's why most of us go to church a lot it's okay if you miss a day or two but try to make the effort to serve the Lord and all the time try Union if you even if you're at work or at school like at lunch maybe you could pray real quick if like for example the people that went to Africa maybe you could pray for someone else that can be sick or has an addiction or it could be something and so before it you go I would like to give a little testimony again well in the office my uncle said that he had a very bad stomach ache that he didn't really he just said that his stomach was hurting on and so whenever brother Diego come in came in and he started praying for him and whenever he was praying for him I just hear I heard a little you go cry I heard I just heard it and I didn't know what that meant but I felt like the Lord was with me and so I thank you all for this time and God bless you [Applause] amen amen god bless you how many happy to be in the house of the Lord amen god bless our our brother Israel for that that a testimony that he gave on on his life I I was actually there when he was when he was really really sick I remember him in the hospital and he was uh he was he was he was in a lot of pain it was screaming and everything but I remember him he was rebuking the devil and still praising God and I think that was awesome a man thank you Israel we appreciate that anyways guys my name is sergeant eagle-eye today and the Lord sent me today to talk to all of you because he loves you guys he really really loves you guys he loves the children I am a soldier of God God has he's trained me to protect to help to to love to do everything that he wants us to do and I want to share with you a few things that that we do um a lot there's a lot of soldiers of God we heard a soldier of God today preaching we heard one interpreting we have deacons and Usher's you guys are soldiers of God too and some of the things that we do that that our pastor wants us to do the Lord wants us to do is for example will come like on Monday mornings and we'll be in prayer at 5:30 in the morning and it's awesome guys because when we're here believe it or not I know I can speak for myself but when I'm when I'm here praying and all of a sudden it's the craziest thing because I'll get I'll get like a thought I'll get a thought all of a sudden while I'm praying about my brother here or my sister here or what it could be anybody in the church but the Lord puts things in your mind in your in your heart to start praying for a brother maybe maybe they're having a rough time and they need prayer or something like that and the Lord has us do that the Lord has us reading the Word of God that's it that's another thing that he has us doing these are all things that we do as soldiers of God we read the message we come to church we fellowship we do everything everything everything that we can possibly do to be soldiers of God and like I said I know that there's some soldiers here too um I have a bandana because believe it or not we fight demons we fight the devil and we fight demons and the Lord says you know what you throw on your bandana today you put your bandana on today and I asked Lord why Lord well why should I put my bandana on today he said that's gonna help you keep the mind of Christ on and I was like wow Lord really so let me ask you guys a question who wants to help me I need some help okay who-who here who what's the mind of Christ what what is that my brother here yeah loving you in your loving okay my brother putting others before you before okay okay brother be nice to each other those are all those are all part of it yes thinking of others okay wow these are you know what you guys I think we have some soldiers of God here too what do you all feel yeah who wants who wants a bandana cuz that there's a soldier there's still soldiers here who's gonna raise your hand high who okay okay but but a soldier a soldier I wish our brother Benji was here that's another soldier of God he's with our pasture right now believe it or not they're all the way ten thousand miles away in Africa in Africa can you imagine that and our pastures over there he's training more soldiers to fight the devil and his demons also so he's training pastures and he's doing all that over there way over there ten thousand miles away but anyway I want to see who who wants a bandana who thinks that they're worthy to keep the mind of Christ on yeah they mean okay I gotta hear an amen first okay the soldiers soldiers

this is the mind of Christ on for all of you okay and you guys can go ahead and put it on and and a brother Israel he was talking about faith right how many how many know how many think who knows what faith is anybody what's faith faith in God okay believing in God okay okay well you know what we're gonna we're gonna try I need a volunteer who wants to I need a volunteer let me see here come he remember okay we're gonna we're gonna practice something okay we're gonna practice something we're gonna give it just we're gonna do a little exercise so we can understand faith just a little bit more okay okay well we're gonna do you're gonna have faith today okay in order to have faith we're gonna blindfold you though okay so I want you to come here my brother right here okay right here and we're gonna blindfold you you can't see nothing nothing close your eyes tight let me see oh no cheating you're like your dad you're gonna start trying to cheat somehow no cheating no our brother marts also a soldier of God and he's out there in Africa and he's he's helping our pastor out there amen okay can you see anything no okay cool all right this exercise what you're gonna do all you're gonna do is you're gonna listen to my voice okay we got to turn you though we got to turn you a couple times one two three okay right there now you're gonna have to take all right all you're gonna do is you're gonna listen to my voice okay all right so turn to your left you're the left okay and I want you to take three steps okay turn around and take three steps four steps forward take four steps forward okay now I want you to raise both hands drop them cool all right not bad not bad okay hang on one second don't move okay go ahead and now raise your right hand raise your left hand drop it okay now I want you to what I want you to do now I want you to sit down oh you're supposed to sit up the chair but you see now the brother did awesome okay that is faith you guys okay you listen to you listen to the words okay and the words kept him going to the left to the right but he didn't disbelieve at all he kept on believing and he sat down even when we asked him to sit down he laid down so I was like wow good job my brother awesome job buddy okay okay good job can we give him an applause all righty he did an awesome job okay you can go sit down my buddy yeah but you put your bandana back on okay cool so from this from this exercise guys from this exercise we see here that it's really really in all reality it's not that hard it's not that hard to have faith it's really really not now it's kind of hard to keep the faith though that's different when you have the faith and would you keep the faith through your journey that gets hard and you know why it gets hard because a lot of things they weigh us down okay a lot of things I need some help okay okay cool oh I got a lot of help here okay I want you to share with me something okay how many how many have a hard time anybody here have a hard time what about the girls you have a hard time okay leg in what tell me tell me a hard time you have a hard time in math okay I have a hard time Pat - that's crazy okay what about you huh PE yeah me too Wow jeez we have a lot of stuff in common okay my buddy over here what do you have in your school subjects okay okay what the thing about it is you guys is that if we're being realistic right we worship God and we're Christians and everything like that but the things that you mentioned are things in everyday life because we still live in this world right so I had those problems too when I was your age in math and different things whatever they were I had problems too okay because we're surrounded by the world right so I'm gonna give another example okay who wants to help me okay I need one of the girls to help me okay let me see Sophie come here come on up Sophie and then to let me out yeah come on come on you could come too come on okay all right so these girls are cracking up all right so let me let me give you guys an example okay I need you I'm gonna show you right now okay so we live in this world okay we're gonna say that this this this picture right here the water in this is is the world let's say that's the world okay and somebody without God without without being a Christian okay they have no protection from the world okay there is no protection whatsoever okay so we're gonna look here and this is the this is the person out in the world that has no protection whatsoever okay so one of your girls come okay I want you to put this in the water okay okay so remember okay this is the person that that has no that doesn't listen to God's word that doesn't know what a prophet is hasn't heard the message of the hour does it it doesn't do any of these things okay but yet they live in the world - but no protection right okay now you want to come here and you want to help me okay did you see the picture on that napkin you did okay I want you to pull it out and I want you to open it up open it up to show the face as best as you can okay okay right there what happened no protection from God or anything like that so look at the way this person ended up okay with holes in them they didn't listen to the pastor nothing like that so there was no protection so they ended up miserable they ended up long term without listening look at the way they ended up that's their life right there okay now what we're gonna do is we're gonna we're gonna have like one of you kids okay one of you guys that has the protection of God that listens to you the pasture listens to the ministry listens to everything that that that the Word of God says okay and we're gonna give another example okay come here Sophie okay I want you to put this in here this right here this is going to signify the protection of God okay so this is God's protection here okay remember this is the world okay so in God's protection I want you to push just push down real slowly okay all right okay right there okay thank you all right and God's protection this is going to be submerged in the world okay so we're all the way in can you guys I know it's a little hard to see but but this is the way it works okay you have the protection of God even though you're in the world there's there's there's a there's a protection around you guys okay so so whenever you go through life and you have different things happen to your life and stuff like that as long as you listen to God's Word and you're obedient to the pastor in the ministry and everything like that when you come out of that you come out okay and look what happens you're still good you see that so so that's why you guys okay that's why that's just an example to show you thank you girls I appreciate your help okay can we give them an applause so that's how God's protection works guys okay but we have to listen we always have to listen to what's being told to us what's being told to us again and I reiterate this a lot what's being told to us by our pasture by the assistant pastor the ministry the Word of God kids okay that's what we have to listen to now if you don't listen what happens how many know the story of Noah and the Ark who knows that story yeah okay what happened what happened all the people that didn't believe died right that's right okay what happened was Noah he had a message for everybody right and because because the world the world all around him was it was terrible it was bad there was their God looked down at the world and he saw and he just saw nothing but chaos just just bad stuff happening everywhere everywhere everywhere so he sent a message he sent Noah a message and he says you tell the people tell the people that I'm gonna destroy I'm gonna destroy the world I'm tired of this filthiness I'm tired of this and that and I'm gonna destroy them now what do you think the people did anybody can anybody tell me what the people did what they do they didn't listen no they didn't what else did they do what else did they they tried building or okay they laughed at him they laughed at Noah and laughed at him and laughed at him and they're like I can imagine them saying are you crazy really you're gonna it's gonna rain and you say it's gonna rain you know and flood the earth and kill everything you're crazy and they laughed at him and laughed at him as as Noah was being obedient to instructions God gave him he was still being obedient right but but what happened at the very end at the very end what happened all the people that didn't believe they died yes now I'm gonna ask you guys a question ok cuz that was in the days of Noah does anybody ever get like laughed at anybody like that I still get laughed at today what what did you get what do you get laughed at the way you dress they laugh at you ok ok anybody what about the girls you does any other girls get laughed at I've heard some of the girls say that they used to get laughed at because they were skirts and stuff like that but we were sent a message right who who we sent the message from can anybody help me with that any of the girls tell me who sent this a message brother branham right brother branham sent us a message he good job yeah you kids are sharp so he sent this a message he sent a message of restoration right and the Ark that Noah was talking about now brother branham brings it to our Ark nowadays is Christ Jesus right how many believe that you guys believe that okay now can you now brother branham okay how many how many how many have seen his picture how many hear his messages yeah okay can you believe this or not but brother Branham also had a rough time growing up he really really did this is the prophet of the age okay brother Branham when he was growing up he got tempted to do bad things like drink just do bad bad things but he had God he had a work to do there was a work to do okay and how many know what his work was what was his work to preach the gospel right yeah good job yeah exactly but he had a work to do so he would have this voice that said don't defile don't do these bad things because I haven't work for you to do okay and what we wanna instilled in you guys I want you guys to always always always remember this okay cuz it's gonna sound weird and it's gonna sound funny now and everything like that but you guys need to keep yourselves clean you guys need to be good obey God's Word because you kids you you guys have a work to do you're gonna have a work to do these boys these young men that are here some of them are gonna be ministers there might even be a pastor amongst you guys there might be deacons or Usher's there might be there's gonna be there's gonna be a work for you boys to do and you girls are gonna be just as important you girls are just as important you girls are gonna have a work to do also so that's why it's so important guys to obey God's Word okay um now I wanna I wanna I want to talk to you guys about I'm not one of the last thing before we how many know the story how many know the story of the rich young ruler okay tell me a little bit about it because he was really rich okay that's right that's exactly right good job now this rich young ruler how many know what he wanted what did he he had everything he had money he had horses he had everything everything really money everything what do you what did he want power okay what else he had power but what else what else did he want anybody what do you want money okay he had money what he really really wanted and he went to Jesus okay he went to Jesus and told Jesus I want eternal life that's what he asked them how do I get eternal life okay now this is I need I'm gonna I'm gonna sit down here okay I'm gonna sit down right here with you guys and I need a volunteer who wants to be the rich young ruler in my region really yeah okay all right so this is the rich young ruler right here okay so the rich young ruler guys we see that he wanted an eternal life okay that's what he that's what he what he wanted and he would tell God and so he asked Jesus the question and Jesus said follow follow the commandments is what he told him in other words in in your in your guyses so you guys can understand me be good listen to your parents do all these things and that's awesome guys we need to do those things okay we need to do those things and the rich young ruler he told him he said you know what I've done all these things since I was born I've kept all these things and I've done him I've been good to my parents I pray I do all these things so then Jesus told him looked at him and told him well sell all that you have and follow me okay and we've heard this preached time and time again and maybe you guys have heard heard stories and stuff like that but what it boils down to kids is Jesus wanted to have a relationship with the rich young ruler that's what he wanted in the Bible he always refers to the rich young ruler as the rich young ruler he never calls him by name he never talked he never called him by name yet his friend that he loved Lazarus he called him by his named Lazarus when Lazarus died he said Lazarus wake up but the rich young ruler because there was no relationship he never referred to him by his name he always called him rich young ruler in the different verses that he speaks throughout the Bible he always called him that so he wants a relationship with you kids is what he wants that's what he wants and the rich young ruler was not gonna do that so thank you my buddy that's that's what he wants from you guys okay always remember always always remember that you have to be good you got to keep the commandments and everything like that but never never stop to search for that relationship with God okay and when you have a relationship with God kids it's not just a relationship that you get and it stays like that no because when you get a relationship you build off that relationship so you start a relationship and the relationship that you want to have with God is this is you and this is God this is our Lord Jesus Christ what you want to do is build off that and as you build you get closer and closer and closer and closer until you become so close with God in your relationship that you become one and that when I look at my brother here I don't see the difference if it's my brother or my Lord Jesus Christ and I see the Christ in my brother okay well guys that's what God wanted me to tell you guys remember keep our pastor in prayer god loves you guys Horus all his heart we love you all of our heart you guys are super valuable to us okay remember don't ever forget your value on how important you are to God okay god bless you guys a man how many enjoyed that
