all father we just want to tell you Lord that we love you with all of our hearts this morning Lord we give you thanks Lord for giving us another day of life Lord to be able to come and hear your word father as we begin this service Lord we just ask that your sweet Holy Spirit move all in this place father we ask Lord that you bless the minister today Father this morning bless everybody online that is watching father we thank you and we love you Lord amen amen amen you may be seated at this time we're going to be uh watching a video our brother uh William Mariam brandham amen William Mar br good morning friends it's a privilege to be here this morning in the service of the Lord and all the teachings of this book there's not one verse that you can put your finger on but what with the grace and the help of the holy spirit that we can Tide Genesis of Revelations right into it amen there's not another piece of literature written anywhere that can do that but but you know God sometimes makes some of the to our opinion some of the most foolish choices now God seen a little hook NOS Jew just as full of temper as he could be with his mouth setting sideways I'll go down rest every one of them I'll I'll throw them in jail I'll do this God said that's my choice right there oh you spoke with tongues oh you shouted run up down the aisles and cried tears like You' been peeling onions that don't mean one thing not one thing unless that everyday life backs up just exactly he knew he had to face Pharisees he had to face Sadducees he had to face the world and the Gentile world and so Paul this Bible is written this book of Hebrews is written for that purpose he's shaking those Hebrews and taking that Old Testament and showing it over here in the New Testament this is God he said amen here it is on on all the prophets and everything he was the angel that led the children of Israel in this light through the Wilderness he returned back to that same light and Paul saw it out of the Old Testament amen he said I'm Jesus the angel of the Covenant and when Paul seen that he said sure that was him and here he is this morning doing the same thing the Scripture vindicates it the camera vindicates it now that reason I refer to that picture it isn't because I'm there I'm I'm just a sinner Save By Grace like you are but what I'm trying to say is it's his presence with us that's the main thing now what did God do now Paul's trying to speak what is it led them out of Egypt was it Moses No Moses was a flesh instrument and listen for some when they had heard did provoke how many knows that the Israelites provoke god with their unbelief amen they murmured they completely God walked right down there when they got out the first thing they got in trouble God loves to bring you in trouble he loves to put trouble down and see what you'll do about it so he just stopped up the Red Sea and the first thing you don't marched him right out into this place then sent Pharaoh after him see how God likes to do it he loves to display his power and love he's God and he just loves to show you who he is could you imagine god with his with his Sanctified holy people led them right out in this trap then got him out of that trap and let him run out here where there's no water when he could have tuck him somewhere where there was water oh you're unbelief you provoke me to anger because of unbelief think of it you've got to separate yourself from that dogma of the world ah them days of Miracles just passed there's no such a thing as that that's ftic ISM separate yourself the Bible said come out from among them and be ye separated sayth the Lord and I will receive you I will receive you after you separate yourself you shall be my children I'll be your God separate yourself don't yoke yourself up with unbelievers that's right young man getting married marrying some girl that don't believe or some young girl married a boy that don't believe you do that I don't care how cute he is and and how cute she is and what those big eyes she's got they'll all fade out one of these days but brother your soul will to live forever be careful what you're doing she ain't a real believer him a real believer don't you yoke yourself up like that stay away from such it'll cause you trouble down the road he's speaking to the Christians now don't you let this same gospel that was preached back on Earth in signs and wonders and a pillar of fire let him when these things go to takeen place again don't you fall over the Wayside by unbelief to go to dton for their carcass fell in the wilderness but now we remove into a dispensation and don't you harden your heart don't you act like they did in the days of provocation when they provoke God how they do it not believe in him morally let me grind this down to you you said brother R I go to church that's all right I never lied in my life that's fine I never stole I never done this that that's very fine that's all good but that still isn't sin the sin is when God shows himself and you disbelieve it each one of them prophets know just what the other Prophet had said and know that their Spirit was the same and they was watching oh brother that hard to shake us out of our word and condition there you are let the world say what they want do and do what they want do blessed be the name of the Lord Keep Me In Christ if I'm called anything a fanatic or holy ruler someday he's coming and those that are in Christ will God bring with him when he comes it's all a spiritual revealed truth laying right there and it takes a spiritual mind to catch it rest on that through the day think of it even if you do without your dinner think of it just bless us now and keep us humble let our hearts be open our Minds clear to the things of God for we ask it in Christ's [Applause] [Music] name amen amen can you please stand how many enjoyed that how many enjoyed that what a voice amen amen it's the life behind the [Music] name oh it's the life behind the name that makes those demons tremble it's the life behind the name that makes the proud heart humble it was God who devised the plan that in all things like a man who could live who give to us that life behind the name it's the life behind the name that makes those demons tremble it's the life behind the name that makes a proud heart humble it was God who divides the plan that in all things like a man he could live so he he could give to us that life behind the name oh and I've got to out of to walk and the blind to see then it opens present doors sets the captiv

man I am how insignificant that I am I am a nobody Lord and at the same time I know and I Rec recognize of your greatness of your power speak unto us this morning Lord in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ don't allow anything to come out of my mouth that would hinder your children permit that only words of living life could come out in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ I ask this amen amen and before you seated if you wouldn't mind greeting your neighbor and you may be seated and the before we get started with the word of the Lord this morning I would like to express my gratefulness or unto the Lord Jesus Christ for permitting one of my greatest dreams to come to reality be able to be here with all of you I wish to honor the memory of our precious brother Tomas perz I love our brother thas pis and even though his body may not be here we know that he continues to live our God is a god of the living not of the Dead I would like to also personally thank our pastor Caleb perz would like to thank his wife and his children I would like to greet the peris family and their fames and their wives and children I want to greet all of you i' like to express my gratitude and love towards all of you I arrived to this beautiful country on the 14th of November Phoenix to be able to visit and be and attend the conventions at Phoenix and to also honor the invitation of our brother perz pH I bring greetings from Phoenix Tabernacle and also from the Garcia family isari my name is Jes cavari chakal per I originate from Peru and as long as I'm in this country I'm going to be an American I would also like to express the greetings from my wife Caro my marshmallow she is the best thing that has ever happened to me my best friend and the perfect companion my uh bodyguard and at times my conscience and she also sends her greetings in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ bring greetings from the three beloved from uh my wife I have three children and the oldest is going to bege Roberto Peter Robert uh peterel and the second one isge Angelo elizth and the third one is B Elizabeth Elizabeth I like the number three three is perfection I was able to come to the gospel in 1978 by the grace of God and this message arrived unto me by God's grace by 1980 I was just a teenager I fell in love with this message I grew up up hearing about the heroes in the Bibles I fell in love with Moses I fell in love with Joshua I fell in love with all the Patriarchs I fell in love with each and every one of those characters and when I arrived into this message by his grace I learned that God is Not only a god of history but a god of the present and I began to hear the name of other Heroes and of course we know brother brandham I began to hear about arus Paul Columbo and the more that I read about them I fell more in love with them Wesley I fell in love with Wesley I fell in love with Charles uh Fus I'm still in love with them but nonetheless for my benefit I began to hear about the uh Heroes of Our Generation I grew up hearing their names I heard brother Bernie Garcia Thomas perz enri enri Anaya and one day I heard about a brother Fabio Bernal I heard I remember the first time that I heard his name it was like as if I was looking up at the stars he was so tall and I was so small and for the first time yesterday I had the privilege to be able to hear him for more than two hours and I've been able to store up everything from what he told me yesterday and I met brother thas perz in 1995 and just by hearing him I knew that he was going to be Supernatural and I believe in the Supernatural and I'm a product of that Supernatural and in this morning I'm directing myself to the supernatural I don't only want a god from yesterday I want a present God so for me this is something that's really important to be able to express it because if it wasn't for these men that paved the way what would be of all of us the grace came in wrapped in human flesh a God in feet and I recognize that I'm amongst all of them the smallest and I'm very grateful for the amount of effort that these men have put forth let's give them an Applause to be able to leave their homes their families their children to leave the church and have money invested now I understand it in my own flesh it's the work that the Lord has called me to do I know the kind of pain it is to be able to leave your children and your wife behind now you understand now the pain that it is to leave your church and your brothers behind but I know that that is that there's no other greater calling than that and I've came to understand that eternal life is to live for others and when Jesus was hanging up on the cross he was living for eternal life someone has to die so That Others May Live every day something dies for somebody to be able to live that is the very essence of our existence and to be able to keep going forward the message that we preach and we believe has to be a part of our walk our talk and our thinking so in this morning I take advantage of this beautiful opportunity to be able to thank and greet our precious heroes from Las Cruses New Mexico I love the last name of peris some brothers tell me that that was the last name of adamz and here I find our brother Emilio Perez I love you my brother I fell in love since the very first time that I met you I ask that you forgive for the way that I speak am I can't do much more less than my last name is love my father is love I'm his son so I am love so and this morning I direct myself to the god of love the children and you are also love uh one time I saw a man take a horse by whipping and I saw how obedient that was and it was based of all the whiplashes and then I saw another man take another horse with sugar and I saw that sugar was love I ask that you forgive me for being so romantic as I knew this message or understood this message I couldn't help and the greatest Prophet that ever stepped on Earth was our Lord Jesus Christ and all of us are small poets and I hope that this may be a way or a manner of living and in this morning I also send bring forth the greetings from the church where I attend in the Missionary Church the blood of Jesus Christ never did I ever think that I would one day preached the gospel I didn't know that I was born for this when I came to Earth I thought that I was jari I didn't know what the purpose of my life was and now I live eternally grateful for this great honor to be able to speak to be able to preach and which is the greatest gift that the Lord has given us and in this morning I'm going to be resting upon this beautiful scripture of St Matthew If any man will come after me let him deny himself and take up his cross and follow me and we all know that we're all living in very Glorious Days never has a church ever lived in a time like this how privileged we are Abraham wanted to sit where you're at at this moment the prophets who wrote the Bible would give anything to be able to be where we're standing at this is the greatest day of all days the Earth is groaning and moaning for this great day the day of the manifestation of the sons of God and at the same time this is the worst and most dangerous time of all and see that nobody deceives you because many will come in my name and they will deceive to us there's no denomination that can come and deceive us a communist can't come and deceive us but when somebody comes and believes the same or says that they believe the the same thing that we do that's why we're now obligated to become one with this word to be able to come in an agreement with this word at a daily basis because these are dark and troubling days and as we see as the darkness grows how sin is growing I asked myself who is the one that's responsible for all and the easiest thing for me to do is to blame the devil poor devil and in this morning I'm not here to defend [Music] [Applause] him I'm here with the purpose to be able to see what our part is I'm not a product of just so and so we didn't come to have a picnic day we're children of a plan of a project and then for some reason God permitted us to be able to be born in this day we hope that all of us be able to will be able to see what that purpose is and as a man of this message but the greatest desire was to be a happy one be happy in my matrimony to be happy as a son be happy in the church to be able to back up the cause all of that was good but that's not enough there is still something greater and I always went along feeling empty inside and I never understood why I married the most beautiful woman in the world forgive me sisters and I have the most beautiful children in the world forgive me Brothers I have the greatest mother and the greatest Brothers forgive me please and I congregated in the greatest Church in the world and even though I had all of that I still felt empty inside and I didn't understand why and the Lord came on to me 25 years later after knowing this message and I had lost myself in a cage or in a jail cell that I created myself my own denomination ofari nobody put me in there I put myself in there and I incar incarcerated myself I never drank smoked and never went around with women but yet I was still lost in a jail cell that I created myself and then when I realized that that was my sad truth when I thought that there was nothing else left for me he came unto me when I least expected it and on the 12th of October of 2003 he came unto me I never went seeking for him he looked for me I was lost in the religion I thought it was enough just to be able to know this message I thought it was enough to be able to say that God sent a prophet and all that is great that's all of our identity but nonetheless there's still something I am the very life of [Applause] God and that's the very thing that all of us need and the reason why I was lost the reason why I felt like I wanted to die was because the church wasn't sufficient enough for me the church is okay she fulfills a certain part but nonetheless you will never take the place of the Holy [Applause] Ghost she will never take the place of a personal experience with the Living God and that's the very thing that all of us need this day when I was a child I read in the Bible but nonetheless those that are here will not hinder those that have gone on more than 40 years had to passed by for me to be able to understand that as long as I didn't surrender myself I'm just a hindrance for all of those that are sleeping those that are resting in Christ Jesus want to raise up and the reason why they can't do it because of the reason that we don't surrender ourselves we're now hindering the coming of the Lord because the same Lord coming with a shout voice of Archangel we're all waiting for that second part of that second mysterious descent but there has to be an alignment done we have to understand that we're the main characters in this play how many of you are understanding me forgive me for my voice my wife I wish you had a much softer voice some couple years ago Phoenix I was in Phoenix and I met with a man that had knowledge about the word and he came to visit me in the place where I was staying at and he came with his wife and then all of a sudden he told me brother scari I present unto you my cross and the sister didn't stay quiet and she said brother scar Roi I present unto you also my [Music] cross and that scarred my mind and my heart for many years and it came unto my mind that how many times we said that our wife is our cross my children are my cross the problems the issues are my cross my children are not my cross they are the greatest thing that's ever happened to me my wife is not my cross is my wife is my better half the trials They're Not My Cross brother Bram says that when a man loves God he sends them a trial so then trials are just nothing but a demonstration of God's love because it's through those trials that that man of God that's within us is going to get perfected God didn't die for him he died for the one that lives inside and nobody ever saw him the one that's out here is not it's just the house that lives in but all the sacrifices I make because of this but nonetheless this is not me and I've come to realize she says where has that young man that I fell in love gone to and I look at myself in the mirror and I can't deny but the one that lives inside of me was made at the very image of God it's a piece of God the image of God and he looks like God so then what's our cross because if we love him then we're going to follow him but we have to take up our cross and I can't take your cross and each and every one of us has our own made cross and your cross will never be my cross and my cross will never be your cross my cross is not my wife neither is it my children neither is it my trials my my cross is not the uh slip ups and mistakes what is my cross then Lord when Jesus came to Earth he had already known very clearly what his role was going to be here he didn't come with a forgetful mind like you and me he said father glorify me with the glory that we had before and it's still taking me some time that I was in the thoughts of God I didn't know that I thought that I had started at the moment of conception and now we understand that our very beginning was at the mind of God so then what's your cross brother scavi stop beating the bush our cross my cross is our responsibilities each and every one of us has come to this Earth with a responsibility and nobody will be able to do the job that I have to do and nobody will be able to do the job that you are and when I say this I don't only refer myself to the ministry I don't refer myself only to the ministers because at the end of the day we're all preacher the woman preaches without words Peter said can you preach without saying any words and then the greatest message that ever was preached wasn't of words our own lives has to be a preaching we're written Epistles read of all man I Am The Gospel According to St and for the love of God please don't misinterpret I'm not here so that you can think that I'm holy even though I am I wish that everybody would think the same we can't be holy without the Holy One we can't be Christians without Christ does not make us a [Applause] Christian being the children of the pastor doesn't make us being his friend or relative doesn't to be a Christian we need the Life of Christ to be within us that's the reason why I felt so empty inside all alone and and it was because of the absence of God within my own heart and I was a deacon for many years being a deacon is something good but the greatest thing that could ever happen to us is that God's own life rest within us a brother once told me why is it that brother Branham always [Applause] says if God ever gives a holy ghost to a man he will never let him I believe in the order and God is a god of order God placed in order and God doesn't like disorder but when God gives us his life he gives it unto us so that his Works may continue on Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever and we have seen the life of of Jesus Christ being replicated in the life of brother brandham but God is not a god of History he's not only a god of the future he is a god of the present he is not sleeping he's not dead he's [Applause] alive but we have them incarcerated like I [Applause] did I imprisoned the Lord Jesus Through the last 25 years can you imagine the saddest thing that I ever saw brother Bram said once and prisoned Eagle it was the saddest thing because God had given the Eagle wings to so that he could fly and since we all create our own cage we start to fill ourselves with limitation but this message brings back that sight that we once lost taking off that Veil what is taking off that Veil it's to open our eyes we need that our eyes to be open and and I'm not speaking about our physical eyes because these eyes are pointed outward they cannot see on the inside then now we have a need to be able to see with some different kind of eyes when I see the word of the Lord I don't see it nobody I see myself in there because the word of God is a [Applause] mirror so then when I ask myself then who's that fault and answer my own self based upon what brother Branham has said that at fault the ones that are standing behind the pulpit and I'm not here as a saint I am here as a preacher of the gospel and I've come to realize that I have not surrendered myself enough I've realized that I've come to relax myself and get comfortable so then I say unto the Lord help me my mother always told me you have to die so That Others May Live you have to die but who loves to die nobody wants to die but that's the origins of you have to die to be able to live my cross our cross are not our problems it's not our daily pressures that we live and it's not our limitations and it's not our differences our cross is the responsibility in which we were all born to do and brother Branham says that God didn't send us to be able to build great buildings God didn't send us to build great churches and all of that has its place it fulfills its purpose but he sent us onto Earth to be a this message throughout through the whole world and when I speak about the gospel obviously I do not refer myself only to the Bible I refer to my uh to the good [Applause] news I tell the people that I don't like the newspaper from yesterday I want fresh news not only shall Man live by bread but by every word that comes out of the mouth of God and that's the difference in between us and the denominational they eat of the bread they carry the same Bible they study the same Bible but the word of the Lord still says not only of bread not only of the Bible and it may sound a little off but it's not but also of every word that comes out of the mouth of God and God has a mouth the mouthpiece for our day Willam is William Mar brandham that's the name of the messenger of the day and US me we're only an echo of that voice I'm not looking for an eighth me God only has seven [Applause] eyes and I'm very grateful to be born in the days of this messenger so then what's our responsibility and I tell my wife I promised her that over there in glory I pr not I'll live for you and you will live for me and I look at my children and I've seen that I've made myself and deprived of seeing them grow up one day I came into my home and I opened the door without anybody knowing and I went into my room to surprise my wife and then all of a sudden I found a man sleeping next to her and I almost lost my mind and when I removed the bed sheet I saw that it was my older son and I had noticed that he had grown that's why every time that I can I give them love I a deep morning within for missing them and I thank God for the wife and kids that I have and I thank the Lord for the church that I attend for them to be able to share me with all of you and I always knew this what I wanted was a happy place to live in happy children a church to go to somewhere to have find Refuge where to go and heal the the wounds that the life brings them where to find the answers to the questions that I have where they can treat me well where they make me feel good I didn't know that God had called me to serve him to tell my brothers that Christ lives he has not died and in the same works that he did he is willing to do them again if we're willing to believe I don't have any doubts I divorced myself from them I know that Wherever I Go the signs will follow me I'm not here so that you can think something if you are children of God wherever you go the signs will follow you I know that wherever I go the power of Resurrection follows me forgiveness the grace the mercies the Divine Healing I believe in that but I'm not only speaking of myself I'm speaking of every child every son and daughter of God we are the very representation of the Lord Jesus Christ here on Earth here on Earth you are God's representation and one day I found myself and one Sunday like this someone began speaking in tongues onto me and one interpreting for God so loved this city he has Sosi so that everyone that believes in Him should not die but have everlasting life I almost pulled out all my hairs and I said this is the this is uh treason heresy but then I began to meditate and then I began to meditate in that each and every one of us is the very mercy of God for our we're the grace for our own family members we're the very Grace of those who have not heard the word of the Lord and while I'm speaking thousands and thousands of people are dying without ever having the opportunity to be able to hear the name of the Lord Jesus Christ so then when I ask myself then who's at fault for the darkness to grow then I look at myself and I realize that I have not done enough I realize that I have not preached enough and I realize that I have not surrendered myself oh Brothers we need to wake up realize the reason why God has sent us onto this Earth We're All ambassadors of Jesus Christ a prisoner of Jesus J Christ because of each and every one of you that's who we are my mother so if women were allowed to preach I would be quiet forever I would mute myself and sit down at her feet to learn from her when I went to the airport she told me everything will be [Applause] okay I will be on my knees leading unto God that he may Prosper your ways my mother is a missionary but she doesn't go out to but she is a missionary there's many ways of being able to now the missionary field is growing and the whole world is growing in hunger and the complete world is dying for an ounce of love and now I'm ashamed to be able to say or that my name is because that's our name I told the young man in the morning when I was 16 I went walking into my house about 8 kilm I didn't have money to be able to say like you say over here to pay the I was walking I was looking down at the ground and hoping that I would find a Coin to be able to buy something from H and then all of a sudden I find a little pamphlet and it said I live in a dark country where Darkness thrives and in the thrives a shame the shame misery and in the misery a hand willing and to put forth their work to bring forth light to this dark country and I've haven't been able to forget about it after 40 years and it keeps beating within my heart because Jesus said I am the light of the world and while I'm in the world I am the light of the world but knowing that the his hour was coming night he looked onto his disciples and he said you are the light of this world if the world is in darkness shall it be Lord should should it be that I don't and what good is the light if I hide it the light is not so that you can hide it the light is so that you can show up brothers and sisters the world is dying slowly for just a little bit of light for a little bit of love where is that love the love is hidden but let's wake it up stop wake up you who sleeps and Christ shall Enlighten you and this message that we have received is the same message that Jesus Christ preached it's the same message that the apostles preach it's the same message why the Apostle Paul gave his life the same message and this is a message of restoration it has the power to be able to bring us back to bring us back to the father and what was in that heart love love love for one another the missionary work involves love you can't support the missionary you need love a missionary heart is a the heart of a love for lost souls and brother Bram says it is very unjust to comb somebody two times and I'm already comb myself and I continue brother scari you're already combed it's so unjust to preach somebody the gospel two times and that breaks my heart so then I find out that we have a responsibility with our own because those who don't provide for their own home is wor but we have a responsibility for those that don't know you are the light of those three crosses you are the light of Las Cruses you are the light to the United States we are the light to the entire world and I'm not saying that everybody has to believe because the message has always been there it's been preached on to the great multitudes but it's for oh little flock you're not afraid for the it is God's will but we have to preach it to everybody so that nobody can be able to say that it's because of you that I never heard because of you I am lost if we can hear the voice of those that are asleep if we can hear the screaming and the shouting of all those that have gone on to the we have the Hope every day that I open up my eyes it's a miracle a miracle of life and it's the time to be able to get right with God it's the opportunity to be able to get right with our it's the opportunity to be able to say or to our wives forgive it's the time to be able to forgive and it's the opportunity to go worldwide and I'm not speaking about a dream or an illusion speaking about the cross that the Lord has called us and told us to carry the cross of Jesus was to die for the world completely that was the cross of Jesus to be able to purchase back that property that was be able to reclaim that which Adam had lost if you and I can be able to say that we're saved was because Jesus didn't never gave his back to his responsibility and he knew that he had a cross to be and just like him that he was given a cross each and every one of you as well Brothers constantly I I uh afflict myself I have a lot of things that I'm ashamed of if there was a time machine I would go and buy it to be able to prepare my mistakes to correct all of the wrongdoings mission if I would be able to go back to [Applause] 1980 the year that I found that pamphlet of Revelations 10:7 I would go back and dedicate my life to that very moment God didn't only call the elderly or the older people or the god also called the young people I didn't know that God had called me to be able to work in his kingdom I was so worried about finding uh Financial stability I was so worried in being able to build up a name for myself I didn't know that he had called me he had to tell me face to face one day that's the reason why I sent you to Earth for you to be a construction I've been a Mason worker for 25 years of my life and I still am the smell of of Steel I love smell of cement and when I walk into a building I can't do none less see how building is built I love the foundation I love the pillars and Foundations and I know that the most important part of this whole building are not the walls or the ceiling it's the foundation but the foundation you can't see it because it's hidden one time my teacher once told me I I hope that the Lord May one day allow you to be go deep and I told him of course I am uh we can speak a little bit about the return we can talk about a little bit of uh shot we can talk a little bit about the the tent I am very profound and my teacher once told me and what I told you that being deep is to go deep is down what do you want to look down for who wants to see the foundation who wants to do the first works we don't want to do the first works we only want the big to be able to construct our own name to build our own church but we need to look down the structure of this building this home rests upon two built upon the and Jesus Christ being the Chief Cornerstone we have to go back to the foundation Jesus told to all those that that knew the law but in the beginning it wasn't so it wasn't like that in the foundation we have to go back to the beginning this message brings us back to go and preach the gospel to every living creature and these signs shall follow them that in my name they shall cast out shall speak with new tongues shall raise the dead I have seen nobody has ever I have seen it with my own eyes I've seen a dead course in the name a God that we serve is not a god of History I believe in the history our history is our memory but Jesus Christ is the same from yesterday tomorrow but he's also the same today the only thing that we have need of is to believe who has believed our report oh brother let's go on reporting the Gospel of Jesus Christ but then we find ourselves with the roadblock of unb but the unbelief doesn't hinder God God is the same he multiplies the bread heals the sick he opens the eyes to the blind he makes the the lame walk and that's the God that I preach and the God that I present unto you this morning give an Applause to that God this morning blessed be the name of the Lord Jesus [Applause] Christ but why is it that Darkness has magnified brother Fabio said yesterday the message is the Fountain of our inspiration I love him but I don't have to hear him to be to inspire myself our inspiration comes solely from this message and in this message we find Little Golden nuggets oh how I love those little golden nuggets gold is deity and brother bam says that sin has grown because we have not we have not forfeited our own thoughts we haven't forfeited our own works and we have not denied our own selves and the only way that the that hell will because the Bible says that the Gates of Hell shall not Prevail against it amen it's that we must love one another it's that we must not only preach about the cross but we must what good is the cross if we don't get on it what good is it to be a sheep if we don't die Peter had found a sheep you're the Lamb of God that takes away the sin of the world that no let nobody touch him don't let nobody do any harm and when he found out that the land was going to Jerusalem no you're I'm not letting you pass I will not let you you are my lamb I will not let anything happen to you get behind me Satan Peter had not understand yet that not only did a lamb was a lamb but also that the lamb must die because if it did not die we would all be completely lost oh and how do we thank God for that sacrifice of the Lamb nonetheless the scriptures have a double or double meaning and just the same as the Lamb of God died we also the lamb must die and the Sheep of raise if you don't raise your hand you're not a lamb what good is if it does not die now I understand my mother my mom once told me stop stop getting so desperate stop looking at the process die for them so that the just die for me I'll die for them but that's what it's all about to die for my children to die for my wife to die for my family to die for my friends to die for the congregation because if the lamb doesn't die it would be no of good use but who wants to die nobody wants to die we all want to live Jesus said if the wheat doesn't fall to the ground and die you cannot bring forth life brothers and sisters I love you in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ I feel privileged and honored be able to stand behind this pulit where great men have stood and who am I I'm just an usher in which God has permitted to preach love one another up to the point that you would die voluntarily so that someone else may live I die in every breath in every breath in every word that comes out of my mouth I'm dying so that someone else may live if we stop preaching how will believe the Bible says if there's no one to preach him and how are they going to preach if there's nobody to send this is our mission this is our [Applause] homework this is the Great Commission that the Lord Jesus Christ handed over to his church and us we are a part of that church the the body of Believers that are s cannot be perfect without us and what are we the love because love perfects the building you would mind standing the reason why I felt so sad we read and worn out the reason why I felt that my life didn't have any more purpose it was because I had not understood that my heart belongs to God but I surrendered my heart to my wife I gave it unto my children to my mother and my brothers and I didn't realize that my heart belongs but not only my heart you shall love God with all your mind you shall love God with all of your strength you shall love God with all of your heart is there somebody here this morning that wants to surrender their mind onto is there somebody here this morning that would like to surrender their strength to the Lord is there somebody that would like to surrender their heart a man once told me overi God needs your voice God needs your arms God needs your feet I didn't know or realize that the great powerful God needed me I didn't know that the Great and Mighty powerful God needed all of us how many of you would like to surrender yourselves once again how many of you want to renew your vows I renew my wife my vows with my wife day every day I tell her that I and every day she tells me and every day we shall renew ours with our Lord the Lord only wants us he is a a zealous he doesn't sh share his glory my glory is my wife and the glory of God is his and he wants his bride all to himself raise your hands bow your heads and if somebody feels a tug in their heart come the altar is open Heavenly
