[32:14] we won't keep you very long right now
[32:17] we had ourselves a great time in the
[32:19] lord last night
[32:22] but this is the promise of the lord
[32:24] jesus
[32:27] this is christ the book of psalms
[32:30] and and and here david
[32:32] david is receiving the great inspiration
[32:36] receiving the grand inspiration what
[32:38] would happen hundreds and hundreds of
[32:40] years later
[33:08] whosoever
[33:22] there was a man that claimed to be god's
[33:24] own son
[33:27] he was not one of god's son
[33:30] he was the only begotten name
[33:34] and i want you to know
[33:36] that he died on friday
[33:38] today is saturday oh yes
[33:40] he was buried on and he was entombed
[33:47] the scripture
[33:49] is what kept him in the grave
[33:52] there was nothing else that could keep
[33:54] him in the graveyard
[34:02] he was crucified on friday
[34:45] but there was others that were there
[34:49] that were waiting
[34:51] until
[34:52] the blood of bulls and goats
[34:55] would be done away
[34:58] from the blood of god himself
[35:28] i
[35:41] and when the scripture turned him loose
[35:45] this was the first time
[35:48] from when he was the worst
[35:51] he was actually free yeah
[35:54] because he was the eternal one
[36:09] but i will not leave my holy
[36:24] he overcame
[36:37] supplications
[36:39] [Music]
[36:44] to him
[36:46] i was able to save him from death
[36:50] and it was heard that he feared
[37:19] whatever you're going through
[37:50] you might be looking at a time of your
[37:52] life
[37:54] where it seems like all is lost
[37:59] but let me tell you the comment is the
[38:01] word of god still has the answer
[38:14] far away
[38:42] started going into the places the
[38:45] regions
[38:48] and when satan thought he had him
[38:53] when satan thought he had it
[38:56] i'm gonna tell you again
[39:25] he was buried in a borrowed tomb
[39:30] many people say he was very poor
[39:34] yes he was very poor
[39:37] but why would he have to brother mike
