[18:34] in the bonds
[19:10] let us borrow heads in prayer
[19:14] our gracious heavenly father
[19:18] we are happy to be called your children
[19:20] this afternoon lord
[19:22] and as your children have come lord
[19:25] i pray that you have a special anointing
[19:28] upon them
[19:29] upon the congregation
[19:32] on those that have will be seen this
[19:35] ceremony today
[19:36] may your hand of grace and mercy apply
[19:39] abide upon them
[19:41] and upon this congregation
[19:44] in the name of the lord jesus christ we
[19:46] pray
[19:47] amen and amen you may be seated
[19:59] for the next few moments we
[20:02] we're going to take a portion of
[20:03] scripture
[20:06] it
[20:07] might be
[20:10] to the average person
[20:12] that
[20:13] as we go to many weddings
[20:16] might be out of character
[20:20] the scripture tells us in ephesians the
[20:23] second chapter
[20:24] and the verse eight
[20:26] it says for by grace are ye saved
[20:30] through faith
[20:32] and that not of yourselves
[20:35] it is the gift of god
[20:38] the book of proverbs tells us
[20:41] who can find a virtuous
[20:43] woman
[20:45] for her price is far
[20:47] above rubies
[20:49] and in the book of saint john the fourth
[20:51] chapter
[20:52] and the tenth verse it says
[20:55] jesus answered and said unto her
[20:58] if thou knewest the gift of god
[21:01] and who it is
[21:02] that saith to thee
[21:04] give me to drink
[21:06] thou would have asked of him
[21:08] and he would have given thee living
[21:10] water
[21:13] i
[21:15] come to the marriage as we will
[21:17] celebrate here in a in a few minutes the
[21:20] oath the
[21:21] the bonds
[21:23] of what will unite
[21:26] these two together
[21:28] understanding that
[21:31] that it is their
[21:33] vow to each other that already has tied
[21:35] them to each other
[21:38] when he
[21:39] when gabriel asked
[21:41] mari
[21:43] and she said yes
[21:45] they were as good as married in the eyes
[21:47] of the lord
[21:51] you look awfully handsome today
[21:56] dress up real well
[21:58] very beautiful today
[22:01] known these young people for
[22:04] quite a while
[22:06] this is what we do
[22:09] as a body of believers
[22:12] we we don't believe in dating
[22:16] we court
[22:18] we don't do it according to the world
[22:21] we do it according to the commandments
[22:23] of almighty god
[22:25] or this
[22:26] that we will enter into in a few minute
[22:28] minutes
[22:30] is sacred
[22:32] it is something
[22:33] not to be
[22:34] entered in
[22:36] haphazardly
[22:37] but it's something that we do believe
[22:39] that it is until death do we part
[22:43] it is something that god has ordained
[22:46] since the garden of eden
[22:48] the bible says that from the beginning
[22:51] of the creation of god
[22:53] god made them male and female
[22:57] in today's society that is frowned upon
[23:02] we don't care what happens
[23:04] and what society has to tell
[23:06] we have entered into another kingdom
[23:10] and in that kingdom its male and female
[23:13] created he them
[23:16] the scripture tells us
[23:18] for this cause shall a man
[23:20] leave his father and mother
[23:23] and cleave to his wife
[23:25] and they twain shall be
[23:27] one flesh
[23:29] so then they are no more twain
[23:32] but one flesh
[23:35] what therefore god hath joined together
[23:39] let not man put asunder
[23:42] god's motive then
[23:44] for marriage is for the two to become
[23:47] one flesh
[23:49] because two
[23:50] is better than one
[23:53] deuteronomy the 32nd chapter
[23:56] tells us
[23:57] says that one
[23:59] can chase a thousand
[24:01] but two can put 10 000 to flight
[24:05] this is what god has instituted in his
[24:09] word
[24:11] says if two of you
[24:14] shall agree
[24:15] on any on earth as touching anything
[24:19] that they ask
[24:21] it shall be done for them of my father
[24:24] which is in heaven
[24:26] the only way that these two
[24:28] can become one
[24:30] if this god is in the middle of that
[24:33] relationship
[24:35] that's why he says
[24:37] he he tells us where there are two or
[24:39] three congregated in my name
[24:42] there i am in the midst of them
[24:46] says if one prevail against him
[24:49] two shall withstand him and a threefold
[24:52] cord is not quickly
[24:55] broken
[24:57] the beginning of the creation of god
[25:00] how god has instituted since the garden
[25:03] of eden
[25:05] i
[25:06] look at our in our situation and around
[25:08] the world
[25:10] of what things that are transpiring in
[25:13] the political realm in the religious
[25:14] realm in the secular realm
[25:17] and to many people this is an odd
[25:20] occurrence today
[25:22] but in the eyes of god this is the way
[25:24] that it is supposed to happen
[25:27] the bible speaks to us
[25:30] about different things of what we are
[25:33] supposed to be doing today
[25:35] but i want to to
[25:37] to let everyone know this afternoon
[25:42] that we believe that god sent a mighty
[25:44] prophet
[25:47] i'm going to say this again
[25:49] we're going to we believe that god sent
[25:51] a mighty prophet in this 20th century
[25:55] and it was to take us back to eden it
[25:57] was to take us back to understand that
[26:00] from the beginning even though what
[26:02] might happen today but from the
[26:04] beginning it was not so
[26:07] in understanding all of these these
[26:10] these things
[26:11] then in a few minutes there's going to
[26:13] be an oath taken
[26:15] this is not until i find another one
[26:22] this is not until something else feels
[26:24] better
[26:27] this is until
[26:28] death
[26:30] part
[26:31] that's an oath
[26:34] there cannot be no covenant unless there
[26:37] is a no
[26:40] me and my wife by
[26:42] god's
[26:44] amazing grace have this year will
[26:46] celebrate 38 years together
[26:50] i remember a great man of god that
[26:52] always told us to make sure
[26:55] that she stayed
[26:57] my girlfriend
[27:00] as a wife you
[27:02] kind of
[27:03] things start going and
[27:06] see how beautiful she is today
[27:11] you see how handsome he is today
[27:14] it won't always be this way
[27:19] she's going to disappoint you
[27:22] you're going to disappoint him
[27:29] but in all of that the bible says that
[27:31] love covers
[27:33] a multitude of sins
[27:36] i remember when my papa looked down in
[27:38] time and he says there is a girl for you
[27:41] and she's from albuquerque
[27:43] i said dada you know
[27:46] i i you know you have your excuses
[27:49] of why he said
[27:51] pay attention
[27:54] there are things that have to happen in
[27:56] life for people to pay attention when
[27:58] you look upon the time and this is not
[28:01] just the time that we're gonna have a
[28:03] wedding and have a have a a a dinner and
[28:06] then all of a sudden there's a honeymoon
[28:08] and everything goes out the window
[28:11] this is a great event
[28:14] outside of your salvation
[28:17] gabe this is the greatest day of your
[28:20] whole life
[28:22] outside of your salvation this is the
[28:25] greatest day of your whole life
[28:27] this is the great decision
[28:29] of what god is doing and what he's doing
[28:32] today this afternoon this is what he's
[28:34] trying to do with his people amen
[28:38] when all of this that we're looking in
[28:40] for a few more minutes
[28:42] i made that decision when i made that
[28:44] decision outside of my salvation become
[28:48] the greatest decision that i've ever
[28:50] made
[28:51] but
[28:52] you're going to have to find her gift
[28:56] if there's any scripture that identifies
[28:58] the prophet of the age was jesus and the
[29:01] woman at the well
[29:03] yes
[29:04] and when jesus meets the woman at the
[29:06] well
[29:07] he tells her this if thou knewest the
[29:10] gift
[29:11] and who it is that speaks to you
[29:14] you would ask of him living waters now
[29:18] you're gonna have to find
[29:19] the gift here
[29:21] you're gonna have to find the gift there
[29:24] because by grace are we saved
[29:27] and that not of ourselves it is the gift
[29:30] of god but under the gift there are
[29:33] gifts
[29:34] and this is a gift
[29:37] so you're going to have to find
[29:39] you might not find it today
[29:41] might be 38 years
[29:43] when you find that virtuous woman
[29:46] her price is far above that than rupees
[29:50] yes the hebrew word
[29:53] for
[29:55] for oath is shiva
[29:58] meaning to seven one cell
[30:02] abraham makes the treaty with abimelech
[30:05] using seven you lambs
[30:08] and they call the place
[30:11] beersheba
[30:13] which means the place of the oath
[30:16] or the well of the sevens
[30:21] if you don't have an oath
[30:23] you have no covenant
[30:26] another word for oath is you raise your
[30:28] hand
[30:30] and how many in church do we when we're
[30:32] worshiping the lord and the minister or
[30:35] someone tells you raise up your hand
[30:37] what you are actually signifying is that
[30:40] i make an oath to almighty god
[30:42] we raise our hands in worship we are
[30:45] swearing an oath to him
[30:47] there ain't no god like our god
[30:51] there's no one that can bring two people
[30:53] from two separate mind thing
[30:56] thinkings
[30:57] two different concepts two different
[31:00] ideas and bring them together and the
[31:02] twain become one like god can
[31:06] a religion can give you a creed or a
[31:08] dogma
[31:12] but he gives you a relationship
[31:17] making it in all oath then
[31:20] is to call upon the power of god
[31:24] to bind satan and evil
[31:26] it is a mystery
[31:29] of drawing down the presence of god
[31:32] of engaging god for help in power
[31:37] to do whatever
[31:39] we're
[31:40] about to do
[31:42] so
[31:46] okay
[31:47] i was young one
[31:50] got gray hair now
[31:54] i was where you were at one time
[31:58] but in the name of the lord jesus christ
[32:00] find her price
[32:02] find the gift
[32:04] find him his gift
[32:07] for by grace we are saved
[32:10] and that not of ourselves
[32:13] it is the gift
[32:14] of god god bless you
[32:16] [Applause]
[32:34] amen god bless you god bless each one of
[32:36] you that have come
[32:38] to
[32:40] be here as witnesses of this great event

[33:29] ready
[33:40] dearly beloved
[33:42] we are gathered here together in the
[33:44] sight of god
[33:46] and in the face of this company
[33:49] to join together this man and woman in
[33:52] holy matrimony
[33:54] which is commanded by saint paul to be
[33:56] honorable among all men
[33:58] it is therefore not by any to be entered
[34:00] into
[34:01] unadvisably
[34:03] or lightly
[34:05] irreverently
[34:06] discreetly
[34:08] soberly
[34:10] and in the fear of god
[34:12] into this holy state these two persons
[34:15] present come to be joined

[34:20] just cause why they should not be

[34:27] or from hereafter forever hold your
[34:29] peace

[34:42] then you must hold your peace
[34:44] i will require and charge you both as
[34:46] you'll surely answer at the day of
[34:48] judgment
[34:49] when the secrets of all hearts shall be
[34:51] disclosed
[34:52] if there's either of you that know any
[34:55] impediment why you should not be
[34:56] lawfully joined together in this holy
[34:59] matrimony
[35:00] do you now confess it
[35:02] or be it assured unto you that any
[35:04] couples that are joined otherwise then
[35:06] god's word does allow
[35:08] their marriage
[35:09] is not lawful
