[33:34] sermon and I'm going to title it
[33:38] unfinished
[33:41] sermons just five more
[33:45] minutes right so it kind of reminded me
[33:47] of a time that brother Anthony and
[33:51] I we were we were
[33:53] hunting and we saw some deer on the side
[33:55] of a hill
[33:59] and so we get down we put our glasses
[34:02] on and we range the
[34:05] deer he says it's 550
[34:08] yards I get on the
[34:10] rifle and I'm like oh I can take that
[34:13] shot in my
[34:15] sleep so we're waiting for this deer to
[34:18] come he's got his head in the
[34:21] trees and uh I'm on there
[34:24] waiting just waiting and waiting
[34:27] he's
[34:29] eating and the light Fades
[34:32] away and I turned to brother
[34:35] Anthony right and as the light's
[34:39] done uh he lifts his head
[34:42] up and he was one of those deer that you
[34:44] you dream about
[34:47] right but I I wasn't going to shoot
[34:50] him and brother Anthony looks at
[34:53] me he says this is from now on called
[34:56] two minute
[35:01] Hill cuz we just needed two more
[35:06] minutes now how many remembers the story
[35:09] that I told
[35:11] you about God did it
[35:14] amen you all remember it it was about a
[35:17] widow lady who she uh had ran out of
[35:22] food she was praying every day for
[35:25] food just to rec real quick and and so
[35:28] she she starts to pray and her neighbor
[35:30] was an
[35:33] atheist and uh he overheard her praying
[35:35] you know she had her window
[35:38] open and so he says oh there I'm going
[35:41] to show her who God
[35:43] is y all remember the story and so he he
[35:47] uh comes and he puts uh food on her on
[35:49] her on her
[35:52] porch and she opens up the porch one day
[35:55] door and she says Oh Glory to
[35:59] God God did it right and so the guy
[36:03] comes over and he's like what are you so
[36:04] happy
[36:06] about you know he was one of those
[36:08] negative kind of people you know
[36:10] like kind of reminds me of me
[36:14] sometimes oh that's never going to work
[36:18] out what you so happy about he said I
[36:22] had no food and I prayed to God and he
[36:23] answered my
[36:25] prayer said no no I uh I put the food
[36:31] there no God did it right and so he said
[36:35] no no no you're not
[36:37] understanding there there's no such
[36:39] thing as
[36:41] God you had a
[36:44] need and I provided for
[36:46] you no God did
[36:49] it he started getting
[36:52] angry and uh so he says uh no no I did
[36:55] it no
[36:57] she said no let let me make something
[36:58] straight
[37:01] here God did it and he made the devil
[37:04] pay for
[37:06] it right so I want you to know
[37:10] tonight that God can do
[37:13] it how many knows that God is able to do
[37:17] it how many knows that whatever your
[37:19] circumstance is

[37:26] eyes
[37:28] and you can tell him God did
[37:31] it I'm here
[37:33] today in
[37:36] 2024 because God did it it was God who
[37:40] did it the reason I can move around
[37:44] today is because God did
[37:47] it and I believe
[37:49] tonight that God still can do it
[37:53] amen now am now let me let me let me
[37:58] give a little
[37:59] disclosure it's not going to be
[38:02] easy that's right
[38:05] right it's not going to be that
[38:08] easy but uh let's let's finish our
[38:11] scripture
[38:12] here right and it says uh
[38:15] David as the heart panteth after the
[38:17] water Brook so panteth my soul after
[38:19] thee Oh
[38:24] God my soul thirst is for God for the
[38:27] Living God When shall I come and appear
[38:29] before
[38:34] God my tears have been my meat day and
[38:38] night while they continually say unto me
[38:41] where is thy
[38:47] God when I remember these things I pour
[38:49] out my soul in me for I have gone for I
[38:52] had gone with the multitudes I went with
[38:54] them to the house of God with the voice
[38:57] of joy and praise with a multitude that
[39:00] kept holy
[39:04] [Music]
[39:14] day why are thou cast down oh my soul
[39:17] and why are thou disquieted in me hope
[39:21] thou in God for I shall yet praise him
[39:25] for the of his
[39:35] countenance oh my God my soul is cast
[39:37] down Within Me therefore will I remember
[39:40] thee from the land of Jordan and to the
[39:43] harmonites from the hill of the
[39:55] misar calleth unto the Deep at the noise
[39:58] of thy water spouts all thy waves and
[40:00] thy Billows are gone over
[40:07] me yet the Lord will command his loving
[40:10] kindness in the daytime and in the night
[40:12] his song shall be with me and my prayer
[40:15] unto God of my
[40:25] life I will say unto God my rock why
[40:28] hast thou forgotten me why go I mourning
[40:31] because of the oppression of my
[40:40] enemies as with a sword in my bones my
[40:42] enemies in my bones my enemies approach
[40:45] me while they say daily unto me where is
[40:48] thy
[40:54] God why are thou cast down oh my soul
[40:57] and why are thou
[40:58] dis disqui within
[41:06] me hope thou in God for I shall yet
[41:09] praise him who is the health of my
[41:11] countenance and my
[41:16] God and so we see here David is in
[41:21] distress brother Bram
[41:24] says as he reads this scripture
[41:27] he says I think
[41:30] David in the writing of this Psalm must
[41:32] have been been in
[41:39] [Music]
[41:41] distress and it usually takes distress
[41:44] to bring the best out of a
[41:48] man it really that's when God gets down
[41:51] to when we fast many
[41:55] times
[41:57] to get ourselves in
[42:02] position we got to get ourselves in
[42:07] position it's it's time that we change
[42:11] positions right like a football
[42:14] game when you're on you're on
[42:17] defense you're you're defending all the
[42:20] time you don't know what the enemy is
[42:22] going to
[42:24] do but it's time that we change
[42:28] positions and now it's time for us to go
[42:30] on
[42:32] offense now we got to get the
[42:35] devil we got to confuse him
[42:38] now it's time for us to change the
[42:42] place now he's got to worry about what
[42:44] we're going to
[42:47] do we're always worried about what he's
[42:49] going to
[42:51] do but to get ourselves in
[42:54] position to get ourselves out of the
[42:58] way and I think when David got in this
[43:02] place then he began to meditate on the
[43:06] Lord began to think about the
[43:10] things many times God gets us into tight
[43:15] Corners where we have to look
[43:20] up sometimes we even have to get on our
[43:22] back in the hospital or a bed
[43:25] somewhere
[43:27] so we can look up to see where the
[43:29] blessings of God come
[43:31] [Music]
[43:33] from now keep in mind through throughout
[43:35] the
[43:38] message images of
[43:41] Christ
[43:43] right what's our purpose
[43:47] here talk to yourself
[43:50] tonight right and and ask
[43:52] yourself what what's our purpose
[43:55] here
[43:56] why why are we
[43:58] here are we here to to advance ourselves
[44:02] in in in our
[44:06] careers are we here to uh maybe make a
[44:09] lot of
[44:11] money live in a comfortable
[44:14] home go out and eat every
[44:18] weekend go out on
[44:21] vacation right those things are fine
[44:24] right is that our purpose is for being
[44:29] here or is it to
[44:32] be is it to be an image of
[44:36] Christ right now with a show of
[44:41] hands how many wants to be an image of
[44:47] Christ how many Christians do we have
[44:51] tonight we got about
[44:53] majority so for the ones that didn't
[44:55] raise your hand
[44:56] hands uh how many would want to be a
[45:02] Christian wow so we got some that rais
[45:06] their hands they they're
[45:08] Christians there was some that didn't
[45:10] raise their hands because they weren't
[45:12] Christians and then the question is
[45:14] asked how many wants to be a
[45:17] Christian and no more
[45:19] hands I'll give you another
[45:21] opportunity how many Christians do we
[45:23] have
[45:24] tonight okay better now what is a
[45:30] Christian somebody answer me what what
[45:33] what is a
[45:34] Christian to be Christlike
[45:37] amen okay
[45:41] therefore uh so many times we hear the
[45:47] expression oh what is a Christ what is a
[45:51] Christian some people limit it to
[45:53] joining a
[45:54] church
[45:57] someone said well a Christian is a
[45:59] church
[46:02] member someone who takes up their
[46:05] afflictions with the church affiliations
[46:07] with the
[46:08] church I believe that all Christians
[46:10] should do
[46:12] that but I don't believe that that's
[46:16] Christianity that's what a Christian
[46:18] does after he becomes a
[46:21] Christian but I I don't
[46:24] mean or it doesn't
[46:26] mean that because he does it that he's a
[46:31] Christian then some
[46:33] say no it's going to church and serving
[46:36] a declaration of
[46:40] Creeds and being loyal to those things
[46:43] in which the church
[46:48] teaches and then there are others that
[46:51] say that
[46:53] perhaps packing a little something
[46:55] something on
[46:57] them a little Cross or
[47:00] something that that is a sign of a
[47:04] Christian well and then there's others
[47:07] who
[47:08] believe that perhaps
[47:11] maybe if they would burn a candle or do
[47:15] something some kind of penance that
[47:17] that's a
[47:19] Christian if they will merely merely be
[47:21] immersed in
[47:23] water or they will do some sacrif
[47:27] or give some good to the
[47:31] church or help the
[47:34] neighbor buy some coal for the
[47:38] Widow uh maybe buy some shoes for the
[47:42] orphan that's the acts that a Christian
[47:45] should
[47:47] do but that still doesn't make them a
[47:52] Christian and then some say that if you
[47:56] pack an image of
[47:58] Christ in your car or on your
[48:03] wall that is a sign of a
[48:06] Christian well them things are all
[48:09] right but I don't believe that packing
[48:12] an image makes you a
[48:15] Christian I believe that being an
[48:20] image of Christ makes you a
[48:24] Christian if it's not what you do
[48:28] outwardly outwardly it's what happened
[48:36] inwardly that makes us what we
[48:39] are then
[48:41] therefore if he is our
[48:44] image and we are in his
[48:48] likeness and members of his
[48:51] body we should be images like him
[48:56] then our lives should reflect the image
[48:59] of
[49:04] Christ not in joining a
[49:07] church or packing a
[49:10] crucifix or
[49:13] emotions but it should be the living
[49:18] presence of the Living
[49:20] God that
[49:22] reflects through your life
[49:26] so let me ask the question
[49:29] again how many Christians do we have
[49:31] here
[49:33] tonight right is his life are you an
[49:37] image or a reflection of his
[49:41] life to be
[49:44] Christlike
[49:46] now let me ask
[49:49] you do you want to be the image of
[49:54] Christ now now I want to read over in
[49:57] Mark
[49:59] 11
[50:01] right and it's going to be found in
[50:05] 11 verse
[50:14] 12 and it says and on the tomorrow when
[50:17] they were come from Bethany he was
[50:23] hungry and seen a fig tree from far off
[50:26] having
[50:29] leaves so this scripture kind of got me
[50:32] a little got me
[50:35] here so Jesus was
[50:38] hungry right we we've seen that scen
[50:41] before
[50:43] right when he was being tempted of the
[50:47] devil right Jesus was
[50:50] hungry and in the passion
[50:52] version it's it's something great when
[50:55] when Satan comes to
[50:57] Jesus and and he this is how I'm going
[51:00] to paraphrase it for you this is how it
[51:03] reads he comes to Jesus and he
[51:07] says how can you be the Son of
[51:11] God and be
[51:15] hungry right how many sons of God do we
[51:18] have
[51:19] here okay so he it's funny for
[51:23] us everything's impossible possible
[51:26] Right but for the devil he knows he
[51:30] comes to Jesus and he's kind of
[51:33] confused he says how can you be the Son
[51:36] of
[51:37] God and be hungry if you're hungry then
[51:42] turn these stones into
[51:44] bread it wasn't a big
[51:46] task it wasn't something that Satan was
[51:49] going oh he's the son of God he just
[51:50] turned no it was something
[51:54] common
[51:56] if you're hungry why don't you turn the
[51:57] stones to
[52:00] bread so then Jesus finds himself hungry
[52:02] here
[52:05] again and he sees a
[52:07] tree
[52:09] right and as he comes to this
[52:13] tree and I'm going to read it to you in
[52:15] this version and the next day as he left
[52:16] Bethany Jesus was feeling
[52:20] hungry he noticed a leafy fig tree or a
[52:24] man maybe I don't know it says a
[52:29] tree but we know that the Bible says
[52:32] that they were trees
[52:35] right type he men were like
[52:39] trees and he was
[52:41] hungry and I wonder how many times he's
[52:43] ever come to
[52:45] me and he was
[52:47] hungry right and he saw me from a far
[52:50] off and and he saw me and I was real
[52:54] leafy
[52:56] he he noticed a leafy fig tree in the
[52:59] distance so he walked over it there
[53:03] see if there was any fruit on
[53:06] it he wanted to see if he could see his
[53:09] reflection in that
[53:12] tree he wanted to see if he could see
[53:14] his
[53:16] image in that
[53:18] tree because for
[53:21] God nothing is
[53:24] impossible
[53:25] he could have easily gone to that
[53:29] tree walked up to it saw that there was
[53:33] no
[53:34] fruit just like in front of
[53:37] Satan he could have made the stones into
[53:41] bread but brother Brown said he wasn't a
[53:45] showof it wasn't his time yet to show
[53:48] his
[53:49] power right and he could have come to
[53:51] this
[53:53] tree and he could have easily
[53:55] said bear fruit I'm
[54:00] hungry seems to me like he
[54:04] could he noticed fig tree in the
[54:06] distance so he walked over to see if
[54:08] there was any fruit on
[54:11] it but there was
[54:13] none only
[54:15] religion it was only full of
[54:18] religion it had all the quotes on
[54:22] it it had every scripture on it
[54:26] it bought for the
[54:29] widows it did certain
[54:32] penances it did all these things that we
[54:34] just
[54:35] read but it wasn't a
[54:39] reflection it didn't have the Life of
[54:42] Christ now I'm talking about a
[54:45] tree and Jesus I'm going to read it back
[54:47] in the King James
[54:50] version and seen the feig tree a far off
[54:53] and came to it in verse vers 13 if
[55:02] happily if
[55:04] happily that's what it says in
[55:08] English right if happily he might find
[55:12] anything there
[55:14] on doesn't that sound like the Rich
[55:16] Young
[55:18] rulers right he came to the Rich Young
[55:20] the Rich Young Ruler came to
[55:22] him and he was sad
[55:25] because he loved him when he when he
[55:28] came to him he was probably
[55:31] happy and then he saw that there was no
[55:33] fruit
[55:35] there right so happily he wanted to take
[55:39] fruit but then there was no fruit
[55:44] there but he found nothing but
[55:47] leaves that he might find something
[55:49] there on and when he came to it he found
[55:50] nothing but
[55:53] leaves for the time of figs was not
[55:57] yet and Jesus
[56:02] answered that's
[56:05] strange answered
[56:09] what the verse before he just said he he
[56:12] was
[56:14] hungry he was hungry okay I'm hungry oh
[56:18] I see a tree oh there's no fruit
[56:22] there oh and then Jesus
[56:26] answered who who did he
[56:29] answer did he answer nobody asked him
[56:33] anything no nobody presented a question
[56:35] to
[56:36] him but Jesus answered and said unto
[56:41] it did the tree talk to
[56:45] him did the tree explain why no no there
[56:48] it's not the time of figs
[56:53] yet I I don't have no fruit right
[56:56] now you know it's not
[56:59] time and Jesus answered and said unto
[57:02] it no man eat fruit of thee Hereafter
[57:08] forever and his disciples heard
[57:12] it wow is that kind of
[57:16] strange and
[57:19] then and then the in verse
[57:23] 20 and in the
[57:26] morning as they passed by they saw the
[57:28] fig
[57:29] tree dried up from the
[57:33] roots and Peter calling to remembrance
[57:35] sayth unto
[57:38] him Master behold the Fig Tree which
[57:41] thou
[57:43] curses is withered
[57:46] away where in the scripture before
[57:50] that did it ever say that he cursed the
[57:53] tree
[57:59] it doesn't say that he cursed the
[58:02] tree it says that he went to the
[58:05] tree went to go get
[58:08] fruit it was covered in
[58:11] religion and he answered it
[58:15] saying no man eat fruit from thee
[58:19] anymore and the disciples heard
[58:23] it nowhere does it say that it was
[58:27] cursed just like in the Garden of
[58:30] Eden he never cursed the
[58:33] man but he cursed the
[58:36] ground the ground in which it was
[58:40] planted was cursed because it did not
[58:44] bear the
[58:46] image and that's why many times in our
[58:50] lives we're dried up we're barren
[58:55] because we don't bear the image of
[58:58] Christ we're what we call so-called
[59:02] Christians Sunday morning
[59:06] worshippers brother Bram calls
[59:09] them Church
[59:11] Angels Road
[59:15] Angels home
[59:17] Angels Road
[59:23] devils
[59:26] fake we're
[59:29] fake we're fake
[59:32] right now how many wants to be a
[59:35] Christian let me see a show of hands
[59:38] tonight how many wants to be a
[59:41] Christian okay so then if you want to be
[59:45] a
[59:46] Christian it's been told to me by
[59:51] authorities that
[59:53] before they they had the days of the
[59:59] smelter brother Abraham you know what
[1:00:01] the smelter is
[1:00:02] right you worked in the
[1:00:05] smelter before yeah and they used to
[1:00:07] have one in
[1:00:09] Hurley okay so it's been told that the
[1:00:11] days before of the the
[1:00:19] smelter uh to take the dross out of the
[1:00:23] gold
[1:00:25] take the iron and the
[1:00:29] pyite the pyite is so
[1:00:32] close like the real
[1:00:35] gold it's called Fool's
[1:00:40] Gold it's fake it's fo's
[1:00:44] gold but the way they got all of that
[1:00:50] out now how many wants to be a
[1:00:52] Christian okay so the way that they got
[1:00:54] all that
[1:00:56] out that they beat it out with a
[1:01:01] hammer that's right have we changed our
[1:01:04] minds
[1:01:06] yet the Indians used to do
[1:01:09] that
[1:01:11] IND and the old Goldsmith used to do
[1:01:15] that beat it with a
[1:01:17] hammer turn it over and over and beat it
[1:01:22] until the DW was out of it
[1:01:25] the only way that they knew that it was
[1:01:27] down to the
[1:01:30] gold was when the
[1:01:33] beater could see his reflection in
[1:01:37] it the one who was beating could
[1:01:39] constantly
[1:01:42] look until he could almost
[1:01:47] shave by his own
[1:01:52] reflection of in the the gold that he
[1:01:55] was
[1:01:56] beating and when the holy spirit of God
[1:01:59] begins to beat on
[1:02:02] us with a gospel
[1:02:05] Hammer until all the things of the world
[1:02:08] is beaten
[1:02:12] out and we can reflect the image of the
[1:02:15] Lord
[1:02:17] God then I believe we become
[1:02:22] Christians for the word chrisan
[1:02:25] is to be
[1:02:27] Christlike to reflect
[1:02:30] him now that doesn't mean that we grow a
[1:02:35] beard right and so we saw that one time
[1:02:38] in uh Colombia
[1:02:41] right a man dressed like
[1:02:44] Jesus and everybody was like oh there's
[1:02:47] Jesus and and our pastor confronted the
[1:02:51] man next thing we know
[1:02:55] the man was at the altar I think he got
[1:02:57] baptized
[1:02:59] or all right
[1:03:05] so now how many Wants To Be In His
[1:03:11] Image now what kind of image was
[1:03:15] he he was acquainted with
[1:03:19] grief stricken with
[1:03:21] sorrow he was a great somebody
[1:03:27] he was a great
[1:03:28] somebody and he came as a
[1:03:31] servant he came not to be ministered to
[1:03:34] but to
[1:03:36] minister that's what makes him
[1:03:40] great now to be a
[1:03:44] Christian it says that he would beat it
[1:03:47] out with a
[1:03:49] hammer now as a as a
[1:03:52] testimony um I I most of you
[1:03:56] know that I I Str I
[1:03:59] suffered I I was uh probably back in
[1:04:02] about 2005 I
[1:04:04] guess I began to get a series of pains
[1:04:06] in my
[1:04:07] [Music]
[1:04:09] body right and it was in my in my
[1:04:13] back and and um you know you would get
[1:04:18] ridiculed right oh oh it can't be that
[1:04:22] bad take take a TI
[1:04:26] take a Tylenol and get pick yourself up
[1:04:28] you
[1:04:29] know uh but then uh it went on from
[1:04:35] 2005
[1:04:37] 2015
[1:04:39] 2019 and progressively getting worse and
[1:04:41] worse and
[1:04:43] worse and and then I began to
[1:04:47] wonder I I started thinking well you
[1:04:50] know I I I know I Lord I know you're a
[1:04:53] Healer
[1:04:55] I I know you're a you know I know that
[1:04:57] you can do these things
[1:04:59] but but why me and that that's what
[1:05:02] happens many
[1:05:04] times right we we see job we heard about
[1:05:08] job now
[1:05:10] job he was a
[1:05:12] man and and and and all because he was
[1:05:18] perfect all for the reason of being
[1:05:22] perfect job lost everything
[1:05:25] everything he lost it
[1:05:27] all can can you think of a man help me
[1:05:31] out can you think of a
[1:05:34] man that has gone through what job went
[1:05:38] [Music]
[1:05:39] through right some some of us here have
[1:05:42] gone through through through through
[1:05:46] distress we've lost family
[1:05:49] members parents have lost their
[1:05:52] children things we read about brother
[1:05:54] Bram the struggles that he went
[1:05:56] through we've seen it in the life of our
[1:06:00] pastor right but but
[1:06:03] job he lost
[1:06:07] everything and it says here that
[1:06:10] job he had seven sons and three
[1:06:15] daughters his substance also was 7,000
[1:06:20] sheep and 3,000
[1:06:23] camels and 500 Yol of
[1:06:26] oxen and 500 she
[1:06:30] asses and a very great
[1:06:34] household he lost
[1:06:38] everything right sometimes we say oh I
[1:06:40] lost a
[1:06:42] lot oh they took everything from me what
[1:06:45] did you have brother Dan I had 20
[1:06:49] bucks they took it
[1:06:53] all right but job lost
[1:06:57] everything can you imagine the
[1:07:00] news if you read down in verse
[1:07:03] 13 and there was a day when his sons and
[1:07:05] his daughters were eating and drinking
[1:07:07] wine in their eldest brother's
[1:07:16] house and there came a messenger unto
[1:07:18] job and said The Oxen were plowing and
[1:07:21] the asses feeding beside them and the
[1:07:24] sabians fell upon them and took them
[1:07:25] away yay have slain they have slain all
[1:07:29] the servants with the edge of the sword
[1:07:30] I am the only one that escaped alone to
[1:07:32] tell
[1:07:46] thee right and then the next verse
[1:07:49] says and while that man was yet
[1:07:52] speaking another servant came and he
[1:07:56] said job all the camels are
[1:08:00] gone the calans came and took all the
[1:08:03] camels and while he was yet
[1:08:07] speaking another man comes and and says
[1:08:09] hey what wait they took all the all the
[1:08:13] all the ox and the Sheep the
[1:08:18] camels talk about getting some bad news
[1:08:20] all at
[1:08:22] once
[1:08:24] but job lost
[1:08:27] everything now we we we hear the story
[1:08:30] of
[1:08:31] job right and I'm sure that
[1:08:35] job like many of
[1:08:37] us he he probably began to wonder
[1:08:41] himself like that that's what we do
[1:08:43] about this time when when things start
[1:08:45] happening to us
[1:08:47] right when things start happening to
[1:08:51] us oh it's the wife
[1:08:56] fault right oh maybe I'm doing something
[1:09:00] wrong uh no I I know for
[1:09:04] sure it's the brother's fault he wasn't
[1:09:08] in church
[1:09:09] Wednesday he's the one making the whole
[1:09:11] thing
[1:09:15] fail man am I the only one who thinks
[1:09:19] like or am I the only one
[1:09:22] truthful right so no we begin to to to
[1:09:26] question those kind of things
[1:09:28] right but job we know that when he got
[1:09:32] all this
[1:09:34] news the Bible says that he rent his
[1:09:39] clothes and he worshiped God he said
[1:09:43] blessed be the name of the
[1:09:45] Lord the lord giveth and the lord taketh
[1:09:49] away blessed be his
[1:09:52] name how about taking that
[1:09:56] attitude you know uh when my son he he
[1:10:00] he had this uh he was born with this
[1:10:02] Venus
[1:10:05] malformation and and it's a a cluster of
[1:10:07] veins that doesn't
[1:10:09] develop right and then he got into this
[1:10:13] accident and and so when he was little
[1:10:15] actually he had fallen down and we took
[1:10:16] him to the doctor and they said no you
[1:10:18] know he's got a BL brain
[1:10:22] bleed
[1:10:26] and then they they told us well it's
[1:10:27] probably you could probably just leave
[1:10:28] it alone it's not going to grow it's
[1:10:30] just just you know it's just something
[1:10:31] that he
[1:10:35] has so then after he was older he got
[1:10:37] into a car
[1:10:39] accident and hit the windshield right on
[1:10:42] that
[1:10:44] spot so they took him to the do we took
[1:10:47] him to the
[1:10:48] hospital and uh they looked at it and
[1:10:50] they said well it's actually
[1:10:52] grown
[1:10:54] and it's bleeding now so we recommend
[1:10:57] that we you know take it
[1:11:00] out well though they ended up taking it
[1:11:04] out and about two three three four
[1:11:07] months
[1:11:08] later he had a
[1:11:12] seizure and I think those
[1:11:16] seizures I I think those impacted me
[1:11:21] more because
[1:11:24] you know I I I I I believed that the
[1:11:27] Lord was going to heal
[1:11:29] him but every time it would
[1:11:32] happen I I would get so
[1:11:35] angry I mean it would really I mean it
[1:11:37] would it would devastate
[1:11:39] me like like I was like I almost was
[1:11:43] like why
[1:11:45] God why why why why don't you kill
[1:11:49] him right and it and it used to like
[1:11:52] destroy my spirit
[1:11:55] and then all of a
[1:11:57] sudden because of my illness that I
[1:12:00] had I I was at the point of to where I
[1:12:03] was going to have to probably do
[1:12:10] disability in disability and so I I I I
[1:12:13] didn't know what to do I was I was in
[1:12:15] total stress
[1:12:19] distress they they took me to the
[1:12:21] hospital uh they injected my
[1:12:24] back and they said in five minutes
[1:12:27] you're going to be feeling real good
[1:12:31] Mr okay great 10 minutes later the
[1:12:34] doctor comes back by the
[1:12:37] room he says how do you feel said the
[1:12:41] same as when I walked in here oh let me
[1:12:43] give you two of these right here these
[1:12:45] are going to really put you they're
[1:12:47] going to take that pain
[1:12:50] out they gave me a shot of morphing
[1:12:55] they gave me two
[1:12:57] perets and then they after 20 minutes he
[1:13:00] said you got to be feeling real good Mr
[1:13:04] res how do you feel like the minute that
[1:13:07] I walked in
[1:13:09] here you can feel that said yes sir I
[1:13:13] can feel it he gave me another
[1:13:17] shot right and so I was like I was I was
[1:13:21] so stressed out I didn't know what my
[1:13:24] future was going to be I I didn't know
[1:13:27] if I was going to be able to
[1:13:28] work if I would get this
[1:13:31] ability if if if I didn't know uh from
[1:13:35] one day to the next how I was going to
[1:13:38] feel there was days that I couldn't even
[1:13:41] breathe I couldn't move my
[1:13:44] neck I couldn't I couldn't
[1:13:48] function and and and the devil was just
[1:13:50] right
[1:13:51] there I thought he was a Healer
[1:13:55] maybe he's not going to heal you
[1:13:57] though maybe and I would hear
[1:14:01] testimonies and the devil would come and
[1:14:03] say God's not
[1:14:06] real and I would fight back and I would
[1:14:09] say well the very fact that you're
[1:14:11] telling me he's not
[1:14:15] real tells me that he is because you
[1:14:18] wouldn't be
[1:14:21] real I was fighting back back and
[1:14:24] forth but let me tell you God did
[1:14:28] it God did it I can tell you
[1:14:34] today
[1:14:36] 100% I am
[1:14:39] healed I don't have a
[1:14:42] symptom I don't have the slightest
[1:14:48] symptom I've been about a year
[1:14:50] now where I don't even have a pain in my
[1:14:53] my
[1:14:54] back nothing God did it God is
[1:15:00] able let's time for
[1:15:02] us it's time for us to start
[1:15:06] speaking Jesus said if you say to this
[1:15:13] mountain be moved and don't doubt what
[1:15:17] you
[1:15:18] say now let me tell you that wasn't a
[1:15:21] man that said that
[1:15:24] that wasn't a preacher that said that
[1:15:27] that wasn't even brother Bram that said
[1:15:29] that that was God in flesh that said if
[1:15:35] you
[1:15:36] say and believe what you have asked
[1:15:40] for it shall be given unto
[1:15:43] you and why does he do that brother Bram
[1:15:47] says he gives us
[1:15:50] glimpses he gives us glimpses he us
[1:15:54] little
[1:15:55] glimpses but there is going to come
[1:15:58] trial there's going to come
[1:16:01] tribulation now after my back was
[1:16:04] healed my I've had sciatica for a long
[1:16:08] time that was bothering me now today I
[1:16:14] haven't had the
[1:16:15] pain since the day that I was it was
[1:16:18] called
[1:16:20] out I haven't had the pain
[1:16:24] right he gives us
[1:16:26] glimpses just like
[1:16:28] Elijah when he told the servant go out
[1:16:30] and tell me what you
[1:16:32] see he got a little
[1:16:35] Glimpse he said I see the
[1:16:37] cloud I see a cloud about the size of a
[1:16:41] man's
[1:16:43] hand that was just a little
[1:16:45] Glimpse and the prophet said oh I hear
[1:16:49] the
[1:16:50] sound of abundance of rain Glory of
[1:16:54] abundance of
[1:16:56] rain he gave me that little Glimpse in
[1:17:01] myself so that I would
[1:17:04] know that my son is healed
[1:17:09] 100% I believe that I believe it
[1:17:14] with it was a
[1:17:16] glimpse because what I had was going to
[1:17:19] take
[1:17:20] surgery it was going to take Sur surgery
[1:17:24] and I bet you I bet you if I went to the
[1:17:28] doctor tomorrow and I got an
[1:17:32] MRI I bet you that those MRI
[1:17:36] results would show a new
[1:17:40] spine you know why because God did it
[1:17:45] God did it God can do it he is
[1:17:50] [Applause]
[1:17:52] able and he gives us those
[1:17:55] glimpses to let us
[1:17:57] know whatever the
[1:18:01] trial but let me tell you the trials are
[1:18:04] going to
[1:18:05] come the trials will
[1:18:09] come and when you find yourself in those
[1:18:13] trials the prophet of God
[1:18:15] said it it it it has to be it it's after
[1:18:21] crucifixion after cruci
[1:18:23] ition Jesus had to go to the
[1:18:26] Cross so that he could be
[1:18:29] pressed so that he could be
[1:18:32] Crush so that the
[1:18:34] perfume in that flower could come out he
[1:18:39] had to be
[1:18:41] crushed
[1:18:42] bruised before the cross he he couldn't
[1:18:46] uh he couldn't
[1:18:47] say all power in heavens and earth is
[1:18:50] given unto
[1:18:51] me
[1:18:53] but brother Brown says that after
[1:18:56] crucifixion that he could stand and say
[1:19:00] all powers in Heaven and
[1:19:02] Earth are given unto me after the
[1:19:07] trial after the trial of our
[1:19:10] faith and what is it for it's to work
[1:19:14] patience in
[1:19:16] us it's to work
[1:19:19] patience now let me just read that to
[1:19:21] you
[1:19:28] now he is not talking about his faith
[1:19:31] now see he's talking about in the
[1:19:33] pergamus church age when he said I know
[1:19:35] your
[1:19:38] faith but he is commending them for
[1:19:40] their
[1:19:43] faithfulness and as he does also mention
[1:19:45] their
[1:19:48] patience now faithfulness and patience
[1:19:50] go
[1:19:51] together
[1:19:53] in fact
[1:19:55] patience is the outcome of
[1:19:58] faithfulness for it says in James
[1:20:01] 1:3 the trying of your faith worketh
[1:20:04] patience there is absolutely no other
[1:20:07] way in which to gain
[1:20:10] patience it has to come by
[1:20:14] trial or by faith Romans 511 tribulation
[1:20:18] work
[1:20:19] patience how highly God regards his out
[1:20:22] working of our
[1:20:26] patience it's seen in James
[1:20:29] 1:4 but let
[1:20:32] patience have her perfect
[1:20:34] work that you may be
[1:20:38] perfect you may be
[1:20:41] Christlike you can be an image of Christ
[1:20:45] as he said be therefore
[1:20:48] perfect even as I am perfect even as
[1:20:51] your father which is in heaven
[1:20:55] that may be perfect and
[1:20:57] entire lacking
[1:21:00] nothing God will God's will for
[1:21:04] us is
[1:21:06] perfection and that
[1:21:08] Perfection is
[1:21:11] patience it's time for us to take it
[1:21:15] back the prophet of God says that we
[1:21:18] have a right to go to Satan and tell him
[1:21:23] in his
[1:21:24] face we take it
[1:21:27] back that belongs to
[1:21:30] us that's mine that
[1:21:33] healing my health that's mine my child
[1:21:39] that's mine take it
[1:21:41] back it's time we take it
[1:21:44] back and we we we say many times in
[1:21:50] closing I I I want to be Christ like
[1:21:54] like amen amen how many would like to be
[1:21:57] like
[1:21:58] Paul right a minute everybody everybody
[1:22:01] wants to be like
[1:22:02] David everybody wants to be like
[1:22:05] Joshua everybody wants to be like
[1:22:08] Caleb how many here wants to be like
[1:22:10] Paul Paul said that when it pleased
[1:22:14] God separate me from my mother's
[1:22:18] womb and by called me by his
[1:22:20] grace to reveal himself in
[1:22:24] me to reflect himself through
[1:22:28] me how many wants to be like that right
[1:22:32] want to be like Paul everybody wants to
[1:22:34] be like Paul Paul said I I was shipwreck
[1:22:38] many
[1:22:39] times I was beaten 39
[1:22:43] times 39
[1:22:45] times five times I was spit
[1:22:50] upon I was in trouble on the
[1:22:53] sea I was in trouble in the
[1:22:56] wilderness I had problems everywhere I
[1:22:59] went when's the last time
[1:23:02] you have been punched in the
[1:23:05] face anybody here ever been testifying
[1:23:09] to
[1:23:10] somebody and they just punch you in the
[1:23:13] face have have you ever
[1:23:16] anybody have you ever gone up to
[1:23:18] somebody that that that that's living in
[1:23:21] sin
[1:23:23] and called out their
[1:23:24] sin and they punch you in the
[1:23:29] face and you take
[1:23:32] it no no no no no not
[1:23:36] us no right not
[1:23:38] us you punched me in the face
[1:23:41] buddy there's going to be some we're
[1:23:43] going to start throwing some hands
[1:23:45] here you're going to catch these hands
[1:23:49] right Paul says I was punched in the
[1:23:51] face
[1:23:53] I was
[1:23:54] beaten all for the glory of
[1:23:57] God and I did it I did it all for his
[1:24:02] glory and
[1:24:04] closing let's go over to First
[1:24:07] Corinthians chapter
[1:24:20] n and I'm going to start with verse 22
[1:24:23] and as they have it up
[1:24:27] there I'm going to read it out of this
[1:24:29] version so you just follow
[1:24:34] along verse 22 I became weak to the weak
[1:24:37] to win the
[1:24:40] weak not us white we want to be
[1:24:43] strong don't tell me what to do I became
[1:24:47] weak to the weak to win the
[1:24:51] week I have adapted to the culture of
[1:24:53] every place I've
[1:24:55] gone so that I could more easily win
[1:24:58] people to
[1:25:00] Christ I've done all this so that I
[1:25:03] would become God's partner for the sake
[1:25:05] of the
[1:25:08] Gospel it is
[1:25:11] obvious it's obvious I'm going to prove
[1:25:14] to you that Paul wasn't what you think
[1:25:17] in your
[1:25:19] mind or what I think in my mind
[1:25:22] I I think of like you know an old man
[1:25:26] like Paul an old man you
[1:25:29] know I'm going to prove to you something
[1:25:31] different
[1:25:32] here it's obvious that all Runners on
[1:25:35] the racetrack keep on running to
[1:25:40] win but one receives the Victor's
[1:25:45] prize yet each one of you must run the
[1:25:48] race to be
[1:25:51] victorious
[1:25:53] a true
[1:25:54] athlete will be disciplined in every
[1:26:00] respect practicing constant self-control
[1:26:03] in order to win a laurel
[1:26:11] wreath that quickly
[1:26:14] Withers but we run our race to win a
[1:26:17] Victor's Crown that will last
[1:26:21] forever
[1:26:24] for the
[1:26:25] reason oh for that reason I don't run
[1:26:29] just to
[1:26:31] exercise how many you like to
[1:26:35] exercise well I'm not even going to look
[1:26:36] out in the
[1:26:38] audience Paul's saying right
[1:26:40] here I
[1:26:43] exercise but he says I don't just
[1:26:46] run just for
[1:26:49] exercise brother
[1:26:51] Enzo neither do I
[1:26:54] box Paul was a
[1:26:56] boxer Paul was a boxer he was a top
[1:27:00] level
[1:27:01] athlete he said neither do I box like
[1:27:04] one throwing punches to the
[1:27:07] wind we got a lot of Shadow boxers in
[1:27:10] here right we got a lot of Shadow
[1:27:13] boxers get in the
[1:27:18] mirror Paul says I don't do that I don't
[1:27:22] throw punches in the wind
[1:27:25] aimlessly I throw punches for a
[1:27:29] purpose but I
[1:27:32] train Like A Champion
[1:27:35] athlete I subdue my
[1:27:37] body and get it under
[1:27:40] control why does he do that he says I
[1:27:44] subdue my body
[1:27:46] like I'm
[1:27:48] disciplined I watch what I
[1:27:51] eat I watch what goes in I watch what
[1:27:55] goes out I watch what I
[1:27:58] say if you
[1:28:00] say Paul says I'm a champion
[1:28:04] athlete and I subdue myself in
[1:28:08] that under
[1:28:10] self-control I subdue my body and get it
[1:28:14] under my
[1:28:15] control so that after preaching the Good
[1:28:18] News to
[1:28:21] others that after oh they didn't put the
[1:28:23] scripture in the King James version it
[1:28:26] so
[1:28:28] after preaching the Good News to
[1:28:34] others I myself won't be
[1:28:43] [Applause]
[1:28:45] disqualified let me see real
[1:28:48] quick verse 27 but I keep my body
[1:28:52] I keep under my body and bring it into
[1:28:57] subjection lest that by any
[1:29:01] means when I have preached to
[1:29:04] others I myself should be a cast
[1:29:10] away right after preaching to
[1:29:15] others so that I
[1:29:17] myself will not be
[1:29:20] disqualified you want to be like Paul
[1:29:23] let's all stand to our
[1:29:31] feet images of
[1:29:33] [Applause]
[1:29:36] Christ images of
[1:29:39] Christ through
[1:29:41] Patience by the working of the patience
[1:29:43] in
[1:29:45] us I I I I think about
[1:29:50] how how it could be so easy for
[1:29:55] us oh it could be so
[1:29:59] easy when people gave their lives for
[1:30:01] this
[1:30:07] gospel the reason I can Preach
[1:30:10] Today is because a man gave his
[1:30:15] life a man gave his
[1:30:17] life and and not only did he he give his
[1:30:20] life
[1:30:22] it was
[1:30:24] crushed
[1:30:26] squeezed all the way until you want you
[1:30:28] want the best out of the
[1:30:32] juice you want the best juice out of the
[1:30:35] out of the
[1:30:37] fruit it all the way down to the
[1:30:40] end so let me tell you
[1:30:43] Brothers God is here God Is A
[1:30:47] Healer God will heal
[1:30:49] you but we're going to go through trials
[1:30:53] brother and Paul says I glory in my
[1:30:59] infirmities let's not forget
[1:31:05] that it's through the working of our
[1:31:09] patience that we believe on him
[1:31:13] tonight and it only teaches
[1:31:16] us to depend on him
[1:31:20] amen
[1:31:22] Hallelujah all
[1:31:25] [Music]
[1:31:39] together through it
[1:31:43] all oh through it
[1:31:48] all I've learned to trust in Jesus Jesus
[1:31:52] Oh I have learned to trust in
[1:31:56] God through it
[1:32:00] all through it
[1:32:04] all I've learned to depend upon his
[1:32:10] [Music]
[1:32:13] word
[1:32:15] I
[1:32:17] sorrow I've had questions for tomorrow
[1:32:24] in all right from
[1:32:26] [Music]
[1:32:31] wrong every
