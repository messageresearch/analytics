[35:38] corinthians chapter two
[35:40] capitulo dos
[35:54] i was debating whether to go english to

[36:27] has already given us
[36:34] be patient
[36:38] chapter 2 the first corinthians

[37:08] ear hurt
[37:11] we haven't heard anything we still want
[37:13] to hear

[37:21] man
[37:24] the things with god has prepared for
[37:26] them that love him
[37:31] i love this scripture brother you almost
[37:32] i always thought it was in the future
[37:42] what the lord has for us and he still
[37:44] has a lot more for us
[37:47] when we go to heaven he says you're
[37:48] going to hear it right now
[37:51] not by me no no for me
[37:56] let's have a word of prayer
[37:57] lord i thank you for this opportunity
[38:01] today with my brothers and sisters lord
[38:15] my brother jacob and my wife susie
[38:18] hermano hermann

[38:28] lord perfect

[38:41] testimony lord
[38:44] help those that have questions in their
[38:45] hearts
[38:51] thank you lord gracias
[38:53] you can be seated
[38:56] every time we say you can be seated uh
[38:58] in some ways i don't like it because
[39:00] it's like ordering you to do this and up
[39:01] and down
[39:06] my wife i knew her when she was catholic
[39:12] and i had the message in my heart
[39:18] to the lord
[39:21] and that was one of the things that
[39:24] i went with her to a catholic church
[39:28] i told her you know what it's a good
[39:30] exercise because they get up and down up
[39:32] and down
[39:37] good workouts
[39:40] but i went anyway
[39:42] and the time came when the lord touched
[39:44] your heart
[39:50] you need you deserve this
[39:53] [Music]
[39:55] i'm going to take you to hear a real man
[39:57] of god preach the word
[40:05] it only took one service brother
[40:08] that she wanted to get baptized
[40:11] one service our following
[40:17] and he also he didn't resist yeah
[40:24] and the lord spoke to her in other ways
[40:26] the lord gave her dreams about brother
[40:28] branham
[40:29] suenos
[40:31] i didn't even have to worry about
[40:32] anything
[40:35] took care of everything
[40:44] and before i go further further into my
[40:46] testimony
[40:47] testimony let's go to saint john chapter
[40:49] 21
[40:51] 2
[40:53] like i said i'm going to read a lot of
[40:55] scripts like brother abraham says
[41:00] i love that man he
[41:02] starts a little slow and then he takes
[41:03] off
[41:07] amen he read scriptures and that's what
[41:10] the purpose of it scripture
[41:13] is
[41:17] what made him so noble
[41:19] [Music]
[41:44] description i'm going to read it
[41:46] because we took a trip to mexico
[41:50] and it took an invitation from my pastor
[41:53] that i thank him for the confidence
[42:00] and i was surprised
[42:03] invited my brother jacob too but jacob
[42:05] had plans already an invitation to go to
[42:07] alaska
[42:11] and he'll go to mexico sometimes
[42:15] well the reason i read this scripture
[42:16] because i was
[42:18] they're sitting there and i was sitting
[42:20] over there like for brother
[42:22] uh
[42:23] guerra there
[42:26] um
[42:28] was watching him and the lord was
[42:30] telling me
[42:31] he was saying the lord is saying verily
[42:33] verily
[42:36] i say unto thee when that was young
[42:40] thyself and walketh with all
[43:42] [Music]
[44:19] and then we got ready and then all the
[44:20] confusion the airport and
[44:22] security
[44:25] makes it more hectic
[44:28] and you got to do this you got to fill
[44:30] out this paper
[44:34] make certain reservations
[44:37] and i felt like a little boy
[44:40] my wife would tell me don't lose them
[44:41] they were walking fast
[44:46] over here and i thought it was like a
[44:47] parachute he had a heater
[45:01] but then i
[45:03] was glad that i was going there
[45:06] the lord had already told me
[45:09] i'm going to take you to mexico city one
[45:10] of these days
[45:14] but i knew i was going to go
[45:16] and when
[45:45] as an older person
[45:47] the only problem also won two days after
[45:49] i got back those years
[45:52] like they say that's when i got a little
[45:53] bit sick
[45:55] but no not over there everything was
[45:57] great
[46:12] another thing about mexico city

[1:04:34] thank you so much for letting me know
[1:04:36] what everybody thinks is
[1:04:51] and i'm going to say a word of caution
[1:04:53] brother
[1:04:54] i will steal the album
[1:04:56] i don't say this no the question because
[1:04:58] i rejoice in something that bad that
[1:05:00] happens
[1:05:06] the bible says that um
[1:05:08] the charity it doesn't boast on uh
[1:05:11] against evil against evil of what
[1:05:13] something happens
[1:05:14] foreign
[1:05:59] i like to bring this up because my mom
[1:06:01] was there when i was bringing that
[1:06:42] you know and then uh
[1:06:44] something awesome happened
[1:06:47] and i was bringing that teaching on the
[1:06:48] spoken word
[1:06:52] i had my
[1:06:54] my board you know they put aside and i
[1:06:56] had a pulpit on the bottom
[1:07:11] and then at the end of the teaching
[1:07:22] and i was waiting for her and they said
[1:07:24] she embraced me
[1:07:38] was filled with white rock cheese sauce
[1:07:40] white stones all over the top of the
[1:07:42] outside
[1:07:44] wow that revelation that was for them
[1:07:48] it was awesome brother
[1:07:50] mom she was crying she couldn't hold
[1:07:52] herself she was shaking my mouth
[1:08:06] wow she just
[1:08:08] did you know pentecost
[1:08:12] it was a little too much for her
[1:08:16] and those things happen
[1:08:19] spoken word
[1:08:49] i'm baptized in the name of jesus christ
[1:08:56] that's not totally what i'm saying
[1:08:58] what you need to pull out
[1:09:02] all the hybrid i don't love that when he
[1:09:04] said
[1:09:18] that is not conformed to the spoken word
[1:09:21] of god
[1:09:23] with your own ideas and traditions
[1:09:25] you're going to hybrid the original
[1:09:27] scene
[1:09:31] a teacher where i was at ministry
[1:09:35] i realized i cannot do that anymore
[1:09:39] i pulled back and i said probably jimmy
[1:09:41] i understand now
[1:09:44] yes i was baptized in the name of jesus
[1:09:46] christ see if we
[1:10:08] you get a second base so third base they
[1:10:10] start they they
[1:10:11] they
[1:10:12] spike you out there or or even when
[1:10:14] you're for now you're trying to bat well
[1:10:17] you've got to go back to home base
[1:10:19] no matter what it's not like home run
[1:10:21] you go around
[1:10:24] i'm going to tell you one thing
[1:10:25] denomination is not going to make a home
[1:10:27] run nomination
[1:10:43] just like brother abraham peaches
[1:10:46] it hurts a little bit
[1:10:48] when he says we came from cemeteries
[1:10:51] and that is the truth
[1:10:56] we were dead even in denominations
[1:10:59] you have to be reborn again
[1:11:02] you have to be re-baptized like i said
[1:11:04] about this
[1:11:05] and i had to face that you don't can't
[1:11:07] carry it and all the criticism that came
[1:11:09] with it
[1:11:47] your righteousness is not greater than
[1:11:49] the pharisees see
[1:11:52] he said if it's not your righteousness
[1:11:54] it's not greater than that
[1:11:56] because the
[1:11:57] sales not enter the kingdom
[1:12:01] so i have to look for the rightness in
[1:12:03] the lord
[1:12:05] yes
[1:12:06] word and that's my testimony when it
[1:12:09] comes to re-baptism
[1:12:12] i don't know
[1:12:14] some of you have been baptized in the
[1:12:16] message
[1:12:18] some of you i don't know whether you've
[1:12:19] been baptized in denominations
[1:12:30] that's awesome brothers and uh there's
[1:12:32] so many great things the lord has
[1:12:35] showing us that i'm going to go into
[1:12:36] another
[1:12:39] outro revelation apocalypse's

[1:17:06] had to share hearing i'm going to share
[1:17:07] it with you
[1:17:11] what was the first project that we're
[1:17:13] talking revelations chapter
[1:17:26] this is what amazed me brothers you know
[1:17:28] you're looking for
[1:17:43] and he hear the voice
[1:17:45] he said
[1:17:53] your me and brother jimmy we share with
[1:17:54] her and bro hector
[1:17:56] what do you think of that
[1:17:59] john here describes him juan aquilo
[1:18:02] and he says i turned to see the voice
[1:18:04] and respect to me and being turned i saw
[1:18:07] seven golden sticks
[1:18:25] i remember them one day when i was
[1:18:26] reading
[1:18:28] the scriptures
[1:18:33] in mexico
[1:18:36] i was i mean i could read one book
[1:18:38] through in one
[1:19:08] i was reading that book but i saw him
[1:19:10] praying for sick people
[1:19:14] it was beautiful when i saw him i kept
[1:19:17] you know it was like a little vision i
[1:19:19] mean it's hard to describe these things
[1:19:24] i looked up
[1:19:26] and i saw all the prophets
[1:19:33] and that's it
[1:19:36] the lord told me this is what he is
[1:19:39] he takes the prophet
[1:19:43] it takes a prophet to open your eyes
[1:19:47] takes a prophet
[1:19:48] recognize
[1:19:57] the bible says that he is like unto the
[1:20:00] son of man
[1:20:13] what do you want me to give this
[1:20:14] testimony he says i got ministers that
[1:20:16] out there they're just curious about
[1:20:17] what all of you are doing
[1:20:20] and i know you're out there
[1:20:23] i think these are the the truth
[1:20:26] wherever you are you're curious
[1:20:30] come
[1:20:41] i was hearing brother caleb that people
[1:20:43] out there in the east i don't know where
[1:20:45] they're at
[1:20:47] i'm very critical about this ministry
[1:20:50] and look right now immediately they came
[1:20:53] in and they saw it's totally different
[1:20:55] even
[1:20:57] different that's why i challenge anybody
[1:20:58] out
[1:21:26] it's a little different from the
[1:21:27] mornings right
[1:21:31] you know
[1:21:32] brother jimmy brother jimmy tully
[1:21:35] hector just be yourself
[1:21:38] i'm only halfway
[1:21:40] there
[1:22:07] oh
[1:22:38] amen
[1:22:43] and i felt at his feet to worship him
[1:22:46] and he said unto me
[1:22:49] siddha do it not i am a fellow servant
[1:22:53] and thy brethren that have the testimony
[1:22:55] of jesus worship god for the testimony
[1:22:58] of jesus
[1:23:18] and chapter 20 verse 9.
[1:23:21] no 22 i'm sorry 22 verse 9.
[1:23:29] dan says he unto me saw
[1:23:32] see though do it not for i am thy spell
[1:23:34] servant and i kind of by brethren the
[1:23:37] prophets and of them which keep the
[1:23:39] saints of this book worship god
[1:23:42] [Music]
[1:24:00] a lot of people
[1:24:01] they they think we're fanatics
[1:24:05] we tell them it's brother brown
[1:24:09] yeah his brother william bradley sent
[1:24:12] him on william marion branham
[1:24:14] they don't have to tell me over and over
[1:24:16] again
[1:24:23] you're the only one that can see all the
[1:24:25] fellow servants
[1:24:37] but he is our fellow servant and he
[1:24:39] brought us the whole revelation
[1:24:52] [Music]
[1:24:53] and all of a sudden the lord just stops
[1:24:55] when he says now do you see this the
[1:24:56] repentance is though i was always
[1:24:59] wondering how come in the book of acts
[1:25:01] it speaks of joel
[1:25:06] and then brother branham he speaks about
[1:25:09] those roman insects they that ate up the
[1:25:12] the plant
[1:25:16] and i said how did he know that come on
[1:25:20] well he said the lord told me
[1:25:22] the prophet here he's quoting the
[1:25:24] prophet in the book of the book of acts
[1:25:26] that's what i'm telling you
[1:25:28] and we think we know the bible
[1:25:31] i said that's right because
[1:25:33] was prophesizing everything that was
[1:25:35] going to happen in the church
[1:25:42] brother william german william in his
[1:25:44] powerful message in mexico city
[1:25:49] on those insects
[1:25:52] he's always
[1:26:14] yeah you know he just needed the work
[1:26:16] you know
[1:26:17] awesome man i was seeing all these
[1:26:18] things happening
[1:26:20] danny
[1:26:34] was saying you know the way he gets into
[1:26:37] out there in the province when he's
[1:26:38] going to lead the songs he starts right
[1:26:40] off el caminos
[1:26:42] because you don't want to follow but
[1:26:44] he's got that gift
[1:26:47] he gets into it
[1:26:49] he doesn't scold the church and he goes
[1:26:51] bam and he gets into it
[1:26:54] i love that you know
[1:26:55] he says if you don't follow us because
[1:26:57] i'm wrong
[1:26:59] we you know we say beautiful things too
