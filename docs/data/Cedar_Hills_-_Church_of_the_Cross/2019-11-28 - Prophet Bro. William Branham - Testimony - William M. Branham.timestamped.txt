[18:23] much as enjoying those songs I like to
[18:27] hear their you know I love good singing
[18:30] and I hear plenty of it want to come
[18:35] down here usually I'm not want to come
[18:37] down having heating services or
[18:39] something out that's County stay along
[18:41] by the south and then the boys get these
[18:44] tapes and then when I get home I have
[18:47] some work to do in the office and I sit
[18:49] down and listen to those tapes over and
[18:52] over I hear everything had said and I'm
[18:55] glad to see brother careful so here this
[18:56] morning an old friend the gospel it many
[19:01] years ago was out in this same work
[19:03] praying for the sick perhaps years
[19:05] before I ever knew about praying for
[19:08] this city and so another man here
[19:12] personal friends I see great post your
[19:16] last night in the tabernacle of a
[19:18] Jeffersonville and so we're very glad
[19:23] and I met brother young brown I said
[19:26] brother Jack said his name was young and
[19:28] it fits him when he told me he was 60
[19:31] something years old I can hardly believe
[19:33] he hasn't changed a bit since the first
[19:35] time I hear he forgot you this looks the
[19:37] same
[19:38] well God is good to us
[19:42] and I like those away them songs this
[19:46] morning with with a dick to it something
[19:48] it's real something and it means
[19:51] something you can drink it in I could
[19:54] hardly refrain crying right out loud
[19:56] when I've heard them singing that song
[19:59] about talk about the 23rd psalm there
[20:01] and then then come over in this lovely
[20:04] song and they just sang a trio there
[20:06] just to think of the there's something
[20:09] in it that you feel on the inside of you
[20:12] your emotions pulsating knows that the
[20:15] kingdom of God is near hand all these
[20:18] things that we've talked about and
[20:20] wondered about is now fixing to take
[20:22] place some of us may fall asleep before
[20:26] that time comes but that will not
[20:28] prevent our resurrection because it
[20:31] gives us the privilege of coming before
[20:33] those are changed trumpet of God's will
[20:36] sound the dead in Christ rise first then
[20:38] we which are alive and remain do you
[20:41] notice all of the Resurrection shall be
[20:42] caught up together with them when you
[20:45] meet each other before you meet him they
[20:47] caught up together to me then with them
[20:50] to meet the Lord in the air
[20:52] see he's God and then when he wants us
[20:56] to be worshiped that's what his very
[20:58] nature it is to be worshiped because
[21:00] he's God and he knows if we were there
[21:04] be looking at a quarry rise if the other
[21:06] ones there but and then it wouldn't be
[21:08] there completey way of free worship when
[21:11] we stand there and and we know we've met
[21:14] each other first and greeted each other
[21:16] and then to stand by him who calls it
[21:19] all in saying the songs of redemption as
[21:24] brother Jack as many times made the
[21:26] statement when an Angels encircle the
[21:28] earth with bowed heads not knowing what
[21:29] we're talking about they because they
[21:31] never been redeemed but we had to be
[21:33] redeemed and how many crowning the king
[21:36] of King and Lord of lords I don't know
[21:41] what to say I didn't think about Sammy
[21:42] and
[21:43] just come up here I guess it's testimony
[21:45] time just to give a testimony and so
[21:50] tonight the Lord willing I think I've
[21:53] looked at the little schedule and this
[21:57] services
[21:59] I think I'm to bring my message tonight
[22:02] on the Easter or hardening Thanksgiving
[22:05] a message tonight and then we want to
[22:10] take then perhaps the risks the week if
[22:13] the Lord willing and praying for the
[22:15] sick won't you gather a patch of this
[22:17] little Jubilee of Thanksgiving which is
[22:20] a memorial of a great meeting that was
[22:22] held here one time and stream for a few
[22:25] about three years ago when you had this
[22:28] revelation of coming in and the Lord did
[22:31] bless all nightly here in that meeting
[22:34] and I trust that the Lord will continue
[22:37] and maybe there'll be sold saved here
[22:40] until the last names on the book in
[22:44] God's great recording station on how
[22:47] those who accepted Christ as Savior then
[22:51] fill with this spirit now let's this
[22:54] batter hits a moment I'm thinking about
[22:56] Scripture Lord Jesus we are most
[23:00] grateful people this morning but yet we
[23:03] just limited with expression if our
[23:09] hearts could give away to what we what
[23:11] we want to we don't know how we behave
[23:15] ourselves and there are no wonder you
[23:17] said there are not be room enough to
[23:20] contain the blessing advise before a
[23:22] life honest and we're grateful for this
[23:26] and we just pray Lord as we bow our
[23:29] heads in adoration of you that you will
[23:31] receive our Thanksgiving there's so many
[23:34] things that we have to be thankful for
[23:36] and we could not express them but we
[23:39] just say thanks be to God above all
[23:43] things that we're thankful power is that
[23:45] great gift of God to the world and when
[23:48] God gave his son to make a way for our
[23:52] Redemption we're so grateful for that
[23:54] and we have
[23:55] face that and have sense nor I can
[23:59] remember since a little boy that's what
[24:01] happened live now as I'm getting old
[24:03] know that the Sun will instead of not
[24:06] many more times to lobby something what
[24:09] I'm living for I gonna enjoy know Lord
[24:12] that there's many fellow citizens of the
[24:14] same Kingdom that waits likewise this
[24:17] morning for that time to come for that
[24:19] which we have taken the journey far to
[24:22] serve Him and to try to direct our
[24:24] fellow man alive eternal that great hour
[24:28] is soon approaching we can just somehow
[24:31] feel it down in us that it's it's near
[24:34] then maybe we are able to think and we
[24:38] pray that you'll bless us now and
[24:40] continue with our blessings that thou
[24:42] has been given us this morning
[24:43] and now as we read portion of that word
[24:47] are a verse or two we pray that the
[24:50] great Holy Spirit will take these verses
[24:52] in a testimony to his honor
[24:54] in Jesus name we pray amen I thought of
[24:59] a place your believe it's town and
[25:04] Corinthians Secretariat's 9 the
[25:07] fourteenth verse and fifty father
[25:10] prayers for you which long enter you for
[25:15] exceeding grace of God in you thanks be
[25:22] to God for His unspeakable gift Paul
[25:29] you're speaking of the grace of God
[25:33] that's in you the unspeakable gift of
[25:36] the Holy Spirit that dwells among the
[25:38] people he was thanking God for that that
[25:42] they had the Holy Spirit to come upon
[25:44] these people the unspeakable gift of God
[25:49] so rich and pure nothing in my mind
[25:57] exactly so I thought I just can't give a
[26:02] little
[26:02] testimony my experience with Christ in
[26:07] the last few days has been most glorious
[26:10] all my life you know you've heard me
[26:14] many of Ian's I thought I'd say this for
[26:16] some of the tabernacle people that's
[26:18] sitting here at my congregation of the
[26:21] tabernacle is made up from about three
[26:24] nations of the morning when we speak
[26:26] Mexico Canada United States preneur
[26:29] every year another day there were 28
[26:31] different states for one little
[26:33] sunday-school servicing 28 different
[26:35] states representing I want to say this
[26:37] to the glory of God and traveling I
[26:40] think that to prayer and supplications
[26:44] being a mouth cast as we were rejected
[26:47] by the church world as so called today
[26:50] that Tabernacle has grown into the
[26:52] mightiest headquarters of God's grace of
[26:54] any place that no in the world I've
[26:56] never seen such as a large doing there
[26:59] it's just it's unspeakable how what he's
[27:02] doing there just the humility just the
[27:04] people coming in from everywhere and
[27:07] we're grateful for that little station
[27:10] of were some of the people around the
[27:13] country gathering to enjoy the Grace and
[27:17] spread grace to the others now all my
[27:22] life it seemed I wanted to go west in
[27:24] many areas read these stories and hear
[27:27] the tapes if the tape ministry is the
[27:29] worldwide thing everyone think it's one
[27:31] way God has got scattered and the
[27:33] message back into the headon lands back
[27:36] and more they has to be translated in a
[27:38] Germany and so forth they got tapes to
[27:40] go to their congregations of hundreds
[27:42] and hundreds of people I put a little
[27:45] things in their ears and run onto a tape
[27:47] and just as I'm speaking the minister
[27:49] stands there I'm making the same
[27:50] expressions and in the other languages
[27:53] and brings it out before hundreds and
[27:54] hundreds are being saved and heal this
[27:57] studio tapes going out across the world
[28:00] all in English but being translated in
[28:02] many many different language and tribes
[28:04] around the world we hear from them back
[28:07] through the mail and I'm saying this
[28:11] it's going to be a personal test
[28:13] monie to the glory a vibe that it might
[28:16] be that you'd understand in the coming
[28:19] nights of Laura I want to say if the
[28:22] Lord willing you'll understand like I'm
[28:24] trying to say last night the world
[28:28] coming to a place is falling apart
[28:31] politically socially economically you
[28:35] say economics more money yes but where's
[28:37] it coming from
[28:37] we're borrowing taxes will be paid 30
[28:40] years and today she's broke she's
[28:43] bankrupt nation not this nation of our
[28:46] own and there's no way ever getting it
[28:48] back and it's a trap set exactly to
[28:50] swing this nation into something out of
[28:52] your lies on that well who's got the
[28:55] wealth of the world who owns it sure
[28:58] does wrong want it and whenever we do
[29:01] and we get broke instead of these big
[29:03] merchants to back of whiskey and so
[29:05] forth like have to get the money what
[29:07] will they have to either change the
[29:08] currency or borrow money and when they
[29:11] do it's a birthright so right back
[29:13] exactly this is perfect you just watch
[29:15] the scripture said it's about it I'd
[29:18] like to get a place some time the Lord
[29:20] willing when a tip comes on the scene
[29:21] and I believe that soon I've seen going
[29:24] worldwide I got a worldwide meetings
[29:26] coming now and I'd like to get a place
[29:29] where I just set out for about six weeks
[29:30] just to take those things and go through
[29:32] them you see it back and forth through
[29:34] the scripture and it's astounding to see
[29:36] the ire that we're living it frightens
[29:39] me
[29:39] it frightens me not because in my heart
[29:43] the jar bells are ringing knowing that
[29:45] the coming of the Lord is so close to
[29:47] hand
[29:47] but what frightens me is to know that so
[29:50] many is unprepared for the hour
[29:52] we're crazy that's the bad part I mean
[29:56] he ever heard the story about the
[29:58] squirrels up at that time eh oh of
[30:00] course I gets everywhere I lose
[30:02] something like that happen of the day
[30:04] and I was you've heard the story about
[30:07] the Mount is coming down when the law
[30:09] brought those things on the mountains
[30:11] the other day not my life I'm not a
[30:14] preacher anybody knows it I'm not a
[30:16] preacher but it's made up in a spiritual
[30:19] form of watching things and seeing
[30:22] things moving for warning people things
[30:24] that's coming to pass and it's just
[30:26] that's my makeup I can't help that the
[30:28] more than you can help your makeup but
[30:30] God has put us each one in the body to
[30:32] do certain things now move every
[30:36] objective every movie because everything
[30:38] is governed by some governed by spirit
[30:40] this church is put here for a purpose it
[30:43] is a spirit behind this church certainly
[30:45] spirit behind your home behind every
[30:47] building behind everything there's a
[30:49] spirit motive and objective this church
[30:52] come here to greatly exhaustion system
[30:57] or something then it's Modi's is not
[30:59] right but if it's year to try to
[31:01] achieve something for the kingdom of God
[31:04] then their motive and objective both is
[31:06] rises directly that way now I've been
[31:11] thinking since the ministry and the
[31:13] first second and third phase of the
[31:16] ministry when I first come to Shreveport
[31:18] I told you people that the Lord you lay
[31:21] your hands upon my hand and it would
[31:25] signify the same in the Holy Spirit
[31:27] never fail on time I what told you
[31:29] exactly what was wrong with you I told
[31:31] you then after he told me that day that
[31:33] there would be a time that when you know
[31:35] the very secret of the heart not knowing
[31:37] that the word says that will be I didn't
[31:40] know that but the word does say that the
[31:43] Word of God is a discerner of the
[31:46] thoughts and the intents of the heart
[31:49] Hebrews the fourth chapter now that word
[31:52] you see you must never leave that word
[31:55] you stand exactly with that word the way
[31:58] it's written but no private
[32:00] interpretation to it just say it just
[32:02] the way it's written that
[32:03] is God's Word and that is God God and
[32:07] His Word is the same just the same and
[32:10] as I said last night there's a postive
[32:12] word laid for every age and there 790
[32:15] comes down that projects that hosts a
[32:19] word for that age and you see where
[32:20] we're at today they read what we're
[32:22] supposed to be doing and you'll know how
[32:24] far we are I only see one thing left the
[32:27] coming of the Lord Jesus at any time a
[32:30] rapture for the church and we're to meet
[32:32] him in the air now these things has got
[32:36] to come to pass in this day just as he
[32:39] promised they would do it and now about
[32:43] five years ago after the duck had served
[32:47] its time each one of those phases had
[32:50] served his time and he give visions and
[32:52] may even take listeners and so forth
[32:54] know that there was coming one more
[32:57] phase and he simply dropped that out so
[33:01] perfect there's man sitting right here
[33:03] now I'm looking at right there and seen
[33:05] it take place as perfect as I ever seen
[33:08] in my life and even took pictures of it
[33:10] of what the Lord God said would take
[33:12] place we went right there in there it
[33:13] was just exactly like he said just about
[33:16] like the March 17th a March issue of the
[33:20] Life magazine you see that circle of
[33:22] light in the skies 30 miles high 27
[33:25] miles across while marchers only about 9
[33:28] miles high and they can't even make up
[33:30] what it was in right standing beneath
[33:32] that a man is sitting right president
[33:35] now was right stay there by me when
[33:37] seven angels come down from God visibly
[33:39] standing right there and told me about
[33:41] the end time and these revelations and
[33:43] things of The Book of Revelations to
[33:45] seven seals and said return home and one
[33:47] by one will bring the message that's
[33:49] right and it went right up and get
[33:50] turned why does it went up all up and a
[33:53] blast that shook the mountains to rock
[33:55] size of a of a bucket fell out of the
[33:58] mountains like that in nothing was
[34:00] around even a newspaper said they check
[34:02] to see if there's a sound breaker a
[34:03] plane or something there was nothing
[34:05] Elaine's up there nothing besides a
[34:07] plane breaker could not do that and then
[34:10] it was foretold it be that way six
[34:12] before it happened six months there it
[34:16] was in the science searching it today
[34:18] right there our Tucson in different
[34:20] places they can't understand what was
[34:22] that up there
[34:23] now if you'll get the magazine you're
[34:25] looking even see the shapes their wings
[34:26] and still in there they're going up to
[34:28] seven angels and we're know that these
[34:31] things are correct friends or if there
[34:34] ever was a time that the church ought to
[34:36] be in deep sincerity it should be right
[34:37] now now just it's done something to me
[34:42] uh-huh myself for five years now I've
[34:46] wondered that was wrong I felt in my
[34:49] heart like I was I was all crushed down
[34:52] with something and I couldn't make out
[34:55] what it was doing the time of this great
[34:58] crushing and so forth I've just plaster
[35:02] around around across the country and the
[35:05] government had me under an investigation
[35:07] and because when we have the meeting
[35:09] somebody write a check
[35:10] Julia Brandon and hard to sign up and
[35:12] hand it back and then we got a package
[35:14] of all of all of our meetings and when
[35:17] they look through there and found out
[35:18] that if went into the pay the campaign
[35:21] yet as I sign my name to it identified
[35:24] the check to myself they had me out of
[35:26] the governor $300,000 and they wouldn't
[35:29] let me leave and had to stay here and so
[35:32] forth for a great time to search through
[35:34] all of this and and I'm not everything
[35:37] went they said yes it went into the
[35:39] campaign but the people made the check
[35:41] to you and when you endorsed that you
[35:42] identified yourself with the check and
[35:44] you owe taxes on it if you never even
[35:46] held in a second in your hands you still
[35:48] yours because you're endorsed it I don't
[35:50] know what I don't all the mechanics of
[35:53] this laws and things I supposed to have
[35:55] a stamp to stamp it instead of sign it
[35:57] want to sign it it means it's mine and
[35:59] then they cut right into the package and
[36:01] find there it was placed right into the
[36:03] phone and spin out like that I draw a
[36:05] salary from the Church of $100 a week
[36:07] their sets of Trustees sitting right
[36:09] there it knows that's right and that's
[36:11] all I get from that and otherwise it
[36:14] goes right into the campaign now I felt
[36:18] like I was crushed for last four or five
[36:21] years when I went up into Canada just
[36:24] recently on
[36:26] trip of going hunting and what I did the
[36:29] Lord helped me Authority lead a whole
[36:31] tribe of Indians to the Lord Jesus and I
[36:34] hope to go back when the when the well
[36:36] the prick star up up there and things to
[36:38] baptize the whole tribe in the name of
[36:41] the Lord Jesus because the healing of an
[36:43] Indian woman dying in a heart attack
[36:45] that the priest wouldn't come to we were
[36:48] back in the jungles were ahead ride for
[36:50] hours horseback there are those sitting
[36:53] here now who is present when it happened
[36:56] and now then coming down and had to stop
[36:59] over in Colorado to visit some of my
[37:01] friends there some ministers them I'm a
[37:03] guide in Colorado and I was taking them
[37:05] on a hunting trip to three of those men
[37:07] five of them are studying right present
[37:10] now to know this has been awful dry in
[37:12] Colorado this years it has been across
[37:15] the nation and fires were very would be
[37:18] very bad so they delayed the hunting
[37:20] season awhile but while we were up there
[37:22] there come forth an issue that there was
[37:26] coming a blizzard and it's dangerous to
[37:29] be in the mountains at that time cause
[37:31] you sometimes I've seen you couldn't
[37:33] even see your hand before you four hours
[37:35] after hours and 30 foot of snow dumped
[37:37] right out in one time just in a few
[37:39] hours right I'm talking in your parish
[37:41] so I told my brethren that morning when
[37:44] was leaving out I said now the blizzard
[37:46] practically a hundred manner more had
[37:48] been back in behind us and Here Come
[37:50] jeeps trucks and everything going right
[37:51] on up because they know what was going
[37:53] to happen no one left back but the cow
[37:56] man himself back there which he winners
[37:58] back there and we were the only
[38:00] pepperoni truck it stayed in and I asked
[38:03] the brother and they said we'll go to
[38:04] state so then all right
[38:06] I said now be ready we went out got some
[38:08] a Methodist minister and I went and got
[38:10] some more bread and stuff so we could
[38:12] find it it's about 30 miles in and Bank
[38:14] so we come back brother John and then
[38:17] sitting here they heard that in a way
[38:19] they went they got out at the time so
[38:22] the blizzard struck but we was going to
[38:24] stay over and I was going to Tucson for
[38:26] a meeting and I Apollo my wife and told
[38:29] her that we had if I didn't get there to
[38:31] let somebody else substitute in my place
[38:33] and the next morning we started out I
[38:36] said I have the first time is real
[38:38] cloudy you hear the rain
[38:40] for anything get back to that camp as
[38:42] quick as you can cause within 10-15
[38:44] minutes you'll never see your way back
[38:45] again and so I have the man place top
[38:48] went up over the top of the ridge
[38:50] walking up trying to run deer down on
[38:53] them and I'd few days before that
[38:57] shooting my rifling down in Tucson
[38:59] coming back up there sold it out a
[39:01] little bit to the right I shot a big
[39:03] buck that I've been looking for for many
[39:05] years and it hit him too high and I he
[39:09] had died down there and I couldn't find
[39:10] him the weather was getting bad
[39:12] I thought I run up to take a look and if
[39:14] when I got up on top of the mountain
[39:16] I noticed the rain started the sleet
[39:18] falling and no big drops of snow a size
[39:21] of a silver dollar just plastering
[39:23] everywhere in the winds twisting I knew
[39:25] everyone was on the run back to the camp
[39:27] thing but I waited a few moments and I
[39:30] thought I'll never be able to find this
[39:31] deer at this time under this storm so on
[39:34] we went started down the mountain just
[39:37] could see about ten feet in front of me
[39:38] in about as about four miles or more to
[39:41] get into the place knowing to come down
[39:43] the mountain nor the country so well
[39:44] cause of herding cattle there or years
[39:46] and years coming down the mountain I've
[39:49] got about a half a mile from the saddle
[39:51] the wore out the crossing like this
[39:53] across the range or world was that
[39:55] and there was I've been feeling that
[39:57] horrible burden I've cried I prayed I've
[40:01] confessed what can I do what is it that
[40:04] I've done like you've done something
[40:06] real evil or I could hurt somebody you
[40:10] know you ought to make it right
[40:11] that was I condemned about I knew not I
[40:14] said Lord if you only reveal it to me
[40:16] I'll make it right but whatever
[40:18] understand and preach and do all that I
[40:20] know to do and I've tried will they have
[40:23] cleaned clear and just according to your
[40:25] words but what have I done and still
[40:27] that burden would not let up year after
[40:29] year I thought about it on the mountain
[40:32] that morning and I started down the day
[40:35] before was my anniversary to my wife and
[40:38] I were married 20 years before that and
[40:42] I've never been home for my anniversary
[40:44] and I always go up to the mountain a
[40:47] little place raised some quakin ass the
[40:49] first year we were married I didn't have
[40:51] money to take a honeymoon for a little
[40:54] trip and then take a huntin trip to so I
[40:56] took my wife on hunting trip or the
[40:58] honeymoon so that look like honey
[41:00] getting it or got both at the same time
[41:03] now I remember a little feller out I
[41:05] pick her up lift her over logs and
[41:07] things then we got up to a little place
[41:08] now Tucker picture it's always kind of a
[41:10] convent fair I'll think of that and
[41:13] think of her black hair and how pretty
[41:15] she was now gray and just a few years
[41:18] has done to her I thought I believe I'll
[41:21] go up there but it's too hard snow was
[41:24] too hard then I know I had to get in
[41:25] because they broadcast a severe blizzard
[41:28] on the road you broadcast across the
[41:30] nation I don't work on Simpson setting
[41:32] here this morning out coming down from
[41:34] Canada he was told by radio not to even
[41:37] go through that country at all everybody
[41:39] said don't go through there go that way
[41:41] called a horrible blizzard is sweeping
[41:43] across and I started down the mountain
[41:47] thinking about that about 10 o'clock in
[41:49] the morning and how all the sudden just
[41:51] as plain as you hear my voice the voices
[41:54] stop and turn around and go back and I
[41:57] couldn't tell this amongst people it's
[41:59] unbelievers you only have 30 believers
[42:01] and then because this unbelievers will
[42:04] never understand it you got to have a
[42:07] spiritual mind to understand spiritual
[42:09] things the word is spiritual it's
[42:11] interpreted spiritual and it's a it's
[42:14] God's Word and I stopped I thought if I
[42:18] go back up there another half a mile
[42:21] back up the storm raging like it is and
[42:23] David would and make me a sandwich and
[42:26] it was I think he's getting eaten with
[42:28] me for making his father one month time
[42:30] we didn't have nothing but some onions
[42:32] and honey and bread I put it all
[42:34] together we made us the salmon and you
[42:37] go to hardly eat his I think he was
[42:38] trying to get even with me for that so
[42:40] he put all of war all kind of walk and
[42:42] going up the mountain the rain falling
[42:44] so fast they got it wet is just one big
[42:46] water I thought well I'll eat that wait
[42:48] while I was standing there thought that
[42:50] was nothing I just the marriage as a
[42:52] wind probably waist blowing twisting
[42:54] through these trees and I started to
[42:57] walk on I just could not walk and I
[43:02] thought well I believe I'll go back
[43:05] I heard it again go back where you come
[43:07] from it said that I start up the
[43:10] mountain stop my thought maybe I I was
[43:14] getting scared to go back to world was
[43:15] that because the the winds were so
[43:17] terrific sometimes God makes us do
[43:20] things that it seems very dangerous and
[43:22] out of line
[43:23] how about Moses let's stick going down
[43:25] to take over Egypt and everything we
[43:27] find I can that God asked the
[43:30] Impossibles see so that he does the
[43:33] Impossibles that man will know that it
[43:36] isn't him it's God that's doing it I
[43:39] went back up to the top of the mountain
[43:41] again we'll find him away through the
[43:43] blowing twisting trees now sit down and
[43:46] touch my gun keep the scope and getting
[43:49] up I got bear around in that kind of
[43:51] time and so I put the scope back on him
[43:53] a shirt like this and set down and woman
[43:55] I thought what am i doing sitting here
[43:59] but bad works in mysterious ways his
[44:02] wonders to perform their past finding
[44:05] out to the carnal mind and never catch a
[44:08] glimpse of it and as I walk back up and
[44:11] sit down sitting there thinking on God
[44:14] what a while I'll come back I thought my
[44:16] time to get the bomb to heal that storm
[44:18] getting more terrific all the time
[44:20] closing in you couldn't see very far
[44:22] ahead of it and I thought if you don't
[44:25] have to believe this but this is true a
[44:27] voice spoke to me is that I am the Lord
[44:31] God I've created the heavens and the
[44:35] earth nature obeys me and I sit there a
[44:40] little bit jerked off my head
[44:42] nutboy somewhere I couldn't see it only
[44:44] thing I hear is rounding them trees
[44:46] somewhere
[44:46] I thought usually you see that light
[44:49] that all of you know about usually it's
[44:51] there but I looked at every word I
[44:52] couldn't see the light as it were you Oh
[44:55] God
[44:56] my Creator looked around I couldn't hear
[45:00] no more here is violence I waited a few
[45:02] minutes he said I am the Lord God that
[45:05] had you to speak those squirrels into
[45:07] existence and all of you know about that
[45:09] and it's so healthy for this Bible
[45:11] before me on this Thanksgiving morning
[45:12] if that isn't true God may strike me
[45:14] dead platform now it's true he's still
[45:18] just as much
[45:19] of God a God that could provide a ram
[45:22] for Abraham can provide
[45:24] she still Jehovah Jireh Lord can provide
[45:28] word Abraham get that Ram look three
[45:32] days journey from civilization up on top
[45:34] the mountain where there's no water and
[45:36] apathy and he had need Abba RAM and
[45:40] there was a ram foot in the wilderness
[45:42] by its horns in Abraham it went around
[45:44] and picked up rock all around there to
[45:46] make this altar but God still remains
[45:49] Jehovah Jireh the Lord will provide for
[45:53] himself
[45:54] whatever he's promised that he's able to
[45:56] do that's that word in Mathew there I
[46:00] mean mark 11:22 if you say to this
[46:03] mountain I I never could understand that
[46:05] you know the story about that and so
[46:06] help me that's true he said I am the one
[46:09] that provided that them squirrels he sat
[46:13] down one day listen again and see what
[46:16] he would say nothing stop wind just
[46:18] howling going on I have to bite myself
[46:21] oh let me tell you something real
[46:24] spiritual minds is one step from
[46:27] insanity did you know that a scientific
[46:32] research will tell you that here you are
[46:34] down you're slow and slumpy then you
[46:37] come up a little more spiritual then
[46:39] you're about like this then you go to
[46:40] like a dull ax and then to a home razor
[46:44] now either which side you follow there
[46:46] the man tries to lift the step up there
[46:48] he's sure to go on the wrong side if God
[46:51] lifts him up there he's far above the
[46:53] average person there's word visions and
[46:55] things break through there's where the
[46:57] kingdom of God is ports prophets and oil
[46:59] or considered neurotics Jesus himself is
[47:03] called a crazy man so if we know you're
[47:06] a madman got a devil mad means crazy
[47:08] look at all the ports and prophets
[47:11] through the ages have been considered
[47:13] that that extremely try Wow if you try
[47:16] to pull yourself up there you're gone
[47:18] you'll never make it it takes a hand
[47:20] reaching down from glory to hold you on
[47:22] that edge there between the right and
[47:24] wrong things you're standing all them
[47:28] ages were you look across interview
[47:31] LaLanne
[47:31] then on that very hour it spoke again to
[47:36] that very same time setting up there he
[47:38] said I am the one that stood on the ship
[47:41] that night and made the winds and the
[47:43] waves deceased said rise up on your feet
[47:47] and rebuke this storm and it'll obey
[47:50] exactly what you say that's been that
[47:52] third stage of the ministry coming it's
[47:55] been moving up for years I look like
[47:57] he's stopping it keeps worried I think
[47:59] oh don't but that's exactly what he done
[48:02] and this is him again it's just exactly
[48:04] his spirit again just exactly but I've
[48:07] had so many carnal impersonations up on
[48:09] the other it makes me scared to even
[48:11] think about it cause you're sure there's
[48:14] the world is always the mixed multitudes
[48:16] and that carnal impersonation has to
[48:19] follow it it did in his days it did
[48:21] Moses days he'll do it every day it'll
[48:23] do it in this thing when the Holy
[48:24] Spirit's trying to do the work but still
[48:26] if a person is spiritual the carlyle
[48:29] impersonation only magnifies the right
[48:31] one that the real article of God and
[48:35] standing there at that time I raised
[48:39] that I said Lord God great creator of
[48:41] nature I believe that that you speaking
[48:45] not one time if you ever showed me
[48:47] anything that was wrong not one time
[48:49] have you let me say anything but what
[48:50] come to pass
[48:51] I said therefore I say to this storm
[48:54] that's raging go to your places
[48:57] go back leave this alone and I a command
[49:00] that the Stein will shine for the next
[49:02] four days to these men can get their
[49:04] trophies and yet I can help them get me
[49:06] get out of these mountains and the lad
[49:09] God who is my solemn judge this morning
[49:12] that rain and things twisted within a
[49:15] moment's time there wasn't a bit of it
[49:17] I'm looking as a wind come from the
[49:18] other way across the top of the mountain
[49:21] and lifted up those clouds like that
[49:23] within just a matter of a few minutes
[49:26] the Sun was broke up right to the top
[49:28] and shining right down this is pretty as
[49:30] it could be just the same way did in
[49:33] Germany you remember the story in
[49:34] Germany when them which is 15 on one
[49:36] side took a scissor and cut a feather
[49:39] parted back this way she stood there
[49:40] going through their enchantments and
[49:42] said they'd build a tent away
[49:43] 30,000 people a brother argue right
[49:45] let's stand there and here come the star
[49:47] on the cloud coming right up
[49:48] he stood there but brother lost or many
[49:50] of you know the American born a German
[49:53] here there's my interpreter he he stood
[49:55] right there sighs so don't interpret
[49:56] this lesson Lord God you give me a
[49:58] vision sent me to Germany these witches
[50:01] and brought up the storm you're the god
[50:03] of creation
[50:04] let it be knowing that you're God no one
[50:06] but one could understand the English
[50:07] that was he does in there that no Hera
[50:09] was speaking about just then the tent
[50:12] raising up like this with 30,000 people
[50:14] been either jumping up and down like
[50:16] that settle down and the clouds and
[50:18] thunder roared away in less than five
[50:20] minutes the Sun was shining right down
[50:21] through one about fifteen thousand
[50:24] Germans came to the Lord Jesus Christ
[50:28] he's still God he's just as God as much
[50:32] as the everyone well as I stood there on
[50:35] that hill coming out about four days
[50:37] later anyone here knows the truth not
[50:39] one cloud was in the sky from that hour
[50:42] for four days now come down and go up
[50:45] went by gasoline when we come out of the
[50:48] mountains I said have you been pretty
[50:50] dry stood yes that's been dry said he
[50:52] said we're looking for a storm they come
[50:54] out but we don't know other things
[50:55] stopped me and went on down to the other
[50:58] side of Colorado stop and get some gas
[51:00] Billy Paul my son back there we were
[51:01] together I said let's just see what this
[51:04] stopped down here I drove in I said
[51:06] morning so we started talking to the man
[51:09] he said morning and I said I'm sure a
[51:11] beautiful day said yes you old sons
[51:13] coming out hot again so she sure burn us
[51:15] up this summer I said hey I said well
[51:17] that's all across the nation he said
[51:19] yeah I understand
[51:21] now this is getting almost time for your
[51:23] storms he said you know how said I know
[51:25] the papers radio and everything else to
[51:27] give the storm coming in the clouds come
[51:29] and the storm started and all at once we
[51:31] don't know what happened to it it all
[51:32] away he's still bad just as much bad as
[51:39] he ever was but how can a man say those
[51:43] things unless God tells him first to say
[51:45] it
[51:46] see not under impression but you know
[51:49] what you're saying then do it but wait
[51:52] don't try to say oh that's why many
[51:54] people are think and in gifts of God
[51:56] wait to know it's you know it's God see
[51:59] wait till advice comes in you hear it no
[52:01] it's it then you can say it's thus
[52:03] sayeth the Lord
[52:04] if it isn't thus saith the Lord then
[52:06] it's your impression
[52:07] it's what somebody else thinks people
[52:09] request people say this for me do this
[52:12] for me how can you do it if you're
[52:15] honest with God until God first tells
[52:17] you how can I tell you Gus said Jack
[52:20] Moore and Jack Moore hasn't said nothing
[52:21] to me it's got to come first from God
[52:26] I'm not impressed
[52:27] it's got to be God and then it'll happen
[52:30] or it is then thus saith the Lord
[52:33] my everybody won't have that no sir it
[52:37] won't be that way it never was that way
[52:39] it never will be that way that deals
[52:43] with an individual he did in the days of
[52:45] Noah didn't elevation of Joshua he did
[52:48] in the days of Moses he's always he's
[52:50] never made a system it's been an
[52:52] individual most two men either like no
[52:54] time they never did do them all but
[52:58] everybody didn't have to be Moses they
[53:01] didn't understand they just followed and
[53:03] the holy spirit of a man is a man of God
[53:06] will let you to part of the Holy Spirit
[53:08] the Bible for he is the one who does
[53:11] these things Jesus Christ and the farm
[53:15] of the Holy Ghost working in the people
[53:18] standing there I have started walk back
[53:21] down and stood there a crowd I couldn't
[53:22] help it to see what had happen right
[53:25] there in a moment and the Brethren up
[53:27] there now how many was there somebody
[53:29] here on Oh fred sauceman and him he sure
[53:31] was up there a little afraid what's
[53:33] written in to the other place is there
[53:35] any here now that was up theirs brother
[53:36] banks would say I'm in here yet is there
[53:38] anybody here besides Billy Paul that was
[53:41] up there these boys had just left yeah
[53:44] and brother Woods and brother Taylor are
[53:48] I forget the other brothers need four or
[53:50] five of them were standing there these
[53:53] brother here brother Martin had just
[53:55] laid left the day before all the cow the
[53:56] storm coming you all remember the storm
[53:58] the broadcast they said it was coming
[54:00] not what's that you met her you met them
[54:03] and I notice standing there I thought
[54:07] well I guess I'll go
[54:08] on the hill and I made a bow to God a
[54:11] few years ago going out with a full
[54:13] gospel businessman but I wouldn't shoot
[54:16] game for somebody else
[54:17] unless it's emergency I just wouldn't do
[54:20] it and your brother Jack Palmer is he
[54:22] here brother Jack he's from Georgia he
[54:25] usually comes up here he was stand there
[54:27] and the night before he said brother
[54:28] Branham hit me a deer and my just shot
[54:31] because I know I vowed I wouldn't do
[54:33] that four or five years ago calls that
[54:35] year I kill nineteen head of elk alone
[54:36] just for them businessman to sit around
[54:38] talk through business not have go out
[54:39] and kill her game and then just it
[54:41] seemed like pup in a murder case but I
[54:43] wouldn't do it take them horse at but it
[54:45] won't shoot it so I promised God I
[54:47] wouldn't do that so then I got let the
[54:50] place going back to start dive down the
[54:52] hill and a voice spoke to me said wanna
[54:55] walk with me I said Lord God if that's
[55:00] you I know that only the hand of God
[55:03] could part those clouds and do what
[55:05] you've done here in the form stun
[55:07] shining down drying my shirt out the
[55:09] steam coming up from it I said great
[55:11] Cathedral virgin partial and I said I
[55:15] believe I'll wrap up this way then Lord
[55:17] if you have no certain direction I want
[55:19] to go up there standing just in a few
[55:21] minutes for a little memorial to my wife
[55:23] by bar of our first and only honeymoon
[55:27] you know that we ever had a chance to go
[55:29] and I took her on a hunting trip and
[55:31] Here I am up here this year again
[55:32] hunting with these brethren and her down
[55:35] in Tucson to keep things going
[55:38] now start walking down through there now
[55:40] I got to thinking now this is going to
[55:43] sound very funny and I hurry because I
[55:45] know your service starts at about 10
[55:47] minutes and so I was walking along
[55:50] through there and I was thinking oh why
[55:53] does she never had a set of words in
[55:55] here about going anywhere and this
[55:58] morning I won't tell you what happened
[56:00] in a few minutes I ever man ought to
[56:04] think this I think there's not a woman
[56:06] in the world like my wife she's just a
[56:08] wonderful person
[56:09] little pie stay at home she's always had
[56:12] my clothes ready not be I've gone on the
[56:14] trips or they come in say teacher a
[56:17] little bit say I'm your husband you
[56:18] - like that and kiss the children kneel
[56:21] down had a prayer put on my clothes to
[56:24] keep from having to lose my mind nearly
[56:26] from the crowds and things take off we
[56:28] go fishing or hunting way from her she's
[56:31] had to bear it all alone herself then I
[56:33] got to thinking well maybe when I'm home
[56:36] the only thing I'm always the only thing
[56:38] I know is God and His Word now I'm
[56:40] closely talking with now it's going on
[56:42] there and a presented to me said
[56:44] well maybe she just lets you go because
[56:48] it keep the people away and so forth
[56:51] like that and she can be a little more
[56:53] peaceful when your weight and I begin to
[56:55] accompany that thought I went like that
[56:58] in what I did
[56:59] I seen the whiskers on my face from
[57:01] about a week old and they were better
[57:04] than half grade I thought bill you're
[57:09] just poor you're headed you're headed
[57:11] right on out now you're getting old you
[57:14] already crossed that 50 mark so I just
[57:17] thinking that going on with my rifle
[57:19] hanging on my shoulder walking along
[57:20] like that and all of a sudden something
[57:25] happened it seemed like it ever
[57:27] principal I was a boy again I don't know
[57:30] what nidalee taking place or what it was
[57:32] and I look stand in front of her and
[57:35] there is honey and there she stood just
[57:37] the way she was when I married her I set
[57:41] my gun now to rub my eyes a look at her
[57:44] she held out her arms like this looked
[57:46] at me I bowed my head down close to
[57:49] going right up there for a little
[57:51] memorial for our anniversary stand by
[57:54] those trees a bunch little trees up
[57:55] earthquake and ask just like was up in
[57:57] the North Woods when we went up in
[57:59] Adirondack and I always go up there each
[58:02] 23rd day of October when I'm up there
[58:06] and there she was now done set my rifle
[58:09] down look there now I stopped a minute
[58:12] and I bowed my head I look back and she
[58:15] was still standing there with her arms
[58:16] yeah no I haven't surely lost my mind I
[58:22] looked again I thought why would this be
[58:25] here I was a young fella I looked at my
[58:28] hands
[58:29] I said I lord my responsibility in the
[58:35] world to bring your message surely this
[58:38] is something happened to me and I looked
[58:41] again then it just faded away and I
[58:44] picked up my rifle put on my shoulder
[58:47] I said maybe that you let me know that
[58:50] the reason it does break her heart when
[58:52] I have it when I come and go out hunting
[58:54] and things like that but as a star
[58:56] walking on I took off my head again I
[58:58] said God I know that you're here there's
[59:01] no doubt in my mind but what you're here
[59:03] and I believe you ever were
[59:06] you should you make that sun shining
[59:08] down on my back you're the one who does
[59:10] these things your Creator I've been so
[59:13] dilatory it looks like I'm afraid to
[59:15] take a hold I'm afraid I'll I'll do
[59:16] something wrong I said is one thing I
[59:19] will actually do lift the burden from my
[59:21] heart
[59:21] there's no need of me trying to confess
[59:23] anymore because for five years of
[59:25] constantly cried out to you
[59:26] what about done tell me what it is and I
[59:29] was talking up the little hill then
[59:30] right close to where I was going to
[59:32] stand for a few minutes just to thank
[59:34] the Lord for my life and for successful
[59:37] marriage to God to give us and the love
[59:39] we had for each other these years and
[59:41] our children I'll do that ever 23rd day
[59:43] of October and there's a little quake
[59:45] and asked him about or 10 inches thick
[59:47] and come up about like this and went out
[59:49] kind of L and went up and just as
[59:51] walking uphill I got real weak and I
[59:53] just leaned over against that tree like
[59:55] that now you hear something patting on
[59:58] the leaves just a minute now the leaves
[1:00:01] have done dried thyme I've walked there
[1:00:02] about 300 or 400 yards and I look it was
[1:00:08] water coming from my own eyes dropping
[1:00:11] off through the Greybeards down onto the
[1:00:13] ground I said Oh God oh what a failure I
[1:00:18] and standing there and that Ganesha said
[1:00:21] I trust that you'll be merciful to her
[1:00:25] I'll said ain't worthy to ask for mercy
[1:00:29] I said someday I know I'm getting grain
[1:00:32] I got a go Lord and I guess people think
[1:00:37] it's crazy but I find God out in them
[1:00:40] places that's that's
[1:00:42] it's real to me that it's just this is
[1:00:45] realest this right here and I frankly a
[1:00:48] little more so cause G all of your part
[1:00:50] there it looks like I've been standing
[1:00:51] with him alone talking to nobody but him
[1:00:54] and as I stood there I heard the brush
[1:00:57] break and I kind of raised my head up
[1:01:01] with a red shirt on now and a red band
[1:01:03] around my my hat red handkerchief
[1:01:08] wrapped around one of those Western head
[1:01:10] you know and I look and you're stood two
[1:01:12] three deer standing right by me just
[1:01:15] walked up there me and that red all that
[1:01:18] shooting over a hundred man
[1:01:19] they've been shot a forty times I guess
[1:01:22] what sure that is scattered right now
[1:01:24] but they did they just stood looked at
[1:01:28] me and find me two full-grown ponds and
[1:01:32] a big doe and something said to me there
[1:01:36] is a deer for brother Evans one for
[1:01:39] brother Welch and one for the Methodist
[1:01:40] preacher there's exactly what the Lord
[1:01:43] God has given to you now they can't get
[1:01:46] away there's no way for him to ahead a
[1:01:48] rifle hanging on my shoulder right here
[1:01:50] and before they could even got turned
[1:01:52] around I killed all three of them like
[1:01:54] that before they could even move they
[1:01:55] were dried in my hands and I and I
[1:01:58] thought there they are just the three
[1:01:59] easy to roll them right down the hill
[1:02:01] you're and then told them right on out
[1:02:02] and I thought that'd be very easy
[1:02:04] there's the three then we could go home
[1:02:07] from there take out and get out of the
[1:02:10] mountains and as a lookout in there
[1:02:11] they're standing looking at me just as
[1:02:14] tightly about 15 yards 20 well I just
[1:02:18] stood still and I don't worry you fellas
[1:02:20] hunt deer or not but there are one year
[1:02:23] they're don't or not certain they'll fix
[1:02:25] your feet like this goal and then
[1:02:29] they've watched me well there it is on
[1:02:34] things throw my coordinate they're gone
[1:02:37] then I remembered I promised God that it
[1:02:39] wouldn't do it
[1:02:41] now remember them I thought no I can't
[1:02:45] do it but isn't right I promised God
[1:02:48] that I wouldn't do it when you make a
[1:02:50] promise you stay with it
[1:02:53] God expects you to and there I thought
[1:02:56] we're just perfectly in my hands but yet
[1:02:59] I promised him I wouldn't do it
[1:03:01] I said gone mother take your babies and
[1:03:05] wanted the woods
[1:03:06] enjoy yourself I love this too you're in
[1:03:10] my hands but I don't go to Kenya and
[1:03:12] there come a little closer all how
[1:03:15] unusual that is for deer and they look
[1:03:18] at me you know and turn your head and me
[1:03:20] stand there dressed in red with a rifle
[1:03:22] stand in my hand and they walk real
[1:03:24] close to they could almost like feed him
[1:03:26] on my head and they just nosed around
[1:03:29] there a few moments turn around walk on
[1:03:32] back a little piece they stop come back
[1:03:35] again something kept saying they're
[1:03:38] right in your hands
[1:03:39] they're right in your hands the Lord is
[1:03:42] putting in your hands but I said but I
[1:03:44] promised I promised that I wouldn't do
[1:03:48] it since then I thought you know one
[1:03:50] time David was led right to the very
[1:03:53] side or job was lame and I were king
[1:03:58] Saul was laying job said to him said the
[1:04:00] Lord has delivered him into your hands
[1:04:02] but he said god forbid it odd touches
[1:04:05] him on see you must watch when you make
[1:04:08] a promise and I said I promised God that
[1:04:11] I wouldn't do it so I won't I said
[1:04:13] mother take your children along out no
[1:04:15] I'm not gonna body in my hands you
[1:04:18] couldn't get away if you had to but I'm
[1:04:21] not gonna hurt you belong to the woods
[1:04:23] and they come right back again right
[1:04:24] around I stood there I thought what is
[1:04:28] this a strange thing I'm a nature person
[1:04:32] I watch God in nature the sunset and
[1:04:35] rived that yeah like the barrel the
[1:04:41] death the resurrection again everything
[1:04:42] like the trees how Joel said about
[1:04:45] hiding the grave he keeping a sacred
[1:04:47] place and see the safley the trees and
[1:04:49] go down into the grave of the roots and
[1:04:51] come back up in the spring the
[1:04:52] resurrection everything speaking of life
[1:04:54] and the resurrection is a stood there
[1:04:58] watch them they got closer closer then
[1:05:01] they turn and walked on out in the woods
[1:05:03] and I just stood there just dumbfounded
[1:05:06] and when they went away that Bosch spoke
[1:05:09] down again that sun shining on my back
[1:05:12] do you remember your promise didn't you
[1:05:15] I said yes Lord I remember you if not
[1:05:19] promise I don't let you I can't see you

[1:05:51] been different since then a burden has
