fill your tank with enough fuel so you can make it amen not not just to to take a place in the PE well uh I didn't expect to speak MOA God bless you yeah uh anyway uh I didn't expect to minister this this morning I wasn't even ready so Caleb called me Friday evening because I thought that Caleb was going to preach this morning probably the majority you also thought that because the last Sunday that he preached he said I have so much but I'll continue next Sunday and there I was brother Fel being lazy at home so you know what I did yesterday because Friday we had service so but uh anyway it's good to work for the Lord got up real early and hit the message and I hope we all get pet with with a word this morning and it's good to see your pretty faces this morning this morning the interruption of nature part three and uh let's start with Revelation 6 verse you know I like to teach on Prophecy and like I've told you before I can teach you people but I cannot learn you God bless everybody this on online and those that don't feel well may God send his healing Angel and comfort you at this moment and I beheld when he had opened the six seal and lo there was a great earthquake and the sun became black his sackcloth of hair and the Moon became his blood the Lord add his Blessing to the re the where you may be seated I hope you are not in a hurry I might stay about three or four hours behind the I'm not going to say anymore because get I just said that now God has a a p how he does things he does it by a identifying himself in the scriptures our life here is nothing but a perversion because our life here should have should have been the right life but it was perverted by a natural birth the first life or First Union you were joined in Birth by Nature a natural act a natural human as being associated man and wom together in a sexual Affair which brought your natural life on this Earth and that life that we have is associated with sin and death the woman which is a byproduct was made that way in order to be deceived after the creation Adam had to take a byproduct for a wife now an animal made once a year to reproduce but the woman any time she was made that way C the attributes of God had to be displayed so what was it it was nature associated with death brother Ram said your first husband had ruled over you it was your Nature by a natur birth so naturally you love the world because you are part of the world your desires was by nature to love the world you are a part of then you say brother brother l i don't love the world excuse me excuse me do you don't love the world or throw away your television throw your car throw your throw them away you don't love the world who made all that people of the world so you part of the world I don't care how much Holy Ghost you have the serpent is still inside of you does the serpent in you wants to come to church how did the Apostle Paul say when I would do good evil is present how many times I'm not sping you I'm going to say like my nephew Tim he said when they came from Phoenix Pho he said I I'm only trying to help you I'm only trying to help he's because he's wife is a doctor of the physical but I am a doctor of the spirit amen amen now there there has to be an interruption of nature in all of us and when the six seal was open there was an earthquake oh we're going to hit the the earthquake it's going to be good not because I'm behind this P now I got your attention now I got your good that's what I wanted okay notice but there has to be an interruption of nature in your life that's why ye must be born again you have to separate you have to die to your first husband well you say I'll just divorce him there is no writing a div divorcement no sir he died the nature of the world has to die every SP of him has to die you know why it has to die you have to be re reunited again with your other nature you know your name of your first nature was born and put in a book of life and all your dids were written in it too and everything you've done with that nature was put in a book called The Book of Life now when you were separated from that Union by spiritual death your natural desires did all of us have natural desires and I don't have to go but you the how come the alcoholics or the druggist have those desires how what desires did you have before you became a Christian and are you still tempted and lead us not into temptation but Deliver Us from Evil ah but when you start hearing the word of God you knew there was something better but if that is what she wanted she was pregnated with that kind of pregnation look at the churches now Bible schools a bunch of intellectuals everyone disagreeing with the other different doctrines it is a big mess it is a modern babyon I was talking to to the pastor in Lima Peru he calls me over the phone if I can answer him certain questions I said brother how many churches in Lima Peru he says there's over 120 churches in Peru why well I don't believe what you teach and then they go open the little church and then somebody there doesn't like what they did so on and on especially you go to big cities and there's a bunch uh different churches that wouldn't be bad if there was Fellowship but there's no fellow there's very few that get together so what separates people what happened to their nature much can be said but I'll leave it notice when you you done with that nature it was put in a book called The Book of Life and we know now that there's something better like I said it it's nothing but a modern Babylon when you are separated from your first Union by a spiritual death but now you are remarried again to a new spiritual union of eternal life that germ that was in you at the beginning and found you now your old book is gone with your old Union but now your name has been transferred from the old book When God put it in the sea of forgetfulness and now you stand perfectly before God and now your name is in a new book not in the Book of Life but in the Lamb's Book of Life your new life is in the Lamb's Book of Life your marriage certificate for your true Eternal is from the beginning it takes hold and what happen when your nature is interrupted when Christ Jesus was being formed in the Virgin Mary notice that's when the persecution set in and it's the same way need every one of you Gans [Music] 49 I like to give scripture so you don't think that it's Abraham just telling you this Pro scure my little children of whom I travail in birth again until Christ be formed in you Christ is being formed in you when you are dying how could Christ be forming you if you still have the desires of your old nature that's was Paul telling the Galatians there so when you're dying Christ is being formed in you and Christ is coming to life and watch the persecution say remember when you your old nature remember Danny we like to hang out with all the guys some of them would smoke others drink and some of us did some of that thing that was your old nature ah but I remember when I was working in Los Angeles and I we we bought a car me and [Music] Danny and I was working Tommy I had a quite a few friends but I went to a party a company party where I worked and I I hit one of those big concrete pillars on the freeway I he head on about 2:00 in the morning it's a miracle that I'm behind this pul the guy that was next to me he head hit the wind chill and his head was sticking out he was bleeding and and and and to right now I didn't I didn't even know that I had that accident the motor came inside the car and and my chest hit the steing wheel now that's what they tell me and I was knocked into the freeway when I woke up eight hours later I felt something on the bottom of my feet and I said I was in in fast sleep and I saw somebody dressed in white next to me it was a doctor he had a a pin and he was picking me in the bottom of my feet I said ouch I said what are you doing he said I wanted to know if you were dead or alive I should have been I should have died right there but God had something for me in other words he God was not taking care of me he was taking care of the gift that God gave me the same thing he did to brother too I guess it's happened to it happened to our founding Pastor also we so it probably Mike I don't know if it's happened to you also when we were all in the world we are here thank God for predestination it is the election of God the love that he had for us amen am he didn't save our lives so we can go back he didn't save our Liv so we can go back and be party animals you are a minister even you girls you're ministers ministers means to minister Minister Minister Minister everybody has a need just the biggest responsibilities is like brother said it's the housewife no we come from we used to come from work eight hours work and go home and take a shower and it's suffering and just watch TV or what ever but what about at midnight or one in the morning when the baby is crying who get has to get up and take care of the baby who has to get up and change the diaper you young girls learn you know and if you're a good husband you get up you see the so before you get married think it think it over but some of you girls some of you boys the first girl I want to marry you that's why there are so many divorces but thank God my wife waited 29 years to to find me no 13 15 15 years you already and then you see Chuck Chuck you thank God that you got Paul sit next you know and that's true Tommy you know think think about it don't rush to anything some of you are lucking get to a good husband or guy finds a good girl make a good [Music] wife they just get married and as soon as the wife start getting a little old and her hair hair starts turning white or my need P tee that's why there's so many divorces dieo I'm going to trade her for a new one wow H check your nature check your nature does when you take the wols until death do we no no you stay for for a while and Y you're not get they want another one much can be said but I'm going to stop I don't know why I'm saying it maybe may the Lord wanted me to tell you I've seen many things in my life and I've been preaching this message for over 50 years me and the founding Pastor started the same day he he beat me up up there one of these days my brother amen amen all the Seven Brothers I'm the L of the and you say why I don't know I don't question God no no amen amen okay where was I notice he can say so then watch when you come into the message and when I got into that car accident I I shattered one of my leg or the my ankle and when I hit the freeway I don't know how many teachers they put back here but anyway all my friends friends disappeared no mik I didn't have no money I didn't have no car had no nothing yeah isn't that the world there the if you got something they want to be next to you so that's when we start coming in yeah that's when persecution Starts Now notice the devil goes on on a rampage when Christ is being formed in you and when Christ was being formed in Mary quickly came the king's commandment and now the baby is been formed for a long time along in the womb but this is coming in the last days when the completeness fullness of the godhead when the fullness of Christ is to be manifested among us Revelation 612 again and I beheld when he opened the six seal and L there was a great earthquake black is sackcloth of hair and the Moon became as blood first the sun became black as some people like just to read the message or hear tape you don't need and they say we don't need to go to church to hear nobody I have the messages of brother Bram here tell them to get Revelation 612 and interpret it for you explain it I could tell each and every one of you come up here and explain Revelations 612 how is the Sun going to turn black how is the moon going to turn to blood how are the stars going to fall from Heaven how are the heavens going to roll like a scr you think that and the I don't say this so you think that I know more than all of you I don't know nothing if it wasn't for for a gift that the Lord has given me all the honor and Glory goes to God I wish I could preach like Tommy junor and Danny and others I say there they can really preach I don't have that gift I could never pray likego I got to relax you AIT when I was a pastor of the apost look Hector I thought I could play the guitar like you play it there was this girl that came from this was in City this was this girl that was in and she was playing and I always wanted to play the guitar no my brother tell me he got when he got the first guitar he could he was natural he could play right away so when I was in the Army I bought me a guitar I came home and I thought that I was Chad Atkins Atkins and I was the girl was playing the piano she got the guitar sto the piano and she went she went and sat down and so here I was nobody could could sing with me trying to play the guitar you know what my wife told me God didn't give you that gift was probably you would have stayed in the world and go play in the bars and the that's what I would Rel like you with there amen so amen don't try to be what you not notice so then what I'm trying to say you need all the five Ministry you we could not be where we are if we didn't have Caleb as our pastor we couldn't you know what we know because thank God that we had an apostle who set the word in order we got good evangelists here this and we got I'm not the only teacher you get any one of of these young ministers as Bernie Garcia said this message makes theologians out of everyone yeah let's go on one more let's learn together there's many places where the Bible states that the sun would be darkened but in the scriptures that are in the Bible not one of that say with sack Ezekiel 32 e and and when I shall put thee out I will cover the heaven and make the Stars thereof dark I will cover the sun with a cloud and the moon shall not give her light all the bright lights of heaven will make over thee and set Darkness upon thy lens say the Lord God sack cloth is made of animals especially goat and was the other one go camel it's a coarse fiber something like your burlap saap you know like where you used to buy 100 pounds of beans in it's a it's it's a a p F or a sack that light cannot penetrate and what is sackcloth it's used mainly in morning penitence to mortify the flesh which is an act by which an individual seeks to modify their simple nature of the process of sanctification and during the tribulation the 144,000 are called by Moses and Elijah and they will prophesy for 1,260 days which is three and a half years and when those 144,000 are prophesying they will be closed in sex that's in tribulation so they needed an interruption of nature sin was a nature of the world and the sun was blackened and the prophet Joel was seeing this Joel and I will show wonders in the heaven and in the earth blood and fire and pillers of SM that was verse 30 right the sun shall be turned into darkness and the moon into blood before the great and terrible day of the Lord come Into Darkness I ask the question to you people what Darkness oh we're going to get something here Exodus 20 verse 19 and they said unto Moses speak thou with us and we will hear but let not speak with us L we die and Moses said unto the people fear not for God is come to prove you and that his fear may be before your faes ye sin not look at verse 21 and the people stood AAR off and Moses Drew near unto the deck thick Darkness where God was our brother here from church last last year asked me this question I don't understand that that scripture brother L how can a god of Life be in the darkness you know what it means that God Darkness means that God is in secret places that's right how come when the plague of Darkness see that's why Moses is in in a be there during the Great Tribulation cuz he can blacken the Sun and bring Darkness Moses can and the when the six seal was open there was an earthquake and the sun was blackened but he had sa it it was darkened Moses can do it m did that and it says the moon will turn to blood Moses can do that Darkness he called for darkness in Egypt and the Egyptians had no light but the Israelites had light the israelit had light the world is in darkness right now but we have light we have light to them God is in darkness we know the secret places isn't the rtor going to be a secret noce can they were blinded just like the foolish virgins the foolish virgins give us some of your oil but how could they get oil when the lady oans were blind I Cel thee anoint th eyes with eyes that they thou may see because L went to a complete black out it's we are living in a blackout world and it's the angels look down the and see past the bister to a dark world where there is no law the only light is the light that you have so the children he sing This Little Light of M if they look down God looks down and only the light that we have so Leia went to a complete blackout complete apost apostasy that is ending in the Great Tribulation and Lady oia the only church age on the outside knocking to get in brother venham said we have discovered that the word also teaches an invasion of air eror eror ER the error there is a complete blackout of Truth in the last day as the Lord is getting ready to to come that is why lady oia was destroyed by an earthquake Moses can interrupt nature he already Exodus 10 and the Lord said unto Moses stretch out thy hand toward Heaven that there may be Darkness over the land of Egypt even darkness which may be F which verse is that brother and Moses stretched forth his hand toward heaven and there was a thick Darkness all the land of VI for three days not one another neither Rose from from the place for three days but all the children of had light in their dwelling the only light now is in the bright but once the bride is taken away noce the interruption of nature then the Moon becomes his blood Genesis 114 and God said let there be lights in the firment of the heaven to divide the day from the night let them be for signs and for seasons and for days and years now in the original Hebrew it does not say Seasons he said it will be signals so what signals does a Heavenly Bodies tell us so what signals does the moon send us notice so then and in 1962 the astronomers predicted that the world was going to blow to pieces and the American newspapers made fun of it but brother Venom says something is fixing to happen one of these days and then five planets came in line it had never happened and I predict watch here Paula I predict this has a spiritual application and before God does does anything on Earth he shows it in heaven because it comes from the Supernatural and drops into the natural and is made manifest because we were not made for heaven we were made for the Earth so we know that the moon controls the waters oh the moon controls the people follow me closely you understand where we're going because the moon influen the actions of the people on earth Job 38 31 can thou bind the sweet influences of the pades or lose the V of or Hallelujah can th bring forth a wrath in his season or can thou guide our tourist with his son the a constellation of seven stars but one was missing and the three wise men found they knew where that star was no the observatories or the denomination could not find the star and this is the meero MEO is a constellation he's got TW that he's got 12 planets around 12 St was in the first Bible in the Zodiac another name for and it covers it's 12 because Jacob had 12 sons I've said this before but I want to I said to my mother look Tommy I told my mother how come so many babies are born in this month my mother said because of the Moon look brother julan oh my mother's so crazy when I read the message I found out I was a crazy one not my mother my mother had more Revelation than me it controls the isn't the moon a policeman the takes care of the wers so the wers means the people your character whatever you do is influenced by the moon notice where we're going notice where we're going what influence you is the flowing of an invisible substance that fills the space in the heavens and serving is the medium serving for the transmission of light for of the light way waves and and other forms of radiant energy and it is thought to affect the characters and the actions of people amen Revelation 121 AP apocalypses and there appeared a great wonderand in heaven a woman clothed with a sun and the moon under her feet and upon her head a crown of 12 Stars we know that the moon she reflects light from the sun so then the Lord said let there be lights in the firmament for signals so what type of signal did the solar eclipse that just happened a while ago what was a spiritual application it occurred when the moon got between the Sun and the Earth and the moon It cast a shadow did you see that shadow when when the moon covered the sun there was it's what he did he cast The Shadow and remember we read here on and 121 that there was good things to come we're going to find what was the good things so notice it occurred when the the moon got between the Sun and the Earth and the moon cast a shadow over the Earth it has a spiritual meaning are you people listening the Moon is gradually moving from the Earth but the Moon is a in a perfect distance in position to appear in the SK and it is the same size as the sun How can there be when the sun is 400 times bigger than the moon Isaiah 3026 moreover the light of the Moon shall be is the light of the sun and the light of the sun shall be Sevenfold is the light of seven days and when that alignment comes they call it the diamond effect he leaves the corona visible around the Sun and he looks like a diamond ring watch the spiritual application in the book of Hebrews Isaac could not take possession of everything that Abraham has until he got married now when the bride gets married in heaven she can walk out in full [Music] possession and when she does that the bride makes an exodus follow me closely now here as we turn the corner to finish because she have she has full possession she is clothed with the sun Psalms 19 verse one the heavens declare the glory of God and the firmament CH his handy work which verse was it 191 day and today I speak and night unto night shth knowledge there is no speech nor language for their voice is not heard their line is gone out through all the year and the work to the end of the world and have he said a tabernacle for the Sun is there a from the sun which is as a bridegroom coming out of his chamber and rejoices as a strong man to run and race brother Brandon preaching from the Sun and we see the foolish virgins they go to the moon and they say isn't the moon a reflector of the sun they get the light from the sun and I saw a woman clothed with the sun notice the foolish virgin give us some of your oil but the bride has made an exodus from the Moon to the Sun so the Moon is no longer a reflector so when the foolish virgin wakes up does she wake up too there is no reflector in the moon no more even in that time even then the sun is in darkness Nature has been interrupted Revelation 1212 apocalyps the therefore Rejoice ye heavens and ye that dwell in them woe to the inhabiters of the earth and and of the for for the Devil is come down unto you having a great WRA because he know that he has but a short time and when the dragon saw that he was cast into the Earth he persecuted the woman which brought forth The Man Child and to the woman were given two wings of a great Eagle that she might fly into the Wilderness to a place where she is nourished for a time and have a time from the face of the serpent and the serpent cast out of his mouth water as a flood after the woman that he might CA her to be cre away of the flood and the Earth help the woman and the Earth opened her mouth and swallowed up the flood which the Dragon cast out of his mouth and the dragon was brought with a woman as that is Rome with the woman is a bride as was Roma but the the the bride has already made an exodus from the Moon and he was full of Wrath and the dragon went to make war with the remnant of herity the remnant is the foolish virgin and it is also the 144,000 so when the bride lives the sleeping virgin was put into other Darkness where there was weeping wailing the nation of teeth and at the same time the great Tri ration falls on them so when he opened the six Hill there was a great earthquake and we're going to finish with the earthquake right here St Matthew 241 forgive me for taking your time but but this is life this is life it's not my word it's the word that the bright is like put putting fuel in your spiritual tank nowas and Jesus went out and departed from the temp Temple and his disciples came unto him to show him the buildings of the temple and Jesus said unto them see not all the things for I say unto you there shall not be L here one stone upon another that shall not be thrown down and as he said upon the Mount of Olives the disciples came unto him privately saying tell us when shall these things be and what shall be the sign of thy coming and of the end of the world there have never been so many earthquakes is now the Bible says a there's a great Earth notice as as we're finishing now 1 the Bible talks about this great earthquake the words of Amos who was among the hurtman of tea which she saw concerning Israel in the days ofah king of Judah and in the days of job the son of Joes king of Israel two years before the earthquake it was such a great earthquake that it is there has not been a greater earthquake for 4,000 years in the Bible notice Zechariah 144 and his feet shall stand in that day upon the Mount of Al which is before J Jerusalem on the East and the M ofle shall CLE in the midst therea the East and toward the west and there shall be a very great valley and Heaven to move toward the nor North and half toward the South and you shall flee to the Valley of the mountain for the of the mountain shall reach unto a and you shall flee like as he fled from before the earthquake in the days ofah king of Judah he was a mighty here in Zechariah is talking about that great earthquake okay and there and when the Sixth Seal was open there was a great earthquake Grand some of you might disagree but me and K had a good talk and I know Tommy J is in agreement also that great earthquake that opened the six seal which is that great earthquake I always have thought that that great earthquake is when the bride is picked up and Los Angeles will sing into the Pacific and whoever doesn't agree God bless you but Caleb told me about a vision that your father had that the founding Pastor was in in a plane and and as he was going on this plane he looked down and Los Angeles was seing into the ocean the pl means you know Revelation is symbol so then he was he was he had been raptured I have a booklet here I don't know if anybody in this church has it written by Perry greenry green it is called the earthquake judgment let me read what says here I'm finishing with this after making this statement brother Bram turned to his son and said Billy Billy where are you standing Billy Paul said Billy Paul downtown Los Angeles Angeles brother vham says again where are you standing Billy Paul said Billy Paul in front of the M Company downtown Los Angeles Caleb before he left or talked to me he said he said Uncle would you please explain that to the congregation so how many have walked down Broadway in Los Angeles Angeles California yeah yeah we in the 1950s me and my brother Danny okay so then go ahead I I don't want to see but I I won't tell you if you believe that Los Angeles thinking of Los Angeles Billy Paul just passed away the son of brother Venom so then oh I didn't finish reading yes oh the main part yeah forgive me no no thank you why does he have me here okay noce at this point brother Brena made a prophetic statement Billy he said I may not be here here is where the problem is that that brother Venom missed it so he made a he prophesied and he missed it bad so then brother Brenham said I may may not be here but you will not be an old man until will sing will swim right where you are standing so did bilul die a young man he said you will not be old he was 88 so they said brother Ram Miss so do you see why you need somebody to teach you I mean you don't think that I get the revelations right now but God gives you Revelation when he sits it is time years back we didn't need it now that we're in the end time we need to know these things you will not be an old man how can that be if he was 88 years old and once time is God hidden and revealed in simplicity but you know what in order to know this Revelation you need a key I got the key yeah Caleb got the key got the key Jimmy has a key you need the key what happens when the r come are you going to be lifted an old man you going to be lifted a young man and Billy Paul is going to be there a young man when he living and he sees Los Angeles going down and see the shark is

grateful to be called Christians I'm very proud to be a Malachi 4 five believer very proud to be one of God's sons and uh I'm very very happy to what God has given us today and we're as I said a while ago every time you see brother Abraham behind the desk and I say this because he was behind the desk this this morning there is uh it's a very very great uh opportunity and honor to be able to hear the words that have come out of his mouth I've said this time and time again and uh I I I believe that as I repeat it they say well you shouldn't repeat it maybe you repeat it too many times Well if it's not worth repeating you shouldn't have said it in the first time but I but I say this with all all honor this morning brother Abraham has has forgotten more than I'll ever know he has forgotten a lot more than he has forgotten more then than I'll ever know thank you uh so we're we're grateful to the Lord for for his ministry and and I I don't want you to take this morning like if it was just any other morning because the word of God is so rich more than 50 years of ministering the word you didn't you didn't find a man up here that that became a Christian one day and and he's a preacher the next day but but but this is a man that has been tried by fire and he's been with us in the thick and in the thin they they they asked him one time of some people that had left and they they they said uh would you would you ever leave and he said the only way I would leave was being in a pine box that's that's that is a man that is totally committed so I I I wanted to give him this this morning but but I had tried to find it I had tried to find it but I but I really in reality I even though I knew it I could not find it till till this morning I had someone had sent it to me and uh and and then uh and and then I I I misplaced it and then and and then I couldn't find it again but I found it this and they they asked a a man uh uh we were privileged by God uh to go on a tour this in May right before my papa passed away and what I'm going to show you or or give you is what is on the May Company website May May Company and I stood we stood me and the pastor along with our families we stood outside of the May Company in here in May yes and and and so so this is not something that we I I looked for it and I I I uh they asked the question here and it it it's a by an anonymous person that is writing into the May Company and it says I I I have I have heard I I have hear the same rumor and it says I wonder if you could help I heard a rumor that there was a flood in the May Company building downtown Los Angeles sometimes in the 1970s and and and sharks were supposedly swimming in the basement is there any truth to this and the man answers there is no reference to a flood or sharks of the May Company in Los Angeles Times archives and it was probably an urban legend around the time of the popularity of the film Jaws and there he goes on there are no records of this or a flood in the May building in the [Music] 70s it is used as an Evidence uh of a prophecy made 1520 years earlier however no evidence exists and he says the full prophecy is that part of Los Angeles will fall into the sea this has been reduced over the years to a flood with sharks in the May building okay and so the the the question keeps on coming and again in October n uh of 2017 and it says please did sharks swim swim in the May Company basement during the California earthquake please let me know and the answer is this yes there were sharks swimming in May in the May building's basement this was confirmed by a worker there at the time was sent to all the workers to stay out of the basement due to shark swimming there not something that I imagined but this is something that God had said in in the 1970s I do believe without a shadow of a doubt what our what our what what our senior Elders said tonight that as we go up and the earthquake happens brother Billy Paul is not an old man but I I I just wanted just to to read this for you that in the 1970s brother Billy Paul was not an old man there are people that will try to discredit wherever they can they're they're they're combining the two the swimming of the Sharks and the sinking of Los Angeles let me tell you what the prophet of God said this oh caperna said Jes thou who exalted into heaven will be brought down into hell for if the mighty Works had been done in Sodom and gomorah it have been standing to this day and Sodom and gomorah lays in the bottom of the sea and Caper is in the bottom of the sea now they might not want to believe this but this is the prophet of God to our generation thou City who claims to be the city of the Angel who has exalted yourself into heaven and sent all the dirty filthy things of Fashions and things till even the foreign countries come here to pick up our field and send it away to your fine churches and Steeples and so forth the way you do remember one day you'll be laying at the bottom of the sea your great honeycomb under you right now the wrath of God is boucing right beneath you how much longer he will hold this sand bar hanging out over that when that ocean out yonder a mile deep will slide in there back to the salt and sea it'll be worse than the last days of Pompei repent Los Angeles repent the rest of you and turn to God the hour of his wrath is upon the Earth flee while there's time to flee and come into Christ that's why I said that is the prophecy of none other than the seventh angel people might saying oh no it's not going to happen it's not if it's going to happen you might say Well when is it going to happen that might be another another question but it will happen that is thus sayth the Lord we we we we take with our lives and and uh and in our lives uh we we just if we come to church we come to church but remember one day you're going to wish that those Church doors were open and one day they won't be but while there are open flee to Christ flee to Goan don't flee to this church flee to Christ flee to Goan flee to the word and in honor of brother Billy Paul this you know as you you hear Brother Bram and life story and and brother brandham is is is is is recounting the story and it's not a story it's a vision when he went beyond the curtain of time and he meet Sharon Rose she was she was a a just a little baby and he goes and he meets a young lady didn't recognize her she come to talk to him and she says Mom's waiting for you I'll stay here and I'll be waiting for Brother for for Billy Paul we're gonna ask the Lord Jesus to rest his Gallant Soul greatest witness of the ministry and the life of brother brandom many people might say many things about brother brandom but let me tell you this is the Revelation Upon This Rock I'll build my church and the of Hell cannot Prevail against the church because built upon Revelation you know I when when we had the opportunity to finish when we had the opportunity brother Jerry come on when when we had the opportunity to meet brother brother Billy Paul and Brother Joseph and catch the vision tour catch the vision in in Silver City New Mexico in Silver City I had always thought this and maybe maybe this sounds strange to you but but to me brother brother brother Jacob I had always thought would brother brandham have liked me I don't know maybe maybe it sounds maybe it sounds corny maybe it does but I always thought brother brandham would liked me and when I met the bus there in in the parking lot of Walmart Walmart and he stretched brother Billy Paul stretched forth his hand he stretched forth his hand to me and I I shook his hand and I embraced him I knew brother Brandon would have like now now now maybe that sounds real simplistic but I remember till the day that I die he called me to the platform to show people how brother Brandon prayed for for for people and he placed his hands upon me now now now now you believe this or not but I believe in and I'll take this to to to when H my time goes and I'll take this with me he said put his hands upon me the anointing was out of this world as later on as we we we went to to greet him he tolds me this words you know he was with us now remember that brother Billy Paul was the man besides brother brandham that was able to see the angel of the Lord now and we we we're grateful to that and I'll never I'll never forget the presence and and and the love that they show to us God bless brother Billy Paul's may God bless voice of God the Bram Family Sister Lois and family may may God richly bless them we we have lost uh the greatest witness in this generation of the ministry of brother brandham at the same time he's with his Chum this morning God bless you amen
