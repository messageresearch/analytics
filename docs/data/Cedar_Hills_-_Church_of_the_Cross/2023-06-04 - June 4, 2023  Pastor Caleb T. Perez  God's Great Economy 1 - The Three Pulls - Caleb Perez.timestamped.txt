[28:13] well let's get into the word yeah
[28:16] anybody in a hurry this morning okay
[28:20] all right well we won't have we won't
[28:22] have service this afternoon but but uh
[28:25] let's get and we'll go as far as the
[28:27] Holy Spirit leads us amen
[28:31] the first message on God's Great economy
[28:37] and let's put a subtitle to that the
[28:40] three pools
[28:42] and at first it may seem like
[28:45] what's the correlation between the
[28:48] economy and the three pools
[28:55] and you'll see as it as it unfolds
[29:00] has everything to do with it
[29:04] amen so you can open your Bibles to the
[29:07] book of First Timothy the first chapter
[29:09] and the fourth verse
[29:17] and you have it you can say amen and
[29:19] we're going to go slow today
[29:22] this is not going to be a message that's
[29:25] going to make you jump and Shout
[29:29] but it'll it'll be a message that will
[29:31] that will settle your heart
[29:35] amen is that okay okay because sometimes
[29:38] we want to be on the horse all the time
[29:41] just take your we just take our time
[29:44] today
[29:45] first Timothy 1 4 says neither give he
[29:49] to Fables
[29:50] an endless genealogies
[29:53] which minister questions rather than
[29:57] Godly edifying which is in faith so do
[30:01] presentes
[30:04] since
[30:14] I want to read another version
[30:18] and it says this is
[30:21] nor to give heat to myths
[30:25] genealogies
[30:27] foreign
[30:31] which produced questionings
[30:36] rather than God's economy
[30:40] which is in faith yes and Faith so
[30:43] that's what we're after today is
[30:44] Understanding God's economy
[30:49] you may be seated
[30:52] in the economy of God
[30:56] there are secrets
[30:58] that have been hid from the beginning of
[31:01] time
[31:04] secrets that must be revealed
[31:08] in order for the economy of God
[31:12] to function correctly
[31:16] this is the only way for us to meet the
[31:20] challenges of the day
[31:23] the challenges of the hour
[31:27] there has to be an Administration
[31:31] administration of the economy of God
[31:35] that is suitable for this time
[31:39] and this is what is called the fullness
[31:42] of times
[31:45] keep your Bible's handy because we've
[31:47] got quite a bit of verses to go through
[31:49] today
[31:52] Ephesians the first chapter in The Ninth
[31:54] and the tenth verse
[31:58] nueve having made known unto us the
[32:02] mystery of his will according to his
[32:05] good pleasure which he hath purposed in
[32:08] himself
[32:13] mismo
[32:16] that in the dispensation of the fullness
[32:19] of times
[32:20] he might gather together in one all
[32:24] things in Christ both which are in
[32:26] heaven and which are on earth even in
[32:30] him
[32:40] let me read you another version of this
[32:42] so you can get this
[32:44] and with a view to an Administration
[32:48] that is suitable to the fullness of
[32:52] times
[32:58] once again an Administration that is
[33:01] suitable un Administration
[33:03] to the fullness of times
[33:06] when we talk about the economy
[33:09] the first thing that most people think
[33:11] about is
[33:13] ES
[33:17] money right how is the economy going to
[33:21] understand we think about money
[33:24] talk about the economy of God
[33:27] first thing we think about is going to
[33:30] talk about tithing and offering
[33:33] well that's a that's that's a part of it
[33:36] but the economy of God is
[33:39] so much greater than what we think
[33:44] so then one must understand
[33:48] our pastor he preaches the message the
[33:52] anatomy of economy
[33:57] and you understand the anatomy of
[34:00] economies
[34:02] let's for one moment break down these
[34:05] two words anatomy and economy
[34:10] and that way we can broaden our thoughts
[34:13] as to what God really is telling us
[34:15] today
[34:18] the very word anatomy
[34:22] the very word anatomy is the study of
[34:25] the structure
[34:29] or internal workings of something
[34:35] I want you to get this so can we just
[34:37] and we'll just repeat it in English
[34:41] the study of the structure
[34:46] make sure you didn't leave me hanging
[34:49] this morning
[34:50] the study of the structure
[34:53] or internal workings of something
[34:58] okay that's what the anatomy is
[35:01] so we are going to study
[35:04] the the structure or the internal
[35:09] workings
[35:10] of the economy of God
[35:13] now economy then if they can put that up
[35:17] economy is a system
[35:20] of interrelated production
[35:25] and consumption activities
[35:29] can you repeat that just production
[35:33] and consumption
[35:35] right the economy is based on these two
[35:38] things
[35:39] once again production
[35:42] and consumption
[35:45] activities that ultimately determine the
[35:48] allocation of resources within a group
[35:56] the production and consumption of goods
[35:59] and services
[36:02] as a whole fulfill the needs of those
[36:06] living and operating within it is
[36:15] and an operation is
[36:21] gracias okay so now we're talking about
[36:24] God's Great economy
[36:27] and each one of us
[36:30] when we are functioning correctly in the
[36:34] body of Christ
[36:36] we are a consumer
[36:39] is
[36:41] and we are a producer
[36:44] this is very important to get this is
[36:47] because a lot of times we are so used to
[36:50] consuming
[36:53] gimme gimme gimme
[36:55] Lord give me give me Lord I need this
[36:59] Lord I see that we are not just here to
[37:03] be consumers
[37:05] we are here to be producers
[37:09] but in order to consume
[37:12] there has got to be resources
[37:16] that you can tap into step
[37:20] in the grace in the great economy of God
[37:24] he has resources that we must tap into
[37:30] now we don't want to just be consumers
[37:35] we many times we we find that even in
[37:38] ourselves and everyone can examine
[37:40] himself
[37:43] when we consume but produce nothing
[37:48] our economy is out of balance
[37:52] yes or yes COC we're into balancing our
[37:56] economy now
[37:58] it's it's it's a subject that is so
[38:01] vital in nowadays in the day that we
[38:04] live
[38:06] what the anatomy of economy does
[38:11] it places things in its rightful place
[38:20] so that the economy can operate
[38:23] efficiently
[38:26] we're going to find out how the economy
[38:29] of God must operate
[38:32] not only with us on a personal level
[38:37] but how it is to operate in the Body of
[38:40] Christ
[38:42] you see it's sad to say
[38:46] but people in general don't worry about
[38:49] their spiritual economy
[38:54] of their spiritual economies
[38:57] unless they're natural economy uh gets
[39:02] bad
[39:08] I'm going to say that again we don't
[39:11] really worry about our spiritual economy
[39:14] spiritual until our natural economy
[39:17] turns back
[39:20] when we when we stick our hands on our
[39:23] wall and we don't have uh two dimes
[39:26] then it's like oh Lord what's going on
[39:31] why are we always judging our economy
[39:35] by how much money we have
[39:39] I can't do this and I don't have no
[39:41] money no more
[39:43] No usually because you're robbing God
[39:49] yeah
[39:51] they're like I knew he was gonna go
[39:53] there
[39:55] stick around we're gonna go to a lot of
[39:57] places
[39:59] that's what we're trying to do this
[40:01] morning
[40:03] we're trying to take inventory
[40:06] because there seems to be an imbalance
[40:09] in our lives
[40:11] and there's something inside of us that
[40:13] is crying out
[40:16] I want to be part of God's Great economy
[40:21] yet we're so focused on our own personal
[40:25] economy
[40:28] so in order to understand the anatomy of
[40:31] economy
[40:34] and to study it is this is what second
[40:38] Paul was saying in second Timothy
[40:40] yesterday
[40:42] the second chapter in the 15th verse
[40:45] it's a study to show thyself approved
[40:49] unto God
[40:53] study to show yourself approved
[40:58] oh I'm studying oh Lord really loves me
[41:03] I gotta raise at work
[41:06] I got more money than I know what to do
[41:09] with thank God
[41:11] I've studied it out and I'm doing really
[41:13] good right now
[41:15] but it says a Workman
[41:19] that need is not be ashamed
[41:23] you've got a study study to rightly
[41:27] divide the word of Truth
[41:31] amen I'm going to say it again you have
[41:33] to study
[41:46] are you with me everybody with me I
[41:49] wanna I want you to get this this
[41:51] morning
[41:52] so what are we studying
[41:55] it's the time that we study the anatomy
[41:58] of economies
[42:01] we must learn to to dissect the parts
[42:13] dissect the parts
[42:18] the parts las partes and know how to
[42:22] rightly divide the parts
[42:25] and find the function of each
[42:30] parte now we come to church
[42:33] and turn around and look at your
[42:35] neighbor
[42:36] come to church and and you see them all
[42:39] the time
[42:40] and you say oh well that's brother
[42:42] so-and-so
[42:43] but if you ask that if you can rightly
[42:47] divide
[42:49] how many of you know everything that
[42:52] your brother or sister know how to do
[43:02] well then why aren't we studying it
[43:06] we can study the Bible
[43:09] we can study the message
[43:12] but when do we find time to study each
[43:15] other
[43:18] we are the fourth Bible
[43:23] okay we're we're coming into the economy
[43:26] of God
[43:27] even if you believe that you are part of
[43:30] God's Great economy
[43:39] are you sure about it you're not part of
[43:42] this part keep your hand up
[43:45] all right part of God's Great economy
[43:48] how many believe that your neighbor is
[43:51] part of God's Great economy
[43:54] neighbors are part of the Great economy
[43:58] but we're not studying the economy then
[44:02] we know our
[44:04] goods and bads and in betweens
[44:11] but sometimes we don't even know what
[44:13] we're supposed to be doing
[44:17] now we're talking about God's Great
[44:19] economy
[44:22] we claim them to be the body of Christ
[44:26] under our brother and sister are part of
[44:29] that body investors
[44:31] but there comes a time
[44:33] that even though the body of Christ is
[44:37] one unit
[44:39] it has many parts
[44:43] yeah
[44:45] I want to know what each part the part
[44:47] that each one plays
[44:50] I want to know how to better help other
[44:53] parts
[44:56] can one part be missing and the body
[44:59] still operates
[45:03] sure see
[45:08] somebody that maybe they they don't have
[45:10] a leg
[45:12] they're still alive they function
[45:14] somebody may be missing an eye or an ear
[45:19] whatever it might be and they can still
[45:23] live
[45:23] but they don't function at their Optimum
[45:28] because they're lacking a part that was
[45:32] originally intended
[45:36] to be a part of this body
[45:39] okay then let's see where we're gonna go
[45:42] from here
[45:44] John the fourth chapter and the seventh
[45:47] and then 9th through 11. Juan capitulo
[45:49] cuatro versus
[45:51] when we talk about the economy of God
[45:55] I'm talking about every piece
[46:01] I'm talking about every position
[46:04] I'm talking about every office
[46:07] I'm talking about every member that is a
[46:10] part of the body of Christ okay
[46:15] John chapter 4 and verse 9 verse 7 first
[46:19] we've been reading this the whole time
[46:21] on our other subject
[46:24] but we can't get away from it
[46:28] here's the woman at the well again
[46:31] probably the subject that brother
[46:33] Branham hit on more than anything else
[46:37] there cometh a woman of Samaria to draw
[46:40] water
[46:42] okay now now she was in a condition
[46:47] her economy maybe wasn't so good
[46:51] because she couldn't even come and get
[46:54] water with the rest of the women
[46:58] because of choices bad choices she had
[47:02] made in life
[47:05] verse 9 then the woman of Samaria
[47:09] saith the woman of Samaria unto him how
[47:11] was it that thou being a Jew you asked
[47:14] drink of me
[47:20] now verse 10 Jesus answered and said
[47:23] unto her
[47:24] if thou knew is the gift of God
[47:27] that's what he is and who it is that
[47:29] saith to thee give me to drink
[47:37] that would have asked him and he would
[47:40] have given the Living Water
[47:43] now this is the part that I want to get
[47:46] to win and we've hit on this before
[47:49] but it goes with the message today
[47:53] the woman saith unto him
[47:57] sir thou has nothing to draw with
[48:03] and the well is deep
[48:06] from whence then hast thou that Living
[48:10] Water
[48:11] she's looking at him
[48:14] she's stereotyping him
[48:17] she's putting him with the other men in
[48:21] her life
[48:23] she's telling them you have nothing to
[48:26] draw with
[48:28] in other words
[48:31] no one had ever been able to pull out of
[48:35] her
[48:37] she really was
[48:40] yeah
[48:41] are you with me nobody had ever been
[48:44] able to draw out of her
[48:48] and prove and show that she was a
[48:51] daughter
[48:53] every man in her life before that
[48:57] had failed to draw those things
[49:01] but none of them were Jesus
[49:05] watch what the word draw means things
[49:14] that is used to draw with
[49:18] but draw also means
[49:22] to withdraw money from a bank or Source
[49:28] but draw also means
[49:32] to attract someone
[49:35] in order to bring them to a place or an
[49:38] event
[49:39] now which one do we want to use
[49:43] let's use all of them
[49:45] because you came today
[49:47] because something was drawing you to an
[49:51] event
[49:53] this is an event this morning this is
[49:56] not just church
[49:58] this is an event
[50:01] why did you come because something is
[50:05] drawing you
[50:06] something is telling you you gotta come
[50:10] and have fellowship with your brothers
[50:14] I have something for you
[50:17] so something is drawing us this morning
[50:22] maybe your economy is drawing you is
[50:25] remember
[50:55] they had consumed her
[50:58] they had taken everything out
[51:02] they had stolen things from her
[51:05] you can read in between the lines
[51:09] but not one of them
[51:12] could produce anything for her
[51:18] they were consuming but not producing
[51:22] watch watch as the as the Lord unfolds
[51:25] this today
[51:30] by saying you have nothing to draw with
[51:35] he was putting Jesus in a certain
[51:37] category Jesus and we do that all the
[51:41] time
[51:42] I'm burnt out with church
[51:46] I'm disappointed
[51:48] I don't want to go to church anymore
[51:51] all these excuses
[51:53] because your economy is valency
[52:02] COC
[52:06] you're missing something
[52:08] you're missing a a relationship with
[52:11] Jesus Christ
[52:13] well that church did this to me yeah
[52:17] brother and sister in the church
[52:18] yesterday
[52:20] you have nothing to draw with
[52:23] and then you ask of me give me the drink
[52:28] what is it
[52:30] they have income in contact
[52:33] with Jesus Christ
[52:36] and he's talking to her
[52:38] but as he's talking to her
[52:42] she's contacting her spirit
[52:46] okay now I want to ask you a question
[52:49] have you ever talked to each other
[52:53] but but contact each other's spirits
[53:00] amigo
[53:10] Good Hunter
[53:14] what else do you know so
[53:17] yesterday a year the young people had a
[53:21] had a good good meeting
[53:27] I need a
[53:30] so in this meeting yesterday for the
[53:32] young people
[53:35] get one of the microphones
[53:38] look at this
[53:41] somebody
[53:45] and in this in this meeting
[53:47] our young people were asked the question
[53:50] is can you just real quick to say just
[53:54] you brother asked the question that you
[53:56] asked them
[53:57] I am
[54:01] so we asked them the question is
[54:07] and a lot of people will say well I am
[54:10] I'm a barber I'm a student I'm this or
[54:12] that
[54:15] but we had them not tell us what they do
[54:20] but who they are okay
[54:24] not what you do no Lucas
[54:27] you might be a construction worker
[54:30] that's what you do it's not who you are
[54:36] I I know you're part of your identity is
[54:40] is what you go with I understand that
[54:42] yes but I want to go deeper than just
[54:44] that's who he is
[54:49] so they started getting the point and
[54:51] they'd stand up
[54:53] and it was like popcorn going off
[54:57] we'll hand it out to one of them let's
[55:00] see what they were saying I I anybody
[55:02] want to know what the young people were
[55:03] saying yes
[55:05] I am a servant of the most high God and
[55:07] worship is what I'm all about
[55:11] and that's what I'd be
[55:13] yes so that's what I'd be yes
[55:17] who else
[55:21] I'm a daughter of the most high King and
[55:24] I'm a psalmist for his people and I live
[55:26] to praise His name and that's what I'd
[55:28] be about that's what I'd be about yes
[55:33] which other one sister Genesis
[55:39] I'm Genesis and I was there
[55:42] oh I'm Genesis and I was there from the
[55:45] beginning
[55:46] even her name says it all huh come on
[55:50] give me a couple more of the brothers
[55:51] here
[55:56] on mouthpiece for God and I'm about to
[55:59] be storing a feature like
[56:01] I'd be so eternal life
[56:05] come on give me another one
[56:14] [Music]
[56:16] I will praise the Lord and give him all
[56:19] my wish that's what I'd be about
[56:22] that's who you be
[56:25] that's who she be one more
[56:34] I am proud
[56:37] I am
[56:39] who I am that Jesus Christ
[56:43] paid the penalty of death for us come
[56:46] across for us all right
[56:48] that's who I'd be we are the purchase of
[56:53] his blood
[56:56] he's contacting her spirit
[56:59] which is something that we should learn
[57:01] to do
[57:03] you gotta contact the spirit
[57:06] it is not about just where you're going
[57:08] on vacation
[57:10] and what you've been doing lately you
[57:13] know nothing about them all we know know
[57:16] is what each other what each one of us
[57:18] likes to do for entertainment
[57:24] hello everybody
[57:26] we can tell you where everybody's been
[57:28] around
[57:31] but what about the real you and the real
[57:34] me
[57:36] sit down and have a conversation with
[57:39] each other
[57:41] contact each other's spirits
[57:45] and get to know one another
[57:48] why are we doing that
[57:50] because our economy is out of balance
[57:54] we don't even know what parts are are
[57:57] there
[57:58] I want to know this morning
[58:01] that's what he's trying to show us
[58:04] people love to consume consume consume
[58:08] and never want to produce anything
[58:12] and our economy is out of whack
[58:18] the economy is like a computer
[58:22] it consists of two basic systems
[58:26] hardware and software Hardware so you
[58:30] can understand the economy Wellington
[58:31] they're like onomia but let's focus here
[58:33] on the hardware for a moment
[58:36] the hardware of the economy
[58:39] it's divided into two basic types
[58:44] are you ready
[58:47] inputs
[58:55] and outputs
[58:58] inputs in the economy
[59:01] are called resources
[59:04] yeah yeah all right again
[59:08] are usually called products
[59:12] goods or services
[59:15] and under inputs
[59:18] people always want to know what they're
[59:21] going to received
[59:24] why do I get out of it
[59:28] ask anybody for a favor nowadays
[59:33] what am I going to get out of it
[59:37] satisfaction that you help somebody
[59:51] what about your output yeah
[59:54] is your input and your output is it
[59:58] balanced
[1:00:02] oh I think this is a good subject what
[1:00:06] does the lord gave it to us
[1:00:09] what products are you producing
[1:00:12] what's goods or services are you
[1:00:15] producing
[1:00:17] it's like when when people receive the
[1:00:19] Holy Ghost
[1:00:21] I got the Holy Ghost
[1:00:25] it's not just to say I got the holy
[1:00:28] ghosts
[1:00:29] it's not to say I got the Holy Ghost so
[1:00:32] now I'm going to heaven
[1:00:35] that's not the purpose of why it was
[1:00:37] given
[1:00:39] the holy ghost coming into you
[1:00:42] is the input yes but now it wants to
[1:00:47] produce a product
[1:00:50] it's the output
[1:00:53] what is it what's coming forth God
[1:00:57] ah let's let's find out what's coming
[1:00:59] forth from our lives
[1:01:03] because we're always looking at it at
[1:01:05] somebody else
[1:01:09] I
[1:01:23] ain't even gonna get into that
[1:01:27] you receive the holy ghosts
[1:01:32] Jesus said the same works that I do that
[1:01:36] means
[1:01:37] shall you do also
[1:01:39] and Greater Works than these shall you
[1:01:43] do
[1:01:45] but you cannot I mean you gotta Focus
[1:01:47] first of all
[1:01:49] and you gotta find out who you are
[1:01:52] you'll never know who your neighbor is
[1:01:55] not your brother's sister until first
[1:01:59] you find out who you are
[1:02:01] what part of the economy you're playing
[1:02:06] I remember when my mother passed away
[1:02:08] yeah
[1:02:15] she was a prayer Warrior
[1:02:18] she would be in the closet at two three
[1:02:21] in the morning
[1:02:26] she's gone now
[1:02:28] who's going to take her place
[1:02:32] because the body still needs people
[1:02:35] prayer warriors
[1:02:40] hello
[1:02:43] well we don't need preachers no more the
[1:02:45] body still needs preachers
[1:02:49] to get into that in a moment
[1:02:52] not throwing at anybody I'm not against
[1:02:55] any brothers
[1:02:57] trying to do is
[1:03:00] there's more to the economy of God than
[1:03:03] we are that we are saying
[1:03:07] notice this now in the body of Christ
[1:03:12] there's a perfect economy
[1:03:15] and when you receive input it
[1:03:19] causes you to
[1:03:23] is
[1:03:42] become somebody else's inputs
[1:03:47] are you with me all right now what are
[1:03:51] you doing with what you are what the
[1:03:52] input is
[1:03:54] and only those
[1:03:57] that can understand
[1:03:59] they realize that they are part of this
[1:04:03] great economy
[1:04:05] they're the only ones that can function
[1:04:08] correctly in the body
[1:04:12] second Timothy 3 7 says
[1:04:16] ever learning is
[1:04:19] my God it's hot up here
[1:04:22] stepping on
[1:04:26] we need a little Danny going on
[1:04:29] is it hot out there
[1:04:31] kind of
[1:04:35] we were
[1:04:38] we were in Africa Islam was in Africa
[1:04:41] there was all these Kings sitting in
[1:04:43] front
[1:04:45] and there was this man is
[1:04:48] that was behind one of the Kings
[1:04:51] it was so hot that day
[1:04:54] he had this big old umbrella huge
[1:04:59] and he's behind the king his King
[1:05:02] holding that yes
[1:05:05] and he you should have seen him he was
[1:05:08] like this is
[1:05:11] he was trying to keep it together
[1:05:24] this was two hours in yeah yeah
[1:05:27] I was tired just looking at him
[1:05:32] I almost felt like going up and helping
[1:05:34] him
[1:05:38] and then all of a sudden I guess he
[1:05:41] forgot for a moment that that he was
[1:05:43] doing this for his kingdom
[1:05:46] but all of a sudden he gets you can tell
[1:05:49] the light bulb turns on
[1:05:51] people are watching
[1:05:58] six hours later
[1:06:00] he's still like a rock
[1:06:03] not even moving I said man what a lesson
[1:06:08] talk about digging deep
[1:06:11] that's what we got to do we gotta dig a
[1:06:13] Little Deeper
[1:06:15] I know this is not ever learning the
[1:06:18] Bible says
[1:06:20] learning and learning and hearing and
[1:06:22] learning
[1:06:25] that's why
[1:06:29] we can read the whole Bible over and
[1:06:31] over and over again
[1:06:33] listen to every message of the brother
[1:06:36] Branham over and over again
[1:06:38] we are ever learning
[1:06:41] ever receiving input is
[1:06:45] but never coming to the knowledge of the
[1:06:48] truth
[1:06:50] never able to produce
[1:07:00] that's my question to people
[1:07:03] I want to be able to produce
[1:07:07] but for me to do that
[1:07:10] you gotta know all my resources
[1:07:15] I gotta know all the resources that God
[1:07:18] has in his economy
[1:07:21] when somebody says I accept the prophet
[1:07:24] but not not not a passage that's
[1:07:28] valency
[1:07:36] am I because he never took pastors away
[1:07:39] from his economy works
[1:07:44] together
[1:07:47] I received the pastor but I I don't
[1:07:50] receive the evangelists
[1:07:52] I don't want that the Apostle or or the
[1:07:55] prophet or the oh okay
[1:07:58] I'll have the pastor your economy is
[1:08:02] unbalanced economies
[1:08:05] are we understanding this this morning
[1:08:07] we're unbalanced
[1:08:10] God's economy
[1:08:16] there are people that will fulfill every
[1:08:18] word
[1:08:25] oh here we come
[1:08:27] and we find that we're ever learning
[1:08:31] never able to produce the out the right
[1:08:34] output appropia
[1:08:39] watch the prophet in the message the
[1:08:42] India report report
[1:08:46] closely because this tells you this
[1:08:48] gives you pieces
[1:08:50] Christ had the spirit
[1:08:53] medida
[1:08:57] that was Christo the whole ocean
[1:09:03] all right
[1:09:05] he said that was Christ the whole ocean
[1:09:10] this little gift that's in your servant
[1:09:12] here is
[1:09:15] brother is just a little drop out of the
[1:09:18] ocean
[1:09:29] that's in the entire ocean is
[1:09:33] in the little spoon
[1:09:37] it's in each little drop is
[1:09:41] but not as much
[1:09:44] here we go now and so our Ministries
[1:09:51] and so our Ministries ministerios
[1:09:57] come on
[1:09:59] are the chemicals
[1:10:02] that's made up que component in the
[1:10:06] great economy of God
[1:10:12] this is what he's this is what the
[1:10:14] prophet is saying
[1:10:15] so then how can the chemists
[1:10:19] produce what he wants to produce
[1:10:22] if he don't have all the chemicals
[1:10:26] our Ministries
[1:10:29] are these chemicals
[1:10:31] of the economy of God now
[1:10:36] we got to be able to have this
[1:10:39] got to have the apostles
[1:10:42] that's the chemical
[1:10:45] that's an anointing
[1:10:49] you got to get this for later on that's
[1:10:51] an anointing that's an office
[1:10:56] a pastor Pastor is another that's
[1:10:59] another anointing
[1:11:01] that's an office
[1:11:03] it is another chemical
[1:11:05] when you put a couple of chemicals
[1:11:08] different chemicals together
[1:11:10] I'm going to say it again when you put a
[1:11:13] couple of different chemicals
[1:11:25] what is going to come foreign
[1:11:31] foreign
[1:12:14] yes
[1:12:15] but there's still chemicals here
[1:12:18] oh yeah
[1:12:21] I love brother Branham yes
[1:12:23] that's the fountain where the message
[1:12:26] came from
[1:12:29] a fountain is separated
[1:12:33] and it brought a chemical of Apostles
[1:12:36] not a chemical of pastors
[1:12:41] it came from one rockete
[1:12:45] what is it producing
[1:12:47] there's more that still needs to be
[1:12:51] produced
[1:12:53] I'm not stuck back there
[1:12:56] this is the present now
[1:12:59] you've got to deal with what we have
[1:13:03] we have been given the resources that
[1:13:06] are needed
[1:13:11] David could not build the temple
[1:13:18] because of all the blood he had shared
[1:13:23] but his son
[1:13:27] built the temple
[1:13:31] but Solomon or let me let me take that
[1:13:34] back but David pero David left all the
[1:13:38] resources
[1:13:39] so that Solomon could build the
[1:13:42] temporary
[1:13:46] I'm gonna say it again we have been left
[1:13:50] the chemicals
[1:13:53] that it's gonna take to finish the job
[1:13:58] I don't know if you believe me or not
[1:14:00] but that's what I believe
[1:14:02] you have the resources but we gotta know
[1:14:07] and let God put it together the way he
[1:14:09] wanted
[1:14:12] God will use those chemicals the way he
[1:14:15] wants
[1:14:17] but all together
[1:14:19] it's more of it than it was in the one
[1:14:22] esmas
[1:14:24] fullness of the god the fullness of God
[1:14:28] in his church Iglesia
[1:14:32] I'm going to say it again the fullness
[1:14:34] of God in his church
[1:14:38] that is God's economy is
[1:14:43] the stoppers can I go for a little bit
[1:14:52] I tried the message and it didn't work
[1:15:12] because you don't have the right mixture
[1:15:21] I'm going to say it again you don't have
[1:15:22] the right mixture is
[1:15:28] oh you're gonna find out you do
[1:15:32] that's not too late
[1:15:36] I'm gonna do my own thing
[1:15:39] God bless you again
[1:15:42] but you'll be like
[1:15:46] you'll find out what your output is
[1:15:50] not what the economy of God
[1:15:59] you see
[1:16:01] do you see now why even the economies in
[1:16:04] the home
[1:16:07] are not operating at its best optimo
[1:16:12] because the chemicals don't mix right
[1:16:17] that man don't tell me what to do is
[1:16:20] I'm My Own persona
[1:16:27] wow
[1:16:28] you're tough
[1:16:30] what are they
[1:16:33] good job
[1:16:37] hello everybody
[1:16:39] the economy is in the homes
[1:16:45] there's no respect between the husband
[1:16:47] and the wife
[1:16:49] no respect from the children to the
[1:16:52] husbands
[1:16:54] worse and worse and what is the family
[1:16:58] producing is
[1:17:01] you fill in the blanks
[1:17:03] you know what you're what your family is
[1:17:05] producing
[1:17:06] families let's turn the corner
[1:17:16] in order to really understand the
[1:17:18] anatomy of economy
[1:17:21] one must understand the purpose
[1:17:25] of the three pools
[1:17:29] what is the pool
[1:17:31] it's to draw is
[1:17:34] come on now you're the woman at the well
[1:17:37] yeah you have nothing to draw with
[1:17:40] nothing you knew the gift of God that
[1:17:43] was before you
[1:17:44] could be asking of me for a drink of
[1:17:47] water
[1:17:48] after a while it was give me of that
[1:17:51] water yes
[1:17:55] there's a purpose of understanding the
[1:17:58] economy
[1:18:01] understanding the three pools
[1:18:04] you ready to go with me on this at least
[1:18:06] Sunday school we're learning here this
[1:18:08] morning
[1:18:10] the three pools
[1:18:13] are three stages of ministry
[1:18:17] you're writing notes down you should
[1:18:19] know this already
[1:18:21] but three pools is three stages of
[1:18:23] ministry
[1:18:26] how many know that Noah had three pools
[1:18:31] yeah okay Moses
[1:18:34] three pools Jesus Jesus three pools
[1:18:38] brother Branham three pools and we know
[1:18:42] you can continue on but let's let's just
[1:18:45] focus on this for a moment
[1:18:47] we know that Moses have three pools
[1:18:51] and and in the book of Deuteronomy the
[1:18:54] 18th chapter and the 15th verse
[1:18:59] says this day
[1:19:01] 1815.
[1:19:02] it says the Lord thy God will raise up
[1:19:06] unto thee a prophet Prophet
[1:19:09] from the midst of thee of thy brethren
[1:19:14] yo
[1:19:16] of thy Brethren remember that part of
[1:19:20] thy Brethren
[1:19:22] like Revelations
[1:19:24] don't worship me
[1:19:28] like unto me unto him
[1:19:36] brother Brown says Jesus
[1:19:38] was the word
[1:19:41] and he he was the prophet that Moses
[1:19:45] spoke
[1:19:47] now we also understand
[1:19:51] that all scripture is compounded
[1:19:54] so in order to understand this Prophet
[1:19:59] you've got to understand Moses
[1:20:03] yes or yes I think I'm losing you
[1:20:07] if you're sleepy you need to go home
[1:20:10] make memes
[1:20:12] get up but just be real real quiet and
[1:20:15] you can leave okay
[1:20:16] you didn't have a good night you just
[1:20:18] never know
[1:20:20] but just be very quiet okay
[1:20:24] you want to stay there praise the Lord
[1:20:28] I'm not trying to be funny I'm saying it
[1:20:31] I really mean that yeah
[1:20:34] in order to understand this Prophet
[1:20:38] you have to understand Moses
[1:20:40] and when God calls a man
[1:20:44] he equips the man to do the job
[1:20:48] even though the man doesn't see all that
[1:20:51] he's equipped with mismo
[1:20:56] he gives him all the resources
[1:20:59] that he'll need to do the job
[1:21:03] God gives him his Spirit
[1:21:07] he gives him his word
[1:21:11] he gives him gifts and signs and wonders
[1:21:16] he gives him the ministry that will help
[1:21:18] him
[1:21:20] and all the people that are
[1:22:09] he goes to deliver them
[1:22:12] and he goes to put all those signs and
[1:22:15] wonders into actions
[1:22:18] he was testing it out over here
[1:22:22] now it's time to go let's say it's go
[1:22:26] time okay become friends Pharaoh
[1:22:31] this is the 10 Flags yes putting into
[1:22:36] action all the signs and wonders that
[1:22:38] the Lord said
[1:22:41] his last message
[1:22:43] was then to get the people behind the
[1:22:47] blood
[1:22:48] we know that the death angels
[1:22:53] and they would receive Mercy
[1:22:56] now Moses is on his road to the promised
[1:22:59] land
[1:23:01] if you want to read it you can just mark
[1:23:04] it down and read it at home Exodus
[1:23:06] chapter 4 verse 1 through 9.
[1:23:11] Moses and the Lord's telling him the
[1:23:14] first sign and the second sign
[1:23:18] but we find out in this scripture
[1:23:21] that the voice of the foreign
[1:23:42] come on come on nobody
[1:23:46] oh come on
[1:23:52] it's before the burning bush what does
[1:23:55] he do after that yeah
[1:23:58] the hand right
[1:24:00] fix his hand in his bosom pulls it out
[1:24:03] and it's leprous
[1:24:05] puts it back in and it's clean it's
[1:24:08] Olympia all right now then he says that
[1:24:11] then and the Bible says if they will not
[1:24:14] hear the voice of the first signs
[1:24:19] or that of the latter
[1:24:22] signal then take the water
[1:24:25] and pour it on the ground
[1:24:28] and it'll become blood
[1:24:30] okay now we're seeing all these things
[1:24:33] the problem is this this is what I'm
[1:24:38] telling you about about God's economy
[1:24:42] gotta know where you are dwelling where
[1:24:45] you live today
[1:24:48] this is important now it is important if
[1:24:51] you have to pinch yourself pinch
[1:24:53] yourself
[1:24:54] this is understanding now the economy of
[1:24:57] God
[1:24:59] because if we don't go far enough
[1:25:02] we stay stuck at a certain stage of
[1:25:05] ministry
[1:25:11] God is doing in our time
[1:25:15] under the first pool
[1:25:19] or the voice of the first signal
[1:25:23] the rod was turned into a serpent
[1:25:28] and when the action came it was time to
[1:25:32] throw it down
[1:25:34] it became a serpent he said praise God
[1:25:38] but all of a sudden something else
[1:25:41] happens
[1:25:52] the thing about it is
[1:25:57] it can be imitated
[1:26:01] okay come on now I need I need you get
[1:26:03] you to get it get give me your undivided
[1:26:06] attention
[1:26:07] under the first pool
[1:26:11] it can be imitated
[1:26:16] and that's where people want to stay
[1:26:18] yeah
[1:26:22] you'll find out in a moment why is
[1:26:26] but when the reality came
[1:26:29] his Rod swallowed up the two other rods
[1:26:33] or serpents
[1:26:36] and now those serpents we're now in
[1:26:40] Moses
[1:26:43] oh there's something good now now watch
[1:26:45] us now under the second part
[1:26:48] was the cleansing of the heart
[1:26:52] now you're gonna begin to see a prophet
[1:26:56] like unto Moses
[1:26:58] when he stuck his hand in his heart
[1:27:02] and he pulls it out it is now a Lapras
[1:27:06] hand
[1:27:08] leprosy is a type of sin
[1:27:11] and the same way the prophet of the age
[1:27:18] was when he could discern the heart
[1:27:22] pull out the sin is
[1:27:27] uh-oh are you with me going on now I
[1:27:30] want you to come with me here now
[1:27:32] so let's stop for a moment because we
[1:27:35] want you to really get this too
[1:27:39] the very day when the messenger
[1:27:42] when he begins to declare his message
[1:27:46] then he says this is in the message
[1:27:49] anointed ones at the end times
[1:27:52] he said the first poll was healing
[1:27:57] and everybody wants to stay in the first
[1:28:00] pool
[1:28:01] but it can be imitated
[1:28:05] e
[1:28:18] the second pool was prophesied
[1:28:24] but the third pool
[1:28:26] was the opening of the word
[1:28:30] the Mysteries were to be revealed
[1:28:36] no more
[1:28:38] he said there is no more higher order
[1:28:43] to reveal the word Prophets
[1:28:48] but the only way the prophet can be
[1:28:52] Vindicated
[1:28:54] is by the words okay and remember the
[1:28:58] third pool
[1:29:00] was the opening of them Seven Seals
[1:29:04] to reveal the hidden truth
[1:29:07] [Applause]
[1:29:08] that's been sealed in the word
[1:29:11] and then he says do you see it
[1:29:16] okay
[1:29:24] oh I asked the Lord for a good job
[1:29:34] is that the biggest thing you've asked
[1:29:35] foreign
[1:29:44] [Applause]
[1:29:49] are you satisfied there that's that is
[1:29:53] 20 years later I remember the Lord
[1:29:56] healed me from this praise the Lord
[1:29:59] have you grown from that
[1:30:02] because the greatest healing foreign
[1:30:12] come on now we we got to go a little
[1:30:14] farther
[1:30:15] yeah okay watch what he says do you see
[1:30:19] it
[1:30:20] we have to understand God's Great
[1:30:22] economy
[1:30:24] you have to know the message
[1:30:28] you have to know the output and the
[1:30:32] output is
[1:30:34] the responsibility it's not
[1:30:37] responsibility that the input is giving
[1:30:39] you okay
[1:30:45] no I think a couple of people got it
[1:30:49] local do people not want to go any
[1:30:52] further
[1:30:55] because it took a sacrifice to get where
[1:30:58] you're at
[1:31:00] but people don't want to go any farther
[1:31:04] because they're not willing to pay a
[1:31:07] greater sacrifice
[1:31:10] come on church I want you to get this
[1:31:12] though it's too easy just sitting there
[1:31:15] and hearing a message
[1:31:17] but when the message comes inside
[1:31:21] begins to give you a responsibility
[1:31:26] your part is in the body of Christ
[1:31:35] are you willing to pay a greater price
[1:31:40] come on it's a challenge this morning
[1:31:48] well
[1:31:49] I believe
[1:31:52] the devil believes
[1:31:59] I'm a Believer brother
[1:32:01] the Devil is a Believer too
[1:32:07] the Bible says that Satan believes that
[1:32:09] God is one too and he trembles
[1:32:12] it's not enough just to say I'm a
[1:32:15] Believer
[1:32:17] come on come on go with me on this we
[1:32:20] got to go a little farther now yeah
[1:32:24] we take and we keep the first pool
[1:32:28] his body we're always going to need
[1:32:30] healing
[1:32:33] but I also want pools
[1:32:37] because I want the leprosy of my heart
[1:32:40] to be taken away
[1:32:46] pull out the leprosy
[1:32:49] so that when the hand goes in again
[1:32:55] church what do you want
[1:33:01] but I want the third now too
[1:33:04] because I don't want just things that
[1:33:06] are imitated
[1:33:08] imitate number one
[1:33:11] number two yeah but you cannot imitate
[1:33:15] the word
[1:33:18] you can't say and cannot imitate the
[1:33:21] third pool
[1:33:24] why it is the Revelation
[1:33:26] it is the unfolding the complete
[1:33:31] unfolding
[1:33:32] of the economy of God
[1:33:37] seven Thunders uttered
[1:33:40] what was it thundering I don't know are
[1:33:44] you paying attention
[1:33:48] I'm not wow
[1:33:50] and people will say ah don't get into
[1:33:52] the Thunders that that's somewhere
[1:33:53] sometime later
[1:33:56] I like the way our founding Pastor would
[1:33:59] say
[1:34:00] when they would say oh the Thunder's
[1:34:03] revealed or not
[1:34:05] he would say they are revealing and this
[1:34:09] is
[1:34:11] little at a time it's an unfolding
[1:34:16] but not somewhere where it was written
[1:34:20] but he said I would ride it in the
[1:34:23] hearts of the Believers
[1:34:27] unfolding a little at a time
[1:34:32] that's great economy of God
[1:34:36] and I have like 10 minutes
[1:34:40] in 15 20 30 minutes yes
[1:34:44] don't get all sad on me right away
[1:34:46] foreign
[1:34:48] okay let's keep let's keep going on this
[1:34:51] now
[1:34:52] the three pools of brother Branham
[1:34:55] he said they were symbolized in Little
[1:34:57] Birds
[1:35:00] I don't know if you have that or not but
[1:35:02] little birds or is that right amen and
[1:35:05] under this first pool
[1:35:07] his hand would change colors
[1:35:12] you could tell if it was a bacterial or
[1:35:14] viral infection
[1:35:17] right right it was the it was the first
[1:35:20] it was praying for the sick
[1:35:21] and as long as it's first pool
[1:35:26] everybody loves you
[1:35:29] brother Branham prophet of them
[1:35:37] look at this
[1:35:43] Jesus Jesus as long as he was healing
[1:35:46] their sins
[1:35:52] oh Jesus of Nazareth
[1:35:55] he is the king
[1:35:57] yes let's take the clothes and just put
[1:36:00] it on the floor
[1:36:02] it didn't even take one week later
[1:36:06] that the same ones that had put their
[1:36:09] clothes down
[1:36:10] and was hailing King of the Jews
[1:36:14] they were the same ones that were saying
[1:36:17] crucified blasphemy
[1:36:22] under first pool
[1:36:24] everybody
[1:36:27] Church guns people love
[1:36:30] them love the brother
[1:36:33] but then from the little birds that came
[1:36:35] into doves
[1:36:38] and then people began to get a little
[1:36:40] nervous
[1:36:42] because under second pool
[1:36:46] economy of God is
[1:36:48] under second pool
[1:36:51] Spirit would lead him
[1:36:53] and now he knew the intents of the Earth
[1:37:02] in such in such a place
[1:37:04] this is going on and this is where
[1:37:07] you're from
[1:37:07] and this is this is who you're married
[1:37:10] to is you work over here and and what
[1:37:13] was he doing
[1:37:15] to discern the hearts
[1:37:18] but you have a hidden
[1:37:22] leprosy in your heart the moment he
[1:37:26] began to to open up the heart
[1:37:30] corazones
[1:37:32] that's right yes people began leaving
[1:37:36] why because they had sin in their hearts
[1:37:39] they didn't want that to be opened up
[1:37:44] they were happy with healing of their
[1:37:46] bodies
[1:37:51] I don't want no one to know about this
[1:37:54] oh that man knows too many things
[1:37:57] they stopped going
[1:37:59] and all of a sudden there weren't as
[1:38:02] many followers
[1:38:05] um
[1:38:12] when the lamb pulls back the seals
[1:38:17] where's the lamb pulling the seals back
[1:38:20] from they don't understand
[1:38:22] he found a man from Kentucky
[1:38:25] he could sit in his throne
[1:38:28] from there began to speak
[1:38:36] the Sills
[1:38:40] these Revelations began to come back
[1:38:43] we love you brother Brandon yeah but all
[1:38:47] of a sudden they began to hear
[1:38:49] things that they had never heard before
[1:38:53] this is the first seal is
[1:38:59] the sixth what was he doing it was a
[1:39:02] land open in the field
[1:39:04] but now ahora as in the times of Jesus
[1:39:08] when Jesus said unless you eat my flesh
[1:39:20] I don't know about that
[1:39:22] he's putting too much on himself
[1:39:26] he was good under one or two pools
[1:39:31] now he wants us to eat his flesh and
[1:39:33] drink it
[1:39:37] they couldn't go to the third because
[1:39:39] they were too carnal nobody else
[1:39:42] we can never go any farther with God as
[1:39:45] long as we stay in our carnal conditions
[1:39:49] not only did the people leave
[1:39:53] but 70 of his disciples
[1:39:58] all because
[1:40:05] no
[1:40:06] my church don't teach that
[1:40:09] the rabbi didn't teach us that
[1:40:12] Christian teachers
[1:40:15] wonderful
[1:40:17] but God was an oldies
[1:40:21] the economy of God
[1:40:24] was how he would dispense or distribute
[1:40:28] himself amongst human beings
[1:40:33] the economy of God
[1:40:36] produce the man the god man
[1:40:40] but from that one man
[1:40:44] you would come for sons and daughters
[1:40:48] that the economy of God would grow
[1:40:54] come on hot let me tell you we've got to
[1:40:57] know we are in that economy
[1:41:00] when you get them to the third pool
[1:41:03] there's there's so much fighting about
[1:41:06] all these things
[1:41:08] that third pool that's brother Branham
[1:41:11] another say we have the third pool
[1:41:14] and you have people over here
[1:41:17] and then you have people over here and
[1:41:20] there's no balance
[1:41:22] the economy is out of balance
[1:42:06] Glory oh you have this fighting
[1:42:09] believes it like this is
[1:42:15] no
[1:42:23] when the seal is broken open it starts
[1:42:27] the war
[1:42:29] it starts a scriptural War
[1:42:32] oh prove it to me I'll prove it to you
[1:42:36] well I've got this quote this quote
[1:42:40] as much as we don't like it
[1:42:43] it's got to be like that
[1:42:45] there's a purpose behind that I am
[1:42:51] now I'm not saying for you to go out and
[1:42:53] start fighting with everybody
[1:42:58] but you stand for the word
[1:43:01] and that's why our founding Pastor would
[1:43:03] say this is when I hear people saying oh
[1:43:06] we got the third pool
[1:43:08] he said ask them a simple question
[1:43:12] what part of the third floor
[1:43:18] that's simple because the third pool has
[1:43:21] three parts forget this
[1:43:25] parties right so which part is it
[1:43:31] I think I better stop huh
[1:43:33] all right let me just go just for a
[1:43:35] little bit more
[1:43:36] thank you for hearing me on
[1:43:42] three parts of the third pool
[1:43:44] and here you have people struggling
[1:43:48] brother Brown says
[1:43:51] something happened yesterday
[1:43:56] okay come on these are the three parts
[1:43:58] this is God's economy
[1:44:04] what happened yesterday
[1:44:08] right when the when the seventh seal was
[1:44:11] open
[1:44:13] third pool
[1:44:15] reports of that seven seal or the third
[1:44:17] three parts of the third pool
[1:44:19] together okay
[1:44:23] what happened yesterday
[1:44:29] that's right
[1:44:31] it was the opening of six Hills
[1:44:34] the book of redemption it was the whole

[1:45:49] that was yesterday yes something
[1:45:52] happened today
[1:45:55] what happened today
[1:45:57] the scene was said we heard a good
[1:46:01] message right on Sunday
[1:46:02] my brother was talking about the scene
[1:46:05] because when the seventh seal was open
[1:46:09] it was silence silencio
[1:46:14] nothing moves
[1:46:18] not a
[1:46:20] symbolo just a scene
[1:46:24] nothing going on
[1:46:26] they would give away the secrets
[1:46:34] heavy then was close
[1:46:38] oh I won't be able to get to my other
[1:46:40] part but I'm gonna set it up for the
[1:46:42] next part
[1:46:44] so heaven was close
[1:46:50] why was Heaven closed
[1:46:53] because all the activity was on Earth
[1:47:00] that's what happened today
[1:47:03] the scene was set
[1:47:05] and now there was a people
[1:47:08] that came on the scene
[1:47:11] the actors of the seventh seals
[1:47:14] you could Now call Jesus on the scene
[1:47:19] how did they know how to call Jesus on
[1:47:22] the scene
[1:47:24] because a prophet had already come to
[1:47:26] show us
[1:47:27] [Applause]
[1:47:37] why am I
[1:47:39] here we go just a few more okay and then
[1:47:41] I'll let you go
[1:47:43] then something came in an unknown time
[1:47:49] what was the
[1:47:51] question
[1:47:56] when seven Thunders uttered
[1:48:08] and he saw like letters right
[1:48:12] is that it was spelling out something
[1:48:16] he said but I couldn't see what it was
[1:48:18] spelling out
[1:48:21] watch this now so something happened
[1:48:23] yesterday it doesn't happen today
[1:48:26] something came in
[1:48:29] the same way in the time of Daniel
[1:48:33] that the dispensation of the Gentiles
[1:48:37] it started with unknown tongues
[1:48:41] the dispensation of the Gentiles
[1:48:45] also finishes with unknown terms
[1:48:49] oh my what part then
[1:48:56] how does your economy look right now
[1:48:58] economia
[1:49:00] you happy under
[1:49:02] first

[1:49:22] the economy of God
[1:49:36] is finished

[1:52:01] bit of time and
[1:52:03] digest everything that's gone on but
[1:52:06] until then we're going to keep on going
[1:52:09] so the first thing young people
[1:52:12] was squirrels brought into it yeah

[1:54:25] now when we look at this
[1:54:28] you have to know
[1:54:30] in this case of air which pole that
[1:54:32] you're living in
[1:54:34] we're finishing for today yeah I'm just
[1:54:37] going to finish with these last few
[1:54:38] Saints
[1:54:39] you've got to know what pool you're
[1:54:42] living under
[1:54:44] in order to know if you have the right
[1:54:46] economy but as you meet the challenges
[1:54:52] if you're coming to church and just want
[1:54:55] to see Miracle after Miracles
[1:54:58] you're staying in the first pool
[1:55:01] looking for a miracle for this
[1:55:04] God would rather heal you than do a
[1:55:06] miracle
[1:55:08] because healing test your faith
[1:55:13] [Music]
[1:55:14] if you want the Lord to cleanse your
[1:55:16] heart
[1:55:17] from all unrighteousness Bueno
[1:55:22] in the second pool
[1:55:24] he has searched the hearts
[1:55:28] but if you want to be reserved
[1:55:32] you've got to resurrect spiritually
[1:55:34] before there is a physical resolution
[1:55:39] and if you want a resurrection in your
[1:55:43] life
[1:55:49] this is the economy of God and where it
[1:55:52] is today
[1:55:54] your economic status
[1:56:06] by what is pulling you foreign
[1:56:29] at the two
[1:57:13] that's what determines it is
[1:57:15] does your economy permit you to create
[1:57:21] oh come on I'm finishing now
[1:57:25] and you create
[1:57:32] there's the people
[1:57:33] brother Jesus said Greater Works than
[1:57:36] this shall you do okay
[1:57:41] do the first words
[1:57:44] and then when you can do that then you
[1:57:46] can go to Greater World
[1:57:50] jumping right to the Greater Works
[1:57:56] come up higher this morning
[1:57:59] I want to end with this
[1:58:01] the economy of God I pray that it has
[1:58:05] been a blessing to you
[1:58:08] but I just want to just add this part
[1:58:10] brother William Feud come is
[1:58:18] the complete revealing of the word
[1:58:23] but not just the revealing
[1:58:28] remember what what I said in in El Paso
[1:58:31] those of you that heard the message
[1:58:33] when the word is being revealed
[1:58:37] says now now watch for this
[1:58:41] the word is being revealed
[1:58:44] that means that something's coming
[1:58:50] the message has been revealed
[1:58:53] the Mysteries have been opened
[1:58:56] what was coming
[1:59:00] perfect
[1:59:01] I want to be part of that economy or in
[1:59:05] the days of the voice of the Seven
[1:59:07] Things
[1:59:12] the mystery of God should be finished
[1:59:19] as he has declared to his servants the
[1:59:21] prophets
[1:59:23] in the days of the voice of the seventh
[1:59:26] Angels
[1:59:27] the great economy of God
[1:59:36] I don't know about you but we're going
[1:59:38] home
[1:59:40] and there is a kingdom yes that'll wipe
[1:59:44] out all these worldly kingdoms
[1:59:48] Jesus Christ
[1:59:50] will reign in that Kingdom
[1:59:53] we are his bride we will reign with him
[2:00:03] that cannot and will not fail
[2:00:07] that's what he came to bring
[2:00:10] now he says this is
[2:00:14] the time that is
[2:00:17] the time was not at hand previously
[2:00:22] as we as we finish
[2:00:25] you've been sitting for a little bit
[2:00:27] for your time
[2:00:29] in the wisdom
[2:00:32] and the economy of God
[2:00:35] this Mighty Revelation is
[2:00:39] though fully known to God
[2:00:42] it could not come forth
[2:00:47] thus we immediately learn the principles
[2:00:52] the revelation of God
[2:00:56] for each age
[2:00:58] can only come in that age only
[2:01:03] specific time
[2:01:05] look at the history of Israel
[2:01:08] Israel the revelation of God to Moses
[2:01:16] and even more specific
[2:01:20] came as the people Cried unto God
[2:01:25] and Jesus himself
[2:01:28] he came at the fullness of time
[2:01:31] he being the complete revelation of the
[2:01:35] godhead
[2:01:37] and in this age
[2:01:42] the revelation of God
[2:01:44] will come in its due time
[2:01:48] it will not alter
[2:01:51] neither will it be premature
[2:01:55] think on this
[2:01:57] he did well he
[2:02:03] El fin
[2:02:05] oi
[2:02:06] so I asked we have set a foundation
[2:02:10] fundamental for this message in this
[2:02:12] subjects
[2:02:20] I see people in lives
[2:02:23] and the Lord shows things
[2:02:27] my heart hurts
[2:02:33] because I see homes that are
[2:02:36] not balance balance
[2:02:42] I see relationships that are
[2:02:45] at balance
[2:02:50] they have a wrong economy
[2:02:54] they've left out the most important
[2:02:56] things
[2:03:00] so now just where you're at I either
[2:03:02] understand
[2:03:04] you say brother I'm just a little time
[2:03:12] of being in Balance
[2:03:15] I'm a little tired brother of
[2:03:23] not having the right economy in my home
[2:03:31] if you say me and my wife brother we
[2:03:33] need help this is
[2:03:37] we're out of balance
[2:03:43] the first thing you got to get yourself
[2:03:45] right
[2:03:48] and then go on to the marriage
[2:03:54] so I challenge
[2:03:55] everyone that's here
[2:03:58] whoever needs
[2:04:00] whoever needs a
[2:04:02] touch from the Lord
[2:04:04] whoever needs to be to be drawn or or
[2:04:08] pulled into the economy
[2:04:14] raise your hand
[2:04:18] if you feel that you have
[2:04:19] gone away from God
[2:04:25] and you feel the pull this morning
[2:04:30] then let us the Holy Spirit goes Goes
