[50:57] precious name of our lord and savior
[50:59] jesus christ
[51:04] i greet you neighbor
[51:06] good
[51:11] amen neighbor
[51:19] amen
[51:26] and this would be
[51:27] subtitled the law
[51:29] of attraction
[51:32] now it seems kind of uh with all that's
[51:34] going on in the world
[51:50] and
[51:51] the greatest thing that could happen is
[51:53] that we would be prepared for the coming
[51:55] of the lord
[51:59] let's get into the word matthew the 17th
[52:01] chapter verse five
[52:13] and it reads like this while he yet
[52:15] spake behold a bright cloud overshadowed
[52:17] them and you hold a voice
[52:19] out of the cloud which said
[52:21] this is my beloved son in whom i am
[52:24] well pleased
[52:26] hear ye
[52:27] is
[52:43] you must be in the same frequency
[52:48] must be in the same vibration
[52:52] you'll understand that in a moment
[52:54] one more scripture first corinthians 14.
[52:57] what is in verse 10.
[53:12] you can say man
[53:16] and it reads there are
[53:19] it may be
[53:22] so many kinds of voices
[53:24] in the world
[53:26] and none of them
[53:27] is without signification
[53:37] once again
[53:39] so many kinds of voices
[53:48] amen may god add his blessings to the
[53:50] reading of his word you may be seated
[53:54] no
[53:55] truer words were ever spoken
[54:00] that is what our founding pastor would
[54:02] always say
[54:04] all truer words were ever spoken
[54:08] there are so many kinds of voices
[54:11] in the world
[54:13] and there's more today than there ever
[54:16] has been in the history of the world
[54:20] we talk about knowledge increasing
[54:35] then there's the
[54:36] ugly there's lots of things going on
[54:41] and as the scripture says every voice
[54:44] has some kind of significance
[54:49] a man
[54:50] by the name of dr peterson
[54:53] peterson who was once an atheist
[54:56] now turned christian
[54:59] he made this statement uh when
[55:01] discussing the topic of the bible being
[55:03] true
[55:30] which he says which makes it
[55:41] i want to repeat that because i want you
[55:43] to get this
[55:44] it isn't that the bible is true no
[55:48] is the bible true it's not that it say
[55:51] oh this book is is a true book
[55:55] what he's saying is that the bible is
[55:57] the precondition
[56:00] for the
[56:14] it's something more than just oh that's
[56:16] true
[56:17] somebody takes the statement oh that's
[56:19] true
[56:21] more than just true
[56:23] it is the very basis for every where
[56:25] everything else is
[56:42] jesus
[57:10] but that
[57:22] is the very embodiment of truth
[57:29] amen or amen
[57:30] i'm going to say it again
[57:32] jesus christ
[57:34] it's not just all what he said was true
[57:37] that's the very embodiment
[57:43] [Music]
[57:50] embodiment of christ the word
[58:01] so many as i said so many kinds of
[58:03] voices in the world
[58:33] and that's why everything that we hear
[58:37] must be passed through a filter
[58:40] the filter is god's word
[58:44] we must be very careful what we open our
[58:46] hearts too
[58:48] while
[59:00] has a specific language right
[59:30] speaks different than any other preacher
[59:32] out there
[59:35] because he is tuned in perfectly
[59:40] the same frequency
[59:42] comes forth from the throne
[59:49] the problem isn't that that people hear
[59:51] the message
[59:54] it's that they try to hybrid it with
[59:56] something else
[1:00:27] you go to school that you learn
[1:00:28] different things and and it's good that
[1:00:30] somebody has wisdom in certain subjects
[1:00:36] but our soul is not hanging on their
[1:00:38] words
[1:00:52] i can learn a lot of things from a lot
[1:00:54] of people
[1:01:08] and i give
[1:01:42] sometimes you hear somebody express
[1:01:44] things that maybe you were thinking but
[1:01:46] you didn't know how to express it
[1:01:47] yourself
[1:01:59] really i mean when he when he gets into
[1:02:01] into his teachings
[1:02:04] motivational try to change your way of
[1:02:06] living and so forth
[1:02:09] very interesting very very very smart
[1:02:12] man
[1:02:14] and i was given a video or showing a
[1:02:16] video
[1:02:18] he was uh explaining the law of
[1:02:20] attraction
[1:02:23] i i i heard him for a little bit and i
[1:02:25] and and i heard what he had to say
[1:02:28] and in certain parts i said this man
[1:02:30] listens to brother branham
[1:02:38] but you also see that he's after a
[1:02:40] certain thing to help people in certain
[1:02:42] ways
[1:02:46] and i want to go over some of these
[1:02:48] comments that he made
[1:02:50] i'm not promoting bob proctor this
[1:02:52] morning
[1:02:53] i still understand that but not
[1:02:55] promoting him
[1:02:56] but there are things that really
[1:02:58] activate or get you to think about
[1:03:00] certain things
[1:03:19] there are people here that are very wise
[1:03:21] and
[1:03:22] and smart in these things
[1:03:24] but i think we all know right we're all
[1:03:26] we're all we are all a molecular
[1:03:28] structure
[1:03:47] and it vibrates at a very high speed
[1:03:52] so even the person that's sluggish or
[1:03:55] slow
[1:04:10] you are
[1:04:22] he said if you could look at your body
[1:04:24] under a microscope
[1:04:39] your cells they're they're vibrating
[1:04:41] they're moving all the time
[1:04:44] he said that how you use your mind
[1:04:48] dictates the vibration that you're in
[1:05:05] dictates the vibrations that's going on
[1:05:08] inside of you
[1:05:10] he said our mind is made up of uh of two
[1:05:13] parts
[1:05:15] it is made up of the conscience and the
[1:05:17] subconscious
[1:05:19] and when we see this
[1:05:31] and all that that he sees and he starts
[1:05:34] to learn everything sticks to him
[1:05:38] we all notice that as we get older we
[1:05:40] don't we have to we just nothing seems
[1:05:43] to stick
[1:05:44] to the person
[1:05:46] here
[1:05:48] i heard people say soy como teflon
[1:05:51] teflon
[1:05:52] nothing sticks to it
[1:05:55] is true
[1:05:57] i'm getting a little older i'm like
[1:06:00] telling the truth the whole time
[1:06:04] we see this
[1:06:05] it it it shows that as children we are
[1:06:08] constantly being bombarded
[1:06:13] and there's a saying that says
[1:06:16] that we
[1:06:29] and whatever environment is around
[1:06:31] that's how you learn your habits
[1:06:34] you learn how to do deal things and how
[1:06:36] you handle things
[1:06:38] and on and on we can go
[1:06:41] it says but but then you stop for a
[1:06:44] moment
[1:06:46] because we are not just the product of
[1:06:48] our environment
[1:06:51] we are also the product of a dna strand
[1:06:58] from our
[1:07:05] we are not just the products of the
[1:07:07] environment
[1:07:09] but what we are when we come to this
[1:07:11] world
[1:07:27] we were born the wrong way
[1:07:30] and when we see that
[1:07:32] we realize
[1:07:34] so many characteristics that we have
[1:07:37] characteristics
[1:07:39] would be from our parents or
[1:07:40] grandparents or great-grandparents
[1:07:45] and even if we didn't even know them
[1:07:47] yeah
[1:07:49] all of a sudden you say that's the way
[1:07:51] my grandmother used to act
[1:08:08] we are the product of the dna
[1:08:12] but we are also the product of the
[1:08:14] environment
[1:08:16] shaped in iniquities
[1:08:18] and when we when we realize that
[1:08:21] we realize
[1:08:23] we don't have much hope do we say
[1:08:26] that the human being doesn't have much
[1:08:28] hope
[1:08:31] look at the way that
[1:08:33] that i am
[1:08:35] and when you when you look back and see
[1:08:37] what brother branham has to say
[1:08:40] he begins to tell us
[1:08:43] he says he says
[1:08:45] and the people today
[1:08:47] are teenagers out in high school
[1:08:56] little girls living in adultery
[1:08:59] boys little boys and wow the what kind
[1:09:02] of generation is coming up after
[1:09:33] if that's what makes the little girls
[1:09:35] act like they do
[1:09:38] that their mommy their mammy was a
[1:09:40] flapper
[1:09:42] your grandmother was a chorus girl
[1:09:45] that's the reason she's a striptease
[1:09:48] today
[1:09:51] because he said that he would visit the
[1:09:53] iniquity of the fathers
[1:09:57] upon the children
[1:09:59] and the children's children to the third
[1:10:03] and the fourth generation
[1:10:05] already encoded in your dna
[1:10:10] and when the whole things began to leak
[1:10:13] out
[1:10:16] the righteous seed begins setting on the
[1:10:17] side
[1:10:18] that seed gets thinner and thinner and
[1:10:21] thinner
[1:10:24] and the wicked just keep on getting very
[1:10:26] religious he loves malik don't last
[1:10:29] but they keep getting wickeder and
[1:10:30] wickeder
[1:10:32] there's nothing to do he says but
[1:10:34] destroy the whole thing
[1:10:37] like he did in the antediluvian district
[1:10:42] every
[1:11:20] that's the reason we're in the condition
[1:11:23] we're in today
[1:11:35] [Music]
[1:11:38] to
[1:12:06] i want to stop and make emphasis on this
[1:12:09] you've got to be careful how you pray
[1:12:12] today
[1:12:14] we spoke on last sunday
[1:12:16] jurisdiction
[1:12:18] these demons are also given jurisdiction
[1:12:32] but when prophecy comes from for
[1:12:34] judgment
[1:13:03] they'll come after you and then because
[1:13:04] you're praying the wrong prayers
[1:13:08] to remove something that is part of the
[1:13:09] prophecy yes
[1:13:12] yeah everybody understand me in that
[1:13:14] sentence now we do pray that god that
[1:13:16] there is a protection upon god's people
[1:13:22] but as we see this unfold i i want to
[1:13:24] get this get something across so so good
[1:13:27] this morning
[1:13:30] he says that
[1:13:33] when we look at our minds
[1:13:36] he says it's it's we have to understand
[1:13:39] the law
[1:13:40] of attraction
[1:13:44] and
[1:13:44] and in understanding this
[1:13:48] we we we see that that he says
[1:13:51] what is uh it comes to the word paradigm
[1:13:54] is the word he was using
[1:13:56] paradigm you've heard the word paradigm
[1:13:58] right
[1:14:12] a paradigm is is a multitude of habits
[1:14:18] it is not in your mind he says it's in
[1:14:20] your subconscious mind not in your
[1:14:22] conscience in your subconscious mind
[1:14:26] he defines it as a multitude of habits
[1:14:29] it's a collection of all your beliefs
[1:14:34] they're held closely
[1:14:37] by a group of people
[1:14:39] and it's not
[1:14:53] now when we when we see this and he's
[1:14:55] what he's saying is is that in the
[1:14:57] subconscious
[1:15:00] that paradigm is what's controlling you
[1:15:03] whatever the habits and the beliefs and
[1:15:05] all that you have that you hold dear
[1:15:21] that in our subconscious
[1:15:35] all your thoughts that come forth
[1:15:39] so far
[1:15:41] it depends on the nature of the soul
[1:15:43] depending on
[1:15:44] whatever the nature is
[1:15:46] soul controls your spirit
[1:15:50] that spirit controls your body control
[1:15:53] abc's yes
[1:15:54] like they said brother caleb you can't
[1:15:56] drink because you're a pastor
[1:15:59] i would say i can do just as easy as you
[1:16:02] well
[1:16:04] and then
[1:16:08] is that on the inside
[1:16:11] there is nothing that is asking for this
[1:16:14] that's why many times when we struggle
[1:16:16] with things in our lives
[1:16:27] he says if the paradigm isn't shifted or
[1:16:30] changed
[1:16:46] the moment
[1:16:57] that's why the change doesn't start from
[1:16:59] the outside
[1:17:12] that begins to change
[1:17:52] jesus never said
[1:17:54] well so what i did peter i asked him to
[1:17:56] leave you alone
[1:18:00] there's no growth in that
[1:18:02] recipient no overcoming in that by not
[1:18:04] giving you sometimes we want to do that
[1:18:06] all the time
[1:18:08] whether it's with our children or
[1:18:09] whoever else
[1:18:23] i pray that your faith wouldn't fail you
[1:18:26] yeah
[1:18:27] that's what we're praying today
[1:18:30] no matter what each one of you is going
[1:18:32] through
[1:18:33] we pray that your faith will not fail
[1:18:51] your children will be judged for what
[1:18:53] you do
[1:18:56] haven't you no respect or decency he
[1:18:59] says
[1:19:01] girls wearing your little shorts and
[1:19:02] things around
[1:19:05] and you know that's reflected
[1:19:34] that will
[1:19:39] [Music]
[1:19:56] he said that your paradigm is where is
[1:19:58] where your energy flows
[1:20:01] you get different religions and they go
[1:20:03] into all the energies and they want to
[1:20:05] and that's that's their thing
[1:20:09] i'm not just talking about blowing
[1:20:10] energy
[1:20:12] i'm talking about life
[1:20:16] those cannot produce life
[1:20:20] they can produce church members
[1:20:23] they can produce followers
[1:20:26] but they cannot produce life there are
[1:20:27] no points that's what we're after here
[1:20:41] this man says
[1:20:42] this energy then flows
[1:21:12] who is
[1:21:27] now watch this now think it so now
[1:21:29] as he explains it
[1:21:32] the type of thoughts you get
[1:21:36] depends on the energy that's coming
[1:21:37] forth from you depend depending on your
[1:21:39] question
[1:21:51] you are living in a certain state of
[1:21:54] vibration
[1:22:03] oh my goodness
[1:22:04] now if you have a certain type of energy
[1:22:06] flowing through you see this is
[1:22:20] because you're trying to get a different
[1:22:21] vibration or frequency
[1:22:25] start to do something different than
[1:22:27] what you've done for years
[1:22:31] your paradigm kicks it out and says
[1:22:35] that makes me uncomfortable
[1:22:55] but watch this now
[1:22:57] the paradigm kicks it out
[1:23:01] it's the same thing then when we look at
[1:23:03] it
[1:23:19] attracts
[1:23:21] other frequencies of light manner
[1:23:27] this morning
[1:23:28] come on now we we want to this this is
[1:23:30] all just a
[1:23:31] a
[1:23:32] a foundation for where we're going
[1:23:35] fundamentally
[1:23:36] whatever vibration we're in
[1:23:39] will only attract the same vibration
[1:23:46] still do but but when we were young
[1:23:48] i thought we had to have no tv
[1:23:51] all we had was a radio
[1:23:54] radio and the
[1:23:55] cowboys were playing it
[1:24:00] so here we go
[1:24:02] trying to find the right frequency right
[1:24:05] right
[1:24:10] and then sometimes we pick up
[1:24:12] those cowboys
[1:24:29] then we turn it a little bit more
[1:24:32] then then you hear
[1:24:33] okay we have a fourth quarter
[1:24:37] and you're like next thing you know your
[1:24:39] anybody ever get foil
[1:24:41] and put stuff
[1:24:57] it's the way we are many times today is
[1:24:59] it almost sometimes we just can't get
[1:25:02] the right i mean we hear the message
[1:25:05] but there's so much static around
[1:25:07] i don't know
[1:25:08] we're not in church and our mind is
[1:25:10] going somewhere else
[1:25:51] our vibration is right
[1:25:54] we're in the right channel
[1:25:57] comes forward
[1:26:01] and what is it doing there's a
[1:26:03] connection there you're not going to
[1:26:04] expect it becomes the law of attraction
[1:27:30] shift away from each other
[1:27:33] we are not in the same in the same
[1:27:35] channel anymore
[1:27:37] we're not in the same vibration
[1:27:41] you don't like what's going on
[1:27:53] [Music]
[1:27:56] are you with me come on now i want to
[1:27:58] know
[1:28:39] you know that brother
[1:28:53] sit there and listen to garbage
[1:28:59] why
[1:29:00] my paradigm or
[1:29:02] my nature
[1:29:04] oh i don't want that i don't need that
[1:29:19] you attract people that are in harmony
[1:29:21] with you yeah
[1:29:36] and
[1:29:45] he gives an example which i i i
[1:29:47] i looked at then i said wow that's
[1:29:48] that's the way another way to look at it
[1:30:04] they lack or they they attract
[1:30:08] attract lack
[1:30:10] and limitations
[1:30:16] and limitations oh i can't do that
[1:30:46] talk the
[1:30:59] [Music]
[1:31:01] something's not right
[1:31:04] when i see this
[1:31:06] oh i see that that
[1:31:08] as a christian
[1:31:10] cristiano there is something in me that
[1:31:12] controls me then i always
[1:31:14] control it is what we
[1:31:16] what we look at and we say
[1:31:18] we all need a new birth
[1:31:23] you ain't going to get away from it
[1:31:25] shift away from your vibration unless
[1:31:27] you're born again
[1:31:56] want i want you to follow me in here
[1:31:58] okay
[1:31:59] now now notice this now think you say
[1:32:01] the law of vibration
[1:32:04] and the law of attraction he says
[1:32:07] are intimately connected
[1:32:10] the law of vibration is the primary law
[1:32:15] and the law of attraction is the
[1:32:17] secondary law
[1:32:19] because vibration is what causes the
[1:32:22] attraction
[1:32:34] we see this and we say my goodness
[1:32:36] we don't have to think about a lot of
[1:32:38] things
[1:32:40] if you feel grateful
[1:32:43] you raise your vibration
[1:32:49] more things to be grateful
[1:32:52] if you feel
[1:33:06] and
[1:33:20] once
[1:33:26] watch what he says here and this is
[1:33:28] where we began to differ from this smart
[1:33:31] man this wise man
[1:33:46] i want you to get this because this is
[1:33:47] our because we're getting into our
[1:33:49] message now
[1:33:50] now you have a man
[1:33:52] that lives in this other world
[1:33:55] and no better person to tell you what it
[1:33:57] is
[1:34:00] one that has been there mascara
[1:34:14] and i love this
[1:34:15] and then he goes on to say he says
[1:34:18] the subconscious
[1:34:21] in the subconscious is a soul
[1:34:25] watch here
[1:34:26] it's not the mind that controls your
[1:34:28] nerves
[1:34:30] controls
[1:34:32] oh think different and then you won't be
[1:34:34] as nervous
[1:34:37] it's not your mind that controls your
[1:34:39] nerves
[1:34:41] the soul that's controlling your nerves
[1:34:59] and if there's doubt
[1:35:01] it's sending a vibration
[1:35:04] and that vibration is a vibration of
[1:35:05] unbelief
[1:35:07] and it's telling you no no no it's not
[1:35:09] possible there's no no no no no that's
[1:35:11] not for me no experience what's
[1:35:27] because that is the frequency you're
[1:35:29] living under but
[1:35:31] i said it's your soul that controls the
[1:35:33] nerves
[1:35:35] and then he says put on a lie detector
[1:35:40] and it doesn't matter how much you get
[1:35:42] your mind thinking
[1:35:46] come on
[1:35:47] and i'm going to think it this way and
[1:35:48] i'm going to i'm going to try to be
[1:35:50] deceptive
[1:35:52] and then you have this eye detector on
[1:35:53] you and it is
[1:36:36] how upset you get or whatever
[1:36:39] your soul will not lie
[1:36:42] it'll tell you exactly what's going on
[1:36:46] you see
[1:36:47] there is a vibration that unbelief sends
[1:36:50] through
[1:37:04] look to what
[1:37:18] leaving it why you change the the state
[1:37:21] at which you're living right
[1:37:24] change the vibration
[1:37:28] how many want to leave this building
[1:37:29] happy and free
[1:38:00] and it's telling
[1:38:12] now my question is can you believe your
[1:38:14] own words
[1:38:56] anybody ready for that this morning
[1:38:59] such a vibration would go to the podium
[1:39:02] already
[1:39:04] it was all done at calvary
[1:39:07] but let's take it and bring it to our
[1:39:08] day and say it's for me now
[1:39:38] it
[1:39:41] my wife was telling me that the other
[1:39:43] day
[1:39:45] she was
[1:39:47] she was uh
[1:39:50] at a store with with i forget who
[1:39:52] who
[1:39:55] [Music]
[1:40:05] how did you know
[1:40:49] that is sent forth by faith
[1:40:52] watch this he says you're a christian
[1:40:55] it's the vibration of your spirit
[1:41:15] is
[1:41:19] [Music]
[1:41:28] what would happen
[1:41:29] que pasawa
[1:41:42] and we know that because he would say it
[1:41:44] over and over again
[1:41:47] one of the times that he's praying for
[1:41:48] somebody
[1:41:50] with your hand
[1:41:51] and he says oh brother i know you've
[1:41:53] been wanting to see if this really works
[1:41:58] you know and then brother what was the
[1:42:00] name of that watch brother brother henry
[1:42:02] that you're dead
[1:42:04] long that's right and so he would say
[1:42:07] you know these longini watches
[1:42:10] when that when that vibration comes
[1:42:12] through my hand
[1:42:54] that was the vibration
[1:43:03] man
[1:43:05] you with me this morning
[1:43:07] i feel you pulling good so keep on
[1:43:09] pulling
[1:43:11] watch
[1:43:12] what he says here now
[1:43:14] goes on and he says
[1:43:16] you see the swelling and so forth
[1:43:32] [Music]
[1:43:37] and there was a vibration pouring from
[1:43:40] that ruptured appendix
[1:43:46] all right he says now if there's a germ
[1:43:48] problem there
[1:44:04] so then he would he would say okay this
[1:44:06] is what's going on inside your body
[1:44:10] and he would pray for them
[1:44:12] so many times it would stop instantly
[1:44:17] that vibration
[1:44:22] [Music]
[1:44:29] begins to pick up different things
[1:44:35] when the life of christ began to move in
[1:44:37] our bodies
[1:44:40] things began to happen
[1:44:44] how you say brother that's the spiritual
[1:44:45] realm
[1:44:55] in the physical realm in their own
[1:44:56] physical now notice this because this is
[1:44:59] so important to get is
[1:45:12] with eternal life
[1:45:23] why do
[1:45:24] you do people like to hear certain kinds
[1:45:27] of music

[1:46:26] dancing to that is that content
[1:46:28] was born
[1:46:33] that's the vibration
[1:46:36] and we're happy about that vibration
[1:46:47] it doesn't matter how much you say
[1:46:48] you're a christian
[1:46:50] vibration is what is calling or
[1:46:52] attracting it
[1:47:17] but watch as we get into that right
[1:47:20] vibration the right frequency and that's
[1:47:23] not for the question
[1:47:25] oh great holy spirit of god oh god as
[1:47:28] life begins
[1:47:31] this mortal life began to gray
[1:47:34] the hairs
[1:47:46] within our mortal beings
[1:48:16] mortality
[1:48:24] [Music]
[1:48:30] most
[1:48:31] [Music]
[1:48:49] i'm going to say it again we're always
[1:48:50] looking for the answers
[1:48:53] that we can be happy
[1:48:55] and have a wonderful life
[1:48:58] and then
[1:49:07] we're always looking outside oh my
[1:49:09] goodness what can i where can i find an
[1:49:11] answer to this
[1:49:26] you find that most people don't like to
[1:49:28] be by themselves
[1:49:32] no babe come on come with me
[1:49:35] oh stay with me baby no okay
[1:49:37] maybe even even adults sometimes they
[1:49:39] don't want they're afraid of the dark
[1:50:32] that will help you get rich and help you
[1:50:34] do a lot of things
[1:50:36] they have keystone
[1:51:18] instead
[1:51:31] one of these days
[1:51:48] [Music]
[1:52:12] but unless we start studying ourselves
[1:52:28] but because we lack understanding of who
[1:52:31] we are
[1:52:34] we are locked into a physical world
[1:52:38] that's why everything outside of us
[1:52:40] controls
[1:52:55] the unseen or the spiritual
[1:53:24] 95 of the people never learn how to live
[1:53:28] their life
[1:53:32] they are not living at all
[1:53:35] they react to everything around them
[1:53:49] come on
[1:53:57] [Music]
[1:54:41] well i was baptized with the holy ghost
[1:54:43] years ago
[1:54:47] baptized put faith from california
[1:54:50] baptism of faith
[1:54:52] baptism of virtue
[1:54:54] of knowledge
[1:54:56] of patience
[1:55:14] it only quickens the eternal seed gene
[1:55:32] holy hacker
[1:55:34] you know mackerel never mind
[1:55:37] i was going to tell you about the macro
[1:55:39] that's not even important
[1:55:41] first corinthians 14 10.
[1:55:44] one more time
[1:55:46] there are it may be so many kinds of
[1:55:48] voices in the world
[1:55:51] and none of them
[1:55:52] without significance
[1:55:57] everyone has a meaning
[1:56:01] and when you enter into this place the
[1:56:02] message hear his voice
[1:56:04] when you enter into the place where the
[1:56:06] doubts have passed away
[1:56:10] then you're free
[1:56:12] and you can hear the voice of god
[1:56:13] speaking
[1:56:14] a child of mine i am your savior
[1:56:18] the mind i am your healer
[1:56:20] you don't have to do these things
[1:56:24] that you might be free
[1:56:27] but as long as you're down here in this
[1:56:29] vibration
[1:56:33] you're down here in this vibration
[1:56:37] mixed up with all kinds of voices
[1:56:54] is
[1:56:57] when we see this
[1:57:00] when we we see this
[1:57:02] though
[1:57:03] we hear voices singing
[1:57:08] we hear voices everywhere we go
[1:57:11] all kinds of vibrations
[1:57:14] each voice is a vibration
[1:57:16] every sound is a vibration
[1:57:19] and in order for a sound to be heard
[1:57:21] listen closely
[1:57:35] number three you have to have a medium
[1:57:38] something for the sound to travel
[1:57:39] through i don't know
[1:57:42] liquids gasses
[1:57:44] did you know that sound cannot travel
[1:57:47] through a vacuum
[1:57:48] [Music]
[1:58:01] no wonder the soul
[1:58:04] where is it at in the heart
[1:58:06] and in that compartment i understand
[1:58:08] there's nothing
[1:58:09] right
[1:58:11] there's nothing to vibrate
[1:58:16] oh it says and you need a receiver it is
[1:58:32] we're sitting there at the table and
[1:58:34] subject
[1:58:37] if a tree falls in the forest
[1:58:41] there's nobody there to hear it
[1:58:46] has
[1:58:51] it's something you
[1:58:53] right away you're going to get on one
[1:58:54] side or the other hand
[1:58:58] no it doesn't make a sound
[1:59:00] no no doesn't matter if somebody's there
[1:59:02] not of course it makes noise it makes a
[1:59:03] sound no yes
[1:59:06] no
[1:59:07] something to think about
[1:59:09] this is important for the message
[1:59:11] because we have our ideas of turn things
[1:59:28] i gave
[1:59:42] we resumed it later especially
[1:59:46] i ain't about to let it go you know
[1:59:49] cinemas
[1:59:54] i said now i'm not taking this i'm just
[1:59:56] i want you to see something else
[1:59:59] after her that it
[2:00:01] doesn't make a sound
[2:00:02] [Music]
[2:00:04] to understand that that watch you're
[2:00:05] looking at it from here but look at it
[2:00:06] from this point
[2:00:09] after you break it down
[2:00:15] okay there has to be a source
[2:00:18] a medium
[2:00:19] and a receiver
[2:00:21] now watch it it goes down kind of three
[2:00:24] and it hits
[2:00:50] there has to be an apparatus
[2:01:06] there's a nerve that's dead are you
[2:01:08] nervous
[2:01:14] and i said now watch the lord jesus
[2:01:17] hear the lord
[2:01:32] that will pick up the literal body of
[2:01:34] the lord or the literal voice of the
[2:01:36] lord jesus christ
[2:01:47] there's an apparatus picking up those
[2:01:48] waves that continue to go around
[2:01:53] the same thing with us
[2:01:55] when we speak a word
[2:01:59] or a good word
[2:02:01] sound waves go around
[2:02:31] against
[2:02:38] now
[2:02:39] now notice this now
[2:02:41] it's what i wanted her to understand
[2:02:44] it's
[2:02:59] five ten minutes max and then i'll let
[2:03:00] you go i promise
[2:03:03] yes see
[2:03:05] majority
[2:03:06] majority rule so i gotta stop
[2:03:10] here
[2:03:25] [Music]
[2:03:40] they're
[2:04:06] he says now here's
[2:04:08] on the baptismal
[2:04:22] the prophet the prophecy
[2:04:24] or the prophet the prophet the
[2:04:26] attraction goes from the prophet to the
[2:04:27] prophecy
[2:04:30] what is the prophecy
[2:04:32] now it's going to be fulfilled
[2:04:34] because the voice was spoken
[2:04:50] now watch their vibration changes
[2:04:53] now they begin to recognize who they are
[2:04:56] there's a lot of prophecies that were
[2:04:58] spoken about the bride of christ
[2:05:01] how many is he talking about
[2:05:03] that vibration has to change your
[2:05:05] vibration
[2:05:09] the real
[2:05:10] law of attraction
[2:05:13] where the prophet speaks it's the voice
[2:05:14] of god
[2:05:18] the vibrations that go forth around the
[2:05:20] world
[2:05:24] but it will not rain
[2:05:29] come on now
[2:05:30] a man can't speak that just to speak it
[2:05:32] uh
[2:06:00] of
[2:06:03] [Music]
[2:06:56] here we are but let me explain this for
[2:06:58] a moment
[2:06:59] i hear the sound of the abundance of
[2:07:01] rain
[2:07:03] by hearing
[2:07:05] by the word of god
[2:07:07] and when that state drops to the heart
[2:07:10] now
[2:07:24] when it
[2:08:06] did you know
[2:08:27] our
[2:08:28] frequencies are created
[2:08:30] in us at that this very moment
[2:08:34] using
[2:09:03] here on earth
[2:09:06] we love you pastor pastor believe you
[2:09:11] watch it we just say your thoughts are
[2:09:13] louder
[2:09:16] than it is
[2:09:29] god bless you brother
[2:09:43] it's all about the vibrations
[2:10:12] the mind of the
[2:10:22] and both of those
[2:10:24] could be imitated
[2:10:40] but for the bride
[2:10:44] because it dealt with our soul
[2:10:48] notice this now it is now changing the
[2:10:50] whole atmosphere
[2:10:52] the vibration
[2:10:54] pull that
[2:11:08] you've
[2:11:20] and i'm going to say this as the as the
[2:11:22] musicians come
[2:11:34] hello everybody
[2:11:35] i want to say it again
[2:11:37] we've come to a place
[2:11:39] oh you can have a lot of discussions
[2:11:41] about the third pool
[2:11:44] something but it's time to stop waiting
[2:11:46] for things
[2:11:50] here
[2:12:11] it's time to stop looking at prophecy
[2:12:14] it's time to stop looking at prophecy
[2:12:18] and start looking at the fulfillment
[2:12:22] that's where we are at church
[2:12:25] start looking at it
[2:12:27] not for it anymore
[2:12:30] i'm gonna ask you i'm gonna challenge
[2:12:31] you this morning
[2:12:45] but the message came for them produced
[2:12:47] the bride
[2:12:50] however much they want to fight against
[2:12:52] it
[2:12:54] we are looking at it already
[2:12:58] well they're arguing about looking for
[2:13:00] something we are looking at something
[2:13:06] we have come into a frequency
[2:13:08] frequency and as we are getting
[2:13:10] ourselves in that frequency
[2:13:14] it
[2:13:24] i just want to let that one sink in for
[2:13:25] a
[2:13:28] moment those that have gone on
[2:13:31] pasado what are they waiting for
[2:13:33] questions
[2:13:39] when the seven still was open
[2:14:10] can you imagine this morning

[2:14:24] to go back home
[2:14:26] come on it's time to go see our loved
[2:14:28] ones
[2:14:30] imagine at that moment
[2:14:33] the voice vibrates
[2:14:35] and all the elements
[2:14:38] made
[2:14:51] that will bring on the resurrection
[2:15:07] play something brother wheel
[2:15:08] i'm going to ask each one now now i'm
[2:15:10] going to challenge your face
[2:15:12] as you close your eyes

[2:15:20] of a gentile
[2:15:22] the perfect faith
[2:15:24] perfect
[2:15:25] is to speak the word
[2:15:28] and then we say
[2:15:29] yes we'll still lay hands on people
[2:15:35] but everybody's waiting for somebody to
[2:15:37] say something
[2:15:40] when that great faith of that centurion
[2:15:46] [Music]
[2:15:59] jesus said i have not seen so great of
[2:16:01] faith
[2:16:16] so i'm gonna ask
[2:16:19] if there's somebody here
[2:16:22] and you're able to believe your own word
[2:16:27] the vibration is here
[2:16:31] if you can connect to that right channel
[2:16:34] i don't care what you're struggling with
[2:16:38] but if you want
[2:16:40] in this moment
[2:16:42] total liberation
