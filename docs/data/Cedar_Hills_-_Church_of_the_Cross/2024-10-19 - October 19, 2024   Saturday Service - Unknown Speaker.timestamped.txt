[17:27] tonight just back there listening
[17:30] to an associate brother of ours in the
[17:33] Lord had just come from Indiana stirred
[17:36] by a strange
[17:38] dream he's never been in streetport
[17:41] before in his life but he dreamed the
[17:43] other night that he come to spport not
[17:47] by his car he come with uh or come
[17:51] somewhere to a church where I was
[17:52] speaking he said after I preached and
[17:55] prayed for the people said something's
[17:58] going to happen
[17:59] said he was back the next day and he
[18:02] said he knew the building how it looks
[18:04] said there's a there's a Civic
[18:06] Auditorium across the
[18:07] street but they never went in the
[18:09] auditorium says on this side in a stone
[18:11] building it had a wing to it and the
[18:14] building sat just like
[18:15] this and the the boy is a dreamer I've
[18:20] seen his dreams and know that they're
[18:22] true and he said um and he said then on
[18:27] the last night
[18:29] that I was speaking and praying for the
[18:31] sick and I said something's fixing to
[18:33] happen and said like a clap of thunder
[18:35] and said people get
[18:37] screaming and said as the Thunder began
[18:39] to go away I said it made a voice and
[18:42] begin speaking say as that speaking was
[18:45] going on that through these lates
[18:47] windows up here come the glory of God
[18:49] moving in in the form of the pillar of
[18:52] fire he's never seen it he's heard us
[18:54] talk about it but he's never seen
[18:56] himself and said there it was come
[18:57] through the windows like that and form
[19:00] that light like you see in the picture
[19:01] right above the audience here and said
[19:04] was rumbling off something and said I
[19:06] stood and said that is Jehovah God and
[19:09] said he was reminded of when thinking
[19:12] about it when Moses called the brought
[19:15] the people out of Egypt and they said
[19:18] let Moses speak and not God lest we die
[19:20] said everybody was laying on the floor
[19:23] their hands up screaming said he was
[19:25] screaming too Lord God I love you I love
[19:27] you and his wife shook him and woke him
[19:29] up see him going down the aisle right
[19:32] now brother Jackson a former Methodist
[19:34] preacher and um he was so Disturbed till
[19:37] he come down and said when he walked in
[19:39] he was so astounded just exactly the way
[19:41] he had saw it in a dream prise I don't
[19:44] know what it means the Lord's kept it
[19:46] from me but something could
[19:49] happen seeing brother Jackson dream that
[19:51] knowing me as an honest real real man
[19:55] servant of God and I I know I've been
[19:58] dreaming dreams coming to me the lord
[20:00] gave me an interpretation it' be just
[20:02] perfectly like that even the one time I
[20:04] going to Arizona he had the dream of it
[20:07] and he's very much Disturbed he's with
[20:09] his wife he brought her she used to be
[20:11] mother right away and the only way he
[20:13] could go would buy airplane he didn't
[20:16] have a penny to come and somebody give
[20:17] him the money and so it's kindy worked
[20:19] out mysteriously so something could
[20:21] happen we hope so we don't know just
[20:24] what the Lord will provide for us now
[20:29] we are grateful to the Lord to be living
[20:32] in the day that we're living in just
[20:36] before the coming of Jesus as I've said
[20:39] before it's the greatest time of all
[20:41] history I'd rather be living right now

[24:23] things brother L just knew in the way
[24:26] the Holy Spirit just told him his
[24:28] married and what he had done and the
[24:29] evils he had done the things he had done
[24:31] when he thought brother Banks is telling
[24:33] me them things but when it really
[24:34] brought him right out and told him what
[24:35] he done the night before that was that
[24:37] was too much for him he couldn't get it
[24:41] then the next morning while we fished
[24:43] all night with little fish was was
[24:45] catching some for bait but he just stole
[24:47] that little fish in the water quivered
[24:50] flowed or about a half hour later we
[24:52] were sitting there I was I said brother
[24:54] L you let the fish swallow the hook all
[24:56] the way down in his stomach see I said
[24:59] take the fly line here flip it over the
[25:01] bait out like that as soon as he touched
[25:03] it I said then just hold him and then
[25:05] bring him in I said he don't pull him
[25:07] out like that don't swall it you catch
[25:09] the fish he said well he had a great big
[25:11] old line hang or says this the way we do
[25:13] it like that so just about that time I
[25:17] heard something coming off top of the
[25:18] mountain up there a horor wind whirling
[25:21] around and around here it come down like
[25:24] that the spirit of God come over the
[25:26] boat so stand up on your feet
[25:30] said speak to that dead fish said I'll
[25:33] give you back your
[25:34] life that little fish been Ling there
[25:36] for a half hour with his inals in his
[25:38] mouth and his guills I said little fishy
[25:41] Jesus Christ gives you back your life
[25:44] live in the name of Jesus Christ flipped
[25:46] over on his back and down through the
[25:47] water he went as hard as he could go
[25:50] brother L are you here somewhere I I
[25:51] seen you last night where there inside
[25:54] outside or where is that raise your hand
[25:55] if I can see what say
[25:58] oh yes way up in the balcony Through the
[26:00] Windows back there that's the man a
[26:03] Jehovah Witness he said brother Bram he
[26:06] all excited he said uh it's h it's good
[26:09] to be here isn't he said uh do you think
[26:12] that meant me that that that that I call
[26:14] that little fish said you shot your last
[26:15] wi said that that that meant something
[26:17] for me I said no no just a
[26:21] confirmation all upset about it well we
[26:26] travel along and you see those things
[26:28] happening knowing I just think what was
[26:31] it to show I had a many little
[26:35] child on my prayer list praying for it
[26:38] but when the vision come it was for a
[26:40] little old fish about so long about two
[26:44] inches long three look like the hook as
[26:47] big as a fish but what it was was to
[26:51] show you that God looks on the little
[26:54] things
[26:55] too one day when lepers land all over
[26:58] the country he used his power and put a
[27:00] curse on a tree and begin to wither when
[27:04] there was people laying everywhere
[27:06] needing that healing power but you see
[27:09] he wanted to show he's God over
[27:11] everything whether it's small whether
[27:14] it's big whatever it is he's still God
[27:17] over all things all the
[27:20] creation so we love him because that
[27:23] that gives us to know if he's
[27:25] interested to speak the word of life
[27:28] life into a little insignificant fish
[27:31] laying there dead on the water for a
[27:32] half hour he can certainly someday Speak
[27:36] Life to his
[27:38] children no matter if your body being
[27:41] more than a spoonful of dust he'll speak
[27:44] and we'll answer him someday he's God
[27:47] who's interested in everything all that
[27:50] we do all that we say everything he
[27:55] interested let us bow our heads
[27:57] everywhere
[28:03] I wonder now before we pray if there's
[28:05] anybody
[28:07] tonight that's interested in him but yet
[28:11] you haven't got your reservations yet
[28:14] for the other land where we're going to
[28:16] see him you know you can't come in
[28:18] without
[28:20] reservations and you haven't made them
[28:22] yet but you would like to be remembered
[28:25] in prayer now that everything will be
[28:28] made right between you and God tonight

[37:47] of Joel very
[37:51] strange brother Ted Dudley if you're
[37:54] listening in tonight over in Phoenix you
[37:56] remember you and I talking one time
[37:59] about a week or two ago and we referred
[38:01] to this I told you someday that would
[38:04] become a text to me and I want to use it
[38:08] tonight then
[38:10] answered then job answered the Lord and
[38:13] said listen close to this reading now I
[38:16] know that thou can do
[38:20] everything and that no doubt can be
[38:23] withholden from
[38:26] thee who is he that hideth counsel
[38:29] without
[38:31] knowledge therefore have I uttered that
[38:34] I understood not things too wonderful
[38:37] for me which I knew
[38:39] not here I beseech thee and I will speak
[38:45] I will demand of thee and declare thou
[38:48] unto me I have heard of thee by the
[38:52] hearing of the ear but now mine eye
[38:57] seeth
[38:59] thee wherefore I aror myself and repent
[39:04] and Dustin ashes now I want to take a
[39:07] text from that fifth verse I have heard
[39:11] of thee by the hearing of the ear but
[39:14] now my ey seeth
[39:18] thee may the Lord bless his
[39:21] word job let's take a little of his life
[39:26] job was a
[39:28] prophet he was a man that lived back
[39:31] before the Bible was written it's been
[39:34] thought that job was one of the oldest
[39:36] books of the Bible because it was
[39:39] written before Genesis was
[39:42] written job this great warrior and
[39:46] Prophet was a a mighty man in his day no
[39:51] doubt that he had been brought
[39:53] up and had served the Lord all of his
[39:56] life
[39:58] and to live such a gallant life to the
[40:02] people all had respects for him but he'
[40:05] come to a place to where he calls it
[40:08] you're being tempted of the Lord but I'd
[40:12] like to use the word being tested by the
[40:15] Lord and truly every son that cometh to
[40:19] God must first be
[40:21] tested
[40:23] tried child trained and then if if the
[40:27] testing gets hard and we think it's too
[40:30] hard and won't listen take heed then he
[40:33] said we become uh illegitimate child and
[40:37] not a child of God because there's
[40:39] nothing can move a real Born Again child
[40:43] of God away from his
[40:45] parents he's part of it you can no more
[40:48] denight you can deny yourself see you've
[40:51] had the experience you've been trained
[40:54] and tested
[40:57] and now this man being a prophet he had
[41:01] had access to God's
[41:04] grace but job didn't have a bible to
[41:08] read he the Bible wasn't wrote
[41:12] then but he had access to God by
[41:17] Revelation and by
[41:19] Vision that's before the Bible was
[41:22] written now we find out take some of his
[41:26] life when God blessed him and made him a
[41:28] great man while even everybody respected
[41:32] him even to his wisdom had become so
[41:35] great is inspiration from God had
[41:39] Vindicated him to be God's servant so
[41:42] plainly until the people come from
[41:46] everywhere to hear
[41:48] him and then Satan begin to accuse that
[41:52] man and that's the what he does ever
[41:55] inspired servant of God Satan is always
[41:59] there to accuse him of everything that
[42:02] he does that's not
[42:04] right now we find out uh his life and
[42:08] trials and his great faith even Jesus
[42:10] when he came on the earth he uh referred
[42:14] to the patience of Job he said have you
[42:17] not read of the patience of Job Faith
[42:20] Waits with patience for the promise word
[42:24] to be
[42:25] fulfilled now we notice here that job
[42:29] after he went through his trials all of
[42:32] his afflictions he had a lovely family
[42:34] they were taken from him he had good
[42:37] health it was taken from him everything
[42:39] that he owned in this life was taken and
[42:42] he set on a as sheep with a piece of
[42:45] Croc scraping his bars and even to his
[42:48] own wife spoke against him she said uh
[42:52] why not curse God and die he said thou
[42:55] speakest like a foolish woman
[42:58] he said the lord gave and the Lord taken
[43:00] away blessed be the name of the Lord now
[43:03] Satan had come up before God because he
[43:07] could come before God and accuse the
[43:10] Christians or the Believers all the time
[43:12] so he accused job of many things and
[43:16] said it's job the reason he could serve
[43:18] God because everything was coming good
[43:20] for him but said if you'll just let me
[43:22] have him in my hands I'll make him curse
[43:26] you to your face face I want you to
[43:29] notice that the confidence that God had
[43:32] in a
[43:34] Believer see he's in other words God
[43:37] said to Job or said to Satan like this
[43:40] you can't do
[43:41] it he's a just man Justified he is a
[43:46] good man he there's not one like him in
[43:50] the whole
[43:51] earth oh what a
[43:54] man and God himself would say to his
[43:57] enemy my servant is so perfect there's
[44:00] not another man on earth like
[44:02] him oh if we could only be that kind of
[44:05] a man God could bestow that confidence
[44:09] upon us that no that will not Twist from
[44:13] his word or his being anyway stay
[44:16] exactly and he can put his trust in
[44:20] us now job was a man that carried out
[44:24] God's Commandments to the letter exactly
[44:28] and Satan knew that but he said if you
[44:30] just let me have him I'll make him curse
[44:32] you to your face so God told him he said
[44:35] now he's in your hands but don't you
[44:37] take his life and Satan even stretched
[44:41] as far as he could on that he took every
[44:45] friend and everything he had almost his
[44:48] complete
[44:49] life but he couldn't take his life but
[44:52] job still help right
[44:55] on there was no no turning back you see
[45:00] when a man or a person has once really
[45:04] come in contact with god with that
[45:08] genuine reveal faith that God is there's
[45:13] nothing no time nowhere can ever
[45:16] separate that man from his God I believe
[45:20] as Paul said there's no Strife no hunger
[45:22] no Peril NE neither living creatures or
[45:25] death or anything
[45:27] that can separate us from the love of
[45:29] God which is in Christ
[45:31] Jesus you are securely anchored in him
[45:37] because you were ordained to that life
[45:40] but Satan thought he could twist him
[45:41] around a little bit and cuff him up and
[45:44] make him do it but you see job with his
[45:48] perfect revelation of God and who God
[45:51] was and how God loved him he waited no
[45:55] matter what the circumstances was he
[45:57] waited for his faith to be
[46:00] confirmed because it had a grip on God a
[46:05] revelation that I spoke of last night
[46:08] now when the sick people that's in the
[46:11] building the crippled
[46:13] people or you that have a need of God
[46:16] when you can get that type of a
[46:19] revelation that you are
[46:22] Justified when you are actually
[46:25] Justified
[46:27] and asking the thing that you're asking
[46:30] for and believe that he is a rewarder of
[46:33] those that diligently seek after him
[46:36] there's nothing can ever separate you
[46:38] from that Faith that's anchored to
[46:41] you but first it has to be revealed to
[46:44] you someone come not long ago a group of
[46:47] man some of them listening in tonight
[46:50] and told me said I kept telling him go
[46:52] to Kentucky orals down there I knew it
[46:55] was I seen it in the vision well brother
[46:58] Deus them didn't go for a long time
[47:00] after a while finally they said after
[47:03] Texas had moved in and they said uh now
[47:06] we're going down I said you ought to
[47:08] went a long time ago but they didn't do
[47:11] it demon said I made a great mistake in
[47:13] that we're not doing that brother Bram I
[47:15] said if you'd went down there You' have
[47:17] had it all well they wouldn't listen to
[47:19] it then the first then before we left
[47:22] that night the the place where we're
[47:25] having lunch the the Holy Spirit showed
[47:27] me a great uh crack in the earth and in
[47:31] that was full of oil and these overflows
[47:34] in Kentucky was just little beds of O
[47:36] that they were pumping from but this one
[47:39] come from the
[47:40] mainstream and I said brother Deus it's
[47:43] there so they went to searching for said
[47:46] go down and tell us where the word where
[47:48] the rool is I said oh no no see we don't
[47:52] use a gift of God for commercial no no
[47:56] he could tell many work was that but I
[47:58] don't have any need of it I wouldn't
[47:59] have faith enough to ask him see if I
[48:02] had a need of it I believe i' ask him
[48:05] you tell me but first you see your
[48:07] motives and objectives has to be right
[48:10] you have to have reasons for this God
[48:13] don't give you those things just because
[48:15] you ask and you cannot ask in faith
[48:17] unless there's a real objective to that
[48:20] to be in the will of God lord see if you
[48:23] want to be well what do you want to be
[48:25] well for
[48:28] if you want to be healed what's the
[48:29] reason you want to be
[48:31] healed what are you telling God what do
[48:33] you want to do with your life when you
[48:34] get
[48:35] healed there's got to be You' got to
[48:37] have a motive and objective and they
[48:39] have to be right according to the will
[48:41] of God and then when the faith is
[48:43] revealed to you and God by Sovereign
[48:45] Grace places that faith in there then
[48:47] it's
[48:48] over now see now to make that word true
[48:52] when the Brethren got down there they
[48:53] got one fellow went over and bought a
[48:55] bunch of stuff and so Le and cheated the
[48:57] other one this way I said you see it
[49:00] won't work now is to make the prophecy
[49:03] sure within a 100 yards of where these
[49:06] men were digging their well some men
[49:08] struck the big gusher and it's there
[49:11] 1100 barrels or in a half a day or
[49:14] something like it still putting it out
[49:16] right in that mainstream but just to
[49:17] make the prophecy the word that had been
[49:20] said that it was there it was there the
[49:22] rest of them nearly is all dried up
[49:23] everywhere through Kentucky little ponds
[49:25] they pump them a little while they go
[49:26] it's only the Overflow from this see but
[49:30] because of the selfishness got among it
[49:33] the objectives was wrong signing up a
[49:36] bunch of stuff that would be this way
[49:38] when they promised they would do it for
[49:39] the kingdom of God but look like it's
[49:42] for
[49:43] themselves and it won't
[49:45] work no selfish thing will work your
[49:48] motives and objectives has to be exactly
[49:51] perfectly right then you have faith as
[49:54] if our hearts condemn us not then we
[49:56] have
[49:57] confidence see we've got to have
[49:59] confidence I want this to the honor and
[50:01] glory of God then faith has a a channel
[50:05] to move into if it doesn't then you've
[50:08] got mental intellectual faith and not
[50:10] genuine Faith from God that intellectual
[50:13] faith will get you nowhere might get you
[50:16] emotional but it won't get you the
[50:17] healing that you're looking for so job
[50:21] checking himself with the genuine faith
[50:24] that God had give to him that he was
[50:26] just that he had done everything that
[50:29] God required him to do now when we're
[50:33] going to be prayed for for our sickness
[50:36] I wonder if we have done everything that
[50:40] God requires us to do have we followed
[50:43] every iot of the scripture have we give
[50:46] him our hearts and lives to
[50:49] service what's the reason you want to be
[50:52] healed that's the reason you can't get
[50:54] Faith enough see because you have
[50:56] haven't maybe made this thing to God
[50:59] sincerely from your
[51:00] heart like Hezekiah did give God the
[51:04] reason he want to set his kingdom in
[51:06] order and God sent his Prophet back told
[51:08] him and he'd be healed see but you have
[51:10] to have those things made right first so
[51:13] then as soon as you get to these places
[51:16] and know that's been revealed to you by
[51:19] the word of God by the Revelation by the
[51:22] word that God requires you to do then
[51:25] you have faith genuine Faith now just
[51:28] like Abraham when he was uh 99 years old
[51:32] I believe Genesis
[51:34] 17 God appeared to this old man now 9
[51:38] and9 years old when he was almost 100
[51:41] years old that had been waiting upon
[51:44] that promise all these years he appeared
[51:47] to him in the name of el Sharad the
[51:51] breasted one and what an encouragement
[51:54] it was yet the promise wasn't fulfill
[51:57] then but Abraham I am the almighty
[52:02] God
[52:03] elsh the strength Giver the breasted God
[52:08] like I've told you before like the
[52:10] little baby that's threatening sick and
[52:12] crying and it lays upon its mother's
[52:15] breast and nurses its strength back from
[52:19] her because it's satisfied while it's a
[52:23] nursing because the only ACC say it has
[52:27] and knows of is a mother's
[52:29] breast it knows no dose of
[52:34] medicine you might give him a dose Med
[52:36] squeal and cry give him a shot in the
[52:39] arm and he carry on but the only access
[52:42] to satisfy him is a mother's
[52:45] breast and he said Abraham you're old
[52:49] your strength is gone your arms are
[52:51] withered up your manhood is gone but I
[52:55] am your
[52:58] mother just take a hold of my promise
[53:02] and be satisfied while you're
[53:04] waiting be arrested now that's way every
[53:07] believer no matter how bad the Cancer's
[53:10] got you how long you've been sitting in
[53:12] a wheelchair any of those things just if
[53:14] you can
[53:17] grasp that Revelation from
[53:20] God then be
[53:23] satisfied knowing that it's going to
[53:25] happen because Faith Waits patiently for
[53:31] the
[53:32] promise
[53:34] job knew that he was right when we find
[53:38] out here in the scriptures that there
[53:41] was these fellows come to him his church
[53:44] members everything that once seemed dear
[53:47] to him had turned against
[53:49] him and tried to accuse him of being a
[53:51] secret sinner because all these things
[53:53] that happened to him you hear people y
[53:56] today say I told you look at him you see
[53:58] what that ain't alltogether the truth
[54:00] sometimes it's God testing his people in
[54:02] this case it was God testing job the
[54:05] best man there was on Earth at the time
[54:07] now he was holding him there because
[54:11] that he knew Job was a prophet that had
[54:15] a vision from God that he had exactly
[54:18] done what God told him to do and he God
[54:21] was Duty
[54:22] bound to keep his promise to him
[54:26] all all Christians has got to be that
[54:28] when the last struggle of our life comes
[54:31] and death rattles are in her throat we
[54:34] still must hold study and remember that
[54:37] God said I'll raise you up again at the
[54:39] last
[54:41] day got to hold that that our testimony
[54:45] our place in Christ our position what we
[54:48] are knowing that we have kept every word
[54:52] of his commandment blessed are they that
[54:54] do his Commandments that they might have
[54:56] the right to enter in see and when we
[54:59] know that no matter what anyone has said
[55:02] we've kept every Commandment that we see
[55:04] in the Bible that God has done us told
[55:07] us to do with reverence and love and
[55:10] respect to the Creator who wrote the
[55:13] Bible we say man wrote it man of old
[55:16] moved by the Holy Ghost wrote it God
[55:19] wrote it through man like a prophet
[55:20] speaks his word it's not the prophet's
[55:22] word it's God's word see through the
[55:25] prophet that's the reason it has to to
[55:26] come to pass if it's truly the truth now
[55:30] we see this great man and remember job
[55:33] had no bible to read in his day no he
[55:37] only went by inspiration he was a
[55:39] prophet to whom the word of the Lord
[55:41] comes to he had he had only to be
[55:47] inspired because he know his position
[55:50] that he was God's Prophet now the only
[55:54] thing had to happen was for the in
[55:56] insiration to strike him and then he
[55:59] know what he said would happen because
[56:03] it was by inspiration that's what the
[56:05] church if it's an order set in order it
[56:08] only it's got the mechanics ready it
[56:10] only needs in the
[56:12] Dynamics tonight if we'll get the
[56:15] mechanics ready get our hearts right the
[56:17] things that we can do follow every word
[56:20] follow him in baptism follow him in
[56:21] every order that he told us to do get
[56:24] every mechanic ready and stand there
[56:26] then we're ready for the Dynamics to be
[56:28] lit off and only God can do that and
[56:31] that's to drop into your heart that
[56:34] faith that says I am now
[56:36] healed that don't make any difference
[56:38] what circumstances is you're healed
[56:41] anyhow C his faith by faith you're
[56:44] healed he had a Channel of communication
[56:47] to God that he got by inspiration he had
[56:50] a way of moving himself out and letting
[56:53] God move in and he know he was was
[56:57] justified it was a gift it was a gift
[57:00] for the people not for job but for the
[57:02] people that's what all Divine gifts are
[57:05] to serve God's people with everybody's
[57:08] not ordered to be a prophet all's not
[57:11] ordered to be pray for the sick all of
[57:14] them is not ordered to be pastors and so
[57:16] forth but it's a channel that God is
[57:18] open to them and he is we had this
[57:21] morning in the lesson that he one man
[57:23] has no business deviating in next man's
[57:26] Channel no matter how inspired how much
[57:29] it seems how well how many is at the
[57:31] meeting this morning let's see your hand
[57:33] see see you cannot there's David just as
[57:36] inspired as he could be all the people
[57:38] shouting and glorifying God for a reason
[57:40] that seemed exactly scripture but he was
[57:43] a wrong person that inspiration should
[57:46] have come to Nathan not David he never
[57:49] even consulted Nathan you see what
[57:51] happened we have God said he does
[57:54] nothing until he reveals it to his
[57:55] servants the prophets and job was this
[57:58] prophet in this day now only thing God
[58:01] had done to job had always give him
[58:05] wisdom and his word and inspiration he
[58:08] could get no
[58:10] inspiration but he know all of his
[58:13] mechanics he had offered the burnt
[58:14] offering he had done everything he know
[58:16] to he was right but he couldn't get a
[58:18] word from God but the devil couldn't
[58:21] move him there you are now there you are
[58:24] when you're prayed for you don't have to
[58:26] run back to a line or go let somebody
[58:28] else pray for you when you know you've
[58:31] done exactly what God told you to do see
[58:35] then wait for that channel of
[58:37] inspiration to open up to you now I'm
[58:41] Healed when it drops in there then it's
[58:43] all over oh you don't need no prayer
[58:45] lines nothing else it's over it's been
[58:47] revealed to
[58:50] you just
[58:52] like the old
[58:54] Prophet at the coming of the Lord
[58:57] Jesus we find out it was revealed to him
[59:00] the old sage that he would not see death
[59:04] until he seen the Lord's
[59:06] Christ and he believed that and he
[59:10] waited for it and the people thought he
[59:12] was crazy the old man had lost his mind
[59:14] but he still believed it nothing could
[59:17] Shak him from it he know God had
[59:19] revealed it to him where the Bible said
[59:21] it was revealed to him by the Holy
[59:23] Ghost some you coming into the temple
[59:26] that minut walked over and give praise
[59:28] to God and said let thy servant depart
[59:29] in peace when he picked up the baby mine
[59:32] eyes have seen thy
[59:34] salvation he know he was going to see it
[59:37] no matter how many babies he visited
[59:39] each day he knew God had revealed to him
[59:42] that he was going to see the Christ
[59:44] before he
[59:46] died Simon believe that now when it's
[59:49] reveal to you that you
[59:53] yourself has received God's promise the
[59:57] inspiration you being Christians it
[1:00:00] struck
[1:00:01] you you don't even need a prayer line
[1:00:04] the thing only thing you need is a open
[1:00:07] heart when all the mechanics are ready
[1:00:09] and let the inspiration drop in and then
[1:00:11] nothing can change your
[1:00:13] mind you've got it outside of that it
[1:00:15] won't do no good now notice job needed a
[1:00:20] Channel of inspiration he had it open he
[1:00:24] had a channel to communicate with God by
[1:00:27] his inspiration he had a way of moving
[1:00:30] himself out and let the word of God move
[1:00:32] in notice how they how they come to
[1:00:36] consult him from the East and from the
[1:00:39] West people looking for him because they
[1:00:42] know that what job said was the
[1:00:45] truth they know that man told the truth
[1:00:48] because what he prophesied that's what
[1:00:51] happened and so people come from the
[1:00:53] East and West he said he go to the
[1:00:55] market the young princes from the East
[1:00:57] would bow before him just to hear one
[1:01:00] word of consolation from him Great
[1:01:03] Mighty wisdom because they know the man
[1:01:05] was honest he didn't want to boast up
[1:01:08] himself he had no access to grind no
[1:01:12] strings to pull he's just an honest
[1:01:14] Prophet before God Amen and they had
[1:01:16] confidence in him amen and everybody
[1:01:19] come from east and west just to speak to
[1:01:21] him in a moment he spoke of in the Bible
[1:01:23] here but you see he like
[1:01:26] inspiration to tell him what all this
[1:01:29] was about God let it happen didn't tell
[1:01:31] him then one day we find out that in
[1:01:35] that that's a time that everybody as
[1:01:37] long as you can help them all right but
[1:01:40] when they want to disagree with you
[1:01:42] that's when trouble comes in but he
[1:01:44] alone knew he was right his pulsation of
[1:01:47] faith of hearing God words speak to him
[1:01:51] he knew it was the truth yes sir he knew
[1:01:54] God's voice nobody can fool him on it
[1:01:57] before he knew it it but whenever you
[1:02:00] something's revealed to you maybe
[1:02:03] contrary to what the people
[1:02:06] think I'm speaking a line of prophets
[1:02:09] once God reveals something which if
[1:02:11] there ever is a secret comes out from
[1:02:14] God to be made known to the people it
[1:02:17] will never come through a seminary it
[1:02:20] will never come through a group of
[1:02:21] people it never did it always will
[1:02:25] happen has and will through one
[1:02:27] individual a prophet Amos 3:7 see the
[1:02:32] Lord does nothing except first he
[1:02:35] reveals it through His prophets amen and
[1:02:38] now job had something wrong with him but
[1:02:42] he couldn't get the inspiration on
[1:02:45] him and he was wearing him and that when
[1:02:48] you get in that kind of fix that's when
[1:02:51] the enemy moves in to every friend near
[1:02:53] to you God they begin to accuse him oh
[1:02:56] it must have been a miserable thing for
[1:02:58] him and know his friends that accused
[1:03:00] him Satan then goes and joins himself
[1:03:03] with the Enemy that's when Satan comes
[1:03:06] in let me have him and I'll make him
[1:03:09] curse you to I'll make him deny his
[1:03:12] message I'll make him curse you I'll
[1:03:14] make him go back and say it was all
[1:03:17] wrong then he tried him with everything
[1:03:20] he could to all the great man and the
[1:03:22] friends that he used to have but job
[1:03:24] stood flat footed for he knew he had
[1:03:29] heard God's
[1:03:33] voice oh God help tomorrow night I get
[1:03:36] that wings of the
[1:03:38] D I heard the voice of God that said
[1:03:42] something and it's going to happen that
[1:03:45] way just the same as these other things
[1:03:47] has happened it's going to
[1:03:52] happen
[1:03:53] now job knew it was going to
[1:03:56] happened and he know that God had told
[1:03:59] him that that he was just but they made
[1:04:01] him a sinner so he waited then for the
[1:04:04] inspiration Satan getting all the the
[1:04:07] people and he come around his comforters
[1:04:10] so-called and accus him but he didn't
[1:04:12] move him a bit but when the word of God
[1:04:16] became Vindicated to him he had heard of
[1:04:20] God by the hearing of the ear but one
[1:04:23] day setting out at his lowest point
[1:04:26] and while he was sitting there and
[1:04:28] everyone accusing him even his wife
[1:04:30] telling him he was wrong he's scraping
[1:04:33] his
[1:04:34] boils and elu came down and rebuked him
[1:04:37] for being selfish about the way he was
[1:04:40] accusing God and so forth and then at
[1:04:43] that time it was when inspiration struck
[1:04:47] him that's when the lightning begin to
[1:04:50] flash the Thunders begin to Roar that's
[1:04:54] when the inspiration struck the prophet
[1:04:56] and he raised up and he said I know my
[1:04:59] redeemer liveth and at the last days
[1:05:02] he'll stand upon this Earth though the
[1:05:04] skin worms destroys this body yet in my
[1:05:07] flesh shall I see God whom I shall see
[1:05:10] for
[1:05:11] myself he saw he been talking about the
[1:05:13] trees the botney life hi dies and lives
[1:05:17] again water brings it back again the
[1:05:19] smell of water the scent of water the
[1:05:21] results of water pouring upon a tree or
[1:05:24] something or seed that went under the
[1:05:25] ground he said but a man layeth down he
[1:05:28] giveth up the ghost his children come to
[1:05:29] honor him he perceiveth not oh thou hide
[1:05:32] me in the grave Job 14 till thy wrath be
[1:05:34] passed he said but if a man dies shall
[1:05:36] he live again all the appointed times of
[1:05:39] my life I'll wait till my change comes
[1:05:42] thou will call me and I'll answer th
[1:05:44] appoint me bounds that I cannot pass so
[1:05:47] forth he know all these things he
[1:05:48] watched a tree live but what happened to
[1:05:50] a man when he died he didn't raise up
[1:05:53] again so God was showing this
[1:05:56] Redeemer he wanted to see if there was
[1:05:58] somebody who could intercede for him he
[1:06:01] had interceded for so many people but
[1:06:04] now is there somebody can speak for him
[1:06:07] could there somebody put his hand on job
[1:06:09] or on a sinful man and a holy God and
[1:06:11] make Bridge the way could he go to his
[1:06:14] house and knock at the door would he
[1:06:15] open the door and talk to him a while
[1:06:18] but then when the inspiration dropped
[1:06:20] into his heart then he could see God the
[1:06:23] Lightnings are flashing the Thunders are
[1:06:26] roaring and when it did he stood up on
[1:06:29] his feet and he said I know my redeemer
[1:06:31] liveth My Redeemer in the last days
[1:06:34] he'll stand on the earth see he had be
[1:06:36] to see God's reaction to his
[1:06:40] faith now we wonder if we could see God
[1:06:44] Is there a way that we could see
[1:06:46] him
[1:06:48] now it was only way God had trying job
[1:06:51] out he said I have heard of thee with
[1:06:54] the hearing of the ear but now I see
[1:06:57] thee but now I see thee with my eyes the
[1:07:01] vision of the invisible had been made
[1:07:05] plain he seen the cloud rolling around
[1:07:08] you heard the flashing of the lightning
[1:07:11] or saw it and seen the rolling of the
[1:07:13] Thunder maybe on a clear day and he seen
[1:07:16] God was in that cloud and in that
[1:07:18] lightning he could see God with his
[1:07:20] natural ey see because the invisible was
[1:07:24] made visible the visible vision of
[1:07:27] others was then Vindicated clear to the
[1:07:30] Natural Eye just like Faith with works
[1:07:34] as we spoke on last night Abraham no had
[1:07:37] no bible to read either but he was a
[1:07:40] prophet his vision and his faith and it
[1:07:44] seemed wrong to others that he should
[1:07:47] think that way that he should think
[1:07:49] there going to have a baby but they did
[1:07:51] have the baby because his vision of the
[1:07:54] baby
[1:07:55] was what he was talking about I'm going
[1:07:57] to have it I'm going to have it but when
[1:07:59] the baby was born then the other people
[1:08:02] could see with the eye what he saw in a
[1:08:05] vision and when you go to acting upon
[1:08:07] what you believe in your heart then the
[1:08:09] people know God and know what's
[1:08:11] happening to you but the way you act
[1:08:14] that's how you see God with the eye but
[1:08:17] to
[1:08:18] him all he had done that was good all
[1:08:22] that he had done for others he needed
[1:08:24] somebody to intercede for him when the
[1:08:26] birth of the baby come Isaac the um the
[1:08:30] inspiration that had led him to this had
[1:08:33] Vindicated his vision to where the
[1:08:36] people could see that what he had saw in
[1:08:38] a vision was actually the truth now
[1:08:43] sometimes these great pulsations of
[1:08:44] Faith come right in the time of
[1:08:48] Crisis it's usually crisis that drives
[1:08:51] us into this it was a crisis that drove
[1:08:54] job into us Glory why is that the end of
[1:08:57] his life his children was dead his
[1:08:59] camels and all of his Goods was gone and
[1:09:02] destroyed and his own life it broke out
[1:09:04] from the crown of his head to the souls
[1:09:06] of his feet with boils it was a crisis
[1:09:09] that he pressed
[1:09:11] himself there's where the inspiration
[1:09:13] struck you oh man and women tonight if
[1:09:17] you could look around and see how close
[1:09:19] we are to the coming of the Lord you who
[1:09:22] put off the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:09:25] you you may be relied upon some
[1:09:26] sensation or something that you've done
[1:09:28] that Satan can't impersonate and can't
[1:09:31] have the real spirit in you to go all
[1:09:33] the way in God's promises how can a man
[1:09:37] that claims to have the Holy Ghost deny
[1:09:39] one word of this Bible being not
[1:09:42] R you can't do it no matter how
[1:09:45] religious you are how many churches you
[1:09:47] belong to how many books your names on
[1:09:51] if that genuine Holy Ghost is in you
[1:09:53] which is this word man ested you'll see
[1:09:56] the message of the hour because it's the
[1:09:58] holy ghost that does it but there has to
[1:10:01] be something light that off inspiration
[1:10:04] strike you and if there's if you pour
[1:10:07] water on the ground on the ground on the
[1:10:08] ground and there's no seed in there to
[1:10:10] strike it how can it ever bring forth
[1:10:13] anything there's nothing there to bring
[1:10:15] forth that is that only the elected of
[1:10:19] God will see it the elected of God seen
[1:10:21] it Noah's time Moses time Jesus time the
[1:10:24] apostles time l Luther's time Wesley's
[1:10:26] time Pentecostal time because that was a
[1:10:29] seed that was on the earth when this
[1:10:32] inspiration was poured out now all the
[1:10:34] inspiration poured out together the
[1:10:36] bride
[1:10:37] together it's only those who are elected
[1:10:40] will see it Jesus said I thank thee
[1:10:42] father that thou has hid these things
[1:10:43] from the eyes of the wise and prudent
[1:10:45] and reveal it to Bab such as learn now
[1:10:49] inspiration has to strike it now when
[1:10:51] the inspiration struck him that did it
[1:10:54] he had it then
[1:10:55] now we find out it comes a time of these
[1:10:59] crisis when the Press is right on and
[1:11:02] you look around today look at the
[1:11:05] condition we're living in aren't we
[1:11:07] living in a modern Sodom and
[1:11:10] Gomorrah hasn't the world come back that
[1:11:13] was a gentile world that was destroyed
[1:11:15] then by fire didn't Jesus say in St Luke
[1:11:19] the 17th chapter the 28th 29th and 30th
[1:11:23] verse that as it was was in the days of
[1:11:28] Sodom so shall it be in the coming of
[1:11:31] the son of man when the son of man is
[1:11:33] being
[1:11:34] revealed what is a revealed is a secret
[1:11:38] made
[1:11:39] known a revelation is to reveal or make
[1:11:44] known a secret now these things that's
[1:11:47] been hid all through the church ages is
[1:11:50] now being
[1:11:51] revealed made known now we can say that
[1:11:54] and if God didn't back that up that's
[1:11:57] wrong see God don't need anybody to
[1:12:00] interpret his word he's his own
[1:12:03] interpreter he said a virgin shall
[1:12:05] conceive and she did he said let there
[1:12:08] be light and there was and we are not
[1:12:11] living in Luther's age Wesley age or the
[1:12:15] Pentecostal age the Pentecostal age is
[1:12:17] only a restoration of the gifts coming
[1:12:19] back to the church but we're living in
[1:12:22] the evening time we're living in the
[1:12:24] time of the calling out of the Bride
[1:12:27] just as it was hard for the Catholics to
[1:12:29] see Luther and the Lutheran to see the
[1:12:31] Wesley and the Pentecost West is to see
[1:12:34] the Pentecostal age so is it hard for
[1:12:37] the Pentecostals to see this age it's
[1:12:40] always been that way because it's poured
[1:12:42] out upon an elected
[1:12:44] seedall and not only what the Bible
[1:12:48] teaches they can't see it Jesus even
[1:12:51] prayed for them said there's blind in
[1:12:55] didn't know it Revelations tells us in
[1:12:57] this lady of see Church age when he was
[1:12:59] put out of the church that they're naked
[1:13:01] poor miserable
[1:13:03] blind and don't know
[1:13:05] it back again they can't see it can't
[1:13:09] understand it they're so creeped up in
[1:13:11] Traditions but remember the promised
[1:13:14] word of God by the mouth of Jesus
[1:13:18] Christ the very God that spoke creation
[1:13:21] into existence he was the one before the
[1:13:24] foundation to the world that spoke the
[1:13:26] words of Let There Be and there was or
[1:13:29] he said he was in the world and the
[1:13:31] world was made by him and the world knew
[1:13:33] him not but as many as did know him to
[1:13:37] them he gave the power to become the
[1:13:38] sons of God the very Creator and the
[1:13:41] Very Creator himself when he raised up
[1:13:44] Lazarus from the dead he said think this
[1:13:46] not strange for the hour is coming that
[1:13:49] when all that's in the grave will hear
[1:13:51] the voice of the son of man and shall
[1:13:53] come out the very God that said let
[1:13:56] there be light said the voice of the son
[1:13:59] of man would wake those that are in the
[1:14:01] grave it has to happen in its season
[1:14:06] amen he spoke Let There Be male and
[1:14:09] female and so forth and all this years
[1:14:12] and hundreds of years before it happened
[1:14:15] the inspiration hit the prophet Isaiah
[1:14:17] he said unto us a child is born a son is
[1:14:19] given his name Shall be Called counselor
[1:14:22] Prince of Peace the Mighty God the
[1:14:24] Everlasting father
[1:14:26] years pass months years days weeks years
[1:14:30] Roll by hundreds of years Roll by 800
[1:14:35] years
[1:14:36] later Emmanuel was born by a virgin why
[1:14:40] is because it was spoke by the lips of
[1:14:44] God's anointed Prophet a seed went
[1:14:48] forth
[1:14:50] see that great hour said will you seek
[1:14:54] ask me of a Vision or sign he said I'll
[1:14:57] give him a sign an everlasting sign the
[1:15:00] Virgin shall conceive an everlasting
[1:15:03] sign now we find in those
[1:15:06] hours of real stress that's usually when
[1:15:10] the spirit of God moves in you let the
[1:15:13] Hebrew children walk right into the
[1:15:15] fiery furnace before he ever moved a
[1:15:17] hand but when he moved he
[1:15:20] moves now we notice here that in Luke
[1:15:25] the the 17th chapter and the 30th verse
[1:15:30] that he said in the last days that the
[1:15:32] son of man would reveal himself as he
[1:15:35] did just before Sodom and Gomorrah and
[1:15:40] the same conditions would exist you told
[1:15:43] about Moses about and I beg your pardon
[1:15:45] not about Moses uh but about Noah how
[1:15:49] that the people was eating drinking and
[1:15:51] so forth married and giving a
[1:15:53] marriage then he come around he said now
[1:15:55] as it was in the days of
[1:15:59] lot so shall it be at the time when the
[1:16:04] son of man is being
[1:16:08] revealed now watch the son of man was
[1:16:11] revealed to Abraham's group as a man a
[1:16:16] prophet in a form of human flesh a
[1:16:20] ordinary man with dust on his
[1:16:22] clothes and Abraham called called him
[1:16:26] Elohim now Jesus promises here that in
[1:16:29] the last days the son of man will be
[1:16:33] revealed again to that same type of
[1:16:36] group The Royal Seed of Abraham just
[1:16:39] before the farf Falls remember the
[1:16:42] church never received any more witness
[1:16:45] Abraham and then then the promised son
[1:16:47] that they were looking for was brought
[1:16:50] right away after that and the church is
[1:16:52] looking for the promised son he will
[1:16:54] come right after the days of this
[1:16:57] ministry to be revealed from the heavens
[1:17:00] now we see it too plain it's got to be
[1:17:02] now the only thing there has to be is
[1:17:05] something
[1:17:06] pulsates gets into a man God vindicate
[1:17:11] and tells him and shows him that that is
[1:17:13] a thing to happen and you you're go to
[1:17:15] like MO
