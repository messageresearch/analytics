about your scientific discoveries yeah but i see you did call me ten times i did ten texts ten texts for the chess meeting tonight oh well let me go get ready and we will go to chess okay sounds very good and where are you going exactly professor i am looking for my lucky sock ah the lucky sock for chess hi nope not there not there definitely not that has anybody seen my lucky socks who said i have a camelback i do not have a camel back i do not have a big back either professor professor they're not saying you have a big back or a camelback how dare you it's it's on your back tell the professor he has a big bag can i show him yeah who put my lucky sock on my back i don't know who could it have been this sock can walk on its own it's true i've seen it happen it was an experiment gone wrong a few days ago it's very crusty and stinky and it's athletic it's got athlete's foot you know they say that if it has athlete's food it's always on the run and you professor are most certainly on the run always i'm always on the run from the devil very good you know it's funny you mentioned that i actually have a story i would just love to tell you that's in that same realm i'm sure you would you're always full of stories that's what they tell me you are a great story man thank you would you like to hear this one i don't think i would but do i have a choice i don't yeah i i don't have time you know what if that's so bad because now you have to know you know what this is professor you gotta understand this is one of those stories you're gonna want to sit down okay this is a story worthy enough to sit around a campfire and just looks like exactly a metaphorical one not real oxygen exactly yes that's one of the elements okay go on i can't remember the rest of the compound but i know what you so it's a metaphorical yes campfire metaphorical campfire where you look the person across you in the eye and you just get told a good store well i don't know which eye to look at this one's twitching at me i don't know if i want to look at this one or that one it wasn't twitching before you said anything listen but it doesn't matter just pick an eye okay right i like that yeah i'll go the right time right my way my right or your right your left my right my so my left is that your left wait hang on face this way turn around okay other way reverse oh okay my left got it okay well listen i'll get to telling the story because boy you're gonna you're already sitting down it's time to get on i'm not going to sit long so what's the get what you catch well it happened about the year 2020 last year now listen though 2020 was many things and lots of things changed one thing stayed exactly the same and that thing was the great outdoors what is the title of your story oh right that thing that's important have you ever heard the tale of remember the book uh i've heard remember the duck no no remember the book it's a different maybe it's because his earphones there we go that's perfect remember the remember noise cancellation i could not hear you so i've heard the story remember the duck my pastor told me that story i've heard that's what it sounds like okay yes okay i have not heard your story oh i guess i'll hear it okay great well now you'll never forget the buck or the duck either okay okay where was i right 20 20. let's back up a little bit this 2020. lots of things have changed but one thing that had not changed was nature the great outdoors beautiful astounding world of i'll be back opening of god's creation keep talking boy great you know i'm glad you're all here this would have been a really short story it was 2020 and me and my brother paula decided to go on a hunt now the hunt was an excellent hunt because we happened to know a very wonderful rancher he was nice enough to let us go on the property and go on a private hunt on his land you have to understand this land wasn't just any land this was prime buck country there were bucks the size of antelopes and if you've never seen an antelope there was some the size of cows and if you've ever seen a cow where have you been they were massive 12 point bucks beautiful things and the rancher was kind enough to let us come on his property and hunt one single buck just one he was very very close to this butt very close unnaturally close go get it come on going against the forces of nature close it almost didn't seem real i mean i don't even know what else to say at this point easy and as you can see the rancher loved dear old snowflake his most prized deer of all his most prized buck in all this land and so as we met him and we walked up to the rancher i'll never forget the words that he said to me a set of unforgettable words to both me and paul and those words were well hello gentlemen how are you doing sir yes monster right what's your name young man pleasure to meet you absolute president i want you boys to have the best time of your life that's best wow have a good time yeah go camping fishing hunting okay whatever you always do whatever yes but have one condition okay one condition that's the one yes you don't touch my old snowflake don't don't even look it okay you don't shoot him you don't look at him right nothing off territory but other than that thank you so much and with that we were off me and paul on a hunting trip like never before and we did certainly camp wherever we pleased we fished wherever we pleased and we certainly did whatever we please you can do in the woods there's not much we discovered but three days of hunting had gone by and not a single buck was found nothing absolutely not the fourth day came around and we decided with the genius plan i said all you know we should do we should uh split up and just cover more territories last day of the hunt let's see if we can find some i think that's a good idea okay scooby-doo so we did we split up and i went on my way through the woodland lands don't worry it's loaded i went through the lands scouting watching waiting for something and lo and behold as i lifted my scope up there was a buck it had 12 points it was a massive beast it was my time to shine it was the one that god had gifted me but as it turned around it had a white face and thus it was snowflake i was devastated how could this happen to me but you know what here's the thing snowflake was 2000 yards away the farthest i ever shot was 200 i thought well i mean what are the odds that i would actually make this shot i mean what's the worst that could happen the famous last words of anybody that anyone can say so i lifted my rifle i aimed at snowflake calculated for the distance calculated for the wind recalculated because i did it wrong and with that i said clam [Music] what a shot [Applause] an instance of terror came upon me an instance of terror what can i do how is this even possible i checked again it was true so i ran 2 000 yards in five minutes never seen before in human history and i made it to snowflake and there he was dead as a doornail i looked around there was no one that could be seen i said well maybe it's not the end of the world yet perhaps what we do is we relocate the creature i mean what's the worst that could happen no one's seen anything yet i mean after all other than the uh 200 people in this building no one could have possibly seen me i found a good place to let snowflake rest and thus i pulled out my handy-dandy metaphorical shovel and got to digging slowly but surely digging deeper and deeper into the ground until it was deep enough to or deep enough to hold this massive creature i pulled snowflake in put him in the hole and huzzah i'm out of trouble guiltless no one ever saw anything that i did who could possibly have seen this act and as i turned around you killed snowflake no no you did you just get a snowflake how do you know how do i know where's your proof what are you doing oh come on that's my proof that's great listen you can't tell anyone about this paul if you tell anyone what happened here today will never be allowed to come back on this ranch i will die of embarrassment i have to be buried in another country in the hole the size of snowflakes you understand what this means oh i won't tell and paul slurped away evilly and was often his own in the woods i thought well i might as well keep burying snowflake i mean surely i can trust my brother he is my brother after all no brother would ever betray another and with that snowflake was buried and the hunt was over two days had passed and on the monday after it happened all at a basketball game however i had work and we both well only paul really had chores at the time as we were walking away and i was on my way to work i'll never forget what paul said to me he said hey jules so uh you know i got a basketball game tonight i also got my chores but i don't really feel like doing them so you're gonna do them right what i have work what are you talking about remember the book [Music] got you with that one and the chores were done for two days these tours were done cleanest floors luckily these ones already pretty clean but the ones that i had cleaned were full of many horrors that paul's room should not have i cleaned and cleaned and cleaned and finally on the third day i was given a chore that was so menacing so terrible that i could not take any more of this and that chore that paul had requested of me was hey joel's uh so you know we have four dogs dog poop so you got to clean that up but we have no bags or gloves so good luck with that i'm gonna go and i just couldn't take it anymore that's ridiculous how could this happen and so in the instance of me needing to make up for my wrongdoings i ran and i ran all the way back to rio doso all those hours of mileage made up in two days of non-stop sprinting straight to the rancher's house and i confronted him and said mr rancher okay waiting for you really wow how'd your hunt go it was great it was great really yeah it was wonderful [Music] i know what you did and it was wrong but i forgive you for what you did you know and next time you come which will be never um i i expect you to respect the rules whether it's here or another ranch's problem okay god bless you thank you i believe you do i know you from somewhere lucious no oh wait wrong story wrong story sorry bit of a throwback there and so i was forgiven finally that burden was lifted off of my back never have to deal with those guilty things again and finally i was free you heard the story right of course of course you were just blabbing on i'm just sitting here thinking to myself why am i friends with such a criminal you should have your license revoked and never to hunt again you know i learned it from i've learned it from my peers so you're saying you're very easily persuaded yes now what what did you say i wasn't you go with the flow like a trout i'm gonna start pointing you the trout the brown drought does it have to be brown i think so what about can we go like a beige no if you keep it up you're going to be the cutthroat trout wow you'll be cut off from my lap okay see that was i was hoping for that one the first one was a little scary okay you know what professor there's one thing yes you know i can't help but think that after all that i really don't understand why the rancher forgave me i don't understand either you would have been shot if it was me but it's not me and that's what's so great about our experiment today oh because if it was me you would not be here right now but i'm going to tell you of a greater power that so few know anything about who can tell me what that power might be you better not say what i think you're going to say it's not thor it's bigger than thor double-a batteries what is my cancellation device anybody yes sir jesus not just jesus but his blood so i'm going to show you julian exactly chemically wise why the rancher forgave you and why you are very lucky today i think that should do it okay so we are all human beings we make mistakes right did you not make a mistake yes several basically all of them you broke all yes we will not go there you did break a lot of them so we all do the same thing right how many your mom tells you okay it's time for bed and you want to continue watching disney plus and you pitch a big feet and you start crying aj [Applause] you start crying because you want to watch more disney plus and you know church is the next day and then you wake up all cranky and you don't want to get dressed and then you're terrible in sunday school and the teachers have to kick you out with the deacons that's what i'm talking about you are this little cup you are a foam cup very soluble full of trash but it's not your fault i must say because we were born in sin shaped in iniquity and unfortunately we have the tendencies to want to lie to cheat maybe you go to school and you cheat on a test maybe you say a bad word or all these things start to pile up in your cup but there comes a time when you're so tired of these things and you know you've messed up and you say lord i do not want to continue cheating on tests i do not want to go and kick my dog when he does not do what i say i don't want to choke out my brother anymore so what you must do is you go to the lord and you tell him these things lord i don't want to continue acting like a beast a scary beast walking around my house all mad i don't want to do that anymore so then what you do is you go to all the people that you did that wrong to because it's okay to pray to jesus but he didn't do nothing to you you go to the ones you did it wrong through so like brother julian went to the rancher and he said i'm sorry i shot your famous snowflake he melted i don't know what to tell you see if he would have just prayed about it the rancher would still be mad but he went to the rancher and said i'm sorry i didn't mean to do that so once you do all those things you go apologize to your dogs and your cats and your teachers and your brothers and sisters and you have all the trash you ask the lord to put it under his blood and as soon as you put it in his blood this is what happens very can everybody see what's taking place here it gets put in the sea of his forgetfulness and nobody can tell you that you did anything else wrong because the lord justifies you who can tell me what justify means and it's not your dad justin what you can answer what is it you don't know anybody else what does justify mean brother so he says just as if you never did it remember brother tommy how crispy are your cucumbers you don't ever bring it up again because he never did it same thing here no matter what it was you just go before the lord forgive me lord and once again it's as if you never did it but the key to all this is you don't continue doing the same things wrong you don't go back just because you get mad again and kick the dog don't knock the world over and you don't continue cheating on tests just because you got away with it you don't continue saying little bad words you don't continue watching disney plus on saturday night you try to go forward and get better amen and so that's what the blood does it annihilates all the sin and the wrong and that's the message that we wanted to share with you and that my friend is why the rancher forgave you wow what a story can we hear one for our amazing scientists who brought that all out it's amazing absolutely phenomenal well it was very nice being with you all today we look forward to next time but for now i got to go whip his little behind at some chests so you wish buddy i don't know how to hunt legally but i can't beat you at chess legally i never have to wish nothing i know who i am god bless you [Applause] amen let's give another handclap of praise to the lord amen let's sing that song god is so good if you would all please stand amen how many can say that god is so good god is so good [Music] oh god is so good [Music] god is so good he's so good [Music] oh and god answers prayers oh god answers prayers oh god answers praise

on her way home yeah you know i had an experience the other day as you all know i've been going to school and i did an estimate to do some yard work for somebody weeks ago well i got the job i did the work he sold and they were just so impressed with the outcome established they ended up paying me the original price i asked in the first place and he also is somebody that can hire me when i get out of school i don't believe that's any kind of coincidence and the the funny thing is that his wife's name is dolores but his name is chris chris like how that there's pain but it's fixed through christ that's not a coincidence either i i just want to thank the lord for everything and uh god bless you guys don't live in liga is still doing great things for his children amen let's give another
