servant and and uh brings us uh the words of life amen we're gonna be hearing from our local ministry as well so be in prayer for each service we want you to come with anticipation uh that god will meet you and and just fill your cup amen praise the lord well if i could uh would just stand together for the reading of the word turn with me if you would to first john chapter four we want to speak on love today love is very important um brother branham said nothing but perfect love can enter into that place and he said whatever you do lay everything aside until you get perfect love that's how important it is he said get to the place where you can love everyone even your enemies so love is is very important before we begin reading let's look to the author this book heavenly father we thank you for the privilege that we have today to be in your house to worship you lord to express such love that you placed inside of us back to you oh god we love you today because you first loved us and lord we thank you for your great love and today lord as we enter into this part of the service lord we ask that you would come in a mighty way today come in the power of revelation and help us to see the depths of your love today lord we want to know you in a greater measure lord only you can do this lord to take our carnality our our flesh the scales off our eyes the wax out of our ears and god fill us so full of the holy ghost today lord we commit this service and ask that you would meet every need that be among us there's unspoken requests things on our hearts and lord the word of god today is a discerner of the thoughts and intents of our heart we pray that thy word would come and minister to each and every one of us be with those that are live streaming in their homes wherever they might be we ask god that you would minister revelation to each of them we thank you for these things now we commit the service and lord that you fulfill your purpose all in the precious name of jesus christ amen amen first john chapter 4 verse number 7 reads beloved let us love one another for love is of god and everyone that loveth is born of god and knoweth god and he that loveth not knoweth not god for god is love not just an attribute of god but actually divide love is god amen and then one more scripture beast uh saint john chapter 3 verse 16 perhaps the most read scripture in the bible for god so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son that whosoever believeth in him should not perish but have everlasting life amen for god sent not his son into the world to condemn the world but that the world through him might be saved and he that believeth on him is not condemned but he that believeth not is condemned already because he have not believed in the name of the only begotten son and this is the condemnation that light has come into the world and men choose to love darkness rather than light because their deeds were evil god bless you may be seated may god add his blessings all abundantly to this service amen before i forget in case i i missed this i was given this announcement that all checks that would be written this month and put into the offerings for for ties and offerings will not be deposited until next month because you know we're going to be gone so i just want that you all to know that in case your checks don't clear that's our excuse this time [Laughter] amen homie's happy to be a christian amen amen amen well when we think about love we we think about wonderful things do we not things perhaps like romance or someone being nice or sacrificing for us or or forgiving us of something that we've done wrong and we say that was love but there are things that we may not think so much about about love and and one of them is the strength of love its ability to withstand opposition i want to entitle this message love hurts love hurts love will get hurt and love will hurt you it's a little playing words but we want to take a look at the the strength of love and the motive of love this morning amen the love of of god is it's very hard to define can you say amen to that it's often misunderstood it's a mis represented and misinterpreted um we know that god's love is is unconditional but yet one day it will only be conditional it's available for everyone but only if you embrace it the bible tells us that nothing can separate us from the love of god yet many become separated from it love has no respect to persons yet one day it will respect only those that love god amen it's incomprehendable yet we are biblically instructed to be rooted and grounded in it so we got to know it right ephesians chapter 3 verse 18 says that we may be able to comprehend with all saints what is the breath length death and height and to know the love of christ which passeth knowledge that we might be filled with the fullness of god amen so knowing the love of god is it's mightily important it's imperative we must and not just on the surface but if i was to ask you to come in here sometime that i was gone and i probably did this with brother stan when i was away and i said can you please measure the width the length of the room and the height and the bible is telling us to know the love of god in these boundaries in one sense the love of god is boundless yet in another sense it has boundaries too often we look at god in part in god's love and part we might say there's a lot more to the love of god than what meets the eye or what comes into the mind of a man god who we know we read this morning is love it is patience his kind is long-suffering yet he's also identified this god of love is also identified as a consuming fire amen amen and it's a fearful thing to fall in the hands of a living god if if god says take your shoes off you better take your shoes off and god wasn't waiting around in front of moses being patient and long suffering he expected those shoes to come off god was not ashamed to go to calvary for you and me in fact the bible says he's not ashamed to call us brethren yet one day he will be ashamed of many in fact he said if you're ashamed of him on earth that he'll be ashamed of us in heaven for god so loved that he gave love has a purpose love will finish its objective it has a motive it has a purpose to fulfill and it will complete it love doesn't sit around like a a bump on a log or a picture on a wall waiting to be admired too many christians really don't know the love of god the depth of the love of god they don't dive into the depths they don't want to jump off into the deep end they don't know the depths of god's love nor do they want to actually know the responsibilities of love because there's a responsibility to love they want to run away from it they want to leave it for somebody else brother branham said in a man running from the presence of the lord he says how wishy-washy there's too many christians today are so soft soaped and everything until they think all they have to do is join a church or go somewhere and put their name on a book or a little something jump up and down and shout and something like that and they call it christianity christianity is an everyday rugged life living for god in this present world he said it's a constant burning of the fire and the love of god in the heart that sets you a fire and puts you out yonder with people making converts to christ and you know the next word he says responsibilities it's a responsibility love has responsibility love has a driving force behind it it's like an engine that powers through anything right it's really what makes it love it's its motive and its objective and its purpose love will reach to the lowest degree to save it jesus said i must needs go by samaria there was a need and love went to meet that need jesus made a convert out of her amen john chapter 4 verse 28 she left her water pots and went away into the city and saith to the man come see a man which told me all things that i ever that ever i've done is not this the christ love was projected amen amen sovereign grace took over brother branham said when when love is projected sovereign grace will take over it will go out and achieve the very purpose that love was projected for amen amen showing us that love has a purpose of course filial love i'm sorry yes filial love has a carnal purpose has a selfish purpose what i can get out of it if i do this if i do that then maybe you know i'll get something out of it but that is not divine love it's not the love of god amen one time the spirit led jesus to pass through jericho and i'll tell you what that was it was the love of god in jesus there was an unconverted man there his name was zacchaeus and he was a man that didn't have a good report he was rich but not all the riches came from fairly working and fairly trading he kind of took advantage of people took their money when he shouldn't have can you say man i mean knows the story amen the bible says that he was actually the chief among the publicans not a chief but the chief there was something more inside zacchaeus than curiosity when he wanted to see jesus i believe he was a predestinated seed but he was like a he climbed up into a sycamore tree to have a look at jesus when he went by and jesus being led by the spirit with a purpose when he walked he stopped when he got underneath that tree he looked up and said zacchaeus make haste and come down for today i must abide at the house wow oh my that's god working on both ends zacchaeus made hayes came down and received him joyfully the bible says love without respect of persons was being projected right amen but when all the people saw the bible says that they all murmured that jesus was going to be a guest with a man that was a sinner how many times have we judged somebody but something was happening in zachus's heart it was the goodness of god that was leading him to repentance amen that's what was happening the people didn't see it the purpose of love projected watch sovereign grace take over amen in that awesome presence of jehovah the prince of peace if i could say it like that in zacchaeus heart was being mended back to god because he was with them at the beginning we all were we were in god's thoughts before the foundation of the world he stood there and said unto jesus behold lord the half of my goods i give to the poor and if i have taken anything from any man by false occasion i restore him fourfold that was the goodness of god love was projected and you know what sovereign grace took over and love was responding i love him zacchaeus could say i love him because he first loved me and jesus said unto him this day is salvation come into this house for as much as he also is the son of abraham for the son of man has come to seek and to save that which was lost love was being projected amen love has a purpose there's a motive behind it for god so loved the world that he came in the form of the son of man to seek out and save that which was lost love was at work amen love has to go to work calvary had to take place love doesn't just sit around and fellowship right it's true no sir it has a more important agenda than that today i say is still seeking out that which was lost amen love isn't always easy turn with me if you would isaiah 53 the bible says who have believed our report and to whom is the arm of the lord revealed what a powerful question today brother ryan said the most important thing we could pray for is revelation now who have believed our report and to whom is the arm of the lord revealed boy there are so many depths of of belief and and revelation i think we just i'll tell you when god gives us a revelation it should just make us so humble so grateful so thankful but when the devil tells you a little truth it'll just puff you up brother brandon said in the message god hiding himself in simplicity then revealing himself in the same in 63 he said let me read it again closely he said who had believed our report and to whom is the arm of the lord revealed he said in other words if you have believed our report then the arm of the lord has been revealed why do you think the angel of the lord said to brother branham only believe i like that song only believe it's got to start with you standing up and i say i believe that word i believe what's being spoken and the god of revelation will come and he will reveal the whole thing to you amen god wants you to step out draw an eye to him and he'll draw an eye to you in the message the sixth seal brother brennaman said who have believed are reported to whom is the arm of the lord been revealed see he said believe the report then the arm of the lord is revealed the arm the word of god is revealed right now oh i love that the arm of the lord is the word first uh saint john chapter 1 verse 1 in the beginning was the word the word was the word and the word was god and the i'm sorry the word was with god and the word was god i want to read it just like it is in the beginning was the word in verse 14 says the word was made flesh and dwelt among us and we beheld the glory of the word the glory as of the only begotten of the father full of grace and truth jesus said in matthew 16 verse 17 he said flesh and blood have not revealed it unto thee but my father which is in heaven and upon this rock i'll build my church and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it amen you know i we should never be concerned about all the churches that are out there in the world honestly the whole church the whole world could be full of churches but the only church that god is truly interested in is the church that he is building and he builds his church by revelation amen in other words no man can lay a stone to it the bible does say the the the foundation was laid by the apostles and the prophets but it wasn't their word they were just speaking the word of god god holds and it holds back the revelation to whom he wants to give it to and he hides it from the wise and the prudent to think that they got it sold up in a bag but you know what he does he reveals it to babes babes those that that praise is perfected in that little group who's who's always needy who always recognizes their heavenly father is the one that supplies all their needs amen that's right god never meant for us to walk around acting like we got it all figured out and we got it all sold up and i got this walk all taken care of and that god is so much with me no he wants you to testify that though i'm weak he is strong he meets my knees i look to the hills for what cometh my hell my help cometh from the lord too often we get things uh messed up this rock that jesus talked upon this rock i will build my church that's the church i want to be in i want to be in that church that rock was not peter that rock was not jesus is the christ the son of the living god no sir the devils believe that they said have you come to tormundus you're the son of god have you come to torment us before well that's not where jesus was building his church now that rock is christ being revealed to you personally and you standing on it those demons weren't standing on it the knowledge is not the rock it's when god reveals it to you and you say yes lord it is mine i'm standing with you i'll tell you that has everything to do with your attitude may the lord bless us with understanding revelation today our dependency needs to be on christ not our intellect we need to pray for revelation we can't muster it up we we can't force it we can't make god do it all you can do is get as humble as you can as lord you can submit to the word he gives grace to the humble more grace to the humble but he resists the pride and i'll tell you let me just say this about pride every one of us in here deals with pride amen every one of us the problem is we don't look at the pride that we have we're always looking at somebody else's pride who's greater who's worse who's acting wrong and we're missing the pride that's keeping us from the revelation that god wants to give us let's look a little deeper into the boundaries of god's love here verse 2 of isaiah 53 for he shall grow up before him as a tender plan is the root out of the dry ground he have no form nor coming us and we we shall see him there's no beauty that we should desire him he didn't this love didn't look great from the outside like when we look at one another we say oh he's cute or she's pretty or he's a real man or she's a real woman but when you looked at jesus he didn't have any of that but look he's the man he was the man and he is the man and he will be the man amen he was you talk about now this is for god so loved the world that he gave right here he was despised and rejected of men a man of sorrows acquainted with greece and we all hid our faces from him we were ashamed he was despised and we esteemed him not i'll tell you love hurts surely he had borne our griefs and carried ourselves yet we did esteem him stricken smitten of god and afflicted kind of like job's friends job you must have done something wrong mm-hmm what they say to jesus hanging there on the cross well if god's with you why don't you just you know do something save save yourself save us just mocking not having any understanding on the love of god you know sometimes people don't know why you're laying down your life for them they think they're just taking advantage of you they don't know but you know what jesus said you don't take my life i lay it down and when you got a revelation of the love of god and you lay your heart down you know what you're doing you know what you're doing he was wounded for our transgressions he was bruised for our iniquities the chastisement of our peace was upon him and with his stripes we are healed love hurt for us love hurt for us if that doesn't make you feel indebted that you just want to yield your life and say thank you jesus praise you lord i love you more today remind me why do you think those nail prints are still going to be in his hands when we get on the other side he hurt for us that's where love is manifested when love gets hurt all we like sheep have gone astray we have turned everyone to his own ways the lord have laid upon him the iniquity of us all wow he was oppressed he was afflicted yet he opened not his mouth he was brought as the lamb to the slaughter and there's a sheep before the shears is dumb he so he opened not his mouth he could have said to any one of us called out our iniquity and our sin any day of the week but he opened not his mouth love was hurting for you and i am amen he was taken from the prisons in the judgment who shall declare his generation will you for he was cut off out of the land of the living for the transgressions of my people was he stritten he was made he made his grave with the wicked and and with the rich in his death because he had done no violence neither was any deceit in his mouth oh i love that what a challenge for you and i what a challenge for you and i yet it pleased the lord to bruise him to make him hurt and suffer and if he had put him to grief when thou shall make his soul an offering for you and me his soul became an offering for you and me he shall see his seed he shall prolong his days and the pleasure of the lord shall prosper in his hand i'll tell you if it wasn't for the perfect lamb of god none of us would be here today and i'll tell you even being stuck in a church without god in it because if you read the book of revelations in this age speaking to the church as a whole they kicked jesus out a long time ago yes they're still having church but it's man having church it's a group of people it's it's entertainment it's it's fun it's it's delightful it's it's it's it's coffee and donuts and and you name it but i'll tell you give me that old-time religion give it to me the way that it was given to us by the apostles love isn't always easy if i could say it like this love still hurts god hurt for you and i he bore griefs he carried our sorrows just like you would for your children you bear the grief you you help them he was wounded for our transgression bruised for iniquities he was chastised for our peace and he was whipped for our healing so when you're desiring healing for your body i want you just to close your eyes and picture the stripes that he bore for what you're asking for he paid the price there's no other man that stood there and got whipped for you but when you can realize what god has done for you your face you better rise to the place to receive your healing he hurt for us god suffered blood and died tell me that love is not going to suffer it will suffer to bring a restoration we're taking a look not at just a history of god's love but we're trying to bring it home today love went to work at calvary he said at calvary it is finished calvary paid the price for our sin the work of paying the debt of sin was purchased and paid for at calvary but the responsibility of love is still moving forward it's still suffering it's still hurting it's still moving forward paul said it like this all that i might know him in the power of his resurrection and in the fellowship of his sufferings it's still suffering today even after calvary god has still had to turn his head away from us when there's things that we've done that we shouldn't have done things we've said we shouldn't have said things we looked at that we shouldn't have looked at things that we thought that we shouldn't have been thinking god has still had to turn his head it brings a pain to god when we don't care enough to keep our vessel under subjection love still hurts friends we still move god one way or the other we move god amen how many times has god been long suffering towards us many how often has he waited patiently for us how lazy we've been how unconcerned and uncaring at times and you think god hasn't hurt because of us love still hurts brother and sister but i'll say it like this love has the love of god is so strong that it has a purpose that it will withstand endure all things because it has its subject in mind its purpose in mind the song goes how measureless and strong it shall forevermore enter the saints and angels song when love is projected sovereign grace will take over and meet what love has projected for patiently projected projected endured law endured for it's all because love has a purpose to seek and save that which is lost now it isn't just about oh yeah i repented and i got baptized and i'm saved i hope i'm not misunderstood but i probably will be because love is misunderstood but i'm so against that every day is the day of salvation and a day is not going to go by where god is not going to speak to you and call you up higher because love is always growing and we've been predestined to come into his image and we need to be interested in the image the full image of christ we haven't been predestined to be saved alone we need to have a full understanding of what we're being called to and that's why the word of god should move us it should prick our hearts it should cause us to come higher with god i'll say like this love cannot rest until it has seen its last predestinated seed saved and i'll tell you those that are going in the rapture love will not rest until they're ready until they're ready because she has to make herself ready we're not going in the rapture because my name is john martin because we're in the message because we belong to a church because fill in the blank it's when you become a manifested adopted son and daughter of god that that god has put you through the test and you now are living the life that god has ordained you to live amen and i'll say it like this i say it with the fear of god don't don't think that you're there you don't want to take my word for it now i'm okay with that i don't ever want you to take my word i'm not bringing my word by the way and i know you'll take paul's word paul said i'll press towards that mark here is a man that we have so much confidence that we read his word 14 books we have confidence in it but you know his attitude was never i've attained been there you got a little ways to go before you catch up to me i've apprehended i got it right here no no he wasn't like that he was a man that was still pressing god do you wanna know why he wanted to know god so bad brother mark he wanted to know god so bad that god was revealing himself daily to him the revelations were so great and every time god was showing oh i want to be like that i want to manifest that he gave his life to god and god took that life and he used him as a as a potter had the clay in his hands and molded him into a vessel that he could bring the gospel to many people and save many people amen amen love is still working it's still hurting how many can testify that it can be very difficult for us when we're dealing with people all the hardships we go through all the rejections and the persecutions all the backbiting murmuring we're trying to help them complain love hurts today i'll say this love is not one-sided yes love is unconditional but it always has a purpose just because love possesses the power to love its enemies it doesn't love for kicks it doesn't love for show-off we can't stop others from using us and i'll say it like this nor do we want to that's not scriptural what scripture was pray for those that use you that's scripture because how are they going to see the love of god if you don't take the abuse remember brother brian says it's not the action towards you it's how you react by this example perfect love shall all men know you're my disciple not by how god used you not by what god's done in your life not by saying what you've attained oh my my brothers and sisters for us trying to impress one another while we're talking with one another i'm telling you it's time to grow up it's time to to prove in our test in our trials that the love of god is with us amen that we can still produce a life of christ behind closed doors amen but there's another side to love and that is love has a purpose to turn others to the truth a greater truth more truth till it gets to the place that when he the spirit of truth to come he will lead and guide you to what all truth don't be satisfied with part of god get a heart for all the truth because that's where god's heart is at get into the bible and read it get into the message and listen to it talk about it fellowship you want to be fellowship and fellowship around the word of god it will not stop laboring god the holy ghost will not stop laboring for us until he sees all the truth inside of us so why should we the bible says that paul endured a lot of hurt for god's elected bride paul didn't have some daddy old uh uh understanding about god's love that it just a false you know the bible says that we need to study to rightly divide the word of truth a lot of times we don't have a good understanding we the whole the bible brother brahm did say in the message he said the evidence of the holy ghost is having a correct understanding of the word of god and i believe that's what the holy ghost does it will lead you to know the word of god the way it was meant to but he didn't think that uh that all the elect of god are going to make it in just fine that you don't have to do nothing they're elected they're predestinated and everything's just going to be just fine just because they're elected no we have to endure things for the elect's sake you want scripture let's read it ii timothy chapter 2 verse 1 not belittling any scripture what i'm belittling is our attitude that we don't want to work like we need to work second timothy 2 1 thou therefore my son be strong in the grace that is in christ jesus and the things that thou has heard of me among many witnesses the same thou commit uh to faithful men who should be able to teach others i wonder today how many here wants to be one of these men amen how many wants to be a faithful witness for jesus christ okay we're getting instructions from paul pretend you're timothy and paul is telling you that you need to the things that that you've heard you've learned from them you've been a witness of now you to take this same word and and teach it to others who will teach it to others that's a responsibility right there i'd rather have somebody try to tell me how to how to help myself get closer to god that when they see something wrong that they'll actually come over and help me get me on the right track now therefore what's the first thing thou therefore endure hardness love has to be strong as a good soldier jesus christ no man warth entangleth himself with the affairs of this life that he may please him have chosen us to be a soldier so we need to step away from the world the things of the world you can't do both don't get entangled and if a man also strive for the masteries yet he's not crowned except he strive lawfully you gotta you gotta do the right thing the husbandman that laboreth must be first partakers of the fruits consider what i say in the lord give the understanding in all things how many wants this understanding how many wants to do how many is willing to be a partaker of the fruit not easy remember that jesus christ of the seed of david was raised from the dead according to my gospel wherein this gospel that we're talking about i suffer trouble as an evil dealer can you believe it i'm suffering trouble as an evil doer even when i'm in prison but the word of god is not bound in other words the word of god is just as much alive in your home in your car in your prison situation as anywhere because the word of god is not bound therefore i endure all things see love has a vision it has a purpose it will lay down its life for the elect it has a job to do it has to endure a whole lot that they may also obtain the salvation which is in christ jesus with eternal glory it is a faithful saying for if we be dead with him we shall also live with him if we suffer we shall also reign with him wait a minute the way that i was taught that jesus suffered for me at calvary and now i don't have to suffer see how important it is to have the right understanding of the gospel because if we suffer we shall also reign with him but if we deny him how do we deny him we're unwilling to suffer unwilling to take the responsibilities he will also deny us it's awful quiet i wonder if somebody is feeling the holy ghost this morning amen i'm feeling it not that we go by feelings but you know i'll say it like we ought to have a hallelujah meeting i know if your favorite team was playing right now and they just scored you'd be you know you'd be a little louder turn with me to second corinthians chapter 11 the love of god now we got so much more to go i'm just going to try to go through this quickly the love of god through paul suffered many things for the elect's sake and the reason i'm bringing this is because he's he told timothy and timothy was supposed to teach others right and then others taught others and others taught others and others taught others and and others taught brother johnson and brother johnson taught me and we're still teaching amen amen verse 23 says are they ministers of christ speaking of others other churches and things he said i am more are they ministers i am more well that's pretty bold to say i don't really think it was the carnality man that was speaking he's bringing a point and he he showed how he's more of a minister not that he had more powerful messages he doesn't say anything in here about his powerful uh preaching in fact one place he said i didn't come to you with enticing words of man's wisdom no he's talking about the fruit that transpires through suffering he said in labor's more abundant in stripes above measure in prisons more frequent in debts often of the jews five times received i 40 stripes i thought only jesus had to bear the stripes must jesus bear the cross alone and the whole world go free there's got to be someone who had counted in a privilege to suffer for a soul that's what was happening here love was being projected through paul thrice that was beat with rods once i was stoned suffered shipwreck in journeyings often in perils look at all the perils he even had pearls among false brethren in weariness and painfulness and watchings often hunger and thirst and fastings in the cold and naked it but those things which are beside those things which are without those things that are happening in the world around me as i'm going out and trying to bring the gospel that which cometh upon me daily the care of all the churches who is weak am i not weak who is offended i burn not if i must needs glory i will glory of the things which concern my infirmities you know here's most people complain about their problems but paul was glorying because that his problems were a direct result because love was being projected through him see love hurts it hurts today but it didn't bother paul think about that have you ever realized how many times paul had to exercise forgiveness long suffering and love the love was so strong that it can endure all things for the elect's sake i'm so thankful for paul so grateful for paul second corinthians chapter 12 verse 9 just one chapter over and he said unto me my grace is sufficient for thee for my strength is made perfect in weakness most gladly will i rather glory not my puffed upness what i think i'm great but in my infirmities that the power of christ may rest upon me because as soon as you bloat your goat christ is gone he takes his flight he goes sits up there and he waits till the right spirit gets on you he's not going to share his glory with the devil i'll say the key to becoming strong in christ is not to become a weak christian amen not becoming a weak believer no sir the key to spiritual strength is to become weak in how you look at yourself amen it's your dependency on christ he said therefore i take pleasure and infirmities i take pleasure and reproaches and necessities and persecutions and distresses for what there's a purpose for christ's sake for when i'm weak then i am strong in other words christ is able to use this body if i'm not trying to do what i want to do you know we all have agendas right it's true we all have agendas every one of us going to one another's house to visit has an agenda it may be just for food but you got an agenda paul had an agenda the love of god has an agenda the love of god in paul had a purpose to fulfill and nothing nothing was going to stand in his way first corinthians 9 19 look at the attitude and the anybody can have this attitude right here for though i be free from all men god set me free he died for me at calvary i'm free for thou i be free from all men yet have i made myself a servant unto all what's the purpose brother john why would you do something crazy like that that i might gain the more no one else can make you a true servant coming to church don't make you a true servant hearing the true word of god don't make you a true servant giving money don't make you a true servant but when you make a decision in your heart that at all costs i want to be a true servant and you mean it and every time the devil comes and he offers you an easier way a way that you don't have to be a servant and still be a christian you resist that spirit you rebuke that spirit you make a choice and then you keep making that choice every day you get up every day you deny yourself you deny yourself you deny your will you pick up your cross and you follow jesus and that is a true servant of god you have to crucify that nature that wants to be served and make yourself a servant unto all i love paul's motive do you know love always has the right motive love always has the right mode and i'm speaking of divine love amen i'm not agape divine love always has the right motive it's that uh that love that comes in and tricks you that mixed mode of love that filial love that wants you to mix your motive in and try to get something when you're doing something for god stay away from it come on it's time he that have this hope amen that we're going to be like christ one day he that had this whole he purifies himself even as he's pure so we got a job to do amen look at verse 22 i just love this mode of here he said in verse 22 i am made all things to all men that i might by all means save some it's like the same purpose jesus christ had he came to seek and save that which was lost in the message the mighty conqueror brother branham said and the strongest force that i know of he said is love though i speak with the tongues of men and angels and have not love i am nothing or become as a sounding brass and tinkling symbols though i have the power to move mountains and have not love i am nothing he quotes that's what each individual of the church ought to purpose in their heart to purpose in their hearts amen to do their very best for the kingdom of god and how do you serve god question when you're serving one another when you're taking care of the little end of the horn as it was to say and men who has ever ever amounted to very much in the world has been men who's come down and become not great men they made themselves small in order to accomplish a purpose a purpose see divine love of god has an eternal purpose always in its mind if we're just operating with fetal love then our motives are going to be mixed we're trying to get some personal gain while working for god you can smell it a mile away coming i wish there was a a lot of hallelujahs you know you can't fool god amen you can't fool the holy ghost in the message do you now believe brother branham said the mightiest force there is on earth is love that's exactly there's nothing that will break down love no matter what it is the love is the strongest force nothing can break it down think about that you get so in love with god that nothing shakes you nothing moves you nothing takes you away from being faithful to the house of god nothing takes you away from digging into the message of the hour nothing takes you away from the word of god man shall not live by bread alone but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth and what is it it is the love of god if you love me keep my commandments in the message the statue of a perfect man brother man says so when you surrender your complete being then the holy spirit just pours through you in these virtues then you're a living tabernacle then the people look out and they say that's a man full of virtue knowledge he believes the word temperance patience godliness brotherly kindness full of the love of the holy ghost see there he is he's walking around not the pulpit he's walking around you and i ought to be seeing one another walking in these virtues now it's kind of hard to show you long-suffering if we're just shaking hands and saying i love you i love you god bless you we're good we're good we're one yes it's really hard to see the fruit of the spirit there you see the fruit of the spirit when you're down in the dumps when you've been rejected when you've been slapped at and kicked at and used and abused and they still asked you to do something for him that's when the love of god swells up in your heart and it manifests to the world that you're one of them is that your desire amen he said what is it he said a statue that unbelievers can look at and say there's a christian there's a a man or a woman who knows what they're talking about you never seen a kinder sweeter godlier person he says you're sealed a seal shows on both sides a seal shows on both sides you don't even need to say i'm sealed why because it shows on the outside if you have to spend time proving something to somebody you may want to get back on your knees and know you don't got to prove anything to anybody a real seal shows on both sides whether you're going or coming you see the seal just the same there you are when a man or woman possesses this then the capstone amen perfect love comes down and seals them into the kingdom of god which is the holy ghost love hurts love gets hurt so it has to be strong enough to endure the pain that it's going to in order to reach this objective how many times have you tried to do something for somebody i'm going to do this thing i'm going to do this and you go to do it and they don't even seem to be thankful or they they they had this attitude like well you should have you owe me this i deserve this and if you yield to that thing you'll stop helping them you'll say shake the dust off my feet and walk away from them but you know you'll never meet your objective if you stop don't stop love doesn't stop it bears all things it endures all things it hopes all things it it'll it'll go to the end because because charity never fails it will reach its objective its objective is always to bring a person to a higher truth yes if they're unsafe they got to get saved if they're safe they got to get into a higher truth well it's not as important to who to you to you this is why we must always have a burden one for another to pray one for another to care about one another to see one another coming up higher in christ don't be satisfied with just dropping into a church and being and being in the message right that's complacency that's laodicea right here just because we came out of lao to see it doesn't mean that spirit ain't trying to creep into our lives how many wants more love all right romans 5 verse 5 says the love of god is shed abroad in our heart by the holy ghost which is given unto us you can't separate god in love and to want god's love without wanting god's holiness god's righteousness keeping his commandments pleasing the lord god is not one-sided this is a chance for us to get all of god amen the problem with believers who feel they have the holy ghost all the time is they're never pressing in for more i'm not taking away the holy ghost that we have but if that seems to be our badge all the time i got it i got it i got it we're not going to be looking for more will the holy ghost be looking for vainglory look at me in its conversation look at me no it won't it's not going to share its glory with any man will the holy ghost be looking to build some man's reputation no there needs to be more amens i'm telling you if i have to make every one of you come stand go across the early christ made himself of no refutation what do you think he's going to do and let yours become great don't do it galatians chapter 5 verse 22 but the fruit of the spirit now is love it's joy peace on suffering generals goodness faith meekness temperance against such there is no law now faith is great faith is great christ dwells in our heart by faith but you could have faith to remove mountains and have not love we're still nothing so we want to put it in its place amen the emphasis needs to be the love of god will take you through and still you will lay down your life to help somebody keep the focus on the objective of love and the bible says verse 24 and they that are christ what have they done they that belong to the holy ghost they've submitted they have crucified the flesh with the affections and the lust now this is not a one-shot deal because jesus told us we had to do it daily amen if we live in the spirit let us also walk in the spirit and let us not what have a desire of getting attention of and because it's just called vainglory there's not even desire to provoke one another that i'm i'm better than you i know more than you or envying one another i wish i was get away from that the only desire you should have is to be like christ paul did not like it when you when if we if men followed him he had strict restrictions on that he said you only follow me as i follow christ if i decide to preach any other gospel than what i preach let me be a curse don't even listen to me don't follow me no more love will get hurt and love will hurt you jesus said in revelations 3 verse 19 as many as i love i rebuke and chase and hummy's ever been rebuked before homie's not participating in this i'll tell you a lot of times a rebuke hurts when you get chastised it hurts let me ask these kids have you ever been spanked before did you jump up and down and say yeah no because it hurts it hurts but daddy and mama wants you to be better god wants us to be better and so the answer to that is just simply repent and to be zealous about it to be excited about it lord i want to get back on the right track don't sit there and try to defend your reputation god is calling us to his image now time is running so i'm just going to give you scriptures to read when you get time because there's lots hebrews chapter 12 verse 1 through 15. what a wonderful chapter god does not want us to despise his chastening because every everyone gets it amen amen and then ephesians chapter 6 verses 10 through 18 god wants us to be strong in the lord and to put on the whole armor of god love gets hurt and we have to be strong love hurts when we have to forsake our family our friends our brothers our sisters our mother and our father because that's what jesus said if we don't put god first i remember my i had kicked out some things out of my house when i was younger and my dad came to visit me and he said i don't understand why you're taking away that tv from your kids you got to have a tv when you were raised i couldn't deny it but nobody taught me any better so i had one of those things in my bedroom i got to enjoy whatever i wanted but when i came to the truth i realized it wasn't the most edifying thing for my children love hurts and the devil's still going to come and try to get you to compromise that's why i shared that story you're gonna have to make a decision i love god more than i love fill in the blank it hurts to give up the world the things of the world it does there's pleasure in sin come on now love hurts when you're persecuted you're forsaken or you're lied to or used especially to those that you love and you respect love hurts but the neat thing about love is it's long suffering it'll go through that it keeps its eyes on the end result don't be wishy-washy don't let feelings and emotions and drama come in your life stay focused god's taking me through i'm gonna be in his damage i'm not gonna let anything stand in my way all right read first corinthians 13 chapter or chapter 13 verses 1 through 13. the love chapter that's such a beautiful because god is calling us to maturity amen not to love carnally anymore but to love as a son and daughter of god i just want to read two more sets of scriptures is that okay you be patient with me you're not going to see me for a while after this responsibility is on the other person that's up here john chapter 13 verse 33 little children yet a little while i'm with you you shall seek me as i said unto the jews whether i go you cannot come so now i say to you a new commandment i give unto you that you love one another as i have loved you don't try to love one another with your interpretation it has limits go the limitless way how many likes uh having a cell phone with luminous minutes right tax all you want talk all you want who wants to pay a hundred dollars for just 10 minutes of talking right god don't want just us to be limited he wants us to be limited less limitless in love you know i'm so thankful that you know what i'm saying even if i don't have the ability to say it right a new commandment i give you that you love one another as i have loved you that ye love one another do not love one another the way they're loving you step it up look for them to cross you look for them to say something negative to turn the oh i don't want to talk down i don't want to shine for jesus by this shall all men know that you're my disciples if you have love one for another remember jesus he was the one that should have got his feet washed but he was washing everybody else's romans chapter 8 verse 35 just going to read end with this chapter here romans 8 verse 35 who shall separate us from the love of christ shall tribulation i don't think so distress persecution famine nakedness peril or sword money my job my husband my wife my kids my neighbor some brother church some sister at church love hurts but it shall forevermore endure as it is written for thy sake for our sake we're killed all the day long we are counted as sheep for the slaughter it's okay we know what's coming but we're going to be strong in the lord and the power of his night nay and all these things were more than conquerors through him that loved us for i am persuaded that neither death nor alive nor angels or principality nor powers nor things present nor things that come nor height nor death nor any other creature shall be able to separate us oh i love that from the love of god which is in christ jesus our lord god bless you let's stand together love will get hurt and the love of god inside of you will end up hurting someone not purposely but you're trying to help that person and you may say something that they just feel i i don't want that i think of a number of times that people have spoken to me but it wasn't them it was god i think it was just this service right out here i was staying there and brother johnson was talking to someone as brother johnson was talking to someone god was speaking to me through brother johnson god knows what he's doing we want to take our lives place them in the hands of god and say god fill me with the love that will go all the way with you amen amen let's bow our hearts in a word of prayer do you want that love amen amen let's just agree for it right now father we thank you for your precious word today lord we thank you for hurting so much for us wasn't just at calvary hurt for us but lord you manifest your love all the time you you show us mercies every day freely faithful is our god lord we thank you for all the times that you've forgiven us all the times you've been long-suffering patient all the times you've given us peace and we haven't deserved it all the times you've come into our homes and and you've just stilled the troubled waters all the times that we feared and wondered where you're at and know that you're a present help in a time of need you come in at the last minute so many times lord to show your faithfulness to us lord you've you've never quit on us but you wanted us to know you said i know the thoughts i think towards you saith the lord thoughts of peace and not of evil to give us an expected end you're gonna see us through oh god we thank you for the great love that you have for us and as we come to the close of the service lord [Music] you've dealt with our hearts you've called us to step in to the deep waters of your love as it were to know your love in a greater measure not through a knowledge or the quotes that the prophet has spoken lord but you've asked us to to get to the place that we manifest that deep love oh god bless us in our times at home that we spend with you in prayer and your word and the message and father when so be it that these times would arise god may you use us as vessels like you did paul among whoever it might be to be willing to endure all things for the elect's sake knowing that the people that that are about us or the people that have done things to us lord give us the faith to believe that you're they're your elect as well grant it lord grant it lord jesus hear our prayers lord all that you have spoken to the hearts of your people individually now i pray that they would just respond back to you with so be it lord in their lives we thank you for these things lord we're believing that one day lord we're going to be in your likeness and all men will know by that life that we're living we pray these things in jesus precious name amen let's sing that i love him [Music] him because they first love me and purchased my salvation [Applause] [Music] on
