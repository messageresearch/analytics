[12:03] and feel no alarm.
[12:08] Though tempest may blow and the storm
[12:11] clouds arise, obscuring the brightness
[12:15] of life,

[17:11] For that. And also for me, I'm going to
[17:14] see a n knee uh doctor tomorrow to see
[17:18] if I can figure out what's going on with
[17:20] my limbs. Um all these bodies will pass
[17:24] away,
[17:25] right? So, as many doctors as we can
[17:29] see, and
[17:32] we're still subject to the to the flesh.
[17:35] Amen. But we have a heavenly father that
[17:38] loves us and we're looking forward to

[17:42] faith, let's remember all the
[17:43] missionaries. Amen.

[18:24] on one accord.
[18:26] Dear heavenly father, Lord, as we come
[18:27] before you tonight, this morning, Lord
[18:29] God, we pray, Lord, that our hearts are
[18:33] tender, Lord,
[18:35] that through that Lord, we have good
[18:38] ground. And as that word would come,
[18:40] Lord, that it would just take hold,
[18:42] Lord. It would not be a fleeting word,
[18:45] Lord, or just be robbed up by some some
[18:50] uh crows, Lord, that would pick it away,
[18:52] Lord, as we leave, but it would just
[18:54] stay with us, Lord, through the week,
[18:56] Lord, and that we could just grow closer
[18:59] and closer to you, Lord. We pray that
[19:02] your spirit Lord would just work upon
[19:04] each and every one of us. Whatever need
[19:06] there would be here Lord this morning
[19:08] Lord we know that you are more than
[19:10] capable of meeting each one of those
[19:12] needs. Lord Lord we just have to have
[19:14] faith and to believe that Lord you are
[19:17] capable of doing what you said you would
[19:20] do Lord God. And this morning, Lord, as
[19:22] we come to you, Lord, on one accord this

[20:28] Amen.
[20:36] I thirsted for the barren lands of sin
[20:41] and shame and nothing satisfies me there
[20:46] I found.
[20:49] But to the blessed cross of Christ one
[20:52] day I came when living waters tended
[20:57] there abound.

[22:15] Calary?
[22:17] A fountain there is flowing deep in
[22:21] wine.
[22:23] The Savior now invites you to the water
[22:28] free where thirsting spirits can be
[22:32] satisfied. Amen.
[22:35] Oh, drinking at the springs of living
[22:38] water.

[23:05] &gt;&gt; When the battle's over. Amen.
[23:16] I am a soldier of the cross, a foul of
[23:24] the lamb.
[23:27] And share I fear to own his cause or
[23:33] blush to speak his name.
[23:38] And when the battle's over, we shall
[23:42] wear a crown. Yes, we shall wear a
[23:45] crown. Yes, we shall wear a crown. And

[25:25] Are there no foes for me to face? Must I
[25:31] not stem the flood?

[27:26] Hallelujah. That's a promise.
[27:29] &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's stand as we get ready to
[27:31] change order of service and let's just
[27:33] sing open our eyes. Amen.
[27:39] Open
[27:40] our eyes,
[27:43] Lord.
[27:46] We want to see Jesus
[27:54] to reach out and touch
[27:59] him
[28:02] to say that we love
[28:06] him.
[28:10] Open our ears,
[28:14] Lord.
[28:17] and help us to listen.
[28:25] Open our eyes,
[28:28] Lord.
[28:31] We want to see Jesus.
[28:39] Open our eyes,
[28:43] Lord.
[28:46] We want to see Jesus
[28:53] to reach out and touch
[28:58] him
[29:00] to say that we love
[29:05] him.
[29:09] Open our ears,
[29:12] Lord,
[29:15] and help us to listen.
[29:19] [Music]
[29:40] Heat.
[29:42] Heat.
[29:52] Heat. Heat. Heat.
[30:02] Heat.
[30:03] [Music]
[30:14] Heat.
[30:28] [Music]
[30:36] Amen.
[30:38] &gt;&gt; Lord,
[30:41] &gt;&gt; unless he does,
[30:43] &gt;&gt; we can't see.
[30:44] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[30:46] &gt;&gt; He did say, "Blessed are your eyes."
[30:49] &gt;&gt; Blessed are your ears. So, we are
[30:52] blessed people.
[30:54] It's good to be in the house of the
[30:55] Lord.
[31:02] &gt;&gt; If I knew she was going to be here, I
[31:04] would have preached a different message.
[31:20] I knew you were preach.
[31:25] I knew you'd be here. This message is
[31:26] for you.
[31:32] &gt;&gt; God's word is for all of us.
[31:38] We can receive from him exactly what he
[31:42] has for us through his word. I've
[31:44] experienced so many times hearing
[31:46] something
[31:48] that didn't have anything to do with
[31:50] what God was speaking to.
[31:52] &gt;&gt; But he used the scripture, used what was
[31:54] spoken, but he spoke to me about
[31:56] something different.
[31:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[31:59] &gt;&gt; And he just he used that to bring forth
[32:02] the revelation. And we serve a God
[32:05] that's supernatural.
[32:08] &gt;&gt; His ways are beyond our ways.
[32:09] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[32:13] We could sit down with our children and
[32:14] try to talk to them and reason with
[32:16] them. They know the language and
[32:20] A and B and C and one and two and three.
[32:22] And but when God speaks to us, it's
[32:24] like, well, where did that come from?
[32:26] &gt;&gt; But it makes perfect sense when he
[32:28] speaks to us. Amen.
[32:31] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. It's good to be in the
[32:32] house of God.
[32:35] So good to have Donna back. And I know
[32:37] it's going to be real hard, but um I
[32:39] just say um I and I say this really to
[32:42] everybody. Um no, no matter what you're
[32:44] going through and enter into the praise
[32:48] and worship of the word
[32:50] &gt;&gt; because in that is where our comfort
[32:52] comes
[32:53] &gt;&gt; and our strength is through the word. Of
[32:56] course, it's the enemy's job to get our
[32:58] focus on on the wrong things on on the
[33:01] things that hurt us, right? They hurt
[33:03] us. He wants to capitalize. Imagine if
[33:07] somebody um okay, somebody hits you on
[33:10] the side of the face with the first, you
[33:12] know, what are you doing? That's not
[33:13] right.
[33:15] And then you you get stung and it you
[33:17] know, you you know, I'm not going to
[33:19] shake your hand no more. I'm going to
[33:20] hit you back. Something's going to be
[33:22] going on in the natural realm like that.
[33:24] But in in God's realm, you get hit in
[33:27] the face, you turn the cheek,
[33:29] &gt;&gt; you look to the, you know, the good side
[33:30] of a situation.
[33:32] And um I believe the word has strength
[33:35] for us today.
[33:36] &gt;&gt; Amen. Turn with me if you would to the
[33:38] book of uh Ecclesiastes chapter 3 for a
[33:42] very familiar uh scripture.
[33:47] Amen. How many believes God's going to
[33:50] bless you today?
[33:52] &gt;&gt; Amen. It's through faith. It's through
[33:54] the faith in God all things are
[33:58] possible.
[34:01] Amen. Ecclesiastes
[34:03] chapter 3. Maybe before we begin reading
[34:07] there. We're just going to look to the
[34:09] Lord in prayer.
[34:12] Our dear heavenly father,
[34:15] we thank you that you've given us
[34:17] strength and health to be here today.
[34:21] And we thank you that you've placed a
[34:23] desire in our heart to want to be here.
[34:27] a love, a longing,
[34:31] &gt;&gt; a desire to be more like you and
[34:35] and to get ready for your soon coming.
[34:40] And Father, we invite your presence in
[34:43] this part of the service, Lord.
[34:46] Uh may we continue to worship you by
[34:49] worshiping your word. For we know that
[34:52] you are your word and we love you, Lord.
[34:55] We love your word.
[34:57] We pray Lord that your anointing would
[34:59] rest upon each each of us today Lord not
[35:03] only the the the hearer of the word but
[35:06] Lord the speaker unless you come and
[35:08] minister Lord there's no words that I
[35:11] could give that could be of any benefit
[35:13] to your bride. But only you can feed
[35:15] your bride. And so we're looking to you
[35:17] in the spirit Lord to minister to us.
[35:22] And Lord, we pray that you would
[35:24] accomplish the very purpose in which
[35:26] you've uh set aside this service today.
[35:29] Pray that you'd be with all those that
[35:30] are missing today. Lord, we ask that
[35:32] your Holy Spirit would supply every
[35:34] need. Bless our our sister Linda Helms.
[35:38] Lord, whatever condition, every
[35:40] situation, pray that you remember those
[35:42] that are battling cancer. Remember
[35:43] Brother Bill Bailey and Sister Elizabeth
[35:46] Murphy. Lord, we just ask that you
[35:48] remember all those that need you, Lord.
[35:51] for your God that is is able Lord to to
[35:54] meet and exceed all the needs that we
[35:57] could possibly have. We thank you ask
[36:00] your blessings now on this service and
[36:02] the remainder of this service now in
[36:05] Jesus precious name we ask it. Amen.
[36:08] &gt;&gt; Amen. Ecclesiastes chapter 3 starting
[36:10] with verse number one. to everything.
[36:14] There is a season
[36:17] and a time to every purpose under the
[36:20] heaven. A time to be born, a time to
[36:23] die. A time to plant and a time to pluck
[36:27] up that which is planted. A time to kill
[36:30] and a time to heal.
[36:32] A time to break down and a time to build
[36:35] up.
[36:36] A time to weep and a time to laugh. A
[36:40] time to mourn and a time to dance. A
[36:43] time to cast away stones and a time to
[36:45] gather stones together. A time to
[36:49] embrace and a time to refrain from
[36:52] embracing.
[36:54] Time to get, a time to loose, a time to
[36:57] keep, and a time to cast away.
[37:00] A time to rent, and a time to sow, a
[37:03] time to keep silence, and a time to
[37:05] speak.
[37:06] A time to love and a time to hate. A
[37:10] time of war and a time of peace. Just
[37:13] drop down to the first part of verse 11.
[37:16] He have made everything beautiful in his
[37:20] time.
[37:21] &gt;&gt; God bless you. May be seated. We want to
[37:22] talk about walking in his purpose.
[37:24] Walking in God's purpose. We see here in
[37:27] the scriptures that uh Solomon used the
[37:31] word time 24 times.
[37:34] 24 different times he uses a a space of
[37:37] time for things.
[37:40] Time is limited.
[37:44] Time is one thing that you cannot get
[37:46] back. You can't reuse. You can't redo
[37:49] it. We could say that time stinks
[37:55] because it has an end of all good
[37:57] things.
[38:00] But we all soul could say that time is a
[38:04] lifesaver when you're going through what
[38:06] we would call hell on earth
[38:08] &gt;&gt; and you want it over with. You want the
[38:10] pain done and you want to move on.
[38:15] &gt;&gt; We're glad that it's over.
[38:18] We've heard the saying this too will
[38:20] pass.
[38:22] &gt;&gt; Something to always bear in mind when
[38:26] you're suffering.
[38:28] Time is limited. One thing for sure is
[38:33] that time is limited.
[38:36] Time is for a season and to everything
[38:41] there is a time. Brother Brandham said
[38:44] time is an allotted space.
[38:47] &gt;&gt; In other words, time is just allotted a
[38:50] space in eternity.
[38:51] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[38:52] &gt;&gt; And we got a couple quotes on that that
[38:54] we want to talk about. But we've heard
[38:56] the saying only what's done for Christ
[39:01] will last.
[39:02] &gt;&gt; And then it's kind of been maybe
[39:04] perfected um that only what's done for
[39:08] Christ and by Christ will last.
[39:13] So
[39:16] everything that's um that we we do down
[39:20] here on earth, anything that has a
[39:23] beginning has an end.
[39:26] In other words, um it's it's not going
[39:30] to matter in eternity. It ju it just
[39:33] doesn't matter in eternity. Now, here's
[39:36] what is to me the such a beautiful thing
[39:39] this morning. That down here in the
[39:42] temporal life that we live in,
[39:45] that we can tap into eternity and
[39:48] literally
[39:50] perform eternal things that will matter
[39:53] on the other side. Amen.
[39:55] &gt;&gt; That we're literally tapping into heaven
[39:58] down here
[39:59] &gt;&gt; and be able to be part of eternity down
[40:03] here.
[40:05] &gt;&gt; It's not just everything's temporal. We
[40:07] wait to get to heaven to find out, you
[40:08] know, what's going on. No, we can be in
[40:11] tune down here because God is down here
[40:14] with an eternal purpose. Ephesians 3
[40:17] talks to us about an eternal purpose.
[40:20] Revelations 10 verse 5 says, "And the
[40:24] angel which I saw stand upon the sea and
[40:27] upon the earth lifted up his hand to
[40:31] heaven. And he swear by him that liveth
[40:34] forever and ever, who created heavens,
[40:36] and the things that are there are that
[40:39] therein are, and the earth, and the
[40:42] things that uh there are uh therein are,
[40:45] and the sea, and the things which are
[40:47] therein, that there should be time
[40:52] no longer.
[40:55] no longer an end of time,
[40:58] but in the days of the voice of the
[40:59] seventh angel, when he shall begin the
[41:01] sound, the mystery of God should be
[41:03] finished as he declared to his servants
[41:04] the prophets. So, we do not have to look
[41:07] any further than this message to know
[41:09] what's going on.
[41:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[41:11] &gt;&gt; This message has everything that we need
[41:13] to make a rapture.
[41:16] &gt;&gt; We're not looking for another messenger.
[41:19] We're not looking for another message.
[41:22] What we're looking for is that this
[41:24] message that God sent be revealed to us,
[41:27] be manifested inside of us.
[41:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[41:30] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham said like this. He
[41:31] says, "We come out of eternity
[41:34] and we step into a little space of time
[41:38] here and step out of time back into
[41:42] eternity."
[41:44] &gt;&gt; That's where we could say we we never
[41:45] had a beginning.
[41:48] We were with God in his thoughts before
[41:51] there was ever a foundation of the
[41:53] world.
[41:55] &gt;&gt; So everything is moving towards the end
[41:57] of time.
[41:58] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[42:00] &gt;&gt; Everything's moving towards the end of
[42:01] an allotted space or the end of what I
[42:03] want to share with us today is an
[42:05] opportunity,
[42:07] an opportunity to fulfill our purpose.
[42:11] There's only a lot of space of time to
[42:14] make ourselves ready.
[42:16] And the Bible tells us that the
[42:18] righteous scarcely make it. So they
[42:21] scarcely make it with the allotted time
[42:23] they have
[42:24] &gt;&gt; to get ready. They don't have an
[42:26] abundance of time and they're just going
[42:27] to take part of their time and get ready
[42:29] and they can spend the rest of time
[42:31] doing whatever they want.
[42:33] It just it just doesn't work like that.
[42:36] And uh Revelations 19:7 says, "Let us be
[42:40] glad, rejoice, and give honor for the
[42:42] marriage of the lamb has come and his
[42:44] wife have made herself ready." So she
[42:47] took advantage of the time that she had
[42:50] on earth and actually got ready for the
[42:52] rapture.
[42:54] You know, there are a lot of people who
[42:57] are going to come at that day at the end
[42:59] and and say, "Why didn't we go? Why
[43:02] weren't we in the rapture? Why? Why? I
[43:06] thought and look, I got this and this
[43:08] and this and this just like the rich
[43:09] young ruler could prove that he had some
[43:13] sort of relationship with God.
[43:15] But it is to me, you know, Brother
[43:17] Brandham talks about that boy who's
[43:19] whistling in the graveyard,
[43:21] just whistling, but he's scared.
[43:24] And to me to go ahead and and and be um
[43:29] so um
[43:31] uh whistling when you don't have the
[43:33] fear of God.
[43:36] I I I think the righteous scarcely make
[43:39] it. That means uh we should serve God
[43:42] with reverence.
[43:44] &gt;&gt; Right? Because that's what the Bible
[43:45] teaches. Our God is a consuming fire and
[43:48] and and what he would ask us for us to
[43:50] do, we should be careful to make sure
[43:52] that we do it. So Jesus said in Matthew
[43:54] 24:44, "Therefore, be ye also ready, for
[43:59] in such an hour as you think not the Son
[44:01] of Man cometh." So he's not going to be
[44:03] coming 15 times. Okay, you're not ready.
[44:05] I'll come back. Like at our at our shop,
[44:08] we have our heat treat guys come. They
[44:10] pick up jobs on a regular basis.
[44:13] And sometimes he he comes and say,
[44:15] "We're not ready. Get us on the way
[44:17] back."
[44:19] But with God, there's one coming. That's
[44:21] right.
[44:22] &gt;&gt; There's no oops, I I'm going to I should
[44:24] have tried.
[44:26] &gt;&gt; This is the time that we need to care
[44:28] about what the word says we should care
[44:30] about.
[44:32] &gt;&gt; Now, a space of time was a allotted and
[44:35] only the bride, catches this, only the
[44:38] bride seizes the opportunity to make
[44:40] herself ready. And and she does. She
[44:44] does. Remember, there were 10 virgins.
[44:45] Five were wise, five were foolish. Five
[44:48] seized the opportunity to get more oil
[44:51] in their lamps. In other words, they
[44:52] they came to church and it was more,
[44:54] more, more, more of you, Lord. More. I
[44:56] need more. I want more. And they weren't
[44:58] they weren't thinking intellectually
[45:00] they have enough. Their attitude was I
[45:02] need more.
[45:03] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[45:04] &gt;&gt; And it was that group of people that
[45:07] kept pressing in, that kept wanting to
[45:09] know God in a deeper way. They kept
[45:10] wanting to become more and more in his
[45:12] image from glory on to glory, from
[45:14] service onto service. And it was that
[45:17] group
[45:19] that was ready to meet the Lord.
[45:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[45:22] &gt;&gt; Now the others, they were inspired,
[45:26] but they were inspired by a proud spirit
[45:31] of I have enough to make a rapture right
[45:34] now.
[45:35] I have enough right now. In fact, I'm in
[45:39] need of nothing. That's how Jesus
[45:41] proposes it.
[45:43] They felt no need to really press in
[45:46] anymore for me. I've done enough
[45:48] pressing.
[45:50] So just coming to church and living
[45:52] pretty clean lives was really all that
[45:55] they felt they really needed to do. They
[45:57] they didn't need to seize the
[45:58] opportunity that was given to them. And
[46:01] when they realized that they didn't have
[46:03] enough oil, right, it was at one point
[46:06] at the end that they realized that they
[46:09] didn't have enough oil as the rapture
[46:12] was beginning to take place.
[46:14] The bridegroom came out and they that
[46:17] were ready went in with him to the
[46:19] marriage and the door was shut.
[46:22] The time that was allotted for them was
[46:25] now gone.
[46:27] the door of their opportunity was shut.
[46:30] Can you say amen this morning?
[46:33] &gt;&gt; So opportunity is all around us. We live
[46:36] in a land of opportunity. We've heard
[46:38] about that in America. We all have an
[46:40] opportunity to grow, to succeed, to make
[46:43] things better, and and to get ready.
[46:46] Thomas Edison, I've quoted this many
[46:48] times, said, "Opportunity is all around
[46:50] us. It's It's missed by most people
[46:54] because it's dressed in overhauls.
[46:57] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[46:57] &gt;&gt; And it looks like work. Like, whoa.
[46:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[47:00] &gt;&gt; Uh uh. Would you do something for me? I
[47:03] don't know. What is it first? Tell me.
[47:05] &gt;&gt; You know, to to to someone who wants to
[47:08] serve, it's an opportunity.
[47:11] But to most people, it's tell me first
[47:13] and I'll let you know.
[47:15] Most people fail to recognize
[47:18] opportunities because they don't appear
[47:21] to be real easy or glamorous or up
[47:24] uplifting.
[47:26] They require hard work, perseverance,
[47:28] and dedication to succeed. And the idea
[47:31] that you you have to be willing to put
[47:33] effort uh into things is it doesn't
[47:38] appear to be opportunities for people.
[47:40] People are always looking for a quick a
[47:44] quick a quick one, right? Let's do the
[47:47] ladle the lottery. That's that's a good
[47:49] example. I mean, if I could just get
[47:51] this become rich, you know,
[47:56] it it's just it's the thinking is
[47:58] different. But I I'm saying that when
[48:03] you're not when you're not worried about
[48:05] pulling up your sleeves, you're not
[48:08] worried about working hard, you're not
[48:10] worried about giving more of your heart,
[48:12] you're not worried about spending more
[48:14] time in prayer, you're not you're not
[48:15] worried about working hard. That is when
[48:20] God can bless you.
[48:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[48:22] And if you just you take the story that
[48:24] brother Brandham gave in in the choosing
[48:26] of a bride where that uh all the all the
[48:28] ladies were going out to meet this rich
[48:30] rancher when he was going to come by and
[48:32] they were going to choose him and they
[48:34] were all just thinking that they were
[48:36] going to be the one that would be
[48:37] chosen. And and this girl uh this one
[48:42] girl she just she didn't have that type
[48:44] of attitude of um I'm look look at me
[48:49] I'm I'm I'm the best.
[48:51] &gt;&gt; Right? She she had a humble attitude and
[48:54] uh she just uh kept busy working in the
[48:58] background.
[48:59] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[49:00] &gt;&gt; And that was the one that was chosen.
[49:03] &gt;&gt; And you think that you know God is God
[49:06] um you know everybody wants to sit on
[49:08] the right hand left hand of Jesus,
[49:10] right? And and Jesus is it's not for me
[49:14] to give it. It's but of my father. He
[49:16] says, but I I I think you know
[49:22] God he his bride
[49:25] his bride works
[49:27] labors
[49:28] &gt;&gt; in the opportunity that's given and we
[49:30] all have an opportunity here today to
[49:32] become more in his image
[49:34] &gt;&gt; and we're called to be in his image.
[49:36] It's an opportunity. It it it's a matter
[49:38] of of of becoming one with the word and
[49:41] and marrying the word and um bring
[49:44] having that word bring forth life inside
[49:47] of us. So it may require hard work, the
[49:50] hard work of faithfulness uh to to pray,
[49:53] to read your Bible, to listen to the
[49:56] tapes, to to come to church, to teach
[49:58] your family how to love God. But it will
[50:01] pay off in the long run.
[50:04] &gt;&gt; It will dress you and get you ready for
[50:05] a rapture. I like how God told Joshua,
[50:09] "This book of the law shall not depart
[50:12] out of thy mouth." In other words,
[50:14] everything you talk about, have it
[50:16] associated with the word of God.
[50:19] But thou shalt meditate therein, day and
[50:23] night, and that thou mayest observe to
[50:26] do according to all that is written
[50:28] therein. For then thou shalt make thy
[50:33] way prosperous, and then thou shalt have
[50:37] good success. Don't you think God holds
[50:39] the key to our lives?
[50:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[50:42] &gt;&gt; Like God is not going to you if you let
[50:45] if you just speak the word all the time.
[50:47] Word, word, word, word, word, word. I
[50:49] love the word. And you meditated upon it
[50:51] day and night. Do you think God is going
[50:53] to hold back success from you?
[50:56] &gt;&gt; No. The Bible says he would not withhold
[50:58] any good thing from them that walk
[50:59] uprightly.
[51:01] &gt;&gt; I mean, it's his promise.
[51:03] &gt;&gt; And the thing is, we we're trying to do
[51:06] as least as possible and get the
[51:08] blessings of God.
[51:11] &gt;&gt; I I mean,
[51:13] how would you like to have a
[51:14] relationship with somebody? They want to
[51:16] do the very least and get the blessings.
[51:20] No, you don't want that. That that's
[51:22] that's that's not right.
[51:26] Do you know that people miss
[51:28] opportunities because they're not aware
[51:31] of what's going on around them?
[51:35] &gt;&gt; We got a scripture for that. Hebrews
[51:36] 13:2 says, "Be not forgetful to
[51:40] entertain strangers, for thereby some
[51:42] have entertained angels
[51:45] unawares."
[51:50] So we need to be careful.
[51:53] I don't want to forget.
[51:55] It might be somebody God sent by for us.
[52:00] Paul, like all of us, before we meet
[52:02] God, he was walking around in his own
[52:05] purpose. And I just want to pick up a
[52:08] little bit here in Acts 26:15.
[52:11] And I believe that at this point that
[52:14] Paul is relaying to King Agria his
[52:18] testimony, his conversion.
[52:21] And he's speaking here and he says um
[52:25] and I said who art thou Lord and he said
[52:30] I I am Jesus whom thou persecutest
[52:35] but arise and stand upon thy feet for I
[52:38] have appeared unto thee for this purpose
[52:42] to make thee a minister and a witness of
[52:45] those things which thou has seen and
[52:47] those things which in which I will
[52:49] appear unto thee. delivering thee from
[52:51] the people and from the Gentiles on unto
[52:55] whom I now send thee. I'm going to
[52:56] deliver you from them to open their eyes
[52:58] to turn them from darkness to light and
[53:00] from the power of Satan unto God that
[53:03] they might receive forgiveness of sins
[53:05] and the inheritance among them which are
[53:08] sanctified by faith that is in me.
[53:14] There's so much that could be said about
[53:16] this, but here was a man, his name was
[53:19] Saul, and he was going about serving God
[53:23] the way he wanted to,
[53:26] but he was not in the purpose of God,
[53:30] but he thought he was. But it wasn't
[53:32] until he met God, he had a real close
[53:35] encounter with God
[53:38] that God was able to show him this is
[53:41] the proper way.
[53:45] &gt;&gt; This is this is this is my purpose for
[53:47] your life. Literally, I can't give you
[53:50] your purpose for your life and nobody
[53:53] can.
[53:55] It can only come from God. But it should
[53:58] behoove us to put effort, energy, time,
[54:04] Lord, show me your purpose for my life.
[54:07] &gt;&gt; Because if we don't, we're going to
[54:09] waste our life.
[54:10] &gt;&gt; And then when we get on the other side,
[54:12] what are we going to have?
[54:14] &gt;&gt; We can't go back and say, "Look what I
[54:16] did on earth." I mean, the earth's going
[54:19] to pass away.
[54:20] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[54:20] &gt;&gt; The former things are going to be passed
[54:21] away. there's not going to be any
[54:23] bringing up of, you know, how many jobs
[54:26] we shipped out of trusted tool. It's
[54:28] just not going to be there.
[54:31] And so,
[54:33] we need to be uh storing up treasures in
[54:36] heaven. Jesus said
[54:37] &gt;&gt; where where rust doesn't uh corrupt and
[54:40] and and and be be careful to consider
[54:45] our eternal purpose. Amen.
[54:49] &gt;&gt; Now, it's amazing to me that, you know,
[54:51] so God calls Paul to be a prophet and he
[54:55] sends him to the Gentiles
[54:59] and he says, "I'm going to send you
[55:00] there, but I have to deliver you."
[55:03] Now, if I was God, this is what I would
[55:06] do. All right, my predestinated seed,
[55:10] I'm going to send a little message to
[55:11] your mind through a thought. when you
[55:13] get it, come on over to my church and
[55:17] we'll just have a service here.
[55:20] That would be so much better because
[55:21] see, there'd be no persecution. Paul
[55:23] wouldn't have to be persecuted.
[55:26] But God's way is I'm going to give the
[55:28] word out to everybody.
[55:31] &gt;&gt; And when you give the word to everybody,
[55:32] you get persecuted.
[55:33] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[55:34] &gt;&gt; They that live godly in Christ Jesus
[55:37] shall suffer persecution.
[55:39] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[55:40] &gt;&gt; And that's God's way.
[55:42] It's not our way, but it's his way.
[55:46] Now,
[55:48] so turn with me to Luke 19. Jerusalem
[55:52] missed their opportunity to receive
[55:54] God's grace. Just I just want to go
[55:56] through some examples here.
[55:59] Luke 19:41. And when he was come near,
[56:02] he beheld the city and he wept over it.
[56:05] And this is what he said about
[56:07] Jerusalem. If thou hast known even thou
[56:12] at least at least in this thy day the
[56:17] things which they belong unto thy peace.
[56:21] You've ever wanted peace before. God has
[56:24] a peace that belongs to you. I believe
[56:26] that with all my heart. But now they are
[56:30] hid from thine eyes.
[56:32] For the day shall come upon thee, that
[56:35] thine enemy shall cast a trench round
[56:37] about thee, and capest thee round, and
[56:39] keep thee in every on every side, and
[56:42] shall lay thee even within the ground,
[56:44] and thy children within thee. And they
[56:46] shall not leave in thee one stone upon
[56:48] another, all because
[56:51] thou kneest not the time of thy
[56:56] visitation.
[56:59] If thou has known
[57:04] the things that really belong to you,
[57:09] then you you would have received them.
[57:14] But because you weren't really paying
[57:15] attention when you came to church,
[57:20] you missed your time of visitation.
[57:26] So there was a time
[57:28] that Jerusalem, the door was shut on
[57:30] Jerusalem
[57:33] and the door opened up to the Gentiles.
[57:35] I want to pick that up in Acts Acts
[57:37] 13:46 here. Acts 13:46. Then Paul and
[57:41] Barnabas waxed bold and said,
[57:46] "It was necessary that the word of God
[57:49] should first have been spoken to you,
[57:53] but seeing speaking to the Jews, but
[57:56] seeing that ye put it off from you, and
[58:00] judged yourself unworthy
[58:04] of everlasting life, lo, we turn to the
[58:09] Gentiles.
[58:11] For so have the Lord commanded us,
[58:14] saying, I have set thee to be a light of
[58:17] the Gentiles, that thou shouldest be
[58:20] that thou shouldest be for salvation
[58:22] unto the ends of the earth. And when the
[58:25] Gentiles heard this, they were glad and
[58:27] they glorified what? The word of the
[58:30] Lord. They just didn't say, "I glorify
[58:33] God."
[58:34] They glorified the word. The word is
[58:38] what God is. We need to be born by the
[58:40] word. The word is if we want to know
[58:42] God, know the word.
[58:46] &gt;&gt; Receive the word. When you receive the
[58:47] word, you automatically receive the Holy
[58:50] Ghost.
[58:52] When you receive the living word, not
[58:55] not
[58:57] just an intellectual word, right? That
[59:00] that just puffs you up. But the Holy
[59:03] Ghost is will bring the manifestation of
[59:06] God to your life.
[59:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[59:09] So they glorified the word of the Lord
[59:11] and as many as were ordained to eternal
[59:15] life, they believed. It's real simple.
[59:18] When you believe, that's evidence you
[59:20] got eternal life. It's that simple. It's
[59:24] the fact that you believe, but when
[59:27] you're you're you're you're you're not
[59:30] taking that word seriously and you're
[59:32] just maybe intellectually believing
[59:33] certain parts of it or you wanted to
[59:36] pick and choose what you're going to
[59:37] believe. You know, that that is such
[59:40] scary ground. That's all I can tell you
[59:43] because that there's no scripture for
[59:44] that. As many as were ordained to
[59:48] eternal life believed.
[59:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[59:50] &gt;&gt; If you're seed, you're going to believe.
[59:52] Amen.
[59:53] &gt;&gt; Oh, I just love the word today.
[59:55] &gt;&gt; The door to the Jews was shut and the
[59:57] door to the Gentiles was opened.
[1:00:00] &gt;&gt; The Jews missed their time of
[1:00:02] visitation.
[1:00:04] They just they did they weren't paying
[1:00:06] attention. You know, the the worst thing
[1:00:08] to do is come to church and not pay
[1:00:09] attention.
[1:00:10] &gt;&gt; You know, I say, you know, the because I
[1:00:13] believe that God has ordained
[1:00:16] he's ordained a five-fold ministry
[1:00:19] to get us perfection.
[1:00:21] &gt;&gt; Amen. And um
[1:00:24] the way that brother Bronham taught it
[1:00:26] in church order that everybody ought to
[1:00:29] have a home church, everybody ought to
[1:00:32] have a pastor, everybody ought to be
[1:00:34] under a local body and
[1:00:37] &gt;&gt; and to be able to function together as a
[1:00:40] family and learn how to work out
[1:00:41] problems and care about one another and
[1:00:44] pray for one another.
[1:00:46] &gt;&gt; It it it's it's like you would have a
[1:00:48] natural family. You wouldn't want, you
[1:00:50] know, your your your children not caring
[1:00:52] about the other children, right?
[1:00:55] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:00:55] &gt;&gt; So, it it's it's no different in a
[1:00:58] spiritual family that there there needs
[1:01:00] to be a love one for another. That's why
[1:01:02] Jesus said, "Love one another. By this
[1:01:04] shall all men know you're my disciples."
[1:01:07] So, there was a time for the Jews and
[1:01:09] and now there's a a time for the the
[1:01:12] Gentiles. To everything, there's a
[1:01:14] season and a time to every purpose under
[1:01:16] the heaven. And God's purpose for this
[1:01:19] season was to take a bride out of the
[1:01:22] Gentiles
[1:01:25] &gt;&gt; for eternity.
[1:01:28] &gt;&gt; He couldn't take him out of the Jews.
[1:01:29] Taking them out of the Gentiles.
[1:01:32] &gt;&gt; Now soon that door is going to be
[1:01:35] closed.
[1:01:37] &gt;&gt; The time for the Gentiles is going to be
[1:01:39] closed.
[1:01:42] &gt;&gt; And he's going back to the Jews
[1:01:45] &gt;&gt; to get a remnant.
[1:01:47] And so I I'm I'm just saying this
[1:01:49] because there's a time for you, James.
[1:01:53] There's a time for you, Joy. There's a
[1:01:55] time for you, brother Ron. There's a
[1:01:57] time for all of us.
[1:01:58] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:01:59] &gt;&gt; We only have an allotted time.
[1:02:01] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:02:02] &gt;&gt; And you know, I don't know what that
[1:02:03] time is.
[1:02:06] &gt;&gt; By the grace of God, I'm living here. I
[1:02:07] can go I I can take we can all just take
[1:02:09] a bus down to the cemetery and I can
[1:02:12] show you many tombstones with ages
[1:02:15] younger than you.
[1:02:18] &gt;&gt; We have no promise of tomorrow.
[1:02:20] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:02:22] &gt;&gt; But God is here with a real voice who
[1:02:25] really wants to speak to our hearts and
[1:02:27] show us our purpose for his economy.
[1:02:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:02:34] And we got examples of many people in
[1:02:37] this Bible who missed their
[1:02:39] opportunities. Turn with me to Matthew
[1:02:41] chapter 19.
[1:02:43] Most people want to know to get to
[1:02:45] heaven. Can you say amen?
[1:02:48] &gt;&gt; But they don't want to pay the
[1:02:50] admission.
[1:02:51] &gt;&gt; They don't want to pay the mission.
[1:02:55] &gt;&gt; There is an admission. You know there is
[1:03:02] Most people got the understanding Jesus
[1:03:04] died for me on the cross. I got I accept
[1:03:06] it and I got eternal life.
[1:03:11] In other words, I I I I accept this and
[1:03:14] I got eternal life. And that's it. That
[1:03:17] intellectual belief has Satan has used
[1:03:20] to deceive a lot of people.
[1:03:24] So, Matthew 19:16, we see here we we
[1:03:27] know this this man is a rich young
[1:03:28] ruler. Behold, one came and said unto
[1:03:31] him,"Good Master, what shall I do that I
[1:03:33] may have eternal life?" And he said unto
[1:03:36] them, "Why callst thou me good? There is
[1:03:37] none good but one that is God. But but
[1:03:40] if but if thou wil enter into life,
[1:03:47] keep the commandments." That's a little
[1:03:50] bit more than accepting the blood. Right
[1:03:54] &gt;&gt; now you got to start doing something if
[1:03:57] you do believe in the blood. He saith
[1:04:00] unto him which and Jesus said thou shalt
[1:04:03] not thou shalt do no murder. Thou shalt
[1:04:06] not commit adultery. Thou shalt not
[1:04:07] steal. Thou shalt not bear false witness
[1:04:09] honor thy father and thy mother. And
[1:04:11] this man said
[1:04:14] uh and and thou shalt love thy neighbor
[1:04:16] as thyself.
[1:04:18] So he didn't even say all the
[1:04:20] commandments, right?
[1:04:22] I don't think that's all 10 of them. I
[1:04:24] didn't count them. Okay. So, I'm just
[1:04:28] that that makes a difference here. But
[1:04:29] the young man saith unto him, "All these
[1:04:32] things have I kept from my youth up."
[1:04:36] So, what am I lacking? I mean, I believe
[1:04:38] that Jesus died for me. What am I
[1:04:41] lacking?
[1:04:43] And Jesus said unto him, "If thou will
[1:04:46] be perfect, go and sell sell that thou
[1:04:50] has and give it to the poor, and thou
[1:04:54] shalt have treasure in heaven, and come
[1:04:57] and follow me."
[1:05:01] But when the young man heard that
[1:05:03] saying, notice he was a young man,
[1:05:07] he went away sorrowful, for he had great
[1:05:10] possessions.
[1:05:12] And Jesus said unto his disciples,
[1:05:14] verily I say unto you that a rich man
[1:05:16] shall hardly enter into the kingdom of
[1:05:18] heaven. I just want to say that this man
[1:05:20] met Jesus.
[1:05:23] There was a visitation.
[1:05:25] There was an opportunity. There was a
[1:05:27] lot of time given to him.
[1:05:30] And all he had to say is yes,
[1:05:33] but he did not want to pay the admission
[1:05:36] fee.
[1:05:37] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:05:40] &gt;&gt; And he missed his time of visitation.
[1:05:44] Now, we know this. We know this because
[1:05:46] a prophet came on the scene.
[1:05:49] And let's pick it up in Luke chapter 16.
[1:05:57] This rich man missed his purpose on
[1:06:00] earth. He missed his personal
[1:06:02] visitation.
[1:06:04] You know, we all I say this for sure.
[1:06:06] Did you know every person
[1:06:09] gets visited by the truth in their life?
[1:06:14] &gt;&gt; Most of them do not recognize it,
[1:06:20] &gt;&gt; but it ain't God's fault.
[1:06:22] And and I you know talking about the
[1:06:24] beginning if I know you would have been
[1:06:26] here. Did did you know did you know that
[1:06:30] whether you're here or not here God's
[1:06:32] still preaching to you
[1:06:34] &gt;&gt; and you're still accountable to the word
[1:06:36] even though you're not here.
[1:06:38] &gt;&gt; A lot of people think like this. Well if
[1:06:39] I don't go I don't I don't have to worry
[1:06:41] about I don't have to pay tithe. I don't
[1:06:42] have to pay my offering. I don't have to
[1:06:43] worry about because I'm not there.
[1:06:45] That's not true.
[1:06:46] &gt;&gt; That's not true in God's economy.
[1:06:50] We have a position. We have a post of
[1:06:52] duty. We're to be here. And um because
[1:06:56] God has a family, it's not a part-time
[1:06:59] family.
[1:07:00] &gt;&gt; All right. Luke chapter 16 verse 19.
[1:07:02] There was a certain rich man was clothed
[1:07:05] in purple and fine linen. Did you
[1:07:08] understand? This is why I'm wearing
[1:07:09] purple today.
[1:07:11] Brother, do you know brother Ron and I
[1:07:13] match again today? This like the second
[1:07:15] service. Like
[1:07:17] that's I thought that's pretty neat. No,
[1:07:20] it just happens. You just you end up
[1:07:22] going to church and you find out who you
[1:07:23] match.
[1:07:28] And there was a certain beggar named
[1:07:31] Lazarus, which was laid at the gate full
[1:07:34] of sores, and desiring to be fed with
[1:07:37] the crumbs which fell from the rich
[1:07:39] man's table. Moreover, the dogs came,
[1:07:42] and he licked his sores. And it came to
[1:07:44] pass that the beggar died and was
[1:07:46] carried by the angels into Abraham's
[1:07:48] bosom. And um the the rich man also died
[1:07:52] and was buried. Now in hell, notice he's
[1:07:56] already identifying where he's at. In
[1:07:58] hell, he lifted up his eyes being in
[1:08:01] torments and saith to Abraham a far off
[1:08:04] so he could see into the other dimension
[1:08:05] at this point.
[1:08:07] Um and Lazarus in his bosom. And he
[1:08:10] cried and said, "Father Abraham, have
[1:08:12] mercy on me." and send Lazarus that he
[1:08:15] may dip the tip of his finger in water
[1:08:19] and cool my tongue for I am in torment
[1:08:21] in this flame. But Abraham said, "Son,"
[1:08:25] now this is the part we want to get to.
[1:08:27] There was a a time of visitation.
[1:08:30] Abraham's calling him son. And he's he's
[1:08:32] in hell.
[1:08:35] Son, remember that thou in thy lifetime
[1:08:37] receivest good things and likewise la
[1:08:41] Lazarus evil things. But now he is
[1:08:44] comforted and thou art tormented. And
[1:08:47] besides all this between us and you
[1:08:51] there's a great gulf fixed. It's fixed.
[1:08:54] You can't change it. So that they which
[1:08:57] would pass from hence ye cannot come.
[1:09:00] Neither can they pass to us that would
[1:09:02] come from thence. And he said, I pray
[1:09:06] thee therefore father that thou would
[1:09:09] send him to my father's house. If this
[1:09:10] is the real truth and I I can't get any
[1:09:13] water, we can't get connected, we can't
[1:09:16] ever have fellowship again, then please
[1:09:18] go back and tell my brothers, tell my
[1:09:21] family so they don't come to this place
[1:09:23] of torment.
[1:09:24] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:09:26] &gt;&gt; For I have five brethren that he may
[1:09:28] testify unto them, lest they also come
[1:09:30] into this place of torment. And Abraham
[1:09:32] saith unto him, they have Moses and the
[1:09:35] prophets. Let them hear them. And he
[1:09:38] said, "Nay, Father Abraham.
[1:09:42] Nay, nay, Father Abraham." They don't
[1:09:45] listen when they go to church.
[1:09:49] They They don't listen when they go to
[1:09:50] church.
[1:09:52] &gt;&gt; But if one went to them from the dead,
[1:09:55] they will repent. And he said unto them,
[1:09:58] "If they hear not Moses and the
[1:10:00] prophets, neither will they be
[1:10:01] persuaded, though one rose from the
[1:10:03] dead."
[1:10:07] time of visitation.
[1:10:11] There's a time of visitation.
[1:10:16] It's not not just serious and sober, but
[1:10:19] it's it's really glorious.
[1:10:22] I I'd rather hold hands with Jesus
[1:10:26] than wonder, is he with me?
[1:10:29] Right now, it's not all up to Jesus.
[1:10:33] It's it's up to me to want Jesus to hold
[1:10:35] my hand.
[1:10:38] &gt;&gt; Now, here is a man who looked for his
[1:10:40] time of visitation and he took
[1:10:43] opportunity of it. It's in Luke chapter
[1:10:45] 19. If you want to turn with me, Luke
[1:10:48] chapter 19. He had a purpose to fulfill
[1:10:51] and he came uh to the conclusion that
[1:10:54] his life wasn't going to really amount
[1:10:57] to anything down here. It was just
[1:10:58] temporal and he wanted to be a part of
[1:11:01] eternity.
[1:11:03] And we can pick it up here. He felt he
[1:11:06] was created to serve the Lord. And Jesus
[1:11:09] entered in verse one of chapter 19 of
[1:11:11] Luke. And he passed through Jericho. And
[1:11:14] behold, there was a man named Zach
[1:11:17] Zakius,
[1:11:18] which was the chief among the publicans.
[1:11:21] And he was rich. And he sought to see
[1:11:23] Jesus who he was. And and he could not
[1:11:25] for the press, for he was of little
[1:11:27] statue. So he was a chief. He was rich,
[1:11:30] but he was little.
[1:11:32] And um so he ran before and climbed up
[1:11:35] into a sycamore tree to see him, for he
[1:11:37] was to pass that way. And when Jesus
[1:11:40] came to that place, he looked up and saw
[1:11:42] him and said, "Zakius, make haste and
[1:11:45] come down, for today I must abide at thy
[1:11:48] house." What a privilege. What a
[1:11:50] privilege. What an what a privilege. And
[1:11:53] you know Jesus lives in every one of us.
[1:11:56] &gt;&gt; Amen. and and when we invite one another
[1:11:59] over,
[1:12:01] what you've done to the least of these,
[1:12:03] you've done unto me.
[1:12:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:12:05] &gt;&gt; That's what Jesus said. And he made
[1:12:07] haste and he came down and received him
[1:12:09] joyfully. And when he when they saw it,
[1:12:12] they all murmured.
[1:12:14] They all murmured and said that he has
[1:12:17] gone to be with a guest with a man that
[1:12:20] is a sinner.
[1:12:23] And Jesus knew he was a sinner. He knew
[1:12:25] I was a sinner. He knew you were a
[1:12:27] sinner.
[1:12:28] &gt;&gt; It didn't stop him from coming by and
[1:12:29] getting us.
[1:12:32] &gt;&gt; And Zakius stood and said unto the Lord,
[1:12:34] "Behold, Lord, the half of all my goods,
[1:12:38] I I give it to the poor, and if I've
[1:12:40] taken anything from any man by false
[1:12:43] acquisition, I restore him four-fold."
[1:12:50] And Jesus said unto him, "This day is
[1:12:54] salvation. Come to this house, for as
[1:12:57] much as he also is a son of Abraham, for
[1:12:59] the Son of Man is come to seek and to
[1:13:02] save that which was lost."
[1:13:05] So Zakius
[1:13:08] recognized his day of visitation, his
[1:13:11] time of visitation.
[1:13:13] He took advantage of that and didn't he
[1:13:16] didn't say,"Well, you know, Brother
[1:13:18] John, I'm going to take some time and
[1:13:19] I'm going to think about this. I'm going
[1:13:22] to think about it.
[1:13:25] You know, I'm going to just spend a
[1:13:26] little bit of time praying about it and
[1:13:28] thinking about it." Well, how many times
[1:13:29] we spend time thinking about it, praying
[1:13:31] about it, and we forgot it like a month
[1:13:33] ago.
[1:13:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:13:35] &gt;&gt; It's a trick from the enemy.
[1:13:40] Today is the day to respond to God.
[1:13:43] &gt;&gt; Do not wait till tomorrow. That's right.
[1:13:45] &gt;&gt; You You've given the devil 24 more hours
[1:13:47] to work with you and give you reasons
[1:13:49] not to move forward with God, not to
[1:13:51] move, you know, giving you the the
[1:13:54] thought that you can you always got
[1:13:56] tomorrow. Like, get me that scripture
[1:13:59] and then I'll believe it. But it's not.
[1:14:02] Satan's always trying to get us off
[1:14:05] track.
[1:14:08] We have
[1:14:10] only a set time to do what God's called
[1:14:14] us to do in his eternal purpose.
[1:14:16] &gt;&gt; And we don't want to miss that.
[1:14:19] Another story here is in 2 Kings chapter
[1:14:22] 2. Elisha, he was a prophet and he
[1:14:26] wanted a double portion. You know how
[1:14:28] many how many knows what he wanted a
[1:14:30] double portion of?
[1:14:32] He wanted a double portion of what? the
[1:14:36] Holy Ghost.
[1:14:38] &gt;&gt; He wanted a double portion of the Holy
[1:14:40] Ghost. He was a prophet and he wanted a
[1:14:42] double portion.
[1:14:45] &gt;&gt; And I don't understand it why, you know,
[1:14:48] we're content with how much spirit we
[1:14:50] have.
[1:14:52] &gt;&gt; He was a prophet. I want a double
[1:14:54] portion of what Elijah had.
[1:14:57] &gt;&gt; We have not because we ask not.
[1:15:00] &gt;&gt; I think I'd rather ask
[1:15:03] I'd rather ask in
[1:15:06] and come short
[1:15:08] &gt;&gt; then then not ask and and come way way
[1:15:12] way short.
[1:15:15] &gt;&gt; So we can pick it up here in 2 Kings
[1:15:17] chapter 2 verse 9 says and it came to
[1:15:20] pass when they were gone over that
[1:15:22] Elijah said unto Elisha
[1:15:27] I I want to help you. I want to bless
[1:15:29] you before I leave. ask what I shall do
[1:15:31] for thee before I be taken away from
[1:15:34] you. And Elisha said, I pray thee, let a
[1:15:38] double portion of thy spirit be upon me.
[1:15:46] &gt;&gt; Well, I'll tell you what's missing today
[1:15:48] is a hunger.
[1:15:49] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:15:50] &gt;&gt; For more of God.
[1:15:52] &gt;&gt; People are too satisfied with what they
[1:15:54] got. the but Jesus said blessed are they
[1:15:56] that hunger and thirst after
[1:15:57] righteousness for they shall be filled
[1:16:01] and he said
[1:16:03] you've asked a hard thing
[1:16:06] nevertheless if you see me when I'm
[1:16:09] taken away from you it shall it shall be
[1:16:12] so unto you but if you don't see me when
[1:16:15] I'm taken away it shall not be so
[1:16:20] Elisha did not want to miss this opport
[1:16:23] opportunity
[1:16:25] this I mean there's one thing there's
[1:16:28] one thing that was important to Elisha
[1:16:32] and that was having more than what
[1:16:34] Elijah had not a little bit more but
[1:16:38] twice as much
[1:16:41] and so
[1:16:43] he couldn't he couldn't just say let me
[1:16:45] know when you feel that spirit you know
[1:16:47] when you when you're starting to feel
[1:16:48] that rapture you know start to leave
[1:16:51] give me a call I'll be right
[1:16:55] It wasn't that that carnal,
[1:16:58] &gt;&gt; but I could just imagine Elisha being
[1:17:04] stuck next to Elijah
[1:17:08] like sleep sleeping with one eye open
[1:17:13] &gt;&gt; like I'm not leaving you out of my
[1:17:15] sight.
[1:17:15] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:17:18] &gt;&gt; You're going to the bathroom. Let's go.
[1:17:20] &gt;&gt; You're going to the store. Let's go.
[1:17:22] you're going to your mom's. Let's go.
[1:17:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:17:26] &gt;&gt; Because it he didn't want to miss his
[1:17:28] time of visitation.
[1:17:31] &gt;&gt; Because it only, you know, a raptures in
[1:17:33] the twinkling of an eye.
[1:17:34] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:17:36] &gt;&gt; And if he would have just turned a
[1:17:38] little bit,
[1:17:40] God was able to take him up in the
[1:17:41] rapture and him not get it.
[1:17:43] &gt;&gt; That's right. But I think God was
[1:17:45] looking at Elisha and seeing the desire
[1:17:47] was so strong that he was sincere that
[1:17:51] he wanted to really work more for the
[1:17:53] Lord to it's what he he did, right? He
[1:17:57] literally did. He performed twice the
[1:17:59] amount of miracles.
[1:18:01] And I think that's what is needed today
[1:18:04] is we're we're needing a heart and a
[1:18:06] desire to not miss our visitation. Like
[1:18:08] I'm going to meet God when I go to
[1:18:10] church. Something's going to happen.
[1:18:12] Amen.
[1:18:14] &gt;&gt; We we we we we serve a living God.
[1:18:19] But you notice we have to get into the
[1:18:21] spirit, right?
[1:18:23] &gt;&gt; They that worship me must worship me in
[1:18:25] the spirit. It it's not good enough to
[1:18:28] just only meditate.
[1:18:30] &gt;&gt; Sometimes we got to break through into
[1:18:32] the spirit and and get in the presence
[1:18:34] of God and let him come down. And this
[1:18:38] is the truth. Um,
[1:18:41] I was praying um this morning and
[1:18:45] something happens when you pray.
[1:18:47] &gt;&gt; When you pray, things come to you that
[1:18:50] you weren't even thinking about.
[1:18:53] &gt;&gt; But when you're just trying your best,
[1:18:55] you know, you know, to study and what
[1:18:58] would be good and you know, that only
[1:19:00] lasts so much. You really got to ask God
[1:19:04] to come in and have his way. Amen.
[1:19:07] &gt;&gt; And that prayer, that time of humility
[1:19:10] where you get on your knees and you just
[1:19:12] say, "God, I need you. I need you." What
[1:19:15] What do you want for your people? What
[1:19:17] do they need, Lord? And the inspiration
[1:19:20] comes. This is why I believe in serving
[1:19:23] a real God,
[1:19:25] &gt;&gt; not just uh some formality of going to
[1:19:28] church and when church is over. But no,
[1:19:31] we serve a real God. I believe that
[1:19:34] Elijah, you know what he had to do to
[1:19:36] get his visitation? He had to give up a
[1:19:39] lot of things.
[1:19:41] He he probably had his his volleyball,
[1:19:45] his um his um his bowling, his knitting,
[1:19:50] his um fishing club, his um his hunting.
[1:19:56] I mean, he he he had to suffer a lot. He
[1:19:58] had to give up a lot.
[1:20:00] &gt;&gt; That's right. because he had to keep his
[1:20:01] eyes on Elijah.
[1:20:04] &gt;&gt; And I'm I'm gonna say this. We need to
[1:20:06] get serious about our visitation.
[1:20:08] &gt;&gt; We got to spend some more time at home
[1:20:10] in prayer and get ready to meet God when
[1:20:12] we come to churchmen
[1:20:14] &gt;&gt; because I believe we can receive more if
[1:20:16] we empty out more. We can just empty out
[1:20:19] of the things of the world and and and
[1:20:21] and say, "God, fill me with the eternal
[1:20:23] things of God."
[1:20:26] &gt;&gt; There's a purpose for you, a purpose for
[1:20:29] your life.
[1:20:31] Did you know it's not for you to choose
[1:20:33] what your purpose is?
[1:20:36] &gt;&gt; I remember as a child I I wanted to be a
[1:20:39] number of things and you've heard me and
[1:20:41] like most people that are in the world
[1:20:43] they you know what do you want to be
[1:20:44] when you grow up and what do you want to
[1:20:46] do and and all these things
[1:20:49] and to someone who doesn't know God it's
[1:20:52] just natural. It's just natural. What do
[1:20:54] you you got you got to choose. But when
[1:20:57] you come into God's economy, it's not
[1:20:59] about you choosing what your purpose is.
[1:21:02] It's you finding out what his purpose is
[1:21:05] for your life. And it takes God, I don't
[1:21:08] know what you want me to do, but I
[1:21:11] believe you can show me.
[1:21:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:21:14] &gt;&gt; And I'll say it like this. Even when you
[1:21:17] know
[1:21:19] like Moses's mother
[1:21:23] taught Moses that you're going to be a
[1:21:26] deliverer.
[1:21:30] And so he with all his ability, I'm a
[1:21:33] deliverer. I'm going to deliver my
[1:21:34] people. He still didn't have God on the
[1:21:38] inside showing him how to do it. Amen.
[1:21:41] &gt;&gt; So even if we have the knowledge of what
[1:21:43] we're supposed to be doing, we still
[1:21:45] need the Holy Ghost inside directing us
[1:21:47] how to do it.
[1:21:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:21:49] And so, and the longer we wait, did you
[1:21:52] know the longer you're going to spend
[1:21:53] time in the wilderness,
[1:21:56] &gt;&gt; you know, going through hardships, you
[1:21:59] know, Moses went through what, 40 years?
[1:22:02] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:22:03] &gt;&gt; Of hardships to get the old, brother Ram
[1:22:06] says, to get that old
[1:22:09] system out of him.
[1:22:10] &gt;&gt; That's right. that whole way of
[1:22:11] thinking, that carnal way of thinking.
[1:22:14] He finally got to a place where
[1:22:18] Lord, I I can't go down there. Very
[1:22:21] humble. In fact, he was the meakest man
[1:22:24] on the earth to the time of Jesus
[1:22:26] Christ.
[1:22:28] &gt;&gt; That's what trials eventually do to you.
[1:22:32] Now, all things
[1:22:35] were created for God's purpose.
[1:22:41] So, it's not about us choosing what kind
[1:22:43] of purpose we want to have in life.
[1:22:46] It's about finding what God's purpose is
[1:22:48] for us.
[1:22:50] Um, you know, when you're trying to get
[1:22:52] some information and back in the day,
[1:22:54] brother Ron, when we went to school, we
[1:22:56] went to what's called a library.
[1:22:59] And in the library, we would check out
[1:23:02] books and we would learn about things by
[1:23:05] reading books. Well, today, you know,
[1:23:08] you just pull your phone out and you can
[1:23:11] learn the same thing and probably a lot
[1:23:13] of other stuff that's not true.
[1:23:19] God is here to reveal to us our purpose.
[1:23:23] &gt;&gt; Amen. Colossians 1:16 says, "For by him
[1:23:27] were all things created that are in
[1:23:29] heaven and that are in earth,
[1:23:34] the visible things and the invisible
[1:23:35] things.
[1:23:38] You know, the atoms and all the things
[1:23:40] that we don't see, God created them. And
[1:23:42] whether they be thrones or dominions,
[1:23:44] principalities or powers, all things
[1:23:47] were created by him and for him."
[1:23:52] Now, usually moms, how many moms we got
[1:23:54] here? Well, and dads, how many when you
[1:23:58] make dinner, you do not just make it for
[1:24:02] yourself, but you make it for others.
[1:24:08] But now when you go
[1:24:11] and you're going to go to a restaurant
[1:24:13] and you order something
[1:24:17] and
[1:24:19] uh you know brother brother Marty he's a
[1:24:21] very very
[1:24:23] he's a very cordial guy.
[1:24:27] He is he's my mentor.
[1:24:31] and he goes to the restaurant and he
[1:24:33] says, "I would like
[1:24:38] uh some fish." Because that's the last
[1:24:41] we got some fish when we went out.
[1:24:44] And if they they bring out some lobster
[1:24:48] tails and some shrimp
[1:24:51] and they say, "Here,
[1:24:54] well, at this point, I didn't order
[1:24:56] that."
[1:24:59] And when you go to a restaurant, you
[1:25:00] order stuff and they don't give it to
[1:25:02] you. You don't say, "Oh, yeah. Thanks.
[1:25:03] This is what I wanted."
[1:25:07] In fact, you're thinking about,
[1:25:10] "I should let them know this is not what
[1:25:12] I ordered."
[1:25:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:25:14] &gt;&gt; And to think that God would create you
[1:25:17] for his purpose
[1:25:19] and you say, "Well, Lord, I got my own
[1:25:21] thing going on."
[1:25:24] &gt;&gt; How is he going to feel about that?
[1:25:28] So now, I'm not saying this for you.
[1:25:31] You're God's children. You want to do
[1:25:33] God's will. But we we live in a world
[1:25:34] out there with people that are just full
[1:25:36] of doing their own thing. That's right.
[1:25:38] &gt;&gt; Doing their own purpose. In fact, many
[1:25:41] of them stand behind the pulpit because
[1:25:42] they want money. They want popularity.
[1:25:45] They they it's let's do a concert. Let's
[1:25:48] do entertainment. There's a lot of lot
[1:25:52] of things that that really are not just
[1:25:54] for his glory. Amen.
[1:25:57] &gt;&gt; And I want to say that God is a jealous
[1:25:59] God.
[1:26:00] &gt;&gt; And he does not want to share your time
[1:26:04] &gt;&gt; with your purpose.
[1:26:06] &gt;&gt; He wants you to seek to find out what
[1:26:10] your purpose is. And I'm telling you,
[1:26:12] your purpose in Christ is going to be
[1:26:14] connected to his eternal purpose
[1:26:18] because you were created for him.
[1:26:22] The flowers,
[1:26:24] God creates the flowers for him. The
[1:26:27] trees, the animals, everything brings
[1:26:30] God glory and honor because they're
[1:26:33] displaying his beauty. We as his
[1:26:37] children, we when we're with with the
[1:26:40] mind of Christ talking about the word,
[1:26:44] meditating upon, wanting to bring God
[1:26:46] honor through our lives, then we can
[1:26:49] fulfill the purpose of God.
[1:26:52] But we can't do it with a carnal mind.
[1:26:53] Right?
[1:26:55] All right. The So I just want to read
[1:26:57] this uh verse 17. Um for he is before
[1:27:01] all things and by him all things
[1:27:02] consistent. He is the head of the body,
[1:27:04] the church who is the beginning of the
[1:27:05] firstborn of the dead that in all things
[1:27:07] he might have the preeminence. So if I
[1:27:11] was to say to brother Ron, brother Ron,
[1:27:13] what does God want in your life? That
[1:27:16] preeminence. Brother James, what does
[1:27:17] God want in your life? Preeminence.
[1:27:21] It's through the preeminence that he can
[1:27:24] take free more agencies who can go
[1:27:26] either way and fulfill his purpose.
[1:27:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:27:30] &gt;&gt; But it's only if he gets preeminence
[1:27:32] because he's God. He created us. He
[1:27:35] could make us a robot if he wanted to.
[1:27:37] But you know what that would remind me
[1:27:39] of? That would remind me of a
[1:27:40] manipulator.
[1:27:45] But he says, "Her if if you would like
[1:27:48] to serve me, then I put it in your
[1:27:52] heart. You serve me."
[1:27:55] 24 elders in heaven cast their crowns
[1:27:58] down and said, "Thou art worthy, oh
[1:27:59] Lord, to receive glory and honor and
[1:28:02] power. For thou has created all things,
[1:28:04] and for thy pleasure they are and were
[1:28:07] created." So now we were created for the
[1:28:12] pleasure of God.
[1:28:16] the very pleasure of God to make him
[1:28:18] happy. Ephesians 1:1, in whom also we
[1:28:22] have obtained an inheritance being
[1:28:23] predestinated according to the purpose
[1:28:25] of him who workketh all things after the
[1:28:29] counsel of his own will.
[1:28:38] I want to be part of that.
[1:28:42] Uh, you know, Judas was used to fulfill
[1:28:45] the purpose of God.
[1:28:47] But notice where he ended up,
[1:28:50] the third of the angels
[1:28:53] to fulfill a a a purpose,
[1:28:57] but it wasn't eternal,
[1:29:00] right? It wasn't eternal. They they they
[1:29:03] they have a beginning, they have an end,
[1:29:05] but we have been called to an eternal
[1:29:07] purpose.
[1:29:09] It's not just naturally down here, but
[1:29:12] eternal purpose. And it's up to us to
[1:29:14] dig in and find out what that is for us.
[1:29:17] It's not for us to choose what we want
[1:29:19] our purpose to be. We do not tell God
[1:29:23] what we what his purpose is for our
[1:29:25] lives. We do not pick and choose what we
[1:29:27] want. God has a perfect will for our
[1:29:30] lives. And as long as we are alive, God
[1:29:32] has a purpose for our lives.
[1:29:35] &gt;&gt; Amen. And when he's done,
[1:29:38] he's never taken anybody
[1:29:41] before it was time.
[1:29:48] And it is his pleasure and not our not
[1:29:51] ours. God created us for his good
[1:29:54] pleasure, not for our pleasure.
[1:29:56] God's creation,
[1:29:59] as God's creation, our responsibility is
[1:30:02] to love the Lord with all our heart.
[1:30:06] Amen.
[1:30:06] &gt;&gt; In other words, to seek God's pleasure,
[1:30:10] to seek the good pleasure of his will,
[1:30:13] to seize the opportunity that we have
[1:30:15] when he comes and he visits us. To walk
[1:30:18] in God's purpose for our lives. We never
[1:30:21] want to miss when God's visiting
[1:30:25] because God is the only one that can
[1:30:28] give us power over our lives.
[1:30:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:30:31] &gt;&gt; And is how many times have we said, "I
[1:30:32] wish I wouldn't be like this. I I wish I
[1:30:35] wouldn't say that. I wish I wouldn't act
[1:30:37] like that. I wish I wish I was
[1:30:38] different. You know what I'm talking
[1:30:39] about? Well, God is the only one that
[1:30:41] holds that power. And if we humble
[1:30:43] ourselves be be underneath the mighty
[1:30:46] hand of God, he will lift us up in due
[1:30:48] season. The Bible tells us.
[1:30:51] The last verse I want to read here is in
[1:30:53] Romans chapter 8 28. And we know that
[1:30:56] all things work together for the good to
[1:30:59] them that love God and to them who are
[1:31:02] called according to whose purpose?
[1:31:05] &gt;&gt; His purpose.
[1:31:06] &gt;&gt; His purpose.
[1:31:08] His purpose.
[1:31:11] So at least give yourselves a chance
[1:31:13] every day and ask God what his purpose
[1:31:17] is for your life.
[1:31:19] Take the time to ask God, God, what is
[1:31:21] your purpose for my life? because I I I
[1:31:25] not only want to love you, I I I want to
[1:31:28] be I want to be doing your purpose.
[1:31:31] You're you're calling me to your purpose
[1:31:33] and I want to fulfill it. As the bride
[1:31:36] of Jesus Christ, our purpose can only be
[1:31:39] his purpose for our lives.
[1:31:42] It could only be h his because everybody
[1:31:45] else wanted to do their own.
[1:31:48] That's what it means to pick up your
[1:31:50] cross and follow him. To die daily. To
[1:31:52] seek those things which are above and to
[1:31:54] develop a more meaningful and purpose
[1:31:57] relationship with what? The word of God.
[1:32:01] To develop a more meaningful
[1:32:04] relationship with the word of God. The
[1:32:07] only way you can have a relationship
[1:32:08] with God is to have a relationship with
[1:32:11] his word.
[1:32:14] You can't just say I got a relationship
[1:32:16] with God but ignore his word. The word
[1:32:18] is what needs to become real more real
[1:32:21] for all of us. So we want to walk in his
[1:32:24] purpose.
[1:32:26] Walk with a purpose that matters. His
[1:32:29] purpose is the only purpose that
[1:32:31] matters. Only what's done for Christ by
[1:32:34] Christ will ever have be recognized in
[1:32:37] eternity.
[1:32:39] I just just imagine for a moment. I'm
[1:32:42] gonna take a minute here and I'm gonna
[1:32:44] I'm gonna say some joke. And really what
[1:32:47] I want is I want I want to get glory. I
[1:32:50] want people to look at me and say, "Wow,
[1:32:53] that was a good joke. I you know, I
[1:32:55] really that was a really good one. Oh,
[1:32:57] John, you know, that was a best one I
[1:32:59] ever heard."
[1:33:02] Do you actually think that's going to be
[1:33:04] an eternity?
[1:33:05] &gt;&gt; No.
[1:33:06] &gt;&gt; No. stealing glory from God, that ain't
[1:33:10] going to be an eternity.
[1:33:15] But if I share something that gives
[1:33:18] honor and glory to Jesus Christ, that
[1:33:20] will be in eternity.
[1:33:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:33:24] &gt;&gt; So we see here that
[1:33:26] we want to walk in the purpose that God
[1:33:29] has for us. They that win souls is wise.
[1:33:32] That is the eternal purpose of God is to
[1:33:36] get our family together, our spiritual
[1:33:38] family together to be ambassadors for
[1:33:41] Jesus Christ to bring the word of God to
[1:33:44] somebody who doesn't have it. And I
[1:33:47] said, "This is my prayer." And let's
[1:33:48] just stand together as we pray
[1:33:51] that we would all find it in our heart
[1:33:55] to put towards our purpose of bringing
[1:33:57] the Bible to somebody, to bring the word
[1:33:59] of God to somebody.
[1:34:04] Wouldn't you want to have people on the
[1:34:07] other side that said, "I wouldn't have
[1:34:09] made it if it it hadn't been for you."
[1:34:12] That's right.
[1:34:14] &gt;&gt; And um
[1:34:16] Amen. Amen. And and and that God just
[1:34:20] wants to use our body to share his own
[1:34:22] word with somebody who's not saved. It's
[1:34:24] it's it's that simple.
[1:34:27] So, we have an eternal purpose to walk
[1:34:30] in. And let's just
[1:34:33] um
[1:34:35] let's begin to walk in it, I guess, if I
[1:34:38] could say it like this, with a with a
[1:34:40] purpose. you know, uh, a as we leave
[1:34:43] here, as we go on our next week, that
[1:34:45] this message would not fall to the side,
[1:34:48] but that we would think about it and
[1:34:50] begin to ask God, Lord, show me more of
[1:34:52] your purpose. Show me more of your
[1:34:53] purpose. Fill me with more of your
[1:34:55] spirit. Amen.
[1:34:57] &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's sing that little chorus.
[1:34:58] Teach us to number our days.
[1:35:02] [Music]
[1:35:07] Teach us to number
[1:35:11] our day.
[1:35:15] Teach me to number our day
[1:35:21] [Music]
[1:35:23] that we may apply
[1:35:27] our hearts on to wisdom. Lord, teach us
[1:35:32] to number our days.
[1:35:39] Teach us to number our days.
[1:35:46] Oh, teach us to number our days
[1:35:53] that we may apply
[1:35:57] our hearts on to wisdom. Lord, teach us
[1:36:03] to number our days.
[1:36:08] Oh, teach us to number our days.
[1:36:16] Teach us to number our days
[1:36:23] that we may apply our hearts on to
[1:36:29] wisdom. Lord, teach us to number our
[1:36:34] days.
[1:36:38] Imagine any one of us here knew how many
[1:36:42] days we had
[1:36:46] no I don't care what the number is
[1:36:49] knowing that number would put us in a
[1:36:52] position
[1:36:55] to apply our hearts unto wisdom
[1:36:58] &gt;&gt; to make the best of our life and to
[1:37:01] fulfill
[1:37:04] how many's how many's um actually in
[1:37:07] your lifetime has put money in a bank or
[1:37:10] a CD or something for retirement
[1:37:13] Keep your hands up for a second. Okay,
[1:37:18] you better be thinking about it.
[1:37:21] Okay. And why do we do that?
[1:37:25] We do that because we want something for
[1:37:27] the future.
[1:37:30] &gt;&gt; We want something for when we're done
[1:37:32] working, we have something to live on.
[1:37:36] Well, we want something on the other
[1:37:38] side. Amen.
[1:37:39] &gt;&gt; That on the other side is put in down
[1:37:43] here when we're working on something
[1:37:46] eternal.
[1:37:47] &gt;&gt; It's not working on the natural, but
[1:37:49] it's working on the eternal. Amen. Let's
[1:37:52] sing that little course. Learning to
[1:37:54] lean. Learning to lean on Jesus.
[1:37:59] Learning
[1:38:01] to lean.
[1:38:03] I'm learning
[1:38:06] to lean.
[1:38:08] I'm learning to lean on Jesus.
[1:38:14] [Music]
[1:38:16] Gaining
[1:38:18] more power
[1:38:20] than I've ever seen.
[1:38:24] I'm learning to lean
[1:38:27] on Jesus.
[1:38:31] Oh, learning
[1:38:33] to lean. I'm learning
[1:38:37] to lean.
[1:38:39] I'm learning to lean on Jesus.
[1:38:47] Gaining
[1:38:49] more power
[1:38:51] than I've ever seen.
[1:38:54] I'm learning to lean on Jesus.
[1:39:03] Let go and let God have his wonderful
[1:39:10] way.
[1:39:12] Let go and let God have his way.
[1:39:20] Your sorrow will vanish. Your night turn
[1:39:26] to day. Let go and let God have his way.
[1:39:33] [Music]
[1:39:35] Let go and let God have his wonderful
[1:39:41] way. Let go and let God have his way.
[1:39:50] Your sorrows will vanish. Your night
[1:39:55] turn to day. Let go and let God have his
