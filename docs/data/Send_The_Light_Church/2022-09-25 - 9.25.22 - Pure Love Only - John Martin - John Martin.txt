decision I drove my steak down and I'm going to serve the Lord regardless it doesn't matter how many times you fall uh even a righteous man falls not just once not just twice but no matter how many he just gets back up and he keeps going and we're thankful that God has provided a Grace and the blood to cover us love covers a multitude of sin that we can keep marching forward into the image of Jesus Christ amen amen God bless you let's stand together for the reading of the word and first John chapter 4 . we got a chance to talk with brother Burley he appreciates uh our prayers for him he had um mouth surgery a couple weeks ago and I know her sister Kathleen is going through some uh mouth work as well so let's continue to hold her up um but our sister Lynn had been asking about brother burley's eye and he's going to be having surgery October 31st so if we could remember him for that need amen amen amen first John chapter 4 we're going to read verse 7 verse 8 verse 16 and 17 and then have a word of Prayer amen beloved let us love one another for for love is of God and everyone that loveth is born of God and knoweth God he that loveth not knoweth not God for God is love and that's a very strong statement he that loveth not he doesn't really know God for God is love and drop down to verse 16. and we have known we have known and believed the love that God have to us God is love and he that dwelleth in love dwelleth in God and God in him herein is our love made perfect that we may have boldness in the day of judgment because as he is so are we in this world amen let's look to God In Prayer Heavenly Father we thank you Lord that you have provided for us a place to come Lord and hear from heaven and we know this is only possible by your grace you promise to be we're just two or three would be gathered together in your name and Lord we have dedicated this house in this place for the honor and the uplifting of the word of God and father we thank you that you have watched over your word all these years Lord that you wanted this word to be pure and without touched by man's hands that in this last age before you're coming away that we would have the perfect word of God and we thank you Lord that you have identified yourself as a god of not just of love but you are love and we thank you today that you put it within our power to know you to know that love and to have that love inside of us Lord we pray today that you would bless every brother and every sister that's here Lord there are needs questions things on their minds Lord we know that thou art able to meet every need for you hold the power of Heaven and Earth we ask today Lord that you would give us your Revelation concerning the love of God Lord we know it's unexhaustible but we just pray that you would bring us a little closer bring us a Little Closer to You Lord show us yourself a little bit more that we might know what we are to become for we commit ourselves in this service with every need now into your hands bring yourself glory and honor for we pray in Jesus Christ's name amen amen God bless you may be seated but Jesus said by this shall all men know that you're my disciples if you have love one for another love is the identifying factor of God for God is love and the manifestation of this same pure love and a human being is the identification that we're connected to God that we're following God that we're Disciples of God everyone that loveth is born of God and knoweth God knowing god is love knowing God is love job 36 verse 26 is behold God is great and we know him not neither can we number his years uh because uh you can't search him out right it says neither can the number of his Years be searched out Romans 11 33 says oh the depth of the riches both of wisdom and knowledge of God how unsearchable are his judgment and his ways past finding out for who can know the mind of the Lord Isaiah 53 verse 1 who have believed a report unto whom is the arm of the Lord revealed God is so great that we can't put him in a fishbowl and say there's God but yet God has not distant himself from his people because uh God has a desire of for his people to know him now the scriptures is really the only authentic thing that we have whereby we may be able to know God in a greater way I mean there's been a lot of books written about God and a lot of opinions and a lot of uh things that have been spoken but nothing gives us a more accurate comprehension of God than the Bible in first John chapter 2 verse 3 first John chapter 2 verse 3 says and hereby we do know him uh hereby we do know that we know him if we keep his commandments so how many people say they know God and they have not even a Pursuit Of Interest of keeping the Commandments amen it it you know so our feeling is gonna can tell us all the time that we know God we might have had experiences with God but does that really mean we know him he saith I know him and keepeth not his Commandments is a liar and the truth is not in him so how many times have you saw somebody and the world is full of people who do not keep the Commandments can you say Amen to that and so how many times have we talked to somebody who wasn't keeping the Commandments and said you're a liar you know that but the truth is that's what the Bible's saying verse 5 but whosoever keepeth his word in him verily is the love of God perfected and hereby knowing that we are in him he that saith he abideth in him ought himself also sold to walk even as he walks so it's it's pretty important for us to know how Jesus walked and again not what some book tells us how we walked or are even our mom our dad or even our pastor we need to note for ourselves how Jesus walked because replacing our soul on it replacing our soul on that the scripture tells us he that hates his brother or sister is blind and he don't even really know God properly God's love doesn't think ill or evil of anyone God is kind he's good he he suffers long with his people he Bears all things he endures all things with his people first Peter 3 20 tells us which sometimes were disobedient when Once the long suffering of God waited in the days of Noah while the ark was a preparing were in few that is only eight Souls were saved a hundred and twenty years of patience and long-suffering and it didn't change the people's mind right his love just doesn't quit it doesn't fail he doesn't get puffed up he doesn't vote with himself he doesn't get offended when we don't try when we when we don't when we don't press in when we don't keep his commandment he don't get offended thank you it's our choice God is humble he's meek when he manifested himself the Bible says there was no beauty that we should behold amen he didn't come wanting to look good on the outside he hid himself from the world he was born in a stable there wasn't much to look at from the outside he didn't pump iron as it were his reputation of an illegitimate birth followed him throughout his entire life one time Jesus asked Peter who does men say that I am and there was all sorts of answers given there wasn't no continuity to it right amen no different than today Jesus said many will come to me in that day and say Lord I thought because of this we run the same page but he never knew them they must have not really loved God I believe that God is still hiding himself today from the wise and The Prudent anybody that has the that attitude the wrong attitude he hides himself from that he he opens himself up to those that have a humble contrite of me God I need you in my life I'm not good enough I I can't stand on my merits I I'm naked without you I need you Lord now that who God is interested in today amen God is love his love is pure there's no additives there's no partiality there's no respect to persons there's there's nothing like that it's just unconditional love Titus 1 verse 15 says unto the pier the pure in heart for they shall see God Amen unto the pure all things are pure but unto them that are defiled and unbelieving is nothing pure but their mind and their conscience is defiled now look at this they profess that they know God but in Works they deny him being abominable and disobedient and unto every good worker reprobate so what are the works that we need to be doing to know that we know him I believe God wants us to know him to know that he is love I believe that God wants us to become established in that love Ephesians chapter 3 verse 17 says that Christ May dwell in your hearts by faith that being rooted and grounded in Doctrine no it's love may be able to comprehend it is that love that gives us comprehension with All Saints what is the breath the length the depth and the height and to know the love of Christ which passeth knowledge that we might be filled with the fullness of God it is the love of God that brings the fullness of God Amen a clear perception of God's love is manifested when we forfeit our own will to help other some other soul first John chapter 3 verse 16 declares hereby perceive we the love of God because he lay down his life for us we ought to lay down our lives for the brother and I know you know these scriptures but I'll tell you I know that I need to be reminded of them everybody I know that I want to see my life laid down more for others I don't think I'm at that Plateau that I've that I've attained a clear perception of God's love is seen when we keep his word whoso keepeth his word in him verily is the love of God perfected we know him if we keep his Commandments this is what the word says in John 13 34 a new commandment I give you that you love one another as I have loved you that ye also love one another and by this shall all men will unite disciples if you have love one to another oh my last service we talked to a little bit about Liberty and yes sometimes we don't have Liberty to do everything that we want to do but we are given so much Liberty to serve one another right we Master take advantage of that because that's scriptural to to love one another exactly the way that Jesus loves us I believe there's a yearning inside the seed of God that's that's Longing To Love more like God loves to manifest it to to see it come out of our Lives the Bible says the whole earth is groaning and waiting for a manifestation of God and I I the one thing the devil can't do is love unconditionally he is so selfish right it's all about him right amen yeah and every man that has this hope he's purifying himself he's reaching forth for pure love only I want to entitle this message pure love only I believe every born-again Christian can can relate to Paul when he said oh that I might know him more there was that that longing for for more of God 's love is absolutely pure it's not mixed with selfishness or greed there's no hidden agendas there's no ill intense there's no wrong motives involved there's no respect of persons of I like this one more than that one there are no wrong Surprises with the love of God 's love is so pure so powerful that it can suffer when it don't get its way it can bear it can endure it can forgive and and it's so powerful that a perfect setting in of love in heaven could not manifest it there was a part of God's love there that could never be manifest there was nothing to forgive there was nothing to endure there was nothing to heal there was nothing to redeem but God had a longing inside of him to express this pure love as a Healer as a comforter as an intercessor as a high priest right as a Jehovah Jireh that could Supply our needs when there was no need to supply my name he wanted to be a gracious and merciful father but this setting in heaven was too perfect to express the vastness of this love right God is love so he he allowed evil and perversion to evolve and he allowed man to slip away from a perfect pure setting in the garden he permitted man to to fail in order for God to be able to show the rest of who he is [Laughter] Ephesians 2 verse 4 says but God who is rich in Mercy for his great love we're with he loved us now we can know God differently than the angels I don't think he's healed any of the Angels I don't think they got sick they're not redeemed always remember love was the reason love was the reason what was the reason for every problem he wanted to show himself greater than the problem and I'll say today I don't it doesn't matter what your your problem is the manifestation of God's love can take care of it the manifestation of God's love can take care of it love is the reason I want you to place yourself in the scriptures here Deuteronomy chapter 7 verse 6 if you want to write it down the Bible says for thou art and holy people unto the Lord thy God the Lord thy God have not chosen thee to the Lord thy God have chosen thee to be a special people unto himself above all people that are on the face of the Earth the Lord did not set his love upon you nor Choose You because you were more in number than any people for you were the viewers of the people but because the Lord loved you amen just a pure love and because he would keep his word the oath which he sworn unto your fathers have the Lord brought you out of with a mighty hand and redeemed you out of the house of bondage from the hand of pharaoh king of Egypt the Lord did not set his love upon you and choose you because you were something special you weren't he didn't choose you because you were special but he chose you to be special him choosing you makes you special but you're not just special to do whatever you want to do special unto the Lord a special people unto him God has called you above everybody on the planet to be different than everybody else he's made you a special people too many Believers think God chose them because they were something special as if love wasn't his motive we don't want to get to a place like we're something special we need to realize that if we're special he made us special and he made a special for one purpose and it's to bring him glory and honor it's all about him it's never been about how we can just make ourselves something Jesus himself his own testimony of us there's none good there's none right not even one so the only he's the special one and he's God he can do what he wants to do and if he chose us we ought to Just Praise Him for choosing Us Praise Him give him on or give them glory and let them take our lives and use us as he would see fit but always remember that we're special because he made it special we don't want to take away from who we are we just don't want to make us something we're not foreign God loves us unconditionally with a pure love the Bible says that he don't even take pleasure in the death of the wicked there's just nothing in him that wants to see anybody get hurt I mean these people who decide that they don't want God that hurts God because they're turning down the only source of life and they've been so indoctrinated by the devil that they feel that they can just live their life on this Earth and not have to answer to anybody but not realizing that this life is just a vapor compared to Eternity [Music] amen God didn't make us a special people just for heaven he wants us to be special on this Earth he wants us to represent him on this planet First Peter chapter 2 verse 6. wherefore also it is contained in the scripture thank God for the scripture this morning behold I lay in Zion a Chief Cornerstone elect and precious and he that believeth on him shall not be confounded we know this is Jesus Christ the word and unto you therefore which believe he is precious but unto them which don't believe who are those they're the disobedient the stone which the builders disallowed the same is made the head of the corner and it's also a stone of stumbling and it's a rock of offense even to them which stumble at the Bible stumble at the word being disobedient where unto also they were appointed they were appointed but you are a chosen generation amen amen a royal priesthood a holy nation you are a peculiar people that you should show forth the Praises of him that have called you out of Darkness Into His Marvelous Light I hope you're not sitting here not wanting to Worship the Lord this morning because if you're chosen he has called you to bring forth Praises unto him personally which in times past here it is you were not a people you were not a special people but are now the people of God which have which had not obtained Mercy but now have obtained Mercy that should be enough to praise them we've been chosen to be a special people just for God to do what he wants us to do so brother John what does he want us to do just lay it out there just tell me what he wants me to do and I'll do it all right let's let's go to John chapter 15. I believe the Bible tells us that he wants us to love God back with our with all of ourselves and and the problem the problem that we the challenge that we have is since we were born with a a wrong nature to begin with that wrong nature was a selfish nature it was interested in only getting what it wants for its own reasons and motives and that thing has to die out in order for us to give all of our love to the Lord amen Jesus said if you love me keep my Commandments it wasn't like part-time it's even when we're not thinking about it Saint John 15 12. this is my commandment that you love one another not the way you think it should be done but as I have loved you and he has loved us so much that we we just wouldn't be here if it wasn't for his love but you know sometimes our love for somebody kind of boosts them out of our life I'm not loving them the way that God loves us we shouldn't want to boot anybody out [Music] we should just draw a bigger Circle bring them in well brother John you don't know what they did to me well you don't know what I did to Jesus we've all failed Jesus we've all let him down we've all turned we've all denied him at some time like Peter so who is anyone to say that I can boot somebody out so the Commandment it's the Commandment it's not a choice or an option I should say it's a Commandment that we love one another as as he has loved us and that's a that's a tall that's a tall order that's a tall order that's that's why we say Lord help me every day that's why we say Lord fill me with your spirit fill me with your love that I can manifest that I do know you because up here I know you Lord and sometimes I feel his presence and I know you Lord but the real proof comes in is when I love my brother and sister who when they do me wrong that's the real proof that I know him the acid test that's why Jesus said to this church Age come by of me go try it in the fire the real deity the real evidence that that you can love the unlovable Greater Love have no man than this that a man lay down his life for his friends and you are my friends remember your special people but you are my friends if you do whatsoever I command you henceforth I call you not servants for the servant no not what does Lord doeth but I have called you friends for all things that I've heard of my father I have made known unto you I'm so grateful that we go to a church where we're not hearing half of the word we're only here in part of the truth how are we going to make it to Heaven what part of the truth we need all the truth that's why we need a five-fold ministry that's why we need to get into those tapes you have not chosen me but I have chosen you and have ordained you that you should go and bring forth fruit and that your fruit shouldn't stop coming it should remain that whatsoever ye shall ask of the father in my name he'll give it to you that's what I'm saying we're talking about A Love Affair here and Love Will Conquer these things I command you that you love one another the emphasis is Love Is it because it's a subject it's because it's who God is God is love God wants our motive to be pure love as well do everything you do because of pure love he chose us from the beginning because he loved us and now today we love him back because he first loved us and he loved us knowing we were not good that means I must love those who I know are not good First Peter chapter 1 verse 2. says elect according to foreknowledge or selected or chosen to be a special people according to foreknowledge of God the Father through the process of sanctification of the spirit onto the obedience and the blood of Jesus Christ wow so we just can't be a special people and sit around do what we want to do that's exactly what the scripture is saying we have a part to play Romans 8 29 tells us what He selected as to to what kind of special people we're supposed to be unto himself the Bible says that God predestinated us to be conformed to the image of his son that he might be the firstborn amen many brother and so when he said to love others as I have loved you he's looking for the reproduction of himself to see himself reproduced the thing is we can't naturally carnally intellectually put that on we have to receive more of the Holy Ghost because the love of God is shut abroad in our heart by the Holy Ghost we need the life of God in us to live the life of God we can't live the life without the life it's impossible that'd be like trying to put peacock feathers in a crow just doesn't work it looks pretty from a distance but eventually you're going to see it's a crow first John chapter 3 verse 1. we've been chosen to be like him to make our reason and our motive for everything that we do pure love only first John chapter 3 verse 1 Be Love behold what manner of love the father has bestowed upon us that we should be called his son and his daughter therefore the world knoweth us not why doesn't it know us because it knew him not but we know we know how do we know because we love like him beloved now are we the sons of God and it does not yet appear what we shall be but we know that when he shall appear we shall be like him for we shall see him as he is every time we come to church we should see him a little bit better yes a little bit clear a little bit more it don't have to be game Busters but we need to see him a little bit more because he's in the unveiling of the word and every man that has this hope inside of him he purifies himself even as he is pure it's a continual process to where our love drops off a respect to persons drops off favorites drops off judgments drops off negativities drops off ill thoughts until we become just like Jesus now the Bible says we look through a glass directly but one day we're going to see pure love only amen Jeremiah 31 verse 3. says the Lord have appeared of old unto me saying now he didn't just place his love upon us and to let it go but he says yea I have loved thee with an everlasting love therefore with loving kindness have I drawn thee an everlasting love he has loved us with so nothing is going to separate us but we have to come in perfect harmony with the word with what he's calling us to do no man can can pluck us out of the father's hand nothing can separate us from the love of God but there's choices very hard choices we have to make every day the choice is to love him back with the same love that he loved us with and it's not easy to do God's love is so pure that there's nothing selfish in it he doesn't manipulate people because they don't agree with him we get up in the morning we want to go do something wrong he's not going to stop every time stop us every time he's not going to do that because it's our will and his will doesn't manipulate man's will now he's capable and he does deal with his sons and daughters like his own children certainly he does but his own children are not robots they're not manipulated by a manipulator he's a teacher but he's teaching us to surrender our will to his will it's only the goodness of God that draws man to repentance pure love of of God it is his goodness that that people see that make them want to surrender to God foreign doesn't just make you cry oh my it just you just cry you just Lord I yeah I'm sorry that I did this thing yeah but I'm so sorry I hurt you I'm I'm sorry that I haven't represented you the way that you've wanted me to It's A Love Affair Deuteronomy chapter 6 verse 4 and we got these hard choices to make and what are the hard choices it's to love God back with the same love he gave us and how do I how do I love God back I love God back I love loving brother James the same way that God loves me that's how I love God back I lay down my life for others that's how I love God back what you've done to the least of these my little ones these little ones you've done it on to me Deuteronomy 6 4 here o Israel the Lord our God is one Lord right he has said his his pure love upon us what do we do and thou shall love the Lord thy God with all thine heart with all thy soul and with all thy might now if I was to ask every one of you can you tell me that you do that all the time that places this all on the same page that places all of us on the same page that we need to press in to what God desires of us and these words which I command thee this day I command them get them in your heart they shall be in thine heart can I just keep them there no Thou shalt teach them diligently unto your children and talk of them when thou cities in thine house and when thou walkest by the way and when thou layest down and when thou riseth up talk about the love of God when's the last time you sat down and talked to your son or your daughter about God's love well brother John you don't understand find a way find a way to fulfill the scriptures the more that you can talk about God the love of God the more that God will become more real in your life he just happens to come where those brag about him amen and thou shall bind them for a sign upon thy hand and they shall be in the front lights between thine eyes and thou shall write them upon the pulse of the house and on thy Gates so when somebody comes in to your house you don't want them to say oh what a pretty house what a pretty yard you want them to say oh the Lord is beautiful the Lord is beautiful that's who you want them to see amen Deuteronomy chapter 30. verse 15. see I have set before thee this day life and good and death and Evil and that I command thee this day to love the Lord thy God to walk in his ways amen and to keep his Commandments his statues his judgments why do I got to do that brother John that thou mayest live and multiply and the Lord thy God shall bless thee in the land where thou goal is to possess it amen you know too many people have the idea that once they repent and get baptized they're automatically saved nothing's going to change that so what does it matter to do anything else and I'll say this is nothing that I'm putting on anybody that thinks those thoughts this is all comes from the devil I know where it comes from he has tried to convince people to lay back because the thing that the devil is scared of he's scared of the weakest Christian on his knees saying God I need you I need your love I need to be filled with your spirit I can't make it on my own he don't want to see that he'd rather see somebody that knows the scripture really good come in the church puffed up thinks there's something and can quote the scripture that's who the devil wants to see but he don't want to see some weak Christian calling on God at the altar he's scared of that think about where the power is at the power is not in US the power is in US you understand what I'm saying it's not in what we know it's in what we possess and the thing is the devil knows they that call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved the devil knows that if a weak Christian draws nigh to God God's going to draw an eye to him that's what makes the demons tremble it isn't us it's God moving in on the scene verse 17 but if thine heart turn away so that thou will not hear but shall be drawn away and worship other gods and serve them well this scripture is telling me that after I start out with God that I can turn away that I can I can be drawn away you know what makes this age the hardest age of all the ages there are more things in this age to entice our flesh and distract us than in any other age before us [Music] and I'll tell you the more that we indulge ourselves in those things the harder it is to love God the the more we just don't care about anything and we we develop that Spirit of of need of nothing and the devil tricks us that I got God nothing else matters and but that when we spend time too much time on things that are not him what are we actually doing we may not be saying oh YouTube oh YouTube or old movies but what are we doing when we're making those our head because we're spending time with that so much time those I'm trying to do here we don't got to close line but to close out and telling you what you can can't do what I am saying is put God first make sure he stays first because the devil sure got plenty enough to keep us away I denounce unto you this day that you shall surely perish and that ye shall not prolong your days your days upon the lamb whether they'll pass it over George to possess it right so I know this is the second time he's talked about possessing in other words we need to come to church understanding that we got land to possess I come here for a reason I come here to get more than what I got there's more of Christ for me he says I call Heaven and Earth to record all my money you know if you're going to get married you got to go to court you got to sign this thing you got to have people witness it there needs to be a document and here I call Heaven and Earth to record this day it's against us that I have set before you life and death blessing and cursing therefore choose life that both thou and thy seed may live it is brother sister it's not been our original decision to serve God that's not the issue that's never been the issue the issue is what are we doing every day what are we choosing every day because we are making a choice every day we get up that thou mayest love the Lord thy God and that thou mayest obey his voices that thou mayest cleave unto him for he is thy life and the length of thy days that thou mayest dwell in the land which thou the Lord sweared unto thy fathers to Abraham Isaac and to Jacob to give them you know most Christians are not pressed into the Promised Land but we need to be don't turn away don't get sidetracked cleave to the Lord our hearts can feel like we're serving God even when we're not I have found myself guilty of this more times probably than I certainly want to say but you'd need a calculator you know to be honest with you you need a calculator and the reason for this is Jeremiah 17 verse 9 says the heart is deceitful Above All Things is desperately wicked and who can know it and so for you to say I know my heart brother you're you're literally don't know what you're saying the only one that really knows is God and the word is a discerner of the thoughts and Tents of a heart that's why when we come to church we come to find out when God speaks to Something's bear and witness well that was for me that's the word speaking to us verse 10 says I the Lord search the heart I try the Reigns even to give every man according to his way and according to the fruit of his doings brother John that seems to be kind of negative no it doesn't just start praising the Lord start let your doings magnify the Lord just say Lord I want to walk in your way and be blessed be blessed for your doings he said behold I come quickly and my reward is with me to give every man according to his works it doesn't mean your works are evil all right but it should make us want to make sure that our works are pleasing to him amen amen pure love only must be our motive for choosing God it can't be to escape tell me you know mine started there it did and maybe a lot of peoples did but it can't remain there it needs to become a love affair choose to serve God because you love him because you love him only there's no other reason it should be the reason for mortifying the Deeds of your flesh for dying out to your will for loving not our lives unto death as the Bible says for esteeming others better than ourselves it it needs to be pure love only not because oh the Bible says the Bible is not do's and don'ts his Commandments are not Grievous we should just be so I can't wait to love I can't wait to do this for the right reason if our motive is anything less than pure love only I'm telling you we're going to be shaken away God doesn't want anything less in heaven but pure love only if you battle selfishness selfish motives about things I'm telling you this is the day to start shaking it off just Shake It Off to say I refuse this in my life I'm getting rid of this I'm not entertaining thoughts anymore Hebrews chapter 12 verse 25 says see that ye refuse not him that speaketh for if they escape not who refused him that spoke on Earth much more so not we escape if we turn away from him that speaketh from Heaven whose voice then shook the Earth but now he have promised he made this promise saying yet once more I shake not the Earth only but I'm shaking heaven there's a shaking coming and that's why our Focus must seriously be on pure love just get rid of anything else that is not pure love and this word yet once more signifying the removing of those things which are shaken as of the things that are made man-made man-made ideas are the devil made that those things which cannot be shaken May remain the word is going to shake off anything that's not pure God pure love that's why we want to get rid of it wherefore we receive in a kingdom which cannot be removed cannot be moved let us have Grace whereby we may serve God acceptably with reverence and godly fear reverence and godly fear for our God is a consuming fire I'll tell you if we focus on that there won't be any room for our flesh [Music] it's just when we take our eyes off of that it gives a chance for the enemy to get in there That's why nothing can separate us from the love of God because we have received the love of God into our hearts that's the kingdom of God it doesn't come with observation it doesn't come with knowledge it's a it the love of God is shed abroad in the Heart by the Holy Ghost and it's it's it's as real as God is real the thing that we got to learn to do is stay more in his presence waiting for more time just spending time calendar of the month waiting for God's love to come in our heart is not going to do it he's looking for Hunger for thirst for longing for calling for seeking for knocking for asking for drawing knife for for fasting for praying for crying out God is looking for us to do our part right but remember if he did it for somebody he'll do it for you yeah it's got to he's the same yesterday today and forever now Moses he chose to suffer the Affliction with the people of God than to enjoy the pleasures of sin for a season he made the hard choice to suffer and I'll say it like this when you choose to love unconditionally no side motives no negative no hidden agendas but when you make that decision I'm just going to love and forgive with all my heart you know you're making a hard choice it's the harder way it's suffering when somebody slaps you on the cheek and you got to turn your other cheek when our nature is just to get I'm going to go home and tell tell tell it's hard to do it God's way hard he chose to suffer every day not just once but every day the Affliction with the people of God than to enjoy I don't have to do that remember when the Lord spoke to brother Branham and he said these words because thou has chosen the Narrow Path the harder way thou has walked of thine own choosing thou has did this by thine own choosing thou has picked the correct and the precise decision wow the brother brother Batman God knows about precision he knows about millimeters and and and thousands and and tens of thousands thou has picked the correct and precise decision and it is my way and because of this momentous decision a huge part of Heaven it's waiting for you what a glorious decision thou has made he keeps bringing it back to the decision that brother Brandon made this in itself this decision in itself this in itself is that which will give and may come to pass that tremendous victory in love divine and then brother Branham could have chose to take part of the Gospel but he chose to take all the gospel he chose to love those that didn't truly love him that lied to his face that talk behind his back he chose to love them anyways and it was the harder way but it was the precise way the correct way and it is God's way and it will always be God's word it'll never change I don't care what they do to the Constitution I don't care what this world turns into a Sodom and Gomorrah God's word ain't changing God ain't changing love is the way when you choose to love the Lord with all of yourself you're choosing the harder way pure love only great peace have they that love thy law and nothing shall find them you ever get hurt offended bothered by something somebody did to you let me see your hands all right hum how how many does this happen to a lot okay honey doesn't want to be honest in this quiz the more you fall in love with the word the more you're falling in love with God Amen amen see the world loves God for what God does for them but like any any child when they get spanked I remember getting spanked by my dad and it hurt by the way and I was read so kind of give you an idea and I cried and when he left the room I didn't run out of the room and say Oh Daddy thank you for correcting me no correction is joyous but it did yield in obedience I just say it like this fall in love with the word great peace have they that love thy law and nothing shall offend them offenses are going to come people are going to bother you let them bounce off of you like a pinball because you're so in love with Jesus Christ that's all that matters so when brother Brandon he visits beyond the curtain of time he told us that nothing but perfect love is going to enter in he said whatever you do lay aside everything you got going in your life and pursue it if it be the will of God I want to talk about pursuing perfect love lay everything aside until you get it don't just stop living life and just sit here wait for it to come no stop spending time in so many areas of your life and spend more time saying God fill me with perfect love that's what that scripture that's what brother Brian I'm saying Jesus talked about this pure love in Matthew chapter 5. he challenged our human love verse 46 Matthew 5 46 and we're we're closing a very very you know today he says in verse 4 he says for if you love them which love you what reward have you don't even Republicans the same if you salute your brother and your favorite brother's only what do you more than others do not even the public and so so he's challenging human love any love that's with that is with respect of persons is not heaven material I don't think God wants anybody in heaven that's going to shake hands with this person this person this person I got a problem with that one foreign well brother John I don't think I have to worry about that because you know when I die God's got that all taken care of and he's going to make sure that all that's the way it is in heaven no character is built here it's not a gift it will be a victory you will have a choice you can choose life or death and choosy life is harder it's a straight and narrow it's harder to to turn the cheek into love but he says in verse 48 he says if if this is what the kind of love you have it be ye therefore perfect even as your father which is in heaven is perfect don't stay here go on to perfect love go on to pure love only amen and he talks about that verse 44 and 45 44 says but I say unto you love your enemy bless them that curse you do something good for somebody that hates you [Music] pray for them that use you not just use you but they know it and you know it they're using you over and over again despitefully you know you can still love them no it's not you got in you you become one with God you agree with God and it's not just oh God help them not to use me God get that Spirit off of them so they can be just like you foreign it's a love that you have Amen to see Christ in them pray for them which despitefully use you and persecute you do you know anybody like that that ye may be the children of your father which is in heaven for he maketh the son to rise on the evil and the good and he sends the Reign on the just and the unjust pure love only love is the reason to get this what Jesus is calling us to get it won't be a gift it will not come by automatically coming to church there is no church that you can go to Faithfully to automatically get perfect love there isn't it it doesn't come with natural the sacrifice of it I'm just going to go to church and somehow I'm going to be like Jesus no It's A Love Affair it's God speaking to your heart about what he wants you to start working on and it means something to you when you leave church that you actually start going to work on it and you get blessed for it and then you come back Lord I'm here reporting for Duty well what would you have your servant do what's next Lord let's Stand Together pure love only a scripture allowed services for bothering you have been called unto Liberty only used not Liberty for an occasion for the flesh but by love serve one another see in other words you got a choice what you do with your Liberty pure love only is just serve serve others with the raw motives you mix things and this is such a mixing age and to think that I haven't separated enough I'm going to be honest with you I have not separated enough God is calling us all to separate to its pure love only and I'll tell you it's a it's a it's an honor to be called to be his special people to be a people unto himself not partial but but all the way amen let's bow our hearts in a word of Prayer and maybe we can just seen that that little play that song the love of God the love of God how how rich and pure how measureless and strong foreign we look at God one who has never failed not one time he can't fail he's God and God looks at us his special people calling us to be like him it seems almost inter impossible to become but God is not looking at our failures our mistakes he's looking at the desire that we have in our heart and I'll say today if you have that desire in your heart and you really really want to love only with pure love towards everybody I want you just to lift that before the Lord lift your hand before the Lord with every eye closed every head bow God sees your your desire see that's what God is looking at believe all things are possible Lord Jesus we come to you with this simple message about love our hands lifted up towards our creator the one who created us from the dust of the Earth Lord we're not lifting ourselves up but Lord we're lifted our yearning in our desire to be like you Lord would you come and fill every one of us Lord with pure love Your Love Lord nothing short we don't want it mixed anymore with our thoughts and our ideas and whether we think somebody's worthy of it or not but Lord when you look down upon us at the end of the day we want you to see [Music] your son and your daughter who who reached out laid down their life to help somebody with a mode of a pure love lord it's our desire to to be that manifested child of God in this this age that you promised there would be a group of people a special people a chosen generation that you've called to manifest yourself again in this age the same yesterday today and forever Lord May there not be one person here who doesn't have the faith to believe and Lord May there not be one person here that doesn't manifest you Lord Jesus we commit ourselves to you Lord
