[18:38] [Music]
[18:43] hey men the love of God that writer had
[18:48] a revelation at least unknowing part of
[18:52] the love of God there's just and and
[18:55] Paul encourages us to know the
[18:56] boundaries of that love to to know the
[18:59] extent of it and in the sense that God
[19:01] has for those who who love him
[19:06] there is just no end to that love it is
[19:10] it is boundless and he gave us he proved
[19:13] his love as he gave his life for the
[19:16] world that they might be saved and what
[19:19] a shame it would be to not give our life
[19:22] back to the Lord Jesus Christ after what
[19:25] he's done for us
[19:26] hey man we're gonna take our prayer
[19:28] request up before the Lord and as most
[19:32] of you a number of requests have been
[19:34] given into the what's happened I like
[19:37] using that that for a way of
[19:40] communication that we might be know how
[19:43] to pray one for another and be
[19:44] encouraged one of another sister Linda
[19:48] had a request to pray for John Larson he
[19:52] had a stroke and it was a possible heart
[19:55] attack hadn't heard but he was in the
[19:58] hospital and he's needing Hump
[20:00] healing and and comfort so let's
[20:03] remember to pray for John Larson amen
[20:08] and I believe his his wife was Carmen
[20:11] and at that time it couldn't go in and
[20:15] be there and in the room as you know
[20:17] with the cove in nineteen so let's pray
[20:20] for both John and Carmen Larson let's
[20:23] also remember to pray for sister hope
[20:27] that Linda's been helping amen and then
[20:33] brother Larry had put a request in a
[20:37] little bit ago on the whatsapp to please
[20:39] pray for God to make himself known in
[20:42] the hearts of my wife and my daughters
[20:44] in such a wonderful request i if you
[20:48] would just pray for all of our children
[20:52] who need to know the Lord in a way that
[20:56] he's life he's the only source of life
[20:59] and they need him there's no and let's
[21:02] just pray for one another's children and
[21:03] our loved ones amen
[21:06] brother Roger talked to him yesterday
[21:09] and he wanted us to remember once again
[21:12] his dad please don't stop praying for
[21:15] his dad his bedroom cancer but also
[21:19] feeling that this is the end maybe just
[21:23] battling giving up and just moving on
[21:28] with death and that such a horrible
[21:31] thing to - - to be battling in your mind
[21:35] so let's just pray that God reveals
[21:38] himself to him above everything that
[21:41] you'd have salvation and just know him
[21:44] as as the Lord and and as healer amen
[21:48] because God is he's he is a healer and
[21:51] he's still able he hasn't lost any
[21:54] powering then we as you know brother Ron
[22:00] clayton oneness - remember brother Bruce
[22:02] and prayer with the complications and we
[22:04] heard a good report from brother Bruce
[22:07] today that he's every day is just
[22:10] getting better and better he's he's up
[22:12] and about and able to do some driving
[22:14] just hard for him to to get up and Lord
[22:18] knows exactly the scent of the damage
[22:20] and what has transpired but we know God
[22:24] is he's a restorer a man and he's
[22:28] obviously working on brother Bruce real
[22:30] well let's continue to to pray for him
[22:33] as we give thanks to the Lord for what
[22:35] he's doing what he's done for brother
[22:36] Bruce men sister Kathleen had a number
[22:41] of requests and if we could remember to
[22:43] pray for her friend Joel palaces new

[22:49] I believe that's high pronounced and if
[22:53] it's not please forgive me sister
[22:54] Kathleen with gastric reflux problems
[22:57] causing breathing issues so let's
[23:00] remember that new grandson also for
[23:04] Cathy French
[23:05] with pancreatic cancer she's been in and
[23:10] out of the hospital a few times the last
[23:12] couple weeks let's just pray that God
[23:16] would intervene in their behalf she's
[23:18] been on the vent the ventilator and just
[23:22] needs a real miracle from the Lord if we
[23:25] could remember to pray for Karen in Brad
[23:29] Merrick they're Christians and they're
[23:32] asking for prayer there they're having a
[23:36] baby boy on June 17 if it would be that
[23:40] time and maybe it's it's set today to be
[23:45] that way
[23:46] but that baby has a serious heart defect
[23:50] and needs immediate surgery after the
[23:54] bird is going right in and have surgery
[23:55] so that is a real critical situation if
[23:59] we could remember Karen and Brad Merrick
[24:03] and their little baby and June 17th also
[24:08] Citra Kathleen's niece Colleen and her
[24:11] husband Dan are asking for prayer
[24:14] they're having a baby girl and it has
[24:17] possible heart problems as well and
[24:20] Colleen is a anxious and of course
[24:23] anyone would be battling that at this
[24:26] time let's pray for her that God would
[24:29] just give her peace and trust that God
[24:33] will work in His grace and her behalf
[24:38] and that God would just give her a safe
[24:40] delivery and the baby would be well and
[24:43] healthy and also they requested prayer
[24:45] to draw close to Jesus we could remember
[24:50] that request as well also we want to
[24:53] continue to pray for brother Marty's
[24:54] sister Kathleen's brother-in-law Andy
[24:57] for a full recovery from his lung
[24:59] problems that he's been suffering with
[25:01] and that Andy and marine would both
[25:05] receive salvation and and come to know

[29:14] you Lord labor of love Lord and I
[29:16] believe we got a reward emoji is because
[29:18] your word says you will if I always want
[29:20] to just grant the service into your
[29:22] hands Lord Jesus this touchy so I forgot
[29:24] a request Lord please forgive me Lord
[29:26] you know each and every question I pray
[29:28] you answer on the Lord and your time
[29:30] Lord Jesus just have your way this
[29:32] beautiful day Lord Jesus and we just
[29:34] want to give you preeminence Lord and we
[29:35] thank you once again flooding this
[29:37] gather in your name it's blessed a word
[29:38] to our hearts Lord to our minds or our
[29:40] bodies Jesus Christ am I pretty
[29:42] amen praise the Lord thank you for the
[29:45] mark and we just got a little distracted
[29:48] there fret to remember to pray for our
[29:51] missionaries and our brother just
[29:54] brought those before the Lord and we
[29:57] appreciate that we never want to forget
[29:58] God's missionaries that are laboring for
[30:01] his eternal purpose amen we wanted to
[30:04] also announce that a week from today
[30:07] we're going to be gathering at the
[30:10] church and having our first service
[30:12] there since we've shut down and I think
[30:16] it was my wife that sent you this little
[30:20] little thing here it says Trump
[30:22] announced that the house of worship are
[30:24] essential calls on the governor to open
[30:27] them up and I just want to say amen to
[30:30] that I believe that the house of worship
[30:33] is essential amen
[30:37] and and I don't believe in tempting the
[30:39] Lord to believe in use and wisdom but
[30:42] you can take anything out of balance and
[30:45] too far because I don't know how many
[30:48] sick people that went to brother
[30:49] branham's meetings they didn't go
[30:51] anywhere else but they just if they
[30:53] could just meet and they would go across
[30:54] the country you know looking for healing
[30:57] so there's a there's truly a balance
[31:01] there and but let's be in in prayer
[31:04] bring your mask with you if you're gonna
[31:08] wear a mask you want to bring your mess
[31:09] with you into the service anyways but
[31:14] we'll try to have some there's we made
[31:16] mention just in case you wanted to have
[31:18] a mask but not everybody's going to be
[31:22] using a mask and we're gonna be having
[31:25] brother Roger help us in trying to keep
[31:28] things clean and through the services
[31:32] and seaton us and in good distances with
[31:36] with one another just the best we can
[31:38] and knowing that everybody's going to be
[31:40] able to gather together but I want to
[31:43] make it available for those that can and
[31:45] desire to so let's remember that so this
[31:49] will be really our last hour less
[31:50] service here I never thought about it
[31:53] like that I'm kind of going to miss it
[31:54] because
[31:56] you know if when they forget things you
[32:01] know when I get to church like I can

[35:21] Saint Matthew chapter 10 st. Matthew
[35:26] chapter 10 and a great quote today that
[35:32] we have a chance to gather together in
[35:34] the name of the Lord and just being
[35:40] gathered together in his name he
[35:42] promised to be there in the midst
[35:43] it's called church and we're all having
[35:47] church in our homes but it's by the one
[35:51] spirit that unites us together and that
[35:55] were able to have church in the spirit
[35:58] of God amen and the spirit of his love
[36:01] amen before we begin reading there let's
[36:03] just ask God's blessings on this part of
[36:06] the service how many father we thank you
[36:08] for your precious word today that we can
[36:12] have it as a sword to prevail and to
[36:22] overcome and to be victorious in a walk
[36:27] with you Lord know the enemy he's not
[36:31] going to just give up and lay down but
[36:35] we've got about to take the Word of God
[36:38] and claim your promises and resist the
[36:41] enemy no God we just pray at this time
[36:44] that you were to bless and anoint your
[36:46] word to our hearts and give us precious
[36:50] precious precious revelation of your
[36:53] word today Lord we're depending on that
[36:55] we're not leaning to our understanding
[36:57] Lord but we're leaning upon the
[36:59] revelation of God we're trusting you for
[37:01] it today as we commit this part of the
[37:03] service and ask your blessings on four
[37:06] heart and life in Jesus Christ's name we
[37:08] pray amen amen
[37:11] may Matthew chapter 10 verse number 29
[37:16] through 31 just three verses there are
[37:20] not two sparrows sold for a farling and
[37:23] one of them shall not fall on the ground
[37:27] without your father but the very hairs
[37:31] of your head are all numbered
[37:34] fear ye not therefore ye are more value
[37:38] than many sparrows amen god bless you
[37:42] may be seated
[37:48] god knows the situation knows the
[37:54] situation that we're living in knows
[37:57] what is trying to happen in our nation
[38:01] and we know the enemy is working in the
[38:06] minds of those that he can get in and
[38:10] use these situations for their gain
[38:14] causing confusion to help the world and
[38:19] i believe it would be the devil's job to
[38:23] try to get us distracted with those
[38:26] things see God knows the situation God
[38:31] knows your situation because you have a
[38:34] situation but God has the situation too
[38:37] and it would doesn't matter to the devil
[38:42] what our minds are preoccupied with in
[38:48] this world if the pandemic wasn't here
[38:51] it'd be something else and he's just
[38:53] trying to get us off of of what our mind
[38:58] should be on and which is the situation
[39:01] that's going on in heaven with God his
[39:03] purpose and what he wants us to be doing
[39:06] because whether it's a pandemic or we're
[39:08] just you know we're out enjoying life so
[39:12] good because we got to raise and the
[39:14] economy is really doing great it it what
[39:18] doesn't matter
[39:19] God is still moving forward with his
[39:21] purpose to get the rest of his family
[39:23] saved so we can get out of here and be
[39:26] together as a family so - God he still
[39:29] got one purpose amen now to the devil he
[39:34] just tried everything he an with every
[39:36] gun to get us so distracted but God
[39:39] knows the situation he knows all about
[39:42] it and we want to just maybe talk a
[39:45] little bit about trying to flatten the
[39:46] curve of fear as we're moving forward
[39:49] because as we gather together in
[39:51] churches and things open up I mean we've
[39:53] gonna be facing a lot of fear of who's
[39:57] you know is it possible that it's you
[40:00] know we could catch something and you
[40:02] know and we're and I'm sure we're gonna
[40:05] be dealing with this in the fall and the
[40:07] winter we just we just have to move
[40:08] forward with a greater faith amen and
[40:11] not have to have everything so perfect
[40:13] that we don't have to fear we have to
[40:15] face fear we have to look at it we have
[40:17] to say I'm a believer I'm trusting in
[40:20] the Lord and a moving forward now God
[40:22] knows every single thing he is
[40:26] omniscient he's he knows everything amen
[40:31] he is it means all-knowing God has
[40:35] complete infinite knowledge awareness
[40:38] and understanding he just he knows
[40:41] everything God is completely aware of
[40:44] each one of us and our situations he
[40:47] knows all about he knows what we're
[40:48] going through what we've been going
[40:50] through he keeps a running total of the
[40:54] hairs that are on her head I mean every
[40:56] time we call my or brush it we take a
[40:58] shower I mean hair leaves our body and
[41:01] so the number keeps decreasing but he
[41:08] knows the very numbers of our hair the
[41:11] hairs of our head they're very the Bible
[41:13] says Jesus said the very hairs of your
[41:15] head are all numbered think about that
[41:19] that's that's some amazing that God has
[41:24] that knowledge right there it is his
[41:25] fingertips at the end of each day he
[41:30] knows how many steps you've taken
[41:33] we've got little apps to kind of see how
[41:34] many steps we've taken we've got apps to
[41:36] see any calories we burn he knows how
[41:39] many calories we burn he knows how many
[41:41] calories we take in every day brother
[41:44] Branham said in the message things that
[41:47] are to be in December 5th 1965 he says
[41:50] everything was all pre-planned by God
[41:54] before the foundation of the world that
[41:57] you would be here the infinite God known
[42:00] and to be infinite he had to know every
[42:04] flea that ever would be in the earth and
[42:07] how many times it would bat its eye
[42:09] that's infinite see our little minds
[42:14] cannot fathom what infant means the
[42:19] infant God he known all thing therefore
[42:23] there's nothing out of cater all praise
[42:28] God you know what's in the world it
[42:30] sonicator right now to the nation it
[42:32] sonicator but with God in God's economy
[42:35] nothing is out of cater praise the Lord
[42:38] when God sent Moses with a stick into
[42:41] Egypt God already knew that his
[42:43] magicians Pharaoh's magicians were gonna
[42:46] play this trick and lay down their their
[42:49] their sticks and turn into snakes he
[42:51] already knew that it wasn't hid from him
[42:54] he knew exactly how many frogs were
[42:58] gonna be released
[42:59] how many fleas were how many lice and
[43:01] how many locusts is we're gonna he knew
[43:04] exactly the number of every one of them
[43:07] that released with those place he knew
[43:10] feral would harden his heart and not
[43:14] want to let the people go of course we
[43:17] know that that God hardened his heart
[43:19] but he just put it in it to be so
[43:23] gradient to what
[43:27] what didn't really belong to him amen
[43:29] and he didn't like the idea of just
[43:33] letting the people go things look like
[43:36] they're going haywire but there's really
[43:39] nothing out of cater God's got
[43:43] everything in control now God didn't
[43:45] tell mo
[43:47] everything that was gonna happen
[43:49] so he had a trust him to this time when
[43:52] things looked like they were getting out
[43:54] of control
[43:54] they weren't God knew about it and God
[43:58] had confidence in Moses that he could
[44:01] stand there and and and and be faithful
[44:04] trusting God and we got to do that same
[44:06] thing today the Bible declares that
[44:10] there's not one creature that is not
[44:12] manifest in the sight but all things are
[44:14] naked and open unto his eyes of him of
[44:18] whom we have to do and in fact Hebrews
[44:20] chapter 4 verse 12 tells us for the Word
[44:23] of God is quick and powerful and sharper
[44:26] than any two-edged sword piercing even
[44:30] to the dividing asunder of the soul and
[44:32] the spirit under the joints and the
[44:34] marrow and is a discerner of the
[44:37] thoughts and intents of the heart God
[44:41] knows everything he knows all about your
[44:46] situation today yet with all the
[44:50] knowledge that we have of God Satan can
[44:53] make us to feel like we're separated
[44:56] from God at times many times in life we
[45:00] can feel no one understands what we're
[45:03] going through maybe nobody cares why me
[45:09] Lord how could you allow this to happen
[45:13] why do I have to suffer like this why do
[45:16] I have to go through this what's going
[45:18] on can't others see my situation it's
[45:25] amazing with all the the assurance that
[45:28] I know God he knows everything but in
[45:30] the midst of all that we can still
[45:32] question and allow the enemy to make us
[45:36] feel like something's out of cater but
[45:42] God knows your situation he knows all
[45:44] about it we just have to learn to cast
[45:46] our cares upon him amen he cares for us
[45:49] because our infinite God does know
[45:52] everything before it ever even happens
[45:55] he's the only one that can use what
[45:59] Satan is through
[46:00] at us and rearrange it in such a way
[46:03] that it works out for our good Satan I
[46:08] can mean it as harm people can mean it
[46:11] as harm but you know God just gets there
[46:13] and makes it work out for the good amen
[46:15] romans 8:28 we wanted to just kind of
[46:18] look at this a little bit this morning
[46:20] if it be okay with you and we know that
[46:22] all things work together for good to
[46:24] them that love God and to them who are
[46:26] the called according to his purpose he
[46:31] is able to rearrange every situation in
[46:34] your life and make it work out for your
[46:36] good now only God can do that see when
[46:41] God created man in His image God had a
[46:44] purpose in his mind to express to
[46:47] himself to that man he created man in
[46:52] His image and he wanted man to be in his
[46:55] image but yet there were certain
[47:02] attributes as we know so he allowed that
[47:04] fall to take place so that God could
[47:09] express himself in family matters
[47:13] because God as I said is a family man
[47:17] and he wanted to express himself as a
[47:21] father to his sons and daughters to you
[47:24] and me he wanted to express himself as a
[47:27] husband to his wife you and me see what
[47:31] I'm saying he wanted that both of those
[47:34] expressions to be felt by us God wanted
[47:40] to express himself to let us know that
[47:45] he loves us he wants to cover us amen
[47:52] love covers a multitude of sin he wanted
[47:55] to express himself as a healer to us as
[47:59] a redeemer as a savior he wanted to
[48:01] express those things to us these great
[48:04] attributes so he created man in His
[48:08] image and he wants man to be in his
[48:11] image now and God has never strayed
[48:14] from his purpose yet to have his sons
[48:18] and daughters in that same image his
[48:20] wife in that same image you may have
[48:23] already been saved but there's other
[48:26] other things other attributes that God
[48:30] wants to express to you maybe to express
[48:33] his wisdom and you to express a greater
[48:37] faith in you did suppress his spirit to
[48:40] express his healing there's certain
[48:42] things that God wants to express in you
[48:45] because he wants you in His image amen
[48:47] but there's people that are outside of
[48:50] the realms of knowing God in the way
[48:53] that we know him and God wants to
[48:56] express himself in the way of salvation
[48:59] to them in them and it's part of his
[49:02] eternal purpose so God has never strayed
[49:05] normally ever stray from his eternal
[49:07] purpose that visions 3 expresses the
[49:11] desire that God has to make all men see
[49:13] what is the fellowship of the mystery is
[49:17] and in verse number 9 Ephesians chapter
[49:19] 3 the Bible says that it was hid from it
[49:24] was hid in God from the beginning of the
[49:26] world so God didn't really make this
[49:29] known at the beginning this this thought
[49:31] process of expressing all these
[49:36] attributes that he had in in man and and
[49:42] bringing man from Satan's Eden back into
[49:46] his image verse number 10 to the intent
[49:50] that now unto the powers and heavenly
[49:53] places
[49:54] this mystery might be made known by the
[49:57] church a man who's who's making it known
[50:00] by the church the manifold wisdom of God
[50:05] amen
[50:06] according to his to the eternal purpose
[50:13] not our purpose not what we got going
[50:17] not what we want to build but according
[50:20] to the eternal purpose which he purposed
[50:22] in Christ Jesus our Lord amen
[50:27] is God God lost a third of the angels in
[50:32] heaven God wants to fill heaven up with
[50:38] his family he wants his sons his
[50:42] daughters he wants his wife there he
[50:44] wants only in heaven what belongs to him
[50:49] amen that all encouraged us this morning
[50:52] Ephesians chapter 1 verse 11 by God's
[50:55] infinite knowledge and endless wisdom we
[50:59] have been predestinated according to the
[51:03] purpose of him who worketh all things
[51:06] after the counsel of his own will
[51:10] nothing God is not going to sit back and
[51:14] let anybody control his will God is in
[51:21] control God is going to fulfill his will
[51:27] his word will not return void it will
[51:30] accomplish that which it was spoken for
[51:32] and that's why when God has spoke his
[51:35] word to you I'll think about all the
[51:36] things that God spoke to you we need to
[51:38] be confident this very thing that he
[51:40] would have begun a good work in you he
[51:42] will perform it unto the day of Jesus
[51:44] Christ and as long as we're growing in
[51:48] God's love loving him with all of our
[51:52] heart with all of our soul with all of
[51:53] our might with all of our mind with all
[51:55] that we have as long as we're working
[51:58] for God's eternal purpose and that is to
[52:01] get all his family together well we know
[52:04] we have a revelation we know it all
[52:07] things work together for the good to
[52:09] them that are called according to his
[52:12] purpose amen to them that love God amen
[52:17] to them who are the called according to
[52:19] his purpose I want to think about the
[52:21] scripture we can break it down into two
[52:24] ways that we've got to love God and
[52:26] we've got to be called according to his
[52:28] purpose or and what there's truth in it
[52:31] to look at it like that or we could look
[52:33] at it in the aspect of how what that
[52:37] love is being defined
[52:40] because you me remember brother answers
[52:42] we can love God every day and still miss
[52:44] it
[52:45] so it's a love that is it's an
[52:49] unconditional love and not a conditional
[52:51] love and that love has to be that we
[52:54] love God so much that we work we allow
[52:59] him to use us we're called to his
[53:03] eternal purpose amen and that's the
[53:06] deepness of that love and that's the
[53:08] same love that God have when he when he
[53:10] when he sent His only begotten Son to
[53:12] die on the cross for God so loved the
[53:14] world that He gave His only begotten Son
[53:16] and and when that love when we love God
[53:19] back with that same love that he loves
[53:21] was I'm telling you were called to his
[53:23] eternal purpose nothing nothing's gonna
[53:26] separate us and everything's gonna work
[53:28] out for our good amendments right praise
[53:30] the Lord we should never be satisfied
[53:33] with just being called of God many are
[53:39] called few are chosen
[53:43] we've got to be called to his purpose
[53:47] not just a salvation but called to his
[53:50] purpose chosen according to his eternal
[53:54] purpose amen praise the Lord
[53:57] perceive we the love of God first John
[54:03] don't you don't to go there him you can
[54:05] first John chapter 3 verse 16 if you
[54:08] want to write down Percy V the love of
[54:09] God a God loved us he laid down his life
[54:13] for us we ought to lay down our lives
[54:16] for the brother amen so if you want to
[54:21] perceive what kind of love we're talking
[54:22] about we're talking about that right
[54:24] there the love of God praise the Lord
[54:28] God is able to rearrange things to work
[54:33] out to our favor with that love where it
[54:37] benefits us spiritually may not benefit
[54:40] us physically we may not get what we
[54:42] want in fact we usually don't but I'm
[54:45] telling he's able to work everything out
[54:47] to our favor so we don't have anything
[54:49] to fear we need to flatten the curve
[54:54] flatten the the fear curve amen jesus
[54:58] said fear ye not therefore ye are more
[55:02] ye are of more value than many sparrows
[55:06] and God knows the sparrows that fall
[55:09] down which you know the only time we
[55:11] really think of of
[55:17] of a bird that falls or that dies is
[55:24] when we see a dead bird where we hit it
[55:27] with the car or it hits a window in our
[55:29] house and then it it dies and then we
[55:32] begin to think about the value of that
[55:36] life that burden but think about the
[55:39] billions and billions of birds that have
[55:43] died over the years the sparrows that
[55:44] have died and God knew every one of them
[55:48] we don't even think of it
[55:49] and if God could take if he knows that
[55:53] don't you think he knows your situation
[55:55] what you're going through what you're
[55:57] struggling with what you're bothered
[56:00] with what's let God work out everything
[56:03] you just focus on what you need to do
[56:06] which is love them with all your heart
[56:07] and be working according to his purpose
[56:09] and I'm telling you everything's gonna
[56:11] work out okay Luke chapter 12 verse 32
[56:16] jesus said fear not little fly for it is
[56:19] the father's good pleasure to give you
[56:21] the kingdom he's got his mind set on
[56:24] giving it to you amen oh boy you think
[56:28] about an inheritance he just just wanna
[56:33] holla get on he wants to share it
[56:35] remember at the very beginning he at the
[56:38] very beginning had these attributes he
[56:40] wanted to share them and then he is able
[56:43] to do it he's able to give you the
[56:46] kingdom he's able to bring you in his
[56:48] image
[56:48] amen we've been predestinated to it 2nd
[56:52] Corinthians chapter 9 verse 8 says and
[56:54] God is able to make all grace abound
[56:58] toward you that he always having all
[57:02] sufficiency in all things may abound to
[57:06] every good work
[57:07] so God is able he holds the power to
[57:11] make grace abound unto you
[57:15] amen because he knows everything he
[57:18] knows how to take this situation and and
[57:21] these these things that are going on and
[57:23] and and and make grace abound in your
[57:27] life so there's nothing to fear nothing
[57:29] to fear fear is of the devil fear has
[57:34] torment and Satan enjoys tormenting our
[57:38] minds with so many unknowns what about
[57:45] this what about that well what's gonna
[57:48] happen if that happens what's gonna
[57:50] happen to us if if if this happens and
[57:53] what about this and what about that
[57:56] Satan loves tormenting our minds with
[57:59] the unknown he's always trying to get us
[58:02] to have to answer him well we don't have
[58:04] to answer them the bride don't have to
[58:07] answer the devil and the bride don't
[58:10] need to know what's going on to to be
[58:13] able to not fear to be able to trust in
[58:16] God she trusts in her Heavenly Father
[58:19] and then she trusts in her husband
[58:22] there's nothing to fear we don't got to
[58:26] know our future to be able to trust in
[58:28] God it's a total separation God will put
[58:34] us through the test he will put us
[58:38] through the fiery furnace he may put us
[58:40] in the lion's den he may put us in the
[58:42] in the dungeon like he did Joseph he may
[58:45] put us in the garden where we have to
[58:48] say not my will but thy will be done
[58:50] we're gonna go through things we just
[58:54] gotta trust him praise God praise the
[58:59] Lord Jesus Christ 2nd Timothy chapter 1
[59:02] verse 7 very familiar scripture for God
[59:06] have not given us the spirit of fear but
[59:09] of power and of love and a sound mind
[59:13] there's two different spirits fears of
[59:18] the devil so anytime you begin
[59:21] you question because of fear what we
[59:27] should be doing is just resist that
[59:28] thing immediately
[59:29] don't try to answer it the devil is
[59:33] wanting you to answer it because number
[59:35] one you can't answer it God ain't gonna
[59:37] show you and tell you everything you're
[59:40] not some spiritual genius where you know
[59:42] everything God never won cheatin already
[59:45] never told Moses everything God want you
[59:49] to learn to trust him that's what he
[59:52] wants because when you do that you're
[59:54] expressing your love Amen you're
[59:57] expressing something to him that is very
[1:00:00] high very high that you're you trust him
[1:00:04] in the middle of the unknown because
[1:00:06] anybody can trust God when you know if I
[1:00:10] know that I'm never gonna run out of
[1:00:13] money I'm gonna have houses and boats
[1:00:17] and cars and many vacations and lots of
[1:00:21] money and if I wasn't being you'll need
[1:00:25] to trust but God has to put us through a
[1:00:29] bunch of stuff because the trial of our
[1:00:33] faith is much more precious than gold
[1:00:36] tried in the fire made much more
[1:00:40] precious than gold we need to allow God
[1:00:49] to have his way with us he knows what
[1:00:53] he's doing
[1:00:54] that faith needs to be built to a place
[1:00:57] where we can come to a rapture in faith
[1:00:59] amen and that perfect love will bring
[1:01:06] such a perfect faith per rapture a mint
[1:01:10] love's got to be first you love God with
[1:01:13] everything you've got
[1:01:15] amen God's children don't operate by
[1:01:19] fear they operate by love that cast out
[1:01:22] all fear they operate by the power of
[1:01:26] faith that cast out all doubts they
[1:01:28] operate by the a sound mind that the
[1:01:31] devil can't use their mind for a
[1:01:34] playground
[1:01:35] a soundman you're in control because god
[1:01:40] you're using yourself to God you receive
[1:01:44] Jesus said you'll receive power after
[1:01:47] the Holy Ghost has come upon you
[1:01:49] well the power is the Holy Ghost it's
[1:01:52] the it's the let this mind that was in
[1:01:55] Christ being you it's okay to suffer the
[1:01:59] mind of Christ says it's okay to suffer
[1:02:01] I'm okay with that
[1:02:02] hey many for God have not given us the
[1:02:07] spirit of fear but of power and of love
[1:02:10] and of a sound mind you know we have
[1:02:15] heard that God carries us through
[1:02:17] difficult times we've all heard about
[1:02:21] those one set of footprints that's
[1:02:23] walking through the sand and to the
[1:02:27] carnal mind we're going through a hard
[1:02:30] time and we feel that God's just left us
[1:02:34] like why'd you make me walk that that's
[1:02:37] when I needed you the most in and in you
[1:02:40] were you just let me alone you let me
[1:02:41] feel alone and we'll come to find out
[1:02:44] that wasn't his footprints
[1:02:46] those were Jesus's footprints Jesus was
[1:02:50] carrying him and then through the
[1:02:51] difficult times Jesus carries us through
[1:02:54] the difficult times and the rest of time
[1:02:56] he's holding on he's holding us we have
[1:02:59] nothing to fear Saints nothing to fear
[1:03:02] dogs
[1:03:02] jesus said in Saint John chapter 10
[1:03:04] verse 28 and I give unto them eternal
[1:03:07] life and they shall never perish neither
[1:03:11] shall any man pluck them out of my hand
[1:03:16] amen you're hid with Christ and then no
[1:03:21] man can pluck can seize can snatch can
[1:03:26] force you to be taken away out of the
[1:03:30] hand of Jesus Christ amen no man is able
[1:03:34] to pluck them out of my hand he says
[1:03:37] that personally you're in my hand
[1:03:39] no man can pluck you out there's some
[1:03:42] security right there look at verse 29
[1:03:46] he's not talking about his hand in this
[1:03:48] one
[1:03:48] he says my father which gave them to me
[1:03:51] is greater than all and no man is able
[1:03:53] to pluck them out of my father's hand
[1:03:55] you talked about the grip hey man that's
[1:03:58] an iron grip it's like you're in Jesus's
[1:04:02] hand and then and the father's God
[1:04:05] you're just uh and that day you'll know
[1:04:07] that I mean I'm in you and you and me
[1:04:09] and the father and and you brought it
[1:04:12] together amen amen
[1:04:14] were protected amen were protected
[1:04:17] that's the thing that we got to
[1:04:19] understand were protected in the hand of
[1:04:21] Almighty God now that all flattened the
[1:04:24] curve of fear Satan can't get you
[1:04:30] because you're protected by the blood
[1:04:34] you're hiding in the blood the blood is
[1:04:37] covered you and Satan can't get to that
[1:04:41] blood cos if he got through that blood
[1:04:42] he'd be clean he can't go through there
[1:04:47] to get you it's the most powerful the
[1:04:51] most powerful thing that blood is what
[1:04:55] redeemed you that blood is what saved
[1:04:57] you that blood is what what he owes you
[1:05:00] amen God gave His life that we might be
[1:05:05] blessed with manifold blessings and
[1:05:10] loads us with benefits as as the Bible
[1:05:14] says amen Colossians 3 says your life is
[1:05:18] hid with Christ in God your life is hid
[1:05:23] with Christ in God amen Psalms 32 verse
[1:05:28] 7 thou art my hiding place thou shalt
[1:05:33] preserve me from trouble
[1:05:35] thou shalt come pass me about with songs
[1:05:38] of deliverance amen thou art my hiding
[1:05:42] place your hid in the hand of God and
[1:05:45] then praise the Lord it's a secret place
[1:05:48] of the Most High that Satan can't get to
[1:05:51] it
[1:05:51] he can't get to it nothing can get to
[1:05:55] you when you're under the blood of the
[1:05:57] omniscient God the all-knowing he's
[1:06:00] protecting you from every
[1:06:02] thing he is the almighty infinite God
[1:06:05] now that all be flattening the curve
[1:06:09] just a little bit should be increasing
[1:06:12] your faith it should be increasing your
[1:06:14] courage it should be increasing your
[1:06:16] boldness it should be stabilizing your
[1:06:19] current situation because God will help
[1:06:23] you no matter what we don't need to look
[1:06:27] to others for help that kind of makes
[1:06:31] God jealous anyways he wants you to look
[1:06:34] to him amen Hebrews chapter 13 verse 5
[1:06:38] let your conversation be without
[1:06:43] covetousness be without what let your
[1:06:47] life your behavior
[1:06:49] the words that you speak the life let it
[1:06:52] be without what and be content with such
[1:06:56] things as you have for he have said I
[1:07:00] will never leave you I will never
[1:07:03] forsake thee amen he is holding us in
[1:07:07] his hand he's not gonna leave it he's
[1:07:11] not gonna drop you and then he's not
[1:07:13] gonna leave you in that terrible
[1:07:14] situation the thing is he's faithful but
[1:07:22] as soon as you listen to the devil
[1:07:24] listen to what I'm gonna tell you as
[1:07:26] soon as you listen to the devil and you
[1:07:29] say yeah where is he at he must have
[1:07:33] left at that point your own confession
[1:07:37] your own confession because he acts upon
[1:07:42] the confession of your faith amen
[1:07:46] whatever you professed that's the way it
[1:07:48] is if you believe he's gone he can only
[1:07:55] act according to your faith just exactly
[1:07:58] maybe we could read that just pull that
[1:08:00] up for me and hebrews chapter 3 verse
[1:08:03] number 1 let's read that wherefore holy
[1:08:08] brethren partakers of the heavenly
[1:08:09] calling consider the Apostle and high
[1:08:11] priest of our profession
[1:08:18] what are you professing what's your
[1:08:22] profession let it be a positive one amen
[1:08:26] let it be a positive profession ah he
[1:08:30] said we should have boldness amen
[1:08:33] I will never leave thee I will never
[1:08:36] forsake thee Hebrews chapter 13 verse 6
[1:08:38] so that we may boldly say the Lord is my
[1:08:41] helper and I will not fear what man
[1:08:44] shall do unto me praise God for God has
[1:08:48] not given us the spirit of fear but
[1:08:50] power love and of a sound mind that we
[1:08:53] should have bonus the Lord is our helper
[1:08:56] there is no reason that we should be sad
[1:08:58] that her countenance should be fallen
[1:09:00] that we should be a talkerin under the
[1:09:05] spirit of what the devil is trying to do
[1:09:07] to this world trying to do to this
[1:09:09] nation amen we should be standing out
[1:09:13] like a sore thumb we're Christians God's
[1:09:17] got me in his hands
[1:09:19] I got bonus to say the Lord is my helper
[1:09:22] today I don't know where you stand but
[1:09:25] I'm standing with Jesus that's what we
[1:09:27] ought about to say when to everybody and
[1:09:29] everything everything that we come in
[1:09:32] contact I'll tell you if you want to
[1:09:33] give an answer to to The Devil's woes
[1:09:36] just tell them the Lord is my helper
[1:09:38] Amen I'm not going to fear what you or
[1:09:41] anybody does to me Amen when Jesus gave
[1:09:46] his trained disciples their final
[1:09:49] Commission in Matthew chapter 28 he said
[1:09:53] go and teach all nations in other words
[1:09:56] it's time to put into action what I've
[1:09:58] been training you with and now you think
[1:10:02] about a lot of times when we I you
[1:10:05] trained somebody you spend time with
[1:10:06] them and they go through something and
[1:10:09] they make mistakes and they want they
[1:10:12] want the glory for everything that you
[1:10:16] know God's doing it in their life and
[1:10:18] that's why when you you get a deacon you
[1:10:21] don't want some novice that's puffed up
[1:10:22] and just trying to look to get something
[1:10:25] out of it it's it's not us it's all
[1:10:27] about God
[1:10:28] and a lot of times you train somebody in
[1:10:32] you're training them they make a lot of
[1:10:33] mistakes and they fall well
[1:10:37] eventually they have to get to the place
[1:10:39] where you just let them go you let them
[1:10:41] go and this is exactly what Jesus was
[1:10:44] doing when he gave him the the
[1:10:46] Commission to go he out in verse number
[1:10:49] 20 he on Matthew chapter 28 verse 20
[1:10:52] teaching them go and teach all nations
[1:10:56] teaching the nations to observe all
[1:11:01] things whatsoever I have commanded you
[1:11:04] and long with you always even to the end
[1:11:08] of the world wow talk about the
[1:11:11] protection he's with you to the end of
[1:11:13] the world
[1:11:20] God knows all of our situations but he's
[1:11:25] still with us to the end they had to
[1:11:28] carry out the Commission to the end and
[1:11:33] he said I'll be with you to the end why
[1:11:35] was that so important because as soon as
[1:11:38] you begin to teach all nations
[1:11:40] everything that God has spoken to you
[1:11:43] because that's what he told right here
[1:11:45] as soon as you begin to do that
[1:11:47] persecution arise and people
[1:11:56] are gonna make you feel so odd they're
[1:12:02] gonna push you away they're not gonna
[1:12:04] want to talk to you they're not nothing
[1:12:06] to do with you they're gonna say things
[1:12:09] behind your back they're gonna make you
[1:12:12] talk negative at work about you
[1:12:16] negative stuffs gonna happen
[1:12:18] persecutions gonna happen but you know
[1:12:20] what Jesus said I'll never leave you
[1:12:23] I'll never forsake you I'll be with you
[1:12:25] to the end you keep preaching and then
[1:12:28] what I've told you in secret don't go
[1:12:31] preach it on the housetop let everybody
[1:12:32] know it ain't just for you friends you
[1:12:37] make everything so personal that as if
[1:12:40] it's just you and him what it's
[1:12:42] wonderful that he spoke it to you
[1:12:44] personally and there's certain things
[1:12:45] that only have to do with you I
[1:12:47] understand that but God isn't just
[1:12:49] interested in you
[1:12:51] he's not just interested in me I wake up
[1:12:54] every day knowing what uh how how low I
[1:12:57] am and how I'm just not capable of even
[1:13:01] functioning through the course of a day
[1:13:03] without the Lord Jesus Christ there's
[1:13:05] more to life than just us there's other
[1:13:08] brothers and sisters out there who we
[1:13:10] haven't even met and then and I want to
[1:13:13] spend eternity with them I know you do
[1:13:15] too we need to go out there and finish
[1:13:17] this race because he's called us to the
[1:13:19] Great Commission now the devil is
[1:13:23] continuously throwing fearful things in
[1:13:26] our faces and our minds to a lot of
[1:13:30] different avenues if it's not coming
[1:13:35] from one source it's coming from another
[1:13:37] source sometimes it seems like the is an
[1:13:40] army of devils and he's coming in like a
[1:13:42] flood but the Bible tells us that that
[1:13:44] God will raise up a standard he's just
[1:13:46] not gonna allow anything to happen to us
[1:13:49] amen that we can't bear he'll make a way
[1:13:52] for us amen
[1:13:53] I'm not saying he's not gonna let us
[1:13:55] fall because every parent has watched
[1:13:59] their children fall and there's nothing
[1:14:04] you can do about it because they're
[1:14:07] making choices and they have to make the
[1:14:09] wrong
[1:14:09] so they learned how to get back up and
[1:14:12] make the right choice
[1:14:13] that's Jimmy that's character it's part
[1:14:17] of life God allows us to follow praise
[1:14:21] Gandhi he gave us a remedy to get back
[1:14:26] up if a righteous man falls seven times
[1:14:28] seven times to get back up and then and
[1:14:32] if your brother
[1:14:33] Falls against you don't get the idea
[1:14:37] that all you need to do is forgive them
[1:14:39] seven times if you got the Spirit of God
[1:14:43] it'll be seven times seventy what do you
[1:14:45] mean brother John that's kind of hard
[1:14:46] yes it's hard even Peter said it's hard
[1:14:48] but here's the thing how many times do
[1:14:50] we sin against Jesus
[1:14:53] we think that part's okay God's gonna
[1:14:58] put us through the test just remember
[1:15:01] always remember what John Seddon
[1:15:04] for first John chapter four verse number
[1:15:06] four ye are of God little children and
[1:15:09] have overcome them the army of devils
[1:15:13] Amen them we say then that it was a boy
[1:15:17] it is it is it the Republicans as it's
[1:15:20] the Democrats is it is it is it who is
[1:15:23] them it seems like everywhere on the
[1:15:25] news everything that we're hearing
[1:15:26] everything worse is the devil trying to
[1:15:28] destroy everything ye are of God little
[1:15:32] children and have overcome them because
[1:15:35] greater is He that's in you than he
[1:15:39] that's in the world isn't it amazing how
[1:15:43] God can have you in the palm of his hand
[1:15:45] and he's also living inside of you he's
[1:15:49] inside he's outside he's leading by a
[1:15:53] pillar fire by a cloud by night a man or
[1:15:56] cloud by day praise the Lord
[1:16:00] I don't say everything's just perfect I
[1:16:03] know you're catching the spirit and
[1:16:04] that's the main thing Romans chapter 8
[1:16:10] verse number 28 the one who tried to get
[1:16:13] through this because if I give time I
[1:16:14] want to go back to our opening scripture
[1:16:17] so lord help us Romans chapter 8 verse
[1:16:21] 28
[1:16:23] wanna try to read this chapter here and
[1:16:25] and we know that all things work
[1:16:27] together for the good to them notice to
[1:16:29] them not just to you but to them that
[1:16:32] love God to them who are the called
[1:16:35] according to his purpose and what's his
[1:16:37] purpose his purpose is really being
[1:16:39] defined in verse 29 here and Foom for
[1:16:44] whom he did foreknow he also did
[1:16:46] predestinate to be conformed to the
[1:16:50] image of his son when God created man in
[1:16:54] His image that image was Jesus Christ
[1:16:56] and his purpose is to get us into that
[1:17:01] same image now it's not just us you're
[1:17:05] gonna see here that he might be the
[1:17:07] firstborn among many brethren now it's
[1:17:12] not right for me to only be thinking
[1:17:15] about myself and then brother brandon
[1:17:18] has made it real clear that i do not
[1:17:20] have the right to hear the gospel twice
[1:17:23] if somebody hasn't heard it once and i'm
[1:17:27] just think about what he's trying to
[1:17:29] express here because in this life it's
[1:17:32] all about you gather as much money as
[1:17:34] you can you gathering for retirement
[1:17:36] you're you're you you you you you're
[1:17:38] gathering to build your little our
[1:17:42] kingdom here but with God the way that
[1:17:49] you build your kingdom is you gather
[1:17:53] Jews
[1:17:55] you gather Jews and then you gather Jews
[1:17:58] for your crown because the Lord Jews you
[1:18:01] got the more you shine praise God it
[1:18:06] wasn't in my notes moreover whom he did
[1:18:08] predestinate them them I love that he
[1:18:13] also called and whom he called them he
[1:18:16] justified and whom he justified them he
[1:18:18] also glorified what shall we say to
[1:18:21] these things of God before me no if God
[1:18:25] be for us for all his brethren if God be
[1:18:29] for us who can be against us he that
[1:18:33] spared not his son but delivered
[1:18:36] him up for us ah yeah yeah that's right
[1:18:42] us not just me us all babies God we're
[1:18:47] family
[1:18:48] we're a family I've always loved a
[1:18:51] family something inside of me when I was
[1:18:53] in even in high school I just wanted a
[1:18:56] family there is this yearning and desire
[1:18:59] maybe it was cuz it was missing I don't
[1:19:02] know but I could certainly relate to her
[1:19:04] God wanted a family amen I just so much
[1:19:09] appreciate him this morning if God be
[1:19:12] for us who can be against us he that
[1:19:15] spared not his son but delivered him up
[1:19:16] for us all how shall he not with him
[1:19:19] also freely give us all things
[1:19:22] amen and he's able to make all grace
[1:19:24] abound to us who shall lay anything to
[1:19:27] the charge of God's elect again not one
[1:19:30] person but a bride amen it is God that
[1:19:34] justify it who is he that condemneth it
[1:19:36] really doesn't matter it really doesn't
[1:19:40] matter if they're just words
[1:19:42] right because the ultimate judge is God
[1:19:48] the ultimate judge is God and if you
[1:19:53] stand for him they'll stand for you if
[1:19:55] you take on his blood it doesn't matter
[1:20:00] what anybody's gonna say it is Christ
[1:20:03] that died gay Rather's risen again who's
[1:20:06] that even at the right hand of God who
[1:20:07] maketh intercession for us so he knows
[1:20:11] our situation he knows what we're going
[1:20:14] through
[1:20:15] he's interceding in our behalf amen who
[1:20:17] shall separate us from the love of
[1:20:19] Christ shall tribulation show distress
[1:20:22] persecution famine nakedness peril a
[1:20:24] sword
[1:20:25] who's gonna separate us Psalms 91 verse
[1:20:31] 14 and 15 just wanted to put this in
[1:20:34] here because he have set his love upon

[1:21:18] there are a couple of disciples that
[1:21:20] were walking on the road to demint
[1:21:22] Emmaus and you know the story after
[1:21:26] Jesus has suffered and died on the cross
[1:21:28] and when Jesus saw them he kind of came
[1:21:30] up to them and Luke chapter 24 verse 17
[1:21:35] and he said what manner of
[1:21:36] communications RVs that you have one to
[1:21:41] another as you walk and our sadness I
[1:21:43] want you to think about this question
[1:21:46] what manner of communications are these
[1:21:49] that you have one with another as you
[1:21:51] walk in her said God is interested in
[1:21:54] her conversations he's interested on
[1:21:57] whether they're full of faith or they're
[1:22:01] sad and they answered in Luke chapter 24
[1:22:07] verse 19 he said it was concerning Jesus
[1:22:11] of Nazareth which was a mighty prophet I
[1:22:15] mean a prophet mighty in deed and the
[1:22:19] word and word before God and all the
[1:22:24] people so they began to talk about this
[1:22:28] man Jesus in verse 20 and now the chief
[1:22:33] priests and the rulers delivered him to
[1:22:36] be condemned to death and have crucified
[1:22:39] Him and Jesus let them go on talking he
[1:22:45] let him go on and on talking about all
[1:22:48] their walls and finally he had enough he
[1:22:53] had enough of what they were saying
[1:22:55] their negativity they're there they're
[1:22:58] there they're questioning if it bothered
[1:23:03] Jesus
[1:23:05] and he answered them in verse number 25
[1:23:11] then he said unto them old fools and
[1:23:13] slow to heart to believe all that the
[1:23:17] prophets had spoken
[1:23:18] o not Christ to have suffered these
[1:23:23] things and generous glory that's the
[1:23:26] problem with most Christians they're
[1:23:29] slow to heart believing that they need
[1:23:31] to suffer they're looking for a gospel
[1:23:35] without suffering
[1:23:38] we're so to believe we have to suffer to
[1:23:41] bring about God's eternal purpose God
[1:23:44] Holanda suffering for no reason just as
[1:23:46] the only others my children see they
[1:23:48] suffer 19 and Friends you have to suffer
[1:23:51] to bring in the elective you have to
[1:23:53] suffer to get Jews in your crown you

[1:24:01] lunatic or some high ball you have to
[1:24:04] stand there and suffer to love them to
[1:24:06] bring them in to be part of the family
[1:24:09] praise God God has an eternal purpose we
[1:24:21] need to love him so much that we fulfill
[1:24:24] the purpose to not be slow I hope you

[1:24:33] love with in God that no suffering can
[1:24:38] separate him I hope you catch what I'm
[1:24:43] saying don't miss it
[1:24:45] verse 36 as is written for thy sake we
[1:24:51] you and I are killed all the day long we
[1:24:54] are accounted as sheep for the slaughter
[1:24:57] nay and all these things that we're
[1:25:01] going through all this suffering that we
[1:25:03] go through we are more than conquerors
[1:25:06] amen through him that loved us praise
[1:25:10] God

[1:25:40] said he likes to read Genesis it was
[1:25:43] really only a bruise on his heel it

[1:25:51] the Lord to bruise him amen it was only
[1:25:55] a bruise on the heel amen
[1:25:59] because he came forth out of that tomb
[1:26:02] amen amen
[1:26:05] and the suffering that we go through
[1:26:07] Amen I believe is Romans 8 says that the
[1:26:11] sufferings of this present time are not
[1:26:13] worthy to be compared with the glory
[1:26:16] that shall be revealed in US and then
[1:26:19] we're not afraid of suffering amen we
[1:26:22] don't have to worry because God is in
[1:26:25] control
[1:26:26] amen God is in control verse 39 nor
[1:26:31] height nor death nor any other creature
[1:26:34] shall be able to separate us from the
[1:26:39] love of God today I'm sorry let me read
[1:26:41] verse 38 for I am persuaded that neither
[1:26:44] death nor life nor angels nor
[1:26:47] principalities nor powers nor things
[1:26:49] present nor things to come nor height
[1:26:52] nor death nor any other creature shall
[1:26:55] be able to separate all of us from the
[1:27:01] love of God which is in Christ Jesus our
[1:27:04] Lord amen that's a great love that's a
[1:27:10] description of God's love receive II the
[1:27:13] love of God Christ lay down his life for
[1:27:16] us we ought to lay down our lives for
[1:27:18] the brother

[1:27:33] you've got god's word it needs to be
[1:27:38] quickened to you when you realize that
[1:27:40] you're suffering according to the will
[1:27:43] of God happy is he I mean happy is he
[1:27:46] there's just a revelation there there's
[1:27:49] no murmuring and complaining you notice
[1:27:51] Jesus didn't murder and complaint they
[1:27:53] meant lord help us
[1:27:56] if the omniscient God who knows
[1:28:00] everything about your situation and

[1:28:23] down your life constantly for the
[1:28:26] brother turn with me if you would tear
[1:28:30] opening scripture in Matthew chapter 10
[1:28:32] I want to start about verse 16 I want to
[1:28:35] try to go through a few of these now I
[1:28:39] want you to think about Cain for a
[1:28:41] minute minute a minute
[1:28:45] Cain did not value the brother
[1:28:55] in fact he devalued the brother it was
[1:29:04] all about him how he could get ahead he
[1:29:09] did not esteem others he did not esteem
[1:29:11] his brother better than himself even
[1:29:15] though he did better he did not lay down
[1:29:18] his life for his brother rather he
[1:29:23] devalued him made little and killed his
[1:29:27] influence he had no use think about this
[1:29:32] Cain had no use for Abel in his family
[1:29:40] now I don't know where you're standing
[1:29:43] today but God is interested in his
[1:29:46] family and we need to make sure that
[1:29:53] we're understanding the scriptures to
[1:29:56] understand his eternal purpose that we
[1:30:01] need to value those that are out there
[1:30:05] esteem them as part of the family of God
[1:30:08] yes we don't know who's who and you're
[1:30:11] gonna be talking right to Devils you
[1:30:13] don't know you talk to people were
[1:30:15] rejecting Christ we don't know but we
[1:30:17] need to say to everybody and we need to
[1:30:20] get in those that are his amen
[1:30:23] let's start here verse 16 brother and
[1:30:27] behold I send you forth as sheep in the
[1:30:32] midst of wolves isn't that the truth
[1:30:34] right about now on this age be therefore
[1:30:37] wisest serpent now harmless as doves but
[1:30:43] beware of men for they will deliver you
[1:30:46] up to counsels and they so scourge you
[1:30:48] in their synagogues and he shall be
[1:30:51] brought before governors and kings for
[1:30:54] my name for my sake for a testimony
[1:30:56] against them and the Gentiles but when
[1:31:00] they deliver you up take no thought or
[1:31:02] what you shall speak for it shall be
[1:31:06] given you in that same hour what you
[1:31:08] shall speak for it is not ye that speak
[1:31:12] but the Spirit of your father which
[1:31:15] speaketh in you you talking about being
[1:31:18] in the hand of God everything's gonna
[1:31:20] work out right you don't have to fright
[1:31:22] you don't have to fear God knows the
[1:31:24] situation before it happens and the
[1:31:27] father shall deliver up the brother to
[1:31:30] death and the father of the child and
[1:31:32] the children shall rise up against the
[1:31:33] parents and cause them to be put to
[1:31:36] death
[1:31:36] and he shall be hated of all men for my
[1:31:38] name's sake but the but he that endureth
[1:31:40] to the end the same shall be saved in
[1:31:42] other words don't stop preaching the
[1:31:45] word there don't stop but when they
[1:31:50] persecute you in this city flee into
[1:31:53] another

[1:31:57] not have gone over the cities of Israel
[1:31:59] to the Son of man cometh the disciple is
[1:32:02] not above the master nor the servant
[1:32:05] above his Lord it is not it is enough
[1:32:08] for the disciple that he be as his Lord
[1:32:12] and the servant as I'm sorry the
[1:32:15] disciple be as his master and the
[1:32:17] servant as his Lord if they have called
[1:32:22] the master of the house Beelzebub how
[1:32:25] much more shall they call them of his
[1:32:29] household think about it you don't want
[1:32:33] to get persecuted how much more of the
[1:32:37] household of Jesus Christ amen
[1:32:40] I'll trust that you're of God's house
[1:32:42] today amen
[1:32:44] fear them not hallelujah fear them not
[1:32:48] therefore for there is nothing covered
[1:32:51] that shall not be revealed and hid that
[1:32:55] shall not be made known what I tell you
[1:32:57] in darkness that speak in the light
[1:33:01] hallelujah and what you hear in the ear
[1:33:03] that preach ye upon the housetops in
[1:33:05] other words God's eternal purpose in all
[1:33:09] this is don't let suffering stand in the
[1:33:12] way of you preaching my word to the lost
[1:33:15] and fear not them which kill the body
[1:33:21] but are not able to kill the soul but
[1:33:24] rather fear him which is able to destroy
[1:33:27] both soul and body in hell are not two
[1:33:31] sparrows sold for a Farley and one of
[1:33:34] them shall not fall to the ground
[1:33:36] without your father knowing it but the
[1:33:38] very hairs of your head are all numbered
[1:33:41] fear ye not therefore ye are of more
[1:33:44] value than many of those sparrows that
[1:33:48] he knows that false whosoever therefore
[1:33:51] shall confess me before men him will I
[1:33:56] confess before my father which is in
[1:33:57] heaven notice he knows what you're going
[1:34:01] through in the midst of this suffering
[1:34:03] he knows he knows all this /
[1:34:07] execution he knows when you're trying to
[1:34:09] reach out and love somebody to Christ
[1:34:15] but you know what if you confess Jesus
[1:34:19] Christ before men then Jesus will
[1:34:23] confess you before the Father which is
[1:34:25] in heaven but if you choose to deny me
[1:34:31] before men him will I also deny before
[1:34:36] my father which is in heaven we have a
[1:34:39] choice if the suffering is too much and
[1:34:42] you don't want to suffer think not that
[1:34:45] I come to send peace on the earth I came
[1:34:50] not to send peace but a sword a man a
[1:34:53] sword the Word of God is a sword a man
[1:34:57] it cuts and it divides and it gets right
[1:35:00] to the intent of somebody when you're
[1:35:02] talking to somebody don't be surprised
[1:35:06] God uses you to help that person to see
[1:35:08] what's happening for I am NOT come for I
[1:35:12] am come I'm sorry I'm come to set a man
[1:35:14] at variance with his father and the
[1:35:18] daughter against his mother and the
[1:35:20] daughter-in-law against her
[1:35:21] mother-in-law and a man's foes shall be
[1:35:24] of his own household and he that loveth
[1:35:27] father more than father or mother or
[1:35:30] mother more than me is not worthy of me
[1:35:35] you're talking about love again remember
[1:35:38] all things work together for the good -
[1:35:41] then to love the Lord who are called
[1:35:44] them who are called according to his
[1:35:48] purpose well this is the purpose right
[1:35:52] here this is God's eternal purpose that
[1:35:54] were reading about he that loveth father
[1:35:59] or mother more than me is not worthy of
[1:36:01] me and he that loveth son or daughter
[1:36:03] more than me is not worthy of me and he
[1:36:05] that taketh not his cross and followeth
[1:36:07] after me is not worthy of me and he that
[1:36:09] findeth his life shall lose it and he
[1:36:11] that lose of his life for my sake shall
[1:36:13] find it see how of all these scriptures
[1:36:16] are coming together amen we've been
[1:36:18] studying so beautiful and

[1:36:24] sent me he that receiveth a prophet in
[1:36:26] the name of a prophet shall receive a
[1:36:28] Prophet's reward and he that receiveth
[1:36:30] the righteous man in the name of a
[1:36:31] righteous man shall receive a righteous
[1:36:33] man's reward and whosoever shall give to
[1:36:36] drink unto one of these little ones a
[1:36:41] cup of cold water only in the name of a
[1:36:47] disciple in other words don't try to get
[1:36:49] anything out of what you're doing for
[1:36:51] somebody don't try to get some sort of
[1:36:53] recognition give the coal a glass of
[1:36:58] cold water only in the name Lord I want
[1:37:03] to put that towards the end of this for
[1:37:05] the beginning okay that's all just God
[1:37:09] keeps track of everything amen
[1:37:11] verily I say unto you he shall in no
[1:37:14] wise lose his reward remember those
[1:37:16] Pharisees they wanted the reward of
[1:37:18] praise Amen everything that they they
[1:37:22] did they wanted recognition and praise
[1:37:25] and you know Jesus said hey if that's
[1:37:26] what you want that you got your reward
[1:37:29] but what you do for God you got to do it
[1:37:31] in secret in other words you here's how
[1:37:34] you do something for a secret it isn't
[1:37:36] that you're not in front of somebody
[1:37:37] doing it because people have to behold
[1:37:40] your good works but when you're doing it
[1:37:43] in front of others there is no thought
[1:37:44] about somebody seeing what you're doing
[1:37:47] that's how you do it in secret it's
[1:37:50] between you and God
[1:37:51] praise the Lord let's stand together God

[1:44:11] we're going through and when our love
[1:44:16] reaches to the place that it's actually
[1:44:21] called according to his purpose we began
[1:44:27] to set our love upon the saving of souls

[1:44:37] a greater measure
[1:44:44] tell you no no tribulation no

[1:45:05] purpose in the garden when he walked
[1:45:08] really when he carried his cross when he
[1:45:13] gave his very life for the purpose of
[1:45:15] the Father and the in the scheme of the

[1:46:07] when the last one comes in people need
[1:46:13] the Lord God is looking for someone who
[1:46:18] stayed there long enough that God could
[1:46:22] lay a burden on their heart a burden for
[1:46:27] someone someone who's willing to go out
[1:46:33] preach it on the housetop whatever God
