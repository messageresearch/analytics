dear friends of my grandparents who've now gone on to be the Lord my first Pastor as a as a boy it's a it's an honor to see you here amen I could have never thought that I'd ever be preaching to you about Johnson but it's good it's good to be with you all tonight and certainly I'm humbled to be here but I think we're all humbled and we come for his word aren't we let's go before the author this morning dear Lord Jesus we're just so grateful to be in the company of such precious Saints Lord is Brother John was testifying Lord it hadn't left we hadn't hardly left a building before it came to my heart I would want to come back and be with these Saints again Lord just doesn't seem to be enough to be a visitor but Lord I know that one day we won't be visitors one to another Lord certainly we're not in our family but there's one day where we're all going to dwell in the same house a place to be prepared for us but Lord tonight we come to our home in your word Lord and that's where we feel most home at Lord as we would come to this book I pray that you'd open the pages of it Lord and I pray you'd open each heart father I pray there would be Hearts doors that would be willing to heed your knocking and sup with you Lord and not just to wish you goodbye Lord at the end of the day but Lord there be little hearts and young lives even here that would say I want his abiding presence I want Jesus to stay with me when I put my head upon the pillow I want to know that I'm at peace with God and when I Rise up in the morning I I want to know that he's there and been singing Over Me All Night Long Lord may that be that kind of confidence between you and each believer here tonight I pray that there would be the one that would not believe tonight Lord I pray your heart would reach out to theirs Lord and call them to thyself in Jesus Christ name we commit this service to thee O Lord amen amen well we'll get straight to the word I would like to turn over to the book of Hosea chapter 11. in verse 1. just as we're turning there I'll I'll testify that we would have loved to have come up here sooner but the way it worked out it just seems that it uh it couldn't have been possibly any sooner the words the Lord's been establishing here tonight have been established in my heart these last few weeks and I'm very eager to share them tonight amen Hosea 11 verse 1 say Amen when you have it with me amen get her amen is all practice up right boys get them all fired up and ready to go how many have the word tonight amen amen there we go Hosea 11. first one when Israel was a child then I loved him and called my son out of Egypt may the Lord bless the Ring of his word let me be seated they think it's a funny thing that I would take only one verse for I'll say a context to my text tonight but we know that this this scripture here has a double physical or a double natural fulfillment out of Egypt have I called my son we know of course that that refers to Israel being down there in bondage in in Egypt but also later on in in the gospels we find out that had a double fulfillment in Christ out of Egypt have I called my son when Christ went down there as a little boy and he stayed in Egypt as Herod was trying to kill all the all the baby boys that were there around Bethlehem in the surrounding area and God hid him away in Egypt and he hid his people away in Egypt as slaves one day and I believe that he's hit his people away maybe it seemed would seem as to be in bondage and slavery to sin but there's a great Deliverance one day coming for his people and I believe that I'm I'm preaching to a people this evening that is a third fulfillment of this prophecy that there was there was an Egypt what we call a type of the world but God's called you out of that world Amen now you're no longer in Egypt God's called you out of slavery God's called you out of bondage amen but tonight if I could I'd like to take a text and and name the sermon if I could be so bold to say God's call upon your life amen God's call upon your life I think about Israel here the original fulfillment of this prophecy who was born under slavery and you can imagine how how it would be for a little boy or a little girl that was not just captured and put into slavery but they were born as a slave their father and their mother were slaves and all they ever knew was the the whip upon their back and they they got up in the morning they had to toil not because their mom and dad told them to do chores but because when they went outside if they didn't do what they were told they saw their mom and their dad whipped for not having productive children that it was that that they could see that they they were themselves responsible for their own mother and Dad's discomfort that they didn't produce and they didn't abide in the hand of the task Masters the the Egyptians and no doubt they got to an age when they were old enough to experience that whip themselves it wouldn't have been very long I don't suppose but to the task Masters figured well this boy five years old he is about time he figured out what a whip felt like getting motivated and that's all they ever knew the whip of a task master bondage of slavery I wonder if it kind of molded them into a box somewhere yeah yeah well they couldn't imagine what it would be like to be a free man uh studying the Histories on the way here and thinking about the all our own case of slavery here in the United States and the children that they study their social studies their histories they'll know what the Civil War was and that great Emancipation Proclamation that came forth and when Lincoln took home the victory for the North and what it meant for the the blacks and slavery but come to find out there was a portion of of those people that were in slavery in our own country that didn't know what Freedom was like and didn't know what to do with freedom the historians tell us there was about a 15 percent that stayed back with her Masters and said well I'll just abide here I'll just keep doing the same work I've always done because it was it was beyond the scope of their imagination what could I do with freedom and no doubt the southern slaves or former slaves could have gone to the north and found themselves a much more prosperous situation but they it was beyond the scope of their imagination there there was no vision the Bible says that where there is no vision the people will perish and there was no vision they said well what what would it matter if I stayed at this Plantation or went to the plantation next door over it's all the same work I'll just go ahead and stay here and do what I've always done and you find that there's Echoes of that same mentality in the Israelites because even when they're delivered by a mighty hand of a mighty God and he Parts the Red Sea and he he throws their captors there and they're they're out there on the other side of the Red Sea they see all their captors drowning in the Red Sea and they they give Rejoice but after that just like the blacks down there in the South they initially Rejoice but then they said what do we do now and the first trial that ever came to them in Israel they said well why don't we go back we don't have any water here in the desert let's go back to our task Masters in Egypt it would have been better for us if we had just gone back no vision no scope for the imagination they still saw themselves paid it into this box of being a Slave God called them the children of a promise God have had a vision for them that one day they would be the instruments of his grace Amen to project his grace and love for the world through a savior that would be brought forth through their people his special instrument they were God's chosen people but yet they had this this mentality that my I just can't imagine a life better than what I had back in Egypt can you imagine can you imagine wanting to go back to the whip of the Taskmaster because it was more comfortable because you didn't know what to do with freedom I wonder if there's anyone here tonight that could sympathize though that there's times in our Christian Journey that we don't know what to do with this Freedom they're they're When God says that there's nothing that's impossible for you that might overwhelm you you can say well I can't imagine what to do with that freedom but tonight I want to talk about God's call in your life and by God's word and by his Spirit tonight to reinvigorate your heart with God's vision for your life amen amen you know I I think about there's a a term called Stockholm syndrome today that people talk about and it's a coming from a 1973 event I believe in Stockholm Sweden where some bank robbers captured the people and held them hostage for a number of days and by time it was all over those people had created some kind of emotional attachment to their own captors and they wouldn't testify against them and they wouldn't cooperate with a police against them and they called it a Stockholm syndrome and we find that in in children that are abducted and and kept for years and years they they begin to have an emotional attachment to their captors and I I wonder if it could be said that there's people who are in bondage to slavery and bondage to spiritual sin today that would say I I don't even consider that any longer my Captor I consider it my lover or my friend my comforter forget about coddling Sin it's now sin that's coddling us but God doesn't see you that way no more than he saw the children of Israel as being slaves they may have saw themselves a slave and never been able to get themselves out of a slavery mindset but God had a different vision for their lives and no matter what the children of Israel saw themselves as it would not change what God would see them as Hallelujah and we see which Vision prevailed and now four thousand years down the road we can see that God had his way with his people amen but my would have been a much less Troublesome Journey that they had just believed on God's promises I think about how they they painted themselves into a box of slavery but God wanted to take them from the rags of Egypt to The Riches of the Promised Land and God wants to take us from a rag to riches you know the whole world loves to have a rag to riches story you know the man pulled himself up by his bootstraps and he'd done it and he he defeated all the odds he was born into a poor family brother John and you bring up this whole sob story and he he only had a mother and his father left him at a young age and and and then now look at him he he went to school and made something of himself and he he came out and worked and got himself a business and and just pull himself up by his bootstraps but God has a better story than that for you this evening don't don't get don't get lost chasing the worlds rags to Rich's story you've already got a rag to Rich's story you were found in the rags and the filthiness of your own righteousness or the best thing that you could do is say well I don't lie I don't steal I don't cheat and God said it's all as filthy rags to me that's all your righteousness but I've got my riches matter of fact I came down and dwelt in your filth I came down and wore Rags literally wore Rags for you what was interesting as the baby he was just dressed in the little Garment of a sweaty oxen a swaddling cloth wrapped around him literal Rags so that we could be partakers of his riches and his Mercy remember friends you're not chasing a rags to Rich's story you are a rags to riches story oh there's there's one the one who chases after you and plagues your mind tonight that Old Devil the Leviathan he's the he's the ultimate riches to rag story and you can remind him of that every time he says well go chase your riches in life you can come I've already got the riches Satan you the riches that you made the Grand mistake of leaving behind when you lifted yourself up in Pride and said as the son of the morning I'll be like the most high God and there was his fall amen when he made himself as God or try to that's where he fell and lost his riches and is now in his Rags there in hell but be careful friends how you define what your riches are because it will shape the view of your story and your identity Christ said that wheresoever are man's riches his treasure is there his heart will be also I have the first question for you tonight is where is your heart tonight amen is your heart tied up in popularity and what the kids at school think of you and what the boss has for you at work and the next promotion and the next house that you can find on Zillow or the next truck that you can find on AutoTrader or where is your riches tonight amen good question because how you answer that question will tell you whether or not you find yourself in your own Rags towards your story or you still find yourself in rags because if you're if you define your riches as the next house or the next truck or the next promotion or the next person that says I love you or the next person that that accepts you and receives you or or by any other thing than what Christ has already done for you the new has have misidentified yourself amen amen because Christ himself has showered his love upon you he showered his grace upon you it's been showered upon you since 2000 years ago you talk about being born to slavery no you were born to God's righteousness because before the foundation the world my Bible says that you were chosen in Christ who before the foundation of the world was a bloody sacrificial lamb for your sins for your unrighteousness and he had a plan for your lack of righteousness to do away with your filthy garments you're not dressed in rags this evening you're dressed in God's holy white Garment of Praise that's what he wants you to recognize yourself as wearing tonight yes amen you're not trusting someone that I will be one day or I want to be or I should be or I could have been or or I should have been you're dressed as the one who's been proclaimed as a son or a daughter of God and if you don't believe that tonight then then all you have to do is receive God's promise for your life go from being a non-believer go from being a make-believer and say I do believe you can even be like that one man who said he brought us he brought us his his plegic his epileptic son to Christ he said would you heal my boy would you he basically he said my life is broken my life is incomplete here's my son what is your situation here's my situation it's broken it's incomplete there's something wrong here and I don't know how to fix it for him it was his son for you it might be something else but Christ's first question was do you believe he said if thou can'tst believe amen then all things are possible and immediately that man's heart went out and said Lord I believe but helped thou my unbelief oh if you can just start their friends what an honest heart that man had and that's what Christ looks for as honest hearts tonight amen amen God is not a a robot button Pusher he's not looking to open up a panel on your chest and push the buttons to make you go forward tonight he's looking for a relationship he's looking to start a conversation with you yes and look at that man who had a broken son he was honest-hearted enough to say I do believe Lord but I also recognize with enemies some unbelief help it Lord yes Lord and from there a conversation can start from there what's what's he doing he's opened the door of his heart literally say here here let me Lord Lord I don't know how to do this but quickly quickly let me open the door of my heart get your foot in there Lord let's start this conversation help my unbelief and what did he have at the end of the day his situation his Brokenness his son was healed amen and that's what Christ is calling out tonight is saying I recognize that you think you're in bondage you think you're you think you're still wearing filthy rags but I want you to know I want you to become my believing son not just my son but my believing son oh Hallelujah you talk about belief you talk about riches I'll tell you what God's already declared where his riches were where's God's heart at tonight it's where his riches are where he's places value and we know that where he's placed his value is a new friend wheresoever Man's Treasure is there is his heart also and if he spill his blood for you I'd say that his heart is not far behind amen oh Hallelujah but the children of Israel we see their minds still got in the way of what God had for them they got all the way up to the promised land just about dragged through the wilderness or was that it was a type of sanctification dragged through sanctification how many has everyone felt you just feel like you're getting dragged through sanctification yeah I left the world in a hurry I couldn't wait to leave it behind I was so happy to see the Red Sea open and impossible things happen but now that I'm in the desert I just feel like I'm being dragged through sanctification and they said well this sanctification is hard this desert is hard it would be better if I went back to the world why because sanctification is not a fun place to be it's not meant to be where you live you're not meant to be living in the desert you're not called to be living in the desert there's a reason why God made humans dependent upon water and didn't put no water in the desert because you weren't built to live in the desert you weren't built to live in sanctification all the time but the children of Israel got right up to their promise what is that that Promised Land of a life of overcoming the Holy Ghost they got right up to that promise and we find out that only two of them had a vision to cross over only two of them went over there and spot out the land and said you know what these Giants they ain't nothing for my God Amen I can't wait to knock them over like toothpicks these great walled cities I can't wait till we can just see what God does to them and the other ten they walked in there and maybe they saw the a man whipping another man because they were slavers in that land of Canaan as well and brought back all the PTSD all the post-traumatic stress all the memories of being in slavery and they said to themselves no if we go in here we're going to end up slaves again it'd be better for me to stay back there behind Jordan never cross over never dare to live a life in the Holy Ghost it'd be better for me just to practice sanctification to keep my dress long and my hair long and not wear shorts and do all the things that I'm supposed to do and not do all the things I'm not supposed to do those mechanics I can handle that but I don't want to try and fall fat on my face I'm not going to enter into this promise of god good word what was it the lacked a vision oh my what was it they they came back and they shared their own report came out of their own lips we as what was it grasshoppers that's how they saw themselves they said and they see us that way also now I don't think they took a poll didn't ask everybody how do you see us matter of fact we find out a whole generation later The Works of God that God had done for them back at the Red Sea stayed on for a whole generation later and still continued to inspire fear in the hearts of those who lived in Jericho so much so that Rahab said this whole city is in fear of you but they thought that everyone saw them as grasshoppers well maybe they should have been looking at God's testimonies like everybody else was instead of looking at their own shortcomings but the Bible says that where there is no vision the people perish and every one of them perished they're in the wilderness because they had a lack of vision but God is here tonight calling you to a greater Vision than Israelites had Israel wanted to go back to slavery's Comforts they said let me go back to Egypt it would have been better for me now I wonder if there would be anywhere one here tonight that would be making the same mistake that Israel made it says let me let me go back to depression I remember those nights where I would spend all night upon my bed just thinking those dark thoughts and I would wake up in the morning I couldn't get away from them and that despondency and that despair but yet it was a comfort it's it's easier to be staying in depression than finding a way to shake it that's true it's easier to stay all bound up with anger in my heart about what happened over here or what somebody did to me over there and how my life has transformed over here it's easier for me to have this Heart full of anger that old slavery task master than to find a way to take it to the rivers of Jordan and let it die it's easier to just hold it close because it's a comfort to me like I said it's no longer about it's no longer about coughing sin but it's about now being coddled by sin amen amen where we're now getting our if you're not careful you're going to be finding your own comfort in the sin in the anchor oh but brother Josiah you don't understand who I am and the messy things I've done and I deserve my life I deserve what has happened to me and I I deserve and start going down this path of of self-loathing what are you doing you're you're taking all the devil's thoughts and placing it upon yourself there's only one that deserves what happened to him uh Satan amen amen there's only one and in a sense yes you do deserve death because because that's what this human race has coming to it but this human race is also bought and paid for by the blood of Jesus Christ and so by by his by God's accounting you no longer deserve death because he's paid the price there's only one that's not paid for and that's Satan right right there's only one that should be a self-loathing creature tonight amen yeah he's too proudful to be self-loathing so he takes all that and tries to torment you with it it's true but Israel wanted to go back to slavery's Comforts maybe alcoholism would be another comfort that we'd have tonight it was easier to stay without I read I read a testimony recently recently it was the story of a a singer a very famous singer you'd know his name if I were to say it and he was talking about how he grew up in a Pentecostal home in his parents his his father abused him slapped him around and his father was a preacher when he wasn't an alcoholic and he'd go through cycles of getting all the alcohol out of his system and there was nothing he liked better than to go straight back in the Pulpit brother John and be a preacher and how that confused that boy he gave us testimony of how one time he he shared with his friends that sometime his mom and his dad get in a fight and that's all I said he didn't say anything bad or wretched or vile about his parents you might say well that sentence sounds about right I get in fights with my wife sometimes too but they didn't see it that way and he got home and it got back to his mom and she started just wailing on the boy taking every book off a bookshelf and throwing it at this little nine-year-old boy and until he was curl up in the fetal position knocked his ribs out with her feet and kept yelling at him you don't ever talk about our family you don't say anything about what goes on inside this family Pentecostal home that boy grew up and he said the only comfort I had was the singing rambos and I would just let myself dive into that southern gospel music and that's what how many remembers the singing ramble is a that's that's LP record playing material right there he would say that would be the only comfort I would have as that southern gospel music and that's what started me on my journey music I found Comfort there I felt the Holy Spirit draw I could only I could only find peace there in the music but later on when he started his singing career and he got around people that were party animals and he said I they were social Drinkers and that was fine for them but I took one sip of that stuff and all those genes that my father had came back upon me and Don I won no he should have known better and some of us we don't know if that Gene's there or not because our parents were Sanctified and Holy Ghost filled and we we never got to see them in that state but he knew his dad was in that statement yet he reached for that alcohol the genes came back upon him and he said it just about tore upon it apart its marriage but what did he do there was something in him that said I don't want to stay this way yeah it's it's easier he said it was a hard road to get away from that alcohol there were many times when it would have been just easier to stay there that old Egyptian Taskmaster but there was something in them that wanted to change there are hard shackles in this world hard shackles from our phones and from the internet amen things that just take this flesh and they're like a magnet for it but let me tell you friends when God calls you to Deliverance it's not because he has an alternative for you it's because he has something better for you amen you know that's one thing about the blacks when they were freed down there in the southern in the south there was nothing for them to do there was no place for them to go they were still surrounded by so many white folks that didn't care for them and and there wasn't a lot of resources but God took his people he said no we're not staying here no more we're going to leave Egypt behind see you can't separate from slavery without actually separating no wonder there were so many blacks in the South that stayed behind and said I'll just keep on working with my old Masters they had nothing else to go to but God said I've got a plan I've got some place for you to go we're going to part spreads here we're going to go a few days through the Wilderness we're gonna Park the River Jordan we're going to take over Jericho and I've got a whole land that I promised to your forefathers and that's God's vision for you he says look when you get away from alcoholism you stay away from everyone that partakes about of it you stay away from all those old task Masters you stay away from the self-loathing you stay away from the depression you don't think that way you start yielding yourself over to positive thoughts and positive actions and yield your mind to the promises of God and let your mind be transformed according to his word be not conformed according to this word but be transformed by the renewing of your mind how does that happen we renew our mind with positive thoughts that's where this battlefield is at amen positive thoughts not like oh well I like the color red no positive thoughts that have healing and transformative power the Bible says that we're now looking into something that changes us from one Glory into another these are positive thoughts not a man's positive thoughts but God's positive thoughts a passive thought that you can be positive of looking unto Jesus the author and the finisher of our faith just as I would bring things to a close tonight I want to dwell before we would leave on two strange questions that God asks us I always thought these two questions in the scripture were some of the strangest questions ever found it was reasonable for God to ask the man with a paraplegic cell or the epileptic Sun if he believed but what about that time when he went by the pool of Bethesda and there lay a man that hadn't been able to walk since he was just a boy he'd been there for 38 years and the first question that God ever asks of him God and flesh Christ there standing before him could have snapped his fingers and the man would be well they didn't do that why because God is like we said God's not looking for a robot he's not there trying to open up your heart your the panel of your chest and press a button to make you move forward that would have been what he would have if that man was just a robot that God wanted results out of said I want you to walk go walk he would have cut concerned about that man so he asked some of the question he says brother to you one to be well and the first thing that that man gives is a bunch of excuses about why he hasn't gotten well and he can't get he can't get the water and before he can get there somebody else gets there before him and all these things but God's asking no no you don't understand do you want to be well because there's consequences to being well you've gotten used to being a panhandler all your life you've been there for 38 years you know what it's like to be a panhandler you're probably pretty comfortable with it got the panhandler thing down if you know how to make the sad faces you know how to get people to give you some money you know how this works just like the children of Israel kind of knew how slavery worked but if I make you well things are going to have to change and it's not going to be comfortable and there will be no going back you're you're going to be required to go get yourself a job Society is not going to give you handouts anymore you're going to have to walk on your own two feet earn a living for yourself people are going to look at you differently than they than you've looked at before you're going to have to look at yourself differently than you've looked at yourself before do you want to be well oh my now we're getting to some serious conversations with Christ you know I've had a lot of conversations with myself where the question wasn't do I want to but it was more like should I do this or could I do this you know that's a unending conversation should there's a lot of things I should do I remember when I first graduated from college it would have been a fine thing to go and pursue a master's degree and but at the end of the day I signed up for the classes and I just didn't have the want to in my imagination I thought having a couple extra letters after my name looked pretty good you know it's kind of like around January 1st you kind of think about all the things that you should do you get this imagination your and your mind yeah it'd be pretty nice to have some good muscles and be able to run a five minute mile and get kind of carried away with all the things that you ought to be doing and then if you're a little bit like me you also get a little bit burdened by all the things you ought to be doing I should have done this and I should have done this in life and I wish I would have done that I should maybe you might think I should be smarter if I hadn't done all those drugs I could have been a lot smaller I could have done this I could have done that gonna wash and all the shoulds of life and all things that would be fine things to do oh my I can put you asleep right now just thinking about all the things we could have done and should have done and should do it's an endless conversation isn't it man I could spend a whole Saturday morning just wrapped up imaginations wishful thinking regretful thoughts but it's a different conversation with god when God knocks on your door and says what do you want I wonder if you let that conversation begin to start tonight between you and your savior because God wants to know what you want I remember a conversation between brother Perry green brother Branham and brother Peregrine was thinking to come up to Art From from Texas up to Arizona to put his shoulder to the wheel with brother Brown there in Arizona he didn't really brought us the topic but brother Perry gives the testimony for the brand just kind of knew that it was on his heart and said you know brother Perry there's three things in life that you gotta look to line up to find God's will for your life and says you know when you're coming up a boat in to the Harbor House it was dark and foggy at night and that Harbor House they they line up three lights and when you've got all lights in the line you know you're straight it says the first thing that you've got to look for is you've got to look for is there a scripture for this in my life is there scripture for and when it comes to leaving behind Egypt and leaving behind slavery of the world there's a lot of scripture for that friend when it comes to are you going to be free from cancer there's a lot of scripture for that when it comes to are you going to be well would Christ make you well there's all kinds of scripture for that so we've got that down the next light that brother Brown gave brother Perry was does God make a way of Providence for it is there a door that God would open for it and again we're thinking about just these basic things like this man here that's been 38 years there's a door opening Christ said I am the door I am the way I'm standing here before you and Christ is standing here before you tonight knocking at your heart's door if you hear that little knock this evening know that that's not a man knocking on your heart's door I'm just sharing with you the same Christ that's knocked on my door time and time again and he's walking over from my house and my experience he's knocking on your door this evening now so there is a door that's opening to you tonight but then the last Light that brother Baron gave was finally do you want to do it do you want to be well God's looking for people that want to do things do you want to be a minister do you want to be a missionary do you want to be a songwriter like Fanny Crosby there's a lot of things that I should have done life a lot of things that were fine things to do there's things that my church that I've even signed up for and I've thought about how it would be a fine thing for me to volunteer but there was never fruit to it because my heart of heart that wasn't what I wanted to do I was doing it out of obligation friend find what God is directing your heart towards see God this the miracle of free moral agency God is not opposed to your will God wants your will to align with his that's right he made you in His image and then he came along and said if any two should agree on one thing it should not be impossible for them amen so Christ wants your will to align with him and then there's there's two that are in agreement you win Christ two free moral agents there's you can't have that with an angel brother John amen an angel just takes marching orders but a Son of God he has the potential to agree with his father amen so Christ asked this man do you want to be well and I want to ask you tonight I believe that's God's question for anyone that's sick or Afflicted with sin tonight do you want to be well do you want to change not just it's a good idea but is that something you want is this something you're willing to work for tonight think about Naaman he he didn't there was no snapping his fingers name it had to get down in the muddy Jordan and wash seven times and he he almost turned his back on the idea but his servant said look it's a small thing compared to what you're getting it's a small thing right and Friends compared to what you're giving compared to eternal life compared to a life that's free in the Holy Ghost compared to a life of Victory and conquest and favor with God and where all these trials that you're now dealing with are behind you and you can say I have them under my feet compared to that whatever you have to push through to get there is a small thing amen like washing seven times in the River Jordan do you want to be well and the next question that I find so remarkable in scripture the question we find all the way back there and in the Old Testament when we see Jacob whose name was Deceiver they went through all of his life with that name attached to him one who deceives because he because of his birth and then he fulfills it time and time again by not only his birth but by his personality deceiving his mother and deceiving deceiving his father and deceiving deceiving later his uncle Jacob The Deceiver but notice now when it came time that that remarkable point in Jacob's life where he began to fight with that angel because he knew that this was a crucial moment and I pray that there could be a crucial moment that would interrupt your life this evening I believe it's possible not because of the preacher but because the god that's standing here tonight that now is a crucial moment and if you just lay hand of the a hold of the Angel tonight I wonder what would have happened that night if well while Jacob was standing there in fear of his life from Esau he had set his family on ahead of him and he was just there left alone and the Bible says there there appeared in a man an angel of the Lord I wonder what would have happened if Jake would just let that angel go on nothing it would not have been a crucial moment but Jacob made the crucial moment when he laid hands on that angel and he wrestled him all night long he said I need a blessing I I want to change I want something different in my life something has to happen tonight because tomorrow I'm a dead man and that's the kind of attitude that you've got to take in your life when you recognize that you've spent too long in despondency when you've spent too long in alcoholism when you've spent too long in pornography when you spent too long on addictions when you recognize that there's something in your life that has to change and if you don't find a mile marker somewhere if you don't find a tie post somewhere you're going to get washed out to see and you recognize I've got to grab a hold of God that's where Jacob was at that night he wanted to change he wanted something to happen but he didn't know what he just knew that he needed a blessing from God and when he showed that that that that that Terror of his soul to that angel that he fought that night what was that Mighty Angels question to him I believe that was Christ what did he ask Ed says what's your name imagine that Brother Bruce you're fighting all night long I mean this is this is an epic battle This Is The Stuff of Legends man they're fighting until their bodies are just slipping past each other from the sweat it wasn't like fighting in the living room with your brothers this was this was so much that this is his whole leg fell out of its socket and still this man was fighting and they you can imagine you fight for hours every muscle movement it's just like slow motion everything is just so intense you you don't have any energy left he's pushed against you you're pushing against him and it's just a deadlock and then he says hey what's your name does that strike anybody is weird why did he asked that question because it was important Jacob said my name is Jacob Deceiver deceiver of my brother deceiver of my father deceivable of my uncle deceiving of the deceiver of the handmaiden that bore me just thought that I was coming out first and I didn't Deceiver that's all he knew himself to be that was his identity and what did that angel say he'll no longer be called deceiver hey from now on you're going to be called Israel which means prince who has power with God what did he do he gave him a new identity that's what Israel needed back in the day when they came up against that promise and saw themselves as grasshoppers their mind got in the way because their identity was false it was established based upon their experiences as slaves and said the promises of God you know there I I heard a testimony of a of a lady and she she told me that when she was growing up she she always heard the ministry talked about that quote where brother Branham says if this bride would ever recognize who the what the church is and who she is she would be an invincible Army and she would come up for prayer and she would say I I just want to know who I am I I just want that revelation of who I am I think what a shame that was that she didn't know who she was if I could wind back time and look that little girl in the face as that Minister I would want to tell her honey who you are as a daughter of God honey who you are is the Beloved of Jesus Christ accepted in his family honey who you are is a Chosen One chosen in Jesus Christ before the foundation of the world honey who you are is the friend of God because he said that whosoever would obey my Commandments is my friend just as Abraham was his friend I'd say honey you are complete and Jesus Christ this is what the scripture saith about you listen friend brother Brown when he when he preached those Seven Seals he said it's not something new it's something that was already in this book not the six seals all the way to the seventh it was already in this book and our identity that we're looking for to be an invincible Army is in this book but we've got to not be like Israel who didn't believe what God told them if Israel had believed that they would have been the Invincible army they would not have been grasshoppers they would have not have spent another 40 years in sanctification until they all passed out from exhaustion and death they would have been a Invincible Army Unstoppable amen amen as they eventually were friend God is calling you to be an invincible Army but he wants to ask you what's your name tonight do you want to change do you want to be well because God has a vision for your life don't go find your own Vision that's trash that's trash that's a bunch of Shoulda wouldas could us that's an endless conversation God has one vision for your life would you like to go find it let's stand I wonder if I could have every head bowed this evening I just want to lay out those two questions to you again I pray that you'd let it per me into your soul as those questions have been permeating into my soul even you know it's it's not just the believer that's not yet filled with the Holy Ghost that has to wrestle with Jordan there's parts of us that have to be seems like parts of us get left on the other side of Jordan and we have to go back and drag them through that River of death all over again that as long as you're in the flesh will never stop because we're being changed from one glory to another Glory but whether young or old tonight I wonder if you would look and your life that there would be something you would see that Jesus would be knocking tonight if you are hearing his voice say do you want that to be changed or do you want to keep it the rest of your life I wonder if you'd start that conversation with the Lord see I don't believe in a button pushing God I believe in a God that can snap his fingers and change the whole situation of the night but I also believe in a god of relationship a God that changes from glory to glory and not everything has to happen tonight but I wonder if you would answer his question to your heart tonight that he gave me to bring to you do you want to be well do you want to lay your burdens at Jesus's feet will you commit to not grabbing hold of those burdens when you leave those doors but leave them behind and secondly what's your name tonight would you recognize your situation my name is despondent my name is depressed my name is addicted my name is not well my name is broken there's something wrong with me would you be that honest as Jacob was with that angel would you be honest enough to tell God how you see yourself but to recognize that it doesn't have to end there is a power of transformation tonight assures Christ shed his blood for you it wants to take you to the next Glory that God has for you let's go before the Lord in prayer dear Lord Jesus we just come before you father Lord I'm humbled that you would make yourself so real to your people Lord that you'd ask those intimate personal questions on the way here I was thinking how in my mind I've often wish that you just give me a directive give me a a revelation give me some straight answer on things but how often it is that your most transformative work starts with questions Lord conversations do you believe do you want to be well what is your name all those things could be dressed with a snap of your fingers but you didn't do it that way Lord and it just proclaims to me a God that loves me enough to take me into his arms and sit down at life's table with me and to sup when I open my heart's door to you have a conversation with you and be changed by you Lord Lord it Thrills my heart that I could share that same Jesus with this group tonight Lord I believe that there's a group of people here that is believing on you for it Lord Lord I pray even as you see each conversation that's happening in each heart now Lord you would go to that heart now Lord it made that conversation not end tonight Lord but may there be a changing from Glory unto Glory unto glory in each young and old believer here tonight and may they be well Lord may they be changed and may they see themselves as you see them Lord princes and princesses sons and daughters who have power with God Kings and Priests into the most high God an army not to be reckoned with a powerful force that cannot be dismayed oh God thank you Lord we commit these Hearts to you now Lord in Jesus Christ name amen marks you can come if we could sing a word of praise the Lord if there would be anyone that would want to stay and pray a while your pews are open this altar's open I'd be happy to pray with you God bless you Saints it's been an honor serving you in the word of this evening God bless you brother Mark [Music] can do what he's done for us [Music] it is [Music]
