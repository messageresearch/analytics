all things are possible Jesus is he amen amen the more that we can believe that the more we can receive whatever our need would be amen may the Lord increase our faith to where all things would be possible whatever need that we would have in our life brother Branham says that we create an atmosphere and we create an atmosphere of faith and um it's up it's between us as individuals and the Lord of course we want the whole place just to be on fire we want the whole place to just be as as it was in the medians where brother Brandon said it was just a milky white atmosphere out there but it has to start with it with one and then it catches so you you you be that one that you're really believing God is here for you and then just act upon that and and I do believe that the presence of the Lord uh will will spread amen amen God bless you this morning it's good to be in the house of the Lord God bless her our sister I you look so familiar yeah sister Leah of course of course of course you look so so familiar God bless you uh this morning amen turn with me if you would to the book of Galatians it will have two readings one will be Galatians chapter 5 and Hebrews chapter 12. so good to see brother Jonathan sister Gabrielle amen no they've been and a tremendous battle but I'll say this the prayers of the Saints have been behind them amen been with them behind them and we are believing through everything that God Will Make A Way he promised to make a way amen before we read here in Galatians let's look to the author our dear heavenly father we give you thanks we give you praise and we honor you today Lord that you've given us strength Health to be in the house of the Lord today to worship you to praise you to be with brothers and sisters of light precious faith and Lord to hear from heaven Lord we're we're capable of reading uh the the Bible but Lord we're not capable of getting Revelation on our own and our dependency is upon you this morning we pray that you would come and reveal this word to us that we may leave here Lord on fire for you Lord just pressing towards uh the mark for the prize in the High Calling Lord we love you this morning and we commit ourselves to you we commit our needs to you we trust Lord that you just increase our faith Lord now as we look to you in Jesus precious name we pray amen amen Galatians chapter 5 starting with verse number seven the Bible says ye did run well who did hinder you that ye should not obey the truth he said this persuasion cometh not from him that originally calleth you A little leaven eth the whole lump amen then Hebrews chapter 12. it only takes a little bit to get us to stop running amen amen just a little bit remember the The Tortoise and the the rabbit you know just took a little bit that rabbit got distracted but that tortoise was focused amen Hebrews chapter 12 verse number one wherefore seeing we also are compassed about what's so great a cloud of witnesses amen let us lay aside every weight and the sin which does so easily beset us and let us run with patience the race that is set before us looking unto Jesus the author and the finisher of our faith who for the joy that was set before him endured the cross despising the shame and is set down at the right hand of the Throne of God Amen God bless you may be seated may the Lord just Quicken his word to us today brother Branham said in the message does God change his mind in 65 he says and we're all sure that there is a church and there is a bride coming out of that church we know that that is true when the bride hears the word she runs from church natural to become the word bride so there is a mixture and when they came out of Egypt they were all mixed multitude brother Branham talks about uh in every Church there's that that mixture there and there is a bride coming out of the church there just isn't a group of people coming out of a denomination church or a man-made Church there is literally a bride coming out of the church and I'd like to entitle this run bride run bride run now the church natural is Anointed it is it's an it's Anointed with a laodicean spirit complacent self-satisfied and careless exercising a spiritual need of nothing right God could not describe this church as being on fire he couldn't describe this church as being ice cold it was somewhere in between a lukewarm condition and I believe the church is stuck there that's what the spirit is it's a it's a lukewarm condition but the bride is running away from that anointing Amanda bride is working out her own salvation with fear and trembling see there's something that comes uh with the bride there is a fear that's always there I need to be doing better I need to make sure I need to press in but Church natural feels always content in the condition that they're in but the Branham said in the Massachusetts and the bride he says the true bride attracts the attention of God by keeping the word amen that's how she gets the attention and you know wives when they want to get the attention of their husband they know how to do it right but the bride the way the bride gets a hold of the bridegroom is by following the word that God had given her and that attraction that makes him give attention to the bride in Philippians chapter 2 verse 12 Paul writing to the church he says wherefore my beloved as ye have always obeyed not in my presence only but now much more in my absence work out your own salvation with fear and trembling for it is God which worketh in you both to Will and to do of his good pleasure so do it without murmuring do all things without murmurings and disputings why that you may be blameless harmless the sons of God without rebuke in the midst of a crooked and perverse Nation well that sounds like the age that we're living in isn't it amen a crooked and perverse Nation among whom you shine as lights in the world holding forth the word of life amen holding forth the word of life that I may rejoice in the day of Christ that I have not run in vain neither labored in vain you know there's obviously going to be a large group of people that have run in vain because Jesus said many shall come to me many shall come to me we're in a race to get ourselves ready for God's spiritual plan and I believe he wants us to enter into a Rapture don't you believe that the Bible says let us be glad and rejoice and give honor to him for the marriage of the Lamb has come and his wife have made herself ready that's the that's the plan that God has for the bride is to get ready so we can go on a Rapture and be with him and the message of choosing of the Bride brother Branham says now we see plainly the spiritual plan of God's planning for his future home with his future bride it comes into view right now so we see God's plan we should not be wondering what God wants us to do we shouldn't be wondering waiting what's going to be happening we know what God wants us to do he wants us to get serious about getting ready amen and we're instructed by the uh race official here to lay aside every weight and the sin that does so easily beset us amen you know things have a way of creeping in so good to see you brother Lando been praying for you thinking about you so much amen you know things have a way of creeping in you take care of things and all of a sudden things want to creep back in and they they want to latch on they want to become a weight to us they want to keep us from running the race the way that we should be running now most people look to Jesus who authored their faith but they don't seem to look any further they don't look to him as far as the finisher of their faith they feel like oh well where's God and why isn't he doing this and I'll come and they they just they only look back towards what has happened in the past right and and some have this attitude well since I've I've I've repented and I got baptized that that I got my salvation sold up and there's no need to really work on my salvation because I already have it and I'm a believer that once saved always saved oh that is scary because we we need to have fear and trembling we need to Jesus himself said he that endured to the end the same shall be saved amen so repentance and baptism and the giving of our hearts to Jesus Christ that is where God authored our faith amen that's where it all began but that's not the end of the requirements that's just the beginning are you with me if you believe the word say Amen now if we were to die at that point we would be ready that is true but if God gives us another day to live that he he has an expectation of what we're going to do with the truth that he gives us that day amen he wants us to keep running in the same direction that we started he wants us to keep pressing towards the mark for the prize of the high calling in Christ Jesus he wants us to keep fighting for the original faith that was once delivered to the Saints he wants us to keep adding to our faith our original Faith virtue and then knowledge and Temperance and and patience and and godliness and brotherly kindness and charity there's a continuation that God has for us if he gives us another day he wants us to keep pressing forward to keep adding to become more than we were the day before now this is a very huge responsibility it requires a lot of effort it's not like putting an egg into a microwave and hitting 30 seconds or whatever it is it requires a lot but we need to be doing this until when brother John how long how long do I got to keep trying as hard as I did when I first started well Ephesians 4 13 tells us till we all come into the unity of the faith and of the knowledge of the son of God unto a perfect man unto the measure of the Statue of the fullness of Christ wow so we're in a race till we come to the manifestation of Christ in her life so anytime that you look at your life and you say I don't need to be pressing you're saying one of two things here you're saying either you're there or you're not part of because the bride will become just like him and there's something in her there's a deep calling that wants to be just like Jesus I mean a perfect marriage is you you want you just the bride looks up to the husband in in a right marriage right and uh there's just certain qualities about the bridegroom that the bride has but you know the bride likes the the groom likes the qualities that the bride has if it's the ones that he has set forth for her and and I I I feel that the bride needs to run she needs to run towards the manifestation of Christ not just going to and fro and here and there and but she needs to be focusing on becoming all that Christ has called her to become now here's the thing my sheep hear my voice and it's an individual walk we're not going collectively in the Rapture God will not send us a telegram telling us when the Rapture is make sure we're ready let's all meet at the church we're taken off from here it will not happen like that so it is an individual Affair we must we must hear the voice of God in the ministry of the word we must in the message the marriage of the land brother Brandon says God has got Amazing Grace to save you and he will do it but if you'll fight but you'll fight every inch of your way he said I've been behind the pulpit going on 31 years and every inch of that has been a fight constantly it certainly has but we must fight if we must reign so we find that the bride has to make herself ready be willing to lay aside every weight that does so easily besetter and we that we might run with patience the race that's set before us brother Brahms Colton there in Hebrews he said we must lay aside ourself now he's starting to identify what the weight is we must lay aside ourselves we can't say God you come and lay them aside for us we've got to do that ourselves see we have a part to play in this race now the majority of the people who started this race never complete it remember that statement the majority of the people who started this race never complete it there's various reasons for it they get distracted dismayed discouraged deceived Satan will offer the world to people whatever a man wants becomes his downfall whatever a man wants literally becomes his downfall the only thing that he can want that won't become his downfall is Christ Satan's goal is to get our eyes off of Christ James chapter 1 verse 14 says but every man is tempted when he's drawn away of his own lust and enticed every man is drawn away of his own longing and his own desire that's what that word lust means his own longing his own desires and he becomes entrapped or beguiled see it's free more agency God is not going to go against him or agency if that's what a person wants that's that's what that's what God will allow so the bride is the only one that will not let her flesh get in the way of her goal which is to become like Christ right brother man says we must lay aside ourselves so some enter this race not really knowing the cost you know this is all you got to do just you know get baptized everything should work out okay in my life some think it's easy race some think it's a it's a short you know race you just all you got to do is fill in the blank just maybe just hit Church once a week are you with me but the majority of the people who enter this race enter it with a broad way of thinking that they can make it on their terms their ways their ideas like they've got it figured out Proverbs 14 12 says there is a way that seemeth right unto man but the end thereof are the ways of death and Jesus described this broad way it leads to destruction and there be wit and many there be which go in there at so we see that there's a lot of people who never complete they never complete the race that's right they get deceived along the way Luke 13 verse 23 then said one unto him Lord are there few that be saved I like the way that he answered he didn't say yes or no he said strive to enter in at the Straight Gate for many I say unto you will seek to enter in and shall not be able it it requires something of the heart and of the life and of the will of man a condition that requires striving now if we were going to run a a dash a hundred yard dash well we would put everything we got into that because we only have to go 100 yards but this race is a race with all of our life amen so you can't just you know run a hundred yards and then take a break and then run another 100 yards and take a break I'll go to church and then take a break for a week go to church and take it that is not the race that we're in we're in a race that requires a continual striving a continual pressing you will find in most all people a desire for God and a willingness to seek truth but what separates the bride from the church is she's giving her all to manifest Christ and you may not know it to the very end I mean look what happened to Judas no one would have never guessed Judas would end up where he was why number one because Jesus chose them if Jesus told them that's good enough for me right I would have never I would have never guessed it right right but he chose them that the scripture might be fulfilled and and that's why we should never be shaken what we see happen or not happening in a church God's got everything under control but what's really really important is that we the bride run we run this race as if our life depends upon it our show depends the manifestation of Christ in our life depends upon it to find God at all the crossroads of your life requires all of your heart's desire that's the only way you'll Truly find God when you want him more than anything I don't care if you just started I don't care if you're going through a dry spell I don't care what Crossroad you are in your life if you want to find God it's one simple ingredient Jeremiah 29 13 we all know it and ye shall seek me and find me when you search for me with all your heart now if you tell me you've done that but he hasn't showed up I would have to say you're a liar versus God because God can't lie we may think we've searched with all of our we may think we've tried with all of our heart but the honest truth is if he hasn't showed up yet that means we need to keep amen we just need to keep going keep keep and then he'll keep his word amen and I will be found if you saith the Lord and I will turn away your captivity how many wants a closer walk with the Lord amen seeking the Lord with all your heart is the only way to get get ahead in this race looking unto Jesus the author and the finisher of our faith and then lay aside the things in your life that are holding you back I'm sure we should all be able to look at our life today and see that there's things that's keeping us from pressing into the Lord come on Amen come on this is church we should be able to talk about those things that's what church is for right amen that's all I say to the bride now I'm talking to the bride I'm not talking to the church that's right run run bride the devil will do everything he can to keep you from not going in the Rapture he would like to see everybody go through tribulation but we're in a race this is not the time to get our eyes on the foolish virgins right comparing yourself with somebody who hasn't press it in oh I'm doing better than they are what a trick that that is not a time to be looking at the foolish virgins this is the time to get our eyes back on the promise what promise that I will manifest Jesus Christ that's what's important this needs to become your goal it is the goal of the Bride it it she attracts the groom by obeying the word that he gives her so it's up to you to to be able to leave here and say God spoke to me this because if you can't say that how can you walk out and do it right because if you hear the word you do it now you're going to attract God and we all want we all want to be attracted by God right amen amen we're on a race whether we realize it or not the world isn't a rat race they're going to and fro trying to get ahead keep up with the Joneses and so forth but for the believer whether we're on fire for God or we're backslidden without the joy of the Lord we're in a race we may be uh wandering in the wrong things but we're in a race and there's no time to wait for someone to throw us a pity party to come over throw us a pity party and help us feel better in our condition we need to get up and we need to start running this race with all of our hearts now God promised that he had not put anything on us that we couldn't bear amen amen and I am sure this that on the day of judgment there will not be one person that will be able to tell God or prove to God that he did right but yet you will have a world full of people trying to tell God that they gave him too much so I say to you get up and start running the race lay aside what needs to be laid aside First Corinthians 9 verse 24 know ye not that they which run in a race run all in other words we're all in a race but one receiveth the prize so run that you may attain now we're all on a race but unfortunately you're not running against me and I ain't running against you we're not running against one another we don't compare ourselves with one another that's unwise but we are in a race the natural man and the spiritual man they're running amen problem is most Believers are not running to obtain right true and Paul said here so run that ye may obtain why did you come to church today is it because it's Sunday so you're obtaining church on Sunday what did you come for it's like the scripture what did you go out to see Jesus asked the question what are you here to obtain we need to run with the mindset of obtaining that's where faith comes in that I am going to manifest Christ I'm not going to just be filled with head knowledge is not going to get you in a rapture no it's a manifestation of Christ thank you they run a lot of people run as if they've already obtained right that's what that's what gets them in that lukewarm layout to see in need of nothing you're stuck they're stuck there but the scripture says and every man that striveth for the Mastery is temperate in all things now they do it to obtain a corruptable crown but we in uncorruptable crowns so in other words you that are going to be watching who's going to watch the Pro Bowl today isn't there a pro bowl or no I think so are the Super Bowl's coming up next week and so these people who are in this race I don't care if you're a runner or what sport you're in you literally spend time practicing right getting in shape and and you you don't play against people who don't hardly know how to play you you you're you you you're trained because you need to be the best and so we're in a race to overcome and Satan knows how to use our flesh to keep us from being Overcomers how to keep us down but we've been taught God has sent a message for us we have the blueprint in this word of God how to be an overcomer we've been trained by the best to be the best for the best amen he says I therefore so run not as uncertainly I'm not sure if I'm gonna I'm not sure if I'm gonna be the bride or not Soul fight I not as one that beateth the air I mean if you go like this real hard you know what you're gonna you know what you're gonna hurt is this roof you got to make contact gotta know who your enemy is [Music] your enemy isn't me right your enemy isn't your brother your sister your husband your wife your children your mother your father you know your enemy is you and you gotta like know what you're hitting when you're going for him not physically no I don't want you coming to coming to church with black and blue face here it is but I keep under my body and bring it into subjection lest by any means when I preach to others I myself should be a Castaway now all of our bodies everyone there is nobody here whose body is better than anybody else's body everybody here everybody not everybody but everybody has the capability of rising up lashing out and trying to take over the spiritual man Paul says we're in a race and this race requires us to keep this body under subjection or else we're not winning the race no Satan has already shall we say he did a Mastery job with our flesh we didn't even have to be taught to lie to steal we were doing that without Mom and Dad teaching us so he's he knows how to get this flash to achieve deceiving things but now we we want to win this race we want to make a rapture we want to get out of here we do not want to be left behind with laodicea amen we do not want to be left behind with the foolish virgins we do not want to be left behind with those who did not want to give all their heart so the word is teaching us the message is teaching us what we need to do and part of that is keep our body under subjection to what to the word fear that word fear that word reverence that word god what would you have me to do do not expect God to come and call out your name and say this is what you need to be doing you need to let God so bad that you you that you prepare your heart and say God there may be a thousand two thousand three thousand words spoken today but if you just speak one word to me personally I will do it Lord that's what God is looking for and that's what the bride has I believe that Paul's battle or his race was against a lazy flesh didn't want to stay dead that's why he said I Die daily he didn't say I die on Sundays I start my week off no I Die daily it's something that we need to think about do we even think about dying daily do we automatically think we're dead daily if you're going to think oh anything automatically think that you're alive your flesh is alive wants to do its will if you're going to think automatically that's the way to overthink that's the way to think because we need to Die daily if Paul needed to Die daily if Jesus told us that we need to Die daily then we need to Die daily amen amen I know it may not sound fun but I'll tell you what the quicker you agree with the word the quicker the devil will leave you sir amen the devil isn't out here he's here and we need to get him out of here he said I keep under my body and bring it into subjection it takes a Act of crucifying of the flesh to for that to happen that's what keeps the bride running her race victoriously is is by keeping her flesh under subjection when it wants to rise up no she goes to God In Prayer she learns to say I'm sorry when she's wrong she learns to every time she falls she gets back up right that's what the Bible says if a righteous man falls seven times seven times he'll get back up it doesn't say if a sinner falls seven times he'll get back up no a sinner when he falls he doesn't want to repent he doesn't get back up the very fact that you repent that you get back up shows where you're standing in the economy of God now Jesus born died a sinless lamb of God to take away the sins of the world for for Adam for Eve that we could be saved he sent his only begotten son now Jesus did this for the whole world but in order for the whole world to benefit from the death they need to receive it right it's all about receiving it's all about receiving the word now they you don't receive it as a gift right as a natural gift you don't receive it is a gift but you don't receive it as a gift this you have to give something you can't earn it can't work for it but he doesn't give salvation like this to everybody he gives his gifts like that but he doesn't give salvation like that you have to you have to repent of your your life your nature and you have to accept his will into your heart is that right the Bible says he came to his own and his own received him not but as many as received him then gave he power to become sons of God power to become a son it takes power to become a son a lot of people they'll hear the word of God and they'll do nothing they'll literally do nothing it literally takes power to become and what is that power well we know the Holy Ghost is power so you shall receive power after the Holy Ghost has come upon you when you believe the word of God it becomes real to you you may not feel it you may not taste it but it becomes real to you it will become manifested to you First Corinthians chapter 12 verse 13 says for by one Spirit we are all baptized into one body whether it be jew or Gentile whether it be bonder free whether at all and have been all made to drink into one spirit so what is the one thing that we all have in common here it's the Holy Ghost it's the spirit of God that puts us all in common amen and the the more that the blood of Jesus Christ cleanses us from all of our sins the more in unity we become I'll tell you I I like this word being preached I don't know about you all right Romans chapter 6 verse 3 keep in mind that word baptized that word baptized what that word baptized means is to make whelm that is fully wet in golf submerged or buried so I just keep that in mind now we know that speaking of the spiritual baptism okay Romans 6 verse 3 says know ye not that so many of us as we're baptized into Jesus Christ were baptized into his death a lot of people don't think about that this is not just for water baptism although it's a perfect type to be totally engulfed by water fully wet by submersion we don't bring in believe in sprinkling we just we we got to go all the way under we got to be buried now water baptism doesn't save us right the Bible says it's just an outward expression of what's going on on the inside so what is going on on the inside the Holy Ghost is engulfing us it's it's taking over our desires it's it's making us new creatures amen and it happens daily it happens Moment by moment it's happening with the bride this ain't happening with the church that's why I say run bride run focus on the Lord focus on the word don't get your eyes on anybody else anything else you're going to miss it because the devil is just you know rocking everybody to sleep if that Parable think about it that parable about the ten virgins the Bible says they all slept so we need yeah we need to to wake up and press in because it's getting close don't you believe that if you want to win the race we must become fully engulfed submerged or buried in the Holy Ghost don't just be satisfied with the portion you have want more want more always want more it's not we're not saying God hasn't done enough for us but that God wants to give us more than we want to have but God is wanting us to hunger to thirst to spend time in prayer to say God I want more of you I want to manifest I want to sh I want to show forth you Lord in the middle of my trials I want everybody to see you in the middle of my trial I don't want them to see me I don't want them to see carnal I don't want them to see me shriveled up dried up without any fruit I want them to see love joy peace long-suffering gentleness I want them to see the power of God living in me amen not just the power of God that I can speak over somebody but the power of God living in me because that's why God sent the Holy Ghost he wouldn't let him go out witnessing until they had the Holy Ghost hey for by one Spirit we are all baptized into one body water baptism puts us into the race spiritual baptism gives us power for the race amen yes no you're not that so many of us were baptized into Jesus Christ we're baptized into his death now this is type when we went down into the water to get baptized we were burying our old selfish nature if you remember the person that talked to you when you got baptized they talked to you are you ready to put your your past not just your sins but your past life I don't believe anyone that really baptized uh baptized a person would ever say are you ready to get ready your sins of your past but you can keep doing them no so that baptism when you went down into the water that was a type of what you're going to do with your life that you're going to bury your past and that you're going to wake up you're going to come out of that water with a new Direction are you with me amen all right verse 4 therefore we are buried with him by baptism into his death that like as Christ was raised up from the dead by the glory of the father even so we should walk in newness of life we should walk in newness of life oh my how many hungers for that how many's thirsting for that now this is not something that we try to do on our own right we don't try to walk on our own if there's anything that we need to try to do is die out to our will and let the Holy Ghost come in let the Holy Ghost have its way if we're really sincere about dying out to our selfish nature God will provide to us newness of life but we got to do our part first for if we have been planted together in the likeness of his death we shall also be in the likeness of his resurrection now I'll say you can't fake death we've all seen those movies or stories or something where somebody fakes their death right but they're still alive but you can't fake your death it don't take long and people know whether you're still kicking or not amen either our nature is manifesting Christ or we're still kicking and it's not a one time deal it's something that has to be done on a regular basis on a regular basis the bride will be the only one willing to die out all the way that's why I say run she's the only one that's willing to go all the way everybody else will go partial the church will go part way I mean brother Bram talked about Judas right he went almost all the way but then at the end he stopped the foolish virgins will stop short somewhere along the way but I say to the bride run run with all your heart go after him go after him go after the bridegroom go after your husband run that you may obtain Ron that you may obtain knowing this verse 6 that our old man is crucified with him that the body of sin might be destroyed that henceforth we should not serve sin for he that is dead is free from sin henceforth we should not serve sin what is sin ourselves for he that is deep dead is freed from himself the bride has risen with Christ she's in another dimension she's in connection cheese walking in newness of life she is spending time seeking the Lord Colossians chapter 3 verse 1 says if ye then be risen with Christ seek those things which are above where Christ sitteth on the right hand of God set your affections on things above not on things on the Earth show on a difference now you know there's nothing more that Satan would like to do is to get us so busy that we just don't got time but you know what I'd rather have everything else go in my life and put Christ first give him time spend time with him and seek him because you know what no matter no matter and I under believe me I have a lot of bosses at trusted too every one of our customer is my boss right and if I don't please him well then they'll get somebody else so I know what it's like to be under subjection to not one or two but to a lot of bosses and to keep them balanced and to make sure one doesn't cross the other so you got to keep them all happy but I'll tell you what as much as if I had to if I had to I don't believe the Lord puts me in that condition unless I make a mistake but if I had to I would have to let all that go to make sure God was first in my life I don't think he would put me in that position and that's why we made a decision that we will never work a Sunday it was made before it started and the thing is if you put God first he will bless you for putting him first but putting him first is not just say I put you first you literally got to do it and you will be tested we've got to see those things which are above we've got to find time to do it the bride will do it Revelations chapter 4 verse one after this I looked and behold a door was open in heaven the first voice which I heard was as it were the trumpet talking to me which said come up hither and I will show thee things which must be Hereafter I just want to say this if you really really really want to hear from God if you really want a closer walk if you want him to show you things to come come up hither amen seek the Lord don't stay down here where you're at start looking for something more than where you're at I tell you if we're going to come up hither we would have to actually go like this we can't stay in the same category the same place that we're at so to come up hither you've got to seek the Lord more you've got to press in you've got to say God I need you Lord look what I'm going through I'm calling upon you this is what the bride does the bride does this not the foolish version if you want a closer walk with Christ start seeking them more you know the song If you always do what you've always done you're always going to get what you always got so you got to do something different to get something different amen it's time to set your affections on things above it's time to seek those things that are above it's time to draw nigh to God it's time bride we must always remember that we're in a race till we're out of here we haven't won the race we haven't won it the way the tree falls that's the way it lies right even though the works were finished from the foundation of the world we must complete our race our leg the part that we play we need to look to Jesus Jesus never stopped the race he never stopped until his natural life was over think about that the race wasn't over until he hung on the cross and said it is finished he still had to run the race and we need to keep running the race with patience right to the very end of our lives Paul kept running the race to the very end here in Philippians chapter 3 we all know the scriptures I just want you to I want you to see where where ask yourself where your attitude is at today he says not as though I've already attained either we're already perfect that means complete but I follow after if that I may apprehend that for which I'm also which also I am apprehended of Jesus Christ Brethren I count not myself to have apprehended but this one thing I do I'm forgetting those things which are behind and I'm reaching forth unto those things which are before me I press toward the mark for the prize of the High Calling of God in Christ Jesus what an example Paul was for us always pressing he was always running the race amen amen I say to the bride here whosoever the bride I don't know who's bride I don't but I say to the bride run bride run the devil's after us all he wants to keep us from the holy ghost from power to overcome he wants to keep us from coming to church he wants to keep us from getting grounded and and rooted in the love of God can you say Amen to that has the devil ever spoke those things to you of course we should be saying Amen to that he's trying to keep us so busy that we can't even get to church we can't even listen to The Prophet we can't look for lost souls we can't help the body we don't get serious with God brother Brian said in the message God's provided a way of approach to Fellowship he says if she don't want to go into the complete fellowship and relationship with her husband if she don't want to go into the complete fellowship and relationship with her husband there'll never be any more life and you understand what brother Brandon's saying here if you don't get deeper in to God they'll never come forth the manifestation of his life inside of us now that's the way it is today we claim to be the bride of Christ we claim we're the bride and if we are the bride we're to bring forth children hmm now that is that statement shows responsibility there's no excuse for any of us God is looking for us to manifest him and to take this word and to share it with somebody to bring forth Christ run bride run run with this word run with the message run with this word rededicate yourself don't be afraid of making a commitment to Christ don't be afraid of vowing to be more faithful a lot of times we don't do that because we're just afraid that we won't be able to keep it and you know what you'll always feel that way talk to some of the old-timers but you still got to do it you got to say boo back to the devil you you've got to say I am one of the few I am the bride I can live this word I can do all things through Christ you strengtheneth me and you've got to run this race you can't sit with laodicea you got to run it don't be afraid of reading your Bible more time that's right afraid to get into church on time amen what's that that's a half hour before service so you can pray don't be afraid of putting God first in our homes what does that really mean Brother John that means take the Bible is your road map you wherever that Prophet taught let it be the order of your home run bride run the devil's after you be sober be vigilant because your adversary the devil as a wrong line walketh about seeking whom he may devour the devil will try to divide you away from the body he will try to divide you away from one another man said in the message to Paradox he says how are we going to lose this great race it's because we're divided remember they were in the upper room one mind one Accord how we going to do it he says we've got to stay together we're all believers in God the Holy Ghost takes us all in it'll be a paradox if God ever gets us together but he will that's the bride I can see the foolish virgins being divided but the bride will not be come on the bride will not be divided he said just trust him he knows how to send persecution that will run us together you know persecution sends some this way and sends some this way yeah persecution look what it did to the to the disciples when persecution came right they all went out doing the will of God spreading the gospel but they were they were together they were together in their purpose yes yes they were fulfilling the word of God Romans chapter 13 verse 11 says and that knowing the time that now is high time to awake out of our sleep that's a spiritual sleep for now is our Salvation nearer then when we first believed now this stumps a lot of people because some people think that they were salvation is when they got baptized but it's it's actually it's not to the end that's just the beginning no no that's strong but we need to run we need to keep running we need to keep running that we may obtain oh if we die before then and we're running that's it but the scripture says for now is our Salvation nearer than when we first then when we believed the night is far spent the day is at hand let us cast off the works of darkness just lay aside every weight and let us put on the armor of Jesus Christ let us walk honestly as in the day not rioting drunkenness not in chambering and wanting not in strife and envy but put ye on the Lord Jesus Christ and make not provision for the flesh to fulfill the lust thereof this is the hour that we need to run bride run run home run into his arms don't stop running away from your situation and start running to Christ with all your heart put Christ on the name of the Lord is a high tower and the righteous run into it and are safe I believe the bride is running to the arms of Christ she sheltered in the arms of Christ brother Brandon said in the message earnestly continued for the faith that was once delivered to the Saints he said when Rebecca seen Isaac she jumped off the camel and run to meet him it was love at first sight I think part of it is we're not getting our eyes enough on our Isaac amen we need to keep our eyes on him the author and the finisher of our faith we need to run this race amen lay aside every weight and the sin that does so easily beset us let us lay aside I think that's what brother Brandon said when he went on to the over on over the curtain of time and he came back he said he said whatever you do lay aside everything else until you get perfect love lay aside brother John I got a lot of stuff going on look I'll be honest with you brother Branham didn't come to call a foolish virgin out of the church he was called to get a bride out of the church this word isn't for everybody but I say to the bride lay aside everything else until you get perfect love because that's what will make it in there run run in the message choosing of a bride brother branches flee to him don't let the devil ever cool you off from this stay right with it until your everyone filled with the Holy Ghost now it's not a period it's a comma because I want us to get this part for those of us that have the Holy Ghost in so much that will make you come to this word that will make you women straighten up and will make you men straighten up if you say you've got the Holy Ghost and won't cope with the word it's another Spirit In You God's spirit is on his word the Messiah the anointed word the bride now listen to this the bride must be a messiah the anointed word he said we must become the word the only way we'll become the word we've got to get serious about our walk with him and start laying things aside that we we don't think is important they are important now we're compassed with so great a cloud of witnesses the Bible says there's been saints that have gone on salt asunder they've stood the test they went through the Lion's Den they've they've been uh to the uh the the belly of the whale as it were they've they've stood the test that God gave them and yes this age is harder than those it's a harder time we're living in because of this lukewarm spirit this you can do whatever you want to do it doesn't matter because we have to actually deny that our flesh hungers for that and we have to deny that but we are compassed with so great a cloud of witnesses are looking on and we've seen them go on so now we are encouraged to lay aside the things the weights that get in their way that are holding us down I don't know if if any of you ever done this but I used to play hockey and be when I would get ready I would wear weights on my legs heavy weights and I'd walk and I'd go through school and I'd walk and I'd run and I'd Jog and I'd have all this weight and then when those weights fell off man I could just fly and that's what happens when you get rid of sin when you get rid of unbelief you just free your light is a feather you can you can fly as Eagles there were the where the carcasses there where the Eagles be gathered together now I'll tell you God has given us joy the joy of the Lord is our strength and the Bible says um consider him he endured the cross because of the joy that was set before him he was able to finish the race because of the joy now if we don't have joy we don't seem to have any strength to do the things that we heard today we need Joy the Bible says that in his presence is the fullness of joy not just a little bit but a fullness of joy so we need to press into Christ to get that joy to to run this race the way it needs to be run not limping along in wheelchairs not barely making it but we need to run it like the weights are off of us so we can pass up this old man amen let's Stand Together are you with me amen let's keep running bride let's keep running the race is almost over I want to hear him say Well done thou good and faithful servant amen and I'll be honest with you I don't feel I don't feel that that's already targeted for my name I don't feel that I don't feel I don't ever feel that I'm going to feel that I remember you know brother Brandon talking about just I I hope having that Spirit of I hope that I I hear those words and I just say we need that fear and trembling to keep pressing with all of our heart amen let's sing the message of his coming that's in
