[33:41] you turn with me in your Bibles to
[33:43] Revelations chap
[33:47] 12 uh I want to say thank you to each of
[33:51] you that been that prayed for us when we
[33:53] were

[33:59] we we don't get to always go very often
[34:02] and get away but uh it wasn't until we
[34:05] got away that we realized that we needed
[34:08] to get
[34:10] away we you just keep going and going
[34:13] and going and uh you get that little
[34:16] time it takes you just a few days just
[34:18] to
[34:20] unwind and I appreciate your prayers
[34:22] hope this morning something could be
[34:24] said to help us along the way amen let's
[34:28] look to the Lord in a word of prayer
[34:30] before we read his
[34:32] word Lord we thank you for this precious
[34:34] opportunity that we could be here this
[34:36] morning to worship you and to praise you
[34:40] as we have to sing these songs of Zion
[34:42] to express our love to you our gratitude
[34:46] Lord for the
[34:50] blood Lord that you have called us out
[34:53] of the world
[34:55] into your kingdom we thank thank you for
[34:58] that today we thank you that we could be
[35:01] together with brothers and sisters that
[35:02] believe the same the same thing
[35:05] Lord this this word of God from cover to
[35:09] cover now Lord as we uh enter into the
[35:15] word this morning we pray that we would
[35:17] have that that same love that same
[35:22] worship that same yearning to express
[35:27] our with Thanksgiving for your word
[35:29] today bless your word to our hearts
[35:32] Lord let us glean from it Lord what we
[35:36] need that we might be better
[35:39] Overcomers we'll be careful to praise
[35:41] you for all these things now we pray
[35:43] them in Jesus Christ's name amen amen
[35:47] Revelations chapter 12 starting with
[35:49] verse number nine and the Great Dragon
[35:52] was cast out that old serpent called the
[35:54] devil and Satan which deceiveth the the
[35:57] whole world he was cast out into the
[36:02] Earth and his angels were cast out with
[36:05] him I heard a loud voice saying in
[36:08] heaven now is come salvation and
[36:13] strength and the kingdom of our God and
[36:15] the power of His Christ for the accuser
[36:20] of the Brethren is cast down which
[36:24] accuse them before our God day day and
[36:28] night and they overcame him by the blood
[36:31] of the Lamb by the word of their
[36:33] testimony and they love not their lives
[36:35] unto death unto the death therefore
[36:39] Rejoice ye
[36:41] heavens and ye that dwell in the earth
[36:44] woe to the inhabitants of the earth and
[36:47] of the sea for the Devil is come down
[36:49] unto you having great wrath because he
[36:53] knows he has but a short time amen God
[36:58] bless the reading of this word and bless
[37:00] you this morning as you're seated amen
[37:02] we want to entitle this message
[37:04] overcoming evil and if I could say that
[37:06] this message is going to be threaded
[37:08] with how the bride will overcome
[37:11] evil it's not just you know one quick
[37:14] thing
[37:15] but there's a lot to
[37:18] it and uh I believe we need all the
[37:22] word and we need to be in the center I
[37:25] like that this church is on Center Road
[37:29] it's it's in the center of the word it
[37:31] doesn't lead to one side or the other
[37:33] side it's I believe it has a good
[37:37] balance evil is all around
[37:40] us and the devil knows he has but a
[37:42] short
[37:43] time and he's coming down and he's
[37:47] attacking and if we understand the
[37:50] scriptures he's coming after the bride
[37:52] more than
[37:54] anybody it's true because they have more
[37:57] more truth than
[38:02] anyone and he's also called the accuser
[38:05] the brother so every time we get
[38:07] thoughts that are acquisation thoughts
[38:10] against
[38:11] us we understand that they're from the
[38:15] devil and we can get those thoughts
[38:17] right at
[38:19] church it's true but sometimes we're not
[38:23] spiritual enough to discern where
[38:25] they're coming from
[38:27] I mean if they're from God brother
[38:29] brandham says if you can't say Amen say
[38:32] oh
[38:33] me you know we we just got to take sides
[38:36] but sometimes we got to call out the
[38:38] devil call him
[38:41] out he's he's come to
[38:45] battle he knows he has but a short time
[38:48] he's only he's going to work very hard
[38:50] now he doesn't know who's who
[38:53] totally totally he doesn't know who
[38:56] seed but he knows who's trying who's in
[39:00] the message who's listening to the
[39:02] tapes and uh we just got to get our
[39:05] boxing gloves on and get ready to fight
[39:08] amen evil is on the rise in the world
[39:10] today faster than ever
[39:13] before I believe it's come out of the
[39:15] closet and it's right in our face
[39:17] now Jesus said as it was in the days of
[39:20] lot so shall it be in the coming of the
[39:23] son of man so you couldn't go spend the
[39:26] evening inside
[39:27] without your door being broken down
[39:29] because of
[39:31] perversion you can't go anywhere without
[39:34] seeing it you just drive up to a
[39:35] drive-through window and it's staring
[39:36] right in your face you can't turn
[39:38] anything on the TV without it being
[39:41] right there in your face just like it
[39:43] was in the times of
[39:45] Sodom Jesus said as it was in the days
[39:47] of Noah so shall it be in the coming of
[39:50] the son of
[39:51] man and we know at that time God saw
[39:54] that the wickedness of man was great in
[39:56] the Earth and that every imagination of
[39:59] the thought of his heart was only
[40:02] evil
[40:04] continually so we've got to overcome the
[40:07] evil that's in our thoughts in our
[40:10] minds evil has escaped how it's it's
[40:13] roaming throughout the Earth it's
[40:16] devouring everything in its pth it's
[40:17] almost like a a tornado or that a
[40:21] hurricane a
[40:24] barrel Evo has pushed the envelope open
[40:27] every aspect of the world there's never
[40:30] been a greater manifestation of evil
[40:32] than there is today I just read that
[40:35] there are currently 56
[40:39] conflicts the most since World War
[40:42] II and they have become more
[40:45] International that
[40:47] 92 countries are involved in conflicts
[40:51] outside of their own
[40:53] borders
[40:55] wow Jesus has prophesied in the in the
[40:58] end times that there's many that are
[41:00] going to be offended and betray one
[41:02] another and and shall hate one another
[41:04] and if if we're living here and we're in
[41:06] this room we've all experienced being
[41:09] betrayed we've all been we've all
[41:12] experienced when somebody has hated
[41:15] us we're living in that hour it's
[41:19] increased I would you like to to go to a
[41:22] church where there's there's hatred
[41:26] inside and even
[41:32] inside know this that in the last days
[41:35] perilous time shall
[41:36] come right in the church men are lovers
[41:39] of their own self Covetous bols proud
[41:43] blasphemers unthankful Unholy right in a
[41:46] holy church amen without natural
[41:49] affection truth Breakers I'm going to do
[41:51] this but don't false accusers just
[41:54] accusing others just so they can feel
[41:56] better in incontinent fears despisers of
[41:59] those that are good always have
[42:01] something to say with somebody's trying
[42:03] to do the right thing amen traitor heady
[42:07] high-minded lovers of their own desires
[42:10] more than lovers of
[42:11] God that's the hour that we're living
[42:14] with this is evil all around
[42:18] us that evil is not only reigning in the
[42:21] world it's not only reigning in the
[42:22] church it wants to have preeminence in
[42:25] our worldly nature right
[42:29] and Paul said in Romans
[42:31] 719 for the good that I would do I do it
[42:36] not but the evil that I would not do
[42:39] that I end up
[42:41] doing now if I do that I would not it is
[42:46] no more I but sin that dwelleth in me so
[42:49] now he's he's making it clear that when
[42:51] I would I I I if I I'm doing evil it's
[42:55] really not my desire it's something else
[42:57] inside of me that's making me do it I
[43:00] find then a law that when I would do
[43:03] good evil is present with
[43:09] me James said from whence cometh these
[43:11] wars that are inside of
[43:13] Us come they not even of your lust that
[43:16] war in your members so we're not
[43:19] fighting against people we're not
[43:21] fighting against uh flesh and blood but
[43:23] we're fighting against Spirits inside of
[43:26] people and I'll say it like like this a
[43:28] lot of times we don't even recognize the
[43:30] devil coming into our own
[43:32] mind but that's where the battle starts
[43:35] he says you lost and you have not you
[43:37] kill and you desire to have you cannot
[43:39] obtain you fight in war and you have not
[43:41] because you ask not you ask and you
[43:44] receive not because you ask a miss that
[43:46] you may consume it upon your lust so
[43:47] here the the people in the church are
[43:50] are are literally having this confusing
[43:53] relationship with God that they want God
[43:55] for what they they're flesh once amen
[43:59] it's not a relationship that is just
[44:01] pure honest with
[44:04] God crazy
[44:07] relationship and he says you adulterers
[44:09] and adulteresses know you not that the
[44:11] Friendship of the world is an enemy with
[44:16] God so whosoever therefore will be a
[44:19] friend of the world is an enemy of God
[44:21] now that that's that is that's
[44:25] scary I don't want to in God's wrong
[44:28] side do you think the scripture saith in
[44:30] vain the spirit that dwelleth in US it
[44:33] lusteth to Envy evil wants to rule in
[44:38] our worldly nature and we've got to
[44:40] overcome it what a battle right inside
[44:43] of us right wrong good and evil it's
[44:46] starting to develop right inside of our
[44:49] minds and sometimes we don't know but
[44:51] what is the fruit of it it causes
[44:54] confusion yes where at one time we had
[44:56] con convictions about something now we
[45:00] don't that's what it
[45:02] does confusion James said for where envy
[45:07] and strife is there is confusion and
[45:10] every evil work amen I don't know how
[45:13] much you pay attention to the problems
[45:16] that develop in your relationships in
[45:19] your homes in your work but it usually
[45:21] just takes one thing for the devil to
[45:23] start
[45:25] something and so as he starts something
[45:28] you're talking about 15 different things
[45:31] but it was only one thing to start with
[45:34] the devil knows what he's doing because
[45:36] the more he can get in there the more he
[45:38] can put a wedge in there the less we can
[45:40] solve this
[45:42] problem now how do I overcome this
[45:46] evil well we read a three-fold purpose
[45:49] the blood of the Lamb the word of their
[45:51] testimony and they love not themselves
[45:54] to death it's not just one thing and you
[45:57] just can't say well every time I just
[45:59] plead the blood and that's it in order
[46:02] for the blood to keep working in your
[46:04] life you've got to walk in the
[46:08] light because if brother BR says God is
[46:10] not a obligated to show you anything
[46:12] more if you haven't done what he's asked
[46:14] you to do how can you get the benefits
[46:16] of the
[46:17] blood if you think about it if you just
[46:19] claim the blood anytime you could just
[46:21] live a life full of sin claim the blood
[46:22] at the end and everybody would be
[46:25] saved so in order to stay under the
[46:27] blood we've got to walk in the light
[46:29] we've got to pay attention to the word
[46:30] that's being ministered to
[46:32] us and the word of their testimony now
[46:35] that just doesn't mean your private
[46:37] testimony what that means is you have a
[46:39] word
[46:41] testimony your life is is you believe
[46:44] the word you're holding to the promises
[46:46] of God if the if the Bible says greater
[46:48] is he that's in me than he that's in the
[46:50] world then that's that's your testimony
[46:53] if if if the word says I can do all
[46:55] things through Christ and that's your
[46:57] testimony you your testimony has to be
[46:59] the word of God it can't be anything
[47:04] else and and don't you love
[47:08] yourself there's no room for yourself no
[47:12] room for your will and it can't be you
[47:15] know you had to do that when you gave
[47:17] your life to Jesus
[47:18] Christ yes you had to walk in the the
[47:22] light of I'm wrong I Repent I give my
[47:25] life to you
[47:27] you had to do that at the beginning but
[47:29] the Bible says unto your death in other
[47:31] words every day you follow the
[47:33] scriptures when Jesus said I uh that we
[47:37] deny ourselves daily Paul says I Die
[47:41] daily and this scripture is telling us
[47:43] the key to overcoming evil is to deny
[47:47] ourself because it gets in the way the
[47:49] Lord is my shepherd I shall not want
[47:53] amen there is evil battling right now
[47:56] inside of
[47:58] us and there's evil battling inside the
[48:02] whole entire
[48:03] world you ever wonder why there's so
[48:06] much evil why has God allowed
[48:08] evil why is evil growing and increasing
[48:12] and waxing worse and worse now why is it
[48:15] why is God allowed that well none of us
[48:18] want it what is the purpose of allowing
[48:21] evil brother brandom said straight As
[48:23] the gate he said the tree of Good and
[48:25] Evil is set before every
[48:28] person so we could say oh you know it's
[48:31] terrible what Eve
[48:32] did but you know what the tree is
[48:35] sitting right there in front of us amen
[48:38] that's right since the Fall In the
[48:40] Garden of Eden man has had Evil all
[48:43] around them the Bible says that we were
[48:46] we were born in sin and we were
[48:49] shapen in iniquity iniquity actually
[48:52] shapen us into a life of iniquity
[48:57] Evil's always been around
[49:00] us but we know evil started in heaven
[49:04] God allowed it to Rome throughout
[49:08] Heaven while he was there he allowed it
[49:11] to be
[49:13] there he allowed it in order to manifest
[49:17] who was the true angels and who was not
[49:19] the true
[49:22] Angels who was going to stay with God's
[49:24] Will and who was going to choose choose
[49:27] to do their own
[49:29] will I wonder if that's why evil is
[49:32] allowed to be around us
[49:35] today God has allowed the tree of evil
[49:38] the tree of
[49:40] death right inside the Garden of Eden he
[49:43] had this perfect garden but he allowed
[49:46] the tree of evil to be there and God has
[49:50] allowed evil to be everywhere from the
[49:53] beginning even in the church we're
[49:57] engaged in the greatest battle ever
[49:59] fought Satan is here trying to keep us
[50:02] from receiving the word of
[50:06] God Isaiah 45:
[50:10] 5-7 the Bible says I am the lord and
[50:13] there is none else there is no God
[50:16] beside me I GED thee though thou has not
[50:21] known me that they may know from the
[50:24] rising of the Sun from the West that
[50:26] there is none beside me I am the lord
[50:28] and there is none else that's
[50:31] right and he said I form the
[50:36] light and create
[50:39] Darkness I make peace yes I create evil
[50:45] I the Lord do all these
[50:49] things the Lord knows what he's doing we
[50:54] don't have to be afraid of evil amen
[50:57] perfect love will cast out all
[51:00] fear but if we don't respect the word of
[51:04] God evil can overtake
[51:07] us come
[51:09] on brother BR said in the message
[51:11] adoption part two he said God at the
[51:14] beginning before an angel was ever made
[51:18] how many knows he's infinite he is
[51:19] infinite he is God so God In His
[51:22] Infinite Mercy he saw that Lucifer he
[51:25] saw that Lucifer would would do that if
[51:27] he created this he'd put them onto a
[51:30] Freemore agency that basis and you're
[51:33] still there right there the tree of
[51:36] right and wrong set before every one of
[51:38] us amen and you make your choice and
[51:42] Lucifer was the first one to take the
[51:44] wrong road and he began to draw after
[51:47] him hogish h o g g
[51:51] i trying to take all for himself try to
[51:55] override somebody else and that's what
[51:59] where it started now listen to this
[52:02] that's where sin began in his infinite
[52:09] mind God has allowed evil to be set
[52:13] before each and every one of us for his
[52:16] purpose as much as we wish evil was not
[52:20] around he uses it for a purpose he
[52:23] worketh the Bible says everything after
[52:25] the counsel of his own will
[52:28] right it's here to stay we've got to
[52:31] accept it we' we've got to accept evil
[52:35] is here to stay it will stay till we're
[52:38] out of here yes now he wants his
[52:41] seed that's us to resist evil and to
[52:45] overcome
[52:47] it and that's all evil that's set before
[52:51] them we must face it and resist it we
[52:54] must face it and overcome it yes don't
[52:58] don't turn don't ignore it don't let it
[53:01] be in your home come on don't let it be
[53:04] in your mind don't let it be in your
[53:09] conversation if we yield to evil it will
[53:12] influence our Christian walk evil has a
[53:15] great power to influence Christians we
[53:18] are told Romans 6:16 that to whom you
[53:21] yield yourself servants to obey his
[53:23] servant you are to whom you obey whether
[53:25] to sin and to death or of obedience unto
[53:28] righteousness so the the very FL of of
[53:30] what you you you yield yourself to
[53:33] whether it's evil or good that's what's
[53:35] going to
[53:36] Prevail so if we walk with the carnal
[53:38] mindset the Bible says we cannot be
[53:42] subject to God the B the Bible says the
[53:45] mind the carnal mind cannot be subject
[53:47] to God Amen it just cannot be no matter
[53:50] if we're in church no matter if we're
[53:51] reading the Bible no matter if we're
[53:53] praying we got to get rid of a carnal
[53:55] mindset
[53:57] the Bible says if we walk in the flesh
[53:59] we'll end up biting and devouring one
[54:01] another yes am evil has a great power of
[54:06] influence on us as Christians many
[54:09] Christians have been derailed and
[54:12] started following the easy way because
[54:14] of this influence they've got distracted
[54:17] they've lost their Vision they've
[54:19] separated from loving God and got
[54:21] disconnected from the
[54:23] vine evil has influenced many to serve
[54:27] God in their own way instead of God's
[54:30] way and that's why we got so many
[54:32] different churches and denominations and
[54:34] beliefs because people want to serve God
[54:37] their own way now I don't want to serve
[54:40] God my way because I know my way does
[54:43] not bring
[54:45] joy it does not bring peace amen it does
[54:49] not bring
[54:50] freedom in fact my way has always led to
[54:54] bondage has always led to dis
[54:56] disappointment and
[54:58] sorrow uh it is by the grace of God that
[55:02] he shows us his way now once he shows us
[55:05] his way it there's where our heart comes
[55:08] in and says I Will Follow The Way of the
[55:11] Lord now we're in a great battle good
[55:13] and evil right or wrong it's all set
[55:16] before us but evil seems to be winning
[55:19] the battle as a
[55:22] whole this is kind of quiet I we should
[55:25] have a couple more amens with that one
[55:26] I'm thinking there's a great Falling
[55:31] Away there's an apostasy right inside
[55:33] the church there's mockers saying that
[55:37] everything seems to be the same
[55:39] nothing's any different where's the
[55:41] coming of the Lord there is a decrease
[55:45] in
[55:47] Christianity people love staying home
[55:50] instead of going to
[55:52] church God has allowed this evil to
[55:56] remain here until he
[55:58] returns it's taking everything over
[56:02] except one group of people right and
[56:05] that's his
[56:07] bride that is the only group that will
[56:10] overcome the only group that will not be
[56:13] deceived the only group that will not
[56:16] love themselves the only group that will
[56:18] be faithful the only group that does
[56:21] stay under the blood because they're the
[56:22] only group that's walking in the light
[56:25] it's the only group that has a testimony
[56:28] that it's the word of God and nothing
[56:30] but the word of God for their lives it
[56:32] is the only group that will prevail over
[56:36] all evil yes so we must overcome evil or
[56:42] it will overcome
[56:45] us now we could enjoy all the things
[56:49] that life can give
[56:51] us but if evil still is over us what
[56:55] good would it be in the end so we're
[56:58] talking this message can only make sense
[57:01] if we're thinking about eternal life
[57:04] amen now Jesus told the people in our
[57:06] age to him that overcometh will I grant
[57:10] to sit with me in my Throne you can't
[57:13] even be with God in his throne unless
[57:15] you're an overcomer right so we've got
[57:18] to come to face with this this message
[57:21] even as I also overcame and have sat
[57:24] down with my father in his he had to
[57:27] overcome see he was flesh and blood too
[57:30] he all he said if it's possible let this
[57:32] cup pass from me I don't want to die out
[57:35] to myself call you know what about
[57:37] calling 12 Legions of angels He could
[57:40] have done that if he wanted
[57:42] to he had to
[57:47] overcome and because he overcame the
[57:49] Bible says be of good cheer right I have
[57:53] overcame you can overcome because the
[57:55] over lives inside of
[57:59] us now he that have an ear let him hear
[58:02] what the spirit is saying unto the
[58:04] churches that's the key right
[58:07] there all right I want to overcome evil
[58:10] Romans 12: 211 tells us how to do it be
[58:14] not overcome of
[58:16] evil but overcome evil with
[58:20] what good well there's a there's a
[58:23] revelation in that right there when
[58:26] you're facing evil when you're dealing
[58:29] with with temperatures that are rising
[58:33] or wrath or or uh thoughts of of
[58:38] acquisation about others are coming into
[58:40] your mind when when things are going all
[58:45] wrong around you the only way to
[58:48] overcome it is with
[58:51] good now I'm just going to say this
[58:54] there's only one thing that's good
[58:55] that's
[58:57] God the only way to overcome evil is
[59:01] with God Amen it's only thing that can
[59:04] overcome
[59:07] evil we've all had stories where evil
[59:10] has showed its face and we had to make a
[59:12] choice of how we were going to act we'
[59:15] probably all experienced some sort of
[59:17] road rage when somebody you know cut us
[59:19] off or did something a little wrong to
[59:22] us on while we were
[59:24] driving we got a little bothered
[59:27] come on am I going to have church by
[59:29] myself today or we going to have it
[59:31] together we had to make a choice amen
[59:35] when someone speaks evil of you behind
[59:37] your back but but never seems to have
[59:40] enough Holy Ghost to say I'm sorry and
[59:42] make it right we've all had to
[59:45] experience that what what are we going
[59:46] to do with that like does it really
[59:49] matter if they say sorry it doesn't what
[59:52] really matters is that you can forgive
[59:54] them that's what really matters what are
[59:57] you going to
[59:59] do some people don't even know how to
[1:00:02] turn the cheek or go the Second Mile
[1:00:04] without some sort of
[1:00:08] complaining see evil is all around
[1:00:12] us 1 Peter chapter 2 chter 3:8 says
[1:00:16] finally be ye of all be ye all of One
[1:00:20] mind of course that's the mind of Christ
[1:00:23] having compassion one of another mother
[1:00:26] love as true
[1:00:29] Brethren be pitiful be courteous be
[1:00:32] polite be respectful be con consider it
[1:00:34] be
[1:00:36] friendly not rendering evil for
[1:00:43] evil well because they gave me the cold
[1:00:45] shoulder next time they want me I'm
[1:00:48] going to remember
[1:00:50] this not rendering see you're not going
[1:00:53] to overcome evil with evil that's right
[1:00:56] railing for
[1:00:58] railing but contr wise blessing knowing
[1:01:02] that you are there un to called see the
[1:01:05] Bride is a different
[1:01:07] calling that you should inherit a
[1:01:10] blessing amen you react totally
[1:01:12] different with evil you always show good
[1:01:16] you overcome the sit did you know that
[1:01:18] that's the love of God that covers a
[1:01:20] multitude of sin amen amen it isn't you
[1:01:23] explaining how wrong they were
[1:01:26] it isn't about you talking about how
[1:01:29] wrong they were it's about you learning
[1:01:31] how to cover Hallelujah I'm so glad that
[1:01:35] Jesus covered my sins you know he didn't
[1:01:37] go around into heaven and talk to all
[1:01:39] the angels and say what do you think
[1:01:40] about
[1:01:43] this come on who do we think we are to
[1:01:47] sit there and talk about somebody
[1:01:49] else not rendering evil for
[1:01:54] evil not an eye for an eye a tooth for a
[1:01:58] tooth be not overcomed of evil that's
[1:02:01] what that
[1:02:03] means I'm gonna I'm gonna I'm gonna I'm
[1:02:06] gonna hold this I'm gonna I'm gonna what
[1:02:09] are you gonna
[1:02:10] do what are you going to do you're going
[1:02:12] to be overcomed of evil with a carnal
[1:02:15] mindset of fighting and arguing and and
[1:02:18] not just being genuine in your
[1:02:21] heart but overcome evil with good turn
[1:02:25] the cheek
[1:02:27] go the second M love your enemy do good
[1:02:29] to them that hate you pray for them who
[1:02:33] despitefully use you well brother John
[1:02:35] nobody has done that in a while they
[1:02:37] will you get close to human beings and
[1:02:40] you try helping them and you will get
[1:02:44] used you know that's why some of us
[1:02:46] don't want to get close to anybody
[1:02:47] because we're afraid of being used I'll
[1:02:49] tell you what you ought to have more of
[1:02:50] the love of God in your heart come on I
[1:02:53] believe that I believe you ought to be
[1:02:55] so full of the love of God that nothing
[1:02:57] could stand in your way from helping
[1:03:01] somebody you're not your own you're
[1:03:04] bought with a
[1:03:06] price verse 10 for he that will love
[1:03:09] life and see good days let him reframe
[1:03:14] his tongue from evil notice where the
[1:03:18] evil is is the
[1:03:21] tongue and his lips that they speak no
[1:03:27] no deceit no decoys no
[1:03:31] tricks no put on just be
[1:03:38] real let him excute
[1:03:42] evil and do good let him pursue
[1:03:47] peace and ensue it seek peace and ensue
[1:03:50] it get a hold of
[1:03:53] it Peter is calling
[1:03:56] evil what comes out of our tongue and
[1:04:00] our lips but refrain from it decline
[1:04:04] from it stop evil right
[1:04:08] inside how many times have we just
[1:04:11] wanted to try to straighten things out
[1:04:13] make things right prove the other person
[1:04:15] that they're wrong and when we do we
[1:04:18] slip up and evil comes
[1:04:20] out so there's a way to do that and the
[1:04:25] the Bible says you do it with
[1:04:29] good we need a greater power than evil
[1:04:32] to overcome
[1:04:33] evil and that can only be God Amen it's
[1:04:38] not saying I have God in my
[1:04:41] life it's not saying I adure Thee by
[1:04:43] Jesus Christ who Paul preacheth
[1:04:46] we must become one with
[1:04:49] God and we must remain in that state of
[1:04:53] Oneness this is a a real uh like I said
[1:04:56] this message is really threaded with how
[1:04:58] to be an overcomer how to overcome evil
[1:05:01] because too many people think that since
[1:05:03] I gave my life to Jesus Christ
[1:05:05] everything is sold up no it's
[1:05:09] not now Jesus said in my name you shall
[1:05:11] cast out
[1:05:14] Devils but Jesus said also that many
[1:05:16] shall come to me in that day and say
[1:05:19] Lord Lord didn't we cast out
[1:05:21] Devils so it's not just
[1:05:25] having power of Christ in your life but
[1:05:29] notice these people in the last days
[1:05:33] they don't get to partake of of
[1:05:37] Heaven uh they don't get to partake of
[1:05:39] the Rapture let me just say this because
[1:05:42] they never overcame evil inside of
[1:05:47] themselves yeah it's much easier to cast
[1:05:50] out a devil out of somebody than to cast
[1:05:52] The Devil out of your own lust amen
[1:05:56] amen they didn't stay
[1:05:59] connected they didn't stay under the
[1:06:01] blood the word of God did not remain
[1:06:04] their
[1:06:05] testimony and they ended up loving
[1:06:08] themselves like Lucifer
[1:06:10] did they walked in
[1:06:12] [Music]
[1:06:14] iniquity the Bible says in 2 Timothy
[1:06:17] 3:13 but evil men and Seducer shall wax
[1:06:20] worse and worse deceiving and being
[1:06:24] deceived Satan is deceiving the whole
[1:06:26] world he's he's blinded the minds of
[1:06:30] them that do not believe notice if we
[1:06:34] just believe God will open our
[1:06:36] eyes churchgoers are getting stuck in
[1:06:42] leoda my Believers of God who once
[1:06:47] depended on God are now having an
[1:06:51] attitude why I don't need to do anything
[1:06:53] more than I'm doing
[1:06:57] they don't want to listen to
[1:06:59] you they don't need you to share any
[1:07:02] more light with them they don't want you
[1:07:05] telling them what they can
[1:07:06] do they've lost interest pressing
[1:07:10] towards the Mark or the statue of a
[1:07:13] perfect man at one time they were
[1:07:15] pressing into that and after a while the
[1:07:17] battle became so hard so they just kind
[1:07:19] of laid back and put it on cruise
[1:07:22] control I want you to know I have
[1:07:25] nothing to say negative about any single
[1:07:29] person but understand this this is how
[1:07:31] God feels about the
[1:07:34] person who isn't putting their awe into
[1:07:41] Christ he said I would rather have you
[1:07:44] serving the
[1:07:47] devil exactly what he said I'd rather
[1:07:50] have you hot or
[1:07:54] cold than to be
[1:07:56] lukewarm God that God hates
[1:08:00] lukewarmness I mean we we should never
[1:08:02] just be trying to be comfortable because
[1:08:05] that spirit is what's overtaking us to
[1:08:09] pressing
[1:08:11] in so we need to recognize the enemy
[1:08:15] trying to get us just to
[1:08:17] be you know half in and half out I don't
[1:08:22] want to be half in and half out I want
[1:08:25] to know where I'm standing with God if
[1:08:27] you're half in and you're half out I'm
[1:08:29] just telling you God would have you just
[1:08:31] just choose just choose and it didn't
[1:08:33] matter if you don't love him he's okay
[1:08:35] with
[1:08:37] that but don't don't don't come halfway
[1:08:42] that is that's such a slap in his face
[1:08:45] he he he died for you and you only want
[1:08:48] to give him half of your heart he gave
[1:08:50] you all of his heart and you only want
[1:08:51] to give him
[1:08:54] half amen Jesus called the church in our
[1:08:57] age wretched miserable poor blind and
[1:09:01] Naked Brother bam said the God of this
[1:09:03] evil age he says now look at the day
[1:09:05] that we're living in when he's calling
[1:09:07] out a bride he's got a church that
[1:09:12] claims to be doing good when it's
[1:09:15] Evil by denying the word now this is
[1:09:19] what I'm saying you know we may come to
[1:09:21] church and we may set in a message
[1:09:23] church and we may say we're are
[1:09:24] believers of the and time message but
[1:09:26] when you come to church and you hear the
[1:09:28] word and you do not take that word home
[1:09:29] and begin to practice it that is evil in
[1:09:32] the sight of
[1:09:35] God it is you're denying the
[1:09:39] word they overcame them by the word of
[1:09:43] their testimony we've got to be
[1:09:45] determined we should always leave the
[1:09:47] church with a greater determination to
[1:09:50] obey the word that we just
[1:09:52] heard if that is not there get that
[1:09:54] thing fixed
[1:09:55] get it fixed don't don't wait till the
[1:09:57] next service just get that thing right
[1:10:00] because if you don't start right you
[1:10:01] don't end right now we have a
[1:10:05] responsibility as the evil is waxing
[1:10:07] worse and worse we have the
[1:10:09] responsibility of overcoming evil with
[1:10:12] good and that means we need to make
[1:10:14] better
[1:10:15] choices better decisions amen we need to
[1:10:19] we need to choose to put God first we
[1:10:21] need to choose to do good when evil is
[1:10:24] right there in our face and we don't
[1:10:26] like
[1:10:27] it and you know you don't even have to
[1:10:30] go to you don't even have to be taught
[1:10:32] by Mom and Dad or anybody in the world
[1:10:34] how to render evil for
[1:10:37] evil when we're in the world somebody
[1:10:40] crossed you at school you just want to
[1:10:42] beat that boy
[1:10:43] up and the girls want to beat the girls
[1:10:46] up right and and the brothers wanted to
[1:10:49] beat this other brothers up in their
[1:10:52] home you don't got to be taught that but
[1:10:55] as we we're learning that Christ is not
[1:10:58] like that and we can't wait for just a
[1:11:01] good circumstance so mom's doing good
[1:11:03] the children are doing good everything's
[1:11:05] work's doing good the money's coming
[1:11:07] everything's good so you know what I'm
[1:11:09] just going to practice Christianity
[1:11:11] now we don't practice Christianity when
[1:11:14] everything's good we've got to overcome
[1:11:17] evil and we've got that responsibility
[1:11:19] whether we like it or
[1:11:20] not we've got to
[1:11:23] choose the right
[1:11:27] things you know sometimes we got to make
[1:11:29] church family a
[1:11:33] priority that's
[1:11:35] right our God family a priority our
[1:11:40] brothers and sisters a
[1:11:42] priority you know I think you know
[1:11:45] sometimes we become a little selfish and
[1:11:47] the only thing we think about is
[1:11:50] us I think we need to practice laying
[1:11:53] down our life for one another
[1:11:56] that doesn't mean do something out of
[1:11:58] your abundance don't give out of the
[1:12:00] abundance but hurt yourself to help
[1:12:03] somebody come on start with sacrificing
[1:12:07] some time in prayer praying for somebody
[1:12:10] a little bit longer than you would want
[1:12:14] to if you believe that God lives in you
[1:12:17] then let's start activating that
[1:12:22] power John said 1 John 4:4 ye are of God
[1:12:27] little children and have overcome them
[1:12:30] what is them evil spirits you've
[1:12:32] overcome the evil spirits because
[1:12:35] greater is he that is in you than he
[1:12:39] that is in the
[1:12:41] world no doubt every one of us believe
[1:12:43] God's inside of
[1:12:46] us and everyone also believes that the
[1:12:50] devil can get inside of us because we
[1:12:53] step back and we say why did I do that
[1:12:55] I'm sorry
[1:12:57] Lord now here's the thing there's this
[1:13:00] battle and we've got to be an overcum we
[1:13:03] cannot take the attitude of well we're
[1:13:06] all Sinners we all make mistakes you
[1:13:09] know none of us are perfect what are you
[1:13:11] doing you're building yourself a little
[1:13:13] web to lay
[1:13:16] in how about God not only sees me as
[1:13:19] Overcomer but I have such a desire to
[1:13:22] show him I'm an overcomer
[1:13:25] how about that love in our heart to want
[1:13:27] to manifest
[1:13:30] Christ you know a lot of times when
[1:13:32] somebody's mad or upset at us did
[1:13:34] something wrong you know we're so mad at
[1:13:36] them we don't even care about helping
[1:13:38] them come on it's true we want to prove
[1:13:42] the wrong and that's about all we want
[1:13:44] to
[1:13:45] do but there ought to be such a love in
[1:13:47] our heart that we want to help
[1:13:49] somebody in order to really help them
[1:13:52] you got to get yourself out of the way
[1:13:53] and you've got to love them
[1:13:55] right amen now Christ is our source of
[1:13:59] strength to overcome all
[1:14:02] things and if Christ is our source of
[1:14:05] strength then we must remain connected
[1:14:08] to that source of strength of all at all
[1:14:10] times have you ever been in the presence
[1:14:12] of God just had a wonderful time in his
[1:14:15] presence and I'll tell you maybe 15
[1:14:19] minutes half hour hour later you end up
[1:14:22] doing something that you know was not
[1:14:25] God right and you wonder what
[1:14:30] happened you didn't stay
[1:14:33] connected and so I want to talk about a
[1:14:35] subject just for a little bit that I
[1:14:37] think is so often
[1:14:39] confusing because we've accepted God in
[1:14:41] life because we've got salvation because
[1:14:44] we're in the message there's that
[1:14:46] tendency to think that we are never
[1:14:48] disconnected from
[1:14:52] God and this is what I'm saying this can
[1:14:54] be
[1:14:55] this this is a subject that can be very
[1:14:59] mixed up but I'm telling you the prophet
[1:15:02] taught us that at any time that we
[1:15:04] grieve the Holy Spirit which we
[1:15:06] shouldn't be doing but we can that we
[1:15:09] that that that the Holy Spirit Has Its
[1:15:12] Right to leave us until we get that
[1:15:14] thing
[1:15:16] right so at that time when that's
[1:15:18] happening and I think it happens a lot
[1:15:20] more than what we
[1:15:21] realize that there is a disconnection
[1:15:24] that's taken in place now we are still
[1:15:26] Gods we are still the seat of God we
[1:15:29] still belong to God but we we're not
[1:15:32] doing what we should be doing at that
[1:15:35] time turn with me if you would to John
[1:15:38] chapter 15 John chapter 15 I want to
[1:15:41] read the first seven verses there Jesus
[1:15:43] speaking in John 15 I am the True Vine
[1:15:46] and ye and my father is the husband men
[1:15:50] every man every branch in me that
[1:15:53] beareth not fruit he take taketh it
[1:15:57] away now notice the branch is already in
[1:16:04] him there it's there's already a
[1:16:09] connection they're already
[1:16:12] part but he's making this strong
[1:16:15] statement that every branch in me that
[1:16:17] beareth not fruit he's going to take it
[1:16:21] away and every branch that is bearing
[1:16:24] fruit
[1:16:25] he's going to end up pruning some of it
[1:16:29] that for a purpose that he would see
[1:16:32] more
[1:16:33] fruit we we might look at God and say
[1:16:35] he's not very
[1:16:37] satisfied but he is one that wants to
[1:16:39] bring out the most of us the best of us
[1:16:44] he wants to see more than what he's
[1:16:46] seeing I I love that knowing that's the
[1:16:49] nature of
[1:16:51] God now ye are clean through the word
[1:16:55] which I've spoken unto you right if you
[1:16:58] allow the word to correct you you become
[1:17:03] clean and I love that abide in me and I
[1:17:08] in
[1:17:09] you as the father cannot bear fruit as
[1:17:13] the branch cannot bear fruit of itself
[1:17:17] except it abide in the vine and no more
[1:17:21] can you except you abide in me so how in
[1:17:25] the world are we going to overcome evil
[1:17:28] when we're not
[1:17:30] connected when we're going through the
[1:17:32] course of the day we did our little
[1:17:33] prayer we we read our our little
[1:17:35] scripture for the day and we just shoot
[1:17:37] on the day and we expect that we're just
[1:17:39] going to overcome evil when it slaps in
[1:17:42] our in our face that we're just going to
[1:17:44] not we're going to react
[1:17:46] right A relationship is more than just a
[1:17:50] little prayer in the morning a little
[1:17:51] reading of the word it's it's a
[1:17:53] relationship
[1:17:56] every relationship that you have you
[1:18:00] want you want respect out of that
[1:18:04] relationship but you also want that
[1:18:07] person that you have a relationship with
[1:18:09] I don't care if it's the mailman I don't
[1:18:11] care who it is you want them to be true
[1:18:15] and loyal to you is that the truth can
[1:18:19] you say Amen to that amen you want
[1:18:22] that everybody does
[1:18:25] God wants
[1:18:28] that and to whom much is given much is
[1:18:31] required amen so here we are we're with
[1:18:35] a god whose mind is to prune us a little
[1:18:38] bit more to get a little bit more fruit
[1:18:40] out of us and tells us that we got to
[1:18:42] stay connected to him or else it's not
[1:18:45] the relationship's not going to work can
[1:18:48] you say amen amen all right let's
[1:18:50] continue reading now he said I am the
[1:18:53] vine you are the branches he that
[1:18:55] abideth in me and I in him the same
[1:19:00] bringeth forth much fruit for without me
[1:19:03] you can't bear fruit right you can't be
[1:19:06] longsuffering you can't turn the cheek
[1:19:09] you can't love when somebody's hating
[1:19:11] you you just can't do
[1:19:14] it if a man abide not in me he is cast
[1:19:19] forth as a branch and is withered and
[1:19:24] Men God gather them and cast them into
[1:19:26] the fire and they are
[1:19:28] burned if you abide in me and my words
[1:19:32] abide in you ye shall ask what you will
[1:19:36] and it shall be done unto you now that's
[1:19:38] a
[1:19:40] promise the thing is I think there's too
[1:19:42] many trying to claim the promise without
[1:19:44] abiding in
[1:19:46] Christ trying to claim something without
[1:19:49] doing what God has asked of the
[1:19:52] relationship abiding with him now here
[1:19:55] in is my father glorified that ye bear
[1:19:58] much fruit so shall ye be my disciples I
[1:20:03] I believe that if we abide in Christ
[1:20:06] that is how we're going to overcome evil
[1:20:08] we've got to stay connected in if I
[1:20:11] could say it like this not connected to
[1:20:14] your
[1:20:15] salvation not connected to
[1:20:19] um uh being saved going to heaven but
[1:20:23] staying connected into a relationship
[1:20:25] now we all have relationships right
[1:20:27] every one of us have some sort of
[1:20:29] relationship our the the the young
[1:20:32] people here they have relationship with
[1:20:34] their
[1:20:35] teachers and if if you just if if you
[1:20:39] follow the instructions you will find
[1:20:41] favor with the with the teacher amen but
[1:20:44] you don't do your homework you act wrong
[1:20:46] in class you're causing trouble you want
[1:20:49] to be the goofy guy of the day I am
[1:20:51] telling you you're going to find that
[1:20:53] you're not finding faith favor in that
[1:20:56] relationship so you've got to stay
[1:20:58] connected to
[1:21:00] Christ I will say of the Lord he is my
[1:21:03] strength he is my shield he is my my
[1:21:06] buckler my defense my refuge my safety
[1:21:09] my strong tower he is my shelter I am
[1:21:12] connected to him he's my comor my
[1:21:15] counselor my City of Refuge he is My All
[1:21:18] In All
[1:21:23] right because that's relationship I have
[1:21:25] with them the only way to overcome evil
[1:21:29] is to stay connected to Christ stay
[1:21:32] connected in the vine it's not just an
[1:21:36] imaginary relationship that we have with
[1:21:39] God it should be one that we present our
[1:21:43] bodies a Living Sacrifice unto God the
[1:21:47] Bible says which is our a reasonable
[1:21:50] service to not be conformed to the evil
[1:21:54] that's in the world but to be
[1:21:55] transformed by the renewing of our minds
[1:21:57] that we could present
[1:22:00] ourselves and prove what is that good
[1:22:04] and perfect and acceptable will of God
[1:22:07] see now we know we know people that are
[1:22:12] not in the message that are not in the
[1:22:14] truth that say they have a relationship
[1:22:17] with
[1:22:18] God and a and they do all kinds of bad
[1:22:21] things and they think it's okay
[1:22:25] but you know what we've been given the
[1:22:27] word we should be able to take our life
[1:22:30] in this word and prove what is the the
[1:22:33] perfect will of
[1:22:34] God what is the only will that's
[1:22:37] acceptable to him what is the only will
[1:22:40] that he considers to be a good
[1:22:42] will it's
[1:22:45] God so we're
[1:22:47] challenged if we're risen with Christ to
[1:22:50] pres to to seek those things which are
[1:22:53] above
[1:22:55] to set our affections on things
[1:22:57] above to stay connected to the vine you
[1:23:01] know sometimes we have to pray longer
[1:23:03] than we want to
[1:23:04] pray we may have to stay at the altar a
[1:23:07] little bit longer than the last song
[1:23:09] that we
[1:23:11] sung We may have to cry out for the Holy
[1:23:14] Ghost to show up a little bit longer
[1:23:16] than we want to am if we want to stay
[1:23:20] connected to the vine we've got to take
[1:23:22] time to set our affections on things
[1:23:24] above don't try to fit it in on two
[1:23:28] Services he is a rewarder to them that
[1:23:31] diligently seek
[1:23:34] him God doesn't take Delight in part-
[1:23:38] timr those who show up for church when
[1:23:41] it's convenient and they don't even take
[1:23:44] the word home they leave him there when
[1:23:46] they leave
[1:23:48] church David said blessed is the man
[1:23:50] that walketh not in the counsil of the
[1:23:52] ungodly nor standeth in in the way of
[1:23:54] Sinners nor sth in the seat of the
[1:23:56] scornful but his Delight is in the law
[1:23:59] of the Lord and in his word doth he
[1:24:03] meditate day and night can you say Amen
[1:24:07] to that and he shall be like a tree
[1:24:10] planted by the rivers of water that
[1:24:12] bringeth forth his fruit in his season
[1:24:15] and his Leaf shall not wither and
[1:24:17] whatsoever he
[1:24:18] does you notice it prospers yes amen
[1:24:23] that's where I want to be amen where I'm
[1:24:25] not there I want to be there am where
[1:24:28] I'm not prospering where I don't have
[1:24:30] what the Holy Ghost says I I need to
[1:24:33] have that's where I want to
[1:24:36] be we got to stay connected to Christ

[1:24:50] dealing with keep your relationship up
[1:24:54] to date in other words whatever God has
[1:24:56] spoken to you in the past may it be
[1:24:59] important to you so important that you
[1:25:01] take care of it

[1:26:28] loving themselves unto the death they
[1:26:32] didn't just say at the beginning when
[1:26:34] you gave your heart to Christ but we got
[1:26:36] to continue to recognize that our
[1:26:39] greatest enemy is

[1:27:46] young that we were not able to have
[1:27:49] certain privileges until our
[1:27:51] responsibilities were done right maybe
[1:27:53] our homework maybe our
[1:27:56] chores all of us you know we couldn't
[1:27:58] eat our dessert until we ate our
[1:28:01] food right and if we want all things to

[1:28:06] the kingdom of God first amen stay
[1:28:09] connected keep seeking God first in your
[1:28:12] life each day we make choices to stay
[1:28:16] connected or we make the choice that
[1:28:18] we're going to handle life with our best
[1:28:21] ability our attitude has everything to
[1:28:23] do with overcoming the circumstances in
[1:28:26] our personal
[1:28:27] life Jesus wants us he's allowed evil to
[1:28:31] stay here Jesus wants us to live in this
[1:28:34] world with evil all around us and he
[1:28:37] wants us to choose to overcome the evil
[1:28:41] think about
[1:28:43] that and he gives us a lot of
[1:28:45] opportunities doesn't he yes he does
[1:28:48] amen and we overcome it by the power of
[1:28:51] God John Jesus said in John 17 14 I have
[1:28:55] given them Thy word and the world have
[1:28:57] hated them because they are not of the
[1:29:00] world even as I am not of the world I
[1:29:02] pray not that thou should us take them
[1:29:03] out of the world where all that evil is
[1:29:06] right but that thou should us keep them
[1:29:10] from the evil amen God's desire is to
[1:29:15] keep us from the
[1:29:17] evil God has a plan for his elect bride
[1:29:20] to keep us from the evil as if
[1:29:25] increasing I believe we need to be
[1:29:27] increasing with Christ 1 Peter chapter 1
[1:29:32] verse 5 the Bible says who are kept by
[1:29:36] the power of God through faith unto
[1:29:41] salvation ready to be revealed in the
[1:29:43] last time wherein you greatly Rejoice
[1:29:46] though now for a season if need be ye
[1:29:49] are in heaviness through manifold
[1:29:50] Temptations amen that the trial of your
[1:29:53] faith being much more precious than gold
[1:29:56] that perishes though it be tried with
[1:29:58] fire might be found un the praise and
[1:30:00] honor and Glory at the appearing of
[1:30:03] Jesus Christ we are kept by the power of
[1:30:08] God through faith amen you know the
[1:30:11] Bible says God dwells in our heart by
[1:30:13] faith if you don't believe it he's not
[1:30:16] there the moment you think well where
[1:30:19] did God
[1:30:21] go each day we must remember we got to
[1:30:25] do our part we got to make the right
[1:30:27] decisions in order to stay connected we
[1:30:29] got to choose not just the first day I
[1:30:33] choose to serve the Lord remember when
[1:30:35] you made that decision I'm going to
[1:30:37] choose to serve the Lord I remember
[1:30:40] making that
[1:30:41] decision I
[1:30:43] remember calling my
[1:30:47] girlfriend when she was up at
[1:30:50] Central and I told her I've made a
[1:30:53] decision
[1:30:55] I'm going to start serving
[1:30:56] God and I'll never forget that decision
[1:31:00] now we all had a lot of ups and downs
[1:31:03] since that choice that we made and I
[1:31:06] believe if we are not careful to make
[1:31:09] that decision every single day choose to
[1:31:11] serve the Lord every day that we're
[1:31:13] going to get tripped up by
[1:31:16] evil we can't go on yesterday's
[1:31:18] experience to hold us today we can't we
[1:31:22] can't now we can build off of that
[1:31:25] that we can keep that but we can't
[1:31:29] ignore that we need more of God because
[1:31:32] evil is
[1:31:33] increasing that means we need more of
[1:31:36] the Holy Ghost so every day we must
[1:31:38] choose the fight the good fight of Faith
[1:31:41] to lay hold of the promises of God to
[1:31:44] take the whole armor of God to to lay
[1:31:47] aside the the the weights the sins that
[1:31:50] so easily beset
[1:31:52] us you get time to read Ephesians
[1:31:55] chapter 6 13-18 it tells you about the
[1:31:58] whole armor of God Amen each day we must
[1:32:01] choose to maintain a god centered
[1:32:05] attitude right Paul said let this mind
[1:32:08] be in you that was in Christ Jesus
[1:32:10] brother Ram said the right mental
[1:32:13] attitude towards any Divine promise of
[1:32:15] God will bring it to pass that's how
[1:32:17] important the right attitude is start
[1:32:20] with the right mindset the right
[1:32:21] attitude choose to be an over
[1:32:25] Comer I want us to begin to seek more of
[1:32:29] the Holy Ghost I'm I am so honestly I am
[1:32:32] so I don't like using the word proud but
[1:32:35] I am so proud of all the holy ghost that
[1:32:39] I see in your lives I am because the
[1:32:43] only way that has happened is because
[1:32:45] you
[1:32:46] chose more of
[1:32:50] God now there is more for us to have and
[1:32:52] I believe that we're going to need to be
[1:32:55] so full of the Holy Ghost in order to
[1:32:57] overcome all evil in this age
[1:32:59] yes Jesus said you shall receive power
[1:33:02] after the Holy Ghost has come upon you
[1:33:05] so you have the promise when you seek
[1:33:07] more Holy Ghost you're automatically
[1:33:10] going to get more power and when you got
[1:33:11] more power you
[1:33:13] know it's easy to
[1:33:16] overcome
[1:33:18] right it if you did not have any money
[1:33:24] to buy dinner you have no
[1:33:28] power if you didn't have any gas in your
[1:33:30] car you couldn't drive
[1:33:33] it if you have no Holy Ghost if you're
[1:33:36] if you're not keeping that fresh if you
[1:33:38] if you're not yield in yourself if if
[1:33:41] you're not staying connected then you
[1:33:42] don't have the power to
[1:33:45] overcome first Peter or second Peter 1:3
[1:33:50] says that it is God's divine power
[1:33:54] that gives us all things that pertaineth
[1:33:56] unto life and
[1:33:58] godliness it's the holy ghost that what
[1:34:01] is what we need whereby are given unto
[1:34:06] us exceeding great and precious promises
[1:34:09] that by these we might be
[1:34:12] partakers of the divine nature yes
[1:34:15] having escaped the corruption that is in
[1:34:17] the world through
[1:34:19] lust now if you were going to invite me
[1:34:21] over your house to have dinner I just
[1:34:23] want to stop there and think about that
[1:34:25] for a
[1:34:26] minute but if you were to invite me over
[1:34:29] for dinner and you made your delicious
[1:34:32] dinner I would and I I I took a scoop
[1:34:37] out of the bowl and I put it on my plate
[1:34:39] and I began to taste it I would be
[1:34:43] partaking of your
[1:34:47] dinner now it is the promises of God
[1:34:50] that we have right here that we believe
[1:34:52] in Christ dwells in our heart by faith
[1:34:55] that if we can believe that Christ is in
[1:34:59] us the more of the nature of Christ that
[1:35:03] we can get in the more that we can
[1:35:06] escape escape the lust that's in this
[1:35:09] world that's what the Bible
[1:35:12] says having escaped the corruption that
[1:35:15] is in the world through lust how do we
[1:35:17] excape it by getting more of God's
[1:35:20] nature that's how we escape it we don't
[1:35:22] learn to be better
[1:35:26] Christians it's not through some
[1:35:28] education that we become a better
[1:35:31] Christian it's through the power of God
[1:35:33] living inside of us that's how we become
[1:35:36] better
[1:35:38] Christians as we partake of God's nature
[1:35:42] we will escape the evil nature now God
[1:35:46] is looking for character just please
[1:35:48] bear with me just a little bit longer
[1:35:51] God is looking for character
[1:35:56] thank you brother M thank you brother
[1:35:58] Ron some out there is knowing what I'm
[1:36:00] looking for and
[1:36:02] amen he's going to marry
[1:36:06] character now character is having power
[1:36:09] to do your own will but choosing to do
[1:36:14] God's just in Simplicity what character
[1:36:17] is brother brandham said power without
[1:36:21] character is satanic in other words you
[1:36:23] have free more agency you can do what
[1:36:25] you want uh but you you can do what God
[1:36:29] wants but you choose to do what you want
[1:36:31] to do so anybody who exercises their own
[1:36:34] will is really exercising a satanic
[1:36:38] power and don't even realize
[1:36:39] it amen amen now brother brandom said
[1:36:44] character is not going to be gifted to
[1:36:46] us it's not a gift but rather it's a
[1:36:49] victory in order to have a victory you
[1:36:52] have to overcome something
[1:36:55] you have to overcome you have to
[1:36:57] overcome we actually have to fight for
[1:37:01] something if we're going to get
[1:37:04] character so allow evil to be around you
[1:37:07] don't be bothered by it don't say well I
[1:37:09] hope he she don't act like this and he
[1:37:11] don't act like this and my boss isn't
[1:37:13] like this and my kids aren't like this
[1:37:16] don't worry about anything don't fear
[1:37:19] anything because God in you is greater
[1:37:22] than anything that you'll
[1:37:24] face that's what character is I can
[1:37:27] overcome this situation I can make a
[1:37:32] difference character is the power to
[1:37:35] choose God's will over your own in the
[1:37:38] middle of a
[1:37:42] Temptation 1 John chapter 5:4 says but
[1:37:46] whatsoever is born of God overcometh the
[1:37:51] world and this is the victory that
[1:37:53] overcometh the world even our
[1:37:57] faith don't expect God to just flood you
[1:38:01] with
[1:38:02] victories evil is set there so you can
[1:38:05] take your the faith that you have in the
[1:38:07] word of God and face it and overcome it
[1:38:10] with
[1:38:13] good and I'll say it like this if you
[1:38:16] truly believe that you're born
[1:38:19] again the Bible cannot
[1:38:22] lie you will
[1:38:26] overcome there is one group that will
[1:38:29] overcome all
[1:38:31] things and that's those who've been
[1:38:33] completely born
[1:38:36] again
[1:38:38] completely therefore If any man be in
[1:38:41] Christ he's a new creature old things
[1:38:43] are passed away behold All Things become
[1:38:45] new and all things are of God I know for
[1:38:49] us that got busy schedules this is a
[1:38:51] hard thing to to comprehend that God
[1:38:53] really wants to be that much in our life
[1:38:55] but he
[1:38:57] does the new birth is a continuation of
[1:39:01] the manifestation of Christ in our life
[1:39:04] I just if you can remember this the rest
[1:39:07] of your life the new birth is a
[1:39:09] continuation of the manifestation of
[1:39:11] Christ in life you can't just say oh I
[1:39:13] was born again
[1:39:16] then if you were born again then you're
[1:39:19] still born
[1:39:20] again and and and to me
[1:39:24] if God gives you another year God
[1:39:26] expects you to manifest more of
[1:39:29] him so it is a continuation of Christ in
[1:39:33] our
[1:39:34] lives we can't get
[1:39:38] away we will be Overcomers because the
[1:39:41] word of God cannot lie every seed brings
[1:39:44] forth of its
[1:39:47] kind the Bible says not the Bible but
[1:39:50] brother Bram said in the message God of
[1:39:52] this evil age is I'm close in now the
[1:39:54] humble little bride of Christ just
[1:39:57] simply believes the word whoever she is
[1:40:00] it's individuals I hope and trust that
[1:40:05] there's many sitting present many
[1:40:08] listening in and I hope that
[1:40:12] myself and every one of you all are a
[1:40:16] part of that
[1:40:17] bride I hope
[1:40:20] many and it will all that's been
[1:40:24] ordained to that will be that because
[1:40:30] it's their
[1:40:32] nature their
[1:40:35] nature I think it's it's important for
[1:40:38] us to focus on the
[1:40:41] nature not so much what we think feel
[1:40:46] believe up here but how we act how we
[1:40:51] handle how we overcome evil with good
[1:40:55] that
[1:40:56] nature
[1:40:58] amen praise the Lord let's Stand
[1:41:09] Together keep your
[1:41:14] testimony stay
[1:41:20] connected choose him every day
[1:41:24] doesn't mean you're not going to mess up
[1:41:26] you will mess up but what it means is
[1:41:29] you'll get up quick you'll say I'm
[1:41:32] sorry I don't care if you do it five
[1:41:34] times 10
[1:41:36] times if Jesus expects us to forgive
[1:41:39] 7times 70 I believe he forgives us
[1:41:42] 7times
[1:41:44] 70 stay connected stay in love the Bible
[1:41:47] says keep yourselves in the love of
[1:41:50] God stay connected to him let's sing
