[35:15] they shall be ashes under the soles of
[35:17] your feet and the day that i should do
[35:19] this
[35:20] saith the lord of hosts
[35:22] remember ye the law of moses my servant
[35:25] which i commanded unto him in horeb for
[35:27] all israel with the statutes and
[35:30] judgments
[35:31] behold i will send you elijah the
[35:33] prophet before the coming of the great
[35:35] and dreadful day of the lord and he
[35:37] shall turn the hearts of the fathers to
[35:39] the children and the heart of the
[35:41] children to their fathers lest i come
[35:44] and smite the earth with a curse
[35:47] amen
[35:48] let's just bow our heads
[35:50] dear lord jesus we're
[35:52] we're grateful lord that we can stand
[35:54] together
[35:55] father tonight and and read the words

[36:08] but lord we know that you are that
[36:10] bearer of our burdens
[36:12] lord jesus we lay our our burdens at
[36:16] your feet father
[36:17] and we know that you are faithful
[36:20] you are faithful and true
[36:22] and father everything is done lord that

[36:27] bless brother marty sister kathleen
[36:29] bless the family those that are left

[36:34] to them
[36:35] and tonight lord may you be merciful to
[36:37] us
[36:38] lord we're just
[36:40] we're just
[36:42] dirt
[36:44] we're just here father
[36:46] lord you put a spirit in us
[36:49] and lord
[36:51] your blood cleansed us and you changed
[36:53] us and lord jesus we just pray that
[36:55] you'll be merciful tonight and that you
[36:58] just come and break the bread of life
[37:00] lord may you just feed us

[37:03] understanding lord that we might glorify
[37:05] you in all things
[37:07] in jesus christ's name we ask it amen
[37:10] amen you may be seated praise the lord
[37:12] amen amen
[37:15] most all of us should know malachi
[37:18] 4 5 and 6.
[37:20] but
[37:21] there
[37:22] there is a lot in malachi 4.
[37:26] it's good to know that the book of
[37:28] malachi
[37:29] it was the last of the prophecies to the
[37:32] restored remnant that was after the
[37:35] 70-year captivity in babylon
[37:38] and it was during the time of nehemiah
[37:40] and ezra and the repairing and the
[37:42] rebuilding of jerusalem and the
[37:44] restoration of the temple worship
[37:47] it was during that time that these
[37:49] prophecies were given
[37:51] and it's very important to know that
[37:54] because if you know that
[37:56] then you can understand the attitude
[37:59] later on when we get into other details
[38:02] and start looking at things then
[38:04] the things that are written in the book
[38:06] are
[38:07] become very
[38:09] enlightening
[38:11] so the space of time between malachi and
[38:14] the birth of christ is about 400 years
[38:17] so
[38:18] the
[38:19] the patriarchs through the ages martin
[38:22] luther and wesley and and knox and
[38:25] finney and all these ones that you know
[38:27] because the scriptures was written
[38:29] originally all written in the new
[38:31] testament was written in greek and then
[38:33] of course it was translated into latin
[38:35] and then the people never got to see it
[38:37] because the priests understood latin but
[38:39] the common people didn't know latin
[38:41] so we thank the lord that god one day he
[38:44] he went and translated it into a
[38:46] language that we could understand
[38:48] why am i telling you that because the
[38:51] book of malachi which is only four
[38:52] chapters and it is the last book in the
[38:55] old testament that god chose to preserve
[38:59] that book for this age
[39:02] he chose to choose that there was
[39:04] probably many other minor prophets or
[39:06] other people that they could have put in
[39:08] the book
[39:10] but malachi is put in there amen amen
[39:14] malachi 4 has three distinct parts in it
[39:18] the first part is verse 1.
[39:21] so we'll just read this again so that so
[39:23] it says for behold the day cometh that
[39:26] you'll burn as an oven and all the proud
[39:28] yea and all that do wickedly shall be
[39:30] stubble and that day that cometh shall
[39:33] burn them up saith the lord of hosts
[39:35] that it shall leave them neither root
[39:36] nor branch
[39:38] so verse one is the first
[39:40] part the second part is but unto you
[39:44] that fear my name shall the son of
[39:46] righteousness arise with healing in his
[39:48] wings and ye shall go forth and grow up
[39:50] as calves of the stall and ye shall
[39:53] tread down the wicked for they shall be
[39:55] ashes under the souls of your feet in
[39:57] the day that i shall do this saith the
[39:59] lord of hosts remember ye the law of
[40:01] moses my servant which i commanded unto
[40:04] him in horeb
[40:06] for all of israel with its statutes and
[40:08] judgments that's the second part and
[40:12] then the third part is behold i will
[40:14] send you elijah the prophet before the
[40:16] coming of the great and dreadful day of
[40:17] the lord and he shall turn the heart of
[40:19] the fathers to the children and the
[40:21] heart of the children to the fathers
[40:23] lest i come and smite the earth with a
[40:25] curse
[40:26] amen
[40:28] so verse 1
[40:30] it talks about he says says so behold
[40:33] the day cometh that you'll burn as an
[40:35] oven and all the proud yea and all that
[40:37] do wickedly shall be stubble
[40:40] and the day that cometh shall burn them
[40:42] up saith the lord of hosts and it shall
[40:44] leave them neither root nor branch
[40:46] i mean i don't really want to be here
[40:47] for that
[40:50] but god right away
[40:52] he starts speaking in the other parts he
[40:56] says but unto you that fear my name
[41:00] but means
[41:01] before that happens you that fear my
[41:04] name i will do something
[41:07] when you look at verse 5 and 6 he says
[41:10] behold i will send you elijah the
[41:12] prophet before the coming of the great
[41:14] and dreadful day of the lord
[41:16] so i kind of
[41:17] i agonized over this i thought well
[41:19] maybe maybe the verses are out of order
[41:23] but you got to understand
[41:25] so when nehemiah and ezra when they came
[41:27] out of babylon they came down and the
[41:29] city was ruined the walls were knocked
[41:32] down the temple was burnt to the ground
[41:34] and everything and when nehemiah you if
[41:36] you go back and study the book of
[41:38] nehemiah and ezra you'll find out
[41:39] because ezra was the priest but nehemiah
[41:42] was the governor who was trying to
[41:43] rebuild the walls and while they were
[41:46] there and they were doing that people
[41:48] rose up to fight with them about
[41:51] restoring the city
[41:53] so during this time malachi comes and
[41:55] says behold the day cometh that the
[41:58] world is going to burn up like a flaming
[42:01] fire so it wasn't unusual for them to
[42:04] hear that because they could look around
[42:06] and see the evidence of that
[42:08] the city was destroyed
[42:10] so they're looking at that and and they
[42:12] thought what another battle's coming
[42:16] amen
[42:18] another battle's coming
[42:19] so we want to take a look here let's now
[42:22] there's many many many scriptures that
[42:24] talks about the day of the lord but we
[42:26] want to go to daniel 12
[42:29] we're just going to look at at two
[42:31] settings in the scriptures
[42:33] otherwise we'll be here for weeks
[42:36] we don't want to do that
[42:38] if you look at daniel 12 verse 4 it says
[42:42] but thou o daniel shut up the words and
[42:45] seal the book even to the time of the
[42:47] end
[42:48] many shall run to and fro and knowledge
[42:50] shall be increased
[42:52] and daniel looked and said and behold
[42:55] there stood another two one on this side
[42:57] of the bank of the river and one on the
[42:58] other side of the bank of the river and
[43:00] one said to the man clothed with linen
[43:03] which is upon the waters of the river
[43:05] how long shall it be to the end of these
[43:07] wonders
[43:08] so daniel at the end of his life
[43:11] he sees these visions he sees these
[43:13] prophecies and he asks god a legitimate
[43:16] question
[43:18] when will this be
[43:21] when will be that end of it
[43:23] and i heard a man clothed in linen that
[43:25] was upon the waters of the river when he
[43:27] held up his right hand and his left hand
[43:29] unto heaven and swear by him that liveth
[43:31] forever and ever that it should be for a
[43:33] time times and a half and when he shall
[43:35] have accomplished to scatter the power
[43:37] of the holy people all these things
[43:39] shall be finished
[43:41] and i heard but i didn't understand
[43:44] well i'm glad you told me that but i
[43:47] don't know what it means
[43:49] so we asked god again oh my lord when
[43:52] shall be the end of these things
[43:55] and he says sorry daniel
[43:58] it's not for you
[44:00] the words are closed up and sealed till
[44:03] the time of the end
[44:05] so the only clue that we have in daniel
[44:08] 12
[44:09] is verse 4
[44:11] where he tells him to shut up the words
[44:13] seal the book even to the time of the
[44:16] end
[44:17] and when the time of the end comes
[44:19] many shall run to and fro
[44:21] and knowledge shall be increased
[44:24] now
[44:25] don and i the other night were watching
[44:27] an old john wayne movie and they were
[44:29] flying from hawaii to san francisco
[44:32] and they were flying in a dc-8
[44:35] and they had 3 400 gallons of fuel
[44:40] and it was going to take them 12 and a
[44:41] half hours
[44:43] and they only flew at 9000 feet
[44:46] i said wow that's hardly you can almost
[44:48] jump up 9000 feet
[44:51] and then we compared it with today
[44:54] and today you can fly from hawaii to san
[44:56] francisco in five and a half hours and
[44:58] it sets at 600 miles an hour at 37 000
[45:01] feet
[45:03] so they shall run to and fro
[45:05] we can travel the world i'm always
[45:07] amazed i'm amazed at the power of this
[45:11] phone
[45:13] i can call somebody in africa and they
[45:15] pick up
[45:19] and then i can facetime them and
[45:20] actually see them without it going
[45:23] i mean it's actually quite good
[45:27] so he says
[45:29] the only two clues i'm going to give you
[45:31] about the time of the end
[45:32] is that many will run to and fro
[45:36] and that knowledge shall increase
[45:39] that's the only clue i'm giving you
[45:41] daniel
[45:43] now
[45:44] here's the disciple here's here's the
[45:47] the issue so to speak
[45:50] malachi prophesies
[45:52] and then
[45:53] everything goes on
[45:55] like it always has
[45:58] they expected maybe you know the king of
[46:00] assyria or the king of persia they
[46:02] expected somebody to come up and just
[46:05] burn the place back down to the ground
[46:06] so they were looking for that because
[46:09] malachi was a vindicated prophet
[46:11] otherwise the book wouldn't be in the
[46:12] bible but it is there
[46:15] and so 400 years god was silent
[46:20] and at the end of the 400 years
[46:23] jesus christ came on the scene
[46:26] and it was so their expectation every
[46:29] time that god started to move and they
[46:31] recognized the move of god was they were
[46:33] looking for behold the day of the lord
[46:35] is at hand he's going to burn this place
[46:37] up
[46:39] because that was the last thing that god
[46:42] told through a prophet to his people
[46:45] amen
[46:47] so we find out then that through the
[46:49] life of jesus the disciples continually
[46:52] were saying are you going to set up the
[46:53] kingdom now are you going to set up the
[46:54] kingdom now
[46:55] when can i be the leader when can this
[46:57] one be the leader i'm the greatest and
[46:59] when are you going to run the romans out
[47:01] and everything else and they were all
[47:02] the jews were looking for that but it
[47:05] never happened
[47:08] when he went to calvary it was a shock
[47:12] because it was not what they had thought
[47:14] out
[47:16] it was just a shock to them
[47:18] and we but we find
[47:20] that god was not without a witness
[47:22] because i want you to go to ii peter 3
[47:28] praise the lord amen
[47:34] amen
[47:37] when we go to ii peter 3
[47:41] and we go down here to verse 10
[47:43] it says but the day of the lord will
[47:46] come as a thief in the night
[47:48] amen
[47:50] which the heavens
[47:51] shall pass away with a great noise and
[47:54] the elements shall melt with the fervent
[47:56] heat and the earth's also and the works
[47:58] that are therein shall be burned up and
[48:00] that's exactly malachi 4 1.
[48:04] he's quoting malachi 4 1. amen
[48:08] and he says when this happens
[48:11] seeing then that all of these things
[48:13] should be dissolved what manner of
[48:15] persons ought we to be in all holy
[48:18] conversation and godliness amen and we
[48:21] know that holy conversation means holy
[48:23] living amen not just about what we talk
[48:26] about but
[48:27] we know
[48:28] god is going to destroy the world
[48:31] by fire
[48:33] and we know that according to daniel's
[48:35] prophecy
[48:36] that we're getting close to the season
[48:40] amen
[48:41] amen
[48:44] brother branham and super sign he says
[48:45] but you see now what happened all at
[48:48] once
[48:49] 6 000 years has been the same man
[48:53] but right here in the last 50 years he's
[48:55] come from a horse to a buggy to a jet to
[48:58] a rocket
[49:00] i mean it is absolutely amazing if you
[49:04] spend just a little bit of time
[49:06] looking at how much the world changed
[49:10] from the civil war
[49:11] all the way up to the first world war
[49:15] how much it changed after the beginning
[49:17] of the of the 19th century
[49:20] how much it changed when electricity i
[49:22] mean they entered into the 1900s with
[49:26] gas kerosene lights and whale oil lights
[49:30] and coal fires and everything else and
[49:32] within just a very very very short time
[49:37] electricity started going up around
[49:38] everywhere
[49:40] after a very short time somebody was
[49:43] able to make a telephone and talk 25
[49:45] miles which they thought that was great
[49:48] because that's a lot better than writing
[49:49] a letter
[49:51] it was such a short time that things
[49:55] started to happen very quickly and in
[49:57] super saiyan brother branham said you
[49:59] need to take a notice of that
[50:02] he says only in the last 50 years so he
[50:04] was this was in 1962.
[50:06] he says only in the last 50 years he's
[50:08] come from a horse and buggy to eject
[50:12] and then a rocket why
[50:14] the bible said that they would run to
[50:17] and fro in the last days and knowledge
[50:20] shall increase it's a sign of the end
[50:23] time
[50:24] now we all believe
[50:27] that this is the end time
[50:29] but if you can't set it in the
[50:31] scriptures then you're just guessing
[50:34] everybody's just guessing you know the
[50:36] the
[50:37] we're going to see that later on the
[50:39] disciples the scribes the pharisees
[50:42] everybody was guessing but when they
[50:43] could place it right in the scriptures
[50:45] then we have thus saith the lord amen
[50:48] amen
[50:50] so i want you to notice that the world
[50:52] was going in a breakneck speed just fast
[50:54] fast fast creation making things making
[50:57] things making things making things
[50:59] making things and then in 1945
[51:02] some men got into god's
[51:04] cabinet
[51:06] and they came out with a bomb
[51:08] and their biggest concern was if we drop
[51:11] this bomb
[51:13] what will stop it
[51:15] will the reaction start and it won't
[51:18] stop
[51:20] will it fulfill malachi 4 1.
[51:25] amen
[51:28] in 1945 they had never they had just
[51:31] they had done it scientifically in the
[51:33] lab they had calculated it out
[51:35] mathematically and everything else but
[51:37] they didn't even know if it was going to
[51:39] blow up when they dropped it at
[51:40] hiroshima
[51:43] but when they dropped it
[51:47] everybody even to this day
[51:50] is terrified of nuclear war
[51:56] you i the russians ukraine i don't care
[51:59] who they are i see they're they're
[52:00] bombing the nuclear power plant as we
[52:03] speak which is like okay
[52:06] we're all afraid in nuclear power do you
[52:08] notice
[52:09] god stopped them
[52:14] he stopped him
[52:17] he demonstrated
[52:18] malachi 4 1
[52:21] and then he stopped him
[52:26] let's go back to malachi 4.
[52:32] so we see that verse 1
[52:35] talks about the day the last day when
[52:38] god will come and finally clean
[52:41] this filthy world up he's going to
[52:42] completely clean it off there are so
[52:45] many i mean there's so much
[52:48] but
[52:49] we only have so much time and our brains
[52:50] can only handle so much so i went
[52:52] through and said nope can't do that
[52:53] can't do that can't do that can't do
[52:54] that
[52:57] so but we can do this we know the day
[53:00] cometh that it shall burn as an oven
[53:03] verse 2 says but don't be don't you be
[53:06] afraid
[53:08] verse 2 says
[53:10] don't don't you be afraid
[53:13] because you fear
[53:15] go ahead put the second verse up on the
[53:17] screen he says but unto you that fear my
[53:20] name
[53:22] the son of righteousness
[53:25] shall rise with healing in his wings and
[53:27] ye shall go forth and grow up as calves
[53:30] of the stall
[53:31] and you shall tread down the wicked for
[53:33] they shall be ashes under the soles of
[53:35] your feet in the day that i shall do
[53:37] this saith the lord of hosts
[53:40] remember ye the law of moses my servant
[53:42] which i commanded unto him in horeb for
[53:45] all israel with the statutes and the
[53:47] judgments
[53:48] amen
[53:50] now i just did a little quick
[53:53] google
[53:54] on the internet
[53:56] and i put in healing revival
[53:59] so verse 2 says
[54:01] for everybody that fears the name of the
[54:03] lord once they saw
[54:05] hiroshima and nagasaki
[54:08] everybody was afraid the catholics were
[54:10] afraid the baptists were afraid
[54:12] everybody was afraid
[54:14] because they saw the awesome power that
[54:17] a nuclear annihilation could be now the
[54:19] words of the book was right in front of
[54:21] them and all the papers they could see
[54:23] it
[54:25] but god says
[54:26] but unto you that fear my name
[54:29] before the day of the lord
[54:33] i will rise up
[54:35] with the son of righteousness
[54:37] with healing in his wings and you shall
[54:39] go forth and grow up as calves in the
[54:41] stall
[54:42] i put in healing revival and the healing
[54:45] revival is a term used by many american
[54:48] charismatics to reference to a christian
[54:50] revival movement that began in
[54:54] june
[54:55] of 1946
[55:00] a year after the bomb was dropped
[55:02] and it continued through the 50s
[55:05] in 1956 the healing revival reached its
[55:08] peak with 49 separate evangelists held
[55:11] major meetings around the world
[55:14] and see they couldn't do that in
[55:15] luther's day
[55:17] they couldn't do that in wesley's age
[55:20] because they're all going around by
[55:21] horse and oxcart
[55:23] they were walking johnny appleseed
[55:24] walked all over the united states
[55:26] planting apple trees by foot
[55:29] right that's what he did people just
[55:31] they were not
[55:32] daniel 12 was not fulfilled
[55:36] but we see
[55:38] that all of a sudden when people could
[55:40] go to and fro so we we see that lord yep
[55:44] knowledge shall increase yup we see that
[55:46] all of a sudden we see an example
[55:48] of total annihilation
[55:51] and the next year god
[55:53] rises up out of the ashes of history
[55:56] rises right up out of the ashes of
[55:58] history and there's such a huge healing
[56:01] revival that the whole world takes
[56:03] notice of it amen
[56:05] which is what malachi
[56:08] 4 2 says
[56:10] it continued through the 50s in 1956 the
[56:13] healing revival reached its peak as 49
[56:17] separate evangelists held major meetings
[56:19] by 1960
[56:22] the number of evangelists holding
[56:23] national campaigns
[56:25] dropped to 11.
[56:29] because god had fulfilled his word
[56:33] what is the importance
[56:37] of the healing revival
[56:39] well let's look what the bible says
[56:42] and then those that saw the healing
[56:45] revival and belong to the healing
[56:47] revival salvation went hand in hand with
[56:50] it
[56:51] they saw the healing revival and said
[56:54] the god that's in that bible must be
[56:56] alive because i don't got cancer anymore
[56:58] i'm giving my heart to the lord
[57:00] and when you do that you start to go
[57:03] forth and grow up as a calf in the stall
[57:07] because when you come to god
[57:09] you don't know how to live for god you
[57:12] don't know about the bible you don't
[57:13] know about you don't even know about the
[57:15] creator you don't know anything
[57:18] but when you see the healing if you love
[57:20] god and you see the healing
[57:23] and it catches your attention brother
[57:24] adam said that is what jesus did in the
[57:26] first bowl he said he went around with a
[57:29] healing campaign
[57:30] you see
[57:32] when
[57:33] when jesus did that
[57:35] the scribes and pharisees went back to
[57:37] malachi and they said hey
[57:40] look what's happening
[57:42] amen
[57:42] but they misplaced the scriptures
[57:45] because daniel's prophecy wasn't in the
[57:47] right place
[57:53] and he puts us in here in verse three he
[57:54] says and you shall tread down the wicked
[57:57] for there shall be ashes under the soles
[57:59] of your feet in the day that i should do
[58:01] this
[58:01] you know now see you think oh wait a
[58:03] minute he's talking about malachi 4-1
[58:07] but no the healing revival is before the
[58:10] great and dreadful day of the lord
[58:12] so then what he tells you is that once
[58:14] you start to grow then you find out that
[58:17] everybody no weapon shall prosper
[58:20] against you
[58:21] all your enemies will come and bow at
[58:24] your feet
[58:25] they will become you
[58:27] you get so much power
[58:30] you don't have to worry about these
[58:32] things because all of a sudden you find
[58:34] out that god is in control of everything
[58:38] amen praise the lord amen
[58:41] amen in the day that i shall do this i
[58:44] shall do this that's what i like about
[58:46] god
[58:47] when i came and said lord save me he did
[58:51] and then when he did that then he did
[58:54] all the other things too
[58:56] it wasn't me trying to figure out well
[58:57] how do i do this he said you know
[58:59] brother branham told a story about the
[59:01] eagle he says that little eagle is in
[59:02] the chicken yard he was an eagle to
[59:04] begin with
[59:05] but he all the chickens had convinced
[59:07] him he was a chicken
[59:10] i wonder how many of us are still
[59:11] chickens
[59:13] and then one day he heard the mama
[59:15] scream
[59:16] he saw the healing revival
[59:18] and he's and he heard that scream
[59:20] because the scream was inside of his
[59:22] heart already
[59:24] so the scream in his heart
[59:26] answered the scream that was up there
[59:28] and when that happened he said mama how
[59:30] do i get up there she said just jump
[59:33] donna and i we were watching we had some
[59:35] house friends in this little uh
[59:37] birdhouse and we could hear them and
[59:38] then after a while they were building
[59:40] the nesting and the husband was always
[59:42] singing for the bride and the bride
[59:43] would come by and then then she'd fly
[59:45] away you know because that's how they
[59:46] are they're kind of hard to catch the
[59:47] brides
[59:49] and he'd sing even harder he said i got
[59:51] a house for you i got everything ready
[59:53] for you please come be my bride and she
[59:56] finally came
[59:57] and after a couple weeks then we could
[59:59] hear the little the little chicks they
[1:00:01] started to peep
[1:00:02] they started to peep and i said well
[1:00:04] done i said now i got to keep our eye
[1:00:05] real close on this because i said i want
[1:00:06] to watch this
[1:00:08] and after a while
[1:00:09] after about five six days all of a
[1:00:11] sudden
[1:00:12] this one little he got up and jumped on
[1:00:14] our front banister
[1:00:16] and i sat down i said i think it's one
[1:00:17] of the babies when he started to fly
[1:00:20] he just he's flapping his wing think
[1:00:23] think
[1:00:24] he doesn't know what flapping your wings
[1:00:26] means
[1:00:28] a baby when he gets up
[1:00:30] he he just there's something inside of
[1:00:33] him i don't want to crawl anymore he'll
[1:00:35] get up and he'll stand and do something
[1:00:38] because he says there's more to life
[1:00:40] than just crawling down here in the dirt
[1:00:42] amen
[1:00:43] amen and that little birdie come on he
[1:00:46] flaps his wings he went right down to
[1:00:47] the grass and i said
[1:00:49] okay boy
[1:00:50] jump
[1:00:52] because mom was sitting up in the one
[1:00:54] branch singing to him and papa was over
[1:00:56] here he was singing to him and then the
[1:00:58] other one came out and it fell down into
[1:00:59] the flowers and then we i said okay we
[1:01:02] got to stay away because we want to
[1:01:03] scare the parents away and we come back
[1:01:05] couple hours they were long gone
[1:01:09] long gone
[1:01:12] praise the lord
[1:01:15] when he saved me
[1:01:17] he started me on this and he said
[1:01:20] i'm going to take you everything that he
[1:01:23] started he's going to finish
[1:01:24] amen he's going to finish it
[1:01:27] so he says in verse 4 now there's
[1:01:29] there's a caution to this
[1:01:32] he says when you see the son of
[1:01:35] righteousness rising with healing in his
[1:01:37] wings he says
[1:01:39] then you've got to learn to walk with me
[1:01:42] you've got to learn
[1:01:44] to eat
[1:01:45] what i feed you you've got to learn
[1:01:47] these things
[1:01:48] and then he says
[1:01:50] remember ye the law of moses my servant
[1:01:54] why would he say that
[1:01:57] because up till that time
[1:01:59] moses was the greatest prophet
[1:02:03] that israel ever had
[1:02:05] not only was the greatest prophet but he
[1:02:07] was the lawgiver
[1:02:09] god god when you know miriam and aaron
[1:02:12] they they chided with moses about
[1:02:14] something and god got so mad he come
[1:02:17] down he says make them come over here by
[1:02:18] the
[1:02:19] because they're not listening very well
[1:02:23] and when they came down god came down in
[1:02:24] the pillar of fire and he said don't you
[1:02:26] even fear me
[1:02:28] what is wrong with you
[1:02:32] he says if there be a prophet amongst
[1:02:33] you if there be someone else he says
[1:02:34] i'll talk to them in dreams or i'll give
[1:02:37] them visions but he said not so with
[1:02:40] moses he said how to come down i talked
[1:02:42] from my lips right to his ears
[1:02:46] amen
[1:02:48] and it was moses god cursed miriam
[1:02:52] with uh leprosy
[1:02:57] god would have never healed her without
[1:02:59] moses's prayer
[1:03:02] moses stood in the gap for his foolish
[1:03:05] sister
[1:03:06] and god healed her
[1:03:08] so malachi when he said this remember
[1:03:10] the law of moses my servant
[1:03:13] which i commanded unto him in horeb for
[1:03:16] all israel not just whoever pick and
[1:03:18] choose or whatever he says all of israel
[1:03:20] with the statutes
[1:03:22] and the judgments
[1:03:25] amen
[1:03:26] amen
[1:03:30] i want you to notice
[1:03:31] let's go over here to luke 24.
[1:03:35] this is the last
[1:03:38] chapter of the book of luke
[1:03:41] and now it's important now you could
[1:03:43] start to see
[1:03:45] so it's been 400 years since malachi has
[1:03:47] died
[1:03:48] his prophecies are read in the church
[1:03:50] services
[1:03:51] jesus has come on the scene
[1:03:54] they know that the son of righteousness
[1:03:56] is here he died which was a surprise to
[1:03:59] them
[1:04:00] he rose from the dead they're still
[1:04:02] expecting
[1:04:04] the burning of the world
[1:04:07] because that is exactly how the
[1:04:10] scriptures are written
[1:04:13] they're expecting
[1:04:15] god to destroy the world
[1:04:20] verse 41 he says and while they yet
[1:04:22] believed not for joy
[1:04:25] isn't that amazing
[1:04:26] they didn't they weren't even happy that
[1:04:28] he erased them that they were just happy
[1:04:31] because it says they wondered
[1:04:34] they were this man who had died and been
[1:04:37] dead for three days and rose from the
[1:04:39] dead and now he appears to them and they
[1:04:41] you know you would think you would be
[1:04:43] happy for joy but they were not happy
[1:04:45] for joy
[1:04:46] luke said they weren't happy for joy
[1:04:47] they were just happy
[1:04:49] because they said you know what jesus is
[1:04:51] the answer
[1:04:52] now i can go back to just doing whatever
[1:04:54] what i was doing before fighting about
[1:04:55] who's going to be the biggest one in the
[1:04:57] church
[1:04:58] now i can go back to just being because
[1:04:59] jesus here we've got any questions we
[1:05:01] get in the boat and the storm comes up
[1:05:03] we'll just call jesus
[1:05:06] so we're happy but it's not very joyful
[1:05:12] and while they believed not for joy and
[1:05:14] wondered he said unto them
[1:05:16] have you hear any meat
[1:05:19] and they gave him a place of broiled
[1:05:20] fish and of a honeycomb and he took it
[1:05:24] and he did eat it before them
[1:05:26] and he said unto them
[1:05:28] these are the words which i spake unto
[1:05:30] you while i was yet with you
[1:05:33] that all things must be fulfilled which
[1:05:36] were written in the
[1:05:38] what what
[1:05:40] the law
[1:05:41] of moses
[1:05:47] and in the prophets and in the psalms
[1:05:49] concerning me
[1:05:51] then open he their understanding that
[1:05:54] they might understand the scriptures
[1:05:58] oh my
[1:05:59] oh my look at matthew 5 this is very
[1:06:02] familiar
[1:06:04] but you'll see
[1:06:06] they they their expectation was
[1:06:08] different because there was no prophet
[1:06:11] after malachi
[1:06:13] and that's all they had was malachi 4 to
[1:06:15] look at
[1:06:16] and when you go over to matthew 5 17 it
[1:06:19] says think not that i have come to
[1:06:21] destroy the law or the prophets i didn't
[1:06:23] come to start a new church or anything
[1:06:25] that i did not come to destroy but to
[1:06:27] fulfill for verily i sent you till
[1:06:30] heaven and earth pass one jut or one
[1:06:32] tittle shall in no wise pass from the
[1:06:35] law till all be fulfilled
[1:06:38] and that's malachi 4
[1:06:41] 4.
[1:06:45] remember the law of moses with all the
[1:06:47] judgments and all the statutes and
[1:06:50] everything because heaven and earth the
[1:06:52] day of the lord verse 1
[1:06:55] can't happen
[1:06:56] until every scripture every jot every
[1:07:00] tittle everything the prophet said
[1:07:03] everything's in the psalms everything
[1:07:05] that's in the proverbs everything that's
[1:07:06] in ecclesiastes it's all got to be
[1:07:09] fulfilled and then the end shall come
[1:07:12] amen amen
[1:07:16] because look now let's go to hebrews 10
[1:07:20] and talk about the law of moses
[1:07:26] amen
[1:07:27] hebrews 10
[1:07:29] verse 26 so here are these people
[1:07:32] let's presume
[1:07:34] they see the healing revival in 1946
[1:07:38] and they come into the message well not
[1:07:40] the message but they come into the
[1:07:41] churches by like just thousands brother
[1:07:45] branham talk he thought he had a million
[1:07:47] come in come into the kingdom of god and
[1:07:50] they all came in
[1:07:52] but what if they forgot the law of moses
[1:07:58] they came in but they forgot about the
[1:08:01] law of the prophets
[1:08:03] they forgotted the statutes they forgot
[1:08:05] the judgments they forgot the history of
[1:08:07] david and daniel and the lions then and
[1:08:09] they forgot all those things in the old
[1:08:11] testament because now we're in the new
[1:08:12] testament
[1:08:16] verse 26 says for if we sin willfully
[1:08:19] after that we have received the
[1:08:20] knowledge of the truth there remaineth
[1:08:22] no more sacrifice for sin
[1:08:25] and how shall we know that you're
[1:08:27] sinning if you don't know the law
[1:08:30] because if there is no law there is no
[1:08:32] sin
[1:08:33] but by the law sin came in
[1:08:36] how was i to know that i was a sinner
[1:08:38] until i read the law of god and found
[1:08:40] out i was a sinner
[1:08:44] and now look at what he says he says
[1:08:46] there remaineth then no more sacrifice
[1:08:49] for sin
[1:08:50] but but i saw the healing revival i saw
[1:08:53] it
[1:08:54] yes
[1:08:55] but if you don't stick with moses and
[1:08:58] the prophets if you don't hear his voice
[1:09:04] there is no more sacrifice but a certain
[1:09:06] fearful looking for of judgment
[1:09:09] and
[1:09:11] fiery
[1:09:12] [Music]
[1:09:14] malachi 4-1
[1:09:18] indignation that's how god's going to
[1:09:21] destroy the world he's finally going to
[1:09:22] get fed up i'm when you're indignant
[1:09:24] you're just i've had enough
[1:09:27] fiery indignation which shall devour
[1:09:31] all they that are proud and do wickedly
[1:09:34] and they shall be stubble
[1:09:38] he that despised moses's law died
[1:09:41] without mercy under two or three
[1:09:43] witnesses
[1:09:44] how much more sore or punishment suppose
[1:09:47] ye shall he be thought worthy who hath
[1:09:50] trodden underfoot the son of god and
[1:09:52] have counted the blood of the covenant
[1:09:54] where when he was sanctified an unholy
[1:09:57] thing and have done despite under the
[1:09:59] spirit of grace
[1:10:01] wow
[1:10:02] so now we've gone from the law of moses
[1:10:05] to the king of kings the lord of lords
[1:10:07] the only sacrifice that you can ever
[1:10:09] accept that'll get you into heaven and
[1:10:12] if you spit on that thing if you do
[1:10:14] anything against that
[1:10:16] how much more sore punishment look at
[1:10:19] what he says
[1:10:21] for we know that him that hath said
[1:10:23] vengeance belongeth unto me i will
[1:10:26] recompense saith the lord
[1:10:30] malachi 4 is plain
[1:10:32] that this is the day of the lord and
[1:10:35] that is god i will do these things
[1:10:39] in verse 3 that's what he said he said
[1:10:41] he said
[1:10:43] you will walk on the ashes of these
[1:10:45] people in the day that i do these things
[1:10:51] vengeance belongeth unto me i will
[1:10:52] recompense and again the lord shall
[1:10:55] judge his people it is a fearful thing
[1:10:59] to fall into the hands of the living god
[1:11:02] amen
[1:11:04] amen in the unpardonable sin 1954
[1:11:07] brother branham said so how much more
[1:11:08] punishment will it be when under the
[1:11:10] dying lamb that a man that despised or
[1:11:13] done rejected to the law of moses
[1:11:19] when he rejected to the law of moses he
[1:11:21] had to die without mercy because the
[1:11:23] lamb had died instead how much more is
[1:11:26] that man rejected who despises the blood
[1:11:29] of jesus christ and saw the healing
[1:11:32] campaigns
[1:11:37] amen
[1:11:38] so let's go back to malachi 4.
[1:11:42] praise god
[1:11:46] so we see
[1:11:48] malachi 4 1
[1:11:50] is a it's going to happen
[1:11:53] and then in verse 2 he says
[1:11:55] but unto you that fear my name shall the
[1:11:57] son of righteousness so if you fear god
[1:12:01] then god will make a way for you amen
[1:12:05] but when he gets down to verse 5 now
[1:12:07] this is the third part
[1:12:08] he says behold i will send you elijah
[1:12:11] the prophet before the coming of the
[1:12:13] great and dreadful day of the lord well
[1:12:15] why isn't that verse one
[1:12:19] it should be verse
[1:12:20] one he should you know
[1:12:23] verse two should be i don't know verse
[1:12:26] six
[1:12:27] and then if the chapter should end up
[1:12:30] with
[1:12:31] when the day of the lord comes
[1:12:32] everything's gonna be done way we're
[1:12:33] gonna burn this place down
[1:12:35] but god
[1:12:37] he hides it from the wise and the
[1:12:38] prudent he puts it in there so his
[1:12:41] children can hear the voice of god when
[1:12:43] god speaks
[1:12:45] so before the dreadful day of the lord
[1:12:49] god said i will send you elijah the
[1:12:50] prophet
[1:12:52] and he shall turn the heart of the
[1:12:53] fathers to the children and the heart of
[1:12:54] the children to the fathers
[1:12:57] lest i come and smite the earth with a
[1:12:59] curse and god says
[1:13:03] there will be this
[1:13:04] this healing campaign thing happening
[1:13:08] and then also behold i will send you
[1:13:10] elijah the prophet
[1:13:12] amen
[1:13:15] i want to go here to matthew 17.
[1:13:20] praise the lord
[1:13:32] matthew 17
[1:13:34] verse 5.
[1:13:36] so he says so while he had spake now
[1:13:39] remember
[1:13:40] the disciples
[1:13:42] james john
[1:13:44] and peter
[1:13:45] who had all gone up into the mount of
[1:13:46] transfiguration they had all been raised
[1:13:49] by their parents to believe the prophets
[1:13:53] and one of the prophets that they
[1:13:55] believed was malachi
[1:13:57] and they all knew malachi 4.
[1:14:01] they all knew malachi
[1:14:04] the scribes of pharisees quoted malachi
[1:14:07] they so so now here jesus comes
[1:14:11] and and they follow him because who else
[1:14:13] has the words to eternal life
[1:14:17] jesus goes and takes peter james and
[1:14:19] john and he takes them up to the mount
[1:14:20] transfiguration he gets them up there
[1:14:23] and verse 5 says
[1:14:25] it's important that you know that that
[1:14:27] setting
[1:14:29] it's important that you see that
[1:14:32] while he had spake behold a bright cloud
[1:14:34] overshadowed them and behold a voice
[1:14:37] came out of the cloud which said this is
[1:14:39] my beloved son in whom i am well pleased
[1:14:42] hear ye him
[1:14:44] and when the disciples heard it they
[1:14:46] fell on their face and they were sore
[1:14:48] afraid because they were afraid of god
[1:14:50] they were afraid to look on god but god
[1:14:53] clearly identified who jesus was
[1:14:58] clearly identified
[1:15:00] and they fell on their face
[1:15:02] and jesus came and touched them
[1:15:04] and he said arise and be not afraid
[1:15:08] and when they had lifted up their eyes
[1:15:10] they saw no man save jesus only and as
[1:15:13] they came down from the mountain jesus
[1:15:15] charged them saying tell the vision to
[1:15:18] no man until the son of man be risen
[1:15:20] again from the dead but they didn't
[1:15:22] believe that
[1:15:23] because they didn't believe he was going
[1:15:24] to die
[1:15:27] they just didn't believe that
[1:15:30] it's hard to comprehend the spiritual
[1:15:32] things of god
[1:15:33] it's just hard
[1:15:35] so he told them that he says so don't
[1:15:37] tell the vision to anybody until the son
[1:15:39] of man be again risen from the dead
[1:15:43] and the disciples starting to look back
[1:15:46] at malachi
[1:15:47] said wait a minute
[1:15:51] the scripture says
[1:15:54] because what were they looking for
[1:15:57] they were looking for malachi 4 1.
[1:16:01] they were looking for malachi 4 1
[1:16:04] and malachi 4 5
[1:16:06] said before i destroy the world i will
[1:16:09] send you elijah
[1:16:13] and they said
[1:16:14] well if you're christ
[1:16:17] then where's the elijah
[1:16:20] it's a reasonable question
[1:16:23] where is he
[1:16:26] where's the elijah
[1:16:29] where's he at
[1:16:33] praise the lord
[1:16:37] so verse 11 says and jesus answered and
[1:16:40] said unto them elias truly shall first
[1:16:42] come and restore all things but i say
[1:16:45] unto you that elias has come already and
[1:16:48] they knew him not
[1:16:50] but have done unto him whatsoever they
[1:16:52] listed likewise shall also the son of
[1:16:54] man suffer of them
[1:16:56] then the disciples understood that he
[1:16:58] spake unto them of john the baptist
[1:17:02] and they put john the baptist in malachi
[1:17:05] 4 5.
[1:17:09] they put him there
[1:17:12] but that isn't where he was
[1:17:14] that wasn't where he was at all
[1:17:17] and they also had forgotten the
[1:17:18] scriptures because because jesus told
[1:17:21] them he said they have done unto him
[1:17:23] whatsoever they listed or whatever was
[1:17:26] prophesied by the prophets and moses in
[1:17:29] the old testament
[1:17:31] it wasn't you got just a choice you're
[1:17:33] going to just do something it's got to
[1:17:35] be according to the scriptures
[1:17:37] because he said and the reason why i say
[1:17:39] that it says likewise shall also the son
[1:17:42] of man suffer the same death
[1:17:46] the same problem
[1:17:48] amen
[1:17:50] so they asked this question they said
[1:17:51] well if you're the son of god where is
[1:17:53] elijah
[1:17:54] so let's go to matthew 3
[1:17:57] verse 1.
[1:17:59] so we want to go and look
[1:18:00] now remember
[1:18:02] the world did not burn up like they
[1:18:04] thought it should
[1:18:05] it didn't happen like you know they they
[1:18:08] when malachi prophesied they thought
[1:18:11] within a few years the world will burn
[1:18:12] up but it didn't
[1:18:14] and then time went on and and it just
[1:18:16] didn't happen and then finally one day
[1:18:18] jesus appeared
[1:18:20] and and they were kind of surprised
[1:18:24] well matthew 3 1 says
[1:18:26] so we're going to read all
[1:18:28] so in those days came john the baptist
[1:18:31] preaching in the wilderness of judea now
[1:18:33] the last thing that jesus said in
[1:18:34] matthew 17 was the disciples then
[1:18:37] understood
[1:18:39] that he spoke about
[1:18:41] john the baptist
[1:18:45] but they thought he was elijah of
[1:18:47] malachi 4 5.
[1:18:52] and john the baptist came preaching in
[1:18:55] the wilderness of judea saying repent ye
[1:18:57] for the kingdom of heaven is at hand
[1:18:59] and this is he that was spoken by the
[1:19:02] prophet isaiah
[1:19:04] saying the voice of one crying in the
[1:19:05] wilderness prepare ye the way of the
[1:19:08] lord make his path straight
[1:19:11] there is no mention of elijah in that
[1:19:13] prophecy in isaiah
[1:19:20] amen let's go to luke 3.
[1:19:30] we'll come back to mark but we go to
[1:19:32] luke
[1:19:33] 3.
[1:19:42] in luke 3
[1:19:44] starting verse 3 and it says it came
[1:19:47] into all the country about jordan and he
[1:19:50] came into all the country about jordan
[1:19:52] preaching the baptism of repentance for
[1:19:55] the remission of sins as it was written
[1:19:57] in the book of the words of isaiah the
[1:19:59] prophet saying the voice of one crying
[1:20:01] in the wilderness prepare ye the way of
[1:20:03] the lord make his path straight every
[1:20:06] valley shall be filled every mountain
[1:20:08] hill shall be brought low and the
[1:20:09] crooked shall be made straight and the
[1:20:11] rough way shall be made smooth and all
[1:20:14] flesh shall see the salvation of god
[1:20:17] because there is no other salvation
[1:20:20] outside of jesus christ
[1:20:23] amen so we have two witnesses
[1:20:26] matthew identifies
[1:20:28] john the baptist as
[1:20:30] isaiah i think it's isaiah 40
[1:20:33] verse 3 to 5.
[1:20:35] he identifies him there
[1:20:37] luke identifies him there now let's see
[1:20:40] what mark says about him
[1:20:47] so mark
[1:20:48] chapter 1 verse 1 in the beginning of
[1:20:52] the gospel of jesus christ the son of
[1:20:53] god as it is written in the prophets
[1:20:57] behold i send my messenger before thy
[1:20:59] face which should prepare thy way before
[1:21:02] thee
[1:21:03] the voice of one crying in the
[1:21:04] wilderness prepare ye the way of the
[1:21:06] lord make his path straight john did
[1:21:09] baptize in the wilderness and preach the
[1:21:11] baptism of repentance for the remission
[1:21:12] of sins
[1:21:16] but
[1:21:17] verse 2
[1:21:19] when he says behold i will send my
[1:21:21] messenger before thy face that's not
[1:21:24] isaiah 40.
[1:21:25] that's malachi chapter 3
[1:21:29] amen
[1:21:31] malachi 3 1. let's go there and read it
[1:21:34] because
[1:21:35] because when you see that had been 400
[1:21:38] years they had no prophet all they had
[1:21:40] was the pharisees and the sadducees
[1:21:42] interpreting the scriptures and reading
[1:21:44] the scriptures to them they thought they
[1:21:46] had the right interpretation
[1:21:49] but malachi 3 says behold i will send my
[1:21:52] messenger that's exactly what it says
[1:21:55] behold i will send my messenger before
[1:21:57] my face and he shall prepare the way
[1:22:00] before me and the lord whom you seek
[1:22:02] shall suddenly come to the temple
[1:22:05] even the messenger of the covenant whom
[1:22:07] ye delight in behold he shall come saith
[1:22:10] the lord of hosts
[1:22:12] amen
[1:22:14] amen
[1:22:16] so we've got this little bit of a
[1:22:18] problem here now
[1:22:21] where is elijah of malachi 4 and 5
[1:22:25] or
[1:22:26] chapter 4 5 and 6
[1:22:29] where is that elijah
[1:22:32] because
[1:22:33] john the baptist
[1:22:35] is not malachi 4
[1:22:37] 5 and 6.
[1:22:42] so let's go here to luke 1.
[1:22:46] uh nope nope we're going to john 1.
[1:22:49] so let's listen to
[1:22:51] john's
[1:22:52] or uh
[1:22:55] yeah john the baptist let's listen to
[1:22:57] his own testimony
[1:22:59] john 1
[1:23:02] verse 19.
[1:23:05] it says and this is the record of john
[1:23:07] when the jews sent priests and levites
[1:23:10] from jerusalem to ask him
[1:23:12] who art thou
[1:23:14] now you know why they asked him that
[1:23:16] question because it didn't quite fit in
[1:23:19] the scripture interpretation that they
[1:23:21] had
[1:23:24] they were they were saying wait a minute
[1:23:25] if if this is this and this is this and
[1:23:28] i'm looking here and i'm looking here
[1:23:30] because that was why the scribes and the
[1:23:32] pharisees always argued with jesus
[1:23:34] because they said wait a minute we look
[1:23:36] in the bible and you're not him
[1:23:38] because we're not born of fornication
[1:23:40] you are
[1:23:41] that's against moses's law your
[1:23:43] disciples picked corn on the sabbath day
[1:23:46] and ate it you healed a man on the
[1:23:48] sabbath day that's against the law it's
[1:23:49] against see they couldn't place him in
[1:23:51] the scriptures and so when when john
[1:23:54] showed up
[1:23:55] john showed up and it's an amazing thing
[1:23:58] he just comes down and he starts
[1:23:59] preaching and all of judea everybody
[1:24:02] they go wait wait wait wait wait wait
[1:24:04] there's a prophet there's something
[1:24:06] going on down at the river jordan and
[1:24:08] they all run out to see him and they
[1:24:10] want to place him where does he fit in
[1:24:13] the scriptures
[1:24:16] he says who art thou
[1:24:20] and he confessed and denied not but
[1:24:22] confessed i am not the christ
[1:24:25] because that's who they thought he was
[1:24:28] that first thing they said are you the
[1:24:30] christ and he says nope
[1:24:32] not the christ
[1:24:36] and then they ask him what then art thou
[1:24:40] elias
[1:24:43] are you elijah
[1:24:45] and he said
[1:24:47] nope i am not
[1:24:49] art thou that prophet
[1:24:51] that comes before the great and dreadful
[1:24:53] day of the lord
[1:24:54] and he said no i'm not that one either.
[1:24:58] see they totally misplaced him in the
[1:25:01] scriptures
[1:25:03] and if you misplace john
[1:25:06] you misplace jesus
[1:25:09] and if you misplace jesus there's no
[1:25:12] salvation
[1:25:16] you have to know where you stand amen
[1:25:22] then they said unto him
[1:25:24] well who are you then we don't know what
[1:25:26] to do because we got to go tell these
[1:25:28] guys that sent us please what should
[1:25:31] what do you say about yourself
[1:25:34] and john said
[1:25:35] i am the voice of one crying in the
[1:25:38] wilderness make straight the way of the
[1:25:40] lord as said the prophet isaiah
[1:25:44] amen
[1:25:47] john knew who he was
[1:25:50] amen
[1:25:52] so elijah this is kind of a this is kind
[1:25:56] of jesus said he was
[1:25:58] and jesus said he's going to come first
[1:26:01] and restore all things
[1:26:03] but he's already calm and that confused
[1:26:06] him because they couldn't figure out
[1:26:08] what is he here is it gone is it calm is
[1:26:10] what what's happening here
[1:26:12] so we found out that john knew exactly
[1:26:16] who he was
[1:26:18] so i want to go to luke 1.
[1:26:23] when i when i
[1:26:25] read this scripture i knew about this
[1:26:27] but
[1:26:28] this just really blessed me
[1:26:32] luke 1
[1:26:33] now here's zachariah
[1:26:36] zachariah and his wife elizabeth they
[1:26:38] were well old and stricken in age kind
[1:26:40] of like sister don and me
[1:26:43] or maybe brother johnson's sister
[1:26:44] johnson
[1:26:45] and they never had any kids
[1:26:48] they hadn't been but he was a faithful
[1:26:50] priest he believed the word of god he
[1:26:53] believed the law and the prophets he did
[1:26:55] his duty he came in he lit the candle
[1:26:57] and the in the shoe bread and he made
[1:27:00] sure that the lamp didn't go out inside
[1:27:02] and on the day of the sabbath day he
[1:27:04] goes in
[1:27:06] and he goes in to do the priesthood
[1:27:08] things so he goes into the outer
[1:27:10] it's it's
[1:27:12] inside the outer veil he goes in because
[1:27:15] he's not going into the holiest of
[1:27:16] holies but he's going in where the shoe
[1:27:18] bread is and where the seven golden
[1:27:20] candlestick is and the altar is and and
[1:27:22] those things and he goes in there to to
[1:27:25] do the ablation
[1:27:28] and it says according to the custom of
[1:27:30] the police office
[1:27:32] oh i got verse 11. okay so we'll skip
[1:27:34] some of that verse 11 it says and there
[1:27:36] appeared unto him an angel of the lord
[1:27:39] standing on the right side of the altar
[1:27:40] of incense
[1:27:42] so he's inside there
[1:27:44] zacharias saw him
[1:27:46] and he was troubled
[1:27:48] nobody's supposed to be in here
[1:27:51] this is a sacred place what are you
[1:27:53] doing in here brother mark
[1:27:56] and fear fell upon him
[1:27:59] but the angel said unto him
[1:28:01] fear not zechariah for thy prayer is
[1:28:04] heard and thy wife elizabeth shall bear
[1:28:05] thee a son and thou shalt call his name
[1:28:07] john
[1:28:08] and thou shalt have joy and gladness and
[1:28:10] many shall rejoice at his birth for he
[1:28:13] should be given he should be great in
[1:28:15] the sight of the lord and shall drink
[1:28:16] neither wine or strong drink and he
[1:28:19] should be filled with the holy ghost
[1:28:20] even from his mother's womb wish i could
[1:28:22] have had that prophecy
[1:28:25] yeah
[1:28:26] even from his mother's womb he's going
[1:28:28] to be filled with the holy ghost and
[1:28:29] many of the children of israel shall he
[1:28:31] turn to the lord their god
[1:28:34] and he shall go before him in the spirit
[1:28:37] and power of elijah
[1:28:42] the angel
[1:28:43] identified john
[1:28:46] as elijah
[1:28:48] what a and look look go back here to
[1:28:51] malachi 4.
[1:28:53] oh it's beautiful it's a beautiful thing
[1:28:57] so verse 5 says behold i will send you
[1:29:00] elijah the prophet before the coming of
[1:29:02] the great and dreadful day of the lord
[1:29:03] so they knew
[1:29:05] if elijah shows up
[1:29:08] the dr great and dreadful day of the
[1:29:09] lord is next
[1:29:11] if he shows up
[1:29:13] and then and when john showed up they
[1:29:15] said oh
[1:29:16] this is
[1:29:18] is is he
[1:29:19] so
[1:29:20] so the romans we're not going to be
[1:29:22] under the romans anymore praise the lord
[1:29:25] praise god
[1:29:27] yes it's great to be great
[1:29:29] because we've got prophecy for it
[1:29:31] look at what verse 6 says and he shall
[1:29:34] turn the heart of the fathers to the
[1:29:37] children
[1:29:39] the angel in luke 1 17
[1:29:43] says
[1:29:44] he
[1:29:45] be will go before him in the spirit and
[1:29:48] power of elijah to turn the heart of the
[1:29:51] fathers to the children and the
[1:29:54] disobedient to the wisdom of the just
[1:29:56] but he misquoted the scripture
[1:29:59] because malachi 4 6 says he shall turn
[1:30:02] the heart of the fathers to the children
[1:30:04] and the heart of the children to the
[1:30:06] fathers
[1:30:09] but the angel didn't misquote the
[1:30:11] scripture
[1:30:13] because that elijah
[1:30:15] did
[1:30:16] just that
[1:30:18] the first half
[1:30:21] to make ready a people prepared for the
[1:30:24] lord
[1:30:25] amen
[1:30:27] amen
[1:30:29] amen
[1:30:31] amen
[1:30:33] so god has fulfilled or fulfilled the
[1:30:36] first half
[1:30:38] of malachi 4 6
[1:30:40] in john the baptist
[1:30:43] but he didn't fulfill the second half of
[1:30:46] 4-6
[1:30:49] he didn't
[1:30:53] and jesus at the end of luke said
[1:30:58] remember
[1:30:59] remember brothers remember sisters
[1:31:02] not one jot not one tittle not one
[1:31:05] prophecy
[1:31:07] nothing can fall to the to the ground
[1:31:10] every word has to be fulfilled before i
[1:31:14] come back
[1:31:17] now
[1:31:19] i want you to go to acts 3.
[1:31:27] when we go to acts 3 we find out that
[1:31:31] this is a sermon
[1:31:34] that peter made and peter had already
[1:31:37] given that prophecy
[1:31:39] in this in second peter he peter knew
[1:31:42] that when the day of the lord came the
[1:31:43] world was going to be destroyed by fire
[1:31:45] and and we read that
[1:31:47] but peter here
[1:31:50] um
[1:31:52] we're going to start at verse 18.
[1:31:55] he says but those things which god
[1:31:58] before had showed by the mouth of all of
[1:32:00] his prophets
[1:32:02] that christ should suffer
[1:32:04] he hath so fulfilled
[1:32:08] remember ye the law
[1:32:11] of moses
[1:32:13] and peter is quoting that to the jews
[1:32:17] he says so repent ye therefore and be
[1:32:20] converted that your sins may be blotted
[1:32:22] out when the times of refreshing shall
[1:32:25] come from the presence of the lord
[1:32:27] because the time of refreshing hadn't
[1:32:29] come
[1:32:30] if they weren't born again
[1:32:35] and he shall send jesus christ
[1:32:38] which before was preached unto you
[1:32:41] went whom the heaven must receive until
[1:32:45] the times of restitution
[1:32:48] of all things
[1:32:50] which god had spoken by the mouth of all
[1:32:53] of his holy prophets
[1:32:55] since the world began
[1:33:00] so when peter quotes this
[1:33:03] he's telling them
[1:33:05] everything that malachi 4 talks about
[1:33:10] he said if you see the healing revival
[1:33:13] rejoice
[1:33:16] rejoice
[1:33:17] when you see it
[1:33:19] but remember the law of moses and the
[1:33:22] prophets
[1:33:23] i wonder why
[1:33:24] because it had been lost
[1:33:26] it had been destroyed
[1:33:28] it had been mixed up in all these ages
[1:33:32] but when god brought elijah on the scene
[1:33:36] when
[1:33:37] after 1945
[1:33:40] that's why he only let them go as far
[1:33:43] you know i mean it wasn't long and
[1:33:44] russia had the nuclear weapons
[1:33:47] and what was stopping them from dropping
[1:33:49] them somewhere
[1:33:50] what was stopping anybody from what's
[1:33:52] stopping a terrorist from dropping a
[1:33:54] nuclear weapon
[1:33:56] all the word of god has to be fulfilled
[1:34:00] and the second half of malachi 4
[1:34:03] must
[1:34:04] be fulfilled
[1:34:06] because it says if i don't do it look at
[1:34:08] malachi 4 6
[1:34:11] he says if i don't send you elijah
[1:34:16] and let him restore everything
[1:34:20] if i don't do that
[1:34:22] i will come and smite the earth with a
[1:34:25] curse
[1:34:26] and no one will be saved
[1:34:30] no one will be saved why would god do
[1:34:33] this with elijah because elijah is the
[1:34:36] only prophet that you can find in the
[1:34:38] old testament
[1:34:40] that called fire down from heaven
[1:34:43] that was that was one of his gifts
[1:34:46] and one of the things he did when the
[1:34:48] children of israel had lost their way
[1:34:50] and forgotten the law of moses and
[1:34:52] everything else and they were following
[1:34:54] after baal and everything else and and
[1:34:56] they were blind and naked and cold and
[1:34:59] and they didn't know it they didn't know
[1:35:00] if they were just they were exactly
[1:35:02] hostile they didn't even know it
[1:35:04] god had an elijah come
[1:35:07] and repair the altar
[1:35:09] he repaired the altar and he showed him
[1:35:12] he showed him he went and got the
[1:35:13] sacrifice he put the sacrifice on there
[1:35:15] he poured the water on there he poured
[1:35:17] all kinds of water on there when water
[1:35:20] was a very very precious thing because
[1:35:22] it didn't rain in three years
[1:35:24] it's pretty precious i want to know
[1:35:26] where they got all that water from
[1:35:27] i think that king ahab was hoarding it
[1:35:31] yeah you know how the rich hoard stuff
[1:35:34] and then so he came and they poured it
[1:35:36] all on there
[1:35:38] and elijah said he said now let them
[1:35:41] know
[1:35:42] that i have done all these things
[1:35:46] at thy command
[1:35:48] and he said then
[1:35:50] the fire
[1:35:52] came down
[1:35:53] that's malachi
[1:35:55] 4 5 and 6.
[1:35:58] the fire can't fall
[1:36:01] till everything is restored
[1:36:04] everything is back in its perfect place
[1:36:07] everything is in order
[1:36:09] every one of you is in the right place
[1:36:12] amen
[1:36:15] the whole elect god knows where his seat
[1:36:17] is
[1:36:18] mama eagle knew where every eaglet was
[1:36:22] he knew where you were sister linda he
[1:36:24] knew
[1:36:26] he knew where we all were
[1:36:27] he knew where we were at
[1:36:29] right by the ferguson he knew where we
[1:36:31] were at
[1:36:33] but when it's all completely restored
[1:36:37] and elijah can say i've done everything
[1:36:39] you told me to do believe me
[1:36:41] the fire is going to fall
[1:36:44] amen
[1:36:45] amen
[1:36:47] amen

[1:37:26] misplace john
[1:37:27] you can't find christ
[1:37:29] and if we misplace the elijah in this
[1:37:31] age
[1:37:32] where's no salvation
[1:37:35] there's no salvation this world is
[1:37:37] quickly
[1:37:38] it's going like a madman right to hell
[1:37:42] it's it's just falling apart around us
[1:37:45] but lord you already gave us a promise
[1:37:47] you already gave us a promise you would
[1:37:49] watch over us you would keep us
