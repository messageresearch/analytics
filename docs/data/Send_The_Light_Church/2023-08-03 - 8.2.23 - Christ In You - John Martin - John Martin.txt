TRANSCRIPT
========================================
only believe only believe all things are possible only believe Lord I believe hello Lord I believe all things are possible Lord I believe Lord I believe Lord I believe [Music] all things are possible Lord I believe cause Jesus is here Jesus Jesus is here Lord we stand here in need of you what a privilege it is to be in your presence but Lord we're unworthy unworthy of your presence unworthy that you would come amongst us and unveil yourself and reveal to us more of your life to us but God we humbly bow before you Thank You for Your Grace today thank you thank you for your presence thank you for being faithful to your word thank you Lord for each and every one of your children today that have that same love in their heart for you I want to please you and want to be ready in that hour that you would call us home Lord we're looking to you and as your blessings upon the reading of your word today bless the ears that were here bless these lips that would speak Lord may you be in it all we thank you for these things in Jesus Christ's name amen amen Colossians chapter 1 starting with verse number 23. if ye continue in the faith grounded and settled and be not moved away from the hope of the Gospel which ye have heard in which was preached to every creature that is under Heaven wherever I Paul made a minister who now rejoice in my sufferings for you and fill up that which is behind the afflictions of Christ in my flesh for his body's sake which is the church where have I made a minister according to the dispensation of God which is given to me for you to fulfill the word of God Amen even the mystery which had been hid from ages and from Generations but now is made manifest to his Saints to whom God would make known what is the riches of the glory of this mystery among the Gentiles which is Christ in you the hope of glory whom we preach warning every man and teaching every man in all wisdom that we may present every man perfect in Christ Jesus where unto I also labor striving according to his working witch worketh in me mightily God bless you may be seated we want to entitle this Christ in you amen amen and for a subject Christ quickens us to action amen so I'll say it like this it what good would it be for Christ to be here if he was not in action in our men's meeting brother Ron brought up the salt of the earth and what good would it be to have a salt shaker on your table if it lost his savior in other words when you put the crystals on your food your French fries or whatever you couldn't taste the salt what good would it be your mouth wasn't even not not having on the table and if you had a candle or a light bulb and and and you put a bushel over it what good would it be to have the light going if it's not able to bring light into the room so what good would it be to be have Christ in our life if he's not working mightily in US Romans 8 tells us that if the spirit of him that raised up Jesus from the dead dwells in you he that raised up Christ from the dead shall also Quicken your mortal Body by his Spirit which which what which dwelleth with you which dwelleth in you amen so if Christ is in us he's going to Quicken us this service is a is kind of for ma mature audiences only we want to challenge ourselves because we want our church to be more mature it isn't how many great ministers we could have here how many great messages they could bring but brother Branham taught us the beauty of the church is the character of the people and if we cannot get the the character that Christ wants us to have before the Rapture what good would it do to have the best services in the world so we're after one thing we're after the manifestation of Christ in our lives so every Church uh has every home as every business has uh problems and where there's people there's problems and our hope is Christ in us the hope of glory the hope of working out problems and and we want we want Christ to work mightily in US now there is the tendency when there's a problem for somebody else to handle it but Christ has caught us to handle it amen and to be honest with you I I want to step in to the role of helping I don't ever want to be found in the eyes of God that I shunned my responsibility of helping I don't want to entertain the thoughts of the devil that tells me that doesn't have anything to do with you I don't want to give myself to a reasons why not to wash somebody's feet why not to humble myself and help a situation if the more personal my relationship was with God the more I'll be letting him work mightily in me amen now we can't do anything ourselves to overcome any problem but our hope is in Jesus Christ not just the hope that Jesus is going to remember us when we're in our situation or a problem but that he's actually going to work inside of us to work out the problem that's our hope it's Christ in us the hope of glory for every situation amen amen too often we take a back seat to the devil let them push us around cause all sorts of problems but Christ the Holy Ghost wants to work mightily inside of us remember that's his desire but it takes courage it takes faith it takes standing up for love [Music] we don't want to be lacking Faith to handle something and we don't want to be lacking commitment amen that's a big one amen amen did you know the number one reason for divorce today is because a lack of commitment it's up 75 percent because of a lack of commitment of course in this age anything goes right it's getting worse and worse 60 percent was too much arguing and too much conflict there's a lacking of commitment 66 percent of men 74 percent of women think that their partner should have worked harder to save the marriage of course it's always the other person right nobody wants to step up and say I'll do whatever I got to do to make things better because I didn't cause the problem it wasn't my fault and I shouldn't have to do it and I got to do all the work in this marriage and oh my you can see the way that the world thinks is so different than the way that Christ thinks the way Christ thinks if you want to be great be a servant of all the way we think is I'll serve what I want if I get something out of it and if I feel I owe it people are falling in love with themselves more and more you know I just I had heard that there's a a lady that married herself it can't get any more you know loving yourself love for others is fading away 75 of the people aren't committed to working out a problem they don't care enough it's no different than our relationships here in church you know Satan does not want us one big happy family in fact the moment we are Satan's got his guns pointed at us because he won't let us stay that way some people would rather run away than work out their problems the scripture tells us that we don't want the sun to go down upon a wrath amen amen that's in our homes right don't let the sun go down upon your Wrath in other words if there's a problem take care of it before you go to sleep so the the mind of Christ the heart of Christ is to fix problems soon amen don't let him Fester don't let them go don't let them keep you know on and on and on and just like always we're doing with that mindset is is expressing that we're not committed we don't care enough and Christ is not really working mightily inside of us right right the natural types of spiritual let's say like this if you're good at working out problems in your home working out problems in church is no different if you're not good at working problems out at home you're probably not good at working up problems in your workplace or in church [Music] Edmund Burke said the only thing necessary for the Triumph of evil is for good men to do nothing what a quote for good men to do nothing there's a problem well you want you want evil to Triumph in the situation do nothing well it's not my responsibility says who says who I mean think about it God even went to Cain all right where's your brother and his attitude is that am I My Brother's Keeper so if he had an expectation of that of Cain how much more the elect how much more of the predestinate how much more the brother and sister are claiming to serve God people are not committed to communicating in love working out their differences but it's easier to talk to others do you know it's easier to talk to other people about a problem you have with somebody else and it is to actually talk to that person that you got a problem with that's true it's true well we can complain about the problems we can murmur under our breath we can even make threats all this stuff solves Discord Division isms and schisms in the church and this is why we need to make sure our Yeezy our neigh is nay and that we are committed to working out problems committed because what good would it be for Christ to be here if he wasn't in action what good was it for Christ to be inside of me if he's not working mightily in me what we need is an old-fashioned trip to the altar need to be values about repenting get our hearts right with God get in sync with the Holy Ghost we need to get the Holy Ghost working back inside of us we need to follow Paul as he followed Christ and in our opening scripture laboring and striving as the Holy Ghost worked in him mightily he was he was he was he would say no God is working mightily in me he he could say that can you say that today can you say the Holy Ghost is working mightily in you come on somebody should be able to say Amen to this one here endeavoring to keep the unity of the spirit and the bond of peace that takes work with all lowliness and meekness and long-suffering and forbearing one another in love how long do we got to do this brother John until we come into the unity of the faith well brother John it's not my fault excuse me what does that have to do with anything are you a Christian only to what's your fault if you're buffeted for your own mistakes and you take it patiently this is an acceptable with God but if you're buffing it for somebody else's mistakes and you take a patient this is acceptable to God so every church every home every workplace is going to have problems and we can run away from them but I guarantee they're going to follow you because they're everywhere problems are a part of life yes the thing is we just don't want to handle problems carnally amen the weapons of our Warfare are not carnal or spiritual we use the Holy Ghost we use love we we use a long-suffering and patience you know the Bible says speak the truth in love now the beauty of problems is God uses them to help mold our character and we need it for a rapture problems are really nothing to fear right but people fear problems all the time and it's because they don't know how to handle them or they just simply don't care enough either way the result is the same the Holy Ghost is not working mightily in them so fear diffuses God working in your life fear and faith cannot coincide brother Branham said either one or the other is in the control tower doubt or faith if we don't have the hope of Christ working in our lives now working our problems how are we going to have faith for a Rapture right amen so if we're not handling problems then we need to get committed to God humble ourselves to seek more of the Holy Ghost spend you know Jesus said these words to the spirit that you and I face every day be zealous and repent and that we face that Spirit every day that spirit that says you don't need to correct lay back you don't need to and his answer was be thou is to repent I'm so glad that Jesus went to Calvary for me amen and I'll tell you if he's the same yesterday tave forever he's going to go to he's going to die out for somebody amen through you he's going to show that same work through you amen so when you and I we see a problem in the church or we encounter a problem if you don't have hope of Christ working mightily inside of you at that time to help then I want you to do this care enough to go get serious with God don't keep coming to church and ignoring what needs to be done don't let the sun go down upon your Wrath don't start isms in the church don't just say oh this this person you know you know how they are well yeah we know how they are but who are you because what we need is Christ in you helping this problem another Brandon said if you see me doing wrong your duty Bound by to come and talk to me about it well they won't listen well I'm sorry you you have a hopeless attitude aren't you glad that Jesus never gave up on you amen and how many times have you sinned over and over and over and yet we ignore that we expect Perfection out of other people no what we need is Christ in US because he'll be just as loving as he was at Calvary he'll be just as long suffering he'll be just as meek he'll meet the need because God is the same yesterday today and forever what we need is we need brothers and sisters to be daring enough to let God work in them to work mightily in them so when people in the church see yes I see Christ in that person look what they're doing they're laying down their life to meet some need that's the church I want to be a part of you know it's not a very big church fear not little flock it's not very big God doesn't need us to talk about problems to other people what he needs is a vessel to work through let them work inside of you say Lord what would you hide me to do and now I don't know what to do I'm okay with not knowing what to do I am not okay with not seeking God to know what to do amen amen that shows your 75 percent uncommitted the bride is committed [Music] we don't need to talk about prime the devil's good enough to talk about power he is the master of uh not only the master deceit but he's the master of accusing the brethren so we don't need that what we need is somebody to love love too often people fear that problems can't be worked out and when you get to that place where you don't think a problem could get worked out then you know what happens Pride enters in Pride because do you think Christ looks at any problem says you know that's too hard for me in fact we have scripture is there anything too hard for God Amen nothing's too hard for God and if God's in you look the Bible says that he would not put anything on you that you could not bear so the moment you think I can't handle this is the moment you're calling Christ a liar and you don't even know it and that's what Satan wants you to do he wants you to call God a liar Proverbs 16 says Pride goeth Before Destruction and a haughty spirit before fall wherefore let him that thinketh thee stand take heed lest he fall there have no temptation taken you but such as coming to man but God is faithful I'm so glad that's in there God is faithful who will not suffer you to be tempted above that which you are able to handle but will with that Temptation also make a way of Escape that you may be able to bear it bear one another's burdens and so fulfill the law of Christ see if Christ is working mildly and you you not scared of anything amen there's nothing to be afraid of we must believe that we can overcome every situation because God is faithful and he's inside of you God is not going to slip up and give you something that's a little bit too hard for you oh I wasn't watching so anytime you're acting like God is not in control of your situation you need to get to the Altar and you need to get reconnected with God John 16 verse 32 Jesus speaking here he says behold the hour cometh yea and is now come that ye shall be scattered and every man to his own and shall leave me alone and yet I am not alone what good words for Jesus everybody left him but his testimony is I'm not alone I wonder can you say that can you say I am not alone but God is the father is with me the Holy Ghost is inside him he's working mightily in me Jesus testimony was because the father is with me and I'll tell you if God be with you who can be against you amen what we're looking for is Believers in this word somebody that can believe this word and make it into action these things have I spoken unto you verse 33 that in me you might have peace in the world you shall have tribulation but be of good cheer I have overcome the world when Christ is inside of us we have the upper advantage we have the overcomer it's not us overcoming it's Christ in US what do we overcome then we overcome getting ourself out of the way well we can get out of the way God can have his way Christ in you the hope of overcoming there's nothing too hard for God nothing to fear just be committed to helping the situation but the brand said the principles of divine heat he said the word of God will defeat the Devil any place anywhere anytime on any condition amen amen well brother John that's for somebody who's got you know real high faith in the word and they're gonna just you know they're standing mightily on the word and they just got so much faith and you know they well I gotta I got a quote for you too I don't believe the weakest Christian is in this church but wherever he's at when he gets on his knees the devil trembles so I think we got ammunition for our situation here God sent the Holy Ghost to run our church amen why did it take so we need more amens to that one and you know the Holy Ghost stays with the word Brian said in the impersonation of Christianity says no but if God meant for us to run his church by denomination or by a Creed the only thing we need is the intelligence of a man right smarter than a man better the smarter the man the better the church but that was not God's program God's program was for the Holy Ghost to run the church the Holy Ghost was given for the church and we can't have two faculties running the church at the same time if man runs it the Holy Ghost goes out if the Holy Ghost runs it usually the man goes out it's just one or the other and I'm just going to say it like this if if Christ is not working mightily in you then you're working you come on to whom you yield yourself servant to obey his servant you are amen it's not about us it's not about our ability to handle situations it's about our faith in God who lives inside of us greater is he that's inside of you than he that's in a problem come on do you if we believe that now we can go into action I don't mean this in any wrong or disrespectful way I do believe in the Bible says honor all men especially those of the household of faith but when your spirit is right your heart is right you will live that word you should better go to anybody about anything and work it through amen now that's the truth amen second Corinthians chapter 3 verse 5 turn with me if you would there second Corinthians chapter 3 verse 5. don't know probably won't be able to get through the whole way you don't know how many times I pray Lord just give me like four scriptures I don't want any notes it just never happens and no matter how much I pray like that for some reason I just gotta teach but I do believe it's his gift amen all right second Corinthians chapter 3 verse 5 says not that we are sufficient of ourselves to think anything of ourselves but our sufficiency is of God Christ Works mightily in us who also has made us able Ministers of the New Testament not of the letter but of the spirit for the letter killeth but the spirit gives life no so you ever been in a fight with your spouse or your child or your mom and your dad and you said something you shouldn't have said might have been the truth might have been the truth but it killed it actually did more damage than good but now you get the right spirit and you speak that truth now that'll bring life to the situation that will help the situation because you can speak the truth in love you can you can't it just has to be the right spirit well how do I know look you don't know whether you got the right Spirit what you're doing don't do it wait till you know that you know that you know that the Holy Ghost is just pulsating you to lay down your life and help somebody because that's how you know if it's the right Spirit Well brother John love is corrective yeah the man who said that gave his life for you love is corrective but that doesn't mean it kills it means it corrects the situation [Music] Jesus one time took a towel and he girded himself and began to wash his disciples feet and he told him he says you don't know what I'm doing now but one day you will he said me being your master Lord you call me I am if I've done that to your feet and you're my servant ought you not to do that to one another that's when you wash you're you're helping you're cleaning you're making it our church needs a constant cleaning we need the we need to be Washed by the Water of the word we need to be uh Robin's shoulders with one another to help one another we need to look for ways I'm telling you if if you if Christ is not working mightily in you it wouldn't matter no matter what you're doing no matter where you're at to be without him working mightily in you is a naked situation it's a naked situation God has made us able ministers all right brother Brian said in a personal experience with God he says I believe that on the day of Pentecost the comforter which is the Holy Spirit was given which is Jesus Christ the spirit given to the church and Jesus lives in his church his people tonight just as he lived with them in a body of Flesh I love this quote I don't mean to get so simple but Christ is in our church Christ is in his people it's the same God that walked in his own Corporal body two thousand years ago with his disciples he's here today inside of each of you now we have the chance to yield our life crucify our flesh and let him work mightily in us or we can start being in control of our own church come on each one of you is a you are the Temple of the Living God you are an individual Church and either Christ is the head of your church or man is before Jesus left he told his disciples he would not leave them comfortless he said I will come to you and in John 14 16 it says and I pray and I will pray the father that he'll give you another comforter that he may what abide with you forever well brother John I'm going to be honest with you I just don't feel him abiding it doesn't seem like he's abiding okay okay what are you gonna do what are you going to do are you going to allow the sun to go down upon your wrath with God are you going to make that your life or you're going to say I'm going to get serious with God and take care of business every single person is responsible for their own walk with God the church is not responsible for your relationship it's not you don't care enough to take care of your relationship with God don't you blame the church for your situation come on we need more than just what we're getting on two services in fact if you're not doing good in your personal law walk you're probably not getting much out of the services true all right verse 17 even the spirit of Truth whom the world cannot receive because it seeth him not neither knoweth him but you know him for he dwelleth with you and shall be in you so here we're testifying either Christ is in me working mightily or you know what my hands are up I just don't know what's going on but we need him to work out problems we just need it amen amen we can't well that's the pastor's business is it we don't have a body it's just a pastor and then one oh we're a body it's a body Ministry there's things that you say and do and happen and you don't shake one another's hand and thoughts come into your head and you got all this stuff going on you got to take care of that you've got to take care of that it's not the pastor's job I like what Jesus said right before he left when he told him teaching them to observe all things whatsoever commanded you and lo I Am With You Always even to the end of the world there is no excuse for God not working mightily in US amen amen brother Brandon said in the message of the law having a shadow he said the Holy Ghost don't change it's the same every time every time every time he says it three times you know what I'm beginning to think question that a lot of times people get one another's ghost instead of the Holy Ghost he says you watch them the way they act I'm telling you I I don't know if you you I can watch people who've been around other people and see they're acting just like that person yeah and I used to watch that with my children a lot because when they'd hang out with certain friends we do pick up one another Spirit we don't even realize it and what we really need is to spend more time with the Holy Ghost says you go into a church where the pastor is kind of flighty yeah Wildfire up wild fire it up and overnight watch the congregation be the same thing I don't want to be flighty and I Want to Be Wild and only fire it up I just want to be genuine I just want to be genuine brother I'm telling you it behooves you to get down and pray to God until the real Christian spirit moves in your heart and it settles all problems did you hear that when the holy spirit moves in your heart it settles all problems but if I just get this brother's Spirit or that brother Spirit it ain't going to solve any problem especially if you get a spirit under on you that doesn't like to solve problems hey you got a spirit on you that likes to talk about problems you'll talk about problems more you get a spirit on you that just you know is bothered fears hey you'll just get bothered in your fear you get a a a a a a proud uh you hang around saying that's real arrogant well you're gonna get arrogant I mean Spirits get on people it happened in brother by Adam's meetings they just went one from another and evil spirits were getting another people it's a real thing and you need to believe the word of God you need to hold to this word all right now the worshiper once purged how does it do brother Ram says when the life of the sacrifice comes back to the worshiper then it's meekness its patience its gentleness it's long-suffering it's goodness it's faith brother Brian says see what I mean do we see what brother branham's saying when we get the Holy Ghost then we've got Galatians 5 22. but if we get somebody else's ghost then we'll probably be expressing their fruits and you get the Life of Christ you have brother Adam says you have what you need to work out problems and that's what we're looking for to a spiritual Christian they have a god-given responsibility to help other people besides themselves Smith's wiggleworth said with every Revelation comes a responsibility now when the devil is accusing the Brethren okay so the devil could come to every one of us here and just tell something bad about somebody right now we would say oh wow that's terrible and one word I think we're doing the right thing well we'll just pray for him okay and then do nothing else we have a responsibility now I'm not saying it's your job to get in everybody's business but what I am saying is when the Devil comes and he talks to us and we don't do nothing we don't feel a responsibility I'm going to tell you you didn't get a revelation from God you just heard the whisper of the enemy and you thought it was God because if God speaks to you he expects you to do something with that and I'm telling you we're talking about maturing in our church that's what we're talking about and how many would like to see our church more mature to be able to have uh uh consolation that we rub shoulders with Believers that care that there's a real Comfort into that Brandon said it if God has changed us we are obligated to go help others so has God changed you okay then let's go help somebody so now this this there's got there's something in this message for everybody and let's just say we got some some men that are veterans in this gospel and they can teach the younger ones how to work out a problem if they hear about a problem so there's something in this for all of us amen all right Galatians chapter 6 verse number one brethren if I be overtaken in a fault I'm just playing this personally ye which are spiritual restore me in a spirit of meekness considering yourself thus you also be tempted so look at the responsibility here of course if you're not spiritual then you're not spiritual but remember that remember you're not spiritual oh my bear ye one another's burden and so fulfill the law of Christ to the spiritual believer we need to wash some one one another's feet the goal is to bring restoration not to tell a fault not to kill with the letter but to restore with the spirit someone's going to live this gospel somebody's going to live this gospel somebody's going to fulfill the law of Christ brother Brandon said then Jesus came and called he says that ought to shake us and make us get out of our Slumber that that we're in that lukewarm but you know the Bible says that we have to get that way so he can spew the whole thing out of his mouth did he promise it yes he did we all know he promised it and he will do it the whole church is spewed from his mouth them then then out of the church Comes the Bride the elected so when you start living this part of the Gospel you're showing that you're elect yes you're manifesting you're spiritual you're showing your great by washing other people's feet verse 3 for if a man think himself to be something when he's not he deceives himself but let every man prove his own work and then shall have rejoicing in himself alone and not in another for every man shall bear his own burden let him that is taught in the word communicate unto him that teacheth in all good things be not deceived God is Not Mott for whatsoever man saw it that shall he also rape for he that soweth to his flesh shall reap uh shall of the flesh reap corruption but he that sold to the spirit shall the spirit reap Everlast life Everlasting so what's the answer what do we do brother John let us not be weary in well-doing for in due season we shall reap on the church if we faint not amen I love this word I love building I love building and verse 10. as we have therefore opportunity let us do good unto all men especially unto them who are the household of faith so if you have a chance to help somebody restore somebody build if we have opportunity let's do it let's do good let's put it into action let's go let God Work mightily in you Ryan said the message perfect strength by Perfect weakness he said that's what we have to do today that's what I that's what I need that's what every man needs it's a loss of himself a loss of his ability a loss of what he is that he might have a complete yielding to the Holy Ghost amen the housewife needs that the Schoolboy needs that even our children our little children he said God uses problems in the church to temper the body don't be scared of problems they're there for a reason God knows what he's doing to neutralize to counterbalance the body to make the body more flexible to be able to handle diversity and problems or differences I mean can you imagine raising a child who can't come to an adulthood how hard that would be and there were some 1.8 million you know that came out of Egypt that never could come to the maturity of going into the Promised Land they stayed back they made excuses they murmured they complained they blame Moses they blame Aaron they blamed even Joshua and Caleb look you never heard Joshua and Caleb complaining never heard him murmuring brother Brandon says God will put certain people in their Church body just to help your character [Music] so why why would you be bothered because your your feathers are getting ruffled when God put that there directly to help your character that's how much God loves you God knows what he's doing the message of resurrection of Lazarus Brethren says think you're not strange that the fiery Trials come because it's the only it's only done to perfect your faith and to draw you closer all right Ephesians chapter four are we getting something out of this are you going to help me to help the church amen Ephesians chapter 4 verse 14 that we henceforth be no more children toss to and fro and carried about with every win of Doctrine by the slight of men cunning craftiness whereby they lie and wait to deceive but speaking the truth in love May grow up into him in All Things which is the head even Christ from whom the whole body now look at this the whole church is fitly joined together and compacted by that which every joint IT Supplies something to help according to the effectual working there it is again in the measure of every part making increase of the body unto the edifying of itself in love Hallelujah I'll tell you I got my sight shot on this today it may not be your heart's desire but I'll say where is God where is God's heart amen I know the Bible tells me he that's faithful and little is faithful and much I want to be faithful with what he's given me I want to be able you know I don't I don't even I I don't mean it wrong but I don't want any reward when I get to heaven if I get to heaven if I could just make it in and hear him say Well done that's it for me I don't need to be over any cities I don't I don't need anything else I just don't want to displease the Lord amen and here's the thing he's given us all these trials and all the things that we go through to prove where we're standing with God so we can know first of all God doesn't want us to be tossed about with every little problem that happens get bent out of shape because this happened that happened this brother did this sister did that God doesn't want that we need to mature that's not how we react Brother John who are you speaking to I'm speaking to anybody that wants to act like that and if if you don't act like that then praise God I'm not speaking to you these are the Holy Ghost when there's problems God wants to use us now we've got to step into the situation not tossed about but with our head on straight A sound mind God has not given us a spirit of fear but Power love and a sound mind I'm gonna walk into this situation and I'm going to help it and if you don't know what to do that second go pray but don't get in the habit of just not caring and caring and caring and not dealing with it because your whole Walk In Christ will become that way God's remedy for growing up is to literally speak truth and love that's how you grow up speak truth in love can you uh imagine we got a little uh Emma here can you imagine grandpa just really spanking her to she's black and blue because she don't know how to drive a car yet be terrible God's not going to put anything on us that we can't bear I would never put that on her and if I asked her to do something that she could do maybe pick up a toy God is required me to speak the truth in love now if I had all my seven children here lined up and they had all my men at Work lined up and I asked them have you ever heard me yell at you did I ever ever yell at you in all your life foreign but if I ask them did I ever speak the truth to you oh they at all say yeah you can speak the truth in love you don't have to yell you don't have to get angry you don't have to get upset you don't have to say well you know that look if you don't care enough to help your brother and sister what good is it have in Christ in the church if he's not in action what good is it to have some big light if it's on a bushel there's no light shining what good is it to have this great salt shaker in your life but he can't have a great flavor for what's coming forth from you are you with me so we need to speak the truth in love too many people get stuck in just speaking the truth and Hate Romans 5 5 says and hope maketh not a shame because the love of God is shed abroad in our hearts by the Holy Ghost which is given unto us so we have God inside of us to have them working mightily inside of us is to restore to work out problems to to help for me to go to a church for me to go into work and expect my men not to scrap a job to expect my men not to be moody not to be sick not to be in a bad mood not to care at times to ever have that mentality would be utterly wrong people are going to come in here and they're going to do the wrong thing that just gives you an opportunity to go help well brother John I don't want to help because it offended me well then my suggestion to you is get along with God but don't let the sun go down on your wrath anymore you've got to change that you've got to change that you've got to start getting serious this is not a place that you just come for only what you want this is a place you come to help your brothers and sisters and if you don't feel that love you don't feel that burden I'll say you need to get you need to get along with God because I don't care how you slice it you're part of a body and the body needs you and you need the body imagine you you got so mad at everybody at the church that you just cut them out you can't even have faith in their prayers praying for you because you cut them out right I know this is this is uh this is about helping us get mature and uh Maybe some of us haven't experienced anything like this oh praise the Lord but maybe some of us have and God wants us to bow to handle it the right way I know time is up but I want to just read First Corinthians Chapter 13 Verse 4. foreign now we're going to speak the truth in love right we're going to speak the truth and love I got um some some good news I'm not going to do all my notes so that's good news but okay if you're going to speak the truth in love how do I do that Brother John First Corinthians chapter 13 verse 4 says charity suffereth long amen amen and it's kind charity Envy not vaunteth not itself and it's not puffed up you know the worst thing you could do is be puffed up talking to somebody it does not behave itself unseemingly and it doesn't even seek its own in other words when you speak the truth and love it's not about you it's not about you it's about the person you're talking to it's not easily provoked and it doesn't sit there thinking evil it rejoices not in iniquity but rejoices in the truth it Bears all things I love that amen no laziness in this thing it believes all things that hopes all things that endures all things and charity never quits it never fails praise the Lord so when there are problems the body needs to be fitly joined together not disconnected not disjointed at one part of the body not sowing Discord not in any essence or schisms or I can talk to you know certain people about this in the church but I can't look don't talk to anybody about anything except the person that God has put on your heart to go help the scripture teaches to do that Jesus taught to do that golden that don't work take another brother with you but more than more more than anything you know everybody in here is so willing to make things better we got a good church I'm so thankful I'm so thankful that the Holy Ghost runs the church and it's okay that I don't know what's going on as long as God does he can take care of it he can he can address what needs to be addressed we want God to supply every need of this body and we want him to work inside of us effectually work inside of us let's Stand Together mightily working inside of us I can do all things through Christ he's the one that strengthens me I can't do nothing of myself but I can do all things through Christ who strengthen me can I give you one more scripture while you're standing and this is like so powerful first John chapter 3 verse 8. he that commit the sin is of the devil for the devil said it from the beginning this is where I want to get to for this purpose the Son of God was manifested that he might destroy the works of the devil the manifestation of Christ in our church will destroy the works of the devil so a soft answer turns away raft it's the manifestation of Christ that destroys the devil remember when brother Branham he came home from a missionary trip one time and the whole house was out of Rey and kids were jumping around and the wife was all tore up and well what was needed was Christ in action he just put his little apron on he started helping his darling with the dishes just started humming before you knew it created a whole new atmosphere what was it it wasn't just God and a prophet it was the manifestation of Christ at that moment that's what's needed in a church it's Christ in action blessed are the peacemakers blessed are they that are merciful see it's the manifestation of Christ that's our hope amen Christ in you the hope of glory amen you got a song on your heart got a song you'd like to play all is well amen all is well all is well we have heard the message alone and all is well very there is a place of perfect rest behind the nervous soul rest little bride rest for all is well all is worth all all is well we have
