[30:40] Amen. God bless you today. If you turn
[30:42] with me in the Bibles to the book of
[30:45] Revelations chapter 3,
[30:50] um when I had heard uh about Brother
[30:54] Johnson, um I was sad that um he was
[31:00] going
[31:01] down and just wanting to spend a little
[31:05] bit more time with him. And
[31:10] um but I knew that in my my thought it
[31:14] was selfish
[31:17] because he's by far.
[31:20] He's in the place that he's longed to
[31:22] be. And to think that this man
[31:27] um knew that no one else would want to
[31:31] miss it. spent his
[31:34] life trying to convince others how
[31:37] important it is to make heaven your
[31:41] home. We we we love him and we we're
[31:47] going to miss him and we look forward
[31:50] to spending eternity with him. And I'm
[31:56] so glad that I listened to the call.
[32:00] Amen. Amen.
[32:02] We'll maybe say just a few more words uh
[32:05] about brother Johnson, but let's look to
[32:07] God in prayer and then we'll read the
[32:09] scriptures and have you be
[32:11] seated. Our heavenly father, we thank
[32:15] you for these that have gathered out
[32:18] today to be in your house,
[32:23] Lord, to to be in your presence and to
[32:27] feed from the word of God today.
[32:31] Uh we pray Lord that you would move in a
[32:34] very personal way in each of our lives
[32:36] here today. That we could all receive
[32:40] from
[32:41] you a part of your word that
[32:45] would grant to us a closer walk with you
[32:49] and that we might be prepared for your
[32:54] coming. Lord
[32:55] Jesus, we pray Lord that you would
[32:59] remember
[33:00] uh Sister Johnson and the children and
[33:06] the spouses and the grandchildren
[33:10] um Lord and that thou would remember the
[33:14] thousands upon thousands Lord that are
[33:17] remembering
[33:19] uh brother Johnson today and the days to
[33:22] come that you would be their strength
[33:23] and their comfort. comfort, oh God. And
[33:26] may there be uh a great rejoicing in
[33:30] their hearts just knowing, Lord, that
[33:33] brother Johnson has gone on to receive
[33:35] his reward.
[33:37] Lord, we thank you with all of our heart
[33:40] for for him in our lives and what he has
[33:43] done to help
[33:46] us to be where we are. Lord God, we just
[33:52] worship you and thank you for it. God,
[33:55] may you come now and bless the remainder
[33:58] of this service. Bless this word, thy
[34:01] word to our heart as we commit it to you
[34:04] in the precious name of Jesus Christ we
[34:07] pray. Amen. Amen. Now, we're going to
[34:10] read in Revelations chapter 3 before
[34:12] you're seated with the Leodysian church
[34:15] starting with verse number 14.
[34:19] And unto the angel of the church of
[34:24] Leodysia, write these things, sayeth the
[34:26] Amen, the faithful, the true witness,
[34:29] the beginning of the creation of God. I
[34:32] know thy works, that thou art neither
[34:34] cold nor hot. I would that thou work
[34:37] cold or hot. And so then, because you're
[34:40] not either of those, and
[34:43] lukewarm, neither cold or hot, I will
[34:46] spew thee out of my
[34:48] mouth. Because thou sayest, I am rich,
[34:51] and increase with goods, and have need
[34:54] of nothing, and knowest not that thou
[34:56] art
[34:57] wretched, miserable, and poor, and
[34:59] blind, and naked. I counsel thee to buy
[35:02] of me gold tried in the fire that thou
[35:05] mayest be rich in white raignment that
[35:08] thou mayest be
[35:09] clothed. The shame of thy nakedness do
[35:12] not appear and anoint thine eyes with
[35:15] eyes hath that thou mayest see as many
[35:17] as I love I rebuke and chasen be zalious
[35:20] therefore and repent. Behold I stand at
[35:22] the door and knock. If any man hear my
[35:25] voice, open the door, I will come into
[35:28] him and will s with him and he with me.
[35:31] To him that overcomemeth, why grant to
[35:33] sit with me on my throne? Even as I also
[35:36] overcame and am set down with my father
[35:39] in his throne. He that have an ear, let
[35:42] him hear what the spirit saith unto the
[35:45] churches. Amen. Amen. God bless you. You
[35:47] may be seated. Now knows how important
[35:49] it is to hear what the spirit is saying
[35:51] to the church. How else will we really
[35:54] even understand what it means to buy of
[35:57] him gold tried in the fire? How will we
[35:59] know what it means to have our eyes
[36:01] anointed with Isaf and our ears cleaned
[36:04] out? I went to the doctor um here just
[36:07] uh this week. Um and he well actually it
[36:11] was uh two weeks ago and um he looked in
[36:14] my left ear and he saw that uh there was
[36:17] wax in my ear. He said, "You you have
[36:19] some wax in there." And um I just
[36:23] thought, "Okay." And because I remember
[36:25] they're having some wax in there one
[36:27] time before, maybe a couple times
[36:29] before, and I couldn't quite hear. I
[36:31] would like wake up on the side of my
[36:33] pillow and I couldn't hear if I'm laying
[36:35] on this side, and I still couldn't hear
[36:37] very well, very well, because there's
[36:39] like a humidifier thing going on. And
[36:43] um so what I would do is I would get uh
[36:46] some peroxide and I would lay down and
[36:48] I'd let the peroxide begin to get it out
[36:51] and I could finally hear. So when he
[36:54] told me that last time, um I I thought I
[36:58] could hear, but he still said there was
[37:00] wax in there. So I went ahead and I
[37:01] worked on that and got that out. So when
[37:03] I went and seen him again for just my
[37:06] normal checkup, um he said, "Yeah, it
[37:09] looks a lot better." And you know, how
[37:11] how do we know that when we're properly
[37:14] hearing the word of God?
[37:17] We we need we need God to open our ears.
[37:22] Amen. To open our eyes, to give us
[37:25] understanding so we know how to properly
[37:28] be prepared to meet the Lord. And we
[37:32] want to entitle this message today,
[37:34] hearing and responding. Hearing and
[37:36] responding. And I might want to say uh
[37:39] as a subject hearing personally from God
[37:42] and responding back to God. When I think
[37:44] about uh brother Johnson, there was a
[37:46] time that he had come out of his uh
[37:49] schooling and he was seeking the Lord uh
[37:53] about where to go and um they had been
[37:57] praying and and fasting and and God had
[38:00] given him a little vision where he had
[38:03] heard come up to Ann Arbor to help us.
[38:07] And we've heard this story before. Um,
[38:11] and the the beauty of this, he didn't
[38:13] even know Ann Arbor.
[38:16] Didn't know. Um, but he heard that and
[38:20] he responded. Amen.
[38:23] He heard and he responded. And because
[38:25] he responded, I'm here today. Amen. I'm
[38:29] here. And I'll tell you there, we
[38:31] wouldn't have a church here today. We
[38:33] wouldn't we wouldn't have our children
[38:34] would we wouldn't have what we have if
[38:37] it had not been for that man responding
[38:40] to the call. And I'm thinking if that
[38:43] man could do that and cause all this
[38:46] wonderful people to make it to
[38:49] heaven, how much more should we be able
[38:52] to hear from God and respond to God?
[38:54] Amen. You know, we may not hear, you
[38:57] know, go to this city or go to that, but
[39:00] he could tell us something that would be
[39:01] just as important for us to do. Amen.
[39:04] And it's important that we respond to
[39:08] God. So, we want to talk a little bit
[39:10] about this. I had called left a message.
[39:12] I think it was with brother uh Paul um
[39:15] Johnson today and I just thanked him for
[39:17] the sacrifice that he made all the years
[39:21] with his that his dad could help so many
[39:24] people get to heaven because you know
[39:27] it's a hard time right now for them and
[39:32] and and to know that your sacrifice
[39:35] helped a lot of people and uh God God
[39:38] bless the Martin family. Amen. and all
[39:41] those uh family members that have to
[39:44] sacrifice so much for the ministry.
[39:46] Amen. Amen.
[39:48] Now, our bodies have five gates. I want
[39:51] to talk about these five gates just a
[39:52] second. See, taste, feel, hear, and
[39:55] smell. Now, with these five gates, our
[39:58] bodies, they make contact with the world
[40:00] that we live in. Amen. If we hear mom
[40:04] calling us for dinner and we walk out,
[40:06] we smell something good cooking. We sit
[40:10] down in the table and we see a a
[40:12] beautiful spread and after we pray, we
[40:16] feel the texture of the biscuits, the
[40:18] homemade biscuits, and we slap some
[40:20] butter on it and it and we taste the
[40:22] goodness all right there through those
[40:25] five gates. that happens
[40:28] and all these things process through the
[40:32] through the faculty of our mind and we
[40:34] make all these decisions of it smells
[40:36] good, doesn't smell good, tastes good,
[40:38] doesn't taste good, feels good, doesn't
[40:40] feel good. It all happens in our mind.
[40:43] Our minds use these five gates to
[40:45] contact the world that we live in. But
[40:47] if we ever want to make contact with
[40:49] God, we need to make contact through our
[40:52] heart. Amen.
[40:54] Amen.
[40:56] So, we don't want to come to church and
[40:58] think that we're hearing from
[41:00] God from our ears.
[41:04] I wonder what he's going to speak. I
[41:06] wonder what scripture is going to be
[41:07] being used. We're not hearing from God
[41:10] in our ears. We got to get this
[41:12] straight. If we want to hear from God,
[41:14] we got to start listening inside of our
[41:16] heart. Amen.
[41:18] Our hearts also have ears and they have
[41:22] a mouth. Our heart can
[41:25] speak and our ears can hear the and the
[41:28] ears of our heart can hear. Now the
[41:30] problem with too many people is they
[41:32] they have thoughts in their heart that
[41:34] are completely contrary to what comes
[41:36] out of their mouth.
[41:41] Jesus speaking to the Pharisees. He said
[41:43] in Matthew 15:7, "Ye hypocrites," well
[41:46] did Isaiah's prophesy of you, saying,
[41:49] "This people draw nigh unto me with
[41:51] their mouth." In other words, they're
[41:54] singing the songs. They're saying praise
[41:57] and they honor me with their lips. But
[42:00] look, their heart is far from me.
[42:03] showing there's a separation between
[42:06] what happens in the head and what
[42:08] happens in the heart. Amen.
[42:12] Now our mouth can say one thing and our
[42:15] heart can say something completely
[42:17] different.
[42:18] Amen. Jesus said in Luke 6:45, "A good
[42:22] man out of the good treasures of his
[42:24] heart bringeth forth that which is good,
[42:26] and an evil man out of the evil treasure
[42:28] of his heart bringeth forth that which
[42:30] is evil. for of the abundance
[42:35] of the heart. Amen. The mouth speaketh.
[42:38] Amen.
[42:40] So that shows me that there could be a
[42:44] lot of things in our heart that we don't
[42:46] speak.
[42:47] Every tree is known by its fruit. Jesus
[42:50] said, "So for out of the abundance of
[42:52] the heart, the mouth speaketh."
[42:57] So what's going on in our
[42:59] heart? Our hearts can have mixed
[43:02] motives. That could be good. It could be
[43:05] bad. And it could be
[43:09] ugly. All
[43:11] happening. We've all experienced someone
[43:14] saying one thing but really believing
[43:16] something different. Yes. Amen. Someone
[43:19] talking to us about one thing, but
[43:20] they're really wanting something else.
[43:22] We've all experienced that. The
[43:24] capability of conveying one thing to
[43:26] somebody, but really something
[43:28] different's happening inside.
[43:31] showing that there's a a difference
[43:33] what's happening in the mind to make
[43:36] those words come out when our heart is
[43:38] in a different
[43:40] spot. Jeremiah 17:9 says the heart is
[43:45] deceitful above all and desperately
[43:49] wicked. Who can know
[43:52] it? Who can know it? It's a good
[43:55] question. It takes God to actually show
[43:57] us with our within our heart. Amen.
[44:01] You don't even have to talk to a
[44:03] Christian and they'll they'll tell you
[44:05] they know their heart.
[44:09] But even a Christian needs God to show
[44:11] them what's in their heart, right?
[44:15] Because our heart is deceitful. And
[44:18] what's so strange about this is we'll
[44:20] trust our deceitful heart above what the
[44:25] word of God says.
[44:32] We don't really know. We need God.
[44:33] Hebrews 4:12 says, "For the word of God
[44:36] is quick and powerful and sharper than
[44:38] any two-edged sword, piercing even to
[44:41] the dividing of sunder of soul and
[44:42] spirit and of the joints and marrow and
[44:45] is a discerner of the thoughts and
[44:47] intents of the heart." Right? Amen. It
[44:51] can
[44:52] separate. It can divide us under the
[44:55] soul and the spirit. the joints and the
[44:58] marorrow. The marrow that's in the bones
[45:01] and is a
[45:03] discerner of the thoughts and tents of
[45:05] heart. That was one of the great things
[45:07] that caught our attention in the
[45:09] ministry of brother Brandham because God
[45:11] used him to discern the thoughts and the
[45:13] tents of man's
[45:15] heart. It got our attention and we say
[45:19] now man can't do that. That had to be
[45:22] God in brother Random. Amen. That's
[45:23] right.
[45:25] But you know that same God is here every
[45:27] time we come to church and the word is
[45:28] being preached.
[45:31] But
[45:32] because a brother is not standing up
[45:35] here calling out our name and saying we
[45:38] live at so and so this happened to you
[45:40] so and so that we don't think that it's
[45:44] God. We just sometimes well
[45:48] that's that's just a
[45:51] coincidence. There are times that we
[45:53] say, "Hey, did you tell brother
[45:56] John?" Sometimes we hear
[45:58] that. Sometimes we think, "How did he
[46:01] know? How did brother John
[46:04] know?" But for whatever reason, we don't
[46:06] want to give God credit for preaching
[46:08] the word. Like God is God's word comes
[46:13] forth and somehow it has a way of
[46:17] speaking to our hearts. Amen.
[46:21] It's and sometimes we miss it because
[46:24] we're we're hearing God with these ears
[46:27] and this understanding, this intellect,
[46:29] and we're really missing God speaking to
[46:31] our heart.
[46:33] Verse 13 says, "Neither is there any
[46:35] creature that is not manifest in his
[46:37] sight, but all things are naked and open
[46:40] unto the eyes of him of whom we have to
[46:43] do." How many has to do with the Lord?
[46:46] Amen. How many belongs to the Lord? That
[46:49] means everything. God sees everything in
[46:52] our lives. Amen. Amen. Now, those of us
[46:58] that um I'll just say it like this. It
[47:00] takes a humble heart to ask God to show
[47:03] them their heart. It does. It takes a
[47:06] humble heart. It takes a brave heart to
[47:09] discover what's hidden inside. It's
[47:11] true. Because a lot of times we don't
[47:13] really want to know. We don't want to
[47:15] deal with it. True, but it can only be
[47:18] done through the word of God.
[47:21] Brother Brandham said, "We come to
[47:23] church to find out where we're at with
[47:24] God." So that word comes forth and it
[47:27] speaks to our heart. We may not even uh
[47:30] psychologically maybe agree with with
[47:34] what's being said, but somehow through
[47:36] that message, God has a way of speaking
[47:39] to our heart.
[47:43] Now, that's not why everybody comes to
[47:44] church, though. Brother Bam said
[47:47] that's what we come to church for. But
[47:49] that's not why everybody comes to
[47:51] church. But it ought to be our number
[47:54] one reason. Amen. To allow the word of
[47:56] God to discern our life. Amen. Because
[48:00] if if anything's going to be real with
[48:01] God, like if we're going to make it to
[48:03] heaven, we will make it to heaven in
[48:06] with a real relationship. Yeah, we will
[48:09] not make it to heaven on a fake
[48:10] relationship. We will not make it to
[48:13] heaven faking it.
[48:16] It'll either be real or we'll miss it.
[48:18] Because God don't have any fake in
[48:20] heaven.
[48:24] Psalms 119 105 says, "Thy word is a lamp
[48:28] unto my feet and a light unto my path."
[48:32] We want the word of God to be preached
[48:34] to us so we can see how does it fit in
[48:36] my life. It shines in our life and it
[48:39] lets us know whether we're where we need
[48:41] to be or if we got to move over into the
[48:43] light. Walk in the light as he is in the
[48:46] light. Right? Whatever God shows you,
[48:48] just walk in it. Amen.
[48:52] That's what that's it's real. It's it's
[48:55] so real.
[48:58] All we need to do is trust the word of
[49:00] God above
[49:01] our feelings and
[49:04] emotions, our our our own intellect, our
[49:06] own understanding for guidance for our
[49:10] lives. Without the word of God, we won't
[49:12] have a light. We won't have a compass.
[49:14] We won't have a sense of direction for
[49:16] our lives. Without the word of God, we
[49:19] won't even understand when God speaks to
[49:21] us. I'll never ever forget this. God
[49:24] speaking to me and I just didn't get
[49:26] what he was saying.
[49:29] It was young in my my of course we know
[49:32] this
[49:34] um just in the story of of of
[49:38] um Samuel when Samuel when God was
[49:41] calling
[49:42] Samuel and he heard but he didn't know
[49:47] God. It was God calling him. He had to
[49:50] have somebody else tell him. Next time
[49:52] just say, "Here am I, Lord."
[49:55] And I remember young in my ministry and
[49:57] the Lord speaking to me and you know,
[49:59] I'm so used to hearing like this. Just
[50:03] make it raise in my ear. I understand
[50:05] here. I didn't never understood God
[50:07] speaking to my
[50:09] heart. But he don't speak here. I know
[50:13] prophecies come here and I know we got
[50:15] to hear the word of God through here.
[50:17] But we if we don't hear with our heart,
[50:19] we're not going to hear God. Amen. We're
[50:21] going to hear a devil telling us
[50:24] something that really isn't there.
[50:26] Too many people are just satisfied with
[50:28] hearing up here and never hearing in
[50:30] their heart.
[50:33] Jesus speaking in John 8:43, he says,
[50:36] "Why do you not understand my
[50:39] speech even because you cannot hear my
[50:44] word?" Right?
[50:47] If we do not have an ear of our
[50:52] heart to
[50:54] hear God's word, we will never hear
[50:58] God's
[50:59] word. God did not get my attention on
[51:03] the news watching it with these
[51:05] eyes listening to the words in these
[51:09] ears. God spoke here.
[51:12] God gave all of us ears to hear what the
[51:16] spirit is saying to us. Amen.
[51:19] And those ears, when we listen with
[51:23] those ears and we respond, it will lead
[51:27] and guide us into all truth.
[51:33] We do not understand, we'll never be
[51:35] able to
[51:38] follow God into or as Jesus said into
[51:42] the
[51:43] regeneration. Jesus talking to Peter, he
[51:46] says, "I understand that you left houses
[51:49] and you left family to follow me, but
[51:52] you need to continue following me into a
[51:55] new birth, into a bornagain experience
[51:58] to where your nature's changed. And if
[52:00] that doesn't happen, you haven't really
[52:02] reached the goal. And that's the same
[52:04] thing about coming out. I know you came
[52:06] out of Egypt. I know you
[52:08] rejoiced. I know you you your shoes
[52:11] didn't wear out. You drank from the
[52:12] well. Uh I I know you were blessed, but
[52:17] you got to follow me into the promised
[52:18] land. Amen. And I'll just say, we're
[52:21] sitting here in church, but God's
[52:23] calling you somewhere.
[52:25] God's calling you somewhere. He called,
[52:28] he didn't say to brother Johnson, to his
[52:31] son, our brother, um, he didn't say,
[52:34] "All right, you you're born
[52:37] again. You You made it through."
[52:41] No, you got a job to do.
[52:45] You belong to
[52:46] God. God wants to use
[52:49] you. And you need to be responding to
[52:53] when God speaks to you. Got to respond.
[52:55] You just can't sit there and say, "I
[52:56] heard God speak. I knew God was in the
[52:59] service." You've got to respond. Amen.
[53:01] Because that's the only way to get to
[53:03] the next step. Amen. How was I going to
[53:05] get saved if he didn't? Brother Johnson
[53:08] didn't go to Ann Arbor.
[53:12] Well, you know, God would have used
[53:13] somebody else. Well, I'm telling you
[53:14] what, God has a plan
[53:19] and it has to happen by the plan.
[53:23] We don't make the plan up because if we
[53:26] want to think like that, then nothing
[53:28] matters, but everything matters. The
[53:31] steps of a righteous man are ordered of
[53:34] the Lord. They that are the sons of God
[53:36] are led by the spirit of God.
[53:39] So, we have a part to
[53:41] play. And I just I just want to believe
[53:44] in being in the perfect will of God.
[53:46] Amen.
[53:48] Now when the word of God goes inside of
[53:50] our heart then our heart will follow God
[53:55] right but if the word of God is only in
[53:59] our head we will not follow God
[54:05] and what I mean by that is you'll be up
[54:08] one minute down the
[54:10] next trying to do good one moment and
[54:13] the next I I'm not there.
[54:18] But when it comes into the heart, it's
[54:20] settled. It don't matter how you're
[54:23] feeling. Don't matter what intellect's
[54:25] going on. Don't matter what hindrances.
[54:27] You understand that you're going to
[54:29] follow
[54:30] God. And this is why it's important to
[54:32] hear with your heart. And don't be
[54:34] satisfied with sitting in church and
[54:36] just hearing from your ears. God isn't
[54:39] there. God isn't here. God is not here
[54:42] in our intellect.
[54:45] He is here in our heart. He said, "I
[54:47] stand at the door and I knock." That is
[54:50] the door of our heart. And the quicker
[54:53] we can get to where our heart is when
[54:55] we're in church, the quicker we can get
[54:56] somewhere with God.
[55:04] In Matthew 11:1 15, Jesus says these
[55:07] words, "He that have ears to hear, let
[55:12] him hear.
[55:15] Now this phrase he that have ears to
[55:18] hear is
[55:21] um spoken seven times in the
[55:24] gospels. Seven times he uses this word
[55:28] ears. But when he gets
[55:32] to But after, if I could say it like
[55:36] this, after the Holy Ghost comes down in
[55:39] the day of Pentecost, now he's speaking
[55:41] to the church
[55:42] ages. To the church ages, he doesn't use
[55:45] plural ears. He uses singular
[55:50] ear meaning we hear with our
[55:57] heart and but when Jesus was speaking to
[56:01] the
[56:02] Pharisees they the word wasn't inside
[56:05] they couldn't understand it had
[56:07] everything had to be processed through
[56:09] here and then into here. Amen.
[56:12] But after the Holy Ghost comes, we don't
[56:15] use these ears to hear anymore.
[56:18] We come to church and it don't matter if
[56:21] the song is our favorite or if it's one
[56:23] that we haven't heard in a while. Our
[56:27] heart is listening to the song, right?
[56:30] And our heart is listening to the word.
[56:33] We're we're waiting for God to speak to
[56:35] us. We're like hungering and thirsting.
[56:38] Not with these ears, not with intellect,
[56:40] not to grow, cuz knowledge puffth up,
[56:42] but we're looking in our heart. God,
[56:45] speak to my heart. Amen. And the only
[56:47] way that you're going to hear God speak
[56:49] to
[56:50] you. I'm not saying he don't call
[56:53] sometimes because he gives everybody a
[56:55] chance. But the prophet told us he's
[56:59] only obligated to call us one
[57:03] time. After you call us one
[57:06] time, we need to get desperate in
[57:09] wanting to hear from God because God
[57:11] wants to see our heart say, "God, speak
[57:13] to me. I am sincere. I'm serious. God,
[57:18] speak to my
[57:20] heart. I got all this knowledge. I can
[57:23] quote the verses. I've been going to
[57:25] church, but I'm interested in knowing
[57:27] you, Lord. Speak to my heart."
[57:30] Speak to my
[57:32] heart. Our opening scripture, he that
[57:35] have an ear to hear, let him hear what
[57:38] the spirit saith un this is also spoken
[57:42] seven
[57:44] times. Seven
[57:46] times, each for each church age, which
[57:50] spans over 2,000 years to the
[57:55] Gentiles. He deals with them on an
[57:57] individual
[57:59] basis. So God is no respector of
[58:02] persons. The only way the first church
[58:03] age can get to heaven, it's the same way
[58:05] the last church age gets to heaven. And
[58:07] that is listening to the word of God.
[58:10] Amen. And then what?
[58:13] Responding. If we come to church and we
[58:17] only hear, but we don't
[58:20] respond, we miss
[58:22] it. We actually, the Bible says, we'll
[58:25] get into it if God gives us time. We
[58:27] deceive ourselves. We deceive ourselves.
[58:31] Amen. Turn with me if you would to 1
[58:34] Corinthians chapter 2. Everyone has ears
[58:36] to
[58:37] hear what they want to understand. But
[58:40] not everyone has ears to hear what God's
[58:43] voice is speaking. Understand the
[58:45] difference. We could all go to a class.
[58:49] We could go we could, you know, Brother
[58:50] Bruce could set up a class and teach us
[58:53] all about cars.
[58:56] A lot about cars. We could teach us a
[58:58] lot about everything, right? And we
[59:01] could we we got the understanding to
[59:03] catch that and understand how threads
[59:06] and bolts and things are fastened and
[59:10] torqu, but when it comes to knowing
[59:14] God, you could spend five years learning
[59:17] the what the Greek means and the Hebrew
[59:19] means and and where it came from and how
[59:23] it ties in.
[59:26] But brother Brandon said, "When that is
[59:28] over, we are actually further away from
[59:31] God than when we started." Amen.
[59:36] God is just looking for a humble heart.
[59:38] Amen. This says, "God, I want to know
[59:40] you sincerely. That's all it takes."
[59:44] 1 Corinthians 2:16 says, "How be it, we
[59:46] speak wisdom among them that are are
[59:48] perfect, yet not the wisdom of this
[59:51] world, nor the princes of this world
[59:53] that come to not, but we speak the
[59:57] wisdom of God." Look, it's in a mystery.
[1:00:00] God's voice is in a mystery. Amen. Even
[1:00:03] the hidden wisdom which God ordained
[1:00:07] before the world unto our glory. In
[1:00:11] other words, from the very beginning,
[1:00:13] God did not want everybody to
[1:00:18] know. Look at this this next verse.
[1:00:20] Which none of the princes of this world
[1:00:22] knew. For if they had known it, they
[1:00:25] would have never crucified the Lord of
[1:00:27] glory. And if if Christ if Christ would
[1:00:29] have never been crucified, then we would
[1:00:31] all be going to hell.
[1:00:34] That's why he had to keep that from the
[1:00:35] devil because the devil would have said,
[1:00:37] "Don't crucify him."
[1:00:40] They would have been doing everything
[1:00:41] they could to keep them from dying.
[1:00:48] But as it is written, I have not seen
[1:00:50] nor ear heard, neither entered into the
[1:00:52] heart of men the things which God have
[1:00:54] prepared for them that love him. But God
[1:00:56] have revealed them unto us by his
[1:00:58] spirit. For the spirit searchth all
[1:01:00] things, yay, the deep things of God. For
[1:01:01] what man knoweth the things of a man,
[1:01:03] save the spirit of a man which is in
[1:01:06] him? Even so, the things of God knoweth
[1:01:09] no man but the spirit of God. Have you
[1:01:11] ever looked at the animal
[1:01:13] world? Like, have you ever just sat
[1:01:16] looked at ants?
[1:01:18] Yes. And just like, what are they doing
[1:01:21] and who are they talking to?
[1:01:26] And deer talking to one another.
[1:01:31] Dogs. All of a sudden, another dog comes
[1:01:33] over to play and all of a sudden they're
[1:01:34] acting so different and
[1:01:38] there's like a language between animals.
[1:01:44] And I've often wondered I I wonder what
[1:01:48] Sophie's thinking right
[1:01:51] now. What is she saying? I mean, there's
[1:01:54] the obvious when she they want she wants
[1:01:56] a treat, right? the obvious because
[1:01:59] you've seen it so many times.
[1:02:02] But just sitting there and going like
[1:02:04] this, she's like, "What are you
[1:02:05] thinking?"
[1:02:09] We cannot figure out God.
[1:02:12] We can't take this Bible and and try to
[1:02:15] decipher who God is. We are depending on
[1:02:19] the spirit of God to tell us who God is.
[1:02:22] Amen. No man knows God except the spirit
[1:02:25] of God. That's why it's important for us
[1:02:28] to seek the Holy Spirit in our heart.
[1:02:32] Not just the knowledge of what God's
[1:02:34] word says. Amen. Now, we have we have
[1:02:37] received not the spirit of the world,
[1:02:38] but the spirit which is of God, that we
[1:02:40] might know the things that are freely
[1:02:42] given to us of God, which things also we
[1:02:44] speak, not in the words of man's wisdom
[1:02:47] teacheth, but which the Holy Ghost
[1:02:50] teacheth. comparing spiritual things
[1:02:52] with spiritual things. Now, I just want
[1:02:53] to say this. This doesn't mean
[1:02:55] necessarily that we need a a a a
[1:02:58] spiritual everything perfectly of the
[1:03:02] Holy Ghost anointing before
[1:03:06] that you're going to hear from God. I've
[1:03:08] been in a Catholic church and I heard
[1:03:09] the voice of God.
[1:03:11] That is the truth. I've been in church.
[1:03:14] I sat in church for years. Nothing,
[1:03:16] nothing happening hardly with anybody,
[1:03:18] but I was in the back weeping, weeping,
[1:03:21] weeping because God was speaking to me.
[1:03:24] It's being in contact with the Holy
[1:03:27] Spirit. Amen. But the natural man
[1:03:29] receiveth not the things of the spirit
[1:03:31] of God, for they are foolishness unto
[1:03:33] him, neither can he know them, because
[1:03:35] they are spiritually discerned. In other
[1:03:37] words, not like intellectually figured
[1:03:39] out. Okay.
[1:03:42] What's politically right or wrong about
[1:03:43] this?
[1:03:46] But spiritually in here, this is what
[1:03:48] God really means. God, what God wants is
[1:03:52] my heart. He doesn't want me to do a
[1:03:54] bunch of works to make it to heaven. I
[1:03:57] spiritually discern that God really
[1:03:59] wants my heart. And the only work I need
[1:04:01] to do is to believe in him. And when he
[1:04:04] tells me to do something, that's what
[1:04:06] the work he wants me to do. Amen.
[1:04:10] Now, as much as God would that he would
[1:04:13] have all men to be saved, we know he
[1:04:17] knows all men would not be saved. Amen.
[1:04:21] So, he actually hides himself from
[1:04:25] them. He's not hiding himself from his
[1:04:28] children.
[1:04:30] He is not hiding himself from his wife.
[1:04:35] He wants to give the Holy Ghost more to
[1:04:38] us than we want it.
[1:04:42] God wants us to hear from him. Amen.
[1:04:50] So, let's not wait on
[1:04:52] God. Let's not say,
[1:04:55] "God, why can't I hear your
[1:04:58] voice? Why aren't I hearing you? Why
[1:05:00] ain't I Why aren't I hearing more from
[1:05:04] you? I think God wants us to get quiet.
[1:05:08] Spend some time alone with him. Yes.
[1:05:13] Get get in a secret place of the most
[1:05:16] high.
[1:05:19] And and let God begin to be real to us.
[1:05:23] We We just We can't get God some fast
[1:05:26] food service. do this, do this, and
[1:05:29] okay, everything's okay. Now I can go on
[1:05:31] my own merry way with my life. That's
[1:05:33] you'll never see God there. You'll never
[1:05:36] know God. You'll never have peace.
[1:05:37] You'll never have joy. You'll never have
[1:05:39] victory
[1:05:39] there. You've got to get real with
[1:05:45] God. He Matthew chap
[1:05:48] 11 verse 25. That time Jesus answered
[1:05:52] and said, "I thank thee, oh father, Lord
[1:05:55] of heaven of earth." Now notice he's
[1:05:59] praying and he's thanking the
[1:06:02] Father, Lord of heaven and of earth
[1:06:06] because you
[1:06:09] hid things from a certain group of
[1:06:13] people who just thought they were wise
[1:06:15] and
[1:06:16] prudent and revealed them unto those who
[1:06:20] didn't feel they were, you know, much of
[1:06:23] anything. a needy. A babe is needed. It
[1:06:27] It needs to feed. It needs It needs
[1:06:32] constant guidance. You cannot leave a
[1:06:34] babe alone and say, "I'll see you here
[1:06:37] in a month from now, next week when I
[1:06:40] get back."
[1:06:45] God wants us in our heart to be needy of
[1:06:50] him. Always needy. How many feel needy
[1:06:53] of the Lord? Amen. That's right.
[1:06:56] When you feel you don't need him, that's
[1:06:59] when he's saying you're lukewarm. You're
[1:07:02] in need of nothing. You're blind. You're
[1:07:03] miserable. And you don't even know it.
[1:07:07] Even so, father, for it seem good in
[1:07:10] your sight to do it this way. Of course,
[1:07:12] we read it there in in Corinthians.
[1:07:15] Jesus
[1:07:17] defines now who has power, right? All
[1:07:21] power, he said, is given unto me in
[1:07:22] heaven and earth. And he says here in
[1:07:24] verse 27, "All things are delivered unto
[1:07:27] me of my father, and no man knoweth the
[1:07:30] son, but the father, neither knoweth any
[1:07:34] man the father, save the son." It's
[1:07:35] almost like, you know, best
[1:07:38] friends. Right? But then he says, "And
[1:07:42] he to whom the son will
[1:07:47] reveal." Like James and Luke are good
[1:07:51] friends.
[1:07:54] are good friends. They have spoken
[1:07:56] things to one another that they have not
[1:07:59] spoken to
[1:08:01] me. I know this to be the
[1:08:05] truth. And if I want to
[1:08:10] know, if I want to
[1:08:13] know, I can't go to Sister Linda and
[1:08:16] say, "Can you tell me what they what
[1:08:18] Luke talked about?"
[1:08:21] because she's not going to
[1:08:23] know. You can't go to brother John to
[1:08:27] find out what God's trying to speak to
[1:08:28] you. Amen.
[1:08:33] You got to go to the source.
[1:08:36] And the source can reveal what was
[1:08:38] spoken.
[1:08:41] Jesus Christ is the revelation of God.
[1:08:44] Amen. And look, he leads into this next
[1:08:46] verse 28. So if you want to you want to
[1:08:50] really know God, he says, "Come unto me
[1:08:54] all ye that are laboring to know God,
[1:08:57] you're heavy laden, you're just
[1:08:58] struggling." And it says, "I will reveal
[1:09:01] myself to you, right? And you'll rest
[1:09:04] right in that face. Final resting place
[1:09:07] is in the word. Take my yoke." That's
[1:09:09] the word of God. Take my word. Learn of
[1:09:12] me for I am meek and lowly in heart. You
[1:09:17] shall find rest for your souls. For my
[1:09:20] yoke is easy and my burden is
[1:09:23] light. Wow. I've talked to I just talked
[1:09:28] to somebody here this
[1:09:30] week and their life had just been
[1:09:35] through the ringer. They just took some
[1:09:37] wrong paths, made some wrong
[1:09:39] choices. And I tell you, they didn't
[1:09:42] take the yoke of
[1:09:45] God. And their life, the burden that
[1:09:49] they carried was so
[1:09:52] heavy that there was no victory in their
[1:09:55] life, nothing to to testify of of a
[1:10:00] lightness and of a of feeling
[1:10:03] good. And so I just say it like this. We
[1:10:07] need to choose the word of God for our
[1:10:09] lives, right? Choose the word of God.
[1:10:12] Don't say don't say in your
[1:10:16] heart, "I'm just going to keep doing
[1:10:19] what I want to do and in my mind and in
[1:10:22] my mouth, I'm going to act like I'm
[1:10:25] taking the word of God." Don't do that.
[1:10:28] Start practicing. No matter what your
[1:10:30] age is, start practicing to take God's
[1:10:33] word. And if the Bible says it, just do
[1:10:36] it.
[1:10:38] Amen.
[1:10:41] The Bible says it just do it. Matthew
[1:10:44] chapter
[1:10:48] 13 and Lord help me to get through all
[1:10:51] that I want to get
[1:10:54] through. Therefore speak I to them in
[1:10:57] parables. Jesus speaking because they
[1:11:00] seen they see not. How can that
[1:11:04] be? And they hear and hear not neither
[1:11:07] do they understand.
[1:11:09] So, they're
[1:11:12] seeing they're seeing this
[1:11:15] wall, this gray
[1:11:18] wall, but God's saying they don't really
[1:11:22] see that it's a gray
[1:11:23] wall. It's It's
[1:11:27] different. They're looking at this
[1:11:30] white, but God's saying it's not
[1:11:34] white. See, they seen. They don't really
[1:11:39] see. They hearing but they really don't
[1:11:42] hear. Neither do they understand. And
[1:11:45] Jesus says, "Why do you not understand
[1:11:47] my speech?" Why? Because you cannot hear
[1:11:50] my word. This word is not important to
[1:11:52] you. As soon as the word becomes
[1:11:54] important to you, I can guarantee you
[1:11:56] have ears to hear. That's all it's got
[1:11:59] to be right there. When the word is
[1:12:01] important to you, you can stand up and
[1:12:03] and and and and testify. I've got ears
[1:12:06] to hear. But the word has to become
[1:12:08] important to you. Right? You can't say,
[1:12:12] I I'm a child of God and I hear, but you
[1:12:14] won't listen to the word.
[1:12:18] And in them, Jesus said, is fulfilled
[1:12:20] the prophecy of Isaiah, which saith, by
[1:12:22] hearing you shall hear and shall not
[1:12:23] understand, and seeing you shall see and
[1:12:26] not perceive. For this people's heart,
[1:12:28] notice it's the heart, not the head. For
[1:12:31] this people's heart is waxed, gross,
[1:12:33] right? And their ears are dull of
[1:12:35] hearing. Right? They got wax in them.
[1:12:38] Like brother John
[1:12:41] and their eyes they have
[1:12:44] closed, lest at any time they should see
[1:12:47] with their eyes and hear with their ears
[1:12:48] and should understand with their heart.
[1:12:49] And what happens after that? Conversion.
[1:12:53] Conversion.
[1:12:55] Satan doesn't want anybody to get
[1:12:58] converted.
[1:13:00] He wants to tell people who are not
[1:13:02] converted that you're
[1:13:04] converted. He wants to tell people who
[1:13:07] don't have the Holy Ghost, they've got
[1:13:08] the Holy Ghost. Amen. Because he doesn't
[1:13:11] want them converted.
[1:13:14] And that's But you know, we can't get
[1:13:16] converted unless we got ears to
[1:13:19] hear. We've got to have ears to hear.
[1:13:23] And then God will heal us. Amen. But
[1:13:25] blessed are your eyes for they see and
[1:13:28] your ears for they hear. For verily I
[1:13:31] say unto you that many prophets and
[1:13:32] righteous men have desired to see those
[1:13:34] things which you see and have not seen
[1:13:35] them and hear those things which you
[1:13:37] hear and have not heard
[1:13:39] them. We are a blessed people. Yes. To
[1:13:42] receive one revelation from God. Amen.
[1:13:46] Just one revelation from God. We're
[1:13:48] blessed.
[1:13:50] Amen.
[1:13:51] and and and to think that we have
[1:13:53] received a a lot of revelations from
[1:13:55] God. We are blessed beyond
[1:13:58] measure. God has blessed us with
[1:14:00] himself. Amen. Hebrews chapter 5
[1:14:04] 11 verbs chapter 5 11 says of whom we
[1:14:09] have many things to say and hard to hard
[1:14:11] to be uttered seeing you are dull of
[1:14:14] hearing. So now the same words being
[1:14:17] used that Jesus used. Dull of
[1:14:22] hearing, not sharp. Like you ever try
[1:14:26] telling somebody
[1:14:27] something and they like don't want to
[1:14:31] listen to what you're saying?
[1:14:36] They
[1:14:38] just I've heard it over. I've heard it.
[1:14:42] You keep saying it. I've heard it.
[1:14:45] They said to brother Ryan, "When are you
[1:14:46] going to get job off the ashet?"
[1:14:54] But we've all tried, those of us that
[1:14:56] have children especially, and maybe
[1:14:58] sometimes those of us that got parents,
[1:15:01] those got it happens to everybody,
[1:15:03] right? Happens to everybody. You try
[1:15:05] telling them something and they just
[1:15:09] don't get it.
[1:15:13] But you know where they're not getting
[1:15:14] it? They're not getting it here. Amen.
[1:15:18] Their attitude don't want it. They hear
[1:15:21] here loud and clear, but here they're
[1:15:25] not getting
[1:15:26] it. And so Paul is saying here there's a
[1:15:31] dullness of
[1:15:33] hearing. You you don't want to hear.
[1:15:35] It's an attitude problem. It's not an an
[1:15:41] understanding. It it's I don't want and
[1:15:45] Paul's calling a doll of hearing for
[1:15:48] when for the time you ought to be
[1:15:51] further along now you ought to be a
[1:15:53] teacher
[1:15:55] and you actually have need that one
[1:15:59] would teach you again which be the very
[1:16:03] first principle of the oracles of God
[1:16:07] and are become as having need of milk
[1:16:10] and not strong meat In other words, oh,
[1:16:12] don't put that pressure on me. Don't
[1:16:14] don't you know, I just can't take this
[1:16:16] high
[1:16:18] standard. You know, you just got to make
[1:16:20] it real easy for me. You know what I
[1:16:22] mean? I mean, just be happy if I can
[1:16:24] make it to church, you know, once a
[1:16:31] month. For everyone that uses milk is
[1:16:36] unskillful in the word of God, for he is
[1:16:38] a babe. Now, if we were going to be here
[1:16:40] today and we're all going to line up
[1:16:41] over here, we're going to put a target
[1:16:43] over there and we're all going to do
[1:16:45] arch, right? Bow and arrow and we're
[1:16:49] going to try to hit the bullseye. We
[1:16:51] would find out who is skilled and who is
[1:16:54] unskilled,
[1:16:56] just with the first
[1:16:58] shot, but we'd give you two.
[1:17:01] Three, you're out. But we would find out
[1:17:05] if we missed the target by this much
[1:17:07] three times in a row, we would consider
[1:17:09] that unskillful,
[1:17:13] someone who doesn't want to obey the
[1:17:15] word of God, right?
[1:17:19] But constantly has to be
[1:17:22] babyed, is unskillful,
[1:17:25] is a babe in Christ.
[1:17:28] And
[1:17:30] we ought to be further along by
[1:17:33] now. Verse 14, but strong meat belongth
[1:17:38] to them that are of full age. You know,
[1:17:41] that doesn't mean 40 years old.
[1:17:44] Full age is not at 18.
[1:17:49] I mean, people could sit in church for
[1:17:51] 50
[1:17:53] years and never be at full age.
[1:17:59] Full age can
[1:18:02] happen shortly after you give your heart
[1:18:04] to God. If you continue on that attitude
[1:18:08] where God, alls I want to do the rest of
[1:18:10] my life is please you.
[1:18:12] That's maturity. Amen. My meat is to do
[1:18:16] the will of him that set me. Strong meat
[1:18:20] belong to them that are full age.
[1:18:22] They've they they've they've taken their
[1:18:24] attitude and they've given it to Jesus
[1:18:26] Christ. Even those who by reason of use
[1:18:29] have their senses exercised to discern
[1:18:32] both good and to and evil. And
[1:18:36] I don't know if we're going to have time
[1:18:37] to get into everything, but look,
[1:18:39] there's one thing that's good. That's
[1:18:41] the word of God. And everything that is
[1:18:43] not the word of God is bad. It's evil.
[1:18:46] You know, we have this this concept of
[1:18:48] thinking that, you know, I understand
[1:18:50] that the word of God is good and I
[1:18:53] understand that the devil and that that
[1:18:56] he's evil and and and murder and and and
[1:19:00] and stealing and and and and just
[1:19:03] robbery and all this uh devil worship
[1:19:07] and and evil worldly music. We know that
[1:19:09] is evil.
[1:19:11] But as long as I'm not doing that,
[1:19:15] I don't have to do that. And in reality,
[1:19:18] anything that's not the word of God, I
[1:19:20] don't care if it's way over there or
[1:19:22] right next to it, it's evil. And that's
[1:19:26] how important it should be for all of us
[1:19:28] to want to make sure that we're staying
[1:19:30] with the word. Amen.
[1:19:32] Amen. Can you say amen? Can you say amen
[1:19:35] again? Amen. All right. All right. James
[1:19:37] chapter 1. James chapter 1.
[1:19:43] James, did you think we were going to
[1:19:45] get through the service without reading
[1:19:47] from your book?
[1:19:50] James chapter 1, starting with verse 18.
[1:19:52] Of his own will begat he us with what?
[1:19:57] The word. We became born again by the
[1:20:00] word that we should
[1:20:03] be a kind of first fruits of his
[1:20:07] creatures, not our own will. Wherefore,
[1:20:12] so there's like the conclusion. My
[1:20:14] beloved brethren, let every man be swift
[1:20:18] to hear, slow to speak, and slow to
[1:20:22] getting upset. That's right.
[1:20:26] Every man. every man and that dead also
[1:20:30] means every
[1:20:32] woman. That word swift means
[1:20:35] prompt. Be ready. Be sober. Be vigilant.
[1:20:40] Wake up. Amen.
[1:20:43] Every man, let him be prompt when the
[1:20:45] word of God is being preached. Amen.
[1:20:48] Amen. Let it be in my life, Lord. Not
[1:20:51] well, you know, it was a good service.
[1:20:55] be swift to
[1:20:57] hear. You know, a lot of times we're
[1:20:59] swift to be we're swift to
[1:21:04] just be quiet and do
[1:21:08] nothing. Swift to not listen. Swift to
[1:21:12] just whatever. I'm just zoning you out.
[1:21:15] Uh I'm just zoning you out. I'm in my
[1:21:18] own world. Yes, sir.
[1:21:22] We need to be slow to
[1:21:24] speak about what's being spoken to us.
[1:21:27] Just say amen.
[1:21:29] Anything more of that is is probably
[1:21:31] going to be bad stuff.
[1:21:34] Slow to speak, slow to wrath. That that
[1:21:37] means do not murmur. Do not complain
[1:21:40] about what's being preached. Do not
[1:21:42] murmur and complain about what you read
[1:21:44] in the Bible or what brother Brandham
[1:21:46] says on the tapes. Do not
[1:21:49] just slow to speak, slow to
[1:21:55] wrath. Now,
[1:21:57] here's God speaking to
[1:22:01] Cain. Just a regular conversation,
[1:22:04] church. Look, Cain, look, if you do
[1:22:07] good, everything's going to be okay in
[1:22:10] your life.
[1:22:12] But if you choose not and you want to do
[1:22:15] your own thing, then trouble lies at
[1:22:18] your
[1:22:19] door. But you know, God came to church
[1:22:22] that day and he could
[1:22:24] tell that something was
[1:22:26] wrong with Cain by his countenance.
[1:22:31] Just his
[1:22:33] countenance. His
[1:22:35] countenance was
[1:22:39] not He was not happy.
[1:22:43] He was not happy because he was not
[1:22:47] getting what he wanted. He was not being
[1:22:49] accepted with his
[1:22:51] will. Everybody wants to be
[1:22:54] accepted, but we need to be want to be
[1:22:56] accepted with doing the will of God.
[1:22:58] Amen.
[1:23:04] And what happened is when he was not
[1:23:08] accepted, then he was he got angry real
[1:23:13] quick. He got wroth. The Bible says and
[1:23:17] the Bible is telling us here to be slow
[1:23:19] to speak, slow to wrath. For the wrath
[1:23:23] of a man workketh not the righteousness
[1:23:25] of God. How many you ever been upset?
[1:23:28] Really? I'm talking about the wrath of
[1:23:31] man. You've been upset, but you you you
[1:23:36] in the flesh, but you you you were you
[1:23:40] you did the will of God.
[1:23:43] Never. No. It just doesn't work the
[1:23:46] righteousness of
[1:23:50] God.
[1:23:52] Now, not going to get into righteous
[1:23:54] indignation, but you you you certainly
[1:23:56] don't let the flesh there, right? Verse
[1:23:59] 21. Wherefore lay apart all filthiness
[1:24:02] of superfluity of naughtiness. In other
[1:24:05] words, all you excuses for not doing
[1:24:09] what you should be doing, lay it aside.
[1:24:13] Just lay it. It's naughtiness. Lay it
[1:24:15] aside and receive with meekness the
[1:24:18] engrafted word which is able to save
[1:24:20] your souls.
[1:24:22] But be ye doers of the word and not
[1:24:26] hearers only, deceiving yourself.
[1:24:31] You know, most people are quite
[1:24:32] satisfied when they hear from God.
[1:24:37] In other words, because they're not used
[1:24:39] to hearing from God. When they finally
[1:24:42] hear something from God, they're excited
[1:24:44] about it. I heard from God. God spoke to
[1:24:47] me.
[1:24:49] But they don't
[1:24:51] respond. They don't respond to what God
[1:24:54] spoke to them. They're just happy that
[1:24:58] God spoke to them. But we've got to
[1:25:01] respond because God does not speak to us
[1:25:04] and not want us to
[1:25:06] respond. When God speaks, he wants us to
[1:25:10] respond. Amen. There's something God
[1:25:12] wants us to do. God is a productive man.
[1:25:20] God wants us to grow up.
[1:25:24] How many has a child? Let me see your
[1:25:27] hands. Okay. Have you ever had this
[1:25:29] thought? I never want my child to grow
[1:25:35] up. All I got to do is be bad for just a
[1:25:38] few minutes. And the first thing you're
[1:25:40] thinking is, I wish they would grow up.
[1:25:45] Well, I'm telling you, when we become
[1:25:47] when we begin the new birth, when the
[1:25:51] process begins with repentance and
[1:25:55] justification, God still wants us to
[1:25:57] grow up. He doesn't want us to stay in
[1:26:00] that that stage. He wants us to he wants
[1:26:04] us to to become sanctified.
[1:26:08] He wants us to get filled with his
[1:26:09] spirit. He wants us to operate a a as a
[1:26:14] mature son and daughter of God. He wants
[1:26:17] us to be a doer of the word and not a
[1:26:20] hearer only. And when we become
[1:26:23] satisfied with just coming to church and
[1:26:25] hearing the word but not doing it, you
[1:26:27] know what we're doing? We're taking
[1:26:29] deceiving pills.
[1:26:32] We're taking deceiving
[1:26:34] pills. You ever take a painkiller
[1:26:39] and you're just
[1:26:41] like, I'm going to sleep. You ever take
[1:26:44] a benadryil? Yes.
[1:26:47] You've taken stuff and your mind just
[1:26:49] goes a little bit right.
[1:26:55] Sure. In the world, we drank, we smoked
[1:26:57] marijuana, we took drugs. When we did
[1:27:00] that, our mind became
[1:27:02] altered. Are you with me? Amen.
[1:27:06] Well, what happens when you come to
[1:27:07] church and you hear the word of God, but
[1:27:09] you do not do anything but that? You're
[1:27:12] taking a deceiving pill.
[1:27:15] You might as well walk out with more
[1:27:17] deception than when you came in because
[1:27:18] brother Brandham says you never come
[1:27:20] into church the same way you leave.
[1:27:22] Amen.
[1:27:24] You may not think about it. You may want
[1:27:25] not want to deal with it, but you're
[1:27:28] either getting closer to God or further
[1:27:30] away.
[1:27:35] Amen.
[1:27:37] Thinking about this thought process here
[1:27:39] when God's speaking to you, if I can
[1:27:41] just leave here just for a second, go to
[1:27:43] Philippians 2:12. Wherefore, my beloved
[1:27:47] brethren, as you have not always obeyed,
[1:27:51] as you've always obeyed, not in my
[1:27:53] presence only, but much more in my
[1:27:54] absence. Work out your own salvation
[1:27:56] with fear and trembling. What a
[1:27:58] compliment that would
[1:28:00] be to obey God's word when nobody's
[1:28:03] looking.
[1:28:05] You know what? You know, when you do
[1:28:07] that, you know what you're doing? You're
[1:28:08] working out your salvation with fear and
[1:28:11] trembling. But if you're not doing
[1:28:14] that, then you need more fear and
[1:28:16] trembling. Amen. For it is God which
[1:28:20] workketh in you. Yes. Both to will and
[1:28:23] to do of his good pleasure. Amen. So, we
[1:28:26] come to church and God speaks to your
[1:28:28] heart. Not your head, but your heart.
[1:28:30] Yes. And he's trying to get in there.
[1:28:32] You got to open your heart. Say, "Yes,
[1:28:34] Lord. I'm going to do that, right? I'm
[1:28:36] going to obey you. I'm going to leave
[1:28:37] here. I'm going to really put you first
[1:28:40] in my
[1:28:44] life. Do this." Verse
[1:28:48] 14, do what God tells you to do. Do all
[1:28:51] things without murmurings and disput.
[1:28:54] Try going one day without murmuring and
[1:28:55] complaining.
[1:28:58] And you better hope it's a sunshiny day
[1:29:00] cuz nobody likes the misery of it always
[1:29:03] raining and storming and cold and but
[1:29:07] just go one day without murmur and
[1:29:09] complaining without just dis justputing.
[1:29:11] means like come to church and just be
[1:29:14] excited to hear from God that you may be
[1:29:18] blameless and harmless the sons of God
[1:29:22] without rebuke in the midst of a crooked
[1:29:25] and perverse nation among whom you shine
[1:29:28] as lights in the world. That's right.
[1:29:30] Takes a lot to be different, doesn't it?
[1:29:33] It takes a lot to be different in this
[1:29:35] world. All right. Going back to James
[1:29:38] now 1:22. But be ye doers of the word
[1:29:40] and not hearers only, deceiving your own
[1:29:43] self. For if any man be a hearer of the
[1:29:45] word and not a doer, he is like a man
[1:29:47] beholding his natural face in a glass.
[1:29:50] For he beholdeth himself and goeth his
[1:29:52] way and straightway forggetth what
[1:29:55] manner of man he
[1:29:58] was. Now I remember when
[1:30:02] I had got married, I don't know if I had
[1:30:04] ever shared this. if I did, if you hear
[1:30:07] the story, please forgive me. But I
[1:30:09] remember when I got
[1:30:11] married that I I really had um like a
[1:30:16] big uh boo boo on my
[1:30:19] nose and um I don't know if I tried
[1:30:23] getting rid of it. Were you there,
[1:30:25] Brother Bruce? You would maybe remember
[1:30:27] it was pretty big.
[1:30:33] I'll never ever ever forget this.
[1:30:38] And so maybe I was like didn't know how
[1:30:40] to take care of them or whatever and I'm
[1:30:41] trying to get rid of it and all as I did
[1:30:44] was make it worse. You ever do that? Try
[1:30:46] to get rid of one and all of a sudden
[1:30:48] it's like five times redder and and it
[1:30:50] looks more terrible and you have this
[1:30:52] thought. I wish I wouldn't have touched
[1:30:55] it. Well, that's where I was. But you
[1:30:58] know what? I left the mirror and I
[1:31:00] forgot about it.
[1:31:03] And I completely forgot it because it's
[1:31:05] my wedding day.
[1:31:07] And I'm standing in front of Brother
[1:31:10] Johnson who's marrying us. And brother
[1:31:14] Johnson looks at
[1:31:15] me. He says, "Can't you do something
[1:31:17] with
[1:31:18] that?" And I literally forgot about it
[1:31:21] because I left the
[1:31:23] mirror. And sometimes we come to church,
[1:31:26] we hear the word of God being preached,
[1:31:28] we realize we're not what we ought to be
[1:31:31] and we just forget about it when we
[1:31:32] leave.
[1:31:38] God wants us to remember what he speaks
[1:31:41] to us.
[1:31:43] Can you imagine going to God's house,
[1:31:44] having a conversation with him, and then
[1:31:47] forgetting everything he just
[1:31:49] said? No.
[1:31:51] I mean, if we had a we had a chance to
[1:31:53] sit down with a president or vice
[1:31:55] president or whatever, somebody that we
[1:32:00] look up
[1:32:01] to, we would like pay attention and want
[1:32:04] to
[1:32:06] hear, but sometimes I think we just
[1:32:08] forget that God is the one speaking at
[1:32:12] church and it's not just a man, but
[1:32:14] really God is speaking to us. Amen.
[1:32:17] Amen.
[1:32:19] But who so lookth into the word of God
[1:32:22] and continuth
[1:32:24] therein, he being not a forgetful
[1:32:27] hearer, but a doer of noticed the work
[1:32:32] because it takes
[1:32:35] work. When you respond to the word, it
[1:32:37] takes
[1:32:39] work. This man, this man shall be
[1:32:43] blessed in his deed.
[1:32:45] Not everybody's going to be blessed, but
[1:32:47] the man that continues in doing, he's
[1:32:50] the one whose life is going to be
[1:32:51] blessed. For if any man among you seem
[1:32:54] to be religious and he doesn't control
[1:32:56] what comes out of his mouth, that's
[1:32:58] right. He's He deceiveth his own heart.
[1:33:02] His own heart. Not his head, his own
[1:33:04] heart. This man's religion is vain.
[1:33:08] Amen. The word of God is God. Amen.
[1:33:12] Whatever is not the word of
[1:33:16] God is the
[1:33:20] devil. That's that's a strong one, but
[1:33:22] it's the
[1:33:24] truth. We've heard if you How many's met
[1:33:28] the devil today somewhere today? One,
[1:33:31] two, three, four, five. You met the
[1:33:36] devil? Yeah. Yeah, I heard brother
[1:33:38] Hanken say if you haven't met the devil
[1:33:41] somewhere along the course of your day,
[1:33:43] you need to take another look because
[1:33:45] maybe you're walking in continuity with
[1:33:47] him
[1:33:49] because he's there to battle us. He's
[1:33:52] there guarding the stairway to heaven as
[1:33:55] it were to keep us from moving on with
[1:33:57] Christ to try to get us off. So, we must
[1:34:00] overcome the
[1:34:02] devil with faith in the word of God.
[1:34:07] Now, we're not going to overcome the
[1:34:09] devil if we don't recognize him.
[1:34:12] So, it's important to recognize the
[1:34:14] devil in our heads. Amen. Brother
[1:34:16] Brandon said in the message, "How can I
[1:34:17] overcome?" He said, "Overcome means to
[1:34:19] recognize the devil in every one of his
[1:34:23] tricks." He said, "Lot of people say
[1:34:27] there's no
[1:34:28] devil. It's just a thought in my head."
[1:34:34] He says, "Don't you believe that?"
[1:34:36] Right? There's a real devil. Amen. He's
[1:34:40] just as real as you are or anybody.
[1:34:44] Yes. So, in other words, the thought
[1:34:46] that comes into your head is either
[1:34:49] coming from God or it's coming from the
[1:34:52] devil.
[1:34:54] There's a reason the Bible says, "Think
[1:34:56] on these things." Yes, there's wrong
[1:34:59] things to think about and they'll bring
[1:35:01] you down. Right.
[1:35:04] Keep your mind stayed on the Lord. It'll
[1:35:06] keep you up. Amen.
[1:35:09] So even though it's a thought in our
[1:35:11] head, it's still either of God or of the
[1:35:13] devil. And we need to recognize more the
[1:35:16] devil, right, in our
[1:35:19] minds. Because look, it the devil
[1:35:22] speaking to brother Ben doesn't bother
[1:35:24] me.
[1:35:29] Now, if Brother
[1:35:32] Ben starts doing what that thought
[1:35:36] says, and that thought
[1:35:38] is a real bad thought, that could
[1:35:41] negatively affect me. But the thoughts
[1:35:44] that come in to Brother Ben's head do
[1:35:47] not affect me. Do not do not do not
[1:35:50] bother me. Do not make me a a a worse
[1:35:54] Christian. doesn't make me go sin or
[1:35:56] quit on
[1:35:58] God. But the thoughts that come into my
[1:36:00] head,
[1:36:03] those are the ones I got to watch.
[1:36:06] Those are the ones we have to watch. So,
[1:36:08] Brother Ram says it's a real devil and
[1:36:09] you must recognize him real. Recognize
[1:36:12] him real. You must know he's a devil.
[1:36:15] Then the same time that you recognize
[1:36:18] him and know that he's a devil and that
[1:36:20] he's against you, then you can overcome.
[1:36:22] See, you must recognize that God in
[1:36:27] you is greater and mightier than he is.
[1:36:33] That the one that's in you has already
[1:36:37] overcome them. Amen.
[1:36:39] And by his grace, you are more than a
[1:36:42] match for him. Amen. There's a real
[1:36:44] overcoming when you recognize. That's
[1:36:47] right. So when we hear the word of God
[1:36:50] and it doesn't become important to us to
[1:36:53] follow it, we must we must recognize
[1:36:55] that is the devil speaking to us.
[1:36:58] God's
[1:36:59] voice is his
[1:37:01] word. I mean we want to hear from God,
[1:37:05] right? It's the Bible. The Bible is the
[1:37:08] word of God. Amen. And if we learn
[1:37:12] uh if we learn to be faithful with the
[1:37:17] word of God, we'll know we'll be
[1:37:20] faithful when we hear his
[1:37:23] voice. So we had just um when we hire
[1:37:29] somebody or somebody comes and works for
[1:37:32] us, what we're what we look for is we
[1:37:35] look to see if they can follow
[1:37:36] instructions.
[1:37:40] And a lot of times um I will not
[1:37:43] instruct them what to
[1:37:45] do. I will give somebody else to
[1:37:50] instruct
[1:37:52] them. And if they're faithful
[1:37:56] following the instructions of the
[1:38:00] shop, that means more than likely they
[1:38:03] would be faithful with what I would tell
[1:38:05] them.
[1:38:06] But if if they had to hear from me
[1:38:09] direct but could not hear from me
[1:38:11] through somebody else,
[1:38:14] that means they're truly not following
[1:38:16] me.
[1:38:19] And so the point that I'm trying to say
[1:38:20] here is the word of God is the voice of
[1:38:23] God. And we need to be content with
[1:38:25] reading that Bible and being assured
[1:38:28] that this is God and not feeling like I
[1:38:31] got to hear something personally, right?
[1:38:34] Because the word of God should be
[1:38:35] personal to us, right? I mean, it's all
[1:38:39] beautiful and wonderful when we hear
[1:38:40] something personal for our lives, but
[1:38:43] God also wants He'll probably do that a
[1:38:46] lot more. We'll probably hear from God a
[1:38:47] lot more if the whole word becomes
[1:38:49] important to us. All right. John chapter
[1:38:52] 10:3. Oh my my. Let's Let's just We
[1:38:56] can't We can't go on. It's it's after
[1:38:57] nine. So, let's just stand together and
[1:38:59] and I'm not going to hold you. I'm not
[1:39:01] going to hold you. And I and I so hard
[1:39:03] to believe that um so much time has gone
[1:39:08] away today. It was so so quick. But
[1:39:11] praise the Lord that we we praise the
[1:39:14] Lord that we can quit
[1:39:17] now. Thank you for your
[1:39:20] patience. How many How many want to
[1:39:24] follow the voice of God?
[1:39:26] Amen. And Jesus said, "My sheep hear my
[1:39:30] voice and they follow me." Right? So
[1:39:34] where are the sheep hearing the voice?
[1:39:36] In the heart. Amen. In the heart. All
[1:39:39] right. Let's just go to the Lord in
[1:39:42] prayer together. Our heavenly father, we
[1:39:44] as your sheep,
[1:39:46] we we stand before
[1:39:49] you so
[1:39:51] grateful that you have kept us by your
[1:39:55] power.
[1:39:57] The scripture says that we are kept by
[1:39:59] the power of God unto salvation. We
[1:40:03] thank you for keeping us. We thank you
[1:40:05] for the keeping
[1:40:06] power. Lord, we thank you for
[1:40:11] speaking to every one of our hearts and
[1:40:14] placing within us the ability to hear
[1:40:16] your voice. Amen. We're eternally
[1:40:19] grateful to you for that. We cannot
[1:40:21] thank you
[1:40:23] enough. Through that communication,
[1:40:26] we're able to express to you a a a heart
[1:40:30] of of love and and uh worship and and
[1:40:36] repentance and obedience
[1:40:39] and all because Lord, you've given us a
[1:40:42] a receiver to to hear and understand in
[1:40:46] our hearts. And I pray that you would
[1:40:48] bless every one of us here as we leave
[1:40:50] here
[1:40:53] today.
[1:40:55] Determine to be listening more in our
[1:40:57] heart for your
[1:40:59] voice and to keep ourselves settled in
[1:41:03] our minds
[1:41:05] until Lord we can
[1:41:08] be led in our heart. Please bless each
[1:41:12] one of us with a closer
[1:41:15] walk, Lord. As we respond, I pray that
[1:41:18] you'd bless us as we draw nigh to you. I
[1:41:22] pray that you'd draw nigh to us. Give us
[1:41:24] strength to draw closer to you. Give us
[1:41:27] strength to respond to your word. Give
[1:41:30] us strength to follow you. For you said,
[1:41:33] "My
[1:41:35] sheep know my voice and they follow.
[1:41:38] They respond. God, help us to
[1:41:42] respond, to be a doer of what you're
[1:41:45] speaking to us. Lord, help us to leave
[1:41:48] here and come into church, come in and
[1:41:51] out, Lord, with a with a determination
[1:41:55] to follow after you. We thank you for
[1:41:58] these things. Thank you, Lord,
[1:42:00] for for all that you have done for us in
[1:42:03] our life. And thank you for seeing us
[1:42:05] through, Lord. We thank you for this
[1:42:06] word tonight. We worship you.
