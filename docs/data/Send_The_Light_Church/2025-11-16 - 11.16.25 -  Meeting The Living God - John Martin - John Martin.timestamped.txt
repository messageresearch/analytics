[8:08] I have decided [music] to follow Jesus.
[8:14] No turning [singing] back.
[8:16] No turning back. Amen.
[8:22] &gt;&gt; Amen. You know, well, I just like to
[8:26] just do something a little bit different
[8:27] than I think we've ever done here
[8:29] before. And I just
[8:31] came across this as I was preparing
[8:35] songs
[8:37] uh during the week. Anyway, I want to
[8:40] tell you the story behind that song we
[8:42] just sang.
[8:43] I don't know anybody's heard it, but
[8:46] it's definitely a testimony.
[8:50] Well,
[8:52] I don't know how many there's a few
[8:54] older ones here, but there used to be
[8:56] this uh
[8:58] who how many has heard about the Welsh
[9:00] Revival,
[9:02] right? Well, it's a big revival that
[9:05] happened, right?
[9:07] And it was so big that when somebody
[9:10] came over to find out what was going on,
[9:13] everybody was gone and they were all
[9:16] just all worshiping God. There was no
[9:20] there wasn't anybody in the jails. I
[9:21] mean, everybody was just a revival
[9:26] can just bring forth God and somebody's
[9:29] life. Amen. To a fuller extent. Amen.
[9:32] Well, anyway, this song comes from
[9:35] somebody that went to that revival and
[9:37] they went to India
[9:39] after the Welsh revival and the person
[9:42] came to uh north uh East India which was
[9:47] a really violent kind of like uh you
[9:50] could just imagine the different
[9:51] religions and things like that that
[9:53] comes forth from there, right?
[9:55] And um so the man preached the gospel of
[9:58] Christ to the whole village that was
[10:01] there. And um this [clears throat] man
[10:06] his his wife and his two children
[10:08] accepted Christ, right?
[10:12] So the chief of the tribe back then got
[10:17] really mad. He says, you know, you you
[10:20] can't do this, right? And you can just
[10:23] put this in however in your own mind,
[10:26] but so he got mad and he says, "You got
[10:29] to renounce Christ." And he says, "No,
[10:32] I'm not going to do that." He says,
[10:34] "No." He said, "No, I won't do that."
[10:37] And uh so the um
[10:41] um let me just read this here.
[10:45] And um
[10:47] so the chief said, "Okay, well then
[10:50] bring your family up." So his his wife,
[10:53] his two kids and himself stood in front
[10:55] of the village and this told him again
[10:59] he says you have to renounce Christ. And
[11:00] and the father said no I'm not going to
[11:02] do that. He says I've decided to follow
[11:06] Jesus
[11:11] and there's no turning back.
[11:16] So the chief had some of the his
[11:22] followers, I guess, shot to his two
[11:24] kids.
[11:27] And
[11:29] so he he came to the father again and he
[11:32] says, you know, you got to denounce
[11:35] Christ.
[11:37] And he says he says he told him again,
[11:40] he says, no. So he he shot the he shot
[11:44] the two or he shot his wife
[11:48] and
[11:50] uh you know they just laid there lay
[11:53] there dying and uh he says no he says uh
[11:58] no there's no turning back you know none
[12:01] go with me still I'll follow.
[12:04] So the chief said well he says you know
[12:07] if you don't denounce Christ we're going
[12:08] to kill you.
[12:10] And he says, "Well, if
[12:13] that's what it takes, kill me."
[12:17] And
[12:19] so anyway,
[12:21] he uh the chief killed him, right? So we
[12:25] think of this as a sad story, right? And
[12:28] in some ways it probably is. But the
[12:31] testimony of the of the story is that
[12:34] because he he stood up for Christ,
[12:39] the whole village accepted Christ.
[12:46] &gt;&gt; So
[12:48] it's not what
[12:51] we can be a testimony. Amen.
[12:56] &gt;&gt; So anyway, let's just I pray that gives
[13:00] you more meaning to the song.
[13:05] &gt;&gt; So we know that following Jesus isn't
[13:09] what everybody thinks it is. It's
[13:12] deeper.
[13:14] So let's just sing that again. Amen.
[13:19] I have decided
[13:23] [music] to follow Jesus.
[13:26] I have decided [singing]
[13:29] to follow Jesus. [music]
[13:32] I have decided
[13:34] [singing] to follow Jesus. [music]
[13:38] No turning back.
[13:41] No turning [singing] back.
[13:44] The cross before me. The world behind
[13:48] me. The cross before [music and singing]
[13:51] me. The world behind me. The cross
[13:56] before [music and singing] me. The world
[13:59] behind me. [music]
[14:01] I won't turn back.
[14:04] I won't turn back.
[14:07] Take this whole [music and singing]
[14:09] world, but give me Jesus.
[14:13] Take this [singing] whole world, but
[14:16] give me Jesus. [music]
[14:19] Take this whole world, [singing]
[14:21] but [music] give me Jesus.
[14:24] I won't [singing] turn back.
[14:27] I won't turn back. No, none go with me.
[14:30] Though none go with me, still I will
[14:34] follow. [singing]
[14:35] [music]
[14:36] Though none go with me, still I will
[14:40] follow.
[14:41] Though [music] none go with me, still I
[14:45] will follow.
[14:47] No turning [music and singing] back.
[14:50] No turning back. Amen. Hallelujah.
[14:55] Amen. I pray you have that revelation
[14:57] this morning.
[14:59] &gt;&gt; Because
[15:00] it's a personal walk with Christ. Amen.
[15:04] Fill my cup, Lord. Fill my No, I fill my
[15:08] fill my way with love. I'm sorry. Amen.
[15:12] Let me walk blessed Lord in the way
[15:16] [music and singing]
[15:17] thou has gone. Leading straight to the
[15:20] land above. [singing]
[15:24] Giving cheer everywhere to the sad and
[15:29] alone. Fill my way [singing] every day
[15:33] with love.
[15:36] Fill my way [singing]
[15:37] every day with love.
[15:42] As I walk with that heavenly dove,
[15:47] [singing and music]
[15:47] let me go all the while with a song
[15:51] [singing] and a smile. Fill my way every
[15:55] day [singing] with love.
[15:59] Keep [music] me close to the side of my
[16:03] savior and guide. Let me never [singing]
[16:07] in darkness ro.
[16:10] Keep my path free from wrath and my soul
[16:15] satisfied. [music] Fill my way every day
[16:19] [singing] with love.
[16:22] Fill my way [singing] every day with
[16:25] [music] love.
[16:28] As I [singing] walk with that heavenly
[16:31] [music] dog,
[16:34] let me go all the while with a song
[16:38] [music and singing] and a smile. Fill my
[16:40] way every day with love.
[16:45] Soon the [music and singing] race will
[16:47] be over and I'll travel no more, but
[16:51] abide in my home above.
[16:54] [music and singing]
[16:55] Hallelujah. Oh, let me sing. Bless the
[16:59] King all the way to the shore. Fill my
[17:03] [music] way [singing]
[17:04] every day with love.
[17:08] Fill my [music] way every day with love.
[17:14] As I walk with that heavenly [music]
[17:17] dove.
[17:20] Let me go all the while with a song
[17:24] [music and singing] and a smile. Fill my
[17:26] way every day with [singing] love.
[17:31] Hallelujah.
[17:33] &gt;&gt; Grant it, Lord. You know,
[17:36] I don't think that man had very much
[17:38] time when he gave his heart to Christ.
[17:42] &gt;&gt; But I do believe God filled his heart
[17:46] with love.
[17:49] And you know sometimes we sing these
[17:52] songs but we don't really think of the
[17:54] meaning of the songs.
[17:57] &gt;&gt; And
[17:58] in each song I truly believe that
[18:01] there's a testimony.
[18:04] &gt;&gt; So
[18:06] let our life be a testimony.
[18:10] &gt;&gt; Amen. Well, there's some needs that we
[18:12] need to bring before the church. Amen.
[18:15] Let's uh our sister Cheryl has a a
[18:18] request. Um well, it's from Sister Anne,

[18:27] my grandpa healing as well as strength
[18:30] in his body. My sister Cheryl's family

[25:02] of weery [singing]
[25:04] ways or golden days before [music] his

[31:32] like thee.
[31:35] [music]
[31:37] Amen.
[31:39] &gt;&gt; What a precious desire.
[31:41] &gt;&gt; Amen. I believe that God is here. He
[31:44] promised
[31:46] to fill the hungry
[31:48] &gt;&gt; to to quench those that are thirsting
[31:51] after righteousness.
[31:53] And yet he's hid from those that don't
[31:57] trust him.
[31:58] &gt;&gt; And we serve a a a mighty God today.
[32:02] Well, God bless you. It's good to be in
[32:04] the house of the Lord and good to be
[32:06] with my family.
[32:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[32:08] &gt;&gt; And uh brother uh Gideon sends his
[32:10] greetings this morning. So we want to
[32:12] greet him back. Amen. It's good to see
[32:15] Sit Trina.
[32:16] &gt;&gt; It's been uh too long.
[32:20] And uh and the boys, it's been too long.
[32:22] It's good to see them front and center.
[32:25] Amen.
[32:26] &gt;&gt; Praise God. How many love Jesus today?
[32:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[32:30] &gt;&gt; Amen. Um let's look to the Lord in
[32:34] prayer and then we'll open the
[32:35] scriptures.
[32:37] Father, we thank you that we've had this
[32:40] this time to worship you, to praise you,
[32:43] to express our love to you in song and
[32:46] course.
[32:48] Lord, we thank you for these
[32:51] these men that have given their life to
[32:54] stand for you.
[32:56] &gt;&gt; And Lord, we don't know, but there are
[32:59] countless of those that have given their
[33:02] life standing for the truth.
[33:05] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[33:07] And Lord, what a privileged people we
[33:09] are today to be able to be in a a
[33:13] country
[33:15] in a in a church where there's freedom
[33:17] and liberty to believe your word.
[33:20] &gt;&gt; To stand for the truth, to to worship
[33:23] you in spirit and truth. Father, as
[33:26] we've gathered together this morning,
[33:28] Lord, we've there's a a yearning inside
[33:33] of us to to know you in a deeper way,
[33:40] to have communion with you.
[33:44] um so close that we would leave here
[33:48] changed,
[33:50] that it would be uh no longer us trying
[33:55] to live a better life, but it would be
[33:58] you inside of us living that life.
[34:02] &gt;&gt; That's how much we desire you this
[34:03] morning, Lord. Will you come in the
[34:06] realness of that in of that and uh
[34:11] unveil yourself to every one of us? May
[34:13] you get personal with every one of us.
[34:16] &gt;&gt; May we open our hearts to you and give
[34:19] you our will, give you our promise to
[34:23] keep your commandments, Lord. Lord,
[34:26] &gt;&gt; Father, we commit this service into your
[34:28] hands and ask you to bless the reading
[34:31] of your word to all of our hearts. May
[34:33] it be accompanied with revelation now as
[34:36] we wait further upon thee. We pray these
[34:38] things and give you the glory for them
[34:40] all in Jesus Christ's name. Amen.
[34:44] &gt;&gt; Amen. Turn with me if you would to
[34:46] Psalms chapter 46.
[34:50] And after you turn there, then you can
[34:52] go to Isaiah 61.
[35:03] [snorts]
[35:04] Well, we may not all feel like praising
[35:08] the Lord. We may not all feel
[35:11] uh
[35:13] cozy and beautiful, but I'll say this.
[35:16] If we can just focus on what God has
[35:19] done for us.
[35:21] &gt;&gt; Uh because there's no one here that can
[35:24] testify that God has not been good to
[35:26] them.
[35:28] &gt;&gt; And he's he's worthy of our praise.
[35:32] &gt;&gt; So let's worship him as we receive the
[35:34] word now. Psalms 46:7, the Lord of hosts
[35:37] is with us. The God of Jacob is our
[35:40] refuge.
[35:42] Come, behold the works of the Lord. What
[35:46] desolations he have made in the earth.
[35:48] He maketh wars to cease unto the end of
[35:51] the earth. He breakth the bow and cutth
[35:54] the spear under. He burneth the chariots
[35:56] the in the fire. Be still
[36:01] and know that I am God.
[36:05] And I will be exalted among the heathen.
[36:06] I will be exalted in the earth. The Lord
[36:08] of hosts is with us. The God of Jacob is
[36:12] our refuge. Sheila. Amen. Turn with me
[36:15] now if you would to the book of Isaiah
[36:17] chapter 61. We want to entitle this
[36:19] message the living God. And for our
[36:22] subject, Stand still and know God.
[36:28] Isaiah chapter 61.
[36:31] We're just going to read one verse there
[36:32] and that's verse number three. God is
[36:35] here this morning to appoint unto us
[36:38] that mourn in Zion to give unto us the
[36:42] beauty of ashes, the oil of joy from
[36:45] mourning, the garment of praise for the
[36:47] spirit of heaviness,
[36:49] that we might be called trees of
[36:52] righteousness,
[36:54] &gt;&gt; the planting of the Lord, that God might
[36:58] be glorified.
[37:00] Amen. God bless you. You may be seated.
[37:14] When I think about
[37:16] God
[37:18] um and and how people view God because
[37:22] he's invisible, it makes it so easy for
[37:25] the enemy
[37:27] to to say there's no God. As we know,
[37:30] one of Jesus's disciples, God bless you,
[37:33] brother Marty. So good to see you. Amen.
[37:36] Um,
[37:38] Thomas, one of his own disciples,
[37:41] doubted
[37:44] the the resurrection
[37:46] of Jesus Christ.
[37:49] And he said, "I won't I won't believe
[37:51] until I see." And I more than see, I got
[37:54] to take my fingers and I got to stick it
[37:56] in in in his side where the spear went
[37:59] because I saw it happen.
[38:03] But if we could just ponder this
[38:05] thought, how many has the ability to do
[38:07] something
[38:09] to to to make an outfit to to make
[38:12] cookies?
[38:14] We got abilities to craft woodwork to do
[38:18] drywall to do all sorts of things to
[38:21] take the copper out of out of some
[38:26] uh mold or something like that. We but
[38:29] none of us has the ability to create
[38:32] life.
[38:35] &gt;&gt; So I just step back for a second. I
[38:37] think who created me?
[38:41] Who created human beings?
[38:44] Who created life?
[38:48] There are so many amazing facts about
[38:51] the human body.
[38:54] There are about 80 organs in our body.
[38:59] And these organs all have a different
[39:02] purpose.
[39:04] They function differently to accomplish
[39:07] something. You take a couple of those
[39:10] organs out and you're not alive anymore.
[39:14] &gt;&gt; It has to be replaced with another
[39:16] organ. And in that there's just a chance
[39:19] whether it's going to take or not.
[39:22] And each one of these organs have a
[39:24] particular purpose that they must
[39:27] fulfill in order for you to breathe
[39:30] today.
[39:35] &gt;&gt; And these organs are supplied by blood.
[39:40] And there's a vessel that goes to each
[39:42] one of these and through them and around
[39:45] your body. There are so many vessels in
[39:47] our body that literally if you put them
[39:50] all together, you could go around the
[39:52] earth four times in each human body.
[39:59] And inside those vessels are about 35
[40:04] trillion cells with a purpose.
[40:09] And just from a scientific standpoint,
[40:12] there is like no doubt in my mind that
[40:14] there's a God
[40:17] &gt;&gt; because there ain't a human being that
[40:18] can create that
[40:22] &gt;&gt; and that just goes on and on with the
[40:24] animals.
[40:26] So, it's easy for me to believe that God
[40:29] is here this morning. And his word
[40:31] declares that if just two or three are
[40:33] gathered together in his name, I'll be
[40:35] there in the midst.
[40:37] &gt;&gt; He does not have to be seen for me to
[40:40] believe.
[40:45] &gt;&gt; So, we're going to talk about meeting
[40:47] the living God. What I find today is
[40:49] there's a lot of people who don't come
[40:52] to church to really meet God.
[40:56] &gt;&gt; They don't expect to have a oneon-one
[40:58] encounter with him.
[41:00] They may come to church because uh
[41:02] that's what church people do. They just
[41:04] go to church on Sunday.
[41:06] &gt;&gt; Some may come because there's nice
[41:08] programs, enjoyable music or a band or
[41:11] fine fellowship. Some because it's
[41:13] convenient for them,
[41:15] a better standing church. Uh some may
[41:19] come because a family attends or they
[41:22] may like the pastor, they may like the
[41:23] people. I mean, there's just different
[41:25] reasons that people come to church.
[41:27] There's all sorts of reasons.
[41:30] They all just don't seem to to come.
[41:33] They all seem to come short of the the
[41:35] right reason to come to church.
[41:38] &gt;&gt; It's hard to find people who are
[41:40] interested in wanting to build a
[41:42] character that's needed to make it into
[41:45] a rapture.
[41:48] &gt;&gt; Because that's the only thing that gets
[41:49] you in there. Not nice music, not a nice
[41:52] pastor, not a nice group of people, not
[41:54] because it's convenient, not because
[41:55] it's big, but because our lives become
[41:58] changed into his image.
[42:01] &gt;&gt; That is the purpose to come to church.
[42:04] Brother Brandham said in the message,
[42:06] the evening messenger, he said, "God has
[42:09] always counted character, not members.
[42:12] And today we do vice versa. We count
[42:15] members, good dress, well prayers
[42:19] instead of character, right? Eleaser
[42:22] sweed it out until he found character.
[42:24] That's right. Who would he get? And he
[42:27] trusted God uh character for Isaac, the
[42:30] bride, which the church is a type of.
[42:33] You know that that was the natural seed
[42:36] of Abraham. This is the royal seed of
[42:38] Abraham. Well, if Alzer the messenger
[42:41] hunting the bride was trying to find
[42:43] character, if that man comes a messenger
[42:46] of the last day trying to find the bride
[42:50] for Christ, he will not be looking for a
[42:52] denominational membership. He will look
[42:55] for a character that's willing.
[42:59] &gt;&gt; Remember, she was willing to work.
[43:01] Rebecca was willing to work. Hey, I'll
[43:03] not only give you some water, give, you
[43:04] know, water to all your camels.
[43:08] said, 'W watch good character first,
[43:10] then to get her ready to meet Isaac.
[43:12] After he found the character, then get
[43:15] her to stand still long enough to listen
[43:19] to the message of Isaac.
[43:24] &gt;&gt; Stand still long enough to listen to the
[43:27] message. That's the message of the last
[43:29] day, the evening light is first find the
[43:33] church. Where will they believe the
[43:36] message? Hunt it. Can you read what I'm
[43:38] talking about? Hunt where the church is
[43:43] that'll let even uh let you come in and
[43:47] won't just close the door on your face.
[43:50] And then when you do that, you'll find
[43:53] you find character. And now if she will
[43:57] stand still long enough to tell her how
[44:00] the bride's got to get dressed,
[44:03] she's got to be clothed. She's got to
[44:05] stand still. and if she's going to get
[44:07] it.
[44:08] So, Brother Brandham is saying here that
[44:10] the message has come, it's come with the
[44:13] gifts. It's attracted us. The
[44:15] discernment, the healing, the raising of
[44:17] the dead, all that in his ministry, it's
[44:20] attracted us.
[44:21] &gt;&gt; But now, what the prophet's saying is, I
[44:23] got to get her to stand still long
[44:25] enough to listen to the message because
[44:26] inside those tapes, it tells you what
[44:29] character you need to make it. Amen.
[44:33] &gt;&gt; Look at the little Rebecca listening to
[44:35] every word. Her little heart was
[44:37] beating.
[44:40] Now you sweat it out. Where will I go
[44:43] until I find character? That's when I
[44:46] find character. Then make her stand
[44:49] still long enough to get her ready to
[44:50] meet him. Oh my, what a striking thing.
[44:53] Wish we had a little bit more time on
[44:55] the clock. Get her ready. Stand still to
[44:57] listen to the message of him. Eleazar
[44:59] wasn't speaking of himself, but he was
[45:01] speaking of the one that sent him. And
[45:03] he had the gifts to prove that he was
[45:05] sent from him. Amen. And he wanted to
[45:07] clothe her with these things. You know
[45:08] how uh he fixed her up. If I could just
[45:12] get her to wash her face. Now he's
[45:14] speaking to brother speaking to the
[45:15] bride. Now he says, "If I could just get
[45:17] her to wash her face, now listen. Stand
[45:20] still." Notice the end time messenger,
[45:22] his job will be to get the saints ready.
[45:25] [clears throat]
[45:26] The bride's ready for the bridegroom.
[45:28] That will be his message. Now, you want
[45:31] to learn your ABCs so you can get so you
[45:34] can do algebra, he says
[45:37] &gt;&gt; later down the road.
[45:39] So, this message is really here
[45:44] to show us what's really needed.
[45:48] The all the denominations,
[45:50] they're probing. I hope we got it.
[45:53] They're assuming that what they believe
[45:56] is right. All the non-denominational
[45:59] churches,
[46:01] this message is the truth.
[46:05] &gt;&gt; It is what will judge the people of this
[46:07] last age.
[46:11] &gt;&gt; And we're so fortunate that it's been
[46:13] revealed to us
[46:14] &gt;&gt; that we don't have to go searching
[46:16] anymore. We found it. Now, all we got to
[46:19] do is stand still. Get serious with the
[46:21] word and and become what it says.
[46:24] &gt;&gt; If the word says this, just do it.
[46:27] &gt;&gt; Don't pick and choose.
[46:29] &gt;&gt; Because you pick and choose, you're not
[46:30] choosing Christ.
[46:36] &gt;&gt; We really need to get to know God more.
[46:38] Amen.
[46:40] &gt;&gt; We think we may we may know him because
[46:42] we have an idea or we know things or we
[46:45] have information, but do we really know
[46:48] God?
[46:49] &gt;&gt; Do we really have the character of
[46:51] Christ? Do we really have the gold
[46:54] that's been tried by fire as Jesus
[46:56] talked about because he invited us to
[46:59] buy gold tried to the fire that we might
[47:02] be clothed in his righteousness?
[47:05] Paul had to give up everything he
[47:07] thought he knew about God just to know
[47:10] God
[47:12] &gt;&gt; to give up his ideas even after 30 years
[47:17] &gt;&gt; of meeting God there was something in
[47:20] him that says I need to know him more
[47:23] &gt;&gt; and when you stay in contact with God
[47:26] you cannot get enough of God
[47:29] &gt;&gt; it's when you drift away from God that
[47:30] you don't think you need God anymore
[47:32] that you got enough
[47:35] Paul said, "I've suffered the loss of
[47:37] all things, and I do count them but dung
[47:40] that I might win Christ, that I might
[47:43] know him in the power of his
[47:44] resurrection, and the fellowship of his
[47:46] sufferings, being made conformable unto
[47:48] his death." God doesn't care how much we
[47:52] know,
[47:53] how smart we are, how religious we act.
[47:58] God revealed himself
[48:01] and gave the keys to the kingdom to
[48:04] someone who was ignorant and unlearned.
[48:07] &gt;&gt; Think about that. He he entrusted Peter
[48:10] with the keys of the kingdom.
[48:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[48:14] &gt;&gt; So it's not what we can attain to, it's
[48:17] how much we can love God.
[48:20] &gt;&gt; And he said, "Whatsoever you bind on
[48:22] earth, it'll be bound in heaven.
[48:24] Whatsoever thou loose on earth shall be
[48:25] loosed in heaven.
[48:28] God had to kick Saul off his high horse.
[48:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[48:32] &gt;&gt; And get him to stand still long enough
[48:34] for God to speak to him.
[48:37] &gt;&gt; God appeared to Saul in a pillar of
[48:39] fire. The Bible says a light from
[48:41] heaven. But we're we know the prophet
[48:44] told us it was the same pillar of fire
[48:46] that led the children of Israel.
[48:49] And Hebrews 12 tells us that for our God
[48:51] is a consuming fire.
[48:55] Acts 9:4 Saul fell to the earth and he
[48:58] heard a voice saying to him, "Saul,
[49:00] Saul, why are you persecuting me?"
[49:06] &gt;&gt; Paul was hurting other people.
[49:10] And God says, "You're not hurting other
[49:12] people. You're hurting me."
[49:12] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[49:13] &gt;&gt; Why is that? Because those people who
[49:16] you're hurting are standing for me.
[49:19] &gt;&gt; And when you start persecuting one of
[49:21] God's children, you're in trouble. Yeah,
[49:24] &gt;&gt; you got you got all heaven against you.
[49:27] &gt;&gt; All the angels of heaven against you.
[49:30] &gt;&gt; We need to learn to respect God's
[49:33] people.
[49:35] &gt;&gt; And he said, "Who art thou, Lord? I
[49:38] never met you."
[49:41] And the Lord said, "I am Jesus, whom
[49:43] thou persecutest. It's hard for thee to
[49:45] kick against the pricks." Amen.
[49:48] &gt;&gt; Saul, you're only causing yourself to
[49:50] suffer more when you fight against me
[49:52] because you're not going to win.
[49:54] &gt;&gt; Touch not my anointed, nor do my
[49:56] prophets any harm.
[49:59] You know, Jesus said, "What you've done
[50:00] unto the least of these little ones,
[50:02] you've done it unto me."
[50:04] &gt;&gt; We need to be careful of how we treat
[50:07] one another, how we talk to one another
[50:10] &gt;&gt; because we're speaking to God in the
[50:12] flesh with one another.
[50:16] God met Saul in the pillar of fire and
[50:18] he made him stand still so that God
[50:20] could reveal himself. Be still, Saul,
[50:23] and know that I am God.
[50:25] You're not God, Saul. I am. It's hard
[50:29] for you to fight against me. You're not
[50:31] going to get anywhere.
[50:33] &gt;&gt; And we know what happened.
[50:36] He went away for years and he got
[50:39] serious with God.
[50:43] One experience should all it take for us
[50:46] to get serious with God.
[50:48] &gt;&gt; We shouldn't need to be blessed and
[50:49] spoken to and all this.
[50:52] &gt;&gt; Look, God is only obligated to speak to
[50:54] us one time.
[50:55] &gt;&gt; That's it. After that, we need to decide
[50:58] what side we're on and that we're going
[51:00] to serve God because God can't come and
[51:03] baby us every day.
[51:06] &gt;&gt; When Paul met God, he had a choice.
[51:11] ignore the truth
[51:13] and fight against it
[51:19] or accept the truth and stand for it.
[51:24] And that's the choice that we have every
[51:25] time we come to church.
[51:28] And here we are. What are we doing?
[51:30] Sitting. Standing still
[51:36] and knowing God.
[51:39] But it's not just sitting still in a
[51:40] church.
[51:42] What we need to do is get our heart to
[51:44] stand still.
[51:45] &gt;&gt; Because God don't speak to our eyes.
[51:49] He's not speaking to our emotions. He's
[51:51] speaking to our heart.
[51:54] We have the same choice in church today
[51:57] that God is here speaking to us.
[52:00] &gt;&gt; Now, brother Brandon says, "We will
[52:02] never leave church the same way we came
[52:04] in.
[52:05] &gt;&gt; Never. we will either be closer to him
[52:08] or be drawn away. Isn't it funny that it
[52:10] happens so slightly that you can't even
[52:12] hardly tell the difference?
[52:14] &gt;&gt; People can sit in church, come to
[52:15] church, come to church, and and yet we
[52:17] see their lives, their worse. So, it's
[52:20] very easy for us to conclude when we
[52:22] look back that when they came to church,
[52:24] they really didn't accept the word, they
[52:27] rejected it quietly
[52:30] &gt;&gt; and their life became worse.
[52:33] But then you see the genuine Christian
[52:35] who's becoming like Christ.
[52:38] &gt;&gt; Slowly but surely, they're becoming more
[52:40] faithful.
[52:41] &gt;&gt; They're becoming more like Jesus.
[52:43] They're getting a a sweeter spirit.
[52:45] They're able to to take the trials more.
[52:48] They're they're willing to stand the
[52:49] test more because when they come to
[52:51] church, they receive the word of God.
[52:53] Something happens in their life.
[52:56] &gt;&gt; So, we all need to stand still and know
[52:59] God more. Turn with me to Exodus chapter
[53:02] 3. Exodus chapter 3. Moses also met God
[53:06] with fire. The reason I mention this
[53:08] part about fire is because our God is a
[53:10] consuming fire. That fire is here today.
[53:13] &gt;&gt; That fire is in this building today.
[53:16] &gt;&gt; You may not see it, but it's here.
[53:25] &gt;&gt; Exodus 3:1. And Moses kept the flock of
[53:28] Jericho, his father-in-law, the priest
[53:30] of the Midionite. And he led the flock
[53:32] to the backside of the desert, and came
[53:34] to the mountain of God, even to Horeb.
[53:37] And the angel of the Lord appeared unto
[53:39] him in a pillar of fire out of the midst
[53:42] of a bush. And he looked, and behold,
[53:46] the bush burned with fire,
[53:48] and the bush was not consumed. And Moses
[53:52] said, I will turn aside and see this
[53:54] great sight. why the bush is not burnt.
[53:58] And when the Lord saw that he turned
[54:00] said see uh aside turned aside to see
[54:04] God called him out of the midst of the
[54:07] bush and said, "Moses, Moses."
[54:11] And he said, "Here am I."
[54:15] And God said, "Draw not nigh hither. Put
[54:18] off thy shoes from off thy feet, for the
[54:20] place where thou standest is holy
[54:21] ground."
[54:23] Now, think about that.
[54:26] The message that God is wanting to send
[54:30] right off the bat is you're unworthy of
[54:34] me.
[54:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[54:37] &gt;&gt; Don't think you can just keep, you know,
[54:39] just hop in here with any old attitude.
[54:43] &gt;&gt; You need to reverence me because I am a
[54:45] holy God.
[54:47] &gt;&gt; I'm a righteous God. I'm the one that
[54:49] created you. I am your creator.
[54:53] And he deserves reverence and respect.
[54:58] And this Lord said uh and moreover he
[55:01] said, "I am the God of thy father, the
[55:03] God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of Jacob."
[55:06] And Moses hid his face, for he was
[55:09] afraid to look upon. Now notice what
[55:11] happened.
[55:12] Moses listened to the word,
[55:17] and the word humbled him.
[55:20] What happens to people who come in the
[55:21] church and they don't care about their
[55:23] attitude?
[55:26] They don't reverence themselves. They
[55:27] don't reverence the presence of God.
[55:31] &gt;&gt; And how how is God going to help a
[55:33] person like that?
[55:36] &gt;&gt; And the Lord said, "I have surely seen
[55:38] the affliction of my people which are in
[55:39] Egypt and heard their cry by the reason
[55:41] of their tasmaxes. For I know their
[55:44] sorrows, and I am come down to deliver
[55:46] them out of the land of Egypt, and to
[55:47] bring them out of the out of that land,
[55:50] on to a good land, and a large onto a
[55:55] land flown with milk and honey, unto the
[55:56] place of the Canaanites, Hittites,
[55:58] Amorites, Pasites, uh, Hivites, and the
[56:01] Jebusites. And now therefore, behold,
[56:03] the cry of the children of Israel, come
[56:05] unto me, and I have also seen the
[56:07] oppression wherein the Egyptians
[56:08] oppressed them. Come now, therefore, and
[56:10] I will send thee unto Pharaoh, that thou
[56:13] mayest bring forth my people, um, the
[56:16] children of Israel, out of Egypt. So,
[56:17] when you meet God and you leave God's
[56:20] presence, just like with Isaiah, God
[56:23] always wants to send you somewhere.
[56:27] &gt;&gt; He's got a job for you to do. God
[56:29] doesn't have a place where just
[56:31] Christians just do what they want to do
[56:32] when they leave church.
[56:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[56:34] &gt;&gt; Amen. Our God is a consuming fire. And
[56:40] that fire is here today. That same
[56:43] pillar of fire that was there, he's here
[56:45] today. How do you know that, brother
[56:46] John? Because the Bible tells me
[56:48] Revelations 1:12.
[56:51] Revelations 1:12. And brother Brandon
[56:54] brings this out in the church ages. But
[56:56] just want to show you
[57:00] uh this here.
[57:02] Now we know that this is speaking of
[57:05] John in that day in the Lord's day. But
[57:08] he says, "And I turned to see in verse
[57:10] 12 the voice of him that spake unto me.
[57:13] And being turned, I saw seven golden
[57:16] candlesticks." So here, same thing,
[57:18] turning and beholding, same as Moses.
[57:21] And in the midst of the seven golden
[57:22] candlesticks, one like the son of man,
[57:24] clothed with the garment down to his
[57:26] foot. His girth was uh about the paps
[57:29] with a golden girdle. His head was hair
[57:34] uh his head and his hair was white as
[57:37] wool
[57:38] uh like wool, as white as snow. And his
[57:41] eyes, look at this, were as a flame
[57:45] of fire.
[57:48] Hm.
[57:50] And his feet were like unto fine brass.
[57:54] We know that's judgment.
[57:56] As if burned in a furnace, and his voice
[57:58] as the sound of many waters. And we
[58:01] understand that that is the ministers
[58:03] preaching this message.
[58:06] And he had in his right hand seven
[58:08] stars. There's the messengers. And out
[58:10] of his mouth went a two-edged sword,
[58:11] which is the word of God. and his
[58:14] countenance was as the son that shineth
[58:17] in his strength.
[58:19] So the the the ministry the the word
[58:21] being preached is the strength of God.
[58:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[58:24] &gt;&gt; We can find strength in the ministry of
[58:27] God. Amen.
[58:28] &gt;&gt; And when I saw him, I fell at his feet
[58:31] dead and he laid it in and he laid his
[58:35] right hand upon me saying unto me, "Fear
[58:38] not. I am the first and the last."
[58:43] Brother Brandham said this was not God
[58:46] standing as a priest as an intercessor
[58:49] that at this time this was God as a
[58:52] judge judging
[58:55] right and this is what's happening in
[58:58] the midst of the seven golden
[58:59] candlesticks
[59:01] but it's not as it were
[59:07] uh there's two let me let me just say
[59:09] this
[59:12] what What is God doing in the church
[59:13] today?
[59:18] Okay, it's quiet because we know that if
[59:21] we answer, we might be wrong. So, we're
[59:23] not going to say anything.
[59:25] &gt;&gt; What is God doing in the church today?
[59:27] Well,
[59:28] &gt;&gt; for the bride,
[59:30] he's bringing judgment.
[59:33] The bride is being judged now.
[59:43] The word when the word is spoken the
[59:47] bride for the bride it becomes her white
[59:50] throne judgment
[59:52] &gt;&gt; because remember the Bible says that all
[59:54] must appear before the white throne
[59:56] judgment
[59:57] &gt;&gt; all
[59:59] well the bride doesn't appear before it
[1:00:01] because she's sitting with Christ on it.
[1:00:03] So in order for that scripture to be
[1:00:05] fulfilled, this is her white throne
[1:00:07] judgment right here for the bride. She
[1:00:09] comes to church to be judged by the
[1:00:11] word.
[1:00:13] &gt;&gt; Now the thing is on this side of it,
[1:00:16] there's mercy accompanied.
[1:00:19] &gt;&gt; There's mercy accompanied with their
[1:00:21] white throne judgment. But now for those
[1:00:24] who are not bride, which I'll just say
[1:00:27] it's the normal church member, they
[1:00:28] don't come to be judged. They only come
[1:00:32] for the grace, right? Come boldly before
[1:00:36] the throne of grace that you may obtain
[1:00:37] mercy. They just come for the goodness,
[1:00:39] for the for the healings, for the mercy,
[1:00:41] for help me in my life, for these
[1:00:43] things. And they're not interested in a
[1:00:45] character change.
[1:00:47] &gt;&gt; But only the word is going to change the
[1:00:50] character.
[1:00:53] &gt;&gt; So the bride is here to be judged. And
[1:00:57] this is a mature thought.
[1:01:00] But Peter said in 1 Peter chapter 4:17
[1:01:02] if you want to write it down. 1 Peter
[1:01:04] chapter 4 verse1 17. For the time is
[1:01:07] come that judgment must begin at the
[1:01:12] house of God.
[1:01:15] And if it first began at us, what shall
[1:01:19] the end be of them that obey not the
[1:01:22] gospel of God?
[1:01:25] And if the righteous scarcely be saved,
[1:01:30] &gt;&gt; where shall the ungodly and the sinner
[1:01:32] appear?
[1:01:33] &gt;&gt; Now, here's some comforting words for
[1:01:35] us. Wherefore let them that suffer
[1:01:38] according to the will of God commit the
[1:01:40] keeping of their souls to him in
[1:01:42] welloing as unto a faithful creator.
[1:01:47] &gt;&gt; Jesus said, "I have many things to say
[1:01:49] unto you, but you can't bear it now. But
[1:01:51] see, now that the Holy Ghost is here
[1:01:55] and now that we invite the Holy Ghost in
[1:01:57] our heart, we can take it.
[1:01:59] &gt;&gt; And and what what's what's the word say?
[1:02:02] Great peace have they that love my law,
[1:02:04] and nothing shall offend them
[1:02:07] &gt;&gt; because there's a there's a love for
[1:02:08] God. There's a love for his word. But
[1:02:12] the Holy Ghost is here.
[1:02:14] Jesus said, "When the Holy Ghost has
[1:02:17] come, I'll lead and guide you to all
[1:02:18] truth." But when he comes, what is he
[1:02:20] going to do? He's going to reprove,
[1:02:21] rebuke, convict.
[1:02:24] There's going to be conviction when the
[1:02:25] word comes. Because why? Not that God
[1:02:28] wants us to feel bad. Not that he wants
[1:02:29] to hammer us over the head. Not that we
[1:02:31] want to feel beaten. [clears throat]
[1:02:33] That's such a poor, negative, immature
[1:02:35] attitude.
[1:02:37] &gt;&gt; But what God is looking for, he's
[1:02:39] looking his BRIDE TO STAND STILL LONG
[1:02:42] ENOUGH THAT HE COULD GET THE WORD SO
[1:02:44] character can meet Jesus Christ.
[1:02:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:02:48] Because God didn't Abraham didn't tell
[1:02:51] Eleaser just go get any old woman.
[1:02:54] &gt;&gt; It had to get BE A SPECIFIC ONE WITH
[1:02:57] CHARACTER.
[1:02:58] &gt;&gt; One that he would spend eternity with.
[1:03:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:03:02] &gt;&gt; SO IT'S OKAY IF GOD LOOKS AT MY LIFE AND
[1:03:04] SAYS, "JOHN MARTIN, YOU'RE NOT READY
[1:03:07] YET. YOU NEED TO take care of this."
[1:03:10] &gt;&gt; There's nothing wrong with that.
[1:03:15] Can two walk together unless they agree?
[1:03:20] Amos 3:3. Can two walk together except
[1:03:23] they be agreed?
[1:03:28] &gt;&gt; The answer is no. Two cannot walk
[1:03:30] together unless they agree.
[1:03:35] &gt;&gt; And we have to be the ones that agree
[1:03:37] with God's commandments
[1:03:39] &gt;&gt; or we're not walking with him.
[1:03:44] 2 Corinthians 6:14 the Bible says, "Be
[1:03:48] ye not unequally yolked together with
[1:03:52] unbelievers?"
[1:03:55] &gt;&gt; For what fellowship have righteousness
[1:03:57] with unrighteousness? And what communion
[1:03:59] have light with darkness? And what
[1:04:02] concord have Christ with bile? Or what
[1:04:04] part have he that believeth with
[1:04:07] somebody that doesn't even believe?
[1:04:14] Now, you know what I mean about somebody
[1:04:16] that's that doesn't believe? Somebody
[1:04:19] that doesn't believe, they actually say
[1:04:21] they believe.
[1:04:23] &gt;&gt; You know what I'm saying? It's not the
[1:04:25] words they say, it's the life that
[1:04:27] they're living.
[1:04:30] &gt;&gt; And what agreement have the temple of
[1:04:32] God with idols? For you are the temple
[1:04:35] of the living God. Notice that we come
[1:04:37] to meet the living God. As God has said,
[1:04:39] I will dwell in them. I will dwell in
[1:04:42] them. Notice what happens to the
[1:04:44] believer. And I will walk in them and I
[1:04:47] will be their God, and they shall be my
[1:04:49] people.
[1:04:50] Now, that's the agreement that God has
[1:04:53] with his children that to live inside of
[1:04:56] them, to walk inside of them. Wherefore,
[1:05:00] come out from among them, meaning
[1:05:03] everybody that doesn't believe this
[1:05:06] gospel.
[1:05:07] &gt;&gt; Come on. Amen.
[1:05:10] &gt;&gt; And be ye separate, sayeth the Lord, and
[1:05:12] touch not the unclean thing, and I will
[1:05:17] receive you.
[1:05:19] &gt;&gt; So, there's something we have to do for
[1:05:22] for Christ to receive us.
[1:05:24] &gt;&gt; We can't ditto dial in the world and
[1:05:27] expect to be saved.
[1:05:29] &gt;&gt; It just doesn't work like that.
[1:05:32] And he says, "And will be a father unto
[1:05:35] you, and ye shall be my sons and
[1:05:39] daughters, saith the Lord Almighty."
[1:05:41] Isn't that beautiful?
[1:05:43] &gt;&gt; I love the word of God today.
[1:05:46] &gt;&gt; Exodus 25:8. Exodus chapter 25 verse 8.
[1:05:52] Now, [clears throat] here God is
[1:05:54] speaking to Moses about making a
[1:05:56] tabernacle
[1:06:00] in the wilderness
[1:06:02] in order for God to meet his people.
[1:06:07] And he says in verse number eight, "And
[1:06:09] let them make me a sanctuary
[1:06:12] that I may dwell among them." Now, God
[1:06:16] could simply just go and be with anybody
[1:06:18] anywhere, but he says, "I'm not doing
[1:06:21] that. Make me a sanctuary. It's going to
[1:06:24] be dedicated to me. It's going to be
[1:06:26] holy. Only certain things are going to
[1:06:28] happen in this church, and that's where
[1:06:31] I'm going to meet my people.
[1:06:33] &gt;&gt; According to all that I show thee, make
[1:06:37] this sanctuary. after the pattern of the
[1:06:40] tabernacle and the pattern of the
[1:06:42] instruments of even so shall you make
[1:06:45] it. So it had to be made according to
[1:06:47] way God wanted it to be made. Amen. This
[1:06:50] is important.
[1:06:53] You know, when I would say to brother
[1:06:54] Stan, a lot of times, uh, you know,
[1:06:56] brother Stan, he's done a lot of work
[1:06:58] for us.
[1:07:00] And sometimes we we toss ideas back and
[1:07:03] forth and but you know, I'll say to
[1:07:07] brother Stan, I'll say, "Brother Stan,
[1:07:10] just do it the way you want to. You're
[1:07:12] creative. You just give it your own
[1:07:14] signature, your own flare." And he would
[1:07:16] make it the way he wanted to. And that
[1:07:19] has become what is right now that we
[1:07:23] look at
[1:07:25] and uh we get to enjoy.
[1:07:29] But God never said to any human being,
[1:07:32] you just you just live any old life you
[1:07:35] want to and I'll accept it.
[1:07:39] Our life has to become according to the
[1:07:41] word of God
[1:07:42] &gt;&gt; after the pattern that was shown to us
[1:07:45] in this word.
[1:07:47] Drop down to verse 22.
[1:07:50] Now in this this place there's in the
[1:07:52] inside of the inside and there I will
[1:07:55] meet with thee and I will commune with
[1:07:59] thee from above the mercy seat from
[1:08:02] between the two cherubans
[1:08:04] which are upon the ark of the testimony.
[1:08:07] All the things I will give thee in
[1:08:10] commandment unto the children of Israel.
[1:08:15] God plans to meet man inside the church.
[1:08:19] Now the church in the wilderness
[1:08:21] consists of three areas. The outer
[1:08:25] circle,
[1:08:27] the outer court
[1:08:29] or what Hebrews 9:1 talks about the
[1:08:32] worldly sanctuary.
[1:08:35] Now inside that is the middle circle
[1:08:38] that we talked about
[1:08:40] and that's the inner court or what the
[1:08:43] scripture says the holy place
[1:08:46] and then inside of that is the innermost
[1:08:51] circle which is called the holiest of
[1:08:54] all.
[1:08:56] Now that is where God promised to meet
[1:08:58] man and commune with him of all his
[1:09:02] commandments.
[1:09:05] Notice why we're meeting God.
[1:09:09] &gt;&gt; We're meeting God so we can find out our
[1:09:12] instructions, what he wants us to do for
[1:09:13] our life.
[1:09:16] &gt;&gt; That's the purpose we meet with God.
[1:09:20] It's it's a different mindset why a lot
[1:09:23] of people come to church.
[1:09:26] And if we receive his word into our ark,
[1:09:30] because in the in the tabernacle in the
[1:09:33] wilderness, inside the holiest of holies
[1:09:35] was the ark of the covenant. What was
[1:09:36] inside the ark of the covenant?
[1:09:40] &gt;&gt; What was inside the ark of the covenant?
[1:09:46] &gt;&gt; Inside the ark of the covenant, well, we
[1:09:48] had Aaron's rod. Aaron's the bread that
[1:09:50] didn't get moldy. We had Aaron's rod
[1:09:52] that always budded. But there were the
[1:09:54] commandments of the Lord.
[1:09:57] &gt;&gt; The commandments of the Lord were
[1:09:58] inside. Well, you represent the ark,
[1:10:02] right? You are the church.
[1:10:04] &gt;&gt; But as we talked about last service,
[1:10:07] there's three parts of you. And the
[1:10:10] innermost part of you is the ark, the
[1:10:12] heart.
[1:10:15] &gt;&gt; And inside that ark, if you receive
[1:10:17] God's commandment inside, he will have
[1:10:19] mercy on you. Amen.
[1:10:21] &gt;&gt; But if you do not
[1:10:24] receive the word in your ark,
[1:10:26] &gt;&gt; then he'll have mercy on whom to have
[1:10:28] mercy and he'll have judgment on whom we
[1:10:31] have judgment on.
[1:10:35] &gt;&gt; So we come to church to receive the
[1:10:37] word. We should walk out with Lord, you
[1:10:40] asked me to do this and I'm going to do
[1:10:42] it.
[1:10:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:10:44] &gt;&gt; When you can say amen, I'm going to do
[1:10:46] it. You're going to receive more word.
[1:10:48] You know, when you receive more word,
[1:10:49] you know, you're going to receive more
[1:10:50] mercy.
[1:10:52] &gt;&gt; You're going to receive more grace.
[1:10:53] You're going to receive more blessings.
[1:10:55] You cannot receive the word of God
[1:10:57] without receiving more grace and more
[1:10:59] blessings from God.
[1:11:01] &gt;&gt; See, we're the bride is different.
[1:11:05] &gt;&gt; She's not the regular churchgoer that
[1:11:07] just comes to see what they can get out
[1:11:08] of church and well, I go to this church
[1:11:10] because of that, and I go to that church
[1:11:11] because of that. It's like that they
[1:11:14] don't have a vision. and they don't want
[1:11:16] to stand still long enough to hear how
[1:11:18] to get dressed.
[1:11:23] &gt;&gt; Jesus stands
[1:11:25] at the door, not of our body,
[1:11:29] not of our spirit, but our heart.
[1:11:35] And he's knocking.
[1:11:37] He wants to come in,
[1:11:40] but he can't come in where he's not
[1:11:42] welcomed.
[1:11:45] And when you welcome his word into your
[1:11:48] heart,
[1:11:51] then there's that communion that takes
[1:11:53] place, that real sweet fellowship. And
[1:11:56] I'm telling you, you can't have You ever
[1:11:58] be with somebody and you feel their
[1:12:00] presence?
[1:12:03] You've been around somebody that you
[1:12:04] just get nervous around them. Come on.
[1:12:08] &gt;&gt; You've been around somebody that just,
[1:12:09] oh, they're just so peaceful.
[1:12:12] Well, you can't you can't have Jesus in
[1:12:14] your heart and not feel the peace of
[1:12:16] God. [laughter]
[1:12:17] &gt;&gt; You can't you can't have Jesus there and
[1:12:19] not feel the joy.
[1:12:22] &gt;&gt; So, you you get blessings when you
[1:12:24] invite him in.
[1:12:25] &gt;&gt; But here's the thing. You know, you're
[1:12:28] not going to have him come in if you're
[1:12:29] not willing to stop doing what you're
[1:12:31] doing.
[1:12:33] &gt;&gt; So, there's a trade-off. He stands at
[1:12:35] the door and knocks.
[1:12:39] If any man will hear my voice,
[1:12:45] what is the voice? It's not John Martin.
[1:12:47] It's not the word John Martin is
[1:12:48] speaking. The voice is the word of God.
[1:12:52] &gt;&gt; It's the word.
[1:12:56] &gt;&gt; It It's the word that's being preached
[1:12:59] over your ark, the ark of your heart,
[1:13:03] that it means something to you
[1:13:06] and you accept it. Man shall not live by
[1:13:10] bread alone, but by every word that
[1:13:12] proceedth out of the mouth of God.
[1:13:15] As many Jesus said, as many as I love, I
[1:13:18] rebuke
[1:13:20] and I chasen.
[1:13:23] That's a different definition of how a
[1:13:25] lot of people think that God loves them.
[1:13:28] For God so loved the world that he gave
[1:13:30] his only begotten son, that should be
[1:13:31] the end of it. No, God still loves me.
[1:13:37] you know, he's trading beauty for ashes.
[1:13:39] [laughter]
[1:13:42] It's to be expected to get rebuked,
[1:13:46] &gt;&gt; but it's not it's not like we would
[1:13:48] rebuke our kids. It's not like what
[1:13:50] we're used to in this world.
[1:13:53] God speaks to us because he longs for us
[1:13:56] to be in his image.
[1:14:00] So,
[1:14:04] it's a it's beautiful.
[1:14:07] And God says, "I I I love you. I want
[1:14:10] you to be with me."
[1:14:13] &gt;&gt; Not I just want you to have a happy life
[1:14:14] here, get everything you want, and then
[1:14:17] miss going into rapture. What kind of
[1:14:19] what kind of husband would I be if I
[1:14:21] didn't tell you the truth?
[1:14:23] &gt;&gt; Right? I mean,
[1:14:27] that work, you know, Rebecca, she was
[1:14:30] willing to work more than what was asked
[1:14:33] of her.
[1:14:33] &gt;&gt; Amen. Inside the bride, there is a
[1:14:36] willingness to work all the garbage out
[1:14:38] of their life
[1:14:40] to work on keeping the commandments
[1:14:43] because it takes work. The flesh don't
[1:14:45] want to do it. You got to die daily.
[1:14:48] &gt;&gt; You got to have a hunger when you come
[1:14:50] to church. You got to mean business. You
[1:14:52] want to meet a real God. You're not
[1:14:54] satisfied with just a denominational
[1:14:56] going to church. I I I I learned this
[1:14:58] when I went to church. No, you want to
[1:15:01] walk out with a substance.
[1:15:04] Amen. Faith in the word of God is a
[1:15:07] substance.
[1:15:09] We come to this tabernacle to learn
[1:15:12] where we're standing with God.
[1:15:16] What is he doing? He's knocking on our
[1:15:20] heart.
[1:15:21] says, "I will meet you there and I will
[1:15:24] commune with you there above the mercy
[1:15:27] seat between the two cherubans
[1:15:30] which are above the ark of the testimony
[1:15:33] all of all the things which I give you
[1:15:37] in commandment."
[1:15:41] Remember
[1:15:42] we need humility
[1:15:45] in order for God to come into our
[1:15:47] hearts.
[1:15:50] If there is no humility, God's not
[1:15:52] coming in.
[1:15:54] &gt;&gt; God knocks on the door.
[1:15:59] Pride does not open the door.
[1:16:02] &gt;&gt; Pride will not open the door. God
[1:16:05] resists the proud, but he gives grace to
[1:16:06] the humble. James 4:5 says, "Do you
[1:16:10] think that the scripture saith in vain,
[1:16:11] the spirit that dwells inside of us, it
[1:16:14] lustth to envy?" So, we are born with a
[1:16:17] spirit and it's kind of like a cocka
[1:16:19] nature.
[1:16:20] that it's always one in its own will. I
[1:16:23] want, I want, I want. This is what I
[1:16:25] want. This is what I want to do. This is
[1:16:26] what I want to see happen. This is I
[1:16:28] want, I want, I want. So, it's there.
[1:16:30] It's not the scripture is not in vain.
[1:16:33] We need that scripture to tell us that.
[1:16:39] But God gives more grace. Wherefore, he
[1:16:41] say God resists the proud and gives
[1:16:43] grace to the humble. In in other words,
[1:16:46] if you're just always going to want want
[1:16:49] your will, then you're not going to get
[1:16:51] the grace of God.
[1:16:53] &gt;&gt; But if you humble yourself to the word
[1:16:56] of God,
[1:16:58] then God can help you.
[1:17:01] &gt;&gt; So verse seven, submit yourselves
[1:17:04] therefore to God. Resist the devil who's
[1:17:07] trying to get you to want, want, want,
[1:17:08] want, and he will flee from you.
[1:17:13] This is how you meet God. Draw nigh to
[1:17:15] God and he will draw nigh to you.
[1:17:18] Cleanse your hands, you sinners. Purify
[1:17:21] your hearts, you double-minded. In other
[1:17:24] words, there's some work that has to be
[1:17:26] done. You don't I mean, have you ever
[1:17:28] had dirty hands
[1:17:30] and you just walk up to the faucet,
[1:17:34] turn the water on, and you go like this,
[1:17:37] your hands don't get clean. And I know
[1:17:40] if Sister Kathleen was here, I'd say,
[1:17:42] "Sister Kathleen, how long are you
[1:17:45] supposed to work
[1:17:48] and putting your hands together and
[1:17:50] cleaning it off, scrubbing
[1:17:53] to get the germs off,
[1:17:56] you have to work at cleansing yourself,
[1:18:01] purifying your minds. Don't be
[1:18:02] double-minded. Make a decision. Stay
[1:18:04] with it."
[1:18:06] &gt;&gt; Don't be wishy-washy.
[1:18:10] The Bible says, "Don't let that man
[1:18:13] think that he'll receive anything of the
[1:18:15] Lord." You can't even be blessed in life
[1:18:18] when you're double-minded.
[1:18:22] &gt;&gt; It's not a sound mind. You're not going
[1:18:23] to get anywhere. Even if you found the
[1:18:26] right path, you just get off of it.
[1:18:31] Verse nine, be afflicted
[1:18:34] and mourn and weep. These are things
[1:18:36] that we labor to do.
[1:18:38] Let your laughter be turned to mourning.
[1:18:41] Let your joy into heaviness. Humble
[1:18:44] yourselves in the sight of the Lord that
[1:18:46] he may lift you and he shall lift you
[1:18:49] up. Notice he wants to give us
[1:18:53] the oil of joy. He wants to give us
[1:18:57] gladness
[1:18:59] for our mourning, for our sorrow. He
[1:19:02] wants to to take all the negative in our
[1:19:04] life and bless us.
[1:19:07] But we first must get to the place where
[1:19:11] we humble ourselves in the sight of God.
[1:19:14] And we let our laughter that things
[1:19:17] don't matter, let it be turned to
[1:19:18] mourning. Let our joy and our in our in
[1:19:21] our worldly joy, let it be turned to
[1:19:23] heaviness that we humble ourselves
[1:19:25] before God. Doesn't the Bible say, "If
[1:19:27] my people which are called by my name
[1:19:29] shall humble themselves,
[1:19:31] &gt;&gt; then I will hear from heaven."
[1:19:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:19:35] There's a part we have to play when we
[1:19:38] meet with God.
[1:19:42] He's a living God. We don't serve a
[1:19:44] picture on the wall.
[1:19:47] &gt;&gt; We serve someone who wants to change our
[1:19:50] life.
[1:19:51] &gt;&gt; And he's the only one THAT CAN. WE CAN'T
[1:19:54] change our life. All you got to do is be
[1:19:55] honest with yourself.
[1:19:58] Look at what you accomplished in the
[1:20:00] last month by yourself and see how much
[1:20:03] you change for the good.
[1:20:05] We need God to change us.
[1:20:09] Brother Brandham said in the message the
[1:20:11] unveiling of God. He says, "But when
[1:20:12] Moses came on the scene, he had the
[1:20:15] revelation. He had met the pillar of
[1:20:17] fire
[1:20:19] in his meeting with God. It was real."
[1:20:21] So when you do meet God, it's real.
[1:20:24] And it was revealed to Moses
[1:20:27] ho how Genesis he wrote the first four
[1:20:30] books of the Bible. Moses did. Is that
[1:20:33] right? For he met God in the form of the
[1:20:37] pillar of fire veiled in the pillar of
[1:20:39] fire.
[1:20:41] I always wondered how in the world did
[1:20:43] Moses
[1:20:44] know what happened? But God met him and
[1:20:47] revealed it to him.
[1:20:50] When Paul met him on the road,
[1:20:54] the disciples just wrote that they seen
[1:20:56] him do. But Moses had the revelation,
[1:21:00] went down into Egypt for three years and
[1:21:03] studied and seen God of the Old
[1:21:05] Testament where Jesus of the New
[1:21:07] Testament, the revelation, and Paul
[1:21:09] said, "I was not disobedient to the
[1:21:10] heavenly vision." That's right. And
[1:21:14] think of it, that same pillar of fire
[1:21:16] that came upon those men who wrote the
[1:21:19] Bible is the same pillar of fire here
[1:21:22] today
[1:21:24] &gt;&gt; interpreting the Bible. Amen. How can we
[1:21:28] thank him for that? Same. How can we
[1:21:31] thank him for that? Same. What a
[1:21:34] comfort. What an identification. I'm so
[1:21:37] glad to be identified with that. I don't
[1:21:39] know what I would do. I'd rather be I I'
[1:21:42] I'd rather be identified with that
[1:21:44] meaning the pillar of fire than all the
[1:21:47] Baptist, Methodist, Presbyterian,
[1:21:49] Lutheran, and all the rest of them
[1:21:52] identified in that word where that
[1:21:53] shakana glory and the revelation lays
[1:21:59] the pillar of fire appearing visibly
[1:22:01] among us identifying that the message is
[1:22:04] right like he did at Mount Si. Remember
[1:22:07] before the true message come forth,
[1:22:09] Moses preached and he laid them led them
[1:22:12] out of Egypt. But there before the real
[1:22:14] commandment was laid, the seal was
[1:22:17] brought in. God come down before the
[1:22:21] people and prove that Moses was sent
[1:22:23] from him. Is that right? In a pillar of
[1:22:24] fire that Moses said he had seen a in a
[1:22:27] burning bush and talk to him. Oh, in the
[1:22:30] last days to see that same pillar of
[1:22:31] fire among us speaking the same word.
[1:22:34] Not only that, but interpreting it by
[1:22:38] making it manifest and proving that it
[1:22:40] is true. I would rather stand with the
[1:22:43] message of the hour than what any man
[1:22:46] could say.
[1:22:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:22:50] I'd rather stay with the man that God
[1:22:54] sent as a seventh age messenger to tell
[1:22:57] me how to make it
[1:22:59] &gt;&gt; than to lean to my own understanding and
[1:23:02] listen to 15 other people
[1:23:04] &gt;&gt; try to find out.
[1:23:10] So, brother Rand says, "So, the people
[1:23:13] has not one way to disbelieve
[1:23:17] unless they just willingly want to."
[1:23:20] That's scary.
[1:23:22] And then he quotes the scripture. If
[1:23:25] that sin, if they sin willfully after
[1:23:28] they've received the knowledge of truth,
[1:23:30] there remainth no more sacrifice for
[1:23:32] sin.
[1:23:34] Notice the same pillar of fire sent to
[1:23:37] Moses and to Paul that wrote the Bible
[1:23:39] now sent to reveal it. That's through
[1:23:42] the ministry of Malachi 4:5. The grace
[1:23:46] of God, the unchanging God, the
[1:23:48] fulfilling of the promises of Matthew
[1:23:50] 20, law, I'm with you always. Fulfilling
[1:23:52] St. John 14:12, the works I do, you
[1:23:54] shall do also. Fulfilling Luke 17:28:29,
[1:23:58] in the last days, the son of man will be
[1:24:00] revealed in Malachi 4. Behold, I send
[1:24:02] you Elijah the prophet be and he will
[1:24:05] restore the faith of the people back to
[1:24:07] the original word.
[1:24:10] Oh my. He died to reveal himself to us.
[1:24:14] Brother Bham says, "Now let us die to
[1:24:16] self to reveal him to others."
[1:24:23] &gt;&gt; Let us die to our traditions and things
[1:24:25] to reveal him to others. Die to
[1:24:27] denomination to reveal him to others.
[1:24:30] We've got to die to what we want to do
[1:24:31] with our own time
[1:24:35] &gt;&gt; and take our time and share this message
[1:24:38] with somebody.
[1:24:40] I'm just going to be perfectly honest
[1:24:42] with you.
[1:24:45] The most important thing that God wants
[1:24:48] us to do is to receive the message of
[1:24:51] the hour.
[1:24:53] Now, I don't mean as a as a some sticker
[1:24:57] you put on the wall that says, "Yes, I
[1:24:59] believe the message of the hour." But
[1:25:01] you receive it into your life. That's
[1:25:03] the first thing that God wants you to
[1:25:05] do. The second thing he wants you to do
[1:25:07] is go give this message to somebody.
[1:25:12] &gt;&gt; And number two doesn't stop.
[1:25:15] &gt;&gt; You go give it to somebody else. And
[1:25:18] this will make God happier than anything
[1:25:20] you could possibly do on the planet
[1:25:22] because this is the will of God.
[1:25:29] Exodus chapter 29.
[1:25:34] Now, we only got about
[1:25:38] 56 more minutes.
[1:25:43] I don't know how we can quite condense
[1:25:45] it.
[1:25:49] But I I want to meet God.
[1:25:52] &gt;&gt; I want to meet God.
[1:26:00] We won't be able to do everything, but
[1:26:02] we want to do just a few more things if
[1:26:04] we could. Exodus 29 starting with verse
[1:26:07] 42. This shall be a continual burnt
[1:26:10] offering throughout your generation at
[1:26:14] the door of the tabernacle of the
[1:26:16] congregation before the Lord, where I
[1:26:20] will meet you to speak there unto thee,
[1:26:25] and there I will meet with the children
[1:26:27] of Israel, and the tabernacle shall be
[1:26:30] sanctified by my glory. And I will
[1:26:33] sanctify the tabernacle of the
[1:26:35] congregation and the altar. I will
[1:26:37] sanctify also both Aaron and his sons to
[1:26:40] minister to me in the priest's office.
[1:26:43] And I will dwell among the children of
[1:26:45] Israel, and I will be their God, and
[1:26:47] they shall know
[1:26:50] that I am the Lord their God that
[1:26:52] brought them forth out of the land of
[1:26:54] Egypt, that I may dwell among them, and
[1:26:57] I am the Lord their God. Be still and
[1:27:02] know that I am God. I will be exalted
[1:27:05] among you. God is wanting us to be still
[1:27:09] in our spirit.
[1:27:12] Be still in our heart.
[1:27:15] Really focus on the word that's being
[1:27:17] ministered
[1:27:19] because God is trying to get our
[1:27:21] attention.
[1:27:23] He's wanting to reveal his will for our
[1:27:25] life personally.
[1:27:27] I'm just being honest with you. What
[1:27:29] good would it do for brother Stan if ev
[1:27:33] if God spoke to everybody here and they
[1:27:37] all received the will of God for their
[1:27:40] life but brother Stan didn't receive it.
[1:27:42] What good would it do for brother Stan?
[1:27:46] All of us are in the same place where
[1:27:49] all of us are in the same place. We all
[1:27:51] must desperately hear from God. Amen.
[1:27:56] &gt;&gt; The the when I come to church, the
[1:27:58] message is not for somebody else.
[1:28:00] &gt;&gt; When I come to church, the message is
[1:28:02] for me.
[1:28:04] &gt;&gt; Because if I don't receive Christ, what
[1:28:07] he has for me, then my gathering is in
[1:28:09] vain.
[1:28:13] &gt;&gt; All right, we're coming down to it. John
[1:28:14] chapter 14.
[1:28:16] So that that is a that's speaking of of
[1:28:19] the the natural tabernacle now that we
[1:28:22] heard. But now we're going to come back
[1:28:24] down. Just kind of going back and forth,
[1:28:26] but the same thing typing back and forth
[1:28:28] with our tabernacle, our bodies,
[1:28:32] God coming in communion with us. John
[1:28:36] chapter 14 verse 15 says, "If you love
[1:28:39] me, keep his commandments." Now, this is
[1:28:41] his theme as we read the rest of the
[1:28:43] verses.
[1:28:45] If you love me, be interested in what
[1:28:47] I'm saying at church.
[1:28:52] And I will pray the father and he will
[1:28:56] give you another comforter that he may
[1:28:58] abide with you forever.
[1:29:02] And even the spirit of truth whom the
[1:29:04] world cannot receive because it seeth
[1:29:06] him not neither knoweth him but you know
[1:29:08] him
[1:29:10] for he dwelleth with you and shall be in
[1:29:12] you. Now notice he's speaking of the
[1:29:15] spirit of truth. He's speaking of the
[1:29:16] comforter, but Jesus is talking to his
[1:29:19] disciples and he's speaking of himself.
[1:29:22] &gt;&gt; He said, "For he dwells with you. I've
[1:29:25] been with you." He told Peter, "Philip,
[1:29:27] have you seen Have you not seen I've
[1:29:30] been with you this this long and you
[1:29:31] haven't seen the father?"
[1:29:35] So he says, "No, the world don't see
[1:29:37] him." Of course, the world didn't see
[1:29:39] Jesus, right?
[1:29:40] &gt;&gt; I mean, they saw him with their natural
[1:29:42] eyes, but they didn't know he was the
[1:29:44] son of God.
[1:29:46] They just, you know, give us Barabbus.
[1:29:47] They just, he was just un not
[1:29:50] interesting to them
[1:29:53] because they didn't follow their
[1:29:54] traditions. But he says that the spirit
[1:29:57] of truth, he said he dwelleth with you
[1:30:00] and shall be further future tense shall
[1:30:04] be inside of you.
[1:30:06] &gt;&gt; This is now. This is right now today.
[1:30:11] And I will not leave you comfortless.
[1:30:14] I will come to you.
[1:30:17] Yet a little while the world seeth me no
[1:30:19] more, but you shall see me because I
[1:30:20] live, you shall live also. At that day
[1:30:23] you shall know that I'm in the father
[1:30:24] and you in me and I in you. Now he goes
[1:30:27] back to this commandment.
[1:30:30] He that has my commandment and keeps
[1:30:33] them. Notice you've got to hear the
[1:30:36] word. You've got to say, Lord, I will do
[1:30:38] this word when I leave.
[1:30:40] He it is that loves me, and he that
[1:30:44] loves me shall be loved of my father,
[1:30:47] and I will love him, and will manifest
[1:30:50] myself to him. What a communion.
[1:30:55] What a communion.
[1:30:57] And Judas saith unto him, not as scary,
[1:30:59] Lord, how is it that you're going to
[1:31:00] manifest yourself to us, but not to
[1:31:02] anybody else in the world? And Jesus
[1:31:05] answered and said unto him, "If a man
[1:31:08] loves me, he will keep my words and my
[1:31:12] father will love him and we will come
[1:31:14] unto him and make our abode with him."
[1:31:20] Meeting God.
[1:31:22] It all starts when we hear the word of
[1:31:24] God that we we don't just say amen
[1:31:27] because it's a natural thing to say, but
[1:31:30] we really we we mean what that word
[1:31:33] says, what it what it says, which means
[1:31:35] so be it.
[1:31:37] &gt;&gt; So be it in my life, Lord. I want to get
[1:31:40] dressed for the rapture.
[1:31:42] &gt;&gt; I want to have something more on today
[1:31:46] that I need to get ready. We only have
[1:31:49] so much time to get ready. We need to
[1:31:52] take advantage of the time. We need to
[1:31:55] better walk away from church and say,
[1:31:56] "God spoke to me this. God spoke to my
[1:32:00] heart." Because if we don't hear God
[1:32:02] speak to our heart, something personal,
[1:32:04] then it's just us building the church.
[1:32:06] And unless God builds the church, they
[1:32:08] that labor labor in vain.
[1:32:11] &gt;&gt; GOD, WE'VE got to hear God's voice.
[1:32:14] &gt;&gt; Obedience is better than sacrifice.
[1:32:17] &gt;&gt; We just got to get more serious with
[1:32:19] meeting God. coming to church to meet
[1:32:21] with him.
[1:32:28] Pages I just have to throw to the side
[1:32:32] because time
[1:32:34] is all is up.
[1:32:40] God
[1:32:43] wants to give us
[1:32:46] beauty for ashes.
[1:32:50] He wants to fulfill all of our needs.
[1:32:53] He wants to have a real But more than
[1:32:56] that, what does he want? Fellowship,
[1:33:01] &gt;&gt; communion.
[1:33:03] He wants us to be interested in what
[1:33:05] he's interested in. Did you ever ever
[1:33:07] have a relationship with somebody and it
[1:33:09] was always about them?
[1:33:12] You know, like
[1:33:15] you don't have hardly any. It's never
[1:33:17] 50-50 in the decisions.
[1:33:20] It's always what they want.
[1:33:24] And and Jesus said, "All that ever came
[1:33:27] before me are thieves, robbers. They
[1:33:31] just want what they want. They they want
[1:33:33] all these things from me, but they're
[1:33:35] not interested in my commandments."
[1:33:38] &gt;&gt; And God just wants, you know, he's not
[1:33:40] going to say anything against anybody
[1:33:42] who doesn't want to keep his
[1:33:43] commandments. You know, God is such a
[1:33:45] beautiful God.
[1:33:47] But understand,
[1:33:50] there's a bride that's coming out of
[1:33:51] this church.
[1:33:54] I I think we should just be shouting
[1:33:56] from glory with that statement. There is
[1:33:58] a bride coming out of this church. I
[1:34:01] believe it with all my heart.
[1:34:05] Now, the word that's preached for this
[1:34:06] pulpit isn't for everybody,
[1:34:09] but I do believe it's for the bride.
[1:34:12] Amen.
[1:34:14] [clears throat]
[1:34:14] &gt;&gt; And and they will they will be happy
[1:34:16] about it. They'll be glad about it
[1:34:18] because it's what is needed to make it.
[1:34:22] &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's stand together. God bless
[1:34:24] you.
[1:34:30] Meeting with the living God.
[1:34:32] Think about how privileged we are to
[1:34:35] know that God,
[1:34:37] he cares
[1:34:40] and loves his word so much and he's
[1:34:41] trying to get it to us.
[1:34:46] &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's sing that little chorus. He
[1:34:48] is here.
