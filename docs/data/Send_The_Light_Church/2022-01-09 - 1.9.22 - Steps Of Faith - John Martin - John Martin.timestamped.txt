[32:45] in the precious name of jesus christ we
[32:47] pray
[32:48] amen
[32:50] romans chapter 4
[32:52] verse number 11
[32:55] and 12
[33:01] the scripture says that he receiveth the
[33:03] sign of circumcision
[33:05] a seal of the righteousness of the faith
[33:08] which he had yet been uncircumcised that
[33:11] he might be
[33:12] the father of all them that believe
[33:15] though they be not circumcised that
[33:17] their righteousness might be imputed
[33:19] unto them also
[33:21] and the father of circumcision to them
[33:23] who are not of the circumcision only
[33:26] but who also walk
[33:29] in the steps
[33:30] of that faith of our father abraham
[33:33] which he had
[33:34] been yet
[33:36] uncircumcised amen god bless you may be
[33:39] seated we want to title this message
[33:41] steps of faith
[33:44] steps of faith
[33:46] um before we
[33:48] go that we had some pictures we wanted
[33:49] to show this is brother boaz sent these
[33:52] to us this this morning and just today
[33:56] he baptized five people amen and so i
[33:59] just wanted to share with you what he
[34:00] shared with us
[34:02] i know that you're giving for the cause
[34:04] there
[34:04] in india
[34:06] and it's just good to know
[34:09] that there are others all over the world
[34:10] pressing on amen bring jesus
[34:14] amen
[34:15] we appreciate brother boaz
[34:21] yes what a wonderful wonderful pictures
[34:24] amen let's continue to hold him up he
[34:27] sends his greetings to the church
[34:30] we certainly like that
[34:32] song that was sung today higher ground
[34:36] i believe that's what we need to be
[34:37] pressing into
[34:39] amen
[34:42] our faith must not be in any other thing
[34:44] but the pure word of god amen when you
[34:48] hear from god that true faith will
[34:50] simply
[34:52] allow you a place to rest
[34:55] right you're not up and down amen god
[34:58] can't lie
[35:00] brother branham said faith's final
[35:01] resting place is in the word of god amen
[35:05] and so it's important when god for god
[35:07] to speak to us if god doesn't speak to
[35:10] us
[35:11] we can't have faith in it
[35:17] our faith only goes so far in the word
[35:19] of god
[35:20] how many people read this that we know
[35:22] this to be the truth and when people
[35:24] read it yet they can't believe it
[35:26] right
[35:28] so it's not just saying this is true
[35:30] but it's having that word spoken to you
[35:33] amen to where it becomes
[35:35] a place where you can rest in it
[35:37] yourself
[35:41] now with each step of faith that we take
[35:43] in god's word
[35:44] god will pour out a greater blessing
[35:48] so our subject today we want to speak on
[35:51] blessings for believing
[35:53] entitled this steps of faith
[35:56] there are steps of faith that every
[35:58] believer must walk
[36:01] notice this walk is not a walk on the
[36:04] sidewalk
[36:06] i like to view it today as a as a
[36:08] stairway now
[36:10] whether you
[36:11] you you view it
[36:12] in in a walk on a sidewalk or a ladder
[36:16] it really doesn't matter
[36:18] because
[36:19] you
[36:20] you're you're moving forward that's the
[36:23] main thing but the reason i want to look
[36:25] at it as a ladder is because it's
[36:27] you're it's it's harder
[36:30] it's harder to go up number one and
[36:32] number two as you
[36:34] uh as you're following the lord
[36:37] um it gets harder
[36:39] as you go up the statue of a perfect man
[36:42] everybody's got faith down here but as
[36:45] you move up that perfect love there's
[36:46] only a few that have it right it's so
[36:49] it's it just becomes harder
[36:53] and um
[36:55] if if i could say it like this brother
[36:57] branham makes the statement says god is
[36:59] not obligated to give you any more until
[37:02] you walk in the light that he's already
[37:04] given you that's right amen
[37:07] it's important to understand steps of
[37:09] faith and that you got to take him in
[37:10] order
[37:12] um when you jumped out of
[37:14] bed today the next step you took was not
[37:17] into the sanctuary
[37:19] you had to walk certain steps to get in
[37:22] your car and then your car drove here
[37:24] and you got to get out of part lot and
[37:25] then you came in here it's no different
[37:27] where the lord is taking us
[37:31] jesus said how can you be faithful
[37:34] in the few in the things of god if you
[37:37] haven't been faithful in another man's
[37:39] things
[37:40] so we have to learn to be faithful and
[37:42] take the steps that he's placed in front
[37:44] of us before he'll give us more
[37:48] peter said in second peter chapter one
[37:50] verse five he said besides
[37:52] this giving all diligence add to your
[37:54] faith virtue
[37:56] virtue knowledge
[37:59] and to your knowledge add temperance
[38:01] it's an emphasis add patience and to
[38:03] patients add godliness notice it's an
[38:06] addie
[38:08] this is supposed to be being added to
[38:10] our life
[38:11] and godliness to brotherly kindness into
[38:13] brotherly kindness ad
[38:15] charity amen so you're you're adding
[38:18] you're you're moving forward you're
[38:19] taking a step of faith each time
[38:24] for if these things be in you and abound
[38:26] they make you that you shouldn't need to
[38:27] be barren or unfruitful
[38:30] that means no matter what situation
[38:32] comes up the god inside of you meets it
[38:34] meets the need amen amen you're not
[38:37] lacking you're not you're not bearing
[38:38] you're not unfruitful you don't you
[38:40] don't know what to do or how to un
[38:42] handle it but you're trusting in the
[38:43] living god
[38:45] and he just shines through you
[38:47] but he that lacketh these things is
[38:48] blind cannot see a fire off and is
[38:50] forgotten that he was even perched from
[38:52] his own
[38:54] sins
[38:56] so we don't ever
[38:58] want
[38:59] to be unfruitful
[39:03] if we lack these steps spiritually
[39:06] we won't be able to handle things
[39:10] so we want to take these steps we don't
[39:12] want to leave any out
[39:16] there are steps to a christian walk
[39:19] brother ram taught us justification
[39:20] sanctification baptism of the holy ghost
[39:24] these are steps
[39:25] brother brandon went on to say that
[39:27] the baptism of the holy ghost made way
[39:29] for the holy ghost himself to come and
[39:31] live in us
[39:33] peter said repent and be baptized every
[39:35] one of you in the name of jesus christ
[39:37] for the remission of sins and you shall
[39:39] receive the gift of the holy ghost
[39:43] so we see here there's there's steps
[39:45] that need to be taken
[39:46] amen
[39:49] there are steps of faith that every
[39:52] believer must walk
[39:55] we must learn to be faithful to what god
[39:57] has asked us to do before trying to do
[39:59] something else
[40:01] i think there's a big problem with that
[40:02] we just kind of ignore certain things
[40:04] that god tells us and we try to go on
[40:06] with other things in our life and we're
[40:08] going to end up coming short
[40:12] god is a master builder he's know what
[40:13] he's doing and if he put something in
[40:15] front of us he wants us to move forward
[40:17] in it
[40:18] amen
[40:19] we look at the steps of faith that our
[40:21] our father abraham took they weren't
[40:23] easy
[40:25] they weren't easy by no means
[40:28] and it took a long time
[40:30] from the time that he got called out to
[40:32] the time he offered isaac i mean there's
[40:35] a lot of years there
[40:36] right
[40:37] it was over 30 years yes but we look at
[40:40] it as a story
[40:42] that just happened in i don't want to
[40:44] say minutes but we think about the story
[40:46] in minutes and we think well you know
[40:48] that's not a big deal it happened
[40:51] no but it happened such a long trial in
[40:53] this man's life
[40:57] see we're not alone with what we're
[40:58] going through
[41:02] he started
[41:04] absolutely
[41:05] 100
[41:07] correct
[41:08] but did you know he wasn't perfected
[41:10] until the end
[41:13] that's what the scriptures tell us
[41:16] because god is expecting more out of us
[41:18] he wants us to continue taking steps
[41:20] not the steps that we haven't taken are
[41:22] not right not saying that but there's
[41:24] more amen
[41:26] some believers start to feel
[41:28] like they've graduated from the altar
[41:32] come on
[41:34] like i'm beyond that point
[41:37] don't ever get beyond the point of the
[41:38] altar right amen
[41:41] the first step that abraham
[41:43] took was when he was called out he had
[41:45] to separate from his natural family in
[41:47] genesis chapter 12 verse 1 i want to
[41:49] start reading now the lord had said unto
[41:51] abraham get thee out
[41:53] of thy country
[41:55] and from thy kindred
[41:58] and from thy father's house
[42:00] unto a land that i was shelby now notice
[42:03] everything that happened in abraham's
[42:05] life in the natural is a type of what
[42:08] happens to us in the spiritual
[42:11] our land is not natural our land is the
[42:14] nature of jesus christ
[42:19] and it's filled with the giants of
[42:21] selfishness
[42:26] and look he says i will make you a great
[42:28] nation and i will bless thee
[42:30] and i'll make thy name great
[42:32] and thou shalt be a blessing
[42:34] and i will bless them that bless thee
[42:36] and i'll curse them that curse thee and
[42:38] in thee shall all the families of the
[42:39] earth be blessed both i'll say it like
[42:41] this natural and spiritual
[42:46] so abraham departed
[42:48] as the lord had spoken unto him
[42:50] and lot went with him and abraham was 75
[42:55] 75 years old when he had departed of
[42:57] haren
[42:59] and abram
[43:01] took sarah's wife and lot his brother's
[43:03] son
[43:04] and all their substance
[43:06] that they had gathered and the souls
[43:08] that were they had gotten in heron
[43:11] and they went for to go into the land of
[43:13] canaan into the land of canaan they came
[43:16] so they heard god's voice god spoke to
[43:18] them the first thing god says come out
[43:21] of the world
[43:22] separate yourself from the world
[43:25] separate yourself from from anything
[43:27] that's that's worldly
[43:33] it's the first step that every believer
[43:34] has to take
[43:37] if you want to walk with god you got to
[43:38] separate yourself from the world
[43:42] now notice abraham didn't have somebody
[43:44] to go to and ask him what do you think
[43:46] do i need to do this
[43:48] can i still make it with god without
[43:49] doing this
[43:51] no he heard from god
[43:53] in his heart
[43:55] and he just obeyed it
[43:58] this is the first step we got to do
[44:01] and i'll say it like this no matter how
[44:02] much we've come out of the world there's
[44:04] still more of the world that god's
[44:05] trying to get out of us
[44:08] and even if he's taken all of it out at
[44:11] one time satan has a way of letting it
[44:12] slip back in
[44:16] so he started walking in the direction
[44:17] of the promised land
[44:19] or up the ladder towards
[44:21] the promise of god however you want to
[44:23] say it
[44:24] by faith we must separate and how we
[44:27] separate is we become obedient to what
[44:30] he has spoken
[44:33] you can't just say i believe and don't
[44:35] do nothing you can't sit there he
[44:37] couldn't sit there back in in his land
[44:40] where he was and say you know i believe
[44:42] god he spoke to me
[44:47] if you believe you will obey
[44:50] amen
[44:52] you'll take that step of faith even
[44:54] though you don't feel like it you don't
[44:55] want to leave your family you don't want
[44:57] to do the
[44:58] you you just like the comfortableness of
[45:00] where you're at you've got to walk by
[45:02] faith you got to take that step and and
[45:04] you you do that by the work of obedience
[45:12] the bible says in isaiah 55 verse 8 for
[45:15] my thoughts are not your thoughts
[45:16] neither are my ways your way saith the
[45:18] lord
[45:19] for as the heavens are higher than the
[45:20] earth so are my ways they're higher than
[45:23] your ways and my thoughts and your
[45:25] thoughts it wasn't like abraham was just
[45:28] like in a chaotic condition and he had
[45:31] problems with all his family he didn't
[45:33] get along with anybody and he couldn't
[45:34] wait to get out of there anyways it
[45:36] wasn't like that right
[45:38] he was very happy where he was
[45:44] but there was something calling him
[45:45] higher
[45:51] god's way of thinking is always higher
[45:53] for us
[45:54] and if it's higher of course we're not
[45:56] going to understand it
[45:58] our understanding is limited
[46:01] it goes so far and that's it
[46:04] so
[46:05] what do we need understanding for when
[46:06] we got faith
[46:09] when you've truly heard from god what do
[46:11] we need understanding for
[46:15] can you imagine
[46:16] uh noah saying no way never seen rain
[46:19] ain't doing it nope
[46:20] what i need to build an art for it's
[46:22] going to sit here it's going to be
[46:23] they're just going to make fun of me
[46:26] you don't need understanding if you got
[46:28] faith if you heard from god you have no
[46:30] problem doing what god tells you to do
[46:33] it's only when you don't hear from god
[46:34] and it becomes some letter
[46:37] some written letter
[46:40] amen hebrews chapter 11 verse 8 by faith
[46:42] abraham
[46:43] when he was called out
[46:45] into a place
[46:47] which he should afterwards receive for
[46:49] an adherence he obeyed
[46:53] so he got by faith he heard from god and
[46:55] then he obeyed and he went out look at
[46:58] this not knowing whether he went he
[47:01] didn't even know
[47:04] and i'll tell you brother sister when i
[47:05] came in this message i didn't know
[47:07] nothing about it
[47:10] but something inside of me told me to
[47:12] walk in it
[47:16] it's what establishes our life
[47:23] takes out all the guesswork
[47:27] it was many years before abraham had
[47:30] received the promise and really in part
[47:32] in part he didn't
[47:34] he wasn't able to experience all of it
[47:36] himself
[47:40] so i want to say to you don't expect god
[47:42] to make a great name out of you in a
[47:44] couple years
[47:47] abraham never saw this great nation amen
[47:50] or his name become great
[47:52] he didn't see all the families of the
[47:54] earth blessed
[47:55] he never seen all the blessings that god
[47:57] bestowed on others that blessed him he
[48:00] didn't see all the curses that uh
[48:02] that uh god put on others for cursing
[48:05] him
[48:08] yet it was his promise and he stepped
[48:10] out by faith and he obeyed what god told
[48:12] him to do
[48:15] there were many steps that abraham took
[48:17] as he sojourned
[48:19] he went through many things in his life
[48:20] he went through many lands and trials
[48:23] and famines and difficulties and each
[48:25] step he took he had to take it by faith
[48:28] he stepped out in obedience
[48:30] and that obedience brought another
[48:32] blessing a greater blessing to him
[48:40] there are many steps
[48:42] that we
[48:43] as christians must take
[48:46] god doesn't want us getting ahead of
[48:48] ourselves or ahead of his leading
[48:51] he wants us to be faithful with what he
[48:53] just told us to do
[48:55] what he just placed in front of us
[48:57] don't ignore it don't forget about
[49:00] it don't dissect the word don't question
[49:04] what's being preached
[49:06] i'll say amen to that not that i believe
[49:08] that uh
[49:10] my preaching is perfect but the problem
[49:13] is either we believe or where god told
[49:15] us to be or we don't
[49:17] right amen
[49:19] if you start dissecting one thing you
[49:21] start questioning one thing you start
[49:23] doubting one thing then you know what it
[49:25] just opens the door every time you come
[49:26] to church
[49:29] we need to learn to walk each step
[49:32] faithfully
[49:34] be ready for the next step that god
[49:36] gives you
[49:38] i i feel that i would be totally lost
[49:41] if i was in a church
[49:43] that i had to question
[49:45] the leadership of the church
[49:51] i think god has something better for his
[49:52] people
[49:55] i think god has something better for his
[49:57] people
[50:00] no wonder brother brian says make sure
[50:02] you choose your church
[50:05] not like you chose your wife
[50:08] in other words be more sure about it
[50:10] how can we be more sure about the wife
[50:13] we chose
[50:15] because when we chose our wife we
[50:17] thought this is it
[50:20] you can't choose a church like this like
[50:22] i think this is it
[50:24] you've got to know that you know that
[50:25] you know that you know
[50:32] well brother john i just don't know
[50:33] we'll spend some time with god you're
[50:35] here
[50:36] if you really want to hear you will hear
[50:43] there were many tests that abraham went
[50:44] through and each test that he passed
[50:47] proved he had faith yes
[50:51] if you don't pass the test it doesn't
[50:54] prove you have faith
[50:56] he was faithful to do what god god asked
[50:58] him to do
[51:01] now there came a time in abraham's walk
[51:03] with god
[51:04] that in order to get any closer to god
[51:07] to walk any
[51:08] further into god any higher with god he
[51:12] was told that he had to separate from
[51:14] the very family member that he came out
[51:16] of the world with yes
[51:19] think about that
[51:20] it wasn't an option abraham i need you
[51:23] to consider you know
[51:25] either or with lot
[51:28] it was a must
[51:33] amen god allowed there to be a family
[51:35] strife in genesis chapter 13 verse 8 and
[51:38] abram said unto lot let there be no
[51:41] strife yes i love the spirit of abraham
[51:44] he endeavored to keep the unity of the
[51:46] spirit let there be no strife i pray
[51:49] thee between me and thee between my
[51:51] herman and i
[51:53] a herven
[51:54] for we
[51:55] be
[51:56] brethren yes amen amen
[52:00] brethren
[52:02] amen that's abraham's view
[52:09] even though lot
[52:10] was a mate believer
[52:15] abraham still conducted his spirit as a
[52:18] believer
[52:23] verse 9 is not the whole land before
[52:26] thee
[52:27] separate thyself i pray thee from me
[52:31] if you take the left then i'll go to the
[52:33] right
[52:34] if you depart to the right then i'll go
[52:36] to the left he didn't manipulate the
[52:38] situation amen
[52:41] he trusted in god right amen
[52:48] you know a lot of times
[52:50] god gives us a choice
[52:54] what we're going to do with what
[52:56] we're given
[53:00] and lot lifted up his eyes and beheld
[53:02] all the plane of jordan
[53:04] that it was well watered everywhere
[53:06] before the lord destroyed sodom and
[53:09] gomor even as the garden of the lord
[53:13] like the land of egypt as thou cometh
[53:15] unto zorah
[53:17] that must have been a beautiful land
[53:19] like the garden of the lord the garden
[53:21] of eden
[53:23] this has been beautiful
[53:25] then lot chose him all the plane of
[53:27] jordan
[53:28] and lot journeyed east
[53:31] and they separated themselves one from
[53:33] the other
[53:34] lot chose for himself all the plain easy
[53:40] way amen no hills no valleys
[53:43] plenty of easy water to get to for his
[53:46] camels and always all that he was taking
[53:49] care of so he wouldn't have to work hard
[53:54] easy labors
[53:56] remember when god gives you a choice
[53:58] never choose the easy way never never
[54:01] never choose the easy way
[54:04] god's way is and always will be the
[54:06] harder way amen
[54:15] don't don't just i'm gonna hop in church
[54:18] i'm gonna expect everybody else to labor
[54:19] to get the atmosphere right
[54:23] you be the one to work for it amen you
[54:25] want god to bless you you labor amen
[54:31] matthew chapter 7 verse 13 says enter ye
[54:34] in at the straight gate for wide is the
[54:36] gate and broad is the way that leads to
[54:38] destruction and many there be which go
[54:40] on there at because strait is the gate
[54:43] jesus told us under the straight gate
[54:45] strait is the gate and narrows the way
[54:47] which lead unto life and few be that
[54:49] find it
[54:52] why won't they find it because most
[54:54] believers are looking for god the
[54:57] easiest possible way
[55:00] the way of least resistance
[55:03] they're still looking
[55:05] still wanting
[55:07] but they're looking the broad way
[55:10] i love the example
[55:11] that the prophet laid out
[55:13] i say for me i take it personally
[55:16] it was really for the whole bride us i'm
[55:18] taking it from me he shared it in the
[55:20] true easter seal
[55:22] this is what god said to him
[55:24] he said because thou has chosen the
[55:26] narrow path
[55:27] the harder way
[55:29] thou has walked of your own choosing
[55:33] thou has picked the correct and precise
[55:37] decision and it is my way
[55:40] that is not what law lot chose
[55:45] he had a choice
[55:46] he wasn't manipulated
[55:48] he could have chose god's way
[55:51] but he chose the easier path
[55:56] brother man says bless god it's
[55:58] my way he said
[56:00] because of this momentous decision a
[56:03] huge part of heaven awaits thee
[56:06] what a glorious decision thou has made
[56:09] this in itself is that which will give
[56:11] and may come to pass the tremendous
[56:13] victory in
[56:15] the love divine right now notice
[56:18] choosing the harder way
[56:21] brings you to the pentacle
[56:23] of love divine
[56:26] think about that statement it's true
[56:29] it all depends on what our goal was
[56:32] let's go
[56:34] was not that pentacle
[56:35] a perfect love amen
[56:38] he was just glued on what was easy for
[56:40] right now
[56:46] but there's harder way that brother
[56:48] branham trolls this is the exact
[56:51] same thing that happened abraham
[56:54] he took the steps of faith the harder
[56:56] way
[56:58] but it brought about the greater
[56:59] blessing now this is important because
[57:01] all of us when we come to church we hear
[57:03] the word
[57:05] and it may not be what we want to hear
[57:07] it may not be what we're praying for it
[57:10] may not be what we're interested in but
[57:12] i'm telling you god is giving us a step
[57:16] amen
[57:17] and if you make it as important to you
[57:19] as it is to god god will bless you for
[57:21] it
[57:26] we come to church we want a smorgasbord
[57:29] right we want to eat what we want to eat
[57:30] we want to leave what we
[57:34] but this isn't a catholic church
[57:36] we're not coming to get a slice
[57:39] we want all that god has for us
[57:43] now if you end up taking the easier way
[57:45] you're going to end up pitching your
[57:47] preaching towards the easier life now
[57:50] i'm not talking to the preachers when
[57:51] they make the statement but all of us
[57:54] preach
[57:56] all of us are preaching to somebody
[57:58] something what we think about the word
[58:01] amen
[58:03] and if you start pitching your tent
[58:05] towards the easier way you're going to
[58:07] actually start
[58:10] developing that same type of
[58:13] communication
[58:16] amen verse 12
[58:19] abraham
[58:20] dwelled
[58:21] in
[58:22] the place that god led him
[58:25] the land of canaan
[58:26] and lot dwelled
[58:28] in the place that his flesh led him
[58:32] the cities of the plain and pitched his
[58:36] tent
[58:37] toward
[58:38] sodom
[58:40] now he wasn't quite in the world yet
[58:43] but it eventually grew around him
[58:46] it consumed him
[58:49] it got so bad even his righteous soul
[58:51] was vexed
[58:53] every day the bible says amen
[58:56] because he chose the easier path
[58:59] amen he he he didn't take the step that
[59:03] god told him to take right
[59:05] so don't pitch your ideas
[59:08] towards the easier way
[59:10] don't pitch your life towards riches
[59:15] i mean
[59:17] riches are not cut out all that the
[59:19] devil makes him to be
[59:22] in luke chapter 18 verse 24 when jesus
[59:25] saw a man reject the offer to follow him
[59:28] he said how hardly shall the they that
[59:31] have riches enter into the kingdom
[59:34] right amen
[59:36] jesus says riches choke out the word of
[59:38] god in believers and that they actually
[59:41] become unfruitful
[59:43] one time they were fruitful and they
[59:44] become unfruitful
[59:46] first timothy 6 9 says but they that
[59:48] will be rich they that will be rich
[59:51] in a fall
[59:54] fall
[59:54] into temptation and a snare and into
[59:58] many foolish and hurtful lusts which
[1:00:00] drown men in destruction and perdition
[1:00:05] now we're looking spiritually for the
[1:00:07] love of money is the root of all evil i
[1:00:10] wonder what's going on in the world
[1:00:11] right now
[1:00:13] what's behind it the love of money
[1:00:16] somewhere the love of money
[1:00:20] which while some coveted after
[1:00:22] they have erred from the steps of faith
[1:00:25] and pierced themselves through with many
[1:00:28] sorrows
[1:00:30] we don't want to air from taking a step
[1:00:33] of faith amen genesis chapter 13 verse
[1:00:36] 13 genesis 13 verse 13 but when the men
[1:00:39] of sodom were but the men of sodom were
[1:00:42] wicked
[1:00:42] and sinners before the lord exceedingly
[1:00:45] and the lord
[1:00:46] said unto abram
[1:00:48] after notice i want you to catch this
[1:00:50] word after he spoke again to him after
[1:00:54] that lot was separated from him he said
[1:00:57] now lift up your eyes
[1:01:00] look from the place where thou art
[1:01:02] northward southward eastward
[1:01:04] the westward
[1:01:05] for all the land which thou see us to
[1:01:08] thee i will give it until thy seed
[1:01:09] forever
[1:01:11] and i will make thy seed as the dust of
[1:01:13] the earth so it cannot be numbered
[1:01:16] so if amen can number the dust of the
[1:01:19] earth then shall thy seed also be
[1:01:21] numbered
[1:01:22] now arise walk through the land in the
[1:01:25] length of it and the breath of it for i
[1:01:27] will give it on to thee
[1:01:30] i think god wants us to get up
[1:01:33] and look at the promises of god look at
[1:01:35] the nature of god and start walking in
[1:01:38] love start walking in joy start walking
[1:01:40] in peace
[1:01:41] start walking in gentleness claim it
[1:01:44] don't sit there and wait till god gives
[1:01:46] you walk in it
[1:01:51] wherever the souls of your feet that
[1:01:53] have i've given you right now i've given
[1:01:56] you it
[1:01:58] you've got to walk in it by faith
[1:02:00] walk in the nature of god walk into
[1:02:02] steaming others better than yourself
[1:02:04] walk walking helping others walking
[1:02:06] laying down your life more amen
[1:02:09] because this is where the greater
[1:02:11] blessings come amen
[1:02:15] sodom had grew right around lot
[1:02:19] and one of those arrows had pierced him
[1:02:22] from what i understand he became the
[1:02:24] mayor
[1:02:26] he just pitched toward at the beginning
[1:02:28] and he said you know this is not so bad
[1:02:30] i don't want to become the mayor of this
[1:02:32] place
[1:02:33] i'm i'm i'm pretty you know righteous
[1:02:36] and you know they'll look up to me and
[1:02:38] i'll make a great name for myself
[1:02:42] genesis 14 verse 11
[1:02:45] you know what happened there was a a war
[1:02:47] that took place
[1:02:49] it was like a world war there were many
[1:02:50] different
[1:02:51] kings
[1:02:52] that came together
[1:02:54] and it was
[1:02:55] kings on one side kings nations on the
[1:02:58] other side and they came together and
[1:03:00] they basically took over sodom
[1:03:05] and they took verse 11 genesis 14 and
[1:03:08] they took all the goods of sodom and
[1:03:10] gomorrh and the rituals and they went
[1:03:11] their way and they took a lot
[1:03:14] amen abraham's brother's son who dwelt
[1:03:17] in sodom and his goods and departed
[1:03:20] and there came one of them that escaped
[1:03:21] and told abraham
[1:03:23] abram the hebrew for he dwelt in the
[1:03:25] plain
[1:03:26] of marie verse 14 and when abram heard
[1:03:29] that his brother was taken captive he
[1:03:31] armed his trained servants born in his
[1:03:34] own house 318
[1:03:37] and pursued after them well that would
[1:03:38] have been a little drop in the bucket
[1:03:42] yes it would have been a little drop in
[1:03:44] the bucket compared to who he was going
[1:03:45] after
[1:03:47] and he divided himself against them he
[1:03:50] and his servants by night and smote them
[1:03:52] and
[1:03:53] pursued uh them onto
[1:03:55] uh hoba
[1:03:57] which is on the left hand of damascus
[1:04:00] and he brought back all the goods and
[1:04:02] also brought again his brother love and
[1:04:06] uh and his goods and the women also and
[1:04:09] the
[1:04:10] people isn't that beautiful
[1:04:14] abraham
[1:04:15] went after his fallen brother right amen
[1:04:19] amen
[1:04:20] a mate believer who decided to go and
[1:04:23] live part way in the world right
[1:04:25] but see
[1:04:27] lot meta lost the vision
[1:04:30] but abraham never lost the vision right
[1:04:34] he's still
[1:04:35] a godly spirit with a godly burden that
[1:04:39] cared
[1:04:41] now it isn't like at that point lot said
[1:04:44] you know what i'm done with this i want
[1:04:46] to get out of this sodom hey what
[1:04:48] happened
[1:04:51] but he still wanted to help him
[1:04:53] yes
[1:04:54] see the spirit of christ in abraham amen
[1:04:58] that's what we need
[1:05:00] amen that's what we long for
[1:05:03] we're not gonna he didn't change a lot
[1:05:07] you can't change lot
[1:05:09] it took 100 lots to make one abraham
[1:05:13] you can't change people right you can
[1:05:16] only present to them the world and if
[1:05:18] they eat it they take it they recognize
[1:05:20] i am a seed of god they will become the
[1:05:22] word of god amen
[1:05:25] too often we're trying to make something
[1:05:27] that you can't go in that garden and try
[1:05:29] to take any vegetable make it different
[1:05:31] than what it is you can't do it
[1:05:33] every seed will bring forth of its kind
[1:05:35] amen
[1:05:44] it's a step of faith that we want to
[1:05:46] take
[1:05:47] to help
[1:05:48] those that are falling around us
[1:05:52] it takes faith to do it
[1:05:54] i mean abraham only had three a little
[1:05:57] over 300 guys and he goes what's all
[1:05:59] these kings
[1:06:01] that's faith
[1:06:02] yes
[1:06:04] real faith you need faith to go help
[1:06:06] somebody yes amen you can't just say
[1:06:09] well i don't know what to say you know
[1:06:10] they're not gonna listen you know
[1:06:11] they're too big there's too many there's
[1:06:18] greater is he that's in us
[1:06:20] than he that's in the world
[1:06:23] but it's got to be real
[1:06:26] got to be real
[1:06:28] abraham
[1:06:30] was a predestinated seed of god
[1:06:33] he was elected he was a real believer
[1:06:35] he didn't stagger at the promises of god
[1:06:37] through unbelief
[1:06:39] and he was blessed beyond measure but
[1:06:43] because he obeyed the steps that god
[1:06:46] told him to take
[1:06:48] you know god is real simple he's not
[1:06:50] complex
[1:06:52] you don't got to try to figure him out
[1:06:54] you don't got to be some sort of a
[1:06:57] mathematician some scholar you you don't
[1:07:00] got to be a know-it-all you got to be i
[1:07:03] love you all
[1:07:05] so all you got to be is i love you i'm
[1:07:07] serious about this relationship and i'll
[1:07:09] tell you if you do that god will show
[1:07:11] you what to do
[1:07:16] but lot he was the type of the
[1:07:18] make-believer
[1:07:20] he believed in god
[1:07:23] but he didn't choose to walk all the way
[1:07:26] with god now this is important because
[1:07:28] everybody in every church is tempted by
[1:07:31] the devil to only walk part way with god
[1:07:35] i don't care how long we've been serving
[1:07:37] them
[1:07:37] the devil's constantly trying to say
[1:07:40] you've gone far enough you're okay
[1:07:44] only thing you need to do now is just
[1:07:45] grow in knowledge head knowledge
[1:07:48] you know what i'm saying
[1:07:51] nothing to do about
[1:07:53] that's not the right step of faith
[1:07:57] if i could say it like this lot was a
[1:08:00] part-time believer
[1:08:04] he was a half-way believer
[1:08:07] that's why i call him a mate believer
[1:08:10] he had convinced his family of an easier
[1:08:13] life and you know what they followed him
[1:08:16] they stayed with him
[1:08:18] think about what i'm saying
[1:08:21] without a vision the family will perish
[1:08:26] we need a vision amen we need a vision
[1:08:28] for our family we need a vision for our
[1:08:30] church we need a vision for those that
[1:08:32] are lost
[1:08:33] a vision god's vision
[1:08:36] the bible says that abram believed in
[1:08:38] the lord
[1:08:39] he believed in god's promise and was
[1:08:41] counted unto abram's faith for
[1:08:44] righteousness
[1:08:45] because he believed
[1:08:50] i i believe if
[1:08:52] if
[1:08:53] we went up to lot we said lot do you
[1:08:55] believe in god of course i do
[1:08:59] of course i believe i'm a believer i
[1:09:01] walked with abraham i prospered like he
[1:09:04] prospered
[1:09:08] but he didn't continue
[1:09:10] to believe on the new things that god
[1:09:11] told him to do
[1:09:13] he began to choose the easier way of
[1:09:15] living
[1:09:18] galatians chapter 3 verse 6 says even as
[1:09:20] abraham believed god and it was
[1:09:22] accounted him for righteousness
[1:09:24] know ye therefore that they which are of
[1:09:26] faith that's you and i
[1:09:28] the same are the children of abraham
[1:09:31] and the scripture foreseeing that god
[1:09:32] would justify the heathen through faith
[1:09:34] preached
[1:09:36] before the gospel unto abraham saying in
[1:09:39] thee
[1:09:40] shall all the nations be blessed
[1:09:42] so then they which are faith are blessed
[1:09:44] with faithful abraham
[1:09:47] we
[1:09:48] are our blessed people
[1:09:50] a peculiar people but we're a holy
[1:09:52] nation
[1:09:56] we are blessed of god
[1:09:58] the world may despise us
[1:10:00] but we've got a nature inside of us that
[1:10:03] keeps us happy when the bottom falls out
[1:10:05] amen amen
[1:10:09] we must remember that no matter how long
[1:10:12] we've been with god or accounted for us
[1:10:14] for righteousness the spiritual seed of
[1:10:16] god is promised
[1:10:19] to complete the nature change
[1:10:23] in other words we got to remember what
[1:10:25] the ultimate ultimate goal is it's not
[1:10:27] to be saved
[1:10:30] it's to become like christ
[1:10:32] it's to have the nature of christ it's
[1:10:34] to be able to lay down our life like
[1:10:36] christ laid down his life
[1:10:40] just because abraham was righteous he
[1:10:43] was not perfected yet
[1:10:45] right it's a very important statement
[1:10:47] it was years after abraham believed that
[1:10:50] god said unto him
[1:10:52] before it was accounted on his
[1:10:53] righteousness it was years after that
[1:10:55] that god said unto him i am the almighty
[1:10:58] god walk before me and be
[1:11:01] perfect
[1:11:04] be perfect
[1:11:08] now if you're doing everything that god
[1:11:10] has told you to do
[1:11:11] praise god
[1:11:13] amen
[1:11:15] if you're not start doing it amen
[1:11:19] and as soon as you do it be ready
[1:11:22] because he's going to be showing you
[1:11:23] something more
[1:11:24] that's the god we serve
[1:11:27] we serve that kind of god
[1:11:29] we do not serve a god that says all you
[1:11:31] have to do is repent be baptized and you
[1:11:33] know boom you go on with your life
[1:11:36] no god wants preeminence in her life he
[1:11:40] wants control of our life
[1:11:46] god did not want abraham to stop taking
[1:11:48] steps of faith
[1:11:51] he wanted abraham to continue taking
[1:11:55] steps until he manifested listen to this
[1:11:58] perfect love
[1:12:05] we could say well god knows everything
[1:12:06] he knows
[1:12:08] why does god put us through testing
[1:12:10] trials
[1:12:11] why did of the father of our faith
[1:12:14] went how many years number one without
[1:12:17] hearing from god i think the prophet
[1:12:18] said about 15.
[1:12:22] and then he had to wait around
[1:12:25] what is it 25 years for his son
[1:12:28] and then his son grew and got to that
[1:12:31] age and then he had
[1:12:34] this is the father of our faith right
[1:12:37] amen and we're supposed to walk in the
[1:12:39] same steps he did amen
[1:12:42] expect similar trials
[1:12:45] expect going through things that our
[1:12:48] father went through
[1:12:56] what type of believer
[1:12:58] today who is righteous
[1:13:00] but ought to be pressing
[1:13:02] onto perfection the nature change every
[1:13:05] believer needs to be pressing towards
[1:13:08] the nature change to where you can look
[1:13:11] at any time in the past week and say you
[1:13:13] know what i handle every situation
[1:13:15] just like jesus
[1:13:18] if we can't do that we need to be
[1:13:20] pressing amen not just saying well you
[1:13:22] know
[1:13:24] i'll never get there
[1:13:25] you know we all make mistakes
[1:13:27] with that how much are you going to try
[1:13:30] amen
[1:13:34] i say to the bride let us go to
[1:13:35] perfection
[1:13:37] jesus said
[1:13:38] be ye perfect even as my father in
[1:13:40] heaven is perfect i believe it's the
[1:13:42] desire of god this morning in this
[1:13:44] church that we move forward amen take
[1:13:46] take steps of faith towards perfection
[1:13:50] amen
[1:13:53] now when we're when we take these steps
[1:13:55] of faith what we're really doing
[1:13:57] is taking steps of obedience because
[1:13:59] it's not easy to have faith
[1:14:06] it's not i mean just look at every trial
[1:14:08] that we've been through
[1:14:10] and we're wanting god to move
[1:14:13] and god says i'm waiting to have faith
[1:14:14] first amen
[1:14:16] so faith is it's not easy
[1:14:19] but but god calls us to wait upon him
[1:14:22] amen they that wait upon the lord
[1:14:24] they'll renew their strength
[1:14:28] amen we don't walk
[1:14:30] by reasoning
[1:14:33] we cast it down
[1:14:36] we don't want by understanding
[1:14:38] we don't walk by sight we don't
[1:14:40] everything don't have to be perfect and
[1:14:43] the outside we just got to be connected
[1:14:45] with god
[1:14:46] connected with them
[1:14:50] look what happened to abraham when he
[1:14:52] leaned to his own understanding
[1:14:55] his own reasoning
[1:14:57] we all know the story
[1:15:00] a false
[1:15:01] seed came
[1:15:04] a hybrid seed
[1:15:07] even though abraham was a child of god
[1:15:10] the seed that came forth was not of
[1:15:13] god's will
[1:15:17] i'm speaking of ishmael i'm speaking of
[1:15:21] hagar
[1:15:22] and abraham are you with me
[1:15:25] do you believe that can you say amen
[1:15:27] don't make me stop because i got too
[1:15:29] much stuff and i don't want to be real
[1:15:30] alone today
[1:15:34] why wasn't
[1:15:37] it god's will because it was a natural
[1:15:39] seed it was a mixed seed
[1:15:43] it wasn't a spiritual seed of faith
[1:15:47] it was mixed with the idea with the
[1:15:50] lower thoughts of man
[1:15:57] now
[1:15:58] no matter how much abraham loved him
[1:16:01] because he loved him he said all that
[1:16:02] ishmael may live
[1:16:04] that he may be the one
[1:16:06] he had to separate from him
[1:16:10] this is important
[1:16:13] because it wasn't god to start with if
[1:16:15] you just follow it through
[1:16:18] he had to separate from them
[1:16:21] we don't got time to go i'll tell you
[1:16:22] when i looked at the start of these
[1:16:24] steps of faith i thought we could take a
[1:16:25] month and just go through all the steps
[1:16:27] of abraham
[1:16:28] there was a lot of them
[1:16:30] even though we are children of god when
[1:16:32] we mix our own reasoning with the word
[1:16:35] our lives will become a hybrid
[1:16:37] hybrid christianity hybrid message
[1:16:40] believer hybrid nature of god amen
[1:16:43] instead of a real believer
[1:16:49] no matter how much our flesh enjoys
[1:16:51] compromising we need to separate from
[1:16:54] all unbelief
[1:16:57] this is a perfect type of the believer
[1:16:59] who starts out in the spirit but he
[1:17:00] tries to perfect himself in the flesh
[1:17:03] and if we had time we could go in the
[1:17:04] book of galatians that's what happened
[1:17:06] to them they started in the spirit and
[1:17:08] they wanted to try to get perfected with
[1:17:10] all themselves without god being in
[1:17:12] control
[1:17:15] and we're very tempted to do that
[1:17:16] because you know it's easier to read the
[1:17:18] bible than it is to pray
[1:17:23] it's easier to sit in the prayer room
[1:17:25] say your prayers than it is to labor to
[1:17:27] get into the spirit
[1:17:31] it's easier to do the do's and don'ts to
[1:17:33] try to say you know
[1:17:34] i'm perfected than just pressing into it
[1:17:39] galatians chapter 4 verse 28 now we
[1:17:41] brethren as isaac was are the children
[1:17:44] of promise
[1:17:47] but as then
[1:17:48] he that was born after the flesh
[1:17:51] what did he do
[1:17:53] persecuted him that was born after the
[1:17:55] spirit yes amen and notice even so
[1:17:59] it is now
[1:18:01] that's right
[1:18:02] if you notice the carnal believers will
[1:18:04] always persecute the spiritual believers
[1:18:08] but not the other way around amen
[1:18:11] so if you're a true believer
[1:18:13] be careful
[1:18:15] what you say about others
[1:18:18] nevertheless what saith the scripture
[1:18:20] cast out the bondwoman a and her son for
[1:18:24] the son of the bondwoman shall not be
[1:18:27] heir with the son of the free woman
[1:18:30] so then brethren we
[1:18:32] are not
[1:18:33] children of the bondwoman
[1:18:35] but of the free amen
[1:18:43] if you take the word from cover to cover
[1:18:46] this message from cover to cover you're
[1:18:48] walking in all the truth that god has
[1:18:51] given you that to me is the evidence of
[1:18:54] you are a seed of abraham amen
[1:18:58] but you begin to dissect and pick and
[1:19:01] choose and lay this aside all you're
[1:19:03] doing is show me your children of the
[1:19:05] bondwoman
[1:19:08] there's got to be some sort of scripture
[1:19:10] to tell me where i stand
[1:19:12] if i really want to know who i am how to
[1:19:14] get to heaven there's got to be
[1:19:15] something to tell me
[1:19:20] a carnal believer
[1:19:22] will be blessed naturally
[1:19:25] as long as he follows instructions he
[1:19:27] will be
[1:19:29] there's a prosperity message
[1:19:32] that some believers really gravitate to
[1:19:35] that they can benefit from naturally
[1:19:38] like if you do this you know god's gonna
[1:19:40] bless you
[1:19:43] but you can't compare those blessings
[1:19:47] with the blessings that you get from
[1:19:48] being a spiritual believer
[1:19:52] it goes way beyond the natural amen
[1:19:57] to where god comes inside
[1:19:59] and he's in control
[1:20:02] and you know it and you rest in peace
[1:20:07] you got to go all the way with god
[1:20:10] ishmael is a good example of this god
[1:20:12] told abraham in genesis chapter 21 verse
[1:20:16] 13. he said and also
[1:20:20] of the son of the bondwoman will i make
[1:20:23] a nation
[1:20:25] because he is thy seed yes naturally
[1:20:33] he's the seed of abraham naturally
[1:20:38] after hagar and her son ishmael were
[1:20:41] kicked out and they went to the
[1:20:42] wilderness
[1:20:43] they felt doomed they were at a place
[1:20:45] where i didn't know what was going to
[1:20:47] happen
[1:20:49] i mean it it looked like ishmael was
[1:20:51] going to die and and hagar was pleading
[1:20:54] out to god and in genesis 21 verse 17
[1:20:57] and the angel of god called
[1:20:59] hagar out of heaven and said unto her
[1:21:01] what a with thee hagar
[1:21:05] fear not
[1:21:06] for god
[1:21:07] have heard the voice of the lad where he
[1:21:10] is
[1:21:11] arise
[1:21:13] lift up the lad and hold him in thy hand
[1:21:17] for i will make him a great nation amen
[1:21:23] just like he told abraham
[1:21:27] for isaac
[1:21:31] verse 20 and god was with the lad and he
[1:21:35] grew
[1:21:36] and dwelt in the wilderness and he
[1:21:38] became an archer
[1:21:41] so god was with them
[1:21:43] and out of ishmael there came a great
[1:21:45] nation
[1:21:47] but it was a carnal nation
[1:21:49] lots of money
[1:21:51] lots of oil
[1:21:52] lots of riches
[1:21:54] but they were always fighting
[1:21:58] handling situations with anger strife
[1:22:01] confusion
[1:22:04] there's never been peace with them not
[1:22:07] even to this day
[1:22:10] they just don't know how to love
[1:22:12] because they're of a natural seed
[1:22:17] god still blessed them
[1:22:18] but the blessing was natural
[1:22:20] amen i'll tell you saints of god we
[1:22:22] don't want just the natural blessings of
[1:22:24] god we're here today for the spiritual
[1:22:26] blessings of god
[1:22:28] amen amen you got to keep focus on that
[1:22:32] genesis 25 16
[1:22:35] he said these are the sons of ishmael
[1:22:37] and these are their names by their towns
[1:22:40] by their castles
[1:22:42] twelve princes
[1:22:44] according
[1:22:46] to their nations yes they are nations
[1:22:50] god made the he told hagar a promise and
[1:22:54] he kept his promise they became a great
[1:22:57] nation
[1:23:00] notice 12 patriarchs spiritual
[1:23:06] 12 princes amen carnal
[1:23:11] to this day
[1:23:12] they are the seed of abraham
[1:23:14] but it's the carnal seed of abraham
[1:23:18] and when that seed met up with jesus
[1:23:20] when he walked the earth
[1:23:23] that same seed persecuted jesus
[1:23:26] wanted to kill him
[1:23:30] well we're of our father abraham
[1:23:32] i know you are but if you were of that
[1:23:35] spiritual seed you wouldn't seek to kill
[1:23:37] me
[1:23:39] you wouldn't seek that
[1:23:41] so it just shows you're of the natural
[1:23:43] seed
[1:23:44] and he went on to say
[1:23:46] of the devil
[1:23:49] think about it
[1:23:50] we're interested
[1:23:52] in the word of god amen
[1:23:54] we're interested in obeying god's voice
[1:23:57] we're interested in making sure that i'm
[1:24:00] holding myself accountable to my brother
[1:24:02] my sister
[1:24:06] you know you can go all you want and say
[1:24:08] well it's none of your business it's
[1:24:10] between me and god that's fine you can
[1:24:12] do that
[1:24:14] but i need all the help i can get
[1:24:21] when it comes to christianity or this
[1:24:23] message
[1:24:24] it's no different brother brandon said
[1:24:25] there's always twins
[1:24:28] twin believers
[1:24:31] god will bless you if you only go part
[1:24:34] way with him and we see that in ishmael
[1:24:38] if you only take part of his word it
[1:24:40] doesn't mean god's not going to bless
[1:24:42] you he may bless you but if you take all
[1:24:44] the word you will be blessed beyond
[1:24:46] measure
[1:24:48] you won't be able to measure it amen
[1:24:51] because it goes much deeper than the
[1:24:53] outside amendment
[1:24:56] only the true seed of god will take
[1:24:58] all of god's word with them
[1:25:01] only the true seed
[1:25:03] because it's when you take god's word
[1:25:06] you're going to suffer
[1:25:08] and nobody likes to suffer it's not it's
[1:25:10] not
[1:25:11] the broad way
[1:25:13] i mean look at every everybody this
[1:25:15] whole world is going down the broadway
[1:25:17] like a
[1:25:19] running
[1:25:20] running for it
[1:25:23] it takes faith to walk each step higher
[1:25:26] with the word
[1:25:28] amen
[1:25:30] that's what we're supposed to be doing
[1:25:31] until we become
[1:25:33] manifested the whole world amen
[1:25:36] genesis chapter 22 verse 1.
[1:25:39] are you getting something out of this
[1:25:44] excuse me
[1:25:47] genesis chapter 2 verse 1. see i'm
[1:25:50] always
[1:25:51] once in a while i should say i'm waiting
[1:25:53] for those pages to turn
[1:25:55] but you know
[1:25:56] we got this up here and
[1:25:58] pages don't turn and i don't got no time
[1:26:00] to sit in my water
[1:26:06] genesis chapter 22 verse 1.
[1:26:09] this is what happened later later on
[1:26:10] abraham's life it came to pass that
[1:26:13] after these things that god did
[1:26:16] tempt i'll say it like this test
[1:26:19] abraham because god don't tempt anybody
[1:26:21] but he tested abraham
[1:26:24] many many many years
[1:26:25] and said unto abraham
[1:26:28] and he said unto him abraham and he said
[1:26:31] behold i am here the best thing to do
[1:26:34] when god gets your attention
[1:26:36] say i'm here
[1:26:38] i'm paying attention i'm listening amen
[1:26:43] and he said take now thy son
[1:26:46] thine only son isaac whom thou lovest
[1:26:50] and get thee into the land of mora
[1:26:53] and offer him there for a burnt offering
[1:26:56] upon one of the mountains which i will
[1:26:58] tell thee of
[1:27:02] and abraham rose up early in the morning
[1:27:04] and saddled his ass
[1:27:06] and took of his young
[1:27:08] men with him and isaac his son
[1:27:10] enclaved the wood of the burnt offerings
[1:27:12] and rose up and went unto the place of
[1:27:14] which uh of which god had told him
[1:27:18] then on the third day abraham
[1:27:20] lifted up his eyes and saw the place
[1:27:22] afar off
[1:27:24] and abraham said unto these young men
[1:27:26] i want you to abide here
[1:27:29] with the asses
[1:27:30] and i in the land will go yonder
[1:27:33] and and worship
[1:27:35] and come again
[1:27:37] to you
[1:27:41] now you have to it has to be real
[1:27:43] between you and god for this to happen
[1:27:46] it has to be real
[1:27:48] it can't be just a pretense it can't be
[1:27:50] just coming to church it can't even just
[1:27:52] be paying ties and offerings
[1:27:55] it has to be a real relationship
[1:28:00] this is think about you think after
[1:28:02] abraham had to wait 25 years for the son
[1:28:06] waiting waiting waiting waiting waiting
[1:28:08] waiting waiting waiting brother brandon
[1:28:10] say to sarah do you feel anything yet
[1:28:13] not a thing
[1:28:14] well keep knitting those booties because
[1:28:16] he's coming
[1:28:22] and here
[1:28:23] had to he went through the trial of that
[1:28:26] long trial
[1:28:29] thought about is uh the only one that he
[1:28:32] had in his house was a servant
[1:28:34] god said no
[1:28:36] it's going to come through your loins
[1:28:39] and then that trial with hagar
[1:28:43] that was a fiasco
[1:28:47] and finally isaac comes and he
[1:28:50] surrenders this is the one
[1:28:55] circumcised them
[1:28:59] grew up they began to bond this is the
[1:29:02] one that's going to bring forth
[1:29:04] the father of many children and through
[1:29:07] him was going to come and now god was
[1:29:09] approaching him and saying
[1:29:12] give him back to me
[1:29:18] now we know the end of the story but he
[1:29:20] didn't
[1:29:22] a lot of times we go through tests and
[1:29:24] trials
[1:29:26] we don't know the end of the story
[1:29:28] what do we have to have when we don't
[1:29:30] know the end of the story we need to
[1:29:32] have faith
[1:29:33] and it's hard to get to that step of
[1:29:35] faith if you want to ignore all the
[1:29:36] other ones the past 30 years
[1:29:41] steps of faith are important
[1:29:43] what he went through was important
[1:29:46] before david got goliath he took that
[1:29:48] bear he took that lion
[1:29:50] amen we need to walk the steps of faith
[1:29:53] don't belittle what you're going through
[1:29:55] god's god's doing something
[1:29:57] amen god's taking us through
[1:30:00] he wants to see a nature change
[1:30:04] let's say you got everything that you
[1:30:06] could possibly want in life what would
[1:30:08] be next
[1:30:10] more of god
[1:30:11] right
[1:30:13] more of god let's just bypass the world
[1:30:16] and just to go after god
[1:30:20] more time going after god
[1:30:26] it'll be worth it all
[1:30:29] it'll be worth it all
[1:30:32] abraham had faith
[1:30:36] he didn't have feeling didn't emotion he
[1:30:38] didn't even tell everybody
[1:30:42] uh
[1:30:43] didn't didn't he
[1:30:46] the way that he expressed he was going
[1:30:47] up making some offerings even tell the
[1:30:49] family you know didn't even tell
[1:30:51] home before he left i don't know where
[1:30:54] that scripture is right now so i can't
[1:30:56] quote it
[1:30:56] but it's like you're just gonna go up
[1:30:59] make sacrifices
[1:31:02] but inside of him
[1:31:04] he knew he had that relationship with
[1:31:06] god it was so real what god was telling
[1:31:08] him to do and it wasn't easy this is
[1:31:11] what i'm trying to say when god speaks
[1:31:13] to us don't expect it to be real easy
[1:31:15] but you obey the word
[1:31:18] it's so important to obey it
[1:31:20] don't let it go
[1:31:24] and notice he went the lad they were
[1:31:26] going to go yonder what they're going to
[1:31:27] do
[1:31:28] boohoo and cry about what they were
[1:31:29] going through no way worship
[1:31:32] amen and when we're done we're coming
[1:31:34] back
[1:31:36] and abraham took the wood and the burnt
[1:31:37] offerings and laid it upon isaac his son
[1:31:40] and he took the fire
[1:31:42] in his hand in the knife and they went
[1:31:44] both of them together right
[1:31:47] isaac didn't know what was going on here
[1:31:51] isaac spake unto abraham his father and
[1:31:53] said
[1:31:54] my father
[1:31:57] and he said
[1:31:58] here am i
[1:31:59] my son
[1:32:01] and he said behold the fire the wood
[1:32:05] but where is the lamb for the burnt
[1:32:07] offering
[1:32:11] what a comfort
[1:32:13] father abraham said to a son my son
[1:32:16] god will provide himself a lamb
[1:32:19] for a burnt offering
[1:32:23] so they both
[1:32:24] so they went both i'm sorry they went
[1:32:28] both of them together
[1:32:31] it really didn't look like abraham was
[1:32:33] doubting or questioning or murmuring or
[1:32:36] or dies acting does it
[1:32:38] i think the scripture tells us he
[1:32:39] staggered not at the promises of god
[1:32:41] through unbelief he was strong in faith
[1:32:44] giving praise
[1:32:46] worship
[1:32:47] you know when you know you're in god's
[1:32:49] will just worship yes amen worship
[1:32:54] what happened to david when he knew his
[1:32:56] son wasn't coming back he worshipped
[1:32:59] he would have changed it if he could
[1:33:02] but he couldn't
[1:33:04] so he knew he was in god's will what did
[1:33:06] he do worship amen just worship god he
[1:33:09] inhabits the praises of his people amen
[1:33:13] these steps of faith are not easy that's
[1:33:15] true
[1:33:18] verse 9 they came to the place where god
[1:33:20] had told them of and abraham built an
[1:33:22] altar there and laid the wooden
[1:33:25] and bound isaac his son and laid him on
[1:33:28] the altar upon the wood
[1:33:31] so i don't know it doesn't really tell
[1:33:33] you know what happened at this point but
[1:33:38] i'm sure
[1:33:39] it was getting intense
[1:33:41] and abraham stretched forth his hand and
[1:33:43] took the knife to slay his son and the
[1:33:46] angel of the lord called unto him out of
[1:33:49] heaven and said abraham abraham
[1:33:52] and he said here am i amen
[1:33:55] and he said lay not thine hand upon the
[1:33:58] lad
[1:34:00] neither do thou anything unto him for
[1:34:02] now i know that thou fearest god
[1:34:07] for now i know you mean you didn't know
[1:34:08] before
[1:34:14] god
[1:34:15] isn't going to know until we obey him
[1:34:20] god will not accept the knowing until we
[1:34:23] obey him
[1:34:24] he knows everything
[1:34:27] but he's not going to accept it
[1:34:33] now i know that thou fearest god seeing
[1:34:35] thou as not withheld thy son thy only
[1:34:37] son for me and abraham lifted up his
[1:34:38] eyes and looked and behold there was a
[1:34:40] ram caught in the thicket by the horns
[1:34:41] and abraham went and took the ram and
[1:34:43] offered him up for a burnt offering in
[1:34:45] the stead of his son and abraham called
[1:34:47] the place jehovah jair god will provide
[1:34:50] yes
[1:34:51] god will provide whatever you need is
[1:34:52] god will provide amen
[1:34:54] as it is said today in the mountain of
[1:34:56] the lord it is it shall be seen and the
[1:34:59] angel of the lord called unto abraham
[1:35:00] out of heaven the second time
[1:35:04] this is after he obeyed
[1:35:06] and he said by myself there is nobody
[1:35:09] greater i have sworn saith the lord for
[1:35:12] because thou has done this thing
[1:35:16] because you obeyed me
[1:35:18] that's right
[1:35:19] and has not withheld thy son thine only
[1:35:21] son
[1:35:23] that in blessing i'm going to bless you
[1:35:26] and in multiplying i'm going to multiply
[1:35:29] you thy seed as the stars of the heaven
[1:35:31] as the sandwiches upon the seashore and
[1:35:33] thy seed shall possess the gates of the
[1:35:36] enemy
[1:35:38] who's our enemy
[1:35:43] certainly satan is but who else is irony
[1:35:45] our neighbor well wait a minute just i'm
[1:35:47] my wife my husband well wait a minute
[1:35:48] who's our enemy brother said our
[1:35:50] greatest memory is our self
[1:35:53] now if we just let our flesh do what it
[1:35:55] wants
[1:35:57] it always gets us in trouble doesn't it
[1:35:59] amen so we've got to possess the gates
[1:36:02] of the enemy
[1:36:04] the promise is for us
[1:36:06] that we can have such a holy ghost
[1:36:08] inside of us that it will possess those
[1:36:10] gates it will control our tongue it will
[1:36:13] control our thoughts it'll control our
[1:36:15] affection it'll control everything about
[1:36:18] us because the spiritual the seed the
[1:36:21] true seed of abraham is the spiritual
[1:36:23] seed of idol god that was not a promise
[1:36:26] to ishmael
[1:36:28] it wasn't it was a promise to isaac
[1:36:37] and in thy
[1:36:38] seed
[1:36:40] shall all the nations of the earth be
[1:36:42] blessed because thou has obeyed my voice
[1:36:47] god naturally blessed ishmael greatly
[1:36:52] but he blessed isaac beyond measure
[1:36:55] beyond measure
[1:36:58] so i'll tell you today what what what
[1:37:00] blessings do you want
[1:37:03] do you want the now blessings
[1:37:06] you want the ones that right now
[1:37:09] bless me naturally
[1:37:11] or do you want the ones that's going to
[1:37:13] take you through
[1:37:18] it's through if we just watch these
[1:37:21] steps of abraham
[1:37:25] god told him what to do he said here's
[1:37:27] the next step you take
[1:37:31] by faith you have to take that step yes
[1:37:34] got to offer them up i'll offer them up
[1:37:38] through that obedience
[1:37:40] yes
[1:37:41] god will bless you amen
[1:37:45] now i know you fierce me
[1:37:47] because you've done this thing i'm going
[1:37:49] to bless you
[1:37:50] greatly with blessing i'm going to bless
[1:37:52] you how's that happen brother john well
[1:37:54] wednesday we heard we really received a
[1:37:56] blessing from god wednesday what did any
[1:37:58] time god gives us his word
[1:38:02] it's a blessing
[1:38:04] so he gave us his word about tithes and
[1:38:06] offerings now that's a blessing
[1:38:07] spiritually not not physically not
[1:38:10] naturally
[1:38:12] but spiritually it's a blessing
[1:38:15] now when you take that blessing and you
[1:38:17] obey it then he multiplies it
[1:38:20] in blessing i will bless you it's
[1:38:22] through obedience to that that god
[1:38:24] really pours out his blessings
[1:38:28] so i i want i want
[1:38:32] i want to get to a place where god just
[1:38:34] overfills me with spiritual blessings
[1:38:40] in blessing i will bless thee
[1:38:43] god is a blesser
[1:38:46] he wants to bless his people
[1:38:49] he even blesses his enemies
[1:38:51] he's going to bless his enemies i can
[1:38:52] expect him to bless me
[1:38:55] the word blessing
[1:38:57] is often noted as god's favor or
[1:38:59] protection brother did say it one time
[1:39:01] he said the greatest thing he could say
[1:39:02] to somebody is god bless you
[1:39:05] some people don't understand that and
[1:39:07] they use the word in so many different
[1:39:09] faucet facets it's almost like a
[1:39:11] greeting god bless you god bless you
[1:39:14] sometimes people feel like they got
[1:39:17] something
[1:39:18] in their flesh yes god bless you
[1:39:23] or oh yeah god has really blessed me
[1:39:26] but when we say god bless you what we're
[1:39:29] doing is we're invoking god we're
[1:39:31] calling on god to god bless this person
[1:39:35] and that's the way we need to think
[1:39:37] about it when we say it that we're
[1:39:39] really invoking god to bless this person
[1:39:42] and when you do that that is the
[1:39:43] greatest thing you can say and anything
[1:39:45] short of that is short
[1:39:48] of the greatest thing you can say
[1:39:53] we
[1:39:54] hear a lot about
[1:39:56] the
[1:39:57] the blessings and the beatitudes
[1:39:59] where jesus said blessed are the poor
[1:40:01] blessed are the me blessed are the
[1:40:02] merciful
[1:40:04] but in order to get that blessing you
[1:40:06] have to step out by faith and do
[1:40:09] something
[1:40:11] right
[1:40:14] blessed are the merciful for they shall
[1:40:16] obtain mercy
[1:40:18] so you want mercy
[1:40:20] you got to learn to be merciful now at
[1:40:21] one time
[1:40:23] we
[1:40:24] didn't do anything to deserve god's
[1:40:26] mercy
[1:40:28] right we were all in sin and he came and
[1:40:30] he was merciful to us
[1:40:32] but after a while he expects us to be
[1:40:36] able to forgive others if we're going to
[1:40:38] get god's forgiveness
[1:40:41] so when we want the blessings of god
[1:40:43] we've got to go through we've got to by
[1:40:45] faith
[1:40:46] do the harder thing this is what i'm
[1:40:48] trying to tell you we don't we don't
[1:40:50] believe in a prosperity message where
[1:40:51] you do nothing and get everything
[1:40:58] we don't
[1:41:00] it's not scriptural
[1:41:02] to me
[1:41:03] the fact
[1:41:07] that you have to be merciful to others
[1:41:08] and forgive others
[1:41:11] shows you have to work
[1:41:14] you don't work you don't eat
[1:41:17] you have a part to play
[1:41:19] for the blessings of god in blessing i
[1:41:21] will bless thee
[1:41:25] we can't continue to expect blessings
[1:41:28] without doing what the lord wants us to
[1:41:29] do amen
[1:41:31] now i'm just about done can you hold out
[1:41:33] a little bit
[1:41:35] if you can't say
[1:41:37] step down brother john
[1:41:42] we all want a closer walk with god
[1:41:48] we want to find more favor more
[1:41:49] protection more blessings
[1:41:53] don't you want a higher walk
[1:41:57] we have to follow the steps of abraham
[1:42:00] the ones he took amen
[1:42:03] each step of faith
[1:42:06] leads us to become
[1:42:08] obedient and
[1:42:10] in
[1:42:11] doing more what god has asked us to do
[1:42:14] if you live another
[1:42:16] year
[1:42:16] believe me god's going to expect more
[1:42:18] out of you in that year than he does
[1:42:20] today
[1:42:23] what do we do take it down to if you
[1:42:24] live another month he's going to expect
[1:42:26] more
[1:42:28] i'm just saying get your mind made up of
[1:42:30] growing
[1:42:32] acts chapter 20 verse 33
[1:42:39] i want to show you how you can be
[1:42:40] blessed more that's what i want to show
[1:42:42] you
[1:42:43] this is kind of like the
[1:42:45] the saving the best for last type of
[1:42:46] thing you know what i'm saying
[1:42:49] acts chapter 20 verse 33 i have coveted
[1:42:52] no man's silver or gold or apparel i
[1:42:57] haven't asked for anybody's tie
[1:43:01] and it's for their silver or their gold
[1:43:04] paul is speaking here
[1:43:07] ye
[1:43:09] yourselves know that these hands
[1:43:12] have ministered
[1:43:13] unto my necessities
[1:43:16] and not only to my necessities
[1:43:18] but to them that were with me
[1:43:22] and i have showed you all things
[1:43:25] how that soul laboring you ought to
[1:43:28] support the weak
[1:43:30] and to remember the words
[1:43:32] of our lord jesus
[1:43:35] how he said it is more blessed to give
[1:43:38] than to receive
[1:43:42] abraham was blessed to receive isaac
[1:43:46] but he was more blessed when he gave
[1:43:48] isaac back to god
[1:43:52] but it was a greater sacrifice
[1:43:54] amen we're blessed when we receive
[1:43:56] things
[1:43:58] homie was blessed at christmas
[1:44:02] and i'll tell you you didn't act like
[1:44:03] that when you were getting your presents
[1:44:05] so i can tell you
[1:44:09] who wouldn't be thrilled to get a 500
[1:44:11] gift card from amazon in here
[1:44:15] we'd all be excited
[1:44:19] our our our mind we would be thinking
[1:44:21] about what we're going to do with it our
[1:44:22] lips would be talking about uh showing a
[1:44:26] thankfulness and appreciation to the
[1:44:28] person who gave it to us because we
[1:44:30] receive something we and and we can do
[1:44:32] something with what was given to us we
[1:44:34] would be blessed and we would be
[1:44:36] appreciative about it to a degree right
[1:44:40] but what's more blessed than that
[1:44:46] we don't realize we would be more
[1:44:48] blessed if you gave up your time
[1:44:51] you work extra hours you sacrificed
[1:44:56] and you got a gift card
[1:44:58] and you gave it to somebody
[1:45:03] now you would be more blessed
[1:45:05] don't seem like it to the flesh
[1:45:10] it's more blessed to give than to
[1:45:12] receive
[1:45:18] receiving a gift is easy
[1:45:20] to give one is much harder
[1:45:23] it's why people turn down the greater
[1:45:25] blessing
[1:45:27] because it's harder to give
[1:45:31] we don't want to give out of abundance
[1:45:34] no sacrifice there
[1:45:36] look at the little woman the widow
[1:45:39] the widow woman
[1:45:40] in church they took up an offering
[1:45:44] she gave more than everybody
[1:45:46] because she gave all
[1:45:48] i believe she was more blessed than all
[1:45:51] are you with me
[1:45:52] we need to start taking these steps of
[1:45:55] faith
[1:45:57] don't ask what this church can do for
[1:45:59] you
[1:46:00] rather ask yourself what should you be
[1:46:02] doing for the church
[1:46:04] it's more blessed to give than to
[1:46:06] receive
[1:46:09] romans chapter four verse one real quick
[1:46:12] this is uh romans chapter 4 verse 1
[1:46:15] through 3 and what shall we say then
[1:46:18] that abraham our faith as pertaining to
[1:46:20] the flesh have found for if abraham were
[1:46:23] justified by works he would have to
[1:46:26] glory but not before god for what saith
[1:46:28] the scripture abraham believed god has
[1:46:30] accounted unto him for righteousness so
[1:46:32] these scriptures are telling us here
[1:46:34] that abraham was not justified by works
[1:46:40] and he wasn't
[1:46:42] but this is what i want to say to make
[1:46:44] it real clear
[1:46:46] you can have works without faith
[1:46:51] but it is impossible to have
[1:46:56] faith without works
[1:47:05] james chapter
[1:47:07] of james chapter 2 verse 20.
[1:47:11] remember that statement
[1:47:13] if you want to get an understanding
[1:47:15] of the proper order
[1:47:17] of of works and faith faith comes first
[1:47:20] then you work
[1:47:23] now tell you what you can't have faith
[1:47:26] and be justified before god
[1:47:29] until you do the works
[1:47:31] he'll give you so much time
[1:47:35] verse 20 but will thou
[1:47:37] o vain man will thou know o vain man
[1:47:40] that faith
[1:47:42] without works
[1:47:43] is dead
[1:47:46] was not abraham our father justified by
[1:47:48] works when when when at the beginning no
[1:47:51] he believed at the beginning it was
[1:47:54] accounted unto him for righteousness at
[1:47:55] the beginning
[1:47:57] but he was justified by the works that
[1:48:00] god expected him to do afterwards when
[1:48:02] he offered isaac his son upon the altar
[1:48:06] amen
[1:48:08] seeing thou how faith had wrought his
[1:48:10] work faith brought about the works
[1:48:13] and by works
[1:48:14] was faith made perfect
[1:48:18] hallelujah
[1:48:19] amen
[1:48:21] there are steps of faith god is leading
[1:48:23] us to perfection
[1:48:25] to a perfect faith to meet a rapture
[1:48:29] we need perfect faith to make the
[1:48:31] rapture
[1:48:33] brother brandon says it lies in the
[1:48:34] tapes
[1:48:37] we need to spend more time hunting for
[1:48:39] it
[1:48:40] come on
[1:48:42] we got to start taking these steps if
[1:48:44] we're gonna make if we're gonna have
[1:48:46] faith for the rapture door
[1:48:48] it's it's no longer i know it's true
[1:48:52] i i believe it's for me
[1:48:56] but god's gonna find out because the
[1:48:59] whole though i'm telling you you don't
[1:49:01] have to be the message there's people
[1:49:02] that believe in the rapture
[1:49:04] amen
[1:49:06] it's not just saying i believe in the
[1:49:07] rapture
[1:49:09] we can't do that we got to follow the
[1:49:11] steps amen what is god expecting me to
[1:49:14] do amen
[1:49:18] all i'm trying to do is provoke you
[1:49:21] just start walking up with god
[1:49:30] we've been called to something the bride
[1:49:32] has been called to something greater
[1:49:36] than the lukewarm believer amen
[1:49:39] it's a different message to her
[1:49:42] it's a higher myth stand with me
[1:49:47] do you know the bible says that
[1:49:50] we are blessed when we read the word
[1:49:54] the bible says that we're blessed when
[1:49:55] we hear the word
[1:49:56] that's right
[1:49:57] but did you know the bible says that
[1:49:59] we're more blessed when we obey the word
[1:50:02] yes amen
[1:50:04] remember when they came to
[1:50:07] jesus this woman these i guess those
[1:50:09] women said blessed is the woman
[1:50:11] that took care of you when you were a
[1:50:13] baby
[1:50:15] and jesus said yea rather blessed are
[1:50:18] they that hear the word and keep it
[1:50:21] keep it
[1:50:24] abraham kept the word
[1:50:28] god didn't allow him to kill isaac but
[1:50:30] he kept the word amen
[1:50:32] and that's what made his faith perfect
[1:50:34] is following through with what he said
[1:50:36] he believed
[1:50:38] god's gonna try us we're gonna we're
[1:50:40] gonna be more tried than what we are
[1:50:41] have been going through
[1:50:43] it's gonna get worse
[1:50:46] but god ain't gonna let anything happen
[1:50:48] to us hallelujah
[1:50:50] he's not
[1:50:52] he's going to take care of us but it's
[1:50:55] so important that when we come to church
[1:50:56] and we hear the word of god
[1:50:59] walk in it
[1:51:00] follow it
[1:51:02] go home and say lord help me to do this
[1:51:03] word
[1:51:05] don't come with the picky choosy thing
[1:51:08] get rid of that come with the
[1:51:09] seriousness with god amen that that
[1:51:11] you're serious about walking the steps
[1:51:14] of faith like abraham did
[1:51:16] amen
[1:51:18] let's bow our hearts in a word of prayer
[1:51:20] look to him and
[1:51:21] this time
[1:51:25] every head bowed
[1:51:27] maybe my wife could just play a little
[1:51:32] little something
[1:51:37] don't you just look at
[1:51:39] yourself for just a moment
[1:51:47] ask yourself this question are you
[1:51:50] walking
[1:51:52] faithfully
[1:51:54] in those steps of your father abraham
[1:52:03] have we skipped any have we set any
[1:52:05] aside
[1:52:07] have you ignored some
[1:52:11] have you tried to make it
[1:52:13] without taking the next step
[1:52:21] even though we're here together as a
[1:52:22] family god deals with us as individuals
[1:52:27] this is between you and the lord
[1:52:30] it may not be a popular message i see
[1:52:33] perhaps most of mine or not
[1:52:37] but i believe it's god's message
[1:52:39] i believe it's the truth
[1:52:41] i believe god is calling us higher
[1:52:50] i want you to resolve in your heart your
[1:52:52] relationship with the lord these steps
[1:52:54] the days to come the preaching that you
[1:52:56] were here
[1:52:58] the tapes you'll listen to
[1:53:00] when god speaks to you
[1:53:04] just say yes lord i'll walk in it i want
[1:53:06] to prove my faith to you
[1:53:09] i believe with all your heart now as we
[1:53:11] go to him in prayer our heavenly father
[1:53:17] we need you
[1:53:19] we need you
[1:53:22] when we look at abraham in the
[1:53:24] years that he
[1:53:27] seemed like his whole life was one trial
[1:53:29] after another
[1:53:30] one long trial
[1:53:32] gone through so many things
[1:53:36] the lord
[1:53:37] you made him the father of our faith
[1:53:46] lord i know that you're calling us to
[1:53:48] take those same steps
[1:53:51] here lord we're all indifferent realms
[1:53:54] of the ladder different areas of our
[1:53:56] walk with you
[1:53:57] and it doesn't matter
[1:54:00] so much where we're at as long as we're
[1:54:02] we're following through
[1:54:04] what you've asked us to do and just pray
[1:54:07] for every heart here lord everyone that
[1:54:10] has heard this word today
[1:54:13] [Music]
