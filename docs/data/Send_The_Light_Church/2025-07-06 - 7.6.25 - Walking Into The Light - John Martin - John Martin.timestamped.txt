[36:42] He's He's just, you know, he's just
[36:44] rejoicing in the only way he knows how.
[36:49] Amen. We're certainly thankful that God
[36:52] has kept his hand upon brother Ferguson
[36:56] and his family.
[36:58] And it's just what a joy it is to see
[37:00] him today in the house of the Lord. And
[37:02] as brother Bruce said also for sister
[37:05] Mary's mother Chi-Chi, God bless you for
[37:07] being here.
[37:08] Amen. With us. Well, if you would stand
[37:11] with me today for the reading of the
[37:13] word of God, um we will turn to the book
[37:17] of First John chapter 1. 1 John chapter
[37:22] 1.
[37:23] Um
[37:26] how is everybody's temperature?
[37:30] Okay, we we do have a schedule now for
[37:33] the AC. It's left on. So, we don't we
[37:35] don't need to turn the the furnaces off
[37:38] if we just keep them on. They should be
[37:41] on today. They were turned off. So, I
[37:43] apologize. I didn't know that. I would
[37:45] have got them turned on. In the back,
[37:47] our cry room, the window, I think,
[37:49] somehow broke. Um, I don't know when,
[37:53] but we think what had happened was that
[37:56] the the window was maybe put in a little
[37:59] bit too tight. as the wood with
[38:02] temperature, humidity, and that happens.
[38:04] It just uh tweaked it and and shattered.
[38:07] So, we got to get that fixed, but we
[38:10] apologize for that. We uh just in case
[38:12] something happens, I want everybody to
[38:14] stay in here. I don't mind a little bit
[38:15] of a little bit of crying with the kids
[38:17] and stuff. I want us to be together. I
[38:20] want us to hear the word, but
[38:22] the the TVs are out there if you you
[38:25] need to go. Even though we don't have a
[38:27] cryo room, we have a number of rooms. Uh
[38:30] I do want everybody to receive the
[38:32] message. I believe it's an important
[38:34] message today.
[38:36] Um
[38:38] what happens when you go on vacation is
[38:40] you you gain five pounds. You don't take
[38:43] your vitamins
[38:46] and you you have you have a lot of
[38:48] scriptures for the next service. And
[38:50] that's kind of what we got today. Amen.
[38:52] Before we begin reading, let's look to
[38:54] God in a word of prayer. Our heavenly
[38:57] father, we thank you that each one of us
[39:00] have been granted the privilege of being
[39:02] in your house today. Lord, that you
[39:05] watched over us to get here. You've
[39:06] given us health and strength to be here,
[39:08] that we could be together here as a
[39:10] family. And God, we just thank you for
[39:13] your presence in each side of uh your
[39:15] your bride here. And Lord, we're asking
[39:18] that you would help us today to be able
[39:20] to receive the word that you have for
[39:22] us, God. that we may grow.
[39:25] That we may grow as your word declares
[39:27] as calfs in the stall. That we may grow
[39:29] up to the stature of a perfect man. That
[39:32] we may be ready in that hour when you
[39:34] would call us home.
[39:36] Father, bless your people. Now, open the
[39:38] word to our hearts. Father, we ask that
[39:41] you would forgive us of our sins or
[39:42] trespasses, anything that has stood in
[39:44] the way of us walking where we need to
[39:47] walk with you. Lord, it's our desire to
[39:50] walk in the light as you're in the
[39:52] light. Pray now that you just take this
[39:55] word and bring the revelation that you
[39:57] would have for each and every one of us.
[39:58] We'll give you glory and honor now for
[40:00] these things in Jesus Christ's name.
[40:03] Amen.
[40:04] Amen. First John chapter 1 starting with
[40:06] verse number five.
[40:08] This then is the message which you have
[40:10] heard and de heard of him and declare
[40:13] unto you that God is light and in him is
[40:16] no darkness at all.
[40:19] If we say that we have fellowship with
[40:20] him and walk in darkness, we lie, do not
[40:23] the truth. But if we walk in the light
[40:25] as he is in the light, we have
[40:27] fellowship one with another. And the
[40:29] blood of Jesus Christ, his son, cleanses
[40:31] us from all sin.
[40:33] Amen.
[40:33] Amen. God bless you. You may be seated.
[40:36] Um, everybody views a relationship with
[40:39] God uh not the same. If I could say like
[40:42] that, some feel if they've repented,
[40:45] they got baptized, they're saved, they
[40:46] got a relationship with God, nothing
[40:48] really matters after that. Some feels if
[40:51] they just um you know, they attend a
[40:54] church, they have a relationship with
[40:56] God. If some feel if God just uses them
[41:00] to do things, they have a relationship
[41:01] with God. So there's so many views about
[41:05] a relationship with God.
[41:08] And today we want to uh talk about
[41:13] walking in the light of the word.
[41:17] Amen.
[41:18] Because that shows where we're at in our
[41:21] relationship with God. How many is
[41:22] thankful for the message of grace that
[41:24] we heard on Wednesday?
[41:26] Amen. Amen. We're thankful for grace.
[41:29] How many had a a happy 4th of July?
[41:33] Amen. Independence from Great Britain.
[41:36] Of course, our independence day was
[41:38] Calvary Day.
[41:41] We were made free. We were liberated
[41:42] from the devil. Jesus said, "He, if the
[41:46] Son, therefore shall make you free, you
[41:47] shall be free indeed."
[41:49] Amen.
[41:50] Now, we have our independence away from
[41:53] the devil. We got our independence
[41:56] uh uh our our independence away from the
[41:59] devil. And our dependency is on God.
[42:02] Amen.
[42:03] We still have a dependency on God.
[42:06] He just didn't set us free to do
[42:08] whatever we wanted to do.
[42:10] When Jesus set us free, he didn't just
[42:12] purchase our salvation, but he purchased
[42:14] us.
[42:15] Amen.
[42:15] He purchased our lives. And we're, the
[42:17] Bible says we're in debtors to God now.
[42:20] Amen.
[42:20] 1 Corinthians 6:19 says, "What know you
[42:23] not that your body is the temple of the
[42:25] Holy Ghost which is in you, which ye
[42:27] have of God, and you are not your own?"
[42:31] You're not your own.
[42:32] Amen.
[42:34] How many times have you ever thought
[42:36] these thoughts?
[42:38] I don't have to listen to you.
[42:40] I don't belong to you. You can't tell me
[42:43] what to do.
[42:45] Well, we belong to God.
[42:47] Amen.
[42:48] The Bible says, "For you are bought with
[42:50] a price. Therefore, glorify God in your
[42:53] body and in your spirit, which are God."
[42:56] So, we've been bought. If we've been
[42:57] saved, we've been bought. That's right.
[43:00] God gave us our dependence from the
[43:03] devil, but our dependency is still on
[43:04] the Lord. And the Lord wants us to stay
[43:08] free,
[43:10] to remain free.
[43:11] Amen.
[43:15] Now, the Bible says, "If the son shall
[43:18] make you free, you shall be free
[43:19] indeed." But we need to understand that
[43:22] we at any time
[43:25] not be free.
[43:28] Galatians 5:1 says, "Stand fast,
[43:30] therefore, in the liberty wherewith
[43:33] Christ has made us free and be not
[43:37] entangled again with the yoke of
[43:40] bondage."
[43:40] Amen.
[43:42] So, we have a warning here
[43:45] that even though we've been set free, we
[43:47] can entangle ourselves in the things of
[43:49] the world.
[43:51] On May 18th, 1786, just 10 years after
[43:55] the declaration
[43:57] of this great nation's independence,
[43:59] George Washington wrote these words in a
[44:01] letter. He said, "From the high ground
[44:02] on which we stood,
[44:05] from the plain path which invited our
[44:09] footsteps
[44:10] to be so fallen,
[44:14] so lost
[44:16] is really mortifying.
[44:19] But virtue, I fear, has in a great
[44:23] degree taken its departure from our
[44:26] land.
[44:28] Just 10 years.
[44:30] And virtue, that's our strength. You
[44:32] need strength to not get entangled again
[44:35] with the things that the devil wants us
[44:37] to get entangled with.
[44:39] So, we belong to God. He has set us
[44:41] free. And now God wants us to glorify
[44:44] him inside our bodies and in our
[44:46] spirits. And we can do that by walking
[44:49] in more light. New light.
[44:53] New light.
[44:54] Amen.
[44:54] To us.
[44:55] Yes.
[44:59] In other words, 1 Corinthians 10:12
[45:01] says, "Wherefore, let him that thinkketh
[45:02] he stand take heed lest he fall.
[45:07] Wherefore let him that thinkketh he
[45:09] stand fast, he that standing fast in the
[45:12] liberty where Christ has made us free,
[45:15] take heed, lest he not entangle himself
[45:17] again with the yoke of bondage.
[45:21] Amen.
[45:23] So if this great nation could do it, we
[45:26] can do it as Christians.
[45:28] Yes, sir.
[45:30] God is light. The Bible tells us God is
[45:32] light and in him is no darkness at all.
[45:34] So before Edison discovered the light
[45:36] bulb, God was light.
[45:39] Before the lanterns carried oil and were
[45:41] lit, God was light. Before there was
[45:43] ever a candle, God was light. Before
[45:46] there was fireflies, even God was light.
[45:50] Amen.
[45:51] Before God created the sun, God was
[45:54] light.
[45:55] Amen.
[45:56] In fact, when we're in the new
[45:57] Jerusalem, God will be the light there.
[45:59] Revelations 22:5 says, "And there shall
[46:02] be no night there, neither shall neither
[46:04] no candle, neither light of the sun, for
[46:07] the Lord God giveth and light, and they
[46:09] shall reign forever and ever."
[46:13] Amen.
[46:14] Now, when brother Brandham saw the
[46:16] pillar of fire or the light of God, he
[46:18] described it as amber and color. How
[46:21] many remember that? Always described as
[46:23] amber in color. Ezekiel 1:27 says, "And
[46:26] I saw as the color of amber, as it as
[46:31] the appearance of fire round about
[46:33] within it, from the appearance of the
[46:36] laurens even upward, and from the
[46:38] appearance of the Lawrence even
[46:39] downward. And I saw as it were the
[46:41] appearance of fire,
[46:43] and the brightness round about." So this
[46:47] is God. Now, he's called the invisible
[46:50] God, but he can appear as a pillar of
[46:54] fire.
[46:56] Um, Exodus 13 21 says, "The Lord went
[47:01] before them by day in the pillar of
[47:04] cloud to lead them the way by night in
[47:07] the pillar of fire to give them light to
[47:09] go by day and night. And he took verse
[47:12] 22 says and he took not away the pillar
[47:14] of cloud by day nor the pillar of fire
[47:17] by night from before the people.
[47:20] Amen.
[47:21] W with this scripture I really believe
[47:23] the pillar of fire is here today.
[47:26] Amen.
[47:26] The prophet said wherever this message
[47:28] is preached you will find the pillar of
[47:30] fire there. Amen.
[47:32] Now, we may not be visible to our eyes,
[47:35] but he is here.
[47:36] And he's here to lead and guide us into
[47:38] all truth today.
[47:40] That this same pillar of fire is the
[47:42] same pillar of fire that met Paul on the
[47:45] road to Damascus. Acts 9:1 says, "And
[47:48] Saul yet breathing out threatenings and
[47:50] slaughters against the disciples of the
[47:52] Lord, went unto the high priest, and
[47:55] desired of him letters to Damascus to
[47:57] the synagogues, that if he that if he be
[48:01] found any of this way, whether they be
[48:03] men or women, he he might bring them
[48:06] bound unto Jerusalem." And as he
[48:09] journeyed, he came near Damascus. And
[48:11] suddenly there shined round about him a
[48:15] light from heaven.
[48:18] And he fell to the earth and heard a
[48:20] voice out of that light, saying, Saul,
[48:23] Saul, why persecutest thou me?
[48:26] I believe the pillar of fire is here
[48:28] today speaking.
[48:31] But Jesus said, he that have ears to
[48:33] hear, let him hear what the spirit is
[48:35] saying to the church.
[48:37] The light from heaven was the same
[48:39] pillar of fire that led the children of
[48:42] Israel.
[48:46] See, God
[48:49] can that that that word light, it means
[48:52] to shine or to manifest.
[48:55] So, it's here and if God chooses to
[48:58] shine it or manifest it with these that
[49:01] we can see it with these eyes, we will
[49:03] see it. In fact, I don't have it right
[49:05] here, but everybody has seen the picture
[49:07] of the pillar of fire that's over the
[49:09] crest of brother Brandham's shoulder
[49:11] there. And he would see that often times
[49:14] in the audience.
[49:15] Amen.
[49:16] And uh it's uh it is the only picture
[49:20] that's ever supernatural picture that's
[49:23] been photographed of it.
[49:25] And uh what a privilege we are to to
[49:28] know that God is the same yesterday,
[49:30] today, and forever. Amen.
[49:33] Now God is a spiritual light but he also
[49:36] made natural light when he made the sun
[49:39] and he said let there be light and there
[49:42] was light and God saw that the light was
[49:44] good and God what did he do? He divided
[49:47] the light from the darkness.
[49:49] He divided it.
[49:52] God is in the business of dividing
[49:54] spiritual light from spiritual darkness
[49:57] because God is light and in him there is
[49:59] no darkness at all. God doesn't want
[50:02] things to remain gray.
[50:05] I'll just say it like this. Gray is not
[50:08] God's favorite color.
[50:13] So God is continuously dividing or
[50:16] separating light from darkness. God
[50:18] separated Jamis and Jambers. God
[50:21] separated Abraham from his family. God
[50:23] separate Abraham from Lot.
[50:27] Joshua said, "Choose you this day whom
[50:29] you will serve." If God be God, serve
[50:31] him.
[50:33] Constantly separating.
[50:36] Matthew 10:34, Jesus speak and says,
[50:38] "Think not that I came, I come to send
[50:42] peace to the earth.
[50:45] I came not to send peace,
[50:47] but a sword."
[50:48] Amen.
[50:49] But a sword. I came to send this word.
[50:52] Amen.
[50:53] For I am come to set a man at variance
[50:57] or set a sunder against his father and
[51:02] the daughter against her mother and the
[51:04] daughter-in-law against the
[51:05] mother-in-law.
[51:07] And a man's foe shall be of his own
[51:10] household.
[51:12] And he that loveth father or mother more
[51:14] than me is not worthy of me. And he that
[51:15] loveth son or daughter more than me is
[51:17] not worthy of me.
[51:20] So God is bringing every one of us to
[51:23] the place, are we going to put God first
[51:25] in our life?
[51:26] Are we going to separate from everything
[51:28] to walk in the light of God's word or
[51:30] are we not?
[51:33] Jesus Christ is continually separating
[51:36] light from darkness. And he's calling us
[51:38] to walk into the light of the the light
[51:42] of God's word as he shines it. But
[51:44] listen to this. I want us to catch this.
[51:47] He is not shining it right here.
[51:50] He's shining it away from us.
[51:54] That's why we got to go walk in it.
[51:57] We have this mentality that we're always
[51:59] in the light
[52:00] and we get more light through knowledge
[52:02] and we get this revelation here. No, but
[52:06] God is shining the light over there and
[52:07] it's up to us to go walk in it
[52:09] to get over there and walk in it. So, in
[52:11] order for me to walk in that light, that
[52:14] means I am not in that light. and
[52:16] there's a darkness and I'm in and I'm
[52:19] not in that light.
[52:21] That's a humbling thought. But
[52:23] but if we get that, we'll be more
[52:25] willing
[52:27] we'll be more willing to walk where we
[52:30] need to walk. You know, some of us get
[52:32] so stuffed we've been in the message a
[52:33] little bit. We're saved. We're we're
[52:36] we're and and praise God for that. But
[52:40] God is trying to bring us into more
[52:42] light.
[52:43] And it is so simple.
[52:52] That is really the crutch of the message
[52:53] there. If we can catch this that God, we
[52:57] come to church, God speaks the word to
[52:58] us. That's and it it it it touches our
[53:02] heart that you know God is speaking to
[53:04] us. What we need to do is leave the
[53:06] doors and go walk in that light. That's
[53:08] right.
[53:09] Not just say amen to it, not just agree
[53:11] with it,
[53:13] but to walk in that light as he is in
[53:15] the light.
[53:17] And that's that's a real relationship
[53:19] with God.
[53:20] 2 Corinthians 6:14.
[53:28] You know, one day we're going to be just
[53:30] like him,
[53:32] but right now we're like him and we're
[53:35] not like him. You understand what I'm
[53:37] saying? So he's he's wanting us to
[53:40] separate from darkness.
[53:44] And the scripture says in 2 Corinthians
[53:46] 6:14, "Be not unequally yolked together
[53:50] with unbelievers."
[53:54] Someone who's not believing
[53:57] as the word teaches us to believe.
[54:00] Right?
[54:01] For what fellowship have righteousness
[54:03] with unrighteousness? What communion
[54:06] have light? What darkness?
[54:10] And what concord have Christ with bil?
[54:13] Or what part have he that believeth with
[54:16] an infidel? And you in this message, you
[54:18] will find all sorts of people, all sorts
[54:21] of beliefs. Well, I believe this, but I
[54:23] don't believe that.
[54:25] I believe this part of the word, but I
[54:27] don't believe that.
[54:29] And what they're doing when somebody is
[54:31] denying what the Holy Ghost wrote or
[54:34] what the Holy Ghost brought in this age,
[54:37] they're literally showing that they're
[54:38] in darkness and they don't know it.
[54:41] Now, they may be able to convince
[54:45] some of the people some of the time, but
[54:47] you're certainly not going to convince
[54:48] all the people all the time because
[54:50] there is a bride that knows that the
[54:52] message of the hour is the the light
[54:54] that we're supposed to be walking in.
[55:01] And what concord? Okay. And all right.
[55:03] Verse 16. And what agreement have the
[55:06] temple of God with idols? For ye are the
[55:09] temple of the living God. As God has
[55:11] said, I will dwell in them and walk in
[55:13] them, and I will be their God, and they
[55:14] shall be my people. Wherefore, what do
[55:17] we got to do? Wherefore, come out from
[55:19] among them. In other words, come out of
[55:23] the darkness. Can I hit this for a
[55:26] second?
[55:29] Okay. So, there's a this is kind of
[55:31] really bad because you still got light.
[55:33] So, there's a light here, right? God is
[55:35] shining a light, which means I'm not in
[55:38] it right now.
[55:41] So, come out of her
[55:44] and be not partakers, and I will receive
[55:47] you. You have to walk in the word that's
[55:50] being preached,
[55:51] in the word that you hear,
[55:53] in the messages that you're listening
[55:55] to.
[55:56] It's not a matter of coming to church
[55:58] and feeling satisfied that I came to
[56:00] church and I I was there and it was a
[56:01] good message and it's something to
[56:03] rejoice about. No, it that's not it.
[56:05] That's not the relationship. The
[56:07] relationship is to get in the light that
[56:09] he's preaching to us. We should be
[56:10] growing.
[56:15] So wherefore come out from among them
[56:17] and be separate, sayith the Lord, and
[56:19] touch not the thing unclean thing and I
[56:22] will receive you and I will be a father
[56:25] unto you. and you shall be my sons and
[56:26] daughters, saith the Lord. To me, that's
[56:29] a relationship.
[56:30] That's what a relationship is.
[56:34] Jesus said, I know thy works, speaking
[56:36] to the church age here, that thou art
[56:38] neither cold or hot, I would that you
[56:41] were cold or hot. So then, because thou
[56:43] art lukewarm, neither cold or hot, I
[56:44] would spew thee out of my mouth. God
[56:46] even he he is has, if I could say this,
[56:50] has more respect for some. He's just,
[56:52] I'm not going to serve God. I'm not even
[56:53] going to try.
[56:55] than for somebody to be act like it and
[56:57] they're not. And you know,
[57:00] I mean, you may be able to fool people
[57:04] who don't know.
[57:06] You may,
[57:07] but you're not going to fool the bride.
[57:10] You're not going to fool God.
[57:12] God doesn't do gray.
[57:15] This then is the message that we heard
[57:16] of him and declare unto you that God is
[57:19] light and in him is no darkness at all.
[57:22] Amen. So God, you can see God's desire
[57:26] for every one of us here is to walk more
[57:29] in the light than what we are.
[57:33] Amen.
[57:34] So the nature of God's light is to
[57:35] always be separating man from the
[57:37] darkness that he's in. And that's a
[57:39] humbling thought to think that actually
[57:42] that there's darkness in me.
[57:44] But you know, Brother Ram says we come
[57:46] to the church to find out where we're at
[57:48] with God,
[57:49] right? And if if we think that's just,
[57:52] you know, once in a blue moon or when
[57:54] we've had a bad day or no, I it's it's
[57:58] God has a vision to bring us into his
[58:00] image and he's predestinated us to be
[58:03] conformed to that image. And if we're
[58:05] going to be there on that day just like
[58:07] him, that means every day he's in the
[58:10] process of bringing us closer into that
[58:12] image into to a a light to where there's
[58:15] no darkness at all.
[58:22] 2 Timothy 3:16 says, "All scripture is
[58:25] given by the inspiration of God and is
[58:28] profitable for reproof, for correction,
[58:32] for instruction, in righteousness,
[58:35] that we, the man of God, may be perfect,
[58:39] entire, or thoroughly furnished unto all
[58:42] good works." Now, to me, I believe
[58:45] perfect is no darkness at all.
[58:48] It's it's all Christ now. That's what
[58:50] the scriptur is for. But you know Jesus
[58:52] said it like this to the people when he
[58:53] walked the earth. He says men love
[58:55] darkness rather than light.
[58:58] And we got to make a decision. Choose.
[59:00] We got to choose. Do we want light or do
[59:02] we want gray?
[59:04] Right? Do we want darkness or do we want
[59:06] light?
[59:08] So if we come to God's house to discover
[59:10] where we're at, then it's okay to be
[59:13] here sitting here with a humble heart
[59:15] saying, "I'm not sure where I'm at with
[59:16] God.
[59:18] You want to find favor with God. That's
[59:19] the attitude to have when you're in the
[59:21] house of God. Right there.
[59:23] First Peter 4:17 says, "For the time is
[59:25] come that judgment must begin at the
[59:28] house of God."
[59:29] "And if it first begin at us, what shall
[59:33] the end of them that obey not the
[59:35] gospel? And if the righteous scarcely be
[59:38] saved, where shall the ungodly and the
[59:39] sinner appear?" So, you know, truly the
[59:41] bride comes to church and they're when
[59:43] they come to church, they come with this
[59:45] attitude. They come with reverence. They
[59:47] come with the fear of God. They come
[59:50] with I want to be pleasing with God.
[59:52] They come to find out where they're at
[59:54] with God
[59:56] because that's how it's going to be on
[59:58] the day of judgment.
[1:00:00] They're going to be standing there.
[1:00:01] They're going to be being judged without
[1:00:04] mercy on the day of judgment. And it's a
[1:00:06] fearful thing to stand to fall in the
[1:00:08] hands of a living God. He's a consuming
[1:00:10] fire. Amen.
[1:00:12] But we the bride, we we reverence, we
[1:00:16] respect God's house. We respect the
[1:00:19] word. That is the it's it is the it is
[1:00:21] the headship of our lives. And we come
[1:00:24] into God's house with a reverence for
[1:00:27] the word. We believe the word. We don't
[1:00:29] just, you know, get out and in and out
[1:00:31] of the service and not paying attention
[1:00:33] and and sleeping and thinking about
[1:00:36] other things. No, because we're walking
[1:00:39] into the throne, the white throne.
[1:00:41] judgment for the bride is right here in
[1:00:43] the house of God.
[1:00:46] And she she takes the word that God
[1:00:48] gives them because it's being ministered
[1:00:50] with mercy. God brings the word with
[1:00:53] mercy. That's what happens right now.
[1:00:58] And that's why we don't stand at the
[1:01:01] white throne judgment over there. We sit
[1:01:04] with him on the throne.
[1:01:06] Amen. Praise God. How many's thankful
[1:01:09] for the grace of God today? Amen.
[1:01:12] But when the word of God is preached,
[1:01:14] its target is a sincere
[1:01:17] heart that will walk in the light.
[1:01:19] That's truly its target. But we do know
[1:01:22] as Jesus taught us that the word of God
[1:01:25] actually hits four different types of
[1:01:26] ground, right? Four different hearts.
[1:01:30] But God is looking for not just a hearer
[1:01:32] of the word, but a doer of the word.
[1:01:34] Amen. So when we come to church and
[1:01:37] learn where the light is shining, oh, he
[1:01:42] wants me to do that. He wants me to pray
[1:01:44] more.
[1:01:45] He wants me to spend time in the
[1:01:46] message.
[1:01:47] He wants me to reach out.
[1:01:49] Yes.
[1:01:49] He wants me to to to to love the
[1:01:51] brethren.
[1:01:52] Yes.
[1:01:53] He wants me to um to to to spend more
[1:01:57] time with him. He wants me to prepare
[1:02:00] before service. He wants me to come into
[1:02:02] church with more reverence, more fear.
[1:02:04] He wants to get rid of this thing in my
[1:02:06] life. So when we when he's shining that
[1:02:09] light away from us,
[1:02:11] we go walk in it. We go walk in it.
[1:02:14] That's the answer. We don't sit here and
[1:02:16] we like, well, yeah, I got the light.
[1:02:18] I'm, you know, I got all of God.
[1:02:22] Is that it?
[1:02:26] We got to come before God with
[1:02:28] reverence.
[1:02:29] Amen. with a sound mind that there's
[1:02:32] there's probably darkness in me. How
[1:02:35] many today before you came into the
[1:02:37] sanctuary went into the prayer room and
[1:02:39] said, "Lord, forgive me of my sins
[1:02:41] today. Cover me with your blood today."
[1:02:45] Because we knew
[1:02:48] that we're not perfectly white as snow.
[1:02:52] It's him that makes us white.
[1:02:55] But yet, we just can't just do what we
[1:02:57] want and plead the blood.
[1:03:02] No, they overcame not just by the blood
[1:03:04] of the lamb, but they they love not
[1:03:08] their lives to death.
[1:03:12] And they had a testimony that they
[1:03:14] walked in the light as he was in the
[1:03:16] light.
[1:03:18] The word. They walked in the word.
[1:03:22] All right. Nehemiah chapter 13.
[1:03:26] We're going to spend a little bit just
[1:03:28] time looking into Nema. How many's
[1:03:30] enjoying the message?
[1:03:32] Amen. Praise the Lord. Don't get too
[1:03:34] quiet.
[1:03:38] Nehemiah 13:1, on that day they read in
[1:03:41] the Bible, we say the book of Moses
[1:03:46] in the audience of the people. So this
[1:03:48] must have been in church, right? Amen.
[1:03:51] And therein was found written that the
[1:03:55] Amorites
[1:03:56] and the Moabitete should not come into
[1:03:59] the congregation of God forever.
[1:04:02] So they just read this
[1:04:05] because they met not the children of
[1:04:07] Israel with bread and with water, but
[1:04:10] hired Balam against them that he should
[1:04:13] curse them. How be it our God turned the
[1:04:16] curse into a blessing. Because God God
[1:04:19] knows how to do that, doesn't he?
[1:04:21] Right
[1:04:22] now. Look at verse three. Now it came to
[1:04:23] pass when they had heard the law
[1:04:28] that they separated from Israel all the
[1:04:31] mixed multitude.
[1:04:34] In other words, they read, the light was
[1:04:37] shining, and after they read, they did
[1:04:41] what the word told them to do.
[1:04:43] Amen.
[1:04:44] And that's just the simplicity of coming
[1:04:47] to church and hearing from God.
[1:04:51] We want God
[1:04:54] to do what we want for us.
[1:04:57] We want God to do this and take care of
[1:05:00] this and help with this. And God is a
[1:05:02] good God. He will. We want that. But the
[1:05:05] thing is, God also wants a relationship.
[1:05:08] If you Yes, I'm do that. I'm good to my
[1:05:11] enemies.
[1:05:13] But God says, "If you love me, keep my
[1:05:15] commandments." So there's a a two side
[1:05:18] here. And this is just an example, a
[1:05:20] simple example of coming to church,
[1:05:22] hearing the word of God, and then
[1:05:24] walking in it.
[1:05:26] And to me, it's a beautiful example.
[1:05:29] People just don't reverence God's house
[1:05:31] like they used to.
[1:05:32] Amen.
[1:05:34] People today have made church what they
[1:05:36] want it to be.
[1:05:38] They go to church today for all sorts of
[1:05:40] reasons, all sorts of motives. They want
[1:05:42] entertainment. They want to laugh. They
[1:05:43] want to feel good when they leave.
[1:05:45] But they're not laboring to enter into
[1:05:47] the rest which is in God's word.
[1:05:52] It seems like the last thing they want
[1:05:53] to do is walk in the light.
[1:05:57] Now, we have some scriptures that teach
[1:05:59] us how to actually conduct ourselves in
[1:06:02] the house of God. There's actually
[1:06:04] scriptures for that. It's in Nehemiah
[1:06:06] chapter 8.
[1:06:08] So, we're going to get a lesson what to
[1:06:10] do when you come into church. Amen.
[1:06:12] You ever like go to church for the first
[1:06:14] time, never been there, and you're like
[1:06:15] thinking, I wonder how how they do
[1:06:18] things here.
[1:06:20] I I wonder how it's going to be. This is
[1:06:22] odd. I'm not used to. So to me, this is
[1:06:25] the pattern for God's people right here
[1:06:27] that we're going to read. Nehemiah
[1:06:30] chapter 8 verse one. And all the people
[1:06:32] gathered themselves together as one
[1:06:35] man into the street. And there was
[1:06:37] before the Watergate, and they spake
[1:06:39] unto Ezra the scribe, to bring the book
[1:06:42] of the law of Moses, which the Lord had
[1:06:43] commanded to Israel.
[1:06:46] And Ezra the priest brought the law
[1:06:48] before the congregation, both of men and
[1:06:50] women, and all that could hear with
[1:06:52] understanding
[1:06:53] unto the first day of the seventh month.
[1:06:56] And he read therein before the street
[1:06:59] that was before the Watergate from the
[1:07:02] morning until midday before the men, the
[1:07:05] women, those that could understand. And
[1:07:07] the ears of all the people were
[1:07:09] attentive unto the book of law that were
[1:07:11] attentive. They were they were right
[1:07:14] there in church paying attention. They
[1:07:16] were attentive to what was being read.
[1:07:18] And Ezra the scribe stood upon a pulpit
[1:07:21] of wood which they had made for the
[1:07:24] purpose. And beside him stood, oh,
[1:07:27] Matia, Shima, and Annayiah. You know
[1:07:32] these names probably better than I do.
[1:07:36] And that was on the right hand. And then
[1:07:37] on the left hand were these others. So
[1:07:39] there was a there was a support group
[1:07:41] there.
[1:07:42] There was a support group there.
[1:07:45] And Ezra opened the book in the sight of
[1:07:47] all the people, for he was above all the
[1:07:51] people. And when he opened it, all the
[1:07:54] people stood up.
[1:07:55] Amen.
[1:07:56] And Ezra blessed the Lord, the great
[1:08:00] God. And all the people answered,
[1:08:03] "Amen."
[1:08:04] Amen. Amen. What with lifting up of
[1:08:08] their hands, and they bowed their heads,
[1:08:11] and they worshiped the Lord with their
[1:08:13] faces to the ground. You talk about
[1:08:16] humility. We can't even get us to
[1:08:17] sometimes praise the Lord. Amen.
[1:08:21] I'm telling you, we we are making church
[1:08:24] different than what it should be.
[1:08:27] We got to get back. Get back.
[1:08:34] And then all these people stood in their
[1:08:36] place. And verse eight says, "So they
[1:08:38] read in the book of the law of God
[1:08:41] distinctly and gave the sense and caused
[1:08:43] them to understand the reading." So
[1:08:45] that's why we come to church. We come to
[1:08:47] church to really find out where we're at
[1:08:49] with God. And he deserves to be praised
[1:08:51] with all of our heart. I don't believe
[1:08:53] it's ever I don't I look, you got the
[1:08:56] worship leader. He's up here and he's
[1:08:59] trying to lead.
[1:09:02] And it is our job in the congregation to
[1:09:05] get in the spirit,
[1:09:07] to get in sync, to be in a harmony.
[1:09:10] We're a symphony. and to get in the
[1:09:12] harmony with with worship and praise and
[1:09:15] and not I don't feel like it and I just
[1:09:17] you know you got to get me there. No.
[1:09:22] No. You know what you're doing? You're
[1:09:24] you're putting your nose up to God.
[1:09:27] God deserves your best
[1:09:30] before you enter into the sanctuary.
[1:09:33] Amen.
[1:09:34] Amen. Amen. Amen. Nehemiah chapter 9
[1:09:37] verse one.
[1:09:39] Now in the 20th and fourth day of the
[1:09:42] month, the children of Israel were
[1:09:43] assembled together fasting with
[1:09:46] sackcloth and upon and earth upon them.
[1:09:50] And the seed of Israel separated
[1:09:52] themselves from all strangers and stood
[1:09:55] and confessed their sins and their
[1:09:56] iniquities of their fathers. How
[1:09:59] beautiful this is. And they stood up in
[1:10:01] their place and read the book of the law
[1:10:03] of the Lord their God one/4th part of
[1:10:06] the day. and another four part of the
[1:10:08] day they confessed and worshiped the
[1:10:10] Lord their God. Then stood up upon the
[1:10:12] stairs of the the Levites, these men,
[1:10:15] and they cried with a loud voice unto
[1:10:17] the Lord their God. And the Levites and
[1:10:20] these men uh said, "Stand up and bless
[1:10:25] the Lord your God forever and ever. And
[1:10:28] blessed blessed be thy glorious name
[1:10:31] which is exalted above all blessings."
[1:10:35] exalted above all blessings and praise.
[1:10:37] Amen.
[1:10:38] Isn't that beautiful?
[1:10:39] Amen.
[1:10:40] I mean, I I believe we should come the
[1:10:41] house with this in mind. I come here for
[1:10:44] God. I come here for God.
[1:10:47] It's God and me.
[1:10:49] As you can see where brother Brandon
[1:10:50] said so many times, we don't come here
[1:10:52] to fellowship with one another.
[1:10:54] It's it's a we need to like so often we
[1:10:56] see one another, we want to connect with
[1:10:58] one another. It's been a while and that
[1:10:59] is important,
[1:11:01] but you know, to me, what's the most
[1:11:03] important things? It should be on your
[1:11:05] heart and mind. I want to I want to
[1:11:06] receive from God. I've been praying all
[1:11:08] week. I've been thinking about I just
[1:11:10] want I want to hear from God. I I want
[1:11:13] to find out where I'm really at with
[1:11:14] God.
[1:11:15] Amen.
[1:11:17] Yes.
[1:11:18] Now, Isaiah said, "Behold, the Lord's
[1:11:20] hand is not shortened that it cannot
[1:11:21] save, neither is it heavy that it cannot
[1:11:23] hear, but your iniquities has separated
[1:11:26] between you and your God, and your sins
[1:11:28] have hid his face from you that you will
[1:11:32] not hear." H. So we see that there could
[1:11:35] be things even in our life that could
[1:11:37] separate us from a closer fellowship
[1:11:39] with God. Amen.
[1:11:41] So we want to define for just a moment
[1:11:44] how God is shining around us or if I
[1:11:48] could say it like this away from us. If
[1:11:51] we're going to walk in the light, I just
[1:11:53] want you to imagine, okay, you you come,
[1:11:56] do you remember the old church? Some of
[1:11:58] us been at the old church. The lighting
[1:12:00] wasn't real good there.
[1:12:03] And and sometimes uh here uh the light's
[1:12:07] pretty good here, but you know the
[1:12:09] difference between walking in darkness
[1:12:12] and where the light is at, right?
[1:12:15] Big difference. We've been in parking
[1:12:17] lot, supermarkets, and all types of
[1:12:19] things where there's lighting and where
[1:12:21] the light was there. It was brighter and
[1:12:24] you could see better. And sometimes you
[1:12:25] want to park where there's a light,
[1:12:28] right?
[1:12:28] Amen. The point I'm trying to make is
[1:12:32] when you are looking and there's a light
[1:12:34] there that is shining brighter than
[1:12:36] where you're at, you have to confess
[1:12:38] that you're not in that light.
[1:12:42] You have to confess it. You're not
[1:12:43] there.
[1:12:45] And and and and so now you're like, "Oh
[1:12:47] yeah, there's a light there. I want to
[1:12:48] get there." So naturally, you do.
[1:12:52] Well, spiritually, it has to be the same
[1:12:53] way. When we come to the house of God,
[1:12:55] we have to recognize that there is
[1:12:58] darkness that we're walking in. And God
[1:13:00] is calling us to the light of his word.
[1:13:05] So, he's letting us know where he's at,
[1:13:08] where he wants us to be, and where to
[1:13:11] start walking towards.
[1:13:13] Draw a nigh to me, and I'll draw nigh to
[1:13:15] you. It's it's all part of the process.
[1:13:18] It's not coming to church learning about
[1:13:20] God in our head and feel that we are a
[1:13:22] little closer to God because we're
[1:13:24] learning. It's not about that. It
[1:13:27] learning is just going to puff you up.
[1:13:28] That's what knowledge does. But I'm
[1:13:30] telling you, a relationship is you're
[1:13:33] just sincere. You mean business and
[1:13:35] you're ready to start getting closer to
[1:13:37] God.
[1:13:38] And we can't expect God to do
[1:13:40] everything. To me, it's the grace of God
[1:13:42] that he just tells us where we're at.
[1:13:45] It's the grace of God that he just tells
[1:13:47] us
[1:13:57] Paul told Timothy, "Nevertheless, the
[1:13:59] foundation of God stand sure having this
[1:14:01] seal. The Lord knoweth them that are
[1:14:03] his, and let everyone that nameth the
[1:14:05] name of Christ depart from iniquity."
[1:14:08] So, in other words, you've got to get
[1:14:11] out of the darkness and walk into the
[1:14:13] light. Everyone that says, "Yeah, I
[1:14:16] belong to God. I'm a Christian.
[1:14:19] Everyone that nameth the name of Christ,
[1:14:21] right? Many will come to me in that day
[1:14:22] say, "Lord, Lord, didn't I do this and
[1:14:24] do that and do that?" You know, I I
[1:14:26] thought I was going in the rapture,
[1:14:30] but decided not to really have a
[1:14:33] relationship. Now, a relationship with
[1:14:35] God is truly
[1:14:38] not just in the mindset, well, I I I I'm
[1:14:41] I'm separating from iniquity, but it's
[1:14:43] the it's the mindset of I'm going to
[1:14:46] walk in the light in a sincere way. I'm
[1:14:49] going to be sincere with God.
[1:14:52] And I I believe we're all in the same
[1:14:54] boat. We all have the same challenge
[1:14:58] that is there something Lord inside of
[1:15:01] me that you want me to separate from?
[1:15:05] Is there is there somewhere the light is
[1:15:08] shining around me that you want me to
[1:15:10] walk in?
[1:15:11] Amen.
[1:15:12] So God is always separating a spiritual
[1:15:17] darkness from his bride. So as God
[1:15:21] shines light away from you, he's calling
[1:15:24] you. Actually, what he's doing, okay, so
[1:15:26] brother Brand me had say, see the light,
[1:15:28] it's over there. It's above him or the
[1:15:30] light's over there. See it now. You
[1:15:32] can't. It's just
[1:15:34] he was pointing where Christ was at
[1:15:36] where the light was.
[1:15:39] And when he, the spirit of truth, will
[1:15:41] come, he will lead and guide you into
[1:15:43] all truth. So how does he do that? He
[1:15:45] shines the light where he wants you to
[1:15:48] go, right?
[1:15:51] to stay here and say, "Well, I'm okay
[1:15:53] here. I'm a good Christian. I've been
[1:15:55] baptized.
[1:15:57] You know, I'm in the message." That's
[1:16:00] not the relationship that he has with
[1:16:01] his bride.
[1:16:03] But it is something that the devil is
[1:16:05] concocting.
[1:16:07] And and what we got to realize, it's
[1:16:09] okay if we come to church and we hear
[1:16:10] something that kind of pricks our heart,
[1:16:12] pricks our conscience. It's good. That's
[1:16:14] the way it should be.
[1:16:16] We don't want to come to church and just
[1:16:18] have a good time.
[1:16:19] We just don't want to always feel good.
[1:16:22] To me, it's a good feeling to know that
[1:16:24] God is calling me higher.
[1:16:30] I want to be higher. I want to be
[1:16:32] closer.
[1:16:36] Now, there's benefits of walking in the
[1:16:38] light. And scripture says that the blood
[1:16:41] of Christ stays intact.
[1:16:46] In other words,
[1:16:49] we can't do what we want to do and just
[1:16:52] keep saying, "Yeah, I God, cover me with
[1:16:55] your blood
[1:16:58] and expect to make it."
[1:17:01] Then there would be no word that tells
[1:17:03] us to walk in the light.
[1:17:05] Right?
[1:17:06] So if we walk in the light, then the
[1:17:10] blood of Jesus Christ cleanses us from
[1:17:12] all sin.
[1:17:13] Amen. So it's real important to walk in
[1:17:15] the word.
[1:17:17] The benefits of walking in the light is
[1:17:20] it keeps the token applied. That's
[1:17:23] right.
[1:17:24] It keeps the token applied to your life,
[1:17:27] to your family.
[1:17:28] Yes.
[1:17:30] And our fellowship with God remains
[1:17:34] unbroken.
[1:17:36] You know, a lot of times people, they
[1:17:38] just don't care about their relationship
[1:17:40] with God.
[1:17:43] They're just interested in God blessing
[1:17:45] them, God helping them,
[1:17:47] or yeah, I I want, you know, this
[1:17:50] brother to help me, this sister to help
[1:17:51] me, this husband to help me, this wife
[1:17:52] to help me. But they're not thinking
[1:17:56] about relationship.
[1:17:58] They're not thinking two ways. They're
[1:18:00] just thinking one way. And that's why
[1:18:03] Jesus said, "All that ever come before
[1:18:04] me are thieves and robbers." But God is
[1:18:08] looking for a relationship. And and to
[1:18:11] me it's like this. If
[1:18:15] if you don't want to have a
[1:18:16] relationship, this is God's message.
[1:18:20] I would rather have you cold.
[1:18:26] You might as well go and enjoy the
[1:18:28] world.
[1:18:30] Enjoy it. You know, Brother Joe Ward
[1:18:33] says a number of times, the most
[1:18:34] miserable thing is a a Christian who's
[1:18:37] half in and half out. is the most
[1:18:40] miserable place to be living in.
[1:18:44] We got to remember who God is.
[1:18:47] Amen.
[1:18:47] God
[1:18:49] is light
[1:18:50] and in him is no darkness at all.
[1:18:55] We need to be careful about any light
[1:18:59] that is associated with gray.
[1:19:02] That's really good.
[1:19:04] So, I just want to get into this a
[1:19:05] little bit about Lucifer. Isaiah for uh
[1:19:08] 14:12 says, "How art thou fallen from
[1:19:11] heaven, oh Lucifer." Son of the morning.
[1:19:17] Now, son of the morning means dawn or
[1:19:22] early light.
[1:19:24] How are thou cut down from the ground as
[1:19:26] weakest the nations? Lucifer means
[1:19:29] morning star. It means brightness. It
[1:19:32] also means lightbearer and lightbringer.
[1:19:36] This is Lucifer. He was the anointed
[1:19:39] cheruban. The Bible says, "And I have
[1:19:42] made thee." So God made him the cheruban
[1:19:45] that was over. Brother Brandham said,
[1:19:47] "The right- hand man."
[1:19:51] We could say that Lucifer is a
[1:19:53] lightbearer, but in him is darkness.
[1:19:58] Catch that. He's a lightbearer, but in
[1:20:01] him is darkness, which creates gray. You
[1:20:03] understand? Not you can't depend on
[1:20:05] them.
[1:20:07] Lucifer was full of wisdom and full of
[1:20:09] beauty. Thou art the anointed cherub
[1:20:12] that coverth and I have set thee so.
[1:20:14] Lucifer was perfect in his ways from the
[1:20:16] day that thou was created till iniquary
[1:20:18] is found in him. And Ezekiel 28:17 says,
[1:20:21] "Thine heart was lifted up because of
[1:20:24] thy beauty."
[1:20:26] because of thy beauty.
[1:20:28] Thou has corrupted thy wisdom by reason
[1:20:33] of thy brightness. Lucifer was so
[1:20:36] bright. He had so much light. He carried
[1:20:40] so much light. He led the worship. He
[1:20:42] had so much. But this brightness
[1:20:46] literally corrupted him. Amen.
[1:20:53] So
[1:20:55] when we're out there getting these ideas
[1:20:57] and taking part of the word but not the
[1:20:59] other part of the word, taking part of
[1:21:01] the message but not the other part of
[1:21:02] the message, you do understand that
[1:21:05] Lucifer is a carrier.
[1:21:09] But in him there's some darkness. He
[1:21:13] brings a message. Well, you know, it's
[1:21:15] okay to do this but not do that.
[1:21:19] Didn't he tell the children of Israel,
[1:21:20] "Well, the men could go, but the women,
[1:21:22] they got to stay.
[1:21:24] The cattle got to stay. The children got
[1:21:26] to stay."
[1:21:29] He's always trying to get us to
[1:21:31] compromise.
[1:21:34] He brings some light to catch you.
[1:21:36] Oh, God does know that the day you eat,
[1:21:39] you'll be just like him.
[1:21:40] Amen.
[1:21:41] Carry some light.
[1:21:45] Brother Brandham said in the message the
[1:21:47] seal of the antichrist he says did you
[1:21:49] know that in heaven that the devil was
[1:21:51] God's right-hand man in the beginning
[1:21:54] that Lucifer the son of the morning was
[1:21:57] given power the right-hand man of
[1:22:00] almighty God was Lucifer the son of the
[1:22:03] morning the first God granted him almost
[1:22:07] co-workers with him he was a coworker
[1:22:10] partly equal with him only Satan could
[1:22:13] not create.
[1:22:16] Questions and answers 59. Brother
[1:22:17] Brandon says, "See Satan, the original
[1:22:20] archangel of God. He once was the
[1:22:22] greatest person in heaven outside of
[1:22:24] God. He was God's right-hand man in
[1:22:27] fellowship. He got all puffed up in his
[1:22:29] heart. And isn't that just the way the
[1:22:31] people is today? Let God just bless
[1:22:34] bless a fellow, put a little confidence
[1:22:36] in him, and he gets to be a knowit all.
[1:22:39] He gets to be he he's got to some
[1:22:42] organization. He's got to do something
[1:22:44] that's different. Why art thou fallen
[1:22:47] from heaven, oh Lucifer?
[1:22:49] God has a hard time trying to get
[1:22:52] somebody that he can deal with that can
[1:22:54] stay humble and meek and stay in the
[1:22:57] place until God calls him to do
[1:22:59] something. A man that God is blessed and
[1:23:02] he'll just keep himself a man and not an
[1:23:04] angel or God. And as soon as the man
[1:23:07] gets blessed and has a little something
[1:23:09] given to him, he wants to become a god.
[1:23:12] He wants to become an angel. He wants to
[1:23:14] become some great person. Oh, what? Oh,
[1:23:16] what I do, what me and me and mine and
[1:23:19] mine, all that.
[1:23:21] Said that's the wrong attitude.
[1:23:23] Amen.
[1:23:24] Said God is hunting for somebody who
[1:23:27] will who could he could bless and pour
[1:23:29] out the blessings. And the more he's
[1:23:32] blessed, the little the man becomes.
[1:23:38] The way up is down.
[1:23:44] And you'll never get more of God until
[1:23:47] you become nothing.
[1:23:49] You got to belittle yourself. Oh my.
[1:23:55] You've got to belittle yourself. Well,
[1:23:56] I'm telling you, that's what it means to
[1:23:57] humble yourself.
[1:24:00] You got to belittle yourself. He that
[1:24:02] will exalt himself, God will bring a
[1:24:05] base. And he that humble for God will
[1:24:09] exalt. You've got to get little before
[1:24:12] you can get big.
[1:24:14] And you'll never be big in your own
[1:24:16] self. You're only as big as God will be
[1:24:19] big in you.
[1:24:22] So Lucifer is on the earth today and
[1:24:26] he's trying to work in the church to
[1:24:28] accomplish the same person that he
[1:24:30] started before the foundation of the
[1:24:32] world. Now he's trying just like look,
[1:24:34] he's got power. He's got such power that
[1:24:37] he won a third of heaven over to him.
[1:24:41] I'm pretty sure he's got power to
[1:24:43] convince church members over to him.
[1:24:49] Now, what did he offer the angels? The
[1:24:52] same thing that he offers us. Your will
[1:24:54] to do what you want.
[1:24:56] Right? You don't got to read. You don't
[1:24:58] got to pray. You don't got to dedicate.
[1:25:00] You don't got to do all that. All you
[1:25:01] got to do is this, say this, and this
[1:25:02] and everything's okay.
[1:25:04] So, he's got power to do that. Lucifer
[1:25:07] still has brightness. He's still a
[1:25:10] lightbearer. He's still a lightbrer. The
[1:25:12] devil has the ability to bear light, but
[1:25:15] in him there's darkness.
[1:25:18] And when you see that, you're talking to
[1:25:20] somebody and they're trying to get you
[1:25:22] to compromise the word. The Bible says
[1:25:26] from such turn away,
[1:25:29] turn away because it will corrupt you.
[1:25:32] You got to the higher you raise your
[1:25:34] standard,
[1:25:37] the closer you'll get to God. Amen.
[1:25:40] And I'll say it like this. Though none
[1:25:41] go with me, still I'll follow.
[1:25:45] I'm okay if I'm not popular. I am okay
[1:25:48] with that.
[1:25:49] Because on that day when the rapture
[1:25:51] happens, popularity ain't going to get
[1:25:54] me in there.
[1:25:55] Friendship ain't going to get me in
[1:25:57] there.
[1:26:00] God's the only one that can get me in a
[1:26:02] rapture.
[1:26:03] God is light and in him is no darkness
[1:26:06] at all. Matthew 24:24 Jesus said, "For
[1:26:09] there shall rise false Christs and false
[1:26:13] prophets, false anointed ones," Brother
[1:26:14] Brandham said, "and false lights, and
[1:26:17] shall show great signs and wonders in so
[1:26:19] much as if it were possible, it shall
[1:26:21] deceive the very light." So, you
[1:26:23] understand that there's going to be
[1:26:25] enough light
[1:26:28] to get people's attention. Oh, wow. Oh,
[1:26:31] wow. This this must be the the real
[1:26:34] thing.
[1:26:36] But inside there's some darkness.
[1:26:42] Brother Abraham said the message Christ
[1:26:44] is the mystery of God revealed. And here
[1:26:46] is Lucifer at the job again today. And
[1:26:49] remember the antichrist is not
[1:26:51] communism. The antichrist is so close
[1:26:54] like the real thing to it deceive the
[1:26:57] very elect if it were possible. Jesus
[1:26:59] said
[1:27:02] one time in 1963 I heard as the date
[1:27:05] that there was a great train robbery
[1:27:08] and it was actually achieved by a fall
[1:27:11] flight. Some of you have heard the
[1:27:14] story. I'm sure there was like 15 men
[1:27:17] and the train passed uh through
[1:27:20] Lennington Bazard at 300 a.m. on August
[1:27:24] 8, 1963. And moments later, the driver,
[1:27:27] Jack Mills, saw a red signal ahead at
[1:27:31] the place called Sears Crossing. The
[1:27:33] signal was false. Notice the signal was
[1:27:36] false, but yet it caught the attention.
[1:27:40] A glove had been stuffed into the proper
[1:27:43] signal and the red light was activated
[1:27:47] by attaching a sixvolt battery. So
[1:27:50] there's on the train track you got green
[1:27:52] and red and it tells you green you're
[1:27:54] going keep going. The red says no you
[1:27:57] better stop. And they were a they were
[1:27:59] supposed to go through this but the the
[1:28:01] the the the train robbers said well
[1:28:03] we'll just put something to hide the
[1:28:06] green light. Put a sixvolt battery to
[1:28:08] the red one. It'll show and the train
[1:28:10] will stop. The 15 men in Oh the train
[1:28:14] stopped. The 15 men robbed the train.
[1:28:17] Yes.
[1:28:17] And it was by a false light. Amen.
[1:28:20] And and Satan has false lights
[1:28:22] and we need to be vigilant, be sober.
[1:28:26] The our our adversary, the devil, he's
[1:28:28] walking around seeking whom he may
[1:28:30] devour.
[1:28:31] It's a it's a it's a real thing.
[1:28:34] We know the the light of the devil bears
[1:28:37] the light that came from God because the
[1:28:39] Bible says that he made him that way.
[1:28:43] So, he carries a light that God gave
[1:28:46] him. But understand, it's perverted now.
[1:28:49] Amen.
[1:28:49] And that light is mixed with darkness.
[1:28:52] And sometimes it's bright and sometimes
[1:28:55] it's gray.
[1:28:58] And sometimes it's black.
[1:29:02] And only the elect of God will recognize
[1:29:07] it.
[1:29:07] Amen.
[1:29:10] You know, I was looking for a white tie
[1:29:12] and in my closet, I need to get some of
[1:29:15] these lights in my closet. That's what I
[1:29:17] need to do. I pulled out one of my ties
[1:29:20] and it looked white, but it wasn't quite
[1:29:22] white white. It was, I don't know, bone
[1:29:26] or off-white or whatever them those
[1:29:29] colors are, but it was just enough to
[1:29:32] where it looked white, but it wasn't
[1:29:33] white.
[1:29:35] And obviously if it was black I would
[1:29:39] have recognized that is not the tie I'm
[1:29:41] looking for today.
[1:29:43] So it's when it gets so close
[1:29:47] that it's hard to tell
[1:29:49] that's where you need to be in the
[1:29:52] spirit.
[1:29:53] That's where you need to be close with
[1:29:55] God.
[1:29:55] Amen.
[1:29:57] Because the devil will certainly try to
[1:30:00] trick you. First Kings 18:21 Elijah came
[1:30:03] unto the people and said, "How long will
[1:30:07] you halt between two opinions?
[1:30:10] If the Lord be God, follow him. If Baal,
[1:30:12] then follow him." And the people
[1:30:15] answered him, "Not a word." What is
[1:30:17] that? Come to church. Won't say amen.
[1:30:22] Won't say it like it is.
[1:30:24] How long you going to haul? Is the word
[1:30:26] the word? Is what we're preaching the
[1:30:28] truth or isn't it?
[1:30:30] We have two spirits. One there's there's
[1:30:35] no darkness at all. And the other one is
[1:30:37] a mixture of light and darkness.
[1:30:40] And sometimes we're halting between the
[1:30:42] two lights, two opinions, two attitudes.
[1:30:45] And we don't want to answer a word.
[1:30:49] God is choosing us to take a stand. We
[1:30:52] need to choose daily what light we're
[1:30:54] going to follow, what attitude we're
[1:30:55] going to have, what light we're going to
[1:30:57] step into. Are we going to be true blue
[1:30:59] or we just going to act like it? You
[1:31:01] know, we're good at acting.
[1:31:04] We're better at acting than living.
[1:31:07] Come on.
[1:31:08] We don't want to hurt somebody. We don't
[1:31:09] want to offend somebody.
[1:31:12] We want to give us excuses.
[1:31:15] Just be you.
[1:31:17] Be genuine.
[1:31:20] Let the chips fall where they're going
[1:31:21] to fall.
[1:31:25] Joshua 24:15 says, "And and if it seem
[1:31:29] evil unto you to serve the Lord, then
[1:31:31] choose you this day whom you serve,
[1:31:33] whether it's the gods of your fathers
[1:31:35] that served on the other side of the
[1:31:36] flood, or the gods of the Amorites in
[1:31:38] whose land you dwell, but for me in my
[1:31:40] house, we will serve the Lord."
[1:31:44] Joshua chose to walk in the light of
[1:31:47] God,
[1:31:48] right?
[1:31:49] He chose to make sure that his house
[1:31:53] was going to be walking as servants of
[1:31:55] God.
[1:31:57] And you don't just say, "Well, this is
[1:31:59] what we're going to do." Put the plaque
[1:32:01] up on the wall and say, "Oh, yeah. Yeah,
[1:32:04] we're Christians." Every day,
[1:32:07] we're going to be tempted. Devil's going
[1:32:10] to try to pull us away from serving all
[1:32:14] light to serve some light.
[1:32:17] Amen. and some darkness.
[1:32:19] Are you with me?
[1:32:21] So, we need to choose, make the choice
[1:32:23] to walk in the light as God is shining
[1:32:26] away from you. Jesus said, "I have many
[1:32:29] things to shine into your life.
[1:32:33] Many things I want to say to you, but
[1:32:35] you can't bear it now. How be it, when
[1:32:37] the Holy Spirit is come inside of you,
[1:32:41] he's going to do it. He's going to tell
[1:32:44] you because you can bear it. and he will
[1:32:46] guide you into all truth. Notice all
[1:32:49] truth. If you are in all truth, then
[1:32:51] you're in no darkness.
[1:32:57] Now, you got to remember this. If it's
[1:32:59] just here, all you got to do is have all
[1:33:02] the truth here, then you know what?
[1:33:05] Satan is going to make it
[1:33:08] because Satan has all the truth up here.
[1:33:13] He's got so much truth. He was preaching
[1:33:15] it to Jesus.
[1:33:20] It balam I mean
[1:33:24] it it's not the knowledge of the truth.
[1:33:27] It's the manifestation in flesh. Jesus
[1:33:30] Christ the same yesterday, today, and
[1:33:32] forever.
[1:33:33] Amen.
[1:33:34] For this was the son of manifested that
[1:33:37] he might destroy the works of the devil.
[1:33:39] And when Christ is manifested in your
[1:33:41] life, it'll destroy the the devil in
[1:33:43] your life. If it's the only thing
[1:33:45] that'll destroy the devil in your life
[1:33:46] is when you manifest Christ.
[1:33:49] The only thing
[1:33:52] you can't just say
[1:33:56] Jesus who Paul preaches
[1:33:59] amen.
[1:34:01] It's got to be for me in my house.
[1:34:03] Amen.
[1:34:04] Me in my house.
[1:34:07] John 8:31.
[1:34:11] And then Jesus said to those Jews which
[1:34:13] believed on him, "If you continue in my
[1:34:17] word,"
[1:34:18] in other words, if you continue to walk
[1:34:20] in more light, more light, then you're
[1:34:24] my disciples indeed.
[1:34:26] Yes.
[1:34:28] We don't continue to walk in the old
[1:34:30] light. We don't keep getting baptized
[1:34:31] every week,
[1:34:33] right? We're not laying again the the
[1:34:36] foundation,
[1:34:37] right? We're walking in more light.
[1:34:40] then are you my disciples indeed and you
[1:34:42] shall know the truth and the truth shall
[1:34:44] make you free. That word means to to to
[1:34:47] deliver to liberate.
[1:34:49] Right?
[1:34:50] So stand fast therefore in the liberty
[1:34:52] where Christ has made us free. Preserve
[1:34:56] the freedom that Christ has given you
[1:34:58] and be not entangled again with the yoke
[1:35:02] of bondage.
[1:35:04] Don't go back to that.
[1:35:06] Be not entangled again. Now, what that
[1:35:09] means, that word entangled, if you look
[1:35:11] it up in this Greek, it means
[1:35:16] to don't hold on to something.
[1:35:19] Don't hold on to something. Just let it
[1:35:21] go. Don't become ins snared. Don't keep
[1:35:25] a grudge. Don't have an urge to set
[1:35:29] something straight with somebody.
[1:35:31] Don't have a quarrel with someone. That
[1:35:34] includes the word of God. Amen.
[1:35:36] Thank go the word of God. Be not
[1:35:39] entangled again with what? The yoke of
[1:35:43] bondage.
[1:35:48] I I think we ought to be just like um
[1:35:54] walking around praising God
[1:35:58] because it's Satan's job to get you
[1:36:01] entangled.
[1:36:04] You you've been set free. your sins are
[1:36:06] forgiven, but then get entangled
[1:36:09] and then you don't got victory.
[1:36:12] Then it's hard to press in. It's hard to
[1:36:14] have a a good attitude, hard to come ex
[1:36:17] with it with expectation, hard to have
[1:36:19] faith because you're entangled again.
[1:36:23] And and only you can stand fast in the
[1:36:25] liberty where Christ has made you free.
[1:36:28] Ephesians 5 verse one, we're getting
[1:36:31] ready to close here.
[1:36:35] We had to do a baby dedication so we got
[1:36:36] a little bit more time this morning.
[1:36:40] Amen. We have certainly appreciate
[1:36:41] seeing brother Ferguson, his lovely
[1:36:44] family. I'll say from the bottom of my
[1:36:46] heart, from the bottom of the heart of
[1:36:48] the church, we have missed you.
[1:36:50] We have so missed you.
[1:36:52] Appreciate uh Brother Bruce and uh
[1:36:57] Brother Ron mentioning you in in prayer
[1:36:59] so often.
[1:37:02] Ephesians 5:1, "Be ye therefore
[1:37:05] followers of God as dear children,
[1:37:09] and walk in love, as Christ also have
[1:37:12] loved us, and given himself for us an
[1:37:14] offering and a sacrifice to God for a
[1:37:17] sweet smelling savor." And let no man
[1:37:21] deceive you with vain words. That means
[1:37:23] empty words, no substance, no meanings,
[1:37:25] can't count on it. Let no man deceive
[1:37:27] you with those words. For because of
[1:37:29] these things, because of these things,
[1:37:32] these vain words, cometh the wrath of
[1:37:35] God upon the children of disputes. Now,
[1:37:38] I'm sorry, I went to verse six. Okay, so
[1:37:40] there's a obviously a number of things
[1:37:42] that can deceive us.
[1:37:48] So, let no man deceive you with vain
[1:37:50] words. In other words, look at the life,
[1:37:52] right? Jesus said, "By their fruit you
[1:37:53] shall know them. For because of these
[1:37:56] things cometh the wrath of God." God who
[1:37:57] has it come upon children who do not
[1:38:00] walk in the light.
[1:38:02] Children of disobedience. He said, "Be
[1:38:04] not ye therefore partakers with them.
[1:38:08] For ye yourselves sometimes darkness,
[1:38:11] for ye were sometimes darkness, but now
[1:38:14] are ye light in the Lord."
[1:38:19] Can you say amen?
[1:38:21] So what do we do with that statement?
[1:38:23] Walk as children of light.
[1:38:28] You are light in Christ. Now walk in the
[1:38:33] light.
[1:38:34] Amen.
[1:38:37] Now, we don't just say, "I'm in the
[1:38:40] light."
[1:38:42] When
[1:38:44] if you as soon as you offend somebody,
[1:38:46] you do something wrong, you should just
[1:38:48] quickly say, "I'm sorry."
[1:38:51] It's walking in the light.
[1:38:54] It's walking in the light.
[1:38:57] You got to constantly walk in the light.
[1:39:00] We don't walk in the light. You know,
[1:39:01] the prophet taught us we don't walk in
[1:39:03] the light of a past age. He said,
[1:39:05] "We walk in the light of this age.
[1:39:07] There's new light that has come." Well,
[1:39:10] we're all doing something different.
[1:39:12] Like, if I could say it like this,
[1:39:15] somebody in this room is going to sin
[1:39:18] the most today after we leave here.
[1:39:23] And somebody is going to sin the less.
[1:39:32] But we all have to do one thing.
[1:39:35] We all have to say sorry.
[1:39:39] Mean it from our heart.
[1:39:42] Plead the blood of Christ
[1:39:45] and show our appreciation. How? By
[1:39:47] walking in the light.
[1:39:54] So as God shines that light and he says,
[1:39:57] "Okay, you shouldn't have said that. You
[1:39:58] shouldn't have acted like that. Quickly
[1:40:01] make that right. Don't let the sun go
[1:40:02] down upon your wrath. Make things right
[1:40:05] and walk in the light."
[1:40:07] Amen.
[1:40:08] Because God is calling us to walk in the
[1:40:11] light. Be not therefore partakers with
[1:40:14] him. For ye were sometimes darkness, but
[1:40:17] now are ye light in the Lord. Whereas
[1:40:19] walk as children of light. Verse 9. For
[1:40:23] the fruit of the spirit is in all
[1:40:24] goodness and righteousness, proving what
[1:40:27] is acceptable unto the Lord. Proving
[1:40:30] what is acceptable unto the Lord. Verse
[1:40:32] 11. And have no fellowship
[1:40:37] with the unfruitful works of darkness.
[1:40:42] But rather
[1:40:44] reprove them.
[1:40:47] Take a stand.
[1:40:50] Don't get entangled again. Take a stand.
[1:40:55] Let's drop down to verse 14. Wherefore
[1:40:57] he saith, "Awake thou that sleepest, and
[1:41:00] arise from the dead, and Christ shall
[1:41:02] give thee light." Notice that if you
[1:41:05] want light, wake up. Right?
[1:41:09] No. Brother Brandon said it like this.
[1:41:10] God is not a obligated to give you any
[1:41:14] more truth.
[1:41:17] until you walk in the truth that he's
[1:41:19] already given you.
[1:41:22] So you want more truth, then we we wake
[1:41:25] up.
[1:41:26] We wake up and we do what we know we
[1:41:28] should be doing first
[1:41:30] and then God will bring you up higher.
[1:41:32] God will give you more revelation. God
[1:41:34] will get you closer to him. Yeah. Yeah.
[1:41:40] We just got to have the attitude of
[1:41:43] walking in the light that he's given us
[1:41:46] before we can walk in new light. Verse
[1:41:50] 15, see then that you walk
[1:41:52] circumspectly, not as fools, but as
[1:41:54] wise, redeeming the time, because the
[1:41:56] days are evil. Wherefore be not unwise,
[1:41:59] but understanding what the will of the
[1:42:01] Lord is. And it is the will of God for
[1:42:03] us to walk in the light that God is
[1:42:05] shining over there away from us. Always
[1:42:08] understand when somebody comes to you
[1:42:10] and says, "Oh, you shouldn't have said.
[1:42:12] Why did you say this? Why? What's
[1:42:13] happening here?" Somebody's, you know,
[1:42:15] questioning you about what's going on.
[1:42:18] You know what that could be? That could
[1:42:19] be God speaking to you.
[1:42:22] Amen.
[1:42:25] And and and you were in darkness and
[1:42:27] God's trying to get you to walk in that
[1:42:29] light. And if you walk in the light,
[1:42:32] you'll meet God there
[1:42:34] because God is in his word. Let's stand
[1:42:35] together. God bless you. There's many
[1:42:38] examples in the Bible where people chose
[1:42:40] not to walk in the light. The rich young
[1:42:42] ruler chose not to walk in the light.
[1:42:45] The children of Israel, they decided not
[1:42:47] to continue to walk in the light. They
[1:42:49] came out of Egypt, they rejoiced, but
[1:42:51] they didn't continue to walk in the
[1:42:53] light. God is trying to lead us into a
[1:42:56] rapture.
[1:42:58] And we're not going to get to the
[1:42:59] rapture. We're not going to get to that
[1:43:01] until we take the next step. And the
[1:43:04] next step may be just be more faithful.
[1:43:08] Be more faithful.
[1:43:10] When God is shining the light away from
[1:43:13] you, that is him calling you to walk in
[1:43:16] the light where he is at.
[1:43:25] If we receive the knowledge
[1:43:28] of the word,
[1:43:32] remember
[1:43:34] that is the same light that Satan has.
[1:43:37] He has the He has the knowledge of the
[1:43:39] word. He has that light. But in him,
[1:43:42] it's made with darkness.
[1:43:44] Amen.
[1:43:44] But God's bride
[1:43:47] is light without darkness.
[1:43:49] Amen. That's Christ. Amen. How many How
[1:43:53] many loves the Lord today?
[1:43:56] I'm wondering if our um AC's not
[1:44:00] working. I'm wondering some of you that
[1:44:02] are always cold, you're probably
[1:44:03] rejoicing.
[1:44:08] Amen. Can we sing? We'll walk in the
[1:44:11] light.
[1:44:13] Walk in the light.
[1:44:17] All ye saints
[1:44:21] of light proclaim
[1:44:25] Jesus the light of the world.
[1:44:33] Life and mercy
[1:44:36] in his name.
[1:44:40] Jesus the light of the world
[1:44:47] will walk in the light.
[1:44:51] The beautiful
[1:44:54] light
[1:44:56] come where the dew drops of mercy are
[1:45:01] bright.
[1:45:03] Shine all around us by day and by night.
[1:45:10] Jesus the light of the world.
[1:45:18] Hear the Savior's
[1:45:21] earnest
[1:45:23] call.
[1:45:25] Jesus the light of the world.
[1:45:32] Send the goel
[1:45:36] truth to all.
[1:45:39] Jesus the light of the world.
[1:45:47] We'll give the light
[1:45:50] the beautiful
[1:45:52] light.
[1:45:54] Come where the dew drops of mercy are
[1:45:59] proud.
[1:46:01] Shine all around us by day and by night.
[1:46:08] Jesus the light of the world.
[1:46:16] Why not seek him then today?
[1:46:23] Jesus the light of the world.
[1:46:30] Go with truth the narrow
[1:46:35] way.
[1:46:37] Jesus the light of the world.
[1:46:43] We'll walk in the light,
[1:46:47] the beautiful
[1:46:49] light.
[1:46:51] Come where the dew drops of mercy are
[1:46:56] bright.
[1:46:58] Shine all around us by day and by night.
[1:47:05] Jesus the light of the world.
[1:47:12] Come confess
[1:47:15] him as your king.
[1:47:19] Jesus the light of the world.
[1:47:26] And the bells of heaven will ring.
[1:47:33] Jesus the light of the world
[1:47:40] will walk in the light.
[1:47:43] The beautiful
[1:47:45] lights
[1:47:47] come where the dew drops of mercy are
[1:47:52] bright.
[1:47:54] Shine all around us by day and by night.
[1:48:01] Jesus the light of the world.
[1:48:09] Amen. We have a north star.
[1:48:13] Amen. We have a light. We have a word to
[1:48:16] guide us to walk more closer to him.
[1:48:20] Amen.
[1:48:21] Amen.
[1:48:23] Amen. Let's bow our heart in a word of
[1:48:25] prayer.
[1:48:27] Maybe there'd be someone today,
[1:48:30] every head bow, every eye closed. Maybe
[1:48:33] there'd be someone here today say,
[1:48:35] "Brother John, this word dealt with me
[1:48:39] today.
[1:48:41] I believe God is calling me to become
[1:48:44] more serious about walking into the
[1:48:46] light and not taking certain things for
[1:48:49] granted." and
[1:48:53] and you just want to accept his word
[1:48:56] today into your heart and you want to
[1:48:59] dedicate
[1:49:01] yourself to walking in the light of the
[1:49:03] word
[1:49:05] and
[1:49:08] you want to grow with Christ in this the
[1:49:11] light of what you heard today. You want
[1:49:12] to be remembered and purged. Just lift
[1:49:14] your hands. I want to pray with this
[1:49:16] group of people today. Amen. And God
[1:49:19] bless all these hands. How beautiful.
[1:49:21] How wonderful. Let's just let's just
[1:49:24] believe now. I believe that God is he's
[1:49:28] given us his word. You have responded to
[1:49:31] the word
[1:49:32] and I believe that God is going to do
[1:49:35] something for us. Amen. and our heavenly
[1:49:38] father. Lord, we come to you humbly as
[1:49:43] your prophet taught us
[1:49:46] as nothing
[1:49:48] knowing Lord it is you that opens our
[1:49:52] eyes to what light really is.
[1:49:56] And God
[1:49:58] today
[1:50:00] we have sincere hearts. We've lifted our
[1:50:03] hands.
[1:50:05] We've received the engrafted word which
[1:50:07] is able to save our souls.
[1:50:10] Then Lord, we want to walk in the light
[1:50:14] as you shine it a away from us to to to
[1:50:19] walk towards and to get into it to be
[1:50:21] where you want us to be. And when we're
[1:50:23] there, Lord, we know that light's going
[1:50:25] to shine again and and draw us to a
[1:50:28] higher, closer walk with you. Father, I
[1:50:31] pray for your bride here. I pray for
[1:50:34] every hand that was lifted, Lord, that
[1:50:37] you are calling close to you. I pray
[1:50:41] that you would give them grace to
[1:50:43] fulfill the very desires of their heart
[1:50:46] to walk with you, Lord. That you would
[1:50:48] give them strength to put aside the
[1:50:51] things that they need to put aside. They
[1:50:53] could say no to darkness. They could say
[1:50:55] yes to light. Lord, give every one of
[1:50:58] them keen eyes to recognize that the
[1:51:01] enemy when he comes with his light that
[1:51:04] it's mixed with darkness as you promised
[1:51:06] in your word that your elect would not
[1:51:08] be deceived. Lord, I pray bless each and
[1:51:12] every one. Father, may we be ready in
[1:51:15] that hour that's so soon approaching us.
[1:51:18] Lord, help us to take advantage of every
[1:51:21] time the doors are open, Lord, to
[1:51:23] forsake not the assembling of ourselves
[1:51:26] together, all the more as we see the day
[1:51:28] approaching, knowing, Lord, that this is
[1:51:30] the place, Lord, that you said that
[1:51:32] you'd meet your people in this area,
[1:51:34] Father. Lord, we thank you for this
[1:51:37] lighthouse. We thank you that you've
[1:51:39] that there is a place that we can come,
[1:51:41] that you're the message of the hours is
[1:51:44] preached, Lord, and that it is believed.
[1:51:47] and Lord that it is here to give light
[1:51:49] to the bride to make them ready for
[1:51:51] rapture. And I pray Lord that it could
[1:51:53] become stronger and that our whole lives
[1:51:55] could become brighter and that we could
[1:51:57] become brighter and brighter and that
[1:52:00] what darkness Lord is in our life would
[1:52:02] would leave us and Lord that we would
[1:52:04] become more like you in your image.
[1:52:06] Grant it Lord I pray you would bless
[1:52:08] your people now in the name of Jesus
[1:52:11] Christ. Bless them Lord. God for your
[1:52:14] prophets said it is the greatest thing
[1:52:15] that we could say to one another is God
[1:52:18] bless you. Lord in your name Lord we
[1:52:21] bless your people in your name today.
[1:52:23] Lord, we count this message today, Lord,
[1:52:26] a help, a blessing, a strength, Lord, a
[1:52:30] a an encouragement even to your people
[1:52:33] today, Father.
