[38:43] some question

[38:50] you are a heavenly father

[40:12] lord just use them for your honor and
[40:14] glory we love you
[40:16] thank you for these things ask your
[40:18] blessings now
[40:20] in jesus precious name we pray amen
[40:24] amen genesis chapter 2 starting with
[40:27] verse number 21
[40:28] and the lord god caused a deep
[40:31] sleep to fall upon adam
[40:36] and he slept and he took one
[40:39] of his ribs and closed up the flesh
[40:42] instead
[40:43] thereof and the rib which the lord god
[40:46] had taken from man
[40:48] made he a woman and brought her un
[40:51] to the man and adam said this is now
[40:55] bone of my bones and flesh of my flesh
[40:58] she shall be called
[41:00] woman because she was taken out
[41:04] of man amen and then chapter 2
[41:08] verse number 20 i mean chapter 3 right
[41:11] over
[41:12] chapter 3 verse number 20 and adam
[41:15] called his wife and
[41:18] and adam called his wife's name eve
[41:22] because she was the mother of all living
[41:26] amen amen god bless you may be seated
[41:33] the dictionary definition of a mother
[41:38] is a female who has given birth
[41:42] to offspring amen
[41:48] and i don't care how much a man wants to
[41:50] be a woman these days
[41:53] or how much he wants to act like a woman
[41:55] or how he may change his physical
[41:58] or autonomy of his body to match that of
[42:01] a woman
[42:02] he will never be able to bring forth
[42:04] offspring
[42:05] like a woman amen
[42:09] because that's what god that god created
[42:12] her that way
[42:14] to bring forth offspring
[42:17] you're something in the nature of a
[42:19] woman
[42:20] to be a mother brother brenham said
[42:24] but does it that it if she doesn't
[42:27] mother a child she'll most likely want
[42:29] to mother a dog or a cat or some animal
[42:32] right it's just in the nature that god
[42:35] created in
[42:36] her to mother something
[42:39] and we see it manifested even in an
[42:42] early age
[42:44] as most of you know we we had five girls
[42:47] we have five girls and
[42:49] when they were young
[42:53] we often witnessed them mothering
[42:56] adoles a baby doll just being a real
[43:00] mother to them it's the cutest thing
[43:04] it was so cute their their
[43:07] instinct inside of them is to cuddle and
[43:10] to hold them to feed them
[43:13] to to bottle them they literally
[43:15] eventually came up with
[43:17] dowels that you could put water in them
[43:19] and the water would come out and they
[43:21] better change the diapers and they feel
[43:23] you know like but they would put cute
[43:26] outfits on them and
[43:28] put matching bowls they'd comb their
[43:31] hair and
[43:32] put matching hair clips in braid their
[43:34] hair sometimes and
[43:36] they'd sing songs and uh rock with them
[43:39] and
[43:40] rock them to sleep and then once they
[43:42] put them down this feet they never went
[43:44] back to see if they ever got up they
[43:46] were done playing at the time
[43:48] [Laughter]
[43:52] but they they loved to mother
[43:55] of course at that moment in their life
[43:57] they didn't realize what it takes to
[43:59] really
[43:59] mother a child
[44:03] yet her instinct only appealed
[44:06] to the part of mothering that brings
[44:09] pleasure
[44:10] and self-gratification that's why they
[44:12] were doing it
[44:15] and it's really no different for some
[44:17] mothers with children
[44:19] they only want a child so they can
[44:23] mother like a doll
[44:26] they're interested in the part of
[44:28] mothering that brings pleasure
[44:30] to themselves and self-gratification but
[44:33] have no idea
[44:35] what they're getting into they don't
[44:38] understand the necessary part
[44:41] of of doing things that does not bring
[44:44] pleasure
[44:45] that's still a part of mothering amen
[44:48] it's a pain-wrenching responsibility
[44:52] that can bring the worst out of a mother
[44:56] it can make a mother yell and scream and
[44:58] cry and beg for help with her child
[45:00] yes amen for some to the point that they
[45:04] before that baby is even born they want
[45:06] to abort the idea
[45:07] right yeah but a good mother
[45:11] is willing to take that pain wrenching
[45:13] responsibility
[45:14] of all their nonsense to see their child
[45:16] through
[45:18] to grow up to be a mature
[45:22] lady or son
[45:25] someday amen a good mother
[45:28] wants their children to listen to them
[45:31] any good mother would want that
[45:33] to follow their example and to be like
[45:35] them
[45:37] i was always i was raised mainly
[45:40] by a single parent my dad
[45:44] and i always question when he said to me
[45:47] do as i tell you to do not as i do
[45:53] he wanted to cover the bases
[45:57] but a good mother wants their child to
[46:00] think like them and to believe like
[46:02] these so they can make the right
[46:03] decisions in school and not get mixed up
[46:05] in the wrong things
[46:07] wants to be a perfect example for them
[46:10] we could say that
[46:10] a good mother would want their children
[46:13] to be brought up in the way that they
[46:14] should go
[46:18] now as a mother you can teach your
[46:20] children a lot of things
[46:22] but the most important thing that you
[46:24] can do as a mother is to teach them
[46:26] about jesus christ amen for jesus christ
[46:30] is the creator of who they
[46:32] are he is the giver of life
[46:36] of of them and to teach your child
[46:39] where they came from is the greatest
[46:41] thing that you could do
[46:42] because nowadays people grow up and they
[46:44] don't know who they are they're trying
[46:46] to find their identity
[46:47] trying to find what they belong to who
[46:49] are they right amen
[46:53] but when we can have a revelation that
[46:55] we will our our creator is jesus christ
[46:58] we belong to god it brings a stability
[47:01] and a foundation to our lives amen
[47:04] amen nothing's more important than the
[47:07] will of god
[47:10] deuteronomy chapter 6 verse 5 says and
[47:12] thou shalt love the lord thy god
[47:15] with all thy heart and with all thy soul
[47:18] and with all thy might
[47:19] amen and these words which i command
[47:21] thee this day
[47:23] shall be in thine heart right amen and
[47:26] thou shall teach them
[47:27] diligently unto thy children and shall
[47:30] talk of them
[47:31] when thou sittest down in thy house and
[47:33] when thou walk is by the way
[47:35] and when the lie is down when that rises
[47:37] up it sounds like quite often
[47:39] we need to spend time teaching our
[47:42] children
[47:44] the ways of the lord
[47:47] and thou shalt bind them for a sign upon
[47:50] thine hand and thou shall
[47:52] they shall be as frontlets between thine
[47:54] eyes and thou
[47:55] shall write them on the pulse of the
[47:57] house and on the gates
[47:58] everywhere that our children
[48:02] go they need to see the love of god in
[48:05] our lives because if we don't give them
[48:07] god
[48:07] they will never find the chances of them
[48:09] finding god are not very good because
[48:11] my neighbor doesn't really care
[48:16] the people at school don't really care
[48:18] the people at work just don't care
[48:22] it's not a bad thing to share jesus with
[48:25] our children
[48:27] amen now i know if you all feel like
[48:31] i do we feel like we failed as parents
[48:37] it's a real predominant emotional
[48:41] feeling
[48:44] but it is impossible
[48:48] to bring forth a perfect child
[48:54] it is impossible to be a perfect parent
[48:59] it doesn't matter to what extreme that
[49:02] you go to
[49:04] um children have to make their own
[49:07] decisions at their own time and go
[49:09] through the experiences that they go
[49:11] through
[49:14] in our little nest
[49:18] uh all my all of our
[49:22] sorry cheryl all of our little children
[49:25] uh they were all in the same nest
[49:33] we didn't have different nests
[49:36] we all had bible studies together we all
[49:38] eight together all have the same rules
[49:43] they all chose different paths yes
[49:49] and so we can't ever ever beat ourselves
[49:53] up
[49:53] for feeling like we failed as a parent
[49:56] because every parent feels that way
[49:58] in some way or another
[50:01] we have got to trust god that he makes
[50:03] up the difference
[50:04] [Music]
[50:08] not my dad and mom
[50:12] they never taught me the way to go
[50:18] and god found a way yes amen
[50:21] our faith is not in our parents our
[50:23] faith is in god
[50:24] amen
[50:28] now every mother has the hardest job in
[50:30] the world to bring up her children the
[50:32] way they should go
[50:35] we've heard behind every good man was a
[50:38] good mother
[50:42] a mother is always a mother
[50:46] and it seems like her work is never done
[50:50] sometimes the children have told us
[50:54] your work is done stop telling me what
[50:56] to do
[50:59] but there's always a need when you see
[51:01] your children
[51:03] in john chapter 19 verse 26 when jesus
[51:07] saw his mother hanging from the cross
[51:11] that just and the disciples standing by
[51:14] her
[51:14] whom he loved now notice john was the
[51:18] only one that recorded this
[51:20] he saith to his mother woman behold
[51:25] thy son
[51:28] here he was dying
[51:34] and he wanted his mother
[51:39] to take care of john
[51:44] just as if jesus was still going to be
[51:48] living
[51:51] didn't want to feel like something was
[51:54] missing just continue on
[51:59] it's inside of us to take care
[52:05] no matter what happens in life
[52:09] then say if he to his disciple behold
[52:11] thy mother
[52:12] and from that hour that disciple took
[52:15] onto his
[52:16] own took his own took her into his own
[52:18] home
[52:20] now notice john never said oh but jesus
[52:23] i already have a mother
[52:26] he didn't have that attitude and from
[52:29] that
[52:30] hour that disciple took her onto his own
[52:32] home
[52:33] our work isn't complete until god says
[52:37] it's complete we may want to quit
[52:45] god had created man for a purpose
[52:48] he created a woman for a purpose
[52:51] and that purpose was to fulfill his will
[52:56] which is the only way that god ever gets
[52:58] pleasure and gratification
[53:00] amen can you imagine
[53:04] your little girl putting a baby in a
[53:07] stroller and
[53:07] taking her down for a walk down the
[53:10] driveway
[53:12] and that little baby dollar just says
[53:14] hey no way get me out of here ain't
[53:16] doing this
[53:18] not only would it scare her and go what
[53:20] what's going on
[53:23] it would not be fulfilling the will of
[53:26] that little girl
[53:29] the only way that god ever gets pleasure
[53:32] is when we do his will
[53:34] not scream and kick and we want to do
[53:37] our own thing
[53:39] revelations chapter 4 verse 11.
[53:42] it says thou art worthy o lord
[53:47] how many believe the lord is worthy this
[53:48] morning
[53:50] to receive glory and honor and power i
[53:53] believe that's why we need to worship
[53:55] not only in the worship service
[53:56] but as the word is being preached
[53:58] because he is worthy
[54:01] for thou has created all things
[54:05] and for thy pleasure they are
[54:09] and were created so why were you created
[54:14] real simple not a big mystery to bring
[54:16] glory
[54:17] and honor and pleasure to god
[54:24] god wants pleasure from his children
[54:27] colossians chapter 1 verse 16
[54:29] for by him were all things created that
[54:32] are in heaven
[54:33] and that are in earth visible and
[54:35] invisible whether they be thrones
[54:37] dominions
[54:38] principalities or powers it just doesn't
[54:40] matter
[54:41] all things were created by him and
[54:45] for him
[54:50] and he is before all things and by him
[54:52] all things consist and he is the head of
[54:54] the body of the church
[54:55] who is the beginning the firstborn of
[54:56] the dead that in all things
[54:58] he might have the saso
[55:03] he wants to say so he does not
[55:07] want us sitting here in church
[55:11] without him being first in our thoughts
[55:14] and our minds and our hearts he wants
[55:18] the preeminence
[55:21] you ever been sitting down and and
[55:24] uh somebody's sitting next to you and
[55:25] you want a little bit more room
[55:31] how about when two people are wanting to
[55:32] watch something and one wants to watch
[55:34] this and the other ones watch that
[55:37] how about when there's only so much food
[55:39] on the table and one wants
[55:41] somebody's got to get god wants the
[55:43] preeminence
[55:44] he created us nobody is here
[55:48] by chance
[55:51] amen god foresaw this day amen
[55:55] he put us here for a purpose and that
[55:58] purpose was to bring him
[56:00] glory and honor and pleasure and
[56:02] gratification
[56:04] amen now god
[56:08] sets out to have children genesis
[56:10] chapter 1 here
[56:12] verse 26 genesis chapter 1 verse 26
[56:15] and god said let us make man in our own
[56:18] image
[56:20] after our likeness notice not somebody
[56:22] else's image
[56:24] not somebody else's likeness amen he
[56:27] wanted us to be like him
[56:30] and let them have dominion over the fish
[56:33] of the seas and over the fowls of the
[56:34] air and the cattle and over all
[56:36] all the earth and every creeping thing
[56:39] uh that creepeth upon the earth
[56:44] god wanted the man that he made in his
[56:47] image
[56:48] to have a dominion over everything else
[56:52] except god in his will
[56:56] so god created man in his own image the
[56:59] image of god created him male
[57:01] and female created he them
[57:05] so at the time that this original
[57:07] creation
[57:08] was created that man was both male
[57:11] and female it was the only time on earth
[57:16] a man could say or a person could say
[57:19] well i i think i'm a female or i think
[57:22] um i'm not sure
[57:26] yes sir because it's the only time that
[57:29] it
[57:30] it that that man was both that's right
[57:34] but something happened
[57:38] there was a uh uh in our opening
[57:40] scripture but
[57:41] let me first read this genesis chapter
[57:43] five verse one this is the book of the
[57:45] generations of adam
[57:47] in that day that god created man in his
[57:49] likeness
[57:50] in the likeness of god made he him male
[57:54] and female created he them and blessed
[57:56] them
[57:57] and he called their name adam
[58:01] not his name their name adam in the day
[58:04] that they were created
[58:06] amen genesis chapter 2 verse 21 and the
[58:09] lord
[58:09] god caused a deep sleep to fallen at him
[58:13] and he slept and he took one of the ribs
[58:15] and closed up the flesh thereof
[58:17] and the rib which the lord god had taken
[58:19] from man made he a woman and brought her
[58:21] unto the man
[58:23] and adam said this is now bone of my
[58:26] bone flesh my flesh
[58:28] she shall be called woman because she
[58:31] was taken
[58:32] out of man
[58:36] and god took the feminist part
[58:40] of adam and placed it into eve
[58:44] and there was that attraction between
[58:46] man
[58:47] and woman right there there was
[58:50] something
[58:50] there that was associated with him
[58:54] to make them one that when they're
[58:56] separated they they weren't
[58:58] complete they weren't one right amen
[59:02] and then verse 28 of genesis chapter 1
[59:05] and the lord
[59:06] and god blessed them and god said unto
[59:09] them
[59:10] be fruitful be multiply
[59:13] and replenish the earth and subdue it
[59:18] and have dominion over the fish of the
[59:20] sea and the fowls of the air and over
[59:22] every living thing that moveth upon the
[59:23] earth
[59:26] genesis chapter 3 verse 20 and adam
[59:28] called his wife eve
[59:30] because she was the mother of all
[59:33] living
[59:37] god had something in his mind for adam
[59:42] and that was to replenish the earth
[59:46] to be fruitful to multiply that's what
[59:49] he told them to do did he not amen
[59:53] but now here's what we've got to
[59:58] understand
[1:00:00] even though adam
[1:00:04] was like a miniature god he would tell
[1:00:07] the mountains to move and they would
[1:00:08] move
[1:00:11] god did not want adam
[1:00:15] and eve having children outside
[1:00:20] of his will right now
[1:00:25] there should be so many more amen since
[1:00:26] it's a true statement
[1:00:30] god will he wanted them before before i
[1:00:33] wanted to multiply
[1:00:34] but it had to be by god's word
[1:00:38] by the spoken word amen and and not by
[1:00:41] their word
[1:00:52] adam was a very smart man very
[1:00:56] intelligent
[1:00:57] very high iq
[1:01:00] great memory he had to name all those
[1:01:03] animals
[1:01:06] i'd be saying cheryl what'd i name that
[1:01:09] one i forgot
[1:01:13] his mind though was so one with the mind
[1:01:16] of god
[1:01:16] right amen when adam saw this
[1:01:20] four-legged creature walking with a long
[1:01:22] neck he said i'll call him a giraffe
[1:01:26] and god said that's exactly what i was
[1:01:28] thinking about
[1:01:30] yeah yes sir when he saw this fat
[1:01:33] creature
[1:01:36] with a long snout so that's got to be an
[1:01:40] elephant i'll call him an elephant
[1:01:41] and god said that's exactly what was on
[1:01:44] my mind
[1:01:44] amen amen
[1:01:48] because god's thoughts were so much
[1:01:51] higher
[1:01:54] than what we're used to at that moment
[1:01:56] before the fall
[1:01:58] adam had the mind of the lord amen
[1:02:03] it was up there very high
[1:02:07] amen
[1:02:11] everything was beautiful and sublime
[1:02:14] in the garden amen all the decisions
[1:02:17] that adam
[1:02:18] made were right in line with bringing
[1:02:20] pleasure to god
[1:02:22] amen until eve wanted to do something
[1:02:26] that was not in the mind of god
[1:02:29] nor would it bring pleasure to god
[1:02:33] and what was that she wanted to be
[1:02:35] fruitful to multiply
[1:02:36] and replenish the earth without god's
[1:02:39] mind
[1:02:42] without god's authority and without
[1:02:44] god's will
[1:02:46] she wanted to have control of her life
[1:02:49] and make her own decisions and have the
[1:02:52] the children that she wanted to have
[1:02:54] right yeah the way she wanted to have
[1:02:56] she wanted
[1:02:57] to be like god in that sense
[1:03:03] no longer wanted to be created for god's
[1:03:05] pleasure
[1:03:06] but her own pleasure and her own will
[1:03:11] she wanted to have her own baby dow to
[1:03:14] control
[1:03:14] as if she was the creator of that life
[1:03:19] she had her own ideas she wanted your
[1:03:22] own way
[1:03:23] she was deceived into thinking that she
[1:03:25] was going to be just like god
[1:03:27] because that most subtle beasts told her
[1:03:30] said
[1:03:31] he shall be as gods right amen
[1:03:35] amen
[1:03:40] do your own will it's appealing to do
[1:03:44] your own will
[1:03:48] the thing is eve was not created to do
[1:03:50] her own will
[1:03:52] she was created to do the will
[1:03:56] of god amen amen
[1:04:00] not to bring forth and multiply after
[1:04:03] her
[1:04:03] own will but after god's own will right
[1:04:06] amen
[1:04:07] god didn't mess up when he said be
[1:04:09] fruitful multiply
[1:04:12] there was no mistake in that it was just
[1:04:15] how it was to be done
[1:04:23] every man that's born into this world
[1:04:25] outside of jesus christ
[1:04:28] has been born out of god's will
[1:04:35] they were born by the will of flesh
[1:04:38] not by the will of god
[1:04:42] jesus came to the earth as a sacrifice
[1:04:44] for our
[1:04:45] sinful selfish nature that we were born
[1:04:48] with
[1:04:50] we didn't care about god we didn't care
[1:04:52] about pleasing them
[1:04:53] we didn't care about giving gratify if
[1:04:55] we could just fit him in do some little
[1:04:57] thing
[1:04:57] we were probably okay with that and call
[1:04:59] that religion
[1:05:01] but our whole nature was selfish i want
[1:05:04] to do my own thing
[1:05:05] it was no longer so what do you want to
[1:05:07] do when you grow up oh i want to be a
[1:05:08] fireman i want to be a doctor
[1:05:10] i'll tell you so many things i wanted to
[1:05:12] be
[1:05:14] but none of them is i am born to bring
[1:05:17] pleasure
[1:05:19] to my creator none of them were that
[1:05:21] because that's not where my nature was
[1:05:28] he provided a way for us and he let
[1:05:31] us know he let me know he let you know
[1:05:34] he must be born again amen
[1:05:37] you must be born in a way that brings me
[1:05:40] pleasure that brings me gratification
[1:05:42] because how you sit you can't make it
[1:05:44] into heaven
[1:05:46] amen you can't even see the kingdom of
[1:05:48] god you can't understand
[1:05:50] the kingdom of god you need to be born
[1:05:52] again
[1:05:53] the way in my mind that i created adam
[1:05:56] and eve in the beginning
[1:05:57] according to my own image my own will
[1:06:00] you need to be born that way
[1:06:05] john chapter 3 verse 16 for god so
[1:06:09] loved the world that he gave his only
[1:06:11] begotten son
[1:06:13] that whosoever believeth in him should
[1:06:14] not perish
[1:06:16] but have everlasting life amen
[1:06:19] for god sent not his son into the world
[1:06:22] to condemn it that wasn't his purpose
[1:06:25] but that the world through him might be
[1:06:27] saved right
[1:06:28] amen and he that believeth in him is not
[1:06:31] condemned
[1:06:32] but he that believeth not he doesn't
[1:06:34] accept what god has done
[1:06:36] he's already condemned amen
[1:06:39] because you have not believed in the
[1:06:40] name of the only begotten son
[1:06:43] and this is the condemnation that light
[1:06:46] is coming to the world and men
[1:06:50] choose they love darkness
[1:06:53] right rather than light amen
[1:06:57] amen our choice of what we love
[1:07:01] makes the difference
[1:07:04] any person says i'm called i'm like this
[1:07:07] i can't do anything
[1:07:08] i'm stuck i am what i am that's a lie
[1:07:11] from the devil
[1:07:13] we have a choice we have a choice in the
[1:07:15] matter today
[1:07:16] amen amen god did not make robots
[1:07:20] he will not be uh ever uh
[1:07:24] labeled on the other side that uh he
[1:07:28] was someone that made robots that had to
[1:07:29] do for that
[1:07:31] even the angels in heaven that became
[1:07:33] devils he gave him a choice to leave if
[1:07:35] they wanted to
[1:07:43] i'll say today we're set free amen
[1:07:46] choosing to believe in the light
[1:07:48] believing in the love of god believing
[1:07:50] that god
[1:07:51] sent his only son for us
[1:07:56] now we're still instructed today just
[1:07:58] want to bring us today
[1:08:00] we're still instructed today to be
[1:08:02] fruitful to multiply
[1:08:04] and replenish the earth
[1:08:07] but not carnally not trying to bring
[1:08:10] pleasure to ourselves but to god
[1:08:16] now we have to work through a different
[1:08:17] set of circumstances
[1:08:19] but still the same instructions as
[1:08:23] before be fruitful be multiplied and
[1:08:26] replenish the earth
[1:08:29] he told his disciples the very same
[1:08:31] thing when he said come
[1:08:33] and i'll make you fishers of men
[1:08:39] that's right we have a chance to be
[1:08:41] spiritually fruitful
[1:08:44] to multiply and bring forth another
[1:08:46] child
[1:08:47] of god to replenish the earth with sons
[1:08:50] and daughters of god amen
[1:08:56] look in adam both there was male and
[1:08:58] female
[1:09:00] and eve was taken out of adam and god
[1:09:02] put that
[1:09:03] feminist spirit in every
[1:09:06] she became the one that bore the
[1:09:09] children
[1:09:10] the seed from abraham abraham from adam
[1:09:13] excuse me
[1:09:14] today we were in christ
[1:09:17] he took the feminist part out of him
[1:09:20] made us amen amen amen that's right
[1:09:24] that's right amen to bear the children
[1:09:28] amen
[1:09:28] amen it's through us but it's his will
[1:09:32] and then
[1:09:33] it's it's through us but it's his will
[1:09:39] you have not only received the life of
[1:09:41] god in you
[1:09:42] to become his bride but now you are
[1:09:45] carrying
[1:09:46] his seed amen the more you make love to
[1:09:50] god
[1:09:51] the more of seed will be inside of you
[1:09:54] the more of the seed that you have
[1:09:56] inside you the more fruitful you'll be
[1:10:00] the more you'll multiply what's inside
[1:10:02] of you and the more you'll replenish
[1:10:05] those of light precious faith amen
[1:10:08] amen they that win souls is wise
[1:10:12] come follow me and i'll make you fishers
[1:10:15] of men
[1:10:17] that's what he meant when he said go
[1:10:18] yell and multiply
[1:10:21] amen go yelp preach the word
[1:10:24] teach them to do all that i've commanded
[1:10:26] you along with you always
[1:10:27] even to the end amen he shall be
[1:10:30] witnesses of me both in jerusalem judea
[1:10:32] and samaria
[1:10:33] and to other most parts of the earth
[1:10:37] what is that all about it's about
[1:10:39] replenishing
[1:10:41] multiplying bringing four sons and
[1:10:43] daughters of god
[1:10:44] to a spiritual room a spiritual word
[1:10:47] to bringing forth spiritual sons and
[1:10:49] daughters in his own image
[1:10:55] we're all called to be spiritual mothers
[1:11:02] jesus told paul to that he would be
[1:11:05] turning
[1:11:07] many of those that were in darkness to
[1:11:10] light and today we are the people
[1:11:14] who were once in darkness but have come
[1:11:16] into the marvelous light today
[1:11:19] and our job is to spread that light yes
[1:11:22] well that light isn't john martin
[1:11:29] christ and when that light lives in us
[1:11:31] and it's really the light of christ
[1:11:36] he's given each and every one of us his
[1:11:38] seed and we need to go multiply it
[1:11:42] amen turn with me to second corinthians
[1:11:44] chapter 5
[1:11:45] verse 17 when we become born again
[1:11:50] we're born of god's nature to carry out
[1:11:53] his pleasure
[1:11:55] remember that we were created for his
[1:11:57] pleasure
[1:11:58] so somehow we've got to bring pleasure
[1:12:03] then the wonderful thing about those
[1:12:06] babies
[1:12:12] that are our girls mothered
[1:12:15] is that they always did what they told
[1:12:17] them to do
[1:12:21] now once in a while
[1:12:25] something would strike their mind
[1:12:28] and they'd want to whip that baby
[1:12:36] i i just don't know where they got that
[1:12:38] from
[1:12:43] all right second corinthians chapter 5
[1:12:44] verse 17. therefore
[1:12:46] if any man be in christ he is
[1:12:49] something different yes amen
[1:12:52] not the same person he's a new creature
[1:12:55] old things are passed away
[1:12:57] behold all things are become new amen
[1:13:01] and this new describing this new thing
[1:13:06] it's all about god yes all things are of
[1:13:09] god
[1:13:10] now amen who has reconciled
[1:13:13] us to himself by jesus christ
[1:13:16] and has given to us the ministry
[1:13:19] of reconciliation now what do we do is
[1:13:22] that just between me and god
[1:13:27] did god tell adam and eve just stay as
[1:13:30] you are don't multiply
[1:13:32] just it's all about you and me
[1:13:35] no there was something inside of him
[1:13:37] that wanted them
[1:13:38] wanted them to multiply and have a
[1:13:40] family
[1:13:42] god wants a family he hasn't changed
[1:13:46] he's the same yesterday today and
[1:13:49] forever amen
[1:13:51] to wit that god was in christ
[1:13:53] reconciling the world unto himself not
[1:13:55] imputing their trespasses
[1:13:56] unto them and it's committed unto
[1:14:00] us the word of reconciliation
[1:14:03] yes the ministry and the word amen
[1:14:06] now then we are ambassadors for christ
[1:14:10] as though god did beseech you by us we
[1:14:12] pray you in christ said
[1:14:14] be reconciled back to god amen
[1:14:18] that's our ministry
[1:14:23] now god has given that to every man that
[1:14:26] is a new creature
[1:14:29] amen now he even when peter
[1:14:32] and andrew and james and bartholomew and
[1:14:36] matthew and john when they were all
[1:14:39] chosen
[1:14:40] by jesus to be fishers of men
[1:14:45] he did not allow them to start
[1:14:48] that ministry until after they received
[1:14:51] his spirit
[1:14:55] in fact he gave them a warning tarry
[1:14:58] here
[1:14:58] until you be endue with power from on
[1:15:01] high amen
[1:15:02] then you shall be witnesses for
[1:15:09] it's me only way you can be a proper
[1:15:11] witness amen
[1:15:12] is when god witnesses himself it's
[1:15:15] they're going to hear it from the
[1:15:16] horse's mouth then
[1:15:19] that's right because my mouth is just
[1:15:21] going to fail
[1:15:23] my mouth is going to be next
[1:15:31] we're just humans we fail
[1:15:37] this morning i said are you ready to cut
[1:15:39] my hair
[1:15:41] to my lovely wife
[1:15:48] i said you said you were going to cut it
[1:15:50] before sunday
[1:15:55] she says i know i lied
[1:16:02] but when god does the witnessing god
[1:16:05] cannot lie
[1:16:06] amen he's a true witness amen that's why
[1:16:10] we need the holy ghost
[1:16:11] amen you cannot spend too much time
[1:16:14] seeking the holy ghost
[1:16:16] too much time knocking too much time
[1:16:18] asking amen
[1:16:20] but you can spend too little right
[1:16:24] you can be guilty of too little amen you
[1:16:27] cannot put too much assurance
[1:16:29] in getting more of the holy ghost
[1:16:33] this ministry that god has given to us
[1:16:35] will yield more
[1:16:36] children of god this ministry of
[1:16:40] reconciliation
[1:16:41] that he's given it will yield more
[1:16:43] children of god
[1:16:44] it will multiply children of god
[1:16:52] i'd like to talk about an example of
[1:16:55] bringing forth children of god as his
[1:16:57] bride
[1:16:58] being a spiritual mother and teaching
[1:17:00] god's children to love the lord their
[1:17:02] god with all their hearts
[1:17:04] turn with me if you would to first
[1:17:05] corinthians chapter 4 verse 5
[1:17:08] 15. first corinthians chapter 4 verse
[1:17:10] verse 15.
[1:17:11] just want to talk a little bit about an
[1:17:14] example
[1:17:14] of bringing forth children of god as his
[1:17:17] bride amen
[1:17:19] for though we have ten thousand
[1:17:22] instructors in christ
[1:17:25] yet have ye not many fathers
[1:17:29] for in christ jesus i have begotten you
[1:17:34] through the gospel
[1:17:37] i have begotten you through the gospel
[1:17:42] the word begotten here means
[1:17:46] regenerate or
[1:17:50] procreate of the father
[1:17:53] but by the extension of the mother you
[1:17:56] go look that up
[1:18:03] we're just the extension of god he
[1:18:06] places his seed in us
[1:18:07] we share it with another heart they
[1:18:10] receive that word
[1:18:12] when they receive that word you are
[1:18:14] giving birth
[1:18:18] to that new life amen that's being
[1:18:20] changed
[1:18:22] you are building with god
[1:18:25] the kingdom of god amen you are part of
[1:18:28] the winning souls
[1:18:30] is wise yes it's all god but you're
[1:18:33] letting god use your body
[1:18:35] your mouth your mind your thoughts to
[1:18:37] bring forth more
[1:18:38] children of god
[1:18:43] paul was saying here i've begotten you
[1:18:45] i've regenerated i've
[1:18:47] procreated you through the gospel
[1:18:50] wherefore i beseech you be followers of
[1:18:54] me
[1:18:57] not 10 000 instructors in christ
[1:19:03] to help you follow me verse 17 says for
[1:19:06] this cause
[1:19:08] i've sent unto you timotheus
[1:19:11] who is my beloved son now they weren't
[1:19:14] related in the flesh
[1:19:17] gospel but he was a
[1:19:20] faithful in the lord who shall bring you
[1:19:23] into remembrance of my ways
[1:19:26] which be in christ as i teach
[1:19:30] everywhere in every church
[1:19:33] when you thought about paul he was the
[1:19:35] same
[1:19:37] when you think about god he's the same
[1:19:41] when you think about children of god
[1:19:44] they should be the same
[1:19:46] yes different personalities
[1:19:49] sure we've got uh uh different
[1:19:52] attributes
[1:19:53] but god is the same yes the spirit
[1:19:57] of god is the same
[1:20:01] birth is being given spiritually
[1:20:06] god didn't make only one type of tree
[1:20:10] i mean some some trees you can plant and
[1:20:12] they grow like crazy
[1:20:14] fast some they just
[1:20:17] grow so slow they're already growing
[1:20:24] they're all different colors
[1:20:28] but it's the same god the same creator
[1:20:33] that's right children of god are our
[1:20:36] brothers and our sisters
[1:20:40] same family and the integral part that
[1:20:43] we play
[1:20:45] and multiplying the seed of god
[1:20:48] we play a part amen
[1:20:51] just as it happened naturally that's how
[1:20:54] it happens spiritually
[1:20:56] it's just in a spiritual you're no
[1:20:58] longer doing what you want to do
[1:21:00] to bring forth a child
[1:21:08] this morning i gave seven kisses to my
[1:21:10] wife for the seven children we had
[1:21:15] that's naturally but spiritually
[1:21:21] we need to spend time with jesus amen
[1:21:24] receive the seed inside amen so we can
[1:21:28] go share it with somebody
[1:21:29] so it means something who wants to be a
[1:21:33] mother that's just
[1:21:34] it's all about me you were created
[1:21:38] to replenish to multiply
[1:21:42] i love this word what an awesome
[1:21:45] responsibility
[1:21:46] to carry god's seed right inside your
[1:21:49] soul
[1:21:50] amen amen to bear god's seed and to
[1:21:53] watch it multiply
[1:21:54] to let god use you through the gospel to
[1:21:58] regenerate
[1:21:59] the nature of somebody else
[1:22:02] that you have a part to get them to
[1:22:04] think different because we're
[1:22:05] transformed
[1:22:06] amen by the renewing of our mind when
[1:22:08] you can get somebody to think
[1:22:10] differently
[1:22:11] it's okay we're all a salesman or
[1:22:13] something
[1:22:14] right most of the time we're selling
[1:22:16] herself
[1:22:18] but god told paul he says if you well
[1:22:22] god told brother branham if you can get
[1:22:24] the people to believe
[1:22:28] he told paul that it is your job
[1:22:32] to turn the people from darkness onto
[1:22:34] light
[1:22:35] we play a part in our talking and are
[1:22:37] convincing
[1:22:38] amen knowing the
[1:22:42] terror of the lord we persuade
[1:22:45] men persuade the way they think
[1:22:49] because we're interested in bringing
[1:22:51] forth
[1:22:53] the birth of of a son and daughter of
[1:22:56] god in the nature of god in the image of
[1:22:59] god with the
[1:23:00] desire of god amen
[1:23:04] everyone wants to be the bride of christ
[1:23:09] but very few want to receive his seed
[1:23:12] right amen
[1:23:14] it's one thing to want to be the bride
[1:23:16] and it's another to carry his seed
[1:23:19] and to bear children of the gospel amen
[1:23:24] in the message amen running from the
[1:23:26] presence of the lord brother brandon
[1:23:28] says too many
[1:23:29] christians today are soft and everything
[1:23:31] until they
[1:23:32] think all they have to do is just go
[1:23:33] join the church
[1:23:36] go on somewhere put their name on the
[1:23:37] book and do a little something
[1:23:40] maybe somebody they gotta jump up and
[1:23:41] down or something like that and you call
[1:23:44] it christianity
[1:23:49] that's talking about sons and daughters
[1:23:51] now
[1:23:52] he said christianity is an everyday
[1:23:56] rugged life right amen
[1:24:00] i just want you to remember the things
[1:24:03] that are not pleasurous
[1:24:04] about being a christian here
[1:24:08] christianity is an everyday rugged life
[1:24:10] living for god
[1:24:12] in this present world bringing pleasure
[1:24:15] to god
[1:24:16] not ourselves it is a constant
[1:24:20] burning of the fire and the love of god
[1:24:23] in the heart that sets you of fire and
[1:24:26] puts you
[1:24:27] out yonder with people and making
[1:24:30] converts to christ
[1:24:34] he calls this christian responsibility
[1:24:38] we were called to replenish
[1:24:42] to multiply that's right to bring four
[1:24:45] sons and daughters
[1:24:47] that's our reason it's not a choice
[1:24:48] friends
[1:24:51] not to god we
[1:24:54] can say yes or no to it but not
[1:24:56] according to god's will
[1:24:59] i don't think there's been one new
[1:25:02] creature
[1:25:02] that said no i'm not going to do it
[1:25:06] right i believe there's been a lot of
[1:25:09] people who thought they were new
[1:25:10] creatures
[1:25:12] and said i'm not going to do it a lot of
[1:25:15] people have been deceived
[1:25:17] you know the new birth doesn't happen in
[1:25:19] a second
[1:25:21] the complete new birth
[1:25:25] just think it takes nine months for a
[1:25:27] baby to develop
[1:25:28] inside and that whole nine months
[1:25:32] you can shout i've got a baby inside
[1:25:38] it's coming one day it's going to be
[1:25:39] born
[1:25:42] it's going to be just like me it's going
[1:25:45] to look just like me
[1:25:47] and it comes out and it's just
[1:25:48] completely different
[1:25:50] wrong eyes wrong hair what's going on
[1:25:53] sometimes
[1:25:54] no hair and it's a girl and you're
[1:25:57] wondering what's going to happen when
[1:25:58] they buy wigs when they're young
[1:26:07] but eventually through time there sees
[1:26:10] some resemblance
[1:26:13] and you know how the lord is brother
[1:26:15] bruce a lot of parents
[1:26:18] looks just like me doesn't even look
[1:26:20] like me
[1:26:23] a lot of times the lord wants to
[1:26:24] encourage us
[1:26:30] it does not yet appear but we know yes
[1:26:33] we're going to be just like him
[1:26:35] [Music]
[1:26:38] i think it's a beautiful thing for us to
[1:26:39] go to stand and
[1:26:41] and count ourselves as a christian as
[1:26:43] the bride of christ
[1:26:44] even when we fail miserably
[1:26:48] our testimony needs to be i believe yes
[1:26:52] i don't i'm not saying being a hypocrite
[1:26:55] not caring
[1:26:57] but if a righteous man falls seven times
[1:26:59] seven times he'll get back up
[1:27:00] yes we he's only
[1:27:04] is going to act on the profession of our
[1:27:07] faith
[1:27:10] abraham didn't have a child but he
[1:27:13] believed
[1:27:15] he had to believe so long before it
[1:27:16] happened
[1:27:18] can you imagine having to go that long
[1:27:20] on the bride on the bride i'm
[1:27:22] not even acting like the way you should
[1:27:24] but you need to
[1:27:25] you need to be here at church you need
[1:27:27] to be doing everything you can
[1:27:29] to do what the bride does amen
[1:27:37] we need to take the words that are
[1:27:39] preached
[1:27:41] and begin to apply them to our life
[1:27:45] and this word that we're hearing today
[1:27:47] we need to put some emphasis
[1:27:49] in multiplying sons and daughters of god
[1:27:52] that is in your power that is in your
[1:27:54] control you do not say well this i got
[1:27:57] deal with coven i've got so much time
[1:27:58] and i'm working and i can't
[1:28:00] you know it just i don't believe that
[1:28:03] trash
[1:28:06] i'm here god is here amen
[1:28:10] so is the devil and he's given you every
[1:28:14] excuse in the world
[1:28:16] why you don't have to bring forth
[1:28:19] a son and daughter of god amen
[1:28:23] only thing brother brandon said this if
[1:28:26] he could just get
[1:28:26] one man in his hand
[1:28:31] here lord here lord take my life
[1:28:34] use it bring forth a son and daughter
[1:28:37] for you
[1:28:38] amen now well you just
[1:28:42] it's meant to be does it come by my way
[1:28:44] just lay there and just say give it to
[1:28:46] me give it to me
[1:28:50] no no if paul had to get
[1:28:54] if noah had to get all the rotten
[1:28:57] tomatoes and eggs thrown at him for
[1:28:59] 120 years
[1:29:02] if if if paul had to get
[1:29:05] beat up and talked about and
[1:29:08] everything else he had to go through
[1:29:11] just
[1:29:12] to bring forth
[1:29:16] timothy my beloved in the gospel
[1:29:21] i've begotten one soul worth ten
[1:29:24] thousand worlds
[1:29:26] and we don't got time
[1:29:30] come on think about that you know what's
[1:29:32] needed
[1:29:33] we need to spend some time with her
[1:29:36] husband
[1:29:39] not just on the phone hey what's going
[1:29:41] on can you make sure you meet my knees
[1:29:42] my bills are coming
[1:29:43] yeah i mean we need to go
[1:29:46] from the kitchen hearing the gospel
[1:29:53] start having a a a sit down conversation
[1:29:57] in the living room get a little bit more
[1:29:58] in depth about the time that we're
[1:30:00] spending on other things
[1:30:04] and work our way to the bedroom
[1:30:09] we need to receive the seed of god that
[1:30:11] burden for our soul
[1:30:13] [Music]
[1:30:16] i just i just i don't feel i just i've
[1:30:18] just got so many things going
[1:30:20] john you don't understand dr
[1:30:23] jesus can take care of it whatever you
[1:30:26] got going on whatever is so hard
[1:30:27] whatever reason you think it's
[1:30:29] impossible for you to bear a seat of god
[1:30:32] who take care of it right amen
[1:30:36] dr jesus amen
[1:30:40] the friend says it's easy to go the way
[1:30:42] the world goes it's easy
[1:30:43] to flow down the stream
[1:30:46] in other words it's easy not to take on
[1:30:50] the responsibility
[1:30:53] of a hard rugged life winning souls
[1:30:58] most of this world is living
[1:31:01] a hard rugged life barely
[1:31:04] making it through
[1:31:09] but it's not for jesus amen
[1:31:12] they're stuck in their own world they
[1:31:15] don't got time
[1:31:20] it's easy the way the world goes the way
[1:31:22] the world goes it doesn't win souls
[1:31:25] it's not out there trying to win a soul
[1:31:30] just interested in taking care of itself
[1:31:33] their own future
[1:31:40] in other words it's just easy to come to
[1:31:42] church and say i've done my job this
[1:31:45] week
[1:31:50] brother and said you're just floating
[1:31:52] with the world
[1:31:54] easy the way it goes he says you don't
[1:31:57] want to do that no
[1:31:58] sir but you must accept your
[1:32:00] responsibility
[1:32:02] must accept the responsibility what's he
[1:32:04] talking about you must accept that you
[1:32:06] got to get out there
[1:32:08] and start burying children because you
[1:32:09] were called right from the beginning
[1:32:12] to replenish to multiply amen not just
[1:32:15] to get saved and say i'm saved i don't
[1:32:17] have to go to hell that wasn't the plan
[1:32:19] that's what was in it for you but you
[1:32:21] were still created for his pleasure
[1:32:27] we ought to be so excited about this
[1:32:28] word
[1:32:30] our first responsibility is to stir up
[1:32:32] the love of god in our heart
[1:32:34] get so in love with god a constant
[1:32:38] burning of the fire and love of god in
[1:32:41] the heart that's the first thing
[1:32:42] yes amen the second
[1:32:46] is the responsibility to let him place
[1:32:48] his seed inside of you
[1:32:50] the seed of the word is not just for you
[1:32:53] to become more
[1:32:55] like him
[1:32:58] but a burden to see god multiplied in
[1:33:01] another's person's life beside you
[1:33:03] that's the part of god that we don't pay
[1:33:04] attention to very much you're here
[1:33:06] because of that part
[1:33:08] you are here because of that part of god
[1:33:11] in other words
[1:33:12] god didn't just die for you right he
[1:33:15] died for your brothers and sisters
[1:33:17] amen amen and he loves them as much as
[1:33:20] he loves you
[1:33:22] and we need to love them as much as we
[1:33:24] love god
[1:33:33] eternal life is living for other
[1:33:36] people's souls
[1:33:42] for their soul that's that constant
[1:33:45] burning put you out yonder winning
[1:33:49] converting souls to jesus christ
[1:33:52] multiplying
[1:33:53] children of god those of light precious
[1:33:55] faith
[1:33:56] that's what eternal life is
[1:34:04] there was someone that are working
[1:34:09] um he makes cheesecakes so i wanted to
[1:34:15] do something for my wife and make her
[1:34:17] cheesecake for mother's day
[1:34:18] not me but buy it you know it's easier
[1:34:20] to buy than
[1:34:25] it was the sacrifices most ever paid for
[1:34:27] for
[1:34:28] a cheesecake
[1:34:32] so i wasn't a great sacrifice on my part
[1:34:40] but that's not living for others
[1:34:45] there's no soul involved there it's a
[1:34:47] nice good deed
[1:34:50] it's encouraging it helps it's but it's
[1:34:53] not
[1:34:53] living for others living for others is
[1:34:56] when you stop
[1:34:57] your life and you're talking about
[1:35:00] another
[1:35:00] person's soul amen
[1:35:04] when you're doing something that's going
[1:35:06] to bring that soul
[1:35:07] to a place of conversion
[1:35:10] otherwise you could do live your whole
[1:35:13] life
[1:35:14] for somebody their soul never be
[1:35:17] converted
[1:35:18] and it will absolutely be in vain at the
[1:35:20] end of the day
[1:35:21] right amen so living for others is not
[1:35:26] naturally
[1:35:30] let our conversation be more about
[1:35:33] getting somebody saved
[1:35:37] brothers brother said that his deep
[1:35:40] love his love
[1:35:43] down deep inside of us should be a
[1:35:45] constant burning
[1:35:47] of the fire and love of god in their
[1:35:48] heart that doesn't stop
[1:35:50] with us doesn't stop with us
[1:35:56] it should put us out yonder with people
[1:35:59] making converts to christ
[1:36:01] to be fruitful multiply and to replenish
[1:36:04] the earth with god's children
[1:36:08] i'll tell you i just cringe
[1:36:13] when people say and my children you know
[1:36:15] i just want to be like you
[1:36:17] you do not want that dream
[1:36:20] you do not want that no matter what
[1:36:24] what you think you see
[1:36:28] i want to hear you say i want to be like
[1:36:29] jesus
[1:36:34] no stains in that
[1:36:38] the ministry that god has given to us
[1:36:40] will yield more
[1:36:41] children of god right we just must
[1:36:45] accept the responsibility of it
[1:36:49] second corinthians chapter 11 verse 2
[1:36:51] where we have to
[1:36:52] multiply quickly
[1:36:55] for i'm jealous over you with a godly
[1:36:58] jealousy for i have espoused you to one
[1:37:00] husband
[1:37:01] that i may present you as a chaste
[1:37:03] virgin to christ
[1:37:04] why does god want us as a chaste virgin
[1:37:08] he doesn't want
[1:37:10] any other seed inside of us
[1:37:14] he wants to place his seed inside of us
[1:37:17] for i fear lest by any means as the
[1:37:19] serpent begowed eve to a subtly
[1:37:22] so your mind should be corrupted from
[1:37:24] the simplicity that's in christ
[1:37:26] yes eve
[1:37:30] was hooked by the devil's thoughts
[1:37:34] in thinking that she could she could
[1:37:36] have control of her life
[1:37:37] and she would still be okay with god
[1:37:41] and it's the same thing the devil tells
[1:37:43] us every
[1:37:45] day right that's true we're at church
[1:37:49] i don't have to do that that's just
[1:37:51] brother john
[1:37:56] he certainly doesn't understand where
[1:37:59] i'm
[1:37:59] at what's going on
[1:38:02] i just want to say you don't understand
[1:38:04] who's talking thank you very
[1:38:06] much
[1:38:12] if we don't use the word we don't come
[1:38:14] up with the word we're saying our own
[1:38:15] words that's okay
[1:38:17] but how can we disagree with the word
[1:38:19] and say where
[1:38:20] did not the prophet say the holy ghost
[1:38:23] will never deny the word
[1:38:25] right amen so if you've got the holy
[1:38:28] ghost in you you can't wait to say amen
[1:38:31] to what you just heard
[1:38:32] amen amen now your flesh don't want to
[1:38:35] but that spirit inside you greater is he
[1:38:38] that's in you
[1:38:40] than the outside man amen amen
[1:38:44] god wants to place his seed inside of
[1:38:46] you he wants
[1:38:47] to see you bring forth another son
[1:38:50] and daughter of god
[1:38:55] you're special you've been called
[1:39:00] you've been predestinated by his foreign
[1:39:02] knowledge
[1:39:03] you are elect you are chosen
[1:39:08] for what to go replenish
[1:39:12] to multiply and to have dominion
[1:39:17] do not let any devil tell you
[1:39:20] that you can do what you want to do
[1:39:25] not dominion in the flesh dominion over
[1:39:27] all spirits
[1:39:29] right amen you'll cast out devils in my
[1:39:33] name
[1:39:35] dominion amen praise god
[1:39:38] amen first peter chapter 2 verse 9 we'll
[1:39:40] have to
[1:39:41] go quickly but ye are a chosen
[1:39:43] generation a royal priesthood a holy
[1:39:46] nation
[1:39:46] a peculiar people that you should show
[1:39:48] forth the praises of him who have called
[1:39:51] you
[1:39:51] out of darkness into his marvelous light
[1:39:54] amen which in times past were not a
[1:39:56] people but are
[1:39:58] now the people of god which have not
[1:40:00] obtained mercy
[1:40:01] but now have obtained mercy
[1:40:06] we're sitting in a different place than
[1:40:08] we were before we knew christ
[1:40:12] amen and today if you feel in your heart
[1:40:14] that you're not where you need to be in
[1:40:16] child
[1:40:16] in christ you still need to believe that
[1:40:18] you've been chosen you need to start
[1:40:20] walking in that direction amen don't
[1:40:23] wait till you do a lot of
[1:40:24] great things before you say oh yeah i
[1:40:26] think i'm there now no don't do that but
[1:40:28] don't have the attitude if i can't get
[1:40:29] there
[1:40:30] don't have the attitude of i guess i
[1:40:32] just am what i am
[1:40:34] no believe what god says about you that
[1:40:37] is the seed of god
[1:40:38] i'll tell you this if you're born in the
[1:40:40] image of god you will believe just like
[1:40:42] god believes
[1:40:45] it's by faith not by sight everything
[1:40:47] that god created was invisible when he
[1:40:49] created
[1:40:50] it it wasn't even in there there was no
[1:40:52] proof that it was going to happen
[1:40:53] but he believed it and it happened and
[1:40:55] his children are the same way
[1:40:57] amen whether you're for healing or
[1:41:01] whatever it is that you need
[1:41:02] you've got to believe it when you don't
[1:41:04] see it and that is a good evidence that
[1:41:06] you are
[1:41:07] in his image and believing it right
[1:41:10] luke chapter 1 verse 26 luke chapter 1
[1:41:14] verse 26
[1:41:15] and in the sixth month the angel gabriel
[1:41:18] was sent from god
[1:41:19] unto a city of galilee named nazareth
[1:41:22] to a virgin espoused to a man whose name
[1:41:25] was joseph by the house of david and
[1:41:28] the virgin's name was mary you all know
[1:41:29] the story and the angel came in unto her
[1:41:33] and said
[1:41:33] hell lord highly favored
[1:41:37] the lord is with thee blessed are thou
[1:41:40] among women amen and when she saw him
[1:41:44] she was troubled her heart sin
[1:41:46] and cast in her mind what manner of
[1:41:49] salutation this should be
[1:41:52] and the angel said and here fear not
[1:41:54] mary
[1:41:55] for you have found
[1:41:58] favor with god yes
[1:42:02] today you are here for the reason
[1:42:06] of you found favor with god amen
[1:42:12] and behold thou shalt conceive
[1:42:15] in thy womb and bring forth a son
[1:42:18] and shall call his name jesus
[1:42:22] what are you here for to receive god's
[1:42:26] word his son into your hearts
[1:42:30] luke chapter 1 verse 39 and mary arose
[1:42:34] in those days and went to the hill a
[1:42:37] country with haste
[1:42:39] into a city of judah and entered into
[1:42:41] the house of zechariah
[1:42:43] and saluted elizabeth
[1:42:47] and it came to pass that when elizabeth
[1:42:49] heard
[1:42:50] the salutation of mary the babe leaped
[1:42:54] in her womb and elizabeth
[1:42:58] was filled with the holy ghost
[1:43:03] and she spake out with the love voice
[1:43:06] can you imagine being filled with the
[1:43:07] holy ghost what's going to happen to you
[1:43:09] you're just going to start speaking the
[1:43:11] word of god
[1:43:13] so this is something prophetic is coming
[1:43:16] out of here
[1:43:17] blessed same message that the angel told
[1:43:20] her blessed earth now among women
[1:43:22] and blessed is the fruit of thy womb
[1:43:25] and when says this to me that the mother
[1:43:28] of the lord should come unto me
[1:43:30] for lo as soon as the voice of thy
[1:43:32] saltation sounded in my ears the baby
[1:43:34] leaped
[1:43:35] in my womb for joy and blessed is she
[1:43:39] that believed
[1:43:40] speaking of mary now speaking of you now
[1:43:43] for there shall be a performance of
[1:43:45] those things
[1:43:46] which were told her from the lord now
[1:43:49] it's important for you to believe that
[1:43:51] what you're hearing
[1:43:52] is from the lord and not from a man
[1:43:57] you don't want my performance
[1:44:00] i'm graded pretty bad i'm weighed in the
[1:44:04] balance and found mining
[1:44:06] amen but you need to believe in the word
[1:44:09] of the lord
[1:44:20] simple to believe what god says about
[1:44:23] you
[1:44:28] and through that belief you can become
[1:44:31] what he said
[1:44:35] it may bypass your feelings
[1:44:38] because when mary received the word
[1:44:41] there was no feelings no emotion no
[1:44:43] oh this is great this is exciting
[1:44:47] it wasn't any of that in fact her
[1:44:50] testimony is
[1:44:51] how can this be i have not known a man
[1:44:55] so she received the woo the word
[1:44:59] inside of her without sensation
[1:45:03] without emotion without feeling right
[1:45:06] she was sitting in church
[1:45:08] saying be it unto me amen so be it unto
[1:45:11] me according to that word
[1:45:13] amen we can receive the word the same
[1:45:16] way
[1:45:17] amen we can leave here knowing
[1:45:20] something happened because i believed it
[1:45:23] i never
[1:45:24] doubted it i took it with me and in time
[1:45:27] your belly your life will begin to show
[1:45:30] there'll be rivers of of
[1:45:31] living water springing forth out of you
[1:45:34] it'll show that something happened nine
[1:45:37] months
[1:45:38] from now you'll be able to look back and
[1:45:39] say yeah i told you nine months ago i
[1:45:41] said amen i believed at church amen
[1:45:45] don't try to walk out of here you know
[1:45:47] the only way that you know you received
[1:45:49] is something you flew off the
[1:45:50] fell down dances this no no just believe
[1:45:53] the word
[1:45:57] sure everybody likes that i like that
[1:45:59] let it happen
[1:46:00] we all can fall over get back up fall
[1:46:02] over here get back up dance in the
[1:46:04] spirit twirl around but you know none of
[1:46:06] that means anything
[1:46:07] what means everything is receive the
[1:46:08] word of god because that will change you
[1:46:11] that will get you out there making
[1:46:14] converts to christ
[1:46:17] it's inside of god for us to be fruitful
[1:46:20] to multiply you are the bride of christ
[1:46:24] you are the wife of christ what is a
[1:46:27] bride what does a wife do
[1:46:28] brings four children to who your your
[1:46:31] father your husband
[1:46:33] our heavenly father god almighty amen
[1:46:38] amen he's the firstborn of many brethren
[1:46:44] what greater privilege you women
[1:46:48] okay put yourself in the spot that mary
[1:46:51] was
[1:46:52] what an honor would be to have
[1:46:57] to give birth and she didn't really
[1:46:59] fully realize what was happening
[1:47:02] even after it happened
[1:47:05] she still that testimony your father and
[1:47:08] and
[1:47:08] and and your mother has been looking for
[1:47:10] you
[1:47:12] denouncing where jesus even came from
[1:47:18] but through a period of time i sure she
[1:47:20] could look back
[1:47:23] and knew that was truly a son that had
[1:47:26] been born
[1:47:28] without sin
[1:47:31] the son of god wouldn't it be glorious
[1:47:34] to be that woman
[1:47:36] now we know the catholic church they
[1:47:38] they've they made some
[1:47:39] thing out of it that they shouldn't have
[1:47:41] right
[1:47:43] right but wouldn't you like to bear the
[1:47:46] word of god today
[1:47:48] in a different form
[1:47:52] to take the word that you have been
[1:47:54] given
[1:47:55] so preciously by god through the power
[1:47:58] of a revelation
[1:47:59] into your heart and to take that
[1:48:01] precious word that's been revealed to
[1:48:03] you
[1:48:04] and bring it to someone who's just crazy
[1:48:06] out of there
[1:48:07] doesn't know nothing about god doesn't
[1:48:09] care about god
[1:48:11] and you bring them the light of the word
[1:48:14] and their
[1:48:14] nature gets changed all because of you
[1:48:19] there ain't no greater calling friends
[1:48:22] no greater honor
[1:48:26] we've been created for that purpose
[1:48:27] let's stand together
[1:48:33] share the gospel of jesus christ
[1:48:38] god wants us to be spiritual mothers
[1:48:41] to make converts to christ
[1:48:45] not complex it's not hard
[1:48:51] it can be a little time consuming
[1:49:04] i think who owns a car free and clear
[1:49:08] who owns a car free and clear okay
[1:49:11] big brother larry first brother has a
[1:49:13] car he owns it free and clear
[1:49:17] not leasing it doesn't bother anybody if
[1:49:20] i say brother larry i'll give you
[1:49:22] twenty thousand nine hundred dollars for
[1:49:25] that car
[1:49:26] would you sell it
[1:49:30] so the answer to that is yes
[1:49:35] i'll be praying for my pastor when i'm
[1:49:36] done with this deal but not before
[1:49:42] after i bought that car that car belongs
[1:49:44] to me
[1:49:46] the lawyer can't come back and say
[1:49:49] now i want to do something with that car
[1:49:52] no he's going to take his twenty
[1:49:54] thousand dollars and
[1:49:56] buy another one and still have 15 left
[1:49:58] over
[1:50:02] god bought and purchased our souls
[1:50:05] amen our lives our bodies
[1:50:10] it was well worth the deal oh yeah yeah
[1:50:13] sure lord
[1:50:14] any i want to be saved we can't go back
[1:50:17] on the deal
[1:50:19] amen
[1:50:22] we were born to bring him pleasure
[1:50:27] so let him take your life and use it the
[1:50:30] way he wants to
[1:50:31] yes amen amen
[1:50:34] it'll bring glory and honor you never
[1:50:37] ever
[1:50:38] regret winning someone to the lord
[1:50:40] you'll never go a hundred thousand years
[1:50:42] and say you know what
[1:50:44] it probably really wasn't worth it on
[1:50:45] the other side
[1:50:48] but everything else will be in vain
[1:50:51] everything else will come tune and only
[1:50:53] what's done for christ will last
[1:50:55] amen that's our heart amen with every
[1:50:58] head bound every eye closed

[1:51:16] with all of our hearts believing your
[1:51:18] word believing why we were created
[1:51:24] lord we have a greater understanding why
[1:51:27] our flesh needs to be crucified because
[1:51:29] it isn't our desire to serve you the way
[1:51:31] you want us to
[1:51:36] lord we pray that you give us the grace
[1:51:38] to deny our flesh
[1:51:41] that we may be able to fulfill your will
[1:51:44] i pray that you take our lives
[1:51:47] i pray that you begin to multiply sons
[1:51:49] and daughters through us
[1:51:51] through our time to our mind to our
[1:51:53] burden
[1:51:57] it's hard it's rugged
