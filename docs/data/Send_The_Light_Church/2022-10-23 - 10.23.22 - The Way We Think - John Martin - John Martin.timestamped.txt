[33:21] Lord we love you we thank you for this
[33:23] now we pray that you bless your word to
[33:27] our hearts by the power of Revelation
[33:29] and we'll give you the praise in Jesus
[33:31] name for it amen amen God bless you it's
[33:36] read God's word now in Joshua chapter 24
[33:39] starting with verse number 14. now
[33:41] therefore fear the lord and serve him in
[33:44] sincerity and in truth and put away the
[33:48] gods which your father served on the
[33:50] other side of the flood and in Egypt and
[33:52] serve ye the Lord
[33:55] and it if it seemed evil unto you to
[33:58] serve the Lord choose you this day whom
[34:01] you will serve
[34:02] whether the gods which your fathers
[34:04] serve that were on the other side of the
[34:06] flood of the Gods of the amorites in
[34:07] whose land you dwell but as for me in my
[34:10] house we will serve the Lord so when I
[34:12] think of my father's my father my mother
[34:15] my parents my relatives who they serve
[34:17] they basically serve their flesh right
[34:21] amen and um so
[34:24] the god that you put for your flesh is
[34:28] the god you're serving so even though
[34:30] we're not looking at amorites and things
[34:32] we still need to put away the things
[34:35] that are natural Mom and Dad's had
[34:38] served that wasn't of God Amen
[34:41] and the people answered and said God
[34:44] forbid that we should forsake the Lord
[34:46] to serve other gods for the Lord Our God
[34:49] he is
[34:50] uh he it is that brought us up in our
[34:54] fathers out of the land of Egypt from
[34:56] the house of bondage and which did those
[34:59] great signs in our sight and preserved
[35:02] us all in the way wherein he went we
[35:05] went and among all the people through
[35:07] whom we passed and the Lord drove out uh
[35:11] from before us all the people even the
[35:13] amorites which go out in the land
[35:15] therefore we will also serve the Lord
[35:18] for he is our God and Joshua is unto the
[35:22] people you cannot serve the Lord
[35:27] he's first telling them to choose and
[35:30] and to and to choose to serve the Lord
[35:32] and imagine to choose a certainly made
[35:34] it made the Declaration that he was
[35:36] going to serve the Lord now he's making
[35:38] this statement here
[35:39] you cannot serve the Lord
[35:42] for he is a holy God he is a jealous God
[35:46] he will not forgive your transgressions
[35:50] nor your sins
[35:52] if you forsake the Lord and serve
[35:55] strange Gods then he will turn and do
[35:59] you hurt and consume you
[36:02] after that you have done you good our
[36:07] brothers has been talking about jealousy
[36:10] in our men's meetings and here we see a
[36:13] great sign of God's jealousy
[36:16] and the people said unto Joshua nay but
[36:18] we will serve the Lord and Joshua said
[36:21] unto the people your witness is against
[36:23] yourselves that you have chosen that ye
[36:26] have chosen you the Lord to serve him
[36:28] and they said we Are Witnesses now
[36:31] therefore put away said he the strange
[36:34] gods that are among you and inclined
[36:36] your heart unto the Lord of his Lord God
[36:38] of Israel and the people said unto
[36:40] Joshua the Lord Our God will we serve in
[36:43] his voice will we obey amen God bless
[36:47] you may be seated
[36:49] well
[36:51] brother Tim Sean was here we had some
[36:56] some wonderful messages here of late
[36:59] and brother Tim had spoke on speak and
[37:02] go forward in faith just a word of
[37:05] encouragement for us
[37:07] after that we had a a little message on
[37:10] fighting for Faith the Lord had been
[37:12] dealing with us prior to that service
[37:16] and so we felt it fit in and then
[37:19] brother Daryl ministered on hold on so
[37:22] we got going forward and holding on
[37:24] those were encouraging messages for our
[37:27] church Amen brother Mark preached on the
[37:31] the power of decision last Wednesday and
[37:35] uh he talked about maybe doing a little
[37:38] series on that and digging deeper into
[37:41] that and how important it is and so
[37:45] before uh before he was speaking on that
[37:48] uh Monday and Tuesday we were studying
[37:53] the word while we were on our little
[37:55] anniversary and we of course we didn't
[37:58] interfere with Cheryl we did it when she
[37:59] was sleeping
[38:01] and uh but we were studying on this
[38:04] message today and
[38:06] um
[38:07] we want to entitle this message the way
[38:09] we think
[38:10] the way we think we don't put a lot of
[38:13] stock in the way that we think
[38:17] but for a subject we want to talk about
[38:19] serving the lord with our thoughts
[38:22] we're choosing to to serve the Lord uh
[38:27] we we view it one way but we just kind
[38:31] of want to do a little
[38:33] Bible study we're going to be going
[38:34] through a lot but the main thing is for
[38:37] us to see that we just don't serve God
[38:40] outwardly out here but it's constantly
[38:44] in our mind and in our thoughts and
[38:47] we're in the greatest battle ever fought
[38:49] brother Bynum said is so it's difficult
[38:51] to serve the Lord with our thoughts
[38:54] brother Brian set our mind is the womb
[38:56] to our soul it's the place that the
[38:58] devil operates from because he wants to
[39:01] control our nature so if he can control
[39:04] our thoughts he can control our nature
[39:06] and oftentimes we allow the devil if I
[39:09] could say too much Liberty in our mind
[39:11] not that he should ever be there but
[39:13] it's like a child on a playground or a
[39:16] teenager at a concert or a fan at a
[39:18] football game and they they just kind of
[39:21] go crazy and wild and anything goes it's
[39:24] like having a party there's hardly any
[39:27] limitations
[39:30] but if we were in a library or a museum
[39:32] or a church there would be limitations
[39:36] right well our minds need to have
[39:39] limitations as well
[39:42] uh like the love of God it thinketh no
[39:45] evil so it has boundaries it has
[39:48] limitations
[39:50] it's limited to the things that are pure
[39:52] lovely true honest of a good report that
[39:55] brings virtue to us that brings praise
[39:59] to God and so we need to stay in those
[40:02] boundaries and we we notice that if we
[40:04] get out of those boundaries then all
[40:07] sudden we lose our peace true amen
[40:09] that's right and it's all happens in our
[40:13] minds
[40:14] we allow the devil too much space in our
[40:17] minds and when we do he has a way of
[40:19] tricking us
[40:22] we should be practicing more how to
[40:25] resist the devil here
[40:27] instead of fighting out here with people
[40:30] that disagree with us
[40:32] we need to fight the enemy right here
[40:35] because when we fight him here God can
[40:38] show us how to help somebody out here
[40:40] right
[40:42] now just to be honest with you Satan
[40:44] comes and speaks to us he doesn't have
[40:46] any valuable information for us
[40:48] he's trying to trick us
[40:51] now because our thoughts are private we
[40:54] sometimes have this uh this thinking
[40:57] that we can pretty much think whatever
[40:58] we want because nobody knows about it
[41:00] we're safe as long as we don't speak the
[41:02] words out loud to somebody and and and
[41:05] like a uh
[41:08] we can do two things at one time we can
[41:10] think one thoughts here and speak other
[41:12] words here
[41:13] that's true and um
[41:16] our thoughts
[41:18] may be private to one another
[41:20] but they're not private to God in fact
[41:24] they speak louder in heaven than our
[41:27] words do down here
[41:29] Hebrews 4 12 says for the word of God is
[41:33] quick and powerful and sharper than any
[41:35] two-edged sword it's piercing even to
[41:38] the dividing asunder the soul in the
[41:40] spirit and the joints tomorrow and is a
[41:42] discerner of the thoughts and intents of
[41:46] the heart
[41:48] if you really want to help your
[41:50] spiritual walk you have to subject
[41:53] yourself to the word
[41:57] now that word is not just when we're
[41:59] here hearing the word being preached
[42:01] yes the word is here but the word is
[42:05] with you amen
[42:07] amen when you're not in church and that
[42:10] word is still a discerner
[42:12] and how many times have you thought
[42:14] something did something wrong and all of
[42:16] a sudden you felt a conviction
[42:19] well that's that's the Lord there
[42:21] letting you know what just transpired
[42:23] wasn't appropriate was it right
[42:27] yeah and and so the more that we can
[42:30] yield to that in our thought pattern
[42:34] the more we'll catch it ahead of time
[42:35] right
[42:38] neither verse 13 neither is there any
[42:42] creature that is not manifest in his
[42:44] sight
[42:45] for all things are naked and open unto
[42:50] the eyes of him with whom
[42:53] we have to do amen I don't I don't want
[42:57] to be carnal but just imagine uh
[43:01] God just looking at all of our thoughts
[43:05] and all the time we can't hide anything
[43:06] we can hide them from one another but we
[43:09] can't hide them from God
[43:11] and what good is it to hide it from one
[43:13] another
[43:16] because it's not going to help us
[43:20] it's not going to help us
[43:24] see the devil is always trying to hide
[43:28] and it's only when he's uncovered does
[43:32] he leave and you've got to call it out
[43:34] call him out and tell him to get out of
[43:37] here
[43:38] but if you don't recognize it's the
[43:41] devil you think it's your brother you
[43:42] think it's your sister you think it's
[43:43] your neighbor think it's so the guy at
[43:45] work or whatever then then you don't
[43:48] really call him out
[43:55] I believe we
[43:57] if we watched our thoughts more with
[43:59] fear and trembling yeah that's right I I
[44:02] believe we'd be more Victorious
[44:05] because we're so used to thinking
[44:07] whatever we want and we're okay because
[44:10] we're hid in this thing that nobody can
[44:12] see but the devil sees it he knows what
[44:16] you're thinking he's the one that put
[44:18] the thought there
[44:21] and the devil
[44:23] devil is he's trying
[44:26] to get control more control because he
[44:30] wants to he wants to destroy right
[44:33] that's right so the way that we think
[44:35] has everything to do with how we serve
[44:40] with how we serve God and and really who
[44:43] we're serving amen
[44:45] brother Ryan says we live in a
[44:47] three-room house it's body
[44:49] spirit and soul and he asked the
[44:51] question who are who are you and he said
[44:53] you are a soul
[44:56] so
[44:57] the scripture says but as for me in my
[45:00] house
[45:02] so for as for me my soul
[45:05] in my house the body I live in the
[45:08] spirit that's around me
[45:10] we will serve the Lord
[45:13] so you have to serve the Lord with your
[45:16] thoughts you have to serve them with all
[45:18] of yourself amen that's right
[45:21] choosing to serve the Lord is the most
[45:23] important decision that a human can ever
[45:25] make
[45:27] many people think because they've chose
[45:29] to get baptized that they're they're
[45:31] presently serving the lord because they
[45:33] this they did this one thing back then
[45:36] but it's only when we can control our
[45:38] thoughts daily can we be successful in
[45:42] truly serving the lord
[45:45] many times people don't know how to
[45:47] handle problems in life because they
[45:50] never learn how to control their
[45:52] thoughts
[45:54] and because the devil is not going to
[45:57] show you how to handle a problem he is
[45:59] the author of confusion he don't know he
[46:02] don't want you to latch into how to
[46:04] solve problems so he confuses the mind
[46:07] he and then he he sends fear and makes
[46:10] it like it's impossible I don't know
[46:12] what to do he traps you so you have to
[46:15] take control of your thoughts if you
[46:17] really want to be successful in serving
[46:19] the lord you have to control your
[46:21] thoughts
[46:23] must always remember that choosing to
[46:25] serve the Lord is a daily decision that
[46:29] we we have in our heart not just I got
[46:31] baptized but a daily decision we have to
[46:34] choose it daily and it's expressed that
[46:37] decision is expressed in how
[46:41] we choose our thoughts to serve the Lord
[46:46] our thoughts have to serve the Lord
[46:48] amen amen it's serving the lord it's a
[46:52] particular way of thinking yes it's a
[46:56] it's it's not just scattered whatever
[47:00] it's a decisive attitude of who is going
[47:03] to control your thoughts
[47:07] you ever have thoughts just going
[47:08] everywhere and you wish they'd stop
[47:10] you can stop it
[47:15] the reason you feel you can't is because
[47:17] you've been so used to not ever
[47:20] controlling them
[47:23] right but the more you get in the habit
[47:25] of taking control the more you'll see
[47:27] you can't control your thoughts you
[47:30] can't stop the bird from flying over but
[47:32] you can stop them from making a nest
[47:35] okay the way we think every day has
[47:37] everything to do with who we're Who We
[47:40] Are
[47:40] and who we're serving
[47:43] Proverbs 23 verse 7 says for as a man
[47:46] thinketh in his heart so is he
[47:50] not he who got baptized or he that goes
[47:53] to church this is who he is no but is is
[47:56] how he thinks in his heart that's who he
[47:58] is excuse me
[48:00] as he thinks in his heart
[48:02] so we must be careful of how we think
[48:05] every minute of Our Lives
[48:09] it's really Who We Are
[48:11] truth when we choose to serve the Lord
[48:12] we must learn to choose to serve him
[48:15] with our thoughts
[48:18] you think this thought you're serving
[48:20] the lord with this thought it's no
[48:22] longer your Switzerland to think
[48:24] whatever you want and bounce things over
[48:25] and to make decisions up there and and
[48:29] no
[48:30] that is not it
[48:32] you got to make sure that you're
[48:34] whatever you're thinking it's serving
[48:36] the lord
[48:39] it's not a Switzerland where you can
[48:41] just kind of do what you want to do for
[48:43] a while and you know think about it and
[48:45] you know a half hour goes by and okay
[48:47] I'm going to go this way
[48:49] no you missed serving the lord for a
[48:51] half hour
[48:53] you got to resist him steadfast in the
[48:56] faith
[48:57] you have to quickly discern what what
[49:00] Spirit it is that's speaking to you is
[49:02] it a good thought that you're thinking
[49:04] and the devil has a way of always
[49:06] starting out you know when he gives you
[49:09] a thought about somebody he always
[49:11] starts out by giving you some some uh
[49:15] true information
[49:18] well this is this is true information we
[49:22] can think about it look what he did she
[49:25] did
[49:26] and then it turns into a little
[49:29] judgment
[49:32] you can't wait till all that happens to
[49:35] figure oh Lord that's wrong
[49:37] you miss serving the lord
[49:40] right so you we got to get rid of that
[49:42] thinking where it's okay to think what
[49:43] you want for a while
[49:48] Romans 6 16 says no ye not
[49:52] that to whom you yield yourself servant
[49:55] obey his servant ye are to whom you obey
[49:59] whether of sin unto death or of
[50:02] obedience unto righteousness
[50:05] to whom you yield yourself
[50:08] to whom you yield your mind
[50:11] not just your body but your your
[50:13] thoughts it all starts with your
[50:15] thoughts amen
[50:16] and then it will continue with your
[50:18] thoughts it will end with your thoughts
[50:19] your thoughts are important
[50:22] the way we think every day has
[50:24] everything to do with who we are and who
[50:26] we are serving don't ever ever forget
[50:30] that there are many examples in the
[50:33] Bible where men and women have started
[50:36] out the correct way serving the lord
[50:39] but end up
[50:41] going off
[50:44] and we know
[50:46] David
[50:48] good example Solomon
[50:51] Naaman Moses the children of Israel Saul
[50:55] Peter Balaam Jonah Elijah
[51:00] and the devil can even manipulate us
[51:03] with fear here here was Elijah he was
[51:05] bold enough to stand before 400 450 men
[51:08] right
[51:10] and then a little fear not little fear
[51:12] spirit of fear Came Upon him and then
[51:14] he's running away from one woman
[51:18] and and here Timothy he makes this this
[51:22] desire I'm going to serve the Lord
[51:24] but when he looked at the persecution
[51:31] he began to withdraw himself from
[51:34] service
[51:38] so you can start out correctly and any
[51:42] given time if you allow your thoughts to
[51:44] go the wrong direction you could stop
[51:46] serving the lord in the way that he has
[51:48] made
[51:50] that's right
[51:52] God has not given us a spirit of fear
[51:55] but it can come
[51:58] so we that have chosen to serve the Lord
[52:00] could still be misled
[52:05] by thinking the wrong way
[52:07] that's it you're thinking the wrong way
[52:09] there's it's not
[52:11] he made me do it she made me to the
[52:13] Devil May no
[52:15] by us choosing a wrong way of thinking
[52:18] we could start out on the straight
[52:20] narrow path that leads to eternal life
[52:22] and something begins to something
[52:25] happened and it caused us to slip away
[52:28] into to get off onto the Broadway the
[52:31] way that most people think which is you
[52:33] can think what you want
[52:37] say something different in front of
[52:39] people and they'll never know
[52:43] that leads to death
[52:46] Proverbs 14 12 says there is a way which
[52:49] seemeth right unto a man but the end
[52:52] thereof are the ways of death
[52:55] now this way which seems to be right
[52:58] unto man I want you to understand it's
[53:01] always lurking around us
[53:05] every day is is looking for an
[53:07] opportunity to get in there
[53:10] it isn't just well it was out there in
[53:12] the world no it's with you in your home
[53:15] it's with you when you you watch that
[53:18] thing when you listen to that thing when
[53:19] you get on your phone when you're when
[53:21] you hear somebody say something about
[53:23] somebody right right it's always lurking
[53:28] that's right we've all experienced many
[53:29] times that we thought we were right
[53:31] about something
[53:33] and then afterwards we discovered that
[53:36] we were wrong
[53:38] amen it's true and we don't put much
[53:41] emphasis in that right right but when
[53:44] you notice somebody else that does it
[53:48] told you you were wrong told you told
[53:50] you told you and you think about it but
[53:53] for yourself when you do it it's not a
[53:55] big thing why because it happens all the
[53:58] time
[53:59] it happens all the time
[54:04] becomes the norm for us
[54:10] scripture
[54:12] in James chapter 4 helps us to learn how
[54:14] to remain humble in the way that we
[54:16] think because we can end up bragging
[54:21] amen
[54:23] James 4 13 go to now ye that say today
[54:27] tomorrow
[54:29] we're going to do this that or the other
[54:32] this is what we're going to do
[54:34] afterwards and we're going to go here
[54:35] and then
[54:37] remember this spirit is not this is not
[54:41] the Holy Ghost
[54:42] right the Holy Ghost doesn't do that
[54:45] it it it's simply the nature of man's
[54:48] the natural man it's Pride right
[54:53] whereas you don't even know what shall
[54:55] be on tomorrow
[54:57] you just don't know well God told me
[55:01] okay God told you how many times have we
[55:03] thought God told us right
[55:07] and found out it really wasn't
[55:11] we can be so tricked by the enemy
[55:14] because he you know
[55:16] the Bible says that
[55:20] he uh he places himself
[55:24] and the throne instead of God acting as
[55:26] if he's God
[55:28] and we think this is like the Antichrist
[55:30] when he comes at the end and he sits on
[55:33] the Roman
[55:35] chair
[55:36] is the Antichrist and here he is
[55:39] but the thing is he tries to take the
[55:44] throne room
[55:45] of every one of us
[55:48] and and as the prophet told us this is
[55:50] where he has chosen
[55:54] this is where he's at
[55:56] and and he he makes it look like it's
[56:00] really God
[56:02] and he wants us to go out there and say
[56:05] yeah God told me God told me this and it
[56:08] not happened why because it brings
[56:10] disgrace to God
[56:13] and that is what Satan wants
[56:18] and that's that's why the Holy Spirit
[56:20] doesn't do that even
[56:23] if the Lord shows you
[56:28] okay
[56:33] we still have to have a spirit I could
[56:35] be wrong
[56:36] we still have to have the spirit if it
[56:39] be the will of the Lord
[56:42] it just it's having that putting God
[56:46] first instead of allowing your chest to
[56:49] be you know pumped up like like you're
[56:51] something special
[56:53] are you with me
[56:55] for what is your life it's even a vapor
[56:57] that appears for a little time in the
[56:59] vanished away
[57:01] we think we know what shall be but often
[57:03] we don't
[57:07] so just follow the scriptures we don't
[57:10] we don't
[57:12] want a yield to that Spirit of boasting
[57:14] because we know something
[57:18] like I don't mean it wrong
[57:21] but who cares
[57:23] who cares that you know
[57:28] if you know if God showed you it's truly
[57:32] the grace of God
[57:34] let's give him the glory let's Magnify
[57:37] Him
[57:39] and let's follow the word
[57:42] amen
[57:44] all right
[57:46] for you all to say if the Lord will we
[57:49] shall live or do this or that
[57:53] see there's no breaking there
[57:55] there's there's no attention to be drawn
[57:59] to yourself something
[58:03] but now you rejoice
[58:05] in what in your bolsteins the very fact
[58:08] that you're you're talking like this
[58:11] the scripture is identifying you it's a
[58:13] boasting
[58:15] and he goes as far as saying that all
[58:18] such rejoicing
[58:20] is from the Devil
[58:22] it's evil it's wrong
[58:25] but we think we're so right
[58:29] we're having like a gale time rejoicing
[58:31] in what evil
[58:33] and don't even realize it therefore to
[58:37] him that knoweth to do good and doeth
[58:40] not to him that is sin so if you know
[58:44] if you know that you shouldn't be
[58:45] talking like that and you're doing it
[58:48] anyways
[58:49] that's sent to you
[58:51] that is sin to you in the midst of your
[58:54] bolstein of your rejoicing
[58:57] you're sitting
[58:59] Lord help us
[59:01] all right Romans 12 verse 3 for I say
[59:04] through the grace given unto me
[59:07] to every man that is among you
[59:10] not to think of himself more highly than
[59:12] he ought to
[59:13] I think
[59:15] but to think soberly according as God
[59:18] has dealt to every man the measure
[59:21] of faith
[59:27] so when we get all these we know faith
[59:29] is when God's peace to us personally and
[59:31] we think a lot of times God says
[59:33] something to us to find out that it
[59:34] wasn't okay
[59:37] so what we can say is that God really
[59:39] never dealt that Measure of Faith to us
[59:41] we just thought he did
[59:42] you understand
[59:46] so we need
[59:49] to not think higher than the actual
[59:52] Faith he's given us in other words a lot
[59:53] of times we speak by hope
[59:56] I hope this was God sounded good I want
[59:59] it to happen
[1:00:01] but it doesn't mean it's faith
[1:00:04] brother John how do I know I'm thinking
[1:00:07] too high of myself
[1:00:09] because it says you shouldn't think more
[1:00:12] highly than you ought to that means I
[1:00:13] can think somewhat right how do I how do
[1:00:17] I know how do I know when I'm thinking
[1:00:19] too high well anytime you're thinking
[1:00:24] about
[1:00:25] yourself
[1:00:28] anytime you're thinking you're more
[1:00:30] special than someone or someone else is
[1:00:34] a little bit less than you
[1:00:37] you're thinking too high
[1:00:43] we're we're all one in Christ
[1:00:46] we're all one in Christ and you know it
[1:00:48] wouldn't matter to me what
[1:00:51] office or position God put us all in in
[1:00:55] heaven or here on Earth it wouldn't make
[1:00:57] a difference why because we're still one
[1:01:00] in Christ
[1:01:02] the position has nothing to do with it
[1:01:04] we didn't have anything to do with it
[1:01:05] we're not called
[1:01:07] by we don't call ourselves to a position
[1:01:10] right
[1:01:11] to a body we don't God calls us and
[1:01:15] we're to be content in the calling that
[1:01:17] he's called us in but we need to be won
[1:01:20] that's what our Focus needs to be
[1:01:24] remember the way that we think
[1:01:25] eventually will lead you to your destiny
[1:01:29] let's take a look at Lucifer
[1:01:31] he was perfect until his thought became
[1:01:34] mixed just became mixed with iniquity
[1:01:40] in other words he didn't denounce
[1:01:42] everything about himself
[1:01:45] and that's a lot of times you know we
[1:01:47] look at how great we are
[1:01:49] right yeah God Made You great
[1:01:52] and sure certainly that the devil
[1:01:54] doesn't want you to take your your eyes
[1:01:55] off of that
[1:01:57] he just wants you to mix that with a
[1:01:59] little bit of iniquity and basically
[1:02:02] iniquity is not doing the things that
[1:02:04] you're created to do that you know that
[1:02:07] you should be doing the right things you
[1:02:08] should be doing you simply won't do them
[1:02:10] I don't feel like worshiping don't feel
[1:02:12] like going church don't feel like
[1:02:13] praying don't feel like reaching out
[1:02:14] that's all iniquity
[1:02:17] that's all iniquity
[1:02:19] Isaiah 14 verse 13 Isaiah 14 verse 13.
[1:02:22] you want to write it for thou has said
[1:02:24] in
[1:02:26] what
[1:02:28] talking about Lucifer's thoughts right
[1:02:30] now
[1:02:31] we're talking about the way that Lucifer
[1:02:33] thinks for thou has said in thine heart
[1:02:37] I will Ascend into heaven I will exalt
[1:02:39] my throne above those stars of God I
[1:02:41] will sit also upon the Mount of the
[1:02:43] congregation in the sides of the north I
[1:02:45] will Ascend above the heights of the
[1:02:47] clouds I will be like the most high you
[1:02:49] know you can say a lot of things in your
[1:02:50] thoughts
[1:02:53] you can have a big conversation in your
[1:02:56] thoughts
[1:02:59] and when you exalt yourself in your
[1:03:02] thoughts
[1:03:03] you will find you will exalt yourself in
[1:03:05] your words
[1:03:07] and in your actions
[1:03:11] so we need to watch our thoughts they
[1:03:12] become our words we need to watch our
[1:03:14] words and become our actions we need to
[1:03:15] watch our actions because they become
[1:03:17] our our behavior and our Behavior
[1:03:19] becomes our destiny
[1:03:21] it it just it the thought process of
[1:03:24] what we're talking about is so crucial
[1:03:26] you can't bypass that and try to correct
[1:03:28] everything else
[1:03:30] it just won't work
[1:03:33] it's like putting peacock feathers on
[1:03:37] you've got to pay attention to the way
[1:03:40] that you think
[1:03:43] it's quite easy to think wrong
[1:03:46] the devil is the master of Deceit
[1:03:48] he's capable making Believers think
[1:03:50] they're right when they're wrong
[1:03:53] John 16 verse 2 Jesus said thou they
[1:03:56] shall put you out of the synagogue yea
[1:03:59] the time cometh
[1:04:01] that whosoever killeth you
[1:04:04] will think that he's doing God service
[1:04:09] [Laughter]
[1:04:10] here are people thinking they're doing
[1:04:13] God a service and they're literally
[1:04:17] their thinking's all messed up
[1:04:21] think about the times you've opened your
[1:04:22] mouth and killed somebody's influence
[1:04:24] and you actually thought you were doing
[1:04:26] God a service well I got to tell this
[1:04:29] person the real truth about it
[1:04:32] true
[1:04:33] thinking they're doing out of service
[1:04:34] the Devil he's a good trainer
[1:04:39] he teaches us how to send messages to
[1:04:42] people
[1:04:43] without using words
[1:04:50] well I don't but
[1:04:53] but the body has ability to send the
[1:04:56] same message
[1:04:57] by not saying an exact word
[1:05:03] the Devil he's a good trainer
[1:05:07] the Bible says in the Book of James our
[1:05:09] tongue is an unruly evil it's full of
[1:05:11] deadly poison there with we bless God
[1:05:14] the father and there with curse We Men
[1:05:17] which are made just like God at the same
[1:05:21] similitude of God Amen out of the mouth
[1:05:23] precedes blessings cursings
[1:05:27] a Brethren these things
[1:05:29] ought not to be so so here we are
[1:05:31] our thoughts need to be consistent
[1:05:36] they can't be bouncing all over the
[1:05:38] place you you got to learn from that
[1:05:40] trick that the devil
[1:05:43] tries to send to you about something
[1:05:44] negative about somebody
[1:05:46] it's a trick get used to it
[1:05:50] God has allowed it
[1:05:52] God has allowed the devil to put any
[1:05:54] thought he wants to in her mind
[1:05:57] it's up to us to take control
[1:06:01] we need to learn to hold our accounts
[1:06:04] accountable our thoughts accountable
[1:06:07] to try the spirit that's speaking to us
[1:06:10] to see if it's of God or or not
[1:06:13] it's impossible to stable
[1:06:16] our thinking
[1:06:19] when we just don't care about what we
[1:06:21] think
[1:06:23] so if you want to be a stable believer
[1:06:26] you have to stabilize your thinking
[1:06:30] don't don't think you just get away and
[1:06:32] continue to think the way you've always
[1:06:34] thought and become a stable believer
[1:06:36] amen amen if you always did what you've
[1:06:38] always done you're always going to get
[1:06:39] what you always got
[1:06:41] so you've got to take control of your
[1:06:43] thoughts
[1:06:46] it's not that hard right
[1:06:49] you just gotta want to amen if you
[1:06:52] you're lazy and you don't care you're
[1:06:54] not going to get anywhere right
[1:06:58] can you imagine how unstable the roads
[1:07:03] would be
[1:07:06] if the police only pulled over
[1:07:10] their favorite
[1:07:12] brand of vehicles
[1:07:16] so if everybody knew that the police
[1:07:18] they love Chevy's well everybody would
[1:07:21] drive Fords and everything else just so
[1:07:24] they wouldn't get pulled over
[1:07:27] it'd be a little unstable wouldn't it
[1:07:29] or firefighters would only be willing to
[1:07:33] put out a fire if it was in their
[1:07:35] favorite neighborhood
[1:07:38] or companies
[1:07:40] would be if their workers only came to
[1:07:43] work when they felt like it
[1:07:47] of course covet help us to understand a
[1:07:49] little bit
[1:07:50] of what it feels like I mean every fast
[1:07:53] food place you go to they got a help
[1:07:55] wanted sign
[1:07:57] and it it just it's confusing it's chaos
[1:08:01] it's unstable
[1:08:03] and that's that's what's happening in a
[1:08:06] world Imagine the grocery stores only
[1:08:08] putting out fresh produce and meat once
[1:08:11] a month
[1:08:14] and you you had to go there weekly to
[1:08:16] get your food what what that that's not
[1:08:18] stable enough for you
[1:08:22] so how do you expect to stabilize your
[1:08:24] life when your thoughts are
[1:08:26] it's okay this time to think evil it's
[1:08:29] okay that just doesn't matter what you
[1:08:30] think about
[1:08:32] it does matter that's what this message
[1:08:35] is about it does matter
[1:08:37] amen it's impossible to be a stable
[1:08:39] believer if our thinking is unstable
[1:08:44] the scripture teaches that a
[1:08:46] double-minded man is unstable in all his
[1:08:49] ways
[1:08:50] we can't respect some people and not
[1:08:53] others
[1:08:54] that's unstable amen
[1:08:56] amen we can't think it's only important
[1:08:59] to go to church when it's convenient for
[1:09:01] us that's unstable
[1:09:03] we can't be subject to part of the word
[1:09:05] and not then to another part of the word
[1:09:07] that's unstable amen we can't be
[1:09:10] accountable some of the times and other
[1:09:12] times we're not going to be that's
[1:09:14] unstable
[1:09:17] if we think
[1:09:19] if the way we think is inconsistent
[1:09:23] then our values become inconsistent
[1:09:28] sometimes we're standing this way
[1:09:32] believing for something and then
[1:09:34] sometimes it's not that big a deal
[1:09:36] you understand
[1:09:39] parents children need to see
[1:09:42] stability in your life
[1:09:44] consistency in your life it's important
[1:09:48] they don't know what to do if you're
[1:09:51] here and there and everywhere
[1:09:53] because there's going to come a time
[1:09:54] they need you
[1:09:57] our first nature is basically governed
[1:10:01] so much by feelings and emotions
[1:10:05] and our you know anybody that's has
[1:10:08] feelings emotions which we all do this
[1:10:09] is not a foreign thing to anybody here
[1:10:11] they're up and down
[1:10:13] sometimes you feel like a nut sometimes
[1:10:15] you don't
[1:10:16] sometimes you feel like um
[1:10:19] you know I'm just I'm nothing
[1:10:23] I just don't feel worth anything and I'm
[1:10:25] just not good for nothing and the next
[1:10:28] minute you think you're the best thing
[1:10:31] same person just hours later
[1:10:36] That's What feelings and emotions do
[1:10:38] they're not stable you can't rely on
[1:10:40] them
[1:10:41] they're not going to stabilize you it's
[1:10:43] not well I'm going to control my
[1:10:45] feelings no it's not about controlling
[1:10:46] your feelings
[1:10:48] you've got to control your thoughts
[1:10:51] the word is what brings consistency to a
[1:10:55] believer's life
[1:10:56] we need to let the word be our absolute
[1:11:00] not the knowledge of it
[1:11:02] but the submission to it
[1:11:04] submission to the word with your
[1:11:06] thoughts
[1:11:07] knowledge will just puff you up but but
[1:11:10] you got to submitting to it now think
[1:11:13] about this look at this word he will
[1:11:15] keep the imperfect peace
[1:11:17] whose mind is stayed on the Lord look at
[1:11:19] the consistency right there
[1:11:22] the word is keep he will keep you
[1:11:25] now visit it once in a while
[1:11:28] he will keep you but you got to keep
[1:11:31] your thoughts stayed on him
[1:11:34] when Jesus taught us to forgive those
[1:11:36] who trespass against us or he would
[1:11:38] actually reverse
[1:11:40] our forgiveness
[1:11:42] he was teaching us that we're not more
[1:11:44] special than somebody else
[1:11:47] he's also teaching us to be like him
[1:11:50] that God is no respecter of persons
[1:11:54] that he wants us to consistently
[1:11:58] forgive others
[1:12:00] not pick and choose who we think is
[1:12:03] worthy of our forgiveness and who is not
[1:12:07] worthy of our forgiveness
[1:12:11] there's no consistency in that
[1:12:14] there's no stability in that
[1:12:17] God isn't like that he's he's no
[1:12:19] respecter of persons he's faithful and
[1:12:22] just if we just confess our sins he he
[1:12:24] will he will forgive us of our sins and
[1:12:26] we praise God for that what's wrong with
[1:12:29] us being like that right
[1:12:31] that should be our go to be like Jesus
[1:12:37] that's what it's all about
[1:12:39] to forgive like him to know him in that
[1:12:42] power to be able to forgive like him
[1:12:47] when Jesus taught us to love everyone
[1:12:49] including our men our enemies
[1:12:51] he was teaching us about the father's
[1:12:54] nature
[1:12:55] and and that we we can't pick and choose
[1:13:00] anymore
[1:13:01] we if we're going to be like and we got
[1:13:03] to be able to love our enemies we've got
[1:13:05] to be able to be consistency anybody who
[1:13:07] who comes to Christ loves somebody
[1:13:12] but usually hates somebody else
[1:13:16] and and the more you grow with the Lord
[1:13:19] the more you learn that I can't do that
[1:13:25] but we ultimately have to get to the
[1:13:27] place where we can be consistent with
[1:13:30] our love
[1:13:33] and the way you do that is up here you
[1:13:36] win that battle amen amen this is what
[1:13:39] the father wants of me this is what I
[1:13:42] choose up here I choose to serve the
[1:13:44] Lord
[1:13:45] it's not just I've made a decision I got
[1:13:48] baptized down here and I don't have to
[1:13:50] worry about any other choices no you
[1:13:51] make a lot of choices every day
[1:13:55] you you have to choose to serve the Lord
[1:13:57] in your thoughts
[1:13:59] if you don't you won't be able to to do
[1:14:01] it with your life God is consistent we
[1:14:05] need to be consistent Jesus Christ is
[1:14:07] the same yesterday today and forever we
[1:14:09] need to learn to be consistent in our
[1:14:11] thoughts every day
[1:14:12] and the word is the only thing that can
[1:14:14] establish and bring more of a
[1:14:16] consistency to our lives man shall not
[1:14:19] live by the natural substance but but
[1:14:21] what but by every word
[1:14:25] every word of God
[1:14:27] every word that brings consistency this
[1:14:31] word doesn't contradict itself
[1:14:33] if you stay with the word you will be
[1:14:36] you won't be contradicting yourself
[1:14:40] how many times we look we've all looked
[1:14:42] at one another and at some time or
[1:14:44] another
[1:14:45] and say that person is contradicting
[1:14:47] themselves this is what they said this
[1:14:49] is what they're doing
[1:14:52] right and it's
[1:14:55] Lord help us control our thoughts
[1:14:59] every single day we have to get up in
[1:15:01] the morning hold our thoughts
[1:15:03] accountable
[1:15:04] all the time
[1:15:06] I often think about my thoughts in the
[1:15:08] morning
[1:15:09] because I know if I don't get on my
[1:15:10] knees quick
[1:15:14] you you think about the things that you
[1:15:16] got to do that you want to do that you
[1:15:18] plan to do
[1:15:21] thank you
[1:15:22] things you have to do
[1:15:25] and you think well that's okay now I'm
[1:15:26] going to go and pray but when you get
[1:15:28] down to pray after you've done that it
[1:15:29] makes it hard to enter in
[1:15:32] you've just got that much more garbage
[1:15:34] to go through
[1:15:35] I'm telling you the quicker we can get
[1:15:37] along with God and get our thoughts in
[1:15:39] sync with him
[1:15:40] the better things will be
[1:15:44] we need to train the way that we think
[1:15:47] amen
[1:15:49] and then our lives will change
[1:15:52] be consistent
[1:15:55] try the spirit
[1:15:57] if the spirit that's speaking to you is
[1:16:00] 100 the word
[1:16:03] then you stay with that thought yes but
[1:16:06] if the spirit that's speaking to you is
[1:16:08] 99 word
[1:16:12] and one percent oops crosses the word
[1:16:17] called out it's of the devil
[1:16:21] that's that's the the tree of knowledge
[1:16:23] of Good and Evil it just can't stay all
[1:16:27] the way with the word
[1:16:30] when you discover
[1:16:32] the air
[1:16:34] you have to quickly resist the devil
[1:16:36] steadfast
[1:16:37] don't sit there and reason with it
[1:16:40] because the devil will prove by that one
[1:16:42] percent is okay
[1:16:45] God can still be in it oh I'm telling
[1:16:47] you if this word isn't for anybody it's
[1:16:50] for me
[1:16:53] we are not wrestling and fighting
[1:16:54] against one another
[1:16:56] against flesh and blood as the spirit
[1:16:59] speaks but against principalities
[1:17:00] against Powers against the rulers of
[1:17:03] Darkness of this world against spiritual
[1:17:05] wickedness and I places no that sounds
[1:17:07] pretty bleak doesn't it that's what
[1:17:10] we're fighting against
[1:17:12] but if we're truly fighting against this
[1:17:15] tell me how you act in your battle
[1:17:20] in other words if we talk about the
[1:17:22] Battle that's happened in Ukraine right
[1:17:24] now
[1:17:26] we can talk about the things that are
[1:17:28] getting blown up
[1:17:29] we talk about new lands that is getting
[1:17:33] either taken away or or gotten back and
[1:17:38] and we talk about the artillery we we
[1:17:40] talk about the damage things have
[1:17:42] happened talking about how we need more
[1:17:44] Weaponry you know what I'm talking about
[1:17:46] right
[1:17:46] well what about the Warfare that you're
[1:17:49] in let's
[1:17:50] do you talk about it
[1:17:53] do you call it out for what it is
[1:17:56] or is it always this person that person
[1:17:58] this situation that situation how come
[1:18:02] we don't call the battle out for what it
[1:18:03] is
[1:18:07] and see the devil don't want you to
[1:18:08] really know what's going on
[1:18:11] because when he when you know
[1:18:14] that he's the author of Confusion And
[1:18:16] you can call him out
[1:18:19] when you call up the devil then you can
[1:18:21] love your brother who's in the air
[1:18:24] but if you don't call up the devil
[1:18:26] um
[1:18:28] there's a resistance
[1:18:31] second Corinthians chapter 10 verse 3
[1:18:33] second Corinthians chapter 10 verse 3
[1:18:35] for though we walk in the flesh which we
[1:18:38] do
[1:18:39] we do not war like everybody else does
[1:18:42] in the world
[1:18:44] for the weapons of our Warfare are not
[1:18:46] carnal
[1:18:48] like everybody else in the world
[1:18:50] but they're Mighty amen I like that
[1:18:53] they're Mighty weapons but they're only
[1:18:56] through God
[1:18:58] to the pulling down of strong holds
[1:19:03] did you ever in your mind felt so
[1:19:08] pulled down
[1:19:12] by thoughts something happening in your
[1:19:15] mind you just felt so weighed down so
[1:19:19] changed so I don't know how to break
[1:19:21] through
[1:19:23] okay about a situation
[1:19:26] okay God's weapons are mighty
[1:19:31] we don't have to stay in that
[1:19:34] but you do have to call it out
[1:19:37] you have to if you don't call it out
[1:19:39] he's allowed to stay that that's just
[1:19:41] the the parameters that God set before
[1:19:43] the world began
[1:19:45] he prepares a table for us in the
[1:19:47] presence of our enemies the devil is
[1:19:49] allowed to be there until you tell him
[1:19:52] to get out
[1:19:54] he's not going to do it for you but if
[1:19:57] you do it he has to leave because that's
[1:19:59] what the name of Jesus is given to us
[1:20:01] for
[1:20:02] in fact you could be the weakest
[1:20:04] Christian
[1:20:05] and and Hell still going to tremble
[1:20:08] right
[1:20:09] all right casting down imaginations
[1:20:12] brother John I don't know how to do that
[1:20:13] they just keep flying around in my well
[1:20:15] start practicing that's what this is
[1:20:17] it's a way of thinking
[1:20:19] casting down imaginations and every High
[1:20:23] thing that exalteth itself against the
[1:20:27] knowledge of God
[1:20:28] and bringing into captivity every well
[1:20:32] most some of you are thinking they
[1:20:35] exaggerated no every thought to The
[1:20:39] Obedience of Christ
[1:20:44] all we want to do is start practicing
[1:20:47] that more I believe that we'll be more
[1:20:49] at peace
[1:20:51] will will feel set free
[1:20:55] we'll have more joy I look a man a man
[1:20:59] born of a woman is a few days in full
[1:21:02] trouble
[1:21:04] a man born of Jesus Christ
[1:21:08] is not eternity
[1:21:10] full of joy
[1:21:13] full of peace
[1:21:15] because he's been born of God we've got
[1:21:17] to get out of that arrangement
[1:21:20] of that first nature
[1:21:23] I don't care what we go through you can
[1:21:25] have peace
[1:21:27] you can have joy
[1:21:29] but you got to get out of the mindset
[1:21:31] that the devil has has has tried to
[1:21:34] plague us with see even though we've
[1:21:36] we've taken to stand for God we've got
[1:21:38] to take that stand every day in our
[1:21:39] thoughts
[1:21:41] every day we had a cast down
[1:21:42] imaginations and things that exalt
[1:21:45] itself against the word of God
[1:21:47] and and not just kind of you know resist
[1:21:51] it
[1:21:52] in the in in this in in the in the
[1:21:55] thought process of just uh devil get out
[1:21:58] of here
[1:21:59] no
[1:22:00] bring it into captivity
[1:22:03] put it under your feet you keep fighting
[1:22:06] until he's under your feet
[1:22:09] now he keeps buzzing back every five
[1:22:11] minutes
[1:22:13] sometimes you got to stay there in
[1:22:15] prayer right they that wait upon the
[1:22:17] Lord shall renew sometimes you just need
[1:22:19] a strong arm of Faith you take the sword
[1:22:21] and and with that devil
[1:22:24] sometimes we're afraid of the devil
[1:22:29] turn that around
[1:22:31] God's on your side amen stay with the
[1:22:34] word amen
[1:22:35] and having a Readiness I am ready
[1:22:40] to Revenge all Disobedience how do I do
[1:22:43] that how do I how do I make up
[1:22:47] when your obedience is fulfilled so
[1:22:50] you're in a battle that's the time that
[1:22:52] you need to be obedient yeah
[1:22:55] that's when you need to pull the thing
[1:22:57] out you need to call the devil out you
[1:22:59] need to take care of business right now
[1:23:01] because that's the obedience that needs
[1:23:03] to happen
[1:23:04] when you're in the battle there's
[1:23:06] obedience that's required not a oh man I
[1:23:09] wish somebody would just pray for me I'm
[1:23:11] really going through this thing
[1:23:13] look it's time to stand up
[1:23:17] right you know
[1:23:18] you didn't come to the Lord last week
[1:23:24] a lot of times we're just too afraid
[1:23:26] to take a stand because we're afraid to
[1:23:29] be obedient
[1:23:32] do you look on the things after the
[1:23:35] outward appearance
[1:23:36] we certainly don't we're talking about
[1:23:38] thoughts here today
[1:23:40] If any man trusts
[1:23:42] If any man trusts to himself that he is
[1:23:44] Christ let him
[1:23:47] of himself think this again that as he
[1:23:51] is Christ even so are so Eve so are we
[1:23:56] Christ
[1:23:57] so Paul is wanting us to understand is
[1:24:01] I'm not disagreeing with who you are
[1:24:04] but
[1:24:06] he was of Christ and the word that he
[1:24:08] was bringing to us was truth
[1:24:12] and we've got a
[1:24:14] we gotta we gotta practice this yes it
[1:24:16] can't be just a neat scripture that we
[1:24:18] we apply when things are really bad
[1:24:21] it's something that we need to think
[1:24:22] about on a regular basis amen
[1:24:27] choosing to serve the Lord and our
[1:24:29] thoughts it's very difficult
[1:24:31] it's it's easy to say it's it's hard to
[1:24:34] hold our thoughts accountable
[1:24:37] our flesh isn't disappearing anytime
[1:24:39] soon
[1:24:41] amen it's going to be with us
[1:24:42] to the end and it's constantly wanting
[1:24:45] to rise up as it were and pave its own
[1:24:47] way
[1:24:49] I'm gonna you know it doesn't matter
[1:24:50] what victory you had on Sunday Come
[1:24:52] Monday you're going to do your own thing
[1:24:54] that's what the flesh is telling us and
[1:24:56] we got to take a stand about
[1:25:00] Monday morning where our thoughts are
[1:25:01] going to go
[1:25:02] hey man
[1:25:04] even though we made a choice to serve
[1:25:06] the Lord it doesn't mean that our flesh
[1:25:07] is is just going to give up
[1:25:09] in fact when you get baptized that's
[1:25:12] when the battle starts ramping up
[1:25:15] when I was out in the world and this is
[1:25:17] this this is the
[1:25:19] um it's always been the lure of the
[1:25:22] world
[1:25:24] when you're in the world you don't have
[1:25:25] to listen to anybody
[1:25:28] that's why backsliders they love
[1:25:31] when they're in the world the people
[1:25:33] that left this message you know what I
[1:25:34] hear the most about people that leave
[1:25:36] this message
[1:25:37] they feel at Liberty
[1:25:41] Liberty
[1:25:43] well when I was in the world I felt at
[1:25:45] Liberty
[1:25:47] to do what I wanted to do
[1:25:49] but when I came to Christ you subject
[1:25:52] yourself to the word you you forfeit
[1:25:54] your rights
[1:25:56] now the Liberty that you have is in
[1:25:58] Christ
[1:26:01] and we got to remain
[1:26:04] in Christ
[1:26:11] don't be fooled by the devil
[1:26:14] into doing what you want to do
[1:26:19] become
[1:26:20] obedient everything that you know to do
[1:26:25] Psalms 23 says the Lord is my shepherd I
[1:26:28] shall not want
[1:26:31] we have to learn not to love our lives
[1:26:33] even unto death we're not getting away
[1:26:35] from it every day we have to learn to
[1:26:37] hate ourselves
[1:26:39] and you have to alert to hate yourself
[1:26:40] so much that when you're talking to
[1:26:42] other people they know you hate yourself
[1:26:46] you know we have a tendency of
[1:26:47] forgetting that when we're talking other
[1:26:48] people
[1:26:49] right because we kind of want to be
[1:26:51] exalted
[1:26:54] come on now
[1:26:57] Jesus gave us a remedy
[1:26:59] to help us each day he said If any man
[1:27:01] will come after me that means choose to
[1:27:03] serve me let him deny himself
[1:27:07] let him deny the way that he thinks
[1:27:10] what's important his own will his own
[1:27:12] desires and he needs to do it daily
[1:27:16] that's the key amen daily
[1:27:19] the hard decision to serve the Lord must
[1:27:22] be decided on a daily basis
[1:27:25] so much for this thinking well I don't
[1:27:27] have to worry about the next service
[1:27:30] I have to worry about until I get
[1:27:32] together I don't you got to get rid of
[1:27:34] that we are not serving God like a
[1:27:37] holiday calendar
[1:27:39] no it's it's it's it's the way we think
[1:27:41] when we're not here
[1:27:44] it's got to become more important to you
[1:27:49] amen obviously
[1:27:51] we're not going to serve God by default
[1:27:55] if we're going to do anything by default
[1:27:56] we're going to backslide that's default
[1:28:00] and and the prophet said we backslide
[1:28:02] what 100 times a day that was back then
[1:28:03] and maybe he was seeing for this hour I
[1:28:06] don't know but I'll tell you our
[1:28:08] thoughts
[1:28:10] backslide us
[1:28:12] and and we we can't put too much
[1:28:15] emphasis on this the nature that's
[1:28:18] inside of us is going to fight us tooth
[1:28:21] and nail
[1:28:22] to The Bitter End it doesn't it it
[1:28:25] doesn't want to give up to a full
[1:28:26] conversion
[1:28:28] just like the devil didn't want the
[1:28:31] children of Israel to all goal
[1:28:34] you know just let just a couple of you
[1:28:36] go
[1:28:37] all right then the animals or
[1:28:42] he's always trying to get a compromise
[1:28:47] but God knows that we need a full
[1:28:50] conversion the devil knows we need a
[1:28:52] full conversion we need to be working on
[1:28:54] the part that's not converted yet right
[1:28:57] amen we need to be working on the part
[1:28:59] that's not converted yet we need to be
[1:29:01] serious about that it's not going to be
[1:29:03] gifted to us right character is not a
[1:29:06] gift it's a victory
[1:29:08] so we must choose to lay down our
[1:29:10] thoughts right here
[1:29:12] every day every day are you thinking the
[1:29:15] right thing
[1:29:16] is it proper is that a good thought
[1:29:18] practice it practice it you may think
[1:29:22] it's silly but I'm telling you
[1:29:24] it'll give you freedom
[1:29:26] because all you're doing is trying to
[1:29:28] get yourself set free from the the
[1:29:30] chains that the enemy has put us under
[1:29:32] Isaiah 57 verse or 55 verse 7 Isaiah 55
[1:29:36] verse 7 if you want to write down let
[1:29:38] the wicked forsake his way
[1:29:40] and the unrighteous man his thoughts
[1:29:48] now
[1:29:49] let me see a a a raise of hands is there
[1:29:54] anybody here
[1:29:56] that asked God to forgive you of your
[1:30:00] sins each day
[1:30:04] so there means that we're there's times
[1:30:06] that we do unrighteous things is that is
[1:30:09] that can we say that not labeling us as
[1:30:12] unrighteous men because we're saints of
[1:30:14] God
[1:30:15] but understand we still deal obviously
[1:30:18] with wrong thoughts because that's what
[1:30:20] causes us to say Lord I'm sorry
[1:30:23] all right let the wicked forsake his way
[1:30:25] then righteous man his thoughts and let
[1:30:27] him return unto the Lord and that's what
[1:30:29] repentance does and he will have mercy
[1:30:31] upon you and to our God for he will
[1:30:34] abundantly pardon oh man that'll put us
[1:30:37] on everybody's face right there
[1:30:39] from my thoughts are not your thoughts
[1:30:41] wow how many times do we think can we
[1:30:44] just go through the course of the day
[1:30:46] God thinks what I think
[1:30:48] God likes what I like God accepts this
[1:30:52] never been able
[1:30:56] to cut the two in half
[1:30:59] for my thoughts are not your thoughts
[1:31:01] neither are my ways your way saith the
[1:31:03] Lord now imagine if we had the mind of
[1:31:06] Christ if we were operating by the mind
[1:31:07] of Christ those would be good thoughts
[1:31:10] but we don't always have because if you
[1:31:12] think about the minor Christ is humble
[1:31:14] it's a servant it's giving it's reaching
[1:31:16] out
[1:31:17] if we're doing that we can go with it
[1:31:20] but to go ahead and claim we got the
[1:31:22] mind of Christ and kind of doing our own
[1:31:23] thing it's one big ball of deception
[1:31:27] for as the heavens are higher than the
[1:31:29] earth soar my ways higher than your ways
[1:31:31] and my thoughts than your thoughts now
[1:31:34] he doesn't say there's a little bit of a
[1:31:36] distinguish here
[1:31:38] he says if you want to know the
[1:31:40] difference
[1:31:41] as far as the heaven is from the Earth
[1:31:45] that's how much different my thoughts
[1:31:47] are than your thoughts that's a huge
[1:31:49] difference we aren't about to tell the
[1:31:51] difference
[1:31:52] right we can tell the difference of
[1:31:54] black and white right
[1:31:56] but maybe two Shades of Gray
[1:31:58] you know it can get difficult but we
[1:32:00] must remember we have been gifted
[1:32:04] with knowing God's mind
[1:32:07] with God's thoughts it's right here
[1:32:10] and and you want to know more get into
[1:32:12] it more read more get on your knees pray
[1:32:14] more listen to a tape say God I want to
[1:32:16] know you I want to become you
[1:32:22] all right
[1:32:24] now the Lord is it I'm going to tell you
[1:32:27] why it's important
[1:32:29] for you to control your thoughts you
[1:32:31] have to agree with God's
[1:32:33] because God cannot work through you
[1:32:35] unless it goes through three more agency
[1:32:38] he's not going to just take his will and
[1:32:41] impress it into your life
[1:32:43] you have to say I want what you want for
[1:32:45] me Lord
[1:32:46] and that is when your life changes your
[1:32:49] life changes when your thoughts change
[1:32:51] and they become the thoughts of God
[1:32:55] Romans 12 2 says and be not conformed to
[1:32:59] this world but be transformed
[1:33:03] by the renewing of your mind
[1:33:08] we literally become transformed by just
[1:33:10] thinking the right thoughts
[1:33:14] it you accept it right here brother
[1:33:17] Brian says your mind is the womb to your
[1:33:19] soul you accept it here the word comes
[1:33:21] down in here and it begins to make a
[1:33:23] difference in your life Jesus on the
[1:33:25] inside working on the outside you you
[1:33:27] can't you can't look at your mind as the
[1:33:30] outside
[1:33:37] as a man thinketh in his heart there is
[1:33:40] a part that has to free more agency
[1:33:42] right here in the middle middle of your
[1:33:44] soul
[1:33:46] you have to say God I want what you want
[1:33:48] I want your thought here
[1:33:52] you know we're trying to get Faith for
[1:33:55] things and change things and want things
[1:33:57] better in a life and all these things
[1:33:59] and we're not taking care of the what
[1:34:02] needs to be taken care of
[1:34:04] that's our our thoughts we can't be
[1:34:07] scattered up here and trying to
[1:34:08] straighten our life out
[1:34:12] no we have to be transformed by renewing
[1:34:15] our mind with the thoughts of God except
[1:34:18] I need more of the thoughts of God that
[1:34:20] you may prove what is that good and
[1:34:23] acceptable and perfect will of God
[1:34:28] the only way that our life the only way
[1:34:30] we're going to become more like Jesus is
[1:34:32] when our thoughts
[1:34:34] are subject to become more like Jesus
[1:34:37] amen
[1:34:40] amen it's through the thoughts that your
[1:34:42] life the very nature your very nature
[1:34:45] changes your thoughts play such an
[1:34:46] important process
[1:34:49] we it's not like it's a different part
[1:34:52] of us to where we can just think what we
[1:34:53] want to think and oh I'm going to have
[1:34:55] faith for the word I'm going to have
[1:34:56] faith for this I'm going to come to
[1:34:57] church I'm going to Faith for this and
[1:34:58] I'm going to believe for this and then
[1:35:00] our thoughts are just well it doesn't
[1:35:01] matter what I think it does matter amen
[1:35:04] does matter somehow this puzzle's got
[1:35:06] about to come together sometimes somehow
[1:35:08] we got to be able to become Overcomers
[1:35:11] and and become stronger in the things of
[1:35:13] God Amen
[1:35:14] all right this is our our last scripture
[1:35:17] here in second Corinthians chapter 5
[1:35:19] verse 17 therefore If any man be in
[1:35:21] Christ he is a new creature
[1:35:23] old things are passed away
[1:35:25] behold all things are become new and all
[1:35:30] things are of God
[1:35:32] so how are we going to become all of God
[1:35:35] when our thoughts are not all of God
[1:35:39] it's important
[1:35:41] it's important what we're thinking
[1:35:44] not what we're saying not what we're
[1:35:46] doing but what we're thinking
[1:35:49] because I I could be doing the right
[1:35:52] thing
[1:35:53] but my heart
[1:35:55] my thoughts
[1:35:57] are for the wrong motives
[1:36:00] my thought has to be I have to serve the
[1:36:03] Lord with the thought
[1:36:04] this with my hands that'll automatically
[1:36:07] happen
[1:36:08] right right but the thought has got to
[1:36:12] bring him glory
[1:36:13] that thought has got to please them that
[1:36:15] thought has got to worship him that
[1:36:17] thought has got to honor him that
[1:36:19] thought has to be him
[1:36:22] can you say Amen
[1:36:24] we are created for his pleasure right
[1:36:29] every day we need to get up and hold our
[1:36:31] our thoughts accountable
[1:36:35] if we become accustomed and satisfying
[1:36:38] with just hearing the word leaving and
[1:36:40] not putting it into practice we're just
[1:36:43] deceiving herself we're becoming a
[1:36:45] bigger deception
[1:36:48] of our own self we have nobody I don't I
[1:36:51] have no person on this planet to blame
[1:36:54] for my wrong than me
[1:36:56] [Music]
[1:36:59] and neither do all any of us so if we
[1:37:02] want to cry about our problems
[1:37:05] we want somebody to help us we need to
[1:37:08] Humble ourselves before the Lord
[1:37:11] you can only serve the Lord according
[1:37:15] to the accountability of your thoughts
[1:37:18] now remember that statement if you don't
[1:37:20] remember anything else you can only
[1:37:22] serve the Lord according to the
[1:37:24] accountability that you you hold your
[1:37:27] thoughts accountable
[1:37:30] I say that right you can only serve the
[1:37:33] Lord according to the accountability of
[1:37:35] your thoughts
[1:37:36] so the more you hold your your thoughts
[1:37:38] accountable
[1:37:39] the more successful you'll be in serving
[1:37:41] the lord
[1:37:42] and the more it doesn't matter what you
[1:37:44] think it only matters what you do the
[1:37:46] more you'll go back into the same old
[1:37:48] same old
[1:37:51] so when we say for me and my house we'll
[1:37:52] serve the Lord what we're really saying
[1:37:54] is I am holding my thoughts accountable
[1:37:58] right for me in my house this house
[1:38:01] this house that God dwells in
[1:38:04] we're going to serve the Lord
[1:38:07] not just the body outwardly right
[1:38:10] but the thoughts inwardly
[1:38:13] how many religious people have fought
[1:38:15] Wars
[1:38:16] killed people thinking they were serving
[1:38:18] God
[1:38:21] they never wanted to hold themselves
[1:38:23] accountable
[1:38:24] Believers today are are serving the lord
[1:38:26] but they're not holding their thoughts
[1:38:28] accountable
[1:38:28] we've got to hold our thoughts
[1:38:31] accountable let's choose to serve the
[1:38:34] Lord every day by the way we think
[1:38:39] so I guess for some of us it's a new way
[1:38:41] of serving the lord
