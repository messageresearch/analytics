let's just look to the lord and give him thanks for this longing heavenly father we want to we want to thank you that you've placed a desire in our heart today to want to be in your presence you know that your presence would be amongst just two or three that would be gathered together in your name you said you would be there in the midst lord you are an invisible god we cannot see you with our natural eyes but lord there is uh there is a sense a sixth sense that uh tells us that your presence is here we already feel it lord and in fact your word declares that you inhabit the very praises of your people and we have worshipped you we've praised you and we've lifted your name up and lord we feel your presence even more now and we thank you for that we thank you for giving us the desire to to cultivate this atmosphere that you would come amongst us and help us and meet our needs and lift us up and direct our lives and point us in the direction that you'd have us to walk and father we pray now that you'd come in the ministry of the word and lord as you you minister lord you're aware you're aware of the needs that are in our life you're aware of of the longings the desires and the things that need to be met lord and you're the only one you're the only one that can meet them that's why we're here today lord we're not in every now that it's some some counseling some some shrink some some doctor lord we've come here because we believe that you are the answer to every need that we would have in our lives so we pray that we could recognize you in the opening of the world as you speak personally to our hearts lord we commit the service now into your hands and we pray for your blessings and your anointing upon the word of god and upon this vessel and upon the vessels that hear the word of god today and we give you the glory for it now in jesus christ precious name amen amen turn with me if you would the book of hebrews chapter 3 want to say it's as brother mark a great blessing to see brother ron amongst us amen we've missed him and of course we miss everyone when they're gone it's just part of the family amen so those that you don't see in church today i want us to to remember to pray for them amen that they will be here amen we uh that are strong bear the infirmities of the weak and and through prayer god answers your prayer amen hebrews chapter 3 verse 1 wherefore holy brethren partakers of the heavenly calling consider the apostle and the high priest of our profession christ jesus who was faithful to him that appointed him as same as moses was faithful in all his house for this man was counted more worthy of i'm sorry counted worthy of more glory than moses and as much as he who have builted the house have more honor than the house so moses was a great man but god created moses for every house is builded by some man but he that built all things is god and moses was very faithful in all his house as a servant for a testimony of those things which were to be spoken after but christ as a son over his house whose house are we this is what the scripture has to do this morning where that it involves us whose house are we if we hold fast the confidence and rejoicing of the hope firm unto the end amen amen and then one more scripture reading in chapter 12 of the same book or chapter 11 i mean chapter 11. hebrews chapter 11 verses 1 through 6. now faith is the substance of things hoped for the evidence of things not seen we might say that faith is missing i'm sorry hope is missing a substance that faith has and we all have hope right okay but faith grabs a hold of the situation brother branham said like this it's it's burly it's it's strong it's got hair in its chest faith uh is anchored and hope is still searching where to anchor so it is the evidence of things not seen so we're not gonna see this faith but it's it's it's real for by it the elders obtained a good report and through faith we understand that even god framed the uh the whole world together so that the things which were not uh which were made of things which do not appear so he used a face something invisible to create the worlds this pulpit was created but it was created by something that was already tangible god created the wood god created everything through something invisible that was called faith and by faith abel offered unto god a more excellent sacrifice than cain he was able to come to church and offer what pleased god more than cain when he came to church by which he or uh obtained a witness that he was righteous god testified of his gifts and by it he being dead yet speaketh by faith enoch was translated that he should not see death and was not found because god had translated them and this is important for us for before the translation of the rapture he had a testimony that he pleased god so how do i do that verse 6 says for without faith it's impossible to please him for he that cometh to god must must believe that he is and that he's a rewarder of them that diligently seek him amen man god bless you as you as you're seated and may god just quicken this word to us the bible says if we see first the kingdom that all other things will be added and he is a rewarder if we want things uh to to be better in our lives uh we have to put god first and we have to believe that the only thing god is looking for us is to love him with everything that we have and he'll take care of everything in our lives now i want to entitle this message a cultivating faith cultivating faith we know faith comes from god we can't force god to tell us anything true but we can cultivate him doing it and that's the part that we play now this is a very uh powerful scripture in hebrews chapter 3 verse number 6 but christ as a son over his own house whose house we are if those two words i know we're christians i know we're believers but we need to hold the confidence hold fast the confidence and the rejoicing of the hope firm to the end we can't just rejoice that we've been baptized that's just the beginning now the trials start now the testing start but that's all part of the plan of building our character we can't do away with the trials but through those we need to keep rejoicing of the hope firm unto the end hold fast of that confidence this shows that you're putting god first when you just kind of let go and all the things begin to bother you and you can't find up and down and you don't know what to do and you're just scrambling that shows that you've taken your eyes off of the prize you've taken your eyes off who started the work in you and we need to be confident that he's going to finish the work but in order for that to happen you got to keep your eyes glued on the lord and we can do this by cultivating faith we want to consider this morning the apostle and high priest of our profession and just cultivate faith in christ it's a real substance it's not something imaginary it's not something you just try to think of it's not a good idea that you came up with it's not up one week and down the next it's it's not that god used me this moment and the next moment you can't even see where god's at your situation that is not faith that is hope there's a difference faith is important in order for an elder to obtain a good report he has to stay faithful you're not going to get the right report unless you can stand the test amen faithfulness is the principle attribute that god is looking for we can only remain his house if we hold fast the confidence and the rejoicing of the whole firm to the end did not jesus say he that he that endure it to the end the same shall be saved so it's it's not it's not easy it's not gonna be a gift we're gonna have to learn through the process to get to the end to cultivate the faith we can't just come to church plop in church and expect to feel like we're enthused more about god when we leave amen we have a strong part to play that's right amen the word cultivate means trying to develop to pursue to foster to nurture or encourage that's something we do amen and when we cultivate something we're actually applying oneself to improving or developing so when we cultivate faith we must apply ourselves to improving it to developing it amen even though faith comes from god we are the ones that cultivate it we are the ones that cry out to god i need you lord amen we're living in perilous times the world's falling apart right before our eyes you don't even want to look at the news it's so discouraging professed believers are becoming more unthankful more ungrateful more of a bolster heady high-minded they're actually traitors they say one thing and do another they're more in love with themselves than ever before in history and jesus said because their iniquity the love that they once had would wax code in other words it would go in a museum in something that you could visit every now and then and say this is what it used to be jesus said in luke 18 8 he says i tell you that when when he will uh i tell you that he will avenge them speedily nevertheless when the son of man comes to get his bride shall he find faith on the earth he poses it as a question see the devil is always trying to tell you tell us tell the world they have enough that's right and i just can't seem to ever get that if i'm being honest with myself i just don't feel that i got it and i think that just helps me to keep pressing into it i say that faith is dwindling in our hour it's shrinking more and more believers are are trying to live off the knowledge of faith rather than faith amen our faith is is being tried like never before come on there got to be a lot of amens to that one i i think our faith is being tried like never before peter said it like this he said in first peter chapter 1 verse 7 that the trial the trial or the trustworthiness of your faith being much more precious than of gold that perish it though it be tried with fire might be found into the praise and honor and glory at the appearing of jesus christ think of the times that jesus berated others for not believing even when he he he he resurrected and he saw his own two disciples on the walking of the road to demand he says oh you fools and slow of heart to believe all the word of god oh not these things to beli to to to to happened and and here he the verse is saying that that our faith could be at a place that when he appears we're not like that but that were it would be uh to the honor and glory at the appearing that god could look at us and say well done you you've held the test you believed you you went forward peter is taking the one thing in life gold that's been the most prized possession throughout history thing that we know and he's saying that the trial or the trustworthiness of your faith is so much more precious than that of gold so god is looking at how our attitude and our fa and our faith in him through everything is more important than what we do every day when we get them go to work go get some money so we can pay the bills while the world is prizing oil today diamonds gold the believer is prizing the opportunity of a trial because that's what brings about character character is not brought about coming and sitting in these seats that's right amen if if coming to church made you a genuine christian then going and living in a barn would make you a horse so we've got to take the word of god apply it to our lives we've got to about to show it's it's inside our flesh doesn't like going through trials but every ounce of god's character is built off the foundation of faith it's not a gift god views the trying of our faith more precious think about that we're so tempted to murmur grumble and complain and god says i'm providing you an opportunity to to trust in me verse 8 who having not seen you love in whom though now you see him not yet believing you rejoice with joy unspeakable and full of glory amen if we hold the beginning of our confidence steadfast to the end if we hold on and keep rejoicing firm to the end don't wait till you feel like it this this hope i'll be honest with you the bible says christ in you the hope of glory we're not there yet and if you had a revelation you'd be there [Laughter] i don't i don't mean i don't mean it wrong but you can't experience uh the love of god without possessing it you can you can't experience him being born again without ex without experiencing it and how are we gonna experience i'm in heaven without being there so it's christ in you the hope of glory i'm going somewhere i'm not right now receiving the end of your faith verse 9 even the salvation of your souls faith is the beginning and what you're believing for comes in the end faith is the foundation it moves you off of the foundation to the end result amen you're no longer on a sinking sand when you hear from god not only is our faith being tried today but the devil he's actually working at eating at our faith right shoving all the ungodly media right in our face constantly reminding all of us of all the problems that are going on in their life hammering us of all their faults and failures tearing us down and eating away at our faith little by little trying to get us to even question god where are you lord the devil is walking around seeking whom he may devour and satan is trying to sift us like wheat that wasn't just peter trying to sift us all these things they give us major reasons that we need to be fighting for the faith to earnestly contend for the faith to cultivate faith in our personal lives satan is not going to give up on trying to destroy you it doesn't matter it doesn't matter what you do he's not going to give up so you're going to have to learn to protect your heart protect your soul tell the devil to get back this is holy ground you're unholy devil get out of my life now as long as satan can offer you something you want he's got an open door to tear you down first timothy chapter six verse nine first timothy chapter six verse nine but they that will be rich this is just one thing but you know because the love of money is the root of all evil money gets you what you want so but they that will be rich fall into a a temptation and a snare and into many foolish and hurtful lusts which drown men in destruction tradition of course when satan says look you got some money coming we get all excited but the scripture is telling us that it opens the door for a man just drowning in water help me i'm gonna die because when you've got money you've got power to make decisions and do what you want to do and you know what that don't mean a hill of beans what means everything is lord what would you have me to do that's what's important but money allows you to cross that border because now you know we feel he's given us an open door to go do what we want to do with her money for the love of money is the root of all evil which while some covenant after they have erred from the faith erred from the faith and have pierced themselves through with many sorrows going after things it all starts with the desire for something we do not have and it becomes an open door to air from the faith now we don't think it can hurt us it could bother us but it's just as wrong as wrong can be now the scripture says but thou o man of god praise god for men and women of god he said flee these things flee this desire for more and follow after what's important righteousness godliness faith love patience meekness fight the good fight of faith lay hold of eternal life we're into our called and has professed a good profession before many witnesses consider the high priest of our profession amen now just because we have professed a good profession among many witnesses it doesn't mean we don't have to keep fighting the good fight of faith we got to continue to fight amen we've got to continue to put the whole armor of god out we've got to continue to cultivate faith to keep professing the right profession yes amen now a lot of times we're not professing the right thing and what's bad about that is faith won't come if we're not professing the right profession don't be negative don't grumble murmur complain don't allow the devil to frustrate you and to get you off the right profession amen and i i say for this word you can just interchange it with confession what comes out of your mouth what you confess with your mouth what you confess is what you will become if you don't get serious about letting the mind of christ in letting the right thoughts in the devil has a chance to devour your faith and before you know it you'll be looking back and say i used to i used to i used to well god didn't change his word didn't change what's changed is our attitude and and and our faith if the bible says you got to fight the good fight and you got to lay hold and faith is a seed it it grows right it is the word of faith that god gives you it's a seed and it grows it's like a mushroom the more you use it the more it exercises and and if we could look at at brother mark well we we know he cultivates his muscles brother brother uh brother marty was another one that was just always strong when he touched him there was no mush but if you touch my tummy there's no muscle there's no six pack five pack no pack because it hasn't been exercised i just lay there and think about how good it would be to have and you know you could sit here and just wish you had faith but wishing you had faith to move mountains faith should get this thing out of your life faith you get closer faith to lay down your life faith to win souls it don't get the job done you got to cultivate it cultivate faith philippians chapter 4 verse 8. we're going to say a little bit on this thought finally brethren whatsoever things are true whatsoever things are honest whatsoever things are just whatsoever things are pure and lovely and of a good report then you can talk about it then you can think about it but if they ain't a good report ain't lovely ain't make you feel good you know it's not pure you don't have a business you don't have business thinking about it let alone talking about it we must follow god's pattern amen the pattern of correct thinking amen do you know just because we have the liberty and ability to think whatever we want to think and we don't have to answer to anybody it doesn't mean it's correct because as a man thinketh so is he but we don't want to be so is he we want to be so as christ we want the mind of christ we want to think correctly and i'll tell you we need to talk positivity no negativity we must hold fast the confidence and the rejoicing of the hope firm unto the end why because god can only work in the behalf of our confession of our faith if we begin to lose faith and confidence and trust then we're going to lose god's favor god's just going to step back without faith it's impossible to please god amen we need to consider more jesus christ the high priest of our profession if we confess negativity god can't do one thing for us remember that if we profess things are going bad things are not working out my situation keeps getting worse my problems are escalating our attitude will get worse and worse our faith will get weaker and weaker not because of god but because of us god isn't going to ignore our negative attitude and help us just because and i'll say it like this especially if you're a child of god why because god's trying to teach his children how to trust him how to grow up how to be strong during difficult times anybody can be a weakling but god is looking for somebody that will stand right in the midst of a lion's den of a fiery furnace of of a great trial in their life of giants in the land and say i'm standing with the lord that don't come with feelings and emotions if you want god to go to bat for you in your life you must learn to hold fast the confidence and the rejoicing of the hope firm to the end stare of difficulty in the eye like an old western movie they're standing there getting ready to have a a duel and that that that little theme that we've seen actually has been carried on to other movies just to show that there's going to be a fight and that's how it needs to be when you're facing difficulty like you're serious about this thing i'm ready to take on this thing i'm not afraid of it anymore amen what did god say to moses when he when moses was staring difficulty right in the face he said why cry speak unto the children of israel and tell them to move forward move forward bear where there's no there's no place to move every angle every side there is no way to go you must you remember this the rest of your life you must move forward in faith before your circumstances are going to move out of the way when they march forward in faith god changed their circumstance we're waiting for god to change his circumstance so we can say oh yeah i knew god was in it all the time anybody past is 2020. any vision of the past is 2020 but if you've got such good vision you should better look forward and say god's going to move this mountain god's going to move this circumstance because i'm moving forward in christ march forward in your faith cultivate your faith and god will change your circumstance when god delivered them to the red sea with a mighty deliverance they came through on the other side and what they were what were they doing they were rejoicing were they not dancing rejoicing talking about how great their god was they just the bible says that they actually got baptized in the red sea and then they came to church and they rejoiced of god's great power in their lives but it didn't last long it was short-lived what happened to the children of israel what happened to the believers that were following the message of the hour in that day they began to murmur and they complained about their journey they didn't hold fast the confidence and the rejoicing of the hope firm to the end they let it slip right through them brother sister it's not he that begins the race it's he that finishes the reward goes to the believer who finishes jesus said he that endure to the end that's the one i'm saving so i'll bring you into remembrance after i saved the children of israel out of the land of egypt afterwards i destroyed them that believed not that did not hold their their their rejoicing of hope and their confidence firm to the end amen you think it's not a big thing can you imagine all the lies that satan told the children of israel you're okay don't worry about it this isn't fair you shouldn't have to go through this you're still a child of god children of god don't have to suffer like this even afterwards they when they made the decision we're not going over their attitude still remained like a carnal believer but we can still serve god over on this side they didn't leave the message in their mind but they never held on to the true message in their heart which was i've given you the promised land so don't let the devil tell you a different message don't let him misinterpret the right message to you stay with the word of the hour too many believers today they're not holding on with rejoicing come to church and they don't want to even praise god they're too dignified going through too many trials god sees my heart too many believers are walking without confidence today that god is really with them because they're not confessing professing their attitude too many believers are still coming to church but they're not believing the word personally for their heart in other words it's a good message something to learn by something that is is important but they're not taking the word for their their heart i'll say it like this we got a lot of purposes in our life but if you want to know what god's purpose is get last service god has a threefold purpose for his church and if we don't learn to give god the preeminence in our life we're never going to be used like we should be being used to restore the kingdom he's made his co-workers with him to restore the kingdom and the kingdom of god isn't in this building the kingdom of god is in the heart men and women god wants to use us for that amen believe the word the bible says so shall you be established but you've got to believe it personally for your lives too many believers like the children of israel the bible says in hebrews chapter 4 verse 1. look what happened let us therefore fear lest a promise be left us of entering into his rest any of you should come short of it wow we could have the same attitude the children of israel had i'm not going to come short god's with me see look i can testify my shoes don't wear out we're out he's leading me by his spirit every day for 40 years i can prove god's been with me come on i see the filler fire when i go to church for uh but they missed the message they were satisfied with how much god was with them instead of how much god should have been with them and hear the scriptures telling us that there is a rest they didn't enter into the rest and there is a rest and we need to fear unless we miss it too that ain't just for the young believers the weak believers the women no that's for every brother and sister in this church for unto us for unto us was the gospel preached as well as unto them but the word preached did not profit them even though faith comes by hearing they just heard naturally not being mixed with faith in them that heard it in other words when you come to church and you're hearing the word you need to be sitting there as if i'm here if i was the only one here this word is for me that's where it needs to be in your life if not you're coming for wrong reasons and it's it's all about emotions and feelings and what you can get for your natural life i'm telling we don't come to church to improve our natural lives but i've got lots of different tools that i could give you if you're just interested in in building your natural life we've got to believe the word for our lives personally if it's going to do any good now the first thing is believers we need to do is maintain the fear of the lord don't lose it without the fear we'll leave out part of the promise because the promise is for complete rest not partial the children of israel received part rest when they came out of egypt they didn't have that tyrant on on their back anymore they weren't being uh whipped didn't have to they weren't a slave anymore but they did not enter into the rest there were still more are you with me the promise that god has for us is his rest and we need all the promises of god to enter into the rest of god how many can say there's more of god for you all right the rest of god that's what we're here for too many believers are satisfied with the amount of rest they have and that's why they don't press in but look at verse 9 the same chapter hebrews 4 verse 9. there remaineth therefore a rest to the people of god not to the sinner not to the unbeliever but to the people of god for he that have entered into his rest have also ceased from his own works as god did from his you're no longer trying to accomplish living the life being a christian being in his image because christ has taken a hold of your life so much that when you look in the mirror of his word and you look in the mirror of his message you see a reflection of jesus christ that's the rest and anytime you can look in the word and you can look into the message and you see something that you're not doing you need a labor to enter into that let us therefore labor to enter into that rest lest any man fall after the same example of unbelief how many times does satan told us well we don't have to get real serious about that that is a real real thought and when you accept that god looks at that attitude it's not going to help you when you decide that you need help from god you know i i remember brother johnson saying from the pulpit he said just because somebody's not at church doesn't mean god hasn't preached the word to them because they chose not to be there doesn't mean god didn't give him the word and god will hold him accountable to it when god told the believers of moses to move forward into the promised land they said they couldn't because there were giants in the land there were only two believers who were willing to move forward because they moved forward in faith first the other ones didn't move forward in faith they continue to have a baby attitude of if god really wants us to have that land then he's going to move the giants out for me and when they get moved out and i can see it without faith in other words my sight then i'll go into the promised land until then i don't believe the message and we come to church because we don't feel we don't see we don't believe the word the word is still the word god didn't need something visible to create the earth and if we trust in him we shouldn't have to have something visible either we shouldn't have to have somebody just some playing your favorite song preaching your favorite listening to the the right tape reading the right scripture no god is god he's in everything and we need to humble ourselves have the fear of god that he's trying to speak to us i believe it with all my heart joshua and caleb were the only two that entered into the rest of god they had ceased from thinking that they had to take care of the giants on their own right where the others said you know we can't do that but god never asked you to do that he just asked you to get in there walk forward by faith that god was going to take care of it whatever you got going on in your life and you think it is just way too hard that is just a lie from satan you can't find that in the true word of god god is able to make stones rise up as children of abraham he can certainly take you and deliver you from any situation and give you the rest of the promise of god but you've got to walk forward in faith you have to i love that they ceased from their own thoughts i know they said we're more than able but they didn't say we're more than able they said we're more than able there's a difference one was through faith and the other's through sight like peter pulling out a sword let's go put that thing away you're not thinking correctly they had entered into the rest of the word that god had promised them they didn't come short of it now look we see this is so easy for us to identify who the right characters are in this skit it was joshua and caleb i would take their side would you what side are you taking today have you been professing negativity have you been murmuring have you been complaining have you been saying this this this trial in the wilderness has just been get out of it stand up rejoice keep it firm hold your confidence to the end he would have begun a good work he's going to finish it don't let one negative thing come out of your mouth you know here's the problem and satan's got so many people messed up go home and murmur and complain about your problems and come to church and act like a christian go home and act like a christian be an inspiration there remains therefore a rest to the people of god i'm a person of god anything saints we ought to be struggling or laboring laboring's the right word but we ought to be laboring to enter into that to that place where we can look at the giants in our life and say god's going to take care of this situation he's got this handled it's under control i don't know how you know if you notice joshua and caleb didn't spell it out and say this is how god's going to do it he wants you to walk around the walls of jericho sometimes just do it right just do it may look foolish and still just do it god's doing it god will take care of the circumstance if you walk forward in faith no matter how silly it looks just keep going to church keep praying keep reading keep rejoicing blow the trumpets announce your god he's more than able just keep doing it he'll take care of the circumstance [Music] cultivate faith cultivate it to give you some down to earth things to do to cultivate faith just in case i want to put this in the middle of the sermon just in case i didn't get to it because you know i just history tells me that i don't get to the end of my sermons i wanted to leave this for the end but i want to stick it in here right now we want to start with the internal things that we can do inside and i'm going to say it's our attitude it starts inwardly but it's shown outwardly and i don't want us to underestimate the importance of maintaining the right attitude brother branham says in the message the right mental attitude towards any divine promise of god will actually bring it to pass that means you got to keep thinking pure just good report keep professing god is able the first thing i believe these are john martin things the first thing with a right mental attitude is humility humble yourself under the word of god you get time read james 4 6-12 humility is the first thing because he gives grace to the humble and he just resist the pride second thing inwardly repent of what brother john of all your murmuring all your complaining all your wrong confessions forget how bad it is in the wilderness and just the word says every man every man that come to god he must first be tried god wasn't making a mistake when the children of israel went went through that he was trying them he gave him so many opportunities but the promise that god has for the bride isn't for everybody there's only an elect that's why he calls him elect and and that's the one he chooses he chooses someone that's going to trust him above all the circumstances in the world amen god hates murmuring complaining i'll say it like this it is the evidence of one thing i want to say one thing today it's obviously evidence of many things but it's the evidence of one major thing where it starts from pride murmuring complaining comes from a heart that's proud and feels shouldn't have to do this it proves how unthankful we really are the third thing with our attitude is to make sure that you're willing to move forward and trust god because if if it's not there if you're not going to be willing to take that first step your attitude will never be right so willing to labor to really believe the word when it's preached to you personally that this word is for you you've got to be willing to submit to it an unwilling attitude will never ever cultivate the faith of god you can't you can't just have this relationship with god and say i'm going to believe what i want to believe and and hold on to what i want to hold on leave the church and then go have your personal life with god and expect god to meet you when he tried giving you a word when you were at church and you made little of his word right can you imagine having children and asking them to do something and this is what i want you to do and they only do half of it but then they come around and say can i have my ice cream can i my candy can in my allowance what is the first thing you say did you do you didn't do what i asked you to do do you think god's different that is no different we've got to cultivate faith these th these three things will cultivate faith when you have the mind of christ in you it'll cultivate faith when you're exercising the right mental attitude will cultivate this is what we can do inwardly with our attitude to cultivate faith the substance from god think about that you cultivate faith you're actually cultivating a substance that's going to come from god can you imagine if we all wanted a drink of water here and there was no water but by you having the right attitude that i know god's going to get it to us that's is really what's ushering the vehicle of god coming and giving it to you now what can we do outwardly to cultivate faith i say after we've rededicated i'm using that word rededicated our attitude to cultivate faith inwardly there's some things that we can do outwardly to cultivate faith now because you cultivated the inside first you're able to do this you're able to do this the first is well you don't have to be first i'm sorry these you put them in anywhere you want but you're gonna speak this word you're gonna profess it i'm going to spend more time praying i'm going to spend more time reading the word i'm going to spend more time listening to what the prophet taught i know that rapturing faith lies in those tapes i'm going to be faithful to god's house god is a rewarder to them that diligently seek him matthew 7 verse 7 says ask and it shall be given seek and you shall find knock and it shall be opened unto you and everyone that asketh receiveth and he that seeketh findeth them to him that knocketh it shall be open amen amen so that's why i'm going to be faithful that's why i'm going to seek him diligently and last but not least i'm going to worship the lord more your worship has everything to do with your attitude it starts inward and comes outside i'll tell you a lot of people they don't worship in church because something's not right on the inside you can stand behind that thing and say i worship god different but i'll tell you the bible says all ye that have breath praise ye the lord he makes the trees clap his hands he'll make the rocks cry out don't tell me you're worshiping god inside it'll come outside if you're worshiping god the bible says i will enter his gates with thanksgiving i will enter his courts with praise now satan's nature doesn't want you to exalt god satan said i will exalt my throne about the throne god what does satan's nature inside of us do i'm not going to exile i'm not going to praise god i'm not in a mood man you can't make me doesn't mean anything it's a satanic nature you need to deal with it it's a bad attitude isaiah 25 verse 1 says oh lord i know this isn't i'm just going to quote it real quick oh lord thou art my god i will exalt thee i will praise thy name for thou has done wonderful things find something to praise the lord for amen i'll tell you if the children of israel would have kept praising god that he he brought us out of egypt they wouldn't have been saying well man we had a better back in egypt psalms 118 verse 28 thou art my god i will praise thee now my god i will exalt thee oh give thanks unto the lord for he is good for his mercy and your friend i'll tell you if there's one thing we should all about to rejoice in when we come to church is we got new mercies today you know coming in church and not putting your heart into worship brother something's wrong with your attitude you're not going to cultivate any faith sitting here and hearing the word with these ears ain't going to give you faith but as we do these things faith will begin to grow genuine substance of faith will begin to grow in your heart and i'll tell you what it does this is god he'll take care of the giants that are in your life because you're entering into christ you know everybody knows i've said this before that there was a time in my life that i was unwilling to serve god well we all at one time in life was unbelievable to serve god but i'm a businessman i didn't know i was a businessman but we're all businessmen in some sort of way i made a deal with god that i would serve him if he gave me cheryl remember that that was a business deal i was making a business deal i would fulfill the word if he gave me what i wanted and that's a lot of us when we come to church i will worship you correctly if you put the feeling there if i have a good week i don't care if you had a fight on the way to church i'll tell you get it under the blood and come in and offer the sacrifice of praise he's worthy of all praise don't let anything stand in the way what did god tell moses every place that the soul of your foot shall tread upon that i've given you as i said unto moses joshua you must take the first step of faith and then i will take care of the giant circumstance i you you we must walk forward and possess not in your abilities remember this it's in your faith your abilities don't mean anything amen you know to me one of the saddest things is sit there and testify of all these things that god has done for us in our lives and we're not being faithful to him think about that god has shown himself so faithful to you so good to you and you can't be faithful to him i think that's so sad god wants us to enter into the rest of god and so god's telling joshua every place that the soul of your foot treads upon i've given you that amen well why don't you just give it to me no i'm not i'm not a daddy old grandpa you've got to take it by faith the kingdom of god suffered violence the violence taketh it by force what do they use faith faith in god that this word is real to me god is real to me this promise is real to me healing is real to me whatever it is that you're seeking for it's got to be real to you step out by faith walk forward in faith first then god will take care of your giant circumstance without faith god isn't going to give it to you god isn't going to meet the needs of a murmur and a complainer and you know what i'll just i'll say it like this you may be able to bite your tongue and not say anything negative anymore that's good but you got to deal with your heart the thoughts of your heart they've got to be without murmuring and complaining if god wants you to go through a trial lord not my will thine be done amen you're going to bring forth glory to you that's what's important to me you're going to use this vessel to show that i can stand here in the middle of this fire and i'm going to meet you just like the three hebrews did amen amen and god will meet you there if you trust god now those three human children weren't walking with a bunch of knowledge and know-it-all this is what god's gonna do i know what god's gonna do i know they didn't know they just trusted they just believed just believe it's about being serious god will try you draw an eye to god in faith and he'll draw nigh to you in circumstance [Music] don't wait for him to take care of the circumstance before you're going to praise god don't do that it isn't like you got to come in church and stand up at the pulpit and begin to say well i got uh these things are going on my run in my life but god's going to do this you don't got to do that but you can come into church and sit down and praise him just as if you did i hope you catch what i'm saying let your attitude be expressed in your worship amen loves to be worshipped he created angels to worship him what do you think he he just he created us to sit down and watch it all as entertainment no he created us to worship him too everything brings god glory and there's so many ways that we can do it my so many things that we could say here don't let the devil scare you and tell you it's too hard you can't do it you'll never change submit yourself therefore until the promise of god resists the devil and he'll flee from you i just i want to ask this question today who are the joshua and caleb's of this church who are the children in the wilderness that have forgotten the mighty deliverance move forward from where you've been living move forward in faith in attitude in doing the things that you need to do to cultivate faith faith will come deliverance will come healing will come joy will come love will come all that you need will come if you move forward in faith you've got to cultivate it you got to cultivate it friends i know there's nothing there is such a great blessing when we get an evangelist up here and he's just like fired away on the promises of god it's enjoyable it really is but you know what i've seen it more times than not by the time the next service comes nobody comes hardly nobody comes to church early getting in late all down in the dumps what three days later we need to learn to cultivate faith that's something we do at home so when we get here the atmosphere is so easily created we don't gotta you know hope you know the song leader you know does good for us you know we need to learn to be prepared for god be prepared for god if you're just coming to church be prepared for church whatever but but be get prepared for god if if look if you're gonna go out on a date with god i tell you you would get some rest you'd put on your best dudes duds dudes you would have your best attitude you want to be sharp and you want to be able to pay attention to what he's saying he wouldn't come in half here and expect you know well just doing my duty we need to cultivate faith friends it starts at home the cultivating is at home amen well we're going to have to there's many examples in the bible and we've heard them before we got three hebrew children they didn't murmur and they didn't complain about their circumstance you can't find it they weren't afraid they didn't tell the king oh yeah i got all this figured out no they didn't and they didn't try to figure it out either they didn't try to understand everything but they kept the right attitude they simply rested in god's grace they walked forward in to the fire in faith amen they didn't say i'm not going to go through that trial i'm not going to do that sometimes god just forces us circumstances beyond our control right i i can't imagine the three hebrew children would have went into that thing if if they had a choice but god didn't give him a choice but through this trial of their faith it was more precious than the gold yes so when you're going through something you have an opportunity to bring god more glory than you can without the trial so cultivate faith cultivate faith because you're going to need it for the trials to come let's stand together may the lord bless you there's there's so many things and i i i i just i can't i we can't do it all i say it like this read the bible go go home read the bible and god will show you amen cultivating faith amen i i couldn't help but to think about that one song that my wife was playing there and our brother mark there is a place there is a place there remains a rest for the people of god i'll say it like this brother branham told us to put the shell in the gun and fire it if it don't hit the bullseye put another one in
