TRANSCRIPT
========================================
because they're my children and that will never stop i just feel it i may look at my age and i but it will never stop and i don't believe that god is ever going to stop rebuking me that would be saying like god stop loving me and so if there's anything that i need to do is be zealous fervent about repenting about the things that he says to me behold i stand at the door of man's heart and if any man hear my voice and open the door i will come to him and will sup with him and he with me god is a gentleman about getting us ready for a rapture that's true change is necessary for a rapture god is not going to squeeze us into getting ready he loves us so much that he will correct us but it's up to us to recognize that he is knocking at our door we don't want to come to church unpersonal we don't want to come to church as if we're just trying to gather some information pick a few things out that's going to help us individually but we need to come because this is where god promised to meet you personally behold i stand at the door of your heart and not just what gentlemen do a gentleman will stand there all night just he'll wait if you recognize that it's the voice of jesus speaking to you you recognize it's god speaking to you and you turn to obey him whatever that voice speaks to you at that point you are building your relationship with god you cannot expect god to build your relationship then he would be unjust for not building everybody else's we are the ones let's take the word do it and build the relationship and if we build that relationship he says i will come to him and will sup with him and he with me see that beautiful relationship i will stand upon my watch and set me upon the tower and watch to see what he will say to me and what i shall answer when i am reproved we're going to answer somehow we're either going to say amen lord so be it to me or we're going to say that's not for me i'm not receiving that i'm not going to accept that now this hour that we're living in it's a dangerous hour it's the most dangerous of all time the most deceptive it's the darkest hour that man has ever lived in brother branham when he saw this age it went into complete darkness we're living in horrific horrific perilous times as it was in the days of noah where nothing but evil was continually on man's heart as it was in the days of lot homosexuality and perverseness is just on a rampage the love of many jesus said is waxing cold hatred is rampant it was brought up in our men's meaning how terrible hatred is it's just growing jesus warned us to stand upon our tower as we see the day approaching not just with church attendance but getting more serious about the coming of the lord one of the biggest deceptions that satan has put on the church today is that they're already ready enough notice the way that i said that they're already enough no one's going to say i'm completely there but so many people are going to say i got the main shebang it's the biggest one of the biggest deceptions matthew chapter 24 verse 42 jesus said watch therefore for ye know not what hour your lord doth come why doesn't he say hey to those who aren't ready watch but to those that who are ready you know you're okay you're already in but you know satan preaches that gospel to us you know you've got baptized right you've repented you're ready it's amazing how the devil wants to take the word of god and twist it but know this that if the good men of the household would have known what watched the thief would have come he would have watched and would have not suffered his house to be broken up therefore be also ready for in such an hours that you think the not of man cometh wow talk about distractions when we're thinking that jesus may come we're going to make different decisions when we think he's not going to be coming we're going to make so many plans when we see the signs out there and we see the signs but when we're comparing ourselves with those out there we feel ready but what we need to do is we need to be comparing with what he's speaking to our heart that's the scripture because this is what's going to get us ready it's not going to get me ready looking at all those in the bars all the drunks all the dry addicts looking at all those people and and feeling better that's not going to make me ready what's going to make me ready is whatever he speaks to my heart take that serious and it's so personal i don't even know what it is it's between you it's between god and you isn't that beautiful it's beautiful it's learning how to commune when jesus speaks to your heart how to respond back so beautiful watch therefore keep awake be vigilant when you're standing on that tower and you're watching for what he's going to be speaking to you spiritually stay fully awake brother brandon said pinch your conscience be sober be vigilant this is how you need to be on the tower you can church church church pretty soon it'll be over i'll get something out of it when we come to god's house in the flesh our flesh does not want to hear what god's really going to speak to us i'll i'll say like this he doesn't want to hear god's reproof that's right sometimes we even battle whether or not it's worth going that's true come on now i'm not saying that's how everybody feels all the time that's not what i'm saying but you can get so far from where you need to be with your walking in the spirit of god that you could actually think like that but when you're walking in the spirit we simply can not wait to get there that's it there's no in between and as brother bran said we come to find out where we're at with god that's why we can't wait to get there not in a carnal sense of have we been bad but in a spiritual sense how can i please him how can i make him more happy how can i how can he put a smile on his face just all depends on where we're at i was glad when they said unto me let us go let us go to the house of the lord and i believe the holy spirit says that to us let us go to the house of the lord amen psalms 27 verse 4 one thing have i desired of the lord and that will i seek after that i may dwell in the house of the lord all the days of my life to behold the beauty of the lord and to inquire in his temple i will see how i will answer when i am reproved if you're in the flesh you're going to answer quite different than when you're in the spirit so i wonder i will see how i will answer isn't it you know brother branham said it's not the action it's not what god speaks but it's how we react to the situation it's not the action that counts but the rea i thought god would just come down and put his hand over me and just heal me in my leprosy why do i gotta go down there to those dirty waters see it wasn't the action what god told naaman but it's how he was reacting he was in the flesh when he came to church and through the singing through the praise through the worship god i'm thinking better amen thinking well the lord could have asked me to do something that would be almost impossible for me to do so i think i'm just going to run with it just run with it no matter what god speaks to you run with it you need it put it in practice when you recognize god is standing at the door to your heart and speaking to you no one else is hearing this no one else is hearing it it's your personal vision [Music] it's no longer eyes are here the eyes are here god's speaking to our hearts what will we do when he speaks to us what we do with it take the vision make it plain on the table of your heart in other words open the door and write it on your heart say amen so be it unto me according to thy word lord the lord is not reproving us because he's trying to just make a perfectionist out of us carnally like what we would think about one another he dislikes so many things that we think about so many things that we we do and we make excuses for but yet we judge others [Music] i mean there's many things that god wants to say to us but we can't bear it remember growing up and our oldest brother or friends in the neighborhood they would oh you're just a baby you can't take it i dare you and they were trying to get you to do something that you normally wouldn't do well god wants us to take it take the word and run with it amen not play with it not say amen and then don't do nothing with it it's dangerous second corinthians chapter three verse two second corinthians chapter three verse two for as much as ye are manifestly declared to be the epistles of christ ministered by us written not with ink but with the spirit of living god not in tables of stone but in fleshly tables of heart known and read of all men make it plain upon the tables of your heart it's got to go there it can't just go one one ear and out the other it can't just stay in the brain it needs to sink down to the heart it needs to be written there why does it need to be written there verse 2 and the lord answered me and said write the vision and make it plain upon tables that he may run that read it when people see that it's become your life and they read your life it's a an epistle manifestly declared to be jesus christ they know what to do they will run with it that's why you put it there so other people can read it you already got such a special relationship with god you come to church with the understanding that real things happen at church real things happen real changes happen but the person out there that don't know god they don't know they've never experienced this before but when they see it living in you because you took it and you wrote it right here you go out and you manifest it then they see it and they want to run with it too they want what you got brothers and sisters we're in a race most people are oblivious to it they're stuck in lukewarm state of laodicea but we need to make it plain where we're standing with god and where we're standing with what god spoke to us when other people read our lives they will join the race that's what we want we want them to join the race because if they don't they're going to perish without a vision the people perish when you hear god speak to you that's god's vision for you god visualizes you to take this word become this word eat this book right this is the vision if you don't take that vision out and live it amongst people they will die all of us are going to save somebody amen all of us are going to save somebody they're not going to get saved unless you have that vision and i i like what our brother larry said he says if i'm doing it nothing's going to avail to it but if the lord's doing it in me something's going to happen right brother and that's christ in us the hope of glory the hope of anyone reaching glory is christ in us hebrews chapter 12 verse 1 foreseen we are compassed about what's so great a cloud of witnesses let us lay aside every weight and the sin which just so easily beset us and let us run with patience the race that is set before us there are things in every one of our lives that are slowing us down weights that keep us from running hard with the lord jesus we need to think about those weights because they're all different for us i don't got the problem you got you don't got the problem i got but to both of us they are weights and weights they're like magnets to our flesh they hold us down we need to cut them off we need to get rid of them we need to pray one for another when you pray for john martin don't just pray for the for the ministry god bless john marlon cut those weights off lord amen i need my weights cut off it is our responsibility to lay aside every weight not god's don't expect god to come here and just do it all for you kind of relationship is that let me just take your personal relationship for a minute brother mark i'm sorry you're not married you can't be in this one but every one of us that is married there's times that our significant other our partner the other sex i want to make is clear that when i say partner i'm not meeting case anybody's watching this down the road but there's some times that your husband or your wife wants you to do something and what they're asking you to do is not as easy as flipping a coin it hurts it's painful it takes time it takes money it takes working extra hours whatever but it's the right thing to do because it's love don't expect god to do something that you can be doing lay it aside whatever he reproves lay it aside run with it don't battle it don't debate it don't go if as soon as you go into the the battle of reasoning you lost i don't care how long you're there you lost we've got to cast down reason every thought that exalteth itself against the knowledge of god against the will of god for our lives cast it down amen run with what god gives you amen don't ignore the race that's set before you don't miss your day of visitation and i'll say this each and every time you come to church god is going to visit you and do not expect him to to build this whole thing up and make you feel good and give you your favorite scripture and and and and give you everything that you're asking for i've been coming church long enough to know that god does not give me everything i'm asking for well brother john what's the problem well maybe i'm not walking uprightly maybe what i'm wanting isn't the right thing for me there could be a lot of reasons i'm not getting maybe it's not the right time but i do know this that god is here and he's got something for me and that's all that really matters focusing on what god has in our visitation very important don't run the race with weights don't try to do it don't mix it together don't mix it with weights of doubt or questions or uncertainties just take the word and run with it get the weights off you so you can run faster so you can endure more so you can overcome more so you can endure hardness as a good soldier jesus christ lay aside the things that god is telling you to lay aside that's what reproof is the reproof that he's speaking to your heart answer him with a sincere amen and run with it run with it run with it run with it we've got to think about the relationship part can i can't imagine my wife asking me to do something for years and never doing it and expect that to be a normal relationship how long has the lord been asking us to do something and we call that normal relationship we got to run with it looking unto jesus the author and finisher of our faith for the joy that was set before him he endured the cross despising the shame and to set down the right hand of throne of god for consider him that endured such contradiction of sinners against himself lest ye be wearied and faint in your minds you have not resisted unto blood striving against sin right it hasn't been as bad as what god has gone through and you have forgotten the exhortation which speaketh unto you as unto children my son despise not the chastening of the lord nor faint when you're reproved of him a lot of ways we can faint faint can just be ignored service will be over shortly put your mind on other things not deal with it kick the can down the road for whom the lord loveth he chasteneth and scourges every son that he receiveth we come to church we want to be received i want to be received of the lord every time we bring a sacrifice and offer we want him to to accept it we bring the sacrifice of praise and worship it's not just at the beginning when you give your heart to the lord if you endure chastening god is dealing with you as with sons so when he speaks to you and you say lord oh help me and you do it yes that means you have a proper relationship with the father proper relationship with the father but let's but if you are without chastisement in other words i don't i'm not going to do that i don't have to do that ah don't you tell i want better preaching than that where we're called in the scripture not his son that's not the god does not have any children like that if you endure chasing god deal with your sons for what son is he whom the father chasteneth not is there any dads here that did not correct their children in any way let me see your hands oh let me see your hands if you stop correcting them after two years old after six years old after 10 why is it that we should feel the right that we can come to church and never corrected because we're so old in the lord when i go through these scriptures lord have mercy on me as he reveals things lord have mercy i'm not even worthy to come up here and speak this what is god saying here take god's word and write it on the table of your heart and run with it run out of here with it don't leave it here take it with you that he who reads your life may run with you that's where we're going with this you want to win a soul for the lord but if you don't take the chastisement you don't take what he's saying it won't go on your heart who's going to run with you who is it going to attract who are you going to attract and where are you going to take him to you're supposed to preach everything that god commands you to do i know that's hard god is looking for some serious runners who are willing to take what he says and run with it not it's not a time for us to be fainting taking it easy i know when i used to run long races used to run long distances there's a few things that you needed to finish strong the first is you needed patience you need to be patient because when you're running and you're huffing and you're puffing you want this thing over with it's it you could never get it over fast enough a long race a sprint is different but a long race it just couldn't get over fast enough so you needed patience another thing you needed was a goal you needed to focus on your goal because your body wanted to quit all the time and you needed a goal to focus on there's something at the end of this hardship that you're going through that you're going to be rewarded with that's the goal and you needed encouragement you that's the octane in the tank you needed people saying come on you can do it keep going you're almost there you got them keep going you needed that and we all had somebody cheering us on at one time or another well they were cheering brother random on when he was racing they said keep pressing keep pressing we're almost there thank god that we're almost home thank god that we only got to press a little bit longer but it's no time to stop pressing we need to be serious about running [Music] i want to encourage you today my dear fellow runners that there are other believers that have gone on before you previous runners they're looking over the banister from heaven at one time they had the baton and they were running and then they handed it to somebody and they went on to meet with the lord and they gave the baton to someone and then they gave it to someone and then they gave it to somebody and today in this age you're holding the baton that our forefathers in the spirit had run with you just don't know how it trinkled down but you've got it spiritually and you got to run with it be serious about this race you've got to hand it to somebody you got to get somebody saved they got to join the race you got to take the word write it plain on the tables of your heart that they that read your life can run with you oh how we need a revelation of that today we're foreseen we're also compassed about what's so great a cloud or witnesses let us lay aside every weight and this sin which just so easily beset us and let us run the race with patience that set before us you know too many people don't want to run they want to think that all i have to do is say i'm in the race i'd like to talk about two races if you're not doing well in the first race you're not a qualifier of the second you know how that goes you can't meet you can't get to the next race until you won the first one too many christians are simply too satisfied with just being in the first race they're not very interested in how they're running they don't care if they're running fast enough they don't care about so many things they don't care if they make it to church don't make it to church if they take the word don't take the word long as they're just in the race i'm a christian you know it's like brother ben taking doors out of the water they don't care if the water is out of the water they don't care if they're not rolling they don't care if they're they're not pressing in very hard they don't care if they've stopped praying real hard they've settled for a lukewarm run let's look at this first race in 1st corinthians chapter 9 verse 24 know ye not that they which run in a race run all but one receiveth the prize so run that ye may obtain now this is what's very difficult we all feel we've obtained so why do i need to run why do i need to try have we obtained or haven't we depends on what preacher you put behind the pulpit with that where they're going to go with that we all want to hear a preacher say you're in you've attained you're there you're predestinated it's gonna happen don't you worry about anything just take it easy but i'm trying to take that message and fit it into this brother branham says it's got to dovetail from genesis to revelations it's got to find its place i believe paul believed in predestination i believe he believed in eternal security i believe he believed in the seal of the holy ghost but i also believe that he said we need to run so we can obtain are you with me in this first race there's only one winner we've talked about it's either your flesh or your soul but only one wins you're the you that are in the race but running with little effort or trying only some of the time we definitely need a revelation that we haven't obtained yet that's the revelation we need i haven't attained if there's a revelation we need that's the one but we're searching for that revelation that i have attained right that's the if i speak in tongues i got it i've attained same spirit same spirit it's one word i proved it i spoke in tongues i've attained i got a revelation i'm yeah that's the right it all leads to doing nothing that's right what kind of runner is that right we need to run that we may obtain that means obtain something that we do not have right jesus said he that endureth to the end the same shall be saved he never said he that's got a revelation he that endureth because think about every single person that has backslidden from jesus christ maybe not every single one because there's still like real weak ones but i mean the ones that have been looked like they were solid for a while all felt they had a revelation that they're in it for nothing's going to happen kind of like peter i'll die for you right so it doesn't matter how we feel about the subject what matters is we just take it and run with it run the race as if you haven't attained so run that ye may obtain the prize it's no time to make your victory lap i'm there i made it i do i'm in that's right yeah that's right no time to act like a christian who's already attained philippians chapter 3 verse 12 paul said not as though i've already attained either already perfect but i follow after if i may apprehend that for which i've also operand of jesus christ who which also i am apprehended jesus christ brethren i count not myself to have apprehended for this one thing i do i'm forgetting those things which are behind and reaching forth for those things which are before i press towards the mark for the prize for the of the high calling in christ jesus look at these words i haven't retained i don't count myself apprehended i forgetting those things are be behind i'm reaching forth i press towards the the mark i'm looking for a prize of a high calling this is the race and this is what we need to be feeling in our souls and when we feel it so strong in our souls it's easy to come to church and hear what the lord is going to speak to us without being bent out of shape feeling so defeated you know what what god is having to do he's having to fight off the spirits that you let in your heart and mine you let the devil sweet talk you into a lukewarm walk and then god's got to speak from the pulpit you know what i love about this and i feel so free i never know what the lord's doing brother ron but i i have a revelation that god deals with our hearts and that's all that matters he can take a word and if if the spirit of the word the life of christ is through that word it will go and reach the mark but it has to be the spirit there that's why it's important to yield it's no time to be running around like a peacock showing off that you've already attained look at verse 15 let us therefore as many as be perfect be thus minded and if anything and if in anything you be otherwise minded god shall reveal this unto you in other words god is going to speak to you about that subject he's going to somehow get it across to you that you ain't ready yet you need to humble yourself and come and receive gold tried in the fire amen amen brother brahm said in the message expectation brother samson it sent this to me and maybe some of the others got it as well he said in the message expectation there's one thing that jesus christ lacked in his life he says i hate to say that but he did jesus lacked one thing a modern showmanship [Laughter] he wasn't a show-off no everybody today's got to have a great big uh headlines and bragging about what they're doing that's a stuffed shirt that's right that's not a servant of god a servant of god will be humble and keep himself back i'm pressing towards the mark don't be a stuff shirt press towards the mark let's get back to first corinthians chapter 9 verse 24 know ye not that they which run in a race run all but one receiveth the price so run that ye may obtain so in this first race here we see that as jesus said he that tries to save his life is going to lose it that's the race you've got to give up this life for eternal life that's a you've got to give up this life for eternal life what does that mean brother john you got to give up what you want to do in this life to receive eternal life you can what what what jesus said you could gain the whole world lose your soul what what did you get out of it so every man that striving for the mastery is temperant and all things but they do it to obtain a corruptable crown so i got this little corruptable crown here striving for a corruptable crown i remember i was so great when i won this it's not even mine i'm borrowing it's my father-in-law's i don't even i don't think i have any more trophies but they do it to obtain this yeah but we incorruptible in other words it's a crown that stays with you forever for eternity it's called eternal life i therefore shall run not as uncertainly not as one sulfide not as one that beateth the air but i keep my i keep under my body and bring it into subjection let's by any means when i preach to others i myself should be a castaway we've got to bring those thoughts and things in our life that constantly and will continually try to creep into our lives and bring it into subjection when god speaks to our heart when he rebukes us when he reproves us just run with it don't take it and kind of leave it in the car for a couple weeks don't write it down and just keep it in your bible case and then you forget about it run with it obey it i know time is running short here but i want to talk about the second race because if you're running in the first race you're a qualifier for the second race and it's not for everybody you got to have the correct mindset the right attitude you got to be pressing towards the mark you got to be you got to have the the the mindset that i'm not there and i i gotta get all that's what you need for the second race let's go back to first corinthians chapter nine verse six first sixteen now paul is talking about a reward remember at the at the end of this which we read at the beginning only one receives the prize though all one run only one receives a prize so he's starting out talking about a reward for though i preach the gospel i have nothing to gloria for in necessity for necessity it is laid upon me yea woe is unto me if i preach not the gospel for if i do this thing willingly i have a reward now what is that reward okay you're you're you're we're gonna see this at the end if you do it willingly you have a reward preach the gospel talk about preaching the gospel here but if against my will a dispensation of the gospel is committed unto me what is my reward then there's no reward if you're doing this because you have to fairly that when i preach the gospel i make the gospel of christ without charge that i abuse not my power in the gospel can you imagine trying to share brother ron was in the men's meeting trying to show us what it's like sharing the gospel of jesus christ without charge and he was saying yes you know you can come to know jesus or is that brother mike it was both of you maybe i know his brother ron oh yeah witness yeah you know you might want to try it you know it's no believing in it yourself no charge no it's life or death no you're going to hell if you don't accept jesus christ as your savior it's without charge what's your reward now look he steps into verse 19. for though i be free from all men he's talking about his willingness now i make myself a servant unto all that i might gain some i'm by making the more so people who are not willing to do this willingly they won't be a servant the only way they're going to win somebody it was with the comfortability of their their hammock their cell phone yeah no suffering just you know i want to invite you to church all right yeah yeah i want you to come no won't be a servant won't serve just gonna not do it willingly paul is willingly showing how to get the prize for though i be free from all men i made myself servant and all that i might gain the more in unto the jew i became as jew that i may gain the jews to them that are under the laws as under the law that i may gain them there under the law to them that are without the law is without law but not without the law to god but under the law of christ that i might gain them that are without the law to the weak became i as weak that i might gain the weak i made all things to all men that by that i might by all means not just the hammock and the cell phone that i may that i might by all means save some now here's the catcher and this i do for the gospel sake that i might be partaker with you now keep the same same mindset as we read the scriptures know ye not that they which run in a race run all but one receiveth the prize so run that ye may obtain paul knew he said i do this i am going to serve you i am going to do everything i can to win you to christ that i might be a partaker with you now we know that the the prize is eternal life which is jesus christ but i can be a partaker of his crown brother brandon says you're attached to it throughout eternity now we're here today to get instructions to write it on the tables of our heart so we can take and run with it so when others see it they can want to run with you now if you save their soul you're a partaker with them it's no longer you saying me now you're saying i'm a partaker of this one i'm a partaker of this one and you share that crown together somebody shared the gospel with me somebody is sharing that with me we have a chance to share this crown to be a partaker not just one not just two not just our our favorite friends or our family become all things to all men that you may win some you're only going to get some but it's worth giving your all give your all throughout eternity this thing is going to corrupt i shouldn't say that about something that don't belong to me but [Music] all mine corrupted they're gone probably been sandwiched in some sort of garbage thing but a soul can never crush can never diminish every time you see that person in heaven you're connected you're a partaker with them they wouldn't be there without you so run that you may obtain that soul run so you can obtain that soul don't waste your time down here run with it run with it run with what god gives you because he what he has in mind is another soul don't be so selfish that the only thing he's caring about is you amen that ain't the god that saved me amen the god that saved me was not selfish in fact when he saved me i thought i've got to be the least of all paul he said he was the least and he became a servant of all praise the lord let's stand together so many things i'd like to say right now but i just want to say keep running run with whatever god gives you write it on the table of your heart and run with it let people see a difference in your life keep running keep your eyes on jesus no matter what he says when he comes when you come to church no matter what he says just run with it the moment that you begin to say there's some here that are not running the race with all their heart we're taking some things and leaving others we've lost our vision for souls we want to get that back but it's personal between you
