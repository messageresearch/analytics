everyone that's on the live stream god bless you today we certainly would love for you to be here but we totally understand and just pray that god's spirit would be with you amen let's look to the lord in prayer and just ask his blessings now heavenly father we thank you for the worship that we could come and just worship you from the dictates of our heart to express her our love and song and course and to raise our hands our voices and our heart to you and to tell you how much we love you we thank you for calvary and what you've done for our lives and for the keeping power of the holy spirit and the desire that we have today in our heart to serve you to the end and father we pray that you'd come in a very special way right now in the ministry of the word lord into every home pray that your presence could be felt by every believer but each one that's watching lord lord may they be able to come in unity with you and your word and come in agreement and that your faith would be built and lord the things that are in their heart that you just answer their prayers lord for we are a needy people but you're a god that's able to do exceedingly above all that we would ask of you all that we could even think lord we pray that you come in the revealing of the word today lord that you reveal yourself to us manifest yourself in us that we might become more of a written epistle to the world it is lost it is dying it's on its way out and lord there's still a few souls left to redeem and we pray that you'd use us to find them use us to pray for them use us to reach out to them lord make us the vessels the lord that you can use we commit the service now to you for your honor and glory we humbly pray these things in jesus christ's name amen amen well um i was continuing on our series um with walking with our walk with the lord um and had been studying and tuesday morning about 3 30 quarter to four i was waking up and i never want to get waking that early because i i get up early anyways uh about 4 30 or 5. and uh of course with the time change then getting up at you know quarter to 3 30 quarter to four um it's really what 2 30 quarter to three so i laid there and i tossed and i turned and finally i said okay that's not working i'm just gonna read so i read i started to read and things began to open up and i thought certainly this is not the direction the lord wants me to go so then i got down on my knees and i began to pray and then it it just began to open up and i says okay lord your will so um it's kind of been a quick study because it's only been since tuesday so i came home from work early and i'm studying some more and as i'm laying there studying they kept coming to me asked brother mark to lead the men's meeting they came to me a few times and i didn't yield to it and then we came downstairs and brother mark rosario came over today to do some work and he was there just for a minute and trans communicating with the family and then then he left and so i get in the car and i'm driving down the road and and it came to me again call brother mark and ask him to lead the men's again it wasn't uh for any reason it was just there so i just said okay and i called brother mark and i said brother mark how do you feel about leading the men's meeting he says it'd be be honored to be happy to do that i'll do that and so he's leading the the he starts the men's meeting and he he says okay for opening scripture i want to turn to first john chapter 4 verses 1 through 4. well i had already handed a piece of paper to ann before this time with our opening scripture first john chapter four verses one through four so i'm just gonna say the lord is in this through and through and i don't have nothing to do with it but the lord does the lord does so i'll turn with me if you would to first john chapter 4 and i just i i didn't want to say anything brothers during it i just sat there in awe just wondering what the lord would do starting with verse one beloved believe not every spirit but try the spirits whether they are of god because many false prophets are gone out into the world hereby know ye the spirit of god every spirit that confesseth that jesus christ has come in the flesh is of god and every spirit that confesseth not that jesus christ has come in the flesh is not of god and this is the spirit of antichrist where you have heard that it should come and even now already is it in the world and now already is in the world ye are of god little children and have overcome them because greater is he that is in you than he that is in the world amen god bless you you may be seated well happy st patrick's day to those that celebrate st patrick's day i know our sister kathleen does and usually when it comes to saint patrick's day i think of her and i think i got to wear green and so i wish her sister could be with us i know that she would desire to be uh ann told me earlier today she had read uh or heard that if you're going to believe anything if you're going to believe everything that you read then you should just read the bible i thought well that makes sense because on google you have that tendency of just believing every fact that you look up and if you're going to believe everything that you hear then we should just start listening to the prophet more amen i like to entitle this don't believe everything you hear don't believe everything you hear and for a subject test your thoughts because your opinion could be wrong that's right amen and so as we read our opening scripture here believe not every spirit but try the spirits whether they are of god now i want to say this it would be nice if every one of us have things going on in our life and we really want god to move in them and we don't all have the same thing going on because we're not all but they are things and we want god to tailor as it were a word for us on those things we always do but i'll say this and i believe this with all my heart god has never left leading and guiding us with the message from this pulpit on my heart i believe that god has always sent a word to direct us because if he didn't that he would be a liar and god does not lie the thing is it doesn't usually come the way that we would like it to come but i do believe that god is in his word i do believe he's in the ministry way beyond us way beyond our understanding way beyond he's the one building the church and he loves you more than any human being can love you and he is directing us through the word and i believe that's where we can find him for the directions for our life beloved believe not every spirit but try the spirit try the spirits whether they are of god because many false prophets are gone into the world that word try means test or examine amen and a lot of times thoughts just come into our head and we never take time to test them we're so used to just oh this is right and come to find out a lot of times they're not right amen and i mean we backslide 100 times a day how does that happen the devil tricks us the spirit the way that we test or examine the thoughts that come into our our mind is give it the brother taught us the word test it's got to agree with the word not just part of it but from cover to cover because usually we can find something to agree with it but it's not going to match everything just like you think on these things if it's true well the devil always wants to tell us a little truth but then he throws in the other stuff and it's not a it's not a good report all of a sudden we're thinking things that are not a good report right and that that's how it happens and we need to to give it the word test and the bible says that every spirit that confesseth that jesus christ has come in the flesh is of god and of course we know that the corporate body jesus has been here in the flesh we cannot deny that but even the devils believe that at that time they said are you you come to torment us at this time we know that thou art the son of god so this really is referring to um every spirit that won't manifest christ in your flesh is an antichrist spirit amen that's why we have to try the spirit that word confess means to give in to or to yield to to give into or to yield to it means to you've entered a covenant a compliance or an agreement with so every spirit that comes to you that hasn't given into christ yielded to christ entered into covenant with christ it isn't compliant to the word is it in agreement with the word is antichrist amen now the bible says the devils believe and tremble why do they tremble they tremble because they have not entered into that covenant they haven't submitted to they don't agree with they're not compliance with christ and that's why they're scared they don't want to manifest christ they're not loved with christ and perfect love would cast out the fear that they're having but they tremble they don't want to be subject to christ they don't want to suffer for christ they don't want to love like christ they don't want to submit to christ but they believe the only thing they want to say is i believe they don't want to give in they don't want to yield to the word demonic spirits don't want to be subject to christ nor to the law of christ or the word of god for an example we know that christ came not to do away with the law but to fulfill the law in galatians chapter 5 verse 14 says for all the law is fulfilled in one word even this that thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself so demonic spirits don't want to love they don't want to serve they just want to say they believe all right so the verse right before verse 13 says for brethren you have been called unto liberty only use not your liberty for an occasion to the flesh but by love serve one another and a lot of times our flesh wants to take liberty for itself and those are demonic spirits amen false prophets that word false prophets religious uh imposter that's what that is demonic spirits speak to us all the time in various ways most assuredly we'll hear from the devil when we get down to pray the brother man said the weak as christian when he gets down on his knees makes the demons tremble that's right amen they know they're in trouble if god gets calmed down on the scene amen in that prayer time oh here comes the name of jesus right now what's going to happen to us jesus is going to come on the scene and they tremble so what do they do everything they can to stop you from getting in contact with god amen by faith and when you set off to pray it seems like every other thought wants to be preeminent in your mind at that time your mind becomes bombarded with the chores of the day with a load of laundry a honeydew list got an appointment got to go to the store or problems that you have to deal with things that you want to get done distractions of all sorts when you get down to pray why because the devil doesn't want you getting in contact with god because god is the only thing that can destroy the devil the bible says that christ was manifested in the flesh god was manifested first that he might destroy the works of the devil amen and when christ becomes manifested in our flesh it will just break all the bands of satan all the chains of satan amen we need christ in this flesh can you imagine we're going to just do just a little second role play if we could i'm going to make brother mark god so he's sitting on his throne and i'm going to come and i'm going to approach the lord in prayer and god's been just waiting all day to hear from me because i've just been so busy kept putting it off maybe the night before i didn't pray and finally mornings come and i'm going to pray but god is ready he's excited to hear from me that's right and he's his arms are open he's ready to receive me finally i got time for god and god's happy about it and i get down on my knees and i begin to thank him to praise him and start off maybe praying for somebody and after about a sentence my mind begins to wander but i began literally having a conversation with that thought that's in my mind and i guarantee that thought didn't come from god so who am i having a conversation with you understand what's happening amen we've got to try the spirit and how many times i'm supposed to be praying for the sister i'm supposed to be praying about this situation this person's got cancer it's real important and my mind's going over here and we blow it off this is not a big thing the devil speaks to us so often and god is just sitting there and i thought you come to pray to worship to just ask me in my use my name and it's like you start having a conversation with another person and god's just sitting there i thought you're talking to me come on now think about how god feels we think everything god understands god understands yeah god understands but what god wants and he deserves amen he wants us to try the spirit to see whether it's of god because if we start calling it out we can enter into the spirit of prayer and worship enter into everything else you've heard the song shut in with god in a secret place every one of these things that are coming to our mind they're just weapons that the devil uses towards us to keep us from entering into the spirit and using the name of jesus the way we should they're demonic spirits at a time that seems that we're going through it harmless or they're just thoughts but what the devil's doing is trying to institute a confusion in our mind amen he's the author of confusion all these spirits are just trying to cause confusion they don't care if you're thinking about work don't think about what your plans are thinking about what you want to do for the day you don't care he wants the devil wants to get us in some carnal trap to while i just spent my time praying that's good and i'll go on my day spirits that are sent to disrupt your prayer and bring disorder to your mind to to to your life sometimes these weapons can seem like strongholds you ever like want to pray about something and this thing that's bothering you keeps coming to you and just no matter how much you try to get away from it and pray it just all suddenly just keeps coming back to you those are strongholds can't get them off your mind the devil just keeps reminding you of that negative situation and he's trying to build a real case to get you to start imagining things and we've got to take control of our minds take authority that god has given us to because your mind is free more agency you can do what you want to do with it but it is like a muscle if you're used to thinking negative things all the time it's hard to be positive when you want to be we got to cast down imaginations and every high thing that exalteth itself against the knowledge of god and bring it into captivity every thought to the obedience of christ now that's what has to happen when you're in prayer amen because these thoughts are trying to exalt themselves above god above the time that you're spending with god and worship him and giving him the praise that he's he's worthy of you know i have to get something in about st patrick every st patrick's day right this is a prayer of saint patrick this is where we want to get to i think in how we want to pray is just entering in where everything is just out he says i take for my sureties the power of god to guide me the might of god to uphold me the wisdom of god to teach me the eye of god to watch over me the ear of god to hear me the word of god to give me speech the hand of god to protect me the way of god to go before me and the shield of god to shelter me amen christ be with me christ before me christ behind me christ within me christ beneath me christ above me christ at my right and christ at my left christ in my heart of every man who thinks of me christ in my mouth of every man who speaks to me christ in my eye that's christ in every eye that sees me and christ in every ear that hears me i think that's when we get into prayer we should get it get go with all of our heart don't let the devil use his little tricks try that spirit call it out i'm not going to do it just enter into prayer god will honor that now through the course of the day these spirits continue to worm their way into our mind try to take over the control panel maneuver the levers and most of the time we don't even recognize it's happening until you know something bad happens shall we say because they're just thoughts right they're just thought they're harmless but if we could take heed to these scriptures and believe not everything that we hear but try the spirit we would see what's of god and what is not amen no we don't have a lot of examples of demonic spirits talking to people like we have a lot of scriptures that talk about god talking to a lot of people but we don't have a lot of scriptures that talk about demons talking about talking to people but what we do have is a lot of scriptures that show that demons have been talking to people [Laughter] the result of it remember the time that the disciples wanted to call down judgment upon some people and jesus said you don't know what spirit you're of right amen see they were a demonic spirit that got on them that made them think like that and they didn't even recognize it because they were so uh south religious ignition they were just gonna take charge because this is the word but they didn't have the spirit of the word it was out of context it was out of place their thought process was antichrist and they didn't even know it it was the spirit of air let's look at matthew chapter 16 verse 21. matthew 16 verse 21 from that time forth began jesus to show unto his disciples how that he must go unto jerusalem and suffer many things of the elders and the chief priests and scribes and be killed and be raised again the third day so he's shown them many things that's gonna have to suffer that was his whole purpose of communicating here and this was the manifestation of christ in the flesh that's what this was amen and and peter honestly he was believing just the opposite believers don't do this believers don't suffer like this believers don't have to go through this and peter's thought process was antichrist and he didn't even know it now this is the key because he didn't try the spirit and then brother bruce come and he preached about those two that walked to emmaus and jesus called him out and he says oh you you fools and slow to heart to believe all that the prophets have said you've got to try the spirit amen verse 22 then peter took him and began to rebuke him saying be it far from thee lord this shall not be unto thee i'll just say believe not every spirit believe not everything you hear because peter heard that and he believed it so he's spoken he's gonna straighten out he's gonna straighten out the ministry he's gonna he's gonna you know we're not gonna have a ministry in this church that talks about suffering but he turned and he said unto peter get thee behind me satan thou art in offense to me unto me for thou savers not the things that be of god but the things that be of men there it is try the spirit and see if it's of god or if it's of men if it's men it's going to be what's pleasing to you right it's true if it's going to and that's what satan wants to do he wants to savor you like he did eve this is this is good for you peter believed that jesus was the christ the son of the living god but the spirit that was on him would not enter into a covenant of total surrender to christ because when you enter that covenant you submit you're willing to do whatever jesus asked you to do and that's why jesus had to slice that thing call it out right there you're not willing to suffer that that's wrong that's of the devil every spirit that confesseth not that jesus has come in the flesh is not of god i am not going to suffer christ is not in that flesh it's not and this is what i want to say i've never believed in the ministry the one thing that the prophet taught us is churches wanted to stand behind i this is the evidence of the holy ghost the bible doesn't come out and say this is the evidence of the holy ghost so we know it's not tongues we know it's not just putting your name on the book but he always pointed us that our flesh needs to be manifesting the word that's right it's about holding ourselves accountable to living the word amen anybody can say i got the holy ghost because i did this i did that but that means nothing what means everything is that our flesh is manifesting christ amen and satan is always trying to get us to savor things that are pleasing to us that's why it's so hard to say what makes this age the most evil age the most deceptive age is because you got everything at your fingertips that you could want and the holy ghost is always trying to get us to set our affections on things above it's like two different spirits then jesus then said jesus unto his disciples if any man will come after me let him deny himself and take up his cross and follow me for whosoever say shall save uh whosoever shall save i'm sorry for whosoever will save his life shall lose it and whosoever will lose his life for my sake shall find it and i think it was in the book of mark he also said for the gospel's sake as well for what is a man profited if he shall gain the whole world lose his soul or what shall he a man give in exchange for his soul so before we can before he came to christ we we were totally into ourselves we didn't know about surrendering anything except if we yet obey mom and dad if you didn't you get grounded you don't obey the the the laws of the land you go to jail that's about all we we really knew but after we entered into the covenant with christ satan is still trying to get us to get interested in ourselves to savor the things that are pleasing to our flesh and in this last age he has convinced the church world now to become lovers of their own self more than lovers of god amen it's like they've entered a covenant with themselves so we're living in in perilous times it could be like a newspaper the perilous times and we hear about it all the time but after paul or after jesus gets done rebuking peter and and pretty much calls uh peter who he just gave the keys to and that satan was using his vessel using his vessel calling it out he says i'm not the only one that's going to suffer if you're going to really follow me if you're going to be my disciple you're going to have to do the same thing these are the thoughts of god and satan has always come to us with thoughts that you don't have to surrender everything to god as long as you're in the message as long as you say you believe just don't enter that covenant of total surrender amen god has called us to separate amen to try the spirit separate from the spirit that's trying to get you to please yourself and he's calling us to please him and to serve him amen jesus was not trying to make peace with the spirit that was on peter jesus didn't play around with that spirit he used his sword peter don't believe everything you hear you could be wrong with your thought amen test your thought your opinion might be wrong matthew chapter 10 verse 34 think not that i come to send peace on the earth i came not to send peace but a sword for i have come to set a variance against his father and his daughter against her mother and the daughter in law against her mother-in-law and a man's foe shall be of his own household and he that loveth father or mother more than me is not worthy of me and he that loveth son or daughter more than me is not worthy of me and he that taketh not up his cross and followeth me it's not worthy of me so he's bringing a separation this covenant is between me and you right amen you don't put anything between this covenant now this is important because when we're getting these thoughts on a regular basis did that brother mark saying or amends me that our thoughts speak louder in heaven to god and his mind than our our words do down here our thoughts are important we got to try that spirit because it's trying to seduce us it's trying to get us to lay back amen it cost everything we have to enter in the covenant with god amen and it will continue to cost us everything if we're ever going to manifest christ we are not able to enter that covenant if we love anyone including our own will more than god amen in other words christ will not manifest in our lives if we refuse to pick up our cross as much as we want in our life if we don't pick up our cross we're not going to manifest christ the things that we we see that's so beautiful about christ is that he died for us he suffered for us that that i could be free that's the greatest thing for god so loved the world that he gave and the thoughts that come into our head from the devil but the antichrist doesn't want us to manifest that spirit of laying down our life of serving of giving of reaching out to lost souls it wants us to just be just this message believer that that knows everything and that's all that matters brother mark read a scripture in the bible during our men's means that knowledge puffed up right but love edify it that's right amen and and love the love of christ can only be seen in us if we're dead otherwise you're seeing our love now in luke chapter 14 jesus makes it clear three times that we cannot enter a covenant of discipleship without a full surrender to him this is how important this is and in verses 26 27 and 31 but i would like to start with just reading luke chapter 14 verse 26 if any man will come after me and hate not his father mother wife children brother sister jay and his own life also he cannot be my disciple amen and whosoever does not bear his cross and come after me cannot be my disciple no covenant there now here jesus trying to explain what happens if you start off with the lord you start i'm going to make this come and i'm going to get baptized i'm going to i'm going to say i surrender to you lord but you do not continue to build verse 28 for which if you intend to build a tower sitteth not down first and counter the cost whether it have sufficient to finish it lest happily after ye have laid the foundation and not able to finish it all that behold it began to mock him saying this man began to build and was not able to finish so what is the cost the cost is are you are you going to give all that you have your heart rate that's the cost because many people are willing to get baptized they're willing to say i repent of my past i'm going to get baptized and i'm saved that's starting that's starting your building but what are you really building you're building christ the name of the lord is a high tower amen and you've got to finish that tower amen you got to come to statue of a perfect man you can't stay there in the foundation got to continue to build amen amen amen verse 31 and hear jesus explaining the same thing in a third way first he just come out and said it then he gives this little uh uh like picturette thing with with a tower and and now he's talking about an army but he's really saying the same thing the exact same thing but another way for us to catch it or what king going to make war against another king sith not down first and consulteth whether he be able with ten thousand to meet him that cometh against him with twenty thousand or else while the other is yet a great way off he sendeth an embassage and desire the conditions of peace so likewise whosoever you he be of you that forsaketh not all that he have that's right he cannot be disciple so why is this so important why is why is jesus talking about this the devil knows that if you surrender everything he has no no he's helpless with you he can't do nothing with you that's true but if you just hold on to your will you hang on to what's pleasing to your flesh well he's got a crack in the door and that's why it's important that you understand that these thoughts that are coming into you are going to lean one way or the other amen we can't fight against god either will surrender to his will or we can't enter in that covenant of a discipleship amen now we maybe don't know that right off the bat when we come to christ right but after a while we grow and we learn many things i like to say to you but you can't bear it now but after the holy ghost comes right we got to go on to perfection that's what the bible says jesus expresses his view for the person who loses their taste for the things of god in other words for the person who stops building amen the person who starts and then stops verse 34 salt is good but if the salt have lost his savor wherewith shall it be seasoned it is neither fit for the land nor yet for the dunghill but men cast it out and he that have ears let him hear if you lose your savior if you lose i surrender all i surrender to you lord that's right if you lose that that's right god can't use you amen so get behind me satan thou art offense for thou savers not the things that be of god and here jesus is saying look i'm going to go to jerusalem i'm going to be suffering all these things i'm doing it for a purpose that souls could be saved amen well we've got to do the same thing we got to surrender so souls can be saved now that's the things that are savoring to god right but if our life loses its salt it loses his savor and we just become pictures on the wall of people in a pew not a living epistle not going out there and winning souls we let the the the the news that are around us consume our mind our thoughts and all of a sudden we become conformed to the way that they're thinking and we we we miss out we got to try the spirit now when the tower is finished being built we would consider that complete in other words we finally reached our initial intention when we started to serve christ is that right and for the believer that would be the image of christ coming into the complete image of christ and that would be a perfect love a perfect word a perfect love it's the same thing i'm not mean to two different things god so the word he so loved the world that he gave and every spirit that doesn't confess that jesus christ has come in the flesh as antichrist so i want you to think about this perfection matthew chapter 5 verse 48 be ye therefore perfect even as your father which is in heaven is perfect so this is where we got to get to that image what we initially started out for jesus describes the perfection of our father that's in heaven as one that loves your enemy bless them that curse you do good to them that hate you pray for them that despitefully use you and persecute you now that's where we need to be in our heart amen in our spirit in our mind this is what we need to manifest be a real reality that ye may be the children of your father which is in heaven for he maketh the sun to rise on the evil and on the good and he saith reign on the just and the unjust and there is no reward to love somebody but not everybody that's loving with respect to persons and don't even the publicans do that amen so don't believe everything that you hear it's okay not to love this person it's okay not to pray it's okay not don't let this person use you really don't let that person use you what sounds right don't believe everything you hear how are you about to pray for somebody if you don't let them use you you're supposed to pray for those that tell me if you don't let that person use you somebody will and the closer you get to god the more people use you that's true the more you lay down your life amen they use the prophet left and right money the gifts the the bring more people to church they use them a lot but you know when somebody uses you you can just pray for it fulfill the scripture now you can do something that's perfection that's what i love about let's get back to first john chapter 4. beloved believe not every spirit but try the spirits try the spirits whether they are of god because many of the spirits that come to our mind many of the thoughts that come to our mind they're of the world amen hereby know ye the spirit of god every spirit that confesseth that jesus christ is come in the flesh is of god and every spirit that confesseth that jesus christ confesses not that jesus christ is come in your flesh is out of god and this is the spirit of antichrist where you have heard that it should come and even now already is it in the world that's right now you're of god little children and you have overcome them now these are spirits now these are not a bunch of people walk around saying i'm a prophet because we don't have many of them don't how many people know those prophets run around these are spirits these are thoughts that come into your mind amen but the bible says you've overcome them because you have something greater inside of you you have the holy ghost inside of you and you're able to try the spirit by the holy ghost the holy ghost won't let you just sit there and spend all day thinking on negative things amen i know that's going to hurt but it's the truth because there's a god that's greater than the devil that lives inside you and you've got to yield to that amen and he says here in verse 5 they are of the world therefore they speak of the world and the world hear them and that's the same thing peter was doing no no we're not going to hurt ourselves that's of the world they they speak of themselves and the world heareth them we are of god and he that knoweth god heareth us and he that is not of god hearth not us hereby know he the spirit truth and the spirit of air they are of the world therefore they speak of the world so everything the devil is talking to you is about your flesh that is the world amen it's your nature it's your carnality it's everything that your your flesh is into you know we used to do this thing um where it was to help people not think negative because some people just have negative thoughts so much and i told a couple people i said you just take a rubber band put on your wrist and you just every time you get you you you finally realize that you got negative thought you take and you pop that rubber band on your wrist and just kind of give yourself a little spanking on your wrist boom now and you know a couple of times it's not a big deal but after a while it begins to hurt and then you realize how many times you have negative thoughts that you don't think you're having them and it's the same way when you have selfish thoughts thoughts about yourself thoughts of the world we're in the world amen but we're not of the world and it's up to us god's not going to try the spirit for us we got to be the one to try the spirit we got to be the one to take the time to think about what's going on in our brain beloved let us not let us love one another right now we're just here we are we're he's he's trying to separate now the two spirits again the spirit of the world the spirit of god believe not every spirit let us not let us love one another for love is of god and everyone that is that everyone that loveth is born of god and knoweth god he that loveth not he really doesn't know god that's true for god is love that's right here it is in this was manifested manifested the flesh it is confessing it and this was manifested the love of god toward us because god sent his only begotten son into the world that we might live through him here in his love not that we love god but that he loved his first and he sent his son to be the appreciation of our sin beloved if god so loved us we ought to love one another he's showing us what our flesh should be manifesting not saying i believe but our our flesh should be manifesting the love of god amen turn with me to saint john chapter 8 verse 39 we're going to come back to this saint john chapter 8 verse 39 they answered and said unto him abraham is our father and jesus saith unto them if ye were abraham's children your flesh would manifest it that's right you would do the works of abraham amen it would be manifested inside of them what did abraham do he surrendered his will to god he gave up everything amen he loved god so much and he became obedient to the complete word of god he kept surrendering kept surrendering he refused to love his family lot more than god he separated from his own family mother father sister brother just like we read yet he never lost his burden to intercede for lot he manifested his love towards lot in many different ways he loved lot as himself so he says if you were abraham's children you would do the works of abraham in other words these religious people who said they believed in god did not manifest the love of god right verse 40 but now you seek to kill me a man that have told you the truth which i have heard of god this did not abraham amen jesus was looking at the manifestation of their flesh and when you see somebody seeking to kill somebody's influence this did not abraham do right this is not the works of abraham it's a wrong spirit amen it's an antichrist spirit when you're seeking to kill someone's influence it's a wrong spirit it's an antichrist spirit this did not abraham and we're the children of abraham if anything he should be interceding like lot did are you going to destroy the whole city for for uh when there's 50 when there's 40 when there's 30 when there's 20 when there's 10 my nephew's down there he didn't kill his influence oh well he should have pitched his tent towards the world i'm we're talking about trying the spirits we're trying to become more spiritual amen that's what this is about verse 41 jesus said you do the deeds of your father and they said then said they to him we be not born of fornication like you are starting this little drama fight we have one father even god the antichrist spirit actually got them to believe without it being manifested in the flesh they were they were believers in god but they did not try the spirit to love the lord they got with all the heart with all their soul with all their might to love thy neighbor as thyself they didn't want they didn't try the spirit they didn't need you because they were so much religious believed amen i don't need to try the spirit i know i'm right verse 42 jesus said unto them if god were your father you would love me wow didn't that we just read that in saint john if you're born again you love amen if you really really know god if god is your father i don't care how bad you think i am you would love me for i proceeded forth i proceeded fourth and came from god neither came i myself but he sent me and if you want to know if god is your father love jesus and love one another amen then you know there's no other scripture there's no other scripture by this shall all men know that you are his disciples that you're into this covenant with him that you're sold out is when you can love your enemy because anybody can stand for part of the word at any given time but not the whole word if you're standing for the whole word the whole law is fulfilled in this one word that you love one another right that you love your neighbor as you love god you you love your neighbors yourself that's the fulfillment that's the perfection now if you love with the human love that doesn't go all the way to there then you're picking and choosing who you're gonna love when you're going to love and not really pray for them with your uh a heart that's full of compassion and you can't say that is the manifestation of the love of god that's the christ because you're leaving out part of the word right you see what i'm saying here verse 43 43 why do you not understand my speech even because you cannot hear my word amen hear of your father the devil and the lust of your father you will do he was a murderer from the beginning and abode not the truth because there's no truth in him when he speaketh a lie he speaketh of look it of his own for he's a liar and the father of it he speaks of his own it's all about pleasing self amen the lust of lucifer was to do his own will he taught it to the angels to do the same thing you just have whatever you want he taught to eve he teaches us to do the same thing and if he doesn't get what he wants what does he do he murders jesus said he was a murderer from the beginning how many souls has satan murdered how many souls is satan sending to hell by telling them a lie oh you're not gonna you're not gonna die you're gonna be just like god you'll be fine he's a murderer was this not the same spirit that was manifested in cain who murdered his brother when he didn't get what he wanted amen is this not the same spirit that is manifested inside of us when we're killing somebody's influence because we're not getting the attention we want right amen now i'm just speaking the truth now amen just because we don't take it that far doesn't mean it's still not the same spirit amen so we we don't want to believe everything that we hear the devil is trying to catch us the spirit of anarchists will try to get us to dominate one another dominating a home buy them the head anyways dominate work dominating the church dominate amen eventually will begin to bite and devour one another to prove who's the who's better better than the other person amen the spirit of christ will try to get us to serve and love one another amen but the flesh really isn't interested in esteeming the others better than ourselves so don't believe every spirit and don't believe a spirit that's trying to get you to dominate don't believe everything you hear because it's not of god you should know the spirit of the holy ghost even the bible says when there's you know the prophet the spirit of the prophets is subject to the prophets there's a there's a there's not only an order but there's a submission there it's so beautiful the spirit of christ is so perfect and so beautiful amen it's we who begin to mix things up and and take things into our control and we lose the real spirit of christ manifest in the flesh mark chapter 10 verse 35 and james and john the sons of zebedee come unto him saying master we would that thou should do for us we would that thou should just do for us whatsoever we shall desire isn't it like us this is what i want lord and he said unto them what would you have that i should do for you and they said unto him grant us that we may sit one on the right hand the other on the left hand like glory and jesus said to them you know not what you ask i wonder how many times we've asked for something that we don't know what we're asking for can you drink the cup that i drink of course we know this is talking about suffering right amen and be baptized with the baptism that i am baptized with that's why they didn't know what they were asking they thought it was just gonna be easy to get there and they said unto him we can and jesus said unto them ye shall indeed drink of the cup you're gonna drink of it that i drink of and the batches i'm baptized with what shall you be baptized but to sit on my right hand and on my left hand is not given it's not mine to give but it shall be given to them to whom is prepared amen and when the ten heard it they began to be much displeased with james and john because now they thought they were special they received this thought that was as much uh antichrist as the thought of we're not going to suffer is the same same thing this spirit began to spread in the church and the other ten were so now they were just a little displeased they were they got on the phone and they began to talk about somebody in the church oh yeah we won't mention any names but they just everybody just started talking about us james and john they they thought they think they're special they're better than us and we're we're we're walking the same roads we're doing the same things that jesus asked and and it it's just not fair and they they begin to develop they began to believe every thought that was coming into their head they didn't stop and say this isn't right they just they just yielded to it and jesus called to them i love this mercy and grace jesus called to them and saith unto them you know that they which are are accounted to rule over the gentiles they exercise this type of spirit and their great ones exercise authority upon them but so shall it not be among you we're just not going to do that in our church but whosoever wants to be the greatest among you just let him minister now that doesn't mean the pulpit here just want to make that clear to me clean the church is important very important you can minister in a lot of different ways but anytime that you've got some sort of popularity or something that's attached to it man it's dangerous it'd be better to serve and get nothing out of it that's true service amen and that's what jesus is telling us here whosoever you that be the chiefest shall be the servant of just a few people that you talk to now and then hear it this way that no all servant of all and whoever talked to you oh i'm servant i'm a servant what do you want i want to serve you how can i serve you for even the son of man came not to be ministered unto you know what you owe me i've done this for you but to minister and to give his life a ransom for many amen so jesus is telling the disciples this is the example i've laid for you this is what i'm doing i didn't come i'm the i'm the i'm the one that created everything and i didn't even come to get served but you want to be my disciple you want to serve me and this is how you do it you lay down your life like i did now these is how you try the spirit because there's a motive behind the spirit that comes into your mind we're talking about trying the spirit christ in the flesh will manifest as a servant for many not as one who's always manifesting that they want to dominate now i've seen this that some spirits can play it both ways they can sometimes be a servant and sometimes dominate now look when you're in charge you have to take charge but god has not called us to dominate sometimes and then sometimes to serve it's not if you can play the servant it's if you can live a servant right amen if you can live it out on a regular basis christ in the flesh will manifest as a servant to all as someone who loves all without respect to persons love them enough to serve them don't love them enough to say god bless you go on your way love them enough to serve them so don't believe everything you hear let's try to wrap this up how we doing on time let's just read it real quick then real real quick we left off let's start with with verse number 11 beloved if god so loved us we all also to love one another no man have seen god at any time if we love one another god dwelleth in us and his love is perfected in us hereby know we that we dwell in him and he and us because he have given us his spirit so his spirit inside of us is just manifesting that love manifesting the word and and we have seen and do testify that the father sent the son to be the savior of the world and whosoever will confess that whoever will confess that that jesus is the son of god god dwelleth in him and he in the world so how's the world gonna know he said by this shall all men know this is this manifestation now because we've got to try the spirit if you look at this whole book of john it's about love and we have known and believe the love of the love that god have to us god is love and he that dwelleth in love dwelting god and god in him and herein is our love made perfect that we may have boldness in the day of judgment because as he is so are we in this world how is he loves his enemy rain falls on the just and the unjust prays for them that despitefully use them that's where jesus told us perfect love is and we can have that in this world right now we can manifest that right now amen and when if we do manifest perfect love right now in this world we can have boldness on the day of judgment because as he is so are we in this world it's so beautiful there is no fear you can go and approach the the with boldness on the day of judgment there will be no fear why because the perfect love that's inside of you that you've been manifesting it cast out all fear amen because fear have torment and he that feareth is not made perfect in love we love him because he first loved us if any man say i love god and hate his brother he is a liar for he that loveth not his brother whom he have not seen how can he love god who he has not seen and this commandment have we from him that he who loveth god love his brother also did not we read here that no man is seeing god at any time no man has seen god any time but if christ is living in you and loving through you they see god in you they see god in the flesh again that's god's desire it's his yearning amen we've got to try the spirits make sure that we're just not letting anything float in our mind and giving it you know okay or free reign we'll never manifest the love of god well we gotta slice it right here if not it'll become our thoughts and it'll become our words and our actions and before you know it would develop this attitude that's antichrist and don't even realize what happened amen amen let's stand together god bless you god bless you god give you a great desire to try the spirits this this may have not been shall we say a message that is like wow so perfectly flowery spoken and makes you feel good they never are at least for me um but i believe god's been in the heart of this message to the church we by us trying the spirit we are getting our thoughts in order and when our thoughts are in order we will better love one another when we're texting somebody when we're when we're talking on the phone when we're when we're and the worst thing you want to do is is talk to somebody face to face but inside your heart you feel different than the words that you're saying it's not the love of god amen and i tell you you can't just turn light switch on and manifest christ it takes a lot of dying out a lot of giving a surrendering and and as you're going to do that thoughts are going to come to your head and you do you got to learn to try the spirits test your thoughts before you continue thinking on them you could be wrong your opinion could be wrong about what you're thinking give it the word test quick if it's building yourself up if it's cutting somebody down get rid of it real quick i mean start you know write down a a list when you go home sometime write a list of how you can quickly check a thought with the word instead of just everything like oh i think is okay that's it's we'll never grow in that department then amen amen let's bow in prayer heavenly father we come to you lord with just as sincere hearts as we know we're so unworthy of you so unworthy of your grace of your mercy all the times lord that our thoughts have just gone off in a way that ended up not being righteous and holy and pure and and good sound thoughts from heaven above lord because we so full pride that we didn't want to try the spirit that we could be wrong lord we're asking today lord the very purpose in which you sent this message to us today that you would you would grant the fulfillment of it that we would begin to exercise these scriptures more and that we take more account and more thought into the things that we think to consider that maybe the things that we're thinking aren't from you the enemy is has slipped in there they could be as simple as thoughts that would try to down downgrade us make us feel uh it causes us to feel that you don't care about us you don't love us when you couldn't love us anymore never changed your mind and your opinion about us you you have an expected end for us but lord our flesh is so full of emotions and feelings and ups and downs and god we need you we need you we pray lord as we we practice trying the spirit god help us hold our hand open our eyes help us to see how we can do this lord that our thoughts may be more pleasing to you amen our words and our actions can be more pleasing to you bless and strengthen each one of us lord god in this hour where lord the the all the news that we hear from other people from the radio from the tv from the news from our phones wherever it is seems like such bad news god i pray that you help us to have a strong clear clean mind sober on the things that are are pleasing to you bless every
