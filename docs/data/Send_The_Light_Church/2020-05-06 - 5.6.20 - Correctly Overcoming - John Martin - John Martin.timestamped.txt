[27:12] of our turning up our our noses that
[27:16] love such love where would we be today
[27:18] without the love of God amen amen we're
[27:23] just gonna read one verse here in the
[27:26] book of Romans chapter 12 and it's going
[27:32] to be the very last verse verse number
[27:34] 21 amen and the Bible reads be not
[27:41] overcome of evil but overcome evil with
[27:47] good I just want to read that one more
[27:51] time be not overcome of evil but
[27:56] overcome evil with good amen if you
[28:02] would just bow your heart with me in a
[28:04] word of Prayer father we thank you for
[28:07] your Eternal Word and God as we look
[28:11] upon this it's a scripture that we all
[28:15] face daily because we face evil daily
[28:18] and we want to overcome it and Lord we
[28:22] struggle so many times
[28:24] God you've given us your word here to
[28:30] overcome it with good lord I pray as we
[28:35] look into your scriptures here more
[28:39] scriptures and we take this little
[28:43] thought of overcoming the correct way
[28:47] father I pray that you would open our
[28:51] hearts understanding and you'd be
[28:54] gracious to give us revelation of your
[28:57] precious Word make this word come off
[29:01] the pages of your dear book to become a
[29:05] living life inside of us Lord through
[29:09] the power of the Holy Ghost bless each
[29:12] one Lord that we might be overcomers
[29:17] better overcomers Lord we pray thank you
[29:21] for these things now Lord we ask in
[29:23] Jesus Christ's name Amen amen god bless
[29:26] you may be seated
[29:27] well we want to entitle this message
[29:32] correctly overcoming and for a subject
[29:38] overcoming evil and the reason I want
[29:44] entitle it correctly overcoming is a lot
[29:47] of times when we're dealing with
[29:48] problems whether we're dealing with
[29:51] whatever the problem might be weird
[29:55] looking so much for an answer that a lot
[30:01] of times we just wanted do whatever we
[30:05] got to do to not be dealing with it
[30:08] anymore and at that point you know do we
[30:12] put that thing on the Shelf do we do we
[30:15] put it under a rug do we ignore it do we
[30:18] make some excuse and I'm just I wonder
[30:24] sometimes if we think we've overcome but
[30:28] really we haven't done it correctly and
[30:32] the Bible shares with us here Paul be
[30:37] not
[30:38] overcomed of evil but overcome evil with
[30:41] good that means you've got to have the
[30:44] goods to overcome amen well the world
[30:48] that we live in is full of evil I just
[30:53] want to say before we start I miss you
[30:55] all I really wish that you were all here
[30:58] you know close and I know I've said that
[31:00] before but I just wanted to share what
[31:03] was on my heart there but the world that
[31:06] we live in is full of evil hatred is on
[31:10] a rampage Cheryl was just telling me
[31:13] yesterday there was somebody that was on
[31:17] a plane just recently and they were
[31:22] going from obviously one state to
[31:24] another state and there was some
[31:26] carrying on and one person just most
[31:31] turned around and asked if they could
[31:33] just keep it down just a little bit and
[31:37] the people were carrying on they just
[31:39] two guys two people got out of their
[31:41] seat and just beat the tar out of that
[31:44] guy who just asked him if they could
[31:46] just you know quiet it down and he was
[31:48] all bloody and they had actually down
[31:51] the plane before they got to their
[31:52] destination and the world that we live
[31:56] in is full of evil hatred is under on a
[32:00] rampage and there's bullying more and
[32:03] more in schools and racism and human
[32:07] abuse and shootings and schools actually
[32:09] in killings and drug abuse terrorism
[32:12] murder in every sector suicide
[32:17] depression cancer diseases and
[32:20] sicknesses and brother Ram taught us
[32:22] that that cancer is just a devil and and
[32:25] so that just evil
[32:27] all around us in this world and there is
[32:31] an inspiration directly from how to take
[32:34] complete control over humanity in order
[32:38] to destroy it there's so much fighting
[32:42] between political party lines
[32:45] there's so much cover-up there half of
[32:49] it has never been told there was a time
[32:51] News used to be news but now when you
[32:54] hear news you don't probably most the
[32:57] time it's it's fake news or just
[32:59] somebody trying to push their agenda and
[33:01] you really really never know any more
[33:05] people lobby for everything including
[33:09] how to give the game more rights how to
[33:14] be accepted in a way that God would
[33:19] never accept it science fiction is
[33:23] increasing more and more through
[33:26] television but I feel the devil has
[33:33] thrown more money into the movie sector
[33:36] about gay and immoral relationships than
[33:46] anything else trying to promote his
[33:49] propaganda in that way more than
[33:52] anything else what better way for him to
[33:56] get his agenda to spread than through
[33:58] through television where people can can
[34:00] see it and absorb it more in and kind of
[34:03] get used to it know that there's there's
[34:05] no show out there that just the whole
[34:07] thing is gay but what they do is they
[34:10] you watch something and then all sudden
[34:13] they just slip a little something in
[34:15] there and you word in a world of this
[34:16] thing come from and that's what the
[34:18] devil is trying to his Trenor
[34:19] he's slipping in and the world is just
[34:21] becoming more and more evil what better
[34:24] way to bring about as it was in the days
[34:27] of of Noah or in the days of lot Sodom
[34:31] and gomorrah's at were in nineteen
[34:34] twenty Berlin developed into the first
[34:38] gay village in the world and he says
[34:42] what Google tells us today they are
[34:46] number nine on the top ten list of
[34:50] contenders of the gay capital of the
[34:53] world Tel Aviv Israel being number two
[34:58] but there's a whole list of cities that
[35:01] are known for being gay friendly now
[35:05] there's probably a lot of people
[35:07] watching this or could be watching this
[35:11] we get people watching this that aren't
[35:13] really a part of the group but youtubers
[35:15] and they may not agree with it but it's
[35:19] the truth anyways the devil has slowly
[35:22] worked his magic of deception to corrupt
[35:26] in society his brought immortality of
[35:29] this great nation to its lowest ebb that
[35:32] has ever been Satan is making the world
[35:35] a wilderness there things are
[35:38] continually getting worse they're not
[35:40] getting better they're getting worse
[35:42] Isaiah chapter 14 verse 12 listen to
[35:46] this how art thou fallen from heaven o
[35:50] Lucifer son of the morning how art thou
[35:54] cut down to the ground which didst
[35:56] weaken the nation's look at that
[35:58] weakened the nation's what is Satan
[36:01] doing now he's weakening the nation's
[36:04] with his immorality and evil that they
[36:10] that see thee shall narrowly look upon
[36:13] thee and consider thee saying this is
[36:16] this the man that made the earth to
[36:20] tremble and it didn't shake the kingdoms
[36:23] well what have we just gone through hate
[36:25] men what are we just gone through here
[36:27] of late and all the nations just
[36:30] trembling in this the stock markets and
[36:33] so much it's just fear saying that
[36:37] society will never get back to what it
[36:39] was before the devil enjoys tormenting
[36:45] people verse 17 that made the world a
[36:50] wilderness and destroyed the cities
[36:54] thereof and open not the house of his
[36:57] prisoners Satan has weakened mortality
[37:02] by giving people by giving people what
[37:08] their flesh wants that's how he weakens
[37:13] the knee that's how he weakens the whole
[37:15] that's how I weakens the family to give
[37:18] them what their flesh
[37:19] months there's absolutely no way to stop
[37:24] the onslaught of evil that's increasing
[37:26] in today's world no way to take control
[37:29] of the world that we're living in
[37:32] there's no way to conquer the
[37:35] corruptness that's so embedded into our
[37:37] government
[37:38] there's no way to subdue the money
[37:40] hungry power thirsty society that we're
[37:44] living him so how do we overcome
[37:47] something that can't be stopped
[37:50] Ezekiel 28 verse 18 it's it's it's
[37:55] crapped into our churches Ezekiel 28 18
[37:59] this evil tells us that Satan has
[38:03] defiled our sanctuaries by a multitude
[38:07] of thine iniquities think about that we
[38:10] just we talked about iniquity health
[38:13] abounding it's actually corrupted and
[38:17] defiled
[38:18] the sanctuaries how do we prevail over
[38:24] something that's corrupting even our
[38:27] churches in the world church leaders
[38:31] have left Christ the word out of the
[38:34] church and have taken over their own
[38:37] south man has taken over the church men
[38:41] have kicked out conviction out of the
[38:44] church and replaced it with
[38:46] entertainment because they enjoy that so
[38:50] much more 2nd Timothy chapter 4 verse 3
[38:56] for the time will come when they will
[39:01] not endure sound doctrine but after
[39:04] their own lusts shall they heap to
[39:07] themselves teachers that will give the
[39:11] people what they want to hear they don't
[39:15] want sound doctrine anymore they their
[39:18] flesh is lusting is desiring something
[39:21] that they want and they shall turn away
[39:27] their ears from the truth and shall be
[39:31] turned
[39:32] to fables what I've learned is most
[39:36] people don't mind hearing the truth
[39:38] about the Gospel as long as they don't
[39:42] have to change but as soon as they
[39:46] requires a change in them well they're
[39:51] not as interested in that type of a
[39:53] gospel they're interested in a truth
[39:56] that that they don't have to change with
[39:59] something that they can agree with but
[40:02] they don't have to change their
[40:03] lifestyle so churchgoers are ever
[40:08] learning and never able to come to the
[40:11] knowledge of the truth Tim Paul said to
[40:14] Timothy men have replaced revelation
[40:18] with the tree of knowledge just
[40:22] knowledge taking its place they replaced
[40:25] the power of God with just a form of
[40:27] godliness and they replaced the Holy
[40:30] Ghost with their own ghost second
[40:35] Timothy chapter 3 verse 13 but evil men
[40:39] and evil and seducers that word seducers
[40:43] means juggling imposters so these are
[40:48] people who are imposter or impersonating
[40:54] Christianity but evil men and seducers
[40:56] shall wax worse and worse deceiving and
[41:00] being deceived it just is it is getting
[41:03] worse the scripture is being fulfilled
[41:06] the whole world and the church world is
[41:09] being deceived but continue thou in the
[41:14] things which thou has learned verse 14
[41:16] and has been assured of knowing of whom
[41:23] thou has learned them so we're here
[41:26] today to continue to continue learning
[41:31] from the Lord continue growing in the
[41:33] Lord we've taken this this time because
[41:38] we want to continue in the truth we live
[41:43] in a a very evil world
[41:46] and how can we overcome this world this
[41:49] evil in this world with good people seem
[41:53] to to trample over us in and use us we
[41:59] can't even stop them most people most
[42:04] and I don't even say all the time but
[42:08] how many people actually don't care
[42:10] about themselves they only care about
[42:13] helping somebody but Jesus told us this
[42:18] what happened this is the kind of world
[42:21] that we're living in but the question is
[42:24] how do we overcome it we can't overcome
[42:29] the evil that's in the world out there
[42:36] but the evil that we can overcome is the
[42:40] evil that's inside of us and it does no
[42:46] good or does very little good if we can
[42:50] convince somebody in the world that
[42:53] they're wrong about some evil that
[42:56] they're doing it's not going to change
[42:59] the whole sector of the world yeah it'll
[43:00] make it could make a difference for that
[43:02] one in that area but the evil that we
[43:10] need to be concerned about is the evil
[43:13] that lies inside of us Romans chapter 12
[43:16] verse 21 our opening Scripture be not
[43:18] overcome of evil but overcome evil with
[43:21] good the evil that we need to overcome
[43:24] is not our society it's not our
[43:26] government it's not terrorism it's not
[43:29] gay organization or abortion clinics the
[43:34] evil that we need overcome attacks our
[43:36] mind it's the evil that often times gets
[43:42] bottled up inside of us to thoughts
[43:45] until it what Rupp's with a carnal
[43:49] nature lashes out Matthew chapter 15
[43:55] verse 18
[43:58] Jesus speaking he says those things
[44:01] which proceed out of the mouth come from
[44:04] the heart and they defile the man
[44:09] so it's from within for out of the heart
[44:12] proceed evil thoughts murders adulteries
[44:16] fornications thefts false witness
[44:19] blasphemies and these are the things
[44:24] which defile man so here we see that
[44:26] evil erupts rape from inside a man did
[44:31] you know the Bible says that our tongue
[44:33] is an unruly member an unruly member is
[44:38] our tongue in its full of deadly poison
[44:41] full of it just ready like - it's almost
[44:45] like a snake that has a venom and it's
[44:49] inside it's full venom but you don't
[44:53] feel it until it bites right until it
[44:56] puts us in and our tongue it can be that
[44:59] way it's it can be there just waiting
[45:04] for the right time to lash out and and
[45:07] say something that it shouldn't say
[45:09] James chapter 3 verse 6 and the tongue
[45:14] is a fire a world of iniquity the tongue
[45:19] is a world of iniquity see it's not just
[45:22] out there it's right here in this little
[45:25] member that defile ahthe the whole body
[45:28] and setteth on fire the course of nature
[45:33] and it is set on fire of hell if you
[45:37] just you know how many times you had a
[45:40] bite your tongue right keep from saying
[45:43] something well look it was already in
[45:48] your mind and did it come from the heart
[45:53] and so this is what we want to zoom in
[45:56] on is the things that we can control and
[45:59] that's the evil that's inside of our of
[46:03] ourselves we can do something about that
[46:06] praise God amen we entertain evil
[46:10] thoughts in a
[46:11] imaginations that eventually become a
[46:14] stronghold in our mind we can become so
[46:18] confused and twisted up by the devil's
[46:21] thoughts that he corrupts our mine way
[46:27] we think in her confusion
[46:29] it all starts as brother man taught us
[46:32] in our mind where the greatest battle
[46:35] ever fought and he says it is still
[46:37] going on today a lot of times we don't
[46:43] want to admit just how evil we can be in
[46:46] our minds in our hearts sometimes of
[46:50] course we want to to to view ourselves
[46:53] as pretty good chaps and we want others
[46:56] to to view us as as is good and then I
[47:00] believe those are they're both good
[47:02] desires but the fact of the matter is we
[47:06] deal with a very evil nature that is
[47:09] selfish self-centered and if I can say
[47:12] it like this self right it's just right
[47:15] it views itself is being right whether
[47:17] it's self righteous or not it's a self
[47:19] right that evil nature is always seeking
[47:24] its own will now this is the big evil
[47:27] it's not all that stuff out there all
[47:30] that stuff out there is because of
[47:32] something that started inside here that
[47:35] evil nature Romans chapter eight verse
[47:40] seven says because the carnal mind is
[47:43] enmity against God that's this mind the
[47:47] carnality of the way that it thinks is
[47:51] against God for it is not subject to the
[47:55] law of God neither indeed can it be sort
[47:58] of go ahead and try to if I could say
[48:02] discipline the mind you know it's just
[48:07] gonna pop up some some other way with
[48:09] another thought it just it has to be
[48:12] crucified because we need the mind of
[48:16] Christ amen
[48:17] James chapter four verse one just kind
[48:21] of laying a foundation and you know how
[48:23] I am with my foundations
[48:25] chapter 4 verse 1 from whence come Wars
[48:28] and Fighting's among you come they not
[48:31] hence even of your lusts that war in
[48:35] your members and we're talking about
[48:36] evil right they come in from inside of
[48:42] our members they're inside of us yeah
[48:44] that person they swore at us they got
[48:47] mad at us they cut us off they didn't
[48:49] give us the right food at the restaurant
[48:51] they didn't do what they said they were
[48:53] going to do they they yelled at us it's
[48:55] true that you can point a finger at some
[48:59] wrong that was done out there but if you
[49:02] yield to your flesh it's gonna wore off
[49:06] there's gonna be that war and it's gonna
[49:07] lash out and straighten that situation
[49:10] out and you're really not overcoming any
[49:13] evil with good you're trying to overcome
[49:16] the evil situation that you're in with
[49:20] an evil nature and you're you're you're
[49:25] not you're you're you're not overcoming
[49:28] evil with good you're overcoming evil
[49:31] with you're an evil nature and it's
[49:32] that's what the whole world is trying to
[49:34] do is try to outdo one another I'll tell
[49:36] one another out with one another trying
[49:39] to be bigger than one another executing
[49:43] who's the greatest who's the best who's
[49:46] who's always right or who's more right
[49:50] first fine do you think that the
[49:54] scripture saith in vain the spirit that
[49:59] dwelleth in us lusteth to envy no it's
[50:05] it's not vain but we have a tendency of
[50:07] forgetting we have a tendency of
[50:10] forgetting kind of the nature that needs
[50:17] to be crucified every day or it can get
[50:20] out of hand now if you're an alcoholic
[50:25] they say that half of the battle is
[50:29] admitting that you're an alcoholic is to
[50:32] get somebody to admit that they have a
[50:35] problem that they have this problem
[50:37] because most of time it's in - now oh
[50:38] yeah I drink oh yeah I got the drink but
[50:42] just to call me an alcoholic no no no
[50:46] not that far and so a person who doesn't
[50:49] admit they have this severe problem is
[50:53] never going to look for help so why do
[50:55] they say that half the problem is
[50:57] admitting that you are what you are is
[51:00] because at that time you can begin to
[51:03] look for help to look for an answer to
[51:05] help you with your situation because
[51:07] you've admitted it now you're not no
[51:09] longer trying to to to downplay I think
[51:15] a lot of times we forget how needy we
[51:19] really are our condition Ecclesiastes
[51:24] chapter 5 verse 1 praise the Lord
[51:32] keep thy foot when thou goes to the
[51:37] house of God and be more ready to hear
[51:41] than to give the sacrifice of fools for
[51:45] they consider not that they do evil now
[51:47] the point I wanted to bring here is that
[51:50] you know we're supposed to go to the
[51:52] house of God we're supposed to praise
[51:54] the Lord we're supposed to offer the
[51:58] sacrifice of praise to the Lord but
[52:02] there is a way that we need to approach
[52:05] God
[52:06] a humble contrite like I know I need you
[52:09] Lord
[52:10] and sometimes we can forget that we do
[52:14] evil and at that point we're not we
[52:19] we're not we don't got half the battle
[52:21] won yet if I could say it like that
[52:23] we're still we still need to be
[52:26] convinced that we need to hear this word
[52:29] that we need to hear what God's trying
[52:30] to present to us instead of well you
[52:34] know I don't agree with that I I know I
[52:35] don't see that I'm okay why you saying
[52:38] that I'm not a sinner and of course
[52:40] you're not a sinner you're a saint
[52:43] you're you're you're saved by God's
[52:45] grace but if you have any sore
[52:51] of understanding about coming to the
[52:54] Statue of a perfect man well we go a
[52:58] little ways to go here and if you've
[53:01] gone through the course of the day
[53:03] you've seen where you follow where
[53:05] you've been overcome by evil where you
[53:07] just haven't had the answer to fix a
[53:09] problem what we need to reduce ourselves
[53:12] humble ourselves and and realize that
[53:15] there's a need inside of me and that
[53:18] need has to be taken care of in order
[53:21] for me to to help a situation or to
[53:23] overcome this thing that I'm in James
[53:29] chapter 4 verse 6 I know I'm jumping
[53:31] around a little bit but want to use
[53:34] these scriptures James says but but he
[53:38] giveth more grace wherefore he saith God
[53:42] resists the proud and he giveth grace to
[53:46] the humble so we need to MIT we need
[53:50] more help from the Lord we just need to
[53:52] admit that that's what that means to
[53:54] humble yourself is admit you need help
[53:58] not I'm here at church to learn you can
[54:03] go to college to learn you can watch so
[54:09] many things and learn so many things
[54:12] from so many people but we need help
[54:15] we've got inside amen praise the Lord we
[54:21] don't need more convincing that were
[54:25] okay when we go to church yeah yeah
[54:28] you're you're the bride don't forget
[54:29] that if we're forgetting who we are we
[54:37] probably ought to be spending a little
[54:39] bit more time with our Father in prayer
[54:43] and church is is there to encourage us
[54:50] by a long shot and to build our faith a
[54:53] message needs to build a faith but now
[54:57] the thing is church does not take the
[54:59] place of your walk with God
[55:03] we just don't got that kind of time
[55:05] we don't got that kind of time and God
[55:10] is want to do a short work in us a quick
[55:14] work in us and and and we need to be
[55:18] taking care of the things that we know
[55:20] to which you know spending more time in
[55:22] prayer spend more time getting prepared
[55:25] because I believe at least in when I see
[55:31] a with this ministry God is trying to
[55:35] get us to a place he's trying to really
[55:38] get us ready for a rapture and it's not
[55:40] something you float into or ease your
[55:42] way into it's something you have to
[55:44] press your way into and the righteous
[55:47] scarcely make it they barely make it and
[55:50] and and I think sometimes the the enemy
[55:54] or the the evil tries to get us in in a
[56:00] in a lukewarm lair to see a spot where
[56:03] we come to church and we're just looking
[56:05] for certain things to help us with what
[56:08] we want help with instead of realizing
[56:11] that we're here to learn more about our
[56:14] armor and and and and how to be an
[56:16] overcomer and how to get ready so I
[56:19] praise the Lord for this opportunity
[56:22] verse number seven says submit
[56:24] yourselves therefore to God resist the
[56:29] devil and he will flee from you so the
[56:32] way to overcome is to submit yourself to
[56:37] God discuses be not overcome of evil but
[56:41] overcome evil with good there's a
[56:43] submission that is needed in order for
[56:46] you to take care of these problems that
[56:49] have to do outwardly here
[56:51] something has to take place on the
[56:53] inside if we're supposed to overcome
[56:56] evil with good we're only gonna fail
[57:00] with our own or with ourselves because
[57:05] there's no goodness in us there is no
[57:08] good in us amen
[57:10] look at Romans chapter seven I was
[57:13] talking to a brother this morning and
[57:16] these were already in my nose
[57:19] but he began to quote some scriptures
[57:22] here verse number 18 for I know that in
[57:28] me that is my flesh now in me dwelleth
[57:32] no good thing so how are we going to
[57:34] overcome the evil if there's no good in
[57:38] us for two we'll look at these he's
[57:43] describing the evil that's inside of him
[57:45] now for two we'll to do the right thing
[57:51] it's present with me but how to perform
[57:54] that which is good I can't find it it's
[57:58] like a Missy like something is missing
[58:00] my intent is there my desires there I
[58:03] want to do good but something's missing
[58:06] I just can't do it in himself in his
[58:10] flesh for the good that it would like to
[58:15] do i do not but the evil which I would
[58:20] not intend to do that I find myself
[58:22] doing now if I do that which I would not
[58:27] intend to do it is no more I that do it
[58:31] but evil it's sin that dwelleth in me
[58:37] that's who is doing it I find then a law
[58:42] that when I would go to do good evil is
[58:46] present with me it's inside of me to
[58:49] stop me from doing it it's here not up
[58:52] there is inside for I delight in the law
[58:58] of God after the inward man
[59:00] it's a beautiful law that desire and and
[59:05] God's power and his ability and and his
[59:12] desire for me to to do good the Word of
[59:16] God is perfect and and Paul saying I I
[59:19] delight in the law of God but he said I
[59:22] see another law warring in my members
[59:27] Amen I see another law in my members
[59:30] it's the law of sin
[59:32] so there's another law inside of him
[59:34] that I do not delight in basically he
[59:37] doesn't delight in this other law that
[59:40] he sees he says it's warring against the
[59:43] law of my mind it's coming against my
[59:47] mind because my mind is one to do the
[59:49] right thing but something happens in my
[59:51] mind and it wars against it it keeps me
[59:54] from doing the things that I want to do
[59:56] the right things and bringing me into
[59:59] captivity to the law of sin which is in
[1:00:03] my members so in other words he sees
[1:00:06] himself being overcomed
[1:00:09] of evil it's all on the inside of us
[1:00:13] Saints Paul is seeking an escape from
[1:00:19] this battle and he cries out Oh wretched
[1:00:24] man that I am Who Shall deliver me from
[1:00:27] this body from the body of this death
[1:00:31] well Christ is the answer the spirit of
[1:00:35] the Living God is the answer is him on
[1:00:37] the inside that's who's going to deliver
[1:00:40] him who delivered him and who's gonna
[1:00:44] deliver us praise God Philippians
[1:00:46] chapter 4 verse number 11 no not that I
[1:00:52] speak in respect of what so Paul is not
[1:00:56] speaking about his what wanting for I
[1:01:01] have learned in whatsoever state
[1:01:02] therewith to be content you know a lot
[1:01:04] of times we want something and we hear
[1:01:06] our significant other or mom and dad or
[1:01:10] our boss or somebody say you need to be
[1:01:13] content with what you have that's all we
[1:01:14] got right now just be content with that
[1:01:16] and Paul is not speaking in respect of
[1:01:19] wanting nothing about his wants here and
[1:01:22] he makes this statement he says I know
[1:01:25] both how to be abased and I know how to
[1:01:29] abound everywhere and in all things I am
[1:01:34] instructed both to be full and to be
[1:01:38] hungry both to abound and to suffer need
[1:01:43] so it's all
[1:01:46] experiences that Christ puts them
[1:01:49] through that he has learned to be
[1:01:52] content it didn't matter
[1:01:55] hungry not hungry in need suffering or
[1:01:59] everything's wonderful I've learned to
[1:02:01] be content he says I can do all things
[1:02:07] through Christ which strengtheneth me
[1:02:10] and praise God I know there's probably
[1:02:12] some of you that thought of that
[1:02:14] scripture when we began talking how to
[1:02:16] how to overcome evil with good well the
[1:02:20] only good there is is Christ there's
[1:02:24] none good but one that that's God
[1:02:27] there's no good thing that dwelleth in
[1:02:29] US will seek in our own way to wanting
[1:02:32] to do her own thing but it's through
[1:02:34] Christ that Paul was able to overcome
[1:02:39] evil with good it was Christ in him he
[1:02:42] said the life that I now live in the
[1:02:44] flesh I live by the faith of the son it
[1:02:46] was Christ in him and it gave him power
[1:02:48] to overcome somebody yelling at him
[1:02:51] somebody cutting him off somebody just
[1:02:53] you know not showing up to work somebody
[1:02:55] that swore at you somebody that didn't
[1:02:57] do what they told you they promised to
[1:02:59] do whatever it might be if Christ is
[1:03:03] preeminent Paul said when I'm weak then
[1:03:08] he is strong and he can be strong inside
[1:03:12] of us to overcome that the the rampant
[1:03:16] anger and the keep us from erupting a
[1:03:19] wrong nature our tongue spitting out
[1:03:21] some poison that's how we overcome the
[1:03:25] evil that's inside of us it's really
[1:03:28] receiving more of Christ I know we got
[1:03:31] the Holy Ghost but we need more and not
[1:03:36] only do we need more we need to learn to
[1:03:38] you too we have more and there's that
[1:03:41] that battle in that war in our mind I
[1:03:44] would go to do good but evil is present
[1:03:46] and we've got to learn to bring that
[1:03:51] situation under the control of the Holy
[1:03:55] Spirit and I want to just try to spend a
[1:03:57] few of
[1:03:59] little bit talking about that amen it's
[1:04:03] through the goodness of Christ that we
[1:04:07] overcome the evil that's in our life
[1:04:10] amen and we're going to overcome the
[1:04:15] evil with good
[1:04:17] God's goodness not our goodness not how
[1:04:22] good we are how much favor we have with
[1:04:27] somebody or a reputation or our are a
[1:04:33] way that we can influence somebody and
[1:04:37] and and and and and be able to be tell
[1:04:43] somebody how you know wonderful they are
[1:04:45] to keep them from you know getting upset
[1:04:49] now we just need God goodness inside of
[1:04:53] it it's a goodness of God that led us to
[1:04:56] repentance and it's going to be the
[1:04:58] goodness of God in us that overcomes all
[1:05:01] evil amen
[1:05:02] all evil if we humble ourselves to the
[1:05:06] Spirit of God he'll meet us and he'll
[1:05:09] meet the need that we have in our life
[1:05:11] but we need to humble ourselves enough
[1:05:13] now catch this we need to humble
[1:05:16] ourselves enough to submit to God if we
[1:05:19] only humble ourselves a little bit
[1:05:20] because we're you know being bothered
[1:05:22] right now and oh yeah I guess I'm just
[1:05:24] trying to push my will and I just humble
[1:05:26] myself a little bit but you really don't
[1:05:28] submit to God then you miss out of what
[1:05:32] it really takes to be an overcomer what
[1:05:36] what it really means to submit to the
[1:05:39] will of God is to lay down your life
[1:05:41] that's what it means that's what it
[1:05:44] means to help yourself lay down your
[1:05:46] will lay down your life lay down the
[1:05:49] direction that you're trying to go and
[1:05:52] let the life of Christ have his way
[1:05:55] inside of us the Spirit of the Living
[1:05:59] God inside of us overcoming the evil
[1:06:02] that rises up against the will of God
[1:06:04] which is to be willing to suffer that
[1:06:09] god may use your life to win souls I
[1:06:11] know that's
[1:06:12] big statement but I'm gonna by the grace
[1:06:15] of God take the rest of this time and
[1:06:17] show you perhaps a little bit different
[1:06:21] picture about overcoming evil you know
[1:06:25] God has a will for our life and we have
[1:06:28] our will and of course then we have
[1:06:31] Satan who's trying to give us a lot more
[1:06:35] of his will which is let your flesh have
[1:06:38] its way and it creates a tremendous
[1:06:41] battle turn with me to second
[1:06:43] Corinthians chapter four verse number
[1:06:45] seven 2nd Corinthians chapter four verse
[1:06:48] number seven says but we have this
[1:06:50] treasure in earthen vessels we have the
[1:06:54] Holy Ghost mm-hmm we have the Lord Jesus
[1:06:57] Christ we have our Savior in our vessels
[1:07:01] and it's a treasure that the excellency
[1:07:04] of the power may be of God and not of us
[1:07:09] it's his goodness and what look what did
[1:07:13] it do for you
[1:07:14] we are troubled on every side yet we're
[1:07:18] not distressed no Paul talked about he's
[1:07:21] learned in whatever state he's it
[1:07:22] therein to be content right so we're
[1:07:26] troubled on every side yet we're not
[1:07:28] distressed
[1:07:29] we're perplexed but we're not despair
[1:07:32] we're persecuted don't we're not
[1:07:35] forsaken we're cast down but we're not
[1:07:38] destroyed always bearing about in the
[1:07:43] body in our body the dying of the Lord
[1:07:47] Jesus we got to remember that we've got
[1:07:49] to continue dying all I die daily not
[1:07:52] just once in the morning once at night
[1:07:55] but through the day and you'll know when
[1:07:58] you need to die because you'll be faced
[1:08:01] with the situation so we're always
[1:08:05] bearing about it's like a present tense
[1:08:07] it's like our God is a is a present help
[1:08:11] in a time of trouble he's presently
[1:08:13] there well we have to presently be dying
[1:08:17] out in order for God to give us the help
[1:08:20] that we're looking for
[1:08:21] we just can't continue in our flesh and
[1:08:23] expect God to be helping us and
[1:08:26] we want help we got our part to play
[1:08:28] here and Paul saying always bearing
[1:08:30] always bearing your-your-your burying it
[1:08:33] about in the body the dying of the Lord
[1:08:36] Jesus that the life also might be made
[1:08:39] manifest in our bodies now I want you to
[1:08:42] catch that brother Jason what brother
[1:08:44] what brother Bruce was bringing about
[1:08:46] the manifestation of Christ in our life
[1:08:49] earlier today there's a part that we
[1:08:52] have to prep to play and and prayer
[1:08:56] helps puts us in a condition to
[1:08:58] recognize our need of the Lord and to
[1:09:01] focus more on that because if we do our
[1:09:06] part and die out to our will then God
[1:09:08] can do his part be manifest in our life
[1:09:10] and take care of the need amen
[1:09:12] verse 11 for we which live are always
[1:09:16] delivered unto the death for Jesus sake
[1:09:18] that the life also of Jesus might be
[1:09:21] made manifest in our mortal flesh
[1:09:26] we're always delivered unto death always
[1:09:31] we just got to say yes to it we don't
[1:09:34] want to fight it we don't want to
[1:09:35] currently fight these battles God knows
[1:09:39] what he's doing
[1:09:40] verse 12 so then death worketh in US but
[1:09:45] life and you notice why you're dying
[1:09:47] notice why you got to bear the death of
[1:09:51] the dying of the Lord Jesus so Christ
[1:09:55] can manifest himself inside of us and
[1:09:58] bring life to somebody now it's not
[1:10:05] about us it's about God it's about his
[1:10:10] purpose in his will it's about living
[1:10:13] for others so if we're talking about
[1:10:14] eternal life is living for others then
[1:10:20] somehow when we're going through this
[1:10:22] this term Oh down here and there's
[1:10:24] complex problems at work and at home and
[1:10:27] our neighbors and the bills and the
[1:10:29] finances somewhere down the line the
[1:10:35] life of Christ has to be manifested
[1:10:37] inside of you so somebody asked
[1:10:39] see it and grab on to life and say
[1:10:42] that's Jesus
[1:10:44] that's drill Jesus because otherwise
[1:10:46] people just look at you getting upset
[1:10:48] and getting bothered and that's just
[1:10:50] like normal
[1:10:51] hey that's normal so we have a part to
[1:10:55] play here amen
[1:10:56] so death worketh in US but life in you
[1:10:59] the death for Jesus sake what is death
[1:11:03] for Jesus sake
[1:11:08] it's Calvary it's God's purpose what is
[1:11:12] the sake of Jesus what is the purpose of
[1:11:17] God it was to see people saved and
[1:11:21] that's the purpose that that death must
[1:11:26] be working in us that others can see the
[1:11:29] life of Christ they're not going to see
[1:11:31] how good John Martin is well if anybody
[1:11:34] stayed enough time with John Myers if
[1:11:36] anybody's heard one of John Martin
[1:11:38] sermon they're gonna see there's not a
[1:11:39] whole lot of good in John Martin he's
[1:11:42] he's missing some marbles but hopefully
[1:11:48] they're gonna see the life of Christ cuz
[1:11:50] that's what it's all about amen first
[1:11:52] Corinthians chapter 9 let's try to go
[1:11:54] through these because I don't where we
[1:11:56] got our time is is getting away so I
[1:11:58] need you to say Amen let's get it going
[1:12:00] brother John 1st Corinthians chapter 9
[1:12:02] verse number 19 for though I be free
[1:12:06] from all men yet have I made myself
[1:12:09] servant unto all that I might gain the
[1:12:12] more so we see the purpose of God
[1:12:14] working through the life of Paul we've
[1:12:19] talked about it many times when God
[1:12:21] called him he told him that he's gonna
[1:12:23] show him things that he was gonna have
[1:12:24] to suffer that he might win a lot of
[1:12:26] people and he gravitated to his calling
[1:12:29] he said yes I'm willing I don't want to
[1:12:32] be just a Christian I want to be willing
[1:12:34] to die out to my will that I could
[1:12:35] accomplish saving as many people as I
[1:12:38] can and he says here in the opening
[1:12:39] statement for though I'd be free I've
[1:12:41] been set free God has saved me he's
[1:12:44] taking all my sins away I subject myself
[1:12:46] yet they make myself a servant unto all
[1:12:50] for the purpose that I might gain
[1:12:53] the more there must have been quite a
[1:12:57] battle going on inside a pause mine for
[1:13:04] him to have to surrender constantly of
[1:13:08] just getting beat up and stoned and
[1:13:11] shipwreck and false brethren and just so
[1:13:15] many negative things coming out of his
[1:13:16] life constantly there must have been
[1:13:19] such a battle in his mind he had
[1:13:26] overcome it
[1:13:27] he had overcome it his flesh wanted to
[1:13:32] be served just like yours and mine but
[1:13:35] he had to crucify that in order with his
[1:13:39] spirit to serve the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:13:42] and you serve the Lord Jesus Christ by
[1:13:45] how you serve your brother how you serve
[1:13:48] your sister you want to do something
[1:13:50] good for God do it for his children
[1:13:54] verse number 20 Paul made himself a
[1:14:00] servant to all he said to the Jews he
[1:14:03] became as a Jew under the law as under
[1:14:07] the law without the law without the laws
[1:14:12] without the law verse number 22 to the
[1:14:16] week became I as weak that I might gain
[1:14:22] the week I am made all things to all man
[1:14:26] for one purpose I need to show off I
[1:14:31] need to need to gain favor that he might
[1:14:35] be able to impose his popularity upon a
[1:14:39] person he became all things to all men
[1:14:43] for one purpose that he might bring them
[1:14:46] to Jesus Christ and if we have any other
[1:14:49] purpose we're missing we're missing the
[1:14:53] mark of overcoming all the evil
[1:15:01] verse 23 you're not going to get them
[1:15:06] all you're only gonna get some you have
[1:15:07] to become Christ everybody have to love
[1:15:10] unconditionally you have to get hurt by
[1:15:12] everybody you have to love everybody you
[1:15:14] have to forgive everybody else take a
[1:15:15] mile for everybody you know what out of
[1:15:17] that all that hard work they don't feel
[1:15:20] like you're getting much out of it if
[1:15:22] some gets saved you're fulfilling the
[1:15:26] perfect will of God for your life that's
[1:15:29] your calling amen
[1:15:30] verse number 20 I'm sorry verse number
[1:15:32] 23 and this I do for the Gospels sake
[1:15:37] that I might be partaker with you now
[1:15:41] notice this he knew his going to heaven
[1:15:44] he knew he had a revelation of who his
[1:15:46] father was he knew he was going to
[1:15:49] heaven but you know what he wasn't
[1:15:51] satisfied with just him going to heaven
[1:15:53] he wanted to be a partaker with somebody
[1:15:55] else so he gave up his life that he
[1:15:59] could spend eternity with just one more
[1:16:01] person just one more he wanted to partay
[1:16:07] he want to sit that long table in heaven
[1:16:10] and have fellowship and partake and and
[1:16:13] talk for a thousand years he wanted that
[1:16:16] connection
[1:16:17] he wasn't just happy that his life was
[1:16:20] taken squared away mm-hmm know ye not
[1:16:24] that they which run in a race run all
[1:16:29] but one receiveth the prize so run that
[1:16:34] she may obtain in other words it is a
[1:16:37] personal affair and you are running you
[1:16:41] are not running against your brother and
[1:16:42] sister you are not running against a
[1:16:47] non-believer you're you're not running
[1:16:49] against the people of this world you've
[1:16:53] got a nature inside of you
[1:16:56] that the only way it's demolished is to
[1:17:01] die daily the only way it's not
[1:17:05] repenting getting baptized and it's all
[1:17:07] over no that's when the battle just
[1:17:08] starts but you're in a race every day
[1:17:12] you get up mm-hmm you don't
[1:17:15] your sneakers on you don't drink your
[1:17:18] old J you don't eat your Wheaties you
[1:17:22] don't submit yourself to God you don't
[1:17:25] die out I'm telling you that other man
[1:17:27] is going to take the upper hand in the
[1:17:29] race that day so he says run that he may
[1:17:33] obtain and every man that striveth for
[1:17:36] the mastery
[1:17:37] he's temperance in all things but they
[1:17:40] do it to obtain a corruptible crown but
[1:17:42] we an incorruptible crown I therefore so
[1:17:46] run not as uncertainly so fight I not as
[1:17:51] one that beateth the air I hope I'm
[1:17:53] doing the right thing I hope this is
[1:17:55] accomplishing something no he knew what
[1:17:59] he had to do he had to keep his body
[1:18:04] control his body and bring it under
[1:18:06] subjection lest by any means when i have
[1:18:10] preached to others i myself should be a
[1:18:13] castaway and i'll tell you we're all
[1:18:15] guilty of sharing the gospel with
[1:18:19] somebody what they need to do and being
[1:18:22] guilty of the very same thing and I
[1:18:29] don't believe Paul it by any means was
[1:18:33] losing his salvation that's not what he
[1:18:36] was meaning but he's bringing a point
[1:18:40] across that we have to keep our body
[1:18:44] under subjection we just can't let it go
[1:18:46] and say well we're in the message I'm
[1:18:48] the first a messenger and I'm writing 14
[1:18:51] books in the Bible and I I'm really good
[1:18:53] to go no he had to bring his body into
[1:18:56] subjection why because God had a work
[1:18:58] for him he had to willingly become a
[1:19:01] servant to all that he might win some
[1:19:03] that he might be partakers with some in
[1:19:06] having he had that vision without a
[1:19:07] vision the people perished
[1:19:09] Jesus Christ had a vision he gave that
[1:19:11] vision Nepal and he's here today he's
[1:19:14] alive today he's not dead he's not gone
[1:19:16] if we don't feel that vision not not
[1:19:20] just God help me to see what you want me
[1:19:23] to see the hours late the hours short
[1:19:25] don't get caught up in the things of
[1:19:27] this world don't get caught up
[1:19:28] the natural things that are just gonna
[1:19:30] disappear
[1:19:31] think about spending your time that's
[1:19:34] valuable you know as you get older time
[1:19:36] becomes more valuable when you're
[1:19:39] younger you think you got so much time
[1:19:41] you just want to do anything anything
[1:19:43] that your flesh wants after a while you
[1:19:46] realize that time is valuable and you
[1:19:49] want to do something different with your
[1:19:50] time than bullet you want to spend it
[1:19:52] with your family you want to to to have
[1:19:56] some value to you want to express love
[1:19:58] you want to do things that you wanted to
[1:20:00] do all your life and could do and I'm
[1:20:02] telling you the hour is late Jesus is
[1:20:05] coming and we need to spend our time
[1:20:07] very valuable to be wise understand that
[1:20:11] that we we gotta take advantage of them
[1:20:14] very little time that we have left over
[1:20:16] to be the servant that God has called us
[1:20:18] to be amen praise the Lord
[1:20:21] don't know where I was out right now but
[1:20:25] Paul was able to see that the law of sin
[1:20:29] was inside of him and he had to fight
[1:20:32] that battle he had her keep his body
[1:20:35] under subjection it was like a war zone
[1:20:38] in his mind and he had to bring these
[1:20:41] thoughts into captivity that's what he
[1:20:44] said right he also shared the same
[1:20:47] understanding in the Corinthian church
[1:20:49] and I just want to go there with you
[1:20:50] right now
[1:20:51] to second Corinthians chapter 10 verse
[1:20:53] number 3 for though we walk in the flesh
[1:20:55] we do not war after the flesh for the
[1:20:59] weapons of our warfare they're not
[1:21:00] carnal but they're mighty through God to
[1:21:03] the pulling down of strongholds so it's
[1:21:05] up here casting down imaginations and
[1:21:08] every high thing that exalteth itself
[1:21:09] against the knowledge of God and
[1:21:11] bringing into captivity every evil
[1:21:14] thought to the obedience of Christ and
[1:21:16] having a readiness to revenge all
[1:21:18] disobedience when your obedience is
[1:21:20] fulfilled now notice what is required
[1:21:22] isn't just okay I got to get those
[1:21:24] thoughts out of my head no an obedience
[1:21:28] is required an obedience
[1:21:30] something is required that means there's
[1:21:34] a battle going on what obedience is
[1:21:36] required it's to lay down your life
[1:21:40] that's what
[1:21:41] is required we don't war after the flesh
[1:21:49] our battle is a spiritual battle and it
[1:21:53] takes a humbling of our evil thoughts
[1:21:56] that are high and proud and feel just
[1:22:00] too good to lay down their life those
[1:22:05] are some pretty high falleth they
[1:22:08] actually exalting themselves against the
[1:22:12] knowledge of God will never overcome
[1:22:17] with our goodness thinking that we don't
[1:22:19] have to cast down certain thoughts in
[1:22:22] our head that tell us that we don't have
[1:22:25] to surrender our lives anymore to God
[1:22:27] than what we already done I gave him my
[1:22:30] life
[1:22:31] well everybody that comes to God accepts
[1:22:35] him as a savior and from that point
[1:22:37] forward they learn how to make Jesus
[1:22:40] their Lord and to take more of a control
[1:22:43] of their life I go through a course of a
[1:22:46] day and it's not hard for me to see
[1:22:48] where Jesus hasn't had control so I need
[1:22:53] to lay down my life and it needs not to
[1:22:58] be about me the light that needs to be
[1:23:00] lived is about those who are watching me
[1:23:02] those are they interact with those are
[1:23:04] the ones that that need Christ so this
[1:23:09] is the commandment and we know this in
[1:23:11] the Bible to love one another
[1:23:14] that's the commandment to love one
[1:23:17] another to love them enough that you're
[1:23:19] willing to lay down your life we can say
[1:23:21] we love one another but are we willing
[1:23:23] to lay down our will our desire our
[1:23:29] popularity or popular opinion or
[1:23:32] manipulation are what we want to get out
[1:23:34] of the relationship are we you know
[1:23:38] where are we willing to lay it all down
[1:23:42] do we love others enough to lay down our
[1:23:48] will to bring Christ to somebody
[1:23:53] be not overcome of evil but overcome
[1:23:55] evil with love there's only one good
[1:24:02] that's God and God is love
[1:24:04] it takes love the love of God in your
[1:24:07] heart that'll make you a servant to all
[1:24:14] you love God so much it's the love of
[1:24:16] Christ that constrains us that's how we
[1:24:20] overcome the evil that wants to just do
[1:24:24] its own will you know we can lash out
[1:24:26] and be negative and end and and say the
[1:24:29] wrong thing and we say we're sorry and
[1:24:31] that's that's normal and that's right
[1:24:33] but things don't have to get that far
[1:24:35] out there if we learn to control the
[1:24:38] evil inside of us and it takes God
[1:24:42] inside the Holy Ghost the love of God
[1:24:45] inside of us so how do we come how do we
[1:24:47] overcome took us this long to get to the
[1:24:52] end of the message so I hope you bear
[1:24:53] with me it starts with a lamb nature we
[1:24:58] were obedient to lay down our life as we
[1:25:02] are obedient to lay down our lives for
[1:25:04] one another you're overcoming the evil
[1:25:07] with God's goodness inside of you in
[1:25:09] other words you're not trying to do
[1:25:11] anything you're just obeying God you're
[1:25:13] you're you're bringing yourself under
[1:25:16] the obedience of Jesus Christ
[1:25:19] it takes a sacrificial life a humbling
[1:25:22] of yourself to fulfill the obedience
[1:25:25] that God requires and we'll see this a
[1:25:27] little bit more how did Jesus overcome
[1:25:30] he said be of good cheer for I have
[1:25:33] overcome the world he wanted us to is
[1:25:36] almost like him saying take a chill pill
[1:25:37] it's gonna be okay
[1:25:38] you're gonna overcome - because be of
[1:25:41] good cheer I have overcome and if he's
[1:25:43] living inside of us we're gonna overcome
[1:25:46] and so how did he overcome what did he
[1:25:52] have to overcome he had overcome his
[1:25:55] flesh that's what he had to overcome and
[1:25:59] how did he how did he do it he just laid
[1:26:03] it down he laid down
[1:26:06] like jesus said My father does love me
[1:26:08] because I lay down my life for the Sheep
[1:26:13] there was a love affair there he kept
[1:26:17] the father's Commandments revelations
[1:26:19] chapter five verse five and one of the
[1:26:23] outers saith unto John wheat not behold
[1:26:30] the Lion of the tribe of Judah the root
[1:26:32] of David have prevailed to open the book
[1:26:36] and to loose the seven seals thereof
[1:26:40] John he was so excited he had an
[1:26:49] expectation that when he would look at
[1:26:55] this one that prevailed it was going to
[1:26:58] be this great lion this king of the of
[1:27:04] the field the king of the of the
[1:27:07] wilderness is the lion and he had this
[1:27:11] expectation he was going to see this big
[1:27:13] rough terrible animal that was just so
[1:27:17] had the ability to prevail and when he
[1:27:20] looked he saw an obedient lamb that had
[1:27:26] just been slain he saw a surrendered
[1:27:33] life
[1:27:37] and Pilate thought he had power over
[1:27:41] Jesus control over this King said you
[1:27:46] don't got no power you have no power all
[1:27:49] power is given unto me but he laid down
[1:27:53] his life John said behold the lamb of
[1:27:56] God that taketh away the sin throne he
[1:27:59] laid down his life
[1:28:01] that's how we overcame it through him
[1:28:05] laying down his life for us
[1:28:07] how are those people out there going to
[1:28:10] overcome by you laying down your life
[1:28:12] how are you gonna overcome the evil
[1:28:14] that's trying to erupt this corrupted
[1:28:16] nature inside of you by you laying down
[1:28:18] your will for the further for God to
[1:28:22] come in and and live out his will
[1:28:25] through you now Ted we have a purpose in
[1:28:28] it there's a reason we're going through
[1:28:29] suffering there's a reason somebody
[1:28:30] yells at you there's a reason we we're
[1:28:33] attacked the way we are God is trying to
[1:28:38] get more control of our life he wants to
[1:28:41] take our life and demonstrate Jesus
[1:28:46] Christ to those that everybody's looking
[1:28:48] at as we're being attacked
[1:28:53] God wants to put you on display just
[1:28:57] like he put job on display God wants to
[1:29:05] put us all on display
[1:29:08] praise the Lord
[1:29:12] Jesus overcame evil so the obedience of
[1:29:16] laying down his life and that is how we
[1:29:20] overcome evil the evil inside of us by
[1:29:25] laying down our will to share God's will
[1:29:32] with others and there's the purpose we
[1:29:37] don't want to allow our evil nature to
[1:29:39] to overcome our desire to do good for
[1:29:42] God we don't want that we've got to lay
[1:29:45] down our flesh see will and and do the
[1:29:48] will of the Father
[1:29:51] men God hides himself in simplicity he
[1:29:55] hides his will he hides his guidance his
[1:29:59] is leadership for our lives the
[1:30:02] overcoming power it's it's hid in
[1:30:08] simplicity and I'll say it like this
[1:30:13] most of the time our flesh doesn't want
[1:30:18] to yield to suffering oh I don't think I
[1:30:23] should have I don't think I shut the lay
[1:30:24] down my life I don't think that I should
[1:30:26] have to do that God God suffer for me I
[1:30:28] should have to suffer and yet God is
[1:30:30] right there
[1:30:32] hid in simplicity we miss it it just
[1:30:34] goes over I had because our flesh can't
[1:30:37] grasp that it's the will of God turn
[1:30:40] with me to Romans chapter 12 and I want
[1:30:42] to hmm I want to go through this kind of
[1:30:45] as quick as I can because I know that
[1:30:47] time is coming up and I just I just need
[1:30:51] you to compare to bear with me this
[1:30:56] great chapter starts out in verse 1 I
[1:30:58] beseech you therefore brethren by the
[1:31:00] mercies of God that you present your
[1:31:03] bodies a living sacrifice holy and
[1:31:08] acceptable unto God which is your
[1:31:10] reasonable service so in other words
[1:31:12] laying down your life is the commandment
[1:31:15] of God and Paul saying it's your
[1:31:17] reasonable service look I have to do it
[1:31:19] you have to do it this is how you
[1:31:21] overcome this is remember the last verse
[1:31:24] in this chapters be not overcome of evil
[1:31:25] but overcome evil good and we're going
[1:31:27] to see how it works when we read this
[1:31:30] and be not conformed to this world but
[1:31:34] be transformed by the renewing of your
[1:31:36] mind that you may prove what is that
[1:31:38] good and acceptable and perfect will of
[1:31:40] God
[1:31:40] our carnal mind wars after the flesh
[1:31:44] using our carnal weapons of imagination
[1:31:49] and evil thoughts and we yield to those
[1:31:52] things and we begin to to to to have
[1:31:55] some sort of drama we don't want to
[1:31:57] shake somebody's hand and we don't want
[1:31:59] to talk to somebody for a while we just
[1:32:00] we is carnal that's what that's how we
[1:32:04] think
[1:32:05] overcome a situation is with a carnal
[1:32:08] nine but what we need is we can't be
[1:32:13] conformed to this world but be
[1:32:15] transformed by the renewing of our mind
[1:32:19] what is that mind that renewing is the
[1:32:22] mind of Christ Philippians chapter 2
[1:32:25] verse number 5 and we'll get back to
[1:32:28] this we're not gonna read all of it let
[1:32:31] this mind be in you which was also in
[1:32:34] Christ Jesus who being in the form of
[1:32:36] God thought that robbery to be equal
[1:32:38] with God but what did he do he made
[1:32:40] himself of no reputation he took upon
[1:32:42] him the form of a servant just like Paul
[1:32:44] and was made in the likeness of men and
[1:32:47] being found in fashion as a man he
[1:32:52] humbled himself we're looking at where
[1:32:55] the victory is coming now how to
[1:32:57] overcome and he became obedient unto
[1:33:00] death even the death of the cross and
[1:33:02] this is how you prove what is that good
[1:33:05] and acceptable and perfect will of God
[1:33:08] it's by you hump on yourself and
[1:33:10] becoming obedient and that's what Paul
[1:33:13] starting now you want to overcome evil
[1:33:15] with good present your body a living
[1:33:17] sacrifice let's drop down to verse 9 in
[1:33:20] Romans chapter 12 let love be without
[1:33:24] dissimulation there's nothing so cold as
[1:33:28] love without sincerity this is nothing
[1:33:34] so cold it's just it's just a hypocracy
[1:33:37] it's like a respective persons it's no
[1:33:40] problem anybody can love somebody they
[1:33:42] want to love and not love somebody they
[1:33:44] don't want to or fake it because they
[1:33:47] know they should but it takes a dying
[1:33:51] out of the flesh to love everybody
[1:33:54] unconditional to have love without
[1:33:56] dissimulation abhor that which is evil
[1:33:59] do that which is good be kind ly
[1:34:01] affectionate one toward another with
[1:34:03] brotherly love in honour preferring one
[1:34:05] another you know it's hard to prefer one
[1:34:07] another when you think you're better
[1:34:08] than somebody it's a dying out to prove
[1:34:13] what is there good and acceptable it is
[1:34:15] how you overcome the evil inside of you
[1:34:20] not slothful in business fervent spirit
[1:34:24] serving the Lord rejoicing in Hope
[1:34:27] patient in tribulation I've learned to
[1:34:31] be content whatever state I'm in patient
[1:34:33] tribulation it's hard to be patient
[1:34:35] tribulation continuing instant in prayer
[1:34:39] it's hard to do that when your flesh
[1:34:40] don't want to pray distributing to the
[1:34:44] necessity of the Saints I wonder how
[1:34:46] many of us have even thought about
[1:34:50] distributing to the necessity of the
[1:34:52] saints think about it we're we're we're
[1:34:56] we're we're usually busy trying to take
[1:34:59] care of her own necessities given to
[1:35:03] hospitality we'll have to put this one
[1:35:06] in practice down the road when we can
[1:35:08] come together bless them which persecute
[1:35:12] you bless and curse not what an emphasis
[1:35:15] bless them would persecute you why
[1:35:18] didn't it just stop there no it said it
[1:35:20] again bless and curse not because the
[1:35:22] tendency is our tongue that's evil it
[1:35:26] wants to go in and say something that we
[1:35:28] don't like about what that person did so
[1:35:32] it takes a dying out to overcome the
[1:35:35] evil that's inside of us all requires
[1:35:41] laying down our lives and presenting our
[1:35:45] bodies a living sacrifice rejoice with
[1:35:47] them that do rejoice weep with them that
[1:35:49] weep be of the same mind one toward
[1:35:52] another that's the mind of Christ mind
[1:35:54] not high things but condescend to men of
[1:35:57] low estate be not wise in your own
[1:35:59] conceits recompense to no man evil for
[1:36:02] evil you're not overcoming evil with
[1:36:04] good you need to give somebody something
[1:36:07] good when they give you evil praise God
[1:36:10] what an honor it is to let the Lord
[1:36:13] Jesus Christ and His goodness work
[1:36:15] through you to give good on to somebody
[1:36:18] that does evil to you or that has an
[1:36:21] evil intent that just don't care that
[1:36:24] just be literacy that's sarcastic or is
[1:36:26] dramatized there just gives you a cold
[1:36:29] shoulder what an honor it is to let
[1:36:31] Lord Jesus Christ use your vessel the
[1:36:33] goodness of God to overcome that evil
[1:36:36] that you're presented with oh I just
[1:36:39] love that recompense to no man evil for
[1:36:43] evil provide things honestly in the
[1:36:44] sight of all men and if it's possible if
[1:36:47] it be possible as much that lieth in you
[1:36:51] live peaceably with all men
[1:36:54] dearly beloved you know what if you're a
[1:36:58] peacemaker you're gonna have a lot more
[1:37:00] chance livin peaceably for somebody but
[1:37:03] if you don't know how to be a peacemaker
[1:37:04] you know what you're doing you're
[1:37:05] totally relying on somebody else to do
[1:37:09] all the work - for them to say I'm sorry
[1:37:12] for them to say you know I shouldn't
[1:37:14] have done that but if you're a
[1:37:15] peacemaker you know how to bring about
[1:37:18] peace dearly beloved avenge not
[1:37:22] yourselves avenge not yourself don't try
[1:37:25] to handle yourself
[1:37:27] but rather give place unto wrath for it
[1:37:29] is written vengeance is mine I will
[1:37:31] repay saith what let the Lord take care
[1:37:34] of it
[1:37:35] you just lay yourself down and overcome
[1:37:40] as Jesus did as a lamb therefore if a
[1:37:45] enemy hunger don't tell him well go get
[1:37:51] it yourself
[1:37:52] feed him if he thirst give him a drink
[1:37:55] for in do sowing thou shalt heap coals
[1:37:57] of fire on his head it's the
[1:37:59] manifestation of the word be not
[1:38:02] overcome of evil but overcome evil with
[1:38:07] God with love with dying out to present
[1:38:12] the love of God one verse first John
[1:38:16] chapter 5 verse number 4 for whatsoever
[1:38:21] is born of God overcometh the world and
[1:38:29] this is the victory that overcometh the
[1:38:33] world even our faith you've got to have
[1:38:39] faith that if you lay down your life
[1:38:44] is going to to give you the victory in
[1:38:50] your life a lot of times we want to take
[1:38:54] control the handle we want to take
[1:38:56] control the the steering wheel we want
[1:38:58] to take control of the situation we
[1:39:01] don't have faith that God can do it to
[1:39:02] us we have faith that we can handle it
[1:39:05] so we try to do it and it don't work and
[1:39:08] then we feel down and our goal is to
[1:39:16] have faith that Christ in us if we lay
[1:39:21] down oh if we humble ourselves that God
[1:39:23] inside of us is going to become strong
[1:39:26] and overcome that evil that's trying to
[1:39:28] to have our nature just erupt when we
[1:39:32] don't want to rock amen god bless you
[1:39:35] stand with me be not overcome of evil
