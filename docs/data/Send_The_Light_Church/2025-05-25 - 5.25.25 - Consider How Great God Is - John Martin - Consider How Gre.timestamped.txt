[37:24] It's a real beautiful thing. Uh before
[37:26] we begin reading here in 1 Samuel
[37:29] chapter 12, let's look to the author.
[37:31] Amen. Heavenly Father, we come to you
[37:34] with all of our needs and we have needs
[37:37] in our life. We have
[37:39] requests. We have
[37:41] desires. And Lord, you're able to do
[37:45] exceedingly above all that we ask or
[37:49] right now all that we're even could
[37:52] think. Thank you for knowing our hearts
[37:54] and thank you for being
[37:57] greater than all of our problems.
[38:02] Lord, we're asking today that you would
[38:05] lift up our faith because Lord, we know
[38:08] that there's nothing lacking in you and
[38:11] your ability to meet every one of our
[38:13] needs according to your riches and
[38:14] glory, Lord. But I believe that you have
[38:17] a requirement and that is that our faith
[38:19] would rise to the place that we could
[38:21] trust you for every need that we would
[38:23] have. Pray that through the ministry of
[38:26] the word, Lord, that our faith could
[38:28] increase and that we could just leave
[38:30] here believing with our hearts
[38:33] burning because Lord, you spoke to us
[38:37] personally. Lord, bless every heart.
[38:39] Bless the hearer, Lord. And bless Lord,
[38:43] thy unworthy servant, Lord. Let the
[38:45] words that come forth be anointed into
[38:48] the hearts of your people. We pray. We
[38:50] commit the service now into your hands.
[38:53] bring yourself glory and honor through
[38:56] everything that is said and done. Now we
[38:58] ask in Jesus Christ's precious name.
[39:00] Amen. Amen. 1 Samuel chapter 12. We're
[39:04] just going to read one verse there and
[39:06] that's verse number
[39:09] 24. Take our text from here. Only fear
[39:13] the Lord and serve him in truth with all
[39:16] your heart. For consider how great
[39:19] things he have done for you. Amen. Amen.
[39:23] And then also John chapter
[39:26] 21. And in here, this is the last
[39:31] verse in the book of St. John. Actually,
[39:35] it's the last verse of the four
[39:42] gospels speaking of Jesus here.
[39:48] And there are also many other things
[39:50] which Jesus
[39:52] did the which if they should be written
[39:55] every one I
[39:57] suppose that even the world itself could
[40:01] not contain the books that should be
[40:03] written. Amen. Amen. God bless you. You
[40:06] may be seated. Now you can see about
[40:09] counting your blessings.
[40:11] Amen. Amen. Consider how
[40:16] great things that God has done for
[40:19] us. God is always wanting us to consider
[40:23] things. He said one time, "What is a
[40:26] man's advantage if he gain the whole
[40:28] world and lose himself and be a
[40:29] castaway?" Just wanting us to consider
[40:32] having everything we want. The Bible
[40:35] says, "Go to the aunt and consider her
[40:37] ways and be wise."
[40:41] He says, "Now therefore, thus sayeth the
[40:44] Lord of hosts, consider your
[40:46] ways." The Bible says, "Come, let us
[40:49] reason together, sayeth the Lord." Jesus
[40:51] said, "Consider the liies of the field,
[40:53] how they grow, and they toil not,
[40:55] neither do they spin. Yet I say unto you
[40:57] that even Solomon, all his glory was not
[40:59] a raid like one of these."
[41:02] Jesus also said, "Consider the ravens,
[41:05] for they neither sow nor reap, neither
[41:08] which neither have storehouse nor barn
[41:10] and God feedth them. How much more are
[41:13] you better than the fowls?" So God is
[41:16] always wanting us to
[41:19] consider when he walked, he was always
[41:22] trying to get the people he talked with
[41:24] to consider whether they were his
[41:26] disciples or the Pharisees. Because when
[41:29] you consider something then where you're
[41:32] at, you're opening the door to
[41:35] grow. And and that's why brother Ram
[41:37] said, uh, I I could be wrong considering
[41:41] his situation that there's more to it.
[41:44] Paul being humble, he said, I need to
[41:46] press towards the mark. I I haven't
[41:48] apprehended. I'm not there. So I'm
[41:50] considering that I I'm not where I need
[41:52] to be.
[41:55] Paul told Timothy, "Consider what I say
[41:57] in the Lord give thee understanding in
[41:59] all
[42:01] things." Remember a story that Brother
[42:03] Johnson told many years ago about um a
[42:07] pig who sat under an apple tree and he
[42:10] was kind of a lazy
[42:13] pig and he just sat
[42:15] around eating and laying around. That
[42:19] was his life.
[42:22] And uh the apples would fall one at a
[42:27] time from the tree and just kind of like
[42:29] hit him on the head and then he would
[42:33] turn around and get the apple that just
[42:35] fell and start eating. But he he refused
[42:39] to look up to see where his blessings
[42:41] were coming from.
[42:43] He wouldn't consider
[42:46] God's grace.
[42:48] And a lot of times I think we forget to
[42:50] count our blessings.
[42:53] We don't
[42:54] consider what God has done for our lives
[42:58] because we're always wanting
[43:02] more. The scripture tells us in 1
[43:04] Thessalonians 5:18, "In everything give
[43:07] thanks, for this is the will of God in
[43:09] Christ Jesus concerning you." Even the
[43:11] trials that we're going through, we're
[43:13] supposed to count it all joy.
[43:15] So consider how great things God has
[43:19] done. Let's go to the beginning, the
[43:22] very beginning of your
[43:24] life. And first Ephesians 1 verse4 says,
[43:28] "According as he have chosen us in him,
[43:32] before the foundation of the world, that
[43:34] we should be holy and without blame
[43:36] before him in love." Right? So before
[43:40] there was ever a world, stars, galaxies,
[43:44] planets, before there was ever before
[43:47] God ever said, "Let there be light."
[43:49] Before there was anything, God chose
[43:52] you. That's right.
[43:55] Consider how great God is that he chose
[43:57] you. Amen.
[43:59] Hebrews 11:3 says, "Through faith we
[44:01] understand that the worlds were framed
[44:03] by the word of God, so that the things
[44:05] which are seen were not made which
[44:07] things that do
[44:08] appear." Before that ever happened, we
[44:11] were in the mind of God.
[44:14] And he said, "I chose you, Brother Ron
[44:16] Clayton. I chose
[44:20] you in his thoughts before we ever
[44:25] existed because he knows the end from
[44:27] the beginning. He knows them that are
[44:32] his. Consider how great God is
[44:36] today. Jesus said in John 15:16, "You
[44:40] have not chosen me, but I have chosen
[44:43] you. and have ordained you that you
[44:45] should go and bring forth fruit and that
[44:47] your fruit should remain and that what
[44:49] you shall ever ask in the father ask the
[44:51] father in my name he will give it to
[44:53] you. He chose you.
[44:58] Consider how great God is right now. He
[45:02] chose you out of a million other sperm
[45:04] cells. He chose only
[45:08] you. Think about it. in a in just in a
[45:11] in a second of God's thought, he could
[45:13] have he said, "Okay, this group is not
[45:15] coming and there's another group going
[45:16] to be
[45:17] here. He could have easily chose
[45:19] somebody else." But he chose us.
[45:23] That's enough to give God glory. Every
[45:25] single day we wake up that he chose us.
[45:30] Psalms 139:13 says, "For thou has
[45:33] possessed my
[45:35] reigns. Thou has covered me in my
[45:37] mother's womb.
[45:39] I will praise thee, for I am fearfully
[45:42] and wonderfully made. Marvelous are thy
[45:45] works, and that my soul knoweth right
[45:49] well. My substance was not hid from thee
[45:52] when I was made in secret, and curiously
[45:54] wrought in the lowest parts of the
[45:57] earth. Even David is expressing how
[46:01] great God is by the way that God made
[46:04] us.
[46:08] Even though we're amazingly made, we
[46:10] were all born in
[46:13] sin. David said, uh, "Behold, I was
[46:16] shapen in iniquity, and in sin did my
[46:19] mother conceive
[46:21] me." So, in other words, we came into
[46:25] existence the wrong
[46:29] way. And that's why we got to be born
[46:31] again.
[46:33] We were in the mind of God before the
[46:37] beginning, but we came out the wrong
[46:42] shoot. And you name it, we did it. We
[46:45] were lying before we even knew what
[46:47] lying was really
[46:49] was. We were deceiving and manipulating
[46:52] and making our parents feel guilty, bad,
[46:54] and wrong before we even knew what was
[46:56] if it was okay or not. because we had
[46:59] that nature inside of us to to do that.
[47:04] I
[47:05] mean, look, a child a a a young child,
[47:10] he knows the only way he can get what he
[47:13] wants is to
[47:16] manipulate if he because the I want, you
[47:19] know, a child just doesn't want what's
[47:21] right for itself. a child
[47:24] wants. And if that that thing is never
[47:28] dealt with as a as a two-year-old, it it
[47:31] can become very
[47:33] horrifying at 40 years old. You
[47:36] understand what I'm saying? That's why
[47:37] we got prisons. That's why we've got all
[47:39] the things going on that we
[47:42] do. So, we need to get born again.
[47:44] Ephesians 2:12 says that at that time ye
[47:47] were without Christ being aliens from
[47:49] the commonwealth of Israel and strangers
[47:51] from the covenant of prophets having no
[47:53] hope and without God in the world. Now
[47:56] this is where we were when God came to
[48:01] us. We were
[48:05] aliens even though we were in the mind
[48:07] of
[48:08] God because of the being born in sin. We
[48:13] didn't know about God. We didn't care
[48:14] about God. We didn't really want nothing
[48:16] to do with God. And sometimes we find
[48:18] our nature still not wanting to
[48:23] pray. Christ was in the world and the
[48:25] world was made by him and the world knew
[48:27] him not. He the Bible says he even came
[48:31] unto his own but his own received him
[48:33] not. There was a a distinct separation
[48:36] between us who were in the mind of God.
[48:39] And when we came into the world that God
[48:41] created, we weren't even thinking about
[48:43] God. We were selfish and just wanted our
[48:44] own
[48:46] will. Ephesians 2:3 says, "Among whom
[48:49] also we had our conversations in the
[48:51] time past of our flesh, fulfilling the
[48:53] desires of the flesh and the mind were
[48:55] by nature the children of what?
[48:57] Wrath." You ever get upset at
[49:03] somebody? Children of wrath. But
[49:07] God, amen. But God who is rich in mercy
[49:12] for his great love wherewith he loved
[49:15] us. Consider how great a God that we
[49:19] serve. Consider what he's done for us.
[49:22] Consider the mercy that has rewrote our
[49:25] life and the and the love that he's
[49:27] loved us with. Even when we were dead in
[49:30] sins, he's quickened us together with
[49:32] Christ. By grace are you
[49:34] saved. You know, I think every day we
[49:37] should wake up and say, "Thank you,
[49:38] Lord, for salvation."
[49:40] I really
[49:41] do instead of just I'm
[49:47] saved cuz I got scripture. You want
[49:49] scripture? Today is the day of
[49:50] salvation. There's the scripture for
[49:52] you. I think we need to thank God for
[49:54] salvation every day.
[49:57] Consider with
[49:58] me where were you where would you be
[50:01] today if God had not reached down his
[50:02] hand to you? Where would you be
[50:06] today? I know where I was before I was
[50:10] with God. And just imagine continuing on
[50:13] that cycle where you would be
[50:16] today. It would not be a pretty
[50:20] sight. But consider the riches of God's
[50:23] mercy
[50:24] today. Consider his marvelous and
[50:26] amazing grace. Consider the greatness of
[50:29] God's love in your life
[50:31] today. Because this is personally to
[50:34] you. I can't make Luke consider
[50:39] me. I can't make James consider the
[50:44] Lord. But I myself can make a decision
[50:46] to consider God in my life. And I'll say
[50:50] this is an individual affair that that
[50:52] we need to be willing to consider God in
[50:55] our life.
[50:57] Jesus said in John 3:16, "For God so
[50:59] loved the world that he gave his only
[51:01] begotten son that whosoever
[51:05] believeth." It's it's for us
[51:07] individually. There are some people who
[51:09] just don't care.
[51:12] But I say to the bride, consider how
[51:14] great a things God has done for you.
[51:17] Consider it.
[51:20] And I'll say, the more we can consider
[51:21] what God's doing, the more our faith is
[51:23] going to grow. The more we listen to the
[51:25] enemy and the negativity and and wanting
[51:28] more and just bothered about things all
[51:30] the time, the less our faith it it
[51:33] becomes. It just shrinks. It's like a
[51:36] muscle. Pretty soon we become so weak
[51:38] that we can't even have confidence that
[51:40] even God is walking with us.
[51:43] Jesus said in John 6:37, "All that the
[51:48] Father giveth me shall come to me."
[51:52] All, not most, but
[51:55] all. And him that cometh to me, look it,
[51:59] I will in no wise cast out. Alls we have
[52:04] to do is come to the father.
[52:07] Come to Jesus. Come with our heart. And
[52:11] he's not going to say
[52:13] no. But we've got to be willing to come
[52:17] to God.
[52:19] We we we've heard the story. You can
[52:22] lead a horse to water, but you can't
[52:23] make him drink.
[52:27] We're here in church, but we still need
[52:29] to drink the word. We still need to say,
[52:30] "I'm coming, Lord."
[52:34] Verse 38, "For I came down from heaven,
[52:38] not to do my own will, but to but the
[52:42] will of him that sent me. And this is
[52:44] the father's will which have sent me
[52:47] that that of all which he have given me
[52:51] I should lose nothing. Amen. But should
[52:55] raise him again in the last day.
[52:57] Consider how great our God is. He's not
[53:00] going to lose a one of us here. He's not
[53:02] going to lose a I don't care how we
[53:04] feel. He's not going to lose us. It is
[53:07] impossible for God to lose one of his
[53:09] own.
[53:12] Out of the hundreds and hundreds of
[53:13] people that are around you in your life,
[53:16] think about all the people that are in
[53:17] your
[53:19] life, how many of them are in the
[53:24] message? So I want to tell you this, how
[53:26] many has God really
[53:29] chosen? But yet he brought you the
[53:32] marvelous light.
[53:35] 1 Peter chapter 2:9 says, "But you are
[53:38] you are a chosen generation, a royal
[53:41] priesthood, a holy nation, a peculiar
[53:44] people that you should show forth the
[53:46] praises of him that have called you out
[53:48] of darkness into his marvelous." So God
[53:50] chose you to praise him today. Amen.
[53:53] That means when you're sitting here
[53:54] reading that scripture, you don't just
[53:56] read the scripture, but you actually
[53:58] praise him.
[54:01] Praise the Lord. He's worthy to be
[54:03] praised because he brought you into the
[54:05] light of the word. Amen.
[54:08] You know, Jesus looked at the Pharisees
[54:10] and he said, um, he says, "You love
[54:14] darkness rather than
[54:17] light, but today we're lovers of
[54:19] light. We're lovers of the
[54:22] truth." And you know, Brother Brandham
[54:25] said it like this.
[54:27] If you do not walk in the light that God
[54:30] gives you, he is not obligated to give
[54:33] you anymore,
[54:36] which should provoke us to love the
[54:39] light that he has given us, to worship
[54:42] the word that he has given us. Even
[54:45] though it cuts us, it it it doesn't feel
[54:48] maybe good. We don't want to do it. But
[54:51] if we don't do it, we're cutting ourself
[54:53] off from God because God said, "I'll
[54:55] never leave you and I'll never forsake
[54:58] you." We're the only ones that can leave
[55:01] God. We're the only ones that can
[55:02] forsake
[55:04] God. So consider how great a things God
[55:08] has done for
[55:11] you. Verse 10, I think, let me finish
[55:14] that verse. for which in times past you
[55:16] were not a people but are but are now
[55:19] the people of God which have not
[55:21] obtained mercy but now have obtained
[55:26] mercy. Think about today where would you
[55:28] be without the mercies of
[55:33] God? If you had mercy every single day
[55:36] of your life in the past today you did
[55:40] not have mercy. Where would we be right
[55:45] now? We need God's mercy every day.
[55:49] Every day we need God's mer. So consider
[55:51] how great God is to give us mercy. And
[55:54] look at there. God's got mercy for
[55:55] everybody. He's got grace for everybody
[55:57] in the world. But the only thing is the
[55:58] world is
[55:59] blind to God's mercy. Blind to his
[56:03] grace. They're not even asking for
[56:06] it. And they're they're living in a
[56:08] world without God.
[56:11] They know not God. They know not the
[56:13] mercies of God. Or they take God for
[56:17] granted. Deuteronomy 7:6. We've read
[56:20] this before, but it it bears
[56:23] repeating. For thou art a holy people
[56:25] unto the Lord thy God. The Lord thy God
[56:27] have chosen thee to be a special people
[56:29] unto him above
[56:32] all that are upon the face of the earth.
[56:34] Think about this. You talk about a super
[56:36] race. You talk about You think you're
[56:38] something special. Well, I am. I am
[56:43] special. I'm not special because I think
[56:45] I'm special. I'm special because the
[56:47] word tells me I'm special. There's a big
[56:51] difference. I don't got a big head about
[56:52] it. I just got a big heart about
[56:55] it. The Lord did not set his love upon
[56:58] you nor choose you because you were more
[57:00] in number than the than any people. For
[57:03] you were the fewest of all people. Now,
[57:05] think about it. Of all the people that
[57:07] you know of in your in your in your
[57:11] family, in your friends, in your circle,
[57:14] how many of them are in the
[57:17] message? When you look at this message
[57:19] compared to the denominations, you are
[57:22] the fewest among the
[57:26] people. Israel, the smallest country,
[57:29] smallest
[57:32] people, but yet God chose them. Amen.
[57:35] And God has chosen
[57:37] us. Consider how great a God that we
[57:42] serve. We could be out in the world or
[57:46] out in some
[57:48] denomination or out without some sort of
[57:53] understanding. But God chose us because
[57:56] he loves
[57:57] us. Consider how great God is. St. John
[58:00] 10:28 says, "And I give unto them
[58:02] eternal life, and they shall never
[58:04] perish, neither shall any man pluck them
[58:07] out of my hand."
[58:09] Think about the people that have done
[58:11] you
[58:13] harm. Think about the devil who wants to
[58:15] attack
[58:17] you. I give unto them eternal life, and
[58:20] they shall never perish, neither shall
[58:23] any man pluck them out of my hand.
[58:27] Right? That's what Jesus said. Amen.
[58:30] Verse 29. My father which is greater
[58:33] than even
[58:35] me is greater than all. I'm sorry. My
[58:38] father which gave me is greater than
[58:40] all. And no man is able to pluck them
[58:42] out of my father's hand. So what is he
[58:45] really saying? My hand and the father's
[58:47] hand is the same. Amen. Look at verse
[58:50] 30. I and my father are one. No human
[58:54] being can separate us from the love of
[58:56] God. He chose us and that settles it.
[59:01] God said
[59:02] it going to change. God will not lose a
[59:06] one. Amen. I think what we should do is
[59:09] just tell the devil to get behind me.
[59:11] I'm done with you. I'm done listening to
[59:13] you.
[59:15] I don't have to bow down to you anymore.
[59:17] I don't have to do what this flesh wants
[59:20] to do anymore.
[59:22] Consider how great things God has done
[59:25] for us.
[59:27] Consider your security with
[59:29] God. If God be before us, who can be
[59:32] against
[59:33] us? Who shall lay anything to the charge
[59:35] of God's elect? Who shall separate us
[59:38] from the love of God? Consider your
[59:41] security with God.
[59:44] Paul said in Romans 8:3, for I'm
[59:46] persuaded that neither life nor neither
[59:48] death nor life, nor angels,
[59:50] principalities, powers, nor things that
[59:52] are present happening in our life, nor
[59:54] things that are even to come in our
[59:56] life, nor height, nor death, nor any
[59:58] other creature shall be able to separate
[59:59] us from the love of God, which is in
[1:00:04] Christ Jesus our Lord.
[1:00:08] So where where would we want to be for
[1:00:11] security right now? is is is security
[1:00:15] having like
[1:00:18] $3
[1:00:19] million, right? Having all of our bills
[1:00:22] paid, having the best
[1:00:25] spouse, best friends, the best
[1:00:30] following. If there's one thing we
[1:00:32] should be pursuing is falling in love
[1:00:34] with Jesus Christ.
[1:00:36] Pursue it. And don't make God do all the
[1:00:40] work. Yeah. I I I tell you, I hate
[1:00:41] relationships where the other
[1:00:44] person does nothing and you got to do
[1:00:47] everything for the
[1:00:49] relationship. Hate those kind of
[1:00:51] relationships. And no wonders Jesus
[1:00:53] said, "All that ever come before me are
[1:00:55] thieves and
[1:00:56] robbers. They just want
[1:01:02] want us that nothing can separate us
[1:01:05] from the love of God.
[1:01:07] Alls we need is to heal. Receive God's
[1:01:11] love into our heart and project it back
[1:01:13] to him.
[1:01:16] Don't just receive it and do nothing
[1:01:18] with it. But if you love me, keep my
[1:01:20] commandments. Project it back. Be
[1:01:23] interested in doing the things that God
[1:01:25] wants you to do. That really is the
[1:01:27] proof whether you love God or not.
[1:01:30] Everybody has feelings that I I love
[1:01:32] God, but it needs to be proved.
[1:01:36] I mean, no, you husbands, I can tell you
[1:01:39] this right now. None of you
[1:01:41] husbands would say to your wives, if
[1:01:44] it's, "Please don't prove you love me
[1:01:48] anymore. You can stop proving it. I know
[1:01:51] you love me now. Stop proving me." And I
[1:01:54] know you wives would never look at your
[1:01:55] husband and say, "I know you told me you
[1:01:57] love me when we got married, but would
[1:01:59] you just stop trying to prove it to me
[1:02:01] now?"
[1:02:04] No, we want to feel that
[1:02:07] expression. We want to feel love
[1:02:09] projected. We want to and and our
[1:02:11] spouses want love to be
[1:02:14] projected. It's no different with God.
[1:02:17] God God's not sitting up there and, you
[1:02:19] know, with this attitude, I just want to
[1:02:21] brew over the people and love them, but
[1:02:23] I don't want them to love me back.
[1:02:26] No, he actually wants us to worship him,
[1:02:29] to bow before him, to consider how great
[1:02:31] he is. And to say, God, thank you for
[1:02:34] every blessing. Thank you for meet my
[1:02:36] needs. Thank you for the breath of life.
[1:02:37] Thank you for my shoes. Thank you for my
[1:02:39] car. Thank you for my food. Thank you
[1:02:41] for my health. Thank you that things are
[1:02:42] not as bad as they could be.
[1:02:46] instead of just waking up
[1:02:48] with
[1:02:50] assuming
[1:02:53] that. I tell you, if you don't fill your
[1:02:55] mind with thanksgiving, it will be
[1:02:57] filled with
[1:02:59] complaining. It's one or two spirits.
[1:03:02] It's one or the
[1:03:04] other. Consider how great God
[1:03:09] is. Because we were in the mind of God
[1:03:12] before the foundation of the world, he
[1:03:14] predestinated us to be even here in the
[1:03:16] service
[1:03:18] today. Romans 8:29 says, "For whom he
[1:03:21] did for no, he also did predestinate to
[1:03:24] be conformed to the image of his son
[1:03:26] that he might be the firstborn of men
[1:03:28] many brethren." So before there was a
[1:03:32] world by his
[1:03:36] fornowledge he said
[1:03:38] there I I I see Charlie
[1:03:43] Neyma before the foundation of the world
[1:03:46] I see Stan
[1:03:47] Ferguson I see Bruce
[1:03:50] Jacowski I
[1:03:52] see okay my sisters I don't want to
[1:03:55] leave you out he's seen every one of
[1:03:58] us And because he saw us and he chose us
[1:04:04] through
[1:04:05] fornowledge by his choosing, he now
[1:04:08] could predestinate
[1:04:11] us because this is what's going to
[1:04:14] happen to
[1:04:16] them. I know that they're going to
[1:04:19] reciprocate love back. I know they're
[1:04:21] going to take my word when I give them
[1:04:23] my word. They're going to walk in the
[1:04:25] light when I give them the light. I know
[1:04:27] what's going to happen
[1:04:29] because I I saw it. I saw it at the
[1:04:34] beginning. Therefore, I have
[1:04:35] predestinated this is going to be the
[1:04:37] end of them. They're going to make a
[1:04:39] rapture. They're going to go in a
[1:04:40] rapture. They're going to receive the
[1:04:41] message of the hour. They're going to
[1:04:43] receive the word what it takes to make
[1:04:44] it
[1:04:46] in. Verse 30. Moreover, whom he did
[1:04:49] predestinate, them he also called.
[1:04:53] And to whom he
[1:04:54] called, he's also
[1:04:56] justified. And to whom he's justified,
[1:04:59] them he's also glorified. I think we
[1:05:02] need to consider how greater God is. I
[1:05:05] think we need to consider it.
[1:05:07] I mean, if I gave
[1:05:11] you the task of making
[1:05:15] sure that
[1:05:17] Monday turns out
[1:05:20] absolutely beautiful and
[1:05:25] perfect, would you be able to do
[1:05:28] it? No.
[1:05:31] No matter how much you desire in your
[1:05:33] heart to want your day to go perfect,
[1:05:37] you don't have the control to do it. You
[1:05:41] don't have the power to do it. But you
[1:05:43] know God
[1:05:45] does. But God
[1:05:48] does. Consider how great our God is. Our
[1:05:52] God is so great that he makes all things
[1:05:53] work together for the good. Right? To
[1:05:56] them that love and to them that are
[1:05:58] called according to not our purpose but
[1:06:01] his purpose.
[1:06:05] So even when we make mistakes, we need
[1:06:08] to consider how great our God
[1:06:10] is. Has anybody made a mistake? When's
[1:06:14] the last time you made a mistake? How
[1:06:15] many's made a mistake before you got to
[1:06:16] church
[1:06:19] today? How many's ever sat in church
[1:06:21] with the attitude of I just don't feel
[1:06:23] like being here?
[1:06:25] I want to see you after
[1:06:31] church. But God is there for us when we
[1:06:34] make mistakes. First John 2:1 says, "My
[1:06:36] little children, these things have I
[1:06:38] these things I write unto you that you
[1:06:40] sin
[1:06:41] not. And if any man sin, we have an
[1:06:45] advocate with the father." Amen. Jesus
[1:06:48] Christ the righteous. We have someone.
[1:06:52] Consider how great God is.
[1:06:56] He doesn't expect us to be
[1:06:58] perfect, but he does expect us to do our
[1:07:03] very, very best because God does his
[1:07:06] very best for us. He never comes to us
[1:07:08] and says, you know, I don't feel like
[1:07:09] forgiving you today. He doesn't have
[1:07:12] that
[1:07:14] attitude. He's he's a he's he perfectly
[1:07:17] loves us.
[1:07:19] Perfectly loves us.
[1:07:24] Verse two, and he is the propitiation
[1:07:28] for our sins and not ours only, but also
[1:07:33] for the sins of the whole world. In
[1:07:35] other words, God would do the same for
[1:07:37] the whole world as he's done for you if
[1:07:39] they would just simply repent and say,
[1:07:42] "I'm sorry."
[1:07:46] God's got power to forgive the whole
[1:07:48] world. Amen.
[1:07:50] Look at how great a thing God did for
[1:07:52] Jonah in the belly of a fish. Jonah 2:7.
[1:07:56] When my soul fainted within me, I
[1:07:59] remembered. I
[1:08:01] considered the Lord and my prayer came
[1:08:04] in unto thee into thy holy temple. So
[1:08:07] Jonah was considering how great God was
[1:08:10] at in the midst of his calamity. And in
[1:08:12] verse two, he said, I cried by reason of
[1:08:15] in my affliction unto the Lord. And he
[1:08:17] heard me and out of the belly of hell,
[1:08:19] he called it hell. What a
[1:08:21] description. Cried I, and thou heardest
[1:08:24] my voice. Amen. Verse eight, they that
[1:08:27] observe lying vanities forsake their own
[1:08:31] mercy. God has mercy for us today.
[1:08:35] Don't Don't keep looking at your
[1:08:37] problems.
[1:08:39] You might be thinking, I got a problem
[1:08:41] with my child. You child, you may be
[1:08:42] thinking, I got a problem with my
[1:08:43] parent. Don't look at
[1:08:46] that. Don't look at the problem. Look at
[1:08:49] what God has to remedy the problem.
[1:08:51] Amen. So they that observe lying for
[1:08:55] vanities forsake their own mercies.
[1:08:57] Verse nine. And I will sacrifice unto
[1:08:59] thee with the voice of thanksgiving. I
[1:09:02] will pay that uh that I have vowed.
[1:09:06] Salvation is of the Lord. Amen.
[1:09:11] And the Lord spake unto the fish, and it
[1:09:13] vomited out Jonah on upon the dry land.
[1:09:17] I mean, everybody's vomited at one time
[1:09:19] or another. And it's just something you
[1:09:21] don't feel like
[1:09:22] doing. Can you imagine being in the
[1:09:25] vomit? But I'll say this is probably the
[1:09:28] most joyful time that he had after being
[1:09:32] in his
[1:09:33] situation was he because he when you
[1:09:35] when he got when he was vomiting, he was
[1:09:37] coming out of the situation.
[1:09:42] So, I just want to say this that at one
[1:09:45] time or another, we made a decision we
[1:09:47] were going to serve
[1:09:49] God, right? We went, we we got baptized.
[1:09:52] I'm going to serve God. I'm going to put
[1:09:53] him first. Sometimes along the way, we
[1:09:56] can stop
[1:09:59] trying. God still wants us to follow
[1:10:02] through with what we said we wanted to
[1:10:04] do. and and and and God wanted Jonah to
[1:10:09] go to
[1:10:10] Nineveh. And Jonah wanted
[1:10:13] to fulfill
[1:10:15] that. And I believe we just need to
[1:10:19] consider the things that God has done in
[1:10:23] our life. We look back, we can see
[1:10:24] Jonah, what he did for Jonah. We can see
[1:10:26] what he did for for non. We can see what
[1:10:29] God is he did for the the woman at the
[1:10:31] well. uh the the centurion, the woman
[1:10:34] with the blood issue, what he what he
[1:10:36] did for the the three Hebrew children
[1:10:38] for David in the lion's den or Daniel in
[1:10:40] the lion's den and David and Goliath.
[1:10:42] When we consider how great our God is,
[1:10:45] I'm telling you, all those things are
[1:10:47] natural things, but they're spiritually
[1:10:49] happening in our lives. And we need to
[1:10:51] consider how many times God's got us out
[1:10:53] of the furnace.
[1:10:56] You know how how many times has he I say
[1:10:58] we all could raise our hands here. How
[1:11:00] many's been healed before?
[1:11:03] Look at
[1:11:04] that. What a
[1:11:07] testimony. That's enough to make us
[1:11:10] never doubt that he's going to heal us.
[1:11:12] That testimony right there that you just
[1:11:14] gave. Amen. Because God is faithful.
[1:11:17] What he's done before, he can do it
[1:11:19] again. Amen. So consider the mercy of
[1:11:22] God in our own lives. We just saw it in
[1:11:25] Jonah. Consider it in our own life. We
[1:11:27] sing the song, mercy rewrote my life.
[1:11:30] Lamentations 3:20 says, "My soul have
[1:11:34] them still in remembrance and is humbled
[1:11:37] in
[1:11:38] me." This I recall to my mind. Therefore
[1:11:42] have I hope. It is of the Lord's
[1:11:46] mercy that we are not
[1:11:49] consumed. It's the truth.
[1:11:54] every single day. Brother Bram said back
[1:11:56] in the day, I don't know what year he
[1:11:57] said it was, but it it was a many years
[1:11:59] ago, we backslide 100 times a
[1:12:02] day. It is of the Lord's mercy that we
[1:12:05] are not consumed because his compassion
[1:12:08] faileth not, and they are new every
[1:12:11] morning. Great is thy faithfulness. I
[1:12:13] remember the time that brother Brandham
[1:12:15] uh uh walked was walked into a bar or
[1:12:20] some sort of restaurant with a bar in.
[1:12:22] can't remember quite what it was to get
[1:12:23] a burger. And and when he walked in, he
[1:12:26] saw just nothing but filth in this
[1:12:30] place. The way they were acting, their
[1:12:32] behavior, their drinking, they're
[1:12:34] smoking, they're cussing, all that they
[1:12:38] were
[1:12:39] doing. And and and God and brother
[1:12:41] Brandon says, "God, why don't you just
[1:12:43] destroy this place?" Because he walked
[1:12:45] into such evil, right?
[1:12:49] And God had to show brother Brandham
[1:12:51] that if it wasn't for God's mercies, he
[1:12:54] would be consumed.
[1:13:00] So in other words, you can't compare
[1:13:02] yourself with somebody that's worse than
[1:13:04] you.
[1:13:05] That's just a trick to make you feel
[1:13:07] better.
[1:13:11] We all need the blood of Jesus Christ to
[1:13:14] cover us on a regular daily basis. plead
[1:13:17] the blood. Apply the token because it's
[1:13:20] that blood that forgives us. If we sit
[1:13:22] around, if alls I'm going to do is look
[1:13:24] at somebody in the world, how much worse
[1:13:26] they are than me, just so I can feel
[1:13:28] better, I'm still going to be consumed.
[1:13:30] I'm still going to die. I'm still going
[1:13:31] to be without Christ, I need the blood
[1:13:33] of Christ just as much as anybody else
[1:13:35] does.
[1:13:38] I love the scripture. 1 John
[1:13:40] 1:9. 1 John 1:9. If we confess our
[1:13:44] sins, he is faithful and just to forgive
[1:13:46] us of our sins and to cleanse us from
[1:13:50] all
[1:13:52] unrighteousness. All of it. Consider
[1:13:55] God's forgiveness in your life. Consider
[1:13:58] his mercy. Consider how great things
[1:14:00] that God has done. When we when we fall,
[1:14:03] we sin, we backslide, we make mistakes,
[1:14:07] we come short of his glory.
[1:14:13] It can whittle away at our virtue, at
[1:14:15] our strength, our self-esteem. It can
[1:14:19] break us down to the point of just
[1:14:21] feeling so
[1:14:24] weak. But
[1:14:26] God wants us to remember that he cares
[1:14:30] for
[1:14:32] us and that we need to believe in him.
[1:14:34] just
[1:14:35] believe because it's that one factor
[1:14:40] that brings God on the
[1:14:42] scene. First Peter 15 says, "We are kept
[1:14:45] by the power of God through faith unto
[1:14:50] salvation, ready to be revealed in the
[1:14:53] last time. We are kept by the power of
[1:14:56] God." It is the power of God. We we
[1:14:59] today we have the keeping power of the
[1:15:02] Holy Ghost. Amen.
[1:15:06] But we have that through faith. We get
[1:15:08] up in the morning and we know that we
[1:15:10] got the Holy Ghost and it keeps us. We
[1:15:12] don't have to get up in the morning and
[1:15:14] wonder if God is going to be with us.
[1:15:17] We are kept by the power of God through
[1:15:21] faith. It's a
[1:15:23] power. But we got to believe. We got to
[1:15:26] exercise our
[1:15:29] faith. And faith cometh by hearing and
[1:15:32] hearing by the word. That's why we don't
[1:15:33] want to we don't want to sit in church
[1:15:35] and have our mind go somewhere else. We
[1:15:37] want to sit in church and we want to
[1:15:39] hear the word that God is speaking
[1:15:41] directly to. Imagine just for a moment,
[1:15:43] every one of us here, imagine you are
[1:15:46] the only person sitting in church today
[1:15:48] and everybody else is
[1:15:50] gone. That's how you want to listen to
[1:15:52] the word.
[1:15:54] That's God speaking to you
[1:15:57] directly. Isaiah 40 28. Has thou not
[1:16:01] known? Is thou not heard? That the
[1:16:03] everlasting God, the Lord, the creator
[1:16:05] of the ends of the earth, he faintth
[1:16:07] not, neither is he weary? There's no
[1:16:10] searching of his understanding. He
[1:16:12] giveth power to who? The
[1:16:15] faint, no matter what condition. To them
[1:16:19] that have no might. He actually gives
[1:16:21] them strength.
[1:16:24] Even the youth shall faint and be
[1:16:28] weary, and the young men shall utterly
[1:16:31] fall. But they that wait upon the Lord
[1:16:34] shall renew their strength. They shall
[1:16:37] mount up with wings as eagles. They
[1:16:38] shall run and not be weary. They shall
[1:16:41] walk and not faint. Amen.
[1:16:45] Praise God that he has given us an
[1:16:47] avenue to get strength.
[1:16:50] We don't have to just wonder how can I
[1:16:52] get strong. All we have to do is spend
[1:16:54] some time with Jesus.
[1:16:57] Spend some time with
[1:16:59] him. Consider how great things he has
[1:17:02] done. I mean, there's I I I know you've
[1:17:05] heard me tell the story one time that I
[1:17:07] I I got beat up so bad and taught behind
[1:17:12] my back so bad to a person that I
[1:17:15] literally gave years and
[1:17:17] years of
[1:17:20] faithful love to.
[1:17:25] And uh the man was just trying to
[1:17:29] destroy me and and and and and discredit
[1:17:32] me and
[1:17:35] lie. And I I remember going
[1:17:40] home, going to the house and going into
[1:17:44] our one room with the piano and the
[1:17:47] couch there. And I remember just
[1:17:49] kneeling down and saying, "God, I need
[1:17:53] you.
[1:17:56] I didn't accept any ill thoughts about
[1:17:58] the
[1:17:59] person, but the devil was making a
[1:18:01] heyday coming at
[1:18:07] me. Just said, "Lord, help
[1:18:11] me." I put the responsibility on me.
[1:18:16] I
[1:18:17] didn't ask
[1:18:20] God to judge that man, to punish that
[1:18:23] man, to hurt that man, or straighten
[1:18:24] that man
[1:18:26] out. I just said, "God, help me. Come
[1:18:29] into my heart. I need you." And I'll
[1:18:32] tell you, that's all it took. And the
[1:18:35] presence of God came so strong. The love
[1:18:37] of God filled my heart so strong, I did
[1:18:40] not even think about anything he did to
[1:18:41] me negatively.
[1:18:43] That was the power of God. They that
[1:18:46] wait upon the Lord. It's not how long
[1:18:48] you wait upon him. It's just where
[1:18:50] you're at.
[1:18:53] But he's there wanting to meet every
[1:18:55] need that we could possibly have.
[1:18:58] Consider how great a God that we serve
[1:19:02] today. We serve a mighty God. He giveth
[1:19:05] power to the faint. He increasth
[1:19:08] strength. We are kept by the power of
[1:19:10] God through se uh through faith unto
[1:19:13] salvation. God has power for
[1:19:16] us. You know, when we have the power of
[1:19:18] God, you don't need to manipulate
[1:19:21] anything. You don't need you you don't
[1:19:23] fear anything. You're not worried about
[1:19:25] anything. You don't need to go behind
[1:19:27] the scenes and kind of, you know, tell
[1:19:29] this person that person and control this
[1:19:31] to get that. You don't have to do that.
[1:19:33] When you got God, you got everything.
[1:19:36] You know the song, if I got Jesus, I got
[1:19:39] it all.
[1:19:40] All you need. Speaking of the spirits
[1:19:42] now, 1 John 4:4, "Ye are of God, little
[1:19:46] children, and have overcome them because
[1:19:47] greater is he that is in you than he
[1:19:50] that's in the world." Speaking of the
[1:19:52] spirits now, greater is the spirit
[1:19:55] that's in you than the spirit that's of
[1:19:58] the world. Right. And the spirit of the
[1:20:00] world speaks to our
[1:20:03] head, tries to confuse us and bring us
[1:20:05] down and and get us away from our
[1:20:08] security, get us away from our
[1:20:10] protection, our shield, to get us away
[1:20:12] from following the word, getting us to
[1:20:17] compromise, but greater is he that's in
[1:20:20] you. You know, it would be
[1:20:23] nice. It would be nice, J. Uh, Luke,
[1:20:26] don't you think it would be nice if
[1:20:27] everybody in the church here was so
[1:20:29] filled with the Holy Ghost that they
[1:20:32] never did one bad thing? Wouldn't that
[1:20:35] be awesome? That'd be
[1:20:37] awesome. Wouldn't it be great if if
[1:20:42] if everybody all your friends were
[1:20:46] always sharing and
[1:20:48] giving, always saying nice things.
[1:20:51] Mom, wouldn't it be nice if all the kids
[1:20:54] never disobeyed you, disrespected you,
[1:20:57] and said, "Mom, you give me these chores
[1:20:59] to do, I'm going to do them, and what
[1:21:02] more would you like me to
[1:21:05] do?" Wouldn't you like it that you would
[1:21:08] always have dinner on time, and mom and
[1:21:11] dad would always say, "You're just the
[1:21:13] best thing since sliced bread." And that
[1:21:16] they never did anything wrong. Wouldn't
[1:21:19] that be like the ideal
[1:21:22] thing? Wouldn't it be the ideal thing to
[1:21:26] to have a wife that always cooked dinner
[1:21:28] and you never had to cook
[1:21:33] it? I mean, we all could say things
[1:21:36] would be better if my spouse was
[1:21:40] better. But you know, if you have
[1:21:43] Jesus, you can deal with anything.
[1:21:47] Amen. Because greater is he that's in
[1:21:50] you than he that's in the
[1:21:52] world. That's all we need. We don't need
[1:21:55] to focus. I don't need to focus on
[1:21:56] getting an better and don't need to
[1:21:59] focus on getting me better. We just need
[1:22:02] to both focus on getting more of the
[1:22:04] Holy Ghost.
[1:22:06] Because then I know how to help an knows
[1:22:09] how to help
[1:22:10] me because we got the God who knows all
[1:22:13] things living inside of us. Right?
[1:22:17] The scriptures saying greater is he. Can
[1:22:19] we just f just take a moment and
[1:22:22] consider how great God
[1:22:25] is. God is so great that he can meet
[1:22:28] every
[1:22:30] need. My God shall supply all of your
[1:22:32] needs according to his riches and glory.
[1:22:35] I can do all things through Christ who
[1:22:37] strengthenth me.
[1:22:39] Is God in us the hope of glory?
[1:22:42] It's not hope in
[1:22:45] my my family member the hope of
[1:22:49] glory. I'll tell you that family member
[1:22:52] never may never come in. Come on. I hate
[1:22:56] to say
[1:22:58] it. I I got some of my children serving
[1:23:01] the Lord. I got some that are
[1:23:05] not. I I'm I'm not going to sit around
[1:23:08] waiting.
[1:23:11] It's the grace of God that he has showed
[1:23:14] me what he showed me in his
[1:23:16] word. And it it's not for
[1:23:19] everybody. It's
[1:23:21] not. But if he has shown you what to do,
[1:23:24] walk in it. Walk in it. Because he's got
[1:23:28] more for you. He is bringing you up to
[1:23:30] the statue of a perfect man. You are his
[1:23:33] bride. You're not a a a foolish virgin.
[1:23:37] You're not just somebody who's going to
[1:23:38] go through tribulation. You are going to
[1:23:40] get caught up. You got to believe that.
[1:23:42] You got to confess it. You got to walk
[1:23:44] in it. You got to come to church
[1:23:47] expecting you're going to hear the word
[1:23:48] that's going to get you up higher.
[1:23:51] You You can't allow yourself to
[1:23:55] just be lukewarm.
[1:24:01] Joshua said, or God said to Joshua,
[1:24:03] "There shall not be any man be able to
[1:24:06] stand before thee all the days of thy
[1:24:08] life. As I was with Moses, so I will be
[1:24:10] with thee. I will not fail thee, nor
[1:24:13] forsake thee." Oh, give me Jesus.
[1:24:18] That that right there, I don't need
[1:24:20] anybody to be walking with me. I don't
[1:24:21] need anybody to follow me. I don't need
[1:24:23] anybody to help me. If I got Jesus, what
[1:24:25] else do I need?
[1:24:28] Consider how great things God has done
[1:24:30] for you. I mean, everybody would have
[1:24:33] liked to be in Joshua's shoes when God
[1:24:35] said that to
[1:24:38] Joshua. But this, when you read that,
[1:24:40] this is what God is saying to you. This
[1:24:43] scripture is for
[1:24:48] you. Did you ever need
[1:24:51] joy? Amen. He has joy unspeakable and
[1:24:55] full of glory. It is the fruit of
[1:24:57] Christ. So consider the joy he has given
[1:25:01] you. Have Okay, we've we've all said, "I
[1:25:04] I I've I've needed joy before. I've been
[1:25:06] without joy." How many has had joy
[1:25:08] before? The same people that needs it
[1:25:11] has felt it.
[1:25:14] That's all the testimony we need. We
[1:25:17] know it's real. We know joy is real. We
[1:25:20] know the joy of the Lord is our
[1:25:21] strength. We know the fullness of his
[1:25:23] presence. In his presence is fullness of
[1:25:30] joy. Work for
[1:25:32] it. How do I work for it? Work to get in
[1:25:34] his presence. Labor together in. Worship
[1:25:37] him. Clap your hands. Say, "I love you,
[1:25:39] Jesus." Don't wait till you feel like
[1:25:41] it.
[1:25:43] Don't Don't wait till you get in the
[1:25:44] mood.
[1:25:46] Create the mood.
[1:25:49] create the mood that Jesus comes and
[1:25:51] gives you the desires of your heart.
[1:25:53] Amen.
[1:25:57] Has God supplied and been faithful to
[1:26:00] supply all your natural needs? Yes, he
[1:26:03] he certainly has. Psalms 37:25, I have
[1:26:07] been young and now I'm old, yet have I
[1:26:10] not seen the righteous forsaken, nor his
[1:26:12] seed begging bread. He is ever merciful
[1:26:15] and lendeth and his seed is
[1:26:19] blessed. Can you
[1:26:22] imagine ever feeling like your need is
[1:26:24] not being
[1:26:29] met? You know, the the devil's always
[1:26:32] trying to get us to call God a
[1:26:35] liar, but God is not a liar. I'd rather
[1:26:38] believe the word, what the word says,
[1:26:41] than what I'm going through.
[1:26:43] If I feel like my need isn't being met,
[1:26:46] I'd rather confess what the word says
[1:26:49] because there's a time of test and
[1:26:51] there's a time of trial. I remember very
[1:26:54] early in my walk with God and everybody
[1:26:56] who's really
[1:26:58] um ever serious about God has has gone
[1:27:02] through this
[1:27:03] trial that when you come into the truth
[1:27:06] of the word, you learn about paying
[1:27:09] tithe. And when you first come into it
[1:27:13] and you're being introduced to it, you
[1:27:16] consider, well, I just don't have enough
[1:27:18] money to pay my tithes right
[1:27:21] now. And I will eventually my intent is
[1:27:25] to pay them and and I will pay, you
[1:27:28] know, start paying them when I can when
[1:27:31] I when I feel that the money's there.
[1:27:33] You understand? We've all gone through
[1:27:35] that at one time or another early in our
[1:27:39] our our our walk with God just like a
[1:27:42] number of other things. And the the
[1:27:45] thing is when you get the revelation
[1:27:47] that he's first and you pay him first
[1:27:50] and that your bills and whatever you
[1:27:52] want is after
[1:27:54] that, well then you can learn to see how
[1:27:58] God is faithful to you.
[1:28:00] Because that's when the blessings come
[1:28:02] is when you put him first. Not second,
[1:28:06] but first. Amen.
[1:28:12] Have you ever been confused
[1:28:15] before? Has mom and dad ever said
[1:28:17] something and you said,
[1:28:19] "What?" Or parents, when your kids come
[1:28:22] to you and they say something, have you
[1:28:24] ever looked at them and said,
[1:28:27] "What?"
[1:28:29] Confusion is all around us because the
[1:28:31] devil is the author of
[1:28:33] confusion. And he's he would like
[1:28:36] nothing better than to confuse us. He
[1:28:39] would the devil would probably like
[1:28:40] nothing better if I get up here and just
[1:28:42] start speaking things that are not
[1:28:44] scriptural, to bring a confusion,
[1:28:48] right? Because this is the ultimate.
[1:28:51] This this is the absolute. This is what
[1:28:53] we're all going to be judged by. So, we
[1:28:56] might as well just start with it today
[1:28:57] and stay with it today.
[1:29:00] But we've all been in states of
[1:29:02] confusion, bothered in our mind, looking
[1:29:05] for peace. How many has ever wanted
[1:29:08] peace
[1:29:11] before? We all want
[1:29:13] peace. And we've all been in states
[1:29:15] where um peace wasn't there. But we've
[1:29:19] all always been, not always, but we've
[1:29:21] experienced the peace of God before. And
[1:29:24] the scripture tells us that he has a
[1:29:26] peace that passes understanding. like
[1:29:29] you don't understand why you're going
[1:29:31] through what you're going through, but
[1:29:32] you just feel calm about it. You feel
[1:29:36] settled. And that's what the peace of
[1:29:38] God does. Ephesians 2:13 says, "But now
[1:29:41] in Christ Jesus, he who were aar off are
[1:29:46] made nigh by the blood of Christ, for he
[1:29:50] is our
[1:29:52] peace." He is our peace. Now think about
[1:29:57] the time the situations that you have
[1:29:59] had disruption with another human being
[1:30:03] maybe somebody at work a spouse or a
[1:30:06] neighbor or a family member that you got
[1:30:09] a a problem with and you're thinking
[1:30:11] that this person is got to get it
[1:30:14] together before you can have peace. But
[1:30:17] that is not scriptural. It's not
[1:30:19] scriptural that that person's got to get
[1:30:23] it together and be right before you can
[1:30:25] have peace because he is not your peace.
[1:30:28] It's a slap in the face of God. God is
[1:30:30] our peace. Amen. Let them act the way
[1:30:33] they want. Let them treat you the way
[1:30:35] they want. Let them be the way they
[1:30:36] want. You get your peace from God
[1:30:39] because he is our peace. Not
[1:30:45] sometimes. Remember the Jesus was in the
[1:30:47] boat and he was sleeping and the
[1:30:50] disciples, don't you care about us? The
[1:30:52] storm's going to wake up and take care
[1:30:53] of this
[1:30:54] problem. And what did Jesus say? Peace
[1:30:57] be
[1:31:00] still. He can the first thing I mean if
[1:31:04] we got chaos going on, I mean things
[1:31:07] happen. I mean accidents happening,
[1:31:08] people go to the emergency, bad things
[1:31:11] happen. Life is truly life. But the
[1:31:14] first thing that has to happen is God
[1:31:16] has to come into your mind and give you
[1:31:19] peace. Peace in your mind, peace in your
[1:31:23] heart.
[1:31:24] Because when there's peace, then you can
[1:31:26] start dealing with the situation and
[1:31:28] handling it the right way. He is our
[1:31:31] peace. We don't have to straighten this
[1:31:33] out and say, "Okay, I got peace now."
[1:31:35] That's not how it works. Peace comes
[1:31:37] first, then straighten it out, then
[1:31:40] trust him. He is our peace. Give God
[1:31:44] glory. Let him be the peace of your
[1:31:48] life. Thou will thou will keep him in
[1:31:51] perfect peace whose mind is stayed on
[1:31:56] thee because he trustth ine. Now, one of
[1:31:58] the hardest things I think that we have
[1:32:00] to do is to keep God on our mind. It's
[1:32:03] the hardest thing to do. We got
[1:32:05] problems. We're dealing with problems.
[1:32:06] We're solving problems. Got a whole list
[1:32:08] of things to do. And it's hard to like,
[1:32:11] you know, think of two things at one
[1:32:13] time. So, it's hard to keep God there.
[1:32:16] But I am telling you, if you if you keep
[1:32:19] God there while working on whatever
[1:32:21] you're working on, you will be kept in
[1:32:24] perfect peace.
[1:32:26] Because it's a scripture. You just got
[1:32:28] to believe it and start applying it to
[1:32:30] your life. Jesus said, "These things
[1:32:32] have I spoken unto thee that you might
[1:32:35] have
[1:32:36] peace in the world. You're going to have
[1:32:39] tribulation, Jesus said. But he said,
[1:32:41] "Be of good cheer for I have overcome
[1:32:43] the world." In other words, Jesus had
[1:32:45] peace. Remember when the the whole
[1:32:48] thing, you know, Judas comes up to him
[1:32:50] and betrays him with a kiss. I mean, at
[1:32:53] that point, you you talk about, you
[1:32:56] know, summer's nigh. You you know, it's
[1:32:59] time to go to the cross when that
[1:33:01] happens, right?
[1:33:07] But Jesus didn't, you know, you know,
[1:33:09] put Judas in a
[1:33:11] headlock, punch him in the face and say,
[1:33:13] "What are you trying to
[1:33:15] do? What thou doest do us
[1:33:19] quickly?" Because he settled it in the
[1:33:22] garden. He settled it in the
[1:33:25] garden. Not my will, thy will be done.
[1:33:28] He came to give his life. I tell you, if
[1:33:31] we can just put our trust into to the
[1:33:33] father like Jesus did, right? We'll have
[1:33:37] peace because God has peace for us. Look
[1:33:41] at the three Hebrew children. They
[1:33:43] weren't
[1:33:44] franicking. They weren't saying, "Oh,
[1:33:47] you know, just, you know, let's think
[1:33:48] this over. We need to have a serious
[1:33:50] prayer meeting." They made their
[1:33:52] decision. I don't know what's going to
[1:33:54] happen in there when we go in there, but
[1:33:56] I do know this. We're not bowing down
[1:33:58] before you. It's settled. I have peace
[1:34:00] in my heart. I'm going to go through the
[1:34:02] trial that I got to go through. I'm not
[1:34:03] going to give up God. I'm not going to
[1:34:05] give up peace. I'm not going to give up
[1:34:06] the word. I'm going to be faithful. I'm
[1:34:08] going to go to church. I'm going to pay
[1:34:09] my tithe. I'm going to serve him every
[1:34:10] day. I'm going to serve him in my home.
[1:34:12] I'm going to serve my children. I'm
[1:34:13] going to bring them up in the fear of
[1:34:14] the Lord. I am going to stay with the
[1:34:16] word. That's when peace comes. When you
[1:34:19] put God first, peace comes. God split
[1:34:22] the Red
[1:34:25] Sea. Consider how great God is.
[1:34:29] We all have Red Sea
[1:34:32] experiences. We've all God has just
[1:34:35] brought us out of si situations and it
[1:34:37] was by the grace of God we look back and
[1:34:39] we say, "God, I don't know how you did
[1:34:42] it, but you did
[1:34:43] it." And then he
[1:34:46] literally killed your enemy behind you.
[1:34:49] Just destroyed
[1:34:51] him. We've all had red sea experiences.
[1:34:55] every one of us
[1:34:57] here. Now, I'm not saying we don't still
[1:34:59] have giants in the pro in the promised
[1:35:01] land. We do. We still have things to
[1:35:03] deal
[1:35:05] with. But we don't want to murmur about
[1:35:08] the problems that we got today. We know
[1:35:10] what happens when we do that. We get
[1:35:12] left in the wilderness. But what we need
[1:35:14] to do is consider how great our God was
[1:35:17] that he brought us through the Red Sea,
[1:35:19] brought us through the experiences,
[1:35:21] brought us through the things that he's
[1:35:22] delivered us. I can tell you that there
[1:35:24] were things in my
[1:35:27] life that when I had my Red Sea
[1:35:29] experience, they've never come
[1:35:33] back. I I know that I know that I know
[1:35:36] they killed the enemy got
[1:35:39] destroyed and I've been free of that
[1:35:43] thing. But but you do understand if my
[1:35:46] name can be in the book of life, I can
[1:35:48] be saved and then God can take it away
[1:35:50] from me.
[1:35:52] That means I can I can I can be
[1:35:55] entangled again with the things of the
[1:35:59] world. And the scripture says, "Be not
[1:36:02] entangled
[1:36:04] again with the spirit of
[1:36:07] bondage." Don't entangle yourself. In
[1:36:10] other words, keep walking towards the
[1:36:13] light.
[1:36:15] God has more for us. God has never
[1:36:18] failed a human being.
[1:36:21] He's never left anybody alone. We just
[1:36:23] got to take God at his word. Consider
[1:36:25] how great God is and worship him. Take
[1:36:28] him at his
[1:36:29] word. Consider how great God is when you
[1:36:32] pray. When you're actually in prayer,
[1:36:34] that's the time. Consider how great God
[1:36:36] is. That he's great in the
[1:36:39] battle. That he will he answers prayer.
[1:36:45] God will see us through. Let's stand
[1:36:46] together. God bless you.
[1:36:50] God has given us all that we need to
[1:36:52] make it. Saints, everything that we need
[1:36:54] that pertainth to life and godliness.
[1:36:57] Consider how great God is in your life.
[1:37:00] Leave here and just think about how
[1:37:02] great God
[1:37:07] is. You know, the Bible tells us that
[1:37:10] God wants to
[1:37:11] be preeminent in the church.
[1:37:15] That means in order for God to be
[1:37:16] preeminent here, he needs to be
[1:37:19] preeminent in every one of us, right?
[1:37:22] Not not just not just the pastor, but
[1:37:26] every one of us because we are the I am
[1:37:27] not the church. I am not the
[1:37:30] church. I am just one person just like
[1:37:33] you. I make up as much of the churches
[1:37:36] as you
[1:37:37] do. I'm just one soul. You're one
[1:37:42] soul. And together, collectively, we're
[1:37:44] a body and we are the
[1:37:47] church. And and we need to consider God,
[1:37:50] how great God is in our lives. I believe
[1:37:55] God wants us to leave here with a faith
[1:37:58] that God is much greater than what we
[1:38:01] thought he was
[1:38:03] because the devil wants us to look at
[1:38:05] our problems and God wants us to look
[1:38:06] how great he is. Amen. And we just need
[1:38:09] to keep praising him and worship. The
[1:38:11] Bible says the offer the sacrifice of
[1:38:13] praise. What? Continually the fruit of
[1:38:15] thy lips making giving praise to
[1:38:18] God and just forget the
[1:38:21] problems. Forget the
[1:38:24] problems. Seek ye first the kingdom. All
[1:38:27] things shall be added unto
[1:38:30] you. I'm so
[1:38:33] glad I know my Jesus.
[1:38:39] I'm so
[1:38:41] glad I love his
[1:38:45] name. He the one who saved and
[1:38:52] sanifies my soul.
[1:38:57] I'm so glad I got
[1:39:03] acquainted with the one that is
[1:39:07] anointed. For he's the one who cleans
[1:39:13] and made me
[1:39:18] whole. I'm so glad I know my Jesus.
[1:39:25] I'm so glad I love his name. He's the
[1:39:31] one who saved and
[1:39:35] sanctifies my
[1:39:37] [Music]
[1:39:39] soul. I'm so glad I got
[1:39:45] acquainted with the one that is anointed
[1:39:50] for. He's the one who cleansed and made
[1:39:56] me whole. Let's sing it one more
[1:40:00] time. I'm so glad I know my
[1:40:06] Jesus. I'm so glad I love his name. He's
[1:40:12] the one who saved and
[1:40:16] sanifies my soul.
[1:40:21] [Music]
[1:40:22] So glad I got
[1:40:26] acquainted with the one that is anointed
[1:40:31] for. He's the one who cleans and made me
[1:40:38] whole.
[1:40:42] Oh,
[1:40:44] mercy
[1:40:46] rewrote my
[1:40:50] love.
[1:40:53] Mercy rewrote my
[1:40:58] love. I should have fallen. My soul cast
[1:41:05] down. But
[1:41:08] mercy rerote my
[1:41:13] life.
[1:41:15] Mercy rero my
[1:41:20] life. God's
[1:41:22] mercy rero my life.
[1:41:27] [Music]
[1:41:29] I should have fallen. My soul cast down,
[1:41:35] but
[1:41:37] mercy rro my
[1:41:42] love. Well,
[1:41:45] mercy rro my love.
[1:41:50] [Music]
[1:41:52] Mercy rro my
[1:41:55] [Music]
[1:41:58] life. I should have fallen. My soul cast
[1:42:04] down but
[1:42:07] mercy rewrote my
[1:42:12] life. Amen. How many's thankful for the
[1:42:15] mercy of God? Praise you Jesus.
[1:42:19] Without
[1:42:21] him, I could do
[1:42:24] [Music]
[1:42:27] nothing. Without him, I'd surely
[1:42:35] fail. Without him, I would be
[1:42:42] drifting like a
[1:42:44] ship
[1:42:45] without a sail.
[1:42:49] [Music]
[1:42:53] Jesus. Oh
[1:42:55] [Music]
[1:42:56] Jesus. Do you know him
[1:43:00] today? Please don't turn him
[1:43:04] away.
[1:43:07] Jesus. Oh
[1:43:11] Jesus. Without him how lost I would be.
[1:43:20] Without him, I would be
[1:43:27] dying. Without him, I'd be
[1:43:34] enslaved. Without him, life would be
[1:43:39] hopeless.
[1:43:43] But with Jesus, thank God I'm
[1:43:49] saved. Oh
[1:43:51] [Music]
[1:43:53] Jesus. Oh
[1:43:54] [Music]
[1:43:57] Jesus. Know him today. Please don't turn
[1:44:02] him
[1:44:04] away.
[1:44:07] Jesus. Oh Jesus.
[1:44:11] Without him, how lost I would
[1:44:16] [Music]
[1:44:19] be. He He's all I need. He's all I
[1:44:26] need. He's all I
[1:44:30] need. He's all I
[1:44:35] need.
[1:44:37] Jesus is all I need.
[1:44:44] He's all I
[1:44:46] need. He's all I
[1:44:51] need.
[1:44:52] Jesus is all I
[1:44:58] need. He's all I need. He's all I need.
[1:45:08] Jesus is all I
[1:45:13] need. He's all I
[1:45:17] need. He's all I
[1:45:21] need.

[1:45:43] need. He's all I
[1:45:47] need. He's all I need. Oh
[1:45:52] Jesus is all I
[1:45:58] need. Amen. Amen. You bow your hearts
[1:46:02] with me in a word of prayer. She
[1:46:04] continues continues to play that real
[1:46:07] quietly. He's all I
[1:46:12] need. Maybe there's been some things
[1:46:15] that you have put before
[1:46:21] God and you you've been thinking that
[1:46:24] you need that so bad.
[1:46:32] But today you realize that really all
[1:46:35] that you need is
[1:46:38] Jesus. That you want to set those things
[1:46:41] aside and you want to you really from
[1:46:45] your heart want to put Jesus
[1:46:49] first. Maybe you put him first in a
[1:46:52] little bit more of your life than than
[1:46:54] you have in the past. Maybe dedicate
[1:46:57] yourself a little bit more. Maybe
[1:46:59] consecrate.
[1:47:01] Maybe seek more of the Holy Ghost. Maybe
[1:47:04] just be more
[1:47:06] faithful. Maybe just allow him to be
[1:47:11] your
[1:47:12] standard. Allow him to be the head of
[1:47:14] the
[1:47:15] home, the head of a relationship, the
[1:47:18] head of the
[1:47:23] job. You're here today and you're
