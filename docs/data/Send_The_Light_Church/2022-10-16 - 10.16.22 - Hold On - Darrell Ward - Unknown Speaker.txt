[Music] knowing well that is our hearts begin to worship will be blessed because we came blessed because we came Hallelujah I pray that you're blessed this morning and the Lord continues to bless you foreign I am blessed I'm already blessed amen it's wonderful to be in the presence of young people who want God in their life and as you know brother James was singing there and he was inviting us to come and worship with him to come and praise with him and I I my thoughts kept going to when Jesus said suffer not the Lord children forbid them not let them come to me I believe that God inhabits the Praises of young people and we just we need to recognize that God is God is all in all that's right and uh we just want to praise him and everything and and lift them up and everything and and uh I like our our brother Daryl said that our children are not the Church of tomorrow but they are of today that's right let's not wait till tomorrow because we may not have tomorrow and they can reach Souls just like we can amen and uh just a willing heart that's what brother Daryl said all we need is a willing heart a willing a vessel that's that's willing to yield to the Lord and just use me Lord well God bless you we wanted to take up the offering uh and what we we want to have take this offering for brother Daryl it's uh it's expensive to travel and we just appreciate brother Daryl I I don't uh wasn't there when he was converted don't know how he was when he was that young in the Lord but all the time that I've known him he's just been an extremely humble person I could say I I feel that he's he hasn't changed he's he's just as humble as at the beginning and he's been in great meetings he's been used of God in great ways but he's remained humble I could even say I believe he's more humble today because as you go through those things and you resist popularity you resist money you you resist Fame and you remain you're actually more humble because you've been tested and tried and you stayed true my brother was telling me just yesterday that he'll travel six hours driving just to go speak to a few people a half a dozen people and that's commendable amen amen and he's a true servant of God and so as we take up the offering today we pray just remember that you're given to God's servant and uh let's just bow our heads in a word of prayer we're going to ask our brother Johnson if he would to pray over the offering yes Lord thank you Jesus Francisco finally let's see a part of Europe thank you Merry Christmas your grace for your kindness to all of us questions amen amen praise the Lord as we remain standing let's receive him amen brother Daryl makes a statement that you will find him in the baptism of the Holy Ghost so I I want the baptism of the Holy Ghost because I want him if I got to get the baptism Holy Ghost to get him that's what I want amen let's believe it today as we sing only believe in our brother comes to minister the last service amen [Music] oh We Believe all things are possible holy believe only believe all things are possible only [Music] Lord I believe Lord I believe Lord I believe all things [Music] Lord I believe all things [Music] amen as the Lord said do you now believe I'm so grateful that we know what to believe amen amen amen we kind of such an honor to be with you once again this morning and we just trusted what we have to say will be a blessing to you we feel like it's the direction that the Lord would want us to go and so whatever your need would be or whatever you would be facing just remember that no matter how great your sickness would be or how great your trial would be or your trouble would be it's not greater than your God it's not greater than your God and sometimes we have great trials just so that God can come and show us just how great he is you know the children of Israel if you think about it they came up on the Red Sea they had come out of bondage bitter bondage and those rejoices and they was just having a Revival and where did God lead them right to a ridge right right to the sea is that right brother Brandon said the water is in front of them the Mountain's on one side and here come the enemy in behind them but what did God do he opened up the water here they go rejoicing and praising God I mean what a miracle the ocean just opened up and the Bible said they went over on dry ground and here they went worshiping God and where did he lead them out into the desert the three days of no water is that not right so they find water and they start screaming and rejoicing and they go drink the water and what is it bitter bitter water but what did they do they cut down a tree and threw it into the water and turned a bit of water sweet and brothers said God done those things just to show them how much he loved them he loved them enough to split the Red Sea he loved them enough to take bitter Waters and make it sweet so sometimes the bitter Waters of her life is only God showing us just how much he cares for us that he could come amen and he could come and show us just how great a God he is How Great Is Our God he's worthy to be worshiped as our little brother saying this morning if you have your Bibles turn with us to the second book of Kings appreciate brother John allowing us to come I know he could have some great man to come and speak here at the church and because he allowed us to come and we certainly appreciate that and I believe you see brother Johnson back there God bless you buddy good to see you hadn't seen him since Mexico we've been a long long time we've done our together but it's good to see you brother second Kings chapter four starting at verse 25 and just feels good in here this morning doesn't it amen you know they was uh some of y'all as you're turning their second Kings 4 25 and some of y'all know brother Lindsey McGrady over in North Carolina he passes a little church over there and he's been involved with the byc for years and berlins has got two grandchildren and both of them was our backed out the same day one of them was with uh RSV I think they call it the little uh Kaya had RSV and the other one was uh born but it was born with some very very severe health issues and so both of them was on uh was was air back to another hospital that was able to take care of them but I just got word this morning that one of the grandchildren is is well off all oxygen and probably going to get to go home tomorrow so we're just so grateful for that amen we love our little ones don't we we certainly do second Kings chapter 4 verse 25 and I'm sure brother Lindsey appreciate you remembering his other grandson his name is Josiah and he's just really really needs a touch from the Lord matter of fact they even the hospital said that he just needs a miracle to even survive so but you know we serve a god of Miracles he's got it all in control second Kings chapter four we want to start reading at verse 25 and I'm going to read a little bit about a child who got into some distress so she went and came into the man of God of Mount Carmel and it came to pass that when the man of God saw her afar off that he said to gehaza his servant behold Yonder is that shudamite run now I pray thee to meet her and say unto her is it well with thee is it well with thy husband is it well with thy child and she answered it is well when she came to the man of God to the hill she caught him by the feet but gehaza came near to thrust her away and the man of God said let her alone for her soul is next within her and the Lord hath hid it for me and hath not told me then she said did I desire a son of my Lord did I not say Do not deceive me then he said to gehaza gird up thy loins and take my staff in thy hand and go thy way if thou meet any man salute him not and if any salute thee answer him not again and lay my staff upon the face of the child and the mother of the child said as the Lord liveth and as thy soul liveth I will not leave thee and he arose and followed her you know why because he couldn't get her off his hands let us bow our heads I want to speak to you for a few minutes this morning on hold on hold on Heavenly Father thank you Lord for your mercy and your grace we just love you today Lord and we thank you for the opportunity to serve you and Lord we just look to you today to meet every need that's in our midst Lord because that's just the kind of God you are but Lord you step out of the darkness into the light Lord to call us to yourself and we thank you for that Lord today and Father God I pray Lord that you would just move upon the hearts of your people that when we leave the building did we not say within ourselves did not our hearts burn within us blessed brother John Lord his ministry bless the saints of God here the other ministers may just lose them in a great way Lord we pray we commit this congregation into your hands For Your Glory in Jesus name and the Saints says amen God bless you made me seated now hold on by definition it means to endure or to keep going in difficult circumstances you know in some phrases of that would have the same meaning as hold on as if if only they could hold on a little longer and similar meanings or phrases that has the same meaning as hold on is to keep going to keep on to last to continue to persevere to struggle on to carry on to go on to hang on to hold out to not give up to see it through to stay the course or as we said when I was in the Army to sold your own to stick it out to stick with it to hang in there those are all of the same meaning of the words or the phrases of hold on so therefore then the opposite meaning of hold on is to give up to give up and we're living in a time where we see so many are just giving up they're getting discouraged and they're walking away and they're they're turning aside and they're they're struggling off to this website and they're going off to that website and they're they're you know they've let the pandemic give them an excuse for not coming to church no more and people just get just getting discouraged and just giving up but I say to you Church hold on this morning don't give up just hold on to the promises God's promises are true he will keep every promise of his word he'll keep to us this morning this Cinema woman that we read about in the Bible is to me is the very definition of hold on because she stayed the course she did not give up the to get an understanding of what's going on in the scripture we've got to go back to where the story starts this woman that we read about in the Bible it doesn't even give her name but I think many times it's done that way so that we could put our name there that we could identify ourselves with those scriptures so the Bible doesn't give her name but it does tell us where she's from she's from uh she's a shoot-em-out woman from the city of Humane now the word Humane means a double rest so this woman lived in a city of a double rest or a places of to rest amen and the shootout was a city in escar north of Manassas about five miles south of Mount Tabor it's where the location of this city was and the Bible says that the great prophet Elisha would travel through this city on his travels and so it came to pass that she noticed this man of God that she offered him some bread and befriended the man of God and one day she told her husband she said I want to make room in her house for the man of God that he could have a place to stay that when he passes through the city of rest he could find a place to rest so she made her a room in her home for the prophet of God and no doubt she called this room the Elisha room I've stayed in many of them amen you know but she what sticks out to me about this is that she made room in her home for the man of God and I think that would be a good thing for all of us to do this morning is to clean some of the junk not out of her home so much but out of our lives and make more room for Jesus you know Elisha the prophet Elisha told the Kings you want water then dig this Valley full of ditches and he said the deeper you dig the more water you'll have and I think that's a good thing for us that we dig down and get some of the garbage and the junk and the and the things that don't really matter get it out of our life and make more room for the water and the holy spirit amen or Hallelujah because the more we can empty out the more he can fill us up with himself amen oh my you know and I'm not against those things Instagram Facebook those things are all right but the trouble of it is we spend more time on Facebook than we do with our face in this book let's not get our priorities wrong let's keep our priorities right amen We Don't Belong To The World we're not a part of the world we belong to God we come from God and we'll go back to God and we're here for a purpose amen then God help me to keep my focus and not get distracted and when the things of the world tries to come into my life God help me to clean it out of my life and make more room for Jesus the color of the world let the Holy Ghost come in and saturate our souls so she did this act of kindness for the man of God and the Bible said he who receives the prophet in the name of a prophet receives a prophet's reward and the prophet taught us that God cares God cares for people who cares God cares for those who care for him the Bible says as you've done it unto the least of these my little ones you have done it unto me and so she'd done this for the man of God and that the prophet said it so pleased him it's so pleased Elisha that he wanted to do something for her and gehaza said to his to his master Elijah said she doesn't have a child and the prophet of God said bring her here and he said next time this time next year according to the time of life you will have the child and just as the prophet said she had the child and it was a boy now when the boy was about 11 year old one day he was uh he went with his papa out into the fields to work during the Harvest Time and the public said I believe he must have had a sunstroke because he grabbed his head and he began to say my head my head and he got more sick and more sick so the father being real busy he sent a servant with the boy to take the boy home so he takes this boy home who's complaining with a headache and lays him upon his mother's lap and the Bible says about new noontime the life went out of the child and he was dead the poor little boy died but I want you to notice what she did she took him and laid him on the prophet's bed now there's a real revelation that's a wonderful Revelation for us this morning notice she didn't take the boy to his bed neither did she take him to her bed or to the father's bed but she took him and laid him on the prophet's bed in the in the chamber where he slept because she knew that whatever that Prophet touched was blessed oh did you catch it this morning whatever that Prophet touched was blessed Church came we realized this morning how blessed we are our lives have been touched by the hand of God we are a blessed people this morning he's gave us life in the time of Darkness he's gave us peace in the time of trouble he's gave us rest in the time of unrest he's gave us Revelation in a time of insanity as I said last night there's so many questions today that may be true but we've got something they don't got we've got the answer or the prophet said Jesus Christ is the answer for everything you're going through amen glory be to God you may not have a hundred dollars in your pocket but we're rich this morning we have riches Untold we are blessed because our lives have been touched by the master and she says to her husband give me a servant let him settle up with you and go forward with me instead you told this service and now I don't even want you to stop and salute anybody or nothing go straight to the man of God up to Mount Carmel and the prophet said well that's it set your eyes on the go and don't look back what did the prophet tell us to look at in this day he didn't say look at the trouble he didn't say look at finances come on somebody he didn't say look at Fox News but he said look to Jesus get your eyes on the go and don't look back don't get sidetracked don't stop don't listen to doubters we've got plenty of doubters they'll always be here but just keep going but her husband her husband sometimes the greatest discouragement doesn't come from out there it'll come from right among our ranks is that not true they was 12 but over a spot out the land 10 of them came back and said we can't take it it's too great there's Giants in the land there's wild cities huh and the Bible said there was two million came out of Egypt and by that night that negative report we can't do it went through the whole camp and the Bible said there was weeping and wailing in the camp how fast negativism will go through a church but Lord God let positivism go through it like that let us be like Caleb and Joshua when he stood up and said give me my Mountain amen I will not fear when Giants come calling my name my God Is Bigger amen [Applause] Hallelujah sure she was wanting to get to this man of God and her husband said you're wasting your time it's neither new moon it's neither Sabbath he won't be there you're wasting your time he's not there it's over just forget it the boy's dead the doctor says it's too far alone the doctor says it's the worst case he ever saw let me tell you something this brother sister every time you start to make a move towards God you're going to have discourages you're going to have hindrances you're going to have obstacles to try to turn you back to try to try to discourage you to try to get you to keep to give up but I say to you just keep going don't listen to the critics just keep writing get the hold on get to where the word of God is being manifested when you find the word for your day being manifested you have found Christ amen Hallelujah amen hallelujah amen and when she got to worry like she was and he seen her coming and he says go ask her is it well with a husband just had a fight with him you know brother told me one time I hope this ain't true here but her brother told me one time sometimes it's hard to say Amen when you fight with your wife on the way to church she just had a big fuss with her husband about whether to go or not go is this thing on y'all hear me you look at me like you never had a fuss with your wife in your life come on Friends yes we're all human we all need grace even preachers come on just be honest but the prophet of God he said go ask her is all well with her husband you know he's a silent listener of every congregation hating God knows everything that's happening in your life at any moment come on somebody foreign is it well with my boy is it well with thee her son was laying dead on the prophet's bed she had had a disagreement with her husband on whether to go or not go but she said oh God she said it is well oh I like that all is well why because she was in the presence of the prophet and it's all thank you Lord if she had that much confidence standing in the presence of a prophet how much more confidence can you and I have this morning standing in the presence of the one who sent the prophets Amen brother Brandon ain't here but Jesus Christ is here this morning where two or three are gathered in my name I will be in their mystery man [Applause] Hallelujah [Music] standing in this water we are in the presence of the one who sent the prophet oh saints of God I say to you this morning all is well you may be having trouble but all is well you make me sick but all is well you may be having great difficulties I'm not belittling that I'm just trying to tell you all's well because we're in the presence of Jesus Christ and when she came to the man of God to the hill she called him by the feet now here she got even God as we say she got to the church service and the devil's still didn't stop trying to discourage her oh my God you're talking about a good adversary he's a good adversary we need to be as good a Christian as he as an adversary come on somebody she got to where she wanted to be and she got to the foot of the Prophet but here come gehaza and the Bible said he tried to thrust through it get off of him get off of him leave him alone but the man of God said to Gaza leave her alone her soul is vexed within her and the Lord hath hid it for me and he hath not told me so you see prophets don't know everything amen they only know what God will allow them to know you might as well say Amen to that somebody told me he said everything brother Branham said was thus saith the Lord I said really I said why did why did he have to say thus saith the Lord you ever heard Jesus say thus saith the Lord he never said thus saith the Lord come on somebody when he said thus saith the Lord what was he telling you this ain't William Branham this is God come on somebody amen he said leave her alone her soul is best and God hath hid this thing for me I don't know what's wrong with her but God knows what's wrong amen hallelujah and she said to the man of God she said did I desire did I come to you and ask you for a son did not I say don't deceive me then he said the guy he's a good up thou loins and take thy staff in my in thy handed if I meet any man salute him not and you know and don't answer me back and go lay it up on the face of the child but that wasn't good enough for her huh that's pretty good but the mother of the child said as the Lord liveth and that's our soul liveth I will not leave thee I will not leave thee and he arose and he follows her she said oh no I'm hearing your presence I'm not leaving you I'm holding on I'm not letting go of you you said God would give me a son if you spoke a son for me once you can do it again I'm not leaving you and I say to you saints of God if God has ever touched you once cannot he touch you again if he ever delivered you once cannot he Deliver us again if he ever forgave me and my sins was cannot he forgive me again amen think of it we serve a God who turned water into wine that's pretty good huh how many times does he have to do it before we believe him why do I like to see some sign or some light or some Goosebump or when are we going to get mature enough to take God at his word amen the promise of healing in the word is just as good as the doctor's saying there's no evidence of tumor amen well Glory Elijah seen he had her on his hands there was nothing else to do but go with her and the prophet of God said if you'll just stay with the Holy Spirit like she stayed with Elisha she grabbed me by the feet she wasn't letting go she was holding on she was Otis has it he said you stay on Jesus hands like that to think of it if he loved us enough to save us if he loves us enough to come to us if he loves us enough to send us Elijah then does not he love us enough to bless us and save us and heal us and change our bodies amen then stay with the one who gave the promise been God so good when I was on the mountain I was shouting and hollering amen but here I am in the valley listen to me that's the time to really praise him that's the time to really serve him come on that's where the battle really is we shot the victory on the Mountaintop amen Hallelujah don't give up Don't Turn back don't let go well brother you don't know how long I've waited really Comics Congressman Upshaw remember him yeah he fell off of a haywagon when he was a young boy and broke his back and he was paralyzed and he was in a wheelchair anybody remember how long 62 years I believe it was I thought it was 66 but I looked it up I believe it was 62 years really after 60 years does it really matter whether it was one or two or three or four the men had been in a wheelchair for a long time but my point is this how many people gave up that he would ever walk again huh if it didn't happen in 60 seconds or 60 Minutes or six months 62 years in a wheelchair you know people that's paralyzed you've been around some of them they're limbs they shrink because there's no nerves there's no stimulation for the muscle so they all swivel up I've seen people you know my daughter when she was in the accident had a severe brain injury it left her paralyzed like that she had no control over her body and just a few days her feet was starting to drop down and they was putting things on to try to keep them up here was a man that was in a wheelchair 60 some years can you imagine what his legs look like can you imagine how small they were oh God but when God said stand up Hallelujah I know what that is when Jessica was hurt they left her you know as I said it left her paralyzed but it also left her blind she couldn't see and everything came back she started walking again she started talking again started eating again and all the things that they said she'd never do but one thing it was it was slow coming back was her vision and they were telling us she will always be blind she has a condition called cortical blindness I believe it was and said she'll always be blind and I remember people calling and they was with us and I thank God please don't understand me I thank God for every phone call we got and people would call and say how's she doing I said well she's doing good they said is she seeing I said no she's not seeing you well praise God she will brother Daryl and a week went by and the phone ring how's she doing oh she's doing good is she seeing yet no no yeah well she well praise God she will brother we're with you brother we're praying with you four weeks went by five weeks how's she doing she's doing good is she seeing yet no well brother Daryl God bless you buddy and it got to the point that I told my wife I said I don't want to talk to people who try to discourage me I don't need their sympathy I need their prayers how soon we give up if it don't happen when we want to but you know there's a quote look it up there's a quote with the prophet of God said the outside world wants you to believe as soon as you lay your hands up on that crippled leg it should strike now and the people should jump for joy he said the problem of it is Jesus never said that but the world wants to believe that so when it don't happen what does it produce discouragement come on somebody but he never said that he said lay hands on the sick and they shall recover he never said when he never said when just be found believing amen with the stomach trouble in the corner and they was up there in the meeting in Chicago and they passed through the line and the angel Lord pronounced them both well and they go back to the neighborhood they live close to one another and the woman with the stomach trouble was testifying to everybody that God had healed her but she was still sick and her husband said I want you to stop your embarrassingness you ain't no better I want you to quit testified she said listen dear that man didn't know me and he told me my name he didn't know where I lived and he told me where I lived he didn't know what was wrong with me and he told me what was wrong with me and then he told me I was healed so I'm just going to keep on testifying yeah because if he knew all that he knows this she got up one morning weeks and went by and she got up one morning the kids left some oatmeal and they didn't eat it and they went off to school and she ate something it didn't hurt she ate some toast it didn't hurt she drank some coffee it didn't hurt she got excited maybe we got a little Pentecostal but I tell you when God gets real something has to start more I ain't never seen nobody on fire before that was calm about it have you you ever seen anybody on fire so well look you under I'm burning up my goodness nonsense I was out burning leaves one time and had a pair of raggedy britches on and I was kicking the leaves up in the fire and I was standing there watching it burn and all of a sudden I thought man my legs awful warm I looked down I said Jimmy crickets I'm on fire I was a beat my I was two seconds away from taking my britches off you said what are you saying I'm saying this when you're on fire it brings a reaction amen she got excited she was running up the street and when she got up at the weather woman had to go on her she gonna knock on the door and she heard inside and she went running in and the prophet said she was shaking the sheets looking for the corner and he said what was it he said it was the angel of the Lord passing through the neighborhood confirming the blessing amen let me tell you if you've been prayed for believe God believe that the angel is on the way don't be found doubting don't be found giving up hold on amen oh the father said I like it hold on when you take a hold of God for something don't you turn loose just hold on to him if we could take a hold of God's agent if we could just take a hold of God's agent God's agent then he said was Elisha but God's agent today is the Holy Spirit hold on to it when you ever come in contact and you feel the Holy Spirit on you then hold on to it I'll not leave you stay with it like Jacob did when he wrestled with the angel so I want to hold on to you and bless me I'm not giving up give me the things that I'm Desiring and the oh my it wasn't Jacob saying let me go let me go it was the angel saying let me go hey I ain't gonna let you go till I get what I need from you oh God give me that kind of faith hold on to him stay all night if you have to you see her faith wasn't in the staff it was in the prophet so she said as the Lord your god-liveth and never dies and your soul never dies I'm not going to leave you I'm going to stay right there with you and he said if you take Jesus for your healer don't let no devil or nothing else ever back you out of it hold on Amen amen I think I told you here before somebody was John about it there's a girl over in Romania years ago I was over there preaching the ucamp a young gypsy girl about 18 year old came up on a crutch she had no rights hip socket was born without a hip socket on the right side and her leg just swung like this it was shorter than the other one and it just swung like this when she walked and when she walked up and stopped she'd have to take this hand and stop her leg from swinging because it just swung just so she comes up on a I believe it was on a Friday night if my memory serves me right and she wanted to repent of her sins you see where I told her I said this you can stand right here and ask Jesus into your heart but that wasn't good enough she worked that leg brother John until she got down on her knees and repented and I thought my God how many people in America's got two good knees will never bow so the next morning you know what she done after service on Saturday morning she goes out to an icy River and goes into that water with that crutch and was baptized in Jesus name she comes back to church that night and she comes to the Altar and she says I want to be healed she said I want to be a mother I want to have children I want to have a husband but who would marry me like this and I told her I said sis you know what I do if I was you I quit asking God for my healing and I would just accept it and I said here's what I want you to do I said you take this handkerchief and you keep it with you and when God heals you you send it back to me as a testimony of what he done for you and I said I want you to take a bar soap and write on your mirror thank God for healing me and I said when you get up in the morning you thank God for healing you when you go to bed at night you thank God for healing you don't give up stay with it two or three years with my brother in church came up to me and said there's a sister in the chat room a Christian chat room said she knows you and she wants to send you an email I said well that'll be fine me and my wife will read it together no problem so I'll get this email didn't even know the girl's name I get this email her name was Christina she said brother Darryl been trying to find you said I want to share with you she said I did what you told me I went everywhere testified of my healer every service I would stand up and testify of my healing said it got to the place that my friends was making fun of me she said but I kept doing it I said I got up in a service one night and said I want to thank God for healing me I said I heard one of my friends say here she goes again she said but I kept on testifying she said about that time brother now she said my hip popped and she said I dropped the coach and walked out of the church well [Applause] amen and there was a brother I was at the byc kept a few years ago and a brother came up to me from Romania said brother Daryl I've been wanting to tell you said there was a girl over in Romania named Christina I said oh isn't it wonderful what the Lord did for her he said brother but what I want to tell you he said I was in the service I was sitting behind her and he said I saw her legs strong I saw her leg go out why she would not give up on the promise [Music] oh my Hallelujah stay with him as the Lord God your lives and your soul never dies I'll not leave you she said to Elisha till I find out about that baby so he couldn't get rid of her so that's the way you want to be with Jesus get on his hand stay there cry day and night that's the way don't turn loose don't back up if you believe it stay there there's Mercy in the Lord stay with it remember the teaching of the unjust judge he said about this woman said she just kept knocking on the door she was so persistent he turned her away today she'd come back tomorrow he'd turn away the next day she kept coming back and he said I neither fear God nor man but this woman told makes me day and night she cries after me Day and Night This Woman's driving me crazy oh Hallelujah but she got what she wanted because she would not give up and that's the way you want to get with God just be on his hands in the morning every morning every evening every night Lord I'm Gonna Keep On knocking because I know you're gonna answer amen amen that's when something happens that's when something happens he has to get you off his hands so he'll come out to answer you the prophet said when a woman was a because she cried out that how much more will God give the Holy Ghost to them who cry out for it I wonder sometimes if we're not serious enough how bad do we want it do we want it enough to leave our comfort zone do we want it enough to cry out do we want it enough to come to the Altar and pray how bad do you want a move of God how bad do you want a Revival in your church we've got to have faith to believe that God can do it and we'll do it and let's take a hold of it and hold on for it he's the God who sends Revival he is the god of Revival don't let go stay right with it if you don't come down to be 10 minutes if not 10 minutes it'll be on 10 hours if not 10 hours next week next month next year he will come he will come amen amen I'm not going to let go no matter how long it takes I got a hold of the promise I want to stay with it amen God said they laid their hands on the sick and they shall recover y That's the promise of his word amen amen amen God said they shall as I said he just didn't say when is that right like Elijah and Elisha Elijah and Elijah Elijah laid his hands on Elisha another story always get those two confused about you it's just they're so close together get tongue-tied but you know what I'm talking about Elijah laid his hands upon Elisha that's a lot better he ladies they laid that man on Elisha while he was plowing in the field and the mantle did not fit Elisha but Elisha wanted the mantle so what did he do he took off after Elijah he held on he wasn't leaving Elijah till he got that mantle he laid that man up on Elisha and it wouldn't fit but Elisha held on how many knows how long did Elisha you remember how long did he follow Elijah to get that mantle 10 years we can't wait 10 minutes you know the Pony Express we live in such an age of such impatience as soon as the light turns green the guy behind you blows the horn I was over 60 year old I got to move this leg but people are so it's true they're so impatient do you realize many many years ago the Pony Express you would write a letter Way Out West to somebody and you'd say hey John how you doing hope the cops are good and you give it to a guy on a horse and he rode and gave it to another guy on a horse and another guy on a horse and another guy on a horse and about a month later John got the letter and he opened it up and he read it hey John how you doing how's the Harvest John writes back good gives it to the rider to another Rider to another Rider to another Rider and a month later after the letter has been gone some three months you get the letter back from John and you carry it open and John says good but now if we send a text and it don't go through instantly we're smacking our phone you might as well say hey man that's why you've got a screensaver amen but notice Elisha it was 10 years but God never cut the man on the fit Elisha but he mowed it and shaped Elisha to fit the man and God will never you might as well say amen he will never cut this message to fit our petty ideas but he will cut us and mold us and shape us to fit this message amen and you know the story they got down there to the river and stuck the water parted across and Elijah turned Elijah said what do you want notice what he said he didn't say I want what you got it's good man you've got a real Ministry but he said I want more it's like the fella eating watermelon he said that's good they got to be some more somewhere all right right he just didn't want what Elijah had but after 10 years of walking with that prophet he said what do you want from me he said I want a double portion of your spirit oh the prophet said that's it that's the way to do it don't ask God for little things ask God for big things he's had the trouble of people today is let's say I asked the father for so much he said oh my don't be scared to ask him ask all you can ask he likes to give you just as much as you've got faith to receive don't you see my brother my sister when we ask God for big things we're telling God I believe you're a big God when we ask God for miracles we're telling God I believe you're a miracle working God hey man hey man well I'm afraid afraid God ain't gonna run out he got plenty of blessings just hold on to the promise amen Elisha got that medal he goes back down to the same river with the same metal struck the same water and he said where is the god of Elijah he wasn't asking a question he was making a statement where is the god of Elijah he will tell you he's here the man who was his and the prophet said Elijah and Elisha is a type of Christ in his church and Jesus said the things that I do shall you do also and More Than This shall you do what was he telling the church a double portion now you can't do nothing greater than raise the dead but the war you see what Jesus done in his ministry it was one man it was God working through one man doing signs and wonders but now it's a greater that was in the bridegroom but now it has moved over into the broadest we looked at last night and now all around the world signs and wonders what God was doing through one man now he's doing through a many membered body doing what making Saint John 14 12 a reality today they shall lay their hands on the sick and they shall recover Hallelujah on the day what did Jesus do on the day of Pentecost he pulled off that mantle and let it drop down to his disciples where is the god that was on Jesus Christ where is the power of his resurrection it's in the church today amen these promises were true let's hold on to them sold your own keep pressing on don't give up Don't Turn back don't let go I'm just so discouraged but hold on to Jesus the doctor says it's bad but hold on to Jesus don't look at the situation look at the solution as long as you look at the situation that's all you'll ever see don't just look at the symptom look at the Cure Look to Him grab a hold of the promise let that black girl did down in Memphis she was blind and they're hurting the radio that God had opened the eyes of a blinded man up in Jonesboro Arkansas the man lived from up in Kennett Missouri and he come over to Jonesboro the prophet God talked about that meeting he said I was on the platform eight days and nights and I made a vow he said that I would pray for everybody that was sick but he said after eight days of just staying at the platform drinking orange juice you know just just just the Necessities that a man needs to do but stay in there praying for the sick he said at the end of eight days there was this many to pray for as there was the first day and he said I was there and they come and got me said brother Brenham there's a woman out in an ambulance that's dead so I said I went out and I went around through the crowd this way and got up in the ambulance maybe maybe you remember the story if you've never heard the story go to a message called testimony preach the Los Angeles California 1959 it's about 21 minutes long but man gives this testimony it's just that's the title of it it's a testimony I don't know if you've ever heard it or not but I always listen to it right before I pray for the sick and just always list my faith for some reason but he said I went around I called up in the Emerson I prayed for the woman and she raised up so I came out of the animals and they said brother we'll never get you back in the way you came we're going to have to bring you around this way so he was passing through the crowd going this way and he heard this girl now her father they got the money and chartered a bus from from Memphis up to Jonesboro Arkansas and here her father says now you stand right here and I'll get the Healer for you but while she was standing there so many people on the outside trying to get in they bumped her and caused her to move and she couldn't see so she lost her way and she was out there in the crowd and she was crying out Mercy with someone have mercy on me I'm blind I can't see and I've lost my papa amen now brother Brandon was going around this way and he said you see how God locks things in just exactly right he said why did he have me to go around this way instead of the way I came and here he was passing through the crowd then I was sharing this with Brother John was talking the other night as we drive into the room that as I was looking at this and this this just dumped out at me that big brother better come out of the animal and he was walking through the crowd now that crowd was there for one reason that was to get brother Branham to pray for him but they didn't know brother Brennan from Adam they have no monitors like we got they couldn't see what was going on inside all they knew there was a man in there praying and God answered his prayer I hope I'm not too long this morning so he's passing through the crowd and no doubt you know him I said stepped on somebody's foot back said he said excuse me I I didn't mean that I'm trying to get around this way I'm sorry I hope you're okay and they might have said would you get out of my way I'm trying to get in there and see the Healer and the Very one that was wanting to see was passing right through and they didn't recognize it and as I was looking at I thought how many times has Jesus that's right passed right through our congregation yeah and we failed to recognize it right because maybe it wasn't the our favorite preacher oh my God what would it be that day to realize how many times he sat right beside you and you failed to recognize it Superman said I got to where she would bump into me and he said do you need something she said you know the story how many knows the story she she said I I've lost my papa so I can't find him he said we came up from Memphis we got the money got on the bus came up here to see the Healer he said the watch he said the Healer he said surely you don't believe that he said as many fine doctors as we have today she said but you see sir they can't help me they can't help me and he said do you believe that that man prayed for you that you'd see again she said I tell you what sir if you'll get me to the Healer I'll find my daddy myself and I looked at her and I said maybe I'm the one you're supposed to see he said you see how God locks things exactly right why was I taken back that way and she grabbed me by the lapels of my coat like that and she said are you the Healer and I said no sister I am not of just your brother Jesus Christ is the Healer she said I want to see the Healer and I said I hope that you see him someday and I believe you will and she said what's your name he said brother Bradham she said use the one I want to see he said now no one knows me I'll pray for you but but don't let it be known take your hands off he said and I couldn't pull her hands off of my lapel she was holding on for dear life praise God and I said I can pray if you'll believe I can pray if you'll believe and she said that's all I ask you to do and he said we bowed our heads and we were praying and while we were praying I heard a scream and she ran out into the lot throwing people one way or the other way and she fell on the ground screaming I was once blood I could now see he said a few weeks ago I got a letter from her her eyes are 20 20. she don't even have to wear glasses or nothing he said it's the amazing grace of God that does these things it's something that Jesus Christ gave to his church to enjoy the Privileges of good health and when those people saw that young girl with her sight that stood an old man with a club foot with a club and a twisted foot and he said I know who you are brother Brandon I've been standing here three days in the rain and if you'll just ask God will heal my foot not three minutes brother about 30 minutes I've been standing here three days in the rain you talk about holding on you talk about not giving up not turning back three days the brother said what can be done at a time like that and I said here my brother if you believe that Jesus died and Rose on the third day to make these things possible hand me your club and when he handed me that club he wasn't kidding he meant it I seen with my own two eyes that Twisted club foot come straight and he jumped up in the air and began to scream and four men rushed around me people with mothers with their babies tried to get in close enough just to touch that old raggedy coat it was and God was healing them it wasn't a ragged coat nor was it the one wearing it right it was the Lord Jesus that's here this morning harder in their faith and I say to you if he honored their faith he will honor our faith if your faith can only declare that he's here for you you know her brother biscos say something one time but always stuck with me is just a young man but brother bisco he was preaching down our way and he said one time he said Jesus Christ will be just as real to you as your faith can declare him to be and I thought that's right brother John some people see Jesus every time they come to church and some people never see him because their faith cannot declare that he's here oh God oh God amen if your faith can only declare that you see her then what should we do this morning let's let our faith go let's just let our faith go let's just believe him let's just start accepting that let's just start receiving it let's just start thanking him for it Hallelujah he said but what if I do that and it won't work let me tell you something it'll never work if you mix doubt with your faith brother Brennan said he always comes where he's asked but he'll never come where he's doubted he'll never come where he's doubted then let's don't be found doubting but no you just don't know what I'm going through maybe you don't know what I'm going through with but that don't matter it don't matter whether it's the worst case the doctor ever seen or whether somebody look at it and say you mean that's bothering you it means something to God God cares amen brother remember since he cared he cared so much he raised think about this God cares so much he raised the bluegill who was dead floating on the Dale Hollow Lake he raised that fish from the dead the prophet of God said he's done that to show us he cares for the little things he said I had a meeting of a child on my prayer list and God raised a little fish that didn't even have a soul from the dead to let us know he cares for every aspect of Our Lives the littlest thing in your life God cares oh that'll make a Baptist out just let your faith hold on to God for your need this morning don't worry who's Beside You Jesus is here just reach out to him you need healing ask him you need forgiveness asking you need Deliverance ask him you need answers you got to make decisions ask him he's an ever-present help in the time of trouble Vietnam and as we close can you imagine can you imagine how it was that night at the house of the shooter Mike woman with her boy who that that afternoon was dead laying on the prophet's bed was sitting at the table eating SpaghettiOs I'd say there was some shouting I'd say there was some singing I'd say there's some rejoices oh in just a small way I remember how it was when we came home from the hospital with Jessica when all the doctors had told us she would never live but the lord gave her back to us and I remember when we came home that day after being gone 67 days in the hospital and we came home and all the there was news people out there WJHL WCYB for the local TV stations was out there film and Jessica coming home and they had banners said the miracle girl and all the people were there but when all the people left we closed the door it was such Joy because Jesus had come to our home I gave my little girl back to us he wasn't long after that she's about six-year-old I'm closing he's about six-year-old and we were she was out in the front yard playing about a few she's only three when she got hit by the train and so a few years later she was out in the front you're hard playing and I was over on the side raking leaves we live out in the country I could hear the car coming down the road and it started slowing down you know this day and age when your kids is out in the yard and the car slows down you kind of want to see who it is you know so I kind of eased up into the front yard this guy slowed down and he saw Jessica he tooted the horn she looked up from playing and he waved at her like this and he gave her a thumbs up and then he saw me brother John and he waved at me and he gave me a thumbs up and I gave him a thumbs up back and he went on down the road and I began to think that the same Lord Jesus who touched blind Bartimaeus is the same Lord Jesus that went to jairus's house and gave his daughter back to him is the same Lord Jesus that went to that black girl down in Jonesboro Arkansas and opened her eyes it's the same Lord Jesus who opened the eyes of my uncle that was singing and they were shouting and there was rejoicing the boy that had laid dead on the prophet's bed was sitting at the table eating separated because she said she held on and she would not let go All Saints don't never give up don't never turn back don't never let go amen do you love him this morning let us bow our heads Hallelujah Hallelujah oh thank you Lord Jesus your promises are true Lord you're the same yesterday today and forever God I'm so glad we don't have to go all the way back into the Bible days and we don't have to go all the way back into the 60s when your Prophet was here to find that she was doing something but that same Lord God is doing things today people being healed cancers disappearing Lord as we've done in Cottonwood Arizona just a few months ago a sister there with a tumor on her chest was putting an ointment on in the stuff of seeing a doctor about it and sitting there in the service just rejoicing as we were sharing some of the things we've seen the Lord Jesus do and she was just rejoicing not even prayed for Lord but she goes home and took off her blouse she said to put some ointment on that tumor that was on her chest and when she took off her blouse the tumor was gone it had disappeared during the service oh that's the kind of God we serve that's the kind of God you are Lord like he did for brother James Tidwell over at the byc camp a few years ago when he had a tumor in his ear been there for three years and he would scab over and bleed and scab over and bleed but that night in the prayer line when we had everybody to lay hands on one another and pray for the needs of the people and brother brother James Tidwell just lay his hands on those young Brothers there and prayed with those young brothers and he went and laid down that night Lord and went to sleep when he woke up in the morning looked in the mirror that tumor that had been in his ear for three years was gone wasn't even a scab or nothing that's the kind of God you are Lord just like you did for our sister down there in Russellville Kentucky who had that tumor on her breast and it disappeared during the service that's the kind of God you are Lord as you did for Scott Smith's mother over in North Carolina who had the torn rotator cuff and right there at the end of the service you came down among the people she couldn't even raise her arm was up for surgery but she moved up on brother Scott's mother and the spirit of God moved upon her and healed her completely of a torn rotator cuff oh my how the roar went through the congregation when they saw Lord or the moving of your spirit you're the same yesterday today and forever and we worship you today and we call upon your name today because we're holding on to you dear God for the answer to every need that we have you're the answer today you're the answer tomorrow it was the

up for prayer but there was just something bothering you because you felt that it just wouldn't happen because with the expectation that it's got to happen now or it's not faith because that's the biggest trick of the devil if it don't happen right now then we think it's not Faith but we were told today that there's no limit to the promises of God as far as time is concerned so that should increase our faith to be able to come get prayed for and believe regardless of how we leave the building today it's going to happen and that we are to continue rejoicing in what we have been promised amen as if it did happen that moment even though it may not happen for two years we still got to testify of it every day we don't have to leave here feeling that we didn't have faith because it becomes a a trick of the enemy um you're trying to muster up Faith and feel defeated and we just got to leave here believing regardless of how we feel maybe we've just been letting doubt creep in because it didn't happen as fast as we wanted it God knows we want it God wants us to see us keep rejoicing maybe we just need to Rejoice more we need to take uh the attitude that we heard today through the scriptures and just hold on hold on to the promise Deliverance healing more the Holy Ghost more the character of God these are what God has promised all of us and let's just believe for it and and one thing something happens we want a testimony we want to sin and testify of it because it will increase all of our other faith amen yes yes pray God very very difficult dark dark days and I

somebody amen amen um did anybody have any uh sister Genie did you feel like saying anything no for about 28 years and to leave and come here and it's not because no I just like you guys together we're just a small generator from Brother Johnson hey Ben come in here and enjoying the services amen well let's welcome our precious sister [Applause] may we always make one another feel like they're best friends they're best friends yes straight has had something that was on my heart it has been for the last service but I never want to fail to hand out roses This Side of Heaven and it really spoke to my heart but I wanted to thank Brother Bruce when he came up and he gave that special he could have come up and did it perfect but I've heard him play Perfect yeah I know what he's capable of but to see him come up here and persevere amen and to see him be determined and to do it anyways yes it encouraged me because I know how difficult it is playing a mouth instrument and how any emotion that gets in there can completely throw off everything but I'll tell you the presence of the Lord blessed me so much by your mistakes but your perseverance amen and I want to thank you for coming up and being real it blessed me amen praise the Lord amen amen I didn't say that exact those exact words that it was real close when I took Brother Bruce I said when you when you play because it really whipped them out playing all those songs afterwards I said well just play one or two that's it just one or two it would be a great blessing to us so let's pray for our brothers praise for us continue to pray for his heart and
