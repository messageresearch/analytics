So, we pray that God will meet you where you come in. Amen. Uh let's just uh remember our brother Gideon's coming uh Sunday, right? And brother Aaron will be here again next Wednesday. Is that correct? Right. So let's remember them two announcements. Also, uh I was cleaning the church today and that back door was open. It was it it seemed like it was I pushed on a couple times and it opened and it but it looked locked. So, it's just kind of a warning to everybody that uses that door until we have a look at it. So, make sure you shut shut the door behind you and it's locked. And let's let's remember our sister Cheryl. She's having surgery on Friday yet again. And uh we just pray that the doctor will uh do what he needs to do and she gets a speedy recovery and uh gets rid of the uh chronic cough that she's had. &gt;&gt; And uh we're looking for a full restoration. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So let's just be praying for our sister on Friday. Amen. And if you could also remember my sister that's staying with me for a couple weeks here um because of foot surgery um that uh she needs a a deeper walk with Christ. But we all do. So just pray on her behalf, please. Uh let's just remember um our brother Aaron who's coming expecting tonight. I pray that &gt;&gt; you know God will meet your God's got a table a full table &gt;&gt; and sometimes we are our appetite doesn't meet his table. So come with a good appetite and he'll feed you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. So let's just stand tonight. Amen. Uh let's just ask the Lord to just bless the person next to you and uh &gt;&gt; give them revelation tonight and uh that we can all just be on one accord. Heavenly Father, as we come to you tonight, Lord, we've come to you with these requests, Lord, for our sister Cheryl, on this surgery that's coming up, Lord, we know, Lord, that you're in charge, Lord. And we we have faith in that, Lord. And we're trusting in you for that, Lord, that she know this surgery will take care of this chronic cough that she has, Lord, and you just make a full restoration in her life, Lord God. So, oh Lord God, as we come to you tonight, Lord God, with heavyhearted things for many things that would be personal upon our hearts maybe, Lord, but Lord, you know every one of our thoughts, Lord. So we, Lord, just pull them into captivity tonight and turn them over to you, Lord God, that you might know our prayers, Lord, that you might act upon our uh faith, Lord, tonight, Lord, to resolve these issues in our lives, Lord. whatever it would be, Lord God, we know that you're more than capable of doing it, Lord, if we just get out of the way. So, Lord, as we so go on in in this service tonight, Lord, we just pray that these uh prayers and the these offerings of worship and praise, Lord, would just bring an atmosphere that would be pleasing unto you. So, we thank you for all these things in precious name of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. Amen. You may be seated. Amen. Amen. Uh let's do a uh special because um I don't know if this is pre or not, but uh our sister Elizabeth was going to sing a special Is that okay? Yeah, that should be okay. Thanks. [Music] I've truly known the good life filled with family and friends. I've been blessed with more than my share. And yet with all of my good fortune, my heart is sinking still. Oh, I just can't deny the longing. It's Jesus I really want to see. It's Jesus I really want to see. The more I see of this world, the less it means to me. Yes, it's Jesus. I really want to see. I've been a lot of places. I've known the great and small. I've seen the grand and known the works of men. But in the heart of my heart, I know there's more for me. So much more than this fading world I see. It's Jesus I really want to see. It's Jesus I really want to see. [Applause] The more I see of this world, the less it means to me. Yes, it's Jesus I really want to see. And the more I see of this world, the less it means to me. Yes, it's Jesus I really want to see. [Applause] Amen. It's what we have our eyes focused on, isn't it? We can see him tonight. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Cuz he's here. &gt;&gt; Just need spiritual eyes. That's all. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's just sing uh It's not by might. Amen. It's not by might. It's not by power, but by my spirit, saith the Lord. It's not by might, it's not by power, but my spirit, saith the Lord. This mountain shall be removed. This mountain shall be removed. This mountain shall be removed. By my spirit, saith the Lord. It's not by mine. It's not by power, but by my spirit, saith the Lord. It's not by mine. is not by power but by my spirit saith the Lord. This mountain shall be removed. This mountain shall be removed. This mountain shall be removed. By my spirit, saith the Lord. Amen. Amen. Hallelujah. A mountain is just a thought of unbelief &gt;&gt; because all things are possible. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Well, let's just cast out any unbelief and just believe. &gt;&gt; God said that to me. Let's just stand. Amen. Uh we're going to take up the tithes and offerings. Brother John, can you do that? Heavenly Father, thank you for a place together. &gt;&gt; Lord, thank you that you made it a way that we could have what we have. Your plan has always worked from the beginning. We just pray that you would bless and multiply the offering that be taken up and that you bless your people for giving. Lord, may it just meet every need that we would have. We give you praise for these things in Jesus name. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. You may be seated. Uh, brother Johnny, you want to come up and we'll just sing in the presence of Jehovah. Amen. in the presence of Jehovah, God Almighty, Prince of Peace. almost vanished. Hearts are managed in that presence of the king. [Music] In the prayer I bless you of Jehovah [Music] God Almighty, prince of peace, trles vanish, hearts are mened. in the presence [Music] of our king. Let's stand together and sing that in the presence of Jehovah God Almighty. [Music] Prince of peace, trles and hearts are mened in the presence of the king. Amen. We are standing on holy ground. are standing [Music] on holy ground. And I know that there are angels all around. Let us praise Jesus now. We are standing in his presence on holy ground. We're believing it. We are standing on holy ground. And I know that there are angels all around. Let us praise Jesus now. We are standing in his presence on holy ground. Amen. and how unworthy &gt;&gt; we are to be in the presence of Jehovah. &gt;&gt; We're unworthy. We're unworthy. And I believe it's that that attitude that brings God on the scene. &gt;&gt; Think a prophet Isaiah, a prophet. We're not prophets. He was a prophet. And yet he felt so unworthy to be in the presence of Jehovah. Amen. &gt;&gt; We're a blessed people today to know how to reverence the Lord. Amen. How to respect the Lord. Amen. I'll say it's a great privilege for us to have brother Aaron, Sister Elizabeth, the family. They're growing pretty soon. They're going to be ministering here, but we don't get to have brother Aaron as much. And we're just so much appreciate him. He's just as solid as can be. And let's just invite him to come forward. Give us the word of life today as we sing um only believe. Only believe. Amen. Only believe. Only believe. All things are possible. Holy believe, all isol. [Music] All these are my soul. Sing it again. Only believe. Heat. Heat. is our only [Music] All. And that's our our national anthem. Fear not, believe only. &gt;&gt; I believe that all things are possible by faith through God. And I just I love singing that song because it reminds us just to keep believing. &gt;&gt; Truly is the word only &gt;&gt; in this hour and and our faith in it. And I think that's what the preaching of the word to promote. &gt;&gt; So good to be here with you this evening. I consider it a great privilege as usual. I was thinking today, I meant to ask the question, but I think I'm beyond the age now that brother John was when I first came and ministered here and since the church first started and I was thinking I've been preaching here just as long as you have since 2001. So, it's um you guys have already heard everything I know and maybe twice. &gt;&gt; Uh but the uh it's just awesome to come and be here. It was nice to see some of the young men and I think brother Jonathan was there too on Saturday in Literal Life Church with brother Paula Fontaine. They had a men's meeting on Saturday morning and then also again that Sunday evening was tri-state so got to see some of you then and sister Russell got to see Matt and Hannah. It been a long time since I seen them and so it's just really nice to connect and that's why we're here earlier than usual. I know you guys were all just getting ready for it in August, but we decided to come a little bit early and we're really really happy to be here. Brother John and Sister Cheryl dearly, and I'm glad that they I have grandchildren and a wonderful wife enough for them to put up with me for a couple weeks. Mark chapter 13 verse 22. I'm going to be ministering on a lot of familiar scriptures and maybe even a familiar theme in some ways where it may seem like well this is we've heard something like this before remind a lot of these things but I do want to come at it from a little bit different angle and so if you'll just patient with me and if you love going through the scriptures you'll enjoy the service tonight but my title is seduced to sin. I know that may be kind of a a catchy title, but if the influences do it and the news articles do it to get as clickbait, uh, I'll use it myself tonight. Seduced to sin. Mark 13:22. For false Christ and false prophets shall rise and shall show signs and wonders to seduce, if it were possible, even the elect. Notice the the way that Mark emphasizes it here. not just to deceive, if it were possible, but to seduce, if it were possible, even the elect. If we could just bow our heads in a word of prayer. Heavenly Father, we're so grateful to be gathered together this evening in your presence. Lord, &gt;&gt; and we know that where two or three are gathered together in your name, there you are in our midst. And where you are, there's that power and that potential for all things, Lord. As brother Ron already admonished us, you're here now. And we believe that, Lord. And then to think that it's not just two or three, but it's dozens here tonight. &gt;&gt; That the the church house is full and visitors have come in and with such a wonderful atmosphere and a beautiful worship, &gt;&gt; we should believe, Lord, tonight that you can speak to us because you desire to. You promise to. So we commit ourselves to you now trusting that your word will just flow freely that we could receive it into our hearts. Lord, may we not try to understand it in the way that the minister is emphasizing it, but catch your heart, Lord, to catch what you would have us to see, what you would have us to hear. We ask this in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. You could be seated. Lord, &gt;&gt; I want to define what I mean by seduced right off the bat so you can kind of see what direction we're going in this. But to seduce or to be seduced, if you seduce someone, it would cause to go astray. So if you are seduced, you've been caused to go astray. You've been led away from truth into error. And that's maybe the primary meaning in the scripture. If you're seduced, you're led away from truth into air. You're not can't really be seduced from one error to another. That's just the uh outcome of following the wrong kind of leadership. And so you're seduced from truth into air. And as I look at this seduced and that's the way that we're wanting to present it tonight, I I'd like to give a a close look at sin and not that we're going to talk about all sorts of things that are sinful, but as a concept or as a thing and really really drill down on how we're taught in the message of the hour of what sin is. And I'll say this to completely overcome, it's important to understand the nature of sin. And I know in saying that as I've meditated it on this week, we might think, oh well, am I constantly making mistakes? I don't understand it perfectly or completely. But it's in that vein of to overcome is to recognize the devil and every one of his tricks. So we're going to overcome completely. There is it's important to understand the nature of sin &gt;&gt; and arrogance and constant failure that that pride and even failure and and constant stumbling are two consequences of not recognizing sin not understanding what sin is. As Paul said we are not ignorant of his devices. So there's there must be some revelation insider or understanding. Maybe a good way to put it would be discernment of sin and the one that uh and its nature and how that it works in order to completely overcome it. &gt;&gt; Romans chapter 6 verse 23 it says for the wages of sin is death but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord. So there's uh these two two different things wages of sin and the gift of God. And it says it it is eternal life. The gift of God is eternal life, but the wages of sin is permanent separation from God. So that's the that's the results of sin. And if sin results in permanent separation from God, I want to know what sin is. &gt;&gt; If that's what's going to keep me distant from him or separate from him, and we do know the other hand of overcoming is not only recognize that the devil and all of his tricks, but recognize that greater is he that is in you that than he that is in the world. and he's already overcome him. So the other side of it is the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen. &gt;&gt; So in this scripture we could say that we have sin's wage on one hand versus God's gift on the other. And I like this scripture at the outset because I would never want to lose sight of this is that sin can only be understood as a contrast to God or in relationship to God. Can't just really examine sin on its own and really understand it. You want to first understand that there is a holy, there is a truth, there is a right. And therefore the perversion uh is something that is twisted, manipulated or in some ways deviated from truth. As we know a lie can be just it's a truth perverted. &gt;&gt; So the wages of sin is death. The gift of God is eternal life. So sin has a consequence. And really sin and its consequence only really begins to be understood in light of the fact that the gift of God is eternal life. Sin will give you uh death but God will give you eternal life through Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Now I want to look at a number of scriptures. I might have a a dozen or so in the outset here just to look at sin and its nature because misinterpreting sin leads to confusion about our sinful state. And and I I go through this knowing that you all are familiar with them. You'll finish the verses even before I get to them. Uh because you know them, but it's important to just recognize scripturally the condition that we're born in. Psalm 51:5, "Behold, I was shapen in iniquity, and in sin did my mother conceive me." This is that innate sinfulness that all mankind has from the original sin. There's none of us that are born. No matter how, especially some of the young ones here, no matter how perfect uh this may be to my family, no matter how perfect your dad is, you're born in sin. That's just the way that it is. No matter how wonderful your mom is, no matter how you feel that they can never make a mistake, we are born in sin. And the writer here is saying that sin is in me and I am in sin. &gt;&gt; And so this is that innate sinfulness for all of us. Sin is in us and we are in sin by birth. Isaiah 64:6 says, "But we are all as an unclean thing, and all our righteousness are as filthy rags, and we all do fade as a leaf, and our iniquities like the wind have taken us away." This isn't just saying, "Well, we all have some growing up to do, or we don't all come out of the womb on the same level, saying we're all unclean." any righteousness or good in contrast to God is as a filthy rag that because of sin we fade and our iniquities drive us like the wind that's taken us away. Romans chapter 7 verse 5. For when we are we were in the flesh the motions of sins. Notice that phrase, the motions of sin which were by the law did work in our members to bring forth fruit unto death. This means we're all naturally inclined to sin. We could say I'm born in sin and that just maybe be this abiding state, this way that I'm born. I'm born in the flesh. No matter what I do, I'm born in sin. But it's not just to be born in sin, but the motions of sin work within us to bring forth fruit unto death. It says that our iniquities like the wind have taken us away. We've been shaped and conceived and then moved and animated and we're naturally inclined to sin. This is a fun scripture in Jeremiah 13:23. Can the Ethiopian change his skin or the leopard his spots? Then may ye also do good that are accustomed to do evil. And it's saying that it's natural to sin. That the nature of sin is in us by our first birth. So we all have are born in sin. No matter if you never spoke a lie, if you did everything right, even according to the law, you're still in sin. You still would need an approp appropriation for your sin, proper perpetuation for your sin. You'd need to be accepting of the blood of Jesus Christ. But by the first birth, we have this nature to do evil. Paul writes it this way in Romans 7:1 18. For I know that in me, that is in my flesh, dwelleth no good thing. For to will is present with me. But how to perform that which is good I find not. &gt;&gt; Amen. It's not how how can I perform uh my own righteousness because that can be performed through discipline. But to do good, the only good and uh the only good is the father and every good and perfect gift cometh from above. It says to do good, I don't have it within me naturally. It's not innate. It's not my instinct to be to be truly righteous or divine. &gt;&gt; Psalms 58:3 says, "The wicked are estranged from the womb. They go astray as soon as they be born speaking lies. I know sometimes in the message brother Brandon would convi combine Psalms 51 and Psalms 58, but you see just how perfectly they fit together. Shaping iniquity and sin did my mother conceive me. I've come from the womb speaking lies. I know it maybe doesn't seem to be a very light sermon tonight. This is all the dark stuff, but it's kind of how you create tension in a sermon. You got to build that sermon. And in the end, we look to Christ, who is our hero, who delivers us from sin and death. &gt;&gt; But they go astray as soon as they're born, speaking lies. Romans 3:26 3 says, "For all have sinned and come short of the glory of God." &gt;&gt; Just making sure nobody has an out tonight. Somebody may say, "Well, I don't know about this. I don't know about By the time we're done, you're boxed in." &gt;&gt; You know that you come into the world speaking lies. You know that you're sinful by nature. You know that in you dwelleth no good thing. Amen. &gt;&gt; Ecclesiastes chapter 7 verse 20. For there is not a just man upon the earth that doeth good and sinnth not. &gt;&gt; I know that may think, well, I know some really good people, but you have to take it all together. A just man that does good and sins not. Maybe we've known some just men. Maybe we know some that have done good in the flesh, but there's none that they could say they have not sinned. &gt;&gt; Where it says in 1 John 1:18, if we say that we have no sin, we deceive ourselves and the truth is not in us. &gt;&gt; Just imagine that. We don't even need the devil to seduce us. We'll seduce ourselves. If we say that we have not sinned, &gt;&gt; for all have sinned. We say we have none, we deceive ourselves and there cannot be truth in us. So there's this element of truth that acknowledges our in the inherit sinfulness in us by the first birth. Ephesians chapter 2 verse one even speaking of how that we have been quickened and we've been raised from this death. He says, "And you hath he quickened who were dead in trespasses and sin." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; In order to be quickened, you have to have at one time been dead in sin. You must have been driven by the motions of sin. That iniquity as a wind driving you away. But that's the rescue of Christ who takes you out of that tempest of sin and sets you up on a solid rock. And that's that you were dead in trespasses and sin and now you've been quickened. Romans chapter 8:7. Because the carnal mind is immity against God, for it is not subject to the law of God, neither indeed can be. Speaks again of that sinfulness that's in us by birth. The fact that we're human. The fact that we're born of a woman. The carnal mind, the natural mind is opposed to God. It is not righteous. It is not holy. It does not think like God. It does not act like God. God says, "Your ways are not my ways. Your thoughts are not my thoughts." And they're so far and separate and apart that they're not even likened unto one another. They're actually enemies to each other. This is the nature of our first birth. Says in Romans chapter 5:12, I think if we look at this, we can begin to just recognize a little bit now the origins of sin. Wherefore, as by one man sin entered into the world, and death by sin, and so death passed upon all men, for that all have sinned. Now, we recognize we we're all sinners. And you say, "Well, brother," and you read about a dozen quote uh statements already that prove that. Now, we can kind of back into this. We've all sinned, but and and sin is the w death is the wages of sin. But how do we get there? By one man. Sin entered into the world. And as sin entered into the world by one man, death came by that. Therefore, death is upon all man because man is born in sin and sin is in him. Genesis chapter 2 25. Now we can see these contrasting conditions. The one uh the one condition of being sinless and the other condition of being in sin. And it says this about the man and the woman before the fall. And they were both naked. The man and his wife and were not ashamed. Now we just uh take a pause here for a second. Brother Paula Fontaine said that I have a a push pause ministry. He says some people have a push play and obey. And he says, "Mine is push pause and ponder, I think, or think think really hard about what he just said. Maybe have time to search it, make sure it's in there." But as we just take a moment to think about this, we hopefully have just seen very quickly about our sinful nature by birth. And then we're kind of looking at, well, how did we get here? And God is, the scriptur is describing here a time when man, even though he's naked, he's not ashamed. And to have no shame, there's no sin. There's no evil. It's only innocence. There there's no there's no stain. &gt;&gt; There's no blush. There's no mark upon them. There's there's no sin. There's no fear. And so, this is that perfect condition that we are not born into. The first man and woman that God set upon the earth, they were born into a perfect condition. As it says in Genesis 1:31, that God looked and said, "It was very good." &gt;&gt; The end of that sixth day, it was very good. This is that sinlessness of creation. He said, "I see no sin. I see no unrighteousness. I see no perversion." But in Genesis 3:13 says, "The Lord God said unto the woman, what is this that thou hast done, sin has entered in, fear enters in upon man, and the woman said, the serpent beguiled me, and I did eat." So this is the this is the at the very beginning their sinlessness. Now, because by one man sin enters into the world, we say that's clearly Adam. Sinless sin enters into the world. And because that death passes upon all of us because we've all sinned, this is the moment we could say that it transitions away from this godly righteousness, this glory of God, this image of God, this sinless perfection upon mankind to fear and sin and shame and nakedness. And the woman says, "The serpent beguiled me and I did eat." Begott means he led me astray. &gt;&gt; I was su I was deceived. The word in the Hebrew is I have been seduced. I had been morally seduced into this an act which she symbolizes by eating. She had been seduced to sin. That's the origin of sin. The origin of sin is in that seduction. And so if we look closely at the fall, it examines how Satan uses or exposes how Satan uses seduction to cause sin. &gt;&gt; I know our minds were thinking, "Oh man, brother Aaron, you could really hit a lot of nasty things we see in Leodysia today and you could really hit it a lot of these lust and things." But and that's true, but there's something there's an undercurrent to all of it. I'll even say it now that many times young men or even our young ladies or any of us if we say something we should and we see something we should and we begin to feel guilty or we feel unclean uh the devil he's definitely trying to get you to do that but what he wants to do is keep that uncleanness in your conscience so it causes you to re withdraw from fellowship &gt;&gt; to not go to church feel reluctant to pray for your children and so there's a way where that's one thing but the real damage of it is the separation it causes from God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And we'll see that very clearly here in the scripture. So, I really feel like I'm in the meat of it. And so, the more you absorb this and indicate you do so, the faster you're going to be able to go to Uncle Ray afterwards. &gt;&gt; And if you if if you don't help me, we they're going to be closed by the time we're done. &gt;&gt; In Genesis 3:1, it says, "Now the serpent was more subtle than any beast of the field which the Lord God had made." So, here's this a subtlety. And he said unto the woman, "Yay, hath God said, you shall not eat of every tree of the garden?" Now this serpent, subtle, cunning, very very intelligent, he speaks and and I I want you to catch the nature of this because this is the first really uh recorded conversation and I can say at least the very first conversation about God. and he says to the woman. So the serpent speaks, he speaks to the woman, and he speaks to the woman what God spoke. Those are three things I want you to recognize. First, the serpent speaks, and then he speaks to the woman, and then when he speaks, he speaks to the woman what God spoke. &gt;&gt; And so he's he's he's interpreting what he says or what he's kind of suggesting. There's a certain interpretation to what God said. Yay. hath God said you shall not eat of every tree of the garden. Now when he uses this phrase yay hath God said he kind of uses this impersonal designation of God kind of this transcendent Elohim. He says yay Elohim hath said so this is the God who in the beginning created but when he says this it's this supernatural being a distant God. So even by his first uh indication and conversation about God, we begin to identify what Satan's trying to do. Yahath Elohim said it's something distant and impersonal. And in Genesis 2:4 though, it says, "These are the generations of the heavens and of the earth when they were created in the day that the Lord God made the he earth and the heavens." So God is not just being indicated as Elohim, but he's Lord God, which is that Jehovah Elohim or Yahweh. It gives God an expression. It's an expression of a covenant God. &gt;&gt; It expresses God in relationship to mankind. We can say Elohim as it relates to rocks and trees and minerals and all sorts of things. Elohim as it relates to Lucifer and all the angels and even the angels that fell. But once God created mankind and established a covenant with them, he's now the Lord God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And and I'm not just being clever with the words here. This is this is nothing but the truth. But Satan initially very cleverly causes distance between God and the woman. &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; He doesn't acknowledge him as being a covenant God. He doesn't acknowledge maybe a closeness. He he doesn't begin to uh uh set the set the scene so she can fully understand that relationship she has with God. But she he kind of tells her he gives this distance in his language which the woman then mirrors in her reaction. &gt;&gt; When she responds, she causes that same distance. She puts that same distance in there. And he's very craftily began the first conversation about God by objectifying God &gt;&gt; by by talking uh talking about God, not to God or with God. Not talking about any kind of uh uh intimacy, but only formally. And that's really what theology is. Theology is talking about God &gt;&gt; where there's no inference of intimacy or relationship with God. When he said what he said, there was no suggestion that there was any in intimacy at all with God. &gt;&gt; In Matthew chapter 26, if you look at this, I think this might help us to understand again the nature of sin and how that it works. As in this we see that there was no in Satan's initial conversation with the w woman he's using a language just to create a little bit of room between you and the lord in Matthew 26 69-74 now Peter sat without in the palace and a damsel came unto him saying thou also was with Jesus of Galilee but he denied before them all saying I know not what thou sayest So now there's just maybe a general denial that oh you were with Jesus like well I don't know what you mean. Maybe you can say well uh I wasn't where you thought I was and whatever the argument might might have been. But he says when he was gone out into the porch another maid saw him and said unto them that were there this fellow was also with Jesus of Nazareth. And again he denied with an oath I do not know the man. Now not only has he said I don't know what you're saying. And in that way, maybe he's kind of softening the denial. Now he says, I don't know the man. There's even a denial of who he is. It's not uh he's not affirming his love and recognition. Thou art the Christ, the son of the living God. No, he's saying, I do not know the man. And after a while came unto him, they they that stood by and said to Peter, Surely thou also art one of them, for thy speech betrayeth thee. Then began he to curse and to swear, saying, "I know not the man." This is his This is his response under pressure. And he's being associated with Jesus in his weakest moment where it appears that this Messiah that they thought would uh uh be their deliverer, things don't look good. And now he's denied him this third time. And immediately the crew. Peter remembered the word of Jesus which said unto him before the cockcrow, "Thou shalt deny me thrice." And he went out and wept bitterly. Deny means to affirm no relationship with. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; To deny means to to affirm no connection with. &gt;&gt; So what was it he did under pressure? He distanced himself from Christ. And why was it he distanced himself from Christ in that moment? Because he didn't fully trust him. Had he really been convinced of who he was, he'd say, "Hey, hey, not going to lie, you had us in the first half, didn't you?" But he knew in that moment, "No, I I I know. I know who he is." If he had known in that moment who he was, he'd said, "Yeah, I was with him. &gt;&gt; I believe he's the son of God. I believe he was called to this purpose." But no, because he wasn't firm in who he believed he was, he denied and caused that separation. And that's where the devil wants to work in any moment or any situation is just cause really if he can just move in such a way to nudge you to get enough enough distance from Christ, you'll do the rest. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; From this moment when he told the woman, wait hasn't Elohim, this transcendent God, this we don't know who he is, this mysterious one, we'll just call him God Allah, this sovereign being, this master of the universe, didn't he say that you shouldn't do this? And that just that was the first push to get the woman thinking about God in an impersonal way to remove that relationship that God had with him so he could begin to seduce her. &gt;&gt; Satan is skilled in this art of seduction. &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; He's skilled at causing one to abandon abandon their allegiance to to uh go slack in their service to lose their discipline. What it is is Satan is just when it comes to art, he's adept at painting a false picture of God. &gt;&gt; So, Brother Brandham likened it to he painted the wrong picture of God. You can go find some of those statements where there he was like this artist who begin to render an image of God that the woman beheld and in that moment she forgot what God really looked like. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Don't you think that happens to us many times? We get into a situation and we may know we're pitiful beings. We now we're convinced tonight if you listen to even one of the scriptures I read that yeah we're born with the stain of sin. We're miserable creatures but that's not what convinces you to fail. That's not what convinces you to make mistakes. See, you're already prone to it. But what will keep you in sin and cause you to get lifted up arrogantly or cause you to constantly stumble is when we forget who God is and what he looks like. &gt;&gt; Amen. What the serpent was able to do through the agency or what Satan was able to do through the agency of the serpent was to deceitfully impregnate that woman's mind with the wrong conception of God. &gt;&gt; Notice this here. He says in Genesis chapter 2 16 and 17. Appreciate your attentiveness tonight. You're doing really good. Uncle Ray is looking really promising. Genesis chapter 2 16 and 17. I'll say this. I know that when I preach there's one comment just about every single time I've been preaching and all these years to this year we're celebrating 20 years of marriage. If I've heard one thing after every time I've preached my wife says that was a lot. Kind of a clever it's a clever commentary, right? A lot of what? Well, we'll just leave it at that. Honey, that was a lot. So, I know even if I just preach 30 minutes, it's going to be a lot. But in Genesis 2 16 and 17, the Lord God commanded the man, saying, "Of every tree of the garden, thou mayest freely eat, but of the tree of knowledge of good and evil, thou shalt not eat of it, for in the day that thou eatest thereof, thou shalt surely die." &gt;&gt; So, what was it that Satan was trying to cause confusion on? The promise. &gt;&gt; And he presented it in a way, and I'm not sure if we're going to get into this in greater detail later, so I'll just kind of say it now. You notice in the language he used with the woman, he says, "But God knows the day you eat, you'll become godlike." So, it was painting this picture of God as being selfish. &gt;&gt; Maybe this picture of God of being vindictive and being inequitable and that God could have given you more, but he didn't. Or he withheld this and you can't really trust him. And so, it's all for the means of painting a picture of God that could just give enough room for you to say, "Wait a minute. Why has he withheld this from us?" &gt;&gt; Amen. But when God says when he commanded the man that of every tree you can freely eat, we could say in some ways that's God commanding freedom. But of the tree of knowledge and good and evil, you can't eat of that or you'll die. You could see that then there's some restriction. But notice and just how I have it summarized on some of these slides that when God said you could eat of all this and that commanded freedom, it was that prohibition that secures their freedom. &gt;&gt; What freedom would it be? you can do whatever you want, but whatever you do, don't jump off this cliff or you won't be able to do whatever you want anymore. Right? It's going to say, "Hey, you can do this, but if you if you violate this, then you're going to lose that privilege because it results in death." So, when he says you may freely eat, he commands freedom. And as free moral agents, they were they they could enjoy this liberty to what? Be fruitful, multiply, replenish the earth, have dominion. These were things that they were as free moral agents allowed to enjoy freely. But when he says, "Thou shalt not eat of the tree of knowledge of good and evil." But let's just think, I want to say deeply, but just really use our uh uh God-given minds and really wrestle with this. When he says you cannot eat, freedom required a restrictive commandment. &gt;&gt; Amen. Right? This is something a lot of times we don't understand that when we we say, "Oh, liberty, liberty, liberty, liberty just means we can do whatever we want." Well, right. Actually, one of the biggest lies I think that's perpetuated anymore is, "Well, where the spirit of the Lord, there's liberty." &gt;&gt; And what they mean, I can blame the spirit for whatever I do in this church service. &gt;&gt; I can blame the spirit for however I act, whatever I do, because where the spirit of the Lord, there's liberty. And it it's just a complete twisting and perverting of the scripture. &gt;&gt; When Paul says where the spirit of the Lord and there is liberty, he means where the spirit of the Lord is, there's now liberty to become Christlike. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We couldn't do it under the law. We couldn't do it by our first nature. But where the spirit of the Lord is, there's liberty to become like Christ. &gt;&gt; Not just act out however you want, &gt;&gt; right? Because we see people who are filled with the Holy Ghost, Holy Spirit, however you want to argue it out. People are genuinely filled with the Holy Spirit and they act one way and another person acts another but neither by that spirit will violate God's word. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And so freedom required a restrictive commandment. &gt;&gt; There must be boundaries or if we say limits in order to have true freedom. &gt;&gt; This is even something that's established in the freest countries in the world. A positive liberty requires negative liberty. &gt;&gt; Don't we do we not have the freedom of speech? But what makes that freedom of speech special that it never infringes upon somebody else's liberties. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; That's what makes it that's what makes it freedom. &gt;&gt; And here when he said the God gave a commandment, this freedom came by accepting and honoring God's boundary. And when mankind mankind lost their freedom when they violated this boundary. And one uh one way to think about this, I think this is just a uh I think we ought to think this about it this way because the spirit of God has made us free from the law of sin and death. So our liberty and our freedom just as it was for them, their freedom was the natural ability to not sin. &gt;&gt; They were not born with the natural ability to sin. &gt;&gt; That wasn't first instinct. &gt;&gt; They had to be seduced into it. &gt;&gt; And we can say, well, the devil seduced me to sin. You start thinking about, well, not really. I just kind of did that, didn't I? &gt;&gt; Didn't even need much proddding. &gt;&gt; You didn't have to be taught it. Didn't even have to learn it. We just are born with it innately. &gt;&gt; That's just something we do instinctively. On the at the men's meeting on Saturday, we were looking at the example of Balum and how that God told Balam, he said, "Hey, whatever you do, don't curse Israel." And so when Balam went back to Bao, he said, "Ah, God told me I can't go with you." But what did he not tell him? I can't curse Israel. &gt;&gt; So he goes back and he seeks the Lord again. And God and the Lord said, "If they come and bid you, go with them." So what's the first thing Balam does the next morning? Saddles his ass and goes to him. &gt;&gt; Doesn't wait. Why? It's just instinctive. He didn't have to be seduced into it. It was own. The Bible says the own greed that worked with him, his own love for wages caused him to get up in the morning, not wait for them to come and seduce him. He deceived himself and he was seduced into going. And it's in there. God said, "Your way is perverse before me." &gt;&gt; So freedom, the real freedom is this natural ability not to sin. And in this after the fall, we've lost that freedom. &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; That's the liberty we've lost. We're born into the world and we come estranged from God speaking lies because we do not have a natural ability to refrain from sin. Romans 7:14 says, "For we know that the law is spiritual, but I am carnal, sold under sin." &gt;&gt; How was it this stain was passed onto mankind? Satan was able to break trust by mischaracterizing God. &gt;&gt; As soon as he was able to mischaracterize God, doubt could arise. &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; Just just give a a little bit of room in her mind in that state was allowed to doubt God. And the woman separated herself from God. And the act that she engaged in was a part of this deliberate dissociation from God. So if we could define sin and distill it down, and I draw this from the message of the hour, there if I'm not using I would hope that to a church this mature that if I never used quotes overtly, you would leave saying, "Man, all he did was quote brother Brandon. just didn't give attribution. Well, I do that for time sake &gt;&gt; because every single thing we're reading here, it's coming. The Bible was coming from the message. &gt;&gt; That's what we get when the message is speaking. The Bible's coming from it. And so, we can we can bring these things right back to the Bible. And so, Brother Bam said sin is unbelief. &gt;&gt; We can prove that absolutely by scripture. So, generally sin can be described in one way as a violation, any violation of God's word, by act, uh by omission. says in 1 John 3:4, "Whosoever committh sin transgresseth also the law, for sin is the transgression of the law." The word there sin means to miss the mark. That's what sin means, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; To simply miss the remark or excuse me, to miss the mark. So sin is a rejection, a rebellion against God's commandment or God's truth. In Genesis 3:11, we see this mirrored in the fall. He said, "Who told thee that thou was naked?" God said, "Hast thou eaten of the tree? Where have I commanded thee that thou shouldest not eat?" Now, when you read this, we we we shouldn't think, "Oh, man. God is so clever to know, so astute, such a good detective to immediately begin to try to follow the breadcrumbs." He knew what happened. &gt;&gt; Amen. But thank God he's not just judging them outright, but he's speaking aloud and it's allowing us to recognize that their nakedness was directly a result of disobeying the commandment &gt;&gt; to not eat of that tree. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So the act that she engaged in was the fruit of this blatant disregard for God's commandment. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Yay. God hath said, "You shall not eat." In that way, it seems as if the serpent has said God did say it's this transcendent distant God said you should cannot eat of any of this fruit of the tree of the garden. But this one who said that said it because he knew when you did you would become more godlike. &gt;&gt; So he said you won't surely die. There was only one way for her to find herself to be naked. That was to disregard God's word. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; As rebellion against truth. 1st Samuel 15:es 22- 24 and Samuel said hath the Lord is great delight in burnt offerings and sacrifices as in obeying the voice of the Lord. &gt;&gt; Behold to obey is better than sacrifice and to hearken than the fat of rams. Yeah, &gt;&gt; this is something really hard to get into our human minds because a lot of times it's that the overt praise or the optics of worship or anything that I can do externally that not only does that impress everybody else, but it impresses us. But really what God wants is he wants obedience. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Doesn't want pretense. He doesn't want politics. He doesn't want personality. He he doesn't want the things that present outwardly. But he says that rebellion is as the sin of witchcraft and stubbornness is as iniquity is as iniquity and idolatry because thou hast rejected the word of the Lord. He hath also rejected thee from being king. And Saul said unto Samuel, I have sinned for I have transgressed the commandment of the Lord and thy words because I feared the people and obeyed their voice. There's some honesty on Saul's part. There's his sin of pride where he was he was afraid of the people. So he sinned, he disobeyed. But Saul's never quite cured of that because immediately he says, "But let's forget about that. Worship with me publicly." So everybody knows we're still tight. So Saul's not absolved here. But he says, "I have transgressed." And Samuel said, "You've rejected the word." He says, "I've transgressed." That Hebrew word is in the sense of missing the target. I've deviated from a right way. I've missed the goal. So sin is rebellion or defiance against God. That pesha there is trespass, rebellion or revolt. The Avon is transgression or something that's twisted or crooked. God is straight. The path is straight. But then when we just twist it or make it crooked just a little bit. I've deviated. That's what sin is. To deviate from God's word. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Joseph recognized it in Genesis 39:9. There's none greater in this house than I. Neither hath he kept back anything from me but they Joseph to Piper's wife. He's acknowledging the goodness of his master towards him and what those boundaries were appropriately within those relationships. He says because thou art his wife. How then can I do this great wickedness and sin against God? This wasn't man's moral law. This wasn't, well, I can't do this to my employer and this wouldn't be right in the eyes of man. He knew that to transgress would be an offense to God. Amen. &gt;&gt; That there's a there's an integrity. There's an uprightness. There's an expectation that God has. There's a way which is called holiness. There's righteousness. There's virtue. There's purity. And there's a way that I can act that's contrary to that. And so sin would be a violation of God's word. Anything that's against the character of God. &gt;&gt; To actually avoid the appearance of evil is to not express anything that mars the image of Christ in flesh. Psalms 51:4 David recognized against thee, thee only have I sinned and done this evil in thy sight, that thou mightest be justified when thou speakest and be clear when thou judges. Sin is not measured by our uh uh our revolt, our you know, our blush against it. Sin is not measured by whether or not there's some uh revulsion on our on our part. Sin is transgression against God. James 4:1 17, therefore to him that knoweth to do good and to doeth it not, to him it is sin. Why? To know to do good and not do it is a lack of respect. &gt;&gt; It's an attitude of indifference, &gt;&gt; whether it be of apathy or lukewarmness or just outright rejection. To know to do right, to know to do good, to know to observe the word of God and to not do it. to you it is sin. What is sin? It's rebellion. It's a lack of respect. It's even overt or it's just this indifference. Well, it doesn't really matter. If it really mattered to God this and say, well, if it really mattered to God, it's in his word. And the word covers quite a bit, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; So perhaps it is sometimes just that indifference or lukewarmness. But in Revelations 3:es 15 and 16, it says, "I know thy works that thou art neither cold nor hot. I would that thou art cold or hot. So then, because thou art lukewarm, and neither cold nor hot, I will spew thee out of my mouth. It's that lukewarmness God hates. &gt;&gt; To be apathetic, to be indifferent. That's it's it's not a matter of just kind of trying to find this this pocket safely where I I don't want to do anything wrong. And since I'm afraid to do anything wrong, I won't try to do anything right. I'm just going to sit here and not do anything at all. That's not going to work. &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; Because sin at its root is unbelief. It's a corruption of It's a corruption of faith in God and his character. &gt;&gt; What worked on the woman, what Peter was experiencing in that moment of denial. Sin at its core is unbelief. It's some disbelief in God and his character. Be maybe our just some of our final principles we want to lay out before we read some statements uh from the message. says, so in 1 John 5 16 and 17. If any man see his brother sin is sin which is not unto death, he shall ask and he shall give him life for them that sin not unto death. There is a sin unto death. I do not say that he shall not pray for it. All unrighteousness is sin and there is a sin not unto death. But what is a sin unto death? I know we'd like to know those categories, right? There's uh right now I'm trying to make sure I eat clean and I'm wanting to get healthy at 50 years old. I want to live long enough to see all my kids grow up. And so there's there's vegetables that are on the okay list. There's vegetables on the limited list and then there's bad vegetables. No, no, no. Don't eat. Right? &gt;&gt; And so here we find that maybe well sin does it have these this is okay and this is not okay and and this is unto death. And so it seems as if it's kind of categorizing things, but there's a lot here to to expand upon. I don't want to get caught up in that. But I do want to identify there is a sin unto death. And unbelief is that sin unto death. &gt;&gt; Because it is the original sin from which all disobedience is born. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The original sin was to what? Distrust, disbelief. It was to accept a lie. It was to no longer have confidence in God. It was to uh through seduction walk across God's boundary. So the sin and death is to disbelieve. &gt;&gt; That is right. &gt;&gt; Is it's that unbelief from which all sin arises. And we understand the the the principle that these there's many things we could say are the attributes of sin. But sin at its core is unbelief. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; John 16 7 to9 he just says it very plainly. Nevertheless, I will tell you the truth. It is expedient for you that I go away. For if I go not away, the comforter will not come unto you. But if I depart, I will send him unto you. And when he has come, he will reprove the world of sin and of righteousness and of judgment. And why will he reprove the world of sin? Verse n of sin because they believe not on me. Here explicitly unbelief is called sin by Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Y &gt;&gt; because unbelief is the root. It's the sap. It's the chief power of all sin. Want to know why we make mistake? We make a mistake. Unbelief's in there somewhere. &gt;&gt; It's the root of it. It's the lifegiving power of sin. Unbelief is actually the head of the serpent that Christ came to crush. &gt;&gt; John 3:36, he that believeth on the Son hath everlasting life, and he that believeth not the Son shall not see life, but the wrath of God abideth on on him. What's the only distinguishing characteristic? Belief versus unbelief. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Where there's unbelief, the wrath of God abides on that one. Where there is belief, there is everlasting life. The wages of sin is death. John 3:36 tells us, "The wages of unbelief is death." It's they're one and the same. &gt;&gt; But the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ. By faith, you're saved, not of works. &gt;&gt; He that believes on the Son of God, &gt;&gt; has everlasting life, &gt;&gt; but he that disbelieves is subject to wrath. John 8:24, I said therefore unto you the that ye shall die in your sins. Well, why? For if you believe not that I am he, ye shall die in your sins. Other words, you cannot disbelieve and be delivered. &gt;&gt; The only thing that'll keep you in sin, the only thing that'll keep you in the grave, the only thing that'll keep you subject to the second death and the dread of standing before white throne judgment is unbelief. Hebrews chapter 3 12-13. Take heed brethren, lest there be in any of you an evil heart of unbelief in departing from the living God. &gt;&gt; That's what causes us to depart. But exhort one another daily why it is called today, lest any of you be hardened through the deceitfulness of sin, &gt;&gt; the delusion of unbelief, &gt;&gt; the seduction of faith faithlessness. There's a delusion to it. Hebrews chapter 3 17 to19. But with whom was he grieved 40 years? Was it not with them that had sinned? Whose carcasses fell in the wilderness? Okay, we know that he was disbelie disappointed in those that sinned. Well, what did it mean to sin? And to whom swear he that they should not enter into his rest, but to them that believed not. So we see that they could not enter in because of unbelief. &gt;&gt; The Bible's very clear on this. &gt;&gt; It wasn't that they fell in the wilderness because of these very specific acts that they may have committed. But God just shows us that all these things were done because they didn't believe. &gt;&gt; What is sin? Sin is disbelief. &gt;&gt; What was their sin? They didn't trust God. &gt;&gt; Sin is a lack of trusting God. Now, that might make it a little bit more personal &gt;&gt; because I found I just testify myself that my biggest problem in life that God has constantly been trying to teach me is to trust him. &gt;&gt; I I look back on my my entire walk and everything that I've ever gone through and every mistake I've made and how I've responded to challenges, at the end of the day, I could say, "I just didn't trust him enough. &gt;&gt; I worried about this. I tried to control that. I didn't trust him." them. And all through everything we're going through, he's teaching us to trust. &gt;&gt; Not to the point to where we say, "Well, God, I don't need your help. I can just keep going. I can do this all alone." No, no, no. He's wanting to teach us that we can trust him. &gt;&gt; That we can believe him. To understand that he does have our best in mind. That he does have thoughts for us to bring us to an expected end. That we don't need to fret. We don't need to worry even when everything is seemingly falling apart. Everything I've tried to do, my marriage, this, that, and everything. Just say, "God, I don't know how, but somewhere in this there is good because you promised me that all things work together for good." What is he doing? Teaching us to trust. &gt;&gt; And where Satan can just nudge us just a little bit to get us off center from trust, that's when the attributes of unbelief begin to manifest. Sin is unbelief. Sin is mistrust. &gt;&gt; There's even a way to define faith is faith is a deliberate confidence in a God whose ways we may not understand. Amen. &gt;&gt; But yeah, we'll deliberately trust. I don't understand what you're doing, but I'm going to trust you anyhow. &gt;&gt; Mark chapter 13 verse 22. Anybody who's familiar maybe with maybe I don't know, maybe this could be a cause for concern if he's just now getting to his text, but you'll probably this probably be a signal. I'm probably coming to my end here of my sermon. Not forecasting the end of life. I'm coming to the end of my sermon. Mark 13:22. For false Christ and false prophets shall rise. So much is intended in that verse. &gt;&gt; False Christ, false prophet shall rise and shall show signs and wonders to seduce, if it were possible, even the elect. Seduction. How it's remarkable that when Christ would warn us of the end time and he would say be careful because in the end false prophets shall rise he doesn't say demonic dogs or demonic disciples or you know witches I mean that would have made more sense right witches and dragons will rise in the last day but he just says false Christs false prophets what makes them false they're claiming to speak on behalf of God what makes them false Christ anointed falsely because of seed I mean this when we run understand what anointed ones at the end time are this is a very humbling scripture very staggering scripture and they'll actually show signs and wonders and this is then attributing to them a means by which our minds may be captured by something beyond ourselves something supernatural and it's all done sedu to seduce God's elect &gt;&gt; and we can be grateful we can thank God &gt;&gt; amen &gt;&gt; that it's impossible to seduce us &gt;&gt; but it doesn't change his efforts &gt;&gt; doesn't change his program what he does is Satan seduces &gt;&gt; this is a lengthy statement but I believe it bears uh an appropriate place here to share with you when brother Baron preaches God hiding himself in simplicity there in April just after the seals were opened he says it's Just like an army going to fight, we got spies in England. England has got spies here. The spies are in and out around the world. They're searching out our military secrets. When we find some kind of a military secret, as soon as they can find it, they take the same thing or something to combat it. It's a warfare. It's kind of that espionage where it's like, well, we found out that they've got this weapon or this technology and they come up with ways to counteract it. And it's uh you know it's fascinating if you drill down to the details of those things of the espionage and the spying and all the games that are played. saw an instance of it not too far long ago where uh Israeli intelligence had bought a contract or bought a provider of digital services and makers of these pagers that were sold into Syria I believe it was or Lebanon and they waited years but at the right moment they were programmed to blow up &gt;&gt; and that's espionage that's that's warfare that's spying and he says the greatest warfare is a spiritual warfare when God knew it was going to come to pass. He did for his children just like the United States does for their army. He gave a man a helmet to wear because he knew he was going to use it. He gave him a spade to dig it with. We know it's going to be We know it's a big pound about 90 lb pack on his back. Some little rookie packing it. He certainly is a hard thing for him. But the army knows they've got to train him for that because he's going to need it. &gt;&gt; Every piece of equipment he's going to need need it when he hits the battlefront. &gt;&gt; Right. And that's what we ought to do today, friend. We got to take the whole word of God because we're going to need it. &gt;&gt; We got to use every word that's in there. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And that's that's good. It's every word that's in there. It's thus sayaith the Lord. And we've got to use the full gospel. &gt;&gt; When God had fortified his church, he fortified it with the best thing that he could find because it's his own children. &gt;&gt; And he fortified the church by the word, his own word. just ask them to believe his word. That's all there was. He doesn't ask you to impersonate it, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; He doesn't ask you to try to manifest it. &gt;&gt; He gives enough to foreshadow it, to express it, to tell you what it's to do. And then we ask that the the life of that word to express itself in us. &gt;&gt; And the only way we can allow it to do that, the first and initial part is to believe the word. Amen. &gt;&gt; Now he says, "And Satan by his wisdom caused Eve to break down that barrier just in one place." Satan admitted every part of the word was right. "But surely you won't die. That's all he had to know." Now, that was the loophole. &gt;&gt; You listening? The loophole. He got Eve from behind the word with one little doubt. What Satan's going to try. This is how we're seduced to sin. Just find the little loophole. &gt;&gt; That's exactly where he gets the church today. The same thing. Just one little doubt brings you on this side. And now there's no way to ever try to think that God would spare you through belonging to a church, belonging to an organization or a group or whatever it is or any sensation. A lot of sensationalism anymore. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Right. There's Listen, one thing we can know for sure that if it's a church age spirit, it's going to cycle because that's what a church age spirit is. It's a cycle of revival and death. Try one thing, when it dies, try another. Try when the spirit kind of peters out, go to another. Always trying to keep the people's attention. Church ages are indicated by cycles of revival and death. And so it tends to swing from intellectualism to emotionalism, intellectualism to emotional. just a constant cycle &gt;&gt; or any sensation. He says you've got to believe his word and act upon the same. &gt;&gt; That's the only way. That's God's program at the beginning. That's God's program down through the life. What is it? You've got to believe his word &gt;&gt; and act upon the same. That's God's program at the beginning. That's God's program down through the life. That's God's program now. The church must stay behind the word. That's the only way that he or that you can be safe. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Listen, I say this as we close. The musicians could come to their instruments. The only place you're safe is behind the word. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And Satan on in daily life, everyday life, is going to try to seduce you outside of that protection. &gt;&gt; And we could think, well, he's going to get he's going to try to draw me out. But what was it when Brother Bam said, "If he can just get you to disbelieve your weapon, Right? &gt;&gt; Disbelief is powerful enough. &gt;&gt; So you just look at it and just enough time to let the shield down, take the ham helmet off and start examining it to not believe. Sin is that distrust. That moment where you you're not trusting God. That moment where you begin to say, "Well, I I don't know if his word is true. I don't know if this promises for me. I don't know if he'll do this for me. I' i've made this mistake. I've done that. Maybe it's too late." And that's all it takes for the loophole &gt;&gt; to show its show its way. Right? &gt;&gt; Stay behind the word. That's the only way that you can be safe. &gt;&gt; That's what Satan is going to do. That's his tactic. He says, &gt;&gt; Satan caused Eve to break down that barrier just in one place. He made her do it. And in the conflict between God and Satan, brother Bam says it this way. Just if you could just begin to think prayerfully now. He says, "Now Satan in this time set up the same system that he did in the Garden of Eden, reasoning against the word of these prophets." &gt;&gt; He said, "Satan set him up a system." He asked the question, "What was it to combat the word of the Lord that came to the prophets?" He uses that same old tactic every time. God stays with his same the word. What the devil's going to try to do is attack the word. Attack the word. &gt;&gt; Say, well, can't really destroy the word. The word's eternal. So, where does it where does the word where how can the word then lose its effect is if we just slightly doubt. That creates the loophole. Satan's system is reasoning against the word to combat the word and it's his tactic. But God stays the same, the word. How can we be seduced to sin? Just disbelief. &gt;&gt; How is it that we continue in patterns of uh behavior that are displeasing, that are destructive, a lack of trust? &gt;&gt; Maybe we don't want to trust them. Maybe we want to have an excuse to stay the way we are. Maybe we like the pretense of things. Maybe we've gotten so good at c quieting that voice of God that speaks to us and say, you know, this isn't right. You know, this isn't right. That tonight is the night to shake ourselves, to recognize we're being lulled to sleep. &gt;&gt; We're being seduced to sin. Let's stand together. Let's pray together. It's these nights can get late very quickly, almost 9:00. But we do want to pray for you that God would just help us in our hearts as we consider these things. Say, 'Lord, maybe that could be your prayer. If you want to just raise your hand, say, ' Lord, I don't want to fall for one of Satan's loopholes. I don't want to be taking the loophole. If you're a tax attorney or an accountant, you try to find loopholes for your client's sake. Don't let the devil advocate for a loophole. God's closed all the loopholes. If Satan's trying to show you one, it's a path to death and destruction. Our gracious heavenly father, tonight as we close this service in prayer, just this portion and turn it over to the pastor, though there may have been some levity, no doubt some swiftness to the delivery tonight, it's a very simple thought that sin is unbelief and that it's not as overt and obvious sometimes as we think it is, but it's seduction. And at its core, what the devil is trying to do is just create a little bit of a loophole where we find our own reason to not trust God. And I pray, Lord, that if anything could happen tonight, we just button up those areas where there's slack. Really challenge ourselves at our core to say, "Am I taking God at his word? Am I believing his word? &gt;&gt; Am I willing to walk behind that word? Am I willing to embrace it?" Lord, the devil bluffs us and intimidates us and tries to get us to deny comm affiliation to your word or to deny any kind of relationship or commitment. The devil still yet tries to create an impersonal God who's far away who's not interested all for the sake of allowing us to follow after our own lust. I pray that you would heal us of this disease of unbelief. &gt;&gt; That Lord, wherever we're weak, strengthen us as that one cried out, Lord, I believe. Help thou my unbelief. What a what a testimony to say, Lord, I I do trust you, but maybe not fully. I do believe you, but there's areas where I'm weak, and I believe there's victory tonight in acknowledging I can do better. Lord, forgive me. I've sinned and I've sinned against you. I haven't trusted you like I should. Lord, I know there's still maybe a lot to be desired in this. And if you give Liberty, we could follow up on it next Wednesday, but I trust that tonight could be fruitful in the hearts of the believers. Something to think about as they go. We commit them to you in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; God bless you. We love you. Happy to be here, brother John. &gt;&gt; We appreciated that word. &gt;&gt; Amen. the way that it was so presented that we could precisely see the enemy at the very root of our sins at the very beginning. &gt;&gt; But you know, we are not all real keen when we slip and fall. &gt;&gt; It's usually we're recognizing it after. But here's the the beautiful thing about grace. Grace is as soon as you recognize it, get back, right? Get back. Don't stay there. &gt;&gt; And I believe that God has given us all that opportunity so we don't have to maybe I know we've been admonished today to pay attention to the devil when he comes, but what I'm saying is if you miss that and you find that you fall, quickly get back up and say, "Lord, I'm sorry. help me to be more aware, more keen uh for next time. And I believe that that that is the elect. The elect is going to be moving in that direction. I appreciated that message very very much. Thinking about trust. Job said, "Though he slay me, yet I trust him." And that's our end. We just have to we have to trust the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's sing. I've got a revelation. Just take a moment. Just water the word. I've got a revelation of predestination. I've got a revelation. God is my father. Know where I came from tells me where I'm going. And the gates of hell can never prevail against it. I've got a revelation of predestination. I've got a revelation. God is my father. I know where I came from. Tells me where I'm going. And the gates of hell can never prevail against it. Amen. Let's sing. Yes, I know. Come ye sers lost and hopeless. Jesus blood can make you free. For he saved the worst among you when he saved a wretch like me. And I know, yes, I know Jesus blood can make the vilest sinner clean. And I know, yes, I know Jesus blood can make the vilest sinner clean. To the faint he giveth power through the mountains makes a way. Findeth water in the desert turns the night to golden day. And I know, yes, I know Jesus blood can make the vilest sinner clean. And I know, yes, I know. Oh, Jesus blood can make the vilest sitter. In temptation, he is near. He holds the power of hell at bay. Guide you to the path of safety. Gives you grace for every day. And I know, yes, I know Jesus blood can make the vilest sinner clean. And I know, yes, I know Jesus blood can make the vilest sinner clean. He will keep me while the ages grow throughout eternity. For things hell ragees all must work for good to thee. And I know yes I know Jesus blood can make the vowest sinner please. And I know, yes, I know Jesus blood can make the vilest sinner clean. Amen. There's a fountain &gt;&gt; flowing for us. Amen. I just want to sing one more if we could. Just kind of this theme that we heard today. Trust and obey. Trust and obey. Learning to trust the Lord. When we walk with the Lord in the light of his word, what a glory he sheds on his way. While we do his good will, he abides with us still and with all who will trust and oy. Trust and oy for there's no other way to be happy in Jesus. [Music]
