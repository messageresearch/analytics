[42:44] amen hallelujah I want to read now from
[42:46] Mark chapter 4 starting at verse 35
[42:49] appreciate each one coming
[42:58] the Bible says
[43:00] this and the same day when Eden was
[43:04] come he said unto them let us pass over
[43:07] unto the other side and when they had
[43:09] sent away the multitude they took him
[43:11] even as he was in the ship and there
[43:13] were also with him other little
[43:16] ships and there arose a great storm of
[43:19] wind and the waves beat into the ship so
[43:21] that it was now full and he was in the
[43:24] hinder part of the ship asleep on a
[43:26] pillow and they awake him and said unto
[43:28] him
[43:29] Master carest thou not that we perish
[43:33] amen but he cares yes I'm so glad he
[43:37] cares am amen and he arose and rebuked
[43:40] the wind and said unto the sea peace be
[43:42] still and the wind ceased and there was
[43:45] a great calm amen and he said unto them
[43:49] why are you so fearful and how is it
[43:54] that you have no faith amen and they
[43:57] feared exceedingly saying one to another
[43:59] what manner of man is this that even the
[44:02] wind and the Sea obey him amen he's our
[44:08] God Amen Let Us bow our heads I want to
[44:10] speak to you for a few minutes this
[44:11] evening on where is
[44:14] he where is
[44:16] he Heavenly
[44:21] Father we are so glad to call you father
[44:25] amen and we thank you Lord for all that
[44:28] you've done for us amen and we commit
[44:31] this
[44:32] congregation Thy word and ourself into
[44:34] your hands amen For Your Glory in Jesus
[44:38] name thank you Lord and the Saints said
[44:40] amen amen God bless you you may be
[44:43] seated I want to call your attention
[44:45] back to verse
[44:46] 40 where he said and he said unto them
[44:50] why are ye so fearful and how is it that
[44:54] you have no faith amen so faith and fear
[44:59] really can't coexist that's right and as
[45:02] I was thinking about this scripture on
[45:04] fear and faith it reminded me of
[45:06] something that the prophet said brother
[45:09] B said I thought tonight that I would
[45:11] talk on faith for a little while just to
[45:13] build up on Christian faith he said I
[45:16] find out that one of the greatest
[45:18] hindrances that the church has got today
[45:21] is that they're scared to death amen and
[45:24] what are you scared about that's what
[45:25] I'm wondering if you just only realize
[45:29] who you are you don't know who you are
[45:33] and you don't know who that is sitting
[45:35] next to you you say yeah that's my
[45:37] neighbor I know him all right but you
[45:39] see he's a Son of God see that's right
[45:41] adopted by Jesus Christ into the family
[45:43] and that's a daughter of God sitting
[45:45] next to you amen and who are you if
[45:48] you're a Christian a Believer you're a
[45:51] son and daughter of God then what are
[45:53] you scared about there's no need of
[45:55] being scared as long as the devil can
[45:58] keep you scared that's all he wants to
[46:03] do he's got you right then amen all he
[46:07] wants to do as long as he can keep you
[46:10] scared that's all he wants to do he's
[46:14] got you right then amen so then we
[46:18] understand that Amnesia of not knowing
[46:20] who you are feeds fear amen I lost my
[46:25] daddy a few year ago to
[46:28] Alzheimer's and Alzheimer's is a cruel
[46:30] disease it is because you lose them
[46:33] twice that's right you lose them before
[46:36] you ever lose them that's right amen and
[46:39] we the last little bit of my daddy's
[46:41] life we had to put him into a
[46:42] Alzheimer's home where they was able to
[46:45] take care of him and they were having a
[46:47] little party for the patients or the the
[46:50] residents of the home and so I go to be
[46:53] with my daddy and he wasn't able to walk
[46:55] at that time and we wrote put him out
[46:57] into a wheelchair and they were passing
[46:59] out little
[47:01] gifts and they said James
[47:05] Ward and my daddy never
[47:10] answered cuz he didn't know who he was
[47:14] amen and I said Daddy you better raise
[47:17] up here buddy they've got a present for
[47:19] you they got a gift for you it's got
[47:21] your name on it it belongs to you but he
[47:24] never answered
[47:28] because he didn't know who he was amen
[47:31] and you say why do you say that because
[47:34] I want you to
[47:37] understand that no matter how great the
[47:40] services are when he would come service
[47:43] after service and call your name through
[47:46] his word and no matter how great the
[47:48] Revelation would be and no matter how
[47:50] rich the anointing is if you don't
[47:54] recognize it's for you am it'll do you
[47:57] no good the gift that stands behind the
[48:00] pulpit that God that gift in that man's
[48:02] life the gift in brother John's life is
[48:05] not for himself it's for you amen and if
[48:08] you don't recognize that gift that God
[48:11] has placed among you it'll do you no
[48:14] good amen not knowing who you are feeds
[48:18] fear if you've been around an
[48:19] Alzheimer's patient sometimes they get
[48:21] violent because they don't understand
[48:24] what someone's trying to do for them and
[48:27] so they strike out because of fear
[48:30] because they don't know who they are so
[48:33] Amnesia feeds fear but realizing who you
[48:37] are produces Faith
[48:40] amen Jesus had perfect Faith because he
[48:44] knew who he was in the
[48:46] word you know I heard a story one time
[48:49] of a beggar that was laying in the
[48:51] street and an artist came by and he
[48:54] stopped and he said to the man he said
[48:56] can I paint you portrait I'll give you a
[48:58] few bucks if you allow me to paint your
[49:01] portrait and the bum lady in the gutter
[49:03] said sure So the man painted the
[49:06] portrait and when he got done he handed
[49:08] the bum some money and he started to
[49:10] leave and the beggar said can I see the
[49:13] painting if you painted me I would like
[49:16] to see what it looks like so the artist
[49:19] turns the portrait around and in this
[49:22] portrait is a man that's well dressed
[49:24] every hair is in place clean well
[49:28] shaven just just like a prince of a man
[49:32] and the beggar laid in the street he
[49:33] said who is
[49:35] that and the artist said That's you and
[49:39] he said that's me and the artist said
[49:42] well that's the way I see
[49:45] you and the beggar said if that's the
[49:48] man you see then that's the man I'll be
[49:51] and he raised up and straightened
[49:53] himself and walked down the road and oh
[49:55] I say tonight if we could see ourselves
[49:58] the way God sees us we see our
[50:01] weaknesses we see our fa come on
[50:03] somebody we see our failures and many
[50:06] times that's what the devil wants you to
[50:08] see but if you can see yourself the way
[50:11] God sees you because when God looks at
[50:13] us he sees us through the blood of the
[50:15] Lamb amen and our sacrifice was perfect
[50:19] there was no flaw in
[50:21] him oh glory to God hallelujah oh see
[50:26] yourself tonight the way the word sees
[50:28] you he said you're sinless the perfect
[50:31] Hallelujah bride of Jesus
[50:34] Christ perfect love cast out all fear
[50:37] and love and faith is the same thing see
[50:40] love perfect love cast out all fear
[50:42] which gives you Faith then let us come
[50:44] tonight with this revelation of who we
[50:48] are we are not a cult though they try to
[50:51] make us one we are not an organization
[50:54] we are not a denomination
[50:57] right we are his
[51:00] body represented on the earth tonight B
[51:04] of his bone flesh of his flesh Spirit of
[51:06] his Spirit life of his life
[51:08] amen then let our faith in him cast out
[51:11] off all fear amen now we open our
[51:15] scriptures we find that Jesus is telling
[51:18] his disciples to get into the boat and
[51:20] let us pass over to the other
[51:23] side now where are they going to the
[51:26] other side why he said so amen he
[51:31] amen that's right amen that's right now
[51:34] the reason they're making this journey
[51:35] across the water is because on the other
[51:38] side is gadera and there is a man who's
[51:41] living among the tombs who's known as
[51:43] the maniac of gadera amen amen there's a
[51:48] bunch of them in
[51:52] Michigan and he's crying out for help
[51:56] yes he was wanting
[51:59] Deliverance oh my amen so Jesus got into
[52:04] the ship and he crossed the stormy sea
[52:07] that night for the call of one needy
[52:11] Soul amen you see it don't take a church
[52:15] full amen it don't take a well if
[52:17] there's a 100 I'll show up tonight
[52:19] that's not what he said what two or
[52:21] three are gathered in my name I will be
[52:24] in their
[52:25] midst so let
[52:27] tonight one sincere soul in this
[52:29] building can call him on the scene
[52:33] tonight amen he crossed all the way over
[52:36] into gadera to give Mercy to one
[52:40] man and I say tonight if there's only
[52:43] one in this building who gets Mercy
[52:45] tonight God let it be
[52:49] me when my daughter was was injured in
[52:52] the accident two of my family was killed
[52:54] and was hit by the train many of has
[52:56] seen the video and when she came home
[52:58] from the hospital we invited brother
[53:01] Billy Paul brother brenham's son down to
[53:03] the church for her
[53:07] homecoming and when the service was over
[53:09] and we were outside and Jessica was just
[53:12] threey old so I had her up in my arms
[53:15] and I I asked brother Billy I said
[53:17] brother Billy would you pray for Jessica
[53:20] and I just handed her to him and he took
[53:21] her up in his arms and he prayed for my
[53:23] daughter and he handed her back to me
[53:25] and he said this to brother Paul and
[53:27] it's always stayed with me he said
[53:29] brother Daryl daddy said in every
[53:31] meeting there's always one great miracle
[53:34] takes place he said this weekend that
[53:37] Miracle is your daughter amen but I
[53:40] thought so many times if there's only
[53:42] one Miracle takes place in this building
[53:45] tonight let it be me Lord you are to
[53:47] come with that attitude if you is the
[53:49] only one in need Hallelujah if he was
[53:52] the only one ever sick he would have
[53:53] took the stripes on his back for your
[53:55] healing if he was the only one ever lost
[53:57] he would have died on the cross to
[53:59] forgive you of your
[54:01] sins that's how much he cares for you
[54:03] but you let the devil lie to you and
[54:06] tell you there's no hope for you that's
[54:07] a
[54:11] lie amen Lord it always made amazing me
[54:14] people can tell you everything the devil
[54:16] told them that week and they can't quote
[54:18] one good Bible verse that's right that's
[54:21] right I say it's time you quit listening

[54:42] setting in a Humble Church the same one
[54:45] he'll every time come to where he's
[54:47] wanted but he'll never come to where
[54:50] he's doubted that's right that's why
[54:52] some people when they come to church
[54:54] they seiz God every service because
[54:57] their faith can declare that he's here
[54:59] others come and never see him because
[55:02] their faith cannot declare but I'm tell
[55:04] you he's here the word says he's
[55:07] here well I don't feel it he never said
[55:09] did you feel it but he did say did you
[55:12] believe it if you start believing it you
[55:14] might feel
[55:15] it
[55:18] right Hallelujah he'll every time come
[55:21] to where he's wanted but he'll never

[55:59] the sea then what got Jesus attention it

[59:41] brewing he knew the winds would pick up
[59:43] but he also knew the word would carry
[59:46] them

[1:00:02] storm I'm not sure what the greatest
[1:00:04] category of a hurricane is but say it's
[1:00:06] C category five this was probably like a
[1:00:09] seven or an
[1:00:11] eight and this man knows that a
[1:00:14] hurricane category 8 Storm is Coming

[1:00:38] father for the word says in Proverbs
[1:00:41] 3:24 when thou liest down Thou shalt not
[1:00:45] be afraid yeay Thou shalt lie down and

[1:00:58] might not be a hurricane but there is a
[1:01:00] storm brewing in this
[1:01:03] nation in this fearful time when people
[1:01:05] are so nervous that they can't even
[1:01:08] sleep sleeping pill cells are through
[1:01:10] the roof yet we have the promise that no
[1:01:13] matter how dark it is how evil it is how
[1:01:16] violent it is how great the storm is
[1:01:18] come on now he said when you lay down
[1:01:21] your sleep can be
[1:01:24] sweet
[1:01:26] amen go to sleep go to sleep go to sleep
[1:01:32] little bride don't you worry I am with
[1:01:36] you I'll be here till you
[1:01:41] rise amen praise the Lord just go to
[1:01:43] sleep not now but when the service is
[1:01:49] over just seeing if you're still
[1:01:53] awake he lays down to go to sleep
[1:01:58] knowing the storm is coming but he
[1:01:59] wasn't worried he wasn't nervous because
[1:02:01] he knew the storm oh I like this the
[1:02:04] storm did not control him that's right
[1:02:07] he controlled the
[1:02:09] [Music]
[1:02:10] storm Hallelujah remember who's in
[1:02:14] charge Our God has never lost control
[1:02:18] that's right that's right hallelujah
[1:02:20] amen you know and it seems like it we
[1:02:23] find it every time we try to do
[1:02:25] something for the Lord when you try to
[1:02:27] help someone or try to draw closer to
[1:02:29] God walking in obedience it's those
[1:02:32] times that it seems like the devil
[1:02:34] always tries to bring barriers or
[1:02:37] hindrances or snags you know what I'm
[1:02:39] talking about your phone not go off all
[1:02:41] day and you go in the prayer closet to
[1:02:42] pray
[1:02:47] and you think how did he know
[1:02:50] that it seems like every time and I was
[1:02:53] telling we was talking about
[1:02:57] me and brother martin I had a little got
[1:02:59] a little dry mouth there for a second me
[1:03:01] and brother martin we was talking about
[1:03:02] it yesterday I think it was that in a
[1:03:05] racetrack you know when they put those
[1:03:06] horses in behind that gate and Clos that
[1:03:09] gate do you know what that Gate's called
[1:03:11] it's called the
[1:03:13] barrier and the barrier is put there to
[1:03:16] keep the horses from jumping the gun
[1:03:19] that's right so it's a barrier to hold
[1:03:21] them back but the evidence that there's
[1:03:24] a barrier proves proves that there's a
[1:03:26] victory line amen if there was no
[1:03:29] Victory line there would be no barrier
[1:03:31] so when Satan tries to bring barriers
[1:03:33] when he tries to bring snakes that's the
[1:03:36] evidence that there's the victory laying
[1:03:38] ahead for
[1:03:40] you don't get discouraged well I'm
[1:03:42] trying to serve the Lord and this
[1:03:43] happened and that's happened that's just
[1:03:45] part of the course but remember that's
[1:03:48] the evidence you're moving in the right
[1:03:50] direction amen amen hallelujah the Bible
[1:03:53] says the thief cometh to steal and kill
[1:03:55] the destroy do you know a thief will
[1:03:57] never Rob someone who's got less than
[1:04:04] them about it is that not true what kind
[1:04:07] of thief would rob somebody that ain't
[1:04:09] got no
[1:04:10] money so what do they look for they look
[1:04:13] for somebody that they think's got some
[1:04:15] money and why is the devil attacking you
[1:04:18] because he sees there's value to your
[1:04:20] life
[1:04:25] L
[1:04:27] hallelujah amen Lord do you love him
[1:04:29] tonight amen it's them times when we try
[1:04:33] to draw closer to God that snags come
[1:04:35] and hindrances come and storms begin to
[1:04:38] like Moses when God told him when you
[1:04:41] bring my children out bring them to this
[1:04:44] mountain and they shall worship me here
[1:04:48] amen now where are they going to worship
[1:04:49] God on the mountain why he said so amen
[1:04:53] but notice he told Moses you go down
[1:04:56] there and tell Pharaoh thus sayith the
[1:04:58] Lord Israel is my
[1:05:01] son you see he never come to steal
[1:05:04] Pharaoh's slaves he come to he come to
[1:05:08] redeem his
[1:05:12] own hallu so God's desire was for Israel
[1:05:16] to worship him on this mountain amen so
[1:05:19] here they go after oh my and if you
[1:05:22] study it you'll find out that the 10
[1:05:24] most favorable gods of Egypt was the 10
[1:05:27] plagues that sent to Egypt God trumped
[1:05:30] every one of their gods with the plague
[1:05:33] showing he was the true and only
[1:05:36] Goden so they come out let Egypt's Gods
[1:05:39] literally
[1:05:40] destroyed and here they are in a Revival
[1:05:43] wow and where do they come to where are
[1:05:47] they supposed to be going they're going
[1:05:48] to the mountain but where do they come
[1:05:51] to a sea right amen
[1:05:56] yes think about that for a minute if God
[1:05:58] said my desire is for you to worship me
[1:06:00] on this mountain why the Red
[1:06:03] Sea why the
[1:06:07] hindrance so they come to the Red Sea
[1:06:09] and there's desert on one side Mountain
[1:06:10] to the other and here comes Pharaoh's
[1:06:12] Army behind them right but Moses had a
[1:06:16] commission from God bring my children to
[1:06:18] this mountain that means anything that
[1:06:20] stands in the way you have a right to
[1:06:23] speak to it
[1:06:26] and he said Moses why cry unto me
[1:06:30] speak Hallelujah hallu and the water
[1:06:33] parted and they went across on dry
[1:06:36] ground no oh my God not only did God
[1:06:39] split the water he dried up the ground
[1:06:42] he didn't even want their shoes to get
[1:06:45] [Music]
[1:06:47] muddy and the water closed and destroyed
[1:06:50] Pharaoh's Army and marryam and the
[1:06:52] sisters grabbed tambores and up and down
[1:06:54] the bank they went shouting and praising
[1:06:57] God amen amen that's right and where did
[1:07:01] they go into a desert amen three days
[1:07:06] with no
[1:07:08] water now the first day with no water is
[1:07:11] bearable second day it's getting pretty
[1:07:13] rough by the third day you about ready
[1:07:16] to kill somebody for water I'm just
[1:07:18] being honest you're so thirsty you can't
[1:07:19] stand it that's right so three days in
[1:07:22] the desert with no water and all of a
[1:07:24] sudden the animals begin to smell water
[1:07:26] and they begin to try to break ranks and
[1:07:28] the children they realize somebody else
[1:07:32] water and the kids begin to run and the
[1:07:35] the animals break ranks and begin to run
[1:07:37] and they get to the water just three
[1:07:39] days off like oh
[1:07:43] just amen get back get
[1:07:48] back it's bitter
[1:07:51] amen we can't drink it
[1:07:55] you Paul would have been almost
[1:07:58] better to find no water at all right
[1:08:01] than to find
[1:08:03] water and can't drink it
[1:08:08] amen and the Very ones who shouted and
[1:08:11] danced up and down the bank of the Red
[1:08:15] Sea now begin to complain that's right
[1:08:19] what are we going to do for water
[1:08:21] Moses you brought us out here ain't it
[1:08:25] something how soon they forgot the Red
[1:08:28] Sea Revival amen that's right and the
[1:08:31] thing about it is amen the thing about
[1:08:34] it is if God fixed one water
[1:08:37] problem on now can he fix all water
[1:08:40] problems that's right amen amen the Red
[1:08:43] Sea was a water problem God fixed it
[1:08:47] they cried out to God God said Moses cut
[1:08:49] that tree down throw it in the water and
[1:08:51] The Bitter Water became
[1:08:54] sweet then why why would God allow it to
[1:08:56] begin with because I believe that
[1:08:58] sometimes God makes the water so bitter
[1:09:01] that there's nowhere else to look but
[1:09:03] him that's right amen amen you see if
[1:09:07] they would have drunk the water they
[1:09:08] might have say well thank you Lord
[1:09:09] that's really good you know how we kind
[1:09:11] of do in a service you
[1:09:14] know but when oh God but when the water
[1:09:17] was so bitter they couldn't drink it and
[1:09:19] then God made it sweet I'd say there was
[1:09:21] another sweet water revival
[1:09:25] amen hallelujah sir well what I'm saying
[1:09:29] this they was going towards the mountain
[1:09:30] than anything that stood in their way
[1:09:32] they had a right to speak and go
[1:09:35] forward amen amen he never told Moses
[1:09:39] not one time to go
[1:09:42] back we are not to retreat that's that's
[1:09:46] right amen if you study the Christian
[1:09:48] armor there is no armor in the back
[1:09:52] that's right because God has never
[1:09:55] commissioned his people to turn
[1:09:59] back we are going
[1:10:01] forward well brother Daryl this happened
[1:10:03] we're going forward where they're saying
[1:10:05] this we're going
[1:10:06] forward amen amen Lord hallelujah you
[1:10:10] know I was in Army I know brother Bill
[1:10:12] you in the Army Vietnam thank you for
[1:10:13] your service buddy I was in the Army
[1:10:15] joined my parents signed for me when I
[1:10:17] was 16 and I went on active duty when I
[1:10:19] 17y old now we was raised poor and I
[1:10:24] always wanted to see the world
[1:10:26] so they say join the Army see the world
[1:10:29] so I joined the army for two reasons one
[1:10:31] to see the world the other to get the GI
[1:10:33] bill because they were phasing it out
[1:10:35] and the GI bill would pay for my college
[1:10:37] which it did when I got out of school I
[1:10:38] used the GI Bill and become a surgical
[1:10:40] technician assisted doctors in surgery
[1:10:42] for
[1:10:43] years so when I was in the Army I joined
[1:10:46] you know for those two reasons and when
[1:10:48] I got out of basic training in Fort S
[1:10:49] Oklahoma you know where they sent me
[1:10:52] Fort Brag North
[1:10:53] Carolina 6 hour hours from
[1:10:56] home I spent my whole military career 6
[1:11:00] hours from
[1:11:03] home you can't make that
[1:11:07] up so when I got out of the army the
[1:11:10] United States Army when I was there oh
[1:11:13] my and brother Bill you can test father
[1:11:16] this they gave us a steel pot we call it
[1:11:18] a steel pot combat helmet they gave us
[1:11:20] combat boots they gave me an M16 rifle
[1:11:23] with a 32 round banana clip if I
[1:11:25] remember
[1:11:27] right they gave
[1:11:31] me a
[1:11:33] backpack to carry my stuff in in combat
[1:11:38] they gave me an m203 grenade launcher
[1:11:42] that attached underneath my M16 rifle
[1:11:45] now the reason they gave me that grenade
[1:11:48] launcher lot people don't even know what
[1:11:50] it is they've never heard of it I cared
[1:11:51] it the whole time I was in the Army but
[1:11:53] the reason it did I at on the rifle
[1:11:54] range sighten in the rifle and the drill
[1:11:57] sergeant looked at me and said you'll be
[1:11:59] the grenade
[1:12:01] launcher you don't have to be close just
[1:12:03] accurate you don't have to be accurate
[1:12:05] just
[1:12:07] close so I carried it the whole time I
[1:12:09] was in the Army I was on a 55 Houser
[1:12:12] that could fire a projectile 101 lb
[1:12:14] projectile 18 miles on a charge 8 green
[1:12:18] bag I lost my hearing being on that gun
[1:12:21] I have very poor hearing because of it
[1:12:24] all this the army gave me to defend this
[1:12:26] country but there's one thing the Army
[1:12:28] never gave me you know what that was the
[1:12:30] promise of a
[1:12:32] victory they just gave me the equipment
[1:12:34] to fight with no promise of a victory
[1:12:37] that's right so when I got when I got
[1:12:40] out of the United States Army in
[1:12:42] December the 21st 1981 I got into God's
[1:12:45] Army amen praise the Lord and since I
[1:12:48] got into God's Army I've been in 32
[1:12:51] countries I just found out I was in the
[1:12:54] wrong Army
[1:12:55] amen amen amen but when I got into God's
[1:12:58] Army you know what I found out he gave
[1:13:00] me equipment he gave me the helmet of
[1:13:02] salvation he shot my feet with the
[1:13:04] preparation of the Gospel he gave me the
[1:13:06] shield of faith and the sword of the
[1:13:07] word but there's one thing that God gave
[1:13:09] me oh my that the United States Army
[1:13:11] never gave me you know what that was a
[1:13:13] promise of a
[1:13:15] victory Hallelujah God says look in the
[1:13:18] back of the book we win we
[1:13:23] win amen thank you Lord
[1:13:26] hallelujah yes sir yes sir amen amen if
[1:13:29] you've done all you can do keep going
[1:13:31] forward doctor says you can't get well
[1:13:33] keep going forward
[1:13:35] amen hallelujah hallelujah Don't Turn
[1:13:38] back amen speak and go forward Jesus
[1:13:42] said let us go over to the other side he
[1:13:45] had a job to do tired and weary he lays
[1:13:47] down to rest knowing he's in the will of
[1:13:49] the father moving forward across the sea
[1:13:52] to the maniac of gadera now here's the I
[1:13:55] hope I'm not taking too much time here's
[1:13:57] the disciples now they're moving across
[1:13:59] this this sea and they were in the
[1:14:01] message of the
[1:14:03] hour amen they had with them
[1:14:06] Jesus the
[1:14:07] messenger a Revival they was in a
[1:14:11] Revival sitting there testifying of all
[1:14:13] the things they seen him do amen it
[1:14:17] should be smooth saing that's right no
[1:14:20] worries no bumps were his disciples we
[1:14:24] moving with him
[1:14:26] it should be everything should be a
[1:14:30] picnic there's only one thing wrong with
[1:14:33] that he never promised that that's right
[1:14:37] he didn't and remember he keeps all his
[1:14:40] promises that's right he never said we
[1:14:44] wouldn't have trials he never said we
[1:14:47] wouldn't suffer he never said we
[1:14:49] wouldn't be laughed at made fun of he
[1:14:51] never said we wouldn't be called a cult
[1:14:53] come on somebody he never promised
[1:14:55] smooth saem he never said there wouldn't
[1:14:57] be storms he never said we wouldn't cry
[1:15:00] he never said we wouldn't bury loved
[1:15:01] ones he never said that but he did say
[1:15:06] I'll never leave thee nor will I forsake
[1:15:08] thee then no matter what I face brother
[1:15:10] Paul no matter how great the trial is no
[1:15:13] matter how great the storm is I do not
[1:15:16] face it
[1:15:18] alone he is with
[1:15:22] me yes sir amen amen he said he said let
[1:15:28] us go over to the other side so as
[1:15:31] they're sailing across the sea the storm
[1:15:34] begins to blow in now Peter being a
[1:15:37] seasoned fisherman you know Peter he
[1:15:39] must have been some
[1:15:41] character being a seasoned fisherman you
[1:15:43] said now boys I've been out here on this
[1:15:45] water before I know all about it see
[1:15:47] that right
[1:15:50] there so he had this
[1:15:52] attitude and sometimes it's I heart it's
[1:15:55] hard to say but it's the truth sometimes
[1:15:57] we find this attitude among message
[1:16:00] people I can do this myself I don't need
[1:16:03] nobody I don't need no help but you know
[1:16:07] sometimes it's good to be honest when
[1:16:09] we're going through a trial to be honest
[1:16:11] and go to God and say God I need
[1:16:18] help he said in his word if you call
[1:16:21] unto me I will answer thee amen amen you
[1:16:26] talk about a calling plan that's a good
[1:16:28] calling plan that ain't
[1:16:30] G come on somebody that ain't AT&T
[1:16:33] that's
[1:16:35] God call unto me and I will answer
[1:16:41] thee but Peter with this seasoned
[1:16:43] fisherman with this attitude boys I've
[1:16:45] got this in all his ability as a Sean oh
[1:16:49] don't worry I've got this right
[1:16:51] here but he didn't have it no he didn't
[1:16:56] amen his ability as a seaman but you see
[1:17:00] what Peter failed to realize this just
[1:17:02] wasn't a
[1:17:03] storm this was a storm Jesus crossing
[1:17:08] the stormy sea the devil knew he was on
[1:17:10] the road to a great win to a great
[1:17:13] Victory and he tried to drown them that
[1:17:15] night to cause a storm to come up and
[1:17:18] 10,000 Devils of the sea s that drowned
[1:17:22] him amen that night so this just wasn't
[1:17:25] a storm this was a 10,000 demon
[1:17:30] storm and he was tired and he was laying
[1:17:33] in the stern of the boat even the waves
[1:17:37] didn't wake him up and as the storm be
[1:17:39] to rise up and the cells were torn and
[1:17:42] the ores was
[1:17:43] broke and they begin to toss around the
[1:17:46] like a like a like a a bottle stopper on
[1:17:49] a choppy water maybe 20 foot waves amen
[1:17:55] mhm the boat rocking way up this way way
[1:17:58] back up this way way back up this way
[1:18:01] and every time it would go up water
[1:18:02] would come into the boat the shells were
[1:18:04] torn the ores were
[1:18:08] broke
[1:18:09] where was Jesus amen where was he it
[1:18:15] looked like if he really cared he'd have
[1:18:17] been up there with
[1:18:19] them if he really cared he would have
[1:18:21] told them the storm was coming right he
[1:18:24] knew it was coming he knew when it would
[1:18:27] hit he knew where it would hit he knew
[1:18:29] how great it would be
[1:18:31] am yes knowing the infant the beginning
[1:18:34] he knew what was going to
[1:18:37] happen he knew it was going to happen he
[1:18:40] knew when it was going to happen yes
[1:18:44] where was
[1:18:45] he where is he when we need you we need
[1:18:50] you the
[1:18:52] most he was up here when it was Cal when
[1:18:54] we got into the boat he was right
[1:18:57] here right where is he
[1:19:02] now he knew when it was going to happen
[1:19:05] he knew it was going to happen oh you're
[1:19:06] getting quiet that's
[1:19:10] good but listen the prophet said it only
[1:19:13] happened to test their faith that's
[1:19:17] right didn't he say so later so a real
[1:19:19] child of God in testing time they do not
[1:19:22] walk by sight they're physic eyes are
[1:19:25] closed to the things that are around
[1:19:27] them they only walk by faith you see you
[1:19:30] can't walk by sight and walk by faith at
[1:19:32] the same time the eyes of your head will
[1:19:35] lie to you they will deceive you but we
[1:19:37] must look not with the eyes of our head
[1:19:39] but with the eyes of our
[1:19:43] heart we look to the Unseen for there
[1:19:45] the Unseen things that are
[1:19:47] real they only walk by faith of the Lord
[1:19:50] Jesus looking to his word believing that
[1:19:52] he'll keep every word exactly the way he
[1:19:55] said he would do it testing times trials
[1:19:58] sometimes God let afflictions hit his
[1:20:01] people to test them for their faith he
[1:20:04] was oh don't miss this he was testing a
[1:20:08] saint not rebuking a sinner sometimes
[1:20:11] brother Bill things happen to us not
[1:20:13] because we fail god
[1:20:15] brother the Bible matter of fact the
[1:20:17] prophet said in Victory Day the more
[1:20:19] loyal the more testing
[1:20:22] amen so sometimes Christan when they
[1:20:25] have trials it's not because they fail
[1:20:27] God but it's because God's Got
[1:20:30] Confidence and you see the thing about
[1:20:32] test it's like going to the
[1:20:34] gym you you go to get into
[1:20:37] shape well I heard about it I don't know
[1:20:40] but and you start out with 5 PBS then
[1:20:44] you go to 10 15 20 then you go to 30 35
[1:20:48] you pull a
[1:20:50] muscle you go back to
[1:20:53] five but what are you do doing every
[1:20:55] weight gets stronger it makes the
[1:20:56] muscles get harder makes them get and
[1:20:58] that's the way Trials Come God allows
[1:21:00] tests and you pass that one then a
[1:21:02] little bit more and a little bit more
[1:21:03] but each test stronger greater what's it
[1:21:06] doing it's building faith
[1:21:10] muscles if God delivered me out of this
[1:21:12] storm he can deliver me out of that
[1:21:13] storm
[1:21:15] [Applause]
[1:21:16] amen hallelujah amen so if you're in a
[1:21:19] trial not don't well God must hate me no
[1:21:22] no no matter of fact you'll find it's
[1:21:24] just the oppos it amen it's because he
[1:21:27] loves
[1:21:32] you amen maybe that's why you're sick
[1:21:36] tonight amen maybe that's why there's a
[1:21:38] law in Revival is to see what you're
[1:21:41] going to do about it are you going to
[1:21:43] pick it up what are you going to do so
[1:21:45] we find sometimes God listen to me when
[1:21:49] the when the church is on fire
[1:21:50] everybody's hollering amen and
[1:21:51] Hallelujah it's easy to say Amen man
[1:21:55] it's easy to raise your hand it's easy
[1:21:57] to stand when everybody else
[1:22:01] stands but let a law the Revival come
[1:22:03] when nobody says
[1:22:05] amen come on now are you still going to
[1:22:09] say Amen is the word still true whether
[1:22:11] anybody acknowledges it don't change the
[1:22:14] word and sometimes God allow just to see
[1:22:17] what are we going to do about
[1:22:19] it you see the testing of faith is not
[1:22:21] on top of the mountain when everything's
[1:22:23] going good it's really when we're in in
[1:22:24] the valley when everything's going wrong
[1:22:26] can we still praise him can we still
[1:22:28] worship can we still have Revival
[1:22:30] meetings
[1:22:32] amen I preached the message here a few
[1:22:34] years ago this day I give my all for
[1:22:36] Jesus Christ and I got it off of a when
[1:22:38] I was down at UT football stadium and
[1:22:41] they had a sign in the in the locker
[1:22:42] room and the and the guys would slap
[1:22:44] that sign when they went out onto the
[1:22:46] field and I was looking around in this
[1:22:47] locker room and I had an invitation to
[1:22:50] tour the UT Stadium I said yeah I'd like
[1:22:52] to see it so I go down there so I go
[1:22:54] into the locker room and when I walk in
[1:22:56] there brother Paige the carpet this is
[1:22:57] nice carpet but that carpet was about
[1:23:00] that thick it was
[1:23:01] like I thought my Lord I got that kind
[1:23:05] of carpet and these guys wearing
[1:23:08] cleats and I looked and they had lockers
[1:23:11] and above each Locker was the name of a
[1:23:13] football player who had played there who
[1:23:14] had done great things for the state of
[1:23:16] Tennessee for the for the utth
[1:23:18] volunteers and you know I don't know a
[1:23:20] lot about football but there was a few
[1:23:21] names I recognized one of them was pton
[1:23:23] Manning so this locker and above this
[1:23:25] Locker was P Manny it mean p Manny when
[1:23:27] he played for UT he had that Locker so
[1:23:30] when you get that Locker you can look up
[1:23:31] and say if P Manny did great things for
[1:23:33] Tennessee and had this Locker if I've
[1:23:35] got this Locker I can do great things
[1:23:37] for Tennessee too and they had another
[1:23:39] Reggie White and a few that's the only
[1:23:41] two I really recognize but I was looking
[1:23:43] at that and I thought you know God's got
[1:23:44] a locker room amen and above this Locker
[1:23:48] is a David and a
[1:23:50] Daniel you say if God did great things
[1:23:52] for Daniel and God did great things for
[1:23:55] David then he can do great things for
[1:23:58] Meen you see sometimes I think the devil
[1:24:01] wants to put these guys like a David and
[1:24:03] a Daniel and a Moses put them up so high
[1:24:07] right well you can well you can never be
[1:24:09] that but you see if you'll only realize
[1:24:11] David was just a man like you are who
[1:24:14] believed God for the day he lived in
[1:24:17] that's right amen amen amen you know you
[1:24:21] mentioned gono one of my favorite
[1:24:23] characters in history is gono a good
[1:24:26] just a you know the prophet said so many
[1:24:28] good things about gono mhm he did but
[1:24:31] when you mention the name jono people
[1:24:33] get an image in their mind of an Indian
[1:24:35] with feathers on a horse and flute
[1:24:39] music you know you mentioned gono you
[1:24:41] think of an Indian on a horse and
[1:24:43] Feathers but how many knows gerano drove
[1:24:46] a
[1:24:48] car I guess not you nobody amen how many
[1:24:53] know he wrote a ferris wheel do you know
[1:24:55] that you know Dono was on the 1910
[1:24:58] inaugurational parade of Teddy Roosevelt
[1:25:01] he wrode in that
[1:25:02] parade you say what are you saying I'm
[1:25:04] simply saying this we get this image in
[1:25:06] our mind and a lot of times Hollywood
[1:25:08] produces that image and we get that
[1:25:10] image in our mind but in reality it
[1:25:12] wasn't that way at all brother B said he
[1:25:14] was just fighting he was just a man
[1:25:16] fighting for his god-given rights that
[1:25:18] God gave him a land and a nation and a
[1:25:20] place to live amen so I'm trying to tell
[1:25:23] you friends that that we are just like
[1:25:25] David just like we're just people for
[1:25:27] our day that God has placed Us in this
[1:25:29] hour that we would take the word for
[1:25:30] this hour and make that word live amen
[1:25:34] amen amen amen and so they would slap
[1:25:38] that sign and they would go out into the
[1:25:40] 96,000 screaming fans this day I'll give
[1:25:44] my all for Tennessee and they was
[1:25:46] willing to go out there and get bruised
[1:25:47] and break bones and and get dirty and
[1:25:50] sometimes even get paralyzed even people
[1:25:51] have died on a football field but they
[1:25:53] was willing to do that for Tennessee and
[1:25:55] I looked at that and I thought my God
[1:25:57] and brother Martin's got one above his
[1:25:58] church I thought that ought to be above
[1:25:59] every Church door of every message
[1:26:01] church this day I'll give my all not for
[1:26:04] Tennessee not for Michigan come on some
[1:26:06] not for the Red Wings but for Jesus
[1:26:09] Christ that when I go out that door I
[1:26:11] can say I gave everything I had I gave
[1:26:14] my best amen I gave my best Hallelujah I
[1:26:17] sung the best I knew how to sing that
[1:26:19] this I heard one time that a man was
[1:26:21] deaf and dumb he couldn't see couldn't
[1:26:23] hear couldn't that and he used Braille
[1:26:26] and so they asked him said why do you
[1:26:28] even come to church you can't see you
[1:26:31] can't hear and he answered back and
[1:26:33] Braille I come so the devil will know
[1:26:36] what side I'm
[1:26:37] on oh Hallelujah when you come through

[1:27:05] with them they should have known he knew
[1:27:07] all these things they should have known
[1:27:09] that he knew what's going to happen they
[1:27:10] should have remembered he had it all in
[1:27:14] control why was he letting it
[1:27:16] happen when he got into the ship he knew
[1:27:19] it was going to happen why was he doing
[1:27:21] that testing their faith do you believe

[1:29:26] minutes I think I've told this sh before
[1:29:28] but it just comes to my
[1:29:30] mind there is a legend among the
[1:29:33] Cherokee it's called the ride of Passage
[1:29:36] that when a boy reaches the age of 12
[1:29:39] his father takes him to a secret place
[1:29:41] known only by the father and he sets him
[1:29:44] on a rock or on a tree stump and he ties
[1:29:47] his feet but he ties them loose so he
[1:29:49] can get out he ties his hands but he
[1:29:51] ties them loose so he can get out and he
[1:29:53] blindfolds the boy boy now the boy must
[1:29:56] sit there all night long if he cries out
[1:30:00] he fails the
[1:30:01] test if he slips out of the ties and
[1:30:04] lifts the blindfold to see what's going
[1:30:06] on he fails the test if he gets up and
[1:30:08] walks around he fails the test he must
[1:30:12] sit there all night long but at the
[1:30:16] rising of the sun when the first rays of
[1:30:18] the new day domes and Strikes the boy's
[1:30:21] face he can come out of the ties take
[1:30:23] off the blindfold and he's a man it's
[1:30:25] called the right of
[1:30:27] passage so the father takes him to the
[1:30:29] secret place sets him down ties him up
[1:30:32] and the boy must sit there am first few
[1:30:35] hours no problem about 9 or 10:00 when
[1:30:39] the coldness of the night begins to set
[1:30:41] in and the cies begin to Yelp gets a
[1:30:44] little
[1:30:45] nervous I used to go camping with the
[1:30:47] girls out in the backyard and I tell my

[1:31:19] blindfolded setting in the dark but at
[1:31:22] the rising of the Sun when the ray
[1:31:24] strikes the boy's face he comes out of
[1:31:26] the ties he lifts off the blindfold and
[1:31:28] it's only then that he realizes setting
[1:31:31] behind him is his
[1:31:36] daddy he had been there the whole
[1:31:40] time he had never left him
[1:31:45] alone and I'm so glad in this darkness

[1:37:19] before we close I heard a story I
[1:37:21] thought it was so good
[1:37:24] that this book store was having a book
[1:37:26] review and they invited this professor
[1:37:29] of a great University to come down and
[1:37:32] give his his his excerpt of this
[1:37:35] book so all the people come in to hear
[1:37:38] this book report and this this professor
[1:37:40] because he was kind of a famous guy so
[1:37:43] all these people come into the bookstore
[1:37:45] and he gets up you know and he greets
[1:37:46] the crowd and he saids now today I'm
[1:37:48] going to give I've read this book and
[1:37:50] I'm going to give you the interpretation
[1:37:52] of what the author was saying when he
[1:37:53] wrote this book he said so in chapter
[1:37:56] one what the author was saying was thus
[1:37:59] and thus and thus and the people
[1:38:01] just that's good so he goes to chapter
[1:38:04] two he said now in chapter two what the
[1:38:06] author was trying to relay was this and
[1:38:09] he told him and just as the people
[1:38:11] started to clap there's a man in the
[1:38:13] crowd said nope that ain't right right
[1:38:17] sort of like when somebody says Amen in
[1:38:18] The Message Church like
[1:38:24] so they go to chapter three and he says
[1:38:27] now in chapter three what the author was
[1:38:29] trying to say was this and the man said
[1:38:31] nope ain't right chapter 4 five 6 7
[1:38:36] every time the man in the crowd would
[1:38:38] speak up by the time it got to chapter
[1:38:40] eight this professor was fit to be tied
[1:38:42] and he just lost it and he started to
[1:38:45] say and before he could even say in
[1:38:47] chapter eight the guy said
[1:38:52] NOP and he he law he said who do you
[1:38:55] think you are don't you know who I am
