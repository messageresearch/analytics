[33:15] message uh brother my precious brother
[33:18] Mark has some uh important things to say
[33:22] and be we just he's intricate part of

[33:34] to to to share what he needs to share
[33:50] amen

[33:55] florid
[34:13] made I am all

[35:21] ways um him stand up and saying well I'm
[35:25] here I'm the man I because of and he you
[35:28] know fill in the
[35:30] blank that could not be true unless he
[35:33] decided to be
[35:35] faithful and he's the man he is because
[35:39] he decided to believe the
[35:42] word and faithfulness is like number one
[35:45] with
[35:46] God I mean any anybody can run a a a
[35:51] Sprint and say wow wasn't that good
[35:53] didn't I just do that great for the Lord
[35:56] but get up day after day after day and
[35:58] keep following those bloody
[36:01] Footprints and so we appreciate brother
[36:04] Mark we appreciate God using him for the
[36:08] furtherance of the
[36:10] kingdom yes we're sad he's
[36:13] leaving but you know what this is
[36:15] different this is different because he's
[36:19] not going back out in the
[36:21] world he's going to go win souls we
[36:24] don't know what the Lord has for us us
[36:27] but we just have to be obedient to him
[36:31] and we support
[36:33] him and uh it wouldn't matter if he fell
[36:37] flat on his face he he
[36:40] knows we support him and that God is
[36:44] going to lead him no matter how many
[36:45] times he falls if a righteous man falls
[36:47] seven times seven times he'll get back
[36:49] up we're grateful for brother Mark and
[36:52] the The Man He's become the ministry
[36:55] that he has for the Souls that he's
[36:57] going to bless and yes it's going to be
[36:59] hard on us but we should rejoice in the
[37:02] fact that God is using him and sending
[37:05] him out because that's the way it should
[37:07] be it's really the way it should
[37:11] be um and we just will continue to pray
[37:15] for brother Mark and and as he's at
[37:18] about the father's business we need to
[37:21] be about the father's business here amen
[37:24] we're looking forward to him coming back
[37:26] and
[37:27] giving us good reports every now and
[37:29] then amen let's stand together for the
[37:32] reading of the

[39:23] Thanksgiving Lord we're just beholding
[39:26] the testimony of a a young man who you

[39:32] world and you've
[39:34] develops Lord him to this point in his
[39:37] life that he could be
[39:39] used Lord for your ministry for the
[39:43] kingdom of God and we're so grateful for
[39:47] the

[39:51] work in a man's life that you could

[39:59] rejoicing with those that
[40:01] Rejoice today Father and father as we
[40:05] break in as we read your word and we

[40:11] unfold it as brother Ron said with
[40:13] Revelation the most important thing Lord
[40:16] give us all
[40:18] something that might help us draw closer
[40:21] to you
[40:23] today and God will give you the praise
[40:25] for it we love you we thank you now in
[40:28] Jesus Christ's name
[40:31] amen amen Luke chapter 18 we're going to
[40:35] start with verse number 18 and we've
[40:37] read this and heard this many time about
[40:39] the uh rich young ruler and a certain
[40:42] ruler asked him saying good Master what
[40:45] shall I do to inherit eternal life and
[40:48] Jesus said unto him why callest thou me
[40:51] good none is good save one that is God
[40:56] th thou knowest the Commandments do not
[40:58] commit adulter do not kill do not steal
[41:00] do not bear false witness under thy
[41:02] father and thy mother and he said all
[41:06] these have I kept from my youth up now
[41:11] when Jesus heard these things now when
[41:13] Jesus heard his response he said unto
[41:17] him yet lackest thou one thing sell all
[41:22] that thou has and distribute unto the
[41:26] poor and thou shalt have Treasures in
[41:29] Heaven and come and follow me and when
[41:35] he heard this he was very sorrowful for
[41:37] he was very
[41:40] rich and when Jesus saw that he was very
[41:43] sorrowful he said how
[41:45] hardly shall they that have riches enter
[41:48] into the kingdom of God Amen God bless
[41:51] you may be seated may may God just come
[41:55] and make this service of blessing for us
[41:58] today I I appreciate the service last
[42:01] Sunday amen amen if you haven't heard it
[42:04] listen to it if you did hear it listen
[42:07] to it
[42:08] again that's what I got to say it was a
[42:11] true it was a great blessing and I'll
[42:13] tell you I guess sometimes it's worth
[42:15] waiting to hear because we wanted our
[42:17] brother to come a little sooner but uh
[42:19] you could see his ministry is developing
[42:22] as well that's great blessing we want to
[42:24] entitle this today follow
[42:27] but from a
[42:28] distance and for a subject I just want
[42:30] to throw this out as a question to every
[42:32] one of us just how close have we been
[42:35] following
[42:37] Christ sometimes we can take our our
[42:41] foot off the
[42:42] gas as it were take our ores out of the
[42:45] waters brother brandom explained brother
[42:49] bman was talking in the men's meeting
[42:51] about Chuck Jager and
[42:54] how uh he was getting ready to to break
[42:56] through that sound barrier and just
[42:58] before he was getting ready to break
[42:59] through the plane really started shaking
[43:02] and if you never experienced this before
[43:05] it could be a scary thing man if I push
[43:07] the gas it's the plane's going to just
[43:09] blow up I'm going to die but he had a
[43:12] confidence that he was going in the
[43:14] right direction doing the right thing so
[43:16] he kept his foot down is the pedal to
[43:19] the metal as it were kept the gas going
[43:22] the throttle you know what I'm trying to
[43:24] say and it broke through the sound and
[43:26] it was just perfectly calm at that time
[43:29] amen and you know there's things that
[43:31] happen in every one of our lives that
[43:34] cause
[43:35] us uh to get
[43:38] distracted uh uh to
[43:41] question and and and there are times
[43:45] that we might feel like taking a
[43:48] backseat as it
[43:50] were and
[43:52] um uh not quit
[43:56] but really not be all in that's right
[44:01] and and so it's a really good question
[44:03] where are we how close have we been
[44:07] following Christ we take a look at this
[44:09] this Rich Young Ruler and he had been
[44:12] following the word the Bible says in
[44:14] keeping the Commandments but when his
[44:17] life crossed paths with more of the word
[44:21] coming to another church service and
[44:24] hearing more of the
[44:28] word he
[44:30] declined to take the word it was too
[44:34] much of a
[44:35] sacrifice so what did he do he
[44:38] decided to not follow Christ that close
[44:46] right because he had at stake he had his
[44:50] will which is the same thing we got we
[44:52] may not have money like he
[44:54] had but we have our
[44:56] will and God is always you know
[44:59] challenging us to draw closer to him
[45:02] there is nothing more than what he wants
[45:05] is to be close to his wife amen right
[45:09] yeah now we're living in the greatest
[45:11] hour of
[45:12] deception right it's dark there's a
[45:15] falling away there's trials it's the
[45:17] greatest shaking that's coming upon the
[45:20] the Earth people are leaving
[45:22] Christianity it's a great apostasy right
[45:25] and many of the people that are actually
[45:26] staying in church have taken a step
[45:31] back taken a backseat and decided to
[45:34] follow Christ but from a distance are
[45:38] you with me yes sir is this is this a
[45:40] can anybody relate to what I'm saying
[45:43] here now it's hard to find people today
[45:46] who are sold out who are on fire for God
[45:49] who are living for others who are
[45:51] hungering and thirsting for more of God
[45:53] to to worship to dig deep they it's hard
[45:56] to find something they can't wait till
[45:58] the doors are open
[46:01] right people have just begin to relax
[46:06] believers who once believed in a half
[46:09] hour prayer before service are happy if
[46:12] they just make it to church
[46:15] right and there are literally some who
[46:18] look for reasons so they don't have to
[46:20] go to church come on now now I'm not
[46:23] pointing fingers at anybody I don't know
[46:26] uh
[46:27] anything but I know the spirits that try
[46:30] to get on us that's right that's the
[46:32] truth believers who once walked close to
[46:35] the Lord have been satisfied with just
[46:37] following from a
[46:39] distance that's a it's not a good
[46:42] situation to be in I want to take a look
[46:45] at Peter we all know the story of Peter
[46:48] but turn with me if you we would in the
[46:50] Book of Luke chapter
[46:54] 22
[46:56] now this is not a a sermon that's going
[46:58] to um make you feel all guy
[47:04] inside but this is we Brother s we do
[47:07] come to church find out where we're at
[47:08] with God and and look this is why we
[47:10] believe in a fivefold Ministry because
[47:12] we don't definitely don't want everybody
[47:14] like me right definitely don't want that
[47:19] yeah but God must have saw some purpose
[47:22] for
[47:23] me in the ministry there's got to be
[47:26] some
[47:27] purpose and and I just believe in trying
[47:30] to help us see things that maybe we
[47:32] don't always see to help us in our walk
[47:35] so let's start with verse
[47:37] 31 Luke
[47:39] 22:31 and the Lord said Simon Simon
[47:43] behold Satan have desired to have you
[47:47] that he may sift you like
[47:50] wheat we see Satan's motive for each one
[47:53] of us here today is to sift us like we
[47:56] he wants to possess
[47:58] us not to help us get what we want in
[48:01] life but to separate us and make us feel
[48:05] alone because that's what happens when
[48:07] you sift wheat right Charles Spurgeon
[48:10] said consider how precious a soul must
[48:12] be when both God and the devil are after
[48:15] it wow
[48:17] right Peter said be sober be vigilant
[48:20] because your adversary the Devils a Roy
[48:23] line walketh about seeking whom he may
[48:26] devour whom resist steadfast in the
[48:28] faith knowing that the same things that
[48:30] are happening to you are happening to
[48:33] your brother around the world
[48:35] true he wants to sift us like wheat so
[48:40] in order to remain sober and Vigilant
[48:43] and steadfast in a faith a Believer
[48:46] needs to be prayed up and to stay prayed
[48:49] up amen there's no other way am that's
[48:52] right amen look at verse 32
[48:56] Jesus said but I have prayed for thee
[48:59] that thy faith fail not and when thou
[49:02] art converted strengthen thy Brethren
[49:07] prayer was the
[49:09] answer to keep in the faith alive
[49:13] amen and I'm so glad that Jesus prayed
[49:16] for you and I amen amen thank you Lord
[49:20] amen Jesus knew what was going to happen
[49:23] to Peter before it ever happened and the
[49:25] answer answer was prayer for his
[49:27] personal faith to stay the
[49:29] course I believe in the prayers of Jesus
[49:33] Amen I'm thankful for everybody's prayer
[49:36] here amen but I'm really really holding
[49:39] on to the prayer that Jesus had
[49:42] amen and this prayer gets us through
[49:46] until we get
[49:48] converted that prayer that Jesus prayed
[49:51] in St John 17 was that we would be one
[49:55] that prayer was there until we become
[49:57] one amen now after we get converted we
[50:01] should no longer be living for ourselves
[50:04] right amen that's the truth amen it's
[50:07] quite easy nowadays to think that we've
[50:08] been
[50:10] converted it is it's easy you just all
[50:13] you got to do is think it and you are
[50:15] right but Jesus said search the
[50:18] scriptures they are the ones that
[50:19] testify what a true conversion really
[50:24] is when you converted you're actually
[50:27] living for
[50:30] others and it's not something you just
[50:33] do once in a while you do some random
[50:36] acts you have a different nature and you
[50:39] live for others without a respect to
[50:42] persons brother John God has used me in
[50:45] so many ways I have so many testimonies
[50:49] I understand I know we've heard
[50:52] them Peter had testimonies too he walked
[50:56] on the water he had Crusades with
[50:59] Jesus he walked he talked he
[51:03] traveled he saw miracles happen right
[51:07] and Jesus was his teacher right but he
[51:10] wasn't converted
[51:14] amen Jesus had given them power over
[51:18] against unclean spirits to cast them out
[51:20] and to heal all manner of sicknesses and
[51:22] all manner of diseases but the bottom
[51:24] line is Peter was not
[51:26] converted
[51:29] right so how far will you go before you
[51:33] just like lay back and say you know what
[51:35] I don't feel like
[51:40] trying Peter wasn't a new creature
[51:44] yet old things were still hanging on him
[51:47] he still had his pride his reputation
[51:50] right he still had all things figured
[51:52] out in his life how things were going to
[51:54] be
[51:56] granted some things had changed in his
[51:58] life but all things had not become
[52:01] new and the Bible says when a man is
[52:04] converted All Things become new
[52:09] right all things are of God who have
[52:13] reconciled us to himself by Jesus Christ
[52:17] and have given unto us the ministry of
[52:20] reconciliation so at this time Peter had
[52:24] not been
[52:26] converted and Jesus was telling them a
[52:28] four time when you do get conversion
[52:31] when the conversion actually happens I
[52:33] know you're following me I I know I've
[52:35] given you power but when the conversion
[52:37] happens and you receive the power of the
[52:39] Holy Ghost where it's actually doing the
[52:41] witnessing all the time 24/7 365 days of
[52:45] the year
[52:47] amen then you're going to strengthen the
[52:50] Brethren yes to it that God was in
[52:55] Christ reconciling the world to himself
[52:58] not imputing the trespasses on them and
[53:00] have committed unto us the word of
[53:03] reconciliation am now then we are
[53:07] ambassadors for Christ there it is we're
[53:09] living for
[53:10] others as though God did beseech You by
[53:13] us we pray you in Christ said be
[53:16] reconciled to God Amen so when you're
[53:20] converted over to God he leads you and
[53:22] puts you in a position to convert all
[53:26] others amen that's what happens when you
[53:29] get converted yes sir when you get
[53:31] filled with the Holy Ghost now you're on
[53:33] the same you have the same purpose God
[53:35] has to see others converted to see
[53:39] others
[53:41] strengthened come on
[53:47] am when Jesus told Peter when thou art
[53:50] converted strengthen thy Brethren he
[53:52] wasn't meaning Pat them on the back and
[53:54] say you can make
[53:56] it no sir that's not what he meant the
[54:00] word strengthen means to turn resolutely
[54:03] in a certain
[54:05] direction to fix to establish to set
[54:11] fast resolutely is a purposeful
[54:15] determined
[54:16] unwavering
[54:18] manner that's what type of Christian the
[54:21] Holy Ghost makes
[54:23] you and and that's when God is working
[54:27] in you it's not about trying to help
[54:31] somebody that day and make him feel a
[54:32] little bit good help them get through
[54:34] the day I'm sorry that is not what Jesus
[54:38] meant he meant get them to the Holy
[54:41] Ghost get them converted amen get them
[54:44] to get filled with the holy spirit
[54:46] because it's the only thing that's going
[54:48] to withstand the devil in this
[54:54] age we no longer live as ambassadors for
[54:57] our own wants our own desires our own
[55:00] needs right we are now ambassadors for
[55:03] The Souls of other people amen so we
[55:05] take this ministry that God has given us
[55:08] and we lead others to become one with
[55:11] Christ to
[55:13] become an ambassador did didn't Paul
[55:16] tell Timothy that you need to be able to
[55:19] teach men that will be able to teach
[55:20] others also amen yes sir if you keep it
[55:23] going MH it's it's too easy to take a
[55:26] back seat and say well I'm in that's you
[55:28] know I'm
[55:30] set well okay you're set so you think
[55:35] but I'll tell you what you get a dose of
[55:36] the Holy Ghost that'll get you off that
[55:38] back
[55:41] seat too many people are relying on God
[55:44] using them as the determination for
[55:46] their
[55:49] conversion did not GE did not Jesus say
[55:52] many will come to me in that day and say
[55:54] Lord Lord have we not prophesied in thy
[55:56] name and in thy name cast out devils in
[55:58] thy name did many wonderful works and
[56:00] then will I profess unto them I never
[56:03] knew you depart from me ye workers of
[56:06] iniquity and Brother Band told us that
[56:08] iniquity was not doing the right things
[56:11] that we should be doing yes right than
[56:14] not making time out of our busy schedule
[56:16] to reconcile others to Christ is
[56:19] Iniquity amen that's right and we think
[56:23] well that's an optional thing you know
[56:24] if you get time you just fit it
[56:27] in that's what I'm saying if if if
[56:31] you're converted we need to be living
[56:33] the word we need to be manifesting this
[56:40] amen if you've been converted just lend
[56:42] your body over to the
[56:46] Lord we must remember that we're not our
[56:49] own amen well we know how important it
[56:52] is to remember right right amen remember
[56:55] you're not your own you're bought with a
[56:57] price amen and that price is God's blood
[57:02] amen Paul told the Corinthian Church he
[57:05] says and that he died for all that they
[57:08] which live should not henceforth live
[57:10] unto them right but unto him which died
[57:14] for them and rose
[57:16] again and he told the Roman Church
[57:19] Romans he said the church in
[57:23] Rome therefore we are debtors not to the
[57:26] flesh to live after the
[57:29] flesh so we see here
[57:35] that we've got to analyze are we really
[57:40] walking real close to the
[57:42] Lord or are we walking from afar yeah
[57:47] we're following but how close are
[57:50] we brother random said in the message
[57:53] that day in Calvary
[57:56] talking about what happens after your
[57:57] conversion he said then what does it do
[58:01] it gives you after the that condition
[58:05] his Spirit to follow him and to do as he
[58:08] did for others who is following on he
[58:13] was just one man the perfect man he gave
[58:16] his life and he made an example for you
[58:20] now you must do it now the first thing I
[58:23] want to say is Jesus never lived for
[58:27] himself his life was spent for
[58:31] others that's perfectly eternal life he
[58:35] said amen when you say you go to church
[58:38] and you do good things that's
[58:41] fine but when you live to yourself you
[58:44] haven't eternal life now that's a strong
[58:48] statement I could never make that
[58:50] statement but I can read it amen I can
[58:54] read it and I can say Amen to it you
[58:57] know CU people want to live forsel and
[58:59] claim that they're close enough to God
[59:02] that they got eternal life because of
[59:04] they repented they got baptized they
[59:07] served God for a
[59:09] season they never want to come to grips
[59:12] that that Jesus Christ is the same
[59:14] yesterday today and forever amen and if
[59:17] you're struggling then you ought to be
[59:19] putting everything you got to get more
[59:21] of the Holy Ghost there just is not
[59:23] going to be any excuse
[59:25] on the day of
[59:26] judgment brother BR said eternal life is
[59:29] living for others it proved it when it
[59:32] come to the Lamb of God see he lived and
[59:35] he had eternal life because he did not
[59:38] live for himself he lived for others and
[59:41] you receive eternal life by receiving
[59:44] that day and you don't live for yourself
[59:47] no
[59:48] more you live for others now listen this
[59:53] this may be something while I just want
[59:54] to get through this and you know I just
[59:57] get on this is not real encouraging but
[59:59] we need to get serious about where we're
[1:00:04] at you know we ought to be booming with
[1:00:07] inviting people to church amen that's
[1:00:09] the truth we ought to be booming with
[1:00:11] sharing the true Holy Ghost with others
[1:00:15] amen someone said still on the same
[1:00:19] quote here but someone said how can you
[1:00:22] stand and let anybody call you such bad
[1:00:26] names and brother Brandon says you don't
[1:00:29] live for yourself you live for others
[1:00:32] that you might redeem that man you
[1:00:34] become sons and the trouble of it is the
[1:00:38] church has forgotten they were Sons
[1:00:42] right you're a son you're taking
[1:00:44] Christ's place you're a son so you don't
[1:00:47] live for yourself you live for others in
[1:00:48] other words if somebody does you harm
[1:00:50] somebody says something bad you get all
[1:00:52] bothered and huff puffed about about it
[1:00:55] because you forgotten you're a son and
[1:00:57] daughter of God because if you're a son
[1:00:59] and daughter of God you want that stuff
[1:01:01] to happen so you can show the love of
[1:01:03] God to that person amen sir how else is
[1:01:06] Christ going to be manifested that's
[1:01:07] right amen anybody can be good to those
[1:01:09] that are good to them right anybody can
[1:01:12] hang out with friends who like them
[1:01:14] right but try getting on a bad side and
[1:01:16] it's not even your fault you love them
[1:01:18] anyways that's Christ to me that's
[1:01:21] eternal life being manifested am Amen
[1:01:25] brother brand says well he says well
[1:01:27] brother brandom I can live for this
[1:01:29] brother because he sure is a nice
[1:01:33] man brother Bram said that's not it live
[1:01:37] for the man who hates
[1:01:39] you live for the person who would kill
[1:01:42] you if they
[1:01:44] could that's what they done to him they
[1:01:46] killed him and he died that he might
[1:01:49] save them that's eternal life when
[1:01:53] that's in your bosom your face in heaven
[1:01:57] then you sacrifice your own things and
[1:02:00] give them up like the sheep gives up its
[1:02:03] woe you look on towards calary isn't
[1:02:06] that a beautiful quote I'll tell you
[1:02:08] this is what teaches me what real how
[1:02:12] how close I am to God yes sir it's
[1:02:18] true because there's a lot of didn't
[1:02:21] there's a lot of people thinking that
[1:02:23] they're saved when they're not brother
[1:02:25] bam said even after the Rapture happens
[1:02:27] people will be coming up to the altar
[1:02:29] given their heart they
[1:02:32] think but it'll be too late thinking
[1:02:34] they got saved and they're not even
[1:02:37] saved so we can't go by how we feel
[1:02:40] about things we got to get dig into this
[1:02:42] message dig into the word what does the
[1:02:44] word say and then say is my life lining
[1:02:47] up with that right because that's all
[1:02:49] that matters and I'm so glad that God
[1:02:51] sent a message amen yes sir
[1:02:55] Amen in the message faith in the Son of
[1:02:58] God brother B says so each day I want to
[1:03:02] live not for myself if I live for myself
[1:03:06] I live a selfish life I want to live for
[1:03:10] others and give what strength I have not
[1:03:15] to myself and to my own
[1:03:19] pleasure but for the benefit of
[1:03:23] others that they'll build now notice
[1:03:26] this that they'll build the kingdom of
[1:03:31] God because I mean you can just give
[1:03:33] your life to marchad dimes and so many
[1:03:37] different things out
[1:03:38] there but it won't build the kingdom of
[1:03:41] God the the the whole purpose is to see
[1:03:46] others become what Christ wants them to
[1:03:49] become
[1:03:52] amen if we've been converted
[1:03:54] then we need to start reconciling others
[1:03:56] to Christ well brother John I just don't
[1:03:59] got time I don't got this I don't got
[1:04:01] that I I don't feel ready I I'm just not
[1:04:04] there I say don't ignore this Holy Ghost
[1:04:07] leadership amen
[1:04:13] don't we're going to see in the
[1:04:15] scriptures that Peter had a chance to
[1:04:17] reconcile some people and he decided not
[1:04:20] to he thought I'm just going to follow
[1:04:23] Christ I'm going to continue to follow
[1:04:25] Christ but it's going to be from a
[1:04:27] distance I tell you he lost his burden
[1:04:29] for Souls his trial consumed
[1:04:33] him he was so consumed with his own
[1:04:37] problems all
[1:04:39] right so Jesus told Peter I have prayed
[1:04:42] for thee that thy faith fail not when
[1:04:44] thou are converted strengthen thy
[1:04:45] brother verse 33 and Peter said unto the
[1:04:48] Lord unto him Jes Lord I am ready I am
[1:04:52] ready to go with you both into prison
[1:04:56] and you know if that ain't enough into
[1:05:02] death
[1:05:05] and as brother brettman said in the
[1:05:07] men's meeting Jesus knows all things and
[1:05:11] he said I tell thee Peter the shall
[1:05:13] not crawl this day before Thou shalt
[1:05:17] Thrice deny that thou knowest me my now
[1:05:23] that was what the word that was preached
[1:05:26] now can you imagine sitting in service
[1:05:28] and having something preached and you
[1:05:30] thinking no I don't believe
[1:05:32] it yeah you can relate to what Peter was
[1:05:35] saying that's why that the no wonder the
[1:05:38] angel like that song only
[1:05:41] believe I'd rather believe what the word
[1:05:44] is saying regardless of how I feel amen
[1:05:47] because the word is always right amen
[1:05:51] too often we get in arguments with the
[1:05:53] word our carnality says one thing and
[1:05:56] the word says another and I'm going to
[1:05:58] tell you what the word is my
[1:06:01] safety the word can't be wrong my
[1:06:04] feelings my emotions my ideas what I my
[1:06:08] my how I perceive things that all can
[1:06:11] get messed up and confused but the word
[1:06:13] is the anchor we have something
[1:06:16] steadfast and it's for our soul and if
[1:06:19] brother B he says eternal life is living
[1:06:21] for others why are we spending so much
[1:06:23] time Liv for
[1:06:25] ourself it's like we want to like tear
[1:06:27] that out of the message you can't that's
[1:06:29] your Vindication amen
[1:06:34] amen I love the word I love this messag
[1:06:38] amen verse 39 and he came out and went
[1:06:42] and he was and and he was want to the
[1:06:46] Mount of Olives and his disciples also
[1:06:48] followed him and when he was at that
[1:06:50] place he said unto them now notice this
[1:06:52] is the next thing that needs to happen
[1:06:54] pray that you enter not into
[1:06:58] temptation so this is what I want to say
[1:07:00] about Temptation temptation is coming no
[1:07:02] matter if you like it or not it's coming
[1:07:05] amen true prayer keeps you from just
[1:07:08] entering into the thing that's what
[1:07:11] prayer does prayer makes you sober makes
[1:07:13] you watch okay I see what's happening
[1:07:15] I'll stay on guard right just thinking
[1:07:18] oh I got this handled I no temptation's
[1:07:22] coming and it's going to take you
[1:07:25] unaware so you know Jesus is just
[1:07:28] telling him a four time telling them
[1:07:30] what he needs to do to prepare and he
[1:07:32] still isn't getting
[1:07:35] it when you look back at all the times
[1:07:37] you
[1:07:39] backsliding it's because you weren't
[1:07:41] really prayed up
[1:07:45] true verse 41 and he was withdrawn from
[1:07:49] them about a stone cast and kneeled down
[1:07:53] and prayed saying father if thou be
[1:07:55] willing remove this cup from me
[1:07:58] nevertheless not my will but thy will be
[1:08:00] done amen I think it's okay to ask God
[1:08:04] for something that you got a good idea
[1:08:06] that ain't his
[1:08:09] will just be real
[1:08:12] sincere and mean it not my will thy will
[1:08:16] be
[1:08:19] done you know God understands we're
[1:08:21] frail we're
[1:08:22] human but this is what prayer is all
[1:08:25] about look what happened after he prayed
[1:08:28] here in verse 43 and there appeared an
[1:08:31] angel unto him from Heaven doing what
[1:08:35] strengthening him amen strengthening him
[1:08:38] right in prayer and he's being honest
[1:08:41] with himself I've got this need I got
[1:08:43] this problem God it let me byass what I
[1:08:48] got to go
[1:08:50] through not my will thy will be done and
[1:08:53] he said the the right thing amen God
[1:08:56] will reward a Believer with strength if
[1:08:59] they're willing to stay there in prayer
[1:09:02] they that wait upon the Lord shall renew
[1:09:04] their strength am now just praying
[1:09:07] wasn't good
[1:09:09] enough Jesus had a job to
[1:09:12] do and praying to satisfy the
[1:09:15] requirements of prayer wasn't good
[1:09:18] enough in other
[1:09:22] words
[1:09:26] prayer gets you to the place that you
[1:09:28] can overcome it doesn't take the
[1:09:30] Temptation away right you're not going
[1:09:32] to get up and I pray today I'm going to
[1:09:34] have a great day that's not it you may
[1:09:38] have have that same bad day if you
[1:09:40] wouldn't have prayed but now you're
[1:09:42] going to be able to overcome amen
[1:09:45] amen how many times have you got up you
[1:09:48] started your day and you know that you
[1:09:50] didn't spend either time in prayer or
[1:09:52] enough time in prayer and you're going
[1:09:54] through the course of the day and it
[1:09:55] comes to your mind you know you should
[1:09:58] have prayed first you know you should
[1:10:01] have got serious stayed there longer in
[1:10:03] prayer it that's just the Holy Ghost
[1:10:06] amen because the trial is still
[1:10:09] coming but you're not spiritually strong
[1:10:12] to deal with it verse 44 and being in
[1:10:16] agony he prayed more earnestly and his
[1:10:19] sweat was as it were great drops of
[1:10:21] blood falling down to the ground
[1:10:25] God's will for our life is not a bull of
[1:10:27] cheeries or some comfortable
[1:10:29] entertainment God's will will cause
[1:10:32] Agony in our
[1:10:34] lives the closer you follow the lord the
[1:10:36] harder it will be on your
[1:10:39] flesh in the men's meeting we're talking
[1:10:42] about God knows our our afflictions and
[1:10:46] our sicknesses and how hard it is for us
[1:10:49] at times and he cares about us he wants
[1:10:51] us to cast our cares upon Him and I made
[1:10:54] this statement I said God wanted us to
[1:10:58] go through
[1:10:59] sickness to be in pain to hurt so he
[1:11:03] could show what a God of comfort he is
[1:11:07] because without us going through the
[1:11:09] trial he would never be out of there to
[1:11:11] save the
[1:11:13] day and so this is God's got everything
[1:11:16] under control we don't have to worry
[1:11:18] about what the world's going on we know
[1:11:21] he has everything under control
[1:11:24] verse 45 and when he arose up from
[1:11:26] prayer and was come to his disciples he
[1:11:29] found them
[1:11:31] sleeping for
[1:11:34] sorrow and he said unto them why sleep
[1:11:37] ye rise and pray lest you enter into
[1:11:40] temptation so here's the signal again I
[1:11:42] don't feel like praying I'm a little
[1:11:44] back I God knows what I'm going through
[1:11:46] and I don't feel like trying you know
[1:11:48] what that God is not
[1:11:51] acceptable right if you don't want to
[1:11:53] crucify by your flesh don't expect God
[1:11:56] to come in on the scene amen that's
[1:11:59] right men ought always to pray and not
[1:12:05] faint okay now Jesus is betrayed by one
[1:12:09] of his follow verse 47 while he yet
[1:12:11] spake Behold a multitude and he that was
[1:12:16] called Judas one of the 12 went before
[1:12:18] them and Drew near and and G unto Jesus
[1:12:21] to kiss him and Jes Jesus said unto him
[1:12:24] Judas betray us thou the son of man with
[1:12:26] a kiss you know the way that he said
[1:12:28] that you just know that Jesus had such
[1:12:32] love for
[1:12:33] Judas amen still loved him you know to
[1:12:38] me we would have went out the other door
[1:12:40] we would have started talking negative
[1:12:42] about them we would
[1:12:43] have I mean when bad things happening
[1:12:46] their doors are wide open for
[1:12:49] opportunities to show the love of God
[1:12:51] Amen yes sir amen why you never have to
[1:12:54] be afraid never if God is with you who
[1:12:57] could be against you am and I'll say it
[1:13:00] like this if the love of God is in your
[1:13:01] heart what can take you away from loving
[1:13:04] that person amen yes sir nothing because
[1:13:07] God's love is the strongest power on the
[1:13:09] earth now my love is so puny it can't
[1:13:12] even hardly get
[1:13:14] up but we don't even want to talk about
[1:13:17] our love we don't want to talk about how
[1:13:19] whose love is greater we just want God's
[1:13:22] love it's it's the
[1:13:26] greatest it'll pass the
[1:13:30] test and when they which were about him
[1:13:34] saw what would follow they said unto him
[1:13:37] Lord will we Smite with the
[1:13:41] sword and one of them this the uh smol
[1:13:44] the servant of the high priest and cut
[1:13:46] off his right ear and from what I
[1:13:49] understand that was
[1:13:50] Peter because he's proving that he's
[1:13:54] willing to be all in
[1:13:57] right but the only thing is he wasn't
[1:14:00] all in
[1:14:01] love right amen he was all in for
[1:14:04] fighting right but he wasn't all in for
[1:14:07] love we're set at the defense of the
[1:14:10] Gospel not the offense
[1:14:12] amen that's what you see the difference
[1:14:14] there and one of them smoke the Ser of
[1:14:16] the high priest cut off his right ear
[1:14:17] and Jesus answered and said suffer ye
[1:14:20] thus I want you to remember those four
[1:14:21] four words suffer ye thus far
[1:14:27] suffer and he picked up the
[1:14:30] ear or touched his ear and healed him in
[1:14:34] the middle of the chaos in the middle of
[1:14:37] fear in the middle of unknown the middle
[1:14:39] of betral the the middle of unfairness
[1:14:42] Jesus tells Peter
[1:14:45] suffer what are we want to do when we're
[1:14:47] in a trial this is so wrong this is not
[1:14:50] right we're going to yell our head off
[1:14:53] we're going to say
[1:14:55] everything we need to hear the voice of
[1:14:57] Jesus suffering amen you either believe
[1:15:00] Jesus is with you or you
[1:15:03] don't I'm telling you if he said I'll
[1:15:06] never leave you I'll never forsake you
[1:15:07] you got to believe
[1:15:10] it your feelings are going to tell you
[1:15:15] different then Jesus said unto the chief
[1:15:17] priests and the captains of the temple
[1:15:19] and the elders which were come to him be
[1:15:22] ye come out as against a thief with
[1:15:26] swords and St what what's going on what
[1:15:28] are you
[1:15:29] doing you don't take my life I give it
[1:15:33] amen when I was daily with you in the
[1:15:35] temple you stretch forth No Hands
[1:15:36] against me but this is your hour and the
[1:15:39] power of
[1:15:43] Darkness je Jesus clearly identifies
[1:15:46] what's happening but you know what he
[1:15:48] doesn't try to change the
[1:15:52] outcome he committed himself to the
[1:15:56] father he didn't go on there and try to
[1:15:59] manipulate people and things look I'll
[1:16:02] tell you this word gives me a road map
[1:16:05] of what I need to
[1:16:07] do it teaches me how to live this is not
[1:16:11] some story something we we watch on
[1:16:13] television this is a reality for the
[1:16:16] believer filled with the Holy
[1:16:18] Ghost verse 54 then took they him and
[1:16:22] led him him and brought him into the
[1:16:25] high priest's house and Peter followed a
[1:16:30] far off now this is the whole message
[1:16:31] right here this is what started it and
[1:16:34] Peter followed a far off so he's still
[1:16:38] following
[1:16:39] Christ but he's kind of taking a
[1:16:43] backseat not all in not all out just
[1:16:47] kind of from a
[1:16:48] distance at one
[1:16:50] point Peter's test testimony was that he
[1:16:54] was going to follow
[1:16:56] Jesus all the way and he would even be
[1:16:58] willing to die and something happened in
[1:17:00] his walk this trial came into Peter's
[1:17:03] life and he didn't understand it he
[1:17:04] didn't want to accept it but he he
[1:17:06] decided he make a clear-cut decision in
[1:17:09] himself that he was not going to walk as
[1:17:11] close to the Lord still going to come to
[1:17:15] church still going to believe but just
[1:17:17] not going to be as
[1:17:20] close I'll just sit in the back and I'll
[1:17:22] watch from a distance
[1:17:23] I'll just come into church but I'll slip
[1:17:26] in slip out real quick come on Hey
[1:17:29] listen you know I'm not being negative
[1:17:32] this is a positive thing right I think
[1:17:35] if we just say Amen we'll get the devil
[1:17:37] off our back amen that's
[1:17:42] right we can say that Peter Still
[1:17:44] followed the Lord but his life proved
[1:17:47] that it was from a distance the life
[1:17:50] proves is from a distance it's no no
[1:17:53] longer well you don't know what's in my
[1:17:55] heart brother I don't need to know
[1:17:57] what's in your heart all I got to do is
[1:17:58] listen to things you say watch the life
[1:18:00] that you live and I'll know what's going
[1:18:02] on that's right what they say if you
[1:18:06] want to know how somebody takes care of
[1:18:07] a car look to see
[1:18:09] how how the car looks on the
[1:18:15] inside you want to know how somebody is
[1:18:18] find out what they're listening to what
[1:18:20] they're
[1:18:21] doing what they're feeding
[1:18:28] on Peter had lost his trust for the word
[1:18:32] he lost his trust for the
[1:18:35] word something happened that made him
[1:18:38] doubt and it was the trial of suffering
[1:18:40] which makes us most of us withdraw and
[1:18:44] stop doing the word is something we have
[1:18:46] to suffer
[1:18:49] with too often Believers can become like
[1:18:52] Peter
[1:18:53] who have it all figured out in his mind
[1:18:55] because that's how Peter was he had it
[1:18:56] figured out in his mind this is what's
[1:18:58] going to happen let's get the story
[1:18:59] let's get nobody's going to take us
[1:19:01] because we're with Jesus the
[1:19:05] Messiah but
[1:19:08] no the way that Peter had it figured
[1:19:11] out wasn't the way that it was because
[1:19:14] God's thoughts are
[1:19:15] higher but to often we can think we got
[1:19:18] things figured out how things are going
[1:19:20] to go how it's supposed to work out this
[1:19:23] is what's going to happen and then when
[1:19:25] things don't go as planned they reside
[1:19:27] to just following Jesus from a
[1:19:30] distance following the ministry from a
[1:19:33] distance following the word of God from
[1:19:36] a distance taking a back seat no need to
[1:19:40] be on
[1:19:41] fire I'm not
[1:19:43] cold I'm not cold in God but I'm not hot
[1:19:47] either that place that God
[1:19:50] hates we don't even realize it
[1:19:53] it's not a matter if you're
[1:19:55] cold it's a matter if don't be
[1:19:58] lukewarm don't follow God from a
[1:20:03] distance get away from the spirit that
[1:20:06] just doesn't make you want to press in
[1:20:12] right how close are we
[1:20:15] following are we falling close enough to
[1:20:18] hear that still Small Voice when we need
[1:20:20] to have answers
[1:20:24] I don't think God wants us to go through
[1:20:26] life without knowing what we should be
[1:20:29] doing I don't think so God is not the
[1:20:32] author of
[1:20:35] confusion but sometimes we just don't
[1:20:37] want to pay the price I mean what
[1:20:38] happens when you don't got time to make
[1:20:40] a meal what happens you resort to
[1:20:45] microwave Ramen
[1:20:48] noodles maybe going through a drive-thru
[1:20:51] picking up some fast
[1:20:54] food so what happens when we don't got
[1:20:56] enough time to spend with God In
[1:20:58] Prayer we just resort to well this is
[1:21:01] what I
[1:21:04] think are we falling close enough to
[1:21:08] suffer for the will of
[1:21:11] God in other words when we're going
[1:21:12] through a problem we can murmur and
[1:21:14] complain manipulate yell get the sword
[1:21:16] out start cutting people with
[1:21:18] words or we can believe that God's still
[1:21:22] with this he's got this situation under
[1:21:24] control I'm just going to trust him that
[1:21:26] he's going to put on my heart what to do
[1:21:27] right
[1:21:28] now because it proves God on the inside
[1:21:33] amen are we following close enough to
[1:21:36] reconcile
[1:21:40] others think about
[1:21:43] it you got a burden for souls are you
[1:21:46] falling close enough to have a burden
[1:21:47] for
[1:21:50] Souls how about to Bear the approach of
[1:21:54] Christ these are good questions
[1:21:58] amen now look verse
[1:22:01] 55 and when they had kindled a fire in
[1:22:05] the midst of the hall and were sat down
[1:22:07] together Peter sat down among them he
[1:22:09] was just going to have some fellowship
[1:22:11] get
[1:22:12] warm but a certain maid beheld him as he
[1:22:15] sat by the fire and earnestly looked
[1:22:18] upon him and said this man was also with
[1:22:21] him
[1:22:24] and he denied
[1:22:25] him he denied
[1:22:28] him saying woman I know him
[1:22:34] not now notice still following but from
[1:22:39] a distance and after a little while
[1:22:41] another saw him and said Thou Art also
[1:22:44] of them and Peter said man I am not and
[1:22:47] about the space of one hour after
[1:22:50] another confidently affirms saying of a
[1:22:53] truth this fellow also was with him for
[1:22:55] he is a gilean and Peter said man I know
[1:22:59] not what thou sayest and immediately
[1:23:01] while he yet spake the crew and the
[1:23:04] Lord turned and looked upon Peter and
[1:23:07] Peter remembered the words of the Lord
[1:23:09] how he had said unto him be before the
[1:23:12] Crow Thou shalt deny me Thrice and
[1:23:15] Peter went out and wept
[1:23:20] bitterly he had
[1:23:24] regrets happening right in front of
[1:23:27] them the problem with our carnal flesh
[1:23:30] is that when the word says one thing
[1:23:33] we'll sit there and deny it
[1:23:37] yes instead of just saying Lord that's
[1:23:39] your word I need to line up to
[1:23:41] it there's a difference between humility
[1:23:44] and pride and look Saints I don't care
[1:23:48] how close you are to God and I don't
[1:23:49] care how far you're away from God what
[1:23:51] needs to happen is we we need to get
[1:23:52] closer amen amen because the devil has a
[1:23:56] tendency of just constantly making that
[1:23:58] Gap bigger and bigger and bigger and I
[1:24:00] tell you Church tendons don't do it
[1:24:02] that's right Church tendons does not do
[1:24:04] it what does it is when you start
[1:24:06] believing the word that you hear
[1:24:09] amen now the word warned Peter to stay
[1:24:12] prayed up for Spiritual
[1:24:15] strength pray that you enter not into
[1:24:18] temptation and right in the middle of
[1:24:21] the trial the word told told Peter to
[1:24:23] suffer but the Temptation was too great
[1:24:27] I don't want to suffer I'm not going to
[1:24:30] do this I'm not going to let this happen
[1:24:32] either I'm GNA
[1:24:33] fight or I'm
[1:24:35] leaving you ever see something like that
[1:24:38] they'll fight or they'll
[1:24:40] leave they don't know how to they don't
[1:24:42] know how to love enough to believe that
[1:24:45] God is going to work out the situation
[1:24:48] now this has nothing to do with brother
[1:24:49] Mark because brother Mark has absolutely
[1:24:52] no issues with this church what we
[1:24:55] believe his wonderful
[1:24:58] [Laughter]
[1:25:00] pastor but you know what I'm saying when
[1:25:02] there's a problem there is no problem
[1:25:04] here brother Mark is being
[1:25:09] called that's not a
[1:25:11] problem that's a victory
[1:25:14] amen he just wants to be obedient to
[1:25:16] that and I
[1:25:18] I I could have tried you know
[1:25:23] you know put him in a headlock and say
[1:25:25] buddy you ain't going
[1:25:26] anywhere but I would just be trying to
[1:25:29] do that to the holy ghost that ain't
[1:25:34] right no I believe God has everything
[1:25:38] under control amen now Peter just
[1:25:42] couldn't walk away because he knew that
[1:25:44] Jesus had the words of eternal life so
[1:25:46] he resided to just following Jesus from
[1:25:49] afar and I want to ask you the question
[1:25:51] today if you could would truly take time
[1:25:53] to answer how close are you how close
[1:25:56] are you walking to
[1:26:00] him he got away from his complete
[1:26:02] commitment his full
[1:26:04] commitment he he became reluctant how
[1:26:08] many times you walk into church
[1:26:10] reluctant come on
[1:26:14] right how many times you get down in
[1:26:16] prayer and you just you feel reluctant
[1:26:19] in your prayer right true you're to pray
[1:26:22] in
[1:26:23] faith so we got to really be honest
[1:26:26] about this question I believe God wants
[1:26:28] us to have a closer walk with him amen
[1:26:31] amen but we've got to be honest with
[1:26:33] oursel and say yes I I know that I'm not
[1:26:36] walking where I need to be
[1:26:42] walking all right Luke chapter 9 verse
[1:26:49] 21 Peter could have gone through the
[1:26:51] same task in the same trial and been
[1:26:54] like
[1:26:58] this a Man Standing On Solid
[1:27:01] Ground I shall not be moved amen I mean
[1:27:05] Jesus wasn't moved in fact in the middle
[1:27:07] of his great trial he decides to take
[1:27:10] time to have a healing service heal
[1:27:12] somebody and they're going to take him
[1:27:14] away right he was so focused on doing
[1:27:18] the will of the Lord here he wants the
[1:27:21] cup
[1:27:22] taken away from him and this is the the
[1:27:26] initiation as it were of of of of being
[1:27:30] betrayed with a kiss and 30 pieces of
[1:27:32] silver and they're going to take him he
[1:27:34] knows everything that's going on and he
[1:27:37] doesn't call any of it
[1:27:39] out he just he ask questions why why
[1:27:42] didn't you get me before I mean what are
[1:27:44] you doing here I
[1:27:45] haven't he takes time to help somebody
[1:27:48] in the middle of his trial how often do
[1:27:49] you see somebody try to help somebody in
[1:27:51] the middle middle of their trial they're
[1:27:53] so consumed with their trial they don't
[1:27:54] got time to help anybody well I'm
[1:27:57] telling you the Holy Ghost isn't like
[1:27:58] that amen I want to be so possessed of
[1:28:02] God that others is really number one
[1:28:05] am now I can't make that happen but the
[1:28:07] Holy Ghost can amen
[1:28:12] amen and if I believe it oh if I believe
[1:28:17] it we're we're not I'm going to read
[1:28:20] these scriptures real quick I'm not
[1:28:21] going about get everything cuz I want to
[1:28:22] get to the end all right Luke 9: 211 and
[1:28:26] he straightly charged them and commanded
[1:28:28] them to tell no man that thing saying
[1:28:31] the son of man must suffer many things
[1:28:34] and be rejected the elders and the chief
[1:28:35] priests and the scribes and be slained
[1:28:37] and be raised the third day so here he
[1:28:40] had the word it was given to him when he
[1:28:43] went to church the word was given to him
[1:28:45] he knew was going to
[1:28:50] happen one place he said you know this
[1:28:53] ain't going to be you're you're you're
[1:28:54] not going to suffer I'm not going to let
[1:28:56] it happen and he said
[1:28:58] look you're going to have to suffer too
[1:29:02] that's what he said amen and so what
[1:29:04] does he say here and he said unto them
[1:29:06] all if any man will come after me let
[1:29:09] him deny himself take up his cross and
[1:29:12] daily and follow me so are we following
[1:29:17] from a
[1:29:18] distance or are we denying oursel
[1:29:22] are we taking up his
[1:29:24] will his will which
[1:29:28] is his will is for us to live for others
[1:29:31] and in order to do that we have to
[1:29:33] suffer because we don't get our will
[1:29:35] right it's it's that simple the pain is
[1:29:40] there for whosoever will save his life
[1:29:43] you know what I'm just going to do what
[1:29:44] I want to do is going to lose it but
[1:29:47] whosoever will lose his life for my sake
[1:29:49] the same shall save it for what
[1:29:51] advantage is a man if he gain the whole
[1:29:52] world lose himself or be a
[1:29:56] Castaway we have to go on and get more
[1:29:58] of the Holy
[1:29:59] Ghost we have to stop following Jesus
[1:30:02] from a distance we have to it's time for
[1:30:04] us to draw nigh to God set our
[1:30:07] affections on things above it's the
[1:30:09] Bible says it's high time for us to wake
[1:30:11] out of our Slumber our
[1:30:13] sleep press in press
[1:30:16] in we need to the goal is to manifest
[1:30:20] Christ we got to manifest him I wouldn't
[1:30:22] stop seeking God until you're satisfied
[1:30:25] with how much you're manifesting Christ
[1:30:28] we get too satisfied with I'm
[1:30:31] saved I'm in the I'm in the message I'm
[1:30:33] going in the
[1:30:35] Rapture but the life is trying to get
[1:30:38] somebody else in it's living for others
[1:30:42] it's not doing good deeds it's living
[1:30:45] for other people's Souls
[1:30:48] yes Lord help
[1:30:50] us instead of protecting our matcho
[1:30:55] spirituality that's what we usually do
[1:30:58] we need to Humble ourselves and admit we
[1:31:00] need more of him we need more of the
[1:31:02] Holy Ghost we need to manifest more of
[1:31:05] God on the inside of our
[1:31:09] Lives instead of complaining about
[1:31:11] things let's just manifest his
[1:31:13] will he may want you to suffer in the
[1:31:16] middle of your trial so others can see
[1:31:18] Christ manifested why would you give
[1:31:20] that up John said for this purpose the
[1:31:23] Son of God was manifested that he might
[1:31:26] destroy the works of the devil I'll tell
[1:31:27] you what when you're in the heat of a
[1:31:29] battle a heat of a battle with
[1:31:33] somebody if you just manifest the word
[1:31:35] the word says a soft answer turns away
[1:31:38] wrath
[1:31:39] amen but you know if you just want to I
[1:31:42] gotta prove you know they're wrong and
[1:31:44] you're going to stir up The
[1:31:47] Strife so manifest the word not prove
[1:31:50] who's right wrong we don't want to prove
[1:31:52] who's right or
[1:31:54] wrong Christ he's the only thing that's
[1:31:57] right he's the only one that's good and
[1:32:01] when you know it just works to our favor
[1:32:03] when we yield oursel to
[1:32:05] him all right now you got to
[1:32:09] believe that you're part of him you're a
[1:32:12] seed of God
[1:32:14] Amen and another words every seed brings
[1:32:16] forth of its kind you've got to manifest
[1:32:20] what Christ did
[1:32:22] look after Peter went and got the Holy
[1:32:25] Ghost he never denied Christ
[1:32:28] anymore and he told him you you stay
[1:32:30] there until you be endued with power
[1:32:32] from on high and you'll be Witnesses for
[1:32:34] me you'll know how to witness right now
[1:32:36] you only know how to witness when you
[1:32:38] know this guy's a nice guy that person's
[1:32:40] nice I get along you know we kind of see
[1:32:42] eye to eye but you stay away from the
[1:32:45] person that hates you you won't you
[1:32:50] just how strong long is your love how
[1:32:53] how much Holy Ghost do you got what are
[1:32:55] you afraid of
[1:32:57] Amen Don't Be Afraid God hasn't given us
[1:32:59] a spirit of
[1:33:01] fear but Power love and a sound
[1:33:08] mind now Jesus said If you deny me I'll
[1:33:11] deny
[1:33:12] you if you're ashamed of me I'll be
[1:33:15] ashamed of you yes and Peter did deny
[1:33:18] Jesus but I'll say it like this Peter
[1:33:21] went on to get the Holy
[1:33:22] Ghost God
[1:33:25] knew that that's the only reason he got
[1:33:28] denied was because he didn't have the
[1:33:30] Holy Ghost but what he once he got the
[1:33:33] Holy
[1:33:35] Ghost he said I don't care what you do
[1:33:37] to me I'm not gonna obey man I'm gonna
[1:33:40] obey God and I don't care you know
[1:33:42] brother Brian says I don't care if I got
[1:33:44] to preach to empty
[1:33:46] pews eat soda crackers and drink blanch
[1:33:49] water I'd rather do that than compromise
[1:33:51] with the truth
[1:33:53] because that's what the Holy Ghost does
[1:33:55] to a man it makes him stay with the
[1:33:59] word oh I love the
[1:34:01] word all right now we got to hurry
[1:34:04] because time is short now I don't know
[1:34:06] how much time
[1:34:08] um I think you know brother Mark was up
[1:34:10] here for you know maybe 15 20 minutes I
[1:34:13] can't remember so I got a little extra
[1:34:16] time turn with me First Peter chapter
[1:34:20] 2
[1:34:22] I just got one encouraging scripture
[1:34:24] right after this and then we'll quit
[1:34:26] okay so it's not long are you getting
[1:34:29] something out of it all right 1 Peter
[1:34:33] chapter 2 ver 18 servants be subject to
[1:34:36] your own masters with all fear not not
[1:34:38] only to the good and the gentle but also
[1:34:41] to the
[1:34:42] forward for this is thankworthy if a man
[1:34:45] for conscious towards God endure grief
[1:34:48] suffering wrongfully now that's what
[1:34:50] Jesus asked Peter to do
[1:34:55] suffer he had a hard time with it but
[1:34:59] Jesus did
[1:35:00] it and I'll tell you unless you get the
[1:35:02] Holy Ghost you just can't do it all the
[1:35:05] time for what glory is it if when you be
[1:35:09] buffeted for your
[1:35:11] faults you shall take it
[1:35:14] patiently but if when you do well you do
[1:35:17] the right thing you didn't do anything
[1:35:19] wrong and you suffer for it you take
[1:35:24] patiently this is acceptable with God
[1:35:29] you know we don't we just kind of like
[1:35:30] want to rip that out we don't want to
[1:35:32] think about it you we don't to hold
[1:35:33] ourselves accountable to that we just
[1:35:35] kind of want to like live our
[1:35:37] life and you know what I'll say
[1:35:42] this do you know how it must make God
[1:35:45] feel if you only want to take part of
[1:35:48] this word for your life the part that
[1:35:51] you you want the part that encourages
[1:35:53] you the the part that makes you happy
[1:35:55] the part that makes you prosperous but
[1:35:58] the part but the other part you don't
[1:36:01] want to do do you know how that makes
[1:36:04] him
[1:36:06] feel that you only love a part of
[1:36:13] God God wants us to become like him
[1:36:16] every seed's going to bring forth of his
[1:36:18] kind we've got to fall in love with the
[1:36:20] word that we don't
[1:36:24] like all right now look at this verse
[1:36:26] verse 21 for even here
[1:36:29] unto were you
[1:36:32] called amen you were called because
[1:36:36] Christ also suffered for us leaving us
[1:36:38] an example that we should follow his
[1:36:44] steps yes it's
[1:36:47] true Peter out of all people is telling
[1:36:50] us this
[1:36:52] the one who didn't follow his steps but
[1:36:55] after he got the Holy Ghost he had no
[1:36:58] problem taking those steps there's the
[1:37:00] difference the Holy Ghost is the
[1:37:02] difference it isn't your strength your
[1:37:04] ability how much God uses you how much
[1:37:06] you know about the Bible the Mysteries
[1:37:08] none of that matters what matters is are
[1:37:10] you humble enough to seek the Holy
[1:37:13] Ghost because we got to get sealed with
[1:37:15] it
[1:37:17] right now notice it said who did no sin
[1:37:21] neither was guile found in his mouth
[1:37:22] that this is this is the example that he
[1:37:24] left that we got to do we got to follow
[1:37:26] we got to have no gu in our
[1:37:29] mouth who when he was reviled reviled
[1:37:32] not again and when he suffered he didn't
[1:37:36] threaten
[1:37:37] back but he committed himself to him
[1:37:41] that judgeth
[1:37:44] righteously
[1:37:46] who his own self bear our sins
[1:37:51] in his own body on the tree now I just
[1:37:53] want to stop there we've been called to
[1:37:55] be ambassadors we've got to
[1:38:01] Bear the weak the the strong bear the
[1:38:04] infirmities the weak we have to bear we
[1:38:07] have to get our hands dirty we have to
[1:38:09] be willing to take on problems in
[1:38:11] people's lives because we're called to
[1:38:14] be
[1:38:15] ambassadors to really Point them to a
[1:38:18] life not just say well uh here's the
[1:38:22] cross but to have what it takes to get
[1:38:26] them to the Holy Ghost
[1:38:28] amen that's what a holy ghost filled
[1:38:30] believer does all right Psalms 91 then
[1:38:33] we're going to quit with this Psalms
[1:38:35] 91 so this is Sister Show's favorite
[1:38:38] Psalms we're going to read this right
[1:38:39] now and let because it's her favorite
[1:38:42] song that's not why we're reading it but
[1:38:45] I want you to think about this God is
[1:38:47] calling us to a closer walk what could
[1:38:50] be any closer than dwelling with
[1:38:53] him dwell with him dwell with
[1:38:57] him not from a
[1:39:00] distance but with him Psalms 91 he that
[1:39:04] dwelleth in the secret place of the most
[1:39:08] high shall abide under the shadow of the
[1:39:13] almighty
[1:39:15] amen now this doesn't happen by mistake
[1:39:18] this just doesn't happen because my name
[1:39:20] is John Martin and I go to send the
[1:39:22] light I'm sorry if that's all I had to
[1:39:25] do woo that'd be easy right but it takes
[1:39:30] denying your
[1:39:31] flesh picking up your cross and
[1:39:35] following
[1:39:37] him it's what it
[1:39:39] takes you just can't do what you want to
[1:39:42] do get in prayer and hope to be in that
[1:39:45] place God May bless you for a season but
[1:39:48] if you want to dwell there it's going to
[1:39:50] take a sacrif you have to live not unto
[1:39:53] yourself anymore but to live unto God
[1:39:56] Amen I will say of the Lord he is my
[1:40:00] refuge and my Fortress my God in him
[1:40:04] will I trust amen let's Stand Together
[1:40:08] may God grant us
[1:40:11] that that place so close to his heart
[1:40:16] that we hear him say how much he loves
[1:40:19] our enemy and we try to help
[1:40:23] them I believe if Jesus would stand here
[1:40:27] today that would be the character of him
[1:40:30] and he's the same he's not going to
[1:40:32] change we're the ones that need to
[1:40:35] change we're the ones that need to come
[1:40:37] into that full
[1:40:40] conversion until we're like and don't
[1:40:42] stop don't take the foot off the the
[1:40:44] pedal until you you are in his imageen
[1:40:48] don't be satisfied with just making the
[1:40:50] church
[1:40:53] church amen let's sing must Jesus bear
[1:40:55] the cross
[1:41:01] alone must
[1:41:04] Jesus bear the cross
[1:41:09] alone and all the world go
[1:41:15] [Music]
[1:41:17] free no there's a CR

[1:43:41] calling the
[1:43:42] cross the trials that come into our
[1:43:46] life is they not the same the people in
[1:43:49] the world that don't even serve God they

[1:43:56] enough they'll tell you about them but
[1:43:58] it's not the

[1:44:04] against your flesh just like it went

[1:44:43] given us such an easy word to believe
[1:44:48] you didn't make it hard you just said

[1:45:05] you they're taking that that step
[1:45:08] forward Lord and Desiring to be closer
[1:45:13] to you than they ever have and knowing
[1:45:15] when the Rapture takes place Lord we
[1:45:18] remember your Prophet saying God would
[1:45:20] not take anyone until they're as close
[1:45:23] as they could be and your bride is still
[1:45:26] here and Lord there's still a closer
[1:45:29] walk for them and when that Rapture
[1:45:31] takes place they're going to be as close
[1:45:33] as they could possibly be to you because
[1:45:36] you said your Prophet said not take us
[1:45:40] until we're as close as we can be so
[1:45:41] Lord you have us here for a
[1:45:43] reason and father we want to submit our
[1:45:47] life unto you Lord we want to commit our
[1:45:51] life to you that no matter what things
[1:45:54] happen we want to believe that you're
[1:45:56] with us in the middle of our trials we
[1:45:59] don't want to be
[1:46:00] testifying that things are are chaotic
[1:46:04] and and and out out of sync we want to
[1:46:08] be testifying that you're in control
[1:46:10] because you living inside of us Lord
[1:46:13] father I pray that you take our lives
[1:46:15] and begin to manifest more eternal
[1:46:18] life help us to give us a deeper
[1:46:21] revelation of living for others what it
[1:46:25] entitles and how it fits into our
[1:46:28] life and Lord may we always be abounding
[1:46:32] in the work of the Lord knowing that our
[1:46:34] labor is not in vain bless each hand
[1:46:38] Bess bless each heart bless each mind
[1:46:40] may they leave here with a confidence
[1:46:44] Lord that you are going to draw nigh to
[1:46:47] them because they have they are drawing
