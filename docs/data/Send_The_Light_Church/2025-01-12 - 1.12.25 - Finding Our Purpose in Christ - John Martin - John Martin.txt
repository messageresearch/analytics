Jesus Christ's name we pray amen amen turn with me if you would to the Book of Ecclesiastes chapter 3 I certainly like that song stand up for Jesus that we sung this morning believe it fits right into the message today we have to take a stand everybody's standing for something you may not think you're standing for something but if you're not standing for something you're standing for yourself that's that and that Shaky Ground down there um this morning we want to talk about finding our purpose in Christ finding our purpose in Christ starting here in Ecclesiastes chapter 3 let's read the first 11 verses to everything there's a season and a time to every purpose under the heaven a time to be born and a time to die a time to plant and a time to pluck up that which is planted A Time to Kill and a time to heal a time to break down and a time to build up a time to weep A Time To Laugh time to mourn and a time to dance a time to Cast Away Stones time to gather Stones together a time to embrace and a time to refrain from embracing a time to get and a time to lose a time to keep and a time to Cast Away a time to Rend a time to sow a time to keep silence and a time to speak a time to love a time to hate time of war and a time of Peace what profit have he that worketh in the in that wherein he labor Earth I have seen the travail which God have given to the sons of men to exercise in it he have made everything beautiful in his time also he have set the world in their heart so that no man can find out the work that God maketh from the beginning to the end God bless you may be seated these scriptures have been um some scriptures that I've known for many many years I would think almost before um or near the time that I gave my heart to the Lord not sure but it goes back that far in fact there was a song I used to listen to uh in the world and I can't remember the the group but probably brother Marty knows turn turn turn something like the yeah so that was a cool song you know but this is a blessed word and uh has a message have you ever heard anyone say you need to find a purpose in life it's a very common phrase I remember when I was trying to figure out what I was going to do in my life what direction I was supposed to take what I was supposed to pursue and some of you heard I I wanted to be a doctor didn't know if I was going to be a professional hockey player or musician uh one thing you don't know I don't think I've ever said I wanted to actually have a hardware store and I I wanted to write a book as you know I started going to college I wanted to be a medical uh assistant because I I knew I couldn't stay that in school that long to be a doctor because I just I didn't have a desire to uh be a doctor more than you know wanting a family that was my greatest desire but I wanted to be a finished Carpenter too at one point I wanted to be a Furniture maker I remember to this day putting an application into the road commission because I was going to be happy filling potholes so you talk about trying to figure out my purpose in life I had a whole gamut of ideas here of course my thoughts were not his thoughts at all God had a much greater purpose for me both naturally and spiritually not only did God have a purpose under the heaven for me but he had a season for it as well and I agree with the scripture here that God makes everything beautiful in his time we want to talk about finding our purpose in Christ it's important because all those things that I made mention that I wanted to do I'm not doing any of them and I could take any one of those and just say you know God could use me in that area which he can he can use a donkey but the the the thing that I'm trying to say is it's better if you just let God tell you what to do I was at a point I even made mention this to Cheryl I said that I would never ever have a business and I certainly was not going to have a to business so just everything about me was contrary with God and if I never humbled myself to say God God show me have your way I want your will that is the biggest thing God I want your will because if the heart and the desire is not to to want God's will above everything else then we'll get lost trying to get our will and God's Will and it'll get mixed up but God had a purpose for my life and I didn't know it and God has a purpose for our lives both naturally and spiritually and some of us may not know what that really is some of us done we're seasoned we're seasoned we can see certain things that God has transpired in our life and and I'm not saying that God couldn't bless me doing anything because I just believe that he could right God God could but I'm just not interested in that I I I it's always better to be in in what God has purposed for our lives Paul had a self-will purpose before he was converted he really thought he was doing exactly what God wanted him to do he had scriptures to back it up he was he was he was the best among the best and and he was right in his own eyes and from a worldly standpoint he did his best to fulfill the word of God from a worldly standpoint unfortunately he was moving with a bulldozzer with what he thought to do he was working actually against God's purpose for his life he was fighting against God's purpose and didn't know it and sometimes when we could just look at our will we could be actually fighting against what God's will is for our life Jesus told so I am Jesus whom thou persecutest it is hard for the to kick against the Pricks in other words it's harsh and painful and fruitful and harmful for you to resist the purpose of God you're you're not going to change God you're not going to change his will you're not g to you can't do anything against the word the Bible says only for the word you can fight against God's purpose but God's purpose is always going to work always going to stand always going to move forward the only thing is we make miss out right we may miss out when Paul humbled himself to walk in God's purpose it's when he per is when he prospered spiritually and he says here in 2 Timothy 3:10 I'm just going to quote it I don't have it up on the board but thou has fully known my Doctrine my manner of life my purpose you've known my purpose my faith my longsuffering my charity my patience my persecutions and afflictions which came unto me in Antioch and Iconium and listra and pers what persecutions I endured but out of them all the Lord delivered me amen how many has suffered some sort of persecutions in the last week let me see your hands think about that persecuted in this time that we're living but the devil is still the devil just working through other people and other means so because we suffer persecutions because we are are called all sorts of things it doesn't mean God's not with us we have a promise that God will deliver us out of them all God made Paul's life beautiful in his time to Paul's life there is a season and a time to every purpose under the heaven now I'm so glad today that Paul decided to surrender his life to God and say who art thou Lord I really I really want to know you because at one time he thought he knew God he read the Bible he knew the Bible so good but he didn't know God but when God spoke to his heart had that encounter it was a real real encounter it wasn't just something uh that he saw with his eyes it was something that he saw with the eyes of his heart there was a connection that took place and he had to step back and say who art thou Lord I'm so glad because we wouldn't be reading 14 books of the New Testament unless he made that decision that is how important it is for us to find a God's purpose for our life to find where we fit into God's purpose because there's something down the road I'll be I'll be honest with you there was obviously a point in my life that I knew nothing nothing I didn't know God didn't know nothing didn't know what I should be doing nothing but somehow God had to bring that to manifestation and that only happens when you yield your life and you say God I want to know because if we just go on in our life and kind of do what we want to do we're going to miss what God has let's look at Andrew Peter James and John they left their father's profession to follow Jesus Matthew he left his government job as a tax collector and God had a greater purpose for David than what he thought or what his dad even thought Moses was taught what his purpose was from a a young child I believe but he leaned to his own understanding about the purpose that God had for him and when he did he failed he failed because he used his own ability in to to fulfill God's purpose instead of using God to fulfill his purpose there's a big difference when Jesus said don't go witnessing don't go testifying don't be telling the world about me until you're in due with power from on high he will be your ability amen so then it took 40 years for God to bring him to a place that God could fulfill his purpose in his life 40 years 40 years think about it God could have did it one year but why 40 because I I believe that God works through free more agency the more that we hunger and thirst and desire the more that God will fill us and the more we just say well I'm going to do what I want to do and if God wants me to do he just gonna have to make it happen I don't think God is like that I don't think God is is he's got robots he wants a love affair I believe his bride would desire the will of God for their lives God sovereignly allowed Joseph to be born in a dysfunctional family anybody ever been know anybody like that well Joseph was one of them he was rejected by his siblings and when he was 17 years old he was taken captive by his brothers and he was abandoned and sold as a slave into a foreign land that was Egypt you we know this and this is where he began the next 13 years of hardship falsely accused of rape sent to prison unjustly and it was forgotten by a friend now we know God was with Joseph but why did all this happen to him you can't go by what's happening in your life Genesis 50:1 15 if you like to follow along with us up on the board here Genesis 50:15 and when Joseph's brothers saw that their father was dead this is at the end of everything they said Joseph will pre-venture hate us and will certainly requite us of all the evil we had done unto him so now they're looking back Joseph's brothers we did this we sold him we were very bad to him you know he he's going to like kill us and and so they were they were scared and they sent a message unto Joseph saying thy father did command before he died saying so shall ye say unto Joseph forgive I pray thee now the trespasses of thy Brethren and their sin for they did unto thee evil and now we pray theee forgive the trespasses of the Servants of God of thy father and Joseph wept when they spake unto him so this is a very a very a very very heartfelt moment here that was going on and his brothers also went in and fell before his face and said beh behold we are thy servants and can you imagine after all the evil that they had done I mean I would think that Joseph probably would have said we're going to get some things straight we're going to straighten this situation out right now because you know you're going to reap what you sld I mean you take you can take the word and make it anything you want but but but but there was something I this is why I like you know Jesus he was the Fulfillment of the law and part of the law isn't just you're you're going to an eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth but it it's going to fulfill the law and and restore and that's the part that people have a hard time living and Joseph said unto them fear not for I am in the place of God but as for you you thought evil against me I know that but God meant it unto good to bring it to pass as it is this day to save much people alive now therefore fear ye not I will nourish you and your little ones and he Comfort them and spake kindly unto them God made everything beautiful beautiful in his time amen there was a season for it amen and and and and it it would take somebody spiritual to be able to look at this situation and really see that that God meant all the bad things that happen for the good and to restore lives and sometimes we have to go through suffering in order for people to be helped to everything there's a season and a time to every purpose under heaven so we have our own purposes in life and God has his purpose in life they're not the same they're absolutely not the same God told balam what to do God knew the purpose and the plan and what to do and you can't curse Israel you can't I mean and have it happen you'll get Cur you'll get the curse that you curse on Israel because you just can't you know God will bless them that bless you God will curse them that are cursy and and but but Baum he was sent with a a he knew the will of God he knew to to to to bless Israel but he had his own purpose knowing the purpose of God so here he was in the purpose of God trying to fulfill it and yet he was working his own purpose in it and it didn't work so we have to understand God has his purpose we have our purpose they're two separate things we can't just say well you know it is it's God's purpose for me to go do this because I want to go do it well I I gave you the list of all the things that I wanted to do and I I have more things I'd like to do but that not the will of God as much as I wanted it's not the will of God and I think I could prosper in those things and so we must understand that God's Eternal purpose his purpose for our life is so much more important than what we would like people can get so involved in their own purposes that they don't even think about God's purpose they just kind of want to drag God into their life as if you know it has to be but God has an eternal purpose that has nothing to do with anything except his eternal purpose God made man in his own image to have Fellowship after his kind and we know what his kind is his kind is to love unconditionally to be completely devoted and committed 1 Corinthians 13 tells the story about Divine love later we learned that the love his the kind His Image his kindness was even to love his enemies which at that point man didn't know about it right no wonder Lucifer thought that he was going to get away with everything because God was just so loving he was kind humble Meek lowly his kind is a servant living for others and redeeming others this is the kind so so when God said let us make man after our kind into like our image we understand this is what God wanted man to be not just a human being not just the outside body but the the inside the character who he [Music] is but God allowed the Fall In the Garden in order to express more of who he really is we have been through this a number of times the sin ful falling condition of man gave opportunity for God to manifest more of who he really is and it does the same thing for us today trials prove who we really are amen we can't say well it would be better if I didn't have a trial somewhere down the road we've got to say I I'm not going to go rob that bank I I'm not going to go up to the window after I get my Quarter Pounder and say you know you made a mistake I ordered to if you don't do something I'm going to do something I'm going to get mad and then they just give it to you because they don't want a problem we just can't think like that so God allowing his children to fall and for us to be born in that same selfish condition God's Eternal purpose has been to restore all of us back to him now this has been God's Eternal purpose before there was a world began I mean this was all in the mind of God and I believe that that God had even hid this from Lucifer at the time I do but see have you ever had some longing in your heart you just held it there you you couldn't even explain it but it was real and God had this real real longing to have a family and who is he going to have a family with I mean can you imagine being married to some Martian some robot some person that has another language has total different interest in you actually hate your guts no there there's nothing there to draw you to that but he had a longing to be to have a a a union with something just like him well where are you going to get that you can't get it anywhere outside of yourself so he took a part of himself and he placed an individuals through history through time and gave opportunities for them to come out he could manifest his love to his bride this is God's Eternal purpose turn with me if you would to Ephesians chap 3:5 Ephesians 3:5 which in other Ages was not made known Unto the Sons of men as it is now revealed unto His Holy Apostles and Prophets by his by the spirit that the Gentile should be fellow heirs and of the same body and partakers of the promise in Christ by the Holy Ghost so we see here that the Jews and the Gentiles are going to be one amen right the same we're the same family and he says whereof I am made a minister according to the gift of the grace of God given unto me by the effectual working of his power unto me who am less than the least of All Saints is this Grace given that I I should preach among the Gentiles The unsearchable Riches of Christ and to make all men see what is the Fellowship of the mystery which from the beginning of the world had been hid in God who created All Things by Jesus Christ but somehow because you're a part of God it was there didn't even know what was going on didn't I can tell you that laying in my bed and and when I was just a teenager boy and I there's got to be a God but having no idea what he is who he is and how I could ever get in contact with him and what he ever be able to see that I really wanted him of course you have those thoughts and then you're dealing with oh I got to give up all this stuff but it's a price you pay it's a price you pay I'm so glad that he placed within us himself and there's that that contact that desire the Deep calling to the Deep one for another God desires to be in you you desire to be in Christ amen it's a love of fair Amen to the intent now unto the principalities and powers in Heavenly places uh might be known by the church the manifold wisdom of God according to the Eternal purpose there it is which he purposed in Christ Jesus our lord in whom we have boldness and access with confidence by faith of him wherefore I desire that you faint not at my tribulation for you which is to your glory for this cause I bow my knees unto the father of our Lord Jesus Christ of whom the whole family in Heaven and Earth is name notice he's talking about the family that he would Grant you according to the riches of his glory to be strengthened with might by the Spirit by his spirit in the inner man that Christ May dwell in your hearts by faith and that you being in rooted and grounded in love may be able to comprehend what it means to be in God's image amen may be able to comprehend with All Saints what is the bread the length the depth and the height and to know the love of Christ which passeth knowledge that you might be filled with all the fullness of god wow this is God's purpose all that God was he poured into Christ all that Christ is he's poured into the church God wants preeminence in the church amen now unto him that is able to do exceedingly above all that we ask or think according to the power that worketh in US unto unto him be glory in the church by Christ Jesus throughout all ages World Without End Amen I I'll tell you that just that just sums it up if we could just stay focused that God wants to get us where we need to get to as a family now I'm sure that you've been in businesses where they've just been out of order you ever just you know order something again at McDonald's and you got somebody else's order you ever get up there and they say did you order a a a cheeseburger and you get up there okay so you ordered the uh fish right no and you're wondering what's the oh okay you ordered this one well has your home ever been out of order but your just you you just desire to get it in order I I mean you you you work on a car and Brother Bruce you've worked on the car and you're just all dirty and greasy you just don't want to like you know come in and just you know eat go to bed like that you want to clean up want to get the body in order and so I just say it like this that God wants his family in order and it's just not a matter of saying oh yeah I'm a member I'm a member of the family no I got I what does God want me to do fit into his purpose God has an eternal purpose that he has been that's been in his heart no wonder God has commissioned he commissioned before he left he said go ye out and preach the gospel to Every Creature because this has been the part of the purpose of God he didn't say you know just go and live a great life and stay out of trouble and try to be an example no preach the gospel to Every Creature we got to get our family together no wonder he sent back the Holy Ghost to be a witness no wonder he gave each of us the ministry of reconciliation and no wonder he makes everything to work out for our good if we are called according to his purpose Romans 8:28 says and we know that all things work together for the good to them that love God to them who are called according to his purpose too often people don't think about the purpose of God and they're just wanting everything to work out for the good sometimes they're not even worried about whether they love God enough and to me I have to look back and I have to say with my life John Martin you have not loved God enough and you have not been more about his purpose that's my testimony that's what I'm going to say about myself and that causes me to press in but if I say that I stand back and I say well I'm going to compare myself with Bob hey Bob you know you're not doing this too hot over there well I'm going to feel pretty good about myself I don't think that is the nature of God I don't think that is verse 29 says for whom we did for no for whom he did Forno he also did predestinate to be conformed to the image remember the image the same desire that God had to make man in his own image to the image of the son of his son that we might be that he might be the firstborn among many Brethren so God isn't off Target of where he was in Genesis chapter 1 he's still on Target and nothing is going to stop his purpose from being fulfilled we understand oh my I we understand I just don't know how much time we're going to have to do everything that I want to do but would just take it one one step at a time God makes everything beautiful in his time he makes all things to work together beautiful in his time that's the ability that God has to take whatever rotten situation and make it work out he's got that ability if number one we love God and we care about we care enough to want to be called to his purpose that we're actively working working at trying to fulfill the will of God in that area Ephesians chap 1:9 Ephesians chap 1:9 having made known I want to try to hurry having made known unto us the mystery of his will according to the good pleasure which he hath purposed in himself that in the dispensation of the fullness of time he might gather together in one all things in Christ both which are in heaven which are in Earth even in him in whom also we have obtained inheritance being predestinated of according to the purpose of him who worketh all things all things after the counsel of his own will you can't stop God the best thing we could do is yield to him that we should be to the praise of his glory who first trusted in Christ now God has a purpose for us to fulfill and sometimes it's hard and we just need to do he said occupy till I come we do need to do that but remember God gave our gave all of us gifts and talents to be used for what his eternal purpose he's expecting us to bring forth him I'm going to tell you I don't think God ever gave me whatever he gave me I don't think he gave me a business so I could take money and say God at the end of the life I really made a a trillion dollar a trillion dollars here it is Lord I'm giving it back to you you can't give a trillion dollars to God you can't he owns a cattle a thousand hills but what you can't give him is what's what is important to him that your life would be sold out to his purpose am to get the family together we all got brothers and sisters we don't even know some of them we don't know many of them by faith we give money overseas by by faith we reach out to somebody who who we don't know we don't know if they don't know Christ we don't know nothing but by faith last Wednesday we we had that that men's meeting reaching out to a young 13-year-old don't know Christ never been in church by faith you're trying to get the family together it's part of the Eternal purpose of God now if you're using your money for that purpose I believe God reckons that but you understand we need we need to yield ourself to God's Eternal purpose not a natural purpose but a spiritual purpose they that win souls is wise and if you let God lead you he will use your natural purpose or your job to fulfill his eternal purpose remember that you do not have a job just to have a job God is Not wasteful God God we know God can use us anywhere anytime he wants to but we need to we need to know that we know that we know that we're here because God had us to be here because that's how you have faith that God can use you where you're at well I feel like preaching this to a thousand people I feel like preaching it to myself it's a truth I believe it with all my heart too often we just look at our our jobs or the things that we do is just jobs and natural things but there but but to me if your heart has been called to God's Eternal purpose then you're just your mind is still right there in God's Eternal purpose where you work and somehow he's going to use that for his eternal purpose I believe it that that's just I believe that with all my heart God has a purpose for us to fulfill and we are the only ones that can fulfill it we're the only ones that can care enough to say Lord show me how to fulfill your Eternal purpose Lord ordain my steps to win souls for thy kingdom Lord direct my life into the image of and likeness that you would have let my heart's desire be for Eternal purpose too often we just forget about God's purpose and we think that's God's business but God has a wife God is a wife somebody brought the truth to you somebody did you can say it was God but I'm telling you it was God through a human being because that's what the word says that's that's what the word says He chose that every seed brings forth of its kind and it works through and so God is just wanting us before the end comes because we're near the end are we not we're we we're near the end we don't know what day we don't know if it's going to be this year but we're running we're running out of time to really you know get some some some more Jews in our crown and I I I was thinking about this and I don't know how that I don't necessarily think this is true but you know how brother B says you're going to be attached to Every Soul somehow in heaven you're going to be attached to Every Soul that you were part of that you either won or help somebody to win I thought how are they going to know what's what and how you know how are you going to know and when you look up at the sky and you see all those stars like kind of like looking at the ceiling here you see that some of them are bigger and brighter and then that there's some that are not quite as bright and I believe that you can do something by putting an offering in the in the plate here that um you know goes to a missionary somehow um something gets left out another person gets it takes it over here goes over somehow it reaches somebody through I don't know how many people that you'll never know and that may not be that star that's as bright as the person that you want to the Lord yourself because I think that's going to be a bright one but still there's an attachment there and I want God to use us we only got a little time left second Corinthians chapter 5:14 for the Lord of For the Love of Christ it constrains us to reach out because we thus judge that if one died for all then we're all dead we shouldn't be living for oursel and that he died for all that they which live should not henceforth live unto themselves but unto him which died for them and rose again wherefore henceforth know we no man after the flesh say though we have known Christ after the flesh yet now henceforth know we am no more so we're just just keeping that out therefore if any of us be really in Christ then we're new creatures and old things are just passed away and behold there's a couple things that are new oh thank you thank you thank you for yes all things not some things let's not be satisfied with some of the things that we got let's to what job I will not be satisfied to I awaken his likeness amen there needs to be something inside of us that we're pressing towards becoming more like Christ like Paul said pressing so if any man be in Christ is new creature all things are passed away behold all things are new and all things are of God who have reconciled us to himself by Jesus Christ and has given to us not a flag of reconciliation not a honor not a not some certificate you put on the wall of reconciliation but we've been given a Ministry of reconciliation Amen to Wi that God was in Christ reconciling the world unto himself not imputing their trespasses unto them and have committed unto us the word of reconciliation amen now then we are ambassadors for Christ has anybody ever dealt with an ambassador well we all know what ambassadors are it it's it's it's a representative of of the country that you're from that's in a foreign a foreign land and we're pilgrims and we're strangers and we're amongst people who are in foreign land they don't know they belong to God yet and God has made us an ambassador to connect them to Christ am and I wonder how many's gone to work yet how many's really left their post of Duty how many's forgot their calling how many's forgot their purpose God has a purpose for us to fulfill this is not just for the preachers if I could say this it's probably less for the preachers I I I'm I'm glad somebody agreed with me on that I I I the first time I ever thought it but I tell you the ministers that they're they're working their their heart their time into the word to bring it forth but but we we sheep uh uh sheep bear the wo right sheep bear sheep and and so I believe we need to be really reaching out to others now nothing can change or alter God's purpose nothing we need to align ourself up with God yield ourselves dedicate ourselves set our affections on things above and then you know God will do the rest he will right he will do the rest he just looking for yielded vessels amen nothing can change God's purpose nothing he makes everything work out for the counsel of his own will Isaiah 5511 nothing can alter God's purpose so shall my word be that goth forth out of my mouth it shall not return to me void but it shall accomplish that which I please and it shall prosper in the thing where unto I sent it so God makes everything beautiful in his time if he sends a word it's not going to return unto him void it's going to prosper in the place that he sent it there is a purpose and nothing can change this purpose from happening you know you have all Heaven behind you when you're when you're ministering to somebody when you're witnessing when you're sharing the love of God oh yeah you may get tomatoes thrown at you you may get persecuted but you still have all Heaven behind you it's the truth well I don't want to offend them brother John that's why I don't do it you're going to offend Jesus Christ then did you hear me you're going to offend Jesus Christ if you don't witness you got to take a stand you can't wait for somebody to come up to you and say I want to know about God he never said that he said go ye out he didn't say let them come in go ye out and so we we we have to be willing to put one step towards what God is calling us to do God spoke his word in Isaiah 7:14 therefore the Lord himself shall give you a sign and behold a virgin shall conceive and bear a son and shall call his name Emmanuel God Is With Us am and 750 years later we know God's word came to pass or thereabouts God's promised word did not return unto him void it accomplished what pleased God it prospered where he sent it and we can say in that scripture that God God prospered and made everything beautiful in his time nothing was going to change that I'm just trying to tell you how important it is to hunger for for God's purpose for your life because God is moving forward I am telling you for all the people that don't want to go to heaven God is still moving forward there's still going to be a heaven there's still going to be a judgment there's still going to be a hell we I will just make sure that we're right there with God Amen and the thing is it's not just well I'm not doing anything bad it's not that it's about God I want to do what you want me to do that's what he's looking for now this beautiful thing that God did he did it in secret he said a virgin shall conceive and bear a son there was no newspaper articles there was no advanced warning that Jesus is coming to town as we heard there was no red carpet rolled out in fact God did not make this a public show but God had ordained before the foundation of the world and yet this great thing happening and God didn't want to be a public show think about that this really tells us about the nature of God God had even purpose to receive praise in this season that it happened so what does he do so what does he do he sends a Heavenly announcement to some pastors the Shepherds right only they knew about it and the Bible says for behold I bring you these angels I bring you good tidings of great joy which shall be to all people for unto you is Born This Day in the city of David which is uh a savior which is Christ the lord and suddenly there was with the angels a multitude of What Not Earthly hosts but Heavenly hosts praising God and saying glory to God in the highest and peace uh on Earth peace and Good Will towards men so this great thing happening or from the foundation of the world all excited kept it a secret and didn't want anybody to know except some Shepherds and the Shepherds saw this praise happening because God wanted praise but he also kept it a secret he didn't want to be a public show God had ordained to receive praise and it came from Heaven itself because the world says did not know him that's what the Bible says he came to his own his own received him not they didn't know him so it was it was it was here God is being B birthed into the world that didn't know him of course he wouldn't receive praise from the world yet yet but but he says but uh he came to his own his own receive not but to as many as did receive and gave he power to become the sons of God and there's where True Praise comes from amen nothing can alter God's purpose if he wasn't to receive praise then he'll have someone to praise him just like he did in heaven I just want to share this little situation that happened when Jesus descended from the Mount of Olives and a multitude of of Jesus followers began to rejoice and praise God with a loud voice for all the money Works he had they had seen saying blessed be the king that cometh in the name of the Lord peace in Earth and glory in the highest and some of the Pharisees from among the multitude said unto them Master rebuke thy disciples and Jesus answered in Luke 19 and said I tell you that if the should hold their peace the stones would immediately cry out in other words nothing is going to alter what God wants nothing if we refuse I'm telling you God's going to make it happen because he spoke and his word will not return void it shall accomplish what it he purposed to it to accomplish nothing can alter God's purpose in Jeremiah chapter 29 is a very familiar scripture but here it was the those that were brought into captivity into into Babylon and they were in a Terri terrible persecuted place they were living in a an area that wasn't uh pure uh Jerusalem pure love pure good things it was a horrible thing and they were without as it were the easy going to church and having freedom and liberty and Jeremiah speaks here uh in 29:1 for I know all the thoughts I think toward you sayeth the Lord thoughts of peace and not of evil to give you in the expected end God does everything beautiful in his time that's what we got to focus on is trusting the end is going to be beautiful then shall you call upon me and you shall go and pray unto me and I will hearken unto you and you shall seek me and find me when you shall search for me with all your heart notice what God is wanting us to do to align ourself align our heart with him and he'll take care of everything else we need to seek to fit in to God's Eternal purpose let it start out by saying God is something I don't think about very much Lord what would you want me to do you see my time you see my my my ability ities you see uh who I can who I'm I'm in contact with just get your heart in your mind aligned in this direction and God will take you to the next step he'll open the doors things will begin to happen because this is on the mind of God more than anything that's on our mind it's been on his mind from the beginning I mean it really was and here let me just say this it's not like a a job that we have to go there and we just you know hey you know you need to just get born again so we can get out of here and get to heaven it's not quite like that God wants to step into your body and manifest the same attributes that he had in him before man fell he wants to manifest that forgiveness that love that joy that longsuffering that wash your feet that servant that giving he wants to do all that inside of your body so it's much more than you got you have to go do this job and you know reach out to this person no there's a the love of God constrains us there's a joy in living for others there's a real Joy there is no joy in being selfish there's none there's none you know people that are selfish I'm going to say this they're miserable they're miserable I want to read the scripture to you because I'm talking about here at the end we're closing now aligning ourself with God's plan for us aligning ourselves with it in 2 Chronicles 7:4 reads If my people which are called by my name shall humble themselves and pray and seek my face and turn from their wicked ways I'll just say our own ways no matter what it is then will I hear from heaven and will forgive their sin and will heal their land and so here it is it isn't it isn't because you know we don't belong to God or somebody doesn't belong to God it just means that we can belong to God and we can get away from where we need to be and this scripture gives me hope that if I just turn towards I I line my life and I I get serious you know it's more than just going to church more than just giving some ties it's giving some money it's more than just trying to be you know nice to somebody but it's really it's it's turning from our selfish living and turning towards God and saying God you have a purpose that's going to last beyond this Earth in in other words when this Earth is over and is burned in and there's a new Heaven and there's a new Earth God's Eternal purpose is still Eternal he's going to be with his family and when we get there wouldn't it be nice to say they're there or somebody else says to you I'm here because of you because you took time out of your your life that you could have done anything you wanted to do with it but you gave all that up to make sure I got in now down here it may not seem that appealing but I'm telling you when this life is over and we're up there it's going to mean everything because that's all there is that's all there is there ain't going to be anything else you know when I was I was a captain in in a hockey team in high school and and I I end up getting a hat trick you know and I I thought that was really cool and I got Trophy and all that stuff but you know that won't even be spoken of in heaven it's it's it's it's we need to focus on the things that God is already focused on let's Stand Together seek God's Eternal purpose God will make everything beautiful in his time I believe this is the season for us to do what needs to be done this is the season don't wait God is coming soon let's sing that little cor Seiki first seek ye first the king kingdom of God and his righteousness
