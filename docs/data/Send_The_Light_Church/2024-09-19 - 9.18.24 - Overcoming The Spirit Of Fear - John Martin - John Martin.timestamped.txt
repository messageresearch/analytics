[34:47] us Lord we're asking that you'd forgive
[34:50] us for the times that we've had evil
[34:51] thoughts towards
[34:53] you the times we thought we were
[34:55] forsaken that we were left behind that
[34:57] we were uncared
[35:00] for because we serve a good god with a
[35:06] testimony you are amazing and yet you
[35:09] are
[35:12] faithful and Lord we're here today with
[35:14] this Thanksgiving inside of our heart
[35:17] today in your house we're recognizing
[35:21] you Lord in your in your glory and we're
[35:25] asking today Lord that you would
[35:28] cleanse us of our sins and our
[35:31] shortcomings wash us with your blood for
[35:34] Lord we want to come in this part of the
[35:38] service just as pure as if we've never
[35:41] ever sinned before because we know you
[35:44] have a word awaiting us
[35:46] Lord Lord we don't want anything to keep
[35:51] the Revelation from coming into our
[35:53] hearts that we might
[35:54] be changed a little bit more into your
[35:57] your image through the
[35:59] word Lord we just pray that you would
[36:02] have the preeminence in the church now
[36:06] bless and anoint your word to each of us
[36:09] may the words that be spoken Lord may
[36:12] they be received as the word of God
[36:15] today for Lord it is you that we are
[36:19] looking to to help
[36:22] us that we might be found Overcomers in
[36:26] this age
[36:28] we love you we thank you for these
[36:30] things and we commit ourself into your
[36:33] hands and the remainder of this service
[36:35] now in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen
[36:40] amen we have two scripture readings
[36:42] quickly before your seated the first is
[36:44] in 2 Timothy chapter 1 and the second is
[36:48] in 1 John chapter
[36:50] 4 second Timothy chapter
[36:55] 1 second in in 1 John chapter
[37:04] 4 and here in 2 Timothy chter 1 verse
[37:08] number 7 reads for God have not given us
[37:12] the spirit of
[37:14] fear but of power and of love and of a
[37:19] sound
[37:20] mind amen and then 1 John chapter
[37:24] 4 verse number eight
[37:31] 1 John 4 verse number
[37:37] 18 there is no fear in love but perfect
[37:42] love cast out fear because fear have
[37:45] torment and he that feareth is really
[37:50] not made perfect in love amen God bless
[37:53] you may be
[37:55] seated and as long as you're saying Amen
[37:58] to the word I I will not ask you to
[38:00] stand
[38:05] up we want to speak on the subject
[38:08] overcoming the spirit of
[38:12] fear and I want us to kind of look at
[38:14] this you know we all
[38:17] are deal with fear in all sorts of way
[38:21] and fear can get a hold of a man's life
[38:23] so strong that it actually affects his
[38:26] body and be began to change the
[38:28] chemistry of his body and can cause
[38:31] sicknesses and all sorts of things all
[38:35] because of fear amen so fear we we we're
[38:38] real uh re um familiar with but the
[38:43] spirit of fear is what I want to to kind
[38:46] of focus on because that is the origin
[38:48] right and we want to really talk about
[38:53] overcoming this spirit of fear now now
[38:57] the fear of the Lord and the spirit of
[38:59] fear are two completely different
[39:02] Spirits we're taught in the Bible that
[39:04] the fear that we're to fear the lord and
[39:08] to fear him that is able to destroy both
[39:11] soul and Body in Hell the fear of the
[39:14] Lord is the beginning of wisdom amen the
[39:17] fear of the Lord is what cleans up a
[39:18] man's life it is the fear of the Lord
[39:20] that makes a man to crucify his own will
[39:24] it is the fear of the Lord that brings
[39:26] us to a
[39:28] closer a more harmonious relationship
[39:32] with God it is the fear of God that does
[39:34] that it is the fear of the Lord that
[39:36] initiates the new birth and not only
[39:38] initiates the new birth but it carries
[39:41] us through the process of the new birth
[39:42] into the statue of the perfect man
[39:44] anytime the fear of the Lord
[39:47] leaves then we can't
[39:51] grow now without the fear of the Lord in
[39:53] a man's life he is literally driven by
[39:56] his own
[39:58] will so we can say that the fear of the
[40:01] Lord is the respect that we have for God
[40:05] Amen that we we reverence the word we
[40:07] believe that what he's saying that he he
[40:09] really means that he's not somebody that
[40:11] just well he says something and it's
[40:13] okay if you don't do it he really wants
[40:15] us to do
[40:16] it it is a
[40:18] reverence that He is wanting us to
[40:22] exercise in his house he wants us to
[40:26] reverence his house but not only his
[40:28] house he wants us to reverence how we
[40:31] talk and how we act and how we conduct
[40:34] our lives he he wants to see the fear of
[40:38] the Lord uh always being projected with
[40:43] our
[40:46] lives the fear of the Lord is is
[40:48] something that operates only through
[40:50] freeor agency it only operates through
[40:54] self- willingness our choice our desire
[40:56] our will whereas the spirit of fear is
[40:59] something that is forced upon us against
[41:01] our will against what we
[41:04] want the two Spirits they operate by
[41:07] different by different channels one is I
[41:11] present to you my
[41:13] will I present to you uh uh this is the
[41:18] way I want you to walk ye in it amen and
[41:21] the other says you know what I don't
[41:25] want you to read the Bible I don't want
[41:27] you to pray and I'm going to force all
[41:30] sorts of things on you you don't got
[41:32] time to do
[41:33] it see it's it's a
[41:39] manipulation basically the spirit of
[41:41] fear comes to us if we like it or not
[41:44] it's
[41:45] there so we need to pay close attention
[41:48] to this God has allowed this fear to
[41:52] exist in the world that we live in
[41:57] the spirit of fear is like an alarm it's
[42:00] a a a a fright a terror and its job is
[42:05] to to make us to dread or worry about
[42:07] something to stress or be anxious about
[42:10] something it it causes us even to Panic
[42:13] or to get into a state of anxiety all
[42:16] because of the spirit of fear
[42:19] amen it may come to us as a a
[42:23] thought but we have a choice on where
[42:26] we're going to do with our
[42:29] thought we can say fear is an unpleasant
[42:33] feeling that's triggered by the
[42:35] perception of danger whether it is a
[42:38] real thing or something that's
[42:43] unimaginable and the job of the spirit
[42:45] of fear is to trigger our perception of
[42:48] danger through
[42:50] manipulation in other words this
[42:52] situation happens and we think oh the
[42:54] Bottom's going to fall out is it
[42:57] see it it it it wants to trick our
[43:00] perception we've heard people say that
[43:03] um well we might even said it they know
[43:06] how to push my
[43:08] button are you are are you with me okay
[43:12] it's it's it's that I know it's
[43:15] coming they act a certain way say
[43:18] something wrong to us and it can trigger
[43:20] us to say and do
[43:22] things that really we would be doing
[43:25] without the mind and the love of God God
[43:27] Amen remember the prophet said it's not
[43:30] the action that happens to us but it's
[43:32] how we're going to react that is really
[43:35] what's important to God that's what he's
[43:36] looking
[43:37] at in short when we yield to fear then
[43:41] it will most likely produce us to act in
[43:46] fear and to start using fear on other
[43:49] people because we're scared ourself
[43:52] we're afraid of something so we need to
[43:54] manipulate a certain situation
[43:57] and the Bible says to whom you yield
[43:59] yourself servants his servant you are no
[44:01] no matter what
[44:03] direction say someone cuts us off in
[44:05] traffic that ever happened to
[44:07] you it can trigger an unhealthy per
[44:11] perception of
[44:12] danger amen they shouldn't have done
[44:15] that that was rude that was mean that
[44:17] was
[44:19] careless and and and actually driving
[44:22] can trigger road rage
[44:24] anger driving somebody off the road
[44:27] fighting shaking your hand we even heard
[44:30] of shootings happening all because of
[44:33] road
[44:35] rage so you understand this this Fear
[44:40] Can escalate that's its job it's to
[44:43] trigger our perception of danger by
[44:45] manipulating our minds about what's
[44:47] going on and getting us to think that
[44:51] God is not in control of our
[44:55] situation amen
[44:58] because if he can do that he can get us
[45:02] to start trying to take a carnal control
[45:04] of a situation amen outside of the great
[45:08] thing that we should be doing which is
[45:09] trusting
[45:13] God people who have got real problems
[45:16] with anger actually go to anger
[45:20] management to help them to better
[45:25] cope I remember someone driving along
[45:27] with me when I was in the car and this
[45:28] has happened a number of times with me
[45:30] driving and someone would cut me off do
[45:33] something wrong and the person sitting
[45:35] in the car next to me and say well why
[45:37] didn't you just beat the horn why'd you
[45:38] let him do that why don't you let him
[45:47] know it
[45:52] happens all I need to do is beat my horn
[45:55] then then they get scared and then else
[45:57] happens and then we both get in an
[45:58] accident
[46:00] right God has not given us the spirit of
[46:04] fear amen the spirit of fear brings fear
[46:09] to us and then we begin to be a a
[46:11] servant of fear and everything we're
[46:13] doing is with
[46:15] fear and we can get to a place in our
[46:18] lives honestly that our life is just
[46:21] full of fear and not even realize it
[46:23] motivated by fear making most of our
[46:26] decisions because of the fear that's on
[46:29] us that we we we wouldn't make the
[46:32] decision the same way if we just had the
[46:35] peace of God Amen and in Luke 21 if you
[46:39] like to turn there with me or we'll put
[46:40] it up on the board here uh describes
[46:44] that there will be signs of the coming
[46:46] of the Lord now to to us who look for
[46:50] him when he appears who love his
[46:52] appearing it's exciting amen but for
[46:56] everybody else who's looking at the
[46:57] signs of his coming it's bringing a
[47:02] fear and it says in verse 25 and there
[47:04] shall be signs in the sun and the moon
[47:06] and the stars and upon the Earth
[47:08] distress of nations with perplexity in
[47:10] the sea and and waves
[47:13] roaring men's Hearts failing them for
[47:17] one reason for fear and what is this
[47:21] fear stemming from from them looking
[47:25] after those things which are coming upon
[47:28] the
[47:29] Earth for the powers of Heaven shall be
[47:34] shaken in other words God is going to
[47:37] allow
[47:40] it men's Hearts
[47:44] failing there think about this the devil
[47:47] is stronger than any man's
[47:50] heart and if he can
[47:52] manipulate
[47:55] people who to get a a a perception that
[47:59] there is a danger in front of them that
[48:01] God is not going to handle for their
[48:04] life then they feel that it's okay to
[48:07] step out in fear and
[48:09] just go crazy and feel Justified about
[48:13] it verse 27 and then shall they see the
[48:18] son of man coming in a cloud with power
[48:20] and great Glory verse verse 34 and take
[48:23] heed to
[48:24] yourselves last at any time your heart
[48:28] be overcharged and there's
[48:31] this overcharged with surfing and
[48:34] drunkenness and the cares of this life
[48:36] and so that day doesn't come upon you
[48:38] unaware so now he's saying all these
[48:40] things are going to be happening out
[48:42] there people are going to be looking at
[48:44] this and you need to be to be walking
[48:47] with a love for
[48:52] me for as a
[48:54] snare shall it come
[48:57] on all them that dwell on the face of
[49:00] the whole earth now we've all
[49:02] seen movies or stories where somebody's
[49:06] you know walking through a jungle or
[49:08] somewhere and all of a sudden they step
[49:11] on something and the the the either they
[49:14] fall into a hole or the Rope gets tied
[49:16] up and they go upside down and they're
[49:19] hanging it's a called a
[49:22] snare unawares that it was
[49:25] there and so many people on this planet
[49:29] the whole earth is everybody but the
[49:31] bride is going to fall into the
[49:34] snare so he says here watch ye therefore
[49:37] here's the remedy here's the
[49:41] remedy and pray
[49:44] always well I'm not really wanting to
[49:47] pray very I'm you're going to get in big
[49:50] trouble men ought to always pray and not
[49:53] faint watch ye therefore get used to
[49:56] praying get used to praying make that
[49:58] part of your your time until you're out
[50:00] of here it isn't just something that we
[50:01] need to do now for a couple weeks and
[50:03] call it quits no it needs to become part
[50:05] of our life watch you therefore pray
[50:08] always that you may be counted worthy
[50:11] accounted worthy to escape all these
[50:13] things that are come to pass and stand
[50:15] before the son of man in other words
[50:16] when God sees you praying he'll he'll
[50:19] take care of
[50:20] you he says you're worthy you're praying
[50:23] you're worthy I'm going to show you amen
[50:27] now we're not just fearing what's going
[50:29] to happen to our country and we know
[50:31] even um uh the the
[50:35] uh
[50:37] don't don't want to ever bring up
[50:39] politics but we know that President
[50:40] Trump has said look if we get one more
[50:44] if if if if we have one more uh thing
[50:48] one more what am I trying to say brother
[50:50] one more term that's the word I'm
[50:53] looking for one more term we're going
[50:55] under we're going down
[50:58] because there's this
[51:00] perception of we are going down
[51:02] everybody sees it it's weird how nobody
[51:06] really so many people don't care about
[51:07] it or so many people are blind to
[51:10] it but we're not just fearing what's
[51:12] going to happen to our country but we
[51:15] face every day in our personal lives
[51:22] fear in almost
[51:25] everything this spirit of fear is
[51:28] real and we come face to face with it
[51:32] all the time every
[51:35] day I'm wondering if they're going to
[51:38] mess up my order
[51:40] again so we got the countertops done we
[51:43] got the the sinks done and oh I woke up
[51:46] this morning I'm going to show Stan how
[51:48] to put these sinks in get the sink I put
[51:51] it on there and it's almost it's the
[51:53] wrong sink I didn't know it at the time
[51:56] but I found out it was the wrong thing
[51:58] they sent the wrong sink and so I'm
[52:00] talking to him today I said well can I
[52:02] ask to duplicate that order can you tell
[52:04] me why you sent a different sink uh no I
[52:08] can't that's the end of the story really
[52:10] doesn't matter at this point we need new
[52:13] sinks I wonder if they're going to mess
[52:15] up my
[52:15] order wonder if they're going to cancel
[52:18] on me again I made a a time to get
[52:20] together with them I wonder if they're
[52:21] going to cancel on me again I wonder if
[52:23] they're going to move my appointment
[52:25] after I went through all this
[52:28] beer I wonder how he or she is going to
[52:32] be when they walk through that door
[52:34] today I wonder how they're going to
[52:36] react when they find out about
[52:39] this when they have to deal with this
[52:44] situation when the boss finds out when
[52:46] Mom and Dad finds
[52:48] out I wonder what's what we're going to
[52:51] do without money without insurance
[52:52] without a car without without
[52:55] help fear
[52:58] Fear Can attack us even at the
[53:00] restaurant I'm going to say it like this
[53:02] before you get to the
[53:04] restaurant I'm unsure what what to order
[53:07] when we get
[53:09] there I'm looking at the menu and
[53:11] there's so many choices there is it's
[53:13] it's it's so hard what shall I what
[53:16] shall I choose for dinner
[53:19] tonight I don't know so I'm asking you
[53:22] what do I want
[53:26] what if I don't like it what if I have
[53:29] to eat something that I don't
[53:32] like like as kids we did it all our life
[53:34] when our mom and dad said it there but
[53:38] why we face that is such a horrible fear
[53:40] I don't
[53:41] know well to be honest with you I face
[53:44] fear all the
[53:47] time the fear of disappointing
[53:51] someone the fear that the shop cannot
[53:54] continue on successfully without me
[53:58] the fear that I will not be able to do
[54:00] everything that's in my heart to
[54:03] do so fear is a real thing and we face
[54:07] it
[54:08] daily and we need to remember that this
[54:11] spirit is not from Heaven
[54:15] am yet God has allowed it to purposely
[54:19] be there amen God has orchestrated the
[54:21] spirit of fear to be among us to be a
[54:25] part of what he wants you and I to face
[54:27] every day the spirit of fear is not here
[54:31] by some crazy mistake that God made or
[54:34] or Satan pulled a fast one over God God
[54:37] wants the spirit of fear here today as
[54:41] much as he allowed it in heaven and as
[54:42] much as he allowed it in the Garden of
[54:45] Eden but I'll say this to you God has
[54:48] confidence in his own
[54:50] seed they will not be succumbed by the
[54:53] spirit of fear amen David knew that he
[54:56] walked alongside of fear all the time
[55:00] David knew that God had allowed the
[55:02] spirit of fear around
[55:03] him but he also knew who he was and who
[55:06] he belonged to and the seed of God does
[55:08] not have to fear anything anytime
[55:11] anywhere for any
[55:13] reason because God has not given us the
[55:16] spirit of fear but of power and love and
[55:19] a sound mind
[55:21] amen David didn't fear the bear he
[55:25] didn't fear the lion
[55:27] he didn't feel G but I'm telling you all
[55:29] three of these produced a fear and it
[55:32] was
[55:35] there but he did not allow what was
[55:38] standing in front of him to come and
[55:41] manipulate his mind of what is now about
[55:45] to
[55:47] happen see we have we've gotten to the
[55:50] point I think that we just anything that
[55:53] comes into our head we don't try the
[55:55] spirit right and see whether it be of
[55:58] God or
[55:58] not but I'm telling you you need to try
[56:01] the spirit every spirit because a lot of
[56:04] times it's a spirit of fear it ain't
[56:05] even real what I'm saying it isn't it it
[56:09] it's spirit of fear is real but it isn't
[56:11] real for
[56:13] you because God don't want you to
[56:16] inhabit but I just look at David's
[56:19] attitude here in Psalms 27:1 he said the
[56:23] Lord is my shepherd I'm sorry the Lord
[56:25] is my light my salvation Whom Shall I
[56:32] Fear you know if the light is really
[56:34] shined on your
[56:36] situation that this is this is all this
[56:39] is you remember the story about uh The
[56:41] Wizard of Oz and everybody thought it
[56:44] was some you know thing out and we find
[56:46] it's a little guy behind the
[56:49] curtain well if God is shining the light
[56:52] on the situation you should better have
[56:54] full trust amen
[56:57] amen he's going to save you out of this
[56:59] situation amen he's my salvation Whom
[57:03] Shall I Fear the Lord is the strength of
[57:06] my life that's right and whom shall I be
[57:08] afraid well brother John and I haven't
[57:10] felt very strong in the Lord okay it's
[57:12] real simple it's not difficult it's not
[57:15] hard the book says they that wait upon
[57:18] the
[57:19] Lord got to get back to what God wants
[57:22] you to
[57:24] do we must come to grips that God has
[57:27] allowed the spirit to be around us even
[57:31] to the end of the
[57:34] world but we we have a choice to be
[57:38] quietly confident in
[57:41] God we have that
[57:44] choice so in other words God wants you
[57:46] to stand up against the spirit of fear
[57:49] Amen to stand up against it to say no
[57:52] this is not part of me you may be
[57:55] speaking to in my mind but I don't
[57:57] accept it verse two when the wicked even
[58:00] my enemies and my foes They Came Upon me
[58:04] to to uh to eat up my flesh they
[58:07] stumbled and they
[58:08] fell in other words God takes care of
[58:13] your
[58:14] enemies when you trust in
[58:16] him and he said though a host should
[58:20] encamp against me everywhere you know
[58:23] what I am choosing I am choosing my
[58:25] heart heart shall not
[58:28] fear David was not saying I am some
[58:31] great
[58:33] guy all he said is I serve a great God
[58:37] there's the
[58:39] difference he had faith in the God that
[58:42] he served amen it wasn't some
[58:45] religion amen it was a it was a
[58:50] relationship though War should Rise
[58:53] Against Me In This Will I be
[58:59] confident you have a choice are you
[59:01] going to be confident in God or are you
[59:04] going to believe the lie of the devil
[59:06] because God has not given us the spirit
[59:08] of
[59:09] fear this is a choice that David had and
[59:13] he stood there facing the fears that
[59:16] came to his mind now we see in the Old
[59:20] Testament these were just the not just
[59:22] these are all natural battles going on
[59:25] that he had to face
[59:26] right now in the New Testament we're
[59:29] facing all the spiritual one they're
[59:31] like that guy's acting like a lion that
[59:34] girl's acting like a a a a bear a and
[59:39] and and that's a real that's a real
[59:41] giant situation happening you don't
[59:46] understand God allowed that
[59:49] there he wants that to be there he
[59:52] doesn't want you tormented but he wants
[59:55] it there because he wants you to
[59:59] overcome to overcome it he ain't going
[1:00:02] to take it away from you you're going to
[1:00:05] have to overcome it God never took the
[1:00:07] Giants out of the promised land he said
[1:00:09] go in there they're
[1:00:11] nothing and you got to believe
[1:00:17] it we have a
[1:00:22] choice we got to believe that God is
[1:00:25] with us in every situation all right
[1:00:26] Psalms 23:4 Psalms 23:4 says
[1:00:31] yay though I
[1:00:34] personally walk through the valley of
[1:00:36] the shadow of
[1:00:38] death I will fear no evil look it's it's
[1:00:41] a
[1:00:43] choice for for thou are with me thy rod
[1:00:46] and thy staff they comfort me why why
[1:00:49] aren't you going to fear why aren't you
[1:00:50] going to fear
[1:00:52] anymore
[1:00:53] because you are testified fine God is
[1:00:57] with
[1:00:58] me I'm going to testify hey you're
[1:01:00] either going to testify God is with me
[1:01:02] or you're going to say I don't know
[1:01:03] about this one I don't this is different
[1:01:07] you know you say that is different every
[1:01:09] single day it becomes different and then
[1:01:11] pretty soon every day it's all about
[1:01:13] fear you got to take a stand against the
[1:01:16] spirit of fear amen and look God wants
[1:01:20] us here he said thou preparest a table
[1:01:23] before me in the presence of my enemies
[1:01:26] thou anointest my head with oil my cup
[1:01:28] rolling so here we are sitting in
[1:01:31] church and you know what fear is all
[1:01:35] around
[1:01:36] us but God said it's okay it's allowed
[1:01:39] to
[1:01:40] stay it's allowed to
[1:01:43] stay I'm I'm even giving you the
[1:01:48] word that you can overcome fear
[1:01:52] Amen in other words I'm not going to
[1:01:55] kick Judah out of the
[1:01:58] discipleship I'm not going to do
[1:02:02] that he has a
[1:02:04] purpose the devil has a purpose fear has
[1:02:07] a purpose the thing
[1:02:09] is it's not going to come n this
[1:02:12] dwelling that's the only thing right
[1:02:14] there there's where the you put down you
[1:02:17] put your foot down that's where David
[1:02:19] put his foot
[1:02:22] down the devil is allowed to be where
[1:02:26] wherever God allows him to but he can't
[1:02:28] come inside our mind our hearts because
[1:02:31] this is the Temple of the Holy Ghost
[1:02:37] right surely goodness and mercy shall
[1:02:42] follow me all the days of my life and I
[1:02:43] will dwell in the house of the Lord
[1:02:45] forever yeah fear is going to be all
[1:02:48] around me I'm going to walk through the
[1:02:49] valley shadow of deal my my enemies all
[1:02:51] this is going to happen but you know
[1:02:53] what so is goodness going to follow me
[1:02:55] amen God is with me it doesn't matter
[1:02:58] God is with me amen we've got to believe
[1:03:01] that for our lives Psalms 56:2 says my
[1:03:06] enemies would daily swallow me up for
[1:03:10] they be
[1:03:11] many that fight against me oh thou most
[1:03:16] high what time I am afraid I will choose
[1:03:22] to trust in thee amen
[1:03:28] look if you don't make the right choice
[1:03:31] then you're succumb by the fear and then
[1:03:33] now you're operating by fear and you're
[1:03:36] unsure about things and fear will stay
[1:03:40] there as long as you allow it you have
[1:03:42] to cast it out you have to cast it out
[1:03:46] you have to say get behind me
[1:03:50] Satan get out of my mind get out of my
[1:03:53] thoughts I let you in too long wrong I'm
[1:03:56] taking a stand you're not going to
[1:03:58] manipulate me
[1:03:59] anymore Isaiah 12:2 Isaiah 12:2 says
[1:04:03] behold God is my
[1:04:06] salvation I will
[1:04:08] trust and I will not be afraid
[1:04:14] right
[1:04:16] now this seems to be
[1:04:19] easy on
[1:04:22] paper but it was just as hard for day or
[1:04:25] for for for Isaiah and and for David is
[1:04:28] for you and
[1:04:34] I when we trust God what we're doing is
[1:04:37] we're showing we're pleasing him without
[1:04:39] faith you it's impossible to please God
[1:04:41] so when you you take that stand and you
[1:04:43] say I'm going to trust God in the middle
[1:04:44] of this turmoil that's going on right
[1:04:46] now
[1:04:50] amen I'm going to choose to trust God
[1:04:53] Amen you know something had happened
[1:04:57] this is the truth I also say
[1:05:00] it so I'm going over the the weekly
[1:05:03] what's you know what's happening in in
[1:05:05] our finances which I do every week
[1:05:08] and and I don't even remember this until
[1:05:11] I had borrowed money we were literally
[1:05:14] and I looked at it earlier this week we
[1:05:17] were literally in the negative that just
[1:05:19] doesn't happen at trusted
[1:05:21] tool so we had money that hadn't come in
[1:05:28] yet but it was still an an un it wasn't
[1:05:31] balanced it wasn't right and I you know
[1:05:34] haven't been there all as much as I'd
[1:05:36] like because I've
[1:05:38] been I've been doing some other things
[1:05:40] for Cheryl and things like that with a
[1:05:42] greenhous and
[1:05:45] um so I in my prayer I just said this
[1:05:48] simple prayer
[1:05:53] Lord just take care of that
[1:05:58] that was it walked in today and all a
[1:06:00] sudden we got 30,000 in
[1:06:04] there but that was just only thought I
[1:06:07] had about this there was no fear but the
[1:06:09] only thought I had was just say a prayer
[1:06:13] and it was that simple there was no
[1:06:15] pleading there's no there was because
[1:06:17] there God has proved himself so much to
[1:06:20] me and if look you can stand up and
[1:06:24] testify God has done so much for you you
[1:06:27] should be able to trust him for what's
[1:06:29] going
[1:06:32] on when fear suddenly
[1:06:36] comes oh I want to finish reading that
[1:06:38] can I do that this I love this Isaiah 12
[1:06:41] vers to behold God is my salvation I
[1:06:43] will trust and not be afraid for the
[1:06:45] Lord Jehovah is my strength and my
[1:06:48] song uh he also is become my salvation
[1:06:53] in this situation therefore
[1:06:57] well with joy shall I shall ye draw
[1:07:01] water out of the wells of Salvation am
[1:07:05] look salvation just wasn't for you when
[1:07:07] you got saved there is there is so much
[1:07:10] that water that we can draw from and be
[1:07:12] safe from so many
[1:07:14] situations and we're supposed to have
[1:07:16] Joy about it he's done it before he'll
[1:07:19] do it
[1:07:20] again but we need to have that
[1:07:22] confidence and we need to we need to
[1:07:24] feed that confidence and walk with that
[1:07:26] confidence and not allow the spirit of
[1:07:29] fear to have its way in our
[1:07:32] life so when fear comes suddenly comes
[1:07:35] knocking comes tormenting remember
[1:07:37] always remember you have a choice in the
[1:07:41] matter to trust God Amen now here's
[1:07:44] where the devil gets so many people what
[1:07:45] are you going to do about what's going
[1:07:47] to happen what if what if what if you
[1:07:48] know what he does he tries to give you
[1:07:50] the 20
[1:07:51] questionnaire that's what he does
[1:07:54] because he knows you can't answer
[1:07:56] them so there is one one answer that's
[1:08:02] perfect for everyone I trust God Amen
[1:08:06] and that's all I need to do I trust God
[1:08:10] I don't need to know anything else Jesus
[1:08:13] Christ he's crucified that's all I know
[1:08:15] I have a love relationship with him he's
[1:08:17] taking care of me he never told me
[1:08:19] Midway you're going to have to start
[1:08:20] taking care of yourself
[1:08:23] again as long as we can continue to put
[1:08:26] him first God will hold up his end of
[1:08:27] the bargain the moment we stop doing
[1:08:30] what we need to do it's a conditional
[1:08:32] promise seek ye first the kingdom and
[1:08:34] all the things will be added to you
[1:08:37] am to continue on in fear remember this
[1:08:41] is a
[1:08:43] choice you can't say well yeah this
[1:08:45] happened and this and and you know it's
[1:08:48] still like you know hasn't happened yet
[1:08:50] and it still you know bother me and then
[1:08:52] this and and then that I'm telling you
[1:08:55] you have made a choice to be there yes
[1:08:58] don't tell me you haven't and you can't
[1:09:00] tell God there you cannot
[1:09:04] fear the fear the fearful go to the same
[1:09:08] place that's what that's what that's
[1:09:10] what the Bible says the fearful goes to
[1:09:13] the same place as the
[1:09:16] unbelieving so we can't just you know
[1:09:19] say it's okay to fear no it's not tell
[1:09:22] the devil where he belongs amen tell the
[1:09:25] devil where you're standing
[1:09:28] amen you know when the angel would
[1:09:31] appear to humans to to God's people they
[1:09:34] would often say fear
[1:09:36] not in other words you got a
[1:09:39] choice you're you're you're startled
[1:09:41] you're but but fear not you have a
[1:09:44] choice I am here to tell you you have a
[1:09:46] choice fear
[1:09:48] not I love
[1:09:51] it David said what time I am afraid I
[1:09:54] will trust the I will choose to trust
[1:09:56] God Isaiah said I will trust and not be
[1:09:59] afraid Isaiah had a choice and we have a
[1:10:03] choice and I know what I'm saying this
[1:10:06] is that I'm actually putting a little
[1:10:08] pressure on on
[1:10:10] you holding yourself
[1:10:13] accountable to stand up and say okay I'm
[1:10:17] not going to give into this fear but we
[1:10:19] got to do that you can't wait till
[1:10:21] everything D settles you got all your
[1:10:23] needs met you got a million dollars in
[1:10:25] the bank your health is there everything
[1:10:27] is going great okay I don't fear no more
[1:10:30] that don't work like that you're God's
[1:10:33] children God allowed fear to be here and
[1:10:35] you're an overcomer amen you're an
[1:10:37] overcomer that's it you just trust God
[1:10:39] for that the fact that God does not hand
[1:10:43] out fear yet he has even orchestrated it
[1:10:47] to remain that means he must want us to
[1:10:50] Simply overcome it
[1:10:53] right so instead just wishing it wasn't
[1:10:56] here and getting rid of it what we just
[1:10:57] do what God wants us to do right
[1:11:00] overcome
[1:11:02] amen when we're getting attacked nope
[1:11:05] not
[1:11:06] me remember you have a
[1:11:12] choice we're not going to allow fear to
[1:11:15] enter our minds and our hearts or we're
[1:11:18] going to choose to trust God fear is a
[1:11:20] tactic of the devil that he uses to
[1:11:23] actually paralyze the minds of people
[1:11:27] what what is it it just you know if you
[1:11:29] just think about this there are certain
[1:11:30] snakes out there they will they will
[1:11:33] paralyze
[1:11:36] you and we know that Satan is just some
[1:11:39] serpent
[1:11:41] right and so fear comes and he he just
[1:11:45] brings this
[1:11:47] thought this could happen and it kind of
[1:11:51] paralyzes you what does it
[1:11:53] do it causes you to lose
[1:12:00] hope like God is not big enough to take
[1:12:03] care of this God is big enough to take
[1:12:05] care of
[1:12:08] anything is anything too hard for
[1:12:15] God so we understand he's got this
[1:12:18] poison and this poison is he traps you
[1:12:21] into thinking things can't change
[1:12:25] and he does it through manipulating us
[1:12:29] manipulating
[1:12:33] us God's not with you right now you know
[1:12:36] what you're on your
[1:12:42] own these same Devils get on people and
[1:12:46] cause people to manipulate others into
[1:12:49] what they want right okay so we went
[1:12:52] from the devil speaking to us now devil
[1:12:54] is somebody
[1:12:58] else acting like the devil and if it's
[1:13:00] not we're not careful that Spirit can
[1:13:02] get on us and then we'll start
[1:13:04] manipulating
[1:13:05] others it's through
[1:13:08] fear
[1:13:11] right some of you get full of the spirit
[1:13:13] of fear because you know you didn't get
[1:13:17] dinner done on time you didn't do my
[1:13:19] laundry you didn't well you're bad it's
[1:13:23] all your fault you knew better you're
[1:13:25] dumb you're stupid you're an idiot
[1:13:27] they'll they'll swear they'll
[1:13:30] curse they'll chew them out get so mad
[1:13:33] and
[1:13:34] anger why are people acting like that
[1:13:38] one
[1:13:39] reason because a spirit of fear got on
[1:13:45] them a spirit of
[1:13:52] fear now they would never admit that but
[1:13:55] that's why because if that fear wasn't
[1:13:58] there there would be no need to
[1:14:01] manipulate there'd be it's it's time to
[1:14:03] pray honey it's time to trust it's time
[1:14:07] to take this before
[1:14:10] God oh you've never been you'll never
[1:14:13] amount to
[1:14:14] nothing throw your hands up in the
[1:14:20] air walk out you ever done that ever
[1:14:23] seen somebody do that now look I knew
[1:14:25] there would be some things in here that
[1:14:27] would kind of
[1:14:28] Sting but I'm just being honest with
[1:14:33] you if we don't want to recognize the
[1:14:35] spirit of fear on
[1:14:37] us how are we ever going to overcome
[1:14:41] it it's not just the spirit that speaks
[1:14:44] to our minds it's the spirit that gets
[1:14:46] on us and then we start projecting a
[1:14:48] manipulation towards
[1:14:52] others fear paralyzes the minds of
[1:14:55] others so they can't handle situations
[1:14:58] right they don't know how to just
[1:15:00] soberly quietly
[1:15:02] say God's got this I'm not sure how it's
[1:15:05] going to happen but God's got it what
[1:15:07] we're going to do is we're going to
[1:15:10] pray the same fear that the Devils use
[1:15:13] on us when we're alone is the same fear
[1:15:16] the devil uses through others to
[1:15:18] manipulate us into some kind of hopeless
[1:15:21] condition feeling
[1:15:26] like you don't have any power like you
[1:15:28] don't have any any strength any any
[1:15:33] Sayo and makes you feel
[1:15:37] worthless come on men's Hearts failing
[1:15:42] them for fear right amen as a snare it
[1:15:45] shall come upon all them that dwell upon
[1:15:47] the Earth watch ye therefore and
[1:15:52] pray don't try to overcome fear without
[1:15:55] God you are not stronger you are not
[1:15:58] greater you are not better you need God
[1:16:01] you need God on the
[1:16:04] inside fear is allowed to exist and it's
[1:16:08] allowed to stay around but it's not
[1:16:10] allowed to be inside of
[1:16:13] us not allowed to be in our
[1:16:16] minds we need to get back to prayer
[1:16:20] amen I always remember hearing brother
[1:16:22] Johnson say this
[1:16:25] a praying man he said would never hurt
[1:16:29] you if a man that prays or a woman that
[1:16:33] prays in the
[1:16:34] spirit will not hurt
[1:16:38] you just won't
[1:16:41] happen we're not ignorant of the devil's
[1:16:45] devices we don't fight against flesh and
[1:16:48] blood we become more
[1:16:52] acute more sensitive to what's happening
[1:16:54] in the spiritual realm when we're sober
[1:16:56] when we're Vigilant when we pray because
[1:16:59] the the devil is out there seeking whom
[1:17:01] he may devour but he cannot devour
[1:17:05] me because I choose to walk with the
[1:17:10] Lord Prayer not only opens our eyes to
[1:17:12] see others trying to manipulate us but
[1:17:14] it also opens our eyes to recognize the
[1:17:16] devil is
[1:17:18] using to manipulate
[1:17:23] us see
[1:17:25] imagine for a moment the devil could no
[1:17:28] longer speak to our minds but he was
[1:17:32] able to use everybody else to get to
[1:17:36] us he could just take his hands off and
[1:17:40] there' be confusion and problems and
[1:17:45] Chaos so it's not just the
[1:17:48] thoughts we need to recognize the enemy
[1:17:51] trying to manipulate us through other
[1:17:53] people
[1:17:56] I want to make this statement as we get
[1:17:57] into trying to wrap this up with
[1:18:00] overcoming fear just as oil and water
[1:18:03] cannot mix fear and perfect love cannot
[1:18:10] coexist fear and human love are
[1:18:14] interwoven
[1:18:15] together they mix and they can
[1:18:19] exist fear and human love coexist all
[1:18:23] the time
[1:18:25] but not fear and perfect
[1:18:28] love it's
[1:18:31] impossible Divine love trumps
[1:18:40] fear
[1:18:42] see the scripture tells us that perfect
[1:18:44] love cast out
[1:18:47] fear
[1:18:51] so the key when we're so worked up we're
[1:18:54] so
[1:18:55] bothered is not to get that situation
[1:18:58] straightened out not to put that person
[1:19:00] in their
[1:19:01] place not to not to tell them they're
[1:19:04] off and they're wrong and they shouldn't
[1:19:05] have and prove that ain't how you get
[1:19:08] rid of fear you get rid of fear by
[1:19:12] perfect love amen Divine
[1:19:14] love not just human love well I'm going
[1:19:17] to try to love this person a little bit
[1:19:19] more through
[1:19:20] this that ain't going to cast anything
[1:19:23] out
[1:19:25] but when exactly it will make it worth
[1:19:27] because it's it's confusing it'll go so
[1:19:29] far then it quits and it
[1:19:32] stops there is no fear in love but
[1:19:36] perfect love casteth out fear because
[1:19:38] fear has torment and he that fearth is
[1:19:40] not made
[1:19:42] perfect there's no fear in love they
[1:19:46] cannot coexist what happens love demands
[1:19:50] fear to
[1:19:52] leave love demands
[1:19:55] fear to leave its
[1:19:58] presence go and you know what love
[1:20:01] perfect love is the only thing that can
[1:20:04] cast it
[1:20:05] out now I'm not saying you can't come be
[1:20:09] prayed for and in the name of Jesus cast
[1:20:11] out a spirit for that is not what I said
[1:20:15] what I am
[1:20:17] saying is that if you want victory over
[1:20:20] fear then you must you must cast it out
[1:20:24] out of your life with perfect love
[1:20:27] because otherwise you cast out a spirit
[1:20:29] of fear it can come
[1:20:31] back but you get filled with the Divine
[1:20:33] love of God and I am telling you God is
[1:20:37] in your Tabernacle amen and fear is not
[1:20:41] allowed to be
[1:20:42] there I'm just saying God does not allow
[1:20:45] evil to be around his
[1:20:48] court what happened when Adam and Eve
[1:20:51] fell he he put
[1:20:53] cherubins there to protect them from
[1:20:56] getting to
[1:20:59] him well there's cherubin over him
[1:21:02] watching him there's
[1:21:05] archangels God does not want to pollute
[1:21:08] his throne with with fear with
[1:21:10] evil so I am telling
[1:21:13] you love God with everything that you
[1:21:16] have within you because God does not
[1:21:19] allow fear around
[1:21:20] him and I say around him it may be out
[1:21:24] there there but not in his court amen
[1:21:27] not in his
[1:21:29] court doesn't come in oh yeah let's just
[1:21:31] you know you know manipulate me no get
[1:21:34] out of here I know you what did the
[1:21:38] demon say to him have you come to
[1:21:39] torment us before our time because there
[1:21:42] is a it oil and water it don't mix
[1:21:45] either does perfect love and fear amen
[1:21:47] we don't want to say I got love and then
[1:21:49] you allow fear there don't do
[1:21:52] that love will not be in the love of God
[1:21:56] will not be
[1:21:58] intimidated it will not be tormented
[1:22:01] with hopeless
[1:22:02] thoughts it would not be used it would
[1:22:05] not be taken advantage of it would not
[1:22:06] be manipulated by fear love the love of
[1:22:11] God will not be brought under control by
[1:22:17] fear you know what it doesn't even have
[1:22:19] time to spend with
[1:22:21] it it doesn't even got time to listen
[1:22:25] it can't coexist if it comes knocking at
[1:22:28] the door Perfect love just says get off
[1:22:32] my property amen get off my property it
[1:22:36] isn't a wish
[1:22:39] list
[1:22:41] look you could have 10 people around you
[1:22:44] all worried worked up full of anxiety
[1:22:47] right inside of you perfect
[1:22:51] peace perfect loveen
[1:22:57] it shall not come nigh thy dwelling am
[1:23:01] perfect
[1:23:02] love patrols these
[1:23:05] grounds it's like you know like the
[1:23:07] police they they Patrol right make sure
[1:23:09] things are in order stay in order well
[1:23:12] the Holy Ghost patrols these grounds no
[1:23:14] fear is allowed it makes sure that it is
[1:23:18] not allowed to stay remember you're the
[1:23:21] Temple of the Holy Ghost
[1:23:25] so if you're serious about overcoming
[1:23:27] fears I say this first seek the love of
[1:23:30] God brother Bram
[1:23:33] said when he went there cross the
[1:23:36] curtain of time he said this nothing but
[1:23:40] perfect love can enter in Amen in other
[1:23:43] words when he was there and they were
[1:23:44] coming up and my precious brother my my
[1:23:47] and all this was happening and he
[1:23:49] couldn't describe what is this I've
[1:23:51] never seen this before in human love
[1:23:55] he was not being bombarded with thoughts
[1:23:57] of you know what you forgot to do that
[1:24:01] one thing that you should have
[1:24:03] done he wasn't tormented with
[1:24:07] fear because he was in this place of
[1:24:10] God's presence called perfect love and
[1:24:13] everybody that came the a everyone
[1:24:15] testifying to him perfect
[1:24:19] love no fear was
[1:24:22] there well that's up in heaven but what
[1:24:24] about down here are you going to be a
[1:24:26] believer that you can have eternal life
[1:24:27] in you or do you think you got to wait
[1:24:29] to get there to get
[1:24:31] it that's why the prophet said whatever
[1:24:33] you do get perfect love in other words
[1:24:35] get serious about having this in you if
[1:24:38] you can't believe that you can be
[1:24:41] changed what are we doing sitting here
[1:24:44] what are we doing listening to this
[1:24:50] tape God cast out
[1:24:53] fear with his own
[1:24:57] presence Satan is not allowed to be
[1:25:00] there turn with me if you would to
[1:25:02] Psalms 91 we have to try to hurry
[1:25:05] because what you know why you've been
[1:25:08] here before because there's still more
[1:25:10] to come Psalms 91:1 says he that
[1:25:14] dwelleth in the secret place of the most
[1:25:17] high shall abide under the shadow of the
[1:25:21] almighty so there is a place with God
[1:25:24] yes that it he he calls it
[1:25:31] secret in other
[1:25:34] words nobody knows about it except you
[1:25:39] and
[1:25:41] him I want you to think about that we
[1:25:43] can be in church we can have a
[1:25:44] Hallelujah meeting we can dance we can
[1:25:47] all sorts of things can
[1:25:50] happen but that is not what this is
[1:25:53] talking about
[1:25:55] we're talking about
[1:25:57] dwelling dwelling I'm telling you you go
[1:26:00] up to a
[1:26:01] stoplight and you got to wait for that
[1:26:03] thing to turn green that your engine is
[1:26:06] it it's idling is dwelling there it's
[1:26:10] stopped when you go home tonight you're
[1:26:13] going home to your house where you
[1:26:17] dwell you're not going to dwell
[1:26:19] somewhere else tomorrow you're not
[1:26:21] looking for another house the next week
[1:26:24] it's your Dwelling Place if I went to
[1:26:26] your house you could tell me where you
[1:26:28] keep your
[1:26:29] slippers you know you know the
[1:26:32] secret you know the secrets in your
[1:26:35] house the secret
[1:26:38] places you you could tell me where the
[1:26:40] licorish is
[1:26:41] at where the chocolate is
[1:26:45] at there's a place in Christ that is
[1:26:48] just you and
[1:26:50] him and if you want to know more of the
[1:26:52] secrets you're going to have to get
[1:26:53] alone with him in prayer and spend a lot
[1:26:56] of time
[1:26:58] there because we don't serve a God
[1:27:00] that's some Santa Claus granny that just
[1:27:02] all you have to do is spend a couple
[1:27:03] minutes and it'll meet all your needs
[1:27:04] that is not the God we serve we serve a
[1:27:07] god of
[1:27:09] commitment I will say of the Lord I am
[1:27:13] gonna say this is going to be my
[1:27:14] testimony I'm gonna come to church and
[1:27:16] I'm gonna say he is my refuge my
[1:27:20] Fortress my God in him I will choose to
[1:27:24] trust surely he shall deliver me surely
[1:27:27] there is no question about this I do not
[1:27:30] fear surely he will
[1:27:33] deliver now let's count the odds it's
[1:27:35] way out the good the bad the pros the
[1:27:37] cons let's just think this thing through
[1:27:39] no surely he shall deliver thee he shall
[1:27:43] cover thee with his feathers and under
[1:27:44] his wings shall thou
[1:27:47] trust that's a good place to
[1:27:49] [Music]
[1:27:51] trust something about being In the Arms
[1:27:55] of
[1:27:56] Jesus his truth shall be thy
[1:27:59] Shield his
[1:28:01] truth his
[1:28:04] word this
[1:28:07] message it's our
[1:28:10] Shield
[1:28:11] not whatever you want that's not your
[1:28:15] Shield your Shield is his
[1:28:18] word and
[1:28:20] buckler Thou shalt not be afraid verse
[1:28:23] five for the Terror by
[1:28:25] night or nor the arrow that fth by day
[1:28:30] through the course of the day the devil
[1:28:31] can come with so many thoughts at us
[1:28:34] zoom zoom zoom zoom zoom
[1:28:36] zoom I'm not going to be afraid by the
[1:28:39] terror there's no fear that's going to
[1:28:41] come into here he's allowed to do this
[1:28:45] yes but he is not allowed inside because
[1:28:48] I have taken a stand
[1:28:51] amen I think God is calling us to stand
[1:28:55] up a thousand demons verse 7even shall
[1:28:59] fall at thy side and 10,000 demons at
[1:29:04] thy right hand but it shall not come
[1:29:07] nigh thee why because you're in the
[1:29:09] secret Dwelling Place With God you're in
[1:29:11] this place called perfect
[1:29:13] love
[1:29:15] amen verse n so real because thou has
[1:29:21] made the Lord which is my ref Refuge
[1:29:25] even the most high thy habitation I
[1:29:28] choose to dwell in perfect
[1:29:31] love not dwelling in church not reading
[1:29:34] your Bible for an hour every
[1:29:37] day it's about dwelling in the perfect
[1:29:40] love of
[1:29:41] God you choose to dwell and live in the
[1:29:44] presence of God's Divine love in other
[1:29:47] words when somebody slaps you on the
[1:29:48] face it is no problem to turn the
[1:29:50] cheek when you're being used and abused
[1:29:55] asked to go the Second
[1:29:57] Mile you know Perfect love just steps in
[1:29:59] and says I've already been asked to be
[1:30:02] like my my
[1:30:06] husband is that what Jesus said be ye
[1:30:08] perfect even as my Father in Heaven is
[1:30:10] perfect amen because he have set his
[1:30:13] love upon me therefore will I deliver
[1:30:16] him set your love somewhere else see if
[1:30:20] God delivers you you know so many people
[1:30:22] walk away around so in this world
[1:30:24] natural
[1:30:26] carnal wanting help with this that and
[1:30:28] the other and they don't even care about
[1:30:32] setting their love on God it's like it's
[1:30:35] not in their equation they can read it
[1:30:38] they can hear it being
[1:30:40] preached but it it just doesn't it
[1:30:43] doesn't connect and I'll just say
[1:30:47] this
[1:30:49] water and oil doesn't mix
[1:30:54] but if you're having a Trouble With Fear
[1:30:57] With Your Love I'm going to say take the
[1:30:59] love you got and just start setting it
[1:31:02] upon
[1:31:04] God because all of a sudden fear is
[1:31:07] going to go bye-bye you're going to have
[1:31:09] strength to say get behind me
[1:31:11] Satan there shall no evil verse 10 says
[1:31:15] Beall thee neither shall any plague come
[1:31:19] nigh thy dwelling
[1:31:26] amen God has not given us the spirit of
[1:31:30] fear
[1:31:32] amen but of power love and of a sound
[1:31:36] mind I do not have to accept what the
[1:31:39] devil's bringing to me that's what he
[1:31:41] was trying to tell Timothy in that
[1:31:43] scripture turn with me if you would to
[1:31:45] First 1 John chapter 4 opening scripture
[1:31:48] we're going to try to get through this
[1:31:49] really really quickly because time is is
[1:31:53] is getting close I I don't want you to
[1:31:55] think you know it's here yet I want you
[1:31:58] to relax and think it's like just a few
[1:32:00] minutes after we
[1:32:02] started 1 John chapter 4 verse number
[1:32:06] 16
[1:32:07] [Music]
[1:32:10] says and we have known and believe that
[1:32:15] the love that God has to
[1:32:18] us God is
[1:32:21] love and he that dwelleth in that secret
[1:32:24] place called love is actually dwelling
[1:32:28] in
[1:32:29] God and and if we choose to dwell there
[1:32:32] that means God is in
[1:32:35] US herein is our love made perfect that
[1:32:39] we may have a boldness in the day of
[1:32:41] judgment can you imagine being as bold
[1:32:44] as on the day of judgment now we we
[1:32:45] think of judgment being a place
[1:32:49] of God have mercy on me
[1:32:54] oh
[1:32:55] no and
[1:32:58] here John is trying to tell us that we
[1:33:02] can actually have
[1:33:04] boldness on that
[1:33:06] day in fact if we understand the
[1:33:11] scriptures we take our judgment here we
[1:33:14] have our white Throne judgment here
[1:33:17] because we all stand before the white
[1:33:18] Throne right we all stand before but
[1:33:20] ours is here we just do it willingly
[1:33:24] there it's
[1:33:27] unwillingly and we're literally sitting
[1:33:29] next to God on the on that
[1:33:31] Throne is that right we're going to
[1:33:35] judge Angels it it just so we can have
[1:33:38] this boldness here is our love made
[1:33:39] perfect that we may have boldness in the
[1:33:41] day of judgment because as he is we
[1:33:44] decided to be the same way in this
[1:33:47] world I'm going to love just like God
[1:33:50] loves amen I'm going to give like God
[1:33:52] gives I'm going to live for others just
[1:33:54] the way that God did I'm going to let
[1:33:56] him come
[1:33:58] inside there is no fear in love but
[1:34:02] perfect love it just cast out fear
[1:34:04] because fear has torment he that fearth
[1:34:06] is not made perfect in love we love him
[1:34:10] because he first loved us amen so you
[1:34:13] know what I I believe I can love God
[1:34:16] back with the same love that he loves me
[1:34:18] with If any man is going to go off what
[1:34:21] I'm saying here he's got his own little
[1:34:23] thing going and and if any man just says
[1:34:25] I love God but he actually is really
[1:34:28] inside has a hate
[1:34:31] problem well the white Throne judgment
[1:34:34] says he's a
[1:34:35] liar for he that loveth not his brother
[1:34:38] who he has seen how can he love God who
[1:34:41] is not seen and this commandment we have
[1:34:45] from him that he who loveth God loveth
[1:34:49] his brother also yes makes it clear
[1:34:53] doesn't one more scripture and this is
[1:34:54] in Romans chapter 8 and really um that
[1:34:59] was at the at the end when I was in back
[1:35:01] here studying I got to thinking about
[1:35:03] this here at the end of Romans chapter 8
[1:35:06] talking about nothing can separate us
[1:35:09] from the love of
[1:35:10] God and and and
[1:35:14] basically Paul is trying to give the
[1:35:17] Romans a a
[1:35:19] confidence that that if he says if God
[1:35:22] be for us who can be against
[1:35:24] us what what shall we say to these
[1:35:27] things who shall lay anything to the
[1:35:29] charge of of God's elect what can be
[1:35:32] placed upon the elect of God to make
[1:35:36] them
[1:35:39] fear
[1:35:40] nothing nothing think about that there
[1:35:43] is no sin there is
[1:35:49] nothing if God before you now if you're
[1:35:52] not
[1:35:54] let me just say this if you're not under
[1:35:56] the
[1:36:00] blood fear can have its way in your
[1:36:04] life
[1:36:06] yes
[1:36:10] yes if you're in the love of God God
[1:36:13] will not allow anything to come against
[1:36:18] you because that's what Calvary was all
[1:36:22] about he doesn't look at us as as having
[1:36:26] to be perfect he's looking at us to be
[1:36:29] in him Amen in the love of God so he
[1:36:33] says in verse 30 who is he that
[1:36:35] condemneth and in verse 35 who shall
[1:36:38] separate us from the love of Christ
[1:36:40] who's going to separate us from this
[1:36:42] dwelling place is it going to be
[1:36:44] tribulation a distress persecution
[1:36:45] famine nakedness Peril
[1:36:47] sword are you fearing any of these of
[1:36:50] course maybe in our time you know our
[1:36:53] electronic
[1:36:54] you know we got other things we can put
[1:36:56] in there are are we going to is anything
[1:36:59] going to separate us
[1:37:01] absolutely not
[1:37:04] amen as it is written for thy sake we
[1:37:06] are killed all the day long we are
[1:37:07] counted as sheep for the slaughter nay
[1:37:10] in all these
[1:37:12] things we're more than a
[1:37:14] conqueror we're
[1:37:17] more we're more we didn't
[1:37:20] conquer he already conquered yes amen
[1:37:24] we're just dwelling in his love we're
[1:37:27] more than a
[1:37:29] conqueror we're more than a conquer
[1:37:32] through him that loved us not in our own
[1:37:36] abilities for I am persuaded that
[1:37:38] neither death nor life nor angels
[1:37:40] principalities
[1:37:41] Powers I love this can you read this
[1:37:44] part with me nor things
[1:37:49] present things present in our life nor
[1:37:53] things that are even to come I'm not
[1:37:55] going to fear things going to come I'm
[1:37:57] not going to fear the things that are
[1:37:58] present nor height nor death nor any
[1:38:00] other creature shall be able to separate
[1:38:03] me from the dwelling place of God the
[1:38:05] love of God which is in Christ Jesus our
[1:38:08] lord let's Stand Together God bless
[1:38:11] you amen nothing
[1:38:15] nothing real simple just believe what
[1:38:17] the word
[1:38:18] says believe it
[1:38:29] you ever been at at in your home and you
[1:38:32] heard
[1:38:34] some some scratching I mean we were one
[1:38:37] time we were in
[1:38:39] Ohio at Airbnb or something like that
[1:38:43] and so we weren't real familiar with the
[1:38:45] place and all a sudden we heard
[1:38:50] this what's that I I don't know how many
[1:38:53] times you better go outside and check
[1:38:56] what's going
[1:39:03] on but when you go out and you see that
[1:39:06] oh that was just the thing rocking back
[1:39:09] and
[1:39:12] forth it was uncovered that it wasn't
[1:39:15] what you what the devil made it
[1:39:18] sound this word is to uncover the devil
[1:39:22] in our personal life so that he canot
[1:39:24] have a hold on
[1:39:28] us and so we can stay connected to the
[1:39:30] Lord amen let's sing I've Anchored In
