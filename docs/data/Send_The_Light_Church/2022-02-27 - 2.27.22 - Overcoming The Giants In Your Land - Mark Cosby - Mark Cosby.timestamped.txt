[0:21] natures lord change from the inside out

[0:25] the way lord sermon the imminent lord
[0:28] lord speak to your your children this is
[0:31] coming here wanting to let them only not
[0:32] hear it lord love you just do the word
[0:34] that you'll speak to the lord amen
[0:36] father we just want our hearts just to
[0:37] be so we can soften him we may receive
[0:39] all you have for us
[0:42] and lord we just want to title this
[0:43] little sermon is overcoming the giants
[0:45] in your land
[0:46] and the subject letting off the pressure
[0:53] when you get there say amen and we'll
[0:55] begin romans 8 35.
[1:05] amen
[1:07] so it says who shall separate us from
[1:09] the love of christ shall tribulation
[1:12] or distress or persecution or famine or
[1:16] nakedness or
[1:17] prayer or sword as is written for thy
[1:20] sake we are killed all the day long we
[1:23] are counted as sheep for the slaughter
[1:25] nay in all these things we are more than
[1:27] conquerors through him that loved us
[1:29] from persuaded that neither
[1:32] death nor life nor angels nor
[1:35] principalities nor powers nor things
[1:38] present nor things to come nor height
[1:41] nor depth nor any other creature shall
[1:43] be able to separate us from the love of
[1:45] christ which is in christ
[1:47] our lord christ jesus our lord
[1:49] so all these things
[1:52] sometimes can get into our life and
[1:54] tribulation and persecution and famine
[1:56] get in our life and kind of just bring
[1:58] us down but what the scripture's telling
[2:00] me here none of these things should move
[2:02] us we should be standing on what god has
[2:04] been speaking to us standing on his word
[2:06] because right here this is a promise
[2:08] right here because
[2:09] he died for you so you can become an
[2:11] overcomer not so you can just you know
[2:14] just stay in this little bubble and be
[2:15] scared of things but god is calling you
[2:18] to look at these things in his word and
[2:20] saying
[2:20] nade all these things we're more than
[2:22] conquerors through him that loved us
[2:24] so let's go to let's go to revelations
[2:26] chapter 3 verse 20.
[2:31] so it says
[2:32] behold i stand at the door and knock so
[2:35] this morning he's knocking at your heart
[2:37] he's wanting to to come in and sup with
[2:40] you to commune with you but the thing is
[2:42] you have to open that door he's not
[2:43] going to kick the door down he wants you
[2:45] to open that door he's a gentleman
[2:47] behold i stand at the door
[2:49] and knock
[2:51] if any man hear my voice and open the
[2:53] door i will come into him and will sup
[2:56] with him and he with me verse 21 to him
[2:59] that overcometh while i grant to sit
[3:01] with me in my throne even as i also
[3:04] overcame and have sat down with my
[3:06] father in his throne
[3:08] so jesus has overcome
[3:10] hath
[3:10] hell death in the grave
[3:12] and he's calling you to be an overcomer
[3:14] as well
[3:16] he says well i love this in 22. he that
[3:18] hath an ear let him hear what the spirit
[3:20] saying to the churches always i like to
[3:22] pray lord give us ears to hear give us
[3:24] eyes to see
[3:26] so uh so we're living in a day of
[3:28] pressure there's pressure all around us
[3:29] you have coveted
[3:31] politics around the world or just crazy
[3:33] people there's 54 different genders you
[3:35] can be all these crazy things that are
[3:37] happening there's pressures
[3:40] how can god using your kingdom if you're
[3:41] letting the pressures of this life
[3:43] capsize your ship there's financial
[3:45] issues
[3:46] all these things you fill in the blank
[3:48] of that that are going on in people's
[3:49] lives and the thing is who are you
[3:52] giving control of the steering wheel in
[3:54] your life are you trying to take control
[3:56] or is god you letting god take control
[3:58] of it
[3:59] and what is pressure i looked at what
[4:00] pressure is
[4:01] is the act of squeezing or crushing the
[4:04] state of being squeezed and crushed now
[4:07] satan he wants to
[4:09] just crush you and squeeze you with all
[4:11] these problems in his world he wants to
[4:12] make you think about this and that he
[4:14] wants you to worry he wants to do all
[4:16] these things just to distract you from
[4:18] god
[4:19] so
[4:20] so also also another definition that
[4:22] which afflicts the body or depresses the
[4:24] spirit he wants to depress your spirit
[4:25] he wants to put a spirit of oppression a
[4:28] spirit of depression into you
[4:30] because you look at a lot of communities
[4:31] there's a lot of oppression they're so
[4:33] used to living in that state that they
[4:35] think there's no way out and satan has
[4:37] got them thinking that
[4:40] so also it's any severe affliction
[4:42] distress calamity or grievance
[4:44] straits difficulties embarrassments or
[4:47] distress uh the occasion even like satan
[4:49] likes to make you feel embarrassed if
[4:51] you have something in your life a vice
[4:53] or a addiction he wants to feel
[4:54] embarrassed about he thinks that you he
[4:56] wants to make you think you can never
[4:57] overcome it but the thing is i'll tell
[4:59] you my brother and sister you can
[5:00] overcome
[5:01] he's called you to overcome everything
[5:04] so
[5:05] we speak of pressure of poverty or want
[5:07] the pressures of debts the pressure of
[5:09] taxes the pressure of affliction or
[5:10] sorrow
[5:12] read a little quote real quick that fits
[5:13] with this and we're living in a day of
[5:15] much pressure
[5:16] everywhere everybody is so tense and
[5:19] down the street with a hot rod they
[5:21] can't wait for the stoplight and you
[5:22] know and run you over
[5:24] they're not going anywhere not at all
[5:26] they're just as hard as they can race
[5:27] but just racing towards eternity is all
[5:29] i know
[5:30] and they have uh
[5:32] you have to watch this way get the watch
[5:34] that way
[5:35] and i said there's just two classes of
[5:36] people who live down here that's the
[5:38] quick and the dead
[5:40] and them that ain't quick die quick
[5:42] i might it's dangerous to be safe this
[5:44] day hurrying and racing everybody's in a
[5:46] hurry to get everywhere
[5:47] everybody is so you look the highway
[5:50] people are going 89 miles an hour and if
[5:52] you're not going that fast they're gonna
[5:53] try to run you over and and then you go
[5:56] over and they give you they yell at you
[5:58] so it's just a day we're living and
[6:00] everybody's just has so much pressure
[6:02] and so much built up and they don't know
[6:04] where to go and they got to realize
[6:06] there's a refuge they can go to is jesus
[6:08] christ
[6:10] so
[6:11] in this day there's so much pressure and
[6:13] the problem is we're trying to go a
[6:15] million miles an hour that's the problem
[6:16] right there we're trying to go faster
[6:18] than when god's moving
[6:21] so
[6:23] we're trying to do this and get into
[6:24] this and then we go here and then we go
[6:26] there the problem is we don't get steal
[6:27] before god that's the problem we have a
[6:30] little prayer say oh lord you know bless
[6:31] this time i thank you lord jesus and
[6:33] we're going with our day it's not just
[6:35] about checking the box
[6:38] not about checking the box what it's
[6:39] about
[6:40] just
[6:41] getting still with the lord and say lord
[6:42] i'm here to meet with you i want to get
[6:44] to know you in a special way
[6:46] and
[6:49] the thing is we have to not just read
[6:50] the word but live that word we're
[6:52] reading
[6:53] the spirit jesus has to bring his spirit
[6:55] and bring that word to life before you
[6:58] and that's the key right that we have to
[6:59] do on a daily basis and not just about
[7:01] reading it's like it's some encyclopedia
[7:02] or some some book of knowledge because
[7:04] now it's puff it's up
[7:06] right so you guys can be seated i'm
[7:08] sorry let you guys be seated
[7:10] forgive me guys so the problem is we
[7:12] make ourselves too busy for god we want
[7:15] to do we want to do we want to do the
[7:17] problem is we want to fit god into our
[7:18] schedule
[7:19] and the thing is he doesn't want to fit
[7:21] into our schedule he wants to be the
[7:22] center of your life
[7:25] and not just one day a week not just two
[7:27] days a week not just three days but
[7:28] seven days a week don't just wait to
[7:30] meet him at church
[7:31] but meet him every day in your homes in
[7:33] your cars at your job bring him with you
[7:35] everywhere you go that's what he wants
[7:37] to be
[7:38] anything don't just pencil him in every
[7:40] once in a while but make him a
[7:42] first thing i do in the morning get out
[7:44] of my bed and i get right in my knees
[7:46] because i know my evil wicked flesh
[7:48] doesn't want to serve them and if it
[7:50] does want to serve it wants to serve
[7:51] them in the the bare minimalist you know
[7:54] so
[7:55] the thing is the when the enemy what's
[7:57] the enemy's job is to overwhelm you to
[7:59] get you distracted off your off your
[8:01] path then once your enemy wants to get
[8:03] you distracted from the lord he wants
[8:05] you to take a substitute that's what he
[8:07] wants to do he wants us to have a
[8:08] religion was a covering
[8:10] and a lot of people he's fooled with
[8:12] that you know they just have a covering
[8:14] they don't have a
[8:15] the real
[8:16] life they that christ wants them to have
[8:18] they have a covering so let's go to luke
[8:21] 21 34.
[8:26] read over there
[8:29] so luke 21 34.
[8:32] so
[8:34] and take heed to yourselves let's say
[8:36] any times your hearts be
[8:38] overcharged with surfetting and
[8:41] drunkenness and the cares of this life
[8:44] and so the day
[8:45] so the day come upon you unawares for as
[8:48] a snare shall come on all them that
[8:50] dwell on the face of the whole earth
[8:53] watch ye therefore and pray always you
[8:55] know it says pray always doesn't say
[8:57] pray sometimes we pray fifty percent of
[8:59] time but pray always even paul said pray
[9:01] without ceasing
[9:04] uh that you may be accounted worthy to
[9:06] escape all things that shall come to
[9:08] pass and to stand before the son of man
[9:11] so i looked the word up surf editing i
[9:13] just was curious what it meant so it's
[9:14] the act of feeding to excess gluttony so
[9:17] you can be feeding on fear be feeding on
[9:20] too much politics just be feeding on
[9:23] too many woes in your life the thing is
[9:25] we're not here to look at the problems
[9:27] in our life but the god inside of you
[9:29] can handle all the problems that you're
[9:31] facing
[9:32] so so i like the word overcharged or
[9:35] because you know overcharge like if you
[9:36] overcharge a circuit the fuse is going
[9:38] to blow so if you're overcharged with
[9:40] fear and worry then you're going to blow
[9:43] because you're because you're not going
[9:44] to the right source you're not going to
[9:46] the refuge to the tower
[9:48] so
[9:49] so let's let's not get ourselves
[9:50] overcharged with pressure of this life
[9:52] anymore let us take a stand and say lord
[9:54] i'm not letting i'm not looking at the
[9:56] problems in my life but i'm looking to
[9:58] you who can help me through these
[10:00] problems in my life
[10:01] and the thing is and the reason why the
[10:03] world's in its condition it is today
[10:04] they're looking for relief they're
[10:06] looking for a cure
[10:08] all this stress and destruction in their
[10:09] life all this pressure suicide rates are
[10:11] going up depression is going up going to
[10:14] psychiatrists is more and all these
[10:16] other things
[10:17] and the thing is they're turning to the
[10:18] wrong things they're turning alcohol
[10:20] they're turning cigarettes they're
[10:22] turning pornography other drugs they're
[10:24] trying to make more money
[10:26] they're trying to fulfill that void with
[10:27] with men are trying to fill the void
[10:28] with more women and women with more men
[10:31] see they're trying to think that this
[10:33] temporal satisfaction is going to make
[10:34] them whole but what it is is just like
[10:36] putting a band-aid over your heart or
[10:38] you know you're getting shot and put
[10:40] abandoned over a gun wound a fatal gun
[10:42] was not going to help and the thing is
[10:44] we're not here to find something
[10:45] temporary we're here to find something
[10:47] that will have rest unto our souls
[10:49] people are looking for rest into their
[10:50] souls but they're looking to the wrong
[10:52] things
[10:53] until you meet and have a personal
[10:55] experience with jesus christ you will
[10:57] never be whole or complete you never
[10:59] will just because there's no substitute
[11:02] that's what satan's trying to get them
[11:03] to get is a substitute
[11:05] and the thing is they don't realize like
[11:07] i said before they're putting a patch on
[11:08] their heart just like when a kid was
[11:10] told to clean his room you know you put
[11:11] underneath the bed put in your closet
[11:13] and the thing is your room is still
[11:15] dirty but you just you know you're just
[11:16] putting it in a little spot and hiding
[11:18] it away so and the thing is you're going
[11:20] to have to clean the room eventually
[11:22] so
[11:23] let's go to psalm 62 8. we just want to
[11:26] just really point to the lord he's a
[11:28] refuge he's a tower he's a fortress
[11:35] praise the lord
[11:39] 62 verse 8 so it says trust in him
[11:42] at all times notice that trust in him at
[11:45] all times
[11:47] ye people pour out your heart before him
[11:49] god is a refuge for us sila i'll read
[11:52] that one more time
[11:54] trust in him at all times ye people
[11:57] pour out your heart before him
[11:59] we gotta think like this when jesus
[12:01] christ is on this earth he was tempted
[12:02] beyond all measure he knows he went
[12:04] through sickness he went through sadness
[12:07] he went through loss of somebody loss of
[12:09] a close friend
[12:10] so he knows exactly what you're feeling
[12:13] and he can relate to you he's a high
[12:14] priest that can be touched by the
[12:16] feeling of our infirmities so don't ever
[12:19] think that god doesn't know what you're
[12:20] feeling because he was once in flesh
[12:22] it's like you and i
[12:24] and he he overcame everything
[12:26] for you
[12:28] so let's go to we'll go to psalms 119.
[12:34] psalms 119 verse 114.
[12:39] and that one says
[12:40] thou are my hiding place and my shield
[12:42] so he's your hiding place
[12:44] don't just wait until the time of
[12:46] trouble to go hide away with him but do
[12:48] it in the good times a lot of times as
[12:50] human beings
[12:51] you know we kind of put god off to the
[12:53] side when times are prospered times are
[12:55] good and then when times of you know
[12:58] trials and tribulations come we it takes
[13:00] us by surprise because we haven't been
[13:02] spending that in the spirit time with
[13:04] him
[13:04] and your walk is a daily walk like i
[13:06] said before it's not a you know just
[13:08] when times are bad walk but it's a it's
[13:10] a daily walk i remember this quote that
[13:12] a minister said
[13:14] he said his prayer your steering wheel
[13:16] or your spare tire
[13:18] you know because prayer should be
[13:20] leading your life it should be a
[13:20] steering wheel of your life
[13:22] a lot of people just wait you know use
[13:23] that spare tire for prayer you know when
[13:25] they need it but that's not how a walk
[13:27] is that's not a personal relationship
[13:30] so
[13:31] let's go back we'll go spend a little
[13:32] time in the book of psalms kyle i just
[13:34] love how david just really points to god
[13:36] being a refuge to being a tower a mighty
[13:38] fortress so go to 40 psalms 46
[13:42] it's a few
[13:43] pages back
[13:45] and we'll read verses 1 through 7.
[13:49] so it says right right off the bat he
[13:50] says god is our refuge
[13:52] and strength
[13:54] is a very present help in trouble
[13:56] so he's your refuge
[13:58] he's your strength
[14:00] a very present of help and trouble
[14:03] therefore will we not fear
[14:05] though the earth be removed though the
[14:07] trials may come
[14:08] or the devil tries to capsize your ship
[14:11] says don't fear
[14:13] and though the mountains be carried into
[14:15] the midst of the sea though the waters
[14:17] therefore roar and be troubled though
[14:19] the mountains shake with swelling
[14:21] thereof sila
[14:23] though there was one more time though
[14:25] the waters therefore roar and be
[14:26] troubled though your family forsakes you
[14:29] though your friends forsake you
[14:32] don't let this may you don't let that
[14:33] take you off your course
[14:35] the walk is between you and jesus not
[14:37] between you your friend and jesus not
[14:39] you and your wife and jesus but it's a
[14:40] straight narrow for only you and
[14:42] him there is a river the stream's
[14:45] warfare shall make glad the city of god
[14:47] the holy place of the tabernacles of the
[14:50] most high
[14:51] god is in the midst of her she shall not
[14:53] be moved god shall help her
[14:56] and that right and early the heathen
[14:58] rage the kings were moved he uttered his
[15:00] voice and the earth melted politics are
[15:02] going crazy democrats republicans i
[15:05] don't care who they are they're all
[15:06] going crazy this world is going crazy
[15:08] it's insane it's insanity
[15:12] the lord is the lord of hosts is with us
[15:14] remember that the lord is host is with
[15:16] us he's with each one of you he's not a
[15:18] respecter of persons
[15:20] the god of jacob is our refuge selah
[15:24] remember he's your refuge
[15:26] so let's go to psalms 91.
[15:32] praise god
[15:34] so we'll read uh verses 1 through 6 and
[15:37] then we'll jump to 14-16
[15:39] he that dwelleth in the secret place of
[15:41] the most high
[15:42] shall abide under the shadow of almighty
[15:45] i pray that you're dwelling in the
[15:46] secret place of the most high
[15:49] i will say of the lord he is my what my
[15:52] refuge
[15:53] my fortress
[15:55] my god in him will i trust it doesn't
[15:58] say i'm i'm going to trust in the world
[16:00] i'm going to trust in a b and c but i'm
[16:02] going to trust in him
[16:04] surely he shall deliver thee from the
[16:06] snare of the fowler and from the
[16:08] nonsense of the pestilence he shall
[16:11] cover thee with his feathers
[16:13] under his wings thou shalt trust him
[16:16] his truth shall be thy shield
[16:18] and buckler
[16:20] thou shall not be afraid for the terror
[16:22] by night
[16:23] nor for the arrow that flies by day
[16:25] nor for the pestilence that walketh in
[16:27] darkness nor for the destruction that
[16:30] wastes at that noon day verse 14 we're
[16:32] going to jump to
[16:33] because he had set his love upon me
[16:35] therefore i deliver him i will set him
[16:38] on high because he has known my name
[16:40] he's speaking to you because he has set
[16:41] his love upon me therefore i deliver him
[16:44] if you're looking for deliverance
[16:45] tonight set your love upon him so the
[16:47] scripture's telling us right there
[16:49] because he knoweth my name he shall call
[16:51] upon me and i will answer i will be with
[16:54] him in trouble i will deliver him and
[16:56] honor him that's a promise right there
[16:57] to each one of you he's going to do that
[16:59] with long life
[17:01] will i satisfy him and shoot him my
[17:03] salvation
[17:05] so the problem is in this world people
[17:07] are putting their faith in the wrong
[17:08] things
[17:10] they're building they're building a
[17:11] house on sinking sands
[17:13] and jesus told us in matthew 7 24
[17:17] about to too end of it too
[17:19] a parable about building your house on a
[17:20] rock or a sand we're going to get into
[17:22] it a little bit right now actually
[17:24] so go to matthew 7 24
[17:26] and read those three verses
[17:30] praise god
[17:33] so matthew 7
[17:36] 24 it says
[17:38] therefore it says whosoever
[17:40] heareth thee sayings of mine and do with
[17:43] them i will liken unto
[17:45] a wise man which built his house upon a
[17:47] rock
[17:48] and the rain descended and the floods
[17:50] came and the winds blew so the trials
[17:51] came
[17:52] uh his family maybe forsaked him his
[17:55] friends maybe talked behind his back
[17:58] but it says and it beat upon that house
[18:00] and it fell not for it was founded upon
[18:03] a rock so your walk must be founded upon
[18:05] faith
[18:06] faith is your foundation
[18:08] if you don't have faith in your walk
[18:10] then you have no walk it's gonna fall
[18:12] every time
[18:14] everyone that heareth these sayings of
[18:16] mine and do with them not shall be
[18:17] likened until a foolish man which built
[18:19] his house upon the sand and the rain
[18:22] descended and the floods came and the
[18:23] winds blew
[18:25] the house may have stood for a little
[18:26] time
[18:27] but when the trial the enemy started
[18:29] coming and beat upon that house and it
[18:31] fell and great was the fall of it
[18:35] so i prayed tonight this morning that
[18:37] your that your walk is built upon a rock
[18:41] and once again like i said before
[18:42] they're looking for a substitute it will
[18:44] never get the job done
[18:46] they don't even realize that they don't
[18:47] even have the the revelation of the true
[18:49] revelation of john 3 16 through 21
[18:52] because if they did it's not just i give
[18:54] my heart to you lord and i can do
[18:56] whatever i want
[18:57] but it's your life should prove john 3
[18:59] 16 through 21. and let's read that
[19:02] actually i just it's probably one of the
[19:03] most quoted scriptures
[19:05] and probably one of the most scriptures
[19:06] that is
[19:07] they don't know the revelation of it
[19:10] because the new revelation of it like i
[19:11] said they'll be living it so we'll start
[19:12] john 15
[19:14] that's whosoever
[19:16] in him sorry that whosoever believeth in
[19:18] him should not perish notice it says
[19:20] should not perish
[19:21] but have eternal life
[19:23] for god so loved the world that he gave
[19:25] his only begotten son that whosoever
[19:28] believeth in him should not perish but
[19:30] have everlasting life so he died for
[19:32] everyone in the world from adam on down
[19:35] to whoever is going to be born in the
[19:36] future he bore all their sins every
[19:39] every sin that you would commit he bore
[19:41] it for you because he loved you he knew
[19:44] the pain and agony it would take but he
[19:46] loved you so much he wanted to die for
[19:48] you
[19:49] to have a personal relationship with you
[19:52] he died for you that blood that was shed
[19:54] cleanses you of all sins
[19:56] and he did that so that the holy spirit
[19:58] could come back in and live in you so
[20:00] you can have an eternal fellowship with
[20:02] him
[20:03] so let's go to verse 17.
[20:04] for god sent sic god sent not his son
[20:08] into the world to condemn the world but
[20:10] the world through him might be saved
[20:12] look at that might be saved he knew he
[20:13] knew that everybody wasn't going to
[20:15] accept him
[20:16] in that full walk
[20:18] but he still reached out that hand and
[20:19] gave them opportunity
[20:21] to accept him
[20:23] that's true love that's what true love
[20:25] is
[20:26] people have a definition what love is
[20:27] but true love is
[20:29] john 3 16.
[20:31] and you'll only know what true love is
[20:33] when god comes into your life and just
[20:35] shows you that love and you experience
[20:36] that love that's when you got to know
[20:37] what true love is
[20:39] because you know human love has its
[20:40] limits
[20:41] it has its flaws but god's love agape
[20:44] love like paul spoke in first
[20:45] corinthians 13.
[20:48] it's perfect
[20:50] it's perfect love
[20:52] so verse uh
[20:53] sorry verse 18. yet again he that
[20:55] believeth on him is not condemned but he
[20:57] that believeth not is condemned already
[21:00] because he had not believed in the name
[21:02] of the only begotten son of god he's the
[21:04] way
[21:05] he's the life he's the truth
[21:08] you can't go any other way you can't
[21:12] so and this is condemnation that light
[21:14] is coming to the world and men love
[21:16] darkness rather than light so as our
[21:19] carnal nature we were born in darkness
[21:21] we love darkness we gravitated towards
[21:24] darkness that's what jesus said earlier
[21:25] in this chapter you must be born again
[21:28] your nature has to be changed you can't
[21:30] even see the kingdom of god until your
[21:32] nature has changed from the inside just
[21:34] like he spoke over and
[21:35] i believe ezekiel he wants to give you a
[21:37] new heart
[21:38] he wants to give you a new spirit a lot
[21:40] of people stop at that thinking that
[21:42] that's that's god's spirit inside him he
[21:44] says i want to give you a new heart a
[21:45] new spirit and then i'll put my spirit
[21:48] upon you and then you can do my
[21:49] commandments and my statues see his
[21:52] commandments aren't grievous but if
[21:54] you're not truly born again and filled
[21:55] with the holy spirit then they will be
[21:57] grievous because thing is it's not he
[21:59] wants to write the laws upon your heart
[22:01] he wants to in the old testament he they
[22:03] would circumcise was that was the type
[22:05] of the holy circumcised in the flesh but
[22:07] now he wants to circumcise your heart
[22:09] that's his desire and those laws and
[22:12] commandments and statutes you're going
[22:13] to do them naturally
[22:15] now but still you have to crucify your
[22:17] flesh daily
[22:18] you still have to do that just because
[22:20] you get the holy ghost doesn't mean
[22:21] everything's all hunky-dory you're
[22:23] stealing these carnal fleshly bodies
[22:25] either put it under subjection
[22:26] even in corinthians it talks about put
[22:28] every thought in the subject subjects of
[22:30] christ if you want the mind of christ
[22:32] this doesn't appear like some magic wand
[22:34] you have to fight for it you have to
[22:36] fight for that mind because satan's
[22:37] constantly trying to input
[22:39] thoughts in your mind ideas
[22:42] and you have to cast them out don't let
[22:44] them stay in there
[22:46] we'll finish this up for everyone that
[22:47] do with evil hateth the light neither
[22:49] cometh to the light lest his deeds
[22:51] should be reproved but he that doeth the
[22:53] truth cometh to the light that his deeds
[22:56] may be made manifest that are wrought
[22:58] in god
[23:00] so
[23:01] let me read a couple quotes uh there you
[23:04] are but we're going right on doing it
[23:05] why we're trying to find something to
[23:07] quiet quiet some anesthetic it seems
[23:10] like the world is in a break next speed
[23:12] i don't know what they mean but there's
[23:14] a christian anesthetic there is the
[23:16] opium that comes from a lily and the
[23:18] christian church has some opium and it's
[23:20] from the lily of the valley amen
[23:22] uh-huh sue's all the pains
[23:25] and it's all over then when you get this
[23:27] christian opium this new wine that they
[23:29] had in the day of pentecost that holy
[23:30] spirit it soothes the pain
[23:33] people so arrogant they're doing this
[23:35] and that they ought not to instead of
[23:37] trying to get rid of the cause
[23:38] they're just putting another cause with
[23:40] it it's like when you have a problem in
[23:41] your life and you have to solve it and
[23:43] the thing is when you we want to solve
[23:45] the problem you want to add more
[23:46] problems to it situation because you're
[23:48] just making the problem the situation
[23:49] works
[23:51] so instead of trying to get rid of the
[23:52] cause they're just putting another cause
[23:54] with it you can never find the cure and
[23:56] to get rid of the cause amen
[23:58] man is trying to find something to
[24:00] satisfy any thirst
[24:02] god see things people don't realize
[24:04] every human being this whole entire
[24:05] world god has put it a a thirst in them
[24:08] for god but it's up for them to choose
[24:10] whether they want to seek after god
[24:12] or things of the world
[24:14] everybody's thirsting for something and
[24:16] then we realize that god has placed that
[24:18] thirst inside of him but man is choosing
[24:20] to thirst after things of the world to
[24:22] try to satisfy that thirst inside of him
[24:24] and it's never ever going to get the job
[24:26] done
[24:27] see he was built that way but god built
[24:29] him that way so he thirst after him but
[24:31] he tries to satisfy and hush that holy
[24:34] call on him with things of the world and
[24:36] we have no right to do that
[24:38] now but people do wrong constantly
[24:40] instead of going to the place to get rid
[24:41] of the cause we try to hush it with
[24:43] anesthetics liquor and smoking and
[24:46] putting more to heaping up all the time
[24:48] making it worse and all this builds up
[24:50] the pressure it just makes it worse all
[24:52] the time
[24:55] so this world is just built upon
[24:56] pressure it's going to blow up one of
[24:58] these days the world built full of
[25:00] pressure and doctors don't know what to
[25:01] do about it the psychiatrist has got
[25:03] psychiatrists doctoring them that's
[25:05] right they don't have the answer but god
[25:07] does god has to answer all this people
[25:09] are thinking
[25:11] aau meetings are going to solve the
[25:12] problem you know and the thing is you
[25:14] got to put god
[25:16] in the forefront of that equation i'm
[25:18] not saying you can't go to counseling or
[25:19] this or that but if you think that the
[25:21] counseling is going to be your sole
[25:23] savior it's not you need more than that
[25:25] you got to have a personal experience
[25:26] with jesus christ
[25:28] and uh tonight this morning we'll just
[25:30] expose the enemy
[25:32] you know there's giants in our lives
[25:34] that we've been letting just stay in our
[25:36] lives
[25:37] of addiction
[25:39] fear
[25:40] complacency
[25:41] pride
[25:42] sickness pains grudges unbelief
[25:46] an up and down mind
[25:48] see the lord has not called you and i to
[25:50] coexist with the devil he hasn't
[25:53] the lord has not called us to coexist
[25:54] with those giants
[25:56] i think the problem is we just get too
[25:58] comfortable with with these vices
[26:00] addictions in our life and we kind of
[26:02] getting a thing of that we can't
[26:03] overcome it we may not say that
[26:05] outwardly but the thing is we just been
[26:07] living it we get used to living with it
[26:09] we're so used to it
[26:10] don't ever get used to living with the
[26:12] devil don't ever don't ever
[26:15] praise the lord that you've overcome
[26:16] things in your life i'm thankful for
[26:18] that but overcome these giants in your
[26:20] life right now
[26:21] because if that same god could deliver
[26:23] you from those things in the past he can
[26:24] deliver you from these things right now
[26:26] in your life
[26:29] so
[26:30] let's go to oh sorry let's go to romans

[27:07] and the thing is when you're trying to
[27:08] overcome something you can't just expect
[27:11] the lord just to wave some magic wand
[27:12] you you play a part in it you got to
[27:14] show the lord that you really want
[27:15] deliverance you have to step foot on it
[27:17] you have to step out and say lord i'm if
[27:19] i have to stop this right now cold
[27:21] turkey i'm going to do it i remember in
[27:22] my life when i had addiction

[27:26] and i literally just i remember one week
[27:28] it was like 2017 i just stopped it
[27:30] and i just every time i had a temptation
[27:32] or an urge i'll just pray to the lord
[27:35] every time

[28:11] amen amen praise god amen so we'll go to
[28:14] romans uh 13 and we'll reach out to
[28:17] verse 11.
[28:18] and that now knowing the time that now
[28:21] it's high time to awake
[28:23] out of sleep
[28:24] for now is our salvation nearer than we
[28:26] believed
[28:27] the night is far spent the day is at
[28:29] hand let us therefore what does it say
[28:31] cast off the works of darkness
[28:34] let us put on the armor of light
[28:36] let us walk honestly as in the day not
[28:38] in rioting and drunkenness
[28:40] not in chambering and wantedness not in
[28:42] strife and envy
[28:45] but put ye on the lord jesus christ
[28:47] and make not provision for the flesh
[28:50] to fulfill the lust thereof i'll read it
[28:52] one more time but put ye on the lord
[28:55] jesus christ and make not provision for
[28:58] the flesh to fulfill the lust thereof
[29:01] satan wants you to fulfill the lust of
[29:03] the flesh see the thing is sin
[29:05] feels good to the flesh it stimulates
[29:07] the flesh like wine
[29:09] and the thing is the more you can
[29:10] crucify your flesh daily
[29:13] hourly minutely secondly the more you
[29:15] can realize and see what god's perfect
[29:17] will is for your life
[29:20] let's go to revelations 3 20 again
[29:28] so it says
[29:33] behold i stand at the door and knock if
[29:36] any man hear my voice and open the door
[29:38] i will come into him and what's up with
[29:39] him
[29:40] and he with me
[29:41] to him that overcometh while i grant to
[29:43] sit with me in my throne it's calling us
[29:45] to overcome right here to him that
[29:47] overcometh will i grant to sit with me
[29:49] in my throne the thing is
[29:51] you have to be submissive and surrender
[29:53] to god
[29:54] and the overcomer inside he's going to
[29:56] overcome help you overcome that problem
[29:58] but you have to show him that you mean
[30:00] business that you're serious
[30:04] he had he they have an ear he that hath
[30:06] an ear let him hear what the spirit's
[30:08] saying to the churches and we turn to
[30:10] revelations 21 7.
[30:17] and we'll actually go verse 6
[30:19] and he said unto me it is done i am the
[30:22] alpha and omega the beginning and the
[30:25] end i will give unto him that is the
[30:27] thirst of the fountain of
[30:29] water of life freely i pray that you're
[30:32] thirsty this morning for that water of
[30:33] life
[30:34] he that overcometh shall inherit all
[30:36] things and i will be his god and he
[30:38] shall be my son
[30:39] noah says he that overcometh shall
[30:41] inherit all things so you're called to
[30:43] overcome the scriptures constantly
[30:45] telling us we're here to overcome
[30:47] satan is a defeated creature
[30:49] all his powers are stripped from him at
[30:50] calvary
[30:52] and he only has a he only has power if
[30:54] you give him power that's the thing
[30:56] if you let your vessel be willing to him
[30:58] and open him he's going to come in just
[31:00] like that parable jesus spoke of
[31:02] when that man was cast was cast all
[31:04] these demons out of him and his house
[31:06] was you know clean and garnished but he
[31:08] never got filled with the holy spirit
[31:11] and it was seven other worst spirits
[31:12] that came into him and his state was
[31:14] worse this time than it was from the
[31:16] last so my brother and sister let's get
[31:18] cleaned out
[31:20] clean these giants out your life
[31:22] you don't have to have a perverted mind
[31:24] you have to have a mind that's up and
[31:25] down you don't have to have fear
[31:28] doubts and all these things you can cast
[31:30] them out you can overcome these giants
[31:31] in your life like say we want to expose
[31:33] the enemy he hates to be exposed let's
[31:36] expose him
[31:37] he has no right to be in your life and
[31:38] to stay in your life
[31:40] so now i always love the story of david
[31:42] and goliath so when david met the giant
[31:44] in his life this is a giant his life see
[31:46] the armies of israel they were terrified
[31:48] of goliath he was
[31:51] probably 10 feet tall he was trained up
[31:53] from his youth probably very strong and
[31:56] very you know and very scary to look at
[31:58] but the thing is he was not see david
[32:01] wasn't trying to co-exist with the giant
[32:03] he knew that giant was defying the
[32:04] armies of the living god
[32:07] and he he told the giant like it was and
[32:09] let's read that story i always loved
[32:10] that story
[32:12] because they was just a man like you and
[32:13] me
[32:15] he was
[32:16] he wasn't some super being or this or
[32:18] that but he was a man like you flesh and
[32:20] blood just like you and i
[32:21] so first samuel 17
[32:24] we'll read that little i love that
[32:25] little story
[32:26] it's not a story but it's it's true it's
[32:29] you can overcome just like he did
[32:36] so first samuel 17 and we'll start with
[32:39] verse 11.
[32:41] so it says when saul and all israel
[32:43] heard those words of the philistines
[32:45] they were dismayed and greatly afraid
[32:46] they were scared of this giant
[32:48] and go to verse 23
[32:51] and as he talked with them behold there
[32:53] came up the champion the philistine of
[32:55] gath goliath by name are the armies of
[32:58] the philistines and spake according
[33:01] to the same words and david heard them
[33:04] and all the men in israel when they saw
[33:05] the man fled from him and were so afraid
[33:08] so fear was just in the midst of them
[33:11] they were just terrified
[33:13] they won other battles but they were
[33:15] kind of like the children of israel they
[33:17] thought they couldn't overcome these
[33:18] this giant in their life
[33:20] and the minimum israel said have you
[33:21] seen this man that has come up surely to
[33:23] defy israel as he come up and it shall
[33:26] be that the man who killeth him the king
[33:29] will enrich him with great riches and
[33:31] will give him his daughter and make his
[33:33] father's house free in israel
[33:35] and david said to the men that stood by
[33:38] him
[33:39] saying what shall be done to the man
[33:40] that killeth this philistine and taketh
[33:43] away the reproach from israel
[33:45] for who is this uncircumcised philistine
[33:48] that should defy the army's living god
[33:50] say the same thing in the life of your
[33:51] giant who is this uncircumcised giant in
[33:53] my life that's trying to take my
[33:55] strength and my joy away
[33:58] and the people answering him after this
[33:59] man are saying so shall be done to the
[34:01] man that killeth him
[34:03] and we'll go to verse 33.
[34:06] and saul said to david thou are not able
[34:08] to go against this philistine to fight
[34:10] with him
[34:11] for the hour but a youth and he a man of
[34:13] war from his youth see man likes to look
[34:16] on the outward appearance of a man
[34:18] but it's the inward that really matters
[34:21] the inward man is what's going to help
[34:22] you overcome
[34:23] not that outward man because they said
[34:25] this bible said dave was ruddy
[34:27] i had a fair countenance he's probably
[34:29] like a little shrimp for all we know
[34:31] but you know but god doesn't care if you
[34:32] have big muscles or if you don't have
[34:34] big muscles he cares about the condition
[34:36] of your heart if you really love him
[34:37] that's what he cares about
[34:39] verse 35 verse 35 and i went out after
[34:41] him i'm sorry verse 34 and david said
[34:44] unto saul thy servant kept his father's
[34:46] sheep there came a lion and a bear and
[34:48] took a lamb out of his flock
[34:50] and i went out after him and smote him
[34:53] and delivered out of his mouth and when
[34:55] he arose against me i caught him by his
[34:57] beard and smote him and slew him
[34:59] thy servant slew both the lion and the
[35:01] bear
[35:02] see he was going back
[35:04] to his victories and saying that if the
[35:07] lord delivered me and helped me with
[35:08] this then i can overcome the same giant
[35:10] that's in my life right now
[35:13] so as i serve and slew both the lion and
[35:15] the bear and this
[35:16] uncircumcised philistine should be one
[35:18] of them saying he had he defiled the
[35:20] armies of the living god
[35:22] david said moreover the lord delivered
[35:24] me out of the paul of the lion and are
[35:26] the paul the bear and what he will
[35:27] deliver me out of the hand of this
[35:30] philistine and saul said unto david go
[35:33] and the lord be with you
[35:35] go to verse 30 9 now
[35:38] and david gird his sword upon his armor
[35:40] and
[35:40] a say to go for he had not proved it and
[35:43] david said unto saul i cannot go with
[35:45] these for i have not proved them and
[35:46] david put them off he didn't want this
[35:48] ecclesiastical armor he didn't want that
[35:50] he knew what god has given him inside of
[35:52] him is all he needed
[35:54] and he took his staff and his hand and
[35:57] chose him five smooth stones notice
[35:59] jesus is five letters faith is five
[36:02] letters you gotta have faith in jesus to
[36:04] overcome
[36:06] and david knew he had faith in god to
[36:07] overcome
[36:08] so remember that
[36:10] same thing david is god is not respecter
[36:12] of persons you get the same faith like
[36:13] david did in god you can have the same
[36:16] faith and strength to overcome
[36:21] took his bag and put them in a
[36:22] shepherd's bag which he had even in a
[36:24] script and his sling was in his hand
[36:26] and he drew near to the philistine and
[36:28] the philistine came and drew near unto
[36:30] david and the man bare the shield went
[36:32] before him
[36:34] and when philistine looked about and saw
[36:36] david he disdained him for he was but a
[36:38] youth and ruddy and of a fair
[36:40] countenance
[36:41] and the philistines said unto david am i
[36:43] a dog that cometh to me with staves and
[36:46] the philistine curse david by his gods
[36:48] and the philistines said to david come
[36:50] to me and i will give thy flesh unto the
[36:52] fowls of the air and to the beasts of
[36:54] the field
[36:55] then said david to the philistine thou
[36:58] comest to me with a sword and with a
[36:59] spear
[37:00] and with a shield i love this right here
[37:02] but i come to thee in the name of the
[37:04] lord of hosts the god of the armies of
[37:07] israel whom thou has to follow come to a
[37:08] giant just like that i come in the name
[37:10] of lord jesus christ he's defeated you
[37:13] you're weak you're a defeated creature
[37:15] you'll no longer take a hold of my life
[37:17] anymore i refuse to coexist with you i
[37:20] refuse for you to be in my mind anymore
[37:22] i'm casting you out
[37:26] so
[37:27] he said i would
[37:29] verse 47 and all this assembly shall
[37:30] know that the lord saveth not with sword
[37:33] not and not spear for the bow is the
[37:35] lord's and he will give you into our
[37:38] hands and it came to pass when the
[37:40] philistines arose
[37:42] and came and drew to meet david that
[37:43] david hastened and ran toward the army
[37:45] and he ran
[37:47] to meet the philistine
[37:49] and david put his hand in his bag and
[37:51] took them to a stone and slang it and
[37:53] smote the philistine in his forehead
[37:55] and the stones sunk into his fort and he
[37:57] fell upon his face to the earth
[37:59] verse 50. so david what prevailed over
[38:02] the philistine with a sling with a stone
[38:05] and when they smote and smote the
[38:06] philistine and slew him but there was no
[38:09] sword in the hand of david therefore
[38:11] david ran and stood upon the philistine
[38:13] and took his sword and drew it out of
[38:15] the sheath and slew it and cut off his
[38:17] head there with and when the philistines
[38:19] saw their champion was dead they fled
[38:22] so we we defeat the enemy he's gonna fl
[38:24] he's gonna flee
[38:26] so like i said don't let the
[38:28] uncircumcised goliath run in your life
[38:31] don't let don't let him call the shots
[38:32] in your life
[38:34] jesus christ is calling you to overcome
[38:37] that giant
[38:38] not to live in fear with it you expose
[38:40] the devil
[38:41] you take a stand and say i'm not living
[38:43] this i'm not living this life anymore i
[38:45] refuse to be a victim no longer don't
[38:47] make yourself a victim a lot of people
[38:48] in this world like to play the victim
[38:50] role and that's why they never can ever
[38:52] grow out of it because they're
[38:53] constantly trying to
[38:55] uh portray the people that i'm a victim
[38:57] you know i'm a victim i'm a victim and
[38:58] that spirit will never help you get
[39:00] anywhere
[39:03] go revelations 12.
[39:08] praise god
[39:14] revelation is 12.
[39:17] we're at 12 11 we're going to go to
[39:21] and they overcame him by the blood of
[39:23] the lamb that's the only way you're
[39:24] going to overcome brother and sister is
[39:26] by his blood his blood that was shed on
[39:28] calvary they overcame him by the blood
[39:30] of the lamb and by the word of their
[39:32] testimony and said i love his part and
[39:34] they love not their lives unto death a
[39:36] lot of people are loving their life so
[39:39] much
[39:41] and they want to put god in certain
[39:43] increments certain parts in their life
[39:45] but this is a sold out life
[39:47] because they literally if you look at
[39:48] the apostles
[39:50] they literally devoted their life to
[39:51] death for the cause of jesus christ they
[39:54] didn't care if they'd be thrown in
[39:54] prison even paul probably wrote most of
[39:56] his letters in prison
[39:59] being stoned being rejected didn't have
[40:01] a lot of friends
[40:02] but he didn't care if it was to win this
[40:04] one soul
[40:05] one soul was worth more than ten
[40:07] thousand worlds remember that
[40:09] if you
[40:10] all heaven rejoices for one sin center
[40:12] repentance amen
[40:14] so
[40:16] i just love that that's just i love that
[40:18] scripture so how can you obtain the mind
[40:20] of christ if you're letting the devil
[40:21] roam around your land
[40:23] the mind of christ is key something we
[40:25] want daily how can you know how to walk
[40:28] worthy humbly
[40:31] in in god's perfect will if you don't
[40:32] have the mind of christ the mind of
[40:34] christ is going to lead you to god's
[40:35] will
[40:36] it's going to help you be more aware see
[40:38] the problem is we have to be more aware
[40:39] and sensitive when the lord's moving the
[40:42] lord is constantly trying to talk to us
[40:44] but we're going a million miles an hour
[40:46] you know anything is get still before
[40:48] god that's the key right there get still
[40:51] and know that i am god that's what he
[40:52] said
[40:53] see we always get what we expect
[40:56] anything
[40:57] well then they usually get what you look
[40:58] for it's the mental attitude you have
[41:01] remember this and never forget it this
[41:03] is from 1950 expectation remember this
[41:06] and never forget it the right mental
[41:08] attitude towards any promise of god will
[41:11] bring it to pass
[41:12] the right mental attitude
[41:14] towards any promise of god it doesn't
[41:16] take gifts of healing to heal sick
[41:17] people any person in here has the right
[41:19] to meet satan anywhere if you're a
[41:22] christian and defeat him on any grounds
[41:24] that he can stand on remember that
[41:26] anybody in here
[41:27] you gotta have faith
[41:29] faith is so key the right attitude a lot
[41:32] of people don't have the right attitude
[41:33] that's why they don't receive from god
[41:35] have that right mental attitude is so
[41:36] key because the word goes into your head
[41:38] into your heart
[41:39] has to pass through there first and go
[41:40] into here
[41:43] so
[41:44] there's another quote from just letting
[41:46] off the pressure from 63. if they're
[41:48] born again they cannot impersonate
[41:49] because they are built for those things
[41:51] they're born regenerated remolded
[41:54] not just something that's patched up
[41:56] and shook on hands got emotion danced on
[41:59] a altar a few times and says i got it
[42:01] it's something that's been remolded
[42:03] regenerated
[42:05] we're called to be regenerated
[42:07] we're trying to get back into the image
[42:09] once we once were before the fall
[42:12] and become a new creature
[42:14] then it can stand the pressures of the
[42:16] persecutions and things that follow the
[42:18] spiritual life
[42:20] you've got to be made and built to stand
[42:22] in the pressure
[42:23] and the only thing that can do it
[42:25] that's when you come into god's molding
[42:27] house right you're in god's morning
[42:28] house right now that's right he wants to
[42:30] mold you he wants to shape you
[42:32] he wants to see more of his image in you
[42:33] he wants to be that masterpiece he wants
[42:35] to make that masterpiece
[42:37] and be torn down and rebuilt that's how
[42:39] you got to be torn down
[42:40] god wants to beat the world out of you
[42:43] and you become a new creature in christ
[42:45] all things become new
[42:49] i'm inside of a tower i don't have no
[42:50] desire to even look out he puts his
[42:52] hands to the plow and even turns back to
[42:54] look is not worthy of plowing
[42:57] what a place to come yes outside you die
[43:00] inside your safe
[43:01] just come in and let off the pressures
[43:03] there's been pressures in your life
[43:05] come into the molding house come into
[43:07] that refuge
[43:08] come into that tower
[43:11] encourages all of us and christ is our
[43:13] tower yes god's provided place of what
[43:16] safety
[43:17] joshua built these those houses in those
[43:19] cities of refuge and god built us a city
[43:22] of refuge that's in his son christ jesus
[43:25] the name of the lord is a mighty tower
[43:27] and the righteous run into it and are
[43:29] safe say it with me the name of the lord
[43:31] is a mighty tower and the righteous run
[43:34] into it and are safe
[43:36] now you say what if i get sick in here
[43:39] he bore our sickness in this tower amen
[43:41] that we're in he bore our sickness and
[43:43] his body we have well you say what if i
[43:45] get weary when you're in there all cares
[43:48] and things cast your cares upon him
[43:50] it's rolled on every wall all the way
[43:52] around every door cast your cares upon
[43:55] him because he cares for you
[43:57] trust in his promised word his words are
[44:00] written on your heart
[44:02] our table our hearts are the tables of
[44:04] his word like martha and mary and all
[44:06] along see there we have in common we
[44:10] have christ christ is our refuge
[44:13] amen
[44:14] amen
[44:16] amen
[44:18] that's the kind of land where he's so
[44:19] worried people don't get to know what to
[44:21] do they say well this is right is that
[44:23] right christ is right is this the way is
[44:25] that the way he said i am the way
[44:27] which is truth this or that jesus said
[44:30] i'm the truth the way the truth the life
[44:33] see
[44:34] we've quit worrying about that that way
[44:36] builds up pressure the trouble of it is
[44:38] today the people don't have time to get
[44:41] to get before god and get still
[44:44] they've got so many things to do they
[44:45] got to they belong to this they got to
[44:48] do this they got to have this they got
[44:50] to go up here you don't even have time
[44:53] right here the devil just took up all
[44:54] your time
[44:55] that's what he's trying to do he's
[44:56] trying to take up all your time he's
[44:58] trying to make you so busy that you just
[45:00] fit god in in certain places
[45:03] and the thing is you have to take a
[45:04] stand
[45:05] see satan isn't going to just move over
[45:07] because you're a christian he's not
[45:10] satan doesn't care he wants to see if
[45:11] you have the real the real goods that's
[45:13] what he's trying to see because he knows
[45:15] we don't have real goods
[45:18] so the thing is you don't have time to
[45:19] get still before god and get quiet
[45:22] do you ever just get go out in the
[45:23] morning after the night has passed early
[45:25] in the morning also it blossoms to get
[45:27] fragrance
[45:28] and did you ever go early for a morning
[45:30] to define the fragrance you find out
[45:31] that early morning
[45:33] when you get out the dew is hanging low
[45:34] the trees are budding the blossoms are
[45:36] coming
[45:37] the perfume
[45:38] go along the road and smell the
[45:40] honeysicles into the rose gardens early
[45:42] in the morning
[45:43] that's why it's been quiet
[45:45] nature has through the night it's got to
[45:48] go quiet got to be quiet and god bathed
[45:50] it with refreshing
[45:52] that's the way you need to do is get
[45:54] away and get quiet before god so
[45:57] he can bathe you with a refreshment from
[45:59] heaven
[46:00] amen get alone to yourself close the
[46:03] doors
[46:04] pull them together and say now lord
[46:06] here i am in your presence
[46:08] that's how that's how personal real has
[46:10] to be
[46:11] get alone get along in your prayer class
[46:13] get your knees and say lord i'm meeting
[46:15] with you i want to hear your voice speak
[46:17] back to me i'm not leaving my knees
[46:19] until i get more of your holy spirit i'm
[46:20] not leaving my knees until i've overcome
[46:22] this addiction that's how serious it has
[46:25] to be
[46:26] it's not just some some game but it's a
[46:28] series this is life or death
[46:30] you can't be an effective as god wants
[46:32] you in his kingdom if you have these
[46:33] things roaming around your life these
[46:35] things are hindrance they're roadblocks
[46:37] but a roadblock is a temporary thing
[46:39] don't let this become a wall
[46:41] take that roadblock out kick that
[46:42] roadblock out
[46:45] remember after all your nature and after
[46:47] all nature gets quiet and still
[46:49] then the dew begins to fall that
[46:51] refreshes and brings forth life
[46:54] we need more life
[46:55] jesus died for us that we have life
[46:58] life and life more abundantly
[47:00] that's what he died for
[47:01] and your nature yourself when you get
[47:03] quiet and still before god then the dew
[47:05] of heaven begins to fall and begins to
[47:07] refresh
[47:08] amen let's go to psalms 27.
[47:13] praise god
[47:18] psalms 27 uh we'll start with verse one

[47:36] foes came upon me to eat my flesh they
[47:39] stumbled and fell

[47:43] love with god so sold out that the enemy
[47:45] doesn't know what to do with you that's
[47:47] how it has to be
[47:48] that he doesn't even know he's

[50:14] the name of the lord is a strong tower
[50:17] the righteous run into it in a safe
[50:21] when the world tries to capsize your
[50:22] ship
[50:23] the name of the lord is a strong tower

[50:29] dart at you

[50:33] when your family forsakes you the name
[50:36] of the lord is a strong tower and the
[50:38] righteous runneth into it and is safe
[50:40] when the enemy is trying to get you
[50:42] frustrated and confused remember what it
[50:44] feels like when you're back against the
[50:45] wall and you're not alone remember you
[50:47] are not alone he said i'll be with you
[50:51] and in you and to the end of the world
[50:54] remember the name of the lord is a
[50:56] strong tower and the righteous run it
[50:58] into it and it's safe
[50:59] when the enemy when the enemy says you
[51:01] can't get the holy ghost remember the
[51:02] enemy is a liar
[51:04] stay on your knees in prayer and say
[51:05] lord i'm not leaving until i receive
[51:07] your holy ghost i'm not leaving until i
[51:09] meet every requirement to receive the
[51:10] holy ghost and if you already have the
[51:12] holy ghost get bored
[51:14] get your knees to get more holy ghost
[51:16] look in the book of acts the apostles
[51:18] got filled again with the holy ghost and
[51:20] he gave him boldness to go and speak
[51:21] that gospel that's what we need is
[51:23] boldness to go speak this gospel we
[51:25] don't need this we're not trying to make
[51:27] some mark convert or some brother roger
[51:28] convert we're trying to make a jesus
[51:30] christ convert you got to lead them to
[51:32] jesus christ he's the only way
[51:35] he's going to change their lives you
[51:36] can't change that person's life i can't
[51:37] change that person's life but jesus
[51:39] christ can if you lead him to the source
[51:41] to that fountain there is a fountain
[51:42] that's filled with blood
[51:44] so let's let's leave these these people
[51:45] to christ and it's up to them to make
[51:47] that decision i can't give anybody
[51:49] revelation you can't
[51:50] but the very god of heaven given
[51:52] revelation
[51:54] so you ask
[51:55] if you want to get a true convert you
[51:56] got to leave in jesus christ you have to
[51:59] you have to that's the only way
[52:02] so praise god
[52:05] so remember the name of the lord is a
[52:07] strong tower
[52:08] the righteous runneth into it and are
[52:10] safe
[52:11] i like this song in the presence of
[52:13] jehovah we don't sing the uh the verses
[52:15] but this one is really just kind of hits
[52:16] home
[52:17] through his love the lord provided
[52:20] a place for us to rest
[52:22] a place to find the answers in the hour
[52:24] of distress
[52:26] now there's never any reason for you to
[52:28] give up in despair just slip away and
[52:30] breathe his name for he will surely meet
[52:34] you there
[52:36] i'll always love that
[52:38] if you have heartaches if you have pain
[52:40] you have suffering
[52:41] meet with him in that secret place
[52:44] prayer is so important in this day and
[52:46] age
[52:47] the enemy is constantly trying to get us
[52:49] to take any other substitute but prayer
[52:52] but we can get impr that's where your
[52:53] strength comes from it's a direct
[52:54] connection with the throne room between
[52:56] you and jesus
[52:57] bow at the master's feet
[52:59] he hears your every heart's cry he knows
[53:02] what you're going through
[53:03] but the thing is you have to submit to
[53:05] him
[53:06] if you look let's go a couple more
[53:07] scriptures i'm going to go to i'm sorry
[53:09] it's not on the notes but
[53:10] hey laura's pulling me to i'm not going
[53:12] to say sorry so let's go let's go to
[53:14] james 4.
[53:23] james 4
[53:25] verse 6.
[53:27] he giveth more grace wherefore you saith
[53:30] god resisted the proud but give the
[53:32] grace unto the humble
[53:34] so pride likes to
[53:36] act like humility
[53:38] pride likes to lift itself up
[53:40] pride says i'm good at this you know i'm
[53:42] better than you it may not say those
[53:44] exact words but the way
[53:46] it conducts itself the way it lives
[53:48] it doesn't edify a person it actually
[53:51] pulls a person down
[53:53] so he said he give the grace unto the
[53:55] humble says submit yourselves therefore
[53:57] to god so if you want to overcome that
[53:59] john your life
[54:00] first you got to submit yourselves
[54:02] therefore to god
[54:03] resist the devil and he will flee from
[54:05] you because he knows that your strength
[54:08] can't defeat him but he knows that jesus
[54:09] christ strength will defeat him ten
[54:11] times out of ten not nine times but ten
[54:13] times out of ten
[54:16] verse uh so verse eight draw nigh to god
[54:18] and he will draw that's the key right
[54:19] there that's a formula you gotta draw
[54:21] now to god first then he'll draw an eye
[54:23] to you
[54:26] cleanse your hand this is the part you
[54:27] play cleanse your hands these centers
[54:29] and purify your hearts you double-minded
[54:30] a double-minded man is unstable in all
[54:32] his ways you can't waver to here way
[54:34] over there you gotta have a perfect
[54:35] balance stay right in the middle that
[54:37] straighten arrow is right down the
[54:38] middle
[54:40] says be afflicted and mourn and weep let
[54:43] your laughter be turned to mourning in
[54:44] your joy to heaviness verse 10 right
[54:46] here so key humble yourselves in the
[54:49] sight of the lord and he shall lift you
[54:51] up
[54:53] humble yourselves you play as you right
[54:55] there you play that part you got to
[54:56] humble yourself in the mighty hand of
[54:58] jesus christ
[54:59] let's go with the first peter i believe
[55:00] 3 15 i believe
[55:04] or sorry first peter five
[55:09] five through seven sorry first peter
[55:11] five
[55:12] five through nine will read
[55:14] so it says likewise younger submit
[55:17] yourself there yourself therefore unto
[55:19] the elder
[55:20] yea all of you be subject one to another
[55:22] and be what clothed with humility
[55:25] for god resisted the proud and give the
[55:28] grace unto the humble once again he's
[55:30] saying the same same thing
[55:32] god resisted the proud and give the
[55:34] grace unto the humble so if you have a
[55:36] prideful spirit god can never get a hold
[55:38] of you he can never mold you he can
[55:40] never shape you the way he wants to you
[55:42] have to get rid of that pride first god
[55:44] even hates a proud look it says in the
[55:45] word in proverbs
[55:47] it says humble yourselves therefore
[55:48] under the mighty hand of god if you look
[55:51] this is pointing us to humble ourselves
[55:52] huma you can never be too humble in the
[55:54] sight of god humility if you win
[55:56] somebody over humility is the key you
[55:58] have to move out the way and let jesus
[56:00] speak through you
[56:02] so humber says therefore in the mighty
[56:04] hand of god that he may exalt you in due
[56:06] time casting all your cares upon him for
[56:09] he careth for you
[56:10] be sober be vigilant because your
[56:13] adversary the devil as a royal lion says
[56:16] as a roaring lion walketh about seeking
[56:18] whom may devour whom resist steadfast in
[56:20] the faith knowing that the same
[56:22] afflictions are accomplishing your
[56:23] brother and that in the world
[56:24] but the god of all grace who hath called
[56:27] us unto what his eternal glory by christ
[56:30] jesus after you have suffered a while
[56:33] make you perfect establish strengthen
[56:36] and settle you
[56:38] and then we'll close with matthew 11
[56:42] 28.
[56:45] praise god
[56:52] matthew 11 28 says
[56:58] come unto me
[56:59] all ye that labor and are heavy laden
[57:01] and i will give you rest
[57:03] if you're filled and cumbered with the
[57:05] lord with the cares of this life if
[57:07] you're feeling overwhelmed
[57:08] he says come unto me all
[57:10] ye that are labor and heavy laden he
[57:13] says i will give you rest
[57:15] take my yoke upon you and learn of me
[57:17] fry a meek and lowly
[57:19] in heart and you shall find rest unto
[57:21] your souls that's the key you want rest
[57:24] unto your souls
[57:25] i don't want rest unto my flesh but into
[57:27] my soul because if your soul is rested
[57:29] it doesn't matter what happens to your
[57:30] body it doesn't matter if you get sick
[57:32] on your death bed because you know where
[57:33] you're going because you need that rest
[57:35] inside
[57:36] otherwise other stuff's not going to
[57:38] matter your is going to get healed to
[57:39] get sick again but if you have rest into
[57:41] your soul it doesn't matter
[57:46] for my yoke is easy and my burden is
[57:48] like
[57:50] we can let's stand and invite the
[57:51] musicians
