father we want to thank you that we can lift up our hands lift up our voices and express lord to you the king of kings the lord of lords that you're the lord of our life and we worship you as the lord of our life we praise you lord we lord we thank you for making yourself known to us that you are the lord of all lords the king of all kings and we come here into your house to worship you to honor you to love you and to bow before you and to give you the praise that you're worthy of lord oh we thank you that we can bow before you lord bow our hearts before you we worship you we praise you today lord [Music] praise you jesus say amen amen praise the lord everyone god bless each of you today he is the reason why we're here we've often heard he's the reason for the season he's the reason that we gather together amen amen well if you'd like to turn with us in the book of revelations chapter 3 for opening scripture we've been doing the start a little series on the enemy that works within us and uh last sunday we spoke on detecting the uh the enemy within us and uh i could just uh for a second take a little census and i need you to be just super duper honest with me uh it's okay if if you don't participate and it's okay however you answer but how many has practiced more in this last week detecting the enemy within you than you have in the past okay all right and and how many has uh been at least trying to detect the enemy more within this is so vital in order to disarm because if you don't recognize something you can't disarm it now we've been in situations where we're just in a battle and we just how do i defuse this thing well if the enemy is always outside you never know how to do it you never know how to control but you can control the enemy inside amen amen let's look to the lord in prayer before we read these words heavenly father we thank you lord that you've made it possible that we could gather once more in your house to honor the resurrection lord you've blessed each one of us with salvation we're ever grateful for it today we could not thank you enough we cannot worship you enough but we thank you for this time that we we've had to worship you in song and to lift up our voices and not have to be dictated by somebody else what we're allowed to say what we're not allowed to say but lord express our love and our thanksgiving to you today it's a privilege that we have today we thank you for that these doors are open we thank you for the liberty that we have here and lord we pray that lord that you would you would come in the way of revelation to your word now lord this important part of you building your church in us and teaching us how to overcome all things lord we're depending on you and pray that you would not bypass anyone but that each one would feel your spirit know your presence know you're speaking to them and see the simplicity of just saying amen to whatever you would say granted lord we commit the service to you we love you we thank you for these things for we ask in jesus name amen amen revelations chapter three these are familiar scriptures starting with verse number 21. to him that overcometh will i grant to sit with me in my throne even as i have overcame and sat down with my father and his throne he that have an ear to hear let him hear with the spirit uh he that have an ear to hear let him hear with the spirit is saying unto the church amen and then revelation chapter 21 how many want to hear from the lord today amen we we need an ear we need an ear and god uh you know we were born with natural ears but that doesn't mean we were born with spiritual ears that takes a yearning and a desire right you the more you hunger the more that you'll hear amen revelation chapter 21 and starting with verse number 5 21 verse 5 and he that sat upon the throne said behold i make all things new that includes us includes our nature inside i make all things new he's in the new business and he said unto me right for these words are true and faithful and he said unto me it is done i am the alpha and the omega the beginning and the end i will give unto him that is a thirst of the fountain of the water of life freely he that overcometh shall inherit all things and i will be his god and he shall be my son now look what happens if we don't overcome but the fearful and the unbelieving and the abominable and the murders and the whoremongers and the sorcerers and the idolaters and all the liars shall have their part in the lake of fire which burneth uh in the part of the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone which is the second death may god bless you may be seated if we overcome all things we inherit all things and this is the hardest age brother said is the most wicked it's the most horrible it's it's dark it's deceiving you can't believe anybody can't trust anybody can't trust the thoughts that come into your head it is the hardest age to overcome but if we overcome it we inherit all things and being that it is the hardest we need all the word to overcome it we cannot in this fight that we're in get scared and say you know what i i i'm just backing off you can't do that because you'll never be found as an overcomer you can't be scared of anything the bride is fearless the righteousness bold is a lion you have to be fearless good example that is david david goliath now the more we practice identifying the enemy within us and exposing him the more we'll be able to disarm him it is the key to a victorious walk if you question you know why don't i got joy why am i doing this why ain't doing that why where where's the peace where's the where's my lung suffering where's my pace when you when you're con asking those questions about yourself the problem is within it's nothing without it's nothing somebody did to you it's nothing about the preaching just listen to a brother branham tape because that's who god sent that's who god sent with the message if you can listen to that tape and your life is turned upside down and you got the victory that i say keep listening to the tape but it's not the preaching jesus said he that have an ear you've got to hear what the preaching is actually saying amen we don't want to settle for just holding on to being a son or a daughter of god or i'm in the message or i'm bride you don't want to settle for that we got to have enough faith to overcome the flesh the self nature to just get by to walk in the spirit exhibiting the fruits of the spirit joy peace long suffering that's what we must have to take the land that god has promised for our lives psalms 27 verse 12 says deliver me not over unto the will of my enemies for false witnesses are risen up against me deliver me not over to the will of my enemies your flesh has a will and it is your enemy and when you yield to it you've been delivered over to the will you ever been in such a rage such a fight such an anger it's like you can't even hardly control yourself you've been given over to the will of your enemy you think you're fighting the enemy who you're who you're angry against you haven't been given over to their will but you've been given over the will of your flesh and we need deliverance from that amen the enemy unquestionably works within us but our pride will question that you know we don't want to really accept the devil's innocence usually in somebody else we'll go as far as saying they really bring out the worst of me the scripture declares greater is he that's in you than he that's in the world we may look at that scripture and we may say you know that just shows you that god is in me and and the devil's out in the world out there but really what that means is greater is the holy ghost that's inside of us than he that is in your worldly nature that you've been born with and you've got to believe that one is greater than the other now if you do nothing your natural nature will take over and the the the proof of that is before you came to the lord you did what you wanted to do we all the bible says we all had our conversations in times past and lust of the flesh doing the desires that we wanted to do and the only way that ever stops is when you say i'm done with that and you crucify it and you say i'm going to do the will of god of course you can't do it on your own you need to become born again you need the holy ghost but it isn't something that's done away with just because you repented and you got baptized otherwise jesus would have never said you have to die daily paul would have never said he had to die daily brother brandon would have said you never had to die so it's there is there till we leave so we got to keep it under we have to keep it dead paul affirmed that there was a law of sin inside his members that were warned against his mind a law of sin in other words just there with the flesh he said when he would go to do good evil was present with me now he didn't ask for it he didn't want it but it was still present with him it's here today we brought it to church now if you got serious and you crucified the old man then he can't do you any harm brother branham said we're in the greatest battle over fault and it's still going on today in our minds we can't run away from it we can't ignore we must defeat the enemy within us we must overcome amen satan has been working on doing inside jobs from the beginning he didn't wrestle uh eve to the ground in a headlock he didn't come to eve and start fighting physically calling our names it was something that happened within each one of us must become good detectives trying and discerning the spirits that come to us and then we must learn to disarm them because they're not going away on their own you ever ever watch a movie where there's like a bomb and they got to call the bomb squad in it's in the bob squad comes in they've got those suits on they're going like this or walking over and they're you know they gotta look at it and the time's ticking away and they got these wires they don't know if they should cut the red one or the you know what i'm talking about they want to disarm the bomb before it blows up if you don't disarm the enemy it's going to blow up please please go with me paul said they that are in the flesh they mine the things of the flesh i'm holy ghost filled okay great but if you are in the flesh you're going to mind the things of the flesh why it's not because of you but it's because your flesh is just like everybody else's flesh and whether you don't know god or you know god or you have god the flesh still acts the same are you with me that's all there is to it so the key is walk in the spirit get in the spirit stand in the spirit dance in the spirit pray in the spirit get out of the flesh know the difference brother brahm said in the message the greatest battle of her fault he said there's something about it if you're ever alone that way talking about the desert of arizona he says there's something that draws you there i i guess is one reason i like those away places you get away from the power of the enemy so much as we have here he said a devil is almost harmless unless he has something to work in he says you remember those devils that were cast out of legion they wanted to do more mischief so they went into the hogs so devils must have something to work in somebody to work through i'd like to take this beautiful thought and disarm the enemy within us how many believe that god is hid in simplicity his truth is hidden simplicity and that's where we'll find him i believe that god has given us scriptural direction how to disarm the enemy if we don't allow the enemy to work through us he can't do anything to harm us what a thought did not the prophet say my greatest enemy is me well if you disarm your nature he can't work through you we must learn to disarm our human nature i want that to sink deep the better detective you become and seeing what the devil is working in your thoughts and your feelings the more you'll be able to disarm them right there based on a newly discovered secret documents from the german archives diaries and newspapers of that time gun control in the third right presents the definitive yet hidden mystery of how the nazi regime made use of gun control to disarm and repress its enemies and consolidate power and render political opponents and jews defenseless they took the guns away they had a purpose for doing that there's certain political people today that may want you to believe that the reason they want to take the guns this way is to to disarm the bad people and control the violence that's going on sounds like a good reason but reality the spirit behind that is to disarm the people of america to take away our second amendment they may not recognize that they may not know it but the spirit that's behind it look they this country is going to be blown up i was talking to somebody just yesterday didn't know the prophet but he began to he works on uh the the the programming and the communications of cars that don't need anybody in it and i began to share with him the seven things that happened that the prophet talked about and one of them was the driverless vehicle and they said oh he said i told him six of the seven have come to pass he said that's pretty good betting average what was the seven so i told them it's going to happen it's going to happen the the the spirit is against us i'm thankful for the liberty that i have today to worship god and if it wasn't in uh in the constitution we would not be able to gather together somebody stood up and said i don't care if it's covered or not we're gathering together to worship you can't take that right away from me they want to even change the constitution you change the constitution you miles will just change what america is that's what they want to do i say if you want to change something go somewhere and change it don't change this don't change the word of god stay with the word of god amen if a nation can disarm their people they can set up an absolute monarchy or dictatorship if a nation can disarm a nation they will have nothing to fight with look at the united states they've been trying to disarm certain other nations from using their nuclear power is that true because they don't want them to use that power and blow up other things so disarming is a strategy of control and the devil is constantly working at disarming christians taking away their defense so they can't fight and we need to come to grips with the greatest battle that's in progress right now in our minds and each one of us learn to recognize the devil trying to work on the inside of us and disarm him take control because if you do not let the devil use you he can't do you any harm it's that simple you disarm the enemy by disarming your nature you take away his armor his artillery his power against you you take away the ability to hurt you when you don't let him use you think about when we were little kids or we watch little kids and we tell them don't put anything in that electrical socket and the first thing they want to do is find out what happens when you put something in the electrical socket that's why the devil offers another way an easier way a funner way you get that in your head and you want to try it out you've got to disarm that disarm him amen resist and he'll flee we'll get into that maybe in part three a little bit more but if we learn to disarm our human nature we have disarmed the devil from penetrating us because he doesn't have anything to work through remember a devil is almost harmless unless he can have something to work in devils must have something to work in somebody to work through so let's forget about one another i can't stop the devil in you but i can stop them and me because there's three more agency know dev the lord cannot control you against your will he's just he's a gentleman he's a he's that type of god if that's what you want that is what you'll have everybody that's going to hell is people who did not want god they made a choice he didn't send anybody there because he wanted to you know pleasure in the death of the wicked and everybody that goes to heaven they wanted to go they wanted him so god can't do anything against your will and i can't do anything against the devil that would be inside somebody but i can control this ground right here and if you learn to do that you'll be able to learn to dis-fuse and help other people with problems what do you mean brother john well the bible says a soft answer turns away wrath that when you lay down your life and you turn your cheek and you go the second mile and you learn to do what christ did then you can help the other person but going ahead and trying to prove somebody is wrong prove that they got a devil prove that where there's forget it you dis are this message is about you and your relationship with christ that's what this message is for we all battle with devils we all battle with not letting the devil use us we all but do we battle with disarming the devil within us disarm that nature that's if you see this you'll look at the scriptures different than you've ever seen them before now those of you that heard the last service i want you to take time and go back there and and see because there was many examples of how the spirit of the enemy works in us tricks this gets us caught up and we don't even recognize it well if you don't recognize it you can't do nothing with it but i'm going to just take one of them and i'm going to go through because jesus taught us you'll follow those examples he taught us how to disarm the enemy so matthew chapter 16 verse 21 and from that time forth began jesus to show unto his disciples how that he must go to jerusalem and suffer many things of the elders and the chief priests scribes be killed and be raised again the third day peter took him he began to rebuke him say it be it far from thee lord this shall not be unto thee now he thought he was perfectly in line standing for his pastor and he and he turned jesus turned he said unto peter get thee behind me satan thou are an offense unto me for thou savers not the things that be of god but those that be of men after jesus brings an awareness of what's happening in peter's mind he immediately teaches his disciples how to disarm the enemy look at the next verse the very next verse he teaches it then said jesus unto his disciples if any man will come after me let him deny himself take up his cross and follow me this is how you take away the devil's weaponry our human satanic nature of doing our own will because that's where peter was at he was teaching peter this is how you disarm your that devil from letting use you the word of god is the absolute not what you think about the word of god the word of god is our absolute deny deny deny self-will if any man come after me let him deny himself deny self-will pick up pick up what pick up the cross what is the cross it's god's will god's will is always always always always going to feel like a cross if it's not i'd be questioning whether it's god's will because god's will is not all a better roses and cherries and enjoyable and fame and fortune and recognition no it isn't it may know what you think it is but it's a life of living for others and if you do that you'll have the the strength to have a victorious walk whosoever will save his life his own will whosoever will save his own will shall lose it and whosoever will lose his life his will for my sake shall find it he's teaching his disciples how to disarm the enemy ground within them so the enemy can't use them he's still there he's still in the fleshly nature he can still pop out anytime but if you if you're dead to the flesh he's harmless he can't do anything i mean i i haven't thought about a lot of examples but you see these people who take these snakes and they're holding them and they're wrapped around them and they're kissing them and like i hate snakes if that's your snake better keep your eye on him because he comes near me he's out and i'm not waiting to the third round but we ought to better look at that devil and say i'm not afraid of you because i am not letting you use this nature to do what you want we all have that lust and desire and craving to do our own will to be lazy and not do the things of god that thing must be dead and when you have crucified it when you're dead to it you can be fearless and know that you stand in the power and the presence of almighty god for what is a man profited if he shall gain the whole world lose his own soul what shall a man give in exchange of his soul some good questions what would we gain if we were able to conquer every enemy in the whole world outside of us and never ever conquer the enemy within us we'd still go to hell but you could never ever conquer any enemy outside of you but if you conquered the enemy within you you would have salvation and you would have overcomed all things so who cares what's happening out in the world who cares about well i'm going to do this i'm going to do this and this is right and that's wrong who cares look at the enemy inside of you the man that gets in the way that keeps you from doing the will of god so often we want to conquer somebody to gain something conquer their opinion about you for your reputation prove that they're wrong so you can gain something from it it's it's vain it's vain but when you can get serious i'm real serious about the enemy that lives in me i'm serious about this nature that just wants to get up in the morning do a couple prayers and then do what it wants all day say i'm a christian i'm in the message and the enemy's flourishing how is god getting glory in that come on you can gain it all and never overcome your will and lose everything we must disarm the enemy within us by disarming our self-will amen see you're not going to destroy the devil from existence because god created him for a purpose but you can take away his ability to hurt you and god willing if it be his will next sunday we want to talk about how to destroy the devil in your life but we first have to disarm him take away his weaponry doubles must have something to work in they need somebody to work through the devils enjoy working in our pride disarm the enemy within by disarming your pride put on the armor of humility talking about disarming the enemy humility will disarm the devil he won't have anything to work through you've taken away the battleground of his repentantry and put on the armor of humility first peter chapter five verse five first peter chapter five verse five likewise younger submit yourselves unto the elder yeah all of you be subject one to another and be clothed with humility for god resists the proud and giveth grace to the humble if you do not put on humility god is not going to fight your battles god is not going to sit there and fight for you with your pride that's why when you're fighting you're angry and you think you're better and this and that god isn't on that side you may say well i know that that doesn't matter your pride is what's resisting god is keeping god away from fighting for you amen be clothed with humility god gives more grace to a humble person how are you going to get help from god when your pride repels him away forces him back the word resist means to arrange oneself against that is to uphold so when god resisted the problem he arranges himself in such a way that he resists that type of spirit now what is he against when we talk about pride we're talking about he's against your attitude that you have right now we're not talking about your you still could be a son of god still be a a member of the bride of christ but we're talking about dealings we're talking about heaven because i'll tell you what you say you're right about something somebody came and they punched you right in the nose and you said i know you were wrong you deserve this you are not after you're done with what you think you're doing at that point you're not going to walk away with victory because we don't render evil for evil we don't give back what is given to us we don't put in place vengeance is god's he puts things in order we're set to the defense of the gospel to be christ if you could love that person that just punched you now they've seen something that they've never seen before come on only christ could lay down his life when they spit on them and they did all those things it's the nature of that's the true love of god to say father forgive they don't know what they're doing the very god that loves us will arrange himself against us when we're proud when we have a spirit of pride on us the very god that we try to serve will oppose us if we don't clothe ourselves with humility now it isn't just saying i i agree and being humble it's about you you all put on clothes today you notice the the rest of the clothes were kept in your closet in your drawers but you put these on you distinctively went this is it this is what i'm putting on this is some of you ironed today and i tell you you didn't go to the dirty clothes and just pick out something that been there for a week underneath the pile you have to choose to put on clothes of humility you have to look at them you see the difference this is it this is the right clothes to wear to put humility on it's the only way you'll ever stop the devil in your life if humility is not there you'll never disarm the enemy you disarm the enemy by being clothed with humility by submitting not only to the elder but to one another in the fear of god the bible says when you are humble the enemy won't be able to work through you when you're proud he's coming he's got an open door pride is like this i don't mind i'll just come right on in that's pride is an open door for the enemy to work through us humble yourselves therefore under the mighty hand of god that he may exalt you in due time now if you're in a fight of course most of the fights that we get into are not physical fights they're mental emotional arguments not too many physical fights so you're not gonna get exalted right then and there right don't look for it there because you're not getting exalted until due time now you're in the playing field of humbling yourself before the lord god has grace for his children but he reserves grace for the right conditions in due time we need to pray that god would give us the grace that we need to walk humbly before him pay our dues be humble in situations that people rise up against us or a situation rises up against us or our bill went up or our tires flat or something happened that you don't agree with we still must remain under the mighty hand of god we must humble ourselves under the mighty hand of god now when we're doing that we're disarming the enemy to work through us we see david's desperation when he asked here in psalms 13 verse 2. he said how long shall i take counsel in my soul having sorrow in my heart daily how long shall my enemy be exalted over me how long shall my carnal self-will and pride be exalted over me to whom you yield yourself servants to obey his servant you are if you yield your flesh it's only going to want its will if you yield your heart and your spirit to god well then you're going to be exalted over your flesh psalms 18 verse 7 17 he delivered me from my strong enemy and from them that hated me how many wants to be delivered from the strong enemy inside you for they were too strong for me it's true we cannot handle those demons on our own we need jesus he's a strong tower the righteous can run into and are safe i can't do all things through christ you strengtheneth me amen all we need to do is trust in the lord enough to humble yourself and he will exalt you over your enemy in due time now that's scripture god wants to exalt you above your flesh above your greatest enemy not above your outside enemy you're supposed to love them he doesn't want to exalt you above your problem that you're having with some other person i'm sorry that's not your you're supposed to love that person that's friendly fire he wants you to be exalted above the enemy here that's keeping you from laying down your life from loving those outside you he's teaching us this morning how to disarm the enemy within us and i'll say if you're not having that interest in really building your relationship with christ this may be extremely unprofitable for you but if you can get this you will never ever ever need have to have somebody helping you all the time it's learning to take the devil on yourself we don't want to humble ourselves just to god's level now what i mean by that is when you're doing your will you've exalted yourself against god you're being asked to humble yourself not humble yourself just to god's level to the place you say well i'll do this if you do that well if i come to church you got to do this if i pay my time no humble yourself under the mighty hand of god get as low as you can get because he's the one that will prosper your life he was the one that gives you victory he's the one that gives you faith over demons he's the one that gives you faith in the name of jesus in the name of jesus demons have to leave they have to leave this this mind these thoughts this heart this this preeminence in my nature but we have to subject ourselves he gives us grace if we humble ourselves under the mighty hand of god let him guide and direct your path acknowledge the lord in all thy ways and he promised to direct our paths amen our pride literally pushes god away from helping you and allows the enemy to use you how many likes mosquitoes good one good call we're all we're all with you on this one how many users off or has used off or some other thing like off to get rid of the mosquitoes and you read it's supposed to repel repel our pride can repel god humility repels the devil he doesn't have a vessel to work through lord help me to get through this this is so precious when you humble yourself the enemy won't have you to work in all sudden you're in victory you got joy you got peace because the devil isn't there crowning you over with depression and negativity first peter chapter 5 verse 7 casting all your care upon him for he careth for you cast all your care upon free care cast means to throw upon the lord your anxiety your your cares of anxiety the cause of anxiety your state that your your your the depression and the negativity that's going in your mind cast it on him that word means attitude of excessive attentiveness do you got things in your life that you have excessive attentiveness to cast it on the lord cast your cares upon the lord david said in psalms 61 verse 1 hear my cry o god attend unto my prayer from the end of the earth while i cry unto thee when my heart is overwhelmed lead me to the rock that is higher than i for thou has been a shelter for me a strong tower from my from the enemy amen he can help us cast your cares upon the lord psalms 25 1 unto thee o lord do i lift up my soul unto thee o lord do i lift up my soul oh my god i trust in thee let me not be ashamed let not my enemies triumph over me i don't want my flesh triumph over me i don't want to have some negative attitude some i i just that's your enemy triumphing over you you got to trust in the lord god deliver me humble yourself from the mighty hand of god don't and just destroy the ground the ammunition that the devil wants to use inside of you when the devil comes and he sees that there's nothing to work with there's just the love of god the humility of jesus christ all of a sudden he he just goes and sees he looks for somebody else it's a god's truth he goes and he looks for somebody else psalms 41 verse 11 by this i know that thou favors me how many wants to know if you found favor with god by this i know that thou favorest me because my enemy does not triumph over me when you know that your flesh is underneath you found favor with god because he gives grace to the humble if you want more favor with god humble yourself under the mighty hand of god and your carnal selfish nature and then he will lift you up in due season amen first peter chapter five verse eight going back to first peter chapter five be sober be vigilant because your adversary the devil is a royal line walketh about seeking whom he may devour now the per the people that are not going to church that don't care about going to church that are just doing their own thing is he seeking to devour them good answer because he already has them he's looking for somebody who's not totally into their will now obviously the devil can't hurt everyone according to this scripture he's looking he's walking about seeking whom he may devour he may not he can't devour everybody in the devil's pursuit for destruction he's seeking out those who are not walking humbly who are walking in pride who are not under the mighty hand of god those vessels in which are available for his use you come to church and you're prayed up and you're in the spirit the definitely good chance the devil ain't going to use you in church to disrupt the service but if you come in a carnal mindset and you haven't humbled yourself before the devil can use you he's looking for vessels that are open for carnality vessels that he can easily work through to fight to judge or condemn others vessels that are living for themselves full pride and self-will those are vessels in whom he can devour that's why we got to keep this flesh crucified amen that's who he's looking for those are whom he may devour those whom he has something to work in something to work through that's what brother branham said a devil is almost harmless if he doesn't have anybody to work through the devils enjoy working in people's self-will and pride we need to disarm them by disarming our self-will and disarming our pride now there's people that you talk to you hear they're just so full of pride you can see it a mile away you know what i'm talking about you just you don't even feel comfortable being around them and then there's people that are just so full of humility you just you know they wouldn't do anything to hurt you and then you got the people that are in between that's where we all sit and this is where we must learn to disarm ourselves amen so the enemy can be disarmed the devil can't touch any of you when you're walking in the spirit can't touch any of you outside of it you're a target the devil can devour you he can steal your joy your peace your victory the devil can devour you when you let him use you if you don't recognize the spirit of your thoughts that are coming into your mind you're an open door for the devil to come in and use you if you think every thought that comes in your head is okay to think about you're you're an easy target for the devil galatians chapter 5 verse 13 for brethren we have been called you have been called unto liberty humming's been called to liberty we've been set free but what is the tendency of our flesh only not use liberty for an occasion to the flesh oh i don't have to do that i'm a christian god loves me only use not liberty for an occasion to the flesh but by love serve one another for all the laws is fulfilled in one word even this thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself but if you bite and devour one another take he that ye be not consumed one of another this i say then walk in the spirit and you shall not fulfill the lust of the flesh when you are biting and devouring somebody you are letting the devil use your vessel to devour them so just being negative to somebody because they're wrong doesn't mean you're in the will of god if we don't recognize the spirit that's using us that's hurting us we may not recognize the spirit in us hurting somebody else we got to take care of the territory take care of the territory right here disarm the enemy by disarming your fleshly nature your self-will your pride anything that comes between you and doing the will of god live a humble life get humble think humble walk humble be humble and devil will about to use you first peter chapter 5 verse 8 be sober be vigilant because your adversary the devil is a roaring lion walketh about seeking whom he may devour walk in the spirit be sober be vigilant recognize all the spirits that are speaking to you disarm the enemy by disarming your carnality don't give the devil a chance to work through you not even for a moment whom resists steadfast in the faith knowing that the same afflictions are accomplished in your brethren that are in the world in other words everything that you're going through same thing everybody else is going through they're in the greatest battle for fault too every believer has to deal with the same battle the same afflictions the same carnality james chapter 1 verse 14 but every man is tempted when he's drawn away of his own lust and enticed then when lust have conceived it bring forth sin and sin when his finish is bringing forth death the devil knows how to entice us he knows how to give you what you want we you know the devil isn't somebody that just is just a tormentor and keeps you up at night it's the same dude that gives you what you want during the daytime it's the same one he'd just beat you up at night over it detect and disarm the enemy within james chapter 4 verse 6 but he giveth more grace unto the humble wherefore he saith god resisted the proud but giveth grace to the home submit yourselves therefore to god resist the devil and he'll flee from you draw nigh to god he will draw nigh to you cleanse your hands you sinners purify your hearts ye double-minded god is presenting us how we can disarm the enemy we have something to do with a cleansing to do a purifying to do don't the bible says a double-minded man is unstable in all his ways can you imagine if afterwards i said to you we're gonna go right down here to um oh sorry uh just mcdonald's and we're going to eat i want you to follow me i'm buying about three quarters of the way there i say you know what i want to go up to flint there's a place up if i met some place i want to take you to and we go up there in mexico let's come on up there he said okay john changed his mind let's understand them and i said i get three quarters away there and say no i want to go back over here to mcdonald's and i do that about two or three times and you would conclude i need to pray for my pastor there's something wrong there's a little unstableness going on in his mind you got to cleanse yourself from that way of thinking the way it the flesh wants to do this the spirit wants to do this well as long as i go to church as long as i do this long as i'm in the message i can go ahead and i can do this you got to cleanse yourself from that thinking god is calling us to him sold out to him lock stock and barrel now we may not all be there but we should be pressing towards that mark we got to be he's showing us how to disarm the enemy if you don't give them your brain to feed on you'll be able to have the victory amen people struggle in building relationships they expect the other party in the relationship to do all the heavy lifting all the caring to make the relationship better you know what i'm talking about god doesn't do one-sided caring relationships jesus said if you love me then keep my commandments he believes on both sides if you love me keep my commandments humble yourself do some of the heavy lifting self-deny your flesh just don't do what you want to do and expect me to do it all so if you want to build your relationship with god start lifting the load start drawing nigh to god start doing the things that he's telling you to do don't wait till you feel good this is not a feel-good relationship there he called his his chosen apostles disciples they disciplined themselves he didn't call him the good feeling group now how do we do this how do we cleanse how do we purify how do we take care of a double mind be afflicted mourn weep let your laughter be turned to mourning your joy to heaviness humble yourself in the sight of the lord and he shall lift you up god wants you to do more than just say i want to be better he wants you to actually put some heart into it put some heart put some time into it there are so many times that we end up walking in our flesh and we do not detect the enemy within us until it's too late a lot of times we don't recognize it because we're not caring enough to try the spirits we think that everything that we're thinking is okay we think we got to handle we don't need god to discern anything what we're thinking we know whether it's right or wrong it's not an hour to be spiritual lazy we need to pinch our conscience we are living in lukewarm laodiceans and you may have gotten a victory over it but an hour later i'm telling you the devil he wants to come by talk to you we need to stand up as soldiers of the cross jesus said the flesh is weak but the spirit is willing we need to feed the white dog amen that's right stop feeding the black dog romans chapter 8 verse 12 praise the lord now if you get more into the word you'll the last part won't be so hard hurtful hey it's it's you know we want victory we want to disarm the enemy but the only way you can do it is disarm your flesh that's the only way that's that's what the instructions were in the whole bible but it's it's really hid from the wise and prudent you can only go around so long doing your own will and then come to church and say i need the devil cast out of this certain situation look we're in a walk every day we have a chance to destroy the devil every day in our lives and we need to do it amen romans chapter 8 verse 12 therefore brethren we are debtors not to the flesh to live after the flesh for if we live after the flesh he shall die but if you do through the spirit do mortify the deeds of the body shall live through the spirit notice through the spirit for as many as are led by the spirit of god they are the sons of god for ye have not received the spirit of bondage again to fear but you have received the spirit of adoption whereby we cry abba father if you are in the spirit being led by the spirit god is leading you to mortify the deeds of your flesh it has to and i know it's scary nobody wants to die but we shouldn't fear we should not fear that's what the scripture says you have not received the spirit of bondage again to fear oh i got i got to give up my will i'm scared i don't want to do that david said yea though i walk through the valley of the shadow of death i will fear no evil for thou art with me thy rod my staff comfort me this psalm psalms 23 turn with me if you would verse one this is the psalms really about dying out to your flesh i know we use a lot to die naturally in the natural and i'm okay with that but look when you're dead you don't want the lord is my shepherd i shall not want that's what gets us in trouble it's the i want now notice he the good shepherd he maketh me to lie down so when the preaching says you need to do this don't say i don't have to do that all you're doing is bucking the shepherd because he makes us to lie down in green pastures he leadeth us besides still waters you know we just go 50 miles an hour a day go go go go come to church and we can't hardly stay awake he's putting you by still water so you can just settle down and get away from the hustle bustle of this world and connect with him amen he's trying to restore us amen he restoreth my soul he leadeth me in passive righteousness for his name's sake yea though i walk through the valley of the shadow of death so when you die out to your will you're still alive paul said yet not i but christ he lives in me i'm crucified with christ i've died to my will just like he forfeited his will did not he say if it's possible that this cup passed for me nevertheless not my will but thy will be done he walked the same path we have to do the same thing no we're not going up to a calvary but every one of us had the same choice whether we're going to die out to our flesh and live for others just like jesus did yea though i walked through the valley of the shadow of death i will fear no evil you have nothing to worry about when you've given your will over to god the devil can't touch you he can't touch you did not the prophet say he can't do nothing except he gets god's permission right is that what the prophet said but did you know when you yield to the lord the devil can do what he wants to do to a point because you've given him your free more agency look if i want to go down the street rob a bank i can do that i probably get caught because i don't know how to do it but i could go in the store and steal a candy bar come out get in my car i got a free candy bar i can do it if i want to because i have free more agency but i will pay the price of that when you yield yourself to the devil your servant his servant you become the devil can touch you when you say i want i want i want the lord is my shepherd i shall not want that's the only way you're protected you've got to understand when you are in the perfect will of god you're walking in the spirit you're totally in him the devil can't touch you but eventually he's going to take us right death is going to call is that right eventually amen but if you're not walking in christ that means you've given the devil territory to do what he wants to do now sure he's got restrictions but you're not off from the devil hurting you that's why we get in so much trouble i don't want to sticker shock you with that but it's the truth for thou art with me thy rod and thy staff they comfort me well this is down here on earth because up in heaven i don't think god will be using the rod of correction on the other side it's down here thou preparest a table before me in the presence of my enemies you're here in church god has presented a table in the presence of your enemies he's sitting right there your will is locked in your body he's given you his word but you're not afraid because you're not yielding to your will right in the presence of your enemies of your self-will of your pride of your your your selfish carnal nature god's given you his word amen think about it that you can take that word and you can try up over the enemy hallelujah we ought to be the happiest people on the planet thou anointest my head with the holy ghost and my cup runeth over i wonder i wonder who feels the holy ghost our cups should be running over amen the devil goes to church in us the only one that can kick him out is you did not you hear the prophet say hundreds of time that devil's allowed to stay there as long as you let him there you've got to say i'm wrong lord i want your way surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life and i will dwell in the house of the lord forever praise the lord thou preparest a table before me in the presence of my enemies psalms 92 verse 11 my eyes shall see my desire on my enemy how many wants to see your desire on your enemy today i want to see him dead i can't control what's happening out there in the world but i can certainly control this right here and my ears shall hear my desire of the wicked that rise up against me the righteous shall flourish like a palm tree he shall grow like a cedar in leaven those that be planted in the house of the lord shall flourish in the courts of our god praise the lord we have a chance when we come to god's house to really begin to flourish you know you can't just put water you need fertilizer you need some sun you need it all to flourish amen we need to detect and disarm the greatest enemy right here how many is working i'm disarming the enemy within it ain't gonna happen on its own and it can happen with a wishful we've got to surrender to the living word of god disarm them i can do all things to christ who ser who strengtheneth me who gives me strength to overcome disarm the enemy by following the example of surrender jesus surrendered did he not became obedient he surrendered paul surrendered peter surrendered we have to surrender we surrender to the word of god amen turn with me our last scripture in revelations chapter 12 verse 9. detect disarm the greatest enemy through submitting to the word of god through humility by humbling yourselves in the sight of the lord he promised to give us victory now our opening scripture he that overcometh shall inherit all things and i will be his god and he shall be my son but we have to overcome potentially we're his but is he that endures to the end you know how many people are going to come in the last day and say lord i thought lord i thought lord i thought because they were resting on they told me i was the son i believe the scripture i believed the quote thought's all i had to do well what about the one that talks about overcoming amen revelation chapter 12 verse 9 and the great dragon was cast out the old serpent called the devil you want to cast him out amen and satan which he deceiveth the whole world he was cast out to the earth and the angels were cast out with him and i heard a loud voice saying in heaven now is come salvation strength and the kingdom of our god and the power of his christ for the accuser of our brethren is cast down which accused them before our god day and night do not let your tongue be used for a second about somebody else you're letting the enemy use you day and night i love this verse and they overcame him by the blood of the lamb by the word of their testimony and they love not their lives unto the death that is the only way you're going to overcome the devil is disarm yourself disarm your carnal nature love not your will to the death amen god bless you let's stand together i wish that this service could have been something like well i'm gonna just turn this button and the devil's gonna be out of my life [Laughter] but i'm gonna say this there would be no character because as you're denying satan in your life you're building the character of christ it's the only thing we're taking with us when we leave remember character is not a gift it is a victory when we resist satan he'll flee now i trust i believe with all my heart the next service which is destroying the enemy within it'll be more of you'll find more reasons to say hallelujah because we want to use the word of god the power of god to get him out we don't want him just disarmed we want him out we want to walk in victory amen amen without him i could do nothing without him i'd surely fail without him i would be drifting like a ship without a search jesus oh jesus do you know him today please don't turn him away [Applause] jesus oh jesus without him how lost i would be without him i would be dying without him i'd be enslaved without him would be hopeless but with jesus thank god i'm saved [Music] jesus oh jesus do you know him today please don't turn him away [Applause] jesus oh jesus without him how lost i would be [Music] amen as if you want to sing it i'll be fine so i'll ask him to be my pilot his word i compass and god till i've anchored safely in glory for without him i drift with the touch [Music] jesus oh jesus can you take a few minutes and just pray pray before we pray with you thank you without him how lost i would be [Music] amen humble thyself amen what a i'll say this i know the word is sharp but i'll tell you what it's him it's him and he's calling out to us this is our chance to respond to the word and i just want you to enter in what does god want you to do right now just ask him what do you want me to do lord and just follow it don't let this just be another church service let it be a time you meet with him and respond to what he's saying amen amen amen humble thyself oh humble yourself before your lord and king give him your heart offer your everything [Music] there's no limit on the love he has for you so humble yourself and see what god will do humble yourself and let him have his will love his word and

light of you i worship you i worship you the reason i live is to worship you i worship you i worship you the reason i live is to worship you hallelujah hallelujah oh harmony's happy to be a christian amen the thing i i love about this series for me personal testimony is expose the devil in me more than i've seen it's easy to see the devil in somebody easy to detect the wrong spirit or wrong attitude but can we see him working inside of our wants and we need it to make it and i thought if it's blessed me this much it's got to bless you because really you don't want me you want the lord any part of me of me is evil and any part of you is evil that's why jesus could say there's none good but one that's god but when we see jesus and one another that's worth praising god for amen may the lord bless you with joy and happiness and be with you triumph over your enemy keep praising the lord he inhabits the praises of his people it's okay to get the magnifying glass and take a spot as brother braham says we come here to find out where we're at but then you leave it leave it you march forward amen in victory it's really good to see brother ron husker god bless you for taking that
