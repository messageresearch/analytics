[17:56] have that Sunday so we're looking
[17:59] I
[18:00] think everybody here is a volunteer but
[18:03] uh it would be you know I wish there was
[18:05] more the whole church was here because
[18:08] it'd be nice to get some new volunteers
[18:10] to help out after service and clean up
[18:13] and do tidy up the house of the Lord but
[18:16] anyway uh whatever your hands feel good
[18:19] to do do them amen so just looking for
[18:23] that also
[18:25] uh uh let's just be in prayer for them

[36:40] to look upon Thy word and yet Lord we're
[36:44] looking to you and asking that your
[36:47] mercies would be upon us father that you
[36:49] would Prosper this little church Lord
[36:52] that you'd help us to to be a more
[36:55] healthy church that to to function in a
[36:58] way that when you look down upon us you

[37:07] and just help us to mature father we
[37:10] commit this service into your hands and
[37:12] we give you the praise and honor for all
[37:14] these things now for we ask it in Jesus
[37:17] Christ's name amen amen well uh we want
[37:22] to continue in this uh series
[37:25] functioning uh uh of a healthy uh body
[37:29] and we want to take our our scriptures
[37:32] once again from Ephesians chapter 4
[37:35] verses 15 and 16 because there's a lot
[37:39] in these these
[37:41] scriptures and if we um continue to go
[37:45] over them we would just get more and
[37:47] more out of them amen it's been about a
[37:51] month since we we started with uh or
[37:55] that we last spoke on on this but here
[37:58] it says in verse
[38:01] 15 the Paul speaking to the Ephesian
[38:04] Church age which we know was a mature
[38:10] church but speaking the truth in love
[38:14] may grow up into him in all things which
[38:18] is the head even
[38:20] Christ from whom the whole body that you
[38:23] and I fitly join together
[38:27] and compacted by that which every joint
[38:32] supplieth according to the effectual
[38:35] working in the measure of every part
[38:37] making increase of the body un the
[38:39] edifying of itself in loveen God bless
[38:43] you may be seated now if you can just
[38:45] imagine for a moment that the whole
[38:47] church would be filled there'd be
[38:48] somebody in every seat and you would be
[38:52] sitting amongst others who if when you
[38:55] look to your left
[38:57] uh that person you and that person there
[38:59] there would be a joint there when you
[39:00] look to your right that would be a joint
[39:03] there and we're connected with one
[39:05] another we're a body and we been given
[39:09] this word to to grow up and handle
[39:12] things the way that Christ would in in
[39:16] in in supplying what is needed in that
[39:18] joint with that person and so that's I I
[39:23] we all struggle at times of of having
[39:27] um good relationships or working out
[39:31] situations sometimes we struggle and we
[39:33] have a a hard time getting along and and
[39:35] making a situation be win-win in our
[39:38] homes or in our jobs or family members
[39:41] and and it's no different than here in
[39:43] church and to be honest with you if
[39:44] you're very good at working out problems
[39:46] in in in your home you're pretty good at
[39:50] working out things in a church you're
[39:52] better all you're better able to work
[39:54] out things in a church because the same
[39:57] the same um the same things that you use
[40:01] to work out problems in a home are are
[40:04] the same things that you use to work out
[40:06] problems in a
[40:07] church in other words you when you're
[40:10] working out a problem in in the home I I
[40:13] if if me being ahead I could not go to
[40:16] my my wife all the time and say you
[40:18] better listen to me I'm the head of the
[40:20] home what I say goes and I don't care
[40:23] what you got to
[40:24] say that that that wouldn't work
[40:29] right okay so that don't work in church
[40:32] just because we tell somebody the word
[40:35] we need to speak the truth in love amen
[40:39] so God has to be behind it amen so in
[40:42] part one we talked about recognizing our
[40:46] spiritual position so as brother
[40:49] brandham Tau us we've got to find oursel
[40:51] in the
[40:52] scriptures uh so one day I found myself
[40:55] in the script rure I was a sinner I was
[40:58] going to hell and I needed
[41:01] salvation and and God Justified me and
[41:04] then I I found myself in the scriptures
[41:07] again that I was justified but I I
[41:09] wasn't living a Sanctified life there
[41:12] was a lot of stuff still in my life that
[41:14] was hanging on and and bad habits and
[41:17] evil things and uh I had to I had to
[41:20] find what the answer was to help me with
[41:24] my my position that that I recognized in
[41:27] the scriptures and I needed to live a
[41:29] Sanctified light I need to start putting
[41:31] things away and I needed to start doing
[41:33] adding the right things to my life and
[41:36] and then after I became Sanctified I I I
[41:39] had to find myself in the scriptures
[41:40] again I was missing the Holy Ghost even
[41:43] though I was living a clean life I I was
[41:45] still missing the the the the the Lord
[41:49] Jesus Christ filling my heart with joy
[41:51] every day to serve him and to to give my
[41:53] life to him because I could be justified
[41:56] ifed and Sanctified and still not live
[41:59] for
[42:03] God you're you're that when you got the
[42:06] Holy Ghost when you are filled sealed
[42:08] with the Holy Ghost you are living for
[42:10] God Amen that's just just all there is
[42:12] to it so we've got to we've got to find
[42:15] oursel in the scriptures and then as we
[42:18] find ourselves in the scriptures we
[42:19] recognize that there's other people in
[42:21] the church who are in they're doing the
[42:24] same thing we're doing they're finding
[42:27] themselves in the scriptures and they're
[42:28] trying to become more like Christ and
[42:31] then we have to learn to get along with
[42:36] them we have to learn to grow and
[42:39] discern the rest of the body it and and
[42:42] not have uh thoughts of this person is a
[42:45] little bit you know
[42:48] off you we don't want thoughts like that
[42:52] if anything I'm
[42:54] off so we have a spiritual position in
[42:57] the church body now many people think of
[43:00] a spiritual position as someone who's a
[43:03] pastor or a deacon a teacher uh some
[43:06] sort of leader it's like an official
[43:09] office that's recognized by the church
[43:11] and I'm not talking that that's not a
[43:14] spiritual position that I'm talking
[43:16] about we may not all have an office in
[43:20] the church but we all have a spiritual
[43:22] position in the
[43:24] church and God has called each of us to
[43:28] spiritually edify every part of the body
[43:32] of Christ in love we just read that he
[43:36] wants us to be a spiritual
[43:39] supplier to others and to to to give a
[43:44] measure to help every person that would
[43:47] be in need and you don't got to talk to
[43:49] somebody very long you we should better
[43:51] be recognizing there's something there
[43:53] that we can help with and we just we
[43:55] walk into that
[43:56] the focus has to be turned towards
[43:59] others that's what makes a healthy body
[44:01] is when we're when we're when we're
[44:04] thinking of others so we must believe
[44:06] and we must recognize
[44:08] that that there is number one a
[44:11] spiritual position for us in the
[44:15] church and it doesn't have anything to
[44:21] do with
[44:23] us with what we want
[44:26] with what we got going on in life it has
[44:30] everything to do with what God has going
[44:34] on in the church and we're to fit into
[44:36] that
[44:38] amen so in order to recognize it we have
[44:42] to be spiritually minded we have to have
[44:45] spiritual
[44:47] eyesight and then once we recognize it
[44:50] we can begin to step into it because
[44:54] we've just read you know we're supposed
[44:56] to love one another and we're supposed
[44:58] to be connected and and and Supply well
[45:01] that's great I recognize that but but
[45:04] and now I got to step into it now I got
[45:06] to
[45:07] start doing it amen that that's a lot
[45:10] harder it takes a a lot more of the mind
[45:13] of Christ amen we just can't come into
[45:16] church at the last minute not be
[45:18] prepared and and think that you know
[45:20] we're going to spiritually be in our
[45:22] position we can't have the world hanging
[45:25] on us
[45:26] we got to spend some time in in prayer
[45:28] and and and get prepared so when we step
[45:32] into our spiritual position we're
[45:34] stepping into the realm of helping
[45:37] others don't ever forget that statement
[45:39] amen you're stepping into a realm of
[45:42] helping others you've left yourself and
[45:45] now you're stepping in to helping others
[45:48] it's not about ourselves it's not about
[45:50] edifying ourselves it's it's it's about
[45:54] others we mentioned one of the greatest
[45:56] enemies of of stepping into our position
[46:00] with
[46:01] selfishness I'm just recapping a little
[46:03] bit I hope that's okay one of the
[46:06] biggest reasons a church is not healthy
[46:09] is because of selfishness it's the same
[46:11] thing with the marriage amen you get in
[46:14] a marriage and if if one of the persons
[46:16] is is is extremely selfish it puts all
[46:19] the responsibility on the one person
[46:21] that's
[46:24] not amen
[46:26] and so it'll it'll it'll it's an at to
[46:30] me selfishness can be it's like an
[46:32] attitude
[46:34] and in other words the attitude is all
[46:37] about me all about what I want and it
[46:40] will break a marriage it'll break a
[46:41] company it'll break a church it'll break
[46:44] whatever it it it's
[46:48] around too often people walk in the
[46:52] vanity of their mind and not thinking
[46:54] about others
[46:57] selfishness and pride will blind us from
[47:00] being able to actually see nor step in
[47:03] our spiritual position because I mean
[47:05] imagine coming to church and if the
[47:07] whole thing you did was talk about
[47:09] you just for a moment think about
[47:12] that then church would become about you
[47:16] but we're a body to go ahead and ignore
[47:20] the body is to ignore
[47:23] Christ right because heaven was not made
[47:27] just for
[47:29] me heaven was made for the whole body of
[47:31] Christ amen and so we have to be more
[47:34] conscious of the whole body and that's
[47:37] that takes I believe the mind of
[47:40] Christ so we I want to read this again
[47:43] it's in Philippians chapter
[47:46] 2
[47:48] because this not only helps us in
[47:52] stepping into our our position having
[47:54] the mind of Christ about to step into it
[47:57] but it also is going to uh help us in in
[48:00] our in our in our our part three of
[48:04] caring enough about the body of Christ
[48:07] and that's really what part three is
[48:08] going to be is we have to care
[48:10] enough if if we don't care enough we're
[48:14] going to stop short so Philippians
[48:16] chapter 2 starting with verse number one
[48:19] if there be any therefore any
[48:20] consolation in Christ any comfort of
[48:22] love any Fellowship of the spirit any
[48:24] bows and mercy mercies fulfill ye my joy
[48:28] and be
[48:30] likeminded so we want to be a healthy
[48:32] Church be likeminded amen I I don't want
[48:36] you to to to believe in me liking Fords
[48:40] or or blueberry pie or or chicken
[48:44] without bones in it that's not the
[48:46] likeminded that I want or wearing ties
[48:49] or not wearing ties or nothing like that
[48:52] the what we need to be likeminded with
[48:55] was what what does the word require of
[48:57] us amen what does the word require of us
[49:00] that that being light-minded
[49:03] having look at the same
[49:07] love that means I don't want you to have
[49:09] my love and I don't want your love but
[49:13] we both want the love of God Amen
[49:16] because that will get the job done being
[49:19] of one Accord and one mind so one love
[49:23] one Accord one mind
[49:26] likeminded let nothing be done through
[49:28] Strife or vain Glory okay that that
[49:30] would not be that would not be
[49:33] Christ right that that's not the mind of
[49:36] Christ but in loneliness of Mind Let
[49:38] each person talk about the other person
[49:42] better than themselves yes so this is
[49:45] what makes a healthy
[49:47] church I just kind of if I could just
[49:49] say something for a
[49:51] moment at my work I learned a lot having
[49:57] a
[49:59] business amen and I had employees
[50:02] working for me and I still got many of
[50:05] the same employees of course we had some
[50:06] retire but one he's really like one of
[50:09] my favorites his name is David Bailey
[50:13] and uh God willing he may come here um
[50:16] and and and and visit uh maybe for this
[50:19] weekend but
[50:21] um um once in a while you know we would
[50:24] kid around with one another and I
[50:27] noticed that when there would be a a a a
[50:33] sarcastic comments going back and
[50:37] forth it would could create an
[50:39] atmosphere where eventually somebody
[50:42] gets hurt does anybody know what I'm
[50:44] talking about eventually somebody gets
[50:48] hurt but
[50:51] then we started esteeming the other
[50:55] better than
[50:57] ourself we started complimenting one
[51:00] another every time we were working on
[51:02] something every time we did something
[51:04] and you know what we just kept building
[51:06] one another up building one another up
[51:08] and the atmosphere in the in the shop
[51:10] was so much more beautiful right because
[51:14] we followed the word amen we followed
[51:17] the word it was the mind of Christ to be
[51:22] in unison you don't lose anything by
[51:24] building something somebody up
[51:27] amen you gain you gain Christ because
[51:30] Christ is is pleased with that it says
[51:33] look not every man on his own things but
[51:37] every man on the things of others
[51:40] imagine that you're coming in and
[51:41] everybody's wanting to know about you
[51:43] what's going on how can I
[51:45] help is that
[51:48] beautiful let this mind be in you which
[51:53] was also in Christ Jesus in other words
[51:55] that was the mind that was in
[51:57] Christ and so if we want a healthy
[52:00] church we have got to let this mind be
[52:02] in us personally now don't
[52:05] wait for it to happen in somebody
[52:08] else right come on don't do that don't
[52:11] wait till everybody around you has got
[52:13] the mind of Christ before you start
[52:17] trying don't do that because the devil's
[52:20] going to show you lots of
[52:22] problems lots of things amen and you
[52:26] just got to step up into your position
[52:30] and be what Christ wants you to be be
[52:32] the first one on the Block that says I'm
[52:35] gonna I'm going to have the mind of
[52:38] Christ I'm going to help uh a situation
[52:42] that nobody else would
[52:44] help amen
[52:47] amen all right who being in the form of
[52:50] God thought not robbery to be equal of
[52:52] God made himself of no reputation took
[52:54] upon him the form of a servant was made
[52:56] in the likeness of men so imagine having
[53:00] a
[53:01] conversation that your conversation
[53:03] never talks about how good you
[53:07] are that's what Christ did and he took
[53:11] upon him the form of a servant verse
[53:14] eight and being found in the fashion as
[53:16] a man he humbled himself there's there
[53:20] is the humble mind of Christ right
[53:22] there we want a healthy Church
[53:26] everybody you talk to let them see the
[53:28] humility of Christ let them see that
[53:30] humble mind because you'll recognize how
[53:33] you can help people if you
[53:35] humble and he became obedient unto death
[53:38] even the death of the cross I just love
[53:42] that that that scripture we we we need
[53:46] the mind of Christ The Humble mind of
[53:50] Christ in order to function as a healthy
[53:54] body and it needs needs to be the body
[53:56] we can't have
[54:00] favorites you can't have favorites
[54:02] that's like putting peacock
[54:04] feathers that's like trying to be a a a
[54:07] a a good show Christian at certain
[54:12] times you can't pick and choose who you
[54:14] want to
[54:15] help the mind of Christ has no respect
[54:19] of persons amen that's right if you're
[54:22] favoring certain people in the church or
[54:25] listen to this or you're
[54:27] ignoring others in the church you won't
[54:29] be able to supply every
[54:31] joint and we just read we need to supply
[54:34] every
[54:36] joint we won't be able to effectually
[54:40] work in the measure of every part
[54:42] because that's what the scripture says
[54:44] if you're pulling favorites or you're
[54:46] ignoring
[54:47] some hey how can Christ use you to help
[54:50] the whole body God doesn't want us to
[54:53] just fitly join together with a few of
[54:55] our
[54:56] friends no sir he wants us to fitly join
[55:00] together with everyone that's a healthy
[55:02] body so I want to title this this
[55:05] morning caring or this this evening
[55:07] caring enough to add to the body caring
[55:10] enough to add to the body now that seems
[55:13] like a uh like a pretty almost like a a
[55:17] harsh statement because we all feel we
[55:19] care right but you just look back at how
[55:22] many times that you you stop caring
[55:25] about a situation and you had an
[55:29] excuse well what they said what they did
[55:32] what they didn't say what they didn't
[55:34] how they ignore me how they treated me
[55:37] and it'll all boil down
[55:40] to did we care enough to help the
[55:44] body we've got to care enough to be
[55:47] like-minded to have the same love to be
[55:50] of one mind one Accord we've got to care
[55:52] enough to not let anything be done
[55:54] through
[55:55] uh Strife for vain Glory we've got to
[55:57] care enough to actually get out of
[55:59] oursel and start esteeming others better
[56:01] than oursel BR and preached a message
[56:04] convinced and then
[56:07] concerned we have to be convinced that
[56:10] what we're what we read tonight our
[56:11] opening scripture these two verses that
[56:14] this subject that we're working on
[56:15] functioning as a healthy body we need to
[56:17] be convinced that this is God's will for
[56:19] our
[56:21] lives Because unless we're convinced of
[56:23] it we will never be concerned we'll
[56:25] never grow up in Him in all
[56:28] things we've got to say this is not
[56:30] brother John's desire for the church
[56:32] we've got to say we've got to find our
[56:34] position in the scriptures that this is
[56:36] what God wants for the
[56:38] body and this is what what this this
[56:41] teaching is is
[56:43] for now spiritual maturity how many
[56:46] feels you're spiritually
[56:50] mature all right this is the John Martin
[56:54] definition spiritual maturity is
[56:56] manifested when we trust God for our
[56:59] life and our focus is on edifying others
[57:03] in love amen that's true
[57:07] maturity we don't have to worry about
[57:10] ourselves God's going to take care of us
[57:12] we just got one job to do and that's
[57:14] edify the body amen Jesus said when thou
[57:18] art converted strengthen thy brother and
[57:21] he he told Peter that when thou are
[57:23] converted when there's a spirit
[57:24] spiritual maturity there then strengthen
[57:27] thy Brethren it's not about you Peter
[57:30] it's about the
[57:31] Brethren so what does the scripture tell
[57:35] us uh what what we should do when a
[57:37] brother is overtaken in a fault
[57:39] Galatians chapter 6 he which is
[57:43] spiritual spiritual
[57:45] maturity go to them in a spirit of
[57:51] meekness you can't turn it on and off
[57:53] like a switch by the way meekness is a
[57:55] part of the Holy Ghost right
[57:59] amen and so that word meekness if you
[58:02] look it up it means gentleness and
[58:07] humility so if we're going to help
[58:11] somebody we don't got to be we don't got
[58:14] to just know the scriptures we don't
[58:16] just tell them what's right or wrong
[58:18] we've got to have a certain type of
[58:21] spirit we've got to be gentle and it
[58:24] we've got to be humble we still have to
[58:27] deal with the problem but if you don't
[58:29] have those two ingredients it's probably
[58:31] going to backfire
[58:34] right sometimes we find ourselves
[58:37] correcting problems with a wrong
[58:41] Spirit instead of a spirit of meekness
[58:43] sometimes we're using a self-righteous
[58:46] Spirit maybe we're just arrogant or and
[58:50] proud and and we know that we're right
[58:52] and and and we think because we're
[58:54] speaking speaking the
[58:56] word that it's going to correct the
[58:58] problem but the thing is it's missing
[59:00] the love right
[59:02] amen sometimes we got a sharp tongue or
[59:04] using worldly wisdom or just depending
[59:07] on our knowledge of what's right and
[59:10] wrong we've been guilty of these things
[59:12] have we
[59:13] not now here's another thing how
[59:17] sometimes we we go about correcting a
[59:19] problem we simply avoid the situation
[59:23] altogether
[59:25] we just walk away wash our hands about
[59:27] it just don't deal with
[59:31] it that's not
[59:34] healthy that that's still a sar in the
[59:40] body and that's not how healthy body
[59:44] functions well wait a wait a minute
[59:46] brother John I got just look look if I
[59:48] say something I'm going to make the
[59:51] matter
[59:52] worse come on
[59:57] is that true how many times have we
[59:59] thought that how many I've heard that
[1:00:01] many times from a lot of
[1:00:05] people yes we don't want to make the
[1:00:07] matters worse I'm total for
[1:00:13] that but we're still a ways off from
[1:00:16] spiritual
[1:00:17] maturity there's no excuse not to get
[1:00:23] mature it just shows the condition that
[1:00:26] we don't know how to deal with it and I
[1:00:28] understand that you know I wasn't
[1:00:29] brought up by Christian
[1:00:32] parents I wasn't and I was certainly not
[1:00:36] brought up this is how you handle a
[1:00:41] problem just the
[1:00:45] opposite but I do believe that God in
[1:00:48] you teaches you how to
[1:00:52] be and we need faith that God will teach
[1:00:56] us the first thing that we need I'm tell
[1:00:58] when the children of Israel they came
[1:01:00] out of Egypt and God told them to go
[1:01:01] into the the promised land what what
[1:01:04] what did they fear they feared the
[1:01:06] Giants they did not think they could do
[1:01:09] what they were asked to do by God right
[1:01:12] okay so here we are in a church we're
[1:01:13] trying to learn to function with people
[1:01:15] that don't see things the way we see
[1:01:17] them that that that are that are that
[1:01:20] are odd that are different that that
[1:01:23] we're going to maybe we want to hurt
[1:01:25] them we don't want to offend them but
[1:01:27] you know the first thing we need is we
[1:01:29] need to believe that Christ in us can do
[1:01:32] it even if we don't know how we need to
[1:01:36] have faith that Christ in us will help
[1:01:38] us amen because to me this is you know
[1:01:41] to me it don't matter what you
[1:01:44] believe it don't matter what Revelation
[1:01:46] you got if Christ cannot live through
[1:01:50] your body and handle problems what good
[1:01:52] is
[1:01:53] it yeah that's what good is what good is
[1:01:57] what you
[1:01:58] have so it's not about what you
[1:02:02] know it's about what you
[1:02:06] live now if we always feel hesitant
[1:02:09] about trying to handle a problem when
[1:02:12] are we how will we ever
[1:02:15] mature right how how will we ever get to
[1:02:18] the place that we can handle something
[1:02:19] we've got to be able to to to to walk
[1:02:23] into a situation and do our very best
[1:02:25] and when we
[1:02:27] fail I learn from the Holy Ghost what to
[1:02:30] do next
[1:02:31] time but if we don't do that if we're
[1:02:33] always staying hesitant we're you know
[1:02:35] we're we're GNA you know we're going to
[1:02:37] let you know brother Ron do it or we're
[1:02:38] going to let brother Dennis handle
[1:02:41] it how will I be able to handle anything
[1:02:47] if God puts a situation in front of me I
[1:02:50] believe God in Me can can can take care
[1:02:53] of the problem right
[1:02:55] amen amen and I'm I'm okay I'm okay with
[1:03:00] getting
[1:03:02] help but I'm not okay with getting
[1:03:05] somebody else to take care of it there's
[1:03:07] a difference there is a
[1:03:11] difference another reason we don't want
[1:03:13] to deal with things is we're just simply
[1:03:17] afraid but the answer to that is the
[1:03:21] same love am perfect love casteth out
[1:03:25] all
[1:03:26] fear when you're so full of the love of
[1:03:29] God you're not scared about getting your
[1:03:32] hands
[1:03:35] dirty God's love is the answer to care
[1:03:39] enough to help the church body that is
[1:03:42] what we need more of the love of God
[1:03:46] Amen functioning as a healthy Church
[1:03:49] body requires spiritual Believers that
[1:03:52] are filled with the love of of God we
[1:03:55] just can't come into church somebody
[1:03:57] hurts us somebody offends us somebody
[1:03:58] does something wrong and we're all
[1:04:00] bothered about
[1:04:02] it and and and and and and we're okay
[1:04:05] being bothered about because we didn't
[1:04:07] do the wrong thing no what is required
[1:04:10] is for you to be filled with God's love
[1:04:14] because God's love has the answer amen
[1:04:17] God's love has the answer God isn't
[1:04:20] asking us to just barely get along with
[1:04:22] one another just tolerate one another
[1:04:27] just barely no he's asking us to be
[1:04:30] fitly joined together yes one mind one
[1:04:34] Accord one love amen his love my love
[1:04:39] don't do the
[1:04:40] job it's it has a limit it'll stop but
[1:04:44] God's love right will take care of all
[1:04:48] things he wants us to grow up in Him in
[1:04:52] all things all things not all things
[1:04:56] except this don't ever say I I I I can
[1:04:59] handle just about but I just can't
[1:05:01] handle don't say
[1:05:04] that believe that God wants to give you
[1:05:08] more love more wisdom am more leadership
[1:05:12] amen he wants to give you this
[1:05:15] experience he wants you to make increase
[1:05:18] of the situation bring some good
[1:05:21] resolution to bring some edification to
[1:05:24] this situation that just seems to be uh
[1:05:27] spoiled and we need a humble mind of
[1:05:31] Christ to do
[1:05:33] it spiritual maturity it requires
[1:05:36] getting our hands
[1:05:38] dirty when Jesus looked at his disciples
[1:05:41] he said you don't
[1:05:43] know you don't know what I just did by
[1:05:46] washing your
[1:05:47] feet but I'm cleaning your
[1:05:53] feet
[1:05:54] now Peter you know obviously being
[1:05:56] carnal didn't understand and without the
[1:05:59] grace of God I'd probably be in the same
[1:06:01] spot Lord wash me all
[1:06:04] over but he didn't need wash all
[1:06:07] over
[1:06:09] right but you do end up stepping into
[1:06:14] situations that are just dirty you end
[1:06:16] up
[1:06:18] making mistakes you end up falling short
[1:06:22] you end up stumbling
[1:06:24] you end up walking in areas you
[1:06:26] shouldn't walk
[1:06:30] amen and we are told by the Lord Jesus
[1:06:34] Christ to wash one another's feet
[1:06:37] amen that means to take time and help
[1:06:40] somebody that's having a a a a hard time
[1:06:44] spiritually spiritually because it's a
[1:06:47] spiritual
[1:06:49] position too much we focus on help me
[1:06:52] with this natural thing would you take
[1:06:54] any natural thing and there you can get
[1:06:57] to the spirit behind
[1:06:58] it you you you certainly
[1:07:02] can now when there's a
[1:07:05] problem if our goalto plan is to get
[1:07:08] upset or bothered or correct a person
[1:07:11] out of frustration or just default walk
[1:07:14] away we're simply not caring
[1:07:18] enough so this is this is really
[1:07:21] important for part three because if we
[1:07:23] don't get part three right we're not
[1:07:24] going to be able to do part four and
[1:07:26] part four is the
[1:07:29] actual functioning in a healthy way but
[1:07:33] if we don't have enough love behind it
[1:07:35] if we got all these excuses of why we're
[1:07:37] not going to move forward with
[1:07:41] it we're going to miss we need to shift
[1:07:44] our Focus to loving one another more to
[1:07:49] loving the whole body to edifying the
[1:07:50] whole body to care enough to help don't
[1:07:54] just saywell I'll care as long as they
[1:07:56] don't do
[1:08:00] this whatever it takes the love of God
[1:08:04] Has No
[1:08:06] Limit right it endures all
[1:08:09] things it believes all
[1:08:12] things it it's forever it's Eternal it
[1:08:15] doesn't stop it doesn't quit amen and
[1:08:18] that's why we need his love when we're
[1:08:21] trying to function with one another in
[1:08:24] the body of
[1:08:27] Christ spiritual maturity isn't just for
[1:08:30] you and your
[1:08:34] family Amen Brother John I didn't hear
[1:08:36] any amen so I wanted to say that you
[1:08:38] know it's about edifying the body of
[1:08:42] Christ in love you see we have a
[1:08:44] spiritual family here amen you know why
[1:08:47] would you care so much about your
[1:08:48] natural family and you didn't care about
[1:08:50] your spiritual family
[1:08:52] right
[1:08:55] we need to supply every
[1:08:58] joint in the spiritual family with what
[1:09:02] it needs so we got to turn our focus on
[1:09:04] what what do others need that's why I
[1:09:07] say it's a spiritual position it isn't
[1:09:09] somebody for who's who's not spiritual
[1:09:12] this is going to go over the top of
[1:09:13] their head this is going to be like I
[1:09:15] I'm not there
[1:09:21] yet we need to grow up that's what the
[1:09:24] scripture we read it today tonight we
[1:09:26] need to grow up in Him in all things
[1:09:29] don't pick and choose what you
[1:09:32] want let's just just say Lord you would
[1:09:35] not put anything on me that I couldn't
[1:09:37] bear just stay with the scriptures but
[1:09:40] with he'll make a way for us amen amen
[1:09:44] Lord if our focus is just on us and our
[1:09:47] family I'll say it like this it's wrong
[1:09:50] God has given us a body and we have a
[1:09:52] responsibility to to help God's body
[1:09:55] every single one of us it's a spiritual
[1:09:58] family when we ignore our responsibility
[1:10:01] you know what we're
[1:10:03] doing we're working
[1:10:05] iniquity his brother brandham simply
[1:10:07] taught us iniquity was not doing the
[1:10:09] things that you know you should be doing
[1:10:11] right wow just by simply ignoring
[1:10:14] helping one another is working iniquity
[1:10:17] think about this and Jesus said and
[1:10:20] because iniquity would abound the love
[1:10:22] of many shall wax
[1:10:28] cold the more and more you ignore doing
[1:10:31] the simple things that God has been
[1:10:33] asking you to do the more and more
[1:10:35] you're just going to be in love with
[1:10:39] yourself iniquity starts off with being
[1:10:42] selfish and ends up with losing love for
[1:10:49] others hate as we talked about is on a
[1:10:52] rise in the the world today we know that
[1:10:56] love is
[1:10:57] waxing cold yes but I want to say that
[1:11:02] that that Spirit out there in the world
[1:11:04] is having an effect on Church
[1:11:08] natural on Church
[1:11:11] natural and you know Church natural is
[1:11:16] inside of a building that's Church
[1:11:18] spiritual we know that so you see
[1:11:22] there's an intermingling
[1:11:26] of hate trying to come
[1:11:29] in through church natural but I'll tell
[1:11:32] you Church spiritual won't bite into it
[1:11:36] right no why because they are of another
[1:11:40] Spirit like Joshua and Caleb were they
[1:11:42] were of another Spirit it it's it's not
[1:11:45] a matter of of of of reasoning it's just
[1:11:50] it's not right to begin with we just
[1:11:52] don't hate one another we love one
[1:11:54] another
[1:11:59] regardless so when so many does
[1:12:01] something wrong we have a choice to make
[1:12:03] WEA
[1:12:04] carnally well that was wrong shouldn't
[1:12:07] have done it get upset murmur and even
[1:12:11] complain have you ever murmured and
[1:12:13] complained because somebody did
[1:12:15] something
[1:12:19] wrong well God has allowed that in the
[1:12:21] church but he doesn't allow allow the
[1:12:24] mistakes in the church for us to murmur
[1:12:25] and
[1:12:28] complain amen he allows them so we can
[1:12:32] react in a correct
[1:12:35] way you know if everything had to be
[1:12:37] perfect then we wouldn't need to be
[1:12:39] longsuffering patient forbearing one
[1:12:41] another right we wouldn't have to be
[1:12:45] patient because we'd be in a perfect
[1:12:48] church but there is no perfect
[1:12:51] Church the only thing that's perfect
[1:12:54] is the Believers who submit themselves
[1:12:56] to the word of God and do what God wants
[1:12:59] them to do then the perfect God Lives to
[1:13:02] them and manifest
[1:13:04] right so amen but you to get a group of
[1:13:09] Believers to do that perfectly it don't
[1:13:12] exist but what we can do is humble
[1:13:14] oursel and start pressing towards that
[1:13:16] Mark recognize our position
[1:13:19] amen so we can react in a more spiritual
[1:13:24] way pray for them am to recognize that
[1:13:29] there's a need there and and maybe since
[1:13:32] I see the need God's calling me to go
[1:13:35] help this
[1:13:37] person but I don't know what to say to
[1:13:40] them because you know that was like
[1:13:42] really rude what they did to
[1:13:44] me how about just go up to them and say
[1:13:47] I love you I just want to say a word of
[1:13:48] prayer with
[1:13:51] you we don't got to Di knows
[1:13:55] everything maybe we could just say hey
[1:13:57] look I maybe I offended you maybe I did
[1:13:59] something I'm sorry look we don't maybe
[1:14:02] see eye to eye but hey right now I want
[1:14:04] to see heart to heart I want I want
[1:14:06] Christ to be here amen I want to
[1:14:09] maintain the right spirit and I want to
[1:14:11] maintain his Spirit until he brings us
[1:14:14] into the truth of the situation right
[1:14:17] don't wait till you you know see
[1:14:20] everything perfect with somebody before
[1:14:22] you have the right
[1:14:26] spirit amen so if we want to function as
[1:14:30] better function better as a healthy body
[1:14:34] we need to care just like Jesus
[1:14:38] cares no different love one another more
[1:14:42] live for one another pray for one
[1:14:44] another lay down our
[1:14:46] lives lay down our
[1:14:48] pride lay down our self our arrogancy
[1:14:52] our self selfishness or hypocrisy and be
[1:14:55] clothed with humility this will help us
[1:14:58] when we're dealing with problems you
[1:15:00] know sometimes it's just be honest we're
[1:15:02] struggling to know what to do and I'm
[1:15:04] going to tell you
[1:15:06] why it's because the spirit that's on
[1:15:08] you is it of
[1:15:18] Christ I'll tell you the spirit that was
[1:15:20] on
[1:15:21] David didn't have it all all figured out
[1:15:25] you know he didn't have some vision of
[1:15:27] how he was going to take care of Goliath
[1:15:29] when he was back taking care of the
[1:15:31] sheep for his
[1:15:33] daddy he didn't even know what was
[1:15:35] happening what was going on who is this
[1:15:37] guy why is he acting this way against
[1:15:39] the church sometimes there's spirits
[1:15:41] that come and they attack but what we
[1:15:43] need is a faith to rise up in our hearts
[1:15:47] to start dealing with
[1:15:50] things instead of saying well that's not
[1:15:52] my business it's not mine okay okay okay
[1:15:56] it's not yours so you're part of the
[1:15:58] body of Christ but it's not your
[1:16:04] responsibility so you don't have to
[1:16:06] fitly join it you don't have to supply
[1:16:08] you don't have to edify in love you
[1:16:11] don't have to grow up in all things see
[1:16:14] see how crooked the devil gets and we we
[1:16:17] become scared about just caring about
[1:16:20] one another and look us that are older
[1:16:23] understand that those that are younger
[1:16:24] than us have much more years to live
[1:16:28] before they get our wisdom before they
[1:16:30] get our
[1:16:32] experience the older sisters are to
[1:16:35] teach the younger
[1:16:37] sisters that's right come on now I mean
[1:16:40] we're talking about learning how to
[1:16:41] function
[1:16:45] together us Brothers got to got to step
[1:16:49] in we need to come to church with a mind
[1:16:53] mindset of caring more for
[1:16:55] others just I'm coming to church for for
[1:16:57] others I'm just not used to this I'm
[1:17:00] barely making a church because I got I
[1:17:01] know I should be there no get rid of
[1:17:03] that I I I I I have a I have a position
[1:17:06] I have a post of Duty I have a I have a
[1:17:09] reason why I'm coming there and I want
[1:17:11] to help
[1:17:12] somebody
[1:17:14] amen love is the one ingredient that
[1:17:16] will edify every
[1:17:19] situation that one thing do you know the
[1:17:22] Bible says love love covers a multitude
[1:17:24] of sin amen you know love just doesn't
[1:17:28] cover your sin right it covers your
[1:17:31] sister's sin your brother's sin it
[1:17:34] covers
[1:17:35] everybody's yes and and it to me it's an
[1:17:39] honor that God would live through me to
[1:17:42] cover somebody else's
[1:17:44] sin that's an
[1:17:48] honor because I know some God has lived
[1:17:52] through somebody else to cover my
[1:17:55] sin come
[1:17:57] on you know the Bible says if we don't
[1:18:00] forgive one another he's not going to
[1:18:02] forgive us it's an honor to let God come
[1:18:06] through us and live a life of Love
[1:18:09] towards others not judging whether
[1:18:12] somebody's worthy of it or not worthy of
[1:18:14] it who is
[1:18:16] worthy no one's worthy of God's love no
[1:18:20] one's worthy of God Amen
[1:18:24] only time we might be thinking that
[1:18:26] somebody is worthy or unworthy is
[1:18:28] because we're sitting in the Judgment
[1:18:29] seat comparing them with ourselves
[1:18:33] yes the Bible says charity suffereth
[1:18:37] long this is why we need the love of God
[1:18:39] and is kind it envieth not it vaunteth
[1:18:43] not itself is not puffed up it doesn't
[1:18:46] behave itself unseemingly it seeketh not
[1:18:49] her own and it's not easily provoked and
[1:18:52] it does doesn't think
[1:18:54] evil if we just humble ourselves I'm
[1:18:56] sure we could find our we could find
[1:18:59] where we've missed a little bit in this
[1:19:01] scripture right
[1:19:03] here so when we have more of God's love
[1:19:06] we'll automatically be caring more about
[1:19:08] the body so I I'm thankful for the love
[1:19:11] that we have but how many wants more of
[1:19:13] God's love and then when that comes in
[1:19:15] when we invite it in we say God fill me
[1:19:17] with your love we would just
[1:19:18] automatically start caring more about
[1:19:20] others now God doesn't battle
[1:19:25] selfishness a amen amen okay because we
[1:19:28] want to keep going here God does not
[1:19:31] battle selfishness for God so loved the
[1:19:33] world that he gave amen he owns
[1:19:36] everything everything was made by him
[1:19:38] for him but you know he's not
[1:19:41] selfish Heaven is his throne Earth is
[1:19:44] his foot to what house will you build
[1:19:46] him he's a great God but he doesn't
[1:19:48] battle
[1:19:51] selfishness now one way to battle
[1:19:53] selfishness in our life is to be more
[1:19:56] thankful for what we
[1:20:00] have God does not need to go build some
[1:20:03] more things and some planets and some
[1:20:05] stars and to do all this
[1:20:10] stuff he already has everything yes and
[1:20:15] when we are thankful for what we
[1:20:19] have we won't battle
[1:20:21] selfishness
[1:20:23] the Bible says godliness with
[1:20:25] contentment is great gain yes and a
[1:20:28] Believer can become so grateful and so
[1:20:31] thankful for what they already have that
[1:20:35] they could actually live not feeling
[1:20:38] like they need anything
[1:20:41] else when you have when you're satisfied
[1:20:44] when you're content with what you have
[1:20:46] your life now is more open to be lived
[1:20:49] for others right Amen to help others
[1:20:52] Amen to care for
[1:20:55] others see
[1:20:59] selfishness it's a horrible thing yes
[1:21:03] horrible
[1:21:05] thing to
[1:21:07] me people who are selfish it's like
[1:21:10] they're not free from
[1:21:13] themselves and you and and when you when
[1:21:16] they get what they
[1:21:18] want it's not it's just a matter of time
[1:21:20] they're wanting more the the Bible says
[1:21:23] the eye is not satisfied with with
[1:21:25] seeing the ear with hearing am I no no
[1:21:29] let's see what I'm quoting this wrong
[1:21:30] but I do know this that the flesh is
[1:21:32] Never Satisfied am it just not it's
[1:21:36] always want more right and so we must
[1:21:40] just be more thankful the answer is just
[1:21:43] be more thankful be content with you be
[1:21:46] more thankful be grateful always
[1:21:49] praising God for what you have amen amen
[1:21:53] let our hearts be filled to the brim so
[1:21:56] much with gratitude that we just feel in
[1:21:59] debt to God more that's right be
[1:22:03] gratefully
[1:22:06] content turn with me if you would to
[1:22:08] First John chapter 3:1 16 we have to I
[1:22:11] want to at least get two more three more
[1:22:13] scriptures
[1:22:17] here be so in love with God that you
[1:22:21] want to give
[1:22:23] to his body you know you remember
[1:22:26] brother Brandon said this statement he
[1:22:28] saidif you ever want to do something for
[1:22:31] me do it for my children if you really
[1:22:35] want to do something for me do it for my
[1:22:37] children and I'll say like this if you
[1:22:38] want to do something for God do it for
[1:22:40] his children amen 1 John chapter 3:16
[1:22:44] Says hereby perceive we the love of God
[1:22:47] because he laid down his life for us we
[1:22:50] ought to lay down our lives for the
[1:22:52] Brethren
[1:22:58] amen and this is just a natural thing
[1:23:00] but I want to read it for whosoever hath
[1:23:02] this world's good and seeth his brother
[1:23:05] have need and shutteth up his bowels of
[1:23:08] compassion from him how dwelleth the
[1:23:13] love of God in
[1:23:14] him my little children let us not love
[1:23:18] in word neither in tongue but let's do
[1:23:20] it in deed and in truth amen amen be so
[1:23:25] filled with thankfulness that you're
[1:23:27] you're
[1:23:29] content you're content and now you you
[1:23:31] can spend your life trying to help other
[1:23:35] people don't get so busy that you can't
[1:23:37] help other people amen don't look on
[1:23:40] your your own things be so content that
[1:23:43] you don't have to look on your own
[1:23:44] things amen now you can start looking
[1:23:47] and trying to help somebody that isn't
[1:23:48] as spiritual as you
[1:23:50] are come on because to me I don't care
[1:23:53] if you got $1 or you got $10 million you
[1:23:57] can't be content but I'll say this it's
[1:24:00] harder to be content with 10
[1:24:03] million the more money you got the
[1:24:06] harder it
[1:24:08] is because now you got more things that
[1:24:11] are that Satan can use to get you going
[1:24:16] away I'm telling you just godliness with
[1:24:19] contentment it's the great that's great
[1:24:21] yes all right Colossians chapter
[1:24:30] 3 Colossians chapter 3 verse number 12
[1:24:33] put on therefore as the elect of God
[1:24:37] holy and beloved bows of Mercy okay so I
[1:24:43] know we're in the church this person
[1:24:45] hurt you this person Did You Wrong this
[1:24:48] person but now you as the elect of God
[1:24:52] than they may not be the elect of God
[1:24:53] but you as the elect of God holy and
[1:24:56] beloved put on bows of Mercy kindness
[1:25:01] humbleness of Mind meekness
[1:25:04] longsuffering forbearing one another
[1:25:07] forgiving one another If any man have a
[1:25:10] quarrel against any even as Christ
[1:25:13] forgave you so also do ye yes well they
[1:25:18] didn't say sorry yet that's not what the
[1:25:20] Bible
[1:25:21] says
[1:25:22] they may never say sorry you still have
[1:25:25] a
[1:25:27] responsibility I would not want anybody
[1:25:29] to miss Heaven because I didn't want to
[1:25:31] forgive them that's right that would be
[1:25:35] horrible
[1:25:37] yes and I don't want I don't want to be
[1:25:40] there before the Lord and the Lord said
[1:25:42] you know I'm not forgiving you of your
[1:25:43] sins because you didn't forgive
[1:25:46] ABCD of their sins that's
[1:25:50] right that's right so we're talking
[1:25:53] about functioning as a healthy body

[1:25:59] to either be forbearing or
[1:26:02] snap come on Amen and and and and the

[1:26:30] all right look at verse 14 and above all
[1:26:32] things put on love
[1:26:36] right which is the bond of
[1:26:39] perfectness amen and let the peace of
[1:26:41] God ruin your heart yes in other words
[1:26:44] don't be bothered about things that
[1:26:47] others are doing or have done or haven't
