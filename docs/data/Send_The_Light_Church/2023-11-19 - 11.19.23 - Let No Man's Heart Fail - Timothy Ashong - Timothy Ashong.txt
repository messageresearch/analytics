Lord I woke up this morning with a like a different feeling it was a feeling that I didn't have to get up and study and I'll tell you you haven't had that feeling it's it's a good feeling um but you know what I I I tripled my prayer time tripled my prayer time because I I felt my heart that I have a better chance of receiving from the Lord and uh what a what a blessing it is to be able to come to church and receive it really really is and uh I'm thankful that God has given us a fivefold Ministry to receive and we could come here we don't have to second guess whether what we're hearing is the truth we can we can uh anchor our soul to that and the Very the very word that we're hearing is the very word that is going to materialize in our life and get us out of here so it's really important it's really really really important we have received salvation many of us have received sanctification receive the baptism of the Holy Ghost but that word has to become materialized and uh that's why we're pressing in amen I think brother Johnson has testimony so we're going to let him brother we we're so happy this morning to get to hear Brother TK I met brother TK in Gana the first trip I ever took and he's been a faithful brother he loves the Lord in fact when he was he was not the pastor but he entertained me while I was there and I've always just love my brother I know he'll have a good report to give us this morning and I want to thank the church for praying when I was in the hospital I appreciate that the Lord has touched me but I still need a little more amen so God bless all of you and I'm glad to have a pastor like brother John Martin I I appreciate him and his faithfulness to give us the word of the Lord God bless you all amen we appreciate that brother Johnson well let's

Thanksgiving amen God bless you and uh before we SE let's read a portion of the scripture and reading from uh first Samuel first book of Samuel chapter 17 and I want to thank the pastor again John for this opportunity giv me to be here to Fellowship together with the Brethren God bless you my brother and God bless bless you for coming to church this morning 1st Samuel chapter 17 let's read from verse 31 and when the words were heard which David spake they rehearsed then before Saul and they sent for him and David said to Saul let no man's heart fail because of him thy servant will go and fight with this Philistine and so said to David Thou Art not able to go against this Philistine to fight with him for th art but a youth and he a man of war from from his Youth and David said unto Saul thy servant kept his father's sheep and there came a lion and a bear and took a lamb out of the flock and I went out after him and smoted him and delivered it out of his mouth and when he arose against me I caught him by his beard and smot him and slew him thy servant slew both The Lion and the bear and these un second signs Philistine shall be as one of them seeing he have defi the armies of the Living God David said moreover the Lord that delivered me out of the power of the lion and out of the power of the bear he will deliver me out of the hand of this Philistine and sa said unto David go and the Lord be with thee may the Lord bless the reading of his word shall we please be seated let me read one more from The Book of Romans chapter 8 Romans chapter 8 Romans [Music] 8 verse 14 and 15 for as many as are led by the spirit of God they are the sons of God for we have not received the spirit of bandage again to fear but we have received the spirit of adoption whereby we cry ABA father amen amen May the name of the Lord be praised amen so once again we are happy to be back in the house of the Lord and I'm very happy to stand here this morning and uh behind the sacred dust to encourage the people of God and I want us to speak this morning on the scripture or the verse from the book of Samuel which said let no man's heart fail let no man's heart fail and this were was a time of difficult for Israel you know Israel even as today it has been battle upon battle they've been fighting physical battles why we have been fighting spiritual battles and then the prophet of God said Israel is a type of the church and so when we see something happening in the flesh around Israel we should watch out and then when I think about the crisis they are in today then I begin to think about what cost it and then I we realize just before this problem setting in Israel the country was divided they were so much divided they were almost about to fight themselves because of misunderstanding because somebody was thinking ah what is this what is that and then they became divided and in their unguided moment the enemy Snak in am the whole world knows about Israel the security of Israel the whole world knows how Israel does not play with their security how their agent they whatever sping agents and what they are always on the alert so what happened India on guided moment brother Bram said if the devil the enemy can get us shooting at one another it takes advantage of us let me see if I can get a little something and read if the enemy can get to fight against one another divided when we get divided he gets the advantage and when we begin to shoot one another the prophet said then we are doing the work for the enemy if he can get us shooting at one another then he will relax he will sit back and he will see us fighting and this is when you look at Israel today there's never been a time in Israel for then to lose so much people in a day on that 7th of October when they have to killed over 1,00 1,400 Israeli on their own soil even in their Wars you can't kill many like that but the enemy when they got divided and they were demonstrating against in for and against and so what they should do they were not and also I think of uh you know when we become complient compeny amen many of times we come to to that spot and we think oh we have it all and we think nobody can touch us and we become self secure and when you get to that point then you are in trouble then the four we come in I pray that the Lord will help us yes to re examine our lives like he spoke to the first church and he told them remember from where thou has fallen remember thy First Love from where thou Hast fallen so my brothers and my sisters beloved in Christ we should not take anything for granted amen we should be up and be doing Hallelujah let me just read this quote the prophet said here he said have never talked like this to a group of people but in this locality here and throughout the Nations it is become now if the devil can keep us separated he's got us shooting at one another amen is God open Target and anywhere he wants to shoot and what is the use of shooting we are shooting one another see see so he can just sit back and relax if he can get us shooting at one another then he will sit back and relax let me just give you if I have found Grace in your sight through God you take my word for this Breen if you want to be a blessing and get a blessing when a man has done you wrong and it's absolutely justly I mean he has done you wrong and you know that he's done you wrong he's done you evil don't mention that amen you take him to prayer before God Amen when somebody has done you wrong he said I mean he has done you evil don't mention that praise God you take him to God in prayer and don't take it in a way of just a selfish way or say well I'm supposed to do this but stand with your shoulder to his shoulder amen and stand in the presence of God our Father the way a prayer should be made in the presence of God and say father here is my brother and is justly he deserves punishment because he's done me evil and I I don't see why he did it take note of this the prophet said then excuse me let God go to talking to you take note let God go to talking to you when you've taken your brother or your sister or your husband or your mother or whoever has done you wrong and you have gone to God In Prayer then let God go to talking to you not to the one that has offended you good because sometime say we pray God let him see what he has done God let him repent the prophet said let God go talking to you we believe the prophet and we remember that God sent a prophet to bring us back to God's order like brother brah told us in every age when the teachers and the theologians and the people have astray they've gone astray from God's part then God sends a prophet so that the prophet will bring us back to God's order and God's principles amen not what you think or what you feel or what you want or how you want it God always gives us instructions and God tells us what he wants from us not how we want to approach God how we want to come to him or what we want to do but how he wants us to approach him amen like like in the olden days and he told them how to come to the temple he said he choose a place God choosen place of worship God's provided place of worship and he said when you are bringing in your sacrifice pass through this gate don't enter any other gate bring it through this way it's not the way you want or how you want or where you want to apply the blood but where he said the blood should be applied on your door poost and he told them how they should dress what they should do remember the word of the lord always comes to the prophet am he Tau them in this hour even how they should dress how they should eat he said eat in haste so no matter how you have been eating in the previous years or the previous days or whatever he said this time eat in haste with your shoes on and your staff in your hands and your B on be on your toes that is divine order that is divine instructions so it is not what anybody wants to do it is the order of God so remember today it is not how you want to live or how you want to behave or what I want to preach or where I want to go but where does he want me to go what does he want us to do how does he want me to be baptized what does he want us to preach and believe in this hour he would not have sent a prophet to them or to as if he had wanted us to continue in our own ways praise the Lord the prophet taught us I'm sorry that you might be say every day the prophet but that's all that I can say because I am saying what he said amen and the Bible tells that he that have hear Let Him hear what the spirit is saying to the churches and the spirit spoke through the prophet in every age God's mind God's thought what he wants comes to one man and from that one man others that have been Faithfully taught they take the same word and they give it out and that's what we are doing thank you Lord praise the Lord God told Cain and Abel when he asked him to bring offering and sacrifice to him he told them what to do when came brought the wrong one God said can't you see what your brother has done see AB see what he has done and brother BR said Cain was too proud to Humble his pride so if you have any way as we are here we are asked to examine Our Lives by the blueprint of the age because he told us as the Lord works in the midst of the golden candlesticks he examines your life my life by the blueprint which he has given so we are asked to know what has been given to us our strength lay is or lies in our knowledge of the truth and our adherence to the truth it's not enough to know Mysteries and Revelations and the angels and the Seven Seals and the Seven Thunders and the trumpet and the Mysteries it's wonderful but what are we doing with those things amen that's right because it see we pack our head with knowledge and knowledge pffs up if we have the true revelation of God in our heart it will keep us humble praise the Lord amen don't be afraid to say Amen to the word of God hallelujah because you go to your ball games you see the ball games and they watch the ball games and the prophet said they get into their spirit and they play with them they run with them they Shout with them so when we come to church let us enter into the spirit of worship Hallelujah may God help us so it behoves us when God speaks to forsake our ways no matter what we think no matter what we feel no matter who we are and what we think we are and what we think we know when God speaks we have to forsake our ways amen hallelujah so the prophet said let God go to talking to you and you will see take note of this and you will see maybe what the man what that man has been through whose man the one that has offended you the one that has wrong you maybe you will see what he might have gone through the devil has Twisted him up somewhere and cause him to do that the devil had Twisted him somewhere and caused him to buyb and slander and fight or whatever he might have done to you listening to what the prophet said the prophet said though he is absolutely wrong though he is absolutely wrong before you leave the Throne of God you you'll be feeling sorry for that man that's right though he is absolutely wrong but before you leave the Throne of God you will be feeling sorry for that one you will be simple baptizing with that brother who which brother the one that has offended you the one that has wrong you the one that have gossip about you the one that have told Li about you the one that has looked down upon you the one that have ridicul you amen and scuff at you you will be feeling sorry for him you'll be sympathizing with him and you will and when you get back down on Earth again that's after prayer you will go over to that brother and shake his hands that's the prophet of God speaking us advising us am admonishing us telling and showing us the way of victory amen showing us what will make God happy showing us how we can please the Lord am humanly speaking it's not easy to do this it takes God to do that amen well even if you don't say Amen still amen am amen amen when you get back down on Earth again you will go over to that brother and shake his hand cuz you know what he's been through you can't stand with a MTAR in the presence of God to condemn any anybody I don't believe no sir even if he is a rank sinner that's right good work and what about a brother that has made a mistake amen though I say he is wrong sometimes he is accus wrong when he's not wrong sometimes he is Accused wrong when he is not wrong there are many at times we condemn ourselves we condemn Brothers we condemn we think this fellow is wrong he might not be wrong the prophet of God said you just assumed that somebody hates you somebody doesn't like you your mind will go that way your action will be that way you will see everything that way because what you have conceived it and when you conceive you will birth you will give birth to what you conceive so if you consider a wrong thought a wrong idea or something about somebody you will see everything that way yeah that's true everybody will be speaking if that one speaks something hey oh he didn't even greet me he didn't even look at me if he look at you you say why is he looking at me he would say it if he doesn't why is he not looking human beings are terrible they are he sees me and he's laughing I don't know why and he's not laughing you say see he doesn't laugh what what what are we we find fault with everything and more so when you have an idea about somebody right it say sometimes he is Accused wrongly and it might not be wrong but once you conceive that thought you will see everything that way Lord Jesus Keep Us near The Cross and help us when you form an opinion about somebody that fellow might be as innocent as innocent can be and I oh God help us sometimes you think something about somebody and you have an idea you see the fellow and you annoyed the fellow might be innocent and you are Bing and beding yourself why should you be annoyed and as long as you keep in that condition you have been affected spiritually and physically the prophet of God said it takes more effort to frown your face than to laugh so every time you see somebody you frown your face and you are Bing within so who is killing who you are killing yourself I don't know why they don't understand me and this don't I you know what you have to pray for pray that God will help you to understand than to be understood I pray to God help me if I can understand why you don't understand me I'll will make it if you can you pray to God Lord help me to understand than to be understood if I can understand why he don't even go why he doesn't call me why he doesn't do this oh God help us right we need his grace so much so that we not just be hearers of God's word and not doers of it amen oh we need the love of God to be shared abroad in our hearts because brother Bram told us love is the strongest force it said when it is put to test he will defeat the strongest enemy amen amen and I said Jesus said we should love one another above everything and the Lord Jesus told us even love your neighbor as yourself and the Lord Jesus told us love your enemies amen and I said to people if you cannot love your wife as your wife you love her as your neighbor if you can't love her as your neighbor love as your enemy because love love your enemy love your neighbor love yourself so oh this man is too difficult oh you can't love him as your neighbor not being as your enemy so whichever way we pass love is there love yourself love your neighbor love your wife love your husband love even your enemy because Jesus the Lord told us if we do good to only those who do good to us what else do we get he a sinners do the same and the Christian the believer is asked to go the extra mile may the Lord help us saints of God and let us Stand United hallu let us stand praying for one another we will not we are we are made differently for different purposes I cannot be like you you cannot be like me if you want to be like somebody else you create confusion you will confuse yourself right amen be what God want us to be and then we can achieve God's purpose or purposes for Our Lives May God help us and as I speak again I want us to continue to pray for Israel that the Lord will help them in this time of Crisis is it the whole nation the whole the world is going against them and it will be that way but Jehovah will fight for them amen the god of Israel the only nation that is called by his name amen and he I'm the god of Israel so let us remember and pray for them and as we pray for them let us pray for one another that God will help us as is El let in this hour amen all the story of Israel has been one battle after the other and Christianity as brother told us it's not a picnic we are not in picnic we are in a battle amen and When Trials and challenges come on our way we should not be surprised as if some strange or strange thing is happening to us Peter said it can't told Jo because if you have a trial the prophet of God said you find favor with God and the prophet said God has confidence in you and God knows you will pass the test yes as he had confidence in job he has confidence in you amen may God help us so that you will not be looking down on yourself and then you keep on questioning why me why should this happen to me why shouldn't it happen to you he loves us he pakes us we belong to him we don't belong to ourselves hallelujah oh brother Bram said sometimes a witness has to suffer a little you have to suffer a little and sometime when you are going through things or challenges or difficulties is because God want to use your testimony to bless somebody we read about Job Jesus refer the trial of job but we read it and we encouraged amen we read about Daniels we read about our fathers of old yes am if these brothers or fathers of old did not go through these things what will you and I be reading and these things are written for our learning for our admonition am oh Hallelujah so let no man's heart fail whatever you'll be going through and whatever you are in don't let your heart fail he has a purpose he has a reason the try of your faith is more precious than and gold that is tried in fire am so that you can have a testimony as I stand here this morning I stand to testify to the glory of the Lord last year by this time I was very sick after I've been here to preach and I was shadowed for an operation a surgery prostrate surgery and um ah it was just difficult thing and and they have to take off the prostrate and they have to after many examinations and do this and do this and do that oh man and after that has been done surgery has been done it was 14th of November this about 19 so last week last year by this time I was I was I I could not even do move I could not do nothing I have to be cleansed I have to be washed because after the surgery there was complications I went to the hospital they asked me to do cystogram to examine if the stitches were Stitch where they Stitch whether it was completely healed I went there I lay on the table like this and all of a sudden I begin to I was trembling shaking not just the whole table was vibrating with shaking what is happening I don't know and I have to walk I went to the hospital myself and my wife went I was fine but God is good that he made this issue to happen right in the hospital before the doctors amen because where we were living oh myself and my wife were only in the house because the family that we were living with my sister and the son that we came to stay with they've left to Africa they travel and left us there in the house to Africa so the closest the closest brother that was with first has to drive 45 minutes before he can come to where we are and at this hour if this challenge I had was in the house it would have been very bad because we are strangers my wife would not know what to do what to call 911 whatever to do she might not know what to do and she will be panicking but the Lord work it out that it happened right in the hospital before the doctors and I said Satan you miss it again he miss it and right there they have to rush me to the emergency I was there for 6 days after I was discharged I came back this time I've wear ctia for 9 months I could not pee for 9 months I was wearing C even when I came here last year to preach I was wearing Ceta for 9 months I've been to the in and out of the hospital I go and come I said take it out they will take it out I will come back ah I have to run back to the hospital what is this praise the name of the Lord and I came back and at the end of the day when they even took the C C or whatever to us they took it away I have to wear Pampers because the doctor told me you've wear this thing for night months so when they take it out the urine will be coming and they have to wait at the point I could not even walk because they took the leaf noes or whatever they call it and they said the NES have been affected and I could not walk I have to use the worker to be walking I could not raise my leg to put here or bring it here when I sit in the car my wife or my my nephew they will just hold it just in pain but what am I saying to the glory of God I am standing the way I'm standing today to the glory of God I am what I am today to the glory of God I am back behind the poet again when the enemy thought he would send me to retirement compos retirement God brought me back because he has a work for me to do and he knows that I have to be here this morning and testify to you that Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever to testify to you that God is still in the healing business and is the same forever and ever he has a purpose for my life and when I was going through the trials and difficulties I only remember brother Brenham said until God has finished with you nothing can take you out of this life amen and I still believe it that until God has finished with you or any of us there is nothing no sickness no disease nothing no power no accident or gunshot can take us out of here until God has finished his purpose so let no man's heart fail don't be afraid he has not given that the spirit of fear he has given it the spirit of sons and daughters we are his sons we are his daughters he has given the spirit to cry out by father that we can go to him in confidence knowing that we are his children knowing that he brought you here for a purpose and he brought me here for a purpose let not your heart Fai amen don't let the enemy torment you with the fear of death and the fear of death no for me to live is Christ and to die is gain let no man's heart fail we are in a battle Israel fight physical battles and you and I will wrestle not against flesh and blood but against principalities against powers powers of Darkness spiritual wickedness in high places but we are not left alone he said we should put on the whole armor of God be steadfast be unmovable always abounding in the work of the Lord for faithful he see that has called us and he will do it so let no man's heart sayil because Jesus said I will not leave you and I will not forsake you amen you might be going through dark period or challenges in your life but remember there will be light at the end of the tunnel and remember he knows you'll be going through it he's mindful of that and remember he has prepared prep you for that for he will never give us one trial too much than you can bear the word of God tells us so he loves you so much he loves me so much and he knows you can stand it it was God that told Satan have you considered my servant job our trials are different because we are all different I'm different you are different every one of us we have special trials for special Grace for special testimonies so don't compare your life to anybody don't compare your family to any family because you're a peculiar family individually we are peculiar peculiar Brothers peculiar sisters amen God has fashioned Us in the way that pleases him to do what he want us to do to accomplish what he want us to accomplish so it will be unwise for you to compare your life and yourself with somebody else young men and young women oh look at this one look at this one look everybody it's it's only me it's not only you don't let the devil tell you that you are the only one going through trials it's a lie he is a big liar and don't believe that lie because he want you to pity yourself he want to frustrate you and cause you lead into depression thinking the wrong thought everybody is fine every you are the only you are not the only one tell the devil I'm not the only one and even if I'm the only one praise God for that put the devil to shame amen because he's lying God loves says and God cares for us and God is mindful for us amen his mind is full of us and he has a purpose for your life so don't be depressed let no man's heart fail because of your trials because of your challenges don't let your heart fa he is the author and the finisher of our faith he that called us will do it he that brought us here will see us through we didn't bring ourselves here he brought us here he is responsible of our journey here whatever you will have need of whatever I will have need of he has already made a way for us so let not your heart fail don't weep because the lion of the tribe of Judah has already prevailed he has overcome he has fought he has already overcome he has given us the victory oh yes sir so let not your heart be trouble let not your heart fear don't don't don't fear God don't want us to fear brother BR said he want us to believe right he was speaking to the children of Israel in the book of Deuteronomy 20 and he said them when you are face with war he said when you come to a place where there is war the 20 uh let me just I'll just read a portion of that and he tell the children of Israel Don't Be Afraid when you meet enemies that are more than you don't be afraid I thank God that today Israel and they they are more united than ever before amen they forgot about all their differences they forgot it brother BR said persecution puts the church together God knows what to do to put his people together as we are talking now they are united all the opposition leaders everybody is one their Vision now is Israel has to overcome they have to win this battle and that's all that they are thinking about one say forget about whoever whatever now the issue about Israel and Israel must win and we should forget about all the stupid foolish things around us we want to see Jesus we want Christ to be glorified this purpose the purpose for this message s to us that it will be glorified that Christ will be seen again yes that the very God of William Branham the god that used William Branham will come again and work his will in us that that very Jesus that was seen in brother BR said this is the Jesus man they look and said that's the Jesus man they say as Jesus Christ walk on the streets of Nazareth he said we saw Jesus walking in a man called William Bram on the streets of je that in your neighborhood that in your office that in your place of work they will see Jesus in you Jesus walking Jesus speaking Jesus reacting Jesus revealing himself in us as his bride wo help us the scripture said Moses speaking to them when thou goest out to battle against thy enemies and see us OES and charot and people more than thou be not afraid of them for the Lord thy God is with thee which brought thee up out of the land of Egypt the Lord thy God is with thee when you talk about God bringing them out of Egypt Paradox there's never be anything like that amen a nation to be pulled out of a Nation 2 million people plus where are they going what would they eat what would they eat what would they drink oh don't forget but the children of Israel they forgot all these things if they look into their lives alone they will see the miracle of God because how can you wear one dress for 40 years how can you wear shoe for 40 years right so the miracle was right there with them amen there was no feeble person among them and they forgot all these things and they were complaining and sometimes we had the same way we easily forget what God has done for us am if not if we don't forget we always be singing the Praises of God we always be worshiping we always be thanking God for his goodness and mercies thank you Lord oh yes we are serving a living God but look at us even you in this great country of Plenty you still be complaining you know how God will be looking at you you know how God will be looking at you in a country like this the food that is wasted in this country can feed another Nation yes amen and you will see that and you'll be complaining you know how God will be looking at you amen because God somewhere else and see people this they don't have food to eat they don't have water to drink sometime they go to church empty belly and they go with joy happiness the joy is that we are going to church some work for hours walk hours to go to church and here we are and we are complaining and we are meming and we are say we are disappointed in God Lord have mercy I've been to places even I go from my c go out to evangelize go to the V and sometimes I am ashamed of myself I see the way the situation the condition that people I said man I was driving somewhere

the devil kidnapped by the enemy captured helpless they cannot do anything they are not they are dead they they can't do anything thank God for Israel that today they can go for those that have been kidnapped we want our people back and we should have that attitude to pray those that are out our loved ones that the enemy has kidnapped and captured how can we bring them in amen may God help us amen hallelujah blessed be the name of the Lord let no man's heart fail that's right God said when we have challenges we shouldn't fail because remember I'm the one who did it for you I brought you out of bandage from the iron Finance I took you out with a mighty hand and God when he start a work he will complete it I'm happy about that brother Bram said God doesn't do halfway work right he gives total Deliverance am whatever God starts he will complete it am for salvation is of the Lord so let no man's heart fail he might be dark around you but I'm telling you there's light there at the end of the T there will be light you know when I was sick and I was couldn't do anything I said well this also shall pass this also Shall Pass amen and it has passed and I remember the scripture says and he came to pass I said this one is coming to pass he go dear ones we should not say that when we have trials or challenges then God is against us God is not against us that oh God don't love us much no he loves us the same yes he loves you the same amen and he has a purpose for your life don't be looking at this one and that one and this one no no no no no don't do that you'll be more miserable when you look at somebody oh look at this one and I see this brother and I see this one you are different and I used to tell people Peter went to jail why is he was in jail the brothers

this man they will come in contact with this man he has a purpose for your life he has a purpose of life whatever happens to us and around us the Bible tells us all things work together for good to those who love the Lord those that are called of God may the Lord help us amen hallelujah so what are we saying this morning let no man's heart fail Master Jesus is still in control whatever is

the Supreme Commander the Supreme controller oh Hallelujah he controls everything yes he's in charge of everything he knows all about us my brothers and my sisters let not your heart fail amen he has not given it the spirit to fear no no no no no so if you have a spirit of fear it's a demon it's an evil spirit it's not from God he has given us faith faith in his word to hold on to his word to trust him amen and to cast our cares on him because he cares for us Israel in the days of David there was a crisis there was a golat they fought different different battles yeah even in the days of samel they were fighting Samuel was leading them until they choose a king and the purpose of choosing a king is that so that he will leave lead them to war to lead them to war now there is War the King was afraid so sometime what you think is good for you will not be good for you that's right that's true may God help us don't compromise for peace don't Israel they thought all the West Bank they are fighting Israel gave it out for peace have they have peace they've never had peace there so when you are compromising on God's word for peace you will never get peace you'll get more troubles oh we think this is good Jesus said oh Jerusalem Jerusalem if thou has not in this thy day the things that belong to thy peace we miss it our peace lays in obedience to the word of God Amen amen Lord help us complete obedience to the word of God gives us the token God spoke to Abraham when he told him to go and sacrifice Isaac the Bible say God tested him God didn't tell him I'm testing you he didn't tell him that he just said take your son that you love go and sacrifice him and he obeyed and they have to walk they didn't drive a car they walk and they came to the place and God was watching what Abraham was going to do right amen that same God Is Watching what you are doing today whatever happens arounders The Young and the old mothers and fathers husbands and wives children and parent he's watching Lord help me not to fail not to Mur and complain that's what he had against Israel they're meming and what what he said for 10 times you have tempted me what haven't I done for you and they were asking is God Among Us at all sometime we come to this is God With Us at all I don't feel anything you will not feel anything because we are not walking by feelings and he never ask you to walk by feelings brother BR say when you walk on feelings Satan will brip you to nonsense am we walk by faith Hallelujah we walk by faith when you look around around you look here you look you will fail they choose a king and here was a king here was golad and the King could not come out and when goad comes out and speak ah they were afraid golad come out and everybody was afraid but God is merciful for his name's sake amen for his name's sake he will do it yes he raised David amen for his name sake because golad was embarrassing the army of God David said because you have spoken against the army of God you spoken against Jehovah and I thank God God always has the answer he has the answer and he is the answer he's the the all in all David was sent by his father go and see how your brothers are doing the steps of the righteous are orded of the Lorden when Jesse was sending David to go if he had known that devid was go to fight he would not have allowed it when he was sending David to go and give food to his brothers if he knew that David would go and fight he would never have sent him because no father who made that mistake no father I can you send this little boy and then he's going to no no no no no he will not allow it if you know no no no no no so God kept it with himself because God already knew what was going to happen God knew that David is the answer God knew what David will be there and David would do oh Hallelujah he knows all about us and he says David and David goes there and he just as he got there comes the golat man with his big boast and David said what is that who is that that's and everybody ran away the men of Israel were so much afraid of golad just his voice and they begin to describe golad he has 12 14 fingers or whatever six years is there and he has this elment and they were just they all the quote was about golad they quot his fingers the quot is this the qu his herment they quot and nobody quoted scripture amen nobody mentioned any verse in the Bible nobody remembered any quote of the Prophet they forgot all the prophet that has been and they were only quoting golad until even the king said this man is a man of war from his youth they forgot all that Jehovah have done they did not remember remember the opening of the Red Sea they did not remember the falling down of Jericho's walls they did not remember the Ping of the Jordan River they forgot all they forgot the Wonders and the Miracles in the wilderness they forgot the water coming out of the rock yes they forgot the manner that their fathers were eating that was the hand of Jehovah amen when we have crisis and challenges that is the time to remember God's promises they forgot and because they forgot that's why they were in that condition because they did not remember the rock that begotten them they lightly esteemed that rock but when David came there and he heard goolia speaking and he said who is that man he said hey brother we are in trouble he said for what no no no no his own Brothers came to him and said get out of here Naughty Boy too proud you think you know more than anybody David said is there not a cause shouldn't I have shouldn't I ask questions if I don't understand anything why shouldn't I ask get out from there but thank God for David he did not allow them to intimidate him he did not allow them to quench him down to water down what was boiling in him the Bible say he left them don't keep company with unbelievers anybody that will destroy your confidence in the word of God move away David move away from them I want to hear people that will encourage me people that will tell me it will be well people that will tell me that God is alive people that will tell me that Jesus is the same yesterday today and forever that no matter your condition your state God can still make a way Am David walk away oh Hallelujah he met other brother said what is it they say yeah this is a man if you kill this man hey the king will set your family free say really H I will kill this man oh I will fight this man there was something in David he has met God yes at the backside of the desert he has had an experience and when a man has me God no no matter what you do no matter the opposition he will never be afraid because regardless of the opposition he know that God is there Moses made of position but he met God at the back side of the desert before he went out and he can always remember what God told him I will be with you he remember what God did with the rod in his hands what God did when the leprosy was on his hands he remember God and God said I will go with you so when a meet a man meets God regardless of the opposition he will not run back may God help us give it that experience the backside experience where we Mee him face to face and when we Mee him face to face nobody can explain it away you tell me brother mistake so what brother BR said how can God I was trying to write something here let me see if and surely Christian friend if I was such an imposer and such an awful person how would God confirm his word by it around the world how could it happen God will never back up an error God will never back an error other brother was in the some of the meetings here there I could go back an error so it's you are too late to come and tell me that brother BR made mistake so what some of the brother BR Li so what Abraham told lied in the Bible what will you do with Abraham then David commit adultery what will you do with that amen Isaac told lie what are you talking about David killed what are you talking about forget you don't know what you are talking about Hallelujah and they said and brother Brown read books and this and oh yes Jesus also read books he went to the temple and the book of Isaiah was given to him and he read it amen so what are you going to do with it most Daniel said I understood by books what he read books oh what brother said somebody I said it I said what about Jesus when he said man shall not leave by bread alone Moses said it already Moses said man shall not live by bread alone but by every word and that's what Jesus quoted so what are you talking about

the author and the finisher of our faith brother BR said when you look at the circumstances you will fail that that's why the children of Israel failed they said look at the mountain we see the Anakin we see the jaid we see this and that and that and they failed but Joshua and calb they were looking at the promise of God and they said we are well able to take the land and brothers and sisters we are well able to take the land David said this man God will deliver him to me and I will kill him and I'll cut off his head and all the people will know there is a God in Israel stand on your god-given ground amen and that is why it is very important that every one of us go back check where it started that the angel of the Lord told Brother Bram when you have any question come back to these mountains the seven pigs he said your name is written on all of them when you have any doubt come back go back to where it happened when the enemy is look back like the budy Robinson that drag a STI on the baptism of the Holy Ghost he said hey satan any time you come I put to ride this is where it happened something happen to me and I will never be the same go back Moses back to the pillar of fire back to the back side I met him there and he told me this and Joshua can stay he told me he will be with me let no man he's more than able he's our savior he's our healer he's our provider when
