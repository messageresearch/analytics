the year that more we become more we we face more germs and we got to keep our bodies Our immune system strong um because the germs aren't going away and we just got to use use wisdom um and just keep praying for wisdom what what what to do and I believe God can help us amen let's look to the Lord in a word of prayer before we begin reading our dear heavenly father we thank you that you are here

Grieve Your Spirit this morning any thoughts Lord our our focus and our attention is upon you this morning we love you we give you praise now and and Lord throughout this service in Jesus wonderful name we pray amen amen Revelations chapter 12 starting with verse number 7even through verse 9 and there was war in heaven Michael and his angels fought against the dragon and the dragon fought and his angels and prevailed not neither were their place found anymore in heaven and the Great Dragon was cast out that old serpent called the devil and Satan uh which deceiveth the whole world and he was cast out into the Earth and his angels were cast out with him God bless you may be seated may God bless the the reading of his word today Jesus said we're in the world but we're not of the world and the Bible says the elect cannot be deceived but here in the Scripture it says the whole world is deceived so there's two two groups here i' like to title this message this morning overcoming Satan's self-willed program overcoming Satan's self-willed program now we were all birthed into his program and we need a complete nature change and only the word can do it only the word can change our nature there's nothing that we could do to save oursel or to change our nature the Bible says the law of the Lord is perfect converting the soul but we understand that not All Souls can be converted and there's a lot of people trying with self-help to help themselves and that only goes so far and the the soul is the nature of the spirit so we want to overcome Satan's self-willed nature that we were born with and we do that by receiving the word of God that's it is that simple by receiving the word of God not into our minds not into our ability to quote but into the manifestation of Our Lives amen now this morning we're going to talk a lot about the devil I hope that's okay those that are watching for the first time I don't want you to think that we're a cult but we want to talk about the devil now this up on the board here says study your Bible because Satan studies you so I want to I want to study Satan today through the Bible and I I I firmly believe if I never see Satan who he really is I'll never be able to see him who he is inside of me and and I've got to see him inside of me because I'm the only one that can overcome for me you are the only one that can overcome for you all right we're going to do a couple lengthy readings and the first one is an Isaiah 14 starting with verse 12 I didn't want you have to stand for these Isaiah 14:12 I didn't you know nobody I didn't hear any Pages moving you got to your Bible you got to because we could be putting up the wrong words here we'd never do that but it's important that we read our Bible how art thou fallen from Heaven oh Lucifer son of the morning how art thou cut down to the ground which did US weaken the Nations for thou has said in thine heart I will Ascend into heaven I will exalt my throne above the throne above the stars of God I will sit upon the Mount of the congregation in the sides of the north I will Ascend above the heights of the clouds and I will be like the most high yet Thou shalt be brought down to Hell to the sides of the pit and they that see theee shall narrowly look upon thee and consider thee saying is this the man that made earth the earth to tremble and did Shake kingdoms that made the world as a Wilderness and destroyed the cities thereof and opened not the house of his prisoners Ezekiel 28 Ezekiel 28 starting with verse number 11 want to give time for those who are trying to get there amen Ezekiel 28 starting with verse number 11 son of man take up a lamentation upon the king of Tyrus and say unto him thus sayeth the Lord God thou seal us up the sum full of wisdom and perfect in Beauty thou has been in Eden the Garden of God and every precious stone was thy covering the Sardis topz Diamond Barrel onx Jasper Sapphire emerald and the carbuncle and gold and the workmanship of thy tablets and of thy pipes was prepared in thee in the day that thou was created Thou Art the anointed cherub that coverthe set thee so thou was upon the holy mountain of God and has walked up and down in the midst of the stones of the fire thou was perfect in thy ways from the time that thou was created till iniquity was found in thee by the multitude of thy merchandise they have filled the midst of thee with violence and thou has sinned therefore I will cast thee as profane out of the Mountain of God and I will destroy thee old covering cheran from the midst of the stones of fire thine heart was lifted up because of thy Beauty thou has corrupted thy wisdom by the reason of bright of thy brightness and I will cast thee to the ground and I will lay thee upon I will lay thee before kings that they may behold thee thou has defiled thy sanctuaries by the multitude of thy iniquities by the iniquity of thy traffic therefore will I bring thee forth a fire from the midst of thee and it shall devour thee and I will bring thee to the ashes upon the Earth in the sight of all them that behold thee and they that Know Thee among the people shall be astonished at thee Thou shalt be a terror and never shall thou be anymore amen praise the Lord I'm looking forward to that day amen now the path of L Lucifer is a very crooked path he was created absolutely perfect the Bible says blameless he was a model of perfection full of wisdom and perfect in Beauty when God created a body for him to dwell in the Bible says there was no beauty that we should behold but when he created Lucifer he was absolutely perfect in Beauty Lucifer was covered with every precious stone that God created God anointed him and set him up to be the anointed cherub of that covered the holy place he was a marvelous being of power he had power he was on the holy mount with God he was the brightest among all the angels and I probably say in a number of different ways but he was one of the morning Stars he was the son of the morning the Bible says the very word Lucifer means lightbearer he was a carrier of the light and he walked up and down in the midst of the stones I I believe he walked around all the revelations of God and all the creation of God and he saw when God spoke the word that it came to pass God used him in a mighty way he was a leader he was sent on missions no doubt do you believe that do you know God has investigating angels that he sends out to carry out specific duties this day God sent the angel of Gabriel twice to Daniel once to Zachariah telling that he was going to be a a a father and and he he Gabriel even had power to close zacharias's mouth that he couldn't speak Gabriel Gabriel was sent to Mary about the birth of Jesus God sent the Angel Michael also to Daniel and he sent to engage in wars and against the powers of Satan as we read in our opening scripture he was a protector so no doubt Lucifer was an extremely powerful Angel he was an influential angel I believe God used him in a mighty way in so much that he gained the respect of the other angels that were there they all kind of like looked up to him do you believe that in the process of time Lucifer's brightness uh got to him it blinded him you know what happens when you look at the Sun so long you'll go blind and and Lucifer lost track of whose light he was carrying whose light he was bearing and he looked at how much light he had and he he he just thought that it was his own he lost track of the author of that light that's why we need to look to the author and the finisher of our faith amen it was at that time that God found iniquity in his heart he thought he entertained the thought that had never been entertained before and that thought was I could do what I wanted to do instead of what God wanted me to do it seemed at the time just a harmless thought but it was when he had that thought in his heart that was the first sin that ever took place in heaven the Bible says that his heart was lifted up because of his Beauty and he corrupted his god-given wisdom by a reason of his brightness he kept looking to himself Lucifer became so jealous of God that he said in his heart I will Ascend into heaven I will exalt the Throne of God above the stars of God I will sit I will exalt my throne above the stars of God I will sit also upon the Mount of the congregation and I will Ascend above the heights of the clouds I will be like the most high and I'll tell you when we get thoughts that we're going to you know outdo somebody you know jealousy thoughts I'm going to tell that's from the pit of Hell that is from the pit of Hell so Lucifer used his god-given influence because God gave him influence and he started conniving the other Angels who were already wowed at his abilities and through a period of time Lucifer convinced a third of the angels to follow him through iniquity he used iniquity it to get them to follow him into more iniquity so it was through iniquity he got them into iniquity into his new kingdom to a new way of living without the will of God in mind with Liberties they've never experienced before that they could do whatever they wanted to do and no longer had to stick to the strict rules that God had it was so appealing that Lucifer the Bible says drew a third of the angels with his tail I wonder how long do you think iniquity was in heaven before Lucifer was kicked out luer for filled heaven with his garbage he destroyed a perfect setting that God had in heaven he spread the fake news what was the fake news news the fake news was you don't have to listen to all of God's word you don't have to do everything that he says to do that's fake news and he stood there and he says look at me I am living proof today that you don't have to do everything that God tells you to do and you're still everything's still going to be okay he was able to convince the other Angels nothing happened to me nothing will happen to you you can do what you want to do he was dead while he was living there was war in heaven the Bible says and Michael and the archangels fought against the dragon the dragon fought against the angels and prevailed not neither was there Place found in heaven anymore and the Great Dragon was cast out that old serpent called the devil and Satan which deceiveth the whole world he was cast out into the Earth with his angels with his angels were cast out with him and his angels were cast out with him now it wasn't good enough his iniquity had to get spread he's so mad at God today he's still mad at God he's still jealous of God today his driving force to do evil is jealousy that's why we got to keep it out of our life cuz he it filled his life with violence the Bible says so Satan destroyed a perfect setting that he had in the Garden of Eden God had a perfect setting in the Garden of Eden and Satan destroyed that did he the Beast said to Eve for God doth know that in the day you eat of my idea then your eyes shall be open you shall be as God's knowing good and evil not only knowing good and evil but choosing to do your will above Gods that's what he proposed to Eve the same thing he proposed to the angels in heaven and Satan perverted and destroyed a perfect setting that was in the garden just like he perverted a perfect setting I'll say it like this destroyed a perfect setting that God had created that's why he had to get kicked out that's why the Angels had to get kicked out that followed him because God was not going to have iniquity and what did he tell uh and what did he say there he said you know we've got to put up flaming swords to keep man from coming and partaking of the tree of life because he is he is filled his life with iniquity and there had to be a separation there and today Satan is weakening the Nations today through iniquity by giving them what they want instead of what's right you want gay rights you can have it you want to change your gender go ahead you want to abort your babies go ahead you want to control the the population by killing then you go ahead and do that you want human trafficking you can have it you want fent on your streets you can have it you want Wars you can have it that is what Satan is giving the world Jesus said in the last days iniquity would abound and it's abounding whatever people want Satan would just give it to them and when they get it what happens it destroys them you want liquor it'll destroy you want porn it'll destroy you you want money it to destroy you what do you think promoted all the riots the chaos the burning of the Cities The Monuments the the Looting the defunding the police it was money money was flooded into people to get them to do that where the money come from to support ham Hamas Hamas money did that without money they couldn't get guns and Nation Rising against Nation Satan is weakening the Nations today through so many Avenues but the world doesn't recognize it's the devil the bottom line they don't they think it's the Russians China many think it's the Jews it's a Jews fault that's why they hate the Jews it's North Korea it's Iran it's the immigrants coming over the borders it's to Cel with the drugs the blacks think it's the whites the whites think it's the whoever Democrats think it's the Republicans the B Republicans think it's the Democrats you know what I'm saying here some think it's our government the FBI the CIA or the police some think it's Bill Gates George Soros come on we're living in the hour that se Satan is weakening the Nations he's perverting the world from one end to the other from the North Pole to the South Pole but the world does not recognize that it's Satan Behind these people he's influencing these people he's given them what they want as it was in the days of Noah so shall it be in the coming of the Lord as it was in the days of the lot so shall it be in the coming of the Lord nations are breaking down what else is Lucifer weakening the church Satan has perverted the Churches of God he goes to church too he tries to pervert the truth in the minds of the people second Corinthians 4:3 says but if our gospel be hid it is hid from them that are lost in whom the God of this world have blinded the minds of them which believe not the worst thing you could do is when you hear the gospel being preached when you read the Bible the worst thing you could do is question that is doubt that because as soon as you do you open the door for the devil to Blind your mind brother the Bandon said in the message a blushing prophet he says Don't Let The Devil Pat you on the shoulder and say well I go to church the devil does too he said that's right he sure did come up to God went to church up in heaven come before the Throne of God with the sons of of God sat down with them had an audience with God he said where you been walking to and fro up and down on the earth that's where I've been so the devil goes to church the devil belongs to church the devil acts like a Christian he's a deceiver and if he didn't act like a Christian and and act like a church he wouldn't be a deceiver and no man could be deceived the only thing is it it's different it its difference is as black as white now he's saying he's saying that Satan the difference between a Christian and the devil acting like a Christian is black and white it's contrary to one another he said but the Bible said and the it would be so close that it would deceive the very elect the spirit in the last days friends were here so he's given a script scripture that they're so close only the elect's going to be able to see them they're so far it's such a vast difference is black and white I wonder what that is I wonder what that is we're going to see what that is how is Satan doing this how is he defiling the church the Bible says that thou has defiled the sanctuaries by the multitude of thine iniquities by the ini ity of thy traffic well when we talk about traffic we talk about well how's 23 how was the traffic when you came to church Brother Bruce how's the traffic here how's the traffic on Leroy well you know the devil does a lot of trafficking you know what he's doing he's offering members of the church the same thing that he offered the angels in heaven you can pick a choose choose what you want to obey and you don't have to do everything I am living proof you can do what you want to do you can choose what you want to choose and that's following my way no PE the whole world is following Satan and they don't even know it anything that is not God's way is Satan's way there's no there's no God's way Satan's way and then there's John Martin's way it don't work like that there's only two ways that's why there's only one way to make it Satan is pedling his ideas that's what that word means traffic he's pedling his ideas with the church members and he's offering them what an easier way an easier way he's bartering and trading with church members a broader way an easier path and that's what it means that word traffic it means to paddle to barter to to trade he's given you something different than what the word is saying Satan is selling his lies right inside the church just like he did in heaven look the deception is not behind the pulpit I'm sorry we don't got people come in here preaching false Doctrine I'm not I'm sure it's in churches I know it is but it's not in this church but Satan is here and he's still doing his job where is he doing it in our minds why we sit here listening to the word he's doing traffic he's paddling oh you don't got to do that that's just uh just a little bit of a compromise and he he's filling the sanctuaries with iniquity even today Satan who is the epitome of evil has the power to transform himself as an angel of Light the Bible says not even recognizing it's the devil he has the ability to mix light and darkness he is the author of confusion he is the tree of knowledge of Good and Evil he knows what's good but chooses to not do it that's bad that's what evil is he that knoweth to do good and doeth it not to him it is sin today we're facing the devil who's trying to convince the church that we don't need to do all of God's will right I got the main things you know I I I I got baptized I I I come to church I I pay and that's the main thing show me a scripture in the Bible just one that says that's all you got to do or make your list of what you're doing and tell me that's all you got to do find that see but the devil he pedals his ideas inside of our minds not behind the pulpit the pulpit is preaching the word the fful ministry is delivering the word it's our minds that are choosing what we're going to do and what we're not going to do are we going to surrender all are we going to give ourselves to the Lord are we going to obey him more today than we did yesterday and the thing is look we can get so we can get our conscious is so callous that God could be speaking his word to us that wouldn't bother us one bit God don't ever let me get like that make my conscience tender the bride is living by the Revelation that they must live by every word of God where the world is picking and choosing people are not recognizing the Real Enemy right in inside the church because the Devil comes a church he's the one that's trying to get us to doubt he's the one that's trying to get us to compromise he's pedling the idea it's not that necessary to do what's being preached that's a scary thing and I wonder how many times we recognize that's a devil that's not our thought Saints you're not going to think that thought God has God has birthed you to believe the word not to question the word to believe the word so when those thoughts come you got to recognize that's just the devil we've got to defeat the Devil brother Bram said it's the greatest battle ever fought right there in her mind it's nothing but iniquity when he comes to our minds and he tries to get us to compromise just a little bit that that's not that important the main thing is this I'm telling you that's iniquity from God that is that is the that's the definition of iniquity from God the same thing that Lucifer had when he said in his heart I don't really have to do that I can come in and out of God's presence without having to listen to him I go talk to the angels and just share my ideas with them people come in the church with their own ideas right they're not fearing the Lord like Lucifer I'd rather have the fear of God take away everything that I had give me the fear of God because without it we have nothing nothing Jesus said many will come to me in that day he's defiled the sanctuaries pedling his lies then I will profess to them I never knew you depart from me what ye that work iniquity how do I work iniquity very simple not doing what God asked you to do every time we come to church God speaks to us he's a good god he's a beautiful God he'll bless us He blesses me beyond all the day that I got saved that was the first day that I recognized that he blessed me more than I deserved and every day since I have not deserved the least of His blessings not a one I Haven deserved iniquity is what has caused so many problems for all of us in our lives it will tear down and weaken us just like it does the world I'm going to give you a scripture you write it down Psalms 31:10 for my life is spent with grief and my years with sighing my strength faileth because of my iniquity and my bones are consumed I mean we want more strength from the Lord we need to get serious about obeying the word of God that we're not thinking about is that important come on on to just get into this word because this is the word we've got to recognize Satan personally trying to get up to compromise with God we must we must if we don't then we're being deceived the word is the only thing that shines light the word is a is a a light to our path and and the thing that needs to be we we all agree that this word is perfect and everything we have no questions with that we believe in the prophet we believe in the ministry here but but what we're not doing enough is is questioning ourselves am I truly lining up with everything God has told me to do or have I allowed the Le to see a spirit of lukewarmness to how to get on me it's not that big a deal I'm in need of nothing can I read some quotes brother braham's uh where would we be without the prophet in this age brother Braham said UNC sound he said but sin is attractive any way you take it sin is attractive to the human being because he's a subject of the Fallen race that we are and it's attractive Satan knows how to make it attractive he's a genius at the job and if he can't get it out there in the world Affair he brings it right into the church he comes right over onto our ground that's the reason brother and sisters we should recognize him in the mark of the beaste he says there's no middle ground either the mark of the beast or the world which is the apostate church or the Seal of God he said no remember today that every person leaving this door either leaves with the mark of God or the mark of the end the apostate Church oh you say oh brother brandom I go to church he said that don't have one thing to do with it the devil goes to church he's very religious the Bible said so he said but are you born again and now he goes to describe what that means he says does your life cope with his word does your actions does your life does your dressing does your behavior does your spirit does your faith all cope with the word of God then that shows the life is in you is living is living Christ so in other words we are not a denomination that just believes yes Jesus died for me I believe God lives in me and we just go out and live any old life we want to God has sent a prophet that said he is the same yesterday today and forever he proved it by the mighty works and now we believe that if we truly believe that we've got the holy ghost that God is in us that we will do the things that that word says for us to do and that's what we line our lives up with that's what we look at one another with that that doesn't mean we're not going to fall we're not going to slip we're not going to make mistakes but we can't have an attitude that it doesn't matter we can't have that we come to church with the fear of God God show me what I need to be doing more than I'm doing because that the righteous scarcely make it where were the ungodly and those that are not caring where are they going to end up tribulation there is a foolish version there's a wise version I hope I'm speaking to a students today wise don't be foolish we must recognize the devil's trying to get us to compromise with the word and defeat them defeat the Devil become how do you defeat them become one with the word that's the only way it isn't just saying amen it's your spirit your heart your whole being saying amen so be it that's what I want my my life that's what I'm going to seek after that's what I'm going to knock that's what I'm going to call on God for is to become the word in the message show us the father and it will suffice this brother Brandon said say get thee behind me Satan it is written The Works that I do shall you also that's how Jesus defeated Satan he never used his own power he was God manifested In the Flesh but he did use but he didn't use his power see all the gifts that was in heaven he had them in him but he never used them he just took the father's word and he said it is written Thou shalt Worship the Lord thy God and and uh thy God it is written it is written it is written it is written and he defeated Satan and the word of God will defeat Satan anywhere on any ground under any condition God's holy word so we want to defeat the Devil right here in our life we want to be free from we want to be delivered we want to be healed we want whatever we want just agree with the word say Amen to the word I'm becoming the word and that's where the victory comes amen tooo many people think they have the Holy Ghost and they fail to compare themselves with the word to make sure they got it don't you think look we're in the message but just let for a minute let's get out of the message and let's go to some some other churches who don't know the message don't you think those people in that church think they got the Holy Ghost too don't you think the preacher stands by the pope and says this is all you got to do and you got you got the Holy Ghost Inside of You so that means Satan can come here and do the same thing just because we're in the message that doesn't make us exempt from Satan coming and lying to us we've got to manifest the word and I'll tell you that's hard work I'm just going to be honest with you building a greenhouse is hard work doing things you've never done before before that's hard work I say living this word is hard work the thing that's so hard is you got to die out and let the holy ghost live in you that's hard because this flesh wants to control it wants to do what it wants to do it wants its own will brother baham said in the message Christ is revealed in his own word he says today people are so confused about the evidence of the Holy Ghost and so forth he said Satan can impersonate any kind of gift that God has but he cannot bring the word what does that mean cannot bring the word in other words I cannot live the word you cannot live the word only the Holy Ghost can live the word amen that's why the Bible says I can do all things through Christ who strengtheneth me it's through him that we live the word andan can impersonate any gift but he can impersonate but he cannot bring the word to manifestation in a life because he hates the word he hates Christ how can you hate something and love it at the same time to live it because you have to yield to it you have to love the word you have to yield to it to manifest it that's why you cannot serve two masters at one time you will hate the one and cleave to the other in the message I think of man's filter brother bam says no if you want the evidence of the Holy Ghost there it is when the soul of yours will line up with the word of God in every respect it shows you've been drawn your life through the thinking man's filter God's filter the word the word notice is that God's filter he said he is Washed by the Water of the word so so when we come to church and we hear the word and it the word is what washes us if we receive it if we don't it condemns us us we walk out feeling like well you know I didn't get nothing out of the service come on that's that's the two Spirits one is carnal looking at the word one is spiritual one is humble one is proud comes to church he's doing his job he's trying to get us to not be washed to not become with one with the word brother B went on to say when God gave Adam and Eve a filter in the Garden of Eden he said don't draw none of this in there but Satan punched a hole in it said oh it's a little bit it won't hurt just one drop through it's all it took to set death in the human race That's what Satan tries to get us to do he tries to get us just to pop a little hole while that's not that important you know oh that must be for somebody else this word you know I fear that I'm not following the word I fear that there's something I don't see that my eyes are blinded to that I get let my carnality take the the the front course and I'm going to miss something and I need him to shine the light of his holy spirit in my heart and let that word open up and let me see things clearly am in the message does God ever change his mind about his word he says people sometimes won't receive the holy ghosts un unless they speak in tongues now I believe in speaking in tongues certainly he's a good God he'll give you the desire of your heart but no matter how much you speak in tongues and deny this word you're wrong anyhow see you don't go in by speaking in tongues you go in by keeping the word that's the evidence of the Holy Ghost when you believe the word of God now to believe it is to live it in the message why do you say who do you say this is Brother bam says how can you shout speak in tongues and deny the word he said the evidence of the Holy Ghost is believing the word word always been every age if you can receive the word to receive the word you know what's scary Ron what's scary brother Marty is for me to think that I've received the word but I'm not living it and convinced that I've received it now what that ought to do to me is it all put me crying out to God for the power to live that word and I believe that's what God wants it's that personal relationship because think about it if we didn't really believe in the power of God to live the life then we could just have a a good Seminary you know we could have good [Laughter] teachers God help us s the message future home of the heavenly bridegroom and the Earthly bride brother says now that's what we was talking the other day the evidence of the Holy Ghost see the evidence of the Holy Ghost is when you can receive the word the evidence of the Holy Ghost is when we can receive the word personally receive it that will destroy the works of the devil that will destroy the works of the devil in the beginning was the word the word was with God the Word was God and the Word was made flesh and what is first John 3:8 say for this purpose the Son of God was manifested that he might destroy the works of the devil now I'll tell you I want to destroy I want to destroy this nature that I was born with that's what I want destroyed I don't care about destroying anybody else I don't care about being better than anybody else I want to destroy the ugly nature that I was born with from my mother and my father I want to be birthed with the word of God that it can live through me that I can be found pleasing in the sight of God and when that time comes that hour comes when he calls us I won't be lacking I won't have weights and shuckles on me when the time of the Rapture comes he's coming for his own he ain't coming for the intellectuals he ain't coming for the foolish virgin he's coming for those who let the word be manifested it will just destroy I believe it'll defy the gravity that the devil's keeping us down with this negativity and can't seem to to muster enough energy to live the life through the weak what's going on iniquity it's it's taking our very strength away from us the joy of the Lord is our strength God gives us joy when we follow the word he does the word of God will defeat Satan anywhere on any grounds at any time the word that's when the word is living in you now whatever you're facing that word puts Satan in its place you can't put Satan in in in his place you l have to use the name of Jesus you can't use John Martin you can't use your name can't use Paul's name can't use brother braham's name it's God is the only one that can put Satan in his place in our life and we need God inside of us don't rely on just speaking the word hold yourself self accountable until you're able to live it too often we just I know I know think about all the things that we know you Brothers you and you are some humble Brothers here we've talked in our men's meeting we know so much of the word that we just haven't lived at all so we got to go beyond what we know to make sure that we're living it every day now the world is going under there's no safety outside of the word and I'm saying that word is being manifested in you because you can't literally hold on to the Bible and make it into the Rapture that that word has to be hid in your heart David says I hide Thy word in my heart that I sin not against thee it is the only thing that will clean up our lives is the word it'll clean up our homes it'll clean up our church it it'll clean up our relationships it's when the word of God is manifested God don't care how smart I am in my home he cares how much I yield my life to him in my home manifesting this word is the only thing that will break the strongholds of iniquity Paul said to Timothy nevertheless the foundation of God stands sure having this seal the Lord knows them that are his there's a difference between his and those that are not his the ones that are deceived and not deceived the ones that are in light ones that are in darkness let everyone that nameth the name of Christ he's got a job to do what is it stand up and depart from iniquity don't just say I don't got any don't just say I got you know everybody's got iniquity yes we all got iniquity but are we all trying to depart from it and are we trying to depart from it by just coming to church or or just reading the Bible a little bit you dep you depart from it by actually departing you're going to get in your car and you're going to depart from this church you're not going to think about it you're not going to sit there and read about leaving the church you're not going to sit and talk about it to your husband to your wife about leaving the church you're actually going to get in the vehicle and you're going to leave and that's how you depart from iniquity you leave it amen you leave it leave it at the altar God's calling us to clean up our lives while the world is abounding in iniquity the bride is departing from it supernaturally amen while worldly church members are using excuses that they don't have to do all of God's will the rde is truly manifesting that word that comes in a still Small Voice to their hearts it's real James chapter 3 are you are you with me the others are you going to get with me James chapter 3:6 and the tongue the tongue is a fire what else is it a world of iniquity so is the tongue among our members that it defiles the whole body did you ever say something negative to somebody and just you know as soon as you said it you just felt oh my it it just it just it defiles you and those that are listening that it defileth the whole body and sth on fire the course of nature the very nature we were born with the nature of iniquity and is set on fire of hell what is that that's no control do what you want to do you're always right you'll prove it you'll prove it you you'll just stop talking to somebody you're GNA prove it you're going to be mean you're going to be upset set on course or Hell a fire a fire of hell I don't want to lack the fear of God the world is Satan's self-will program everything is operating through the nature of self-will 1 John chapter 2:6 if you want to write it down says for all that is in the world speaking of the world now trying to Define find it it's the lust of the flesh the lust of the eyes the pride of life is not of the father but is of the world the world is not out there the world is Desiring anything that isn't of God and our nature we were born with a nature to just want our and he's calling it The lust of the flesh the the lust of the eyes and the pride of life and he says in verse 17 the world passeth away and the lust thereof but but what but he that doeth the will of God abideth forever so you see you've got the will of man and you got the will of God the world is not out there the world we're fighting is right inside here just read James I believe uh chapter 4 the first first part of it tells about that war inside Paul talks about it in Romans chapter 7 it's a real war and to act like we don't have to worry about self-will is being filled with pride is being so full of Pride that you don't want to take a look and look the only way that we're ever going to win the only way we're going to overcome is when we humble ourselves to be honest to take a look at our will because you know we spend so much energy trying to prove one another is wrong right but how many times have you gone up to somebody and say sister brother would you help me to see what I'm doing wrong would you help me we're so full of they're wrong that's wrong he's wrong what is that God didn't make you that the word is telling us that we need to check our hearts amen check our motives you know brother Ram said that quite a bit check your motive check your objective well it's real easy I checked it my motive is good you know what you're so full of Pride you don't even know your own heart it's very deceptive it takes God to show you you got to really break down in tears and say God I really want to know if there's something evil inside of me you know we're not going to just you know sail in in the Rapture sorry we're not we're not believing that that's not how the prophet taught it I do believe you know you know here's the thing you know the prophet said that we shouldn't preach on predestination right he says it's dangerous the devil gets a hold of that and he twists it around to make us feel so predestinated that we don't got to do anything to line up with the word and that's what he does he oh that's that doesn't matter this doesn't matter God understands before you know it you know who's running the show you are that's iniquity your will is not God's will God's will is God's will your will is still your will his thoughts are higher than your thoughts his way is higher than your ways we have to subject oursel to the word that's the only way we know don't just focus on two or three things that he's spoken to you and put your whole life on that imagine imagine if all I thing I did was focus on one thing God speaking to me and say you're going to have a a business right over there when it was just a field what if I just spent my whole life focusing on that God said I'm going to have a business I'm going to business I'm going to build an Empire here he spoke to me man shall live by every word of God I've got to focus on the whole word that's what's important all right how many want to overcome we overcome by obeying the word of God which is his will and we'll be blessed John 16:33 we're just going to we're going to try to spend a few minutes on this and I pray that those of you that are wanting it to be over now will bear with me cuz really be honest with you The Best Is Yet To Come amen The Best Is Yet To Come all right John 16:33 these things I have spoken unto you that you might have peace that in me you might have peace in the world you shall have tribulation but be of good cheer I have overcome the world in order to overcome you have to have a battle now Jesus said he overcome the world he didn't blow up the world he didn't new it he didn't kill all the bad people so what is he talking about he's talking about self-will he overcame self-will do you believe that Luke 22:40 says and when Jesus had entered into the mountain now he said pray that she enter not into temptation the Temptation was not to fall asleep you know we may come on prayer meet and just say well if I can make it through an hour prayer the Temptation was now not to fall asleep the Temptation was not to cut some guy's ear off the Temptation was self-will don't enter into self-will and he was withdrawn from them about a Stones cast and he kneeled down and prayed saying father if thou be willing remove this cup from me you see self-will there self-will father if thou be willing remove this cup from me nevertheless not my will but thine be done he overcame self-will and when you can say from the bottom of your heart Lord not my will but thine be done and you mean it from the bottom of your heart you are overcoming Satan in your life be of good cheer I have overcome the world Jesus overcame self-will the Bible says he learned obedience by the things that he suffered he surrendered his self-will he humbled himself and became obedient unto death even the death of the Cross he manifested the father's word and I'll just say it like this and we can too we can too we do it through Christ the Bible says we have a high priest that can be touched with the feelings of our infirmities that's our our feebleness our our sickness in our body or our mind our our moral Frailty but was in all points tempted just like we are yet without sin be of good cheer for I have overcome the world and if I'm living in you you can be happy about it you can be happy you can be an overcomer you can tell Satan I am going to listen to the word of God and I'm going to love every word of God and I'm going to follow every word of God I'm going to put more energy into doing the word of God you don't have to sit there and be a slave to the devil anymore fill me with the Holy Ghost Lord that I might overcome my self-will I don't want to be a part of Satan's self-willed program anymore I know I was birthed into it but I've been born again I've been birthed into the word and that word is what destroys the works of the devil in my life I'm an overcomer two last scriptures that I want to read in Revelations Revelations 3:20 behold I stand at the door and I knock If any man hear my voice and open the door I will come into him and will s with him and he with me we're obviously dealing with self-will here that's what we're dealing with God is not going to break the door down of your will we have to open that door of Silence we have to let God come in yes but I'll just say like this you've got to let the will of God come in too many people say I let Jesus in my heart but they haven't let the will of Jesus in their heart he's standing at the door and wanting his will to come in you've got to open and say God I want your will I don't want just you carnally I want your will that means you really want all of God not just the D boy right we've got to let the will of Jesus in our hearts and if we do that then we've got the Overcomer how many people do you see that says yeah I got Jesus in my heart but they can't seem to overcome because I don't I don't believe they've let the the will of Jesus in their heart because when he not withhold anything from them that obey him nothing you can overcome all things right now I tell you the the thing that we need to focus on is our nature how we act when we're not in church how we act when we're by ourselves listening to the radio watching TV or in our homes talking to our spouses or our kids I'll say it like this or the thoughts that we're thinking when we're laying on our bed come on we got to overcome those things now to him that overcometh why Grant to sit with me on my throne even as I also overcame and sat down with my father in his throne be of good cheer he that have an ear let him hear with the spirit is saying to the church we have to overcome our will yeah I'll say it like this to me now I'm just being honest I'm not pointing any fingers to me I haven't overcome it every day I get up you know what I gotta do brother Ron I gotta kill that old man I don't like it when my children call me old man but what can I say the Bible calls me an old man kill the old man they don't call me old man but I am an old man all right last scripture in Revelations chap 12 verse number seven where we started out with and there was war in heaven Michael and the archangels fought against the dragon and the dragon fought against his angels and prevailed not neither was there Place found anymore in heaven now where is God dwelling right now in our hearts so just like he allowed it for a season there needs to be a battle to get rid of him in our heart remember the word that fell on the ground that had Thorns so that heart already had a desire for self-will the Bible says the the the the world the things of the world the cares of life and when he received the word he rejoiced yes praise God I love the word but because there was two things happening in his heart God will not bow to the devil he just steps out the word or the world desire desires of self-will choked out the word so there's a battle going on right now in every one of us whether we see it or not recognize it or not and we've got to take the word of God and defeat Satan and that great Dragon was cast out the old serpent called the devil and Satan which deceiveth the whole world he was cast out and his angels were cast out with him and I heard a loud voice saying in heaven now has come salvation strength and the kingdom of our God and the power of His Christ for the accuser of the Brethren he's cast down which accuse them before our God day and night if you find somebody that's always saying something negative about somebody that inspiration come from God right and they overcame him last verse in the whole service today and they overcame him by the blood of the Lamb by the word of their testimony and they love not their lives unto death they got rid of the iniquity they departed from iniquity we can't we can't go through being a Christian and maintain I'm going to do things my way we can't do the Frank Sinatra thing we got to do it God's way let's Stand Together God's way is the only way the world passeth away our desires pass away everything that we want passeth away but he that doeth the will of God abideth forever amen I love that Brother Bruce had that song I surrender all that's what we have to do is just surrender to Jesus saying got any rivers you think are uncrossable God any
