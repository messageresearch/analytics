Yes. &gt;&gt; Giving us faith that he living inside of us will also quicken us and we can be live for eternity. &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise the Lord. Good to see everyone here in the house of the Lord today. &gt;&gt; And uh I trust that you've come expecting. &gt;&gt; Certainly we all have needs, do we not? Is there is there a need that you would like to see God begin to work on and even Amen. Amen. We serve a God of reality. &gt;&gt; We do not serve a God of history or a God of future. We serve the present I am God. &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's uh stand together for the reading of the word. And uh let's before we begin reading uh let's look to God in in a word of prayer and just ask him to come in a supernatural way today. Our heavenly father, we're so grateful that you're here amongst us. You're not just someone who's uh only uh capable of helping once in a while, but you are a God that is able to do exceedingly above all that we could ask or even think. And we humbly pray that you would come and minister, Lord, to the hearts of your people here today. Perhaps those that are on the live stream. Lord, we ask that you would remember them today. Look down in their heart and see the need, the very cry, the very yearning. Lord, comfort those that need comfort. Bring peace to those that need peace. &gt;&gt; Lord, bring direction and guidance to those that need direction and guidance. Lord, may you come and just settle hearts, Lord, and draw us closer to you, heavenly father. Lord, lift us up into that, as your scripture says, into heavenly places &gt;&gt; where we could be seated with you, Lord, in that secret place of the most high, God, where we're we're just in the clft of the rock. We're not we're not bothered by the things of this world, but Lord, we're caught away with you. &gt;&gt; Come and meet with us today, Lord. bless the reading of your word and bless your commit the service in your hands and the things that you're going to do for our lives. Give you all the glory for it for we pray these things now in Jesus Christ's name. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Our first scripture reading, we got two. The first is in First Thessalonians chapter 5. First Thessalonians chapter 5. one verse there. We want to speak on a subject consecrating and rededicating our lives to God. How many has something in your life that you would like to just see overcome? Amen. Maybe just uh a certain victory or uh just a little habit that you wish wasn't there or there's some habits maybe that are not there that you'd like there maybe to be a little bit more faithful in prayer or uh being able to control your tongue or just a closer walk. And I believe that um you know, brother Brandham often rededicated his life in his walk with the Lord. So I think it's in service uh for us to do that. All right. 1 Thessalonians chapter 5 verse number 23. And the very God of peace sanctify you holy. And I pray God your whole spirit and soul and body be preserved blameless unto the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ. Amen. And then in uh St. John chapter 17, the God of peace, hallelujah, sanctify you holy. Now we are a triune being, a body, a soul, and a spirit. And we need to be preserved blameless until the coming of the Lord Jesus. And Jesus said here in St. John chapter 17 verse number 17, sanctify them through thy truth. Thy word is truth. God bless you. You may be seated. Well, in order to be blameless, the first thing that must transpire in our life, we must be born again. Amen. &gt;&gt; A new nature fit for heaven. Peter said, "Seeing you have purified your souls and obeying the truth through the spirit unto unfeigned love of the brethren, see that you love one another with a pure heart fervently." Brother Brandham said it like this. Get to the place where you can love everyone, even your enemy. &gt;&gt; But see, the the world the world says they love, but they love with a human love. They don't love with the love of God. They can't love in every condition. They can't love in every situation. They can't love unconditionally. They can't love no matter what. We know that God can. &gt;&gt; God can do that. [clears throat] And when God lives in a human being, then God can do that through them &gt;&gt; because he's the same yesterday, today, and forever. Verse 23, being born again, not of corruptible seed of of just human love now, but incorruptible by the word of God, which liveth and abideth forever. Now, here is what's going to preserve us until the coming of the Lord is the word of God. This is what is going to give us deliverance over every addiction, over every problem. This is what will give us the Holy Ghost. This is what will give us peace. This is what will give us the victory. &gt;&gt; Only God can give us to us. Jesus said, "Verily, verily, I say unto you, you must be born again, or you cannot see the kingdom of God." We must start with this experience called the new birth. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; 2 Corinthians 5:17 tells us what happens when we get the new birth. Therefore, if any man be in Christ, he is a new creature. Old things are passed away, and behold, all things have become new. Now we all can say amen. I want all things new in my life. &gt;&gt; I want to be completely full of God. I want victory on every hand. I don't want to be cow down to anything. I don't want to bow anything. I don't want to fear anything. I want Jesus Christ in my life. I don't want full victory because God does not fear anybody. &gt;&gt; And and perfect love cast out that thing. But it it ain't perfect love for anything but God. &gt;&gt; Now when you you have perfect love for God, then you can love your enemy. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; It isn't trying to muster up strength to love other people with your human love. It just can't be done. That's why we need a born again experience. &gt;&gt; All right. And ver okay. Therefore, if any man be in Christ, he's a new creature. The old things are passed away. Behold, all things have become new, and all things are of God. That's what we're trying to get to. In the message, enticing spirits, Brother Brandham says, "And so do you know that you're not right with God when you're still backbiting, lying, and doing everything?" He says, "You can't be right with God. I don't care how many churches you belong to &gt;&gt; until your soul becomes converted. &gt;&gt; See, too many people I want to say, you know, they they love God. They're out there serving God. They're born again, but they're still living like the world. They never got a nature change. Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, what we need to do is we need to be pressing to this born again experience, &gt;&gt; this complete nature change. We're all thankful for the work that God has started in us, but we must keep focused on what we're to become. &gt;&gt; And Paul said it like this in Philippians chapter 3:13. Brethren, I count not myself to have apprehended yet, but this one thing I do. I'm forgetting those things which are behind me and I'm reaching forth unto those things which I have not yet attained. &gt;&gt; I press towards the mark for the prize of the high calling of God in Christ Jesus. There's a pressing towards something that I don't have yet. And and if we're not pressing towards it, as brother Ron was saying, we're going to be drifting back, right? We're going to drift back. and and and Paul speaking to the Hebrew church in in chapter 3 or chapter 6 uh verse one. Hebrews chapter 6 verse1 he says therefore leaving the principles of the doctrine of Christ let us go onto perfection. Let us go on to perfection. Don't be satisfied with where you're at. That's right. &gt;&gt; Because God ain't satisfied with where you're at. &gt;&gt; So, you shouldn't be satisfied. &gt;&gt; Now, we know perfection means to be complete. &gt;&gt; And we're complete in Christ. &gt;&gt; But Christ needs to be complete in us. &gt;&gt; We need to be like Jesus. Jesus said in Matthew 5:48, "Be ye therefore perfect or complete as your father which is in heaven is perfect." &gt;&gt; He completely loves everybody. He doesn't just love some people when they're doing good. &gt;&gt; He loves everybody. Now, he doesn't love the sin, but he loves everybody. &gt;&gt; And there should be something inside of the believer who wants to get to the place that Jesus told them to get to. Yes, &gt;&gt; just to get perfect. And in order to do that, you got to get serious with God. More serious with God. &gt;&gt; And we've read this uh scripture many times. Romans 8:29, for whom he did forno, he did also predestinate to be conformed to the image of his son. So we I don't care how you say it, but if you're truly the bride of Christ, you have been predestinated to be in the image of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; It's predestinated. Like if I was going to say on such and such a date, it's predestinated. This is going to happen in your life. You're going to walk outside. There's going to be a car in the driveway and uh two people are going to step out of that car. They're going to walk over to your house and they're going to they're going to tell you that um you have re you have won a new washer and dryer. And if it happened, you would know it was true. &gt;&gt; That's what you predestinated for that to happen. The bride is truly predestinated to be like Jesus. &gt;&gt; But not the foolish virgin. &gt;&gt; There's I'll be honest with you, the foolish virgin, there's not even an interest. &gt;&gt; 1 John 3:1 says, "We're laying a foundation with all these scriptures. Behold, what manner of love the Father bestowed upon us that we should be called the sons of God. Therefore the world knoweth us not because it knew him not. Beloved, now are we the sons of God, and it does not yet appear what we shall be, but we know that when he shall appear, we shall be like him, for we shall see him as he is. And every man that has this hope in him. &gt;&gt; He's purifying himself. There's there's like a a continual washing going on even as he is pure. We have this one osmosis system. It's a kinetical. I don't know if anybody's got a kinetical uh osmosis KFI system, but it is the only system in the world as I understand that it has a selfcleaning uh carbon cartridge in there. And how it does the water continually, you don't have to replace the cartridge. The water continually runs over it and and gets all the impurities off of it. And so the cartridge is always being used to to keep to make the the water taste good and and and and purify the water. It's the it's the last filter that it goes through. So the water's always dripping on it and it's always uh keeping it pure. So it's purifying it. and to to to a believer who has the uh the heart that I love you God and I know my purpose is to become in your image that I am going to work on purifying myself on a regular basis. That's why I'm saying we always sitting here there should be things in our life that we'd like to see gone &gt;&gt; and we should be wanting to work on them and I believe that this service can help us really that's what it's been set aside for. The last scripture I want to read here before we we get into this is 2 Corinthians chapter 3:17. It says, "Now the Lord is that spirit, and where the spirit of the Lord is, there is liberty." &gt;&gt; But we all with open face, beholding as in a glass the glory of the Lord, we're changed into the same image from glory to glory, even as the spirit of the Lord. So I want I usually read these these scriptures together because they go uh hand inand um to become more into the image of Christ. It's not something that um it it just happens that um it it it it happens when um we give God liberty in our heart and we allow the word to really come deep down inside of us. And we want to dedicate our whole lives. And I think what happens is that people do not get they do not focus on what they really should be dedicating to the Lord. And in other words, they dedicate part of themselves to the Lord, but not their whole being. So I want to take a few moments and I want to kind of break this down. And everybody, most everybody remembers a long time ago, we made this nice little man here. &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham talked about it as three circles and uh maybe in a service and no it not. Oops. Good thing that wasn't glass, right? We'd all be like, "Ah, might have to lower that a little bit." All right. He talked about three circles. He he he describes that a human being is a triune being. He says the outside is the body and it has five gates or senses that goes into the innermost part of you. And uh and that you see him see, taste, feel, hear and smell. And then inside of that uh circle is another circle and that also has five entrances to enter into the heart. Um and that's reasoning, imagination, conscious, affection, and memory. And inside of that is the inner circle. And that only has one gate to get in and that's called freemore agency. We've talked about that. And he said there's only two things that can ever dwell inside of this and it's called faith or doubt. Now I do want to bring this to your attention. This is so strong that it's not just faith or doubt but it's faith or doubt in the word of God. This is important because if we don't realize what it takes to change our lives, it's not just faith or doubt. It's faith or doubt in the word is what changes our lives. &gt;&gt; So if we're thinking about, you know, rededicating our lives and consecrating our lives, this we need to understand what we're trying to uh achieve. So, what I did is I took these three circles and I wanted to um that's about all I can go is up to there. Can you can see those? Okay. Right. &gt;&gt; I went ahead and I just broke these circles up so we can kind of concentrate on these uh a little bit. A lot of times when somebody's got like a a bad habit, uh let's say they're looking at the wrong things on their phone or on a computer and they say, "Oh, you know, I've got to just I've got to deal with that. I got to I got to stop looking." And so they they kind of deal with this over here with their their their sight and they just or maybe they have a a a a bad imagination or their memory think keeps cropping up something from their past. Um or they're they're they're just dealing with the reasoning reasoning a lot in their in their mind. And um they they begin to try to focus on I got to stop thinking. I got to think on these things. And they they're trying to get victory over certain things in their life by doing that and not really realizing that this is where it needs to begin. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; And when brother Brandon preached the message, the majority of the messages he preached it where the the outer circle is the body, the inner circle is the soul and uh and the very smallest circle is the spirit. Now that is the way that he preaches it most of the time and he says that the the soul the is the nature of the spirit. He makes those those statements but if you go to the end of his ministry he brings out just the opposite where the spirit is the center and the the soul is the very very uh core of a human being. &gt;&gt; And so for now we're just going to go with that. But if what what you name these two really just doesn'tite quite matter to the very fact that the things that he said about them are all the same. You are you with me? &gt;&gt; Okay. So I want to read some quotes and I want to go through these quotes and kind of break some things down. Brother Brham said in the message you must be born again. He says but if you're born of God this is your father. If you're born again, this is your father. A lot of people, brother Brown has often said this, separate God from the word. &gt;&gt; You cannot separate God from the word. &gt;&gt; When you're when you're born again, this becomes your absolute. This is your father. This is who you obey. He is the word. The word. No matter how many sensations you have, &gt;&gt; still a child of Satan until you become dead to the world and alive in Christ. Listen quickly now because a lot of, you know, a lot of things happen out here in these two realms. I mean, dancing in the spirit and so many things happen in these realms and inside this is still dead. Now, &gt;&gt; that's what the prophet said. He said, "A soul, good or bad, good or bad, doesn't change it." Now, I have a lot of scripture wrote down on here on this one I want to comment in. He said, "What is a soul?" What is a soul? He says, "You are a soul." So when you're looking at these three things, I mean, if you look at me, of course, every time you you think about me, you think about probably how I act, my face, the outside part of me. And we we don't really think about who we really are. &gt;&gt; Who we really are is inside. You don't see it. I mean, look, when you go How many We've all been to a funeral. &gt;&gt; And when we're at at the funeral, you don't see that person. You see the outside shell laying there. These two things are gone. The spirit and soul is gone. But when we look at one another, we're looking at our body and our hair and things like that. But in reality, who I am is on the inside of me. a soul. That's who I am. Brother Brandham says, "The part inside of you and when you die, ever what shape that soul is in, that's the way it goes. It goes to its destination." He says, "You couldn't pull it up. No matter how much you do for it, that soul's got to be changed here. It's got to be born again here. Amen. &gt;&gt; You know, people they they get baptized and they they they they make this little commitment to God and they they do a few things and they they think they're born again, but there's no scripture for that. All the scripture is about a nature change, about all things becoming new and the old has passed away and that that becomes the biblical uh the the the biblical definition of being born again. So, it doesn't really matter what we think. And the prophet, he's just he's spelling it right out here. He says, "Say, what about the Holy Ghost?" Brother Brandham, he says, "The Holy Ghost baptizes you into the body for service, but you believe unto eternal life." Now, this is real powerful because the Holy Ghost can come and and baptize you. And it can it can it can really do a work. But here's the thing. Your journey is to believe the word for a nature change. &gt;&gt; In other words, if you're not going to believe that God's going to do this in your life, it's just not going to happen. &gt;&gt; That's why Jesus said, "If you can believe, all things are possible. He that heareth my words and believeth on me that sent me has eternal life. Then you're baptized by the Holy Spirit into the body for the manifestation of the gifts and so forth and believed to eternal life. He that believeth has eternal life. And when you believe and when you believe is when you're dead and you're born regenerated, a new creature. I love that. How many people say they believe and their life is just like the world? I mean, they're deceived. &gt;&gt; I'm so glad we got the word to tell us the true definition. &gt;&gt; The soul. Now, remember, good or bad, death doesn't have one thing to do with it. Death just takes it to its destination. &gt;&gt; He says, "You hear it? And if you still got the world and the love of the world in you, it'll die with you because the world must die." God has condemned the world and the world order. God has condemned it and has got to die. And if that world is in you, you'll die with the world. My I don't see how it could be any planer, brother. [laughter] And if it's good, born of God, it has to go to God. And if it's of the world, it'll remain perished with the world. If it's of God, it'll live with God. Educated or not, educated or literate. If the world is still there, it must die. And if the world is in your soul, if the world is in your soul, your desire is of the things of the world, you'll perish with the world. That's clear, isn't it? It should be. you're part of the dead world and the world is dead and you're dead with the world. But if you're born again and you're alive with Christ and your affections is on the things above and and and not on the things of the world. But if you're born again of the spirit of God, you're part of God and of and are eternal with him. Then death cannot touch you when you are born again. Death cannot touch you when you're born again. You are eternal. You have changed from a creature of time to a creature of eternity. You have changed from death unto life. I'm talking about eternal from eternal death to eternal life. If you're of the world, you'll die with it. The Bible says if you love the world or the things of the world, the love of the God's not even in you. You can't love the world. Jesus said you can't love God and mammon. Mammon is of the world. You can't love the world and God at the same time. He that says he loves me and keeps not my sayings, the Bible said he's a liar and the truth not even in him. Says there you are. Now that's pretty pretty strong. But um it's the truth. &gt;&gt; It's the truth. Brother Brandon says it's easy to know where you're going. Just see where you're being drawn to. What's drawing you, &gt;&gt; right? If you're being drawn to God, the word is important to you. If you're being drawn to the world, then you're you're not putting much emphasis on the word of God. Your your emphasis is on meeting all your other needs. And um God is is is calling us to have this completely changed. When this is changed, this and this will line up. &gt;&gt; Are you with me? Now, we all have uh things in our our life that we'd like to see changed. And um it's going to take faith in the word through self-will to get the doubt out to see that change in her life. If you walk into a bar, you're going to see and you're going to smell and you're going to hear and you're going to taste. Everything is going to declare that you're in a bar with your body. You come into a church, you're going to see it looks like a church. You're going to smell that it's clean like a church. [laughter] It's going to feel like a church. You're going to hear the singing. It's going to hear like a church. This is what your body is identifying. And um once these, you know, you walk into a a bar or you walk into a party, you walk into a a mall, you see things, you hear things, you you walk into a circus, and that you can the popcorn, the candy, and uh the things that are going around the circus, the animals. All of a sudden, you're these gates now are open from what you're seeing and smelling. And then you can imagine what it's like to be on the on the uh on the mira or the or the the the different rides or to see the different animals and you can begin to reason what it's like to stand on top of an elephant. Um and then um um you can um you cannot um try to become a new creature by just dealing with these. Because if you still don't if you're still doubting if you're still doubting living by God's word, in other words, you don't put the emphasis in the word of God is so important to me. It's my absolute. This is my absolute. It isn't just this is my religion. This is my church. This is what I go to. I believe in the prophet. It's not that. Your heart has to be faith in the word of God for your life. And if it's not number one, it don't matter how much we put on. &gt;&gt; No matter how we dress, it don't matter how we try to, well, I'll try to think better and I I I I'll try to set my uh my I only try to think about good things. That only lasts so long because if you still got doubt in here. So when we're talking this whole thing is when you if you really want to consecrate yourself, if you really want to dedicate yourself, you really want to become a better person, you need to focus on your heart. &gt;&gt; Your heart, your heart needs to be filled with faith in God's word. So now you come to church and it's like what's important to you is that the word is being preached that you want to hear what God is speaking to you. So you can say, "Lord, I I want to follow this. &gt;&gt; You're opening my eyes." And and you're not even thinking about this over here. &gt;&gt; Because how many people do we know they'll come and they'll dress right, but they live like the devil? &gt;&gt; Or they can they can talk right, but then all of a sudden the words start slipping out of their mouth. you you it isn't about trying to change up your words. &gt;&gt; It's about changing your heart. &gt;&gt; And it needs to BE DONE ON A REGULAR BASIS. &gt;&gt; A regular basis. Ezekiel 18:4 says, "Behold, all souls are mine. As the soul of a father, as the soul of the son is mine, the soul that sinnth shall die." We know the bodies are going to die, &gt;&gt; but we don't want our soul to die. We have a body waiting for us. &gt;&gt; This is the thing that we got to get born again. &gt;&gt; Is the is the very very heart of man. &gt;&gt; Now in our in our the spirit realm is our mind. This is our mind. This is where we do our imagining, our reasoning, our conscious, our affection, our memory. All that stuff happens in our mind and we think in our mind. But there is a distinct difference between thinking in your heart. As a man thinkketh in his heart, so is he. &gt;&gt; So there's a dividing line between these two thinking. This thinking trumps this thinking. Hebrews 4:12 says, "For the word of God is quick and powerful and sharper than any two-edged sword, piercing even to the dividing of sunder of the soul and the spirit and of the joints and the marrow and is a discerner of the thoughts and the intents of what? The spirit." See, the intents come from here. The intents come from here. God knows what our intents are. We You ever talk to somebody? &gt;&gt; You ever talk to somebody and they're saying something, but you know their intent is different than what they're saying? &gt;&gt; People have the ability to have a different intent than what they're talking. But the word of God, which is Jesus Christ, the Holy Ghost, &gt;&gt; can discern the intent. &gt;&gt; And it it knows. And the thing is, we need to realize that God knows our intentions. And then if if we're if we're not going to be true blue to the word, then it doesn't matter how much we try to be a good Christian. &gt;&gt; It it just it doesn't matter because the the this is what's got to be born again. &gt;&gt; When this becomes born again, we we naturally do the right things. &gt;&gt; We naturally do the right things. Now, I'm not saying we don't fall. We don't make mistakes, but we're not battling. We're not being rebellious. We're not battling things. We're not sitting there, I don't I don't feel like going to church. I don't I don't feel like being a good person. I just want to do my own thing. And so, the key is that we can only let God's word into our heart and soul through self-will. We've got to say, "God, I want you in my heart." &gt;&gt; And and we can say the words. We can sing the songs, &gt;&gt; BUT GOD KNOWS WHETHER WE'RE DESIRING IT or not. &gt;&gt; And here's what's beautiful about this. There's doubt in our hearts because we're not exercising faith. &gt;&gt; Jesus comes to the man and he says, "Do you believe I can do this?" And he says, "Yes, I can, but help thou my unbelief." The way to get rid of doubt is to start flooding yourself with faith in the word of God. &gt;&gt; In other words, if there's a stronghold there, &gt;&gt; start feeding your faith the word of God and watch that thing get smaller and smaller. Because if you have faith to say unto this mountain, be thou removed and cast into the sea, it'll happen. But it's not a gift. It's not a gift. Faith is not a gift. Now, there are gifts of faith, but let me just say this. I'm not talking about gifts. I'm talking about what it takes for a nature change. A gift of faith will never change the nature. This is something that has to go through self-will. And gifts are given by God are not self-willed. Gifts are without repentance. So I'm talking about if you really want to see a victory in your life, you want to be to a place where you're not murmuring, complaining, bothered, upset, you're you're you want victory, you have to self God, fill me with your word. Fill me with the living word, Lord. Let your word become alive inside of me. And you begin to build on this real relationship with God. It's not a religion. Remember, Brother Brandham said, "Religion is the bark of a tree. It's the outside. It's the way they dressed. It's the the jumping. It's it's all this outside stuff. &gt;&gt; But inside of them, their nature, &gt;&gt; that's where the life is. It's on the inside. Now we we want this dedicated to God. We want our bodies dedicated to God. Jesus said or Paul said, "Let the mind that was in Christ be in you." &gt;&gt; So we want to we want to think like God. We want to uh uh humble ourselves and and and make ourselves of no reputation. But but the thing is don't try to do that without giving your soul to God. Because now here's the thing. God owns your soul. You don't like this. How many's got their house paid off? One. I did have it paid off one time, maybe twice. It's not paid now, but it was that one time, but you know, you don't own that house. The moment you stop paying taxes, &gt;&gt; they can take it from you. &gt;&gt; It's only yours to use for a while. &gt;&gt; Your soul belongs to God. &gt;&gt; You can do what you want to do. live the life you want to live. But one day you will answer for that soul that God created. Your soul belongs to God. Now, it's important to have a right spirit in here because brother Brandon said only faith or doubt. I'll say it like this. Before you're born again, what what spirit is in here? class. Let's get involved. Yes, there's doubt, but what spirit is that? It's the devil as sure as anything. That's why we have to be born again of a different spirit. I I mean, you take a a I bet you Reese when he was born, he was probably a sweet little boy, little baby boy. He just batting his eyes and drinking the bottle and cuddling and being passed from adult to adult. And look at he's so cute. Look at those freckles. But eventually that little cute boy began to start doing some deceiving things. And all of us did. &gt;&gt; All of us did. There wasn't one human being born that wasn't bad. &gt;&gt; Jesus said, "All have sinned come short of the glory of God." &gt;&gt; We were born in sin, shapen in iniquity. We come into the world speaking lies. We do not have the spirit of godness. That is not the image of God. &gt;&gt; We have to be born again and get a different spirit in here. The greatest thing that we could do if we want to dedicate life is seek God for more Holy Spirit. And don't just seek it for, you know, I just want to be a better person. I just don't want to swear. No, I want to believe all the word of God for my life. &gt;&gt; I want my life to be dedicated to the word of God. I want the word to mean more to me. &gt;&gt; I want to live by the word of God. You know, because if we don't have that mentality, all we're doing is having our own little private denomination, &gt;&gt; just our own little belief system. Now if a person um has um you know who's the author of confusion? Hey, how many's ever been confused before? When when that happens, do you say, "Satan, get out of here." Or or or or do you say, "Why am I so confused?" Did you ever make a decision and just a few minutes later say, 'You know, I think I want to do this. And I don't mean at a restaurant. Okay. The Bible says a doubleminded man is unstable in all the things that he does through his whole being, everything that he's producing. Because Satan, his goal is to divide and conquer. Divide and conquer a a church, a business, a world. Satan's weakening the nations, but he's also wanting to divide us ourselves as an individual. &gt;&gt; He's wanting to fill our lives with confusion. And the only thing that can get our life straight is the word of God. &gt;&gt; And I don't mean the written word of God. I mean the spirit of the word of God. Because when you receive the Holy Ghost, you truly receive the word of God. &gt;&gt; And people want to say, "Well, I got the Holy Ghost. I spoke in tongues. I danced in the spirit and I did all these wonderful things." But yet they're denying the word of God. &gt;&gt; But if you got and look, here's the thing. You can have the Holy Ghost on your body, &gt;&gt; the true genuine Holy Ghost. You can have the true Holy Ghost in your spirit. Dance in the spirit. It could be truly God. Prophesy, speak in tongues. But if you do not get that spirit inside your soul, your nature will not change. So when we're talking about dedicating ourselves, I want you to think about dedicating your heart. The genuiness. You ever talk to somebody and they weren't acting genuine? They're being hypocritical. &gt;&gt; You know what I'm talking about? You see that and you think, "What? What in the world's going on?" &gt;&gt; It It's like there you're not going to go anywhere with God if you're not real. &gt;&gt; And it you can only get real by self-will. &gt;&gt; You let God into your heart and say, "I surrender, Lord, to you. I surrender to the word." &gt;&gt; All right. Are you getting something out of this? Brother Brandham said in the message works is faith expressed. He says but when it's directed from the inside it throws the rest of it together. That's the guidepost. That's the control tower. The inside of the inside. The soul controls the spirit and the spirit controls the body. So an outside whitewash don't make any difference. Them religious people back there that Paul called whitewashes and so forth, they were outward just every way a believer. They had prophecies among them and everything else. But the inside, the soul that disbelieveth, that's the reason I say people can jump up and down, speak in tongues, people can shout, lay hands on the sick, they heal the sick and for so forth by faith, all these great things by the spirit and still be lost. He calls them anointed ones in the message and knoweth it not. Brother Ram says, "Now this outside man is the flesh. That's what we look at, what we see. And it has inlets, five inlets to the body." And any grammar school child as myself would know that there is five senses that control the body. See, taste, feel, smell, and hear. Without that, you can't touch the body. That's the only way to have the body. See, taste, feel, smell, hear. You see it, you taste it, you feel it. Now, that is the evil one on the outside. Now the inside uh now the inside of that is the spirit which you become when you're born in the earth and the breath of life is breathed into him. The spirit is of a worldly nature because it's not given from God but it was permitted by God. Now you got that. For every child that's born in the world, he's born into sin, shaping iniquity, come into the world, speaking lies. That's right. That person inside there is a sinner to begin with. &gt;&gt; I mean, I don't know why my mom and dad never told me that. They told me I was a good boy if I did what they told me to do. Now, it's got five inlets. I don't know whether I can call them right now, but they're listed here. Imagination, reasoning, conscious, memory, and affection. He says you can't think with your body. You have to think with your spirit. You can't have a conscious in your body. There is no mental faculties at all. Your body doesn't. So you have to think with your spirit. You have to reason. You can't reason with your physical being because you your reason because reason don't see it. It don't taste it and don't feel it and don't smell it. It don't hear it. Reason is what you can make in your mind. If you're asleep or you're out, your body is laying there dead, but your spirit can still reason. That's a good one. When you're sleeping and you're dreaming and all that stuff, there is five senses that control that man. Now, to the last man, which is the soul, there's only one sense that controls that, and that's free more agency. It free more uh free agency, free will to choose or to reject. And now the reason that people today don't forget this now you see that the initial evidence of the Holy Spirit now people can live in the spirit dance in the spirit shout in the spirit they can go to church in the spirit they can they can absolutely have the real spirit of God anointed on that ste spirit but still be lost and just as devilpossessed as they can be with that spirit. This is why people get so confused of of a person being a Christian or not a Christian or are are they real or they're not real. See, God's reign can fall on the just and the unjust. And God can use any any body or any spirit when you yield. But when we're talking about becoming in the image of Jesus Christ, we're talking about changing this, the seriousness of our soul being changed. In the message, the greatest battle ever fought, Brother Brandon says, "But somebody get somebody by the arm and say, "Oh, brother John, you know what? Me and you were neighbors at that time. Come up here to the altar and get down." He says, "What are you doing? What's he doing? Wish I had a blackboard here. I could show you what he's doing. He's trying to work through the affection and that don't work. That's not the avenue. Certainly isn't. Maybe he's working in the memory. Oh, brother John have a had a wonderful mother. She died a long time ago. A memory. See, you can't do that. It's got to come down in line with the freemore agency. You got to come to the altar and get serious with God yourself. &gt;&gt; You yourself let the word of God, this is such a powerful quote. You yourself let the word of God, you don't come because your mother was a good mother. You don't come because you're a good neighbor. You come because that God has called you to come and you accept him on the basis of his word. &gt;&gt; That word is what means everything. That word, if you can get everything out of the way, all conscious, all senses, and just let the word come in, that word will produce exactly. It'll produce exactly what it is. Brother Brandon in the message, God's gifts always find their places. As he said, if you're a young woman, dedicate your morals. If you're a young man, dedicate your morals, dedicate your mind, dedicate your thinking, dedicate your heart, dedicate your soul, dedicate all you are, and let Christ work through that. What a glorious thing. The message fellowship brother says now with your heads bowed and the organ continue continuing playing now don't just halfway dedicate yourself. Don't just halfway dedicate yourself. Just think now as you're going down, take from me, Lord, all that is unlike you. Let me be your child from this time on. So, I'm just reading these quotes because you're you're going to somewhere down the line, you're going to be rededicating your life to Christ. &gt;&gt; Brother Random is just showing with us how to do that &gt;&gt; message God's provided approach to divine worship. He says, "You're you're worth something. Each one of you is worth something. God gave his life for you. Why can't you give your life to his? See, it's the inside. You've got to give your heart to God all the way, not part way. Why can't you dedicate yourself and your time all day other come? If you stay, if you don't come with the right approach now, if you just go and start and turn over a new leaf, he says that won't work. You've got to come God's way under the blood. Then that shakina glory in your in in the presence of God. Then you can worship him um the way that you should see. So God don't want us to just try to do a little bit better because our emotions are stirred. We feel like I want to try a little harder today. something is listening to my favorite song and you know I just feel like you know somebody you know said they were sorry and I want to try a little bit harder now it can't be that that's all carnal that's carnal thinking God is calling us to dedicate our life to him body soul spirit everything that we are in a message a man running from the presence of the Lord he says let's just all consec consecrate ourselves to God. Just dedicate ourselves over to the Lord. Take me, Lord. I ain't nothing but whatever I am, Lord. If you can just use me, I dedicate myself to you. And I pray, dear God, for each of one of these these dear people that stood yonder in the mountain in Arizona and cried out. And here they now at the altar with us tonight praying, consecrating their lives. We love you, Father, more than our own lives. We love you more than our families. We love you more than wife, children, father, mother, sister, brother, husband, wife. We love you, Lord Jesus. Make that so real in our hearts, Lord. Pour in the oil of gladness this week, Lord, in our souls. Give us a bathing, a washing of the word by the water of the word, dividing unto us truth. Remember Jesus, he said um th his truth is what sanctifies us. Why it had to be shepherds? Uh what can I do, dear God? What can I do? Help me. and these other shepherds, Lord, around the world, shepherds, talking about pastors, shepherds of the word to proclaim it. Lord, in this next year, help us, Lord. We pray. Give us the love and thy give us thy love and thy spirit and thy light. We dedicate ourselves tonight to thy word and to and to thy call in the in Jesus Christ's name. We receive thy word. Amen. The message possessing all things. And God, you're still the same yesterday, today. You protect your own. We know it's the truth. And we dedicate ourselves a new. Wash our sinful souls, Lord, as we confess our faith. Notice what he's confess our soul. wash our souls, dedicating our soul to you, Lord. In the message, God hiding himself in simplicity, then revealing himself in the same, brother Ram says, "And now that we have a place to dwell, a roof over our head, a clean, nice church to sit in, let's dedicate ourselves newly to the task and concentrate consecrate our ourselves to Christ. Father, we now dedicate ourselves to the service through the word with all that's in us, Lord, and the congregation and the people. They dedicate themselves this morning to the hearing of the word. And we as ministers dedicate ourselves to the preaching of the word. See, it's all around the word. The dedication isn't I just want to be a better person. I just want to have these bad habits. I just I just want people when they look at me, they they don't think I'm like this. No, it's all about us becoming the word. See, we're predestinated to become the word. And the only way we become the word is getting the word in our heart. Not just the body, not just the spirit, but in our heart. &gt;&gt; In the message dedication. So while you are here today, brother Brandham says in the dedication of this material here that the worshippers are coming to worship the living God, why not dedicate ourselves to worship to the worship of the living God and let him fill us with himself and then we shall see his glory around us. Amen. But we are but what we are we give to you. my soul, my strength, my heart, my all. We dedicate ourselves, Lord, on the altar. Not on this little earthly altar here, but we but that real altar that we're all leaning against this morning, weeping with tears as we lay on the eternal altar and ask you to take us and mold us and fashion us your way and make us witnesses, Lord. And may they never forget this morning's message. Amen. We're not going to be able to get them all, but I want to get one more. Oh, that's a long one. We don't have time. Let's stand together. God bless you. I sure you got the the the the message. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We want to dedicate our our soul to the word of God. There'll be times you'll be sitting or you'll be alone and you'll be thinking, "How can I make my house better? How can I make certain things better?" You got to take a stand for the word. Don't ever compromise with the word. &gt;&gt; I would rather literally die and have I remember when I was raising the kids and they were all in the house and Cheryl might remember He remembers. I don't remember. [laughter] But everything was going to stop until we got the right spirit in the home. We just weren't going to let something go. We're going to get things right. And to to me, to get things right is to get our heart right. and and to to walk in the word. And all of us is missing some word. &gt;&gt; Every one of us here is missing some word. &gt;&gt; That's why we come to church is to get more of the word. &gt;&gt; We listen to the tapes. We read our Bibles. We we we pray to get more of the word. &gt;&gt; And that word is what makes us who we are. &gt;&gt; Because you know when brother Brandham says, "Who are you? Your soul?" When you There's a difference between a spiritual Christian &gt;&gt; and a carnal Christian. &gt;&gt; Big difference. When you're looking at somebody and you can tell by the way they're acting what's on the inside of them. &gt;&gt; Jesus said you'll know them by their fruits. &gt;&gt; The fruit is on the outside. Right. But it all because of what's happening inside of here. That's why the outside is like it is. So I just we're going to be thinking, you know, brother um brother Boaz brought this, you know, we got to fight the battle, keep fighting to the end. You know, brother Brando often rededicated his life. &gt;&gt; He just got alone and rededicated himself to God. It's a normal thing to do. Amen. &gt;&gt; But when you're doing it, what we want to be thinking about is the in part of our heart. That alls we have to do is dedicate our heart to the word of God. &gt;&gt; That the word has to become more important to us. Not the things that we want to see changed in our life, &gt;&gt; but the thing that God wants to see changed in our life first. Remember, he stands at the door of our heart and knocks. Not our body, not our spirit, but our heart. Amen. &gt;&gt; And and he says, "If any man will will open the door and let me come in, I'll s with him and he'll s with me. There'll be a a fellowship." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; If my word abides in you and you abide in me, then you can ask what you will and it shall be done. &gt;&gt; So, as we're thinking about consecrating, think about that innermost part of us that God wants to see sanctified &gt;&gt; by his word. Amen. Amen. Let's sing that that song, Pass Me Not. It's been a while since we sang that. Amen. I hope this is your [music] desire tonight.
