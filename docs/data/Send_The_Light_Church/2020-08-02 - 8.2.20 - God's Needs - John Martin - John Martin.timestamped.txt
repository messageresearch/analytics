[0:00] amen and i i would say if i ever
[0:04] or when i do get to that place that god
[0:07] would say
[0:08] all right you got perfect i know at that
[0:10] place
[0:12] i will be wanting more love
[0:16] it's eternal that's what we'll be
[0:18] operating by in heaven
[0:20] because brother brown said nothing but
[0:22] perfect love can enter in
[0:24] so we can't take perfect love with us
[0:26] like in our luggage
[0:29] there's nothing else in the luggage
[0:31] except us except perfect love amen
[0:34] amen well praise the lord everyone
[0:37] it's good to see you pressing in without
[0:40] an orchestra
[0:43] loving god the same way worshiping with
[0:47] all your heart
[0:49] inhabits not the music
[0:52] praise comes from the heart amen and we
[0:56] should never be ashamed that we
[0:58] have an opportunity to worship from our
[1:00] heart
[1:03] when you're in your car or you're
[1:05] walking down the road and you're not
[1:06] listening to music
[1:07] and you got something humming you're not
[1:10] upset that there's no music playing
[1:13] you worship him anyways you praise him
[1:15] anyways at work wherever you're at
[1:18] and i just think it's a wonderful
[1:20] opportunity that we could come and
[1:21] gather together
[1:22] as brothers and sisters of light
[1:24] precious faith to worship the lord to
[1:27] receive of him
[1:28] amen let's look to him in a word of
[1:30] prayer
[1:31] before we open god's word our gracious
[1:34] heavenly father
[1:36] we thank you lord as it's once been
[1:39] spoken lord we thank you for the
[1:41] opportunity to be in your house today
[1:44] lord that there's still freedom in this
[1:46] nation
[1:48] lord seeing that the enemy is crouching
[1:50] on
[1:51] and and pushing the boundaries of
[1:53] constantly trying to take control
[1:56] but lord and we know that your prophet
[1:59] many years ago said one day
[2:01] the doors will be closed something we
[2:04] don't like to think about
[2:06] but lord today we want to say from the
[2:08] bottom of the heart we're so thankful
[2:09] that the doors are open that we could
[2:11] come
[2:12] be with one another and worship you from
[2:14] the dictates of our heart
[2:15] and to look into your word and lord we
[2:18] now
[2:18] invite your presence for the r for this
[2:21] most
[2:22] important part of the service lord that
[2:25] you would reveal yourself we cannot
[2:28] figure you out we cannot attain to it we
[2:30] need the revelation from heaven
[2:33] we pray that you would reveal yourself
[2:35] to every one of us today
[2:36] reveal your heart to us and help us to
[2:39] see you as you are
[2:40] today lord father we ask that you
[2:43] forgive us of our sins and anything lord
[2:46] that would
[2:47] hinder the service or hinder you from
[2:48] wanting to speak to us or
[2:51] convict us where we need conviction or
[2:53] or just encourages us because lord
[2:55] we're creatures that that need
[2:57] encouragement strength and
[2:59] help and lift it up lord i ask lord that
[3:01] you bring a healing
[3:03] and then a feeling of your holy spirit
[3:04] and a deliverance and the lord just says
[3:06] remove anything any doubts or fears that
[3:09] would hinder that from coming to pass
[3:10] today lord
[3:12] god we commit this service to your hands
[3:15] i pray that you'd be with those that are
[3:16] not here today for lord they
[3:19] are needy now is that you would meet
[3:21] their needs according to thy riches in
[3:23] glory
[3:24] we love you we thank you for this now
[3:26] lord we ask it all
[3:27] and give you the praise for it all in
[3:29] jesus precious name
[3:31] amen amen god bless you let's turn to
[3:33] the book of
[3:34] saint john chapter 4
[3:37] for opening scripture saint john chapter
[3:39] 4 i want to say it's really good to see
[3:41] brother bruce and sister donna back
[3:43] with us we brother bruce
[3:47] he really really can help us with
[3:50] with singing when we don't have any
[3:52] music because he's just
[3:55] he's just god has just blessed him to be
[3:57] that good
[3:58] and we surely appreciate him amen
[4:02] amen saint john chapter 4 verse 1
[4:05] when therefore the lord knew how the
[4:07] pharisees had heard that jesus
[4:10] made and baptized more disciples than
[4:12] john
[4:15] though jesus himself baptized not
[4:18] but his disciples he left judea and
[4:21] departed again into
[4:22] galilee and he must needs
[4:27] go through samaria god bless you may be
[4:30] seated
[4:33] we want to entitle this message god's
[4:35] needs
[4:38] and for a subject we want to speak on
[4:41] thinking more
[4:42] about god's needs it's kind of a a
[4:45] different
[4:45] type of a subject because when we come
[4:47] to church we're often
[4:49] talking about our needs our needs need
[4:52] to be
[4:54] met and but we want to talk about god's
[4:57] needs how many
[4:58] was here for a prayer meeting wasn't it
[5:01] a wonderful prayer meeting
[5:03] that um i i got done and i i didn't know
[5:07] how how long it was prayer meeting the
[5:09] actual prayer time
[5:11] so i asked ann i said to anne
[5:15] did we pray just one hour something
[5:17] along those lines
[5:18] because jesus said can't you pray with
[5:21] me just one hour
[5:22] all right the flesh is not willing to do
[5:25] that
[5:26] but it was so easy to pray
[5:29] prayer meet it was so wonderful and the
[5:31] worship before and the worship after
[5:33] i just think we got to build on that for
[5:35] the next service and keep it going
[5:37] because
[5:39] we want to keep the spirit of prayer
[5:41] going because that's really the backbone
[5:44] of the furtherance of the gospel amen
[5:47] amen so god bless you all for coming in
[5:50] and pressing it was just wonderful
[5:54] often we can come to church and be so
[5:56] full of ourselves
[5:58] our wants our desires our petitions our
[6:00] prayer requests
[6:01] our needs and have little to no thought
[6:05] about god's needs
[6:08] if you think about it who would ever
[6:10] think that almighty god who created the
[6:12] heavens and earth
[6:13] would ever have needs anyways i mean who
[6:16] can count the stars
[6:19] the sands of the sea
[6:22] who can create things the ocean the
[6:26] flowers
[6:27] who can count the hairs on her head i
[6:29] mean they're still
[6:30] finding fish
[6:34] and things that man never knew about and
[6:36] how long ago did god create them
[6:41] god is amazing who can see a hummingbird
[6:46] who can see
[6:46] every hummingbird and know how many
[6:49] times he's going to bet
[6:50] his wing in his lifetime
[6:56] but god can rattle those off
[6:59] brother brandon speaking on god's
[7:02] greatness and adoption
[7:05] he said the question was asked yesterday
[7:07] by a theologian to me
[7:09] that's been attending the meetings or
[7:10] hearing the tapes he said one question
[7:13] he said
[7:14] then is god i'm a present
[7:17] then he said he can be everywhere
[7:22] i said he is not omnipresent in the
[7:26] in the way that the word speaks on the
[7:27] present
[7:29] he cannot be a being and then be i'm a
[7:32] present
[7:34] it takes a prophet to say this
[7:38] if he's omnipresent why would you pray
[7:41] for the holy spirit
[7:43] he's if he's on the present he feels
[7:46] every crack corners crevice
[7:48] every cell every fiber and everything
[7:50] that there is i said
[7:51] why did he have to hunt for moses if
[7:53] he's i'm a present
[7:55] at the end why did he run up and down
[7:58] the gardens crying adam adam where art
[8:00] thou
[8:01] if he's omnipresent takes a prophet to
[8:04] say this
[8:06] he's i'm a present because he's
[8:08] omniscient he knows everything because
[8:10] he's infinite being infinite
[8:12] makes him i'm a present being i'm a
[8:15] present then being
[8:16] infinite then he sits in the heavens he
[8:18] abides in the place where he is
[8:20] a being but being
[8:24] infinite he knows all things known every
[8:26] time a
[8:27] a gnat bats his eye
[8:31] knows every bumblebee where he goes into
[8:33] the comb to get his honey
[8:34] he knows every spiral that sits in a
[8:36] tree he knows every thought that's in
[8:38] your mind
[8:38] because he's infinite and on
[8:42] omniscient that is he is
[8:45] not only infinite but he's omniscient he
[8:48] knows
[8:49] everything god
[8:53] is great as great as god is
[8:57] he has needs today
[9:02] hopefully everybody will be saying amen
[9:05] to that before the service is over
[9:09] but they're not needs in the way that we
[9:11] review needs
[9:13] in fact every relationship both parties
[9:17] has needs usually it's your partner
[9:20] that's often responsible
[9:22] meeting those needs you got emotional
[9:24] needs spiritual needs support
[9:26] honeydew list financial comfort safety
[9:29] get the groceries make the meals
[9:31] transportation there's an
[9:33] endless amount of needs in every
[9:36] normal relationship
[9:40] but how often do we think of god's needs
[9:43] and our relationship with him
[9:46] the truth is carnality in our
[9:49] relationship with god
[9:51] will hinder us from seeing god's needs
[9:55] god's spiritual needs because god is a
[9:57] spirit
[10:01] they're not carnal needs the bible
[10:03] teaches us that
[10:05] no man knows the things of god save the
[10:07] spirit of god
[10:11] the bible says that the natural man
[10:13] receiveth not the things of the spirit
[10:15] of god for their foolishness on him
[10:16] neither can he know them because they're
[10:18] spiritually
[10:19] discerned so if we're going to recognize
[10:21] the needs that god has
[10:23] there we've got to get in the spirit and
[10:25] recognize them spiritually
[10:28] the carnal man has a hard time
[10:30] discerning spiritual things
[10:33] like other carnal relationships we we
[10:36] can become so carnal
[10:38] that we're only thinking about our own
[10:40] needs and not the needs of the other
[10:43] but the question remains how could god
[10:46] who created
[10:47] me you and everything that we see
[10:50] have needs
[10:53] the true fact is that god has needs
[10:56] brother branham taught us that
[10:58] inside of god he had a longing to
[11:01] express himself in ways that he could
[11:03] not do
[11:04] in heaven
[11:07] to be able to express certain attributes
[11:09] that were hidden
[11:10] inside of god deep inside of god he had
[11:13] no way he could try to talk to the
[11:15] angels he could try to talk to
[11:16] the beings that he created but they they
[11:19] just couldn't comprehend that
[11:22] that's right this longing to be
[11:25] expressed
[11:26] is a need that god has i want you to
[11:28] understand that
[11:29] amen when you're hungry there's a need
[11:35] because there's a desire
[11:40] and that desire that hunger could become
[11:42] painful
[11:43] god didn't have this little wish list i
[11:45] want this model car
[11:47] he had a pain a deep desire inside of
[11:51] him that had to be fulfilled
[11:53] it wasn't something that he just wish he
[11:55] could have
[11:56] he created this whole thing that's been
[11:58] happening from the beginning
[12:00] just to fulfill that need that's how
[12:02] great god's need is today
[12:05] and we think so little of it
[12:11] don't you want to be the one to help
[12:13] meet god's need
[12:15] amen don't you want to be that mate for
[12:18] him
[12:19] to meet that need
[12:23] there's no way for these attributes to
[12:25] be expressed
[12:26] unless god created a situation
[12:29] that would allow it to happen so god
[12:32] created
[12:33] man in his own image we know that was
[12:36] adam and he was a part of god after god
[12:40] created adam we notice that god created
[12:43] adam
[12:44] with a need yes i want you to think
[12:46] about that
[12:47] yes because god had a
[12:51] that's need and what did he do
[12:59] he created a helpmate for adam because
[13:02] it wasn't good for adam to be alone
[13:07] god still had as
[13:10] much as he had power to create anything
[13:13] he still had a longing
[13:15] inside of him to express himself
[13:19] to someone that was just like him
[13:23] so he took out the feminist part of him
[13:27] and he threw it like this in seed
[13:30] through all the ages
[13:32] and we are his wife in this age
[13:38] think about that amen
[13:41] god created us
[13:44] with needs that only he can fulfill
[13:49] brother brandon says why do you go out
[13:50] there hungering for the things of the
[13:52] world he said because there's
[13:54] god put something in you to hunger for
[13:56] him only god can satisfy
[13:58] and you're trying to fulfill it with the
[14:00] things of the world
[14:02] says it can't be done
[14:08] when god created man in his image there
[14:10] were certain things that god
[14:11] wanted god wanted
[14:15] a man to have
[14:18] the same character that he had the same
[14:22] love that he had god wanted
[14:25] man to have a close divine fellowship
[14:28] with god
[14:30] wanted man to express the same
[14:32] attributes that god had
[14:35] so it was very specific
[14:40] he didn't make man just to be a
[14:43] mini god who who who has power
[14:47] just to uh move nature
[14:51] no he wanted man to be a god
[14:55] that had power to display god's
[14:58] character
[14:59] amen that's what he was looking for
[15:02] because power without character is
[15:05] satanic
[15:07] amen in the message the future home of
[15:11] the heavenly bridegroom and the earthly
[15:13] bride brother brandon said no
[15:15] this here here's god god is god which
[15:18] is the eternal there was no one but him
[15:21] but in god he had attributes
[15:24] yes it was an attribute first in god and
[15:27] he thought of himself as being human
[15:31] and that transmitted him down to jesus
[15:35] and now if you're if you will ever be
[15:38] there
[15:39] he said you was there with him then
[15:44] you talk about predestination you talk
[15:47] about being in his thoughts
[15:51] it's comforting but we still have a lot
[15:52] by faith
[15:55] there ain't enough knowledge in this
[15:57] world to put you
[15:58] at peace with that
[16:02] you have to have revelation it has to be
[16:04] him speaking it to you
[16:08] now god has needs but we often don't
[16:10] think about them because we're too
[16:11] caught up with our lives
[16:14] our relationship with god often crosses
[16:17] passes
[16:18] with viewing god as our personal errand
[16:21] boy
[16:22] to meet our needs and god you know
[16:25] you you know that you promised to meet
[16:27] every need i had and and
[16:29] and uh uh this is how great you
[16:32] are and and and i i need you today
[16:39] i wonder how often we come to god and
[16:41] say i'm here for your need
[16:46] no because we're too caught up with our
[16:48] problems
[16:49] or our goals our desires our wishes
[16:52] our plans it's
[16:55] everything about us
[17:02] god has needs and we need to slow down
[17:04] and just think
[17:06] about this a little bit think about
[17:08] god's needs
[17:09] amen brother brahm said in jehovah jairo
[17:12] the same one that's here amongst us
[17:14] tonight
[17:14] that knows everything about you he's
[17:16] still god
[17:18] and god had a need
[17:21] to talk to abraham like a man
[17:25] so he made himself a body and stepped
[17:26] into it
[17:28] god had a need
[17:34] it's all how you want to think about god
[17:38] your relationship with him
[17:42] that you're part of god but he really
[17:45] don't
[17:46] need you or you're a part of god
[17:49] and he needs you
[17:52] in the relationship i'm speaking of
[17:56] god needs someone to follow his
[17:59] commandments
[18:01] he needs someone to love him to obey him
[18:05] to praise him if he don't get that need
[18:08] the rocks are going to cry out
[18:10] amen he won't inhabit us our homes
[18:14] our church so we need to praise him
[18:19] god needs someone to get to church early
[18:22] and prepare for the body
[18:26] god needs someone to teach sunday school
[18:29] well i'm just going to tell you in my
[18:30] heart god loves the little children
[18:34] i'll leave it go at that god needs
[18:37] someone to pray
[18:38] and intercede for the saints
[18:42] god needs someone to move
[18:45] in the behalf of the needs of others
[18:48] because the effectual fervent prayer of
[18:50] a righteous man god rewards it avails
[18:52] much
[18:53] yes god needs someone to say come lord
[18:56] jesus
[18:57] that's right someone's got to fulfill
[18:59] that the spirit and the bride say come
[19:03] it's important to know that you're
[19:05] predestinated
[19:08] amen but what are you predestinated too
[19:13] it's more than just going to heaven
[19:14] friends
[19:16] god needs someone to fulfill his purpose
[19:20] today his plans today
[19:23] his will today amen and according to
[19:26] ephesians chapter 1 verse 11 god works
[19:28] all things after the council of his own
[19:30] will
[19:30] shouldn't we
[19:35] it's one thing to be predestined to be
[19:37] his chosen bride
[19:39] and it's all together different to be
[19:40] predestined to walk
[19:42] according to his purpose for us today
[19:46] i want you to think about that
[19:50] we so want to hear about how
[19:53] we're so chosen so elected
[19:56] so elite
[20:00] we just want to be told that over and
[20:01] over because it's a good feeling that
[20:03] comes by it
[20:05] but we don't ever want to be told what
[20:07] we're predestinated to do today or
[20:09] tomorrow
[20:14] kind of relationship is that that's a
[20:17] relationship
[20:18] that you're not on the equal terms with
[20:20] god amen
[20:21] amen it's definitely one-sided it's
[20:27] god supply the ham will supply the eggs
[20:31] ephesians chapter 1 verse 11. let's look
[20:33] at this here
[20:34] in whom also we have obtained an
[20:37] inheritance
[20:39] being predestinated
[20:42] according to the purpose
[20:46] of him who worketh all things after the
[20:48] council of his will so god
[20:51] has needs
[20:55] he's working out his will
[20:58] and we have been predestinated
[21:02] to that purpose yes amen
[21:07] not just to go to heaven to help god
[21:10] with his purpose
[21:12] his will in one place the bible says
[21:15] it's an eternal purpose
[21:22] someone is going to fulfill the eternal
[21:25] purpose of god
[21:27] someone is going to meet god's needs
[21:30] because why
[21:31] because they've been predestinated to
[21:35] i mean the pharisees thought they were
[21:37] predestinated
[21:39] they thought they were going
[21:43] they could prove it moses is our father
[21:46] abraham is our father
[21:52] but they didn't want anything to do with
[21:54] the will of jesus for their lives
[21:59] one time isaiah got in the presence of
[22:01] god he said
[22:03] woe is me
[22:06] i am undone i am unclean
[22:10] amen he wasn't talking about pre-dos
[22:13] he said everybody around me is the same
[22:17] way i'm in the same boat therein
[22:19] amen but what made him different
[22:24] he allowed the presence of god to
[22:26] cleanse him
[22:32] and immediately after the cleansing took
[22:34] place
[22:35] showing he was predestinated
[22:41] god didn't say well now you're
[22:42] predestinated that's all that matters
[22:45] as soon as he was cleansed god said
[22:49] who will go for us and fulfill the
[22:51] purpose yes
[22:53] i have niece who's going to go for us
[22:55] excuse me
[22:56] i don't have colvin
[23:03] god has needs
[23:09] after we get so full of the holy ghost
[23:11] so cleansed
[23:13] god gives us a ministry
[23:17] now who's going to go for us
[23:24] he was so full and so thankful to be
[23:27] cleansed
[23:28] that's right that's right he said lords
[23:30] alcohol send me
[23:32] send me he wasn't saying
[23:36] i hope he chooses him hope you don't
[23:39] choose me i hope he chooses that guy
[23:44] why because he felt
[23:48] so strong that he was the bride
[23:51] to the groom he wasn't just
[23:55] a church member that wanted to hear how
[23:58] royal he was and how predestinated he
[24:00] was
[24:01] how elect he was how much he was in the
[24:04] message of the hour
[24:07] it was a real relationship the bride
[24:10] knows the groom
[24:14] not by head knowledge but she can feel
[24:17] the
[24:18] burden that he feels just like a real
[24:20] wife can feel the burden of her husband
[24:22] [Music]
[24:28] we should always look at god in
[24:31] at all he's
[24:34] always amazingly awesome
[24:38] but don't look at god through carnal
[24:40] eyes and a carnal mindset
[24:44] god needs you in the relationship
[24:47] and not for carnal purposes it's not by
[24:49] works it's not just by
[24:50] doing a bunch of things that's right
[24:54] but for love and dedication with a
[24:56] longing to meet
[24:58] every need that god would have
[25:01] come to church with wanting to meet
[25:03] god's needs
[25:04] yes amen and part of it is to get
[25:07] closer to god
[25:11] to take care of the things that he's i
[25:12] have many things to tell my wife but you
[25:14] can't bear it now
[25:17] but after the you seek more of the holy
[25:19] ghost and it comes on you
[25:23] you'll be able to handle it because you
[25:26] can't stay here flesh and blood's not
[25:28] going to inherit the kingdom
[25:29] i'm taking you up there and you've got
[25:32] to get so full of me
[25:35] we can't present to god a badge a
[25:38] certificate to make it into heaven
[25:42] we've got to seek the realness of god's
[25:44] spirit in our lives amen
[25:52] isaiah chapter 66 verse 1 says thus
[25:55] saith the lord
[25:56] the heaven is my throne the earth is my
[25:58] footstool
[26:00] where is the house that you'll build me
[26:03] and where is the place of my rest
[26:08] you read that they what what what need
[26:11] does god have
[26:14] but god don't need us to be carnal
[26:17] amen in that in that way he doesn't need
[26:21] that
[26:23] but what does god need verse 2 for all
[26:25] those things have my hands made
[26:28] and all those things have been saith the
[26:30] lord but to this man well i
[26:32] look even to him that is of a poor
[26:36] and of a contrite spirit and
[26:40] trembleth at my word
[26:42] [Music]
[26:45] that word i fear that word
[26:49] amen you know many people go to church
[26:52] and hear the word
[26:53] they're chewing bubble gum they're in
[26:54] shorts and they don't care
[26:56] they don't reverence the word
[27:01] they don't tremble at it
[27:06] they just want to brag about how much
[27:07] god loves them well that's great
[27:09] but he has another part of the word we
[27:11] need to tremble at that word
[27:12] [Applause]
[27:13] [Music]
[27:18] god has a longing
[27:21] for someone that has the same
[27:24] spirit that he has
[27:28] he's meek he's lowly he's contrite
[27:32] yes
[27:36] blessed are the poor in spirit for they
[27:38] shall see god
[27:39] amen that's who god wants to be around
[27:43] [Music]
[27:45] you could have a seventh grade education
[27:48] you don't have to know any greek
[27:51] you don't have to know memorize five
[27:53] verses in the bible
[27:56] but you gotta have the same spirit he's
[27:58] got if there's
[28:00] you got time seek the holy ghost
[28:03] seek the holy ghost take the time that
[28:06] you're spending with god
[28:07] reading the bible take half of that time
[28:09] and spend it praying
[28:11] seeking the holy ghost with the purpose
[28:13] of receiving more holy ghost
[28:15] not that god would meet your needs
[28:19] because there ain't no greater need that
[28:20] you have than to be filled with him
[28:23] that's the greatest need amen amen
[28:27] well i have it john i have it
[28:31] i have it with john i have it pastor
[28:38] show me in the scripture where that
[28:41] spirit
[28:43] is there
[28:47] and i'll show you a spirit that says
[28:50] more of you
[28:53] i'm going to press to get more i'm going
[28:55] to seek after more amen
[29:00] because that's what i feel every time
[29:01] when god speaks to me i don't
[29:03] ever feel god saying you've done enough
[29:06] for me
[29:08] you're so full of me there's no more
[29:12] room for me in you
[29:16] amen but why do we think we have enough
[29:20] why because satan speaks to our minds
[29:23] and tells us we received the holy ghost
[29:30] okay okay
[29:34] so does that mean i stopped because i
[29:36] received the holy ghost
[29:40] as long as i rece you know what that is
[29:42] to me that spirit that's the same spirit
[29:44] of speaking in tongues as the evidence
[29:45] of the holy ghost
[29:46] it is the same spirit because once you
[29:48] speak in tongues
[29:49] you don't need to try any harder
[29:54] but when you realize that there needs to
[29:57] be more of god inside of you
[29:58] you don't stop you keep pressing on
[30:05] that's a good evidence of the holy ghost
[30:08] brother says it's real easy to know
[30:09] where you're going he says see where
[30:10] you're being drawn to
[30:15] amen when a man humbles himself and
[30:19] begins to tremble
[30:21] at god's word then god begins to express
[30:25] a special attribute of himself
[30:29] and he's only reserved that for the porn
[30:31] spirit for the contrite
[30:33] spirit remember he hides himself from
[30:35] the wise and prudent
[30:36] amen grace is released from god
[30:41] when a man humbles himself
[30:44] to do what god asked him to do and he
[30:47] reserves grace
[30:52] from those that are proud in fact he
[30:54] resists them
[30:56] now all of us at one time have received
[30:59] the grace of god
[31:03] we were in sin we didn't want nothing to
[31:04] do with god that was amazing grace
[31:07] but how many people walked away from
[31:09] this grace
[31:13] doesn't mean grace is going to track us
[31:16] down forever
[31:18] he's knocking on the door we've got to
[31:21] open the door
[31:22] we've got to say lord i accept you
[31:25] right yeah it's got to happen
[31:30] there's a part of the relationship that
[31:33] we have to do and that's what we need to
[31:35] learn
[31:35] we don't need to learn about god we need
[31:38] to learn how to love god
[31:39] how to serve god how to do our part with
[31:42] god amen
[31:44] and if you truly learn god you truly
[31:47] learn god
[31:50] well then that's god inside of you
[31:52] that's you
[31:53] experiencing god that's how you know god
[31:56] it's true experience right it's never
[32:00] through knowledge
[32:03] knowledge will just puff you up and make
[32:05] you think you're bigger than the person
[32:06] sitting next to you
[32:08] that's what knowledge does but the
[32:11] spirit of god coming to you
[32:13] it'll make you get down on your knees to
[32:15] the person next to you
[32:16] and wash his feet
[32:22] with the right type of spirit
[32:29] you build your relationship with god he
[32:31] said blessed are the poor
[32:33] in spirit for they shall see god with
[32:36] the right spirit the right
[32:37] heart the right attitude the right mold
[32:40] of well then a cup of cold water given
[32:43] in his name
[32:44] will not lose its reward
[32:48] what you've done to the least of these
[32:50] little ones you've done unto me
[32:53] that's what happens when the right
[32:55] motive is behind what you do
[32:58] but remember if you don't got the right
[33:00] motive and you do the same act
[33:05] jesus said you have your reward
[33:10] right in other words you're not getting
[33:11] it from god
[33:15] you're getting it from everybody you
[33:16] wanted to do it in front of
[33:20] conspiracies live for themselves
[33:25] they live for others jesus said you have
[33:29] your reward you want to look good in
[33:30] front of them
[33:31] you got it but when you live for others
[33:35] god will reward you on the other side a
[33:38] hundredfold
[33:40] amen amen and that reward is eternal
[33:44] you know the pharisees got a reward from
[33:46] being good boys
[33:49] but it was temporal
[33:54] but the reward that god gives you is
[33:56] eternal
[33:58] it doesn't stop
[34:02] those jews will be following you
[34:03] throughout eternity hallelujah
[34:08] god has a need to express grace
[34:12] but there has to be certain
[34:14] circumstances for that to happen and you
[34:16] play that part
[34:18] there are many attributes that god
[34:19] expresses to man because of his fallen
[34:22] state
[34:23] thus fulfilling many needs that god has
[34:26] many needs that god has amen
[34:30] right you want to express himself as a
[34:32] as a redeemer
[34:34] as a savior as a healer
[34:37] as a provider
[34:41] it wasn't he didn't have nothing to do
[34:43] one day
[34:46] these were needs and he could not
[34:49] fulfill them in heaven
[34:51] with the whole host that he made
[34:54] right isn't that beautiful yes amen
[34:58] it's so beautiful now some
[35:01] appreciate god
[35:05] meeting those needs in our life to the
[35:07] point
[35:09] that they give their heart in the
[35:12] relationship
[35:14] where others don't appreciate it to that
[35:16] point and they just accept god's grace
[35:20] for them
[35:23] in other words there were 10 lepers that
[35:25] got healed yes
[35:28] thank you jesus i'm leaving i'm healed
[35:30] praise the lord
[35:32] one came back and god made him whole
[35:39] think about your relationship
[35:46] praise the lord
[35:50] well that was my foundation
[35:53] i want to touch on a particular need
[35:56] that god has in hopes to provoke
[35:58] you that when you leave here you'll not
[36:00] only be thinking more about god's needs
[36:01] but you'll have a desire
[36:03] to actually help meet those needs
[36:05] because you are his wife
[36:08] god has needs are you willing to help
[36:11] are you willing to start
[36:12] thinking about it just a little bit more
[36:19] one time he had a great need he said i
[36:22] must needs go by samaria
[36:26] but what was the real need what was god
[36:30] really needing why did he need to go by
[36:32] there
[36:34] there was a woman there who needed
[36:38] to become born again
[36:41] and god put her on the right track
[36:44] that was a need that god had
[36:50] god takes no pleasure in the death
[36:54] of the wicked
[36:57] amen
[37:02] but people who are god's seed
[37:05] still in their endemic or satanic
[37:10] nature that they were born with will not
[37:12] be saved
[37:13] unless they're born again now they're
[37:16] not going to become born again
[37:18] unless somebody tells them that they
[37:20] need to become born again
[37:22] and gives them the light
[37:29] he said he that believeth on me the
[37:33] works i do
[37:34] shall he do also amen and greater works
[37:38] because i go to my father
[37:41] but god is still here inside of you
[37:46] he split himself up sister linda
[37:49] all that was in god he poured into
[37:51] christ
[37:52] and at calvary he took a little bit of
[37:55] himself and he put it in every one of us
[38:01] and as a good wife does
[38:04] meets the needs of her husband right
[38:08] i mean there are some wives out there
[38:10] they don't even think
[38:11] about their husband's needs
[38:15] you would think i'd be having a little
[38:17] council meeting with
[38:18] marriage but i'm just speaking the facts
[38:22] it's all about them
[38:27] that doesn't make for a perfect
[38:30] relationship
[38:33] all right did you want me to go on at
[38:35] this point it's going with the message
[38:36] at this point
[38:40] luke chapter 13 verse 11 there was a
[38:43] woman
[38:43] which had a spirit of infirmity 18 years
[38:48] and when jesus saw he called her to him
[38:50] and said unto her
[38:52] woman thou art loose from thine
[38:54] infirmity
[38:56] and all not this woman in verse 16
[39:00] verse 16 oh not this woman being a
[39:03] daughter of abraham
[39:05] whom satan had bound lo these 18 years
[39:08] be
[39:09] loosed from this bond on the sabbath day
[39:14] so here there was another woman
[39:20] who was abraham's daughter
[39:25] god knows who's who
[39:30] who the real children are and who the
[39:33] fake ones are
[39:35] amen and satan is the most religious
[39:42] and the two spirits in the last days
[39:43] would be so close
[39:46] you could hardly tell the difference
[39:49] come on
[39:51] only the elect would know how would they
[39:52] know because they're the only ones
[39:55] following the word
[39:59] and everyone that's not following the
[40:00] word
[40:07] one time he said you are your father the
[40:10] devil
[40:12] he knows who's faking it many will come
[40:15] to me in that day and say lord lord
[40:18] didn't we do this this is i never knew
[40:20] you
[40:21] in the relationship part yes you use my
[40:24] name
[40:25] yes i blessed you yes you let me use
[40:29] your body
[40:33] i mean god use lot but it takes 100 lots
[40:36] to make an abraham
[40:40] you get brother branham says if you give
[40:42] god whatever you give
[40:43] god he'll use of you
[40:48] but he's looking for a relationship
[40:52] timothy chapter 2 verse 19 nevertheless
[40:56] the foundation of god stands sure having
[40:58] this sealed the lord knoweth them that
[41:00] are his
[41:04] amen we got two amens the lord knoweth
[41:07] them that are his
[41:09] and let everyone that is his
[41:13] that that says i'm a christian that says
[41:15] i want to go to heaven
[41:17] amen that nameth the name of christ he
[41:20] has a job to do
[41:21] and brothers and sisters we all got
[41:24] iniquities
[41:25] yes we don't have to go through that you
[41:28] just get up in the day
[41:29] and you'll see there was something that
[41:31] you should have did that you didn't do
[41:36] god knows who we belong to
[41:42] god knows who everybody belongs to now
[41:45] we don't
[41:55] just throw out the net amen amen
[41:59] throughout the net
[42:04] let everybody know jesus is coming soon
[42:07] god has a great need to get the truth
[42:10] to people why the truth is the only
[42:13] thing that'll set him free they must
[42:16] be born again everybody
[42:24] nicodemus i love you you're a fine man
[42:31] you're a teacher
[42:35] you've done some some great things for
[42:37] the church
[42:40] but verily verily i say unto thee except
[42:44] you're born again you cannot
[42:48] see the kingdom of god
[42:51] now what about everybody else that isn't
[42:53] a fine man
[42:55] that isn't helping the church
[43:00] they need to get born again too
[43:03] this is a need that god has
[43:07] why would we sit in church and just
[43:10] enjoy the word for ourself
[43:12] because we've been so programmed by the
[43:15] devil that nobody's going to listen to
[43:17] us when we leave here
[43:21] no one wants it anyways
[43:24] well instead of reading how many more
[43:26] gay people are this year why don't we
[43:27] read
[43:27] about how many more souls that need to
[43:30] be saved before the coming of the lord
[43:32] why don't we read the message a little
[43:33] bit that hasn't changed
[43:36] yes the world is changing it's growing
[43:39] worse and worse
[43:40] the devil knows how to program the world
[43:42] the bible
[43:43] even i'll tell you this is the truth
[43:46] before i ever came to the lord before i
[43:48] ever stepped inside a message church
[43:50] i read in the bible that the devil
[43:52] deceiveth the whole world
[43:55] it's more deceived today than it was
[43:57] back then
[44:04] god promised to do a short work
[44:08] he needs us to be like flint
[44:11] he needs us to be at our post duty
[44:15] he needs us to meet god's need
[44:18] because nothing can be done
[44:22] unless he uses a human being yes amen
[44:26] what about when philip came up to that
[44:28] eunuch and said you understand what
[44:29] you're reading
[44:30] what did he testify how can i know
[44:33] except some man show me the way
[44:38] well that was back then
[44:43] i thought it was an eternal purpose
[44:46] they're souls that need to be saved
[44:50] well nicodemus i just want you to know i
[44:54] kicked lucifer out of the kingdom
[44:56] because he had the same nature that you
[44:58] have right now
[45:00] and i would be unjust to let you to come
[45:03] back into my
[45:04] kingdom with a selfish nature
[45:09] you need to get born again i don't care
[45:12] how good you are
[45:14] well what advocates you being born again
[45:16] you're born
[45:17] of by one spirit we're born into the
[45:20] kingdom of god
[45:23] ain't by what church you go to it ain't
[45:25] by how long you go
[45:27] any by how much you read is by you
[45:30] getting serious about your relationship
[45:32] with god
[45:33] to get the holy ghost
[45:37] amen well brother john i'm kind of on
[45:40] the
[45:41] i'm on the border here with this thing
[45:46] dive in dive into the holy ghost dive in
[45:52] don't tiptoe well i went i went to
[45:55] church
[45:56] you know the truth you know what you
[45:58] should be doing
[46:02] i'm talking every one of you
[46:05] i'm not talking to two people here
[46:11] i want to say that a boy that's what i
[46:13] want to say to you
[46:14] amen that's the truth brother
[46:17] we need it
[46:22] god is looking for men and women who
[46:24] will help
[46:25] meet his great need
[46:28] if one soul is worth ten thousand worlds
[46:31] describe to me the magnitude of god's
[46:34] burden today
[46:38] he's the one that puts burdens on our
[46:40] hearts for souls
[46:42] and we feel that burden for somebody
[46:46] and we begin to pray for them we begin
[46:48] to reach out to them we begin
[46:50] to do something and we feel it's a heavy
[46:52] burden
[46:55] imagine what god feels when he's putting
[46:57] it on so many people
[47:01] if just one soul that you're dealing
[47:03] with is worth ten thousand worlds
[47:06] imagine the great need that god has
[47:09] right now in his heart
[47:10] the burn that he feels for those that
[47:12] are still out of the ark of safety
[47:16] well it's not my responsibility
[47:20] see who programmed you
[47:23] you getting the you be standing next to
[47:25] isaiah
[47:30] you look at isaiah he's god he can
[47:33] handle it
[47:35] we don't have to do that the main thing
[47:39] is we're in isaiah
[47:44] either your spirit is that or it's
[47:46] isaias
[47:48] don't claim isaiah and then do do what
[47:50] you want to do
[47:53] it's a relationship it's not what you
[47:56] claim
[47:59] it's what you live
[48:07] when jesus was going about all the
[48:09] cities in the villages
[48:11] teaching in their synagogues and
[48:13] preaching the gospel
[48:15] matthew chapter 9 the gospel of the
[48:18] kingdom
[48:19] and healing every sickness and every
[48:22] disease among the people
[48:24] there were times that his burden became
[48:26] so great
[48:28] and so heavy that he could not
[48:31] handle it on his own right
[48:35] and what do you say in matthew chapter 9
[48:37] verse 36
[48:38] but when he saw the multitudes
[48:42] he was moved with compassion on them
[48:45] because they fainted and were scattered
[48:47] abroad as
[48:48] sheep having no shepherd
[48:51] now when you see somebody out there and
[48:53] they got
[48:54] all this stuff on their body and their
[48:56] hairs like this and they're wearing
[48:58] these clothes and they're acting like
[48:59] this and they're
[49:00] you know they're just trying to find
[49:01] their identity and
[49:03] yeah that's right
[49:05] [Music]
[49:07] do you look at them as sheep a shape of
[49:11] god
[49:11] that has no shepherd or do you look like
[49:14] at them
[49:16] as someone who's part of satan's
[49:19] kingdom
[49:23] because if you just end with well i you
[49:26] know
[49:26] whatever them
[49:32] is that really the wife
[49:35] of the bridegroom when he's over here
[49:40] having this heavy burden
[49:44] and you're over there whatever is crazy
[49:49] it's like watching tv
[49:58] then saith he unto his disciples the
[50:00] harvest truly is plenteous
[50:03] but the laborers are few
[50:07] pray therefore the lord of the harvest
[50:09] that he will send forth laborers
[50:11] into the his harvest his harvest
[50:16] his he has a need
[50:19] he's looking for laborers
[50:24] do you want to be part of that group
[50:26] that just claims him without laboring
[50:28] that's the majority that's the majority
[50:32] friends
[50:35] oh they can prove it they can quote
[50:36] every quote that's right got the badge
[50:42] quote the scriptures
[50:46] debate debate
[50:53] but you watch what they're doing outside
[50:55] of church
[50:58] you watch what they're doing with their
[50:59] time
[51:01] there's no burden there's no burden for
[51:04] the lost
[51:12] i'd rather have a burden for the lost
[51:14] trying
[51:15] in getting nothing done
[51:19] than to be without a burden and enjoying
[51:21] my life
[51:28] while others had to give their life
[51:31] being burnt on the stake
[51:38] our brothers and sisters went through a
[51:40] lot
[51:44] there's got to be somebody out there
[51:46] that needs you
[51:48] there's got to be somebody in your life
[51:50] around you
[51:51] uh that you don't know that's at the
[51:54] grocery store that's down the road
[51:56] that's in your parties
[52:00] that god will come somewhere in your
[52:02] path
[52:05] that belongs to god
[52:08] and god needs you to get off of your
[52:11] wants
[52:12] and to start helping god with his needs
[52:18] amen
[52:21] i hope you never look
[52:25] at god the same ever again amen
[52:29] amen god has needs
[52:34] we just need to get concerned about him
[52:36] care about him
[52:38] because he's a gentleman he's not
[52:40] someone that's going to force himself on
[52:41] his wife
[52:44] i said you better do what i say no if
[52:47] you're my wife you're going to do it
[52:49] and if you're not predestined to be my
[52:50] wife you won't do it
[52:56] he's not going to tell his servants
[52:57] don't take out the
[52:59] tears and leave the wheat
[53:04] and then himself he would do it
[53:08] he's leaving it for the end come on
[53:12] you don't have to be told
[53:16] the god that lives in you know so much
[53:19] more
[53:19] than i'm telling you
[53:22] [Music]
[53:24] amen he's speaking
[53:28] all the time but we can get so carnal
[53:32] and only be thinking about our needs
[53:38] god has needs he's looking for strong
[53:42] men and women willing to endure
[53:46] affliction because that's what it's
[53:49] going to take to get the gospel to
[53:54] somebody
[53:56] it's not just for some soul to get saved
[54:00] it's for god's elect there's people out
[54:03] there
[54:04] that are just like you
[54:09] that will believe this message
[54:13] we just don't know who they are they're
[54:15] not walking around saying
[54:16] i need the message
[54:20] they're walking around think they got
[54:22] life by the tail
[54:25] oh i was drinking i was smoking i was
[54:28] gambling
[54:29] i was doing everything
[54:32] i didn't know i needed god
[54:38] are other people that need god but they
[54:40] don't think they need god
[54:43] so god's looking for strong men and
[54:44] women who are willing to
[54:46] endure suffering and pain rejection
[54:49] of affliction to get the gospel
[54:56] god looked for a man in saul
[55:03] he did
[55:07] in acts chapter 9 verse 15.
[55:13] when god was looking for a man to spread
[55:15] the gospel
[55:17] he wasn't looking for some lazy
[55:19] know-it-all
[55:24] in fact paul was a know-it-all
[55:28] but he had to lose his know-it-all
[55:30] [Laughter]
[55:32] so whatever you got that you think god
[55:35] can use
[55:41] you might have to lose it
[55:44] that guy can use you
[55:50] paul was a scholar and he was taught by
[55:52] the best
[55:54] brother branham was not a scholar in
[55:55] fact he only had a seventh grade
[55:57] education
[56:00] first church age last church age
[56:09] so it's okay if you don't know much
[56:11] that's all i'm trying to say
[56:14] god can use you in great ways
[56:18] the more you realize that you're needy
[56:20] of him
[56:21] that you're depending on him moses had
[56:24] to throw his 40 years of knowledge
[56:26] away from the greatest university of
[56:28] that time
[56:31] god had a put him through the the desert
[56:35] same place uh saul went
[56:40] into the desert
[56:44] when you get down on your knees in the
[56:45] prayer closet you're in the desert
[56:50] you've got some neology with god you're
[56:52] really learning about god in that place
[56:57] one time god was speaking to one of his
[56:59] children ananias
[57:03] and ananias he was looking at
[57:07] saws just like you and i look at people
[57:10] in the world
[57:11] oh he's a bad man in fact i know god
[57:15] that you would not choose somebody like
[57:17] him
[57:21] but he was predestinated right
[57:25] he was a child of god he was a servant
[57:28] of god
[57:30] he was afraid to go witness to him
[57:35] i'm afraid
[57:38] think about how many times you're afraid
[57:40] to go talk to somebody about the lord
[57:42] that's true it's the truth god needs
[57:45] strong
[57:46] men and women that will bring this
[57:48] gospel to somebody
[57:50] amen amen yes you're going to get
[57:53] rejected that's why you need to be
[57:54] strong
[57:56] but you need the boldness of the holy
[57:58] ghost amen
[58:00] amen
[58:06] ananias had a brother called saul
[58:11] he just wasn't converted yet amen think
[58:13] about that
[58:14] have a vision for the person you're
[58:16] talking to
[58:18] amen god told him in acts chapter 9
[58:21] verse 15 go thy way for he is a chosen
[58:23] vessel unto me
[58:27] to bear my name before the gentiles it
[58:29] must have been a need that god had
[58:31] the kings and the children of israel for
[58:33] i will show him how great things
[58:35] he must suffer
[58:39] from my name saying amen you talk about
[58:42] a need
[58:44] god has needs amen are you concerned
[58:49] i love that message brother brand preach
[58:50] convinced
[58:54] concerned yeah convinced and then
[58:56] concerned
[58:57] if you're not convinced that god has
[59:00] needs
[59:00] you're not going to be concerned about
[59:02] them
[59:04] and that's why the devil is throwing out
[59:07] every kind of distraction in your life
[59:11] gets you involved so involved
[59:14] i talked to a guy yesterday i just i was
[59:17] buying something on craigslist
[59:19] got on the phone and it was a non-stop
[59:21] 20-minute conversation about colvin
[59:24] i said i gotta go i gotta make i gotta
[59:26] make dinner for my wife
[59:30] i did but it was too long on the phone
[59:32] then i had to go to a w
[59:36] but the world is just consumed
[59:39] [Music]
[59:43] i'm not even thinking about god's need
[59:44] every time i brought up god in the
[59:45] conversation
[59:46] he'd just talk about he was a man of
[59:48] science he had a degree in
[59:51] science and and botany and yeah
[59:56] but ain't gonna stop me from testifying
[1:00:02] god has a need for believers to get out
[1:00:05] of the comfort of laodicea
[1:00:07] and go out
[1:00:12] help meet the needs that god has
[1:00:14] [Music]
[1:00:15] just before ascending into heaven which
[1:00:18] the bible tells us
[1:00:19] the heavens must retain
[1:00:23] until the restitution of all things that
[1:00:26] means
[1:00:26] it's up to us to get the job done
[1:00:29] matthew chapter 28 verse 18
[1:00:31] and jesus came and spake unto them
[1:00:34] saying all powers given unto me in
[1:00:37] heaven
[1:00:37] and in earth amen once you look at all
[1:00:40] these commandments here this
[1:00:42] is called the great commandment
[1:00:45] uh no the great commission
[1:00:49] go ye therefore but it's a commandment
[1:00:52] it's it's it's really the fulfilling of
[1:00:54] the great commandment
[1:00:56] right to to love your neighbors you love
[1:00:58] god right go ye therefore
[1:01:00] and teach all nations and baptizing them
[1:01:03] go ye
[1:01:04] teach all baptizing them in the name of
[1:01:06] the father son the holy ghost teaching
[1:01:08] them again
[1:01:09] to observe everything that i've told you
[1:01:12] so whatever i'm doing in my relationship
[1:01:14] with you you're obligated to go tell
[1:01:16] somebody else
[1:01:19] everything teaching them to observe all
[1:01:22] things
[1:01:24] whatsoever i have
[1:01:27] commanded you
[1:01:30] and lo i am with you always even to the
[1:01:33] end of the world
[1:01:35] people need the lord
[1:01:38] and the lord needs people
[1:01:42] to help those people right amen
[1:01:46] i am sure that god must have needs
[1:01:50] go by another scenario samaria right now
[1:01:57] but he needs another vessel i
[1:02:01] he's done with samaria then but maybe
[1:02:04] this is samaria by you
[1:02:08] will you be the one will you offer your
[1:02:11] time to god
[1:02:12] will you let him use your body will you
[1:02:14] present your body living sacrifice for
[1:02:16] him
[1:02:17] will you be the one that's willing to
[1:02:19] prove what is that good and acceptable
[1:02:21] and perfect will of god
[1:02:26] it's not about claiming how much you
[1:02:27] know about the message
[1:02:30] not being satisfied i'm in the message
[1:02:32] it's about offering yourself
[1:02:34] to god let him use you
[1:02:38] because brother brahm did say when the
[1:02:40] last one comes in
[1:02:41] we're going
[1:02:45] so the rapture hasn't taken place
[1:02:49] well who's ever supposed to be looking
[1:02:51] for him there hopefully find him because
[1:02:52] i'm getting sicker you know
[1:02:56] what if god looks at that attitude and
[1:02:58] says
[1:03:00] do i really want that in heaven with me
[1:03:06] i want somebody like me that has a
[1:03:07] burden for what i care about
[1:03:10] you know there are certain people that
[1:03:11] are certain believers
[1:03:14] honestly they're selfish
[1:03:17] it's all about them they only care about
[1:03:19] them
[1:03:23] their life doesn't
[1:03:26] define living for others
[1:03:33] our life should be defining what eternal
[1:03:35] life is to people who are lost
[1:03:40] that's not part time god
[1:03:43] has needs it's time to heed the call
[1:03:46] do you feel the burden today
[1:03:52] you feel his needs because when you feel
[1:03:54] a burden that's god's need
[1:03:58] a lot of times when we feel a burden
[1:04:00] burden comes on us we think
[1:04:01] oh they must be in need i'm going to
[1:04:04] pray for them
[1:04:08] right is that how it normally goes
[1:04:14] and god sees that need he puts on your
[1:04:15] heart
[1:04:19] god is concerned about every one of us
[1:04:22] being healed
[1:04:24] every one of us being prosperous i would
[1:04:27] that that would prosper in all things
[1:04:31] yes even as in even the hell
[1:04:34] even as a soul prosperous something
[1:04:36] along those lines
[1:04:37] god wants us to prosper he wants to to
[1:04:40] bless us in everything
[1:04:44] and we can all be billionaires
[1:04:47] perfect health everything that we desire
[1:04:51] and still not have his character
[1:04:54] still not feel a burden for souls
[1:04:58] so what good is it seeking those things
[1:05:02] when god's heart is over here rather let
[1:05:08] the chips fall whether i'm sick not sick
[1:05:10] money no money
[1:05:12] i have a burden to meet his need
[1:05:15] because that's all that's going to
[1:05:16] matter on the end only what's done for
[1:05:18] christ will last
[1:05:21] not only what christ does for me will
[1:05:23] last
[1:05:26] many people god healed through brother
[1:05:28] branham's ministry not only brother
[1:05:29] brian's
[1:05:30] but many people's ministry and they went
[1:05:32] on to die without the lord
[1:05:34] yes and they turned against the truth
[1:05:40] didn't mean anything except god loves
[1:05:42] them
[1:05:48] that's how much god loves us but god
[1:05:50] loves our soul more
[1:05:54] how many are willing to stand in the gap
[1:05:55] for jesus we're closing
[1:05:57] soon another 25 minutes
[1:06:02] that's soon compared to eternity
[1:06:06] who's going to stand in the gap stand
[1:06:09] for jesus
[1:06:11] be the one because you will be the one
[1:06:16] this is not a group thing
[1:06:20] most people are going to leave this
[1:06:22] service
[1:06:24] saying yeah i heard the heart of god
[1:06:26] that was a good one
[1:06:29] but i want to say it like this
[1:06:32] who is willing to not only hear this
[1:06:35] word but to be a doer of the word
[1:06:40] god has taken on the great
[1:06:42] responsibility
[1:06:44] to get his sheep out of this world
[1:06:48] think about it when you got a car in a
[1:06:49] ditch you got to get it out
[1:06:51] right when the air conditioning goes out
[1:06:55] you got to get an air conditioner
[1:07:01] when the furnace goes out when something
[1:07:03] is in trouble
[1:07:04] you gotta get it out
[1:07:08] when your child's in jail you gotta you
[1:07:10] gotta get them bailed out
[1:07:15] well jesus still has a lot of children
[1:07:17] in jail
[1:07:21] he's looking for someone that's willing
[1:07:23] to go with the badge
[1:07:25] of this gospel
[1:07:29] present the truth a pardon's not
[1:07:33] a pardon us it's received as a pardon
[1:07:37] tell them that this is a pardon for you
[1:07:41] yeah you'll have to convince them that
[1:07:42] they're first sinners
[1:07:46] because they're gonna look at you
[1:07:51] that ain't gonna set me free
[1:07:58] will you be the one will you give your
[1:07:59] time
[1:08:03] just start with taking a chunk
[1:08:06] i'm not asking you to leave here and all
[1:08:08] be monks
[1:08:10] but i am asking you to start carving
[1:08:13] time
[1:08:14] to meet god's needs well brother john
[1:08:18] my my time so filled i can barely
[1:08:21] well let's start with prayer i want you
[1:08:23] to pray
[1:08:24] that god shows you his need
[1:08:27] amen pray he the lord of harvest that
[1:08:30] he'll send laborers into the field
[1:08:33] you can't go pray brother branham said
[1:08:36] like this if you can't go you should
[1:08:39] send somebody
[1:08:43] all right but i hope you're not praying
[1:08:47] for brother gideon to come over
[1:08:48] you know two doors down from your house
[1:08:50] and share the gospel with somebody
[1:08:52] there is a job that you must do that
[1:08:56] don't
[1:08:56] cost you any money and does it cost you
[1:08:59] to get a plane ticket to go somewhere
[1:09:04] think about it you remember the story
[1:09:06] about the the old farmer
[1:09:08] he just sold his farm and everything he
[1:09:10] had and he went over to africa to look
[1:09:12] for diamonds
[1:09:16] while going over there he's he spent his
[1:09:18] money
[1:09:19] his time he dug and dug and he came up
[1:09:22] empty-handed
[1:09:24] so he resorted to come back to his
[1:09:26] hometown
[1:09:28] which he had already sold his farm come
[1:09:30] to find out the man that bought it
[1:09:33] found diamonds in his property
[1:09:38] there could be a soul to the near the
[1:09:41] place that you were
[1:09:43] the place that you live it's one of your
[1:09:46] acquaintances
[1:09:49] don't always be thinking out there
[1:09:52] the footsteps of the righteous order
[1:09:54] lord i wonder why
[1:09:55] because he is leading you i must needs
[1:09:58] go by samaria
[1:09:59] there's a need isn't just about your
[1:10:03] needs friends
[1:10:04] it's about god's needs there should be a
[1:10:06] burden in your heart
[1:10:08] for a brother and sister who's out there
[1:10:10] in sin you need to convince them
[1:10:13] the love of god constrains us
[1:10:17] not to live for ourselves but to live
[1:10:19] unto him
[1:10:20] who once died for us
[1:10:28] are you in love with god enough
[1:10:31] to meet his need
[1:10:36] or are you just worried about your own
[1:10:38] needs in the relationship
[1:10:41] have you been have you been blinded by
[1:10:43] your own desires and wants
[1:10:45] wishes dreams aspirations have you
[1:10:48] forgotten
[1:10:49] the terror of the lord have you
[1:10:52] forgotten to persuade men
[1:10:56] are you in love with god enough to help
[1:10:59] meet his needs
[1:11:01] i know you love god
[1:11:04] but do we love them enough to keep this
[1:11:10] commandment
[1:11:12] jesus said if you love me keep my
[1:11:13] commandments
[1:11:17] yes peter do you really really really
[1:11:19] really really love me
[1:11:24] why did god ask the same question at
[1:11:26] church
[1:11:27] was peter saying when will this service
[1:11:29] be over
[1:11:32] i already said amen to the word i say
[1:11:35] yes lord i love you
[1:11:38] but do you love me enough to feed
[1:11:41] my sheep what they need to make it
[1:11:50] because look at the sheep are not just
[1:11:52] here
[1:11:54] they're not the ones that attend here
[1:11:57] that are not here today
[1:11:59] the sheep are not only them
[1:12:02] but they're out there disguised in
[1:12:06] wall clothing
[1:12:09] no uh not wolf's clothing
[1:12:13] they look like the world they act like
[1:12:16] the world
[1:12:17] they're still his sheep they just don't
[1:12:19] know yet and they're not sitting here
[1:12:21] yet
[1:12:27] but god wants us to keep that
[1:12:29] commandment
[1:12:31] and go out and get them is that true
[1:12:35] and i read it to you i'm closing i
[1:12:37] promise i am
[1:12:39] you know what happens when the preacher
[1:12:41] says i promise i'm closing
[1:12:44] i try never to say that because they
[1:12:46] never close
[1:12:50] john 15 verse 12 this is my commandment
[1:12:53] that ye
[1:12:53] love one another as
[1:12:56] i have loved you amen
[1:13:00] so did god love you just enough to make
[1:13:03] buddies with you
[1:13:06] just to show you how great he is and he
[1:13:08] makes the beautiful
[1:13:09] birds and the trees and the flowers and
[1:13:12] he just the water running
[1:13:16] did he just show you
[1:13:19] love you that way to give you all the
[1:13:21] beautiful things in the world to enjoy
[1:13:23] and
[1:13:28] or did he love you enough to show you
[1:13:30] that you're gonna miss it
[1:13:32] if you don't receive his grace
[1:13:38] did he get down and wash your feet when
[1:13:40] you didn't have
[1:13:42] want anything to do with him
[1:13:46] when you were so caught up in your world
[1:13:49] did he stop you and say
[1:13:53] there's death there the cross is the
[1:13:57] only way over
[1:14:02] this is my commandment that you love
[1:14:05] one another as i have loved you
[1:14:09] greater love have no man than this than
[1:14:11] a man lay down his life for his
[1:14:14] friends and you are my friends
[1:14:18] if if
[1:14:23] you meet
[1:14:26] my needs
[1:14:36] everybody wants to claim jesus as their
[1:14:37] friend
[1:14:40] but how many want to prove it
[1:14:43] how many want to lay down their life how
[1:14:45] many want to carve out some time
[1:14:48] to help meet his need god has a burden
[1:14:51] for those who are lost
[1:14:53] just because we don't feel we don't have
[1:14:55] it doesn't mean
[1:14:56] he doesn't have it
[1:14:59] the first thing he expresses to isaiah
[1:15:02] after cleansing
[1:15:05] is a need to get the truth to others
[1:15:10] and he can't do that unless he has a
[1:15:12] mouthpiece
[1:15:14] will you be the mouth these will you be
[1:15:15] his hands
[1:15:18] praise god you know brother and you
[1:15:21] should say if you can't say amen say oh
[1:15:23] me oh my.
[1:15:27] first john chapter 3 verse 16 the last
[1:15:29] scripture hereby perceive ye the love of
[1:15:31] god
[1:15:31] because he laid down his life for us
[1:15:36] and we ought ought is the big word here
[1:15:41] ought to lay down our lives for the
[1:15:42] brethren amen
[1:15:45] amen let's stand together
[1:15:53] as the musicians will come forward
[1:16:03] you know we don't need musicians but i
[1:16:06] will say this
[1:16:09] will the laborers come forward
[1:16:16] that's who god's looking for amen he's
[1:16:18] looking for laborers
[1:16:22] someone who's willing to roll up their
[1:16:24] sleeve
[1:16:27] and get serious with god
[1:16:32] i'm not asking you to go read the seven
[1:16:35] seals
[1:16:43] i'm asking you to get a revelation of
[1:16:45] the seven seals
[1:16:49] because it is the coming of the lord and
[1:16:51] we need to get in everybody that
[1:16:53] can get in as fast as possible
[1:16:59] bring the seal bring the seventh seal
[1:17:01] the coming of the lord to somebody
[1:17:07] now i know it's been much more enjoyable
[1:17:10] to hear
[1:17:11] about the seventh ceo today
[1:17:15] and why i think it's just around the
[1:17:18] corner
[1:17:20] and tell you about the signs of the time
[1:17:21] and what god showed me about this type
[1:17:23] and that type
[1:17:25] and make you go wow but you know what
[1:17:29] it'd be to me
[1:17:33] to me i just can't do that why
[1:17:37] because
[1:17:41] i feel that i would be doing injustice
[1:17:44] while i'm here
[1:17:54] i want to provoke you to meet god's need
[1:18:00] not to make you feel
[1:18:05] you know more
[1:18:11] i want you to live like you no more
[1:18:18] god is hidden so think about all the
[1:18:20] revelation that brother branham had
[1:18:23] what was he doing with his time
[1:18:26] spreading the good news
[1:18:28] can't get any much simpler than that
[1:18:34] spread the good news
[1:18:38] get rejected it's a good feeling to do
[1:18:41] that for the lord
[1:18:42] you ever do a hard day's work and you
[1:18:44] just felt good about what you did
[1:18:47] even if it didn't turn out real nice and
[1:18:49] pretty you know you gave it your best
[1:18:52] that's how it is when you gave you give
[1:18:54] your best to share the gospel
[1:19:01] you will get rejected at times and you
[1:19:03] will feel like you got rejected
[1:19:06] but it's really the lord
[1:19:12] amen let's bow in a word of prayer
[1:19:17] maybe there's someone here today that
[1:19:19] desires prayer
[1:19:23] maybe there's someone here
[1:19:27] that really hasn't felt i'm just going
[1:19:29] to
[1:19:30] ask how many has been
[1:19:34] not even thinking about god's
[1:19:38] needs now i'm not asking to raise your
[1:19:40] hand today
[1:19:42] and i'm not looking anyways but i just
[1:19:45] want
[1:19:46] you to be honest with god
[1:19:52] have you felt
[1:19:55] a burden for god's needs
[1:19:59] have we been even thinking about them
[1:20:06] the laodicea was so caught up
[1:20:10] in themselves that they had need of
[1:20:12] nothing when
[1:20:18] get god out of their lives out of their
[1:20:20] church
[1:20:24] i want to invite you today
[1:20:28] to make
[1:20:31] your heart known to god not
[1:20:35] just well god knows my heart already
[1:20:38] but to make that stand god from this
[1:20:41] point forward
[1:20:43] i want to work on meeting your needs
[1:20:47] i want to turn my life my ship my boat
[1:20:49] my desires my direction
[1:20:52] i want to start turning
[1:20:56] towards fulfilling my husband's needs
[1:21:01] now god sees the hand of your heart
[1:21:06] the desire to defy a lazy nature
[1:21:12] and to lift up
[1:21:15] a strong
[1:21:18] dedication to him
[1:21:22] and that's where you stand today let's
[1:21:25] unite together and for a heavenly father
[1:21:28] we thank you for your word
[1:21:34] thy word is a lamp
[1:21:38] to our path allah light for our feet
[1:21:42] it's
[1:21:44] it shows us
[1:21:47] where to walk
[1:21:50] and lord we lord we don't want to walk
[1:21:53] today
[1:21:54] in our own direction
[1:21:58] blinded by our own selfish needs
[1:22:03] remember one of your servants
[1:22:06] perhaps maybe maybe 30 years ago brother
[1:22:09] hankins
[1:22:11] said i've learned not to pray for my
[1:22:13] needs
[1:22:15] because god promised to meet my needs
[1:22:18] i'll pray for the needs of others
[1:22:24] lord we do trust you for our lives
[1:22:29] and you brought a son a prophet in this
[1:22:31] age and gave us a little glimpse
[1:22:34] when he said the missionary work was
[1:22:35] always in the will of god if you want to
[1:22:38] find favor with god do missionary work
[1:22:43] lord we know it's your heart today
[1:22:46] for the souls that are not saved yet too
[1:22:50] often
[1:22:51] we think about others
[1:22:54] today we're asking lord that you would
[1:22:57] increase
[1:22:58] a burden as that song we
[1:23:02] sometimes seen that course lord lays
[1:23:04] some soul upon my heart
[1:23:08] may we ever do our part to win that soul
[1:23:11] for thee
[1:23:13] lord i pray for every hand that was
[1:23:15] lifted
[1:23:17] in her heart that desire
[1:23:20] to dedicate themselves
[1:23:23] to being
[1:23:26] the wife that wants to meet her
[1:23:30] husband's needs i pray that you would
[1:23:34] give them
[1:23:36] uh the portion of yourself
[1:23:41] that they could feel that burden
[1:23:44] that longing that desire even the pain
[1:23:49] for someone who's not walking in truth
[1:23:54] that they could know exactly how their
[1:23:58] their husband feels what a
[1:24:02] what a joy it is to see
[1:24:07] a man come home from a hard day's work
[1:24:10] and struggling
[1:24:13] and that wife just try to meet
[1:24:16] comfort
[1:24:20] just being a real help me
[1:24:26] lord the prophet said
[1:24:32] just you walked
[1:24:35] this earth 33 years old
[1:24:38] some people thought you looked 50
[1:24:40] because you look so old
[1:24:43] the burden that you carried to that
[1:24:45] cross
[1:24:50] lord we just we just want to share that
[1:24:53] with you
[1:24:54] we know we can't do everything
[1:24:58] but lord we don't want to shun the
[1:25:01] responsibility of doing our part
[1:25:04] let us be like paul who said i have not
[1:25:07] shunned to declare unto you the whole
[1:25:08] council god
[1:25:14] he suffered many things and he wasn't
[1:25:15] afraid
[1:25:17] of suffering more he wanted to fight a
[1:25:20] good fight to the very end
[1:25:24] god we want to have that same testimony
[1:25:30] bless every brother and every sister
[1:25:32] here lord
[1:25:35] lord if there'd be some here today that
[1:25:38] don't have the
[1:25:39] longing and that desire in this way
[1:25:44] i pray that you would continue to speak
[1:25:46] to them
[1:25:47] help them to see the importance of
[1:25:49] pleasing you
[1:25:52] we love you we commit ourself in your
[1:25:54] hands and i pray
[1:25:56] that through your visitation to us today
[1:25:59] lord
[1:26:00] that there would be some soul that would
[1:26:03] come
[1:26:03] forth from each one's neighbors god will
[1:26:07] be careful to praise you throughout
[1:26:08] eternity for it
[1:26:10] for we humbly ask
