weathered the sicknesses amen but how many happy to be here worshiping the Lord today amen let's give the Lord a a praise offering I do believe there some songs in here that would testify of the word today amen plus we're going to use one of brother Ron's scriptures from the men's meeting amen turn with me if you would and to the Bibles now to Matthew chapter 22 as we look into the word amen Matthew chapter 22 well we don't usually like to single people out but we wanted to wish brother Mike Helms a happy birthday today amen amen before we begin reading here in Matthew 22 I wonder if there'd be anyone here today that say brother John would you remember me in prayer amen I do believe that God can through the word can meet our needs amen let's look to him in prayer our heavenly father we thank you for this opportunity that you've given us to gather together in this warmth of this building Pro protected from the elements and the cold and Lord we thank you that you have chosen a place to meet your people Lord that these songs that we could worship you in today to express our thankfulness to you our adoration and Lord all that you mean to us know that you inhabit the Praises of those of your people through this through the worship now Lord you see our hands that have been lifted we have needs we have uh uh yearnings and desires and we ask Lord that you'd come in a supernatural way and minister to every one of those needs Lord we also know that you have a word for us just for us and we pray Lord through this message today that we would be able to catch what it is that you would have for us Lord let us not miss it open our ears open our hearts to be able to receive it Lord that we might uh be about your business we pray we thank you for these things now as we trust your grace in the in the reading of the word word in Jesus Christ's precious name amen amen Matthew chapter 22 we're going to begin reading at verse number 15 then went the Pharisees and took counsel how they might entangle Jesus in his talk and they sent him out and they they sent out uh sent out unto him their disciples with the herodians saying master we know Thou Art true and teachest the way of God in truth neither carest thou for any man for thou regardest not the person of men tell us therefore what thinkest thou is it lawful to give tribute unto Caesar or not now notice their motive and Jesus perceived their wickedness and said why tempt ye me ye Hypocrites show me the tribute money and they brought unto him a penny and he said unto them who is this image and superscription and they said unto him Caesars then saith he unto them render therefore unto Caesar the things that are Caesars and unto God the things that are Gods when they heard these words they marveled and left him and went their way amen amen God bless you may be seated for subject today we want to talk about the things that are gods and entitled this message what belongs to God what belongs to God I don't know if it's something that you've thought of very much I mean he created everything he said Heaven is my throne Earth is my foottoo what will you what house will you build me but it's a good it's a good thought because Jesus here he said we need to Render unto God the things that are Gods amen notice here leading up to this that there were these Pharisees and uh the heronian they wanted to actually uh trick Jesus and there's always going to be people uh who disagree with the word that's that that's going to try to entangle you right when you when you have the spirit of Christ inside you the devil desires to entangle people with the spirit of Christ to try to twist them up when they're trying to do something good for the kingdom of God that Spirit brother B said people die but the spirit still lives on and so we know that that spirit is tries to get in there just to cause uh people to trip up the true people of God instead of helping Jesus they chose rather to tempt him and some people will even pull out scriptures or quotes to try to twist try to mix you up Master we know that thou art true a teach us the way of God In Truth neither carest thou for any man for thou regardest not the person of men in all in their motives that people have Jesus perceived their wickedness it's wicked to try to trip somebody up when when it is the spirit of God in them but I want to say God bless our visitor here but I'll say that if somebody's got a wrong Spirit that's another story because that needs to be called out are you with me but the thing is you better make sure that you know what you're dealing with because if you're doing that against the spirit of God Jesus said render therefore unto Caesar the things that are Caesars Jesus believed in rendering to other the things that are duee to them and that means that word render means to give back to others to recompense to make amends to others and he shares this in his word where the word says esteem others better than thyself to honor all men especially those of the household of faith because Christ laid down his life for us we ought to lay down our lives for the Brethren 1 Timothy 2:1 says I exhort thee therefore that first of all supplications prayers intercessions and giving of thanks be made for that word all all all men amen for kings and for all that are in Authority that we may lead a quiet and Peaceable life in all godliness and honesty so we see here that God really wanted things to be rendered to Caesar that belonged to Caesar now I know that l lot of people hate the government for one reason or another and I'm sure Caesar was not a perfect you know I'm sure Caesar was not perfect but yet Jesus said render onto Caesar the things that are Caesars of course we knew they were talking about taxes at the time now we're living in such a Godless age perilous time churchgoers ungrateful unthankful if you do something for somebody and it isn't just perfect they'll let you know ain't just perfect and they they'll they'll they'll reward you for it amen in other words there's no genuine agape love amen and Bible says because iniquity would abound the love of many would wax cold indifferent without affection 1 Thessalonians 5:15 we're just kind of laying a foundation here 1 Thessalonians 5:15 see that none render evil for evil unto any man so we're supposed to render but not evil for evil so if somebody does evil to you you have no right to do evil back but ever follow that which is good Romans 12:17 says recompense no man evil for evil Jesus taught us in Matthew Chapter 5 to do good to them that hate us and pray for them that despitefully use us and persecute us and bless them that curse us to Simply and always love our enemies I like this Romans 13:8 Romans 13:8 says oh no man anything oh no man anything and you know what we think about maybe in that aspect we think money right owe how much I owe you got to pay you back but doesn't talk about money here even though money is a part of anything but look what it says owe no man anything but to love one another so it's very easy to ow somebody love come on you know we just we don't feel we have to just you know love somebody because we don't want to ohe no man anything but to love one another for he that loves another have fulfilled the law so the love of God constrains us to labor to to to give back to others by loving them I don't want to be guilty of not loving somebody it don't cost any money now here's the thing more than likely when you love somebody it doesn't mean you're going to get love back fact you you may get some stabs but according to the scriptures that we read we owe it to everybody to love everybody Caesar everybody verse number six for for this cause pay ye tribute pay you tribute for they are God's ministers attending continually upon this very thing render therefore to all their du their dues tribute upon to whom tribute is due even a custom custom to whom custom Fear To whom fear and honor to whom honor I mean you think about God's ministers here but we really owe the fivefold ministry a lot they're the ones that bring us to Perfection so but often we just don't feel we owe them anymore than whatever we give did you know that we need to render forgiveness to others we in other words we owe forgiveness belongs to others now we're told to forgive stimes 70 and there's even a contingency upon us about being forgiven our prayers should not only include asking God for forgiveness for ourselves but for others Jesus said in Matthew 6:12 and and forgive us our debts as we forgive our debtors verse 15 but if you forgive not the men their trespasses neither will your father forgive your trespasses so the more evil that's done to me the more I'm in debt to forgive are you are you understanding what I'm saying and it's important that we forgive everybody that's the only way you can have confidence that God's going to forgive you if we don't render what belongs to others then God will not re render forgiveness to us think about that we need God to forgive us but it has everything to do with everybody that hates us everything that everything it has everything to do with what every the the wrong that people have done to us our forgiveness from God hinges on my attitude towards those that hate me think about what I'm saying saying here we want to make such a separation between God and other people and you can't Jesus said what you do to the least of these little ones you do unto me remember when Saul was persecu persecuting the church and and God Jesus met him on the road to Damascus and Jesus said why persecutest thou me but he was persecuting all the other people we don't realize that it's when you hurt somebody you're hurting God so what you do to somebody what you hold what you what you don't forgive you're you're actually doing it unto God God does not want us owing anything to anybody including Caesar render their unto Caesar the things that are Caesars and render therefore unto God the things that are Gods God wants us to render to him the things that belong to him I have a question for you what belongs to God how often have we ask the question what things do I have that belong to God what what do i p personally own in myself that really belongs to God a lot of people don't feel they owe God anything in other words they are debt free they may give you a scripture like this and it's a true scripture Jesus said if the sun therefore shall make you free you shall be free indeed but we will always be in debt to God love is always in dead if there's one Revelation I got this year it's that statement love is always indebted always and always will be Jesus said if someone asked you to go a mile you're in debt to go two if somebody smacks you on the cheek you're in debt to turn the other one see we're in debt more to God than what we realize Romans 8:11 tells us but if the spirit of him that raised up Jesus from the dead dwell in you he that raised up Christ from the dead shall also Quicken your mortal bodies by the spirit that dwelleth in you therefore brethren we are what debtors not to the flesh to live after the flesh we are debtors so there is to it now we want to live without feeling like we owe like like I don't want to ask somebody for something because I feel that I'm going to owe them I'm telling you wake up in the morning you're in debt you got breath in your lungs you got a beat in your heart God gave you another day you are in debt to God he forgave you of your sins he's covered you we're in debt to God we can't get away from it but the thing is we should want to we should want to be a servant second Corin Ians 5:14 says For the Love of Christ constrain us because we thus judge that if one died for all then we're all dead and that he died for all that they which live should not henceforth live unto themselves but unto him that died for them and rose again so here it is we we're not even allowed to live for ourself amen I mean before we became Christians we could just do what we want to do but when we we receive the salvation of God we're no longer to live unto ourselves anymore but unto God now why would God want us to remember the nail scars prince in his hand when we get to heaven God never wants us to forget the price that he paid for us and in remembering the sacrifice we will render him the praise that's due to his name but you know a lot of people forget what God had did for them if you ask them do you know about Calvary do you believe God died you they'll say yes but through the course of the day they don't even think about it 1 Peter chapter 1 tells us according as his divine power have given unto us all things that pertain unto life and godliness through the knowledge of him that have called us to glory and virtue Now where's the calling to he's called us out of the world and he's called us to glory and virtue that's what he's calling us to so we're told now in these following scriptures we've read these many times that we're to add to our faith virtue and knowledge and Temperance to add these things because that's what he's calling is too and that if we are adding them to our life if we're consciously trying to add them to our life then our life will never be Barren and unfruitful is that what the scripture says but verse eight says for if these things be in you and abound they make you that you should neither be Barren or fruitful in the knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ but he that isn't even thinking about lacking he he that's not even even thinking about adding in other words you're just trying to get through the day trying to make money you know trying to build their build their future when they're not even thinking about adding the character of Christ to their life this is what happens but he that lath these things is blind and cannot see a far off and have forgotten that he was purged from his old sins God doesn't want that that's why the nail scars are going to be in there that's why when we get to heaven God does not want us to forget Calvary because it means more to us than what we realize a man can be so consumed with himself that he forgets what Christ did for him forget all the things that are supposed to be of God because if you forget Calvary you you forget the things that belong to God that's kind of why I wanted to go through that so what things do I have that belong to God I believe praise is one of them I like that we sung that song I will enter his Gates today all ye that have breath praise ye the Lord that's scripture that means I'm in debt to praise God you know sometimes we'll come to church and we don't feel like praising God sometimes we get up in the morning and we pray we don't feel like praising God sometimes we just don't have the feelings and it we don't need the feelings but we do need the faith we need the faith to praise God that he's truly worthy of all praise amen even the leaves the Bible tells us clap their hands we know God would have the Rocks the the lightning the Thunder even when Jesus was born nobody on Earth knew about it God sent out of Heaven angels to give him praise God really wants to be praised no brother BR you do anything too much but you can't pray too much but I'll say it like this I think we're really lacking on praising God praise today still belongs to him I don't know did brother Ron did you say something like Annie up did you say something like that I say we need to pay up we need to pay up on praising God Hebrews 13:15 says by him therefore let us offer the sacrifice of praise to God continually right I don't know what that means to you but if I am sure if I ask you do do you do you I'm gonna pick on sister Lori for a second oh no don't do this this is an easy one sister Lori do you breathe continually yes if we did not breathe continually we would die but do we praise God continually we owe God we owe God praise this whole thing is about stirring us up to give God what is God's we want to give our home this we want to build this and God's house goes empty we don't want to reach out to another soul but we're consumed about our lives we owe God Amen the world ain't going to give God what belongs to him if it ain't coming from us he ain't going to get it that is the fruit of our lips not getting upset not swearing not lying the fruit of our lips giving thanks to his name but to do good now look at this and to communicate forget not God does not want us to forget about communicating praise to him but you know what helps us to forget I had such a hard day right you know I am so busy in fact I just as soon as I'm out of here I'm back to work you know there's going to be more more praise next Sunday for a pig skin ball flying in the air more money given than the offerings in the church that day and it's going to be a big thing I believe God wants to see his children communicate praise to him I believe that with all my heart for with such sacrifices God is well please he knows it's a sacrifice our flesh don't want to do it our flesh does not want to do it how many times you not really wanted to pray but you got down there anyways and if you stayed there long enough till his presence come you were happy yeah and and and this is all I want to say is is don't go by what you feel go by what you believe if you believe God is worthy praise him if you go by what you're feeling you're going to feel oh I'm a I'm unworthy I'm a hypocrite and I don't feel like it what you know people are going to think just forget all that forget one thing him he's worthy to be praised Thanksgiving belongs to God I'm going to steal this scripture from brother Ron in our men's meeting first Thessalonians 5:18 I didn't give it to you Ann but it says in everything give thanks for this is the will of God in Christ Jesus concerning you talk about indebtedness you talk about what we owe it comes right out there and it says it is the will of God that we give thanks for everything you know what we're good at you know what we're good at Bob sorry about every call on you Sister We're so good at complaining we don't even have to try and we're good at it you want to know why because we got so many problems we deal with so many things pra soon say we're good at it we need to get good at giving thanks amen well why would somebody give thanks that because spilled the the the milk on the floor because it is the will of God in Christ Jesus we got to we've got to just come to agreement that this word is better off than how we feel right amen our feelings want to complain it's it's acceptable just deny it deny it and give thanks to the Lord First Chronicles 16:34 says oh give thanks unto the Lord for he is good and his mercy endureth forever oh give thanks to the Lord I don't want to be one that God looks at and says where are the other nine where the other nine there's only this one that came back to give me Glory where are the other nine I want I think God is calling us to be oddballs to be super happy in giving praise to God Amen like what does it matter if you really want the devil out of your life praise God I'm telling you demons I I don't even care if it's sickness depression I don't even care what it is you praise God long enough the demons got to get out because God in habits the Praises of his people it is the devil's job to get you like I don't feel like it but we owe God Thanksgiving we owe it to him and Thanksgiving is the price that we pay to actually enter into his Gates Psalms 100 verse1 Make a Joyful Noise unto the Lord All Ye Lands serve the Lord with gladness come before his presence with singing praise God for our worship leaders amen who who pray and who desire to get us to a place that we could worship God in spirit and Truth know ye that the Lord he is God and he it is that made us not we made ourselves we are his people and the Sheep of his pasture sometimes we come to church and we think God didn't make us right no God made us but know that came from my mom and dad well first of all the only way that you came is God ordained you out of 1 million people that could have been and he chose you and by the way if you've been born again you're no longer of your mom and dad amen enter into his gates with Thanksgiving into his courts with praise be ye thankful unto him and bless his name I talk that's about attitude you got to have that attitude when you come into this place and if you don't I think you need to spend some time in the prayer rooms that's why we got the prayer rooms and I'll be I'll be honest with you if you got that attitude I think it's good to spend some time in the prayer rooms because it just makes the whole worship service beautiful how many times have you seen Brother Bruce up here or brother Ry up here and they're they're trying to get us to like be happy to just be to praise God to praise him to be to be excited about being in a Christian being in the house of the Lord how often have we seen that and how do we respond I want you to know that is not Brother Bruce brother Ron that's God in them calling you to give what's due to him amen it's the scripture and I'll tell you I I don't want to be in a place where no God I'm not going to give you what I owe you I'm not going to do it I don't feel like it I am not in the mood don't bother me don't you go there that's how we act sometimes instead of just saying I'm wrong you're right Praise You Lord amen just agree with the word for the Lord is good his mercy endureth for Everlasting his truth endureth to all generation since this generation God has given us the truth we have something to rejoice in respect honor and Glory belong to God did you ever hold back from God from respecting God respecting God's house respecting his word respecting his people did you ever hold back from respecting God's people did you ever try taking honor and Glory away from God like look at me look at me look what I did I mean that belongs to God Amen Psalms 96:6 and it's okay if you want to say Amen to the word honor and Majesty are before him strength and beauty are in his Sanctuary just look around at your brothers and sisters look at what God has done in their life if that is not enough that you want to praise God I mean when we look at our loved ones that are not in church that are not walking in the truth and we wish they would why not look around and see what the good that God is doing in one another see the beauty of the Lord in his Sanctuary give unto the Lord all ye kindreds of the people give unto the Lord Glory strength in other words put your heart into it the called under when put your strength into it I want you to come to church Sunday with a different attitude like you really owe God before you get here not I'm going to church to try to get something out of God give them what you owe them do you know brother Bron said no service is complete without an offering in other words we owe it verse eight give unto the Lord the glory due unto his name I like that it's due so let me ask you what do you owe God today you ow him glory right there there's the scripture you you are to give the Lord Glory due to his name bring an offering and come into His courts oh Worship the Lord in the beauty of Holiness fear before him all the Earth just some scriptures in line with this 1 Timothy 1:17 now unto the king Eternal Immortal invisible the only wise God be honor and Glory forever and ever it sounds like it's not going to stop why are we why are we letting the devil stop us from praising God why do we do that we got to get out of the flesh get into the spirit I would rather just praise God and not feel like it than wait to try to feel like it okay come on song leader get me to feel like it come on preacher make me feel like it and then I'll do it what what is that what is that it's not a sacrifice it's not by faith it's you being too proud that's exactly what that you want to know why people don't praise the Lord because they're too proud too it's it's a truth there's too much pride Revelations 4:11 Thou Art Worthy oh Lord to receive glory and honor and power for thou has created all things and for thy pleasure they were I are and were created and so this is in Revelations the last book in the Bible revelations 511 and behold I heard the voice of many angels round about the throne and the Beast and the elders and the number of them were was 10,000 times 10,000 and thousands of thousands in other words try to put a number to it right saying with a loud voice voice Worthy is the Lamb that was slain to receive power and riches and wisdom and strength and honor and glory and blessing so think about all these angels that God has created to worship him because he went and died for us at Calvary and we sit here and have a hard time mustering up enough love to give to Jesus amen what is going on I mean we owe we owe big time give unto Caesars what Caesars but give unto God what's God's and every creature which is in heaven and on Earth and under the Earth and such as are in the sea and all that are in them heard I saying blessing and honor and glory and power be unto that to him that sth upon the throne and unto the lamb forever and ever that means right now and when you die I mean there's you know brother Bram said it like this if you don't if you don't like praising God right now if you you don't like this getting excited and praising God now you're going to feel uncomfortable in heaven he said you might well just get used to it just get the old Boogie woggies out of you get them out of you get them out of your head get them out of your mind praise prise God Amen Revelations 191 and after these things I heard a great voice of much people and you know what they were in heaven saying Hallelujah Salvation and Glory and Honor and power unto the Lord Our God that's what's going to be happening we might as well get started here when's the last time you said hallelujah amen when the last time he said power unto Jesus and we we we sing there's power in the blood because it's our benefit right we get benefited from that but what about just giving God praise for that power amen all right what else Belongs to the Lord yes we're going to talk about offerings offerings belong to God Malachi 3: 6 and so this might after we get done with these scriptures this might be a perfect time to take up an offering for I am the Lord I change not notice that I got that underlined I am the Lord I change not so I I want us to remember this that he doesn't change here therefore ye sons of Jacob are not consumed even from the days of your fathers ye are gone away from my ordinances and have not kept them return unto me and I will return unto you sayeth the Lord of hosts but you say wherein shall we return in other words they feel that they've already been here just like Leo deia I'm in need of nothing I'm here he said will a man rob God I don't think so yet you have robbed me but you say wherein have we robbed the Real playing in ties and in offerings they're two different now ties and offerings that we literally Rob God he owns a cattle in a thousand years he made all the gold he's the one that's brought value to everything but yet we rob god of what belongs to him not just a tenth of your ties but all offerings what about the lights what about the visiting ministers that we got to pay a hotel for what about the missionaries that we support overseas the Bibles we said and all what about all that are you behind that then have a burden give to that because we literally oh God we got scripture right here that we're robing something that actually belongs to God verse N9 you're cursed I don't want that you're cursed with a curse for you have robbed me even this whole nation here's the remedy for the curse bring ye all the tithes into the storehouse that there may be meat in my house and prove me now wherewith sayeth the Lord of hosts if I will not open the windows of heaven and pour out a blessing out I pour you out a blessing that there shall not be room enough to receive it wow I that that to me if I was struggling in my life financially that promise I would hang on to and that is such a small price to pay you pay a little bit to have all your needs taken care of in fact not just your needs taken care of but says you'll get a blessing they won't even have room enough to contain it there's no Switzerland with God as I've often said you're either in line with the word or you're robbing them so offerings belong to God as well John 10:7 then Jesus said unto them again verily verily I say unto you I am the door of the Sheep all that ever came before me are thieves and robbers but the Sheep did not hear them in other words you you hang out with somebody that don't pay their ties I mean real sheep ain't G to pull bite into that stuff not going to do it oh you don't got to do this and you don't got to go to church and you don't got to be faithful here you don't got to do that in other words theves and robbers if somebody came over and they they stole something out of your house they stole that belong to God I work for it people go years and they never get that Revelation you wonder why they don't get it they don't want the revelation don't want the responsibility of having to give God what belongs to God they rather be selfish and God looks at those people as being thieves and robbers in other words they want God's blessing they want to pray they want to got to count on it that God's going to be there meet their needs but they're not really worried about what ow God God is a giver but that doesn't mean that God wants a selfish bride he wants a bride that's a giver and God loves a cheerful Giver so what belongs to God we belong to God our heart belongs to God our life belongs to God Calvary didn't just buy our Salvation it purchased us it purchased our life it purchased our will First Corinthians Ians 620 says for you are bought with a price therefore glorify God in your body and in your spirit which are Gods so all these decisions that you're making about what you want to do and what you're not going to do when the word tells you plainly what you should be doing you do understand your make your life your life is making a declaration that you are not bought by Christ it's one thing to be stubborn rebellious fall make mistakes it's another thing to say no what I've not given my life to Christ if we're all bought by Christ then we all belong to Christ that's why we don't say I'm going to do this I'm going to do that in fact it's evil it's a sin we should never say that we should say the Lord willing we're gonna go here we're going to do this we're going to do that why because we now God has bought our will he's bought our life Deuteronomy 65 says and thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart with all thy soul with all thy might and these words which I command thee this day shall be in thine heart Thou shalt teach them so I say to the parents today with children teach them diligently unto thy children talk with them when thou sest in thine house and when thou Drive in the car and walk in the way when th go to bed and when thou get up in the morning talk about the love of God that we should love the Lord with all our heart Thou shalt bind them for a sign upon thy hand there shall be frontlets between thy eyes in other words parents when our kids look at us you should be wanting them to see the love of God when they look at you not something scary not something that you know they're frightened of intimidated by but they should be to see the love of God and thou shalt write them upon the post of thine house now they Gates our love and our affection belongs to God our love and our affection Colossians 32 says set your affections on things above not on things of the earth amen do you know the word saved us in the beginning was the word the word was with God the Word was God verse 14 the word became flesh it dwelt among us and what did it do when it became flesh at when the word became flesh it it was only then that it could save us because the word was word before but it couldn't save us it had to be manifested love has to be manifested amen so we're in debt to the word Ephesians 5:26 says God sanctifies and cleanses Us by the washing of the Water by the word in other words the word washes us when we come to church and we hear the word you're hearing this word today that we need to be more thankful more grateful and that there's things that we have that we have in our life that belong to him and we're not giving it to him that word comes over and it washes us and we leave here with a determination to give God what belongs to God yeah we'll pay our ties we'll give our money to the gas when we buy gas we'll we'll give our money when we go buy food what about God what about God what about the things that belong to him the word continues to save us we are in debt to the word of God today and every day to keep it Jesus said if you love me keep my Commandments amen David said Thy word have i hidden my heart that I may not sin against thee I tell you what don't read your Bible don't pray don't desire the word don't meditate upon it don't long to please Jesus and you'll be sinning a lot more but you take the word into your heart say God I want I want you I love you this word saved me the word saved you people hate the Bible they like Calvary but they hate the Bible the word the Bible came flesh and saved us we need the word let's stand together what
