time for this day amen and this was planned how long ago this day i'd say at least six months ago this date and if it wasn't for this date brother stan and i would still be working on the but

given us here and we just want to dedicate it to the lord these these services and we want to rededicate our lives to the lord from to serve him in a in a greater capacity because we only got so much

believe amen it's such a time that we're living in and time of such uncertainty and the lawlessness that's in our nation the things that are happening that i'm i'm 62 year old and see things happening that i've never seen happen in my lifetime and yet it doesn't take us by surprise because we know that the bible and the message of the hour told us it would be that way amen so we see that as that's happening because he said it would and we know the other part of it's happening that during this time of darkness there would be light yes sir i'm so grateful that we know uh i was telling my wife the other day we were talking and i said you know i i don't think we really realize or really see how dark it is because we see light and the folks around us are just staggering in darkness and gross darkness upon the people and the insanity and what a privilege it is that we can gather here this evening in his name such a lovely place that he's given to worship and knowing that the what we're feasting on will not make us an organization nor will he make us a denomination but it will make us his body on the earth amen making himself the same yesterday today and forever i'm so glad that our our god still heals still moves among his people still giving the holy ghost still casting out devils that's right amen still call the people to himself and we're just kind of such an honor to be here this weekend and appreciate brother john inviting us and certainly been in a trial in the last year or so i know folks all around the world has been affected and yet we're still pressing on for the kingdom of god and so we've been battling all day on what to preach and brother john said he wanted to have a dedication service on sunday and maybe build up towards that and so he's just trying to get the mind of god of what direction to go for the services and so we're still struggling amen but yet we know god knows all things yes so let's just bow our heads for a word of prayer heavenly father lord we are so grateful this human to be able to gather here in your name and lord we just so thank you for the warmth that we feel in our hearts dear god that you lord have come in this hour and revealed to us your will and your word lord give us light to lead us out of this darkness father we thank you lord that in our time of need that you are our strength lord and the time of sickness you're our healer lord when the enemy tries to bind us you're our deliverer lord we thank you for that father lord i pray now dear god that you just come in a mighty way and as we start these meetings lord building up to the dedication service on sunday lord i i pray father that the words that will come forth will edify and strengthen your people lord oh god we're living in such a time and so many are turning back lord and going so many different directions but god we are so grateful that our souls is anchored in the lord amen father we asked your blessings upon brother john lord and this congregation and this lovely building that you give them to worship you in and lord thankful for so many years at the little storefront service there lord the building and now lord you gave them such a wonderful place and i pray dear god that a revival would strike this community that they wouldn't be one empty chair lord in the building dear god but lord that it would be such a stern dear god once more lord that you would move among this community lord seeking out for you said all that my father hath given me will come and no man shall pluck them out of my hand how grateful we are lord knowing that your word is true father we ask the signs and wonders to be wrong at the hands of the believers that this community may know that thou art the same yesterday today and forever commit these things into your hands lord for your glory we ask it in jesus name amen amen praise the lord if you have your bibles this evening turn with us over to the book of isaiah we want to read from isaiah 55 and verse 11. amen amen isaiah 55 11. the bible says this so shall my word be that goeth forth out of my mouth it shall not return unto me void but it shall accomplish that which i please that's right amen and it shall prosper in the thing where to ascend amen oh isn't that wonderful yes sir amen my word that goeth forth out of my mouth shall not return unto me void amen but will accomplish that which i please amen what god once done with his word amen god bless you may be seated this evening i want to speak to you for just a few minutes on no turning back no turning back the prophet of god said this he said now job was a man that carried out god's commandment to the letter exactly and satan knew that but he said if you'll just let me have him i'll make him curse you to your face so god told him he said now he's in your hands but don't you take his life now do you know why satan couldn't take job's life because god said so amen god said so he said you do with him whatever you will but do not take his life that gives us confidence this evening that no matter what satan tries to do to us he cannot take us off this earth until our daddy says so amen then my life is in control of my father amen amen no i'm not going to step out in front of a tractor and trailer and see if it's my time or not but if i accidentally fall in front of one if it's not my time i ain't going nowhere because we know that satan can only do to us what god will allow him to do can you say amen to that so god told him he said no he's in your hands but don't you take his life and satan even stretched that as far as he could on that he took every friend and everything he had almost his complete life but he couldn't take his life but job still helped right oc there was no turning back you see when a man or person has once ever really come into contact with god with that genuine revealed faith that god is not was not will be but is now a present it's god amen there is nothing no time nowhere to ever separate that man from his god i believe it was paul said there's no strife there's no hunger there's no perils there are living creatures or death or anything that can separate us from the love of god which is in christ jesus you are securely anchored in him amen you are securely anchored in him because you were ordained to that life yes sir amen friends we are not here by accident we didn't stumble into this thing but god ordained us for such a time as this yes god never put us here to fail god never put us here to stumble god never put us here to fight among one another but god placed us here to be a vessel that he can manifest his word through in the evening time that this generation will be without excuse amen you're here because you are ordained to that life amen hallelujah we are not here by chance we were born for a purpose amen amen i believe there are people sitting here tonight that was placed here on the earth to tear satan's kingdom down amen you know why i'm here tonight god ordained amen you know what you're here tonight god ordained amen but for the foundation of the world god knew every thought you would ever have he knew you would send her to like the color of your eyes the color of your hair where you would sit what you would think while you were sitting here that's the god i serve today amen he has not lost control this pandemic did not catch him by surprise anything that happens to us it's for our good amen amen amen oh my well they say well they'll never melt another bunch of brandon amounts they're a cult but i want you to know you can not fail amen we can fail no more than god can fail right now amen job stayed with the word because he knew the word would not fail and nothing can keep god's word from accomplishing what it was set to do amen amen god's purpose can never be defeated there is nothing that can defeat it amen so how happy we ought to be resting upon the beautiful revelation of the word of the living god that there's neither things present nor things that can come there's no sickness no sorrow no death no perils nor nothing can separate us from the purpose of the living god what god has imagined in his mind what god has purposed in his heart to bring the past there is no demon there is no power there is nothing that can ever separate god's immortal eternal plan it must be as god hath said oh hallelujah amen we know there's going to be a bride there's going to be a waiting supper served in the sky just as sure as there's a god how can you say that because his word says that and my word will not return unto me for it amen we know that those that's going to be in that wedding supper those that's going to make up that bride they're going to appear before him without spot or blemish how can you say that because god has ordained that amen they have the material on the earth now to make themselves ready well someday some happy day that's a good song but no not sunday today right now amen the material god has given us the material for us to make up that bribe thou sent at the wedding supper bone of his bone flesh of his flesh spirit of the spirit life of his life the mind of god operated in a body of the earth called the bride amen hallelujah hallelujah they have the material on the earth now to make themselves ready what do you say is simply this you are what you eat amen and we're feasting on the unfailing word body of the son of administration oh my it's not something that's coming it's on the earth now amen no turning back no giving up no going down we're going up hallelujah we have the material now to bring the promise of the bride of a rapture to bring that to manifestation that's right amen jesus stood up that day in the temple saint john i believe it is when he stood up to read and the priest said it in the book and he turned over to isaiah said he hath anointed me and he closed the book and said this thing this scripture is fulfilled he went into the temple he found the place he was read concerning himself and he read from isaiah and he said this day the words of the prophet has been made flesh and stands among you oh if i could give you an east tennessee interpretation he closed the book and said it's me all of the material is on the earth now the opening of the word to bring forth the revelation of who we are jesus had perfect faith because he knew who he was in the word amen and the word has been given to us to produce a faith in us that death will strike away from us years ago sister down south carolina wrote a song take a stronger wind than this it goes something like this strong winds are blowing with an unrelented force people running to and fro they don't know what's going on men's hearts are failing there's turmoil in the land church doors are closing preachers just can't take a stand but it's going to take a stronger wind than this to keep me from my promises it's going to take a stronger wind than this to turn me around it's going to take a stronger wind than this to keep this eagle down i would hallelujah i was born for the heavens amen you see the the church can only operate under the anointing that's been released for her to operate under the four living creatures the first three creatures were earth-bound creatures but the fourth living creature is the flying eagle and that anointing of the eagle anointing moves upon the people what does it allow us to do to leave the earth amen there is an anointing upon the bride to change our bodies amen oh hallelujah i just thought i was tired i feel good amen no turning back oh fear is go you see when you see who you are in the word it takes away all fear perfect love cast out all fear amen jesus when he was here he constantly told us fear not fear not even when jairus got the worst report that a man could ever get because i've heard it said so many times at funerals when a mother and a father buries her child and i've heard him say no parents should ever have to bury their children and jairus got probably the worst news that a parent could ever get trouble not the master anymore your little girl is dead but what did jesus tell him when the air went out of him when it seemed like all hope he did all that he could do broke every barrier to get to jesus and when he finally got to him and jesus said i'll go with you then came the news she's dead but jesus he touched him on the shoulder what did he say to him fear not he constantly gave us fear not i am he that was dead and i'm alive forevermore amen hallelujah amen i'm with thee always i'm with you always even to the end of the world the prophet of god said to calvary there that day he died alone he died friendless the heavens forsook him the moon forsaken the stars forsook him god forsook and his disciples pursued him everything forsook him and he died at calvary alone forsaken by man and god so that he could give us a promise in his word that i'll never leave thee nor will i forsake thee hallelujah fear not for i am with you even to the ends of the world amen oh hallelujah hallelujah the prophet god said he loves his disciples he loved sunsets he loved to walk on the shores of galilee and watch the sun set there he loved life god gave him life like god gave you life amen amen you love to sit around the campfire with the disciples say peter tell us a good fishing story who don't like a good fishing story give me a good fishing story peter sit around and laugh and looking upon his disciples he loved them but he realized brother george the only way they could ever live he would have to die right amen amen hallelujah and that's why on that resurrection morning when he rose he said fear not i have me that was dead but i'm alive forevermore and because i live you shall live also and yet people christians sit back and keep thinking oh my i just wonder i just wonder oh the prophet said oh my just turn loose get all things away from you anything that's negative get it away from you any doubt any fear move it away from you don't focus don't focus on the storm don't focus on the clouds focus on the sun amen amen amen what's your eyes on what are you looking on amen amen what's your eyes seeing look at peter as we preached this that brother jess last week look at peter he saw the lord come walking on the water in a storm with 20 foot waves and the sails tore and the oars broke and the boat was filling with water what a probably a category 5 hurricane something like that a great storm and here come jesus walking on the water and peter said lord if it's you bid me to come and know what jesus said come amen and that was just as much the word of god as let there be light [Music] and peter obedient to the word he stepped out of the boat and as long as he looked at jesus the storm the wind the waves had no power over him but when he got his eyes off jesus he started seeking and i say to you don't look at the storm but look to the one who walks on the water amen amen you just need to tell satan people all the time tell well satan said this and the devil told me this and the devil told me that my question is why do you listen to him amen you know he's a liar the bible said he's the father of lies well the devil i get texts all the time well brother of the devil i think why are you listening to him they tell you everything the devil said can't quote two good quotes about the only scripture they know is jesus wept come on somebody that's right but i think it's time we tell satan to shut up and sit down well brother we teach our kids not to say shut up we'll tell him to be quiet but tell him something come on somebody don't let him do all the talking you need to tell him listen to me mr satan listen to me i know where you come from i know where you're going hell wasn't created for me it was created for you you have no power over me and i am made out of stuff that don't blockade me and the things that i made of my material it did not come from an organization it did not come from a kentucky hillbilly the stuff i'm made out of it came from god amen oh hallelujah i'm made out of stuff that don't block that's what came from calvary stuff that don't bluff step aside satan i got time to listen to you i'm moving on for jesus i'm going on with my jesus anybody going with me let's go on for the lord we got no time to listen to the devil what's he going to tell you that's good in hell amen exactly right amen god will take care of his own you belong to god heavenly here belongs to god then what are you worried about he will take care of his own didn't david say i have never saw the righteous forsaken amen or is she begging for bread amen amen all things worked for the good to them that love him amen all things good and bad happy and sad mountaintop valley dark night sunny day all works for our good americans amen that's either true or nature amen if we um if we can act like we act when we're on the mountain when you're in the valley you'd see things but some people you can tell what kind of week they had as soon as they come through the door of the church well i know what kind of week they're having but you know i heard years ago i read a book about i think it was a jim brown football player wrote a book i believe it was jim brown called i am third he said my god is first my family is second and i'm third and in this book he told a story about playing football and he said that what he would do when he got there he was a running back and he would go through the line he said if they hit me and rang my bell and almost knocked me unconscious i would get up and walk back like it didn't even hurt and if i went through the line and they never touched me i got up and walked back like it never even hurt he said so that way they would never know that they hurt me because i always got it the same way and i thought oh god that's the way we need to be with satan if satan gives you a punch and knocks you play into the second row you need to get up and say that didn't even worse amen hallelujah all things work for the good to them that love him hallelujah no turning back amen i think of paul and silas preaching the gospel they was wrecking havoc on the devil they were ripping up his kingdom tearing up his carpet messing up his weak and the devil got mad he got mad and had him thrown into prison but not just in the prison back there where the big rats are the inner parts of the prison chained to the floor thoughts that i was beaten i think it was 39 stripes three different times gave you one stripe less than 40. because it said 40 shots will kill a man is what i heard one time so three times he was striped can you imagine the scars on his back and what were they there for not robbing a bank not stealing somebody's wife not for not wearing a mask they were there for preaching the gospel that's right amen and actually in my mind silas you know they had them there and chained them to the floor probably drug them in before they beat them unconsciously silas comes to himself and the world starts lightening up around him he feels the wounds in his back the soreness of the muscles he tries to get himself up and not exactly knowing where he's at the last thing you remember is paul you go so he just cries out paul paul over the next cell hears his name maybe just starts coming to himself and he pushes himself up against the bars he said i'm over here silas i thought he's going to kill us i didn't think that's ever gonna start being honest it hurts yeah that'll cool them off that'll shut them up that'll calm them down they'll turn back now they won't be so quick to go out there and testify at work now surely we're cold and hungry and beaten in a prison house i'm sorry i'm bloody amen who's gonna get us out paul what are we gonna do paul might have said something like this it's going to take a greater trial than this give me a seat for christ i'm one of them i'm one of them i'm so glad that i can say i'm one of them are you one of them i'm one of them i'm one of them oh i'm so glad that i can say i'm one of them get up in heaven god looking over the banister of time watching his children amen he just loves to watch his children in fact he's always watching his eyes on the sparrow and i know he watches me amen and i said some worry boy come here come here look right down there yeah all right look where was it what is that god said that's paul and that's silas where was it what are they doing god said look they're cold they're hungry they're bloody they're sore they're beaten and they're chained to the floor in the dark part of the prison where we said my god lord what are they doing down there god said they're having church amen hallelujah thank god for this beautiful place that we can come here and worship but whether we're here or whether we're down there or whether we're in an alley somewhere we can praise our god no matter where we're at whether we're on a mountain or whether i'm in a valley i can still give my god praise for there is no god like not god hallelujah and they began to sing the songs of praise and the bible said at midnight paul and silas prayed and sang praises unto god amen god said listen to that you know there's something about that family harmony like the lafontaine's here singing in a few minutes there's just something about that amen i was telling brother jeff's last week i think it'd be good to repeat it here tonight and uh silas you know being kind of we'll just say it this way maybe it's just kind of whiny you know about where they was at and what was going on he'd probably say tenor and paul being the church age messenger he probably sang lead and god he came down he sang base the earth began to shake the bars began to sway and the chains broke off their head and god said i have come to receive my praise amen and i say to you church no matter where you're at if satan's got you bound up if your back's against the wall don't give up just raise your hand and begin to praise god for the bible says i god inhabits the praise of his people amen when your back's against the wall give him praise when you feel you can't go on just raise your hands and say greater is he that is in me than he that's in the world amen and we can praise our hurt away and we'll just give him praise no turning back no giving up no shutting down we are moving all day man amen we live in one of the greatest nations all the history of the world of course she's in bad shape now but still it's a great place to live i'd rather be here to some of the places i've preached in i'll tell you that right now all right bro george that right bro paul amen hallelujah i was in the philippines one time they took the they took the seat off the commode who would take the seat off and i come out of the bathroom coming down the hall i found the seat they was using it as a picture for me and i thought god's truth i thought you know if i bought them a frame i wonder if they put that seat back on there so thank god for the nation we live in and up to now we've still been able to worship you in spirit and the truth and a freedom of speech but the prophet said the first thing you know is they'll try to stop all of this to take our freedoms from us and the prophet says it's so that's always satan's tactic in the garden of the eden he came to eve so subtle and they asked the survivor of the holocaust said how did you allow that to happen six million of your people was put to death how could you possibly allow that to happen you know what he said it was so subtle they changed the law here and then they changed the law there and we thought well next year they'll forget all about it there'll be nothing to it and then they changed another one he said it was only when they started making us wear a star to get into a restaurant it was only then that we had to wear this star to identify who we were that we realized we was in trouble the prophet said they're going to try to quit to keep us quit praying from the sick and to put a ban on it that you can't even pray for the sick but just remember when persecution rises the church comes to its very height then it's always at its best and let me say saints of god this pandemic has struck this nation it's made more bright people pray than they've ever prayed in their life it's brought people closer together when a brother would look out for come on somebody you've seen it in your church we're sitting in our church when satan comes in like a flood god raises up a standard against it amen and the pride of jesus christ is the standard of this hour but no matter what they do no matter what happens remember this god's working it all together for our good that's he said my sheep hear my voice and i know them and they follow me and i give unto them eternal life and they shall never perish that'll make you feel good neither shall any man pluck them out of my hand my father which gave them me is greater than all amen and i'd like to say amen today he's greater than all and no man is able to pluck them out of my father's head there's no wind strong enough there's not a devil big enough there's not a situation great enough that's able to shut this bride down we are god's covenant people hallelujah hallelujah we're not orphans we're not an organization we are a people who's been given a covenant by god and god gave this covenant he swore by himself because there was none greater to swear by amen you are the covenant people of god well i probably said i heard this today said god poured christ apart of calvary making the covenant swearing by himself and he took the body up into heaven which will return someday but the spirit he gave back to lead the church and the same life that was in christ jesus is in the church tonight by the holy ghost are you hearing me is the holy ghost here anybody here with the holy ghost that holy ghost you have is the same life he had amen amen don't let the devil tell you something weaker that's right it's not weak one faith one god one baptism the same life that was in christ jesus is in the church tonight by the holy ghost doing it acting and performing the same things he did when he was here on the earth amen amen when he was here on the earth he done these things and now there's a body on the earth doing the same thing amen what does that tell you he's here amen amen amen acting and performing the same things he did when he was here on earth you've received it you got the covenant you see brother sister we are the blood-bought children of the most high god amen a blood-bought bride in a blood-bound revival the same life that was in christ jesus is in the church tonight by the holy ghost he's just changed his mask hey man you know everybody wearing masks you know or we did for a while anyway and i was over so we're traveling stopped in to get some gas and something to drink standing over by the tater chip wreck this guy walked in he must have been local and when he walked in the woman behind the castle she looked over at him said well john you've changed your mask and when she said but paul how about shouting past potato chips because that struck me just like a boat of lightning you've just you've changed your mask don't you see what he done he's just changed his mask remember talked about the play that was put on his school and how that one person was three different characters but it was the same person all the time and the same god that was in the body called jesus the mask of jesus that same god is in the body of the bride tonight he's just changed his mask dude and acting this amen the same way he did amen i was over in cockwood arizona over brother chris longshore about three months ago there's a sister sitting there in service had a weeping tumor on her chest been putting essential oils and all kinds of ointments on it and so he was just giving some testimonies of some of the things i saw god do and then brother chris i was up in brother sean's meeting earlier this year and brother chris came up to me said brother i've got something to tell you said after you left said you remember i said yeah i remember he said a sister had a tumor on her on her chest a weeping tumor said she was in the service and i was just praising god as she was given the testimonies so she went home took off her blouse to put ointment on the tumor said brother daryl it was completely gone it disappeared during the preaching of the word the same god hallelujah that was here in the ministry of william branham is now here in the ministry of the bride will the bride have a ministry yes it'll be a great ministry it's the message of the hour it's the ministry of the hour it'll be so humble well glory people always pull back when you say that it's the truth it's the bride's ministry don't you see what satan's attacking right now he's attacking the fifo ministry amen same life he just changed his mask oh god was important to christ all crisis he's poured into the church amen christ is the mystery of god revealed but the church is the revelation of jesus christ in the hour she's manifested on the earth when the angel ascended with the book and you just said it with the book was the book shield no it was open when he handed it to john what did john get an open book and what did john do with the book he ate it so john and the book became one amen so if you wanted to know what was in the book you had to ask john he ate it well let me see this way i i like native american music i got just a little bit of enemies just enough to like it i guess but there was a i'm trying to think of this guy's name he's a award-winning flute player hadn't thought about this in years but just come to my mind he was raised in new jersey by a jewish family now how does a jew become a native american award-winning flute player i'll tell you how because one day he found out he was adopted and he wasn't a jew he never was a jew he was a sioux you can't make this up and when he found out he was a sioux he went back to his heritage before you hear me he went back to his roots and he started talking about the sacred way the red path he started talking native language because he was a native but he only found that out when the book was opened because somebody came to the house one day with the book and told him who he really was don't you see brother sister god has came to us with an open book it said you're not methodist you're not madness you are my bride [Music] and when we found out who we were we started talking god talk amen the prophet said it's written to you as sworn by god you cannot fail and that makes the devil mad amen i like to make the devil mad when you realize who you are then if realizing who you are makes the devil mad what do you think he's going to try to do try to keep you from finding out who you are amen there's no turning back for us where will we go only you have words of eternal life if you get down if you get weary we all do preachers get weary sometimes i'll be honest with you maybe i'm not well i know i'm not a great preacher i get weary sometimes i get tired but if you get down you get weary and it seems like everything's coming in on you do me a favor just open the book and go to the back of it and if you look in the back of the book you know what you find out we win amen and if you win the war the battle don't make no difference i may lose a battle now and then but i've already won the war don't come in here like losers you are not losers don't carry yourself like a loser i am not a loser i am a winner i am what god says i am amen shaken is the loser he's the one that's going into the lake of fire not me hell wouldn't create created for me hell wasn't created for you it was created for him he's going down we're going up amen amen hallelujah do you love him amen we're running our last mile home hey man you know when i was young in the army i read cross country that's a long time ago i was nothing to run 80 miles a week i ran the 10k that was my race the 10k 6.2 mile and i was with the 18th airborne court at fort bragg north carolina home of the 82nd airborne that's where i was stationed for four years so i ran across the country for my unit and my coach was a friend of mine named ernest hemingway he would this guy could run he was just some i've never seen anybody run like this guy could run so this particular race i was tired i started kicking too soon and got down towards the end i just about spent all my gas didn't have much left and i was starting to fall back people started to pass me and all of a sudden out of the woods i heard a voice it wasn't supernatural it was hemingway he had done won the race he'd already won and he circled back into the woods and he was waiting on me and when he saw me he'd begin to yell run one run don't quit now just one more hill there's a valley and the finish line is just ahead don't stop ward run run with everything within you and friends we don't have hemingway tonight but we've got a cloud of great witnesses that's telling you to run little bride run with everything that's within you we are almost old hallelujah no weapon that's formed against these shall prosper and every tongue that shall rise against the judgment thou shalt condemn this is the heritage of the servants of the lord and the righteousnesses of me saith the lord amen hallelujah satan gets to howling the prophet said he gets to blow in his poison breath and the winds begin to get strong says remember this eagles were built to take strong winds the harder the wind the higher eagles fly the harder the trial the stronger the wind the greater we fly in the old days do you know how they separated the chaff from the wheat they would throw it up into the wind and the wind would cause the chaff to blow away and the wheat was heavier it would drop back to the ground so the wind did two things it separated and it gathered and the winds of strife is causing a great falling away it's just blowing away the child but what's left and the eagle's a special built bird he's made up to go into the atmosphere he has to have strong wings to get up here an ordinary bird a hulk even though a hawk is kind to an eagle he cannot fly where an eagle flies his genetics won't let him a fish can go right to the bottom of the lake you know why there's a law within him that says he can do it right don't you try it without an oxygen tank you'll die but the fish operates within the law that's in him that's given to him by genetics and the ego flies higher he operates within the law that's in him that's made up by his genetics and the bride operates by the law of the word because her genetics anybody done their dna did you do yours i did mine i could go anywhere in the world build home i'm a hyde's 57 to the max i got stuff for me i didn't even know it was there five percent italian where'd that come from eight percent southwest asia four and a half percent native american one percent sub-sahara i come from everywhere there's no way i can be a racist well i said that to say this that you get fifty percent of your dna comes from your mama did you know that fifty percent of your dna comes from your mama and fifth percent comes from your daddy and that's why some people look at you and see your mama and others look at you and see your daddy when i was young everybody said i look like my mama now people tell me i look like my daddy my wife tells me i act like him that's but that's the natural so i got the looking the prophet said the natural top stuff yes sir so that's my natural dna then my spiritual dna 50 of my spiritual dna comes from my father and 50 comes from my mama now god is our father is that true so 50 of our spiritual genetics comes from our daddy and then i found the other day when the prophet of god said that i was birthed by the breath of god and drank from the breast of el shaddai so he said so you see god is my mother so 50 come from my daddy and 50 come from my mama then what does that make that that's on the inside of me it's just god it's all god amen and god operating in his body makes him the same yesterday today and forever doing the same works he did when he was here hallelujah amen when you really realize that god has revealed to you the truth of the thing there's nothing in the world that's going to defeat you in it you're absolutely undefeatable not you but the god that's in you not christ but the body but this word that was in him not mary but the word that was born from her not this this is not the overcomer it's the inside of me greater she that is in me than he that's in the world we are built by god to withstand the winds amen like the three hebrew children shadrach meshach of indigo there was a mandate given out that everyone would bow before the image which was an image of daniel the prophet or be burned in the fire and the three boys said oh king blow all the horns you want to blow pluck all the guitars you want to block yes pass all the mandates you want to pass we will not bow to the image some trusted jareds summon horses but we remember the name of the lord our god amen my trust is not an organization it is not in man but it is in the name of my lord for the name of the lord is a strong tower that the righteous run into and they are safe there is power in the name of jesus to break every chain so the king said all right we'll see what's going to happen to these boys we'll test that holy ghost religion out we'll see what it does we'll burn it out of them it's been tried they've tried to burn it out of the media man but you can't burn the holy ghost out it's fire itself hebrews 12 29 says our god is a consuming fire and everything satan tries to do god's fire consumes it amen they tried to pull it out of john but they couldn't blow it out of him with hot grease you can't pull it out you can scare it out you can't turn it out you can't run it out you can't stomp it out you can't put it out you can blow it out you can't mandate it out it's there to stay there is no turning back heated up the furnace you know the story seven times hotter than ever before the little king nestor nebuchadnezzar out there with this great robes and all of his rings and his big grounds watch this boys we're gonna scream now we're gonna watch them recant now we're gonna watch them bow now as you begin to hey boys you want to change your testimony you want to turn back now they might have said something like this old king it'll take a harder fire than this there is no turning back and in their haste to burn god's people they killed their own and let me say satan will destroy his old kingdom trying to destroy you but he will never stop this bride the disciples i don't want to see you that night when they were having a testimony service satan thought they were on their own that jesus was not around oh but he was around he said i'll never leave you nor forsake you and satan said i'll tell you one thing i'll get this bunch right now this is my time to get them i've got them right where they want them but he failed to realize that jesus was just sitting up on the mountain just watching his disciples testify you know prophet god said when you talk about jesus he always draws near you that's right we spent so much time talking about our fears and our faults and our failures and our weakness we spent that much time talking about jesus how much closer would he be to us sitting out there on the sea where george i think of you playing that testimony out there on the ship testimony on the sea satan began to blow his poison breath and the prophet god said the great powerful winds his poison breath hits the sea it had a nervous prostration and sin from satan will make anything have a nervous prostration that's the reason we got so many nervous breakdowns so the insane institutions filled up we've got people running through 30 mile an hour zones at 90 mile an hour squealing tires burning rubber off their tires turning corners go 30 foot and turn off it's a nervous neurotic state we're living in a time of phobias yes everything's a phobia they got phobias i can't even pronounce that's the truth islamic phobia homophobia people scared of lettuce that's look it up it's true people scared of lettuce almost have a nervous breakdown if lettuce gets nero look it up you can't make this stuff a nervous neurotic state the prophet said they don't know what to do all the way from the big house down they don't know what to do all the world is nervous and upset they don't know where they're standing they go from one church to the other church every little thing running here and there and to and fro it's because that satan has begun to push out his poison breath has begun to blow the winds of strife breaking churches apart separating brotherhood that's always his tactic that's what he's always done divide and conquer but i say to you brother sister do not let him divide us [Music] they'll try to do it by skin color if they don't work they try to do it by politics now what are they trying to do they're trying to divide between the vaccinated and the unvaccinated listen if you want to get vaccinated get vaccinated if you don't want to get vaccinated don't get vaccinated but don't divide yourself over something so petty we are one in the spirit amen do not let the devil divide us trying to break up brotherhood making people think they're a little bit better than somebody else that they belong to a better bracket that they belong to a better church there's only one church that's the church of christ she stands up on the unfailing word of god and when the winds got so contrary and the waves got so high and the boat was over waterlogged and half full of water and the oars was breaking and the great white caps and the wind blowing and that ship being tossed to and fro jesus sitting up there watching the whole time amen no doubt he stood up might have said something like this the devil gonna take a stronger wind than that and he stepped out off the mountain come walking on the water of the storm hey man there's things happening right now friends in this hour sin is uh the sin of this age the lawlessness that's in our land where people drive a car down the street one of us busting windows stealing stuff putting in the car just walking from card car and nobody's doing anything about it saw the other day where a woman was raped on the subway in new york city people stood there and filmed it not one person tried to intervene a lawless time an evil time a dark time but i want the devil to know no matter how dark it is it's going to take a stronger wind than this to stop this bride jesus said we're going to the other side then where are we going we are going to the other side let's not await wave high enough there's not a storm big enough to stop this bride god's word will come to pass my word will not return unto me void amen he ain't gonna win he ain't got a plague he ain't got a story he got a fire he got a trial that'll stop this for upon this rock i'll build my church and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it but we shall prevail over them amen amen amen hallelujah satan hates revelation but we love it with true revelation in our lives the gates of hell cannot prevail against us but we will prevail over them satan does all he can to destroy confidence in the word if he can get you to lay your word down he's defeated you brother brennan said don't lay your weapon down if he can get you to think that your words not good enough always good enough for brother branham's day but not good enough for our day the same anointing that anointed the prophet is anointing the bridegroom there's only one holy ghost he might have had it in a greater measure but you've got the same holy ghost amen but when the church dis oh i love this quote right here when the church disbelieves satan and believes the spirit's revelation of the word the gates of hell cannot prevail against her not him her god told moses when you bring the people out they shall worship me upon this mountain israel had to come that way there's no need to try to stop him friends god's done promised him you're going to go over there you're going to worship me on this mountain red sea barren land bitter waters nothing would stop them from going to the mountain for god said so they moved on just the same no turning back she's moving on friends but we are never alone the problem is the bible says let your conversation be without covenants and be content in such things as you have for he hath said i will never leave thee nor will i forsake thee jesus christ god's son who's the architect of the church he built his church upon the word of god it's written it's written it's written he built the church upon the word of god our blueprints is spirit-given amen and the bible says in psalms as we're coming down to a close the bible says whether shall i go from thy spirit or whether shall i free from thy presence thou art there if i ascend into heaven thou art to her if i make my bed in hell behold thou art there if i take up the wings of a morning and dwell in the other most parts of the sea thou art there even there shall thy hand lead me and thy right hand shall hold me up yes oh friends aren't you glad daddy's got a hold of your hand amen amen a few years ago my youngest daughter ali was up at rough ridge over north carolina and we was coming back and the clouds always come down it's real high you can see everywhere when you get up there and the clouds are always on the mountain so the rocks are always wet and we was coming back we've been up to the top we was making our way back down and i was leaning away and it's like a rock like this and i stepped off the rock down and i heard coming behind me was was alley and just as i stepped down she was about right here and i just turned around and saw her and i don't even know why i've done it but i just reached around and took her hand like this and i know sooner i got a hold of ali's hand that her feet went out from under her and when her feet went out from under her this look of horror would have went virtual on youtube i mean it was just all over her face the fear and the scare because her feet went out from under her and i just took her like this swung her out of down and sat her right down in front of me and all that fear turned to the biggest because she's only about six year old but all that fear turned to the biggest smile you have ever seen in your life and i said ain't you glad daddy had a hold of your hand she goes and down through the trails she went the saints of god in this dark slippery age of laodicea aren't you glad this evening that daddy has got a hold of our head when i'm on the mountain though right there when i'm in the valley the heart there in the good times thou art there in the hard times that are out there in my joy thou art there in my sorrow down right there in my despair there are there when i feel lonely thou art through yea though i walk through the valley of the shadow of death i will fear no evil amen for thou art with me you're never alone he's right here with us now the stabilizers have been put on the ship great fearful waves are out there before us but we know just beyond the waveguard that we're nearing the shore we're nearing the shore just stay stable just stay in the word stay with god no matter how you feel what anything else stay right with the words no turning back amen just stay stable when you see these great big old clouds around us and the storms coming and the atomic bombs and everything else that they're talking about our stabilizer is right straight in the word god said it would be here we'll crest every one of them we'll go right over the top of them yes indeed they can't sink us they can't drown us if they put us in the grave we'll come out again amen amen amen i heard the prophet of god say today the story about the insurance when he told him he said he said oh i have a assurance he said the guy didn't catch he said oh i'm sorry billy i guess your brother-in-law is selling the insurance he said i didn't say insurance i said assurance and then he said the second time i said assurance said he called he said he said well billy said that's fine billy said that that won't put you out there in the grave he said no but it'll get me out well that's true brother paul ain't worried about getting in it i'm just worried about getting out amen and you've got the material on the earth now that'll cause our bodies to rise again amen that's all there is to it there ain't no way in the world to keep it down there we'll crash every one of them our great chief captain is calling at the other side we're anchored in jesus the storms of life i'll breathe no turning back let the storms come let the fire come let the plagues come let the fear come let that come let persecution come no turning back we're pressing on he's here with us now we will crest every wave amen satan he loves the howl when he thinks he's got the upper hand he says we're going down he says we're going to sink us he says the pressure's too great the pandemic has put so much on the message people and people's not coming to church no more and this and that and too much division and this is happening and that's happening and you need to just quit and maybe you need to look on the believe the sign and don't believe it no more and look at this website all satan's trying to do blowing his poison breath but god says right you've already made it nothing is able to separate us from the love of god when they'll pass us through the waters i'll be with thee through the rivers they shall not overflow thee when thou walk us through the fire thou shall not be burned neither shall the flame kindle upon thee amen i saw the other day where a car went off the road struck a telephone pole called it burst into flames they burnt so much it burnt the rubber off the tires the man's bible was laying on the dash when they put the fire out of firemen i saw the video he reached in pulled the bible off the dash opened it up it wasn't even burned [Music] oh friend this word right here is in here amen hallelujah when i walk us through the fire that shall not be burned neither shall flame kindle upon thee fear thou not for i am with thee be not dismayed for i am thy god i will strengthen thee i will help thee i will uphold thee with the right hand of my righteousness ain't you glad daddy it's got a hold of your hand many are the affliction of the righteous but the lord delivers them out of them that's god's report so i say to you tonight saints whose report will you believe amen amen you're going to believe satan you're going to listen to him come in here and weep defeat it can't go on or listen to god who said fear

sword they go chasing after moses and if her god parts the red sea and they go over pharaoh's drive their chariots into their federal standard on the bank watch his army go in god swaddles him up he
