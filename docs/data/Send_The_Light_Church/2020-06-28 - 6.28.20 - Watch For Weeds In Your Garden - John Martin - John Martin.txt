free amen praise the Lord hum he's happy amen praise God let's stand together for the reading of the word I ought to say there there couldn't have been a better course before the word I wasn't asking the Lord for a vindication I wasn't looking for anything like that he just sometimes you just know but I had written this song sort of course to sing at the end of the service and to know that brother Ron had picked that a yes is it on your list amen praise the Lord well you brought the Lord with you he's here amen god bless you let's turn in the book of Ecclesiastes for one verse there please yesyes chapter five and this really wasn't even the the opening scripture I've been studying for a couple weeks now but it's the one that I wanted to read to start amen maybe we could just look to the Lord in a word of Prayer at this at this time before we read it Heavenly Father we're so grateful Lord for your presence today Lord you've made the promise in your word you've never lied he never failed before he said when just two or three would be gathered together in your name that you would be right there in the midst we thank you for being in our midst today Lord we also know that you inhabit the praises of your people and we thank you for inhabiting not only our lives and our minds that our hearts today our praise could come from the depths of our hearts Lord we ask that she would take control of our hearts and our minds and this time Lord we pray that you raise up a standard against the enemy who would come in and try to cause an unbelief and a confusion and anything that would hinder your word from bringing forth fruit in our lives pray that you bless each one today Lord we commit our hearts in your hands our souls Lord or we commit the service to you now receive glory and honor through each one we pray in Jesus Christ's name we ask amen please yes use chapter 5 verse 1 keep thy foot when thou goes to the house of God and be more ready to hear than to give the sacrifice of fools for they consider not that they do evil and God bless you may be seated I want to say it's good to have brother Samuel here and brother Bruce and sister Donna could make a pit stop with us because we weren't expecting this blessing but they had to do a little repair and we're just grateful to see them especially sister Donna it's been a long time yeah god bless you well we had a wonderful prayer meeting Wednesday did we know Amen it's good to hear that testimony from our brother man brother Ben as you know is come up most of you know brother ben god bless her is right here I don't know your name but God bless you sir mmm Chris god bless you brother band has come up for prayer many times and I just I'm so thankful to see God's grace prevail amen well a couple weeks ago two to three weeks ago something had come out of my heart and it is basically seeing how this coronavirus and how it will start with the corner virus but you know we've got all the riots and how the government's handling things the economy so many things are affecting the world affecting the nation but it's also affecting the believer causing many to kind of drift out of their place and it's cause they're real squeeze on people and that's there's really the very burden for this message today because I believe that we can't allow anything to get us away from what God originally gave us the word for so we want to title this message watch for weeds in your garden and for a subject we've been called to bring forth the word that God places in our heart we're going to get into the four types of of ground but today I just want to say I'm thankful that the doors are open there's many churches honestly that the doors are shut today it's a privilege for us to gather together we don't want to take it for granted we we want always pray that God protects us here and that the doors can continue to stay open but going to the house of God is sufficient for a lot of people maybe doing their Sunday Duty as long as I make it there everything should be fine but in this opening scripture the preparation of the heart is more important than simply going to church without preparation believers won't consider that they do even I want you to think of that statement without preparation believers will not consider that they do evil and if we're not ready to hear the word the word will not profit us in others we've got to better believe so why does the Lord want us to remember that we do evil when we get in our car and we're heading to church so we'll be more ready to receive the word sometimes we can come all proud I got it together I'm fine but if we consider that we'll do evil will be more open to hear more the gospel God has ample revelation to the humble and her Jesus loved us he he proved it at Calvary he died to set us free of Ephesians chapter 5 verse 23 says for the husband is the head of the wife even as Christ is the head of our church amen he has to he's that of the church but we have to allow him to be head of this church and he is the savior of the body therefore as the church is subject now we're subject unto the word unto Christ so let the wives be to their own husbands and everything husbands love your wives even as Christ loved the church and gave himself for there it is Jesus loved us he gave himself for us that he might sanctify and cleanse it with the watering of the washing of the watering of the word that he might present to himself a glorious church not having spot or wrinkle or any such thing but that it should be holy and without blemish I thought Calvary sanctified me Calvary made it possible for the Living Word to come upon you and wash you that's what Calvary did Jesus loves us so much that He gave His eternal word the Living Word is forever son in heaven for the purpose that he might wash as sanctifies cleanse us get is prepared for for a relationship with him for eternal life that he might sanctify and cleanse us with the washing of the water by the word so that's showing the importance of coming to church and hearing the word because there's a washing that takes place Jesus died to set us free but it's the Living Word or the life of Christ that really sets us free yes it's the Spirit of God inside the word that's being preached yes we can feel his presence here but it may not change us here so that spirit has to come inside our mind our hearts our souls and have preeminence he's the head of the church Jesus said in John 8:36 if the son therefore shall make you free you shall be free indeed yeah but how does this happen did Calvary do it all by itself why would we have to be washed by the word see Calvary played its pace it's parked and the full torment of Calvary does washes but the phone Tolman is the spirit that Jesus died now could come back upon the believer and sanctify us he get us ready for heaven of Jesus said in in verse 31 if you continue in my word then are you my disciples indeed and you shall know the truth and the truth shall make you free how many is a disciple indeed that means you're continuing in the word if you continue in the word you will continue to be set free now this is a this is this kind of goes against our our thinking like I'm already free what I have to be set free you aren't afraid he them the Sun is set free is free indeed but he's given us more of his word and the word sets us free you shall know the truth and the truth shall make you free my backside a lot I fall I sin you know what the devil has a way of not letting you know that you've done that but when you come and you place yourself at the presence of Lord before the Living Word and that Living Word begins to to deal with your heart remind you of certain things then we have a chance to release that and be set free from that situation is not just of our sins in the past right way past cuz they're though they're done forgotten right there does he forgetfulness but there's new things that God wants to deal with us now the Prophet said the Prophet Solomon said be prepared for the word of God when it's preached to you be more ready to hear prophet and our day said when we come to the house of God we don't know where we're really at that's another hard one to accept because we're every man's right in his eyes and he feels he's got it together and and and this is I know ROM Matt so it's a little contrary so when we come we come to find out where we're at not to gather new information it's all about relationship and the preparation of the heart before the word is preached is critical to the believer I cannot over emphasize that enough we want to watch for the weeds in our garden this morning we want to not only learn how to take care of those weeds but we want to be able to see them in seed form before they begin to grow right Matthew chapter 13 certainly what verse number one as a parable about the four conditions of the heart week we preached actually we studied on this in the past we've done a series on it but I want to concentrate on one of them that I believe is affecting the church in this hour we'll start with verse 1 the same day what Jesus out of the house and sat by the seaside and great multitudes were gathered together with him so that he went to a ship and sat and the whole multitude stood on the shore and he spake many things unto them and terrible saying behold a sower went forth to soul and when he and when he sold some seeds fell by the way side and the fowls came and devoured them up so it's almost like that didn't even do any good some fell upon stony places when where they had not much earth for and forthwith they sprung up because had no deepness of earth and when the Sun was up they were scorched because they had no root they withered away and some of them fell among the thorns is where we want to be focusing on and the thorns sprung up and choked them but the others fell to good ground and brought forth fruit some one hundredfold some sixtyfold and some thirtyfold who have ears to hear let him hear citizeness something how Jesus had purposely spoke in parables he knew some would have ears in some woman's he didn't speak in such a way that made is just plain for everybody so we've got to want to have these ears you've got to have a desire to hear what God's really trying to say to us people will come to church to sit down in the comfort or in the comfort of their homes to hear the word of God are not all the same Jesus being the Great Physician here shares four different heart conditions of the believers before the word of the Lord before the word is being preached right it's a condition to the heart before the word comes inside yeah we can see by this parable that the preparation is more important than making it to church putting on a tape or reading the Bible without proper condition inside of our heart the word will not work for us that's really really important it really just shines a light of the importance of our heart being prepared more more important than just while I'm going to pick up the bag I'll read it I'm gonna put a tape on to listen to it yes the word is perfect the word is pure and nothing is greater it's forever settled but the letter will kill us we need the spirit of the word and it's got to have Liberty we're going to look at giving us grace to get into it today we're going to look a little bit of the nature that God has the nature of God to I mean when you want to know something you want to know their nature have a person they are what they expect verse number 10 and that and the disciples came and said unto Him why speakest thou unto them in parables and he answered and said unto them because it's given unto you to know the mysteries of the kingdom in heaven but to them it is not given now God is no respecter persons but God knows down that our heads God knows who loves him and those who want to steal eternal life I can't steal from God it's a relationship you give your life he gave you a lot he gave his life for you but whosoever hath to him shall be given and he shall have more abundance but whosoever hath not for him it shall be taken away even that he hath therefore speak unto them in parables because they seen really don't see right and they hear and really don't hear neither do they understand and end M is for Phil the prophecy of Isaiah which saith by hearing ye shall hear and shall not understand and seeing as you see in the perceive for this people's heart notice the condition of their heart is waxed gross right you've heard of something that was well that's gross loo well Jesus looks at a heart than just so hard and wax gross their ears are dull of hearing that oh they don't want to hear their eyes are closed if they don't see exactly what they want to see less than any time they should see with their eyes and hear with their ears and should understand with their heart and should be converted and I should heal them see what the purpose of the word is to bring a conversion amen would heal their souls and but blessed are your eyes can you say amen to that for they see and your ears for they hear for a family I say to you that many prophets and righteous men have desired to see those things what you see and have not seen them and to hear the things what you hear and have not heard them yeah hear ye therefore the parable of the sower when any one heareth the word of God and understandeth it not then cometh the wicked one and catcheth away that means pluck or pull or take by force that which was sown in his heart this is he that receiveth see by the way say when you come to church you just don't want your mind to be wandering here and there and doing all this stuff because before that word really gets ahold the devil can just take it away from you yea how many times she just you've been to church and hardly remember what was preached when Jesus preached to those to walk into the mass he said did not our hearts burn within us as he talked with this along the way there's got to be a connection on the inside for the word amen that will has the ability to take away things that have been sown in her heart now that's scary it's quite simple if the word that was just received is it grasped and we don't see it with great importance we don't take it personally then the devil would take away and help you forget the very thing that was sown into your heart too often we're content with just listening to the word or just making it to church but the thing is this is not going to bring forth any fruit in our life make us good church members we don't want to be good church members we want to be ready for a rapture amen remember the importance of the preaching of the word Jesus said in John 6:63 the words that I speak unto you they are spirit and they are life so we've got to catch it we've got to catch the life of the word not just the the natural intellectual understanding of it but the spirit of it he didn't say my words are intellectual their knowledge their encyclopedia their spirit and their life something happens inside of a believer that receives the Living Word of God so getting understanding takes effort desire time sacrifice love it takes a great interest so that's we we that's our hearts got to be there to understand the word we just can't as a word and don't mean I don't mean this wrong sit there's a bump on a log because you're all sitting there and we're all feel like we can take that one I don't mean it like that but talking about the condition of our heart we've got to be involved because God's presence is Harry's presenting himself to you yes this isn't some seminar where we we learn about something no this is God dealing with our relationship with him verse 20 but he then receiveth the seed into stony places the same is he that heareth the word and a nun with joy receiveth it yes now you might think it would be good enough just to receive the word but it's not good enough the condition of our heart must be right before we receive the Word of God in order for the word to go deep inside of our lives because if it only goes so far we're gonna rejoice in this part but when we get tested out there we're gonna get offended if word doesn't go real deep you can't have a shallow relationship with God the word needs to come deep inside of us forever settled in heaven inside of us stony I don't want hard places remember what happened the children of Israel God blessed them and set them free they were walking out of Egypt Jesus set me free I was bound but Jesus set me free but because they had hard spots in their life they were willing to go all the way with God they got offended began to murmur and complained about the preacher they didn't quite like what was going on in church fact they were more spiritual than Moses terrible attitude verse 21 yet have he not root in himself but dureth for a while for when tribulation or persecution arises because of the word in other words it's going to happen they not live godly in Christ Jesus they're going to suffer persecution by and by he is offended now notice in this condition the word is received into the heart with joy but because the receiver of the word didn't think it was necessary to have their heart unhardened before the work was breached before the word was preached the word the word fell down into the heart but it fell on the hardness it couldn't go beyond a certain spot but if you get rid of the hardness before the word comes then he can go deep he also that received seed among the thorns is he that heareth the word and the care of this world and the deceitfulness of riches choke the word and he becometh untruthful right in this condition the word is received into the heart at church but because the receive of the word didn't think it was necessary to clear out the other things that were in the heart there wasn't enough room in the heart for the word to continue to bring forth what it was intended to bring forth yes we need to catch this the word cannot and will not grow simultaneously for very long in somebody's life it may start out that way but eventually I don't care what it is in there God will not take second place any of it it can start out that way but eventually the same desire that wanted it to be there in the first place would take over in the end I want you to think about that we let things in our heart we let things in her life and they seem harmless and not that big of a deal yeah but the very thing that we allowed in that we didn't think it was a big deal God says I am NOT going to share your heart with that so those things will always choke out the word now we know the word is the most powerful thing right but God will not surpass free more agency he will not undo your will for something else in there those things will naturally choke the word out and will never become fruitful we got to clean the heart out first it's God's requirement he that receiveth the seed into good ground see that here at the word they understand it it and also bear fruit bring bringing forth some 160 and 30 fold on this last day believe it or not we're just getting to the that was just the foundation I don't know what that is but I got to really work on my foundations in this last day it's the most deceptive in history the most perilous times of all ages in this hour Jesus talked about the two spirits being so close that most people can't tell the difference believers in this age are mixing the word with hearts that have been occupied with other things we think it doesn't matter because Satan deals with this outside of the church you if their heart condition is so dangerous and deceitful is because at the time the word is received the thorns are already inside of us yes they seem quite harmless innocent powerless gentle they can even appear non-toxic in other words controllable or they're manageable they're just little bitty seeds some tender plant you know maybe it's just buddy it's not a real big deal nothing to worry about got a handle mind your own business good I got a good relationship my god I love God always remember that eventually whichever word that was received from the Lord will never be able to come to fruition or maturity if you have other desires and cares inside of your heart those other desires and cares will always choke out the word so it's not a matter of course I love God more that's not it God don't want any of it there God only always living in me amen the thorns of this life will always choke out the life of God sure is anything thorns will grow and eventually choke us they may seem small and insignificant but they will take over our thoughts our time our desires and our actions they will just get a hold of us believers are mixing the preaching of the word with their hearts that are already preoccupied with other things the things of this world I just want to kind of break this one down a little bit I'm not okay if I can do this Jesus mentions first the cares of this world this age in this particular age that we're living in good bad ugly or indifferent anyway you want to slice it there's a lot of cares in this world yes that word cares means through the idea of distraction through the idea of distraction it means solicitude these cares are not necessarily always evil but they're still care of the sage and saint will use to distract you from bringing forth the fruit that the word had intended you to bring forth now these distractions could be things that are that are caused by anxiety yeah anxiety in our life now just think about what we're going through apprehension worry uneasiness distress of mine caused by fear danger or misfortune now that's just the word this is what a care could be it causes anxiety or concerned it can be an attitude of expressing excessive intended in other words you're just paying attention to something too much right makes you feel uneasy discs uncomfortable it now becomes a care that talks the word out even though we still say I'm a believer so did the children of Israel that came out of Egypt that's not good enough they should have continued in the word the word is coming for you to continue in they thought they had the main thing handled - they were out of Egypt fill-in-the-blank like it or not we all have a lot of things to deal with you probably don't realize it but Satan uses them to distract you they're more likely distracting you from manifesting the word of the Lord too often believers are content with just hearing the word making it to church I've heard some in church with a pitchfork spirit on them in other words this is for somebody I'm thinking about as if the word was mostly for somebody else I'm so glad when I can come to church there's such a personal relationship that I can receive from Christ you know there are people who would judge other people think about people to judge them but they won't think about people to wash their feet God has has called us to lay down our life for one another not pitchfork the word on here the word is meant to help correct your life it ain't for you to correct somebody else's life not to judge others with the word that you hear is completely for you to manifest more off that's what the word is for get in love with the word this morning amen God's intentions for speaking his word is for you to receive into her and to bring forth the fruit or the manifestation of that word that's why the Prophet could say we could never leave the church the same way that we came in we will either be drawn closer to him because we've received the word into her heart or we've rejected the word right and now his relationship with you becomes more distant God wouldn't do that jesus said if his word is sown into a heart that's already has other seeds the word will not prevail through the other seeds so it's not just a matter of I meant to church I'm receiving the word I'm real happy and excited about this this whole parable about the other things that's happening their heart that has nothing to do with the word that got preached it's those things that is keeping the word from becoming manifested of the Prophet taught us in this hour there is coming to squeeze we're feeling it I never thought it would be just look these thorns are choking the word they're squeezing the life of Christ out of us we need to recognize it the thing is all this that's happening people do not recognize it they keep going to church they become unfruitful right they lose their joy these are piece all sudden think you have a hard time loving Nick we is abounding they're struggling right they're losing their fruit instead of justifying some misfortune in her life let's recognize the devil is wanting to use this thing to distract us from the word that we heard in church last time we came we think it's not that big a deal buy what the word or just put a tape on right think about attitude you're having right now don't allow yourself to develop an attitude of an excessive attendant Asst about other things this news that we hear on all the stations of our phone or the TV or the radio will not bring you closer to Jesus it's not good news don't worry yourself sick about things don't let it cause anxiety in your minds first Peter chapter 5 verse 7 casting all your care upon him hate men just cast it on him for he careth for you yea what's he want us to do he wants us to be sober be vigilant be prepared when you come to hear the word of God because your adversary the devil as a roaring lion walketh about seeking whom he may devour Satan is she using it to distract you from manifesting the word is not just saying well I'm a Christian I'm going to heaven who's interested in manifesting the word who's interested in manifesting something greater in their trial than they did last week last month that's where God is at where are we at who resists steadfast in the faith knowing that the same things that are happening yes in your life right are happening to your other brothers and sisters in the world yes you're not the only one going through this misfortune we're all having misfortunes roll off the face the same battles but the word but the God of all Grace who have called us unto his eternal glory of Jesus Christ after that you've suffered a while make you perfect stablish strength in the center you see there God doesn't gonna take away your suffering why because through this there's a there's an opportunity for you to become perfect yeah to become stablish strengthen and to settle you place blows up I'm son solid ground today the word I can still manifest in this hour I just I don't I'm not gonna have time to read everything I just want to read this quote but the man said the end time eventually said Peter had a sword he pulled the sword he was going to cut the high priests ear off and the things like that he did but when it come to the real Christian courage he didn't have it he backed up and denied him is that right he could have cut the high priest ear off with the sword sure he known how to hand on but when it come to the squeeze and that end time to stand on the word of God he didn't have the courage and even denied that he known Jesus we need to become established strengthened settled and perfect in this hour we need a go on to perfection the word needs to become real to us Laurie O'Toole I'm talking about the spirit of the word the life of the word living in me now another thing that Jesus mentions is a thorn is the deceitfulness of riches riches in themselves are not bad Abraham job Solomon were good examples of that thing is these men didn't ask for it they didn't ask for it God chose it now I'm not saying you know we have not because we ask that but we need to be careful when you ask for riches because God odd gave them character to use it one thing that makes rich is so deceitful is simply the quiet yet strong desire for them that strong desire for them could be quiet to talk about it just inside when you have money you can buy anything you want so that desire opens that door a man brother first Timothy chapter 6 verse 6 amen brother you're with us amen praise God it's an order amen but godliness with contentment is a great game yeah for we brought nothing into this world and certainly we carry nothing out intent but think that will be now notice this they that will be we're talking on a desire I'm going after it hey that will be they're not rich it's just the desire to go after it they that will be rich fall into temptation and a snare too many foolish and hurtful lusts which drown men into destruction tradition yeah for the love of money right perhaps quiet yet strong desire for it is the root of all evil yes for which some coveted after they have erred from the faith notice they were in the faith but they erred from it and it pierced themselves through with many sorrows many sorrows going after something we need to be going after the word the word the word that we don't have not the word we have go after the word we don't have there's more of God to manifest we need to rise our expectation for more of the life of Christ in this that can handle the situation when we come into a temptation or to a trial when they have a chance to spread the good news that's all persecution another thing that makes rich is so deceitful is the snare we fall into as we pursue them it's a snare to go after them it's a snare what we go through going after deceitfulness of riches are thorns that will keep the word that you hear from bringing forth the fruit in your life now yes we can come to church and we can hear the word of God preached and we can say amen to it but that's just the beginning the hard part is going home and being able to live that that's what really is hard things keep that from happening that's what this is about it's the other things that are mixed inside our hearts they could they may not be a love for money maybe the cares of this life but mark 4 verse 19 talks about a third one that's not mentioned here in Matthew and he describes these thorns as lust of other things mark 4 19 if you want to write it down the lust of other things entering in this could be longings for anything leftover beside God that's what that means if you look it up there are so many things that the devil offers believers things that replace time that we used to spend with Jesus praying and fasting now we pray fast to have more time with those other things what about the time we used to spend praying with a burden not just praying now but also we have a we have a burden now something that the effectual fervent prayer and that's something where we can enter in or setting time aside to go out witness about cleaning and organizing the church helping the ministry or missions or supporting the work of the Lord what about the time we used to spend doing that and it meant something to us but now things have been slowly replacing that time that we used to spend with Jesus and believers are becoming more and more lovers of pleasures more than lovers of these things more than lovers of God instead of living for others and Nick Witte is bounding and the love of many is waxing cold right we must be careful not to let other things in Jesus ones first place not second he wants to be the Lord of our lives first John chapter 2 verse 15 love not the world neither the things that are in the world If any man love the world the love of the father is not in him see that's that's you know that's one of those hard things that every one of us would deny I love God you can't tell me different but you love other things Jesus is making a statement it's like the statement amazed he says if you love me keep my Commandments right I can still love you without keeping your Commandments God because you're so good to me see the devil has a way of getting us to think contrary to the word for all that is in the world is the lust of the flesh the lust of the eyes and the pride of life it's not of the Father but is of the world the pride of life the pride of life sound of the father it's a wrong spirit and the world passeth away and the lust thereof but he that doeth the will of God abideth for ever and his will is for us to bring forth fruit and then our fruit would remain amen turn with me if you would to John chapter 15 God has called us to execute his will his word presents to us the next step to take so that's why we come to church we're here to find out the next step to take not the next thing to learn nothing not the next revelation that's gonna make us feel you know puffed up the next step that he wants us to take he wants us to go on to perfection and bring forth the fruit of perfection John 15 verse 1 I am The True Vine and ye and my father is the husbandman in every branch in me that beareth NOT fruit he taketh away in every branch that beareth fruit he purges it that it may bring forth more fruit now ye are clean here it is through the word that I've spoken to you that this is what washes us today is the Word of God abide in me and I in you as the branch cannot bear fruit of itself except it abide in the vine no more can ye except ye abide in me I am the vine ye are the branches he that abideth in me and I in him the same bringeth forth much fruit for without me you can do nothing if a man abide not in me is cast forth as a branch and withered and men gather them and cast them into the fire and his burned if he invited me and my words abide in you ask what you will show be done unto you herein is my father glorified that you bear much fruit so shall you be my disciples now those are some really fine scriptures there we see the very heart of God think for his children in these scriptures he isn't happy with us just being his children saved and happy do as low as possible to get by first God expresses that if we're abiding in Christ if we're abiding in Christ and were not bearing fruit of his word right that he gives us then he simply is going to withdraw his joy from us you can see that verse 11 verse 11 if you want to put that up there shows that I don't want him to withdraw that's my life the joy the Lord as your strength so we can be abiding in him not bearing fruit God we see God wants us to bear fruit all the time not just saying the Christian now just say I'm in Christ but to bear the fruit second God expresses that if we're bearing the fruit of the word that he gives us then he simply is going to purchase some more because his heart wants to see more of himself in you he's not being unfair and everybody hurts when something gets cut off right how many who wasn't I think was Elizabeth when she was over at the house she purged some bushes that were bearing good fruit she purged him we had another tree that just looked like it dices wasn't bare anything as a snowball bush and Cheryl just cut that faint I like half off and now there's there was no growth coming in it's in the middle of the summer now there's growth coming out everywhere god knows what he's doing let the word have its way let it wash you let it cut off the thing that's choking out the word from bringing forth life the life of Christ we get so involved in these things in the world they're choking on us you know some people and they look at you they're so involved in what you're saying they don't even think about Christ now what's happening I'll tell you when I go out there and I see those bushes I want to see life I don't want me looking at something dead you keep talking about the world ain't gonna bring forth life and me yeah it's gonna roll in the atmosphere talk about something that brings forth life talk about how good god is talk about what God is doing for you talk about the victory you have talk about your healing and then talk about the promise you're holding on to tell me about your expectation think on these things talk on these things begin to act on these things yes God would you exceed me above all that we ask or even think of him now jesus said ye are clean to the word that I've spoken unto you it washes you verse already in Christ we've already accepted him as our Savior we didn't go out there and do some horrible thing but we come to church and I want to be washed when it come to church I don't want to hurt I don't want to hurt I don't don't want to suffer don't want to feel pain but in all reality the love that God has for us is corrective you don't want to feel corrected you love your hurt you want to feel loved you want to feel someone that wants to see himself in you and that's all he's trying to do yeah and that's the attitude that we need to have with the word that correction not like you know what I mean keep the word that he's spoken keep abiding in the word you don't want to let anything begin to lose fruit and if you're bearing good fruit you're on victory and you come to church and you feel like you got snipped a little bit why it's just good enough I'm good enough well yeah he's the Potter you're the clay he made you to bring forth more than you are who are you to say he knows he knows what's just you to the word learning to lean you know you got to be we should sing this song willing to lean we're not gonna learn to lean on anything if we're not willing to lean we gotta be first willing as the branch cannot bear fruit of itself except it abide in the vine no more can you accept you abide in me so we have to abide in the word I am the vine you are the branches he then abideth in me and I in him the same bringeth forth much much fruit Wow now the reason I'm reading this is we're getting an idea of what God's heart is for us his expectation as the father see his children not just happy happy children there's nothing in here about happiness a lot in here about fruit a lot in here about fruit tell me if you're bearing the fruit you've been happy that's right you'll be happy but the people don't have Christ are still looking for happiness fruit is what God's interested in a fruit is what other people see right I'll tell you if it's time to go pick apples or cherries we don't want to go there and see no fruit on these beautiful apple trees right green leaves new life springing forth no fruit yeah what did Jesus think about that fruit he wants to see fruit love joy peace longsuffering gentleness meekness temperance faith he wants to see you bring forth another soul go eat out somewhere in your life spend some time looking for someone that don't know him it's a fruit you'll be wise it went so wise hey that don't win souls ha's let's look at the endgame in verse eight God's endgame herein is my father glorified that ye bear much fruit so shall ye be my disciples he didn't say you're my disciples no matter what right you accept me a Calvary you're my disciple no matter what he didn't say that the children of Israel didn't come out and say hey look for your disciples we came out of Egypt we went through the water the rock followed us we all ate banana we all went to church the pillar fire we had all these supernatural experiences in her life it's not it you got to continue to bear there's every time the word comes every time you come to church there's a word for you yeah and that word now that you receive needs to become fluent in your life yeah the thing is it cannot and will not if there are other things in your life now we've heard a lot of sermons you've got to believe the word you got a Blee Blee Blee Blee and it's true you have to believe I'll never happen but you can believe and have other things in your life and it's just gonna eventually get choked out so yes we have to believe but we also have to make sure about those other things were you thinking about why we're here and what I'm saying by that is when the word is preached see I I don't want to know anything in your life please do not tell me anything in your life I do not want to know but I will love for you to come in the maturity to place your heart before the word and say Lord if there's something there that you want tub with right speak through the word and I'll know it's you that's what it's for it's a personal relationship it's not John against you John don't know you John don't want to know you are you kidding I want God I want God have a relationship with me don't get bad the messenger he just bring in the word and don't get mad where the message came from because he loves you Bryan wants you to bear more fruit man we serve a God who has expectations of us much higher than we're at that ride is going to be without spot or wrinkle or no such thing right when she walks others are gonna look at her and say I see a difference I see a difference in her walk yes not just what she wears but I'm talking about the ornament of a meek and quiet spirit I'm talking about a humility she's quote with humility it's about giving glory to the Father to her husband she doesn't draw attention to herself Esther never walked in there and said look at me - she did she acted like she was more important than what she was I got proof I'm already the Queen so do the Pharisees and the Sadducees so do the children of Israel when they came out of Egypt it's about maintaining the spirit that's pleasing to the Lord be humble before the Lord let the word have its way in your life amen well I just want you to know that were about 50% done and if we were to waited another week and probably were to went into a series Thorin's have a way of entangling our spiritual walk keeping us from bringing forth the fruit of the word that we heard in the past keeping us from walking in the spirit of that word thorns that are mixed with the word being preached eventually become a stronghold in her life yeah choke out the light the victory the joy working for the Lord a burden for souls we're in a race we need to keep running yeah amen let's stand together don't let the things in your life distract you from what God wants you to be doing don't let anything distract you stay focused stay in tune stay prayed up keep the watch those weeds in your garden don't let the devil tangle you up in things he that the Sun is set
