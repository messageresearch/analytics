[36:49] daily basis
[36:50] amen well god bless you let's stand
[36:52] together for the
[36:54] opening scripture here we're going to
[36:55] read in galatians chapter 5 verse 16.
[37:00] for opening scripture before we
[37:04] read this let's look to the
[37:08] the author amen i wonder
[37:13] if anyone here today has
[37:17] something in their heart they really
[37:20] desire god
[37:23] to help them with amen let's just keep
[37:26] that before the lord as we we go to him
[37:28] in prayer
[37:31] father we bow our heads before you
[37:36] towards the dust from which we came
[37:40] you breathed in your nostrils
[37:45] lord and you created man and
[37:48] lord one day we'll have to return there
[37:51] these bodies
[37:55] but lord there is a seed that came from
[37:57] you also
[37:59] and that seed is returned back to you
[38:04] lord we ask that you would forgive us of
[38:06] our trespasses that we've
[38:08] trespassed in in this body
[38:11] in our spirits and lord our unbelief
[38:15] we're not worthy to look upon the book
[38:20] lord we thank you for paying the
[38:23] ultimate price
[38:26] that we could stand here
[38:30] loving your word appreciating
[38:33] your word honoring your word lifting it
[38:36] up
[38:37] lord as much as you love thy word
[38:41] it's forever settled in heaven it's
[38:43] never going to change
[38:47] and lord we're standing here with this
[38:48] word believing the same
[38:51] lord now you saw the the hands that were
[38:54] lifted the hearts
[38:56] that had a need and there's
[39:00] no one sermon that can
[39:04] as it were be custom tailored to
[39:07] to speak to such a variety of different
[39:10] needs
[39:11] we would have
[39:14] lord i do believe that your word
[39:18] can minister to each and every need
[39:23] i pray that lord as they've lifted their
[39:26] hands and
[39:29] requested lord would you look
[39:32] down and meet this need help me with
[39:34] this need
[39:35] lord that at this present moment that
[39:38] you'd give them
[39:39] faith to believe that it will happen to
[39:41] the ministry of the word
[39:44] remove all doubts and questions
[39:48] lord help us to get out of the flesh and
[39:51] to enter into the spirit of the word at
[39:53] this time
[39:54] lord that we might see you in your
[39:57] proper position
[39:59] high above our problems and our
[40:01] circumstances
[40:02] high above our situations
[40:05] lord lift us up into heavenly places
[40:07] this morning to sit with you
[40:10] lord for you thou art more than able to
[40:12] meet every need according thy riches in
[40:14] glory
[40:15] we thank you for these things and ask
[40:17] your blessings now and the remainder of
[40:19] this service
[40:20] draw us closer to you and we give you
[40:22] the praise and honor for all these
[40:24] things
[40:25] in jesus precious name amen
[40:28] god bless you may be seated
[40:31] oh did we we didn't read the scripture
[40:33] yet
[40:34] i'm so sorry galatians chapter 5 verse
[40:38] 16
[40:39] this i say then walk in the spirit and
[40:41] you shall not fulfill the lust
[40:44] of the flesh amen god bless you may be
[40:46] seated
[40:51] we want to we'll be doing a little mini
[40:55] series
[40:56] on walking with god and this morning we
[40:59] want to entitle this choosing to walk in
[41:01] the spirit
[41:02] amen and this could seem like a strange
[41:06] title because who would not
[41:09] choose to walk in the spirit right
[41:12] we would all choose to walk in the
[41:15] spirit but it's not that easy
[41:17] amen because our flesh hates
[41:21] the spirit and it will do everything it
[41:25] can
[41:26] to keep from doing what the spirit wants
[41:28] us to do amen
[41:30] the next verse says for the flesh
[41:32] lusteth against the spirit
[41:34] and the spirit against the flesh that
[41:37] these are contrary to one another
[41:39] so that ye cannot do the things that you
[41:41] would amen do you ever meet somebody
[41:43] that
[41:44] was a little bit contrary to you you're
[41:46] a little bit contrary to them
[41:48] well this is the way our flesh is and
[41:50] the spirit is
[41:52] and in inside of us is both that's right
[41:56] and so there's a constant war going on
[41:58] and brother branham taught us
[41:59] it's like the greatest battle ever being
[42:01] fought
[42:04] paul referred to it in romans chapter 7
[42:07] verse 19 for the good that i would do
[42:10] i do not amen but the evil which i
[42:13] would not do that i do
[42:17] the intentions are there to do the right
[42:19] thing
[42:20] but there's no power in which to do it
[42:24] to walk in the spirit and to fulfill the
[42:27] good intentions
[42:28] verse 18 for i know that in me that is
[42:32] my flesh
[42:34] dwell with no good thing for to will is
[42:37] present
[42:38] with me i want to do good the will to do
[42:41] it is with me
[42:42] but how to perform
[42:45] that which is good i can't find it
[42:50] see it's not easy amen
[42:54] but yet a hard choice has to be made
[42:58] verse 16 of romans chapter 6 romans
[43:01] chapter 6 verse 16 know ye not that to
[43:03] whom
[43:04] you yield yourselves servants to obey
[43:06] his servant you are whether
[43:07] whom you obey
[43:11] whether of sin unto death or of on
[43:13] obedience unto
[43:14] righteousness so there's a part that we
[43:17] play here
[43:19] you know we're not robots right we have
[43:22] a choice
[43:23] in who we're going to yield to
[43:27] but god be thank that we are not the
[43:29] servants of sin
[43:31] but ye have obeyed from the heart that
[43:33] form of doctrine which was delivered
[43:35] unto you
[43:35] now here it is you come to church and
[43:38] you
[43:38] are delivered a form of doctrine
[43:43] you come to find out how to live
[43:46] it's a doctrine it's what we believe
[43:49] and it's your choice
[43:54] obey it
[43:55] [Music]
[43:57] being then made free from sin if you
[44:00] obey it
[44:02] then being made free from sin you become
[44:04] the servants
[44:05] of righteousness now i speak after the
[44:08] manner of men
[44:10] because of the infirmity of your flesh
[44:12] for as ye have
[44:13] yielded your member servants to
[44:15] uncleanness and to iniquity unto
[44:17] iniquity
[44:19] even so now yield your members
[44:22] servants to righteousness unto holiness
[44:27] isn't this beautiful i mean the bible
[44:30] just calls me out
[44:32] it just calls me out but yet it points
[44:36] me in a direction
[44:37] in which to walk
[44:41] it's one thing to walk with the letter
[44:43] of the word
[44:44] and it's another thing to walk with the
[44:46] spirit of the word
[44:49] it's one thing to walk with the living
[44:51] spirit and it's another
[44:52] to walk with the dead letter of the word
[44:56] now we're all walking with one of the
[44:58] two
[45:00] it's still the word
[45:04] but it's not alive to you if you're just
[45:07] walking with a dead letter
[45:10] it's still the word it's still the bible
[45:12] but it's not
[45:13] alive to you it's still the truth of god
[45:16] but it isn't quickening you at the
[45:18] moment now we're talking about a walking
[45:21] in the spirit
[45:22] is something 24 7.
[45:25] when it comes to walking with god it's
[45:27] easier to walk in the form of the letter
[45:29] than it is to walk in the life of the
[45:31] spirit of the word
[45:33] right amen the devils believe
[45:36] christ they know it
[45:39] they know the letter they know the form
[45:44] but the word isn't quick unto them amen
[45:47] see one is dead and the other is alive
[45:51] and i want to separate that today
[45:53] because we have the
[45:54] the the
[45:58] the false sense of the false comfort
[46:02] because we believe the word
[46:03] intellectually
[46:05] that we're walking with god and that's
[46:09] not the truth
[46:09] amen it's the furthest from the truth
[46:11] they're not the same
[46:14] they can be and they should be the same
[46:16] but they are not
[46:17] the same paul said the letter killeth
[46:20] but the spirit giveth life
[46:23] and times we can be walking with the
[46:25] letter of the word and really not
[46:28] the spirit of the word
[46:32] one can bring a negativity to a
[46:34] situation
[46:35] while the other brings forth a
[46:37] positivity
[46:40] one can be without the bearings of the
[46:42] compass in other words you got a compass
[46:43] but the bearings isn't working
[46:46] right it's a compass it's
[46:49] it's the word how many people went to
[46:52] college or
[46:52] what's a seminar studying the word and
[46:54] they're further away from
[46:56] god because they didn't have the compass
[46:58] of the word
[47:00] they didn't have the bearings of the
[47:01] compass
[47:04] but the spirit always is showing true
[47:06] north amen
[47:08] the spirit of the word is always showing
[47:10] true north america
[47:11] one has the form of godliness while the
[47:14] other has
[47:14] the power of the gospel one is usually
[47:18] searching for an answer in a present
[47:20] problem while the other
[47:22] has the answer because there's a
[47:25] difference between a dead letter
[47:27] and a spirit of the living god amen
[47:30] second corinthians chapter three verse
[47:32] two
[47:32] second corinthians chapter three verse
[47:34] two ye are our epistles
[47:36] written in our hearts known
[47:40] and read of all men
[47:43] not just some all men
[47:46] for as much as ye are manifestly
[47:50] declared to be the epistles of christ
[47:53] ministered by us written not with ink
[47:56] but with the spirit of the living god
[47:59] not in tables of stone but in fleshly
[48:02] tables
[48:03] of the heart this
[48:06] is alive it's alive amen when it's
[48:09] written in your heart
[48:10] it's alive amen when it's written in
[48:12] your brain
[48:13] it's dead right amen
[48:19] it's like uh doesn't every computer have
[48:22] like two different storage units
[48:25] one is a ram and the other is
[48:29] hard drive one is you where you put all
[48:32] the information and just store
[48:34] there and the other is what you're
[48:35] actively using
[48:38] right see
[48:41] the knowledge of the word in not in use
[48:43] is just stored
[48:46] he said i'll the spirit when he comes
[48:48] he'll bring all things to your
[48:50] remembrance
[48:50] he'll get it out there in the front to
[48:52] use it
[48:53] amen verse 4 and such
[48:57] trust have we through christ to
[49:00] godward not that we are sufficient of
[49:03] ourselves to think
[49:05] anything as of ourselves but our
[49:07] sufficiency is of god
[49:09] amen who also have made us
[49:12] you and i able ministers of the new
[49:16] testament that's right look not of the
[49:18] letter
[49:19] not the knowledge but of the spirit
[49:23] for the letter killeth but the spirit
[49:26] giveth life
[49:27] and this is why you can't just come and
[49:29] bring somebody the word
[49:30] in your carnal flesh you'll kill it
[49:35] it's the spirit of the word that brings
[49:38] life
[49:41] notice god has not called us to be
[49:44] ministers
[49:45] of the letter of the word now this is
[49:47] important
[49:48] because we always say word word word
[49:50] word word word what's the bible say
[49:52] and we we need that we need the word
[49:56] we need the bible but if we don't take
[49:59] the spirit
[50:00] of that bible that spirit of that word
[50:03] we're going to miss it we're going to
[50:04] bring more destruction than we'll ever
[50:06] help anybody
[50:07] amen amen so he's made us able ministers
[50:11] with the spirit of the word
[50:14] not a dead letter amen
[50:17] we've been called to bring forth life
[50:21] but we have to choose to walk in the
[50:22] spirit to do that we just can't say
[50:24] this is what the bible says that's right
[50:28] it's not easy for any of us it's not
[50:30] natural it doesn't happen automatically
[50:31] when we wake up in the morning
[50:33] or we run into difficult situations it
[50:36] doesn't happen just because we say we're
[50:38] a believer or we're in the message or
[50:39] we're listening to a tape
[50:41] we're not automatically in the spirit
[50:43] doing those things
[50:46] you have to consciously make the
[50:49] decision
[50:50] i'm going to walk in the spirit
[50:54] always remember you'll never be able to
[50:57] do that unless you
[50:58] first deny yourself now this is the
[51:02] first step that we need to take
[51:04] if we're going to walk in the spirit
[51:05] jesus shared it with us in luke chapter
[51:07] 9
[51:08] verse 23 you all know the scripture
[51:11] and he said to them all he didn't just
[51:14] say to his favorites
[51:15] he said it to them all if any man will
[51:18] come after me
[51:19] let him deny himself take up his cross
[51:23] daily and follow me
[51:26] this is the john martin version of what
[51:28] you just read
[51:29] if anyone is going to truly follow jesus
[51:32] on a daily basis
[51:34] they first must make the choice to deny
[51:37] their will
[51:38] for the day
[51:43] take of the lord's will
[51:46] which is the cross of suffering amen
[51:50] to do god's will is going to hurt the
[51:52] flesh
[51:53] and then and only then can you follow
[51:56] jesus
[51:58] because that's what he said in that
[52:02] verse
[52:04] up your cross study and follow me he
[52:06] didn't say follow me
[52:07] do this he says if you're going to you
[52:10] got to do this and then follow me
[52:14] the choice may seem easy to make but
[52:17] when it comes
[52:18] right down to it count the cost it's
[52:20] very hard
[52:22] very hard i'd rather just listen to a
[52:25] message just
[52:26] read the bible i just rather sit and and
[52:29] fellowship i just
[52:30] you know but that has nothing to do walk
[52:31] in the spirit friends
[52:33] this is nothing to do about choosing to
[52:35] walk in the spirit
[52:40] if you walked into a seminary
[52:44] and they're just classes full of
[52:45] teachings of the bible
[52:48] and be talking about god left and right
[52:51] but where would the spirit of god be
[52:56] but we can have our own seminaries going
[52:58] in our mind
[53:00] putting the emphasis on the word and not
[53:02] the spirit of the word
[53:04] the letter alone is not going to help us
[53:08] in fact it is what the devil uses
[53:11] against you when you don't follow it
[53:13] to bring the condemnation
[53:16] he doesn't use the spirit of life
[53:24] there are times that we think that we
[53:26] made a conscious choice
[53:28] that day to walk in the spirit but then
[53:30] we end up questioning
[53:32] with everything that happened did i
[53:34] really
[53:36] it can be even confusing a common
[53:39] example oftentimes
[53:40] we can feel that we're walking with god
[53:42] just because we're willing to defend the
[53:44] word
[53:46] this is what the word says but
[53:50] are we defending the word are we just
[53:52] defending our belief in the word
[53:55] it's two different things more wars have
[53:58] been fought over religion than any other
[54:00] reason
[54:02] people are willing to physically fight
[54:04] for their belief but
[54:06] they don't want to fight spiritually
[54:12] he told peter to lay down your sword
[54:16] you mean i just got to be a lamb right
[54:18] now all this stuff's happening at me
[54:20] yes so what happens when somebody comes
[54:23] and they want to
[54:24] knife you and talk about you and be mean
[54:26] to you be a lamb
[54:30] live that word yes live that word amen
[54:36] maybe you know we can say that maybe
[54:39] they don't know how to spiritually fight
[54:45] but maybe they don't want to take the
[54:46] training of the holy ghost
[54:48] maybe they don't want to hear lay down
[54:49] your life like a lamb
[54:52] maybe they're too lazy to die out to
[54:54] their flesh and choose rather to walk
[54:57] or not walk in the spirit but walk in
[54:58] the flesh it's easier
[55:00] you don't have to do nothing to walk in
[55:01] the flesh all you gotta do is get up do
[55:03] your thing
[55:04] get up and do your thing people are
[55:07] willing to fight for what they believe
[55:09] but
[55:09] are they willing to die out to their
[55:11] flesh
[55:14] we can find ourselves fighting many wars
[55:17] over what we believe
[55:19] even with our families and our friends
[55:21] our brothers and our sisters
[55:24] and if we're not careful we too can hurt
[55:27] the ones that we love the most
[55:31] galatians 5 15 says but if you bite and
[55:33] devour
[55:35] one another take heed that you be not
[55:38] consumed one another
[55:39] amen usually when you when you do
[55:42] something
[55:43] amen i mean if i'm gonna if i'm
[55:47] truly going to step on brother mark's
[55:49] tolls
[55:53] he's going to think about that for
[55:55] months down the road
[55:58] not his choice but the devil is going to
[56:00] keep bringing it to his mind
[56:03] you remember what brother john said
[56:07] amen that's just the way the devil is
[56:10] so easy to be consumed one of another
[56:15] too many of us want to prove that we're
[56:16] right rather than
[56:18] to be obeying suffering
[56:24] suffering is a word you have to obey you
[56:26] know
[56:27] everybody suffers but they don't suffer
[56:31] willingly
[56:32] there's a difference suffering for
[56:36] christ
[56:36] is willingly suffering for the devil is
[56:39] unwillingly
[56:42] first peter chapter 2 verse 20 for what
[56:44] glory is it
[56:46] will be buffeted for your faults and you
[56:48] shall take it patiently
[56:51] but if when you do well and suffer for
[56:54] it take it patiently this is acceptable
[56:56] with god
[56:58] your intention's right you do the right
[57:00] thing
[57:03] but somebody wants to judge you negative
[57:05] for it yes sir
[57:08] are you going to stand up and try to
[57:10] prove you're right
[57:12] are you going to take it patiently
[57:16] because if you take a patient that's
[57:17] what's acceptable with god
[57:19] that's the nature of god for even here
[57:23] too were you called because christ also
[57:25] suffered for us leaving us an example
[57:26] that we should
[57:27] follow his steps what was his steps here
[57:32] who did no sin who did no sin neither
[57:35] was guile found in his mouth
[57:39] who when he was reviled
[57:43] he didn't lash back when he suffered
[57:47] he didn't say well i'm going to show you
[57:48] i'm not going to talk to you anymore
[57:52] but he committed himself to him that
[57:55] judgeth righteously commit the situation
[57:59] to god commit your life to god
[58:01] amen don't try to be god
[58:04] don't try to prove you're right amen
[58:08] this is the example that christ left us
[58:11] that means we have a choice
[58:14] to walk in the spirit which is
[58:18] don't fight back we think the spirit is
[58:22] i'm going to show them i'm going to
[58:23] prove it by the word and
[58:24] get the quote out i'm going to amen
[58:28] that's what we think the spirit is
[58:33] the spirit of christ was at calvary
[58:35] laying down his life for us
[58:38] the majority of the time the only way
[58:40] people are going to see christ
[58:42] is when you lay down your life for them
[58:44] and you wash their feet and you show
[58:46] them
[58:46] that you love them beyond having to
[58:48] prove that you're right
[58:51] ii corinthians chapter 10 verse 3
[58:55] for though we walk in the flesh we do
[58:57] not war
[58:59] after the flesh
[59:02] at times we find ourselves proving our
[59:04] belief rather than defending
[59:07] our belief i want to talk about
[59:10] defending
[59:11] what you believe right because we got to
[59:15] defend what we believe
[59:17] we gotta we gotta take a stand for what
[59:20] we believe
[59:22] you don't defend your belief by proving
[59:24] you're right all the time
[59:26] we've just got to get that off the table
[59:29] get it off the table amen
[59:31] you defend your belief by living by
[59:34] demonstrating
[59:36] and by manifesting the spirit of the
[59:38] word
[59:39] amen that's how you do it amen
[59:43] that ain't easy you got to die out to
[59:47] the flesh
[59:48] the flesh can't be involved verse 4 for
[59:51] the weapons of our warfare are not
[59:53] carnal
[59:54] but mighty through god to the pulling
[59:56] down of strongholds
[59:58] casting down imaginations and every high
[1:00:00] thing that exalteth itself
[1:00:03] against the knowledge of god
[1:00:06] and bringing into captivity every
[1:00:08] thought
[1:00:10] to obedience
[1:00:14] to you becoming obedient to what you
[1:00:16] need to do in the middle of your battle
[1:00:20] when you're in the battle what's really
[1:00:22] important is your obedience
[1:00:25] not proving your right
[1:00:29] obedient to what the spirit is leading
[1:00:32] you to do
[1:00:33] amen and having a readiness to revenge
[1:00:37] all disobedience when your obedience is
[1:00:39] fulfilled
[1:00:40] right obviously if somebody's lashing
[1:00:42] out against you
[1:00:44] there's disobedience right there you
[1:00:46] want to revenge that
[1:00:47] your flesh wants to rise up and and put
[1:00:49] it in its place
[1:00:51] but the spirit walking in the spirit
[1:00:54] says
[1:00:55] you become obedient and you'll put that
[1:00:57] thing it's a soft answer that turns away
[1:00:59] wrath
[1:01:00] it's laying down your life that's going
[1:01:02] to make a difference that
[1:01:03] people are going to see you manifestly
[1:01:05] declaring the life of christ in that
[1:01:08] situation
[1:01:12] we just need to fulfill our obedience to
[1:01:14] the word
[1:01:16] and not defend our belief right amen
[1:01:19] live our belief second corinthians
[1:01:23] chapter
[1:01:24] six verse three second corinthians
[1:01:26] chapter six verse three giving
[1:01:28] no offense in anything
[1:01:32] that the ministry be not blamed
[1:01:35] you do not defend
[1:01:38] the word with offense
[1:01:46] god has called us to the defense of the
[1:01:49] gospel
[1:01:50] not the offense your offense goes by you
[1:01:54] laying down your life
[1:01:56] for others that's right be a missionary
[1:02:00] go out wash somebody's feet give them
[1:02:02] the good news
[1:02:06] but when it comes to to dealing with
[1:02:09] problems
[1:02:10] you don't go on the offense put the
[1:02:14] person in their place
[1:02:20] god doesn't do anything through
[1:02:22] manipulation
[1:02:24] everything has to go through free more
[1:02:26] agency so how in the world
[1:02:28] is god going to accept you trying to
[1:02:30] manipulate somebody
[1:02:31] manipulate somebody to believe your way
[1:02:33] of thinking
[1:02:35] he's not going to honor that
[1:02:40] but in all things approving ourselves
[1:02:44] now you have a chance to prove yourself
[1:02:46] right here isn't this cool
[1:02:48] that you can prove yourself
[1:02:51] as the ministers of god how you gonna do
[1:02:54] it
[1:02:55] in much patience
[1:02:59] in affliction you're gonna prove it in
[1:03:02] necessities
[1:03:03] you're gonna prove it in distress
[1:03:06] this is how you prove it you prove it in
[1:03:08] stripes
[1:03:10] imprisonments and turmoils in labors and
[1:03:13] watches
[1:03:14] in fascists this is how you prove it
[1:03:19] not by you bullying your way putting
[1:03:22] somebody in their place
[1:03:24] we demonstrate our ministry and all
[1:03:26] these situations and all the problems in
[1:03:28] our life
[1:03:30] but how do we do it by pureness
[1:03:36] by knowledge by long-suffering
[1:03:40] by kindness by
[1:03:45] choosing to walk in the holy ghost
[1:03:48] amen by
[1:03:52] love right on
[1:03:55] vain amen in other words it's
[1:03:58] truly and genuinely the pure love of god
[1:04:01] right amen amen by the word of truth
[1:04:07] by the power of god by the arm of
[1:04:10] righteousness
[1:04:12] on the right hand and on the left right
[1:04:16] so you prove your ministry with problem
[1:04:19] situations
[1:04:21] yes and you do it
[1:04:24] by the pureness and the power of the
[1:04:28] holy
[1:04:28] spirit
[1:04:32] walking in the spirit much different
[1:04:37] than how we take care of problems
[1:04:42] and that's what i'm trying to say a lot
[1:04:43] of times we think
[1:04:45] we're walking in the spirit because
[1:04:47] we're defending the word
[1:04:50] but frankly we don't even know how to
[1:04:52] defend the word amen
[1:04:56] this bible shows us how to stand for the
[1:04:59] word
[1:04:59] amen how to demonstrate the spirit of
[1:05:03] the word that lives inside of you amen
[1:05:05] anybody can judge you know who's the
[1:05:08] greatest judge is the devil
[1:05:10] he was so bold to even judge god that he
[1:05:13] was wrong
[1:05:16] he's the accuser of the brethren he
[1:05:18] knows how to judge
[1:05:19] he tells me all my faults amen brings
[1:05:22] them to my memory
[1:05:23] amen even things that are under the
[1:05:25] blood
[1:05:27] he's the judge of judges
[1:05:30] and he tries to get us to have the same
[1:05:33] spirit
[1:05:34] of judging others putting others in
[1:05:37] their place
[1:05:39] and when we do that we must realize that
[1:05:42] we haven't
[1:05:43] chose to walk in the spirit amen
[1:05:47] it's one thing to stand for the word
[1:05:49] it's other things to stand for the
[1:05:50] spirit of the word
[1:05:53] let's take a look at ephesians chapter 4
[1:05:55] verse 15 but speak
[1:05:56] the truth in love
[1:06:00] speak the truth in love may grow up
[1:06:03] into him in all things which is that
[1:06:06] even
[1:06:06] christ most people
[1:06:10] speak the truth without the spirit
[1:06:13] of truth yes sir
[1:06:16] most people speak the truth without the
[1:06:18] spirit of truth
[1:06:20] and you don't have the spirit of truth
[1:06:22] you don't have you're not going to speak
[1:06:23] the truth
[1:06:24] in love you're just going to speak the
[1:06:27] truth
[1:06:28] and you're going to stand there like
[1:06:29] those that caught that woman
[1:06:31] in adultery and say isn't this what the
[1:06:34] what the word says
[1:06:36] am i telling you the word and then what
[1:06:38] moses said is it what the prophet
[1:06:40] william branham said why is it
[1:06:47] why is it that they want to speak the
[1:06:50] word
[1:06:51] without the spirit of the word because
[1:06:54] the spirit that's on them
[1:06:56] wants to manipulate the situation
[1:06:59] to prove something
[1:07:05] to prove a point to dominate to esteem
[1:07:07] themselves better
[1:07:08] looking for vain glory there could be a
[1:07:10] number of fleshly colonel reasons
[1:07:14] but when you speak the truth with the
[1:07:16] spirit of truth
[1:07:17] you will always be speaking in love
[1:07:21] because even jesus said as many as i
[1:07:22] love i rebuke
[1:07:24] now chasten he wants to turn
[1:07:28] us around
[1:07:31] he may tell us we're heading straight to
[1:07:33] hell and it may not be a good feeling
[1:07:37] but at least he tells us where the
[1:07:38] door's at
[1:07:41] and our conversation is always supposed
[1:07:43] to be with grace
[1:07:44] right not judgment grace coupled with
[1:07:47] fear
[1:07:47] always showing a way of escape
[1:07:50] that's speaking the truth in love amen
[1:07:53] we don't want to hold back the truth
[1:07:56] but we just want to speak it in love
[1:07:59] amen
[1:08:00] another supporting scripture we can find
[1:08:01] here in second thessalonians
[1:08:03] chapter 2 verse 7.
[1:08:07] ii thessalonians chapter 2 verse 7 for
[1:08:09] the mystery of iniquity
[1:08:11] doth already work
[1:08:15] only he who now letteth will let
[1:08:18] until he be taken out of the way
[1:08:22] and then shall the wicked be revealed
[1:08:25] whom the lord will shall consume with
[1:08:27] the spirit of his mouth and shall
[1:08:29] destroy
[1:08:29] with the brightness of his coming notice
[1:08:32] how the wicked is going to be destroyed
[1:08:37] the spirit
[1:08:40] of his mouth and of course it's the word
[1:08:44] of god
[1:08:45] but the point that i'm trying to say is
[1:08:47] we don't want the form of the word
[1:08:50] we want the life of the word amen amen
[1:08:53] even him who's coming is after the
[1:08:55] working of satan
[1:08:57] with all powers and signs and lying
[1:09:01] wonders now notice satan
[1:09:07] this this person is coming after the
[1:09:09] working of satan so this is in other
[1:09:11] words
[1:09:11] he mimics satan we know this is the
[1:09:13] antichrist
[1:09:15] he's got power he's got signs he's got
[1:09:18] line wonders
[1:09:20] but our theme here is the mystery
[1:09:24] of iniquity verse 10 and also
[1:09:27] with all deceivableness of
[1:09:29] unrighteousness in them that perish
[1:09:32] because they receive not the love of the
[1:09:34] truth
[1:09:36] that they might be saved i'm going to
[1:09:39] tell you what's really important when we
[1:09:40] come to church
[1:09:42] is to honestly love the word that's
[1:09:44] being preached
[1:09:48] because if we don't love the word
[1:09:54] bad things happen for this cause
[1:09:58] god shall send them strong delusions
[1:10:00] that they should believe a lie
[1:10:02] that they all might be damned who
[1:10:03] believe not the truth but had pleasure
[1:10:05] and unrighteousness
[1:10:08] there are people that may have received
[1:10:09] the knowledge of the word but not the
[1:10:11] spirit of the word
[1:10:14] so the devil's believe
[1:10:18] that they don't have a love for the
[1:10:19] truth
[1:10:22] at the same time that they believe they
[1:10:24] also hold
[1:10:25] iniquity i want to talk just a few
[1:10:28] minutes about the mystery
[1:10:29] of iniquity because to be honest friends
[1:10:32] we all have iniquity in our lives we're
[1:10:35] sitting here
[1:10:36] we're standing here we all have iniquity
[1:10:39] in our lives
[1:10:40] now by the grace of god i trust that
[1:10:42] you've asked the blood of jesus christ
[1:10:43] to cleanse you before under his
[1:10:45] sanctuary
[1:10:46] but the thing is it don't take long
[1:10:48] before iniquity sets back in
[1:10:50] i want to talk to you about the mystery
[1:10:51] there's a mystery with iniquity
[1:10:54] iniquity will keep us from walking
[1:10:57] intimately
[1:10:58] with god amen if we're going to choose
[1:11:01] daily to walk in the spirit
[1:11:03] we're going to need to pray to pray that
[1:11:06] iniquity would not be in us
[1:11:08] and to pay special attention to this
[1:11:10] mystery that works inside of us
[1:11:13] iniquity was first found in lucifer
[1:11:16] ezekiel chapter 28 verse 15 says thou
[1:11:19] was perfect in thy ways from the day
[1:11:21] that that was created
[1:11:22] till iniquity was found in thee
[1:11:27] iniquity came after
[1:11:31] iniquity set in when choice was given
[1:11:40] i have a i planted trees i plant all
[1:11:42] sorts of trees
[1:11:44] plants you've all been planters anything
[1:11:46] that you planted
[1:11:47] it's still if it's alive it's still the
[1:11:49] same thing that you planted
[1:11:55] and i planted a lot of evergreens i play
[1:11:57] a lot of plants
[1:11:59] and every time i go there i can have an
[1:12:01] expectation
[1:12:04] those are willows those willows are
[1:12:06] still there
[1:12:08] they're still dropping their branches
[1:12:13] they don't change but free more agency
[1:12:17] has a chance to change
[1:12:24] lucifer knew to keep god first in his
[1:12:27] life
[1:12:28] but he decided in his heart to do his
[1:12:31] own
[1:12:32] will instead so he did he wanted to do
[1:12:35] his
[1:12:36] own will instead of god's lucifer was
[1:12:39] created
[1:12:40] to do god's will in fact all things were
[1:12:43] created for him
[1:12:44] by him for him to bring him pleasure
[1:12:48] honor glory everything that
[1:12:51] is that we see was created for god
[1:12:56] not just by god to do whatever they
[1:12:57] wanted to do
[1:12:59] amen for god and to bring him glory
[1:13:04] he said i will ascend i will exalt my
[1:13:07] will
[1:13:08] above god's will for my life
[1:13:11] it's the same thing that the spirit of
[1:13:15] the devil taught eve to do
[1:13:17] to the most subtle beast
[1:13:20] the tree of knowledge of good and evil
[1:13:23] it's the knowledge of good but choosing
[1:13:26] to do
[1:13:27] your will instead that's the evil
[1:13:33] that's it just trying to keep it simple
[1:13:36] what did brother branham teach us that
[1:13:38] iniquity was knowing the will of god
[1:13:41] knowing what you should be doing and not
[1:13:43] doing it
[1:13:46] evil is simply knowing the right thing
[1:13:49] and not doing it we're talking about the
[1:13:51] mystery of iniquity that
[1:13:52] does already work lucifer had charisma
[1:14:00] he probably was the pinnacle
[1:14:03] of charisma
[1:14:07] with his charisma he was able to get a
[1:14:09] third of the angels on board with his
[1:14:11] idea
[1:14:14] then to get the most subtle beast on
[1:14:17] board
[1:14:18] then to get eve on board with his idea
[1:14:21] and from there satan was able to worm
[1:14:23] his way into the nature of man
[1:14:26] and every man that's born is born with
[1:14:28] the satanic nature
[1:14:30] of knowing what's right but choosing not
[1:14:33] to do it
[1:14:36] and that's why a man must be born again
[1:14:39] a different nature
[1:14:40] amen david said in psalms 51 verse 5
[1:14:43] behold
[1:14:44] i was shapen in iniquity
[1:14:47] in sin did my mother conceive me
[1:14:50] we go through life shaping
[1:14:55] take a piece of wood you whittle it down
[1:14:57] you you're shaping it
[1:14:59] take a piece of steel whittle it down
[1:15:01] you're shaping it
[1:15:04] you take a little child you bring them
[1:15:06] up in the way you should go
[1:15:07] right you're shaping them that's right
[1:15:11] then the catholic church say give me a
[1:15:12] child so he's five years old and
[1:15:15] everything will be fine there's
[1:15:17] something about shaping in the word
[1:15:21] we need the word we need to be shapen by
[1:15:23] god
[1:15:24] our own nature if you just watch this
[1:15:27] world is going in utter destruction why
[1:15:29] it's because it's not listening to god
[1:15:33] it's doing its own thing amen
[1:15:36] man the bible says that man's gonna end
[1:15:38] up destroying himself
[1:15:39] amen he listens to the devil he listens
[1:15:43] to his own nature he doesn't uh
[1:15:46] think he needs to do what god tells him
[1:15:49] to do he's just gonna do his own thing
[1:15:53] now lucifer didn't stop there
[1:15:57] iniquity has piled up inside the
[1:16:00] churches
[1:16:03] where people are trying to get back to
[1:16:04] god you'll find iniquity there
[1:16:08] but satan has convinced them that they
[1:16:11] can still have
[1:16:12] god and still do their will
[1:16:18] this is the mystery of iniquity
[1:16:21] ezekiel 28 verse 18 thou has defiled thy
[1:16:25] sanctuaries by the multitude
[1:16:30] of iniquities and by the iniquity
[1:16:34] of thy traffic and of course when you
[1:16:36] think of traffic you're thinking there's
[1:16:37] a lot of
[1:16:38] cars right
[1:16:41] well iniquity is the same thing
[1:16:45] a lot of iniquity did not jesus say
[1:16:49] because iniquity would abound in the
[1:16:51] last days
[1:16:53] that the love of many would wax cold yes
[1:16:56] iniquities just simply not robbing banks
[1:16:59] now
[1:16:59] right not killing people just not doing
[1:17:03] what the lord wants you to do doing his
[1:17:05] will
[1:17:07] now this is the john martin definition
[1:17:09] of the mystery of iniquity
[1:17:12] it is that a person feels safe with
[1:17:14] having the knowledge of truth
[1:17:16] without the spirit of truth to obey it
[1:17:23] i got this truth i got this knowledge
[1:17:27] and you feel good that you have it and
[1:17:29] you call it a revelation
[1:17:34] and you don't even question yourself
[1:17:35] when you're not manifesting it it's
[1:17:37] still a revelation
[1:17:41] it's the mystery of a negative doth
[1:17:43] already work
[1:17:44] it's already working we were shaping in
[1:17:47] it
[1:17:47] amen just brings that whole thing into
[1:17:50] the church and said
[1:17:52] well you know as long as you do this
[1:17:54] you're okay
[1:17:58] that's why you can't tell a lot of
[1:17:59] people things
[1:18:01] because it the iniquity the spirit of
[1:18:03] iniquity is so strong in a person's life
[1:18:08] it's already working in the churches
[1:18:13] iniquity is inside the people who choose
[1:18:16] to let it remain it's true
[1:18:21] right for the mystery does already work
[1:18:25] only
[1:18:26] he who now let us will let
[1:18:29] until he be taken out of the way
[1:18:32] see we have a choice in the matter we
[1:18:35] can
[1:18:36] let it remain or we can get serious
[1:18:39] about it
[1:18:43] now you're not responsible for my
[1:18:44] iniquity and i'm not responsible for
[1:18:47] yours
[1:18:49] but we're all on the same path here the
[1:18:51] same plane
[1:18:52] i have a choice to make with iniquity in
[1:18:54] my life and you have a choice
[1:18:57] with iniquity in your life are you going
[1:18:58] to let it remain
[1:19:00] right now because eventually it's going
[1:19:03] to be taken out of the way he's shaking
[1:19:04] heaven and earth
[1:19:05] right amen he yes
[1:19:08] it's up to us to get serious about
[1:19:10] walking in the spirit
[1:19:11] amen amen you're not going to hold
[1:19:14] iniquity
[1:19:15] inside and walk in the spirit
[1:19:18] come on he's calling us to make a choice
[1:19:21] to walk into spirit
[1:19:22] that means we have to do something about
[1:19:24] it
[1:19:27] the goal of the bride is not to let it
[1:19:30] not to let iniquity remain in her that's
[1:19:33] the goal of the bride
[1:19:35] and she's the only one that will do
[1:19:38] something with her iniquity
[1:19:40] she's the only one
[1:19:43] second timothy chapter 2 verse 19 second
[1:19:45] timothy chapter 2 verse 19
[1:19:47] nevertheless the foundation of
[1:19:51] god stands sure having this seal
[1:19:55] the lord knoweth them that are his
[1:19:58] and let everyone that nameth the name of
[1:20:01] christ
[1:20:02] depart from iniquity
[1:20:06] make a choice to go in a different
[1:20:09] direction than doing your will
[1:20:11] amen amen amen don't be satisfied with
[1:20:15] knowing god's will what god did for you
[1:20:19] and not care about what not care about
[1:20:22] doing his will
[1:20:24] don't be satisfied with doing your will
[1:20:26] it's iniquity
[1:20:27] it was at the beginning it is today it
[1:20:30] is important that we come to grips with
[1:20:32] the importance
[1:20:33] yes of doing the will of god for our
[1:20:35] lives
[1:20:39] we can't just well i'm going to do this
[1:20:41] do this this i'm saved everything's okay
[1:20:46] it won't work friends take a look at
[1:20:48] matthew chapter 7 i'll show you
[1:20:51] amen the bride is the only one that's
[1:20:53] going to depart from her iniquity
[1:20:55] matthew chapter 7 verse 21 not everyone
[1:20:57] that sayeth unto me
[1:20:58] lord lord shown her to the kingdom of
[1:21:01] heaven
[1:21:02] but he that doeth the will of my father
[1:21:05] which is in heaven
[1:21:06] the will of my father amen amen
[1:21:11] lucifer was okay in fact he was actually
[1:21:14] perfect
[1:21:16] until he decided to do his own will
[1:21:21] [Music]
[1:21:24] see the importance here is to do all of
[1:21:27] god's will
[1:21:28] and not just part of god's will
[1:21:31] many will say unto me that day lord lord
[1:21:35] have we not prophesied thy name
[1:21:39] and in thy name cast out devils and in
[1:21:41] thy name done many
[1:21:42] wonderful works
[1:21:46] and then why profess unto them
[1:21:50] you're liars he doesn't say that
[1:21:56] he doesn't he doesn't challenge them on
[1:21:59] what they did
[1:22:01] he doesn't say no you didn't cast out
[1:22:04] devils
[1:22:05] he didn't say no you didn't do many
[1:22:06] wonderful works
[1:22:10] he's letting us know that's not good
[1:22:12] enough
[1:22:16] and then i will profess to them i never
[1:22:18] knew you depart from me
[1:22:20] he that work his own will
[1:22:24] amen he who works his own
[1:22:27] will
[1:22:31] it's important friends it's really
[1:22:34] important
[1:22:35] now i know the devil has spoken to us
[1:22:38] just like he did all these people
[1:22:40] and said well as long as you go to
[1:22:42] church as long as you pay your tithes
[1:22:45] as long as you fill in the blank in the
[1:22:47] message
[1:22:50] as long as you're okay you can do what
[1:22:52] you want to do
[1:22:53] do what you want to do
[1:22:57] but god's own testimony
[1:23:00] is that he didn't have a relationship
[1:23:02] with him
[1:23:03] because the relationship that he's
[1:23:05] looking for with the bride is one in
[1:23:07] which god
[1:23:08] is the head amen that his bride does his
[1:23:12] will
[1:23:13] and not just does a couple rules and
[1:23:16] regulations to be accepted to go to
[1:23:18] heaven
[1:23:20] we're talking about relationship here
[1:23:26] it's important to do all those things
[1:23:32] but we've been called to do the will of
[1:23:35] god when we're born again
[1:23:37] all things are of god right
[1:23:40] right his we now it's his will so it's
[1:23:44] really really important
[1:23:46] that we want have a love for the truth
[1:23:48] and the truth is this is the truth
[1:23:50] on the day of judgment when it's all
[1:23:52] over the truth is god's will will stand
[1:23:55] god's will is preeminent god's will is
[1:23:58] the omnipotent
[1:24:00] every knee will bell every tongue will
[1:24:01] confess it
[1:24:03] is going to end up in god's will
[1:24:06] between now and then we have a choice to
[1:24:08] make to walk in the spirit
[1:24:10] to choose to do god's will amen
[1:24:13] that's what's important not making it to
[1:24:16] church and say i did my sunday job
[1:24:19] it's about getting serious with your
[1:24:20] life with god amen
[1:24:26] i want the testimony
[1:24:30] i don't know who i was talking to about
[1:24:32] the testimony with enoch
[1:24:33] enoch had a wonderful testimony he
[1:24:36] walked with god
[1:24:37] right amen but noticed
[1:24:41] he wasn't perfect when he started
[1:24:46] he had iniquity in his life but you know
[1:24:48] what he kept doing every time god showed
[1:24:50] him
[1:24:51] he kept taking care of it yes
[1:24:55] he kept walking on a daily basis with
[1:24:57] god
[1:24:59] because god's own testimony
[1:25:04] the by the word of god says he walked
[1:25:07] with
[1:25:07] god to walk in the spirit we got to be
[1:25:11] serious about
[1:25:12] the iniquity in our life that we all
[1:25:14] have
[1:25:15] yes does the bible say that he that
[1:25:19] coverth we don't want to
[1:25:22] cover we want to we want to depart from
[1:25:26] it
[1:25:27] now i'm not saying you need to tell
[1:25:29] everybody i don't think you need to tell
[1:25:31] one person your iniquity
[1:25:33] in fact i advise you not to do it
[1:25:37] there's only one person in here that i
[1:25:39] know that will handle your iniquity
[1:25:41] properly
[1:25:42] and that's god amen amen
[1:25:48] deal with it
[1:25:52] depart from it because your relationship
[1:25:56] depends on it with god
[1:25:58] your relationship depends on it with god
[1:26:01] jesus said in john chapter 16 verse 13
[1:26:03] how be it when the spirit of truth
[1:26:07] is come he will guide you
[1:26:10] into all truth in other words he's going
[1:26:13] to
[1:26:14] guide you to depart from it from
[1:26:17] iniquity right
[1:26:18] amen that's the truth for he shall not
[1:26:21] speak of himself
[1:26:22] but whatsoever he shall hear that shall
[1:26:25] we speak
[1:26:28] the spirit of truth will guide you into
[1:26:30] all truth but the spirit of air will
[1:26:32] lead and guide you into iniquity
[1:26:34] and it's okay
[1:26:38] where you feel safe with having the
[1:26:40] knowledge of the truth without the
[1:26:41] spirit of truth to obey it
[1:26:44] a lot of times we enjoy a spirit that
[1:26:46] comes to us and tells us
[1:26:48] how great we are how good we are that
[1:26:50] we're in the message that we're safe
[1:26:52] that we're secure
[1:26:53] that we're not as bad as the other
[1:26:54] person but that's a spirit that's
[1:26:57] speaking of himself
[1:26:58] and when the spirit of truth come he
[1:26:59] won't do that
[1:27:03] so he's going to talk about god amen
[1:27:05] amen
[1:27:06] what we need to become to become more
[1:27:09] like him
[1:27:11] i'll tell you i'll say this
[1:27:14] we don't know we can't even discern the
[1:27:17] majority of times that the devil is
[1:27:18] speaking to us
[1:27:21] but because we're in the message and
[1:27:23] we're bright we feel so good about it
[1:27:26] we need to start exercising trying the
[1:27:28] spirits
[1:27:30] because it's not we don't make a rapture
[1:27:32] because we say we're in the message
[1:27:35] we make a rapture because we go on to
[1:27:37] perfection
[1:27:38] amen amen the message is pointing us
[1:27:42] to perfection amen it's brought us the
[1:27:45] good news
[1:27:46] what we need to get ready
[1:27:53] john chapter 8 verse 28 let's
[1:27:57] see if we can just find that
[1:28:03] oh my there's a there's so much here
[1:28:09] i'm just going to say it took me a half
[1:28:11] hour to go through
[1:28:13] you know the pictures at the beginning
[1:28:18] matthew chapter eight i'm going to start
[1:28:20] with verse 28.
[1:28:24] oh that what did i say matthew i did say
[1:28:27] john
[1:28:28] i said matthew first we're amen i am
[1:28:31] in john chapter 8 right now what did i
[1:28:33] say
[1:28:35] i am sorry matthew they were disciples
[1:28:37] and everything but as i'm not reading on
[1:28:39] matthew right now
[1:28:44] you know this was weird i i mean i'm as
[1:28:46] i'm
[1:28:47] as you know i used a lot of notes
[1:28:48] because i just
[1:28:51] i spent a lot of time studying
[1:28:54] and i'm typing out you know what i'm
[1:28:56] thinking
[1:28:57] and i'm saying it i looked down and i
[1:29:00] did
[1:29:00] not say those words and i just and
[1:29:04] it's written you know no spelling errors
[1:29:06] but i just didn't say the words
[1:29:08] what is your problem so i can relate
[1:29:12] to saint matthew when i didn't mean it
[1:29:15] john chapter 8 verse 28
[1:29:18] then said jesus unto them when ye have
[1:29:21] lifted up the son of man
[1:29:23] then shall you know that i am he and i
[1:29:25] do nothing
[1:29:27] of myself but as my father
[1:29:30] taught me i speak these things
[1:29:34] and he's and he that sent me is with me
[1:29:37] and the father
[1:29:38] have not left me for i always do those
[1:29:41] things
[1:29:42] that are pleasing to him
[1:29:45] and as he spake these words many
[1:29:48] many many many many many believed on him
[1:29:53] and you would have thought that would
[1:29:54] have been good enough
[1:29:57] he would have just said good enough
[1:30:01] that's all you need to do
[1:30:04] then said jesus to the jews which did
[1:30:07] to the many many many that believed on
[1:30:09] him if you
[1:30:11] continue in my word then
[1:30:14] are you my disciples indeed amen
[1:30:18] so this could be continue to do the
[1:30:20] things
[1:30:21] that you've been taught continue
[1:30:25] it also could be continue to grow in
[1:30:28] those things that you've been taught
[1:30:31] it also could mean continue as i give
[1:30:34] you new word
[1:30:36] to continue in that so there's a lot of
[1:30:38] continuation
[1:30:39] that we could be looking at here amen
[1:30:44] and ye shall know the truth and the
[1:30:47] truth
[1:30:48] shall make you free
[1:30:54] see the the words that are coming forth
[1:30:58] from the bible they do not make you free
[1:31:04] the truth that you're hearing with your
[1:31:06] ears does not make you free
[1:31:09] you do have to accept it you have to
[1:31:13] believe it
[1:31:14] not like the devils believe it but you
[1:31:16] have to believe it by accepting it
[1:31:19] and obeying it and when you do
[1:31:23] the truth shall set you free
[1:31:28] the knowledge of the word will only
[1:31:30] condemn you
[1:31:31] it's got to go beyond that
[1:31:37] say amen to the accepting of the word
[1:31:40] say amen to the spirit of the word say
[1:31:43] amen to i love the truth of the word
[1:31:46] amen praise god
[1:31:53] the law's in our court it's up to us
[1:31:56] whether we're going to follow through
[1:31:58] with it amen
[1:32:01] some people are just mystery seekers
[1:32:08] they want to know the day and the hour
[1:32:11] hidden things that brother branham said
[1:32:13] between the lines
[1:32:16] the things that brother branham wasn't
[1:32:17] allowed to say
[1:32:20] the answers to all the mysteries to
[1:32:23] their questions
[1:32:27] basically it couldn't be anything that
[1:32:29] satisfies their discovery channel
[1:32:33] as long as they don't have to die out
[1:32:36] they want to hear about it
[1:32:38] i want to sit down hear a sermon learn
[1:32:40] new things
[1:32:43] but if i got to die out about it it is
[1:32:44] just not my cup of tea
[1:32:47] i call mystery seekers
[1:32:50] look what it did for every
[1:32:54] oh she wanted to she was so interested
[1:32:56] in being like god
[1:33:00] but the man said she lusted for
[1:33:01] knowledge amen
[1:33:04] even though god didn't want us to know
[1:33:06] the day or the hour we still want to
[1:33:08] know the day right now
[1:33:12] there's a reason god didn't want us to
[1:33:14] know
[1:33:17] he he told us the most important thing
[1:33:20] be ready
[1:33:21] be ready amen be ready
[1:33:29] the reason that he said about the the
[1:33:32] fig tree
[1:33:33] when you begin to see it you know that
[1:33:35] summer's night that this generation's
[1:33:37] not going to pass
[1:33:38] he gave us a sign that we're near the
[1:33:40] end
[1:33:44] but he doesn't want us to know the day
[1:33:47] or the hour
[1:33:48] right
[1:34:01] we want our preacher to stand up here
[1:34:04] and tell us something we don't know
[1:34:07] so we can leave here feeling like i've
[1:34:08] got something
[1:34:10] that i didn't have on a cape
[1:34:15] but what god wants is you to be ready
[1:34:18] amen he wants you to be more in love
[1:34:22] with him
[1:34:24] more in love with the word
[1:34:27] like you want to become the word and
[1:34:29] that you love him so much you're willing
[1:34:31] to die out for it amen
[1:34:33] that's what he's interested in amen
[1:34:35] that's not what your flesh is interested
[1:34:37] in
[1:34:39] and there's the battle that's why we
[1:34:41] have to choose
[1:34:42] to walk in the spirit choose it
[1:34:46] first corinthians chapter 13 verse 1.
[1:34:49] first corinthians chapter 13 verse 1
[1:34:51] though i speak with the tongues of men
[1:34:54] and of angels
[1:34:55] and have not charity
[1:34:58] i become a sounding brass or tinkling
[1:35:01] symbols
[1:35:05] and though i have the gift of prophecy
[1:35:07] and understand all mysteries and all
[1:35:08] knowledge and though i have all faith
[1:35:10] so that i can remove mountains and under
[1:35:12] charity i'm nothing you could understand
[1:35:14] all the mysteries
[1:35:16] you can have all the knowledge amen
[1:35:20] we don't need to be mystery seekers we
[1:35:22] need to be
[1:35:23] master pleasers
[1:35:26] big difference big difference once i
[1:35:29] want to please my master
[1:35:31] amen amen the others i want to seek
[1:35:34] more mysteries so i can know more
[1:35:38] so i can be puffed up more right but you
[1:35:41] know it's really
[1:35:42] love that edifies charity is what
[1:35:44] edifies amen
[1:35:45] amen yes
[1:35:53] and though i bestow all my goods to feed
[1:35:55] the poor
[1:35:56] and though i get my body to be burned
[1:35:59] and
[1:36:00] and have not charity profit me it sounds
[1:36:02] like
[1:36:03] i prophesied your name i did many
[1:36:05] wonderful works i cast out devils
[1:36:07] i didn't know you i don't know you there
[1:36:10] is no relationship
[1:36:12] they must have been missing a love for
[1:36:14] the word
[1:36:15] amen a love for the truth a love to do
[1:36:18] the things that they're not
[1:36:20] doing instead of being satisfied with
[1:36:23] the things that they are doing
[1:36:26] first corinthians chapter 13 verse 9
[1:36:28] dropping down to verse 9 for we know in
[1:36:30] part we prophesy in part but when that
[1:36:32] which is perfect
[1:36:33] is come then that which is in part shall
[1:36:35] be done away when as a child i spake as
[1:36:39] a child i understood as a child i
[1:36:40] thought as a child but
[1:36:41] when i became a man i put away
[1:36:49] i put away that thinking
[1:36:52] of wanting to know
[1:36:58] and took on the maturity that god wants
[1:37:01] me to love like him
[1:37:02] amen amen
[1:37:07] seek to love god
[1:37:10] now we're wrapping up it's warm in here
[1:37:13] i didn't touch the heat
[1:37:16] but it is like it's like in an oven
[1:37:21] and i'm okay with it no no brother mike
[1:37:22] sit down i'm okay with it
[1:37:25] but i need you to wake up
[1:37:28] we're almost done this is important
[1:37:32] first john chapter 3 verse 10 in this
[1:37:35] the children of god are manifest in the
[1:37:39] children of the devil
[1:37:40] whosoever does not righteousness is not
[1:37:44] a god
[1:37:45] well that's obvious neither he
[1:37:50] that loveth not his brother
[1:37:54] whoa how important is it
[1:37:58] for this is the message that you have
[1:38:01] heard from
[1:38:02] the beginning that you should love one
[1:38:04] another
[1:38:05] amen amen not as cain who was of that
[1:38:09] wicked one
[1:38:10] and slew his brother wherefore slew him
[1:38:12] because his own works for evil and his

[1:41:48] a man of unclean lips
[1:41:54] that you were just filthy and dirty
[1:41:57] and you had to be cleansed washed
[1:42:01] and then it got all done you had to do

[1:42:26] message from the beginning
[1:42:28] love one another amen we heard the
[1:42:30] message at the end time
[1:42:31] from the messenger himself comes back
[1:42:34] with a report
[1:42:36] where we put in our emphasis
[1:42:40] you have to choose to walk in the spirit
[1:42:44] when you are loving one another without
[1:42:47] respect to persons
[1:42:49] there's no animosity no hurt i can tell
[1:42:52] you of assuredly
[1:42:53] you're walking in the spirit right amen
[1:42:58] but when you hold things when you think
[1:43:01] things
[1:43:03] when you allow certain things to go
[1:43:05] unharnessed and you don't bring it under
[1:43:08] subjection
[1:43:10] i don't care how much you quote the word
[1:43:16] it's not a choice to walk with the word
[1:43:19] it's a choice to walk with the spirit of
[1:43:21] the word amen
[1:43:24] choosing to walk in the spirit
[1:43:27] hallelujah
[1:43:35] this i say then walk in the spirit
[1:43:39] and you shall not fulfill the lust of
[1:43:41] the flesh
[1:43:44] first john chapter 3 verse 13 marvel not
[1:43:47] my brethren if the world hates you
[1:43:50] we know that we have passed from death
[1:43:52] unto life
[1:43:54] because we love the brethren amen
[1:44:00] right not because we got all the
[1:44:01] mysteries got all the knowledge
[1:44:04] profits nothing
[1:44:07] but we know we have a revelation a
[1:44:09] rock-solid revelation
[1:44:11] we know that we have passed from death
[1:44:13] unto life because we love
[1:44:14] the brethren and he that loveth not his
[1:44:18] brother
[1:44:19] he abides in death amen
[1:44:23] so i'll set before you this day life and
[1:44:24] death right
[1:44:27] the choice to walk in the flesh or to
[1:44:29] walk in the spirit
[1:44:31] the choice to love god
[1:44:35] or love with their respective persons
[1:44:40] verse 15 but whosoever hateth his
[1:44:42] brother is a murderer
[1:44:43] and we know that no murderer have
[1:44:44] eternal life abiding in him
[1:44:48] shouldn't be anything about i'm going to
[1:44:50] a place of eternal life
[1:44:52] it should be about what's abiding in you
[1:44:55] hereby perceive we the love of god
[1:44:57] because he laid down his life for us
[1:44:59] we ought to lay down our lives for one
[1:45:01] another
[1:45:03] that's what we should be doing oh
[1:45:06] brother john i'm pretty busy
[1:45:08] and you know this covet and you know
[1:45:12] whatever i know the word
[1:45:16] that's what i know this is what we
[1:45:18] should be doing
[1:45:20] i don't want to preach another gospel i
[1:45:23] want to be a curse
[1:45:28] i don't want to get on another side so
[1:45:29] you lied to me
[1:45:34] what kind of friend would i be
[1:45:39] here you are you come you give your time
[1:45:43] you submit
[1:45:47] why would i want to come short of
[1:45:49] telling you nothing but the pure truth
[1:46:00] all right let's get ready to wrap this
[1:46:02] up two more quick verses
[1:46:03] john 15 verse 12. john 15 verse 12 this
[1:46:07] is my commandment
[1:46:13] that you love one another as i have
[1:46:16] loved you
[1:46:19] greater love have no man this and a man
[1:46:21] lay down his life for his friends
[1:46:25] john 13 35 by this shall all men know
[1:46:28] that you're my disciples if you have
[1:46:29] love one for another
[1:46:31] amen jesus sets before us a choice
[1:46:35] now though it is his commandment and he
[1:46:38] says i command you
[1:46:40] that you love one another it's still a
[1:46:42] choice
[1:46:43] because of free more agency
[1:46:47] and we can choose life we can choose to
[1:46:49] walk in the spirit
[1:46:50] we can choose to love if i ever go to
[1:46:54] a place in it ever ever in my mind
[1:46:57] to think of why
[1:47:00] this person that's standing in front of
[1:47:04] me or that i'm talking with
[1:47:06] doesn't deserve to be loved with the
[1:47:07] pure love of god that's really good
[1:47:10] you will automatically lose every time
[1:47:14] it's not a matter whether that person's
[1:47:16] worthy it's a matter of the one that
[1:47:19] called you and loves you when you are
[1:47:22] unworthy
[1:47:24] to let that same love love through you
[1:47:26] to that person
[1:47:29] you're just a vessel you're just an
[1:47:31] extension cord
[1:47:34] it's not about delegating and putting in
[1:47:38] proper
[1:47:39] carnal order where everybody is right
[1:47:43] it's about spiritually putting everybody
[1:47:45] on the same plane
[1:47:46] love one another walk in the spirit and
[1:47:48] you'll not fulfill that lust of the
[1:47:50] flesh
[1:47:52] amen together
[1:48:00] what a grand opportunity we have
[1:48:06] to think that i'm not a robot
[1:48:10] and have a choice a choice to love
[1:48:15] when i'm not being loved
[1:48:18] a choice to lay down my life when the
[1:48:21] person
[1:48:21] i'm doing it for wouldn't even think
[1:48:23] about laying down his life for me
[1:48:26] that's awesome to me that
[1:48:29] now if all i'm doing is thinking
[1:48:31] currently about my relationship with
[1:48:32] that person
[1:48:33] oh boy oh that's just not fair
[1:48:38] well it's not about you and your
[1:48:40] relationship with that person
[1:48:41] it's about you and your relationship
[1:48:43] with god amen
[1:48:45] that's what's important because when i
[1:48:48] get to having the right one when i get
[1:48:50] that when i get to the
[1:48:51] judgment bar there's not one person on
[1:48:54] the planet
[1:48:54] that can get me in
[1:48:58] saint peter won't be standing by the
[1:49:00] gate with the keys
[1:49:02] and saying well you know
[1:49:05] he did all right
[1:49:08] no one i got to stand for him
[1:49:12] if i stand for him he'll stand for me
[1:49:18] so what's important is not between you
[1:49:20] and that person
[1:49:21] it's been between you and god and god
[1:49:24] has called us
[1:49:25] to lay down our life to depart from
[1:49:29] iniquity
[1:49:30] to take to get away from anything that
[1:49:34] causes
[1:49:34] us to not walk in the spirit
[1:49:38] and make that choice i'm gonna i'm
[1:49:40] choosing
[1:49:41] today to walk in the spirit i'm gonna go
[1:49:43] in this direction
[1:49:44] i'm gonna get more serious about it when
[1:49:46] i come to church i'm gonna start making
[1:49:48] the services
[1:49:50] amen i'm gonna start listening for the
[1:49:53] voice of god when i read
[1:49:55] and when i get on my knees i want to be
[1:49:57] more real
[1:49:58] i want this thing to be real not just a
[1:50:00] religion
[1:50:02] amen is that your desire today amen
[1:50:06] amen let's look to the lord in prayer
