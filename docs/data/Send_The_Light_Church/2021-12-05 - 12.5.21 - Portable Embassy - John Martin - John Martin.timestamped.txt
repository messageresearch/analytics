[36:55] one of the most misunderstood ideas i
[36:58] believe about being a believer
[37:00] is just because we gave our life to
[37:02] christ one day doesn't mean we have
[37:04] given our life to christ every day
[37:08] doesn't mean that we're walking in the
[37:09] spirit every day
[37:11] but jesus told us a powerful secret he
[37:13] said if we could just deny ourselves
[37:16] paul said if you walk in the spirit
[37:18] you'll not fulfill the lust of the flesh
[37:21] god will be able to use us more
[37:24] what happens when we walk in our flesh
[37:27] simply we fulfill our desire
[37:30] so what happens when we walk in the
[37:32] spirit we fulfill god's desire
[37:38] we don't we don't even want to walk in
[37:40] our flesh and try to do god's desire
[37:43] it just messes things up
[37:45] god takes a selfish life self-centered
[37:48] only concerned about themselves and
[37:51] changes their very nature
[37:53] into the image of christ
[37:56] whereby the love of christ inside their
[37:57] hall
[37:58] now constrains them to live for others
[38:02] they feel in debt to live out god's
[38:04] desire and not their own anymore
[38:07] and so god says here in the scriptures
[38:09] that he makes us ambassadors for christ
[38:11] this is not an option
[38:13] like going to college where you decide
[38:15] what you want to be
[38:18] god's perfect will is not for you to
[38:20] have an opinion about being an
[38:22] ambassador for christ
[38:24] it's not like we have a electoral vote
[38:27] whether we want to or not
[38:30] if your nature gets completely changed
[38:32] when all where all things become new and
[38:34] all things are of god god is going to
[38:36] take your life and you will become an
[38:38] ambassador for him
[38:40] he gives us a ministry of reconciliation
[38:43] the bible says
[38:47] no
[38:49] this is not meant as a preacher or a
[38:51] preaching
[38:53] but rather as a servant that god
[38:56] gives attendance
[38:58] to god
[39:00] god makes us servants and he takes our
[39:03] lives
[39:05] and we now are used them in every
[39:07] possible way
[39:09] as that's our ministry this word
[39:12] manifested in the flesh to bring
[39:14] people closer to the image of christ
[39:22] it can't just be in front of a group of
[39:24] people
[39:28] this ministry
[39:29] is for every for the young for the old
[39:32] it's for every single one that comes to
[39:35] christ and christ has his way god will
[39:38] use that vessel because all things were
[39:40] created by him and for him and for his
[39:42] glory he's not interested in my glory
[39:47] not even the slightest
[39:50] not even the very little god would you
[39:52] just no
[39:54] no flesh will glory in his presence
[39:56] we make glory
[39:58] but we'll step out of his presence
[40:01] he just goes like this
[40:05] now embassies that we know
[40:08] are in foreign countries
[40:11] and they're a they're in a fixed
[40:13] location
[40:15] people seek asylum and refuge there is a
[40:17] u.s citizen or they want to be
[40:20] it's considered a place of safety and
[40:22] security a shelter like a safe house
[40:26] from the foreign country that they're in
[40:28] at the time
[40:30] but we as ambassadors for christ are not
[40:32] in a fixed location
[40:34] we are a portable embassy
[40:37] we're mobile
[40:38] we move from place to place but with the
[40:41] same purpose
[40:43] not for the physical body
[40:45] but for the souls that need to be
[40:47] convinced that they need christ
[40:51] not just for those
[40:54] who know they need christ
[40:57] you first have to give them the word and
[40:59] let them know that they're going to go
[41:00] to hell
[41:01] in this world this foreign country that
[41:04] they're in
[41:07] and if something inside them says
[41:09] i believe that
[41:11] then
[41:12] they found the refuge through you
[41:16] their souls need refuge they need safety
[41:23] the bible says that the name of christ
[41:25] is the high tower where the righteous
[41:27] run into and are safe
[41:29] that he is a present help in a time of
[41:31] needs psalms 91 verse 2 says i will say
[41:34] of the lord he is my refuge he is my
[41:36] fortress my god in him i will trust
[41:40] i'll say today thank god
[41:43] that he sent somebody by my way he sent
[41:45] a portable embassy my way to tell me
[41:48] that i am going to hell without him
[41:56] because the churches i went to
[42:02] i felt if i just did this and if i just
[42:05] did that they told me i would be just
[42:07] fine
[42:11] but my nature never seemed to change
[42:16] and that's the evidence
[42:18] when christ comes into your heart
[42:21] something happens on the inside
[42:23] god doesn't want our wa our wallet
[42:27] our wardrobe
[42:30] our hair the way that we look
[42:34] he's not interested in how many candles
[42:36] we burn
[42:39] he wants our heart
[42:42] inside there he has control of changing
[42:45] the nature and when he does every one of
[42:47] those things will be his
[42:50] your hair
[42:51] your dress
[42:52] your pocketbook
[42:54] everything will eventually because he
[42:57] become his because everything was
[42:59] created for his glory
[43:05] now we're sent out as a beacon of light
[43:10] i love that little song by
[43:13] our young people this morning
[43:15] in this foreign world where people don't
[43:17] even know they're lost
[43:20] our job is to convince them that they
[43:22] need christ and it's pretty hard we've
[43:24] all experienced it have we not
[43:26] but we still have to convince them
[43:29] that's the that's the job now we got to
[43:31] do it in a way that they're not offended
[43:34] but they may get offended and as long as
[43:36] they don't get offended by you it's okay
[43:41] but if the word offends them
[43:43] you can't do nothing about it
[43:46] i'll say like this if you ever get
[43:48] offended by the word
[43:50] something is wrong in your relationship
[43:52] with christ
[43:54] because the bible says great peace have
[43:56] they that loved my law and nothing shall
[43:58] offend them fall in love with jesus
[44:00] that's always the test
[44:04] paul
[44:05] was told by jesus and his encounter like
[44:08] his first encounter with jesus he said i
[44:10] have appeared unto thee for this purpose
[44:12] to open the eyes of the people
[44:16] to turn them from darkness to light from
[44:18] the power of satan unto god now all that
[44:20] responsibility was put on paul
[44:25] so he just couldn't say you know what i
[44:27] think you should maybe you know kind of
[44:28] consider you know
[44:31] going to church
[44:33] you know
[44:34] you know jesus maybe he you know he
[44:36] could be
[44:38] that ain't going to convince anybody
[44:41] when we're living in the world and
[44:43] trying to convince somebody of jesus
[44:44] that ain't going to convince anybody
[44:49] they've got to know you're serious
[44:54] it's a serious job
[44:56] but that's our job and we've got to
[44:58] accept that responsibility
[45:00] jesus said in matthew 28 verse 19 before
[45:03] he left
[45:04] he said go ye therefore and teach all
[45:06] nations baptizing them in the name of
[45:09] the father and of the son and the holy
[45:10] ghost teaching them to observe all
[45:13] things whatsoever i've commanded you and
[45:15] along with you always even to the end of
[45:17] the world
[45:21] this is called god's great commission to
[45:23] the church
[45:27] it's still happening
[45:29] now the majority of believers view this
[45:31] commission as not so great
[45:35] come on
[45:37] you can be honest with with me this
[45:40] morning trying to be honest with you
[45:43] it's more like a a college elect a
[45:45] college elective
[45:47] it's optional it's not really necessary
[45:50] or mandatory
[45:53] these believers i'm gonna say it like
[45:54] this straight out have not totally
[45:56] surrendered over to
[45:58] god they have not allowed christ to be
[46:01] preeminent in their life
[46:03] their personal mission is not in life is
[46:06] not the commission that he gave
[46:09] they have a different commission
[46:13] but those who have set their affections
[46:15] on things above and not on things of
[46:17] earth god has given them the ministry of
[46:20] reconciliation amen
[46:24] they are truly ambassadors for christ
[46:26] working from my portable
[46:28] embassy
[46:30] sometimes our power has gone out at work
[46:33] the phones have gone out
[46:35] sometimes the phones have gone out
[46:37] power's gone out
[46:39] but the work must go on
[46:42] so you get on your cell phone you get
[46:43] your car and you're talking to your
[46:45] customers
[46:50] we may not have the perfect setting when
[46:52] we're in the grocery store
[46:54] when we're at the fuel pump
[46:59] but god wants to use you right where
[47:01] you're at
[47:02] right where you live
[47:04] with your family with your neighbors
[47:07] with those you come in contact that
[47:08] you've never met before
[47:15] we're sent out as beacons of light in
[47:17] this former world with an awesome
[47:19] responsibility
[47:24] being prepared for this work requires
[47:25] more time on our knees than it does
[47:28] studying
[47:30] let that sink in we need to study it's
[47:33] required
[47:34] paul told timothy in 2 timothy chapter 2
[47:36] verse 15 a familiar scripture to us all
[47:39] study to show thyself approved unto god
[47:44] a workman that needeth not be ashamed
[47:47] rightly dividing the word of truth
[47:52] do you know the word study only appears
[47:54] three times in the bible
[47:58] the word pray is mentioned over 300
[48:00] times
[48:04] the word prayer is mentioned over a
[48:05] hundred times now we've got 400 to three
[48:09] i think we need to spend more time
[48:11] praying than studying
[48:14] come on
[48:20] we need to spend more time with the
[48:22] author of the manual
[48:24] to know exactly what it's saying than we
[48:26] do trying to figure things out with our
[48:28] understanding
[48:32] when god got a hold of the disciples
[48:34] they went out
[48:36] as portable embassies
[48:40] they didn't sit around waiting for
[48:42] people to come to them
[48:45] oh i can't wait for an opportunity
[48:47] you've got your whole life occupied till
[48:49] i come
[48:56] once our candle has been lit god wants
[48:58] us to go light one amen
[49:00] fact the prophet said it's not fair that
[49:02] we should hear the gospel twice if
[49:04] others have not heard it once who's even
[49:06] concerned about the person who hasn't
[49:07] heard it once
[49:18] jesus
[49:21] said that
[49:22] you shall be witnesses
[49:24] or portable embassies
[49:26] unto me in jerusalem in all judea
[49:30] in samaria and the uttermost parts of
[49:33] the earth
[49:36] you have to be a portable embassy to to
[49:39] go on all those places
[49:40] you can't invite the whole world to this
[49:42] place
[49:45] so god sends us out
[49:49] with a commission
[49:51] to bring christ to them
[49:54] they don't know they need to come here
[49:57] before christ was introduced to me i
[49:59] thought it was just fine
[50:04] after peter and john received the power
[50:06] of the holy ghost god sent them out as a
[50:08] portable embassy to the gate called
[50:10] beautiful turn with me if you would acts
[50:13] chapter 3 verse 1 if you want to write
[50:15] it down there's a man there that needed
[50:16] healing
[50:18] peter and john went up together into the
[50:20] temple at the hour of prayer notice the
[50:23] hour of prayer wasn't the hour of
[50:25] studying
[50:28] being the ninth hour and a certain man
[50:30] laying from his mother's room carried
[50:33] was carried
[50:34] whom they laid daily at the gate of the
[50:36] temple which is called beautiful to ask
[50:39] alms of them that entered into the
[50:40] temple what
[50:43] what a life
[50:46] to have to ask
[50:49] all your life
[50:52] we're blessed we're blessed all we've
[50:55] got to do is believe the word
[50:58] do what god tells us to do
[51:01] yeah it may some of us
[51:03] uh
[51:04] some of us honestly
[51:06] need to start working more
[51:14] who's seeing peter and john
[51:17] about to go into the temple asked at
[51:19] alms
[51:20] and peter fastening his eyes upon him
[51:24] with john said look on us
[51:29] wow
[51:30] kind of like follow me
[51:32] as i follow christ
[51:34] look on us they became a portable
[51:38] embassy for christ
[51:41] and he gave heed unto them expecting to
[51:43] receive something of them
[51:46] and then peter said silver and gold have
[51:48] i none but such as i have
[51:52] give iv
[51:54] in the name of jesus christ of nazareth
[51:56] rise up and walk
[51:59] a portable embassy
[52:00] [Music]
[52:02] such as i have i wonder what we have
[52:04] today
[52:07] because money can't buy you power
[52:11] can't buy you the the faith in jesus
[52:14] christ
[52:18] tell you but the power of the holy ghost
[52:19] will do it
[52:22] that's what we need is the power of the
[52:24] holy ghost that's why we need to pray
[52:29] you know we can sit down and read the
[52:30] bible like we do a newspaper
[52:32] a magazine
[52:34] but when you get down on your knees it's
[52:36] a whole nother ballgame
[52:41] in acts chapter 4 verse 13 now when they
[52:44] saw the boldness
[52:46] of peter and john
[52:48] and perceived that they were
[52:50] we might just say just
[52:52] unlearn
[52:54] and ignorant men
[52:56] they marveled
[52:57] and they took knowledge of them that
[52:59] they had been with jesus
[53:03] i don't care how unlearned you are
[53:06] i don't care how ignorant you may seem
[53:08] at times
[53:09] but if you just spend more time with
[53:11] jesus people are going to take knowledge
[53:13] that you've been with him
[53:16] something happens in that prayer closet
[53:20] change takes place
[53:25] and the holy ghost comes upon us people
[53:27] will notice there's something different
[53:28] they're not going to see you and you
[53:30] about to say look on me
[53:32] because you'll know it's not you it's
[53:35] christ in you the hope of glory
[53:40] when jesus looked at the people he
[53:42] looked through the bible says the eyes
[53:44] of compassion
[53:46] how he could help so many people
[53:49] he said he was moved with compassion
[53:50] upon them because they fainted and were
[53:52] scattered abroad as sheep having no
[53:54] shepherd so when you go to the grocery
[53:56] store you're driving down the road you
[53:58] see all these cars
[54:00] you also just recognize that there's so
[54:02] many people in the world
[54:04] that are scattered abroad having no
[54:06] shepherd
[54:09] having no leadership for their lives
[54:12] in matthew chapter 9 verse 37 then saith
[54:15] jesus to his disciples the harvest truly
[54:18] is plenteous
[54:20] but the laborers
[54:23] the laborers
[54:25] those who are willing
[54:28] to do more than sit around
[54:32] the laborers are few he said pray
[54:36] pray
[54:38] pray don't study pray
[54:42] pray ye there for the lord of the
[54:43] harvest that he will send forth laborers
[54:46] into the harvest
[54:48] in other words he was saying pray for
[54:50] portable embassies
[54:55] pray there'll be somebody that goes out
[54:57] and gets things that are scattered and
[54:59] let them know that we have a great
[55:00] shepherd
[55:04] you christ in you will lead christ
[55:08] to them to him
[55:13] christ isn't doing the work you're going
[55:14] to lead them to you
[55:18] i wonder today what eyes we're looking
[55:20] through
[55:23] what is our interest with others
[55:27] are we looking for a friend
[55:30] for fellowship
[55:32] for a following
[55:34] what is our real interest when we talk
[55:36] to others is it about our reputation is
[55:39] it we want them to see
[55:41] cease that we're special
[55:43] or are they are we really wanting them
[55:45] to see a special god
[55:50] there's a difference
[55:54] do we see them the way jesus does
[55:58] do we see others fainting when we look
[56:00] at them
[56:03] or do we see them
[56:05] in some carnal way
[56:10] do we feel they're scattered
[56:13] and a lot of people are scattered their
[56:14] own thoughts are scattered
[56:18] do we see people need a shepherd
[56:23] then it's our responsibility to bring
[56:25] the shepherd to them
[56:30] most of the world doesn't want a
[56:31] shepherd
[56:35] that's why we have to be moved with
[56:37] compassion because it's going to take
[56:39] the love of god in our heart to go there
[56:41] and be
[56:42] tore up by their words
[56:45] to bring them a greater life a greater
[56:48] light than they're living in
[56:51] and i'll tell you today's saints it's
[56:53] not just for those who don't know christ
[56:55] it's for those who only know christ so
[56:58] much and god wants to be more to them
[57:03] do we love others enough to lay down our
[57:06] life
[57:06] for others
[57:08] brother branham said eternal life is
[57:09] living for others
[57:11] but do we really know what that means
[57:14] the only way that we're going to live
[57:16] for others correctly
[57:18] is by being moved by compassion
[57:21] the same thing that jesus had when he
[57:23] looked at them
[57:25] there's a lot of people that don't have
[57:27] compassion and they want a following
[57:30] they want people coming to their church
[57:34] buying their magazine
[57:37] buying their prayer books their prayer
[57:39] cloths
[57:40] you just send a love offering we'll send
[57:42] you out this whole set of tapes
[57:49] it's only 500 just cover
[57:51] you know the postage
[57:57] if we're supposed to teach others to
[57:59] observe all things whatsoever god has
[58:00] commanded us
[58:02] it's going to take more
[58:04] than just
[58:06] words brother branham said one place
[58:09] compassion is doing
[58:12] the will of god
[58:14] doing the will of god
[58:19] not talking about it not
[58:23] saying amen to it or i believe it
[58:26] it's actually doing it
[58:29] if we're going to teach others what
[58:31] god's perfect will is for their lives
[58:33] it's going to require sacrifices
[58:37] romans chapter 12 verse 1 says i beseech
[58:40] you therefore brethren by the mercies of
[58:43] god
[58:44] that you present
[58:46] your body
[58:47] a living sacrifice
[58:51] holy acceptable unto god
[58:54] this is
[58:55] your reasonable service
[58:59] my
[59:01] you go get your car worked on you you
[59:04] you you go into a restaurant you get
[59:06] service
[59:07] and all of us
[59:10] um
[59:12] things stick out to us if it's a real
[59:14] bad service it sticks out to us
[59:18] i'm not giving them a tip i'm not coming
[59:20] here no more i'm going to not put a i'm
[59:23] a bad review
[59:25] or if it's really good you're so excited
[59:28] that you just want to tell them
[59:32] now you would think laying down your
[59:34] life every day for god would be a
[59:36] top-notch service
[59:39] but god says that's
[59:41] just your reasonable service
[59:44] that's the least that we should to me we
[59:46] should be doing for god
[59:50] as a portable embassy present your body
[59:53] a living sacrifice
[59:57] and be not conformed to this world but
[59:59] be transformed by the renewing of your
[1:00:01] mind that you may prove
[1:00:04] what is that good and acceptable and
[1:00:06] perfect will of god amen
[1:00:08] what i love about this scripture is
[1:00:10] every day we all have a chance to prove
[1:00:12] what is the perfect will of god
[1:00:15] i know it's the perfect will of god for
[1:00:17] me not to steal
[1:00:19] to go rob
[1:00:21] to punch people
[1:00:26] and i can feel good that i'm in
[1:00:29] god's perfect will
[1:00:31] and neglect
[1:00:33] the great commission
[1:00:36] neglect to be an ambassador
[1:00:39] neglect the ministry of reconciliation
[1:00:42] neglect to be a portable embassy
[1:00:50] i
[1:00:51] i'm so glad
[1:00:53] god showed me one day that there's not a
[1:00:56] man on the planet that can keep me from
[1:00:58] serving him
[1:01:00] from the dictates of my heart
[1:01:04] it's okay if people don't want to give
[1:01:06] ain't going to stop me
[1:01:08] it's my relationship with god
[1:01:11] god is not going to reward you according
[1:01:13] to my labors
[1:01:17] and i am not going to receive any kind
[1:01:19] of reward from your labors
[1:01:24] we're all rewarded from our labors
[1:01:29] not that we do it for reward
[1:01:32] the only reward i want to i don't even
[1:01:35] want to hear anything of course i want
[1:01:37] to hear
[1:01:38] i want to make it in that's what i
[1:01:39] really want
[1:01:40] how do you feel like it's going to be
[1:01:42] well done i want to hear it i don't
[1:01:43] think i i deserve that
[1:01:46] i don't know what else to say that's
[1:01:47] just how i feel
[1:01:49] but i want to make it in there and i
[1:01:52] want to have the right garment on
[1:01:54] i don't want to be found getting kicked
[1:01:56] out because i had the wrong garment on
[1:02:02] turn with me to second timothy chapter
[1:02:04] four verse one these
[1:02:06] set of scriptures paul not only explains
[1:02:08] to timothy his responsibility as an
[1:02:10] ambassador but he also conveys to
[1:02:12] timothy what it's going to be like
[1:02:14] walking in a foreign country so just
[1:02:17] imagine yourself in liberia
[1:02:22] afghanistan
[1:02:25] especially now
[1:02:30] it would not be fun
[1:02:32] you'd be looking for refuge
[1:02:36] and so paul is trying to explain this
[1:02:39] to timothy
[1:02:41] in verse one he says i charge thee
[1:02:42] therefore before god the lord jesus
[1:02:44] christ who shall judge the quick and the
[1:02:47] dead
[1:02:48] at his appearing
[1:02:50] and his kingdom
[1:02:53] now every time we come to church
[1:02:55] god is appearing unto us
[1:02:58] he's bringing his judgment
[1:03:00] to our lives
[1:03:03] and why is he doing that
[1:03:05] it's because
[1:03:07] we don't want to be judged at the white
[1:03:09] throne judgment without mercy
[1:03:13] today we can come to church and be
[1:03:14] judged by the word
[1:03:16] with mercy
[1:03:18] his word isn't anything less and it's
[1:03:21] just the same
[1:03:22] as it is going to be on the white throne
[1:03:24] if you ever wonder what's going to
[1:03:25] happen on the white throne judgment he's
[1:03:27] he's going to judge according to this
[1:03:28] word the same thing we hear at church
[1:03:32] and when we accept the word
[1:03:36] into our heart
[1:03:37] lord i want to i want to obey it i want
[1:03:39] to become it i want to manifest it
[1:03:42] god gives you mercy today
[1:03:46] first peter chapter 4 verse 17 says for
[1:03:49] the time is come
[1:03:51] that judgment
[1:03:53] must begin
[1:03:55] at the house of god is that right
[1:04:00] and if it first began at us
[1:04:03] what shall the end of them that obey not
[1:04:06] the gospel
[1:04:08] in other words we have mercy with us
[1:04:12] and if the righteous scarcely be saved
[1:04:15] where shall the ungodly
[1:04:17] and the sinner
[1:04:19] appear
[1:04:21] we gladly come here we know god's
[1:04:23] mercies are here
[1:04:25] how is he going to judge the quick and
[1:04:27] the dead when he appears
[1:04:29] we can either be quick to hear
[1:04:31] say amen i want that for my life
[1:04:34] or we can just sit like a bump on log
[1:04:36] and be dead about it
[1:04:41] just
[1:04:42] it all depends
[1:04:44] on you primo agency your choice your
[1:04:46] desires
[1:04:49] i want to be quick
[1:04:52] i i may not make it home
[1:04:58] how many
[1:04:59] you know
[1:05:01] when i was young i used to gamble
[1:05:04] and i gambled quite a bit
[1:05:08] and i gambled a lot
[1:05:11] and i'll say it like this where all the
[1:05:13] whole world
[1:05:16] is a gambler of some
[1:05:20] sort anytime you put off doing something
[1:05:23] that god asked you to do today that's
[1:05:25] gambling
[1:05:27] god wants you to pray and you say i'll
[1:05:29] put it off no
[1:05:30] that's gambling
[1:05:36] all right i charge thee before god and
[1:05:39] the lord jesus christ you shall judge
[1:05:41] the quick and the dead and disappearing
[1:05:43] and his kingdom notice that word charge
[1:05:47] that's a strong word paul is charging
[1:05:49] timothy
[1:05:51] that word charge means demand certify
[1:05:54] with clear evidence before god
[1:05:58] a demand not an option
[1:06:01] it's a charge from heaven
[1:06:06] preach the word
[1:06:08] be instant in season out of season
[1:06:10] reprove rebuke exhort with all
[1:06:12] longsuffering and doctrine
[1:06:17] now don't think for a minute this is for
[1:06:19] preachers
[1:06:21] that word preach just means herald
[1:06:23] proclaim as a public crier
[1:06:26] the divine truth
[1:06:31] it's up to all of us to proclaim the
[1:06:34] truth
[1:06:37] as a portable embassy we need to always
[1:06:39] be ready to bring more of christ to
[1:06:42] others
[1:06:44] it doesn't matter if you feel like it's
[1:06:46] the season or not
[1:06:48] it's always the season to bring christ
[1:06:50] the word more to others
[1:06:52] doesn't matter if you feel there's an
[1:06:54] opportunity or there's not an
[1:06:56] opportunity
[1:06:57] help someone
[1:06:59] every one of us ought to be bringing
[1:07:01] christ to one another that's what it
[1:07:03] means to edify the church
[1:07:08] every contact every every conversation
[1:07:11] that you have with somebody there ought
[1:07:13] to be some sort of building going on
[1:07:19] if you can't do nothing except in your
[1:07:21] heart say god bless this man when i
[1:07:22] shake his hands
[1:07:24] inside lord
[1:07:27] how use me to help this person
[1:07:30] amen
[1:07:32] that's the only way
[1:07:34] that the whole body can edify itself
[1:07:39] it can't be just behind
[1:07:42] the pulpit
[1:07:44] right then everybody'd have to get up
[1:07:45] here and do it
[1:07:48] that's not what it means
[1:07:50] every content we have with somebody to
[1:07:52] me provides an opportunity to bring
[1:07:54] christ to them now we can either just
[1:07:57] blow it off and talk about ourselves
[1:08:00] or we can actually help that person
[1:08:06] you know brother branham said
[1:08:08] i'm starting to feel a little religious
[1:08:09] right now
[1:08:11] but it's a true saints we blow so much
[1:08:14] opportunity because we're interested in
[1:08:16] something else
[1:08:18] edify
[1:08:19] edify one another
[1:08:22] it starts with a compassion in your
[1:08:24] heart i want to see this person that i'm
[1:08:27] talking to a little higher in christ
[1:08:36] god is very serious
[1:08:38] about us growing
[1:08:42] and he wants to use one another he wants
[1:08:44] to use all of you to help me can you
[1:08:47] believe that
[1:08:50] so don't don't mess up an opportunity to
[1:08:52] help me
[1:08:54] i need you i want you to help me i need
[1:08:56] you to help me
[1:08:58] you young children
[1:09:00] i need you to help me
[1:09:03] christ and everyone
[1:09:05] helping everyone
[1:09:08] we need to see christ in one another
[1:09:10] we're spending too much time looking at
[1:09:12] the wrong things with one another
[1:09:15] trying to build ourselves or something
[1:09:17] we it needs to be all of christ in our
[1:09:19] church
[1:09:23] now we need to be instant
[1:09:26] that means be presently in the mind of
[1:09:29] christ walking in the spirit always
[1:09:32] ready to give an answer for the hope
[1:09:35] that lies within us
[1:09:39] reprove rebuke and exhort
[1:09:43] now harmony wants to be that kind of
[1:09:44] embassy
[1:09:48] sounds scary doesn't it
[1:09:51] that word reprove means to prove to be
[1:09:54] false i want you to think
[1:09:56] when you're coming to either somebody in
[1:09:57] the church
[1:09:59] or somebody that don't know the lord
[1:10:01] we're supposed to reprove rebuke and
[1:10:03] exhort
[1:10:08] i already made mention every one of us
[1:10:09] ought to be provoking one other good
[1:10:10] works that's just scriptural
[1:10:13] i don't care if you're young or old
[1:10:16] to reprove means to prove to be false
[1:10:19] to convince or to tell a fault
[1:10:23] that seems to be pretty easy we don't
[1:10:24] have no problem doing that one
[1:10:27] to rebuke means to tax upon
[1:10:31] to express a stern disapproval
[1:10:36] to exhort means to call
[1:10:38] invite
[1:10:40] beseech entreat or to pray about the
[1:10:43] situation
[1:10:47] so we see a need
[1:10:49] the first thing we have to do
[1:10:51] is convince the person that this is
[1:10:53] wrong
[1:10:58] hey if we care about the person
[1:11:01] if you truly care and you want that
[1:11:03] person to walk in truth
[1:11:05] you have to let them know that where
[1:11:07] they're at isn't truth
[1:11:10] and then you have to
[1:11:13] put a tax upon them
[1:11:15] that await to express a stern
[1:11:18] disapproval if i say to
[1:11:22] uh brother mark brother mark
[1:11:25] you have gone to the very end
[1:11:28] of my approval and the ties that you
[1:11:32] have been wearing here of late do not
[1:11:34] match
[1:11:36] now he's gonna walk home with a
[1:11:38] disapproval
[1:11:40] attacks upon him i need to be more
[1:11:42] careful about the ties i put on for
[1:11:45] brother john
[1:11:49] and then
[1:11:50] we as christians
[1:11:52] we call we invite we beseech we entreat
[1:11:56] we provide the answer
[1:12:00] amen
[1:12:01] pray about this look in the mirror
[1:12:05] green doesn't always match orange
[1:12:08] pray about this
[1:12:11] you understand what i'm trying to say
[1:12:16] the problem with a lot of portable
[1:12:17] embassies is that they don't
[1:12:19] have the life
[1:12:21] of the word
[1:12:22] inside
[1:12:24] in other words they can tell a fault
[1:12:26] they can prove something is wrong or
[1:12:28] they can sternly disapprove of somebody
[1:12:32] but they don't know how to have the
[1:12:33] right spirit about it
[1:12:37] they don't know how to do it with
[1:12:38] patience and long suffering
[1:12:41] they don't want to take the time to
[1:12:42] really help somebody
[1:12:44] they just have enough time to prove that
[1:12:46] somebody's wrong about something
[1:12:52] but this
[1:12:54] is not a god's portable embassy
[1:13:03] when this happens repeatedly
[1:13:06] it shows
[1:13:08] their motive
[1:13:09] is wrong
[1:13:11] they're not looking through eyes of
[1:13:12] compassion
[1:13:14] they're looking through eyes critical
[1:13:16] eyes
[1:13:19] i really you know what every time i have
[1:13:22] interaction with everybody
[1:13:26] i'm staring at how much
[1:13:29] they care
[1:13:33] i don't judge him on that
[1:13:35] but you know we all know this
[1:13:37] we'd rather know when somebody is
[1:13:40] speaking something to us we'd rather
[1:13:42] know how much somebody cares about us
[1:13:44] than how much they know
[1:13:47] is that true
[1:13:49] we all want to be
[1:13:51] cared for
[1:13:52] loved
[1:13:54] if you're my brother
[1:13:56] if you're my sister
[1:13:58] help me
[1:14:03] well brother you're the pastor
[1:14:06] and and
[1:14:08] what scripture are you talking about
[1:14:11] pastors don't need help
[1:14:14] no they're just bombarded with
[1:14:16] everything but they don't need help
[1:14:21] they carry everything they deal with
[1:14:22] everything
[1:14:24] and they don't need help god bless
[1:14:26] this couple here
[1:14:28] coming
[1:14:30] and just having a burden
[1:14:34] that meant so much to me
[1:14:37] we need burdens one for another
[1:14:46] we need to check our motives
[1:14:51] we don't want to be too proud to think
[1:14:52] that
[1:14:53] we couldn't be wrong about something
[1:14:57] now paul taught timothy to re reprove
[1:14:59] rebuke and exhort the right way
[1:15:04] as a portable embassy you must do it
[1:15:06] with
[1:15:06] all long suffering
[1:15:10] what if all you're going to do is just
[1:15:12] tell
[1:15:13] you know brother roger
[1:15:15] you need to wear shoes in the church
[1:15:20] that's all you're interested in doing is
[1:15:21] just telling somebody when they're wrong
[1:15:24] there's no need to be long-suffering
[1:15:28] but you have to do it with
[1:15:29] long-suffering so you have to do it in
[1:15:31] such a way that he may keep wearing
[1:15:38] body without the shoes into the
[1:15:39] sanctuary
[1:15:41] but you you have a vision
[1:15:44] you know eventually
[1:15:46] those shoes are going to be on that feet
[1:15:50] that's what long suffering's for
[1:15:54] and
[1:15:55] doctrine scriptural instructions
[1:15:59] so we need to be fortified i'm just
[1:16:01] going to talk about that word long
[1:16:02] suffering it means to be fortified with
[1:16:05] forbearance
[1:16:07] in other words self-restraint
[1:16:10] to have strength enough to handle the
[1:16:13] situation with proper grace
[1:16:18] it means to have patience enough to
[1:16:20] teach others with humility
[1:16:23] now this is the way a portable embassy
[1:16:26] works
[1:16:27] come on
[1:16:29] in other words you possess self-control
[1:16:32] you're not rude you're not arrogant
[1:16:35] you're not mean about it your motive is
[1:16:37] pure compassion
[1:16:40] hallelujah you're not interested in
[1:16:42] hurting people
[1:16:44] and if you do you do something about it
[1:16:48] something inside of you just wants
[1:16:50] things to be right
[1:16:53] it's the love of god in your heart
[1:16:58] colossians chapter 4 verse 5 says as a
[1:17:01] portable embassy walk in wisdom
[1:17:04] toward them that are without
[1:17:07] redeeming the time
[1:17:10] don't putts around
[1:17:12] don't lay around
[1:17:15] don't be talking about
[1:17:16] things that are just
[1:17:17] meaningless
[1:17:20] you know you only have a little time to
[1:17:22] help me
[1:17:23] and i'm still waiting for you to come
[1:17:25] and help me
[1:17:27] redeem the time
[1:17:30] what about your brother your sister
[1:17:32] those that you live with
[1:17:33] why do we say oh god's got to do that
[1:17:35] god's got to deal with it god's got to i
[1:17:37] can't
[1:17:39] that's not
[1:17:42] scriptural you've got to have faith to
[1:17:44] help you got to have so much faith in
[1:17:46] god that god inside of you can help
[1:17:48] somebody
[1:17:52] you can't say i'm a portable embassy in
[1:17:55] the working and you know we're under
[1:17:57] construction right now and one day you
[1:17:59] know i'll be
[1:18:01] uh ready you know to to go out and help
[1:18:03] my brothers and sisters
[1:18:06] that only last so long
[1:18:11] the bible says
[1:18:14] we ought to
[1:18:15] we ought to be teaching
[1:18:17] and we have need that one would teach us
[1:18:20] the first principles of the oracles of
[1:18:23] christ
[1:18:25] in other words there's things that are
[1:18:26] persuaded of us by god
[1:18:30] we should be further along
[1:18:32] time's running out we need to redeem the
[1:18:34] time amen
[1:18:35] let your speech be always with
[1:18:40] truth
[1:18:42] no
[1:18:43] it doesn't say that does it
[1:18:46] it says let your conversation
[1:18:48] be always
[1:18:49] with grace
[1:18:52] and then season it
[1:18:54] put a little seasoning in there
[1:18:58] season it with salt you are the salt of
[1:19:01] the earth
[1:19:02] you're the light of the world
[1:19:05] let it shine
[1:19:06] let people taste you
[1:19:10] that ye may know
[1:19:12] how you ought to answer every man
[1:19:14] every man not just those that are less
[1:19:17] spiritual than you
[1:19:20] every man
[1:19:23] every man that means you must have all
[1:19:25] of god to deal with all of men
[1:19:29] don't think you're incapable
[1:19:32] all you need
[1:19:34] is
[1:19:34] love compassion
[1:19:40] paul not only commissions timothy with
[1:19:43] proper authority but he lets him know
[1:19:45] it's not
[1:19:46] it's not going to get easy er it's going
[1:19:49] to get worse in the world
[1:19:50] things are going to wax worse and worse
[1:19:54] we're going to feel more and more as
[1:19:55] time goes on that we're in a foreign
[1:19:57] country every month that goes by things
[1:19:59] are more crazier
[1:20:02] like
[1:20:03] my daughter was telling me last night
[1:20:06] it's not getting hard to be praying
[1:20:09] for lord jesus come
[1:20:14] just done done with this place
[1:20:20] second timothy chapter 4 verse 3 says
[1:20:22] for the time will come
[1:20:25] when they these are believers
[1:20:28] will not endure sound doctrine
[1:20:32] but after their own lust
[1:20:34] simply means after their own desires
[1:20:37] they shall heap or accumulate
[1:20:40] to themselves
[1:20:42] teachers having itching ears
[1:20:47] people
[1:20:50] think they have enough truth
[1:20:52] to get by
[1:20:55] so they become
[1:20:57] picky and choosy of what they want to
[1:20:59] hear
[1:21:03] that's why it'd be better to come to
[1:21:05] church
[1:21:06] and say lord
[1:21:08] i know that i'm lacking i know that i'm
[1:21:11] needy i know there's something in my
[1:21:13] life that you want me to have god open
[1:21:15] my eyes to see open my ears to hear
[1:21:22] we're going to face the facts when most
[1:21:24] people come to church they want to hear
[1:21:26] what they want to hear
[1:21:29] they may not say it out loud but it's
[1:21:30] the truth
[1:21:32] but when the bride comes to church she's
[1:21:34] longing to know how to be more in his
[1:21:36] image
[1:21:40] how to possess
[1:21:41] more of the nature of her husband
[1:21:44] because she wants to be like him
[1:21:46] how to live the life of the word that's
[1:21:50] actually being preached to them
[1:21:53] we don't come here for information
[1:21:57] we come here for the life of the word
[1:22:00] and they notice these people and they
[1:22:02] shall turn their ears
[1:22:04] away
[1:22:05] turn their ears from the truth
[1:22:08] and shall be turned onto fables
[1:22:12] now fables are just something
[1:22:14] that
[1:22:15] isn't all
[1:22:17] truth
[1:22:21] i don't care what science fiction thing
[1:22:23] you've ever looked at there's an element
[1:22:25] of there that's of truth that you can
[1:22:28] relate to because that's how it grabs
[1:22:29] you to go there
[1:22:32] i mean planet of the apes when i was a
[1:22:34] kid i used to watch them
[1:22:35] i had dad you got to take me to these
[1:22:37] things we go to sit there
[1:22:39] go out
[1:22:40] have the big drive in put the thing
[1:22:42] inside you know
[1:22:48] well there's apes on the earth there's a
[1:22:49] reality there
[1:22:52] and the whole world knows that you know
[1:22:53] there's there's some sort of
[1:22:56] at one time they used to talk or
[1:22:57] something
[1:22:59] something there to grab you
[1:23:02] but we know there's a missing link for
[1:23:04] sure
[1:23:08] so the word when when satan gets this
[1:23:11] off track
[1:23:12] he'll give you some truth
[1:23:15] that's okay you got enough you don't
[1:23:17] have to dig in anymore
[1:23:21] hey if you're really elect you know
[1:23:28] yeah if you're elect you're going to
[1:23:29] make it that's amen
[1:23:31] but if you're also elect you're going to
[1:23:33] dig in
[1:23:35] you see what i'm saying it's in which
[1:23:37] how that spirit is coming across
[1:23:43] and as much as
[1:23:48] god is amongst us
[1:23:51] we already know
[1:23:55] satan is not going to leave us alone
[1:23:58] he's going to look for an open door
[1:24:01] to try to get in there
[1:24:03] to rock us asleep
[1:24:06] but you know what we got to get out
[1:24:07] there we got to be a portable embassy we
[1:24:09] got to go out there and tell others
[1:24:11] about jesus
[1:24:13] we got to redeem the time the time is
[1:24:15] short
[1:24:20] so there's an element of truth that you
[1:24:22] can relate to but there's a portion
[1:24:24] that's not
[1:24:25] true and people in the churches are
[1:24:27] turning
[1:24:28] from the truth they they want
[1:24:29] entertainment
[1:24:31] they want the lights flashing they want
[1:24:33] the music going
[1:24:35] they want to feel a good time
[1:24:42] what if
[1:24:45] christ is trying to tell us that
[1:24:48] he wants to be more in her life
[1:24:53] that takes a dying out to achieve that
[1:24:54] to have that
[1:24:57] why wouldn't we rather sit here and be
[1:24:59] entertained
[1:25:01] you understand and if we when we come to
[1:25:03] church we're in the flesh for in the
[1:25:05] spirit it's up to us to get out of the
[1:25:06] flesh
[1:25:09] because the flesh always wants i i the
[1:25:11] flesh always wants my flesh is no
[1:25:13] different than your flesh
[1:25:14] all flesh is the same
[1:25:18] it's just it's all bad
[1:25:21] it's all bad
[1:25:22] don't be satisfied with how much of
[1:25:25] christ you have
[1:25:27] long for the fullness of his nature to
[1:25:30] be able to bring christ to every single
[1:25:31] person with all your conversation with
[1:25:34] all your behavior
[1:25:38] verse 5 but watch thou in all things
[1:25:43] endure affliction do the work of an
[1:25:45] evangelist make full proof of thy
[1:25:47] ministry
[1:25:49] do the work of an evangelist
[1:25:53] this means be a portable embassy
[1:25:57] and we're all called
[1:26:01] get out there win souls
[1:26:04] bring souls to the truth of the hour
[1:26:08] think it would be wrong in this age to
[1:26:10] bring souls
[1:26:11] to martin luther
[1:26:13] message
[1:26:16] you have to start there
[1:26:18] but you don't be satisfied there
[1:26:21] motive has got to bring them to the word
[1:26:24] of the hour because they're living in
[1:26:26] this age
[1:26:29] make full proof of thy ministry in other
[1:26:32] words don't just preach it make full
[1:26:35] proof
[1:26:37] your life
[1:26:39] becomes the word that you're preaching
[1:26:41] your behavior how you interact how you
[1:26:43] handle things are you talking with grace
[1:26:45] are you full of compassion
[1:26:47] make full proof of your ministry
[1:26:51] not partial proof
[1:26:54] bring souls to christ
[1:26:56] there's my proof
[1:26:58] come on now don't get quiet on me
[1:27:04] people are attracted
[1:27:06] to the life of the word
[1:27:08] inside of you
[1:27:11] not to the verbality
[1:27:13] it's a new word i made up
[1:27:17] to the life of the word
[1:27:20] good example to me of a portable embassy
[1:27:22] is we heard a little bit about it in our
[1:27:24] our men's meeting last wednesday and a
[1:27:26] little bit
[1:27:27] here in this in the service
[1:27:30] uh that brother bruce had ministered but
[1:27:32] i wanted to take a little bit further in
[1:27:33] saint john chapter four starting with
[1:27:35] verse 24.
[1:27:37] now there was a woman of samaria and she
[1:27:40] was at the well
[1:27:41] he says i must needs go by there as a
[1:27:44] portable embassy
[1:27:46] and jesus told her that his father is
[1:27:48] seeking true worshipers let's pick it up
[1:27:50] in verse 24 god is a spirit they that
[1:27:52] worship him must worship him in spirit
[1:27:54] and in truth
[1:27:56] and the woman saith unto him i know that
[1:27:58] when that the messiah cometh which is
[1:28:01] called christ he when he has come he
[1:28:03] will tell us all things
[1:28:06] now
[1:28:07] jesus said
[1:28:09] in verse 26 i
[1:28:11] that speak unto thee am
[1:28:14] he
[1:28:16] at that moment god revealed to her who
[1:28:20] jesus was
[1:28:23] i that speak unto thee am he upon this
[1:28:26] rock i'll build my church something
[1:28:29] happens when christ is revealed to us
[1:28:32] now we understand why jesus felt led
[1:28:34] that he must needs go by samaria
[1:28:38] i want us to recognize what happened
[1:28:40] after god reveals himself to her in
[1:28:42] verse 27 and upon this came his
[1:28:44] disciples and marveled and they talked
[1:28:46] with that he talked with this woman yet
[1:28:48] no man said well what seeketh thou or
[1:28:52] why talk his doll with her
[1:28:54] the woman then left her water pot
[1:28:57] and noticed and went her way
[1:29:01] the same way that she always went her
[1:29:03] way
[1:29:04] into the city
[1:29:07] but she had a different motive this time
[1:29:10] and say it to the men
[1:29:12] come see a man which told me all things
[1:29:15] that i did is not this the christ
[1:29:20] now christ revealed to her
[1:29:24] and now as a portable embassy
[1:29:28] come see
[1:29:29] this same christ
[1:29:32] that's why we have to go out
[1:29:36] because jesus
[1:29:40] isn't here in a mortal body anymore
[1:29:45] he is in the his body of believers
[1:29:50] doing the same works
[1:29:52] in fact he said greater works
[1:29:55] shall you do because i go to my father
[1:30:00] so he calls us to be a portable
[1:30:02] embassy for him
[1:30:04] come see i'm sure everybody didn't come
[1:30:10] and we're living in an age where the
[1:30:11] evil is just as worse as it's ever has
[1:30:14] ever been
[1:30:16] so not many are going to come but should
[1:30:19] that take away the compassion that we
[1:30:20] have in the heart for those that are his
[1:30:23] i believe the bible says that god
[1:30:25] doesn't have and take any pleasure in
[1:30:27] the death of the wicked he will that all
[1:30:28] men would be saved
[1:30:30] and where is that nature inside of us
[1:30:34] when we're laying on our beds
[1:30:36] when we're praying in a prayer closet
[1:30:40] something inside should be stirring
[1:30:42] redeeming the time
[1:30:44] to get out there let others know that
[1:30:46] this thing is real
[1:30:48] not have this uh intellectual attitude
[1:30:51] of well if if they're elected or god
[1:30:53] somehow he's gonna
[1:30:56] what are you gonna do you might as well
[1:30:58] tear this out of the bible moses tara
[1:31:00] the great commissioner of the bible
[1:31:02] take out the words
[1:31:03] go ye out and put in there
[1:31:06] he'll bring them in
[1:31:09] come on
[1:31:11] may not want to hear it
[1:31:12] let's say it anyways
[1:31:14] because here's the thing the devil is
[1:31:16] the one that preaches that to us
[1:31:19] because that way we can sit comfortably
[1:31:21] in church in the message and say i'm a
[1:31:23] message to them that i'm safe
[1:31:26] glad you're safe
[1:31:28] care about the others that are not
[1:31:32] god give us time to to get through
[1:31:34] this message today
[1:31:38] she went her way but she had a different
[1:31:40] motive this time
[1:31:42] go home today with a different motive
[1:31:46] share jesus with somebody
[1:31:50] if you're not sure what to do say jesus
[1:31:53] loves you come to church
[1:31:56] jesus loves you come to church
[1:31:58] let them get in the presence of god
[1:32:01] then you make sure you pray for them
[1:32:03] very much that when they come to church
[1:32:05] they will feel the presence of god amen
[1:32:10] she didn't wait around after she got in
[1:32:12] contact with god
[1:32:14] she didn't wait around
[1:32:16] waiting
[1:32:17] for other believers to come to her
[1:32:21] she went out
[1:32:22] as a portable embassy
[1:32:25] she brought the good news
[1:32:27] to whoever would hear the same spirit
[1:32:29] that willed the disciples to go e out
[1:32:32] and preach the gospel
[1:32:34] that same spirit was now
[1:32:37] moving inside of her
[1:32:39] she was moved by compassion hey listen
[1:32:42] this is just about me you need to come
[1:32:44] and hear this man
[1:32:47] amen
[1:32:49] she was moved with compassion
[1:32:51] the love of god because there are souls
[1:32:54] that need to be saved
[1:32:59] how about you do you feel obligated
[1:33:01] today
[1:33:02] do you feel the spirit of god moving you
[1:33:05] to go out
[1:33:07] let god
[1:33:08] use your body
[1:33:10] to be a portable embassy
[1:33:12] i i told brother mark yesterday i
[1:33:14] believe it was yesterday
[1:33:16] how proud i was of him
[1:33:18] of his reaching out
[1:33:21] and i'll say every single one of you
[1:33:24] that are taking time to reach out to
[1:33:26] somebody i'm proud of you
[1:33:30] that's what we need to be doing
[1:33:33] fighting against this flesh that just
[1:33:35] wants everything to be easy
[1:33:38] like we want an audience
[1:33:41] go give jesus to somebody
[1:33:44] go give jesus to somebody
[1:33:48] let your spirit now become
[1:33:51] an ambassador for christ
[1:33:54] beseeching others to be reconciled
[1:33:57] to god in a greater way it's okay if
[1:33:59] somebody has christ
[1:34:01] they can have
[1:34:02] more now then we are ambassadors for
[1:34:06] christ as though god did beseech you by
[1:34:08] us we pray you and christ said be
[1:34:10] reconciled to god what an honor it is to
[1:34:13] bring christ to somebody it is just an
[1:34:15] honor
[1:34:18] it isn't
[1:34:19] our knowledge
[1:34:21] that constrains us to go
[1:34:23] it's not our wisdom
[1:34:25] it's not our talents it's not our gifts
[1:34:27] it's not our abilities
[1:34:29] second corinthians chapter 5 verse 14
[1:34:31] says for the love of christ constrains
[1:34:34] us
[1:34:36] not all those other things
[1:34:38] doesn't matter about the talents and the
[1:34:39] abilities
[1:34:41] we need the love of christ
[1:34:43] that's what constrains us because we
[1:34:46] thus judge that if one died for all then
[1:34:48] we're all dead
[1:34:51] and that he died for all that they which
[1:34:53] lived should not henceforth live unto
[1:34:55] themselves
[1:34:57] but unto him that died for them and rose
[1:35:00] again
[1:35:02] amen
[1:35:03] when you really sink your teeth
[1:35:06] into what christ has done for you
[1:35:12] you don't feel like you're your own
[1:35:14] anymore
[1:35:16] that you're governed by a different will
[1:35:22] the love of christ constrains us to
[1:35:24] reach out
[1:35:25] to others
[1:35:27] what's god love
[1:35:29] doing in your hearts today
[1:35:32] are you looking for people to come to
[1:35:34] you
[1:35:35] are you looking for the easier path to
[1:35:37] share christ
[1:35:40] come on
[1:35:41] just be be honest with me i i am not
[1:35:44] pointing any fingers
[1:35:46] just kidding
[1:35:49] but i want you to be honest
[1:35:52] are you looking for the easier way to
[1:35:54] bring christ to somebody
[1:35:59] brother branham said in the message
[1:36:01] running from the presence of the lord he
[1:36:02] says but it's the e but it's easy to go
[1:36:05] the way
[1:36:06] the world
[1:36:08] goes
[1:36:09] i would imagine if we preached the
[1:36:11] gospel that made everybody feel good we
[1:36:13] would probably have more people here
[1:36:14] today
[1:36:17] i think so if we had more entertainment
[1:36:20] more laughter
[1:36:21] more fun more enjoyment more coffee
[1:36:24] donuts type of thing
[1:36:26] we would have more
[1:36:28] because that is appealing
[1:36:33] he said it's easy to go the way the
[1:36:35] world goes
[1:36:37] he said but christianity is an everyday
[1:36:40] rugged life
[1:36:41] living for god in this present world
[1:36:44] he said it's a constant burning of the
[1:36:46] fire and the love of god in the heart
[1:36:48] that sets you of fire
[1:36:52] it's the fire of god
[1:36:54] that sets you on fire
[1:36:57] not just i have the fire of god but i'm
[1:37:00] you're not set on fire
[1:37:05] the fire sets you on fire
[1:37:10] there's a difference between
[1:37:13] you
[1:37:13] holding a picture
[1:37:15] of a fire
[1:37:18] and walking around like this
[1:37:20] and saying i've got the fire of god
[1:37:25] versus
[1:37:26] you being lit
[1:37:32] up it's a constant burning
[1:37:36] not a sundays and wednesdays
[1:37:38] and i'm i'm i am challenged on here i'm
[1:37:42] challenged
[1:37:44] this is not i'm here and you're not
[1:37:47] this is
[1:37:48] lord help us all to get there
[1:37:51] it's a constant burning of the fire in
[1:37:53] the love of god and heart that sets you
[1:37:54] of fire and puts you out yonder notice
[1:37:57] put you out yonder not lord bring people
[1:38:00] to me give me an opportunity put you out
[1:38:04] yonder
[1:38:06] with
[1:38:07] people
[1:38:08] people
[1:38:10] where there's people their souls
[1:38:12] and what do you do with those people
[1:38:15] make converts to christ
[1:38:18] wow
[1:38:19] you mean so much for friendship
[1:38:21] fellowship following get i can't do any
[1:38:24] of that i can't just hang out and have a
[1:38:26] good time
[1:38:30] no
[1:38:31] that's not the commission
[1:38:33] now i know this is a strong word but it
[1:38:35] cannot get any simpler than this
[1:38:38] it can't get any simpler
[1:38:41] he says but you must accept your
[1:38:43] responsibility
[1:38:45] it's a reason brother brandon's calling
[1:38:46] it a responsibility
[1:38:49] the same thing paul was telling timothy
[1:38:54] and the responsibility that that god has
[1:38:56] given us in this day
[1:38:59] is to bring this message
[1:39:02] this message
[1:39:05] this message
[1:39:06] that's strong
[1:39:08] and as i get older
[1:39:10] and i know my days are shortening up
[1:39:13] i feel the responsibility greater than
[1:39:15] i've ever felt
[1:39:17] pressing on he said we must do it we
[1:39:21] must get down to it in everywhere we go
[1:39:25] and tell the message
[1:39:27] and tell the people
[1:39:29] that jesus is coming amen
[1:39:31] i love the simplicity of the message
[1:39:34] come see a man that told me all things
[1:39:37] jesus is coming
[1:39:38] because if they really
[1:39:40] i'll tell you i remember laying on my
[1:39:42] bed
[1:39:43] knowing that if i did not give my heart
[1:39:46] to jesus
[1:39:47] i was going to hell
[1:39:48] something inside of me just knew
[1:39:51] that i had to give my life to god
[1:39:54] and if you just tell people jesus is
[1:39:56] coming soon it's the same thing as
[1:39:58] saying um
[1:40:00] you're you're going to be
[1:40:02] you're going to be dying
[1:40:04] next week and you need to get your house
[1:40:06] in order you need to make sure you take
[1:40:07] care of the important things in your
[1:40:08] life
[1:40:11] because when jesus comes it's all over
[1:40:13] it ain't like he's coming and then we're
[1:40:14] going to go on with our life
[1:40:16] so by simply letting people know jesus
[1:40:18] is really coming
[1:40:20] soon god will be doing the work in their
[1:40:23] heart
[1:40:26] and that he's god and he's coming soon
[1:40:28] and there's not a hope left in the world
[1:40:31] but the coming of the lord
[1:40:35] i know i've read this message or this
[1:40:37] quote a few times
[1:40:41] but i think it's something we just can't
[1:40:43] let it slip a little bit too much
[1:40:47] the love of god
[1:40:49] is shed abroad in their heart by the
[1:40:50] holy ghost that's why i say we need to
[1:40:52] pray more
[1:40:54] it's not about studying and knowledge
[1:40:56] it's about getting on your knees and
[1:40:58] having god move you

[1:41:29] female young or old rich or poor it
[1:41:33] doesn't matter if you're smart not smart
[1:41:35] talented not talented
[1:41:37] we've all been called and elected
[1:41:40] to bring christ more to the next person
[1:41:44] understand the calling there
[1:41:46] it's it's a responsibility but everybody
[1:41:49] don't take it seriously
[1:41:52] like you know it's like it's more
[1:41:54] private
[1:41:55] it's not you're you're like public
[1:41:59] you're for the public
[1:42:01] that's what that word preacher means

[1:42:41] and to be encouraged that our labor is
[1:42:43] not in vain

[1:43:01] think was the dinner table with both of
[1:43:02] you
[1:43:03] i regret not spending more time laboring
[1:43:06] for the lord
[1:43:11] because everything that i have spent for
[1:43:13] myself
[1:43:14] is in vain

[1:55:30] how much power you have
[1:55:32] until you step out in faith
[1:55:34] faith is the groundwork
[1:55:38] it's done for us
[1:55:41] a couple years ago before i retired we
[1:55:43] were in the city truck going out to a
[1:55:46] job site
[1:55:48] i was bothered because
[1:55:50] i had been into brother branham's
[1:55:53] teachings and that
[1:55:55] and he always said that you think this
[1:55:57] is just for me it's not amen it's for
[1:56:00] you too
[1:56:01] if you can get in that channel amen
[1:56:04] that's right i thought that's true but
[1:56:06] things like he did and it was about the
[1:56:08] colorado storm
[1:56:11] i was
[1:56:12] going through that over and over and i'm
[1:56:13] thinking
[1:56:14] man that's hard you know amen that if
[1:56:16] god would call him back up to the top of
[1:56:18] the mountain to speak to him and tell
[1:56:20] him to speak to the storm speak to the
[1:56:22] storm amen
[1:56:24] and i thought that's for prophets it's
[1:56:26] not for me
[1:56:28] but i was under strong conviction
[1:56:31] right along in that truck and i was
[1:56:33] getting goose bumps and i knew something
[1:56:34] was going to happen
[1:56:37] and uh
[1:56:38] the lord spoke to me he said open your
[1:56:40] mouth and speak
[1:56:43] and i thought real quick you know
[1:56:45] trying to cover my tracks
[1:56:47] lord i don't know what to speak he said
[1:56:50] open your mouth make an utterance i'll
[1:56:51] speak through you
[1:56:53] i thought that's easy now so i opened my
[1:56:56] mouth
[1:56:57] and spoke made another utterance all i
[1:57:00] did was made another
[1:57:02] uh
[1:57:04] i heard him talk he spoke through me
[1:57:06] amen fellas we'll go up here to maple
[1:57:09] we'll go up here we're on a hill road
[1:57:11] coming out front we'll go up here to
[1:57:13] jennings road make a right turn we'll go
[1:57:15] down toward the airport when we hit
[1:57:18] maple roll we'll make a left turn
[1:57:21] and as we
[1:57:23] along the woods so big woods on that
[1:57:25] north side
[1:57:26] and
[1:57:27] said
[1:57:29] when we cross over that little bridge or
[1:57:31] that little creek and we come to the
[1:57:33] edge of the woods we'll see
[1:57:35] a field
[1:57:37] to the right side

[1:57:51] and he'll be grazing grass
[1:57:54] my boss says
[1:57:56] well we'll see
[1:57:58] right so he turned he went down the
[1:58:00] maple rose made a left turn we went over
[1:58:02] the bridge and he slowed down as we come
[1:58:04] to the edge of the field
[1:58:06] to about two miles an hour and the boys
[1:58:08] in the backseat are jumping over my
[1:58:09] shoulders looking around
[1:58:12] i saw the hedgerow
[1:58:14] we moved along real slowly and as we
[1:58:17] cleared the woods there was a deer
[1:58:19] standing sideways broadside
[1:58:22] with his head down crazy amen my boss
