TRANSCRIPT
========================================
need more love of god we don't have enough and that's what i appreciate about that song until i have all i know that i need more so i'm in the same boat as sister hope this morning needing more of the love of god and i believe that he has a lot for us amen amen we we can never out love the lord i also wanted before we begin to read our scripture i wanted to say thank you to my wife for for for keeping me for 40 years i want to say happy anniversary to her it's been god's grace i like to say that everything was a bowl of cherries um but i can testify of one thing god's grace is amazing and uh and i just appreciate her and her grace towards me as well amen turn with me if you would to the book of ephesians chapter two so we want to do a part one part two and experiencing god's love and in part one this morning we want to uh simply title this receiving god's love the subject receiving god's love and uh i just trusted to be a blessing to you men before we begin reading in verse one let's look to the lord in prayer and just ask his grace now heavenly father we thank you for your presence lord we thank you that each one of your children brought a part of you with them this morning that we could all of us enjoy more than what we have because of you inside of one another so we thank you for your great presence this morning and lord we pray that you would come even in a greater way that we all could feel you in a greater way and experience you and have more of you lord than when we came that's why we come to receive more of you i pray lord that you would receive our sacrifice this morning of praise of thanksgiving of love and appreciation to you what you've done for us may be so pleased with that sacrifice that you come and consume it and fill us with the holy ghost this morning lord fill us with a greater portion of your love lord i ask that you would meet all the needs that would be amongst us today lord you know every one of them lord we just commit ourselves to you we know we come to the right source you're able to do exceedingly above lord whatever we'd ask lord we thank you for bringing our our sister hope back lord brother ron has already testified the many prayers that have gone out in his behalf lord we thank you for finding brother ben's wallet lord lord we thank you for our visitors that have come to sojourn with us this morning lord we we have so much to be grateful for lord thank you for keeping sharing i together lord by your grace lord we we thank you for this church lord we thank you for lord what you're doing in this church and this body and the whole work of the ministry of send the light lord we we thank you for the work you've started lord we know that you'll you'll finish it because that's the god that you are we love you lord we pray your blessings now on the reading of your word for we ask at all and give you the praise in jesus christ precious name amen amen ephesians chapter two starting with verse number one through five amen and you have a quickened who were dead in trespasses and sins wherein in time past ye walked according to the course of this world according to the prince of the power of the air the spirit that now worketh in the children of disobedience among whom also we all had our conversation in times past in the lust of our flesh fulfilling the desires of the flesh and of the mind and we're by nature the children of wrath even as others but god who is rich in mercy for his great love wherewith he loved us even when we were dead and sins have he quickened us together with christ by grace ye are saved amen god bless you may be seated amen the greatest thing a sinner can experience is the love of god being expressed to him through the forgiveness of his sins when god for his great love wherewith he loves a sinner and shares his rich abundant mercy with him his grace saves him amen from god's own wrath and some what a paradox that god's wrath is on man and yet his love saves them from that wrath it's the same god has the same thing he's provided away for every sinner amen the greatest power sinner can experience is receiving the love of god when i grew up i was led to believe that people like charles manson adolf hitler bonnie and clyde joseph stalin saddam hussein were evil horrible people and as long as i didn't steal from other people and i didn't rob banks as long as i didn't murder as long as i wasn't a serial killer i would be okay i would be considered a good person now that's what i was led to believe by my parents by those around me in fact it was so good to hear that you're a good boy just it reinforced it you know what i'm saying but just because i wasn't one of those evil hated hateful people that left blood in the pages of history doesn't mean i wasn't of that same nature that same evil selfish nature i just didn't know it i was blind thinking i was not evil or bad i actually thought i was an okay person but the bible says we all had our conversations in times past in the lust of our flesh fulfilling the desires of our flesh and of our mind and we're by nature the children of wrath in other words when you didn't get what you want you got mad it didn't matter if it was your brother your sister your best friend your mom and dad in your eyes you were number one and when you didn't get what you wanted you let everybody know as a sinner i didn't know god i didn't care about god in fact i didn't even know if there was a god that existed the only reason i thought i was happy was because i didn't realize i was a sinner that i was lost or that i was hopeless i never thought long enough that if god did exist what would he think of me or what would happen to my soul i didn't know that i was born as a beautiful sinner baby they all thought i was a blue-dyed cutie but i didn't know i i was being raised and shapened in iniquity i didn't know it was actually was a bad person that there was no good in me there was no spiritual good in me it was just a selfish nature i was like everyone else who only cared about others to a point and soon as that point got crossed i didn't care anymore in other words it's a conditional point then i learned about god who so loved the world that he gave himself for me i learned that there was no one good there was none not not one jesus himself there's none good but god paul said in romans chapter 3 verse 10 as it is written there is none righteous no not one and i don't believe that paul was referring to those people that were outside of the church there is none that understand there is none that seeketh after the god they are all gone out of the way of god they all together become unprofitable for god there is none that doeth good no not one their throat is an open septic septicer with their tongues they have used deceit you got to do that to get what you want you know the poison of ass is under their lips whose mouth is full of cursing and bitterness their feet are swift to shed blood destruction and misery in their ways and the way of peace they have not known there is no fear of god before their eyes i can relate to the scriptures i was spiritually dead in sin in trespasses i was i was selfish i walked according to the course of this world according to the spirit of disobedience i did what my parents told me to do but i wasn't interested in doing wish i didn't have to do it my nature was like that wouldn't tell my dad that he couldn't get beat but that's how i was inside i run to every concert i could get to i bought all the worldly music i could afford i partied and drank and took and sold drugs i gambled and did things that can only come forth from an evil selfish nature come come forth from god and there was no fear of god before my eyes as i fulfilled the desires of my flesh and did what i wanted to do and i i feel okay sharing this with you because i know every one of you we're the same way so you can relate i was in the same boat as all those evil people i learned about when i was younger i was heading for the same place as every other rotten person on the earth was going but god who is rich in mercy for his great love with he loved me he loved me he showed me i was a sinner that's love when god shows you where you've sinned that's love he showed me i was a sinner just like the rest of them i was heading straight to hell he showed me that jesus christ is the only way to end up not going to hell he showed me because he was he loved me with his great love that he was full of mercy he had mercy from me he had grace for me to save me from his wrath the bible says even when we were dead in sins heavy quickness together with christ by grace are you saying i think it's important for us to understand this verse especially for tonight's service so often we think that we're saved because there's something favorable about us something special about us and and yes we are a part of god we were a part of god but you know we need to realize that if that's all we think about then we don't feel so indebted to god but we were without god we were aliens to god we didn't care about god we only wanted what we wanted and god looked beyond that and he said i'm going to die for his sins and that love on a grip or heart the love of god was projected towards me and sovereign grace took over my life mercy rerolled my life i began to experience freedom from my past oh how liberty liberating it was to feel free from sin and i wanted everyone to know his name is jesus he'll be your friend he's human as as well as divine oh i want you to know him this wonderful friend of mine in the message divine love and sovereign grace brother branham said and when divine love has been projected and comes to its end its destination sovereign grace will then take over and in one place he talks about them just paraphrasing but whatever love was projected for grace goes and gets it it finishes the job for god so loved the souls of this world that he projected divine love and gave himself amen greater love have this greater love have no man than this than a man lay down his life for his friends jesus projected the greatest love there is nothing greater and that's why calvary should never feel oh to us yeah i've been saved so long yeah i reckon hey that's old news to me let it stay fresh in your life [Music] he created himself god created himself in the human flesh first timothy chapter 3 verse 16 first timothy chapter 3 verse 16 and without controversy great is the mystery of godliness god was manifested in the flesh john chapter 1 verse 14 and i'm so sorry we got so many scriptures that we're just we kind of need to to go through quickly please for forgive me sometimes it's it just uh i don't make it easy to have like bible study sometimes because i just got so much and you just please bear with me but john chapter 1 verse 14 says and the word was made flesh and dwelt among us and we beheld his glory the glory is the only begotten son full of grace and full of truth and i want us to catch this that god was manifested in the flesh full of grace and full of truth god became man that we might become him what a paradox god became man that we that we might be saved from the raft that is to come god projected his divine love towards us by giving us his only begotten son and when that divine love came to its end came to his destiny yes that love came to its destiny it was on the cross jesus said it is finished you know what happened then sovereign grace took over sovereign grace took over it it met its end love meant its destiny it is purpose jesus come that he might save the world can you say praise the lord now when i was blind to my evil nature and dead in my sins god's sovereign grace took over he quickened me together with christ by grace he saved me amen i met grace when i experienced the love of god and i think we all can say that today we all met grace the love of god was expressed to us because he i don't i do not understand why he didn't save everybody else i knew i talked to a lot of people about god and they just whatever i just why me why get my attention why how is it inside of me that i believe you god that's good why is it everybody else is just like it's a thought it's an idea it's a theory it's a picture it's a story it's a book it's a history why to me is it real lord it's the grace of god today it's the grace of god he gives his eyes to she said blessed are your eyes they see blessed are your ears they hear blessed is your heart it understands the greatest power a sinner can experience is when he receives forgiveness for his sins there's nothing greater he paid a debt he did not all i owed a debt i could not pay i needed someone to wash my sins away and now i sing a brand new song amazing grace all day long that's right never forget calvary amen he paid the debt at calvary he cleansed my soul and set me free i'm glad that jesus did all my sins a race i now can sing a brand new song amazing grace christ jesus paid a debt that i could never pay you know we don't just sing that song the day we get saved [Laughter] we don't sing come into my heart come in today come in to stay you know before we get saved you know we gotta think about the words that we sing in these songs we need to invite more of the love of god into our lives amen now we understand that god loves everybody amen he has no pleasure in the death of the wicked the bible says he even loves his enemies that's something to think about he maketh the sun to rise on the evil and the good and he sentenced reign on the just and the unjust god loves everyone but he doesn't save everyone think about that he loves everyone but he doesn't save everyone first timothy chapter 2 verse 4 who will have all men to be saved and to come to the knowledge of the truth showing the heart of god god wants everyone to be saved he wants everyone to come to this knowledge that you and i enjoy that we praise god every day for the light that has come in this age our eyes to see the scriptures more plainly john chapter 5 verse 39 jesus was giving some very important instructions to the world he says search the scriptures for in them you think you have eternal life but the are what testifies the truth it's the scriptures that's all we have it's like that song that ann sung which i loved i loved the words of that song it's not a tearful motion it's not some man's theology it's the word of god and this word if it doesn't hit inside of our hearts it does no good you can have a thousand of them lined up on your shelves you can literally listen to it daily but if it never enters into the heart it will do you no good that's why we got to search the scriptures now look at verse 40 and ye will not come to me that you might have life see the little ingredient that has to happen to receive more of god's love you actually have to put a step towards him draw nigh to god he'll draw an eye to you come to him and you'll get more i don't think god would ever ever not reward those that diligently seek him the bible said he's a rewarder if we could get time frame out of the of the way like i prayed yesterday nothing happened i prayed for three days now i still haven't heard from him excuse me where's that in the bible i've searched the scriptures and i haven't i haven't found that brother ron i have found that all he does all things beautiful in his time his time not my time can you imagine if those that were in the upper room only stayed for 30 days they left and they said oh that's hogwash he never kept his word he told me to go wait in jerusalem i did he never came they went around told everybody you cannot mix your thoughts with the word of god the word of god says it i believe it amen it's going to happen and we must believe like that as soon as we inject our our thoughts and time and this is the way it's got to go if it don't go like this and i must just stay with the word stay with the word jesus is full of compassion he's full of grace he's full of mercy jesus is today the mercy seat today god loves everyone but he doesn't save everyone romans chapter 9 verse 13 as it is written jacob have i loved but esau have i hated now he loves everyone the same so what is this that he hates esau he must be looking at how esau is responding to his love in other words god will change his mind if you don't accept his love he would that all people are going to be saved but they're not going to be so somewhere in that time called grace we've got to respond to his love we've got to say be it unto me according to thy word lord and let that love fill your heart because it will do something to you verse 14 what shall we say then is there unrighteousness with god god forbid for he saith to moses i will have mercy on whom i have mercy and i will have compassion on whom i'll have compassion so then there's not of him that willeth or him that runeth but is god that showeth mercy amen it sounds like to me if you want to find favor with the teacher you better bring an apple class you can't sit around and expect god just to be show favoritism towards you because your name is john martin it just don't work like that the bible says that he dwells among them that are a humble and contrite spirit and he kind of he resists those that are arrogant and proud and got it together and they got you know laodicea is very arrogant and proud they're in need of nothing you can't tell them anything they don't need another leave leave me alone the way i am well god resists that spirit that's why he says i counsel thee to come by of me go try it in the fire get the eyes off so you can see better because you're not looking at things correctly so only god is going to allow us to enter in to a rapture you're not going to grab god and i'm going no matter what no it's god if i'm pleasing to you if i found favor with you if my life is lining up with your word i'm doing everything you told me to do i know i'm not doing everything i know i'm going to go to church and i'm going to learn more what you want me to do lord what we do is when we go to church we you know our flesh wants to make church different than what it's really supposed to be but think about it you're taking the precious time that that you that god has made for him to speak to you about what he wants and you're making it all about what you want you listen to those prophecies that come on brother branham's tapes you notice those prophecies never talk never express never tell the people to just you know really bite in to the discernment and the healings they say listen to my profit listen to the word listen to the message because that is why he sent him we're here today for the word that god has for us and yes we have needs and yes we want god to meet those needs but put him first put him first put his word first all other things will be added amen all right what verse are we on verse 17 for the scripture saith unto pharaoh even for this same purpose have i raised thee up that i might show my power in thee and that my name might be declared throughout the earth therefore have ye mercy on whom you have mercy and whom he will hardeneth but i will tell you this that god will never ever manipulate somebody's will god is such a gentleman he will never cross the will of man he has such respect that's why he lets lucifer go let the third of angels you want to go go and he'll let every man that doesn't want to serve him not serve them they won't like the choice they made at the end but he's not going to stop him now it's up to the love of god inside of every one of us to plead with the souls of other people that this is the hour that you have a chance to turn things around because the way that you're thinking the enemy has polluted your mind and thinking that there is no end to this the bible says that in romans chapter or second corinthians chapter four that satan has blinded the minds of them that believe not it's up to us to send light when adam and eve sinned in the beginning the lord god made coats of skin and clothed them can you imagine you ever put on a coat take it off or look at it where it was made who made this where is this made take your shirt can you imagine taking cold off and said made by god god made these clothes for adam and eve he had to take off their man-made clothes put on clothes made by god just like the shoes that the children of israel wore for 50 years those shoes were made by god they were blessed by god if i could say it like that god makes a difference god is able to make his grace abound towards whom whomsoever he chooses and god called them and you know what he did after he clothed them he drove them out of the fellowship and he placed at the east of the garden chairmans and a flaming sword which turned every way to keep them from the tree of life think about it he clothed them he kicked them out he put cherubians and he guarded life he said i'm going to have mercy on whom i'm going to have mercy right there it started in the garden god later made a tabernacle in the mildred wilderness and he placed inside the holiest of holies a mercy seat and he didn't just let anybody go in there and anytime that you went towards that without the blood it would kill you because god is the one that chooses who's going to get mercy you want mercy be merciful you want mercy humble yourself you want more of god search the scriptures i'm so glad that i have the revelation today brother mark that i need more of god amen that i don't have enough what a revelation to have that means i got a chance to get more that's what that means without that you don't have a chance i thought i was saved i thought it was okay i didn't know i was going to hell god had to show me i was a sinner before i realized it a perfect type of god's mercy today is jesus christ man cannot obtain mercy without the blood of calvary and jesus is the only way to obtain mercy from the wrath of god jesus said unless you believe i am he you'll die in your sins unless you believe i am the mercies of god you're going to die in your sins we need to humbly receive him humbly keep receiving more of him i think that's important to get because we all feel here today i've been saved so what's this sermon for come on you know what the devil's going to tell you chapter 1 verse 11 he came to his own and his own received him not they turned they turned him down god blinded them to give you and i a chance don't ever look down on the jews if it hadn't been for god's grace you wouldn't be here today look how it happened but as many as received him to them gave the power to become i love that to become the sons of god even to them that believe on his name which were born not of blood nor of the will of the flesh nor of the will of men but of god nobody had anything to do with it mom dad preacher the person that witnessed to you it was god through them think about that this is the amazing thing about god is he's going to share that with you in glory that's right but see because think about this it's not you're not separated from god you're part of god so it's okay they that when souls is wise you're a part of god you're not taking the glory for yourself it has nothing to do with you it's god in you amen that's why we need to he told the disciples to wait till you get endured with power from on high because he i god was saying i know how to win a soul i know what it takes i know how to lay down alive i know how to go to through persecution i know how to keep going and not stop when you're getting eggs thrown at you rotten eggs when god love calls us to himself we need to respond we need to receive that love when god wants to deal with something in our lives we've got to receive that receive that respond to that respond back and say yes god i want to follow what you're saying help me when god wants to build some more character inside of us we need to let go and let god have his way we can't be saying not now lord we don't want to miss our day of visitation our time of visitation we need to take the word of god more serious we need to look beyond flesh we need to look beyond john martin we need to look in the spirit and see god here this morning it's god loving us and it's an honor and a privilege to be loved by god now to you that feel that you're saved and you've already got the love of god i want to say that we backslide every day we come short of god's glory now god just doesn't stand by and do nothing about it when you do that aren't you glad he doesn't just let you do it and stand by and do nothing as if he doesn't care no he cares about you he cares about what you're doing or what you're not doing he cares if you're not praying and he wants to do something about it he deals with us he loves us enough to deal with us to speak to our heart to speak to our conscience and what greater thing could we experience being out of close fellowship with jesus being not connected to that by not bearing the fruit of the holy spirit than god forgiving us of our shortcomings of our sins of our unbelief our iniquities our transgressions what greater thing can we experience than to be forgiven quietly i don't think there's a thing that we could experience any greater when we're out of fellowship is him coming and saying i love you get back in line psalms 19 the great chapter that the prophet took the rapture message from and at the end of this david is speaking in verse 12. psalms chapter 19 verse 12 he said who can understand his heirs wow i don't even understand my errors i you know the obvious if i punch somebody i mean i got it that's a wrong one i shouldn't have done that but what all the other ones that i do and i think it's okay to get away with right who can understand his heirs cleanse thou me from secret faults brother john you mean to tell me you got secret faults no i did it that was david david was saying not me well to be honest with you we all got them we all got them what do i do well let's read keep back thy servant from presumptuous sins and let them not have dominion over me then shall i be upright and i shall be innocent from the great transgression let the words of my mouth the meditation of my heart let it be acceptable in thy sight oh lord you're my strength and you're my redeemer presumptuous you know what that is arrogant proud laodicea not a big deal i'm okay with what i'm doing dave is saying keep me back from that keep me from that let it not not not spirit that attitude have a dominion over me the greatest thing a sinner can ever experience is the love of god being expressed to him through the forgiveness of his sins and and and and david wanted to stay in harmony with god and he knew at any second at any time that could slip i think one place david said i hide thy word in my heart that i not sin against thee when god for his great love we're with he loves a sinner and shares his rich abundant mercy with him his grace saves him from god's own wrath the greatest power a sinner can experience is receiving the love of god jesus said in revelation chapter 3 verse 19 as many as i love i rebuke and i chasten be zealous therefore and repent so when god loves you you know what's coming next right god's divine love changes a man it turns them around and gets them going in the right direction now the world wants to be loved without having to change love me the way i am let me do what i want to do let me remain the way i what i i want to be a girl and you better love me that's the way the world thinks they want to be loved without changing we call that human love that's really called human filial love but god's divine agape love never wants you to remain in your corruptable nature he wants us to keep pressing for more and more of his divine nature just to keep pressing not i got enough until i have all i know that i need more what a revelation now god has so much love the bible says that god is love but he's always pointing us closer to him he's always pointing us in a direction that's closer to him he's always watching us with the water by the word his ministry is bringing us to perfection through the guidance of the holy spirit now how does he do it john chapter 16 verse 13 says how be it when the spirit of truth has come he will guide you into all truth and verse 8 says and when he is come he's going to reprove the world of sin and righteousness and of judgment god is leading us to become more of him he is not leading us to more doctrine but to get rid of the world that's inside of us because god's not going to share his glory with the devil that's why we got to die that's why we got to surrender all so we can receive more of god now god loves us so much that he is 100 percent of the time guiding us closer to him it doesn't matter what's going on what we're doing his mind is to get us closer to him he speaks the truth in love we repent we turn from the direction that we're moving and we start heading more in his direction i say it like this more in this direction because we're not 100 perfectly moving in the right direction that's what the spirit's for you know honestly our flesh can't stomach it he says i have many things to say to you but you can't bear it now why a lot of times people get so fed up with coming to church and hearing that what they need to be doing more because their flesh can't bear it but if they would ever get serious about getting the holy ghost that holy ghost can bear it that holy ghost will lead and guide them into all truth now regardless if you repent or not regardless if you turn around or not god is always pointing people closer to him i want to take a look at the rich young ruler the bible says that jesus had compassion on him and he directed him towards walking in the truth but he turned it down and he walked away from jesus who was full of mercy full of grace full of compassion and he turned him down but what was jesus trying to do now jesus knew what decision he'd make because he's god but he still had compassion on him you know jesus didn't walk away from that situation and say oh well he's not following me i guess he'll just find it down it's you know joe's house he turned down his only chance jesus is the only way the only truth the only life and he comes and speaks to us in many different forms many different ways still the same god you may go by and and and see something you may hear something and all of a sudden god just speaks to your heart you know it's him don't turn it down say yes lord so be it lord i'll i'll follow you lord when a human experiences god's love that love always points him in the right direction now even though god was pointing this rich young ruler in the right direction he rejected it so i'll say it like this it's up to each one of us as individuals to accept god's love to accept his direction and i do believe this that every time we come to church god shows us where we're at on the map we know the rapture is where we're going but he shows us every time we come to church where we're at on the map and we need to know where we're at on the map if we're going to get to where we're going imagine if google maps came up and all it did was point you where the rapture's at but you didn't know where you were at right everything else was just whited out didn't know what city what oh okay i'm in fenton but if all you're knowing is where to go you don't know what state what country nothing so we need to know where we're at in the map in relationship to where we're going that's why we come to church to find out where we're at there this is one of the great mysteries of god's divine love he's always pointing us closer to him to receive more of him if it's just up to us to receive that matthew chapter 9 verse 35 and jesus went about all the cities and villages teaching in their synagogues and preaching the gospel the kingdom and healing every sickness and every disease among the people but something happened when we saw the multitudes he was moved with compassion on them because they fainted and they scattered they were scattered abroad as sheep having no shepherd look how jesus is describing the people the situation there was no leadership for their souls no direction for their souls and today people they think they don't need it it's the saddest thing that's true laodicea is filled with so many people who don't need what you have to offer them the bible tells me that we have this treasure in our earthen vessel we have the words of life they're not our words now they're god's word at one time peter could look at jesus when he asked are you going to leave also and he said thou alone has the words of eternal life but after the day of pentecost peter had the words whatever you might on earth i'll bind in heaven and he could share christ with the people why is it that the attitudes of people today they don't feel they need anything more than what they got they don't realize they're heading down the wrong path lord help us then he saith unto his disciples the harvest truly is plenteous but the laborers are few in other words there's a lot of people out there a lot of people that need leadership for their soul they maybe don't need it for anything else they probably do too but you know what's important is not what job we have how much money we get how many houses we have what matters is that our soul is being led towards christ that's all that matters that means more than all the money you could make whatever you could attain to no matter what popularity and friends and whatever if you don't have that leadership and don't depend on yourself think about this i depended on myself before i knew god and look where that got me ain't that the truth brother ron we thought we were fine just the way we were and you know those religions out there they try to teach you that you're fine you're okay you're gonna make it that's why you don't go to funerals ever go to a funeral and they say you know what this one didn't make it you never go to funeral and here they didn't make it they all make it but it doesn't line up with the word jesus said many go to hell and only a few make it but see the concept that world religion wants us to have is no matter what we do we're going to be okay that's why when you hear that spirit get away from it flee from it flee to the altar and say god fill me with more of you i need more of you he says pray ye therefore the lord of the harvest that he will send forth laborers into his harvest i think we need to pray that i mean i think we need to pray that god would send forth people into the field to get souls now remember god's great love that he had for saul before he became paul jesus said for i will show him how great things he must suffer from my namesake now what is his namesake why did he have to suffer that's his bride the bride takes the name of the bridegroom and he had to suffer many things for for the souls for souls if you're going to get a soul you're going to have to suffer if you think you're going to do it through cards and baking and phone calls and just nice little gestures hey that's what the world does doesn't bring any conviction and i'm not saying a cup of cold water given in the name of the lord will not be unrewarded but what i am saying is you got to be willing to get your hands dirty you got to be willing to get into things in people's lives that they don't want you to get into they don't realize they need to take care of them that's what discipleship is about that's what bringing people to christ is getting people ready for a rapture it was the grace of god that met saul on the road in damascus paul experienced god's love when he got ejected off his high horse what was the first thing that god did he showed him that he was wrong the first thing it's okay when the conviction of the holy spirit comes in church and shows you you're wrong you're right in harmony where god wants you to be because before before you came in you weren't in that harmony you were just fine you know how good it feels having a great week nothing's bothering you you're doing what you want to do why can't it be that way in church well there are churches like that in fact you can leave being entertained you can feel good build up your self-esteem feel like a million bucks be just as much a sinner when you leave probably morsel because you never come into the realization of your need but when you realize the need now you have a chance for the love of god to do a job inside of you because just being loved by god isn't good enough you gotta let it come in let it be expressed inside because it will do something for you god who is rich in mercy for his great love wherewith he loved saul right in the middle of him being part of all the killings he quickened him god quickened him grace came in and took over and saw his life praise the lord that's when grace met saul remember when grace and mercy met the woman that was caught in adultery after the word finished dealing with her accusers in john chapter 8 verse 10 when jesus had lifted up himself and saw that none but the woman he said to her woman where are those thine accusers have no man condemn thee and she answered no man lord and jesus said unto her something these men could have said but they didn't have the love of god in them he says neither do i condemn thee go in sin no more she experienced the love of god when jesus forgave her jesus is full of grace he's full of mercy he's full forgiveness god who is rich in mercy for his great love we're with he loved this woman even when she was in the very act of sin god forgave her think about how rich god's love is the greatest thing a sinner can ever experience is the love of god being expressed to him through the forgiveness of sins no greater power can a sinner experience than when he receives the love of god a sinner as a sinner nothing can compare with being forgiven by god and i'll say we need to experience it more we need to feel like we need it more turn with me if you would to luke chapter 7 verse 36 we're just about getting ready to close here i want us to look at the effect of what continual forgiveness happens in a person's life because that's where we're all at right luke chapter 7 verse 36 and one of the pharisees desired him that he would eat with him and he went into the pharisees house and sat down to meet and behold a woman in the city which was a sinner when she knew that jesus said at meet in pharisees house brought an alabaster box of an ointment and stood at his feet behind him weeping began to wash his feet with tears and did wipe them with the hairs of her head and kissed his feet and anointed the i'll say it like this i can see this was a perfect setting of humility this woman felt unworthy to be in the presence of jesus now when the pharisee which had bitten him saw it he spake within himself saying this man if he were a prophet would have known who and what man or woman that it is that touch him for she is a sinner and jesus answering said unto him notice uh it was in himself that he was speaking these were thoughts and the answer simon i have somewhat to say about the thoughts that you're having and he just said pretense okay master sayon said there was a certain creditor which had two debtors the one owed 500 pence in the other 50 and when they had nothing to pay he frankly forgave them both tell me therefore which of them will love him most simon answered and said i suppose that to he to whom he forgave most and he said unto him thou has rightly judged and he turned to the woman and said unto simon notice he turned to the woman and said unto simon sees thou this woman i entered into thine house and though gave us me no water for my feet but she had washed my feet with her tears and wiped them with the hairs of her head i think it'd be kind of hard for some of these modern day women who shave off off their hair thou gave us me no kiss but this woman since the time i came in have not ceased to kiss my feet my head with oil thou didst not anoint but this woman have anointed my feet with ointment wherefore i say unto thee her sins which were which are many are forgiven isn't that wonderful now look at this for she loved much but to whom little is forgiven love's little so if we sit around thinking all the time i don't need to be forgiven i'm okay the way i am you're just setting yourself up to love little but the more you can say i need you lord i need to be forgiven you're setting yourself up to be filled with a greater portion of god's love and he said unto her thy sins are forgiven to whom little is for littlest forgiven the same loveth little look at the effect that of continual forgiveness has on a person even simon answered correctly who didn't have god knows that you're gonna love more if you're forgiven more it's okay to be humble it's okay to be needy it's okay to just say i i i need you jesus you're setting yourself up to love more than those people who i've already been forgiven my sins are in the past first john chapter 3 verse 1 behold what manner of love the father have destroyed upon us that we should be called the sons of god therefore the world knoweth us not because it knew him not now think about what manner of love the father has put on you think about every time that you ask god to forgive you and it's not just repetition oh it's time to pray god ask god to forgive me oh yeah no but you feel from your heart you feel bad that love swelling up inside of you your indebtedness to god your appreciation to god amen romans chapter 4 verse 6 we are closing even as david also described the blessedness of the man unto whom god imputeth righteousness without works blessed are they whose iniquities are forgiven and whose sins are covered blessed is the man to whom the lord will not impute sin think about that god has mercy on whom he's going to have mercy god is going to love who he's going to love when you get time read romans chapter 4 verse 17-24 i don't have the time that i would like to today we're going to get into another part of god's love this evening so i just want to finish this up with three scriptures i want to encourage you today to receive more of god's forgiveness receive more of god's love i'll say pray for god's love pray for more of god's forgiveness you need to believe that you'll receive romans chapter 5 verse 5 and hope maketh not a shame because the love of god is shed abroad in our hearts by the holy ghost which is given unto us we all stand here and have hope for more of the love of god we all pray when god forgives us we hope that he forgives us well hope maketh not a shame the love of god is shed abroad in our hearts by the holy ghost so i'll say it like this if you want more the love of god seek more of the spirit of god it's that simple keep receiving more and more of god's great love jude the only chapter can you imagine if i said jude chapter 5 it's june chapter 1 verse 21 keep yourself in the love of god looking for the mercy of our lord jesus christ unto eternal keep yourself in the love of god amen let's stand together thank you for your patience this morning and those of you that love the word praise the lord i say praise the lord keep receiving god's love amen when i look into his holiness amen [Music] when i look into his holy name when i gaze into his loveliness when all things that surround me

you i worship you the reason i live is to worship you i worship you i worship you the reason i live you worship you one more time when i look into your holiness when i gaze into your loveliness when all things that surround me come shadowed in the light of you when i found the joy of reaching your heart when my will becomes enthroned in your love when all things that surround me come shadowed in the light of you i worship you i worship you the reason i live is to worship you i worship you i worship you the reason i live is to worship you amen praise you lord let's sing majesty i want you to think about when god reached down his hand for you amen he's worthy of all praise amen [Music] majesty worship his majesty unto jesus he all glory honor and praise [Music] majesty a kingdom of authority flow from his throne unto his own his anthem raised so exalt lift up and hide the name of jesus
