preaching lord only you can make it real to us amen we pray lord that you take full control lord of our very spirit of our hearts and our minds and lord also of any other spirit that would try to make its way into this uh room and the service to those that would be listening to try to get us to question or doubt the pure word of god pray that you'd bind up every spirit of doubt every spirit of unbelief every reasoning imagination and anything that would try to exalt itself against the very true word of god today lord pray that you give us a revelation that we may walk away here better equipped lord to carry out the very purpose that we are living today lord to spread your gospel we thank you for these things we commit now all of our needs into your hands lord may you come and minister to each and every one now in jesus precious name we pray amen amen god bless you good to see everyone here today and uh certainly good to see our visitors tony and i'm not sure your name phil god bless you we we welcome you here today and good to see our brother ferguson back and um good to see sister trina was able to make it mr sunday and just good to be together as a family amen turn with me if you would to the book of romans chapter 14 for our opening scripture also wanted to say good to have our daughter anne back from her trip romans chapter 14 we're going to start with verse number 10. the scripture says but why does thou judge thy brother or why does thou said it not thy brother and he gives us this warning about those thoughts for we shall all stand before the judgment seat of christ let's drop down to verse 16 let not then your good be evil spoken of your good intentions your good words your good the evil spoken of for the kingdom of god is not meat and drink but it's righteousness and peace and joy in the holy ghost for he that is in these things serveth christ is acceptable to god and approved of men let us therefore follow after the things which make peace and the things were with one may edify another god bless you may be seated we want to talk about discipling and we just really want to talk about the very basics of discipling um i i believe often we get away from the very basics we forget about the basics and we try in our way to disciple now this doesn't matter if who we're trying to disciple if they know god don't know god if they're um know a little bit about the word or they've been in the message for 30 years these principles are the same so whatever you want to apply it to they're the same of course it may seem like it's harder to talk to certain individuals than others and try to get perhaps sometimes family uh to to to receive what you're you're you're trying to help them with but um we must be bold about discipling discipline is very important i think sometimes we can be scared or afraid about discipline but that what we're going to say is going to backfire on us like it did before right you ever you ever you ever tried to to to disciple somebody and and it just kind of blows up in your face all of a sudden you're being attacked sometimes uh we're without courage because the way others will probably respond to us when we go to disciple them sometimes we're lacking confidence in our ability honestly to properly disciple somebody that's true i like to entitle this message discipline 101 very basics we're all called to disciple one another turn with me if you would to luke chapter 22 and uh verse 29 and and take a look at uh some words that jesus had told peter here i believe we can put herself in the same category we're all called to disciple one another so i don't care your age you are called to disciple me amen i don't care how much you know i'm called to disciple you it doesn't matter age nothing matters we're all the body amen to help one another and all of us at one time or another are trying to disciple somebody in the church and uh probably more times than not it turns into a flop right it didn't just turn out there's a misunderstanding taken the wrong way and sometimes we should be discipline somebody but we're too afraid it's not my responsibility and we're way off base way off base we need to wash one another's feet so here he says in verse 29 jesus says and i appoint unto you a kingdom as my father have appointed unto me that he may eat and drink at my table in my kingdom and sit on the throne judging the twelve tribes of israel and the lord said simon simon behold satan have desired to have you that he may sift you like wheat but i prayed for thee that thy faith they will not and when thou art converted you've got a job to do and that's the strength in thy brethren strengthen them in the word and peter said unto him lord i'm ready right now i'm ready to go with thee both into prison and to death i i am just so on fire and jesus said i tell you peter the shall not crow this day before thou shalt thrice deny that thou even knowest me wow there's a lot that can be said in these verses but we don't want uh to be so sure about something that we couldn't be wrong i think it would have been good for peter to have a little bit of humbleness here when god's trying to speak to him jesus was trying to speak to him here now there are a lot of different interpretations of what it means to be converted if we search the scriptures as we're taught to by jesus he told us to a person can be called of god he could walk with jesus put yourself in these shoes here follow his teachings sent out two by two to preach salvation receive revelation from heaven be used of god to cast out devils to heal the sick and all manner of diseases and still not be converted now that's just scripture because peter did all these things and he still wasn't converted yet more emphasis needs to be put on a full conversion that's right not just being used by god but a full conversion now the scriptures do teach us what a complete conversion is it goes way beyond these things into a complete nature change second corinthians chapter 5 verse 17 makes it very clear therefore if any man be in christ if any man be converted completely converted he is a new creature all things are passed away behold all things have become new and all things are now of god we just don't go from one rock band to another rock band we don't go from worldly rock bands to christian rock bands all things have become of god who have reconciled us to to himself by jesus christ and given to us the ministry of reconciliation of course that's that's strengthening our brother and helping others to christ so we have to be looking beyond just the well i'm going to preach to somebody i'm going to tell somebody i'm gonna it goes way beyond all that amen and i'm talking about the basics you know brother branham taught us that god is hidden simplicity we're looking for god out here and he's he's he's down here he's he's much closer much simpler he's not complex so even though peter was called walking with the message of the hour and was elected to even judge at the judgment bar he didn't have the complete nature change yet right this is important because we all believe we're elected so it's it's not oh yeah i'm going to be judging at the judgment bar oh yeah i'm ready to die for you jesus it's where you're at right now it's okay if jesus gives us a revelation of our future but that doesn't mean we're at where we need to be right now it was even hard for peter to accept that his spirit wasn't completely ready he still had a little satan in him his spirit wasn't willing to even and suffer called it out and said get behind me satan that's not right you got to be willing to suffer for me his spirit wanted to call down fire from heaven and devour others his proud spirit rejoiced over the fact that spirits were subject to him the devils were subjective and he rejoiced in that and he forgot about his salvation it was the grace of god that peter was saved jesus said one day you shall know that i am in the father and you and me and i in you but that day wasn't quite there for peter and i'm afraid that day hasn't arrived for some of us as well jesus could see exactly where peter was and where his walk was with the father peter you're going to have a major battle with the devil he wants to sift you as wheat the devil don't like what you're doing and the reason he wants to sip just like weep if he can sift us like wheat before we have the nature change we'll never have it if he can get our mind just on doing this or doing that and not worry about the nature change see the nature change is the absolute most important thing for a christian and it doesn't happen be just because of how many days we go to church you got to get serious with how much you hate the old man amen got to get to a place where i'm more concerned about getting this thing out of the way so god can have his way with my life the holy ghost of god is the only thing that can bring about a complete nature change a man at his very best is all vanity now what the holy ghost does and what that nature change does is it changes your very motives in life who you're going to live for are you going to spend time building your own life or are you going to spend time strengthening others because that's what eternal life is it's actually living for others you're no longer talk thinking about strengthening yourself you you're or you spent that time with the lord you're you're on fire for god and now you want to strengthen others the holy ghost changes the way you help others the way you go about handling situations the way you go about discipling this word strengthen means if you look it up it means to turn resolutely in a certain direction so jesus tells peter you're going to strengthen your brethren you're going to turn your brethren in a certain direction that they're not going what are we doing when we're trying to help one another in church there's some problem there's some flaw there's something going on and we want to help this person we're wanting to turn them in a right direction that's strengthening our brethren it means to establish or set fast in a certain direction so we want to establish them in the right way to turn resolutely means i had to look that up means to turn our brethren in a determined or firm manner in other words we have to be brave and decisive and unwavering about it we have to be determined it has to be when you disciple somebody you can't be wishy-washy about it you got to be firm important but firm doesn't mean to be blunt coarse rude abrasive insulting obnoxious or roughing matter that's not what firm means you can be firm and determined without being rough and rude with your messages when your holy ghost is determined what's inside of you when it is determined you will want to see that person that you're talking to changed amen how many times i've had seven children and i don't know how many times in my life i thought i wish they would just stop that's annoying me i wasn't really interested at the moment about taking time to teach them i just wanted to stop because it's annoying sometimes brothers and sisters do things to annoy us we just want them to stop but we're missing the holy ghost to help we don't got because it takes time he that teacheth got to have patience got to have patience you want to help one another in here i'm sorry you just can't go up to him and say your tie's crooked knock it off you've got to take time discipline is so much deeper amen but yet it's so simple is corrective but it's not rude it is an abrasive in spirit or rough or insulting in behavior love is corrective but it doesn't do ill to its neighbor nor will it even think it the same love that corrects is also kind it's long suffering and it's able to bear the burden until our brother or sister sees it think about that you know we want to do a drive up to the mcdonald's window get our hamburger get out of there and start eating we want to go up to something and say this is it this is what you move on that's why this is called discipline 101 because that never works it just causes more problems more divisions more isms and schisms and we need the true love of god the same love that corrects has faith to believe for a restored situation remember that we got to get away from this i just want them to stop it's wrong that ain't good enough amen see it through what if that was your spouse right you'd probably put a little bit more time into it where was your your old flesh and blood brother what if it was your best friend you can't have partiality when you're discipling amen jesus never said when thou art converted strengthen your best friends when thou art converted strengthen thy brethren don't try to show off like peter did remember he just wanted to be the greatest one don't try to convince others that you're willing to die for the lord or go to prison don't even do that don't try to express how how much you're ready right now that didn't get the job done for jesus i won't get it done for him today when was the last time you turned your cheek for someone who hurt you because obviously when somebody hits you automatically you know and they can just be hitting you with words you automatically know it's wrong help the person don't just tell them it was wrong they already know it was wrong think about this we need what it takes to strengthen one another when was the last time you went out of your way to help someone you dislike the last time you wash somebody's feet instead of talking about how dirty they are see we come so short of discipline because we got it all up here but we need to get it here right here this is where true discipleship comes from it comes from the heart i really don't care how much you know how much god can use you i really want to see you strengthen your brethren to turn your your brethren resolutely in a better position than where they're at and it's all of our responsibilities don't turn them towards you but turn them towards a better relationship with jesus christ and it ain't just saying this is what you're doing wrong this is what you should be doing if you do you have a better relationship with that's not it that's what peter had let's draw the sword let's see what we got to do we're going to get through this problem but he wasn't going to lay down his life and that's what it takes to truly disciple knowledge of someone's heirs would just puff us up but love will edify and strengthen them so what do you need do you need the knowledge of their sin the knowledge of their faults the knowledge of their heirs no we need the love to take care of it and when we just want to walk away not deal with it don't know what to do what you need to be recognizing is what's missing in your life why are we going to judge another someone else we're called to edify i know how to do it but get on your knees and get serious with god because after this situation you've got another brother you've got another sister you're going to be disciple until you're out of here when it comes to discipline others whether they know nothing about god or they're deeper into the message of the hour it still requires the same humble loving yet firm approach with your spirit remember it's not knowing the truth about somebody's heirs it's about helping them your knowledge doesn't help them now if i come to you and i say to you i've got this problem i just blow up and yell at my boss every day and i don't know what to do you got an open door but if i'm at a spot in my life that you know i yell at my boss all the time but i think i'm okay because he's wrong then you don't got that open door just to tell me right stop yelling at your boss now you're gonna have to disciple me now you're gonna get your hands dirty you're gonna have to come with a spirit that helps me or else i'm just going to turn you off i think that's why a lot of people get afraid of trying to disciple one another because they don't know how right i don't mean to be so frank but it's much more truer than what we realize what good does it do if you know somebody's heir but you don't have a plan to help him right satan knows all of our errors puts us in the same boat with him he don't got any plan to help us he knows our heirs and you know what he does with the knowledge of our heirs he condemns us he's the accuser of the brethren that's what he does with the knowledge of our heirs and what do we find ourselves doing with the knowledge of one another's heirs may not do it out loud we're missing l-o-v-e agape love we're missing i need to help this person because satan's back there he wants to get just two of you yell and get bitter at one another have things against one another you just stand back and go like this he wants to whisper in one another's ear but who's going to stand up and say lord i want to strengthen i want to be a peacemaker i want to help because it's going to take something greater than your reputation something greater than your knowledge it's going to take the holy ghost in action amen a good way to look at discipline someone is that you're actually restoring them whether they know the truth or they know a lot of truth whatever you're trying to disciple you're trying to restore them back to the truth jesus is the truth he's the way the truth the life and discipling others is restoring them to christ not telling them this is what christ wants you to do discipline 101 now even though we've been given the word of reconciliation to restore others we never use the letter of the law to do it amen and every one of you should say amen a thousand times on that because that's what that's how we try to restore one another we give them the word word word word word the letter killeth but the spirit is what gives life so we don't want to give them the letter of the word we want to give them the spirit of the word the life of the word i watch so many people try to restore others to truth with just the word like the bible says this is what you should do or this is what you shouldn't do or brother branham said this brother brandon said not shouldn't do that and then they leave it it's like they don't have time to help they only got time to judge and that's what i say it is if only you got time is to give me the word but you ain't got time for anything else you're not strengthening you're not strengthening when we're converted we strengthen we see it through we're family if you don't use the spirit of the word it will often end up confrontational offensive confusing lord fill us with the holy ghost remember when jesus sent some of his disciples to a certain village as a samaritan village it was for a short stay and the village actually rejected jesus because he was just going to stay there a little bit he was passed on through to go to jerusalem you know all those samaritans didn't want anything to do with the jews so they got a little attitude toward them and the disciples wanted to judge them because they rejected the truth are you with me let's pick it up in luke chapter 9 verse 54 and when his disciples james and john saw this they said lord will thou we command fire to come down from heaven and consume them even as it's written in the bible i've got word on this one now look at their motive this is what's important with this you have to look at their motive their motive was to destroy them and sometimes we want to destroy everything in our path that don't listen to us that doesn't go what we think we should do and they even used the word they gave word it's like they came to jesus and found them uh found this caught in adultery and the word says we should stone them well the word elijah elias did us should we just do it just just we'll do it what inspiration that inspiration was of the devil that inspiration to judge was of the devil and he says you don't know what spirit you're off you're blinded by the spirit that's on you even though you're elected even though you're in the message of the hour and you're following the prophet you're so close to jesus he hand-picked you but you still didn't have the right spirit amen wrong spirits can get us any time that's why you need to stay humble now if peter would have said lord should we should we just have a word of prayer for them before we leave i think jesus would have said that's the right spirit right you know the right spirit amen we're not getting about a disciple and convert everybody but i'll tell you what i'd rather die trying to wash somebody's feet have them pick me out of the way with their feet then not even try i don't want to be going up on the other side and the lord asked me who did you disciple discipline isn't preaching right that's right discipline isn't telling somebody the word it's taking the living word and manifested we are written epistles right of all men it's our life we're we're written with the spirit of the living god by this shall all men know when that love is manifested amen i like what jesus said here in verse 56 for the son of man has not come to destroy men's life but to save them and they went to another village so after rebuking his disciples after telling them like it was he also let them know what the real motive is jesus we could say was on the converted side he wasn't converted he was the eternal life standing in front of them he didn't he did he was there where he was calling his disciples to come after they were converted amen amen and we are called to save lives to help to strengthen to better not to tell we don't need tellers we need helpers amen strengtheners to bring me closer to bring my walk closer to god i'm so glad that the lord spoke to me through a prophet when he said i'd rather have the wrong doctrine not even have the right truth but have the correct spirit think about that we all want to be so right true true true truth well you can have the truth and have a wrong spirit and eventually eventually that spirit is going to lead you away from the truth yes but you can actually be wrong the way that you see something if your spirit is righteous that spirit will lead and guide you into all truth the emphasis in discipline is the spirit that you're projecting the spirit of the word not the this we've got we're going to call down some fire right now if you don't straighten up i've had it with you you don't reject the truth they've obviously they're in this spot where they're rejecting the truth whether they know it or not there's this shouldn't be any light bulb on where we need the light bulb is how do i help them you don't know what to do spend some time with jesus lord give me the right spirit not the words to say the words to live the words to live the spirit to live amen you know we won't be able to do very good for one another if we can't disciple one another it's a body ministry we're supposed to edify one another i think too often our personal discipline we forget what the real motive is when we're trying to disciple somebody it's not about getting others to straighten up to follow us proving that others are wrong certainly not about judging others or trying to destroy their reputation or their influence we need to keep our motive peers our goal ought to be to reach and restore remember when they're in need you've got to reach them first remember brother man i'm talking about if you're trying to run somebody to christ you start out talking about what the the natural things that they like to reach them make the bridge with them well they don't like me brother john don't give me an excuse because he doesn't he won't allow you to have one excuse amen well i i'm not i'm not a deacon it doesn't matter your title it matters your relationship amen it doesn't matter your knowledge it matters are you converted enough to strengthen somebody to take them from where they're at to where they need to be this is to me to me this service puts a huge responsibility on all of us this is not some learn some scriptures and tell them no let's learn to live some scriptures all right so in disciple 101 always remember your words don't possess the power to reveal anything only god can reveal himself not us how many times you tried to speak something you gave him the word this is the word this is what the word is this is what jesus said this was the prophet said this is this is the truth and they said so what our words don't possess the power to reveal anything it has to be god's word amen and you could be speaking god's word but not his spirit you're not even given an opportunity for god to reveal amen you need the spirit behind the word when we're speaking biblical truth it doesn't mean that revelation is going into somebody's heart matthew chapter 11 verse 25 at that time jesus answered and said i thank thee father lord of heaven and of earth because thou has hid these things from the wise and the prudent and has revealed them unto babes even so father for it seemed the right thing in your eyes it's good in your sight all things jesus said are delivered unto me of my father he gave them to me all powers mine and no man knows me but the father neither knoweth any man the father save the son and he to whomsoever the son will reveal him we can't figure out god you can't teach god you can't disciple anybody on your own accord you need to be converted you need the holy ghost you need the nature of god doing the discipline amen and so when you realize this just basics discipline 101 when you're going to speak to somebody the word of god and you're going to try to disciple them remember you cannot give them revelation it is impossible jesus said upon this rock i'll build my church it's what comes from heaven upon us amen so all we're doing is going there in the spirit of the word and bring the life of the word so they see the life amen that's good and that's what restores them amen it's the life of the word and you can possess that the manifestation we don't need a bunch of robots that quote the word right we're way beyond that amen we're looking for lifers amen that's right so if the father had hid the truth from the from the proud the wise and the prudent so as the son if you really want the truth it's going to require a humble and contrite spirit yes and if you want to give the truth to somebody you're going to have to have that spirit behind you if that person's got a chance people get turned off by an arrogant spirit proud know it all boastful i can prove you're wrong it's the divine love of god that's right that's gonna catch somebody it's got to be the motive the motive has to be the divine love of god to help to strengthen remember jesus talking to peter if you love me feed my sheep if you let me feed my sheep it was like that last message just kind of what he was saying in the scriptures strengthen your brother when you get converted bring people from where they're at to where god is calling them to amen well i don't know where god's calling them to then why are you judging them right seems like you have a you have enough knowledge to judge him but you don't have enough holy ghost to do anything about it all right we see our brothers and sisters there's a need there's some fault some character flaw they've been in the message a long time or they're a new believer it doesn't matter we see them in this condition what do we do brother john all right galatians chapter six verse 1. brethren if i man be overtaken in a fault ye which are spiritual restore such a one in the spirit of meekness considering thyself less thou also be tempted overtaken in a fault well if we're being honest we could we everybody's got faults everybody's got character flaws everyone's got a part of their behavior their character that just isn't christ-like so we need to help one another and we got to be spiritual about it ye which are spiritual i want to talk a little bit about this but don't look at this as an office of achievement ye which are spiritual like it's an office of achievement but it's as someone that's soberly walking in the spirit god's in control god's nature is in control most believers view themselves as being spiritual regardless of how they act or how they handle things believers are called to be seated together in heavenly places but don't be surprised if you see the enemy there because the bible says that there's spiritual wickedness in high places too god prepares a table for us in the presence of our enemies so we understand there's a spiritual battle going up so being spiritual needs to be defined correctly i'll say the core of spiritual wickedness is the knowledge of truth without the spirit of truth that to me is the core of spiritual wickedness people who know but do not have the life of this word behind it this type of spirituality spirituality has the ability to manipulate with that knowledge of truth think about all the times the devil comes and he he knows our our what we did wrong and he just goes like this he manipulates us you you no good you shouldn't have done that you're not a christian you don't you don't you yeah that's right that's what he does with the knowledge of the truth but he doesn't have the life of the word and so we too can we can be so spiritual that we have power to make someone feel condemned when they're wrong or make somebody feel justified when they're wrong oh it's okay it doesn't matter if you do that right either way you're missing the life of the word right but this spirituality is lacking the love and character of christ to help somebody because in either situation we're called to help them whether they're whether if they've done something so horrible so bad that they shouldn't have done that because you know he's been in the message for you know five years he should know better it doesn't matter it doesn't matter you do not have any right from god to condemn somebody or to say it's okay but you have been called of god to go strengthen them our goal and our motive is to restore such a one it cannot it cannot be to prove the wrong or the right and notice the scripture we don't restore them with the letter of the word the bible says restore such a one in the spirit of meekness wow we forget that we forget that little part and we're trying to straighten things up without the right spirit we give no offense to the ministry you're going with a message you're going to you're going to disciple somebody you've got a ministry minister of reconciliation you don't offend them you don't bring offense to that situation you're there with a motive to help strengthen them out of the situation we restore with the spirit of the word which is meekness jesus said learn of me i'm meek i'm meek i'm lonely when he chose moses to take the children of israel he had to first knock out all the old nature and you know it took 40 years it wasn't once or twice coming up the altar and crying no it took some real beating amen but he became the meekest man on earth the bible says you restore with the right spirit i can't emphasize this enough this is the word this is not me we don't put any thought about the right spirit when we go to somebody you know a lot of times people i've heard people have come to me they can't go to soul inside because they're afraid they're going to get upset in other words they're telling me they themselves will get upset they're telling me they don't possess enough meekness and i'm okay if you identify what the problem is it's kind of hard to help somebody if you're not helping yourself first that and it just turns into judging one another the bible says in our opening scripture for the kingdom of god is not meat and drink but righteousness and peace and joy in the holy oath not doctrines not do's and don'ts people get choked on that but the life of the word that's what will bring about obedience to the word all right why did god what did god do with the character of moses why didn't he just use somebody with a strong muscular because that's not who he is that's not who god is jesus said learn of me learn of me i'm meek and lowly learn because that's how you need to become that's right right you need to become just like jesus you still handle problems still strengthen your brethren yes you just do it his way you disciple his way amen turn with me if you would to matthew chapter seven most people when they go to disciple they don't consider themselves their eyes are so glued on how wrong the other person is they don't consider themselves true they don't they don't last thou also be tempted considering himself lest thou also be tempted what are we tempted to do judge judge that's what we're tempted to do jesus said in matthew chapter 7 verse 3 and why beholdest thou the mouth that is in thy brother's eye but consider not to be missing on eye why aren't you considering your own self like who in here honestly who do you know in your life who do you know and hear and in all the most perfect people that you know tell me one person that doesn't got a problem in their life this scripture that jesus is talking about is not just for real bad people or trying to judge other people this scripture is for me it's for you we need to consider before we go to somebody and try to help them with their problem or tell them about their problem a motive needs to be to help not straighten them out and but i'll just i just want to answer that question for jesus but consider not the being that is unknown why he said why because their motive is to judge they're wrong their motive isn't to help that's what we do that's why we consider ourselves amen i'm just as much as sinners there that's right amen i need just as much help as they do so now my motive is to help them that's what i want helping me or how will thou say to thy brother let me pull out the mold out of thine eye and behold a beam is in your own eye it's because people do not consider their own character flaws they stare at other people and you do that long enough you'll judge them that's why jesus said in matthew 7 verse 2 for with what judgment you judge you're going to be judged and with what measure ye might you ye it shall be measured to you again now jesus identifies this person in verse 5 as a hypocrite i don't care how religious he is i don't care how much he knows he's a hypocrite thou hypocrite first cast out the beam out of thine own eye and then thou shall see clearly to cast the mote out of thy brother's eye it takes love to help somebody it takes humility you have to humble yourself before god and say god i'm sorry now you have to go with the spirit that same spirit and help this person get to a place yes and it takes the spirit of christ the spirit of meekness the nature of god doing it see us doing it it's just going to be all vanity it's not going to amount to much we may win we may not win but the way god does it it always works amen so consider thyself don't judge consider thyself so when you feel you've been put on a mission by god to go disciple somebody take the spirit of the word and not the letter of the word only for the letter killeth but the spirit is going to give them life second corinthians chapter 3 verse 6 says who also have made you and i us all of us able ministers of the new testament not of the letter now not just quoting the wrong but the spirit yes for the letter kilo but the spirit giveth life i'm so glad jesus hung and died for me it was the spirit of the word he was the word but it was that spirit of giving that we could have life and if if that same spirit lives on us we want to give life to others not tell them they're wrong but give life provide a way of escape wash their feet help them pray through get together with him do what you got to do not just say things it takes the right spirit to restore somebody the wrong spirit will do more damage than ever help somebody the wrong spirit offends people don't say don't say this i've heard this well i didn't offend him it was the word that's a wrong spirit how do you know it wasn't the way you presented the word it most likely was without the spirit of meekness all right turn with me to james chapter 3 verse 13. we can't witness properly with just with our own wisdom we need god's wisdom the bible says who is a wise man and endued with knowledge among you all right who wants to stand up because i before you stand up i'm going to call you out and you know i'll do it so who is a wise man and do with knowledge among you let him show out of a good conversation his works with what meekness of wisdom not some first timothy chapter 1 meekness of wisdom this wise man isn't just using words he's using the spirit of meekness and the fruit of the spirit is love joy peace our brother jonathan in our men's meeting today he said i believe that in all of our teachings with our our children parenting spouses should always be associated with the fruits of the spirit and i believe if god's there the fruit all be there all right verse 14 but if you have bitter envying and strife in your heart against somebody don't glory don't act like you're right they're wrong you're lying against the truth this wisdom descendeth not from above it's concocted by the devil it's earthly it's central it's devilish for where there's envy and strife there's confusion and every evil work that's right how are you going to disciple somebody in an argument in a debate it's just going to create a strife an envy a confusion this this is not from above that's not this is i don't care how wise you think you are that's not a wise man let's look what we really need to witness or disciple somebody here in verse 17. just remember this is discipline 101 it's not very deep but the wisdom that is from above is it's first pure the mode of is love it's pure i just want to help i just want to strengthen uh it's pure there's nothing mixed with it you can't be showing anybody that you know more that you got more that it's about you and building you it has nothing to do with you it's about strengthening your brethren amen it's a different subject than your flesh wants because when it's you doing it that's where you're going to do all this strife and envy and debate and stuff but when it's god that nature change inside of you well then it's going to be first it's going to be pure love and then look then it's peaceable there isn't any of that and it's gentle gentle easy to be entreated not harsh it's not rude and look it's full of mercy you ever get something out of the fridge some milk or something and you pick it up there's hardly nothing in there sometimes that's what some people have with mercy they just hardly have anything in there right amen amen the wisdom of god is full of mercy it feels heavy it's got what it takes to get the job done and good fruits without respect to persons without partiality and without hypocrisy and the fruit of righteousness is sown in peace of them that make peace praise the lord let's go back to galatians you got just a little bit of time with me are you getting a little bit out of this all right you getting a lot of this yeah i'm glad that the little was a little quieter all right i want to start here with galatians chapter 6 verse 1 brethren if a man be overtaking the fall ye which are spiritual restore such a one in the spirit of meekness considering myself let's not also be tempted so our true motive is love right bear one another's burden and so fulfill the law of christ see you may be on a mission to go correct somebody because it's annoying you like our kids annoy us but if you're truly discipling then you're on his mission and that mission is to bear one another's burden you bear it you bear it i sent a package down to aaron and elizabeth with all the presents and i'll tell you it was one box in this box was hard to bear because it was heavy it wasn't like this oh i can bear that it was a heavy burden so when you look at somebody they got such annoying need character fall a flaw i want you to carry it you walk around with that that's good too often i ain't carrying it you get rid of it it's annoying me and you think you're disciplining somebody amen we're having to hit the basics right it's not 101. you're still in the prerequisites the true law is not to judge with god's word but to help carry their fault to calvary because they may think it's okay to have it they may be walking around this today this is just me i'm still a christian i swear i've always been swayed my mom my dad and they carry that with them they don't even might not even know it's a it's a problem so you really got to go with meekness you just can't go bless them with the word if you're a believer the word says this you ain't doing it you ain't a christian no you have to carry that come on brother just give me some time sister i just want to show you what god's done for me amen you carry it you burden in prayer and it means it means much to you to get this off of your brother get it off as if it was on you yes amen amen and this is how you fulfill the law of christ amen too often believers think they fulfill their duty when they just tell somebody what to do but it's not true it's not at all true we got to see them through to a strengthened a a right position you've taken from the position that they're at strengthening means you take them to a right position this just discipline thing it takes a lot and i think that's why we shy away from it but i'll tell you you get converted you'll carry that burden because christ is in you and christ cares about that person even if you don't come on bear one another's burden is actually helping them this box was so heavy you don't know many times i'd have thought of where someone was here to help me you bearing is helping not telling somebody they're wrong that just getting some negative thing that's been bothering you off your chest don't report their wrongs like some newspaper or podcast is they getting the information out there let's go help them if a man think himself to be something when he is nothing he deceiveth himself verse 3 a man that thinks he's something is a man who's got all the answers oh yeah that that they just need to i don't know they got a word for everything he knows so much but yet he can't do anything to help that's a person who thinks himself he's something when he's really not it ain't what you know it's what you possess silver and gold have i none but such as i have i give i in thee god is calling us to a much higher level we should never be talking about one another's problems we should be witnessing and seeing one another lay down their lives for one another that's what should be happening to a mature church that's what should be happening if we go ahead and we just think all we gotta do is tell somebody the bible says we're deceived he deceiveth himself but let every man prove his work and then shall he have rejoicing in himself alone and not another for every man shall bear his own burden so we start by learning to bear own burdens start learning to take your problems and your issues to the cross yes yes that if the power of god can help you in your life that's it then that same power yes amen can work through you to help somebody else go to calgary so you bear your burden first then you go and you bear one another's burden amen the problem is people never get to a place where they get enough nature change to where they're actually living for others some having compassion making a difference that's what it takes to bear one another's burden it takes compassion it'll make a difference let's stand together god bless you be compassionate remain humble so if i asked you a question today are you converted it's a sobering question and of course the go-to answer is yes but i just gave you the go-to answer the fruit of the answer is strengthening one another so as a pastor i'm looking to you to strengthen one another that's what a body ministry does if your ear itches you don't tell your toe to scratch it your body works together your thought oh i got to do something that's itching you your muscles start moving it starts going in that direction and you give relief the brain just doesn't do it we're a body ministry the the preaching goes forth from here yes the teaching goes forward from here but now you take the word you take the word and you start activating it and look i'd like to see you try and fail get up and try again but don't take this message today and just let it go by the side amen put it into use because as our church grows we really need the maturity of discipline properly we're going to offend people we're going to hurt people and we we need the spirit of the word amen amen let's sing i love him we don't got no music
