possible only believe lord i believe lord i believe all things are possible lord i believe lord i believe lord i believe all things are possible lord i believe lord i receive he's here to give it to you lord i received all things are possible lord i received lord i received lord i received all things are possible lord i received amen amen that is something worth shouting about amen it's receiving from the lord it's the only thing that we can take with us amen god bless you may be seated just for a moment we wanted to show a little bit uh uh some pictures um from africa from brother daniel and as she's getting that ready i wanted to re let you know that there is an annual report of what um olysma has done in central america and that's back out on the bulletin board there for everybody to see in one place the lord wanted us to not let the left hand know what the right hand is doing but i think it's important for everyone to see where their money's going what it's being used for and i want to give you the opportunity for a couple services and we'll probably just tuck that away but god bless you for giving we'll never know till we get to the other side just the effect of our sacrifices made that's right it is it is something to look forward to amen everybody remembers brother daniel darko man such a precious brother all right now this is at this is brother um don't change this this is brother uh wisdom's church and this is him that's brother daniel this is brother daniel's church there's a few that have received bibles in his own church and brother daniel's been very instrumental in handing out a lot of bibles and uh but he's he he just doesn't give him out randomly he he he prays about his heart he protects them takes care of them this is um d z o d z e that's that's what this place is and they're receiving uh um a second supply so this must be uh the others that have have come in that um have not received them yet all right um this is i believe part of brother james's church let's keep going this is the uh we the church has sent down money to purchase this land to build a church for for brother james it's about six and a half hours away from brother daniel's church and he it's good to see him you know reaching out to help other brothers build so praise the lord for the work that he's doing amen praise the lord thank you jesus you know this the work of the lord could not be done unless there were hearts out there that had the heart of god to want to reach out for others we we cannot do it ourselves we're not in touch with these people right you know we can only touch those that are near us so in order for the kingdom to work properly we've we've got to be in touch with those that are working in other areas to help support them so we're grateful our brother's been a very faithful brother with the money that he's he's received over the years and uh we're just we pray for him i want you to pray for him um his heart is to to work for the lord even though we don't see these brothers we don't hear from them on a daily basis pray for them on a daily basis amen well god bless you let's stand together for the opening scripture here we're going to read in galatians chapter 5 verse 16. for opening scripture before we read this let's look to the the author amen i wonder if anyone here today has something in their heart they really desire god to help them with amen let's just keep that before the lord as we we go to him in prayer father we bow our heads before you towards the dust from which we came you breathed in your nostrils lord and you created man and lord one day we'll have to return there these bodies but lord there is a seed that came from you also and that seed is returned back to you lord we ask that you would forgive us of our trespasses that we've trespassed in in this body in our spirits and lord our unbelief we're not worthy to look upon the book lord we thank you for paying the ultimate price that we could stand here loving your word appreciating your word honoring your word lifting it up lord as much as you love thy word it's forever settled in heaven it's never going to change and lord we're standing here with this word believing the same lord now you saw the the hands that were lifted the hearts that had a need and there's no one sermon that can as it were be custom tailored to to speak to such a variety of different needs we would have lord i do believe that your word can minister to each and every need i pray that lord as they've lifted their hands and requested lord would you look down and meet this need help me with this need lord that at this present moment that you'd give them faith to believe that it will happen to the ministry of the word remove all doubts and questions lord help us to get out of the flesh and to enter into the spirit of the word at this time lord that we might see you in your proper position high above our problems and our circumstances high above our situations lord lift us up into heavenly places this morning to sit with you lord for you thou art more than able to meet every need according thy riches in glory we thank you for these things and ask your blessings now and the remainder of this service draw us closer to you and we give you the praise and honor for all these things in jesus precious name amen god bless you may be seated oh did we we didn't read the scripture yet i'm so sorry galatians chapter 5 verse 16 this i say then walk in the spirit and you shall not fulfill the lust of the flesh amen god bless you may be seated we want to we'll be doing a little mini series on walking with god and this morning we want to entitle this choosing to walk in the spirit amen and this could seem like a strange title because who would not choose to walk in the spirit right we would all choose to walk in the spirit but it's not that easy amen because our flesh hates the spirit and it will do everything it can to keep from doing what the spirit wants us to do amen the next verse says for the flesh lusteth against the spirit and the spirit against the flesh that these are contrary to one another so that ye cannot do the things that you would amen do you ever meet somebody that was a little bit contrary to you you're a little bit contrary to them well this is the way our flesh is and the spirit is and in inside of us is both that's right and so there's a constant war going on and brother branham taught us it's like the greatest battle ever being fought paul referred to it in romans chapter 7 verse 19 for the good that i would do i do not amen but the evil which i would not do that i do the intentions are there to do the right thing but there's no power in which to do it to walk in the spirit and to fulfill the good intentions verse 18 for i know that in me that is my flesh dwell with no good thing for to will is present with me i want to do good the will to do it is with me but how to perform that which is good i can't find it see it's not easy amen but yet a hard choice has to be made verse 16 of romans chapter 6 romans chapter 6 verse 16 know ye not that to whom you yield yourselves servants to obey his servant you are whether whom you obey whether of sin unto death or of on obedience unto righteousness so there's a part that we play here you know we're not robots right we have a choice in who we're going to yield to but god be thank that we are not the servants of sin but ye have obeyed from the heart that form of doctrine which was delivered unto you now here it is you come to church and you are delivered a form of doctrine you come to find out how to live it's a doctrine it's what we believe and it's your choice obey it [Music] being then made free from sin if you obey it then being made free from sin you become the servants of righteousness now i speak after the manner of men because of the infirmity of your flesh for as ye have yielded your member servants to uncleanness and to iniquity unto iniquity even so now yield your members servants to righteousness unto holiness isn't this beautiful i mean the bible just calls me out it just calls me out but yet it points me in a direction in which to walk it's one thing to walk with the letter of the word and it's another thing to walk with the spirit of the word it's one thing to walk with the living spirit and it's another to walk with the dead letter of the word now we're all walking with one of the two it's still the word but it's not alive to you if you're just walking with a dead letter it's still the word it's still the bible but it's not alive to you it's still the truth of god but it isn't quickening you at the moment now we're talking about a walking in the spirit is something 24 7. when it comes to walking with god it's easier to walk in the form of the letter than it is to walk in the life of the spirit of the word right amen the devils believe christ they know it they know the letter they know the form but the word isn't quick unto them amen see one is dead and the other is alive and i want to separate that today because we have the the the the false sense of the false comfort because we believe the word intellectually that we're walking with god and that's not the truth amen it's the furthest from the truth they're not the same they can be and they should be the same but they are not the same paul said the letter killeth but the spirit giveth life and times we can be walking with the letter of the word and really not the spirit of the word one can bring a negativity to a situation while the other brings forth a positivity one can be without the bearings of the compass in other words you got a compass but the bearings isn't working right it's a compass it's it's the word how many people went to college or what's a seminar studying the word and they're further away from god because they didn't have the compass of the word they didn't have the bearings of the compass but the spirit always is showing true north amen the spirit of the word is always showing true north america one has the form of godliness while the other has the power of the gospel one is usually searching for an answer in a present problem while the other has the answer because there's a difference between a dead letter and a spirit of the living god amen second corinthians chapter three verse two second corinthians chapter three verse two ye are our epistles written in our hearts known and read of all men not just some all men for as much as ye are manifestly declared to be the epistles of christ ministered by us written not with ink but with the spirit of the living god not in tables of stone but in fleshly tables of the heart this is alive it's alive amen when it's written in your heart it's alive amen when it's written in your brain it's dead right amen it's like uh doesn't every computer have like two different storage units one is a ram and the other is hard drive one is you where you put all the information and just store there and the other is what you're actively using right see the knowledge of the word in not in use is just stored he said i'll the spirit when he comes he'll bring all things to your remembrance he'll get it out there in the front to use it amen verse 4 and such trust have we through christ to godward not that we are sufficient of ourselves to think anything as of ourselves but our sufficiency is of god amen who also have made us you and i able ministers of the new testament that's right look not of the letter not the knowledge but of the spirit for the letter killeth but the spirit giveth life and this is why you can't just come and bring somebody the word in your carnal flesh you'll kill it it's the spirit of the word that brings life notice god has not called us to be ministers of the letter of the word now this is important because we always say word word word word word word what's the bible say and we we need that we need the word we need the bible but if we don't take the spirit of that bible that spirit of that word we're going to miss it we're going to bring more destruction than we'll ever help anybody amen amen so he's made us able ministers with the spirit of the word not a dead letter amen we've been called to bring forth life but we have to choose to walk in the spirit to do that we just can't say this is what the bible says that's right it's not easy for any of us it's not natural it doesn't happen automatically when we wake up in the morning or we run into difficult situations it doesn't happen just because we say we're a believer or we're in the message or we're listening to a tape we're not automatically in the spirit doing those things you have to consciously make the decision i'm going to walk in the spirit always remember you'll never be able to do that unless you first deny yourself now this is the first step that we need to take if we're going to walk in the spirit jesus shared it with us in luke chapter 9 verse 23 you all know the scripture and he said to them all he didn't just say to his favorites he said it to them all if any man will come after me let him deny himself take up his cross daily and follow me this is the john martin version of what you just read if anyone is going to truly follow jesus on a daily basis they first must make the choice to deny their will for the day take of the lord's will which is the cross of suffering amen to do god's will is going to hurt the flesh and then and only then can you follow jesus because that's what he said in that verse up your cross study and follow me he didn't say follow me do this he says if you're going to you got to do this and then follow me the choice may seem easy to make but when it comes right down to it count the cost it's very hard very hard i'd rather just listen to a message just read the bible i just rather sit and and fellowship i just you know but that has nothing to do walk in the spirit friends this is nothing to do about choosing to walk in the spirit if you walked into a seminary and they're just classes full of teachings of the bible and be talking about god left and right but where would the spirit of god be but we can have our own seminaries going in our mind putting the emphasis on the word and not the spirit of the word the letter alone is not going to help us in fact it is what the devil uses against you when you don't follow it to bring the condemnation he doesn't use the spirit of life there are times that we think that we made a conscious choice that day to walk in the spirit but then we end up questioning with everything that happened did i really it can be even confusing a common example oftentimes we can feel that we're walking with god just because we're willing to defend the word this is what the word says but are we defending the word are we just defending our belief in the word it's two different things more wars have been fought over religion than any other reason people are willing to physically fight for their belief but they don't want to fight spiritually he told peter to lay down your sword you mean i just got to be a lamb right now all this stuff's happening at me yes so what happens when somebody comes and they want to knife you and talk about you and be mean to you be a lamb live that word yes live that word amen maybe you know we can say that maybe they don't know how to spiritually fight but maybe they don't want to take the training of the holy ghost maybe they don't want to hear lay down your life like a lamb maybe they're too lazy to die out to their flesh and choose rather to walk or not walk in the spirit but walk in the flesh it's easier you don't have to do nothing to walk in the flesh all you gotta do is get up do your thing get up and do your thing people are willing to fight for what they believe but are they willing to die out to their flesh we can find ourselves fighting many wars over what we believe even with our families and our friends our brothers and our sisters and if we're not careful we too can hurt the ones that we love the most galatians 5 15 says but if you bite and devour one another take heed that you be not consumed one another amen usually when you when you do something amen i mean if i'm gonna if i'm truly going to step on brother mark's tolls he's going to think about that for months down the road not his choice but the devil is going to keep bringing it to his mind you remember what brother john said amen that's just the way the devil is so easy to be consumed one of another too many of us want to prove that we're right rather than to be obeying suffering suffering is a word you have to obey you know everybody suffers but they don't suffer willingly there's a difference suffering for christ is willingly suffering for the devil is unwillingly first peter chapter 2 verse 20 for what glory is it will be buffeted for your faults and you shall take it patiently but if when you do well and suffer for it take it patiently this is acceptable with god your intention's right you do the right thing but somebody wants to judge you negative for it yes sir are you going to stand up and try to prove you're right are you going to take it patiently because if you take a patient that's what's acceptable with god that's the nature of god for even here too were you called because christ also suffered for us leaving us an example that we should follow his steps what was his steps here who did no sin who did no sin neither was guile found in his mouth who when he was reviled he didn't lash back when he suffered he didn't say well i'm going to show you i'm not going to talk to you anymore but he committed himself to him that judgeth righteously commit the situation to god commit your life to god amen don't try to be god don't try to prove you're right amen this is the example that christ left us that means we have a choice to walk in the spirit which is don't fight back we think the spirit is i'm going to show them i'm going to prove it by the word and get the quote out i'm going to amen that's what we think the spirit is the spirit of christ was at calvary laying down his life for us the majority of the time the only way people are going to see christ is when you lay down your life for them and you wash their feet and you show them that you love them beyond having to prove that you're right ii corinthians chapter 10 verse 3 for though we walk in the flesh we do not war after the flesh at times we find ourselves proving our belief rather than defending our belief i want to talk about defending what you believe right because we got to defend what we believe we gotta we gotta take a stand for what we believe you don't defend your belief by proving you're right all the time we've just got to get that off the table get it off the table amen you defend your belief by living by demonstrating and by manifesting the spirit of the word amen that's how you do it amen that ain't easy you got to die out to the flesh the flesh can't be involved verse 4 for the weapons of our warfare are not carnal but mighty through god to the pulling down of strongholds casting down imaginations and every high thing that exalteth itself against the knowledge of god and bringing into captivity every thought to obedience to you becoming obedient to what you need to do in the middle of your battle when you're in the battle what's really important is your obedience not proving your right obedient to what the spirit is leading you to do amen and having a readiness to revenge all disobedience when your obedience is fulfilled right obviously if somebody's lashing out against you there's disobedience right there you want to revenge that your flesh wants to rise up and and put it in its place but the spirit walking in the spirit says you become obedient and you'll put that thing it's a soft answer that turns away wrath it's laying down your life that's going to make a difference that people are going to see you manifestly declaring the life of christ in that situation we just need to fulfill our obedience to the word and not defend our belief right amen live our belief second corinthians chapter six verse three second corinthians chapter six verse three giving no offense in anything that the ministry be not blamed you do not defend the word with offense god has called us to the defense of the gospel not the offense your offense goes by you laying down your life for others that's right be a missionary go out wash somebody's feet give them the good news but when it comes to to dealing with problems you don't go on the offense put the person in their place god doesn't do anything through manipulation everything has to go through free more agency so how in the world is god going to accept you trying to manipulate somebody manipulate somebody to believe your way of thinking he's not going to honor that but in all things approving ourselves now you have a chance to prove yourself right here isn't this cool that you can prove yourself as the ministers of god how you gonna do it in much patience in affliction you're gonna prove it in necessities you're gonna prove it in distress this is how you prove it you prove it in stripes imprisonments and turmoils in labors and watches in fascists this is how you prove it not by you bullying your way putting somebody in their place we demonstrate our ministry and all these situations and all the problems in our life but how do we do it by pureness by knowledge by long-suffering by kindness by choosing to walk in the holy ghost amen by love right on vain amen in other words it's truly and genuinely the pure love of god right amen amen by the word of truth by the power of god by the arm of righteousness on the right hand and on the left right so you prove your ministry with problem situations yes and you do it by the pureness and the power of the holy spirit walking in the spirit much different than how we take care of problems and that's what i'm trying to say a lot of times we think we're walking in the spirit because we're defending the word but frankly we don't even know how to defend the word amen this bible shows us how to stand for the word amen how to demonstrate the spirit of the word that lives inside of you amen anybody can judge you know who's the greatest judge is the devil he was so bold to even judge god that he was wrong he's the accuser of the brethren he knows how to judge he tells me all my faults amen brings them to my memory amen even things that are under the blood he's the judge of judges and he tries to get us to have the same spirit of judging others putting others in their place and when we do that we must realize that we haven't chose to walk in the spirit amen it's one thing to stand for the word it's other things to stand for the spirit of the word let's take a look at ephesians chapter 4 verse 15 but speak the truth in love speak the truth in love may grow up into him in all things which is that even christ most people speak the truth without the spirit of truth yes sir most people speak the truth without the spirit of truth and you don't have the spirit of truth you don't have you're not going to speak the truth in love you're just going to speak the truth and you're going to stand there like those that caught that woman in adultery and say isn't this what the what the word says am i telling you the word and then what moses said is it what the prophet william branham said why is it why is it that they want to speak the word without the spirit of the word because the spirit that's on them wants to manipulate the situation to prove something to prove a point to dominate to esteem themselves better looking for vain glory there could be a number of fleshly colonel reasons but when you speak the truth with the spirit of truth you will always be speaking in love because even jesus said as many as i love i rebuke now chasten he wants to turn us around he may tell us we're heading straight to hell and it may not be a good feeling but at least he tells us where the door's at and our conversation is always supposed to be with grace right not judgment grace coupled with fear always showing a way of escape that's speaking the truth in love amen we don't want to hold back the truth but we just want to speak it in love amen another supporting scripture we can find here in second thessalonians chapter 2 verse 7. ii thessalonians chapter 2 verse 7 for the mystery of iniquity doth already work only he who now letteth will let until he be taken out of the way and then shall the wicked be revealed whom the lord will shall consume with the spirit of his mouth and shall destroy with the brightness of his coming notice how the wicked is going to be destroyed the spirit of his mouth and of course it's the word of god but the point that i'm trying to say is we don't want the form of the word we want the life of the word amen amen even him who's coming is after the working of satan with all powers and signs and lying wonders now notice satan this this person is coming after the working of satan so this is in other words he mimics satan we know this is the antichrist he's got power he's got signs he's got line wonders but our theme here is the mystery of iniquity verse 10 and also with all deceivableness of unrighteousness in them that perish because they receive not the love of the truth that they might be saved i'm going to tell you what's really important when we come to church is to honestly love the word that's being preached because if we don't love the word bad things happen for this cause god shall send them strong delusions that they should believe a lie that they all might be damned who believe not the truth but had pleasure and unrighteousness there are people that may have received the knowledge of the word but not the spirit of the word so the devil's believe that they don't have a love for the truth at the same time that they believe they also hold iniquity i want to talk just a few minutes about the mystery of iniquity because to be honest friends we all have iniquity in our lives we're sitting here we're standing here we all have iniquity in our lives now by the grace of god i trust that you've asked the blood of jesus christ to cleanse you before under his sanctuary but the thing is it don't take long before iniquity sets back in i want to talk to you about the mystery there's a mystery with iniquity iniquity will keep us from walking intimately with god amen if we're going to choose daily to walk in the spirit we're going to need to pray to pray that iniquity would not be in us and to pay special attention to this mystery that works inside of us iniquity was first found in lucifer ezekiel chapter 28 verse 15 says thou was perfect in thy ways from the day that that was created till iniquity was found in thee iniquity came after iniquity set in when choice was given i have a i planted trees i plant all sorts of trees plants you've all been planters anything that you planted it's still if it's alive it's still the same thing that you planted and i planted a lot of evergreens i play a lot of plants and every time i go there i can have an expectation those are willows those willows are still there they're still dropping their branches they don't change but free more agency has a chance to change lucifer knew to keep god first in his life but he decided in his heart to do his own will instead so he did he wanted to do his own will instead of god's lucifer was created to do god's will in fact all things were created for him by him for him to bring him pleasure honor glory everything that is that we see was created for god not just by god to do whatever they wanted to do amen for god and to bring him glory he said i will ascend i will exalt my will above god's will for my life it's the same thing that the spirit of the devil taught eve to do to the most subtle beast the tree of knowledge of good and evil it's the knowledge of good but choosing to do your will instead that's the evil that's it just trying to keep it simple what did brother branham teach us that iniquity was knowing the will of god knowing what you should be doing and not doing it evil is simply knowing the right thing and not doing it we're talking about the mystery of iniquity that does already work lucifer had charisma he probably was the pinnacle of charisma with his charisma he was able to get a third of the angels on board with his idea then to get the most subtle beast on board then to get eve on board with his idea and from there satan was able to worm his way into the nature of man and every man that's born is born with the satanic nature of knowing what's right but choosing not to do it and that's why a man must be born again a different nature amen david said in psalms 51 verse 5 behold i was shapen in iniquity in sin did my mother conceive me we go through life shaping take a piece of wood you whittle it down you you're shaping it take a piece of steel whittle it down you're shaping it you take a little child you bring them up in the way you should go right you're shaping them that's right then the catholic church say give me a child so he's five years old and everything will be fine there's something about shaping in the word we need the word we need to be shapen by god our own nature if you just watch this world is going in utter destruction why it's because it's not listening to god it's doing its own thing amen man the bible says that man's gonna end up destroying himself amen he listens to the devil he listens to his own nature he doesn't uh think he needs to do what god tells him to do he's just gonna do his own thing now lucifer didn't stop there iniquity has piled up inside the churches where people are trying to get back to god you'll find iniquity there but satan has convinced them that they can still have god and still do their will this is the mystery of iniquity ezekiel 28 verse 18 thou has defiled thy sanctuaries by the multitude of iniquities and by the iniquity of thy traffic and of course when you think of traffic you're thinking there's a lot of cars right well iniquity is the same thing a lot of iniquity did not jesus say because iniquity would abound in the last days that the love of many would wax cold yes iniquities just simply not robbing banks now right not killing people just not doing what the lord wants you to do doing his will now this is the john martin definition of the mystery of iniquity it is that a person feels safe with having the knowledge of truth without the spirit of truth to obey it i got this truth i got this knowledge and you feel good that you have it and you call it a revelation and you don't even question yourself when you're not manifesting it it's still a revelation it's the mystery of a negative doth already work it's already working we were shaping in it amen just brings that whole thing into the church and said well you know as long as you do this you're okay that's why you can't tell a lot of people things because it the iniquity the spirit of iniquity is so strong in a person's life it's already working in the churches iniquity is inside the people who choose to let it remain it's true right for the mystery does already work only he who now let us will let until he be taken out of the way see we have a choice in the matter we can let it remain or we can get serious about it now you're not responsible for my iniquity and i'm not responsible for yours but we're all on the same path here the same plane i have a choice to make with iniquity in my life and you have a choice with iniquity in your life are you going to let it remain right now because eventually it's going to be taken out of the way he's shaking heaven and earth right amen he yes it's up to us to get serious about walking in the spirit amen amen you're not going to hold iniquity inside and walk in the spirit come on he's calling us to make a choice to walk into spirit that means we have to do something about it the goal of the bride is not to let it not to let iniquity remain in her that's the goal of the bride and she's the only one that will do something with her iniquity she's the only one second timothy chapter 2 verse 19 second timothy chapter 2 verse 19 nevertheless the foundation of god stands sure having this seal the lord knoweth them that are his and let everyone that nameth the name of christ depart from iniquity make a choice to go in a different direction than doing your will amen amen amen don't be satisfied with knowing god's will what god did for you and not care about what not care about doing his will don't be satisfied with doing your will it's iniquity it was at the beginning it is today it is important that we come to grips with the importance yes of doing the will of god for our lives we can't just well i'm going to do this do this this i'm saved everything's okay it won't work friends take a look at matthew chapter 7 i'll show you amen the bride is the only one that's going to depart from her iniquity matthew chapter 7 verse 21 not everyone that sayeth unto me lord lord shown her to the kingdom of heaven but he that doeth the will of my father which is in heaven the will of my father amen amen lucifer was okay in fact he was actually perfect until he decided to do his own will [Music] see the importance here is to do all of god's will and not just part of god's will many will say unto me that day lord lord have we not prophesied thy name and in thy name cast out devils and in thy name done many wonderful works and then why profess unto them you're liars he doesn't say that he doesn't he doesn't challenge them on what they did he doesn't say no you didn't cast out devils he didn't say no you didn't do many wonderful works he's letting us know that's not good enough and then i will profess to them i never knew you depart from me he that work his own will amen he who works his own will it's important friends it's really important now i know the devil has spoken to us just like he did all these people and said well as long as you go to church as long as you pay your tithes as long as you fill in the blank in the message as long as you're okay you can do what you want to do do what you want to do but god's own testimony is that he didn't have a relationship with him because the relationship that he's looking for with the bride is one in which god is the head amen that his bride does his will and not just does a couple rules and regulations to be accepted to go to heaven we're talking about relationship here it's important to do all those things but we've been called to do the will of god when we're born again all things are of god right right his we now it's his will so it's really really important that we want have a love for the truth and the truth is this is the truth on the day of judgment when it's all over the truth is god's will will stand god's will is preeminent god's will is the omnipotent every knee will bell every tongue will confess it is going to end up in god's will between now and then we have a choice to make to walk in the spirit to choose to do god's will amen that's what's important not making it to church and say i did my sunday job it's about getting serious with your life with god amen i want the testimony i don't know who i was talking to about the testimony with enoch enoch had a wonderful testimony he walked with god right amen but noticed he wasn't perfect when he started he had iniquity in his life but you know what he kept doing every time god showed him he kept taking care of it yes he kept walking on a daily basis with god because god's own testimony the by the word of god says he walked with god to walk in the spirit we got to be serious about the iniquity in our life that we all have yes does the bible say that he that coverth we don't want to cover we want to we want to depart from it now i'm not saying you need to tell everybody i don't think you need to tell one person your iniquity in fact i advise you not to do it there's only one person in here that i know that will handle your iniquity properly and that's god amen amen deal with it depart from it because your relationship depends on it with god your relationship depends on it with god jesus said in john chapter 16 verse 13 how be it when the spirit of truth is come he will guide you into all truth in other words he's going to guide you to depart from it from iniquity right amen that's the truth for he shall not speak of himself but whatsoever he shall hear that shall we speak the spirit of truth will guide you into all truth but the spirit of air will lead and guide you into iniquity and it's okay where you feel safe with having the knowledge of the truth without the spirit of truth to obey it a lot of times we enjoy a spirit that comes to us and tells us how great we are how good we are that we're in the message that we're safe that we're secure that we're not as bad as the other person but that's a spirit that's speaking of himself and when the spirit of truth come he won't do that so he's going to talk about god amen amen what we need to become to become more like him i'll tell you i'll say this we don't know we can't even discern the majority of times that the devil is speaking to us but because we're in the message and we're bright we feel so good about it we need to start exercising trying the spirits because it's not we don't make a rapture because we say we're in the message we make a rapture because we go on to perfection amen amen the message is pointing us to perfection amen it's brought us the good news what we need to get ready john chapter 8 verse 28 let's see if we can just find that oh my there's a there's so much here i'm just going to say it took me a half hour to go through you know the pictures at the beginning matthew chapter eight i'm going to start with verse 28. oh that what did i say matthew i did say john i said matthew first we're amen i am in john chapter 8 right now what did i say i am sorry matthew they were disciples and everything but as i'm not reading on matthew right now you know this was weird i i mean i'm as i'm as you know i used a lot of notes because i just i spent a lot of time studying and i'm typing out you know what i'm thinking and i'm saying it i looked down and i did not say those words and i just and it's written you know no spelling errors but i just didn't say the words what is your problem so i can relate to saint matthew when i didn't mean it john chapter 8 verse 28 then said jesus unto them when ye have lifted up the son of man then shall you know that i am he and i do nothing of myself but as my father taught me i speak these things and he's and he that sent me is with me and the father have not left me for i always do those things that are pleasing to him and as he spake these words many many many many many many believed on him and you would have thought that would have been good enough he would have just said good enough that's all you need to do then said jesus to the jews which did to the many many many that believed on him if you continue in my word then are you my disciples indeed amen so this could be continue to do the things that you've been taught continue it also could be continue to grow in those things that you've been taught it also could mean continue as i give you new word to continue in that so there's a lot of continuation that we could be looking at here amen and ye shall know the truth and the truth shall make you free see the the words that are coming forth from the bible they do not make you free the truth that you're hearing with your ears does not make you free you do have to accept it you have to believe it not like the devils believe it but you have to believe it by accepting it and obeying it and when you do the truth shall set you free the knowledge of the word will only condemn you it's got to go beyond that say amen to the accepting of the word say amen to the spirit of the word say amen to i love the truth of the word amen praise god the law's in our court it's up to us whether we're going to follow through with it amen some people are just mystery seekers they want to know the day and the hour hidden things that brother branham said between the lines the things that brother branham wasn't allowed to say the answers to all the mysteries to their questions basically it couldn't be anything that satisfies their discovery channel as long as they don't have to die out they want to hear about it i want to sit down hear a sermon learn new things but if i got to die out about it it is just not my cup of tea i call mystery seekers look what it did for every oh she wanted to she was so interested in being like god but the man said she lusted for knowledge amen even though god didn't want us to know the day or the hour we still want to know the day right now there's a reason god didn't want us to know he he told us the most important thing be ready be ready amen be ready the reason that he said about the the fig tree when you begin to see it you know that summer's night that this generation's not going to pass he gave us a sign that we're near the end but he doesn't want us to know the day or the hour right we want our preacher to stand up here and tell us something we don't know so we can leave here feeling like i've got something that i didn't have on a cape but what god wants is you to be ready amen he wants you to be more in love with him more in love with the word like you want to become the word and that you love him so much you're willing to die out for it amen that's what he's interested in amen that's not what your flesh is interested in and there's the battle that's why we have to choose to walk in the spirit choose it first corinthians chapter 13 verse 1. first corinthians chapter 13 verse 1 though i speak with the tongues of men and of angels and have not charity i become a sounding brass or tinkling symbols and though i have the gift of prophecy and understand all mysteries and all knowledge and though i have all faith so that i can remove mountains and under charity i'm nothing you could understand all the mysteries you can have all the knowledge amen we don't need to be mystery seekers we need to be master pleasers big difference big difference once i want to please my master amen amen the others i want to seek more mysteries so i can know more so i can be puffed up more right but you know it's really love that edifies charity is what edifies amen amen yes and though i bestow all my goods to feed the poor and though i get my body to be burned and and have not charity profit me it sounds like i prophesied your name i did many wonderful works i cast out devils i didn't know you i don't know you there is no relationship they must have been missing a love for the word amen a love for the truth a love to do the things that they're not doing instead of being satisfied with the things that they are doing first corinthians chapter 13 verse 9 dropping down to verse 9 for we know in part we prophesy in part but when that which is perfect is come then that which is in part shall be done away when as a child i spake as a child i understood as a child i thought as a child but when i became a man i put away i put away that thinking of wanting to know and took on the maturity that god wants me to love like him amen amen seek to love god now we're wrapping up it's warm in here i didn't touch the heat but it is like it's like in an oven and i'm okay with it no no brother mike sit down i'm okay with it but i need you to wake up we're almost done this is important first john chapter 3 verse 10 in this the children of god are manifest in the children of the devil whosoever does not righteousness is not a god well that's obvious neither he that loveth not his brother whoa how important is it for this is the message that you have heard from the beginning that you should love one another amen amen not as cain who was of that wicked one and slew his brother wherefore slew him because his own works for evil and his brothers were righteous now this i want to say none of us are probably guilty of actually killing or murdering somebody physically and if we did we did but we're definitely all guilty of wanting to do it we're all guilty of wanting to kill somebody's influence say something negative about somebody behind their back and feel comfortable because you're speaking the truth without the spirit of troops that's right amen that's not a sign of god yes right amen amen the message of the hour is hebrews 13 8. jesus christ is the same yesterday and forever yes that's the message the prophet brought the messenger the hour goes beyond the curtain of time into eternity bring back the report like joshua and caleb and said the land is flowing with milk and honey it's just like god promised it would be that god is love the report is true we we are to love god with all of our heart with all of our soul with all of our might yes that's the report it's a true report and the message is the same as it was from the beginning he said brother sister nothing but perfect love was there and he also went on to say that nothing but perfect love can enter that place he said there's no way to describe it there's there's no words in the dictionary that can actually describe how perfect this love is yes there's no words he says now whatever you do whatever you got going on in your busy life and how important it may seem to you he said lay it all aside until first you do this one thing excuse me brother get perfect love right amen get to a place where you can love everybody without respect to persons even your enemy the emphasis now you can't do that on your own the only way you're about to do that say god fill you with your spirit amen i choose to walk in the spirit amen [Music] now where should we be putting our time well brother john i'm so busy you don't even know my life i'm exempt from this whatever you got going on in your life lay it aside yes until well that's good that's fine but i just i just want to hear some more about mysteries i just want to hear something new i just want i want to feel good when i leave church is that what church is meant to do make you feel good i wish i could just grab this and say isaiah how did you feel when you were in the church with god what that preacher made you to feel like a man of unclean lips that you were just filthy and dirty and you had to be cleansed washed and then it got all done you had to do god's will but we want to make church what we want to make it who am i to say what church should be who are you to say what church should be [Applause] i think it should be about getting serious with god amen amen amen it's the message we heard the message from the beginning love one another amen we heard the message at the end time from the messenger himself comes back with a report where we put in our emphasis you have to choose to walk in the spirit when you are loving one another without respect to persons there's no animosity no hurt i can tell you of assuredly you're walking in the spirit right amen but when you hold things when you think things when you allow certain things to go unharnessed and you don't bring it under subjection i don't care how much you quote the word it's not a choice to walk with the word it's a choice to walk with the spirit of the word amen choosing to walk in the spirit hallelujah this i say then walk in the spirit and you shall not fulfill the lust of the flesh first john chapter 3 verse 13 marvel not my brethren if the world hates you we know that we have passed from death unto life because we love the brethren amen right not because we got all the mysteries got all the knowledge profits nothing but we know we have a revelation a rock-solid revelation we know that we have passed from death unto life because we love the brethren and he that loveth not his brother he abides in death amen so i'll set before you this day life and death right the choice to walk in the flesh or to walk in the spirit the choice to love god or love with their respective persons verse 15 but whosoever hateth his brother is a murderer and we know that no murderer have eternal life abiding in him shouldn't be anything about i'm going to a place of eternal life it should be about what's abiding in you hereby perceive we the love of god because he laid down his life for us we ought to lay down our lives for one another that's what we should be doing oh brother john i'm pretty busy and you know this covet and you know whatever i know the word that's what i know this is what we should be doing i don't want to preach another gospel i want to be a curse i don't want to get on another side so you lied to me what kind of friend would i be here you are you come you give your time you submit why would i want to come short of telling you nothing but the pure truth all right let's get ready to wrap this up two more quick verses john 15 verse 12. john 15 verse 12 this is my commandment that you love one another as i have loved you greater love have no man this and a man lay down his life for his friends john 13 35 by this shall all men know that you're my disciples if you have love one for another amen jesus sets before us a choice now though it is his commandment and he says i command you that you love one another it's still a choice because of free more agency and we can choose life we can choose to walk in the spirit we can choose to love if i ever go to a place in it ever ever in my mind to think of why this person that's standing in front of me or that i'm talking with doesn't deserve to be loved with the pure love of god that's really good you will automatically lose every time it's not a matter whether that person's worthy it's a matter of the one that called you and loves you when you are unworthy to let that same love love through you to that person you're just a vessel you're just an extension cord it's not about delegating and putting in proper carnal order where everybody is right it's about spiritually putting everybody on the same plane love one another walk in the spirit and you'll not fulfill that lust of the flesh amen together what a grand opportunity we have to think that i'm not a robot and have a choice a choice to love when i'm not being loved a choice to lay down my life when the person i'm doing it for wouldn't even think about laying down his life for me that's awesome to me that now if all i'm doing is thinking currently about my relationship with that person oh boy oh that's just not fair well it's not about you and your relationship with that person it's about you and your relationship with god amen that's what's important because when i get to having the right one when i get that when i get to the judgment bar there's not one person on the planet that can get me in saint peter won't be standing by the gate with the keys and saying well you know he did all right no one i got to stand for him if i stand for him he'll stand for me so what's important is not between you and that person it's been between you and god and god has called us to lay down our life to depart from iniquity to take to get away from anything that causes us to not walk in the spirit and make that choice i'm gonna i'm choosing today to walk in the spirit i'm gonna go in this direction i'm gonna get more serious about it when i come to church i'm gonna start making the services amen i'm gonna start listening for the voice of god when i read and when i get on my knees i want to be more real i want this thing to be real not just a religion amen is that your desire today amen amen let's look to the lord in prayer father we lift before you our desire to please you to walk with you to be closer to you lord is this little sermon choosing to walk in the spirit we're making that choice lord we know that tomorrow when we get up the devil has a whole set of plans to disturb us to take our focus away from the message today to get us so drowned with issues and health problems and work problems and financial problems and marital problems and and family problems and car troubles and trying to get us to walk in the flesh lord i pray that you'd give each and every one of us thy sufficient grace to remember to make the choice to regardless of what's happening to choose to walk with you in the spirit we know that you said you'd never leave us or forsake us but lord we don't have that same testimony of you we've left you many times lord we don't want that we want to be sealed with the holy ghost we want to go through the furnace with you we want to go into the lion's den with you and lord when we begin to run away from you we want to be in the belly of a great fish with you i believe one place david said if i make my my bed in hell thou art with me that's right lord i sincerely pray that you'd help each one of us to be more serious about the things that you're trying to get rid of in our lives for your word says that he that's pure purifies himself and your bride has made herself ready lord we're making that choice to walk with you to get ready for your coming lord we're not asking to know the day or the hour but what we are asking for is that you'd feel so full of your spirit that we just serve you from the depths of our heart every day thus thy people lord they are yours they love you they love you they want to love you more but they want to fulfill your desire and your your pleasure [Music] love one another lay everything aside until they can love like you bless them lord jesus bless them we thank you for these things lord we commit our life to you we ask these things humbly now in jesus christ's name amen amen if you want
