[29:05] amen just want to see if you're
[29:10] awake praise the Lord amen you turn me
[29:13] this morning to St John chapter
[29:16] 4 for opening
[29:20] scriptures
[29:26] amen St John chapter 4 starting with
[29:29] verse
[29:30] 1 when therefore the Lord knew how the
[29:34] Pharisees had heard that Jesus made and
[29:36] baptized more disciples than John though
[29:40] Jesus himself baptized not but his
[29:42] disciples he left Judea and departed
[29:45] again unto Galilee and he must needs go
[29:49] through
[29:50] Samaria then cometh he to a city of
[29:52] Samaria which is called sikar near to
[29:55] the parcel of ground that Jacob gave to
[29:58] his son Joseph and now Jacob's Well was
[30:01] there and Jesus there being wearied with
[30:04] his journey sat thus on the wall and it
[30:08] was about the sixth hour and there came
[30:11] a woman of Samaria to draw
[30:15] water amen let's just bow our heads for
[30:18] a word of prayer Heavenly Father we're
[30:21] so grateful Lord Jesus that you left us
[30:25] a testimony in this day Lord that we
[30:28] would not be stumbling about in
[30:31] darkness Lord as those that don't have a
[30:34] light they just stumble to and fro but
[30:37] Lord you have sent us a light you've
[30:39] sent us a great light Lord that we might
[30:41] see plainly where we should walk
[30:44] heavenly father I pray that you just
[30:46] come this morning pray that you bless
[30:48] brother John in the service that he's in
[30:50] Lord bless the Fellowship of the
[30:52] brothers there in Holland Lord I pray
[30:55] father that you'll just come Lord and
[30:58] not only bless him but may you come and
[30:59] bless us bless the hearers bless our
[31:02] hearts may you speak to us plainly Lord
[31:05] we love you we thank you Father for all
[31:07] things in Jesus Christ's name we ask it
[31:10] amen amen you may be
[31:13] seated like to speak to you this morning
[31:16] about The Well of
[31:18] Grace amen amen yesterday when I was
[31:24] looking at this I I thought the wording
[31:26] of verse one was a little
[31:30] strange I don't know if you looked at
[31:32] verse one it says when therefore the
[31:34] Lord knew how the Pharisees had heard
[31:37] that Jesus made and baptized more
[31:40] disciples than John I thought it was odd
[31:43] that that says the Lord who is
[31:46] Jesus I just I I puzzled at that so
[31:50] maybe one day the Lord will show
[31:52] me what that's all
[31:55] about but this morning it says here in
[31:57] verse six it says so Jacob's Well was
[31:59] there and Jesus therefore being wearied
[32:03] with his journey sat thus on the well
[32:07] and it was about the sixth hour we know
[32:10] that the sixth hour is is the day you
[32:14] know six is kind of a time of of man's
[32:18] day and it's a time of of trouble and
[32:22] greyness and all kinds of things and
[32:24] Jesus was wearied he'd been following
[32:27] his disciples and and preach in many
[32:30] places and and now he got to the place
[32:32] the Bible says there it said that he had
[32:36] he must he had a need he had the Lord
[32:39] had showed him go to Samaria I want you
[32:42] to go to Samaria and when he went to
[32:45] Samaria he was wearied and he sat down
[32:49] by the well and it was about the six
[32:52] hour and there cometh a woman of Samaria
[32:56] to draw water
[32:58] amen that's a very interesting scripture
[33:01] because Jesus told his disciples very
[33:04] plainly he said only go to the lost
[33:07] sheep of
[33:08] Israel don't go to the Gentiles don't go
[33:11] anywhere else and here's Jesus
[33:15] himself sitting down at the well with a
[33:18] mixed breed of people because we know
[33:19] the Samaritans were half Jews and and
[33:22] half Gentile and here's sitting there
[33:26] and this woman comes out who has no
[33:28] claim on Christ you notice she has no
[33:32] claim on him the sarapan woman when she
[33:35] came to him she said my daughter is Vex
[33:38] he said what do I have to do with you he
[33:41] said why should I give the children's
[33:43] bread to you you're not even you're not
[33:45] even part of the
[33:47] plan amen but her faith moved God Amen
[33:52] praise the Lord so it says here a woman
[33:55] this woman of Samaria she came to draw
[33:58] water brother Bram said so this woman
[34:01] she couldn't come out with the rest of
[34:03] the women you see because she was marked
[34:06] now in our country she's that's they're
[34:08] not even marked but there it is marked
[34:11] now I mean why even get married Donna
[34:15] was telling me the other day she was
[34:16] looking on the internet and she said oh
[34:18] she says the newest thing is Blended
[34:20] last names I said blended last name she
[34:24] says yeah well see the wife no longer
[34:26] needs to take the the husband's name
[34:29] because she don't want to lose her
[34:31] identity so now you have hyphen last
[34:34] names so Donna would be Donna whan Dash
[34:40] jakowski I remember asking a nurse about
[34:43] her hyphen last name one time when I was
[34:45] given blood don't do
[34:48] that she left that tourin on my arm
[34:50] really
[34:52] long and it
[34:54] hurt but I was I just wanted to know
[34:57] what she thought
[34:58] so my my eldest daughter she has a
[35:01] hyphenated last name and and I said why
[35:05] why would you do that she goes Dad she
[35:08] goes I have a professional identity and
[35:11] I don't want to lose that it's on all of
[35:13] my professional documents all the
[35:15] articles that I've written for for um
[35:18] textbooks and different things it all
[35:19] says Dr Rebecca jakowski and I said oh
[35:24] okay but now now we have we we don't
[35:27] even we don't have to hyph onite our
[35:29] names now Donna can be Donna
[35:33] wowski we can take the first couple of
[35:36] letters of her last name and take the
[35:38] last half of my last name and we can
[35:40] blend them
[35:41] together so the light has gotten murky
[35:45] but the scriptures has told us that the
[35:47] light would get murky and we found out
[35:50] that here this woman she was marked and
[35:55] so she couldn't associate with the other
[35:58] virgins the other women as long as she
[36:00] lived like that so she couldn't come
[36:03] when the rest of the virgins came so she
[36:05] come out about 11:00 amen so we know the
[36:09] six hour that that you know Sun up was
[36:12] the first hour and then about the 6 hour
[36:16] so you know you have to think about
[36:18] these things in biblical terms and in
[36:21] another message brother bam said does
[36:22] this woman come out from Samaria one
[36:25] time and she was discouraged
[36:28] she was sinful she had a lot of things
[36:30] hanging on her life perhaps and she was
[36:32] discouraged so she went to Jacob's Well
[36:35] for comfort for Relief and she would go
[36:39] there and she would get water and then
[36:41] she'd go home and you know if if you had
[36:44] to pack water lucky for us we just turn
[36:46] a faucet and water is there unless the
[36:48] well you know the whatever however you
[36:51] get your water if the the well pump has
[36:54] gone bad or the city water has gone bad
[36:56] or everything else but back in bi
[36:58] Biblical times they had to go to a well
[37:01] and they had to draw the water they had
[37:03] to dra draw the water for the day they
[37:05] had to draw the water for washing
[37:08] clothes they had to draw the water for
[37:09] cooking they had to draw the water for
[37:12] cleaning and everything else and they
[37:13] did that once a day so she was
[37:18] discouraged so she'd go to Jacob's Well
[37:20] for Relief and then she'd have to go
[37:22] back and then she'd have to go to
[37:24] Jacob's Well and then she'd have to go
[37:26] back one day day she sat the water pot
[37:28] down and there she was standing there
[37:32] discouraged and you know when you're
[37:34] discouraged the thing is is that you
[37:36] start thinking you Ponder all the things
[37:38] that you've done wrong in your
[37:41] life you start to thinking about oh I
[37:44] you know I made this I wish I hadn't
[37:45] done that and and oh I wish this I oh
[37:49] and and that's how you get discouraged
[37:51] but this was a strange day because this
[37:54] particular day the well was going to
[37:57] become a well of
[37:58] Grace it was going to become a well of
[38:01] Deliverance it was going to Jesus was
[38:05] sitting at the well and he was veiled
[38:07] God actually had come down and he was
[38:10] veiled in flesh and she didn't recognize
[38:13] that God she she was a Believer we know
[38:16] she was a Believer but she she didn't
[38:19] know that God could actually meet her at
[38:22] the well amen amen praise God
[38:28] amen let's go back here so we want to go
[38:31] back and look at the well The Well of
[38:34] Grace in Genesis
[38:37] 16 we find the first time that God ever
[38:41] comes down and Associates himself with a
[38:45] well in Genesis 16:1 it says now Sarah
[38:50] Abram's wife bear him no children and
[38:53] she had a handmaid and an Egyptian whose
[38:56] name was Hagar and Sarah said unto Abram
[38:59] behold now the Lord hath restrained me
[39:01] from bearing I pray thee go in unto my
[39:04] maid it may be that I may obtain
[39:07] children by her and Abram hearkened unto
[39:10] the wife to the voice of Sarah and Sarah
[39:14] Abram's wife took Hagar her maid the
[39:16] Egyptian after Abram had dwelt 10 years
[39:20] in the land of Canaan and gave her to
[39:23] her husband Abram to be his
[39:26] wife now we have a lot of bad opinions
[39:29] of Hagar and we know the scriptures
[39:32] talks about casting out the Bond woman
[39:34] and her seed and we know that the seed
[39:36] will not be air with the Shu and we we
[39:39] know all these things but this is a very
[39:42] interesting there there's a lot of
[39:44] things just in these three
[39:46] scriptures so we find out brother
[39:49] Brenham said this he said one day when
[39:51] Abraham was walking around at 75 years
[39:54] old and and that actually starts in
[39:56] Genesis 12
[39:58] he was walking around at 75 years old
[40:01] and he had married his half Sister Sarah
[40:05] when she was just a girl in one place
[40:07] brother random said she was probably 18
[40:09] years old when they got
[40:11] married so when Genesis 16 comes
[40:15] around you'll find out they had just had
[40:17] their 57th wedding
[40:21] anniversary they had been married for 57
[40:25] years and God had spoke to to Abraham
[40:27] when he was 75 years old and said
[40:30] Abraham I have chosen you I want you to
[40:33] leave your family your Kindred all
[40:37] everything that you have and come and
[40:39] follow me follow me to a place where
[40:43] with if you follow me I will bless you I
[40:47] will bless you and I will bless everyone
[40:49] that blesses you and I will curse
[40:51] everyone that curses you come and follow
[40:53] me and it was up to Abram to follow God
[40:59] amen
[41:00] amen and she was 65 years old when God
[41:05] called Abram she was 10 years younger
[41:07] than Abraham and Abraham walking around
[41:10] God called Abraham by Grace by election
[41:14] but we know that from Genesis 12 to
[41:17] Genesis 16 that Abram he didn't he
[41:21] didn't follow God completely he followed
[41:24] him just enough to leave everybody well
[41:27] took lot to leave oh he took his daddy
[41:31] he was leaving and but he took some
[41:33] other people with him
[41:34] too and as time went
[41:37] on the Bible says that's what it says
[41:40] there in verse three it says it had been
[41:43] 10 years that Abram had been wandering
[41:47] around
[41:48] Canaan and in that 10 years the first
[41:51] thing that happened is Daddy
[41:52] died and then Abram was sorrowful for
[41:55] that you know but still he was following
[41:57] God and then he then he got in this
[42:00] problem with lot lot got you know the
[42:03] these the herdsmen there their their
[42:06] their business dealings got
[42:09] really
[42:11] mired and they found that they had to
[42:13] separate because God only called Abram
[42:17] he didn't call Abram to bring everybody
[42:20] else with him God called Abram brother
[42:23] Bram said by grace and by election
[42:27] and then he says but as soon as he had
[42:30] done what God told him to do which was
[42:33] separate himself from his kindreds and
[42:35] everything now you might say well wait
[42:38] but what about
[42:39] Sarah he said separate from your family
[42:43] why didn't he just leave Sarah
[42:45] behind he said because well he and Sarah
[42:48] were one you and your wife are one you
[42:51] see but now and Sarah was in the
[42:54] Covenant with him because she was his
[42:56] wife
[42:57] amen amen so we find out that God called
[43:02] Abraham he was just an ordinary man he
[43:06] he I just want you to know that you
[43:08] don't have to be somebody special for
[43:11] God to call you amen which makes us
[43:15] special because if God can call Abraham
[43:18] and do something with him God called us
[43:21] and can do something with us amen praise
[43:23] the Lord amen so we find out that Abram
[43:27] you know lot went and he got carried
[43:30] away by the three
[43:32] kings and Abram came down and he
[43:35] delivered him out of the hand of the
[43:37] Kings he took him back MDC came and met
[43:40] him and everything else this all between
[43:43] chapter 12 and chapter
[43:46] 16 but it had been 10
[43:49] years it had been 10 years they were
[43:52] waiting for the promise for 10 years
[43:58] why can't God move faster than
[44:02] that isn't 10 years long enough what
[44:05] about 20 what about
[44:09] 40 but it had been 10 years and one day
[44:12] Sarah got up and she looked at Abraham
[44:14] and she said you know Abraham this isn't
[44:17] working out just the way we kind of
[44:18] thought it should
[44:21] be God she blamed God she God she says
[44:26] the Lord whom you believe in has has
[44:30] withheld me from bearing you
[44:34] seed and that bothered
[44:36] Abraham I I want you to notice here in
[44:39] in Genesis
[44:42] 15 God comes down and he meets Abraham
[44:46] and in Genesis 15:2 it says and Abram
[44:50] said
[44:52] Lord what will you give me seeing I go
[44:55] childless
[45:00] and the steward of my house is this
[45:02] eleazer of
[45:04] Damascus and Abram said behold to me
[45:06] thou Hast given no seed you have not
[45:09] kept your promise to
[45:16] me you know so many times that's what we
[45:19] pray we pray we go oh you know Lord this
[45:23] is it's been too long and now you know
[45:27] my children no longer have any interest
[45:29] in God and and now my family is a bigger
[45:32] mess than it's ever been and and all
[45:34] these things don't seem to be working
[45:35] out you know and and we stand and say
[45:38] God aren't you going to keep your
[45:40] promise
[45:43] wow Abram said the same thing to him he
[45:47] said I don't have no children and he
[45:49] said you promised you
[45:51] promised you said I'd be the father of
[45:53] many nations and I I hear I'm childless
[45:56] and all I got is elaser from Damascus my
[45:59] servant he's the only Heir if I was
[46:02] happen to die if I was happen to die
[46:05] Sarah can't claim anything because this
[46:07] is biblical and she says so he says the
[46:09] heir the only Heir I have is theas is
[46:11] elzer and elzer is going to get
[46:14] everything
[46:16] amen praise the
[46:23] Lord so we find out here in verse in
[46:26] chapter
[46:28] 16 he says so when God called Abraham
[46:31] brother brandham says in Jehovah jar he
[46:33] says when God called Abraham he was just
[46:35] an ordinary man and I want you to know
[46:37] that you don't have to be any kind of a
[46:39] special person for God to call you God
[46:42] will call you by election and Abraham
[46:46] was elected amen praise the Lord he was
[46:49] 75 years old when God called him and he
[46:52] had married his Half Sister Sarah and
[46:54] they had been living together for years
[46:56] and she was Barren amen which is verse
[46:59] one of chapter 16 so she was Barren and
[47:02] she said to Abraham she said you know
[47:05] the Bible we know that 10 is is like
[47:08] tribulation or a time of testing and so
[47:13] Abraham well he had victories right he
[47:16] defeated the 12 Kings he had victories
[47:18] he had communion with MDC he had
[47:21] victories God had come down and met him
[47:23] called him he said I am your the alshad
[47:25] ey he says nurse strength for me he had
[47:28] done all these things all these things
[47:30] but yet this part of the promise
[47:33] bothered
[47:35] Abram and it bothered
[47:38] Sarah
[47:42] amen so we'll start here back at verse
[47:45] one he said chapter 16 so now you
[47:48] see this is there's more to it than just
[47:52] oh there's this
[47:54] Egyptian so Sarah Abraham's wife bear
[47:57] him no children and she had a handmaid
[47:59] an Egyptian whose name was Hagar and
[48:03] Sarai said unto Abram behold now the
[48:06] Lord hath restrained me from
[48:08] bearing I pray thee go in unto my maid
[48:11] it may be that I may obtain children by
[48:13] her and Abram hearkened unto the voice
[48:15] of Sarah and Sarah Abram's wife took
[48:19] Hagar her made the Egyptian after Abram
[48:22] had dwelt 10 years in the land of
[48:25] Canaan and gave her to her husband Abram
[48:28] to be his wife and he went into Hagar
[48:30] and she conceived and when she saw that
[48:33] she had conceived her mistress was
[48:35] despised in her
[48:37] eyes so Hagar kind of looked at Sarah
[48:41] and said H what's wrong with
[48:45] you and verse five look notice what
[48:47] Sarah's reaction was and Sarah said unto
[48:51] Abraham I'm
[48:54] sorry I wish I had not done this
[48:58] I wish I wish I This was oh this was a
[49:03] bad
[49:05] decision she said you know we should
[49:08] have been more patient we should have
[49:11] waited on God we should have stayed with
[49:14] his what he told us to do but
[49:18] instead I'm
[49:23] sorry my sin be upon me I have given my
[49:27] maid unto thy bosom and when she saw
[49:30] that she had conceived I was despised in
[49:32] her eyes and look what she says Let the
[49:35] lord judge between me and thee if I've
[49:39] done wrong let him take me
[49:42] out if you've done wrong then let him
[49:45] take us both out but let the lord judge
[49:47] between me and
[49:49] thee but God can't judge between Sarah
[49:54] and Abraham
[49:58] he can't do
[50:02] that but Abram said unto Sarah Behold
[50:07] thy maid is in thy hand do to her as it
[50:09] pleaseth thee you go ahead you know and
[50:13] when Sarah dealt hardly with her she
[50:16] fled from her
[50:17] face so
[50:19] Hagar was now in a position of you know
[50:23] she's carrying Abram's child
[50:29] but she's not part of the
[50:32] promise oh I I just hope you can see
[50:36] yourself in the scriptures everybody
[50:39] just comes they just read this stuff
[50:41] they don't see anything and I'm always
[50:43] puzzled I'm going don't
[50:47] you verse seven is a
[50:50] mystery here's a woman that has no claim
[50:55] on the Abram COV
[50:57] she has no claim on it and the angel of
[51:01] the Lord found
[51:04] her but he didn't just find
[51:08] her he found her by The Well of
[51:15] Grace by a fountain of water in the
[51:18] wilderness by The Fountain on the way to
[51:21] sh and he said Hagar Sarah's maid what
[51:26] why camest thou and where will you go
[51:30] and she said I will flee from the face
[51:32] of my mistress Sarah and the angel of
[51:35] the Lord said unto her just think about
[51:38] this person has no claim on the promise
[51:40] of God yet God sent an angel to talk to
[51:45] her and God spoke to her and said go
[51:49] back to thy to
[51:53] Sarah they return to thy mistress and
[51:56] sub commit thyself under her hands and
[51:59] the angel of the Lord said unto her I
[52:01] will multiply thy seed exceedingly and
[52:04] it shall not be numbered for multitude
[52:07] and the angel of the Lord said unto her
[52:09] behold thou art with child and shall
[52:12] bear a son and shall call his name
[52:15] ishmail because the Lord hath heard of
[52:20] the Lord hath heard thy Affliction you
[52:23] mean God actually could hear this from
[52:26] this
[52:27] woman that had no claim on the
[52:32] promise she had no claim on the promise
[52:36] yet God heard
[52:37] her and he said and he will be a wild
[52:40] man and his hand will be against every
[52:41] man and every man's hand against him and
[52:44] he shall dwell in the presence of all of
[52:48] his Brethren
[52:50] amen praise God
[52:53] Amen brother Brenham said he says so
[52:55] notice hey AR she had been put out of
[52:58] her home she had a little nursing boy
[53:03] ishmail and she went under into the
[53:05] desert no place to go
[53:08] let's yeah so she had gone out
[53:13] there and in verse 13 it says and she
[53:17] called the name of the of the Lord that
[53:20] spake unto her the god that seest me for
[53:24] he said have I all also here looked
[53:28] after him that seeth me you know
[53:32] the wherefore the well is
[53:35] called and I'm not really sure how to
[53:37] say that beer laai behold it is between
[53:41] cadesh and bed and what it really means
[53:45] is The Well of him that liveth and seeth
[53:48] me and Hagar bear Abram a son and Abram
[53:51] called his son's name which Hagar bear
[53:54] ishmail and Abram was 86 years old when
[53:58] Hagar bear ishal to Abraham praise the
[54:02] Lord
[54:06] amen Hagar she'd been put out of her
[54:08] home she had a little nursing boy
[54:10] ishmail she'd gone out in the desert
[54:12] with no place to go the water run out
[54:14] and what she could do she had been
[54:16] raised in a home that was acquainted
[54:18] with The Rock and what did she do she
[54:20] didn't want to see that baby die so she
[54:22] took him a little fellow and she laid
[54:24] him under a tree she went off about a
[54:26] bow shot and she fell down on her knees
[54:28] and she spoke to the Rock and The Rock
[54:30] put forth his Waters and the baby was
[54:33] survived and to this day this bear laori
[54:38] still stands there that fountain that
[54:40] The God Who hath seen me she spoke to
[54:44] the Rock BEC um for her dying baby Amen
[54:49] in Genesis
[54:51] 21 verse
[54:54] 13 one
[54:59] in verse 13 it
[55:00] says well let's let's
[55:04] um let's let's read verse 12 and God
[55:08] said unto Abraham let it not be
[55:10] Grievious in thy sight because of the
[55:12] lad that's because of ishmail or because
[55:14] of the Bond woman in all that Sarah hath
[55:17] said unto thee hearken unto her voice
[55:19] for in Isaac shall thy seed be called
[55:22] and also of the son of the Bond woman
[55:25] will I make a nation
[55:27] because he is thy
[55:30] seed he couldn't let ishmail die because
[55:35] he was the Seed of
[55:37] Abraham
[55:39] amen
[55:41] amen and that
[55:44] that word that Hebrew word which we
[55:47] can't really s but we're going to say
[55:49] from here on out it's The Well of him
[55:51] that liveth and seeth me and that's
[55:54] unmar Grace
[55:56] the grace of
[55:59] God God didn't have to hear Hagar In
[56:03] fact the only reason God heard Hagar was
[56:07] because Abraham's seed was inside of her
[56:11] amen
[56:14] amen so brother Rams in Abraham's
[56:17] Covenant confirmed I really like this he
[56:19] says so now in the 17th chapter let's
[56:22] get this it says this is beautiful three
[56:25] times
[56:26] God made mention of the confirmation of
[56:29] the C Covenant first in Genesis 13:14
[56:33] when he separated himself and obeyed
[56:35] then he told him he said I'll make you
[56:37] like the Sands of the sea and then in
[56:39] Genesis 15 he says I'll make you like
[56:42] the stars of heaven and then he waited
[56:45] till Genesis 17 he appeared to him after
[56:50] listen after this great
[56:54] trial wait a minute and I missed the
[56:59] trial I missed the
[57:01] trial what great trial he went and he
[57:04] fought MDC came and and gave him wine
[57:08] and and they they had Fellowship
[57:11] together where was the
[57:15] trial the trial was waiting on God to
[57:20] bring his word to pass
[57:29] he said he appeared to him after this
[57:32] great trial where Sarah had went off of
[57:35] the line and you know God would have
[57:38] slew
[57:40] Sarah oh here's a beautiful thing when
[57:44] he doubted when she doubted when Sarah
[57:47] doubted God God would have gotten rid of
[57:49] her but he couldn't do it because she's
[57:52] part of Abraham and that's the reason
[57:56] listen that's the reason when we do
[58:01] wrong God would slay
[58:05] us how many of us didn't pray right this
[58:08] week or read your Bible every day or
[58:11] listen to a tape or maybe you just
[58:14] forgot all about Wednesday night maybe
[58:18] you were just too busy to serve God God
[58:21] would slay
[58:25] us brother bham says I could never come
[58:28] here and preach a Revival no other
[58:30] preacher could you'd never have a
[58:33] Revival you'd be cut off forever but he
[58:37] can't do it praise the
[58:39] Lord he can do it praise the Lord
[58:45] amen he can't do it he cuts his own son
[58:49] off if he
[58:51] does see for the wife is a part of the
[58:55] husband they're no longer Twain they're
[58:57] one so he couldn't hurt Sarah without
[59:00] hurting Abraham so he had to take Sarah
[59:03] in and that's the way God does with us
[59:07] praise the Lord amen no matter how many
[59:10] times we stumble no matter how many
[59:12] times we fall no matter how many times
[59:15] we mess up we disbelieve we try to
[59:17] believe with the best ability that we
[59:20] can but we don't sometimes we just don't
[59:23] have
[59:24] faith you know
[59:26] sometimes people get up they try to beat
[59:28] you over the head and say oh well you
[59:30] don't have enough faith for a toothache
[59:32] and you say okay next time I have a
[59:33] toothache I'm not going to take any
[59:34] aspirin I'm going to muster up Faith and
[59:36] you
[59:38] can't you can't muster up
[59:41] Faith and God would destroy us but he
[59:46] can't because we're part of
[59:49] Abraham which is Jesus Christ we're part
[59:53] of him his seed dwells in in us and if
[59:57] it dwells in us it's going to Blossom
[1:00:00] one day amen praise the Lord
[1:00:05] amen you'd be cut off forever but he
[1:00:08] can't do it he cuts his own son off if
[1:00:10] he does see for the wife is a part of
[1:00:12] the husband they're no longer Twain
[1:00:14] they're one so he couldn't hurt Sarah
[1:00:17] without hurting Abraham so he had to
[1:00:19] take Sarah in and that's the way God
[1:00:20] does to us our sins he depart from us a
[1:00:24] long time ago but we're in Christ
[1:00:29] hallelujah praise the
[1:00:31] Lord amen I accepted his sacrifice not
[1:00:36] mine
[1:00:38] his
[1:00:39] amen I can't even give up my own
[1:00:43] will oh well I know you're afraid to
[1:00:46] admit that
[1:00:48] but you think of how many times we come

[1:04:11] well praise God
[1:04:15] Amen Abraham had come through this big
[1:04:17] test and had this son of ishmail which
[1:04:20] was absolutely
[1:04:27] bad amen amen aren't you glad for that
[1:04:31] well
[1:04:34] amen let's take a look at another Well
[1:04:38] amen over in Genesis
[1:04:40] 24 we find out that
[1:04:43] elzer
[1:04:45] that
[1:04:47] God had a son named Isaac Abraham had a
[1:04:54] son he had Abraham had many sons he had
[1:04:58] three different
[1:04:59] wives and he had lots of
[1:05:02] sons and God had said thy seed I'll
[1:05:06] bless your seed but when you go and look
[1:05:08] at the scriptures Abram Abram one time
[1:05:11] was praying he says oh Lord he says oh
[1:05:13] that ishmail would stand before your
[1:05:16] face oh that he would just be pleasing
[1:05:18] to you and God looked at him and said no
[1:05:20] you're not getting this it isn't he that
[1:05:23] runneth or he that willth or he that
[1:05:25] praise the most he says it is God that
[1:05:28] showeth Mercy Isaac is who the promis is
[1:05:31] with and I have chosen I will make my
[1:05:35] word come to pass and you don't have a
[1:05:38] say in it only get will yourself to the
[1:05:41] Potter amen praise the
[1:05:44] Lord
[1:05:47] amen so we find out here in Genesis
[1:05:51] 24 that Abram got old and he called
[1:05:54] eleazer and he said Eliezer he says I
[1:05:57] need an uh I need a
[1:06:00] bride for my for my son the son of the
[1:06:04] promise and he needs to go and get uh
[1:06:08] don't don't go out here and get one of
[1:06:10] these but go and get a a bride for you
[1:06:15] know don't go to Canan don't go to all
[1:06:18] these unbelievers go and find somebody
[1:06:21] of our
[1:06:22] bloodline amen go and find somebody
[1:06:26] go and find go back to where we came
[1:06:30] from Brother you ever get a revelation
[1:06:32] of that you realize that this flesh has
[1:06:36] nothing to do with anything and that you
[1:06:38] came from God and you're going back to
[1:06:41] God Amen praise the
[1:06:46] Lord and then Genesis 24 and verse
[1:06:50] 10 so it says and the servant took 10
[1:06:54] camels of the camels of his master and
[1:06:58] he departed for all the goods of his
[1:07:00] master were in his hand and he arose and
[1:07:02] he went to Mesopotamia unto the city of
[1:07:04] nahor and he made his camels to kneel
[1:07:08] down without the City by a well of water
[1:07:12] at the time of the
[1:07:13] evening that is exactly the same setting
[1:07:18] as St John
[1:07:20] for it's the exact same setting
[1:07:25] Eleazar didn't go in the city he stayed
[1:07:28] outside the
[1:07:29] city if you go and you look in St John 4
[1:07:32] it says now the Jacob's Well was there
[1:07:35] but it wasn't in the city it was outside
[1:07:36] the
[1:07:37] city and he said everyone had to come to
[1:07:40] that well to to get
[1:07:42] water amen and Jesus had a need to be
[1:07:46] there because the Unseen seed there was
[1:07:50] a seed in that woman that she didn't
[1:07:53] know about but she had a cry to know
[1:07:56] God the day that she got up that morning
[1:08:00] she she was on number
[1:08:02] six she was looking she was thinking you
[1:08:05] know you know how you are when you're
[1:08:07] young and you meet the first one and you
[1:08:10] say oh this this is the one and she
[1:08:12] probably thought this is the one and
[1:08:14] then he turned out to not be the one
[1:08:16] then she got another one and then she
[1:08:17] thought well this is the one and then he
[1:08:19] wasn't the one either and then after she
[1:08:21] had five and Jesus told her he said the
[1:08:24] one you got now ain't the right one
[1:08:26] either that's what he told her but she
[1:08:29] got up that morning you know and here
[1:08:31] the the apartment was a mess the dishes
[1:08:34] were all dirty and everything else and
[1:08:36] she's tired of life she's tired of
[1:08:38] everything but she's got a cry in her
[1:08:40] heart for God she's got a cry in her
[1:08:44] heart oh if I could just if I could just
[1:08:48] talk to him just like Hagar she said oh
[1:08:53] she said she was she was so
[1:08:56] she said why is everything against me
[1:08:58] and everything so hard and and all these
[1:09:00] things are wrong and now here and God
[1:09:03] sent an angel to that woman because the
[1:09:06] seed that she was carrying praise the
[1:09:10] Lord amen
[1:09:13] amen and that woman in in St John 4 she
[1:09:16] got up she was she was tired of it she
[1:09:20] was tired of her life she was tired of
[1:09:22] the Rat Race she was tired of of all the
[1:09:25] monotony of it and everything else and
[1:09:28] and she got her water pot and she goes
[1:09:30] down to the
[1:09:32] well The Well of
[1:09:35] Grace The Well of the god that liveth
[1:09:39] and seeth
[1:09:40] me
[1:09:42] amen amen the same
[1:09:46] place maybe not the same well but it's
[1:09:49] still a well of
[1:09:51] Grace it's the same well where elaser
[1:09:54] sat down outside the City and he had a
[1:09:56] prayer and he said oh he said Lord he
[1:10:00] said the god of Abraham not my God God
[1:10:03] of Abraham I know you're talking to
[1:10:05] Abraham and I'm just his servant he says
[1:10:08] here I'll set these 10 camels down and
[1:10:10] he says and I'll pray God the one that
[1:10:13] you have chosen not the one that I look
[1:10:16] on and I choose with my eyes the one you
[1:10:19] have chosen let her come out and when I
[1:10:22] asked her for a drink he said let her
[1:10:24] not only give water to me but also water
[1:10:27] for all the
[1:10:29] camels let her be willing to do
[1:10:32] that St John 4 is the exact same
[1:10:35] thing she come out of the city she was
[1:10:39] away from everybody
[1:10:41] else
[1:10:44] discouraged and a man sitting in the

[1:11:27] to because I am the Unseen God that
[1:11:30] seeth you and can give you the hand of
[1:11:34] Grace he said you'd be asking me for
[1:11:36] some water and she look in a while and

[1:21:01] they blessed Rebecca and they said un
[1:21:03] her Thou Art our sister be thou the
[1:21:05] mother of thousands of millions and let

[1:21:22] damsels and they rode upon the camels
[1:21:24] and followed the man and the servant
[1:21:26] took Rebecca and went his way and verse
[1:21:29] 62 and Isaac came from the way of the
[1:21:33] well the god that liveth and seeth
[1:21:40] me the same
[1:21:44] well that God LED Hagar
[1:21:47] to was the same
[1:21:50] well where Isaac came go look it up
[1:21:56] the only difference is it says beer and
[1:21:59] then it's the same word and the way the
[1:22:01] Hebrew is written is that there's
[1:22:04] there's a a prefix and it's a
[1:22:08] location and then there's the word
[1:22:11] itself and it's the same well God Isaac
[1:22:17] dwelt he came by that same well for he
[1:22:20] dwelt in the South Country and Isaac
[1:22:23] went out to meditate in the in the field
[1:22:25] when not in the morning but at the

[1:22:49] one day the god that liveth and seeth me
[1:22:54] was sitting by the
[1:22:55] well and when he set forth his hand to
[1:22:59] her the Bible says she when she came he

[1:27:12] is
[1:27:13] wrong and the Jews have no dealings with
[1:27:16] the Samaritans but God crosses over all

[1:43:19] beginning so you go what yeah there's a
[1:43:22] little disc
[1:43:24] discrepancy Genesis
[1:43:26] 26 starting at Verse 18 and Isaac did
[1:43:31] died again the wells of water which they
[1:43:34] had digged in the days of Abraham his
[1:43:36] father amen for the Philistines had
[1:43:40] stopped them up after the death of
[1:43:42] Abraham and you know that's all people
[1:43:44] are trying to do they're trying to stop
[1:43:46] up the well they're trying to tell you
[1:43:49] oh no brother bram's gone we can't do
[1:43:52] that anymore okay do this anymore and
[1:43:54] they just stop up the wells just say I
[1:43:56] believe might as well say Li out your
[1:43:58] tongue and put the ho Eucharist on it
[1:44:00] you got the message and now we're going
[1:44:02] home God is still
[1:44:05] true there's still a well of water amen
[1:44:09] they're still
[1:44:12] amen and they had stopped up these Wells
[1:44:15] when Abraham passed away and he called
[1:44:18] their names after the names by which his
[1:44:21] father had called them and Isaac
[1:44:23] servants diing in a valley and they
[1:44:24] found there a well of springing water
[1:44:26] and the Herdman of guer did strive with
[1:44:29] Isaac's herdsman saying the water's ours
[1:44:33] yeah yeah I remember the first time I
[1:44:35] heard that oh yeah I said a can't
[1:44:39] meeting I seen this preacher this
[1:44:41] preacher come and met me I talking to
[1:44:43] him he says you saved I said oh you know
[1:44:46] it he goes how old are you I said I
[1:44:50] don't know 26 or something he goes you
[1:44:53] born after 1963 and I said yeah and he
[1:44:55] goes well you ain't saved cuz in the
[1:44:58] seals book brother brandham said the the
[1:45:00] names are all done book is closed he's
[1:45:03] come off the throne tonight I said
[1:45:06] really kind of late that Well's been
[1:45:09] unstuffed in my house it's still living
[1:45:12] it's still flowing I'm you know the
[1:45:15] Philistines are still upon us they're
[1:45:18] tell doubters and oh all kinds of crazy
[1:45:21] things amen come to the well amen The
[1:45:25] Well of Grace be filled with the spirit
[1:45:28] amen your lamps trimmed in clear
[1:45:31] hallelujah amen oh yeah so they they
[1:45:36] they found this well the herdsman agreer
[1:45:39] said nope that water's ours so he told
[1:45:42] him he said well this is Strife the name
[1:45:45] of that well is called Strife because
[1:45:47] they strove in him so they dug another
[1:45:49] well and they they got mad at him again
[1:45:54] amen and he said he called the name of
[1:45:56] that sitna which means attack or malice
[1:46:00] and hatred that's what it means so first
[1:46:02] it's just Strife but then when it
[1:46:04] becomes
[1:46:06] manifest Strife is just you know an
[1:46:09] argument but it turns into malice turns
[1:46:12] into hatred and that causes death causes
[1:46:16] murder amen and he moved from then and
[1:46:19] died another well and and they and that
[1:46:22] one they strove not not and he called
[1:46:23] the name of that rabo and he said for
[1:46:27] now the Lord hath made room for all of
[1:46:29] us and we shall be fruitful in the land
[1:46:32] amen
[1:46:34] Amen brother bam in the Seal of
[1:46:36] antichrist he says you know Jacob want
[1:46:39] to dug a well and the Philistines run
[1:46:42] him away from it and I believe he called
[1:46:44] it malice and he dug another one they
[1:46:46] run him away from that and he called it
[1:46:47] Strife so he dug another one and he said
[1:46:50] there's room for us all so hope can dig
[1:46:53] that well in this coming year don't you
[1:46:55] so there'd be room for us all everybody
