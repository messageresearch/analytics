yet a little while is the light with you walk while you have the light lest Darkness come upon you for he that walketh in darkness knoweth not where he goeth and while you have light believe in the

amen so I'd like to speak tonight and this is a it's a funny title but why are you afraid there's Troublesome times ahead lots of things are going on there's there's earthquakes in diverse places California Los Angeles just had a great big earthquake um it kind of scared him and there's fires there's fires up in San berino there's fires in Greece Greece they had an awful fire in Athens there's you know men's you know the stock market took a big crash just recently and then we have 84 days before the election oh who's going to be what are we going to do what happens if this happens oh the economy is a mess how am I going to pay my bills oh I prices are going up everything there's lots of things to worry about but the question is why are you afraid with all these things shaking and all these things go all these things happening you need to know where you stand not where I stand where you stand brother brandom said some time ago we were setting one of my first trips here to Arizona to go hunting and we were sitting out here near the Superstition Mountain and I had heard of it for a long time and I heard many of the legends that had been told about the Superstition so I looked it up I said well there is actually a place called Superstition Mountains and it's east of Phoenix and the what makes it real famous it's the Lost uh Dutchman's Gold Mine is supposed to be up there and brother random said so he said I remember looking at it the first time it was before day and a great ghostly Shadow hung at the east of me which was known as the Superstition and I'd heard about the Indians and how they would wouldn't go near it and how they were afraid and how the Spanish had mistreated them in the early days when they were hunting gold and they claimed that evil spirits lived in there and actually in Wikipedia they say that the one trap Indians they say that it's the it's the gateway to Hell is in the Superstition Mountains and they said you can go up there and there's winds and you can hear howling and people in hell so they're afraid of it and brother Brandon wanted to see this so he he went up there and he says so he says um they claimed there were evil spirits lived in there and this all stirred my curiosity but all I had was a flashlight to see the Superstition first and then I watched until after a while the Majesty of the sun began to move upon the darkness and when it did it separated the darkness from the light it pressed the darkness back and finally she raised in her highness up over the top of the mountain and it showed Superstition just what was it lit up and showed what it was and all the Spooks and the fears that I had of the Superstition when the Sun was shining and its power upon it everything fled away the sun is the king of all lights in this earth and the natural lights and no matter how much artificial light that we can have and how many great electric Rays we can produce when the Sun rises all the rest of them dim out and that's the same thing it is with the word of God when the word of God is Rises all superstitions denominational fasis uh fanaticisms and things they spread away and it shows it just exactly what it is God in the beginning said let there be light and the light only comes the True Light the king of light comes by the word of God God separated the light from the darkness in the beginning and the word of God made manifest always separ separates the light from the darkness why are you afraid amen so let's go back here to Exodus 4 we want to start here tonight take a look at couple examples so in Exodus 4 we we meet a man named Moses and Moses was he was born in a perilous time and the thing about Moses was is that the Jews they had all they had always gone to church you know they had their beliefs they were separated from the Egyptians but yet they had after 400 years they had mingled in with the Egyptians that a lot of things got got you know marinated as my wife would say all the things got together and they they had they were no longer a separated people but they were in there and and they kept hearing when they went to synagogue and that when the priests got up and read that in 400 years I will send I will get you out of Egypt I will deliver you and they knew that they had an expectation for that but in the time that they had the expectation for that everything seemed to be going wrong everything was Topsy Turvy from what they wanted they they were they were a prosperous you know they they were having children they were multiplying but but they were building you know they felt used by the Egyptian government they they saw all these things and and the laws were written against them the laws were written that they said oh the Jews Pharaoh he saw them he says oh this this this slave these people these sheep herders which we despise they're growing so fast we're going to make a federal law that all the midwives when when the child's if a child is born and it's a male child we want to kill it right now kill it right now that's the law of the land and and in all of that in all of that confusion and all of that trials and all of those troubles there was a family that had a boy and that boy had a supernatural birth and that boy supernaturally was saved from the laws of the land and he was raised in Pharaoh's Kingdom he was raised as Pharaoh's son and he had been taught his whole life that that Abraham and Isaac and Jacob that there was a God and God had s Joseph and Joseph had raised up and they he had he had been taught all those things and his mom actually taught him said and you Moses you're the deliverer and when he got to a certain age he thought he could do it he thought he could bring the scriptures to pass he thought he could make make the prophecy work he thought he could just step right into his office and he could just deliver the children of Israel but he found out he couldn't he found out it didn't work that way God is Sovereign amen so he lost everything he just he just he gave up he ran away he ran away he got off into the desert and he was out there and he started you know he was talented and everything he he got a wife and a child and and he was a sheep herder and and he was successful in what he did and one day one day God in his Sovereign Grace God had a per a Time chosen he had a reason that he attracted Moses's attention amen so I want to pick up right there there he says so in Exodus 4:1 it says and Moses answered and said but behold they will not believe me nor hearken unto my voice for they will say the Lord hath not appeared unto thee and the Lord said unto him what is that in thine hand and he said a rod he said cast it on the ground and he cast it on the ground and it became a serpent and Moses fled from before it and the Lord said unto Moses put th forth thine hand hand and take it by the tail and he put forth his hand and he caught it and it became a rod in his hand that they may believe that the Lord God of their fathers the god of Abraham the god of Isaac and the god of Jacob hath appeared unto thee amen just show them the snake and they will believe that the gods of their fathers has sent you to me and the Lord said furthermore unto him put now thine hand into thy bosom and he put his hand into his bosom and when he took it out behold his hand was leprous as snow and he said put thine hand into thy bosom again and he put his hand in his bosom again and he plucked it out of his bosom and behold it was turned again as the other flesh and it shall come to pass if they will not believe thee neither hearken to the voice of the first sign that they will believe the voice of the latter sign amen find out Amen brother brandham said so now we find out this Exodus was at hand and God me Moses and told him what was going to take place and he gave him two signs but the first thing that God had to do for Moses is God had to give Moses a sign God or Moses he believed the prophecy he believed the scriptures but he needed a sign and when he was out watching the Sheep one day he saw a sign he saw a bush that burned and it was not consumed and when he looked upon it he said this a funny thing he probably sat down and had his Starbucks you know Starbucks is now $8 a cup we saw that on the news you they got a new CEO they're going to fix it and he sat down with his Starbucks and he's drinking his Starbucks and he's looking up there on the mountain and he's goes that's a funny thing that bush isn't even burning it caught his attention and when he went up and he went and saw the bush there was a voice that spoke out of the V out of the Bush and the voice spoke to Moses because God has to attract Us by signs but every sign has a voice behind it amen God met Moses and told him was going to take place and he gave him two signs and each sign had a voice a voice of the sign and every sign from God is followed by a voice every time God gives a true sign there is a voice that follows it and when you see some kind of phenomena coming along and watch it move and it doesn't change into something then it never came from God see God doesn't just show signs just to to show that he's God he doesn't have to show you a sign to prove that he's God there is a voice that will follow that sign you see signs to are are sent to attract attention and remember if the attention is attracted and it's the same old line it is in God but God was trying to attract his Prophet now so he gave him a sign he gave him a sign I thought about it you know we think about God gave Moses two signs but the two signs that God gave Moses was for the children of Israel but God gave Moses a sign God gave Moses a sign of a burning bush and then there was a voice that spoke out of that and that voice cannot just be any kind of a voice amen so it says God was trying to attract the prophet now and he gave him a sign and the voice that followed the sign was a scriptural voice there will be lots of signs and lots of things there'll be many things we'll see in the scriptures we'll also see in the message that there's lots of things are going to happen but brother sister watch for the voice and what kind of voice is following that sign amen amen praise the Lord I have seen the people I have heard their cry and I remember my promise God gave Abraham a promise that he would deliver the children of Israel with a mighty hand God has given us a promise that he will change mortal bodies and take us out of here right but we no matter how much fasting how much praying how sincere you are you will never bring that word to pass you cannot do that God has an appointed time for that God has an appointed time and he has appointed a people to fulfill that word word amen praise the Lord now God is going to speak he says by his promised word so his promise his promise to the children of Israel was that I will bring them out by a mighty hand now see I would just say well there'd be a great big hand come down out of Heaven one day and pick him up and take him out of there right you remember brother brandom said that he says oh he says the the the Pharisees and the Sadducees they said oh when God comes he's going to crank down the Out of Heaven to come a big staircase and Don will come Christ and he'll walk right up to Caiaphas the high priest and say here I am I'm the Messiah and the high places will be made low and the Low Places will be high and and there'll be Earth movers and and bulldozer and everything making everything he says that's a carnal mind he says but God will fulfill his word he shows a sign then he has a voice behind it amen God is going to speak by his promised word and he must send his Prophet for the word comes to the prophet the Bible said God said himself that he does nothing until he reveals it to his servants the prophets first see and then the sign is given and then the scripture is identified well CNN I'm going to tell you that ABC Ain going to tell you that Fox News ain't going to tell you that Hannity is not going to tell you that they're not going to tell you that Lester halt I don't care who you listen to who you Twitter with who Elon Musk don't care I'm looking for God's voice and I'm looking for the scripture amen first there's a sign is given and the scripture is identified and that's the voice of the sign you see the voice of the sign of Moses first the sign was the burning bush and the voice was the scripture I have come down to fulfill my promise and I'm sending Mo Moses he says because I'm a spirit I need somebody to work through I'm going to step inside the Veil amen didn't he say Moses Sav all these objections and everything else and Moses saidwell I can't speak and God said who made your mouth and he says and I I can't all that I'm I'm ineloquent and everything he says what happened to all the college education I gave you what happened to all this and he says and behold he says I will make you a god how's he going to do that God has to step in that side that Veil and he says I'm going to make Aaron your prophet amen amen see the voice of the sign of Moses the sign was the burning bush the voice was the scripture and now by God's help we'll find that in the scripture tonight and see if that's the truth see here's the Burning Bush was a sign to Moses that was a sign and it was given to and he heard the voice from the bush amen let's go over here to 1 Corinthians chapter 2 praise the Lord amen amen in 1 Corinthians chapter 2:2 it says now we have received not the spirit of the world but the spirit which is of god I believe all of you believe you're born again you're saved so you have received the spirit of God and the reason that you've received the spirit of God Paul says that you might know the things that are freely given to us of God God will not hold back he told his he told his 12 disciples he says well thus far he says I've told you some things but he says when the spirit of the Holy Ghost comes when the comforter comes he will reveal all things that you have need of when you have need of it not before when you have need of it he will re he will give it to us freely freely that's what it says that we might know the things that are freely given to us of God which things also we speak not in The Words which man's Wisdom teacheth but which the Holy Ghost teacheth comparing spiritual things with spiritual so when you see all these things happening and you see all the problems and all look in the scriptures don't don't look out and say oh I think I'm going to Google it and find out what what's going on because it's a sign see to the world it's a sign but they don't know it to the believer it's a sign that we know we're getting close to the end but how do we know that we're getting close to the end because we take the sign and we look in the scriptures and say Hey There It Is he already told us and then we know that we've heard the voice amen so he says which things also we speak not in The Words which man's Wisdom teacheth but which the Holy Ghost teacheth comparing spiritual things with spiritual but the natural man receiveth not the things of the spirit of God for they are foolishness unto him when you try to tell somebody about God sending a prophet and they laugh in your face you see it's a natural man there's no rece ceing Tower in there for their are foolishness unto him neither can he know them because they are spiritually discerned amen amen praise the Lord so we see that brother Brenham taught he said Moses before Moses could could step into the office and fulfill his part in God's plan God had to send Moses a sign that would attract his attention and then when it attracted his attention it had a scriptural voice that followed it and if it's not a scriptural voice then something's wrong because every sign has got a scriptural voice that's what we're going to find out so let's go to John chapter 1 amen John chapter 1 verse 35 again the next day after John stood and two of his disciples and looking Upon Jesus as he walked he said Behold the Lamb of God we know that John the Baptist was a Elijah and we know that God placed him in the scriptures if we were to take a study on John we would see that when they came and asked him you know they all came out because John he just showed up one day one day he just showed up just Jordan River the Kingdom of Heaven is at hand repent Make Way for God he's on his way in the whole city everybody they were all moved but when they came out because they did not have a receiver on the inside of them they did not recognize they saw the sign but they couldn't receive the voice they saw the sign and they said who are you they said are you the Christ are you the prophet are you this are you that and John when he answered them he said I am the voice of one crying in the wilderness which was a SC scriptural voice for the sign that he had and brother renham said he said God will do nothing so the Messiah couldn't come unless there was a prophet on the face of the Earth to identify the sign there had to be somebody standing there identifying the sign and he turned to two of his disciples he said Behold the Lamb of God and they looked and they didn't see see a lamb they didn't even see a lion of the tribe of Judah they just saw a man in clothes that look like brother Ron how disappointing is that they just looked but because the prophet pointed out the sign they followed and what were they looking for The Voice they were looking for that and looking Upon Jesus as he walked he said Behold the Lamb of God and the two disciples heard him speak and they followed the sign they followed Jesus and Jesus turned and saw them following and said unto them why are you looking for why are you following me what are you looking for what are you seeking for and they said Rabbi which is a first interpreted Master where dwellest thou and he said unto them come and see and they came and saw where he dwelt and Abode with him that day for it was about the 10th hour amen and one of the two which heard John speak and followed him was Andrew Simon Peter's brother now this is going to get really important and he first found his own brother Simon because Andrew recognized the sign but he also heard the voice he he not only saw the sign but he saw the scriptural voice and he went and he found Peter his brother he went to Simon he said Simon we have found we have found the Messiah we have found him who we have been waiting for amen Amen brother brandham in a message called it is I he said and after we had prayed I can see my dad he's talking about Peter giving this testimony I see my dad brush back the gray hairs from his face he put his arm around me and he set me up on the boat and he said Simon my little boy I've pred you to serve God to the best of my knowledge that's that's the most a parent can do I raised you to the best of my knowledge to serve God and he said Simon I like all True Believers have looked forward for the day that when the Messiah would come and I thought I would see him in my day but Simon I'm getting old now and my days are numbered and my steps are getting shorter and perhaps I I maybe I won't see him but Simon my son you are the younger so perhaps you will see the Messiah that we've looked for for all these years the hope of Israel and Simon before he comes there will be many things that are raise up down through the age saying they are all Messiahs and all these things and brother bandam said all kinds of fanaticism and all kinds of turmoil and all these things will happen and Simon's dad is telling him the same thing and when by the time of his coming there'll be all kinds of things raised up but Simon the church has gotten off on many Tantrums but I want to tell you my son you remember to believe what Moses said our Prophet that when the Messiah comes Moses told us that the Lord Our God should raise up a prophet liken unto Moses and he would be the one that we were to go to and Simon whatever you do always remember no matter how anything looks remember the Messiah will be a prophet for it's according to the scriptures don't be carried away Simon with foolish things and strange doctrines but stay with the scripture my son stay with the scripture people are all afraid oh no gas is $4 a gallon what do I do what do I do what do I who cares what does the scripture say what does the scripture say it's a sign it's a sign he said I'll shake the heavens and I'll shake the Earth that everything that can be shaken will be shaken and when I see those things shaken am I shaken because I'm based on a solid rock amen I've seen the sign and I've heard the voice amen don't be carried away the Messiah will be a prophet and the sign of the Messiah now we haven't had a prophet for hundreds of years but one day there will be one raised on the scene that will be a prophet and that will be the Messiah because we are waiting for that day now I want you to watch so verse 41 he said and he first findeth his own brother Simon and he saith unto him we have found the Messiah which is being interpreted the Christ and he brought Simon to Jesus and when Jesus beheld him he said Thou Art Simon the son of Jonah Thou shalt be called sephus which is by interpretation a stone how many people in this room know what the word what Peter means what does Peter mean you better say it louder do you know that that was a hidden Mystery that only the god of Heaven knew because you look in any dictionary you look at the meaning of Peter and it'll say aaq and how do we know that because the Messiah gave a voice and he had a scriptural sign praise the Lord amen things that were it was freely given to you praise God Amen so he told Peter he gave Peter a new name in verse 43 says and the day following Jesus would go forth into Galilee and he findeth Phillip and saith unto him Follow Me Now how many people do you think dwelt in Galilee 200,000 500,000 well I don't know how many people lived in Galilee but let's say there was 500,000 you know Jesus knew exactly where philli was and could call him by name how many people are in Flint God knew sister ly he called her by name he called sister Linda by name he called brother Keith by name you know how blessed you are that he called you by his your name in this big city in this big world did you ever read in Genesis it said that when when men started to multiply in the face of the Earth so did Sin but yet God knew your name and called you and how many people would say I ain't going but you yet you Hallelujah you when he said follow me you said yeah I'm going amen you left you followed him your family didn't follow him you told them they couldn't hear a that's not a sign that's not a sign that's not a voice that's not but yet you heard the you saw the sign and then you heard the voice why are you afraid you see God has set you on such Solid Ground you can't miss it you can't because you're here you're still following after him amen praise the Lord amen amen the following day Jesus went forth into Galilee and findeth Phillip and saith unto him follow me now look at this Philip was of Bethesda the city the same city of Andrew and Peter amen God knew Philip he knew right where he was praise the Lord now I want you to notice something here brother Brenham said improving his word this is great he said Phillip seen this happening what did he see he was in the audience when Simon came in the back door and Jesus in the middle of his sermon stopped and said hey that's Simon and not only do I know you I know your daddy you're the son of Jonas and he I've heard his prayers many times and he says and now you I'll make you a Fisher am men and I'm going to change your name I'm going to call you sephus which means Peter which we all know means a stone a Rock Amen praise the Lord and when Phillip saw that he got pretty excited about it because he saw the sign he heard the voice he went back and looked at Moses's Prophecy and he said this is that which was prophesied by our Moses and he ran all the way around the mountain on the other side M about a Day's Journey and he found his his prayer partner Nathaniel and he went and got Nathaniel he said Nathaniel we have found the Fulfillment of the scriptures and Nathaniel said well that's a good thing because I've been waiting a long time for the Salvation of Israel he says it's Jesus of Nazareth he says what nothing what Jesus of Flint Michigan are you kidding you can't even drink the water there can anything good come out of Flint can anything come out of Detroit are you kidding me yeah but you know Phillip Phillip don't care about your you know see he's there's some you know when God's got a hold of you and that hook that gospel Hook is stuck in your mouth don't matter what the name Sayer say didn't matter you know most of us we have got discouraged oh Phillip or Nathaniel why don't you believe anything I say what no Philip says well if you don't believe me come on and come and see come and see for yourself come and see and see if it's not the Fulfillment of the scriptures so what are you worried about why are you afraid why are you why what so he took off around the mountain it was gone about a day and he come back and he brought him a friend named Nathaniel And he was these things are really happening Moses said the Lord Our God shall raise up a prophet like him and here the man is and why he told Simon who he was even even who his father was and we know that what he said it's the truth because we're all in the same city we're in the same fishing Association go and study the scriptures you'll find out amen Andrew and Simon and Phillip and they were all fishermen together because God said it in the word and here it is proved that he will to is going to do that and that proves that this is the Messiah which means you have no thought but coming you have no opinion coming you think you have an opinion about politics and the economy and what's going on but you don't because if you're the scriptures you can only say what the scripture says Jesus didn't get caught up with the Pharisees and the Sadducees and all their things and their doings and everything else he said said I have come to do thy will oh God and God has come and chosen you and you have a right to say the same thing that Jesus said I have come into this world to do his will not mine and when he walked up in his presence Jesus said to him he said behold an Israelite in whom there is no guile and Nathaniel said Rabbi wow one place brother brandom said that took all the air out of his sails he thought he was quite the guy he thought he knew the scripture he says how how H how how did you know me I I just today I just met you here today how'd you know me he says I saw you when you were praying underneath the tree and I heard your prayer and he he's he's kind of like me he says oh you're the Messiah and Jesus told him he says because I said this he said Thou Art the king of Israel he was just as much as Peter saying Thou Art the Christ the son of the Living God Nathaniel was saying the same thing and Jesus said he said you think this is great he saidou going to see greater things than this all you got to do is keep following keep following stay with the scriptures stay with what God has done stay and when you see these things rise up in all this turmoil and all this stuff go and just just stand back and say Lord this is a sign I know it's a sign it's some kind of a sign where it show me in the scriptures show me what you want me to see what if Moses saw the burning book and said wow this is really great I think I'll just take a picture on my iPhone and I'll put it on Twitter and I'll get 12,000 likes and didn't even went up there what good is that amen praise the Lord praise the Lord praise God Amen can I give you one more let's go back here to First Kings 22 amen First Kings 22 starting in verse one it says and they continued three years without war between Syria and Israel and it came to pass in the third year now let's see that sounds like it's a pretty good thing no Wars everything's going fine wonderful came to pass in the third year that Jehosaphat the king of Judah came down to the king of Israel and the king of Israel said unto his servants know ye that rth and Gilead is ours and we be still and take it not out of the hand of the king of Syria and he said un Jehosaphat wil thou go go with me to battle to rth Gilead and Jehoshaphat said to the king of Israel I am as Thou Art my people as thy people and my horses as thy horses that's quite the commitment you know brother bam says and it was during the time of the reign of Ahab the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat the king of Judah and we all know that how during the reign of Ahab as far as materially it prospered things were prospering but spiritually speaking it was at a low EB but Jehoshaphat was a Believer his father before him was a Believer and then one day Jehoshaphat made the wrong move which is most likely to come to every one of us that we will make that wrong move it's so easy Jehoshaphat went down to visit Ahab and that's where he made a mistake the Bible ible said for us to come out from amongst unbelievers and not be connected and associated with unbelievers and Jehosaphat came down to visit Ahab and Ahab wanted to show him a great time so Ahab he had an axe to grind and usually that's the way the world does they have an axe to grind so when josaphat was a mighty man and God was with him and when he come down Ahab showed him such great Hospitality but Ahab said you know know there's this little piece of ground up in Rama up in rth and Gilead that really belongs to us I want you to go up with me and help me to take this see he wasn't just satisfied and I think that's a lot like people are like Ahab I say that Ahab was a borderline believer a lukewarm half-baked so-called believer notice and they've always got an axe to grind he wasn't satisfied with what he had he had to try to get more and that's the way the church gets sometimes you can't be satisfied with Jesus and good old-fashioned experience of a good old backward sky blue sin killing religion you have to go dangling around in the world after something else and the devil's always present to give you what you're looking for amen and verse five says and Jehosaphat said unto the king of Israel inquire I pray thee at the word of the Lord today and that's where Jehoshaphat made his mistake hooking up with Ahab then being a spiritual man though he said yes I'll go with you but first let's consult the Lord that's a good thing pray in everything amen so if take a little detour here though you already know all these things we are stirring up your minds Matthew 6 I remember when the Lord first showed me this Matthew 6:25 therefore I say unto you take no thought for your life what you shall eat or what you shall drink nor yet for your body and what you shall put on it is not your life more than meat and your body more than Ramen behold the fowls of the air for they sow not neither do they reap nor Gathering Burns which we all do right we make all plans we reap we go to the store we buy stuff we put it in the freezer we do all these things and then Detroit Edison there's a storm comes and there's no electricity for seven days and all of our food spoils right and that what happens but God if he can watch over The Sparrows he can watch over you amen so why are you all afraid your heavenly father Feth them are you not much better than they and which of You by taking thought can add one cubit unto your stature everybody in here everybody everybody I know of wants to lose 10 pounds and I'm telling you you can fast and pray and you probably won't because by taking thought you can't add a cubit you can't change the color of your hair you can't turn back the time god holds all these things and they are spiritually discerned and he called you out of Flint that Wicked City and he left your neighbors behind but he called you and you answered it ought to give you some confidence that God is in charge amen and why take you thought for ramen consider the lies of field how they grow they toil not neither do they spin but I say unto you that even Solomon in all of his glory was not AR raid like one of these I want you to think of verse 30 because I thought on this today while I was sitting on my front porch I was thinking huh wherefore if God so clothe the grass of the field which today is and tomorrow thrown into the fire but today it's beautiful today the trees are beautiful they got green leaves on them and it's wonderful to hear the birds singing in them and and the wind blowing but tomorrow they're going to Autumn's going to come the cold winds will come the sap will run down the trees will wrinkle up the leaves will fall to the ground is that right and Jesus said wherefore God so clothe the grass of the field which today is tomorrow is cast Into the Fire shall he not much more clothe you ye of so little faith therefore take no thought saying what should we eat what should we drink what should we wear where are we going how wish I do this why I do that oh who's going to win this what's about the election what about the economy what am I going to do about oh what the green New Deal and all whoa seek ye first the kingdom of heaven and all these other things will they'll they'll be fine because I'm from above I'm not from here amen amen let's go back to First Kings First Kings 22:6 says then the king of Israel gathered His prophets together about 400 men and said unto them shall I go against rth Gilead to battle or sure shall I forbear and they said go up for the Lord shall deliver it into the hand of the king they were all in one mind and one Accord behind a guy that brother brandom said was a make believer and that spiritually he was at a low E and all these guys they all got excited they said Oh no you're the one we we do whatever you say we're going to do it we're going to do it we're gonna do it we're gonna get with it we're GNA get with the program and Jehoshaphat the believer he listened and he said is there not a prophet of the the Lord besides that we might inquire of him and the king of Israel got really mad he said why don't you just do what I say do there is somebody Miki the son of imla oh Micaiah the son of imla by whom we may inquire of the Lord but you know I don't like him because he never says anything good about me but evil and jhus fet said well can I hear him for myself then the king of Israel called an officer and said hasten hither um Micaiah i gota i m yeah Micaiah I looked that up listen to it 100 times hasten hither Micaiah the son of imla and the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat the king of Judas set each on his throne having put on their robes in a void place in the entrance of the Gate of Samaria and you could preach three hours on that scripture and all the prophets prophesied before them and zedekiah the son of uh chamana made him horns of iron and he said thus sayeth the Lord with thee shalt thou push the syrians until thou has consumed them and all the prophets prophesied saying go on up to ramth Gilead and pray Prosper for the Lord should deliver it into the king's hand and we're going to be better off it'll be great I promise and the messenger that was gone to call Micaiah spake unto him saying behold now the words of the prophets declare good unto the king with one mouth let Thy word I pray thee be like the word of one of them and speak that which is good and Micaiah said as the Lord liveth what the the Lord saith unto me that will I speak we need Believers that believe that not what they read on the internet not what they see that got tweeted not what they see on the news it's okay to watch a news but go and see what the the sign you see the sign what's the scriptural voice stay with the scriptures Simon many things are going to be happening verse 15 says praise the Lord oh I was supposed to stop at 12 the greatest man in the nation in the military and the national site was zedekiah he was the head Prophet by the king he was the head of all the other prophets by organization he was made by his organization the head of all of them probably the best r the best educated more eligible for the job and he was anointed with the holy spirit because he was called a prophet sure not just an ordinary prophet he was a Hebrew Prophet pay attention he had the goods brother brandham said he was a Hebrew Prophet so watch him zedekiah said the Lord spoke to me make me these two horns of iron and Assemble and a prophet usually gives symbols he said make these two horns of iron the holy spirit said to me take these the anointing that blessed me don't think it's a sacrificial but to get to a point the holy spirit that speaks in tongues through me the one that's Vindicated me he said take these horns and by this tell the king that to push Syria Plum out of the country and I will give him back the land that rightly belongs to Israel the church and brother that's pretty fundamental just about like balum was up there so verse 15 so he came to the king and the King said unto him Micaiah shall we go against Rond Gile to battle or shall we forbear and he said I'm just going to tell you what you want to hear go and prosper go and have a good time woohoo it's going to be great and Ahab said how many how many times I have to adure you to say only what God has said oh that changes everything I adure Thee that thou tell me nothing but that which is true in the name of the Lord and Mah said I saw all Israel scattered upon the hills as a sheep that have not a shepherd and the Lord said these have no master let them return every man to his house and peace and the king of Israel said unto josaphat did not I tell you that he would prophesy no good can thing concerning me but evil I told you and he said hear thou therefore the word of the Lord I Saw the Lord s sitting on his throne and all the hosts of Heaven standing by him on his right hand and on his left and the Lord said who shall persuade Ahab that he may go up and fall at rth Gilead now why would God say that to his angels because he had a Vindicated Prophet named El Elijah who said Ahab because of your wickedness the dogs will lick your blood where the dogs will lick the blood of Jezebel your wife it wasn't that Miki wanted to see Israel be destroyed it wasn't that he wanted to see Judah fall it wasn't he he he could only say what the Bible already said and one said on this manner and another one said on that manner and there came forth a spirit and stood before the Lord and said I will persuade him and the Lord said unto him wherewith and he said I will go forth I will be a lying spirit in the mouth of all of his prophets and he said Thou shalt persuade him and Prevail go forth and do so now you're the congregation and which one is right both of them both of them were Prophets and the only way you can tell the difference in them is to check it by the word he said how did you get this he said I saw God sitting upon a throne and I saw all the counsil around him and remember zedekiah just said he saw God too In The Same Spirit I saw God he told me to make these horns out of iron go out there and push the Nations out of there for this belongs to us the others ain't got no right to it they would if they' have stayed with the go with God they would have had that but they got away from God and that's the way the organization is the church it's got right into these things but you've been cheated out of it because you got away from God's word and God's spirit anointing to vindicate the word of the Season don't you fail to get this message notice what taking place now he said I saw God myi did setting upon the throne in heaven his counil was gathered around him and he said who can we get to go down and deceive Ahab to make alijah's words come true my Prophet that was Vindicated I spoke that he would come and Elijah had my word and heavens and earth will pass away but my word will not fail I don't care how modern they get how good they get how educated they get how big they get my word will never fail so why are you afraid let's bow our heads for word of prayer dear heavenly father we are thankful we are thankful that you've sent us you've sent us Elijah the prophet Lord truly none of us here was praying oh God f fill your word send Elijah to me it didn't happen like that you knew us before the foundation of the world before he even

a group of people these is mine elect and I know when they hear my voice they will answer me and they will stay with my word no matter what the world does no matter what comes their way they will stay with the word of my Prophet they will stay with my scriptures Lord forgive us for getting Shook Up forgive us for looking or putting our trust in things that will fail because man's words will fail but you gave us a promise you said my word will never fail my promise is yay and amen my promise towards you is yay and amen it's already settled and Lord we're thankful we're humbled that you would call us in this age in this hour to be a reflection to be the hands of Jesus to be the life Lord live through all of us don't just pick some and not others but Lord come down and fill every fiber let us be Jesus Christ in the supermarket on our jobs wherever we go use us father for you said your word will never fail it will never fall to the ground cleanse us forgive us of our sins forgive us of our carnality but Lord I pray you take this simple message Lord burn it in our hearts Lord that we'll not forget it but father that will stay with you stay with your word we've seen the sign and we've
