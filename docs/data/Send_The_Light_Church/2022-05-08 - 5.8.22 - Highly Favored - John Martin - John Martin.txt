sinful creatures we get thoughts in our minds we we begin to get lazy and and drift but lord you're a perfect holy righteous god we're unworthy to approach you lord we've asked lord for your

bless this atmosphere lord may you may you come and lift us up into heavenly places and reveal your word to us and lord may we leave here closer to you than when we came we need you in this hour lord we commit the service to your hands lord we give you the praise and honor for all things now in jesus precious name amen amen saint luke chapter 1 verse number 26 and in the sixth month the angel gabriel was sent from god unto a city of galilee named nazareth to a virgin espoused to a man whose name was joseph of the house of david and the virgin's name was mary and the angel came in onto her and said hail in other words stop thou art highly favored the lord is with thee blessed art thou among women and then she saw him and when she saw him she was troubled at his saying and cast in her mind what manner of salutation this should be and the angel said unto her fear not mary for thou hast found favor with god behold thou has conceived in thy womb and bring forth a son and behold thou shalt conceive in thy womb and bring forth a son and shall call his name jesus and he shall be great and shall be called the son of the highest and the lord god shall give unto him the throne of his father david and he shall reign over the house of jacob forever and of his kingdom there shall be no end then mary said unto the angel how shall this be seen i've not been with a man and the angel answered and said unto her the holy ghost shall come upon thee and the power of the highest shall overshadow thee therefore also that holy thing which shall be borne of thee shall be called the son of god behold thy cousin elizabeth she have also conceived a son in her old age and this is the sixth month with her who was called barren for with god nothing shall be impossible and mary said behold the handmaid of the lord be it unto me according to thy word and the angel departed from her amen god bless you may be seated i want to say it's good to see my brother tyler and sister brooke here in church what a great day it is for our mothers i was thinking today what would be a good mother's day message and what would be a a good example in the bible that we could look to is as far as a mother and i obviously thought of mary the one that god chose and we want to entitle this message highly favored i'd like to honor all the mothers today uh i wonder if everyone could stand up except the mothers and i just want to honor our mothers praise the lord for our mothers [Applause] amen i know it may seem a little backwards but they deserve to have a seat once in a while and you may be seated it's a grand day for our mothers mother's day is celebrated across the world in over 50 countries and brother ron made a little note here about the phone calls more phone calls are made on mother's day than any other day in the world this this holiday the chats with mom often spike up to 37 more what our mothers deserve though is more than just one day the lq no the lgbtq get a whole month of june that's what they promote when i looked at my my phone it automatically came up on my calendar and so brother mark was there i said brother mark you could help me get this off my phone i've tried to erase it i can't get it off but it's stuck there in june of 2000 president bill clinton declared june as the official gay month and lesbian lesbian pride month they say the purpose of this month is to recognize the impact that lesbians gays bisexuals transgender individuals have had on history nationally and internationally but for some reason mr clinton allowed the lgbq a whole month of recognition and our mothers only get a day mr clinton who claimed to be born again i heard it myself should have read his bible before he signed off on it because we know god signed off on his word on the subject before the foundation of the world revelations 21 18 19 tells us that we can't add or take away from god's word without judgment jesus himself said in matthew 4 4 man shall not live by bread alone but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of god in psalms 119 89 for ever o lord thy word is settled in heaven amen our mothers deserve to be honored and respected every day amen in fact the bible commands us to honor our mothers i want us to realize whether we're children or young adults that when we respect our mothers we're actually adding more years to our life you're going to exist longer that's how important it is to god for us to honor mothers it's the first commandment with promise not just a day to celebrate god has designated or designed our mothers to carry out a very important role in our life brother brandon said in the message mother's day he says i might pass this on to the young people he says do you know that abraham lincoln never owned a book in his life until he was about 21 years old of course see that mothers give the kids a telephone when they're about two but the bible in the fox's book of martyrs that was the two books that he got see you uh what you read molds the character that you are no wonder we got a bunch of neurotics today little old fiction magazines vulgarity and nonsense is placed upon the new stands he owned the bible in the fox's book of martyrs and look what it made him but in the face of all that one day he made a statement like this he said if there could be any good thing found in me it's because of a godly mother that reared him to serve the lord you see a child listens to its mother some little touch about that mother that a child will listen to when it's hurt it'll go to its mother for consolation before it will go to its father because she was first with it you know and there's some gift that god gives a mother to be that way i mean a real mother now i believe that mothers are honorable and godly but i believe that such a mother's day like this is a racket made a lot of money out of flowers and things mother's day should be every day not to send her a bunch of flowers on mother's day but to love her and to care for her 365 days and nights through the year but of course the commercial world has a great hold in things like this and it depreciates depreciates mothers so i was thinking this morning what could we go through that we could really find out what god thinks about a mother and looking at mary because god had chosen mary to carry out a very important role in her life and i want to dive into some things that we haven't really looked at about mary for a mother's day theme here mary was chosen of god now we don't want to make something out of mary that she wasn't some churches uh make her the mother of god but she was not the mother of god i was raised catholic their catechism teaches that mary is truly mother of god since she is the mother of the eternal son of god who was made man and who is god himself see how ridiculous this is putting mary before mary was not the mother of god we don't want to make her something that she's not she did mother god almighty she was chosen of god for an important role we all know that god used her vessel to conceive a seed and to bring forth a perfect human being that he could become the sacrifice for our sins isaiah 7 14 says therefore the lord himself shall give you a sign behold a virgin shall conceive and bear a son and shall call his name emmanuel but in our reading this morning the angel said you should call his name jesus so jesus is emmanuel which is god with us and this son was not the son of joseph and mary the angel said this was the son of the highest there were many virgins at that time why choose this virgin was it because her name was mary from what i understand in that century so many people were called mary in fact there were three marys at the cross mary was a very common name why not even choose another virgin called mary so why was it this mary the bible says that this mary had found favor with god not just a little bit of favor now but she was highly favored of the lord she was blessed among women the bible says now she may have not have felt it but the bible says the lord was with her mary was chosen to carry out a very special role god chose her body to develop a temple that would be a place where the fullness of god's measure could dwell in there he became the tabernacle which would manifest the very existence of the invisible god and this temple one day would be offered as a perfect sacrifice for our sins so it was an important job but that wasn't her only job and that's what kind of one i want to dive into when we think about mary and her role and you know she was just uh a virgin that god had used to bring forth his son but it was much more than that mothers i said it was much more than that fathers and brothers and sisters it wasn't just because she was a virgin or that her name was mary she was highly favored but god used mary to bring this vessel up in the fear of the lord there was a a role to play after the birth to nurture in the admonition of the lord in the message mary's belief brethren said hail mary or stop you're highly favored before god oh i like that that little woman in the meanest city there was in the world at that time known the meanest city anyhow in palestine and in there she had lived such a life until god chose her wow chose her for a certain work that he was going to do now the key here is that she lived such a life one of the reasons that she was chosen because she lives such a life before the lord i'll say us don't underestimate the importance of living the life before god uses you for something before god chooses you to do something it's the little things what we heard from brother josiah it's the little foxes that smell the vine but the prophet has preached that i'll say it's the little things that we do for god that really makes a difference just do the very best that you can do every day i believe that there are many things that god would choose us for if we could just as brother and said live such a life to live such a life you know we we come to church we hear the things that we hear hoping to hear maybe something different something to encourage us something to help us understand we're looking for all good things when we come to church and then we leave here and we don't put enough time in implementing the things that we hear from god because it's those things that bring us into a closer fellowship with god we need to just live closer to god in our heart brother branham or not brother brand but the bible says ephesians 4 1 that we need to walk worthy of the invitation we're with we're called i believe this is where mary was walking with all loneliness and meekness and long suffering for bearing one another love for endeavoring to keep the unity of the spirit in the bond of peace i believe mary walked this kind of walk it wasn't just all talk with her it was the life that she lived god chose her so you know god is not going to bring forth another natural man but he is going to bring forth a bride and that bride is a type of mary she will have to do the same thing mary did walk worthy to walk humbly to have the same mind that christ has we could say that mary fulfilled colossians 1 10 that she walked worthy of the lord unto all pleasing being fruitful in every good work and increasing in the knowledge of god i just wonder how many times we actually took time to think about what kind of life did mary live after jesus was born i believe she lived humbly she lived a humble life every day she practiced it her thoughts were humble her actions were humble the bible says that god resists the proud but he giveth grace uh to the humble and she found favor with god the bible also says a humble and contrite spirit are not despised and i dwell with them that are humble so i believe that mary this mother was a humble lady god knew mary was going to act like she was something special more special than the others even though the angel told her that i don't believe she went around saying that like everybody should esteem her look at me god knew mary wasn't going to be lifted up in pride just because she was chosen god also knew that mary wasn't going to stop or even slow down after the baby was born you know too many christians after they start the race get baptized get borned again for some reason they slow down got the promise that wasn't mary yes god used her to bring forth the son but when that baby jesus was placed in her hand she was found faithful to raise him the right way that's what really sticks out to me about mary it was there was a lot of virgins brother branham said out there could have chose any of them and still brought forth isaiah 7 14. but there was something more to it than that praise the lord god had confidence in mary that she would continue to grow in the love of god even after the birth deuteronomy 6 5 and thou shalt love the lord thy god with all thy heart with all they soul with all they might i believe that that god had confidence in mary that she would fulfill this and that these words which i command thee this day shall be in thy heart and thou shalt teach them diligently unto thy children and thou shalt talk of them when thou sittest in thine house and when they'll walk us by the way and when they'll lay us down when thou rise us up and not just when they're being bad but when they're being good and when they're all the time talk to them about the love of god amen and thou shalt bind them for a sign upon thy hand and they shall be in the frontless between thy and eyes and thou shall write them upon the pulse of the house and on thy gates tonight obviously we we know that brother branham brother branham said that god chose her because the life that she was living and we know that if we're jesus said if you're faithful and little you'll be faithful and much and she was faithful to what god had given her she didn't even battle this well my human understanding doesn't understand how i can have a baby this just hasn't happened well the angel the lord said well elizabeth didn't she have a baby in her old age trying to increase her faith but you notice she didn't say yeah angel but at least she had a husband and she knew him they had something to try but i haven't had a husband she didn't go down that path she didn't lead her own understanding she trusted in god she believed the word she was faithful with what she had and i believe that she carried out this same belief in what the word said god knew mary would be serious with always teaching the love of god now you got to remember it wasn't like well jesus you know he's a perfect little three-year-old or four-year-old or six-year-old me mary i'm gonna just deal with james and and and the other brothers and sisters of jesus no it was a whole house i believe she she taught the same thing the whole way to all of them we can never teach enough nor demonstrate enough the love of god to our children but we can often come short of it mary was faithful to attend church services with jesus every time the doors were open amen the bible says the lord was with her and mary went to church with jesus i'll tell you that's the kind of mother i want to be brother john that's a little silly you're a man but we men we brothers we sisters still are mothering somebody i believe mary taught jesus as a little boy to act respectful now what does that mean brother john respectful hope you don't spend much time on that what does that really mean it means a whole lot it means not to curse not to use profanity or inappropriate language not to be rude or crude or vulgar not to push or shove not to scream yell fight argue not to steal take things not to throw rocks at others or talk behind people's backs not to take that eye for an eye or two for a tooth not to be selfish or stingy i believe mary spent a lot of time teaching how to respect the bible tells us that jesus learned obedience by the things that he suffered i believe that mary spent a lot of time teaching just because god has brought forth his word and and and and you believe that the child that you have is uh as as as a a god-promised child it doesn't mean that they're so special you don't got to do anything you spare the rod you spoil the child there's some teaching that needs to be done mary helped jesus in every way i like that's how i like the look of it was a help it wasn't being some a help you really really want to help somebody you got to get under them even your children feel for them amen mary lived such a life till god chose her god could trust mary to live out this life as an example for the boy as well to teach i believe that mary didn't have bad language i believe mary was respectful i i don't believe that mary took out her frustrations on jesus every time things got out of control i don't believe she flew off the handle started dragging him out of the house by the collar slapping on the side of the head i'm sorry that was not mary that's not the way that you bring your children up in the fear of the lord i believe in correction but i believe in godly correction i believe as a mother mary often looked to god in prayer can you say amen seeking wisdom from above how to raise them amen she didn't want to do the wrong thing she didn't want to pull that trump card well i'm your mother i'm your father i'm your parent you listen to me god chose me you better listen to me i'm the holy ghost to you do you get it a lot of times we act like that that's not the spirit of god he may be speaking true words but it's not the spirit of god [Music] i believe mary prayed with jesus faithfully she was highly favored for reasons that we don't think much about i just think she was a a virgin she was chosen by god and and that was it to the story but there was so much more to the story and if we dive into the story i believe it'll help us don't you and by the way this message is not just for the mothers and you'll see that this is just as much for the fathers and for the brothers and to them that will be as the mothers it's for all of us if it wasn't then i would just have the have the brothers stay home and kids stay home and just the mothers come i believe there are many reasons that god chose her i wonder how many women through the time through ages have have wished oh i wish i could have been married i wish i could have been the one i think there i think there's been a lot i think there's been a fair share what it would be like to bend mary to be chosen by god to bring forth a son that was without sin i wonder if they would i would just raise them right i would just i would just be the best come on you know that's the way we think like i would try harder with him than i would my own children see how corrupt our thinking is i got to believe that my children are of the lord i mean he he chose them out of one million of them he could have brought forth another one he brought forth the right ones do you believe that i believe it you got to believe your whole house is going to be saved amen never underestimate the importance of being faithful with what god has given you and god will give you more if you're faithful for what you have as a christian mother the greatest thing that we can do for our children is honestly to love god amen as a mother the greatest thing that we can do for our children is ourself love god because if you truly truly love god with all your heart with all your might with all your soul god's going to be so much in you the love of god is going to be pouring out so much in you that you will want to teach that same love to your children amen amen but to be distant from that love relationship with god and to try to teach your children right is worldly because the whole world is trying to teach their children but they're trying to do it without the love of god so for us who want to be like mary it's so simple just fall in love with jesus well brother john i'm already 61 years old i can't do it you're not too old to love god more no matter how much you love them you can love them more and the more you love them the more your kids will see jesus is important jesus is really important they don't talk about them at school they don't talk about them in the neighborhood they don't talk about them in the restaurant they don't talk about them at my friend's house but my mother right there in the front lips the front lips all over her life i see the love of god and everything she says everything she considers god it isn't just church it isn't just sending your kids to school on a bus it's bringing jesus in the home and no matter how much jesus is in your home i'm not discrediting any of it but i know this of a surety god could be more in my bedroom amen god could be more in my home god could be more in my car god could be more my thoughts it's always the right time to teach your children to love jesus more amen and more and more get to a place where they're more is there more yes i got your attention there's more of the love of god john what if they think i'm a fanatic that's look it either way they're going to think something of you i mean with seven kids there were a lot of things that i could get him involved with and i knew that i only had a short space of time with him yeah i let some play instruments uh or lessons and and and and sports and and different clubs and things but i wasn't going to run around 24 7 going to this thing this thing taking them here and there i had to make a decision god first we're going to church every day we're going to be faithful we're going to have bible studies at night i myself went all my life without joining some sort of baseball or something from myself i gave up my life for my kids i really did don't regret one thing outside of wishing i could have did a better job it's always there you only got one one life and it's so short the more that you you help them remind them about the love of god the more it will become the theme in their life the bible says does a man think it's so busy you are what you think or you are or you will become what you think so we need to watch our thoughts look at the men today they're thinking about being a woman look at the women they're thinking about being a man watch your thoughts the bible says we're transformed by the renewing of our mind that's good or bad that you know bad stuff can happen if you put bad stuff in your mind we want to put the love of god in our mind it will affect our little ones it will affect those around us the more we think about the love of god the more people will feel it around us when mary finished hearing the angel's message she understood her role this is very important she did not comprehend or understand how that baby was going to happen inside her because it had never been done before never been taught by her pastor in the church but she understood her role and this is what's important when she finished listening to all the message she understood a role and i'll tell you when we listen to all the message that god has sent in this hour we're gonna understand our role too many people are sitting there talking about things talking about what god meant here and i wonder this and i wonder that and they're missing the simplicity of just believing what the angel said it wasn't mary's responsibility to bring forth the son that was the responsibility of the holy ghost come on amen it was it was mary's responsibility to believe god first and then when jesus was placed she the baby was born and that baby was placed in mary's hands then her role was to carry out being the very best mother in the natural that she could for that little boy she understood her role we've got to understand our role as parents us grandparents us young people we got to understand our role and not try to uh understand what god's doing just do what he said just do what he said we've got to believe jesus will manifest in our his nature inside of us because that's what the word says it's not our job to supernaturally do it it's our job to believe in the supernatural and he will do it all we got to do is when jesus the word is placed into your hands like jesus was placed into mary's hand to follow through with what the word says that was special about mary she always believed jesus one of the greatest things that stand out to me about mary was her belief in the message of the hour she abandoned all unbelief all human reasoning all of her understanding all of her intellect mary asked one question how shall this be and when she was told the holy ghost is going to handle it oh the holy ghost is going to handle it yes she said i'm a believer of the lord be it unto me according to thy word that's it why figure it out why figure it out oh when's he coming oh it's going to be in 77 it's going to be in 84 it's going to be in 2000 it's going to be don't figure it out just live this word focus on being faithful to the word that the fivefold ministry has given us be faithful to it he'll do the supernatural i didn't choose mary to do some super duper things was it like everybody came over mary's house to watch her do these super duper things she was just faithful to the word we've got to be like mary amen she's the type of the bride in this age we must abandon our unbelief and look no matter what you abandoned yesterday the devil's creeping in the next day we gotta abandon it every day abandon our intellect when the the enemy comes and he's trying to get us to reason certain things we gotta abandon that thing we gotta learn to lean to the word of god amen be sensitive to what the holy spirit is saying we must receive the message of the hour the message that was given to us by the seventh age messenger as an angel as a messenger angel well it wasn't really as important but it's just as important because it's part of the word it's part of god don't be taking part out and say that's not as important as that part we're gonna miss the very thing that'll help us manifest christ we're hurting ourselves i believe that the holy ghost is overshadowing us i believe it i believe the holy ghost is actually quickening the word to our nature and things are changing in our lives it isn't just certain desires he's taken away and that's wonderful certain deliverances and certain desires but we're looking for a full manifestation here the whole earth is waiting groaning waiting for the manifestations of the sons of god where it's coming right before us it's not far down the road we're all talking about how corrupt this world is getting you can't hardly go one day without having a conversation about how bad this world is come on but how many days do we go not thinking about i should be manifesting more of christ us the bride should be focused on the word amen i like our brother um josiah said we need to lie in the presence of the son reading that quote how do we do that how do we get in his presence brother john well how about pray more how about when you're in prayer literally say god i need you the bible says draw a night of god he'll draw an eye to you how about praise him he inhabits the praises of his saying praise him more brother john are you trying to say i i'm not doing enough i'm just saying this is the way to get into the presence of the son that's what i'm saying you want to ripen more you want to be more like jesus just follow the simple word we got to die out to our flesh and jesus made it real clear it's got to be daily i believe god sent a an angel a messenger a message to us to an angel but i say it like this it's directly from god it didn't go through uh a channel that um misinterpreted the word in fact it went to a vessel that was a proper interpreter of the word a divine interpretation of the word without brother brandon we wouldn't even understand amen amen i was baptized father son of god probably still be there and the catholic church is the first church i believe in it without the prophet where would we be today he opened the word to us so we can understand it that god is still alive today we don't have to just believe that one day we're going to kind of all figure it out when we get on the other side no we can know god today we can have personal experience we can feel the presence of god today we can we know how to go in and come out we know how to go before the lord we know what kind of spirit to have what kind of attitude to have when we approach him we know what he'll accept what he won't accept we know the importance of faithfulness to god the bible said he's faithful i believe he wants us to be faithful brother branham said in the message questions and answers number two he says if you believe me to be what you say god's servant a prophet he says listen to what i'm telling you see says you not might not be able to understand it mary and if you can't then you just do what i tell you to do wow and do you think that i am going to take a second in my life and consider that the way that i understand it is so different than his if you do not have a revelation of who god's prophet is you will stumble through life you will end up coming into situations and the devil knows how to get you to question but did you know the bible if you read the bible real thoroughly you could read things in there that are contradictory that sound contradictory too it isn't just in the message he god has laid it out there to where either we're going to believe it or we don't but he made it real clear you might not better understand it and if you can't then just do what i tell you to do god will hold me responsible for what i say he said see you listen real close and remember that those things are spirit. where would i be that's that's why i'm so grateful for for the lord for this message don't lean to your own understanding god has sent an angel messenger in our age just like to mary and we must do what god has spoken through the prophet amen don't just depend on what you hear come across this pulpit what i am telling you to do is go home and put a tape on read it listen to it well brother john i don't got much time well i'll tell you the only reason that god sent a prophet in this age was to make sure a bride would be ready and if we ain't got time to get ready what are we saying the word that was sent through his message was what we need to get ready i'm talking to the mothers here i'm not talking to the females i'm talking to the bride of christ god has sent us a perfect message don't depend on coming hearing at all when you come to church don't do that it's not good enough and it's not good enough to to to to just read your bible once a week or look at the daily bread i'm grateful for the prophet the prophet said we need to read our bible and pray every day he's the one that's leading us to christ you read i tell you i can't listen to a tape without being provoked to love god more to live more true to god i can't listen to without being convicted in my heart and know that this this word is christ speaking to me not a man with some great ministry we need to have a heart like mary when we hear the word be it unto me lord according to thy word it was mary's faith in god that was so pleasing to god the bible tells us that without faith we can't please them and i don't believe she was highly favored right she had to have faith it's what really brought the attention that that please god he knew that she wasn't going to sit there and argue with the morning's message from the angel wouldn't go home you know just trying to talk about no this was an important issue be it unto me i want everything that you're saying i agree with the word me and the word are one and please god we got to believe every word of god that's spoken to us every word well brother john it's never happened to me before in my life it didn't either to mary but she was faithful to what god had given her all along she just didn't live any old kind of life she wanted to and then when it was time for god to use her okay she's going to get real serious with god no she was just she was faithful to keep the house clean faithful and everything in this message mary's belief brother bran said she threw her little hands up and tears running out of those beautiful eyes said behold the handmaid of the lord be it unto me according to thy word she didn't wait till she was positive of this she didn't wait till she felt life or some kind of sensation to prove that she was to be a mother she took his word and that was enough and that's what god wants us to do today amen not wait till we feel better not wait till you can move your your hand better or or walk a good step not wait till the doctor says you're improving but take god at his word and begin to believe it that's the only way to please him is take his word that's the way miracles are performed when god took when god is took by his word the impossibilities or the impossibles are made real and when god is took at his word not question just get it from your mind don't question it even in your mind you know a lot of times we as we know this when we go up to somebody a lot of times we have the ability to have a storefront presence while other things are happening up here and what brother branham is saying get all the doubts out of your mind just be one with the word what you see is what there is what i'm thinking you're hearing it's coming out of my mouth behold the hand me of the lord why she was so happy about it she just couldn't stand still and nothing had shown up yet but she knew it was going to be because god said so that's why you can stand up praise the lord and know that you're in god's presence when you don't feel it that god is going to perform his word because not that you heard an audible voice but because god's word said it and you chose to believe it because god's word isn't dead just because you haven't heard it audible today it's alive today you don't need to keep speaking the whole word audible it's already been spoken it's forever settled he's looking for us to just claim it now to grow up and claim the word luke 2 verse 41 luke chapter 2 verse 41 now his parents went to jerusalem every year at the feast of the passover notice here mary was faithful every year and when jesus was 12 years old so imagine this who's 12 years old here any 12 year olds okay 11 13 what how old are you 11. see one year younger than jesus in this story and when jesus was 12 years old they went up to jerusalem at the custom after the custom of the feast and when they had fulfilled the days as they returned the child jesus terry behind in jerusalem and jonathan gabriel knew it not this is not funny we went to a funeral and we left without one of our children her name is rosemary and i thought she was with another company that had already left but she wasn't she was in another room checking things out she always wanted to be a spy so i could relate to this situation i think a lot of times we assume jesus is with us but he's really not but they supposing him to have been in the company went a day's journey and they sought him among their kins folks and acquaintance and when they found him not they turned back to the place they left him in jerusalem seeking him that's usually where we're seeking wherever you left him he'll be right there waiting for you and it came to pass that after three days they finally found him in the temple that's usually where you'll find him is in church sitting in the midst of doctors both hearing them and asking them questions i like that i can imagine a 12 year old listening asking questions and you know when you can tell how smart somebody is by the question they ask are they asking like a dummy are they asking like some like they know something kind of put things together like there are certain things you could ask me and i would go whoa because i just don't know you want to we got many examples in here of people who know their stuff i'm not the guy to go to to learn how to get bugs out in fact i wish brother roger would have been in our place that we stayed because we found about 12 cockroaches and they were not all dead now where's brother roger when you need him i was going to fly him out take care of the situation but jesus must have been asking the right questions and all that heard him were astonished at his understanding and answers and when they saw him they were amazed this is my 12 year old boy and his mother said unto him son why has thou dealt with us in this manner why are you treating us like this why are you not with us what are you kind of doing your own thing thy father and i have sought thee sorrowing they were definitely moved naturally can you say that can you say amen to that and the 12 year old boy said unto them how is it that you sought me wish ye not that i must be about my father's business and here her natural father was trying to tell jesus about his business you know he had a carpenter business too you know we got to get back to work gotta get back to galilee nazareth we gotta get back and start judea judah wherever it was at that time but we see here two fathers coming into the same scene here the natural and the spiritual and here jesus was so focused on the spiritual that his delight was i can't wait to get to church i can't wait to get to the men's meeting can't wait to talk about the lord can't wait to inquire is that what david said one thing if i desire to the lord that why seek after all the days of my life he wanted to inquire in that temple to behold the beauty of the lord and here were some men as a 12 year old that we're looking at wow wow wow this little 12 year old was sharing his understanding from his heavenly father wow i can you imagine that happened to you i think some of us would have just looked at mary joseph and said look you did your job don't you be telling me what you don't working for my father seriously that's kind of spirit sometimes we see manifest but that is not the spirit that jesus had now he just asked the question don't you realize i must be about my father's business is this is there is no concept why isn't this concept is here it's part of part of my my calling and we can lose track spiritually what should be happening in our homes if we get too much in the flesh just a routine go to church come home go to jerusalem go to the feast come back and just natural not recognize that god is really preparing us for something greater amen amen the bible says and they understood not the sayings which he spake unto them they weren't connected they were in the flesh jesus was in the spirit and if we when we come to church we need to get in the spirit or it's just going to be some natural story and he went down with them and he came to nazareth and was what subject unto them but his mother kept all these sayings in her heart and jesus increased in wisdom and statue and favor with god and man notice no matter how right you are or how wrong you may think someone is the the bible says the younger submit yourself to the elder be subject one to another the word was being manifested even though there was a a a a kind of like a conflict that was happening there was there was really a tr i feel that there was like a trial right now that it transpired because jesus he didn't say oh you know i just got two more minutes and i was planning on coming home anyways he didn't do that and mary didn't understand so there was a battle going on did she ever urge to say you don't do this to your parents there was a battle there notice how it was handled the bible says that mary kept all these sayings in her heart in other words she didn't lean to her own understanding she didn't voice it out there she didn't yell at the young boy and drag him by the collar and say let's get back you should know better than that mary trusted in the holy spirit to work this out this is important for us to understand there's certain times we just really want to grind it into our kids grind it into our brother our sister but we got to learn to trust the holy ghost look at jesus he was right in the will of his heavenly father doing the work of his heavenly father but he didn't fight with his natural parents he didn't contradict them he didn't try to prove how right he was wrong and how or how right he was or how wrong they were he didn't act stubborn or resentful but he trusted the father for the situation when he he committed himself to the father and was subject to his parents see it wasn't just a easy bowl of cherries a lot of times when we have problems with our children they don't understand and when you're in perfectly in the will of the lord they may not understand this is where we need god in our home and in our lives to handle things the way the holy ghost handles them mary abandoned all her reasonings her understanding in the situation she trusted the lord to direct her she stayed sensitive to the holy ghost i believe mary maintained her faith in the word of god even at that moment be it unto me according to thy word through every thing mary held true to trusting the word she didn't hesitate to tell others to trust the lord either even before jesus started performing miracles she was pointing people to jesus did you know that before she even saw the miracles in john chapter 2 verse 1 and the third day there was a marriage in cain of galilee cana of galilee and the ma and we know that was the first miracle right that he started doing and the mother of jesus was there and both jesus and both jesus was called and and his disciples to the marriage and when they and when they wanted wine the mother of jesus said on on to jesus um they have no wine and jesus saith unto her woman what am i to do with thee my hour has not yet come notice how spiritual he was it was all and we we sometimes live so much in the flesh that we forget what god's called us to do and his mother saith on the to the servants to the servants look whatever he says just do it it's going to work the greatest thing that we can do as a mother is tell others to trust jesus that whatever jesus says just do it i'll tell you as a mother as a father as a brother as a sister that is the greatest thing that you can tell anybody whatever the word says just do it it'll work she didn't sit here and try to tell the servant well you know just going to do it like this and this and that you know it's going to no what what did um was it the john telling his disciples there's jesus follow him that's what a true servant will do is point even those that are following you to jesus it's the greatest thing we can do as a mother as a father would you would you ever want to be a brother to jesus a sister a mother just kin wouldn't it be just wonderful to be kin i know i'm stepping a little bit beyond boundaries but bear with me because we have a chance to literally be kin to jesus today today matthew chapter 12 verse 43. i'm just going to skip a few verses here but he's talking uh about an unclean spirit that uh if it goes out we got to get filled with the holy ghost quickly if not where spirits are going to come in verse 46 and while he yet talked to the people behold his mother and his brother and stood without desiring to speak with him and one said unto him behold thy mother and thy brother and stand without their desire to speak with you and he answered and said unto him that was speaking that told him who is my mother let's just get this thing straight who is my mother and who are my brethren and he stretched forth his hand towards his disciples i don't know how many were there and he said behold my mother my brethren for whosoever shall do the will of my father which is in heaven the same as my brother the same as my sister the same is my mother you have a chance to exceed we all have an opportunity to be the very best mother sister brother to our lord yes today amen don't wait today is the day i want to do more for the lord turn with me if you would to luke chapter 11. it's not about being naturally connected it's about being spiritually connected right luke 11 27 and it came to pass as he spake these things a certain woman of the company lifted up her voice and said unto him blessed is the womb that bear thee in the paths that thou sucked but jesus said ye rather rather blessed are they that hear the word of god and keep it amen it's greater to hear the word and to keep it than to think of a natural relationship with jesus come on can you say amen our job as a mother mothers is not over ever over our job as a brother is never old as a son it's never over john chapter 19 verse 25 this could be my last set of scriptures now there stood by the cross of jesus his mother and his mother sister and mary the wife of clappes and mary magdalene and when jesus therefore saw his mother and his disciples standing by whom he loved john was so humble he didn't want to say it was even him he saith unto them his mother woman behold thy son now notice the bible always called mary the mother always the word that's what the word says but jesus never called mary his mother even right here on the cross at the very end because it would take away from deity it would take away from god that he he is the bible says the beginning but he's really front before that we just we just can't comprehend it so harry's he's he's pointing to his natural mother natural one that brought him in and to the natural son not not spiritual here but this is natural woman behold thy son then saith he to the disciple behold thy mother and from that hour that disciple took her onto his own home so i'll say here here we see the love that jesus had for mary and even the love that jesus had for for his disciple john where i don't care how old we are we need a mother don't tell me there's never a time that you don't wish someone would talk to you like a mother i don't care if she's gone like my mother's past and i'll tell you when someone's feeling that role of a mother to me i i appreciate that god was looking out after john and and and mary and they wanted that relationship to keep going even though he was leaving and that's how we need to be thinking with one another most of us know whether our parents are are living not living somebody's got to step in the gap be christ to that person amen amen be christ to that person in every possible way that you can let it be on the inside of every mother to care for the younger always no matter what i don't care if it's your child or not and may it be on the inside of every child to respect and honor take care of our mothers and if it's not your mother it's somebody's mother respect them god has put us in this church to edify one another amen to build one another up and we need natural encouragement we need spiritual encouragement and let god use you to edify and to help we don't stop just because we're 30 or 40. amen don't ever stop taking care of one another don't ever slow down your respect for one another we don't know how much time we're gonna have i just got one more quote i want you to think about this my most my children are gone i got a heavy influence on anne because she's still in the home so what i do with my influence is i make sure she cleans my room takes care of my lawn does the dishes washes the windows and i'm such an influence to her no i'm talking about we have a chance to bring more of christ but we're fortunate that we got this time with her we are so fortunate i remember i've told this story with my daughter abigail my first one even all my kids were not born at this time but she was nine years old i was sitting there on the swing and we were just waiting for the rest of the family to get ready before we stepped into the car to go to church and i remember sitting there in a swing just just me and her and his birds were singing it was in the spring and it was just so beautiful but this overwhelmingness of empty syndrome empty nest syndrome came over me at that point i just knew that one day i'm not going to be with her i remember sitting in the car as sure as anything the holy ghost came in that room in that room that car i'll never forget it i've never i don't know if i've ever said it but god came in that in that car and spoke and that car was full of people and he spoke exactly that i had to let elizabeth go and it needed that for me i needed to hear that not that i was seeking it not that i was wanting it because i was so attached to her but it took the grace of god it took the great god gave me grace thy will be done be it unto me according to that word we only got a short time this is the point that i'm trying to say i got one quote i want to leave you with moses only had a short time i'm sorry jacob jacobin moses mother only had a short time with moses because they were killing all the babies and even though she found favor because moses found favor with feral's daughter and she got to raise them she knew it was just a matter of time that she wouldn't have them i mean i i believe as as soon as pharaoh's daughter wanted him in that in that in pharaoh's castle was going to happen so she had such a little bit of time and i believe she poured everything she had into her child about jesus about god about jehovah about about the the truth didn't let time go by and watch movies and it didn't matter what you did no it mattered it mattered we only have a little bit of time to influence one another pretty soon our children are going to be gone those of you that your children are gone i'm sure you can relate to this brother brandon said in the message the invasion of the united states that jacob taught moses he said that's a real mother she taught him the precepts of the lord she told him let's stand together she told him how he must be holy think about that she told him how he must be holy she told him and what he must live and how and what god must do would do for him it stuck with moses all the days of his life and any good true loyal mother ought to take her little babies instead of sending them to the picture shows and the dances and so forth like that and she'll put them on her lap and teach them about the lord jesus i'll say it like this we have been chosen by god we're highly favored we only have a little bit of time to get ready and we only have a little bit of time to teach our children amen to be a father to not only our natural children but our our children among us are as mothers or as a brother there's only so much time god has given us an open door here to let this be a greater part of our our life i believe our sister linda sister lynn she doesn't have any children but she spent time helping children in some way is that right amen brother bruce spent time doing sunday school we can be all things to all to one another amen let's say we can be christ to one another no matter who we're talking to god has chosen us may we we be the very best we can with what time we have don't wait till you feel like energized and uh just believe the word be it unto me according to thy word amen let's bow our hearts and just a word of prayer our heavenly father we thank you for laying before us the example in your word what your bride will be in this age and we thank you for sending a prophet the angel messenger in this age to give us the same message that there's going to be jesus christ manifested in our life as the word says that you are the same yesterday today and forever and though lord we don't we don't understand how that will happen we do understand our role understand that we need to to believe the word that's been preached and you will bring it to pass i pray that you would bless each each mother here each father here each brother each sister each child lord that we could just love and respect one another more that we could share the love of god with one another more that we could be examples of of love and respect and lord i pray that you would use us as you use mary to tell other servants other other people whatever he says just do it use us lord in that measure in that manner we commit ourselves to you lord we thank you for this this word now for we ask these things praise you for these things in the precious name of jesus christ amen amen sing emmanuel good to have
