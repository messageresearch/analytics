appreciate every one of you that desire the holy ghost to lead your life and by the grace of god we're gonna make it the song goes i'm gonna make it and it will be by the grace of god no one will be saying uh i'm i made it a different way it'll all be by the grace of god amen amen good to see brother and sister johnson again amen with us and and god bless our visitors um we don't know you but we want you to feel welcomed and know that you're loved amen and and god loves us all right and we are able to love him back because he first loved us amen uh well we uh it's been a while since we had a brother roger rodriguez with us uh he is from venezuela um he's here now in the states um but um he loves the lord jesus and some of you uh might remember him when he we were back in the other church he was with us um he's just a wonderful wonderful brother loves the lord and he has sacrificed a lot to be here he was in florida yesterday so uh he drove a lot just to to to make it here and he was with us in the fellowship and so we just want to know that if he made a sacrifice like that we certainly can make a sacrifice to receive the word of god that he's bringing us so we just want to help prepare our hearts and help him to minister by getting behind the word and and just and eat the word you know do what john said eat the word amen and uh we certainly appreciate brother bill sanchez it's been a while since we've seen him and he's really been uh instrumental in helping so many brothers that he's in contact with and even though we're not doing much uh overseas mission work we're still doing a missionary work uh through uh just the finances and our brother has been used so much to help find out where the needs are at and we just appreciate him and appreciate the opportunity that he could be here with us so let's uh just continue to welcome the holy spirit to have his way this morning and let's sing only believe as our brother as our brothers come to minister the word of life amen [Music] only believe all things are possible only believe only believe only [Music] things are possible only believe lord i believe lord i believe all things are possible lord i believe [Music] to be here this morning his own work work of the lord i want you to take your bibles and open your your the word the bible and we're going to go to the book of acts 4 20 4 to so we're going to read in the name of our lord jesus christ so we cannot speak the things which we have seen and heard let us pray of the elected of this time age in front of your bride lord you're beloved we are here we need your help and we need your blessings today this morning amen you may be seated we were here about two years ago around that time and at that time i felt very very blessed brother john and many of you that are here so sometimes that excuse me uh barbecue meat or the excuse could be a cake or maybe ice cream but always around and if we're the dwelling place of god and we are the dwelling place of the holy spirit we're going to radiate the word so that would always be among us and we're in service the world is going to be here and if we're in a fellowship outside and the world will be with us also [Music] like last night we were sharing like we were last night and those games those activities the word also will be there so when we are with people that are not christians we're letting them read our letter we are they are reading us they're reading the gospel that's written within us so we but if we show back character or perhaps weakness that we have and they're because the word is fixing those those faults it is a those missiles fall at night thousands of missiles have fallen and had terminated cities but we're in a worse battle than that [Music] because you know the devil doesn't bring anything good to your mind he'll say well the holy spirit is being reflected very bad in you he doesn't tell you that the god is showing himself to you he says look at your children they're whirly look at your wife look at all the falls he's got the infirmity and if you have a pain in your head oh you got a tumor now if your eye hurts behind your eyes there's a tumor so those are evil thoughts 24 hours a day what the lord says to give you but i want to share with you this testimony we have worries they both grew up together our children got together along and they love one another so my nephew was as soon as he grew up he became very rebellious and he's very tremendous he got on top of the ruffled houses he tells his dad i want to be a christian but i can't i can't when he got to be a certain age at a young age he had a child he was 16 or 17. he had a girlfriend he had a child so it was a life of hurricanes he was proactive and there was more active than he should be so one day he came to the house of my father-in-law they came like they were arguing and my father-in-law he was a christian he was a deacon in the church and he had a man a man that had testimony so he noticed that there was a a a problem there in the family so he started speaking to them he started he said to his uh my father-in-law hey grandpa i cannot be a christian i don't have the strength i desire but i can't my father-in-law pray for them that day it was a friday afternoon in the evening and they went home was driving on a sunday morning he was going to church and he saw an accident in the road and so he stopped so he looks like he's seen a card that he knew so he went to see if he could help them so he saw a young man dead on the ground he saw the car so he calls one of my brothers-in-laws that's my brother's car because there's an accident in the road and there's beside the car there's a young man dead he had blonde hair and he was slim and he's dead that's my nephew please pray for him so the brother of our church when he got near he recognized that that his nephew so he got there down on the road a man driving by said hey pray for him so the brother prayed for him oh as soon he was praying for him he just took a breath and he got back his life he was arguing with his father they're there in the house his son was my nephew was dead he had been on a motorcycle and had an accident he hid an electrical post and his ribs perforated his lungs he had alcohol he had drank alcohol and he had died but we got to the hospital my brother-in-law he hugged me and he cried he died as a drunkard he's lost and i said god is more powerful than a drunkard don't say that i couldn't be there at the funeral so the funeral was a late one day i couldn't be there because i had a flight coming here i couldn't the brother that had prayed for his nephew before [Music] i got in that family there was only one girl and there were five brothers and the father was there so the one that helped me was her mother his brother frank was the one that prayed for his nephew he calls the boys that dies father and died i got some news for you it's a news that nobody knew he said it happened that i went to the hospital on the in that evening i went to visit somebody that was sick in the hospital a neighbor and the neighbor told me something and the neighbor said he said i'm very sad and he was because over there hospitals are being abandoned [Music] so this man was moved you know because he could see that that young man was dying and no one could do anything for him and he says but then his mother came do you want to give your life to the lord yes the young man said i want to give my life to god and that woman prayed for that young man and that woman and he died [Applause] that we have promises the lord says in his word that you would be saved in your house our children but because of hope our minds become full of bad thoughts and we start believing the devil more than than the promises there's more promises there's more promises [Music] [Music] why do we believe the father of lies why do we let negative things come to our minds we have to shake ourselves and put the put the dog the devil on notice [Music] because we have the true father he has given us the spiritual truth why do we keep receiving the trash that the devil wants to give to us we have because there's more promises because the promises are bigger amen amen 18th of december not and she spoke to my mother about the love of god he didn't hear nothing about the end of the world he didn't hear nothing about the book you know apocalypse or revelation oh the world's gonna end heard about the love of god that night understood and that day she was unfaithful to my father but after that she had a new husband the heavenly husband so that day she came home given and that night she came home eating black beans and my dad was my father was scared you're going to die eating that food because beans we call beans good time to eat never made a decision for the lord he said no that's very serious i'm going to give my life to god and go back when i give myself to god it has never accepted the lord [Music] perhaps he identified himself there with her and maybe he felt her there because when somebody dies you go back to those places where you had taken with that person yeah human things you know how many here are not human we are being among humans two thousand 20. my wife says you know we live in tennessee and we're close to nashville we live in murfreesboro if one day you come by there let me know they give me free coffee and panera's [Laughter] we'll go get some coffee and that's in chicago [Music] they don't want to eat so they can save money they don't want to buy clothes [Music] because first you have to take care of the knees at home so it really is a blessing god rare to see someone like that see i remember [Music] [Music] yeah bar parlor and we met there seven or eight hours later we had a good saturday [Music] so that sunday we were in church in the service because it's a spanish congregation it's a mix they preach in both languages we found out that our his father was sick and i'm the only son i can't go to venezuela because we're we're fixing our papers to stay here i didn't want to stay here i didn't want to stay here i didn't want to come to the united states because the the lord obligated me to come here but that's a very long story my dad's sick [Music] we became friends at church he had a tambourine so when they had those fast uh songs by the piano and so i could use their tambourines i was only seven or eight years old so from then on we were just friends those days i like the tambourine better than my friends you know children's things so we went to secondary you know school and we were also in bible school become a little bigger so that because the world will mistreat you because you don't believe that the world's going to mistreat you then you find out that the world treated you bad it's when the world so my friend became in charge of my dad over there in venezuela because that's the only way you can help us a person that's sick like that if the government finds that that someone has coven they'll take you and put you in a hospital for you to die there those are the sad stories of those countries uh nurses to be with him people yeah but his health was going down so it happened that more than a week passed and he says his friend says i don't believe your father was taking his medication because the medication that i brought to him is still the same yeah my dad wasn't taking his medication because he didn't believe he was sick he didn't have covenant and he was a man that had a lot of faith that's nothing that's a little cold and he did not drink it so he preferred to go better with the friends in the corner and he would take his little whiskeys yeah there's a reality there the people have at hand there you know they used to make uh moonshine here in the united states even though he was sick you still go drinking drinking you know i spoke to my dad and you know i was here in the united states my heart was broken and i talked to my father about many things i thanked him for being a good father many things he didn't think he was going to die so that wednesday we spoke and i cried a lot with him on the phone you take it easy my son speak to him very quickly because my father is going to die quickly he had just come from work and he went he took off he said he went to see his dad and no one did it with kovac but his health kept going down from the church there there were nurses that was taking care of my dad they told him something happened last night that what [Music] remember in november he was sick and i had that little box there i had my doubts about sending it because i could see that he was he was getting worse and worse when i received the good news that tuesday i was very okay you remember the old television all you see was little lines and they were going off little by little your dad is going off so they put him on the phone and we spoke to him and i i could hear his last brief breathing the lord had already had taken him she he was the husband of a christian woman they were married for 50 years almost 51 years and he never gave his life to god and all those times i wanted to call him to the altar it was a little pool he needed just a pool but the pastor didn't want to do that but that day and he gave a testimony that he had been a christian that week and he does things that are impossible he comes and does something that you can you can do in 50 years so the testimony of my nephew and he changed the order so there was salvation yeah and that's the way it is every day the lord saving children of christians and even sometimes the christian doesn't know that it was god that saved them i've spoke to brothers did they think [Music] because there was no one that could tell them about what happened to their children there was a young man a sister from the church [Music] and he said to the friends leave me alone i'm gonna have to fix myself with god in five minutes within five minutes he died and those friends of his said with all the sadness that you have at the death of your child of our sons [Music] [Music] to know [Music] there were prayers coming up before the presence of god did you know that your prayers they never expire they never end they're always there you can pray for your nieces and nephews today [Music] and those prayers will be there throughout eternity because you're interceding because the lord says for us to do it that's why i did it [Music] and also in puerto rico they use that instrument so miguel he played michael he played the quattro and he also played the piano he also played the organ he played everything [Music] a handsome sonata his wife became pregnant for the third time she was very ahead of her pregnancy and michael he was a taxi driver and one day he did not come home two days went by and the police were looking for him three days he [Music] you know you go to the funeral procession you go through all that and i knew about him because his father was a christian i'll miss within a month a month later there was a delinquent that came to the police station with the death of the taxi driver they were the ones that made him responsible to kill the taxi driver it was like an initiation in the game in the game so his conscience was being so tormented by what he did so god moved upon him and made him he went to the police he said if i didn't kill him the other gang members would have killed him but he gave himself up because he just couldn't take it he couldn't take what he did he read in the news that he had left three two children and he the wife was that man that died his wife was having a third one but this delinquent he told a story because when michael saw that this man was going to kill him said to please give me an opportunity to make myself to fix myself up with god give me five minutes [Music] and my nephew he gave him five minutes to my father he gave him a week what if you don't have the opportunity of one minute what if you die so fast that you don't even have a minute what would happen to you we leave we need a firm rock to stand on where he went to he speak to the young people that's one of the functions that i did at the church then i would speak to the youth would tell them it's not only just to come to church and bring in your bible and being in those youth camps singing the youth choir to have an experience with god [Music] and in january and then in january the church will give you that you a paper that shows that you gave an offering and then you you use those things for taxes it's not about them it's an assurance that you say they have you have been sealed by god it's an assurance and the only thing you did here was materialized to come on the scene when we leave that we read the bible we understand that we were there before the foundation of the world when i created the heavens and the earth when this when the stars of god rejoice where were you you know that job did not have that revelation we have that revelation nightmare right now we're leaving a nightmare right now and everything beautiful that life cannot can offer us everything that's beautiful because sadness [Music] pains wednesday thursday my neck hurts and then by friday i don't have the money in the bank we are surrounded by evil and brokenness and the devil says to you okay oh your bank account is high in [Laughter] so you look at the bank and you close your bible well because the bank account is good i go to the dealer settle down no you don't have to pay no down for the car and i drive a car out here comes a little bird and he splats on your car [Music] we won't say we had an accident a little bird comes and makes a dropping oh that bothers me so much you get upset oh that lousy bird of our christian life you know we have a lot of material blessings and they're good we we have a little blessing oh yeah blessings joy alegria yeah little joys temporary and they're all temporal not the card you bought today this was the best the newest one in the neighborhood is a tornado came and took it away don't let that take away your joy because of joy i'm not speaking of being happy they're happy not speaking of being happy speaking [Music] a warrior went to the celestial home a warrior went home and that your flesh would be sad but something within you is happy oh the flesh might be sad but in the midst of sadness and problems in the midst of all pains and and the brokenness [Music] you are going to have that joy and that's what i'm speaking of that insurance the last five years of my mother she had a terrible cough every day they had given her some kind of radiation treatment and the radiation itself ruined her lungs and it was always a continual coughing oh the cough was like good for her [Music] does bother me but one of these days i'm going to conquer him and she had that cough and she would speak she would testify and she would cough and she would sing and she would cough and she would speak about the lord and she would cough and once in a while she would not come for four hours it was uh you carry your problems but you can rejoice in the lord because god has given you something that's supernatural and that supernatural thing is the joy of hour [Laughter] together let's start together because we always have to read the word let's go to romans so we can think about the uh we can start the preaching and we're gonna go to romans chapter one [Laughter] he i want to read this scripture romano uno says once romans chapter 1 verse 1 verse 6 among whom you are also called of jesus christ amen yes call of jesus christ and can we continue [Laughter] so we can introduce the theme i mean okay i feel like i'm in venezuela i feel like i'm at home and that's the way the services are in venezuela because the american culture is very formal so everything is planned [Music] people are busy [Music] sometimes we come to church with our clothes [Music] the subject that i've been thinking about for a while it's an expression in the spanish version that we belong to god because it's not the same saying in spanish to english because i say to you i'm from tennessee and then my father was from tennessee also and then my grandfather from tennessee also and then my thank you my great grandfather also from tennessee because perhaps six or seven generations you're going to look at me you're a strange tennessean and why i'm going to ask you you're going to say you don't even speak english yes i speak english when i'm hungry i have been here for many generations [Music] and you know to all americans everybody's atlantis are all mexicans oh that's a mexican that came from venezuela oh you're latin you're spanish and when they speak i know how the colombians they speak we speak they speak spanish we have many different in the culture we have many differences and dialects and they have different uh slangs and when you speak to somebody oh he's from costa rica because in costa rica they speak a little different than the other countries in central america and mexican you know from far away and if you go to south america oh you're from chile he might get offended or vice versa they perhaps they speak almost like the paraguays we come from and if you hear me speaking latinos you know there are spanish some people ask me are you from russia or somewhere because my english is very rough they're expression that you can change i might say a word in in spanish to another spanish and it might change to be very rude so because you can interpret them indirectly so over here they might sound nasty because there's a way of saying things here and they sound very very pretty very nice now if i see you with a bunch of boxes because that's happened to me and i see that you need help with the boxes i asked him one time can i help you with the box and he looked at me mean do you do you need anything i don't need anything so i asked him in the wrong way because i spoke from the spanish so then i learned can i help you yeah that's it you see how nice and tender that is [Music] so there's not much here only only for the flute so then people from the south i learned the dialects and the sounds i've been i've gone with my boss to different places and we spoke to somebody that we have found in the way and my boss says oh he's from california i said how do you know he's from california because i live i lived there and i knew how they spoke so i said i didn't understand anything [Music] [Music] we think we have a plane dialect oh i don't speak with dialect but the people from the south knows you're the way you talk why am i trying to show you where we come from i've been here three years now [Music] i've come to adapt to the customs here in this country we don't celebrate the fourth of july okay because our dependence was the july the 5th we don't celebrate the day of grace why thanksgiving because there was something that was done here historically thanksgiving is an american holiday they came the spanish they went to venezuela christopher columbus they came with three ships and that ship they carry prisoners and those are kind of people that columbus took to venezuela so then he finds a group of indians they take things from the natural and we all got mixed with them our genetics are very different central america so we the latins that come here are spanish people that come here we start to adopt the of the customs of here i want thanksgiving to come already because we have turkey everywhere and venezuela the only turkey when somebody gets married and when you want turkeys i hope somebody gets married so there are things that you adapt to we're living and we start to lose things of where we came from what if i go out there and the fifth of july start burning fire firecrackers and i will put artificial fire a a a spanish custom because we're we're we're burning judas because it was judas who gave up the lord you know he's a stranger so that is a catholic custom what if i did that here they'll call 911 [Music] as a latin person or spanish i can't do that here so i become adapted to your customs here because i don't want to be like the odd birds in english so there's about three latin families or spanish while the pastor is preaching you'll see us with their phone like this oh no respects and what the pastor is preaching the text it shows it it interprets for us because we want to learn english we want to know what they're saying from the pulpit sometimes you hear the phone bad and they put crazy stuff i used to i remember i used to play the flute so wanna come to this point that we were taught in the gospel in the 60s or 70s to come to a church in the message let's say if you go out there you they put christmas uh light bulbs and stuff will kill you what do you do with that and they become that's in peru nobody knows that in that hill there was a city right [Music] there was an ancient city for hundreds of years nobody knew there was a city there when they found that city [Music] [Music] and it covered it observed covering us and is covering us making us to get used to things and something that a christian didn't do in days come by and now modernism of the gospel of the message all the houses of the christians had televisions no no no christians had tvs no why because they said it was a devil's box and then it was a bad influence for the children because it made the christians cold no one had tvs [Music] let's buy a tv so we can see the movies of you jesus the time that when easter comes you can watch those movies we have in christmas oh we'll we'll listen we'll look at christmas time movies then after the tv the tv functions it works with wi-fi so we put wi-fi to the tv and the movies of the birth of jesus [Music] oh it went into the rooms even to the bathroom i've been to homes where they've had tvs in their bathroom i mean there's things that happen you can't you can't back up you have to see you have this even living yes so that television found a night found a bride found a bride and that bride is called computer and they got married and they had a son a smart tv [Laughter] and now see [Music] with a christian woman you can identify is easier to identify but a man a christian man in times past you would look at him and you would say that man is a christian he's different there was something about that individual sometimes we were the brothers at the church talking and you know what the conversations are oh it's a series that people watch like levels yeah they come by seasons seasons [Music] maybe one season brings 20 chapters and every chapter lasts one hour and so you start watching that that in on my monday and by wednesday you finished it yeah but it was five seasons yeah you saw the whole thing in one week he ate all those five seasons you asked yourself and what time of day did he pray what did he do to see one season in one day and the season of 20 hours and you take those message uh you you add those things up and you don't have the time and what time did you listen to the message or read your bible i mean it's like a lie you might think it's a lot as a joke and they think that i'm not understanding them because i don't speak the complete english but i understand and i ask myself what is this and i took a subject and the pastor after i finished preaching his head was downward and all the time he was preaching i accused myself i have fallen into those traps i like this series on facebook and also netflix that is a pastor i admired him he's coming [Music] in this final day you already read so much [Music] don't lose your step and according they're going to come and blanket us and convince us [Music] going to come and and he's going to give us the receipt how much you owe because when we don't do what he says he's going to he's going to you're going to have to pay and they can give us a voice of warning but it's happening they're men pastors ministers and that's very sad this been in my heart for two months oh we found out by the internet brother brendan had a little christmas tree and that's okay you could have your little tree and next year but you'll get something else and perhaps something else and we found out that the christmas tree comes into church and they may be behind the poop in one day so then with that little tree there comes the lights what happened here he's very kind he's very sweet he's very sweet so no one would come and tell the pastor anything and that's how the world is creeping in don't stay a step [Music] [Music] [Music] why are you losing the originality of the what you had before come up from amongst them and do not touch the unclean thing why are we accepting those things why are we becoming more modern we have to have come to limitations [Music] not that the world's creeping it but we are creeping into the world we have to be watchful oh he's too old it's antiquity never lose the original of the words to have someone here stand and speak about the people i believe that we have the same message and we have the same message revealed word for the age that we're living in and i'm very grateful [Music] god bless you god bless [Applause] you're good you're good amen well brother brandon preached some three to four hour messages and i believe we were encouraged with those testimonies to never give up on any of our loved ones any of our friends any and that we love and i i believe that we're coming more and more into the image of who we are amen and i believe that we've been warned to stay in line amen and those of you that were here last service could see the continuity to see the continuity of what god wants us to do and so we believe that we heard from the lord and may god help us to to to not get relaxed and to not allow things in the things that we have allowed in to to become the head the proper christian head of our homes to help our homes to help our lives amen but we really appreciate you coming brother and and and not stopping short of giving us the word amen um may may the lord bless you he's going to pray for our brother amen amen amen it's a lot of miles to give us this warning amen and

[Music] amen when i think of the name of the message i don't know and i think about all the people that need to know the lord it puts us in a difficult position but if we just take simply what the word says by this shall all men know where we come from and where we're going by this shall all men know that you're my disciples when you have love one for another if there's one thing if we want to overdose in is loving others and and represent christ through love you just you know what's the right thing and it's the only thing that we have and no matter if it's from venezuela puerto rico puerto
