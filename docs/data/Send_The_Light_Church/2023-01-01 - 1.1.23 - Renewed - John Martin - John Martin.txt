thoughts we strictly look to your word that declares your presence is amongst us Lord you said I'll never leave you I'll never forsake you I'll be with you even in you to the very end and we thank you for your presence today thank you for coming inside each and every one that is here today Father we just pray that you'd have the preeminence in our hearts preeminence in this service is we give it all to you in the name of Jesus Christ we pray amen amen God bless you maybe seated for just a moment we wanted to share uh some things and the first thing I want to say is happy New Years Happy New Years and it really seems like it's been a whole year and I knew we weren't going to have very many people uh I was honestly going to take out the back two roles to make you all come up um but God bless you God bless each of you for coming and those of you that stayed up late and still came I just think that's wonderful um brother Daryl had set this a quote to me uh from Brother Branham and I just I thought we could just start with this quote uh brother Brandon said so how many is glad and happy the new the Lord spared you through another year and here we are coming up to the end of the road and pray that God will forgive us of all of our sins and our shortcomings now I want to say this before I start I wish to each one of you all the most successful and Blissful and healthy New Year that I can wish to you God be with you may you grow both physically and spiritually financially and materially and everything that God can bring upon you I pray that he'll do it amen I thought that's a good place to start with amen amen well as all of you know we had uh an incident that happened in the church and it started out we believe uh that the propane uh ran out the heat stopped working and we got a pipe that bursted in two places great here and I'm so grateful what happened here even though it ruined the piano I'm glad it did happen over the equipment and the sound room because that was much more expensive uh but it did do some some damage and um I'm not sure when it happened but I'll say it had to be at least a day or probably two and maybe three I'm not sure but it was flooding real real bad and um I want to thank everyone for their prayers when we sent that text out um it's it it uh I got a call from the people who plow the driveway and saw it um this was probably Tuesday about four in the morning said that there was a some sort of problem and um well um Tuesday I had made a decision Elliot wanted to work at the shop for a couple days and make some money and so uh I didn't wake up usually I don't look at my phone till late um and so I looked at my phone saw that I thought well we're just going to stop by the church on Tuesday and shut the water off wherever it's running and go on so to our surprise we came into a huge message brother Stanton came during part of the cleanup uh and saw me up up there uh we had to tear out the insulation down the tiles uh uh and we had just a dumpster full of garbage we had to throw away um but to our surprise is when we came into this mess and I just I want to show these pictures probably just once maybe once um okay so well yeah so I don't know okay the water is is had stopped at that point uh at that picture um and and sorry that these are perfect but so that that was that's that's the mess that we had to deal with now this was Tuesday I think it's a mini miracle that we're here today oh so that so this is why we have had to get a new piano since Tuesday so so much and all this stuff look how this is the same unit right here we weren't sure whether it's door this monitor did work we had to take the one off the back and put it up here space look at that face you don't have much okay thank you for stopping that there he couldn't believe what he was seeing um this uh so this is this is the one I got because I want to make sure that every our insurance that everybody should know really what we're checking now this is Washington [Music] our heart so that's good our heart was to have brother Aaron to minister of first place they all we just had a plan but something in my heart just said you know don't announce it don't announce it I don't know why you know you just get those things but it ended up uh where obviously we had to cancel Wednesday service and it gave brother Aaron a break because he's really you know ministering so all these things were working out for the good and they there were many things working out for the good but but you you wouldn't think that there could be much good in this but there was and sister Elizabeth said um because I called brother Stan said brother stay in uh I need you to come and look at this situation and uh brother Stan's been wanting to come back to church and help and and it just been uh been a trial form but praise God before Aaron or before our brother ever came Elizabeth said well this may be for to get uh brother Stan back in church now we think boy this is uh this was a huge thing and this was natural and it didn't didn't bother me at all um but um you know because you got a problem doesn't mean you're out of the will of God and just because you're prospering doesn't mean you're in the will of God you mean job was definitely in the will the Lord look what happened to him he lost loved ones and he lost a lot and and then you have this Rich Young Ruler who couldn't separate from the love of things you you you uh you have the children of Israel as far as I'm concerned God prospered them for 40 years honestly mother needs and prospered them but yet they didn't make it so you can't look at outward things to kind of see what this is what's going on spiritually in somebody um but brother brother Stan came and uh brother Jonathan uh these two brothers came and they helped with a lot of get a lot of stuff our first day we had um the men come from our our work because they were handy they're already there I just got them over here and they started working they went to town all they went to town like they were doing it forever and I mean if you can imagine Tuesday to now I mean the chairs were washed every all the there was so much done it was non-stop hard work uh for for these days going to looking at pianos making sure is there this is the one we want for a church and so more than anything the whole thing in my heart was having getting church back in order wasn't about the money it wasn't about the insurance it wasn't about anything but everybody uh who worked on it was a tremendous help and I'm so grateful for them I'm grateful for you that prayed um and I just I've heard some testimonies that I want to get too deep into it but uh Elliot um he worked like 14 hours he didn't get to go to the shop and when I went to pay him before he'd leave he wouldn't take the money he wouldn't take anything he says if we would have worked at the shop I would let you pay me but not for not for the Lord and it really it really touched my heart but the greatest thing is there's so many ways to give God glory and it's not behind a Pulpit it's not necessarily singing or worshiping or or uh even just sharing Jesus with us and these things does give God glory but if you really really want to give God the most glory is Manifest Christ in the middle of a trial testimonies that we heard they could not believe how things were handled that it's like Elliot never seen nothing like that and you know you can either accept God's with you or begin to something's wrong and and begin to act like God isn't with you if I could say it like that when you know God is with you there is nothing to fear nothing to worry about and I think of all the things that Paul went through but he said if I'm if I'm going to Glory I'm going to glory in my infirmities I I I'd rather glory in my infirmities so that the power of God can rest upon me because you know we we kind of separate God uh in our lives uh when things are going good you know this is God when things are going bad the the the the the the carnal nature comes out and that's God is bringing us to where he's manifesting himself in our lives and I'll say it like this every time there's a trial or there's a problem use it to give God glory use it this is an opportunity and and not that I I want this to happen again not that I want trials to happen but when they're there they're precious they're opportunities to give God glory that you would never be able to give them and I'll tell you A lot of people can't do that so if you can do that see how you're sticking out like a sore thumb for God if I could say it like that you're one of his chosen because your attitude is being maintained throughout and uh there was just a a number of testimonies and we're we're grateful to the Lord for that I just I have a little testimony I I I received a text I'm just going to say it it's I I hate to call it names but it was from Brother Ferguson in this text simply said as soon as I sent my the text out when he got a chance to read it he just sat back and said what can I do to help he didn't say what's going on what happened he and what can I do to help it's a true soldier of the cross that text gave me more strength and so and so much encouragement brother even though you didn't come here you were just what can I do to help and that meant so much to me because you know being a boss and having people that work for me I I understand uh what something like that means and um and I told him I said well I got my men here now and and if I if I need anything um you know I'll I'll certainly con he was so far away and didn't want him to come but you know God was with us he supplied every need and of course we as you can see there's some some damage done here and we're going to be we're going to be working on it but I just want to I want to thank each one that that that sent a text that called that prayed that I didn't know about I'm thankful for each and every one because those prayers honestly um is what is the backbone of what what transpires our our interceding with God uh to God for in the behalf of of the needs and I'm not much for telling how big a problems we got I'm just not I'm I'm more about show me the problem I'll take care of it that's just kind of who I am and uh I want to be that way because the world's full of problems amen amen so God bless each and every one of you let's give the Lord a hand clap and praise you Jesus Hallelujah Hallelujah amen amen let's say it together and enter into the message this this morning um we want to turn to Second uh Corinthians chapter 4 for opening scripture yeah you know some had texts and just said we're praying for you and it just it just meant everything everything all right second Corinthians chapter four we're going to begin reading with verses 14 through 18. it was maybe we'll say a word of prayer first as before we begin reading Heavenly Father we thank you for watching over us Lord for truly protecting us Lord we see your hand in everything and Lord we're we want to say thank you for every trial Lord our flesh and our our outward man don't understand this thing about rejoicing in our trials but Lord we know it's the truth Thy word is truth and Lord we know things are working outside of the realm of the things that we see that Lord you have taught us to not look at the things that are seen But to look at the things that are not seen and we pray today as we look into your word Lord that we could look beyond the natural part of your word that you'd give us a spiritual ears spiritual understanding a spiritual Heart Lord that you could work with inside of us your will for our lives Lord we thank you for these things we thank you for every revelation we thank you for drawing us closer we thank you for everything now Lord we ask these things in Jesus Christ's name amen amen second Corinthians chapter 4 starting with verse number 14 knowing that he which raised up the Lord Jesus shall raise up us also by Jesus and shall present us with you for all things are for your sakes that the abundant grace might through the Thanksgiving of many rebound to the glory of God for which cause we faint not but though our outward man perish yet the inward man is renewed day by day and for our light Affliction which is but for a moment worketh for us a far more exceeding and eternal weight of Glory while we look not at the things which are seen But at the things which are not seen for the things which are seen they're temporal but the things which are not seen they're eternal amen God bless you may be seated usually when we've taken a uh a New Year's uh message we we've often talked about uh A New Beginning we've talked about that God has uh things uh special for us coming up and um we wanted to take a little bit different approach today about being renewed on a regular basis rather than just a once a year at the beginning I I I we're thankful for God bringing us through the last year and and we've all could probably testify of of the trials I heard one brother saying when he when he heard about what had happened he says I know so so seems like all the Believers I know are are going through such hard trials like Satan's like really attacking them I said well you know I I I don't know that I don't know that but I I I feel that things are not going to get better for the world and I was sharing this with brother Ferguson uh at the before Sunday school today um I don't have much hope for the world I don't think the world's going to get better which is going to uh alleviate some pressure upon us in fact it I believe the prophet said that there's going to come a squeeze on the bride so the world's obviously going to get in trouble and it's going to get pancake down and is tribulation coming but the bride is going to have a squeeze so you know trying to make things better in the temporal realm focusing everything on that and leaving all focusing on the inward man to me would be such a shame or a waste of time uh because um this the the it's gonna this world is going to be destroyed by fire and we need to be focusing on what we can do to get out of here to make a rapture because Rapture mourning when Rapture morning comes it will not matter how many times we've said I'm born again how many times I said I believe how many times what's going to matter is have are we the manifestation of Christ and that doesn't happen through a calendar year that doesn't happen with time that doesn't even happen if we our a son or daughter of God we must come under subjection to the word we must we must fit our lives to the pattern of the word and and while the world is is chasing everything the bride is chasing Christ being manifested inside and I think that's what our focus should be now God's spirit is the very source that keeps us renewed spiritually the Holy Ghost is God's life-giving Force it's the source to fill all things basically that are lacking in their life whatever would be lacking that's why the Bible says God shall supply all of our need according to his riches in Glory by Christ Jesus that's why that God is a present help in a time of need because he is the source that renews us day by day he is it's it's not us it's not in our head it's not in our mind it's not just going through the motions of reading the Bible it's not going through the motions of going to church come on how many times we go to church we feel you know like we're hardly getting anything out of it the church is not your source the Holy Ghost is your source and it's the source that satisfies the hungry and a thirsty soul it makes the believer Rejoice with joy unspeakable and full of Glory it makes this cup run over it it I'll tell you if it takes music to get you happy all the time something is wrong strange our connection is it shouldn't be with our feelings our connections should be faith in the word the Holy Ghost is God's living water it's the Fountain of Youth as it were when I came in here and the water was just coming out I mean it was just gushing I mean I believe that's the source of the Holy Ghost and God wants to give us that Source more than we want it and so the real key is changing us our attitude our mindset getting serious about the coming of the Lord and we only got a little bit of time left and that we need to start putting more effort into getting more sincere with God John 7 verse 37 Jesus said in the last days that great day of the feast Jesus stood and he cried If any man thirst let him come unto me and drink and he that believeth on me as the scriptures have set out of his belly shall flow rivers of Living Water but this fake he of the spirit which they that believe on him should receive so I'll tell you if we don't feel like like we just need a real good dose of the Holy Ghost I'm telling you it comes from the spirit of God it don't come from coming to church it comes from God now the wonderful thing about coming to church this is the only place you can go outside of your home and I'll tell you like this we try to keep the atmosphere in this church the right atmosphere sometimes we don't always do that in our homes come on sometimes we just let things go but I'll say it with the right atmosphere it creates an opportunity for us to get serious with God John 4 14 but whosoever drinketh Jesus said of the water which I shall give him shall never thirst but the water that I shall give him shall be in him a well of water bring it up into everlasting life and this is what renews US day by day I mean when we're looking at how I can change my life and how I can just be more of full of joy and more happier and how I can make it through the next year and be on top and be faithful and and do the things that I really want to do as a Christian while I'm telling you the answer is in the Holy Ghost and when you recognize it's not happening the shores inside of you needs to be unplugged something is plugging it up I'm not here to tell you don't got the Holy Ghost I'm here to tell you to serve you turn the valve on the Holy Ghost is the source that gives rest to the weary that's why they that wait upon the Lord shall renew their strength right this life-giving force is the strength for us to keep moving into 2023 because you know we all hope you got that feeling of Hope when the year starts off then it's going to be a better year it's just a feeling and it doesn't go too long before you realize you're facing the same problems and so our hope can't be in those things we have to look to the holy ghost that lives inside of us to give us strength to keep moving forward that no matter what happens I'm going through amen amen this is what gives the ability for the believer to to to run through a troop right to to run to to run over a mountain to do whatever he has to do to make it through the Bible says to endure all things to Bear all things I'll say to lay our life down as a believer for the elect's sake sometimes we just get so tired don't want to reach out well you know what the Holy Ghost isn't like that we just need the Holy Ghost into yield the Bible says we can do all things not through our ability but through Christ Jesus who strengtheneth us and you know it it's I'll tell you what the flesh says the flesh says it's too hard for me to get out of the Flesh and get into the spirit to get my strength so then we begin to rely on other people amen I get to rely on on music get to rely on other things to uh help us I want the Holy Ghost because they'll all forsake me he'll take me through he'll take me through there is not a person on the planet that is going to stand in the way or be able to put me into a Rapture won't keep me out and it won't put me in there isn't it's between us and God I am the truth as much as we love one another as much as we care about one another we need Christ and I'll say it like this I may not be and will never be uh the person that just is totally perfect in every decision in my Ministry in my delivery but I do know this that God can take anything and and help us and it's not about me and God's friends it's about you and God and if your connection with God is so good he'll make a way for you to get through so we just got to get our eyes off the flesh get our eyes off of the things that well maybe this is and this is and this and and that and what does that matter anyways what we need is the love of God in our heart the Holy Ghost that's just bubbling over and just joy and you know you just can't stop it this water is coming out so fast it was coming out the roof it was coming out the rough running down it was that pump was running I believe that's how the Holy Ghost should be but you know what turns that thing off our lust for the world and it isn't like we said oh I'm going to make a set decision I'm going to go to the bar I'm gonna drink me a fifth of whiskey is it isn't life fact it's about there just taking a second watching this or looking on the phone over here this billboard or list or some text and all of a sudden it gets you off track pose you in the wrong direction the Holy Ghost the Living Word of God is the life and power of God it's the source whereby we get renewed Jesus told us to wait in prayer till we receive power from an eye now that power was the Holy Ghost he said he said you shall receive power after the Holy Ghost is upon you and we know this we know this if the Holy Ghost fell upon any of us right now we just we'd start acting real crazy right that's the power of the Holy Ghost now that's what we want but that don't come except by you and the Lord communicating connecting abiding in Divine doing with his will I don't know what he's asked you to do but you can you can walk in the word you can walk in the light you can walk in the spirit and I'm telling you you won't be lacking I don't care what happens to you but you get away from that you just begin to rely on religion oh I do this I do that go before you know it you're just a religious person without the source of joy and we need it I took some time and I I looked on Google you know you you want to find something to go to Google right so I looked on Google for the 10 worst problems in the world today I'll say with all the problems out there in the world today we need to stay connected to God don't drift off so I'm going to read a few of them and you if you Google you'll see some similar things 10 worst problems in the world number one poverty two religious conflict and war three political polarization for government accountability fifth education six food and water Seven health and developing nations eight credit asset uh credit access can't get credit number nine discrimination and number ten physical fitness [Laughter] here's another one they that they're they're the same in the first one poverty is number one number two climate change number three disease number four war and terrorism five pollution number six is animal abuse seven drug abuse they put animal abuse before drug abuse number eight racism number nine global warming and number 10 population con growth I looked at the United Nations list and they said biodiversity loss is number one climate change is number two destructive artificial intelligence is number three number four is environmental disaster number five is nuclear Holocaust then pandemic then biotechnology risk and finally molecular nano technology there is tons of problems in the world life is full of problems that's why we need to stay connected to God but I'll say in this list that I read I don't see anything in here that's any concern about the soul of a human being not a one of them Jesus knew the world was full of problems he even prophesied of a tribulation come in the last days that would be not as ever was upon the face of the Earth or never will be and he told us despite the problems that they're going to be he said be ready despite all the problems be ready be ready for my coming put the emphasis there I wonder how many people in the world are concerned about that Jesus said in John chapter 17 verse 14 if you have your Bible you want to turn there John chapter 17 verse 14. praise the Lord I have given them Thy Word and the world have hated them now here's the reason because they are not of the world even as I am not of the world there is a definite separation here in the human in in the human in human beings Summer of the world and some are not and he's praying he says I pray not that thou shouldest take them out of the world but that thou shouldest keep them from the evil showing where the emphasis here is not not take them out of these bad situations but fill them so full of the Holy Ghost that they're kept from the evil that's in the world we need the Holy Ghost they are not of the world even as I am not of the world he said sanctify them through thy truth Thy word is truth this is why we need the Living Word of God not just come and hear the word preach and say amen I agree with that amen I know that amen I've heard that but amen so be it in me Lord let it live in me let it sanctify me the word has to change us The Living Word that's how we're renewed day by day as thou has sent me into the world he's praying to the father even so have I also sent them into the world wow so here's the Holy Ghost inside of us leading us into the world that's full of troubles and problems and that you're not going to bring any uh order you're not going to get the government in order you're not going to take care of all the corruption that's in the government it's just not going to happen but but the but God sends us with the power of the Holy Ghost into the world to represent him all right to represent them to be a light to pull out the few that are predestinated we don't know who they are but that's the commission that we're on to the spiritual believer now that's why brother bran said that mission work was always in the will of the Lord and I'll tell you a mission work could be next door indoor in your church in your community it could be wherever you could be a light to somebody is always the will of God too often the Christians nowaday brother Brandon said they're soft they just want to come in sit down don't want to get their hands dirty want to just go to church be fed and leave and I'll tell you that ain't what Jesus did to his disciples he sent them into the world not to mingle in in just fall for the things of the world but to be a light to those that are caught up in the world first John chapter 2 verse 15 very familiar scripture John said love not the world neither the things that are in the world for If any man love the world the love of the father is not him now that's kind of scary because how many times that we really really really really really are liking something and you know I we just got to make sure we're not liking it too much you know what I'm saying because you know we're here we're here we've got to do things and but we can't use the excuse of it's okay all the time we just can't what about a little 11 11 the whole lump what about maybe that was good for a time but God's drawing me closer amen amen so that it's an individual Affair and we want to make sure that we're doing everything we can to give God an opportunity to convict us if that's what we need are you with me I'd like to say I'm not perfect I got a quote at the end I want to read I could just I just I'm amen and brother Branham for all that is in the world and the lust of the Flesh and the lust of the eyes and the pride of life is not of the father but it's of the world and the world's going to pass away in the lust era but he that doeth the will of God he abideth forever so in the midst of all this crazy stuff that's going on yes it may be I'm not saying it's not good to to to to help the those that are are are poor poverty and Jesus even said the poor you have with you always and I I'm sure it's going to be like that until the Lord returns but even Jesus didn't try making Lazarus a businessman he did it but we need to be about the father's business about his will and you know in order to do that you got to really seek him you've got to really get humble you got to really get load broken before the Lord because if you're expecting God just to send you some email send you some outward way you know we're going to miss it a lot of times we're not doing much for the Lord because we're saying well God didn't tell me what do you mean God didn't tell you how do you know how do you know not praise God for those that are seeking the will of the Lord because you will find it I always remember brother hankin said if you really really really really really want the will of God you got it but if it's just like well I only want if I if not going to be hard on my flash you know then then you really really don't want it and I I just heard a uh a sister was sharing with me yesterday how she's seeking the will the Lord unmanned it says that's that's the right thing to be doing when you really really are seeking the will of God you got to pray and desire it and want it and wait on the Lord but they're so often that we're not doing that and we're just waiting for God to just come knock on the door when it could be just a still small voice can you say Amen to that amen now Jesus had been falsely accused and he was delivered into the highest ranking government of that time and it was so out of order right because they they wanted Jesus to come and just destroy all those Romans who are treating them bad right but this is how Jesus responded in John 18 verse 36 he said my kingdom is not of this world if my kingdom were of this world then would my servants fight that I should not be delivered into the to the Jews but now is my kingdom not from hands whoa was he sending us a message um if we were for down here yeah then I'd get my guys and we'd get a sword and we'd start taking taking care of you Romans you know we could sit here for days and days and days and talk about all the problems in our government in in our community in our school boards and everywhere that we're kind of associated with we could even walk into a restaurant and want to talk to the manager because things ain't right come on but our kingdom isn't from down here we should be fighting the right battles not the wrong battles we're all fighting something that's right we're on some kind of battle he's got to make sure we're fighting the right battle we should be fighting the good fight of Faith the lay hold of each other oh brother John I already got it you've already got it um well if you had it then you would be living for others that's right because that's what eternal life is so if you're not living for others the way that you know the prophet taught then you should be laying hold of it be laying a hold of eternal life because it's too easy to say well I'm saved I got it what else I need to do that's to say that's all that is is Satan trying to get you to lay down your sword lay it down so you don't have to do nothing you're still you know connected with God everything's okay before you know it you begin to lose your joy your peace Your Love God wants us to put on the whole armor of God and and be about the father's business don't wait for me to say to you this is what you should be doing I'm sorry I believe it's more intimate than God having to tell me something about you it's not between me you and God that's right it's not between some preacher and you and God it's between you and God and if you don't got confidence that God could speak to you then spend time in prayer and he you will hear his voice they that wait upon the Lord shall renew their strengths the Bible says my sheep hear my voice you follow me I think the thing is we're listening to the wrong voices we're drifting off can you imagine where we'd be without Church bad I love what I was talking to our sister yesterday and she said I thought this has been too long since I've been out of church I do not want to go back to not having a church what it does Church helps hold accountability do we like countability no no we don't but it helps us we need it we need it whether it's the world's problems or natural problems are in life we we understand that they're just temporal and we need to look to the things that are Eternal is that what the scripture says now here are the top 10 resolutions for 2023 I want to know if any of yours are in here number one eat healthier exercise more number two number three take a social media break number four start budgeting especially how things are going out there clean out your living space all these you know really neat I need to be doing by the way [Laughter] try something new become more responsible become more organized set a time set aside time for yourself get rid of a toxic trait now this is on the internet this is like the top 10 resolutions for 2023 and I don't know what holiday went about getting this how many people they talk to but again none of these problems are addressing a changed nature none of them are and we need we need that nature change in order to see the Kingdom right Jesus unless you're born again we cannot see the kingdom of God and I think as as that nature changes inside of us we begin to see the kingdom more clearly and we'll never make a Rapture unless we're without spot or wrinkle he's coming for a bride without spotter wrinkle that's what he said and and when brother Bram had that vision of the Bride when she got online when she heard the word get back in line she got back in line that means the bride can get online but eventually we know ultimately that bribe will not be deceived at the end but between now and then you know she's getting tripped up that's why we need the word that's why we need the revelation of the word that's why we need to to to have a balance in the word he's coming he's coming soon amen despite all the problems in the world the biggest problem that each one of us has you know we got the same problem it's ourself brother Brian said we are a greatest enemy and that is our biggest problem our carnal nature is constantly standing in the way and keeping us from what getting ready it's keeping us from getting ready we've got time to get ready we've got the word we've got the message it's at on everybody's phone we got opportunity to come to church and pray and with one another and and dig into Christ and and and just draw an eye to God he'll draw an at you we've got that it's right in front of us but what's missing ourself we listen to the devil way too much telling us that we're already ready we got saved we got baptized we're ready I've been told by this message I'm the bride I'm in need of nothing we get caught up in a little to see a spirit of self-building now I'm just going to go work on my life things I want to do out here in life instead of building self-denial building self-crucifixion building getting this old man crucified so the inward man can be renewed day by day that's what's missing now despite all the problems in the world we're still not from this world and if we were we would fight but Jesus didn't send a prophet in this age to tell us to fight for the things of the world now I know that this word is not hitting everybody but it's the word and it needs to be preached amen there's just too much going on we're so interested in the world that we forget about the souls of men and women I believe trust me I believe in predestination I fail the Lord so much that if we didn't have that to tie on to right the devil could easily take us yeah yeah and sipped us like wheat yeah yeah but uh but here's here's the thing I cannot remain the same I cannot remain the same if I remain the same just like I am I am not going in a rapture I've got to become like him I gotta manifest Christ has got to be manifested in my body let me say it like that not me manifest Christ but Christ needs to manifest himself in me that's what he's coming for now that's only going to happen by me dying out to my will and having him live out his will inside of me fighting to prove things are wrong in the world is not what our spiritual forefathers did it's not what Jesus did that what our spiritual forefathers did in the Bible you know Paul wasn't ramping up against the Romans in fact when he was in trouble with the Romans he tried converting them said I would let you all like me yeah that's what he said so it's not proving that the government's wrong even our natural forefathers First Amendment states that the government could not make a law against the freedom of religion we have something so precious it wasn't way down on the list and here we come and we do not appreciate the freedom that we have to worship God I'll worship God when I feel like I'll worship God when you know you make me feel good God when you supply on my knees then I'm going to worship you right no we have a freedom to give God glory to serve them to the best of our ability can you imagine living in a nation you can't go to somebody and share Jesus with them all right gotta hide all the time over here we don't have to hide we're not doing it What's missing I know our government's corrupt everybody knows our government's corrupt yeah look it turned down the message what in 57 what do you expect's going to happen in 2022 what do you expect's going to happen right it's not going to repent we miles are just do what God told us to do go win a soul go win assault pray God put a soul on my heart help me to share Jesus with somebody despite all the problems in the world the biggest problem remains today and always will be us dying out to our will if we are the kingdom of God we can't rely on just what Jesus did for us now understand this I believe in Calvary and without Calvary we wouldn't have a chance without the blood of Christ we would have a chance but we cannot rely on that alone to get us out of here what do you mean brother John what I mean is that blood that was shed at Calvary it has to be applied to your life it has to be applied to your spirit and to your soul amen it has to bring forth the Life of Christ out of your body that life has to come back unto the believer and that believer is changed from Glory unto Glory he's changed a little bit here a little there a little and he begins to build the Statue of a perfect man which is Christ inside of us we can't just rely on what Christ did for us we we've got to do his will and his will is for us to surrender to his will I'll tell you if I was sitting in the up here and somebody said that I'd be jumping up and down saying amen praise the Lord that's how I feel it's how I feel I don't believe in works but I believe in submission to the word of God that will produce works I think it's fine if you want to work on some new year's resolution I don't think there's anything wrong with that but we need to get deadly serious about making ourselves ready for a Rapture and that I think is kind of like fading away it's like a you know somewhere off and further down in the calendar somewhere another month than what we're looking at and this thing was raining down water I could I just forget about that I'm just going to cut well I'm gonna I'll shut the water off maybe and just order to have church on Wednesday anyways and and just no it had to be dealt with yeah it had to be dealt with and we got to deal with this old man who just keeps wanting to do his own thing and have his own way Lord help us now Jesus prayed not that we should be taken out of the world but that we should what become one with him that's what the prayer was to become one with him it's through the process of sanctification that we become one with him he said sanctify them through thy truth Thy word is true so when you're hearing the word of God whether you're reading the Bible whether you're listening to a tape reading a message coming to church hearing or you're in your prayer closet and the Holy Ghost speaks to you that is his word and when you obey that word you receive that word your life becomes sanctified the Bible says we are Washed by the watering of the word it's a process and I'll say it like this we need to we need it every day we can't just well I I was through I was going through the process of sanctification 12 years ago and I made it through I got the Holy Ghost and now I don't even listen to that message anymore I mean there was a reason Jesus got his disciples and he started washing all their feet all right and and it's not the you know the colonel Minds as well you know I don't I don't need to be Sanctified or it's like oh I guess I never got saved I need to be Sanctified like Peter did one in his whole body to be washed he said that's not a need it's just your feet it's what you got involved with that's why the Bible says wash your hands she sinners the bride is serious about getting out of here yes the foolish virgin is not and that Spirit comes into the church and it's just a lukewarm thing you don't need to say Amen to the word just kind of like lay back and let him get through this you know Jonathan he must or John Jonathan must add some hot peppers must be excited must be no no look I'm responsible for you I and myself can't do anything but I know if I give you this word God will take that word and he will work in your heart and if that don't work nothing could work nothing can work but we need the word to become one with him and we when we receive the truth the real truth not just to our head not a head knowledge but we receive it into a heart say Lord that word that was for me I want that I want to I'm going to go home and I'm gonna start putting that into practice you will become more one with Christ that Oneness and that Union will begin to develop and before you know it you know what you'll be you'll be just like Jesus imagine Jesus sitting here in church with us today and he doesn't want anything to do with that person or he doesn't want to shake that hand that person's hand or he's going to sit over here on the seat of the scornful and start judging or he's going to sit there and say you know you need to make me feel good right sorry Jesus wouldn't do that okay and Jesus amen Jesus in you is going to do the same thing that Jesus would do and that's what I love about the Holy Ghost there's no walls there's no favorites there's no respect persons it's not going to read is not going to dislike me just because of this outfit may pray for me but you're you're not gonna see we have this carnality of trying to be spiritual but in a very religious carnal way when all you got to do is let the Holy Ghost in be renewed day by day do you without respect to persons you just love everybody you care about everybody you'll lay down your life for anybody because you're living for others my my my I don't know what time I I started do you remember after I got done does anybody remember so nobody knows the time I'm off the hook I'm off the hook so I want to know all right let's go back to our opening scripture because I'm going to start now second Corinthians chapter four I want to start with verse seven just get a uh a little bit of a a background here says but we have this treasure this Holy Ghost and Earth and vessels that the Excellency of the power may be of God and not of us see where that power comes from and and look with this power we are troubled on every side I mean the waters come down out of the ceiling we are perplexed but not uh in despair persecuted but not forsaken cast down but not destroyed we're always bearing about in our body the dying of the Lord that the life also of Jesus might be made manifest in our body how can the Lord be dying inside of us how does that happen I thought he just died once at Calvary how does the Lord die inside of us the Lord we bear the the death of Christ inside of us when we do what he did in the garden when when we say Lord not my will but thine be done and it's not when you know oh man I just don't feel like getting up and going to church it isn't like that it's when he calls you to do the hardest thing that you could possibly do because if you can do that you can do anything yeah you can do anything you can get up and go to church you can uh sacrifice a Saturday to go help somebody you can't take time off to go win a soul because you're burying in your body the dying of the Lord Jesus that what's the purpose of that brother John that the life also of Jesus might be made manifest in our body well brother John I think I can manifest Christ in my life without having to do that no you can't you you can become a religious alcoholic a religious bum but it takes if we don't die out we'll never manifest Christ for we which live are always always look at that for we which are we which live are always delivered unto the death for Jesus sake that the life also of Jesus might be made manifest in our mortal body see we don't wait till we get to the other side so then death Works in US but life in you in other words when death is truly working in us we're not trying to make our life better it's for others life is going to work in in somebody else we having the same Spirit of Faith according to this is written I believe and therefore have I spoken we also believe in therefore speak knowing that he which raised up the Lord Jesus shall raise us up also by Jesus and shall present us with you for all things are for your sakes that the abundant grace might through the Thanksgiving of many rebound to the glory of God I love that if you're in a room imagine you're in a stadium anybody ever been to the promise Keepers all right all right imagine being there in a stadium now and you're the only one that stands up and says glory to God you're going to feel but imagine being in that stadium and everybody stands up and says go praise the Lord all sudden you feel like you're among angels and I believe that's how church should be one thing we got in common is we love the Lord Jesus Christ and he's worthy of all praise amen for which cause we faint not no matter what happens to us we faint not but though our outward man perish we can't get rid of it yet the inward man is renewed day by day oh that is so precious to me let this old man can't do what it wants get what I want that's okay the inward man is renewed day by day let's have our New Year's every day let's not just hey this is our New Year's resolution let let us be renewed day by day let's come in a week from now and be more on fire for Jesus Christ than we are today and let the month of February be better than January and let's let's do what the scripture is telling us to do he says for our light Affliction what is that light Affliction that light of fiction is us having to crucify our will to take the the lust and the desires and everything that it wants to do fight to hold that man accountable and that's right knock him down say I'm not you're not going to have your way in in my thoughts and in my mind I'm casting down all reasoning and everything that exalts itself against the will of God and bring it into captivity bring it into captivity see you're fighting we're all fighting we must fight the right fight for our light Affliction which is but for a moment it works for us a far more exceeding and look eternal weight of Glory no I it may not make me more money I trusted too how far is trusted two going to take us it won't take us in the first step of the rapture we need Jesus for that so what's the advice that we're giving here while we look not at the things which are seen but at the things which are not seen for the things that are seen are temporal this light Affliction is temporal but the things which are not seen are Eternal that's why we come to church we come to church for the eternal not for the Natural Things although I believe we need more faith for more healings for more deliverances for for as the prophet said prosperity uh material what I believe that God wants us to prosper in all things as our soul prospers we've got to put the priority for seek ye first the kingdom of God and his righteousness The Living Word when we become renewed day by day it is that it is that that helps us to walk in the spirit it helps us to stay on our knees and pray through without the victory from yesterday we have it's harder to build the next day you know what I'm saying you just I don't feel like doing that you go sin you do something wrong it doesn't make you want to get up and try harder the next day you feel defeated in yourself so just you know Naturally Speaking you you build your faith naturally you want more self-esteem start doing esteemable things and you build self-esteem that's how that works now spiritually you build today you you apply your faith to just I don't it's not how I feel it's not what I want to do but God wants me to read I'm going to read I'm going to pray I'm going to put into action what he speaks to my heart you take that you do that now you got faith for tomorrow to build more and that's how you build in Christ that's how you build in a church but having this lazy feeling Nevada I'm just gonna let everybody else do it no before you know it you're going to have conflict in your home because everybody needs to be doing their part right now Jesus Christ is the Living Word he's the same yesterday today and forever he will renew us and he will change our nature now we must adjust our attitude back to the word and stop insulting God about how we feel are you with me because our feelings kind of dictate to us right we turn what we want to turn on TV we listen to what we want to listen to we eat what we want to eat because it all has to do with us it's what we want but when it comes to God we just do what he says regardless of what we what our taste buds are so we need to adjust our attitude back to the word we need to adjust our faith back to the word not wait till something happens to say oh yes I believe we need to renew the inward man day by day and this will get rid of our 10 worst problems that's keeping us from reaching the bride's goal of a rapture and you want to know what those 10 worst problems are in our life I'm going to read them to you number one ourselves number two who knows number two ourselves did you look at my notes number three ourselves I hope we're getting the picture the 10 worst problems I'm not trying to be insensitive to the problems that are in the world and making light of them but you know imagine I could fix and this can't happen but if I could fix all the problems in the world and make all the governments true blue and all the crimes that were judged right and the right people were in prison and and not the wrong people and and everything was right I could fix all the problems but I never fixed me that's right I would never make a rapture that's how important it is to take care of the number one problem fix ourself once you fix yourself you got a better chance of helping another you believe that it's good to trust in the blood but if you deny If you deny coming under subjection to the word it won't do you any good so we need the blood but we need we need what we need what the blood did for us it brought us back to Christ to the word and to go ahead and cherry pick out of the word what you believe what you're going to say Amen to what what you want what you're going to follow and call that a believer that's that's not that's not a Christ believer that's a different that's a different gospel so we we need the blood but we also need to come under subjection to the blood or else what we're doing is crucifying the Lord afresh now do I have just a couple more minutes all right Titus Chapter 3 Verse one now if you didn't like that you just talked to brother Ryan after the service okay because I only needed one amen for that one all right Titus Chapter 3 Verse one put them in mind to be subject to principalities and powers to obey magistrates and to be ready to every good work who's ready to every good work if you want to know if you're ready to be uh to every good work you know if you are if your attitude is ready if your attitude is ready you'll be ready when your attitude is ready you're ready to speak now look at these words speak evil of no man take about just take a look at the the things that you've said in the last two weeks can you find any evil that you spoke all right all right this is a good work to speak evil of nowhere to be no Brawlers don't brawl your way around don't push your way around but look here's a good work be gentle showing all meekness unto your favorite people yeah I just I just don't get this partiality show all meekness unto all men if your best friend if you hang out with somebody that all they think about is themselves that's going to affect your life you hang out with Jesus who's living for others all the time that's going to affect your life and now what I love about this word is despite what anybody thinks about God this is God these scriptures testify who he is showing all meekness unto all men for we ourselves also were sometimes foolish can you say amen amen disobedient deceived serving divers lust and Pleasures living in Malice and Envy in Haiti hateful and hating one another for we ourselves also we're so we should be able to relate to the scripture but after the kindness after that the kindness and the love of our uh the love of God our savior toward men appeared not by anything we did not by works of righteousness we have done but according to them his Mercy he saved us by the washing of regeneration that means rebirth by the washing of the rebirth by the renewing renovation of the Holy Ghost now what we did Brother Stan he helped renovate this this week this second half of the week by the way he renovated it he took it from what it was to what it is that's what the Holy Ghost does to us takes us this corruption that happens washes us and he changes us and he makes us a new creature he renews us day by day and the more we can get in sync with that that God is this is really what's on God's mind that he really wants to change us and we if we could just let go of that I don't need it let that goal and say I need it I need this I need it then you'll see a greater change but it has to go through free more agency it has to that word I'll renovate it means to repair or to improve something so the renewing of the Holy Ghost it is repairing or it's improving something so we should have a little sign up sheet in the back before you come into church and it states what you need what you need to repaired what you what you have need of spiritually it needs to be on there I'm not saying we really need that but that's when we come to get the word that there should be something in our heart that we're hungering for for God to change like I don't like what this was happening in my life this week and I I really want to overcome this situation I really want to have more wisdom how to handle this type of a problem that's what the the Holy Ghost does it it takes and it gives us the character that we need all right let's read this and we got to quickly go which he shed on us abundantly through Jesus Our Savior Jesus Christ Our Savior that being justified by his grace we should be made heirs according to the hope of eternal life this is a faithful Saiyan and these things I will that thou affirm affirm affirm constantly whoa we got to pay attention to this that they which have believed in God how many believe in God here that they which have believed in God might be careful that word careful means to exercise your thought be careful to maintain good works these things are good and profitable unto all men praise the Lord don't try to sneak out without good works if you believe he that believeth on me the works I do shall he do also they follow you got to maintain them all right I just got one scripture and you can write it down if you want it's Psalms I got more scriptures but one scripture I want to I want to hear it's Psalms 51 verses 9 through 13. and I'll in this scripture we know this the story here what happened to David but I want to say this sometimes it takes a deep humbling and a deep Brokenness to be renewed with God you know sometimes our heart our hearts become hardened we become calloused it's hard to break through and it's no fault of God and I want to say it like this it's not even the fault of another brother or sister it's not the fault of this world because I will tell you God will never put anything on you that you can't bear but if you don't choose the right decision if you don't choose to forgive if you don't choose to let go if you don't choose to move forward here's no other option but to get a hard heart and when you get a hard heart what will happen is you will not be able to grow in Christ you're just stunt your growth right there until you decide to Let It Go so these things come upon as they come in our lives that we may grow into more of the image of Christ it's not the knowledge of Christ the knowledge of Christ is going to do only it's only going to kill me destroy me what I need is the life living out of me that's going to bring forth life Psalms 51 verse 9 says hide thy hide thy face from my sin and blot out all my iniquities creating me a clean heart o God and renew a right Spirit Within Me cast me not away from thy presence and take not thy Holy Spirit from me restore unto me the joy of my thy salvation and uphold me with thy free spirit then will I teach transgressors thy ways and sinners shall be converted unto thee noticed he didn't say yeah you know you restore my joy do these things you know I'll be a better Christian I'll stay out of trouble he didn't say that he's talking about doing good works I will teach transgressors there are ways I'm going to get out there and get my hands dirty and tell them that what they're doing they shouldn't be doing and sinners are going to get converted because you didn't take your Holy Spirit Away From Me there was just heaviness in this Brokenness verse 17 the sacrifices of God are a broken spirit a broken and contrite heart oh God thou will not despise do you love the word sometimes it takes this this setting to get us renewed with God and no maybe none of us have done anything that that that David did here but it's a little foxes that spoil the vine yeah and and if we're not getting where we want to get to we just got to dig deeper and and God's God's not going to share his glory with anyone he just wants it to be you and him amen let's stand together thank you for your patience your time I want to read this uh last uh quote from brother Brandon and uh the the first one I read brother Daryl sent it to me and this one brother Gideon sent to me and it was from the contest I'm reading a little bit more than what he sent me uh he sent me this first part and now beginning the new year I want to say not happy New Year to you I want to say this to you God bless you and if he does that that's all you'll have need of for the coming year and I trust that he will that's what brother Gideon sent me but I wanted to read the next paragraph that brother bran said after this he said and I'm by his grace we're going to try this year he will spare me and spare you by his grace and I hope I'm a better Pastor next year than I have been this year hope I be a better servant to Christ I'll try hard to try to live closer more truer to bring the message just as he gives it me I shall bring it to you the best I can withhold nothing that he would want me to give to you I'll do all that I know how and I know you feel the same way you feel like that we all want to work together now for the evening lights are certainly getting dim and the Sun uh far setting the Earth's coming off we we know that spiritually speaking the church is cooling off and the Revival is over we don't know what's comes next but we will trust God for that whatever it is n't that beautiful I think that's a perfect quote for us here in our in our church amen let's just sing creating me a clean heart and just it's an opportunity to just draw closer to God Amen we'll have to get used to the new piano sound and created in me a clean heart oh God and renew a right Spirit Within Me creating me a clean heart [Music]
