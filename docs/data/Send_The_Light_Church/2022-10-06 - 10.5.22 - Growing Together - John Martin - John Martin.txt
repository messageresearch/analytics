these things in Jesus Christ's name amen amen God bless you may be seated how many has spent uh any time in Pursuit of perfect love since last service amen praise the Lord that's so beautiful how many has actually um laid some things down amen wonderful and I'll just say even though that message is has owed and gone by don't let the instructions or what the prophet told us go by let's let's continue to pursue it amen well um our subject is going to be kind of growing with the tares [Laughter] growing with the tears I know it's a little bit different but you know we can have some differences with one another in in in in in the church and we want to know how to to to deal with these things and how we should where we need to stand and and um I believe that this this service here is going to help us let's turn to Matthew chapter 13. Matthew Chapter 13 and read the the parable of the terrors are you are you okay with this okay it's in the Bible [Laughter] Matthew 13 starting with verse number 24 another Parable put he forth unto them saying the Kingdom of Heaven is likened unto a man which sold good seed in his field but while men slept the enemy came and sowed tares among the wheat and went his way but when the blade was sprung up and brought forth fruit then appeared the tares also the Servants of the householder came and said unto him sir did us not thou sow good seed in the field from whence then have it tears he said unto them an enemy has done this the servants responded will thou then that we go and gather them up and he said nay last while ye gather up the tares you root up also the wheat with them let both grow together until the Harvest and in the time of harvest I will say to the Reapers gather thee together first the tares and bind them in bundles to burn them but gather the wheat into my barn um now what are these two seeds but back in August we ministered on the two seeds of Abraham one was a spiritual seed one was a natural seed and tonight we want to learn from Jesus here about growing together and the one seed is a spiritual seed and that is the seed of God it was planted by God through the spoken word he spoke the word and the seed came forth and it was planted just like he spoke everything else into existence the Earth the Stars everything was spoken by him and he is still speaking into existence he's still alive he's still making all things new amen now Genesis tells us that every seed will bring forth of its own kind in order for God's seed to come forth it must be born again the only way that God's seed is going to come forth is to be born again because it wasn't born properly to begin with as we don't have time to talk about that but we just know that we were born uh in a corruptable nature the first nature around that seed it must die in order for the new life to come forth we just can't bring forth the new life with the old the first nature must die out before the new nature comes forth amen all things are passed away behold all things are become new and all things are of God so this is that seed that he planted he planted a good seed fact everything that God ever created was good and if you think about it say when he was created he was good hard to think about that right now but he was at one time in John chapter 3 verse 3 says Jesus answered and said unto them verily verily I say unto you except a man be born again he cannot see the kingdom of God so the good seed that's been sown it must be born again it can't it's not just going to develop on its own there's a process that has to happen amen a complete conversion now the other seed is a natural seed and it was planted by the Devil Without the spoken word of God or without the will of God now since the devil can't create life eternal life the only way that he could plant the seed is to perversion he took something that was already perfect and he perverted it Satan was able to convince man to take control of his own will and this is what's really important here because that's not how God created man in the beginning right he didn't create him to here's your will go do what you want but Satan offered a way that man could take control of his own Direction in life and he he brought forth uh a nature that you can determine your own discretion what you want to do where you want to go right in other words the control of your own seed that's what uh the most subtle Beast to the anointing of Satan got Eve to do was to take control of her own seed that she could bring forth her own seed by her will didn't need to wait for God didn't need to get any okay just do what you want to do and it's really the devil's discretion even though man thinks it's his own discretion true it just shows the unity between man and the devil an unconverted soul now this natural seed planted by the devil never becomes born again it may go through what looks like the stages of the new birth but the outs from the outside appearance in other words things may seem a church goer may even get baptized but all things don't become new and all things don't become of God so therefore it cannot be the seed of God right because we're just talking about two seeds no the the nature of the seed never ends up changing this we're talking about the two seeds that were sold one is spiritual one is natural the one that's spiritual it changes amen the one that's natural it doesn't change the nature inside never dies out so it remains a natural seed did you notice in this Parable why the enemy he couldn't just get his own land and sow his own seed well first of all the devil can't create right so he couldn't create a planet to put the seed in he couldn't create a sun to warm the seed he couldn't create water to give it moisture so he had to use he had to steal he didn't even ask God he just went and planted the seed the only thing the devil can create is a bad atmosphere a bad attitude and I don't care attitude so what does he do he uses God the ground was already prepared for seed the sun was already shining the moisture was available Satan just uses God to bring forth his own seed and you know what God just allows it Matthew 5 verse 45 Matthew 5 45 God maketh his son to rise unto evil and under good and sendeth Reign on the just and the unjust so God knows about this situation right right this is a a very important point and it takes the presence of God to bring forth both seeds remember that amen it takes the presence of God to bring forth both seeds take son takes the moisture and it brings forth both seeds it God is the only Giver of Life I don't care what seed you plant in the Earth in your garden the sun and the water will bring forth that seed no matter what the seed is what we need to roll plants is what we need to get a harvest brother Brandon said in the message Corinthians book of correction he said in the Holy Spirit kept speaking to me about that what is that I read it over and over and it was in the book of uh Hebrews and then a vision come and I saw the world standing before me turning it was all diced up and light plowed and ready for to plant and there went a man by in white sowing seeds and after he went around cultivating the Earth another man come in Black sowing seeds behind him and when the seeds that the good man sold come up was wheat and the bad the black men sold the seeds come up that was dressed in black it come up and it was Weeds and oh one was contrary to the other right and a great drought come in the vision and the little wheat bowed his head and it was just so thirsty for the for a drink and the weed bowed its head and it was thirsty for a drink and then a great Cloud came over and the rains come down and the little wheat raised up and began to scream praise the Lord praise the Lord it was so happy to get water amen and the little weed raised up and began to holler praise the Lord praise the Lord for the same water then I understood see there it is the holy spirit will fall but by their fruits you shall know them said the Lord Jesus not by the not by the reaction of the spirit whether they heal the sick or whether they speak with tongues or whether they sing in the spirit or whether they Rejoice this way or that way they can do all that and still be lost right it's your life within you a born-again experience we must be born again we cannot get to where we're wanting to without the nature change and it's something that we just got to be serious about and and God doesn't gift it and as we understand gifts right you got a hunger you got a thirst you got to be willing to die out you got to say God I want this more than anything yeah now Jesus tells about the meaning of the parable starting in uh verse 36 of Matthew 13 verse 36 then Jesus sent the multitude away and went into the house and his disciples came in unto him saying declare unto us the parable of the Terrors of the field and he answered and said unto them he that sold soweth the good seed is the son of man and the field is the world the good seed are the children of the Kingdom but the tares are the children of the wicked one the enemy that sold them is the devil the Harvest is the end of the world the reaper the reapers are the Angels as therefore the tares are gathered and burned in the fire so shall it be in the end of this world the son of man shall send forth his angels and they Shall Gather out of his kingdom all things that offend in them which do iniquity and shall cast them into the furnace of fire there shall be wailing and gnashing of teeth then shall the righteous shine forth as the sun in the Kingdom of their father who have ears to hear Let Him hear so obviously everybody doesn't have ears to hear and that's why Jesus said actually he said that in every Church age for the last 2000 years and he that have ears to hear Let Him hear Jesus wants us to hear the truth he doesn't want us to have itching hears itching ears just wanting to hear it the way you want to hear to hear the type of message you want to have to hear the the type of preaching that you want you know we if we all wanted if we were all in charge of what we wanted the church what kind of preaching it would be it would all be different it would all be different because we all got different taste but we've got to trust the Lord God can use anybody to help anybody and it if we take that out of God's hand and say I cannot be helped because of this this this or that we're limiting God because God can do anything he can use anybody so we just must have confidence in hearing from God when we come to church to hear what the spirit is saying to the church now before we get into the nature of these seeds uh two different Sowers sold their own seeds and they had their own purpose and intention for sowing the seed I want to talk about this what was the purpose of planting their seeds well they both wanted a Harvest Right they wanted the fruit from the Harvest so let's take a look at God's purpose for planting the seed let's start with him first or Colossians chapter 1 verse 16 says all things were created by Him and for him so we see right here the reason he planted his seed was for him he did not plan it for somebody else right I think my wife was telling me that she planted some sort of hot peppers jalapeno peppers and she gave them away to our sister Tasha here and I said did you say one I kind of wanted one I didn't save any I didn't plant them for me she said but God planted the seeds for him in Revelations chapter 4 verse 5 and the four beasts had each of them six wings about them and they were full of eyes within and the rest and they rest not day and night saying holy holy holy Lord God Almighty which was which is and which is to come and when those beasts give glory and honor and thanks to him that set upon the throne who liveth forever and ever the four look at something else happened then Four and Twenty Elders fell down before him that sat on the throne and they worshiped him that liveth forever and ever and they cast their crowns Before the Throne saying Thou Art Worthy O Lord to receive glory and honor and power for thou has created all things and for thy pleasure they are and were created amen now if he created the Heavenly Host to praise him to worship him to give him honor and power and to give them everything don't you think the seeds that he planted ought to be doing the same thing amen amen Revelations 5 verse 11. and I beheld and heard the voice of many angels round about The Throne of the Beast and the elders and the number of them was 10 000 times 10 000 and thousands of thousands now we're getting into lots of people here saying with a loud voice Worthy is the land that was slain to receive power and riches and wisdom and strength and honor and glory and blessings and every creature which is in heaven and on the earth and under the Earth and such as are in the sea and all that are in them heard I sane blessing and honor and glory and power be unto him that saith on the throne and unto the lamb forever and ever and the four be said amen and the 420 Elders fell down and worshiped him that liveth forever and ever I just can't imagine us going to heaven the seed of God and kind of sitting around and going what's going on hey what'd you hear about the news going on we were created to bring God our honor to bring him pleasure his seed is going to grow to bring pleasure to to his creator this is the sea that God has planted this is a a man a woman that's been born again he's things are no longer of his life but all things are of God Amen no the seed of God was planted by God to bring forth Glory unto God with our lives with our whole lives to give him our strength our power our might our time our abilities to increase his kingdom there's a purpose there the seed of God was planted by God to honor his name amen amen by doing all that we do in the name of the Lord Jesus and we were planted by God to worship Him in spirit and in truth amen I'm sorry we were not planted for any other reasons to let our just like the Four and Twenty elders just like the Beast to let our will fall down to his will amen and let his will be done in our lives that's the kind of worship that he's looking for we were planted by God himself to bring forth pleasure unto him it's no longer just do what you want Thursday Friday Saturday Sunday is coming up oh yeah or Wednesday nights coming up no it's our whole life it's a it's a change you know when I first I went to a church like I grew up going to a church but I'll tell you when I met the truth in brother Johnson's Church everything changed every single thing changed and the things that did not change they were supposed to um eventually they've got to change they just got to we've we're going to become completely new creatures that should just make us so excited so happy so excited amen God can do it amen God can do it if the everything that you need to become all that you're to be to bring in pleasure lies inside of you just gonna lay in the presence of the Sun and and re-ripened amen amen now the purpose that Satan planted the natural seed was simply to steal worship from God I'm just trying to keep it real simple it was to steal the worship from God he was jealous of God receiving the worship he wanted to steal it away from him and by default Satan ends up foreign worship from God when we don't worship [Music] this is there's no Switzerland here right there's good and evil there's worship God or we're not worship Him and that's all satan wanted to do he wanted to stop the worship that's all that was going on in heaven [Laughter] worshiping with their wings and praising and holy holy going out all the time time after a while he said you know I think I should get some of this stuff and just by default when he got one of the angels to just stop for a little bit that made him feel real good that made Satan feel real good when he got some of the angels to stop worshiping because they were doing the will of Saint Lucifer right you understand so when we're not worshiping we're doing the will of Lucifer ah I'm just trying to bring some light of how important it is for us to worship God and and not just stay in a kind of a neutral zone of of of God knows my heart yes God knows your heart but he wants you to worship him he wants you to praise him all ye that have breath praise ye the Lord we notice in the world that the people worship everything sports teams players musicians movie stars men and women who have achieved great things they will stand and they will applaud and they will paint their faces and they will get naked and they'll do everything to get excited and we come to church and we got frowns on her face and we don't understand why we're not so happy God created us to bring pleasure to him when you're when you're in church here and you're worshiping who cares about anybody else and who cares about what anybody's thinking amen amen because you're here for one purpose and that's to glorify God it's all that matters and if we all did that pretty soon we wouldn't really matter what was what was happening with anybody else and God inhabits the Praises of his people The More We Praise Him the more we can have it and I'll tell you when God's presence comes you're always happy you're always happy it does not matter honestly it does not matter if what he is speaking to you goes against the grain I've been there but when his presence is there it's like not an issue it's not an issue it's just when his presence is not there and you you hear that's why the Bible says speak the truth in love because you can really hurt somebody when you don't use love come on when God's presence is there it's just a beautiful beautiful but Satan has stolen away the worship from God in the church not just out there in the world and all these things that are happening in their worshiping everything else and they'll go and they'll give three hours to some football game but they won't go to church and lift their hands say I love you Jesus what is going on sees Satan the people in the world are blinded but the church shouldn't be blinded the church their eyes should be open that this is God's house this is his Sanctuary this is a many of Heaven this is the place where we come and worship Him from the dictates of our heart we give thanks to what he's done for us what he's given to us we can't out give out thank out worship god he has saved our soul and I'll be forever in debt for that he should receive our praise on a regular basis people refuse to worship God with all that's within him here we read about the Angels doing it day and night and people struggle some sit right in church expecting God to bless them without blessing God we all want God to bless us but sometimes we don't we don't bless God and worship him for one reason it's not my song what about your relationship what about that why is your relationship on hold this is the place you can come and really let loose let loose it's hard to do it in a grocery store yeah or in your McDonald's line but I'll tell you in church you should be able to just be yourself worship God worship your creator your savior your Redeemer your healer your provider Jehovah worship Him because if you don't do it you're fulfilling the natural seed you're fulfilling the will and purpose in which the wicked one planted his seeds right I want to make the devil feel uncomfortable you know it's it's sad but some people they don't mind receiving praise from others but they have a hard time praising God what is that what is that we've got to recognize what's going on I'll just say it real clear you were created to worship God to bring him pleasure let's practice it let's work on it let's work on it please him well brother John how do I do that well let's start by getting on our knees and say God I want to do that you know Express the desire to him he will tell you what to do when his presence come you can't help but praise him amen I don't want to achieve or fulfill Satan's purpose that's right and understand we go through trials we go through tests sometimes we're sick sometimes we're just not doing well that's the time to offer a greater sacrifice a greater sacrifice because the greater the sacrifice we read the prophet said the greater the reward God's purpose for planting his seed is to bring forth pleasure no wonder all of Heaven fell down and worshiped him that liveth forever and ever say and Worthy is the land that was slain I don't think it was a One-Shot deal I don't think it was a Netflix movie one time back in the 50s or 60s and no it's all the time he's worthy all the time he's a present God Amen not a past but a present God Amen praise did you know the Bible says that praise is actually perfected in the young plants you don't even got to be a full mature wheat to bring perfect praise to God you got to do is from the depths of your heart mean it as simple that's very simple you don't even gotta all you gotta do is get try just I Love You Lord and mean it from the dust your heart and he receives that receives it praise is so important to God that he literally will command the rocks to praise him if we don't think about how important it is to God it may not seem like important to us or we don't feel like doing it but that doesn't mean God don't want it right right he makes everything to praise him I believe the Bible talks about the leaves they clap their hands when the wind's going through the trees sometimes I think we need to change our attitude in the church stop allowing the Devil to steal praise away from God just because the way we feel if we're here if we come here let's just Praise Him will we sing a song wherever I am I'll praise him whenever I can I'll praise him He's Worthy Psalms 34 Verse 1. now this is what happened when David changed his attitude his behavior this is what he said and this is all we need to do I Will Bless The Lord at all times his praise shall continually be in my mouth my soul shall make her boast in the Lord The Humble shall hear thereof and be glad notice who is going to be happy about praise the humble not the proud the proud don't want to the proud are too proud oh magnify the Lord with me and let us exalt his name together Psalms 149 verse 1 praise ye the Lord sing unto the Lord a new song his praise and his praise where in the congregation of the Saints right where we're at right where we're at I think we've got scripture on what we're talking about here we got scripture no Hebrews chapter 13. verse 15 we know that Abel offered unto God a more excellent sacrifice right the scripture says let us offer the sacrifice of praise to God continually oh so we're like out there saying holy holy holy holy well you've been granted an opportunity to praise God in so many different ways let us offer the sacrifice see it's the sacrifice of praise to God continue that is the fruit of our lips giving thanks to his name amen now look at this next verse but to do good and communicate forget not for what such sacrifices God is well pleased God does not want you to forget to communicate with him he wants you to remember to communicate with him right it's it's a sacrifice that's well pleasing to God I think uh too many people forget to give thanks they forget to continually I'm here to Worship the Lord their mind is on so many other things you know what it's just get your mind on the Lord it doesn't matter if whatever's going on what's important is the Lord now we are not natural plants who refuse to praise God we're spiritual plants of God who can't wait to get to the house of church to worship Him we can't wait to get there it I'll tell you worship starts way before you get here and I'll tell you if you're doing what you need to be doing when you're not here when you get here you usually end up doing what you should be doing it's true it's true you're preparing you were never planted to do your own will nor to worship him at your own will because look my flesh if I yield to that will it may only want to worship once in a while but he didn't create a born-again son and daughter of God to worship him three times a week no no we're different we're different should always be a song of Praise on Earth on our our heart amen when I was in the world I'll tell you what I never worship God I didn't feel like it I exercised my own will and my will said I didn't want to I felt uncomfortable it's weird what do you mean I when I was growing up in my house uh you know my mom and dad they didn't get me and sent me around and say let's worship God it was so when I came into church and they were worshiping God this is weird I'm just being honest but when things begin to change all sudden you start counting your blessings you'll be surprised what God's done for you and then you you can't stop saying thank you Lord amen you find so many things to praise him for see to me it's it's more of an attitude it's really it's an attitude and if your attitude is I I I'm in Love with You Lord Nothing Else Matters you're just praising because he's worthy of all praise and all glory amen God planted us for his purpose and not ours now there are some similarities and differences in these two plants in many ways it's difficult to tell them apart one from another before wheat produces fruit the tares can look identical to the wheat in the spring wheat and tears end up growing together the tears naturally grow faster than the wheat did you know that and in fact they can grow uh bigger and their arms stretch out further and they can actually cover the wheat yes and and and and make it harder for the wheat to grow so you can't look at somebody and say man they're growing so fast that's not a that's not a uh identification come on the truth is that there are times that the tares are taller stronger and healthier than the wheat look at Matthew chapter 7. it wasn't until the fruit of the two plants began to bear the fruit that you could tell the difference and in Matthew chapter 7 verse 17 even so Jesus said even so every good tree bringeth forth good fruit but the corrupt tree bringeth forth evil fruit a good tree cannot bring forth evil fruit neither can a crop tree bring forth good fruit every tree that bringeth not forth good fruit is You Down cast in the fire whereby wherefore by their fruits you're going to know them look at the very next verse not everyone that saith unto me Lord Lord's under the kingdom of heaven but he that doeth the will of My Father which is in heaven the fruit of the wheat is to do the will of their father amen amen because he planted them for his purpose now we've got a fruit of the spirit but we're talking about the fruit of the wheat yes the fruit of God working in a person is love joy peace long-suffering and it it that is the Holy Spirit in his different ways but that same Spirit can be on the good and the evil produced the same thing and yet not be the fruit that God's that Jesus is referring to here the wheat must do the will of God that's all there is to it that's the fruit he's looking for it and of course if if the will of God is to love and to cover your brother and to lay down your life and all the things the prophet said and all the things that's what you do you live peaceably with all men you yes you're going to Bear the fruit of the spirit but you understand you can't just go by the times that God has used somebody his anointing the rain the falls on the just and the unjust and the Sunshine they're both growing they're both praising you can't go by that you go by one thing the fruit of obeying the word of God is that important we we got to we've got to pay attention to what's important to God that's the fruit he said when he said You shall know them by your fruit look there's many false prophets we heard about and we had a wonderful Bible men's meeting today did we not Brothers and and there's Satan can uh transform himself into an angel of Light we heard but he can't do the will of God he don't want to honor him and praise him and worship Him from with his life with obedience to the word so it's important that we understand we we all are the seed of God here amen amen okay what we what we've been planted for is to follow this word and to bring pleasure by obeying this word he says if you love me keep my Commandments foreign I'm not going to go over Galatians 5 22. but you can read it if you want to sometime it I I probably should read it just so we can so you can see Galatians 5 22 says but the fruit of the spirit is love joy peace long suffering gentleness goodness Faith meeting his Temperance against such there is no law but we know that God's presence falls on both the just and the unjust and can act very similar we can feel that awesome presence of God in our lives at times but it doesn't mean that we're bearing the fruit of obeying God's will I think that we got to remember but look at verse 24 it tells us about the seed of God here but they that are Christ have what crucified the flesh with the affections and the lust so if we live in the spirit let's walk in the spirit let's not be desirous now look at here's the natural going back to the Natural seed if you don't crucify the flesh you'll be desirers of vainglory you'll be provoking one another you'll be envying one another and that is what the natural seed does all right Matthew 24. now we're told in the last days that the two crops would be impossible for the foolish virgin to dify deficiate no yeah that's it that's the word I'm looking for the foolish version it's not going to be able to know the difference there's only one group of people Matthew 24 22 and accept those days be shortened there should be no flesh say but for the elect's sake those days shall be shortened thank the lord it's getting terrible out there then if any man shall say unto you Lo here's Christ or no look there is Christ believe it not for there shall arise false Christ false prophets and shall show Great Signs now that means if you look that up it means Supernatural miracles and wonders that's people who are in doubt and dude endowed with exceptional qualities or abilities that's that wonders people can do wondrous things in so much to the highest degree that if it were possible they shall deceive the very elect that the scripture says the elite can't be deceived something about the elect when they hear the word when they hear the word they're attracted to it yeah yeah they they want that manifested in them that's what they're wanting they because Jesus said man shall not live by brother but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God the bride is attracted to the word but see so many other people are attracted to the Miracles to the signs to the to the individuals who can do wondrous things but for some reason they don't check out to see if they're doing the will of God in their life yeah it didn't meant didn't Jesus say man you'll come to me in that day and say Lord Lord what about all these things I did right but they did not do the will of God and that's the fruit that he's looking for amen are you with me yes sir God wants us focusing on the fruit Satan wants us focusing on all the Miracles on the signs I mean you talk to the people in the world and they're always talking about signs try to talk to them about the word Jesus Christ is the word they're not even interested but I want to talk about this thing that happened what about this this change happening in you want to talk about that it's just that people are not focusing on the right thing and that's what Satan wants them to do they Satan wants them to get focused on other things now whatever his word says the elect are interested in it they're interested in obeying the word that they're not oh gain amen catch what I'm saying there it's easy to say Amen I've been baptized right right but how about amen you need to start because you're not doing that yet or you need to stop doing this because you are doing that still see the bride is interested in the part that she's not obeying because that's one way she's going to get complete see no wonder the prophet said we come to church to find out where we're at with him they're focusing on the part that they're not that's not connected yet the holy spirit is still leading all of us into all truth amen not just the the truth of of that God sent a prophet and but what did that Prophet say you know dig it into the word amen as the two plants mature it's much easier to see the fruit that they're bearing now the fruit of the wheat is so heavy it they when you look at a mature Wheat Field all the wheat is bowed you look at a mature Terror and it's sticking straight up proud as a peacock it just has it just doesn't want to bow but I believe a mature Christian is always humble they're bearing bearing deck because just like we read the elders they bow down and they worshiped uh what a I believe the wheat that he planted is also going to Bow before him yeah he's going to honor him gonna let him be first in their lives amen now although different the two seeds look similar on the outside but on the inside of the terror there's a little black seed and if you eat them it'll literally cause dizziness and nauseousness it'll cause you to be nauseous and I'm going to be honest with you I'm sure you've all experienced this spending some time fellowshipping with the wrong group and you get done and you feel a little dizzy you feel a little nauseous from what was just talked about are you with me so you need to make sure that you don't partake of the wrong influences amen now the tendency that people have in church is to weed out the terrors I mean that's exactly what the parable said in fact you think of a church you think well church should be this way there shouldn't it should be holy there should be all good people that go there and uh they should never do bad things and if if you hear one bad thing about anybody going to church well they're just an outright hypocrite right so the natural tendency is when there's something that's not right with someone in the church you need to rip that thing out right that's that's what that's that's the tendency I mean you think about when you have a garden weeds are coming up you don't want the weeds there you go on you pull the weeds out people look for things that don't belong in a church should be filled with only wheat kind nice people who care about me who want to help me who are concerned about me who lay down their life for me I feel it's all about me I come to church for me so when people aren't being good I think they shouldn't be allowed here big time brother big time but understand these are thoughts when we have thoughts about oh I just don't feel comfortable there I don't feel like being around that per that person that is a bad representation of the church you understand we have those thoughts of of wanting to that something's wrong and Jesus says let them both grow together don't be thinking like that they're there they're here they're here and they're supposed to be here the instructions are let them both grow together until the time of the Harvest we don't want to judge people we don't want to try pulling the weed out brother brother John what are we to do then grow in Grace right grow in love grow help lay down your life you can still be Christ to everybody we're supposed to be amen this message is not to start trying to pinpoint who the Terrors are and who the weed is this message is to help us not think negatively about others and grow together even if whoever they are are you with me can you say Amen to them God has called us to be fruit inspectors and then after we inspect the fruit you know what he says go lay down your life and if you don't want to do that then your church and God's Church are different churches I'm just saying God's will for his church is to allow tears and wheat to grow together in the same church until he sends his angels to separate them the servants should we go gather them up Nay last thou yes while you gather up the tears you root up the wheat with them all of our roots are intertwined we fellowship with one another and to be honest with you we kind of know one another's problems it might just we do and we we kind of have these ideas that this person shouldn't do that and they should know better so what help them help them if if there's a need help if you don't know how to help then get on your knees but to do anything different is wrong to talk about it to do nothing it's wrong the least you do is pray until God tells you what to do because you know God is in the business of perfecting us he the only time that he's going to get away and and go on that high wire is when our nature is so we got a such a wrong Spirit on us but as soon as that thing leaves the Holy Spirit comes back and he begins to lead and guide us into all truth now I believe that's what his that's what we are to do with one another to grow to grow together to help one another now we we obviously we've got to learn you think about this when your children were young you could spank them I was talking to brother Johnson today and he was telling me his his birthday he's going to be 90 years old on November 6th praise the Lord and the first thing I said to him I said well brother Johnson you must have honored your mother and your father because the promise is you get long life and but he says well one thing to help me was I I got a good Whip and I I I I I I I I I I got whipped if I didn't do the right thing or something along those lines and this is when I say when our children are younger sorry if I didn't say that just write brother Johnson when we were younger I could spank my children and tell them you're going to do what I tell you to do or you're going to get another one and they would somebody do it but you know when they turned 17 years old you don't walk around with the belt going like this like some cowboy you have to learn to work without that manipulative fear and that's what we need to learn to do as a church we don't just throw the word at somebody and say no no we need we need to love show love behind what we're trying to help that person with are you with me grow together in Christ praise the Lord no if someone's trying to yank you out of their Circle brother Bynum told us just draw a bigger Circle you're going to have the carnal seed you know bring it up stuff and trying to do stuff you just draw a bigger Circle you be Christ to them no matter what come on we should have heard more amens on that one let's grow together until the time of the Harvest the quicker we can accept that both the wheat and the tares are meant to be inside the church the better we're going to be the better we're going to be God doesn't want isms and schisms in the church body he doesn't need you telling others about Who's acting like a terror in the church the spirit of Christ doesn't need your knowledge of people's faults spreading around God doesn't need your negative opinions floating around right God doesn't need us dividing the body into sections just because something is wrong if something's wrong help what's wrong don't separate and try to get somebody else to separate right all you're going to do is bring disunity to the body and the devil will get you to do it because he's going to tell you you're spiritual you're right you know God showed you yeah that's right division you know the prophet said it Paul said it that you're one happy body right now but Satan won't allow it to stay that way so something's coming as sure as anything something is coming amen amen so what are we going to do when it's come are we going to all look up to the pastor you've got to Rally everybody together that's not what the prophet said that's not what Paul said we have to learn to stick together we have to learn to love one another to pray for one another to cover one another I mean this is what training is all about and then when we're out of the church and we're communicate with one another talking on the phone and tell that's the time that you put into action what you're hearing about the brand said that there's three types of believers in every Church the unbeliever the make-believer and the believer now the genuine believer not only believes the complete word of God but he follows the word of God remember the devil's believe right so there's a similarity between the devils and the believer they both believe and there's another similar did you know that they both tremble the Bible says the devil believes and trembles but according to Philippians chapter 2 verse 12 about write it down that we're to work out our own salvation with fear and trembling amen so we tremble for another reason because we don't want to displease God but see the reason they tremble is because they know they're not obeying their time is short and they're going to hell that's just that simple that's why they they they fear now the unbeliever that's in the church well he believes in God or he wouldn't be in church so he believes part but he does not believe all there's that's the unbeliever think about that he's not just the the atheist I'm oh I hate God don't believe God there's nothing by it so don't hey I got to go to church he's there's nobody that hates God or doesn't believe in God and says I got to go to church Faithfully you understand so it's got to be something that's closer so the Devils believe they got that knowledge of the reality in that Realm but they don't submit now the unbeliever he has uh could I'll say it like this could have a belief in some of the word but not all the word so the TR the part here is that he doesn't believe part I just don't believe that I believe the days of Miracles are passed I don't believe it you understand now the make-believer he makes the leaves that all the word of God in other words he could say Amen to every word of God but he doesn't submit to it so that's the mate that's the mate believer so they're not like you know big stamps on our forehead but understand this they're all allowed in the church because brother Brian said they're in every Church they're in every Church so the tears of hair we're a mixed group but we have to believe when we look at one another we're we're speaking to the elect of God here and we we treat one another like the the elect of God and when things happen that somebody didn't shake your hand right and somebody didn't they said this about you and they did this and they didn't let you in your circle and they cut you out you know what I don't want to hear it because you heard the word today you heard the word today what you're supposed to do now mature now mature if you're a wheat do the mature thing bow your head bow your head draw a bigger and just grow in Grace with the tears grow in Grace with the tares because that was what Jesus told us to do I just say you know we're without excuse here no matter what happens in this church we ought to be the happiest bunch because we're going to grow in Grace we're going to grow together just want two more scriptures here we're going to close one is Hebrews chapter 6 verse 7. let's focus on manifesting the part of Christ that we're not to become more of a Believer basically press toward the mark lay aside everything until you get perfect love for the tares we gotta love our enemy Hebrews chapter 6 verse 7 the Earth which drinketh in the rain that cometh often upon it and bringeth forth herbs meat for them by whom it is dressed receiveth blessing from God but they which bear thorns and Briars it's rejected and is nigh unto cursing whose and notice the end is to be burned it's at the end but beloved speaking to us here all of us but beloved we are persuaded better things of you and the things that accompany salvation though we thus speak Let There never ever be anything negatively spoken about anybody because there's better things that God expects of us his wheat sticks out they stick out just like God because they were created for a purpose now I'm saying if there's a need don't you just turn your your head away from it no if you see a need God is entrusted in you to do something yeah that's right that's right it start with prayer and and God give you Holy Ghost boldness to go wash somebody's feet and help them get them get them where they need to get to because if you just turn away say well you know just well how are you going to help the body the body is supposed to help the body function together see what we're hearing from the pulpit is what we're to become it's not what we are right it's what we're in the process of becoming when the Bible says grow grow together or grow in Grace it's it's actually going somewhere that you are not and this helping one another needs to become more of a reality more of a reality yeah the church I go to they really love one you know how do you know they love one another because they help you when you're not doing well when you fall they help you get back up they they pray for you they intercede for you they they they they care and and they they want to they want to meet you in the prayer room t we're one body undivided we stand together we grow together and we we don't even care who we think a terror is or who's not a tear or who an unbeliever is or who a mate Believers we don't care only thing we want to do is be such a weak that we can help help the situation because what's already set is set there's never you're never going to go into if you went into a church that was perfect the second you walked in it would be polluted you're never going to find a church that's perfect but if we can all get the mindset of doing our job that God has told us to do we will become a better Church and the thing is if we have the attitude well you know it's not me it's always the other person I'm telling you you're you're in you're the greatest culprit right right because it doesn't matter who the worst person is or who's got the greater need God has called us all to help you see what I'm saying it's like there's no excuse for the Church of God there's no no excuse for the elect of God they won't be deceived they know where they stand they know what they're needing to do are you with me our real estate and Taylor God bless you as part of growing up and that's a I believe Ephesians 4 tells us that that God gave us a a five-fold Ministry to grow up and um that's just bow our hearts in a word of prayer and our our heads bowed just looking to the Lord right now if your desire is to stretch higher closer to the Lord to to be more mature to to put away certain natural things and to be more spiritual as the scripture teaches us when someone would be Fallen overtaken into fall ye which are spiritual go to them in a spirit of meekness if you feel that you want to be this mature Christian just place that before the Lord as we go to pray because it's it's all an individual affair and I don't believe we need to be scared of what God's calling us to amen amen amen Heavenly Father we come to you as a as a body of Believers we're so grateful to you for Lord that you never gave up on us you never you never said well you you you you you went too far you you you you you you you you didn't uh try hard today on on I'm going to just uh leave you out no Lord you you were patient with us and you're your your Mercies flood into our lives every day Lord we thank you for your mercies we thank you for your grace Lord we want to show back Lord our gratefulness to you by by being patient with others by being gracious and merciful to others we remember Lord that you taught us when we prayed that if we don't forgive others you won't forgive us you really really want us to display who you are a god of forgiveness a God who loves no matter what and Lord I pray that you would bless our church Lord that you'd put a a hedge of protection around us Lord that you would help us all to mature that our our our our spirits and our attitudes could always have a be so full fruit that her heads are bowed in humility and Lord Desiring just to to to to be used of you for your purpose in any way that you would see fit Lord we pray that you would uh bless this body with a a multi-member body that Lord we could help one another so much that so much growth could be taking place Lord even though the world's going down the tubes and so many negative things are being said Lord we know the end is about us your coming is soon help us to focus on helping one another to
