[37:51] but no matter how many he just gets back
[37:53] up and he keeps going
[37:56] and
[37:57] we're thankful that God has provided a
[37:59] Grace and the blood
[38:02] to cover us

[38:07] can keep marching forward into the image
[38:10] of Jesus Christ amen
[38:13] amen God bless you let's stand together
[38:15] for the reading of the word and
[38:17] first John chapter 4
[38:20] . we got a chance to talk with brother
[38:22] Burley
[38:23] he appreciates
[38:25] uh our prayers for him he had um
[38:30] mouth surgery a couple weeks ago and I
[38:32] know her sister Kathleen is going
[38:34] through
[38:35] some uh mouth work as well so let's
[38:39] continue to hold her up
[38:42] um but
[38:43] our sister Lynn had been asking about
[38:46] brother burley's eye and he's going to
[38:48] be having surgery October 31st so if we
[38:52] could remember him for that need amen
[38:55] amen amen
[38:57] first John chapter 4
[39:01] we're going to read verse 7 verse 8
[39:03] verse 16 and 17 and then have a word of
[39:06] Prayer
[39:07] amen beloved let us love one another
[39:12] for for love is of God
[39:17] and everyone that loveth is born of God
[39:19] and knoweth God
[39:21] he that loveth not
[39:24] knoweth not God
[39:27] for God is love and that's a very strong
[39:29] statement he that loveth not he doesn't
[39:32] really know God
[39:34] for God is love and drop down to verse
[39:37] 16.
[39:39] and we have known we have known and
[39:42] believed the love that God have to us
[39:45] God is love
[39:47] and he that dwelleth in love
[39:50] dwelleth in God
[39:52] and God in him
[39:55] herein is our love made perfect that we
[39:57] may have boldness in the day of judgment
[39:58] because
[40:00] as he is so are we in this world
[40:05] amen let's look to God In Prayer
[40:08] Heavenly Father we thank you
[40:10] Lord that you have provided for us a
[40:13] place to come
[40:16] Lord and hear from heaven
[40:20] and we know this is only possible by
[40:24] your grace you promise to be we're just
[40:26] two or three would be gathered together
[40:29] in your name
[40:31] and Lord
[40:33] we have dedicated this house in this
[40:36] place for the honor and the uplifting of
[40:39] the word of God
[40:41] and father we thank you that you have
[40:44] watched over your word all these years
[40:48] Lord that you wanted this word to be
[40:51] pure and without touched by man's hands
[40:55] that in this last age before you're
[40:58] coming away that we would have the
[41:02] perfect word of God
[41:04] and we thank you Lord that you have
[41:06] identified yourself as a god of not just
[41:10] of love but you are love
[41:13] and we thank you today that you put it
[41:15] within our power to know you to know
[41:19] that love and to have that love inside
[41:22] of us
[41:24] Lord we pray today that you would bless
[41:27] every brother and every sister that's
[41:30] here
[41:31] Lord there are needs
[41:34] questions things on their minds Lord we
[41:39] know that thou art able to meet every
[41:42] need for you hold the power of Heaven
[41:45] and Earth
[41:46] we ask today Lord that you would give us
[41:50] your Revelation
[41:52] concerning the love of God
[41:56] Lord we know it's unexhaustible but we
[41:59] just pray that you would bring us a
[42:02] little closer
[42:03] bring us a Little Closer to You Lord
[42:05] show us
[42:07] yourself a little bit more that we might
[42:09] know what we are to become for we commit
[42:13] ourselves in this service with every
[42:15] need now into your hands bring yourself
[42:18] glory and honor for we pray in Jesus
[42:21] Christ's name amen amen God bless you
[42:24] may be seated
[42:27] but Jesus said by this shall all men
[42:30] know that you're my disciples if you
[42:32] have love one for another
[42:36] love is the identifying factor of God
[42:41] for God is love
[42:44] and the manifestation of this same pure
[42:47] love and a human being is the
[42:49] identification that we're connected to
[42:51] God that we're following God that we're
[42:53] Disciples of God
[42:57] everyone that loveth is born of God and
[43:00] knoweth God
[43:04] knowing god
[43:05] is love knowing God is love job 36 verse
[43:12] 26 is behold God is great and we know
[43:15] him not neither can we number his years
[43:19] uh because uh you can't search him out
[43:22] right it says neither can the number of
[43:25] his Years be searched out Romans 11 33
[43:29] says oh the depth of the riches both of
[43:32] wisdom and knowledge of God how
[43:34] unsearchable are his judgment and his
[43:37] ways past finding out
[43:40] for who can know the mind of the Lord
[43:44] Isaiah 53 verse 1 who have believed a
[43:47] report unto whom is the arm of the Lord
[43:49] revealed God is so great that we can't
[43:54] put him in a fishbowl and say there's
[43:57] God
[44:00] but yet God has not distant himself
[44:03] from his people
[44:07] because uh God has a desire
[44:12] of
[44:14] for his people to know him
[44:17] now the scriptures is really the only
[44:19] authentic thing that we have whereby we
[44:22] may be able to know God in a greater way
[44:24] I mean there's been a lot of books
[44:26] written about God and a lot of opinions
[44:29] and a lot of uh things that have been
[44:32] spoken but nothing gives us a more
[44:35] accurate comprehension of God than the
[44:37] Bible
[44:38] in first John chapter 2 verse 3
[44:42] first John chapter 2 verse 3 says and
[44:44] hereby we do know him
[44:49] uh hereby we do know that we know him if
[44:53] we keep his commandments so how many
[44:56] people say they know God and they have
[44:59] not even a Pursuit Of Interest of
[45:03] keeping the Commandments
[45:06] amen it it
[45:07] you know so our feeling is gonna can
[45:10] tell us all the time that we know God we
[45:13] might have had experiences with God but
[45:15] does that really mean we know him
[45:17] he saith I know him and keepeth not his
[45:21] Commandments is a liar and the truth is
[45:25] not in him so how many times have you
[45:27] saw somebody and the world is full of
[45:29] people who do not keep the Commandments
[45:31] can you say Amen to that and so how many
[45:34] times have we talked to somebody who
[45:36] wasn't keeping the Commandments and said
[45:37] you're a liar
[45:39] you know that but the truth is that's
[45:42] what the Bible's saying
[45:44] verse 5 but whosoever keepeth his word
[45:47] in him verily is the love of God
[45:50] perfected
[45:52] and hereby knowing that we are in him he
[45:55] that saith he abideth in him
[45:58] ought himself also sold to walk even as
[46:02] he walks so it's it's pretty important
[46:04] for us to know how Jesus walked
[46:07] and again not what some book tells us
[46:10] how we walked or are even our mom our
[46:14] dad or even our pastor we need to note
[46:16] for ourselves how Jesus walked because
[46:19] replacing our soul on it
[46:23] replacing our soul on that
[46:27] the scripture tells us he that hates his
[46:29] brother or sister is blind and he don't
[46:31] even really know God properly
[46:34] God's love doesn't think ill or evil of
[46:37] anyone
[46:38] God is kind he's good he he suffers long
[46:42] with his people he Bears all things he
[46:44] endures all things with his people
[46:47] first Peter 3 20 tells us which
[46:50] sometimes were disobedient when Once the
[46:53] long suffering of God waited in the days
[46:56] of Noah while the ark was a preparing
[46:59] were in few that is only eight Souls
[47:03] were saved
[47:06] a hundred and twenty years
[47:09] of patience and long-suffering
[47:13] and it didn't change the people's mind
[47:15] right
[47:19] his love just doesn't quit
[47:22] it doesn't fail
[47:24] he doesn't get puffed up he doesn't vote
[47:27] with himself he doesn't get offended
[47:29] when we don't try when we when we don't
[47:32] when we don't press in when we don't
[47:35] keep his commandment he don't get
[47:36] offended
[47:39] thank you
[47:41] it's our choice God is humble he's meek
[47:48] when he manifested himself
[47:51] the Bible says there was no beauty that
[47:53] we should behold amen he didn't come
[47:56] wanting to look good on the outside
[48:00] he hid himself from the world he was
[48:02] born in a stable
[48:04] there wasn't much to look at from the
[48:07] outside he didn't pump iron as it were
[48:11] his reputation of an illegitimate birth
[48:14] followed him throughout his entire life
[48:19] one time Jesus asked Peter who does men
[48:22] say that I am and there was all sorts of
[48:26] answers given there wasn't no continuity
[48:29] to it right amen no different than today
[48:35] Jesus said many will come to me in that
[48:37] day and say
[48:39] Lord
[48:42] I thought because of this we run the
[48:46] same page
[48:48] but he never knew them
[48:53] they must have not really loved God
[48:59] I believe that God is still hiding
[49:01] himself
[49:02] today from the wise and The Prudent
[49:05] anybody that has the that attitude
[49:09] the wrong attitude he hides himself from
[49:12] that
[49:13] he he opens himself up to those that
[49:17] have a humble contrite of me God I need
[49:21] you in my life I'm not good enough I I
[49:24] can't stand on my merits I I'm naked
[49:26] without you I need you Lord now that who
[49:29] God is interested in today amen
[49:33] God is love his love is pure there's no
[49:36] additives there's no partiality there's
[49:39] no respect to persons there's there's
[49:41] nothing like that it's just
[49:42] unconditional love
[49:45] Titus 1 verse 15 says unto the pier
[49:50] the pure in heart for they shall see God
[49:52] Amen unto the pure all things are pure
[49:55] but unto them that are defiled and
[49:57] unbelieving is nothing pure but their
[50:00] mind and their conscience is defiled
[50:04] now look at this they profess that they
[50:06] know God
[50:08] but in Works they deny him
[50:10] being abominable and disobedient
[50:13] and unto every good worker reprobate
[50:18] so what are the works that we need to be
[50:21] doing
[50:23] to know that we know him
[50:26] I believe God wants us to know him
[50:30] to know that he is love
[50:34] I believe that God wants us to become
[50:36] established in that love
[50:38] Ephesians chapter 3 verse 17 says that
[50:41] Christ May dwell in your hearts by faith
[50:46] that being rooted and grounded in
[50:50] Doctrine
[50:54] no it's love
[50:57] may be able to comprehend it is that
[51:00] love that gives us comprehension with
[51:03] All Saints what is the breath the length
[51:05] the depth and the height and to know the
[51:08] love of Christ which passeth knowledge
[51:11] that we might be filled with the
[51:14] fullness of God it is the love of God
[51:18] that brings the fullness of God Amen
[51:25] a clear perception of God's love is
[51:27] manifested when we forfeit our own will
[51:31] to help other some other soul
[51:36] first John chapter 3 verse 16 declares
[51:39] hereby perceive we the love of God
[51:41] because he lay down his life for us we
[51:43] ought to lay down our lives for the
[51:45] brother and I know you know these
[51:47] scriptures
[51:49] but I'll tell you I know that I need to
[51:52] be reminded of them everybody
[51:54] I know that I want to see my life laid
[51:58] down more for others
[52:00] I don't think I'm at that Plateau that
[52:02] I've that I've attained
[52:08] a clear perception of God's love is seen
[52:11] when we keep his word
[52:13] whoso keepeth his word in him verily is
[52:16] the love of God perfected
[52:21] we know him if we keep his Commandments
[52:23] this is what the word says
[52:25] in John 13 34 a new commandment I give
[52:29] you that you love one another as I have
[52:32] loved you
[52:33] that ye also love
[52:36] one another
[52:38] and by this shall all men will unite
[52:40] disciples if you have love one to
[52:46] another oh my last service we talked to
[52:49] a little bit about Liberty and yes
[52:52] sometimes we don't have Liberty to do
[52:55] everything that we want to do but we are
[52:58] given so much Liberty to serve one
[53:00] another
[53:01] right
[53:02] we Master take advantage of that because
[53:05] that's scriptural
[53:08] to to love one another exactly the way
[53:11] that Jesus loves us
[53:15] I believe there's a yearning inside the
[53:17] seed of God that's that's Longing To
[53:20] Love more like God loves
[53:25] to manifest it
[53:28] to to see it come out of our Lives the
[53:30] Bible says the whole earth is groaning
[53:33] and waiting for a manifestation of God
[53:38] and I I
[53:40] the one thing the devil can't do is love
[53:43] unconditionally
[53:46] he is so selfish right it's all about
[53:49] him right amen yeah
[53:53] and every man that has this hope he's
[53:56] purifying himself
[53:59] he's reaching forth for pure love only I
[54:03] want to entitle this message pure love
[54:05] only
[54:08] I believe every born-again Christian can
[54:11] can relate to Paul when he said oh that
[54:13] I might know him
[54:15] more there was that that longing for for
[54:18] more of God
[54:20] 's love is absolutely pure
[54:25] it's not mixed with selfishness or greed
[54:30] there's no hidden agendas
[54:33] there's no ill intense there's no wrong
[54:37] motives involved there's no respect of
[54:40] persons of I like this one more than
[54:42] that one
[54:44] there are no wrong Surprises with the
[54:47] love of God
[54:49] 's love is so pure
[54:52] so powerful that it can suffer when it
[54:55] don't get its way
[54:57] it can bear it can endure it can forgive
[55:02] and and
[55:05] it's so powerful that a perfect setting
[55:07] in of love in heaven could not manifest
[55:13] it
[55:15] there was a part of God's love there
[55:17] that could never be manifest there was
[55:19] nothing to forgive
[55:22] there was nothing to endure
[55:24] there was nothing to heal there was
[55:26] nothing to redeem but God had a longing
[55:29] inside of him to express this pure love
[55:32] as a Healer as a comforter as an
[55:35] intercessor as a high priest right
[55:38] as a Jehovah Jireh that could Supply our
[55:42] needs when there was no need to supply
[55:45] my name
[55:47] he wanted to be a gracious and merciful
[55:49] father but this setting in heaven was
[55:52] too perfect to express the vastness of
[55:57] this love right God is love
[56:01] so he he allowed evil and perversion to
[56:06] evolve and he allowed man to slip away
[56:09] from a perfect pure setting in the
[56:12] garden
[56:14] he permitted man to to fail in order for
[56:18] God to be able to show the rest of who
[56:22] he is
[56:23] [Laughter]
[56:26] Ephesians 2 verse 4 says but God who is
[56:29] rich in Mercy for his great love we're
[56:32] with he loved us
[56:36] now we can know God
[56:38] differently than the angels
[56:43] I don't think he's healed any of the
[56:45] Angels
[56:47] I don't think they got sick
[56:50] they're not redeemed
[56:55] always remember love was the reason
[56:59] love was the reason
[57:01] what was the reason for every problem
[57:07] he wanted to show himself greater than
[57:10] the problem
[57:13] and I'll say today I don't it doesn't
[57:14] matter what your your problem is
[57:18] the manifestation of God's love can take
[57:22] care of it
[57:23] the manifestation of God's love can take
[57:27] care of it
[57:28] love is the reason
[57:30] I want you to place yourself in the
[57:32] scriptures here Deuteronomy chapter 7
[57:34] verse 6 if you want to write it down
[57:39] the Bible says for thou art and holy
[57:43] people unto the Lord thy God
[57:45] the Lord thy God have not chosen thee
[57:49] to the Lord thy God have chosen thee to
[57:53] be a special people unto himself
[58:00] above all
[58:02] people that are on the face of the Earth
[58:09] the Lord did not set his love
[58:12] upon you nor Choose You
[58:16] because you were more in number than
[58:19] any people
[58:21] for you were the viewers of the people
[58:24] but
[58:25] because the Lord
[58:27] loved you amen just a pure love
[58:32] and because he would keep his word the
[58:36] oath which he sworn unto your fathers
[58:39] have the Lord brought you out of with a
[58:42] mighty hand and redeemed you out of the
[58:44] house of bondage from the hand of
[58:46] pharaoh king of Egypt
[58:48] the Lord did not set his love upon you
[58:51] and choose you because you were
[58:53] something special
[58:58] you weren't he didn't choose you because
[59:00] you were special
[59:03] but he chose you to be special
[59:07] him choosing you makes you special
[59:11] but you're not just special to do
[59:13] whatever you want to do
[59:15] special unto the Lord a special people
[59:19] unto him
[59:21] God has called you above everybody on
[59:24] the planet
[59:25] to be different than everybody else
[59:35] he's made you a special people
[59:38] too many Believers think
[59:40] God chose them because they were
[59:42] something special
[59:46] as if love wasn't his motive
[59:51] we don't want to get to a place like
[59:53] we're something special
[59:58] we need to realize that if we're special
[1:00:01] he made us special
[1:00:05] and he made a special for one purpose
[1:00:07] and it's to bring him glory and honor
[1:00:09] it's all about him
[1:00:12] it's never been about how we can just
[1:00:15] make ourselves something
[1:00:22] Jesus himself his own testimony of us
[1:00:26] there's none good
[1:00:28] there's none right not even one
[1:00:33] so the only he's the special one
[1:00:38] and he's God he can do what he wants to
[1:00:40] do and if he chose us we ought to Just
[1:00:43] Praise Him for choosing Us Praise Him
[1:00:46] give him on or give them glory and let
[1:00:48] them take our lives and use us as he
[1:00:51] would see fit but always remember that
[1:00:54] we're special because he made it special
[1:00:57] we don't want to take away from who we
[1:01:00] are we just don't want to make us
[1:01:01] something we're not
[1:01:04] foreign
[1:01:07] God loves us unconditionally
[1:01:10] with a pure love
[1:01:14] the Bible says that he don't even take
[1:01:16] pleasure in the death of the wicked
[1:01:18] there's just nothing in him that wants
[1:01:20] to see anybody get hurt
[1:01:24] I mean these people who decide
[1:01:28] that they don't want God that hurts God
[1:01:33] because they're turning down the only
[1:01:35] source of life
[1:01:38] and they've been so indoctrinated by the
[1:01:42] devil that they feel that they can just
[1:01:44] live their life
[1:01:46] on this Earth and not have to answer to
[1:01:49] anybody but not realizing that this life
[1:01:52] is just a vapor compared to Eternity
[1:01:56] [Music]
[1:02:00] amen God didn't make us a special people
[1:02:02] just for heaven
[1:02:05] he wants us to be special on this Earth
[1:02:07] he wants us to represent him on this
[1:02:10] planet
[1:02:12] First Peter chapter 2 verse 6.
[1:02:17] wherefore also it is contained in the
[1:02:20] scripture thank God for the scripture
[1:02:22] this morning
[1:02:23] behold I lay in Zion a Chief Cornerstone
[1:02:27] elect and precious and he that believeth
[1:02:31] on him shall not be confounded we know
[1:02:34] this is Jesus Christ the word
[1:02:37] and unto you therefore which believe
[1:02:41] he is precious
[1:02:43] but unto them which don't believe who
[1:02:46] are those they're the disobedient
[1:02:49] the stone which the builders disallowed
[1:02:52] the same is made the head of the corner
[1:02:56] and it's also a stone of stumbling
[1:02:59] and it's a rock of offense even to them
[1:03:03] which stumble at the Bible
[1:03:07] stumble at the word
[1:03:09] being disobedient where unto also they
[1:03:12] were appointed they were appointed
[1:03:15] but you
[1:03:16] are a chosen generation amen
[1:03:19] amen a royal priesthood a holy nation
[1:03:23] you are a peculiar people
[1:03:26] that you should show forth the Praises
[1:03:30] of him that have called you out of
[1:03:32] Darkness Into His Marvelous Light I hope
[1:03:35] you're not sitting here not wanting to
[1:03:37] Worship the Lord this morning because if
[1:03:39] you're chosen he has called you to bring
[1:03:42] forth Praises unto him
[1:03:47] personally which in times past here it
[1:03:51] is you were not a people you were not a
[1:03:54] special people
[1:03:56] but are now the people of God which have
[1:03:59] which had not obtained Mercy but now
[1:04:03] have obtained Mercy that should be
[1:04:05] enough to praise them
[1:04:07] we've been chosen to be a special people
[1:04:11] just for God
[1:04:17] to do what he wants us to do
[1:04:20] so brother John what does he want us to
[1:04:22] do just lay it out there just tell me
[1:04:24] what he wants me to do and I'll do it
[1:04:26] all right let's let's go to John chapter
[1:04:29] 15.
[1:04:31] I believe the Bible tells us that he
[1:04:34] wants us to love God back
[1:04:36] with our with all of ourselves
[1:04:39] and and the problem the problem that we
[1:04:41] the challenge that we have is since we
[1:04:43] were born with a a wrong nature to begin
[1:04:47] with that wrong nature was a selfish
[1:04:50] nature it was interested in only getting
[1:04:53] what it wants for its own reasons and
[1:04:55] motives and that thing has to die out in
[1:04:58] order for us to give all of our love to
[1:05:00] the Lord
[1:05:03] amen Jesus said if you love me keep my
[1:05:05] Commandments
[1:05:07] it wasn't like part-time it's even when
[1:05:10] we're not thinking about it
[1:05:12] Saint John 15 12. this is my commandment
[1:05:17] that you love
[1:05:18] one another
[1:05:21] not the way you think it should be done
[1:05:25] but as I have loved you
[1:05:28] and he has loved us so much
[1:05:31] that we we just wouldn't be here if it
[1:05:34] wasn't for his love
[1:05:35] but you know sometimes our love for
[1:05:37] somebody kind of boosts them out of our
[1:05:40] life
[1:05:42] I'm not loving them the way that God
[1:05:45] loves us
[1:05:46] we shouldn't want to boot anybody out
[1:05:49] [Music]
[1:05:50] we should just draw a bigger Circle
[1:05:53] bring them in
[1:05:55] well brother John you don't know what
[1:05:57] they did to me well you don't know what
[1:05:58] I did to Jesus
[1:06:00] we've all failed Jesus we've all let him
[1:06:03] down we've all turned we've all denied
[1:06:06] him at some time like Peter
[1:06:09] so who is anyone to say that I can boot
[1:06:13] somebody out
[1:06:15] so the Commandment it's the Commandment
[1:06:17] it's not a choice or an option I should
[1:06:20] say it's a Commandment that we love one
[1:06:24] another as as he has loved us and that's
[1:06:26] a that's a tall that's a tall order
[1:06:30] that's a tall order
[1:06:33] that's that's why we say Lord help me
[1:06:36] every day
[1:06:37] that's why we say Lord fill me with your
[1:06:39] spirit fill me with your love that I can
[1:06:42] manifest that I do know you
[1:06:44] because up here I know you Lord
[1:06:47] and sometimes I feel his presence and I
[1:06:50] know you Lord
[1:06:52] but the real proof comes in is when I
[1:06:54] love my brother and sister who when they
[1:06:56] do me wrong
[1:06:59] that's the real proof that I know him
[1:07:01] the acid test that's why Jesus said to
[1:07:05] this church Age come by of me go try it
[1:07:08] in the fire the real deity the real
[1:07:10] evidence that that you can love the
[1:07:13] unlovable
[1:07:17] Greater Love have no man than this
[1:07:23] that a man lay down his life
[1:07:25] for his friends
[1:07:30] and you are my friends
[1:07:32] remember your special people
[1:07:35] but you are my friends if you do
[1:07:37] whatsoever I command you
[1:07:40] henceforth I call you not servants for
[1:07:43] the servant no not what does Lord doeth
[1:07:45] but I have called you friends for all
[1:07:47] things that I've heard of my father
[1:07:50] I have made known unto you
[1:07:52] I'm so grateful that we go to a church
[1:07:55] where we're not hearing half of the word
[1:08:00] we're only here in part of the truth
[1:08:03] how are we going to make it to Heaven
[1:08:05] what part of the truth
[1:08:07] we need all the truth that's why we need
[1:08:09] a five-fold ministry that's why we need
[1:08:12] to get into those tapes
[1:08:18] you have not chosen me but I have chosen
[1:08:22] you
[1:08:23] and have ordained you that you should go
[1:08:25] and bring forth fruit and that your
[1:08:28] fruit
[1:08:29] shouldn't stop coming
[1:08:33] it should remain
[1:08:35] that whatsoever ye shall ask of the
[1:08:37] father in my name he'll give it to you
[1:08:40] that's what I'm saying we're talking
[1:08:42] about A Love Affair here and Love Will
[1:08:45] Conquer
[1:08:46] these things I command you that you love
[1:08:49] one another the emphasis is Love Is it
[1:08:53] because it's a subject it's because it's
[1:08:55] who God is
[1:08:57] God is love
[1:09:00] God wants our motive to be pure love as
[1:09:03] well
[1:09:05] do everything you do because of pure
[1:09:08] love
[1:09:13] he chose us from the beginning because
[1:09:15] he loved us
[1:09:18] and now today we love him back because
[1:09:21] he first loved us
[1:09:24] and he loved us knowing we were not good
[1:09:29] that means I must love those who I know
[1:09:34] are not good
[1:09:38] First Peter chapter 1 verse 2. says
[1:09:41] elect
[1:09:43] according to foreknowledge
[1:09:46] or selected or chosen to be a special
[1:09:48] people according to foreknowledge of God
[1:09:51] the Father through the process of
[1:09:54] sanctification of the spirit onto the
[1:09:57] obedience
[1:09:59] and the blood of Jesus Christ wow
[1:10:03] so we just can't be a special people and
[1:10:05] sit around do what we want to do
[1:10:07] that's exactly what the scripture is
[1:10:09] saying
[1:10:10] we have a part to play
[1:10:13] Romans 8 29 tells us what He selected as
[1:10:16] to to what kind of special people we're
[1:10:20] supposed to be unto himself the Bible
[1:10:22] says that God predestinated us to be
[1:10:25] conformed to the image of his son that
[1:10:27] he might be the firstborn amen many
[1:10:29] brother and so when he said to love
[1:10:32] others as I have loved you he's looking
[1:10:35] for the reproduction of himself
[1:10:39] to see himself reproduced the thing is
[1:10:42] we can't naturally carnally
[1:10:45] intellectually put that on
[1:10:51] we have to receive more of the Holy
[1:10:52] Ghost
[1:10:54] because the love of God is shut abroad
[1:10:56] in our heart by the Holy Ghost
[1:10:58] we need the life of God in us to live
[1:11:01] the life of God
[1:11:03] we can't live the life without the life
[1:11:06] it's impossible
[1:11:09] that'd be like trying to put peacock
[1:11:11] feathers in a crow
[1:11:13] just doesn't work it looks pretty from a
[1:11:15] distance but eventually you're going to
[1:11:17] see it's a crow
[1:11:20] first John chapter 3 verse 1.
[1:11:23] we've been chosen to be like him to make
[1:11:26] our reason and our motive for everything
[1:11:28] that we do pure love only first John
[1:11:32] chapter 3 verse 1 Be Love behold what
[1:11:36] manner of love the father has bestowed
[1:11:39] upon us
[1:11:42] that we should be called his son and his
[1:11:45] daughter
[1:11:46] therefore the world knoweth us not why
[1:11:50] doesn't it know us because it knew him
[1:11:53] not
[1:11:57] but we know
[1:12:01] we know
[1:12:06] how do we know
[1:12:08] because we love like him
[1:12:12] beloved now are we the sons of God and
[1:12:15] it does not yet appear what we shall be
[1:12:17] but we know that when he shall appear
[1:12:21] we shall be like him
[1:12:24] for we shall see him as he is every time
[1:12:28] we come to church we should see him a
[1:12:30] little bit better yes a little bit clear
[1:12:33] a little bit more it don't have to be
[1:12:35] game Busters but we need to see him a
[1:12:38] little bit more because he's in the
[1:12:40] unveiling of the word
[1:12:43] and every man that has this hope inside
[1:12:47] of him
[1:12:49] he purifies himself
[1:12:51] even as he is pure it's a continual
[1:12:56] process to where our love drops off a
[1:13:00] respect to persons
[1:13:02] drops off favorites
[1:13:04] drops off judgments drops off
[1:13:07] negativities drops off ill thoughts
[1:13:11] until we become just like Jesus
[1:13:18] now the Bible says we look through a
[1:13:19] glass directly but one day we're going
[1:13:21] to see pure love only amen
[1:13:25] Jeremiah 31
[1:13:28] verse 3.
[1:13:30] says the Lord have appeared of old unto
[1:13:35] me saying now he didn't just
[1:13:37] place his love upon us and to let it go
[1:13:39] but he says yea I have loved thee with
[1:13:43] an everlasting love
[1:13:45] therefore with loving kindness have I
[1:13:49] drawn thee
[1:13:52] an everlasting love he has loved us with
[1:13:55] so nothing is going to separate us but
[1:13:59] we have to come in perfect harmony with
[1:14:03] the word with what he's calling us to do
[1:14:06] no man can can pluck us out of the
[1:14:09] father's hand nothing can separate us
[1:14:11] from the love of God but there's choices
[1:14:13] very hard choices we have to make every
[1:14:16] day the choice is to love him back with
[1:14:18] the same love that he loved us with
[1:14:21] and it's not easy to do
[1:14:28] God's love is so pure
[1:14:32] that there's nothing selfish in it
[1:14:35] he doesn't manipulate people because
[1:14:38] they don't agree with him
[1:14:41] we get up in the morning we want to go
[1:14:43] do something wrong he's not going to
[1:14:44] stop every time stop us every time
[1:14:48] he's not going to do that
[1:14:52] because it's our will
[1:14:55] and his will
[1:14:59] doesn't manipulate man's will
[1:15:03] now he's capable and he does deal with
[1:15:07] his sons and daughters like his own
[1:15:09] children
[1:15:10] certainly he does
[1:15:14] but his own children are not robots
[1:15:18] they're not manipulated
[1:15:21] by a manipulator
[1:15:24] he's a teacher but he's teaching us to
[1:15:27] surrender our will to his will
[1:15:30] it's only the goodness of God that draws
[1:15:34] man to repentance
[1:15:36] pure love of of God it is his goodness
[1:15:41] that that people see that make them want
[1:15:44] to surrender to God
[1:15:48] foreign
[1:15:51] doesn't just make you cry
[1:15:55] oh my it just you just cry
[1:15:57] you just Lord I
[1:16:00] yeah I'm sorry that I did this thing
[1:16:03] yeah but I'm so sorry I hurt you
[1:16:08] I'm I'm sorry that I haven't represented
[1:16:12] you
[1:16:13] the way that you've
[1:16:15] wanted me to
[1:16:20] It's A Love Affair
[1:16:23] Deuteronomy chapter 6 verse 4 and we got
[1:16:26] these hard choices to make and what are
[1:16:28] the hard choices it's to love God back
[1:16:32] with the same love he gave us and how do
[1:16:34] I how do I love God back
[1:16:37] I love God back
[1:16:39] I love loving brother James the same way
[1:16:42] that God loves me
[1:16:44] that's how I love God back
[1:16:46] I lay down my life
[1:16:49] for others that's how I love God back
[1:16:52] what you've done to the least of these
[1:16:54] my little ones these little ones you've
[1:16:55] done it on to me
[1:16:58] Deuteronomy 6 4 here o Israel the Lord
[1:17:01] our God is one Lord
[1:17:04] right he has said his his pure love upon
[1:17:07] us what do we do and thou shall love the
[1:17:10] Lord thy God with all thine heart with
[1:17:13] all thy soul and with all thy
[1:17:17] might now if I was to ask every one of
[1:17:20] you can you tell me
[1:17:22] that you
[1:17:24] do that
[1:17:27] all the time
[1:17:31] that places this all on the same page
[1:17:35] that places all of us on the same page
[1:17:37] that we need to press in to what God
[1:17:40] desires of us
[1:17:44] and these words which I command thee
[1:17:47] this day
[1:17:48] I command them
[1:17:50] get them in your heart
[1:17:52] they shall be in thine heart
[1:17:56] can I just keep them there no Thou shalt
[1:18:00] teach them diligently unto your children
[1:18:04] and talk of them when thou cities in
[1:18:07] thine house and when thou walkest by the
[1:18:09] way and when thou layest down and when
[1:18:11] thou riseth up talk about the love of
[1:18:14] God when's the last time you sat down
[1:18:16] and talked to your son or your daughter
[1:18:19] about God's love
[1:18:22] well brother John you don't understand
[1:18:29] find a way
[1:18:32] find a way to fulfill the scriptures
[1:18:37] the more that you can talk about God the
[1:18:40] love of God the more that God will
[1:18:42] become more real in your life
[1:18:47] he just happens to come where those brag
[1:18:50] about him
[1:18:53] amen
[1:18:54] and thou shall bind them for a sign upon
[1:18:57] thy hand and they shall be in the front
[1:18:59] lights between thine eyes and thou shall
[1:19:01] write them upon the pulse of the house
[1:19:03] and on thy Gates so when somebody comes
[1:19:06] in to your house
[1:19:08] you don't want them to say oh what a
[1:19:11] pretty house
[1:19:12] what a pretty yard
[1:19:14] you want them to say oh the Lord is
[1:19:16] beautiful
[1:19:18] the Lord is beautiful
[1:19:21] that's who you want them to see amen
[1:19:25] Deuteronomy chapter 30. verse 15.
[1:19:29] see
[1:19:30] I have set before thee this day life and
[1:19:33] good
[1:19:34] and death and Evil
[1:19:37] and that I command thee this day to love
[1:19:40] the Lord thy God
[1:19:42] to walk in his ways
[1:19:47] amen and to keep his Commandments
[1:19:50] his statues his judgments why do I got
[1:19:53] to do that brother John that thou mayest
[1:19:56] live and multiply
[1:19:59] and the Lord thy God shall bless thee in
[1:20:02] the land where thou goal is to possess
[1:20:04] it
[1:20:07] amen
[1:20:08] you know too many people have the idea
[1:20:11] that once they repent and get baptized
[1:20:16] they're automatically saved nothing's
[1:20:18] going to change that so what does it
[1:20:21] matter to do anything else
[1:20:25] and I'll say this is nothing that I'm
[1:20:29] putting on anybody that thinks those
[1:20:31] thoughts
[1:20:32] this is all comes from the devil I know
[1:20:35] where it comes from
[1:20:37] he has tried to convince people to lay
[1:20:41] back
[1:20:43] because the thing that the devil is
[1:20:45] scared of he's scared of the weakest
[1:20:48] Christian on his knees saying God I need
[1:20:51] you I need your love I need to be filled
[1:20:54] with your spirit I can't make it on my
[1:20:57] own
[1:21:01] he don't want to see that he'd rather
[1:21:02] see somebody that knows the scripture
[1:21:04] really good come in the church puffed up
[1:21:08] thinks there's something and can quote
[1:21:10] the scripture that's who the devil wants
[1:21:13] to see
[1:21:15] but he don't want to see some weak
[1:21:17] Christian
[1:21:19] calling on God at the altar
[1:21:23] he's scared of that
[1:21:25] think about where the power is at the
[1:21:28] power is not in US
[1:21:32] the power is in US
[1:21:35] you understand what I'm saying it's not
[1:21:38] in what we know it's in what we possess
[1:21:41] and the thing is the devil knows they
[1:21:45] that call upon the name of the Lord
[1:21:46] shall be saved the devil knows that if a
[1:21:50] weak Christian draws nigh to God God's
[1:21:52] going to draw an eye to him that's what
[1:21:54] makes the demons tremble it isn't us
[1:21:56] it's God moving in on the scene
[1:22:04] verse 17 but if thine heart turn away
[1:22:08] so that thou will not hear
[1:22:12] but shall be drawn away and worship
[1:22:15] other gods and serve them
[1:22:20] well this scripture is telling me
[1:22:22] that after I
[1:22:24] start out with God that I can turn away
[1:22:30] that I can I can be drawn away you know
[1:22:33] what makes this age the hardest age of
[1:22:36] all the ages
[1:22:39] there are more things in this age to
[1:22:43] entice our flesh and distract us than in
[1:22:47] any other age before us
[1:22:50] [Music]
[1:22:52] and I'll tell you the more that we
[1:22:54] indulge ourselves in those things the
[1:22:57] harder it is to love God
[1:23:00] the the more we just don't care about
[1:23:03] anything and we we develop that Spirit
[1:23:05] of of need of nothing
[1:23:07] and the devil tricks us that I got God
[1:23:10] nothing else matters and
[1:23:14] but that when we spend time too much
[1:23:18] time on things
[1:23:20] that are not him what are we actually
[1:23:23] doing
[1:23:24] we may not be saying
[1:23:27] oh YouTube oh YouTube
[1:23:32] or old movies
[1:23:35] but what are we doing when we're making
[1:23:38] those our head
[1:23:40] because we're spending time with that
[1:23:43] so much time
[1:23:46] those I'm trying to do here
[1:23:49] we don't got to close line but to close
[1:23:51] out and telling you what you can can't
[1:23:52] do what I am saying is put God first
[1:23:54] make sure he stays first because the
[1:23:57] devil sure got plenty enough to keep us
[1:23:59] away
[1:24:03] I denounce unto you this day
[1:24:07] that you shall surely perish
[1:24:10] and that ye shall not prolong your days
[1:24:13] your days upon the lamb whether they'll
[1:24:15] pass it over George to possess it
[1:24:18] right so I know this is the second time
[1:24:19] he's talked about possessing in other
[1:24:22] words we need to come to church
[1:24:24] understanding that we got land to
[1:24:26] possess
[1:24:28] I come here for a reason I come here to
[1:24:30] get more than what I got there's more of
[1:24:32] Christ for me
[1:24:34] he says I call Heaven and Earth to
[1:24:37] record
[1:24:38] all my money you know if you're going to
[1:24:40] get married you got to go to court
[1:24:43] you got to sign this thing
[1:24:45] you got to have people witness it
[1:24:48] there needs to be a document
[1:24:51] and here I call Heaven and Earth to
[1:24:54] record this day
[1:24:57] it's against us
[1:25:00] that I have set before you life and
[1:25:02] death blessing and cursing therefore
[1:25:04] choose life
[1:25:06] that both thou and thy seed
[1:25:09] may live
[1:25:10] it is brother sister it's not been our
[1:25:14] original decision to serve God that's
[1:25:17] not the issue that's never been the
[1:25:19] issue the issue is what are we doing
[1:25:21] every day
[1:25:23] what are we choosing every day because
[1:25:24] we are making a choice every day we get
[1:25:27] up
[1:25:31] that thou mayest love the Lord thy God
[1:25:33] and that thou mayest obey his voices
[1:25:35] that thou mayest cleave unto him for he
[1:25:38] is thy life and the length of thy days
[1:25:40] that thou mayest dwell in the land which
[1:25:42] thou the Lord sweared unto thy fathers
[1:25:45] to Abraham Isaac and to Jacob to give
[1:25:48] them
[1:25:50] you know most Christians are not pressed
[1:25:53] into the Promised Land
[1:25:55] but we need to be
[1:25:59] don't turn away don't get sidetracked
[1:26:02] cleave to the Lord
[1:26:07] our hearts can feel like we're serving
[1:26:09] God even when we're not
[1:26:12] I have found myself guilty of this more
[1:26:16] times probably than I certainly want to
[1:26:19] say
[1:26:21] but you'd need a calculator
[1:26:25] you know to be honest with you you need
[1:26:27] a calculator
[1:26:28] and the reason for this is Jeremiah 17
[1:26:31] verse 9 says the heart is deceitful
[1:26:33] Above All Things
[1:26:35] is desperately wicked and who can know
[1:26:38] it
[1:26:39] and so
[1:26:41] for you to say I know my heart brother
[1:26:45] you're you're literally don't know what
[1:26:47] you're saying
[1:26:50] the only one that really knows is God
[1:26:55] and the word is a discerner of the
[1:26:57] thoughts and Tents of a heart that's why
[1:26:58] when we come to church we come to find
[1:27:00] out when God speaks to Something's bear
[1:27:03] and witness well that was for me
[1:27:05] that's the word speaking to us
[1:27:10] verse 10 says I the Lord search the
[1:27:13] heart
[1:27:14] I try the Reigns even to give every man
[1:27:17] according to his way and according to
[1:27:20] the fruit of his doings brother John
[1:27:21] that seems to be kind of negative no it
[1:27:23] doesn't just start praising the Lord
[1:27:24] start let your doings magnify the Lord
[1:27:27] just say Lord I want to walk in your way
[1:27:29] and be blessed be blessed for your
[1:27:31] doings he said behold I come quickly and
[1:27:34] my reward is with me to give every man
[1:27:36] according to his works it doesn't mean
[1:27:38] your works are evil
[1:27:41] all right
[1:27:45] but it should make us want to make sure
[1:27:48] that our works are pleasing to him amen
[1:27:53] amen pure love only must be our motive
[1:27:56] for choosing God it can't be to escape
[1:27:58] tell
[1:28:00] me you know mine started there it did
[1:28:03] and maybe a lot of peoples did
[1:28:07] but it can't remain there it needs to
[1:28:09] become a love affair
[1:28:13] choose to serve God because you love him
[1:28:17] because you love him only there's no
[1:28:21] other reason
[1:28:24] it should be the reason for mortifying
[1:28:26] the Deeds of your flesh
[1:28:28] for dying out to your will
[1:28:32] for loving not our lives unto death as
[1:28:34] the Bible says for esteeming others
[1:28:37] better than ourselves
[1:28:40] it it needs to be pure love only not
[1:28:43] because oh the Bible says
[1:28:47] the Bible is not do's and don'ts his
[1:28:50] Commandments are not Grievous we should
[1:28:52] just be so I can't wait to love I can't
[1:28:57] wait to do this for the right reason
[1:29:00] if our motive is anything less than pure
[1:29:03] love only I'm telling you we're going to
[1:29:05] be shaken away
[1:29:08] God doesn't want anything less in heaven
[1:29:11] but pure love only
[1:29:15] if you battle selfishness selfish
[1:29:17] motives about things I'm telling you
[1:29:19] this is the day to start shaking it off
[1:29:22] just Shake It Off
[1:29:24] to say I refuse this in my life I'm
[1:29:26] getting rid of this I'm not entertaining
[1:29:28] thoughts anymore
[1:29:30] Hebrews chapter 12 verse 25 says
[1:29:33] see that ye refuse not him that speaketh
[1:29:37] for if they escape not who refused him
[1:29:40] that spoke on Earth
[1:29:42] much more so not we escape if we turn
[1:29:46] away from him that speaketh from Heaven
[1:29:49] whose voice then shook the Earth but now
[1:29:52] he have promised he made this promise
[1:29:55] saying yet once more I shake not the
[1:29:59] Earth only
[1:30:01] but I'm shaking heaven
[1:30:05] there's a shaking coming
[1:30:07] and that's why our Focus must seriously
[1:30:10] be on pure love
[1:30:12] just get rid of anything else that is
[1:30:15] not pure love
[1:30:17] and this word yet once more signifying
[1:30:21] the removing of those things which are
[1:30:23] shaken as of the things that are made
[1:30:27] man-made man-made ideas are the devil
[1:30:30] made that those things which cannot be
[1:30:34] shaken May remain
[1:30:38] the word is going to shake off anything
[1:30:41] that's not pure God pure love
[1:30:46] that's why we want to get rid of it
[1:30:48] wherefore we receive in a kingdom which
[1:30:51] cannot be removed cannot be moved let us
[1:30:54] have Grace whereby we may serve God
[1:30:57] acceptably with reverence and godly fear
[1:31:02] reverence and godly
[1:31:05] fear
[1:31:08] for our God is a consuming fire
[1:31:11] I'll tell you if we focus on that there
[1:31:14] won't be any room for our flesh
[1:31:16] [Music]
[1:31:20] it's just when we take our eyes off of
[1:31:22] that it gives a chance for the enemy to
[1:31:24] get in there
[1:31:28] That's why nothing can separate us from
[1:31:30] the love of God because we have received
[1:31:34] the love of God into our hearts that's
[1:31:36] the kingdom of God it doesn't come with
[1:31:38] observation it doesn't come with
[1:31:40] knowledge it's a it the love of God is
[1:31:42] shed abroad in the Heart by the Holy
[1:31:44] Ghost and it's it's it's as real as God
[1:31:47] is real
[1:31:49] the thing that we got to learn to do
[1:31:53] is stay more in his presence waiting for
[1:31:56] more
[1:31:57] time
[1:31:59] just spending time calendar of the month
[1:32:02] waiting for God's love to come in our
[1:32:03] heart is not going to do it
[1:32:06] he's looking for Hunger for thirst for
[1:32:09] longing for calling for seeking for
[1:32:12] knocking for asking for drawing knife
[1:32:15] for for fasting for praying for crying
[1:32:18] out God is looking for us to do our part
[1:32:23] right but remember
[1:32:26] if he did it for somebody he'll do it
[1:32:28] for you
[1:32:29] yeah it's got to he's the same yesterday
[1:32:32] today and forever
[1:32:36] now Moses he chose to suffer the
[1:32:40] Affliction with the people of God than
[1:32:41] to enjoy the pleasures of sin for a
[1:32:44] season he made the hard choice to suffer
[1:32:48] and I'll say it like this
[1:32:49] when you choose to love unconditionally
[1:32:53] no side motives no negative no hidden
[1:32:57] agendas but when you make that decision
[1:32:59] I'm just going to love and forgive with
[1:33:02] all my heart you know you're making a
[1:33:04] hard choice
[1:33:06] it's the harder way it's suffering when
[1:33:09] somebody slaps you on the cheek and you
[1:33:11] got to turn your other cheek
[1:33:14] when our nature is just to get
[1:33:17] I'm going to go home and tell tell tell
[1:33:25] it's hard to do it God's way hard
[1:33:31] he chose to suffer every day not just
[1:33:34] once but every day
[1:33:36] the Affliction with the people of God
[1:33:39] than to enjoy
[1:33:41] I don't have to do that
[1:33:46] remember when the Lord spoke to brother
[1:33:48] Branham and he said these words
[1:33:51] because thou has chosen the Narrow Path
[1:33:54] the harder way
[1:33:56] thou has walked of thine own choosing
[1:33:59] thou has did this by thine own choosing
[1:34:03] thou has picked the correct
[1:34:07] and the precise decision
[1:34:10] wow
[1:34:11] the brother brother Batman God knows
[1:34:14] about precision
[1:34:17] he knows about millimeters and and and
[1:34:21] thousands and and tens of thousands
[1:34:26] thou has picked the correct and precise
[1:34:30] decision and it is my way
[1:34:35] and because of this momentous decision a
[1:34:38] huge part of Heaven it's waiting for you
[1:34:44] what a glorious decision thou has made
[1:34:47] he keeps bringing it back to the
[1:34:49] decision that brother Brandon made
[1:34:52] this in itself this decision in itself
[1:34:56] this in itself
[1:34:58] is that which will give and may come to
[1:35:00] pass that tremendous victory in love
[1:35:04] divine
[1:35:07] and then
[1:35:09] brother Branham
[1:35:11] could have chose
[1:35:13] to take part of the Gospel
[1:35:18] but he chose to take all the gospel
[1:35:24] he chose to love those that didn't truly
[1:35:28] love him that lied to his face
[1:35:32] that talk behind his back he chose to
[1:35:34] love them anyways and it was the harder
[1:35:37] way but it was the precise way the
[1:35:40] correct way and it is God's way and it
[1:35:42] will always be God's word it'll never
[1:35:44] change I don't care what they do to the
[1:35:47] Constitution I don't care what this
[1:35:49] world turns into a Sodom and Gomorrah
[1:35:51] God's word ain't changing God ain't
[1:35:53] changing love is the way
[1:36:02] when you choose to love the Lord with
[1:36:04] all of yourself
[1:36:07] you're choosing the harder way
[1:36:12] pure love only
[1:36:17] great peace have they that love thy law
[1:36:20] and nothing shall find them you ever get
[1:36:22] hurt offended bothered by something
[1:36:25] somebody did to you let me see your
[1:36:26] hands
[1:36:28] all right hum
[1:36:30] how how many
[1:36:34] does this happen to a lot
[1:36:39] okay
[1:36:41] honey doesn't want to be honest in this
[1:36:43] quiz
[1:36:49] the more you fall in love with the word
[1:36:52] the more you're falling in love with God
[1:36:54] Amen amen see the
[1:36:56] world
[1:36:57] loves God for what God does for them
[1:37:01] but like any any child
[1:37:05] when they get spanked
[1:37:08] I remember getting spanked by my dad
[1:37:12] and it hurt
[1:37:13] by the way
[1:37:17] and I was read
[1:37:21] so kind of give you an idea
[1:37:24] and I cried
[1:37:26] and when he left the room
[1:37:28] I didn't run out of the room and say Oh
[1:37:30] Daddy thank you for correcting me
[1:37:35] no correction is joyous
[1:37:40] but it did yield in obedience
[1:37:43] I just say it like this fall in love
[1:37:46] with the word
[1:37:47] great peace have they that love thy law
[1:37:50] and nothing shall offend them offenses
[1:37:53] are going to come people are going to
[1:37:55] bother you let them bounce off of you
[1:37:57] like a pinball because you're so in love
[1:37:59] with Jesus Christ
[1:38:01] that's all that matters
[1:38:03] so when brother Brandon he visits beyond
[1:38:05] the curtain of time he told us that
[1:38:07] nothing but perfect love is going to
[1:38:09] enter in
[1:38:11] he said whatever you do lay aside
[1:38:13] everything you got going in your life
[1:38:16] and pursue it if it be the will of God I
[1:38:18] want to talk about pursuing perfect love
[1:38:23] lay everything aside until you get it
[1:38:28] don't just stop living life and just sit
[1:38:30] here wait for it to come
[1:38:31] no stop spending time in so many areas
[1:38:34] of your life and spend more time saying
[1:38:36] God fill me with perfect love
[1:38:38] that's what that scripture that's what
[1:38:40] brother Brian I'm saying
[1:38:46] Jesus talked about this pure love in
[1:38:48] Matthew chapter 5.
[1:38:51] he challenged our human love
[1:38:55] verse 46 Matthew 5 46 and we're we're
[1:38:58] closing a very very
[1:39:02] you know today
[1:39:09] he says in verse 4 he says for if you
[1:39:11] love them which love you what reward
[1:39:14] have you
[1:39:15] don't even Republicans the same
[1:39:18] if you salute your brother and your
[1:39:20] favorite brother's only
[1:39:22] what do you more than others do not even
[1:39:25] the public and so
[1:39:27] so he's challenging human love
[1:39:31] any love that's with that is with
[1:39:34] respect of persons
[1:39:39] is not heaven material
[1:39:48] I don't think God wants anybody in
[1:39:50] heaven that's going to shake hands with
[1:39:51] this person this person this person I
[1:39:53] got a problem with that one
[1:39:55] foreign
[1:39:57] well brother John I don't think I have
[1:39:59] to worry about that because you know
[1:40:01] when I die God's got that all taken care
[1:40:03] of and he's going to make sure that all
[1:40:04] that's the way it is in heaven no
[1:40:06] character is built here
[1:40:08] it's not a gift it will be a victory you
[1:40:11] will have a choice you can choose life
[1:40:13] or death
[1:40:16] and choosy life is harder it's a
[1:40:18] straight and narrow it's harder to to
[1:40:20] turn the cheek into love
[1:40:24] but he says in verse 48 he says if if
[1:40:27] this is what the kind of love you have
[1:40:30] it be ye therefore perfect even as your
[1:40:32] father which is in heaven is perfect
[1:40:34] don't stay here
[1:40:39] go on to perfect love
[1:40:41] go on to pure love only
[1:40:44] amen and he talks about that verse 44
[1:40:46] and 45 44 says but I say unto you love
[1:40:50] your enemy
[1:40:51] bless them that curse you
[1:40:54] do something good
[1:40:56] for somebody that hates you
[1:40:58] [Music]
[1:41:01] pray for them
[1:41:03] that use you
[1:41:07] not just use you
[1:41:09] but they know it and you know it they're
[1:41:13] using you
[1:41:14] over and over again
[1:41:18] despitefully you know you can still love
[1:41:22] them
[1:41:22] no it's not you
[1:41:24] got in you you become one with God you
[1:41:29] agree with God
[1:41:31] and it's not just oh God help them not
[1:41:34] to use me
[1:41:36] God get that Spirit off of them so they
[1:41:38] can be just like you
[1:41:41] foreign
[1:41:42] it's a love that you have
[1:41:45] Amen to see Christ in them pray for them
[1:41:48] which despitefully use you and persecute
[1:41:50] you do you know anybody like that
[1:41:55] that ye may be the children of your
[1:41:57] father which is in heaven for he maketh
[1:41:59] the son to rise on the evil and the good
[1:42:01] and he sends the Reign on the just and
[1:42:03] the unjust
[1:42:05] pure love only love is the reason
[1:42:13] to get this what Jesus is calling us to
[1:42:16] get it won't be a gift it will not come
[1:42:18] by automatically coming to church
[1:42:21] there is no church that you can go to
[1:42:23] Faithfully to automatically get perfect
[1:42:25] love there isn't
[1:42:28] it it doesn't come with natural the
[1:42:31] sacrifice of it I'm just going to go to
[1:42:33] church and somehow I'm going to be like
[1:42:35] Jesus no
[1:42:36] It's A Love Affair
[1:42:38] it's God speaking to your heart about
[1:42:40] what he wants you to start working on
[1:42:42] and it means something to you when you
[1:42:44] leave church that you actually start
[1:42:45] going to work on it
[1:42:48] and
[1:42:50] you get blessed for it
[1:42:52] and then you come back Lord I'm here
[1:42:55] reporting for Duty
[1:42:57] well what would you have your servant do
[1:42:58] what's next Lord
[1:43:05] let's Stand Together
[1:43:20] pure
[1:43:22] love only
[1:43:32] a scripture allowed services for
[1:43:34] bothering you have been called unto
[1:43:36] Liberty only used not Liberty for an
[1:43:38] occasion for the flesh but by love
[1:43:40] serve one another see in other words you
[1:43:42] got a choice
[1:43:43] what you do with your Liberty
[1:43:46] pure love only is just serve
[1:43:49] serve others
[1:43:51] with the raw motives
[1:43:53] you mix things
[1:43:56] and this is such a mixing age
[1:43:59] and to think that I haven't separated
[1:44:02] enough I'm going to be honest with you I
[1:44:04] have not separated enough
[1:44:07] God is calling us all to separate to its
[1:44:10] pure love only and I'll tell you it's a
[1:44:14] it's a it's an honor
[1:44:17] to be called to be his special people
[1:44:22] to be a people unto himself
[1:44:25] not partial but but all the way
[1:44:30] amen
[1:44:32] let's bow our hearts in a word of Prayer
