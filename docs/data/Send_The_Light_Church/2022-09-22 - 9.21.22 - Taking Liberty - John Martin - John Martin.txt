homie's grateful for that that's a honestly a a really good course to enter into the message we're going to talk about liberty and he set us free amen he set us free and he has placed us in a a position of liberty and we just give thanks to the lord for his amazing grace today turn with me if you would to the book of luke chapter 4 verse 16 through 21 is going to be our opening scripture um how many is praying for our brother bruce amen amen we want god to be with him every step of the way amen amen before we begin reading let's just ask god's presence on this part of the service heavenly father we thank you lord that you put it in our hearts to be in your house today and you have given us liberty here to worship you in spirit and truth and you inhabit the praises of your people and your word declares with the with the spirit of the lord as there's liberty and and father we just pray that you'd come and take liberty now in the in the hearing of the word and the ministering of the word that you both blessed the ears and the lips lord that would partake of this word now we're unworthy to look at it lord we're unworthy to hear we're unworthy to speak it but lord if if you would come by your grace and just grant to us lord a deepness in this liberty father we would be so appreciative for your grace today as we commit the service to you with all the needs that this body has lord those that are here those that are not here in their homes all the sicknesses lord that we've been praying for remember each one of them we pray we love you we thank you for these things now lord we pray them in jesus christ's name amen amen amen saint luke chapter 4 starting with verse number 16 and he came to nazareth where he had been brought up and as his custom was he went to the synagogues on the sabbath day and stood up for to read and there was delivered unto him the book of the prophet isaiah and when he had opened the book he found the place when it was written the spirit of the lord is upon me because he have anointed me to preach the gospel to the poor he have set have sent me to heal the brokenhearted to preach deliverance to the captives and to recover the sight of the blind to set at liberty them that are bruised to preach the acceptable year of the lord and he closed the book he gave it again to the minister and he sat down and the eyes of all them that were in the synagogue were fastened on and we began to say unto them this day is the scripture fulfilled in your ears amen god bless you may be seated we just want to entitle this message taking liberty taking liberty just we want to broaden our our scope of understanding about liberty amen not so much in an evangelistical way um but uh in a way to to to greater give us an understanding and how many has ever wondered why there wasn't more liberty in our church has anybody ever wondered that okay praise the lord praise the lord you know the high priest he had liberty to go into the holiest of holies once he take the take this liberty go in there and offer the sins of the people he had liberty to do that but that but that doesn't mean he could do whatever he wanted to or do it the way he wanted to he still had to use the liberty that was given to him to do it the way god wanted him to [Music] when someone comes over your house do you do you want them to feel welcomed of course do you want them to to sit down if they want to sit do you want them to ask for a glass of water if they're thirsty you want them to feel that liberty do you you want them to to better use the bathroom if they want to use the bathroom of course you want them to have that liberty but do you want them going through all the drawers in your house in your bedroom so but what if they want to see it doesn't matter liberty has boundaries liberties have boundaries we think about uh it also has responsibilities we think about the ten the parable where the talents were given out and jesus said just take your liberty and go do what you want to do with these but i want to return and those that took their liberty to do what they wanted to do with it got in trouble but those that took the liberty that they had and did what god told him to do got rewarded so liberty isn't necessarily what we think liberty is in the message the mighty conqueror brother branham said the spirit of the lord is in this building tonight to set free and give liberty for the mighty conqueror has paid the price and men are at liberty to be healed and to be set free oh how precious is his word to us now we read in our opening scripture that this jesus said the spirit of the lord is upon me but that spirit led him to calvary it didn't lead him to do what he wanted to do but to go to calvary calvary is where the price was paid for our sins where we got liberated from amen amen the price for our liberty was paid at calvary isaiah 53 verse 4 says surely he had borne our griefs and carried her sorrows yet we did not esteem him stricken smitten of god and afflicted but he was wounded for our transgression he was bruised for our iniquities and the chastisement of our peace was upon him and with his stripes we are healed this was for our liberty jesus took his liberty and walked in obedience to what the father told him to do that we might have liberty ephesians chapter 2 verse 1 says and you have he quickened who were dead in trespasses and sins where in times past ye walked according to the course of this world according to the prince of the power the spirit that now worketh in the children of disobedience among whom also we all had our conversations in times past fulfilling the lust of the flesh or i could just say like this the liberty to do what we want to do fulfilling the desires of the flesh and of the mind and we're by nature the children of wrath even as others if you if you just didn't get what you want you made it known but god who is rich in mercy for his great love wherewith he loved us for when we were dead in sins have he quickened us together with christ by grace are ye saved god has set us free and have raised us up together and made us to sit together in heavenly places in christ jesus that in the ages to come this this age that we're living in that in the ages to come he might show the exceeding riches of his grace in his kindness towards us through jesus christ he has shown his goodness to us by revealing to us that we can be set free from that type of life from the from the world calvary paid the price for our sins we've been set free we've been set at liberty we're no longer under the bondage of this world we're no longer we don't have to listen to the devil we no longer have to live underneath the privileges that god has given us we've been set free it's it's it's it's recognizing it amen but we need to keep pursuing more truth for our personal life because we're on different levels of walking in whatever truth god has shown us and we need to continue walking in it john 8 verse 31 then jesus said to the jews which believed on him if i could say it like this if jesus was here he would he would speak to the christians which believed on him and what would he say he would say if you continue in my word then are you my disciples indeed so there's a continuation that is required and you shall know the truth and the truth shall make you free truth continues to liberate us i know we've been saved but all you've got to do is go through the course of the day and say oh wretched man that i am who's going to who's going to who's going to take care of me so we got to walk in the truth that god shows us every day because we're all longing to be liberated to have more freedom liberty is essential it's one of the building blocks of our nation was liberty there were certain individuals that didn't want to be tied to the rule of the british they wanted to be set free from their laws and they wanted to be liberated it was so important to them that they were willing to fight for liberty we remember patrick henry said give me liberty or give me death that's how important liberty was it's important to a christian our first uh amendment established liberty for us it was the freedom of speech religion press of the assembly together and the right to petition the government amen freedom to do that that's our first amendment i pledge allegiance to the flag of the united states of america and to the republic for which it stands one nation under god invisible with liberty and justice for all liberty is important it's important to the believer of course we know that the spirit of this age is trying to change our constitution they're trying to take our liberty away our rights away our guns away everything that it can take it away and bring us back into bondage there was a time that our colonies didn't want to pay taxes without representation of where that money was going oh what did our government who stood for that what did they end up turning into taking our money without us giving to say so where it's going and they said it was taxation without representation it's still tyranny no different it just it happened so slow the devil is trying to take our liberty our rights and to bring us under bondage we need to remember the words of our savior he that the son has set free is free indeed and to stand there in that liberty amen liberty is such an important element for the believer believers must have liberty to worship god from the dictates of their heart amen and that's in spirit and in truth believers must have liberty to hear the truth to to come to a place to where they know they're hearing the truth because it's the continuation of truth that continues to set us more free believers need liberty for god to move in their behalf without liberty change cannot take place i'm going to be read the next two scriptures were read in our men's meeting but they were already printed off the computer on my desk before the men's meeting i didn't want to say anything but turn with me to second corinthians chapter 3 verse 17. now the lord is that spirit and where the spirit of the lord is there is liberty we need the spirit of the lord but we all with open face beholding as in a glass the glory of the lord are changed into the same image from glory to glory even as the spirit even as by the spirit of the lord we as believers must give liberty to god to change us we're not going to be changed if we take liberty if we have liberty we got to what why is jesus knocking on the door here unless we open the door let him come in he's not going to change us so the the liberty god doesn't come where he's not welcomed that's why he inhabits the praises of his people that's why he kicks out the doubt and brings faith around him liberty is so god can work liberty is not so we can do what we want to do the holy spirit works through free more agency to bring the changes that need to take place in our life or that we long for liberty gives the believer power to change more into the image of god power to manifest christ power to cast out unclean spirits out of our lives power to become that's what liberty does he came to his own his own received and not but as many as received them gave him power to become the sons of god so it's it's through giving god liberty in our lives the word of god is not a law of do's and don'ts the word of god is simply liberty the word of god is simply our liberty and and and it's it's hard to comprehend it but it's the truth that sets us free that liberates us truth leads us to true freedom james chapter 1 verse 25 but whosoever looketh into the perfect law of liberty and continueth therein he being not a forgetful hearer but a doer of the work this man is going to be blessed in his deed that's why we love the truth here it brings freedom give me liberty or give me death luke chapter 10 verse 17. so here the the 70 were sent out and they returned again with joy saying lord even the devils are subject unto us through thy name notice it's through jesus that we get everything we need and jesus said unto them i beheld satan as lightning falling from heaven all through the name of jesus all we need is faith in jesus that's all we need we don't need anything else it's us and him it's do not put the responsibility on 15 other people three other people two other people one other people it's you and jesus if i blame my wife for something then i could i could all i have to do is i don't have to take responsibility the tendency that we have is to feel that we are put in a box because of a situation and you and god are a majority you take your liberty in christ that's all you need and we'll you're going to understand more as we're going on because because liberty is not for us to do what we feel to do that's not what liberty is for liberty is to do what god wants us to do that's what liberty's given to us for most everyone that is alive wants liberty to do what they want to do but it comes with a responsibility liberty without the responsibility of respect to god's word is the same thing as power without character it's satanic that's that's how dangerous liberty is when it's not in control by the holy ghost we've all seen children when they don't get what they want at home they'll begin to manipulate well bobby's parents let them watch anything they want to on tv why can't we well the last place i work they let me take as many breaks as i want well brother so-and-so lets his kids brother so-and-so lets his church brother so-and-so lets his wife they can wear see people want liberty to do what they want to do but just doing what you want to do doesn't make it right everyone wants more liberty to do what they want to do lucifer had liberty to do what he wanted we don't know how many years lucifer did the right thing he was a perfect angel he was absolutely perfect and he he he got the whole church in heaven to be in perfect harmony pointing all of them to that that jesus was god the only god there was nothing in there about a possibility of me i mean he was a perfect angel using his liberty to do what god wanted him to do until until he used his liberty to do what he wanted to do and then it became dangerous one day jealousy set in i want to be like the most high i want to exalt my throne above the stars of god i want to ascend to the heights of the clouds i want to sit on the mountain of the congregation he mixed what he was doing with his will and his agenda liberty is dangerous he took his liberty and little by little he convinced a third of heaven to start following their own will why stay in heaven and have to do what god wants you to do when you can just do what you want to do man that was enticing he took his liberty and used it for himself liberty without doing god's will is still satanic it's the same thing as having power without character in the message things that are to be brother and says but when you come to a church into a church usually certainly a spiritual congregation it seems like there is you feel more at liberty like there's something the presence of the lord the presence of god is there you know it seems to be different because we're the spirit of the lord as there is liberty i've had so many ministers talk about the liberty and the love of god that they feel in this church for as many years as we've had a church and the way this atmosphere is created is very simple it's keeping god first keeping the flesh out keeping the will of men you cannot have a man run the church it's got to be the holy ghost and well if just one child acting wrong after a service is done can affect the next service god god is sensitive and and we've all been given a liberty and that liberty needs to be used only to serve god to do his will liberty is very dangerous in the hands of a carnal mind galatians 5 13 says for brethren you have been called unto liberty only use not liberty for an occasion to the flesh well then what in the world i do with it but by love serve one another that's what liberty's been given for so there's a wrong way to use liberty if you're going to use liberty that's been given to you to exalt yourself you're wrong any occasion to exalt yourself pride reputation your image you're absolutely 100 percent wrong when god gives you liberty by love serve the person serve them that's what the scripture tells us for all the laws fulfilled in one word even this that thou shall love thy neighbor as thyself so we've been given liberty to serve amen that's it the liberty from almighty god we're the spirit of the lord as there is liberty we've been given that liberty to serve amen to serve others it's not about us anymore it's not about us getting to do what we want to do it's about doing his will god gives us liberty to do his will because we've been given liberty do what we want doesn't mean we can do what we want we've been given when we've been given liberty always love all we serve always give always esteem others better than yourself always do the will of god amen if we could say at least brother adam said mission work is always in the will of god take your liberty [Laughter] do a missionary word well he didn't tell me where to go well just start walking go ye into all the earth right we got scripture always say something take your liberty when you got an opportunity to say something about somebody take your liberty to always say something good not your liberty well this is my opinion about the guy about the girl about the family about the child no your liberty is to say something good in the message adoption brother branham says oh jesus was training 12 men and those 12 men was to take the gospel to the world but jesus said for thy sake i sanctify myself for i'm sorry for their sake i sanctify myself and he's referring to um i believe saint john chapter 17 continuing the quote make and here's brother bram talking to us make yourself for your neighbor's sake for for somebody else's sake don't use your liberty for a cloak said paul but sanctify yourself behave yourself in the neighborhood like a real christian ought to let your communications be if you meet your enemy sanctify yourself for his sake not knowing what you might do see this the liberty that god has given us is for others it's not for ourselves satan is the only one that offers you liberty to do what you want to do that's not what god gives us liberty for we often have liberty to do what we want to do but it doesn't mean for us to go do what we want to do with it there's such a responsibility that comes with that lord what do you want me to do what do you how do you want me to do it lord james chapter 4 13. we've read this many times but just look about in in the light of of liberty here go to now ye that say today or tomorrow we're going to go into such a city and continue there a year and buy and sell and get gain whereas you know not with the tomorrow what shall be on the moral for what is your life it's even a vapor that appears for a little time and then vanished away for that ye ought to say it if the lord will we shall live we shall do this well that's the way it should be when you have liberty in church it's the same thing but he says now you're rejoicing you're you're but you rejoice in your boostings all such rejoicing is evil so you can take your liberty and rejoice with your liberty and it be absolutely wrong therefore to him that knoweth to do good and doeth it not to him that is sin even though jesus says set us free he has placed a yoke on us christians have a yoke we just can't do whatever we want matthew chapter 11 verse 28 come unto me all ye that labor and are heavy laden and i will give you rest take my yoke upon you and he said learn of me for i'm meek and lowly in heart you shall find rest for your souls for my yoke is easy and my burden is light so when he gives us liberty um we it doesn't mean we can do what we want to do because we still have a yoke it's it's not the yoke of the devil every time he tricks us into something he just drags us through the mud we pay for it dearly but we're told jesus is telling here to take god's joke it's a collar it's a harness it's it's being joined together with christ amen it's being coupled to him whatever the word says we just do it whatever he tells us to do however he tells us to serve we just do it that's what it means to be yoked we're not at liberty to do what we want to do anymore turn with me if you would to romans chapter 6. we've been set free but not just to do whatever we want right amen we've been set free to be a servant of christ romans chapter 6 verse 24 when he were the servants of sin okay out in the world do you know you were free from righteousness you didn't have to listen to anybody you could just do whatever you wanted to do because you're out in the world you were free i don't want to go to church and get tied down right you know how it was what fruit had ye then in those things where of your are now ashamed yeah every one of us are ashamed of the things that we did when we were serving sin or serving ourselves for the end of those things is death but now being made free from sin jesus set us free we've become now servants to god and you have your fruit unto holiness and to everlasting life so if i understand the scriptures we don't have liberty just to do what our whatever we want to do so when god says take your liberty what is he really offering you he's offering you an opportunity to do what he wants you to do amen that's right nothing more right nothing less it's it's a fearful thing christ is our example of liberty amen how come it's so quiet here turn with me if you would to philippians chapter 2. jesus took upon himself the father's yoke leaving us an example to take christ's yoke because he said take my yoke upon you so here it is verse 3 let nothing be done through strife or vain glory but in lowliness of mind let each esteem the other better than themselves when is the last time you esteem somebody better than you okay okay how about this question now when was the last time you wish somebody esteemed you see the difference right okay look not every man on his own things his own agenda this is what i want to accomplish but every man also on the things of others let this mind be in you which was also in christ jesus who being in the form of god thought it not robbery to be equal god or what yoked with god he was robbery to be connected to what the father's will was amen it shouldn't be robbery for us to be connected to christ what christ wants us to do but made himself of no i just want to say this here he was in the garden and and he wanted liberty to not go to calvary amen and he had liberty not to go to calvary he could call for allegiance of angels if he wanted to but he surrendered he took the liberty that god gave him he surrendered his wealth not my will but your will be done father so he made himself of no reputation he took upon him the form of a servant and was made in the likeness of men and being found in fashion as a man he humbled himself and he became obedient so he was obedient but now he became obedient unto death and then he stretches it even to the death of the cross so i'm saying here we constantly have liberty but what do we do with it are we want liberty to do more what we want are we looking for liberty to serve god to do what he's called us to do very powerful to me it was powerful brother brahms speaking of satan's temptation to get jesus to take the kingdoms of the world without going to the cross here in a message how can i overcome he said if he did we'd be lost he could have took the kingdom he was tempted to do it now death is a hard thing he was tempted to take his liberty and be the king of the earth without the cross but if he did his subjects would have died and satan would have gladly made that proposition with him see satan wants us to take our liberty to do what we want to do because when that happens subjects are going to die because we're we're we're made we're always bearing about in our body the dying of the lord jesus why that the life of christ may be manifest that the will of god could be done and others could be helped and served it's no different liberty is not for our flesh it's to do the will of god that's what liberty's for if we want to take his yoke upon us we got to be joined to everything that this word says everything that god wants us to do where he was a servant we're become a servant where he loved we love where he forgave we forgive where he lay down his life we lay down our life where he became obedient we become obedient that's what the liberty is for because before you were in the liberty of god you couldn't do that you didn't want to do it you wanted to be number one you wouldn't settle for number two we become completely joined to christ the word that's the true liberty that god wants us to take so when we take our liberty we take our liberty in christ to do his will i'm going to go through a few scriptures here james chapter 1 verse 1 james a servant of god and of the lord jesus christ to the 12 tribes which are scattered abroad so here's james he's a servant he's a servant of god but he's a servant to others when we think about servants of god we just think about oh wow there's a servant of god wow look god's using them what we ought to be thinking about is if we're a servant of god who are we serving here here james was a servant to the 12 tribes that means he was serving the 12 tribes he wasn't just writing them a letter he was serving them he wasn't just preaching them a sermon amen but he was servant jude chapter 1 verse 1 jude the servant of jesus christ and the brother of james to what to them that are sanctified by god the father and preserving christ jesus in jesus christ and called so here he is jude is a servant he takes his liberty unto others to them that are sanctified those that are walking with christ ii peter chapter one verse one simon peter a servant and an apostle of jesus christ another servant to who to god to them that have obtained like precious faith with us through the righteousness of god and our savior jesus christ see we want to correlate being a servant to others liberty to help others that's what we've been given it for not for ourselves many places paul refers to himself as as as a servant not just of god but unto others first corinthians chapter 9 verse 19. if you want to write it down for though i be free from all men yet have i made myself a servant unto all that i might gain the more so here he was he's been set free he got clobbered on the way on the road to damascus god got his attention got kicked off his eye a horse a man laid his hands on him he received his sight received the holy ghost he was free he was free but now he took the liberty that he had and he subjected himself to the will of god amen and he became a servant to all that he might gain some verse 22 to the week became i is weak that i might gain the weak i made all things to all men that i might by all means save some you're not going to save everybody but if you subject if you take the liberty that god's given you and you serve others you will win some in the message a prisoner brother brahm says oh god sometimes sometimes god sometimes takes his people out like that and shaves a few of their own wills off shows them that they can't do just whatever they want to do you know what i mean they're not in liberty to do what they want to do before they could just they could come i said before they could come into the full power and be a love slave to christ they had to be shaved off and then presented sometimes he takes them to the desert to do that to shave them all sometimes we forget that the liberty that god has given us is not to be used for an occasion for our flesh you know the thing is the devil he's not going to blatantly put it right in front of us he's going to like kind of mix it in he's going to mix it in so you can't see it when motives get mixed objectives get mixed we can miss the purity of serving christ first corinthians chapter 6 verse 19 what know ye not that that your body is the temple of the holy ghost which is in you which you have of god and you are not your own amen for you've been bought with a price when you think about that if i said i bought your car and i handed you the money that you wanted for your car and i drive the car away get the title you got the money you put it in the bank you can't change your mind you can't come over my house with the second set of keys that you didn't give me and take the car take the liberty you've been bought it's been bought we don't have liberty to do what we want to do that is so antichrist god's given us liberty to serve him amen for your bought with the price therefore glorify god in your body and your spirit which are god's we're all all of us here our servants of christ amen we've been called at liberty to what to serve one another no things don't have to be perfect to do that things don't have to be perfect with one another things don't have to be perfect with you i'll tell you how many times have we washed one another's feet and we haven't been perfect we still wash feet our liberty is to serve if we could just see the we have so much liberty here so much liberty to serve if we want liberty for something different than that it's probably not the place to be where the spirit of the lord is there's liberty what does christ do he serves every one of us we get up in the morning we say god thank you for this day his mercies are new each day we need mercies every day from god we need his grace we we need him he serves us it doesn't do anything god is good he doesn't do anything ill that's why love worketh no ill to its neighbors no matter if we think they deserve it or not maybe they do deserve it but you know what so do i so do you we all deserve it we all deserve ill we all deserve to die we all deserve not to have the grace of god but god has called us to liberty to serve one another amen to serve one another find something somehow some way to serve someone amen take his yoke the word it's your absolute let it teach you how to serve because i tell you what i feel we need some learning how to serve i'm not pointing any fingers but i'm just being honest with you um how many uh let me see how many how many likes eggs all right which way do you like your eggs scrambled yeah good good yes boiled that's a good one that's a good one dry okay yeah the runny can kind of be gooey so so now let me just say like this you said you like them scrambled right what if i gave it to you gooey what if i give it to you over easy okay so now we're just take one of us and one of us likes the egg just like this after a while it's just like i get i'm getting tired of eggs i think my daughter took a chef class and she learned that there was over 100 ways to cook an egg which i cannot believe it there's a hundred ways to cook an egg because i'm just one you know two or three at the most with me you know the thing is we think what can i do to serve i just i'm running out of things to do to serve that's why i think we need to spend time studying the word with this motive lord show me how i can serve the body show me how i can serve because there are other ways ii timothy chapter 2 verse 24 second timothy chapter 2 verse 24 and the servant of god must not strive but be gentle unto all men an apt to teach patient i'll say like this every parent needs somehow has to have some ability to teach their child so everybody can do this we can learn how to help one another in meekness instructing those that oppose themselves if god pre-eventually give them repentance to acknowledging of the truth that there may be recover themselves out of the snare of the devil who have taken them captive at his his will so god wants us to take his yoke upon us and learn of him learn how we can take this great liberty that we have and not just miss church where we want to miss church not just not pay any offering because we don't feel like paying any offerings did you know august was the first month that we didn't have enough money to pay rent did you know we only got a hundred dollar off 100 came in for brother when brother aaron was here with all the services did you know we didn't have one dollar come in that back for brother george smith we take our liberty and we do what we want but the liberty that god has given us is to do his will amen so it's something that we should think about this great liberty that god's given us is to serve him and and we just spend some time lord show me teach me show me now i wanna i wanna help my body i wanna help my brother wanna help my sister we had one brother in the church give an offering straight to brother george smith but nothing came into the box but we still have to give out the money right we sell the plane tickets and and those things and we don't pump for money here but i'm just being honest with you it's part of business i mean the prophet said no service is complete without an offering and it just is something to pray about something to pray about are you with me god's given us liberty for what to serve one another eternal life is living for you talk about liberty eternal life is liberty to serve one another now even though that we've been set free by the blood of christ and by the word of god satan will not stop trying to bring us back into bondage that's true he will keep enticing us and he'll keep trying to give us what our flesh wants because what we want in our flesh brings us into bondage saint wants you to use your liberty for your flesh your personal agenda your purposes your reputation anything that isn't of god is going to bring us back into bondage amen how do people backslide how do people lose their joy how do people get away from god god never leaves anybody everybody leaves god and we find god where we go where we left him the prophet taught us galatians chapter 5 verse 1 stand fast therefore in the liberty where we're with christ have made us free amen and be not uh entangled again with the yoke abundance that's telling me that i can get in bondage again we need to take the the liberty that god has given us and put on the whole armor of god that we may be able to stand against the wiles of the devil because he's constantly working through this laodicea spirit to keep giving us what we want to keep taking liberty in our flesh when the children of israel were liberated and set free came out of egypt and they were dancing you know what they did they took their liberty to do their own will they began to murmur complain they wanted different leadership and they took liberty they talked about it and it spread like a poison like a cancer they took the liberty that god had given them and said i don't need to really press into the promised land i'm satisfied with just going to church and god said you need to continue in the word you got to take possession you shall know the truth and the truth shall make you free i'm looking for more freedom in myself i hate this old man and i mean that he may think i'm saying oh man cause i'm an old man which is you know probably true but it's still an old man at any age right it's an old man to any age uh he's he needs to die daily there's no remedy that you know you kill him once and you don't have to worry about in the rest of your christian walk he gets up every day hoping to get the edge on you all right in the message greatest bet over fault brother brandon said the greatest battle ever fault she is going on right now going on right in here now yes sir between life and death between sickness and health between faith and doubt all my oh my between liberty and bondage he said the battle is on shine your spear soldiers polish your armor god is getting his soldiers ready amen god anoints his army so we're in a battle and the devil is going to constantly be trying to get you your mind off of taking the liberty that you have to serve one another he's going to try to get you anytime that you can judge somebody oh you're no longer serving you become a judge so he's won the victory there you're not going to serve anybody when you're judging him when you've been given liberty always use it to serve serve the one who's given you the liberty if your boss gives you a bonus gives you a raise serve them a little bit more be grateful show it god gives you liberty serve them take the liberty that god has given you and serve him with it don't do what satan did he used his liberty for himself i will don't use your liberty for an opportunity just to keep building your life your own life let god build your life you just do what he told you he told you to seek first the kingdom and his righteousness and he'll do all the building he'll build your life he'll add it one thing at a time we always want liberty to do what we want but sometimes it disagrees with the liberty that somebody else wants right everybody wants liberty to do what they want but sometimes the liberty they want disagrees with the liberty that somebody else wants and this would be a typical thing in the marriage well i think well i think well i wear the pants and whatever you take the uh the arab nations they're always fighting against one another they want liberty to do what they want but if it disagrees with them they'll fight for it and this is the the the the scary thing about wanting liberty it may disagree with somebody else's liberty and then what do you got but if you take the liberty that god's given you and serve by love serve one another you'll never be lacking for accomplishment you'll never be lacking for accomplishment because you've got your agenda out of there it's all about god's agenda but when there's when there's a your liberty and somebody else's liberty there's a there's a disagreement that's why we have church order right god is not the altar of confusion that's why the bible says the spirit of the prophets is subject to the prophets that's why we must endeavor to keep the unity of the spirit and the bond of peace there's one body one spirit even as you're called into one hope if you're calling one lord one faith one so there needs to be unity where the spirit of the lord is there is liberty there's freedom and it's not to do what we want but it's simply to do what he wants us to do now here's the problem everybody that wants liberty thinks that what they're wanting is exactly what god wants the music you listen to you think that's the music god likes in reality every man's right in his own eyes so we can't go by that if we feel something should be different we pray that's always a powerful weapon we pray we look at we all think we none of us want sickness in our church but we can't force it god to change it we can't we can't demand it from god all we do is we we pray to god we take our position in the word we lay claims promises but you can't force healing so why do you think you can force anything else you understand i'm saying you've got to place things in the hands of god but now if you want to see any what can you do well you could just keep praying keep fasting keep calling on god keep believing keep trusting the same is for every other need in the church that's how you accomplish seeing god having his way in the church in the message questions and answers number three the question came what does paul mean by freedom and liberty in christ what way is freedom from law brother bran says well you're not bound by the law say for instance here's the same thing i'll explain it in the natural way quickly for instance out here it says go down the street 30 miles per hour is all the faster you can go alright now if i go down the street 40 miles per hour i'm condemned by the law he says i'm condemned by the law but if i go down the street just 30 miles an hour i'm not under the law see that's freedom in christ the same thing you still have to do what the word says it's just you're not condemned he says you're not bound by the law as long as i as i don't steal as i don't lie smoke commit adultery any of these things i'm ba i'm not bound by no law see i'm free from the law i'm in christ well i used to hear brother i don't i i don't know where it came from and i i don't know if it it came from brother ray lanning or not but i remember him years ago he would say i smoke all that i want i drink all that i want he says i just don't want to so i don't do it and if you abide by the word you're in the perfect law of liberty galatians 5 verse 22 we're closing very quickly galatians 5 22 but the fruit of the spirit is love joy peace longsuffering gentleness goodness faith meekness temperance look at this against such there is no law when you are in the spirit when you are in the when you have the liberty to love your enemy to to be long-suffering to be to be gentle to be good and you abide in that there is no law against you but as soon as you step out i don't i'm not gonna love him i'm not gonna i don't need to be long suffering now that law is over you and you're condemned liberty has been given to us to stay within the word not to do what we want to do and say this is the reason for it that's not true liberty because he that is that the son is set free he's really free indeed he can love his enemy he's not tied down by some hatred are you with me all right this is the last quote and i'm stopping this is in the mighty conquer and brother graham's talking about arnold van winkled remember there that the whole switzerland was being under attacked and they said arnold von winkle red sorry i can't pronounce his name what can you do against such a great host coming on he said just beyond the mountains i've kissed goodbye my wife my three children and there's a little white house and they're standing in the door to watch me come home but said i'll never see them again in this earth for today i give my life for switzerland and it's right they said what will you do mr arnold von wrinklered kind of like spoil the story because i don't want to say his name so you just have to bear with me i should just call mr arnold he said you just follow me and whatever you've got to fight with fight with all that's in you and they said what will you do now he had liberty he had liberty to do what he wanted to do and he threw down what he had in his hand and he seen the great army coming on and he looked it all over until he found the very thickest of spears and as the story goes he raised his hands and took right towards the midst of the spear screaming make way for liberty and he screamed again make way for liberty and he ran into those hundred spears to catch him and he threw his uh his arms and got all a whole armload of them and plunged them into his chest such a display of heroism it routed the army and those little swiss men with their sticks and stones and sickle blades routed that army out of their territory and they haven't had a war since make way for liberty do you want liberty more liberty serve give that will bring the presence of god anybody can sit back and say i'm not doing it i'm not arnold but you we're we're we are sons and daughters we're the priest of god we've been chosen we're elected yes you can take differences things that are wrong bring it in your bosom carry it to god in prayer be strong in faith believe for god to move to have his liberty here we want him to have his liberty i know how i can mess up a life i've done it many times all of us have all of us had messed up lights before we came to christ and we've all messed up afterwards with our liberty i don't like my liberty i i'm a dumb sheep i need my shepherd i need jesus amen let's stand together thank you for your patience all right maybe we'll just go to the lord in prayer every head bowed i'm gonna close my eyes and i just want you to make this between you and him and not to be thinking this is brother john talking right now but maybe you want to take the liberty that god has given you and you want to separate all what you want and only do what the lord wants you to do that's your heart's desire i want you to to believe it now as we go to him in prayer our heavenly father we're so grateful that you took the liberty that you had to do the father's will and you've asked us to take your yoke up upon us to follow in your steps and to serve one another and lord you've seen the hands that were raised in our heart the desires that that spoke out when the question went out that we want to take the liberty that you've given us and to do your will father where we've come short where we have failed to use that liberty for you we are sorry we asked that you would not just only cleanse us and wash us but lord that you'd give us that power not to entertain temptations in the future lord but god as you've given us so many opportunities every time we come to church and we intermingle with one another and fellowship and and and have uh uh the word minister to us may we just take these precious words that you have placed now in our heart we hide them and lord may we just serve one another now may we may we do our part lord to create such an atmosphere here that if it only affects one god use us to affect that one but lord we are a believing church that's looking for you to do mighty things in our church lord lord things that we haven't experienced before because you promised you still are a god that does exceed the above all that we ask or even think lord we know that if we just humble ourselves to you you said you would just you would exalt this church in due time lord we place ourselves in your hands lord use every one of us lord let there not be any big eyes or little hues and any of our thoughts about the

we're all one body we're on the we're all children of the living god we all are called to serve one another help us to remember how important that is lord i pray that you would bless each and every one with the desire of their heart lord we commit ourselves to you take this word now and make it live inside of us we pray we give you the glory for all these things lord we pray in jesus precious
