and me just two gathered in his name and God promised to come and meet us and what a blessing that is and especially um remember in the ministry of Jesus as it got closer to the end many left true but those that were ordained remained and I'm just thankful that he put within us not just us but those that are us even though they're not here that he put something within us that we will remain no matter what and we just appreciate all of you here today uh coming to hear the word of the Lord and um I told brother Aaron in the back I said if it was just me and you I am like I I want what you got for us tonight and I'm just thankful you know I I I they come out to visit the family you know but in my in the prayer room as I was praying I was praying Lord you the spiritual is what you've got in mind and I believe that that God has an important word for us that goes far beyond the natural of of of a family so we're we're thankful that God has that for us and we appreciate uh brother Aaron appreciate the whole family and uh Cheryl and an are are dealing with a a a a goat that's dying right now I don't know anything more than that but if you just remember them in prayer and as brother Ron said to to remember those that are not here those that are are live streaming those that are vacation there's a family the wednes are are sick again so let's remember them um but I believe there's enough of us to pull the word out of brother Aaron amen amen how many's been praying for the service amen that that's it let's just welcome brother Aaron now he's going to have to leave kind of quick uh because they're going they're leaving to go up North and we just we want you to better get there as quick as you can just so you know amen let's just sing only believe as our brother comes to give us the word of life oh only believe only believe all things are possible only believe ohly [Music] all things are possible only be saying Lord I believe and Lord I believe Lord I believe all things are possible Lord I believe Lord I believe Lord I believe all things are possible Lord I believe amen praise the Lord so good to be in the house of the Lord this evening you could just take your Bibles we'll be reading out of numbers 23 and just taking one verse there verse 19 happy to be here and small crowds don't intimidate me and I know it's in the the DNA of this church to start with nothing and uh and just watch the Lord grow it over these many years and uh we've had a similar experience ourselves start starting a church from scratch and so I believe God's always faithful to meet us and truly if just one person is impacted by the word every effort has been worth it and so I do want to full disclosure my wife picked out my tithe this evening from among all of brother John's ties in his collection and uh we may have to ceremony burn it Friday night uh as this is burnt orange uh and so go Blue to anybody who's wondering why in the world I'm wearing this tie on the eve of a game against University of Texas but it was her choice uh I think mishy may be a little colorblind but we love you all like family it's so good to be here and as we have opportunity to minister Lord willing Sunday morning and' be wonderful if we just met in the air and didn't have to worry about it but if we are still here and God's will we'll be ministering so we'll send we'll just spend more time and greetings on Sund morning numbers 23: 19 it says God is not a man that he should lie neither the son of man that he should repent hath he said and shall he not do it or hath he spoken and shall not make it good amen if we could just bow our heads together now gracious Heavenly Father tonight as we have this opportunity to be together there's certainly uh more than enough for the mathematical requirement of two or three and Lord I do believe that we've gathered in your name in that character with this expectation and Lord You've blessed us with your presence through this song service you've also said that you inhabit the Praises of your people so Lord there have been Praises that have been lifted up and Lord we fear your name so we know that your angels are en kempt about us so father we're certain tonight that there's more present than we see and that there's things that are much more significant than what we could count or what we could perceive with our feelings Lord I pray tonight that you take this word that we've already read and bless it take those things which are upon our heart Lord make them alive to us as they are ministered make them alive To Us by your spirit as only you can we commit all things to you now in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen amen you could be seated my my title tonight is God is not a grandpa and if uh if anyone thinks that this might be some sort of statement in the presence of the grandpa to my children uh it is not you'll understand just exactly uh where we're coming from as we continue but something I've just been studying on something that I've been uh prepared to minister on at home and coming here it's like home so I'm ministering something here I haven't ministered back at home and uh just as long as you don't push it out on social media they might not be any the wiser uh By Me ministering it here but the title in is uh this would be a part one of God is not a grandpa and uh this other slide I have here is um you may not be able to see it but there's a title of an article here that says God has no grandsons and it's exclamation point you'll find in the story itself that it's kind of bolded and made uh uh very profound and you this is an article written by David dupi in the Full Gospel men's voice it's in July August of 1960 the article is just two pages long but here's just a a little scan of it so you can see it and I'll just briefly condensed the article the article he says he was laying in bed it was early in the morning and a loud and clear voice was ringing in his head God has no grandsons and he said it just kept uh very clearly and he was inspired to check that with the scripture and he went to Romans 8:14 and he went to 1 John 3:2 he went to Galatians 4 4-7 and he's reading everywhere where it's God is a father and we are his sons and we are the children of God and then he went to the Old Testament he searched through and he was just going through his Bible uh uh anywhere that he could find some sort of connection between God and a grandson and he concluded according to the Bible God is nobody's grandfather and he made the he wrote this in this article he said it was about 5: in the morning I switched off the light and put on my thinking cap what have I discovered nothing new I always knew God is our father in Heaven he is the father of all believers and Believers are in Christ Believers in Christ are called the sons of God so what I have only found a new way of saying an old truth God is nobody's grandfather only father and I know as I read this is very familiar to all of us and we know that brother brandham gave Brother David duplicity uh credit often when he quoted it but God brother brandham quoted this and referenced it many times he said God has no grandchildren God has no Pentecostal grandchildren and he often referred back to Brother David D as saying it and brother brandom mentioning it as frequently as he has and and using it in the context that he did I think it's a statement that's worth considering and brother brandom uses it to express the truth that God's seed are born directly from God that if you're going to be a seed of God you don't come through some other channel you come directly from God and that to be related to God that there's only one relationship and that's of a father to a son so you are if you're a related to God you're a direct descendant from God there's no intermediary God did not birth the son and then that son birthed the son and then God have some sort of loyalty or allegiance to it uh by virtue of the children giving birth but rather brother brandom shows over and over again that in order to be related to God you must be a child of God and if he has no grandsons he has no cousins or nephews or anything else you must be directly uh come you must directly come from God and I was thinking of I'm kind of maybe inverting in something and looking at it from this standpoint laying a foundation for Sunday morning but I think it's a a profound and necessary truth that's kind of hidden in something very simple as Brother David concluded he just says well I I've just learned a new way of saying an old truth and truly it is kind of just a it's nothing new in the Bible it wasn't a real profound Revelation but he just found a unique way to express something that we had always known and in the article he goes on to tell a story of how he sat next to a Catholic priest and he used this particular um Revelation to him or quickening to him that God has no grandsons to really challenge this priest's notion of Salvation and relationship so he saw a deeper meaning and connection with It ultimately but I want us as Believers to ponder the implications of the truth that God is not a grandpa now some of you may say grandpa or Grandpa or gr burger or something you might have some name Papa Opa different things that you might use for your grandparents uh but I'm just using Grandpa God is not a grandpa so think of this now as we go through some scriptures and just Fellowship on this for a little bit and I will I can testify that I am not abbreviating anything we're ministering tonight for the sake of our drive that we have later on I feel that the word should have preeminence but it is if it is brief it's only that we've laid the necessary Foundation to continue on Sunday morning in Hosea 11: 8 and9 God is speaking how shall I give thee up Ephraim how shall I deliver thee Israel how shall I make thee as adma how shall I set thee as zeum my heart is turned within me my repenting are kindled together these are pretty uh outstanding statements and he says I will not execute the fierceness of my anger I will not return to destroy Ephraim for I am God and not man the Holy One in the midst of thee and I will not enter into the City and God is uh raising these questions how can I give the up how can I how shall I deliver you I won't make you by like this or how can I make you like that my heart's turned my repenting are kindled together and it seems like maybe the musings or the thoughts or the emotions of a man but he says I will not destroy and in doing so he says my my wrath is kindled within me but I'm not going to destroy and so he makes this statement I think to kind of suggest that if I was man I could be given to this if I if I was a jealous person after a human sort I may not be able to control myself he says I am God and not man and I think that's a good place to start in thinking about the fact that God is not a grandpa is starting with the fact that he is God he's the Holy One and he's not man and man is a created being and he's created with a a body and we could say that's the flesh and blood it's the the physical part and he has a spirit that's the the mental and the intellectual and the emotional part and then he has a soul and though we see God expressed in a Triune way and we can see God manifested in threes perfected in threes uh God is not three in that he has a body spirit and soul God is not man and man is I want to make this very clear and it may seem to be the obvious and so this isn't uh a new truth but maybe just a new way of expressing an old truth but man is Humanity solely and so he has a distinct way of feeling he has a distinct way of thinking and perceiving and observing things and calculating things and in that he has a certain way of acting and God is making that distinction I I won't destroy Ephraim uh because I'm not man I'm God and and he's saying I want to be measured by something different than just the way a man would act in James chapter 5:1 17 it speaks of Elijah he says Elias was a man subject to like passions as we are and he prayed earnestly that it might not rain and it rained on on the Earth by the space of three years and six months and it's talking about the fervent prayer of a righteous man availeth much and there was some belief amongst the Jews that perhaps Elijah was not man that he was somehow a different being or something elevated or something greater and so he's saying that Elijah as a man just like you I prayed and that fervent prayer and righteous man availed much and it's this phrase subject to like passions as we are that I want to use to cause us to think a little bit about the fact that we are human we're man when it says subject to like passions as we are let's not just think of men When God says I'm not a man we're not just thinking male but we're thinking Humanity I'm not human and Elijah was like a man both in mind and body just like anybody else hey had thoughts like all people have thoughts he had sicknesses and weaknesses and things in his flesh like we all do he had physical pain he had hunger he was weary in his flesh he also experienced emotional pain and anxiety he comes to a place in his life where he says it is enough and he wanted to die requested to die so we could say that even in an emotional sense he's subject to these thoughts of ending his life and uh uh emotional exhausting because these are the passions that humans experience and then it says of Jesus Christ in Hebrews 4:15 for we have not a high priest which cannot be touched with the fing of our infirmities but was in all points tempted like as we are yet without sin and this brings Christ uh God in relation to man through Christ where in Christ as the Son of God is now a high priest who can be touched by this phrase the feeling of our infirmities in other words he has experienced some of these same Passions that we experienced he's felt pain he's felt hunger he's been through things that provoked emotions that humans experience in a way that God himself cannot experience them even as it says here he was tempted like as we are but yet without without sin though he was subject to the same passions of hunger and weariness and emotional uh pain and rejection he did not uh sin in the Sin of impatience or the sin of unbelief or the sin of fear but he was yet human and as humans we have infirmities as humans we have temptations as humans we have passions in 1 Corinthians chapter 2: 11 Paul is this is a a really neat chapter to read together he says but for what man knoweth the things of man say the spirit of man which is in him in the 23 years I've been ministering here I've probably used this example maybe 23 times but uh many times we look at our dogs or we look at our pets and we just can't get our heads around the fact why are they acting the way that they're acting uh because we don't have the spirit of a dog inside of us to get in the side of a dog's head and relate to why they do the things that they do but yet another dog may look at Sophie and say Sophie I'm with you I love what you're doing there I would do the same thing if I had the opportunity and they kind of Nod or bark knowingly at one another because the dogs get it and what Paul is saying is that we know the things of man and we can relate to Man by the Spirit of man that is in Us in other words James is even appealing to that he says Elijah was a man just like us and subject to like passions like us so we can get Elijah Elijah could relate to us we should be able to relate to Elijah but he says even so the things of God knoweth no man but the spirit of God so he's making this distinction and dividing between the spirit of man which knows Humanity which knows flesh knows blood know knows the the mind of man and the thoughts of man when someone comes to you and says I'm I'm feeling down today you can immediately begin to relate in some way in your life to what it's like to feel down if somebody says man I'm so excited it's like Christmas morning even if you never celebrated Christmas or know what a Christmas morning's like you know uh the emotions that they're trying to conjure up or at least express to you because those are things that just relate to man but Paul is drawing this dividing line saying that but you can't know the nature of God through the nature of man he even go so far as to say that the natural man is enmity with God and the human mind is opposed to God so God is distinct in himself he is a being unto himself and we cannot know him just by relating solely to human characteristics now in Acts chapter 14 verses 11 to 18 this is um a little bit not really maybe a lengthy reading but it's a longer story that uh I'm only just trying to pull a couple things out of and it says and when the people saw what Paul had done they lifted up their voice is saying in the speech Loni uh lonia they're they're now they've seen these Miracles they say the the gods are come down to us in the likeness of men now notice just what these Heathen or these Idol worshippers responses were their response was to something Supernatural something Beyond themselves and so they I want you to kind of catch this human instinct because even though we may not be Idol worshippers they're still kind of this is the human thought the gods are come down and now are manifesting themselves in men and so they said they called Barnabas Jupiter and Paul mercurius because he was the chief speaker so they're seeing that these are Jupiter and Mercury that are come down in the flesh then the priest of Jupiter which was before their City brought oxen and garlands unto the gates and would have done sacrifices with the people which when the apostles barnabus and Paul heard of they rent their clothes and ran in among the people crying out and saying s why do ye these things we also are men of like passions with you so this phrase subject to like passions or we are men of like passions with you is to bring them down out of gods that have come down or out of deity that ought to be worshiped and to make this connection with them to say we are human just like you and in some ways it should be regarded that we are only human just like you and and maybe there's times you know maybe uh Eliza might have some Idols of hers when it comes to artist and it may seem to be a god of art or Preston may have some Idols when it comes to fishing a and it may be that they might be Gods to them and but yet we got to realize they're all human we should never Elevate somebody above somebody else we should never make somebody out to be uh more than who they are and not to elevate them to gods or idols and so Paul is saying we are humans just like you men of like passions we're not Gods we're not deity in some uh sense that we ought to be worshiped and things brought to us uh to honor us he says and we preach to you as these men that you should turn from these vanities unto the Living God turn from Jupiter turn from Mercury turn from these false idols and unto a living God which made Heaven and Earth and the Sea and all things that are therein when time pass suffered All Nations to walk in their own ways nevertheless he left not himself without witness in that he did good and gave us rain from heaven in fruitful Seasons filling our hearts with food and gladness so he's attributing even those things that we enjoy naturally as having come from God and with these sayings scarce restrained they the people that they had not done sacrifice unto them so if we're just focusing with us and again we're not going to have a lot of time so uh if if you're taking notes maybe that might be a good way pressing Eliza just use your pens and paper uh to to take notes and write these scriptures down and and not be distracted but these are things that we're wanting just to kind of catch the thought that as men we have human Tendencies we have human needs we have human wants we have ways that we conduct ourselves and each one of these scriptures has shown us that there's human passions there's human wants there's human perceptions there's human needs and God himself said I am God and not man so God is not like man despite any similarities uh that might be ascribed to him uh or there might be ways that he has manifested himself to where he seems humanlike or or there is ways that are attributes that God has as a father or God loves or God is jealous even though God may have certain things in a language we use to describe him God is not man he says of himself in Isaiah 55: 8 and9 for my thoughts are not your thoughts neither are your ways my ways saith the Lord uh brother Jonathan that's Emma's dad he said he sent me a a meme one time and it was two Cowboys around a campfire and the one Cowboy's kind of looking up and he says do You Hear What I Hear the other Cowboy said no I Hear What I Hear and in some ways this is kind of what God is saying but I would say it's much bigger than that and that he says you don't think like I think and he said well yeah I know your thoughts are not my thoughts you think your own thoughts and I I I have my own ways and you have your own ways but he said my thoughts are your not thought not your thoughts and my ways are not your ways in other words you're human and you behave in a human manner my ways are higher for as the heavens are higher than the earth so are my ways higher than your ways in my thoughts than your thoughts God is distinguishing among human emotions and his own emotions he's distinguishing among human processes and thoughts and perceptions from uh his own thoughts saying that you ought not to think and even as he says you ought not think like the godhead is liken under things that are fashioned by man and crafted by by human beings and so we shouldn't think God operates within the manner of man I I know for me one thing that became a tremendous victory in my life is to recognize just how subtly I took uh my experiences in being loved and my experiences in loving and quietly and subconsciously Associated that with the love that God had for me as if to say that all love is the same love and therefore I love somebody and I can mistreat them I've Been Loved by people who mistreated me and so you kind of build into love this tendency to be perverted or to be harsh or to be cruel or to be distant or to punish us it but God's love is not like our love God's thoughts are not like our thoughts God's ways are not like our ways I think in Hosea it's exactly what he's saying is my heart is turned within me my repenting are kindled together together I'm not going to execute my wrath and my anger and pour it out upon Ephraim because I'm not a man and that's what a man would do but I'm God and I won't do it and as we read in numbers 23: 19 just notice again how specifically this is to the difference between God and man God is not a man that he should lie neither the son of man that he should repent we find that God repents if the scriptures speak of God's repenting being kindled together God repented that he ever made man we recognize that it is not as a son of man or a human or a mere mortal that God would do so because God is not man that he would lie God is not the son of man that he would ever need to repent whatever he says he will do he does it and he if he's spoken he'll make it good is what uh balum is saying and what he is expressing and we've heard the phrase God is not man that he should lie we have the the principle let every man's word be a lied let God's word be the truth why because God is not man that he should lie we should think of it this way God does not operate like a man he's not subject to the same passions as a man he's not subject to the same instincts as a man is subject to them 1 Corinthians chap 2:14 having already read verse 11 it says but the natural man receiveth not the things of the spirit of God for they are foolishness unto him neither can he know them because they are spiritually discerned the things of God are not known by living a human experience we cannot even say well God is a father therefore I as a father can relate uh perfectly to God no we can't we can't say well God is a Creator so if you created something or you're an artist or you're a fabricator you can't then begin to uh uh lift yourself up to say oh I'm something like God is or discern the nature of God he can only be known through the spirit the natural man can not receive the things of God because they're foolishness to him even in the way that what man calls great God calls foolishness and what God calls great man thinks its foolishness so the things of God in many ways are beneath man he thinks himself better and higher than even these things because the natural man is not God and God is not a natural man in 1 Corinthians chapter 10: 12 13 and 14 he says wherefore let him that thinketh he standeth take ke lest he fall and then he uh there's this I would let me just back up and say we ought not to he says he that thinks he stands and so he's really maybe calling out the fact that you don't actually stand but if any man thinks he stands on his own accord his own effort his own discipline his own choices take heed lest you fall for if we stand we're standing in Christ if we stand it's by his grace and he says there hath no temptation taken you but such as common to man again I think this relates to we are subject to like passions as Paul and Barnabas out say said out loud uh to the people and uh be we have feelings of infirmities and we are tempted as mortal men and and we're subject to like passions as we are as uh James wrote so there's this I think this statement is in the same vein there's no temptation that you fight with that you wrestle with but such as common to man there are things that are common to man in other words it's commonly found among men we could actually go so far as to say then that there are things that are not only common to man but exclusive to man and then he says but God and I'd like for that just to kind of linger a little bit that there are things Temptations feelings passions desires thoughts ways that are common to man but God but God is different God is not like man that he should like God is not like man that he would be subject to these different Temptations and passions but he is faithful who will not suffer you to be temped above that you are able but will with the Temptation also make a way to escape that you may be able to Bear it and then this I would say a curious notation wherefore my dearly beloved flee from idolatry and there's a lot that could be said here but in the context of how he is saying this he that thinks he stands take heed lest he fall because you're tempted just like every other man no matter how righteous you may feel that you are no matter how disciplined you may be no matter how much you've claimed to uh avoid or uh not be uh fall to he's saying there's no temptation but has taken you but such as common to men all men are subject to passions subject to Temptation so he says my dearly beloved flee from idolatry flee from and and idolatry be turning something that is in fact not God into a God uh you you cannot turn God into an idol because he's the one true God you cannot worship God in spirit and in truth and that be idolatry you cannot worship uh God as he is and see him as he is and ascribe to him greatness and glory and that be idolatry but you can ascribe deity to inherently human characteristics and that be idolatry or you can also give ascribe uh deity to human in or you can ascribe human intellect and human emotions to God in that be idolatry and other words to justify your own anger or your own jealousy as a Godly jealousy or a godly Vengeance to act out in in some sort of fanaticism or some sort of emotion or even some intellect or some cold inform formal way and ascribe that to God idolatry can be on all those different spectrums where you either ascribe human traits and characteristics to God to deify the humanity or you bring God down into Humanity by saying that some human thought proc process or emotion is God but God is not a grandpa everything we've shared to this point has been to establish this distinction that there is God and then there is man so then now as we examine we've made this difference between God deity the Divine the Eternal Elohim the Holy One and Humanity man flesh son daughter mother Grandpa grandfather Grandma you name it anything that's Flesh and Blood God is not a grandpa brother Bram pointed to him many many times as Brother David duplicity said he has no grandsons and let me say something that might shock you nor does he want them this may seem and I would say in general this is in congruent with human experience and just even our emotional Instinct how many grandmas and grandpas do we have here tonight just raise your hand know the house is just full of those that have experienced this so it is a for you to think that God would say say God do you have any grandchildren says no I have no grandchildren and you might think a and he'd say well no don't awe me I don't even want them and for human beings I could say this and I'm really speaking out of turn because I haven't personally only experienced this but the thought of having grandchildren I have maybe experienced this thought the the you don't have the thought of having grandchildren early in life I imagine if I was to ask Jack have you given any thought to your grandchildren he'd say no if I ask Preston the same Elliot the same and and you ask young people you know are your thoughts on grandchildren they like I think you're skipping some steps there brother Aaron there's a ways I would have to go before I could start looking forward to her thinking about grandchildren so the idea of being a grandparent or having grandchildren isn't something that comes up early in life nor is it even something that comes up in marriage but once children come there is a point in a parent life where they begin to look forward to grandchildren and I may try to come back to that particular thought uh later on on Sunday or later on on Sunday morning but we there's maybe a point where now having had children or grand children you start thinking about the idea of what of now being a Grand parent and not just a parent and in looking forward to having these little ones uh this is this is human nature this is this is the evolution of things and I believe scripturally that parents there should be some thought given to uh the future that you should have your future the future in mind as you raise children I maybe I could back up and say you should have the future in mind when you marry brother Braham said when a man chooses a wife it says something about the his future home so the future is in mind when we choose to court when we choose to marry and we ought to act with the future in mind we plant our potatoes as if there's going to be a harvest we we act and we do things now that we wouldn't regret later and so we're always in this mindset of of living out our lives as if there's going to be some sort of future and so scripturally parents as they raise their children should not only just have the future in mind but they should have their grandchildren in mind not just their children but even their children's children because proverbs 13:22 says a good man leaveth an inheritance to his children's children and the wealth of the sinner is laid up for the just in other words a sinner is just going to squander it anyways and it'll only go to the just and the upright and so it says a good man leaves an inheritance for his children's children anybody know a way that they could write that where it uses fewer words leaves an inheritance to his grandchildren your children's children are your grandchild so it say A Good Man is a grandfather who Lee has left an inheritance to his grandchildren in 1 Timothy 5:4 a very specific admonishments that are taking place here but just want to isolate this one it says but if any widow have children or nephews and it kind of does seem a little odd that it would talk about children also just single out the nephews we might begin to think about what about our nieces and what about cousins but this word here actually is also and could have been translated to grandchildren it's the same word that would have been used for grandchildren so if a widow has children or grandchildren let them learn first to show piety at home and to requite their parents for that is good and acceptable before God so the Bible is bringing a grandchild up no doubt when Brother David duplicity went through the scripture and started trying to find any instance of a gr grandpa or grandfather he might have find a reference to Timothy's grandmother Lois he might have found this reference to a children's children which would be grandchildren maybe even here in Timothy that a widow who has children or grandchildren let the let the grandchildren and the children show piety and Grace to her at home let not the Widow be a burden to the church but let the family take care of her and require requireed their parents in other words take care of them in their old age in their widowhood just as they had and pay them back for how they took care of you so this is God observing the natur or God knowing the natural Order of Things Paul having wisdom in the natural Order of Things saying that the Widow who has children or grandchildren let her be taken care of at home so the Bible isn't just ignoring the dynamic of grandchildren or the the responsibility of a parent to children and therefore by extension grandchildren or even the obligation of a grandchild to a grandparent it it acknowledges it scripturally but let me say this if God has no grandsons to be a grandparent and to have some sort of responsibility to a grandparent or as a grandchild have a responsibility to a grandparent this is purely a human responsibility it's purely a human phenomena it is something that I'm qu I'm just speaking out of turn and don't correct me right now in public but as far as I know there's there's not a lot of uh grandparent relationships within nature uh the you'll find certain uh areas where breeding habits may take place and there may be certain responsibilities within larger packs and flocks of animals H within a murder of crows I don't know there might be a grandparent within them but typically you find the uh multiple generation of mother to child and then that one goes off and it starts itself and there's all these relationships that are parent to child but then within human nature within our human uh classes and societies and ethnicities there's this responsibility in relationship of among family members and in particular a grandparent to a grandchild but God has no grandsons so that relationship is inherently human it is a human responsibility is a human phenomena that God himself doesn't have the same obligations there's nothing in the scripture to say that God is required to look after his grandchildren because God say I have none you could never prove it with DNA you can never prove it with the family tree God has no grandchildren right he is in fact not a grandpa and he doesn't want to be and the fact that he is not a grandpa and nor does he even want to be a grandpa may seem to be antihuman and I'm sure the grandparents are thinking yeah this kind of an odd put me in an odd spot here imagine brother John's thinking thanks son-in-law all my efforts to be virtuous as a grandpa to be Christlike and you're proving that as a grandpa I'm completely ungodlike that's not what I'm asserting God is not a grandpa and I'm I'm just going to be wrapping this up here in just the next few moments we don't have a lot more to share um I didn't anticipate just how long sometimes I'm when I'm ministering here you you all pull so much out of me that I could take just a page of notes and go three hours and you think I'm long-winded well I don't want to be a long-winded preacher but God is not a grandpa so then we have to ask ourselves why is it he's not a grandpa why is it that he has no grandsons or what is it that maybe we could get in put our thinking cap on and then look at what brother brandham had to say when he took this statement by Brother David duplicity and and took it to say say teach us something by it and so me I'm just kind of going to say this based upon what I believe brother bandam emphasized often when he used this this statement the chief lesson is there is no relationship to God unless you have been born of his Spirit no relationship to God you may be human you may be Earth you may be animal you may be all these different things but the you only relationship that they would You' have to God in that respect would be the created and he would be the Creator but there's no love relationship there's no bond there's no Affinity there's no relationship in terms of uh uh not to be created by a as something fabricated but to come from there's no relationship or chain back to God unless you have been born directly from God by his spirit so I may be ending up in the obvious place but if we could just read John chapter 3 veres 1 to9 I'd like to read this just to express to you the idea this Chief lesson of why God is not a grandpa says there was a man of the Pharisees named Nicodemus the ruler of the Jews the same came to Jesus by night and said unto him Rabbi we know that thou art a teacher come from God for no man could do these Miracles that thou doest except God be with him here is Humanity recognizing something Beyond Humanity that he must come from God there must be some a connection with God because he's doing things that only God could do and some ways we could say it's the same thing that these men of lonia had themselves recognized but them worshiping Jupiter and Mercury wanted to say that the gods have come are in the likeness of man and wanted to worship him but Nicodemus being a Believer he comes and he says we know that you must be from God if you're able to accomplish these things and the answer that Jesus has I think is kind of interesting considering the prompt acknowledging that you must come from God and God must be with you and it kind of a confession this affirmation of believe for Faith and then Jesus uh almost goes right past that to the real heart of the issue and he says verily verily I say unto thee except a man be born again he cannot see the kingdom of God Nicodemus had been making observations he had witnessed the supernatural he says no man can do the things that you do no man can do these Miracles unless God be with you so I believe you are a teacher that has come from God so having made these external observations Jesus says unless you're born again you cannot understand the kingdom of God you can observe speculate as to whether or not something has come from God you could even rightly conclude that this is Supernatural this is a miracle but you cannot understand what God is doing unless you're born again amen you can believe and you can experience and you can enjoy and you can have association with and even be touched by but you're never going to be able to relate to it and be a part of it and know what it is unless you are born again amen well this statement confounds Nicodemus who says how can a man be born born when he's old can he enter the second time into his mother's womb and be born and let me let me just say let me read verse n quickly and he answers to Jesus again how can these things be so Nicodemus being a man and understanding how births work I don't think he's being a smart alec I didn't I don't know Nicodemus maybe he was a a pretty funny guy but he says how can a man be born when he's old that Jesus again is saying something unless you be born birth from above and it it must have put Nicodemus in the mind of a babe coming forth the language that he uses would be unless you're ushered forth from above unless you are born again from heaven and you come forth uh a new and again you cannot understand the kingom of God he says well I've been born I've lived this life I'm an old man how is it that I can come through the birth canal again how is it I can come forth as a babe again Jesus say verily verely I thee he says except a man be born of water and of spirit he cannot enter into the Kingdom of Heaven that which is born of the flesh is flesh does that sound familiar subject to like passions no temptation but such as common to man these are God is not man God is not flesh this statement that which is born of the flesh is flesh man understands the things of man because he is man this scripture just summarizes what we read in James and in Hebrews and Corinthians and acts and and numbers and all these and even Isaiah this summarizes it flesh is flesh if you're born of a woman you think as a human your flesh is flesh but that which is born of the spirit is Spirit Marvel not that thou hearest the sound says Marvel not that I say unto thee ye must be born again don't Marvel that which is born of the flesh understands fleshly things but you must be born of the spirit to understand something super natural and spiritual you must be bornn again so now it is not just well unless you unless you're born again you can't understand the kingdom of God now we saying it's not just a matter of whether or not you understand it's a must the song says there is a must my friend you must be born again the wind bloweth where it listeth and thou hearest the sound thereof but th cannot tell when it cometh and whether it goeth so is everyone that is born of the spirit if we turn back on Nicodemus is first question I I know that you're a teacher come from God and you do these Miracles and you couldn't do them unless God was with you and well the wind blows and you hear the sound you've he you you've heard the wind blow you you've felt its Breeze but unless you're born of the spirit you really don't know what it is so Nicodemus walks away saying how he answers and said unto him how how can these things be you must be born again this is what is at the heart of these new even as the article expresses how that Pentecost had been come down to this condition where it's by tradition and it's by the experience of doing these different things and and that's what made you a part of it so you're just born into it and born into it and born into it now you just have generations of people that are piling up within churches who are Pentecostal by natural birth by natural right they're they're messaged Believers because their parents were messaged Believers and that's the way they were raised and so God is not a grandpa to say that you cannot be a Christian you cannot be a child of God unless you have been born again regardless of who or what your parents in their experience are or what they've had you need one yourself and thank God for some of us had parents who had no identity in Christ nor experience in Christ and it didn't condemn us to a life of not being experienced in Christ and in the same way that you're not bound by the the the lack of experience in your parents you're not liberated by your parents experience from sin and let me say this it's a great blessing to be a child of a child of God I testify that for me being born to parents that love God that serve God that were Christians my dad being a minister of the message my mom being a faithful wife to him and supporting him and being raised in a home first generation uh really first generation Christians and first generation message Believers it's a blessing to have been raised in that family and I say that there are many benefits to be a child of a child of God but there is no lawful inheritance and there would have been no lawful inheritance for me though my parents being in joint heirs with Christ by their own experience with God that the will and the reading of the word of God and the way that the law the testation would work and and the way everything was drawn up there I wasn't written into the will I couldn't be a joint Heir because they were right you cannot be a joint Heir with the Privileges of a son or daughter of God by natural birth and again I will say there are blessings that a child of a child of God can receive and I believe that there are many great Supernatural things that a child of God can claim for their children and there's power that is available to us as parents who are believers seal with the Holy Ghost but to our children or to those that might suppose that they can be somehow tangent related to the power of God because of natural birth God has no grandsons and God is not a grandpa but let me leave you with this as we will be closing on this thought I believe that there is is not a greater truth but a deeper truth because this new birth holds great significance to the nature of God why would Jesus say You must be born again and in the expressing of it Nicodemus I think is as I like to say he's picking up what Jesus is laying down he doesn't kind of make it kind of an analogy or he's not just making it you know oh I got to relate to this a different way immediately thinks how can I enter into my mother's womb and be born again cuz Jesus is conveying the thought of a rebirth a regeneration to come forth as a babe and God has set forth The Plan of Redemption from the beginning in such a way so that we could understand something about his nature even in the very beginning when God is unfolding creation and he arrives at the man and the man is now given a commandment to be fruitful multiply and replenish the earth and the woman comes forth from that man uh with the Testament and uh of to bring forth life and then the prohibition to not touch the tree of knowledge of Good and Evil that Satan must have known that the woman had something to do with bringing forth godlikeness and bringing forth the image of God so he attacked the woman and brother brandham says that when Satan worked forth uh set forth and did that which was necessary in the garden to fulfill the plan of God God all along has been allowing things to happen so that we can understand something about his nature because God wants to make himself known to us and in revealing himself to us he wants us to understand something about ourselves sometimes in life people begin to experience sicknesses and diseases or certain situations and they want to find out what's wrong and they find out maybe they were adopted or they had another parent uh that didn't raise them and they go to find them and hunt them down because maybe it may solve this medical mystery it might solve some sort of emotional problem they have by finding out who their parent is and so by God setting forth and telling us that there's to be a new birth and to be born from above it's telling us something about God this concept and idea of a birth has a rich Foundation from which that we we can get anchored in but then this purpose that it builds from we must understand the nature of God as a heavenly father not solely a human father but yet human relationships are a type just as there's a relationship of the bridegroom to the bride and it's understood between the love that a man would have for his wife and the the the respect that a wife would have for her husband and Paul admonishes the Believers in that regard he says husbands love your wives as Christ loves the church so the greater thought it's almost as if our marriages are an analogy and a type not the not the the truth we're the shadow of the real thing and so there can be something gained in understanding this Shadow there can be Lessons Learned in in seeing the symmetry of God's relationship to his bride or a man's relationship to his wife or God's relationship to his children but we must come to understand what it TR genuinely in its truth means in the Heavenly and that God has no grandchildren in 2 Corinthians 12:14 Paul says behold the third time I'm ready to come to you and I will not be burdensome to you he had told him I am your father in The Gospel he says for I seek not yours and what you have and your possessions and your money but you I'm concerned about you your heart your spiritual well-being he says for the children ought not to lay up for the parents but the parents for the children what an incredible statement so parents responsibility over their CH children as they're reared and as they are are taught he he says the par the children aren't laying up and saving and looking out after and providing and giving their money and giving their time and laying it up for the parents but the parents gladly spend and are spent for the children the parents are giving they have responsibility over the children and Paul is saying this as a spiritual father to the Corinthians drawing on their experience in the flesh and how that uh the parents strive and they give and they yield thems they take their yield and they use it for the benefit of their children he says that's how that it ought to be not the other way around and then jesus takes this in Luke chap 11 says after he's even taught the disciples how to pray which begins with Our Father which art in heaven and ask for forgiveness and daily bread and drawing in a spiritual sense and even relating in the natural way our dependency and our looking to God as a father and in verse 9 it says I say unto you ask and it shall be given you seek and you shall find knock and it shall be opened unto you for everyone that askthe findeth and to him that knocketh shall be opened and then for Jesus to drive this thought home he comes to a natural relationship if a son shall ask bread of any of you that is a father will he give him a stone or if he ask a fish will he for a fish give him a serpent or if he shall ask an egg will he offer him a scorpion kind of a a a really interesting pattern to say that well when you ask for bread does the dad give you a stone you ask her fish does he give you a snake you ask for egg does he give you a scorpion and and the answer to each one of those rhetorically should be no no and even in the dramatic sense that Christ is expressing and he's saying in general the right way an upright father one that loves his children would not give evil when one has asked for a necessary thing or made the right request and so there something to be gained even in the way that Jesus is uh wording this it doesn't say if a man ask his dad for a Lamborghini does he get a you know a cruise you know does he get a fort Pinto um what does he get and so he doesn't he's kind of shown in in there some sort of reason here and and this uh the way that he's phrasing it I think is for reason he says if ye then be an evil human subject to passions weak infirm complexes know how to give good gifts into your children how much more shall your heavenly father give the Holy Spirit to them that ask him and that's what I I want to end on is this thoughts thought if a a dad or a mom has a heart for their children and would do good things to their children and should have this vision for their child and should have a a desire to provide for them and to uh to give to them and to lay up for them and that a good man is not only looking out after his children in responsible way to enrich their lives but he does so in a manner which impacts and benefits his grandchildren's life if the Bible is instructing that Widow who has children and grandchildren to benefit from their piety and their very requie and in their love then it says something about how that we as natural people even without Christ look out after our children instinctively and give them good things and raise them in a way that we can even benefit later on as grandchildren or grandparents he says how much more how much more your heavenly father and all parental aspects and I say therein lies the secret as to why God is not a grandpa and God has no grandsons because how much more your heavenly father that means he has a very specific Vision he H has something that's very pre it's precise for his children and his involvement transcends anything that we would know in general about a relationship of a grandparent to a grandchild amen could you stand with me tonight as we pray God is not a grandpa I was telling my children recently I think it was Jack or one of them said that brother John my dear friend my father-in-law and friend he said said that he was the best grandpa in the world and I looked at him said your days are numbered CU one day when they have kids beleving that I'll assume the title is the greatest grandfather in the world but I could say that my children are blessed with the best grandpa that one could ask for because of the heart he has for the Lord the genuine nature that he has to see you succeed but even in that even in that this truth how much more your heavenly father to know to know that God is more personal more intimate more involved yes I give you a little bit of a sneak peek there's a lot of things that we say about grandchildren we say they are a reward for surviving your own children they're a reward for keeping your children alive but many of them Express the thought and the idea that there is a difference that we have the relationship between a grandchild and a grandparent and God doesn't know what that's like and it's for a reason just pray for us as we will continue Sunday morning Lord willing and go deeper into this truth let's bow our heads in prayer gracious Heavenly Father tonight Lord as we have been able to I believe thoroughly cover a very simple subject in just a short period of time through the benefit of your scripture Lord which just covers it so beautifully Lord myself having been instructed by the messenger of the hour and just pouring over the things that he had to say about it even being a student of what he taught on the new birth Lord Lord and God's desire for us to mature and to grow Lord I'm just filled with so much inspiration on this subject and Lord I've chosen and just felt impressed to use a title that kind of catches our attention that God has no grandchildren because Lord I I I I feel that it's so important today to emphasize two great truths that we must be born again that we're to be babies in Christ that we're to begin to desire the sincere milk of your word but then also Lord that we must grow we must grow we cannot remain children forever and Lord There's Something About That season of life when one begins to look forward to grandchildren and whether it be as a parent to with children starts to look forward to the time when they can assume a different role or even when the grandparent now anticipation with the oncoming baby looks forward to that moment and that time when grandchildren enter their life Lord It's it speaks of a season Lord where even as one writer put it that the responsibilities and the obligations are just enough removed so that real genuine friendship is possible but Lord your desire for us is not to remain in the cuddle stage in the toddler stage in that stage where many parents love holding their babies and don't ever want them to grow up that stage where grandparents enjoy those they can just really get a kick out of the terrible twos and the nonsensical language and the cute little things that are done without the frustrations of it happening on a daily basis or the lack of obedience Lord in that season where maybe some grandparents like oh I hope they never grow up you've never had that thought Lord you've never had that thought Lord you can appreciate when we're green and we dance and the spirit and the wind moves and we can move with your spirit and but yet Lord you desire that we grow up to be a fruitful tree and ourselves bring forth fruit is not your desire Lord that we grow old and lose our leaves and groan and Quake and uh and shutter when the wind is breezing through the young saplings Lord you don't want us to end up like that but Lord you don't want us to be green forever you want us to grow up and Lord I believe that is at the heart of why you have no grandsons and I thank God that you're no grandpa thank you Lord so I yield myself to you Lord as son thanes do with me as you see fit as my Godly parent my heavenly father we love you Lord we commit ourselves to to you now we just pray your blessing upon your people as they worship you Lord as our hearts remain fixed upon you in the name
