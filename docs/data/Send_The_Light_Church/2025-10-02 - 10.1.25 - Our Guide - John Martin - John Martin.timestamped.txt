[8:03] had no peace within. Till I heard how
[8:06] Jesus died upon the tree.
[8:10] Then I fell down at his feet. And there
[8:14] came a peace so sweet. Now the comforter
[8:18] abides with me.

[11:43] but a smile quickly drives it away.
[11:48] Hallelujah.

[11:57] tear can abide. Well, we trust and oy.

[14:54] him.
[14:56] &gt;&gt; And when you obey him,
[14:59] he blesses you.
[15:02] He's still working on me, though.
[15:06] How about you, Brother Dennis?
[15:07] &gt;&gt; Yes, he's working on me.
[15:09] &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah.
[15:12] He's still working on me
[15:17] to make me what I ought to be.
[15:21] It took him just a week to make the moon
[15:24] and the stars, the sun and the earth and
[15:28] Jupiter and Mars. A lovely patient he
[15:33] must be.
[15:35] He's still working on me. Thank you,
[15:38] Lord.
[15:40] He's still working on me. Aren't you
[15:43] glad to make me one ought to be?
[15:49] It took him just a week to make the moon
[15:52] and the stars, the sun and the earth and

[16:22] Hallelujah. I'm thankful. He's still
[16:23] working on me. Amen. Till we get out of
[16:26] this past house,
[16:28] he's still going to be working on it.
[16:30] Like Paul said, it's not that yet I've
[16:32] obtained, but I I still run after.
[16:36] Amen. Our sister Trish has a request.
[16:39] Please remember my aunt Gail in your
[16:42] prayer. She had some oral surgery and is
[16:45] in much pain. Also, she has an unspoken
[16:48] request. Any anybody else with an
[16:50] unspoken, just lift it before the Lord
[16:53] tonight.
[16:55] He definitely knows your your heart.
[16:58] Amen. And uh Sister Linda has a request.
[17:01] Linda Helms is going into ER this uh
[17:04] evening as her doctor uh instructed her
[17:08] she is going to have a cardio over
[17:11] vision. They are concerned about a AIB.
[17:15] I think what basically what she told me
[17:17] is they stop your heart and then restart
[17:20] it or something and you know uh it's out
[17:22] of sync basically and sometimes uh
[17:26] spiritually speaking we can get out of
[17:28] sync too, right? We got to figure out
[17:31] where we left God and go back there and
[17:33] start. Amen. So, let's just lift that
[17:37] up. Amen. Also, uh Elizabeth Murphy, uh
[17:40] lift her up. Uh there's needs in uh in
[17:44] leadership of the of the Lord for her
[17:47] medical needs. Amen.
[17:50] She just has the desire just to
[17:53] be willing whatever the Lord has says
[17:56] just follow that. So we just pray for
[17:58] her. Al also uh brother Rogers dad
[18:04] um he's uh has forest or stage four
[18:07] cancer and uh he needs Lord.
[18:12] So
[18:14] we look at the cancer and we wouldn't
[18:16] want anybody to have cancer because we
[18:19] all know somebody that's got it.
[18:22] But if you have a if you don't know Lord
[18:25] and you're not saved,
[18:27] cancer is nothing.
[18:32] Eternity is forever.
[18:35] So
[18:37] in death, the cancer will leave,
[18:40] but we pray for his soul and also that
[18:43] the Lord would just touch his heart.
[18:45] Amen.
[18:47] He's the only one that can do that.
[18:49] Amen. Let's just remember all those that
[18:51] aren't here tonight.
[18:54] We pray that
[18:58] as as we get closer to the top of the
[19:00] pyramid, it gets narrower.
[19:06] The long the road is narrow
[19:09] and it's only going to be those that
[19:10] seek it that are going to find it. So we
[19:13] pray Lord that he would just send
[19:15] workers in the in the harvest. Amen. for
[19:19] those that are trying to find a broad
[19:22] way to Jesus
[19:24] and there is no broad way.
[19:26] So we pray that he can just use everyone
[19:29] here. It doesn't matter how old you are,
[19:32] how young you are, he can use you if you
[19:35] got a willing heart.
[19:37] So let's just stand this afternoon
[19:40] and uh just remember brother John in
[19:43] prayer also that uh
[19:46] the Lord would just use him as he he's
[19:49] does many times to speak to us but uh
[19:52] that our hearts would be tender and they
[19:54] would just receive the word that would
[19:57] be a our hearts would just be prepared
[19:59] for the word tonight.
[20:02] Let's just go accord. Dear heavenly
[20:03] father, Lord, as we approach your
[20:05] throne, Lord, as we humble ourselves
[20:07] before the mighty hand of God, Lord,
[20:10] there's nothing that we can do of
[20:12] ourselves, Lord, but submit to you and
[20:15] know that you are all powerful,
[20:17] allseeing, all knowing God, Lord, for
[20:19] this Elizabeth Murphy with this
[20:22] sufferers, this cancer, Lord, she's just
[20:25] surrendered to you and she's just
[20:27] looking for leadership and to her
[20:30] medical needs. Lord, for brother Rogers
[20:32] dad, Lord, we just pray for a surrender
[20:34] in his life, Lord. That Lord, you would
[20:37] just that he would reach out and just
[20:40] have a desire in his heart to know you,
[20:42] Lord God. And Lord, and through that,
[20:44] Lord God, you might heal his body, mind,
[20:46] and soul, Lord God. We pray in the name
[20:49] of Jesus, Lord, for our sister Linda
[20:52] Helms, Lord, that went into the hospital

[33:26] would be able to leave here with
[33:27] something
[33:29] &gt;&gt; that we didn't have when we came. And
[33:31] that has to be only by the power of the
[33:34] Holy Spirit to do that, right? We in
[33:37] ourselves can't do it, but God can.
[33:40] Let's just look to him in prayer and
[33:42] then we'll get into the word of God.
[33:44] Father, we thank you, Lord, for those of
[33:49] your your people that have gathered out
[33:52] today to worship you, that to fight
[33:55] through uh Lord, the pain and the their
[33:58] bodies, the things of the day, Lord,
[34:02] just to come into your house and to get
[34:05] strengthened by your word. We pray that
[34:09] your presence would be made known
[34:12] through the unveiling and through the
[34:14] revealing of your word today. Lord, may
[34:18] each one of us be so in tune with your
[34:22] spirit today that we would be able to
[34:25] receive from you, Lord, and not from a
[34:28] man. We ask that Lord, you'd give us the
[34:30] grace to get out of the way, Lord, that
[34:32] you would use this vessel to minister.
[34:35] you'd help the people to get out of the
[34:37] way that they may be able to hear what
[34:39] the spirit is saying to the church
[34:41] today. Father, we love you and we thank
[34:44] you, Lord, that you've given us this
[34:46] privilege that the doors are still open,
[34:48] knowing one day they will be closed,
[34:51] Lord, just uh just experiencing and and
[34:56] and hearing about what's going on uh
[35:00] from Lord, just this this shooting and
[35:04] uh what's transpired in these these
[35:06] churches here of late. God, we know it's
[35:10] just the grace of you, Lord, that allows
[35:13] us to be able to come in here under the
[35:16] the safety, Lord, of the Holy Ghost and
[35:20] and have a a a time of worship and and
[35:23] praise and Lord, to receive of your word
[35:27] in in the most uh sacred way. God, we
[35:31] just thank you for this today.
[35:33] Thank you for all that you're doing,
[35:35] Lord, in our lives to to get us ready
[35:37] for the rapture. We praise you for all
[35:40] things now in Jesus Christ's name. Amen.
[35:44] Amen. Turn with me, if you would, to the
[35:46] book of Psalms uh 127
[35:49] for our opening scripture today. Psalms
[35:53] 127.
[36:00] The world is getting crazier and
[36:01] crazier.
[36:06] But at the same time that it's getting
[36:08] crazier,
[36:10] God's bride is getting more like Jesus.
[36:14] &gt;&gt; Amen. It's just a promise. We don't have
[36:17] to wait for everything to be perfect in
[36:19] order for us to get ready.
[36:21] &gt;&gt; Amen. Psalms 127 verse number one.
[36:27] Amen.
[36:28] Praise the Lord. All there.
[36:31] &gt;&gt; Amen. Except the Lord build the house,
[36:35] they labor in vain that build it. And
[36:38] except the Lord keep the city, the
[36:42] watchmen
[36:44] walketh but in vain. Amen. God bless
[36:48] you. May be seated. Except the Lord
[36:50] build the house, they labor in vain that
[36:53] build it. And except the Lord keep the
[36:56] city, the watchman
[36:58] uh uh I'm sorry, waketh but in vain.
[37:03] So we need God.
[37:07] We need God. Except the Lord keep the
[37:10] city. The watchman
[37:13] waketh but in vain. In other words, we
[37:15] need God with us. God is the one that
[37:18] must watch over us and watch over our
[37:20] church.
[37:22] He must be the one here to take care of
[37:25] us, to protect us.
[37:28] If you want a a good health, you most
[37:32] likely have to uh have a good doctor to
[37:36] guide you.
[37:39] I would say that to be the truth. You
[37:42] wouldn't want a bad doctor. Brother
[37:43] Brandham says you want to you would want
[37:45] the best doctor if he's going to have do
[37:48] surgery on you. You want to have the
[37:50] best. You wouldn't want someone who
[37:52] hasn't been there. I was listening to a
[37:55] recording while on hold today trying to
[37:58] set up my uh MRI for my shoulder. And as
[38:02] I was listening, this recording came
[38:04] out, automatic recording, and it was
[38:06] talking about lung cancer being uh still
[38:10] the leading cause of cancer death in in
[38:14] uh globally and in the US. It's it's
[38:18] even higher than when you combine
[38:20] prostate, breast, and colon cancer
[38:24] together. Lung cancer is still leading
[38:27] them all. And that was I was really
[38:29] surprised with it because you don't hear
[38:32] much about it. Um, but my dad, he had
[38:36] died of of lung cancer and it's still uh
[38:39] it's still a leading cause. And I would
[38:41] think that if we if we had cancer, we
[38:44] would we would want the very best
[38:47] possible doctor to help guide us through
[38:49] this situation in our life.
[38:52] I like to entitle this message our
[38:54] guide. Except the Lord build the house,
[38:57] they labor in vain that build it. God is
[39:01] the master builder.
[39:05] We have to be perfectly in sync with
[39:07] him. We cannot be calling the shots,
[39:12] &gt;&gt; doing things the way we want to, working
[39:14] when and if we feel like it, or else our
[39:18] labor and our efforts are going to be in
[39:20] vain. God has to be be the one that's
[39:24] building the house. And if I could say
[39:26] it like this, we are God's house.
[39:29] &gt;&gt; We are the temple of the living God. And
[39:32] we need him to to build our house. Now,
[39:35] it's not our natural bodies that's the
[39:38] house of God.
[39:41] &gt;&gt; It we can't even say it, you know, well,
[39:44] we're a human being and and and and we
[39:46] are the temple of the living God. God
[39:48] does not dwell in an unholy temple. He
[39:52] won't do it. Uh uh so it's it's not just
[39:55] him dwelling in anybody. He has to get
[39:58] us to a place where he can come and
[40:00] dwell on us. And it's the the story that
[40:03] we've heard so often about like a cup
[40:07] that's in the the mud and and God comes
[40:11] and he takes that cup out of the mud as
[40:15] if it was never in the mud. And that's
[40:16] justification.
[40:18] And then he takes that cup and he washes
[40:21] it out and cleanses it out and and and
[40:24] gets it ready. And we are washed by the
[40:26] washing or or the water of the word. And
[40:30] he cleanses our life with the word and
[40:32] and we get ready for service, right? But
[40:36] we're still not where we need to be
[40:40] until he comes and he dwells inside of
[40:43] us.
[40:45] &gt;&gt; That that that's the the the baptism of
[40:48] the Holy Ghost and and then we become a
[40:52] temple of the living God. Praise the
[40:55] Lord.
[40:57] &gt;&gt; In fact, um let's just read a little bit
[41:00] about that. That's 2 Corinthians 6:14.
[41:02] If you want to write it down, the Bible
[41:04] says, "Be not unequally yolked together
[41:09] with unbelievers?
[41:11] For what fellowship have righteousness
[41:13] with unrighteousness? And what communion
[41:16] have light with darkness? And what
[41:18] concord have Christ with bile? Or what
[41:22] part have he that believeth with an
[41:23] infidel? Or what agreement have the
[41:26] temple of God with idols?
[41:28] You can see that there's a contrast.
[41:30] God's saying there's a contrast. Not
[41:32] everybody who says they believe are
[41:34] believers.
[41:37] For you are the temple of the living
[41:39] God. As God has said, I will dwell in
[41:41] them and walk in them and I will be
[41:43] their God and they shall be my people.
[41:45] You are the temple of the living God, he
[41:48] says. So what do we ought to do first?
[41:51] Wherefore come out from among them, and
[41:55] be ye separate, saith the Lord, and
[41:57] touch not the unclean thing, and I will
[42:01] receive you.
[42:02] &gt;&gt; So there's a step that we have to take
[42:04] first. And I will be a father unto you,
[42:07] and you shall be my sons and daughters,
[42:09] sayaeth the Lord Almighty. So many so
[42:12] many people want to be the temple of
[42:14] God, but they don't want to come out of
[42:15] the world.
[42:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[42:18] And that's not how it goes. You can't
[42:20] just say I'm saved. I'm a temple of God.
[42:23] God dwells in human body. It's not like
[42:25] that.
[42:26] It's it's there's a part that we have to
[42:28] play in order for the Holy Ghost to come
[42:30] in. And this is why I think there's so
[42:32] many people's lives get messed up and
[42:34] get so confused is because they try to
[42:36] take on Christianity without the gospel,
[42:39] without going the way the word tells us
[42:41] to go. So the first step we must take is
[42:44] to become the temple of the living God
[42:46] is we must separate ourselves from being
[42:49] yolked together with unbelievers from
[42:51] fellowshipping with unrighteousness
[42:53] having communion with darkness and we
[42:55] must take a stand and separate ourselves
[42:58] from all the worldly influences. If they
[43:01] if we're if we're listening if we're
[43:03] we're paying attention to the
[43:04] worldliness it's going to creep in our
[43:06] life and it's going to choke out the
[43:08] word. Amen. Wherefore come out from
[43:10] among them, and be ye separate, sayeth
[43:13] the Lord, and touch not the unclean
[43:15] thing, and I will receive you. The Bible
[43:19] says, and once we made that decision to
[43:22] separate, now God can receive us, and he
[43:25] can begin to build his house in us,
[43:29] the way he wants things to be done.
[43:32] Because his thoughts are higher than our
[43:35] thoughts. His ways are higher than our
[43:37] ways. His way of doing things is
[43:39] different than our way of doing things.
[43:40] He is the master builder. And unless God
[43:43] builds the house, they that labor labor
[43:46] in vain. God does things different than
[43:49] we do things. For example, if I was
[43:52] going to impart onto my one of my
[43:55] children um some good uh virtues and
[43:59] some good uh character in life, I would
[44:02] sit down with them and and I would give
[44:04] them some good counsel and I would tell
[44:06] them now you just stay away from these
[44:08] things and and you do this and and and
[44:11] you will get uh what you need uh to be
[44:14] in the character of Jesus Christ. But
[44:17] that ain't the way that God does things.
[44:19] The way that God does things is he sends
[44:22] fiery trials into your life
[44:25] because character is molded into trial.
[44:27] And that's why he's the master builder.
[44:30] He's the one that we got to follow. We
[44:32] can't just do things our way and try to
[44:34] become a good Christian our way. We've
[44:36] got to come in God's way.
[44:40] &gt;&gt; Oh, I love the word.
[44:42] Love the word. God's ways are different
[44:45] than our ways. Beloved, think not
[44:49] strange the fiery trials which is to try
[44:52] you as though some strange things happen
[44:54] unto you. My brethren, count it all joy
[44:57] when you fall into diverse temptation,
[44:59] knowing this that the trying of your
[45:02] faith, it works patience.
[45:05] And let patience have its perfect work
[45:06] that you may be perfect and entire
[45:08] wanting nothing. You know, my way of
[45:11] getting patience would be different.
[45:12] God, please give me patience. I want
[45:14] patience.
[45:18] See, God's got to be the one building
[45:20] the character. It can't be our way of of
[45:23] of doing things. We need God to be our
[45:26] guide in building our house. Except the
[45:30] Lord build you the house, they labor in
[45:34] vain that build it. Except the Lord
[45:37] build our character a a place for him to
[45:40] dwell in. Are it's going to be in vain.
[45:42] Only God can build character.
[45:48] And what he does is he teaches us to
[45:50] overcome things because brother Brandham
[45:51] said character is not a gift, it's a
[45:53] victory. So we have to face a trial and
[45:56] and and stare at that trial and say I
[45:58] will not be overcome of this trial. I
[46:01] will overcome this trial with a trust in
[46:03] God with a a a a purpose that God is
[46:07] going to work this out for my good. And
[46:08] I'm going to trust him through I'm going
[46:10] to give him glory through the trial. I'm
[46:12] going to praise him at the beginning.
[46:13] I'm going to praise him in the middle.
[46:15] I'm going to trust him that he's going
[46:16] to take me out of this fiery furnace,
[46:18] that he's going to meet me there.
[46:21] And that's what an overcomer does. An
[46:24] overcomer doesn't just say, "God can do
[46:27] it." And you murmur and complain through
[46:29] the whole thing and then when things
[46:32] work out at the end, we say, "Yeah, I
[46:33] know God was in it all the way." No, we
[46:36] give him praise all the way through.
[46:39] Remember Jesus saying, "I go to prepare
[46:42] a place for you and where I am there you
[46:44] may be also."
[46:46] &gt;&gt; In other words, without
[46:49] us changing, we will not be ready for
[46:53] heaven.
[46:57] I go to prepare a place for you that
[46:59] where you're at, you're going to be able
[47:01] to come and be with me. In other words,
[47:04] God is not changing to come with us. We
[47:06] have to change to come to be with God.
[47:09] &gt;&gt; So let's pick that up in John 14:2 says,
[47:11] "In my father's house, are many
[47:14] mansions.
[47:17] If it were not so, I would have told
[47:19] you. I go to prepare a place for you.
[47:24] And if I go to prepare a place for you,
[47:26] I will come again and I'll bow to
[47:28] receive you unto myself that where I am,
[47:31] you can be in the same place."
[47:34] and and whether I go, you know, and you
[47:36] know the way. And Thomas said, 'Lord, we
[47:40] know not
[47:42] whether you're going and we don't even
[47:43] know the way. And Jesus said, I am the
[47:46] way. I'm the truth. I'm the life and no
[47:49] man can come unto the father but by me.
[47:52] Jesus is saying that he is the guide to
[47:55] eternal life.
[47:57] He is the guide to building the home. He
[48:00] is the place. He is the one that we need
[48:02] so personally in our life that our our
[48:05] lives begin to display what the Bible
[48:08] really says.
[48:11] Jesus said in St. John 16 verse 13, "How
[48:14] be it when he, the Spirit of truth is
[48:17] come, he will guide you into all truth.
[48:22] For he shall not speak of himself, but
[48:25] whatsoever he hears, that shall he
[48:28] speak, and he shall show you things to
[48:30] come." Now that word guide it means to
[48:32] show the way.
[48:36] It means to teach. It means to lead.
[48:40] This is why we need the Holy Ghost.
[48:44] Because our way of thinking,
[48:47] you know, somebody can talk you into
[48:49] something, somebody can talk you out of
[48:50] it.
[48:53] But if God talks you into something,
[48:59] nobody's going to talk you out of it.
[49:01] I've I've experienced a number of times
[49:04] talking with people that they were
[49:06] convinced
[49:08] that they were going to stay with the
[49:10] word, stay with the truth.
[49:13] That's what they they told me. But what
[49:16] happened? They started talking to
[49:18] another person. They started getting
[49:21] under the influence of another person
[49:24] and all of a sudden they changed their
[49:26] mind. Well, at that time it was pretty
[49:29] obvious to me that God never revealed it
[49:31] to them.
[49:33] It it it it came it was just under the
[49:38] influence of a human being because when
[49:40] God reveals the truth to you, you stay
[49:42] with it.
[49:44] And that's why we need the Holy Ghost to
[49:47] guide us. It's not good enough for
[49:49] brother John to guide us.
[49:53] It it it's it's
[49:56] not even good enough to say um
[50:00] well, you know, this is the way I I had
[50:03] somebody tell me today, you know, we
[50:05] just made a a decision that we're just,
[50:08] you know, we're we're we're going to
[50:10] raise our family um wi with our our
[50:13] family's church.
[50:16] Like you know, brother Bam says, don't
[50:17] choose your church like you chose your
[50:19] wife, right? In other words, don't make
[50:22] it such a light choosing. It's an
[50:24] important decision.
[50:26] And you know, marrying who you're going
[50:28] to marry is the most important decision,
[50:31] right? But people have made so light of
[50:33] that
[50:35] God said, "This is the word of God. This
[50:36] is your eternal destiny." And you need
[50:39] to be careful about making a decision of
[50:41] where you're going to go to church
[50:43] because they can either preach to you a
[50:46] compromised gospel that will never make
[50:48] a rapture no matter how enjoyable it is
[50:51] to be in church.
[50:53] &gt;&gt; Or you can go to a church where you're
[50:55] going to hear the truth and have an
[50:57] opportunity to make a rapture.
[51:00] &gt;&gt; Because just going to the church doesn't
[51:02] get you in a rapture.
[51:04] &gt;&gt; You've got to you've got to adhere to
[51:06] the word of God. Amen.
[51:09] &gt;&gt; Jesus says is expedient that I go away.
[51:12] If I go not away, the comforter will not
[51:14] come to guide us. To guide us where? To
[51:18] guide us into a new nature.
[51:23] To guide us into the image of Jesus
[51:25] Christ. To guide us into the statue of a
[51:29] perfect man.
[51:31] The Bible says that we've been
[51:32] predestinated to be conformed to the
[51:34] image of God. Now, how do we get there?
[51:37] We need a guide. We need something to to
[51:40] show us the way.
[51:43] God has built a a mansion for us. And
[51:45] like I said, I want to entitle this our
[51:47] guide. I want to entitle this message
[51:49] our guide. And a guide is someone who is
[51:52] a person that who advises or shows the
[51:56] way to others. It's a real simple
[51:59] definition. And we've heard of of uh
[52:02] guides. They're hunting guides. They
[52:04] take you. How many's ever been uh guided
[52:07] in a hunting guide before?
[52:10] Okay. How about a fishing guide? Has
[52:13] anybody been under a fishing guide? Oh,
[52:15] right. A trapper guide. I mean, uh I've
[52:20] had a guy come out and uh this guy was
[52:23] so good. He knows how to get beavers on.
[52:25] We got problems with the beavers on our
[52:27] property. And I've tried different
[52:29] things, right? Boy, I've tried all
[52:31] different things getting beavers. But
[52:32] when you get somebody who knows how to
[52:35] get beavers, he can get he got results.
[52:37] I mean, he one he brought in like a
[52:39] whole family. There had to be like I
[52:41] don't know there was like six or seven.
[52:42] I wish Ann was here and one of them was
[52:44] the biggest one he ever caught. He
[52:46] wanted it as a trophy.
[52:48] But he was a guide and he he's a trapper
[52:51] and he knows how to do it. I I couldn't
[52:53] do it without him.
[52:56] How be it when the spirit of truth has
[52:58] come, he will guide you into all truth.
[53:01] He will show you the way. He will lead
[53:03] you. Not us and oursel and our ability.
[53:05] We're going to decide this way or that
[53:07] way. No. Except the Lord build the
[53:10] house. They that labor labored in vain.
[53:12] We need God to guide us into the statue
[53:15] of a perfect man. Amen. Into the image
[53:18] of Jesus Christ into a spiritual
[53:21] promised land. We need God to guide us
[53:23] into that.
[53:26] Be honest. We've never been to a
[53:28] promised land.
[53:30] We've never been to the spiritual
[53:31] promise. I have never been to the image
[53:33] of Jesus Christ. I've never been to the
[53:36] statue of a perfect man. I've never been
[53:39] there. I need a guide to get there. And
[53:43] I don't want the blind leading the
[53:44] blind. They both fall in the ditch,
[53:47] &gt;&gt; right? I need somebody who knows. And
[53:50] who is that? God. God himself. So, what
[53:54] does that do for us? knowing that God
[53:56] himself is to guide us. We need to get
[53:58] more serious about calling on God for
[54:01] God to fill us with himself to lead us
[54:05] &gt;&gt; because it's on the inside. The Bible
[54:06] says you have no need that any man teach
[54:08] you. But the Holy Ghost inside of you
[54:10] teaches you all things. And we need that
[54:13] for our lives. If there's one thing that
[54:15] we should do more than anything is spend
[54:18] time seeking the Holy Ghost because in
[54:22] doing that we will be fulfilling. lay
[54:24] aside everything until you get perfect
[54:26] love. Because perfect love is the Holy
[54:28] Ghost. It is the It is the Holy Ghost.
[54:31] That's what God is. God is love. And if
[54:34] we don't spend time seeking that and
[54:36] we're just depending on, well, I'll make
[54:38] it the church. I'll listen to the
[54:39] preaching of the word and somehow I'll
[54:41] change. That is not how it happens. You
[54:44] hear the word of God and you say, God, I
[54:46] want that for my life. And that's how it
[54:49] comes.
[54:53] Jesus said, "Enter ye in at the straight
[54:56] gate,
[54:58] because straight is the gate, narrow is
[54:59] the way that leth unto life, and few be
[55:01] that find it." If few people truly find
[55:05] the way to eternal life, then they need
[55:09] a guide to guide them there. It's not
[55:11] good enough. You know, many people are
[55:13] not going to make it that were in the
[55:15] message.
[55:17] How many people were in the message and
[55:19] got influenced
[55:22] by quotes that they did not understand
[55:26] and left the message,
[55:29] end up calling the prophet false,
[55:33] never had a revelation of who he was.
[55:38] I mean, think about they didn't the 70
[55:41] disciples that walked with Jesus, they
[55:44] didn't understand either.
[55:46] Even Peter said about Paul, there
[55:49] certain things about Paul that are hard
[55:51] to understand.
[55:54] But you don't throw the baby out with
[55:55] the bathwater. You you Brother Brand
[55:58] told us you learn to set things on the
[56:00] shelf, right? You don't understand
[56:02] something. He said, "Set it on the
[56:04] shelf." You you you're eating chicken.
[56:06] You run into the bone. You don't just
[56:07] throw the whole meal away.
[56:10] &gt;&gt; And and and you're you're eating a pie
[56:11] and it's a cherry pie and you come into
[56:13] a pit. You don't say this pie is
[56:15] terrible. You you take the pit out and
[56:16] you keep eating.
[56:18] &gt;&gt; And it's the same thing when we don't
[56:20] hear something we don't just totally
[56:21] agree with. We don't quite understand
[56:24] it. Set it on the shelf
[56:27] &gt;&gt; because God will reveal it to you.
[56:32] &gt;&gt; We need a guide to help us. And the
[56:35] Bible says that for so an entrance shall
[56:38] be ministered unto you abundantly into
[56:41] the everlasting kingdom of our Lord and
[56:43] our Savior Jesus Christ. An entrance to
[56:46] entering in is going to be ministered to
[56:49] us. And it's ministered to us through a
[56:52] fivefold ministry. Can you say amen? And
[56:55] he gave some apostles, prophets,
[56:58] evangelists, pastors, and teachers for
[57:00] the perfecting of the saints, for the
[57:02] work of the ministry, for the edifying
[57:04] of the body of Christ, till we all come
[57:06] into unity
[57:09] and the knowledge of the son of God,
[57:11] unto a perfect man, unto the measure and
[57:16] the statue of the fullness of Christ. I
[57:18] know we don't got that, but if you want
[57:19] to write it down, it's Ephesians chapter
[57:21] 4. Why do we need this? that we
[57:24] henceforth be no more children, tossed
[57:28] to and fro, and carried about with every
[57:31] wind of doctrine by the slight of men,
[57:34] the cunning craftiness whereby they lie
[57:37] and wait to deceive. You see, we're in
[57:39] an area that there's so many churches. I
[57:42] remember when I first gave my heart to
[57:46] God, I had enough uh I was raised
[57:49] Catholic and I went to church and uh I
[57:54] certainly didn't understand all the
[58:00] uh the weird stuff that happens in the
[58:02] church there. It just didn't make sense
[58:06] to me. And of course, I was a a child
[58:09] and I thought, well, maybe maybe it's
[58:12] because I'm a child and I don't
[58:14] understand.
[58:15] But as I grew up enough that I could sit
[58:18] down and have a meeting with the priest
[58:20] and begin to ask him questions, things
[58:23] that they did that were contrary to the
[58:25] word.
[58:27] Then I learned that his church was above
[58:32] the word of God and they had power to
[58:35] change the word of God.
[58:38] And I thought, God don't need any help
[58:41] with his word.
[58:44] &gt;&gt; He's the same yesterday, today, and
[58:45] forever. And he doesn't change. So
[58:48] therefore, the church was changing. The
[58:50] the pope had the power to change. I'm
[58:52] not saying anything that is not
[58:55] everybody knows.
[58:57] So I remember
[58:59] leaving that in my heart, that church,
[59:01] coming out, being separated from that
[59:06] And I remember, God, I just need you to
[59:09] guide me what church to go to. I don't
[59:12] know which one to go to. There were so
[59:13] many of them.
[59:16] &gt;&gt; And that's when God showed me that
[59:19] he's he's in his word and not just a
[59:24] man-made church.
[59:28] And God led by the grace of God to the
[59:30] message of the hour.
[59:33] But I think it was because what we know
[59:36] is because there's inside of all of us
[59:37] there's a predestination, right? There's
[59:39] that seed and somehow we all got
[59:42] testimonies of how we come. But I'm
[59:44] saying if there would not been a hunger
[59:46] for me, God guide me. God show me.
[59:49] &gt;&gt; People sit in message churches for years
[59:51] and they're never changed
[59:53] &gt;&gt; because they're not seeking out for the
[59:55] guide to to guide them in their heart.
[59:58] And they sit in church, they hear the
[1:00:00] word of God, and they don't want to
[1:00:01] change.
[1:00:03] they find a reason to not even
[1:00:08] they they have find a reason not to come
[1:00:09] to church
[1:00:11] and and you know I'm not discouraged in
[1:00:13] this aspect because the Bible told me
[1:00:15] years ago that there would be a falling
[1:00:17] away
[1:00:20] and
[1:00:22] it's it's really a perfecting time. It's
[1:00:25] a time where the bride is being
[1:00:27] perfected just like those that are of
[1:00:30] the seed of the world. They're they're
[1:00:32] manifesting too. They're the whole
[1:00:34] world's becoming more and more evil. in
[1:00:37] in our men's meeting, we're talking
[1:00:38] about there's such a a a compromise
[1:00:41] happening and and and and and people um
[1:00:46] they they don't really they're looking
[1:00:50] for a reason not to go all the way with
[1:00:53] God, just to be lukewarm and and to to
[1:00:56] enjoy entertainment and and they want
[1:01:00] other things of God.
[1:01:03] But now the Bibles, I just want to
[1:01:05] finish this up. But God has given us a
[1:01:08] five-fold ministry.
[1:01:10] Um, so that we're not tossed to and fro,
[1:01:14] that we're more established, that we
[1:01:17] don't have to keep learning the same
[1:01:18] thing over and over, that we we we know
[1:01:21] what the word says and we just make a
[1:01:23] decision in our heart, we're going to
[1:01:24] start doing it, and we're going to be
[1:01:25] faithful to it. Amen. but speaking the
[1:01:29] truth in love may grow up into him in
[1:01:32] all things which is the head even Christ
[1:01:36] and a lot of people they don't want to
[1:01:37] grow up in all things
[1:01:40] just want to just you know grow up a
[1:01:42] little bit but not too much because you
[1:01:44] know what growing up you know what that
[1:01:45] means responsibility
[1:01:48] responsibility
[1:01:49] from whom the whole body fitly joined
[1:01:52] together compacted by every by which
[1:01:55] every joint supplieth according to the
[1:01:57] effectual working in the measure of
[1:01:59] every part, making increase of the body
[1:02:01] unto the edifying of itself in love.
[1:02:04] Now, I love that. That's a deep verse.
[1:02:07] So, inside my my shoulder, I had damage
[1:02:10] done to one of my muscles. And
[1:02:12] literally, I cannot lift my left arm.
[1:02:16] That's it. And it kills when I do that.
[1:02:18] But I can do it here. And so what this
[1:02:20] is, and I'm not sure, I'm just I'm gonna
[1:02:21] get the MRI, but there's a a muscle
[1:02:24] there that is just not allowing it to
[1:02:27] happen. So I don't know if it's severed.
[1:02:28] I don't know what happened there, but
[1:02:31] what they're doing is that um everything
[1:02:35] around that muscle, they're building all
[1:02:37] the other muscles around it, and they're
[1:02:40] building that joint. And I'm doing all
[1:02:42] kinds of exercises that don't have to do
[1:02:44] with just reaching out and turn the
[1:02:46] faucet on because I can't even do that.
[1:02:49] And so it's trying to build that area so
[1:02:53] it can supply what is needed to help.
[1:02:56] And that's what we should be doing as a
[1:02:58] body of Christ.
[1:03:00] That we should literally be helping one
[1:03:03] another.
[1:03:05] We we shouldn't be just, you know, the
[1:03:08] the church is for me. No, the the church
[1:03:10] is to help somebody. That's how we grow.
[1:03:14] And if you look at it, a lot of times
[1:03:17] people who view the church is the church
[1:03:19] is there to help me and my problem. They
[1:03:22] are the people that never grow. They are
[1:03:24] the people that end up walking away.
[1:03:27] Because here's the thing, it is more
[1:03:29] blessed to give than to receive. And
[1:03:31] when you give, God just has a way of
[1:03:33] giving back to you.
[1:03:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:03:35] &gt;&gt; You don't wait for somebody to give to
[1:03:37] you. God gives to you. and he gives in
[1:03:41] great ways.
[1:03:43] Now, we've never been perfected before
[1:03:45] and we need a guide and that guide is
[1:03:48] the Holy Ghost. How many can say you've
[1:03:50] never been perfected before? Okay, so
[1:03:53] except the Lord build the house, right?
[1:03:56] We need him to build the perfection in
[1:03:59] us. So, again, it's all about God being
[1:04:03] our guide, the Holy Ghost being our
[1:04:05] guide. Now, we can identify this on a
[1:04:09] question and answers. We're going to
[1:04:11] take a test. Okay. Who's our guide? God.
[1:04:13] Who's our guide? The Holy Ghost. Who's
[1:04:15] our guide? The word of God. We can all
[1:04:17] answer that.
[1:04:19] But can we say, "I woke up and God
[1:04:21] guided me. I had this question. I had
[1:04:25] this situation and God told me what to
[1:04:27] do and I did it."
[1:04:30] &gt;&gt; Because that's what needs to happen. And
[1:04:32] that the only way that's going to happen
[1:04:34] is when we say, "God, I need you to
[1:04:37] guide me. I need you to show me what to
[1:04:39] do and not to depend on anything else
[1:04:43] except God. Except the Lord build the
[1:04:46] house." They labor in vain that build
[1:04:49] it. That's why we I I say to the wives
[1:04:52] in the church, we cannot depend on our
[1:04:55] husband to build the house.
[1:04:59] That's a God's truth. We are depending
[1:05:03] on God in our husbands to build the
[1:05:07] house.
[1:05:09] We don't we don't put the responsibility
[1:05:12] on our husbands to do what only God can
[1:05:15] do.
[1:05:17] God has to be the one building our home,
[1:05:20] building our relationships, building our
[1:05:22] families, building our character. It is
[1:05:25] God that works in us both to will and to
[1:05:28] do of his good pleasure. Amen.
[1:05:31] Psalms 31:2 says, "Bow down thine ear to
[1:05:35] me and deliver me speedily."
[1:05:38] We all should be able to relate to this.
[1:05:42] Um, "Be thou my strong rock for a house
[1:05:46] of defense to save me."
[1:05:51] We all need that. For thou art my rock,
[1:05:55] my fortress.
[1:05:56] Therefore, thy for thy name's sake lead
[1:06:00] me and guide me.
[1:06:03] Pull me out of the net that they have
[1:06:06] laid privately for me, for thou art my
[1:06:09] strength. We've all been in situations
[1:06:12] where we need help pulled out of it. We
[1:06:15] need a rock to stand on. We need a a
[1:06:17] fortress to to to to hide behind. We
[1:06:20] need someone to deliver us speedily. And
[1:06:22] who is that? God.
[1:06:24] God's the one that can do that. And we
[1:06:27] need to depend on God, not our own
[1:06:29] intellect. How are we going to fight
[1:06:31] this thing? How are we going to do this
[1:06:32] thing? How are we going to figure this
[1:06:34] out?
[1:06:35] No, we're leaning upon the arm of flesh
[1:06:37] when we do that. We need God.
[1:06:42] Amen. Acts 7:47. Acts chapter 7 verse
[1:06:46] 47. I believe this is Stephen here and
[1:06:48] he's he's speaking here. He says, "But
[1:06:51] Solomon built him a house."
[1:06:55] Built him a house. Built God a house.
[1:06:59] Remember, God told David, "You shed too
[1:07:02] much blood." Even though he had the
[1:07:04] desire to build a house for God, he
[1:07:07] couldn't do it. Said Solomon's going to
[1:07:09] do it. And Solomon built him a house.
[1:07:11] How be it, the Most High dwelleth not in
[1:07:15] temples made with hands, sayeth the
[1:07:19] prophet.
[1:07:21] Heaven is my throne and earth, this
[1:07:24] globe that we are in is God's foottool.
[1:07:29] What house will you build me? Sayeth the
[1:07:32] Lord.
[1:07:34] Or what is the place of my rest?
[1:07:38] Have not my hands made all these things?
[1:07:45] So God is not looking at our abilities.
[1:07:50] He's not looking at what we can do.
[1:07:54] Except the Lord build the house. They
[1:07:57] labor in vain that build it. But if we
[1:08:00] let God build the house and we just do
[1:08:03] what he tells us to do, our labor will
[1:08:05] not be in vain.
[1:08:08] It will accomplish a rapture for the
[1:08:10] bride. For let us be glad and rejoice
[1:08:16] for his wife have made herself ready.
[1:08:20] She's taken the word that God's given
[1:08:22] her and she's dressed herself with it
[1:08:25] and she's made ready for the marriage
[1:08:27] supper.
[1:08:29] Hallelujah.
[1:08:31] Except the Lord build our character for
[1:08:34] him to dwell in,
[1:08:37] all of our labor of trying to be a good
[1:08:39] Christian is going to be in vain.
[1:08:43] There were 10 virgins. Five were
[1:08:46] foolish. Five were wise.
[1:08:50] The five that were wise, they took oil.
[1:08:53] They got the guide.
[1:08:55] The other didn't. They said, "We can
[1:08:58] make it without the Holy Ghost. We don't
[1:09:00] have to get serious about seeking the
[1:09:02] Holy Ghost. I'll tell you, as soon as we
[1:09:05] reach that age of accountability, we
[1:09:07] need to be seeking the Holy Ghost. Too
[1:09:10] often, we just come into church and we
[1:09:12] play church and we just go through the
[1:09:14] motions of church and and and we don't
[1:09:17] get serious enough with God.
[1:09:20] I don't understand why we just don't get
[1:09:22] real serious with God because if we do,
[1:09:26] we'll end up getting other people to
[1:09:28] Christ.
[1:09:31] Verse 51 of of Acts chapter 7 verse 51
[1:09:34] says, "You stiff necked and
[1:09:37] uncircumcised in your heart and in your
[1:09:41] ears, you do always resist what?"
[1:09:46] Not the preacher.
[1:09:49] You resist the Holy Ghost
[1:09:52] as your fathers did. So do you.
[1:09:56] The Holy Ghost, the living word of God
[1:09:59] is our guide to our nature change.
[1:10:04] And if we keep resisting
[1:10:08] the Holy Ghost,
[1:10:10] then we're never going to get the nature
[1:10:12] change.
[1:10:14] &gt;&gt; We may get a form of godliness, but
[1:10:16] we'll deny the power thereof.
[1:10:19] So, we need to have this hunger for the
[1:10:22] guide to live inside of us and not just
[1:10:25] to tell us in our ear what to do, but to
[1:10:28] live inside of us to get up and say,
[1:10:30] "I've got the guide. He's He's living in
[1:10:33] me. He's He's leading and guiding me
[1:10:36] into all truth." Because that's what he
[1:10:39] promised to do when he comes into our
[1:10:41] heart. Matthew chapter 7 verse 24.
[1:10:45] Therefore,
[1:10:47] Jesus speaking, whosoever heareth these
[1:10:51] sayings of mine, and doeth them,
[1:10:56] I will liken him unto a wise man, which
[1:11:01] built his house
[1:11:04] upon a rock,
[1:11:06] and the rains just said, the floods
[1:11:08] came, the winds blew, and beat upon the
[1:11:09] house, and it fell not, for it was
[1:11:11] founded upon a rock. If I could just say
[1:11:13] it like this, this rains descend, the
[1:11:16] floods came and the winds blew. This
[1:11:18] represents all the most terrible trials
[1:11:21] that you can have in life
[1:11:25] and it blows upon your life.
[1:11:29] But if you're standing upon the word of
[1:11:33] God,
[1:11:35] you're not going to get bent out of
[1:11:37] shape.
[1:11:39] &gt;&gt; You're going to be standing
[1:11:42] You're you're not going to allow things
[1:11:44] to constantly get you off track and and
[1:11:48] and and and and
[1:11:52] cause you to be acting the same way you
[1:11:55] would if you were back in the world,
[1:11:58] right? Acting like the world like this
[1:12:01] shouldn't be happening
[1:12:04] like as if God is out of control or
[1:12:06] something.
[1:12:09] So we that happens because we don't take
[1:12:12] God's word and live by it every single
[1:12:15] day
[1:12:17] because that's what this means. You're
[1:12:19] building your house every single day.
[1:12:21] You don't build your house at church.
[1:12:25] You build your house every day when you
[1:12:26] get up and you say, "I want God to be in
[1:12:28] my life. I really want God to be in my
[1:12:31] life." Verse 26. And everyone that
[1:12:34] heareth the word of God
[1:12:38] and doesn't do it, hears these things of
[1:12:42] mine, and doeth them not, shall be
[1:12:44] likened unto a foolish person
[1:12:47] which built his house upon the sand. So
[1:12:52] it look, you know, like a a a decent
[1:12:55] house,
[1:12:57] but it won't stand. and the rains said,
[1:13:00] the floods came, the winds blew and beat
[1:13:01] upon the house and it fell and great was
[1:13:05] the fall of it.
[1:13:07] So you see it wasn't built upon the word
[1:13:11] of God.
[1:13:13] Like let's say for instance,
[1:13:15] brother Marty's a good example of this.
[1:13:18] I mean the I've I've never known brother
[1:13:21] Marty not to pay his tithe.
[1:13:26] Never in my entire life have I ever ever
[1:13:29] ever
[1:13:31] not seen him pay his tithe.
[1:13:34] Now, the Bible tells us that if we pay
[1:13:37] our tithes faithfully
[1:13:40] that we will be blessed beyond measure
[1:13:44] that we won't be able to contain the
[1:13:46] blessings of God. And if I was to ask
[1:13:49] brother Marty, brother Marty, have you
[1:13:51] been h what the blessings that came to
[1:13:53] you, did they come because other people
[1:13:56] gave you money? No.
[1:14:00] No. Because God is the one that does the
[1:14:03] blessings.
[1:14:05] But if we only pay our tithes part-time,
[1:14:10] half time, 3/4 time, we do not have the
[1:14:15] promise of being blessed as if we were
[1:14:17] faithful paying our tithes.
[1:14:21] &gt;&gt; So we build our house upon the word of
[1:14:24] God. We hear it, we do it, and we
[1:14:27] receive the blessings of it. And that's
[1:14:30] how simple it works. Except the Lord
[1:14:34] build your house. They labor in vain
[1:14:38] that build it. Except the Lord keep the
[1:14:40] city. The watchman waketh but in vain.
[1:14:44] We need God. We man must live by every
[1:14:48] word that proceedth out of the mouth of
[1:14:50] God.
[1:14:51] All right. Turn with me to Acts chapter
[1:14:54] 8. We have a couple. We're not going to
[1:14:56] be able to get through anything
[1:14:57] everything. But you know what's new?
[1:15:00] What is new about that? Right. We knew
[1:15:02] that. We know that's coming. We knew
[1:15:04] that before you were coming up here to
[1:15:05] the pulpit.
[1:15:07] Acts chapter 8 verse 26.
[1:15:13] And the angel of the Lord spake unto
[1:15:16] Philillip, saying, "Arise, and go toward
[1:15:20] the south, unto the way that goeth down
[1:15:23] from Jerusalem unto Gaza, which is
[1:15:27] desert." And he arose and went, behold,
[1:15:30] a man of Ethiopia, a unic of great
[1:15:32] authority under Candace, queen of
[1:15:35] Ethiopians,
[1:15:36] who had the charge of all her treasures,
[1:15:40] and had come to Jerusalem for to
[1:15:42] worship.
[1:15:44] And he was returning sitting in his
[1:15:46] chariot, and he read uh uh the book of
[1:15:49] Isaiah.
[1:15:51] And the spirit
[1:15:53] uh saith unto Philillip, go near and
[1:15:57] join thyself to this chariot. And Philip
[1:16:00] ran thither to him and heard him read uh
[1:16:04] the prophet uh Isaas and saith,
[1:16:08] understand
[1:16:10] thou what you're reading? Do you
[1:16:12] understand what you're reading in the
[1:16:13] Bible? And he said, "How can I
[1:16:17] understand except some man should guide
[1:16:21] me?"
[1:16:23] And he desiring Philillip that he would
[1:16:25] come up and sit with him. The place of
[1:16:28] the scripture which he read was this. He
[1:16:31] was led as sheep as a sheep to the
[1:16:35] slaughter. And like a lamb dumb before a
[1:16:38] shear, so opened he not his mouth. In
[1:16:41] his humiliation, his judgment was taken
[1:16:44] away. Who shall declare his generation?
[1:16:47] For his life is taken from the earth.
[1:16:50] And the unic answered Philillip and
[1:16:52] said, I pray thee, of whom speaketh the
[1:16:55] prophet this of himself or of some other
[1:16:58] man? And Philip opened his mouth and
[1:17:02] began at the same scripture and preached
[1:17:05] unto him Jesus.
[1:17:08] And as they went their way, they came
[1:17:10] into a certain water. And the unic said,
[1:17:12] "See here is water. What does hinder me
[1:17:15] to be baptized?" And Philip said, "If
[1:17:18] thou believe with all your heart,
[1:17:21] that's the first criteria. You got to
[1:17:23] believe with all your heart, thou
[1:17:25] mayaest." And he and he answered and
[1:17:28] said, "I believe that Jesus Christ is
[1:17:30] the son of God." And he commanded the
[1:17:32] chariot to stand still. And they went
[1:17:33] down in both into the water, both Philip
[1:17:36] and the unic. and he baptized him. And
[1:17:39] when he and when they were come up out
[1:17:42] of the water, the spirit of the Lord
[1:17:44] caught away Philillip that the unic saw
[1:17:46] him no more and he went on his way
[1:17:49] rejoicing and Philillip was found at
[1:17:52] Azotus and passing through he preached
[1:17:55] in the cities till he came to Cesaria.
[1:17:58] This is what I want to say. Did
[1:18:00] Philillip guide him?
[1:18:05] Did Philip guide him? This is I don't
[1:18:08] mean this to be a trick question. I mean
[1:18:10] in one sense Philip guided him the the
[1:18:13] unic but in another sense it was really
[1:18:16] God that was building the house in the
[1:18:18] unic and he just used Philillip to get
[1:18:22] the word to him. You understand what I'm
[1:18:24] saying? But it wasn't Philillip's oh I
[1:18:26] think I'm gonna go do this.
[1:18:29] It was being led by God,
[1:18:32] inspired by God to go do it.
[1:18:37] And God wants to be our guide.
[1:18:40] God wants to help us in our life, our
[1:18:43] everyday, everyday school, work,
[1:18:46] marriage, kids, parents. He wants to
[1:18:49] guide us in that because we don't know
[1:18:52] the way.
[1:18:54] But God knows the way and he wants to
[1:18:57] guide us there. But there has to be a
[1:18:59] real relationship. You know, a lot of
[1:19:01] times I believe God comes and speaks to
[1:19:05] us and we don't know it is God.
[1:19:10] I mean, brother Dennis was speaking in
[1:19:12] our our men's meeting talking about a
[1:19:14] lot of times God is speaking to us, but
[1:19:16] we're not listening.
[1:19:19] He's telling us what to do, but we got a
[1:19:21] better idea. We want to do something
[1:19:23] different.
[1:19:26] And so often, you know, people made the
[1:19:28] decisions, "Oh, I don't need church
[1:19:30] anymore."
[1:19:32] They're listening to a wrong voice.
[1:19:36] &gt;&gt; They may in their mind be able to say,
[1:19:38] "Well, this is why, but that ain't the
[1:19:40] way of that ain't the word way."
[1:19:43] &gt;&gt; You'll never find a church, never find a
[1:19:46] church without problems.
[1:19:51] &gt;&gt; And you know what? Problems build
[1:19:53] character.
[1:19:55] Right? I mean, can you imagine having
[1:19:58] seven kids?
[1:20:02] And since the kids couldn't get along, I
[1:20:04] said, "Yeah, you all got to sit in
[1:20:05] different houses."
[1:20:08] No, they had to learn to work together
[1:20:12] and work through things. And you know
[1:20:14] what I did most of my time?
[1:20:17] Taught them how to work together.
[1:20:20] You can't leave them by theirel to
[1:20:22] figure it out.
[1:20:24] They need a guide. This is how you
[1:20:26] handle this. This is what you do in this
[1:20:29] situation.
[1:20:31] And then they learn to do that next
[1:20:33] time. And sometimes you got to keep
[1:20:36] doing it and keep doing it. And
[1:20:38] sometimes it don't seem like they some
[1:20:40] of them get it, right?
[1:20:43] But but you keep working with them
[1:20:46] because there's no chance that they're
[1:20:48] going to get it if you don't work with
[1:20:50] them.
[1:20:52] We all need a guide. Brother Brandham
[1:20:55] taught us that we parents are the Holy
[1:20:58] Ghost to our children until they get it.
[1:21:01] Now, here's some I've got some children,
[1:21:03] they're adults now.
[1:21:05] They got the Holy Ghost. And I've got
[1:21:07] some children that don't have the Holy
[1:21:09] Ghost. Some adult children that don't
[1:21:11] have the Holy Ghost, but I'm still the
[1:21:14] Holy Ghost to them
[1:21:16] until they get the Holy Ghost.
[1:21:19] You understand? We all need a guide. We
[1:21:22] need a guide. And I I I think the
[1:21:25] greatest thing we could do is get the
[1:21:26] Holy Ghost at the earliest age that we
[1:21:28] can.
[1:21:31] Turn with me if you would to First
[1:21:32] Corinthians chapter 3.
[1:21:37] 1 Corinthians chapter 3.
[1:21:41] And starting with verse number one. And
[1:21:44] you know this is a funny thing, but I
[1:21:45] I'm not hearing the pages of the Bible.
[1:21:48] You know, turn And I think we should be
[1:21:51] hearing the pages, you know, of the
[1:21:52] Bible's turn and and not not not relying
[1:21:56] on this. Um, the only reason this is for
[1:22:00] this is for our visitors when they don't
[1:22:02] bring their Bible.
[1:22:06] No, God God bless you. Just at least
[1:22:09] write it down and go back to read it
[1:22:12] when you can when you're at home. And I
[1:22:15] and I, brethren, I could not speak unto
[1:22:18] you as as you were spiritual,
[1:22:23] but as uh as unto carnal, even as unto
[1:22:28] babes in Christ. I have fed you with
[1:22:32] milk and not with meat. For hitherto you
[1:22:36] were not able to to actually eat the
[1:22:38] meat. And neither yet now are you able
[1:22:43] to to eat it. Everybody understands that
[1:22:47] a baby cannot eat meat.
[1:22:50] It can only take milk. It has to get to
[1:22:54] a certain age and then they got to start
[1:22:57] they got to you know
[1:23:00] get Gerber baby food and you get the
[1:23:04] squash that's
[1:23:08] you don't and the the the potatoes and
[1:23:10] the peas and and it all just looks like
[1:23:13] yuck, right? And then they get a little
[1:23:16] bit older and then there's this plate
[1:23:18] and you take a couple peas and you go
[1:23:20] like this and they're able to and they
[1:23:24] build their weight up to eating meat.
[1:23:28] And so it is with Christians.
[1:23:30] Sometimes they're not able to stomach
[1:23:33] that they can pay their tithes
[1:23:36] because they don't have enough trust in
[1:23:38] God Almighty.
[1:23:41] They have to wait till all the bills are
[1:23:43] paid and then they'll pay their tithes.
[1:23:46] They're still babes in Christ.
[1:23:50] But there comes to a place where we put
[1:23:53] away
[1:23:55] these things and we just take God at his
[1:23:57] word.
[1:23:58] &gt;&gt; And there's no longer I have to
[1:24:01] understand it or feel it or agree. I
[1:24:05] know it's the truth. I'm going to do it.
[1:24:08] That's a person you can feed me.
[1:24:12] You may go to church for six months. You
[1:24:15] may go to church for 16 years. It don't
[1:24:18] make you any more able. It just all
[1:24:21] depends on where your heart is at.
[1:24:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:24:24] &gt;&gt; All right. Verse number three.
[1:24:28] For ye are yet carnal.
[1:24:32] For whereas there is among you, now he's
[1:24:36] defining what a carnal person is,
[1:24:38] envying,
[1:24:40] strife,
[1:24:42] divisions.
[1:24:45] Are ye not carnal Christians? And you
[1:24:48] walk as men and not even as believers.
[1:24:51] In other words, believers should never
[1:24:53] have envy and strife divisions. Can you
[1:24:56] say amen to that? I
[1:24:57] &gt;&gt; think we can say amen to that. For while
[1:25:01] one saith, "Oh, I like this church. I
[1:25:05] like that church. I'm a Paul. I'm
[1:25:08] another. I am of Apollos. Are you not
[1:25:13] carnal?
[1:25:15] For then is who is Paul? Who then is
[1:25:18] Paul? And who is Apollos?
[1:25:21] But ministers by whom you believed,
[1:25:24] even as the Lord gave to every man.
[1:25:28] I have planted Apollos watered
[1:25:32] but God is the one that gives the
[1:25:34] increase in her life.
[1:25:37] So then neither is he that planteth
[1:25:40] anything
[1:25:41] or or or neither he that waterth
[1:25:45] but God that giveth the increase. So I
[1:25:48] like this. Here's Paul talking to a real
[1:25:50] carnal church and he says, "You know
[1:25:52] what? I'm nothing.
[1:25:55] I'm nothing. Just because I plant, I'm
[1:25:57] still nothing. And and and and he need
[1:25:59] that water. They're nothing
[1:26:02] because God is the one that's got to
[1:26:04] give the increase.
[1:26:06] Amen.
[1:26:09] &gt;&gt; Now, um let's let's continue on. Now, he
[1:26:12] that planteth and he that waterth are
[1:26:15] one,
[1:26:16] and everyone shall receive his own
[1:26:19] reward according to his own labor. So if
[1:26:23] there is a person, he's planting a lot
[1:26:24] of seed
[1:26:26] and then there's somebody whose waters
[1:26:28] like only half of the time, the one
[1:26:32] who's doing work all the time, he's
[1:26:34] going to receive a greater reward on the
[1:26:36] other side. Not this side necessarily,
[1:26:38] it's on the other side. That's where you
[1:26:41] because down here things don't seem to
[1:26:43] be fair, right? Plus, we don't know all
[1:26:44] that we're doing till we get to the
[1:26:46] other side.
[1:26:48] For we have we are laborers together
[1:26:50] with God. Ye are God's husbandry
[1:26:54] and ye are and you are God's building. I
[1:26:57] want to get to this. You are God's
[1:26:58] building and God's building you, right?
[1:27:00] For we are laborers together with God.
[1:27:03] We don't labor in vain. We don't say,
[1:27:06] "Well, you know, that that that that
[1:27:09] minister is carnal or or or that that
[1:27:11] person is carnal or I don't want to talk
[1:27:13] to them because of this or there's
[1:27:16] strife, there's envy. Uh I I I got a
[1:27:18] problem over here." You don't do that.
[1:27:20] That's carnal. What you do is you lay
[1:27:23] down your life to help that person.
[1:27:26] I don't know how to help them. Then
[1:27:27] spend more time in prayer
[1:27:30] because we got to learn to start helping
[1:27:33] and building
[1:27:35] according to the grace of God which is
[1:27:37] given unto me. Now Paul's calling
[1:27:39] himself a master builder. I have laid
[1:27:43] the foundation and another build
[1:27:45] thereon. But let every man take heed how
[1:27:48] he build thereon. I want you to
[1:27:50] understand when Paul's saying here I am
[1:27:52] a master builder uh the Bible tells us
[1:27:55] that we uh that we are built upon the
[1:28:00] foundation o of of the apostles Jesus
[1:28:04] Christ himself being the chief the
[1:28:07] foundation and the chief cornerstone as
[1:28:09] it were. So when when Paul's talking
[1:28:12] here I am the wise master builder he
[1:28:14] wrote 14 books of the New Testament.
[1:28:16] That is really God in Paul as a master
[1:28:20] builder.
[1:28:21] &gt;&gt; It isn't Paul taking the place of God.
[1:28:24] Because remember, unless unless the Lord
[1:28:28] build the house, they labor in vain that
[1:28:32] build it.
[1:28:34] So Paul, he was doing exactly what God
[1:28:37] told him to do. Now when when Paul was
[1:28:40] building God's house, what was he doing?
[1:28:44] He was persecuting the church. He was
[1:28:46] killing Christians,
[1:28:49] right? He was getting letters that he
[1:28:51] can kill everybody that was trying to
[1:28:53] walk with God. That was that was Saul.
[1:28:58] That was Saul building God's church. And
[1:29:00] God took him and he slapped him across
[1:29:02] the face and threw him off his horse and
[1:29:05] said, "What are you doing? You're you're
[1:29:07] you're kicking against the pricks. It's
[1:29:10] you're you're you're not helping me.
[1:29:12] You're persecuting me.
[1:29:14] And God got a hold
[1:29:18] of of of Saul. And Saul got serious with
[1:29:21] God. And you know what he did? He got so
[1:29:24] serious that he spent three and a half
[1:29:26] years seeking the Holy Ghost.
[1:29:33] And he knew the word like nobody knew
[1:29:35] it. His taught under the great teacher
[1:29:37] of Galia.
[1:29:39] But he sought to get the teacher inside
[1:29:41] of him.
[1:29:43] And then everything began to make sense.
[1:29:46] That's why Paul could write the New
[1:29:48] Testament, bring out scriptures from the
[1:29:49] Old and tie it in and show this is Jesus
[1:29:52] Christ
[1:29:55] because he had the guide. He was the
[1:29:57] master build. He laid the foundation. He
[1:29:59] got the 14 books of the Bible
[1:30:02] according verse 10 um verse uh verse 10.
[1:30:07] According to the grace of God given unto
[1:30:08] me as a wise master build, I laid the
[1:30:10] foundation another build. said, "Let
[1:30:11] every man take heed how he build
[1:30:13] thereon." In other words, make sure you
[1:30:15] do exactly what I said. In fact, one
[1:30:18] place he said, "If an angel come
[1:30:20] ministering any other thing that I
[1:30:22] preached unto you, let him be accursed.
[1:30:24] If any man preaches any other thing that
[1:30:26] I've already laid, let him be accursed.
[1:30:30] For other foundation can no man lay than
[1:30:33] that is laid, which is Jesus Christ."
[1:30:35] Now if any man build upon this
[1:30:37] foundation, gold, silver, precious
[1:30:39] stone, wood, hay, and stubble, what is
[1:30:42] that referring to?
[1:30:44] Natural things,
[1:30:49] our own understanding, our own figuring
[1:30:51] out, our own analyzing, our own
[1:30:53] intellect.
[1:30:55] But every man's work shall be made
[1:30:58] manifest. For the day shall declare it,
[1:31:01] because it shall be revealed by what?
[1:31:04] Test and trials,
[1:31:07] and fire shall try every man's work of
[1:31:10] what sort it is. If you want to know
[1:31:12] what you really have,
[1:31:14] it's real simple. Go through a trial and
[1:31:17] see how you act.
[1:31:19] Anybody can say, "Praise God," when
[1:31:22] things are going the way you want to go.
[1:31:24] But you you know you go through trials
[1:31:26] and all of a sudden there's murmuring,
[1:31:28] there's complaining, there's upset,
[1:31:30] there's excuses. I don't feel like doing
[1:31:32] it
[1:31:33] because a trial manifests what's on the
[1:31:36] inside. That's what trials do. They
[1:31:40] reveal to you where you're standing.
[1:31:43] And so when you know you're standing,
[1:31:45] you can say, "God, help me. Fill me with
[1:31:47] more of you." Amen. Let's stand
[1:31:49] together. God bless you.
[1:31:53] So, I don't know if you're going to be
[1:31:54] happy about this or sad, but we probably
[1:31:57] have 10 more scriptures that we didn't
[1:31:59] do.
[1:32:05] Praise the Lord.
[1:32:22] Can we Can we sing each step of the way?
[1:32:26] I I want you to know it's on your list
[1:32:28] of songs that you can play by ear.
[1:32:33] In fact, there was one last service that
