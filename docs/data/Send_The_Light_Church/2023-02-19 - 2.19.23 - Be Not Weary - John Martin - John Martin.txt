little ten percent let us give it to him he's worthy of that says glorify him everything we do let's glorify it's the least that we can do for him it's a reasonable sacrifice a reasonable service let us just rise and like this to take these tithes before the Lord this is about our heads oh gracious Heavenly Father we just think thank you you're The Giver of Life you just put the breath in our body

John may we receive it into our hearts Lord that we could just manifest the word that you just manifested unto us Lord and we thank you for all things and we just praise you Lord for all things and we ask it all in your most holy precious name in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen let us remain standing as we invite our precious brother up and we'll sing only believe that's all we have to do receive

to receive from the Lord in just five minutes in his presence can do more good than all the efforts that we could take of trying to get to God just five minutes our effort should be just getting into the spirit getting into his presence that he can help us and meet our needs I say God bless you to each of you that have gathered today our hearts go out to those that are a suffering illness and um we've been praying and we'll continue to pray amen that God would just give a speedy recovery and and and and help them amen I also want to remember the the Helms family I'm not sure if there's a request they got in but let's just remember to pray for the the needs there in the family um that God would just intervene amen amen turn with me if you would to the book of Galatians chapter 3 or Galatians chapter 6 starting with verse number three amen how many is thankful for the word you know it doesn't matter what what vessel God uses the word is precious amen amen before we begin reading let's look to our Heavenly Father in prayer I wonder if there be anyone here today that say please remember me in prayer amen God bless these hands amen Heavenly Father we come to you as humbly as we know at this moment Lord would you just cleanse us of all of our unrighteousness all of our sin all of our unbelief all of our thoughts our Deeds anything that has grieved you has made you turned your head has made you to find displeasure in us we just pray that the blood of Jesus would cover us at this time Lord that we could all stand here in your presence in pure right righteousness Lord you said when you stand praying forgive Lord we forgive those who trespass against us Lord we just want to be so connected to you this morning Lord we don't want to miss anything that you would have for us and I pray Lord that you would could encourage us and strengthen us through your word today and help us in our journey father pray that you blessed your word and give us the Revelation that we have need of personally we'll be careful to give you praise not or throughout this day the days to come in Jesus name we pray amen amen Galatians chapter 6 during verse number three um for if a man thinketh himself to be something when he is nothing he deceiveth himself so I I believe that's capable of doing but let every man prove his own work and then shall he have rejoicing in himself alone and not in another for every man shall bear his own burden let him that is taught in the word communicate unto him that teacheth in all good things be not deceived God is Not mocked for whatsoever a man soweth that shall he also reap for he that soweth to his flesh shall of the flesh reap corruption but he that soweth to the spirit shall of the spirit reap life Everlasting amen let us not be weary in well-doing for in due season we shall reap if we faint not and let's continue the same theme and we have there as we have therefore opportunity let us do good unto all men especially unto them who are of the household of faith amen God bless you may be seated we want to take our our text this morning from verse number nine and let us not be weary and well doing for in due season we shall reap if we faint not entitled this be not weary we certainly living in an hour where weariness is easy to come by just taking what these words mean in the Hebrew or I'm sorry in the in the Greek and let us not be weak in virtuous doings and virtuous doings for in the appointed time or the set time we shall Harvest if we relax not if we don't get comfortable if we don't allow laodicea to get a hold now we're going to be probably touching on a few different things and our goal is not necessarily to get every single thing but to get every single thing that God has for us and uh I want to start here by talking about uh sewing because we all sew right we're all sores and um usually when we think of sewing it's one time in the spring and that we harvest in the fall but when it comes to sowing to God I want us to think about commitment because commitment plays a big role in uh what we're really sowing when we sow our seed our seed ourselves our heart on to the Lord we either sow all of our heart all of our life or we sow a mixed seed in other words we we we go through the motions of giving our heart to God of repentance but we do not surrender everything we get tricked by the enemy and only time tells we really don't know how sincere or how real seeds are when they're sold or when people give their hearts to the Lord but as they mature they automatically um manifest what kind of sea they are for the law of God is that every seed will bring forth of its own kind amen amen we understand that God cannot be deceived we can't pull a fast one over on God but we can become deceived thinking that we gave all of our heart to God when reality we ended up sowing some of our seed sowing some of our heart to our flesh right and it's not as easy as just why repented I got baptized that we should be there no it is different because this is a serious thing with her heart because God is requiring that we love him with all of our might with all of our soul with all that's within us to to put him first to keep him first and and to make God the center of your life of course Satan's on the other hand he wants anything but that that's true so everything has a seed in it The Good the Bad and the Ugly everything's got a seed in it and when we came to Christ and gave him a heart and our life that was a seed whether we were completely sincere or a total hypocrite or somewhere in between it was a seed oh what was the seed that we planted we should all be able to look at our life and see what we planted right and all I'm doing is trying to provoke some thoughts at this time did we mean business with God was this life in death to us at the time that we did it did we surrender all of our life to him or was the seed mixed with some selfishness were we just trying to get eternal life and that was the main scenario but our life being lit for him wasn't in our thoughts as much as it should be we know that the pure word seed will manifest pure word if you sow word word is coming amen amen every seed brings forth of its own kind even the word of God it does not matter what we've done in the past it doesn't matter the horrible things that we've done or what we went through it doesn't matter if we have a terrible reputation from our past it doesn't matter if we sow our heart unto Christ it will come forth a child of God the only thing that matters is the condition of the heart not the past that's right so it's not about being good enough it's about being sincere enough true enough giving your heart to God Amen how sincere how pure and how in love you are with God and how much you want the truth these are the things that matters to God the word of God can only help us if the condition of our heart is right now this is you know you you plant a a tomato in the ground it'll come forth a tomato you plant a tomato in a pot it'll come forth a tomato if you plant it in a in a flower in a bed a raised bed it'll come forth to Tomato because it is a seed but when it comes to the word of God it just does not come forth wherever you have to have a right condition in your heart it has to go through three more agency so that's it's not good enough to be in a church that preaches the truth it's not good enough it won't get you there it only provides you an opportunity because without it it can't you've got it brother Brian says you've got to have a good betting ground if if if not then that means all the egos will stay in the barnyard right but when they hear the cry they come out they fly out when they hear that truth amen amen because God has something greater that's why the Bible tells us that we need to be more ready to hear the word of God emphasis needs to be put more on the condition of our heart and not how well the word is preached now Jesus taught us that the word has different effects on heart conditions and some of you know we preached on this before called heart conditions and one of the heart conditions that people come to church with is Wayside their heart just isn't there their mind isn't there their heart isn't there they just come and they sit down because it's Church and you you're not going to receive very much from the Lord in that condition uh in fact the devil can use that to really torment you honestly right the other heart condition that you can have and the word really not do you as much good as it should as a Stony heart and that heart has hard spots in it uh perhaps something you've got against somebody something that somebody's done to you maybe uh you've just been a little stubborn towards God you just a little bit rebellious not not yielding your life to God this creates a hardness in the heart of a Believer when he comes to church and he hears the word and it can keep him from the word making a complete effect Jesus said they that have a strongly heart they receive the word with joy as they still say Amen to the word but they don't have much root in themselves because they don't have much root in themselves they only last a while and they go back to the way they were and this is this it we we need to be thinking about the word having a permanent effect in our life and not a temporary effect he says for when tribulation or persecution arises because of the word by and by He Is offended all happens with the Stony heart now a thorny heart this is a a heart that is mixed with other things when they're hearing the preaching of the word in other words they come in they want to hear the word of God but there's already other things in their heart besides wanting to be here at church it isn't first in their hearts this isn't first in their life this is a very common one for the believer's battle they come to church to hear the word indeed but they're not really sold out to the word it's mixed Jesus said the cares of this world and the deceitfulness of riches choke out the word and they become unfruitful so see the word is okay and they even receive the word they even say Amen but there's other things that are in the person's heart in life outside of the church doors So eventually you know what happens when you have too many weeds in your garden it can really stunt the growth and choke out the good stuff that's why we weed our Gardens and we need to learn to weed out the things that Satan is constantly trying to throw in our life amen amen everyone gets caught up with the cares of this world and if Satan can't get you there he'll he'll try to deceive you with money or things just things that will choke out the word now the other heart condition is the only one that really brings forth the word that's being preached and it Remains the Bible says Jesus said it's a good heart condition it's the only condition that will manifest the word not just this week but this year next year it'll stay it'll remain that's what what it really means to grow is when that word remains with you and it takes it takes not just depending on God to preach the right word to us but the condition of our heart to receive it okay we need Revelation there's no doubt about it we need it but the thing is God is hid Revelation from the wise and prudent and he's chosen to review it to a certain group a certain group there he calls them babes we call them elect he calls them babes but it's a condition it's a humbleness a humble and contrite spirit I'll not despise we need to come into His presence like Esther not like vashti vashti thought she just deserved everything Esther realized she didn't deserve anything and yet he was trying to give her up to half the kingdom a sincere heart that is not mixed with other things a good heart where the love of God is so deep it's our only motivation for being here now Jesus warned us about the cares of the world sneaking in in Luke 21 there's a number of scriptures that are not going to come up on the board and I hope that's okay but just really one you know a lot of these scriptures and if you need them you can go back just just write write them down Jesus said and take heed to yourself lest that anytime your hearts be overcharged with surfeiting and drunkenness and the cares of this life and so that day come upon you unawares in other words we should realize what's going on in this world and it ain't stopping right that's true it's continuing to go down the tubes for as a snare shall come upon all them that dwell on the face of the whole earth that includes us amen watch ye therefore and pray always that's the only way you can be kind of worthy to escape all the things that shall come to pass and stand before the son of man amen how we need to be more prepared when we come into church to hear the word not just say well make it there for the preaching no get in that prayer closet don't assume your heart is good enough because you said a couple prayers get in there and spend some time with God we need to have some self-examination I think it would do our spiritual life a lot of good if we would just take the time and inspect the fruits of our life take a greater interest in making sure that we've got the same intentions today that we did when we first got baptized remember how sincere we were remember how we were just I just want to please you Lord I just want this thing to be right and and you had others that were speaking to you that were already Believers and they tried to encourage you making sure that uh your past was the past and that everything was under the blood and you you you wanted to be sure that you're going to March forward with the Lord remember that even we need to take a look and see if we're there today on a regular basis are we just as determined are we willing to give just as much are we willing to lay down our lives for him are we willing to stand the same track of love the same commitment as we were at the beginning or did we get off track somewhere are we just assuming everything's the same that's why Jesus said he that endureth to the end the same shall be saved amen sir that's why the Bible says where the tree the way the tree falleth that's the way it's going to lie that's right that's why the Bible says our Salvation is nearer than when we first believe that's why we need to continue to work out our salvation with fear and trembling it's not a done deal yet because he that soweth to the Flesh show of the flesh reap corruption but he that soweth to the spirit shall of the spirit reap life Everlasting amen you know Jesus said that the father seeketh such that will worship Him in spirit and Truth so there's certain worship that isn't really from the heart fact he said in vain do they do worship me they're they're their heart is far from me and so it is easy to say praise the Lord just like it's pretty easy to say sorry but it's much harder to be sorry and it's much harder to praise God from the heart if you can confidently say that you were 100 percent when you gave your heart to Christ and you can say that today I am in the same place I am 100 committed to Christ I say then today Shake the Dust off your feet and move forward we've all allowed things to creep into our lives at times since our original commitment to the Lord we've all wanted to take a back seat in the church no offense to those of you that are in the back seat today but you know how it is the sign brother Marty and I used to see when we went to the other Church I come early if you want a c i see a back seat in church make sure you come early because for some reason more people want to sit in the back seat than they do the front seat but you understand what I'm saying nothing against all stain in the back seat but that Spirit of just I kind of want to sit in the back we all should better say Amen to that we've all allowed something to swallow our time up right amen we've all been consumed with our problems so much that we just don't hardly have time to help Jesus save Souls we've all felt like we've been so far from God that we felt backslidden that we didn't even want to go to church we didn't want to pray we didn't want to even talk to somebody we really didn't want to Humble ourselves to the word of God and we thought we were doing some great Deed by just making it to church come on we're humans with lots of flaws and they're not going away until we're out of here amen God knows we're frail God knows we have to deal with a lot of stuff in these bodies God knows that we get weary from all the junk that we have to deal with all the garbage that's in this world and God has a rest for the weary do you believe that a lot of people just want rest for their bodies and their situations but God has promised us a rest for our souls and we've read this scripture in Matthew 11 28 come unto me all ye that labor and heavy laden I will give you rest so where does our rest come from it comes from Christ right we got to come to him in other words we've got to not not just come to church but come to him at church take my yoke upon you and learn to me for a meek and lowly in heart ye shall find rest not for your your situations in the world rest for your souls for my yoke is easy and my burden is light now we understand that Jesus is really referring to those who are seeking God in these scriptures because if you go right before him he's talking about he hid it from the wise and prudent and and he's and he it's up to God to whom he reveals and people are seeking God that's why the Bible says many will seek and shall not be able to enter in many because they're they're not going to they're going to get weary they're going to quit they feel fatigued from the toil of laboring overburdened what do I got to do to get a hold of this God that everybody tells me so real and Jesus tells them to take his yoke which is the word how simple Amen to let the word become real to you only you can take this word and bind it upon your neck only you can say I I I humble myself I let this word be my headship amen amen only you can say I will make it real to me because if you don't do that you'll sit in church and you'll think who are you to tell me that you'll do one or the other either the word will be your head or it won't be it needs to be the center of our life I want to touch a little bit on becoming weary not from the world not from the hardships in the world but from doing good because that's what our scripture says amen should we go back and read that all right verse 9 and let us not be weary in well doing you can get weary from doing well God knows it can wear us down when you go the Second Mile all the time when you're turning your cheek over and over and over when you're helping those who love you less that's what hate means when they love you less when they have despitefully used you and they've spoken ill of you that it can become weary when you keep doing good when you keep doing virtuous things are you with me it could become very weary fighting the good fight of faith come weary resisting the devil on every hand when you're supposed to stay true to the word keep your flesh under subjection I'm telling you these are virtuous things these are doing good and it can become weary God knows that we get weary in well-doing trying to help people who really don't even care enough to help themselves trying to serve and serve and serve and serve feeling it isn't accomplishing what we thought it was going to copy is anybody here with me can anybody relate to what I'm saying God knows how weary it gets spending time with others laying your life down for others reaching out to save Souls helping to establish someone from from their old life to become more faithful to God more faithful to the word they become established as a Christian not based on some religion or some idea or some opinion but based on the word of God the one that Paul tells us how to be as a Christian as the prophet told us in this age how to be a Christian it's much different than our ideas it's much different than our feelings and become weary trying to maintain doing good things God knows and he's perfect he's provided I'll say it like this the Ferguson's family we heard the kids are taking prescriptions right when we get sick sometimes we want to take a prescription when it just we can't shake it off are you with me well there's certain things that you know we just can't shake off sometimes but God has provided a prescription for us praise God Amen we can find it in Isaiah chapter 40 verse 28. it's a prescription for all of us who get weary from doing good you can get weary from the world or you can get weary from doing good Isaiah chapter 40 verse 28 says has thou not known has thou not heard that the Everlasting God the Lord the Creator think about this of the Earth fainteth not neither is weary there's no searching for his understanding he is awesome and he giveth power to the faint and to them that have no might he increaseth strength he turns up the power amen he turns the throttle up even the you shall faint and be weary and the young men shall utterly fall but they that wait upon the Lord shall renew their strength they shall Mount up with wings as eagles they shall run and not be weary and they shall walk and not faint thank you Lord now that word wait it really means to bind together as you Tarry upon the Lord as you spend time praying as you spend time waiting for God's presence to come it us it isn't until his presence comes inside of you that you get strength come on man amen when the Holy Spirit binds together with your heart that is when your strength increases but you gotta wait and I tell you when you're weary when you're weary from doing good and you just don't seem like you can do any more good it is really hard to keep waiting keep waiting when you're flying on all clouds on all cylinders and everything seems to be real good well it's not a problem to spend that hour in prayer but when you're doing down when you're down and you're discouraging you just can't seem to get anywhere that's the hardest time to keep waiting until the presence of God comes and binds with your heart and gives you the strength that you need hey but you got to wait until he comes until he binds together with you because just staying there and waiting there and praying there for 10 minutes or or whatever doesn't always get the job done I'll say most the time don't get the job done sometimes you just feel more worse did you ever pray and didn't feel the presence of God and you kind of get up and you feel worse because you know you didn't get into his presence you know you're getting up too quick you know you should be staying down there longer the more that you yield to his presence the more strength you will get the more you will increase in strength the stronger you'll be his strength is perfect in our weakness when we can just get so weak so needy that God I'm not going anywhere until you come well then he'll bind with you we've all felt the presence of God and when you get out of there you're like a royal lion you may go into that prayer room like a little kitty but you'll come out like a lion you'll run and not be weary you're not faint now I don't care if we're 14 or 95 strength still will renew us he's all we need him he's all we need but it's not until his presence comes and binds with you it's got to bind with you because you know right now there is no problem with God's strength he doesn't lose strength here and there he doesn't go through trials and feel whipped out we do so but we've got to bind with that we've got to Humble ourselves and seek the Lord and spend time waiting on him we just can't go through the motions of our prayer and go through the motions of reading go through the emotions of listening to go through the motions of church we've got to get serious with God amen stay there long enough think too often we're not willing to wait on the Lord long enough this is not the time to be running on fumes right we've got to get to the filling station and get filled up remember what happened to the foolish virgins they did not take enough all with them and they just we ran out of fumes ran on fumes and just finally ran out now we've all experienced what happens when we get low of the Holy Ghost we start running out of strength to work for the Lord start making excuses we run out of joy to live for others we begin to relax spiritually but I say to the bride be not weary in well-doing because that's what the scripture has told us this morning and let us not be weary and well doing for in due season we shall reap if we faint not in other words there's a possibility to faint there's a possibility for us to get relaxed be not weary and well-doing it's no time to relax it's no time to allow a laodicea's spirit get upon us from doing virtuous things no time to let the bars down it's no time to allow yourself to remain in a weak state that you can't be your best for God he was his best for us we need to be our best for God Amen it's no time to be concerned about yourself sometimes we just get It's All About Us well when does that stop the eye is never satisfied with seeing the ear with hearing every the the flesh is always want more It's never enough we always got to take care of ourselves there's not enough money in the bank there's not enough houses and enough boats there's not enough lures there's not enough guns there's not enough there's not enough it's no time to only be it's no time to be flirting with the world Amen let us not be weak in virtuous doings for in the appointed time we shall reap if we don't take it easy God is promised us that if we keep doing virtuous things that we're gonna we're gonna reap all the things that we've sold for God think about that your seeds are spiritual seeds of course when you sow to the flesh it's it's a carnal seed right it's spiritual but it's carnal when I because the the Devil he's spiritual but he's carnal you know what I'm saying we got to keep on being faithful to the word of God we got to keep sincerely in love with God we can't let that slip away even though the devil keeps telling you it really doesn't matter you don't really have to be sincerely in love it doesn't really matter God knows we got to keep listening to the message tapes even though you don't have enough time you got to keep coming to church Faithfully even though things are trying to interfere we need to keep paying our tithes even though the money is tight you need to keep sharing Christ with unbelievers even though the majority of them are going to reject Christ and reject us let us not be weak in virtuous doings for in the set time we shall reap if we don't start relaxing you know it's so easy to let other things kind of creep in and as soon as they do we're going to miss out on the promises are you with me for you have those of us that have made God preeminent in our life and at the times we've all had God preeminental life and I trust today that every one of us God is preeminent in her life your heart will be full of joy it will be a joy to be his servant you will be a love slave to him you'll be a prisoner for Christ it'll be an honor to give up your will and your time for him sir but we must let his presence have preeminence inside of us keep sowing for Jesus the Harvest will come for he that soweth to his flesh shall of the flesh reap corruption but he that soweth to the spirit shall of the spirit reap everlasting life let us not be weary in well-doing for in due season we shall reap if we faint not and as we have therefore opportunity let us do good unto all men especially unto them who are of the household of faith most people who know me know what I think about opportunity a man that wasn't afraid to work a man that didn't give up a man that had a vision who believed he would reap in due season Thomas Edison he said opportunity is missed by most people because it is dressed in overhauls and it looks like work you know Satan wants to discourage us from doing good because it's dressed in overhauls it looks like work and you gotta just keep loving when nobody's loving you you got to keep giving when nobody's giving to you you've got to keep washing feet when nobody's washing your feet it has been often quoted that he he tried and failed like a thousand times before reaping success anybody heard that I read that he failed 2774 times according to his records before reaching a working design of the electric light bulb that's what we need to have as Christians now he's doing that for a natural life how much more ought we to do that for a spiritual light here's another man that had a whole list of failures it was Abraham Lincoln he lost his job in 1832. he was defeated for the state legis legister in the same year he failed in business the following year his sweetheart died two years later in 1835 he had a nervous breakdown the following year he was defeated for speaker in 1838 he was defeated for nomination for the Congress in 1843. he lost the nomination in 1848 he was rejected for a land officer in 1849. he was defeated for the U.S Senate in 1854. he was defeated for a nomination for the Vice President in 1856 and again he was defeated for the U.S Senate in 1858. what I mean what a terrible record but he was elected painted but God has given us a clear message today let us not be weary and well doing for in due season we shall reap if we faint not and as we have therefore opportunity let us do good unto all men boy that's a that's I'll tell you you've got to be sold out when all men you're looking to do good amen especially unto them who are of the household of faith that's that's us amen I think some have become weary of doing good things for others I think so especially those of the household of faith don't get discouraged don't be weary God is always on time and he has an appointed time to bless you just don't start relaxing don't that is not the will of the Lord Abraham Lincoln was ordained by God to be president at the time that he was not before and not after you can't let your failures Define who you really are Abraham Lincoln did not tell you the bride won't amen amen what you were ordained to do for God and his kingdom you cannot let all the problems that are transpiring in your life stand in the way and Define you from what God has ordained you and called you to be when you think about our Father Abraham he was ordained by God to have a son in his old age and every year that went by kind of think about Abraham and Lincoln and type here it just got harder and harder to believe the promise can you imagine Abraham Lincoln ever thinking he'd be just there was just something inside of him that felt to be a leader but in his efforts he just kept being defeated it's just things kept happening and every year that went by and things went wrong something inside of him just kept moving forward and the same thing that happened to our father of Faith Abraham every year that kept what going by things got harder he kept getting older he kept looking for ways to see his promised come he tried natural hey what about my servant my home and what about uh Hagar and he he looking for these natural ways to bring about God's promise and it don't work friends try it all hope was against him all his ideas had failed but Abraham believed in hope the Bible says against hope amen imagine what would have happened if he would have gave up he would have just quit Stop Believing Romans tells us 419 and being not weak in faith he considered not his own body now dead when he was about a hundred years old neither yet the deadness of Sarah's womb he staggered not at the promise of God through unbelief but was strong in faith giving glory to God and being fully persuaded that he that what he had promised he was able also to perform now this is what we must be Abraham was our father we are Sons and Daughters of Abraham the same seed of Faith written out of the natural seed we're on the spiritual seed and that seed is by faith we've got to keep pressing in we've got to keep fighting the good fight of Faith we've got to press towards the Mart for the high calling that this calling is only for the bride the High Calling is for the bride it isn't for everybody unfortunately many are called few are chosen nah it's not up to me or you to say who's in and who's out but I'm here to tell you only the bride will press towards that Mark everybody else is going to relax look at laodicea they are so relaxed they're so lukewarm all you got to do is come to church and say I've done my deed for the day it's good enough I'm in need of nothing the children of Israel got weary in the wilderness but not Joshua and Caleb they were persuaded to receive God's promise I trust this morning that you are determined to receive the promise [Music] now look I know that we've all been we've all failed the Lord we've all had bad attitudes we've all kind of declined into uh I don't feel like trying any harder than I'm doing I understand that but don't let that be your present state you're really if you do that you're really showing what you are right because this is the hour that we need to stand for Jesus amen amen we need to stand up for the word we need to stand up and tell the devil who we are where we're going who we belong to and that you got a revelation otherwise he's going to just pull you around drag you through the mud Hebrews chapter 10 verse 35. now this one I want you to read so it's going to go up on the board Hebrews 10 verse 35 cast not away therefore your confidence which have great recompense of reward so what has reward your confidence that's why you got to maintain your confidence the confidence is what gives you the reward if you let your confidence slip if you stop getting excited you know David said one thing if I desired of the Lord and that will I seek after he had confidence that when he went to church he wasn't going to hear from some man he was going to hear from God almighty and God showed him a lot of things in church he talked about one time that his foot almost slipped because the people out in the world were actually prospering and he had to suffer and go through these things and then the Bible says he went to the house of the Lord the Lord showed him their end their end because if you sow to the flesh you'll reap to the flesh but if you sow to the spirit you'll reap life Everlasting and his words have life amen we all believe this word there's no doubt about it but what we're looking for is that life to come into us to breathe life into us so that we could actually have strength to go out there and tell the devil where to go amen go back from where he came man if we we've heard uh and seen people uh uh send the devil back to the pit of Hell I think that's a good place to send them the Bible says cast not a way therefore your confidence we're to have great record pencil reward for ye have need of patience that after you have done the will of God you might receive the promise for yet a little while and he shall come that will come and will not tarry now I can't say for you what is God's will for you I can't say that it's an individual affair we're all in different places God 's dealing with you about something he's not dealing with me and and if you don't feel God dealing with you you're in worse shape because God should always be dealing with us you don't want to get to the place where you don't feel the dealing of the Lord but whatever he's dealing with with you you want to keep doing his will you want to do it because that'll just lead you one step closer now I'm not saying he's not going to tell you to do something else because he may he may have you do a lot of things before the promise comes but you keep doing it don't be wary don't be relaxed about doing virtuous things about doing good things to others about pressing towards the Mark about reading your Bible about praying about listening to tapes about helping those of the household of faith I was out there I would have said Amen to that one [Laughter] but you already said that I I I say Amen again because you know the thing is it needs to become real to us we need to say Lord I'm committed to this what if this is the thing that God's asking you to do [Music] it you've got it's got to be so be it amen amen imagine what would happen if the woman with a blood issue for 12 years would have stopped after five or six years right right said you know what I'm just done dealing with this thing I've lost all my money it's not working I guess this is just my lot life and I gotta deal with it she would have never touched the Hem of Jesus Amen amen what about blind buttermaus what if he didn't say have mercy on me what if he would have just came to church sat in the back and said I can't wait to search is over I mean we got to get serious with God Amen what about the thief on the cross what if he would have said Lord remember me what if he would have attitude well I guess I just there's no chance for me I'm dying what about the Seraph Phoenician woman what if she would have got defeated when God called her a dog I'm telling you your attitude means a lot to God amen when I read about Esther and end uh and who bashti yes thank you you're in the spirit with me help me out amen when I think about those two I think about their attitude that they had towards the king that's the thing that they were both married they both went to church they both were serving the same King but what was different was their attitudes it was no longer about who was elected and who wasn't sure we could talk about that but it was God rejecting a wrong attitude in taking on the attitude that stayed humble that stayed unworthy that stayed broken and needy that was the one that God chose I believe the the wise virgins are going to be just like that that's who he's choosing the right mental attitude towards any Divine promise of God will bring it to pass if you don't relax amen if you don't just keep quoting it keep quoting it keep reading it keep believing it keep sharing it make it so real testify I can see I can see I believe I've got the right attitude the promise is coming I will not be weary yes sir I will not be weary Luke chapter 14. now this is we've read this before we of course we've read a lot of the scriptures before and I think it it's okay to keep reading them don't you Matthew 14 verse 25. it says that Ayah you're right thank you thank you I need correction Luke 14 verse 25 and there went great multitudes with him and he turned and said unto them if any man come to me and hate not his father mother wife children brother sister Jay and his own life he cannot be my disciple so as we sit here and those of us that have a family member sitting next to you you've got to make a decision who's going to be first in your life are you going to listen to someone who's leading you away from putting Christ first are are you going to take a stand for the Lord because if you don't no matter how much you go to church no matter how much you're in the message the message isn't in you like it should be you've got to put God first because Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever and whosoever does not bear his cross and come after me cannot be his disciple and I want to talk you know what your cross is right your cross is not necessarily all the hardships that you got going on in life the cross is God's will amen amen and if God tells you to do good unto all men especially the household of faith then you can't be weary in picking up your cross and carrying your cross and washing your brother and sister's feet whatever God is calling you to do for his kingdom yes amen are you with me yes sir okay now he goes on to talk about walking with the Lord here in verse 28 for which of you intend to build a tower and Sid is not down first and counteth the cost whether he has sufficient to finish it less hap live after you have laid the foundation and is not able to finish it all that behold it began to mock him saying this man began to build and was not able to finish in other words many people left and started following the Lord but through the process of time they realized that they didn't want to really continue to give up everything they stopped building and I tell you you can't be weary in well-doing God has called us to something special here special to be his bride the only group of people on the whole planet from every age to be the Bride of the creator of heavens and earth what a privilege what a calling is worth our whole life it's worth giving up everything and I'll tell you even though you gave up everything when you started give it up today give it up tomorrow give it up next week because Satan will continue to try to give you stuff to let creep into your life true we live in such a horrible hour there's no hope for the world brother Brandon said in the message birth pains he said one says I'm a Democrat the other I'm a publican the other I'm a Methodist I'm a Baptist he said why the whole thing is rotten to the Core there's got to be something give way she can't stand he says if you put a George Washington or an Abraham Lincoln in every County in this United States it still couldn't come back it's beyond Redemption so why do we want to put any time trying to redeem our nation to try to turn it around but we do have a part to play yes there are those we are we can redeem there are souls that we can affect yes we could put our time into something that's fruitless that is not going to amount to anything or we could put our time in to save one Soul which is worth ten thousand worlds now just as Abraham Lincoln was ordained to be a president you have been ordained to carry out God's will for a particular plan your job is not going to save a divided nation but your job is going to save a soul nobody can do your job nobody nobody could take your place you are involved with the people that you talk to and nobody else talks to them right so you have a foreign field to deal with you have a a a word to get to those people that nobody else in this church can get to and if you do not carry out your plan that God has for you amen I should say if you do not carry out the plan that God has for you you're not going to save that soul and I'll say the Bible says we'll give an account to God on that day now it don't matter about your plans right it only matters that you're doing the plan that God has for you so I I can have a thousand ideas of things I want to do I'm not short on ideas of what I want to do in life especially as you get older you want to do more before you die do you know none of it matters none of it matters well only thing that matters is did what did you do with what God gave you to do now we're living in perilous times but it's not the world perilous it's that inside the church there are believers who are heady high-minded Traders proud arrogant lovers of their own self we go to church this is perilous times and God is calling a bride out now remember he called the whole church out they all came out of Egypt but there were only two who said I'm going through I'll pay the price whatever others do and they had to stay in church for 45 years and deal with murmuring complaining they didn't appreciate the ministry they kept blaming the ministry for their condition maybe better off if we weren't even here at this church at least other churches are happier they got better songs come on but you know Joshua and Caleb that they had their eyes on that promise if you keep your eyes on the promise you keep this word around your neck you keep this yoke you keep obeying it not just saying it's true but you wake up in the morning and you say God if there's something in here you want me to pay attention to today let me do it when this becomes real to you I say be not weary in well-doing for in due season you shall reap if you faint not this is no hour to be fainting God has equipped us with the Holy Ghost that's why he could say be of good cheer I've overcome the world because greater is he that's in you than he that's in the world we have something on our side he's given us power he's given us strength to keep doing good we don't have to make excuses anymore when I get time when I feel better no that's not for the elect the lacks moving forward amen amen as we can tell time has slipped away let's Stand Together I never know why I just you know continue to do the notes if I never get to read them at the service you know I guess they're just for me you know they're just for me amen praise the Lord be not weary and well-doing in doing virtuous things for in the time appointed we shall reap if we don't relax I'll pray this morning that you've been encouraged to press in I wish there was an easier way knowing my heart of giving trying to help others I would certainly point it out but we've got to press through we've got to press through and spend more time with the Lord if you're feeling weary spend more time with the Lord wait on him until his presence comes and then you'll have strength to keep marching forward for the Lord amen let's bow in a word of Prayer dear father as we come before you today Lord we want to thank you for the promises that you have given to the Overcomers and Lord by your grace you've made us all Overcomers Lord the moment that you came into our heart we became an overcomer and Lord as we stand here today at the end of the service Lord your word has come forth we realize Lord that we just need more of you we need more Holy Spirit we need to stay on track and Lord we just thank you that you have given us a promise that we're really going to reap the promises that you have for us Lord if we just keep doing virtuous things keep doing good keep helping others keep pressing in father I pray that you'd bless your bride today Lord that you give each one strength in the Inner Man renew them in the Inner Man refresh them Lord may they leave here strengthened on the inside Lord Thor outward man perish Lord there's the inward man is renewed day by day may you renew them Lord may they remember lord lord your your will for them I pray that you would Lord take away any wrong attitudes Lord that we've we've had or anything that Lord that has kind of gotten in the way of just keeping our strength Lord for moving forward God we need you we need your needs you always know it Lord I pray that you would just bless each and every one of us now we humbly pray in Jesus Christ's precious name amen amen let's sing I am resolved I am resolved I'm determined I've made up my mind not playing that one oh you know we I'd rather be able to play it halfway than not play it at all I am resolved just let's do our best just play it quietly that didn't sound good hopefully the live stream got cut off before I said that I am resolved no longer to linger Charmed by the world's Delight things that are higher things that are nobler these have alert my side I will hasten to him hey son so glad and free Jesus greatest highest I will come to thee I am resolved to go to the Savior leaving my sin and strive I he is the true one he is the just one he had the words of love [Music] I will hasten to him hey son so glad and free Jesus greatest highest I will come to thee I am resolved to follow the Savior faithful and true each day do what he will if he is a living way I will hasten to him hey son so glad and free Jesus greatest highest I will come to thee I am resolved to enter the kingdom leading the path of sin friends May oppose me foes may be set me still will enter in I will hasten to him hey son so glad and free Jesus greatest highest I will come to him
