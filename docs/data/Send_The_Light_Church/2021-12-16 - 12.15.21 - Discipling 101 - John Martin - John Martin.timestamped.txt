[30:16] that can give us
[30:18] the words of eternal life
[30:20] there were many that walked
[30:22] many that heard the preaching
[30:26] lord only you can make it real to us
[30:28] amen we pray lord that you take
[30:32] full control lord of our very spirit of
[30:35] our hearts and our minds
[30:38] and lord also of any other spirit that
[30:40] would try to
[30:43] make its way into this
[30:45] uh room and the service to those that
[30:48] would be listening to try to get us to
[30:51] question or doubt the pure word of god
[30:53] pray that you'd bind up every spirit of
[30:56] doubt every spirit of unbelief
[30:59] every reasoning imagination and anything
[31:02] that would try to exalt itself against
[31:05] the very true word of god today
[31:08] lord pray that you give us
[31:10] a revelation that we may walk away here
[31:12] better equipped
[31:13] lord to carry out the
[31:16] very purpose
[31:19] that we are living today lord to spread
[31:21] your gospel
[31:23] we thank you for these things we commit
[31:25] now
[31:27] all of our needs into your hands
[31:29] lord may you come and minister to each
[31:32] and every one now in jesus precious name
[31:34] we pray amen
[31:37] amen god bless you good to see everyone
[31:39] here today
[31:41] and uh certainly good to see our
[31:43] visitors tony and i'm not sure your name
[31:46] phil
[31:47] god bless you we we welcome you here
[31:49] today and good to see our brother
[31:51] ferguson back and
[31:53] um good to see sister trina was able to
[31:56] make it mr sunday and
[31:59] just good to be together as a family
[32:02] amen turn with me if you would to the
[32:05] book of romans chapter 14 for our
[32:08] opening scripture also wanted to say
[32:10] good to have our daughter anne back from
[32:12] her trip
[32:20] romans chapter 14 we're going to start
[32:22] with verse number
[32:26] 10. the scripture says but why does thou
[32:30] judge thy brother
[32:33] or why does thou said it not thy brother
[32:39] and he gives us this warning about those
[32:41] thoughts for we shall all stand before
[32:43] the judgment seat of christ
[32:46] let's drop down to verse 16
[32:49] let
[32:50] not
[32:52] then
[32:54] your good
[32:56] be evil spoken of your good intentions
[32:58] your good words
[33:00] your good
[33:01] the evil spoken of for the kingdom of
[33:03] god is not meat and drink
[33:06] but it's righteousness and peace and joy
[33:07] in the holy ghost
[33:10] for he that is in these things serveth
[33:13] christ
[33:14] is acceptable to god and approved of men
[33:20] let us therefore follow after the things
[33:23] which make peace
[33:26] and the things were with one may edify
[33:29] another
[33:30] god bless you may be seated
[33:34] we want to
[33:37] talk about discipling
[33:40] and we just really want to talk about
[33:43] the very basics of discipling
[33:47] um i i believe
[33:49] often we get away from the very basics
[33:52] we forget about the basics
[33:55] and
[33:57] we
[33:59] try in our way to disciple now
[34:03] this doesn't matter if who we're trying
[34:05] to disciple if they know god
[34:08] don't know god
[34:10] if they're
[34:11] um
[34:13] know a little bit about the word or
[34:15] they've been in the message
[34:16] for 30 years
[34:19] these
[34:20] principles are the same
[34:24] so
[34:24] whatever you want to apply it to
[34:27] they're the same of course it may seem
[34:29] like it's harder to talk to certain
[34:31] individuals than others and try to get
[34:34] perhaps sometimes family
[34:36] uh
[34:38] to to to receive what you're you're
[34:40] you're trying to help them with
[34:42] but
[34:43] um we must be
[34:45] bold about discipling
[34:49] discipline is very important
[34:52] i think sometimes
[34:54] we can be scared or afraid
[34:57] about discipline but that what we're
[34:59] going to say is going to backfire on us
[35:01] like it did before
[35:04] right you ever you ever you ever tried
[35:06] to to to disciple somebody and and it
[35:09] just kind of blows up in your face
[35:12] all of a sudden you're being attacked
[35:16] sometimes
[35:17] uh
[35:18] we're without courage because
[35:21] the way others
[35:23] will probably respond to us
[35:25] when we go to disciple them
[35:29] sometimes we're lacking confidence in
[35:31] our ability honestly to properly
[35:34] disciple somebody that's true
[35:36] i like to entitle this message
[35:39] discipline 101
[35:43] very basics
[35:44] we're all called to disciple one another
[35:47] turn with me if you would to luke
[35:48] chapter 22 and uh verse 29 and
[35:53] and take a look at
[35:55] uh some words that jesus
[35:57] had told peter here
[35:59] i believe we can put herself in the same
[36:01] category we're all called to disciple
[36:04] one another so i don't care your age you
[36:07] are called to disciple me amen
[36:11] i don't care how much you know i'm
[36:13] called to disciple you
[36:15] it doesn't matter age nothing matters
[36:17] we're all
[36:18] the body amen
[36:20] to help one another
[36:23] and all of us
[36:26] at one time or another are trying to
[36:28] disciple somebody in the church
[36:32] and
[36:33] uh
[36:34] probably more times than not it turns
[36:36] into a flop
[36:38] right
[36:39] it didn't just turn out there's a
[36:41] misunderstanding
[36:44] taken the wrong way
[36:46] and sometimes we should be discipline
[36:48] somebody but we're too afraid
[36:51] it's not my responsibility
[36:54] and we're way off base
[36:56] way off base
[36:58] we need to wash one another's feet
[37:02] so here he says in verse 29 jesus says
[37:04] and i appoint unto you a kingdom as my
[37:08] father have appointed unto me
[37:10] that he may eat and drink
[37:12] at my table in my kingdom and sit on the
[37:15] throne judging the twelve tribes of
[37:17] israel
[37:18] and the lord said simon simon behold
[37:21] satan have desired to have you
[37:24] that he may sift you like wheat
[37:26] but i prayed for thee that thy faith
[37:28] they will not and when thou art
[37:30] converted you've got a job to do
[37:33] and that's the strength in thy brethren
[37:36] strengthen them in the word
[37:39] and peter said unto him lord i'm ready
[37:42] right now i'm ready to go with thee both
[37:44] into prison and to death i i am just so
[37:47] on fire
[37:50] and jesus said i tell you peter
[37:53] the shall not crow this day before
[37:56] thou shalt
[37:57] thrice deny that thou even knowest me
[38:04] wow
[38:07] there's a lot that can be said in these
[38:09] verses but
[38:12] we don't want
[38:13] uh to be so sure about something that we
[38:17] couldn't be wrong
[38:21] i think
[38:22] it would have been good for peter to
[38:24] have a little bit of humbleness here
[38:26] when god's trying to speak to him jesus
[38:28] was trying to speak to him here
[38:31] now there are a lot of different
[38:32] interpretations of what it means to be
[38:34] converted
[38:38] if we search the scriptures as we're
[38:39] taught to by jesus he told us to
[38:42] a person can be called of god
[38:45] he could walk with jesus
[38:47] put yourself in these shoes here
[38:50] follow his teachings
[38:52] sent out two by two to preach salvation
[38:56] receive revelation from heaven
[38:58] be used of god to cast out devils to
[39:00] heal the sick and all manner of diseases
[39:03] and still not be converted
[39:08] now that's just scripture
[39:11] because peter did all these things and
[39:13] he still wasn't converted yet
[39:19] more emphasis needs to be put on a full
[39:22] conversion
[39:24] that's right
[39:25] not just being used by god but a full
[39:28] conversion
[39:31] now the scriptures do teach us what a
[39:33] complete conversion is
[39:36] it goes way beyond these things into a
[39:39] complete nature change
[39:43] second corinthians chapter 5 verse 17
[39:46] makes it very clear therefore if any man
[39:49] be in christ
[39:50] if any man be converted
[39:53] completely converted he is a new
[39:55] creature all things are passed away
[39:57] behold all things have become new
[40:00] and all things
[40:01] are now of god
[40:03] we just don't go from one rock band to
[40:06] another rock band
[40:07] we don't go from
[40:09] worldly
[40:10] rock bands
[40:11] to christian rock bands
[40:15] all things have become of god who have
[40:17] reconciled us to to himself by jesus
[40:20] christ and given to us the ministry of
[40:22] reconciliation of course that's that's
[40:25] strengthening our brother and helping
[40:27] others to christ
[40:30] so we have to be looking beyond
[40:33] just the well i'm going to preach to
[40:35] somebody i'm going to tell somebody
[40:37] i'm gonna it goes way beyond all that
[40:40] amen
[40:41] and i'm talking about the basics
[40:45] you know brother branham taught us that
[40:47] god is hidden simplicity
[40:50] we're looking for god out here
[40:53] and he's he's he's down here
[40:57] he's
[40:58] he's much
[40:59] closer much simpler
[41:02] he's not complex
[41:07] so even though peter was called walking
[41:09] with the message of the hour and was
[41:11] elected to even judge
[41:15] at the judgment bar
[41:17] he didn't have the complete nature
[41:18] change yet
[41:20] right this is important because we all
[41:22] believe we're elected
[41:26] so it's it's
[41:28] not oh yeah i'm going to be judging at
[41:30] the judgment bar oh yeah i'm ready to
[41:32] die for you jesus
[41:34] it's where you're at right now
[41:37] it's okay if jesus gives us a revelation
[41:39] of our future
[41:41] but that doesn't mean we're at where we
[41:42] need to be right now
[41:46] it was even hard for peter to accept
[41:48] that his spirit wasn't completely ready
[41:52] he still had a little satan in him
[41:56] his spirit wasn't willing to even
[42:01] and suffer called it out and said get
[42:03] behind me satan
[42:06] that's not right
[42:07] you got to be willing to suffer for me
[42:10] his spirit wanted to call down fire from
[42:12] heaven
[42:13] and devour others
[42:16] his proud spirit rejoiced over the fact
[42:19] that spirits were subject to him
[42:22] the devils were subjective and he
[42:24] rejoiced in that and he forgot about his
[42:27] salvation it was the grace of god that
[42:29] peter was saved
[42:36] jesus said one day you shall know that i
[42:38] am in the father and you and me and i in
[42:41] you
[42:43] but that day wasn't quite there for
[42:45] peter
[42:47] and i'm afraid that day hasn't arrived
[42:49] for some of us as well
[42:53] jesus could see exactly where peter was
[42:58] and where his walk was with the father
[43:02] peter you're going to have a major
[43:04] battle with the devil he wants to sift
[43:06] you as wheat
[43:09] the devil don't like what you're doing
[43:13] and the reason he wants to sip just like
[43:15] weep
[43:16] if he can sift us like wheat before we
[43:18] have the nature change we'll never have
[43:20] it
[43:22] if he can get our mind just on doing
[43:24] this or doing that and not worry about
[43:26] the nature change see
[43:29] the nature change is the absolute most
[43:31] important thing for a christian
[43:34] and it doesn't happen be
[43:36] just because of how many days we go to
[43:38] church
[43:40] you got to get serious with how much you
[43:43] hate the old man
[43:45] amen got to get to a place where i'm
[43:48] more concerned about getting this thing
[43:50] out of the way so god can have his way
[43:51] with my life
[43:57] the holy ghost
[43:59] of god is the only thing that can bring
[44:01] about a complete nature change
[44:04] a man at his very best is all vanity
[44:09] now what the holy ghost does and what
[44:11] that nature change does is it changes
[44:14] your very motives in life
[44:18] who you're going to live for
[44:22] are you going to spend
[44:23] time building your own life
[44:27] or are you going to spend time
[44:29] strengthening others
[44:32] because that's what eternal life is it's
[44:33] actually living for others
[44:35] you're no longer talk thinking about
[44:37] strengthening yourself you
[44:39] you're or you spent that time with the
[44:41] lord you're you're on fire for god and
[44:43] now you want to strengthen others
[44:48] the holy ghost changes the way you help
[44:49] others
[44:51] the way you go about handling situations
[44:54] the way you go about discipling
[44:58] this word strengthen
[45:00] means if you look it up it means
[45:03] to turn
[45:04] resolutely in a certain direction
[45:08] so jesus tells peter you're going to
[45:10] strengthen your brethren you're going to
[45:13] turn your brethren in a certain
[45:16] direction that they're not going what
[45:18] are we doing when we're trying to help
[45:19] one another in church there's some
[45:21] problem there's some flaw there's
[45:23] something going on and we want to help
[45:25] this person we're wanting to turn them
[45:27] in a right direction that's
[45:29] strengthening our brethren
[45:32] it means to establish or set fast
[45:37] in a certain
[45:38] direction so we want to establish them
[45:41] in the right way
[45:44] to turn resolutely
[45:46] means i had to look that up
[45:49] means to turn our brethren in a
[45:52] determined or firm
[45:54] manner
[45:56] in other words
[45:58] we have to be
[46:00] brave and decisive and unwavering about
[46:03] it
[46:04] we have to be determined
[46:07] it has to be when you disciple somebody
[46:09] you can't be wishy-washy about it you
[46:12] got to be firm
[46:17] important
[46:19] but firm
[46:20] doesn't mean to be blunt
[46:23] coarse rude abrasive insulting obnoxious
[46:28] or roughing matter that's not what firm
[46:31] means
[46:34] you can be firm and determined without
[46:36] being rough and rude with your messages
[46:42] when your holy ghost is determined
[46:46] what's inside of you when it is
[46:48] determined
[46:52] you will want to see
[46:55] that person that you're talking to
[46:57] changed
[46:59] amen
[47:00] how many times i've had seven
[47:03] children
[47:04] and i don't know how many times in my
[47:06] life
[47:07] i thought
[47:09] i wish they would just stop that's
[47:10] annoying me
[47:14] i wasn't really interested at the moment
[47:17] about taking time to teach them
[47:20] i just wanted to stop
[47:22] because it's annoying
[47:24] sometimes brothers and sisters do things
[47:27] to annoy us
[47:29] we just want them to stop
[47:31] but we're missing the holy ghost to help
[47:35] we don't got because it takes time
[47:38] he that teacheth
[47:40] got to have patience
[47:43] got to have patience
[47:45] you want to help one another in here i'm
[47:47] sorry you just can't go up to him and
[47:49] say your tie's crooked knock it off
[47:52] you've got to take time
[47:57] discipline is so much
[47:59] deeper amen
[48:02] but yet it's so simple
[48:06] is corrective
[48:08] but it's not rude
[48:10] it is an abrasive
[48:12] in spirit or rough or insulting in
[48:14] behavior
[48:17] love is corrective
[48:18] but it doesn't do ill to its neighbor
[48:22] nor will it even think it
[48:25] the same love that corrects is also kind
[48:29] it's long suffering and it's able to
[48:32] bear the burden
[48:35] until our brother or sister sees it
[48:39] think about that
[48:41] you know we want to do a
[48:42] drive up to the mcdonald's window get
[48:44] our hamburger get out of there and start
[48:46] eating we want to go up to something and
[48:48] say this is it this is what you
[48:50] move on
[48:52] that's why this is called discipline 101
[48:56] because that never works
[48:58] it just causes more problems more
[49:00] divisions more isms and schisms and
[49:04] we need the true love of god
[49:10] the same love that corrects has faith to
[49:12] believe for a restored situation
[49:15] remember that
[49:17] we got to get away from this i just want
[49:19] them to stop it's wrong
[49:22] that ain't good enough
[49:24] amen
[49:26] see it through
[49:28] what if that was your spouse
[49:32] right
[49:33] you'd probably put a little bit more
[49:34] time into it
[49:38] where was your your old flesh and blood
[49:40] brother what if it was your best friend
[49:47] you can't have partiality when you're
[49:49] discipling
[49:50] amen
[49:52] jesus never said when thou art converted
[49:55] strengthen your best friends
[50:01] when thou art converted strengthen thy
[50:04] brethren
[50:07] don't try to show off like peter did
[50:10] remember he just wanted to be the
[50:12] greatest one
[50:15] don't try to convince others that you're
[50:16] willing to die for the lord or go to
[50:19] prison don't even do that
[50:21] don't try to express how
[50:23] how much you're ready right now that
[50:26] didn't get the job done for jesus i
[50:27] won't get it done for him today
[50:31] when was the last time
[50:33] you turned your cheek for someone who
[50:35] hurt you
[50:39] because obviously when somebody hits you
[50:41] automatically you know
[50:43] and they can just be hitting you with
[50:44] words
[50:46] you automatically know it's wrong
[50:52] help the person don't just tell them it
[50:54] was wrong
[50:56] they already know it was wrong
[51:00] think about this
[51:02] we need what it takes
[51:04] to strengthen one another
[51:10] when was the last time
[51:13] you went out of your way to help someone
[51:16] you dislike
[51:20] the last time you wash somebody's feet
[51:22] instead of talking about how dirty they
[51:23] are
[51:28] see we come so short of discipline
[51:33] because we got it all up here
[51:35] but we need to get it here
[51:38] right here
[51:39] this is where true discipleship comes
[51:41] from it comes from the heart
[51:44] i really don't care how much you know
[51:47] how much god can use you
[51:50] i really want to see you strengthen your
[51:53] brethren
[51:55] to turn your your brethren resolutely in
[51:59] a better position than where they're at
[52:03] and it's all of our responsibilities
[52:06] don't turn them towards you
[52:08] but turn them towards a better
[52:09] relationship with jesus christ and it
[52:11] ain't just saying this is what you're
[52:13] doing wrong this is what you should be
[52:15] doing if you do you have a better
[52:16] relationship with that's not it
[52:22] that's what peter had let's draw the
[52:23] sword let's see what we got to do
[52:25] we're going to get through this problem
[52:28] but he wasn't going to lay down his life
[52:31] and that's what it takes to truly
[52:32] disciple
[52:35] knowledge of someone's heirs
[52:38] would just puff us up
[52:41] but love will edify
[52:44] and strengthen them
[52:46] so what do you need do you need the
[52:48] knowledge of their sin the knowledge of
[52:50] their faults the knowledge of their
[52:51] heirs
[52:53] no we need the love to take care of it
[52:55] and when we just want to walk away not
[52:57] deal with it don't know what to do what
[53:00] you need to be recognizing is what's
[53:01] missing in your life
[53:04] why are we going to judge another
[53:06] someone else
[53:08] we're called to edify
[53:09] i know how to do it but get on your
[53:11] knees and get serious with god because
[53:13] after this situation you've got another
[53:15] brother you've got another sister you're
[53:17] going to be disciple until you're out of
[53:19] here
[53:23] when it comes to discipline others
[53:25] whether they know nothing about god
[53:28] or they're deeper into the message of
[53:30] the hour it still requires the same
[53:33] humble loving yet firm approach with
[53:36] your spirit
[53:42] remember it's not knowing the truth
[53:44] about somebody's heirs it's about
[53:46] helping them
[53:47] your knowledge doesn't help them
[53:53] now if i come to you and i say to you
[53:56] i've got this problem i just blow up and
[53:58] yell at my boss every day and i don't
[54:00] know what to do you got an open door
[54:06] but if i'm at a spot in my life
[54:09] that you know i yell at my boss all the
[54:11] time
[54:14] but i think i'm okay because he's wrong
[54:19] then you don't got that open door just
[54:21] to tell me
[54:23] right
[54:24] stop yelling at your boss
[54:27] now you're gonna have to disciple me
[54:31] now you're gonna get your hands dirty
[54:34] you're gonna have to come with a spirit
[54:36] that helps me
[54:38] or else i'm just going to turn you off
[54:41] i think that's why a lot of people get
[54:42] afraid of trying to disciple one another
[54:45] because they don't know how
[54:48] right i don't mean to be so frank but
[54:50] it's much more truer than what we
[54:52] realize
[54:54] what good does it do
[54:56] if you know somebody's heir but you
[54:58] don't have a plan to help him
[55:01] right
[55:03] satan knows all of our errors
[55:06] puts us in the same boat with him he
[55:07] don't got any plan to help us
[55:12] he knows our heirs
[55:18] and you know what he does with the
[55:19] knowledge of our heirs
[55:21] he condemns us
[55:23] he's the accuser of the brethren
[55:26] that's what he does with the knowledge
[55:28] of our heirs
[55:30] and what do we find ourselves doing with
[55:32] the knowledge of one another's heirs
[55:37] may not do it out loud
[55:40] we're missing l-o-v-e
[55:45] agape love we're missing
[55:47] i need to help this person because
[55:49] satan's back there he wants to get just
[55:51] two of you yell and get bitter at one
[55:53] another have things against one another
[55:55] you just stand back and go like this
[56:00] he wants to whisper in one another's ear
[56:04] but who's going to stand up and say lord
[56:06] i want to strengthen
[56:08] i want to be a peacemaker i want to help
[56:10] because it's going to take something
[56:12] greater than your reputation
[56:15] something greater than your knowledge
[56:17] it's going to take the holy ghost in
[56:19] action
[56:22] amen
[56:24] a good way to look at discipline someone
[56:27] is that you're actually restoring them
[56:31] whether they know the truth or they know
[56:33] a lot of truth whatever you're trying to
[56:35] disciple you're trying to restore them
[56:37] back to the truth
[56:41] jesus is the
[56:42] truth he's the way the truth the life
[56:45] and discipling others is restoring them
[56:48] to christ not telling them this is what
[56:50] christ wants you to do
[56:53] discipline 101
[56:56] now even though we've been given the
[56:58] word of reconciliation to restore others
[57:01] we never use the letter of the law to do
[57:04] it
[57:05] amen
[57:07] and every one of you should say amen a
[57:09] thousand times on that because
[57:11] that's what that's how we try to restore
[57:12] one another we give them the word
[57:14] word word word word
[57:18] the letter killeth
[57:20] but the spirit is what gives life
[57:23] so we don't want to give them the letter
[57:25] of the word we want to give them the
[57:26] spirit of the word the life of the word
[57:33] i watch so many people try to restore
[57:36] others to truth with just the word
[57:42] like the bible says this is what you
[57:44] should do
[57:45] or this is what you shouldn't do
[57:49] or brother branham said this brother
[57:51] brandon said not shouldn't do that
[57:54] and then they leave it
[57:56] it's like they don't have time to help
[57:59] they only got time to judge
[58:03] and that's what i say it is if only you
[58:04] got time is to give me the word but you
[58:06] ain't got time for anything else you're
[58:08] not strengthening you're not
[58:10] strengthening
[58:13] when we're converted we strengthen
[58:15] we see it through we're family
[58:23] if you don't use the spirit of the word
[58:25] it will often end up confrontational
[58:27] offensive confusing
[58:32] lord fill us with the holy ghost
[58:35] remember when jesus
[58:37] sent some of his disciples to a certain
[58:40] village as a samaritan village
[58:42] it was for a short stay
[58:45] and the village actually rejected jesus
[58:48] because he was just going to stay there
[58:51] a little bit he was passed on through to
[58:52] go to jerusalem you know all those
[58:54] samaritans didn't want anything to do
[58:55] with the jews
[58:56] so they got a little attitude toward
[58:58] them
[58:58] and the disciples wanted to judge them
[59:02] because they rejected the truth
[59:05] are you with me
[59:06] let's pick it up in luke chapter 9 verse
[59:08] 54
[59:10] and when his disciples james and john
[59:13] saw this they said lord
[59:15] will thou we command fire to come down
[59:18] from heaven and consume them even as
[59:22] it's written in the bible i've got word
[59:24] on this one
[59:27] now look at their motive this is what's
[59:29] important with this you have to look at
[59:31] their motive
[59:33] their motive
[59:35] was to destroy them
[59:37] and sometimes we want to destroy
[59:38] everything in our path that don't listen
[59:40] to us that doesn't go what we think we
[59:42] should do
[59:46] and they even used the word
[59:50] they gave word
[59:52] it's like they came to jesus and found
[59:53] them uh found this caught in adultery
[59:55] and the word says we should stone them
[59:58] well the word elijah elias did us should
[1:00:01] we just do it just just we'll do it
[1:00:04] what inspiration that inspiration was of
[1:00:06] the devil
[1:00:08] that inspiration to judge
[1:00:12] was of the devil
[1:00:15] and he says you don't know what spirit
[1:00:16] you're off
[1:00:18] you're blinded by the spirit that's on
[1:00:21] you even though you're elected
[1:00:24] even though you're in the message of the
[1:00:26] hour and you're following the prophet
[1:00:28] you're so close to jesus he hand-picked
[1:00:30] you but you still didn't have the right
[1:00:31] spirit
[1:00:33] amen
[1:00:34] wrong spirits can get us any time
[1:00:38] that's why you need to stay humble
[1:00:42] now if peter would have said
[1:00:43] lord should we should we just have a
[1:00:46] word of prayer for them before we leave
[1:00:50] i think jesus would have said that's the
[1:00:51] right spirit right
[1:00:54] you know the right spirit amen
[1:00:56] we're not getting about a disciple and
[1:00:58] convert everybody but i'll tell you what
[1:01:00] i'd rather die trying to wash somebody's
[1:01:02] feet have them pick me out of the way
[1:01:04] with their feet
[1:01:05] then not even try
[1:01:08] i don't want to be going up on the other
[1:01:10] side and the lord asked me who did you
[1:01:12] disciple
[1:01:14] discipline isn't preaching right that's
[1:01:17] right
[1:01:17] discipline isn't telling somebody the
[1:01:20] word
[1:01:22] it's taking the living word and
[1:01:24] manifested we are written epistles right
[1:01:27] of all men it's our life we're we're
[1:01:29] written with the spirit of the living
[1:01:31] god
[1:01:32] by this shall all men know
[1:01:36] when that love is manifested
[1:01:38] amen
[1:01:45] i like what jesus said here in verse 56
[1:01:48] for the son of man has not come
[1:01:51] to destroy men's life but to save them
[1:01:55] and they went to another village so
[1:01:57] after rebuking his disciples
[1:01:59] after telling them like it was
[1:02:03] he also let them know what the real
[1:02:05] motive is
[1:02:07] jesus we could say
[1:02:09] was on the converted side he wasn't
[1:02:12] converted he was
[1:02:16] the
[1:02:17] eternal life standing in front of them
[1:02:19] he didn't
[1:02:20] he did he was there where he was calling
[1:02:22] his disciples to come after they were
[1:02:25] converted amen
[1:02:27] amen
[1:02:29] and we are called to save lives
[1:02:32] to help to strengthen to better
[1:02:35] not to tell
[1:02:38] we don't need tellers
[1:02:41] we need
[1:02:43] helpers amen
[1:02:45] strengtheners
[1:02:47] to bring me closer to bring my walk
[1:02:49] closer to god
[1:02:52] i'm so glad
[1:02:53] that the lord spoke to me
[1:02:55] through a prophet
[1:03:00] when he said i'd rather have the wrong
[1:03:03] doctrine not even have the right truth
[1:03:07] but have
[1:03:08] the correct spirit
[1:03:16] think about that we all want to be so
[1:03:18] right
[1:03:20] true true true truth
[1:03:22] well you can have the truth and have a
[1:03:24] wrong spirit
[1:03:26] and eventually
[1:03:28] eventually that spirit is going to lead
[1:03:31] you away from the truth yes
[1:03:34] but you can actually be wrong the way
[1:03:37] that you see something if your spirit is
[1:03:38] righteous
[1:03:40] that spirit will lead and guide you into
[1:03:42] all truth
[1:03:44] the emphasis
[1:03:46] in
[1:03:46] discipline is the spirit that you're
[1:03:49] projecting
[1:03:50] the spirit of the word
[1:03:53] not the
[1:03:54] this we've got we're going to call down
[1:03:56] some fire right now if you don't
[1:03:57] straighten up
[1:03:59] i've had it with you
[1:04:02] you don't reject the truth
[1:04:05] they've
[1:04:06] obviously they're in this
[1:04:08] spot where they're rejecting the truth
[1:04:10] whether they know it or not
[1:04:13] there's this shouldn't be any light bulb
[1:04:15] on
[1:04:16] where we need the light bulb is how do i
[1:04:18] help them
[1:04:20] you don't know what to do spend some
[1:04:22] time with jesus
[1:04:25] lord
[1:04:27] give me the right spirit
[1:04:29] not the words to say
[1:04:32] the words to live
[1:04:34] the words to live the spirit to live
[1:04:36] amen
[1:04:37] you know we won't be able to do very
[1:04:39] good for one another if we can't
[1:04:40] disciple one another
[1:04:44] it's a body ministry we're supposed to
[1:04:46] edify one another
[1:04:52] i think too often our personal
[1:04:54] discipline we forget
[1:04:56] what the real motive is
[1:04:58] when we're trying to disciple somebody
[1:05:02] it's not about getting others to
[1:05:04] straighten up
[1:05:05] to follow us
[1:05:07] proving that others are wrong
[1:05:10] certainly not about judging others
[1:05:12] or trying to destroy their reputation or
[1:05:14] their influence
[1:05:16] we need to keep our motive peers
[1:05:19] our goal ought to be to reach
[1:05:21] and restore remember when they're
[1:05:25] in
[1:05:26] need
[1:05:28] you've got to reach them first
[1:05:32] remember brother man i'm talking about
[1:05:34] if you're trying to run somebody to
[1:05:36] christ you start out talking about what
[1:05:38] the the natural things that they like
[1:05:41] to reach them
[1:05:43] make the bridge with them
[1:05:46] well they don't like me brother john
[1:05:50] don't give me an excuse
[1:05:52] because he doesn't he won't allow you to
[1:05:54] have one excuse amen
[1:05:57] well i i'm not i'm not a deacon
[1:06:04] it doesn't matter
[1:06:06] your title
[1:06:07] it matters your relationship amen
[1:06:12] it doesn't matter your knowledge
[1:06:14] it matters
[1:06:16] are you converted enough
[1:06:18] to strengthen somebody to take them from
[1:06:21] where they're at to where they need to
[1:06:23] be
[1:06:25] this is to me to me this service puts a
[1:06:28] huge responsibility on all of us
[1:06:31] this is not some
[1:06:33] learn some scriptures and tell them
[1:06:36] no let's learn to live some scriptures
[1:06:41] all right so in disciple 101 always
[1:06:44] remember your words don't possess the
[1:06:45] power to reveal anything
[1:06:50] only god can reveal himself
[1:06:52] not us
[1:06:56] how many times you tried to speak
[1:06:57] something you gave him the word
[1:06:59] this is the word this is what the word
[1:07:01] is this is what jesus said this was the
[1:07:02] prophet said this is this is the truth
[1:07:04] and they said so what
[1:07:08] our words don't possess the power to
[1:07:10] reveal anything
[1:07:12] it has to be god's word amen and you
[1:07:15] could be speaking god's word but not his
[1:07:17] spirit
[1:07:20] you're not even given an opportunity
[1:07:23] for god to reveal amen you need the
[1:07:25] spirit behind the word
[1:07:30] when we're speaking biblical truth it
[1:07:32] doesn't mean that revelation is going
[1:07:34] into somebody's heart
[1:07:36] matthew chapter 11 verse 25
[1:07:40] at that time jesus answered and said i
[1:07:42] thank thee father lord of heaven and of
[1:07:44] earth
[1:07:45] because thou has hid these things from
[1:07:47] the wise and the prudent and has
[1:07:48] revealed them unto babes
[1:07:51] even so father for
[1:07:53] it seemed
[1:07:55] the right thing in your eyes
[1:07:57] it's good in your sight
[1:08:00] all things jesus said are delivered unto
[1:08:02] me of my father he gave them to me all
[1:08:05] powers mine
[1:08:07] and no man
[1:08:09] knows me
[1:08:10] but the father
[1:08:12] neither knoweth any man the father
[1:08:16] save the son
[1:08:18] and he
[1:08:20] to whomsoever the son will reveal him
[1:08:23] we can't figure out god you can't teach
[1:08:26] god you can't disciple anybody on your
[1:08:30] own accord
[1:08:31] you need to be converted you need the
[1:08:33] holy ghost you need the nature of god
[1:08:35] doing the discipline amen
[1:08:38] and so when you realize this just basics
[1:08:41] discipline 101 when you're going to
[1:08:44] speak to somebody the word of god and
[1:08:46] you're going to try to disciple them
[1:08:48] remember you cannot give them revelation
[1:08:52] it is impossible
[1:08:54] jesus said
[1:08:55] upon this rock i'll build my church
[1:08:58] it's what comes from heaven upon us
[1:09:02] amen so all we're doing is going there
[1:09:04] in the spirit of the word and bring the
[1:09:07] life of the word so they see the life
[1:09:10] amen that's good and that's what
[1:09:12] restores them
[1:09:14] amen it's the life of the word and you
[1:09:16] can possess that
[1:09:18] the manifestation
[1:09:20] we don't need a bunch of robots that
[1:09:22] quote the word right
[1:09:24] we're way beyond that amen
[1:09:27] we're looking for lifers amen that's
[1:09:29] right
[1:09:32] so if the father had hid the truth from
[1:09:33] the from the proud the wise and the
[1:09:35] prudent
[1:09:37] so as the son
[1:09:39] if you really want the truth it's going
[1:09:42] to require a humble and contrite spirit
[1:09:44] yes
[1:09:46] and if you want to give the truth to
[1:09:49] somebody you're going to have to have
[1:09:51] that spirit behind you if that person's
[1:09:53] got a chance
[1:10:00] people get turned off by an arrogant
[1:10:02] spirit
[1:10:03] proud know it all boastful
[1:10:06] i can prove you're wrong
[1:10:08] it's the divine love of god
[1:10:10] that's right
[1:10:11] that's gonna catch somebody it's got to
[1:10:13] be the motive the motive has to be the
[1:10:15] divine love of god to help to strengthen
[1:10:18] remember jesus talking to peter
[1:10:21] if you love me feed my sheep if you let
[1:10:22] me feed my sheep it was like that last
[1:10:24] message just kind of what he was saying
[1:10:27] in the scriptures strengthen your
[1:10:29] brother when you get converted
[1:10:33] bring people from where they're at to
[1:10:35] where god is calling them to amen well i
[1:10:37] don't know where god's calling them to
[1:10:40] then why are you judging them
[1:10:43] right seems like you have a you have
[1:10:44] enough knowledge to judge him but you
[1:10:46] don't have enough holy ghost to do
[1:10:48] anything about it
[1:10:53] all right we see our brothers and
[1:10:56] sisters there's a need there's some
[1:11:00] fault some character flaw
[1:11:02] they've been in the message a long time
[1:11:04] or they're a new believer it doesn't
[1:11:05] matter we see them in this condition
[1:11:07] what do we do brother john
[1:11:09] all right galatians chapter six verse 1.
[1:11:17] brethren if i man be overtaken in a
[1:11:20] fault
[1:11:22] ye which are spiritual
[1:11:24] restore such a one in the spirit of
[1:11:27] meekness considering thyself less thou
[1:11:30] also be
[1:11:32] tempted
[1:11:34] overtaken in a fault well
[1:11:37] if we're being honest we could
[1:11:39] we everybody's got faults
[1:11:42] everybody's got character flaws
[1:11:45] everyone's got a part of their behavior
[1:11:48] their character that just isn't
[1:11:49] christ-like
[1:11:52] so
[1:11:53] we need to help one another
[1:11:55] and we got to be spiritual about it
[1:11:58] ye which are spiritual i want to talk a
[1:12:00] little bit about this but don't look at
[1:12:02] this as an office of achievement
[1:12:06] ye which are spiritual like it's an
[1:12:07] office of achievement
[1:12:10] but it's as someone that's soberly
[1:12:12] walking in the spirit
[1:12:15] god's in control god's nature is in
[1:12:18] control
[1:12:20] most believers view themselves as being
[1:12:22] spiritual regardless of how they act or
[1:12:25] how they handle things
[1:12:29] believers are called to be seated
[1:12:31] together in heavenly places
[1:12:34] but don't be surprised
[1:12:36] if you see the enemy
[1:12:39] there
[1:12:40] because the bible says that there's
[1:12:42] spiritual wickedness in high places too
[1:12:47] god prepares a table
[1:12:49] for us in the presence of our enemies
[1:12:52] so we understand there's a
[1:12:54] spiritual battle going up so being
[1:12:57] spiritual
[1:12:59] needs to be defined correctly
[1:13:04] i'll say the core of spiritual
[1:13:06] wickedness is the knowledge of truth
[1:13:08] without the spirit of truth
[1:13:11] that to me is the core of spiritual
[1:13:14] wickedness people who know
[1:13:17] but do not have the life of this word
[1:13:20] behind it
[1:13:23] this type of spirituality spirituality
[1:13:25] has the ability to manipulate
[1:13:28] with that knowledge of truth
[1:13:32] think about all the times the devil
[1:13:33] comes and he he knows our our what we
[1:13:36] did wrong and he just goes like this he
[1:13:38] manipulates us you you no good you
[1:13:41] shouldn't have done that you're not a
[1:13:43] christian you don't you don't you yeah
[1:13:46] that's right
[1:13:47] that's what he does with the knowledge
[1:13:49] of the truth but he doesn't have the
[1:13:50] life of the word
[1:13:52] and so we too can we can be so spiritual
[1:13:56] that we have power to make
[1:13:58] someone feel condemned when they're
[1:14:00] wrong
[1:14:01] or make somebody feel justified when
[1:14:04] they're wrong oh it's okay it doesn't
[1:14:06] matter if you do that right
[1:14:08] either way
[1:14:09] you're missing the life of the word
[1:14:12] right
[1:14:13] but this spirituality is lacking the
[1:14:15] love and character of christ to help
[1:14:17] somebody
[1:14:18] because in either situation
[1:14:21] we're called to help them
[1:14:23] whether
[1:14:25] they're
[1:14:27] whether if they've done something so
[1:14:29] horrible so bad that they shouldn't have
[1:14:31] done that because you know he's been in
[1:14:33] the message for you know five years he
[1:14:35] should know better
[1:14:37] it doesn't matter
[1:14:38] it doesn't matter you do not have any
[1:14:41] right
[1:14:43] from god
[1:14:45] to condemn somebody
[1:14:47] or to say
[1:14:48] it's okay
[1:14:51] but you have been called of god to go
[1:14:53] strengthen them
[1:14:57] our goal and our motive is to restore
[1:15:00] such a one
[1:15:02] it cannot
[1:15:04] it cannot be to prove the wrong or the
[1:15:06] right
[1:15:08] and notice the scripture
[1:15:11] we don't restore them
[1:15:13] with the letter of the word
[1:15:16] the bible says restore such a one in the
[1:15:18] spirit
[1:15:20] of meekness
[1:15:22] wow
[1:15:23] we forget that we forget that little
[1:15:25] part
[1:15:26] and we're trying to straighten things up
[1:15:29] without the right spirit
[1:15:34] we give no offense to the ministry
[1:15:39] you're going with a message you're going
[1:15:40] to you're going to disciple somebody
[1:15:42] you've got a ministry
[1:15:44] minister of reconciliation
[1:15:47] you don't offend them
[1:15:49] you don't bring offense to that
[1:15:51] situation
[1:15:53] you're there with a motive to help
[1:15:55] strengthen them out of the situation
[1:16:01] we restore with the spirit
[1:16:04] of the word which is meekness
[1:16:08] jesus said learn of me
[1:16:11] i'm meek
[1:16:13] i'm meek
[1:16:15] i'm lonely
[1:16:20] when he chose
[1:16:22] moses
[1:16:24] to take
[1:16:26] the children of israel
[1:16:28] he had to first knock out all the old
[1:16:32] nature and you know it took 40 years
[1:16:35] it wasn't once or twice coming up the
[1:16:38] altar and crying
[1:16:40] no it took some real beating
[1:16:42] amen but he became the meekest man
[1:16:46] on earth the bible says
[1:16:50] you restore with the right spirit
[1:16:53] i can't emphasize this enough this is
[1:16:55] the word this is not me
[1:16:58] we don't put any thought about the right
[1:17:01] spirit when we go to somebody you know a
[1:17:03] lot of times people i've heard people
[1:17:04] have come to me they can't go to soul
[1:17:06] inside because they're afraid they're
[1:17:07] going to get upset
[1:17:09] in other words they're telling me
[1:17:12] they themselves will get upset
[1:17:14] they're telling me they don't possess
[1:17:17] enough meekness
[1:17:21] and i'm okay if you identify what the
[1:17:24] problem is
[1:17:27] it's kind of hard to help somebody if
[1:17:29] you're not helping yourself first
[1:17:32] that and it just turns into judging one
[1:17:35] another
[1:17:39] the bible says in our opening scripture
[1:17:40] for the kingdom of god is not meat and
[1:17:43] drink but righteousness and peace and
[1:17:45] joy in the holy oath
[1:17:49] not doctrines not do's and don'ts
[1:17:52] people get choked
[1:17:54] on that
[1:17:56] but the life of the word
[1:17:59] that's what will bring about
[1:18:01] obedience to the word
[1:18:05] all right
[1:18:09] why
[1:18:11] did god
[1:18:13] what did god do with the character of
[1:18:14] moses
[1:18:18] why didn't he just use somebody with a
[1:18:19] strong
[1:18:24] muscular because that's not who he is
[1:18:27] that's not who god is
[1:18:31] jesus said learn of me learn of me i'm
[1:18:34] meek and lowly
[1:18:36] learn
[1:18:38] because that's how you need to become
[1:18:40] that's right right
[1:18:42] you need to become just like jesus
[1:18:46] you still handle problems
[1:18:49] still strengthen your brethren yes you
[1:18:51] just do it his way
[1:18:53] you disciple his way amen turn with me
[1:18:56] if you would to matthew chapter seven
[1:19:00] most people
[1:19:02] when they go to disciple
[1:19:04] they don't consider themselves
[1:19:06] their eyes are so glued
[1:19:09] on how wrong the other person is
[1:19:12] they don't consider themselves
[1:19:15] true they don't they don't
[1:19:17] last thou also be
[1:19:19] tempted considering himself lest thou
[1:19:22] also be
[1:19:23] tempted what are we tempted to do
[1:19:26] judge
[1:19:28] judge that's what we're tempted to do
[1:19:31] jesus said in matthew chapter 7 verse 3
[1:19:34] and why beholdest thou the mouth that is
[1:19:36] in thy brother's eye but consider not to
[1:19:38] be missing on eye
[1:19:40] why aren't you considering your own self
[1:19:45] like who in here honestly who do you
[1:19:47] know in your life who do you know and
[1:19:49] hear
[1:19:50] and in all the most
[1:19:52] perfect people that you know
[1:19:54] tell me one person
[1:19:56] that doesn't got a problem in their life
[1:20:01] this scripture that jesus is talking
[1:20:03] about is not just for real bad people or
[1:20:06] trying to judge other people
[1:20:08] this scripture is for me it's for you
[1:20:13] we need to consider
[1:20:15] before we go to somebody and try to help
[1:20:17] them with their
[1:20:19] problem or tell them about their problem
[1:20:21] a motive needs to be to help
[1:20:23] not straighten them out
[1:20:27] and but i'll just i just want to answer
[1:20:29] that question for jesus but consider not
[1:20:31] the being that is unknown why he said
[1:20:33] why because their motive is to judge
[1:20:36] they're wrong
[1:20:38] their motive isn't to help that's what
[1:20:40] we do
[1:20:43] that's why we consider ourselves amen
[1:20:46] i'm just as much as sinners there that's
[1:20:48] right amen
[1:20:50] i need just as much help as they do
[1:20:53] so now my motive is to help them
[1:20:56] that's what i want helping me
[1:21:00] or how will thou say to thy brother let
[1:21:02] me pull out the mold
[1:21:04] out of thine eye and behold a beam is in
[1:21:08] your own eye
[1:21:11] it's because people do not consider
[1:21:13] their own character flaws
[1:21:17] they stare at other people
[1:21:20] and you do that long enough you'll judge
[1:21:22] them
[1:21:22] that's why jesus said in matthew 7 verse
[1:21:25] 2 for with what judgment you judge
[1:21:28] you're going to be judged
[1:21:30] and with what measure ye might you ye it
[1:21:32] shall be measured to you again
[1:21:36] now jesus identifies this person
[1:21:39] in verse 5
[1:21:41] as a hypocrite
[1:21:45] i don't care how religious he is i don't
[1:21:46] care how much he knows
[1:21:49] he's a hypocrite
[1:21:51] thou hypocrite first cast out the beam
[1:21:54] out of thine own eye
[1:21:55] and then thou shall see clearly
[1:21:57] to cast the mote out of thy brother's
[1:21:59] eye
[1:22:03] it takes love
[1:22:05] to help somebody
[1:22:07] it takes humility
[1:22:09] you have to humble yourself before god
[1:22:10] and say god i'm sorry
[1:22:14] now you have to go with the spirit that
[1:22:16] same spirit and help this person get to
[1:22:19] a
[1:22:21] place yes
[1:22:25] and
[1:22:26] it takes the spirit of christ the spirit
[1:22:28] of meekness
[1:22:29] the nature of god doing it see us doing
[1:22:32] it it's just going to be all vanity
[1:22:35] it's not going to amount to much we may
[1:22:37] win we may not win
[1:22:40] but the way god does it it always works
[1:22:43] amen
[1:22:45] so consider thyself
[1:22:47] don't judge
[1:22:49] consider thyself
[1:22:51] so when you feel you've been put on a
[1:22:53] mission by god to go disciple somebody
[1:22:58] take the spirit of the word and not the
[1:23:00] letter of the word only
[1:23:03] for the letter killeth
[1:23:05] but the spirit is going to give them
[1:23:06] life
[1:23:08] second corinthians chapter 3 verse 6
[1:23:10] says who also have made you and i us all
[1:23:13] of us
[1:23:14] able
[1:23:15] ministers
[1:23:16] of the new testament
[1:23:18] not of the letter now
[1:23:21] not just quoting the wrong
[1:23:23] but the spirit yes
[1:23:26] for the letter kilo but the spirit
[1:23:28] giveth life
[1:23:31] i'm so glad jesus hung and died for me
[1:23:34] it was the spirit of the word he was the
[1:23:37] word
[1:23:38] but it was that spirit of giving
[1:23:40] that we could have life
[1:23:43] and if if that same spirit lives on us
[1:23:45] we want to give life to others
[1:23:50] not
[1:23:51] tell them they're wrong
[1:23:53] but give life
[1:23:54] provide a way of escape wash their feet
[1:23:56] help them pray through get together with
[1:24:00] him do what you got to do not just
[1:24:04] say things
[1:24:07] it takes the right spirit to restore
[1:24:09] somebody
[1:24:10] the wrong spirit will do more damage
[1:24:12] than ever help somebody
[1:24:15] the wrong spirit offends people
[1:24:21] don't say
[1:24:22] don't say this i've heard this
[1:24:24] well i didn't offend him it was the word
[1:24:32] that's a wrong spirit
[1:24:38] how do you know it wasn't the way you
[1:24:39] presented the word
[1:24:42] it most likely was without the spirit of
[1:24:45] meekness
[1:24:47] all right turn with me to james chapter
[1:24:49] 3 verse 13.
[1:24:56] we can't witness properly with just with
[1:24:58] our own wisdom
[1:25:04] we need god's wisdom
[1:25:06] the bible says who is a wise man and
[1:25:09] endued with knowledge among you all
[1:25:12] right who wants to stand up
[1:25:14] because i
[1:25:17] before you stand up
[1:25:19] i'm going to call you out
[1:25:21] and you know i'll do it
[1:25:24] so who is a wise man and do with
[1:25:26] knowledge among you let him show out of
[1:25:28] a good conversation
[1:25:30] his works with what
[1:25:32] meekness
[1:25:34] of wisdom
[1:25:37] not some
[1:25:41] first timothy chapter 1
[1:25:44] meekness
[1:25:45] of wisdom
[1:25:50] this wise man isn't just using
[1:25:53] words he's using
[1:25:55] the spirit of meekness
[1:25:58] and the fruit of the spirit is
[1:26:00] love joy peace our brother jonathan in
[1:26:04] our
[1:26:05] men's meeting today he said i believe
[1:26:07] that
[1:26:08] in all of our teachings with our
[1:26:12] our children
[1:26:13] parenting spouses
[1:26:16] should always be associated with
[1:26:19] the fruits of the spirit
[1:26:23] and i believe if god's there the fruit
[1:26:24] all be there
[1:26:30] all right verse 14 but if you have
[1:26:33] bitter envying and strife in your heart
[1:26:35] against somebody don't glory
[1:26:39] don't act like you're right they're
[1:26:40] wrong you're lying against the truth
[1:26:43] this wisdom descendeth not from above
[1:26:48] it's
[1:26:49] concocted by the devil it's earthly it's
[1:26:51] central it's devilish for where there's
[1:26:53] envy and strife
[1:26:55] there's confusion
[1:26:58] and every evil
[1:27:00] work that's right
[1:27:02] how are you going
[1:27:04] to disciple somebody
[1:27:06] in an argument
[1:27:09] in a debate
[1:27:14] it's just going to create a strife an
[1:27:16] envy a confusion
[1:27:20] this this is not from above
[1:27:24] that's not this is i don't care how wise
[1:27:26] you think you are that's not a wise man
[1:27:29] let's look what we really need to
[1:27:32] witness or disciple somebody here in
[1:27:34] verse 17.
[1:27:35] just remember this is discipline 101
[1:27:37] it's not very deep
[1:27:39] but the wisdom that is from above is
[1:27:41] it's first
[1:27:43] pure
[1:27:44] the mode of is love it's pure
[1:27:47] i just want to help i just want to
[1:27:49] strengthen
[1:27:50] uh it's pure
[1:27:52] there's nothing mixed with it
[1:27:56] you can't be showing
[1:27:58] anybody that you know more
[1:28:01] that you got more
[1:28:04] that it's about you
[1:28:06] and building you
[1:28:08] it has nothing to do with you
[1:28:11] it's about strengthening your brethren
[1:28:13] amen it's a different subject than your
[1:28:16] flesh wants
[1:28:18] because
[1:28:19] when it's you doing it that's where
[1:28:21] you're going to do all this strife and
[1:28:23] envy and debate and stuff
[1:28:25] but when it's god that nature change
[1:28:27] inside of you
[1:28:29] well then
[1:28:30] it's going to be first it's going to be
[1:28:32] pure love
[1:28:33] and then look then
[1:28:36] it's peaceable
[1:28:37] there isn't any of that
[1:28:41] and it's gentle
[1:28:43] gentle easy to be entreated not harsh
[1:28:47] it's not rude
[1:28:48] and look it's full of mercy
[1:28:52] you ever get something out of the fridge
[1:28:54] some milk or something
[1:28:56] and you pick it up there's hardly
[1:28:58] nothing in there
[1:29:01] sometimes that's what some people have
[1:29:03] with mercy they just hardly have
[1:29:04] anything in there right amen
[1:29:07] amen the wisdom of god is full of mercy
[1:29:10] it feels heavy
[1:29:13] it's got what it takes to get the job
[1:29:15] done
[1:29:17] and good fruits without respect to
[1:29:19] persons without partiality and without
[1:29:22] hypocrisy and the fruit of righteousness
[1:29:25] is sown
[1:29:26] in peace of them that make
[1:29:29] peace
[1:29:31] praise the lord let's go back to
[1:29:32] galatians you got just a little bit of
[1:29:35] time with me
[1:29:37] are you getting a little bit out of this
[1:29:40] all right
[1:29:41] you getting a lot of this yeah
[1:29:44] i'm glad that the little was a little
[1:29:46] quieter
[1:29:48] all right i want to start here with
[1:29:50] galatians chapter 6 verse 1 brethren if
[1:29:52] a man be overtaking the fall ye which
[1:29:53] are spiritual restore such a one in the
[1:29:55] spirit of meekness considering myself
[1:29:57] let's not also be
[1:29:59] tempted so our true motive
[1:30:02] is love right bear one another's burden
[1:30:08] and so fulfill the law of christ
[1:30:12] see you may be
[1:30:13] on a mission
[1:30:15] to go correct somebody because it's
[1:30:16] annoying you
[1:30:19] like our kids annoy us
[1:30:22] but if you're truly discipling then
[1:30:24] you're on his mission
[1:30:28] and that mission is to bear one
[1:30:29] another's burden
[1:30:31] you bear it
[1:30:33] you bear it
[1:30:36] i sent a package down to aaron and
[1:30:39] elizabeth with all the presents
[1:30:41] and i'll tell you it was one box
[1:30:44] in this box was hard to bear
[1:30:49] because it was heavy it wasn't
[1:30:51] like this
[1:30:52] oh i can bear that
[1:30:55] it was a heavy burden so when you look
[1:30:57] at somebody they got such annoying
[1:31:00] need
[1:31:01] character fall a flaw
[1:31:04] i want you to carry it
[1:31:10] you walk around with that
[1:31:13] that's good
[1:31:15] too often i ain't carrying it you get
[1:31:16] rid of it it's annoying me
[1:31:19] and you think you're disciplining
[1:31:21] somebody amen
[1:31:24] we're having to hit the basics right
[1:31:26] it's not 101.
[1:31:29] you're still in the prerequisites
[1:31:36] the true law is not to judge with god's
[1:31:39] word but to help carry
[1:31:41] their fault to calvary
[1:31:45] because they may think it's okay to have
[1:31:46] it
[1:31:47] they may be walking around this today
[1:31:49] this is just me i'm still a christian i
[1:31:52] swear i've always been swayed my mom my
[1:31:54] dad
[1:31:56] and they carry that with them
[1:31:58] they don't even might not even know it's
[1:32:00] a it's a problem so you really got to go
[1:32:02] with meekness
[1:32:05] you just can't go bless them with the
[1:32:06] word if you're a believer the word says
[1:32:08] this you ain't doing it you ain't a
[1:32:09] christian
[1:32:12] no you have to carry that come on
[1:32:14] brother just give me some time sister i
[1:32:16] just want to show you what god's done
[1:32:19] for me
[1:32:20] amen
[1:32:22] you carry it you burden in prayer and it
[1:32:27] means
[1:32:28] it means much to you to get this off of
[1:32:31] your brother get it off
[1:32:33] as if it was on you yes amen amen
[1:32:37] and this is how you fulfill the law of
[1:32:40] christ
[1:32:41] amen
[1:32:46] too often believers think
[1:32:48] they fulfill their duty when they just
[1:32:50] tell somebody
[1:32:52] what to do
[1:32:57] but it's not true
[1:32:59] it's not at all true
[1:33:01] we got to see them through
[1:33:04] to a strengthened
[1:33:05] a
[1:33:06] a right position
[1:33:08] you've taken from the position that
[1:33:10] they're at
[1:33:11] strengthening means you take them to a
[1:33:12] right position
[1:33:14] this
[1:33:15] just discipline thing it takes a lot
[1:33:19] and i think that's why we shy away from
[1:33:21] it but i'll tell you you get converted
[1:33:24] you'll carry that burden
[1:33:26] because christ is in you and christ
[1:33:28] cares about that person even if you
[1:33:29] don't
[1:33:31] come on
[1:33:33] bear one another's burden is actually
[1:33:36] helping them
[1:33:39] this box was so heavy you don't know
[1:33:41] many times i'd have thought of where
[1:33:42] someone was here to help me
[1:33:48] you bearing is helping
[1:33:52] not telling somebody they're wrong
[1:33:56] that just getting some
[1:33:59] negative thing that's been bothering you
[1:34:00] off your chest
[1:34:04] don't report their wrongs
[1:34:06] like some
[1:34:07] newspaper or podcast
[1:34:11] is they getting the information out
[1:34:12] there let's go help them
[1:34:14] if a man think himself to be something
[1:34:17] when he is nothing he deceiveth himself
[1:34:21] verse 3
[1:34:24] a man that thinks he's something
[1:34:26] is a man who's got all the answers
[1:34:31] oh yeah that that they just need to
[1:34:35] i don't know
[1:34:36] they got a word for everything
[1:34:41] he knows so much
[1:34:44] but yet he can't do anything to help
[1:34:48] that's a person who thinks himself
[1:34:52] he's something when he's really not
[1:34:56] it ain't what you know
[1:34:58] it's what you possess
[1:35:00] silver and gold have i none but such as
[1:35:02] i have i give i in thee
[1:35:07] god is calling us to a much higher level
[1:35:12] we should never be talking about one
[1:35:14] another's problems
[1:35:16] we should be witnessing and seeing one
[1:35:17] another lay down their lives for one
[1:35:20] another
[1:35:21] that's what should be happening to a
[1:35:23] mature church that's what should be
[1:35:24] happening
[1:35:29] if we go ahead and we just think all we
[1:35:30] gotta do is tell somebody the bible says
[1:35:32] we're deceived
[1:35:35] he deceiveth himself but let every man
[1:35:38] prove his work and then shall he have
[1:35:41] rejoicing in himself alone and not
[1:35:43] another
[1:35:45] for every man shall bear his own burden
[1:35:48] so we start by learning to bear own
[1:35:50] burdens
[1:35:52] start learning to take your problems and
[1:35:55] your issues to the cross
[1:35:58] yes yes that if the power of god can
[1:36:01] help you in your life that's it then
[1:36:03] that same power yes amen can work
[1:36:06] through you to help somebody else go to
[1:36:08] calgary
[1:36:10] so you bear your burden first then you
[1:36:12] go and you bear one another's burden
[1:36:15] amen
[1:36:16] the problem is people never get to a
[1:36:18] place where they get enough nature
[1:36:20] change to where they're actually living
[1:36:22] for others
[1:36:27] some
[1:36:28] having compassion
[1:36:30] making a difference
[1:36:32] that's what it takes to bear one
[1:36:34] another's burden it takes compassion
[1:36:36] it'll make a difference let's stand
[1:36:38] together god bless you
[1:36:42] be compassionate
[1:36:45] remain humble
[1:36:51] so if i asked you a question today are
[1:36:53] you converted
[1:36:58] it's a sobering question
[1:37:00] and of course
[1:37:02] the go-to answer is yes
[1:37:06] but i just gave you the go-to answer
[1:37:10] the fruit of the answer
[1:37:13] is strengthening one another
[1:37:17] so as a pastor
[1:37:20] i'm looking to you
[1:37:23] to strengthen one another
[1:37:27] that's what a body ministry does
[1:37:30] if your
[1:37:32] ear itches
[1:37:33] you don't
[1:37:35] tell your toe
[1:37:36] to scratch it
[1:37:39] your body works together your thought oh
[1:37:42] i got to do something that's itching you
[1:37:43] your muscles start moving it starts
[1:37:45] going in that direction and you give
[1:37:47] relief
[1:37:51] the brain just doesn't do it
[1:37:54] we're a body ministry
[1:37:57] the the preaching goes forth from here
[1:37:59] yes the teaching goes forward from here
[1:38:00] but now you take the word
[1:38:03] you take the word and you start
[1:38:04] activating it
[1:38:06] and look i'd like to see you try and
[1:38:08] fail get up and try again but don't take
[1:38:10] this message today and just let it go by
[1:38:12] the side amen
[1:38:15] put it into use
[1:38:17] because as our church grows we really
[1:38:19] need the maturity of discipline properly
[1:38:22] we're going to offend people we're going
[1:38:23] to hurt people
[1:38:26] and we we need the spirit of the word
[1:38:28] amen amen let's sing
[1:38:32] i love him we don't got no music
