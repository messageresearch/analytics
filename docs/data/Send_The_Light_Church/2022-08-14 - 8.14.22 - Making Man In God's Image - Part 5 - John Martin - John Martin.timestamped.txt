[3:38] of the series and honestly this
[3:40] scripture that we're going to open up
[3:41] with in genesis chapter 22
[3:44] verse 15 is what actually started the
[3:46] whole series was this scripture
[3:49] we want to entitle this message
[3:51] possessing your gates
[3:54] possessing your gates genesis chapter 22
[3:58] verses number 15 through 7 through 18.
[4:03] then we're going to read acts chapter 2
[4:06] verses 38 39 very familiar
[4:09] and then we'll have a word of prayer
[4:11] amen
[4:13] genesis chapter 22 starting with verse
[4:16] number 15 and the angel of the lord
[4:18] called unto abraham out of heaven the
[4:20] second time
[4:21] and said
[4:23] by myself have i sworn saith the lord
[4:26] for because thou has done this thing
[4:29] because thou has done this thing
[4:32] and is not with how thy son thine only
[4:34] son
[4:35] that in blessing
[4:37] i will bless thee
[4:38] and in multiple and i will multiply thy
[4:40] seed as the stars of the heaven as the
[4:42] sands which is upon the seashore and thy
[4:45] seed shall possess the gate
[4:48] of his enemy
[4:51] and in thy seed shall all the nations of
[4:54] the earth be blessed and here it is
[4:56] again
[4:57] because thou has obeyed
[5:00] my voice
[5:01] and acts chapter 2
[5:04] verses 38 39 which
[5:07] i'm sure all of us could just quote this
[5:11] then peter said unto them repent
[5:15] and be baptized every one of you in the
[5:17] name of jesus christ for the remission
[5:19] of your sins
[5:20] and ye shall receive the gift of the
[5:22] holy ghost for the promise is unto you
[5:26] and to your children
[5:28] and to all that are far off even as many
[5:30] as the lord our god shall call
[5:33] amen
[5:34] amen amen we also just read verse 40.
[5:39] and with many other words they testify
[5:41] and exhort them saying
[5:43] save yourselves
[5:47] save yourselves
[5:48] from this entour generation so we have a
[5:50] part to play do we not amen let's just
[5:53] look to the lord in prayer
[5:54] our heavenly father
[5:56] we thank you
[5:58] lord that you have called us
[6:00] we could see yourself in the scripture
[6:02] that we have been called
[6:04] and lord
[6:06] you put something inside of us to
[6:08] respond to that call there was a deep
[6:10] call and there was a deep to respond and
[6:12] here we are today as your children we're
[6:15] growing in the grace and knowledge of
[6:16] christ and growing in love and growing
[6:19] to the statue of a perfect man and
[6:21] growing into the nature and back into
[6:23] the image lord of which you originally
[6:26] made man and we want to thank you for
[6:28] the work of the holy ghost in in each of
[6:31] our lives lord that you haven't thrown
[6:33] away the clay that over and over again
[6:36] you're molding us and making us lord we
[6:38] just want to thank you this morning for
[6:40] that lord we want to thank you that
[6:42] you've given us health and strength to
[6:43] be here in your house to to worship you
[6:46] to praise you to lift up your name and
[6:48] to come and receive lord the
[6:50] the word of life
[6:52] where you said my words are spirits and
[6:55] they are life and today lord unless you
[6:58] come and make the words that are being
[7:00] preached and the words that are being
[7:02] read and the words that are being quoted
[7:05] lord unless you come and make them live
[7:07] inside of us lord they're they're not
[7:10] going to be fruitful in our lives so we
[7:12] pray that you'd come and do what none of
[7:14] us can do here lord build your church by
[7:17] revelation inside of our hearts lord we
[7:20] commit ourself into your hands we pray
[7:23] lord through the ministry of the word
[7:24] that you would do supernatural work in
[7:26] our lives father that uh hearts
[7:30] could be amended
[7:32] lord that they could be drawn closer to
[7:34] you that bodies could be healed father
[7:38] that's that that lives could could be
[7:40] delivered lord that that man could could
[7:43] take possession of his vessel through
[7:45] the power and faith of the holy ghost
[7:47] working in them lord that you would
[7:49] truly as uh
[7:52] one had said lord that we would do
[7:55] exploits in this hour father we thank
[7:58] you for these things now we committed
[8:00] all to your hands in the precious name
[8:02] of our lord and savior jesus christ amen
[8:05] amen god bless you may be seated
[8:14] well god called abraham out
[8:17] from among his people
[8:19] and he gave him a promise
[8:22] when he was about 75 years old we all
[8:24] know the story of abraham
[8:27] and that the promise was that abraham
[8:29] was going to become a father of a great
[8:32] nation
[8:34] and every father
[8:35] needs a son
[8:38] in order to be a father and every nation
[8:40] needs a land and god had promised
[8:43] abraham the land that was needed to be
[8:45] this great nation as well
[8:47] the problem was that abraham he had
[8:50] faced uh being without child heat he
[8:54] didn't have a son and the land that god
[8:56] had promised him was already inhabited
[9:00] by his enemy
[9:03] and so that was a that was a quite of a
[9:05] problem and when we think about
[9:07] the holy ghost
[9:09] uh the promises that god had had made to
[9:12] us
[9:13] uh require help
[9:17] and it takes a strong faith right
[9:19] because abraham is the father of our
[9:21] faith and we really need faith to
[9:23] receive the nature of god in our life
[9:27] abraham might not have realized at the
[9:29] time but he was going to be
[9:32] able to to not bring these promises to
[9:35] pass on his own it was going to require
[9:38] a great trust in god and a great faith
[9:41] in god he wouldn't be able to do it on
[9:43] his own accord
[9:46] abraham went through a whole host of
[9:48] trials first he had he separated from
[9:51] his family and that was very difficult
[9:54] kind of left his home and everything
[9:56] and then he actually uh had to leave
[9:59] part of those that he was with
[10:02] he had had to separate from lot because
[10:04] i mean lot just wasn't willing to go all
[10:06] the way with god
[10:09] after 11 years
[10:12] he had a son ishmael
[10:14] he had this said because he was trying
[10:16] to bring to pass a supernatural promise
[10:22] he wanted israel ishmael
[10:24] to fulfill the promise of a great nation
[10:29] and after 25 years god finally brought
[10:32] forth isaac
[10:34] supernaturally
[10:37] and it was through faith it was without
[10:39] the effort
[10:40] the physical intellectual
[10:43] human element
[10:45] that brought this son
[10:47] it was simply i believe in you god
[10:50] you're going to do it you spoke it it
[10:52] has to happen
[10:54] and through 25 years of waiting
[10:58] god
[10:58] had an expected end for abraham praise
[11:02] god just like he does for all of us
[11:05] now it was about
[11:07] 15 or 25 years later
[11:11] that god told abraham to sacrifice his
[11:13] promised son
[11:15] and you talk about
[11:17] sometimes we feel confused
[11:19] what god wants us to do
[11:22] like something unusual is happening in
[11:24] our life
[11:26] we all are going through trials and we
[11:28] will all be going through trials till
[11:30] we're out of here
[11:33] ultimately we have to trust god no
[11:35] matter what
[11:36] no matter how foolish it seems
[11:39] trust
[11:40] god
[11:42] to abraham's obedience
[11:45] that was giving up what was the most
[11:47] important thing to him
[11:49] is where god continued to bless abraham
[11:55] any time
[11:56] that obedience stops in your life
[11:59] blessings are going to stop
[12:02] god is able to make all grace and
[12:04] blessings abound to us he's also able to
[12:07] make them stop
[12:10] and and the scripture
[12:12] tells us because thou has done this
[12:14] thing
[12:16] i'm going to bless you
[12:19] so this is
[12:20] what 40 45 years later from the very
[12:24] time that he was called out god says i'm
[12:26] gonna bless you for obeying me with this
[12:29] new commandment that i've given you
[12:32] we're not there yet saints he's still
[12:34] speaking to us the things that we need
[12:36] to be doing in our lives
[12:40] we need to continue to obey to continue
[12:44] to be blessed
[12:46] i've seen people walk away from
[12:47] obedience
[12:49] and their spiritual life just go down
[12:51] the tubes
[12:53] where once they just said they're in
[12:55] they're in they're safe everything's
[12:57] okay
[12:59] and slowly
[13:00] it just
[13:01] goes down the hill
[13:06] thing
[13:06] we can notice
[13:08] is that the natural always types to
[13:10] spiritual
[13:13] it takes a long time to receive the
[13:16] promises of god
[13:19] now
[13:21] we may
[13:23] and i'm speaking of this promise we
[13:24] could be healed just like that
[13:28] god could speak a word and it happened
[13:29] just like that
[13:31] but this nature change
[13:34] this promise that god has given us
[13:37] it types
[13:39] what abraham went through with isaac
[13:43] in receiving his promised son
[13:46] and it can take a long time in our lives
[13:48] and we don't want to be discouraged
[13:51] be not weary in well-doing for in due
[13:53] season thou shall reap if thou faint not
[13:57] and we got to keep pressing in amen
[13:59] don't give up
[14:01] god is faithful to every promise we need
[14:04] to keep believing
[14:05] amen
[14:07] now abraham begat isaac isaac begat
[14:09] jacob jacob he got joseph and this great
[14:12] nation it began to grow
[14:16] they landed in egypt
[14:18] where the children of god began to to
[14:21] multiply and and grow and and
[14:24] unfortunately they fell into bondage
[14:28] what did they do they begin to cry out
[14:30] to god call out to god
[14:33] i'll tell you that's what we need to do
[14:34] when we see the enemy creeping in
[14:36] trying to bring a bondage in our life we
[14:38] need to cry out to god amen
[14:41] don't just stay in that spot
[14:44] god brought them out with a mighty
[14:45] deliverance
[14:46] he took them through the red sea the
[14:48] wilderness
[14:50] and they
[14:51] continued to see god's faithfulness
[14:55] because god is always faithful even when
[14:57] you're murmuring and complaining god
[14:59] still remains faithful
[15:02] and here they came right up to the very
[15:04] land
[15:05] that god promised abraham
[15:09] this great land that where the nation
[15:12] was going to to be
[15:16] they spied out the promised land and
[15:18] they brought forth the evidence that it
[15:20] was a good land it was flowing with milk
[15:23] and honey
[15:24] it was exactly this was this was
[15:28] the land that god had originally
[15:30] promised abraham and to his seed
[15:34] so many years later
[15:38] they even brought forth
[15:40] fruit
[15:42] that it was a good land the grapes i i
[15:45] took a picture of brother mark yesterday
[15:48] by our little grape vineyard it's it's
[15:51] not a real big one but i'll tell you it
[15:52] had a lot of grapes on it more grapes
[15:54] than it's ever had
[15:56] big clusters
[15:59] but
[15:59] the clusters of grapes in this land were
[16:02] so great that it took two men
[16:04] holding it on a pole and bringing it
[16:07] back i mean it was so incredible that
[16:10] nobody could deny and you know how it is
[16:13] when you get in the presence of god and
[16:15] you feel the peace of god you feel the
[16:17] love of god you feel the forgiveness of
[16:19] god you know it's incredible
[16:22] amen
[16:24] but this land was filled with their
[16:26] enemies
[16:28] they were exceeding great giants
[16:31] and every gate
[16:33] of that city was inhabited with giants
[16:37] and the children of israel
[16:39] they looked like grasshoppers compared
[16:41] to these big giants
[16:44] comparably speaking
[16:46] that was their own testimony
[16:48] but they even testified that the giants
[16:50] felt the same way
[16:52] [Laughter]
[16:54] it was a mutual thing
[16:59] sometimes the devil will come in our
[17:00] life and just really try to get us down
[17:04] say you're not getting up this time
[17:07] and if we're not careful we'll agree
[17:09] with them
[17:12] this is what was happening
[17:15] even though god gave them this land the
[17:17] enemy wasn't just going to surrender it
[17:19] over to them
[17:22] because these giants weren't serving the
[17:24] lord jesus
[17:26] they were
[17:27] antichrist
[17:30] an antichrist
[17:32] spirit an anti-christ nature amen
[17:37] if they were going to take this land
[17:38] they were going to have to take it by
[17:40] force
[17:42] just like the kingdom of god it suffered
[17:44] violent and the violent have to take it
[17:47] by force
[17:51] god's promises are freely given
[17:53] you just have to go after them and you
[17:55] have to take them by force
[17:58] because it isn't like what we think is
[17:59] given it's like here it is
[18:02] it's possessed by an enemy
[18:06] and it's through faith in god that we
[18:08] inherit god's promises
[18:10] if you didn't need faith well then here
[18:12] it's just given to you like when your
[18:14] birthday comes
[18:17] you just get a gift
[18:20] you don't even have to believe you get
[18:21] it
[18:23] it's not how it is with the holy ghost
[18:25] it's not that kind of gift that's right
[18:28] now to get more faith you just need to
[18:30] feed on the word more
[18:33] the more you hear
[18:34] the word
[18:36] the greater chance that you will hear
[18:38] the voice of god because god is just
[18:40] interested in your love to him
[18:42] that's what he's looking for if you draw
[18:44] nigh to god he'll draw nigh to you if
[18:46] you just go through the motions if you
[18:48] just come to church because it's church
[18:50] if you just read because why you got to
[18:51] get my daily bread if that's all it's
[18:53] going to be you're going to come short
[18:55] of what god's really looking for
[19:00] now another thing we have to do to
[19:02] inherit
[19:03] these promises is try having a better
[19:05] attitude amen that's right the children
[19:08] of israel the majority of them did not
[19:10] have good attitudes
[19:14] they they were willing to dance in the
[19:15] spirit shout get excited and say yes
[19:18] we'll obey you
[19:20] but when it came down to the acid test
[19:25] they murmured they complained they said
[19:27] it's too hard to go to church
[19:31] brother by him said their right mental
[19:32] attitude towards any divine promise of
[19:35] god will bring it to pass
[19:36] that's how important it is to have the
[19:38] right attitude it's not good enough to
[19:40] be here in church
[19:42] it's the kind of attitude we have amen
[19:47] if your attitude is right
[19:49] you will see god leading you to be an
[19:52] overcomer
[19:53] amen
[19:55] to be an overcomer
[19:58] his main goal is not to make you a
[20:00] millionaire
[20:02] is not to take away all of your problems
[20:07] you don't see that in in the bible
[20:10] the more problems that a person has the
[20:12] more chance that god has getting glory
[20:20] the situation was that god promised his
[20:23] children a land and it was preoccupied
[20:25] by an enemy
[20:28] god was giving away land that someone
[20:30] else was living in
[20:34] now you know it wouldn't be right if i
[20:36] took brother mark's wallet took the
[20:38] money out of it
[20:39] and gave it to brother ron
[20:41] it wouldn't be right
[20:44] but
[20:45] the enemy did not create the land
[20:48] god created the land
[20:51] but the enemy wasn't going to give it up
[20:54] it was preoccupied
[20:57] the children
[21:00] of israel would not have mined god's
[21:03] promise
[21:05] if it had not been occupied
[21:09] like it was virgin territory or some
[21:13] some wilderness they probably would have
[21:15] just marched right in
[21:17] but it wasn't
[21:18] it was preoccupied by giants there were
[21:21] there were villages there were cities
[21:22] there was there was people it was it was
[21:24] an established place already
[21:28] but this was no expedition led by lewis
[21:31] and clark
[21:33] amen
[21:34] this was a battle led by joshua and
[21:36] caleb it took generals to take the land
[21:40] it took someone with a willingness to
[21:42] fight for it
[21:46] someone that had faith in god
[21:49] they needed more than just a survey to
[21:51] get in
[21:54] they had 10 spies that went out and
[21:56] surveyed the land
[21:58] but surveying it doesn't get the job
[22:00] done
[22:03] you need to over
[22:04] come
[22:05] you need to overcome the land you need
[22:08] to have that right mental attitude that
[22:11] we're more than able to take possession
[22:14] of what god's given us
[22:17] god was leading his children to battle
[22:19] but the majority of god's children were
[22:22] unwilling to fight
[22:24] think about that
[22:26] the majority of god's children did not
[22:28] want to fight for the nature change
[22:32] they didn't want to fight for what was
[22:34] promised to them if god just don't hand
[22:36] it to me on the silver platter
[22:39] i'm not going to fight for it
[22:42] i'll tell you that is a horrible spirit
[22:46] think how that makes god feel he's given
[22:49] us the greatest thing that could he
[22:51] could give us which is his life
[22:53] his nature
[22:55] the living word
[22:56] amen and we're unwilling to fight our
[23:00] old nature to get it
[23:02] how does that make him feel
[23:08] we got to fight the good fight of faith
[23:12] fact of the matter is god's promises are
[23:14] filled
[23:15] with the enemy standing in the way all
[23:18] of them
[23:21] you can listen to brother branham's
[23:22] tapes and
[23:25] and when he would
[23:27] go to uh at the end
[23:30] to to have healing lines and and and
[23:33] talk to people in the audience that you
[23:35] can receive it sitting there standing
[23:37] right there
[23:38] he says only believe
[23:41] that's the battle
[23:43] to really truly believe amen
[23:46] but to believe as the scriptures have
[23:48] taught us not the way the devil teaches
[23:51] us
[23:52] the devil teaches us he believes
[23:55] and trembles
[23:57] amen
[23:58] so we've got to believe not like he
[24:00] believes we got to believe like the
[24:02] scriptures teach us to believe a
[24:04] submissive belief
[24:05] of i'm willing to do whatever you tell
[24:07] me to do an obedient belief
[24:13] problem was that the people of god were
[24:14] not filled with enough faith to bring
[24:17] the promise to pass
[24:20] and obviously we know this displeased
[24:22] god
[24:23] he it gave him so much wrath he sworn
[24:26] his wrath that they would not enter into
[24:28] the promised land
[24:30] because they were scared
[24:34] and they chose not
[24:37] they were not willing
[24:39] to crucify their flesh
[24:43] to take possession
[24:45] of the gate of the enemy
[24:49] i want you to think about this
[24:53] our attitude towards what god tells us
[24:55] to do is very important
[25:00] we could be found displeasing him by the
[25:02] mere fact of not willing to fight
[25:05] church attendance doesn't just put us up
[25:07] on you know
[25:08] thumbs up with god
[25:11] no there's we've got to take this word
[25:13] now that that we've been given so
[25:16] faithfully since we came to christ and
[25:18] began to apply it to our lives amen
[25:21] now because of the obedience of abraham
[25:24] hundreds of years ago joshua and caleb
[25:27] knew that the land was theirs
[25:33] he said
[25:36] because thou has done this thing and not
[25:37] withheld thy son that in blessing will
[25:39] bless him multiply and i'll multiply
[25:41] this he starts in the heaven as the sand
[25:43] which is upon the sea and thy seed shall
[25:46] possess the gate
[25:48] of his enemies
[25:51] oh
[25:53] abraham this was ching ching ching ching
[25:56] for a for uh joshua and caleb i mean
[26:00] they were the seed
[26:03] of abraham amen
[26:06] all because their father abraham obeyed
[26:11] the children the grandchildren the great
[26:13] grandchildren get blessed
[26:15] think about how important it is to start
[26:18] the cycle right now
[26:20] let the past be passed and start right
[26:23] now the cycle
[26:25] that's right amen
[26:27] it's possessing time for the children of
[26:29] god
[26:30] amen
[26:31] now there's a natural seed of abraham
[26:33] and there's a spiritual seed of abraham
[26:36] we are the spiritual seed of abraham
[26:39] and we have the same promise of
[26:42] possessing the gate of our enemy
[26:45] the same promise
[26:47] now we know that our enemy isn't our
[26:51] brother our sister our neighbors our
[26:54] boss our pastor
[26:59] we are we are our greatest enemy
[27:03] and and it's not
[27:06] our intentions
[27:08] it's it's it's not um
[27:11] it's not our personality
[27:14] it's not how we look
[27:19] it's that evil nature
[27:22] that hasn't been
[27:26] that's still in possession of our lives
[27:30] that's our enemy
[27:33] and you know the majority of most
[27:34] christians don't want to deal with it
[27:40] when we would try to go do good evil is
[27:43] right there
[27:45] keeping us from doing it
[27:48] and when we would do our very best not
[27:50] to do evil there's that old nature there
[27:53] that's enticing is to go ahead and do it
[27:55] anyways
[27:57] and this
[27:59] our
[28:00] this is the enemy that we got to kick
[28:02] out
[28:05] what we need
[28:07] is to get control of our gates
[28:10] to take possession
[28:13] of the pathways
[28:15] that enter in
[28:18] and that's not a gift
[28:20] you gotta learn to swing your sword
[28:24] you gotta learn to get on your knees and
[28:26] get
[28:27] your instructions from
[28:29] general jesus
[28:33] i'm going to say some things and i just
[28:34] want you to bear with me
[28:37] the promised land
[28:38] is not the holy ghost
[28:42] as you would think
[28:46] the holy ghost is a promise to every
[28:49] believer acts 2 38
[28:52] and 239
[28:55] but remember the holy ghost
[28:57] will fall upon the just and the unjust
[29:04] but jesus told us to be perfect
[29:06] with god's nature
[29:08] that's what he said
[29:10] when he said be perfect
[29:12] even as my father in heaven is perfect
[29:14] that we love our enemy
[29:16] that we have the same nature that he has
[29:19] that we go back to the same image
[29:24] now you just bear with me i'm not off
[29:27] on some limb
[29:29] but i'm trying
[29:31] to help us
[29:33] see a bigger picture
[29:36] the spiritual promised land is not the
[29:38] holy ghost and it's not your body
[29:41] the holy ghost could anoint you touch
[29:43] you bless you and yet never have
[29:46] possession of you
[29:51] the holy ghost can justify you it can
[29:53] sanctify you and even use you and never
[29:56] yet have possession of you
[30:01] even though these are the works of the
[30:03] holy ghost it is not our promised land
[30:10] your spiritual promised land is when the
[30:12] holy ghost has possession
[30:14] of your life preeminence and possession
[30:17] of your life
[30:22] hey look 12 spies went into that
[30:24] promised land
[30:25] 10 of them came out with fruits of the
[30:27] holy ghost
[30:31] scared as all get out
[30:38] two of them said that land's ours
[30:42] but they didn't possess it yet
[30:44] they could say god said it moses said it
[30:46] abraham said it it right down the line
[30:49] it's written in the word it's ours
[30:52] but you got to take it
[30:53] amen
[30:55] the holy ghost has got to take over in
[30:58] our lives that is the promised land
[31:02] it isn't just anointing us
[31:06] it isn't dance in the spirit speaking in
[31:08] tongues and being used and then not used
[31:11] it's a possession
[31:13] it's a seal until the day of your
[31:15] redemption
[31:21] what does god want he wants our hearts
[31:24] it's you and god living together
[31:30] it's when you have been set free from a
[31:32] selfish nature that you were born with
[31:35] that's no longer
[31:37] giant standing in your way how many has
[31:40] ever been delivered before
[31:43] okay so there is something in your life
[31:45] that you know was not holy
[31:49] and god delivered you
[31:51] wasn't that the most one of the most
[31:53] amazing
[31:54] experiences you had
[31:56] because before that time you tried to
[32:00] get rid of it
[32:01] you wished so many times it wasn't there
[32:04] you were condemned so many times because
[32:07] when you did it you knew it wasn't right
[32:09] and when god came and set you free of
[32:12] that
[32:13] well that was nothing but god himself
[32:15] amen
[32:19] now imagine
[32:21] every part of your life like that
[32:26] that's what we should be pressing
[32:27] towards
[32:29] that's what paul meant when he said i
[32:31] pressed towards the mark for the prize
[32:33] of the high calling
[32:35] not being satisfied always satisfied
[32:38] with just this and this and this god is
[32:40] looking for somebody's who's hungry for
[32:42] this and this and this and this
[32:46] because is that who he wants to spend
[32:48] eternity with
[32:58] i don't want giants staying in my way
[33:00] it's a process
[33:02] of sanctification and obedience in your
[33:04] life
[33:07] god takes preeminence of your faith
[33:13] through faith you inherit the promises
[33:16] well faith comes from god
[33:20] from hearing god
[33:21] it isn't we can't manufacture we can't
[33:24] you can't look at if you don't got no
[33:26] money in your account
[33:28] at the bank you can't go there and get
[33:29] money out
[33:31] there's no money to get out
[33:34] you got
[33:35] that's why they make debit cards now
[33:37] because too many people maxed their
[33:39] credit cards out
[33:48] god wants us to take possession
[33:50] of the gates of all these gates in her
[33:53] life
[33:54] sometimes we just let our our memory run
[33:57] random
[33:59] our affection just go over here our
[34:02] imagination
[34:04] we just let things happen in here and we
[34:08] think everything is still okay with us
[34:10] in god
[34:14] god wants to control that amen
[34:17] but he can't do it because it's through
[34:19] free more agency
[34:23] you have to say god i want a greater
[34:24] spirit in my heart right now because
[34:26] what's going on ain't right
[34:29] you can't just say well whatever
[34:30] whatever i don't i'm too busy right now
[34:34] it's got to mean more to you
[34:40] peter said repent and be baptized every
[34:43] one of you in the name of jesus christ
[34:45] for the remission of your sins and you
[34:47] shall receive
[34:49] the gift of the holy ghost
[34:51] that
[34:53] word gift it means a
[34:55] um
[34:56] like a gratuity
[34:59] in other words
[35:03] god didn't have to give it to you
[35:07] it was by his
[35:09] free will his choice to give it to you
[35:12] and the bible says you shall receive
[35:14] this gift now that word receive isn't
[35:17] what we think it means
[35:19] it means to take
[35:23] it means to get a hold it means to seize
[35:26] and it means to attain
[35:31] you got to get a hold of it
[35:34] you're not going to drop it on you like
[35:36] a parachute
[35:39] our hearts have to get in a certain
[35:40] condition
[35:42] our hunger and our thirst after
[35:44] righteousness has to get in a certain
[35:46] condition we've got to seek him not just
[35:49] a little bit but with all of our hearts
[35:51] we've got to mean business this is this
[35:53] is the there is nothing greater than the
[35:55] life of god and we're going to try to
[35:57] attain it through a half-hearted heart
[36:11] not going to happen
[36:17] the promised land was not just the holy
[36:18] ghost but it's the holy ghost nature
[36:21] living inside of you
[36:24] so often we can be anointed with the
[36:26] holy ghost and say i got the holy ghost
[36:33] how often does anybody look at their
[36:35] life through the course of the day
[36:37] and say
[36:39] oh joy peace i just see it bubbling out
[36:41] all over me here's the nature
[36:43] here's the nature of god
[36:45] coming out
[36:47] that's what we should be seeing not some
[36:49] experience we had
[36:51] are you with me
[36:55] it is a gift given to us just like god
[36:57] gave the promised land to the children
[36:59] of israel but they needed to go possess
[37:01] it and so do we
[37:04] they needed faith to possess it we need
[37:06] faith to possess this giant monstrous
[37:10] devilish selfish nature
[37:17] first corinthians 5 verse 17 therefore
[37:20] if any man be in christ he's a new
[37:21] creature old things are passed away
[37:23] behold all things have become new
[37:26] all right there's the promised land he's
[37:28] a new creature
[37:30] and all things are of god
[37:32] there's something that's taken place and
[37:34] do you see that
[37:36] god wants us to get on to get up and
[37:39] let's get going
[37:41] and stay there
[37:42] not up and down
[37:45] not his church and i gotta try a little
[37:46] bit harder
[37:49] but get serious about getting the nature
[37:51] change
[37:55] brother john my nature has been changed
[37:56] god took this away and he took that away
[37:59] okay
[38:00] but what about the other
[38:03] what about getting to the place where
[38:05] you can love everyone
[38:08] what about getting to the place where
[38:09] you're living for others you're laying
[38:11] down your life and that you're making
[38:13] time for god amen what about acting like
[38:16] god is really in us and he's possessing
[38:19] us and it's not you
[38:23] sometimes the way we talk the things we
[38:26] say the way we disrespect one another it
[38:29] shows that god's not in possession it
[38:31] doesn't matter what you say
[38:37] we there's enough in our life we should
[38:39] all be hungering and thirsty for more of
[38:41] god
[38:45] a amen creature means there's nothing
[38:47] left of the old creature
[38:50] now i understand
[38:52] we're not going to be perfect jesus
[38:54] christ walking that is not my message
[38:57] today
[38:58] my message today and always has been is
[39:02] that we should be pressing towards that
[39:06] because it's it's your attitude towards
[39:08] what god wants you to become that'll
[39:10] actually get you there
[39:14] but if you keep
[39:15] satisfying yourself with nobody can get
[39:18] there and nobody's perfect and you know
[39:20] i'm better than i was and you know what
[39:23] you're just missing the attitude
[39:26] that our paul had
[39:30] he never acted like he attained
[39:34] never acted like he
[39:35] uh possessed
[39:38] but he was always pressing towards
[39:42] we all should have that that's an easy
[39:44] thing to have
[39:45] it would be hard to just say well we all
[39:47] need to be perfect
[39:49] you know what i mean we just actually be
[39:51] miserable
[39:52] but you can be so imperfect but yet have
[39:54] an attitude of unpressing
[39:56] amen amen that's where you'll see god
[39:59] it's the humble
[40:02] he dwells with the humble
[40:04] with the broken with the contrite
[40:07] he's going to see them through
[40:10] you know the pharisees
[40:12] sadducees they were so i got it together
[40:16] their whole mission was you know to let
[40:18] others know how much they got
[40:21] they were never about pressing in
[40:24] they were all about judging others
[40:27] come on
[40:30] they thought they had the land because
[40:31] you know what the devil told them you
[40:33] got the land
[40:35] you got the land
[40:37] they didn't have the land
[40:43] when we're born again every believer
[40:46] is in a place
[40:48] that he's flown with milk and honey
[40:51] springs of living water
[40:53] it's the nature of god coming out but
[40:56] you can't give out what's not there
[41:00] and
[41:03] we're baptized one time by the holy
[41:05] ghost
[41:06] into the body one time
[41:09] one time
[41:12] but we need to be filled and refilled
[41:14] and filled and refilled because it has a
[41:17] way of just kind of leaking out or
[41:19] becoming a a dormant vessel
[41:23] and if if the devil can get you so busy
[41:26] so distracted that you won't got time to
[41:28] get more of the nature of god
[41:31] he's achieved his
[41:32] goal he's achieved his goal
[41:37] we need to have fruit of the land in our
[41:39] lives
[41:41] the fruit
[41:43] we don't want to be someone that's in
[41:45] and out of the land right that's true
[41:48] but take possession of the land now
[41:50] remember there were 12 spies
[41:53] 10 went in and out of the land
[41:56] yes i got it yes i believe yeah no i
[41:58] don't yes i'm having a heart yet
[42:03] if all you got is yeah i've had this
[42:06] experience with god
[42:11] god wants us to stay in the land
[42:14] to stay right there were you what you
[42:17] had
[42:21] because god has more for us
[42:26] if we're in and out of god's promises
[42:28] we're no more than the ten spies
[42:31] i know that's a strong statement
[42:34] but they went in they experienced it
[42:36] they came back with a good report
[42:39] with part of the word
[42:44] god god is true i felt these blessings
[42:46] in my god this is what
[42:49] but then
[42:50] they didn't feel they were able
[42:53] to really take possession of their whole
[42:56] bad nature
[42:57] because it was pretty bad
[42:59] they didn't want to face it
[43:03] if that's where we're going to be in our
[43:04] lives we're no better than the 10 spies
[43:07] but i wonder if we got any joshua and
[43:09] caleb's in here
[43:12] praise god
[43:16] now no matter how many joshua and caleb
[43:17] they're in here
[43:18] they couldn't change the attitude of the
[43:20] others
[43:22] so i want to tell you something here
[43:25] make sure you're not depending on
[43:26] somebody else to change your attitude
[43:31] take possession of your vessel through
[43:34] your attitude
[43:38] i always used to quote this all the time
[43:40] this
[43:41] quote by
[43:43] james that's all i know cameron
[43:45] huh
[43:47] ellen
[43:48] james allen he says the greatest
[43:50] discovery of any generation is that a
[43:52] man can alter
[43:54] his
[43:55] life by altering his attitude amen
[43:59] and you can alter your nature
[44:02] by just changing your attitude
[44:05] going from
[44:07] i don't know if i could do this i'm
[44:08] scared because i got all these things in
[44:10] my life i'm just going to make a bunch
[44:11] of excuses and say you can't do it
[44:15] just change that
[44:16] so i can do all things through christ
[44:20] just alter it
[44:22] alter the attitude
[44:24] because your attitude means everything
[44:27] it's free more agency that's really what
[44:29] it is
[44:36] galatians 5 22 this is the promised land
[44:39] but the fruit of the spirit is love joy
[44:42] peace long-suffering gentleness goodness
[44:44] faith meekness temperance against such
[44:47] there is no law now that is
[44:50] the promise that is the holy ghost
[44:55] and it never changes
[44:57] it never changes
[44:59] and if that's living in you
[45:02] then you
[45:03] and god
[45:04] are one
[45:06] now i'm talking about abiding
[45:09] i'm not talking in and out
[45:13] god wants us
[45:16] to be living epistles
[45:18] right of all men
[45:20] not just certain people that we're going
[45:22] to connect with here and there
[45:25] amen
[45:26] all the time especially let me just say
[45:29] this
[45:30] especially when you're going through the
[45:32] darkest trial of your life
[45:35] because if people can see jesus in your
[45:37] life then
[45:39] oh they're seeing a god that's alive
[45:41] a god with power a god with might a god
[45:44] with strength
[45:48] and look at this
[45:50] i love verse 24. and they that are
[45:53] christ
[45:54] have crucified the flesh
[45:57] with the
[45:58] affections and
[46:00] lust
[46:02] they've taken possession of the gates
[46:06] possession
[46:08] you can't have the
[46:10] flow of god's holy spirit you can't be
[46:12] abiding in the land and not crucify your
[46:15] flesh
[46:17] you can walk into a meeting you can walk
[46:19] into the presence of god you can be
[46:21] blessed you can be anointed but it will
[46:24] never possess you if you don't take
[46:26] possession of your gates
[46:31] that's why we can be blessed on cloud
[46:33] nine for a week or two
[46:36] and then afterwards we're wondering what
[46:38] happened
[46:40] god is good
[46:42] he's good
[46:44] amen
[46:47] what we have to do is be willing to love
[46:50] him enough
[46:51] to crucify your flesh so he so we can
[46:53] stay in the land
[46:57] all right if we live in the spirit let
[46:59] us walk in the spirit
[47:01] let us not be desirous of vain glory how
[47:04] many has ever just really wanted to
[47:06] tension
[47:08] i mean he's not even being honest with
[47:09] me right now
[47:10] i mean he's lying right in church
[47:16] desirous of vainglory
[47:18] let's give the glory to jesus
[47:21] provoking one another you ever just want
[47:24] to dig at somebody because you just had
[47:27] something against them
[47:29] something you didn't like
[47:32] just kind of provoke them
[47:35] let us not be desirous of anger
[47:37] provoking one another and being one
[47:39] another
[47:41] and they that really belong to christ
[47:44] they have crucified
[47:47] the flesh
[47:51] they've taken possession that's how you
[47:52] take possession of the gates
[47:56] it's not when i say hey we need to do
[47:57] something about this situation i'm not
[47:59] saying hey we're being bad
[48:02] what i'm saying is
[48:03] the devil's
[48:04] bad
[48:06] we got to get control of that situation
[48:09] if we don't crucify the flesh we'll
[48:11] never ever possess the gate of the enemy
[48:15] john 14 20.
[48:18] at that day jesus speaking here we're
[48:20] talking about the promised land that
[48:21] that day you shall know that i am in the
[48:23] father and you and me and i in you now
[48:26] see this is the promised land
[48:29] it's when god has taken possession
[48:35] he that have my commandments and keepeth
[48:37] them no this is how we get into it he
[48:39] that loveth me
[48:42] he it is that loveth me and he that
[48:44] loveth me shall be loved of my father
[48:46] and i will love him and will manifest
[48:48] myself to him
[48:52] verse 23
[48:54] jesus answered
[48:56] and said unto him if a man loves me
[49:00] he will keep my words
[49:02] and my father will love him and we will
[49:05] come unto him and make our
[49:09] what word is that
[49:10] our what
[49:12] a bolt
[49:14] not a visit
[49:16] you not just come and visit for a little
[49:18] bit
[49:19] not just to have a special
[49:22] anointing some service
[49:24] no an abode
[49:26] god wants to take a boat his interest is
[49:29] not just blessing you today his interest
[49:32] is blessing you every day
[49:35] john 17 20.
[49:40] neither pray i for these alone
[49:44] but for them also what shall believe on
[49:45] me through
[49:46] through their word
[49:48] that's us
[49:49] jesus is praying for us
[49:52] jesus prayed for us
[49:53] in this prayer
[49:56] that they all may be one as thou father
[49:59] art in me and i in thee
[50:01] that they also may be one in us that the
[50:04] world may believe that thou has sent
[50:07] me
[50:08] and the glory which thou gavest me i've
[50:10] given them that they may be one even as
[50:12] we are one i in them and thou in me and
[50:15] they that they may be made perfect in
[50:18] one and that the world may know that
[50:20] thou has sent me and has loved them as i
[50:23] as thou has loved me now this is the
[50:25] promised land
[50:27] this is a complete nature change when
[50:30] you become one with god god does not
[50:33] take on your nature
[50:36] not at all it abhors him we take on
[50:40] god's nature
[50:42] god is bringing us back to the same
[50:45] image
[50:47] it's a oneness with god it's when the
[50:49] holy ghost comes in
[50:51] now you've got to be saying i want it i
[50:54] want it i'm taking it i don't care about
[50:56] this this thing in my life that's is
[50:58] standing in my way i'm overcoming it
[51:02] it's an attitude
[51:08] it's abiding
[51:10] not visiting
[51:13] the abiding of the holy ghost in our
[51:14] life this is the spiritual promised land
[51:17] anybody can point and say yeah god did
[51:19] this i did this this happened i was
[51:20] slain in the spirit i was thrown over
[51:22] here i danced over here this happened to
[51:24] me god used my body i prophesied all
[51:27] those things are true
[51:29] but there's no possession
[51:31] and people get satisfied and say that's
[51:33] the evidence that's the evidence spoken
[51:35] tongues that's the evidence that is not
[51:37] the evidence
[51:41] the evidence is taking every word of god
[51:44] in your life that's the evidence
[51:46] god ain't gonna leave one part out man
[51:49] shall not live by barlow but by every
[51:51] word that proceedeth out of the mouth of
[51:52] god
[51:56] now just
[51:57] a little simple
[51:58] i believe god's hidden simplicity
[52:01] the first thing our motive must be love
[52:05] you're going after this promised land
[52:07] your motive has to be love
[52:10] that's what jesus said
[52:12] if you got to you've got to love god and
[52:15] if you love god you will keep his
[52:17] commandments
[52:19] that's kind of love
[52:22] right because brother brown says you can
[52:23] love god every day with just
[52:25] out here and never get in here
[52:29] never have your free more agency to go
[52:31] to obey every word of god
[52:35] love is the key
[52:37] now one of the prophets said whatever
[52:38] you do get perfect love
[52:42] second
[52:43] our goal must be to obey every word of
[52:45] god
[52:46] now tell you
[52:48] when you love god his words are not
[52:50] grievous
[52:53] but when that love is missing it can be
[52:55] struggling to do the will of the lord
[53:00] we need to get serious with obeying
[53:02] god's word
[53:04] every word of god matters to god it
[53:06] needs to matter to us
[53:08] it's part of the process
[53:11] third god will take his abode if we do
[53:14] that
[53:15] he promised
[53:16] so set your love on him set your
[53:18] affection on him move towards god and
[53:20] then in the simplest little things that
[53:22] god has spoken to you may think it's not
[53:24] a big thing to god but just start
[53:25] obeying it
[53:29] this is part of the process
[53:32] that word abode it means residence it
[53:34] means dwelling
[53:36] we may visit a lot of places in life but
[53:38] most of us just have one dwelling
[53:41] can't serve two masters and god is not
[53:44] going to share
[53:46] your vessel with the giant
[53:48] ugly nature
[53:52] he's not going to do it
[53:55] you don't want to be around someone
[53:56] who's selfish
[53:58] self-centered
[53:59] arrogant
[54:00] wild uncontrollable
[54:05] that's our enemy
[54:06] and we need to take possession of that
[54:09] god is able to raise up stones onto
[54:12] abraham
[54:15] he is
[54:18] that doesn't mean he's going to do it
[54:21] he's looking for you the children of
[54:24] abraham
[54:25] to take the promise of god
[54:27] take possession of what he's already
[54:29] promised you
[54:37] i don't think we can get more too
[54:39] serious with god
[54:44] our faith can't just be in the blood of
[54:46] jesus christ to cover our sins
[54:51] they can't
[54:52] our faith must also be in the blood of
[54:55] jesus christ to give us power to
[54:57] overcome our ungodly nature
[55:02] the problem is we take part of god we
[55:04] want part of god but we don't have faith
[55:07] in the giants that are in our life
[55:12] the bleeding word is what changes us
[55:14] from glory on to glory
[55:17] we must open our freebore agency to all
[55:20] of god's word in order to for all of us
[55:23] to be changed
[55:24] second corinthians 3 17
[55:27] now the lord is that spirit
[55:30] and where the spirit of the lord is
[55:32] there is liberty
[55:34] the lord only goes where there's liberty
[55:39] he's not going to come into our hearts
[55:41] if you know we just want to go do our
[55:43] own thing
[55:45] he's going to come where he's welcome
[55:48] why
[55:49] now he can fill anybody
[55:52] right but he
[55:54] he said i'm only gonna i'm gonna fill
[55:56] those that hunger and thirst after me
[56:01] but we all with open faces beholding us
[56:04] in the glass the glory of the lord
[56:07] that's when we come to church
[56:09] and we see ourselves in the word
[56:12] are changed
[56:13] into the same image
[56:16] from glory to glory
[56:18] even as by the spirit of the lord so we
[56:21] might as well kick out of the door i
[56:22] repented i got baptized them in the body
[56:26] well that's great now let's talk about
[56:27] the change
[56:29] the change from glory to glory into the
[56:32] same image by the way
[56:34] not the same knowledge
[56:36] remember that tree of knowledge has the
[56:38] knowledge
[56:40] of the word knows the mysteries
[56:44] how's that
[56:46] but i want to be changed
[56:49] the living word of god is what changes
[56:51] us
[56:52] and you know the difference between
[56:56] this word
[57:01] and the living word
[57:06] this word
[57:08] the bible says
[57:10] kills us
[57:14] the living word
[57:16] is what brings life to us
[57:19] that's why for us to be satisfied with
[57:21] just hearing what's being preached
[57:23] naturally
[57:24] is only going to destroy us and bring
[57:26] condemnation down the road
[57:29] there's got to be something that lies
[57:31] within us that is hungering for what's
[57:33] being spoken behind the pulpit
[57:36] to be hungering for inside of our hearts
[57:38] and our lives
[57:39] something that an attitude that we got
[57:41] to have that lord i'm going to take this
[57:43] word i'm not just going to just belittle
[57:46] it by not paying attention to it but i'm
[57:48] going to take it home i'm going to
[57:49] embrace it i'm going to love it i'm
[57:51] going to be going to believe it means so
[57:53] much to you lord
[57:57] that's what brings about change
[58:04] he came to his own and his own received
[58:06] him not but as many as received him to
[58:09] them gave him power to become the sons
[58:12] of god even to them that believe on his
[58:14] name
[58:15] now it's easy
[58:17] to receive him
[58:19] it's hard
[58:21] to receive his commandments
[58:25] i can receive what christ did for me at
[58:27] calvary
[58:28] but to receive that i got to obey the
[58:30] word
[58:32] that's hard
[58:35] that's why jesus said if you love me
[58:36] you've got to keep those commandments
[58:39] it shows the reciprocating of love
[58:42] the interest that we have
[58:45] about following this word
[58:47] in areas that we're not following
[58:51] means everything to god
[58:53] in the relationship
[58:55] he's interested
[58:57] okay you've been changed
[58:59] have you not
[59:00] we all can say we've been changed here
[59:05] but
[59:06] we just read in the scripture where the
[59:08] spirit of the lord is he has something
[59:09] on his mind
[59:11] that he wants to change us
[59:13] more
[59:16] from glory unto glory amen
[59:18] building up to the statue of a perfect
[59:21] man more into his image
[59:24] it it i wish it could happen just
[59:26] through the osmosis of hearing the word
[59:28] of god we just put all headphones on and
[59:30] stay in our homes and hear
[59:33] but it's not like that
[59:36] there's a realness
[59:39] that takes place
[59:43] which were born not
[59:45] of blood nor the will of the flesh nor
[59:47] of the will man but of
[59:49] god
[59:51] don't try to receive christ without
[59:53] receiving his will
[59:56] do not try to receive christ without
[59:59] receiving his will if you do you will be
[1:00:01] viewed by jesus christ as a thief and a
[1:00:03] robber
[1:00:06] all that ever came before me are thieves
[1:00:08] and robbers they want eternal life but
[1:00:10] they're not interested in the will of
[1:00:12] god
[1:00:15] i know this is some strong stuff but
[1:00:17] look when you're not here you got demons
[1:00:20] telling you to lay back
[1:00:22] don't worry somehow you're just going to
[1:00:24] be changed in the twinkling of an eye
[1:00:26] worry about it then
[1:00:28] no
[1:00:30] death doesn't change as brother branham
[1:00:32] said it doesn't change the condition of
[1:00:33] the soul it's changed here
[1:00:35] we're the ones that got to get
[1:00:36] interested in changing it
[1:00:39] praise the
[1:00:40] lord now most of us don't want to talk
[1:00:43] about the giants in our life
[1:00:46] nor do we want to deal with them
[1:00:49] we don't want to talk about anger issues
[1:00:52] arrogant issues
[1:00:54] uncontrollable issues
[1:00:56] selfish issues
[1:00:58] unthankful issues
[1:01:00] disobedient issues unfaithful issues
[1:01:04] we don't want to talk about vices or
[1:01:06] habits in our life
[1:01:08] most of the time we want to hear
[1:01:10] anything
[1:01:11] but
[1:01:12] taking possession of those things
[1:01:18] that's why we can all rally behind
[1:01:21] some mystery
[1:01:24] something about what god has
[1:01:26] done for us
[1:01:30] and i'm i'm happy with that but we need
[1:01:32] to get serious about taking the land
[1:01:35] look those 10 giants
[1:01:37] they all they were they were so deceived
[1:01:40] those children of israel
[1:01:42] they were deceived because they believed
[1:01:44] not
[1:01:45] and he said he would turn those over
[1:01:48] who would believe not he has blinded the
[1:01:50] eyes of the world that believe now we've
[1:01:52] got to believe in this nature change
[1:01:55] we've got to
[1:01:57] they were so deceived they they thought
[1:01:59] they could serve god outside of the
[1:02:01] promised land
[1:02:05] i don't really i can serve god without
[1:02:07] nature change that's what they were
[1:02:08] saying
[1:02:11] look if that's foolish virgin
[1:02:13] amen
[1:02:14] that's not wise
[1:02:16] we got to go on and get the nature
[1:02:18] change stay away from saying i got the
[1:02:21] holy ghost
[1:02:23] why would you say that
[1:02:26] i don't understand why you would say it
[1:02:28] who are you trying to convince
[1:02:31] how about just demonstrate the nature of
[1:02:34] christ on how you talk how you act what
[1:02:37] you do with your life
[1:02:40] everybody will know
[1:02:44] everybody will know
[1:02:52] god wants our old nature changed
[1:02:55] we have a part to play god has a part to
[1:02:57] play
[1:02:59] we can't take possession if we're afraid
[1:03:02] to deal
[1:03:03] with those things
[1:03:06] if you get uncomfortable about those
[1:03:08] things
[1:03:09] you don't want to talk about them you
[1:03:10] want to push them under the rug you you
[1:03:12] don't want to deal with them come on now
[1:03:14] nobody's calling anybody out here nobody
[1:03:22] i'm not saying the devil's not here
[1:03:24] telling everybody
[1:03:27] he's talking about me
[1:03:31] but i respect this pulpit too much to
[1:03:33] ever talk about one person behind the
[1:03:35] pulpit
[1:03:37] that is not the right spirit
[1:03:41] that's god's business
[1:03:45] but we're afraid
[1:03:46] to deal with things that we should be
[1:03:48] dealing with
[1:03:50] and you know what that means
[1:03:51] that means you're afraid of the giants
[1:03:59] you've got to say
[1:04:00] we're more than able
[1:04:03] we're more than able to get the nature
[1:04:05] of christ
[1:04:06] we're more than able to
[1:04:09] to be filled with love
[1:04:12] to too lay down our life for the
[1:04:14] brethren
[1:04:16] we're more than able
[1:04:19] see without the attitude how can we
[1:04:21] possess it
[1:04:23] it's got to start with a free more
[1:04:24] agency
[1:04:25] you've got to believe the promises of
[1:04:28] god if you're always see if you keep
[1:04:30] looking at well i've tried to get rid of
[1:04:31] this i tried to get brother john you
[1:04:32] don't know how many times i tried to get
[1:04:34] rid of this and i can't get rid of it
[1:04:37] that's you
[1:04:38] trusting in you
[1:04:42] but the promise says
[1:04:43] that you can't do all things through
[1:04:45] christ
[1:04:48] we're we are more than able to get the
[1:04:50] nature of christ
[1:04:53] how many joshua caleb's do we got here
[1:04:57] do we do we believe it do we believe it
[1:04:59] we we should be sending a resounding
[1:05:02] amen this this word is for me if it
[1:05:05] ain't for anybody else it's for me
[1:05:11] let's take possession of the very nature
[1:05:13] of jesus christ
[1:05:15] in order to do that we got to take
[1:05:16] possession of the gates the things that
[1:05:18] that come in and out of our lives the
[1:05:20] things that control our lives i've read
[1:05:22] this before i want to read it fast and
[1:05:24] please pray for me because
[1:05:26] i want to finish up today
[1:05:28] and and the and the more you get
[1:05:31] you get the word the more i can keep
[1:05:33] going
[1:05:34] the more you get stuck on something
[1:05:35] hopefully he didn't get stuck somewhere
[1:05:38] romans 6 verse uh chapter 6 verse 16
[1:05:41] says know you not to whom you yield
[1:05:44] yourself
[1:05:45] servants to obey
[1:05:47] his servant you are to me obey whether
[1:05:49] to sin and death or obedience to
[1:05:50] righteousness so every moment that you
[1:05:52] get a thought into your head
[1:05:54] what you do with that thought
[1:05:56] you either believe it or you don't you
[1:05:59] just a decision has to be made
[1:06:02] and if it's the wrong spirit then you're
[1:06:04] obeying the wrong spirit
[1:06:08] yes
[1:06:09] yeah but if you yield
[1:06:11] to the right
[1:06:12] spirit the right thoughts
[1:06:15] let god be thanked
[1:06:16] that ye were the servants of sin but now
[1:06:20] but ye have obeyed from
[1:06:23] the heart what what did you obey from
[1:06:26] the heart
[1:06:27] that form of doctrine which was
[1:06:30] delivered unto you
[1:06:35] we come to church to get the doctrine
[1:06:40] and if you obey it
[1:06:43] a change happens
[1:06:46] a change happens
[1:06:48] god is hidden in simplicity
[1:06:52] romans chapter 6 verse number 12 let us
[1:06:55] let not sin therefore
[1:06:58] reign in your morbid see now you you
[1:07:00] have a choice here that you should obey
[1:07:01] it in the lust thereof let it not
[1:07:04] you see things in your life some
[1:07:05] aggressive nature something that's just
[1:07:07] not right some forwardness some some
[1:07:10] lust whatever it would be you have a
[1:07:13] choice
[1:07:15] to control it
[1:07:16] to not let it rain there
[1:07:18] you have to you have to learn to to
[1:07:20] crucify the flesh to to mortify the
[1:07:23] deeds of the body to take possession of
[1:07:25] those gates
[1:07:27] don't wait for some special speaker to
[1:07:28] come by or some great service for you
[1:07:30] feeling the presence of you would come
[1:07:31] up and you get prayed for
[1:07:39] imagine you
[1:07:40] were the only person left on the planet
[1:07:43] that believed god
[1:07:47] no one would pray for you
[1:07:49] no special service to go to
[1:07:52] but you know you have enough to make it
[1:07:55] god's still here
[1:07:59] it's you and god you don't need anybody
[1:08:01] else
[1:08:04] god changes your nature not another man
[1:08:09] it's god
[1:08:12] just take his yoke upon you learn of him
[1:08:16] be willing to take his nature
[1:08:21] neither he yield ye your members as
[1:08:25] instruments of unrighteousness
[1:08:27] unto sin
[1:08:29] but yield yourselves unto god
[1:08:32] as those that are alive from the dead
[1:08:36] amen
[1:08:37] i'm i'm of the joshua and caleb's
[1:08:42] and your members as instruments of
[1:08:44] righteousness unto god for sin shall not
[1:08:47] have dominion over you
[1:08:49] for you're not under the law but under
[1:08:52] grace
[1:08:53] adam and eve had dominion over
[1:08:56] everything
[1:08:59] and our old nature put us
[1:09:03] under
[1:09:04] the elements of this world that's why
[1:09:07] our nature was to deceive and to lie and
[1:09:10] to trick and to mislead and not say it
[1:09:13] like it is
[1:09:14] come on
[1:09:18] but the promise is that that shall not
[1:09:21] have dominion over us
[1:09:23] and the way for that to happen is to let
[1:09:26] god have dominion in your life
[1:09:29] when god has dominion
[1:09:31] god is the one that conducts the life
[1:09:35] he's the one that
[1:09:36] that says it like it is
[1:09:40] we will take possession
[1:09:42] through
[1:09:43] love
[1:09:44] to your love for god that's it i tell
[1:09:47] you if you your soul you ever been so in
[1:09:50] love with somebody you just do anything
[1:09:51] for them
[1:09:54] you ever just been so filled with hate
[1:09:55] you just never want to talk to that
[1:09:56] person again
[1:09:59] it's simple it's through love that we
[1:10:01] will attain
[1:10:02] the land amen
[1:10:05] i mean joshua and caleb they were of
[1:10:07] another spirit
[1:10:08] they were so in love with with with god
[1:10:12] with the word they they just believed it
[1:10:16] god has bestowed a great love upon us
[1:10:19] the bible says
[1:10:21] and that love is drawing us into his
[1:10:24] image it's pulling us into his image
[1:10:28] that's why the prophet said whatever you
[1:10:29] do get perfect love
[1:10:31] now god chose us for one reason the
[1:10:34] bible says
[1:10:36] well
[1:10:38] he did he said i didn't choose you
[1:10:39] because you were a small number believe
[1:10:41] me this message is small a number
[1:10:42] compared to denominations
[1:10:45] i said but i didn't choose you because
[1:10:47] you were great in number
[1:10:50] he says i chose you because i love you
[1:10:53] i love you
[1:10:55] he loves us this this whole word no
[1:10:57] matter how much it hurts and no matter
[1:11:00] how we we feel that this is this is not
[1:11:02] helping me this is the love of god
[1:11:08] first john chapter 3 verse 2 beloved now
[1:11:10] are we the sons of god and it does not
[1:11:13] yet appear what we shall be but we know
[1:11:14] that when he show up here we shall be
[1:11:17] like him
[1:11:18] for we shall see him as he is
[1:11:21] we shall be like and we're going to be
[1:11:23] in the same image
[1:11:27] now where are you going to see them
[1:11:31] inside of you
[1:11:33] inside
[1:11:35] inside of your motives
[1:11:38] your objectives
[1:11:39] inside of your desires
[1:11:42] inside of
[1:11:44] how you see
[1:11:46] the nature of christ being distributed
[1:11:49] out through these
[1:11:51] three parts of you being preserved
[1:11:53] blameless into the coming of the lord
[1:11:56] are you with me
[1:11:59] and every man that has this hope in him
[1:12:01] do you have that hope
[1:12:04] you're purifying yourself
[1:12:06] you're working on purifying yourself
[1:12:08] even as you already are pure
[1:12:12] right
[1:12:13] but you're still working on purifying
[1:12:15] yourself
[1:12:16] don't make this difficult this is not a
[1:12:19] a black and white you're in or out
[1:12:24] we're in a process
[1:12:26] we're not talking about
[1:12:29] just because we're you hear a a ministry
[1:12:31] here that says press in doesn't mean you
[1:12:34] you you haven't started
[1:12:37] doesn't mean you haven't attained to
[1:12:39] certain things but even if you have
[1:12:40] attained to certain things paul said you
[1:12:42] need to have the same attitude as if you
[1:12:44] haven't attained to it
[1:12:51] not every man has an attitude
[1:12:54] like peter
[1:12:56] a lot of people do oh i'm ready lord i'm
[1:12:59] ready
[1:13:02] we got to have
[1:13:04] an attitude of pressing in
[1:13:07] if you have this hope that you're going
[1:13:09] to be ready you're going to press in
[1:13:13] until you see christ manifested in the
[1:13:16] parts of your life that you haven't seen
[1:13:17] him in the past
[1:13:20] brother branham says we put out an
[1:13:21] atmosphere of what's inside of us that's
[1:13:24] all we can do
[1:13:26] you want things different on the outside
[1:13:28] of you change the inside
[1:13:31] as a man thinketh in his heart so is he
[1:13:34] amen i just i need to skip some things
[1:13:37] but you know how many uh how many is
[1:13:39] feeling good this this morning
[1:13:42] it's okay if you stand up shake wake up
[1:13:44] do whatever you got to do
[1:13:45] i don't want you to miss this but you go
[1:13:47] back listen to it i suppose
[1:13:49] brother bam said in the message souls
[1:13:50] that are in prison now he said that's
[1:13:52] why we're baptized into his name that we
[1:13:55] might come forth in his name in his
[1:13:57] death and his resurrection that will we
[1:13:59] will rise again testify to the world
[1:14:02] that we have new life
[1:14:06] testifying to the world that we have new
[1:14:09] life that the old man is dead we're
[1:14:12] going to testify that the old man is
[1:14:14] dead
[1:14:17] we buried the first nature
[1:14:21] you notice you've taken possession of
[1:14:23] the land you're not in and out
[1:14:26] the first nature is gone
[1:14:30] and now we are the nature of him
[1:14:34] he lives in us
[1:14:36] and we don't do our own will
[1:14:39] we do his will
[1:14:41] we don't think our own thoughts
[1:14:46] that's why we should never say i'm going
[1:14:47] to go here i'm going to go there i'm
[1:14:48] going to do this i'm going to do that
[1:14:50] what's going on here
[1:14:54] the mind that was in christ jesus is in
[1:14:57] every believer
[1:15:00] jesus said in meth or hebrews chapter 10
[1:15:03] verse 7 just just quoting
[1:15:05] that uh then said i lo i come in the
[1:15:10] volume of the book it is written of me
[1:15:13] what to do thy will of god that's what
[1:15:15] the nature change is
[1:15:17] the nature change is not just stopping
[1:15:20] doing bad things but it's actually doing
[1:15:22] the will of god amen
[1:15:27] acts 5 32 says and we are witnesses of
[1:15:30] these things and so is the holy ghost
[1:15:31] whom god has given to him to them that
[1:15:34] obey him
[1:15:36] you want more holy ghost obey more
[1:15:41] god gives his divine nature to them that
[1:15:43] obey him
[1:15:44] there's a part that we play the part of
[1:15:46] crucifying our carnal nature denying our
[1:15:49] will
[1:15:50] the part of believing it will happen in
[1:15:52] other words exercising our faith
[1:15:56] i always remember
[1:15:58] the story that uh sister uh
[1:16:02] uh
[1:16:03] sue bailey
[1:16:05] when she gave her heart to the lord
[1:16:07] jesus and brother brother bill and
[1:16:09] and uh they were still had habits
[1:16:12] hanging on them and they knew they were
[1:16:14] bad habits
[1:16:16] but every every time they get down to
[1:16:18] pray they still prayed as if if
[1:16:20] god was going to deliver them and god
[1:16:22] delivered them and that's the way you
[1:16:23] need to believe you just to be serious
[1:16:25] with god be sincere with god mean
[1:16:27] business because if you don't want it
[1:16:29] enough it's just not going to happen
[1:16:31] it's not going to happen we pay we play
[1:16:35] the part of praise and worship
[1:16:41] we thank god in other words for
[1:16:43] delivering us
[1:16:44] for filling us
[1:16:47] now we're not bigger than the devil
[1:16:48] we're not going to defeat the devil in
[1:16:50] some psychology some intellectual
[1:16:52] knowledge of the scriptures
[1:16:55] we're just like grasshoppers
[1:16:57] in the sight of devils
[1:17:00] remember they said jesus i know paul i
[1:17:02] know but who are you
[1:17:05] we're not stronger and we're not wiser
[1:17:07] than the devil
[1:17:09] but greater is he that's in you than he
[1:17:11] that's in the world
[1:17:13] our faith is in christ the word amen
[1:17:17] we're more than conquerors to him that
[1:17:19] loved us
[1:17:20] we can do all things through christ
[1:17:23] and we need to believe that
[1:17:28] peter was prayed for by jesus that his
[1:17:30] faith would fail not and that when he
[1:17:32] was converted
[1:17:36] now jesus prayed for us as well we read
[1:17:38] it
[1:17:41] and when he prayed for our oneness
[1:17:43] he prayed for our conversion for that
[1:17:45] nature change
[1:17:49] and i love this because
[1:17:53] no matter how much satan wants to sift
[1:17:55] us like wheat
[1:17:57] we had the greatest one that could ever
[1:17:59] pray for us
[1:18:00] pray for us
[1:18:02] and you got to believe he prayed for you
[1:18:05] [Music]
[1:18:07] not i wish he did i hope he did i think
[1:18:09] no you've got to believe he prayed for
[1:18:12] me
[1:18:13] he's going to see you through
[1:18:19] god is still
[1:18:20] making men in his image
[1:18:25] with his divine nature ii peter we're
[1:18:26] almost done you just please bear with me
[1:18:33] according as his divine nature
[1:18:37] uh according to his divine power have
[1:18:39] given unto us all things that pertain
[1:18:42] unto life
[1:18:43] and godliness
[1:18:45] through the knowledge of him that called
[1:18:46] us to glory and future
[1:18:48] virtue whereby are given unto us
[1:18:50] exceeding great and precious promises
[1:18:53] and that by these we might be partakers
[1:18:57] of what
[1:19:00] this is the land that god promised us
[1:19:03] the divine nature having
[1:19:07] the corruption
[1:19:09] that is in the world
[1:19:11] through lust
[1:19:13] see satan wants us
[1:19:15] to be content
[1:19:18] with the old nature in our
[1:19:20] life because we still got god
[1:19:25] he doesn't want us to be focusing
[1:19:28] on the things
[1:19:29] on more of god's divine nature
[1:19:32] but if you love god don't don't you want
[1:19:35] more of him in you
[1:19:36] yes
[1:19:39] let the promise let this word that god
[1:19:42] has promised come into your heart
[1:19:44] not not just your mind but your heart i
[1:19:46] got a couple
[1:19:47] a couple quotes here to read one is from
[1:19:50] end time sign
[1:19:52] seed brother branham says and by
[1:19:54] accepting then his word
[1:19:59] look at the simplicity of this
[1:20:01] and by accepting then his word brings
[1:20:04] life and brings christ back into us
[1:20:07] because christ is the word
[1:20:10] the spoken word and it will mature if
[1:20:13] you re if you can receive it
[1:20:16] he says you that sick accept it believe
[1:20:20] it
[1:20:21] it's got to mature it will come forth in
[1:20:24] its season it's got to so i don't care
[1:20:26] if you don't feel it
[1:20:30] it's okay you don't feel it you should
[1:20:32] better testify you received it
[1:20:36] and and there's a difference of just
[1:20:37] receiving it in your head
[1:20:39] and receiving now you need your head
[1:20:41] you need these gates
[1:20:43] right it's got to come through these
[1:20:46] amen to get in here
[1:20:49] that free more agency this this this
[1:20:51] word is real to me lord this word is so
[1:20:54] real to me i want it down on the inside
[1:20:57] in the message greatest battle ever
[1:20:59] fought brother man said it must be
[1:21:00] accepted in the mind
[1:21:02] then it's believed in the heart
[1:21:04] then the word of god becomes a reality
[1:21:08] then every senses of the soul and body
[1:21:12] is scoured out with the holy spirit
[1:21:15] then your senses of god your conscience
[1:21:18] of god everything that godly flows
[1:21:20] through you
[1:21:21] there's not a doubt anywhere
[1:21:23] there's nothing
[1:21:25] that can rise
[1:21:26] up possession
[1:21:30] but if that channel
[1:21:32] it
[1:21:33] but if that channel has been cleared out
[1:21:35] and been purged and been filled on the
[1:21:38] inside with the holy ghost
[1:21:40] that don't even come into memory no more
[1:21:42] miss jones
[1:21:44] and what she did
[1:21:47] you ever just been tempted to talk about
[1:21:49] somebody
[1:21:52] that's not the holy ghost
[1:21:56] i i was doing that when i was in the
[1:21:57] world
[1:22:01] i don't do that right if god puts
[1:22:04] anybody on your heart it's so you pray
[1:22:06] for them
[1:22:11] remember you all remember brother
[1:22:13] lafontaine i should have told you i had
[1:22:14] a lot of hay on my fork like brother
[1:22:16] lafontaine used to say when he'd come
[1:22:19] one time brother lafontaine was
[1:22:21] ministering he was telling us about this
[1:22:23] woman that had this uh
[1:22:27] habit of just talking about somebody
[1:22:30] and she'd start out by saying oh praise
[1:22:33] god brother john do you remember sister
[1:22:35] celincel
[1:22:37] oh glory to god she had this problem
[1:22:44] if we're going to talk about somebody
[1:22:46] let's say something good let's esteem
[1:22:48] them better than ourselves
[1:22:49] if we can't do that bow your head and
[1:22:51] pray
[1:22:52] you don't need to open your mouth you're
[1:22:54] just letting the devil in
[1:22:56] when you open your mouth to say
[1:22:58] something negative about something
[1:22:59] you're letting the devil in
[1:23:06] he says it's you and god together and
[1:23:09] nobody else but you too see
[1:23:11] oneness that nature change
[1:23:13] he says there you are there's your
[1:23:16] battle
[1:23:17] keep him at the beginning
[1:23:20] stop him dead in the track if it ain't
[1:23:23] how long you can make the war linger
[1:23:26] stop it right now
[1:23:29] don't be satisfied with the things that
[1:23:31] are stuck in your life get serious about
[1:23:33] getting them out
[1:23:37] if you'll come and you'll keep them
[1:23:39] memories and conscious and everything
[1:23:41] thinking about well i might fail it
[1:23:43] might not be right
[1:23:45] he says don't do that at all you throw
[1:23:48] everything aside and open up the channel
[1:23:50] and say god your word is eternally true
[1:23:55] and it's for me if the whole church
[1:23:58] fails
[1:24:00] if the whole world fails
[1:24:03] yet i can't fail
[1:24:06] because i'm taking your word
[1:24:09] he said that's the battle
[1:24:12] that's the thing amen let's stand
[1:24:14] together
[1:24:21] i'm just going to read romans chapter 8
[1:24:23] verse 17
[1:24:25] 17 18-19 and if children then heirs
[1:24:29] heirs of god join heirs with christ
[1:24:32] if so be
[1:24:33] that we suffer with him
[1:24:36] that we
[1:24:37] may be also glorified together
[1:24:41] now that suffering is we've got to be
[1:24:43] willing to take possession of the gates
[1:24:46] be willing to crucify the flesh be
[1:24:49] willing to
[1:24:50] die out to ourself
[1:24:52] that's the only way that we'll be
[1:24:54] glorified together that's the part we
[1:24:56] play for i reckon
[1:24:58] that these sufferings that we're going
[1:25:00] through
[1:25:02] of this present time they're not worthy
[1:25:04] to be compared with the glory that shall
[1:25:05] be revealed in us
[1:25:08] for the earnest expectation
[1:25:10] of the creature waited for the
[1:25:12] manifestation of the sons of god
[1:25:18] defense since the time of the beginning
[1:25:21] till now
[1:25:23] all of earth has been waiting for us to
[1:25:26] manifest
[1:25:28] that do adam and eve
[1:25:33] and it's in your hands
[1:25:35] how to get there
[1:25:37] you've been
[1:25:39] i believe the lord has shown us in these
[1:25:41] services
[1:25:43] that
[1:25:44] our soul
[1:25:46] is the thing that we ought to be
[1:25:47] focusing on
[1:25:51] and
[1:25:52] the nature is what needs to be changed
[1:25:55] so
[1:25:56] so
[1:25:57] i want to see and hear more testimonies
[1:26:00] about our nature changing what's wrong
[1:26:01] with that testimony
[1:26:04] my nature's changing
[1:26:06] i mean those of us that had habits
[1:26:09] you know bad habits and god took them
[1:26:11] away we didn't mind testifying to that
[1:26:15] well why not testify the other things
[1:26:18] maybe swear words that come out every
[1:26:19] now and then they don't come out anymore
[1:26:22] what you think is not a big thing
[1:26:24] testify of it
[1:26:26] because it builds faith your testimony
[1:26:28] builds faith in the church builds faith
[1:26:30] in others
[1:26:32] this word is is real and god
[1:26:34] god wants us to manifest him and i know
[1:26:37] that we may look at this this seriously
[1:26:39] man we got a long ways to go brother
[1:26:40] john i don't know if this is attainable
[1:26:42] you got to stop looking at this as far
[1:26:45] as your ability
[1:26:46] if you do you're just going to get
[1:26:48] scared and walk out of the promised land
[1:26:51] you've got to look at this and say
[1:26:53] whatever god said he promised it's going
[1:26:54] to happen i don't know how but it's
[1:26:56] going to happen
