[37:07] we are strangers and we are PMS here
[37:12] amen we are looking for a city amen
[37:15] which has
[37:17] Foundation which God himself is the
[37:19] Builder of it

[37:25] let's keep trusting the Lord
[37:28] for soon and very soon we shall see the
[37:33] king Hallelujah let's read this evening
[37:37] from The Book of Romans chapter
[37:39] 4 and just to encourage
[37:43] ourselves Romans chapter
[37:50] 4 let us read from
[37:53] verse
[37:55] 13 Romans 4 13
[38:01] down for the promise that he should be
[38:05] the heir of the
[38:08] world was not to Abraham or to his seed
[38:13] through the
[38:15] law but through the righteousness of
[38:19] Faith
[38:21] amen for if they which are of the Lord
[38:24] be
[38:25] H faith is made
[38:28] void and the
[38:30] promise made of none
[38:35] effect because the law WTH
[38:39] rough but where no law is there is no
[38:45] transgression
[38:47] therefore it is of
[38:50] faith that it might be by
[38:53] grace to the end the promise
[38:58] might be sure might be sure to all the
[39:03] seed not to that only which is of the
[39:08] law but to that also which is of the
[39:12] faith of
[39:14] Abraham who is the father of us
[39:19] all as it is
[39:22] written I have made thee a father of
[39:25] many nations
[39:28] before him whom he believed even
[39:33] God who quickeneth the dead and call
[39:38] those things which be not as though they
[39:43] were who against hope believed in
[39:48] hope that he might become the father of
[39:52] many
[39:53] nations according to that which was
[39:56] spoken
[39:57] so shall thy seed
[40:01] be and being not weak in faith he
[40:05] considered not his own body now
[40:09] dead when he was about 100 years
[40:13] old neither yet the deadness of Sir
[40:19] womb he ster not at the promise of God
[40:23] through
[40:24] unbelief but was strong in
[40:28] Faith giving glory to God Amen and be
[40:33] fully
[40:34] persuaded that what he had
[40:38] promised he was able also to perform
[40:43] right therefore it was imputed to him
[40:47] for
[40:49] righteousness now it was not written for
[40:52] his sake alone that it was imputed to
[40:56] him
[40:58] but to us also to whom it shall be
[41:02] imputed if we believe on him that raised
[41:06] up Jesus our lord from the
[41:10] dead who was delivered for our
[41:15] offences and was raised again for our
[41:20] justification may the Lord bless the
[41:22] reading of his word amen shall we please
[41:27] be
[41:30] seated praise the Lord
[41:33] hallelujah so we once again greet you in
[41:37] the name of our Lord and Savior Jesus
[41:40] Christ amen and I want to thank you

[42:39] air will not be coming here we meeting
[42:42] up in the
[42:43] air yes it is a promise that the lord
[42:47] gave us and he always keeps his promises
[42:51] Hallelujah and so this evening just to
[42:54] encourage ourselves
[42:57] we are speaking
[42:59] on consider the promises of God
[43:04] am consider the promises of
[43:08] God we are speaking of this great
[43:11] character in the
[43:13] scriptures that is the man
[43:18] Abraham a great
[43:20] character and he was called the friend
[43:23] of God think about it
[43:27] a man that God said to himself when he
[43:30] was on his way to destroy Sodom and
[43:34] gomorra and God stopped and he said
[43:37] should I hide this from Abraham God said
[43:40] no I will tell him about it and he spoke
[43:43] and talked to God as a
[43:47] friend and he put a request to God what
[43:50] about this why don't you do it this way
[43:52] and go well if I get 40 men I get I will
[43:55] not say oh no okay what about if you
[43:57] don't get
[43:59] 40 what about that and God said um okay
[44:04] okay if I get 30 that would be okay okay
[44:07] but if you don't get 30 what are you
[44:08] going to do and he as a friend what a
[44:13] wonderful thing to be a friend of God
[44:16] Amen and so Jesus said I call you not
[44:20] servants ye are my friends amen so we
[44:23] are his
[44:25] friends What a Wonder ful people we are
[44:28] what a blessed people we are we should
[44:31] not forget who we are and we should make
[44:34] sure we don't lose our identities am cuz
[44:39] it's very po important not to lose your
[44:41] identity because we are in the world
[44:43] that people don't know who they are
[44:46] whether they are men or they are women
[44:48] they are boys or they are girls or they
[44:50] they the the people have lost their
[44:53] identity right Men Behaving like women
[44:56] women behaving like men yes you know may
[45:00] God help us there is something about a
[45:04] Christian that word Christian means
[45:09] Christlike amen so that name that we
[45:14] call ourselves or put upon us we should
[45:18] not allow
[45:20] anything for that name to be questioned
[45:23] Christ because whatever we do it reflect
[45:27] on the
[45:29] Lord because when you say Christian is
[45:32] Christlike right amen so everything that
[45:35] we are doing today it reflects on the
[45:38] Lord amen may God help us that our
[45:43] lives our conduct and behavior will
[45:47] glorify the Lord Jesus
[45:51] Christ the righteous one the just one
[45:56] the one man that stood there and pilate
[45:58] said I find no fault with
[46:02] him even Judas who betrayed him said I
[46:05] found no F I have betrayed the innocent
[46:10] blood and Herod said he didn't find
[46:14] fault with
[46:16] him may God help us to live such a life
[46:19] amen that his name will be
[46:23] glorified
[46:25] so the prophet phet of God I read from
[46:27] me said we are speaking tonight upon
[46:31] faith and I thought it would be nice
[46:34] maybe if we would use this great
[46:37] character of Abraham for an example of
[46:42] Faith because it was to Abraham the
[46:47] promise was
[46:49] given and we will kind of review the
[46:53] life of Abraham just a little
[46:57] because he was an outstanding
[47:02] character and he was a man who believed
[47:08] God he was an outstanding
[47:13] character and he was a man who believed
[47:16] in God may the Lord help
[47:20] us and
[47:22] now he had no great background of
[47:27] no great background to believe God
[47:30] because it's commonly believed that he
[47:33] was from a family of idolators idol
[47:38] worshippers he came down from Babylon
[47:41] his family dwelt in their land in the
[47:44] land of the chadians the city of O The
[47:47] Valleys of sha and was just an ordinary
[47:54] man so he was not not an angel he was an
[47:59] ordinary
[48:01] man and we read in the scripture how God
[48:05] called
[48:07] him say Abraham or Abraham come out from
[48:13] your
[48:14] nation from your Kindred from your
[48:18] father's house and I will show you where
[48:21] to go hallelujah amen so as God called
[48:26] Abraham
[48:27] that is how he called every Seed of
[48:31] Abraham and remember that God's word
[48:35] always calls for total separation from
[48:41] unbelief
[48:42] amen from unbelief God want us to
[48:46] believe his
[48:49] word because a man and his word is the
[48:53] same so God and His word is the same
[48:59] just like you and your word is the same
[49:01] amen so if you say one thing and you do
[49:04] something else that is
[49:08] hypocrisy so we are taught in the
[49:11] scriptures that our Y Must Be Y and our
[49:16] n might be n amen praise the Lord amen
[49:20] may the Lord help us so this great
[49:23] character Abraham that what was
[49:27] called from the land of
[49:30] Babylon from idol
[49:35] worship praise the
[49:37] Lord and he
[49:39] said he had no great background of to
[49:43] believe God because it is commonly
[49:46] believed that he was from a family of
[49:48] idol
[49:50] worshippers so he had no background that
[49:53] oh the Father the parent no no no no
[49:55] they were all ID the worshippers and he
[49:58] was called and he said
[50:01] here and
[50:05] uh he he was an ordinary
[50:09] man just like you and just like me right
[50:14] and he said he wasn't no
[50:17] angel he was just a man like you and
[50:23] I and God looking over the Earth
[50:27] to see for a man that he could put
[50:30] confidence
[50:31] in God looking over the Earth to see a
[50:36] man that he could put confidence
[50:40] in God uses a
[50:43] man God ants for a man
[50:48] amen he always uses man because man is
[50:52] God's
[50:55] agent that's why when when he want to
[50:57] bring the children of Israel out of
[50:59] Egypt he was looking for a
[51:01] man the Bible say when he came down he
[51:05] heard the Cry of the children of
[51:08] Israel nobody knew what was happening
[51:11] the children of Israel were being
[51:14] Afflicted they were being
[51:17] persecuted they were being
[51:20] tormented they did not go to Egypt as
[51:24] slaves when they were in Egypt they had
[51:26] the best because of
[51:31] Joseph they were very special they were
[51:33] given everything the
[51:35] best but then the Bible says there arose
[51:39] a pharaoh that didn't know Joseph and
[51:42] because the time that God gave the
[51:45] promise was at hand because God had told
[51:50] Abraham years back
[51:53] amen when Abraham had known
[51:58] child God gave a promise to him and God
[52:03] told him your seed will be in a Strange
[52:07] Land for 400 years right amen and after
[52:12] that I will come and I will deliver
[52:15] them why did he choose 400 years I don't
[52:18] know but that's his choice that's what
[52:20] he
[52:21] said so God has a purpose for everything
[52:26] yeah amen God don't please man he
[52:29] pleases himself amen and none of us are
[52:34] here just for being
[52:36] here we are here for a
[52:39] purpose and somebody brought us here and
[52:44] the one that brought us here has a
[52:46] purpose for
[52:48] it he a god of
[52:51] varieties yes he is so he give somebody
[52:55] black skin and yellow skin and whatever
[52:58] we are all colored people amen color
[53:01] blue color yellow we are all
[53:03] colored amen because he's a god of
[53:06] variety he made the mountains and he
[53:08] made The Valleys
[53:09] am he made tall people and short people
[53:12] he's God he doesn't make
[53:16] mistakes Hallelujah so we should be glad
[53:20] and we should be happy for what God has
[53:22] made us
[53:24] amen hallelujah we should be thankful to
[53:27] God for making
[53:29] us the way he has made us we should
[53:33] maintain
[53:34] it
[53:36] amen
[53:37] hallelujah because it's not by mistake
[53:41] that we are the way we
[53:43] are blessed be the name of the Lord this
[53:46] word we are in today remember if you're
[53:49] a Christian the Bible tells us that this
[53:52] word is not our own we are strangers we
[53:56] are pilgrims on Earth and God don't want
[53:59] us
[54:02] to lose our focus of that we are going
[54:08] somewhere he don't want us to conform to
[54:11] this word amen he said we should be
[54:14] conformed to Christ amen to his word
[54:17] amen may the Lord help us amen
[54:21] hallelujah so he
[54:24] c as he came on the
[54:26] Mount and then he saw this young man
[54:30] there oh he was about maybe 40 years
[54:33] because he Liv in 40 years he went to
[54:35] the back side of the desert 40 years he
[54:37] came back for 40 years so he had three
[54:40] 40s so at this time maybe about uh he
[54:43] was a man of maybe about 40 years or 40
[54:47] something years or whatever age and God
[54:49] called him said I have seen the
[54:51] Affliction of my people it was God that
[54:54] told him I have heard the Cry of my
[54:56] people right so remember this he hears
[54:58] your cry amen he hears your prayers he
[55:02] knows all that is happening amen and he
[55:05] has appointed a time for
[55:07] deliverance a time for
[55:11] manifestation he came and he told Moses
[55:14] Moses didn't know he said but I am the
[55:16] god of
[55:18] Abraham I am the god of Isaac I am the
[55:21] god of Israel I am the god of your
[55:24] father and your mother the amra and yed
[55:27] I am that God that's right Hallelujah
[55:31] he's God today he knows about our
[55:35] afflictions he knows about our trials he
[55:38] knows about our pains he knows
[55:43] everything he has not forgotten you and
[55:47] he will not forget any of his
[55:49] own his promises are yeah and amen and
[55:53] remember he watches over his word
[55:56] to perform
[55:58] it and so he meets this man and he
[56:02] said he called his name he said
[56:05] Moses and he knows your name
[56:08] too
[56:10] am he knows your name he know wherever
[56:13] you are at any
[56:16] time Hallelujah he knows all about it
[56:19] because he's the god of creation that
[56:22] created the heavens and the Earth that
[56:25] knows everything that is happening today
[56:28] in America and the world I say oh
[56:31] amen every flee and every fly he knows
[56:34] all and he knows the thoughts that we
[56:38] think that's why he told Moses even when
[56:43] they were to leave Egypt he told Moses
[56:45] pass this way and when you pass this way
[56:48] the way of the Red Sea Pharaoh will
[56:51] think you are
[56:52] stranded and he will come after you and
[56:55] I will meet him there
[56:57] he know all things Jesus speaking to the
[57:00] disciples and telling them about the
[57:02] crucifixion and he told them what will
[57:05] happen to him and I'm going to Jerusalem
[57:07] and this will happen and when he was to
[57:09] enter Jerusalem say you go to this side
[57:11] you meet a man he's carrying something
[57:14] and ask that man where is that chamber
[57:17] for the master to have supper with his
[57:20] people and He will show you a
[57:23] place so he knows all amen Hallelujah
[57:27] that's the God we are serving today and
[57:29] when you know that this is the God you
[57:32] are serving it will make you to relax
[57:36] amen and you will rest because
[57:38] Christianity is resting yes resting rest
[57:44] resting in your God Amen knowing that he
[57:47] knows all about it and that nothing can
[57:51] overtake him right and also nothing can
[57:55] happen to you
[57:56] without he knowing it in know all
[58:00] because our life Journey has been
[58:02] pre-planned and pre-arranged by him so
[58:05] he knows whatever will be at every
[58:08] Junction every mile of the way that is
[58:11] the God we are Serv and this God want
[58:14] you to believe him am that I am the
[58:18] Creator that's why told Moses I am that
[58:21] I am amen I am the beginning and I am
[58:25] the End Amen I am the alpha and I am the
[58:28] Omega I am the way and I am the truth I
[58:31] am the all in all I am the Healer I am
[58:35] the deliverer I am your protection I am
[58:38] your peace I am your joy I am your way I
[58:41] am your life I am everything to you
[58:45] amen I know all about it amen he knows
[58:48] all about you am
[58:51] Hallelujah he want
[58:53] us to believe him
[58:58] yes he said to Moses I have seen also he
[59:02] sees
[59:03] too I have seen and I have
[59:07] heard so he says us it does not matter
[59:11] where you are it does not matter the
[59:14] condition it does not matter what it
[59:16] sees as because his eyes is on us and he
[59:21] watches over Us by day and by night
[59:25] remember
[59:26] there is no darkness in his
[59:30] sight day and night is the same to
[59:33] God it don't use light electricity
[59:36] doesn't use it it doesn't need
[59:38] it that's why in the city for square
[59:42] there will not be the sunand light there
[59:45] we will not need this s o n and we don't
[59:47] need electricity there the Bible said
[59:50] the lamp shall be the light of the city
[59:54] amen amen the City for
[59:57] square think on God's promises he gives
[1:00:01] strength and he gives courage
[1:00:05] amen I've seen it I've heard it and I
[1:00:08] have come
[1:00:10] down but I want to send
[1:00:14] you he has no hands but your
[1:00:17] hands no legs or feet but ours so he
[1:00:22] wants us to surrender to him and when we
[1:00:25] surrender to him then just like this
[1:00:28] coat he will wear it right so you become
[1:00:32] his
[1:00:33] coat he dress in you he walk in you he
[1:00:38] speaks in us he does whatever he does
[1:00:41] through
[1:00:44] us may the Lord help usen so that we can
[1:00:47] yield to him amen we can surrender to
[1:00:54] him when he was to send Moses and he
[1:00:57] spoke to Moses Moses said who am I how
[1:00:59] can I go to Pharaoh because he has run
[1:01:03] away from Egypt and they want to kill
[1:01:04] him and God say you don't have to worry
[1:01:06] about that I will go with
[1:01:09] you I will go with you oh may God go
[1:01:13] with us am and may we have that
[1:01:15] assurance that he said he will not leave
[1:01:18] us so he is with us no matter the
[1:01:22] challenge is more than able to s as true

[1:01:32] great character Abraham he wasn't no
[1:01:36] angel he was just a man like you and
[1:01:41] I and God looking over the Earth to

[1:24:25] he considered not his own body dead
[1:24:29] neither the deadness of serious womb it
[1:24:33] didn't consider that one yes Sarah's was
[1:24:36] dead Sarah was P the age of monopos and
[1:24:39] Sarah has been written of by the doctors
[1:24:42] that this thing cannot be cure no
[1:24:45] healing to this no Deliverance to
[1:24:48] this but Abraham didn't consider what
[1:24:51] the doctor
[1:24:52] said Medical
[1:24:55] medically there was no way for Sarah to
[1:24:58] give birth medically but not
[1:25:01] godly not
[1:25:03] supernaturally not with almighty
[1:25:06] God yes thank God for the doctors thank
[1:25:09] God for whatever they are doing thank
[1:25:11] God for it Hallelujah but they don't
[1:25:14] have the F
[1:25:16] say God has the
[1:25:19] fin God is the
[1:25:21] creator the doctors they learn you you
[1:25:24] know about the body here and there but
[1:25:26] God is the creator of the body

[1:47:45] staggered not at the promise of God
[1:47:47] through unbelief right he was strong

[1:48:23] Abraham we've got to have that kind of
[1:48:27] Faith amen regardless of
[1:48:33] what the symptoms
[1:48:36] say like Jonah when he was swallowed by
[1:48:40] the fish he didn't consider those
[1:48:44] symtoms think about a man in the belly
[1:48:47] of a fish swallowed by a fish
[1:48:50] Jonah in the belly of the fish at the
[1:48:54] bottom of the sea lying down there and
[1:48:58] Jonah said these are lying vanities I'm
[1:49:02] not going to consider these things I'm
[1:49:04] not considering where I am I'm
[1:49:05] considering the word of the Lord the
[1:49:07] word of the Lord said if we are in
[1:49:09] trouble and we look up to the temple and
[1:49:12] pray God will hear our
[1:49:16] prayer so he did not consider where he
[1:49:19] was he did not consider the womb of the
[1:49:22] of the of the of the whe he did not
[1:49:24] consider all the RS that were around him
[1:49:26] he did not consider the dep of the ocean
[1:49:29] where the fish was late sleeping he
[1:49:32] didn't consider he only considered the
[1:49:35] promise God say so and he said now I
[1:49:38] will look to the temple how did he look
[1:49:40] to the temple by faith amen because in
[1:49:44] the belly of the way how is he going to
[1:49:45] turn and no no no but by faith he set
[1:49:49] his mind he I'm looking to the temple
[1:49:52] I'm looking to the promise I'm holding
[1:49:54] to the word of the Lord God says so that
[1:49:56] wherever will be he didn't mention when
[1:49:59] he was given a promise they didn't
[1:50:00] mention whe or fish he said wherever
[1:50:04] whatever the condition whatever the
[1:50:06] situation if you look to this Temple and
[1:50:08] pray I will hear you and job the Bible
[1:50:12] say Jonah he looked to the temple how I
[1:50:14] don't know I just believe what the Bible
[1:50:17] said and he prayed and he said I'm not
[1:50:20] going to observe these things these are
[1:50:22] Liv ities yes the doctor said this yes

[1:50:34] done wrong but be merciful to me make a
[1:50:37] way for me bring me out of this
[1:50:39] problem change the situation Jehovah of
[1:50:43] Miracles he considered that promise and
[1:50:46] the Bible say when he prayed God spoke
[1:50:49] to the fish think about that God spoke
[1:50:53] to the
[1:50:54] fish fish your time your holiday is

[1:51:17] and the fish move out move out why
[1:51:20] didn't Jonah die there because God has a
[1:51:23] purpose for his life
[1:51:25] am he has to preach the gospel he has to
[1:51:29] go and testify amen woo
[1:51:34] Hallelujah If Abraham didn't consider
[1:51:37] the deadness of sah womb but said what
[1:51:40] about your own body that is alive

[1:51:59] God changed
[1:52:05] it
[1:52:07] hallelujah oh praise be to God may the
[1:52:11] Lord help us look at Noah way back in
[1:52:14] Genesis when God spoke to Noah that day
[1:52:18] the word of the Lord came to Noah and
[1:52:19] told him to build an ark for the saving
[1:52:21] of his household and you know the word
[1:52:24] stood upright before the anti anti-
[1:52:26] Delian destruction it wasn't leaning
[1:52:29] back like this today to bring water and
[1:52:32] when God told Noah he was going to send
[1:52:34] a flood a rain why you know he had
[1:52:39] critics but Faith doesn't look at what
[1:52:42] the circumstances is Faith looks to what
[1:52:46] God says faith don't try to rais him
[1:52:49] Faith just TS God at his faith value
