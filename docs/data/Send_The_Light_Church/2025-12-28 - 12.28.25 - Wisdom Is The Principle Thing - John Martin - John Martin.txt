By the grace of God, we're all white as snow. And his blood is just as powerful today. &gt;&gt; Amen. It didn't lose one ounce of its power. &gt;&gt; Amen. I just want to say God bless you this this morning. You some of you driven long distances to be here. Um may God richly bless you today. Give you uh a special blessing. And uh it's so good to see Brother Dennis's wife, Ella. Um what a joy was to meet you this morning. May you may you feel home and and feel God. That's that's why we're really here &gt;&gt; is to meet with him and to receive from him. Amen. &gt;&gt; And I do believe that God always meets our expectation. &gt;&gt; I do believe that. Um well, if you have your Bible and you like to turn with us this morning to Proverbs, uh chapter 4, and we're just going to read one verse there, um and have you be uh seated um after we have a word of prayer. Amen. This morning, we want to talk about uh wisdom. Um, how many's ever wanted a little bit more wisdom or wish you had more wisdom? &gt;&gt; Um, well, um, this scripture is full of what wisdom really is. Um, how to get it, how to retain it, and what it can do for your lives. And we're going to do a lot of reading uh this morning, but it's all going to be out of the Bible. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Let's just read the one verse here and then we'll have a word of prayer. Proverbs chapter 4 verse number seven. Wisdom is the principle thing. Therefore, get wisdom and with all thy getting get understanding. Amen. Let's look to the Lord a word of prayer. Our heavenly father, Lord, thank you for watching over us all and bringing us here safely. We just thank you for this building that we have here with heat in it and and a roof to protect us from the rain and the cold. Now, Lord, we just pray that you'd come in the furtherance of this service. We do thank you, Lord, for the opportunity that we've had to to worship you in song, to lift up your name. Lord, we want to continue to worship you as your word comes forth. Father, may it find a hiding place in our hearts. I pray Lord for every one of us that we could just catch a glimpse of the wisdom that's from above today. We commit the service in our lives in your hands. Now receive glory through each one of us. We pray in Jesus Christ's name we ask it. Amen. God bless you. May be seated. If you look up uh that principle thing, wisdom is the principle thing. Therefore, get wisdom. The principal thing is the foundational truth that serves as a foundation for a belief behavior and for a chain of reasoning. So wisdom saying it's the principle thing the foundation the the most important and too often we don't think about wisdom enough &gt;&gt; as it being the foundation. It might be well one that we can grab here and there but um uh Solomon is saying it's the principal thing. Of course we know Solomon uh he was a man full of wisdom and he he wrote Proverbs and that's full of wisdom. &gt;&gt; Um wisdom is separated from everything else. It stands alone as a principle thing. It will take you places that nothing else can take you. It'll help you like nothing else can help you. Um, and because of wisdom, we could say that, and I want to read this here if you want to turn with me to Matthew chapter 2. Because of the wisdom, the wise men recognized the word for their hour and followed the light to Christ. &gt;&gt; And God is still leading wise men to himself. And that's why we are all here because of [clears throat] we believe with all of our heart the word of God is what we need to get more of Christ. Amen. &gt;&gt; So I just thought you know since last service we we talked about uh the birth of Christ and its purpose and and today we talk about the the wise men because they actually happened after the birth, right? It didn't happen at the same time. you you don't hardly find nativity scenes, very many of them uh that don't have the wise men included in them. Uh but we do know uh that it happened a couple years after. So we just kind of want to read this as a foundation here in Matthew chapter 2 verse one. It says, "Now when Jesus was born in Bethlehem of Judea in the days of Herod the king, behold, there came wise men from the east to Jerusalem, saying, Where is he that is born king of the Jews? For we have seen his star in the east, and come to worship him." Notice their motive was to come and worship. Amen. &gt;&gt; That's why we come to church. &gt;&gt; Really, we come to worship him. &gt;&gt; The first thing these wise men wanted to do after traveling through hardship for two years through their journey, through their suffering, they just wanted to worship. &gt;&gt; And I'll tell you, it's worth going through everything to come to the house of the Lord and worship. The Bible says that the father seeketh such that it will worship him in he's looking for those that are interested and I believe in that is wisdom. Verse three, when Herod the king had heard these things, he was troubled and all Jerusalem with him. What? What? There's a new king. And when he had gathered all the chief priests and the scribes of the people together, he demanded them where Christ should be born. And they said unto him, "In Bethlehem of Judea, for thus it is written by the prophets, and thou Bethlehem, in the land of Judah, are not uh the least among the priests of Judah. Judah, but out of thee shall come a governor, that shall rule my people Israel." And then Herod, when he had privately called the wise men, he inquired of them diligently, notice what time the star should appear. I want to know the very first time you saw the star. That's important to understand exactly when these wise men came on the scene. And he sent them to Bethlehem and said, "Go and search diligently for the young child." He was no longer a baby, but a young child. And when he have found him, bring me word again that I may come and worship him also. That was the biggest lie. He didn't want to worship him. And when they had heard the king, they departed. And lo, the star which they saw in the east went before them till it came and stood over where the young child was. Now notice, every one of us at one time in our life did not know Christ. And there appeared to us a star. Now, the star wasn't in the sky as it was for these uh wise men, but somebody brought us the word. &gt;&gt; Brought us the light because stars just reflect the light of the sun, do they not? &gt;&gt; Some, you know, I I guess have their own light as as they were. But what I'm saying is um God came and he showed us his word and that word led us to Christ. And when they saw the star, they rejoiced with exceeding great joy. And when they were come into the house, they saw the young child with Mary's mother and fowed down and worshiped him. Boy, they meant business. They really worshiped. And when they had opened their treasures, they presented unto him gifts of gold and frankincense and my Alls I can tell you is that these wise men really believed. They really believed. They came prepared. They brought their stuff. They didn't they didn't let a little snow bother them. &gt;&gt; They didn't little heat bother them. They didn't little little sickness bother them. They traveled for two years and they didn't GO BACK &gt;&gt; BECAUSE THEY WANTED to see this king. And when they came, they were prepared. THEY WORSHIPED HIM WITH ALL THEIR HEART AND THEY GAVE GIFTS. &gt;&gt; Of course, when we come to the house of the Lord, we should offer the gift of our praise, &gt;&gt; the gift of our our gratitude and our thanksgiving. And being warned of God in a dream, they should not return to Herod, they departed into their own country another way. how they presented the gifts of gold, frankincense, and my mer. There's obviously great types in there. Now, I didn't have this, but if you could drop down to verse 16 for me, I'd appreciate it. Verse 16, because this is how we know how old uh Jesus or the baby h when the when the um wise men actually got there. And then Herod, when he saw that he was mocked by the wise men, was exceedingly rough and sent forth and slew all the children in Bethlehem. and all and in all the coast thereof from 2 years old and under according to the time. Notice there it is again according to the time which he had diligent inquired of the wise men. In other words, when did you first see the star? Well, it was two years ago. So that's why we know it is impossible for those wise men to be in the nativity scene. [laughter] Micah 5:2 says, "But thou, Bethlehem, though thou be little among thousands of Judah, yet out of thee shall he come forth unto me, that is to be ruler in Israel, whose going forth have been of old and from everlasting." That's just a a a prophecy there. Now the wise men were magi but they were probably priests or astrologers of some sort from the east who recognized the star of Bethlehem. The scripture says there shall come a star out of Jacob. Now these men were learned men. They were scholars. They were gifted. They were signs or dreams interpreters. And they were considered to be wise men. These wise men were walking in the light. When the light shined on them, appeared unto them, they caught it. They recognized it in the scriptures. It was the word for their hour. And they walked in it, and it led them to where Christ was. Now, not all wise men are wise. There are other types of wise men. Consider the man that Pharaoh, king of Egypt, looked up to. The men that actually wi withtood Moses, they were considered wise men as well, &gt;&gt; but they were like magicians and sorcerers. They were gifted as well. They had the ability to use secret arts and they were considered the wise men uh the wisest that Pharaoh actually had. And we know that Egypt had had some smarts because they built the pyramids. &gt;&gt; And so these were the the as it were the those that stood there to to to give insight. And of course we know that um they were not really uh uh they weren't motivated by the wisdom of God even though they were wise men. And so there are two types of wisdom. And I want to talk about that today. We're living in the most evil age in history. It's the most hate. There's the most deception. If there was ever an age that you and I need wisdom, it's in this age. &gt;&gt; Isaiah 33:6 says, "And wisdom and knowledge shall be thy stability." Amen. Of thy times. I love that. Wisdom and knowledge shall be the stability of thy times and strength of salvation. And the fear of the Lord is his treasure. Now, most believers don't know there's two types of wisdom. And if they do, they really don't know the difference. There is the wisdom of God and then there is the wisdom of Satan. The wisdom from heaven and the wisdom of this world. The wisdom that's from heaven is simply peaceable. We sang that song, peace. It's gentle and it never wants to hurt you. That's the wisdom of God. Now, the wisdom of the world, well, there's fighting, there's wrath, there's anger, there's strife, and and it actually the wisdom of this world, it doesn't mind hurting somebody to get what it wants. So, let's remember that not all wise men are wise. As we're going through and we're describing these two, some wise men are absolutely fools. They're ignorant. They're agnostic. They're proud. They're despisers of those that are good. And they will use the wisdom of this world to get what they want. But it'll end up hurting somebody. So let's turn to James chapter 3 verse 13. Who is a wise man and endue with knowledge among you? So how many thinks that you're wise? How many feels you're due with knowledge? What you need to do is show out of a good conversation your works with meekness of wisdom. Meekness. Notice meekness is not fighting and proving and and got to get the point across. Verse 14. But if you have bitter envying and strife in your heart, glory not and lie not against the truth. This wisdom descendeth not from above. But it's earthly. It's central and it's devilish. For where envy and strife is, there is confusion and every evil work. Psalms 19:9 says that the fear of the Lord is clean. It's pure. In other words, it's pure from any kind of strife or fighting or or uncleanness. The wisdom well, we're going to read about it right here. Verse 17. But the wisdom that is from above is first pure. It's pure. In other words, it doesn't have strife. It doesn't have envy. It it it it doesn't uh it isn't bitter. It it doesn't try to uh hurt somebody. &gt;&gt; It's pure and peaceable and gentle and easy to be entreated. It's full of mercy and good fruits without partiality and without hypocrisy. You know, you would think that the wisdom of God was a lot more than that, wouldn't you? [laughter] But that's what it is. &gt;&gt; That's how it's on display. And the fruit of righteousness is sown in peace to them that make peace. All right. So, we got a lot of scriptures and I just want to encourage you say amen all the time and that'll help us because we just we didn't have service last um Wednesday and we're going to cancel this um this Wednesday service as well being uh New Year's Eve with um you know that's probably the most dangerous dangerous night to drive on. It is the most dangerous night to drive on. more accidents. It's just more drunks. It just So, what we want to do is try to get everything we can get out of this service. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Psalms 34:9 says, "Oh, fear the Lord, ye saints, for there is no want to them that fear him. The young lions do lack and suffer hunger, but they that seek the Lord shall not want any good thing. Come ye children, hearken unto me, and I will teach you the fear of the Lord. What make he that uh what what man is he that desireth life, and loveth many days, that he should see good? Keep thy tongue from evil, and thy lips from speaking. Gile, depart from evil, and do good. Seek peace and pursuit. What you can see here is there's the the instruction here of of of David to not use worldly wisdom to get what you want, &gt;&gt; but rather fear the Lord. This is how you get what you need. The wisdom of God is always humble. Not at times Not can be but it is always humble. The wisdom of God. It's not filled with pride. The wisdom of the world is. How could the wisdom of God be ignorant and proud if God despises those that are proud? He even hates a a proud look. So there is no wisdom of God when there's a proud spirit. &gt;&gt; Proverbs 9:10 says, "The fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom, &gt;&gt; and the knowledge of the holy is understanding." The fear of the Lord, it's the beginning of wisdom. Now, um, this fear, it's it's a reverence. It's a deep respect, a feeling of awe and adoration. It's a humble recognition of the divine sacred presence of God's word being first. &gt;&gt; In other words, when you put God's words first in your life that it is when wisdom, the wisdom of God will begin to work in your life. It's hard to have the wisdom of God if you don't respect the word of God. &gt;&gt; Then if if you don't respect the word of God, all you got to do is try to live by the wisdom of the world. I mean, there's wisdom in it, but it's only going to take you so far. And eventually, the wisdom of God will confound the wisdom of the world. &gt;&gt; That's just scriptural. So, we got a lot of scriptures we're going to go through. In Proverbs 15:33, the fear of the Lord, which is the beginning of the wisdom is the instruction of wisdom. And before honor is what? Humility. You're not going to get anywhere without humility. Proverbs 22:4, "By humility and the fear of the Lord are riches and honor and life." Now, how many people go after riches, honor, and life without humility and the fear of God? See, they use the wisdom of the world to do it. Brother Brandon would go on to break down what what the fear of the Lord was for us. And he would say things like, "I could be wrong about how I'm looking at this situation. I I could be wrong. I I I should reconsider the He would say, "The Bible is the absolute, &gt;&gt; not the way I look at it." He said, 'I'd rather have the right spirit and be wrong in my doctrine than to BE SO RIGHT WITH MY DOCTRINE, and I know it, but my spirit is wrong. &gt;&gt; The fear of the Lord is always humble. I could be wrong. Proverbs 1:7, the fear of the Lord is the beginning of knowledge, but fools despise wisdom, instruction. Notice there is that spirit that doesn't respect the word of God. It it it it feels that it knows more than what the Bible says. And the Bible is calling them fools. It's it's really much much easier to use the wisdom of the world to manipulate somebody. It's easier to achieve your agenda without reverencing God's word or the way that God does things. But it will always end up with division, isms, schisms, resentment, confusion, strife, envy. It'll finally lead you to death, the wisdom of the world. There is a way that seemth right unto man, but the end thereof are the ways of death. So it isn't about what we think. We need to stay with the word of God. Proverbs 23:17 says, "Let not thy heart envy sinners, but be thou in the fear of the Lord." Notice this. Well, I got this scripture because it says all the day long. It it's we if we can fear the Lord 100% of the time it's on the forefront well pride won't ever come into our life. But as soon as we we leave the reverencing of the word of God then pride can step in. Now the wisdom of God will take you places that the wisdom of this world doesn't even know how to get there. It'll change your life forever. That's what the wisdom of God will do. Proverbs 10:27, "For the fear of the Lord prolongth days." prolongth days, but the years of the wicked shall be shortened. There's no Look at this. There's no Here's the middle, you know? Here's the middle. It's like you fear the Lord, you're going to live longer. &gt;&gt; Amen. You respect mom and dad, you're going to live longer. You You don't fear the Lord, your days are being shortened. Proverbs 14:26. In the fear of the Lord is strong confidence, and his children shall have a place of refuge. Verse 27, the fear of the Lord is a fountain of life to depart from the snare of death. So the fear of the Lord is a necessary thing for your life. Proverbs 15:16 says, "It's better is a little with the fear of the Lord than great treasures and trouble therewith." So there's, you know, the the the the thing is everybody wants to be rich, right? Everybody wants more, but nobody thinks about the fear of the Lord. And if we just get the fear of the Lord, it's the beginning of wisdom. And I'll tell you, it's going to not only get you riches, but it's going to get you a lot. &gt;&gt; Proverbs 16 verse 6, by mercy and truth is iniquity purged. He's saying white as snow. And by the fear of the Lord, men depart from evil. How important it is to have the fear of the Lord. When a man's ways, verse seven, please the Lord, he maketh even his enemies to be at peace with him. What a promise. You know, you you you you see uh there are are people that seems like they got problems with everybody. And then you see you've got people that they just don't seem to have problems with everybody. Well, what what is that? I mean, to me, the wisdom of God, it's it's pure. It it's gentle. It's it's peaceable. It it it it doesn't try to take advantage. It tries to serve. It gives. And when you got the spirit of God, um you're you're going to be at peace with others. &gt;&gt; And I think this is a promise for for our lives. Amen. All right, Proverbs chapter 8. Now, some of you have been falling behind on the amens. I just I'm up here grading you right now and um &gt;&gt; because we're I figured we'd go through like a midterm test so we can like ace it at the end. &gt;&gt; Okay, Proverbs 8. We're going to read this entire chapter. I love this chapter. I mean, if if if wisdom is important to you, you'll you'll you'll love this word because I could tell you my thoughts, but I really love what the word of God tells me because it's the truth. It says, "Does not wisdom cry and understanding put forth her voice?" So, this whole chapter is wisdom speaking. She standeth in the top of high places, by the way, in the places of the path. She crith at the gates and at the entry of the city and the coming in at the doors. Unto you, oh men, I call, and my voice is to the sons of men. Oh ye simple, understand wisdom, and you fools, be ye of an understanding heart. Hear, for I will speak of excellent things, and the opening of my lips shall be right things. He's just speaking of what wisdom does. For my mouth shall speak truth, and wickedness is an abomination for my lips. In other words, it's not wisdom that would speak um about wrong things. Amen. All the words of my mouth are righteous. There is nothing forward. There's nothing perverse in them. They all they are all plain to him that understandeth and right to them that find knowledge. Receive my instructions, not silver, and knowledge rather than choice gold. For wisdom is better than rubies. And all the things that may be desired cannot be compared to wisdom. &gt;&gt; It's the principle thing. I wisdom dwell with prudence. I see some humility there, don't you? And find out knowledge of witty inventions. The fear of the Lord is to hate evil, to hate pride, to hate arrogancy. That's what the fear of the Lord is. It's to hate those things and the evil way and the froward mouth do I hate. So in other words, wisdom, the spirit of wisdom hates the spirit of pride. Hates it. So just because you can act bigger than me, it doesn't mean anything. [laughter] It would be better. You know, brother Brandon says takes a big man to get underneath another another man. So wisdom is saying counsel is mine and sound wisdom. I am understanding. I have strength. So there's understanding and wisdom. There's there's there's strength and wisdom. By me the kings reign reign and princes decree justice. By me, by wisdom, princes, ruin, nobles, even all the judges of the earth. I love them that love me, and those that seek me early shall find me. The wisdom of God loves those that love wisdom, &gt;&gt; and those that seek me early shall find me. What that means is to seek earnestly. If you look it up, it means painstaking effort. That's what the rich ug uh not the rich young I'm sorry the wise men what they did is they put forth effort painstaking effort to get to to get to Jesus. &gt;&gt; You know sometimes if things aren't easy we we we just we we can't even make effort to get to church. We can't make effort to read a Bible. We can't make effort to pray. &gt;&gt; It's not wisdom. Riches and honor are with me, durable riches and righteousness. My fruit is better than gold, yay, than fine gold, and my revenue than choice silver. I wisdom lead in the way of righteousness in the midst of the paths of judgment, that I may cause those that love me to inherit substance, and I will fill their treasures. I just think about Solomon. The Lord possessed me in the beginning of his way before the works of M. In other words, now we're going to get into where wisdom was at the beginning when when God created everything. The Lord possessed me in the beginning of his way before the works of old. I was set up from everlasting, from the beginning orever the earth was. When there was no depths, I was brought forth. When there was no fountains abound uh uh abounding with water, before the mountains were settled, before the hills was I brought forth. While yet he had not made the earth, nor the fields, nor the highest parts of the dust of the world. When he prepared the heavens, I was there. When he set a compass upon the face of the depth, when he established the clouds above, when he strengthened the the fountains of the deep. When he gave to the sea his decree and the waters should not pass his commandment. When he appointed the foundations of the earth, then I was by him as one brought up with him. I was daily his delight, rejoicing always before him, rejoicing in the habitant parts of the earth, and my delights were with the sons of men. Now therefore hearken unto me, oh children, for blessed are they that keep my ways. Hear instruction and be wise. Hear instruction and be wise and refuse it not. Blessed is the man that heareth me, watches daily at my gates, waitth at the pulse of my doors. Who for whosoever findeth me findeth life, and shall obtain favor in the Lord. that he that sinnth against me wrong, his own soul, and all they that hate me love death. No one would ever say, "I love death." But by default, right? by default when you don't love the word of God. Amen. Proverbs 19:23 says, "For the fear of the Lord tendeth to life, and he that have it shall abide satisfied. He shall not be visited with evil." Wow. It just seems like God holds back great blessings for those who find wisdom. Amen. Now, we don't have time because we don't have time to the whole book is wisdom. But 1 Corinthians chapter 12 mentions that one of the spiritual gifts is the word of wisdom. And uh it may be described as a supernatural insight from the Holy Spirit enabling a believer to apply divine knowledge to a specific situation, solve problems, offer godly counsel, guide others toward God's will, often involving revelation about God's purpose or future events, distinct from worldly wisdom or mere knowledge. So, um, I just want to make this real clear that this morning we are not speaking of the gift of the word of wisdom because gifts and callings are without repentance and God just gives those to whoever he gives them to. &gt;&gt; But we're speaking of a wisdom that we all can attain. The gift of wisdom is not given to everyone. I wish it was. You know, we'd have less problems. &gt;&gt; But God promises wisdom to anyone. Why wouldn't he? The wisdom of God will always direct us to him. &gt;&gt; True north. All right. James 1:5 says, "If any of you lack wisdom, let him ask of God that giveth to all men liberally and upgrade not." In other words, he's no respector of persons, and it shall be given him. &gt;&gt; What a promise. Now, just because God is willing to give wisdom to anyone, uh that doesn't mean there's not requirements. There are there are requirements. It it it's you got to meet the requirements. When Solomon asked for wisdom, God looked at his pure motive. His motive is that he wanted to help God's people follow God. &gt;&gt; I I I need wisdom that I may go in and out amongst thy people. How I need to help them to you. If I'm gonna be king, I need something that's going to help your people uh follow the right way because how will I know? And that TOUCHED GOD SO MUCH. &gt;&gt; It touched his heart so much. &gt;&gt; Because his motive, not because he asked for wisdom, BUT HIS MOTIVE FOR WISDOM, IT WASN'T SELFISH. IT WASN'T SO, YOU KNOW, I WANT WISDOM SO I could get riches. I want wisdom so I CAN HAVE ANOTHER HOUSE. I WANT WISDOM SO I CAN HAVE ANOTHER CAR. I want wisdom to help your people &gt;&gt; that touch God. He said because you asked for that I'll give you that and so much more. Amen. So motive is important. So the number one we must reverence God in order to get I want to say this is number one. We must reverence this word of God if we want wisdom because there's no way that God is ever going to give you the wisdom of of heaven if you don't love his word. &gt;&gt; You you got to put the word first. For the fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom. In other words, you put this Bible above your whole life, &gt;&gt; above your goals, above your plans, above what you want to do. You put the word above that. And that now becomes the beginning of you getting wisdom from above. So, we must respect the word of God. And I don't say just part of the word, but every word. For Jesus said, "Man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word that proceeds out of the mouth of God." We're going to be judged by the word. Wisdom is the word of God. &gt;&gt; So number one, respect God's word if you want the wisdom of God. And the moment that you don't respect God's word is the moment that God will confound you. And I just I just want to go back and look. This same thing happened to Lucifer in Ezekiel chapter 28. Ezekiel 28 verse 12. It says, "Son of man, take up a lamentation upon the king of Tyrus, and say unto him, thus sayeth the Lord God, um, thou sealest up the Sum, now notice this, full of wisdom &gt;&gt; and perfect in beauty." &gt;&gt; So at one time, Lucifer was full of wisdom. &gt;&gt; Now, he was full of the wisdom of God. And he said that thou has been in Eden, the garden of God. Well, we know that was Lucifer, the the beast. Every precious stone was thy covering. The Sardis, topz, diamond, burl, onyx, jasper, sapphire, emerald, carbuncle, and gold. And the workmanship of thy tablets and of thy pipes were prepared in thee in the day that thou was created. Everything God does, he does good. says, "Thou art the anointed cherub that coverth, and I have set thee so. Thou was upon the holy mountain of God. Thou has walked up and down in the midst of the stones of fire, and thou was perfect in all thy ways from the day that thou was created till iniquity." Brother Brandham said iniquity was I don't need to do that. I don't need to do that until I don't need to do that was found in him. It's simple. I don't need to worship. I don't need to praise anymore. I don't need to put my heart in praising God. That's what happened to Lucifer. began to just sit back, kind of contemplate, you know what? I think I want to be my own God. I think I want to do things my way. Now, notice this in verse 16 tells a big story here. By the multitude of thy merchandise, they have filled the midst of thee with violence, and thou has sinned. Therefore, I will cast thee as the prof as profane out of the mountain of God, and I will destroy thee, o covering cherubin from the midst of the stones of fire. Now notice, Satan became a salesman, a peddler, a dealer, a seller of his merchandise. by the multitude of thy merchandise. They have filled the midst of thee with violence. Notice his wisdom now was was was producing strife, anger. &gt;&gt; He was telling the other angels, you really don't have to listen to God. &gt;&gt; And I'm tell I'm telling you, uh Lucifer did not just go to a third of the angels that would follow him. He went to the other twothirds to try to get them. &gt;&gt; But there was a fight. There was a fight in heaven. There was that battle going on. But he was using his wisdom. His wisdom that says you don't have to go God's way. You can have your own will. You don't have to listen to him all day long. How would you like to go have a life and do what you want to do? See, he's a pedler. He was pedalling. He was he was a manipulator. He was just a salesman. And look what happened. Look what his wisdom calls to happen. He had the wisdom of God until he said, "I don't need to to do it anymore." The only thing he could live by was the wisdom of uh we call it now the wisdom of the world, but it was the wisdom of Satan. And it literally destroyed him. He got kicked out of heaven. And he's going to be annihilated one day. Verse 17, thy heart was lifted up because of thy beauty. Thou has corrupted, look thy wisdom that I gave you. Thou has corrupted thy wisdom by a reason of thy brightness. God gives me wisdom. But the moment I think I'm something, it corrupts me. &gt;&gt; My brightness. That's why wisdom is always humble. &gt;&gt; Always. Not part-time. Not once in a while, not in front of others, but it's just humble all the time. I will cast thee to the ground. I will lay thee before kings that they may behold thee. Now, notice this. What happens when we decide that we don't need the wisdom of God? I'm telling you, there's coming hard things, hard things in your life. Thou has defiled thy sanctuaries by the multitude of you don't have to do this. You don't have to do that. You don't you don't you don't need this. You don't need to do that. You know, we got churches. We got so many churches out there to fit your belief. What we want is we just want a church that believes the whole word of God &gt;&gt; from cover to cover. That's what we're looking for. But the churches are just full of it. And by the iniquity of thy traffic, therefore I bring forth a fire from the midst of thee, it shall devour thee, and I will bring thee to ashes upon the earth in the sight of all them that behold thee. Notice, one day they're going to look upon him and say, "Is this the man &gt;&gt; who did all this to the world? Who who weakened the nations?" So the moment that we lose respect for God's word is the moment that God is going to confound us. &gt;&gt; Colossians 2:3 says, "In Christ are hid all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge." In Christ are hid all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge. So number one, respect God's word if you want the wisdom of God and keep respecting God's word. must. Number two, when you seek wisdom, you have to believe that you're going to get it. &gt;&gt; You can't be wishy-washy about it. So, let's continue on in James chapter one. So, if any man lacks wisdom, let him ask of God in verse 6. But let him ask in faith, nothing wavering. For he that waverth uh waverth is like a wave of the sea driven by the wind and is tossed. For let not that man think he shall receive anything of the Lord. A double-minded man is unstable in all his ways. So God would, you know, he he's saying, "I'd rather have you hot or cold." And and if you want to be hot, you want wisdom, believe you're going to get it. &gt;&gt; You know, get get serious. You come to church, believe it. All right. Kind of our opening scripture here. Proverbs chapter 4 verse number five. Get wisdom, get understanding, forget it not, neither decline from the words of my mouth. Forsake her not, and she shall preserve thee. Love her and she shall keep thee. Wisdom is the principle thing. Therefore get wisdom and with all thy getting get understanding. Exalt her and she shall promote thee. She shall bring thee to honor when thou does embrace her. She shall give to thy head an ornament of grace and a crown of glory shall she deliver to thee. The wisdom of God will keep leading you to reverence more of the word of God to know God in a greater way. It will actually cause you to hunger and thirst more for God. And we have that example in Paul. After 33 years, he was still seeking to be more like God. more in his image and more in his likeness. And I I'll say to our youth, and I know that we don't have all of our youth here, but we have we have a couple youth here. And so I'm speak to the couple the youth that we do have. When Jesus was 12 years old, he was in the temple with the doctors of divinity and and and theology. And when he sat there, he heard they that heard Jesus were astonished at what he did say and the answers that he gave. &gt;&gt; And in Luke 2 verse 52 says, "And Jesus increased in wisdom and stature and found favor with God and man." So that tells me that we can have wisdom at any age. Amen. &gt;&gt; And I'll say, you know, try to bypass, you know, getting worldly wisdom and doing it yourself. Go after the wisdom of God. You I've never found a person that had the wisdom of God that ever said to me, "You know what? I really didn't need that. That was a waste of time." Colossians 4:5 says, "Walk in wisdom toward them that are without wisdom, redeeming the time. Let your speech be always noticed with grace, seasoned with salt, that you may know how you ought to answer every man. In other words, not with envy, not with strife, not trying to prove that somebody did something wrong, you know, trying to hang them out, try to make them look bad. That is not the wisdom of God. Colossians 3:14, "And above all these things, put on charity, which is the bond of perfectness, perfectness. And let the peace of God rule in your heart, to which also ye are called in one body, and be ye thankful, and let the word of Christ dwell in you richly in all wisdom." You ever see somebody use the word of God to cut you? They didn't speak it in love. &gt;&gt; If I was to speak the truth in love. &gt;&gt; Uh it's like they want to use the word to hurt you. That's the same thing Satan does, teaching and admonishing one another in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, singing with grace in your heart to the Lord. Paul speaking to the Ephesian church when he remembered to to pray for them. He would say here in Ephesians 1 chapter 1 verse1 17 that the God of our Lord Jesus Christ the father of glory may give unto you the spirit of wisdom and revelation in the knowledge of him. I think that's something that we should pray one for another for. Don't you? the the spirit of wisdom. And when God shines, I'll say this every time we come to church, God is presenting his word to us. And wisdom is to receive it. That word shines in our pathway. And if we receive it, that is wisdom. Sometimes we want wisdom. how to help us in situations, right? Well, I wish I knew how to handle this because, you know, my boss is doing this or my husband's doing this, my wife's doing this, my kids are doing this. I wish I just had wish I had wisdom to deal with this. Well, the way to get that wisdom is when you come to church and you hear the word of God that has nothing to do with your situation. YOU SAY, "LORD, I RECEIVE THAT FROM my life." &gt;&gt; And you grow in wisdom. And then when you need it, it's there. The word of God is the light for our lives. Psalms 119:105, we quote this periodically. The word is a lamp unto my feet and a light to my path. So, we need to take the word into our life and say, I'm going to accept that for me and my house will serve the Lord. I want to read this. Put this up there. Proverbs chapter 6 verse 23. I've never seen it quite like this because a lot of people they don't recognize uh that the commandment says for the commandment is a lamp. The word of God is a lamp. The commandment I command you to do this. That's a lamp. The law is a light and reproofs of instruction are the way of life. Wisdom is the principle thing. Therefore, get wisdom and with all thy getting, get understanding. Let's stand together. God bless you. Now, I will say this. If you would have said, "Amen." You know, more you wouldn't have been so tired. I'm saying that's just wisdom to me. &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's sing. Teach me to number our my days. Our days. That's wisdom, is it not? Teach us to number our day. Oh, teach us to number our days that I our hearts on to wisdom. Lord, teach us to number our days. Teach us to number our days. Teach us to number our days that we may apply our hearts on [music] to wisdom. Lord, teach us to number [singing] our days. [music] Oh, teach us to number our days. Teach us to number our days. [singing] We may apply our hearts on to wisdom. Lord, teach us to number our days. Amen. We only got so I remember as a child I don't think I was quite serving the Lord yet, but I the Lord was probably dealing with me. And I was looking at my dad's life from just like out of the box because sometimes when you're in the box, you can't quite see everything right. I remember looking at my brother and his life out of the box and they were dealing with things that I know that they dealt with a number of times in life and then they were dealing with them again. And I just remember having this thought, I do not want to go this long in life before I learned. &gt;&gt; And I don't know where that thought just came. And it's like my heart just made a decision. I I don't got I only got so many days to live. &gt;&gt; If you're going to get anywhere in life, you need to learn things and you need to grow. &gt;&gt; So teach us to number our days. Amen. Let's sing. Let me be a shining light. &gt;&gt; Let me be a shining light, oh Lord. As the world around me darken, let me be a shining light. Oh Lord, give me strength for each new day. My faith is found a resting place. Oh Lord, it is in your precious word. My faith has found a resting place. Oh Lord, may that anchor always hold. Be a shining light. Oh Lord. As the world around me darken, let me be a shining light. Oh Lord, give me strength for each new day. [singing] My faith has found a resting place. Oh Lord, it is in your precious word. My faith has found a resting place, oh Lord. May that anchor always hold. [singing] &gt;&gt; Amen. Is that your desire? Amen. Let's just look to the Lord in a word of prayer. If we just bow our our heads and close our eyes, maybe there'd be someone here today that would say, "Brother John, would you pray for me that I that I could grow in the wisdom of God?" You want to be remembered in prayer? Amen. Bless these hands. Bless these hearts. Amen. Amen. My hand is up. Remember me as I pray for you. Our heavenly father, Lord, we just bow before you in humbleness of heart, realizing that all wisdom comes from you, Lord. And we submit our lives to you, Lord. We we want to uh consecrate our life to you coming into the new year. And Lord, we all uh desire more wisdom from above. pray that you would fill us with that peaceable, gentle, loving uh wisdom that's from above and and help one another, Lord, to find you. And Lord, when we see our our brothers and our sister sisters overtaken and a fault, help us to restore them, Lord, to use use thy word to to help them to to the place that they need to be. Father, I pray that you take away uh Lord every every ounce of uh pride or uh anything that would be of the wisdom of this world. Just take it from us, Lord. We want to operate by the wisdom from above. &gt;&gt; Lord, bless thy people, Lord, and and give them the very desires of their heart. May they begin to see you manifested in ways in their life that they haven't seen before. And Lord, those that Lord have been walking and in the in wisdom, Lord, I pray that they would begin to see it more manifested in their life. And Lord, uh we know that your elect in this age will not be deceived. Lord, you said that it's the only group of people that won't be deceived. And I pray, Lord, that you just fill us all with wisdom. We love you. We thank you for these things today in Jesus Christ's precious name. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's sing. Shine Jesus. Shine. You can't do it. Can't do that one. Look. Why? Why can't we do it? Why can't we do it? Let's try to do it. Let's just do our best. What do we need to do to do it? Oh, to practice. Okay, we'll give you to next service, honey. &gt;&gt; Okay. All right. Let's sing a Jesus, the light of the world. Amen. We want to walk in the light. Amen. All ye saints of light, proclaim Jesus, the light of the world. Life and mercy in his name. Jesus.
