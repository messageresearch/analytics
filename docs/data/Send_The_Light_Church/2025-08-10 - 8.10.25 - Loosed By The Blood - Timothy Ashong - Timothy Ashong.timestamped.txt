[32:04] He wants to meet you inside your heart.
[32:06] He says I'll meet you there. I'll meet
[32:08] you in that place. And then as he has
[32:10] preeminence in the throne room, he

[37:19] Lord be glorified.

[38:58] his grace. His grace and his grace alone
[39:02] that we are alive. Praise the Lord.
[39:05] Hallelujah.
[39:07] Let us read a portion of the scripture
[39:09] before we sit down from uh the gospel in
[39:12] Luke chapter 13
[39:14] and also read from Revelation chapter 1.
[39:21] Luke chapter 13. And let's read from
[39:23] verse 10. And I want to thank our
[39:26] pastor, brother John, for the
[39:28] opportunity given to me to be here this
[39:31] morning to fellowship with the saints.
[39:33] God bless you, brother John. And uh

[39:44] church. Thank you for coming to church.
[39:46] Re Luke chapter 13, let's read from
[39:48] verse 10.
[39:50] And he was teaching in one of the
[39:54] synagogue on the Sabbath day on the
[39:57] Sabbath.
[39:59] And behold, there was a woman which had
[40:01] the spirit of infirmity 18 years and was
[40:05] bowed together,
[40:07] and could in no wise lift up herself.
[40:13] And when Jesus saw her, he called her to
[40:16] him and said unto her,"Woman,
[40:21] that had loosed from thy infirmity."
[40:26] And he lay his hands on her, and
[40:29] immediately she was made straight and
[40:33] glorify God.
[40:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[40:38] Revelation
[40:43] Revelation 1
[40:52] 5 and 6.
[40:56] and from Jesus Christ
[41:00] who is the faithful witness
[41:05] and the first begotten of the dead
[41:10] and the praise
[41:12] of the kings of the earth.
[41:15] Unto him that loved us and washed
[41:20] us from our sins
[41:23] in his own blood. Amen.
[41:27] &gt;&gt; And have made us kings and priests unto
[41:31] God and his father. To him be glory and
[41:35] dominion forever and ever. Amen.
[41:42] &gt;&gt; May the Lord bless the reading of his
[41:44] holy word. God bless you. Let's be
[41:47] seated.
[41:49] Hallelujah. Praise the Lord. Oh yes, it
[41:53] is good to praise the Lord.
[41:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[41:55] &gt;&gt; And it is always a privilege to be in
[41:58] the house of the Lord.
[41:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[42:00] &gt;&gt; Yeah. And we are here to
[42:03] let the devil know where we belong to.
[42:06] &gt;&gt; Yes. We belong to Christ.
[42:09] &gt;&gt; And we love to come to church.
[42:11] &gt;&gt; Our story is just like the blind man
[42:16] that they say was always holding the
[42:18] Bible.
[42:20] And so they wanted to make found of that
[42:22] blind man. They laugh at him and scoff
[42:24] at him. And this blind man, what are you
[42:26] holding? He said the word of God.
[42:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[42:30] &gt;&gt; The Bible.
[42:32] He said, "But blind man, you cannot read
[42:35] it." He said, "But I believe it."
[42:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[42:39] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. He said, "I believe it from
[42:42] silver to silver." That's from cover to
[42:44] cover. He said, "Because on the cover it
[42:46] is written, Holy Bible."
[42:48] &gt;&gt; Amen. So he said, "I believe it from
[42:51] cover to cover." He said, "Well, I want
[42:53] the devil to know which side I belong
[42:55] to."
[42:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[42:59] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. So it's good. Don't be
[43:00] ashamed to hold a Bible.
[43:04] &gt;&gt; Oh, somebody will No. No. Don't be
[43:06] ashamed of it. Praise the Lord. Hold the
[43:08] Bible.
[43:09] &gt;&gt; Amen. Carry it. Don't be ashamed because
[43:13] to carry it alone is a message.
[43:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[43:18] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. You know I like uh
[43:20] sometime to wear the you know I have my
[43:23] heart with the Jesus scriptures on it
[43:25] and sometime I try to wear tie like this
[43:28] and then just when I was coming and I
[43:31] was coming to Ohio and then I got out of
[43:33] the plane and a man met me he said are
[43:35] you a minister you I said yes I am of
[43:39] course this way saw the tie so he said
[43:42] let's pray
[43:45] we just stood aside said I'm on a
[43:48] mission
[43:48] Commissioner, let's pray. And he just
[43:51] prayed for me. We pray together. And I
[43:53] said, "God bless you. Go ahead." I just
[43:55] left her and I was wearing another tie.
[43:57] The lady said, "Oh, I like your tie."
[44:00] And I wear the cap with Jesus on it. Oh,
[44:04] I like your cap. And I said to myself,
[44:06] if you don't want to hear Jesus, then
[44:09] you read about it.
[44:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[44:11] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[44:11] &gt;&gt; You read on the T.
[44:13] &gt;&gt; I want everything to testify of Jesus
[44:16] Christ.
[44:17] I'm never ashamed of him
[44:19] &gt;&gt; because people put on their cap with all
[44:22] kinds of golf and this and that on it.
[44:24] Why should I be why should I be ashamed?
[44:26] Put put on something with Jesus on it. I
[44:28] would never be ashamed of it.
[44:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[44:31] &gt;&gt; I would never be ashamed of it. If
[44:34] people can wear caps and wear this and
[44:36] all kinds of displays on it and they
[44:39] were freely,
[44:40] &gt;&gt; why should I be afraid? Amen.
[44:43] &gt;&gt; Why should I be ashamed
[44:46] &gt;&gt; to put something with Jesus on it?
[44:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[44:49] &gt;&gt; Because what are we doing? We advertise
[44:52] Christ.
[44:54] &gt;&gt; We are be boss.
[44:56] &gt;&gt; So in every aspect, in every way, every
[44:58] opportunity that we get, we want Jesus
[45:01] to be glorified.
[45:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[45:03] &gt;&gt; Though they might not want to hear it,
[45:05] they might not want to listen, but we
[45:08] become the living Bible.
[45:09] &gt;&gt; Amen. and want every expression of ours
[45:12] to glorify him.
[45:14] &gt;&gt; So saints of God, never be ashamed of
[45:17] the name of Jesus Christ.
[45:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[45:20] &gt;&gt; Don't be ashamed of it.
[45:23] Paul said, "I'm not ashamed of the
[45:24] gospel of Jesus Christ."
[45:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[45:26] &gt;&gt; It is the power of God unto salvation
[45:29] &gt;&gt; to those who believe it. To the Jew, to
[45:31] the Gent, everybody.
[45:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[45:34] &gt;&gt; Oh, we have to exalt him.
[45:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[45:36] &gt;&gt; We have to glorify him. Amen.
[45:38] &gt;&gt; We have to let the word know who what we
[45:42] believe
[45:43] &gt;&gt; and that we love him. We are his
[45:45] representatives on this earth.
[45:48] &gt;&gt; The prophet of God said he has no hands
[45:51] but your hands and my hands.
[45:55] &gt;&gt; No eyes but my eyes and your eyes. No
[45:58] hands, no feet but we are his
[46:01] representatives.
[46:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[46:03] &gt;&gt; So may God help us always when when the
[46:06] opportunity is around. Let us express
[46:08] him. Let somebody know
[46:11] &gt;&gt; when you get to the restaurant to eat,
[46:13] don't be ashamed to pray.
[46:15] &gt;&gt; Thank God for the food he has given you.
[46:17] &gt;&gt; And let them know you are praying. No,
[46:19] because but it's part of our lives.
[46:22] &gt;&gt; That's why Daniel was praying day and
[46:24] night.
[46:25] &gt;&gt; And they knew Daniel prays.
[46:27] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And they give order that
[46:28] nobody should pray. When you want to
[46:30] eat, don't pray. Whatever you want,
[46:32] don't do it. Just your petition, you
[46:35] must ask from the king. Then they say
[46:37] not me. I will pray everywhere. I will
[46:40] pray every time because the Bible says
[46:42] pray with that season.
[46:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[46:46] &gt;&gt; In season and he said pray. Hallelujah.
[46:48] We want to exalt him. We want the word
[46:51] know that we have for Jesus. He has
[46:54] redeem us and we belong to him from time
[46:57] and to eternity. So in everything we do,
[47:00] whatever we find ourselves to be, in the
[47:02] school, in the market, in whatever, in
[47:05] the mosque, everywhere we want them to
[47:07] know, we belong to Jesus.
[47:10] &gt;&gt; Never ashamed of it.
[47:12] &gt;&gt; Oh hallelujah.
[47:14] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord Jesus.
[47:16] &gt;&gt; Woman that are to lose from thy
[47:18] infirmities.
[47:21] &gt;&gt; May the Lord Jesus lose us.
[47:23] &gt;&gt; Amen. from all our infirmities,
[47:26] &gt;&gt; from our thinkings and our ideas,
[47:29] &gt;&gt; from anything that is contrary to the
[47:31] word of the Lord.
[47:33] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. So we read the scripture
[47:35] that Jesus went to the synagogue.
[47:42] He was teaching in one of the synagogue
[47:44] on the Sabbath. So one thing is he start
[47:47] he goes to church
[47:50] after he walk around doing the father's
[47:52] business everywhere he go everywhere he
[47:54] went he was doing good
[47:56] &gt;&gt; oh the mighty healer
[47:58] &gt;&gt; he cleans the lepers he set the captives
[48:01] free oh Jesus said I must be about the
[48:04] father's business
[48:06] &gt;&gt; and he walk here and he go there but he
[48:08] still find time to go to church
[48:12] because God goes to church Amen. Yes.
[48:15] Yes, he does.
[48:16] &gt;&gt; So he went to church. Amen. And it is
[48:19] always a blessing to go to church
[48:21] anyhow. Whether it's winter, whether
[48:23] it's summer, whether it's hot, whether
[48:25] it's cold, it is always a privilege
[48:28] &gt;&gt; to go to church.
[48:30] &gt;&gt; So the scripture tells us not to forsake
[48:33] the assembling of ourselves together.
[48:37] For it is always a privilege. Think
[48:39] about it. A privilege to go to church.
[48:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[48:43] No matter what, it is always a
[48:44] privilege. It is an honor. Oh, to go to
[48:49] church to gather together with men and
[48:52] women of like precious faith.
[48:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[48:57] &gt;&gt; Our faith is precious.
[48:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[49:00] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[49:02] Oh, hallelujah. May the Lord be with us
[49:04] and help us.
[49:05] &gt;&gt; Yes. And so this woman,
[49:10] the Bible said, "And behold, there was a
[49:12] woman which had the spirit of infirmity
[49:15] 18 years and was bowed together and
[49:19] could in no wise lift up herself." So
[49:22] that woman might be in this kind of
[49:24] condition
[49:26] for 18 years.
[49:30] But my joy is that in that condition she
[49:34] was going to church.
[49:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[49:38] &gt;&gt; She could have had
[49:41] excuse
[49:42] &gt;&gt; she could have given an excuse.
[49:45] &gt;&gt; You remember the scripture told and God
[49:47] told them how they should come in God's
[49:51] provided place of worship. How they
[49:54] should come into unto church. how they
[49:56] should bring their sacrifices, where
[49:58] they should enter. But that's the God of
[50:00] Israel.
[50:01] &gt;&gt; He said when you are bringing your
[50:03] sacrifice to me, he specify exactly what
[50:07] sacrifices should be brought to him.
[50:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[50:11] &gt;&gt; How they should bring it.
[50:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[50:13] &gt;&gt; And where they should enter
[50:16] &gt;&gt; that shall not enter into any but pass
[50:19] through this gate.
[50:22] &gt;&gt; Amen. So he shows us the gate and there
[50:24] is just one way.
[50:26] &gt;&gt; I am the way.
[50:28] &gt;&gt; I am the truth. I am the door to the
[50:30] sheepfold. Jesus is the door.
[50:33] &gt;&gt; It is the only gate of entrance.
[50:36] &gt;&gt; It is the provided way of entrance. It
[50:39] is the acceptable way of entrance. And
[50:41] Jesus nobody can come to the father
[50:43] except by me.
[50:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[50:46] &gt;&gt; He is the only way. He is the only truth
[50:49] and he's the only life. Amen.
[50:53] &gt;&gt; So God said, "Enter in through this
[50:55] gate."
[50:57] Hallelujah. There there's one gate that
[51:00] is approved by God. Hallelujah. One
[51:03] gate. No two, not three, no four. There
[51:06] is no salvation given unto anybody
[51:08] except the name of Jesus Christ. No
[51:11] matter your religion, no matter what you
[51:13] think and what you think, there is just
[51:15] one way. Hallelujah. Oh, praise the name
[51:18] of the Lord. What shall we do to be
[51:20] saved on the day of Pentecost? And Peter
[51:22] said, "Repent every one of you and be
[51:24] baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus
[51:27] Christ for the remission of your sins
[51:30] and you shall have the gift of the Holy
[51:32] Ghost for the promises unto you and to
[51:34] your children and to them that are far
[51:37] off and as many as the Lord our God
[51:39] shall call." Hallelujah. That's the only
[51:42] way and that is the name of Jesus
[51:44] Christ.
[51:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[51:48] Praise the Lord.
[51:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[51:51] &gt;&gt; Is only the only way today and forever.
[51:59] &gt;&gt; And so Jesus went to church.
[52:02] So what would be our excuse? Because he
[52:06] goes all over the place. He's just
[52:09] working. He's just preaching. And then
[52:12] on the Sabbath day, he goes to church.
[52:16] And so that's not the first time he went
[52:18] to church. He has been going to church.
[52:20] Or you even remember, we remember the
[52:22] story when they took him to the temple
[52:25] at the age of 12. He was young and they
[52:27] took they went to to church that day and
[52:29] then the parents left him behind.
[52:34] &gt;&gt; They left him behind
[52:36] &gt;&gt; at the church.
[52:37] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[52:38] &gt;&gt; He was not in hurry to leave the church.
[52:41] He was left behind. And they went three
[52:43] days journey and they were and before
[52:46] they came to themselves
[52:48] where is the word?
[52:50] Where is Christ? Oh today many people
[52:53] have made a journey without Christ.
[52:57] &gt;&gt; Sometime we come to church we hear the
[52:58] word of God and we leaving right and go
[53:01] ahead.
[53:02] &gt;&gt; True.
[53:03] &gt;&gt; We hear the word oh that's wonderful but
[53:05] then we leave it right and go back.
[53:12] And they went away and three days after
[53:14] 3 days all they remember where where is
[53:17] he?
[53:19] Where did we leave him? And the Bible
[53:21] said they begin to sort him among the
[53:23] acquaintances
[53:25] among the Methodist and the Anglicans
[53:27] and the denominations and they found and
[53:30] they didn't found him. He was not in the
[53:32] Methodist church. He was not in the
[53:33] Anglican church. He was not in the
[53:35] Baptist church. He was not in the only
[53:37] of these denominations. I said, "Where
[53:39] did we find where where can we find
[53:41] him?" And they went back to where they
[53:44] left him.
[53:47] &gt;&gt; And they found him where they left him.
[53:49] &gt;&gt; And remember, you always find him where
[53:51] you live.
[53:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[53:53] &gt;&gt; He is the word. He never changes.
[53:56] Hallelujah. Oh, and they found him and
[53:59] they said, "Oh son, I and your father,
[54:03] we've sought you with tears." You and
[54:05] who?
[54:07] What did he say?
[54:09] &gt;&gt; He said, "Mary deny the supernatural
[54:12] birth of Christ."
[54:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[54:14] &gt;&gt; Thank God for a prophet.
[54:16] &gt;&gt; Only a prophet can teach that.
[54:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[54:19] &gt;&gt; That's true.
[54:21] &gt;&gt; Mary denied the supernatural birth
[54:24] because now she said Joseph was the
[54:27] father.
[54:29] &gt;&gt; But in the beginning said, she was
[54:31] conceived by the Holy Ghost.
[54:33] &gt;&gt; Right? And now she said, "I and your
[54:35] father sought you with tears." And right
[54:38] there Jesus said,
[54:41] "Must must I not be about my father's
[54:43] business?"
[54:44] &gt;&gt; If Joseph was his father, he would have
[54:46] been at the carpenter shop.
[54:50] &gt;&gt; So the word of God correct error.
[54:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[54:54] &gt;&gt; So Jesus corrected Mary. That's why she
[54:57] cannot be the mother of God.
[55:01] &gt;&gt; He was the word made flesh. Amen.
[55:04] &gt;&gt; Mary was just an incubator.
[55:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[55:07] &gt;&gt; A vessel that God choose to use just
[55:09] like any of us. Hallelujah.
[55:12] &gt;&gt; So Jesus, the word corrected her right
[55:14] there.
[55:16] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. The word is to straighten
[55:18] our thoughts. Amen.
[55:21] &gt;&gt; And so why we come to church is so that
[55:24] the word will straighten our thought
[55:26] &gt;&gt; because brother said people have been
[55:28] taught
[55:29] scripture in a certain way.
[55:34] &gt;&gt; People have been taught scripture in a
[55:35] certain way. So when the messenger comes
[55:37] on the scene, the messenger is to bring
[55:40] their thought back to what God's word
[55:42] is.
[55:43] &gt;&gt; And because the messenger teaches
[55:44] according to the spirit of God, they
[55:46] think that the messenger is rather
[55:48] wrong.
[55:50] But the correct the right and the
[55:53] correct interpretation of the word of
[55:54] the Lord comes to a prophet.
[55:57] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Women that are loosed,
[56:01] we are loosed by the blood of Jesus
[56:03] Christ.
[56:05] &gt;&gt; Amen. But my joy is that this woman in
[56:09] this condition maybe with a stick in her
[56:12] hands she was able to go to church and
[56:15] she had been in that condition for 18
[56:18] years
[56:21] and maybe the devil was telling her are
[56:23] you still going to the synagogue in this
[56:25] condition why don't you just stay
[56:30] you cannot even walk
[56:33] and you've been going there
[56:35] all this years.
[56:38] Oh, where is your Jehovah? The Jehovah
[56:41] who did those things is not the same
[56:42] again.
[56:44] &gt;&gt; Why don't you stay home?
[56:49] &gt;&gt; Don't listen to the lie of the devil.
[56:53] &gt;&gt; That will tell you that days of miracles
[56:55] are over. That would tell try to
[56:58] discourage you. Of it will never
[57:00] encourage you.
[57:04] and he tried to discourage. You've been
[57:05] going to church for long. What has
[57:08] happened to you? You've been giving your
[57:10] sacrifice. You have been offering. You
[57:12] are tithing. You and this happened to
[57:14] you and you are sick
[57:18] and you have been praying and it is
[57:21] nothing is happening.
[57:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[57:24] &gt;&gt; Hey,
[57:25] something is happening.
[57:29] &gt;&gt; Your prayers is being saved over there.
[57:31] Yes sir,
[57:32] &gt;&gt; you are banking it.
[57:33] &gt;&gt; And our prayer come before God as a
[57:35] sweet smiling
[57:36] &gt;&gt; ser.
[57:37] &gt;&gt; He breathe it.
[57:39] &gt;&gt; He's happy when the saints are praying.
[57:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[57:41] &gt;&gt; He enjoy to hear you praying.
[57:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[57:44] &gt;&gt; Oh hallelujah.
[57:46] &gt;&gt; He That's why the angel came to
[57:48] Zachariah and the angel said your prayer
[57:50] has become a memorial.
[57:53] &gt;&gt; God has heard your prayers.
[57:56] &gt;&gt; It has become a memorial. Oh hallelujah.
[57:59] Oh, praise the name of the living God.
[58:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[58:06] &gt;&gt; Don't listen to the devil
[58:09] that tells you it's all in vain.
[58:13] Like I always said, you know,
[58:17] when you have prayed, you have met the
[58:20] requirement of God,
[58:23] then rest assure
[58:25] that God is just testing you.
[58:29] The widow of Zeraphat,
[58:32] that widow pray, that widow pray in the
[58:35] time of famine, in the time of need,
[58:38] when the whole nation was under the
[58:40] wrath of God because they've left the
[58:43] word of God.
[58:46] Remember,
[58:48] there is one thing that causes the
[58:50] Lord's displeasure. That is when we
[58:53] leave his word. And the only thing that
[58:56] will make us to gain his favor is back
[58:59] to the word.
[59:03] &gt;&gt; May God help us. Hallelujah.
[59:06] &gt;&gt; And so God Elijah has spoken the word of
[59:10] the Lord. Elijah has made a decree, a
[59:12] declaration. He said, "There will be no
[59:14] rain, no due till I call for it."
[59:19] &gt;&gt; Till I call for it. No rain, no due.
[59:23] Think about it.
[59:25] a man of light passion. He made a decree
[59:30] &gt;&gt; and God stood right behind it.
[59:32] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[59:32] &gt;&gt; And then God told Elijah, "All right,
[59:34] what I'm going to do here is uh you go
[59:38] to the brook brook sheriff.
[59:40] &gt;&gt; I will be there."
[59:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[59:42] &gt;&gt; And I will take care of you.
[59:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[59:44] &gt;&gt; In fact, the ravens, the bears, they
[59:47] will come and feed you.
[59:49] &gt;&gt; Oh, the bears. Huh? The best. Ah,
[59:55] &gt;&gt; he was free from superersistence.
[59:58] If it was me, well, God said the
[1:00:01] rabbins, rabbins,
[1:00:04] ravens will be feeding me. Oh no, but
[1:00:07] they were God's servants.
[1:00:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:00:09] &gt;&gt; God can use anybody.
[1:00:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:00:12] &gt;&gt; Any time because he's God.
[1:00:15] &gt;&gt; So listen, the gospel comes to free us
[1:00:18] from superstitions.
[1:00:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:00:20] Because you where did they where would
[1:00:22] they get the food from? That's not my
[1:00:24] business.
[1:00:25] &gt;&gt; That was not Elijah's business. God
[1:00:27] said, "I have commanded them."
[1:00:29] &gt;&gt; And they will feed you. Oh, hallelujah.
[1:00:32] He's our God today. He's the same
[1:00:34] yesterday. And he has a way. He knows
[1:00:37] how to take care of his children.
[1:00:39] &gt;&gt; He knows how to provide. He can give you
[1:00:42] a very good doctor, a very good
[1:00:44] physician, a very good surgery, a very
[1:00:46] good surgeon, a very good friend, a very
[1:00:49] good sister. Hallelujah. Because he owns
[1:00:52] the whole word.
[1:00:54] &gt;&gt; Glory to God.
[1:00:58] &gt;&gt; I'm feeling good, man.
[1:01:01] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:01:03] &gt;&gt; Think about it. He knows how to do it.
[1:01:06] &gt;&gt; Trust the Lord.
[1:01:08] &gt;&gt; Amen. No matter the condition, no matter
[1:01:11] the state, no matter the situation, no
[1:01:13] matter what might be happening around
[1:01:14] us, may God help us to trust Jehovah.
[1:01:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:01:20] &gt;&gt; He comes to free us from superstitions.
[1:01:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:01:25] &gt;&gt; From fear, from worry, from doubts.
[1:01:29] &gt;&gt; Oh Jesus, help the church. Amen.
[1:01:32] &gt;&gt; Woman that are freed
[1:01:37] &gt;&gt; I've commanded the reverend and they
[1:01:39] feed you there. And Elijah went there
[1:01:41] and they see that in morning and evening
[1:01:43] they were bringing food to the prophet.
[1:01:47] &gt;&gt; He just bring food. He take it and eat
[1:01:48] it.
[1:01:51] Was not worried about somebody has
[1:01:53] poison me. Where did they get this from?
[1:01:55] That's not his business. God said
[1:01:58] &gt;&gt; God said
[1:01:59] &gt;&gt; I have commanded them you'll be taken
[1:02:02] care of and that's saying God is our God
[1:02:05] today
[1:02:08] &gt;&gt; oh is God
[1:02:10] &gt;&gt; God help us to believe
[1:02:13] &gt;&gt; you know God called Cyrus King Sarah
[1:02:14] said my servant he called Nebuchadnezzar
[1:02:17] my servant is God and Saros had a burden
[1:02:21] and he said look among you Israelites
[1:02:24] who church of God you People of God, who
[1:02:27] among you will go to Jerusalem and build
[1:02:29] a temple for your God? He has commanded
[1:02:32] me, he has laid on my heart to build a
[1:02:34] temple for him.
[1:02:35] &gt;&gt; And who among you is people, we go and
[1:02:38] do the work.
[1:02:39] &gt;&gt; I will make sure you are protected and
[1:02:42] you are taken care of.
[1:02:45] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:02:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:02:48] &gt;&gt; Who among us will surrender. Who among
[1:02:52] us? God's people, we believe. Who among
[1:02:55] us? God's people will take the burden.
[1:02:58] Who among us will give the sacrifice?
[1:03:00] Who among us will give himself? Lord,
[1:03:02] here am I.
[1:03:05] &gt;&gt; Send me Lord I will. I will go.
[1:03:10] Praise the Lord.
[1:03:14] What a mighty God we are serving. Yes,
[1:03:17] &gt;&gt; I've commanded the raven to feed you.
[1:03:20] And he stayed by the brook sheriff and
[1:03:22] he and for you number of months or
[1:03:24] whatever year he was there until the
[1:03:26] water was the water dried up
[1:03:30] because
[1:03:32] &gt;&gt; somebody was praying somewhere.
[1:03:36] &gt;&gt; God could have kept the water running.
[1:03:39] &gt;&gt; He could have kept the water running
[1:03:41] &gt;&gt; and the birds and the revenants will
[1:03:43] continue to feed them. But there was a
[1:03:45] soul some were crying.
[1:03:47] &gt;&gt; There was an elect crying.
[1:03:49] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And God said to Elijah,
[1:03:52] "Okay, now move from here."
[1:03:56] &gt;&gt; Sometime we came to a place we become
[1:03:58] complicent. We become we get used to the
[1:04:01] place.
[1:04:02] &gt;&gt; It it becomes our comfort zone and we
[1:04:04] don't want to leave our comfort zones.
[1:04:06] We are so used to the place and we want
[1:04:08] to stay there. But God leads us one step
[1:04:10] above the the other.
[1:04:12] &gt;&gt; Oh hallelujah. He called Abraham to come
[1:04:14] out of his comfort zone.
[1:04:17] &gt;&gt; Come out from your nation. Come out from
[1:04:19] your kindred. I will show you where to
[1:04:21] go. Leave your comfort zone. And
[1:04:23] sometime he want us to leave our comfort
[1:04:25] zone so that it will show more to us.
[1:04:27] &gt;&gt; That it will reveal more to us. That it
[1:04:29] will take us to higher heights.
[1:04:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:04:38] &gt;&gt; Oh, this is my way of life. This No, no,
[1:04:40] no.
[1:04:43] I want God's ways to be my way.
[1:04:46] &gt;&gt; Let God choose for me.
[1:04:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:04:48] &gt;&gt; Let God lead me.
[1:04:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:04:50] &gt;&gt; Let us say yes to God.
[1:04:54] &gt;&gt; Because he led Abraham. The Bible said
[1:04:58] he didn't know where he was going.
[1:05:00] Cuz he come out
[1:05:03] from your family, from your nation, from
[1:05:05] your kindred. I will show you where to
[1:05:07] go. He didn't know where he was going,
[1:05:10] &gt;&gt; but he obeyed
[1:05:12] &gt;&gt; because he knew it was God.
[1:05:16] &gt;&gt; And when God start a work, he will
[1:05:18] complete it.
[1:05:22] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:05:24] Lord, help us.
[1:05:27] &gt;&gt; And Abraham obeyed and he was following
[1:05:30] one step at a time. One step at a time.
[1:05:34] One step at a time. Let's follow one
[1:05:36] step at a time.
[1:05:41] &gt;&gt; We sing the song. Where he leads me, I
[1:05:43] will follow.
[1:05:46] &gt;&gt; Where he leads me, I will follow. I'll
[1:05:49] go with him.
[1:05:51] I'll go with him. Where he leads, I will
[1:05:54] follow. May God help us
[1:05:57] &gt;&gt; to follow his leadings.
[1:05:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:06:03] He might lead you
[1:06:05] the way you might not want to go.
[1:06:09] &gt;&gt; He might lead you in the way that it
[1:06:11] might make you look stupid or foolish or
[1:06:14] crazy in the in the sight of your
[1:06:17] friends,
[1:06:19] in the eyes of your neighbors or your
[1:06:22] colleagues or your among your your peers
[1:06:24] or your whatever. What are you What are
[1:06:26] you doing?
[1:06:28] What are you doing?
[1:06:32] The mother asked Abraham, "Where are you
[1:06:34] going?" I don't know.
[1:06:39] So why are you going? Because he said,
[1:06:40] "I should go."
[1:06:43] &gt;&gt; He said, "I should leave."
[1:06:45] &gt;&gt; To go to where? I don't know. But he is
[1:06:48] leading. So he will lead me where he
[1:06:52] wants me to be.
[1:06:53] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:06:55] &gt;&gt; And Abraham obeyed. And that's why it
[1:06:57] was imputed unto him for righteousness.
[1:06:59] Amen.
[1:07:01] &gt;&gt; It was accounted unto him for
[1:07:03] righteousness.
[1:07:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:07:05] &gt;&gt; Because when God spoke to him, he
[1:07:06] believe it and he obey.
[1:07:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:07:10] &gt;&gt; Not knowing where he was going, but he
[1:07:13] went
[1:07:16] &gt;&gt; and that's why today is our father, the
[1:07:19] father of the faith.
[1:07:22] &gt;&gt; If the father of the faith was led that
[1:07:24] way, what about the children of Abraham?
[1:07:29] the same way. May God give us grace to
[1:07:33] be like our father, like father, like
[1:07:36] son.
[1:07:40] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Woo. Glory to God.
[1:07:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:07:44] &gt;&gt; And Elijah was going. God said, "I've
[1:07:46] commanded a widow woman to feed you."
[1:07:48] And it was just going and it was just
[1:07:49] going and it was just going and it was
[1:07:51] just going and then went to a place and
[1:07:54] he saw a lady Poor
[1:08:01] woman.

[1:08:08] &gt;&gt; And then a letter saw this woman there,
[1:08:11] old woman of whatever state she was.

[1:08:16] some water to drink?"
[1:08:20] &gt;&gt; Cuz he has to contact the spirit. You
[1:08:22] have to start conversation from
[1:08:24] somewhere.
[1:08:25] The prophecy, I'm trying to contact a
[1:08:27] spirit. He said Jesus spoke to the
[1:08:29] woman. Woman, give me water.
[1:08:31] He was contacting a spirit.
[1:08:34] Was trying to pull into some
[1:08:36] conversation.

[1:10:24] prophet to a woman that was ready to
[1:10:26] die. They have their last meal to eat
[1:10:28] and die.
[1:10:32] &gt;&gt; And the prophet look at it.

[1:13:16] but our help coming from above.
[1:13:21] &gt;&gt; Your help is from above.
[1:13:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:13:23] &gt;&gt; The one that is up there is our help.
[1:13:26] &gt;&gt; Jehovah is our help.
[1:13:28] &gt;&gt; Jehovah is our strength.
[1:13:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:13:30] &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah.
[1:13:33] In that last hour when the last meal was
[1:13:36] about it's almost gone. God came on the
[1:13:38] scene.
[1:13:39] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:13:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:13:42] &gt;&gt; And the oil never finish and the meal
[1:13:45] never finish. And they keep on eating
[1:13:47] and every morning there's something
[1:13:49] there. Every morning give us this day
[1:13:51] our daily bread.
[1:13:54] &gt;&gt; Every morning was providing
[1:13:56] &gt;&gt; and he will continue to provide for us.
[1:13:59] &gt;&gt; He will never leave us to go hungry.
[1:14:01] That's why we have spiritual food in due
[1:14:04] season. That's why he has stored the
[1:14:06] food for us. And every day he provides
[1:14:08] for us.
[1:14:11] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:14:18] &gt;&gt; She was in this condition. I'm glad she
[1:14:21] went to church. One of that day she had
[1:14:23] missed the service.
[1:14:26] Oh, sometime the devil tell you are too
[1:14:29] tired to go to church today. You work so
[1:14:32] much the last week. You work so much in
[1:14:34] the week. You did so much. Yeah, you did
[1:14:37] it. But what about God's own?
[1:14:40] &gt;&gt; Whatever we did in the week. Yeah, I was
[1:14:42] busy throughout the week in the shop, in
[1:14:44] the office, in this and that. God also
[1:14:47] want his own portion.
[1:14:50] &gt;&gt; Why do we give excuse when it come to
[1:14:51] God's time?
[1:14:53] You would not want to lose a day's job
[1:14:56] or you want to miss church service. The
[1:14:58] prophet God said the prophet of God said
[1:15:01] it is good to miss a day's job
[1:15:04] &gt;&gt; and to miss your servicemen.
[1:15:08] &gt;&gt; You can't say amen to that. You're not
[1:15:09] ready for that.
[1:15:15] &gt;&gt; But this check mean so much to you than
[1:15:17] coming to church. And I'm telling you
[1:15:19] the God of Elijah,
[1:15:22] he's still our provider.
[1:15:24] &gt;&gt; Which good thing we try to reason how
[1:15:26] can this be? We are in a different
[1:15:27] world, a modern word here and there. But
[1:15:29] God remains the same God.
[1:15:31] &gt;&gt; The God of Abraham remained the same
[1:15:33] God.
[1:15:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:15:34] &gt;&gt; As long as we continue to use our might
[1:15:36] and our ideas and our feelings, we will
[1:15:38] never see God's glory.
[1:15:47] Like I always said to be
[1:15:50] when he sees you have prayed, you've
[1:15:52] prayed and he sees nothing is coming.
[1:15:55] The devil will tell you, "No, you know
[1:15:57] you are not a good believer. God does
[1:15:59] not care for you." But it's a lie. I
[1:16:02] know he cares.
[1:16:05] &gt;&gt; He cares for me.
[1:16:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:16:07] &gt;&gt; Even if he doesn't come, he's caring for
[1:16:09] us. Why? Because
[1:16:12] when he's silent, like I said, you go to
[1:16:16] school, the teacher instruct us, they
[1:16:18] teach us and they give us lectures and
[1:16:21] they do this and at a point the teacher
[1:16:24] don't speak again. It's quiet. Though he
[1:16:27] might be in the class, but he's quiet.
[1:16:29] When he's quiet, that means you are
[1:16:31] being tested.
[1:16:33] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:16:35] &gt;&gt; When God is quiet, he's testing us.
[1:16:38] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. and you pray say well I
[1:16:40] don't see anything he's testing us
[1:16:43] &gt;&gt; and when there is test no question
[1:16:47] when you are being tested you don't say
[1:16:50] pir I I got a question put your hand
[1:16:52] down
[1:16:54] when there is test there is no
[1:16:55] explanation
[1:16:57] &gt;&gt; can you please quiet
[1:17:01] no explanation
[1:17:03] &gt;&gt; because the explanation has already been
[1:17:04] done
[1:17:05] &gt;&gt; the word has already been declared the
[1:17:08] mind of God has already been declared
[1:17:10] and you'll be tested on every ground.
[1:17:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:17:16] &gt;&gt; And God allows us to be tested.
[1:17:24] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:17:26] Listen, sometimes in life we face
[1:17:28] storms.
[1:17:30] But do you also know that it is not
[1:17:32] every storm that comes to destroy?
[1:17:35] Sometime a storm comes to clear your
[1:17:37] path.
[1:17:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:17:42] &gt;&gt; A storm comes to clear some things out
[1:17:44] of your way.
[1:17:47] Things happen in your life to clear some
[1:17:49] things out of your way. Yes,
[1:17:52] &gt;&gt; that is God Almighty.
[1:17:55] &gt;&gt; Oh, you might not see it that way. It
[1:17:57] might not mean that, but at the end you
[1:18:00] will see that all things work together
[1:18:02] for good
[1:18:03] &gt;&gt; to those who love the Lord.
[1:18:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:18:10] &gt;&gt; Is God. He allowed things to come to
[1:18:13] humble us,
[1:18:14] &gt;&gt; to teach us patience.
[1:18:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:18:17] &gt;&gt; To teach us his way.
[1:18:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:18:20] &gt;&gt; Like I've said, I've said it here
[1:18:21] before. When I was 26 years, so I lost
[1:18:24] my wife. I just married for one year.
[1:18:26] the sister passed away. I was already a
[1:18:29] believer.
[1:18:31] Oh my goodness. It was such shattering,
[1:18:35] heartbreaking.
[1:18:37] This one year
[1:18:40] and
[1:18:41] it was so hard.
[1:18:44] It was so difficult
[1:18:47] was crying.
[1:18:49] And this one thing came to me. God don't
[1:18:53] make mistakes.
[1:18:57] Amen.
[1:18:59] &gt;&gt; God don't make mistakes.
[1:19:02] &gt;&gt; And I said, Lord, if this is your will
[1:19:05] for me, I will serve you. I will still
[1:19:06] serve you. I will save you. And this is
[1:19:10] over 40 years now. I thank God for grace
[1:19:14] and mercy.
[1:19:16] &gt;&gt; He blessed me. I married again. I have
[1:19:19] five children.
[1:19:23] &gt;&gt; It was difficult. And the people say,
[1:19:25] "Oh, this boy will not be able to serve
[1:19:27] God." This and that. And there was a lot
[1:19:29] of superstition because in Africa
[1:19:31] somebody died with she was even
[1:19:33] expecting and I lost both mother and
[1:19:35] child. And they said this will not be
[1:19:37] able to serve the Lord again. This will
[1:19:39] be drinking and smoking. This would be
[1:19:42] this and that and that. But thanks be to
[1:19:44] God.
[1:19:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:19:46] &gt;&gt; My uncle head.
[1:19:51] &gt;&gt; My ankle head.
[1:19:53] I said Lord if this is your will I will
[1:19:55] still save you
[1:19:57] and the enemy said if you married again
[1:19:59] if you don't practice or do some
[1:20:01] superstitious things if you don't do
[1:20:03] this if then if you married again your
[1:20:06] wife will die again
[1:20:09] I said I will not do that I will not go
[1:20:11] no superstition
[1:20:13] &gt;&gt; you have to do this you I said I'm not
[1:20:15] going to do that because the Bible said
[1:20:16] till death we do part
[1:20:18] &gt;&gt; that's what the Bible says that's what I
[1:20:20] believe
[1:20:21] &gt;&gt; and I stood there and the price my front
[1:20:23] left and right you have to do I'm not
[1:20:25] going to do it and I said if my God is
[1:20:28] not able to take care of me I'm ready to
[1:20:31] die
[1:20:32] &gt;&gt; but thank God he has kept me alive
[1:20:36] &gt;&gt; he has kept me alive and he's still
[1:20:38] keeping me he gave me a wife a beautiful
[1:20:41] wife he gave me beautiful children four
[1:20:44] boys and one girl his grace is
[1:20:46] sufficient
[1:20:51] &gt;&gt; he has a purpose to mode our lives
[1:20:54] &gt;&gt; to mold our character
[1:20:56] &gt;&gt; to teach us his way to teach us
[1:20:59] patience.
[1:21:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:21:00] &gt;&gt; Patience is a virtue.
[1:21:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:21:02] &gt;&gt; Abraham waited with patience. Noah
[1:21:05] waited with patience. And you and I, we
[1:21:08] have to wait with patience.
[1:21:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:21:10] &gt;&gt; Until the promise of God is manifested,
[1:21:13] is fulfilled.
[1:21:19] &gt;&gt; Oh, he said, "Why should it be me?
[1:21:22] Why shouldn't it be you? That's my own
[1:21:24] question. Why should it be you?
[1:21:28] Why shouldn't it be you? Do you always
[1:21:31] want to read about Job and Job went
[1:21:33] through this? What about your own story?
[1:21:37] &gt;&gt; And I preach one time I said, "Listen,
[1:21:40] your trial is your testimony."
[1:21:43] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:21:45] &gt;&gt; The trial you go through is your
[1:21:46] testimony.
[1:21:50] &gt;&gt; Job had a trial. Abraham had a trial.
[1:21:52] Moses had a trial. All these trials is
[1:21:54] the testimony that we are feeding on
[1:21:56] today.
[1:21:59] &gt;&gt; And as long as God is still calling, his
[1:22:02] people will have trial.
[1:22:05] Because brother Brown said the more
[1:22:06] loyal you are, the more the test.
[1:22:10] He said if you have a test, you have
[1:22:11] find favor with God.
[1:22:13] &gt;&gt; And God has confidence in you.
[1:22:15] &gt;&gt; And God knows you will stand the test.
[1:22:18] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hey, God knows you will
[1:22:20] stand it.
[1:22:21] &gt;&gt; It might be hard. It might be
[1:22:23] unbearable. But God knows you will stand
[1:22:25] it.
[1:22:26] &gt;&gt; For the Bible says he will not give us
[1:22:28] one trial too much to bear.
[1:22:34] &gt;&gt; Believe the word.
[1:22:35] &gt;&gt; Believe the word.
[1:22:37] &gt;&gt; When we believe, the anointing of the
[1:22:39] word comes upon us.
[1:22:42] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:22:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:22:44] &gt;&gt; Blessed be the name of the Lord.
[1:22:48] Do you love him?
[1:22:50] &gt;&gt; Do you love him?
[1:22:52] &gt;&gt; Give a clap of offering to him.
[1:22:54] Hallelujah.
[1:22:55] &gt;&gt; Jesus. Hallelujah. Woo. Great is Jehovah
[1:22:59] and greatly to be praised.
[1:23:02] &gt;&gt; Woman that are loose from your
[1:23:05] infirmities.
[1:23:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:23:07] &gt;&gt; He came to set the captives free.
[1:23:10] And he saw this woman there
[1:23:15] been like this
[1:23:18] for 18 years in that condition.
[1:23:23] &gt;&gt; And God knew all about it. And God knew
[1:23:27] that day she'll be set free.
[1:23:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:23:30] &gt;&gt; And when he got there, he look
[1:23:34] that loosed.
[1:23:37] To be loose is to be released,
[1:23:41] &gt;&gt; to be unt
[1:23:43] &gt;&gt; to be free,
[1:23:47] &gt;&gt; remember this.
[1:23:49] Sin, unbelief put us into bondage.
[1:23:56] &gt;&gt; What cause sickness? Sin cause it.
[1:24:03] What is that? Unbelief. Sin cause it.
[1:24:06] Doubting of one word of God cause it.
[1:24:09] And if he cause it in the beginning, it
[1:24:11] will always cause it.
[1:24:14] &gt;&gt; God don't want us to doubt his word.
[1:24:18] &gt;&gt; God want us to believe his word.
[1:24:21] &gt;&gt; God wanted to stay with his word. No
[1:24:23] matter how it sounds ridiculous,
[1:24:27] &gt;&gt; he wanted to take him.
[1:24:30] And I read the Bible after the fall.
[1:24:35] Look, the Bible say whatever God created
[1:24:36] in the beginning, God said it was good
[1:24:39] and this is good and that is good and
[1:24:41] that everything was good.
[1:24:44] &gt;&gt; When the four came, God said the earth
[1:24:49] is cursed.
[1:24:51] It will no more bring forth
[1:24:54] the way it's supposed to do again.
[1:24:56] &gt;&gt; And God said it will bring forth tones
[1:24:58] and test us.
[1:25:01] Yes,
[1:25:02] &gt;&gt; that's what God said.
[1:25:04] &gt;&gt; After the fall, the earth will no more
[1:25:08] bring forth the way it's supposed to
[1:25:09] bring forth.
[1:25:10] &gt;&gt; And today, you can see what we are
[1:25:13] eating today is death.
[1:25:15] &gt;&gt; From that day, death set in
[1:25:20] &gt;&gt; when the word was questioned. When the
[1:25:23] word was questioned, they questioned the
[1:25:26] infalliability of God's word.
[1:25:29] Did God really meant it?
[1:25:32] Is this true? What can we do anything
[1:25:35] upon it? What can we do? Can we change
[1:25:37] it? Can we add to it? Can we take
[1:25:40] something from it? It cause death. And
[1:25:43] whenever we inject our thoughts, our
[1:25:46] feelings, our reasons into what God has
[1:25:50] says, it brings us into bondage.
[1:25:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:25:56] &gt;&gt; You become a slave. You are in bondage.
[1:25:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:26:00] &gt;&gt; And that's why we are in the condition
[1:26:02] we are in today. And I read the
[1:26:05] scriptures and I said when Mo Joshua and
[1:26:08] Calb when they went to Kadeshbania and
[1:26:10] they when they said the grapes that they
[1:26:12] caught,
[1:26:15] two of them has to carry it.
[1:26:17] &gt;&gt; Two men carried it.
[1:26:19] &gt;&gt; Two strong men. And I was thinking how
[1:26:21] was it in the garden of Ed? What was the
[1:26:23] size of a mango there? What was the size
[1:26:26] of a papa there? Papa, what was the size
[1:26:28] of this there?
[1:26:31] Original
[1:26:33] before sin came in.
[1:26:36] How was things over there? And ever
[1:26:38] since, look at it. Everything is death.
[1:26:41] Today the ground, the land cannot even
[1:26:44] bring forth unless we fertilize it.
[1:26:47] So all that we are eating today is death
[1:26:50] chemicals
[1:26:52] because they cannot come on. And you
[1:26:53] take it from the saw, you put it down,
[1:26:56] then it goes bad.
[1:26:59] It goes bad.
[1:27:01] But thank God the earth shall be loose
[1:27:04] also.
[1:27:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:27:05] &gt;&gt; Because when man fell the earth,
[1:27:07] everything went down.
[1:27:08] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:27:09] &gt;&gt; That's why the earth is being redeemed
[1:27:11] to the same process by which we are
[1:27:15] redeemed. Water, sanctification, and the
[1:27:18] baptism of the Holy Ghost. The earth is
[1:27:20] going through the same process.
[1:27:22] &gt;&gt; Amen. Because our final dwelling place
[1:27:24] will be on the earth.
[1:27:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:27:26] &gt;&gt; The future home of the heavenly
[1:27:28] bridegroom and the earthly bride is
[1:27:31] here.
[1:27:32] &gt;&gt; And I see I saw a new Jerusalem coming
[1:27:35] down from heaven.
[1:27:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:27:38] &gt;&gt; The former things will no more be
[1:27:40] remembered again.
[1:27:42] &gt;&gt; There will be no more sea.
[1:27:43] &gt;&gt; We will not need a sunlight for the lamp
[1:27:46] of God shall be the light of that city.
[1:27:49] It's a city prepared by God for a
[1:27:52] prepared people.
[1:27:53] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:27:54] &gt;&gt; Oh, praise the name of the Lord. The
[1:27:57] earth shall be redeemed and the redeem
[1:27:59] of the Lord
[1:28:00] &gt;&gt; shall come and dwell on here.
[1:28:03] &gt;&gt; That's why in the days of Noah, God
[1:28:06] baptized the earth with water.
[1:28:08] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:28:10] &gt;&gt; Justification.
[1:28:12] &gt;&gt; In the days of Jesus, he shed his blood
[1:28:14] to sanctify the earth. Right.
[1:28:17] &gt;&gt; The next thing is fire baptism.
[1:28:20] &gt;&gt; Fire baptism. That's why today you hear
[1:28:22] of nuclear weapons.
[1:28:25] &gt;&gt; Nuclear weapons. The whole world is
[1:28:28] raising for nuclear weapons. This one is
[1:28:31] everybody and there are people that have
[1:28:33] it and he's just waiting for one crazy
[1:28:36] man to press a button
[1:28:41] and it will spark a chain of reactions.
[1:28:44] We are there.
[1:28:46] We are there.
[1:28:47] &gt;&gt; Yes sir.
[1:28:48] &gt;&gt; You see nation gathering against Israel.
[1:28:50] You see nations gathering against
[1:28:52] Israel. This one said this one said this
[1:28:54] one said that. But God said I will plant
[1:28:56] them in their land and nobody can remove
[1:28:58] them.
[1:28:59] &gt;&gt; No no no no nation no power. Let them be
[1:29:03] millions of Hamas or Iranians or
[1:29:06] whatever weapons any nation we have.
[1:29:08] Israel will survive it.
[1:29:10] &gt;&gt; Amen. Because Jehovah who fought for
[1:29:12] Israel yesterday years is still fighting
[1:29:14] for Israel today.
[1:29:16] &gt;&gt; Do you know 12 day war Iran war you know
[1:29:20] what the Iranians said after the war?
[1:29:22] They said Israel use otic power. They
[1:29:24] said there was a supernatural power that
[1:29:26] Israel used. Yeah. Not ultis the power
[1:29:30] of God.
[1:29:31] How can a small nation like Israel
[1:29:33] survive fighting seven nations or seven
[1:29:38] different fronts
[1:29:40] more than them? The nations were more
[1:29:43] the people are more than Israel.
[1:29:45] &gt;&gt; More more 10 times or 100 time more than
[1:29:49] Israel.
[1:29:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:29:51] &gt;&gt; They have their weapons. They have their
[1:29:53] weapon. They have their mas.
[1:29:56] They have everything.
[1:29:58] How can Israel survive if it had not
[1:30:00] been Jehovah God?
[1:30:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:30:03] &gt;&gt; They said Israel they said their enemies
[1:30:07] said it that Israel use otic power.
[1:30:11] Today this is current.
[1:30:14] &gt;&gt; Yes. It was the power of Jehovah God.
[1:30:17] &gt;&gt; And if the power of Jehovah God stood
[1:30:19] behind Israel, what about the bride of
[1:30:21] Christ?
[1:30:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:30:22] &gt;&gt; The power of the most high God is behind
[1:30:25] us. Amen.
[1:30:26] &gt;&gt; I will build my church
[1:30:28] &gt;&gt; and the gates of hell shall not prevail
[1:30:30] against him. You will have trials. You
[1:30:32] will have challenges. You have forces
[1:30:34] fighting against you. But they will
[1:30:35] never prevail.
[1:30:36] &gt;&gt; They cannot prevail
[1:30:38] &gt;&gt; because we are chosen by God. We are
[1:30:40] elected by God. And God is defending us.
[1:30:47] &gt;&gt; What did the Bible said?
[1:30:48] &gt;&gt; A th000 will fall at your side. 10,000
[1:30:52] at your right hand, but shall never come
[1:30:54] near you. Amen.
[1:30:55] &gt;&gt; You will see your enemies fall.
[1:30:57] &gt;&gt; Yes sir.
[1:30:58] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Your enemies you will see
[1:31:00] God will raise up people to fight.
[1:31:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:31:03] &gt;&gt; And when they came with all their score
[1:31:04] missiles and we Hey, there were other
[1:31:07] nation fighting for Israel.
[1:31:10] Send their
[1:31:12] air defense systems. Even Jordan was
[1:31:14] doing it. Even Britain, even France,
[1:31:17] they all saying it to defend Israel.
[1:31:19] Yes. I will give you mothers and I will
[1:31:21] give you fathers. Right.
[1:31:25] &gt;&gt; Hey, Bible days are still with us.
[1:31:27] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:31:28] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:31:30] &gt;&gt; This boy is crazy. That's okay. I always
[1:31:32] people always thought I'm crazy, but
[1:31:34] that's okay. I don't worry much about
[1:31:36] what people think. I'm happy when I'm in
[1:31:38] the service of the king.
[1:31:43] &gt;&gt; They say Israel use power.
[1:31:46] It's not otic power. It's Jehovah God.
[1:31:49] Because how can Israel survive if it had
[1:31:52] not been God?
[1:31:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:31:56] &gt;&gt; How can Israel Hey, Israel is the only
[1:31:59] nation that does what no other nation
[1:32:01] does. Even in their battles today,
[1:32:05] only Israel when they are coming to
[1:32:07] fight, they say, "Hey, civilians move
[1:32:10] from here. We are coming to work there."
[1:32:12] &gt;&gt; Russia don't do. Russia has been
[1:32:14] throwing missiles to Ukraine. They don't
[1:32:16] care about who is there, whatever is
[1:32:17] there. But Israel will tell you no move
[1:32:20] from here. Only Israel does that. They
[1:32:23] said listen they thought we cannot go to
[1:32:24] Rafa. We they thought we cannot go here.
[1:32:26] They said don't go to the tanners. Don't
[1:32:28] do this and that. He said we'll do it.
[1:32:30] And we did it.
[1:32:33] Oh, don't attack Iran. Don't do this.
[1:32:35] They said we did it. We will do it. Oh,
[1:32:37] if you do it, I'll be. They've done it.
[1:32:40] Israel have done it.
[1:32:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:32:42] &gt;&gt; Israel have done it.
[1:32:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:32:44] &gt;&gt; What every nation was afraid to do,
[1:32:46] Israel has done it. Amen.
[1:32:48] &gt;&gt; Oh, fear no little flock. It is your
[1:32:51] father's good way to give you the
[1:32:53] kingdom. Hallelujah. Praise the Lord
[1:32:56] Jesus.
[1:32:59] &gt;&gt; Why are looking at me like what is this
[1:33:01] boy talking about here? Yeah. I'm not
[1:33:04] looking at you. I'm looking at God. I'm
[1:33:05] feeling very good. Hallelujah.
[1:33:08] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:33:09] &gt;&gt; Listen, these things are true. These
[1:33:12] things we are is real. For you to know
[1:33:15] that our God is real. Our God is alive
[1:33:17] and Jesus Christ is the same yesterday,
[1:33:20] today and forever.
[1:33:21] &gt;&gt; But the reason is that many of us are
[1:33:23] tied down.
[1:33:25] &gt;&gt; You must be loose.
[1:33:29] &gt;&gt; There was a donkey when Jesus was going
[1:33:31] to Jerusalem. It was tied.
[1:33:34] &gt;&gt; Jesus said to the go and lose that
[1:33:37] donkey
[1:33:39] &gt;&gt; and bring that donkey to me
[1:33:41] &gt;&gt; and I will ride on it. You must be
[1:33:43] untie. And when we untied, he rides on
[1:33:47] us.
[1:33:48] &gt;&gt; We become the donkey. I want to be a
[1:33:50] donkey for Jesus to ride on me. Ride to
[1:33:53] Jerusalem. Ride. Ride. Keep riding. Oh,
[1:33:56] hallelujah. That you'll be a voice, a
[1:33:59] voice to Jesus. A life to Jesus. All
[1:34:02] eyes to Jesus. A a weapon. A an
[1:34:05] instrument.
[1:34:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:34:06] &gt;&gt; But you have to be untied first.
[1:34:09] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:34:10] &gt;&gt; You have to be loose first.
[1:34:12] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:34:13] &gt;&gt; It's a go to that. Lose that donkey.
[1:34:16] If any man ask you why didn't the master
[1:34:20] need it?
[1:34:20] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:34:22] &gt;&gt; We must be loose.
[1:34:23] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:34:24] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Woo. Glor. When Lazarus was
[1:34:27] raised from the dead, he came out with
[1:34:29] his grave clothes on him. Jesus said,
[1:34:32] "Lose him."
[1:34:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:34:34] &gt;&gt; And let him go.
[1:34:39] &gt;&gt; Brother,
[1:34:41] it might be loose.
[1:34:44] and come out of your own ideas.
[1:34:48] &gt;&gt; Loose from superstitions.
[1:34:52] &gt;&gt; The prophet said here,
[1:34:56] "The greatest weapon was ever put in the
[1:34:59] hands of man is the Bible to be backed
[1:35:05] up with the Holy Ghost." that Jesus died
[1:35:08] at Calvary to free his church from
[1:35:13] superstitions
[1:35:15] and fear
[1:35:16] &gt;&gt; and doubts and tremblings.
[1:35:20] He lives today. He rose from the dead.
[1:35:25] He is alive tonight.
[1:35:28] &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah. Yeah. Ye him.
[1:35:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:35:31] &gt;&gt; To lose the church. To free the church
[1:35:33] from superstitions.
[1:35:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:35:36] from fear, from worry, from doubt.
[1:35:42] &gt;&gt; Fear is a curse
[1:35:45] &gt;&gt; because of fear. Ah, he tormented.
[1:35:48] But Christ came. The Bible say he never
[1:35:50] giveth a spirit of fear.
[1:35:51] &gt;&gt; Amen. But they give it a spirit of
[1:35:54] adoption. Spirit of sons and daughters
[1:35:57] that we can cry aba
[1:36:00] father
[1:36:02] &gt;&gt; sons of god free
[1:36:04] &gt;&gt; loose
[1:36:06] &gt;&gt; by the blood of Jesus Christ.
[1:36:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:36:12] &gt;&gt; What the bible says unto him that love
[1:36:15] us and washes
[1:36:18] from our sins. Brother said that word
[1:36:21] wash means to lose.
[1:36:25] Amen.
[1:36:26] Unto him that love us and wash us from
[1:36:28] our sins in his own blood. The word wash
[1:36:32] there actually in the Greek means to
[1:36:35] lose.
[1:36:36] &gt;&gt; He lose us.
[1:36:39] We were tied to the earth by our sin. We
[1:36:43] couldn't see. We couldn't hear. We had
[1:36:46] no conception of heaven. But when the
[1:36:49] blood came down, it cut the line and we
[1:36:54] got loose.
[1:36:57] &gt;&gt; It cut the line.
[1:36:59] &gt;&gt; Lord,
[1:37:01] &gt;&gt; we were tied down
[1:37:03] &gt;&gt; in denominations
[1:37:05] &gt;&gt; with man-made ideas.
[1:37:07] &gt;&gt; We're in fear
[1:37:09] &gt;&gt; just like in the Bible, the blind boy
[1:37:12] born blind for years and Jesus came and
[1:37:17] lose him. Yeah.
[1:37:19] &gt;&gt; And the Pharisees came to his parent, is
[1:37:22] that your son? Yes, he's our son. How
[1:37:25] come that is he? We don't know.
[1:37:29] He's of age. Ask him. He said because
[1:37:31] the Pharisees had warned the people.
[1:37:33] Anybody that would testify that Jesus
[1:37:36] Christ is the same. That Jesus is the
[1:37:38] healer. That Jesus is the savior. That
[1:37:40] Christ is alive. That Jesus is the same
[1:37:42] yesterday. Anybody that will testify
[1:37:44] that that Jesus is the Messiah, we kick
[1:37:45] him out.
[1:37:48] So he asked his parents, "Is that your
[1:37:52] son?" Yes. Yes. So how come there? We
[1:37:55] don't know.
[1:37:57] Yet they knew.
[1:37:58] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:37:59] &gt;&gt; But for fear,
[1:38:00] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:38:01] &gt;&gt; Losing their right in church,
[1:38:03] &gt;&gt; their position in church.
[1:38:06] &gt;&gt; The church don't give eternal life. But
[1:38:09] this is what they have thought that the
[1:38:10] church gives internal. When you leave
[1:38:12] the church, you don't have eternal life.
[1:38:14] Khalich believe they have the eternal
[1:38:16] life. Oh, they preach on purgatory and
[1:38:19] all kinds of nonsense. Thank God for
[1:38:22] Martin Luther.
[1:38:23] He was loose to lose the church.
[1:38:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:38:26] &gt;&gt; The church was tied down. Martin Luther
[1:38:29] said the just shall live by faith and
[1:38:31] the people of God were loose.
[1:38:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:38:34] &gt;&gt; They lose the people. They had freedom.
[1:38:37] &gt;&gt; We are not going to pay no money for
[1:38:39] purgatory. We're not going to The
[1:38:40] purgatory is now. That's where we are
[1:38:42] now. We are purging ourselves.
[1:38:45] Death does not change a man. No amount
[1:38:47] of prayer will change a man after death.
[1:38:50] &gt;&gt; The only thing that will change us today
[1:38:51] is hear the word of the Lord. Hear his
[1:38:54] voice. And when you hear the voice, you
[1:38:56] are loose.
[1:38:57] &gt;&gt; You're free.
[1:38:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:38:59] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:39:01] &gt;&gt; Woo. Glory to God.
[1:39:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:39:03] &gt;&gt; Luther came to loose them. You don't
[1:39:06] have to pay any money. And everybody was
[1:39:08] afraid. Oh, Luther. He say, "Hey, here I
[1:39:11] stand."
[1:39:12] Unless you can convince me by the
[1:39:15] scriptures.
[1:39:17] Yes, stand. I'm not recounting nothing.
[1:39:20] Here I stand on the word.
[1:39:23] The word says so.
[1:39:26] That's what the Bible say. The just
[1:39:28] shall live by faith.
[1:39:29] &gt;&gt; Salvation is not by Roman pope or by any
[1:39:32] pope. No, salvation is by the word.
[1:39:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:39:36] &gt;&gt; We are justified by faith.
[1:39:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:39:39] Not by words.
[1:39:42] &gt;&gt; He was loose
[1:39:45] &gt;&gt; to declare
[1:39:47] the counsel of God. No. When Apostle
[1:39:49] Paul said, "I I I'm not ashamed of the
[1:39:53] gospel of Jesus Christ."
[1:39:56] &gt;&gt; It is the power of God unto salvation.
[1:39:59] &gt;&gt; It's the word that loses us. It's the
[1:40:01] word that sets us free.
[1:40:03] &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah. Hey, today there are
[1:40:05] many people in bondage.
[1:40:09] They cannot help themselves
[1:40:14] today. The men and women in our country
[1:40:18] and everywhere else has sold their self
[1:40:22] onto sin, drinking, gambling, carousing
[1:40:27] and doing things that they ought not to
[1:40:30] do
[1:40:31] &gt;&gt; and become slaves to the devil.
[1:40:35] Brother, I met a lady, a young lady here
[1:40:37] not long ago. She said, "Oh, Brother
[1:40:39] Abraham, I did give everything if I
[1:40:42] could only
[1:40:44] break this band of whiskey from me."
[1:40:50] Bound. People are bound.
[1:40:53] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:40:54] &gt;&gt; Look at all over the people are bound.
[1:40:56] Slash.
[1:40:59] See there.
[1:41:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:41:00] &gt;&gt; See the way they dress. See the way they
[1:41:02] do. See the things they are doing. It's
[1:41:04] unbelievable to think if you have lived
[1:41:07] maybe 20 years back or even 30 years or
[1:41:09] to think that women will come to this
[1:41:11] spot
[1:41:13] that human beings will be living the way
[1:41:16] they are living.
[1:41:17] &gt;&gt; That young men will be dressing the way
[1:41:19] they are dressing.
[1:41:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:41:21] &gt;&gt; In the days of brother Brown preaching
[1:41:22] against things were not like this
[1:41:24] &gt;&gt; right
[1:41:25] &gt;&gt; Brown said the people will go insane
[1:41:28] &gt;&gt; for the coming they will go and the
[1:41:30] people are crazy. They are bound.
[1:41:32] &gt;&gt; They are helpless. Amen.
[1:41:34] &gt;&gt; They can't help themselves. They are
[1:41:36] doing things they don't even know what
[1:41:37] they are doing.
[1:41:38] &gt;&gt; They become slaves to the system. But
[1:41:40] thanks be to God, the blood was shed to
[1:41:44] losers.
[1:41:45] &gt;&gt; Once we were like them. Once we were
[1:41:48] slaves. Once we were in bondage. Once we
[1:41:51] we were sold to denominations. We were
[1:41:53] sold to Christian dogma. My church say
[1:41:56] this. My church say this and we were not
[1:41:58] free. But Jesus shed the blood on the
[1:42:02] cross of Calvary to lose us.
[1:42:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:42:08] &gt;&gt; He said, "Yo, your man, I come that you
[1:42:11] see."
[1:42:13] He said, "A man called Jesus.
[1:42:16] A man called Jesus. A man called Jesus
[1:42:19] made clay and put it over my eyes." And
[1:42:23] he said, "Go and wash your face and see
[1:42:25] &gt;&gt; a man called Jesus."
[1:42:27] &gt;&gt; Have you met that man? Amen.
[1:42:29] &gt;&gt; What did that man did for you? That man
[1:42:31] set me free.
[1:42:32] &gt;&gt; That man lose me. That man delivered me
[1:42:35] from organizations, from Christian
[1:42:37] dogma, from the things of the world,
[1:42:39] from drinking and smoking, from
[1:42:41] womanizing, from all the foolish life.
[1:42:43] That man called Jesus, he set me free.
[1:42:45] He lose me. That same Jesus lose you.
[1:42:48] That same Jesus set us free. That Jesus
[1:42:51] is worthy to be praised. That Jesus is
[1:42:53] worthy to be adored. Oh, hallelujah. And
[1:42:56] they told that man, "Give glory to God.
[1:43:00] This man is s is a sinner. We don't know
[1:43:02] where that Jesus came from." He said,
[1:43:07] "Once I was blind, but now I can see how
[1:43:11] you are hypocrites.
[1:43:13] &gt;&gt; It's a sin the world began.
[1:43:16] Have you seen a man that was born in
[1:43:18] sin? Open the eyes of somebody that was
[1:43:21] born blind. Now I can see the way you
[1:43:23] are. Yes, I can see you. You are
[1:43:27] hypocrites.
[1:43:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:43:30] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:43:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:43:32] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I don't know whether this
[1:43:34] man is a sinner.
[1:43:35] &gt;&gt; Thank God for a prophet.
[1:43:37] &gt;&gt; Thank God for a message.
[1:43:39] &gt;&gt; How can you say William Brown taught?
[1:43:41] How can you tell Brown was a false
[1:43:42] prophet? A man that taught us the will
[1:43:44] of God.
[1:43:45] &gt;&gt; A man that taught us to love Jesus.
[1:43:48] &gt;&gt; A man that taught to esteem the word of
[1:43:49] God above everything.
[1:43:51] &gt;&gt; A man that glorify Jesus. A man that the
[1:43:54] people said this man live Christ.
[1:43:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:43:57] &gt;&gt; He preach and he live it.
[1:43:58] &gt;&gt; Yes, he did.
[1:44:04] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:44:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:44:06] &gt;&gt; I say hallelujah.
[1:44:07] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:44:08] &gt;&gt; Loose. Hallelujah. We are loose by the
[1:44:11] blood.
[1:44:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:44:13] &gt;&gt; Oh, praise the Lord. I don't know what
[1:44:16] the time is, but I'm going to try and
[1:44:19] run up. Praise the Lord. But even even
[1:44:22] if we don't finish, we can stay stay
[1:44:24] here the whole day because I came from
[1:44:25] far.
[1:44:31] &gt;&gt; We've had a whole week for ourselves. If
[1:44:34] we have come here, we must have time for
[1:44:36] Jesus.
[1:44:37] &gt;&gt; People go to the stadium football games.
[1:44:39] How many hours do they spend there?
[1:44:44] &gt;&gt; Sometime they have to get extra extra
[1:44:46] minutes still playing and the people are
[1:44:49] still there.
[1:44:51] We don't want extra time here. We want
[1:44:53] more than that.
[1:44:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:44:57] &gt;&gt; They are not they are not say amen
[1:44:59] again. They're ready to go.
[1:45:04] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:45:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:45:06] &gt;&gt; Maybe we need some extra time.
[1:45:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:45:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:45:08] &gt;&gt; You know that they shoot penalty, they
[1:45:10] play the 90 minutes, they play extra
[1:45:13] time and then when there's no winner,
[1:45:15] they go for penalty shoot. Yes sir.
[1:45:17] Amen. So sometime we can go that way.
[1:45:21] Amen. They are quiet again.
[1:45:25] Don't worry. I'm not going to keep you.
[1:45:27] But what I'm saying that you are loose.
[1:45:30] &gt;&gt; God loses us.
[1:45:32] &gt;&gt; That God will have the preeminence in
[1:45:34] our lives.
[1:45:35] &gt;&gt; That we give God honor. That we be
[1:45:38] flexible in the hands of the Lord.
[1:45:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:45:41] &gt;&gt; That we can Lord not my way. Let our way
[1:45:43] be done. Lord guide me.
[1:45:45] &gt;&gt; Sometime we we limit the most high God.
[1:45:47] Amen.
[1:45:48] &gt;&gt; We we giving a program and Lord, we want
[1:45:51] you to stay this way. And so after
[1:45:56] let him lead us,
[1:45:58] &gt;&gt; let him guide us. Let him go
[1:46:03] and let us follow him.
[1:46:08] &gt;&gt; People are bound today. They cannot help
[1:46:11] themselves.
[1:46:13] &gt;&gt; See the women cut their hair.
[1:46:17] She didn't wear pants.
[1:46:19] She didn't paint their faces. Sometime
[1:46:21] in the play before they play, every
[1:46:24] woman said, "What is that?" The people
[1:46:27] cannot help themselves.
[1:46:30] They cannot. They are bound. The men
[1:46:32] drinking and smoking and and walking
[1:46:34] naked. Everybody is naked. So I got to
[1:46:36] be naked. What's that?
[1:46:38] &gt;&gt; They are bound.
[1:46:40] See grace upon us.
[1:46:43] We are just like them. They are just
[1:46:44] like us. But what is the difference?
[1:46:46] Christ lose us.
[1:46:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:46:49] &gt;&gt; Christ freed us.
[1:46:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:46:52] &gt;&gt; We are free. Free to think for
[1:46:55] ourselves.
[1:46:59] &gt;&gt; He loses.
[1:47:03] &gt;&gt; I'm loose. That's why I'm standing like
[1:47:05] this.
[1:47:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:47:11] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:47:13] &gt;&gt; Oh my goodness. The prophet said, "Unto
[1:47:16] him that love us and wash from our sins
[1:47:18] in his own blood." Oh, you remember he
[1:47:21] told a story about the crow, Johnny
[1:47:24] Crow, he said, "And the crow was caught
[1:47:27] by a man because they were running
[1:47:29] around the field and eating and wasting
[1:47:31] the crops in the farm." And then what?
[1:47:34] He caught one. The farmer caught one and
[1:47:36] tied.
[1:47:37] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:47:39] &gt;&gt; Stay here.
[1:47:41] And he stayed there and he just
[1:47:48] hopping around here and there. And so
[1:47:50] somebody came in. He said, "Sir, this
[1:47:52] crow is a crow. You know, the only way
[1:47:55] he eat is by this. So please let the
[1:47:58] crow go."
[1:48:00] And so the good man spoke on behalf of
[1:48:03] the crow. And the crow was loose. It cut
[1:48:06] the line.
[1:48:08] &gt;&gt; But it stay so long.
[1:48:10] In that condition
[1:48:15] days of miracles are over. God cannot do
[1:48:17] it again.
[1:48:19] &gt;&gt; Denomination is everything.
[1:48:21] And other crows came
[1:48:25] winter is coming. Let's go.
[1:48:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:48:28] &gt;&gt; I cannot go. I'm tired. He said, "No,
[1:48:31] you're loose." The good man Jesus came
[1:48:34] to lose us.
[1:48:35] &gt;&gt; Yes. When we're tied down by
[1:48:37] denominations and traditions and
[1:48:39] superstitions and churchianity, church
[1:48:41] spirit and Christian dogma,
[1:48:45] we could not help ourselves.
[1:48:47] &gt;&gt; We were slave. We were driven to the
[1:48:49] drunken bars and drink and and the woman
[1:48:51] dressing and we were all doing those
[1:48:53] things. But one day the good man caught
[1:48:56] the rope.
[1:48:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:48:58] &gt;&gt; Jesus caught the rope on Calvary. The
[1:49:01] rope was caught.
[1:49:03] &gt;&gt; Say you can be free.
[1:49:06] Just like Israel when golad had them in
[1:49:10] bondage, David came and cut the rope.
[1:49:12] Come on.
[1:49:14] &gt;&gt; What they thought would never be done.
[1:49:16] When the rope was cut when David slain
[1:49:19] golat, all those men became free.
[1:49:22] &gt;&gt; They were free from fear.
[1:49:24] &gt;&gt; They were free from worry.
[1:49:26] &gt;&gt; They were free from doubt.
[1:49:27] &gt;&gt; Now they know all things are possible.
[1:49:30] &gt;&gt; Now they know it can be done. And the
[1:49:32] Bible said all the men of Israel that
[1:49:35] were afraid before they went after the
[1:49:37] Philistines, they went after their
[1:49:38] enemies. Oh, they took their sticks.
[1:49:41] They took their whatever. They ran after
[1:49:43] the Philistines and they slaughtered
[1:49:45] them.
[1:49:46] &gt;&gt; Why? Because they were loose from fear.
[1:49:50] &gt;&gt; Jesus losers.
[1:49:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:49:52] &gt;&gt; Let me say this to you. You are loose
[1:49:55] &gt;&gt; by the blood.
[1:49:58] mist when Jesus died on Calvary he said
[1:50:02] it is finished
[1:50:04] he paid that price every human being was
[1:50:07] loosed there but remember every human
[1:50:10] being was given a pardon but a pardon is
[1:50:12] not a pardon until you accept it
[1:50:15] &gt;&gt; we were not saved yesterday or 10 years
[1:50:17] or because brother Brank no we were
[1:50:19] saved before the foundation of the word
[1:50:22] &gt;&gt; Christ came in to lose us in our day
[1:50:25] &gt;&gt; with the message of the hour the gospel
[1:50:27] came to lose us.
[1:50:35] &gt;&gt; Is for us to accept the pattern that was
[1:50:37] given.
[1:50:38] &gt;&gt; Covering made a declaration.
[1:50:41] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. We were loosed by the blood.
[1:50:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:50:45] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:50:46] &gt;&gt; Listen. Let me try to read this. Get out
[1:50:48] of your way. Oh my goodness. Loose from
[1:50:52] our sins in his own blood. Isn't that
[1:50:56] wonderful? But are you spiritual minded?
[1:50:59] Did you catch it? It was his own blood
[1:51:01] that lose us completely from our sins.
[1:51:05] Take note of that. Completely.
[1:51:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:51:08] &gt;&gt; The blood lose us completely.
[1:51:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:51:11] &gt;&gt; From our sins.
[1:51:12] &gt;&gt; He that is born of God sinnth not.
[1:51:15] &gt;&gt; It cannot sin.
[1:51:17] &gt;&gt; Because the seed of God remainth in him.
[1:51:21] &gt;&gt; You cannot disbelieve the word of God.
[1:51:23] &gt;&gt; The devil is a liar.
[1:51:25] &gt;&gt; We have been loose.
[1:51:27] from unbelief.
[1:51:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:51:31] &gt;&gt; Listening,
[1:51:33] you have to accept the word of God.
[1:51:37] We have to accept what God says. You
[1:51:40] have to leave your ideas and your
[1:51:42] thinking.
[1:51:45] When God lose us, he lose us from our
[1:51:47] reasons so that we can take the word.
[1:51:50] Listen, listen, church.
[1:51:52] The word comes to correct error. the
[1:51:55] world come to teach us. It is not what
[1:51:57] American government or any government
[1:51:59] Africa says is right that is right.
[1:52:02] &gt;&gt; It is what the Bible say is right.
[1:52:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:52:05] &gt;&gt; It's not whatever Americans we have this
[1:52:07] right. African we have this. No, it's
[1:52:09] not like that. It is what the Bible say
[1:52:12] that is right.
[1:52:13] &gt;&gt; And that's why God sends his profit.
[1:52:16] &gt;&gt; So that our mind will be corrected.
[1:52:18] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:52:20] &gt;&gt; That's what the word of God is. So when
[1:52:22] we hear the word it means if our
[1:52:24] thoughts and our ideas are contrary to
[1:52:26] what God says we have to drop our ideas
[1:52:30] &gt;&gt; because the word come to set us free.
[1:52:32] &gt;&gt; Oh this is right. The Bible say what you
[1:52:34] think is right is wrong.
[1:52:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:52:36] &gt;&gt; What the Bible says is wrong is wrong.
[1:52:40] &gt;&gt; No matter how it has been done in years
[1:52:41] for many years it's wrong. Yes sir.
[1:52:44] &gt;&gt; Oh I don't see anything wrong with it.
[1:52:45] You don't see anything wrong with it.
[1:52:47] But the Bible say it is wrong.
[1:52:49] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:52:53] Amen. Are we together?
[1:52:55] &gt;&gt; Oh yeah. Oh woman preacher and woman too
[1:52:58] can preach. A woman can do this. Bible
[1:53:00] say it is wrong.
[1:53:02] &gt;&gt; I suffer not a woman to teach
[1:53:04] &gt;&gt; not to assure authority. That's the
[1:53:06] Bible. Oh but when the woman preach this
[1:53:08] and that sign Bible say is wrong.
[1:53:11] &gt;&gt; So it is not what you say is right. It
[1:53:13] is what the Bible say is right. Amen.
[1:53:15] &gt;&gt; That's why God rejected the sacrifice of
[1:53:17] Cain. And God told Cain, don't you see
[1:53:20] what Abel has done?
[1:53:22] &gt;&gt; Forsake your way and take the will of
[1:53:24] God.
[1:53:26] &gt;&gt; That's why God came to lose us.
[1:53:30] &gt;&gt; That we can think for ourselves.
[1:53:32] &gt;&gt; That we can see heavy. That we can see
[1:53:34] the word
[1:53:36] &gt;&gt; that we can live by the word.
[1:53:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:53:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:53:43] Listen. Did you catch it? It was his own
[1:53:46] blood that lose us completely from our
[1:53:48] sins. It was not human blood. It was the
[1:53:51] blood of God. Peter called it the blood
[1:53:53] of Christ. Paul called it the blood of
[1:53:56] the Lord and the blood of Jesus. Not
[1:53:58] three person but one person. There is
[1:54:01] that revelation again. One God that
[1:54:04] omnipotent Jehovah came down and made
[1:54:06] himself a body by the revel by the means
[1:54:09] of the virgin birth and end it that it
[1:54:12] might be the blood of God that will free
[1:54:15] us, lose us entirely from our sins and
[1:54:21] present us spotless before himself
[1:54:24] &gt;&gt; with exceedingly great joy. Will you
[1:54:27] like an Old Testament type? Let us go
[1:54:30] back to the Garden of Eden. When the
[1:54:32] first news came to glory that the son
[1:54:36] Adam had fall had had been lost. Did God
[1:54:39] send an angel? Did he send a son? Did he
[1:54:43] send another one like unto us? No. He
[1:54:47] came in safe
[1:54:48] &gt;&gt; to redeem that
[1:54:51] that lost son. Hallelujah. Did God not
[1:54:54] ent he said God did not entrust
[1:54:57] his plan of salvation to another? He
[1:55:00] trusted only himself.
[1:55:02] &gt;&gt; God was made flesh and dwelt among us
[1:55:05] and redeemed us unto himself.
[1:55:08] &gt;&gt; We are saved by the blood of God.
[1:55:10] &gt;&gt; The eternal God in dwelt a mortal body
[1:55:13] in order to take away sin. He became the
[1:55:16] lamb in order to shed his blood and
[1:55:19] enter into the into the veil with it.
[1:55:23] Consider this. Take note. Consider this.
[1:55:26] The prophet said, "Consider this. Since
[1:55:28] it is the blood of God,
[1:55:31] it is perfect blood.
[1:55:33] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:55:34] &gt;&gt; And if the perfect blood is loosening us
[1:55:36] from the power and bondage and
[1:55:38] definement of sin, then the loosening is
[1:55:42] perfect
[1:55:43] &gt;&gt; and complete.
[1:55:44] &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah.
[1:55:46] &gt;&gt; The loosening is perfect and complete.
[1:55:52] &gt;&gt; There is now therefore no condemnation.
[1:55:54] Who shall lay anything to the child of
[1:55:56] God's elect? It is God that justifith,
[1:55:59] declares us righteous.
[1:56:02] &gt;&gt; Who is he that condemnth? It is Christ
[1:56:04] that died. Romans 3, Romans 8:33, 334.
[1:56:08] &gt;&gt; There it is. The death, his death gave
[1:56:12] us the blood. The blood has lose us.
[1:56:16] There is now therefore no condemnation.
[1:56:19] How can there be? There is nothing to be
[1:56:22] condemned for because the blood has
[1:56:26] loosed us from sin. We are free.
[1:56:30] Guiltless. Don't listen to man. Listen
[1:56:34] to the word.
[1:56:36] &gt;&gt; Listen to the word. The word says you
[1:56:38] are free.
[1:56:39] &gt;&gt; The word say you are guiltless. He that
[1:56:41] believe on the Lord is free from sin.
[1:56:44] Free from the power of Satan.
[1:56:46] &gt;&gt; We are free. We are loose.
[1:56:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:56:49] &gt;&gt; Oh hallelujah. Christian dogma has no
[1:56:52] dominion over us.
[1:56:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:56:53] &gt;&gt; Traditions of men has no dominion over
[1:56:55] us.
[1:56:56] &gt;&gt; No church, religion has dominion over
[1:56:58] us. No denomination, no organization.
[1:57:01] &gt;&gt; No pope, nothing. Because the son of God
[1:57:05] has made us free.
[1:57:06] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:57:10] &gt;&gt; Don't listen to man. Listen to the word.
[1:57:14] &gt;&gt; Don't listen to your feelings, your
[1:57:16] reason. Don't depend on that. depend on
[1:57:19] the word.
[1:57:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:57:21] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:57:22] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:57:23] &gt;&gt; Hey, he said here, don't listen to man.
[1:57:26] Listen to the word. You are loose by the
[1:57:29] blood. Now, don't get tied down again by
[1:57:32] traditions and Christian organizations.
[1:57:35] Don't be led astray by listening to
[1:57:38] those that deny the power of the word of
[1:57:40] God and deny that Jesus Christ saves his
[1:57:42] and fills with the Holy Ghost and power.
[1:57:46] You are God's free man. God's free men.
[1:57:50] God's free men. Lose by his own blood.
[1:57:54] If we still hold your faith to Christian
[1:57:56] dogmas, it is certain by the evidence
[1:58:00] that you have lost your faith in the
[1:58:03] word of God.
[1:58:04] &gt;&gt; Don't lose your faith in the word of
[1:58:06] God.
[1:58:07] &gt;&gt; God be with us. Church woman that lose.
[1:58:12] &gt;&gt; He lose the church. He lose us from
[1:58:15] worry, from fear, from superstition,
[1:58:19] from doubt. We are free. Listen, don't
[1:58:22] let the devil torment you with death.
[1:58:23] You are going to die. No. If I die, you
[1:58:25] know, you know, a Christian don't die.
[1:58:28] &gt;&gt; Christian never dies. Christians only
[1:58:31] say goodbye.
[1:58:32] &gt;&gt; Christians only fall asleep. We will
[1:58:35] leave here for the new place.
[1:58:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:58:37] &gt;&gt; We have if this earthly tac tabernacle
[1:58:40] is destroyed, we have one already.
[1:58:42] Christians don't our loved ones that
[1:58:43] have gone they are not dead they are
[1:58:45] waiting for us
[1:58:47] &gt;&gt; so don't let the devil torment us we
[1:58:49] lose us from fear you lose from from
[1:58:52] superstitions we are free
[1:58:54] &gt;&gt; amen
[1:58:54] &gt;&gt; I'm telling you maybe you don't here you
[1:58:56] don't know what about superstition but
[1:58:58] you talk about Africa there's a lot of
[1:58:59] superstitions
[1:59:01] &gt;&gt; I'm telling there's a lot of
[1:59:02] superstitions
[1:59:04] &gt;&gt; if you hold on to that you will never
[1:59:06] make it
[1:59:07] &gt;&gt; I'm telling you like I said when I lost
[1:59:10] my super position. Don't do this. You
[1:59:13] don't have to sleep on your bed because
[1:59:15] when you sleep on your bed, your wife
[1:59:17] will come and lie by you or your husband
[1:59:18] will come and lie by you and they have
[1:59:20] to do this and that. I said, "I'm not
[1:59:21] going to doing nothing."
[1:59:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:59:24] &gt;&gt; And they speak and my father was
[1:59:26] speaking my ah they said no no no my
[1:59:29] father you have to listen to me. I said
[1:59:30] no I have to listen to the word of God.
[1:59:33] &gt;&gt; I was 26 years old and all this was
[1:59:36] being bombarded left and right. Do this.
[1:59:38] Now I said the Bible said the Bible says
[1:59:40] till death will do part. I don't I'm not
[1:59:42] going to do anything. No. If you don't
[1:59:44] do it and the spirit will come and lie.
[1:59:47] I said let her come. My wife I love her.
[1:59:49] If she want to come she should come. You
[1:59:51] have to dismantle your bed. As I'm not
[1:59:52] going to dismantle my bed. I will sleep
[1:59:53] on that same bed.
[1:59:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:59:58] No. My father said I am your father. You
[2:00:01] have to listen to me. I am the head of
[2:00:02] the family. I said hey you are the head
[2:00:05] of the family. I'm also head in my
[2:00:06] church.
[2:00:08] Why do you want me to listen to you?
[2:00:10] Well, if you don't listen, you will die.
[2:00:12] Say, then let me die. If my God that I'm
[2:00:15] serving is not able to protect me, let
[2:00:18] me die.
[2:00:20] &gt;&gt; I'm ready to go.
[2:00:23] And until God has finished with us,
[2:00:25] nothing can take us.
[2:00:27] &gt;&gt; We lose. You are loose from fear. You
[2:00:31] are loose from worrying.
[2:00:34] Why do we worry? He said which of us by
[2:00:36] worrying can add one inch to our earth.
[2:00:40] He said if we cannot do that which is
[2:00:42] list why do we worry ourselves? He said
[2:00:44] there is no victory in worrying.
[2:00:48] All the power is in faith.
[2:00:50] &gt;&gt; So have faith in God.
[2:00:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:00:54] &gt;&gt; You are loose to believe God
[2:00:57] &gt;&gt; to stay with the word of God. Don't
[2:00:59] worry. You are free from superstition.
[2:01:01] God is real. God is alive. This is not
[2:01:04] feeble. This is true.
[2:01:07] &gt;&gt; Listen. Cast your cares upon me
[2:01:11] &gt;&gt; for he
[2:01:13] &gt;&gt; my brother. Cast your care upon me.
[2:01:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:01:16] &gt;&gt; Church, cast your care upon.
[2:01:19] &gt;&gt; If we have anything to do is pray and
[2:01:22] commit it into the hands of the Lord.
[2:01:25] &gt;&gt; That is the greatest thing we can do.
[2:01:27] Lord, I don't know what to do about
[2:01:29] this, but I leave it in your care. I
[2:01:31] know you know how to do it. I will get
[2:01:34] over here. You are the one that will do
[2:01:35] it. When they made the Red Sea, they
[2:01:38] didn't know what to do, but he know what
[2:01:40] to do. Don't worry.
[2:01:43] Divide it. Go. He knows. So why do we
[2:01:46] worry? Why are we taking things from his
[2:01:49] hands? Leave it into his hands.
[2:01:53] The God of Israel has to lose us by the
[2:01:57] blood of Jesus.
[2:01:59] &gt;&gt; We are free. Completely free. completely
[2:02:03] free. Free to believe the gospel. Free
[2:02:06] to dress right. Free to live right. Free
[2:02:09] to speak right. Free to walk right. Free
[2:02:12] to glorify him. Free to praise him. Free
[2:02:15] to worship him. You are loose.
[2:02:19] Woman, you are loose. Church, you are
[2:02:22] loose. Young men, we are loose. Young
[2:02:26] women, we are loose. Saints, we are

[2:02:34] [Applause]
[2:02:52] &gt;&gt; How many?
[2:02:54] Let's stand together.
[2:03:10] I wonder if there just be anybody here
[2:03:11] today that feels that there's still
[2:03:14] something hanging on.
[2:03:17] I mean, we heard a word to set us free.
[2:03:21] Maybe we're hanging on to some pride.
[2:03:26] maybe hanging on to some
[2:03:30] some things that we know that shouldn't
[2:03:32] be in our life.
[2:03:34] There's no better place to be set free
[2:03:37] than God's house.
[2:03:40] &gt;&gt; We heard a word,
[2:03:43] a complete word. We didn't hear half a
[2:03:45] word.
[2:03:48] We heard a word that
[2:03:51] can set us all free from no matter what
[2:03:54] it is.
[2:03:56] And I want to invite you to just come
[2:04:01] and be serious with the Lord. Just take
[2:04:04] the step, one step towards the Lord and
[2:04:08] he'll draw close to you and whatever you
[2:04:11] have need of. I believe that God is a
[2:04:13] able to make that word that we heard
[2:04:15] today become real for you. Amen.
[2:04:19] &gt;&gt; So, as our brother said that your life,
[2:04:21] what you're going through, what happened
[2:04:23] can be your testimony.
[2:04:25] Amen. Let's sing in the name uh of
[2:04:29] Jesus.

[2:04:35] of Jesus.
