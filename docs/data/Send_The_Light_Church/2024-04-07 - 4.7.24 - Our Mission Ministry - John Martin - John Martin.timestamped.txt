[21:13] in this late hour in Jesus name we ask
[21:16] it amen you may be seated amen we have a
[21:20] testimony um brother Jonathan you want
[21:23] to give
[21:26] that so uh many of you know know that
[21:29] last Wednesday um while we were in
[21:31] service praying um I got a text um that
[21:36] my aunt Cheryl was uh had already passed
[21:39] away and been revived and she was asking
[21:42] for any and all family that wanted to
[21:44] see her to um come to Florida so me and
[21:48] my sisters jumped on a plane and went to
[21:50] to Florida the good news is many of you
[21:53] know that 14 days prior she accepted
[21:56] Jesus as her Lord and savior
[22:00] first aspect of the testimony is they
[22:02] kept asking her if she wanted morphine
[22:05] and what not to deal with the pain um
[22:07] her spine was disintegrated in literally
[22:10] a month her her spine crumbled and and
[22:14] disintegrated um she said no I'm fine
[22:16] and she was literally up until the
[22:18] minutes before she passed away she was
[22:20] joking and my aunt and other people said
[22:24] that can only be God literally she the
[22:27] pain that anybody else would be going
[22:29] through with their organs shutting down
[22:31] and their bones crumbling inside of them
[22:34] would be in such excruciating pain and
[22:36] she just kept telling the nurses and
[22:38] doctors no I'm fine and uh so the peace
[22:41] that was with her and uh you know
[22:43] another testimony my Uncle Ronnie's
[22:45] still not there so keep praying for for
[22:47] his soul but um he did say the day
[22:51] before she passed if you all remember
[22:53] last year my other aunt got cured of the
[22:55] same cancer that is uncurable there is
[22:59] no cure for this cancer and uh she was
[23:03] taking some medications and lots of
[23:06] prayer and uh well got healed her and my
[23:10] uncle Ronnie said somebody said
[23:12] something about the medication he
[23:13] doesn't believe in that and he said well
[23:15] it was the prayer and he just walked
[23:17] away for him to say that there's God's
[23:20] doing something and I just pray that he
[23:23] uh would get through the uh my uncle's
[23:26] mind and all the knowledge he had that
[23:28] would you know make God you know
[23:31] something else that he's you know isn't
[23:33] or whatever to him so I just pray that
[23:35] you know he gets there but the other
[23:37] testimony is on Friday um my wife came
[23:41] home with the kids and there was an
[23:43] eviction notice on our front door my

[33:56] the mountains and come down to his area
[33:59] and uh yeah you could just keep these

[34:05] just start preaching and then people
[34:07] will start Gathering and he'll start
[34:09] telling about the gospel and it's a it's
[34:13] a a a wonderful opportunity these are

[37:01] great
[37:02] power to not remember our

[38:17] closer to you let us leave here closer
[38:19] to you than when we came we'll be
[38:22] careful to give you honor
[38:24] praise Thanksgiving for these things for
[38:26] we humbly ask it in Jesus Christ's name
[38:29] amen amen amen 2 Corinthians chapter 5
[38:32] starting with verse number nine
[38:35] wherefore we
[38:37] labor that whether present or absent we
[38:42] may be accepted of him so the way to be
[38:47] accepted is we have to labor if we don't
[38:49] labor we can't be accepted for we must
[38:53] all appear before the Judgment seat of
[38:56] Christ that everyone may receive of the
[38:59] things done in his body according to
[39:01] have uh according to that he have done
[39:04] whether it be good or bad and it's
[39:06] always good to labor for the Lord amen
[39:10] knowing therefore the terror the
[39:12] seriousness of the lord we persuade men
[39:17] or or we convince
[39:19] men but we are made
[39:23] manifest unto God and I trust also are
[39:26] made manifest in your conscience vers I
[39:29] want to drop down to verse 14 save it a
[39:31] little bit for the love of Christ now it
[39:34] constrains
[39:35] us it constrains us to persuade men
[39:40] because we thus judge that if Christ
[39:42] died for all then we're all
[39:47] dead and that Christ died for all then
[39:51] they which live should not henceforth
[39:55] live unto themselves anymore but unto
[39:58] him that died for them and rose
[40:02] again wherefore henceforth know we know
[40:05] man after the flesh ye though we have
[40:08] known Christ after the flesh yet now
[40:11] henceforth know we him no more in other
[40:14] words we don't know Christ through
[40:16] intellect through understanding through
[40:18] knowledge we don't know Christ like we
[40:20] would learn about a spaceship in a
[40:22] textbook or an encyclopedia we know
[40:25] Christ by
[40:26] revelation amen therefore If any man be
[40:30] in Christ he is a
[40:33] completely new creature or New
[40:37] Creation old things are passed away
[40:39] behold all things are become new and not
[40:43] only is it one frying pan to the next
[40:46] it's all things are of God so this new
[40:49] is just one thing it's
[40:52] God who have reconciled us to himself by
[40:55] Jesus Christ and given to us the
[40:57] ministry of
[40:59] reconciliation to it or after the manner
[41:01] that God was in Christ reconciling the
[41:04] world to himself not imputing their
[41:06] trespasses upon
[41:08] them and he has committed unto us the
[41:12] word of reconciliation to do the same
[41:15] thing now then we are ambassadors for
[41:17] Christ as though God did beseech You by
[41:20] us we pray you in Christ dead be ye
[41:24] reconciled to God amen amen God bless
[41:27] you you may be
[41:29] seated want to entitle this today our
[41:33] Mission Ministry and our Mission
[41:35] Ministry is really to reconcile others
[41:38] amen and and it's not given by the
[41:41] church it's been given by God almighty
[41:44] this is a commission that's that has
[41:46] been given by God to each of us and for
[41:50] a subject today we'd like to talk about
[41:52] our responsibility in reconciling others
[41:55] it is a responsibility if we become new
[41:58] creatures in Christ then God has
[42:00] automatically given us the ministry of
[42:03] reconciliation so it is important for us
[42:08] that that we labor to reconcile others
[42:11] because um if we're going to be accepted
[42:13] of him we've got to take on the
[42:15] responsibility that he's given us
[42:18] because we're all going to appear before
[42:19] joh we're all going to have to give an
[42:20] account to God what we did with our
[42:24] time are you with me true all right so
[42:28] if we heard a few more amen say it won't
[42:30] hurt me I just want you to know it'll be
[42:32] completely okay am brother B says we
[42:36] must accept our
[42:38] responsibility Jesus said go out and
[42:42] just putting in a nutshell go you out
[42:44] and save Souls am that's what he told us
[42:47] to do brother brand said our missionary
[42:50] work is always in the will of God it's
[42:53] you no matter what you're doing for this
[42:57] Ministry in however you're doing it if
[43:00] it's to reconcile another Soul it is
[43:03] always you're always in the will of God
[43:06] and it is really the only thing that we
[43:08] can have confidence in
[43:10] yes and and the result of that is heaven
[43:13] rejoices amen with just one soul that
[43:16] comes to this is the most important
[43:18] thing that we can do on planet Earth now
[43:21] there are two ways that we can view our
[43:23] responsibility in missionary work and
[43:25] number one is give some some money into
[43:28] the missionary box and and it'll go
[43:30] towards missionaries overseas and that's
[43:32] all I'm going to say that because I
[43:33] don't want to talk about that today I
[43:35] want to talk about our
[43:37] responsibility in leaving the church
[43:39] today and helping others come to know
[43:43] Jesus Christ personally amen because
[43:45] that is such a great
[43:48] responsibility now I'm going to be
[43:50] asking a lot of questions and the reason
[43:52] I'm going to be asking these questions
[43:53] is because I want to prompt your
[43:55] thinking I want you to think about these
[43:57] things because the devil works very hard
[44:01] at deceiving people amen and the word is
[44:04] given to us as a as a light for our feet
[44:09] a lamp for our path right yes and so I'm
[44:12] so glad that we have the word of God
[44:14] today now how do people become
[44:17] reconciled to God if we're supposed to
[44:19] go out through and reconcile how do
[44:21] people become reconciled to
[44:24] God is it by putting their name on a
[44:27] church
[44:28] registry how about repeating the
[44:31] Apostles Creed how about burning so many
[44:34] candles how about saying we
[44:39] believe how about getting
[44:43] baptized how about saying you're born
[44:48] again how about attending a
[44:51] church how about giving
[44:53] offerings no no no no no
[44:57] but amazing how many people have settled
[44:59] for these things in thinking that they
[45:02] have been be reconciled to God there's
[45:06] only one way a man can be reconciled to
[45:09] God and that is through the blood of the
[45:11] Lord Jesus Christ it is the only way
[45:14] amen Jesus is the way the truth and the
[45:17] life amen the Oxford Dictionary's
[45:20] definition of reconcile is to restore
[45:24] friendly relationships between
[45:27] so now God has given us this
[45:30] responsibility to restore friendly
[45:32] relationships between
[45:34] God and the human
[45:37] being that is that's an awesome
[45:42] responsibility
[45:43] now under normal circumstances let's
[45:46] just say these two boys were fighting
[45:48] right
[45:50] here well I would probably want to step
[45:53] in find out what's going on and see if
[45:56] we could get a
[45:58] compromise right settle things down try
[46:00] to get a
[46:01] compromise but when it comes to
[46:03] restoring a human being a soul to God
[46:08] God does not compromise with man that's
[46:10] right there's no compromising with with
[46:13] man I mean with God but what we do have
[46:16] to do is we have to persuade or convince
[46:19] others that God's word God's way is the
[46:22] only way to get reconciled to God a very
[46:25] difficult it's a very difficult thing to
[46:28] do and I believe that's why we have to
[46:31] get the Holy Ghost amen we do we have to
[46:34] become new creatures God has to take
[46:36] over so he can work through our lives
[46:41] amen so how do people become reconciled
[46:44] to
[46:45] God I got some questions here can I
[46:49] really get saved from Hell without being
[46:53] reconciled to
[46:55] God
[46:58] can I get saved without entering the
[47:02] straight and narrow gate
[47:05] no can I get saved without having to do
[47:08] God's
[47:10] will or without picking up my
[47:14] cross can I get saved by believing in
[47:17] God the way I want to believe in
[47:24] God can I just confess Jesus is my Lord
[47:27] and Savior make it
[47:29] no wow see these are these are some hard
[47:33] questions I
[47:34] believe but how often
[47:37] people who walk away from the fullness
[47:41] of the word and take some of these
[47:43] things so they can feel Justified and
[47:45] that they're still going to make
[47:49] it now if reconciliation is restoring a
[47:53] relationship then there are two sides of
[47:58] reconciliation one is the side that of
[48:02] of God which he so loved the world that
[48:05] he gave his only begotten son he shed
[48:07] his blood that the middle the partition
[48:11] that stood between man and God could be
[48:13] taken out of the way and the blood there
[48:16] is our atonement and now we can freely
[48:19] come boldly to God Amen but we cannot
[48:24] come to
[48:25] him
[48:27] with unconfessed
[48:30] sinsen we just can't we have to confess
[48:35] them we have we just have to get it out
[48:38] there and and and and and God's blood is
[48:42] there why you know Calvary was there to
[48:45] cover our
[48:47] sins so if we just confess them he can
[48:50] cover them and then we have that
[48:51] fellowship with him that Union with
[48:55] him
[48:58] now the Bible says that he died for the
[49:01] whole world unfortunately the whole
[49:03] world did not accept him does not accept
[49:07] him there's enough Grace out there to
[49:09] save the whole
[49:10] world but people do not accept his
[49:14] grace now the other side of
[49:16] reconciliation is for man to accept the
[49:20] pardon to accept his
[49:22] grace question can I accept his pardon
[49:26] which is totally separated from any
[49:29] works that I could do or is there
[49:33] something I need to
[49:35] do is there something I need to
[49:41] do because if there was nothing that I
[49:43] needed to do then the whole world would
[49:45] be
[49:46] free right so there is something that
[49:50] needs to be done you must believe in God
[49:54] according to the scriptures you cannot
[49:57] believe God the way that you think the
[49:59] way you feel the way it it seems the way
[50:02] even the way you've been taught by mom
[50:04] or dad or I'll say the way that you've
[50:06] been taught by a church because that
[50:08] church may have been a man-made Church
[50:10] it may have been man uh
[50:13] conception we've got to believe Christ
[50:16] according to the scriptures amen amen
[50:19] amen now can I just believe and get
[50:21] baptized to get my
[50:24] salvation well I'm going to say this yes
[50:27] and no I'm I'm going to give you the
[50:29] scriptures for yes Mark 16:16 he that
[50:32] believeth and is baptized shall be
[50:35] saved he that believeth not shall be
[50:39] damned Romans 10:
[50:42] 9-13 that if Thou shalt confess with thy
[50:45] mouth the Lord Jesus and Shall Believe
[50:46] in thine heart that God have raised him
[50:48] from the dead thou shall be
[50:52] saved for with the heart man believeth
[50:55] unto righteousness and with with the
[50:56] mouth confession is made unto salvation
[50:59] for the scripture saith whosoever
[51:02] believeth on him shall not be ashamed
[51:05] amen for there is no difference between
[51:07] the Jew and the Greek for the same Lord
[51:10] overall is Rich unto all that call upon
[51:13] him for whosoever shall call upon the
[51:16] name of the Lord shall be saved amen now
[51:21] I I love this because this is showing me
[51:24] the Simplicity of how to get connected
[51:27] with God how to start and this process
[51:31] of being reconciled and how to get
[51:35] reconciled but
[51:37] understand there's there's a huge
[51:40] difference between
[51:42] believing in God the way the scriptures
[51:45] say and believing in God the way I want
[51:47] to
[51:48] believe everybody has their own
[51:51] interpretation as it were or their own
[51:54] belief system and this is what scar
[51:56] because these scriptures are meant
[51:59] exactly one
[52:00] way it is is not
[52:03] meant hundreds of thousands of different
[52:06] ways for different people it's it's just
[52:08] one
[52:11] way now James 2 verse 19 tells us that
[52:16] thou believest that there's one God thou
[52:18] doest well the Devils also believe and
[52:22] tremble so they have a belief system and
[52:25] they believe in God they I'll say I'll
[52:27] say the those Devils believe more in God
[52:30] than a lot of eight
[52:31] people atheists out there there's a lot
[52:34] of people out there that they don't even
[52:36] and you know the god that they do know
[52:38] isn't the real
[52:40] God so the Devils know who the real God
[52:43] is it's the
[52:47] truth they had a account a not a a in
[52:52] they had a little encounter that's what
[52:53] I'm looking for in in MA in Matthew
[52:56] chapter 8: 29 behold they CED these
[52:59] demons cried out saying what have we to
[53:02] do with thee Jesus thou Son of God Art
[53:05] Thou come hither to torment us before
[53:09] the
[53:10] time so here they are they're believers
[53:13] they confess with their mouth the Lord
[53:15] Jesus but they're not
[53:19] saved so it's not as easy as just saying
[53:24] you believe and confessing with your
[53:27] mouth there's more to it than
[53:29] that because you got to confess with
[53:33] your
[53:34] life any person that confesses with
[53:37] their mouth but their life does not
[53:40] display it it is evil it is wrong it is
[53:44] a wrong
[53:45] confession the confession has to be with
[53:48] your life your
[53:50] heart are you with me
[53:54] amen all right Jesus said by their fruit
[53:56] you shall know them all right this is
[53:58] the scripture I want you to write down
[54:00] it's John
[54:02] 5:39 the scripture says search the
[54:07] scriptures for in them you think you
[54:11] have eternal life but they are they
[54:15] which testify of
[54:18] me every person should care enough about
[54:21] their salvation to search out their
[54:25] scriptures to see where they're standing
[54:27] to make sure that they're believing the
[54:29] right
[54:32] way I don't want to be part of that
[54:34] group where many
[54:37] come and and miss it because they had a
[54:40] false sense of security amen 1 John
[54:44] chapter 5 verse 13 says talking about
[54:47] the scriptures these things have I
[54:49] written unto you that believe on my name
[54:51] believe on the name of the son of God
[54:53] that ye may know that you have eternal
[54:56] life and that ye may believe on the name
[54:59] of the son of God so the word is written
[55:02] to where we can know there's no
[55:03] guesswork I have met God's
[55:06] requirements and the scriptures are the
[55:08] only thing that can properly identify
[55:11] our
[55:12] Salvation second Timothy chapter 3:1 15
[55:16] 2 Timothy chapter 3:15 and just just I
[55:20] believe that this is this is um God is
[55:24] here God is here in this message here we
[55:26] we um those of us that are rock solid
[55:31] saved we we've met God's
[55:33] requirement uh I believe this is a good
[55:35] message to help us to know how to
[55:37] reconcile
[55:40] others and and those that are looking
[55:42] for the way I believe these These are
[55:45] good scriptures here all right 2 Timothy
[55:48] 3:15 and that from a child thou has
[55:51] known the holy scriptures which are able
[55:56] to make thee wise unto
[56:00] salvation through faith which is in
[56:03] Christ
[56:06] Jesus I'd rather
[56:09] have I'd rather have this book I don't
[56:11] mean it wrong I'd rather have this book
[56:15] and never enter a
[56:20] church I mean I'm thankful for a
[56:22] fivefold Ministry it's for my perfecting
[56:24] and we need it
[56:27] but there are the devil uses preachers
[56:31] of all kinds to confuse people and to
[56:34] get them off the get them on off off the
[56:36] on the wrong track amen get them off the
[56:39] right track on the wrong track but the
[56:41] scriptures will make us wise unto
[56:44] salvation amen the Bible says all
[56:47] scripture is given by the inspiration of
[56:50] God and it is profitable for Doctrine
[56:54] for Repro for correction how many wants
[56:57] correction for instruction in
[56:59] righteousness that the man of God may be
[57:02] perfect thoroughly furnished unto all
[57:05] good works well these good works is we
[57:08] need to help reconcile others to Christ
[57:12] amen Jesus said in John 14:12 verily
[57:16] verily I say unto you he that believeth
[57:19] on
[57:19] me the works I do shall he do also now
[57:24] that's a little bit different than what
[57:25] we're reading there in Romans isn't it
[57:28] the works that I do shall he do also and
[57:31] Greater Works than these shall he do
[57:34] because I go to my father true sincere
[57:39] belief is associated with the very works
[57:42] of Jesus
[57:44] Christ but we can believe on Jesus
[57:47] Christ and not have those
[57:50] works but we're not believing properly
[57:53] we're not believing
[57:55] completely because GE we've got to
[57:57] search the
[58:01] scriptures because they are they are
[58:03] they which testify of who Jesus Christ
[58:07] is
[58:12] so can I really get saved from Hell
[58:16] without being reconciled to God I mean
[58:19] he died for
[58:20] me I I accept what he did at
[58:23] Calvary isn't that good enough
[58:30] the answer is simply no we must get
[58:33] reconciled to God just like everyone
[58:35] else who got saved Jesus said you must
[58:37] be born again there must come forth uh a
[58:42] an Evidence in our life a new
[58:45] creature that that all things now are
[58:48] are like
[58:49] Jesus we're we're no longer the same
[58:54] person and that I'll say it like this
[58:56] because you know trees take time to grow
[58:59] flowers things take time to grow we as
[59:02] Christians it takes time to grow now
[59:05] what's growing is not just the knowledge
[59:08] about the Bible but it's the character
[59:10] of Jesus Christ in our
[59:12] lives and that needs that's the evidence
[59:15] of where we're standing with God Jesus
[59:17] said by their fruits you shall know them
[59:20] now when you look up in the Greek this
[59:22] word reconcile it means to change
[59:27] mutually
[59:29] mutually it's got to go through free
[59:31] more agency both parties have to be in
[59:35] agreement with it that's why the
[59:37] majority of the world goes to hell
[59:40] because they are not mutually agreeing
[59:42] with the
[59:44] word they're going to climb up some
[59:46] other way they're going to go the
[59:50] Broadway a and and they're being
[59:53] deceived by the devil
[59:56] but thank
[59:58] God that there's a
[1:00:01] truth the ministry of reconciliation or
[1:00:04] the word of reconciliation means to
[1:00:07] exchange something in order to bring
[1:00:11] about a restoration to a soul so we were
[1:00:14] all born in sin shapen in
[1:00:17] iniquity and uh
[1:00:21] most the devil wants us to believe that
[1:00:24] alls we have to do is accept what Jesus
[1:00:27] did 2,000 years ago and we don't have to
[1:00:31] change that is basically the conception
[1:00:35] that the devil
[1:00:36] has it's called
[1:00:40] religion God gave up his life for us and
[1:00:45] we've got to give up our life for
[1:00:48] God anything short of that is short of
[1:00:52] Salvation now that's why there's going
[1:00:54] to be what's called the great white
[1:00:56] Throne
[1:00:57] judgment after that things are going to
[1:01:00] be settled but I'm so glad God gave me
[1:01:03] his word that I may know that I have
[1:01:06] eternal life I don't have to wait till
[1:01:09] the day of judgment I can have boldness
[1:01:12] the Bible says because as he is so are
[1:01:15] we in this
[1:01:19] world so can I get my soul saved without
[1:01:24] giving up anything
[1:01:29] how about this one can I be saved
[1:01:31] without my very nature
[1:01:36] changing so what is
[1:01:41] salvation is it just being saved from
[1:01:45] hell I believe salvation is when we are
[1:01:48] saved from the nature of a
[1:01:53] self-willed selfish self-centered
[1:01:56] live for
[1:01:59] myself it's all about
[1:02:01] me to where all things are about God now
[1:02:05] in my
[1:02:08] life so it's not like I'm I'm saved from
[1:02:11] a a a a a fire a a place that burn with
[1:02:15] fire and brimstone which is true that's
[1:02:18] his
[1:02:19] hell but understand hell was created for
[1:02:22] the devil and his angels it wasn't
[1:02:24] created for us that's
[1:02:28] right but if my nature continues I mean
[1:02:31] I can I can get baptized and and re go
[1:02:35] to church but if I still have that
[1:02:37] selfish nature inside of me I'm still
[1:02:41] Hellbound right
[1:02:44] amen and I know it's not a very
[1:02:48] popular
[1:02:51] Ministry or a popular preaching or
[1:02:53] something but you know what how many
[1:02:56] people do you think on the day of
[1:02:59] judgment are going to stand and look at
[1:03:01] their preacher that preached to them all
[1:03:05] those years and said I thought all I had
[1:03:07] to do was this
[1:03:09] preacher I thought all I had to do was
[1:03:12] this and you you would take care of
[1:03:14] everything there's going to be a lot
[1:03:16] Jesus said the blind lead the blind they
[1:03:19] both fall in the
[1:03:22] ditch every day we should wake up and
[1:03:25] thank God for the revelation of the
[1:03:29] word I believe that salvation is when
[1:03:33] we've been reconciled to the will of
[1:03:37] God reconciled to the will of God we're
[1:03:40] no longer
[1:03:41] fighting oh I got to do the will of
[1:03:46] God no we've accepted it for our life it
[1:03:49] becomes our
[1:03:50] life you've been born
[1:03:53] again by the word of God by the will of
[1:03:56] God to do the will of
[1:03:59] God that's what it means where All
[1:04:01] Things
[1:04:02] become of
[1:04:05] God we're no
[1:04:07] longer part of it therefore If any man
[1:04:10] be in Christ he's a new creature old
[1:04:11] things are passed away behold all things
[1:04:14] have become new and all things are of
[1:04:16] God Amen turn with me if you would to
[1:04:19] Matthew
[1:04:22] 28 when we're sharing with
[1:04:24] others
[1:04:26] Christ I believe we ought to be sharing
[1:04:29] with
[1:04:31] them the original Plan of
[1:04:35] Salvation not our ideas about
[1:04:42] it and we're going to go through a
[1:04:44] couple of scriptures here so don't leave
[1:04:47] church until it's
[1:04:49] over want you to get the whole thing
[1:04:52] here Matthew 2018 and Jesus came and
[1:04:55] spake unto them saying all power is
[1:04:56] given unto me in heaven and earth go ye
[1:05:00] therefore and teach All
[1:05:03] Nations baptizing them in the name of
[1:05:05] the father and of the son and of the
[1:05:07] Holy Ghost and we know that the name of
[1:05:09] the father and the Son and the Holy
[1:05:12] Ghost is the Lord Jesus Christ we know
[1:05:14] that teaching them to observe all things
[1:05:19] whatsoever I've commanded you and lo I
[1:05:21] Am With You Always even unto the end of
[1:05:24] the world so now he has given us a
[1:05:27] responsibility here our ministry ought
[1:05:30] to be to go out and teach the true Plan
[1:05:32] of
[1:05:34] Salvation to baptize them
[1:05:36] correctly and don't stop
[1:05:39] there he says this Grand statement that
[1:05:42] ought to put the fear of God in every
[1:05:43] one of
[1:05:44] us he
[1:05:46] says teach them to observe all
[1:05:51] things that Jesus commanded
[1:05:54] us wow you mean I I just don't got to
[1:05:58] just just you know lead them to to just
[1:06:01] to repent and get baptized and then and
[1:06:03] then stop and
[1:06:06] no no because we're trying to lead them
[1:06:09] to a new birth
[1:06:11] am hey re repentance and baptism isn't
[1:06:14] going to guarantee the new
[1:06:18] birth because a lot of times uh people
[1:06:21] don't understand what they're repenting
[1:06:24] of
[1:06:28] so we've got to help them we've got to
[1:06:30] help
[1:06:32] them now can I cast out Devils prophesy
[1:06:36] speak in tongues and do many wonderful
[1:06:38] works and still not know
[1:06:42] Christ that's scripture so any man
[1:06:45] that's in Christ he's a new creature he
[1:06:47] knows Christ so it's not by doing these
[1:06:52] things it's it's by living the same life
[1:06:56] that Christ lives because I can do these
[1:06:59] things and live like a devil
[1:07:02] true many will come to me in that
[1:07:06] day many are not observing all the
[1:07:09] things that Christ has commanded
[1:07:12] them you talk to people are you a
[1:07:14] Christian are you born again yeah I'm
[1:07:16] born again yeah I'm a Christian yeah I
[1:07:18] got baptized and it stops there there's
[1:07:21] no other
[1:07:23] evidence they got excuse for everything
[1:07:25] else else going on in their
[1:07:27] life but we have the responsibility as
[1:07:30] ambassadors of Jesus Christ to to teach
[1:07:33] them to observe all things that the
[1:07:35] Bible says and no they ain't going to
[1:07:37] want to hear it it's just be
[1:07:40] honest they they want they what they
[1:07:42] want to hear is you're doing a good job
[1:07:44] keep at
[1:07:46] it yet you don't have to do nothing else
[1:07:50] and that's scary I don't want to I'm
[1:07:54] lying to
[1:07:56] God I'm lying to
[1:07:59] them if I tell them the truth look the
[1:08:02] Bible says if how can you be a servant
[1:08:05] to God when you're serving man how can
[1:08:07] you please God when you're pleasing man
[1:08:09] it's not about friendship down here
[1:08:12] friends it's about getting people to
[1:08:15] Jesus Christ it is the most important
[1:08:17] thing we can
[1:08:19] do so we ought to teach others to
[1:08:21] observe all things that Jesus commanded
[1:08:24] to repent to get
[1:08:26] baptized to love others like Jesus loved
[1:08:29] us to lay down teach them to lay down
[1:08:32] their life as Jesus laid down his life
[1:08:35] for
[1:08:35] them the Bible says if you love me keep
[1:08:38] my commandments so we need to teach them
[1:08:40] to observe that to stay connected in the
[1:08:43] vine to keep bearing fruit now these are
[1:08:46] just things in the
[1:08:48] scriptures that we should be helping
[1:08:50] others to observe is that are you with
[1:08:52] me all right brother Ben said in the
[1:08:55] Mage questions and answers he says some
[1:08:57] of you oldtimers here let me ask you
[1:08:59] something you oldtimers that's been in
[1:09:02] the Tabernacle watch when I baptize
[1:09:05] people and you ministers take this for
[1:09:08] an example kind of let you know where
[1:09:10] I'm coming at here today he says I've
[1:09:13] taught those those people till they had
[1:09:17] their life cleaned up before they went
[1:09:19] into that
[1:09:20] water and
[1:09:22] then I had them believing that God was
[1:09:25] obligated to keep his promise as soon as
[1:09:28] they were baptized in the name of the
[1:09:30] Lord Jesus Christ the Holy Spirit was
[1:09:32] right there to receive them amen and
[1:09:35] when they come up out of the water they
[1:09:37] receive the Holy Ghost he said that's
[1:09:40] right why you reading that brother John
[1:09:43] I'm reading that because of this next
[1:09:44] words right here he said Shepherds teach
[1:09:48] your
[1:09:49] sheep get them in the Bible here get
[1:09:52] away from that Old textbook of some
[1:09:54] church and get down here in the Bible
[1:09:57] where God taught and you won't have
[1:09:59] those troubles see if you don't lead
[1:10:01] somebody to Christ all the way you're
[1:10:03] just going to have a bunch of
[1:10:05] troubles you've got to lead people to
[1:10:07] Christ they've got to have a personal
[1:10:09] relationship to where they trust God for
[1:10:11] their life they trust God for their
[1:10:13] trials they trust God for what they're
[1:10:15] going through because everybody is going
[1:10:17] to go through test and trials and we got
[1:10:19] to hang on to God we can't hang on to
[1:10:21] one another we hang on to God he's the
[1:10:24] one that will save us through it
[1:10:27] all there's only one true baptism but
[1:10:31] there are many false
[1:10:32] ones Ephesians 4:5 said there's one Lord
[1:10:35] one faith and one baptism if someone has
[1:10:38] been baptized incorrectly it is our
[1:10:42] responsibility to teach them the correct
[1:10:44] way to be baptized a good example of
[1:10:47] that is Acts chapter 19 if you want to
[1:10:50] write it down and read that if someone
[1:10:52] needs to be baptized God is given us the
[1:10:56] word of reconciliation how to get them
[1:10:59] restored to God that's an awesome
[1:11:02] responsibility to care about somebody's
[1:11:04] soul and get them to Jesus
[1:11:06] Christ we know the right way all right
[1:11:09] Acts chapter 2: 36 are you getting
[1:11:12] something out of this am all right
[1:11:14] praise the lord it's okay to be quiet if
[1:11:16] you're getting something out of
[1:11:20] it all right Acts chapter 2:3 this is
[1:11:23] when the Holy Ghost came down they were
[1:11:25] waiting in the upper
[1:11:28] room therefore let all the house of
[1:11:31] Israel know assuredly no question no
[1:11:34] doubt about it that God have made that
[1:11:38] same Jesus whom ye have crucified both
[1:11:43] lord of the Old
[1:11:46] Testament and the Holy
[1:11:49] Ghost the anointed Messiah amen that
[1:11:53] same son Jesus both Lord Jehovah and
[1:11:57] Holy
[1:11:58] Ghost and when they heard this they were
[1:12:00] pricked in their heart and they said
[1:12:02] Peter unto Peter and to the rest of the
[1:12:05] Apostles men and Brethren what shall we
[1:12:07] do how do how do we going to get saved
[1:12:10] how do we get
[1:12:12] saved and then Peter having the keys
[1:12:14] Jesus gave him the keys there in Matthew
[1:12:16] 3
[1:12:17] 16 then Peter said unto them
[1:12:20] repent and be baptized every one of you
[1:12:24] in the name
[1:12:25] of Jesus Christ for the remission of
[1:12:28] sins and ye shall receive the gift of
[1:12:31] the Holy Ghost that is such a precious
[1:12:37] promise for the promise is not only to
[1:12:41] you but unto your
[1:12:43] children and unto all that are far off
[1:12:47] even as many as the Lord Our God shall
[1:12:51] call and with many other words did he
[1:12:54] testify and them saying save
[1:12:58] yourself got to go through a few more
[1:13:00] agency save yourself from this entour
[1:13:04] generation well if that was an ENT
[1:13:06] generation then imagine what it is right
[1:13:08] now it is the worst that's ever been and
[1:13:11] it ain't getting any better and we've
[1:13:13] got to save ourselves say Amen we've got
[1:13:15] to jump in the pool we've got to come to
[1:13:17] Christ we got to get the Holy Ghost
[1:13:20] nothing short of it will work then they
[1:13:24] that gladly
[1:13:26] received the word see there's this joint
[1:13:30] working together amen they that gladly
[1:13:34] received his word were baptized and the
[1:13:37] same day there were added unto them
[1:13:40] about 3,000
[1:13:44] Souls wow that's a
[1:13:46] lot that's beautiful glory to God glory
[1:13:51] to God so what are we repenting from
[1:13:57] what are we repenting
[1:14:00] from some think it's saying sorry to the
[1:14:04] Lord for the wrong things they've done
[1:14:06] in the
[1:14:10] past like Lord I'm in a
[1:14:14] pickle I need a savior please save
[1:14:19] me I accept you as my
[1:14:22] savior and this is the concept
[1:14:26] of
[1:14:28] repentance and I I know this is such an
[1:14:31] elementary
[1:14:33] subject
[1:14:36] but we've got to get down to
[1:14:40] it we're really repenting from our old
[1:14:42] sinful lustful
[1:14:45] nature we're repenting from living our
[1:14:48] life according to our will and
[1:14:50] repentance means turn around
[1:14:53] 180° to think different and start living
[1:14:56] for God Amen that's what repentance is
[1:15:00] and that's the first step to getting
[1:15:03] saved and it is the most crucial step
[1:15:07] because if you only turn around 10
[1:15:09] degrees if you're only sorry for your
[1:15:12] past sins but you still want to live
[1:15:14] life for yourself that's not true
[1:15:18] repentance that's why many people go
[1:15:20] back out in the
[1:15:23] world so when men and women accept
[1:15:26] Christ as their lord and savior they're
[1:15:28] accepting the will of God for their
[1:15:33] lives you take a totally different way
[1:15:35] of
[1:15:36] thinking Romans 122 we don't have time
[1:15:39] to read it we're going to have to scoot
[1:15:41] Philippians Philippians chapter 2:5 let
[1:15:44] this mind be in you which was also in
[1:15:47] Christ Jesus Jesus said you must be born
[1:15:50] again this is what it means you're when
[1:15:52] you're born by the will of God you're
[1:15:54] Bor born to do his will you're not just
[1:15:57] you know when I first came to the Lord I
[1:15:59] did not understand what it meant to be
[1:16:00] born again I'll be honest with
[1:16:03] you you must be born again okay what
[1:16:05] does that
[1:16:08] mean you mean Jesus has to will me to be
[1:16:10] born okay Jesus Will me to be born here
[1:16:13] I
[1:16:14] am I I just I couldn't I didn't have the
[1:16:17] concept of what it means but when you're
[1:16:19] born by the will of
[1:16:21] God look it there ain't no parent here
[1:16:25] that would ever have a child that would
[1:16:27] want to have a child that would not
[1:16:29] listen to
[1:16:30] them not a parent
[1:16:34] here everyone that's had a child wants
[1:16:37] that child to obey them can you imagine
[1:16:41] from the year two years old till they're
[1:16:46] out of the house nothing but hell and
[1:16:48] don't want to listen to
[1:16:52] you God does not want anybody in heaven
[1:16:55] that ain't going to listen to
[1:16:58] him we're we're born to serve the Lord
[1:17:02] to obey his word brother Ron you sang
[1:17:04] that song trust and
[1:17:06] Obey that's what it means to be born
[1:17:08] again and there's a process of this you
[1:17:12] we be become Justified Sanctified and
[1:17:15] then filled with the Holy Ghost Brandon
[1:17:17] said in a message time tested Memorials
[1:17:20] of God and my daughter had this uh hang
[1:17:25] up on her her wall and I often think of
[1:17:27] it says when you come to Christ if you
[1:17:31] can't absolutely sell out Lock Stock and
[1:17:35] Barrel and come to Christ he said don't
[1:17:38] come at
[1:17:40] all if you can't turn around completely
[1:17:44] and give your life to Jesus Christ don't
[1:17:51] come because God's looking for all of
[1:17:53] our heart amen that's it if we seek to
[1:17:56] save our life we'll lose
[1:18:00] it so after true repentance comes water
[1:18:05] baptism if a person doesn't mean
[1:18:07] business with God
[1:18:10] then if he's just trying to escape hell
[1:18:13] shall we say but if he doesn't he's not
[1:18:16] real serious with doing God's will he's
[1:18:19] just going to go down into the water a
[1:18:23] wet sinner and come up a wet
[1:18:26] sinner you see there has to be a change
[1:18:31] the Bible tells us that 1 Peter 3:21 if
[1:18:35] you want to write it down water baptism
[1:18:37] does not put away the filth of the Flesh
[1:18:41] in other words it doesn't change our
[1:18:42] vile nature it doesn't regenerate our
[1:18:45] soul water baptism is only an expression
[1:18:49] outwardly that we have taken the will of
[1:18:52] God in our life amen the Bible says it's
[1:18:55] an answer of a good conscience towards
[1:18:58] God in other words water baptism does
[1:19:01] not regenerate our nature it doesn't re
[1:19:04] it doesn't produce a new birth it's an
[1:19:07] outward expression that the blood has
[1:19:11] regenerated your soul through faith in
[1:19:13] the word that something is happening
[1:19:16] inside of
[1:19:18] you Romans 6:3 says know ye not that as
[1:19:21] many as were baptized into Jesus were
[1:19:24] baptized to his death therefore we are
[1:19:26] buried with him in baptism into death
[1:19:29] that like as Jesus was raised from the
[1:19:32] dead by the glory of the father even so
[1:19:33] we should walk in newness of life we
[1:19:37] come out of that water we're ready to
[1:19:39] start moving
[1:19:41] forward All Things become new all things
[1:19:45] uh are of God and you know it never
[1:19:47] stops this is the exciting thing about
[1:19:49] serving God from your heart it's always
[1:19:52] fresh it never stops you're always
[1:19:55] growing in Christ Jesus it's
[1:19:58] beautiful brother brandham said in the
[1:20:00] message questions and answers he said
[1:20:02] there'll be thousands there that were
[1:20:05] that have been baptized in jesus'
[1:20:07] name like this you'll go down a dry
[1:20:10] Center and you'll come up a wet
[1:20:12] one he says but as as the genuine True
[1:20:15] Believer you must walk in all faith and
[1:20:20] good conscience towards God when you see
[1:20:22] it if you've been baptized
[1:20:25] but I believe that if only it's only an
[1:20:29] outward expression showing that an
[1:20:31] inward work of Grace has been
[1:20:35] done now you know people want to get
[1:20:38] baptized for various reasons we don't
[1:20:41] want to ever discourage anybody from
[1:20:43] being baptized yet at the same time we
[1:20:46] should if we're involved in wanting
[1:20:48] somebody to get baptized we should
[1:20:51] care we should really care about where
[1:20:54] they set out to be after they're
[1:20:56] baptized we just should and a good
[1:20:59] example of this is in Luke
[1:21:02] 3:7 and and this is where they came to
[1:21:06] John they wanted to get baptized then
[1:21:08] said he to the multitude that came for
[1:21:10] to get baptized of him he says oh
[1:21:12] Generation of Vipers who has warned you
[1:21:14] to flee from the raft to
[1:21:16] come so they came to John they wanted to
[1:21:19] get
[1:21:20] baptized because they knew they needed
[1:21:23] to get baptized
[1:21:25] and he said bring forth fruit meat I'm
[1:21:28] sorry bring forth fruits worthy of
[1:21:32] repentance in other words you just can't
[1:21:35] say I'm
[1:21:44] sorry yes and they wanted to get
[1:21:46] baptized they wanted they knew that
[1:21:50] there was Wrath was
[1:21:53] coming
[1:22:13] right I'll talk to you after service I
[1:22:15] will on this think I was I I will say
[1:22:17] that these are human
[1:22:20] beings Pharisee
[1:22:22] sadducee whoever
[1:22:26] and yeah Pharisee just means
[1:22:28] actor it just means an actor but yet
[1:22:32] there was something
[1:22:34] inside that they
[1:22:36] knew wrath was
[1:22:39] coming and they needed to get baptized
[1:22:42] so inside of them there was a signal
[1:22:44] going on that we need to do
[1:22:46] something and I think it's no different
[1:22:49] than some people that live
[1:22:51] today they know they need to get
[1:22:56] baptized but do they really want to give
[1:22:58] their heart to Jesus Christ do they
[1:23:00] really want to follow the straight and
[1:23:02] narrow path and he says bring forth
[1:23:05] therefore fruit worthy of
[1:23:07] repentance and begin not to say within
[1:23:10] yourselves we have Abraham as our Father
[1:23:13] for I say unto you that God is able
[1:23:14] these stones to raise up children to AB
[1:23:17] unto Abraham and now also the ax is laid
[1:23:20] to the root of the trees every tree uh
[1:23:22] therefore which bringeth not good fruit
[1:23:25] it's going to be cast chopped down and
[1:23:28] cast into the
[1:23:31] fire if a man wants to be reconciled to
[1:23:34] God he must repent first from doing his
[1:23:38] will and start doing God's will re
[1:23:43] repent from disbelieving the word and
[1:23:45] and disobeying the word repent for that
[1:23:49] and then you're making a decision I want
[1:23:51] to get baptized and I want to start
[1:23:53] obeying every every word of God because
[1:23:55] Jesus said man shall not live by bread
[1:23:57] alone but by every word that proceedeth
[1:24:00] out of the mouth of God do you believe
[1:24:01] that and get we need to be baptized in
[1:24:05] the name of the Lord Jesus Christ I know
[1:24:07] some of these things they're subjects
[1:24:09] all on their own but uh Acts 4:12 says
[1:24:11] for there is none other name under
[1:24:13] Heaven given among men whereby we must
[1:24:16] be
[1:24:19] saved so how can I how can we get
[1:24:21] someone to Christ without getting them
[1:24:24] Rec to
[1:24:27] God we
[1:24:32] can't when we're leading somebody to
[1:24:34] Christ we have to lead them to the
[1:24:38] word we don't want to present Jesus
[1:24:41] Christ as as as someone that it doesn't
[1:24:44] matter what what life you're living God
[1:24:47] is very interested in our
[1:24:49] life in fact he's so interested in his
[1:24:52] life he wants to have preeminence in her
[1:24:54] life
[1:24:55] amen he wants to live inside of us and
[1:24:58] you know he won't even he won't live
[1:25:00] inside a dirty
[1:25:03] vessel he may come and bless you but he
[1:25:06] won't dwell there so there we we we
[1:25:09] we've got to clean up our lives we got
[1:25:11] to become
[1:25:12] Sanctified it's part of being reconciled
[1:25:15] to the Lord Jesus Christ so knowing
[1:25:18] there for the terror of the Lord now
[1:25:20] he's not a he doesn't push he's a
[1:25:22] gentleman he doesn't Force he doesn't
[1:25:24] make people do things he's a gentleman
[1:25:28] he cares he
[1:25:29] loves but yet he'll never compromise
[1:25:33] with his word amen so we've got to make
[1:25:37] sure that we're we're following the word
[1:25:41] every part of the
[1:25:43] word and the love of Christ if you're
[1:25:46] filled with the Holy Ghost how's got the
[1:25:48] Holy
[1:25:49] Ghost okay now there along with the Holy
[1:25:55] Ghost comes this ministry of
[1:26:00] reconciliation you just care about other
[1:26:03] other people so I know when I was in the
[1:26:05] world I didn't care about other people
[1:26:08] you know I was going to be a musician I
[1:26:11] was going to be a hockey player I was
[1:26:12] going to be a doctor that's what I was
[1:26:14] going to be when I was in the world and
[1:26:16] I told my wife I wasn't going to
[1:26:20] be a machinist and I didn't have any
[1:26:22] thoughts about being a preacher I don't
[1:26:24] know if for like 20 years after I was
[1:26:27] saved but you know
[1:26:29] what God had something else in
[1:26:33] mind something else in
[1:26:37] mind when you come to Christ and he
[1:26:40] fills you with his Spirit how can you
[1:26:43] have Christ and not care about other
[1:26:45] people's Souls
[1:26:48] right so I'll say just caring about
[1:26:51] somebody's soul is a great sign
[1:26:55] that that Ministry is trying to get
[1:26:58] activated inside of us and all we got to
[1:27:01] do is yield to it it's okay if you don't
[1:27:04] know for sure what to say or how to do
[1:27:06] it or you know the when Jesus talked to
[1:27:09] that woman at the well she just went
[1:27:12] into the City and said come see a man
[1:27:14] that told me all things you know she
[1:27:16] wasn't real gifted as it were in being a
[1:27:20] speaker but she led people to the word
[1:27:23] to where Jesus was
[1:27:24] that and the word if they're connected
[1:27:28] to the word the word will lead them
[1:27:30] further amen I just if we could just
[1:27:33] stand together just for a second have a
[1:27:36] a a h a little word of prayer and then
[1:27:39] my wife she has a a testimony I wanted
[1:27:41] her to share and I stoed uh about eight
[1:27:44] minutes of her time I apologize for that
[1:27:47] but
[1:27:48] um how many how many want to
[1:27:51] be an ambassador for Jesus Christ
[1:27:55] amen amen let's let's take this before
[1:27:57] the Lord our heavenly
[1:28:00] father Lord we thank you for the
[1:28:04] truth for you told
[1:28:08] those those that believed on you there
[1:28:11] in John
[1:28:13] 8 you said you shall know the truth and
[1:28:16] the truth shall make you free if you
[1:28:18] continue in my word then are you my
[1:28:20] disciples
[1:28:22] indeed Lord we want to continue in your
[1:28:25] word we want to be ambassadors in this
[1:28:28] Dark Age that we're living in this age
[1:28:30] that is
[1:28:32] so jam-packed with
[1:28:35] confusion no matter what's on the TV
[1:28:39] what's on the radio what's on the news
[1:28:42] who we're talking
[1:28:44] to just seems that there's so much going
[1:28:46] on Lord to distract
[1:28:49] us God I pray for every heart here those
[1:28:53] that are live streaming and those that
[1:28:54] are archiving Lord they have this desire
[1:28:57] in their heart to to be a great witness
[1:29:00] for you to be a greater Ambassador for
[1:29:03] you to help reconcile more souls to
[1:29:06] spend more
[1:29:08] time as it is your
[1:29:11] desire I pray that you would bless them
[1:29:14] give them the heart their heart's desire
[1:29:16] give them souls for their labor may they
[1:29:18] be able to
[1:29:20] share with many on the other side
[1:29:22] because you use them
[1:29:27] and we need the Holy Ghost in US Lord to
[1:29:30] do that may you give us a greater
[1:29:32] portion of your spirit we thank you for
[1:29:34] these things now we humbly pray in Jesus
[1:29:37] Christ's name amen amen God bless you
[1:29:40] you may be seated just for a little bit
[1:29:44] is it is it okay if we just take a
[1:29:46] little bit of time and do a testimony
[1:29:49] yeah this is is so
[1:29:53] edifying
[1:29:57] huh yeah shery told me now I know you
[1:30:00] can't do it just 45 minutes I tried so
[1:30:06] hard weeks ago month ago John asked me
[1:30:10] if I would share something about
[1:30:12] missions I wasn't really given any
[1:30:14] instructions so you just have to bear
[1:30:18] with me it's kind of like a teacher
[1:30:19] giving you an assignment without telling
[1:30:21] you how to do it so so I read this um
[1:30:25] this quote and it says um aspire to
[1:30:31] inspire before you
[1:30:32] expire and I thought that's my goal
[1:30:35] today is just to inspire you there's a
[1:30:38] work to be done for the Lord and to me
[1:30:42] missions is just sharing the love of God
[1:30:44] with somebody that's all it is and I
[1:30:48] wanted to share some of my experiences
[1:30:51] with missions and
[1:30:54] when we've been overseas just to make it
[1:30:57] more relatable to you you really can't
[1:31:01] you've seen the missionary report was
[1:31:03] amazing I was blown away all the videos
[1:31:06] and pictures and but when you actually
[1:31:09] go there and
[1:31:11] experience things it's um it's a whole
[1:31:15] different
[1:31:16] world and I will say that in my time
[1:31:19] serving the lord you know we learned to
[1:31:21] pay ties and offerings right off the bat
[1:31:24] but if you really want to touch the
[1:31:26] heart of God it's missions that is where
[1:31:29] God really is pleased with your life
[1:31:35] and um when when um you know some of
[1:31:40] these when we had the missionary the map
[1:31:42] up here you know it was just so
[1:31:44] incredible to me all that we are doing
[1:31:47] here this the support we are supporting
[1:31:50] so many missionaries across the globe
[1:31:53] and you know I just think some of those
[1:31:55] people have become really dear friends
[1:31:58] to
[1:31:59] us and the work that they're doing is
[1:32:02] just amazing and um you know he showed
[1:32:06] those pictures of brother Gideon this
[1:32:08] morning
[1:32:09] and he hasn't been here in a while he's
[1:32:12] uh had problem getting a Visa but when
[1:32:14] he was here he was just like we'd known
[1:32:17] him forever he was just so relatable and
[1:32:21] so you just sit and talk with him and he
[1:32:24] was terrified of our dog our dog weighs
[1:32:26] 96 lbs and he was terrified of her a lot
[1:32:29] of people in Africa are afraid of dogs
[1:32:32] by the time he left he was begging her
[1:32:34] to sit on his lap and two years ago when
[1:32:37] she almost died he was literally putting
[1:32:39] in prayer requests for her in his church
[1:32:42] and anybody that knows me knows how much
[1:32:44] I love my dog and I'll never forget
[1:32:49] that but we started doing missions many
[1:32:52] years ago we were young
[1:32:54] young and um we did a candy fundraiser
[1:32:58] we sold candy bars and I think we got 50
[1:33:01] cents for every candy bar we sold they
[1:33:03] were dollar we got 50 cents and believe
[1:33:06] it or not we were actually able to build
[1:33:08] a church in Guyana with the money and it
[1:33:11] was like so encouraging to see how far
[1:33:15] the money goes overseas you know you
[1:33:18] couldn't build a church here for the
[1:33:20] money that we had
[1:33:22] but yes
[1:33:24] that's with the
[1:33:27] youth so I'm inspiring you guys okay so
[1:33:31] then we started in 1997 there was a
[1:33:34] hurricane in Honduras and it was a
[1:33:36] devastating hurricane it sent them back
[1:33:39] 50 years in time it was so so
[1:33:42] devastating and we started sending
[1:33:44] supplies down in semi trucks chaita
[1:33:47] banana would come up here full of
[1:33:49] bananas and the trucks were going back
[1:33:51] empty so they allowed us to send
[1:33:54] supplies down we gathered supplies from
[1:33:57] the community and it was quite an
[1:34:00] undertaking we had 3 hours to load the
[1:34:02] semi and otherwise we had to pay and and
[1:34:06] anyways um one time we just sent a whole
[1:34:08] load of beans just nothing but beans
[1:34:11] down and that has kind of got the wheels
[1:34:15] turning and then in
[1:34:17] 1999 John decided that we were going to
[1:34:19] do a golf
[1:34:21] outing and we knew nothing about doing a
[1:34:24] golf outing and so I fell um we had a
[1:34:29] storm it was a winter a summer
[1:34:31] storm and this is really bad idea but I
[1:34:35] couldn't find a flashlight and I needed
[1:34:37] to go downstairs in the old basement we
[1:34:39] have a new basement and an old basement
[1:34:41] and I had to go
[1:34:42] downstairs to turn the breaker on we had
[1:34:45] a generator but you had to flip Breakers
[1:34:48] to flip the different appliances so I
[1:34:50] went downstairs with a candle and it was
[1:34:53] a really terrible
[1:34:54] idea but I went downstairs I went into
[1:34:57] the old basement and there's two steps
[1:34:59] two concrete steps up and the breaker
[1:35:02] box is right on the top which is they
[1:35:04] like really poor planning but sorry
[1:35:06] honey yeah so anyways I'm holding this
[1:35:10] candle this glass candle and I turned to
[1:35:14] the breaker box I flipped on the
[1:35:16] freezers which were upstairs so I turned
[1:35:20] to hear if they came on and when I
[1:35:21] turned I lost my balance
[1:35:24] and I fell and all I could think about
[1:35:26] is I have to hold on to this candle cuz
[1:35:28] I don't want to burn the house down you
[1:35:30] know so I held onto the candle and I
[1:35:33] heard the bones crack when I fell I
[1:35:36] broke my ankle and my leg so then I had
[1:35:40] to crawl through the old basement the
[1:35:42] new basement up the stairs and my by the
[1:35:45] time I got to the top my ankle was like
[1:35:48] this and called Jen had to go and
[1:35:51] anyways three surgeries and two years
[1:35:53] later
[1:35:54] my ankle was repaired but that first
[1:35:58] golf outing was late in September this
[1:36:01] was in July so I literally cooked steaks
[1:36:03] on crutches Marty you didn't you weren't
[1:36:06] available
[1:36:07] yet so I literally was cooking the
[1:36:10] steaks for the golf outing while I was
[1:36:11] still on
[1:36:12] crutches that was the Lord when that
[1:36:16] happened immediately when it happened
[1:36:19] and I don't know if this happens to you
[1:36:22] but whenever anything happened
[1:36:24] I immediately Wonder did I do something
[1:36:26] wrong yeah did did I do something to you
[1:36:30] know the Lord was not pleased and I
[1:36:32] broke my leg and the Lord had spoken to
[1:36:35] me in a prophecy and told me that the
[1:36:38] reason it happened was the devil was mad
[1:36:41] about what we were doing for Missions
[1:36:44] and I thought why didn't he break John's
[1:36:46] leg why do I have to go through all
[1:36:49] this's IDE it was your idea so
[1:36:54] anyways
[1:36:56] so we went to the mission field for the
[1:37:00] first time in
[1:37:02] 2001 and I've heard people say oh it'll
[1:37:05] change your life it'll you know make you
[1:37:08] live different it doesn't I have found
[1:37:11] that it either reinforces a burden that
[1:37:13] you already have in your heart or when
[1:37:16] you come back you'll just go right back
[1:37:18] to life you know you forget the
[1:37:21] hardships over there
[1:37:24] and the first time we went I literally
[1:37:26] had no expectations nobody warned me you
[1:37:30] know it
[1:37:31] was John likeed to go to the most remote
[1:37:34] areas that exist on the
[1:37:37] planet
[1:37:38] and I mean I remember driving down there
[1:37:42] and my head hit the top of the truck so
[1:37:45] many times I asked if we could ride
[1:37:48] horses the next time you know it was so
[1:37:51] incredibly the roads believe it or not
[1:37:53] there's wordss roads are worse than
[1:37:56] Michigan if you can believe that there's
[1:37:59] no traffic rules everybody just drives
[1:38:03] and um they want to turn around go the
[1:38:04] other way they just go across the median
[1:38:07] they don't stop at red lights they don't
[1:38:09] they the horns I thought I was going to
[1:38:11] have PTSD when I got back from the
[1:38:12] beeping horns because every time they
[1:38:14] come to turn or pull in front of you
[1:38:17] they just beat their horn so it was
[1:38:20] pretty crazy I could never drive in
[1:38:22] Detroit until I went overseas now
[1:38:26] Detroit is great I don't have any
[1:38:29] problem um there's no hot water first
[1:38:32] time we went to a hotel I told John I
[1:38:34] think John Wayne had a shootout in here
[1:38:36] there's like holes like bullet holes in
[1:38:38] the walls and some of the areas we went
[1:38:43] to we supported the radio broadcasts and
[1:38:47] I always thought that was kind of
[1:38:48] pointless I'm just going to be honest
[1:38:50] you know I just thought have this man in
[1:38:53] in this room all by himself speaking
[1:38:56] into this mic and but you know when we
[1:38:58] went to these remote areas and you could
[1:39:00] see that you could not reach these areas
[1:39:03] it was so difficult the travel was so
[1:39:06] difficult and you started seeing these
[1:39:08] churches popping up in the middle of
[1:39:10] nowhere and you realize the benefit of
[1:39:13] those radio
[1:39:15] broadcasts and I know one time we went
[1:39:17] to this Indian village and we were told
[1:39:20] do not eat the food you will for sure
[1:39:23] get sick so we go up there and I'm
[1:39:25] watching brother Bill Sanchez and the
[1:39:28] other brothers they're eating like they
[1:39:30] never ate before and I'm like did they
[1:39:32] not get the memo we're not supposed to
[1:39:34] be eating this food it was in the the
[1:39:37] top of this mountain it was so difficult
[1:39:39] to get there
[1:39:41] and yeah so I couldn't even communicate
[1:39:44] with the dogs over there they only
[1:39:47] understand
[1:39:48] Spanish and I love dogs you know and
[1:39:51] they just looked at me like yeah we
[1:39:53] don't understand what you're saying the
[1:39:56] second time I went I felt like I was
[1:39:58] more prepared I took my beef jerky
[1:40:01] because didn't do the food very well
[1:40:03] they took it away from me at the airport
[1:40:05] they said that we have mad cow disease
[1:40:07] here in the states and I wasn't allowed
[1:40:09] to bring it there and their food is like
[1:40:11] horrendous so we
[1:40:14] started um going to gas stations to get
[1:40:18] food because you just go in there and
[1:40:20] you look for anything packaged in
[1:40:22] America and you're like I hate this food
[1:40:25] at home but as long as it said Pakistan
[1:40:27] America it was doable
[1:40:30] so um the one trip we took two of our
[1:40:33] daughters joy and
[1:40:35] Elizabeth and this was the scariest
[1:40:38] experience I have ever had in my life
[1:40:41] it's like it was like Cedar Point in
[1:40:43] slow motion we were going up the side of
[1:40:46] this mountain John chose to walk maybe
[1:40:49] that was a better idea I don't know but
[1:40:52] this truck we were riding and there was
[1:40:54] literally this much room left after the
[1:40:58] truck took up the road before it was
[1:41:00] like this huge thousands of feet drop
[1:41:03] off we were screaming me and Elizabeth
[1:41:07] and joy we were just screaming driving
[1:41:10] with this person that doesn't speak
[1:41:11] English and it was just like the worst
[1:41:15] so we finally get to the top and I was
[1:41:17] like oh thank goodness we didn't die and
[1:41:20] then we had to walk across this bridge
[1:41:22] that was a swinging bridge and that was
[1:41:24] terrifying we get to the other side and
[1:41:27] we go to these people's house and they
[1:41:29] wanted us to eat and joy was so hungry
[1:41:31] she started eating I said Joy there's
[1:41:33] bugs in that she's like Mom I don't care
[1:41:35] I'm hungry and I was just like I'm not
[1:41:38] hungry I can't do
[1:41:41] this you can't go over there without
[1:41:43] getting sick that's like something you
[1:41:46] do and I remember one night it was
[1:41:49] before church and the church was on the
[1:41:51] side of a mountain and I just remember
[1:41:53] my my stomach was just churning and just
[1:41:56] looking across the mountains and that
[1:41:58] scripture came to me that I look to the
[1:42:00] hills once from Once cometh my help and
[1:42:02] I said Lord please just calm my stomach
[1:42:04] I don't even know where the bathroom is
[1:42:06] at it's just it was it was hard at times
[1:42:11] to you know stomach the
[1:42:14] food um when you're there you start to
[1:42:17] to Really witness the Simplicity of God
[1:42:19] there's no
[1:42:20] distractions they don't have anything
[1:42:23] you know you go in their house they have
[1:42:24] a dirt floor and and um you know a lot
[1:42:28] of them don't have refrigeration or
[1:42:30] anything and and they treat you like
[1:42:33] royalty you feel like this big cuz they
[1:42:37] will give you anything they have they
[1:42:39] just want you we went to so many places
[1:42:41] that said we've never had we've never
[1:42:44] seen an American before you know and
[1:42:46] they just treated you and it just
[1:42:48] humbles you you know and you realize
[1:42:50] these are God's children amen and we're
[1:42:53] all going to you know have the same
[1:42:55] reward when it's when it's
[1:42:57] over and I remember driving home one
[1:43:01] night
[1:43:02] and we would drive for hours on those
[1:43:05] scary roads through the mountains and I
[1:43:08] was just thinking of myself I said Lord
[1:43:10] I just I wish I had a million dollars I
[1:43:12] could just meet all these needs these
[1:43:14] people have so many needs and something
[1:43:17] just told me the gospel that we were
[1:43:20] bringing that was greater riches that
[1:43:23] provided everything they needed and you
[1:43:27] know it was worth all the struggles
[1:43:31] and you know there was uh a language
[1:43:34] barrier of course you know John and I
[1:43:36] did a lot
[1:43:38] of talking with our hands describing
[1:43:41] things you know cornflakes come with hot
[1:43:45] milk so we had to try to figure that out
[1:43:48] and U at times we were without an
[1:43:50] interpreter and
[1:43:53] and um the language barrier was was hard
[1:43:56] because you know obviously we don't
[1:43:58] speak Spanish but but you know the love
[1:44:01] of God is the same in every language and
[1:44:03] we all have the same father and you
[1:44:06] could feel so connected to different
[1:44:09] people that you never met before but you
[1:44:12] know because we share that the blood of
[1:44:15] Jesus we we could you know be the
[1:44:19] same um I I just
[1:44:23] you know
[1:44:25] somebody those were some of the things
[1:44:27] that we experienced overseas and and it
[1:44:30] was you know a time that you know I'm
[1:44:33] glad I got to go and experience those
[1:44:35] things but today you know we're in a
[1:44:38] different place
[1:44:40] and the mission mission starts right
[1:44:43] outside those doors and I just want to
[1:44:49] encourage you
[1:44:51] that you know God can speak through a
[1:44:54] donkey he can he can help any one of us
[1:44:57] to reach somebody it's just like I said
[1:45:01] missions is the heart of God if you
[1:45:04] really really want to please the Lord
[1:45:06] missions is where you do that
[1:45:11] and um there's a scripture about just a
[1:45:15] cup of cold water you know given in his
[1:45:17] name will have its
[1:45:19] reward and I believe that every one of
[1:45:21] us are capable of that and I just want
[1:45:24] to encourage you today to pray about
[1:45:26] what God would have you to do to reach
[1:45:29] out to somebody to do something for
[1:45:31] Missions you know you don't have to send
[1:45:34] a semi overseas or something but just
[1:45:38] to you're capable of doing something and
[1:45:42] just to find that you know that place
[1:45:44] where God wants you to be in his
[1:45:48] kingdom so that's that's pretty much
[1:45:51] it
