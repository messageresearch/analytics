[37:09] amen going to read one scripture while
[37:11] you're
[37:12] standing
[37:13] and then we'll have you be seated i want
[37:14] to show some
[37:16] some pictures
[37:17] of uh in the philippines
[37:20] but we're gonna turn to deuteronomy
[37:22] chapter 30 and read just one verse there
[37:25] that's verse number 19.
[37:36] the scripture reads i call to heaven and
[37:39] earth
[37:40] i call heaven and earth to record this
[37:43] day
[37:45] against you
[37:47] that i have set before you life and
[37:49] death blessing and cursing
[37:52] therefore choose life
[37:54] that both thou and thy seed
[37:57] may live
[37:58] man god bless you you may be seated
[38:01] we're entitling this message
[38:03] the power of choice
[38:05] the power of choice and for a subject
[38:08] choosing life but before we get into uh
[38:11] these scriptures um i just wanted to
[38:14] show
[38:14] some pictures that came to us from
[38:16] sister
[38:17] chi-chi as you know brother rowell had
[38:19] passed away and she's kind of been uh
[38:23] filling in until the the pastor gets
[38:26] settled right now he's really
[38:28] concentrating on the church and and not
[38:31] as much on missions but her sister is in
[38:34] contact with the believers there
[38:36] and brother jackie benton has been a
[38:39] tremendous help in giving thousands of
[38:41] dollars to help with this but our our
[38:44] church did as well and they just wanted
[38:46] to go through these pictures kind of
[38:48] quick this is
[38:49] when the typhoon came and just destroyed
[38:51] many houses
[38:53] and as you can see uh they're
[38:56] they're not much of a house to start
[38:58] with
[38:59] and so when the storm comes it can
[39:02] really do a lot of damage and here you
[39:04] see they're starting to build with the
[39:05] money that you gave
[39:07] and the the and through your prayers
[39:10] that you prayed for when you were
[39:11] praying for
[39:13] the needs in the philippines
[39:18] and these are just a number of families
[39:20] and a number of pastors
[39:22] um
[39:24] were affected
[39:26] and uh you know brother
[39:28] our brother mark was just talking about
[39:30] our church and the blessings that we
[39:32] have and you know the the homes that we
[39:34] live in the these um
[39:37] these these uh precious people our
[39:39] brothers and sisters in christ don't
[39:42] have you know what we have and the least
[39:44] we could do is you know pray for them
[39:46] and and hold them up in prayer and just
[39:49] just help the the best that we can
[39:52] remember when jesus was talking he said
[39:55] what you've done to the least of these
[39:57] little ones you've done it unto me
[39:59] and and and
[40:01] we
[40:02] they're
[40:03] very important amen amen praise the lord
[40:07] so let's continue to hold up the
[40:10] the saints in the philippines who will
[40:13] be affected for for quite some time and
[40:16] yes and
[40:17] the
[40:18] in in ukraine that the great needs that
[40:20] are
[40:21] uh for the believers there and well we
[40:24] just have to pray for one another and
[40:25] i'll say it like this we can't stop the
[40:28] end from coming
[40:30] the best thing we could do
[40:32] is number one make sure we're ready
[40:35] number two get a soul in
[40:38] because nothing else after that that
[40:40] matters
[40:41] i'd like to go ahead and just start with
[40:43] this chapter 30 if you would like to
[40:45] read with me starting with verse number
[40:47] one
[40:49] of deuteronomy chapter 30 and it shall
[40:52] come to pass when all these things are
[40:54] come upon thee the blessings
[40:57] and the blessing and the curse which i
[41:00] have set before thee
[41:02] and thou shalt call them to mine among
[41:04] all the nations whether the lord thy god
[41:07] have driven thee
[41:09] and shall return unto the lord thy god
[41:11] and shall obey his voice according to
[41:13] all that i command thee this day thou
[41:15] and thy children with all thy heart and
[41:17] with all thy soul
[41:19] that then the lord thy god will turn
[41:22] thee
[41:23] turn thy captivity
[41:25] and have compassion upon thee and will
[41:28] return and gather thee from all the
[41:30] nations whether the lord thy god have
[41:32] scattered thee if
[41:35] if any of thine be driven out unto the
[41:38] uttermost parts of heaven from hence
[41:39] will the lord thy god gather thee from
[41:42] the thence will he fetch thee and the
[41:44] lord thy god will bring thee into the
[41:46] land which thy fathers possess and thou
[41:49] shalt possess it and he would do
[41:51] the good and multiply thee above thy
[41:55] fathers and the lord thy god will
[41:57] circumcise thy heart
[42:00] and the heart of thy seed
[42:02] what and what will be circumcised too
[42:05] to love the lord thy god with all that
[42:08] heart with all they sow with all thy
[42:10] that thou mayest live so
[42:13] we were born with just a terrible nature
[42:17] even though everybody that we liked
[42:19] being around told us we were good but we
[42:21] know our nature was was corrupt and when
[42:25] we come to church we come to church we
[42:27] want to be circumcised right we and and
[42:31] there needs to be nothing left in our
[42:33] life but just a love for god
[42:37] and the lord thy god will put all these
[42:40] curses upon
[42:42] thine enemies
[42:43] and on them that hate thee which
[42:46] persecute thee and thou shall return and
[42:49] obey the voice of the lord and do all
[42:51] his commandments which i command thee
[42:52] this day and the lord thy god will make
[42:55] thee plenteous in every work of thine
[42:57] hand and in the fruit of the body and
[42:59] the fruit of thy cattle and in the fruit
[43:01] of thy land for good
[43:03] for the lord will again rejoice over
[43:06] thee for good as as he rejoiced over our
[43:10] father so you know the children of
[43:12] israel went through a terrible terrible
[43:15] time in the wilderness and now he's he's
[43:17] he's trying to give them uh warnings and
[43:21] tell them well first blessings of what
[43:23] he'll do if they follow in them and then
[43:26] a warning if they don't verse 10 if thou
[43:29] shall hearken unto the voice of the lord
[43:31] thy god
[43:32] to keep his commandments and his
[43:34] statutes which are written in the book
[43:36] of the law and if thou turn unto the
[43:38] lord thy god with all their heart and
[43:40] with all thy soul
[43:43] so we've got to give god everything we
[43:45] just we can't we got to get away from
[43:47] any thinking that god only needs just a
[43:50] part of us and we can move forward with
[43:51] god it just it does doesn't work
[43:55] for this commandment which i command
[43:57] thee this day it is not hidden from thee
[44:00] neither is it far off it is not in
[44:03] heaven that thou should say who shall go
[44:06] up for us into heaven and bring it unto
[44:08] us that we may hear it and do it neither
[44:11] is it beyond the sea that thou should
[44:14] say who shall go over the sea for us and
[44:17] bring it unto us that we may hear it and
[44:19] do it but the word is very nigh unto
[44:24] thee
[44:25] in thy mouth and in thy heart that thou
[44:28] mayest do it
[44:30] always about obeying
[44:32] so i have set before thee this day life
[44:36] and good death and evil
[44:38] and that i command thee this day to love
[44:42] the lord thy god to walk in his ways and
[44:45] to keep his commandments and his
[44:46] statutes and his judgments that thou
[44:48] mayest live and multiply and the lord
[44:51] thy god shall bless you in the land
[44:53] whether thou whether thou goest to
[44:55] possess it but if thine heart
[44:58] turn
[44:59] away
[45:01] so that thou will not hear
[45:03] but shall be drawn away
[45:06] and worship other gods and and serve
[45:09] them
[45:10] i denounce unto you this day that he
[45:14] shall surely perish
[45:16] and that ye shall not prolong your days
[45:18] upon the land whether thou passes over
[45:21] jordan to go possess it i call to heaven
[45:24] i call heaven and earth to record
[45:28] this day against you that i have set
[45:30] before you life and death blessing and
[45:33] cursing therefore
[45:35] choose life
[45:36] that
[45:37] both thou and thy seed
[45:40] may live it's for our children amen
[45:43] thou that one more verse that thou
[45:45] mayest love the lord thy god and that
[45:48] thou mayest obey his voice and that thou
[45:51] mayest cleave unto him for he is thy
[45:53] life
[45:54] and the length of thy days that thou
[45:56] mayest dwell in the land
[45:59] which the lord swear unto thy fathers to
[46:01] abraham to isaac to jacob to give
[46:04] to them
[46:06] it's
[46:09] so powerful that god has god gave them
[46:12] the land
[46:13] just gave it to them amen
[46:15] they didn't really
[46:17] have to
[46:18] do anything in their own ability except
[46:21] trust god to believe
[46:23] and that god would take care of it
[46:26] now part of possessing the land is
[46:29] obeying the word of god
[46:31] it's so tied in here in the old
[46:33] testament we could say we cannot possess
[46:36] the promised land unless we obey
[46:39] the bible says he gives the holy ghost
[46:41] to them that obeys him so this is is
[46:43] really really important
[46:45] i want to talk about the power of choice
[46:47] today choice
[46:49] can seem insignificant
[46:51] with a carnal mind or a natural mind
[46:54] that is looking at predestination
[46:58] right if we're if we're predestinated
[47:00] what is there to choose and i'm just
[47:03] going to give some scriptures to kind of
[47:04] help fortify that thought right now and
[47:07] it's ephesians 1 5. we have been
[47:09] predestinated to be adopted into god's
[47:12] family to fulfill the pleasure of god's
[47:16] will now you write that down another one
[47:18] is a ephesians 1 verse 11 we are
[47:20] predestined to fulfill god's purpose who
[47:23] worketh
[47:24] who worketh everything after the council
[47:27] of his own
[47:28] will
[47:29] so we see that we've been predestined to
[47:32] to adoption to be in god's family
[47:35] and to fulfill his purpose
[47:37] so so what does the power of choice have
[47:40] to do with us
[47:43] but during peter's sermon on the day of
[47:45] pentecost acts 20 acts 2 verse 22 he's
[47:49] speaking here and he says she men
[47:52] of israel hear these words jesus of
[47:54] nazareth the man approved of god among
[47:57] you by miracles and wonders and signs
[47:59] which god did by him in the midst of you
[48:01] as you know as you as ye yourselves also
[48:05] know him
[48:06] being delivered
[48:09] by the determined
[48:11] counsel and foreknowledge of god
[48:14] you have taken him and by wicked hands
[48:17] have crucified
[48:19] and slained
[48:24] well
[48:26] peter
[48:28] has a revelation now it was the
[48:31] determined counsel and foreknowledge of
[48:34] god that this was even going to happen
[48:37] the bible tells us that jesus christ was
[48:40] actually crucified before the foundation
[48:43] of the world
[48:45] but yet he still had to surrender his
[48:48] will
[48:50] peter can say i i know i know this now
[48:53] because jesus he kept telling us that he
[48:56] was going to be slain
[48:58] even i resisted it and and fought it
[49:03] the bible says here by the determined
[49:05] counsel that means the marking out of
[49:08] god's purpose
[49:10] and the foreknowledge is just simply the
[49:12] forethought god could
[49:14] god
[49:15] knows what's going to happen
[49:18] before it happens
[49:20] and so
[49:22] these things were predestinated
[49:26] jesus was predestined to fulfill god's
[49:29] will
[49:30] but it could not happen unless it came
[49:33] to the power of choice and free more
[49:35] agency
[49:36] this is so important for us
[49:39] to understand to get a better balance in
[49:42] predestination
[49:44] first peter chapter one verse two the
[49:46] bible says we're the elect
[49:48] according to foreknowledge of god the
[49:51] father
[49:52] through sanctification of the spirit and
[49:55] unto obedience and the sprinkling of the
[49:57] of the blood of jesus christ grace unto
[50:00] you and peace be multiplied
[50:03] now notice we're elect to the
[50:06] foreknowledge of god but how does it
[50:08] happen it happens through sanctification
[50:12] in other words you repent you become
[50:14] sanctified
[50:16] the blood of jesus christ cleanses you
[50:19] it's through the power of choice
[50:23] i choose to walk in obedience to god's
[50:26] will that the life that i'm living the
[50:28] things that i'm doing i need to
[50:30] circumcise my heart
[50:32] it's through this process that the elect
[50:34] become who they are
[50:37] satan would love nothing better for us
[50:39] just to believe we're predestined and do
[50:41] nothing
[50:43] it's a deception
[50:46] our choices have everything to do where
[50:48] we're going to end up
[50:52] there's more to the power of our choices
[50:55] than what we realize
[51:01] even though we've been predestinated
[51:02] eternal life we still have to choose
[51:06] life we have to choose and it's not just
[51:09] a one-shot deal when we get baptized or
[51:11] we we first come to the lord amen
[51:15] now
[51:16] god is not a manipulator
[51:19] he's not a dictator
[51:22] even though his kingdom is not ruled by
[51:25] democracy
[51:27] he's still not
[51:28] a manipulator he doesn't manipulate his
[51:32] will upon us
[51:34] god is created within each one of us
[51:37] free will
[51:39] it's an agency that is controlled by our
[51:43] choice or the choice of the individual
[51:45] it's not his
[51:50] doesn't control our will
[51:52] how many times have you wished
[51:54] your children would just listen to you
[51:57] it is my will that you listen
[52:00] but they have their own will
[52:02] it's no different with us and god
[52:06] the angels were created with free will
[52:09] i've often said this that god doesn't
[52:11] have any robots in heaven
[52:14] just those who would love him enough
[52:17] to choose to be there
[52:21] look at jude chapter 1 verse 5
[52:24] it says i will therefore put you in
[52:25] remembrance though ye once knew this
[52:28] that
[52:29] how that the lord having saved the
[52:31] people of the land of egypt
[52:33] afterwards he destroyed them that
[52:35] believed not
[52:38] they they had a choice
[52:40] they chose not to believe
[52:43] that's why he destroyed them
[52:45] they did not choose life they did not
[52:47] choose the words of life
[52:52] they did not choose the tree of life
[52:57] what did their free will choose they
[53:00] chose
[53:01] the tree
[53:02] of knowledge
[53:07] and that tree of knowledge will always
[53:09] give you reasoning why you don't have to
[53:11] obey the word
[53:14] but it will always bring forth death in
[53:17] our lives
[53:18] now to them it was a natural death that
[53:20] it brought well jesus did say
[53:23] that they were eternally separated
[53:26] but to us we have to understand there's
[53:28] a spiritual death around
[53:33] it comes from partaking of the wrong
[53:35] tree amen verse six and the angels look
[53:38] at this even the angels which kept not
[53:41] their first estate but left their own
[53:44] inhabitation
[53:45] he have reserved them in everlasting
[53:47] chains
[53:48] under darkness unto the judgment of the
[53:51] great day
[53:53] why didn't they choose to stay with the
[53:56] other angels why did these angels leave
[54:00] god gave them free will to do what they
[54:02] wanted to do
[54:05] lucifer deceived
[54:08] his
[54:09] third of the angels
[54:11] to exercise their will
[54:13] above god's will
[54:16] and we're born with a nature that we're
[54:18] not even taught that by our parents
[54:21] in fact when our parents tell us to do
[54:23] something we actually want to do what we
[54:25] want to do
[54:26] so we were born unfortunately with this
[54:29] nature that is just like the nature that
[54:32] satan
[54:34] has
[54:39] makes it hard for us to make the right
[54:41] decisions when our whole flesh is just
[54:43] lusting after the wrong things
[54:47] they had power to choose but did not
[54:50] have character to choose the right thing
[54:55] that's right brother brahm said power
[54:57] without character is satanic they had
[55:00] power lucifer had power he convinced
[55:03] angels i see brother mark he's up here
[55:06] what is he doing he's trying to create
[55:08] an atmosphere and convince us all to
[55:11] enter into worship and worship the lord
[55:13] of lords and king of kings that's power
[55:16] with character
[55:18] amen amen now getting up here and and
[55:21] and creating an environment to say look
[55:23] at me
[55:25] is power without character
[55:28] and elvis presley had great ability
[55:33] but i can listen to those blue suede
[55:35] shoes and
[55:37] all those songs and they don't feel
[55:39] jesus
[55:45] god gives power
[55:47] to choose other than his will
[55:55] our choices
[55:57] are not necessarily
[55:59] always right are they
[56:03] but he gives us that ability
[56:07] god's kingdom is not manipulated
[56:12] it's love-driven
[56:13] it's i wanna be there the only people
[56:16] are going to be in heaven are those that
[56:18] want to be there and those are the ones
[56:20] that are predestinated
[56:21] they're going to want to be there so bad
[56:23] that they're willing to give up their
[56:25] will
[56:28] that's why brother brahms could say
[56:30] nothing but perfect love would enter in
[56:32] there
[56:34] man has got to fall in love with god so
[56:36] much that man would deny that satanic
[56:39] nature of his own will to go after what
[56:42] it wants to go after
[56:44] [Music]
[56:45] on if i had a dollar
[56:48] for
[56:49] every time my flesh
[56:52] wanted
[56:54] something different than god's will from
[56:56] the time that i got baptized i could buy
[56:58] all the houses on this street
[57:02] it's it's a nature it's still there
[57:05] if it wasn't going to be there jesus
[57:07] would never say you got to deny your
[57:09] flesh
[57:10] daily but there's a purpose you got to
[57:14] and i think every day you do it we look
[57:16] at oh man oh man but god's saying
[57:18] they're going to show me they love me
[57:20] they're showing me their love me today
[57:23] it's the only way we can do it
[57:27] it's an honor
[57:28] amen
[57:30] primal agency is exercised throughout
[57:32] god's kingdom right
[57:35] in other words all the angels the
[57:37] seraphims and the cherubians
[57:39] they all have a choice
[57:41] and they're choosing to do what they
[57:43] want to do
[57:44] do you ever think about that i mean i
[57:46] know when i used to think about heaven i
[57:48] would think about oh we he created these
[57:50] little robots to always say holy holy
[57:53] holy
[57:55] not soul
[57:59] i just i when i look at the character of
[58:01] god i don't think i see god making
[58:03] anybody do anything
[58:05] if he was like that
[58:07] he would have just annihilated lucifer
[58:09] and all the angels right off the bat
[58:13] he'll use them for his glory
[58:15] he is using the devil for his glory
[58:19] yes
[58:21] now the bible tells us that we're saved
[58:24] by grace
[58:26] through faith
[58:28] it's through the choice of believing
[58:31] that god truly provided a way for us see
[58:34] it's free more agency there's enough
[58:37] grace
[58:39] to save the world
[58:40] there's enough blood to cover the world
[58:43] but if you don't believe it it won't do
[58:45] you any good you've got to choose to
[58:47] believe
[58:49] and there's power
[58:50] in choices
[58:51] in our choices
[58:53] god is set before everyone life and
[58:56] death
[58:57] blessing and cursing
[58:59] and he says therefore choose life
[59:02] that both now and thy seed may love
[59:04] you've got to choose it don't rely on
[59:06] predestination friend
[59:09] i'll tell you that has got us in more
[59:10] trouble than it's ever helped us
[59:13] i'm not saying that there's hasn't been
[59:15] times we've been down in the dumps and
[59:17] we and we just you know god spoke
[59:21] no matter what you're predestined i'm
[59:23] not saying that doesn't happen but the
[59:25] devil uses it a billion times more to
[59:28] get us to not do anything that we should
[59:30] be doing
[59:32] right
[59:36] it's not a very popular
[59:38] opinion or statement but it's what i
[59:40] believe
[59:42] there's a reason brother branham said to
[59:44] stay away from it and of course you see
[59:47] i don't stay away from it
[59:49] but i am trying
[59:51] to bring us an understanding and a
[59:53] balance so we never have to be afraid
[59:56] and we and we don't get tricked by the
[59:57] devil
[1:00:00] now moses
[1:00:01] here he wasn't sharing his opinion with
[1:00:03] the believers
[1:00:05] right he wasn't
[1:00:07] this was a a life and death situation
[1:00:11] brother branham said when sometimes he
[1:00:13] would he would read just one verse of
[1:00:15] scriptures and he would say now you
[1:00:17] don't think there's much to what i just
[1:00:19] read but he said there's enough power in
[1:00:22] that one little bit of scripture to uh
[1:00:25] put you in heaven or condemn you in hell
[1:00:30] just through the power of choicing
[1:00:32] choosing to believe it or not amen
[1:00:35] and so here it was moses
[1:00:38] it was a life-and-death situation for
[1:00:40] the children of israel
[1:00:42] and moses called
[1:00:44] to every
[1:00:46] moment in time
[1:00:48] to just stop everything in heaven just
[1:00:52] pay attention to what's going to be
[1:00:54] happening here right now
[1:00:58] wow it was serious
[1:00:59] i call heaven and earth to record this
[1:01:02] day against you
[1:01:05] in other words i have set before you
[1:01:07] life
[1:01:08] and death it's a frimo agency you choose
[1:01:11] which way you want to go blessings are
[1:01:14] cursing he says
[1:01:16] therefore choose life
[1:01:18] god has always got his hand reached out
[1:01:21] saying choose
[1:01:22] life that both thou and thy seed may
[1:01:26] live
[1:01:28] it was really no different at the
[1:01:29] beginning of the creation of god in in
[1:01:32] genesis chapter 2. if you want to turn
[1:01:35] with me there
[1:01:37] god had put man in the middle of choice
[1:01:40] from the very beginning
[1:01:43] and the reason for this and this is an
[1:01:45] important reason that you understand it
[1:01:46] because we're in it today is because god
[1:01:50] wanted man to choose to serve him
[1:01:53] above everything else
[1:01:56] and there's nothing more powerful than
[1:01:57] the devil
[1:01:59] outside of god there's nothing more
[1:02:01] powerful outside of god than the devil
[1:02:07] think about it the devil has deceived
[1:02:10] the whole world he deceived us why is it
[1:02:12] all of our family and all of our loved
[1:02:14] ones and all of our friends and
[1:02:15] everybody we talk to why aren't they
[1:02:17] saved because of the power of the devil
[1:02:21] he deceiveth the whole world the bible
[1:02:23] says he's blinded the minds of them that
[1:02:25] believe now who choose not to believe
[1:02:27] the word is true
[1:02:30] he's powerful
[1:02:33] he trips us up all the time
[1:02:38] genesis 2 verse 8 and the lord god
[1:02:40] planted a garden east
[1:02:42] eastward in eden and there he put the
[1:02:44] man whom he had formed
[1:02:47] and out of the ground made the lord god
[1:02:49] to grow every tree that is pleasant to
[1:02:51] sight and good for food the tree of life
[1:02:53] also in the midst of the garden and
[1:02:56] the tree of knowledge of good and evil
[1:02:58] verse 15 and the lord god took the man
[1:03:00] and he put a ray in the middle of the
[1:03:03] garden to address it
[1:03:05] to keep it
[1:03:06] uh like this god had given man a
[1:03:09] responsibility even before he fell
[1:03:12] right
[1:03:13] through to work
[1:03:14] and to guard
[1:03:16] god's creation before it fell
[1:03:19] after he fell he had to work harder
[1:03:22] he had to sweat more
[1:03:25] but he still
[1:03:26] created him and gave him a job
[1:03:29] there was no welfare
[1:03:33] but that wasn't the only responsibility
[1:03:36] that he gave man he also gave him the
[1:03:39] responsibility of keeping his
[1:03:41] commandments
[1:03:45] excuse me
[1:03:46] you know how often i take water
[1:03:52] excuse me
[1:03:58] somehow we got to erase it off the tape
[1:04:00] and
[1:04:03] verse 16 and the lord god commanded the
[1:04:06] men
[1:04:07] saying of every tree of the garden thou
[1:04:10] mayest freely eat but of the tree of the
[1:04:13] garden of good and evil thou shalt not
[1:04:17] eat of it for in the day that thou
[1:04:19] eatest thereof thou shall surely die
[1:04:24] so here god naturally puts all sorts of
[1:04:28] natural trees in the garden and he tells
[1:04:31] adam you can just eat of every one of
[1:04:33] those they're all good for you
[1:04:35] because everything that god created was
[1:04:37] good even when he created lucifer in the
[1:04:39] beginning he was perfect
[1:04:43] and i i believe
[1:04:45] everything that god ever created was was
[1:04:49] perfect
[1:04:50] god just doesn't do halfway jobs
[1:04:55] and so whatever choice you make
[1:04:57] for your body to eat
[1:05:00] it's going to be good for you
[1:05:03] but spiritually you can only eat of one
[1:05:05] tree
[1:05:08] because he was a uh he was a triune
[1:05:10] being
[1:05:12] he could only eat of the tree of life
[1:05:17] there's only one tree
[1:05:19] one will
[1:05:20] one way that will ever be good for us
[1:05:25] and that's the way of christ
[1:05:27] amen jesus christ was this tree in the
[1:05:30] garden
[1:05:32] jesus himself said man shall not live by
[1:05:35] bread alone
[1:05:36] but by every word that cometh forth from
[1:05:39] the tree of life
[1:05:42] he said my words are spirit
[1:05:45] and they are life
[1:05:49] jesus was that spiritual tree in the
[1:05:52] garden and that was all that they were
[1:05:55] allowed to eat from that's all they
[1:05:57] needed
[1:06:00] god had allowed another tree in the
[1:06:03] garden the tree of knowledge of good and
[1:06:05] evil
[1:06:07] and choosing to partake of that tree
[1:06:09] instead of life
[1:06:12] would have brought forth death it did
[1:06:14] bring forth death and today that tree is
[1:06:17] sitting here in church
[1:06:20] it's here
[1:06:22] it's in your home
[1:06:23] it's on the radio station it's at
[1:06:25] mcdonald's when you go there it's at tim
[1:06:27] hortons that says starbucks
[1:06:29] that tree of knowledge of good and evil
[1:06:32] it's everywhere
[1:06:34] it's in the midst of our lives
[1:06:38] but so is the tree of life
[1:06:42] now why would a a perfect god who had a
[1:06:45] perfect eden with a man in his own image
[1:06:48] put him in the midst of a mixed tree
[1:06:52] that was bad for you
[1:06:57] god put the tree of knowledge there in
[1:06:58] the garden for the purpose of proving
[1:07:01] the power of love
[1:07:04] proving the power of love and it's not
[1:07:06] just one way it's two ways
[1:07:09] wrong choices had to be made in the
[1:07:11] garden in order to prove or manifest the
[1:07:14] power of love if that would have never
[1:07:16] happened god would have never been able
[1:07:18] to say for god so loved the world that
[1:07:20] he gave his only begotten son
[1:07:22] it proved his love that tree had to be
[1:07:26] there and man had a fall that he could
[1:07:29] prove his love to mankind
[1:07:33] but remember it was through the power of
[1:07:36] god's choice
[1:07:38] through his free will
[1:07:41] that he he saved man
[1:07:45] everything in heaven is free moral
[1:07:49] agency it's choice
[1:07:51] this is important because if we get a
[1:07:53] real revelation of this we'll make
[1:07:55] better choices for our life
[1:07:57] we really will
[1:07:59] at the beginning man was commanded to
[1:08:01] not partake of the mixed tree
[1:08:05] in the middle jesus commanded them
[1:08:07] unless you partake of me the tree the
[1:08:10] bread of life
[1:08:11] drink of this water you have no life in
[1:08:14] you
[1:08:16] and then at the end
[1:08:17] in the last chapter he said whosoever
[1:08:19] will let him take of the water of life
[1:08:23] freely whosoever will
[1:08:26] the power of choice
[1:08:31] just trying to lay a foundation hope
[1:08:32] you're staying with me
[1:08:39] there's no
[1:08:40] greater
[1:08:42] manifestation or evidence
[1:08:46] of
[1:08:47] god's love than a man lay down his life
[1:08:50] for his friends
[1:08:52] nothing can prove
[1:08:55] any greater love
[1:08:57] in fact he wanted to say
[1:08:59] by proving this or manifesting this love
[1:09:02] shall all men know that you've been
[1:09:04] partaking of the tree of life
[1:09:08] that you're my disciples that you're
[1:09:10] you're you're doing the right thing
[1:09:14] in the message
[1:09:15] straight is the gate brother branham
[1:09:17] says you see when abraham was sitting
[1:09:19] under his tent
[1:09:21] because he had made a choice
[1:09:25] and that choice is brought before every
[1:09:27] person that's born in this world
[1:09:30] the tree of good and evil is set before
[1:09:33] every person
[1:09:35] and when lot his nephew and their
[1:09:38] herdsmen began to argue about the
[1:09:40] grounds abraham being a just man
[1:09:43] said to them
[1:09:44] let there be no arguments among us you
[1:09:46] choose your way of going
[1:09:50] the place comes to every believer's life
[1:09:53] and it's before you this morning and
[1:09:56] it's before me
[1:09:58] lot didn't think that he was going to
[1:10:00] backslide this is important when the
[1:10:02] devil
[1:10:03] tricks us into taking the easier way we
[1:10:06] think we got it handled we've got this
[1:10:09] temptation handled we think we can still
[1:10:11] stay with god remember that
[1:10:14] lot didn't think that he was going to
[1:10:16] backslide but he went
[1:10:18] but he went to looking towards sodom
[1:10:21] where things were easy
[1:10:23] and there's many times we look towards
[1:10:25] the easy way
[1:10:26] well i'll just uh join this certain
[1:10:28] certain church and and you see nobody
[1:10:31] will say anything against it because
[1:10:33] it's the biggest church in the city
[1:10:35] the easy way
[1:10:36] he says many times we do that when we're
[1:10:39] wrong
[1:10:41] remember
[1:10:42] if you follow christ
[1:10:44] you'll be hated by people
[1:10:47] for all that live godly in christ jesus
[1:10:50] shall suffer persecutions
[1:10:53] and if you come to christ you'll not
[1:10:55] come by any church or denomination or
[1:10:58] creed
[1:10:59] you'll come by the blood that's the only
[1:11:01] avenue in
[1:11:03] you cannot bring no one with you
[1:11:05] you come alone and you stand on your own
[1:11:08] confession and your own faith you'll not
[1:11:12] ride in on on the pastor
[1:11:14] or your mother's faith
[1:11:16] you'll come as an individual when you
[1:11:18] come to god and many times we make those
[1:11:21] foolish choices
[1:11:26] tree of good and evil is set before
[1:11:29] every person
[1:11:32] and god forces
[1:11:34] us to make a choice just like he did
[1:11:37] adam and eve it was no different
[1:11:40] we must make a choice
[1:11:44] we have the choice to either partake of
[1:11:46] the tree of life or look for the easy
[1:11:48] way
[1:11:49] and partake
[1:11:51] of the tree of good and evil now this
[1:11:54] tree of knowledge of good and evil it's
[1:11:56] a mixed tree
[1:11:58] i've
[1:11:59] tried to describe it as i could many
[1:12:02] times it has good and evil in the tree
[1:12:08] because if any of us would go to do good
[1:12:12] we've got to know it first
[1:12:18] hey if i'm going to help somebody if i'm
[1:12:20] going to pray for somebody if i'm going
[1:12:21] to lay down my life for somebody if i'm
[1:12:23] going to do something for somebody i've
[1:12:25] got to know it's the right thing to do
[1:12:29] but the knowledge of that without doing
[1:12:32] it is a mixed tree
[1:12:35] and when we know to do good but we're
[1:12:37] choosing not to do it we've got to
[1:12:39] understand that's not the tree of life
[1:12:42] that's the tree of knowledge that we're
[1:12:44] in the midst of right amen
[1:12:46] amen
[1:12:48] well what doesn't the bible says he
[1:12:49] that's a hearer of the word and not a
[1:12:51] doer deceiveth his own self
[1:12:55] it's a mixed tree it's right here it
[1:12:57] just wasn't in the garden
[1:13:00] it's when i'm driving down the road and
[1:13:02] the devil says it doesn't matter
[1:13:06] when the lord says you didn't pray
[1:13:09] today
[1:13:10] and you say i'll get it tomorrow what
[1:13:12] are you doing telling your father you
[1:13:14] don't have to do what he asks you to do
[1:13:17] it's a mixed tree
[1:13:19] and we got to see that satan we got to
[1:13:21] uncover satan that's what we got to do
[1:13:25] deuteronomy 6 5
[1:13:29] and thou shalt love the lord thy god
[1:13:33] with all thy heart
[1:13:35] with all thy soul with all thy might and
[1:13:37] these words which i command you this
[1:13:39] this day shall be in thine heart
[1:13:44] now this is you know we we could all sit
[1:13:46] here and intellectually say well none of
[1:13:48] us you know really love god that much
[1:13:50] but we just do our best to you know kind
[1:13:52] of press towards that's all we can do
[1:13:57] why in the world is it even written in
[1:13:59] the word
[1:14:02] we've got to hold ourselves accountable
[1:14:06] if we don't press into this image
[1:14:09] and expect god to take us
[1:14:12] merely on the blood
[1:14:13] but not on our choice
[1:14:16] amen on our choice not to circumcise our
[1:14:19] life anymore to to sanctify and to walk
[1:14:22] in the commandments of the lord
[1:14:26] we seen this
[1:14:28] what happened in the garden
[1:14:32] it
[1:14:33] having this tree in our midst
[1:14:35] now we have a chance to prove to god
[1:14:37] like he proved to us
[1:14:39] our love for him like he proved his love
[1:14:42] for us
[1:14:45] and brother branham talk about this is
[1:14:47] the only life that will have to really
[1:14:50] uh
[1:14:51] uh
[1:14:53] to to
[1:14:54] to to work for the lord and improve
[1:14:58] our our love for him
[1:15:00] in the in this in this some i'm
[1:15:02] paraphrasing that a little bit but
[1:15:06] listen when we get up in heaven there's
[1:15:08] not going to be any tears right
[1:15:11] no more crying
[1:15:13] it's going to be a eternally bliss
[1:15:17] so this is the the chance where we can
[1:15:20] turn away
[1:15:21] the the the the flesh that doesn't want
[1:15:24] to worship that doesn't want to serve
[1:15:26] that wasn't doesn't want to pray doesn't
[1:15:28] want to press it doesn't want to reach
[1:15:30] out we have a chance to say god i love
[1:15:32] you more than that today amen
[1:15:36] in the message time tested memorials of
[1:15:39] god brother brahm says you see a man's
[1:15:40] character
[1:15:42] is made known
[1:15:44] by his works and we're talking about
[1:15:45] proving
[1:15:47] whatever you are your works prove
[1:15:50] what you are
[1:15:51] no matter
[1:15:53] how much you testify
[1:15:55] whatever you say pro con that has
[1:15:58] nothing to do with it your works
[1:16:00] tell what you are
[1:16:03] tell us what's
[1:16:05] every job that you do manifests
[1:16:09] what you are
[1:16:11] and you businessman
[1:16:13] that would probably be like brother
[1:16:14] roger and i
[1:16:17] you businessman
[1:16:18] if you just do a patch up job
[1:16:21] see what i mean just a halfway job he
[1:16:24] says don't do that
[1:16:26] if you can't do it right don't do it at
[1:16:28] all
[1:16:32] i
[1:16:34] suppose brother jonathan he's a
[1:16:35] businessman too
[1:16:37] he's got a business
[1:16:39] brother says when you come to christ if
[1:16:41] you can't absolutely sell out lock stock
[1:16:44] and barrel and come to christ he says
[1:16:45] don't even come at all so we've got to
[1:16:48] believe the scripture love the lord thy
[1:16:50] god with all thy heart with all this
[1:16:51] soul with all they might or don't come
[1:16:53] at all
[1:16:54] jesus said i'd rather have you cold
[1:16:58] you don't want to get hot on fire for me
[1:16:59] i'd rather have you cold then don't be
[1:17:01] lukewarm
[1:17:05] but when you really want to be a
[1:17:06] christian stand out make it real
[1:17:09] that's what god wants you to be
[1:17:12] and that
[1:17:13] will prove
[1:17:14] your works will prove what your
[1:17:17] character is
[1:17:18] and your character is known by the works
[1:17:20] that you do see god is wanting us to
[1:17:24] prove our love for him
[1:17:27] i've set before thee life and death
[1:17:29] blessings and cursings therefore
[1:17:31] choose life
[1:17:34] that both thou and thy seed may live
[1:17:36] choose to love the lord thy god with all
[1:17:39] your heart
[1:17:41] choose to sell out lock stock and barrel
[1:17:44] because it don't happen because we're
[1:17:46] predestinated
[1:17:50] and you know
[1:17:53] how is god going to give you a
[1:17:55] revelation that your predestinated but
[1:17:58] he won't give you one to live for him
[1:18:03] he won't give you one to to die out
[1:18:05] daily he won't give you one to to keep
[1:18:08] all his commandments
[1:18:16] that's why it's a dangerous thought
[1:18:19] i'd rather hold myself accountable to
[1:18:21] this
[1:18:22] than just say i will not be moved i'm
[1:18:25] predestinated
[1:18:28] i won't be moved so much i don't even
[1:18:30] move for god
[1:18:32] you understand what i'm saying i know
[1:18:34] it's awful quiet and i'm not getting a
[1:18:36] lot of amens
[1:18:40] god has proven his love for us
[1:18:43] and now he wants us to prove our love
[1:18:47] for him amen
[1:18:48] every single day every opportunity amen
[1:18:52] what's amazing to me is even though the
[1:18:54] devil is more powerful than any human
[1:18:57] being
[1:18:58] if man through freemore agency chooses
[1:19:01] christ the word nothing can stand before
[1:19:05] him
[1:19:07] the power of a choice when you choose
[1:19:10] life not even the devil can get in your
[1:19:12] way
[1:19:14] that's why brother branham could say the
[1:19:16] the weakest christian when he's on his
[1:19:18] knees it makes the devil tremble
[1:19:22] if all you're doing is outside of christ
[1:19:24] and you're trying to do something
[1:19:27] you are an easy target for the devil
[1:19:31] you've got to choose christ not just
[1:19:33] choose that the devil's bad and i don't
[1:19:36] want the devil in my life and get him
[1:19:38] out of my home i'm sorry that only works
[1:19:40] so long after a while god's going to say
[1:19:42] you prove to me you prove to me that
[1:19:45] you're not serving other god you prove
[1:19:47] to me that you're taking my commandments
[1:19:49] [Music]
[1:19:52] he wants proof
[1:19:54] now we've all come short of the glory of
[1:19:56] god
[1:19:57] and i'll say it like this
[1:19:59] praise god
[1:20:01] for the blood
[1:20:02] it's all behind us
[1:20:04] but you know we make mistakes every day
[1:20:07] because we're in the middle
[1:20:09] because that tree is right there
[1:20:12] that's why we're making the that's why
[1:20:14] we take our eyes off of jesus
[1:20:18] right if we if we had more love we kept
[1:20:20] our eyes on jesus keep working for the
[1:20:22] lord think we wouldn't make as many
[1:20:24] mistakes don't you think that's a true
[1:20:26] statement
[1:20:27] well god that's what god is looking at
[1:20:29] god is looking for us to put forth the
[1:20:31] effort in our choices every day not
[1:20:34] stand behind some some message that says
[1:20:36] oh yeah i believe brother brown is a
[1:20:37] prophet he was a messenger for the hour
[1:20:39] and i believe the message that doesn't
[1:20:41] do anything brother friend himself says
[1:20:44] your works will prove what character you
[1:20:46] are and in what you say it's what you
[1:20:48] live
[1:20:51] and god is calling us
[1:20:53] to choose to live more for him
[1:20:56] choose to put him first choose to love
[1:20:59] them with all of our choose to give them
[1:21:01] more of our will
[1:21:04] the only one that can keep us out of
[1:21:06] heaven is us
[1:21:09] the only one that can keep us from our
[1:21:11] healing from our deliverance is us
[1:21:15] our unbelief
[1:21:17] we have to we must choose to believe
[1:21:20] all things are possible to those who
[1:21:23] choose to believe the word amen
[1:21:26] if you say to this mountain
[1:21:28] right
[1:21:30] don't expect somebody else to move it
[1:21:31] out of your life
[1:21:33] we're not babies anymore
[1:21:37] whatever you say in my name
[1:21:40] amen in my name you shall cast out every
[1:21:43] devil in your life
[1:21:45] i want to i'll tell you if there's ever
[1:21:46] a devil that i want i gone i want it
[1:21:49] gone for me
[1:21:51] so i can think straight live straight
[1:21:53] love god with everything
[1:21:57] hallelujah god wants us to take him at
[1:21:59] his word and to prove him yes
[1:22:04] it's all about relationship amen
[1:22:07] jesus has never failed his word has
[1:22:09] never failed
[1:22:11] he cannot lie
[1:22:13] his word will not return void
[1:22:16] he wants us to prove them
[1:22:18] if we're questioning approval
[1:22:22] malachi 3 10.
[1:22:24] we're not really
[1:22:26] talking about
[1:22:28] uh giving money in church right now but
[1:22:30] i just want to bring this to scripture
[1:22:32] bring ye all your tithes into the
[1:22:34] storehouse that there may be meat in my
[1:22:36] house
[1:22:38] and prove me now look at this and prove
[1:22:41] me
[1:22:42] now
[1:22:45] herewith saith the lord of hosts if i
[1:22:47] will not open
[1:22:50] you the windows of heaven and pour out a
[1:22:53] blessing that there shall not be room
[1:22:55] enough to receive it
[1:23:02] no one no one will be able to stand
[1:23:05] before god in heaven and say you did not
[1:23:10] follow your word you did not
[1:23:12] keep your word
[1:23:14] amen
[1:23:16] i believe the word amen
[1:23:24] take him at his word
[1:23:26] he's a rewarder to them that diligently
[1:23:28] seek him
[1:23:29] don't expect god to bless part-time
[1:23:32] seeking right
[1:23:33] part-time giving
[1:23:35] part-time faithfulness hey we gotta love
[1:23:37] them with everything we got
[1:23:40] it doesn't come with time
[1:23:44] you know a lot of believers are afraid
[1:23:45] to take god at his word they're afraid
[1:23:49] they're scared
[1:23:51] i don't want to give this up this is all
[1:23:53] i got
[1:23:54] ii timothy chapter 1 verse 7. drop these
[1:23:57] in
[1:23:58] at the end here for god have not given
[1:24:01] us the spirit of fear can you say amen
[1:24:05] cast them out
[1:24:07] but he's given us the spirit
[1:24:09] of power
[1:24:11] of love
[1:24:13] and a sound mind
[1:24:15] there's no confusion when you've got a
[1:24:17] sound mind
[1:24:18] that was kicked out
[1:24:21] but fear just brings confusion and i
[1:24:23] don't know what's going on that's the
[1:24:25] devil in your mind that's a that's a
[1:24:27] tree of knowledge of good and evil it's
[1:24:29] a mixed tree
[1:24:31] you got to kick it out
[1:24:34] all you've got to say is what this is
[1:24:35] not from god
[1:24:36] i'm an heir of god
[1:24:38] join heirs with christ
[1:24:40] he's given me love he's given me power
[1:24:42] he's giving me a sound mind and i'm
[1:24:44] standing on i'm making the choice get
[1:24:47] out
[1:24:49] first john chapter 4 verse 18. this is
[1:24:53] why fear so bad there is no
[1:24:56] fear
[1:24:57] in love
[1:25:01] but perfect love it casts out fear
[1:25:06] you know
[1:25:10] the more your love is perfect for christ
[1:25:15] the more you'll be able to cast out
[1:25:18] every lie
[1:25:20] in your life
[1:25:22] everything that comes to you
[1:25:24] and tries to bother you i love this
[1:25:28] there's no fear in love because perfect
[1:25:30] love cast out fear because
[1:25:32] fear hath torment
[1:25:36] and he that feareth is not made perfect
[1:25:41] in love amen
[1:25:43] we need more love that's the answer
[1:25:47] fall in love with jesus
[1:25:50] fall in love i love you jesus fill me
[1:25:52] with your love come on lord don't wait
[1:25:55] to the feelings there just start
[1:25:57] cultivating that love
[1:26:00] he's already did his part right how many
[1:26:02] you know he's not going to go to the
[1:26:03] cross for us every day
[1:26:06] once
[1:26:10] but his mercies are new each day
[1:26:13] he showers blessings upon us
[1:26:16] he's blessing us all the time we're just
[1:26:19] ignoring we don't look up to see where
[1:26:21] the apples are coming from
[1:26:24] right we got to take the time
[1:26:26] amen
[1:26:27] to worship god
[1:26:29] to thank him for the little things
[1:26:32] to thank him for the medium things
[1:26:36] to think of what he's doing for our
[1:26:37] brothers our sisters and all the things
[1:26:40] that before you know it the whole day's
[1:26:41] gone by and all you've done is thank the
[1:26:43] lord and i'll tell you'll be the
[1:26:45] happiest person in the world
[1:26:48] devil says man i gotta get out of here
[1:26:50] i gotta get out i can't stand this much
[1:26:52] talk about god
[1:26:55] in this message of expectation brother
[1:26:57] brandon said and there's only two
[1:26:59] elements in the world that controls the
[1:27:01] world tonight
[1:27:03] he said that's fear and faith
[1:27:06] russia is trying to do
[1:27:08] is russia is trying to get everybody to
[1:27:10] fear them
[1:27:13] and we're trying to get everybody to
[1:27:14] have faith in god
[1:27:16] he said now that's the difference
[1:27:18] the two elements control all nations it
[1:27:21] controls all people it controls all
[1:27:23] churches it controls all individuals is
[1:27:26] fear or
[1:27:28] faith
[1:27:31] you as much as we don't want to be
[1:27:33] bothered
[1:27:36] the only way fear is going to leave us
[1:27:37] is if we take a stand against it
[1:27:41] amen just fall in love with god and cast
[1:27:44] it out
[1:27:48] he says now fear has no valid valuation
[1:27:52] in it
[1:27:53] none whatsoever it's a perfectly endless
[1:27:56] it doesn't have one good thing about it
[1:28:01] brother brandon says if i was to be shot
[1:28:03] in the morning
[1:28:05] was going to be shot he said what good
[1:28:07] would it do to have fear
[1:28:10] it would do me no good at all
[1:28:15] you say well what good would faith do
[1:28:18] you
[1:28:19] brother branham says well faith could
[1:28:21] deliver me
[1:28:23] but fear won't help me a bit
[1:28:27] you just get yourself all worked up and
[1:28:30] all nervous and then when it comes time
[1:28:32] for the gun to fire
[1:28:35] he says
[1:28:36] so let's have faith
[1:28:39] faith could deliver you from that but if
[1:28:42] it doesn't
[1:28:43] what good would fear do anyhow
[1:28:46] just stay right with faith and hold on
[1:28:48] to it take god's promise and remind and
[1:28:52] remain with god remain with the word
[1:28:54] remain with the promise
[1:28:58] when we got this bible to look back at
[1:29:00] the the three hebrew children and and uh
[1:29:03] the fiery furnace and the daniel and the
[1:29:05] lion's den and everything that everybody
[1:29:08] went through
[1:29:11] god's a god of the last minute
[1:29:14] god will take us to the very end
[1:29:17] but the further he takes you
[1:29:20] the greater the glory when he delivers
[1:29:22] you
[1:29:24] he's a god of the last minute of course
[1:29:26] we wanted god to hey take care of this
[1:29:28] right now right now i don't want to go
[1:29:30] through you know
[1:29:32] put your faith in god stand the promise
[1:29:35] i just want to go back to first john
[1:29:37] chapter 4 and start at verse 16 and read
[1:29:39] through verse 20 if i could
[1:29:41] and when
[1:29:43] and we have known and believe the love
[1:29:46] that god has towards us
[1:29:48] god is love
[1:29:50] and he that dwelleth in love
[1:29:54] is actually dwelling in god
[1:29:57] and god in him
[1:30:00] herein is our love made perfect that we
[1:30:03] may have boldness in the day of judgment
[1:30:07] because as he is
[1:30:11] so are we in this world
[1:30:16] well he was perfect love
[1:30:21] you want to have boldness on the day of
[1:30:23] judgment perfect love
[1:30:27] fear fear
[1:30:28] fear will not be able to
[1:30:31] to give you any kind of boldness on the
[1:30:33] day of judgment
[1:30:34] there's no fear and love but perfect
[1:30:36] love casts out fear because fear have
[1:30:38] torment and he that feareth is not made
[1:30:40] perfect we love him
[1:30:43] we love him all because he first loved
[1:30:46] us
[1:30:48] he came into our heart he he saved us he
[1:30:51] showed us that he loved us
[1:30:54] and he filled us with himself giving us
[1:30:57] the ability to love him back
[1:31:01] with the same love he does it i you know
[1:31:03] as much as i
[1:31:06] i love sophie
[1:31:09] it's an animal
[1:31:11] we love our dogs
[1:31:14] we do
[1:31:17] awful quiet you're not going to stay
[1:31:18] with me that's fine i'll stand alone i'm
[1:31:21] used to it
[1:31:22] yes pastor's got to do that stuff
[1:31:26] but you know that love can't be compared
[1:31:28] that you have for your family
[1:31:31] it just can't be
[1:31:34] god doesn't want any dogs in heaven
[1:31:39] he wants somebody
[1:31:41] that he can love and that will love him
[1:31:43] back the same way amen
[1:31:46] are you with me
[1:31:48] now i do believe that there'll be dogs
[1:31:50] in heaven
[1:31:51] but you know what i'm saying
[1:31:54] god
[1:31:57] there there's
[1:31:58] really not a whole lot of scripture in
[1:32:00] the bible that
[1:32:02] talks in those lines of god
[1:32:06] wanting all those
[1:32:08] claiming predestinating but we are
[1:32:12] joiners with him
[1:32:14] of a special relationship and it's all
[1:32:16] based on love are you with me
[1:32:19] all right oh let me finish that verse
[1:32:21] 20. if a man say i love god
[1:32:24] and hate his brother he's a liar
[1:32:28] for he that loveth not his brother whom
[1:32:29] he have seen how can he love god who is
[1:32:31] not
[1:32:32] whom he have not seen
[1:32:37] love doesn't stop with god
[1:32:41] love is just for everybody
[1:32:44] the love of god is without respect to
[1:32:46] persons
[1:32:48] it just loves enemies whatever
[1:32:50] just love love love
[1:32:54] now
[1:32:55] we can't just say we believe
[1:32:58] we've got to believe with all of our
[1:32:59] heart
[1:33:01] and god is going to prove us to see if
[1:33:03] we believe or not
[1:33:05] now he's allowed the tree of knowledge
[1:33:07] of good and evil
[1:33:08] in our life
[1:33:10] and it ain't going anywhere
[1:33:15] you can put the thing at bay and just
[1:33:17] keep eating of the tree of life keep
[1:33:19] eating on the word keep listening to
[1:33:21] tapes keep obeying his word
[1:33:24] do the work of the lord always abounding
[1:33:27] in the work of the lord and that tree
[1:33:29] will stay at bay
[1:33:32] or you can say it not a big deal to me
[1:33:34] it's always going to be there and pretty
[1:33:36] soon that tree is going to trick you
[1:33:40] come on
[1:33:43] now here in
[1:33:45] exodus chapter 16 verse 3 the children
[1:33:48] of israel were choosing they made a
[1:33:50] choice
[1:33:51] to murmur against moses and really it
[1:33:54] was against god and the ministry
[1:33:57] he says and the children of israel said
[1:33:59] unto them would to god that we had died
[1:34:02] by the hand of the lord in the land of
[1:34:04] egypt can you imagine after they came
[1:34:06] out of egypt and they were dancing and
[1:34:08] everything
[1:34:10] he says but when we sat by the flesh
[1:34:12] pots and when we did eat bread to fo to
[1:34:15] the full for ye have brought us forth
[1:34:18] into this wilderness what kind of leader
[1:34:20] are you to kill this whole assembly with
[1:34:23] hunger
[1:34:29] then said the lord
[1:34:31] amen
[1:34:32] then said the lord
[1:34:34] unto moses
[1:34:36] behold i will reign bread from heaven
[1:34:38] for you
[1:34:39] and the people shall go out and gather a
[1:34:43] certain rate every day
[1:34:45] that i may prove them proven what
[1:34:49] whether they will walk in my law or no
[1:34:54] what does god god has done so much for
[1:34:57] me if he never did another thing and i
[1:34:59] lived for 30 years and it was totally
[1:35:01] miserable for my life i could never deny
[1:35:04] that god has not loved me and proven to
[1:35:07] me his great faithfulness to me he don't
[1:35:10] owe me anything
[1:35:13] amen today
[1:35:16] god
[1:35:17] consistently
[1:35:18] shows his faithfulness and love to us
[1:35:22] we must take
[1:35:23] the choice to prove that we love him
[1:35:26] back and it's hard
[1:35:30] deuteronomy 8 verse 1 all the
[1:35:32] commandments which i command you this
[1:35:34] day shall ye observe to do and
[1:35:36] that ye may live and multiply and go and
[1:35:39] possess the land which the lord swear
[1:35:41] unto your fathers and thou shalt
[1:35:43] remember all the way which the lord thy
[1:35:45] god led thee these forty years in the
[1:35:47] wilderness to what to humble thee yes
[1:35:52] why did they have to suffer like there's
[1:35:54] a little key right here to humble thee
[1:35:57] and to prove thee
[1:35:59] and to know what was in thine heart
[1:36:02] when thou wouldest keep
[1:36:05] whether thou wouldst keep his
[1:36:06] commandments or
[1:36:08] no
[1:36:11] we just you know god knows everything
[1:36:13] but he wants it approved
[1:36:16] choice
[1:36:18] jesus said if you love me
[1:36:20] keep my commandments
[1:36:21] prove it
[1:36:23] can i have just a little bit of time
[1:36:25] okay
[1:36:30] god has proven his great love for us
[1:36:33] to degree i'll i don't feel i'll ever
[1:36:35] comprehend
[1:36:37] god's love
[1:36:40] i i was a sinner
[1:36:44] which totally didn't even have god in my
[1:36:46] mind
[1:36:48] and i'd get little thoughts and then i'd
[1:36:50] get scared
[1:36:51] and even after i got saved i can't
[1:36:53] hardly look at one day in my life and
[1:36:56] feel that i haven't let them down
[1:36:59] so that might be my testimony my
[1:37:01] testimony alone but i'm sticking with
[1:37:05] so i'll never about to comprehend god
[1:37:08] having mercy on me every day
[1:37:10] god loving me every day deuteronomy
[1:37:13] chapter 7 verse 7 says the lord did not
[1:37:15] set his love upon you nor choose you
[1:37:17] because you were more in number than any
[1:37:19] people
[1:37:21] for you were the fewest of all people
[1:37:24] but because the lord loved you
[1:37:26] solid end of story don't try to figure
[1:37:29] it out god loved you
[1:37:32] that's why he is what he is in your life
[1:37:35] that's why he's calling you to heaven he
[1:37:37] just loves you
[1:37:41] and that's what you need to focus on
[1:37:42] towards him
[1:37:44] just love him just focus on it don't sit
[1:37:47] there and try to judge i've done enough
[1:37:49] i've gone to church i've read today i
[1:37:51] prayed today i've done this just fall in
[1:37:53] love and keep it going keep it pouring
[1:37:56] out why do you serve god i love him i
[1:37:59] love him because he first loved me
[1:38:05] and because he would keep the oath which
[1:38:07] he sworn unto your fathers have the lord
[1:38:10] brought you out of the mighty with a
[1:38:12] mighty hand and redeemed you out of the
[1:38:13] house of bondmen from the hand of
[1:38:15] pharaoh king of egypt know therefore
[1:38:18] that the lord thy god he is god the
[1:38:20] faithful god which keepeth covenant
[1:38:23] and mercy
[1:38:25] with them
[1:38:27] who not everybody
[1:38:29] with them that love him
[1:38:31] and keep his commandments
[1:38:33] even
[1:38:35] to
[1:38:36] 2000 or 2022
[1:38:40] to a thousand generations he will keep
[1:38:43] his
[1:38:44] covenant and his mercy with us
[1:38:47] if we love him and then keep his
[1:38:50] commandments this is why it's so
[1:38:52] important to understand is it's not
[1:38:54] about uh coming in and and learning how
[1:38:57] to be a good christian at church is is
[1:39:00] falling more in love with you when you
[1:39:02] come to church
[1:39:04] how you can serve them with all your
[1:39:05] heart
[1:39:06] it's a love affair
[1:39:09] psalms 91 verse 14 i'll really try to
[1:39:12] hurry if you just it's it's wednesday my
[1:39:14] excuse is it's it's a it's a bible study
[1:39:18] take a little bit longer
[1:39:20] because he have set his love upon me
[1:39:23] therefore while i deliver him how many
[1:39:25] wants deliverance
[1:39:27] set your love upon him
[1:39:28] set your love upon him
[1:39:30] i will set him on high because you have
[1:39:32] known my name he shall call me and i
[1:39:34] will answer him i will be with him in
[1:39:36] trouble and i will deliver him and i
[1:39:38] will even honor him because he have set
[1:39:41] his love upon me
[1:39:43] focus on the priority
[1:39:46] the priority is god wants you to prove
[1:39:49] his love
[1:39:51] make the choice
[1:39:53] to prove that you love him
[1:39:55] second corinthians chapter 8 verse 8 i
[1:39:57] speak not by commandment but by occasion
[1:40:00] of the forwardness of others and to
[1:40:02] prove
[1:40:03] the sincerity of your love how many
[1:40:05] times has somebody told you i love you
[1:40:09] and you doubted it
[1:40:14] oh you said that before
[1:40:16] we've all said it
[1:40:18] and failed so we're all guilty if i
[1:40:21] could say this
[1:40:24] but what we're looking for is some proof
[1:40:29] god wants us to prove
[1:40:32] god wants us to prove
[1:40:34] psalms 26 verse 2 examine me o lord and
[1:40:37] prove me and try my reigns and my heart
[1:40:43] it's it's got to be a love affair if you
[1:40:45] really want that for your life
[1:40:47] examine me o lord and prove me
[1:40:51] all right i just want to end here with
[1:40:53] an example here in luke chapter 18.
[1:40:58] luke chapter 18 starting with verse
[1:41:00] number 18 the rich young ruler
[1:41:03] i see that we are really
[1:41:05] really depending
[1:41:06] on the screen up here i don't hear any
[1:41:08] pages going
[1:41:10] but this
[1:41:11] was
[1:41:12] to me is a good example
[1:41:15] that the tree of life was being
[1:41:17] presented to this man
[1:41:21] and this man chose the tree of knowledge
[1:41:23] of good and evil
[1:41:27] because there's only two trees
[1:41:31] verse 18 and a certain ruler asked him
[1:41:34] saying good master what shall i do to
[1:41:36] inherit eternal life how can i get back
[1:41:38] to that tree of life in the garden and
[1:41:40] jesus said unto him why do you call me
[1:41:43] good there's none good say one that is
[1:41:46] god
[1:41:48] so
[1:41:49] i don't know if this this this this rich
[1:41:52] young ruler obviously didn't have a
[1:41:54] revelation of who jesus was
[1:41:56] he was just some good master
[1:41:59] he's and he said thou knowest the
[1:42:01] commandments do not commit adultery do
[1:42:03] not kill do not steal do not bear false
[1:42:05] witness under thy father and thy mother
[1:42:07] and he said all these i have kept from
[1:42:08] my youth up
[1:42:10] and when jesus heard these things he
[1:42:13] said unto him
[1:42:15] good job you're off the hook
[1:42:19] you've been you've been better than most
[1:42:21] people in your church
[1:42:24] taken us to the thing that is lacking in
[1:42:27] her life
[1:42:29] yet lack is thou one thing
[1:42:32] sell all thou has
[1:42:34] distributed unto the poor and thou shalt
[1:42:37] have treasures in heaven and then come
[1:42:39] follow
[1:42:40] me
[1:42:43] and when he heard this he was very
[1:42:44] sorrowful for he was very rich and when
[1:42:47] jesus saw that he was very sorrowful he
[1:42:49] said how hardly shall
[1:42:51] they that have riches entered to the
[1:42:52] kingdom of god for it is easier for a
[1:42:54] camel to go through the eye of a needle
[1:42:56] than for a rich man to enter into the
[1:42:58] kingdom of god
[1:42:59] and they that heard it said who then can
[1:43:02] be saved
[1:43:04] and he said these things
[1:43:06] the things which are impossible with men
[1:43:10] they're possible with god
[1:43:12] but how are they possible
[1:43:14] give god all your heart
[1:43:18] there was something in this man's life
[1:43:20] that stood before
[1:43:23] him and god
[1:43:24] not everybody he didn't say that to
[1:43:26] abraham abraham was very rich
[1:43:29] never said that
[1:43:31] god knows what's standing in our way
[1:43:33] between
[1:43:34] a culture walk or did we just say a full
[1:43:37] commitment to god amen amen
[1:43:40] then peter said lo we have left all
[1:43:44] and followed thee
[1:43:46] and
[1:43:47] look listen to this and he said unto
[1:43:49] them verily i say unto you there is no
[1:43:52] man
[1:43:53] that have left houses house or parents
[1:43:57] or brethren or wife
[1:43:59] or children
[1:44:00] for the kingdom of god's sake
[1:44:02] who shall not receive manifold more in
[1:44:06] this present time
[1:44:09] and
[1:44:10] in the world to come life everlasting
[1:44:13] god just wants to be first
[1:44:16] he's the only one in this room that
[1:44:19] knows every one of our hearts
[1:44:22] we've we've got to stand
[1:44:25] and
[1:44:26] use the greatest thing that he could
[1:44:27] give us to me is greater than the devil
[1:44:30] is the choice we have to surrender our
[1:44:32] life to god
[1:44:35] the devil don't know what to do that
[1:44:38] it's like a thousand votes let's stand
[1:44:40] together he don't know what to do
[1:44:43] when a man has surrendered his heart to
[1:44:46] god
[1:44:49] fall in love with god
[1:44:52] fall in love with him i love god yes i
[1:44:54] know
[1:44:56] let's fall more in love with him amen
[1:44:59] stretch the boundaries
[1:45:05] amen
[1:45:08] i
[1:45:09] am
[1:45:10] so
[1:45:12] needy lord
[1:45:15] so

[1:45:26] to be more like you
[1:45:32] share all my right so circumcise our
[1:45:36] heart lord in this world of sin
[1:45:43] i am
[1:45:44] so needy lord
[1:45:48] to be pure within
[1:45:54] i am so
[1:45:56] needy lord
[1:45:59] so needy of you
[1:46:04] i am so
[1:46:07] needy lord

[1:46:26] i am so needy lord
[1:46:31] to be pure within
[1:46:34] [Music]
[1:46:36] amen is that your desire
[1:46:38] it can only come through free more
[1:46:40] agency the more that you want it
[1:46:43] the more that god will do it
[1:46:46] amen you know there's a part of me that
[1:46:47] don't want it
[1:46:49] i don't want to let go of my i just i i
[1:46:53] it seems like it just becomes scared
[1:46:55] every time god gives you something and
[1:46:57] then
[1:46:58] you're asked or you get something and
[1:47:00] then you got to be willing to surrender
[1:47:02] it back to god
[1:47:04] and so it's something that we face all
[1:47:06] the time
[1:47:08] and if it's your desire
[1:47:10] let's just hold that before him as we go
[1:47:12] before him in prayer our heavenly father
