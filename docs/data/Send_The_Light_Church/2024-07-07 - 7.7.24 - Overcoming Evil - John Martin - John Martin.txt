redeemed are gathering in it won't be long but there's something good to see sister Donna this morning amen uh but there's something that we must do first before we can get in and that is we must overcome we must overcome we want to speak a little bit about that today if you turn with me in your Bibles to Revelations chap 12 uh I want to say thank you to each of you that been that prayed for us when we were gone we really appreciate that we we don't get to always go very often and get away but uh it wasn't until we got away that we realized that we needed to get away we you just keep going and going and going and uh you get that little time it takes you just a few days just to unwind and I appreciate your prayers hope this morning something could be said to help us along the way amen let's look to the Lord in a word of prayer before we read his word Lord we thank you for this precious opportunity that we could be here this morning to worship you and to praise you as we have to sing these songs of Zion to express our love to you our gratitude Lord for the blood Lord that you have called us out of the world into your kingdom we thank thank you for that today we thank you that we could be together with brothers and sisters that believe the same the same thing Lord this this word of God from cover to cover now Lord as we uh enter into the word this morning we pray that we would have that that same love that same worship that same yearning to express our with Thanksgiving for your word today bless your word to our hearts Lord let us glean from it Lord what we need that we might be better Overcomers we'll be careful to praise you for all these things now we pray them in Jesus Christ's name amen amen Revelations chapter 12 starting with verse number nine and the Great Dragon was cast out that old serpent called the devil and Satan which deceiveth the the whole world he was cast out into the Earth and his angels were cast out with him I heard a loud voice saying in heaven now is come salvation and strength and the kingdom of our God and the power of His Christ for the accuser of the Brethren is cast down which accuse them before our God day day and night and they overcame him by the blood of the Lamb by the word of their testimony and they love not their lives unto death unto the death therefore Rejoice ye heavens and ye that dwell in the earth woe to the inhabitants of the earth and of the sea for the Devil is come down unto you having great wrath because he knows he has but a short time amen God bless the reading of this word and bless you this morning as you're seated amen we want to entitle this message overcoming evil and if I could say that this message is going to be threaded with how the bride will overcome evil it's not just you know one quick thing but there's a lot to it and uh I believe we need all the word and we need to be in the center I like that this church is on Center Road it's it's in the center of the word it doesn't lead to one side or the other side it's I believe it has a good balance evil is all around us and the devil knows he has but a short time and he's coming down and he's attacking and if we understand the scriptures he's coming after the bride more than anybody it's true because they have more more truth than anyone and he's also called the accuser the brother so every time we get thoughts that are acquisation thoughts against us we understand that they're from the devil and we can get those thoughts right at church it's true but sometimes we're not spiritual enough to discern where they're coming from I mean if they're from God brother brandham says if you can't say Amen say oh me you know we we just got to take sides but sometimes we got to call out the devil call him out he's he's come to battle he knows he has but a short time he's only he's going to work very hard now he doesn't know who's who totally totally he doesn't know who seed but he knows who's trying who's in the message who's listening to the tapes and uh we just got to get our boxing gloves on and get ready to fight amen evil is on the rise in the world today faster than ever before I believe it's come out of the closet and it's right in our face now Jesus said as it was in the days of lot so shall it be in the coming of the son of man so you couldn't go spend the evening inside without your door being broken down because of perversion you can't go anywhere without seeing it you just drive up to a drive-through window and it's staring right in your face you can't turn anything on the TV without it being right there in your face just like it was in the times of Sodom Jesus said as it was in the days of Noah so shall it be in the coming of the son of man and we know at that time God saw that the wickedness of man was great in the Earth and that every imagination of the thought of his heart was only evil continually so we've got to overcome the evil that's in our thoughts in our minds evil has escaped how it's it's roaming throughout the Earth it's devouring everything in its pth it's almost like a a tornado or that a hurricane a barrel Evo has pushed the envelope open every aspect of the world there's never been a greater manifestation of evil than there is today I just read that there are currently 56 conflicts the most since World War II and they have become more International that 92 countries are involved in conflicts outside of their own borders wow Jesus has prophesied in the in the end times that there's many that are going to be offended and betray one another and and shall hate one another and if if we're living here and we're in this room we've all experienced being betrayed we've all been we've all experienced when somebody has hated us we're living in that hour it's increased I would you like to to go to a church where there's there's hatred inside and even inside know this that in the last days perilous time shall come right in the church men are lovers of their own self Covetous bols proud blasphemers unthankful Unholy right in a holy church amen without natural affection truth Breakers I'm going to do this but don't false accusers just accusing others just so they can feel better in incontinent fears despisers of those that are good always have something to say with somebody's trying to do the right thing amen traitor heady high-minded lovers of their own desires more than lovers of God that's the hour that we're living with this is evil all around us that evil is not only reigning in the world it's not only reigning in the church it wants to have preeminence in our worldly nature right and Paul said in Romans 719 for the good that I would do I do it not but the evil that I would not do that I end up doing now if I do that I would not it is no more I but sin that dwelleth in me so now he's he's making it clear that when I would I I I if I I'm doing evil it's really not my desire it's something else inside of me that's making me do it I find then a law that when I would do good evil is present with me James said from whence cometh these wars that are inside of Us come they not even of your lust that war in your members so we're not fighting against people we're not fighting against uh flesh and blood but we're fighting against Spirits inside of people and I'll say it like like this a lot of times we don't even recognize the devil coming into our own mind but that's where the battle starts he says you lost and you have not you kill and you desire to have you cannot obtain you fight in war and you have not because you ask not you ask and you receive not because you ask a miss that you may consume it upon your lust so here the the people in the church are are are literally having this confusing relationship with God that they want God for what they they're flesh once amen it's not a relationship that is just pure honest with God crazy relationship and he says you adulterers and adulteresses know you not that the Friendship of the world is an enemy with God so whosoever therefore will be a friend of the world is an enemy of God now that that's that is that's scary I don't want to in God's wrong side do you think the scripture saith in vain the spirit that dwelleth in US it lusteth to Envy evil wants to rule in our worldly nature and we've got to overcome it what a battle right inside of us right wrong good and evil it's starting to develop right inside of our minds and sometimes we don't know but what is the fruit of it it causes confusion yes where at one time we had con convictions about something now we don't that's what it does confusion James said for where envy and strife is there is confusion and every evil work amen I don't know how much you pay attention to the problems that develop in your relationships in your homes in your work but it usually just takes one thing for the devil to start something and so as he starts something you're talking about 15 different things but it was only one thing to start with the devil knows what he's doing because the more he can get in there the more he can put a wedge in there the less we can solve this problem now how do I overcome this evil well we read a three-fold purpose the blood of the Lamb the word of their testimony and they love not themselves to death it's not just one thing and you just can't say well every time I just plead the blood and that's it in order for the blood to keep working in your life you've got to walk in the light because if brother BR says God is not a obligated to show you anything more if you haven't done what he's asked you to do how can you get the benefits of the blood if you think about it if you just claim the blood anytime you could just live a life full of sin claim the blood at the end and everybody would be saved so in order to stay under the blood we've got to walk in the light we've got to pay attention to the word that's being ministered to us and the word of their testimony now that just doesn't mean your private testimony what that means is you have a word testimony your life is is you believe the word you're holding to the promises of God if the if the Bible says greater is he that's in me than he that's in the world then that's that's your testimony if if if the word says I can do all things through Christ and that's your testimony you your testimony has to be the word of God it can't be anything else and and don't you love yourself there's no room for yourself no room for your will and it can't be you know you had to do that when you gave your life to Jesus Christ yes you had to walk in the the light of I'm wrong I Repent I give my life to you you had to do that at the beginning but the Bible says unto your death in other words every day you follow the scriptures when Jesus said I uh that we deny ourselves daily Paul says I Die daily and this scripture is telling us the key to overcoming evil is to deny ourself because it gets in the way the Lord is my shepherd I shall not want amen there is evil battling right now inside of us and there's evil battling inside the whole entire world you ever wonder why there's so much evil why has God allowed evil why is evil growing and increasing and waxing worse and worse now why is it why is God allowed that well none of us want it what is the purpose of allowing evil brother brandom said straight As the gate he said the tree of Good and Evil is set before every person so we could say oh you know it's terrible what Eve did but you know what the tree is sitting right there in front of us amen that's right since the Fall In the Garden of Eden man has had Evil all around them the Bible says that we were we were born in sin and we were shapen in iniquity iniquity actually shapen us into a life of iniquity Evil's always been around us but we know evil started in heaven God allowed it to Rome throughout Heaven while he was there he allowed it to be there he allowed it in order to manifest who was the true angels and who was not the true Angels who was going to stay with God's Will and who was going to choose choose to do their own will I wonder if that's why evil is allowed to be around us today God has allowed the tree of evil the tree of death right inside the Garden of Eden he had this perfect garden but he allowed the tree of evil to be there and God has allowed evil to be everywhere from the beginning even in the church we're engaged in the greatest battle ever fought Satan is here trying to keep us from receiving the word of God Isaiah 45: 5-7 the Bible says I am the lord and there is none else there is no God beside me I GED thee though thou has not known me that they may know from the rising of the Sun from the West that there is none beside me I am the lord and there is none else that's right and he said I form the light and create Darkness I make peace yes I create evil I the Lord do all these things the Lord knows what he's doing we don't have to be afraid of evil amen perfect love will cast out all fear but if we don't respect the word of God evil can overtake us come on brother BR said in the message adoption part two he said God at the beginning before an angel was ever made how many knows he's infinite he is infinite he is God so God In His Infinite Mercy he saw that Lucifer he saw that Lucifer would would do that if he created this he'd put them onto a Freemore agency that basis and you're still there right there the tree of right and wrong set before every one of us amen and you make your choice and Lucifer was the first one to take the wrong road and he began to draw after him hogish h o g g i trying to take all for himself try to override somebody else and that's what where it started now listen to this that's where sin began in his infinite mind God has allowed evil to be set before each and every one of us for his purpose as much as we wish evil was not around he uses it for a purpose he worketh the Bible says everything after the counsel of his own will right it's here to stay we've got to accept it we' we've got to accept evil is here to stay it will stay till we're out of here yes now he wants his seed that's us to resist evil and to overcome it and that's all evil that's set before them we must face it and resist it we must face it and overcome it yes don't don't turn don't ignore it don't let it be in your home come on don't let it be in your mind don't let it be in your conversation if we yield to evil it will influence our Christian walk evil has a great power to influence Christians we are told Romans 6:16 that to whom you yield yourself servants to obey his servant you are to whom you obey whether to sin and to death or of obedience unto righteousness so the the very FL of of what you you you yield yourself to whether it's evil or good that's what's going to Prevail so if we walk with the carnal mindset the Bible says we cannot be subject to God the B the Bible says the mind the carnal mind cannot be subject to God Amen it just cannot be no matter if we're in church no matter if we're reading the Bible no matter if we're praying we got to get rid of a carnal mindset the Bible says if we walk in the flesh we'll end up biting and devouring one another yes am evil has a great power of influence on us as Christians many Christians have been derailed and started following the easy way because of this influence they've got distracted they've lost their Vision they've separated from loving God and got disconnected from the vine evil has influenced many to serve God in their own way instead of God's way and that's why we got so many different churches and denominations and beliefs because people want to serve God their own way now I don't want to serve God my way because I know my way does not bring joy it does not bring peace amen it does not bring freedom in fact my way has always led to bondage has always led to dis disappointment and sorrow uh it is by the grace of God that he shows us his way now once he shows us his way it there's where our heart comes in and says I Will Follow The Way of the Lord now we're in a great battle good and evil right or wrong it's all set before us but evil seems to be winning the battle as a whole this is kind of quiet I we should have a couple more amens with that one I'm thinking there's a great Falling Away there's an apostasy right inside the church there's mockers saying that everything seems to be the same nothing's any different where's the coming of the Lord there is a decrease in Christianity people love staying home instead of going to church God has allowed this evil to remain here until he returns it's taking everything over except one group of people right and that's his bride that is the only group that will overcome the only group that will not be deceived the only group that will not love themselves the only group that will be faithful the only group that does stay under the blood because they're the only group that's walking in the light it's the only group that has a testimony that it's the word of God and nothing but the word of God for their lives it is the only group that will prevail over all evil yes so we must overcome evil or it will overcome us now we could enjoy all the things that life can give us but if evil still is over us what good would it be in the end so we're talking this message can only make sense if we're thinking about eternal life amen now Jesus told the people in our age to him that overcometh will I grant to sit with me in my Throne you can't even be with God in his throne unless you're an overcomer right so we've got to come to face with this this message even as I also overcame and have sat down with my father in his he had to overcome see he was flesh and blood too he all he said if it's possible let this cup pass from me I don't want to die out to myself call you know what about calling 12 Legions of angels He could have done that if he wanted to he had to overcome and because he overcame the Bible says be of good cheer right I have overcame you can overcome because the over lives inside of us now he that have an ear let him hear what the spirit is saying unto the churches that's the key right there all right I want to overcome evil Romans 12: 211 tells us how to do it be not overcome of evil but overcome evil with what good well there's a there's a revelation in that right there when you're facing evil when you're dealing with with temperatures that are rising or wrath or or uh thoughts of of acquisation about others are coming into your mind when when things are going all wrong around you the only way to overcome it is with good now I'm just going to say this there's only one thing that's good that's God the only way to overcome evil is with God Amen it's only thing that can overcome evil we've all had stories where evil has showed its face and we had to make a choice of how we were going to act we' probably all experienced some sort of road rage when somebody you know cut us off or did something a little wrong to us on while we were driving we got a little bothered come on am I going to have church by myself today or we going to have it together we had to make a choice amen when someone speaks evil of you behind your back but but never seems to have enough Holy Ghost to say I'm sorry and make it right we've all had to experience that what what are we going to do with that like does it really matter if they say sorry it doesn't what really matters is that you can forgive them that's what really matters what are you going to do some people don't even know how to turn the cheek or go the Second Mile without some sort of complaining see evil is all around us 1 Peter chapter 2 chter 3:8 says finally be ye of all be ye all of One mind of course that's the mind of Christ having compassion one of another mother love as true Brethren be pitiful be courteous be polite be respectful be con consider it be friendly not rendering evil for evil well because they gave me the cold shoulder next time they want me I'm going to remember this not rendering see you're not going to overcome evil with evil that's right railing for railing but contr wise blessing knowing that you are there un to called see the Bride is a different calling that you should inherit a blessing amen you react totally different with evil you always show good you overcome the sit did you know that that's the love of God that covers a multitude of sin amen amen it isn't you explaining how wrong they were it isn't about you talking about how wrong they were it's about you learning how to cover Hallelujah I'm so glad that Jesus covered my sins you know he didn't go around into heaven and talk to all the angels and say what do you think about this come on who do we think we are to sit there and talk about somebody else not rendering evil for evil not an eye for an eye a tooth for a tooth be not overcomed of evil that's what that means I'm gonna I'm gonna I'm gonna I'm gonna hold this I'm gonna I'm gonna what are you gonna do what are you going to do you're going to be overcomed of evil with a carnal mindset of fighting and arguing and and not just being genuine in your heart but overcome evil with good turn the cheek go the second M love your enemy do good to them that hate you pray for them who despitefully use you well brother John nobody has done that in a while they will you get close to human beings and you try helping them and you will get used you know that's why some of us don't want to get close to anybody because we're afraid of being used I'll tell you what you ought to have more of the love of God in your heart come on I believe that I believe you ought to be so full of the love of God that nothing could stand in your way from helping somebody you're not your own you're bought with a price verse 10 for he that will love life and see good days let him reframe his tongue from evil notice where the evil is is the tongue and his lips that they speak no no deceit no decoys no tricks no put on just be real let him excute evil and do good let him pursue peace and ensue it seek peace and ensue it get a hold of it Peter is calling evil what comes out of our tongue and our lips but refrain from it decline from it stop evil right inside how many times have we just wanted to try to straighten things out make things right prove the other person that they're wrong and when we do we slip up and evil comes out so there's a way to do that and the the Bible says you do it with good we need a greater power than evil to overcome evil and that can only be God Amen it's not saying I have God in my life it's not saying I adure Thee by Jesus Christ who Paul preacheth we must become one with God and we must remain in that state of Oneness this is a a real uh like I said this message is really threaded with how to be an overcomer how to overcome evil because too many people think that since I gave my life to Jesus Christ everything is sold up no it's not now Jesus said in my name you shall cast out Devils but Jesus said also that many shall come to me in that day and say Lord Lord didn't we cast out Devils so it's not just having power of Christ in your life but notice these people in the last days they don't get to partake of of Heaven uh they don't get to partake of the Rapture let me just say this because they never overcame evil inside of themselves yeah it's much easier to cast out a devil out of somebody than to cast The Devil out of your own lust amen amen they didn't stay connected they didn't stay under the blood the word of God did not remain their testimony and they ended up loving themselves like Lucifer did they walked in [Music] iniquity the Bible says in 2 Timothy 3:13 but evil men and Seducer shall wax worse and worse deceiving and being deceived Satan is deceiving the whole world he's he's blinded the minds of them that do not believe notice if we just believe God will open our eyes churchgoers are getting stuck in leoda my Believers of God who once depended on God are now having an attitude why I don't need to do anything more than I'm doing they don't want to listen to you they don't need you to share any more light with them they don't want you telling them what they can do they've lost interest pressing towards the Mark or the statue of a perfect man at one time they were pressing into that and after a while the battle became so hard so they just kind of laid back and put it on cruise control I want you to know I have nothing to say negative about any single person but understand this this is how God feels about the person who isn't putting their awe into Christ he said I would rather have you serving the devil exactly what he said I'd rather have you hot or cold than to be lukewarm God that God hates lukewarmness I mean we we should never just be trying to be comfortable because that spirit is what's overtaking us to pressing in so we need to recognize the enemy trying to get us just to be you know half in and half out I don't want to be half in and half out I want to know where I'm standing with God if you're half in and you're half out I'm just telling you God would have you just just choose just choose and it didn't matter if you don't love him he's okay with that but don't don't don't come halfway that is that's such a slap in his face he he he died for you and you only want to give him half of your heart he gave you all of his heart and you only want to give him half amen Jesus called the church in our age wretched miserable poor blind and Naked Brother bam said the God of this evil age he says now look at the day that we're living in when he's calling out a bride he's got a church that claims to be doing good when it's Evil by denying the word now this is what I'm saying you know we may come to church and we may set in a message church and we may say we're are believers of the and time message but when you come to church and you hear the word and you do not take that word home and begin to practice it that is evil in the sight of God it is you're denying the word they overcame them by the word of their testimony we've got to be determined we should always leave the church with a greater determination to obey the word that we just heard if that is not there get that thing fixed get it fixed don't don't wait till the next service just get that thing right because if you don't start right you don't end right now we have a responsibility as the evil is waxing worse and worse we have the responsibility of overcoming evil with good and that means we need to make better choices better decisions amen we need to we need to choose to put God first we need to choose to do good when evil is right there in our face and we don't like it and you know you don't even have to go to you don't even have to be taught by Mom and Dad or anybody in the world how to render evil for evil when we're in the world somebody crossed you at school you just want to beat that boy up and the girls want to beat the girls up right and and the brothers wanted to beat this other brothers up in their home you don't got to be taught that but as we we're learning that Christ is not like that and we can't wait for just a good circumstance so mom's doing good the children are doing good everything's work's doing good the money's coming everything's good so you know what I'm just going to practice Christianity now we don't practice Christianity when everything's good we've got to overcome evil and we've got that responsibility whether we like it or not we've got to choose the right things you know sometimes we got to make church family a priority that's right our God family a priority our brothers and sisters a priority you know I think you know sometimes we become a little selfish and the only thing we think about is us I think we need to practice laying down our life for one another that doesn't mean do something out of your abundance don't give out of the abundance but hurt yourself to help somebody come on start with sacrificing some time in prayer praying for somebody a little bit longer than you would want to if you believe that God lives in you then let's start activating that power John said 1 John 4:4 ye are of God little children and have overcome them what is them evil spirits you've overcome the evil spirits because greater is he that is in you than he that is in the world no doubt every one of us believe God's inside of us and everyone also believes that the devil can get inside of us because we step back and we say why did I do that I'm sorry Lord now here's the thing there's this battle and we've got to be an overcum we cannot take the attitude of well we're all Sinners we all make mistakes you know none of us are perfect what are you doing you're building yourself a little web to lay in how about God not only sees me as Overcomer but I have such a desire to show him I'm an overcomer how about that love in our heart to want to manifest Christ you know a lot of times when somebody's mad or upset at us did something wrong you know we're so mad at them we don't even care about helping them come on it's true we want to prove the wrong and that's about all we want to do but there ought to be such a love in our heart that we want to help somebody in order to really help them you got to get yourself out of the way and you've got to love them right amen now Christ is our source of strength to overcome all things and if Christ is our source of strength then we must remain connected to that source of strength of all at all times have you ever been in the presence of God just had a wonderful time in his presence and I'll tell you maybe 15 minutes half hour hour later you end up doing something that you know was not God right and you wonder what happened you didn't stay connected and so I want to talk about a subject just for a little bit that I think is so often confusing because we've accepted God in life because we've got salvation because we're in the message there's that tendency to think that we are never disconnected from God and this is what I'm saying this can be this this is a subject that can be very mixed up but I'm telling you the prophet taught us that at any time that we grieve the Holy Spirit which we shouldn't be doing but we can that we that that that the Holy Spirit Has Its Right to leave us until we get that thing right so at that time when that's happening and I think it happens a lot more than what we realize that there is a disconnection that's taken in place now we are still Gods we are still the seat of God we still belong to God but we we're not doing what we should be doing at that time turn with me if you would to John chapter 15 John chapter 15 I want to read the first seven verses there Jesus speaking in John 15 I am the True Vine and ye and my father is the husband men every man every branch in me that beareth not fruit he take taketh it away now notice the branch is already in him there it's there's already a connection they're already part but he's making this strong statement that every branch in me that beareth not fruit he's going to take it away and every branch that is bearing fruit he's going to end up pruning some of it that for a purpose that he would see more fruit we we might look at God and say he's not very satisfied but he is one that wants to bring out the most of us the best of us he wants to see more than what he's seeing I I love that knowing that's the nature of God now ye are clean through the word which I've spoken unto you right if you allow the word to correct you you become clean and I love that abide in me and I in you as the father cannot bear fruit as the branch cannot bear fruit of itself except it abide in the vine and no more can you except you abide in me so how in the world are we going to overcome evil when we're not connected when we're going through the course of the day we did our little prayer we we read our our little scripture for the day and we just shoot on the day and we expect that we're just going to overcome evil when it slaps in our in our face that we're just going to not we're going to react right A relationship is more than just a little prayer in the morning a little reading of the word it's it's a relationship every relationship that you have you want you want respect out of that relationship but you also want that person that you have a relationship with I don't care if it's the mailman I don't care who it is you want them to be true and loyal to you is that the truth can you say Amen to that amen you want that everybody does God wants that and to whom much is given much is required amen so here we are we're with a god whose mind is to prune us a little bit more to get a little bit more fruit out of us and tells us that we got to stay connected to him or else it's not the relationship's not going to work can you say amen amen all right let's continue reading now he said I am the vine you are the branches he that abideth in me and I in him the same bringeth forth much fruit for without me you can't bear fruit right you can't be longsuffering you can't turn the cheek you can't love when somebody's hating you you just can't do it if a man abide not in me he is cast forth as a branch and is withered and Men God gather them and cast them into the fire and they are burned if you abide in me and my words abide in you ye shall ask what you will and it shall be done unto you now that's a promise the thing is I think there's too many trying to claim the promise without abiding in Christ trying to claim something without doing what God has asked of the relationship abiding with him now here in is my father glorified that ye bear much fruit so shall ye be my disciples I I believe that if we abide in Christ that is how we're going to overcome evil we've got to stay connected in if I could say it like this not connected to your salvation not connected to um uh being saved going to heaven but staying connected into a relationship now we all have relationships right every one of us have some sort of relationship our the the the young people here they have relationship with their teachers and if if you just if if you follow the instructions you will find favor with the with the teacher amen but you don't do your homework you act wrong in class you're causing trouble you want to be the goofy guy of the day I am telling you you're going to find that you're not finding faith favor in that relationship so you've got to stay connected to Christ I will say of the Lord he is my strength he is my shield he is my my buckler my defense my refuge my safety my strong tower he is my shelter I am connected to him he's my comor my counselor my City of Refuge he is My All In All right because that's relationship I have with them the only way to overcome evil is to stay connected to Christ stay connected in the vine it's not just an imaginary relationship that we have with God it should be one that we present our bodies a Living Sacrifice unto God the Bible says which is our a reasonable service to not be conformed to the evil that's in the world but to be transformed by the renewing of our minds that we could present ourselves and prove what is that good and perfect and acceptable will of God see now we know we know people that are not in the message that are not in the truth that say they have a relationship with God and a and they do all kinds of bad things and they think it's okay but you know what we've been given the word we should be able to take our life in this word and prove what is the the perfect will of God what is the only will that's acceptable to him what is the only will that he considers to be a good will it's God so we're challenged if we're risen with Christ to pres to to seek those things which are above to set our affections on things above to stay connected to the vine you know sometimes we have to pray longer than we want to pray we may have to stay at the altar a little bit longer than the last song that we sung We may have to cry out for the Holy Ghost to show up a little bit longer than we want to am if we want to stay connected to the vine we've got to take time to set our affections on things above don't try to fit it in on two Services he is a rewarder to them that diligently seek him God doesn't take Delight in part- timr those who show up for church when it's convenient and they don't even take the word home they leave him there when they leave church David said blessed is the man that walketh not in the counsil of the ungodly nor standeth in in the way of Sinners nor sth in the seat of the scornful but his Delight is in the law of the Lord and in his word doth he meditate day and night can you say Amen to that and he shall be like a tree planted by the rivers of water that bringeth forth his fruit in his season and his Leaf shall not wither and whatsoever he does you notice it prospers yes amen that's where I want to be amen where I'm not there I want to be there am where I'm not prospering where I don't have what the Holy Ghost says I I need to have that's where I want to be we got to stay connected to Christ Our relationship has to stay fresh that's what I'm meaning by staying connected keep your relationship fresh keep it up to date no matter what you're dealing with keep your relationship up to date in other words whatever God has spoken to you in the past may it be important to you so important that you take care of it amen God isn't obligated to show us more things if we're not walking in the light we've got to stay current you know everybody's got a computer and they have these constant updates that you got to update your computer right you've got new viruses and you got to keep things current well I'm going to tell you the devil's concocting new ways and new new he he gets us he he can really get us off track and us not even know about because we've been blundering in leoa and we've got to we got to understand we've got to stay connected and get updated by god of what he wants us to do because it's through obedience that we overcome evil we must stay under the blood stay confessing your sins keep walking in the light keep testifying what the word says about you don't say I can't do that anymore the word says I can do all things through Christ who strengthen me make that your testimony the word must remain your testimony we must continue to Die daily to our desires that's what the scripture says they over came the evil devil by not loving themselves unto the death they didn't just say at the beginning when you gave your heart to Christ but we got to continue to recognize that our greatest enemy is ourself it's really not who we disagree with the most who we got the most problems with it's ourself that's standing in the way of overcoming evil don't let Leo dece get a strangle hold in your life stay connected to God stay in prayer stay connected to the word stay connected to the message stay connected to the church stay connected to the body as we heard Wednesday don't let the cares of this life overtake you right stay in love with God Amen stay indebted to him stay humble before him stay focused in your callings stay in the word stay abounding in the work of the Lord stay in prayer stay seeking him choose to stay connected and you will overcome evil seek ye first the kingdom of God we all remember when we were young that we were not able to have certain privileges until our responsibilities were done right maybe our homework maybe our chores all of us you know we couldn't eat our dessert until we ate our food right and if we want all things to be met in our life then we need to seek the kingdom of God first amen stay connected keep seeking God first in your life each day we make choices to stay connected or we make the choice that we're going to handle life with our best ability our attitude has everything to do with overcoming the circumstances in our personal life Jesus wants us he's allowed evil to stay here Jesus wants us to live in this world with evil all around us and he wants us to choose to overcome the evil think about that and he gives us a lot of opportunities doesn't he yes he does amen and we overcome it by the power of God John Jesus said in John 17 14 I have given them Thy word and the world have hated them because they are not of the world even as I am not of the world I pray not that thou should us take them out of the world where all that evil is right but that thou should us keep them from the evil amen God's desire is to keep us from the evil God has a plan for his elect bride to keep us from the evil as if increasing I believe we need to be increasing with Christ 1 Peter chapter 1 verse 5 the Bible says who are kept by the power of God through faith unto salvation ready to be revealed in the last time wherein you greatly Rejoice though now for a season if need be ye are in heaviness through manifold Temptations amen that the trial of your faith being much more precious than gold that perishes though it be tried with fire might be found un the praise and honor and Glory at the appearing of Jesus Christ we are kept by the power of God through faith amen you know the Bible says God dwells in our heart by faith if you don't believe it he's not there the moment you think well where did God go each day we must remember we got to do our part we got to make the right decisions in order to stay connected we got to choose not just the first day I choose to serve the Lord remember when you made that decision I'm going to choose to serve the Lord I remember making that decision I remember calling my girlfriend when she was up at Central and I told her I've made a decision I'm going to start serving God and I'll never forget that decision now we all had a lot of ups and downs since that choice that we made and I believe if we are not careful to make that decision every single day choose to serve the Lord every day that we're going to get tripped up by evil we can't go on yesterday's experience to hold us today we can't we can't now we can build off of that that we can keep that but we can't ignore that we need more of God because evil is increasing that means we need more of the Holy Ghost so every day we must choose the fight the good fight of Faith to lay hold of the promises of God to take the whole armor of God to to lay aside the the the weights the sins that so easily beset us you get time to read Ephesians chapter 6 13-18 it tells you about the whole armor of God Amen each day we must choose to maintain a god centered attitude right Paul said let this mind be in you that was in Christ Jesus brother Ram said the right mental attitude towards any Divine promise of God will bring it to pass that's how important the right attitude is start with the right mindset the right attitude choose to be an over Comer I want us to begin to seek more of the Holy Ghost I'm I am so honestly I am so I don't like using the word proud but I am so proud of all the holy ghost that I see in your lives I am because the only way that has happened is because you chose more of God now there is more for us to have and I believe that we're going to need to be so full of the Holy Ghost in order to overcome all evil in this age yes Jesus said you shall receive power after the Holy Ghost has come upon you so you have the promise when you seek more Holy Ghost you're automatically going to get more power and when you got more power you know it's easy to overcome right it if you did not have any money to buy dinner you have no power if you didn't have any gas in your car you couldn't drive it if you have no Holy Ghost if you're if you're not keeping that fresh if you if you're not yield in yourself if if you're not staying connected then you don't have the power to overcome first Peter or second Peter 1:3 says that it is God's divine power that gives us all things that pertaineth unto life and godliness it's the holy ghost that what is what we need whereby are given unto us exceeding great and precious promises that by these we might be partakers of the divine nature yes having escaped the corruption that is in the world through lust now if you were going to invite me over your house to have dinner I just want to stop there and think about that for a minute but if you were to invite me over for dinner and you made your delicious dinner I would and I I I took a scoop out of the bowl and I put it on my plate and I began to taste it I would be partaking of your dinner now it is the promises of God that we have right here that we believe in Christ dwells in our heart by faith that if we can believe that Christ is in us the more of the nature of Christ that we can get in the more that we can escape escape the lust that's in this world that's what the Bible says having escaped the corruption that is in the world through lust how do we excape it by getting more of God's nature that's how we escape it we don't learn to be better Christians it's not through some education that we become a better Christian it's through the power of God living inside of us that's how we become better Christians as we partake of God's nature we will escape the evil nature now God is looking for character just please bear with me just a little bit longer God is looking for character thank you brother M thank you brother Ron some out there is knowing what I'm looking for and amen he's going to marry character now character is having power to do your own will but choosing to do God's just in Simplicity what character is brother brandham said power without character is satanic in other words you have free more agency you can do what you want uh but you you can do what God wants but you choose to do what you want to do so anybody who exercises their own will is really exercising a satanic power and don't even realize it amen amen now brother brandom said character is not going to be gifted to us it's not a gift but rather it's a victory in order to have a victory you have to overcome something you have to overcome you have to overcome we actually have to fight for something if we're going to get character so allow evil to be around you don't be bothered by it don't say well I hope he she don't act like this and he don't act like this and my boss isn't like this and my kids aren't like this don't worry about anything don't fear anything because God in you is greater than anything that you'll face that's what character is I can overcome this situation I can make a difference character is the power to choose God's will over your own in the middle of a Temptation 1 John chapter 5:4 says but whatsoever is born of God overcometh the world and this is the victory that overcometh the world even our faith don't expect God to just flood you with victories evil is set there so you can take your the faith that you have in the word of God and face it and overcome it with good and I'll say it like this if you truly believe that you're born again the Bible cannot lie you will overcome there is one group that will overcome all things and that's those who've been completely born again completely therefore If any man be in Christ he's a new creature old things are passed away behold All Things become new and all things are of God I know for us that got busy schedules this is a hard thing to to comprehend that God really wants to be that much in our life but he does the new birth is a continuation of the manifestation of Christ in our life I just if you can remember this the rest of your life the new birth is a continuation of the manifestation of Christ in life you can't just say oh I was born again then if you were born again then you're still born again and and and to me if God gives you another year God expects you to manifest more of him so it is a continuation of Christ in our lives we can't get away we will be Overcomers because the word of God cannot lie every seed brings forth of its kind the Bible says not the Bible but brother Bram said in the message God of this evil age is I'm close in now the humble little bride of Christ just simply believes the word whoever she is it's individuals I hope and trust that there's many sitting present many listening in and I hope that myself and every one of you all are a part of that bride I hope many and it will all that's been ordained to that will be that because it's their nature their nature I think it's it's important for us to focus on the nature not so much what we think feel believe up here but how we act how we handle how we overcome evil with good that nature amen praise the Lord let's Stand Together keep your testimony stay connected choose him every day doesn't mean you're not going to mess up you will mess up but what it means is you'll get up quick you'll say I'm sorry I don't care if you do it five times 10 times if Jesus expects us to forgive 7times 70 I believe he forgives us 7times 70 stay connected stay in love the Bible says keep yourselves in the love of God stay connected to him let's sing that little chorus learning to lead Learning to Lean Learning to Lean I'm learning to lean Learning to Lean on [Music] Jesus gaining more

is just more of you of things I've had my feel and yet I hunger still empty and be Lord here our prayer more of [Music] you amen maybe we could just sing that little chorus pleasing quietly as we bow our heads for a word of Prayer amen let's just B on a word of prayer our heavenly father we come to you as a body of Believers as one family here we're not leaving one out we're not segregating one we're not separating any Lord the most spiritual to the most carnal Lord to those that have been close to you to those that have drifted Lord each and every one we're bringing before your throne at this moment because Lord we need you we need more of you Lord I pray heavenly father that you would fill us more with yourself you're all that we need Lord we don't need anything else but you just more of your spirit living inside of us I pray for every heart for every believer for every desire that they hold inside their heart at this moment Lord that you would Grant it to them Lord I know what your desire to see us all Overcomers to be there in that day to be sitting on the throne with you right next to you Lord and I know that's possible only because you have you have made a way for us to get there Lord You've showed us the way you've told us and that's to have that Holy Spirit the over great Overcomer living inside of us Lord I pray that you would Lord come cover us with your blood keep us covered Lord we want to stay under the the token of that blood Lord help us to walk in the light help us not to leave part of the word here but help us to take it home Lord help us not to succumb to to thoughts in our mind that we just feel Lord that we're so uh distant from you and and and and and not worth trying but Lord give us the testimony that your word tells us to testify that you you live in our hearts by faith and Lord that you are there and you're greater than any evil the thoughts or things that we're facing and father I pray that You' give us the grace to stay humble instead of to love ourselves to love you more to fall deeper in love with you to get to know you in an intimate relationship Lord to know you and have you in ways that Lord we haven't experienced it because you are a God that can do exceedingly greater than all the things that we could pray for and even think Lord help us that we can tap into those things and bless us as a body Lord that we may grow and share this great gift that you have given us the gift of yourself inside of us manifest yourself Lord as we yield ourself and give you ourselves for we ask all these things and give you the praise for them in the precious name of Jes
