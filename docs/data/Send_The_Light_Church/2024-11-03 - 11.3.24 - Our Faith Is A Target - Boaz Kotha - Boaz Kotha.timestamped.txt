[21:55] from the Philippines to remember all the
[21:58] Saints there that have lost their houses

[22:08] it remember those Believers in
[22:12] Spain they didn't get much of a warning
[22:15] and it just kind of washed everything
[22:18] away it's a great thing to have God on

[22:24] side it's a great thing to put your
[22:26] trust in somebody bigger than you you so
[22:29] when the Trials come and the tri the
[22:31] weather and everything is going against
[22:33] you you can say he's my pilot he's the

[25:39] while he's walking up here brother Ron
[25:42] says uh he's looking for someone to help
[25:45] clean the church while he's having
[25:47] surgery um and if you can see him that
[25:51] would be great
[25:53] amen thank you um just this is just a
[25:56] quick reminder you know as the weather
[25:59] gets colder you know what happens
[26:01] everybody stays inside and you know what
[26:03] happens with that germs spread around
[26:05] more quickly and we do have a a
[26:08] significant number of people here who
[26:11] who are uh really sub you know their
[26:13] their health is such that uh they can
[26:16] get sick very easily and uh it could uh
[26:19] the consequences are are greater than
[26:22] let's say a normal healthy person but we
[26:24] have a number of them and also us olders
[26:26] as we get older and you young people
[26:29] it's going to happen to you eventually
[26:31] um you know you start your immune
[26:33] systems are broken down a little more so
[26:35] all I'm really asking is if you're sick
[26:37] please stay home and uh that would be a
[26:40] benefit to all of us and if your
[26:41] children are sick please keep them home
[26:44] it can be a hassle I know because you
[26:46] know it could spread around but it's
[26:48] just much better if we just keep them
[26:50] home and we just minimize the
[26:52] possibility of uh of catching cold flu
[26:56] covid you know the whole thing so we do
[26:58] have the online service and uh that's
[27:01] what that's for so I would appreciate if
[27:03] everybody would do
[27:08] that praise the

[41:42] author of our life our Lord Jesus Christ
[41:45] Luke 2231 and 32 and I'll be also
[41:50] reading from Luke
[41:52] 188 Luke 22
[41:54] 3132 and the Lord said Simon Simon
[41:59] behold Satan had desired to have you
[42:02] that he may sift you as wheat but I have
[42:06] prayed for thee that thy faith fail not
[42:10] and when thou art converted strengthen
[42:14] thy Brethren amen Luke

[42:23] speedily nevertheless when the son of
[42:26] man cometh shall you find faith on the
[42:30] earth may the Lord bless the reading of
[42:32] his holy word you may be seated thank
[42:35] you so
[42:36] much I would like to talk on a a subject
[42:41] or a title called our faith is a target
[42:45] you know
[42:47] amen we have been targeted or our faith
[42:51] is targeted from both
[42:53] ends one is from God and one is from the
[42:57] enemy amen the enemy is targeting our
[43:02] faith as well as God is targeting our
[43:06] faith he's checking how much faith we
[43:09] have today you knowen when 2,000 years
[43:13] ago when he was upon this Earth and as
[43:16] he was ascending into heaven or going
[43:18] back to Heaven you know he said I will
[43:21] not leave you comfortless but I will
[43:23] send you a comforter you right amen and
[43:26] that's a a uh word which can strengthen
[43:29] us so much you know that we have a
[43:31] comforter today and that is nothing but
[43:34] the Holy Ghost amen without Holy Ghost
[43:37] we can't go far enough in our life you
[43:40] know sometimes we as human beings we try
[43:44] to uh walk with without God in this
[43:48] world you know there are times in our
[43:50] life knowingly unknowingly we try to
[43:53] walk leaning upon our own understanding
[43:56] right very but I want to tell you that
[43:59] we can't go far you know that's right
[44:01] and I believe in the eyes of God in the
[44:04] plan of God there is always a uturn you
[44:07] know you know you can't go so far but
[44:11] you know at one point you have to make a
[44:14] uturn and come back to where you left
[44:18] God Amen whether it is a month ago or a
[44:21] 6 months ago a year ago or maybe 10
[44:24] years ago but at one point of Al we have
[44:28] to make a urn amen whether it is young
[44:31] people or middle-aged or old we all have
[44:35] to come to a realization that we need to
[44:37] come back to the Pavilion amen the
[44:40] prophet of God said that this is the
[44:42] time that we need to make ourself you
[44:46] know coming towards the Pavilion where
[44:49] we left God we have to come back to
[44:51] Pentecost you know we have to come back
[44:54] to the oldtime religion we have have to
[44:57] come back where we have left God Amen
[45:00] because without God we cannot do
[45:01] anything
[45:03] amen this is a a very terrible time the
[45:07] age we are living in you know the other
[45:10] day I was uh preaching on you know in
[45:13] India you know on the shaken Nest you
[45:16] know and a mighty Wing you know amen
[45:19] thank God we are shaken you know
[45:21] sometimes he tries us he he tests us you
[45:24] know and there is a time that he will
[45:27] allow the enemy to test us you know but
[45:30] in everything in every walk of of our
[45:33] life God is present with us amen as I
[45:37] always say you know I would rather walk
[45:40] in Low Valley or dark hour of my life or
[45:44] the dark valleys in my life with Jesus
[45:47] Christ than to walk in light alone you
[45:50] know I don't want to be alone and so are
[45:53] you you know it's our desire that we
[45:56] want to have the Lord in our every step
[45:59] in our every Walk of
[46:01] Life we go through battles in our life
[46:04] we have so many trials ups and downs in
[46:07] our life you
[46:08] know but thank God for the Holy Ghost
[46:11] today that he has given to us you know
[46:14] that it will correct us it will take us
[46:17] into the right path it will direct us
[46:19] you know
[46:21] amen and I truly believe you know
[46:24] whenever we are in need of anything the
[46:27] only place where we can rest upon is in
[46:30] the presence of
[46:32] God the house of God is the house of
[46:35] correction amen if you are not corrected
[46:38] here there is no other place in the
[46:41] world where you will be corrected you
[46:43] know thank God for the word of God today
[46:46] you know that has become a light unto
[46:48] our feet you know it has become lamp to
[46:51] our lives you know to lead us and to
[46:54] guide us you know during this taking
[46:57] time during this trying times of our
[46:59] life I think we need to come to a place
[47:04] of resting and that's the word of God
[47:07] Amen if you see the life of uh Simon
[47:11] Peter here you know a man who was used
[47:15] by God a man who walked on the water a
[47:19] man who did Miracles a man who followed
[47:23] Christ in every walk of his life who ate
[47:26] with him who sat with him who lived with
[47:29] him who saw Miracles who did Miracles
[47:32] but at one
[47:34] time before Christ was going to be
[47:37] crucified you know the Lord was dealing
[47:39] with Simon he said Simon do you love
[47:43] me and Simon said yes I love you he said
[47:47] feed my sheep right and then again he
[47:49] said Simon do you love me he said yes
[47:52] Lord I love you he said feed my sheep
[47:54] you know yes and the third time time
[47:57] again he asked Simon Simon do you love
[47:59] me he says feed my sheep you know yes
[48:03] and again he asked Simon really do you
[48:06] love
[48:08] me we come to a point sometimes you
[48:12] know I feel as I speak now is is as if
[48:16] God is trying to question me do I really
[48:20] love
[48:21] him do I really serve him do I really
[48:24] walk with him you know
[48:27] coming to church is not serving the lord
[48:30] no everybody comes to the church the
[48:33] good the bad the evil you know the
[48:35] prophet said three kinds of Believers
[48:37] you know make believer unbeliever and
[48:40] believer and God is not worried about a
[48:42] Believer and neither is worried about
[48:44] the unbeliever true right but he is more
[48:47] worried about a make believer right
[48:49] because you don't
[48:51] know when he will change his colors you
[48:54] know
[48:55] right but thank God that God has put us
[48:58] in a place today that we are called to
[49:01] be his bride we are called to be his
[49:05] children you know amen and we need to
[49:09] understand today we need to realize who
[49:12] we are today where we came from yes
[49:16] there is a great blessing when we really
[49:19] serve the Lord and love the Lord amen in
[49:23] spite of persecution in spite of ups and
[49:26] downs in in my country I still always
[49:29] strive and ask God Lord keep me in your
[49:32] perfect will I want to serve you till
[49:35] the last breath of my life till the last
[49:38] drop of my blood you
[49:40] know I want to thank God for his grace
[49:43] and
[49:44] mercy today I I think we need to come to
[49:47] a a point of realization do I really
[49:50] serve God do I really love him you know
[49:54] because if we don't come to that
[49:57] realization you can come to the church
[49:59] for the next 10 years and it's not going
[50:02] to help you all you'll be doing is
[50:05] warming up the pews and just go after 1
[50:09] hour or two hour you know but I want to
[50:12] tell you today that we need to have a a
[50:16] close a personal relationship with
[50:21] God when Peter said when Peter was asked
[50:24] do you really love me Peter
[50:29] humanly speaking he said yes I love you
[50:31] you
[50:32] know just by his mouth you know he said
[50:35] I love you Lord you know I serve you I
[50:38] I'm I'm with you wherever you are I with
[50:41] you but when he when he you know pressed
[50:44] into it he said do you really love
[50:49] me he said you know it everything Lord
[50:54] amen and I truly believe that today God
[50:57] knows every heart yes from the beginning
[51:01] Till the End Amen roow God knows
[51:05] everyone amen what we are who we are
[51:09] what kind of life we are living yes I
[51:12] always say you know it is not important
[51:15] to be holy in the four walls of the
[51:17] church no everybody can be holy in the
[51:20] four walls of the church amen but it is
[51:24] when we are all by ourself whether it is
[51:26] our schools our College our homes our
[51:29] bedrooms or our workplace our business
[51:32] whatever it
[51:34] is today it is important that how we are
[51:39] living with God Walking with
[51:43] God many people say Hey brother are you
[51:46] in the message you
[51:48] know many people question me you know
[51:51] when I go to a new place the first thing
[51:53] they will ask me are you in the message
[51:55] you know
[51:58] if they repeat it twice or Thrice then I
[52:01] tell them it is not important to be in
[52:04] the message but the message should be in
[52:06] US amen the prophet said live the
[52:10] message not talk the message live the
[52:13] message amen and if we have the power of
[52:17] the holy spirit in our life if we have
[52:20] that Authority if you have that personal
[52:23] experience of Walking with God I want to
[52:26] tell you brothers and sisters you don't
[52:28] need to be taught
[52:32] amen
[52:33] today sometime the man of God or The
[52:36] Shepherd of the house of God needs to
[52:38] teach the ABCs all the
[52:41] time but I want to tell you if you can
[52:43] have a personal experience with
[52:47] God God is not looking for a group
[52:51] relationship he's not looking for a
[52:53] church
[52:54] relationship he's looking for an
[52:56] individual relationship
[52:59] today the self-existing god The God Who
[53:03] exist The God Who is omnipresent Omni
[53:06] poent omnicient the Lord who is a
[53:09] Shepherd you
[53:12] know I like that statement the Lord is
[53:14] my shepherd I shall not
[53:17] warn there was a Sunday school teacher
[53:20] who said to a 4-year-old girl he said go
[53:23] and learn Psalms 23 and next Sunday I'm
[53:26] going to ask
[53:28] you and everybody was sitting in the
[53:30] Sunday school you
[53:32] know and that little girl was asked she
[53:35] says why don't you repeat or tell what
[53:38] Psalm 23 is she stood up and she says
[53:41] the Lord is my shepherd and that's all I
[53:44] want and she sat
[53:46] down that's
[53:48] true the Lord is Our Shepherd and that's
[53:51] all we want you amen praise the Lord all
[53:55] the next five verses are in that one
[53:59] line the Lord is my shepherd that's all
[54:02] I want amen and if there is anything
[54:05] today that we
[54:06] need more and more of God that he must
[54:10] be the shepherd of our life yes we must
[54:14] love him we must serve him
[54:18] amen sometimes I I I realize I I
[54:22] wonder how come Peter who has been
[54:25] walking so
[54:28] close with God a man who walked on the
[54:32] water there's nobody in the whole world
[54:36] in the history of the world a man who
[54:39] walked on the water that was only Peter
[54:41] you know but look at his condition
[54:46] today the Bible says Simon Simon behold
[54:50] Satan I desired to have you right
[54:56] if he can have Peter that means he can
[54:58] even have
[55:00] you he can even have me he can have any
[55:04] one of you
[55:07] right he says the Satan had desired to
[55:10] have you that he may sift you as a wheat
[55:14] yes I have not seen it in in America
[55:17] people sifting the wheat but you know in
[55:19] my country back home you know yes even
[55:22] today you during the Harvest time they
[55:25] stand on the heap of rise or grain or
[55:28] corn or anything or wheat or anything it
[55:31] is and they try to take that you know
[55:33] pan and you know try to Swift the wheat
[55:35] you know why do they do
[55:38] that to keep the Shu away from the grain
[55:42] from the
[55:44] seed and
[55:47] sometimes as the word of God says the
[55:49] devil will try to sift you as a
[55:53] wheat the devil will try to test you and
[55:57] God allows it you
[56:00] know we have an example of job you
[56:05] know God said where were you you know I
[56:08] have been going from to and fro over the
[56:10] Earth you know you
[56:14] know and God said did you did you had a
[56:19] chance to meet my servant
[56:22] job look at the confidence God had in
[56:26] job amen amen my brothers my sister you
[56:29] know it should be we should come to such
[56:32] a point that God must have confidence in
[56:36] us and we should have confidence in God
[56:40] whether we go through ups and downs or
[56:42] trials in our
[56:45] life it doesn't
[56:51] matter if we can have confidence in
[56:53] God's faithfulness yes
[56:56] God also must have confidence in
[57:01] us he
[57:03] says Satan has desired to have you that
[57:06] he may sift you as wheat but look at the
[57:09] goodness of God he says but I have
[57:12] prayed for thee amen that thy faith fail
[57:16] not and when thou art
[57:19] converted strengthen thy
[57:23] Brethren this is the time in Simon's
[57:25] life
[57:27] he's saying I'm going to be
[57:30] crucified I'm going to be gone but
[57:33] before that you will tell lies three
[57:36] times before the
[57:39] crows you will deny me
[57:43] Peter that's why he asked that question
[57:46] do you love me do you love me do you
[57:49] love me do you love
[57:52] me at one point Peter said you know
[57:55] everything
[57:58] everything the Lord himself knew that
[58:01] before the crows he will deny him
[58:04] three times amen he will reject
[58:10] him but the goodness of God is he says
[58:14] Peter I have prayed for
[58:18] thee what if the Lord comes to you your
[58:21] your bedside today when you are going
[58:23] through tough trials in your life and if
[58:26] he comes and
[58:27] says John I pray for you I have prayed
[58:31] for thee am oh brother Roger I have
[58:35] prayed for
[58:37] you if I can tell my brother if my
[58:40] brother tells me brother boas I'm
[58:42] praying for you how much comfort we get
[58:46] amen but it's God himself the creator of
[58:50] the world the savior of the world the
[58:53] ruler of the world he says Peter I have
[58:56] prayed for thee amen why he prayed for
[59:00] Peter so that his faith will not fail
[59:05] right that
[59:08] means today our faith is at Target amen
[59:13] thank you the devil is after
[59:17] us the devil is after every one of us
[59:21] and so is the Lord he's trying you he's
[59:24] testing your faith today amen thank God
[59:28] for the word of God he said I tell you
[59:31] that he will avenge them speedily
[59:33] nevertheless when the son of man cometh
[59:35] shall he find faith on
[59:39] earth when he comes back he's not going
[59:42] to ask you how many million dollars you
[59:45] have earned your business right
[59:49] true he's not going to ask you or see or
[59:52] look at your Cadillac or your you know
[59:55] nice house and a nice Bungalow
[59:59] no he's not coming to look at our
[1:00:04] status but he says when I come will I
[1:00:07] find Faith
[1:00:10] Hallelujah Hebrews 11 talks about
[1:00:13] without faith it is impossible to please
[1:00:16] God brothers sisters our faith is a
[1:00:20] center of the target which God does
[1:00:22] shoot when he tries us
[1:00:26] and if any other Grace if any other
[1:00:29] grace shall Escape
[1:00:32] untried certainly faith shall
[1:00:36] not the grace in our lives can escape
[1:00:41] from the test or from The Trial but the
[1:00:43] faith cannot
[1:00:46] be Faith must be
[1:00:48] tried right then only know God will know
[1:00:52] who we are and what we are
[1:00:57] he loves to sometime put you to trials
[1:01:00] and
[1:01:02] troubles so that he can
[1:01:05] know how we
[1:01:07] function when we are tried and
[1:01:11] tested we are human beings it's a human
[1:01:14] nature when When Trials comes in our
[1:01:17] life we are frustrated we go
[1:01:20] Haywire we don't know where we are we
[1:01:22] don't know what we are doing but my
[1:01:24] brothers my sister that that's the only
[1:01:27] time we need to be
[1:01:29] silent we need to rest upon God's word
[1:01:32] we need to rest upon God Amen instead of
[1:01:36] running from pillars to Poe it is good

[1:04:03] desire in our heart that no matter what
[1:04:06] may come or
[1:04:09] go if you can love God and serve
[1:04:13] God praise the Lord if you look in this
[1:04:17] chapter Peter has been
[1:04:20] Justified he's a man who believed on the
[1:04:22] Lord Jesus
[1:04:24] Christ he would even preach the gospel
[1:04:27] but Jesus told him after you are
[1:04:32] converted then strengthen your brothers
[1:04:35] amen
[1:04:36] see after you
[1:04:39] converted what is
[1:04:43] conversion conversion is the holy spirit
[1:04:46] that moves the old nature out and the
[1:04:50] new nature comes in which is the Holy
[1:04:53] Ghost AM and when a man has truly been
[1:04:56] Bond of the spirit of God he has
[1:05:00] everlasting
[1:05:01] life that's why Jesus said so he that
[1:05:04] heareth my words and believeth on him
[1:05:06] that sent me ha everlasting life right
[1:05:10] and shall not come into condemnation or
[1:05:12] judgment but has passed from Death unto
[1:05:15] life
[1:05:17] amen brothers
[1:05:20] sisters sometimes our own walk seems to
[1:05:23] be so perfect in our own eyes that's
[1:05:27] right the prophet of God said he
[1:05:32] said I may not be perfect in your eyes
[1:05:36] you may not be perfect in my eyes but
[1:05:38] what about God's eyes
[1:05:41] amen today we judge everyone easily yes
[1:05:46] yes sometimes we judge the book bites
[1:05:51] cover but God doesn't do that no
[1:05:56] what he is looking at is the inward man
[1:06:00] the inner man today he doesn't look at
[1:06:02] the outer of a person right we do
[1:06:06] it but God looks into the inner self of
[1:06:10] a person amen we need conversion today
[1:06:13] we need total transformation Israel and
[1:06:16] the church he says conversion not by any
[1:06:19] fleshly demonstration or emotion right

[1:06:25] that's change your whole opinion change
[1:06:28] your whole nature

[1:06:35] Christ has come into you and converted

[1:07:56] my
[1:07:58] church and that is what God is looking
[1:08:00] for
[1:08:03] today I like this word he says you are
[1:08:06] converted not you but Christ has come
[1:08:08] into you and has converted you your
[1:08:11] nature is dead in the old
[1:08:14] man amen and you are a new creature a
[1:08:17] born again Christian you are a new
[1:08:20] man
[1:08:22] watch amen
[1:08:25] what was the Holy Ghost given for there
[1:08:28] the prophet of God is trying to explain
[1:08:31] the life of Peter he says oh my dear
[1:08:33] friends from around this country in this
[1:08:36] little city he said if I could only with
[1:08:39] my human voice Place into your heart the
[1:08:42] importance of receiving the baptism of
[1:08:45] the Holy Ghost it would be the most
[1:08:48] wonderful Revelation that you ever had
[1:08:51] in your
[1:08:52] life he says let me make that clear
[1:08:55] about you are not
[1:08:58] converted it says Peter had been saved
[1:09:01] he believed on the Lord followed him
[1:09:04] Jesus told him who he was had him to
[1:09:06] follow him he gave him the power against
[1:09:08] unclean spirits and Sanctified him but
[1:09:11] after all of that and Peter become the
[1:09:15] chief spokesman of that group as the
[1:09:18] Catholic would want to call it the
[1:09:20] bishop of the church or the pope or
[1:09:22] whatever it is the headman of the church
[1:09:25] yet Jesus said the night of his betrayal
[1:09:29] lovest thou me
[1:09:30] Peter and he said Lord you know I love
[1:09:35] you feed my sheep he said that three
[1:09:38] times and Peter said you know I love you
[1:09:41] till I go with you to the end and I will
[1:09:44] go with you unto
[1:09:47] death he said before the has crowed
[1:09:51] three times before the crows you
[1:09:54] will have denied me three
[1:09:56] times he said but Peter I have prayed
[1:10:00] for you amen listen that's not all of it
[1:10:03] I have prayed for you and after you are
[1:10:06] converted then strengthen your brethren

[1:12:38] of the Holy Ghost he refused it and he
[1:12:40] betrayed Jesus and that was the

[1:33:34] says it talks about the disobedient to
[1:33:37] be handed over to the
[1:33:39] enemy that's
[1:33:41] true if we don't pay attention to the
[1:33:45] warnings of
[1:33:46] God God himself will hand over us into
[1:33:51] the hands of the Mammon
[1:33:54] hand this man over to Satan for the
[1:33:56] destruction of the flesh flesh so that
[1:33:58] his Spirit may be saved on the day of
[1:34:01] the
[1:34:04] Lord brothers sisters we should be aware
[1:34:08] of the Trap today the Trap of the enemy
[1:34:11] the Trap Of Satan 2 Corinthians 2:1 says
[1:34:15] in order that Satan should not out with
[1:34:18] us for we are not unaware of his
[1:34:21] schemes right his devices we are not
[1:34:25] ignorant of his
[1:34:29] devices he wants to sift you as a wheat

[1:34:35] God for
[1:34:37] prayers thank God the prayers of our
[1:34:40] parents am brother John if I today
[1:34:44] holding this word of God is because of
[1:34:48] the prayers of my
[1:34:50] parents thank you Lord
[1:34:53] my
[1:34:54] friends which with whom I studied in
[1:34:58] Bombay most of my friends they are in
[1:35:01] world today they're in the big Mafia M
[1:35:04] underworld
[1:35:06] gangs few of them have been shot dead
[1:35:12] killed now and then when I go to Bombay
[1:35:16] if they come to know that I've come they
[1:35:18] come to meet
[1:35:21] me they tell me if you have any need

[1:35:42] miss my father and mother
[1:35:45] today they used to always pray for us
[1:35:49] children my daddy would cry out said
[1:35:52] Lord as I walk with you you let my
[1:35:54] children walk with
[1:35:59] you that's why this word of God this
[1:36:03] word of the spirit is in my hands
[1:36:09] today if I am able to make a change or a
[1:36:13] difference in the life of the poor
[1:36:15] people or people under me it's just
[1:36:18] because of the prayers of my
[1:36:21] parents it's God's grace
[1:36:26] am it's the Holy Ghost which has
[1:36:29] converted me which has transformed
[1:36:31] me which is allowing me to bring a
[1:36:34] change in somebody's
[1:36:40] life we cannot be ignorant of the
[1:36:44] schemes of the
[1:36:51] enemy look at another
[1:36:54] example about Paul and his
[1:36:59] life he was also tried so many
[1:37:04] times all his life if there was anybody
[1:37:07] who got more trials and test that was
[1:37:12] Paul but look what he says in the midst
[1:37:16] of all this he says I have kept the
[1:37:21] faith Paul lost his head they cut that
[1:37:25] off but it didn't touch his
[1:37:31] faith I got gooseb brother when I was
[1:37:34] reading
[1:37:35] that Paul lost his
[1:37:39] head they could touch his head but not
[1:37:42] his
[1:37:45] faith that's why he boldly said I have
[1:37:48] kept the faith I have fought a good
[1:37:51] fight amen he rejoiced in three things
[1:37:55] this great Apostle to the Gentiles what
[1:37:58] are those three things he said I have
[1:38:00] fought a good fight I have
[1:38:02] finished my course and I have kept the
[1:38:09] faith are we in that position today to
[1:38:11] say
[1:38:13] that I have fought a good fire the other
[1:38:16] day brother John I went to a a cemetery
[1:38:19] a
[1:38:20] graveyard and there were people whom I
[1:38:22] know
[1:38:24] I saw their graves everybody has
[1:38:26] engraved I have fought a good fight of
[1:38:30] faith and you know I've kept my
[1:38:32] faith and when you see their life they
[1:38:35] were big
[1:38:38] drunkards they were worldly people they
[1:38:40] were they were big Sinners they did not
[1:38:43] even care for the church for the word of
[1:38:46] God they did not live right but when
[1:38:49] they are
[1:38:50] dead the family members have engraved
[1:38:57] yeah but if you can really sit and
[1:39:01] think are we in a position
[1:39:05] today to say what Paul
[1:39:10] said think about it I think all the
[1:39:14] time I have fought a good
[1:39:17] fight finished my course and I have kept
[1:39:22] the faith
[1:39:26] what did all the rest amount
[1:39:29] to he said I count it
[1:39:32] all zero I count it all nothing I count
[1:39:36] it all as
[1:39:38] D Paul won the race Paul gained the
[1:39:41] prize Paul has the admiration of Earth
[1:39:44] today and also the admiration of
[1:39:49] Heaven the whole earth is rejoicing
[1:39:52] about Paul today the whole Heaven also
[1:39:55] rejoiced about
[1:40:00] Paul why do we not act as if it paid to
[1:40:03] lose all to win
[1:40:07] Christ why are we not loyal to truth as
[1:40:10] Paul
[1:40:14] was you know we don't have his
[1:40:18] mathematics that's true what he counted
[1:40:21] we can't count it the same way
[1:40:24] he counted differently from us we count
[1:40:27] the things gained that he counted
[1:40:31] loss we must have his faith and keep it
[1:40:35] if we could wear the same
[1:40:41] Crown before I
[1:40:43] close I want you to think on this lines
[1:40:49] are we fighting that good fight
[1:40:55] are we in that race or are we going to
[1:40:58] finish that
[1:41:00] course how are we keeping the
[1:41:04] faith my brothers my
[1:41:07] sisters Prophet said we are living in
[1:41:10] the end time and the Revival fires are
[1:41:13] burning low yes amen puru and is say
[1:41:17] Revival doesn't last very long but this
[1:41:20] has been going for years because it's
[1:41:22] last Revival I believe and that we are
[1:41:25] right at the end
[1:41:28] time but he says but we can see the
[1:41:30] Revival fire is burning down low the
[1:41:33] interest of the people everybody is
[1:41:36] tired going to sleep interest is gone
[1:41:39] and to see this much interest among the
[1:41:42] people here it Thrills me and know that
[1:41:45] there is still fire
[1:41:48] burning and he says let's fan it tonight
[1:41:52] just have as we can with the
[1:42:00] word and the word when you fan it will
[1:42:03] produce the Holy Spirit right the
[1:42:06] rushing Mighty Wind that will start the
[1:42:09] fire burning
[1:42:12] again he says may the Lord grant it to
[1:42:17] you what we need
[1:42:20] today I can sit here for the whole day
[1:42:23] and talk to
[1:42:26] you but what do we really need what more

[1:44:52] blessed blessing to others I want to be
[1:44:55] a blessing to
[1:44:57] someone but before I could be a blessing

[1:45:08] word of God in my life David said I hid
[1:45:13] Thy word in my heart oh

[1:47:56] light what is light the Vindicated
[1:48:00] spoken word of God Amen is the light of
[1:48:04] this hour true so
[1:48:07] true the prophet said don't live in the
[1:48:11] glare of another light don't live in the
[1:48:14] glare of another
[1:48:16] age walk in the light because Jesus is
