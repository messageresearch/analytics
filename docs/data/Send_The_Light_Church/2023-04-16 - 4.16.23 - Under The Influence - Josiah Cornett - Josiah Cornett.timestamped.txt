[0:00] daily lives Lord and to assure their
[0:03] final destination Lord there's and be
[0:05] certain of their salvation father and
[0:07] their relationship with you for granted
[0:09] dear Lord may they be certain other
[0:10] relationship with each other Lord when
[0:12] they leave this place Lord to know that
[0:14] all hearts are clear Lord there's no
[0:16] barriers between you vertically and
[0:18] there's no barriers horizontally between
[0:20] them and another person Lord or just to
[0:23] live clear and purposeful Lord as as you
[0:26] would have us to live granted Lord we
[0:29] pray that you'd open this word now to us
[0:30] Lord and open your heart father and may
[0:33] each heart be here be open to you in
[0:35] Jesus Christ's name amen
[0:37] amen God bless you as you received this
[0:39] morning
[0:40] praise the Lord we've got the wireless
[0:42] microphone
[0:52] I need to take my jacket
[1:09] it's no good to uh
[1:12] I guess some advances can work with one
[1:14] one arm tie behind their back like that
[1:15] but I'm some something in my bloodline
[1:18] maybe the Italian or the Irish or
[1:20] something I have to move my hands around
[1:22] when I talk right brother Bruce so we we
[1:24] like to have those hands-free but what
[1:26] I'd like to preach on this morning if I
[1:28] could have your attention and I
[1:30] certainly appreciate you coming out to
[1:31] hear the word this morning but I'd like
[1:33] to preach and take the topic of under
[1:34] the influence
[1:36] under the influence
[1:38] and we take this scripture here this
[1:40] morning
[1:41] on wine to not be drunk with wine
[1:44] whereas in excess but to be filled with
[1:46] the spirit
[1:47] and there's something about wine
[1:50] there's something about wine that it it
[1:52] has a power to bring us under some kind
[1:55] of an influence that's why when you
[1:57] drink too much of it well not you I'm
[1:59] sure that you all wouldn't drink too
[2:01] much of it but when a person would drink
[2:03] too much of it they
[2:05] come underneath what they call Under the
[2:08] Influence that's why you get a DIY for
[2:10] driving Under the Influence is that
[2:12] right you're driving intoxicated you're
[2:15] driving under the influence of alcohol
[2:16] but and that's the thing about wine is
[2:19] the wine itself is there's nothing wrong
[2:21] with with what the wine originally was
[2:23] right but there's there's a power behind
[2:26] the wine that power of the alcohol
[2:28] that's inside the wine to bring you
[2:30] under its influence
[2:31] and matter of fact when wine started out
[2:34] it was something very innocent just
[2:36] sitting on a table somewhere and it was
[2:39] just a bunch of grape juice
[2:41] but you give it the right atmosphere you
[2:43] give it the right conditions you give it
[2:44] the right amount of time and you find
[2:47] that it develops within it some kind of
[2:49] an influence
[2:50] and there's certain things that I think
[2:52] that if we allow in our lives and we
[2:53] allow them to sit there in our lives and
[2:56] sit there long enough there becomes an
[2:59] influence that comes underneath that an
[3:01] influence that can when we look back
[3:03] along our life's Trail and if we if we
[3:06] don't pay attention we get
[3:07] our kids are all grown up and we see
[3:10] them going certain ways and we we see
[3:12] them doing certain things even as they
[3:13] start to learn how to talk and start to
[3:16] say things they're like where did you
[3:18] get that from I've got a five-year-old
[3:20] back there and sometimes like where did
[3:21] you get that from and you start being a
[3:24] little circumspect and you look back and
[3:25] said oh
[3:27] there's something that I let sit there
[3:29] and he he got it from that
[3:31] so there's there's a power that like
[3:35] wine there's things that we allow into
[3:37] our lives that if we're not careful they
[3:39] have the power to bring an influence in
[3:41] us and we have to be
[3:43] looking at that from a thinking man's
[3:45] filter
[3:46] is that influence something that's
[3:47] influencing me towards eternity or has
[3:50] it influence me toward damnation is it
[3:53] influencing my family who's not yet
[3:55] saved yet not yet filled with the Holy
[3:57] Ghost these little children is it
[3:58] influencing them towards eternity or is
[4:01] it influencing them towards accepting
[4:04] the ways the world which goes down to
[4:06] the pit
[4:07] so wine itself is not the issue but
[4:09] there's something behind that wine that
[4:11] gives its power over us and likewise
[4:13] when we talk about let's say a TV a TV
[4:16] is not the issue in itself brother
[4:18] Brandon even said that it could have
[4:19] been used for great good but what
[4:21] happened is people let something else
[4:22] come behind that technology and now we
[4:25] see by and large the bulk of what comes
[4:28] out of Hollywood is something that will
[4:30] send your soul to hell
[4:32] it has an influence behind it
[4:35] you look at some modern examples for
[4:37] today you look at advertising and
[4:39] culture even
[4:40] and you see that there's an influence
[4:42] behind
[4:43] what the advertiser is trying to get to
[4:46] you
[4:47] they flash up so many pictures of of
[4:50] women on the Billboards and women here
[4:52] and and women in advertising until it's
[4:54] it's nothing to see someone in their
[4:56] underwear anymore it's nothing to walk
[4:58] through Nordstroms or Walmart or or
[5:01] wherever you would frequent and and pass
[5:03] by and see a woman completely scanly
[5:05] dressed down to her just her underneath
[5:07] garments and because of that regular
[5:11] putting it in front of people it dumbs
[5:13] down the culture so there's no more
[5:15] shock value
[5:17] but yet there's an influence there still
[5:20] residing amen that's not grape juice
[5:22] that's sitting on your counter but
[5:24] there's an influence behind that that if
[5:25] you allow it to stay in your life
[5:28] and you allow that to be your normal
[5:30] along with this culture's normal
[5:32] then it has the possibility
[5:34] to ruin your life
[5:36] you look at maybe for example what this
[5:40] world is now doing they they take
[5:42] what was once completely socially taboo
[5:46] and they first start to rationalize it
[5:49] like oh the animals do that the animal
[5:51] kingdom they work in this sort of way
[5:54] and they'll take homosexuality and
[5:56] they'll start to rationalize it well I I
[5:58] want to tell you first of all I'm not an
[6:00] animal and I didn't come from animal
[6:03] matter of fact animal was underneath me
[6:05] and when I fell when human race fell
[6:07] underneath Adam all animal kind fell
[6:11] but yet they'll take those things and
[6:12] they'll rationalize it and it goes from
[6:14] rationalized to being accepted and from
[6:17] being accepted it goes to being
[6:18] normalized and it's no longer just
[6:21] normalized anymore today now it's
[6:23] celebrated now it's now it's it's it's
[6:25] thrown out in the open not just we want
[6:27] to we we we want to be accepted but we
[6:30] want to be proud full of this and and
[6:33] this is something to be you know to say
[6:35] oh that's how you are oh you're gay
[6:38] you're this that or the other you let's
[6:41] let's celebrate that let's let's let's
[6:42] recognize this person as the woman of
[6:45] the year and that's not even a woman
[6:46] that's a man tried to make themselves
[6:49] look like a woman but we'll celebrate it
[6:51] now no longer accepting it not not just
[6:53] saying on the sidelines that's okay but
[6:55] we're bringing you into our culture and
[6:57] saying that's wonderful it goes from
[7:00] rationalized to being okay to being
[7:02] wonderful to being pervasive because
[7:05] once you make something wonderful other
[7:07] people want it
[7:09] and so now our whole culture is being
[7:11] brought underneath the influence of this
[7:14] Modern Age the influence of the lgbtq
[7:17] movement the influence of what this
[7:20] culture says normal
[7:22] have you ever heard the term culture
[7:24] shock
[7:25] how many has ever traveled to another
[7:27] country
[7:28] we've got a few
[7:30] and how when when you landed in the
[7:33] other country I'm not talking Canada I'm
[7:35] talking like another continent or
[7:36] something they have a different way of
[7:38] doing things don't they
[7:40] and you come to that country and you say
[7:43] my they they do that their their
[7:46] weddings are like that that's how their
[7:49] wedding ceremony is that's that's how
[7:50] they conduct business and everything
[7:52] about it
[7:54] everything about that Society
[7:57] shocks you doesn't it there's there's
[7:59] that culture shock
[8:01] and maybe you're a little bit judgy and
[8:03] you say well I that's not the right way
[8:05] to get married and that's not the right
[8:07] way to close a deal and that's not the
[8:09] right way to go about your regular life
[8:11] inside your family and
[8:14] and you find out that's just culture
[8:17] but there is a Godly culture
[8:20] and there is a culture of the world
[8:23] and we have to be careful that we don't
[8:25] just start accepting our culture as
[8:28] being the right way of doing things
[8:31] and and that's why I think it's for one
[8:33] thing it's it's so great to know what
[8:35] other cultures are because it gives you
[8:37] some kind of perspective to judge your
[8:39] own Culture by and to realize that your
[8:42] culture is not the the de facto standard
[8:46] for judging how to do things
[8:48] and neither is their culture you find
[8:51] out that all men have gone astray
[8:54] all men need salvation all men need God
[8:58] and all cultures are corrupt but don't
[9:01] let your culture become so normal to you
[9:04] that you just keep on accepting these
[9:07] things
[9:10] so what else is out there right now I I
[9:13] I turn to what we look at the the online
[9:16] influencers today if they're not even
[9:18] they're not even considered uh wolf in
[9:21] the sheep's clothing anymore they're
[9:22] actually saying hey my name is an
[9:24] influencer that's what I'm doing it's
[9:26] like it's like I'm going to take the
[9:28] sheep's clothing off and I'm going to
[9:29] tell you I am here to influence your
[9:31] life right
[9:32] I am here on YouTube and I am here to
[9:34] make money to influence your life
[9:37] and yet our society and it's in its
[9:41] crazed fashion drives to YouTube and
[9:43] drives to Instagram and drives to tick
[9:45] tock in Hoards so that they can find
[9:48] someone to influence their life and why
[9:51] is that it's because people are sheep
[9:54] I'm not saying people and sheep like the
[9:56] Republicans talk about people being
[9:57] sheep oh that's just a sheep you're just
[10:00] a sheep you just need to be led by
[10:02] somebody no no no God was the first one
[10:05] to call us sheep and when God called us
[10:08] sheep he said it in a loving way he said
[10:10] I built you to be a sheep I designed you
[10:13] to be a sheep because I want to be your
[10:15] Shepherd I made you I made your heart in
[10:18] a way that it looks for someone to lead
[10:20] you but when this culture when this
[10:23] society when this world goes to someone
[10:26] on YouTube and goes to some other Fallen
[10:28] man and says I'm going to look for them
[10:30] to them for my lifestyle
[10:32] you're going to the wrong source
[10:38] go on to YouTube and you finally find
[10:40] all sorts of parents that want to tell
[10:41] tell you how to be a parent tell you how
[10:44] to parent your child
[10:45] and they'll they'll say let we just
[10:47] bought this 500 000 RV and we're gonna
[10:50] pack up our whole family and we're going
[10:53] to go around the entire country and
[10:55] spend our life
[10:58] just going places
[11:00] and that's the ideal of a family let's
[11:03] do stuff and see things and that's the
[11:06] ideal
[11:08] and we'll look at that
[11:10] and we'll say my they're getting to see
[11:13] the world they're getting to do all the
[11:15] things I I I wish I could have done when
[11:17] I was little I I could do that for my
[11:20] family if I could just you know find a
[11:23] five thousand dollar camper off of
[11:25] Facebook Marketplace and attach it to my
[11:27] little run-down rusty truck and try to
[11:29] make it out west and and now we're we're
[11:32] building all these things in our mind
[11:33] how we can emulate these big images that
[11:36] we see online right
[11:38] without stopping to ask ourselves what
[11:40] is it about that family that they could
[11:42] pull up all the roots
[11:44] and unplug from a church family unplug
[11:48] from a community unplug from
[11:51] grandmas and their grandpas that would
[11:53] influence their children and just leave
[11:56] everyone behind
[11:58] there's something that's not being shown
[12:00] it's like a magic trick you you get
[12:03] everybody's attention over here but
[12:05] there's something over here that's
[12:06] making it work
[12:08] and when somebody shows you a bunch of
[12:10] Disney Magic a bunch of magic that looks
[12:12] so wonderful that you want to sh that
[12:14] you want to seek after it you got to ask
[12:16] yourself what is it over here that
[12:18] you're not seeing and there's something
[12:21] in those people's hearts that's causing
[12:23] them to do those things
[12:25] when you jump on there and you see the
[12:27] girls that look so fashionable and and
[12:30] they're wearing the clothes on Tick Tock
[12:32] and they've got all the dance moves and
[12:34] they've got all the and they've got all
[12:35] the lifestyle and they've got the health
[12:37] activity and they've they've seen like
[12:39] they've got all the organizational
[12:40] smarts together and their children are
[12:42] like little ducks in a row that are just
[12:44] they jump right out of the front page of
[12:46] some kind of clothing advertisement and
[12:48] everything's perfect
[12:50] and you want to make your family just
[12:52] like that
[12:53] remember it's a magic act they're
[12:57] showing you this but remember there's
[12:59] something over here that's causing their
[13:02] family to balance way over here
[13:05] and you've got to ask yourself is that
[13:07] what I want to follow after is that the
[13:10] influence that I want to bring my family
[13:12] under
[13:15] and so they'll they'll they'll tell you
[13:17] what you should do for your health and
[13:19] how to organize your home and how to
[13:21] make it just look like like uh like it
[13:24] just jumped off of HDTV
[13:27] and all the time there's these subtle
[13:29] signals going out this is the important
[13:32] things these are the Ten Commandments
[13:34] for your life and the Ten Commandment
[13:36] isn't to honor God it's not to come to
[13:39] church it's not to not commit adultery
[13:42] it's not to not steal or have false
[13:45] witness it's these are our priorities
[13:48] we want to look good we want to feel
[13:51] good we want to have other people see us
[13:54] as good
[13:55] we want to experience things whether
[13:58] it's in an RV or some kind of
[14:01] um
[14:02] some kind of party life or whatever it
[14:04] is they're trying to show you their
[14:07] priorities but you've got to ask
[14:09] yourself what priorities and all of this
[14:11] are being left behind
[14:14] Psalm says it this way blessed is the
[14:16] man that walketh not in the counsel of
[14:20] the ungodly
[14:21] and you might say but it's also written
[14:23] in the multitude of counselors there's
[14:25] safety I just want to get on YouTube I
[14:28] just want to get on Facebook and see
[14:30] what people are doing
[14:32] but remember and
[14:34] when you walk in the Council of the
[14:36] ungodly
[14:38] you won't be blessed amen we're not even
[14:41] talking you read that scripture there
[14:43] and you read down in Psalms 1 that's the
[14:46] first level walking the counseling Godly
[14:49] later on it stocks talks about sitting
[14:51] in the seat of the scornful and and so
[14:54] on we're not talking about scornful
[14:56] people we're not talking about the
[14:58] mockers we're not talking about the base
[15:00] of society we're just saying the person
[15:03] who doesn't want who walks in the
[15:05] Council of the ungodly
[15:07] he's not going to be blessed
[15:09] what's the ungodly it just simply means
[15:12] those without God
[15:14] because they are sheep without a
[15:16] shepherd
[15:17] the blind following the blind yeah
[15:20] and they may be good people they may be
[15:22] moral people that that hold to
[15:25] Conventional morals like the Golden Rule
[15:27] and being nice and kind and being
[15:31] contributors to society and being
[15:33] generous but if they don't have God in
[15:36] their lives
[15:37] they are sheep without a Shepherd
[15:39] they're blind fall in the Blind and if
[15:42] you walk in their counsel you'll be
[15:44] following the blind fall in the blind
[15:46] following the blind
[15:47] matter of fact you'll be worse because
[15:49] you have sight this morning you have the
[15:52] word of God you have the light of the
[15:54] end time this morning and yet you would
[15:56] choose to be the sight of those who have
[16:00] sight walking after the blind who are
[16:02] walking off the blind why would you turn
[16:05] away from that and close your eyes in
[16:07] this last day
[16:09] and walk after those who are walking
[16:10] after the blind
[16:13] don't be found one with sight who is
[16:16] walking after the sightless
[16:18] but make sure that you're not walking
[16:20] the counsel of the ungodly amen
[16:23] Amen in Proverbs it says that wine is a
[16:25] mocker and strong drink raging he who is
[16:28] deceived thereby is not wise
[16:32] the influences of this world
[16:35] want to mock your life
[16:41] can I just bring it real this morning
[16:43] give you a little bit of a real example
[16:45] you know what I found to be a mocker in
[16:47] my life
[16:48] HGTV
[16:50] you know what HGTV was a mocker in my
[16:53] life
[16:54] because I I got this uh I got this this
[16:57] subscription to the Discovery Channel
[16:59] for my kid I wanted to show them these
[17:01] these uh uh what do you call the
[17:05] documentaries and the sea creatures and
[17:07] so on I thought that Discovery Channel
[17:08] would have a lot of that so I got a free
[17:10] subscription to Discovery Channel and I
[17:12] loaded it up and just one click over was
[17:15] HGTV
[17:17] and you know you've got all the Home
[17:19] Improvement stuff I didn't want to watch
[17:20] too much of that because if if Joanna
[17:22] Gaines got on there she might influence
[17:24] my wife and then I'd have to all these
[17:26] home projects and a big honey-do list
[17:27] and I I didn't want that but there they
[17:31] had you know that they had the the real
[17:33] estate and I loved every house I ever
[17:36] bought in my life I I loved buying it
[17:38] the whole process I I loved it and now I
[17:41] can watch other people go through the
[17:43] process of buying a house
[17:45] and of course on HGTV none of them have
[17:48] budgets like I have you know you just
[17:50] you just like as soon as they say uh the
[17:53] whole the whole format if you've never
[17:54] watched it they come in and they they
[17:56] meet at the realtor and they say this
[17:57] the budget we have and this is the house
[17:59] that we're happy that we want to look
[18:01] for and then they go and look for three
[18:03] houses and then they're like hmm what
[18:06] kind of house am I gonna pick and you're
[18:08] cheering for the house that you want the
[18:09] whole time and then they pick the other
[18:11] house that you don't want and um and
[18:14] that's how it works well as soon as they
[18:15] say a budget that's like less than half
[18:17] a million dollars you're like next
[18:18] episode nobody wants to watch that
[18:22] I I don't want to watch me I want to I
[18:24] want to watch the guy that's the next
[18:25] step above me right so that's how the
[18:27] human mind is working I wanna what do
[18:30] the rich guys have
[18:31] so we I watched a couple of those and
[18:34] come to find out they they don't just
[18:36] have regular episodes they've got cabins
[18:39] in the Rockies episodes and they've got
[18:40] cabins in Montana episodes and then
[18:43] they've got uh you know Timber framed
[18:47] housing episodes and the whole season is
[18:49] dedicated to just exactly the kind of
[18:51] house that you would want if you were to
[18:53] buy your dream house and you know some
[18:55] people get in the teeth into into sports
[18:57] and things and and get all excited I got
[19:00] excited about HGTV
[19:02] and these guys were on there and and
[19:04] they'd buy this they look at this cabin
[19:06] they look at the one with 15 acres and
[19:08] the one with three acres and the one
[19:09] with half an acre on the lake and then
[19:11] they go with the one with half an acre
[19:13] on the lake and I just about take my
[19:14] shoe off and throw it at the screen
[19:15] because why would you buy a cabin
[19:17] with half an acre
[19:19] if you're gonna buy a half million
[19:21] dollar quarter Mill a million and a
[19:23] quarter
[19:25] buy something with some land get some
[19:27] Forest out there buy an ATV
[19:30] it's like well money was wasted on the
[19:32] wrong people
[19:35] and I thought this is all good fun until
[19:38] I pull up my phone a few days into
[19:41] watching these episodes and you know
[19:43] it's it's kind of funny when you get on
[19:45] your phone you're not really thinking
[19:46] it's kind of you watch your thumb and it
[19:48] kind of shows you what your heart's
[19:50] thinking
[19:52] and I kind of watched my thumb
[19:54] and it clicked over to Zillow and
[19:57] clicked over to Toledo Ohio
[20:01] typed in cabins as a filter
[20:04] I'm like there's no cabins in Toledo
[20:07] Ohio
[20:08] why do I even live in Toledo Ohio
[20:12] why didn't my family raise me in this
[20:15] area why couldn't we have moved out to
[20:17] Colorado in the first place and and and
[20:19] and and and why do I have to have such a
[20:22] small budget for a house and why is my
[20:24] house the way I had to stop myself
[20:27] because something was becoming a mocker
[20:29] in my life
[20:31] because I know that God gave me the
[20:33] house I'm in God God put it in my heart
[20:37] to live closer to my church community
[20:38] and we sold our home two years ago and
[20:40] and moved closer and and we gave up the
[20:43] property that we had and and sized down
[20:45] from 10 acres to one acre and and and
[20:47] and and and left it all behind us and
[20:50] said we want to be where the church
[20:51] family is we want the fellowship we want
[20:53] to be in communication we want to be in
[20:54] connection with our church
[20:56] and and the whole testimony from
[20:58] beginning to end how that whole thing
[20:59] played out I know that was the testimony
[21:02] of Jesus Christ in my in my life and now
[21:06] something's coming along HGD HGTV is
[21:10] coming along and mocking the testimony
[21:12] of God in my life
[21:15] oh I wonder if this is starting to hit
[21:17] home with someone this morning
[21:19] do you see how our culture wants to mock
[21:21] God's testimony in your life he wants to
[21:24] mock the very gifts
[21:26] that God gives you that's Satan's goal
[21:28] not just not just a physical gift like
[21:31] your first home or or whatever family
[21:34] Homestead you have he wants to mock the
[21:36] holy ghost in your life he wants to mock
[21:39] the upbringing that's in your life he
[21:41] wants to mock the good things they've
[21:42] been put in your life and cause you to
[21:44] go out and throw those in the street and
[21:47] follow after the world
[21:50] like some kind of a prodigal
[21:53] but God says the prodigal
[21:56] come home
[21:58] they're still riches here there's still
[22:00] a family here there's still open arms to
[22:03] receive you here this morning and
[22:05] there's still a life for you
[22:07] and I've made it good and all that
[22:10] that's out in the world
[22:11] that wants to mock you
[22:13] and will one day not just mock what you
[22:15] had but mock what you are
[22:17] because wasn't that the end of The
[22:19] Prodigal Son
[22:20] when he followed that road to its
[22:22] terminal destination he had friends and
[22:25] he had a good time for a while but at
[22:27] the end of the road he was spent
[22:30] and he was left with no friends
[22:34] wine is a mocker
[22:38] you know what else is a mocker
[22:41] Facebook
[22:42] and social media is a mocker
[22:46] you know because when I get on Facebook
[22:47] and I can have just come off a greatest
[22:51] family vacation of my life I'll get on
[22:53] Facebook Monday morning at work
[22:57] not at work you know lunch hour come on
[23:00] give me a break
[23:03] I'll be like man that crate was a great
[23:05] family vacation but I could load up
[23:06] Facebook and see somebody else bragging
[23:08] about their family vacation they're on
[23:10] right now
[23:11] and I'll be like
[23:13] that wasn't such a great family vacation
[23:16] they're in Florida and I'm stuck up here
[23:19] in Michigan still and it's still cold
[23:24] Facebook is a mocker social media Will
[23:27] Mock your life and make the blessings of
[23:30] God look small in comparison with
[23:32] somebody else's highlight reels
[23:35] and we know at least the if we have
[23:38] wisdom about us we know that that's not
[23:41] truth we know they're not showing us
[23:43] their bad days they're only showing us
[23:44] their good days there's a reason why
[23:46] their post is the first post in 37 days
[23:50] it's because the other 37 Days weren't
[23:52] worth bragging about but now they've got
[23:54] something worth bragging about so they
[23:56] are
[23:57] they've got something worth sharing
[23:58] we'll say
[24:01] but yet we'll let social media get up
[24:04] there and and tear us down and mock us
[24:06] do you know that our suicide rate among
[24:08] young children
[24:10] and and even even Generation Z is
[24:12] skyrocketing depression during covet was
[24:16] out of hand
[24:18] because people get on these devices and
[24:21] they have no life and they look at other
[24:23] people who they perceive do have a life
[24:27] and they said what's my life worth
[24:28] living
[24:30] so it's time for us to set down these
[24:32] devices and go find a life in Jesus
[24:35] Christ to not let ourselves be brought
[24:38] underneath these influences
[24:42] you know it's it's um it's remarkable to
[24:44] me we talk about wine being a mocker as
[24:46] a as an
[24:48] as an analogy this morning if I was
[24:50] talking to my friend over in in Maine
[24:53] and he's he's a part of a church over
[24:55] there and they get a lot of people that
[24:57] come over from the Congo in different
[24:59] places and you know I'd always hear
[25:01] about the people in other countries and
[25:03] especially third world countries how
[25:05] they would walk both ways to
[25:08] to church and they would walk all days
[25:10] all day to get there and there was
[25:11] something that was so remarkable in my
[25:13] heart that someone would spend their
[25:16] whole Sunday
[25:17] just to get to church
[25:20] and in the Congo if you if you know the
[25:23] the the the the the the
[25:24] light that we have is is so remarkably
[25:28] spread throughout the Congo it's it's
[25:29] one of the
[25:31] if it was to be called the denomination
[25:32] it's one of the top denominations in the
[25:35] area so one of the top ways of faith if
[25:37] you can say that of course we we
[25:39] understand that it's not a denomination
[25:40] but the people that make the record
[25:42] books there in that area don't
[25:44] understand that and churches are in the
[25:46] thousands
[25:48] and but yet in every Church you have a
[25:51] make-believer you have an unbeliever and
[25:54] you have a True Believer in every Church
[25:56] and so they're all walking to church
[25:59] maybe but I was I was I was so impressed
[26:02] with just just that that sacrifice that
[26:04] diligence
[26:06] but yet my friend in Maine was telling
[26:07] me that
[26:08] you can see some of them when they came
[26:10] over they seemed the first thing that
[26:12] they wanted to try was alcohol
[26:15] because they couldn't get their hands on
[26:16] it back in their home country
[26:19] or they they kind of got underneath out
[26:21] from under the influencer of mom and dad
[26:23] from their home country and now they're
[26:24] they found their way to America and and
[26:27] they have access to it and as soon as
[26:29] they as soon as they got a hold that you
[26:31] see you say the next thing I saw is they
[26:33] they were out of church
[26:35] and so it
[26:37] it's our society right
[26:39] and we always want to imagine
[26:43] what our what our struggle with maybe
[26:46] and downplay what God has put us in
[26:50] say well
[26:52] those people over there in Africa
[26:53] they're they're such real true
[26:55] Christians and and I'm over here in
[26:57] America and what am I doing for the Lord
[27:01] but just the fact that you're called for
[27:04] laodicea
[27:06] this day and again that that thing about
[27:09] that thing about it's culture shock you
[27:12] don't realize how much pressure you are
[27:14] under every single day
[27:18] because you're climatized to it it's
[27:20] normal for you
[27:22] but this is just a reminder the kind of
[27:25] pressure you can you are under every
[27:26] single day someone from Africa comes
[27:29] over and it's enough to break them if
[27:31] they're not strong
[27:33] but yet you are strong you hear this you
[27:35] were strong enough to get out of bed on
[27:37] a Sunday morning at 9 00 a.m and get to
[27:39] church by 9 30. and be here this morning
[27:42] to hear the word and take it home in
[27:43] your hearts and and be stronger for the
[27:45] Lord tomorrow
[27:46] so there's something in you that that
[27:48] was enough to get you here this morning
[27:50] there was something in you that that no
[27:51] matter what this no matter what this
[27:53] culture is the the darkest days that
[27:56] there ever was with high suicide rates
[27:58] and people that don't understand what
[27:59] their purpose in life is and they're
[28:01] just losing all hope and and depression
[28:03] when when America is the richest country
[28:05] in the world and yet we're dealing with
[28:07] depression like never before why is that
[28:09] it's because the age is dark
[28:12] and man has lost their way and their
[28:14] sheep without a shepherd but yet there
[28:16] was something strong enough in your
[28:17] heart this morning to reach out and say
[28:19] I'm going to church I'm going to find a
[28:22] way I'm not going to find my way I'm not
[28:24] going to find the way of the influencers
[28:26] I'm going to find the way of the Lord
[28:28] because I know that in that way there is
[28:30] salvation and that way there's goodness
[28:32] and that way there is happiness and joy
[28:35] and peace and prosperity in the Holy
[28:37] Spirit
[28:39] the Bible says this in first Timothy
[28:41] they that be rich fall into temptation
[28:43] and the snare and into many foolish and
[28:47] hurtful lusts
[28:49] which drown men in destruction and
[28:51] perdition
[28:52] they that be rich you say oh yeah I
[28:54] believe Elon Musk is having a real hard
[28:57] time with
[28:58] foolish and hurtful losts but did you
[29:01] know that the median income of the world
[29:04] globally after adjusting for cost of
[29:06] living in the disparate regions is about
[29:10] twenty thousand dollars I'm sorry ten
[29:12] thousand dollars per household
[29:14] or about 2 900 per capita
[29:17] that's a after adjusting for cost of
[29:19] living
[29:20] that means in most the world
[29:23] people figure out how to live with their
[29:25] family
[29:27] on ten thousand dollars
[29:29] imagine that
[29:31] you'd be saying well I I couldn't even
[29:33] pay the electric bill they don't
[29:35] that's why most the world doesn't have
[29:37] electricity if you're looking on a per
[29:39] capita basis
[29:41] well I'd be living in a hut a lot of
[29:43] people do live in a hut
[29:45] so
[29:46] who I'm speaking to this morning
[29:49] is the people that first Timothy is
[29:51] talking about they that be rich
[29:54] Fallen Temptation the snare there are
[29:57] many foolish and hurtful lost out there
[29:59] and these devices that we have
[30:02] this is Satan's primary doorway
[30:05] to his primary snare if I can put it
[30:08] this way
[30:09] to capture you into the foolish and
[30:10] hurtful loss that are out there
[30:13] you know we talked about the door of
[30:15] Sodom and being at the door of Sodom how
[30:17] many remembers that story of lot and he
[30:19] there he was in the midst of Sodom and
[30:22] all these homosexuals were knocking down
[30:23] the door trying to get in and grab away
[30:25] his guest and he had to offer them his
[30:27] own family members
[30:29] they were knocking down the door now we
[30:30] have this phrase you know of for a dad
[30:33] to be at the door of Sodom to protect
[30:35] his family but you know the front door
[30:37] is not our doorway now well we'll have
[30:40] men with her big strong chest and go out
[30:42] and they'll buy a gun they'll buy a
[30:44] shotguns to say that I can protect my
[30:46] household and you know the I have a
[30:48] castle right and everything else but
[30:51] you're missing the right door
[30:52] you'll have a man that has a shotgun
[30:56] protecting the front door of his home
[30:58] and yet in the back room his children
[31:00] are loading up some device with a bunch
[31:02] of pornography on it and he's let every
[31:05] single other door in his house every
[31:07] single other door in his house wide open
[31:10] because he's not being circumspect he's
[31:12] not really guarding his household he's
[31:14] not applying the token he's not watching
[31:16] where those children are going
[31:18] right
[31:21] and wine is mocking his family that
[31:24] influence is mocking his family
[31:26] and those children are growing up
[31:27] underneath the influence of who knows
[31:29] what if he's not careful
[31:32] and they're walking out and they're
[31:33] saying how how do I ever get these
[31:36] things out of my mind
[31:37] right and and if he's not careful that
[31:40] that child is one day going to look back
[31:42] at him and say
[31:43] you let it in
[31:45] I didn't know how to deal with it I I
[31:47] when that popped up the first time I
[31:49] didn't know how to deal with it I wasn't
[31:51] even looking for it it came looking for
[31:53] me it came hunting me and there was no
[31:55] protector for me there was no one to
[31:57] cover me and you didn't do your job
[31:59] father you didn't do your job mother and
[32:02] I was left as a sheep without a shepherd
[32:05] and the walls were all around I
[32:07] succumbed to it
[32:10] and wine is a mocker and it mocks your
[32:13] family
[32:14] because we didn't rise to the occasion
[32:16] and I'm saying this is a clear message
[32:18] the fathers and the mothers that have
[32:20] little children this morning you need to
[32:22] rise to the occasion if you haven't
[32:23] beaten this mocker in your own life it's
[32:25] time to tear down that mocker it's time
[32:28] to submit your life over to the Lord and
[32:30] say Lord let me defeat this influence in
[32:32] my own life that I may cover my own
[32:34] children that they wouldn't fall prey to
[32:36] this
[32:38] because Satan wants to mock your life
[32:40] and he's not just content with that he
[32:42] wants to mock your family and he wants
[32:43] to turn your children to mockers that
[32:45] when they grow up one day they'll look
[32:47] back at you and mock everything that you
[32:48] believe and throw it in your face
[32:50] because you
[32:51] did not guard your children right to
[32:53] begin with
[32:58] be careful
[32:59] don't let the influence of this world
[33:01] get into your family
[33:03] don't let it become a mocker to you
[33:07] don't let it be that one day your kids
[33:09] are talking about my old man this and
[33:11] you're in your 80s and they're talking
[33:14] about my old man this and my old man
[33:15] this and when they talk to their friends
[33:17] at work they they just kind of joke
[33:18] about you
[33:20] let it be that you become a man of God
[33:22] friends
[33:23] that when your children grow up
[33:25] they'll talk about you and say
[33:28] yeah you might think I'm weird and yeah
[33:31] I don't
[33:32] I don't participate on all the jokes and
[33:35] I don't go to your drinking parties
[33:38] but I know
[33:40] that I'm going to be able to be in
[33:41] heaven one day
[33:43] I know where I stand I know my purpose
[33:46] in life I've got my head on my shoulders
[33:49] and I've got his word in my heart and I
[33:51] can say that
[33:52] because of my father because of my
[33:55] mother doing family devotions with me
[33:56] guarding me instilling the word of God
[33:58] In My Heart from when I was young
[34:00] I had that today I had that treasure
[34:03] and your children can exhibit a treasure
[34:05] to the world the world knows nothing
[34:07] about
[34:08] and it's they may never respect it in
[34:11] the way that they respect the online
[34:12] influencer but we're not here
[34:15] to win the awe and the accolades of the
[34:18] world
[34:19] we're here is that one day when we walk
[34:21] through those Pearly Gates we can hear
[34:23] the words well done
[34:25] my good and faithful servant amen enter
[34:28] into the joy of your reward
[34:33] kind of touch on just a couple more
[34:35] things this morning
[34:36] gateways that I see that
[34:39] this world is having its influence on us
[34:43] you know what is another
[34:45] huge mocker besides the internet and
[34:47] besides social media
[34:50] I see that Hollywood is a great mocker
[34:53] in our time
[34:54] I think it's gone even more so since
[34:57] covid when we were all locked in we had
[34:59] nothing to do we had to find some way to
[35:01] spend all that time
[35:05] I'll just be honest my wife and I have
[35:07] been going through this conversation a
[35:09] lot lately and I'm really sharing with
[35:11] you a lot that has been going on in our
[35:13] our home because during coven there were
[35:17] things that we just wanted some
[35:18] entertainment we just wanted a relief
[35:20] from pressure
[35:21] and we didn't always go to the right
[35:23] sources for that
[35:25] and I don't say there's no place for
[35:27] entertainment I don't say that there's
[35:28] no place for cartoons for your children
[35:30] I don't say there's no place for a a a
[35:32] an innocent movie but most of what
[35:36] Hollywood brings into our home
[35:38] Is Not Innocent
[35:40] and because of our culture and because
[35:42] of our lack of culture shock
[35:45] many Christians in the church today have
[35:48] lost their sense of judgment for what is
[35:50] innocent versus what the world calls
[35:53] innocent
[35:55] the world
[35:56] Hollywood wants to make a mockery of
[35:58] holiness
[35:59] in your family
[36:01] and wants to come in and you might say
[36:04] well I I I don't believe in adultery
[36:06] that's one of the Ten Commandments and I
[36:08] would never have that in my home but
[36:10] you'll come in and you'll let some man
[36:12] slop all over some woman right in your
[36:15] home
[36:16] and if it happened with your guest you'd
[36:18] throw them out but if it's happening on
[36:19] your screen well I'll just maybe turn my
[36:22] head for that
[36:23] but while you're turning your head your
[36:25] family's seeing that
[36:28] and there's something that rises up in
[36:29] the heart of a child when they see your
[36:31] values in contrast to your life
[36:34] and it's going to put mockery into their
[36:36] hearts
[36:37] and saying there's something there's
[36:38] something that doesn't add up
[36:40] and if you let that Fester
[36:42] that's a great way to raise a little
[36:44] mocker that one day looks back and say
[36:47] yeah Dad you preached it but you didn't
[36:49] live it
[36:51] you might say well that seems kind of
[36:53] strong but isn't it true that the world
[36:55] celebrates fornication today
[36:58] it it celebrates promiscuity it
[37:01] celebrates man and woman touching each
[37:02] other and they they may not show
[37:04] everything on screen
[37:05] but they sure allude to it they sure
[37:07] talk about it
[37:09] and if you don't rise to the occasion
[37:10] say well we're just kind of going to let
[37:12] that go through one ear and out the
[37:14] other it doesn't work that way it
[37:17] doesn't go through one ear and out the
[37:19] other just the fact that you're low in
[37:21] your guards it becomes normal is a
[37:22] problem in itself but with children and
[37:25] with adults it goes in one ear a little
[37:27] bit filters down on the heart on its way
[37:29] out the other year
[37:30] don't think you can just filter it out
[37:32] like that
[37:35] Ephesians 4 29 says let no corrupt
[37:37] communication proceed out of your mouth
[37:39] but how much communication proceeds out
[37:42] of Hollywood
[37:43] how many corrupt words proceed across
[37:46] the video screen
[37:48] I don't know what you do in your home
[37:49] friends and and some of you may be
[37:51] looking at me like brother Josiah I
[37:53] don't know what you're talking about and
[37:54] that's fine I I I applaud you if you're
[37:56] doing well here
[37:58] but I know that not everyone is and
[38:00] those little four-letter words and it's
[38:02] not just the four letter words but it's
[38:03] the attitude in which people speak
[38:05] corrupt communication
[38:07] only for the use of edifying
[38:09] I'll tell you what a lot of what I hear
[38:11] on the uh on on the movie feeds is not
[38:15] for the use of edifying
[38:17] that it may Minister Grace under the
[38:19] hearers
[38:20] and grieve not the Holy Spirit whereby
[38:22] your seal in the day of redemption and
[38:25] that all bitterness and wrath and anger
[38:27] and clamor and evil speaking
[38:30] be put away from you
[38:32] not just don't do it but be put away
[38:35] from you not bringing into your home but
[38:38] put it away from you make your home
[38:41] sanctified
[38:43] make your home a place that God's
[38:45] presence would be free to dwell
[38:47] Galatians 5 19 says it like this the
[38:49] works of the flesh are manifest which
[38:51] are these adultery and fornication we
[38:53] covered those but also uncleanliness
[38:56] loose living idolatry witchcraft
[39:00] sorcery
[39:02] magic spells things that
[39:06] worship or bring praise honor and glory
[39:09] to the occult
[39:13] I could name a few shows but I don't
[39:15] think I have to
[39:17] I'm not here to give you a list of
[39:19] what's of what's a good show and what's
[39:22] a bad show but what I'd like you to do
[39:25] is take the word today and bring the
[39:27] conversation home
[39:28] and say hey
[39:31] is what we're watching is what we're
[39:33] letting into our home is it is it
[39:35] matching up to God's word is it
[39:39] matching up to
[39:42] fruits of the spirit or could it be
[39:45] defined as adultery and fornication
[39:47] loose living idolatry
[39:49] witchcraft hatred variance emulations
[39:53] Wrath
[39:54] there's a lot of Wrath on movies today
[39:57] strife you know what Ella Strife means
[40:01] it means electioneering and partisanship
[40:04] my doesn't Fox News and CNN just ring of
[40:07] that today see I only I only watch the
[40:09] news brother yeah but if you if you if
[40:12] you watch the news 24 7 if all you watch
[40:14] is Fox
[40:16] there are Republicans that's as close to
[40:17] Christians you can get well
[40:19] I don't think so
[40:21] because I can watch the fruit of that if
[40:23] you if you stay on those talk shows and
[40:25] and listen to Fox all the time
[40:27] what comes out of that is Strife in your
[40:29] life
[40:31] all that lux nearing and all that
[40:32] partisanship
[40:34] it brings out frustration and anger at
[40:37] the system and anger at the other side
[40:39] and where's the love
[40:42] if you can't if you if the first thing
[40:44] that you do when you talk to someone on
[40:46] the other side of the political aisle
[40:47] from you is start talking about how
[40:48] they're wrong and you're right instead
[40:50] of how they need Jesus Christ
[40:52] there's something wrong in your life
[40:55] what Rises up first
[40:59] endings murders and drunkenness reveling
[41:01] and such like I feel like he just
[41:03] described everything that comes out of
[41:04] Hollywood
[41:05] but yet Hollywood comes out and he'll
[41:07] they'll make an entire docu-series of
[41:09] True Crime and people will feed on
[41:12] Dahmer or or or some kind of True Crime
[41:15] series
[41:16] and it's not just that they're educating
[41:18] themselves oh I want to know what
[41:19] happened no there's something in the on
[41:22] the inside that's feeding that you're
[41:24] making it your entertainment
[41:27] that you're making murder and some some
[41:30] some sick man Your Entertainment
[41:33] but the Bible says that when we look
[41:35] unto Jesus Christ who have changed from
[41:38] Glory unto Glory
[41:41] be careful what you're looking at
[41:42] friends
[41:45] be careful what your kids see not just
[41:48] in adult movies but kid movies and
[41:50] what kind of attitudes those kids have
[41:52] not just what they're saying but what
[41:54] kind of attitudes are those cartoons
[41:56] having what kind of ideologies is Disney
[41:59] trying to get across to your children
[42:03] you've got to guard the gates of your
[42:06] home friends apply the token to your
[42:09] home
[42:09] and that's not just the front door
[42:11] that's the video screens that's computer
[42:13] screens that's everything every every
[42:15] telephone that's in your in your home
[42:18] but wine is a mocker
[42:21] and strong drink is Raging whoever is
[42:23] deceived thereby is not wise the Bible
[42:26] says
[42:28] I've talked about
[42:29] a lot of the regular things the internet
[42:32] and the devices
[42:34] but really anything in life
[42:37] can have an influence behind it and
[42:40] that's why we need to have a thinking
[42:41] man's filter that's Washed by the
[42:43] washing of the word of God
[42:46] and that's the only way that you'll not
[42:48] be deceived by these things that's the
[42:51] only way you can be wise is to have the
[42:53] word of God in your heart
[42:55] who's writing you can think of it this
[42:57] way who's who's writing the books that
[42:59] you read not just television programming
[43:01] you might watch or the entertainment
[43:04] that's before your family or what
[43:05] website you go to but who's who's
[43:08] writing the books you read you know I
[43:10] give an example I I had a little book I
[43:12] opened and it was a family book that I I
[43:15] grabbed off the shelf it was you know
[43:16] talking about how to be a better Family
[43:17] Guy I've said well I want to be a better
[43:19] family I want to be a better dad I I'll
[43:22] grab this book real quick from the
[43:23] library I open up the front
[43:25] cover
[43:26] and
[43:28] first introduction says to my wife Susie
[43:32] who no to my former wife Susie
[43:36] as a former wife a poor guy maybe he
[43:39] lost her trying to give him the benefit
[43:40] of Doubt here he's writing a family book
[43:42] maybe he lost her and to my former wife
[43:44] Susie who never stops extending the hand
[43:47] of friendship towards me
[43:50] and you're writing a family book
[43:52] I
[43:53] not that not that a divorcee could have
[43:55] learned his lesson and and write a fine
[43:58] book but he's celebrating his divorce
[44:00] he's saying this is this isn't okay in a
[44:03] normal situation and we're and he she
[44:05] still extends the hand of friendship
[44:07] towards me and he's making it sound like
[44:09] it's normal
[44:10] I'm like well you know
[44:12] God bless him and I hope he's doing okay
[44:14] and that the Lord continues to lead his
[44:16] life but I'm not going to have that life
[44:18] leading me there's better books out
[44:20] there I closed it and I found a
[44:22] different book to read
[44:23] but who's writing the things that we
[44:25] read
[44:26] and where are you getting your advice
[44:28] from
[44:29] not just off the influencers but the
[44:30] blogs that you read and the books that
[44:32] you read brother Branham had this to say
[44:34] about the the marriage advice
[44:37] and what happens within a marriage
[44:39] between a man and woman he said don't
[44:41] pay attention to the nonsense in these
[44:44] sexy books
[44:45] and the things that you read all this
[44:47] stuff about
[44:49] I'm just going to let that sink in for
[44:51] the married folks
[44:52] this is 1964. saying don't pay attention
[44:56] to all the nonsense in the sexy books
[44:59] we've got a lot more nonsense since
[45:01] 1964.
[45:03] and all this stuff and everything like
[45:05] that get that filthy stuff out of your
[45:07] mind and don't try none of these new
[45:10] things
[45:11] and I know what I'm talking about just
[45:13] be a husband a genuine Christian a
[45:16] genuine brother
[45:19] my goodness that that resets you doesn't
[45:22] it reading that almost sounds like
[45:25] culture shock
[45:26] a genuine brother
[45:28] treat my wife like a sister
[45:32] but Solomon said my sister my spouse
[45:37] there's a lot more that I could say
[45:38] there
[45:42] what's the solution
[45:45] solution is found back in our opening
[45:46] scripture be not drunk with wine whereas
[45:49] in excess but be filled with a spirit
[45:52] amen
[45:54] what does it mean to be filled it means
[45:55] to thoroughly furnace it means like when
[45:57] you buy your house ever you ever bought
[46:00] a house and it just feels so empty and
[46:03] and six months later you've got all your
[46:05] furniture in it and you're like wow it
[46:06] feels like a home now it feels like
[46:08] something I can rest and I can relax
[46:10] here
[46:11] that's what it means it means to furnish
[46:13] your heart furnace your heart with the
[46:15] Holy Spirit don't furnish it with all
[46:18] these other things you won't find
[46:19] relaxation or peace there furnish it
[46:22] with the Holy Spirit
[46:24] because remember God made that heart
[46:26] he's the designer of the of his own home
[46:29] he's the very architect in it and when
[46:31] he made the architecture of your heart
[46:33] he made it so that he could live there
[46:36] he didn't make it with anyone else in
[46:38] mind
[46:39] he didn't make it with the devil in mind
[46:41] matter of fact he made it such that the
[46:43] devil would never be fully comfortable
[46:45] in that art
[46:47] he made it such that would never be
[46:49] peace when the devil resides there
[46:51] he made it such the only time peace
[46:53] could reside in your heart
[46:55] was when you opened up the door and let
[46:57] him in
[46:58] that's what it means to have a god-sized
[47:01] hole in your heart a little Keyhole
[47:03] is God made your heart
[47:05] and when he made it he made it the same
[47:08] way that a man goes and makes his dream
[47:10] heart he says my wife and I you might
[47:12] say we always dreamed of balcony out on
[47:14] the master bedroom and we always dreamed
[47:16] of a child's room over here and we
[47:19] always dreamed of having a living room
[47:21] set up and a kitchen set just like this
[47:23] that's what God did when he made the
[47:25] human heart so I always dreamed of being
[47:29] able to dwell with man
[47:30] and when he made your heart he made it
[47:33] for his Dwelling Place
[47:35] and then you can read the Bible in 4 000
[47:37] years of history is God coming to his
[47:40] Dwelling Place
[47:41] he sets up his Tabernacle and says yes
[47:44] this is a tabernacle made with hands but
[47:46] one day I'm going to dwell on a
[47:48] tabernacle not made with hands and at
[47:51] the day of Pentecost when the Holy
[47:52] Spirit poured out that was God taking
[47:55] occupancy the keys the kingdom as it
[47:58] were being used open the very door of
[48:00] your heart and saying this is now my
[48:02] home I'm going to reside there
[48:05] and he's a jealous God he doesn't want
[48:07] to share it with another he's not taking
[48:09] up a condominium he's not taking up an
[48:12] apartment he wants every room in your
[48:14] heart he doesn't want to share it with
[48:16] any other influence
[48:18] but he promises the fruits the spirit
[48:20] love
[48:21] joy peace patience long-suffering
[48:25] Temperance goodness in your life Faith
[48:28] and meekness
[48:32] so what's the solution then
[48:34] against all these things just be filled
[48:36] with the spirit
[48:37] just love God more
[48:40] well how do I do that Josiah how do I
[48:42] how do I love God
[48:43] well he's made you in such a way that
[48:46] the more that you look at him the more
[48:48] you'll fall in love with him amen you
[48:50] know there's there's two things you
[48:51] can't do too much of you can't read your
[48:53] Bible too much and you can't pray too
[48:54] much
[48:55] the Apostle when he was writing says
[48:57] when we're looking into the face of
[48:58] Christ we're changed maybe you don't
[49:01] know who maybe you don't like what your
[49:03] family is right now maybe you don't like
[49:04] who you are right now
[49:06] but that's okay because he says looking
[49:09] the face of Christ we all are changed
[49:13] from Glory unto Glory
[49:15] and there's one day that we shall see
[49:18] him even as he sees us we shall know
[49:20] them even as he knows us
[49:24] you say well brother Josiah what about
[49:25] that other script you said all things
[49:27] are lawful but not all things are
[49:28] expedient
[49:31] and many people will take that scripture
[49:33] to say well all things are lawful for me
[49:34] so I'm just going to do all things
[49:36] and then the legalist will take that
[49:38] same scripture and say but not all
[49:39] things are expedient so I'm gonna I'm
[49:40] gonna go home today and I'm gonna I'm
[49:42] gonna shoot the television out with a
[49:44] shotgun I'm going to throw everything to
[49:46] the curb and it's just going to be like
[49:47] a nuclear bomb dropped in our house
[49:52] and there goes all the hearts of your
[49:54] family along with it
[49:56] so you might say well it's not expedient
[49:59] so we're just going to cut it right out
[50:00] if it doesn't if it doesn't if it
[50:02] doesn't bless then it must be a curse
[50:04] well now wait a second
[50:06] brother Brandon when he talked about
[50:07] what all things are expedient with it
[50:09] it's interesting whenever he brought up
[50:10] this verse he talked about him going
[50:13] away with it to another country with his
[50:15] wife and and he'd say what kind of a
[50:18] home would it be if my wife would come
[50:20] up to me now you listen here Mr Branham
[50:22] you do this when you get over there and
[50:23] you don't do this and he says well miss
[50:25] listen here Mrs Branham he's like that
[50:28] wouldn't be any kind of a home
[50:30] but love will prevent you from taking
[50:32] that which is lawful and abusing it
[50:36] so don't look at the law you'll become a
[50:38] legalist
[50:39] but look at Christ
[50:41] had this little thing to share he said a
[50:44] woman came up to him as he said do you
[50:46] think it's wrong for a Christian girl to
[50:48] wear a scandal skirt
[50:50] and as I understand that's just a script
[50:52] that's got to split up the side or some
[50:53] rise that shows the underneath garments
[50:55] we basically do the same thing except we
[50:56] don't wear the underneath garments
[50:57] anymore so we still have the Scandal
[50:59] skirt today but he said what in the
[51:02] world does a Christian girl need with a
[51:04] scandal skirt
[51:06] even the name the title should be should
[51:09] be a little bit of an indicator right
[51:11] if she's a Christian she'll be so far
[51:14] away from that thing unto why it'll be
[51:17] just as dead to her her love is for is
[51:20] for Christ not to be a scandaler that's
[51:23] right that's quartz the shorts don't he
[51:25] says
[51:26] that's right if you love the Lord you'll
[51:30] be so far away from that you'll be doing
[51:32] something else besides that
[51:36] so that's where it really comes down to
[51:37] is just simply turn away from the things
[51:40] that are causing you to look away from
[51:42] Christ
[51:43] and look towards Jesus Christ and fill
[51:46] your home up with goodness
[51:48] don't fill your home up with little
[51:50] trinkets bought at Target don't fill
[51:53] your home up with your hobbies in your
[51:55] Workshop don't fill your heart up with
[51:57] all the things on the internet and all
[51:59] the displays that would come across that
[52:01] screen
[52:02] start putting that behind you
[52:04] and say I'm going to fill my I'm gonna
[52:06] we're gonna go home maybe like my wife
[52:08] and I've been doing and we're gonna
[52:10] start talking about what kind of
[52:12] entertainment we watch
[52:13] and wherever we can we're trying to
[52:15] bring before our kids Bible cartoons
[52:17] instead of just random cartoons that
[52:19] YouTube generates from us and we're
[52:22] learning how to control the technology
[52:23] so our kids don't stumble upon things
[52:26] because I want to be a guardian to my
[52:29] parents my kids I want to be that kind
[52:31] of parent that kind of father and
[52:33] looking at my own heart and saying Lord
[52:34] there's still things in my heart but
[52:36] please take it out
[52:39] I want to do I want to be have that love
[52:42] for Christ so much that it just puts
[52:43] everything else behind me
[52:46] so that expediency that yes all things
[52:49] are lawful but it's not expedient it's
[52:50] not expedient like expediency is could
[52:53] be defined by well expedient to what end
[52:56] right
[52:57] Paul is not talking about the kind of
[52:59] expediency that expedient to the end of
[53:01] being a polished good-looking Christian
[53:03] when you show up for church on Sunday or
[53:05] invite the pastor over on Tuesday
[53:08] he's saying what what is the expedient
[53:11] all things are a lot are lawful but not
[53:13] all things are expedient for what for
[53:15] relationship with Jesus Christ
[53:18] you know there are certain things that I
[53:19] could do that that would be totally
[53:21] lawful for me to do there would be
[53:24] nothing wrong in the law in the eyes of
[53:26] law but it doesn't benefit my
[53:28] relationship with my wife
[53:30] I can say well I don't hit her I don't
[53:32] abuse her I don't do this that or the
[53:34] other
[53:35] so everything else then is lawful
[53:38] yeah
[53:39] I could hurt her feelings that's lawful
[53:42] by the eyes of our law in the land I
[53:45] could do a lot of things that wouldn't
[53:46] bring me before the Barrister's Court
[53:49] but not all those things are expedient
[53:53] for our relationship
[53:55] and that's really what it comes down to
[53:57] friends and as it comes down to
[53:58] relationship and even if you're out of
[54:01] relationship with Jesus Christ this
[54:02] morning or you say I don't see Jesus and
[54:05] I I don't know how to I don't know how
[54:07] to have that relationship with Jesus
[54:09] Christ
[54:11] how many has ever had a really how many
[54:13] has ever had a friend or a brother or a
[54:16] mother
[54:17] should be all of you all had a mother
[54:19] come on now
[54:20] come on
[54:23] God taught you how to have relationship
[54:25] and even if those relationships are
[54:27] broke
[54:29] you can still look at those and say what
[54:31] a relationship is not and what a
[54:33] relationship is
[54:36] so you can start having a relationship
[54:37] with Jesus Christ just based on the
[54:40] fundamental laws of nature that God put
[54:42] in you in you
[54:44] start having that talk with God and
[54:45] saying Lord I just want to I just want
[54:48] to know who you are I want to be
[54:49] pleasing to you I want a life that's LED
[54:52] of the spirit I want to welcome you into
[54:54] my heart more than you've ever been
[54:55] before
[54:57] I'm talking I'm talking the youngest
[54:59] person here this morning but I'm also
[55:01] talking to the oldest I want God in my
[55:03] life more than he was yesterday isn't
[55:06] that your desire I want less the world
[55:09] in there more than it was yesterday even
[55:11] though it's pressing in more than it was
[55:13] yesterday I'm gonna press back by the
[55:16] help of God
[55:17] even more so and keep that thing out and
[55:20] let the Holy Spirit have resonance in my
[55:22] heart amen I pray that's your desire
[55:24] this morning as the musicians would come
[55:26] if you would stand with me this morning
[55:40] can I give you another tip for how to
[55:42] engender the love of Christ in your home
[55:46] the same chapter in Ephesians going
[55:49] further down right right after he says
[55:52] to be filled with the spirit he says
[55:54] speaking to yourself in Psalms and hymns
[55:57] and spiritual songs
[56:00] singing and making Mel in your heart
[56:02] that notice you didn't say hey Alexa
[56:06] sing the song for me
[56:07] he said you sing it
[56:09] you said you bring back the sing in your
[56:12] homes friends bring back Thanksgiving in
[56:14] your homes bring back the prayer in your
[56:16] homes
[56:17] bring back the random talking to Jesus
[56:19] throughout the day
[56:21] what is it it's it's relationship it's
[56:24] just saying Lord I know you're present
[56:25] let me talk to you for a while let me
[56:28] let me encourage your presence Let Me
[56:30] Entertain your presence
[56:32] giving thanks always for all things unto
[56:34] God and the father
[56:35] in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ
[56:38] amen
[56:42] let's go before the Lord this morning
[56:46] I wonder if there would be anyone here
[56:47] this morning
[56:50] felt the Lord
[56:52] knock on their hearts door
[56:54] every head bowed and it's just
[56:59] come before the Lord this morning
[57:02] this is a special point in the service
[57:03] for me because
[57:06] I've shared what God gave me on my heart
[57:09] and now it's time for me to just simply
[57:12] bring you immune with the Lord and give
[57:13] you that special moment say Lord
[57:17] while he was talking there were some
[57:19] seeds that fell into my heart into my
[57:21] soil
[57:22] I want to water them this morning
[57:26] perhaps they would play something softly
[57:28] their sister
[57:30] is there any siege that fell this
[57:32] morning that you'd like to water
[57:34] with a little bit of Prayer
[57:37] just bring before the Lord and start
[57:38] talking to him this morning friends
[57:43] and you know the wonderful thing about a
[57:45] relationship is
[57:47] it's not like you're coming before a CEO
[57:49] when you have five minutes in front of
[57:52] the present the company to present your
[57:54] case and get agreement and walk away
[57:56] this is a relationship with Jesus Christ
[57:59] you know some of the best conversations
[58:01] I ever had with my wife took not days or
[58:06] or hours
[58:07] but some of the best most fruitful
[58:09] conversations I've I have had with my
[58:11] wife have taken weeks months
[58:14] some of them we've been married for
[58:16] seven years the conversations are still
[58:17] going on
[58:20] and there hasn't been a conclusion to
[58:23] all those conversations but there's been
[58:25] a lot of fruit along the way
[58:29] I wonder if there's some conversations
[58:31] you feel you need to have with your
[58:33] family when you get home
[58:35] this morning would you raise your hand
[58:37] if that's the case
[58:39] that we need to change some ways
[58:41] I wonder if you would commit to the Lord
[58:43] this morning
[58:48] if you would commit to the Lord this
[58:50] morning by a raising of your hand Lord
[58:52] when I get home
[58:53] I'm going to talk to my wife
[58:56] I'm going to talk to my husband
[58:59] and start the conversation
[59:02] I don't know where to lead but I believe
[59:04] that there's fruit that you want out of
[59:06] this and I want that fruit for our
[59:08] family
[59:09] look over at your your husband sister
[59:11] look over at your wife brother
[59:13] they're raising their hands
[59:16] [Music]
[59:18] I wonder if you would raise your hand
[59:19] before the Lord and say Lord I I want to
[59:21] talk I want to begin that conversation
[59:23] with you Lord
[59:24] I I've I've opened the door of Sodom in
[59:27] my life
[59:28] I didn't apply the token of your blood
[59:30] to my computer screen all my life
[59:33] there's things that slipped through
[59:34] their influences whether from YouTube or
[59:37] from Google searches or from blogs there
[59:39] there's things that I recognize that are
[59:42] not your influence
[59:44] and I Want to Be Free of them Lord but I
[59:47] also don't know how to wash the
[59:48] pervasive effect out of my life would
[59:50] you help me
[59:51] if that's your desire this morning raise
[59:53] your hand the Lord
[59:55] he wants to start that conversation with
[59:57] you he wants to clean your heart he so
[1:00:00] much so that he he ingrained it in his
[1:00:03] word that he wherewith shall a young man
[1:00:05] cleanse his way he saith the scripture
[1:00:07] by taking heed according to your word
[1:00:11] Paul said it this way that the Christ so
[1:00:13] much loved the church that he gave
[1:00:15] himself for the church that they would
[1:00:17] be washed by the washing of your word
[1:00:22] God gave his life for you that you could
[1:00:24] be washed from the sin and smut of this
[1:00:27] world not just that you could have
[1:00:29] eternal life but that you could have
[1:00:30] goodness in this life and be washed from
[1:00:33] the filth of this world
[1:00:35] that's your desire this morning would
[1:00:37] you go before the Lord and have that
[1:00:39] conversation with him now
[1:00:42] dear Lord Jesus we just come before you
[1:00:44] father
[1:00:45] Lord I see a lot of hearts Lord that are
[1:00:47] just being honest before you this
[1:00:48] morning
[1:00:50] Lord there's there is a wine that would
[1:00:54] make mockery today Lord influence of
[1:00:57] this Cosmos all around us
[1:00:59] they make mockery of gender and the
[1:01:01] natural order between the Sexes they
[1:01:04] make mockery of wholeness they make
[1:01:05] mockery of clean living and clean
[1:01:07] speaking they make mockery of everything
[1:01:10] the Christian stands for and then they
[1:01:12] try to stand up and make themselves
[1:01:13] influencers amongst us
[1:01:15] but Lord you're calling us out from
[1:01:17] Egypt Lord you're calling us into the
[1:01:20] promised land of your Holy Ghost where
[1:01:21] there flows milk and honey Lord goodness
[1:01:24] Lord that the influencers know nothing
[1:01:26] about that Hollywood knows nothing about
[1:01:29] Lord that the content creators
[1:01:32] know nothing about Lord You've created a
[1:01:35] content for us Lord in your word that's
[1:01:37] meant to feed our souls Lord the souls
[1:01:40] that you design and I'm so happy this
[1:01:41] morning Lord
[1:01:43] to be preaching to a group of people
[1:01:46] that want that content Lord
[1:01:49] that want that influence in their lives
[1:01:51] father
[1:01:52] would you help them now Lord
[1:01:54] as they begin that conversation or
[1:01:57] perhaps it's a conversation they've been
[1:01:59] encouraged to continue Lord already
[1:02:01] happening in their home I pray that
[1:02:03] there would be some tools in the word
[1:02:05] this morning that would Aid them in that
[1:02:07] conversation Lord
[1:02:09] and Lord because it's your word and your
[1:02:11] spirit this morning

[1:02:17] you would have it to be in their lives
