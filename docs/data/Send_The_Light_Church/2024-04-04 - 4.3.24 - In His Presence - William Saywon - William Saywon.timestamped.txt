[6:10] sending some
[6:13] forms even the time I started the the
[6:19] church there was a
[6:23] brother who the Lord touch his heart
[6:26] because we I started the for church and
[6:31] we were in the
[6:33] classroom I
[6:35] left and I turned it over to another
[6:39] Pastor then the Lord led me to another
[6:43] place and I went there it was around
[6:48] 2010 when I
[6:51] started the church
[6:55] there and the Lord have been a great
[6:58] blessing since we started the
[7:02] ministry and the Lord have been breaking
[7:06] so many
[7:09] Souls uh you know our Prophet told us

[7:21] come from from
[7:23] Asia the seven continents of the world
[7:28] the br will come from on every one of
[7:32] them so we been having a great time
[7:37] there so I pray that you be in prayer
[7:42] with
[7:43] us we been in the classroom worshiping
[7:47] the Lord so
[7:49] happily and our better were able to
[7:52] bless us with a
[7:54] land which are communicated with Sam
[7:58] Johnson
[8:00] and from the time you heard about it he
[8:02] have been a great
[8:04] blessing so from
[8:07] Foundation I've been helping I've been
[8:09] sponsoring the work and we build a
[8:12] church to a roof
[8:14] level
[8:16] and when I came on the side when I just
[8:19] enter us this gun AR course the August
[8:24] 29 was the time I
[8:26] came and when I came the uh behind me
[8:32] our brother uh the place we were
[8:34] worshiping the
[8:36] classroom they started to put pressure
[8:38] on the church for us to leave the
[8:41] classroom because they said we have been
[8:42] in the classroom for so long now so they
[8:46] asked her to leave this
[8:47] classroom so uh we pull the structure up
[8:51] and I communicated that with Pastor
[8:53] Johnson and my precious brother there
[8:56] also brother tro uh he to also preach to
[9:01] my church in
[9:02] Liberia and he went there we had a
[9:05] wonderful time
[9:07] also and we we build a structure is to a
[9:12] roof level but because of the pressure
[9:14] the people asked to leave this classroom
[9:16] so we were able to build another
[9:19] structure in the
[9:21] building understand then we put a Zin
[9:24] over it inside the building itself you
[9:27] understand and so for now the Believers
[9:30] now they left the classroom they are in
[9:32] their own building now they are
[9:34] worshiping and I want to bless God for
[9:37] that I was just sharing with Samuel
[9:39] Johnson that the believer when we moved
[9:41] there there were no chairs for them to
[9:43] sit so I share with Samuel Johnson so I
[9:47] told the Believers that when you come
[9:48] into church you can just bring a chair
[9:50] to from your house so there they been
[9:53] breaking their own chairs from their
[9:55] house uh some of the brothers who don't
[9:57] have seat and I tell them at least you
[10:00] can take a block and know or bricks you
[10:03] can sit on it and you worship God and

[17:37] the Lord sitting upon a throne high and
[17:39] lifted up and his train filled the
[17:40] temple and it stood by it stood the
[17:44] serapid above it stood the syapin and
[17:46] one had six wings with Twain he covered
[17:49] his face and with Twain he covered his
[17:51] feet and with Twain he did fly and one
[17:54] Cried unto another and said holy holy
[17:57] holy is the Lord Lord God of hosts the
[17:59] whole earth is full of his glory and the
[18:03] pulse of the door moved at the voice of
[18:05] him that cried and the house was filled
[18:07] with smoke then said I woe is me for I
[18:11] am undone because I am a man of unclean
[18:15] lips and I dwell in the midst of a
[18:17] people of unclean lips and my eyes seen
[18:20] the king the Lord of hosts then flew one
[18:23] of the seraphin unto me having a live
[18:25] coal in his hand which he had taken with
[18:28] the SS off the Altar and he laid it upon
[18:32] my mouth and said Lo this have touched
[18:34] thy lips nine iniquity is taken away and
[18:38] thy sin is purged also I Heard a Voice
[18:41] of the
[18:42] Lord also I heard the voice of the Lord
[18:45] saying whom shall I send and who will go
[18:48] for us then said I here am I send
[18:52] me amen let us pray let's pray you can
[18:57] bow your head Heavenly
[19:00] Father we thank you tonight for your
[19:05] grace we thank you for your
[19:09] mercy we thank you for your loving
[19:14] kindness we thank you Lord for allowing
[19:17] us to be counted among the
[19:21] living Lord you are
[19:23] great and there is no one like
[19:27] you no one can be compared to
[19:31] you we thank you
[19:33] tonight we have read your
[19:36] word Lord we ask you to come down to
[19:41] speak to our
[19:43] heart SE something to us that will be a
[19:47] blessing that we would lead from here
[19:51] rejoicing we want to
[19:54] pray father God for the pastor and the
[19:58] entire
[20:00] congregation Lord we condemn every
[20:03] spirit in here that don't confess the
[20:06] name of
[20:08] Jesus and we invite your pres to come
[20:11] down and be with
[20:14] us we thank you now as we wait on you in
[20:18] Jesus Christ's name I pray amen God
[20:23] bless you you may have your seat
[20:27] tonight I want to speak on the subject
[20:31] in his
[20:36] presence our Prophet brother
[20:39] brahan do you believe the
[20:44] prophet uh our Prophet brother Braham
[20:47] told us that we are in the presence of
[20:51] God
[20:54] everywhere even at your home you are in
[20:58] God
[21:01] pres even when you go to
[21:03] work at your job site you are in God
[21:09] person when our kids go to school they
[21:13] are in God
[21:16] person why because God is only
[21:21] person he is
[21:26] everywhere so
[21:30] in the presence of
[21:32] God with human
[21:35] being
[21:38] men always recognize themsel to be
[21:47] Sinners When you entered in the presence
[21:51] of
[21:52] God then you can see how little you
[21:57] are
[21:59] in his
[22:01] present and when the present of God
[22:04] comes around
[22:06] you when you need down to pray and the
[22:10] presence of God come down sometime it
[22:14] make you to shed
[22:18] tears when you are in the presence of
[22:21] God when you even come for service and
[22:24] you are
[22:26] worshiping and the presence of God God
[22:28] comes down so much among the
[22:32] Believers and you feel his
[22:35] presence sometime you shed tears while
[22:38] you are
[22:41] worshiping
[22:46] Hallelujah
[22:48] but when you are not in the presence of
[22:52] God sometime you feel good within
[22:57] yourself
[22:59] sometime you share
[23:01] jokes sometime you laugh sometime you
[23:05] talk because we as
[23:09] human when we
[23:11] gaed we
[23:14] talk we share
[23:17] forms but when God pres come
[23:21] down that is complete different story
[23:26] amen because when whenever the presence
[23:30] of God comes down things
[23:40] change let look at
[23:44] Adam when Adam was in the
[23:49] garden worshiping God all the
[23:53] time the Bible say in the evening hour
[23:58] Je Jehovah God who was their
[24:01] pastor always used to come down during
[24:04] the evening hour to have fellowship with
[24:09] them and they
[24:12] always enjoy his
[24:16] pres
[24:19] Hallelujah but when Adam sin against
[24:26] God when he knew that he had done
[24:29] something
[24:32] wrong when he came in the presence of
[24:36] God
[24:38] Adam couldn't stand in God
[24:43] pres when he sinned against God the
[24:47] Bible said when he heard the voice of
[24:50] God walking in the
[24:54] garden because he sined against God
[24:58] he was
[25:00] afraid to go in the presence of
[25:04] God so he have to hide
[25:08] himself why because sin can't stand in
[25:13] God
[25:15] presence So Adam have to hide himself
[25:18] from
[25:20] God and Jehovah
[25:24] God who know all
[25:27] things started asking for
[25:31] Adam Adam where are
[25:37] thou I wonder I said but God pres is
[25:41] everywhere and Jehovah
[25:45] God he sees
[25:49] everywhere but he was asking for
[25:53] Adam Adam where are
[25:57] thou
[25:59] I started to think I said but what God
[26:03] trying to
[26:06] portray
[26:09] because he is great he sees
[26:13] everything he knows all
[26:17] things but he came to
[26:21] church and Adam was not in
[26:27] service so he was asking Adam where are
[26:33] thou God knew where Adam was but he left
[26:38] his god-given
[26:42] position so God was asking but
[26:46] Adam I am expecting you to be here but
[26:51] you are done here so where are
[26:57] thou
[27:01] and Adam was
[27:04] speechless the only thing he could tell
[27:07] God was to give
[27:10] excuse Lord the woman you gave
[27:17] me
[27:20] Hallelujah Adam couldn't stand in the
[27:23] presence of God because of
[27:27] sin
[27:29] every one of us that here even if you do
[27:32] something at home and your pastor is not
[27:37] aware of that but when you come in God
[27:41] pres you will know that something is not
[27:44] right in your
[27:47] life you will know that
[27:49] something your own conscience would
[27:53] judge
[27:54] you that you did
[27:56] something so
[27:58] it is condemning you because when we
[28:02] enter in God
[28:03] pres it is like when you are standing
[28:07] before a
[28:09] miror when you stand before a miror the
[28:13] miror can tell you who you
[28:17] are and this Holy Bible it is our
[28:23] mirror it tell us who we are where we
[28:29] come from and where we are
[28:36] going so when when you stand before the
[28:39] physical mirror and maybe you trying to
[28:42] dress
[28:43] yourself like when I was dressing myself
[28:46] in better house
[28:48] better uh the room that gave me the big
[28:51] miror just there I can just stand
[28:52] anywhere and get dress so I would I the
[28:56] miror told me that my T was not fa
[28:58] because it it it went one
[29:00] side so the mar say your tie is not
[29:03] straightened so I have to straighten my
[29:05] tie while I will seeing myself in the
[29:08] mirror just like the story that brother
[29:10] brah gave about about that little boy
[29:13] who had never seen said before in the
[29:17] mirror who went to visit his
[29:20] grandmother and when he was passing he
[29:23] saw the other little bo
[29:26] passing so when he walked the other
[29:28] child will walk when you stand the child
[29:29] will stand you say but what but what is
[29:31] going on that was the first time to see
[29:34] his own
[29:36] image he couldn't
[29:40] understand so it's the similar
[29:43] way when you open the bible to read then
[29:47] you can see
[29:48] yourself in the
[29:53] Bible the Bible can tell you who you
[29:57] are
[29:59] if you are going to hell the Bible will
[30:01] tell you that you are going to
[30:04] hell if you are going to
[30:07] heaven your pastor not need to tell
[30:11] you you
[30:14] yourself from the word of God you will
[30:16] know that you are going to
[30:19] heaven because the Bible will tell you
[30:23] because you will be reading the word of
[30:25] God and while you are reading you say
[30:28] about all this thing that the Bible
[30:29] talking about I'm doing
[30:31] it I'm not condemned in the
[30:35] world the more I read the word the more
[30:38] I I am happy the more I am
[30:42] rejoicing because as you read the word
[30:45] you are not
[30:48] condemned because when you read the word
[30:50] when you are condemned then you will
[30:52] know that you your life is not
[30:56] right
[30:59] [Music]
[31:01] Hallelujah if I say hallelujah you must
[31:03] say amen
[31:05] hallelujah yes it's good to say Amen in
[31:09] the house of
[31:10] God you know we come here because when
[31:13] we enter in God presence we are God
[31:16] children we not come to moon no one
[31:19] die yes we come in God pres and this is
[31:24] the best time of our
[31:26] lives we has God children When We
[31:30] Gather this is our best time in this
[31:35] world because the people of the
[31:38] world when they go brother Brian said
[31:41] when they go to their sporting
[31:44] event they don't
[31:47] care about who sat are
[31:50] then somebody even take up that
[31:54] shed and they go to the stadium
[31:58] maybe if the football
[32:02] game if the football gam about to start
[32:05] by maybe,
[32:08] 1400 p.m. some of them will start
[32:11] leaving 7
[32:13] a.m. to go to the
[32:16] stadium because some of them want to get
[32:19] good
[32:20] position to see all the sporty
[32:24] even they don't want to miss anything
[32:29] and why the players are playing brother
[32:31] said when they are going on the SP when
[32:34] they are leaving their home to go on the
[32:38] stadium bah said they can go in the
[32:42] spirit of the
[32:45] game they go in the spirit from their
[32:48] home they start rejoicing gling so we
[32:53] ourself when we enter in God
[32:56] pres there is the the place that we need
[32:58] to
[32:59] Rejoice to say Amen to the word of
[33:06] God
[33:10] hallelujah do you love the
[33:12] Lord God bless you sin
[33:16] yes so the word of God is so sweet this
[33:20] word you see so is so
[33:22] sweet I'm telling
[33:24] you that why you see people who turning
[33:28] their back on God they don't know what
[33:31] they are doing to
[33:37] theirself if they if they only knew what
[33:41] is beyond they
[33:43] C this body it is a
[33:47] c that we will go behind one day do you
[33:51] remember the story of the Prophet before
[33:53] you could go in the six
[33:55] Dimension the voice asking do you want
[33:57] to see beyond the
[34:00] curtain beyond the curtain it is this
[34:02] body when you leave this bodyy you see
[34:05] beyond the
[34:08] C right now you and I now we are in this
[34:11] body so we don't even seeing the Angels
[34:15] that's standing around
[34:17] us there are angels in this
[34:19] room that's standing around us observing
[34:22] the
[34:24] service but you and I can see them now
[34:27] because I our eyes we have scales on our
[34:31] eyes until we can see the Angels that's
[34:34] standing around
[34:35] us but the
[34:37] day or child of God when they are
[34:40] leaving the
[34:41] world when they are dropping this
[34:44] body and getting into that other
[34:47] body then they can see the angels that
[34:50] are about to esot them
[34:56] home that why even in this
[34:59] body if a brother hand is caught you
[35:03] will not have one hand in heaven no the
[35:07] only thing that destroyed it is your
[35:11] house this body that we in it is our
[35:14] house that God plac on
[35:16] in it's just a physical
[35:19] house it's
[35:21] nothing why even our Prophet brother
[35:23] have to condemn it say oh I'm I going in
[35:27] that
[35:29] again just a few second the few minutes
[35:32] in just spend in the six Dimension when
[35:35] he were coming down he saw said oh Lord
[35:38] am I going in that
[35:42] thing because the body it don't worth
[35:44] anything it worth 84
[35:47] sin 84 sin
[35:52] nothing but when you don't know Jesus
[35:56] the people of the world who don't don't
[35:57] know Christ they cherish this body so
[36:01] much they cherish
[36:05] it see our old there sitting

[36:32] their body they will be young and
[36:39] beautiful they will be in the presence
[36:41] of the Lord
[36:47] forever because this body a for of
[36:50] problem every day you have to treat it
[36:55] every day you have to go and take bath
[36:58] every day you have to clean
[37:00] it suffering we are suffering this

[37:16] day but it will not happen in
[37:18] heaven when we get on the other side we
[37:22] don't need to take bath again we don't
[37:24] need to go to the store and buy new
[37:26] clothes no
[37:29] we have one internal
[37:31] cloth that Jehovah God will put on
[37:35] us for
[37:39] eternity in his
[37:44] pres in this bage in school when we were
[37:48] in
[37:49] school they told us that scientist said
[37:52] when you reach the age of 40 years you
[37:55] your eyes start to get blind you can see
[37:57] good
[38:01] brother BR said he said the but flat you
[38:04] can't see it again and I started
[38:06] observing it when I when I when I hit
[38:09] the age of 40 years I found out that I
[38:12] couldn't read my Bible to bring it to my
[38:14] eyes that day again yeah I have to carry
[38:17] it down and and do my head to see the W
[38:21] thing
[38:23] yes to tell you that this body is aging
[38:28] our Prophet told us he said when you
[38:30] when you reach the age of 25 years he
[38:33] say you are going toward your
[38:35] grave see you are
[38:38] dying the body is burning in as you move
[38:42] every day now is burning is
[38:45] burning we are going towards your
[38:50] grave but the most important thing if
[38:54] you know Jesus Christ and you have the
[38:57] the Holy Ghost in you you are
[39:01] Sav you are a candidate for
[39:05] heaven that is our Hope on this
[39:09] Earth because you that sitting yet you
[39:13] are not American
[39:16] no we are citizen of
[39:23] Heaven the the world is not our
[39:26] home
[39:29] we are just visitors on this
[39:33] Earth you that sitting here there are
[39:36] many people that you knew today they are
[39:38] no
[39:39] more they gone they in the
[39:46] grave they gone where are they one day
[39:49] you and I will also have to go but the
[39:52] best thing before we leave this earth we
[39:55] need to know Jesus Christ
[39:58] we need to have the Holy
[40:01] Ghost when we have the Holy Ghost and
[40:05] I'm telling you we are bound for
[40:11] eternity then when you when the day you
[40:15] see yourself living this world no need
[40:17] you
[40:18] worried because you are a child of God
[40:22] you are going to a better
[40:24] place only those who living behind will
[40:26] miss you they will share tears but when

[50:19] no matter how you die as long you have
[50:22] the Holy Ghost you are
[50:25] Sav
[50:31] So Adam couldn't stand it Adam have to
[50:34] hide himself from God and say Adam
[50:38] see look at
[50:41] Abraham when God appeared to Abraham in
[50:45] Genesis chapter
[50:48] 17 Abraham that great pat he B in headed
[50:53] because he couldn't stand in the
[50:54] presence of God
[50:59] Abraham the father of
[51:04] Faith why God you see God when you see
[51:07] God changing your name that's something
[51:09] good about that because the first name
[51:11] Wasing Abram that name was not a correct
[51:15] name God look at it because Abraham as
[51:17] long he were bearing that name
[51:19] Abram you know too many fear and go and
[51:23] lie you know God said no they they need
[51:26] Abra can lie so I will change it to
[51:28] Abraham from the time God change it to
[51:30] Abraham never Abraham lie before only
[51:34] abrah lie
[51:37] ABR right Abraham lie but Abraham Never
[51:46] Lie Hallelujah but look at sa look at
[51:49] the difference between
[51:50] sa and
[51:52] Paul from the time he were bearing that
[51:55] name SA he were causing trouble
[51:59] right taking Stone destroying the things
[52:02] of God but from the time God Chang to
[52:05] Paul to
[52:08] GA we never saw Paul killing we saw s
[52:14] killing the Bible said he took the
[52:17] people clothes and he were mind the P
[52:20] cloth they put it at his feet and the
[52:22] Bible say he
[52:25] consented to the killing of
[52:28] Steven he was he agreed for that to kill
[52:31] Steven that was all but when God Chang
[52:35] his name to Paul he become
[52:39] prisoner he was Prisoner to Jesus
[52:43] Christ and he even regretted he said oh
[52:46] I persecute the Church of God at the
[52:48] time were bearing that name
[52:52] saw you know when you come in God pres
[52:55] God can change your
[52:58] lies men of other here if we Happ to
[53:01] look back to see where the Lord took us
[53:04] from we not even want to go back there

[53:40] Buddha that was passing over me as we
[53:42] were walking on the street the rebel
[53:44] were shooting we were just walking going

[1:08:16] the fish were already there he couldn't
[1:08:19] believe so when he thr old net he

[1:08:31] this he Tred pulling the N when you saw
[1:08:34] the features he gave up you ran to him
[1:08:39] and you fell at his feet in his present
[1:08:42] he said depart from me I'm not worth
[1:08:44] it I'm a sinful man that was PED in the
[1:08:49] present of
[1:08:52] Jesus but I'm telling you Jesus told a W
[1:08:55] up don't don't worry I showing you
[1:08:58] something but you will be you be fat of
[1:09:02] men there is just an
[1:09:05] example but I'm calling you to be featur
[1:09:08] of
[1:09:09] men so Jesus giv the key to the kingdom
[1:09:13] the first time you open the door you put
[1:09:16] 3,000 Soul there on the day of
[1:09:22] Pentecost you put you put on understand
[1:09:25] my
[1:09:28] English you understand that okay God
[1:09:32] bless you so much
[1:09:35] yeah so you see that God is so great he
[1:09:38] say so when he
[1:09:41] saw he was when he saw that he was more
[1:09:45] than a man he realized that he was a
[1:09:48] sinful man then he said depart from me
[1:09:51] oh lord for I am a sinful man that was p
[1:09:54] in the presence Son of
[1:09:58] God what happened to Paul on the road of
[1:10:01] damasc act chapter 9 when you when you
[1:10:04] were going the Lord stck him and he fell
[1:10:08] he saw the P of
[1:10:10] fire being of Jews or Hebrew or
[1:10:14] Pharisees he know the P of fire so he
[1:10:17] say who are th Lord and the voice said
[1:10:20] but I am Jesus who you are
[1:10:23] persecuting where did he saw Jesus
[1:10:26] to persecute Jesus you were only
[1:10:28] persecuting the
[1:10:31] Christian so I'm telling
[1:10:34] you I see what I was thinking I said but
[1:10:37] then if Jesus God can tell
[1:10:41] Paul Paul who are that LA and he told
[1:10:44] Paul that you are persecuting
[1:10:47] me it may if somebody does anything to
[1:10:51] us let us live them with our
[1:10:54] God because because they are not hurting
[1:10:56] us they are hurting
[1:11:00] Jesus that what Jesus told Paul say you
[1:11:04] are persecuting
[1:11:09] me but but but because he was
[1:11:14] predestinated he was predestinated SE of
[1:11:18] God so God arrested him and say you will
[1:11:22] be op
[1:11:24] prisoner
[1:11:26] from that time Paul became op
[1:11:30] prison when he was wrting his son Fon he
[1:11:34] said poor a
[1:11:36] prisoner for Jesus Christ not for any
[1:11:39] man no prisoner to be to be in in the in
[1:11:42] the cell for the government
[1:11:45] no for Jesus
[1:11:47] Christ and I'm telling you my my
[1:11:50] brothers and sister when you are praying
[1:11:52] for Jesus during the night hour when
[1:11:55] Jesus wake you up you will wake up and
[1:11:58] pray because you pray enough for him so
[1:12:01] sometime you can be on your bed why you
[1:12:03] laying down and the Lord will open your
[1:12:05] eye and that small still voice will
[1:12:08] speak to you say wake up and
[1:12:13] pray but sometime we just Overlook the
[1:12:15] voice of God and we listen to the flesh
[1:12:19] the fles will tell that you are
[1:12:21] tired you are so weak you can pray now
[1:12:24] so just be lying down on on on a bed and
[1:12:27] just pray but Jesus don't want it that
[1:12:30] way he said rise get on your knee and
[1:12:34] pray maybe why maybe while you are on
[1:12:37] your KNE you are praying then you ask
[1:12:39] you pray for the pastor pray for the
[1:12:42] Deacon pray for that other sister pray
[1:12:45] for that other brother maybe the person

[1:12:56] another time you will be sleeping and
[1:12:58] Jesus will wake the better up and say
[1:13:03] pray that why we have to pray for each
[1:13:08] other sometime when a pastor stand here
[1:13:11] and say oh and the pastor to talk about
[1:13:13] somebody that's sick somebody will need
[1:13:15] to remember and you pray for the person
[1:13:18] in the church when you go home don't

[1:14:32] people and God fortify
[1:14:35] him God protect him and God bless him he
[1:14:40] was so secure I'm telling you sometime
[1:14:44] some people when God start to bless them
[1:14:46] then Pride enter in their
[1:14:49] heart and pride is not good God hit the
[1:14:53] spirit of pride God love for all his
[1:14:56] children to be
[1:14:59] humble so King us here he first so much
[1:15:04] he F that he was King he can do anything
[1:15:07] and that was
[1:15:08] wrong he walk in the temple in start to
[1:15:12] brn

[1:19:03] said God will replace
[1:19:06] you and God will bring somebody who will
[1:19:09] lead his
[1:19:10] song and you will be
[1:19:12] ashamed because nobody can BL
[1:19:17] God even if your pastor stand to say no
[1:19:20] I'm tired Jesus I don't want to preach
[1:19:23] your word again if he move go will bring
[1:19:26] somebody who will do it better than
[1:19:31] him and he left the brother left never I
[1:19:35] never call him God brought a some leer
[1:19:39] that have never seen
[1:19:44] before that the brother can leave the
[1:19:46] song you see the entire church
[1:19:48] jubilating I've never seen the better he
[1:19:51] can list Son Well perfect
[1:19:55] up to now he said that now leing the
[1:19:58] song the brother came he called he said
[1:20:03] I will I will come back to church I said
[1:20:06] what the call me they say oh brother you
[1:20:08] want come back to church I said but
[1:20:10] nobody driving away he went so if you
[1:20:13] willing to come our doors are
[1:20:16] open we driving our he drove out if you
[1:20:20] realize a mistake let him come back to
[1:20:23] church but the brother who leing the son
[1:20:26] now he will remain
[1:20:28] there he can be removed he will be there
[1:20:31] when he come let he sit and worship
[1:20:35] God nobody can BL
[1:20:38] God Only God Can Only God Can BL us but
[1:20:41] we can BL
[1:20:43] him because we are not the one that
[1:20:46] loving God the Bible say it it was God
[1:20:49] that started loving us first before we
[1:20:52] started loving him he started loving us
[1:20:54] he went and starts searching for us
[1:20:56] everyone other year he for us search for
[1:20:59] us and bring us together so we can BL
[1:21:02] him he can BL
[1:21:06] us
[1:21:09] hallelujah so K when he did that he got
[1:21:13] angry god stricking with Leprosy and God
[1:21:17] never he him he remain in that condition
[1:21:19] until he
[1:21:23] die then when he died the prophet
[1:21:27] because Isaiah was looking at him Isaiah
[1:21:30] was watching him Isaiah were Beyond him
[1:21:33] all the
[1:21:34] time as a role mod monitoring him always
[1:21:38] around him that why when it come to the
[1:21:41] message of the hour there's no
[1:21:43] friendship in this
[1:21:46] message brother Mar both of all can be
[1:21:49] friends but as long you holding God I
[1:21:52] need to hold God I don't need to hold
[1:21:55] mountain m need to hold me he don't need
[1:21:58] to hold me I don't need to hold him read
[1:22:01] the Bible Paul said follow me as I
[1:22:05] follow
[1:22:07] Christ he said follow me as I follow
[1:22:10] Christ when I leave Christ leave
[1:22:17] me so let's say this thing is God for
[1:22:21] typical example God is not an object but
[1:22:24] I'm just just show example so if that is
[1:22:27] God and I'm standing here and I'm
[1:22:29] worshiping God I'm holding to
[1:22:32] God a better thr kind and start holding
[1:22:35] me as long I am holding to God he say
[1:22:38] holding God but the day I leave God he
[1:22:41] saying leave God right because he
[1:22:43] holding me he is holding me and I there
[1:22:46] holding God so whole Hope and Faith
