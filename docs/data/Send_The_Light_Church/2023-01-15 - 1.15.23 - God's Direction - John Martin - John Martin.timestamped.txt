[16:22] Jordan thank you guys for coming we love
[16:24] seeing you guys and
[16:26] um they'll actually have a testimony for
[16:28] us they both have testimonies it's like
[16:30] just to invite them up here
[16:40] God bless you all I'm Jordan romberger
[16:42] I'm Kathleen romberger's nephew
[16:46] and we had a
[16:50] a nice ceremony yesterday for her I know
[16:53] she was a
[16:55] soldier in the church here and she
[16:57] inspired me many times just even coming
[16:59] here praying and she spent a lot of time
[17:02] at home also
[17:04] um I have a little story to tell just
[17:06] from when I was probably just about 10
[17:09] years old so maybe 30 some years ago
[17:12] even back then she was just serving the
[17:15] lord faithfully and
[17:17] um even at that young age I remember her
[17:21] calling my sister Kayla and her two kids
[17:24] Steve and Emily up to the porch on my
[17:28] grandparents house up Northern Michigan
[17:29] at the time and she said the Lord just
[17:31] led me to pray with you
[17:33] and she just started praying in the name
[17:35] of the Lord Jesus Christ and
[17:37] up till that point I had no memory of
[17:41] the physical presence of the Lord or the
[17:43] Holy Spirit move in but it was kind of
[17:45] like brother Branham described the
[17:46] Whirlwind
[17:47] but I didn't hear it it just could feel
[17:49] it moving and all of us were just crying
[17:52] and praising the Lord and her
[17:56] um praying while we were feeling this
[17:59] and I know all of us felt it and even at
[18:01] that young age just
[18:03] her obedience to the Lord in the moment
[18:07] has stuck with me for 40 years and 30
[18:10] years and um
[18:12] so I just appreciate that and even I
[18:15] heard on her dying last day she was
[18:17] still asking her son and daughter you
[18:21] know are you saved and she's still just
[18:24] up until her last moments there
[18:28] um
[18:29] and of course we're still praying for
[18:31] that for their salvation and uh
[18:34] full obedience to the word
[18:36] um she has uh a card here on some of her
[18:40] favorite scriptures I just wanted to
[18:42] repeat one of them
[18:44] second Timothy 3 16-17 all scriptures
[18:48] inspired by God and profitable for
[18:51] teaching for reproof for correction for
[18:54] training and righteousness that the man
[18:56] of God may be adequate equipped for
[18:59] every good work
[19:01] I feel like she lived that and she was
[19:04] always reading her Bible and uh inspires
[19:07] me to dig in more because I know it's
[19:10] it's true
[19:13] [Applause]
[19:18] good morning it's really good to be here
[19:20] with you all
[19:21] um yesterday brother John asked if
[19:24] Jordan and I could sing and I was like
[19:26] we do praise the Lord but I'm I'm not
[19:29] sure that's our gift to the body
[19:32] um and then he said well what about a
[19:33] testimony and I I am into that there's
[19:36] always a reason to give a testimony
[19:38] so um I just thought you know we come
[19:41] maybe once or twice a year
[19:43] you don't maybe know there might there
[19:46] actually are new faces that I don't
[19:47] think I've seen you may not know a whole
[19:49] lot about us so I thought I'd just share
[19:51] a little bit of of my background
[19:54] um I grew up in a message church I'm so
[19:57] thankful for that my dad was the pastor
[19:59] there for uh over 40 years so I feel
[20:04] just so incredibly privileged to
[20:07] have had that start in the word but I
[20:10] would say I was probably junior senior
[20:13] year in high school when I really
[20:16] started feeling that thirst and hunger
[20:18] for the word and was so blessed to have
[20:21] some some uh a younger couple in the
[20:24] church that just took me in a good
[20:26] friend we met just week after week
[20:29] delving into the word and it just really
[20:31] ignited the fire in me and
[20:35] um again just feel so thankful and
[20:38] blessed that I never felt the pull of
[20:40] the world uh calling me away not that I
[20:42] haven't you know had a lot to overcome
[20:45] but you know my encouragement is to the
[20:48] young children is just just stay with it
[20:51] God will bless you he will bless your
[20:53] life and you know he can redeem anything
[20:56] I believe that I've seen it
[20:59] but if you can stay with the word you'll
[21:01] be blessed
[21:03] so we're still at my home church that I
[21:06] grew up in in Troy Ohio I'm very blessed
[21:10] and thankful that Jordan came my way
[21:12] and decided to stay I love being close
[21:15] to my family
[21:17] my church obviously is my family
[21:21] so we have a 15 year old son 13 year old
[21:25] daughter and an eight-year-old son they
[21:28] are all dispersed the two older ones are
[21:30] on a youth retreat with our church and
[21:33] Tate decided to go to church with his
[21:35] cousins Hannah and Huey this morning
[21:38] we also had our daughter Willow so I'm I
[21:42] know Kathleen had you you pray for us
[21:44] she died the day that she was born about
[21:46] 11 and a half years ago
[21:48] so I just Rejoice to know that Kathleen
[21:51] is there with her
[21:52] being able to tell her about her family
[21:56] and I I just feel like it really seems
[22:00] like God is calling some people home so
[22:02] that we have we have something more to
[22:05] look forward to maybe they're up there
[22:07] calling out to Jesus to come quickly for
[22:10] all of us and reunite us
[22:12] and I just wanted to share too just a
[22:14] little bit about what God's been doing
[22:16] in my life the last couple years I feel
[22:18] like
[22:19] I am just so blessed to see healing take
[22:24] place in my life not
[22:26] physically yes I've I've battled with
[22:29] asthma kind of my whole life and I've
[22:30] seen him
[22:32] deal with that and other things but
[22:34] really just on an emotional and a
[22:37] spiritual level he is healing my heart
[22:40] he has really given me the opportunity
[22:43] to learn how to live in the moment so
[22:47] not thinking about the past that's all
[22:49] under the blood good bad shame sorrow
[22:54] not worrying about the future because we
[22:56] don't know what it brings but to just be
[22:58] right here in this moment
[23:01] and just to have an openness to whatever
[23:04] it is believing that as I take a step
[23:07] forward he's going to be leading me I
[23:09] don't need to think about I don't need
[23:11] to think about the next words that come
[23:13] out of my mouth he's going to lead me
[23:15] and I just feel you know to see
[23:19] you know now now in thinking about
[23:21] Kathleen and her life and
[23:24] you know it's we just don't know what
[23:27] tomorrow is going to bring so I want to
[23:29] be where he is and that's right now and
[23:33] um he's just revealing that to me more
[23:36] and more that it's okay to pause it's
[23:37] okay to be silent it's okay to
[23:40] not worry to set that all down and so
[23:44] I'm here today and I'm grateful
[23:48] [Applause]
[23:55] thank you so much for those testimony I
[23:57] just love it uh you got to be present in
[24:00] the moment spiritual awareness is this
[24:02] the key God's always trying to move or
[24:04] move in our lives and we got to be able
[24:06] to recognize what he's doing at that
[24:07] present moment I love that spoke volumes
[24:11] um let's sing uh this is getting to

[34:57] amen and we'll have a a word of prayer
[35:02] amen Exodus chapter 14 starting with one
[35:06] verse 15 and the Lord said unto Moses

[35:13] the children of Israel that they go
[35:15] forward

[35:35] come and open it up for this moment
[35:39] for this hour for the present for you

[35:45] not
[35:47] a god of the future when you want to
[35:50] make yourself known you always want to
[35:52] be made
[35:54] known as the I am God the very present
[35:57] God lord you know the needs to be among
[35:59] us you know the needs of them that are

[36:33] father we commit ourself and ask your
[36:36] blessings now the remainder of the
[36:37] service in Jesus Christ name we pray
[36:39] amen amen God bless you may be seated
[36:44] uh this morning
[36:46] um we received
[36:49] uh a text from a brother in Ohio
[36:52] and he sent a little picture
[36:55] and
[36:58] um
[36:58] I just want to put that on the board and
[37:01] and and this is what he sent me
[37:05] isn't that the cutest thing
[37:10] and it's it was a blessing but he wrote
[37:14] in the text with this
[37:17] Jesus said feed my sheep feed my Lambs
[37:20] feed my sheep
[37:22] go forward
[37:24] amen go forward and I thought well
[37:26] that's our opening text
[37:29] wherefore Christ thou unto me speaking
[37:32] to the children of Israel that they go
[37:34] forward
[37:36] I don't think it was a coincidence that
[37:37] it was sent
[37:39] I think it was the right timing
[37:42] I want to title this message God's
[37:44] Direction
[37:45] God's direction for a subject Faith
[37:48] forward
[37:50] Faith forward if we could just start
[37:53] back at the verse 1 and and it's a
[37:56] familiar story uh the children of Israel
[38:00] had come out of of Egypt and they were
[38:05] on their Journey the beginning of their
[38:07] Journey towards the promised land now
[38:09] remember that they had seen great
[38:12] Miracles already before they started the
[38:15] journey
[38:15] seen the plagues they've seen how God
[38:18] had
[38:19] moved in their behalf there was light in
[38:22] their Camp there wasn't what the other
[38:23] came up when all the others were
[38:26] battling stuff it seemed like God's hand
[38:28] was with the children of Israel so it
[38:32] wasn't like they didn't know God at all
[38:34] and the god that had revealed himself to
[38:37] them was a a God that was capable he was
[38:41] a capable God
[38:43] and so here let's just pick this up in
[38:46] verse number one the Lord was speaking
[38:48] to Moses saying speaking to the children
[38:50] of Israel that they turn and encamp
[38:52] before uh this place between May doll
[38:56] and the Sea and over against the Bell
[39:03] before it shall before it shall ye in
[39:07] Camp
[39:09] by the sea
[39:12] for pharaoh
[39:14] will say of the children of Israel
[39:17] so I just one other thing I want to say
[39:19] is that
[39:21] God is doing the direction here God is
[39:24] directing them amen and Pharaoh will say
[39:29] of the children of Israel they are in
[39:32] Tangled in the land in other words
[39:34] they're trapped the Wilderness have shut
[39:37] them in
[39:38] and I will harden Pharaoh's heart
[39:42] that he shall follow after them and I
[39:45] will be honored upon pharaoh and upon
[39:48] all his hosts and the Egyptians that the
[39:51] Egyptians may know that I am the Lord
[39:56] and they did so
[39:59] now
[40:00] I never see this
[40:02] to just hear of late
[40:04] but God has other plans God had other
[40:08] plans than just to help the children of
[40:11] Israel get to the promised land okay
[40:15] God had plans
[40:17] to be honored
[40:20] with the enemy of Israel
[40:25] and all as it did was cause more
[40:27] problems for Israel
[40:30] more hurt more suffering more battle
[40:33] more fear to arise
[40:39] but God wanted it and what's so
[40:41] important about this is
[40:43] there's things going on
[40:46] Beyond us when we're going through our
[40:49] trials
[40:52] and God don't have to tell us about them
[40:55] God don't even have to get our okay but
[40:58] it will cause similar things that happen
[41:00] to the children of Israel God wanted
[41:03] their enemy to know who was really in
[41:05] control
[41:06] who holds the final say so who is the
[41:09] creator of the universe and who controls
[41:12] the forces of life
[41:15] children of Israel they just did not
[41:17] like being put in a corner all right
[41:20] with no way out the enemy coming after
[41:23] them and and
[41:26] they were dealing with thoughts that
[41:28] would have been better if we would have
[41:29] just sitting comfortable back in Egypt
[41:34] they didn't like being in that position
[41:36] none of us like being in a position
[41:39] of what am I going to do
[41:42] right now because of this
[41:46] but that's what faith is all about God's
[41:48] direction is always Faith forward amen
[41:52] we must always keep in mind
[41:55] that the things that happen around us
[41:59] aren't always what we expect
[42:02] God's ways are higher than our ways his
[42:05] thoughts are higher than our thoughts
[42:11] he's got things in mind and our
[42:13] confidence is not us figuring out how
[42:15] we're going to take care of our
[42:16] situation
[42:18] our confidence is that God's in control
[42:20] and the quicker we can get to that part
[42:23] get to that part then none of this what
[42:25] we're going through is going to matter
[42:29] when you
[42:31] whenever you
[42:33] got things figured out or you've got to
[42:35] figure things out you got to drop it as
[42:37] quick as possible
[42:39] Proverbs tells us be not wise in thine
[42:42] own eyes
[42:43] but trust in the Lord with all thine
[42:45] heart lean not to thy own understanding
[42:47] in all thy ways acknowledge Him and what
[42:50] he shall direct thy path God was the one
[42:54] that led him in this direction
[42:56] they didn't make a mistake and go the
[42:58] wrong way
[42:59] right they were under the direction of
[43:03] God
[43:06] a lot of times God directs Us in paths
[43:09] that we don't want to go
[43:11] but this is not a walk of understanding
[43:14] it's a walk of faith
[43:16] it's not by sight it's not by reasonings
[43:19] not by our ability to figure things out
[43:23] if there's no faith involved don't
[43:25] expect God to be involved
[43:30] we can only please God by faith
[43:33] without it it's impossible
[43:36] I know we we have to use our mind in
[43:39] figuring things out down here we got a
[43:40] flat tire let's fix the tire
[43:43] we're out we we need a route of milk we
[43:45] go to the store we buy milk I mean we
[43:47] have a mind to figure things out to help
[43:50] us in this life but when it comes to God
[43:52] there's no figuring there's a trust
[43:54] there's a confidence that who that God
[43:57] is in control of our of our very being
[43:59] we are the Sheep of this pastor and he
[44:02] is leading the way he is the great
[44:04] Shepherd
[44:05] every man
[44:09] even the
[44:12] even the Bible says Thou preparest a
[44:14] table before me in the presence of my
[44:16] enemies
[44:17] thou Anonymous my head with oil my cup
[44:20] runneth over
[44:23] even though we don't want anything to do
[44:25] with Egypt or our enemy
[44:29] God
[44:31] does
[44:35] he makes it that here who's our greatest
[44:38] enemy ourselves right okay so he's
[44:41] prepared a table
[44:43] right for for our inner man right in the
[44:47] presence of this carnal nature that
[44:50] wants to bring us down
[44:56] and even though God is leading us to a
[44:59] promised land and we got so many
[45:01] hindrances
[45:03] God is going to use all things to work
[45:06] out
[45:07] the Bible says that he makes all things
[45:10] to work out according to his will amen
[45:15] amen and if he wants honor through our
[45:17] difficulties or situations or or even
[45:20] our enemy that we don't want to have
[45:22] anything to do with but God still wants
[45:25] honor then he deserves the honor that he
[45:28] wants it's not up to us to say we got to
[45:31] get away from this thing right
[45:34] God will take care of it amen
[45:37] we just got to walk forward yes sir yes
[45:38] sir keep marching forward
[45:42] God wants your enemy to see that God is
[45:46] in control of what blessing you
[45:50] if God God wants to bless you but he
[45:54] wants the enemy to see that
[45:58] and he wants to bring honor somehow
[46:01] through the difficulty
[46:03] and he knows exactly how to do it so we
[46:06] just again just trust him don't try to
[46:08] figure it out amen all right verse five
[46:10] and it was told
[46:12] the king of Egypt the people fled and
[46:16] the Heart of pharaoh and his servants
[46:19] turned against the people
[46:21] and they said why have we done this
[46:25] that we have let
[46:27] Israel go from serving us
[46:31] and he made ready his Chariot and took
[46:33] his people with him and he took 600
[46:36] chosen chariots and all the Chariots of
[46:38] Egypt and captains over every one of
[46:40] them
[46:41] and the Lord hardened the heart of
[46:44] pharaoh king of Egypt
[46:46] and he pursued after the children of
[46:49] Israel and the children of Israel went
[46:51] out
[46:52] with a high hand now everyone in
[46:57] Israel at that moment
[46:59] they came out of Egypt
[47:01] if they all got together and said let's
[47:03] have a vote in a church okay what's the
[47:05] vote let's vote that the Egyptians do
[47:09] not come after us just to leave us alone
[47:11] and let us go serve God
[47:13] they would all voted that way
[47:17] so God outvoted them
[47:19] but think about this if the Egyptians
[47:22] wouldn't have came there'd be nothing
[47:24] written in history of how God destroyed
[47:26] the mighty Army of Egypt with by the
[47:30] Finger of God with a flood it would have
[47:32] never happened
[47:33] see you see so when we're wanting things
[47:36] to go a certain way God's got something
[47:38] else in mind
[47:41] and that's that's the beauty of trust
[47:44] you don't got to figure it out
[47:46] God knows what he's doing amen
[47:50] amen so when God hardens somebody's
[47:51] heart
[47:54] don't ask why did God do this
[47:58] don't do that
[48:00] it was to bring God honor somehow
[48:03] and sometimes we have to suffer more
[48:05] because God wants to see honor somewhere
[48:09] think about that no nobody wants to
[48:11] suffer but
[48:12] it's important that we're encouraged
[48:15] that God is in control
[48:19] to have a life without suffering
[48:23] you if we don't suffer with him we
[48:25] cannot reign with him if we deny him if
[48:28] we deny a god that is allowing suffering
[48:31] the Bible says he will deny us
[48:34] it's part of it but our encouragement
[48:37] comes that God is with us and he's
[48:40] building character
[48:43] Romans chapter 9 verse 7 says for the
[48:47] scripture saith unto Pharaoh even for
[48:49] the same purpose have I raised thee up
[48:51] that I might show my power in thee and
[48:54] that my name might be declared
[48:56] throughout the earth that is what God
[48:58] wanted but what did the children of
[49:00] Israel want I just bought these chains
[49:02] off of me I want to get out of here I
[49:04] want to be free from that
[49:06] God was wanting more
[49:08] God wants more than what's going on in
[49:10] our lives
[49:13] and he deserves it because he's God
[49:15] we we are his creation we're not equals
[49:23] if we can create anything it's because
[49:25] he spoke into us to create it because we
[49:28] can't do anything on our own
[49:30] he makes us join heirs
[49:33] amen
[49:35] verse 9 but the Egyptians pursued after
[49:39] them and all the horses and Chariots of
[49:40] pharaoh
[49:41] and his Horsemen his army and they
[49:44] overtook them and camped in camping by
[49:46] the Sea behind this place before this
[49:49] place
[49:51] see these places I don't know how to
[49:53] pronounce these places so that these are
[49:55] these places are you with me
[49:57] all right
[49:59] and when Pharaoh Drew Nye onto those
[50:01] places the children of Israel lifted up
[50:04] their eyes and behold the Egyptians
[50:06] marched after them and they were so
[50:09] afraid and the children of Israel Cried
[50:11] Out unto the Lord
[50:14] I honestly think this would have been
[50:17] anybody's natural reaction
[50:19] I mean look what's happening just
[50:22] nobody wants to be in this kind of
[50:24] predicament
[50:28] but now let me ask you a question does
[50:30] God
[50:31] want you to do that
[50:34] when you when we run into a situation
[50:36] that we don't feel comfortable and out
[50:37] of control and something's happening and
[50:39] we're going to get hurt does God
[50:42] want us
[50:44] to be afraid
[50:47] okay so it is a natural thing to be
[50:49] afraid but yet we know it's not God's
[50:51] will for us to be afraid and they said
[50:53] unto Moses because
[50:56] look this is what happens if we stay in
[50:59] the flesh because there were no graves
[51:01] in Egypt has thou taken us away to die
[51:04] in the wilderness wherefore has thou
[51:07] dealt with us to carry us forth out of
[51:10] Egypt
[51:11] it's not this the word that we did tell
[51:14] thee in Egypt saying let us alone that
[51:16] we may serve the Egyptians
[51:19] could have been better for us to serve
[51:21] the Egyptians than that we should die in
[51:23] the wilderness
[51:25] and Moses said unto the people
[51:28] fear not because it was fear that was
[51:30] speaking to them
[51:32] It Was Fear
[51:34] God has not given us a spirit of fear
[51:37] but Power love and a sound mind be fear
[51:40] ye not stand still and see the salvation
[51:43] of the Lord
[51:47] which he will show you this day for the
[51:50] Egyptians who you have seen today ye
[51:52] shall see again
[51:54] no more forever
[51:56] now this is kind of ironic here because
[51:59] he's saying stand still and two verses
[52:02] later he's saying go forward but the
[52:04] stand still is standing still in your
[52:07] heart
[52:08] Isaiah chapter 30 verse 15 says in
[52:11] quietness and confidence shall be your
[52:13] strength you stand still in your heart
[52:16] of of Faith you do not fear you do not
[52:20] worry you're you do not allow the enemy
[52:22] to get you out of your confidence with
[52:26] God
[52:27] that's right
[52:29] the Lord shall fight for you in verse 14
[52:32] and ye shall hold your peace
[52:36] and the Lord said unto Moses wherefore
[52:39] Christ thou unto me speak unto the
[52:42] children of Israel that they go forward
[52:45] Oh What a Mighty word god orchestrates a
[52:50] difficulty almost unbearable no humanly
[52:53] way to fix this situation and he says go
[52:56] forward
[52:58] that's what our God does who saved us
[53:01] the god that we serve today he is the
[53:05] same yesterday today and forever he is
[53:07] still orchestrating things in our life
[53:09] that we don't like we don't feel
[53:11] comfortable it has nothing to do with
[53:13] our plans it doesn't seem like it's
[53:15] going to help us with any situation but
[53:17] it has to do with God and what he's
[53:19] trying to get accomplished in his realm
[53:22] America
[53:24] and who are we to say to God it had been
[53:28] better if this brother or this sister
[53:30] didn't say that to me
[53:33] it had been better you know if if this
[53:36] trial wouldn't have happened to me
[53:39] who are we to say that
[53:42] it'd be best for us to say Lord I'm
[53:47] Gonna Stand still and watch you save me
[53:50] out of this situation
[53:52] I'm going to stand still and see the
[53:54] hand of God he is the I am the present
[53:57] help in a time of trouble
[54:00] it gives a chance for God to get Glory
[54:04] through your attitude
[54:07] through your confidence to your
[54:09] steadfastness to your faith
[54:12] because without it
[54:14] you know God's still going to move
[54:15] forward
[54:18] you know if I don't praise him he'll get
[54:20] some rocks to do it
[54:24] if I don't stand in the midst of my
[54:26] trial and praise God he's going to get
[54:27] somebody else to do it
[54:32] there's no turning back with God
[54:36] forward he said go forward
[54:39] he's always moving forward
[54:42] and he has an expected end for each one
[54:45] of us
[54:47] and that expected end is forward
[54:51] it's always forward it's not sideways
[54:53] it's not take a back seat it's not you
[54:56] know let's withdraw and think this thing
[54:59] through it ain't nothing like that has
[55:01] nothing to do with our understanding
[55:03] it's always forward
[55:05] always forward
[55:09] we don't know
[55:12] what's in front
[55:14] we don't know what's behind our obstacle
[55:17] the obstacle is there
[55:23] yes God wanted honor
[55:27] but he also wanted
[55:29] his children to believe in him
[55:31] and they were
[55:33] at a place that they allowed fear to
[55:36] Encompass their life right
[55:40] the Bible tells us in First Peter
[55:42] chapter 4 we've all experienced this
[55:45] verse 12 beloved think it not strange
[55:48] concerning the fiery trials which is to
[55:50] try you
[55:51] as though some strange thing has
[55:54] happened unto you
[55:57] now we have a Promised Land just like
[55:59] the children of Israel did
[56:01] and between this very second in our life
[56:03] as we're here in the church
[56:05] or live streaming this very second
[56:08] between now and that complete promised
[56:13] land for our lives is a our trials
[56:18] commitment
[56:20] and we've heard we're either in a trial
[56:24] coming out of a trial
[56:26] or getting ready to go into one
[56:28] so between now and the fullness of the
[56:31] manifestation of Christ in her life
[56:32] there are going to be trials
[56:35] yes we're going to be like him one day
[56:38] we have an expected end with him but
[56:40] between now and then there's going to be
[56:42] a lot of strange things that are
[56:44] happening but God doesn't want us to
[56:46] look at their strange things happening
[56:48] to us
[56:50] he wants us to learn from this set of
[56:52] scriptures
[56:54] to stand still and see the salvation of
[56:56] God he's wanting to get Glory somehow in
[56:59] this situation we don't know he just
[57:01] wants us to trust him that he's going to
[57:03] fight the battle
[57:07] he promised never to leave us never to
[57:10] forsake us
[57:12] he said I'll be with you even in you to
[57:14] the end the Bible says that we could
[57:16] have confidence that we can boldly say
[57:19] that
[57:21] God supplies our need amen the Bible
[57:25] says that be content with such things as
[57:27] you have I will never leave you I'll
[57:28] never forsake you that we may boldly say
[57:30] the Lord is my helper I will not fear
[57:33] what man shall do unto me
[57:37] don't fear
[57:40] but be bold
[57:42] speak
[57:47] be bold
[57:48] the Lord is my helper
[57:52] not you're going to take care of the
[57:53] situation
[57:55] not you're something special you're
[57:57] something smart you're something no
[58:00] but the Lord he's my helper I'm gonna
[58:04] exalt the Lord I'm gonna look to the
[58:07] hills from what's cometh my strength the
[58:10] Lord is my helper keeping that your
[58:13] testimony
[58:15] First Peter chapter 1 verse 4 2 in
[58:18] inheritance and this was ratted last
[58:20] yesterday in the
[58:24] um the memorial for sister Kathleen but
[58:27] I think a different maybe a different
[58:29] version of the Bible but the same uh
[58:33] here in Saint uh King James to an
[58:36] inheritance we have a Promised Land
[58:38] Incorruptible undefiled and that fateth
[58:41] not our way is reserved in heaven for
[58:45] you
[58:47] who are kept by the power of God through
[58:50] faith unto salvation ready to be
[58:53] revealed in the last time so we are kept
[58:55] by the power of God Amen see the the the
[58:58] the children of Israel facing the Red
[59:00] Sea they were kept by the power of God
[59:02] they did not turn around and say all
[59:05] right come on you Egyptians
[59:08] God is with us and I'm going to prove
[59:10] God's with no
[59:15] stand still see
[59:17] stand still and see
[59:20] we're kept by the power of God through
[59:23] faith if you want to activate the power
[59:25] of God you've got to activate faith
[59:28] I mean there was a time in the children
[59:30] of Israel life that God did everything
[59:35] God did all the plagues he brought him
[59:38] out he destroyed the enemy and he got
[59:40] into a place and they said okay now if
[59:42] you're going to go any further if you're
[59:44] going to go on the promise anything
[59:45] you're really going to manifest Christ
[59:46] you are going to have to believe for
[59:48] this promise
[59:52] that's how we're kept
[59:54] amen we're kept by the power of God
[59:57] through faith
[59:59] wherein ye greatly Rejoice though now
[1:00:02] for a season if need be
[1:00:05] you're in heaviness through manifold
[1:00:08] Temptations
[1:00:10] well it was needful
[1:00:12] for the children of Israel to go through
[1:00:14] this at the Red Sea they didn't want it
[1:00:17] but it was needful who did it help I
[1:00:20] believe it helped Joshua and Caleb
[1:00:22] I do I believe those were the two that
[1:00:26] got the good out of what was happening
[1:00:32] that the trial of your faith being much
[1:00:35] more precious than of gold that
[1:00:39] perisheth though it be tried with fire
[1:00:41] might be found unto the praise
[1:00:43] Hallelujah and to what the honor which
[1:00:47] would see you was wanting and the glory
[1:00:50] at the appearing of Jesus Christ now
[1:00:53] I'll say it like this David said that
[1:00:56] one thing he desired of the Lord
[1:00:58] he loved to see the
[1:01:03] the Lord in the house of God
[1:01:06] he loved coming to church
[1:01:08] and seeing God Amen of course you have
[1:01:12] to see it through faith you can't be
[1:01:13] looking at this Tabernacle here this
[1:01:15] outside Veil that is full of problems
[1:01:18] and mistakes because every Veil
[1:01:22] is full problems and mistakes
[1:01:25] but it's the word the word and God uses
[1:01:29] the word through a donkey he uses the
[1:01:32] word uh brother random said that that
[1:01:35] first Bible was written up in the sky in
[1:01:37] the stars the word is everywhere if we
[1:01:41] can see it amen
[1:01:46] so when God is here and he appears to us
[1:01:49] here
[1:01:50] and he re he shows himself to you
[1:01:53] personally God I see you that's the
[1:01:56] moment that we should give God praise
[1:01:58] and glory and honor because that's what
[1:02:01] he's looking for
[1:02:03] too many Christians sit and just want
[1:02:06] want want from God and are unwilling to
[1:02:08] give the praise that he's looking for
[1:02:10] I'm telling you don't let don't be that
[1:02:13] one don't be that one you you look for
[1:02:18] every opportunity to praise God
[1:02:21] whom having not seen you love
[1:02:25] in whom though now you see him not yet
[1:02:28] you believe
[1:02:30] you rejoice with joy unspeakable and
[1:02:34] full of Glory now that is exactly
[1:02:38] what God wanted the children of Israel
[1:02:41] to do to believe even though they don't
[1:02:43] see to Rejoice with joy unspeakable and
[1:02:47] full of Glory to really stand still and
[1:02:50] see the salvation of God that's what God
[1:02:53] was wanting out of them
[1:02:56] look at verse 9 receiving the end of
[1:02:59] your faith
[1:03:00] even the salvation of your souls
[1:03:04] we need to keep our eyes looking forward
[1:03:06] to the end
[1:03:10] to the end see too many people I got
[1:03:12] salvation I already got it
[1:03:16] and then they're always bothered about
[1:03:17] what's going on in their life
[1:03:20] the scripture makes it real plain
[1:03:22] receiving
[1:03:25] the end even I'm sorry receiving the end
[1:03:30] of your faith well what is that even the
[1:03:33] salvation of your souls did not Jesus
[1:03:36] say he that endured to the end the same
[1:03:37] shall be saved so we need to look
[1:03:40] forward look forward look forward and if
[1:03:42] the children of Israel could have sit
[1:03:43] there and say I know they're coming but
[1:03:46] you know what they can't touch us
[1:03:47] because I'm in the palm of his hand amen
[1:03:51] I'm in the palm of his hand I will not
[1:03:53] fear what man can do unto me I'm looking
[1:03:56] forward
[1:03:58] amen
[1:04:02] the children of Israel
[1:04:04] didn't know what was going to happen
[1:04:06] carnally they thought if they went
[1:04:09] forward they were simply going to drown
[1:04:11] in the water
[1:04:13] but spiritually if we're going to walk
[1:04:15] with the Lord we're going to have to
[1:04:17] walk by faith
[1:04:19] is there anything in the Bible where God
[1:04:23] honestly teaches us to try to figure
[1:04:27] things out
[1:04:29] like I gave you enough knowledge I gave
[1:04:33] you enough experiences figure it out on
[1:04:35] your own
[1:04:36] I remember when I was young this is how
[1:04:38] my dad taught me to swim he sent me on
[1:04:42] the dock and he is
[1:04:44] figure it out
[1:04:47] and I had to figure it out quick
[1:04:52] God wants us to grow in faith
[1:04:57] in Trust
[1:04:59] not I know God so much I got him figured
[1:05:02] I don't know what he's going to do
[1:05:03] because you know he said this said that
[1:05:07] don't don't figure him out
[1:05:09] trust him out
[1:05:11] believe him out have confidence until he
[1:05:15] comes through amen
[1:05:16] Proverbs 3 5 we read it again trust in
[1:05:19] the Lord with all thine heart and lean
[1:05:23] not to thy own understanding don't lean
[1:05:25] upon your opinion
[1:05:27] don't lean upon your knowledge don't
[1:05:29] don't lean upon your ability to figure
[1:05:31] things out to reason
[1:05:33] or to to even look at the impossibility
[1:05:36] of your Red Sea experience because we
[1:05:39] all get them
[1:05:42] and we don't get just you know it didn't
[1:05:43] stop what the children of Israel at the
[1:05:45] Red Sea
[1:05:46] they were out in the wilderness and how
[1:05:47] many things did they go through trials
[1:05:49] with
[1:05:50] so you know trials are going to be there
[1:05:52] and we don't want them and I understand
[1:05:55] that I'm okay I can even say Amen let's
[1:05:57] sing about how we don't want them that's
[1:06:00] good but you know what we need to get to
[1:06:02] the place where we just say God not my
[1:06:04] will thy will be done I will trust you
[1:06:06] through my trials
[1:06:08] Amen in all thy ways acknowledge Him and
[1:06:11] He Shall direct thy path
[1:06:15] and how is he going to do that
[1:06:18] he's going to direct our path to speak
[1:06:20] the word amen by faith
[1:06:30] speak the word by faith the word told me
[1:06:34] to stand still and see the salvation of
[1:06:37] God I'm going to speak that word
[1:06:42] I'm not going to try to conjugate some
[1:06:45] uh personal thing in my mind that I
[1:06:49] think God's saying
[1:06:51] how many times we try to do that and it
[1:06:53] messed up
[1:06:54] just speak what's already been spoken
[1:06:57] God will meet you there to take care of
[1:07:00] the rest
[1:07:01] oh I love his word amen
[1:07:03] amen he will direct us to move forward
[1:07:06] from our Bleak situation with confidence
[1:07:11] with courage with assurance
[1:07:16] he's not going to just take away the
[1:07:19] Bleak situation so you don't exercise
[1:07:21] faith
[1:07:23] no The Bleak situation is there for
[1:07:25] multiple reasons to think about that in
[1:07:28] the Bible the the Bible says that God
[1:07:30] worketh all things
[1:07:33] uh
[1:07:34] for his purpose
[1:07:37] and and somehow he's using the Nations
[1:07:39] and the governments and the armies and
[1:07:42] all the terrible things that are going
[1:07:44] on and climate change and you could list
[1:07:48] all the problems in the world and
[1:07:51] somehow our God is so great
[1:07:55] that he makes everything work out for
[1:07:57] his purpose
[1:07:59] so we don't have to sit here and ever
[1:08:01] feel that things are are out of control
[1:08:03] things have just gotten a little bit too
[1:08:06] far that's just the devil uh trying to
[1:08:09] tell you so you become fearful with the
[1:08:11] situation we need to keep our eyes
[1:08:14] looking forward to the end to the end of
[1:08:17] our faith even the salvation of our
[1:08:20] souls
[1:08:21] he will direct us to hold our confidence
[1:08:24] steadfast to the end Hebrews 3 3 14 says
[1:08:30] we are made partakers of Christ if we
[1:08:33] hold our confidence at the beginning of
[1:08:35] our confidence steadfast to the end so
[1:08:37] we we could literally say if we just
[1:08:39] take the word for what it says that I'm
[1:08:41] really not a part taker of Christ until
[1:08:43] the end
[1:08:46] foreign
[1:08:48] because let me just say this Christ is
[1:08:50] the same yesterday forever he's he is
[1:08:53] eternal he was he was from the beginning
[1:08:56] the he was from the Bible says in the
[1:08:59] beginning was the word the word of God
[1:09:01] the Word was God and the Word was made
[1:09:02] flesh
[1:09:04] he is the alpha and Amiga before there
[1:09:06] was anything there was a logus
[1:09:09] and the Bible says for we are made
[1:09:11] partakers of Christ if
[1:09:14] we hold the beginning of our confidence
[1:09:16] steadfast to the end in other words if
[1:09:18] we don't if we just start out with
[1:09:20] Christ and we we go through the we
[1:09:22] repent we get baptized and we serve God
[1:09:26] solid for two years and then for the
[1:09:28] rest of our time we decide that we don't
[1:09:30] want to do it
[1:09:31] we got other things in mind
[1:09:34] in reality the way the tree falls that's
[1:09:37] the way it lies
[1:09:40] so how could we really be a partaker of
[1:09:44] Christ when Christ is eternal and we
[1:09:47] decided only to do it for a season
[1:09:50] come on now I I need you to agree with
[1:09:54] the word
[1:09:55] God wants us to look forward to the end
[1:09:57] to keep our eyes looking forward
[1:10:01] these are just tricks of the enemy to to
[1:10:04] lay back to take it easy
[1:10:07] this once saved all we saved I
[1:10:11] understand we all make mistakes and we
[1:10:14] go down the wrong trail we we mess up
[1:10:18] terrible I understand and I'm okay with
[1:10:20] that because there's not a human being
[1:10:22] that hasn't happened to you
[1:10:25] but I am not for this I I I started
[1:10:29] serving the lord here and I've lived a
[1:10:31] pretty decent light I haven't heard
[1:10:33] anybody and if I don't want to go to
[1:10:34] church and I don't want to read another
[1:10:36] listen to the table and just kind of do
[1:10:38] what I want to do
[1:10:39] and still think
[1:10:42] that that's Christ's
[1:10:48] there's a reason this is here
[1:10:51] we need to hold not just our confidence
[1:10:54] but the beginning of our confidence what
[1:10:57] we had at the beginning you know what we
[1:10:58] all had at the beginning when you first
[1:11:00] gave your heart to God you were on fire
[1:11:03] you were on fire you want to tell the
[1:11:06] world you didn't care if you had wisdom
[1:11:08] or not you wanted to tell the world and
[1:11:11] after you told so many people and you
[1:11:13] started getting all these trials and
[1:11:14] tests and people were persecuting you
[1:11:17] you begin to back off a little bit
[1:11:19] come on we've all experienced it
[1:11:22] but that beginning confidence we got to
[1:11:24] hold it to the end
[1:11:26] he didn't bring us this far to lose us
[1:11:27] amen
[1:11:29] being confident of this very thing
[1:11:33] what very thing that he which had begun
[1:11:38] a good work in us we all can testify he
[1:11:41] started a good work in us all right we
[1:11:43] can all testify let's testify
[1:11:45] of this that he will perform it until
[1:11:49] the day of Jesus Christ let's look
[1:11:52] forward to to to testifying to the and
[1:11:55] having that testimony not just the
[1:11:57] beginning but what he's going to do amen
[1:12:01] Hebrews 3 1 wherefore holy Brethren
[1:12:04] partakers of the Heavenly calling
[1:12:06] consider
[1:12:08] the Apostle and high priest of our
[1:12:10] profession Christ Jesus that word
[1:12:12] consider
[1:12:15] notice
[1:12:18] he wants us to consider
[1:12:21] hmm
[1:12:23] well what that means is to fully OBS to
[1:12:26] observe fully and discover
[1:12:29] to discover
[1:12:31] so he is our high priest
[1:12:35] now he's just not the high priest
[1:12:39] in the holiest of holy in heaven
[1:12:43] but he's the high priest of whatever we
[1:12:45] say
[1:12:47] amen of our profession
[1:12:50] not just with the word
[1:12:53] so we have something to do with this
[1:12:56] situation
[1:12:57] consider
[1:12:59] that what we say is how it's going to be
[1:13:04] and that's why if we don't speak the
[1:13:07] right things if we don't speak a
[1:13:09] positive testimony what can he do
[1:13:13] he can only operate through faith
[1:13:16] are you with me
[1:13:19] great is his faithfulness
[1:13:24] great is his faithfulness
[1:13:27] the Bible says in first Thessalonians 5
[1:13:29] 24 Faithful Is He that calleth you who
[1:13:34] also will do it
[1:13:37] consider how faithful God is he will do
[1:13:40] it Nike wants you to try to do it
[1:13:44] but we know better we're no match for
[1:13:47] the devil he will do it he called us and
[1:13:51] he will do it
[1:13:53] amen the devil is going to tremble at
[1:13:55] your humility
[1:13:56] when you get down on your knees
[1:13:59] and you say God I need you
[1:14:02] I need you Lord
[1:14:04] now the devil's trembling not because
[1:14:06] you're flexing your muscles and saying
[1:14:08] you're something
[1:14:11] but you're getting under God's muscles
[1:14:13] you're getting under the mighty hand of
[1:14:16] God you're humbling yourself under the
[1:14:18] mighty hand of God that he may exalt you
[1:14:20] into season when is his season
[1:14:24] you know
[1:14:26] when we consider the faithfulness of God
[1:14:29] that he's our
[1:14:30] high priest of our profession
[1:14:34] that means whatever we testify about
[1:14:36] God's faithfulness he's going to
[1:14:37] intercede as the high priest
[1:14:41] whatever we testify positive about God
[1:14:44] in our situation
[1:14:45] he will move in our behalf and if we
[1:14:48] testify negatively he's literally keeps
[1:14:51] God from helping us
[1:14:54] I'm not saying God is going to do bad
[1:14:56] things
[1:14:59] he just can't move by doubt and fear
[1:15:03] why cry a style unto me why
[1:15:06] why I don't operate like that
[1:15:12] speak
[1:15:15] and move forward
[1:15:18] he only operates through faith
[1:15:23] the children of Israel walked forward in
[1:15:26] God's Direction by faith not by sight
[1:15:31] God told him to go right into obliques
[1:15:34] direct it orchestrate this Bleak
[1:15:37] situation and told him to move forward
[1:15:38] into this wall move forward
[1:15:42] I'm sorry how do I do it Lord I'm going
[1:15:45] to trust you he will make a way through
[1:15:47] there if he wants me to go through there
[1:15:52] I don't have to figure it out
[1:15:54] he's the god of the supernatural
[1:15:58] so we need to learn to speak positive
[1:16:01] confessions
[1:16:03] in the middle
[1:16:05] of our trials amen
[1:16:08] not when we're feeling good and
[1:16:10] everything seems to be good and that the
[1:16:12] money's there and before we our health
[1:16:15] is there and oh we just we like the
[1:16:17] songs that the they're playing at church
[1:16:19] and we got the sermon we want to listen
[1:16:22] to and you know well I'm just gonna
[1:16:24] praise him no it's when there's nothing
[1:16:27] going your way
[1:16:29] everything seems to be upside down
[1:16:33] that's when you need to speak a positive
[1:16:36] confession
[1:16:38] amen speak faithful testimonies amen
[1:16:42] amen Revelations 12 verse 11 says we
[1:16:46] will overcome the Devil by the blood of
[1:16:48] the Lamb by the word of Our Testimony
[1:16:50] and we will love not our lives unto the
[1:16:54] death
[1:16:56] the word of Our Testimony is much more
[1:16:59] important it's
[1:17:00] it's one thing to say I trust in the
[1:17:03] blood
[1:17:06] and it's another thing to live it by
[1:17:08] giving a positive testimony
[1:17:12] not saying well how many times have we
[1:17:15] battled this
[1:17:17] I know the Lord forgave me for this and
[1:17:19] this and this and this but this I'm
[1:17:22] having a hard time with come on
[1:17:25] how many times I just don't think
[1:17:28] God's happy with me anymore
[1:17:31] what that's not a positive testimony
[1:17:33] what you're doing with that statement is
[1:17:36] limiting the power of God and God does
[1:17:40] not want to be limited amen right
[1:17:45] he's more than able
[1:17:47] to take care of any situation
[1:17:49] [Music]
[1:17:52] I want us to remember that we're not in
[1:17:55] some quick Sprint to get somewhere
[1:18:00] he said I'll never leave you I'll never
[1:18:01] forsake you I'll be with you even in you
[1:18:03] to the end so this is a journey to the
[1:18:07] end
[1:18:09] we're in a long race it requires
[1:18:11] patience
[1:18:13] endurance
[1:18:15] amen fortitude
[1:18:18] he that endures to the end the same
[1:18:20] shall be saved so we're not in some
[1:18:22] Sprint
[1:18:25] get done get it over with and let's go
[1:18:27] on with our life no our life is Jesus
[1:18:29] Christ
[1:18:30] from here on out everything that we
[1:18:33] should do it should be about God God
[1:18:35] should be in the middle of it God should
[1:18:36] be directing it and God is trying to
[1:18:38] accomplish what he wants to in her life
[1:18:42] we're in a long race
[1:18:44] and unfortunately this race requires us
[1:18:48] of keeping our flesh crucified
[1:18:52] to keep it under subjection
[1:18:55] to keep it under Authority that's what
[1:18:58] this race requires
[1:19:01] that's why you need patience
[1:19:03] we're in a long race that requires it
[1:19:06] requires praying without ceasing
[1:19:10] they that wait upon the Lord shall renew
[1:19:13] their strength
[1:19:15] we're in a long race that requires us to
[1:19:18] to pick up our cross
[1:19:21] and to carry it
[1:19:23] as a testimony of our love for God and
[1:19:27] what he did for us at Calvary
[1:19:30] you don't want to pick up your cross
[1:19:32] what you're saying is I don't love
[1:19:35] enough what Christ did for me at Calvary
[1:19:39] and I don't mean to be strong
[1:19:41] but we just got to get rid of our
[1:19:43] personal attitudes I don't have to do
[1:19:44] this and it's okay if I do this and I
[1:19:47] let that go
[1:19:48] we got to pick up our cross
[1:19:51] and every time you pick it up you're
[1:19:53] saying thank you Jesus for Calvary thank
[1:19:56] you for going the cross for me thank you
[1:19:59] for making a way for me
[1:20:04] everybody wants a a gospel that just
[1:20:06] appease to their carnal nature
[1:20:09] they're not thinking about a nature
[1:20:11] change enough
[1:20:14] it's a love affair with Jesus
[1:20:16] that's what it is when you pick up your
[1:20:18] cross you're saying I love you Jesus
[1:20:21] we think it doesn't have anything to do
[1:20:23] with Jesus it has everything to do with
[1:20:26] him
[1:20:27] we're in a race that requires us to lay
[1:20:29] down our will
[1:20:32] and live for others
[1:20:35] that's God's will
[1:20:39] he's the captain of our salvation
[1:20:41] that's the race we're in
[1:20:45] it wasn't okay we got it through the Red
[1:20:47] Sea let's Rejoice now and it's all over
[1:20:49] with
[1:20:50] God is not going to orchestrate any of
[1:20:52] our lives that it's going to be easy for
[1:20:54] us till we get out of here
[1:20:56] but what he's looking for is some strong
[1:20:59] soldiers
[1:21:02] that is willing they make a decision in
[1:21:05] their heart though he slamming yet well
[1:21:08] I trust him I'm going all the way with
[1:21:10] you Jesus
[1:21:12] it's not a Sprint of repent be baptized
[1:21:17] we've entered a race
[1:21:20] to the end
[1:21:21] of our life
[1:21:23] amen we've entered a race to the end
[1:21:27] of our life had his sister come up to me
[1:21:30] and
[1:21:31] we were just talking about how sister
[1:21:33] Kathleen held her faith to the end
[1:21:37] and she just made mention about
[1:21:42] we really thought God was going to move
[1:21:44] and and do something for our sister and
[1:21:47] and as he has so many times
[1:21:49] I want to testify of that
[1:21:51] [Music]
[1:21:53] but
[1:21:54] he didn't and and she said it just
[1:21:57] sought the Lord
[1:21:59] and the Lord just showed her she ran her
[1:22:03] race
[1:22:05] she ran her race
[1:22:08] now we're all in a race
[1:22:10] that race is over when God calls you
[1:22:14] so I say it like this this is the only
[1:22:17] time that you're going to have
[1:22:19] to be your best for Jesus amen
[1:22:22] Amen to three more agency you you need
[1:22:25] to give your all to the Lord amen
[1:22:28] we're in a race that requires us to keep
[1:22:30] Pace to keep up to keep faithful to keep
[1:22:33] our confident to not allow the devil to
[1:22:35] come into her mind and give us reasons
[1:22:37] why we don't have to try
[1:22:41] kerbet buffin started writing hymns when
[1:22:44] he was only 18 years old
[1:22:47] he said many there are who starred in
[1:22:50] the race
[1:22:52] but with the light they refused to keep
[1:22:54] Pace
[1:22:55] others accept it because it is new but
[1:22:57] not very many expect to go through
[1:23:01] I'm going through yes I'm going through
[1:23:03] I'll pay the price whatever others do
[1:23:05] I'll take the way with the Lord's
[1:23:07] despised View
[1:23:09] he said I'd rather walk with Jesus alone
[1:23:12] and have for a pillow like Jacob a stone
[1:23:15] living each moment with his face in view
[1:23:21] then shrink
[1:23:23] from my pathway
[1:23:26] and fail
[1:23:27] to go through
[1:23:29] now here it is
[1:23:32] on every mind of the children of Israel
[1:23:37] I'll say except Joshua and Caleb
[1:23:40] they wanted to shrink
[1:23:43] from their pathway that God was
[1:23:46] directing
[1:23:47] and said didn't we tell you when we were
[1:23:49] back in Egypt if you were going to make
[1:23:50] his goal
[1:23:52] we'd rather stay here and serve so we
[1:23:54] don't have to go through
[1:23:56] you know trials in our life
[1:24:00] I don't want to shrink from my pathway
[1:24:02] when he's directing me to go forward
[1:24:06] there's no time
[1:24:08] to shrink and go back with God he's
[1:24:12] always pointing us to go forward to
[1:24:15] speak and go forward move forward the
[1:24:18] Bible says follow them who through
[1:24:21] patience inherit the promises of God
[1:24:25] follow them
[1:24:28] Hebrews 10 verse 35 cast not away
[1:24:31] therefore your confidence don't cast it
[1:24:34] away how do you cast it away you start
[1:24:37] looking at all the problems
[1:24:40] because your confidence is what has
[1:24:42] great recompense of reward think about
[1:24:44] that
[1:24:46] your confidence
[1:24:47] that's what's going to get you to your
[1:24:49] reward
[1:24:50] for you have needed patience
[1:24:54] that after you've done the will of God
[1:24:55] you might receive the promise for yet a
[1:24:58] little while and he that shall come will
[1:25:01] come and will not Terry now the judge
[1:25:03] shall live by faith it's just all there
[1:25:06] is to it
[1:25:08] but if any man decide not
[1:25:10] to keep going forward
[1:25:13] God said my soul
[1:25:15] shall have no pleasure in him now this
[1:25:18] is a serious thing we can think this is
[1:25:21] not a big thing the sermon is going to
[1:25:23] be over in a little bit and I can go on
[1:25:24] with life but I'm telling you this is a
[1:25:27] serious thing amen
[1:25:29] your soul belongs to God it does not
[1:25:32] belong to you you do not make decisions
[1:25:34] of what you want to do
[1:25:37] right it's God's will or we're in
[1:25:40] trouble
[1:25:42] it's God's will or we're in trouble he
[1:25:45] says the Bible says but we are not of
[1:25:47] them who draw back unto Perdition but of
[1:25:52] them were of the group that believe to
[1:25:55] the saving of the Soul
[1:25:57] we've got to keep moving forward in
[1:25:59] faith and in confidence to move with
[1:26:02] Assurance I'll say Blessed assurance
[1:26:05] a lot of times we get hooked up and I
[1:26:07] need somebody to encourage me and I want
[1:26:08] somebody to say this to me and I need
[1:26:10] somebody to spend time with me I mean we
[1:26:13] need to learn
[1:26:14] to get along with God and to know where
[1:26:17] our true help comes and I do believe in
[1:26:19] encouragement I do I need it as much as
[1:26:23] anybody
[1:26:25] and I long for it as much as anybody
[1:26:29] but to live off of it
[1:26:32] where is my relationship with God
[1:26:38] forward onto battle not questioning not
[1:26:42] doubting not wondering not thinking
[1:26:44] things are strange
[1:26:46] he has Us in the palm of his hands he's
[1:26:49] going to do something he's going to you
[1:26:52] know what this is the truth when you can
[1:26:55] get to the place where you do not care
[1:26:57] why he does what he does in your life
[1:27:01] you're just happy that he's with you
[1:27:05] and you praise him no matter what
[1:27:10] you know a lot of times as parents you
[1:27:12] get to that place with your children or
[1:27:14] an employer with his employees that you
[1:27:16] have to spend some time talking about
[1:27:18] why we're going to do what we're going
[1:27:20] to do
[1:27:23] and
[1:27:25] that's okay some of the time
[1:27:29] but there comes a time where a parent
[1:27:31] says this is what you got to do and you
[1:27:32] got to do it now and the child can't be
[1:27:34] going you know what why
[1:27:38] explain it first
[1:27:40] but by then the car may come by
[1:27:46] every parent wants their child to just
[1:27:48] trust what they're saying
[1:27:50] amen just trust them believe it
[1:27:55] God wants us the same way to not lean to
[1:27:58] our understanding but trust him
[1:28:01] trust him so keep moving forward in
[1:28:04] faith Onward Christian Soldiers marching
[1:28:06] as to war with the cross of Jesus going
[1:28:08] on before
[1:28:10] Christ the royal master leading against
[1:28:12] the full full word into battle
[1:28:15] see his Banner's goal
[1:28:18] God did not want Israel to fight against
[1:28:21] those that were coming after him their
[1:28:23] own enemy that we're chasing him
[1:28:25] but God wanted them to move forward in
[1:28:28] battle
[1:28:30] but what was the battle
[1:28:33] of faith
[1:28:35] it was a battle of faith
[1:28:38] of trusting God of of a speaking
[1:28:42] God is with me
[1:28:46] I'm in the will of God doing his will I
[1:28:49] I have
[1:28:50] repented I've left Egypt I'm marching
[1:28:53] forward
[1:28:55] I'm going to stand still and see God
[1:28:58] fight these battles see so he wants us
[1:29:01] to move forward in battle but it isn't
[1:29:03] against
[1:29:05] any person any situation
[1:29:08] it's a it's a battle of faith
[1:29:13] because Satan's trying to get us to
[1:29:15] question to doubt to wonder what's going
[1:29:18] on
[1:29:19] and what we have to do is increase our
[1:29:21] faith
[1:29:23] I mean if we're going to make a Rapture
[1:29:24] it's going to require not just a little
[1:29:27] bitty faith that well I know when I get
[1:29:29] the church the doors will be open
[1:29:31] because they were for the last umpteen
[1:29:33] Sundays
[1:29:35] we need a rapturing faith
[1:29:38] that means we have to build our faith
[1:29:41] build yourself in the Most Holy Faith
[1:29:43] keep building keep looking for every
[1:29:45] situation that happens in your life as
[1:29:48] an opportunity to build because God is
[1:29:50] not going to hand us
[1:29:52] character right
[1:29:55] right it's not a gift
[1:30:00] God did not tell the children of Israel
[1:30:02] oh yeah just because you came to the Red
[1:30:04] Sea yes you did exactly the right thing
[1:30:07] now there's a Promised Land walk in
[1:30:09] there's no enemies
[1:30:12] there's going to come a time where he's
[1:30:14] going to expect you to have faith to
[1:30:16] believe
[1:30:24] second Timothy chapter 3 verse it's
[1:30:26] awful quiet I think if I was outside
[1:30:28] this company really entering into the
[1:30:30] word today
[1:30:32] the word is real
[1:30:35] God is still giving us direction to
[1:30:38] fight the good fight of Faith he's still
[1:30:41] leading Us in that direction to move
[1:30:43] forward
[1:30:44] that's the only way we can
[1:30:47] second Timothy 3 10 but thou has fully
[1:30:50] known my Doctrine my manner of life my
[1:30:53] purpose my faith my long Charity My long
[1:30:55] suffering my charity and my patience
[1:30:58] but then he goes on to say my
[1:31:00] persecutions my afflictions
[1:31:03] which came on to me at Antioch Iconium
[1:31:06] lystra what persecutions I endured not
[1:31:11] that I had to go through I mean you
[1:31:13] can't believe what I had to go through
[1:31:14] no that I endured
[1:31:16] but look at his testimony
[1:31:19] hallelujah look what he spoke a positive
[1:31:22] testimony but out of them all the Lord
[1:31:25] delivered me
[1:31:26] not out of them all I figured it out
[1:31:30] no his testimony was God
[1:31:33] one place Paul said we are troubled on
[1:31:36] every side yet not to stressed we are
[1:31:38] perplexed but not despair persecuted but
[1:31:41] not forsaken cast down but were not
[1:31:44] destroyed
[1:31:46] but out of them all
[1:31:49] the Lord delivered us
[1:31:52] the Lord delivers what a testimony
[1:31:56] you know we've heard so many times if
[1:31:58] you count your blessings it'll surprise
[1:32:00] you what God have done
[1:32:02] I understand we can talk about the
[1:32:05] trials we can talk about the problems
[1:32:07] and they're honestly they're real but
[1:32:11] there comes a time for the believer now
[1:32:13] that he's got to start talking about the
[1:32:16] testimony
[1:32:19] what he's done for others he'll do for
[1:32:22] me now the Bible says they overcame them
[1:32:24] by the word of their testimony
[1:32:28] so we have to start testifying the Lord
[1:32:32] has delivered me the Lord has given me
[1:32:36] Victory the Lord will see me through the
[1:32:39] Lord will give me strength
[1:32:42] I love her sister she wanted to testify
[1:32:45] I think the church should be filled with
[1:32:47] people who want to testify of how great
[1:32:49] God is how great God has been in their
[1:32:52] life
[1:32:53] we shouldn't be sitting hoping that we
[1:32:56] get something that makes us feel like
[1:32:58] that no we should have a relationship
[1:33:00] like that that we can't wait to tell
[1:33:02] somebody what God's done for us
[1:33:05] look at verse 12.
[1:33:07] he didn't leave us out of it this is for
[1:33:09] us
[1:33:10] yeah and all that will live Godly in
[1:33:12] Christ Jesus are going to suffer
[1:33:14] persecution
[1:33:16] and he said evil Manner and seduces are
[1:33:18] going to wax worse and worse and
[1:33:19] deceiving and being deceiving that's
[1:33:21] what you see every time you like
[1:33:23] uh anytime any news or anything that's
[1:33:25] coming out this new information you
[1:33:28] don't know what to trust
[1:33:31] and basically I'll say for the most part
[1:33:33] don't even try to figure it out just
[1:33:36] stop looking at it read the Bible you
[1:33:38] can have confidence with that
[1:33:40] but continue thou in the things which
[1:33:43] thou has learned
[1:33:45] and has been assured of of of knowing of
[1:33:49] whom thou has learned them in other
[1:33:51] words continue to move forward in what
[1:33:55] God has already spoken to you
[1:33:59] God's direction is to move forward
[1:34:03] to continue in the things that you've
[1:34:05] learned
[1:34:06] to hold your confidence steadfast to the
[1:34:09] end to run the race with patience
[1:34:12] the one that he has set before us the
[1:34:15] one that he has directed for our life
[1:34:19] not Lord why did you why has this
[1:34:22] happened to me why do I got to do this
[1:34:24] again why me Lord
[1:34:27] oh don't act like the children of Israel
[1:34:31] that
[1:34:32] had to have it handed to them
[1:34:35] testify like Joshua and Caleb
[1:34:41] is one one
[1:34:43] we just got to be I have a positive
[1:34:45] confession and I know it's hard
[1:34:47] but it's easy to do if you don't stare
[1:34:51] at how bad you are
[1:34:54] all your mistakes
[1:34:56] all your problems
[1:34:58] your situation just none of that
[1:35:01] another
[1:35:03] one thing him
[1:35:07] he is my all in all
[1:35:12] he saved me he redeemed me he is in the
[1:35:16] midst of sanctifying me he is in the
[1:35:18] midst of purifying me he is making me in
[1:35:22] His image and I will testify of my God
[1:35:25] that he is more than able more than Abel
[1:35:29] he has made us a conquerors
[1:35:33] man
[1:35:34] amen he is conquered for us
[1:35:37] no wonder the children of Israel when
[1:35:39] they got on the other side of the Red
[1:35:40] Sea they were rejoicing
[1:35:44] at that moment they realized they did
[1:35:46] not do it was all God
[1:35:48] they were praising God
[1:35:51] but they didn't hold their confidence
[1:35:53] steadfast to the end as soon as they got
[1:35:55] a little further in the wilderness they
[1:35:56] begin to look back and murmur and
[1:35:58] complain and wish they didn't have to go
[1:35:59] through their trials
[1:36:01] wherefore Christ thou unto me speak unto
[1:36:05] the children of Israel that they go
[1:36:06] forward
[1:36:07] go forward the word of Our Testimony is
[1:36:11] so important
[1:36:13] Proverbs 18 21 says death
[1:36:16] in life
[1:36:18] are in the power of the tongue
[1:36:23] you have a choice
[1:36:25] and they that love it shall eat the
[1:36:27] fruit thereof
[1:36:29] like it or not
[1:36:32] we are what we eat
[1:36:35] it's not what
[1:36:37] it's not what comes
[1:36:39] uh inside that defiles a man but what
[1:36:43] comes out
[1:36:44] so you're going to get a lot of thoughts
[1:36:47] it's important that you meditate
[1:36:50] on the word of God
[1:36:52] day and night be planted by the tree of
[1:36:56] righteousness that the thoughts of my my
[1:37:00] heart the the meditation let it be
[1:37:03] acceptable unto thee o God
[1:37:06] it's important to always maintain a
[1:37:09] testimony of Life watch what you say
[1:37:13] amen let your testimony be I know the
[1:37:16] Lord is with me
[1:37:19] why talk about the wall
[1:37:21] talk about God's with me right here
[1:37:28] how many times have we heard brother
[1:37:29] random say something
[1:37:31] along the lines when that Pillar of Fire
[1:37:33] was there
[1:37:35] he was Fearless
[1:37:38] with that pillar fire was there
[1:37:43] and they I believe
[1:37:45] it was spoken that there were some that
[1:37:48] were not they were not afraid of brother
[1:37:51] Branham but they but it was that pillar
[1:37:53] fire because that was the one that
[1:37:55] discerned the thoughts and intents
[1:38:00] our confidence is in him he's with us he
[1:38:03] will make a way for us
[1:38:04] so let us have a testimony of confidence
[1:38:07] now
[1:38:09] of assurance speak positive things
[1:38:13] well brother John you don't understand
[1:38:17] it's okay I don't I'm not leaning
[1:38:20] towards it anyways
[1:38:23] but I'm a Believer in God
[1:38:25] if I have to take sides I'm going to
[1:38:27] take sides that I'm a Believer
[1:38:29] not an understander
[1:38:32] my understanding has gotten me into so
[1:38:34] much trouble being funny
[1:38:37] in the middle of the greatest crisis
[1:38:39] that the children of Israel were going
[1:38:40] through they were murmuring they were
[1:38:42] scared but God was counseling them why
[1:38:46] are you crying to me in this situation
[1:38:49] speak and go forward God's direction for
[1:38:53] us is a direction of faith
[1:38:56] forward not back up not regroup not
[1:39:00] huddle not redo the plans not maybe I
[1:39:04] made a
[1:39:05] go forward
[1:39:09] I mean I yesterday I went to uh
[1:39:14] go get some Stone and I here I am
[1:39:16] running late can you bear with me just a
[1:39:17] little bit
[1:39:20] so there's so many things I want to do I
[1:39:22] wanted to come to the church we got a
[1:39:23] chance to change couple of these lights
[1:39:25] and I want to change a couple more for
[1:39:27] my wife they just take so long to do
[1:39:30] and uh I didn't get to it but
[1:39:33] I had a chance to get some stones for
[1:39:35] her Greenhouse so you know he's got so
[1:39:37] many things to do and
[1:39:39] and so I went to the shop and got a hold
[1:39:43] of the person
[1:39:45] uh are they actually called and um I'm
[1:39:48] grabbing the truck and going to West
[1:39:51] Broomfield to get these stones
[1:39:54] I get all the way there I pull in the
[1:39:56] driveway and I don't have the money to
[1:39:58] buy the stones
[1:40:01] and it's already getting dark and I feel
[1:40:03] so bad that I planned this with the
[1:40:06] other person I didn't mind going through
[1:40:08] what I went through but I just felt bad
[1:40:09] for them
[1:40:11] so uh I didn't know what I was going to
[1:40:14] do if I made a decision called Cheryl
[1:40:16] and she was going to meet me halfway
[1:40:18] it was closer to three quarters away I
[1:40:20] had to do most of the driving
[1:40:25] the way back to meet Cheryl I'm saying
[1:40:27] Lord
[1:40:30] I don't know if I'm out of your will
[1:40:32] but if I am
[1:40:34] I'm sorry
[1:40:37] that's all I can do
[1:40:39] that's all you can do
[1:40:40] we don't always know if something's
[1:40:43] wrong
[1:40:44] we're just Lord I'm sorry and you go
[1:40:47] forward amen
[1:40:49] it gives the CH of the Lord a chance to
[1:40:52] speak to you to deal with you
[1:40:55] because I because that trial when I was
[1:40:57] going through it I just thought trials
[1:40:59] doesn't mean you're out of the will the
[1:41:00] Lord
[1:41:01] in great easy blessings doesn't mean you
[1:41:04] got the favor of God
[1:41:06] man amen we've just we've got to see and
[1:41:11] trust God for every situation
[1:41:15] oh my my
[1:41:18] okay
[1:41:20] I'm just want you to know
[1:41:23] I appreciate your prayers I have to skip
[1:41:26] a lot again that's just me but I want to
[1:41:28] at least get to a couple scriptures oh
[1:41:32] my see this is the best part I don't
[1:41:34] even like skipping the best part
[1:41:38] let your testimony be a testimony of
[1:41:41] faith
[1:41:42] now a lot of times we feel that our
[1:41:44] faith is weak
[1:41:46] how can I have faith for my situation I
[1:41:49] feel weak
[1:41:53] there's things that we have to do to
[1:41:55] exercise faith for a life
[1:41:58] we can't sit and feed on all the things
[1:42:00] of the world
[1:42:01] and expect to have faith
[1:42:07] faith comes from God and you can read in
[1:42:10] it Revelations 10
[1:42:13] uh or I'm sorry Romans chapter 10 verses
[1:42:16] 8.
[1:42:17] uh through 17.
[1:42:19] we don't have time to read it all but I
[1:42:21] would like love for you to read it
[1:42:23] because the word of God is nigh unto
[1:42:25] thee it's in your heart it's in your
[1:42:27] mouth you have to testify of it
[1:42:30] if you're not willing to stand up and
[1:42:33] speak a word of faith I say this to you
[1:42:35] spend some time praying
[1:42:38] spend time reading the Bible
[1:42:41] spend time listening to the tapes
[1:42:43] brother random said that there was
[1:42:45] actually rapturing faith lies in them
[1:42:48] so if we feel our faith is weak I can't
[1:42:51] give you faith
[1:42:53] Faith doesn't come from humans
[1:42:56] Faith doesn't come from that you know
[1:42:58] Daily Bread I've done with the day or
[1:43:00] like your calendar
[1:43:03] or a text or a phone call I mean I love
[1:43:07] them all and God can be in them all
[1:43:10] but you can't stop there
[1:43:13] because we are all going to go through a
[1:43:15] test
[1:43:17] that God is going to demand that we
[1:43:20] stand and watch his salvation or will
[1:43:24] shrink back
[1:43:27] amen so I say spend more time with God
[1:43:31] Amen God will give you Faith to have a
[1:43:35] positive testimony come out of your
[1:43:37] mouth that God is going to see me
[1:43:39] through
[1:43:41] amen Mark chapter 11 verse 22 God wants
[1:43:45] us to speak a word of faith and move
[1:43:47] forward
[1:43:49] and Jesus answering saith unto them have
[1:43:51] faith in God how many times have we
[1:43:54] heard brother Brandon say those words
[1:43:56] when we're listening to a tape
[1:43:58] same words have faith prayer line have
[1:44:02] faith just have faith in God
[1:44:05] verse 23 for verily I say unto you that
[1:44:09] whosoever shall say to this mountain
[1:44:11] whatever it might be be thou removed
[1:44:17] that whosoever shall say to this sea
[1:44:20] this Red Sea be thou removed
[1:44:24] and be thou cast into the sea and shall
[1:44:27] not doubt in his heart
[1:44:32] but shall believe that those things
[1:44:36] which he saith shall come to pass he
[1:44:38] shall have whatsoever he saith
[1:44:42] now I want to say this none of us
[1:44:45] can muster
[1:44:47] that faith
[1:44:49] right
[1:44:50] none of us can sit and say I am going to
[1:44:54] believe for this
[1:44:57] faith comes from God Amen
[1:45:00] I understand you want this or this or
[1:45:03] this or this
[1:45:05] but you have to ask get along with God
[1:45:08] and say God this is what I want but not
[1:45:11] my will thy will be done
[1:45:13] if this is your will for my life
[1:45:17] and you'll know because there'll be such
[1:45:19] a strong strong
[1:45:25] think about all these examples in the
[1:45:27] Bible where the people were blind
[1:45:28] something was going on with them and
[1:45:30] they just wanted Jesus to heal them
[1:45:32] and Jesus would say can if thou believed
[1:45:35] Not all men have faith
[1:45:38] we have to exercise it God is looking
[1:45:40] for him that hungers and thirsts for
[1:45:42] righteousness to dig in and say God I've
[1:45:45] got to hear from you and when that faith
[1:45:47] is in there your testimony
[1:45:50] will speak
[1:45:53] and I believe the the the rottenness of
[1:45:57] ill feelings and and jealousies and and
[1:46:00] bat biting and gossiping and this I
[1:46:03] don't care about uh serving God with all
[1:46:06] my heart and all these things that are
[1:46:08] standing in your way
[1:46:10] he'll give you faith for because it's
[1:46:12] his word
[1:46:14] the problem is the mountains we want
[1:46:16] removed are the things that are standing
[1:46:18] in the way to give us the things that we
[1:46:20] Lust For
[1:46:24] and how do we expect God to give us
[1:46:27] faith for that
[1:46:29] seek ye first the kingdom of God in his
[1:46:31] righteousness and all other things shall
[1:46:33] be added unto you
[1:46:36] I want to end with this John chapter 16
[1:46:38] verse 23 and in that day you shall ask
[1:46:41] me nothing
[1:46:44] very well I say unto you
[1:46:47] whatsoever ye shall ask
[1:46:51] in my father's name he will give it to
[1:46:54] you
[1:46:56] do you believe that scripture
[1:47:02] I wonder are we in that day are we
[1:47:04] looking for it
[1:47:11] ask
[1:47:12] the father
[1:47:14] in my name
[1:47:18] Jesus is getting our direction to the
[1:47:22] Oneness of God
[1:47:24] and the power that we sung about
[1:47:28] is in the name of Jesus Christ
[1:47:31] he promised to give it I want such a
[1:47:34] close relationship with God such a a
[1:47:37] Oneness with God
[1:47:39] that when I speak it's not really me
[1:47:41] speaking
[1:47:43] don't you want that that when you speak
[1:47:45] it's not you it's not your thoughts it's
[1:47:48] his thoughts it
[1:47:51] I would rather be found
[1:47:53] testifying of what the word wants me to
[1:47:56] testify about
[1:47:58] than to be standing at this wall
[1:48:03] and talking about the realness of how
[1:48:05] bad of a person I am and that I can't
[1:48:08] possibly manifest Christ that
[1:48:11] that's not the right testimony the right
[1:48:14] testimony is I will crucify this flesh
[1:48:18] I will overcome I will move forward in
[1:48:22] faith I will hold my confidence I will
[1:48:25] move forward
[1:48:27] in the direction that God wants me to go
[1:48:30] let's Stand Together
[1:48:32] he is the same yesterday today and
[1:48:34] forever
[1:48:36] amen God's direction for us is to move
[1:48:39] forward
[1:48:41] not wait
[1:48:43] move forward
[1:48:45] in faith forward in confidence
[1:48:49] I just love it remember the the the the
[1:48:52] the man that came across
[1:48:54] the prayer line
[1:48:57] and he was blind and
[1:49:00] there had been some before maybe some
[1:49:03] after that brother Brandon had prayed
[1:49:04] for and instantly got healed but this
[1:49:06] man when he went through
[1:49:08] and God said you're healed thus saith
[1:49:11] the Lord
[1:49:12] he thought something was wrong
[1:49:15] so he went through the prayer line again
[1:49:21] and brother Branham said
[1:49:24] God said you were healed
[1:49:34] what did Brother Brandon tell him to do
[1:49:38] move forward
[1:49:40] keep testifying of what God is going to
[1:49:44] do for you what God has done for you
[1:49:47] keep testifying just move forward what
[1:49:50] so what was he doing he was fighting the
[1:49:53] Battle of faith
[1:49:55] so he would testify at the different
[1:49:58] places and you know there were people
[1:50:00] who just went
[1:50:04] yeah right
[1:50:06] but he kept doing with the word told him
[1:50:11] to do the Living Word told him to do
[1:50:14] and God honored what he was doing
[1:50:17] brother van says the right mental Faith
[1:50:19] towards any Divine promise of God will
[1:50:22] bring it to pass

[1:50:27] heard

[1:58:09] beginning of a land that flowed with
[1:58:12] milk and honey
