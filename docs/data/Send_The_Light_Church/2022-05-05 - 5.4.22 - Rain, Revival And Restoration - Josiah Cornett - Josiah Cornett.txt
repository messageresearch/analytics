wherever two or three are gathered he would be with us in our midst and it also says that do not forsake the assembling of yourself so much the more as the end approaches how he believes we're at the end unbelievers we're approaching it well i i want to be right where god wants me at the end amen and in fellowship with the saints i believe that's a good place for us to be tonight amen let's go ahead and go and pray to our lord dear lord jesus we just come before you father lord just so appreciative to be able to come in the congregation of the saints yet again it's your grace that we can

you put us in fellowship with yourself but that you would put us in fellowship with such wonderful company a family of god lord maybe maybe some here tonight wouldn't know what family was like before they came to the family of god but lord you instruct us in right relationships and thank you so much that we could come here and relate one to another through your word lord and through your blood as we now turn ourselves to your word lord we desire to relate to your word father i pray that you'd open it up to each one lord and show us positionally where we are in these last days ran it dear lord jesus in jesus christ's name amen but i won't keep you standing saints we'll go straight to the word tonight i'm so glad to hear that your pastor's coming home we'll be turning over to joel chapter 2 and also song of solomon chapter 2. but uh just so happy to hear that brother john's on his way home to you i know being without him for a while that can be a little bit of a a troubling time for sheep i i know i don't like being without my pastor for long back home i believe the prophet said that after a while you know the sheep they get a little bit they get a little bit nervous without the shepherd and i think that's just the case but i don't think there's any reason for us to be nervous one to another tonight we're all home folk here we know one another i see a couple a couple faces that maybe we don't know each other as well but we're all in the family of god so we're looking forward to our fellowship tonight joel chapter 2 verse 223 the prophet joel here cries forth a familiar scripture he says be glad then ye children of zion and rejoice in the lord your god for he hath given you the former rain moderately and he will cause to come down for you the rain the former rain and the latter rain in the first month and the floor the floor shall be full of wheat and the fat shall overflow with wine and oil and i will restore to you that was the canker worm and the locusts hath eaten and the caterpillar and the palmer worm my great army which i sent among you in songs chapter 2 just to return to our verses that we read on sunday together chapter 2 and verse 10. solomon and the bride exchanged the readings one to another and the bride says of her beloved he says who we know is the type of christ who says my beloved spake and said unto me rise up my love my fair one and come away for lo the winter is past and the rain is over and gone now what happens after the rain is over and gone says the flowers appear on the earth the time of the singing of birds has come and the voice the turtle is heard in early end the fig tree putteth forth her green figs and the vines with the tender grapes give a good smell arise my love my fair one come away may the lord add the blessings to his word as you're seated preaching sunday with you folks here and speaking of these tender grapes and how the bride and the bridegroom are looking forward to enjoy these tender grapes one with another and i i have to step back and and recognize that when we're preaching along these lines there may be some believers that might feel that they're not being partakers of these tender grapes and when we start to look at the word and realize that maybe we're coming up shorter there's still some more of the word that that we're that we're needing to inherit some more of the word that we're looking to possess we we start to think about these rewords like restoration and redemption and revival because we we realize that we want to come back to something something we're called to and that that prefix re means to be brought back to revive since simply means to revitalize to take someone that was once vital and simply make them vital again it doesn't mean that you were always dead and that god just comes along and picks you up it means that one time you were alive in christ but at some time you lost maybe the joy of the lord and it's time to revitalize yourself in christ redemption simply means to be brought back to god amen now many times we think of redemption as the first time we ever come to god but turns out that the bible says that by predestination god knew us already from the foundation of the world amen and so we know that redemption means to simply god brought bought us back by his blood to himself amen you were always his you were always in christ from the foundation in the world he knew you amen and by his foreknowledge he predestinated you the apostle paul says amen so my i i think we can just about get a revival tonight just thinking about god's words but so many times people when they begin to think about a revival they they start looking for something to come that's outside of themselves and they they want god to to have a special dense dispensation of grace perhaps some some kind of extra rain they're looking to fall have fallen down on them and so i wanted to come back and maybe look at this scripture tonight where the prophet joel is promising a rain he says there's going to be a former rain they say amora which that means a teaching rain and there's going to be a ladder rain which is the harvest rain and that's going to come forth at the same time he says amen and so i wanted to just maybe take a little bit of a teaching tonight and uh we'll see if it goes off into treachery a little bit and a little bit of preaching but we'll just see where the lord leads tonight but i wanted to come back and look at the words of our prophet to start with and how brother branham approached this scripture verse now before we start there i i want to say that that reign and the philistine in the in that area of israel there um that climate there that mora that teaching reign is considered the the at the end of october and the beginning of november it's considered the the period of winter the commentator says is from the end of october until the end of march and that rain does not entirely cease that early rain means the first autumnal showers which prepare the arid soil for seed so the early rain is the rain preparing for some kind of seed and the latter rain is later spring showers especially in march which bring forward the crop towards harvest and at that time the crop is then brought forward to harvest not in march when the rain is falling but later on in may is when the wheat harvest is brought forth so that's kind of the the uh the climate that we're talking about the the prophet joel is speaking from and brother branham says in the spoken word is the original seed he says someone asked me to repeat that hebrew word again in joel the second chapter and the word former in is the hebrew word for mora which means teaching in other words it'll be a teaching rain and then also a harvest rain and he says now we've had the teaching rain and we're ready now for the harvest rain is in 1962. now we've had the teaching rain and you know the first drain is when you plant the seed that starts your crop of growing and then just before it matures there comes another crop and that's what they call the harvest rain the spring rains about june it makes your crop and the rain we find out was the spirit so we have this early type that the rain in the bible is a type of the spirit so now in the same sermon brother branham asks the congregation why then has the revival fires let up he says you don't hear very much of billy graham like the great evangelist oral roberts not burning forth a country like he used to and my meanings is not even heard of there's just three and he says what's the matter and isn't that what we ask ourselves even in our own lives is what's the matter now billy graham the world was burning up here long ago with billy graham very sheldon hear of it now billy graham's now gone on in our age so what's the matter who's next what's next for the bride what's next for god's people that's what human naturally looks for he says oral roberts just burning up the earth but dying down now tommy osborne all them good godly men but what's happened and believing that god called me for ministry he says what's happened to mine and you say well brother branham yours is the deadest of them all he says that's that's true that is right 1962. he says that brother brown are you saying that you're telling here's here that you actually believe the word and everything then what's happened to you then what's taken place that's what we want to know now put her down in your mind and i'll pull down the umbrella and shake off the rain and open up your heart here just a minute that's what we want to do tonight is let's open up a heart here just a moment because i think even today we have the same question is what's the matter the coming of the lord is supposed to be upon us what's the matter is my life lining up when i look at all the churches around me are they lining up what's going to take place to get us ready for the coming of the lord what's the matter he says remember the bible said in genesis first chapter that every seed comes after its kind and it will have to bring forth after its kind so i believe that it's near the harvest time and the seeds are being planted now he says oh i wish you could just see what passed before me then oh something is happening i can see it passing before me it's done caught the spirit it's no longer just brother braham speaking as a man but god is coming down on this sermon and quickening it he says amen oh now i know this is the truth it's thus saith the lord by vision see move can't hardly look down here every time i look see it's just and something's happening you see so now we can have we can have certainty that god's inspiring this he says i believe it's near the harvest time the seeds have been planted the denominational siege of the churches such as the evangelicals like the baptist the presbyterian the lutheran and the pentecostal seeds has been panted where into the pentecostal organization by great men like oral roberts and tommy hicks and osborne great men of god and i believe that the word of god has been planted unadulterated away from all those organization now the seed must be planted and then it must have water in order to grow see why did we have it in that planting time it's the former rain he says the teaching rain has went forth and he says now what's the matter now now she is waiting for the latter rain you throw forth all your seeds in that teaching reign but now you have to wait for the laddering to come and quicken it he says that's when she produces her fruits then the kind of seed that you plant in your field will be the kind of crop you'll reap if the denominations want more members that's what they're going to get the pentecostals want more pentecostals the baptists want more baptist well they're going to get that but the word is going to produce sons and daughters of god what's a son and a daughter of god it's that person who has been made a partaker of the divine nature filled with god's holy spirit and identified with the word of god not a creed not a dogma not something that he rece recitates because that's what his his his church says but something that he himself has come into alignment with the word he's recognized it in the word by his own self and something has quickened him not because a man william branham said it not because a man josiah cornett or john martin said it not because as mammy or as pappy said it but because there's something there's a seed on the inside a sieging of god a predestinated seed a very part of god that god made in his own image the same seed that was in adam that god made man in his own image and that seed of god recognizes something in the word and it lines itself up and identifies it and says that's the truth he says he might he might be looking at acts 2 38 for the first time and going back and forth to matthew where it says teach all teach all men to be baptized the name of the father and of the name of the son and the name of the holy ghost and he hears the teaching from the prophet sure but the prophet says well look at acts 2 38 jesus christ is the name of the father the name of the son the name of the holy ghost now it's not just because of prophets teaching it the prophet is just the bible says that the word of the lord comes to the prophet but it's not the prophet that quickens sons and daughters of god it's the word of the lord coming through that vessel god using that vessel behold i'll send elijah my prophet before the great and coming day of the lord to what turn not it's not all about a prophet there's something in that scripture that i identify with my name's in malachi 4 5 and 6. it's not about elijah the prophet it's about those sons and those daughters that have their hearts turned back to the pentecostal fathers and i can say now i recognize what the word is for my life now i recognize i have to be baptized in the name of jesus christ so that i can receive my promises amen the promise of the holy ghost amen so brother brahm says in 1962 they're waiting for that seed to come forth and the kind of see or that rain to come forth and whatever the seed was that's what they're going to get now be careful here because when we when we throw down our seeds a lot of times what we throw down is based upon what we want to see come forth brother branham often taught us to to expect things from god but the fact of the matter is that oftentimes we get what we expect isn't it and it's not just with the word of god but there's a principle here that our expectations yield forth fruit whether that fruit is under godliness or that fruit's off the word if i expect that i'm going to have a bad day even though god intended for me to have a bad day a good day i'm probably going to still have a bad day because that's what i was expecting and brother branham talks about this he says the very next day after the spoken word is the original seed he says they've been talking so much now about a latter rain now remember he just said that we're waiting for that latter rain but now he says they're talking about it and not discarding you ladder rain brethren but that's not latter rain what were they doing they were manufacturing some expectation he says if the latter rain would have been there the power of god would have struck that thing and she would have swept the world the latter rain is fixing to come but what's the matter the church is manufacturing herself something just like eve tried to do and isn't that just about human nature when we start asking ourselves questions like what's the matter well especially the men in the room we want to fix it right away that's that's that's what happens with my wife i ask her what's the matter and i'm i'm asking it because i want to fix the problem and god don't need us to fix his problems matter of fact god don't have any problems but he needs us to catch the movement of the spirit the bible says that sons and daughters of god are led by the spirit of god he wants us to act like his sons and daughters but the church he says is manufacturing herself something she just like eve tried to do she tried to have more light to manufacture something and we've done and gone done the same thing trying to make something in ourselves see keep your hand off of it let god do it take his word and believe it hold that in your heart and the when the rain begins to fall it will take hold and the word will manifest its own self amen you kind of start to see what people's expectations are based on some of the questions that they they ask brother branham and questions the answer is you can pick it up there where someone says with a bride before jesus comes we'll see have all power of the holy ghost perform miracles and raise the dead and so on as in the latter rain or is this the latter rain for the 144 thousand jews will all ministers have this or are we just waiting for the coming isn't isn't that that just shows what people are looking for doesn't it will the will will the bride have all power of the holy ghost to perform miracles raise the dead is this the latter rain well now wait a second if i go back to mark it said that we already had that power that they will they will raise lay hands on the sick the sick will recover they will cast out demons they will bring the dead back to life again and it didn't say anything about weight for the latter rain it said this is the mark of sons and daughters of god those who believe in me will manifest this amen now you may not manifest all those things all the time but those things will be resident within the body of christ so look at how brother branham answers this and it's so good because he doesn't come out and answer it directly because he doesn't i believe it's he addresses more the expectation behind the question because he doesn't ever say well yes they will or will yes they will not that goes without saying but he says the question is can you nurse seems like his answer doesn't have anything to do with a question but he says the real question here is can you nurse so this person's got some kind of expectation probably somebody's saying i need something to happen here and brother brahm says the question is can you nurse it says that same question came to the pentecostals and they couldn't do it they grabbed a breast from the old denomination they came out of but then the real seed to come comes in nurses from that breast see that was the last sign that abraham had before the promised son that they'd waited all these years god was standing in the form of a man and could discern the thoughts that was in sarah's heart it goes back to what happened just before abraham inherited his promise of a son says the last sign that they had was here god came and discerned the thoughts that was in sarah's heart remember when she laughed up her sleeve behind the tent when god said that abraham would have a son and he'd visit him not many days hence and that was the last time i had and then the promise came and after that she chained back to young woman young man isaac was brought forth on the scene the promised son he says now i believe you're seeing the last thing that'll happen to the church before the rapture i believe it the rain is over this is 1964 1962 he said that we're waiting for that rain just two years later he says the rain is over that's what's promised the church right there you notice the other day when we started the trumpets the holy spirit said that don't belong here see we're just now to wait on the coming of the lord just wait keep your lamps trimmed all filled with a spirit pray up every hour not every day just keep ready be sweet and watching the question is what happened 1962 to 1964 what happened he said the rain was there we're waiting for it now he says the rain's over and watch what your expectation is just nurse from god brother graham gives some insight into it earlier in that year of 1964 recognizing your day and its message though how important it is to recognize our day everywhere now he says there's no revival everybody is complaining ministers outstanding papers that comes here to the church a very fine paper and i know the editor and i know the people and they're very fine brother sister moore of the herald is coming one of the finest papers in the field and it's all about fast pray sound of the trumpet fast pray something's about to happen let's make something break forth we're going to have a great breaking day there's going to be something happen all of you pray pray pray we're not too late yet you see that that pressure that anxiety that stress in trying to inject human emotion and human effort into the whole situation how con how in contrast that is to el shaddai the great breasted god who says come and nurse from me fast pray fast pray we're not too late yet something's about to break forth can you nurse from me he says why do they do that they want a great awakening oh watch what you're wanting they're crying believing there will be an awakening and they're good people what have they done they have not recognized the awakening of the bride 1962 to 1964 something happened and these folks didn't recognize it see by being a christian they feel the pull of the hour but they haven't recognized what's been done past tense and that's what's making them feel that way they know that something is supposed to happen but they're looking for it way off in the future to come when it's already happened right by you see friends we're in the time of the coming of the lord now according to just nature believing that god works according to nature and knowing that our type is the type of a wheat we have to realize that the rain isn't what's going to get us there matter of fact the bible even says this it says that as snow and summer and there's rain and harvest so honor is not seemly for a fool it would be just as is as seemly for a fool to have honor as it would be for god to use some special dispensation of grace and pouring forth his spirit to bring us to a final harvest it's the rain that brings them to maturity but in that final harvest we're going to find out what it is that god uses to bring his crops in brother branham says this in modern events made clear by prophecy he says about the wheat he says the shuck held it but now the shuck pulls away and remember 20 years has passed and no more denominations have come of it it won't we're at the end of denominations the wheat has taken shape is 1965. december thereof but what's the matter with the wheat now how he believes your wheat he says what's the matter with you what's the matter with a wheat now is that is that your question some days you get up all the morning and says well if i'm supposed to get in the harvest i feel like what's the matter with me he says it must lay in the presence of the sun to ripen before the combine comes along and picks it up we're not looking for some ladder rain to fall that's already fallen but now we're looking for that combine to pick it up and all we have to do is lay in the presence of jesus christ now we're going to get to what that latter reign was i don't want you to think i'm just going to pass over that but let me take my time and getting there today he says now the events that we're seeing place it's all absolutely shown in the bible of every age we think we're out of cater but we're not everything is just exactly with god's word amen i love it when where he says in the shalom message i've got it here because i found it so encouraging he says now and sometimes we get so discouraged and confused but he says if you can't look up or if you can't look ahead just look up don't even try to look ahead see when we start trying to look ahead that's where we get all these offshoots trying to inject ourselves and make something happen he says don't even try to look up look ahead just look up what is the apostle paul said looking unto jesus not the next day not the next event not the next outpouring not the next next next not what what do i need to do next it's just where is god's hand in my life let me take a hold of that hand let it lead me into the promised land let me be lockstep with god's spirit not trying to figure out where god's going to step next but let me just know where my lord is today and step right behind him and let me be faithful to that relationship that i'm called to if he's calling me to holiness today let me shuck off everything of the world if he's calling me to be a greater witness today let me shuck off my complexes and talk the person down at the gas station let me just be led of god and not worry about where god's going he said that he would lead me he would guide me he would send me into all truth he said he wouldn't point the way oh hallelujah god don't point the way friends god said that he would lead you and guide you as a shepherd does a sheep amen amen praise the lord i'm glad that he don't make me some some kind of bull or some kind of horse and send me off on my way he calls me his sheep his little lamb he takes me by his tender staff and leads me all the way to promised land amen don't look ahead just look up put your hand in hands he says let him lead you look up done ahead amen but then we come back to asking ourselves well what happened in between 1962 and 1965 there was some kind of there was some kind of rain that came forth there was some kind of a revival brother branham said that we were looking for it 1965 the invisible union of the bride of christ he says watch then the spiritual bride when she begins to have a revival watch the fruits of it it's not empty out all the hospitals it's not some public display of the people it's not all these outward manifestations when she begins to come back and line herself up with the word of god whoa hallelujah so that's where the bride's revival is the invisible union of the bride and the bridegroom lining herself up with what christ the word that's what we're being called to if you want to know what do i need to do to get ready for a rapture just ask yourself what is the rapture why it's just the call to the marriage supper that's all it's just a call to the wedding feast so my question to tonight is are you married are you ready for the wedding feast don't try to make yourself well i haven't i haven't raised the dead yet or i haven't checked off this spiritual accomplishment i haven't spoken in tongues yet i haven't done this i i haven't i haven't i haven't ask yourself what has he done in my life how much have i allowed him to do in my life am i allowing him to bring me into one minute with him one man isn't just doing the works of christ one man is knowing christ and having his character having his spirit amen you know he said that there would be many that would come to me in that day and he would say lord lord many works have we done in your name and yet he would say depart from me for i never even knew you i would rather be the person that never did any works but knew him and still believed in his works in my life and told others of the same than to be the one that was so hypocritical is to tell everyone about jesus christ but never come into real fellowship with him tell my children about christ tell the people at work about christ but really i never came to know him let me not be that that is what we're striving for that's where the bride's revival is when she begins to come back and line herself up with the word of god he says watch then again you'll see how the scriptures at that time there will be a message to come out and sweep and catch that bride catch that woman elect oh i believe that's the message that we're hearing today a message that's prophesying again to god's bride though the though the prophet has gone off the scene yet there's a five-fold message five-fold ministry that's repeating that message and that's what's catching the bride in this last hour so where is the bride's revival the bride's revival is in the word brother branham in restoration the bride tree he teaches us that those four critters that came there and ate away at the bride tree the palmer worm and the locust and the cankerworm the caterpillar he said that that's a type of the four restorations that had to come so the first restoration was justification under underneath luther he says the just shall live by faith and wesley comes along and brings a message to shape up the church and get her to you know take off the worldliness a message of sanctification then you see the azusa street revival and and the gifts and pentecost got hung up on all the gifts and she did exactly the opposite of what the apostle paul told her to do the apostle paul speaking to the early church he said follow after church charity and desire spiritual gifts notice he didn't say it the other way around he didn't say follow after spiritual gifts and desire charity secondarily he said follow after charity which is love which is god follow after him follow after that relationship with christ but now that doesn't mean that we shuck off all the gifts that god restored to us so i think it'd be a pretty poor bride indeed that didn't appreciate a few roses from her husband every once in a while didn't appreciate some gifts on mother's day didn't appreciate some some kind of gift giving but that's not what we're in it for is it i i know my wife didn't marry me because i gave her a pretty looking ring on her finger she appreciated it she desired it i'll even say she desired it she desired a pretty looking ring but what was it there was something behind that that token symbolized the gift is just a symbol of god's love and there's where we want to follow after so what's the fourth thing that could be restored it was the word itself underneath the malachi 4 5 ministry notice i didn't say the holy ghost was restored because the holy ghost was there all along we didn't just start receiving the holy ghost at the end of this age the baptism of the holy ghost was to all believers acts 2 38 that this promise is unto you and unto your children and as many as we believe even as those that are far off so all through the ages we have the holy ghost but what was the difference now brother branham said the difference now was that that church had been bound had bound the holy ghost for nearly 2 000 years underneath martyrdom back there under the church ages and they bound the holy ghost at the door of creeds and dogmas so that the holy ghost could not work but she that church is going to be liberated she is coming back and that's what the bible said the holy spirit has been bound in these denominational rivers for almost 2 000 years but is to be loosed again in the evening time by the evening time message he didn't say it but i'll say by the evening time messenger because it's the word that comes to prophets and the holy spirit back in the church again christ himself revealed in human flesh in the eating time bound by what bound by creation dogmas like the days of miracles are passed that took away people's faith in god's word well he was he received stripes for your healing but i don't know how i don't know how they preach it but the days of miracles are passed so that god only does your healing in smaller ways he doesn't do miraculous healings so we're gonna we're gonna start compartmentalizing god's power and the way that god's going to manifest himself to you and so they'll teach that the book of acts was just a template to show god's power but and to to get the message to spread through the world but then he kind of dialed it back a little bit but what does that do to people's faith faith in a god that not that they walk away and don't believe god anymore but they don't believe that god can affect them in the way that god wants to be able to manifest himself to them what about what about the the doctrine of serpency why does that matter how does that how does that bind the holy ghost by man's creeds and dogmas can we just be real here i i why does it matter why does it matter what what impact does it have to you that you've been taught the doctrine of the serpent seed and what really happened in the garden well for one thing i don't believe in a fairy tale when i go back in the bible and i start reading about her grabbing a apple or a pear or something off the tree and all of a suddenly she recognizes that she's naked and she grabs a hold of that apple and gives it to her husband and he recognizes that he's naked it doesn't make any sense to me matter of fact the only reason why it makes sense to people i think is because they've been raised up in it since they were children when fairy tales made sense but when you start realizing that it was a sex act in the garden that is the the the the same thing that made you and i realized that we were naked is the same thing that made adam and eve realize that they were naked that they that they lost their innocence at that time then the bible makes sense now it's no longer a story and now the continuity of scripture can be kept and now it's something that i can have faith in and i can see that that the scripture is solid from genesis to revelations and that it makes sense to me and then if that makes sense to me then everything has to make sense to me and i can start knocking on i can start knocking on the scripture and it's like it's like when you're knocking on a wall you look for the hollow spots and when you when you come across something solid you know that's something you can you can drive a hammer and a nail into and before maybe you you came across the scripture and said well i don't i don't really understand that but that's what everybody teaches so we'll just kind of go with it that it was an apple or maybe this denomination says it's a pear it feels kind of hollow i i'll just move on to the stuff that i really know about like calvary and these fundamentals but it's all christ it's all the word of god so there's something in this word that doesn't make sense to you now you can keep on knocking on it until you find a hollow place and say god and there are still many scriptures for me that i come across and say god i don't understand this but i'm not going to set it aside i might set up a set up on a shelf for a while but i want you to bring together the continuity of scripture and if i if it's not continuous for me then i know i'm not looking at it right and bring it and bring genesis into line with revelation until every book in the bible lines up for me and now we can have faith in it what about baptism in the name of jesus christ there's another thing that was bound by man's creeds and dogmas baptism in the name of the father in the name of the son the holy ghost but what was it it was a baptism without a promise because we weren't baptized according to acts 2 38 that says repent and be baptized in the name of jesus christ and then you shall receive the gift of the holy ghost but now i can have faith and say now that i understand what i'm doing and i understand that jesus christ is how god revealed himself to this world that he is the father and the son and the holy ghost that it's one god just changing his mask as it were and i know who i serve and i'm not a polytheist i believe in one god and not in three separate persons but in different manifestations to man that jesus that jesus christ is jehovah of the old testament and jehovah of the old testament is jesus of the new and when i'm looking at the old testament i'm looking at the jesus in the new testament i'm looking at the same person i'm looking at the same god the same characteristics this is just a slightly different manifestation and now i can get down in those waters and say i'm going to be baptized the name of jesus christ today and when i raise up from these waters i'm identifying myself with jesus christ i know who i'm identifying myself with i'm not questioning whether i'm identifying part of myself with the holy ghost and part of myself with god the father and part of myself with the son like somebody said i didn't as a trinitarian said i didn't know who i was praying to so i split my prayers up between the three of them so they wouldn't get jealous of one another what kind of confusion is that that's what satan wants to do is because when we start having confusion enter in it breaks down faith introduces doubt and now you can't stand solid as a christian but the christian that has a revelation of the name of jesus christ can get down the waters and say when i get up from these waters today i will hold within my hand the token of god's promise for the holy ghost and if god don't give me the problem the promise of the holy ghost and manifest it to me as soon as i break forth from those waters i'm gonna hold acts 2 38 in my hand until he blesses me with an outpouring and a sealing of the holy ghost the earnest of my inheritance until the day of my redemption and i can walk solemn that and i can say i didn't get it yesterday but i'm holding on to the promise just like abraham i didn't get my son yesterday but i'm holding on to the promise just like noah i didn't get a flood yesterday but i'm holding on to the promise i'm building this ark and one a day after i one day i'm going to be sealed with pits from within and i without and when the judgment falls and the rains come that holy ghost will hold me oh hallelujah i tell you what as a christian if i got baptized in in the name of jesus christ i broke forth from those waters i wouldn't fear one bit if a car came and hit me afterwards because i'm still holding on to the promise of god in his scripture maybe i didn't feel the holy ghost maybe i didn't interpret it correctly that i had gotten it or not but i'm still i would still walk up to those pearly grates and say lord i maybe i just didn't know what i was talking about didn't know what i was feeling i don't know if i'm holding the holy ghost right now but i know one thing i'm holding i'm still holding on to your promise i did everything i knew how to do i was true to the revelation you gave me and i'm holding on to acts 2 38 oh i believe those pearly greats would swing open for me that's the difference now that now that holy ghost was resident within the the body of christ all those years but bound by creeds and dogmas now we can take a hold of it and have faith and confidence towards it amen oh hallelujah so where are we at now then i don't believe we're fullest virgin here tonight remember the foolish virgin when they recognized that it was the hour to have oil in their lamps they went out and they went with those who sold the oil in the markets but there was a group that already had the oil and i believe there's a group sitting here tonight that already had the oil and you didn't buy it with your money you didn't buy it with your efforts but you bought it by simply nursing from el shaddai believing on his promises and it was given to you so what do we do in this hour then i believe we do according to isaiah 60 verse 1 where the prophet tells us arise and shine for thy light has come and the glory of the lord has risen upon thee for behold the darkness shall cover the earth and gross darkness the people but the lord shall arise and shine upon thee rise up and do what trim our lamps if your lamp has started to smoke over don't think that it's that you need some new revival some new denomination some new movement within the message some new camp meeting i believe that you can get everything that god has for you right here in this church it's the word that you need friends and if your lamp is smoking up it's time to just simply trim it maybe trim some worldliness out of your life maybe trim some time out of your day so you can commit yourself to growing your roots as a as a wheat waiting for harvest and saying i know that rain has already fallen let me just grow my roots until i can grab a hold of it and reach down in this soil that god's planted me in and suck up this message suck up this word suck up this this beautiful outpouring of god's revelation that he's given us amen it's not to a group it's not some special dispensation of grace that we're still waiting for so i don't preclude that god would still work in that way i just say that our prophet said this he said i don't see anything that's left for the church now but the coming of the lord just keep your lamps trimmed and shine for him so that's all i can tell to you is just to keep your lamps trimmed so it's not a group but it's as we see in the laodicean church age is to whomsoever will open unto me behold i stand at the door and knock to whomsoever will open the door unto me i'll come in and i'll stop with them are you opening the door to christ oh that's different now isn't it right that's a little bit less comfortable because now we've got to look inward instead of looking outward pray fast pray pray something's about to break forth something is coming some great whoosh of the spirit is coming some torrential downpour that'll just carry us all away and we'll be helpless against it that's that's what the flesh wants something that just washes all of our troubles away but he says in laodicea i'm knocking at your heart's door are you going to open to me are you going to open to me on thursday morning are you going to come and sup with me are we going to dine together brother branham said it this way and trying to do sir got a service without it being his will he said i believe it was some nobleman that went over to wales to understand and figure out what all the mechanics was in the revival during the welsh revival does that just sound like us humans figure out what all the mechanics are write it down on notepad take it back home package it and and produce it on the shores of america and when they got off the ships with their tall hats and round collars a little policeman they found swinging his club around like that and they said my good man can you tell me where the welsh revival is how many remember where this little welshman said the revival was he said it's in me you're staring at it you're facing it right now the welsh revival is in me well i got something some news for you tonight there's something bigger than the welsh revival tonight there's a global revival there's a bright age that's broken forth there's a arising and a shining of jesus christ upon his people there's a bride's revival that's upon us the question is can you identify yourself with it and say you're looking at it you're looking at the bride's revival my i and my lord are in communion it's an invisible union you cannot see it but it's happening every moment of every day and i'm identified with it oh hallelujah let's stand tonight praise the lord and as you're standing i want to read just one verse james the practical apostle he says in chapter 5 be patient therefore brethren oh i believe that stands true to the church tonight as we wait for god's coming be patient unto the coming of the lord behold the husbandman waiteth for the precious through the earth he waits for those tender grapes as it were and he hath long patience for it until he received the early and the latter rain be also patient he says that a couple of times must be important amen be patient and what does he tell us to do he says establish your hearts for the coming of the lord draweth night amen so i hope i can just leave you with that tonight friends if if you're wanting a restoration with god if you're wanting revival to be revitalized in christ establish your hearts and what god has already given to us amen he's given us great and precious promises he gave us elijah he gave us malachi 4 5 and 6. he revealed his word to to our hearts establish yourself make sure you're established in the present truth and i believe that there you'll find that that maturity that you're looking for don't look for another rain but make sure that you're printing the presence of the sun ripening before the combine comes and picks us up mark if you would come and we'll go ahead and close the service in the word of prayer dear lord jesus we just come before you father lord we're so appreciative of the word that you've given to our hearts lord a word of the lord that we can have confidence in the lord i remember the prophet that he said the the greatest vindication of my ministry i was on the edge of my seat when i read those words maybe it was the resurrection of the dead the cloud in the sky the pillar of fire above his head he said the greatest vindication of my ministry is the fruit that it brings forth in the hearts and the lightest believers lord i believe that that ministry was the ministry of jesus christ through your servant i wanted to go and accomplish everything that set out to do lord in my life i believe that would be the prayer of each person here lord maybe just with a lifted hand now we would each symbolize as a token to you lord that that is our desire that there would be a fruit that would be brought forth lord a harvest a crop a mature wheat lord granite lord may we each do our part each day to expose ourselves to that sunlight that christ light that word that you've given so we can become mature sun
