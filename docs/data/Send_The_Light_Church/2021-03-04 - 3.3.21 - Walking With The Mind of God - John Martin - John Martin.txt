lord may you draw us closer lord through this service may we become more like you mourn your image and be able to walk more just like you walk lord we thank you for these things we commit the service now to you and pray and ask your blessings and the reading of the word we give you the praise in jesus precious name amen and amen god bless you turn with me if you would to the book of philippians chapter 2 and we're going to read just one verse of scripture there that we had read last service uh last service we uh entitled that walking with god and today we want to entitle this message walking with the mind of god amen and we're just i think it's it's a great need in this hour that we're we're living in amen but just one verse there let this mind be in you which was also in christ jesus amen god bless you may be seated just before our men's meeting today brother boaz had called from india wanted to give each of you uh greetings from him and wish that he could be here this was a month that he did try to come and with the culvert and basically the culvert restrictions now uh that they require um it's really put a damper on him coming but let's pray for him his one hand he cannot use he can't grab and if he does he he can't get it back and so surgery is too expensive and the other hospitals are full of covet situations so he he needs divine intervention from the lord if we could just remember to pray for him we we did pray with him on the phone but i just believe that collectively if we could pray together it would it would get the job done amen amen well um this thought on the mind of of god is is important um brother branham told us that we are in the greatest battle that was ever fought amen and every day we're just in great battles they only got to be doing anything and we're in a great battle but i i want to testify today that god is walking around with peace and when we walk with the mind of god we too can have peace in the message god provided place of worship brother branham said the world would go insane just quoting him he says it's not but just about one degree right now yes and that was in 1964. it's got to be it's got to be there amen i believe that things are are are so perverted the world is getting crazier by the day it's on such a rampant speed you can't believe any of the news it's lies upon lies opinions over facts we can't keep up with the immorality and the perversion what the world calls right is wrong confusion compounding confusion the lgbt is increasing faster than it ever was before children are getting to make their own decision on what gender they're going to be this is the world that we're living in it's going insane according to revelations chapter 12 verse 11 satan deceiveth the whole world well we see it it's happening second corinthians chapter four verse says in whom the god of this world has blinded the minds of them which believe not how important it is to believe the word when you hear it because as soon as you don't believe it your mind gets blind lest the light of the glorious gospel of christ who's in the image of god should shine upon them now this is really important sometimes we don't know what to believe because you know i remember coming to christ as a young christian i didn't know nothing really about the bible and and you don't know what to believe but you got to believe something you got to take a stand somewhere and um i know that if i needed my car fixed i would rather i would rather follow brother bruce then follow anne and when god brings you to the truth he's going to lead and guide you into all truth amen that's just his promise second timothy chapter 3 verse 13 speaking of the time that we're living in the bible says but evil men and seducers shall wax worse and worse deceiving and being deceived this is the hour that we're living in what do we need to do what do we do in this this condition he tells timothy in verse 14 but continue thou in the things which thou has learned and has been assured of anoint who uh whom thou has learned them knowing of whom thou has learned then the prophet came and gave us a message brother bruce came up here and he said this this is not my surprise what's happening the prophet warned us he told us just continuing the message continue in the word amen the bible says there'll be scoffers all around us many are leaving what they once believed there's a great falling away the bible says church-going people who have become more in love with themselves than ever before to the point that they're loving pleasures more than their loving god right just just my bible they become bolsters proud unthankful unholy making the sanctuary mourn holy fierce false accusers traitors heady high-minded despisers of those we're not speaking of those who go to bars we're speaking of the church despisers of those who are trying to do their best jude mentioned spots in your feast of charity when they feast with you feeding themselves without fear making the sanctuary just a place of them instead of god's house iniquity is abounding the love of many is waxing cold this is the hour that we're living in we need to be walking with the mind of christ jesus speaking of the very hour that we're living in in matthew 24 verse 36 he says but of that day speaking of his returning and the hour no man knoweth not even the angels in heaven but my father only. and so he goes on to continue he says but as the days of noah where so shall it be also in the coming of the son of man first for as in the days that were before the flood they were eating and drinking marrying given in marriage until the day noah entered into the ark in other words it is no different you couldn't tell you couldn't tell by those signs it's the same thing as happening they're they're eating they're drinking they're marrying they're giving it to marriages it's just the way it was then so you couldn't tell and knew not until the flood came and took them all away so shall also the coming of the son of man be you won't be able to tell by those signs i'm glad that god sent a prophet because we can see a lot a lot clearer than just the eating and drinking and giving in the marriage but there's another thing that happened in the days of noah that's happening today in genesis chapter 6 verse 5 and god saw that the wickedness of man was great in the earth and that every imagination of the thoughts of his heart were only evil continually we need to be walking with the mind of god this is the hour where man is thinking evil continually amen amen i think there's something that we all could testify of and that is the last that we have listened to the news the better our mind has been true it affects the way that we think i think we need to stop listening to the bad news and start listening to the good news it will help a lot of times we don't realize how bad our thinking actually becomes until somebody says what are you talking about what do you saying what are you doing this was the mind of god that god had about blind leaders and that's i think a lot what we listen to in the news matthew chapter 15 verse 14. and i think we should walk with it i think we should walk with what god's teaching is here he says let them alone they be blind leaders of the blind and if the blind lead the blind both shall fall into the ditch then answered peter and said unto him declare unto us this parable and jesus said are ye also yet without understanding do you not understand that whatsoever entereth into the mouth goes into the valley and is cast out and to draw okay we eat every day we understand what that means but think of this though things you eat not everything comes out in other words it gives you body energy it helps you right that goes to your cells gives you a nutrients all your organs can work for out of the heart proceedeth evil thoughts murders adulterers fornication theft false witness blasphemies these are the things which defile man and not to eat with unwashed hands defileth not a man out it's not here's the thing we're going to listen to a bunch of bad news or bad reports or stuff like that and i understand that you know we just kind of like yeah get it out right but there's some of that stuff that's going to affect you and out of the heart perceive evil thoughts judgmental thoughts things we're living in an insane world where people are thinking insanely i used to think it's true like but brother random said we're oddballs but i'm telling you the world is the real oddballs yes they're they're just crazy it's hard to act normal in front of them you want to ask them a thousand questions why they asking why you're dressing while you're doing what you're doing this is not normal but the world is just going in that direction proverbs 25 25 says as cold waters to a thirsty soul imagine you're being thirsty and getting some cold water so is good news from the far country amen why would we want to listen to cnn and what's happening in syria imagine what bad news does for the soul what i got here is hot water on a soul that's been saturated by the world doesn't do you any good you already are saturated you don't need it and on top of it it's hot bad news fills people's minds with fear hopelessness and hatred that's what bad news does because you can't take it after a while you just want to hate that is the truth a sound mind or the mind of god is not a gift to us whether we want it or not that's right in fact first john chapter 4 verse 1 says believe not every spirit amen you have to try the spirit to see whether it's of god or not it's not a gift jesus told peter satan would desire to sift you as wheat that's where his mind is at that's what he wants to do he wants to confuse you torment you day and night with fear confuse you and leave you feeling hopeless what do i do in my situation that's the devil that's the mind of the devil and we feel the effects of the devil every day if the mind of god was a gift we'd all take it because we need it we don't like dealing with his stuff but paul told timothy that this sound mind comes with the holy ghost second timothy chapter 1 verse 7 for god have not given us the spirit of fear but a power and of love and of a sound mine now how many's got the holy ghost humming's battling having to sound mine so how do we activate it how do we activate it verse 6 is the answer wherefore i put thee in remembrance that thou stir up the gift of god which is in thee by the putting on of hands well we know the holy ghost is a gift to god but it has to be stirred up you have to to kindle it i mean we we make fires every day and if you do not keep putting the wood on that fire it will begin to smolter and when it smolders and you try to put a big log on it ain't gonna go because you let it get too low right so what you have to do is rekindle it with just a little bit what you're doing is you're rekindling your attitude with god i say let's spend more time stirring up the gift of god inside of each one of us because we need a sound mind in this hour that we're living in now you can praise them and that will help but i want to ask the question why did the fire go out to begin with was it because you stopped praising him i think one way to stir up the gift of god which is in thee is to simply humble yourself before the lord amen first peter chapter 5 verse 5 likewise ye younger submit yourselves to the elder ya i'll be subject one to another be clothed with humility for god resisteth the proud and gives grace to the humble you want to rekindle get humble put the clothes of humility on verse six humble yourselves therefore under the mighty hand of god and he will exalt you in due time in other words you will feel that power that love and the sound mind that's already in you you just got to stir it up casting all your care upon him for he careth for you but don't try to do it with pride you got to do it with humility the world's got problems and a lot of them complain to god if you really do this you wouldn't do you would allow this and this wouldn't be happening you'd help me with this pride they don't want to humble themselves before the lord you humble yourself before then you cast all your cares upon the lord he cares for us but he doesn't he's not going to go beyond your pride just because he cares for you in other words if you don't care in the relationship to respect god to give him the respect that he deserves we can't go to god in that holiest of holies with that kind of attitude i need you right now humble yourselves under the mighty hand those chair fins the wings are stretched out humble yourself under the mighty hand of god that he may exalt you in due time don't cast your cares upon other humans god wants that relationship with you look at this great battle here verse 8 be sober be vigilant be sober be vigilant because your adversary the devil as a roaring lion walketh about seeking whom he may devour he's looking for a mind that is weak that is unbelieving that is proud that is arrogant because he can devour them whom resists steadfast in the faith knowing that the same afflictions the same things that you're going through are accomplished in your brethren around the world and i heard that testimony from brother boaz today the things that are going on that the cove and the problems and the people who are dying over there we're not alone but we need the mind of christ we need it to be in us and we do that by humbling ourselves before the lord no matter what the state is humble yourself let this mind be in you which was also in christ jesus this mind we talked a little bit about it no reputation took the form of a servant in verse 8 and being found in the fashion as a man he humbled himself and became obedient even unto death wherefore god also have highly exalted him the same thing that peter is telling us to do is the same thing that the father did for jesus he humbled himself under the mighty hand of the father and he exalted him in due time and as he makes the same promise to us if we follow the example that jesus did we follow his steps for this for this us oh let's let's oh for this for this what for this what for this what why isn't it coming first peter chapter 2 verse 21 first peter chapter 2 verse 21 for here unto were you called because christ also suffered for us leaving us an example that we should follow his steps right there i want god i need god to give me a sound mind as i'm going through what i'm going through amen that's right i want god i want to walk with the mind of god i can't stop what's coming at me i don't even know what's coming at me but just knowing what i go through on a on a daily basis you can almost think that anything's going to happen we need to stir up the gift of god that's inside of us we need to stir up that holy ghost and say god i need it well you you you have to humble yourself to do that because you can't force god god is humble he said learn to me from meek and lowly the mind of god in christ humbled himself and became obedient unto death the death of the cross i think the mind of of god inside of us will do the same thing isaiah 57 15 says i dwell with him also that is of a contrite and humble spirit god testifies who he's walking with amen he's walking with the humble amen walking with the mind of god sometimes we can get our boldness mixed up with our arrogance oftentimes we may think we're walking with the mind of god and being bold but in reality it's pride and prejudice or arrogance there is a difference between boldness and arrogance remember the story of the old lion that roared the loudest a lion's roar as loud as 114 decibels that's about 25 times louder than a gas-powered lawnmower and can be heard from as far as five miles away that could be holly from here lyndon some researchers believe that a lion's roar can paralyze humans lions live in packs they can be sometimes 30. but usually it's not that many and the head of every pack or pride he's there's a master there's a master lion and he just stays master but eventually he gets old and the young lions they get stronger you know what i mean like they get like you know for the mark and uh they want to take over and the master lion he knows that he'd get whipped if he took mark on so what does he do he roars louder it's true and he tries to manipulate and scare the other lions from taking over the master position it's a lot what i say happens with arrogance boldness can handle the situation without acting like it in fact at the same time boldness carries a spirit of meekness galatians chapter six verse one brethren if if a man be overtaken in a fault ye which are spiritual restore such a one in a spirit of meekness considering thyself lest thou also be tempted so here's someone that has boldness they can handle the situation and they they they are restoring with a spirit of meekness to me that's the bible says the bold uh the righteous or as bold as a lion but arrogance is usually walking around with a loud mouth struggling handling situations with a spirit of uniqueness so they got to use a different spirit to kind of you know manipulate it scare it learning me from meek and lowly we need to learn more about jesus when john turned his head and he saw the lion to see the lion what did he see a lamb he overcame by becoming a lamb we want to overcome our situations we want to have the boldness of the holy ghost we need to humble ourselves with the mind of god we can never go by what we think as an absolute because every man is right in his own eyes that's why the prophet taught us i could be wrong about anything that's why james said we should never say we're going to do this we should say the lord willing amen amen not just knowing it but believing it and acting like you really believe it i could be wrong now that's the right spirit that's walking with the mind of christ amen it means walking with a humble mind i'd like to talk about three minds for a second the mind of god the mind of satan and the mind of man the mind of god is the highest rank or order in correct and absolute thinking isaiah chapter 55 verse 7 god testifying he says for let the wicked forsake his way and the unrighteous man his thoughts now i'm not sure i don't believe in labeling anybody but i believe if i'm not thinking right i'm being unrighteous with my thoughts and let him return to the lord and knows we can grieve the lord at any time the way we think did not why did why was god so um was it important to get brother branham the message make sure you tell the people that their thoughts are speaking louder in heaven than their words do on earth god is interested in them so if we return to the lord he will have mercy upon him and to our god for he will abundantly pardon for my thoughts are not your thoughts i just want to make that real clear let's separate the mind of god from us for my thoughts are not your thoughts neither are your ways my way saith the lord for as the heavens are higher than the earth so are my ways then your ways and my thoughts then your thoughts if you're gonna walk with the mind of god you're going to walk with the highest order of thinking amen according to the scriptures they're higher than the where we're at now the mind of satan is the lowest rank or order in correct and absolute thinking he believes that his thoughts are actually higher than god's i will be like the most high i will sit on the mountain of god i will set my throne above the throne of god so he's his thinking is that it's higher but is actually the lowest because you can't get higher than god the brightness of satan's own ability actually blinded him from correct and absolute thinking so we can conclude that his way of thinking is simply perverted simply perverted now the mind of man was born with the same mindset that satan has he doesn't want to have to do the will of his creator he wants to do his own thing he wants to be like the most high he wants to call the shots for his life this is the mind of satan man is born with the same satanic perverted thought process he thinks arrogantly he's right all the time you can't tell him he's wrong he's selfish he's judgmental he wants his own will above gods and the mindset of the church believer has become where his desires for his will has become above his desires for god's will romans chapter 8 verse 7 says but the carnal mind is enmity against god for it is not subject to the law of god and i want you to read this with me neither indeed can be for they that are after the flesh they do mind the things of the flesh they are the spirit the things of the spirit for to be carnally minded is death but to be spiritually minded is notice life and peace that's right that's the mind of god right there life and peace so then they that are in the flesh cannot please god so the mind of man is the same as the mind the mind of satan anybody know the song my way frank sinatra it took a few minutes looked it up first and last verse the writer says and now the end is near and so i face the final curtain my friend i'll say it clear i'll state my case of which i'm certain i've lived a life that's full i've traveled each and every highway and more much more than this i did it my way did not jesus say in matthew chapter 16 verse 26 for what is a man profited if he shall gain the whole world and lose his own soul or what shall he give in exchange for his soul luke chapter 9 verse 25 says for what is a man's advantage if he gained the whole world and lose himself or be a castaway right most people walk around they don't even know they got a soul they don't know they got a soul they think this how they think what they are this is who they are there's nothing beyond this so get what you can get out of life so what are we going to profit by gaining everything that we want to to do it our own way look at this last verse for what is a man what has he got if not himself then he has not is it there's nothing else besides me to say the things he truly feels and not the words of one who kneels my the record shows i took the blows and i did it my way that's the mind of a man and just because we sit in church doesn't mean we're free from satan trying to get you to do it your way man is not born with a neutral mind he is born with ssms yeah i made that up it's satan it's selfish satanic mindset that's what he's born with selfish satanic mindset he's born heading straight to hell if he listens to himself his way of thinking his attitude that god is trying to stop him but he can't stop him without that person accepting what he's telling him it's just like judgmental thinking did you know babies are born with it babies are born with it they will actually manipulate and try to make you feel bad just to get their selfish way and you on top top of it they will literally judge you wrong for not giving them what they want they never say thank you for taking care of me the whole last week they're interested in what they want right now look at the mind of god god does not walk around with a judgmental attitude he doesn't walk around with judgmental thoughts now i know i'm saying a lot of explosive things here but you'll see it uh god helping us to get through this but the mind of satan he's the accuser of the brethren but the mind of man he's always judging always judging hitler judge the jews the minorities are judging the majorities of racism is that true it's all right for the sexual perverted to judge us wrong for our stand but we're wrong if we take a stand against perversion everyone sees a reason to be judging somebody else man's thoughts are very judgmental but not gods god's thoughts are not judgmental god has reserved final judgment for the white throne i just want to by the grace of god rightly divide this luke chapter 13 verse 1 there were present at that season some that told him of the galileans whose blood pilate had mingled with the sacrifice with their sacrifices and jesus answering and said unto them suppose you that these galileans were sinners above all the galileans because they suffered worse things supposedly in other words are you going to judge this he says i tell you nay but except you repent ye shall likewise perish of those 18 upon whom the tower of shalom fell and slew them think ye that they were sinners above all men who draw jerusalem i tell you nay but except you repent you shall likewise perish so you see the the very mindset of people that that judge took a look at the woman that was caught in adultery man wanted to judge her to death yes we found her an act let's do it let's don't this is what moses said let's do it at the same time they were wanting to prove that the present ministry was off the word. they wanted to catch jesus they wanted to catch jesus because the word says stone them but they didn't know that there was a god of grace standing there it wasn't a god of judgment he didn't say i come to judge the world but i came to save the world but he that refuses me in the words that i have spoken the same shall judge him in that day he said so the hour had not come so jesus said to the accusers he that's without sin let him cast the first stone in other words bring the white throne judgment on but jesus thoughts towards her were thoughts of peace to give her an expected him see men's judgments are without mercy amen that's why god said vengeance is mine saith the lord i will repay judge not that ye be not judged blessed are the merciful for they shall obtain mercy judge nothing before its time god's judgments today are full of mercy he's sitting on the throne of mercy but don't let the devil tell you that god is off the throne of mercy when he's trying to trick you to get you to judge somebody amen god's way of thinking is merciful today his judgments towards you are with mercy to give you an expected end that's what the bible tells us i'll ask you this question you believe that with all your heart don't you don't you believe that that that god's thoughts towards you or have mercy and he wants to give you an expected end why would god's judgments towards the people that you're having problems with be without mercy then it goes to show you that you're not thinking with the mind of god you're thinking with satan's mind and you don't even realize it because satan comes and he appears he sits on the throne judging right as if he's god and because we're not trying the spirit to see whether it's of god or not we just oh every man is right in his own eyes god's thoughts are higher than the white throne judgment thoughts today they're higher everyone's walking around judging but god's not doing that god's thoughts are restoration peace repentance the renovation of the way that we think he's doing everything he can to help man come to the truth to keep walking in the truth jeremiah chapter 29 verse 11 for i know the thoughts that i think towards you saith the lord these are these higher thoughts now high thoughts thoughts of peace a thought of peace is high and not of evil to give you an expected end amen doesn't that make you want to praise him amen so praise is a high response and a high thought with god then you shall call upon me and you shall go and you shall pray unto me and i will hearken unto you and you shall seek me and find me when you search for me with arrogance uh part time with pride humbleness humble enough to seek him with everything that you got that's when you find god for your situations we must be transformed by the way that we think a new way of thinking we can't be thinking like what we were born with like i'm intelligent satan's intelligence is different than god's intelligence no man is born with ssms selfish satanic mindset god has given him the capability to choose a different way of thinking that's where we type in that's where we can get in that's where we can change things around because god has given us the ability to make a choice in the way that we're going to think if you want to choose a different lifestyle then you'll first have to choose a different way of thinking i mean you know this you you want to lose weight or you want to get some muscles or whatever you can't choose the lazy boy cheese puffs the rest of your life you have to change the way that you think i can't do this and get where i want to go you can't just choose to be lazy in your mind and your thoughts and think well god's still going to help me no that ain't it amen if you want to choose the highest form of intelligence correct and absolute thinking you must humble yourself before your creator i am wrong i repent lord help me now you have put your thoughts right where they need to be like paul when god made him when god made himself known to paul paul immediately in his condition said lord what would thou have me to do and he realized it took time but he realized that he had to forsake everything all the other intelligence that he learned with his uh carnal human mind amen amen that's right i'm better than you know he was racist too he was going up to the christians everybody that was in this way god's word and god's will is an absolute above all of man's thinking you know i know think about this before we were christians before we were christians we used to listen to the news listen to teachers get all of our information and we formulated our absolute this is absolute right this is absolute truth this is where we stand now we become christians and we learn that god reveals himself to us he speaks a still small voice and he makes it clear what absolute is right well we're not going to find that being stuck in a carnal mindset that's like keeping yourself proud haughty arrogant and saying god uh come to my level it's not gonna happen that's why it's so important to have a a right heart a prepared heart jesus himself told us that there were four different types of ground four different types of attitude four different types of heart conditions and he only responds to the one that's good ground no matter if the other ones were christians right because they heard the word they rejoiced they said amen with the word but after a while they got offended paul gave the same counsel in romans chapter 12 verse 1 that that that he experienced on the road to damascus he says i beseech you therefore brother and by the mercies of god that you present your body a living sacrifice wow now if i was to say i want you to present your car a sacrifice to me well we've all seen those uh derby shows what are they called brother bruce where they go and they smash one another demolition derby you take your car out there and you got a number on it and you know after this race that thing is done you're not going to revive it and they smash one another's car and who's ever left going around they're the king well if you're going to present your body a living sacrifice don't let satan tell you it's just for 60 minutes after this i'm going to go do my own thing you're missing what church is about you're missing about what it takes to come into the image of god amen we need to feed with the fear of the lord amen i beseech you therefore brother by the mercies of god that you present your body a living sacrifice holy and acceptable unto god which is your reasonable service so pretty much if we're not doing that we're giving god unreasonable service we're serving him but unreasonably and be not conformed to this world we were on this sunday but be transformed by the renewing of your mind that ye may prove what is that good and acceptable and perfect will of god amen but i wanted to get the verse before and the verse after for i say through the grace given unto me to every man that is among you not to think of himself more highly than he ought to think because that's where satan is at right but to think soberly according as god is doubt to every man the measure of faith now what is that the voice of god spoken to you personally yes amen don't if in other words if you haven't heard that voice speak to you then you don't think highly of it don't think just stay there until you hear from god i know this is clear as anything god speaks often and it's not revelation to you he's trying to get your attention he's trying to get you to get in a place where you will humble yourself and you will listen brother branham says if it lines up with the word it's him if it dovetails from genesis to revelations it's him but if it deviates in any way so a lot of times god speaks to us it's him it's his word he's trying to get the message across to us amen and if it don't come like a boat of lightning and shake us and throw us on the ground and make us feel well probably wasn't god but if we're humble lord i need to hear from you don't think above god's way of thinking don't think about it because that's what satan did yeah even though his was the law was thinking he says my thoughts are gonna be above god's thoughts my throne's gonna be about i'm gonna do my will and that's how he tries to get us to work every day second corinthians chapter 10 verse 5 casting down imaginations every high thing that exalteth itself notice exalted itself we're either exalting christ or exalting ourself and every high thing that exalteth itself against look the knowledge of god and bringing into captivity every thought to the obedience of christ when god speaks god expects obedience if we don't believe in that part of the gospel then we have lost we don't even need church honestly because this is where we come and hear the living word speaking to us personally in other words we should every one of us should be able to walk out of church every time we come to church and say god spoke to me this i heard from god it may be one thing it may be a dozen things but you've got to hear from god when you come to church if that's not happening something's wrong with you amen not god god don't waste your time god would never call you here and purposely not speak to you when you made a sacrifice to come brother branham says god wants to give us the holy ghost more than we can imagine talking about all that pressure on the bottom of a pipe don't you think he wants to reveal himself to you and tell you what you need we need the mind of christ it's not a gift we got to spend time seeking and humbling ourselves cast down the imaginations that exalt itself against the knowledge of god and we'll know that by trying the spirit we know the obvious ones the obvious ones when they pop up on your phone you know the obvious ones commercials on tv the obvious ones i'm talking about the ones that i wonder try it try the spirit god's way of thinking is extremely humble in fact he's hiding in humility and simplicity they're they're right there they're like hand and glove here's the way that god wants us to think let this mind be in you that was also in christ jesus philippians chapter four verse eight finally brethren whatsoever things are true well that is why i listened to fox news in the cities nbc the only you know the thing is i you must pass the test of all these words what sort of things are true whatsoever things are honest whatsoever things are just right whatsoever things are pure you know you hear a good story on the news or you're watching a movie and it turns out real good it's just something good about a good report right what sort of things are peer whatsoever things are lovely whatsoever things are of a good report i want to tell you these are god's high thoughts these are god's high thoughts these are not thoughts that god wants you to think and he's thinking something different this is the mind of god if there's any strength or virtue if there's any praise spend time thinking about it amen amen i want to say are you passing have you been passing the gospel test with your thoughts are you thinking on things that are pure and lovely and of a good report are you thinking of things that are just righteous pure and holy these are the higher thoughts of god well brother john you don't know what i'm going through and it's just it's just a monster of a situation and this and i just i think on these things right right period there's there's no exception because it's satan trying to give you some more bad news if he can get you thinking about how bad things are he'll keep you down here hopeless we need to walk with the mind of christ the bride knows where she stands she's got a word for the devil it's the word of god it's get behind me satan this is what i'm following this is what i'm going to think about but don't you realize you're going to die i'm going to think on these things amen i'll tell you it may not change the outcome of my situation but i want to have a testimony before god i want about a stand before him one day and say i did what your word told me to do not try to be einstein try to figure out well if i do this is it going to make a difference got to cast that down every one of us is guilty every one of us is standing there with accusers right and they all brought us to jesus i thought he was i thought she was a christian i thought right yes accuser of the brethren amen but jesus is standing in your behalf says i know the thoughts i think towards you saith the lord thoughts of i want to give you an expected end go and sin no more he's given us an opportunity amen the correct way of thinking the absolute intelligence the word of god amen amen if the things that you're thinking don't move you to give god praise and worship stop thinking about it amen if it don't make you want to just praise god stop thinking well john is real the world's coming to i know it but praise god he inhabits the praises of his people well i can't praise him until that's like saying i can't pay my tithes until i can't follow the word until i can't i can't love that person until they make it right no you can because christ and you can do all things amen verse nine these things which you have both learned and received and heard and seen in me just do them would you do it do it nike do it and the god of peace shall be with you walking with god amen this is how god thinks paul writing this he knew he had to give up everything when your thoughts are stayed on the lord stayed on the word he promised to keep you in perfect peace i'll say it like this the mind of god is not going to be a gift to you this message is so much more important than you realize you have to activate your free more agency to make a decision on what you're going to think about and if you choose to keep your mind on the right things you will be walking with the mind of christ it's that simple doesn't matter how long you've been in the message doesn't matter if you're a christian it matters that you do what you need to do to get the results that you need because if you always done what you always did you're always going to get what you always got it's powerful to change the way that you think yeah for the better for the better if you're if you're if you're on cloud nine and you're winning souls and you're happy you you can't wait till the doors are open and all those positive things are going to i say stay the course but it ain't happening change the way you're thinking you're listening too much bad news listen to the devil too much we need to walk in this hour with the mind of christ amen let's stand together god wants us walking with the mind of christ amen praise the lord amen let's go before the lord in prayer amen let's just close our eyes for a moment bow our head and maybe there's something on your your heart that you're desiring lift that before the lord god sees your heart and desire for him to come and just meet that need brother brandon talked about the effectual fervent prayer or i'm sorry he said that the right mental attitude will bring any divine promise of god to pass god honors the right way of thinking i want us just to turn off all the negative thoughts all the judgmental thoughts all the selfish thoughts all the thoughts i'm going to do things my way just humble yourself before the lord today and my my reason is because i really want god to exalt you in due time to lift you up into heavenly places i know if we do our part god promised to do his amen let's believe as we pray together our gracious heavenly father so glad i'm yours lord so glad i'm yours so glad your mercy has followed us today lord all the times that we could look back and that you've judged us for a wrong doing there is mercy mercy with those judgments lord because your high thoughts are that none would perish that

hard time praising me but he's doing it i just believe the lord looks on that sacrifice is a great sacrifice pleasing to him and he just wants to come and help us more because we've humbled herself
