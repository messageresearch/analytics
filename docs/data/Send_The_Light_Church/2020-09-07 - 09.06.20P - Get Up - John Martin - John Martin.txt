TRANSCRIPT
========================================
uh for a couple opening scriptures here the first one's going to be in psalms chapter 37 and verse 23 verse 24. we want to minister and the message getting up amen we actually need to get get up and follow our example amen amen we'll read these scriptures and then we'll have a word of prayer psalms chapter 37 starting with verse 23 and 24 the steps of a good man are ordered by the lord and he delighteth in his way though he fall he shall not be utterly cast down for the lord upholdeth him with his hand what a precious promise amen amen and then proverbs chapter 24 verse number 16. for a just i'm sorry you're some some of you are still turning it's so beautiful to hear the pages going proverbs chapter 24 verse 16 for a just man falleth not just once but seven times and riseth up again but the wicked shall fall into mischief amen let's bow in a word of prayer heavenly father we thank you for your precious word and these words are encouraging to us today lord knowing that none of us were are perfect and we found our ourselves following not just once or twice but many times we think about the words of your prophet that said we we even backslide 100 times a day it's in our thoughts lord just coming short of your glory and what you really desire and expect of us and today lord we're thankful that you lift us up and hold us up and reach down and grab us to get back up again lord i pray for every believer here today everyone in the sound of my voice lord no matter what their situation is no matter how they feel lord may they know that they do stan have within them the strength to get back up lord to keep walking in the direction that you've called us lord it's a hard walk it's not for the faint in heart for sure lord but you've called us to perfection and i pray that you bless us now lord as we gather around your word and you come and lift us up into heavenly places we'll give you the glory for these things lord for we humbly ask it in jesus christ's name amen amen god bless you may be seated well god is the giver of life amen he's the author and the creator of our life the fact that we were approximately one out of a million people that were born right amen that he chose you one out of a million it's something to think about god chose you and he chose to give you life and then he turns right back around and he places within you a choice what you want to do with that life you can give that life back to god as your creator recognizing where you came from or you can make the choice to selfishly use it for yourself as if there you weren't created by god those are the choices amen joshua one time stood up before a nation of people and said in joshua chapter 24 versus verse 15 and if it seemed evil unto you to serve the lord a lot of people it seems evil choose you this day whom you will serve whether the gods which your father served that were on the other side of the flood or the gods of their amorites in whose land you dwell but as for me in in my house i am making a choice we will serve the lord amen today we stand facing the same choice today it's not only a choice that we make when we first come to the lord to choose to to follow him but it is a choice that we have to make every single day of our lives now we're stuck inside this selfish flesh this is selfish i am just as my flesh is just as selfish as yours flesh is flesh that's why we need to follow the word that jesus spoke the example that he set for to to die daily to that thing so christ can live in us paul never said i'm not dead never said uh jesus died for me i don't got to do anything so we got to follow that example right amen we're not going to preach this morning's message but when we don't fully die we end up falling from our old stenfastness into traps that the enemy has set for us and right there we have to make a choice again and it's just as critical as the choice we made when we first surrendered our life to jesus christ amen it's a choice to get up and serve the lord amen it doesn't become less important it's just as important because jesus said he that endure to the end he shall be saved right amen so we have to keep getting up and enduring to the end for a just man follows seven times and riseth up again but the wicked shall fall into mischief amen a just man a righteous man a man of faith the bible says the just shall live by faith they they have a revelation and yet he can fall seven times [Music] it's important to see how valuable our choices are it's not up to somebody else to pick us up if that's true then i'm just not going to do nothing i'm going to make everybody help me it's not the right spirit it's not the right attitude the bible says every man shall bear his own burden now the difference between the just and the unjust is simply the wicked do not get back up they have chosen to stay down when they fall in their own mischief we all fall into mischief we all make mistakes we all make wrong choices we all get spiritually lazy we all fall in doing our own will and judging others and not esteeming others better than ourselves we've all failed to represent christ properly we can all get more concerned about our own reputation than the reputation of christ we can all fall into our own purpose and plans and forgetting his and really the value of a soul we can all fall into strife and drama and debating hateful and ill thoughts not wanting to wash not willing to wash somebody else's feet no more the difference between the just and the unjust is simply the just get back up from their condition [Music] well the unjust don't mind living in that condition they get used to it but the just shall live by faith they get back up because they're believers and when they fall seven times in a row all seven times they get back up we all can be just today all we gotta do is get back up amen don't gotta be perfect just get back up maybe that's why peter asked if for giving someone to jesus he said do i just forgive somebody seven times maybe he found this scripture in the bible i don't know but we know seven times is not enough to forgive somebody yes amen in the mind of god there is no number that he's put on forgiving you none amen how many times has jesus forgiven you since you came to him amen i wonder why it was the oldest that began to to to leave first when he asked he that's without sin moses was a murderer and all of god's people down through the ages have fallen and had to get back up amen moses was a murderer and yet god used him to change the world to turn the world as the world upside down brother brown said amen he had a a major problem of feeling inadequate anybody can anybody relate to that oh yeah he was not a very good speaker anybody can relate to that oh yeah yet god chose him to advance god's kingdom the children of israel they murmured and complained all the way yes right yet god had a seed in the midst of that amen why cries unto me he said to moses speak unto the children of israel that they go forward yes in other words get up from your situation and move forward don't stay in that condition the christian armor does not have anything for its back there's no retreat go forward amen i know it looks like it could be bleak but go forward amen moses struck the rock twice we should never crucify christ again amen but god didn't throw moses away moses got back up and he served the lord he continued to lead the children of israel towards the promised land to get up and serve the lord again for he was a just man amen he was a righteous man even though he fell he didn't he didn't follow he let the anger get beside him and he said something he shouldn't have said he did something he shouldn't did but yet he got back up he repented and he moved forward did you know 80 of the ministry during the time of moses spearheaded wasn't willing to suffer 80 percent of the ministry of his in his hour they didn't want to lay down their lives they didn't believe it was necessary to lay down their lives to go over they said we'll serve the lord on this side you're right right you don't have to do that because those are giants over there it's hard to give up your will it's terrible that's scary these were 80 of the message believers in that hour here we see joshua and caleb they had to suffer an extra 40 years just because of the attitude of the majority of the message believers amen they didn't cop the same attitude they have whoa it's not fair you know we should have to suffer 40 extra years because of them no sir they got up and they went to church and they served the lord every day he said we're more than able to take the promised land they maintain the right mental attitude all the way through yes there's a negative attitude in the church i know that god knows that amen that doesn't mean we change ours god's calling the elect to act like they're elect joshua and caleb were of another spirit amen they couldn't murmur and complain there was something different about them they had the holy ghost that's what made them get up continue to serve the lord amen joshua chapter 14 verse 10 caleb said and now behold the lord have kept me alive as he said these 40 you know i was thinking i'm not going to like read any scriptures you know i'm going to give this message to just tell stories and i just can't do it i try so hard i love the word and he said these 40 and five years even since the lord spake his word unto moses while the children of israel wandered in the wilderness and now lo i am this day 85 years old as as yet i am as strong this day as it was in the day of that moses sent me as my strength was then even so is my strength now for war both to go out and to come in now therefore give me this mountain amen whereof the lord spake in that day for thou heardest in that day how the amakites were then and that the cities were great and fans for if so be the lord will be with me then i shall be able to drive them out as the lord said and joshua blessed him and gave unto caleb the son of genoa to noah uh inheritance see it's going to be easy for the saints in heaven to remember my name to call my name but i'm trying to have a hard time with all these names in the old testament think about it his attitude was just the same his inner strength was just the same you're right amen and now he waited 45 years not because he failed because he was part of a body yes that's why the strong needs bear the infirmities of the weak amen so we need to stand in the gap it's easy to call out people's problems but who's going to stay in there and wash their feet do you know it's love that covers a multitude of sin amen joshua chapter 1 verse 3 what a beautiful attitude joshua has no we hear god speaking every place that the soul of your feet shall tread upon that have i given you as i said unto moses in other words get up and keep walking amen and where you walk it's yours what you claim is yours what you say i'm going through is yours would you say i can't i'm afraid it's not yours it's not for you it's for the believer verse 5 then shall not there shall not be any man be able to stand before thee all the days of thy life as i was with moses so i be with thee i would not fail thee nor for safety what a precious promise you know that is to every one of us yes now the devil is going to try to stand in your life and he's going to use a lot of situations but you got to just take a stand you got to believe greater is he that's in me than he that's in the world verse six be strong be of good courage for unto this people shall thou divide for inheritance the land which i swear unto their fathers to give them only be thou strong and very courageous that thou mayest observe to do accordingly to all that all the law which moses my servant commanded thee turn not from it to the right hand or to the left that thou mayest prosper whether so ever thou goest get up and keep observing to do the word yes if i could say it like this get up and follow the example get up and follow the example verse 8 this book of the law shall not depart out of thy mouth but thou shalt meditate therein day and night amen that thou mayest observe to do all that is written therein notice the purpose of reading the book the purpose in reading the book is so you can obey it if there's another reason get away from it for then thou shall make thy way prosperous and then thou shall have good success have not i commanded thee get up and be strong and be of good courage be not afraid neither be thou dismayed for the lord thy god is with you whethers whoever thou goes that's good enough for me i mean you know when you're down and the person that's looking at you is up here and you're down there and it doesn't look like you got a friend it's hard to get up right but if you can visualize that jesus said i'll never leave you i'll never forsake you right he's there reaching like this just grab his hand he'll help you up amen he'll get you up back where you need to be amen elijah was a mighty prophet he faced 400 prophets one time and these prophets they believed the same word there was just one little thing that was missing in their ministry and he was able to face all of them men with the word of god united in one accord just wasn't god's cord and because they left out part of the word and yet we find him running from just one woman who wasn't a prophet he didn't have the word she believed in makeup it's awful quiet i didn't mean that in any negative way but look god made this perfect amen amen amen i know we can make ourselves better i i understand that but if i went to do something it's like telling god i didn't like what you did i didn't want to say anything like that that just came amen but yet he was feeling all alone he ran from her and he fell all alone that there was no one with him he was left all alone after he destroyed those prophets and in first kings chapter 19 verse 11 let's pick it up there and god said get up elijah go forth and stand unto the mountain before the lord and behold the lord pass by in a great strong wind rent the mountains and break into pieces the rocks before the lord and the lord was not in the wind after the wind and earthquake but the lord was not an earthquake and after the earthquake of fire but the lord was not in the fire amen and after the fire there's a still small voice and it was so when elijah heard it that he wrapped his face in his mantle went out and stood in the entrance of the cave and behold there came a voice onto him and said what are you doing here yes sir that's right what is going on elijah you know oftentimes we find ourselves sitting around moping about our current situation god said get up there's 7 000 others that have not bowed their knee to their own will right amen amen it's time for us to get up saints there's still souls to be rescued there's souls to be saved there's a light to send out to others i don't know if there's 7 700 or seven but we need to be about our father's business and we need to get up and and do our job that's what god told elijah yes yes sir jonah i want you to go preach to nineveh they need to repent of their sins and and turn towards me well jonah didn't really want to try to help nineveh like a lot of us who are content with just knowing god ourselves not too interested in helping others so he just runs to do his own will do his own thing and where did it lead him it led him to the end of the road of his road i mean he was he was in a pickle god got him in a condition they had to really think about the choices that he was making right now he didn't force him but he put him in a position to look at his choice that he made and he prayed he turned his his his uh his heart towards the lord and he repented let's pick it up from his selfish nature jonah chapter two verse one jonah chapter two verse one then jonah prayed unto the lord his god out of the fish's belly now we might say then john prayed unto the lord his god out of his fishy situation amen and said i cried by the reason of my afflictions unto the lord and he heard me out of the belly of hell yes sir cried i that and thou heard us my voice for thou hat for thou hast cast me into the deep into the midst of the sea and the floods come pass me about all thy billows and thy ways pass me over notice he is he was actually saying the footsteps of the righteous are ordered of the lord that's what he's saying here the lord orchestrated everything then i said i am cast out of thy sight yet i will look again toward thy holy temple the waters can pass me about even to my soul the death close me round about and the weeds were wrapped around my head and i went down to the bottoms of the mountains the earth with her bars were about me forever yet has thou brought up my life from corruption o lord my god yes and when my soul fainted within me i remembered the lord that's all we got to do remember the lord and get back up and my prayer came in unto thee into thy holy temple it started in the midst of a dark ugly situation but it it weeded through all the seaweed and all the vomit and the skin of the fish and it went directly to god's temple we don't got to be a church we just got to have church in our hearts he said they that observe lying vanities forsake their own mercies that's exactly what happened to the children of israel when they went spied out the land they were looking at lion vanities and they forsook their own mercies but praise god we're gentiles god deals with us as individuals and we can have a different spirit when we look at our situation we can get the holy ghost we can be overcomers when we just get up amen but i will sacrifice unto thee the voice of thanksgiving i will pay that i have vowed amen salvation is of the lord yes and the lord spake unto jonah's situation and it vomited out jonah upon dry land amen you know what jonah did he literally got up and he went and did exactly what god had told her to do the first time for a just man falls seven times and it riseth up again and do what god's called him to do don't look at the fall don't look at the mistakes don't count how many times just get up and do it again keep marching forward notice in jonah chapter one verse two jonah chapter one verse two god says arise go to nineveh that great city that that and cry against it for the wickedness has come up before me now notice two chapters later i just want to start with in chapter three verse one and the word of the lord coming to john and the second time sin arise go to nineveh that great city and preach unto it onto it the preaching that i baby in other words we can forget what god spoke to us before but god hasn't forgotten amen you can go through many trials and many situations and many things but god will bring you right back amen if god has asked you to do something see to it that you do it amen don't put it off so jonah arose in verse 3 and went to nineveh according to the word of the lord now nineveh was exceeding great city amen the king james version said oh it says arise as we read it arise but the new living translation the christian standard bible and many other versions use the word get up which was nice because i was three quarters of the way in this message when i read that that was exciting to me and not only that i walked out two times and showed brother marty songs i had written down to sing at the end of the service that brother ron had already picked i had to cross that off the list cross that off the list i say church get up amen it's time for us to go into all the world amen and preach the gospel make as brother brandon said make converts to jesus christ get up and be wise and be about the father's business get up and go baptize people in the name of jesus christ teaching them to observe all things whatsoever i've commanded you and lo and with you just as he is with joshua he's with us too amen we just got to do what he told us to do to observe to do all that's according to the law don't make this gospel your personal gospel come into the gospel the word and get dressed with the whole word satan wants us to cherry-pick things call it christianity that's not true christianity that's what peter tried doing end up following jesus from afar believe in them but i kind of you know certain things i do certain things i don't right i mean the ministry at the church you know it's good you know i go but i'm not into it peter always wanted to lead the pack lord if that you walking on the water bid me to come well peter jumps out of the boat after jesus said come he jumped out with both feet got got right there started walking on the water he stepped out by faith and god honored it amen and when we began when he began to look at the situation how difficult and what could possibly happen wasn't happening but what could possibly happen in his situation he began to doubt that god was going to take him through amen as soon as he began to doubt he began to sink yes sir but praise god he called out jesus lord save me amen and jesus just reached down amen [Applause] i've trained you better than that i gave you faith to cast out demons oh ye of little faith it's easy to pray for somebody else it's hard to have that same faith for yourself amen the bible says and when when they come into the ship the wind it cease and that that when they were all on the ship they worshipped and saying all the truth thou art the son of god i'll tell you today we're in the safe haven of god's holy spirit it should be no problem as brother ron said to worship the lord in spirit and in truth amen peter wanted to prove he was the greatest of the disciples he wanted to fight for jesus to the very end but as we know he denied the lord three times i could just see jesus looking over from the cross and whispering get up peter when thou art converted strengthen thy brethren see jesus knew it was going to happen just like jesus knew every time you fell what's going to happen get up get up be be righteous be just and get up don't judge yourself as unrighteous because of what you've done if you stay down that's wrong that's what makes you unrighteous so it makes you unjust it's what makes us wicked yes we got to stand up for jesus get back up amen that's what makes you righteous right there the fact that you get up from your situation says you are a believer yes you're a defined gravity you define the devil's wishes and you're identifying yourself in this bible that says you're a righteous man if you get back up that's where i want to be identified failure doesn't disqualify you staying down disqualifies you so get out amen god doesn't call the qualified he qualifies those that he's called amen now get up and let him qualify you in other words finish the race that he started has he called you to this place or has he caught you to perfection amen the other day brother mark came over and he had a little his little costco card so i thought i'd play a little joke and i put it on and i just start talking i just got home from work you know a lot of times we want the badge i'm in the message i've attained i'm there this is all there is for me and they're not reaching for anything right what is your goal get up from your situation and reach forth for what's in front of you what you don't have yet well it's been 45 years talk to joshua talk to caleb go get your mountain that's right it's time to get up and run the race with patience simon do you love me more than anyone so jesus asked him yea lord thou knowest that i love us the female lambs he said simon senator jonas now loves me you know lord will feed my sheep simon do you really love me the bible says peter was grieved at the word because he heard it three times i wonder how many was grieved this morning hearing it three times brother john it wasn't three thousand thirty three times he was grieved that the word but peter said thou knowest all you know that i love thee right and jesus said then get up and feed my sheep amen we need to get up it's one thing just to say i love you lord i love you lord do you love god enough to get up and do his will one time a woman was caught in adultery the very act the bible says and jesus asked when he went through the situation woman where's your accusers and she said there are none lord i don't have any and these wonderful words that jesus spoke neither do i now get up and go sin no more right amen that's right humanity it don't matter the situation am i it matters the direction god's grace is here to meet every need yes amen notice the word had to deal with everyone else's conscience first before he dealt with herself you know sometimes you can be around a bunch of judgmental people that's true yeah just judge you right and we all got enough to be judged amen right thank god we have someone that took our judgment amen you notice these people that are around judging you as if they're a little higher than you they're a little better as if they don't have anything to be judged amen it's sad you know the bible says that we shouldn't sit in the seat of the scornful right we need to get up amen we need to get up off that seat amen get off the seat of judgment and go washed the disciples feet amen don't wash somebody's feet amen get them clean then you won't be pointing a finger at them i don't want to do that's not my job they should know better i've told them so many times okay explain to me what spirit that is explain that to me well that's the gospel according to john martin who wants to what it wants to listen to that gospel who's going to follow that gospel that gospel ain't going to save anybody amen only the gospel of jesus christ amen the disciples fell asleep three times during a very important prayer meeting how many times you hear jesus ask his disciples would you come and pray with me to come and watch and even asked him what could you not watch and pray with me one hour just one hour so i asked of you i've done so much for you peter ended up following jesus from afar because remember jesus said pray that you don't fall into temptation oh i got it covered i got it covered you know i'm real close to jesus well just wait to you know they don't want to enter into temptation we need to get up and follow our example i know it's hard to pray exactly all the times that we probably need to pray but we need to spend more time in prayer amen prayer makes us more spiritual prayer makes us less carnal prayer opens a door to hearing the same word but the correct meaning amen amen one time he said children have you any meat they said no he says well get up and cast your net on the right side of the ship a yes of times we find ourselves doing things that is not bringing forth fruit right just get up just get up from your situation don't don't keep fishing on the same side i mean more likely if anybody's ever done any fishing if you're not catching something you usually put a different lure on or you get up like brother mike he'll travel to another another lake god wants us to bear fruit amen their fruit would remain one time a couple of jesus's disciples were walking to him on the road to emmaus and they were talking about all the bad things that had just happened amen jesus drew near to them but jesus hid himself from from their presence from from knowing who he was and you know a lot of times i believe jesus is right in our midst and we don't even realize it he's usually veiled behind some humanity and he said to them what manner of communications are these that you have with that you have one with another as you walk and are sad and they started to tell jesus all their woes all their problems and finally had enough of their negativity and you know what he said to them come on boys everything's going to be okay i'm here now no he called his own disciples fools he said old fools and slow to heart to believe all that the prophets had spoken now notice what they left out ought not christ to have suffered these things and to enter his glory we want to leave out the suffering he wanted them to get up and follow the example amen hebrews chapter 2 verse 10 for it became him for whom are all things and by whom are all things in bringing many sons unto glory to make the captain of their salvation perfect through sufferings i want to talk about the person that you want to christ i want to ask you did you win that person without suffering [Music] you had to give up your time you had to lay down your own reputation for christ you had to represent him to truly represent him it's not like being these politicians right we need to get up follow our example amen when god called abraham to leave his family he didn't fully realize the suffering that awaited him and i'm telling you when i first started that story i and just imagine god called abraham i'm going to make you a father of many nations just leave your family forsake all come follow me and it's going to happen wow he wasn't even able to go into the promised land and you had to wait how many years to have a son why didn't god say all that at the beginning why didn't god tell me i'd be stuck in this church brother ron listen to this old john martin again you know god has many things he'd like to tell us but we can't bear it right now but by faith it took abe abraham took god at his word not knowing where he was going but by faith he took god at his word and he just followed it was led by the spirit of god amen he couldn't tell anybody he couldn't even tell his family where he was going because god didn't tell him no man knows the day or the hour but jesus is coming soon amen amen you're going to be a father of many nations and sarah is going to have a son but many years went by and sarah still didn't have their son right right so abraham tried doing things his way and it caused a lot of trouble you know the story he got so caught up in the flesh with ishmael having ishmael being the promised son that when god reminded abraham of his promise that abraham said o lord that that ishmael right would live that he would be the promise isn't that sad that's how far he had gotten from the original promise but you know what abraham got up he told abraham get out i said sarah is going to have a son about this time next year and even in her old age god still promised and he kept his promise for a just man falls seven times and he riseth up again but the wicked shall fall into mischief abraham got up because he believed the just shall live by faith when you read the story let's go to the romans chapter four when you read the story in the new testament you don't hear of the falls of abraham just so you know your story is being written in heaven just put it under the blood and it won't be in yours either romans chapter 4 verse 18 who against hope believed in hope that he might become the father of many nations according to that which was spoken so shall thy seed be and being not weak in faith he went all that time and he just he didn't say you know it's been so many years i just give up on this christianity thing this this this thing called the message when he's supposed to be coming already not being weak in faith he considered not his own understanding his own body now being dead when he was about a hundred years old neither yet the deadness of sarah's womb he staggered not at the promises of god through unbelief but he was strong in faith giving glory to god and being fully persuaded he got back up amen what he had promised he was able to perform don't stay down when you fail and i don't care how miserable it is get up god has a promise for you amen well look at the mess i caused we're still dealing with it i was thinking you know when god promised i'm going to make you a father of many nations i was thinking there was really there's only one nation that was important that was israel and the spiritual seed of israel all the other nations were just fighting against one another all right yeah that's right right it's good we're a a royal priesthood we're a holy nation it's the seed of god that's important amen hebrews chapter 10 verse 35 cast not away therefore your confidence don't stay down when you fall amen get up cast down away therefore your confidence which have great recompense of reward for you of need of patience that after you have done the will of god you might receive the promise for yet a little while and he that shall come will come and will not tarry now the just shall live by faith but if any man draw back just draw back my soul shall have no pleasure in him amen but we are not of them who draw back unto perdition but we are them that believe to the saving of the soul yes we're none of them that draw back into laodicea right into apostasy into some form of godliness to just saying i'm in the message no where are them that get up and believe in moving forward amen where are them that get up and go on to perfection where are them that get up and lay everything aside and go get perfect love that's what the prophet said get up lay everything else aside that you're in and go get perfect love though he slay me yet well i get up because i trust him right no matter what happens to you get up amen trust the lord let your story be told let it be said of you i got up because he chose me amen let it be written of you i got up you'll be just like everybody else in the book of hebrews chapter 11 you'll be like every other person every prophet you'll be just like uh uh uh not only abraham but but paul if you just get up that puts you in the same level i don't care how many times you fall get up let's stand together
