[39:25] of all um luke chapter 14.
[39:34] luke chapter 4 chapter 4 i'm sorry
[39:38] look yes luke chapter 4
[39:42] we are reading verse
[39:45] 16.
[39:49] luke chapter 4 and also read
[39:52] acts chapter 3
[39:55] verse 1 to 9.
[39:57] but first of all we are tackling luke
[40:00] chapter 4 verse 16.
[40:04] and he came to nazareth
[40:07] where he had been brought up
[40:09] and as
[40:10] his customers
[40:12] he went into the synagogue on the
[40:14] sabbath day
[40:16] and stood up for to read
[40:19] and there was delivered unto him the
[40:20] book of the prophet isaiah
[40:23] or isaiah
[40:25] and when
[40:26] he had opened the book
[40:31] of the prophet isaiah
[40:33] and when he had opened the book he found
[40:35] the place where it was written
[40:37] the spirit of the lord is upon me
[40:40] because he had anointed me to preach the
[40:43] gospel to the poor
[40:46] he had sent me to heal the brokenhearted
[40:50] to preach deliverance
[40:52] to the captives
[40:54] and recovering of sight to the blind
[40:57] to set a liberty
[40:59] them that are bruised
[41:01] to preach the acceptable year
[41:04] of the lord
[41:06] and he closed the book and he gave it
[41:08] again to the minister and sat down
[41:11] and the eyes of all them that were in
[41:13] the synagogue were fasting on him
[41:16] and he began to say unto them
[41:19] this day is this scripture fulfill
[41:22] in your ears
[41:23] and all bear him witness
[41:26] and wonder are the gracious words which
[41:28] proceeded out of his mouth
[41:30] and he said
[41:31] it's not this joseph
[41:35] let me take it again please and they
[41:37] said
[41:38] is not this joseph's son
[41:42] acts chapter
[41:43] 3
[41:47] and verse one to nine
[41:51] now peter and john went up together into
[41:53] the temple at the hour of prayer being
[41:55] the ninth hour and certain man limb from
[41:57] his mother's womb was carried whom they
[42:00] laid daily at the gates of the temple
[42:03] which is called beautiful to ask arms of
[42:06] them that entered into the temple
[42:09] who seen peter and john about to go into
[42:11] the temple as an arm
[42:13] and peter fastened his eyes upon him
[42:15] with john said look on us
[42:19] and he gave it unto them expecting to
[42:21] receive something of them
[42:22] then peter said silver and gold have i
[42:25] known the such as i have give iv
[42:28] in the name of jesus christ of nazareth
[42:31] rise up and walk
[42:33] and he took him by the right hand and
[42:35] lifted him up and immediately his feet
[42:38] and ankle bones received strength
[42:42] and he limping up stood and walked and
[42:44] entered with them into the temple
[42:47] walking and limping and praising god and
[42:50] all the people saw him walking and
[42:53] praising god amen the lord had his
[42:55] blessing to the reading of his word amen
[42:58] please let's take our seed
[43:01] well
[43:03] tonight
[43:04] we want to look on this topic look on
[43:07] jesus
[43:11] look on jesus
[43:12] and now i believe strongly
[43:16] that our sons and daughters of god
[43:18] the only one
[43:20] we ought to look on is jesus
[43:25] there is no other one there is no other
[43:27] person
[43:29] we cannot look to ourselves
[43:32] we cannot look to any person
[43:36] any human being in our society or our
[43:39] environment
[43:41] we cannot look onto that person
[43:44] but jesus christ
[43:46] he is the only one that we should
[43:49] focus
[43:51] and look upon him
[43:53] because
[43:54] he is such
[43:56] that when people look on him
[44:00] they have their own ideas
[44:04] many people look on
[44:06] jesus and they don't see him to be god
[44:12] many people look on jesus and they think
[44:14] that
[44:16] he's just a religious leader a leader
[44:21] many people look on jesus especially
[44:24] like the pharisees at that time
[44:27] like the bible just said when he
[44:30] told them that this day this scripture
[44:32] is fulfilled they say is it not yourself
[44:34] son
[44:36] so they were looking on him
[44:39] as joseph's son amen
[44:42] hallelujah
[44:44] some look on jesus
[44:46] and they think that
[44:48] he was
[44:49] an illegitimate child
[44:53] but tonight we want to ask ourselves
[44:55] questions
[44:56] that when we look on jesus who do we see
[45:03] hallelujah
[45:05] so you see human beings have reached a
[45:07] position that
[45:09] every place there is confusion
[45:13] confusion everywhere
[45:16] and when you are in that state
[45:20] you don't have a stable mind
[45:24] so
[45:25] if we look on jesus and we cannot know
[45:27] who he is then that means there's
[45:29] confusion in our minds
[45:35] for example you got up in the morning or
[45:37] in the afternoon whatever in the evening
[45:40] you feel hungry but john you want to go
[45:42] and eat and you don't know what food to
[45:44] eat
[45:46] you don't know whether you should go for
[45:47] pizza
[45:49] or hamburger
[45:52] or chimichanga
[45:54] you are totally confused
[45:56] sometimes your appetite crave for all
[45:59] these
[46:01] and you cannot take all at once
[46:04] so therefore your your mind is going to
[46:06] shift from here to until you finally
[46:09] make your decision
[46:12] it means there is little confusion in
[46:14] your mind
[46:15] hallelujah
[46:17] but these people that jesus christ that
[46:19] day entered into the synagogue and the
[46:22] bible said that the book of isaiah was
[46:24] handed over to him
[46:26] to read amen
[46:28] it was a day that scripture was going to
[46:31] be fulfilled
[46:33] and beloved you agree with me that when
[46:36] god is fulfilling his scriptures he
[46:38] doesn't need anybody's advice
[46:42] he doesn't need anybody to get ready or
[46:45] not
[46:46] when the time comes for him to fulfill
[46:48] his word he fulfills it
[46:52] no matter how the people look on jesus
[46:54] christ
[46:55] no matter how they considered him to be
[46:57] that day
[46:59] a person that they were calling him an
[47:01] illegitimate child
[47:03] now we asked ourselves a question that
[47:06] why did they
[47:08] 100 the scroll to him to read
[47:13] because
[47:14] he was somebody that they did not
[47:16] respect
[47:18] he was somebody that the pharisees
[47:21] have ganked against him amen
[47:24] until you have told your members that
[47:26] nobody should even go and listen to him
[47:29] but that day
[47:31] in their midst
[47:32] they gave the book to him to read
[47:36] now after he read
[47:38] the scripture
[47:40] of isaiah chapter 61
[47:44] the bible said that he gave the
[47:46] scroll back to the minister
[47:49] and all the people were looking on him
[47:52] now like how all of you are looking on
[47:54] me right now
[47:56] and he told them
[47:58] this day
[48:00] this scripture
[48:01] is fulfilled
[48:05] but they said
[48:09] and obey him witness
[48:12] and wanted at the gracious west which
[48:14] proceeded out of his mouth
[48:18] and they said it's not this joseph's son
[48:25] meaning
[48:27] they don't believe
[48:28] that he should be the one to proclaim
[48:31] that
[48:34] they look on him but they didn't see
[48:36] that he was a scripture who should come
[48:39] to fulfill that scripture
[48:42] they were looking on him and they saw
[48:44] him as joseph's son
[48:47] oh praise be the name of our god
[48:50] but whether they believe it or not a
[48:52] faithful scripture fulfilled that day
[48:56] he said d-day whether you believe it or
[48:58] not the scripture is fulfilled in your
[49:01] years
[49:04] and the bible says that they were so mad
[49:08] they gang up
[49:10] they held him
[49:12] they wanted to throw him into a ditch
[49:15] but by the power of god
[49:18] he passed through them and he went away
[49:21] this was a man
[49:23] who was born as a man
[49:26] but her no father has no
[49:28] mother
[49:30] according to the revelation that we have
[49:34] because we know that a woman cannot
[49:36] because
[49:37] uh you know take consumption without
[49:39] knowing the man
[49:41] and so the holy ghost said that mary
[49:43] what is in your womb is by the holy
[49:45] spirit
[49:46] [Music]
[49:48] until joseph himself the bible said that
[49:50] because he was afraid he wanted to leave
[49:52] that woman secretly and the holy ghost
[49:54] spoke to him he said joseph be not
[49:56] afraid to take that woman unto you but
[49:59] what is in her womb
[50:01] is by the holy spirit
[50:04] and so it was between god and mary
[50:10] he know that jesus christ was
[50:12] extraordinary born
[50:15] it was not a normal it was supernatural
[50:17] breath amen
[50:19] but yet
[50:20] the jews didn't see the quality that was
[50:23] in jesus
[50:24] christ they still saw him as joseph's
[50:27] son
[50:29] and after all this he left the scene
[50:32] that one day
[50:34] after they tried to throw him in the
[50:36] ditch and all that
[50:38] but there was a woman
[50:41] when he went to
[50:43] um
[50:45] samaria
[50:46] with his disciple one day
[50:49] and according to the bible accounts
[50:52] the disciples went to town to go and buy
[50:54] bread yes amen
[50:57] and so jesus christ was left alone
[50:59] seated by a world
[51:02] and a woman came around to fetch
[51:04] or to draw water
[51:06] then jesus said woman will you give me
[51:09] drink
[51:14] and the woman said well
[51:16] i am a samaritan and you are a jew
[51:19] we have nothing in
[51:20] common why then you asked me to give you
[51:24] water to drink
[51:26] then jesus said woman
[51:29] if you know the gift of god
[51:33] and the one that is standing before you
[51:37] you rather ask me of water
[51:39] and i'll give you water and you'll not
[51:40] come here again to draw
[51:44] hallelujah
[51:45] that beat the woman's mind that
[51:47] imagination is a what
[51:49] what kind of water are you going to give
[51:50] to me
[51:53] hallelujah let's read a little of that
[51:55] conversation
[51:56] um
[51:59] i think it's john chapter 4 yes
[52:08] okay john chapter 4
[52:14] yes let me continue from the verse 10.
[52:16] he said jesus answered and said unto her
[52:18] if thou know was the gift of god
[52:21] and who is it that said to thee give me
[52:24] to drink
[52:25] thou with us have asked of me
[52:29] and he will have given me living water
[52:32] the woman said unto him say
[52:35] thou
[52:36] house
[52:37] he said thou has nothing to draw with
[52:40] and the world is deep
[52:42] from whence then has that living water
[52:46] are thou greater than our father jacob
[52:49] would give us the wealth
[52:51] and drunk thereof himself and his
[52:53] children and his cattle
[52:56] jesus answered and said unto her
[52:59] whosoever drinketh of this water shall
[53:01] test again
[53:02] but whosoever drinketh of the water that
[53:05] i shall give him shall never test
[53:08] but the water that i shall give him
[53:10] shall be in him a well of water
[53:13] springing
[53:14] up on into everlasting life
[53:18] the woman said unto him
[53:19] say
[53:20] give me this water
[53:22] that i test not
[53:24] not that come hither to
[53:26] draw jesus said unto her
[53:30] go
[53:30] call thy husband
[53:32] and come heather
[53:34] the woman answered and said
[53:37] i have no husband
[53:39] jesus said unto her
[53:41] thou has well said
[53:43] i have no husband
[53:45] for thou has had five husbands
[53:48] and he whom thou now has is not thy
[53:52] husband
[53:53] in that set down truly
[53:57] the woman said unto him say
[53:59] i perceive that thou art a prophet
[54:05] amen
[54:07] now you see the picture
[54:09] here is a woman
[54:12] who have never met jesus christ
[54:15] but that day
[54:18] once christ was communicating with her
[54:22] talking with them exchanging words with
[54:24] hair amen the woman was not just hearing
[54:29] the words were not just getting through
[54:32] her ears and passing through the other
[54:35] but the word of god or the weather
[54:38] proceeded out of god or jesus christ
[54:41] we're having some impact on that woman
[54:43] amen that's right amen
[54:46] that is what make man to make a decision
[54:50] whether to follow jesus or not
[54:54] hallelujah
[54:55] because the word of god does not come up
[54:57] from god
[54:59] for it to return to him void it must
[55:01] accomplish what it has been sent for
[55:06] so while the communication was going on
[55:08] like that then the woman said
[55:11] i perceive that you are the prophet yes
[55:15] now brother sister i want you to think
[55:17] about it right now
[55:19] jesus has been with the pharisees for a
[55:22] long time
[55:23] they hate him always
[55:25] they argue with him always they
[55:27] challenge him always but none of them
[55:30] perceive that he was a
[55:32] prophet but a woman that somebody called
[55:35] a prostitute amen
[55:38] a woman whom perhaps was not living a
[55:40] clear life
[55:42] that day when he heard the voice of
[55:44] jesus christ he said i perceive that you
[55:46] are a prophet
[55:48] so the woman was looking on jesus christ
[55:51] as such amen that's right
[55:54] amen
[55:58] verse 20 he said our fathers worship in
[56:01] this mountain
[56:02] and yes say that in jerusalem is the
[56:05] place where men ought to worship
[56:08] jesus said on your head
[56:10] woman
[56:11] believe me
[56:12] the hour cometh
[56:14] when ye shall another in this mountain
[56:16] not yet at jerusalem worship the father
[56:19] right
[56:20] yeah worship yeah no not
[56:23] yay worship ye
[56:25] know not what
[56:27] we know what we worship for salvation is
[56:30] of the jews
[56:32] but the hour cometh and now is when the
[56:35] truth worshipers shall worship the
[56:37] father and his spirit and in truth for
[56:40] the father secret side to worship him
[56:43] god is a spirit
[56:45] and they that worship him must worship
[56:47] him in spirit and truth
[56:50] you cannot worship god in flesh
[56:53] you cannot worship god by your mind
[56:56] you cannot worship god by your feelings
[56:59] you worship god by the word
[57:01] amen hallelujah you worship god by the
[57:04] word you're watching god by the spirit
[57:07] oh hallelujah
[57:10] verse
[57:11] the woman said unto him
[57:13] i know that the messiah cometh
[57:17] which is called christ
[57:19] when he is come he will tell us all
[57:24] things there's another step the woman
[57:27] was going to climb
[57:29] first of all he has noticed that this
[57:32] man that i'm talking with him he is
[57:34] nothing but a prophet
[57:36] now he
[57:38] she was challenging her faith once more
[57:42] after the prophet
[57:44] she knew that the messiah was going to
[57:46] come
[57:48] hallelujah amen amen jesus said
[57:52] i don't speak unto thee i am he
[57:56] and upon this came his disciples
[57:59] and marvel that he talked with the woman
[58:01] he had no man said what seeker dao or
[58:04] white turquoise die with her
[58:06] the woman then left her water pot and
[58:09] went away into the city and said to the
[58:12] men come see a man which told me all
[58:16] things that ever i did is not this the
[58:21] christ yes amen oh hallelujah
[58:25] it's not this the christ
[58:27] amen so the woman was waiting for a
[58:30] salvation
[58:32] and that was the day that her salvation
[58:35] was made manifested
[58:38] he said the man have told me of all that
[58:41] i have done is this not the christ
[58:45] so she was looking unto the coming of
[58:47] the christ
[58:49] so that her sins will be forgiving her
[58:52] but today people look on jesus christ
[58:55] and they still don't see who he is
[58:56] that's right
[58:58] that is what your sin is still remaining
[59:01] but when you look on jesus christ and
[59:03] you can see who he is and what he came
[59:05] for
[59:07] problems will roll away
[59:09] troubles will vanish
[59:11] hallelujah
[59:12] so it depends upon how you are looking
[59:16] on the lord jesus christ this woman said
[59:19] i perceive first of all you are the
[59:21] prophet and then later on he said that
[59:24] come and see my people yes amen
[59:28] perhaps he ran through all the phantom
[59:30] city and was calling people here and
[59:32] there come and see a man that i have
[59:35] seen is he not the messiah
[59:38] and what i love
[59:40] in this story was that
[59:43] after the people came and listened to
[59:47] the lord jesus christ
[59:50] they confessed
[59:52] and told the woman it's a woman
[59:55] not because you came to call us that is
[59:58] why we have believed but what we have
[1:00:02] had ourselves
[1:00:06] amen amen and amen
[1:00:09] many at times
[1:00:11] people will come face to face with the
[1:00:13] lord jesus christ even today as we live
[1:00:15] now you can present the message of this
[1:00:18] hour to people
[1:00:21] they will just take it
[1:00:23] and put it on your shelves
[1:00:28] tell them
[1:00:30] women should not be this
[1:00:32] they will tell you that those days are
[1:00:34] gone
[1:00:36] tell them that the church supposed to be
[1:00:38] this way
[1:00:39] they say those days are gone but is
[1:00:42] jesus christ gone
[1:00:46] hallelujah
[1:00:48] he said no i am with you
[1:00:51] always amen
[1:00:53] amen lord i am with you always but the
[1:00:56] system has been corrupted
[1:00:59] until people will look on jesus and they
[1:01:02] will not know who he is
[1:01:06] and the prophet said that spirits don't
[1:01:08] die amen so those spirits that came up
[1:01:11] from the pharisees is all over the world
[1:01:14] now
[1:01:15] as their pharisees look on jesus and
[1:01:17] they saw an elected mature they saw
[1:01:20] joseph's son they saw a belizeable
[1:01:24] the woman of the world saw the messiah
[1:01:27] amen
[1:01:28] the woman at the world saw the prophet
[1:01:31] the woman at the well saw the christ
[1:01:37] and the prophet asked us a question
[1:01:39] when we look on jesus today what do we
[1:01:42] see
[1:01:44] amen
[1:01:46] one day
[1:01:47] he was passing by somewhere also
[1:01:51] and there was a woman
[1:01:53] who had had an infirmity the bible said
[1:01:55] 12 years
[1:01:58] he has passed through so many uh what do
[1:02:01] we call them physicians
[1:02:03] that the problem will be solved
[1:02:07] but nobody could help this woman
[1:02:09] amen but that day
[1:02:12] when he saw jesus christ person
[1:02:15] he looked on jesus christ
[1:02:18] and he saw that he is a healer
[1:02:23] nobody advised the woman to do that
[1:02:26] he said but if i can touch the hem of
[1:02:28] his garment
[1:02:30] i'll be made whole
[1:02:31] so he touched the helm of the government
[1:02:34] of jesus christ
[1:02:35] and immediately the bible said
[1:02:37] immediately her trouble vanished
[1:02:41] and jesus christ himself felt the pool
[1:02:45] and began to ask peter somebody has
[1:02:47] touched me
[1:02:49] who has touched me
[1:02:50] hey peter said oh master a lot of people
[1:02:53] have let me touch you when we're on the
[1:02:55] way even here look at the trunks around
[1:02:57] you you say yes i know many people have
[1:03:00] touched me but they were ordinary
[1:03:02] touches
[1:03:03] but this particular one is a touch of
[1:03:06] faith
[1:03:08] because virtue has gone out of me
[1:03:13] whilst they were asking then the woman
[1:03:16] own up
[1:03:17] jesus look at the woman he's a woman
[1:03:20] your faith has set you free
[1:03:23] amen
[1:03:25] the faith that he had in her eyes
[1:03:27] to look on jesus
[1:03:30] if you look on jesus then where you make
[1:03:33] him to be that is how he'll appear to
[1:03:35] you
[1:03:37] if you look on him as your healer he'll
[1:03:39] heal you
[1:03:40] if you look at him as your problem
[1:03:42] solver he will solve your problem for
[1:03:43] you you if you see him as your redeemer
[1:03:45] he will redeem you he reviews him as
[1:03:47] your king's marriage he will redeem you
[1:03:50] whatever you look on jesus christ and
[1:03:52] you think of he has to accomplish that
[1:03:56] oh praise the name of our god
[1:03:59] amen and amen today you can also look on
[1:04:02] jesus christ and something supernatural
[1:04:05] will happen to your experience
[1:04:09] look at what
[1:04:10] the world is going through today
[1:04:12] confusion here
[1:04:14] confusion day
[1:04:16] the world is always you know a world
[1:04:20] system presidents and nations they are
[1:04:23] always calling for peace on this edge
[1:04:25] every nation america uh germany britain
[1:04:30] and russia oh
[1:04:32] they are calling for peace
[1:04:35] but what is the peace
[1:04:37] have them be able to bring the peace to
[1:04:38] the earth yes because they are talking
[1:04:42] about peace but they are not looking to
[1:04:44] the place of peace
[1:04:47] how can you settle or bring peace among
[1:04:50] the people when you don't have jesus
[1:04:52] christ in your life
[1:04:55] praise be the name of our god they have
[1:04:57] refused to look on the prince of peace
[1:05:00] how will they bring peace to the earth
[1:05:03] america don't have peace to offer
[1:05:06] germany don't have peace to offer ah
[1:05:08] britain don't have it right
[1:05:11] russia don't have it
[1:05:13] no nation on this side have peace to
[1:05:15] offer
[1:05:16] the only one that has the peace is the
[1:05:18] lord jesus christ
[1:05:20] and isaiah call him the prince of peace
[1:05:25] right from the walls the world war first
[1:05:27] and second
[1:05:29] and when this organization was started
[1:05:32] you know mounting up that they were
[1:05:34] trying to maintain peace in the world
[1:05:36] the western nations and the eastern
[1:05:38] nations
[1:05:40] they have tried and tried and tried and
[1:05:43] it came to a time they call it the cold
[1:05:45] war
[1:05:47] the war was still raging but it was cold
[1:05:49] it was not hot
[1:05:52] i don't know how many degrees
[1:05:54] but it was cold war
[1:05:57] until today
[1:05:58] we all know what has happened to the
[1:06:00] world now
[1:06:01] russia attacking ukraine
[1:06:04] and it has rather brought another
[1:06:06] problem
[1:06:08] today every government almost is
[1:06:10] complaining hardship in the country
[1:06:12] because of that war
[1:06:15] where is there peace
[1:06:18] where is their peace
[1:06:21] hallelujah
[1:06:23] and you see these have generated some
[1:06:25] fear
[1:06:26] even in some people
[1:06:29] but with christians we know where we are
[1:06:31] standing amen
[1:06:34] we know that russia indeed will have to
[1:06:37] do something right
[1:06:39] we know that russia will cause commotion
[1:06:41] because the prophet said that communism
[1:06:43] will not die
[1:06:45] said communism will crumble
[1:06:48] right from that time that he spoke about
[1:06:50] that he said communism will crumble and
[1:06:53] in 1989 1990 communism crumbled
[1:06:57] it disintegrated
[1:06:59] hallelujah but it's not dead
[1:07:02] because he said it's going to be a tool
[1:07:04] in god's hand to judge the
[1:07:09] but
[1:07:11] when he was elaborating the serving
[1:07:13] vision that you saw
[1:07:16] when he got to the seventh vision
[1:07:19] he said then after the seventh vision he
[1:07:22] had a blast boom
[1:07:24] behind him
[1:07:26] and he turned to look when he turned to
[1:07:28] look there was no nation again like
[1:07:30] america
[1:07:34] does that put fear in you
[1:07:37] does that put fear in you because you
[1:07:39] live in america
[1:07:41] you are living in america but you're not
[1:07:42] american
[1:07:44] you are christian
[1:07:47] hallelujah
[1:07:49] the holy spirit has come into christians
[1:07:53] yes
[1:07:55] are you catching it
[1:07:56] it has come into christians not
[1:07:58] americans if it's america every american
[1:08:01] will be baptized with the holy ghost
[1:08:05] but you are selected americans as
[1:08:07] children of god
[1:08:09] that is why you have the holy ghost and
[1:08:11] this is your blessed assurance
[1:08:15] and the prophet said that watch russia
[1:08:18] watch russia watch the king of the north
[1:08:23] that's always here when russia began to
[1:08:26] do things of this nature
[1:08:29] we have already been informed
[1:08:33] the prophet said
[1:08:36] no but when he was speaking that time he
[1:08:38] said that there is a bomb hanging in
[1:08:40] russia
[1:08:41] to blast this nation
[1:08:45] but this is the blessed assurance
[1:08:48] he said no bomb will land on this land
[1:08:54] this land that we are standing on right
[1:08:56] now
[1:08:58] he said no pump
[1:08:59] whether hydrogen
[1:09:02] whether nuclear
[1:09:04] weather can become
[1:09:06] whether whatever ballistic
[1:09:08] or bullistic
[1:09:10] or realistic
[1:09:12] whatever listic
[1:09:14] it will never land here until you you
[1:09:17] you you and me
[1:09:19] we are being raptured away
[1:09:23] why
[1:09:24] we are looking on jesus
[1:09:26] [Music]
[1:09:28] praise be the name of our god
[1:09:30] the wealthy look on him and they don't
[1:09:33] see nothing
[1:09:35] they will look on jesus and they don't
[1:09:37] see anything
[1:09:38] but you and i we look on jesus
[1:09:41] and we see the messiah
[1:09:43] like the woman of the world
[1:09:45] we look on jesus and we see our kinsmen
[1:09:47] redeemer
[1:09:49] we look on jesus and we see the place of
[1:09:51] peace
[1:09:52] we look on jesus and we see the father
[1:09:55] the son the holy ghost
[1:09:57] we look on jesus and we see the great
[1:09:59] almighty god
[1:10:02] hallelujah
[1:10:05] yes sir
[1:10:06] we look on jesus and we see our healer
[1:10:09] [Music]
[1:10:11] we look on jesus and our problems rode
[1:10:13] away
[1:10:18] amen amen amen amen he is the same
[1:10:21] yesterday today and forever
[1:10:24] and today
[1:10:25] as we speak beloved brother
[1:10:27] he is
[1:10:29] the one that we are talking about
[1:10:31] amen he read the scripture
[1:10:37] and he gave it to them
[1:10:40] they looked on him
[1:10:42] and he said this day
[1:10:44] this scripture is fulfilled
[1:10:49] but he said
[1:10:51] is it not joseph's son
[1:10:54] how can he make such a proclamation
[1:10:58] to you
[1:11:00] you see him as just have son
[1:11:03] oh
[1:11:04] brother sister
[1:11:07] like how you see me right now
[1:11:09] you see me as a ghanaian preacher
[1:11:12] oh no
[1:11:14] i am a preacher of the kingdom of god
[1:11:17] amen
[1:11:18] i look on you and i'll see you as
[1:11:20] american and see you as a child of god a
[1:11:23] child of the kingdom
[1:11:26] because we are all looking on jesus
[1:11:28] christ
[1:11:30] and that is the day that we are waiting
[1:11:31] for
[1:11:32] that this body will be changed because
[1:11:35] we are looking on jesus christ
[1:11:38] now when peter and john got to the gate
[1:11:43] and they saw that little man
[1:11:45] always begging for arms right
[1:11:49] the bible said i searched for what he
[1:11:50] said
[1:11:51] expected to receive something from them
[1:11:54] but peter
[1:11:56] and john
[1:11:58] told this man
[1:12:00] silver and gold that john we don't have
[1:12:02] for you
[1:12:05] but such as we have we are given to you
[1:12:10] in the name of jesus christ of nazareth
[1:12:14] rise
[1:12:17] and the man arose
[1:12:20] the man was not looking at the side
[1:12:24] but you look on peter
[1:12:26] and john
[1:12:28] but you see peter also knew
[1:12:31] that he was not standing there along
[1:12:34] with john
[1:12:35] amen
[1:12:37] he knew that jesus christ was standing
[1:12:39] by them
[1:12:41] hallelujah
[1:12:43] so peter didn't say look on me
[1:12:45] or look on john he said look on us
[1:12:50] and in the name of jesus christ he
[1:12:52] didn't say in the name of peter in the
[1:12:54] name of john no they were inviting the
[1:12:57] man to look on jesus
[1:12:59] [Music]
[1:13:00] and immediately
[1:13:02] the man who was born crippled
[1:13:05] got up on the street
[1:13:07] and shook himself and about he started
[1:13:09] jumping and he started limping and was
[1:13:12] praising god
[1:13:13] oh god will you look on jesus
[1:13:18] amen and amen and amen
[1:13:24] now
[1:13:25] let me quote this from the prophet okay
[1:13:28] if i would if you don't call the prophet
[1:13:30] we don't have any message
[1:13:34] so i always love to quote the prophet
[1:13:37] he said now
[1:13:38] some people
[1:13:40] when they look on jesus
[1:13:43] they look and see him
[1:13:47] as a church founder
[1:13:50] or church organizer
[1:13:53] or maybe
[1:13:54] a creed for a church
[1:13:57] that is what many people look to jesus
[1:13:59] to see
[1:14:01] he's just a new creed that was added to
[1:14:03] an old doctrine
[1:14:05] now many people look on and see him like
[1:14:08] that
[1:14:10] some look and see him as a myth
[1:14:14] santa claus
[1:14:16] or some of them look to him as some
[1:14:19] historical act that god did many years
[1:14:21] ago
[1:14:24] some of them looked to him yet as a baby
[1:14:27] in a manger oh god have mercy
[1:14:31] some still have their mind that jesus
[1:14:34] christ is still a baby in a basket
[1:14:41] god have mercy
[1:14:44] some also still look on him as the jesus
[1:14:47] christ is hanging on a cross
[1:14:51] some also still look on him and there
[1:14:53] are so many
[1:14:55] ideas
[1:14:56] and thoughts
[1:14:59] now
[1:15:02] but the question is
[1:15:04] what do you see when you look at him
[1:15:08] the prophet is asking me and you
[1:15:12] do you see the second person of
[1:15:14] trinity
[1:15:15] or do you see a trinity
[1:15:18] you only see him as you look at him
[1:15:21] through the weight
[1:15:25] that is the only way
[1:15:27] that you know it
[1:15:29] because he is the word
[1:15:31] he to reveal himself
[1:15:33] depends on what you are looking
[1:15:36] for it depends what you are looking for
[1:15:41] hallelujah
[1:15:42] if you are looking on jesus christ
[1:15:45] to see your redeemer he will be your
[1:15:48] redeemer
[1:15:50] if we are looking to jesus christ as the
[1:15:52] prince of peace he will be your place of
[1:15:54] peace
[1:15:56] if you are looking on jesus christ as
[1:15:58] your the almighty god he will be your
[1:16:01] almighty god
[1:16:03] why is it that people don't want still
[1:16:05] don't want to believe that he is the
[1:16:07] same god
[1:16:10] that met moses
[1:16:12] that met abraham
[1:16:13] that met noah and the rest
[1:16:16] who is jesus christ of they don't want
[1:16:18] to believe it because they are looking
[1:16:20] for something else
[1:16:24] hallelujah amen
[1:16:27] now
[1:16:35] look at cleopas
[1:16:39] okay now let me start it this way
[1:16:41] and now what we want to look at then if
[1:16:44] jesus has raised from the dead
[1:16:46] can we see him
[1:16:51] now there's only one way to to do
[1:16:54] and that is go and see what kind of a
[1:16:56] person we will look for
[1:16:59] if we're going tonight to see jesus
[1:17:02] if jesus were to be in front of tonight
[1:17:06] what type of a man will you look for
[1:17:13] what type of a man
[1:17:15] will you look for a man that has some uh
[1:17:21] some i don't know i don't know where to
[1:17:22] put it
[1:17:23] some golden golden you know suit on
[1:17:26] himself
[1:17:28] with gold issue
[1:17:31] perhaps with golden tie
[1:17:34] hallelujah
[1:17:36] is that the kind of
[1:17:38] jesus that you'd like to see
[1:17:41] praise the name of our god
[1:17:43] the prophet is asking what type of jesus
[1:17:46] would you like to see
[1:17:48] if he appear right now on the street of
[1:17:50] fountain
[1:17:56] our god is not asleep
[1:17:59] our god is not dead
[1:18:01] our god is our life in our soul
[1:18:06] amen
[1:18:07] and that is what makes us go and come
[1:18:10] with the same word of god
[1:18:14] will you go and look for some fellow
[1:18:18] that was way up in some great high
[1:18:21] cathedral
[1:18:22] with real priestly looking clothes
[1:18:26] would that be the kind of jesus you were
[1:18:29] looking for
[1:18:30] if it is
[1:18:32] he certainly changed since he was here
[1:18:34] on earth the last time
[1:18:38] for he dressed just like ordinary man
[1:18:42] he went in among men
[1:18:44] in and out among men and they didn't
[1:18:46] even know him because he looked so
[1:18:49] common like other men
[1:18:52] remember
[1:18:53] judas historians told the soldiers
[1:18:55] unless i betray him you would never know
[1:18:58] him amongst us
[1:18:59] so how i'm going to put i will just kiss
[1:19:02] him the one that i'll kiss he is the one
[1:19:06] he was so common among his people
[1:19:10] he was not so special
[1:19:12] and thank god we also are not special
[1:19:14] amen
[1:19:16] we are we can fit ourselves into all the
[1:19:18] society amen
[1:19:20] hallelujah
[1:19:22] we don't raise our hands our shoulders
[1:19:24] we don't puff up because the holy ghost
[1:19:27] humbles us
[1:19:30] the holy ghost humbles and we always
[1:19:32] want the holy ghost to handle us
[1:19:34] jesus said the pride he will
[1:19:37] crash away
[1:19:39] can i go on a little
[1:19:44] he drug just like ordinary man
[1:19:47] he went in among men
[1:19:49] in and out among men
[1:19:51] and they didn't even know him because he
[1:19:53] looked so common like other men
[1:19:56] there was nothing in him
[1:19:59] concupious about the lord jesus to look
[1:20:02] at him
[1:20:03] he will do a certain thing
[1:20:05] that is the only way they know him
[1:20:09] by his miracles and the signs that he
[1:20:12] did on the road from emmaus
[1:20:15] after his resurrection
[1:20:17] do you see it
[1:20:18] cleopas and his friend
[1:20:21] were working with him after his
[1:20:23] resurrection and he was so plain yet
[1:20:26] until they didn't recognize him until he
[1:20:29] did a certain thing like he used to do
[1:20:32] it before he was crucified
[1:20:36] he's the same yesterday
[1:20:39] today and forever
[1:20:42] he changed it not
[1:20:45] and that was
[1:20:46] what gave them the revelation
[1:20:50] can we imagine these people have been
[1:20:52] with jesus christ
[1:20:55] christ fed them christ gave them power
[1:20:57] to go and heal
[1:21:00] christ did so many things he lived with
[1:21:02] them so many years at least three and a
[1:21:04] half years
[1:21:06] and he promised them that
[1:21:08] he would die
[1:21:10] and the teddy he will resurrect amen
[1:21:15] they killed him
[1:21:18] he was buried
[1:21:20] that teddy he arose from the dead
[1:21:24] the woman went
[1:21:26] and saw an empty tomb right amen
[1:21:29] they rushed to the disciples peter and
[1:21:32] the rest and told them hey
[1:21:34] the master is risen indeed
[1:21:38] they didn't believe it
[1:21:42] himself didn't believe it
[1:21:45] that is why him and john run to the
[1:21:48] self-worker
[1:21:49] they wanted to go and see if he believed
[1:21:51] would you think he'll run there
[1:21:54] he didn't believe it so he ran he wanted
[1:21:57] to go and find out
[1:21:59] and when they went and they also saw an
[1:22:01] empty tomb
[1:22:03] the confusion became so great now
[1:22:05] amen they came back home confused they
[1:22:08] didn't know what to do
[1:22:10] they were talking and talking and
[1:22:13] talking
[1:22:14] the woman said we are telling you that
[1:22:17] the lord is risen
[1:22:19] but that doesn't mean that woman can
[1:22:20] preach anyway
[1:22:23] yeah when you go when you come to africa
[1:22:25] some of the women argues those women
[1:22:28] calling themselves pastors and
[1:22:30] evangelists whenever they want to argue
[1:22:32] they say yes but it's a woman that saw
[1:22:34] that empty tomb
[1:22:36] doesn't matter
[1:22:37] you can see an empty tomb but you are
[1:22:39] not given any power to preach
[1:22:42] hallelujah
[1:22:44] and so they were contemplating on this
[1:22:46] until
[1:22:48] it was
[1:22:49] late they have to you know disperse
[1:22:53] and it was by this that cleopas and the
[1:22:55] other man
[1:22:56] they were going to their village and
[1:22:58] they were talking so much confused
[1:23:01] talking about the resurrection the death
[1:23:03] and resurrection of jesus christ and how
[1:23:05] the woman has come to confuse them the
[1:23:07] more
[1:23:08] the women are telling the truth and you
[1:23:10] say they are confusing you
[1:23:12] and the bible says while they were going
[1:23:14] then all of a sudden
[1:23:16] they saw a man walking with them
[1:23:20] and the man asks them
[1:23:22] what are you discussing
[1:23:25] that you are so
[1:23:27] i mean
[1:23:28] broken-hearted and confused
[1:23:33] and then they asked him are you a
[1:23:34] stranger in phantom here
[1:23:36] oh yes i'm a stranger
[1:23:39] hallelujah
[1:23:40] is that you a sonja in jerusalem have
[1:23:43] you heard what has gone on these few
[1:23:46] days have you heard it a man called
[1:23:49] jesus
[1:23:51] very powerful man indeed a miracle
[1:23:53] worker
[1:23:54] a preacher with authority
[1:23:57] the one who could raise the dead
[1:23:59] he died
[1:24:01] and was buried
[1:24:04] and uh this morning some of our company
[1:24:06] have come to tell us that he he is risen
[1:24:09] and that is why we are so much confused
[1:24:12] and jesus look at them and say you fools
[1:24:16] this was a strong statement
[1:24:19] you fools
[1:24:21] you look on jesus and you don't see that
[1:24:23] he's jesus
[1:24:25] jesus said that you are full
[1:24:28] so so what can we tell the people who
[1:24:31] today look upon the message of this hour
[1:24:37] anybody that that throws the message of
[1:24:39] this hour away said i'll not believe
[1:24:42] that
[1:24:43] what can we tell that person
[1:24:46] jesus christ look on them and say that
[1:24:48] you're fools
[1:24:49] for not believing what the prophets have
[1:24:51] told you
[1:24:52] amen
[1:24:54] and today people can stand and challenge
[1:24:56] william brahm
[1:24:57] in your pulpit
[1:24:59] oh god have mercy
[1:25:01] they don't know what they are doing
[1:25:03] many a time we say they don't know what
[1:25:04] they are doing but sometimes we should
[1:25:06] tell them that they know what they are
[1:25:07] doing
[1:25:09] god have
[1:25:10] mercy he said don't you believe what the
[1:25:13] prophets have told you
[1:25:16] then
[1:25:17] jesus christ then started
[1:25:20] breaking the word
[1:25:22] right from the prophet of
[1:25:24] old till the time that they were
[1:25:27] communicating on the road to damascus
[1:25:30] i'm sorry emmaus
[1:25:32] and the bible say that
[1:25:34] he spoke the word
[1:25:37] and told them things
[1:25:39] and their heart
[1:25:41] oh yes
[1:25:43] their heart
[1:25:44] was bleeding
[1:25:46] to respond to the truth
[1:25:51] and then they got to the village
[1:25:54] then jesus
[1:25:56] according to the bible
[1:25:58] told them okay bye bye i am going to
[1:26:00] continue my journey
[1:26:02] they said no no no master
[1:26:05] the place is dangerous
[1:26:07] don't go come and pass the night with us
[1:26:10] and to uh
[1:26:12] when the day comes you can continue your
[1:26:13] journey wherever you want to go you say
[1:26:15] okay
[1:26:18] then
[1:26:20] they entered into their house
[1:26:22] fortunately for them food was ready
[1:26:25] and they asked for the food everybody
[1:26:26] like food you know
[1:26:29] i like it and you like it
[1:26:31] amen
[1:26:33] food was ready they set the table
[1:26:36] and can you imagine
[1:26:39] these people didn't know jesus
[1:26:41] because at that time they have not
[1:26:42] recognized whom he was
[1:26:45] but they asked him to bless the food
[1:26:51] why
[1:26:53] a stranger that you don't know
[1:26:55] you don't know his faith
[1:26:57] but they did that because of what they
[1:26:59] had from him
[1:27:01] they were so convinced that this man
[1:27:04] is someone that holds power
[1:27:08] bless the food for us to eat
[1:27:11] and the bible said that jesus christ
[1:27:13] bless the food
[1:27:14] the same way that he used to bless when
[1:27:18] he was yet with them
[1:27:20] so before they said amen
[1:27:22] their eyes opened
[1:27:25] and before their eyes got opened he
[1:27:27] vanished from among them
[1:27:31] and these men who were just a few
[1:27:33] minutes back telling jesus the area was
[1:27:37] dangerous for that matter he should not
[1:27:39] go they forgot about the danger
[1:27:42] and the road arose and they started
[1:27:45] running through the darkness they were
[1:27:47] going back to jerusalem to go and give
[1:27:49] the good news to peter and the rest that
[1:27:52] indeed the messiah is risen
[1:27:58] amen they look on jesus christ while he
[1:28:02] was preaching the word to them but their
[1:28:04] eyes were holding
[1:28:06] but when the word of amen came
[1:28:10] amen means
[1:28:11] let it be
[1:28:14] their eyes open
[1:28:16] somebody should look on the lord jesus
[1:28:18] tonight with an amen
[1:28:22] somebody should look on jesus right now
[1:28:24] with an amen amen
[1:28:26] and the eyes
[1:28:28] will open
[1:28:30] they went back to peter and the rest he
[1:28:32] said peter come and see the lord is
[1:28:35] indeed is ready for he has revealed
[1:28:37] himself to us
[1:28:40] today
[1:28:42] many people are confused
[1:28:45] many people don't know what to do
[1:28:47] but look he said look at cleopas
[1:28:51] and then after the resurrection
[1:28:53] jesus identified himself the way he
[1:28:56] broke that bread
[1:28:58] he did it just the way he did it before
[1:29:00] he was crucified
[1:29:02] and then that identified his
[1:29:04] characteristics
[1:29:06] because that is the way he did it
[1:29:10] now
[1:29:11] if he was here tonight
[1:29:14] how will he identify himself
[1:29:18] just like he did yesterday
[1:29:21] for he is the same today and it will be
[1:29:23] forever it is the identification
[1:29:27] today
[1:29:29] he will not be here in this body
[1:29:34] but he is here
[1:29:36] in the weight
[1:29:38] because the weight is manifested
[1:29:41] now we have a manifested weight
[1:29:44] i understand then we have a manifested
[1:29:47] word so if we are looking to jesus
[1:29:48] christ today we look on him in his word
[1:29:54] all the messages that the prophet came
[1:29:56] to preach now their titles were not just
[1:29:59] just west they were prophetic
[1:30:04] christ is the mystery of god revealed
[1:30:07] amen
[1:30:10] the thinking man's father
[1:30:13] the oddball
[1:30:16] spoken word is the original seat
[1:30:20] three kinds of believers
[1:30:23] what again the feast of trumpets
[1:30:27] and a whole lot
[1:30:29] standing in the gap
[1:30:33] leadership right
[1:30:34] indictment
[1:30:37] revelation of the serving seals
[1:30:41] amen
[1:30:43] oh brother sister
[1:30:45] we are blessed
[1:30:46] amen we are blessed
[1:30:49] that today when we look into the word of
[1:30:51] god we see jesus christ
[1:30:53] we don't just see a written word
[1:30:56] amen amen but we see jesus christ
[1:31:02] he said and that day
[1:31:03] you will know that i am in my father i
[1:31:07] in you and you in me and the prophet
[1:31:09] said what day he said today
[1:31:12] amen
[1:31:13] when the seals are opened
[1:31:19] because look when malachi 4 came into
[1:31:23] manifestation
[1:31:25] malachi 4
[1:31:27] came
[1:31:28] to turn the heart of the children back
[1:31:30] to the fathers
[1:31:33] and the prophet said
[1:31:35] the revelation in the seven fields
[1:31:39] after it is open
[1:31:41] that is what literally turned the heart
[1:31:44] of the children back to the pentecostal
[1:31:46] fathers
[1:31:47] exactly so amen
[1:31:50] so beloved
[1:31:51] what we are doing right now we are not
[1:31:53] just plain tapes or i'm sorry we are not
[1:31:56] just reading letters
[1:31:59] but we are presenting jesus christ to
[1:32:01] the people
[1:32:03] in the message of this hour
[1:32:06] it is full in the text is full in the
[1:32:09] message books
[1:32:12] the reason why
[1:32:14] one day
[1:32:15] well i don't know your experience yet
[1:32:19] but one day i myself a pentecostal baby
[1:32:24] when i was thinking that when i speak in
[1:32:27] tongues i had the holy ghost
[1:32:30] and i spoke in tongues and i spoke in
[1:32:33] tongues but i couldn't live a christian
[1:32:34] life
[1:32:36] it was deception
[1:32:39] because others were doing it and you are
[1:32:41] forced also to do it because they have
[1:32:42] indoctrinated the people that if you
[1:32:44] don't speak in tongues you don't have
[1:32:45] the holy ghost
[1:32:48] so everybody was trying to do something
[1:32:58] and they respect you in the church when
[1:33:00] you do that
[1:33:02] but all was fake
[1:33:05] our deception
[1:33:07] until
[1:33:08] my pastor by then
[1:33:10] any time i remember that i said praise
[1:33:12] be to god
[1:33:15] one day he came to the church he said
[1:33:17] hey we have a new thing
[1:33:19] so what the new
[1:33:20] thing then he brought the messages
[1:33:25] say look
[1:33:26] this thing i found it some time back but
[1:33:28] i didn't believe it
[1:33:30] but this time i cannot hide it
[1:33:32] i am bringing it to you amen
[1:33:35] and pastor presented the message
[1:33:38] in the church
[1:33:41] and the church divided i wouldn't say
[1:33:43] into two
[1:33:45] because majority of the people left the
[1:33:47] church
[1:33:49] we were left with a handful of people in
[1:33:52] the church
[1:33:53] and
[1:33:54] my pastor gave me
[1:33:56] one particular message book that day
[1:33:59] he said
[1:34:00] daniel read this
[1:34:02] but john i said to the glory of god
[1:34:05] i read the book
[1:34:07] i didn't see anything
[1:34:11] so i went back
[1:34:13] into a pastor i've read the book by the
[1:34:16] i didn't see anything in there
[1:34:19] it's okay
[1:34:20] take this one
[1:34:22] go and read this one too
[1:34:25] and that message book was the thinking's
[1:34:27] man's filter
[1:34:29] oh
[1:34:30] brother when i opened the book
[1:34:34] and i was reading it
[1:34:36] i said what
[1:34:38] i felt something dropping into my soul
[1:34:43] then i started hearing myself saying
[1:34:45] amen
[1:34:46] amen
[1:34:48] amen
[1:34:50] and then i rushed to my past i said
[1:34:52] pastor anymore
[1:34:56] and from that day
[1:35:00] i saw jesus christ in his word
[1:35:06] i saw jesus christ in the written word
[1:35:11] and since from that day when i look on
[1:35:14] jesus i see my savior
[1:35:17] from that day when i look on jesus i see
[1:35:20] my redeemer
[1:35:22] from that day when i look on jesus i see
[1:35:25] the king of kings and the lord of lords
[1:35:29] from that day when i look on jesus i see
[1:35:32] my problems over
[1:35:35] and when i look on him today i see my
[1:35:37] victory
[1:35:40] hallelujah
[1:35:43] oh my brother my sister
[1:35:45] you can look on jesus christ right now
[1:35:48] and your life will change
[1:35:51] you can look on jesus christ right now
[1:35:53] and something will happen to your
[1:35:55] experience
[1:35:56] you can look on jesus christ right now
[1:35:59] because the world is almost coming to an
[1:36:02] end
[1:36:03] the world is confused
[1:36:06] even so-called pastors and ministers and
[1:36:09] churches they are all confused
[1:36:11] but praise be to god
[1:36:14] he has given us a blessed assurance
[1:36:19] and nothing shakes us
[1:36:21] because we know whom we are looking onto
[1:36:25] amen
[1:36:27] permit me to read my last quote so that
[1:36:28] we can close
[1:36:31] i hope i'm not taking too much time
[1:36:34] amen
[1:36:36] he is the same he was a prophet
[1:36:40] he was in them
[1:36:42] he was in the psalms
[1:36:44] he was in the history
[1:36:46] and he is the things to come
[1:36:48] the same yesterday today and forever
[1:36:52] hallelujah
[1:36:53] hebrews 3 8 if you are writing it down
[1:36:57] he should he should be the principal
[1:37:01] if that is what he is and we believe it
[1:37:04] don't we
[1:37:05] then if he is that then he should be the
[1:37:09] principal team of our talking
[1:37:12] anywhere you are talk about jesus
[1:37:16] anywhere you are talk about jesus
[1:37:18] if you are in your school talk about
[1:37:20] jesus if you are at home talk about
[1:37:23] jesus if you are in a restaurant talk
[1:37:25] about jesus
[1:37:27] if you are at your workplace talk about
[1:37:29] jesus
[1:37:32] hallelujah and amen and amen and amen
[1:37:37] let the world talk for him themselves
[1:37:39] but we will control to talk about jesus
[1:37:41] christ
[1:37:45] he should be the principal team of our
[1:37:47] life
[1:37:49] if he is the principal team of the bible
[1:37:53] and the bible is in us
[1:37:55] then he should be the principal team of
[1:37:58] everything that we do
[1:38:01] hallelujah
[1:38:03] all think should be christ
[1:38:06] anything we do our thing should be
[1:38:08] christ is that right
[1:38:09] and that's what the prophet asked here i
[1:38:12] said prof that is right
[1:38:14] we must always think about jesus
[1:38:18] we must always talk about jesus we must
[1:38:21] always eat jesus we must always drink
[1:38:24] jesus we must always sleep jesus when we
[1:38:27] get up from our bed it must be jesus any
[1:38:30] place that we do it must be jesus and
[1:38:32] jesus and jesus
[1:38:35] because if somebody could look on him
[1:38:38] and
[1:38:39] get their healing
[1:38:41] somebody could look on him and say i
[1:38:44] perceive that you are a prophet and from
[1:38:46] that day her prostitution sees
[1:38:50] he can do something to our life this
[1:38:53] time also

[1:42:37] that is why he sent his angels
[1:42:40] to come and give us the visions of the
[1:42:43] rapture
[1:42:45] he sent paul
[1:42:47] he sent
[1:42:49] arenas
[1:42:50] he sent nothing
[1:42:52] he sent columba
[1:42:55] he sent martin luther
[1:42:57] he sent john wesley
[1:42:59] and he sent willian marion brown
[1:43:02] the angels that were in his right hand
[1:43:07] to come and give us the visions of the
[1:43:09] rapture
[1:43:12] and today
[1:43:14] we say praise be to his holy name
[1:43:17] we have the vision of the rupture
[1:43:20] and we are preparing to enter into it
[1:43:23] but we only do that when we keep looking
[1:43:26] on jesus
[1:43:28] god bless all of you

[1:43:40] your holy name
[1:43:43] father
[1:43:44] as it was
[1:43:46] on that day
[1:43:48] on the way to a mouse
[1:43:52] cleopas and his friend
[1:43:55] could not
[1:43:56] descend
[1:43:59] until
[1:44:00] the way and manner
[1:44:04] you dealt with them when you were
[1:44:05] blessing food while you were yelling
[1:44:07] with them you did it the same way
[1:44:10] and their eyes open to know you
[1:44:13] heavenly father
[1:44:15] we thank you
[1:44:17] in this our generation

[1:44:26] we have known you to be our king
[1:44:30] the woman at the well saw you father
[1:44:33] and he realized that you were the christ
[1:44:37] the woman with the blood issue
[1:44:39] said no you are the healer
[1:44:42] today
[1:44:43] no matter what the pharisees look on you
[1:44:45] whether they call you joseph's son
[1:44:47] whether they call you berserboob what
[1:44:49] i'll call you a legend my child father

[1:45:02] lord jesus in this flesh
[1:45:04] there are so many things that war
[1:45:06] against us
[1:45:07] but our faith
[1:45:09] is anchored within the veil
[1:45:12] we pray therefore lord help us
[1:45:14] father any place that we fall short be
[1:45:16] merciful upon us
[1:45:18] continue to cleanse us and wash us

[1:45:45] the utter and finish of our faith
[1:45:47] and as we know one of these days oh god
[1:45:50] this body is going to be changed and

[1:46:37] we all lift our holy hands
[1:46:39] and say
[1:46:40] thank you
[1:46:41] our kin of kings and lord of lords
[1:46:45] in jesus christ and we pray
[1:46:47] amen
[1:46:49] john
[1:47:01] it reminded me of that centurion
[1:47:04] who quickly knew
[1:47:07] who jesus was
[1:47:10] as a healer
[1:47:13] and he looked to him for healer
[1:47:16] and wasn't interested in anything but
[1:47:18] just the opening of the word the
[1:47:20] speaking of the word
[1:47:23] and
[1:47:25] our hardest job
[1:47:27] is to not look at the veil
[1:47:30] that is
[1:47:31] where the word is coming forth from
[1:47:34] i think it's our hardest job when we
[1:47:36] come to church
[1:47:38] that we need to see
[1:47:39] the opening of the word to our hearts
[1:47:43] and
[1:47:44] the word is still a discerner
[1:47:47] you know we we may have not
[1:47:48] had five
[1:47:50] husbands
[1:47:52] but that word is still discerning
[1:47:55] what we are doing in our lives
[1:47:58] and
[1:47:59] it's easy
[1:48:00] if the preacher looks directly at you
[1:48:02] and and says you've got 682 dollars in
[1:48:05] your bank account you try taking 24 out
[1:48:07] today they wouldn't let you and that
[1:48:09] would be easy
[1:48:10] to say okay god spoke to me
[1:48:13] but it's not always like that but
[1:48:16] it god is still speaking to us we can't
[1:48:18] come to church and god not speak to us
[1:48:22] we just got to recognize him focus and
[1:48:26] be so glued
[1:48:28] to him speaking to us personally
[1:48:31] not so much collectively
[1:48:33] we may miss it in the show as it were
[1:48:36] but we want to hear god personally i
[1:48:38] appreciate that message today thank you
[1:48:41] very very much let's stand together and
[1:48:43] just think turn your eyes upon jesus and
[1:48:46] we'll sing a couple
[1:48:48] songs before we're dismissed it's
[1:48:50] wherever we're at tomorrow well
