our request this morning lord jesus hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah amen brother john just come forward amen hallelujah amen amen by his grace for a child of the king amen so good to see everyone here today it's good to be in god's house amen and those of you that weren't here wednesday we heard a masterpiece that was um it was a masterpiece and every time brother aaron comes i just feel so refreshed so strengthen and lifted up and i believe that we are privileged people today to have the ministry uh that we're going to hear this morning and um brother aaron and sister elizabeth had started a church there in arizona and it is been so successful and god is blessing them majorly and we're grateful to the lord for that you may be seated just a moment um and we're just uh very grateful and we have a great respect for brother aaron in his ministry and i just love his ministry and i wish he was here all the time i've said it many times but we're grateful to have it when we do have it amen and we're certainly grateful for his family and i i didn't ask but do you think we you've got time for a song or we don't have to if you don't want to it's up to you amen well maybe we'll have this psalm before we have the ministry of the word amen [Music] there was adam who walked alone with god in eden then there was enough who walks so pleasing god took him home next came noah and abraham they too walked righteous before their god each day with him they had a of living faith [Music] come walk with me my precious bride [Music] won't you come come walk with me the greatest privilege you'll ever know i didn't come to take the world but i i've chosen you oh my lovely wife it's that oneness i long to share [Music] today i invite you my spotless wife come walk with me i'll take your burdens your broken hearts [Music] your uncertainties you'll learn my ways talk face to face you alone my secrets will hear i'll make you perfect by my word and one we shall become [Music] come walk with me my precious bride won't you come come walk with me the greatest privilege you'll ever know i didn't come to take the world but i i've chosen you oh my lovely wife it's that oneness i long to share yes my lovely wife it's that one i long to share [Music] [Applause] i believe brother branham said the perfect answer when god asked him would you would you like to walk with me what greater privilege could we have on earth than to walk with the lord nothing nothing greater and he's given every one of us that same we think well it would be so neat just to you know be walking in the woods and have god speak that but you know god speaks that every time we come to church every time we hear his word he's wanting us to walk with his word and we walk with his word it's walking with him amen let's stand together and as our brother comes to give us the the word of life let's just take a second and worship the lord give the lord thanks for the word that's going to come the word the living word is going to be presented to us and let's just take a moment and thank god for the word that's about to come father we thank you for the word that's going to be presented to us right now lord we thank you for for for preparing it lord we we thank you for bringing it to us lord and we we cherish this word lord may it find a resting place in our hearts lord god we thank you for your word we thank you for this word that's coming lord jesus we worship you and we praise you for it in jesus wonderful name amen amen amen only believe only belief [Music] all things are possible holy believe only believe oh [Music] all things are possible only believe jesus is here all things are possible jesus is here jesus is here [Music] jesus is here all things are possible jesus let's sing lord i believe and lord i believe lord i believe all things are possible lord i believe lord i believe lord i believe all things are possible lord i believe amen praise the lord while we're just in this tremendous atmosphere why don't we just turn to revelations chapter 2 we'll read one verse there verse 24 revelations chapter 2 verse 24. i'm so glad to be in the house of lord today we should never take these meetings for granted and uh we are uh we consider it a privilege every time we're able to make it to the house of the lord and we're certainly counted a great privilege to be here today brother john and to be ministered uh not only just behind this uh sacred desk that you stand behind but before the people that god has called as such a privilege to stand before the elect and minister and is it okay to mention where i was yesterday afternoon not the barn wait brother john took us by and we saw the church give us a little sneak peek i know he's kind of been protective of it because he wants to i can understand that burden that heart you know brother braham even said that god likes to surprise his children and so i think even as a pastor you some you want you want things to be special so he took us by to see the uh the church since it might be our best chance to see it and oh my it's just wonderful to see what the lord is doing we rejoiced when you got the building and i felt like if you could have just moved in there day one and started having church it would have been awesome but you know the perfectionist that brother john is uh he just he's really putting a lot of thought a lot of labor and effort into creating a beautiful sanctuary for you to come and gather and to worship so continue to pray for him find out ways you can support i guess without being present and with any kind of new church or any kind of move in there will be plenty of work to do once you're in uh so maybe save up your energy and your resources for that moment but it's just a beautiful doing a tremendous job brother john and i think the beauty of the church we know the beauty of the church is the character of the people this has been a work in progress for 20 years and we think it's just marvelous what god has been doing spiritually and your character and your faithfulness to this facility to this location and we're certainly anxious to see that you all are moving into a new church sometime soon i'm not trying to put any pressure on you in a timeline i just know it's got to be soon and then we remarked about it wednesday night and um was even thinking about it yesterday but it was 20 years ago it was may 2001 that you started cinderlight is that correct so it's 20 years this year is a 20-year anniversary and the first visiting minister they ever had in and they thought it was going to be the end of the work they had me in to preach and i came and preached i thought it was just faith building and i thought it was you know real foundational and i guess people thought i was a prosperity preacher and i used malachi 4 just as a reference to how there was prophecy that she created some expectation and sister cheryl got nervous and thought i was going to ruin everything but that was i was the first one in to minister in august of was it 16 and 17 is that what it was in 2001 and so we feel a real special connection to you just as a man of god not just because we married into the family but just as a man of god and so it's just exciting to see what god is doing excited to see um brother mark when did you start coming shortly after that or 2004 yeah 2004. i mean just to see 17 years later a young man uh following in uh you know just serving the lord and following the will of god and everyone being together i think it's just marvelous to see it so god bless you tremendously may god bless you richly we love you very very deeply revelations chapter 2 verse 24 but i say unt but unto you i say and under the rest in thyatira as many as have not known have not this doctrine and which have not known the depths of satan as they speak i will put upon you none other burden and i've got to focus in on that phrase which have not known the depths of satan amen we'll just pray briefly our heavenly father as we are in your divine presence we ask that you come take the bread of life and feed it to us lord as i feel very comfortable in my spirit regardless of any weariness in mind or pain and body lord we feel very comfortable in our spirits that you desire to speak to your people and there's so many gathered here today that we have no concern as to mathematical requirements of two or three we have many lord we have no concern father as to whether or not we've gathered in your name we know that we've come to gather in your name now lord come speak to us we pray and in doing so may it help us encourage us and lift us up we ask this in the name of lord jesus christ amen amen you can be seated i don't know how many of you had visited brother john's office their trusted tool through the years but for many many years before they had repainted and remodeled a little bit there was a little sign a little handwritten note i think that johnny had put on the wall and it said invert always invert and that's my title today is invert always invert and if you're thinking well that's pretty strange i'll accept that but we'll help you we'll go through it a little bit maybe to understand the thought process and i think it's maybe a little catchy just to get you to think about these things but this invert always invert and we'll kind of explain even what that phrase means but i want to start with revelations chapter 2 verse 24 and so we're not really trying to take this particular scripture and give it a lot of context and and find a lot of depth to it but we're just wanting to take this phrase which have not known the depths of satan and kind of begin there because brother branham makes this statement in the thiatering church age this is chapter 6 when he writes the church age book he says let us first know what the depth of god is and the opposite will be true for the depth of satan so here's revelations chapter 2 verse 24 saying they have not known the depths of satan and instead of trying to figure out what are the depths of satan and just how deep does that go he say well let's just know what the depth of god is and as you know the depths of god well he's just saying the reverse or the inverse will be true for the depth of satan and he quotes ephesians chapter 3 verses 16 to 18 and it continues it says now according to these verses when a man experiences the depth of god in his life it is an actual personal experience of the spirit of god indwelling him and his mind is illuminated by the wisdom and knowledge of god through the word so this is the depths of god but the depth of satan will be that will be in that he will attempt to destroy this so when you recognize what the depths of god are and he kind of uses ephesians chapter three to uh identify once you know what the depth of god is then you can begin to understand what the depth of satan would be and he says the depth of satan the attack what he will try to do is to destroy the indwelling of god and the believer destroy god illuminating you by with the wisdom and knowledge of god through the word that's what god wants to do in indwell you once he dwells inside of you he wants to cause himself to increase and to grow and illuminate in you the depth of satan is to is the opposite to destroy that and he says he will always attempt to make a substitute for this reality of god how he do it he will take away the knowledge of the truth of god destroy the word by putting forth his own idea then he kind of refers he refers to genesis 3 yeah god said because in in the temptation of christ the temptation of the woman he will then substitute this is a very very weighty statement he will then substitute the personal christ in our spirits so this is what satan would want to do is substitute the personal christ in our spirits provides you with his own knowledge his own yeah if god said his own reasonings his own questionings to overthrow the power of god but what what brother branham has done in looking at the scripture revelations chapter 2 verse 24 and then expounding upon the spirit of god indwelling in you and your mind being illuminated by the wisdom and knowledge of god through the word he's saying first know what the depth of god is and the opposite or the inverse the reverse will be true for the depth of satan so what brother brahm does he's done is he's used inversion and inversion is the reversal of a position it's the changing the reversal of an order or even the the reverse of a relationship so if something is inverse then it's a re you could say reverse if it's inverse it's reverse or opposite or what is contrary so in this case brother baby says oh you say well they have not known the depth of satan but everyone said well first know what the depth of god is and so if we were to put some sort of it would all only it would have to be arbitrary but if we put some quantifier on it or try to qualify god or quantify god and say well god is 200 then satan would be the opposite of that right i mean he couldn't even he's he's the he's the contrary he's the different if god is light satan's darkness and so you see that god is this inverse relationship but the branham makes this statement the greatest battle ever fought satan's army brings diseases that's what satan is he's a destroyer satan's a destroyer god is a what a creator this is the inverse the opposite one is so it's like we're learning opposites maybe this is the best place to start for all of us no matter how old we are if something is above and below hot cold those are inverse relationships so satan's army brings diseases that's what satan is he's a destroyer satan the whole kingdom of satan is sickness death sorrow and frustrations and worry all of satan and he says god is lie faith joy peace over here amen this is an is creating a relationship satan on one hand is death sickness sorrow frustration and worry god is life faith joy peace over here these are this is one is positive one is negative and they're opposites of each other this is an inverse relationship and it's important maybe to think in terms of uh of why they're opposite and this uh this arrangement of satan's kingdom is god's kingdom uh it's gonna be real important to the thought that i'm trying to expound upon and so the title invert always invert invert means to put upside down or in the opposite position so we said inversion is the reversal of a position or order or a form or relationship to invert is to put something upside down or in the opposite position the opposite order or arrangement we always go alphabetical order to invert that would go from a to b would be z to a that would be the invert and we go if you read from left to right to do it the invert would be to read from right to left and so this is just what invert means and so when we use the phrase invert always invert it's a phrase that was used by carl jacoby he's a mathematician and it was just kind of it was a maxim it was a kind of a cliche to use to refer to an approach how to approach a difficult problem you're looking at a promise now i can't figure this out and you're asking yourself well what what's the answer and how can i solve this and say well instead of instead of approaching this way why don't you turn it around and work on it backwards uh maybe in um uh it's a maxim that's used within investments and i'm trying to remember the gentleman's name now but he's the partner there with uh now i can't remember the either of their names berkshire hathaway guy can you remember warren buffett his buddy i can't remember his name right now paul something uh he uses this phrase of invert always invert investing and instead of asking yourself um how will this make me rich you guys how will this make me poor or how can i lose a lot of money in this investment instead of kind of looking at what's the downside what's the negative what are the barriers and how this was inspired to me this very thought was inspired to me when i was looking into the word of god and i saw that the the opening of the word of god is the believer's joy and the pure joy that a christian is going to experience this through the word of god there's no other joy that we can have except through the word of god and and that we have this idea well i want to be happy and i want to and i want to have peace and i want to have joy and the lord dealt with me in this idea of invert instead of how can i have joy ask yourself what's keeping me from joy i want to have peace i want to have joy i want to have life i want to have happiness well maybe if it's been such something that's out of your reach and out of grasp it's a difficult problem then so we ask ourselves well not so much how can i have peace because many times we see it almost so plain in the word of god this is what it takes to have it if you have not obtained it maybe you need to ask yourself what's keeping me from it right and so that's the thought that uh the kind of the basis for even looking at this you approach a difficult problem by saying well uh let's address it backwards they say many difficult problems can be solved by addressing it backwards in other words you turn something upside down you could be looking at a picture you could be looking at a puzzle you could have a piece of the puzzle and you keep trying to make it fit and someone walks up and looks and says oh no you just need to turn it around like man i was i've been doing that for five minutes and they just kind of look at it differently they look at it from a different perspective sometimes it's because they come and stand on the other side you're looking at it one way and someone walks up from the other side and goes oh no it doesn't go there it goes right there wow it was a different perspective they're looking at it in reverse looking at it from an opposite vantage point this is something that this is personal for me that many times when i'm looking into the word of god and i'm wrestling with the difficult concept and i'm looking at things in the word of god and there's things that maybe you're reasoning out with somebody and you're fellowshipping in the word of god and you see something very clear in the message of the hour but then all of a sudden somebody kind of takes another statement says well what what about this one though and you look at it and it almost seems like oh wow this looks like it's saying almost the opposite of what what brother branham taught or this scene how does this how does this fit and the more you look at it and just kind of wait on it and ask god to quick into it you realize it actually becomes even better and more greater support for what you're looking at when you look at it from a different perspective you just turn it around you look at it and say well wait a minute that that contradicts that doesn't seem right well you might just be looking at it wrong turn it upside down turn it around wait on it see how it fits within the hole and my inspiration was this morning and and even to the subject of invert was i had been thinking about mind battles and how we all go through mind battles and i i'm saying that so i can get a lot of amens this morning preach about mind battles and everybody's like god bless you brother we love you well john when are you having him back was thinking about mind battles and then especially within the context of the greatest battle ever fought right and so we're all very familiar with that teaching and that tremendous sermon the greatest battle ever fought and so we have these mind battles and we're in this greatest battle ever fought and i realized that we can view our the warfare that we engage in these mind battles we can in view the greatest battle ever fought of these things that were taking place in our mind in a way that doesn't that brings discouragement in other words we're in the greatest battle ever fought we all have mind battles and where that ought to be comforting it actually becomes a great discouragement because like oh i'm fighting i'm war and this is difficult this is horrible i shouldn't be going through this i shouldn't be thinking these things i should be so far beyond this but and so i realized that there's this way that just knowing we're in a battle brings uh brings discouragement the battle's bad enough right but then all of a sudden like we're just in full-on fisticuffs with the devil and he says i can't believe you're fighting me like great you know here i thought i was doing the right thing i thought i was fighting i thought this was the right thing to do and now he's making me feel foolish for even finding and it just cascades and the domino effect hits us and we can become very very discouraged and so when we say the phrase and and and you can even acknowledge it we're all family today we've all said it before the devil is attacking my mind i'm having mind battles i'm really going through it the devil is just attacking me these thoughts are coming these things are bombarding me and when that happens we're made to feel very vulnerable like the mind is just a target it's always available this whenever he wants to come back and so it makes us feel very weak uh we feel wrong because we're engaged in these mind battles and we feel very we're on the defensive because something attacks us and we get our guard up or something comes in our minds and we feel very vulnerable or something takes place and we're we're feeling very weak just because our minds are uh it seems as if they're always available always available for something to drop in there some thought to come and we're told that you can't stop them you can't stop the thought from coming right but you can kick it out like you can't stop the birds from you know coming and sitting down but you don't have to give them enough time to build a nest you know the thought comes in and settles in for a little bit and it starts getting comfortable you just say get out of there right because you don't want it to find a home or make an abode in your mind and so i want to use a different perspective i want to use invert this you say oh we're there and i'm going through it i'm in a battle in my mind and i'm fighting and the devil's bombarding me and the devil's attacking me and i've got these thoughts and i've got that thought let's invert that amen we are not the victim all right let's think about a little bit differently we are not the ones being attacked but i want to take this and this would be my thesis that i'll just amplify for the time that we have together today the word is the aggressor in this war like so we're in this battle oh but my mind is being attacked i'm in this warfare i'm being attacked and you feel vulnerable you feel weak you feel like you're a wick a victim but if you invert that satan's attack may be him fighting back against the word satan's satan's uh his his his attack may be him defending against the word that begins to advance within our minds as we begin to grow as christians and begin to feed upon the word of god as we begin to experience another reality and the word begins to illuminate our minds and and something comes up and now we're fighting and now we're battling with now we're wrestling and we begin to think oh i'm being attacked well have you ever thought that maybe the word is attacking the devil the word is attacking some stronghold that's been in your mind you've had this belief system your whole life you've had these tendencies your whole lives you have these lies that recited in your conscience subconscious you have all these things that maybe exist in your spirit and the word begins to increase and what to push out and so one day it comes when it wakes up an old complex or wakes up an idea wakes up a belief wakes up an affection or an infinity or a memory it says all right but it's time to go it's time to leave and the word is serving these eviction papers and the devil says no i don't want to go i want to stay here and you start fighting i'm sure you can relate to this that there's things that you go your whole life well i never fought like this before i never struggle with this why am i fighting now you never fought before right right it's really good before it just lived there rent free in your head did whatever it wanted to do made you do whatever you want to do but now all of a sudden there's something else alive that say no no don't do it don't go there don't think that don't say that about that person don't think negative don't think this don't think that and now you're actually fighting now you're saying no i don't want to be that way i don't want to live that way i don't want to have these thoughts i don't experience these things no i don't want to always be give up i don't always want to be melancholy you don't always want to be depressed i don't always want to be undergoing oh i want to overcome i wanted to have joy i want to have peace i want to have life and now you're fighting for it amen and so that's my idea of of the inversion invert always invert i feel like i've made the point we could go we could go get french laundry and get in like get in line early and get our name in so we don't have to wait two hours this afternoon i guess they call it the laundry now that goes to show how much of an old timer i am i remember when it's called the french laundry but that's that's my thought i'm just going to drive a home today amen he's going to drive a home that's my thought i was reading in acts chapter 17 as it talks about paul and them coming and they came into a town and they were declaring declaring the word of the lord and so as they came listen to what they said and when they they were seeking them and jason the house of jason and they sought to bring them out to the people and the jews were all moved but envy it says and they're wanting to take paul and silas and and beat them up and then it says in verse six and when they found them not they drew jason in certain brethren under the rulers of the city so here's jason and all the brothers this is this is send the light there and they're being dragged out into the into the street since jason and a few of his brothers i'm not prophesying any doom here but they get dragged out into the street and it says these that cut have returned and said to the religious crime these that have turned the world upside down are come hither also think about it now could you imagine at jason and the brethren are all going through it they're being bombarded and they're and they feel vulnerable and they feel attacked and they're a little bit scared about the things that are happening but this is what the city had to say about jason these brethren and paul and size these guys have turned the world upside down you feel like your world's getting turned upside down and you flipped upside down no no no no no your world's not turned upside down now it's right side up and it's the complexes and the fears and the doubts and it's the devil who's being dangled over hell upside down think about it the believers were said that they are the ones that turned the world upside down i'm not worried about the coronavirus turning my world upside down i'm not worried about uh economics turning to my world upside down i'm not worried about politics fashion entertainment sports you name it that ain't gonna turn my world upside down i'm gonna turn the world upside down because that's what a believer is called to do we're inverting him he said oh i feel like my world's been turned upside down maybe it's right side up maybe god's putting things into place maybe god's finally straightened something out in your line you're like man i i don't i feel a little crooked like no you're walking straight now you always walk with a lean and now god strange up things start to look different i said there's a phenomena these things are you guys are man you guys are fresh today this is i feel good i feel like you're just pulling me all over the place there's a they've done this and they've taken glasses and you can put you can wear glasses they'll actually turn what you're looking at upside down so you stand here you put glasses on and also in the room is upside down give it enough time and the brain will actually learn to flip it back that's true because that's the way the mind works the mind's gonna always flip it around so maybe you what the devil did is he put a pair of glasses on your head you started seeing the world upside down for a while because it's you're looking through the devil's eyes the devil's explanation the devil's circumstance look at everything and after a while your mind accepts it flips it and just keeps the glasses on [Music] and it's and your mind now has taken flipped and god just wants to take the glory you don't need the devil's view anymore you only keep having your world flip-flop back and forth he wants to heal your mind he wants to straighten things out so that's what i mean by invert always invert i'm going through the worst battle of my life this i've never been attacked like this before maybe the words the one that's on the attack amen amen and the devil is fighting back i'm going to look at these thoughts in greatest battle ever fought brother branham says this he says how did grant take richmond talking about civil war times he says how did grant take richmond just as he come to it this taking of richmond did not occur because they were there in washington dc and the mayor of richmond showed up there went to the pentagon and said i don't know existed at the time but let's just say went to the white house and said you know i'm just going to surren here's the keys to the city mr lincoln uh grant here's my surrender papers no grant had to come to richmond and it was in it in his path he says just does he come to it that's how he took richmond he says that's how god soldiers take sin sickness just as they come to it that sickness didn't come to you you've come to it that changes everything right you're not being picked on you're not being bullied something's happened and you've advanced you've come to a place where sin and sickness has met you but you've come to it that's the way they overcome their doubts and fears and things doubts and fears are things that are uncovered and stirred up let's not think that we're necessarily being ambushed or attacked let's think that the word has uncovered it the word has exposed it the word has identified it he says when one rises they chop them down move out of the way so this is the language that he's using he's not he hasn't painted this picture that the believers over here huddled in a corner that's okay i can drop out of camera view i'll get right back up huddled over here in the corner and shrieking because fear is coming and death is coming and sickness is coming but no we're walking right right we're walking in the christian life fear pops up chop it away we're advancing in the word of god doubt comes up chop it away you're serving guard you're going forward sickness comes god i believe you're my healer i believe that you can deliver me we're not we haven't built these fortifications and we're all just huddled in the basement hoping that this tornado passes that's not what the believer is doing the believers on the attack and when he uses this image of how grant took richmond the capture of richmond there's actually this phrase like grant took richmond i don't think it's one we use anymore actually my advice would try to just avoid any civil war era phrases completely uh but uh this this phrase like grant took richmond it means it's decided decidedly very clear that's a phrase it was just a cliche anybody ever heard it used before i'm not trying to date anybody here but this was just a phrase that was commonly used in writings and things and uh over a hundred years ago but it was like hey like grant i'm gonna do this like grant took richmond very quickly very decidedly but what's interesting is when brother branham says how did grant take richmond the fall of richmond was preceded by the siege of petersburg and this was the seas you think oh like grant took richmond boy it just was vanquished it was just destroyed it was decided quickly and actually when they came in there on in richmond on april 3rd it fell in one day they conquered it in one day but the siege of petersburg lasted for 292 days from june 15 1864 to april 2nd 1865 and during the siege of petersburg the armies were entrenched over 40 miles 40 miles of entrenchments there was over 70 000 casualties over that 10-month period so over 10 month period over 70 000 casualties entrenched over 40 miles they said it was some of the most uh sophisticated systems of earthworks ever seen in battle because you have this long siege and they're building these earthworks and they're building these trenches and they're building this siege warfare and these were strongholds and you have petersburg entrenched you have the union army a sieging at lane siege and everything is entrenched around it it's a very long drawn out protracted battle because there's a stronghold and here's the union army coming to push it out of the stronghold coming to to overcome it and to conquer it and saint petersburg was surrendered at dawn on april 3rd so 292 days finally it comes to end at the dawn on april 3rd and now once this petersburg which had been the stronghold that was holding out and the union army is attacking it once it finally gives way say petersburg falls the same day richmond is conquered why because it was the army kept marching it found a stronghold it may have taken a while but they finally decided defeated it but now they come up against richmond and richmond was something that was next right it wasn't sitting back and letting uh the the the confederacy bring the battle to the union and and on the defensive and running here and running there and trying to find the best ground and trying to find a way um to to to to figure out what's taking place and sabotage no the army was going forward the truth was marching on we could say and here's the here's the truth going forward the truth going forward maybe sometimes there's the siege a 292-day trench warfare but as soon as that failed the next one was richmond he says that's how the believers take sin that's how they overcome doubt fear in things is when one rises up they chop it down amen brother branham says in greatest battle ever thought take the word of god and cut your way through every doubt amen cut your way through i mean it's between you and a destination you're moving along and it pops up you're going somewhere so you chop your way through it amen again the images you're not sitting here just being bombarded that's good you're not back in the you're not back in the in the corner and the ropes just trying to dodge and cover up and and whether this barrage of punches no you're going forward he says sure that's it that's the next job let's get it done right next thing i'm going to do is get away from my doubts cut it down my next job is get away from my frustrations notice how this is advancement this is progress you say oh well i had this is me just kind of amplifying this he says oh i had this i had all these doubts and and i was fighting these doubts and now i've gotten rid of the doubts and now i have frustrations well brother brahms in some way validated your struggle he's kind of said you know what this is what happens once you get rid of doubts you have to get rid of frustrations and so we might go from one battle to the next to the next about to the next and we can get discouraged but i said no no no no you're conquering things you're advancing you're going forward you say i got rid of all my doubts and now i'm frustrated good doubts are dead frustrations are next just like you chopped down away and you got to overcome doubt you overcame this and you overcame that now it's time to overcome the next one he says if my senses tell me well you feel bad that's the next thing to do is cut that away man i got rid of my doubts i got rid of my frustrations and now i don't feel good well get rid of that that's the next thing he says you know my conscience tells me brother branham well you might as well cut that thing away too that's good he says you ain't going to get no farther than that why because you're you're going forward doubts come up fight it out with doubt maybe there's a siege maybe 292 days without once you kill it what's the next one it's frustration kill that next one i don't feel good kill that well my conscience he's saying just go one by one by one because that's that's the next battle he says you'll get no further than that just get your next job done take off your coat bear right into it just keep on going amen one objective i'm going to win amen i can't lose i'm going to win that's inversion right we think that whenever we get into battle i want you to think very this is very simple very very simple but we think because we're losing we're in a battle the reason why one of the reasons why that becomes so significant in our minds is whenever there's a contest or conflict whenever there's a battle whenever we play a game and we play games with our children or we have an athletic contest you have a winner and you have a loser and what what the battle the fear the threat the battle holds over says i'm in a battle i'm in a war and we think we can lose and that's what causes the the consternation and the troubles and the difficulties and the fear and the worry i'm in a fight i'm in a fight what if i lose you can't right amen so instead of thinking that a battle is a is a is the chance that you might lose every battle is guaranteed victory he said i'm going to win i can't lose i'm going to win so if you're in a fight you can already chalk one up in the win column amen you could just do it you say oh i'm in a fight we won again i got another victory put another notch in my belt give me another give me another championship trophy because this is another victory every battle is evidence and proof of another victory he says i'm going to win i can't lose i'm going to win i'll say this i i this may not be different to you but for me it was very different it's a very different way of viewing the greatest battle ever fought and the one thing that i this is many years ago the lord had quickened it to me for me personally as i realized that the greatest battle ever fought we know that brother brown is very clear about the greatest battle ever fought is in the mind but he was saying he was giving us the location of it but he was also identifying that the mind wasn't just the battleground the mind was the ground that was being battled for so it's not just a battle in the mind it's actually a battle for the mind we think well god chose my heart he has my heart i guess my mind is just going to be possessed by devils and be a battleground of devils and a war and a fight no that's not the that's not what god brother bannon was trying to teach is that as long as he's in your heart it doesn't matter what's in your mind uh it was a it was a question of god chose your soul seals that off by the baptist the holy ghost and now satan has access to your mind and the there's still a battle and a battle is for the purpose of victory and if you're going to win and you can't lose the greatest battle ever fought in your mind is guaranteed victory so the battle is not without a purpose we have something to overcome and we have we have something overcome for a reason the greatest battle ever fought is progress because the soul having been sealed it now advances to this place of the mind the seed of thoughts and feelings and affections it's now coming as a matter of progress to the place in the mind so that there can be possession of it and so the battle is not just in the mind it's for the mind some of the most significant and greatest battles ever fought throughout history was they did not choose a neutral site that was without consequence and they meet on the battlefield they merely go home it was done to increase something that this particular area this particular plot of land this particular field or this place had importance it had a significance to it and it was a means of possessing there wasn't a neutral battlefield site in all wars that everyone just kind of shows up and they have their their world war on these fields and the winner goes home and goes back to their country they fight for ground they want to possess they fight for land that is in question they fight over things that the the the ownership is in dispute and this mind the devil is fighting their mind wanting to take ownership of it and now we have the greatest greatest battle ever fought in our minds but not just in our minds but for your mind amen the bible says in genesis 22 17 that thy seed this promise to abraham which we are the royal seed of abraham thy seed shall possess the gate of his enemies this is the promise we will possess the gate of our enemies we have in our minds these senses these five gates imagination conscience memory reason and affection if you just want to say those are the gates of the spirit of your your biggest enemy because who's your biggest enemy yourself you're your biggest enemy i'm not your biggest enemy you are your biggest enemy [Laughter] i i know i know what you meant by michael they say who's your biggest sinner you are no yourself right right that's what you are your biggest enemy i i look in the mirror there's my biggest enemy well he's got gates he's got imagination conscience memory memory reason and affection those are gates in my spirit i got gates to my body and you shall possess the gates of your enemy you're going to bring any sense contrary to the word of god under subjection to the word any thought any imagination any consciousness any reason any affection everything subject to the word of god you shall possess the gate of your enemies it says in genesis chapter 49 verse 19 it says god a troop shall overcome him interesting how it's phrased it says that he's going to be fought against the troops shall overcome him but he shall overcome at the last you follow the history of god and it says prophecy as it's going out over these children this prophecy from this the father here prophesies that god would be warriors and at times it would look like god is conquered but ultimately they'll be victorious they're going to be at times of seeming to be conquered and beaten down and downtrodden going through it but he shall overcome at the last this is the prophecy that they were going to be warriors i use it to speak to you that there's times that it may seem like you're going through something and it's going to end a certain way it's going to be a certain way you may feel that you've lost you may feel that oh i've lost this time i've lost this person i've lost this situation i've lost this opportunity and i've been beat up and turned upside down and everything's everything's fallen to pieces and nothing else nothing has worked out good but you shall be victorious or overcome at last and to so much soul that we have a promise that says all things work together for the good wait uh what all things work together for the good even we could say of dad the time that the troops overcame gad god somehow uses those losses and uses those circumstances and uses those frustrations and uses those doubts and uses everything we've gone through and uses it for good amen that's right as paul even concludes in romans 8 37 nay and all these things we are more than conquerors through him that loved us i love how we chose to say this we are more than conquerors i i believe that this is exactly what is in it should be said or is intended when he says all things work together for the good verse 28 saying all things work together for the good someone said well but what about this and what about that he said yeah all things work together for the good. and he says so in all these things what were all these things tribulation distress nakedness persecution famine peril sword i mean he has a pretty good list right he's saying in all these things well what about the sword oh you're more than a conqueror what about peril more than a conqueror what about persecution more than a conqueror what about famine more than a conqueror what about tribulation more than a conqueror and what he's saying is that you're not going to be a survivor maybe we maybe we would have felt i mean maybe we'd be kind of comforted with our condition if paul said nay and all these things you shall get by and all these things you will survive and so we kind of get we could get this image in our minds of someone just kind of crawling out of this pit of tribulation i made it i'm here this famine is getting me i'm slipping away but i survived i always say no you're gonna be more than a conqueror i know what you're gonna i wish i could just jump up on top of this you're just gonna ride up over the top of it it means to gain a surpassing victory there is no overtime they're not going to penalty kicks it's not decided on a tiebreaker this is a surpassing victory what's incredible is at the end of the day the devil's going to look back and try to look at the scoreboard and he's like well at least it was what yeah i didn't even score a point i got shut out through 6 000 years how did that work he's gonna think well at least it was close wait they pitched a perfect game i never got on base every inning was an immaculate inning what are you kidding me they're not he can't figure out how that's gonna work but that's exactly what's going to happen he can't say scoreboard on anything there's nothing that he can say well at least i got you here at least i got you there there's this moment of realization when he's kicked into the lake of fire when he's gonna say at least i got you wait a minute what's he doing there everything works for the good ultimately you will gain surpassing victory because in all these things we are more than conquerors we're inverting the greatest battle ever fought the devil's attacking my mind the devil's i'm in a fight i'm in a battle i'm in a war in my mind well brother banner says you had to open the channel first you talked about this being born again by the baptist the holy ghost you open up that channel faith comes in you're sealed he says you've got to get the soldier the holy spirit placed at the battlefront that takes god's word he is the word and he stands there and there's nothing going to stop it then there's nothing so notice what these elements of the greatest battle ever fought is the only the place that he puts you is that you have your mind is the battleground so that's really your involvement amen and satan's there and the word is there and so the fight that's taking place you're you're subject to this fight you're experiencing the fight but guess why there's a fight the word is there fighting there's the bell rang because the holy spirit showed up right the fight was on and they blew the whistle and they kicked off the game and they dropped the puck why because the word was there and the word is our warrior you've got to get the soldier soldiers fight right you want you want to know why there's a fight going on you got a soldier there soldiers fight and because there's a and the word there the soldiers there in the battle in your mind and he's waging warfare against any thought contrary to the word and this fight takes place this lag comes up the situation comes up all these things come and you start engaging in conflict invert and realize wait a minute why in the world is there a battle to begin with why shouldn't i just accept that and be happy with it and go along with it because there's something raging against it the word is standing there saying nope i'm a fighter i'm not gonna let this come in exodus 15 3 the lord is a man of war the lord is his name notice how it says the lord is a man of war if this is the greatest battle ever fought the lord is there he's a part of this he says the lord is a man of war says jehovah is a hero in battle jehovah is always a winner amen never lost a battle never been defeated no matter how dark it looks or how bad it gets and no matter how the world tries to twist it and and turn it around the god always wins just think of how the world would describe the death of jesus christ hanging there on the cross and how it would respond to the disciples how do you realize this master this teacher look at him look how dark this is look how depraved this is look how awful this is look what kind of death this is but yet it's the greatest victory isaiah 42 13 the lord shall go forth as a mighty man he shall stir up jealousy like a man of war he shall cry yea roar this is a lion roaring he shall prevail against his enemies the lord is a mighty man of war he is a man of war who has this jealousy of fervency and a passion he's going to roar and he shall prevail against his enemies remember we're taking this you've got to get the soldier the holy spirit placed on the battlefront the soldier the holy spirit is on the battlefront where's the battlefront it's in your mind and this is what he is a man of war a mighty man one who prevails against his enemies one that cannot be defeated the battle in your mind is a signal the devil's about to lose why because the battle is the lord's he showed up in your mind not to spectate he's not there as an observer he doesn't have like the red cross helmet on or you know sitting there kind of looking at everything oh okay well let's just i'm just here observing i'm neutral got the you in helmet on right so they're saying we're not involved we're not fighting i'm just kind of here checking out how mark's doing oh my goodness you're getting beat up oh man you're really getting him good i'm gonna go tell his pastor his pastor can can really work him over because you're getting no it you're it's you're the mind you're sitting there and they're just and the and the lord shows him he's like let's do this he's rolling up his sleeve he says i got this brother mark don't worry i got this and he's fighting for you it said in first samuel 17 47 and all this assembly shall know that the lord saveth not with sword and spear in other words he doesn't save by man's efforts for the battle is the lord's and he will give you into our hands notice what the testimony is it's not because we're good with the sword it's not because i show up and i'm willing to fight but it's the lord's battle and you will be delivered into my hands these very phrases the lord is a man of war the lord is a mighty man he's like a man of war he prevails against his enemies in this phrase and samuel for the battle is the lord just saying the events of warfare are holy in god's power there's not a battle that's taking place on this earth that god hasn't permitted if he wanted to stop it he'd stop it every battle every fight every engagement every conflict is under his direction he allows it if he allows it it's going to work some good for god's people it is the lord's war amen amen so the greatest battle ever fought remember we're inverting this we're turning it upside down we're wanting to look at it from a different perspective you've been over there looking at working on the greatest battle ever fought puzzle and what i'm and you're just looking at it this way and i'm walking up from the opposite direction this morning amen i'm saying have you ever thought about it this way that's right and i just want to take it kind of turn it around just so you can look at it a little bit differently because the greatest battle ever fought is not you versus satan that's right right on in this corner you know poor wretched miserable you on this corner the former archangel michael the great prince the one who's the this mighty conqueror the one that was over here doing this and doing that riding forth and a white horse and and these different just all the ways he's described in scriptures and he deceived the woman and he actually caused angels to fall in heaven and just and now and just think of that announcing yeah and you're over there going uh uh in my 28 years i don't know if i can handle this guy who's been doing this since before time began that's not the battle right amen it's not you versus satan in your mind but it's god versus satan for your mind now tell me who's going to win the word versus satan for your mind who's going to win the word's going to win in exodus chapter 14 verses 13 to 15. this is a they're leaving egypt just think about how awesome that was we're leaving egypt they're taking everything they're taking their neighbors gold they're they're headed out this is a victory after hundreds of years of oppression and bondage they're free from slavery they're free from sin they're free from all their oppressors they're going forward and then in this great victory they come up against the red sea i want you to think about this is we're inverting you can think oh man was there some lack of planning on god's part hey did i mean didn't you didn't you have any kind of premonition at all that this was going to happen you're going to run out of egypt we're leaving and there's a giant ocean there's a red sea that's boarding and keeping you from getting to where you need to go i mean it seems like did you think this through well god did right when god got there he didn't build a bridge when they got there god hadn't already um provided some sort of land mass for them to get over it because i want you to think about it if there was a bridge for them to cross there was a bridge for their enemy to cross there was land that they could cover there was land for their enemy to cover so it says in these verses here and moses said unto the people fear ye not stand still and see the salvation of the lord which he will show to you today for the egyptians whom you have seen today you shall see them again no more forever the lord shall fight for you and ye shall hold your peace and the lord said unto moses wherefore christ thou unto me speak unto the children of israel that they go forward amen amen what this god was saying why are you stopping you may hear the church you may see the dust you may know your enemy's coming you've got a job to do you've got a destination don't stop turn around and figure out how you're going to fight this guy coming after you the battle is the lord's you've got one job keep going forward and as long as you're in the line of duty if something comes up you got to worry about that guy but if you ever stop and turn around and go back you're picking a fight that you don't need to fight you're running into a fight the guy says i've got this keep going leave your past behind move forward don't don't retreat don't turn around don't go back and pick a fight with the devil that's a defeated fall that's vanquished they're behind you said you see him today you'll see him no longer he says keep going forward because even this situation the fact that they had the enemy bearing down on them at the red sea was the result of progress not oppression right amen they were in this battle because of progress they were in this battle not in in the throes of egyptian bondage but they were in this battle because of progression they were no longer under the oppression they had advanced to the red sea and now god arranges this terrible moment so that israel could have their last conflict with egypt he says you're not going to see them anymore forever amen now let's just think about it you leave you your people have been in bondage for 400 years in slavery and god brings you out with the mighty hand but you know you just left one of the mightiest nations in the world with the mighty mighty mighty army and chariots and horsemen and spears and a pharaoh who just lost his son because of the vindicated word that came into your midst and you go and you cross the red sea and then you go and you make it into the wilderness and anytime you hear a rumble you start looking back to the horizon did pharaoh finally have enough is he coming after me is he coming to get me so what does the lord do he says i'm going to i'm going to do i'm going to provide this conflict i'm going to bring you to this red sea he says speak and go forward and what does god do he opens up the red sea and the children of israel cross on dry land and then once they're getting across and even as it's dramatized in the movie that we've i think we've all seen the ten commandments pharaoh's army is catching up and it looks like they're going to catch him looks like and now what do we do what do we do god's like i got to wait till the last one gets in you got to wait till the last chariot get get in here hurry get into the red seat now you're in and the waves crush their enemy and they're able to witness all the chariots all the horsemen all the best warriors of all egypt are now at the bottom of the red sea and i can go forward and never have to worry about an egyptian chariot coming after me again isn't that the beauty and the grace of god that he creates this final conflict the situation coming don't worry the lord's going to fight this one for you and he's going to defeat him in such a way to where you never have to worry about an egyptian horseman again when you think about this the fighting is not an act of defense it's an offensive act let me use it this way and maybe just try to share a few things as we're trying to bring this to a close it's it's actually an act of you enforcing redemption claims i said to give it up instead of surrendering you're fighting because something tells you you have a right to that something's telling you that you shouldn't have to put up with that you should have to go through that you should have to deal with that you don't have to resign to believe it you don't have to accept it you're fighting sickness you're fighting doubt you're fighting frustration because those aren't your promises amen and so it's an offensive act of enforcing redemption claims notice how paul spoke to timothy first timothy 1 18 this charge i committed to these son timothy according to the prophecies that went before on thee that thou by them mightiest war a good warfare the charge that's been committed and the prophecies that have went before him he is to use to war a good warfare war means to make a military expedition to lead soldiers to war to war a good warfare that means military service to wage a war a campaign so paul is not telling timothy that look be a good administrator timothy be good be a good administrator in the churches he said no this word has been given to you this charge i've committed to these prophecies that went out before you because you are going to be waging war you're going to be setting forth on a military expedition this is military service you're going to be leading soldiers to war you are not on the food network having a picnic but you are you are in this battle and you're leading him into war and so you're going to war a good warfare and it signals to us this is a battle that's why we're given a helmet this is the battle that's why we're given a sword this is the battle that's why we're given a shield and that's why all of our armor is armored for soldiers who are advancing not retreating we have nothing to cover our backside except god and i'm grateful for that because the lord he shall fight your battles you go forward i've given you the word to go forward i've got you i'm covering your weaknesses i'm covering your backside if there's an old enemy that pops up i'm here to defeat him i'm here to bury him in the red sea i'm so glad he brings us through it amen amen so then bringing us through the red sea our enemies are defeated not around it or over it to keep them alive but destroys them in it it picks it back up in chapter 6 verse 12 fight the good fight of faith this is what he's telling timothy to do fight the good fight of faith the good fight of faith is a fight fight the good fight of faith amen my sister said one time i'm just fighting the good faith it's like no you don't want to fight the good fight you want faith you want to fight the good fight of faith lay hold on eternal life whereunto thou are also called and has professed a good profession before many witnesses fight means to enter a contest it means to strive to endeavor his to contend with adversaries to fight with difficulties to to war with dangers it's already been we've it's already we've already been told beforehand the greatest battle ever fought it's not do you just get home at the end of a long day and laying in your bed and it's like oh i'm just whipped i'm all beat out and putting cucumbers on her eyes you know and drinking mint tea and just saying oh boy this is so tough this is a battle this is a war fight enter a contest contend with adversaries fight with difficulties war with dangers the good fight the good battle to contend fight strive endeavor with great zeal against enemies fight the good fight i'm an endeavor i'm gonna lay hold i'm gonna persevere i'm gonna profess lay hold it's the act of taking possession to lay hold of eternity i'm gonna overtake i'm going to tame i'm going to seize upon with my hands i'm going to get dusty with it i'm going to grab a hold of it i'm going to fight this fight because the battle is the lord's he's going to deliver it into my hands i'm advancing i'm going forward amen second corinthians chapter 10 verses 3 and 4 for though we walk in the flesh we do not war after the flesh using a language that soldiers understand war for the weapons of our warfare so it's not just saying it to timothy now he's telling the corinthian church the weapons of our warfare are not carnal but mighty through god to the pulling down of strongholds we can lay siege on petersburg amen once it falls we can advance to richmond amen because we have weapons that through god can pull down strongholds strongholds a castle or a fortress anything fortifying a position against you it doesn't matter how fortified a position is against you you could go to the doctor and the doctor could come in and just have a stack i hope sister cheryl doesn't mind good things she's not all right you could go into the doctor and you're waiting for your test results right a doctor comes out and says well we found out this is what's wrong with you and this is what you can expect and these are your symptoms and this is what you're gonna have to go through and it doesn't matter how high this stack gets you can say oh well isn't that neat buy his stripes i'm healed doesn't matter how how big the strongholds are how fortified they are how deep the earthworks are how long it's been there it doesn't matter how big or how tall you can just say oh that's interesting i've got a weapon that's mighty through god to the pooling down of strongholds no matter how big how long they've been there you could come to me and say brother aaron i did a 23andme i did a dna test my family's had this problem for 4 000 years my lineage has been traced back you remember that one in the bible had a bad temper he's my gregory grandfather and we've all had tempers it doesn't matter hey that's great we've got a word that can tear that stronghold down there's no dna there's no family history there's no symptom there's no demon possession so great that the word isn't more powerful over it no matter what it is anything fortifying a position against you the word can tear down praise the lord the greatest battle ever fought it's a mind battle because god's taking back your mind he has your soul he wants your mind too i mean don't think for a second that god was just happy having the soul i was like well i've got the soul and he's down there in your soul and the inside of the inside and the inner man looking up at satan chilling in in your in your mind maxing like michael jackson chilling like a villain just hanging out there in your mind you know just loving it and and and god's just happy to kind of be there in the soul saying i've got the soul he took your soul now that your salvation is secured he's like let's go do work i got a job to do let's go further let's advance and he could have just said hey your soul's healed who cares about your body being sick he says buy your stripes i'm healed what did he do on the cross he atoned for every single bit of it he didn't just say well i'm purchasing your salvation of your soul but by my stripes your body is also healed say well i'm going through this there's a promise i'm going through this there's a promise the atonement is for soul spirit and body you say oh well i'm so alone i'm lonely and this happened everyone's rejected me and i feel i don't have any close friendships and i feel like i don't have anyone to love me i feel like i'm not part of a family and you can say you could look to the atonement where he says my god my god why is thou forsaken me he even went so far to even achieve deliverance and redemption for the lonely every single aspect every single part of it is in the atonement because god wants to take your mind amen amen brother man the greatest battle of fox says restore means to return to the former owner or to bring back to the former state or condition of state of condition he says and we can enforce a redemption a claim to be restored we can enforce a claim to be restored therefore any battle that's raging in your mind you could look at it as evidence of the work of a restoration amen every battle is restoration and progress you ever go to a museum or you go somewhere a historical site and says restoration in progress i think we've seen some of the restorative works of art that have been done in europe over the years where somebody felt like this painting needs to touch up and they completely destroyed it well we're not a work of art that just some amateur is going to come by and try to touch up the original artist the original architect the original engineer the one that painted your perfect picture is coming along and repainting everything the devil's marred he was restoring everything this is a work of restoration this is taking back what was lost you say oh i've lost my mind you haven't lost your mind god's winning it back amen you're not going crazy god's winning it back you're winning it back fought by thought by thought you have a thought and whereas before you might have come subject to it now every thought is being exposed every idea is being exposed satan's being exposed you're not losing your mind the devil's just trying to grab a hold of a part of it a little bit more tight a little bit more tight because the word is bearing down on it and our captain the lord of hosts is saying satan your time is up your days are over your time of torment your time of oppression your time of hiding it's coming to an end and the song is bearing down upon the devil and then i said no no why have you come to torment me before my time and the god is safe and there is satan you get summer get away from him he's being exposed and cast out the greatest battery of fossils the brains of the army lays and its captains the intelligence well there's our captain the word he's the intelligence even showing us that the next thing that has stepped into this church is the intelligence it's christ he himself the intelligence that steps down into this church that tells me that there's a warrior a captain that's on the battlefield that the the intelligence of the army the brains of the army is in the captain i've got the soldier the captain christ the word on the battleground there's the one that knows how to fight it wasn't even a fight before you couldn't even call it a skirmish you couldn't even get a shot off what what what happened before the holy ghost came you just you didn't even have a weapon the devil comes and says smoke that and stop smoking it yeah devil says lust that i'm less than devil come says doubt that i'm doubting it right that's all that ever happened right you didn't have a fight now that the soul has been regenerated now that you're sealed with the holy ghost now you have another mind on the inside the devil says smoke that and god says don't do that you're like i'm not going to do it right amen now the devil says doubt that there's something else inside says believe that you're like i'm gonna believe it there's something else there and then maybe you can get in a battle in a wrestling in a fight but realize now you've got the captain brother man says then he says the thing you have to overcome is yourself your idea your thing i'm glad you said your thing because then whatever your thing is it's in there that's right yourself your idea your thing and surrender yourself to him so that there's the outcome to me this is just this is how i'm just invert and i know i'm looking a little bit differently maybe but here's the outcome the greatest battle ever fought so we picture i'm fighting the devil we're going to win this and actually what you where the outcome that's determinative in this is not between you and the devil but between you and the lord amen you're saying just surrender to him so we've kind of run out there in the battlefield come here devil i got you i'm gonna get you come here and you're gonna fight the devil and the lord's going come here come here get back here come over here that's right you little guy you think you can do this come on get back here and you're there yipping and yapping at the devil and he says no surrender to me come back here because it's only through christ we're taught that we're more than a match for the devil amen if we're going to run up headlong into a fight with the devils and i'll come back here what does the scripture say the scripture does not just say resist the devil and he'll flee what does the whole verse say submit yourselves therefore to god resist the devil and he'll flee the success was never your resisting the success was your submitting resistance without submission is futile right and so you have to submit and once submitted well then any effort to release is not you anymore it's the lord and so we come back to him and we surrender to him and we yield to him and he says he overcome for you overcome yourself your idea overcome your thing overcome surrender yourself to him he overcome for you he knows the way we don't i want you to look at it this way if god could allow you to do so whatever you're going through in your life you can look at it i'm battling i'm fighting i'm struggling this is a great warfare that's taking place and say the battle is evidence that the captain is on the in battlefield events made clear by prophecy brother brown says but god does his own interpreting of his word he promised this thing and then he does it himself he gives himself the interpretation of it because he makes himself known in that hour how far the body of christ is advanced from the feet to the head think about that would think of what's symbolized in that the feet is advanced from the feet to the head and he talked about the headship coming to the body is vindication that the rapture is at hand so think about where we are spiritually headship headstone capstone the body of christ is advanced from the feet this isn't defeat age this is an ankle age this is an elbow age this isn't shoulder age this isn't just nose or eye age this is the mind this is the intelligence stepping into that body he says the body of christ is advanced think of that advance from the feet to the head maybe i'm bringing in some of these modern these spiritual happenings and these great events that have transpired in the open of the word so that we can realize make this connection that these very truths that we hold to be so precious to us they're there for our full deliverance and our participation in the fullness of the atonement and if the body of christ has advanced from the feet to the head then there's deliverance in your mind there's victory in your mind and you're thinking for a member of that body and it's evidence that the lord has advanced from your footsteps of faith to possess a point to possess a promise to now to the head to where god wants to completely deliver us brown when he's preaching the breach and he's describing the events of revelations chapter five he says oh would it not be a glorious thing if our sinful thoughts tonight could be laid aside long enough to accept in him he says he would advance all the way from glory to night to make himself known to anyone i want you to think i'd taken out some of the other statements and things in this but what i was wanting to point out and identify here is its advancement its progress the battle that the children of israel faced in exodus chapter 14 was because of progress not oppression they had advanced to the red sea the enemy was pursuing them because they were leaving them amen that's when the lord says i'll fight for you the battle many times is not us wilting in the corner being barraged and bombarded but it's the word leading us and we advance to doubt and it chopped down we advanced to frustration and chopped it down we advanced to sickness we chopped it down we've advanced to conscience we've chopped it down we're advancing and look at this type this beautiful things this truth that we hold so dear the body of christ is advanced from the feet to the head this isn't retreat this isn't going backwards this isn't stagnating and being stale and we're being sieged and we're being bombarded he says wouldn't it be wonderful glorious if he would advance all the way from glory tonight to make himself known to anyone the lamb advancing from glory for intercessions to make claims now for his redemption it's the lamb that purchased your redemption and he bought it through the shedding of his blood but he's declared to be what when he advances to take possession of it not a lamb but a lion amen revelations 5 5 and one of the elders seth and me weep not behold the lion of the tribe of judah the use of lion what is the bible says he's going to roar he roars he shall prevail against his enemies he's like a man of war he shall go forth as a mighty man we think oh he's a lamb he's a lamb he's a lamb that was slain and and we're and we kind of keep that image in our mind but the announcement is not just this meek bloody lamb but it's the lion of the tribe of judah he's roared he's a mighty man he's prevailed against his enemies the lion hath prevailed the root of david half prevailed that means conquered have prevailed his game the victory hath prevailed overcome all obstacles all difficulties everything vanquished have prevailed to open the book and to loose the seals thereof when he advances he prevails when he advances he completely brings under subjection when he advances he conquers when he advances he gains the complete victory and this is how paul can say you are more than a conqueror because the lion of the tribe of judah who became the bloody lamb to purchase your redemption has now taken possession of it and then handed it to you amen amen that's what it means to be more than a conqueror you just yielded to him and he fought the battle for you he's victorious brother bram says here come a lamb this is in the breach been slain and come forth oh my what to make his claims on his redemption its redemption means all legal possession to all that was lost by adam and eve i think that they had a time when they had clear minds they had a clean conscience they had joy they had perfect love they had happiness oh my what ought that to do to a born-again christian it's legal possession to the abstract deed the title deed of eternal life means that you possess everything that adam and eve lost everything you want to know the depth of satan well just know the depths of god first amen inverting it and then he's saying that with the title d the abstract legal possession to the abstract the title deed of eternal life means that you possess everything that adam and eve lost it's your rightful possession so instead of us now thinking that when we go through a mind battle and we fight and we war and we think that the devil is trying to rob our peace and take our joy and get something from us you're taking it back from him he doesn't have the upper hand on you he hasn't outflanked you he doesn't he's not going to try to trick you we recognize the devil in all of his tricks amen that's what overcome means to recognize the devil in every single every one of his tricks and at the same time recognize that greater is he that is in me than he that is in the world and has already overcome him amen so when i come into this battle i don't want to so much think that oh i was just over here minding my own business and also the devil's trying to reach in and grab my joy turn it around you've got more joy of yours to have and so you're going over to that devil and you're taking all your joy out of his dirty grubby hands and you're taking it back he ain't robbing anything you've got you're getting more back because you're possessing everything that adam and eve lost the battle then is evidence that redemption's claims are being enforced he says you have a right to enforce a claim to be restored i'm closed with this statement from the greatest battle ever fought i went a little bit longer than i intended but he says we got a five-star general spelled j-e-s-u-s that awesome yeah five-star general can you get any better than that placing five stars on us f-a-i-t-h he's never lost a battle hallelujah he conquered death hell in the grave get the devils out of the way he's the great chief captain and i love this so the devil isn't even in the picture the greatest battle was ever was ever raged to setting ready right now certainly it is when i think of it when i stood out and watched him do the things see him reveal things open up things say it'll be this way and that way there it is oh look back here say who is this great captain oh i don't look back to see if it's dr so-and-so i see what the captain said he's the captain of our salvation what a salvation deliverance glory he is the captain of our deliverance hear me i'm closing on this the great hour of charge is at hand amen the great hour of charge is at hand it's not the great hour of duck it's not the great out of rod it's not the great hour cover up it's the great hour of charge we're advancing the truth is marching on the light is going forward we're advancing in this the battles that you've experienced whether it be send the light as a church whether it be you as individual christians whether it be in your relationships and circumstances i want you to take a positive approach to it today and say this is only evidence that god know god wants me to have more victory god wants me to have more peace god wants me to have more joy god wants me to have more health the battle is evidence of victory the fact that i'm fighting is not because i'm being attacked but because the word is attacking the adversary and the battle is raging because the word is the aggressor and has brought the war to the devil and the fight is on could we bow our heads please i i there's so much that could be said and expressed and maybe even your own personal sentiments in whatever you're going through but the things that are articulated even in that sermon the greatest battle ever fought he says you just have to surrender to him and i want to invite you today that if you're in a battle and in this greatest battle ever fought i'm not even speaking generally but i want to speak very specifically if you're in a battle if you're in a war then i want to invite you to stand and surrender to him you're not surrendered to the devil you're not you're not indicating to the devil that you're done fighting you're indicating that i'm surrendering to the chief captain and i'm gonna ask and pray that he placed five stars on you today f-a-i-t-h faith as you stand to your feet many are standing and i believe you're standing in your hearts because you want to surrender to him whatever it is you're going through we're not giving you all these tips and tricks on how to beat the devil we're just saying surrender to him yeah yield to him today if we could just all stand together i'd like to pray for you our gracious heavenly father we are surrendering we give it all to you lord we're yielding submitting and i pray father that as we have stood with heads bowed and hearts yielded place upon us of five stars of faith lord if we've lost sight of it just maybe straighten it out a little bit pat us on the back lord call to our names maybe we've run headlong into unbelief and doubt and sin not because we were going forward but because we were running backwards then we come back to you today may we not make the mistake that we've made before that whenever our convictions were stirred up we wanted to roll up our sleeves and we gritted our teeth and said we were going to go fight the devil no lord may we finally just surrender to you amen just give it all to you lord yield say lord i'm done fighting fight for me i'm done raging in my mind i'm done wrestling it out and questioning and wondering trying to figure it out and pursuing remedies lord i'm just yielding i'm surrendering to you i commit myself to you now lord i pray that you touch the people bless them strengthen them and encourage them for their intentiveness lord for their their brightness lord of their faces and even how sincere they are in receiving the word i pray that you bless them and i pray that your love would be poured out upon them may there be victories lord may there be deliverances and testimonies of restoration and forgiveness and redemption it's a strange phrase lord invert always invert but we saw your prophet do it and speaking of the thigh tree and age and now lord we've done it with the greatest battle ever fought it's not the devil beating me up lord it's you beating the devil up and he's just mad and i'm the only one he can get to [Music] so i'm running behind you today lord hiding myself in the rock

yours [Music] have faith in god for the answer have faith in god amen i trust you're standing in faith today we heard beyond a masterpiece we heard such an inverted message another way of looking at the things that we battle on a regular basis and we want to take this word and leave here with faith of moving forward no matter what the battle is no matter what we're going through we're going to move forward can you say amen to that amen amen let's sing i will not be denied amen [Music] is [Music] i would not be denied till jesus came and made me holy [Music] courage i would not need [Music]

victory over to you we are blessed people we are a blessed people well take this victory with you [Music] and be positive be positive that's what we heard today be positive look at it positive even the prophet said something so miraculous about positivity he said the right mental attitude towards any divine promise of god will bring it to pass be positive amen and as we go forward things are going to get harder but when we say victory's mine joy is mine peace is mine what we're doing we're claiming something that's before us that means we're moving forward get behind me satan we're moving forward it's it's it's okay it's okay we're in better shape today than when we were back in the world when it didn't matter what we were doing god is just wanting us to take possession so when the holy ghost comes knocks on you and says you shouldn't do that or you need to do that take that as a wonderful uh onward towards victory and not a discouragement but god just wants us to take more land amen amen may the lord be with you and bless you and fill your heart with joy amen so good to see sister trina here today praise the lord she's in her and she's in her home back home amen but she's
