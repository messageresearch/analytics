[33:15] safe and especially those of you that
[33:19] are sick and wanting to keep the
[33:21] sickness out of the church I just think

[33:41] let's look to the author of this book
[33:43] amen Heavenly Father we come to you Lord

[33:51] songs that we sung about being
[33:55] humble as humbly as we know how Lord
[33:59] our dependency is on you at this
[34:02] time we got an education we went to
[34:05] school we're able to
[34:07] read but
[34:09] Lord without the Holy Spirit we don't
[34:12] really know what these words truly
[34:16] mean and we're asking today that you
[34:19] would give us the

[34:55] Waters and bring
[34:58] us Lord to a stable place with
[35:02] you we thank you for these things now
[35:05] Lord we pray your blessings on this
[35:08] service in Jesus Christ's name amen amen
[35:12] Matthew chapter 16 starting with verse
[35:15] number 15 this is a very familiar
[35:17] scripture about
[35:21] Revelation and
[35:24] Jesus uh asked the question to his
[35:27] disciples he says but whom say ye that I
[35:33] am and Simon Peter answered and said
[35:37] well Thou Art the Christ the son of the
[35:40] Living God and Jesus answered and said
[35:43] unto him blessed art thou Simon barjona
[35:46] for Flesh and Blood have not revealed it
[35:48] unto thee but my Father which is in
[35:51] heaven and I say unto thee that thou art
[35:54] petered
[35:55] Upon This Rock I will build my my church
[35:59] and the gates of house shall not Prevail
[36:01] against it amen God bless you you may be
[36:04] seated we want to entitle the service
[36:07] today Christian
[36:10] stability and many things could be said
[36:13] about Christian
[36:14] stability uh but we just want to help us
[36:17] to become more stable and I'm usually
[36:21] when I think about subjects I like to
[36:23] kind of want to do a a complete subject
[36:26] and try to take a balance and and and
[36:30] just do the whole thing and it's really
[36:34] hard to do that because there's so
[36:38] much so much in in really all these
[36:42] sermons but we just want to have for a
[36:44] subject tonight stabilizing your walk
[36:48] with God stabilizing your walk with God
[36:51] every vehicle has what's called a
[36:54] stabilizer and uh without the stabilizer
[36:57] the car will go down the road it will
[37:00] function it will go over
[37:02] bumps it will still get you to where you
[37:06] got to go but the
[37:08] stabilizer it does help bring a
[37:11] stability to the
[37:14] ride showing showing there um a little a
[37:20] purpose but some points I want to bring
[37:22] out about our opening of scripture here
[37:26] um when we think about Christian
[37:30] stability remember it's
[37:33] personal first uh Jesus is talking to
[37:37] his disciples about what other people
[37:39] are saying and then he turns and he
[37:41] makes it personal but but what do you
[37:44] say it's between you and God so when you
[37:48] talk about Christian stability it really
[37:50] has nothing to do with the person you're
[37:51] sitting next to the person you live with
[37:54] the person you walk with the person
[37:56] that's speaking to you that ministers to
[37:59] you it is totally between you and God so
[38:01] you have no one to blame but yourself
[38:05] but you have no one to give glory to
[38:07] except God because he's the one that
[38:09] stabilizes
[38:11] us you can only receive stability from
[38:16] God man cannot give it to
[38:22] you man cannot give you the
[38:26] stability that the
[38:29] devil can't even come
[38:34] against the Gates of Hell cannot Prevail
[38:38] against the stability that only God can
[38:40] give you now a man can help
[38:44] you they said if a man talks you in
[38:46] something somebody smarter than him can
[38:48] come along and talk you talk you out of
[38:51] it talk you into something different a
[38:53] different type of a car different uh
[38:55] shoes or or or or a different
[38:59] phone right if you had a chance uh with
[39:03] with five different salesmen and and
[39:06] five different phones it probably would
[39:08] be a little bit harder to choose one
[39:12] right so the stability that we're
[39:15] looking for in Christian stability it
[39:18] can only come from
[39:21] God it is the rock of Christian
[39:24] stability where God continues to reveal
[39:27] himself to you personally that becomes
[39:30] the very building in which God chooses
[39:32] to be in that's the church notice this
[39:36] is about his
[39:38] church it this is not about our lives
[39:42] our jobs our
[39:44] families it's about our
[39:46] church it it it's about God's church
[39:49] that that he connects the revealing of
[39:53] Jesus Christ with the place that he
[39:55] decides to dwell in so it's important
[39:59] that we find Christ when we come to
[40:02] church here yes we've got needs and yes
[40:04] there's we need we want answers we want
[40:07] directions but if we're interested in
[40:11] God building his church in us it's not
[40:14] about any revealing of any other thing
[40:17] but who he
[40:20] is God could reveal to me every place on
[40:24] our property that has uh
[40:28] some sort of uh value to it right some
[40:31] sort of minerals or Golds or diamonds or
[40:35] uh oil or something and and that would
[40:39] be a wonderful thing but it would have
[40:41] nothing to do with building his church
[40:45] in
[40:46] me so just trying to show that Christian
[40:51] stability can only come from God about
[40:55] God and not just
[40:58] about
[40:59] us all right Peter had a revelation who
[41:04] Jesus
[41:05] was but you notice it wasn't enough now
[41:11] this is important to
[41:14] understand why wasn't it
[41:17] enough he still needed God inside of
[41:23] him he knew in this scripture who Jesus
[41:26] was there was no doubt there was no
[41:29] question but because the Holy Spirit
[41:31] wasn't inside of him he got to a place
[41:34] that he actually lied and he said he
[41:35] didn't know who God was didn't know who
[41:37] Jesus was
[41:39] true so he didn't have the Christian
[41:43] stability that he
[41:46] needed just by Revelation alone he
[41:49] needed God inside of him am so important
[41:53] we can't under overemphasize the
[41:57] importance of getting more of the Holy
[41:59] Ghost do not be satisfied with how much
[42:01] you have get more get more because the
[42:04] more of the Life of Christ is inside you
[42:07] the more that the word becomes real to
[42:12] you what Christian stability is not let
[42:16] me start with that Christian
[42:19] stability it is not speaking in an
[42:23] unknown
[42:25] language or God us using your vessel at
[42:29] times that's not Christian stability
[42:32] it's not knowing the message or the
[42:34] messenger or the Mysteries or or even
[42:37] who your pastor
[42:39] is it's not repentance or being baptized
[42:42] correctly or attending church it's not
[42:47] measured by your moral compass or your
[42:50] opinion about really what's happening in
[42:53] the world affairs right
[42:54] now that's not Christian
[42:59] stability now the definition of just
[43:04] stability is the state or the quality of
[43:07] being stable you know you're not allowed
[43:09] to put those words in the word when
[43:12] you're trying to get the definition so
[43:13] now we're going to to find out what
[43:14] stable is but finishing stability it is
[43:18] firmness in position so now we're just
[43:21] thinking about this naturally for a
[43:23] minute so we can understand what it is
[43:26] in Christianity
[43:28] ity it's continuous without change it's
[43:33] permanence in chemistry it's a
[43:36] resistance to chemical change or uh dis
[43:40] uh
[43:41] dis
[43:43] intergration it's resistance to change
[43:46] especially Sudden Change or
[43:49] deterioration it's a steadfastness it's
[43:51] a
[43:52] consistency as of character or purpose
[43:55] so some words like stability
[43:59] steadfastness strength soundness Poise
[44:03] and balance see all these things are
[44:07] words of
[44:09] stability now the definition of stable
[44:13] is it's not likely to
[44:16] fall to give way as a structure a
[44:20] support a foundation affirm or study now
[44:24] obviously Peter did not not have that
[44:28] when he had the
[44:31] revelation we can't depend on getting
[44:34] the revelation of the word and letting
[44:37] the Holy Spirit of the word become left
[44:43] behind so when God gives you a
[44:45] revelation he shows you something I want
[44:48] you to remember the words that Jesus
[44:50] said he said but wait and T until you be
[44:54] endued with with the power from on high
[44:57] to make that word that I just gave you
[44:59] live and stand the test amen amen
[45:05] amen it means able or likely to continue
[45:09] or
[45:10] last firmly established enduring or
[45:13] permanent a stable government resistant
[45:17] to Sudden Change or
[45:19] deterioration a stable an example is a
[45:22] stable economy is the aim of every
[45:25] government of course
[45:27] we certainly would like a stable
[45:29] government in our country Would we not
[45:33] steadfast not waving or
[45:36] changeable not subject to now listen to
[45:39] this not subject to emotional
[45:43] instability or illness sane or mentally
[45:47] sound so those are some good words of
[45:50] course we would have a pretty I good
[45:52] idea what stability would be but
[45:57] Christian
[45:58] stability is I want you to take those
[46:02] words and apply them to your spiritual
[46:07] walk Christian stability is not necessar
[46:10] possessing the ability to most likely
[46:13] not fall or fail but rather possessing
[46:17] the stable attitude of getting up as
[46:20] soon as you
[46:22] fall because we can never be at a place
[46:25] where we're just not going to make
[46:26] mistakes we're not going to get upset
[46:28] we're not going to be bothered we're
[46:30] we're not going to fall you as long as
[46:33] you're human you're going to make
[46:39] mistakes so Christian stability is not
[46:42] keeping yourself from doing that
[46:45] Proverbs 24:16 says for a just man
[46:48] falleth seven times and riseth up again
[46:52] see that's Christian
[46:55] stability but the wicked shall fall into
[46:59] Mischief so they fall just like the just
[47:02] men but in other words they stay down in
[47:05] their
[47:06] situation they make an excuse while it's
[47:10] okay they're unstable they're
[47:13] double-minded they think that it's okay
[47:15] to do this right now they feel they can
[47:18] still be a Christian down there that's
[47:21] why they don't get back up
[47:25] right that's not Christian
[47:30] stability Christian stability starts in
[47:33] the heart of a
[47:35] Believer it starts inside the core
[47:40] Proverbs 23:7 says for as a man thinketh
[47:44] in his heart so is
[47:46] he so if his heart is found in two
[47:50] different places then it will try to
[47:54] lead in two different directions
[47:59] you ever like been at a restaurant and
[48:01] you're looking at the menu I don't need
[48:03] to say anything more you know what I'm
[48:05] going to
[48:08] say what do I like what do I want you
[48:12] know I should ask somebody else what I
[48:14] should
[48:16] get when they don't even know what I'm
[48:19] feeling like but I'm going to ask them
[48:21] and I'm G put my confidence in somebody
[48:23] else who doesn't even know what I feel
[48:25] like today
[48:34] unstable two different I'm it's between
[48:36] this and
[48:38] this do I want breakfast or do I want
[48:41] lunch do I want a coffee or do I want
[48:44] pop or you know should I just get water
[48:49] tea and you become I'm not
[48:53] sure so you ask the waitress what do you
[48:56] think I should
[49:03] get Matthew chapter 6 verse
[49:06] 21 for where your treasure
[49:09] is there will your heart be also and
[49:13] we're going to see a number of these
[49:14] scriptures from our men's
[49:17] meeting for where your treasure is there
[49:21] will your heart be
[49:24] also but you can't
[49:27] have your treasure in two different
[49:30] places this is what's important we try
[49:33] the devil's always trying to get us to
[49:35] do that you can have God and you can
[49:37] have the world you can be involved with
[49:40] God but then you can have your own life
[49:42] too you can have God's will and you can
[49:45] have your
[49:47] will you can't have your treasure in the
[49:50] things of God and the things of the
[49:54] world Matthew 6 24 no man can serve two
[50:00] masters for E either he will hate the
[50:03] one and love the other or else he'll
[50:06] hold to the one and despise the other
[50:07] you cannot serve God and
[50:12] Mamon we can't spiritually love God and
[50:15] carnally love the things of this world
[50:18] Amen God won't allow it he won't be part
[50:21] of it you can try the devil will will
[50:24] will will get you to go that area but
[50:27] eventually God will get out of your
[50:33] life he told us in St John chapter 15
[50:36] that unless we stay connected to him
[50:38] stay connected to the
[50:41] vine that uh we won't bear the fruit we
[50:44] won't have the
[50:46] life he he
[50:48] refuses to be our joy to be our peace to
[50:53] be our love if we separate from him and
[50:58] try to find our
[51:00] consolation and our our our our hope and
[51:04] our our our peace and our gratification
[51:07] and our and whatever we're looking for
[51:10] out here in the
[51:14] world 1 John chap 2:1 15 If any man
[51:20] love the world the love of the father is
[51:23] not in
[51:25] him God God will not take second
[51:30] place if he isn't Lord of everything
[51:34] he's not Lord at all we're these are in
[51:36] my notes brothers and these are the very
[51:38] things that came out in our men's
[51:40] meeting if he's not the master of
[51:44] everything he won't be Master at all he
[51:46] will not allow us to serve two
[51:53] masters Jesus said in the last days
[51:55] men's Hearts would be failing them for
[51:58] fear think about the hour we're living
[52:01] in men are paying attention to the wrong
[52:05] Master Jesus would not allow us to be in
[52:09] a state of of of demonic forces and
[52:14] powers to make us down and depressed
[52:17] that ain't what God would lead us
[52:19] to obviously we're listening to the
[52:22] wrong master we're listening to the
[52:24] wrong
[52:25] spirits
[52:27] Paul prophesied about the future in 2020
[52:31] that the churchgoing people would become
[52:34] lovers of pleasure more than lovers of
[52:37] God so now we got some whose hearts are
[52:40] are failing for fear and they're just so
[52:42] distrupt about there's no uh stability
[52:45] in the world and then you've got the the
[52:47] churchgoing people who feel uh somewhat
[52:51] good but they're stuck in leoda and
[52:53] they're finding that that they're in
[52:55] love with getting pleased more there in
[52:58] love with God two
[53:03] masters you cannot serve God in this
[53:06] world at the same time amen so somewhere
[53:10] down the road you're going we're going
[53:12] to lose the joy of the
[53:17] Lord you can't be bothered by the world
[53:19] and you can't get into the pleasures of
[53:21] the world right either one are going to
[53:23] zap the strength out of you that's true
[53:26] zap your stability right out of you
[53:29] another example of this is the parable
[53:32] of the S when the word was preached it
[53:35] fell into a man's heart that had been
[53:38] mixed with the things of the world now
[53:40] what happened the word was preached they
[53:44] received the word and they brought forth
[53:47] fruit but because there was another seed
[53:52] in there a seed of the world a cares of
[53:55] life
[53:57] that it choked out the word now why was
[54:01] that more stronger than the word I
[54:03] thought nothing's more powerful than the
[54:05] word because God will not allow himself
[54:09] to be in a place that you choose to have
[54:12] part of the world
[54:14] there he just won't take second true
[54:19] amen so these are good examples that you
[54:23] can't serve two
[54:25] masters
[54:27] amen
[54:30] eventually God is going to get choked
[54:32] out of our life in the course the devil
[54:35] never tells us that when he gives us
[54:38] Temptation so stability must start at
[54:41] the core of our
[54:43] heart our deeper thoughts originate from
[54:47] our
[54:48] heart we ought to be learning how to be
[54:52] more singl minded because that's the
[54:56] problem the devil's always trying to get
[54:57] us go two different directions for God
[55:01] has not given us a spirit of fear but of
[55:03] power love and what a sound mind we need
[55:06] a sound mind for Christian stability
[55:10] right amen A sound mind comes from the
[55:12] spirit of God in order to have Christian
[55:14] stability a Believer must have a sound
[55:18] mind it's not an option it's a
[55:24] must James chapter 1 1 verse
[55:28] 5 James you thought I was calling on you
[55:30] didn't you when I said that James you
[55:33] are the
[55:34] one you are the one but
[55:37] you you're much older than
[55:40] five James chapter 1 verse5 if any of
[55:44] you lack wisdom let them ask of God that
[55:48] giveth the all men liberally so he's no
[55:51] respector of persons if you just ask and
[55:55] he uth not and it shall be given him but
[55:58] let him ask in faith nothing
[56:02] wavering no reluctance no seesaw no
[56:06] footing
[56:07] around nothing wavering for he that
[56:11] waver or hesitates is like a wave of the
[56:16] sea that's driven with the wind and it's
[56:19] toss so I just want you to picture
[56:21] you're staring at that
[56:23] beautiful uh ocean and the shoreline and
[56:27] the waves are coming in and they're
[56:30] beating against the rocks and um this is
[56:34] what God describes as someone who
[56:39] waivers
[56:43] right I woke up in the morning and saw
[56:46] the water how it was just as peaceful
[56:49] and calm as could be
[56:53] stable stable ships really wouldn't uh I
[56:58] don't think the FR Gerald would have
[57:00] went down if the waters would have been
[57:04] stable so Satan wants to to cause an
[57:09] unstable condition in your
[57:12] mind because he's trying to shipwreck
[57:15] you trying to bring things in your life
[57:18] to get you so bottled up and so consumed
[57:22] with things that you you can't be stable
[57:25] in walk with the
[57:30] Lord because we have that mindset that
[57:34] well as long as I go to church as long
[57:37] as I still believe in
[57:39] God and all those things you're just
[57:44] showing a
[57:48] wavering for let not that man think that
[57:51] he shall receive
[57:53] anything of the Lord
[57:59] James was so sure of the Revelation that
[58:02] he had that God was so against without
[58:06] faith it's impossible to please
[58:09] him but this man that
[58:13] waivers he's not going to receive
[58:15] anything of the Lord it would be better
[58:16] for him to be humble and to say Lord I
[58:19] believe but help thou my unbelief at
[58:21] least he's staying stable with his
[58:24] Direction amen that's right that's true
[58:26] he's not pretending he's not acting he's
[58:29] not being
[58:31] storefront right am a double-minded man
[58:36] is unstable in every single
[58:41] way because as a man think it so is he
[58:46] right it's so easy you ever have a ever
[58:50] had two people telling you what to do
[58:54] Brother Bruce if you're listening to
[58:55] this
[58:56] I know you know what I'm talking
[59:00] about when you have two bosses telling
[59:04] you what to do brother Mark you've had
[59:07] this
[59:10] before it it you feel so uncomfortable
[59:13] you know you're wrong no matter what you
[59:15] do because you've been told two
[59:18] different
[59:19] things and it's so uncomfortable when
[59:22] you're
[59:24] unstable thinking about
[59:26] where should I go here should I do this
[59:27] should I do this should I do that and
[59:29] it's like you're trying to be the one
[59:33] that's making the
[59:35] decision somehow there's another Spirit
[59:38] has gotten in there and has caused you
[59:41] to to um
[59:44] question the
[59:49] word in other words I'm going to make an
[59:53] excuse why I don't have to
[59:59] there's this reason right here I don't
[1:00:01] have to follow the
[1:00:03] word God sees it God knows God
[1:00:06] understands my
[1:00:08] heart well I would go with that if you
[1:00:13] could show me that
[1:00:18] scripture if after you bum a ride to
[1:00:21] church and you make it there in Sunday
[1:00:24] and that's the only other time you can
[1:00:26] can do is get your your car working
[1:00:29] after church I'm all for
[1:00:33] it because that's the ox in the
[1:00:36] ditch that means if I walk out and one
[1:00:38] of my goats got their head between the
[1:00:41] chicken
[1:00:42] wires something's wrong I got to help
[1:00:45] that but we go ahead and we make Sunday
[1:00:48] the extra
[1:00:50] day and then we say well if we just had
[1:00:53] more time for the Lord
[1:00:56] when he already gave it to
[1:00:58] us but what are we doing with it using
[1:01:01] it for
[1:01:05] oursel don't be
[1:01:09] double-minded so when your heart goes
[1:01:11] into different directions your mind will
[1:01:13] try to follow the same two
[1:01:17] directions this creates an unstable
[1:01:20] condition James is declaring a Believer
[1:01:23] who is who's in this condition is
[1:01:26] unstable in all his ways and how can a
[1:01:30] Christian have stability in his life
[1:01:33] when he's
[1:01:34] unstable in all of his
[1:01:39] ways may God help every one of us and I
[1:01:45] I would that the whole church was
[1:01:48] watching our young people are are all
[1:01:52] the people that want to become more
[1:01:54] established that's what this word is
[1:01:57] for stability starts in our hearts for
[1:02:01] as a man thinketh so is he so learning
[1:02:04] how to be led is not a gift from God
[1:02:09] it's a character that we learn to
[1:02:13] develop Proverbs 3:6 in all thy ways
[1:02:18] acknowledge Him and He Shall direct thy
[1:02:22] paths be not wise in thine own eyes fear
[1:02:25] the lord and depart from
[1:02:27] Evil so acknowledging the Lord in all
[1:02:30] their ways will lead to Christian
[1:02:33] stability the problem is is most of the
[1:02:37] time we either got it figured
[1:02:39] out or we want it to go a certain way so
[1:02:43] there's no need to acknowledge the
[1:02:48] Lord you don't acknowledge them how is
[1:02:50] he going to Dr well I just know because
[1:02:52] you know we've done this
[1:02:54] before
[1:02:58] God
[1:02:59] wants he's the only one that can
[1:03:01] stabilize
[1:03:03] us he's the the stabilizer for our life
[1:03:08] and when we are wise in our own eyes and
[1:03:11] we think we got things figured
[1:03:14] out that's when we need to really choose
[1:03:16] to fear the
[1:03:18] lord I could be wrong about this
[1:03:21] situation I know it happened like but
[1:03:23] but maybe the Lord wants us to pray
[1:03:25] about it again because maybe he doesn't
[1:03:27] want
[1:03:28] it so when you're wise in your own eyes
[1:03:32] God calls that
[1:03:34] evil that's truly what evil is our flesh
[1:03:38] is
[1:03:42] evil acknowledge the Lord in all thy
[1:03:45] ways will bring Christian
[1:03:48] stability the Lord is not going to hand
[1:03:50] that to us on a silver
[1:03:52] platter it's not a gift you have to
[1:03:55] fight for it you have to humble
[1:03:58] yourself you have to learn
[1:04:01] to not be wise in your own eyes you have
[1:04:05] to remember you don't got
[1:04:08] it we have to learn to fear the lord
[1:04:11] it's a choice that we're constantly
[1:04:13] faced with every day the devil is going
[1:04:16] to let you know you're so
[1:04:19] smart you're so spiritual you know
[1:04:23] what's happening you know what to do
[1:04:26] you've got this it's an easy
[1:04:31] choice that is wise in your own
[1:04:37] eyes this is what we need to combat and
[1:04:41] overcome for Christian
[1:04:44] stability it's not being able to figure
[1:04:46] out a
[1:04:48] situation it's about acknowledging the
[1:04:50] Lord about the
[1:04:52] situation I could be wrong four words
[1:04:56] words we learn to say if we would learn
[1:04:59] to say them more I could be
[1:05:01] wrong and from the heart and really mean
[1:05:04] it from the heart because I could be
[1:05:06] wrong is what's going to help you
[1:05:09] acknowledge the
[1:05:10] Lord and when you acknowledge Him it's a
[1:05:14] promise he's going to direct our
[1:05:17] paths he may not do it right that minute
[1:05:19] but it's going to happen because you
[1:05:22] fulfilled your
[1:05:23] part amen
[1:05:26] 2 Corinthians chapter
[1:05:28] 10:3 2 Corinthians chapter 10:3 for
[1:05:31] though we walk in the flesh we do not
[1:05:35] war after the
[1:05:37] flesh for the weapons of our Warfare are
[1:05:41] not
[1:05:43] carnal in other words
[1:05:46] it's it's not oh yeah I got
[1:05:50] this I know I'm spiritual I've got
[1:05:53] discernment on this
[1:05:56] those uh are carnal
[1:06:02] weapons I mean seriously I mean my my
[1:06:05] mom and my dad and his girlfriends and
[1:06:09] those people that tried to raise
[1:06:14] me would try to
[1:06:16] express they know what they're talking
[1:06:22] about it was a carnal weapon
[1:06:27] it was their knowledge it was their
[1:06:29] their tuition their intuition their all
[1:06:33] their
[1:06:35] ISS it was what they were using to bring
[1:06:39] their point
[1:06:40] across we are walking in the flesh we do
[1:06:43] have to deal with this
[1:06:45] situation but we don't use
[1:06:51] carnality for the weapons of our Warfare
[1:06:54] are not car But Mighty through God to
[1:06:57] the pulling down of
[1:07:01] strongholds just pull those thoughts
[1:07:04] down when you think you got it pull that
[1:07:08] down those are evil thoughts be not wise
[1:07:11] in your own eyes just pull that
[1:07:16] down oh but they're so strong brother
[1:07:19] John I just feel it so strong I just
[1:07:22] know pull it down amen pull it down
[1:07:26] get them out of
[1:07:27] there verse five casting down
[1:07:33] imaginations and every High thing that
[1:07:36] exalteth itself against the knowledge of
[1:07:39] God well the knowledge of God is to be
[1:07:42] not wise in your own eyes to acknowledge
[1:07:45] the Lord in all thy ways that is the
[1:07:47] knowledge of God that is the word of God
[1:07:50] so anything outside of that to me is a
[1:07:54] is a high
[1:07:56] thought it's a it's an imagination it's
[1:07:58] something that's not the will of
[1:08:03] God anything that exalts itself against
[1:08:07] the knowledge of
[1:08:09] God to me that could
[1:08:13] be the knowledge of God is I could be
[1:08:18] wrong because that's what the prophet
[1:08:20] taught
[1:08:21] me and bringing into captivity
[1:08:26] every thought to The Obedience of Christ
[1:08:28] now in our minds we can have thoughts
[1:08:31] bouncing all over the
[1:08:33] place just you
[1:08:37] know and you have to bring every thought
[1:08:40] in
[1:08:42] subjection now that's your
[1:08:45] job Christian stability you need to
[1:08:48] bring that thought in
[1:08:50] subjection if you don't you're opening
[1:08:54] yourself up
[1:08:56] for instability or a double
[1:09:01] mind in other words I'm going to
[1:09:04] acknowledge the Lord about this
[1:09:08] situation and he's going to direct your
[1:09:11] path don't try to figure it out on your
[1:09:18] own and having in a
[1:09:22] Readiness to Revenge all
[1:09:26] Disobedience when your obedience is
[1:09:30] fulfilled so when Satan is attacking us
[1:09:33] attacking our minds we're in a battle
[1:09:36] God is still expecting in
[1:09:40] obedience and it starts with our mind we
[1:09:44] don't allow the devil in
[1:09:48] there we don't let them
[1:09:50] stay and if we did stay we thought
[1:09:54] something and we said something to get
[1:09:56] back
[1:09:56] up amen okay so now look at this do you
[1:10:00] look on the things after the outward
[1:10:02] appearance that's
[1:10:04] carnal If any man trust to himself if
[1:10:09] any man trust to himself that he
[1:10:13] is that he is Christ let him of himself
[1:10:18] think this again that he is that as he
[1:10:22] is Christ even so are we
[1:10:27] Christ in other
[1:10:29] words what's the message that Paul is
[1:10:32] getting across he's talking to people
[1:10:35] who think who believe they belong to
[1:10:41] God and he says I know that you believe
[1:10:45] you're you're you're walking with the
[1:10:47] Lord You're of God but if you are
[1:10:50] acknowledged that what I am telling you
[1:10:53] is of the Lord I'm walking with the Lord
[1:10:55] I'm and I'm telling you what God wants
[1:10:58] God wants you to cast those thoughts
[1:11:01] down they'll that's what's bringing so
[1:11:05] much instability because you got you
[1:11:07] allow the devil to go in your mind and
[1:11:08] all these imaginations and and things
[1:11:11] and you just let them float around and
[1:11:12] you don't bring anything into captivity
[1:11:14] you never say this is this and that is
[1:11:17] that you just well it's all just part of
[1:11:19] the whole
[1:11:24] shebang
[1:11:31] acknowledge the Lord in all thy
[1:11:36] ways it's the proof that you're choosing
[1:11:39] to fear the
[1:11:41] lord when you take time to say Lord this
[1:11:44] is my situation this is this is what's
[1:11:46] happening it right there you're choosing
[1:11:48] to fear the
[1:11:50] lord a lot of times the devil's going to
[1:11:52] tell you what don't make a difference
[1:11:55] you you don't got time anyways to wait
[1:11:58] for his answer just
[1:12:01] go he's
[1:12:04] sneaky but I'm telling you if you
[1:12:06] acknowledge the Lord if you put him in
[1:12:09] the situation he will stabilize the
[1:12:12] situation he will stabilize your life
[1:12:14] he'll stabilize your mind because you're
[1:12:17] inviting the stabilizer
[1:12:20] in your
[1:12:22] prayer is the knock on God's
[1:12:27] door and his voice spoken to you
[1:12:30] personally is when he chooses to open
[1:12:33] that door and I think this is important
[1:12:34] to understand because the Bible says
[1:12:37] ask and it shall be ask and you
[1:12:42] shall ask and you shall
[1:12:46] find ask and should be given seek and
[1:12:49] you shall find knocking the door shall
[1:12:50] be
[1:12:51] open you have to keep on keep
[1:12:56] on so sometimes when we ask the
[1:13:00] Lord and he doesn't respond we stand and
[1:13:03] we're still knocking I want you to
[1:13:04] picture you're knocking on the door I'm
[1:13:06] still
[1:13:08] waiting I'm still waiting for an answer
[1:13:10] Lord I'm not going forward until I hear
[1:13:15] you because his voice is when the door
[1:13:18] opens then you know the answer to that
[1:13:23] situation prayer
[1:13:26] is your vehicle to God I want you to
[1:13:29] picture it's your vehicle to God how
[1:13:32] much you pray is how fast your vehicle
[1:13:36] goes the effectual fervent prayer of a
[1:13:39] righteous man it avails much he gets
[1:13:41] down the road pretty quick he gets the
[1:13:44] job
[1:13:47] done now the scripture I just want to
[1:13:49] try to bring it balance the scripture
[1:13:51] says that before we'll ask he will
[1:13:54] answer in other words the answer is
[1:13:57] already on the way God knows about it
[1:14:00] but we're living in an hour where it's
[1:14:02] hard to pray it's hard to spend time
[1:14:07] praying but God is requiring more prayer
[1:14:11] he even brings out when when uh when the
[1:14:14] son of man returns shall he find faith
[1:14:16] on the earth and that whole Parable is
[1:14:18] that men ought to pray and not faint
[1:14:24] amen so our
[1:14:26] prayers are the knock on Heaven's Door
[1:14:30] and his voice to us personally becomes
[1:14:32] the direction for our
[1:14:35] lives but that has nothing to do with
[1:14:37] God building his church in
[1:14:40] us but still it's the direction for our
[1:14:44] life and when you're seeking something
[1:14:46] different
[1:14:48] than where to go where to live what job
[1:14:51] to take should I get this car Lord help
[1:14:55] me with this with that with the with the
[1:14:58] other is it okay to buy this to go on
[1:15:01] this vacation to have fellowship with
[1:15:04] these
[1:15:08] people in other words when you're
[1:15:11] seeking to know God more your prayers
[1:15:14] are still the knock on God's
[1:15:18] door it just you're wanting the
[1:15:22] information for your personal life and
[1:15:25] not for God's church
[1:15:29] building but his voice spoken to you
[1:15:32] personally is the door that opens to you
[1:15:35] the revelation of Jesus
[1:15:39] Christ when his
[1:15:41] voice speaks to you that's the
[1:15:45] door when his when God speaks to you and
[1:15:50] reveals to you who he is that's the door
[1:15:55] of Revelation open to
[1:16:01] you and that's the
[1:16:04] door that will bring building blocks to
[1:16:07] the church he wants to live in I'll
[1:16:09] imagine for a moment that God spends you
[1:16:13] you want God to help you with everything
[1:16:15] you come to him and you acknowledge Him
[1:16:17] about everything except becoming
[1:16:22] him in other words I got a whole list of
[1:16:25] things that I want help Direction
[1:16:27] leadership for God promised he'd direct
[1:16:30] those things in my
[1:16:32] life but I spend very little time saying
[1:16:35] I want to know you
[1:16:38] more because that's the only thing that
[1:16:40] he's building his church in we and
[1:16:43] Satan's always telling us you know Jesus
[1:16:46] enough you've been a Christian for so
[1:16:48] long you you've been bapt you know you
[1:16:50] got you know you no need anymore you
[1:16:55] just stay busy with all these other
[1:16:57] things in your
[1:17:00] life just just try to get God and all
[1:17:02] those other
[1:17:04] thing see the trick it would be better
[1:17:07] if you didn't have anything nothing but
[1:17:09] you spent all your time seeking to know
[1:17:11] God more he's the only one that can
[1:17:13] stabilize your life you you God could an
[1:17:15] you with so many things and never be
[1:17:17] stable in your
[1:17:23] life
[1:17:28] we don't want a revelation of which
[1:17:30] restaurant to eat
[1:17:32] at or what property to hunt or where to
[1:17:35] vacation at those things God is not
[1:17:38] building his church in
[1:17:41] that now imagine having revelation of
[1:17:44] everything except the revelation of
[1:17:47] Jesus
[1:17:48] Christ for a second just imagine
[1:17:53] that you could understand all the
[1:17:56] Mysteries you could have all knowledge
[1:17:59] you could have all Faith so that you
[1:18:01] could remove mountains the Bible
[1:18:03] says but if you didn't have the
[1:18:05] revelation of Jesus Christ you'd still
[1:18:08] be
[1:18:10] nothing because Jesus Christ is
[1:18:14] love he is the love of
[1:18:17] God and we're nothing without
[1:18:22] Christ we're nothing without
[1:18:27] Christ human
[1:18:30] stability will mimic Christian
[1:18:34] stability I don't want you to get these
[1:18:36] two mixed
[1:18:37] up because people can be pretty stable
[1:18:43] naturally and
[1:18:46] unstable
[1:18:48] spiritually human stability will look on
[1:18:53] things after the outward
[1:18:56] appearance and may not love someone
[1:19:00] who's hurt or offended you right that's
[1:19:03] human
[1:19:06] stability human stability will trust in
[1:19:12] himself think and feel that they can
[1:19:14] make it without the person who had done
[1:19:17] them
[1:19:19] wrong this is this is a good one well
[1:19:23] you know they should I know they should
[1:19:24] did that you know
[1:19:27] what I don't need
[1:19:29] them not knowing they're part of the
[1:19:32] body but we feel bad because they
[1:19:36] offended
[1:19:37] us not realizing that we're the ones
[1:19:40] that need to intercede for them there is
[1:19:43] a reason to love your enemies there's a
[1:19:45] reason to pray for those that
[1:19:46] despitefully use
[1:19:48] you isn't just to make your life more
[1:19:52] miserable it's because God wants to use
[1:19:55] your vessel to intercede for
[1:19:58] them now Christian stability is being
[1:20:01] able to forgive seven times
[1:20:07] 70 not just seven
[1:20:10] times Jesus said to Peter that is not
[1:20:14] stable 7 time 70 it just keeps
[1:20:19] going not questioning Christian
[1:20:22] stability is not questioning if we feel
[1:20:25] like it or
[1:20:27] not you know if somebody offends you and
[1:20:29] you have to keep forgiving them over and
[1:20:32] over you know you want to sit there and
[1:20:35] question about this thing I don't know
[1:20:38] if I feel like doing
[1:20:39] this it's not judging the person's
[1:20:44] sincerity first before you forgive them
[1:20:48] well I don't know quite how sincere they
[1:20:50] are about this that's not Christian
[1:20:53] stability now not being afraid that it
[1:20:56] won't be the last time how many times
[1:20:58] you do that I you know I forgave you
[1:21:00] about this so you know what it's
[1:21:03] probably not going to be the last time
[1:21:05] either that's not Christian
[1:21:09] stability it's not making some
[1:21:13] excuse of why you're not going to
[1:21:17] forgive Christian stability is following
[1:21:20] the word of God line upon line
[1:21:23] regardless of how you feel
[1:21:25] regardless of what you think regardless
[1:21:27] of what you imagine the word becomes
[1:21:30] your absolute becomes your
[1:21:34] stabilizer man shall not
[1:21:38] live but by every word of
[1:21:43] God Christian stability is not the
[1:21:47] knowledge of God's stable
[1:21:53] word
[1:21:58] it's
[1:21:59] following every word of
[1:22:02] God that's what Christian stability is
[1:22:06] we get under the the feeling of I know I
[1:22:10] know I know the knowing does not
[1:22:13] stabilize
[1:22:16] you it may puff you up it may make you
[1:22:19] feel good for a while but it doesn't
[1:22:22] stabilize you knowledge is not
[1:22:26] Revelation
[1:22:27] right so I say
[1:22:30] this when you know you should pray then
[1:22:35] pray true true when you know you should
[1:22:39] pray in the spirit don't be satisfied
[1:22:42] with just prayer get in the spirit and
[1:22:45] pray labor to enter into the spirit and
[1:22:48] pray in the spirit when's the last time
[1:22:51] you really forced yourself to get in the
[1:22:54] spirit and
[1:22:58] pray when we know we should love one
[1:23:02] another then get to the place where you
[1:23:05] can love one
[1:23:06] another it's not the knowledge of it
[1:23:08] it's not the quote of it it's not uh so
[1:23:11] is worth 10,000
[1:23:14] worlds get to the place where you're
[1:23:17] living how the value of a
[1:23:20] soul there's a total difference Christ
[1:23:24] stability is
[1:23:27] different than just trying to stabilize
[1:23:30] yourself as a
[1:23:37] person I could invite a brother Mark
[1:23:40] over to my house bring them over to my
[1:23:43] house
[1:23:45] and act like I know all the different
[1:23:52] things about what's in my field all the
[1:23:55] trees all the
[1:23:57] rocks and come across as if I really got
[1:24:01] it
[1:24:04] together and when he leaves talk behind
[1:24:08] his
[1:24:10] back but in his eyes it looks
[1:24:15] stable but
[1:24:17] Christianity that is not
[1:24:20] Christianity are you with
[1:24:23] me all right so if we know we should not
[1:24:26] forsake the assembling of ourselves
[1:24:29] together and all the more as we see that
[1:24:31] day approaching then we need to labor to
[1:24:34] be faithful now obviously that's not to
[1:24:36] you that are here and that's not to
[1:24:37] those that are are sick or
[1:24:39] concerned uh about the co I'm not
[1:24:43] speaking to any of you I'm speaking to
[1:24:46] those who are not afraid to go to church
[1:24:48] but are still not in
[1:24:53] church
[1:24:56] because this word is what establishes
[1:25:00] US believe in the Lord thy God so shall
[1:25:03] you be
[1:25:05] established it's Christian stabilizer
[1:25:08] but if we use our mind we're going to
[1:25:11] become unstable pretty soon we're going
[1:25:13] to miss church and we're going to think
[1:25:16] there's nothing wrong with
[1:25:20] it and that's
[1:25:23] dangerous
[1:25:26] we know we should be reaching out for
[1:25:30] Souls but knowing things does not make
[1:25:32] us
[1:25:34] stable knowledge without love only opens
[1:25:39] the door now listen to this knowledge
[1:25:42] without love only opens the door for
[1:25:46] instability unstable or double-minded
[1:25:49] Minds in other words your love is for
[1:25:53] the world but your knowledge is of
[1:25:57] god you need the love for God to make
[1:26:03] his word become your
[1:26:07] absolute without enough love we won't
[1:26:10] follow the word we won't follow his
[1:26:13] footsteps we won't follow that voice
[1:26:16] that says what we should be
[1:26:20] doing in closing Christian stability
[1:26:24] is not about being
[1:26:28] unshakeable it's not be it's not about
[1:26:31] being in the message for 20
[1:26:35] years it's not about being unmovable
[1:26:39] from your personal
[1:26:42] belief it's about being unmovable in
[1:26:45] your growth with
[1:26:50] God not just growing personally or in
[1:26:54] knowledge but growing God's
[1:26:59] kingdom that's real Christian stability
[1:27:02] because we know we've been taught that
[1:27:05] that is what God's Plan of Redemption is
[1:27:08] that's what God's purpose is he wants to
[1:27:12] build his church he wants not only Peter
[1:27:16] to know who Jesus was but he wanted
[1:27:18] Peter to go tell others who Jesus was so
[1:27:22] he could build his church in them
[1:27:26] brother John give me a scripture for
[1:27:27] that one all right I'm so glad you asked
[1:27:29] 1 Corinthians chapter 15 verse1 15 this
[1:27:32] will be our last scripture 1 Corinthians
[1:27:36] 15:58
[1:27:37] therefore my beloved
[1:27:40] Brethren be ye
[1:27:42] steadfast unmovable but notice there's
[1:27:45] no period there there's no you figure
[1:27:47] out what that
[1:27:48] means no he tells us what that really
[1:27:52] means it means always abounding in the
[1:27:57] work of the
[1:27:59] Lord that doesn't mean well I did work
[1:28:02] last
[1:28:05] month last
[1:28:07] year last week last always abounding in
[1:28:12] the work of the Lord is
[1:28:16] unmovable is steadfast for what the very
[1:28:20] purpose of Christian stability a
[1:28:23] Christian is is always moving
[1:28:25] forward
[1:28:28] always for as much as you know that your
[1:28:31] labor is not in vain in the
[1:28:36] Lord you know the devil will come and
[1:28:38] tell
[1:28:40] you that our labor is always in vain we
[1:28:45] don't see the results we want well that
[1:28:47] wasn't worth
[1:28:48] it maybe the Lord didn't tell you to do
[1:28:51] that so you're just doing that in your
[1:28:53] flesh oh he'll he'll get he'll get you
[1:28:56] to believe
[1:28:58] anything as long as he gets you to stop
[1:29:02] working for the
[1:29:05] Lord personally I want to be guilty of
[1:29:08] this I want to be guilty of telling you
[1:29:11] to
[1:29:12] work work even when you don't hear thus
[1:29:15] sayeth the
[1:29:16] Lord if you're going to air air on that
[1:29:22] side that's that's how brother Brandon
[1:29:24] was he said I can't I can't say the Lord
[1:29:27] told me to do this but he says I can't
[1:29:29] sit around
[1:29:31] waiting in other words occupy until I
[1:29:35] come I want to grade what you did with
[1:29:38] your time off your little vacation your
[1:29:40] little your little Co vacation I want to
[1:29:43] grade what you

[1:29:53] still it's not
[1:29:56] saying my name is John
[1:30:00] Martin I'm
[1:30:03] stable on the
[1:30:05] Rock it's not Christian
[1:30:10] stability Christian stability is the
[1:30:13] ability to keep
[1:30:15] moving to keep moving forward in growth
[1:30:19] despite all the distractions that we
[1:30:22] come across all the work all the
[1:30:25] sickness the family issues the pleasures
[1:30:28] of life the demands of Life the cares of
[1:30:31] life and still moving forward not just
[1:30:35] I'm a rock move forward do something
[1:30:39] with your life that's Christian
[1:30:40] stability that's real Christian
[1:30:44] stability I know you believe I know you
[1:30:48] believe I just say God is calling us
[1:30:51] more to
[1:30:52] believe
[1:30:54] because there's many things God wants to
[1:30:57] reveal to us many things God wants us to
[1:30:59] do but if we get so caught up in our own
[1:31:03] lives and we just have this vision of
[1:31:06] just bringing God in all
[1:31:09] this and forget God's kingdom forget
[1:31:12] about always being abounding in the work
[1:31:14] of the Lord because we just don't got
[1:31:16] time i' I've got so many other things I
[1:31:18] got
[1:31:22] going are you with me all right let's
[1:31:26] Stand

[1:31:39] don't know how many times we've had to
[1:31:41] get new
[1:31:43] stabilizers because you can't control it
[1:31:46] when those things go out you just start
[1:31:49] to shake and you can't direct you can't
[1:31:52] control it
[1:31:55] but when God stabilizes our our walk
[1:31:59] well it doesn't matter what distractions
[1:32:02] are here we don't what trials we're
[1:32:03] going through what problems what's
