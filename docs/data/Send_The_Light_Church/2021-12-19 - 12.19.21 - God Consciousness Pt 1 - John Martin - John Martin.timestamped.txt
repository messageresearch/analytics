[30:11] uh brother
[30:12] timothy o'shawn sends his greetings
[30:16] and also brother samson from india
[30:20] um
[30:23] often when we talk to them they always
[30:25] say
[30:26] send the greetings to the church
[30:29] and it's
[30:30] it's hard every time they say it because
[30:33] we're in contact with so many so often
[30:36] but just so you know that
[30:39] those missionaries that we're supporting
[30:41] overseas they pray for us
[30:43] they love us
[30:45] and they want
[30:46] always
[30:47] us to know that they're praying for us
[30:49] they love us and they're saying their
[30:50] greetings to us so if i say that that
[30:53] way when i miss it it's covered
[30:56] amen we want to re i don't know if it
[30:58] been announced but there's no service
[31:00] next sunday
[31:02] and that our christmas service is this
[31:05] wednesday coming up december 22nd and
[31:07] it's also we're going to have a baptism
[31:11] uh during that that service and
[31:14] we're grateful for what god is doing in
[31:16] our midst amen
[31:18] amen before we begin reading in
[31:20] philippians chapter 2 let's look to the
[31:22] author of this
[31:23] this holy book amen heavenly father we
[31:26] stand here today absolutely unworthy of
[31:30] you
[31:32] lord we thank you that you've given us
[31:34] power to cast out demons
[31:38] and in your name we cast out all demons
[31:41] of unbelief in our life
[31:43] and our
[31:44] thoughts
[31:46] anything that's been contrary

[31:50] we cast that out right now in the name
[31:52] of jesus we thank you've given us
[31:55] that power we cast out all doubts
[31:58] that we may have faith in your word

[32:04] lord
[32:05] lord as we approach your sacred book
[32:08] lord
[32:09] we don't
[32:11] want to to be watered down
[32:14] we want it to be roasted with the holy
[32:16] ghost
[32:17] we want to be able to take this word
[32:19] with revelation we don't want to try to
[32:21] lead our own understanding try to make
[32:23] it fit to the way we think lord we're
[32:25] depending on you to come
[32:27] in your great power and reveal your word
[32:29] to us
[32:31] be with those that are sick and
[32:33] afflicted many not here today because of
[32:36] sickness
[32:38] lord realize that you touch their bodies
[32:39] that you be with them in their homes
[32:42] and lord that you would do a work there
[32:44] inside of them both their bodies their
[32:46] spirits and
[32:48] their hearts and minds lord bless this
[32:50] word now as we look to you

[33:32] on god's consciousness
[33:35] so he wants us to be of one mind let
[33:38] nothing now here is the the mind of god

[33:56] through strife
[33:57] let nothing be done to give you just a
[34:00] little bit of glory personally
[34:04] that's the mind of god but in lowliness
[34:06] of mine
[34:08] take the time to esteem somebody better
[34:10] than yourself
[34:11] and look not every man on hey let's just
[34:14] talk about what i want no
[34:17] uh but every man also on the things of
[34:20] others
[34:21] let this mind be in you which was also
[34:24] in christ jesus
[34:26] who being in
[34:27] in the form of god thought in that
[34:29] robbery to be equal with god but
[34:32] he made himself of no reputation and
[34:34] took upon him the form of a servant was
[34:36] made in the likeness of men and being
[34:39] found in fashion as a man he humbled
[34:41] himself and became obedient unto death
[34:44] even the death of the cross
[34:46] and god bless you may be seated so think
[34:49] that you know a lot of times
[34:51] um you know jesus could jesus could have
[34:53] just walked around said you know i'm god
[34:55] you better listen to me or i'm just
[34:57] gonna wave my magic ron and destroy you
[35:00] no but he became the other part of god
[35:02] which was meek and lowly and humble and
[35:05] a servant the things
[35:06] we don't we god is an invisible spirit
[35:10] and we don't know who he is until we
[35:12] look into the face of jesus christ and
[35:14] then we know the very nature of god
[35:19] and so
[35:20] there's this part of god that
[35:23] he was willing to become
[35:25] because he was all of
[35:27] all of god was poured into jesus
[35:30] right yes and now
[35:34] all that was in christ is being poured
[35:37] into the church
[35:39] and now if i say it like this it is
[35:41] poured into the church
[35:42] but now she's learning to become
[35:46] all of christ
[35:48] in the process
[35:55] god consciousness
[35:59] let this mind
[36:00] be in you
[36:02] which was also in christ jesus
[36:05] human consciousness
[36:07] is the awareness of one's own existence
[36:12] sensations thoughts feelings
[36:15] and the of the surroundings
[36:17] that's human consciousness so we are
[36:20] aware that we're in this church we're
[36:21] sitting by who we're sitting
[36:24] um
[36:25] we
[36:26] know why we came here we know how we're
[36:28] feeling we know the feelings we have the
[36:31] thoughts that we have we're we're we're
[36:34] conscious of a sound mind in that
[36:36] department
[36:38] some people are self-conscious
[36:41] that someone who's extremely
[36:43] or excessively aware of being observed
[36:46] by others
[36:47] like i know you're all observing me
[36:51] but when i become self-conscious that's
[36:53] all i'm thinking about
[36:57] and then there's god consciousness
[37:01] is the acute awareness of the
[37:03] definition is the acute awareness of
[37:05] god's thoughts desires intentions in
[37:08] what's presently happening
[37:13] we can know
[37:14] that god would
[37:16] god it was in god's mind to build an ark
[37:19] to keep it from reigning for so long
[37:21] that made people to just question
[37:22] whether god could make it rain
[37:25] and then he builds the ark and he and he
[37:27] does it
[37:28] but if we were back then we would say
[37:30] god would never do that
[37:33] you know god would never have some
[37:34] people walk around the walls of jericho
[37:36] seven times
[37:37] god would never have some men put a
[37:39] light in a lantern just walk around
[37:43] god would never take 30 000 men and
[37:45] bring it down to 300.
[37:48] god does it is it like that
[37:52] this series is to help us open our mind
[37:55] to more of being god-conscious
[37:58] we need to be more god-conscious
[38:00] how many times have we thought we knew
[38:03] what god wanted and found out that we
[38:05] were wrong
[38:07] many times
[38:09] how many times have we thought god spoke
[38:11] something to us but found out
[38:13] it didn't quite happen that way
[38:16] too often we think that we have god's
[38:18] mind on the subject only to find out
[38:20] that it was just our thoughts
[38:22] or the thoughts that the enemy put in
[38:23] our head
[38:24] satan disguises himself all the time
[38:27] trying to get us confused in our mind in
[38:29] our lives that's his purpose he's trying
[38:32] to get us to confess something that was
[38:35] of god when it wasn't
[38:37] why
[38:39] so our very light can call god a liar
[38:42] see because see satan don't have a
[38:44] problem coming to
[38:45] to god and calling him a liar oh yeah
[38:47] yeah the only reason job's serving you
[38:49] is because you're doing this calling him
[38:52] a liar
[38:53] and he he he wants to get inside of us
[38:55] so we mock the same god
[38:58] come on he's trying to get us
[39:01] comfortable satan's trying to get us
[39:03] comfortable with being double-minded
[39:05] unstable and it really doesn't matter
[39:08] satan don't have a problem
[39:10] with all the thoughts that we get
[39:12] thinking we have the mind of christ when
[39:14] simply we just have our own mind on the
[39:16] subject
[39:20] how many times have you heard people say
[39:22] god told me this
[39:24] and you know it's not even scriptural
[39:29] how can it be god when it's not
[39:31] scriptural
[39:34] we've all had that we've all heard that
[39:36] every single one of us here
[39:39] we've all experienced this so if god
[39:42] has done it in others
[39:44] or or
[39:45] or satan has deceived others that we see
[39:48] it's happening in others who are we to
[39:50] say that it couldn't happen in us
[39:54] thank you for that amen because that's
[39:56] the thing we need to consider where
[39:58] we're at this this sermon is for us
[40:00] amen
[40:02] how could god ever tell us anything that
[40:04] wasn't according to his word
[40:07] oh i'll tell you
[40:11] satan
[40:12] he did it to eve
[40:16] he does it to us if he did it to when
[40:19] there was just adam and eve just two
[40:21] people
[40:22] his own creation how much more would
[40:23] satan try to do it to us he's if he was
[40:25] capable to do it to eve
[40:28] he's much more capable to do it to us
[40:34] and the subject about baptism
[40:36] a man told me one time because the the
[40:38] bible
[40:40] uh
[40:42] if you don't understand
[40:44] the bible correctly it almost sounds
[40:46] like there's two different ways to get
[40:48] baptized according to the bible
[40:50] but there's only one way
[40:52] i had a man tell me one time he said i'd
[40:55] rather take the way that jesus said to
[40:57] get baptized which is father son holy
[40:59] ghost titles
[41:01] verses over how the apostles said
[41:08] but that's the carnality
[41:12] i had another man tell me one time he
[41:14] says it really didn't matter which way
[41:16] you get baptized as long as you get
[41:17] baptized
[41:19] when the bible clearly makes it known to
[41:22] us that there's no other name
[41:24] given among men the name of jesus christ
[41:26] whereby we must be saved
[41:31] people need to be more god conscious
[41:36] some people don't believe in anything of
[41:38] the old testament
[41:40] like it's completely done away with
[41:44] for instance the old testament commands
[41:46] us that we shouldn't commit adultery
[41:52] we can't do away with that
[41:55] the mind of christ never did away with
[41:56] that
[41:57] in fact the mind of christ said in
[41:59] matthew 5 28 here's the mind of christ
[42:03] matthew 5 28 says but i say unto you
[42:05] that whosoever looketh upon a woman to
[42:08] lust after her has committed adultery
[42:12] with
[42:12] her what already
[42:15] in his heart
[42:17] i'll tell you we all should be stoned
[42:21] we all deserve to be stoned right here
[42:23] by the by what christ was saying
[42:26] the new testament magnifies the word of
[42:29] god the mind of god
[42:32] if brother mark got up here and he said
[42:35] you know it's okay to drink liquor and
[42:37] to take recreational drugs
[42:40] we would know
[42:42] that brother mark would not have the
[42:43] mind of god on that subject
[42:48] even though he may think
[42:51] that it's okay
[42:56] man came by when we were working
[42:59] on the church
[43:01] and he was looking for a church that
[43:02] believed in drinking
[43:08] i don't know who was here when that
[43:09] happened
[43:11] but somebody some of you some of
[43:13] somebody was here
[43:15] and uh well he's never been here
[43:18] because we're just not that church
[43:22] we could have a man-made church and we
[43:24] could just decide get together have a
[43:25] committee what would you like this
[43:26] church to be we'll just kick god right
[43:28] out and we'll have church the way you
[43:29] want to have it
[43:32] but there would be no power of god in
[43:35] that church
[43:40] if my wife stood up and said god told me
[43:42] that i was called to be a preacher of
[43:45] the gospel with you and to be a
[43:47] co-pastor with you
[43:50] we would know that she would not have
[43:51] the mind of christ on that subject
[43:56] because god said in genesis chapter 3
[43:58] verse 16 that thy desire shall be to thy
[44:01] husband and he shall rule over thee
[44:06] and if she stood up and said well that's
[44:07] just the old testament we're in the new
[44:09] testament now
[44:12] we would still know that she
[44:14] was not god conscious on the subject why
[44:18] because paul told timothy
[44:20] in first timothy chapter 2 verse 11 let
[44:23] the woman learn in silence
[44:26] but i suffer not
[44:27] in other words i don't allow a woman to
[44:29] teach
[44:31] nor to usurp to take
[44:33] authority over the man but to be in
[44:36] silence
[44:37] for adam was first formed then eve
[44:40] and adam was not deceived but the woman
[44:42] being deceived was in the transgression
[44:45] we can't get any more old testament than
[44:47] that
[44:48] here's paul in the new testament
[44:50] bringing up something to happen in the
[44:52] old testament
[44:55] a lot of believers think
[44:59] they are god conscious about things
[45:02] but when you take it back to the word we
[45:04] learn that it's just satan in disguise
[45:09] why are there times that we wouldn't
[45:11] consider laying down our lives for
[45:13] someone
[45:15] to disciple someone
[45:17] that we have a problem with
[45:20] i'd rather disciple somebody i don't got
[45:22] a problem with
[45:24] why
[45:25] would we not consider it
[45:27] because we're not god conscious
[45:30] enough see how we done we start to make
[45:33] our own personal religion in our church
[45:36] because we are the church
[45:39] god wants us to be
[45:41] god conscious
[45:43] not john
[45:44] conscious not self-conscious
[45:48] not human conscious but god conscious
[45:53] very important thing to remember
[45:55] is be careful
[45:57] be very careful about saying god told
[46:01] me
[46:03] god showed me
[46:06] god revealed to me god
[46:11] i'm not saying don't believe it what i'm
[46:14] saying is be careful about saying it
[46:17] keep it between you and god
[46:20] how many times have we said those things
[46:22] only to learn it wasn't him but yet we
[46:24] just keep doing it
[46:26] we're not learning what we're doing is
[46:29] satan is getting us to
[46:31] mock god
[46:33] that sometimes he's right sometimes he's
[46:36] wrong
[46:37] and to go on as if no big deal
[46:40] oh we just you must not beat him so no
[46:42] big deal but look what we did we
[46:44] testified to somebody
[46:46] we testified to somebody that god was
[46:49] turned out to be a liar
[46:51] and we would never say that would we
[46:53] so be careful about saying that
[46:59] satan uses us as a vessel of god to just
[47:03] mock god and we don't want that
[47:10] branham taught us what god consciousness
[47:11] was when he said that we always should
[47:13] have a spirit that says i could be wrong
[47:18] i could be wrong
[47:23] through this series god will provide all
[47:24] of us an opportunity to become more
[47:27] god-conscious but it's up to us
[47:30] it's not just the knowledge of the truth
[47:32] but it's our behavior and how we handle
[47:34] things
[47:37] the more proud a believer is because
[47:38] we're believers right
[47:40] the more proud we are
[47:43] the more we're going to miss the mind of
[47:45] christ why because god giveth the grace
[47:48] of revelation to the
[47:50] humble we can sit here and say i'm not
[47:53] going to move i'm not going to do
[47:54] nothing you can't br
[47:55] how is god going to help us with a proud
[47:58] spirit
[48:01] but he'll the bible says he gives more
[48:03] grace to the humble
[48:05] lord if this is you talking to me
[48:07] lord
[48:09] show me
[48:10] open my eyes give me revelation
[48:13] amen
[48:14] praise god now we need some more amen
[48:17] today because we're missing some people
[48:18] today so
[48:20] you know what happens um like
[48:24] um when anne is gone on vacation
[48:27] somebody's got to pick up
[48:29] her duties
[48:33] and and so when somebody's missing here
[48:35] we got to pick up their duties
[48:38] and so we need more amens
[48:40] we need to enter into the word amen
[48:45] now
[48:46] when we were born
[48:48] we were born without the mind of god
[48:54] we're not hey we got to say amen quicker
[48:56] because we got a lot of a lot of hay
[48:58] here to to push
[49:00] when i look back at all the stupid
[49:01] things i did in my life how can i say
[49:04] that was the mind of god
[49:06] i was totally nuts i thought it was
[49:07] right
[49:08] when i did it
[49:10] i thought i was cool i felt good i i i
[49:14] got people's attention all the things i
[49:17] did when i was younger i still do
[49:19] sometimes
[49:21] i thought it was right but i was
[49:23] actually nuts you ever steal something
[49:25] you think you're right
[49:28] ever do harm to somebody and think
[49:29] you're right
[49:31] that's nuts
[49:33] ephesians chapter 2 verse 12 says that
[49:35] at that time in our life we were without
[49:38] christ being aliens from the
[49:39] commonwealth of israel and strangers
[49:42] from the covenant of promise having no
[49:44] hope and without god in the world
[49:49] can't get any closer than that we're
[49:51] without christ without god but yet we
[49:53] thought we were right
[49:56] just because we came to christ doesn't
[49:58] mean we spent the whole uh the rest of
[50:01] our the life before then thinking we
[50:03] were wrong wrong wrong wrong wrong wrong
[50:04] wrong i'm so wrong i just need to find
[50:06] christ no we didn't want christ we
[50:08] didn't care about christ we were right
[50:10] just fine don't mind your own business
[50:12] please
[50:14] but the bible tells us that we were
[50:16] without him we without the mind of
[50:18] christ
[50:20] verse 3 of the same chapter says among
[50:23] whom also we all
[50:25] that's all of us here had our
[50:27] conversation in the times past
[50:30] in the lust of our flesh fulfilling the
[50:32] desires of the flesh and look and of the
[50:34] mind
[50:36] and we're by nature children of just
[50:39] fighting with one another to get what
[50:41] you wanted i don't get what i want i'm
[50:42] going to turn you off
[50:46] even as others
[50:50] our very nature abhorred
[50:54] the thought of being submissive to god's
[50:57] will
[50:58] we ran away from it
[51:03] on top of all that
[51:04] we thought we were right when we were
[51:06] doing it
[51:07] how many people are not coming to church
[51:09] today
[51:10] haven't been to church in a while
[51:14] because they simply
[51:15] don't want to come under subjection to
[51:17] the word of god
[51:20] and they think they're right
[51:22] staying home
[51:26] proverbs chapter 21 verse 2 says every
[51:29] way of a man is right in his own eyes
[51:33] but the lord pondereth the hearts
[51:37] i'm so glad that
[51:38] you have enough love in your heart
[51:41] to have god come
[51:44] deal with our hearts today
[51:48] dropping down to ephesians chapter 2
[51:50] verse 4
[51:51] but
[51:52] god who is rich in mercy for his great
[51:54] love for what he loved us even when we
[51:57] were dead in those sins he's quickened
[52:00] us
[52:01] together with
[52:02] christ i like that quickened us together
[52:06] he didn't say quickened us
[52:09] god wants us together
[52:12] he wants us to be a family
[52:15] amen
[52:16] and have raised us up again together and
[52:20] made us sit together in heavenly places
[52:23] in christ jesus
[52:25] when we have been uh he is the blood of
[52:28] christ has made us i just i i think
[52:30] about and if it be the will of god i
[52:32] believe it it is we want to have some
[52:35] some services
[52:37] on parenting and one thing i remember
[52:41] um
[52:43] brother joseph
[52:44] saying to me
[52:47] about
[52:48] how his dad handled
[52:50] uh
[52:52] confusion and things that was trying to
[52:54] take place in his home
[52:58] and he would said brother brandon would
[52:59] just get us
[53:00] and set us down
[53:02] and and just settle us down and he would
[53:04] just
[53:05] set us down and he would just settle us
[53:07] down
[53:08] and he said it like that
[53:10] and that was the end of it
[53:14] settling the spirit
[53:17] you know god just wants us to get
[53:18] together in heavenly places
[53:20] just get with him in heaven
[53:22] everything will be okay if we just get
[53:24] in heavenly places with christ jesus not
[53:27] going off on our own thing got our own
[53:29] things just settle it down instead of
[53:31] everybody going in 13 different
[53:33] directions god this god i'm over no god
[53:36] wants us together unified the same mind
[53:40] let this mind that was in christ be in
[53:42] you
[53:46] and when the holy ghost came upon us our
[53:48] old nature began to die
[53:51] and a new nature began to be quickened
[53:54] romans 8 11 says but if that spirit of
[53:57] but if the spirit of him that raised up
[53:59] jesus from the dead dwells in you he
[54:01] that raised up christ from the dead
[54:03] shall also quicken your mortal bodies
[54:06] by his spirit that dwells in you so god
[54:09] is in this and what is he doing
[54:12] he's working
[54:14] he's quicken us
[54:16] he's making us to be more like him
[54:19] he's just not drawing there and saying
[54:21] i'm there he's not a picture on a wall
[54:24] he's a living god he's quaking in us
[54:26] he's doing a work inside of us not he he
[54:30] just did a work he's doing a work he
[54:32] will do a work
[54:34] it's a process
[54:37] as god's nature is developed old things
[54:39] the bible says is passed away a new
[54:41] thing and all things become new
[54:44] this quickening of the holy ghost i want
[54:46] to say this is the process
[54:48] of
[54:50] being born again
[54:55] we begin to think more like god
[54:58] to obey more god
[55:01] first peter chapter 1 verse 22 says
[55:03] seeing you purified your souls and
[55:05] obeying the truth
[55:07] through the spirit unto
[55:09] unfeigned love of the brothers and see
[55:11] that you love one another
[55:13] fervent
[55:14] with a pure heart fervently
[55:17] so if the holy ghost is inside of us and
[55:19] it automatically happens the seed just
[55:22] comes up automatically
[55:24] which it does
[55:27] it's all god it's not us it's all god
[55:30] but if it is just all god without any of
[55:34] us
[55:35] then why would peter say see that
[55:40] because if we don't see it happening in
[55:42] our life if we don't see that love just
[55:45] coming more and more and laying down our
[55:47] lives for others and
[55:49] and and esteeming others better than
[55:51] ourselves if we don't see that
[55:54] something is wrong
[56:00] verse 23 being born again not of a
[56:02] corruptible seed but incorruptable by
[56:03] the word of god which liveth and abideth
[56:06] forever
[56:11] we're going to get a little
[56:13] a little deeper into what it means to be
[56:15] born again
[56:16] but when we're born again it doesn't
[56:18] mean that everything that we do now is
[56:20] completely of god
[56:23] it doesn't mean everywhere we go god is
[56:25] leading us to go there
[56:28] it doesn't mean everything that we hear
[56:29] it's god telling us
[56:32] it doesn't mean the way we act all the
[56:33] time the way we talk all the time the
[56:35] way we think all the time is god
[56:39] being born again
[56:41] it has a beginning
[56:43] it has a process and don't you ever
[56:46] think it has an end for you
[56:49] that is the biggest problem with saying
[56:51] i'm born again
[56:56] the statement i'm born again can be so
[56:58] deceptive
[57:01] when we say
[57:02] i've got my hunting license
[57:05] i got a car i got a gun i got a bottle
[57:07] of water
[57:09] that's all there is to the subject
[57:12] but when we say we're born again
[57:18] what we ought to be thinking in that
[57:19] statement is god has started to work in
[57:22] us and he's in the process of bringing
[57:24] about his divine nature throughout our
[57:27] lives
[57:29] not oh yeah i'm born again i'm a
[57:32] christian
[57:33] message born again
[57:35] it's like end of deal to god it's not
[57:37] the end of deal
[57:40] job said i will not be satisfied to
[57:42] awaken his likeness
[57:45] the bible says that one day we shall be
[57:47] like him for we shall see him as he is
[57:51] there is a process that we're in the
[57:53] middle of
[57:54] and we need to focus on the things that
[57:56] is not happening in our life that god
[57:58] wants to happen right amen god wants us
[58:01] to focus on getting the things out of
[58:02] her life that we haven't gotten out of i
[58:05] mean he's happy i got rid of my smoking
[58:07] my drugs my rock and roll he's happy
[58:10] with that but there's still things in my
[58:12] life he wants out
[58:16] there's still things he wants in my life
[58:18] in
[58:19] so i'm in the process
[58:22] i'm not saying i haven't been born again
[58:25] but too many of us satan wants us to
[58:27] look at i'm born again then it doesn't
[58:29] matter what you do
[58:31] doesn't matter what you do you're still
[58:32] born i spoke in tongues i got the holy
[58:34] ghost doesn't matter what you do
[58:36] everything is about i'm already there
[58:41] never
[58:42] i'm in the process of becoming more
[58:44] light that should be the the true
[58:46] christian's greatest desire is to grow
[58:49] in grace to grow in this nature to
[58:51] better handle things the way jesus did
[58:56] if that hunger and that thirst for god's
[58:58] righteousness isn't in our lives
[59:01] how are we going to be filled
[59:04] i'll say it like god told the philippian
[59:06] church he which have begun a good work
[59:09] in you shall perform it unto the day of
[59:11] jesus christ
[59:15] the reason that our flesh doesn't like
[59:17] this ministry
[59:19] here
[59:21] is because it simply challenges us too
[59:22] much
[59:25] our flesh wants to feel like it doesn't
[59:27] have to die anymore
[59:29] to do anymore to lay down his life
[59:31] anymore to disciple anymore
[59:34] that's what our flesh wants
[59:36] it always wants to feel good enough
[59:40] i'm already born again enough
[59:45] it's the truth
[59:47] that's why our flesh doesn't like it
[59:50] we like something that makes us feel
[59:52] good well that ain't god consciousness
[59:55] necessarily
[59:56] that could just be human consciousness
[1:00:00] the ministry is not for our flesh that's
[1:00:03] what we need to remember
[1:00:05] as much as we'd like it to be at times
[1:00:08] this ministry here is for the perfecting
[1:00:10] of our character amen
[1:00:12] if i could say it like this it's for the
[1:00:14] perfecting of the new birth
[1:00:17] people don't like to look at it
[1:00:19] as there's anything more than i've been
[1:00:22] born again
[1:00:23] well there was more to
[1:00:25] jesus being born
[1:00:27] then that day in the
[1:00:32] the cave
[1:00:33] there was more
[1:00:35] to jesus than being born
[1:00:39] jesus said or god yeah jesus said for
[1:00:41] god so loved the world that he gave his
[1:00:43] only begotten son
[1:00:45] not just borne him into the world
[1:00:47] he said for this purpose i came
[1:00:49] to give his life
[1:00:53] so there's more to it than just saying
[1:00:54] i'm born again it's the beginning it is
[1:00:58] the beginning of god's nature coming
[1:01:00] inside of you now you're going to become
[1:01:02] obedient
[1:01:04] to the complete will of god
[1:01:07] that's what the new birth is
[1:01:09] and we're going to come back to this
[1:01:10] i'll say very extremely important point
[1:01:14] but i want to get a little bit of
[1:01:16] encouragement in just in case
[1:01:18] we don't get back in time
[1:01:22] what i want to say is don't ever let the
[1:01:24] devil tell you that you cannot have the
[1:01:26] mind of christ
[1:01:29] you're in control of how much you want
[1:01:32] to be god conscious
[1:01:34] we're told in control whether or not the
[1:01:37] mind of christ will operate through us
[1:01:39] or not
[1:01:41] paul said let this mind be in you which
[1:01:44] was also in christ jesus
[1:01:46] let you have control
[1:01:50] you may not know
[1:01:53] what
[1:01:54] god's
[1:01:56] what the outcome is going to be what the
[1:01:57] answer is going to be
[1:01:59] but you know how he wants you to act
[1:02:03] so god told abraham
[1:02:06] i i'm i'm taking you to a land that's
[1:02:09] gonna you're gonna inherit
[1:02:12] the bible says he didn't even know where
[1:02:14] he was going
[1:02:16] he didn't walk around say god told me
[1:02:18] god told me the only thing god told him
[1:02:20] was go
[1:02:22] come out from your p and go
[1:02:24] and he marched in obedience
[1:02:28] in fact he went past where he should
[1:02:30] have went
[1:02:32] and had to come back
[1:02:38] we may not know exactly what god wants
[1:02:41] us to do in everything everywhere about
[1:02:44] every but we know how to act till he
[1:02:46] gets there
[1:02:49] we know how to put one foot on the front
[1:02:50] of the other and say
[1:02:52] i'm gonna be obedient to what you told
[1:02:54] me until you tell me more god has never
[1:02:57] called any of us
[1:02:59] to figure out to be scientists with the
[1:03:01] word of god and try to figure out the
[1:03:04] mind of christ
[1:03:06] no he's looking for obedience
[1:03:09] jesus himself said i do nothing except
[1:03:12] what the father shows me first
[1:03:17] it's very humbling to think like this
[1:03:20] that this is the mind of christ
[1:03:27] we are the only ones that can stop god
[1:03:29] consciousness
[1:03:31] in us
[1:03:32] romans chapter 6 verse 16 says know ye
[1:03:34] not
[1:03:36] that to whom you healed yourself
[1:03:38] servants to obey
[1:03:39] his servant you are to whom you obey
[1:03:41] whether of sin unto death or of
[1:03:44] obedience under righteousness i'll be
[1:03:46] honest with you i have obeyed the devil
[1:03:49] before thinking i was doing the will of
[1:03:52] god
[1:03:54] how disgusting
[1:03:56] for john martin that's for me that's how
[1:03:58] i feel about it
[1:04:04] and i yielded to it
[1:04:07] it was absolutely wrong
[1:04:10] every time we fly off the handle
[1:04:15] every time we want to throw in the towel
[1:04:19] it's not the mind of the lord
[1:04:24] there's a lot to be said
[1:04:26] about letting the mind of christ
[1:04:29] in
[1:04:30] but i want to say the first thing that
[1:04:32] we have to do to let god's mind is we
[1:04:34] have to deny our own mind
[1:04:40] both coexist in our life
[1:04:45] and satan says it's okay that way he's
[1:04:48] okay with both coexisting he believes in
[1:04:50] closest
[1:04:52] but it's not okay with god
[1:04:54] he is not okay with both coexisting
[1:05:05] romans eight verse seven says the carnal
[1:05:06] mind is enmity it god for it is not
[1:05:08] subject to the law of god neither indeed
[1:05:10] can be
[1:05:13] so just being in your flesh can't even
[1:05:15] please god
[1:05:17] it can't coexist
[1:05:20] this is what god wants colossians
[1:05:22] chapter 1 verse 18 jesus christ is the
[1:05:24] head of the body
[1:05:26] which is the church
[1:05:28] who is the beginning of the firstborn of
[1:05:30] the dead that in all things he might
[1:05:33] have the preeminence
[1:05:36] jesus don't want to coexist with our
[1:05:39] carnality with our pride with our
[1:05:42] opinions with the way that we want to do
[1:05:44] things
[1:05:45] our selfish
[1:05:47] nature
[1:05:50] wants total control
[1:05:53] and
[1:05:53] there should be such a love in our heart
[1:05:55] to want god to have control of our lives
[1:06:00] so i want to say that the mind of christ
[1:06:02] is not operational or preeminent in
[1:06:05] every believer
[1:06:10] or every professed believer
[1:06:13] joshua and caleb
[1:06:15] were two people that let the mind of
[1:06:18] christ in them amen
[1:06:20] the other preachers couldn't humble
[1:06:23] themself enough to be willing to suffer
[1:06:25] to do the will of god the will of god
[1:06:27] was go take the land go get the giants
[1:06:29] out i've given you that land
[1:06:33] but they were too proud
[1:06:36] they were too scared
[1:06:38] to be willing to suffer
[1:06:40] that chance you understand you know
[1:06:42] where flesh doesn't want to suffer
[1:06:46] the other preachers viewed themselves as
[1:06:48] grasshoppers in their sight
[1:06:52] and in the sight of the giants
[1:06:55] these other preachers were walking by
[1:06:58] sight
[1:07:00] not by faith
[1:07:01] they were walking in the flesh and not
[1:07:03] in the spirit
[1:07:06] second corinthians chapter 10 verse 3
[1:07:08] says for though we walk in the flesh we
[1:07:10] do not war after the flesh for the
[1:07:12] weapons of our warfare they're not
[1:07:14] carnal
[1:07:15] but they're mighty through god to the
[1:07:17] pulling down of strongholds
[1:07:19] i mean we're dealing with the same
[1:07:21] giants
[1:07:24] they they they look like giants in our
[1:07:28] in our sight how am i going to overcome
[1:07:30] this situation how am i going to
[1:07:32] overcome this bad habit in my life how
[1:07:34] am i going to overcome this flesh this
[1:07:36] carnality this will
[1:07:41] well we're knowing here what to do
[1:07:44] casting down
[1:07:46] imaginations
[1:07:48] and every high thing that exalteth
[1:07:50] itself against the knowledge of god
[1:07:53] and bringing into captivity every
[1:07:55] thought to the obedience of christ now
[1:07:57] that's the mind of god right there
[1:07:59] that's god consciousness
[1:08:01] and having a readiness something about
[1:08:04] you ready get set go and having a
[1:08:07] readiness to revenge all disobedience
[1:08:10] when your obedience is fulfilled
[1:08:14] amen like i come to church i'm ready for
[1:08:17] the word i'm ready i'm so sick and tired
[1:08:20] of what this flesh gets me in
[1:08:22] to it was a real battle for joshua and
[1:08:26] caleb
[1:08:27] they weren't there just sit there
[1:08:29] there's no big thing
[1:08:31] that was a battle
[1:08:32] but they chose the mind of christ they
[1:08:35] let the mind of christ in
[1:08:37] were more than able they said
[1:08:40] they just agreed with the word they
[1:08:43] didn't make a new word up
[1:08:46] they didn't hear a different word they
[1:08:47] heard the same word
[1:08:48] the same word that god told they just
[1:08:50] agreed with it
[1:08:52] they stayed with it
[1:08:56] they didn't question it
[1:09:00] the mind of christ is always doing the
[1:09:03] will of god
[1:09:04] it's having a readiness to revenge all
[1:09:07] disobedience
[1:09:09] and often that includes suffering
[1:09:12] they were willing to suffer
[1:09:16] to see the will of god prevail it was
[1:09:19] the will of god for them to take the
[1:09:20] land
[1:09:21] it wasn't like
[1:09:23] you know we want to we give gifts out at
[1:09:24] christmas right
[1:09:27] and sometimes we get a gift for
[1:09:29] christmas or for our birthday
[1:09:31] that
[1:09:32] you know we kind of turn our nose up a
[1:09:34] little bit
[1:09:36] like what am i going to do with that
[1:09:39] you obviously don't know me
[1:09:44] and they
[1:09:46] the children of israel they looked at
[1:09:48] this promised land as
[1:09:50] you don't really know me i can serve god
[1:09:51] over here
[1:09:52] on this side of jordan
[1:09:56] you can't do that to god's gifts that's
[1:09:58] why when sister cheryl was saying we all
[1:10:00] got gifts god doesn't ever expect us to
[1:10:03] take our gifts and bury him
[1:10:07] he said occupy till i come
[1:10:09] occupy shall i come and give you further
[1:10:12] word
[1:10:21] when we let the mind of christ be in us
[1:10:24] we're not just letting the right
[1:10:26] doctrine in
[1:10:27] but we're letting the right spirit in
[1:10:31] so we can handle the situation the right
[1:10:33] way
[1:10:35] that to me
[1:10:36] is what we need
[1:10:37] the bible says a false balance is an
[1:10:39] abomination to the
[1:10:41] to the lord
[1:10:43] right
[1:10:44] and and and and
[1:10:46] doctrine like strong meat it can choke
[1:10:48] choke you
[1:10:52] what there should be a greater hunger in
[1:10:54] all of us is for the spirit of the
[1:10:56] living god inside of us
[1:10:58] so we can live out our situations the
[1:11:02] right way
[1:11:03] paul said let all things be done
[1:11:04] decently and in order
[1:11:08] that's a very tall order
[1:11:10] that's the mind of christ that's god
[1:11:12] consciousness
[1:11:14] it's not just being right and doctrine
[1:11:15] but right in your spirit
[1:11:18] so that means being humble lowly me
[1:11:20] self-sacrificing obedient merciful
[1:11:22] loving at all times
[1:11:24] so you just let this mind be in you
[1:11:28] except this is the will of god for your
[1:11:29] life not well i know i should be doing
[1:11:31] it's kind of hard something i've been
[1:11:33] growing into the last 30 years
[1:11:36] no you need to start saying as a
[1:11:38] believer
[1:11:39] i believe i can do all things through
[1:11:41] christ who strengthens me
[1:11:43] that i am an overcomer that this is the
[1:11:45] day i put my foot here and take this
[1:11:48] mountain
[1:11:49] you know we want to get uh
[1:11:52] spiritual and religious and and and and
[1:11:55] in in in certain things and other things
[1:11:57] we just kind of push under the rug
[1:12:00] god needs you on the front line living
[1:12:02] the life
[1:12:03] that's where he needs you he don't need
[1:12:05] you in some dark room developing your
[1:12:08] intelligence
[1:12:10] amen
[1:12:15] i want to get back to my point we
[1:12:17] established in our
[1:12:19] earlier net hopefully is going to
[1:12:21] continue next year
[1:12:23] but
[1:12:25] god consciousness
[1:12:27] is that the mind of god will always be
[1:12:29] pressing to manifest all of god's will
[1:12:34] when if i take this statement
[1:12:37] how many believes that god wants you to
[1:12:39] be just like jesus
[1:12:42] how many believes
[1:12:44] that jesus wants you to be just like him
[1:12:48] raise your hand i know you believe it to
[1:12:49] be the truth
[1:12:53] yes
[1:12:54] good scripture be holy even as i am holy
[1:12:57] now the thing is we're not there
[1:13:01] why are we satisfied with that
[1:13:04] why are we content with just i'm in the
[1:13:06] message i believe the word i i believe
[1:13:08] this part of the word
[1:13:11] what about the other part
[1:13:13] their emphasis and our desires needs to
[1:13:16] be there that's the mind of christ let
[1:13:19] the mind that was in christ be in you
[1:13:24] the mind of christ doesn't want us to
[1:13:26] stop after repentance
[1:13:28] or baptism
[1:13:30] he wants us to go on to perfection
[1:13:33] the very characteristic of god's mind is
[1:13:36] not to go halfway
[1:13:39] to be lukewarm
[1:13:40] to be wishy-washy double-minded
[1:13:43] up and down that is not the mind of
[1:13:45] christ
[1:13:46] the mind of christ will always be
[1:13:48] leading us higher than where we're at
[1:13:51] to manifest more than we're manifesting
[1:13:55] not just being in the present truth but
[1:13:58] walking towards the truth that we don't
[1:14:01] have yet
[1:14:02] god didn't stop with me just because i
[1:14:05] got baptized
[1:14:07] just because i found the message
[1:14:10] no the word of god says that when he the
[1:14:12] spirit of truth he will lead and guide
[1:14:14] me into all truth
[1:14:16] now that's not all knowledge of the
[1:14:18] truth
[1:14:19] that's all the nature of the living god
[1:14:22] living in me
[1:14:23] amen
[1:14:26] now in order for that to happen i gotta
[1:14:27] learn to die out
[1:14:29] i gotta learn to say no i'm not doing
[1:14:31] this so god can come in i just thinking
[1:14:34] you know god can't do anything until you
[1:14:35] agree with the word
[1:14:39] god can't help you with your situation
[1:14:41] until you say and i'm so disgusted with
[1:14:42] it i'm done with this i want you god
[1:14:46] and then god can come in
[1:14:49] the bible says the whole creation
[1:14:51] groaneth and travails and pain they're
[1:14:53] waiting for what the manifestation of
[1:14:56] you and me
[1:14:57] not the knowledge
[1:14:59] not for the sons and daughters to get
[1:15:01] the knowledge
[1:15:03] but to get the manifestation of that
[1:15:05] knowledge
[1:15:08] if the whole creation is groaning why
[1:15:10] are we so satisfied with only
[1:15:12] manifesting the little right
[1:15:15] just a question
[1:15:17] just a question
[1:15:28] the more we let the mind of christ
[1:15:29] operate through us
[1:15:31] the more of god's nature will be
[1:15:33] manifested
[1:15:36] the old nature will be dying at the same
[1:15:38] time the new nature will be growing it
[1:15:41] just happens simultaneously
[1:15:45] the old
[1:15:46] nature of strife
[1:15:48] vain glory building our own reputation
[1:15:51] esteeming ourselves will die out
[1:15:54] at the same time the nature of humility
[1:15:58] lowliness will grow into the new mind of
[1:16:02] christ
[1:16:04] being like-minded having the same love
[1:16:06] being a one accord in one mind
[1:16:10] esteeming others more caring about
[1:16:12] others more serving others more loving
[1:16:15] others more
[1:16:16] christ took upon him the form of a
[1:16:19] servant
[1:16:20] amen
[1:16:21] preaching to others is not the form of a
[1:16:24] servant
[1:16:26] that paul was referring to here
[1:16:30] it's not
[1:16:33] jesus did more than become a preacher
[1:16:37] jesus laid down his life for us
[1:16:40] he became a servant to all
[1:16:43] his life preached
[1:16:47] the mind of christ inside of us
[1:16:49] will operate the very same way
[1:16:53] it's not going to change he's the same
[1:16:54] yesterday today and forever
[1:16:56] first john 3 16 hereby perceive ye the
[1:16:59] love of god because he laid down his
[1:17:01] life for us we ought to lay down our
[1:17:03] lives for who
[1:17:06] for who
[1:17:09] brethren
[1:17:11] when's the last time you lay down your
[1:17:12] life for
[1:17:14] your brother think about that
[1:17:17] let this mind be in you
[1:17:20] which was also in christ jesus
[1:17:24] you know the mind of christ is not stuck
[1:17:26] on self
[1:17:29] i tell you if the mind of christ ever
[1:17:31] gets stuck it's stuck on others
[1:17:34] it's stuck on living for others if
[1:17:36] you're going to get stuck ever back in
[1:17:38] the day
[1:17:39] we used to play
[1:17:40] records
[1:17:42] some of you have never seen a record
[1:17:43] before
[1:17:46] but it gets to the one spot and it just
[1:17:48] plays over and over and over and over
[1:17:52] you just get so mad at it
[1:17:58] there's one area that i believe all
[1:17:59] heaven wants us to get stuck on is
[1:18:01] living for others
[1:18:03] just get stuck on it
[1:18:06] now when paul addressed this letter
[1:18:09] to
[1:18:10] the philippian church
[1:18:12] he addresses it
[1:18:14] to the not only to the unbelievers and
[1:18:16] the babes in christ but the bible says
[1:18:19] that he addressed it to the bishops and
[1:18:23] the deacons
[1:18:28] so this let the mind be in you which was
[1:18:30] also in christ he was addressing this to
[1:18:32] the deacons as well as to the bishops
[1:18:36] and he said in verse 6 and i've quoted
[1:18:38] it being confident this very thing he
[1:18:39] which began a good work in you will
[1:18:41] perform it
[1:18:43] he will execute it
[1:18:44] he will complete it until the day of
[1:18:46] jesus christ so he's sending a message
[1:18:50] that is a continuation
[1:18:54] be confident he's going to continue to
[1:18:56] perform the work
[1:19:01] paul didn't believe in just coming out
[1:19:02] of egypt
[1:19:04] or just stopping at the red sea
[1:19:07] paul believed in pressing towards a mark
[1:19:10] and growing into the statue of a perfect
[1:19:12] man the perfecting of the saints he said
[1:19:15] let us go on unto perfection
[1:19:20] not
[1:19:21] can you imagine you're going to go
[1:19:23] brother just take for instance brother
[1:19:25] mark
[1:19:26] is someone i've never met before
[1:19:30] i seen him he just acts so worldly and
[1:19:33] so ungodly
[1:19:35] and i come up to brother mark and i say
[1:19:37] brother mark let's go on to perfection
[1:19:43] he's gonna think i'm crazy and none of
[1:19:44] us witness like that we find out where
[1:19:46] they're at
[1:19:47] we try to work on something a little bit
[1:19:49] lower
[1:19:50] and bring them to that place
[1:19:52] when paul's telling the hebrew church or
[1:19:54] the writer might have been luke
[1:19:58] let us go on to perfection
[1:20:00] he was talking to a mature
[1:20:03] church
[1:20:06] we need to have the mind of let's go
[1:20:08] forward amen
[1:20:10] not just let's hear a word that's more
[1:20:13] forward a new doctrine a new thing to
[1:20:15] make us feel like we got something that
[1:20:17] we didn't have when we didn't come
[1:20:20] but our lives our nature being able to
[1:20:22] live something today that it couldn't
[1:20:24] live yesterday
[1:20:26] that's the perfection that god is
[1:20:28] looking for
[1:20:29] philippians chapter one verse nine this
[1:20:31] i pray so he's speaking to the bishops
[1:20:33] and deacons and all the saints that
[1:20:35] philip he says this i pray that your
[1:20:38] love
[1:20:39] your love
[1:20:40] may abound
[1:20:42] should have brought my ball
[1:20:44] yet more
[1:20:46] and more
[1:20:47] in the knowledge
[1:20:49] and in all judgment
[1:20:52] think about that your love would abound
[1:20:55] in the knowledge and in the judgment
[1:20:59] a lot of times we judge others without
[1:21:01] love
[1:21:04] a lot of times we just eat up knowledge
[1:21:06] without love
[1:21:09] but the message that's being given is
[1:21:10] that our love needs to abound more and
[1:21:12] more in other words i don't care bishops
[1:21:14] and deacons how much love you got you
[1:21:16] need more you need to bound more
[1:21:21] we need to think about manifesting this
[1:21:23] word
[1:21:24] that word abound this means super abound
[1:21:29] think about superman
[1:21:33] you think nobody can do that but
[1:21:34] superman
[1:21:36] super abound only the bride can super
[1:21:38] abound in love
[1:21:40] it's the truth
[1:21:42] only the bride
[1:21:45] will have that
[1:21:49] it means to superbound to excel in
[1:21:51] quality and quantity
[1:21:54] to be excessive to be super fluish
[1:21:58] not just a little more
[1:22:00] and be done with it oh yeah i'll do this
[1:22:02] just be done with it
[1:22:03] i'm sorry that's not the right spirit
[1:22:07] but more and more
[1:22:09] paul told the thessalonian church in
[1:22:11] chapter 4 verse 1 he says furthermore
[1:22:13] then we beseech you brethren and exhort
[1:22:15] you by the lord jesus
[1:22:17] that as you have received of us how you
[1:22:20] ought to walk
[1:22:21] and to please god
[1:22:23] so that ye would abound
[1:22:26] more
[1:22:26] and more
[1:22:28] how many times have you had the spirit
[1:22:31] i know how to walk with god
[1:22:34] i know how to please god
[1:22:36] thinking that
[1:22:38] was enough
[1:22:41] that's human
[1:22:43] consciousness
[1:22:44] but god's consciousness is is we need to
[1:22:46] go on from that
[1:22:49] i know as as a father of my children and
[1:22:52] we just had our like our christmas time
[1:22:54] yesterday and of course you look at your
[1:22:56] children as they as they grow and you
[1:22:59] just get thoughts and
[1:23:01] as a father
[1:23:03] i want all my children to be beyond
[1:23:08] ah
[1:23:09] i'm not gonna it's just in me to see
[1:23:11] them better than me
[1:23:17] i
[1:23:18] i told my son jonathan that
[1:23:21] he thought i was crazy it'd be
[1:23:23] impossible
[1:23:24] i'm sorry i would not let my mind go any
[1:23:27] lower than that
[1:23:29] i won't
[1:23:31] i will believe for what the bible says
[1:23:33] for me to believe
[1:23:36] whether they choose or not that's their
[1:23:38] own business
[1:23:42] god wants us to be just like him
[1:23:47] and he's depending on us to put away our
[1:23:49] flesh
[1:23:54] and the previous chapter chapter 3 verse
[1:23:56] 12 the bible says on the lord make you
[1:23:58] to increase and abound in love one
[1:24:00] toward another and toward all men
[1:24:04] even as we do toward you so to make you
[1:24:09] increase
[1:24:10] and abound in love so when you leave
[1:24:13] church you're supposed to feel like man
[1:24:15] i gotta increase my love i gotta i gotta
[1:24:17] bound in this i gotta give more
[1:24:20] because that's the mind of christ but
[1:24:22] when we come to church
[1:24:24] we've been so down so bad so without
[1:24:28] being in his presence that i just need
[1:24:31] so much encouragement today
[1:24:34] and you know that's great i'm all for
[1:24:36] that but we can't remain there
[1:24:39] we can't remain there
[1:24:42] if we may remain there we're getting
[1:24:44] away
[1:24:45] from being god-conscious from the mind
[1:24:47] of christ
[1:24:49] a lot of times we're in this state we're
[1:24:50] in because we're willingness we're not
[1:24:53] willing to humble ourselves and spend
[1:24:55] time suffering on our knees to get a
[1:24:57] hold of god
[1:24:59] because the bible says they that wait
[1:25:00] upon the lord shall renew their strength
[1:25:02] we come to church for strength but why
[1:25:04] don't we just do what the bible says
[1:25:07] wait on the lord
[1:25:08] well i don't got that kind of time
[1:25:14] we're talking about being god conscious
[1:25:19] verse 10
[1:25:20] philippians chapter 1
[1:25:22] says that ye may approve the things that
[1:25:25] are excellent approve them that's
[1:25:27] excellent
[1:25:29] you did an excellent job
[1:25:37] that ye that ye may be sincere
[1:25:43] approve it that you may be sincere
[1:25:46] and without offense
[1:25:49] how long do i got to do this for
[1:25:52] to the day of jesus christ he doesn't
[1:25:54] want us to be offensive
[1:25:56] i don't know how to do it brother don
[1:25:58] get on your knees get a hold of god
[1:25:59] don't tell me how much you know god be
[1:26:01] god be be god
[1:26:04] we're gonna go through all of our life
[1:26:06] and say i don't know
[1:26:10] i don't think we should say i don't know
[1:26:12] we should be saying really
[1:26:14] i don't want it that bad
[1:26:22] god
[1:26:23] wants us
[1:26:25] to have his mind just let the mind of
[1:26:27] christ start with this is what god wants
[1:26:29] me to do
[1:26:31] i'm ready to to revenge all disobedience
[1:26:34] when this obedience is fulfilled i'm
[1:26:36] casting down every imagination every
[1:26:38] high thought that exalted itself saying
[1:26:40] i can't do it i'm going to take these
[1:26:42] giants i can live the life of christ
[1:26:48] i asked the question today
[1:26:52] without offense
[1:26:55] that you may be sincere
[1:26:58] are you still offending today
[1:27:02] are you still being pretentious
[1:27:06] are you still building your reputation
[1:27:11] i say the mind of god
[1:27:13] we need to super bound in god's love
[1:27:16] we need to excel in in sincerity
[1:27:19] we need to humble ourselves to grow with
[1:27:22] becoming
[1:27:23] more
[1:27:24] born again
[1:27:26] instead of just saying i'm born again
[1:27:29] i'm born again lay off me
[1:27:33] i'm born again i'm being
[1:27:37] more born
[1:27:39] let your word
[1:27:42] be born
[1:27:43] in the stable of my heart
[1:27:50] i don't know if we're going to get
[1:27:51] through all this
[1:27:53] but we just want to take our time
[1:27:55] galatians chapter 3 verse 29
[1:27:58] galatians chapter 3 verse i should say
[1:28:00] verse 24.
[1:28:03] we're going to read through
[1:28:05] galatians
[1:28:07] 4
[1:28:08] 19. just this
[1:28:10] our theme now and our thought
[1:28:12] is
[1:28:13] to have all of christ's nature
[1:28:16] in inside of us and this is the the main
[1:28:18] we're going to be getting into church
[1:28:20] order
[1:28:21] and different things about god's
[1:28:22] consciousness
[1:28:25] but the one thing that i want us to
[1:28:28] establish is as a firm foundation
[1:28:31] well i want us to always number one
[1:28:33] believe that it can happen and number
[1:28:35] two
[1:28:36] that the mind of christ
[1:28:38] is always
[1:28:40] growing
[1:28:42] it's we're just not there we the more we
[1:28:45] can say i need more
[1:28:48] i'm missing
[1:28:49] god help me god fill me god open my eyes
[1:28:53] he told those pharisees he says because
[1:28:56] you say you see you're blind
[1:28:59] if you would say i'm blind and i need
[1:29:01] help then you would see it's an attitude
[1:29:04] thing
[1:29:05] and the quicker we humble ourselves to
[1:29:07] say i just want more of you lord
[1:29:08] nobody's downgrading what we have
[1:29:11] what we're doing is trying to kick out
[1:29:13] the attitude in the spirit that says i
[1:29:15] have enough i'm born again enough
[1:29:18] i'm thankful for that we're all born
[1:29:19] again thankful
[1:29:22] i'm
[1:29:23] believe we're in the process
[1:29:26] don't ever get to the place where you
[1:29:28] think it's ended
[1:29:31] come hungering as much as the first day
[1:29:33] somebody told you about jesus
[1:29:36] because that's where growth can really
[1:29:37] take place galatians chapter 3 verse 24
[1:29:39] wherefore the law was our schoolmaster
[1:29:42] to bring us to unto christ that we might
[1:29:44] be justified
[1:29:46] by faith so it had its purpose right
[1:29:49] but after faith is called we're no
[1:29:50] longer under the schoolmaster
[1:29:53] because what we know the faith is the
[1:29:55] voice of god spoken to us personally
[1:29:57] before the bible the law said do this so
[1:30:00] we don't so we do it don't do that we
[1:30:02] don't do it
[1:30:05] that just brought us to christ
[1:30:09] now
[1:30:10] faith we have faith which is christ
[1:30:12] speaking to us now once christ speaks to
[1:30:15] us it becomes a revelation
[1:30:17] understand
[1:30:19] but after faith has come we're no longer
[1:30:22] under the schoolmaster but you know
[1:30:24] everybody's not there christ has come
[1:30:27] but christ has not come to everybody yet
[1:30:29] that's why some people when they come in
[1:30:32] here they say oh i believe in jesus
[1:30:34] and uh the the the the guy
[1:30:37] like i say a guy comes in here he's got
[1:30:39] long hair he's wearing shorts he's got
[1:30:41] earrings in his ears he's got a a
[1:30:44] a
[1:30:45] a whiskey breath all over him smoke all
[1:30:48] over his clothes and he says i i know
[1:30:51] jesus
[1:30:52] well i'm not going to debate the
[1:30:54] question
[1:30:56] but i know he needs more
[1:30:59] and you know that
[1:31:00] too and you just got to believe that
[1:31:03] there's things in you maybe you don't
[1:31:06] even know yet
[1:31:09] that needs to be more christ
[1:31:12] and when you hear jesus speak the truth
[1:31:15] speak to you
[1:31:16] you'll know then when faith comes and
[1:31:19] speaks for year all the children of god
[1:31:21] by faith in jesus christ for as many of
[1:31:23] you as have been baptized into christ
[1:31:25] you've put on christ
[1:31:27] right by one spirit we're all baptized
[1:31:29] into
[1:31:32] there is neither jew nor greek there's
[1:31:34] neither bond or free there's neither
[1:31:35] male or free meal for all are one in
[1:31:38] christ jesus
[1:31:39] and if he
[1:31:40] be christ then are you abraham's seed
[1:31:43] and errors according to the promise
[1:31:45] chapter 4 verse 1 now i say
[1:31:49] that the heir as long as he's a child
[1:31:52] he's no different than a servant
[1:31:56] though he's heir to be lord of all
[1:31:58] think about that
[1:32:00] so there's a time in our walk with
[1:32:02] christ
[1:32:04] that even though we're a son of god we
[1:32:06] always was the son of god
[1:32:09] we're born again
[1:32:12] we haven't come to the place of maturity
[1:32:15] yet
[1:32:16] are you with me
[1:32:18] but is under tutors and governors until
[1:32:21] the time appointed of who the pastor no
[1:32:28] your time what you think your opinion no
[1:32:32] how many times does your child say oh
[1:32:34] i'm ready for it i can do it
[1:32:38] no it's appointed of the father he's the
[1:32:40] one that tells you when you're ready
[1:32:45] so that word tutors and governors it's
[1:32:47] like a commissioner a manager a guardian
[1:32:50] a steward or an overseer
[1:32:53] even so we when we were children we were
[1:32:57] in bondage on the elements of the world
[1:32:58] but when the fullness of time was come
[1:33:00] god sent forth his son made of a woman
[1:33:02] made under the law to redeem them that
[1:33:04] were under the law that we might receive
[1:33:06] the adoption
[1:33:08] of sons in other words we'll take our
[1:33:11] place
[1:33:12] god sends his son
[1:33:14] into our hearts look at him because your
[1:33:16] sons god has sent forth
[1:33:18] the spirit of his son into your heart so
[1:33:20] what's he doing he's crying abba father
[1:33:23] i belong to you i'm your son i recognize
[1:33:26] my position my place
[1:33:29] wherefore thou
[1:33:30] are no more
[1:33:32] a servant
[1:33:35] but a son
[1:33:39] you've taken a position
[1:33:42] and if a son
[1:33:43] then you're an heir
[1:33:45] through christ right where joint heirs
[1:33:47] were christ
[1:33:48] how be it then now notice this how be it
[1:33:51] then when you knew not god
[1:33:54] you did the service unto them which were
[1:33:57] by nature no gods so when we didn't we
[1:34:01] didn't
[1:34:02] know god we we our whole nature we just
[1:34:06] served our own gods
[1:34:08] but after that ye have known god or
[1:34:11] rather are known of god how turn ye
[1:34:16] again to the weak and beggarly elements
[1:34:21] where
[1:34:22] unto you desire again to be in bondage
[1:34:26] how can we go back in the world and the
[1:34:29] things of just trying to become perfect
[1:34:32] in christ through works or carnality our
[1:34:35] own mindset
[1:34:38] he says you observe days and months and
[1:34:40] times and years i'm afraid of you lest i
[1:34:43] have bestowed upon you labor in vain you
[1:34:45] know you can labor in vain
[1:34:50] paul labored a lot in vain
[1:34:53] in one sense he did he said i became all
[1:34:56] things to all men that i might win
[1:34:58] film but you have to to everybody
[1:35:02] so the other sense is not vain
[1:35:05] but in one sense to the people who the
[1:35:07] people who reject it it's in vain
[1:35:10] to them it really is
[1:35:13] brother and i beseech you be as i am for
[1:35:16] i am as you are
[1:35:18] you have not injured me at all you know
[1:35:20] that through
[1:35:22] infirmity of my flesh i preached the
[1:35:23] gospel unto you at the first in my
[1:35:26] temptation which was in my flesh he
[1:35:28] despised not nor rejected but received
[1:35:30] me as an angel of god even as jesus as
[1:35:33] christ jesus wherein is that blessing
[1:35:35] that she spoke of what happened
[1:35:38] i bear you record that if it had been if
[1:35:41] it had been possible you would have
[1:35:43] plucked out your own eyes and give them
[1:35:44] to me
[1:35:46] so you were at a place in christ that
[1:35:49] you should have been
[1:35:51] what happened to that
[1:35:53] he said am i therefore become your enemy
[1:35:57] because i tell you
[1:36:04] i'll be honest with you that's why i'm
[1:36:06] not afraid if everybody hates me
[1:36:15] if i'm interested in friendship i
[1:36:17] shouldn't be at this pulpit
[1:36:21] that's not what that's for
[1:36:26] i'm so glad
[1:36:27] paul told us the truth i'm so glad
[1:36:29] brother branham told us the truth
[1:36:32] i'm so glad for every man that tells us
[1:36:34] the truth
[1:36:36] they zealously affect you but not well
[1:36:39] yay they would exclude you
[1:36:42] that ye might affect them now he's
[1:36:44] talking about other people
[1:36:46] but it is a good to be zealous and
[1:36:48] affected always in a good thing and not
[1:36:50] only when i'm present with you
[1:36:52] i'll get this next verse my little
[1:36:54] children of whom i travail in birth
[1:36:57] again
[1:36:58] how long how long i've accepted christ
[1:37:01] isn't that good enough no until christ
[1:37:04] be formed in you
[1:37:06] there was an expectation
[1:37:09] that god has
[1:37:11] it's the completion of that new birth
[1:37:13] and it don't say don't ever think that
[1:37:16] it's good enough until you're out of
[1:37:18] here
[1:37:19] cause that's what gets us in trouble
[1:37:20] that's what makes us put down the guard
[1:37:22] and just doesn't matter anymore because
[1:37:24] i'm saved i'm in the message um
[1:37:28] there should be something in every one
[1:37:30] of us that's travailing in birth until
[1:37:32] we see christ formed in us until we see
[1:37:34] christ formed in one another there
[1:37:36] should be one theme among us let christ
[1:37:39] be formed in this more not being
[1:37:41] satisfied with having church
[1:37:44] that's not it
[1:37:47] just could be a domination just go make
[1:37:48] the best entertainment the best church
[1:37:51] you want to have
[1:37:53] god's
[1:37:54] god's mind is for us to be totally
[1:37:56] christ
[1:37:59] wouldn't it be nice if people looked at
[1:38:01] you and they mistake you
[1:38:03] for jesus
[1:38:07] that's what we want that should be our
[1:38:10] goal
[1:38:12] of course we'd correct them wouldn't we
[1:38:17] amen
[1:38:20] it's late
[1:38:22] i want to stop there
[1:38:28] paul said when i was a child
[1:38:32] i thought like a child
[1:38:34] but when i became
[1:38:38] to my place in christ
[1:38:41] i put away childish
[1:38:43] thinking
[1:38:45] human consciousness
[1:38:47] and i became more god-conscious god is
[1:38:50] calling us
[1:38:52] into that realm to be more god-conscious
[1:38:55] not taking away anything where we're at
[1:38:57] praise god for it
[1:38:59] but he's calling us higher
[1:39:02] and the more that we have the attitude
[1:39:04] i know that's where god wants me
[1:39:06] the more we'll hunger for it the more
[1:39:08] we'll thirst for it and i'll tell you
[1:39:09] like this i believe the more we'll get
[1:39:11] revelation of it
[1:39:13] and then the more it'll be manifested
[1:39:15] inside of us and that's what it's all
[1:39:17] it's all about
[1:39:18] i'd rather have be able to live more of
[1:39:21] the life of christ than to ever know any
[1:39:24] more new things
[1:39:30] to live more is so much better than to
[1:39:32] know more
[1:39:34] so when i listen to those tapes it's all
[1:39:36] about living more it ain't about knowing
[1:39:38] more
[1:39:39] brother branham said he what did he say
[1:39:41] about those tapes he said rapturing
[1:39:43] faith lays in the tapes
[1:39:46] it's given us faith
[1:39:49] to get ready
[1:39:51] right because he's coming back for
[1:39:54] himself a bride without spot or wrinkle
[1:39:58] only thing she's taking with her is her
[1:40:00] character
[1:40:03] so it's not
[1:40:05] we're not getting more of this out of
[1:40:08] the message
[1:40:09] we're getting more faith to believe what
[1:40:11] we know to be the truth
[1:40:13] to live that life
[1:40:18] the bible says the bride
[1:40:20] his wife have made herself ready
[1:40:26] that's where you come in you
[1:40:28] he that have this hope in him he
[1:40:30] purifies himself
[1:40:33] he's getting ready let's stand together
[1:40:35] god bless you
[1:40:44] praise the lord
[1:40:46] praise the lord for his wonderful word
[1:40:50] i want to be god conscious
[1:40:58] next time somebody says to you
[1:41:00] um god told me this and you know it's
[1:41:03] not the word it's just right there in
[1:41:04] the word it's an obvious thing and you
[1:41:07] see that happen step back and say
[1:41:10] how could somebody
[1:41:13] be so convinced of something when
[1:41:15] they're so wrong
[1:41:16] it's important to ask that question
[1:41:18] because it happens to us
[1:41:21] it happens to us if it can happen to
[1:41:23] them it can happen to us and it just
[1:41:25] teaches us teaches me to have a humble
[1:41:27] spirit i could be wrong i could be wrong
[1:41:30] the way i'm seeing this and this just
[1:41:32] opens the door for god's mind to come
[1:41:35] into me that's letting the mind of
[1:41:37] christ in
[1:41:39] amen
[1:41:47] to
[1:41:48] be like jesus
[1:41:53] on earth
