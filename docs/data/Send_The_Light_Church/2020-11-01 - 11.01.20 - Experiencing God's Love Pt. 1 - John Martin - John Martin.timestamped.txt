[3:44] for we ask at all and give you the
[3:46] praise in jesus christ precious name
[3:48] amen amen ephesians chapter two
[3:51] starting with verse number one through
[3:53] five
[3:55] amen and you have a
[3:59] quickened who were dead in trespasses
[4:02] and sins
[4:04] wherein in time past ye walked according
[4:08] to the course
[4:09] of this world according to the prince of
[4:12] the power
[4:13] of the air the spirit that now worketh
[4:17] in the children of disobedience
[4:20] among whom also we all had our
[4:22] conversation
[4:23] in times past in the lust of our flesh
[4:27] fulfilling the desires of the flesh and
[4:30] of the mind
[4:31] and we're by nature the children of
[4:34] wrath
[4:34] even as others but god who is
[4:38] rich in mercy for his great love
[4:42] wherewith he loved us even when we were
[4:45] dead
[4:45] and sins have he quickened us together
[4:48] with christ
[4:50] by grace ye are saved amen god bless you
[4:54] may be seated
[4:58] amen the greatest thing
[5:01] a sinner can experience is the love of
[5:05] god being expressed to him
[5:07] through the forgiveness of his sins
[5:12] when god for his great love wherewith he
[5:15] loves a sinner
[5:16] and shares his rich abundant mercy with
[5:19] him his
[5:20] grace saves him amen from
[5:24] god's own wrath and some
[5:27] what a paradox that god's
[5:31] wrath is on man
[5:35] and yet his love saves them from that
[5:37] wrath
[5:39] it's the same god has the same thing
[5:43] he's provided away for every sinner amen
[5:46] the greatest power sinner can experience
[5:49] is receiving
[5:50] the love of god when i grew up
[5:54] i was led to believe that people like
[5:56] charles manson
[5:59] adolf hitler bonnie and clyde
[6:03] joseph stalin
[6:06] saddam hussein were evil
[6:10] horrible people
[6:13] and as long as i didn't steal from other
[6:16] people and i didn't rob banks
[6:19] as long as i didn't murder as long as i
[6:21] wasn't a serial killer
[6:23] i would be okay
[6:26] i would be considered a good person
[6:30] now that's what i was led to believe by
[6:33] my parents
[6:35] by those around me in fact it was so
[6:39] good to hear that you're a good boy
[6:42] just it reinforced it you know what i'm
[6:44] saying
[6:46] but just because i wasn't one of those
[6:47] evil hated
[6:50] hateful people that left
[6:53] blood in the pages of history doesn't
[6:55] mean
[6:56] i wasn't of that same nature
[7:00] that same evil selfish nature
[7:04] i just didn't know it i was blind
[7:08] thinking i was not evil or bad
[7:12] i actually thought i was an okay person
[7:16] but the bible says we all had our
[7:19] conversations in times past
[7:21] in the lust of our flesh fulfilling the
[7:23] desires of our flesh and of our mind
[7:25] and we're by nature the children
[7:28] of wrath in other words when you didn't
[7:32] get what you want
[7:33] you got mad
[7:36] it didn't matter if it was your brother
[7:38] your sister your best friend
[7:40] your mom and dad
[7:43] in your eyes you were number one
[7:46] and when you didn't get what you wanted
[7:48] you let everybody know
[7:52] as a sinner i didn't know god
[7:55] i didn't care about god in fact i didn't
[7:57] even know if there was a god that
[7:59] existed
[8:01] the only reason i thought i was happy
[8:04] was because i didn't realize i was a
[8:06] sinner
[8:07] that i was lost or that i was hopeless
[8:11] i never thought long enough that if god
[8:13] did exist what would he think of me
[8:16] or what would happen to my soul
[8:20] i didn't know that i was born
[8:23] as a beautiful sinner baby
[8:30] they all thought i was a blue-dyed cutie
[8:35] but i didn't know i i was being raised
[8:39] and shapened in iniquity
[8:42] i didn't know it was actually was a bad
[8:45] person that there was no good in me
[8:49] there was no spiritual good in me
[8:51] it was just a selfish nature
[8:54] i was like everyone else who only
[8:58] cared about others to a point
[9:01] and soon as that point got crossed i
[9:04] didn't care anymore
[9:06] in other words it's a conditional point
[9:11] then i learned about god
[9:15] who so loved the world that he gave
[9:18] himself
[9:19] for me
[9:23] i learned that there was no one good
[9:26] there was none not not one jesus himself
[9:28] there's none
[9:29] good but god paul said in romans chapter
[9:33] 3 verse 10
[9:34] as it is written there is none righteous
[9:39] no not one
[9:45] and i don't believe that paul was
[9:47] referring to
[9:50] those people that were outside of the
[9:51] church
[9:56] there is none that understand there is
[9:58] none that seeketh after the god
[10:02] they are all gone out of the way of god
[10:06] they all together become unprofitable
[10:08] for god
[10:09] there is none that doeth good no
[10:13] not one
[10:16] their throat is an open septic septicer
[10:21] with their tongues they have used deceit
[10:26] you got to do that to get what you want
[10:27] you know
[10:30] the poison of ass is under their lips
[10:34] whose mouth is full of cursing and
[10:37] bitterness
[10:39] their feet are swift to shed blood
[10:41] destruction and misery in their ways
[10:44] and the way of peace they have not known
[10:46] there is no
[10:47] fear of god before their eyes
[10:55] i can relate to the scriptures
[10:58] i was spiritually dead in sin
[11:01] in trespasses i was i was selfish i
[11:04] walked
[11:05] according to the course of this world
[11:08] according to the spirit of disobedience
[11:12] i did what my parents told me to do but
[11:14] i wasn't interested in doing wish i
[11:16] didn't have to do it
[11:17] my nature was like that wouldn't tell my
[11:18] dad that he couldn't get beat
[11:22] but that's how i was inside i run to
[11:25] every concert i could get to
[11:28] i bought all the worldly music i could
[11:30] afford
[11:31] i partied and drank and took and sold
[11:34] drugs
[11:36] i gambled and did things that can only
[11:39] come
[11:39] forth from an evil selfish nature
[11:43] come come forth from god and there was
[11:46] no fear of god before my eyes as i
[11:48] fulfilled the desires
[11:50] of my flesh and did what i wanted to do
[11:56] and i i feel okay sharing this with you
[11:59] because
[11:59] i know every one of you we're the same
[12:02] way
[12:05] so you can relate
[12:11] i was in the same boat as all those evil
[12:14] people
[12:15] i learned about when i was younger i was
[12:18] heading for the same place
[12:19] as every other rotten person on the
[12:21] earth was going
[12:23] but god who is rich in mercy for his
[12:26] great love with he
[12:27] loved me he loved me
[12:31] he showed me i was a sinner
[12:36] that's love when god shows you
[12:39] where you've sinned that's love
[12:43] he showed me i was a sinner just like
[12:45] the rest of them
[12:46] i was heading straight to hell
[12:49] he showed me that jesus christ is the
[12:51] only way to end up
[12:53] not going to hell he showed me because
[12:57] he was he loved me with his great love
[13:00] that
[13:00] he was full of mercy he had mercy from
[13:03] me he had grace for me
[13:05] to save me from his wrath
[13:09] the bible says even when we were dead in
[13:12] sins
[13:13] heavy quickness together with christ by
[13:15] grace
[13:16] are you saying i think it's important
[13:18] for us to understand
[13:20] this verse especially for tonight's
[13:22] service
[13:24] so often we think that we're saved
[13:26] because
[13:28] there's something favorable about us
[13:32] something special about us
[13:37] and and yes we are a part of god we were
[13:39] a part of god
[13:40] but you know we need to realize that if
[13:44] that's all we think about
[13:45] then we don't feel so indebted to god
[13:48] but we
[13:49] were without god we were aliens to god
[13:52] we
[13:52] didn't care about god we only wanted
[13:55] what we
[13:55] wanted and god looked beyond that and he
[14:00] said i'm going to
[14:01] die for his sins
[14:06] and that love on a grip or heart
[14:10] the love of god was projected towards me
[14:14] and sovereign grace took over my life
[14:18] mercy rerolled my life i began to
[14:22] experience freedom from my past
[14:24] oh how liberty liberating it was to feel
[14:28] free from sin and i wanted
[14:31] everyone to know his name is jesus
[14:35] he'll be your friend he's human as as
[14:38] well as divine oh i want you to know him
[14:41] this wonderful friend of mine
[14:44] in the message divine love and sovereign
[14:47] grace
[14:48] brother branham said and when divine
[14:50] love
[14:51] has been projected and comes to
[14:54] its end its destination
[14:58] sovereign grace will then take over
[15:03] and in one place he talks about them
[15:05] just paraphrasing
[15:07] but whatever love was projected for
[15:10] grace goes and gets it
[15:12] it finishes the job for god so loved the
[15:15] souls of this world
[15:17] that he projected divine love and gave
[15:20] himself
[15:22] amen greater love have this
[15:27] greater love have no man than this than
[15:30] a man
[15:30] lay down his life for his friends
[15:35] jesus projected the greatest
[15:38] love there is
[15:41] nothing greater and that's why calvary
[15:44] should never
[15:45] feel oh to us
[15:49] yeah i've been saved so long yeah i
[15:50] reckon hey that's old news to me
[15:56] let it stay fresh in your life
[15:59] [Music]
[16:00] he created himself god created himself
[16:04] in the human flesh
[16:06] first timothy chapter 3 verse 16 first
[16:09] timothy chapter 3 verse 16 and without
[16:12] controversy great is the mystery of
[16:14] godliness
[16:16] god was manifested in the flesh
[16:21] john chapter 1 verse 14 and i'm so sorry
[16:24] we got so many scriptures that we're
[16:26] just
[16:26] we kind of need to to go through quickly
[16:30] please for forgive me sometimes it's it
[16:33] just
[16:35] uh i don't make it easy to have like
[16:37] bible study sometimes
[16:39] because i just got so much and you just
[16:41] please bear with me
[16:43] but john chapter 1 verse 14 says and the
[16:45] word
[16:46] was made flesh and dwelt among us
[16:50] and we beheld his glory the glory is the
[16:53] only begotten son full of grace
[16:55] and full of truth and i want us to catch
[16:57] this that god was manifested in the
[16:59] flesh
[17:00] full of grace and full of truth
[17:03] god became man that we might become him
[17:08] what a paradox god became man that we
[17:12] that we might be saved from the raft
[17:15] that is to come god projected his divine
[17:18] love
[17:19] towards us by giving us his only
[17:21] begotten son
[17:23] and when that divine love came to its
[17:26] end
[17:26] came to his destiny yes that love
[17:30] came to its destiny it was on the cross
[17:34] jesus said it is finished
[17:37] you know what happened then sovereign
[17:39] grace took over
[17:41] sovereign grace took over it it met
[17:44] its end love meant its destiny
[17:48] it is purpose jesus come that he might
[17:51] save the world can you say praise the
[17:55] lord
[17:58] now when i was blind to my evil nature
[18:01] and dead in my sins god's sovereign
[18:05] grace
[18:06] took over he quickened me together
[18:09] with christ by grace he saved me amen
[18:14] i met grace when i experienced
[18:18] the love of god
[18:21] and i think we all can say that today we
[18:24] all met
[18:26] grace
[18:28] the love of god was expressed to us
[18:32] because he i don't i do not understand
[18:35] why he didn't save everybody else i knew
[18:40] i talked to a lot of people about god
[18:42] and they just
[18:43] whatever i just
[18:48] why me why get my attention why how is
[18:51] it inside of me that i believe
[18:53] you god that's good why is it
[18:57] everybody else is just like it's a
[19:00] thought it's an idea it's a theory it's
[19:02] a picture it's a story it's a book
[19:04] it's a history why to me is it real lord
[19:07] it's the grace of god today
[19:10] it's the grace of god he gives his eyes
[19:14] to she said blessed are your eyes they
[19:16] see
[19:16] blessed are your ears they hear blessed
[19:18] is your heart it understands
[19:24] the greatest power a sinner can
[19:27] experience
[19:28] is when he receives forgiveness for his
[19:31] sins there's
[19:32] nothing greater he paid a debt
[19:36] he did not all i owed a debt
[19:41] i could not pay i needed someone
[19:44] to wash my sins away
[19:47] and now i sing a brand new song
[19:50] amazing grace all day long that's right
[19:55] never forget calvary amen
[19:58] he paid the debt at calvary
[20:02] he cleansed my soul and set me free
[20:05] i'm glad that jesus did all my sins a
[20:08] race
[20:10] i now can sing a brand new song amazing
[20:12] grace christ
[20:13] jesus paid a debt that i could never
[20:18] pay you know
[20:20] we don't just sing that song the day we
[20:23] get saved
[20:24] [Laughter]
[20:27] we don't sing come into my heart come in
[20:30] today come in to stay
[20:32] you know before we get saved
[20:36] you know we gotta think about the words
[20:37] that we sing in these songs
[20:41] we need to invite more of the love of
[20:44] god into our lives amen
[20:47] now we understand that god loves
[20:48] everybody
[20:50] amen he has no pleasure in the death of
[20:53] the wicked the bible says
[20:55] he even loves his enemies that's
[20:57] something to think about
[20:59] he maketh the sun to rise on the evil
[21:01] and the good and he sentenced reign on
[21:03] the just and the unjust
[21:05] god loves everyone but he doesn't
[21:08] save everyone
[21:12] think about that he loves everyone
[21:16] but he doesn't save everyone
[21:19] first timothy chapter 2 verse 4 who will
[21:22] have
[21:23] all men to be saved and to come to the
[21:26] knowledge
[21:27] of the truth
[21:30] showing the heart of god god wants
[21:32] everyone to be saved
[21:34] he wants everyone to come to this
[21:36] knowledge that you and i
[21:38] enjoy that we praise god every day for
[21:40] the light that has come in this age
[21:43] our eyes to see the scriptures more
[21:45] plainly
[21:48] john chapter 5 verse 39 jesus
[21:53] was giving some very important
[21:56] instructions to the world
[21:58] he says search the scriptures
[22:02] for in them you think
[22:05] you have eternal life
[22:09] but the are what testifies
[22:15] the truth it's the scriptures that's all
[22:18] we have
[22:21] it's like that song that ann sung which
[22:24] i loved
[22:26] i loved the words of that song
[22:29] it's not a tearful motion it's not some
[22:32] man's theology it's the word of god
[22:37] and this word if it doesn't hit
[22:40] inside of our hearts it does no good
[22:44] you can have a thousand of them lined up
[22:46] on your shelves
[22:48] you can literally listen to it
[22:51] daily but if it never enters into the
[22:55] heart it will
[22:55] do you no good
[23:00] that's why we got to search the
[23:01] scriptures
[23:04] now look at verse 40 and
[23:07] ye will not come to me
[23:10] that you might have life see the little
[23:14] ingredient that has to happen to receive
[23:17] more of god's love
[23:18] you actually have to put a step towards
[23:20] him
[23:22] draw nigh to god he'll draw an eye to
[23:24] you
[23:26] come to him and you'll get more
[23:32] i don't think
[23:36] god would ever ever
[23:42] not reward those that diligently seek
[23:44] him
[23:45] the bible said he's a rewarder
[23:48] if we could get time frame out of the of
[23:51] the
[23:52] way like i prayed yesterday nothing
[23:55] happened
[23:56] i prayed for three days now i still
[23:58] haven't heard from him
[24:00] excuse me where's that in the bible i've
[24:03] searched the scriptures
[24:04] and i haven't i haven't found that
[24:06] brother ron
[24:08] i have found that all he does all things
[24:11] beautiful in his time
[24:13] his time not my time
[24:21] can you imagine if those that were in
[24:23] the upper room only stayed for 30 days
[24:25] they left and they said oh that's
[24:26] hogwash he never kept his word
[24:30] he told me to go wait in jerusalem i did
[24:32] he never came
[24:33] they went around told everybody
[24:38] you cannot mix your thoughts with the
[24:40] word of god
[24:42] the word of god says it i believe it
[24:44] amen it's going to happen
[24:47] and we must believe like that as soon as
[24:49] we inject our
[24:50] our thoughts and time and this is the
[24:52] way it's got to go
[24:53] if it don't go like this and i must
[24:57] just stay with the word stay with the
[25:00] word
[25:01] jesus is full of compassion
[25:04] he's full of grace he's full of mercy
[25:07] jesus
[25:08] is today the mercy seat today
[25:12] god loves everyone but he doesn't save
[25:15] everyone romans chapter 9 verse 13
[25:19] as it is written jacob have i loved
[25:22] but esau have i hated
[25:25] now he loves everyone the same so what
[25:28] is this that he hates esau
[25:32] he must be looking at how
[25:36] esau is responding to his love
[25:45] in other words god will change his mind
[25:49] if you don't accept his love
[25:55] he would that all people are going to be
[25:56] saved but they're not going to be
[26:00] so somewhere in that time called grace
[26:02] we've got to respond to his love
[26:05] we've got to say be it unto me according
[26:07] to thy word lord
[26:10] and let that love fill your heart
[26:12] because it will do something to you
[26:16] verse 14 what shall we say then
[26:19] is there unrighteousness with god
[26:23] god forbid for he saith to moses
[26:26] i will have mercy on whom i have mercy
[26:30] and i will have compassion on whom i'll
[26:32] have compassion
[26:33] so then there's not of him that willeth
[26:35] or him that runeth
[26:36] but is god that showeth mercy amen
[26:40] it sounds like to me
[26:44] if you want to find favor with the
[26:45] teacher you better bring an apple
[26:47] class
[26:51] you can't sit around and expect god
[26:54] just to be show favoritism towards you
[26:57] because
[26:57] your name is john martin it just don't
[26:59] work like that
[27:07] the bible says that he dwells
[27:10] among them that are a humble and
[27:12] contrite spirit
[27:15] and he kind of he resists those that are
[27:18] arrogant and proud and got it together
[27:20] and they got
[27:21] you know laodicea is very arrogant and
[27:22] proud they're in need of nothing
[27:25] you can't tell them anything they don't
[27:26] need another leave leave me alone the
[27:28] way i am
[27:30] well god resists that spirit that's why
[27:32] he says i counsel thee
[27:33] to come by of me go try it in the fire
[27:39] get the eyes off so you can see better
[27:41] because you're not looking at things
[27:43] correctly
[27:46] so only god is going to allow us
[27:52] to enter in to a rapture
[27:56] you're not going to grab god and i'm
[27:58] going no matter what
[28:02] no it's god if i'm pleasing to you
[28:05] if i found favor with you if my life
[28:09] is lining up with your word i'm doing
[28:12] everything you told me to do
[28:13] i know i'm not doing everything i know
[28:15] i'm going to go to church and i'm going
[28:17] to learn more what you want me to do
[28:18] lord
[28:20] what we do is when we go to church we
[28:22] you know our flesh wants to make church
[28:25] different than what it's really supposed
[28:26] to be
[28:30] but think about it you're taking the
[28:31] precious time that
[28:33] that you that god has made for him to
[28:36] speak
[28:36] to you about what he wants and you're
[28:39] making it all about
[28:44] what you want
[28:48] you listen to those prophecies that come
[28:50] on brother branham's tapes
[28:51] you notice those prophecies
[28:55] never talk never express
[28:58] never tell the people
[29:02] to just you know really bite in to
[29:05] the discernment and the healings
[29:09] they say listen to my profit
[29:15] listen to the word listen to the message
[29:20] because that is why he sent him
[29:27] we're here today for the word that god
[29:29] has for us
[29:31] and yes we have needs and yes we want
[29:34] god to meet those needs
[29:36] but put him first put him first put his
[29:38] word first
[29:40] all other things will be added amen
[29:45] all right what verse are we on verse 17
[29:49] for the scripture saith unto pharaoh
[29:51] even for this same purpose
[29:52] have i raised thee up that i might show
[29:55] my power in thee
[29:57] and that my name might be declared
[29:59] throughout the earth therefore have ye
[30:01] mercy on whom you have mercy
[30:02] and whom he will hardeneth
[30:05] but i will tell you this that god will
[30:08] never
[30:09] ever manipulate somebody's will
[30:13] god is such a gentleman he will never
[30:15] cross the will of man
[30:19] he has such respect that's why he lets
[30:23] lucifer go let the third of angels you
[30:25] want to go go
[30:28] and he'll let every man that doesn't
[30:30] want to serve him not serve them
[30:34] they won't like the choice they made at
[30:36] the end
[30:38] but he's not going to stop him now
[30:42] it's up to the love of god inside of
[30:44] every one of us
[30:45] to plead with the souls of other people
[30:48] that this is the hour that you have a
[30:50] chance
[30:52] to turn things around because the way
[30:55] that you're thinking
[30:56] the enemy has polluted your mind and
[30:58] thinking that there is no
[31:00] end to this
[31:04] the bible says that in romans chapter or
[31:07] second corinthians chapter four that
[31:09] satan has blinded the minds of them that
[31:12] believe not
[31:16] it's up to us to send light
[31:19] when adam and eve sinned in the
[31:20] beginning the lord god
[31:22] made coats of skin and clothed them
[31:25] can you imagine you ever put on a coat
[31:28] take it off or
[31:29] look at it where it was made who made
[31:32] this where is this made
[31:34] take your shirt can you imagine taking
[31:36] cold off and said made by god
[31:40] god made these clothes for adam and eve
[31:45] he had to take off their man-made
[31:47] clothes
[31:51] put on clothes made by god
[31:54] just like the shoes that the children of
[31:56] israel wore for 50 years
[31:59] those shoes were made by god they were
[32:01] blessed by god
[32:02] if i could say it like that
[32:07] god makes a difference god is able to
[32:10] make his grace abound
[32:12] towards whom whomsoever he chooses
[32:16] and god called them and you know what he
[32:19] did after he clothed them
[32:20] he drove them out of the fellowship
[32:24] and he placed at the east of the garden
[32:26] chairmans
[32:27] and a flaming sword which turned every
[32:31] way to keep them from the tree of life
[32:34] think about it he clothed them
[32:38] he kicked them out he put cherubians and
[32:40] he guarded life
[32:43] he said i'm going to have mercy on whom
[32:44] i'm going to have mercy
[32:47] right there it started in the garden
[32:52] god later made a tabernacle in the
[32:53] mildred wilderness
[32:55] and he placed inside the holiest of
[32:59] holies
[33:00] a mercy seat and he
[33:03] didn't just let anybody go in there and
[33:06] anytime that you went towards that
[33:10] without the blood it would kill you
[33:16] because god is the one that chooses
[33:20] who's going to get mercy
[33:24] you want mercy be merciful you want
[33:27] mercy
[33:28] humble yourself you want more of god
[33:32] search the scriptures
[33:37] i'm so glad that i have the revelation
[33:39] today
[33:40] brother mark that i need more of god
[33:45] amen that i don't have enough
[33:48] what a revelation to have
[33:52] that means i got a chance to get more
[33:55] that's what that means without that
[33:57] you don't have a chance i thought i was
[34:00] saved i thought it was okay
[34:02] i didn't know i was going to hell god
[34:03] had to show me i was a sinner
[34:05] before i realized it
[34:11] a perfect type of god's mercy today
[34:15] is jesus christ man cannot obtain
[34:19] mercy without the blood of calvary
[34:23] and jesus is the only way to obtain
[34:25] mercy from the wrath of god
[34:27] jesus said unless you believe i am he
[34:30] you'll die
[34:31] in your sins unless you believe i am the
[34:34] mercies of god
[34:36] you're going to die in your sins we need
[34:38] to humbly receive him
[34:40] humbly keep receiving more of him i
[34:43] think that's important to get because
[34:45] we all feel here today i've been saved
[34:48] so what's this sermon for
[34:58] come on you know what the devil's going
[34:59] to tell you
[35:02] chapter 1 verse 11
[35:05] he came to his own and his own received
[35:09] him not
[35:11] they turned they turned him down
[35:15] god blinded them to give you and i a
[35:18] chance
[35:22] don't ever look down on the jews
[35:26] if it hadn't been for god's grace you
[35:28] wouldn't be here today
[35:32] look how it happened but as many as
[35:33] received him
[35:35] to them gave the power to become
[35:40] i love that to become the sons of god
[35:46] even to them that believe on his name
[35:49] which were born not
[35:50] of blood nor of the will of the flesh
[35:53] nor of the will of men
[35:54] but of god nobody had anything to do
[35:58] with
[35:58] it mom dad preacher
[36:03] the person that witnessed to you
[36:06] it was god through them think about that
[36:12] this is the amazing thing about god is
[36:14] he's going to share that with you
[36:16] in glory that's right
[36:20] but see because think about this it's
[36:23] not
[36:23] you're not separated from god
[36:27] you're part of god so it's okay they
[36:30] that when souls is wise you're a part of
[36:32] god you're not taking the glory for
[36:34] yourself it has nothing to do with you
[36:35] it's god in you amen that's why we need
[36:39] to
[36:40] he told the disciples to wait till you
[36:42] get endured with power from on high
[36:44] because he i god was saying i know
[36:47] how to win a soul i know what it takes
[36:50] i know how to lay down alive i know how
[36:52] to go to through persecution
[36:54] i know how to keep going and not stop
[36:56] when you're getting eggs thrown at you
[37:00] rotten eggs
[37:04] when god love calls
[37:08] us to himself we need to respond
[37:14] we need to receive that love when god
[37:16] wants to deal with something in our
[37:18] lives
[37:20] we've got to receive that receive that
[37:24] respond to that respond back and say yes
[37:27] god
[37:27] i want to follow what you're saying help
[37:30] me
[37:32] when god wants to build some more
[37:34] character inside of us
[37:36] we need to let go and let god have his
[37:39] way we can't be saying not now lord
[37:42] we don't want to miss our day of
[37:44] visitation our time of visitation
[37:47] we need to take the word of god more
[37:49] serious
[37:50] we need to look beyond flesh we need to
[37:53] look beyond john martin
[37:54] we need to look in the spirit and see
[37:56] god here this morning
[37:59] it's god loving us and it's an honor and
[38:02] a privilege
[38:03] to be loved by god
[38:07] now to you that feel that you're saved
[38:11] and you've already got the love of god
[38:15] i want to say that we backslide
[38:19] every day we come
[38:22] short of god's glory
[38:26] now god just doesn't stand by and do
[38:29] nothing about it
[38:31] when you do that aren't you glad
[38:34] he doesn't just let you do it and stand
[38:36] by and do nothing as if he doesn't care
[38:40] no he cares about you he cares about
[38:43] what you're doing
[38:44] or what you're not doing he cares if
[38:46] you're not praying
[38:48] and he wants to do something about it
[38:52] he deals with us he loves us enough
[38:55] to deal with us to speak to our heart to
[38:58] speak to our conscience
[39:01] and what greater thing could we
[39:03] experience
[39:05] being out of close fellowship with jesus
[39:08] being not connected to that by not
[39:11] bearing the fruit
[39:12] of the holy spirit than god forgiving us
[39:14] of our shortcomings
[39:16] of our sins of our unbelief our
[39:18] iniquities our transgressions
[39:20] what greater thing can we experience
[39:22] than to be forgiven
[39:36] quietly i don't think there's a thing
[39:38] that we could experience any greater
[39:43] when we're out of fellowship
[39:46] is him coming and saying i love you get
[39:49] back in line
[39:54] psalms 19 the great
[39:58] chapter that the prophet took the
[40:01] rapture message from
[40:04] and at the end of this david is speaking
[40:07] in verse 12.
[40:09] psalms chapter 19 verse 12 he said who
[40:11] can understand
[40:13] his heirs
[40:20] wow i don't even understand my errors
[40:27] i you know the obvious if i punch
[40:29] somebody i mean i got it
[40:32] that's a wrong one i shouldn't have done
[40:34] that but what all the other ones that i
[40:36] do and i think it's okay to get away
[40:38] with right
[40:42] who can understand his heirs cleanse
[40:45] thou
[40:46] me from secret
[40:50] faults
[40:53] brother john you mean to tell me you got
[40:55] secret faults
[40:56] no i did it that was david david was
[40:58] saying not me
[41:03] well to be honest with you we all got
[41:05] them
[41:07] we all got them
[41:12] what do i do well let's read
[41:15] keep back thy servant from
[41:20] presumptuous sins
[41:23] and let them not have dominion
[41:27] over me then shall i be upright
[41:31] and i shall be innocent from the great
[41:33] transgression
[41:36] let the words of my mouth the meditation
[41:38] of my heart
[41:39] let it be acceptable in thy sight oh
[41:41] lord
[41:42] you're my strength and you're my
[41:44] redeemer
[41:46] presumptuous you know what that is
[41:49] arrogant
[41:50] proud laodicea
[41:54] not a big deal i'm okay with what i'm
[41:56] doing
[41:57] dave is saying keep me back from that
[42:00] keep me
[42:01] from that let it not not not spirit that
[42:05] attitude have a dominion over me
[42:09] the greatest thing a sinner can ever
[42:11] experience is the love of god being
[42:13] expressed to him
[42:14] through the forgiveness of his sins
[42:18] and and and and david wanted to stay in
[42:21] harmony with god and he knew at any
[42:23] second
[42:24] at any time that could slip
[42:28] i think one place david said i hide thy
[42:30] word in my heart
[42:32] that i not sin against thee
[42:37] when god for his great love we're with
[42:39] he loves a sinner
[42:41] and shares his rich abundant mercy with
[42:45] him
[42:45] his grace saves him from god's own wrath
[42:50] the greatest power a sinner can
[42:52] experience
[42:53] is receiving the love of god
[42:59] jesus said in revelation chapter 3 verse
[43:03] 19
[43:04] as many as i love i rebuke
[43:07] and i chasten be zealous therefore
[43:10] and repent
[43:14] so when god loves you you know what's
[43:16] coming next right
[43:20] god's divine love changes a man
[43:24] it turns them around and gets them going
[43:27] in the right direction
[43:29] now the world wants to be loved without
[43:32] having to change
[43:36] love me the way i am let me do what i
[43:39] want to do
[43:40] let me remain the way i what i i want
[43:43] to be a girl
[43:46] and you better love me
[43:51] that's the way the world thinks
[43:54] they want to be loved without changing
[43:58] we call that human love that's really
[44:01] called human
[44:02] filial love but god's divine
[44:06] agape love never wants you to remain in
[44:09] your corruptable nature
[44:12] he wants us to keep pressing
[44:15] for more and more of his divine nature
[44:18] just to keep pressing
[44:20] not i got enough
[44:24] until i have all i know that i need more
[44:27] what a revelation
[44:30] now god has so much love the bible says
[44:32] that god is love
[44:35] but he's always pointing us closer to
[44:37] him
[44:40] he's always pointing us in a direction
[44:42] that's closer
[44:43] to him he's always watching us with the
[44:47] water by the word
[44:48] his ministry is bringing us to
[44:51] perfection
[44:52] through the guidance of the holy spirit
[44:53] now how does he do it
[44:55] john chapter 16 verse 13 says how be it
[44:57] when the spirit of truth has come he
[44:59] will guide you
[45:00] into all truth and verse 8 says and when
[45:03] he
[45:04] is come he's going to reprove
[45:08] the world of sin and righteousness and
[45:11] of judgment
[45:13] god is leading us
[45:17] to become more of him
[45:20] he is not leading us to more doctrine
[45:26] but to get rid of the world that's
[45:27] inside of us
[45:30] because god's not going to share his
[45:32] glory with the devil
[45:35] that's why we got to die that's why we
[45:37] got to surrender all
[45:39] so we can receive more of god
[45:42] now god loves us so much that he is 100
[45:45] percent of the time
[45:46] guiding us closer to him it doesn't
[45:49] matter what's going on what we're doing
[45:51] his mind is to get us closer to him
[45:55] he speaks the truth in love
[45:59] we repent we turn from the direction
[46:01] that we're moving
[46:03] and we start heading more in his
[46:05] direction i say it like this
[46:06] more in this direction because we're not
[46:09] 100
[46:10] perfectly moving in the right direction
[46:15] that's what the spirit's for you know
[46:18] honestly our flesh can't stomach it
[46:21] he says i have many things to say to you
[46:23] but you can't bear it now why a lot of
[46:24] times people
[46:25] get so fed up with coming to church and
[46:28] hearing that what they need to be doing
[46:30] more
[46:31] because their flesh can't bear it
[46:35] but if they would ever get serious about
[46:37] getting the holy ghost
[46:40] that holy ghost can bear it
[46:44] that holy ghost will lead and guide them
[46:47] into all truth
[46:51] now regardless if you repent or not
[46:55] regardless if you turn around or not god
[46:57] is always
[46:58] pointing people closer to him i want to
[47:01] take a look at the rich young ruler
[47:03] the bible says that jesus had compassion
[47:06] on him
[47:08] and he directed him towards walking in
[47:11] the truth
[47:12] but he turned it down
[47:18] and he walked away
[47:21] from jesus who was full of mercy full of
[47:24] grace
[47:26] full of compassion and he turned him
[47:29] down
[47:30] but what was jesus trying to do now
[47:32] jesus knew
[47:33] what decision he'd make because he's god
[47:37] but he still had compassion on him
[47:41] you know jesus didn't walk away from
[47:44] that situation and say oh
[47:46] well he's not following me i guess he'll
[47:48] just find it down it's you know
[47:50] joe's house
[47:54] he turned down his only chance
[47:57] jesus is the only way the only truth the
[48:00] only life
[48:03] and he comes and speaks to us in many
[48:05] different forms
[48:06] many different ways still the same god
[48:10] you may go by and and and see something
[48:13] you may hear something and all of a
[48:15] sudden god just speaks to your heart you
[48:17] know it's him
[48:18] don't turn it down say yes lord so be it
[48:21] lord
[48:22] i'll i'll follow you lord when a human
[48:26] experiences god's love that love
[48:29] always points him in the right direction
[48:32] now even though god was pointing this
[48:35] rich young ruler in the right direction
[48:38] he rejected it so i'll say it like this
[48:41] it's up to each one of us as individuals
[48:44] to accept god's love to accept his
[48:47] direction
[48:48] and i do believe this that every time we
[48:50] come to church god shows us where we're
[48:52] at on the map
[48:55] we know the rapture is where we're going
[48:59] but he shows us every time we come to
[49:01] church where we're at on the map
[49:04] and we need to know where we're at on
[49:05] the map if we're going to get to where
[49:06] we're going
[49:10] imagine if google maps came up
[49:13] and all it did was point you where the
[49:15] rapture's at
[49:16] but you didn't know where you were at
[49:19] right everything else was just whited
[49:21] out
[49:21] didn't know what city what oh okay i'm
[49:24] in fenton
[49:25] but if all you're knowing is where to go
[49:28] you don't know what state what country
[49:30] nothing
[49:31] so we need to know where we're at in the
[49:33] map in relationship to where we're going
[49:36] that's why we come to church to find out
[49:38] where we're at there
[49:41] this is one of the great mysteries of
[49:43] god's divine love
[49:45] he's always pointing us closer to him to
[49:48] receive more of him
[49:50] if it's just up to us to receive that
[49:53] matthew chapter 9 verse 35 and
[49:56] jesus went about all the cities and
[49:59] villages teaching in their synagogues
[50:01] and preaching
[50:02] the gospel the kingdom and healing every
[50:04] sickness and
[50:05] every disease among the people but
[50:08] something happened
[50:09] when we saw the multitudes
[50:12] he was moved with compassion on them
[50:17] because they fainted and they scattered
[50:20] they were scattered abroad
[50:21] as sheep having no shepherd
[50:24] look how jesus is describing the people
[50:28] the situation there was no leadership
[50:32] for their souls no
[50:35] direction for their souls
[50:39] and today people
[50:42] they think they don't need it
[50:45] it's the saddest thing that's true
[50:48] laodicea is filled with so many people
[50:51] who
[50:51] don't need what you have to offer them
[50:57] the bible tells me that we have this
[51:01] treasure in our earthen vessel we have
[51:04] the words of life they're not our words
[51:06] now
[51:08] they're god's word
[51:11] at one time peter could look at jesus
[51:15] when he asked are you going to leave
[51:16] also and he said thou
[51:18] alone has the words of eternal life
[51:22] but after the day of pentecost
[51:25] peter had the words whatever you might
[51:27] on earth i'll bind in heaven
[51:29] and he could share christ with the
[51:31] people
[51:33] why is it that the attitudes of people
[51:35] today they don't feel they need anything
[51:38] more than what they got
[51:39] they don't realize they're heading down
[51:42] the wrong path
[51:46] lord help us then he saith unto his
[51:49] disciples the harvest
[51:51] truly is plenteous but the laborers are
[51:54] few in other words there's a lot of
[51:55] people out there
[51:57] a lot of people that need leadership for
[51:59] their soul they maybe don't need it for
[52:01] anything else
[52:02] they probably do too but you know
[52:05] what's important is not what job we have
[52:08] how much money we get
[52:11] how many houses we have what matters
[52:14] is that our soul is being led towards
[52:18] christ
[52:19] that's all that matters that means more
[52:22] than all the money you could make
[52:26] whatever you could attain to no matter
[52:28] what popularity and friends and
[52:30] whatever if you don't have that
[52:33] leadership
[52:34] and don't depend on yourself
[52:38] think about this i depended on myself
[52:42] before i knew god and look where that
[52:44] got me
[52:49] ain't that the truth brother ron we
[52:51] thought we were fine
[52:53] just the way we were and you know those
[52:57] religions out there
[52:58] they try to teach you that you're fine
[53:01] you're okay you're gonna make it that's
[53:02] why you don't go to funerals
[53:04] ever go to a funeral and they say you
[53:06] know what
[53:07] this one didn't make it
[53:12] you never go to funeral and here they
[53:14] didn't make it
[53:16] they all make it but it doesn't line up
[53:19] with the word jesus said
[53:21] many go to hell and only a few make it
[53:26] but see the concept that
[53:29] world religion wants us to have is no
[53:31] matter what we do we're going to be okay
[53:34] that's why when you hear that spirit get
[53:36] away from it flee from it
[53:38] flee to the altar and say god fill me
[53:41] with more
[53:42] of you i need more of you
[53:46] he says pray ye therefore the lord of
[53:48] the harvest that he will send forth
[53:50] laborers into his harvest i think we
[53:54] need to pray that
[53:55] i mean i think we need to pray that god
[53:57] would send
[53:58] forth people into the field to get
[54:02] souls now remember god's great love that
[54:05] he had for saul
[54:07] before he became paul jesus said for i
[54:11] will
[54:11] show him how great things he must suffer
[54:14] from my namesake now what is his
[54:16] namesake why did he have to suffer
[54:18] that's his bride
[54:22] the bride takes the name of the
[54:25] bridegroom
[54:27] and he had to suffer many things
[54:30] for for the souls for souls
[54:34] if you're going to get a soul you're
[54:36] going to have to suffer
[54:38] if you think you're going to do it
[54:39] through cards
[54:41] and baking and phone calls
[54:44] and just nice little gestures
[54:49] hey that's what the world does doesn't
[54:51] bring any conviction
[54:54] and i'm not saying a cup of cold water
[54:56] given in the name of the lord
[54:57] will not be unrewarded but what i am
[55:00] saying
[55:00] is you got to be willing to get your
[55:02] hands dirty
[55:04] you got to be willing to get into things
[55:06] in people's lives that they don't want
[55:07] you to get into
[55:09] they don't realize they need to take
[55:11] care of them
[55:13] that's what discipleship is about that's
[55:15] what bringing people to christ is
[55:17] getting people
[55:18] ready for a rapture it was the grace of
[55:21] god that met saul on the road in
[55:23] damascus
[55:25] paul experienced god's love when he got
[55:28] ejected off his high horse
[55:31] what was the first thing that god did he
[55:33] showed him that he was wrong
[55:36] the first thing it's okay when the
[55:39] conviction of the holy spirit comes in
[55:41] church
[55:41] and shows you you're wrong you're right
[55:44] in harmony where god wants you to be
[55:49] because before before you came in
[55:52] you weren't in that harmony you were
[55:55] just fine
[55:56] you know how good it feels having a
[55:58] great week
[55:59] nothing's bothering you you're doing
[56:01] what you want to do
[56:03] why can't it be that way in church well
[56:06] there are churches like that
[56:09] in fact you can leave being entertained
[56:13] you can feel good build up your
[56:16] self-esteem
[56:18] feel like a million bucks
[56:22] be just as much a sinner when you leave
[56:23] probably morsel
[56:26] because you never come into the
[56:27] realization of your need
[56:30] but when you realize the need now you
[56:33] have a chance for the love of god
[56:35] to do a job inside of you because just
[56:38] being loved by god
[56:40] isn't good enough you gotta let it come
[56:43] in
[56:45] let it be expressed inside because it
[56:47] will do something for you
[56:49] god who is rich in mercy for his great
[56:52] love wherewith
[56:53] he loved saul right in the middle of him
[56:57] being part of all the killings
[57:00] he quickened him god quickened him
[57:06] grace came in and took over and saw his
[57:08] life
[57:10] praise the lord that's when grace met
[57:12] saul remember
[57:13] when grace and mercy met the woman that
[57:16] was caught in adultery
[57:19] after the word finished dealing with her
[57:22] accusers
[57:23] in john chapter 8 verse 10 when jesus
[57:26] had lifted up
[57:27] himself and saw that none but the woman
[57:31] he said to her woman where are those
[57:34] thine accusers
[57:36] have no man condemn thee
[57:40] and she answered no man lord and jesus
[57:43] said unto her
[57:46] something these men could have said
[57:50] but they didn't have the love of god in
[57:52] them he says neither do
[57:55] i condemn thee go in sin
[57:58] no more she experienced
[58:02] the love of god when jesus forgave her
[58:09] jesus is full of grace he's full of
[58:12] mercy
[58:12] he's full forgiveness
[58:16] god who is rich in mercy for his great
[58:18] love we're with he loved this woman
[58:21] even when she was in the very act
[58:24] of sin god forgave her
[58:28] think about how rich god's love is
[58:33] the greatest thing a sinner can ever
[58:34] experience is the love of god being
[58:36] expressed
[58:37] to him through the forgiveness
[58:40] of sins no greater power can a sinner
[58:44] experience
[58:45] than when he receives the love of god a
[58:47] sinner
[58:48] as a sinner nothing can compare with
[58:51] being
[58:52] forgiven by god and i'll say we need to
[58:56] experience it more
[58:58] we need to feel like we need it more
[59:01] turn with me if you would to luke
[59:03] chapter 7 verse 36
[59:06] we're just about getting ready to close
[59:09] here
[59:14] i want us to look at the effect of what
[59:16] continual forgiveness
[59:18] happens in a person's life because
[59:20] that's where we're all at
[59:21] right luke chapter 7 verse 36
[59:25] and one of the pharisees desired him
[59:27] that he would eat with him
[59:29] and he went into the pharisees house and
[59:31] sat down
[59:32] to meet and behold a woman in the city
[59:35] which was a sinner when she knew that
[59:38] jesus said at meet in pharisees house
[59:40] brought an alabaster box of an ointment
[59:43] and stood
[59:43] at his feet behind him
[59:47] weeping began to wash his feet with
[59:50] tears and did wipe them
[59:52] with the hairs of her head and kissed
[59:53] his feet and anointed the
[59:55] i'll say it like this i can see this was
[59:57] a perfect
[59:58] setting of humility
[1:00:01] this woman felt unworthy
[1:00:05] to be in the presence of jesus
[1:00:10] now when the pharisee which had bitten
[1:00:13] him
[1:00:14] saw it he spake within himself saying
[1:00:16] this man
[1:00:17] if he were a prophet would have known
[1:00:19] who and what man or woman that
[1:00:21] it is that touch him for she is a sinner
[1:00:27] and jesus answering said unto him
[1:00:31] notice uh
[1:00:34] it was in himself that he was speaking
[1:00:36] these were thoughts
[1:00:41] and the answer simon i have somewhat to
[1:00:43] say
[1:00:44] about the thoughts that you're having
[1:00:48] and he just said pretense okay master
[1:00:51] sayon said there was a certain creditor
[1:00:55] which had two
[1:00:56] debtors the one owed 500 pence in the
[1:01:00] other 50
[1:01:02] and when they had nothing to pay he
[1:01:04] frankly forgave them both
[1:01:07] tell me therefore which of them will
[1:01:09] love him most
[1:01:11] simon answered and said i suppose that
[1:01:14] to he to whom
[1:01:16] he forgave most and he said unto him
[1:01:19] thou
[1:01:20] has rightly judged and he turned to the
[1:01:23] woman
[1:01:24] and said unto simon notice he turned to
[1:01:26] the woman
[1:01:27] and said unto simon sees thou this woman
[1:01:31] i entered into thine house and though
[1:01:33] gave us me no water for my feet
[1:01:36] but she had washed my feet with her
[1:01:39] tears
[1:01:40] and wiped them with the hairs of her
[1:01:42] head
[1:01:45] i think it'd be kind of hard for some of
[1:01:47] these modern day women
[1:01:49] who shave off off their hair
[1:01:54] thou gave us me no kiss but this woman
[1:01:57] since the time i came in have not ceased
[1:02:00] to kiss my feet
[1:02:03] my head with oil thou didst not anoint
[1:02:06] but this woman
[1:02:07] have anointed my feet with ointment
[1:02:10] wherefore i say unto thee her sins
[1:02:14] which were which are many
[1:02:17] are forgiven isn't that wonderful
[1:02:22] now look at this for she
[1:02:25] loved much
[1:02:29] but to whom little is forgiven
[1:02:34] love's little so if we sit around
[1:02:37] thinking all the time
[1:02:39] i don't need to be forgiven i'm okay the
[1:02:42] way i
[1:02:42] am you're just setting yourself up
[1:02:46] to love little
[1:02:49] but the more you can say i need you lord
[1:02:53] i need to be forgiven you're setting
[1:02:55] yourself up
[1:02:56] to be filled with a greater portion of
[1:02:59] god's love
[1:03:01] and he said unto her thy sins are
[1:03:02] forgiven to whom little is for
[1:03:05] littlest forgiven the same loveth little
[1:03:08] look at the effect that of continual
[1:03:12] forgiveness has on a person
[1:03:15] even simon answered correctly
[1:03:18] who didn't have god knows
[1:03:22] that you're gonna love more if you're
[1:03:24] forgiven more
[1:03:25] it's okay to be humble it's okay to be
[1:03:28] needy it's okay to
[1:03:30] just say i i i need you jesus
[1:03:34] you're setting yourself up to love more
[1:03:36] than those people who
[1:03:41] i've already been forgiven my sins are
[1:03:44] in the past
[1:03:48] first john chapter 3 verse 1 behold what
[1:03:52] manner of love the father have destroyed
[1:03:54] upon us that we should be called the
[1:03:56] sons of god therefore the world
[1:03:58] knoweth us not because it knew him not
[1:04:01] now think
[1:04:02] about what manner of love the father has
[1:04:04] put on you
[1:04:07] think about every time that you ask god
[1:04:09] to forgive you and it's not just
[1:04:12] repetition oh it's time to pray god ask
[1:04:15] god to forgive me
[1:04:16] oh yeah no but you feel from your heart
[1:04:20] you feel bad that
[1:04:23] love swelling up inside of you
[1:04:28] your indebtedness to god your
[1:04:29] appreciation to god amen
[1:04:32] romans chapter 4 verse 6 we are closing
[1:04:36] even as david also described the
[1:04:38] blessedness of the man
[1:04:40] unto whom god imputeth
[1:04:44] righteousness without works blessed are
[1:04:47] they whose iniquities are forgiven
[1:04:49] and whose sins are covered
[1:04:53] blessed is the man to whom the lord
[1:04:56] will not impute sin think about that
[1:05:00] god has mercy on whom he's going to have
[1:05:02] mercy god
[1:05:03] is going to love who he's going to love
[1:05:05] when you get time read romans chapter 4
[1:05:08] verse 17-24
[1:05:11] i don't have the time that i would like
[1:05:14] to today
[1:05:15] we're going to get into another part of
[1:05:17] god's love
[1:05:18] this evening so i just want to finish
[1:05:20] this up with three scriptures

[1:05:25] more

[1:05:28] god's love
[1:05:31] i'll say pray for god's love
[1:05:35] pray for more of god's forgiveness
[1:05:40] you need to believe that you'll receive
[1:05:45] romans chapter 5 verse 5 and hope
[1:05:48] maketh not a shame because the love of
[1:05:51] god is shed abroad in our hearts
[1:05:54] by the holy ghost which is given unto us
[1:05:56] we all
[1:05:57] stand here and have hope for more of the
[1:05:59] love of god
