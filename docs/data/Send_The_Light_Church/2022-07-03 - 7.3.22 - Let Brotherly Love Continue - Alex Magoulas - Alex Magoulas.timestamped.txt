[1:00] hallelujah
[1:20] my forgetting to put the mic on i've put
[1:22] my jack and i'm like man i feel ready to
[1:24] go
[1:25] oh i wasn't
[1:26] so but by the grace of god we'll make it
[1:28] here i think so
[1:30] amen
[1:33] you love the lord today
[1:35] amen
[1:36] well you know what i guess uh
[1:39] you hundred some years ago they didn't
[1:40] have a microphone i just have to speak
[1:42] real loud anyhow so but we thank god for
[1:44] the ability to have a microphone and to
[1:46] stream the services and all these things
[1:48] and just anybody under the sound of my
[1:49] voice would like to greet you all thank
[1:51] god for this opportunity to be with you
[1:53] today and we just counted grand
[1:55] privilege uh if you uh if you would with
[1:58] me just let's bow our heads forward a
[2:00] prayer
[2:01] this morning and look to him
[2:04] heavenly father lord we thank you today
[2:06] as we bow our heads and our hearts and
[2:09] reverence to you
[2:10] lord we look down now towards the earth
[2:13] the dust from which we come
[2:16] knowing that we've come from that we
[2:18] must return these bodies they are not
[2:20] fit to live in forever but we thank you
[2:22] lord for a glorious resurrection
[2:25] for those that sleep in christ you've
[2:27] promised that they would rise first and
[2:30] thus which are alive and remain we'd be
[2:32] gathered together to meet you in the air
[2:33] these pesthouses these bodies that we
[2:36] live in with all their frailties and
[2:38] their faults and all the difficulties
[2:40] they give us one day
[2:42] these bodies shall be changed
[2:44] you shall change us from this vile body
[2:47] into a glorious body until
[2:49] likened unto your own and lord as we
[2:52] look unto you now we ask you lord that
[2:54] you just come and speak words of life
[2:56] because we believe that while we're even
[2:58] while we're in these bodies there's
[3:00] quickening power in the word of god
[3:02] today by the spirit of god that it would
[3:05] bring these mortal bodies as the prophet
[3:06] said throw them into subjection to the
[3:09] word lord the spirit of christ if that
[3:12] same spirit lives in us you promised it
[3:14] would quicken these mortal bodies and so
[3:17] i pray that quickening power today the
[3:19] same power that let us see your coming
[3:21] the same power that raised our lord
[3:23] jesus from the grave would speak now to
[3:25] each one lord bless us we pray father do
[3:28] exceeding abundantly above anything we
[3:30] could ask or think lord you know each
[3:32] situation in our lives those little
[3:34] things that lay there lord sometimes
[3:36] that maybe we don't even see i trust
[3:38] that by the word of god you'd come for
[3:40] your word as a discerner of the thoughts
[3:42] and intents of the heart it's quicker
[3:44] it's sharper than any two-edged sword
[3:46] and lord may you come and do that which
[3:48] only you can do and we thank you father
[3:50] we give you all the praise and glory and
[3:52] honor now for we ask all these things in
[3:54] jesus christ's name
[3:55] amen
[3:56] amen uh just take a moment here if you
[3:59] will and we'll look into the book of
[4:01] the
[4:02] hebrews the 13th chapter for a very
[4:04] lengthy reading
[4:06] of one verse
[4:09] you know i i was telling my wife uh you
[4:12] know i was kind of conflicted actually
[4:14] and sister and come back one of the
[4:16] sermon titles i said well i can't give
[4:17] it to you yet because i wasn't quite
[4:19] sure
[4:20] i just felt to go this way i trust to be
[4:22] a blessing to you
[4:24] and so i'm just kind of uh i'm a little
[4:26] out of sorts with it at the moment
[4:27] because i didn't know exactly which
[4:29] direction the lord wanted me to take but
[4:31] i trust this will be a blessing as i
[4:33] said hebrews 13th chapter 13th chapter
[4:36] we'll read the first verse and i'll have
[4:38] you be seated
[4:39] hebrews chapter 13 verse 1 says let
[4:42] brotherly love
[4:44] continue
[4:45] may the lord bless the reading of his
[4:47] word you may be seated
[4:48] if i could take for a very unoriginal
[4:51] title this morning let brotherly love
[4:52] continue we'll speak on that but uh
[4:56] i just uh i think it's important to make
[4:58] a point here you know
[5:00] i've been ministering for several years
[5:02] now i guess and
[5:04] whenever you get to speaking about
[5:05] divine love or brotherly love or
[5:06] whatever
[5:08] it's funny because usually some people
[5:09] have already checked out the door
[5:11] mentally at this point and it may seem
[5:12] like i have myself but i assure you i
[5:14] have not yet taken a leave of my senses
[5:16] i have my faculties i'm just trying to
[5:18] let the coffee kick in a little bit
[5:20] but uh you know you begin to preach
[5:22] about brotherly love or something and
[5:24] people they just kind of check out they
[5:25] say well you know clearly this sermon's
[5:27] about brotherly love and and caring for
[5:30] one another and you know that's just
[5:31] that's just not for me and i'm thinking
[5:33] well it probably is for you if you feel
[5:35] that way
[5:36] so
[5:37] hey man uh you know we're always looking
[5:40] for something that's great and it's
[5:41] supernatural and you know first of all i
[5:44] think it's important to ask you know
[5:45] what is supernatural we assign that term
[5:48] to so many things in our human thinking
[5:50] you realize god doesn't see things as
[5:51] supernatural he just sees them as him
[5:53] doing things because we we make that we
[5:56] look at our natural world we look at the
[5:58] natural order of things we we
[5:59] distinguish natural from supernatural
[6:02] but to god it's just god god the same
[6:04] god that made the natural losses the
[6:05] same one that breaks them or suspends
[6:07] them whenever he wants i should say so
[6:09] for him to part the water that's no
[6:11] harder for him than the rising of the
[6:13] sun or the grass that it's all god to
[6:15] him so we look at supernatural and you
[6:18] know sometimes we think supernatural
[6:20] maybe it's it's just a miracle only and
[6:22] of course the miracle is supernatural
[6:24] amen but we think about supernatural
[6:26] like we come to church and we're going
[6:27] to run around and shout well they do
[6:29] that at rock concerts and in one sense
[6:31] that is supernatural as well because
[6:33] it's the spirit that anoints them to do
[6:34] that that's spirits that anoint people
[6:36] so it's always spirits at play so what i
[6:38] want to really look at is not just
[6:40] supernatural and natural but the idea of
[6:42] of carnal and spiritual what is
[6:43] spiritual amen because sometimes what we
[6:46] look at is supernatural it could be the
[6:48] wrong kind of supernatural if you will
[6:50] so uh but people they shut down say well
[6:52] you know we want to see something
[6:53] supernatural we want to see something
[6:55] powerful and if you've ever if you've
[6:57] ever met someone in your life as a
[6:59] christian you've ever been persecuted if
[7:01] you've ever loved somebody that hated
[7:02] you and you were able to turn the other
[7:04] cheek i assure you that's supernatural
[7:07] you might not have seen any lightning
[7:09] you might not have seen an angel brush
[7:10] by you that day but to have a man you
[7:13] look at christ himself a man hanging on
[7:15] the cross
[7:16] despised and rejected by the world his
[7:18] own father as i preached last time i was
[7:20] here his own father had forsaken him and
[7:22] turned his face away and the earth had
[7:24] rejected him here's a man forsaken by
[7:26] everybody and yet he could look at those
[7:28] sinners he could look at those people
[7:29] say father forgive them for they don't
[7:32] know what they're doing now that didn't
[7:34] look like much to most of the people
[7:36] standing there but that was absolutely
[7:38] supernatural that a man could have that
[7:40] kind of love that that's the that's the
[7:42] the very god the very logos made flesh
[7:46] hanging there having a love for the
[7:48] people that rejected him
[7:50] so if you ever love somebody that hated
[7:51] you and you really love them with the
[7:52] love of god that is supernatural because
[7:54] your flesh can't do that on its own
[7:58] amen and so the reason i i felt to go
[8:01] this way and preach this and and i think
[8:03] about this many times and i think we see
[8:05] it in the world today the world
[8:06] testifies of it that this is the age
[8:08] where the love of many wax is cold
[8:11] and i say this because i'm convinced
[8:13] more and more as i go on as a
[8:15] as a christian you know the the reason
[8:18] people don't see god move in a greater
[8:19] way in their churches it's not a lack of
[8:22] faith we we tend to chalk it up to well
[8:24] you know if these people had more faith
[8:26] if they believed the word of god they'd
[8:27] see more miracles but i believe the
[8:29] faith of the the
[8:31] our apostolic fathers has been restored
[8:32] amen i believe that we can have faith to
[8:35] move mountains but not have charity and
[8:38] so i believe that the the reason that
[8:41] many times we don't see a greater
[8:42] manifestation of what we would call the
[8:44] supernatural or miracles or the the move
[8:46] of god in our lives it's not a lack of
[8:48] faith but it's a lack of love
[8:51] amen galatians 5 6 paul says for in
[8:54] christ in jesus christ neither
[8:56] circumcision availeth anything nor
[8:59] uncircumcision but faith which worketh
[9:02] by love
[9:03] so you can have all this faith bottled
[9:05] up and you have all these potentials but
[9:07] until there's a divine love that's
[9:09] projected there's no sovereign grace the
[9:11] sovereign grace is not able to take over
[9:13] until you project divine love that's up
[9:15] to you and i amen
[9:17] listen we know god loves the world we
[9:19] know god loves us but can god love the
[9:22] other person through you can you allow
[9:25] god to have that preeminence in your
[9:27] life because he's looking for a vessel
[9:29] to operate through
[9:30] amen
[9:32] brother braham says this and i think
[9:33] this is just marvelous he says this in
[9:35] 1955 the way to have fellowship he says
[9:37] listen just a moment he said i would
[9:40] rather have a church now think about
[9:42] this because sometimes we get up here
[9:43] well listen we gotta we gotta we gotta
[9:45] labor on this thought and this we need
[9:47] this brother bam says i would rather
[9:49] have a church that knows nothing about
[9:52] any spiritual gift
[9:54] and just be so in love with each other
[9:56] and with christ i'd rather have that
[9:59] than every spiritual gift operating in
[10:00] the church
[10:02] he said now that might sound hard in a
[10:04] pentecostal group we'll praise the lord
[10:05] well that's not our problem is it
[10:08] well it depends on the church you're
[10:09] preaching i guess he said that might
[10:11] sound hard in a pentecostal group but i
[10:13] would rather have it he says where there
[10:15] is gifts they'll fail
[10:17] where there's gifts will bring confusion
[10:18] where there's gifts they can be
[10:20] questioned but where there is love it is
[10:23] perfect that's right and then he makes
[10:25] this statement this is why i made what i
[10:27] said a moment ago he says and if you had
[10:30] perfect love you'd have perfect gifts
[10:34] that's right so work first with love
[10:37] that brings fellowship and fellowship
[10:39] brings gifts amen so i think many times
[10:42] we have we start with the wrong premise
[10:45] and then we're we're trying to produce
[10:46] something that's like what you need to
[10:48] do is have love for one another
[10:50] because listen if you really love that
[10:52] person and you go to praying for that
[10:53] person and their time they'll be a gift
[10:55] there somewhere for that person
[10:57] because god has already made a provision
[11:00] but can we have the right kind of
[11:01] attitude toward one another
[11:03] amen now we talk and hopefully we do
[11:06] anyway a lot about charity or agape love
[11:09] god's love because this is the capstone
[11:11] age amen we understand the prophet talks
[11:13] about this the adoption series that that
[11:15] perfect love that's the only thing
[11:17] that's in that place he saw beyond the
[11:18] curtain of time perfect love's the only
[11:20] thing he saw there and perfect love is
[11:22] the only thing that'll put you in that
[11:23] place amen so we believe in that but we
[11:26] look at the idea of brotherly love you
[11:27] say well this brotherly love it's
[11:29] something lesser well it's something
[11:31] different
[11:32] amen brother love is something different
[11:33] you know we look at the last church the
[11:36] philadelphian church age according to
[11:38] second peter the first chapter it is the
[11:40] is the church age of brotherly kindness
[11:42] and if you look in the greek it's the
[11:44] exact same word brotherly love brother
[11:46] it's philadelphia philadelphia church
[11:48] age it was the age of philadelphia of
[11:50] brotherly love amen so the same thing as
[11:52] far as the greek is concerned in that
[11:54] context and so why i say this is we
[11:57] understand that charity it's it's of a
[11:59] higher order than brotherly love because
[12:01] it's actually a gift to the church
[12:02] according to first corinthians the 13th
[12:04] chapter charity and faith and hope they
[12:06] abide forever
[12:08] amen but i want you to remember
[12:10] brotherly love is not to cease with the
[12:12] last church age any more than faith or
[12:14] virtue and knowledge in the very text i
[12:15] took let brotherly love continue
[12:18] so it's not to cease it's not to end
[12:20] amen and why i say all these things and
[12:22] why i'm kind of laying a foundation
[12:24] for a moment is you know sometimes
[12:25] brotherly love it looks kind of rough
[12:28] amen
[12:30] you know i i've had people say things
[12:32] before they say well you know these
[12:33] people at church they they care and they
[12:35] squabble on like their brothers or
[12:37] something and i'm like well it's because
[12:38] they're brothers
[12:39] that's why they do that
[12:40] you know if you've ever grown up in a
[12:42] family like brother bram talk about you
[12:43] grew up in a family with a lot of
[12:44] siblings guess what they fight a lot
[12:47] amen that's just the human condition but
[12:49] they're still siblings
[12:51] their disagreement doesn't change their
[12:53] relationship to one another
[12:55] amen
[12:56] and so i say this and i hope you can i
[12:59] hope you can rightly divide how i'm
[13:00] saying because you can go on on a limb
[13:02] with this but this is why i say all this
[13:04] sometimes it is easier to have love
[13:08] or mercy or compassion for a person you
[13:10] don't know
[13:12] you see what i mean when it's like i
[13:14] talk about with jesus you see a sinner
[13:16] in their condition maybe they're hostile
[13:18] to you maybe they've called you every
[13:19] kind of name they've rejected you but
[13:21] you know what the love of god he says
[13:22] well that person they don't know better
[13:24] they're they're a sinner and they need
[13:25] me to pray for him you turn the other
[13:27] cheek because you feel bad
[13:29] but when you know somebody
[13:32] and you know their fault you know
[13:33] there's that old there's an old saying
[13:34] familiarity breeds contempt have you
[13:36] ever heard that saying
[13:38] it's true
[13:39] many times there's a lot of truth to it
[13:40] when you're familiar with people you see
[13:42] the same people all the time you see
[13:44] their humanity you see their faults and
[13:46] their failures and you've got to maybe
[13:47] deal with them every day that can be
[13:49] much harder sometimes to be gracious to
[13:51] that person because you're sitting there
[13:53] going well they should know better i've
[13:54] told them 30 times why they're wrong
[13:56] they should know that i'm right right
[13:57] now
[13:58] and it becomes harder many times to have
[14:01] a care for that person than the person
[14:03] on the street because you know that
[14:05] person maybe too well
[14:06] maybe they know you too well you know
[14:08] you learn how to push one another's
[14:10] buttons you know exactly what to say to
[14:12] somebody amen and listen if we're not
[14:14] careful when you know somebody that's
[14:16] when it becomes very dangerous because
[14:18] you know how to when when you see a
[14:20] weakness or you see something in their
[14:22] life that's wrong you know what that is
[14:24] and if you don't have brotherly love
[14:26] you'll exploit that
[14:29] you see a lot of times in a marriage if
[14:30] two people
[14:31] you know uh this isn't marriage
[14:33] counseling but maybe this will help
[14:34] somebody i guess a lot of times in a
[14:36] marriage a relationship to people when
[14:38] they become adversarial toward one
[14:40] another
[14:41] most of the time in a marriage
[14:43] when when communication breaks down or
[14:45] something begins to happen the initial
[14:47] issue is the premise is completely wrong
[14:49] they begin to look at one another as
[14:51] adversaries
[14:52] well you know it's like i was talking to
[14:54] um i don't want to say too much i was
[14:57] talking to somebody one time about a
[14:58] certain situation their marriage and
[15:00] with their spouse they would do a
[15:01] certain thing i said well the reason
[15:03] they do this is because they feel this
[15:04] way and they don't want to tell you
[15:06] about it i said now listen if if you're
[15:08] that person's enemy you'll take
[15:09] advantage of that and you'll point it
[15:10] out and rub it in their face but if you
[15:12] love that person you'll recognize
[15:14] they're actually telling you they need
[15:15] help and you'll be gracious to them
[15:18] and so the entire basis is are we on the
[15:20] same page are we adversaries listen if
[15:22] we're brothers and sisters we're not
[15:24] looking to exploit one another's
[15:26] weakness we're not looking to take a
[15:28] situation and we see a weakness in one
[15:30] another's lives and and use it to our
[15:32] advantage
[15:34] and many times it plays out right in the
[15:36] church because one of us has to be right
[15:38] and everybody else has to be wrong and i
[15:39] think that many times is why there's
[15:41] such a breakdown in assemblies or
[15:43] churches or families or marriages they
[15:45] don't let brother love continue we get
[15:47] to know one another too well
[15:49] and that becomes the problem many times
[15:52] amen well listen if we're all
[15:55] i thought maybe we'd have more laughing
[15:57] we're all like man this guy's just
[15:58] laying out here heavy
[15:59] well that's we all we all fight with him
[16:02] listen even jesus and his disciples did
[16:04] it listen peter goes up to jesus one day
[16:06] and the bible says that peter rebuked
[16:08] jesus here's the lord
[16:11] this is jesus this guy has multiplied
[16:14] loaves and fishes he's raised the dead
[16:17] he's healed the sick he's open blinded
[16:19] eyes he tells the disciples you know
[16:21] what i'm going to go up to jerusalem and
[16:22] that and peter he the bible says he
[16:25] rebukes him oh lord you're not going to
[16:27] do that now
[16:28] i'm like man who are you we know we say
[16:30] who are we to tell the lord what to do
[16:32] well peter was so so familiar with jesus
[16:35] listen these guys spent every waking
[16:36] moment together
[16:38] they were just together all the time and
[16:40] peter rebukes him and the bible says
[16:42] jesus rebicked him right back satan get
[16:44] behind me
[16:46] listen it's just normal we can all
[16:48] lighten up a little bit i'm not here to
[16:50] condemn you i'm saying it's normal
[16:52] it's normal
[16:54] don't don't feel like you're oh well you
[16:56] know i just you know i there's this guy
[16:58] he just drives me nuts well listen
[17:00] there's there's people like that
[17:02] and you're gonna deal with them but your
[17:04] ability to love them anyway is what's
[17:06] gonna it's gonna make the difference
[17:08] because you probably do something
[17:10] praise the lord
[17:11] it's like
[17:12] another situation you know i was talking
[17:14] to a couple and the one the one come to
[17:16] me and said well you know you know this
[17:17] this that said do you think your spouse
[17:19] is hard to live with and and the
[17:21] person's like well yeah a little bit
[17:23] sometimes like well do you think that
[17:24] maybe you're hard to live with
[17:27] yeah i probably am even more exactly
[17:31] some somebody somewhere is forbearing
[17:33] with us probably
[17:35] not not me obviously but other people
[17:39] but you know you look even in the bible
[17:40] in the early church you look at the
[17:41] first six chapters of the book of acts
[17:44] when the church comes together and god
[17:45] pours out the holy ghost they're all
[17:47] together in one spirit and one accord
[17:49] even after the holy ghost falls in acts
[17:51] chapter two the bible said they contin
[17:53] they were continuing one accord and they
[17:55] were in singleness of heart and then one
[17:57] day there arose a murmuring among uh the
[18:00] different widows because they were
[18:02] neglected in the daily administration
[18:04] now listen that didn't de-christianize
[18:06] them because they had a complaint
[18:09] amen because sometimes people present
[18:11] that way well listen if you don't agree
[18:13] with me and you don't see it exactly the
[18:14] way i see it you're just not as
[18:16] spiritual as me you shouldn't be upset
[18:18] about that well they were upset about it
[18:20] you know what the disciples did they did
[18:21] something about it
[18:23] they didn't say well listen we these
[18:25] women ought to know not to complain
[18:27] they're just a bunch of women what are
[18:28] they not that's not what they did they
[18:30] said you know what we'll set some men
[18:32] over the church and we'll deal with it
[18:36] because sometimes the only way to deal
[18:37] with the situation is to bring it up in
[18:39] the first place
[18:44] so i i forget how it goes nicola
[18:46] machiavelli made a quote but he made he
[18:48] makes the point that the the best way to
[18:50] guard yourself against flattery is to
[18:52] let people know that you won't offend
[18:54] them with the truth amen if if we're not
[18:57] careful we present where we're always
[18:59] offended by everything well you
[19:00] shouldn't bring that up to me and you
[19:01] shouldn't complain if you cultivate that
[19:03] kind of attitude nobody will talk to you
[19:05] anymore
[19:08] so we don't want to we don't see because
[19:10] this and this is kind of the point i'm
[19:11] trying to build too you have to foster
[19:13] brotherly love you have to foster
[19:15] fraternity you have to work at it
[19:18] hey man it doesn't always seem
[19:19] supernatural but this is something you
[19:21] have to listen paul spends a great deal
[19:23] of time telling the ephesian church the
[19:25] most spiritual orderly church that was
[19:28] in the the first church age he speaks
[19:30] the ephesian church and he lets them
[19:31] know you husbands now make sure you love
[19:33] your wives
[19:35] amen your wives make sure you submit to
[19:37] your husbands why is he going to remind
[19:39] him this because the breakdown in the
[19:41] home the breakdown in our relationships
[19:43] is where satan wants to enter into the
[19:45] church that's why the prophet warns the
[19:47] church when something rises up you stick
[19:49] that much more close together
[19:52] it's not a matter of saying well i'll
[19:54] just go here and do my own thing or i'll
[19:55] go there the breakdown is going to
[19:57] affect our spiritual condition
[20:00] it's going to affect our ability to be
[20:01] used by god
[20:03] because we're going to begin to look at
[20:05] other people with the wrong kind of
[20:06] cynicism
[20:08] listen if somebody has a disagreement or
[20:11] whatever with you that doesn't make them
[20:13] not a christian or you a christian
[20:14] you're allowed to have disagreements and
[20:16] still come together
[20:19] listen they had a disagreement that
[20:21] didn't break their one accord their
[20:23] fellowship
[20:24] this is what i'm trying to say this idea
[20:25] of being in one accord it's not that we
[20:27] all agree on every little thing
[20:30] you know i think that fords are the best
[20:32] well you're an idiot
[20:34] well i think the chevys are the best i
[20:36] don't know who that is and i met one one
[20:38] time
[20:40] you know i could go on about ohio state
[20:41] michigan i'm not going to do that right
[20:42] now
[20:44] but the point is being a one of course
[20:45] not we agree on every single little
[20:47] thing we like the same food on our pizza
[20:49] that's not what it's talking about we
[20:51] can disagree we can see things different
[20:53] and still be one accord on the word
[20:57] it doesn't have to break our fellowship
[21:00] hey man we're not a bunch of cookie
[21:01] cutters we
[21:03] we do what they did there they they had
[21:05] an issue they sat down and worked it out
[21:11] now you say well again that doesn't seem
[21:12] real
[21:13] supernatural well i would tend to agree
[21:15] with you except we look at the society
[21:17] we live in today a people without
[21:19] natural affection they're incontinent
[21:21] they're fierce they're they're truce
[21:22] breakers they're despises the parents
[21:24] they're haters of things that are good
[21:26] we see the world in an insane condition
[21:28] and for you to have a what we would what
[21:30] was once called a normal you can't even
[21:32] call it normal now because that implies
[21:33] the rest is abnormal what is that normal
[21:36] it's not according to the plan of god we
[21:39] see breakdowns in homes and in brotherly
[21:41] kindness towards one another and then we
[21:43] wonder why the world's in a neurotic
[21:44] condition
[21:46] that's why it's there a breakdown even
[21:49] the natural affection toward one another
[21:53] amen i love how brother brown talks
[21:55] about it because he said you know then
[21:57] branhams he said you know we had some
[21:59] that were tall and some that were short
[22:00] and some that were fat and some were fit
[22:02] thin and when the brands got together in
[22:04] the backyard guess what they did
[22:06] they weren't roasting weenies on the
[22:08] grill
[22:09] they weren't cooking burgers for the
[22:10] fourth of july they were fighting with
[22:12] one another
[22:14] that's what they did when they got
[22:15] together why because they were family
[22:17] but guess what happened as soon as i
[22:19] went in the front yard
[22:20] he said you messed with one of them
[22:22] brandon said watch out
[22:25] so listen we can we can fight in the
[22:26] backyard that doesn't mean we're not
[22:29] family up front we're still family in
[22:31] the backyard
[22:33] and i i fear so many times we live in
[22:35] this we live in a society where we're so
[22:36] offended by everything
[22:38] and then we're offended that they're
[22:39] offended
[22:43] well these people
[22:44] praise the lord stay off social media
[22:47] you know you look at the political
[22:49] climate and everything has changed and
[22:51] all these people are offended by what's
[22:52] happened and then the christians are
[22:54] offended they're offended why do you
[22:55] care if they're offended
[22:57] they're always a listen we
[23:00] praise god well here i am i'm going off
[23:02] the rails we're just shooting from the
[23:04] hip now
[23:05] praise the lord amen listen we look at
[23:07] our society uh you know it's like i was
[23:09] talking to a brother one time we look at
[23:10] our society we look at the moral
[23:12] breakdown of our society and we look at
[23:14] how wayward this nation is from what it
[23:16] used to be and i agree it's awful i
[23:18] agree it's a bad thing but listen we're
[23:20] not the first christians to ever live in
[23:22] a godless nation
[23:25] can we get real for a second listen you
[23:26] look at the corinthian church corinth
[23:28] was the worst of the worst of the
[23:30] heathen world and there was people there
[23:33] that believed
[23:34] and we say well listen if i if the ten
[23:36] commandments aren't in the courthouse
[23:38] and i don't see i don't see churches
[23:40] everywhere this country's falling apart
[23:42] how am i gonna raise my children to
[23:44] serve god you're probably gonna have to
[23:45] raise them the same way they did back
[23:47] there
[23:48] you're probably gonna have to trust in
[23:49] god's grace that the mercy of god in
[23:51] your life is greater than the power of
[23:53] the world greater is he that's in you
[23:57] ah but the whole world is funneled by
[23:58] they don't believe anymore so what that
[24:01] shouldn't change where you stand
[24:05] well they took prayer out of our schools
[24:08] well don't let it take prayer out of
[24:09] your home
[24:10] it amazes me how many people i wish we
[24:12] had prayer in school you wanted to pray
[24:14] in your own house
[24:16] you wanted to sit down and pray with
[24:17] your kids you want the schools to do it
[24:20] for you that's what it is we want
[24:22] society to make it convenient for us to
[24:25] be christians that's not biblical
[24:28] everybody's a christian in that kind of
[24:30] condition that doesn't mean anything
[24:33] everybody has brother-in-law while we're
[24:35] on the same team and our team scores and
[24:37] praise god
[24:39] everybody can do that
[24:43] you used to amuse me when i was a kid i
[24:44] guess i'm on football now i'll use the
[24:46] nfl
[24:47] you know i remember when i was a kid and
[24:49] the packers were going to the super bowl
[24:50] my dad was a packers fan i didn't know
[24:52] he liked the packers
[24:54] he did that here
[24:56] everybody rallies around the champion oh
[24:58] yeah we're so great
[25:02] oh listen when we had we used to have
[25:04] the fire of god in this country we had
[25:06] to zoom the street and charles finney's
[25:08] and they're all gone
[25:09] can you can you serve god now
[25:14] when there's no no no government to prop
[25:16] you up i don't need the government
[25:19] listen i you i've been to countries and
[25:21] i've been near cut listen there are
[25:23] there are places in this world they will
[25:24] kill you
[25:25] for believing this bible there's places
[25:27] in this world that will put you in jail
[25:29] for even having a message book in your
[25:30] home
[25:31] and we act like we got so tough because
[25:34] they won't put our our favorite thing on
[25:36] tv or something
[25:38] i don't know why i'm going here all of a
[25:39] sudden
[25:41] we get so offended so easily
[25:44] by everything well listen these people
[25:45] are a bunch of sinners
[25:47] yeah that's what they had back there too
[25:50] i listen i understand this is the most
[25:51] deceitful wicked ages ever i totally get
[25:54] that but it's another thing when we sit
[25:55] here and we we nurture this idea that
[25:57] somehow we have to get everybody to see
[25:59] everything the way we want and then
[26:01] we'll serve god well if the pastor does
[26:03] it the way i want and if the church does
[26:05] it the way i want they preach it the way
[26:06] i want they sing the songs i want
[26:08] listen if that's all the deeper your
[26:10] commitment is to your family or your
[26:12] church or god you've got the wrong kind
[26:14] of commitment
[26:16] i'm not saying there's not issues to
[26:17] disagree about that you have to separate
[26:19] i'm not saying that but i'm saying we
[26:21] make mole hills in the mountains many
[26:23] times
[26:24] and we tend to make people well they're
[26:26] not as spiritual because they disagree
[26:27] with me
[26:30] well if you're really spiritual you'll
[26:31] love them anyway
[26:32] because when you're in the front yard i
[26:34] don't care how much you punch that guy
[26:36] in the face in the backyard
[26:38] hopefully you were hitting them more
[26:39] than you got hit
[26:40] as soon as you're in the front yard they
[26:42] come against one of you that come
[26:43] against all of us you want to touch my
[26:45] brother you want to come against my
[26:47] sister you have to go through me first
[26:55] i'm going to try to get back to my text
[26:56] here brother brown says in discernment
[26:58] of spirit again he says now they're
[26:59] talking about gifts again because i want
[27:01] to tie this into this idea of the
[27:02] supernatural as well but he says there's
[27:04] so much in the day we live and pertain
[27:05] to gifts so many people judge people by
[27:08] gifts that they have and they do it in
[27:10] churches oh listen he preaches this way
[27:12] and this guy's got this kind of gift and
[27:13] he's this kind of singer
[27:15] that's not good and fine but what's his
[27:17] attitude behind it
[27:19] there's plenty of listen balaam was
[27:20] gifted
[27:22] but he tried to destroy israel he tried
[27:24] to speak against it and god wouldn't
[27:27] even permit him
[27:28] and yet we think god's gonna let us
[27:29] speak against the bride
[27:32] even balaam knew better than that
[27:36] he says well i believe these things are
[27:37] gifts i believe what we see take place
[27:39] is gifts and they are god given gifts
[27:42] but we if we do not use them in the
[27:44] right way that god intended them to be
[27:46] used we can do more harm with the gifts
[27:49] than we could if we did not have the
[27:52] gifts
[27:53] so a gifted man with the wrong attitude
[27:55] is more dangerous than a man that has
[27:58] the
[27:59] wrong attitude and doesn't have a gift
[28:01] and we lift up the gift many times look
[28:03] he's and he's saying watch the spirit
[28:05] behind it because that'll do more damage
[28:10] the other night i made a statement the
[28:11] pope is saying this i would rather see
[28:12] brother brotherly love
[28:15] amen brotherly love existing among the
[28:17] church if we didn't have one case of
[28:20] healing or anything else
[28:23] now listen i believe in divine healing i
[28:25] preached about him i've seen it all the
[28:26] time but brother man is making the he's
[28:28] not he's not saying to throw out divine
[28:29] healing he said if i had to pick one
[28:32] if i had to only see one thing i'd
[28:34] rather see brotherly love among the
[28:36] churches if i didn't see one person
[28:38] healed
[28:39] we get worried when we pray for this
[28:40] person they don't get and you should be
[28:42] don't get me wrong we we should believe
[28:44] for healing we should see that but we'll
[28:46] get very concerned about that case and
[28:48] and we should but we'll neglect a lack
[28:51] of love among one another we're like ah
[28:52] that's just how it always is we've
[28:54] always been that way we just always
[28:55] fight that should concern us even more
[29:01] you know
[29:02] as a minister sometimes you run into
[29:05] the other ministers and stuff and you
[29:07] know they're both and i went over here
[29:08] and i preached i just raped these people
[29:10] over the coals and i just showed them
[29:11] this and i got on further this and then
[29:13] i'm like
[29:14] well i i don't enjoy doing that
[29:17] listen brother enjoy doing that
[29:20] listen brother brown you know if you
[29:21] want to hear a hard preacher brother
[29:23] brandon just turn on tape you know
[29:24] you're getting you hear somebody preach
[29:26] like man that preacher is just a hard
[29:27] preacher i'm thinking do they listen to
[29:29] the same tapes i listen to man that
[29:31] private he just he just tears them up
[29:33] but
[29:34] but he never enjoyed doing that he
[29:36] wasn't doing it because he disliked him
[29:39] see the difference he didn't get up
[29:40] there to vent on them his opinion
[29:42] because he was trying to stick it to him
[29:45] amen he got there because he loved them
[29:47] people didn't want to know what the
[29:48] scripture said
[29:50] so say it's the attitude behind it
[29:53] whatever kind of a gift or whatever we
[29:55] have in our life it's the attitude
[29:56] behind it that's important
[29:59] amen
[30:01] paul talks about this with the
[30:02] corinthian church i won't i won't read
[30:03] it all here for the sake of time but you
[30:05] know paul with the corinthian church
[30:06] he's dealing with this man that was
[30:07] caught in sin and he writes to him in
[30:09] second corinthians it says if i make you
[30:11] sorry he says who is it that makes me
[30:13] glad but the same that i made sorry in
[30:15] other words like if if you were all my
[30:18] joy why would i want to make you sorry
[30:21] that's what paul's saying why would you
[30:23] enjoy tormenting people that love you
[30:26] and that's his whole point i wouldn't i
[30:28] wouldn't want to do that and he said out
[30:30] of much affliction and anguish of heart
[30:32] i wrote on you with many tears not that
[30:35] you should be grieved but that you might
[30:38] know the love
[30:40] paul wasn't saying and doing these
[30:41] things because he he wanted to teach him
[30:43] a lesson and let him know that they were
[30:45] dumb and they weren't spiritual enough
[30:47] he said i didn't do it that you'd be
[30:49] greeted so you would know the love that
[30:51] i have more abundantly
[30:52] for you
[30:54] brother braham says now there's some
[30:55] members go to your church he says i know
[30:57] i'm talking to protestant and catholic
[31:00] i'm talking to calvius and armenia but
[31:01] that's neither pro nor khan you do this
[31:04] he says he says if you want to be a real
[31:07] outstanding person in your church how
[31:09] many wants to be an outstanding person
[31:10] in their church some of us are already
[31:12] outstanding
[31:14] hopefully you don't feel too
[31:15] anyway who wants to be an outstanding
[31:17] person i think we all want to amen if
[31:19] you want to be a outstanding person in
[31:20] your church whatever church you go he
[31:23] says he go you go to he says you just
[31:25] fall in love with god with all your
[31:28] heart
[31:30] and when you do that so i love god with
[31:32] all my heart when you do that you will
[31:35] fall in love with every member of your
[31:37] church
[31:39] and every member of everybody else's
[31:41] church
[31:42] with all your heart
[31:47] this is where we get spiritual say well
[31:48] i'll just convince everybody oh well
[31:50] he's got that covered next next sentence
[31:52] he says now
[31:53] you can't bluff that
[31:56] actually i found out you can to some
[31:59] yeah people
[31:59] i guess it's interesting
[32:01] i'm all i'm kind of all over the place
[32:02] here but it's interesting to me because
[32:04] you know people in the world if i could
[32:07] say it that way they seem to pick it
[32:09] they because they're a lot less willing
[32:11] to give you the benefit of the doubt
[32:13] they pick it up a lot faster if you're
[32:15] being insincere oh listen you know i
[32:18] love you and that's why i feel the need
[32:20] to make you be more like me people in
[32:22] the world don't buy that at all
[32:24] hey man they're just like you're just a
[32:25] pretentious religious person but they
[32:28] see someone that really loves them and
[32:29] they know it now a lot of times we just
[32:31] well you know that person i'm not saying
[32:33] we shouldn't give people the benefit of
[32:34] the doubt amen but the prophet's making
[32:36] the point you can't bluff that you might
[32:38] bluff it to some people people are going
[32:40] to find out what you're really about
[32:41] after a while
[32:42] you can't bluff that so don't try is
[32:45] this whole point
[32:46] you can't bluff that there's something
[32:48] about that people know
[32:50] he said if there's anything think about
[32:52] this is marvelous if you catch nothing
[32:54] else catch this today
[32:56] if there's anything i can contribute the
[32:58] success of my meetings to earthly
[33:01] speaking
[33:02] it is to know that people have a
[33:04] conscience to know that i truly love
[33:06] people
[33:08] now we talk about the spiritual element
[33:09] but he's talking about earthly speaking
[33:11] if i could contribute the success of my
[33:13] meetings anything people know that i
[33:15] really love people
[33:17] amen
[33:19] and they know that and you could he says
[33:20] you can't fool them on that
[33:23] if you're making your pretendings it's
[33:25] just like christianity if you're
[33:26] pertaining to being christian or just
[33:29] pretending rather to be a christian you
[33:31] will never make a go of it no sir it's
[33:33] absolutely got to be there that's all
[33:36] love will do it amen
[33:39] you know the bible is are you all are
[33:42] you all feeling good today well
[33:43] hopefully you love me at least
[33:45] maybe even love one another
[33:47] maybe even well praise the lord
[33:49] you know the bible says blessed are the
[33:51] peacemakers
[33:53] for they shall be called the children
[33:55] not the war makers
[33:57] the peacemakers shall be called the
[33:59] children of god why because as it said a
[34:01] few moments ago making peace is hard
[34:03] amen listen it's very
[34:06] it's it's i you know i i really respect
[34:09] uh you know nurses and doctors and
[34:12] things it's very easy for us to die
[34:14] physically it's very easy to hurt
[34:16] somebody it's it's really not that hard
[34:17] to hurt somebody it's really something
[34:19] when you can bind up somebody or help
[34:21] somebody a great man can lift somebody
[34:24] else up that's that's real power amen
[34:27] listen everybody can make war that you
[34:29] know of course you all probably heard me
[34:31] talk about how you know i read the art
[34:32] of war i read sun since the art of war
[34:33] and all this that's but listen i'm so
[34:35] thankful for the art of peace
[34:37] i'm so thankful there's a peace that god
[34:39] can give to your heart i'm thankful that
[34:41] god can teach you to make peace god can
[34:43] make you to sit down with your enemies
[34:47] that's real power amen
[34:50] making peace is hard listen like i said
[34:52] if you've ever been married if you've
[34:54] ever gone to church once i don't think
[34:55] it's somebody's first is this anybody's
[34:56] first time
[34:58] have you ever gone to church at all if
[34:59] you've ever been married if you've ever
[35:01] been in any relationship at all in your
[35:03] life amen you know that it's it's work
[35:06] sometimes sometimes it's not even always
[35:08] possible
[35:10] romans 12 says this in verse 18 the
[35:12] bible says if it be possible
[35:15] as much as life within you live
[35:17] peaceably with all men so it's not
[35:19] always possible
[35:21] but to the extent that it is as much as
[35:23] lies in you
[35:25] not the other person well listen if they
[35:28] just be a little more accommodating well
[35:30] you could be a little more accommodating
[35:32] maybe
[35:33] what as much so obviously there's
[35:35] different degrees some of us are able to
[35:38] be more peaceful than others i guess at
[35:40] least that's been my my witness in life
[35:43] some people but whatever the extent of
[35:46] that is that lies in you as much as lies
[35:47] within you live peaceably with all men
[35:51] amen
[35:52] so we have to make like i said an effort
[35:54] paul says again in hebrews 13 9 he says
[35:57] be not carried about with divers in
[35:59] strange doctrines for it is a good thing
[36:01] that the heart be established with grace
[36:03] not with meats which have not profited
[36:06] them that have been occupied therein so
[36:08] this ties into what peter talks about in
[36:10] acts chapter 15 verse 10 they're taught
[36:13] about the different doctrines because
[36:14] the church they had a dissension there
[36:16] again they were fighting over what do
[36:18] you need to be circumcised do we need to
[36:20] follow the law of moses and peter makes
[36:22] this point he says now therefore why
[36:24] tempt you god to put a yoke upon the
[36:27] neck of the disciples which neither our
[36:29] fathers nor we are able to bear
[36:33] thank god for a man like peter could
[36:35] have an honest moment like that
[36:37] you know why are we going to make a
[36:38] bunch of rules divers and strange
[36:39] doctors why are we gonna make this so
[36:41] much harder when we can't even do what
[36:43] we're telling other people to do
[36:45] there's something about a legalist
[36:47] especially amen they've got every kind
[36:48] of rule for you well listen the church
[36:50] doors have to be this and the picture
[36:52] the prophet has to be hanging in your
[36:53] church at such such a high this has to
[36:56] be this way and you can't have this
[36:57] color carpet and you can't
[37:00] they've got all these rules for how
[37:03] you've got to come into the kingdom
[37:05] and peter's making the point listen we
[37:07] couldn't do it anyway
[37:09] why are we going to project onto others
[37:12] rules that we can't keep
[37:16] well maybe i can keep it well your
[37:17] fathers couldn't do it listen if they
[37:19] couldn't if they couldn't do it if we
[37:21] can't do it why would we expect somebody
[37:24] else to
[37:28] see a lot of our a lot of our our
[37:30] variances come from rules that we
[37:33] thought that god gave us but it was
[37:34] really our opinion
[37:36] and we try to impose on everybody else
[37:39] when they don't want it imposed upon
[37:40] them
[37:41] well this is the fourth of july praise
[37:44] the lord coming up listen to the british
[37:45] government they want to impose all kinds
[37:47] of things and it caused what it caused
[37:50] of war it caused animosity
[37:53] because what they were imposing was too
[37:55] great a burden on these colonists listen
[37:58] sometimes we're that one
[38:00] we put rules on everybody else we can
[38:01] talk about everybody else how they did
[38:03] this to me i want to talk about us for a
[38:04] moment
[38:05] sometimes we have expectations well
[38:07] listen my my pastor needs to pray eight
[38:10] hours a day
[38:12] do you prayed hours a day well listen
[38:14] so-and-so they never call me
[38:17] when's the last time you called them
[38:20] well listen i was sick and and and
[38:22] nobody ever come and talk to me did you
[38:24] let them know you were sick well no
[38:28] they had they need you know if they were
[38:30] inspired if god inspired them they'd had
[38:33] a vision oh is that how you do it
[38:38] we've got all these expectations well
[38:40] listen nobody listen the bible said if
[38:42] you're secure call for the elders at
[38:44] least let them know
[38:47] praise the lord well listen these people
[38:49] they they didn't talk
[38:51] this person talked to me at church i had
[38:53] a brother one time listen i i stood by
[38:55] this person they never once said
[38:57] anything to me
[38:59] did you say anything to them well no
[39:02] might have been a good place to start a
[39:03] conversation
[39:05] little hello there how you doing god
[39:07] bless your brother you don't know their
[39:09] name you know i love that when i first
[39:10] started coming to church i didn't know
[39:12] anybody praise god didn't matter god
[39:14] bless you
[39:15] sister
[39:17] how you doing brother man you don't have
[39:19] to know my names
[39:22] listen we got all the barriers out of
[39:24] the way you can love everybody
[39:28] you don't have to know him for 40 years
[39:30] we we are brothers and listen we come
[39:33] from the same daddy that makes us
[39:35] siblings
[39:36] you've got brothers and sisters you
[39:38] might never met him in this life you'll
[39:39] meet him one day because you got the
[39:41] same daddy your family are all the same
[39:45] we put rules on people
[39:48] put rules a lot of times in a marriage
[39:51] listen my spouse they need to do this
[39:53] and you do that well what are you doing
[39:54] well nothing
[39:57] maybe you make a better attempt to get
[39:59] along with me
[40:01] clearly
[40:03] i see where the contention's coming from
[40:06] amen
[40:08] we make up rules that we can't even keep
[40:11] many times and listen and that's what
[40:13] paul talks about even when paul preaches
[40:15] about marriage and divorce he says you
[40:16] know it's a good thing he says if you
[40:18] can be unmarried like me
[40:20] but not everybody can do that listen not
[40:22] everybody has to be like me he's saying
[40:26] listen why aren't more people like me
[40:28] probably because we like to get along
[40:29] with one another
[40:31] because we all acted the same we'd
[40:32] probably not get along even worse
[40:35] i thank god i don't know anybody that's
[40:37] like me
[40:38] praise god
[40:40] one was enough
[40:43] well you all laugh but i won't be
[40:45] laughing i go home tonight like why me
[40:47] hi me lord
[40:49] you've all been there too i guess
[40:52] amen paul's you know listen i think it's
[40:55] good if you can live my like this but
[40:58] i'm not going to make that a commandment
[41:01] i'm not going to impose that because not
[41:04] everybody is like me in other words this
[41:06] is a this is a situation where you don't
[41:08] have to be just like this person
[41:11] there are certain things in the bible
[41:12] that we are to conform to and then
[41:14] there's certain things in the bible it's
[41:15] up to you
[41:18] well listen listen
[41:19] we're all looking for this ah we need to
[41:21] all be in the same no there's things
[41:22] that you're allowed to do it maybe
[41:24] somebody else isn't
[41:26] oh man
[41:28] oh man people they get all cringe about
[41:30] that oh man wow you sure about listen
[41:32] paul talks about with your meat and your
[41:34] drink all these now i'm not saying for
[41:36] well i'm gonna go have three wives who
[41:37] don't condemn me that's not what i'm
[41:38] talking about
[41:40] it's not what i'm talking about
[41:42] but listen he makes the point listen if
[41:43] you're if your me defends your brother
[41:45] don't eat it in front of him
[41:47] you're not going away well listen i can
[41:48] do what i want i love bacon no no no no
[41:51] no by the way i do love bacon
[41:54] but if i knew it offended you i would he
[41:56] said i won't eat meat
[41:58] till the world ends
[42:00] well praise the lord i i got convicted
[42:03] because uh my wife's one sister she's
[42:05] she's a vegetarian she turned vegetarian
[42:07] or vegan she's one
[42:09] appraisal i better stop
[42:14] later in her life she decided to
[42:16] to do this
[42:17] so of course me being a red-blooded male
[42:19] american i
[42:22] i decided that i would make it a point
[42:24] to
[42:25] eat lots of meat in front of her
[42:28] but i but what i'm saying is it's
[42:30] actually the wrong attitude now and i
[42:31] understand that there's more of a
[42:33] spiritual thing behind it but the point
[42:35] is listen if it bothers him don't do it
[42:37] we're so busy trying to make sure we
[42:39] offend it listen i'm gonna let everybody
[42:40] know where i stand well you you confess
[42:43] christ before man that's true
[42:45] but you don't have to listen i i had a
[42:47] triple whopper today
[42:49] i'm more spiritual than you i'm the
[42:51] bible says i'm strong in faith because i
[42:53] eat all things well the bible says don't
[42:55] let your meat destroy your brother if
[42:57] he's waking faith that doesn't mean you
[42:58] go up to him and say well listen brother
[43:00] i understand you're weaker in faith than
[43:02] me
[43:04] so i'm not going to do this it's not
[43:05] that point
[43:07] the point is to not let him be condemned
[43:09] because of your attitude in the first
[43:11] place
[43:12] so you might try to find all these
[43:13] work-arounds see your attitudes are only
[43:15] looking for a workaround
[43:17] well how can i how can i condemn this
[43:18] person without condemning them why are
[43:20] you trying to condemn him at all
[43:23] that's peter's whole point listen why
[43:25] are we gonna put rules on to stop him
[43:26] from coming in when we want him to come
[43:28] in
[43:32] so sometimes we impose our own rules
[43:34] i'll give you an example
[43:36] let's pick on me hour praise the lord
[43:38] you're all safe today march safe from
[43:41] condemnation
[43:43] well listen when i was a young man i i
[43:45] got saved at 24 come the church i was
[43:48] married
[43:49] married at 24 as well i believe no i was
[43:51] 25 by then yes
[43:53] so i started preaching a couple years
[43:54] later and i'll just be real honest uh
[43:57] i've never i've never adamantly been
[43:58] against doctors i've had bad experiences
[44:00] in my life and things and so you know
[44:02] it's like anything else there's good
[44:03] doctors there's bad doctors they're good
[44:05] there's good lawyers there's bad lords
[44:06] it's all the same but as a young man i i
[44:09] maybe leaned a little bit against
[44:12] doctors i'm like listen if this person
[44:14] really had faith
[44:16] they wouldn't need to see a doctor
[44:17] they'd be healthy like me
[44:20] listen that's easy to say when you're a
[44:21] 20 some year old man
[44:27] well listen i've invented this rule
[44:29] because i'm able to live this way well i
[44:31] was till i got sick
[44:33] guess what happened you know you see
[44:34] people like well i'll never go to the
[44:36] doctor i've got faith they feel that way
[44:38] till they get sick and then guess what
[44:40] happens
[44:41] they get more spiritual all of a sudden
[44:43] oh god has led me
[44:46] to seek out a physician well praise god
[44:49] you're the first person in history that
[44:51] god's ever wanted to have somebody go
[44:52] see a doctor all these other people were
[44:54] just backsliding but you you've got
[44:56] faith
[45:00] it's true
[45:01] you begin to reevaluate after what well
[45:03] you know maybe
[45:04] maybe that was my idea no i praise god i
[45:08] i try never like lean that way preaching
[45:10] whatever but i yeah it's hard to say
[45:12] what comes out i mean there's so much
[45:13] this is god let's be honest sometimes
[45:15] the man comes
[45:16] out hopefully not too much the less the
[45:19] better but listen i i would never want
[45:22] to this is my point i would never want
[45:23] to take somebody that goes to the doctor
[45:25] and condemn him for that
[45:27] that's not how the prophet preached it
[45:28] that's not what the bible says but
[45:30] there's people that have done that and
[45:31] even in message churches
[45:33] well listen if they had faith they
[45:35] wouldn't have to go to the doctor maybe
[45:36] they have faith that's why they're going
[45:40] amen
[45:41] now doctor you know i do like i read
[45:43] this quote this this is kind of a segue
[45:45] here
[45:46] i'll read this brother man talks about
[45:48] this in 1953 elijah he says look at
[45:50] diseases breaking out when doctors don't
[45:52] even know what they are here we are
[45:56] my kids just my kids went in the the
[45:58] breakfast area the hotel this morning
[46:00] like oh there's something about monkey
[46:01] pox on there like a crate
[46:04] there's hippo pox and monkey pogs and lf
[46:07] i can't even keep track anymore
[46:10] this coven 19. we've never seen anything
[46:12] like it oh that's reassuring
[46:15] listen we've we just come to this new
[46:17] thing but we don't know you know it's
[46:18] gonna make you lose your smell
[46:20] you're gonna lose your memory yeah all
[46:22] these people have all these different
[46:23] reactions to it they don't know listen i
[46:25] believe they're trying i get that but
[46:27] they really don't know what they're
[46:28] dealing with
[46:29] if there's ever a time you want to be
[46:31] certain of god it's now
[46:33] amen
[46:35] he says we're developing drugs and i
[46:37] look i preach divine healing i'm not
[46:39] against drugs you realize that no sir
[46:41] they're god-given but today they've
[46:43] become he says
[46:45] i don't know what to call it
[46:46] he says well we're here not long ago i
[46:48] was saying tells you a story
[46:50] not long ago i was writing on the road i
[46:52] i picked up an agent we were talking
[46:53] together in a filling station he come
[46:55] talking about divine healing he said the
[46:57] medical racket has become the greatest
[46:59] in the nation
[47:01] they kill as many as they help they give
[47:03] a penicillin shot it'll help you get rid
[47:05] of a bad cold it'll set you up something
[47:07] else that might take your life
[47:09] now they've gotten this thing well you
[47:10] know you've got this slight chance of a
[47:12] heart condition you took this this
[47:14] vaccine but you know it your survival
[47:16] rate's really high i'm like oh you mean
[47:18] like it was with kovid
[47:21] so
[47:22] now i'm not against her for it but i'm
[47:24] just making the point he's he says this
[47:25] here he says i come back from overseas
[47:27] dr dare my friend in jeffersonville he
[47:29] said billy i don't want to give you
[47:30] penicillin i've got you some
[47:32] chloromycetin
[47:33] well i was up there praying for the sick
[47:34] and everything i was just sneezing
[47:36] around
[47:37] my wife said well you come in a hot
[47:39] climate take some medicine so his wife
[47:40] said get some medicine
[47:42] i took them things and didn't do me no
[47:44] good
[47:46] i went and got another bottle and took
[47:48] them i got so swimmy headed sometimes
[47:50] sometimes the remedy is worse than the
[47:52] cure or the the i'm sorry the remedy is
[47:54] worse than the the malady the situation
[47:57] my wife's just doing that so they're
[47:58] going with these allergy shots and she's
[48:00] worse than ever it's like well praise
[48:02] the lord
[48:04] i couldn't stand up i called the doctor
[48:05] said doc you know them things when
[48:07] you're swimming headed he said how many
[48:08] you took i said two bottles
[48:10] he said mercy goodness enough to kill
[48:12] you
[48:14] quit taking them
[48:17] now the doctor expected you to tell him
[48:19] before you took the second bottle
[48:21] what did the doctor tell me this had
[48:23] side effects
[48:24] because he expected you to call when he
[48:26] had side effects
[48:27] he didn't expect you to take another
[48:28] bottle almost kill yourself
[48:32] brother bam says there's only one thing
[48:33] about a bad cold
[48:35] if you take the medicine you have it
[48:36] seven days
[48:37] if you leave it alone you have it for
[48:38] one week
[48:44] now i read all this to make this point
[48:46] the very next sentence is so you can
[48:47] suit yourself now that's it so i use
[48:50] that example because of myself i've seen
[48:52] i've seen a lot of the racket you know
[48:54] when they're coming out and telling you
[48:55] where you need your fifth vaccine now
[48:56] the ceo of this mega corporation that
[48:59] sells pharmaceuticals saying well we
[49:00] need your fifth vaccine now i'm thinking
[49:02] to myself well he's not motivated at all
[49:06] he's not motivated by any sort of
[49:08] monetary incentive at all
[49:11] but at the same time i'm thankful that
[49:12] they are because of the people that need
[49:14] him
[49:15] now that's why i'm saying this you're
[49:16] looking even message churches
[49:19] i'm bringing this full circle now
[49:21] you know we look at this covert thing
[49:22] certain churches react one way and
[49:24] certain churches react another way
[49:26] people some people get a vaccine and
[49:27] some people don't and we're sitting here
[49:30] supposed to be the enlightened bride of
[49:32] jesus christ and we're such medical
[49:34] experts not only for our own condition
[49:36] but everybody else is to let them know
[49:38] listen brother if you're a christian you
[49:40] wouldn't take that or listen brother if
[49:42] you're a christian you would take that
[49:43] listen suit yourself
[49:45] because what works for you might not
[49:47] work for somebody else
[49:49] listen even biologically we're different
[49:52] listen i am not a medical doctor
[49:54] i thank god for him amen but listen i'm
[49:56] not one if you feel that you need to
[49:58] take a certain thing or do it if god let
[50:00] you do it why would i condemn you for
[50:02] that
[50:04] and if you don't feel that way listen
[50:06] our church we're gonna do listen you do
[50:08] what you need to do and don't condemn
[50:10] the other person for doing it
[50:13] it's become such a variance you've got
[50:15] message preachers and i'm not preaching
[50:16] against either one because this is my
[50:17] whole point you got one church they
[50:19] preach it one way and they tell this
[50:20] church over here they're carnal and the
[50:21] other one gets up well listen they're a
[50:23] bunch of backsliders i'm thinking let
[50:25] brotherly love continue
[50:27] where where's the brotherly love
[50:30] you know what if this church starts
[50:32] it amazes me well listen their church
[50:34] starts at 10 30 and we start at 10 i'm
[50:37] not saying this church because you start
[50:38] at 10 but they start at noon and listen
[50:40] they're right listen if i don't go to
[50:42] that church why do i care when they
[50:44] start
[50:46] we've got so spiritual now to where we
[50:49] know how to run everybody else's church
[50:51] and our own
[50:53] can't run our own house we can't run our
[50:55] own lives but we're on everybody else's
[50:57] business
[51:00] i just don't know why nobody agrees with
[51:01] me all the time they just want to fight
[51:02] with me
[51:06] i don't know it's astounding
[51:09] i just don't get it
[51:11] you know what now praise the lord now
[51:14] you may know somebody like this in your
[51:16] life
[51:18] it doesn't matter what you do
[51:21] you're wrong
[51:23] you'll pull
[51:25] you pull out of the driveway you turn
[51:27] one way well you should have went that
[51:28] way
[51:31] pull on the drive with the next one you
[51:32] turn this way you should have went that
[51:33] way
[51:35] i forgot it was a full moon on the third
[51:37] wednesday of the month so
[51:44] now we can condemn this person for being
[51:46] contentious
[51:48] or you could use a soft answer and turn
[51:50] away wrath you can turn the other cheek
[51:52] the whole point is not saying well look
[51:54] at this person see because you preach
[51:56] this and people say well i know somebody
[51:57] like that well the point is are you the
[51:59] somebody
[52:01] not the somebody this is not let's call
[52:03] out that guy
[52:05] i've been waiting for this day wow we're
[52:07] gonna drag him out in the parking lot
[52:08] brother he was talking about you
[52:11] pitchfork religion
[52:13] brother this is all for you sister
[52:15] sister you better straight up what are
[52:18] you doing to live peaceably
[52:25] david said the 131st psalm i love this
[52:28] david says lord my heart
[52:30] is not haughty nor mine eyes lofty
[52:34] neither do i exercise myself in great
[52:36] matters
[52:37] or in things too high for me
[52:39] he says surely i behaved and quieted
[52:42] myself as a child that is weaned of his
[52:44] mother my soul is even as a wayne mother
[52:47] i'm sorry weaned child let me read the
[52:49] first verse in psalm 131 verse 1 lord my
[52:51] heart is not haughty nor my eyes lofty
[52:54] neither do i exercise myself in great
[52:56] matters or things too high for me this
[53:00] is a king
[53:03] once you understand this is not a guy
[53:05] that's uh he's working at a restaurant
[53:07] he's a factory worker he's a he's a
[53:09] homemaker this is the king of an entire
[53:12] nation
[53:13] he's like lord my heart's not haughty i
[53:16] don't exercise that myself it matters
[53:18] too great for me what's too great for
[53:20] the king
[53:21] even a king you're saying lord if it's
[53:23] not my business if it's beyond my scope
[53:27] lord i'm not gonna mess with it i'm not
[53:29] gonna exercise myself in it if king
[53:32] david could have that kind of discretion
[53:34] why do we think we need to quarterback
[53:35] everybody's lives for them
[53:37] listen this is the play we're gonna run
[53:39] here
[53:40] i didn't know we were running a play
[53:45] okay well thanks
[53:48] i'm laughing because i know where i'm
[53:50] going with this
[53:52] i've got i've got some brothers that
[53:54] they've planned my ministry out for me
[53:58] you probably know
[54:00] some people that they know where your
[54:02] life is going for you and they let you
[54:03] know
[54:04] and he told me one time well listen i
[54:06] believe the lord called you to go to
[54:07] such place okay brother well i
[54:08] appreciate that
[54:10] lord talks to me too i'll i'll take it
[54:12] up with him he come back a couple months
[54:14] later
[54:15] brother i believe the lord wants you to
[54:16] be at this in such a place i'm thinking
[54:20] i have not yet mastered the ability to
[54:22] be in two places at once i i don't know
[54:24] how i'm going to fulfill your will in my
[54:26] life sir
[54:26] [Laughter]
[54:29] surely the lord would grant me the
[54:30] ability to do this if he wants me to do
[54:31] it
[54:32] you know he's got all these lofty plans
[54:34] for me but listen david the
[54:36] leader of a nation said list and there
[54:38] are some things it's just too great for
[54:40] me and i leave it alone
[54:42] just leave it alone
[54:44] so in other words it's not my job i
[54:47] found this out
[54:48] hopefully not the hard way i found
[54:50] that's not my job to call up every
[54:51] message church
[54:52] see what time their service is and how
[54:54] they operate church order and let them
[54:56] know it's none of my business
[54:59] that church is sovereign this church is
[55:00] sovereign it's not your business
[55:03] now listen to those necessarily you have
[55:05] to like it or agree with that many times
[55:07] you don't have to go along listen like i
[55:09] said a lot of times it's just it's
[55:11] something doesn't even concern us
[55:14] listen these people they they do this in
[55:16] their home what is that concerning well
[55:17] no
[55:19] then why do you care
[55:21] listen i i just be real honest the older
[55:24] i get
[55:24] because i'm so old i feel like it felt
[55:27] like it this morning
[55:28] listen the older you get for me at least
[55:31] you see stuff it's either going to
[55:33] bother you more
[55:35] or you're going to learn just to have to
[55:36] relax a little bit
[55:38] amen
[55:40] you know you see people and i
[55:42] maybe you've never dealt with this maybe
[55:44] this is just me but you see people
[55:45] sometimes and they're doing something
[55:46] wrong and you know it's wrong and maybe
[55:47] it's actually even wrong
[55:50] and you're like man they're doing that
[55:52] wrong but you know what sometimes it
[55:53] just doesn't concern you
[55:55] i'm not saying if it's something sinful
[55:57] or whatever you shouldn't i'm talking
[55:58] about you know maybe they make a bad
[56:00] purchase or something oh they bought
[56:02] this swamp land in this undeveloped area
[56:04] well listen they're they're not gonna go
[56:05] to hell over that
[56:07] they might they might put themselves
[56:09] through a personal one of that because
[56:11] they
[56:11] put all their money in crypto and then
[56:13] it crashed 300 percent
[56:17] you know
[56:18] but sometimes it doesn't concern you
[56:19] listen i this this is just me now you
[56:21] could take or leave this sometimes i see
[56:24] people doing something and i think well
[56:25] i'm right and they're wrong just let
[56:26] them go i just let them go because you
[56:28] know what then i then i'm right and i
[56:30] can be like shy
[56:32] yeah i showed them
[56:34] no i didn't show them but
[56:36] if if that person's wrong and you're
[56:38] right listen jesus said that wisdom's
[56:40] justified over children if you're doing
[56:41] what you're supposed to do and you're
[56:42] right god will bless it you don't have
[56:44] to go and announce it to everybody is my
[56:46] point
[56:47] god will allow it to pan out over the
[56:50] listen david when he was in the
[56:51] wilderness looked like he didn't know
[56:52] what he was talking about when saul died
[56:55] he become king wisdom was justified over
[56:57] children that was absolutely the plan of
[56:59] god
[57:00] where you're at now is not where you're
[57:01] going to be
[57:03] listen god he casts down the that which
[57:05] results itself but he lifts up that
[57:08] where you at today where somebody else
[57:10] is at today you might see the wicked
[57:11] prospering like david and you might
[57:13] wonder why did the wicked prosper you
[57:15] don't have to put your hand to saul
[57:17] let god take care of it
[57:20] god will put you where he wants you to
[57:21] be and god will put that person where he
[57:23] wants them out you don't have to sit
[57:25] there and try to tell them
[57:29] there are certain things this is what i
[57:31] was getting at earlier there are certain
[57:33] things that are
[57:34] they're not salvation issues
[57:38] we might try to make it into that but
[57:39] it's not always the case paul talks
[57:41] about this in first gear first
[57:42] corinthians 3. i won't read the whole
[57:43] thing but paul talks about laying a
[57:45] foundation you can lay a foundation of
[57:47] gold and silver and precious stones
[57:50] or you can use wood or hair stubble
[57:52] every man's work is going to be tried
[57:55] whether you preach the gospel you heal
[57:57] the sick whatever it is you did your
[57:59] work is going to be tried what was your
[58:00] motive behind it why did you do the
[58:02] things that you did your work can be
[58:04] tried and somebody else's work is going
[58:06] to be tried your work if it's tried and
[58:08] it's not found wanting if it's gold or
[58:11] silver or precious stones you'll receive
[58:13] a reward for it the bible says
[58:16] but i really want to kill this if if
[58:18] your work is wood and hate and stubble
[58:20] and it's burnt up you did everything for
[58:22] the wrong motive you saw this person did
[58:24] the wrong thing whatever it is
[58:26] their work is destroyed but they
[58:28] themselves will still be saved
[58:33] so some people might be losing their
[58:34] reward
[58:36] but they're not still losing their
[58:37] salvation
[58:40] many times that's the thing we fight
[58:41] with people over well listen i i believe
[58:43] that the church should be this way
[58:48] many times we rob not only others of
[58:50] peace but our own selves because we make
[58:52] things overly important
[58:55] we fuss and we debate about things that
[58:57] don't need fuss and debate about
[59:00] so that's why i if you're around me for
[59:02] like the time i'm sitting with people
[59:03] and they'll they start bickering about
[59:04] something i'll just be like well let bro
[59:06] they love continue so you remind
[59:07] yourself of this verse you're in that
[59:09] situation you know what they're just
[59:10] brothers they're just carrying on like
[59:12] brothers that's fine just remind
[59:14] yourself you know what we're still
[59:15] brothers we're still sisters just let
[59:17] brotherly love continue that's just how
[59:18] they're just family it's okay as long as
[59:22] they can still love one another at the
[59:23] end of the day
[59:24] if they can bitterly disagree
[59:27] not just if they can bitterly disagree
[59:29] and still put their arm around one
[59:31] another if you can still do that at the
[59:32] end of the discussion that's all that
[59:34] god requires he's not asking you to
[59:35] convince everybody
[59:36] he don't ask you to always be right and
[59:39] convince everybody you're right listen
[59:40] if you disagree and you can still love
[59:42] them that's what god's concerned about
[59:44] that's what we ought to be concerned
[59:45] about
[59:46] as i often say we're more concerned in
[59:49] our lives about being right than we are
[59:51] about being righteous
[59:53] well we want to be right we want
[59:54] everybody know that we're right just
[59:55] love them anyhow
[59:57] maybe you are right maybe they are wrong
[59:59] but can you love them anyhow because you
[1:00:01] can be right about something and have
[1:00:02] the wrong attitude and that's worse
[1:00:06] it's worse
[1:00:09] amen
[1:00:13] you know i think uh
[1:00:16] i think that's one of the big things
[1:00:17] that's been a reproach
[1:00:19] around the message even
[1:00:20] you know we claim to be
[1:00:21] non-denominational and the message is
[1:00:23] non-denominational
[1:00:25] but the whole issue that paul deals with
[1:00:27] in first corinthians 3 was their
[1:00:29] divisions or their variances it wasn't
[1:00:31] about caiphus or paul or whatever it was
[1:00:33] about the fact that they were divided
[1:00:35] about it
[1:00:36] amen and message churches you know you
[1:00:39] look at brother brahm's own church when
[1:00:41] uh
[1:00:42] junior jackson leaves the church and he
[1:00:44] goes down the church he's got people in
[1:00:46] his church criticizing the people and he
[1:00:48] said don't you do that they believed
[1:00:49] this message just the same as me even
[1:00:51] though their order was different
[1:00:54] but the brand didn't model it that way
[1:00:55] well listen i'm the prophet of god they
[1:00:58] shouldn't listen to me that's not how he
[1:01:00] dealt with it in the church
[1:01:01] he said listen they're just as much my
[1:01:03] brothers they believe this message just
[1:01:05] as much as me they just differ on church
[1:01:06] order with gifts on the floor that's
[1:01:08] their troubles he said
[1:01:10] that's their troubles let them have
[1:01:12] their own troubles
[1:01:13] don't make it your trouble but it's not
[1:01:15] your trouble
[1:01:16] see we've got so much we lose so much
[1:01:18] peace worried about things
[1:01:21] it's not yours to worry about
[1:01:24] if it bothers you so much pray for that
[1:01:26] person
[1:01:27] can we pray for that person as much as
[1:01:29] we complain about him
[1:01:31] can we pray for that person as much as
[1:01:32] we rebuke him
[1:01:34] can we love him as much as we chide them
[1:01:38] amen
[1:01:39] but what i love about this paul he's
[1:01:42] he's he's blasting so to speak these
[1:01:44] corinthians for their divisions they're
[1:01:45] being carnal this is but you know what
[1:01:49] you're still god's children
[1:01:51] you're fighting and you're carnal and
[1:01:53] you're letting all this stuff go on but
[1:01:54] you know what you were all baptized into
[1:01:56] one spirit by one body we're all one
[1:01:57] body we're still christians
[1:02:00] god even a colonel you say that that
[1:02:01] christian they're the most carnal
[1:02:02] christian i know well as long as they're
[1:02:04] a christian that's fine
[1:02:06] amen because they can grow up too
[1:02:09] listen baby christians grow up you say
[1:02:11] well they just act like such a colonel
[1:02:12] person well praise god they've got room
[1:02:14] to grow
[1:02:16] let them go
[1:02:17] let god do something in their life
[1:02:20] if you want to be there and say
[1:02:22] something do it to be a help to them
[1:02:25] not to put them down and pull them up
[1:02:27] amen
[1:02:30] brother brahm says this
[1:02:32] probably uh it's 1958 the great
[1:02:34] commission he says if i have found grace
[1:02:36] in your sight through god you take my
[1:02:38] word for this brother if you want to be
[1:02:40] a blessing and get a blessing when a man
[1:02:42] has done you wrong i'm talking about
[1:02:44] your attitude now
[1:02:45] now talk about the other person when a
[1:02:47] man has done you wrong and he absolutely
[1:02:49] just i mean he's done you wrong and you
[1:02:52] know that he's done you wrong there's no
[1:02:54] question about it
[1:02:55] this is the bible it's in black and
[1:02:57] white he is this guy is absolutely wrong
[1:02:59] towards
[1:03:00] me okay what's the prophet say
[1:03:04] i mean he has done you wrong and you
[1:03:05] know he has done you wrong he's done you
[1:03:08] evil don't mention that you take him to
[1:03:10] prayer before god amen
[1:03:13] before you think well the preacher said
[1:03:14] i have to take to prayer before god well
[1:03:16] he covers that he says and don't take it
[1:03:18] away just self and say well i'm supposed
[1:03:21] to do this
[1:03:22] that's what we do well i guess i'll love
[1:03:24] you because i'm supposed to
[1:03:28] but stand with your shoulder to his
[1:03:30] shoulder and stand in the presence of
[1:03:32] god our father pray he says the way a
[1:03:35] prayer should be made in the presence of
[1:03:36] god say father here's my brother and he
[1:03:39] justly he deserves punishment he's dummy
[1:03:43] evil i don't see why he did it
[1:03:47] that's the problem we don't see the
[1:03:49] we don't see the other side of it well i
[1:03:51] don't know why this person acts this way
[1:03:52] well you don't know where they've been
[1:03:54] maybe they asked that way for a reason
[1:03:58] not justif listen i'm not justifying
[1:04:01] when people do the wrong thing but i'm
[1:04:02] saying maybe sometimes they do the wrong
[1:04:04] thing because something in their life
[1:04:05] made them feel that way
[1:04:07] this person's insecure or whatever maybe
[1:04:09] they come out of an abusive home and
[1:04:11] then they act a certain way well listen
[1:04:13] it's because they have a problem
[1:04:15] you want to make that worse
[1:04:17] or you want to help them
[1:04:19] brother braham says this continuing on
[1:04:21] here
[1:04:22] i don't see why he did it then let god
[1:04:24] go to talking to you
[1:04:26] and maybe you'll see maybe where that
[1:04:28] man's been through the devil has twisted
[1:04:30] him up somewhere and caused him to do
[1:04:32] that though he's absolutely wrong
[1:04:35] before you leave the throne of god
[1:04:37] you'll be feeling sorry for that man
[1:04:41] you'll be sympathizing with that brother
[1:04:44] when you get back down here to earth
[1:04:45] again you'll go to that brother and
[1:04:47] shake his hand because you know what
[1:04:49] he's been through
[1:04:52] see a lot of times you know what
[1:04:53] somebody's been through
[1:04:54] well this this brother
[1:04:56] well praise the lord
[1:04:58] this is another i guess maybe this is
[1:05:00] why i'm going this way but i was talking
[1:05:01] to i'll mention who i was talking
[1:05:03] brother henry van wyk here at the kids
[1:05:04] days last week we were talking about you
[1:05:06] know the situation you ever meet
[1:05:08] somebody and like the first time you
[1:05:10] mean they just can't stand you you're
[1:05:12] the devil and shoe leather and they just
[1:05:14] hate your guts you're thinking what did
[1:05:16] i do
[1:05:18] a lot of times when you look like
[1:05:19] somebody you remind them of something
[1:05:21] you're not that person but you remind
[1:05:24] them of somebody and because it's so bad
[1:05:26] that's why they treat you that way now
[1:05:28] if you knew that was why you'd feel
[1:05:30] sorry for them
[1:05:32] but when you don't know you said they're
[1:05:33] going well i didn't do anything to them
[1:05:34] they were just absolutely wrong there's
[1:05:35] no
[1:05:36] i'm a christian there's no reason for
[1:05:38] them to treat me that way and i didn't
[1:05:39] do it
[1:05:40] but when you realize what they've been
[1:05:42] through you say you know what
[1:05:44] i get it
[1:05:46] i get it
[1:05:48] nobody likes being reminded of those
[1:05:49] things i i didn't mean to do that
[1:05:51] sometimes you can't help it
[1:05:55] that's why as much as lies with
[1:05:56] sometimes it can't be helped
[1:05:59] but my goal is never to run them further
[1:06:00] away
[1:06:04] you'll go to feeling sorry he said
[1:06:07] sorry for that man you'll be
[1:06:08] sympathizing that brother when you get
[1:06:09] back down to here you go to that brother
[1:06:11] shake his hand because you know what
[1:06:12] he's been through you can't stand with a
[1:06:15] mortal in the presence of god and
[1:06:17] condemn anybody
[1:06:18] i don't believe no sir even if he's a
[1:06:20] rank sinner
[1:06:22] and what about a brother see brotherly
[1:06:24] kindness what about a brother that's
[1:06:26] made a mistake though i say he's wrong
[1:06:29] sometimes he's accused wrong when he's
[1:06:32] not wrong ever been there
[1:06:35] listen have you ever been accused or had
[1:06:37] a rumor told about you didn't like it
[1:06:38] well if you don't like it don't do it
[1:06:40] about somebody else
[1:06:44] sometimes he's accused wrong when he's
[1:06:45] not wrong but if he is wrong well we'll
[1:06:48] just take the throne of god
[1:06:50] stand there shoulder shoulder with our
[1:06:51] brother not think about the sound nor
[1:06:53] he's immortal and maybe his destination
[1:06:56] rests upon our attitude toward him
[1:07:00] when we come back from the throne of god
[1:07:02] we realize we're everyone guilty where
[1:07:04] everyone need help from one another this
[1:07:06] is what i was dealing with this this
[1:07:07] woman she must i don't know she was hurt
[1:07:09] somewhere in life by by a preacher or
[1:07:11] something she just had this
[1:07:13] you know i i said one thing to a guy and
[1:07:14] she took it i was attacking this guy and
[1:07:16] this that and the guy and i were totally
[1:07:18] on the same page we were just we're just
[1:07:20] kind of joking a little bit about
[1:07:21] something she totally took it the wrong
[1:07:23] way and like you know a pastor shouldn't
[1:07:24] be trying to preach or shouldn't i'm
[1:07:26] like i i don't know what i did to you
[1:07:29] but this brother he was so intent that
[1:07:31] she needed to apologize and make this
[1:07:33] right said don't do that that's just
[1:07:34] going to drive her further away because
[1:07:35] she feels justified i said brother i
[1:07:37] don't need her apology i forgive her
[1:07:39] it's fine
[1:07:41] see we're i need them to be
[1:07:44] sorry about i need them to tell me i was
[1:07:46] right
[1:07:47] you you put in that position all that if
[1:07:50] they're already defensive they're just
[1:07:51] going to build up a wall
[1:07:52] my my goal not to run her further off
[1:07:54] and say well i was right she's wrong my
[1:07:56] goal is you know what if there's any way
[1:07:59] that she would ever feel
[1:08:00] to come to somebody and ask about christ
[1:08:02] again i i would wonder i would never
[1:08:04] want to stand in the way of that
[1:08:06] i'm willing as paul said i'm willing to
[1:08:08] suffer
[1:08:09] suffer being wrong suffer the loss of
[1:08:11] all things
[1:08:12] what is your pride what is your
[1:08:14] reputation compared to the value of a
[1:08:16] soul is it not worth laying down
[1:08:19] oh i gotta be right i don't care if she
[1:08:21] thinks i'm the worst person in the world
[1:08:23] as long as she finds jesus
[1:08:25] she'll find out in the end who's who
[1:08:26] anyway i i don't care if that person
[1:08:29] thinks you're whatever
[1:08:31] just let them find jesus let them get
[1:08:33] the answer they need
[1:08:35] she doesn't mean me
[1:08:37] as a man
[1:08:40] amen
[1:08:41] maybe you might and that's why i said
[1:08:42] listen it's the wrong attitude i do i
[1:08:44] don't need i don't need validation
[1:08:47] i want to see somebody saved
[1:08:50] your attitude can affect their
[1:08:51] destination
[1:08:54] amen
[1:08:57] for the sake of time i'm going to move
[1:08:58] on here real quick but
[1:09:00] paul says in colossians chapter 2
[1:09:02] he says walk in wisdom toward them that
[1:09:04] are without
[1:09:05] redeeming the time let your speech
[1:09:06] always be with grace seasoned with salt
[1:09:09] that you may know how you ought to
[1:09:11] answer every man so you don't want to
[1:09:13] just say things you want to have the
[1:09:14] right kind of a seasoning you want to
[1:09:16] have the right kind of a savory wants to
[1:09:17] be salty now it's funny because salty
[1:09:19] today
[1:09:21] has a different connotation than salt he
[1:09:22] does in the bible now when somebody's
[1:09:23] salted it means they're upset they're
[1:09:25] crying they're tea you know they're
[1:09:26] salty we don't want to be that kind of
[1:09:28] salty christian we want to be the bible
[1:09:30] kind of salty we want the things that we
[1:09:33] say we don't just tell the truth we want
[1:09:34] to speak the truth in love amen
[1:09:37] i got a whole nother thing here and i i
[1:09:39] don't i don't really have time for it
[1:09:41] but you know i'll say this i'm a
[1:09:44] preacher that i don't believe in secret
[1:09:45] sensitive churches we're trying to make
[1:09:47] everybody happy and i've preached
[1:09:48] against it many times
[1:09:50] you know we're not to be men pleasers
[1:09:51] because that's what paul said in in
[1:09:53] galatians chapter 1 uh verse 10 we're
[1:09:55] not to seek to please men but you know
[1:09:57] the boss paul does also talk about
[1:09:59] trying to please your brother or
[1:10:00] whatever for for edification
[1:10:04] it's a greek word it's a rescue
[1:10:06] and it means to be agreeable or by
[1:10:09] implication to strive to be agreeable in
[1:10:12] other words as a christian you're
[1:10:13] actually trying to get along with people
[1:10:16] your goal is not to say well i was
[1:10:17] persecuted because i badmouthed
[1:10:18] everybody at church
[1:10:20] it's not persecution you're just
[1:10:21] unlikable
[1:10:23] [Laughter]
[1:10:25] your goal is not to run them off
[1:10:28] paul says in romans 15 we then who are
[1:10:30] strong oh i'm strong well okay this is
[1:10:32] what strong people do we them that are
[1:10:34] strong ought to bear the infirmities of
[1:10:36] the weak and not to please ourselves
[1:10:38] that everyone must please his neighbor
[1:10:41] for his good to edification not pleasing
[1:10:44] for political reasons not pleasing for
[1:10:46] your own gain please them for
[1:10:48] edification
[1:10:50] even christ please not himself but that
[1:10:53] is written the reproaches of them that
[1:10:55] approach thee fell on me
[1:10:58] you've got a better reproach to help
[1:10:59] somebody than do it that's what christ
[1:11:01] did for you
[1:11:05] first corinthians 10
[1:11:07] whether therefore you eat or drink or
[1:11:09] whatever you do all to the glory of god
[1:11:10] giving none offense
[1:11:12] neither the jews nor the greeks or the
[1:11:14] church of god he was like please a
[1:11:15] rescue i please all men in all things
[1:11:18] now he's not a people pleaser but he's
[1:11:21] trying to help somebody if he has to
[1:11:23] accommodate them in a not sinful way
[1:11:26] to accommodate them to get them to the
[1:11:28] gospel he's going to do it
[1:11:30] he's going to do all things for all men
[1:11:32] that by all means he might save some
[1:11:35] amen
[1:11:37] i please almond all things not seeking
[1:11:39] my own prophet but the prophet of many
[1:11:42] that they may be saved
[1:11:46] listen i use the example earlier paul
[1:11:48] talks about marriage he said if you are
[1:11:49] a married man uh you know the unmarried
[1:11:52] man he minds the things of god
[1:11:54] mary baby has to mind the things of the
[1:11:56] world how to please his wife
[1:11:58] now paul's not saying that's a bad thing
[1:12:00] listen if you make your wife happy
[1:12:02] that's a good thing
[1:12:04] and when it's married if you're white
[1:12:05] you know happy wife
[1:12:07] happy life
[1:12:09] it's not a bad thing
[1:12:10] hey man
[1:12:13] it's okay to get along with people
[1:12:17] oh brother loves corrective well it's
[1:12:19] not nitpicking you to death that's not
[1:12:21] what it is
[1:12:22] it's not only corrective amen it's also
[1:12:25] patient it's kind
[1:12:27] it envy it's not seeketh not her own
[1:12:30] love has a lot more to it than just wow
[1:12:32] you know we got to correct people all
[1:12:33] the time amen i use this example all the
[1:12:36] time you know we talk about
[1:12:38] listen jesus was a likable person
[1:12:41] the only people that didn't like jesus
[1:12:43] was other religious people
[1:12:46] amen listen common people heard him
[1:12:48] gladly he went well he's one of them
[1:12:51] fussy dog no the common people liked him
[1:12:55] they just got
[1:12:56] who incited them to kill jesus the
[1:12:58] religious people
[1:13:00] because they don't know what they're
[1:13:01] doing he said that they don't know what
[1:13:03] they're doing
[1:13:05] the leaders know what they're doing but
[1:13:06] these common people he actually died for
[1:13:09] them he loved him even under death
[1:13:12] and they loved him sort of
[1:13:14] they liked him amen
[1:13:18] praise the lord
[1:13:22] i'll read this quote here i i i want to
[1:13:24] tie this up this is a familiar quote if
[1:13:26] you've ever studied the message standing
[1:13:27] in the gap 63 brother talking about the
[1:13:29] complex he developed where he lost his
[1:13:31] feeling for the people
[1:13:32] because they rejected his message
[1:13:34] he says you see even the great saint
[1:13:36] paul
[1:13:36] got between straights one times and many
[1:13:38] times god has did things
[1:13:41] watch this or let his servants do things
[1:13:43] that was mistakes
[1:13:45] in order to prove these things
[1:13:47] now we know that human beings can make
[1:13:49] mistakes but god can make no mistake so
[1:13:52] sometimes god allow mistakes in people's
[1:13:54] life that we're sitting and we're just
[1:13:55] fussing and fighting why would god let
[1:13:56] him do that sometimes god allows it for
[1:13:59] his purpose
[1:14:04] he said now i get in the field of
[1:14:05] preaching i go the way i do i have to
[1:14:06] set up meetings ahead and things get
[1:14:08] lined up and perhaps this is that great
[1:14:10] time coming that we've been looking for
[1:14:12] and surely if this is itself is a
[1:14:14] tremendous thing it will bring to pass
[1:14:16] it may come to pass the tremendous
[1:14:18] victory in the love divine that's the
[1:14:19] verb before the adverb it's divine love
[1:14:21] which is god it takes the love of god to
[1:14:25] dash out there on the front line and
[1:14:27] stand in the gap for the people brother
[1:14:29] man says and these ricky's or a cat is
[1:14:31] that have so sassed the words i've
[1:14:33] called them no he's the one being sassy
[1:14:35] i've called them that ricky and raquetta
[1:14:37] god give me to understand i shouldn't do
[1:14:40] that because it's many of them that are
[1:14:42] still his children
[1:14:45] well listen this person is the worst
[1:14:46] sinner i know yeah but you don't know
[1:14:48] where they'll be in five years
[1:14:50] if the lord tarries you don't know where
[1:14:52] to be next week
[1:14:54] how many times and i don't want your
[1:14:55] mind to water too much but how many
[1:14:56] times do you see someone at church
[1:14:58] here's a here's a great so-and-so this
[1:15:00] is a great person oh here's and where
[1:15:02] are they at five years later
[1:15:05] we're not careful we're sitting here
[1:15:07] bad-mouthing this person oh they're just
[1:15:09] the lowest worst most carnal person in
[1:15:12] the church well if they belong to god
[1:15:14] that's what matters
[1:15:16] i wouldn't want to go badmouth one of
[1:15:17] god's children just because they're in
[1:15:18] disobedience still god's children
[1:15:24] god gave me an understanding i shouldn't
[1:15:25] do that there's many that steal his
[1:15:26] children they can't help
[1:15:29] because they act so much different
[1:15:31] sometimes they can't help it
[1:15:33] some of these old cold formal churches
[1:15:35] have gotten that spirit upon them and
[1:15:36] there is much in prison as israel was in
[1:15:39] prison just as much as moses went down
[1:15:41] there to deliver them from slavery human
[1:15:43] beings that loved jesus would serve him
[1:15:47] if they only knew what to serve him by
[1:15:50] now remember that they can't help it
[1:15:53] that's why he was asked him he lost his
[1:15:56] feeling
[1:15:57] his brotherly kindness you say well
[1:15:59] that's just a bunch of sinners he's
[1:16:00] saying it's church people
[1:16:02] people in churches if they're in the
[1:16:03] wrong kind of church
[1:16:06] listen why did he lose his feelings
[1:16:08] because churches rejected as religious
[1:16:12] people
[1:16:13] they're the hardest ones to deal with
[1:16:16] that's why i said earlier many times the
[1:16:18] sinner's easier in a natural sense to
[1:16:21] get along with because they just don't
[1:16:22] care about anything most of the time
[1:16:24] amen but you have to make it ever
[1:16:26] because listen we are the children of
[1:16:28] god
[1:16:29] that person next to you they're just as
[1:16:30] much a child of god as you are
[1:16:32] sometimes you have to make an extra
[1:16:34] effort
[1:16:35] to love them and don't lose your feeling
[1:16:37] form because like i said this is the day
[1:16:39] where the love of many is wax cold
[1:16:42] brother graham says don't lose the
[1:16:44] feeling of the people
[1:16:46] you must remember they're not made out
[1:16:48] of sawdust
[1:16:51] they are flesh and blood human beings
[1:16:54] and assault i think we forget many times
[1:16:56] the value of that person
[1:16:59] that person that
[1:17:01] i could i could tell testimony here
[1:17:06] there's a certain brother
[1:17:09] i don't think he might be telling me the
[1:17:10] story so i'm going to tell because i've
[1:17:11] told before but there's a certain
[1:17:13] brother and i've known him for years and
[1:17:14] he's he's kind of rough around the edges
[1:17:16] but i love him you know uh if i could
[1:17:19] just say this he uh
[1:17:21] he was in an accident one time and i
[1:17:23] won't go over all the details for the
[1:17:24] sake of time here but he was in an
[1:17:25] accident and uh
[1:17:27] he was sitting still and a vehicle
[1:17:28] rear-ended him at 55 over 55 miles an
[1:17:31] hour he was in his pickup truck it
[1:17:32] slammed into him they life-flighted him
[1:17:35] he was fixing to die
[1:17:36] and my wife actually sent me a text
[1:17:38] about it i didn't know what was all
[1:17:39] about but i was at work and the lord
[1:17:41] showed me in the vision i saw the
[1:17:43] accident taking place and the lord told
[1:17:45] me that he's not going to die he'll live
[1:17:48] and he'll walk out of that hospital
[1:17:51] and the doctors are saying they don't
[1:17:52] expect him to make it through the day if
[1:17:54] he does survive he'll never walk again
[1:17:58] and i
[1:17:58] texted the one brother at the hospital
[1:18:00] said you begin to pray it said the lord
[1:18:01] show me he'll live and he'll walk out
[1:18:03] there two days later
[1:18:05] that man walked out of the hospital
[1:18:08] he said brother why are you saying all
[1:18:09] this that's not the end of the story
[1:18:11] there's more to that but i tell this for
[1:18:12] a reason this same guy he ended up his
[1:18:15] his marriage went bad he left his wife
[1:18:18] he got a bunch of money made a mess out
[1:18:19] of his life
[1:18:22] by his own confession like i said i'm
[1:18:23] not i'm not saying this to embarrass him
[1:18:24] but he made a mess out of his life and
[1:18:27] i'll be honest i had a bad attitude
[1:18:28] about it i prayed for this man i spoke
[1:18:30] on this man's behalf i went before the
[1:18:32] lord you heard this testimony and i said
[1:18:34] lord i looked at the man one day and i
[1:18:36] said you know i i almost feel bad i wish
[1:18:39] you'd have died
[1:18:41] you'd have been better off in that
[1:18:42] condition than what you've done with
[1:18:43] your life but you know what the lord's
[1:18:45] done things in his life and he's back in
[1:18:47] church and he's still kind of a rough
[1:18:49] kind of a guy but you know what like i
[1:18:50] said god can love a carnal christian as
[1:18:52] much as a spiritual christian
[1:18:55] but my attitude has changed about him i
[1:18:56] love that guy so much you know why god
[1:18:58] loved that guy
[1:19:00] every time i look at his life i said
[1:19:01] that guy has made all kinds of mistakes
[1:19:04] and god loved him enough to give him a
[1:19:05] save his life
[1:19:07] i always look and say god sure loves
[1:19:08] that man i don't know why but
[1:19:11] i don't this is my part i don't know why
[1:19:13] he loves me either i used to look at
[1:19:14] that man and get frustrated why would
[1:19:17] god be so gracious to this guy and do
[1:19:19] all this and look what he's done with
[1:19:21] his life and then i begin to look at my
[1:19:22] own life more
[1:19:24] over the course of time i see where i'm
[1:19:25] at so you know what every time i look at
[1:19:27] that guy and say god loves that man so
[1:19:29] much if god can love him that much maybe
[1:19:31] god can love me that much too i believe
[1:19:33] he does
[1:19:35] we're looking at it the wrong way now
[1:19:37] why can't they be more like me thank god
[1:19:40] he has so much love for that man that
[1:19:42] supernaturally raised them up
[1:19:44] if god has that kind of love for him
[1:19:46] what about you and i today
[1:19:48] what about that person that maybe you
[1:19:50] don't get along with at church or maybe
[1:19:51] at home or work
[1:19:53] if you they're not sawed us we forget
[1:19:57] we get in the heat of an argument with a
[1:19:58] spouse or a brother or a sister and we
[1:20:01] say something we forget listen they're
[1:20:03] not just six foot of dirt
[1:20:05] they are but there's more to it they've
[1:20:06] got a soul they've got a life they've
[1:20:08] got a history
[1:20:10] they've got family and we forget about
[1:20:12] it
[1:20:14] and we say things that are hurtful to
[1:20:16] try to validate ourselves why are you
[1:20:19] trying to hurt him in the first place
[1:20:21] see the whole premise is wrong that's
[1:20:22] not your enemy
[1:20:24] that purse that person is not your enemy
[1:20:28] amen
[1:20:29] oh but brother you don't understand
[1:20:31] they're wrong
[1:20:32] that's got nothing to do with it
[1:20:34] well they deserve punishment deserves
[1:20:36] got nothing to do with it
[1:20:39] some of them are still god's children
[1:20:42] that doesn't mean god's just gonna let
[1:20:44] them do whatever they want all the time
[1:20:45] they get off they get let off the hook
[1:20:47] but it does mean they're still children
[1:20:50] he's the father not you
[1:20:55] brother rem says and
[1:20:57] he says the world is dying
[1:20:59] for love
[1:21:02] the church is dying
[1:21:04] for love
[1:21:08] jesus said you are the salt of the earth
[1:21:10] but if the salt has lost it savor it is
[1:21:12] henceforth good for nothing but to be
[1:21:14] trod under the feet of men
[1:21:16] and if the church has lost its divine
[1:21:19] revelation of the love of god
[1:21:21] it becomes a mock and a stalk and a
[1:21:24] stumbling block to the world
[1:21:26] now there's only one thing the church
[1:21:28] has to do if you want somebody to come
[1:21:29] to christ
[1:21:31] you be salty salt makes a thirst you be
[1:21:34] salty and the world
[1:21:36] will get thirsty
[1:21:38] that's right
[1:21:40] it's very important how we present the
[1:21:42] gospel in our lives
[1:21:45] it's very important that we
[1:21:47] take great care with one another
[1:21:50] like i said you have to make an effort
[1:21:52] to do that sometimes
[1:21:53] but god will honor that effort
[1:21:56] god wants to see as much as lives within
[1:21:58] you are you doing your part
[1:22:00] to strive together to endeavor to keep
[1:22:04] the bond of unity and peace
[1:22:07] it's funny i uh i didn't know which
[1:22:09] direction i was going this but i was
[1:22:09] thinking about last year i i preached uh
[1:22:11] i was preaching about the zeal of the
[1:22:12] lord's time about being angry and stuff
[1:22:14] there was a brother brother david was
[1:22:15] here he's like ah we're going to start
[1:22:17] start another revolution in this country
[1:22:18] i'm like well brother that wasn't
[1:22:20] quite what i was going for
[1:22:21] it was very like ah it's all about you
[1:22:23] know spiritual warfare or whatever but i
[1:22:26] think it's ironic today here we are
[1:22:28] striving to keep the bond of peace
[1:22:31] amen as you stand to your feet today
[1:22:35] let us endeavor to continue in that that
[1:22:38] bond
[1:22:40] now like i said at the beginning that
[1:22:42] that doesn't mean that you don't ever
[1:22:43] disagree that certainly doesn't mean
[1:22:45] you're not allowed to voice your
[1:22:47] disagreement
[1:22:48] but it does mean that you do it with the
[1:22:50] right motive and the right attitude
[1:22:53] and if somebody does that with you
[1:22:55] hopefully you can receive it
[1:22:58] not everything is a personal we we do
[1:23:00] that we view everything as a personal
[1:23:01] attack that's the world politics today
[1:23:03] well you you know you're you must be
[1:23:05] against me because you don't feel the
[1:23:06] same well that doesn't mean that at all
[1:23:07] i'm actually for you i just don't agree
[1:23:09] with you right
[1:23:11] you know how it is
[1:23:13] if somebody disagrees with you about
[1:23:14] something view it for what it is they
[1:23:16] just see it a different way
[1:23:17] and maybe they're right or maybe you're
[1:23:19] both kind of right be willing to listen
[1:23:22] to that person not just give them the
[1:23:23] brush off well they they never know what
[1:23:24] they're talking about well maybe they do
[1:23:25] this time even a broken clock right
[1:23:27] twice a day
[1:23:29] amen
[1:23:30] be long-suffering gentle patient with
[1:23:32] one another let's bow our heads once
[1:23:35] more heavenly father
[1:23:37] i thank you today for this time and this
[1:23:39] lovely group of people lord i don't i
[1:23:41] don't know all their situations well i
[1:23:43] know they've never had a disagreement
[1:23:45] among them lord i i do doubt that we're
[1:23:48] all human beings even even your early
[1:23:50] church those men that walked with you
[1:23:52] that handled you and your flesh they
[1:23:55] they disagreed with you
[1:23:57] they disagreed with one another but they
[1:23:59] were still brothers
[1:24:01] at the end of the day
[1:24:03] lord we're in a country in a time where
[1:24:05] people are more polarized all the time
[1:24:07] by their personal differences by
[1:24:09] politics
[1:24:11] lord it seems like nobody's willing to
[1:24:13] to mend the fence or reach across the
[1:24:15] table anymore
[1:24:17] lord it's the spirit of this age
[1:24:20] it's the spirit of the time that we're
[1:24:21] living in
[1:24:23] but father i pray that you'd help each
[1:24:24] of us
[1:24:26] not to be partakers of that same spirit
[1:24:30] lord we don't want to be united with a
[1:24:32] church conformity the world does that
[1:24:35] denominations do that
[1:24:37] or we don't want to be a bunch of cookie
[1:24:39] cutters trying to conform to a man's
[1:24:40] ideas but we're individuals you made us
[1:24:43] each different lord
[1:24:45] but i pray you'd help us as individuals
[1:24:47] with our own ideas
[1:24:49] our own directions
[1:24:51] having different goals in life many
[1:24:53] times
[1:24:54] ones called to one place one to another
[1:24:56] that we could continue and we would
[1:24:58] strengthen ourselves and working
[1:25:00] together lord if if there be any here
[1:25:02] today with a variance i pray that they'd
[1:25:03] take this time
[1:25:05] and reach across the table may they not
[1:25:07] wait for somebody else to make it right
[1:25:09] but may they do their part
[1:25:11] may they strive earnestly
[1:25:13] in their homes and in this church in
[1:25:16] their lives to be peaceable with all men
[1:25:18] as much as lies within them lord help us
[1:25:21] to be salt and light to this world and
[1:25:24] to one another lord i never want to be
[1:25:26] the reason
[1:25:28] i never want to be the reason my
[1:25:30] temperament my personality my own
[1:25:32] opinion i never want to be the reason
[1:25:34] that somebody walks away from the truth
[1:25:36] lord help us never
[1:25:37] never to be in a fence like that lord if
[1:25:39] the truth offends him it's one thing but
[1:25:41] lord may our personalities may we be so
[1:25:43] yielded to you
[1:25:44] may we be so sweet and humble lord that
[1:25:46] we're willing to turn the other cheek
[1:25:48] knowing it might affect somebody's
[1:25:50] eternal destination
[1:25:52] lord i've seen it so many times it
[1:25:53] breaks my heart lord i never
[1:25:55] i never want to be that one lord i never
[1:25:57] want to i never want to do that to
[1:25:59] somebody i believe that's each of us if
[1:26:01] we're if we're sincere today if we're
[1:26:03] earnest none of us want to do that lord
[1:26:05] it's so easy the bible says in many
[1:26:08] things we offend
[1:26:10] our tongue such an unruly member
[1:26:13] lord it's so easy
[1:26:16] it's so easy for us to say hurtful
[1:26:18] things
[1:26:19] it's so easy for us to say heated things
[1:26:22] may we be so quick to say i'm sorry
[1:26:26] maybe we'd be so quick to say i forgive
[1:26:28] you
[1:26:30] maybe we'll be so swift
[1:26:32] in our speaking
[1:26:34] they say i love you too
[1:26:38] may we not hide our light under the
[1:26:39] bushel today
[1:26:41] may we present it may you send the light
[1:26:42] i pray
[1:26:44] and each of our lives one towards
[1:26:45] another lord
[1:26:47] sometimes in this great
[1:26:48] chaos and sea of life
[1:26:51] we find ourselves in great darkness may
[1:26:52] we be lights one to another lord
[1:26:56] be gentle and patient and apt
[1:26:59] not striving with other men but seeking
[1:27:01] to persuade them
[1:27:03] to draw closer to you bless this church
