[0:55] god bless you this evening we certainly
[0:59] appreciate every effort put forth to
[1:02] make this the best worship service we
[1:04] could have
[1:05] because sometimes
[1:07] it's easier than others and sometimes it
[1:09] takes a greater sacrifice
[1:12] and i do believe that god looks at your
[1:15] sacrifice
[1:17] and so may the lord bless you turn with
[1:19] me if you would to the we got three
[1:21] opening scriptures today the first is in
[1:23] first peter chapter five verse eight
[1:27] first peter chapter five matthew chapter
[1:30] 24
[1:32] and amos chapter six
[1:34] um
[1:36] we want to
[1:37] welcome brother bob crawford with us
[1:40] today god bless you brother bob
[1:45] i've often said i've said it to him i've
[1:47] said it to
[1:49] many he's
[1:52] one of the
[1:55] major
[1:56] reasons
[1:57] god has used him
[2:00] for sunderlight
[2:03] in so many ways
[2:06] and
[2:08] his prayer for
[2:09] us from
[2:11] the beginning before we ever preached
[2:14] and
[2:16] we just are in debt
[2:19] uh to that
[2:21] to him
[2:22] to the lord through him
[2:25] um
[2:26] and we just want to be faithful till we
[2:29] leave here
[2:30] amen
[2:31] amen before we read this word let's just
[2:34] look to the author dear heavenly father
[2:37] we thank you for this precious time
[2:39] together together we're just
[2:41] a few many are missing
[2:43] uh some are sick
[2:45] um
[2:46] some
[2:47] are afflicted and
[2:49] and
[2:50] some are have other
[2:53] work and other reasons that they're not
[2:55] here
[2:56] but god you're faithful to be here
[2:58] because you said we're just two or three
[3:00] would be gathered in your name you'd be
[3:02] right in the midst lord
[3:04] and father we're not asking that we feel
[3:06] you today we're not asking that we see
[3:08] the manifestation of you today but lord
[3:10] what we are asking is that we have faith
[3:13] to believe that you do the supernatural
[3:16] work in our hearts today
[3:19] lord you said blessed is he
[3:23] that believeth and has not seen lord we
[3:26] want to be part of that group today take
[3:28] the word lord that you have given us and
[3:32] open our eyes to see the real meaning
[3:35] and how we can better our lives bless
[3:38] each one meet the needs that be amongst
[3:40] us we'll be sure to give you the praise
[3:42] and honor for these things for we ask it
[3:44] in jesus precious name amen
[3:47] amen
[3:49] so in first peter chapter five verse
[3:51] number eight
[3:52] be sober
[3:54] be vigilant
[3:56] because your adversary the devil is a
[3:57] royal lion walketh about seeking
[4:01] whom he may devour
[4:04] and then matthew 24
[4:08] so no matter how predestinated we are
[4:11] peter is telling the reader to be sober
[4:14] and to be vigilant
[4:16] and that word vigilant means to keep
[4:19] awake or watch
[4:22] and here
[4:24] jesus also given us
[4:26] a warning in matthew chapter 24 42
[4:31] watch
[4:32] therefore for ye know not the hour your
[4:36] lord
[4:37] doth return so the predestined they
[4:39] don't know what our our lord's returning
[4:42] and so we have a job as predestined
[4:44] christians to watch therefore
[4:48] and then amos
[4:50] chapter six verse one
[4:53] amos chapter six verse one woe
[4:55] to them
[4:57] that are at ease
[4:59] in zion
[5:01] and trust in the mountains of samaria
[5:04] which are name chief of the nations
[5:07] to whom the house of israel
[5:10] came
[5:11] god bless you may be seated may god
[5:14] bless us tonight with his word
[5:17] we want to entitle this message
[5:18] remaining vigilant
[5:20] amen
[5:22] we're
[5:24] nearer the hour of his coming than we've
[5:26] ever been
[5:28] brother branham says this in the message
[5:30] jezebel religion he says exactly right
[5:33] pinch your conscience you christian
[5:37] wake yourself up it's later than you
[5:40] think
[5:42] and of course
[5:43] the devil
[5:45] has made the whole world to feel
[5:48] um
[5:49] like they can just do whatever they want
[5:51] it's going to be okay
[5:55] and he has a way of getting into
[5:59] christian lives and making them to feel
[6:03] that
[6:04] where they're at is okay
[6:10] but peter said be sober that means
[6:12] spiritually sober
[6:15] to be vigilant to to keep awake and
[6:18] watch because the devil
[6:21] is trying to devour us
[6:26] woe to them that are at ease
[6:31] the foundation i just want to have a
[6:33] little start a little foundation of the
[6:35] word woe
[6:37] i i was just walking in the kitchen and
[6:39] this
[6:40] this
[6:41] scripture came to me woe unto them that
[6:43] are the ease in zion and i thought where
[6:45] did that come from
[6:46] and that's really where this whole
[6:48] service started with
[6:50] and i want to go with it that word woe
[6:52] means it's used to express grief regret
[6:56] or distress
[6:57] anguish
[6:59] ruinous trouble affliction
[7:01] or calamity
[7:03] whoa to them that are ease in zion it's
[7:06] not good enough to be in zion
[7:11] and
[7:13] we when we hear some real bad news let
[7:15] me get an automobile accident when i
[7:17] heard um
[7:18] one of my employees got in a real bad uh
[7:20] automobile accident we can react with
[7:24] whoa are you serious i can't believe it
[7:27] and it it with a agree for a distress
[7:30] and any time we hear some real bad news
[7:32] it's whoa whoa wait a minute this can't
[7:35] be serious
[7:37] jesus used this word woe often when he
[7:40] spoke of the self-righteous people in
[7:42] his day he said woe unto you scribes and
[7:45] pharisees and hypocrites
[7:47] woe unto you blind guides he said
[7:51] in other words ruinous trouble unto you
[7:54] scribes and pharisees
[7:57] calamity unto you ye blind guides
[8:02] they don't realize it but distress and
[8:04] anguish
[8:06] awaits them
[8:08] jesus warned every human being not to
[8:11] enter the wrong gate because it led to
[8:14] hell
[8:15] he said in matthew 7 verse 13 i know you
[8:18] know some of these scriptures but i'm
[8:20] just trying to lay and you know me a
[8:21] lengthy foundation
[8:23] entering into straight gate for wide is
[8:25] the gate and broad is the way that
[8:27] leadeth unto destruction and many there
[8:29] be which going they're at so jesus is
[8:32] warning and he's saying whoa
[8:35] whoa destruction
[8:37] it's wide it's broad it's a spacious way
[8:40] that seems to lead to a ruinous
[8:43] destruction a calamity
[8:46] don't go there
[8:48] further in the chapter jesus goes to say
[8:50] in verse 22 he said that many will say
[8:53] to me in that day lord lord have we not
[8:55] we prophesy in the name and in thy name
[8:57] cast out devils and in thy name then
[8:59] many wonderful works
[9:01] i think many will really be saying lord
[9:04] didn't i do the most important things
[9:08] because he's bringing these most
[9:10] important things to his attention and
[9:12] then while i profess unto them i never
[9:14] knew you depart from me ye that work
[9:17] iniquity
[9:19] so woe to the broadway amen
[9:22] new york has a broad way
[9:24] woe to the broad way
[9:28] jesus said in verse 21 not everyone that
[9:31] saith unto me lord shall enter into the
[9:33] kingdom of heaven but he that doeth the
[9:36] will of my father which is in heaven
[9:38] amen
[9:40] woe unto them that profess and follow
[9:43] not the word
[9:45] right amen
[9:47] it's not the most important things that
[9:49] matter to god
[9:51] is building your life with every word of
[9:53] god that matters to god that's right god
[9:55] is interested in his whole word for our
[9:57] lives
[9:59] and i think that's why few people
[10:01] don't enter the straight gate it's just
[10:03] too straight
[10:04] he said in verse 14 straight as the gate
[10:06] narrows the way which death unto life
[10:08] and few be that findeth
[10:11] and then he says in verse 15
[10:13] beware of false prophets or woe
[10:18] which come to you in sheep's clothing
[10:20] but inwardly
[10:22] there are raving wolves
[10:24] now a prophet is somebody that's
[10:26] spiritual
[10:27] or acts that way
[10:31] and they have
[10:32] enough word
[10:34] to get your attention
[10:38] but they also have enough
[10:40] of their own interest to deceive you
[10:45] woe unto them who appear to be a
[10:47] christian but their intents are not
[10:50] living for others
[10:54] sheep's clothing
[10:55] but inwardly it's about them
[10:58] and not about others
[11:01] they may speak part of the word but they
[11:03] leave out the part that's the part of
[11:05] responsibility of of living for others
[11:08] and loving others and laying down your
[11:09] life
[11:11] so whoa beware of false prophets woe
[11:14] unto the blind guides they will lead you
[11:16] to calamity
[11:19] are you with me amen
[11:22] another woe jesus talked about luke
[11:24] chapter 6 verse 24
[11:26] but woe unto you that are rich
[11:29] for you have received your consolation
[11:33] obviously god does not want us to have
[11:36] too much comfort
[11:39] he doesn't
[11:42] it seems like the more that people have
[11:46] the more they have for the devil to use
[11:48] to distract them away from god
[11:52] in fact jesus was warning his disciples
[11:54] about riches in matthew chapter 19 verse
[11:57] 23 and he says verily i say unto you
[11:59] that
[12:00] a rich man shall hardly enter
[12:03] into the kingdom of heaven
[12:07] well he's not a respecter of persons now
[12:09] he's not biased
[12:13] he's not
[12:14] racist
[12:17] but he knows that riches
[12:21] hinder the majority of the people right
[12:23] true
[12:24] and again i say unto you it is easier
[12:26] for a camel to go through the eye of a
[12:27] needle than for a rich man to enter into
[12:30] the kingdom of god woe unto the rich
[12:34] but humans want to be rich
[12:40] first timothy 6 8
[12:42] and having food and remnant let us
[12:45] be there with
[12:47] content
[12:48] one of the hardest things to do is to be
[12:50] content
[12:52] but they that will be rich in other
[12:54] words those that says i don't i'm not
[12:56] really interested in being content right
[12:58] now i'm going for it
[13:00] but they that will be rich that have
[13:02] that desire that they're going to go for
[13:04] what's going to happen let's look at the
[13:05] calamity now
[13:07] the walls
[13:08] fall into temptation and a snare and
[13:12] into many foolish and hurtful
[13:16] lust
[13:17] which actually drowned men in
[13:19] destruction and
[13:21] perdition
[13:23] so be careful what you're wanting
[13:26] for the love of of money is the root of
[13:29] all evil which while some coveted after
[13:33] they have
[13:34] erred from the faith
[13:37] and pierced themselves through with many
[13:40] sorrows
[13:42] so strong desire for money leads to
[13:44] calamity to the majority
[13:47] james chapter 5 verse 1 go to now ye
[13:50] rich men weep and howl for your miseries
[13:53] that shall come upon you
[13:57] so it's just like a pred
[14:00] a prediction
[14:01] it's just a well-known fact
[14:03] paul knows about it james knows about it
[14:06] jesus talked about it uh money is a woe
[14:11] whoa
[14:12] it's okay that we don't have a lot of
[14:14] money it's okay
[14:16] it's really okay because if you had a
[14:19] lot you'd have a lot more problems you
[14:20] just don't realize it yet right it's
[14:22] true
[14:25] so woe means
[14:26] stop heading in that direction
[14:30] another wall here in luke chapter
[14:32] 6 verse 25 woe unto you that are full
[14:37] for you
[14:38] for ye shall hunger
[14:40] want you that laugh now for you shall
[14:43] mourn and weep
[14:45] so obviously god doesn't want us to be
[14:47] too full and he doesn't want us walking
[14:49] around laughing all the time
[14:52] right
[14:56] do you believe that amen i i know i i
[14:59] i'm trying to bring a point i could
[15:02] spend
[15:03] the whole service on one verse but
[15:06] you got to go with me here
[15:10] verse 26 woe unto you when all men shall
[15:14] speak well of you
[15:16] for so did their fathers
[15:18] to the false prophets now we all want
[15:21] somebody to say something nice about us
[15:25] but if everybody was doing it you're in
[15:27] trouble
[15:28] right you're in trouble
[15:31] so if somebody doesn't say something
[15:33] nice about you it's okay it's it needs
[15:36] to be that way for you to be right
[15:40] don't feel bad about it
[15:44] so there's a woes here
[15:46] that get you in trouble
[15:49] woe unto them that are in laodicea right
[15:53] revelations 3 verse 14 and the angel of
[15:56] the church of laodiceans write these
[15:58] things saith the amen the faithful the
[16:00] true witness and beginning of the
[16:02] creation of god i know thy works that
[16:04] thou art neither cold nor hot
[16:06] i would that you were cold or hot
[16:09] so then because thou art in between
[16:12] lukewarm neither cold nor hot i will
[16:15] spew thee out of my mouth
[16:19] woe unto them that are lukewarm in
[16:22] laodicea amen
[16:25] if i could say it like this god really
[16:27] hates the taste
[16:29] of uncommitment in his mouth god wants
[16:32] to seek commitment one way or the other
[16:35] but this thing of i am not going to make
[16:37] a decision because i want to go with my
[16:39] flesh and i want to go with god he just
[16:41] so against that
[16:44] because thou sayest
[16:46] i am rich and increased with goods and
[16:49] have need of nothing
[16:51] sounds like they're at ease huh
[16:54] and know us not that they're rich and
[16:56] miserable poor and blind and naked
[16:58] they don't even know the woe is coming
[17:01] yet
[17:02] woe unto them that say i have need of
[17:06] nothing
[17:10] we don't want that attitude
[17:13] we don't want the the attitude of uh
[17:16] it's okay if i'm not hungry
[17:18] if i'm not thirsting if i'm not seeking
[17:22] because calamity is on the horizon
[17:27] how many are happy that god brought you
[17:29] out of
[17:30] laodicea amen am i talking to the right
[17:33] group amen
[17:35] we heard
[17:36] the angel's
[17:38] messenger we we heard god's messenger
[17:40] the angel to laodicea calling us to come
[17:44] out and and and and to separate and
[17:47] revelations 18 verse 4 says i heard
[17:50] another voice from heaven saying come
[17:51] out of her my people that ye be not
[17:53] partakers of her sins and that you
[17:55] receive not of her plagues
[17:59] god was speaking from heaven through a
[18:02] messenger and we
[18:04] heard his voice my sheep hear my voice
[18:07] and they follow me amen and we're here
[18:10] today because of it by the grace of god
[18:12] amen but i want to focus on a particular
[18:14] woe tonight it's not being lukewarm in
[18:17] laodicea
[18:18] it's not being taken the easy way
[18:22] in laodicea
[18:24] it's
[18:25] it's taking it easy hanging out with god
[18:31] woe unto them that are ease in zion
[18:36] amen amen
[18:38] zion is the place where god dwells
[18:43] i know this kind of sounds weird doesn't
[18:45] it
[18:49] psalms 132 13 for the lord have chosen
[18:53] zion
[18:54] he have desired it for his habitation
[18:57] amen
[18:58] this is the rest
[19:00] this is my rest forever here will i
[19:02] dwell for i have desired it
[19:08] joel
[19:09] 3 16
[19:11] joel 3 16 the lord also shall roar out
[19:14] of zion and utter his voice from
[19:17] jerusalem and the heavens and the earth
[19:19] shall shake but the lord will he
[19:22] will be the hope of his people and the
[19:24] strength of the children of israel so
[19:26] shall ye know that i am the lord your
[19:29] god dwelling in zion my holy mountain
[19:32] then shall jerusalem be holy and there
[19:35] shall no strangers pass through here
[19:37] anymore one more isaiah 57 13
[19:42] the last part of it that he putteth he
[19:44] that putteth his trust in me
[19:46] shall possess the land and shall inherit
[19:49] my holy mountain and shall say
[19:52] up cast ye up prepare ye prepare the way
[19:56] take up the stumbling block out of the
[19:57] way of my people for thus saith the high
[20:00] and lofty one that inhabits eternity
[20:03] whose name is holy i dwell in the high
[20:07] and holy place
[20:09] now this is that holy mountain with him
[20:12] also that is of a contrite and humble
[20:15] spirit to revive the spirit of the
[20:16] humble and to revive the heart of the
[20:18] contrite ones
[20:20] this holy mountain is where god dwells
[20:24] it's the secret place of the most high
[20:27] amen and from here he roars he utters
[20:29] his voice
[20:31] when god has spoken to you
[20:34] he has spoken amen
[20:37] from mount zion
[20:38] that's that's where the it came from
[20:40] amen
[20:41] now this high and holy place it's filled
[20:45] with
[20:46] humility
[20:48] that's why he dwells
[20:50] only with those of a humble spirit in
[20:52] the heart of the contrite ones he said
[20:55] learning me for i am meek and lowly
[20:58] god hid himself in a human being
[21:01] called jesus born in the stable
[21:04] hid himself from the wise and the
[21:05] prudent
[21:07] now he that putteth his trust in me
[21:09] shall possess the land and inherit my
[21:12] holy mountain but woe unto them that are
[21:15] at ease in zion amen
[21:19] not in the world not laodicea but woe
[21:21] unto them that are eased in god's
[21:23] dwelling place in god's
[21:28] house need to stop laying around on
[21:32] god's mountain amen
[21:35] when we hear god roar and utter his
[21:37] voice we need to stand up and do what he
[21:40] told us to do
[21:44] woe to them that are taking it easy
[21:47] where god is living

[22:14] and his rules are you don't take it easy

[23:13] how could god want us to feel how could
[23:16] god not want us to feel secure dwelling
[23:19] in his place
[23:22] but that word
[23:24] security is not
[23:26] genuine
[23:27] security
[23:29] it's a false sense of security
[23:32] woe to them that have a false sense of
[23:35] security in zion amen whoa
[23:39] whoa whoa we went through the walls we
[23:42] know how bad the walls are
[23:45] so we need to take it seriously about a
[23:47] false sense of security
[23:50] now there is a true doctrine of eternal
[23:53] security
[23:56] where nothing can separate you from the
[23:58] love of god
[24:00] there's a true doctrine of
[24:01] predestination
[24:03] by god's foreknowledge
[24:06] and a true revelation of this doctrine
[24:08] gives the believer true security
[24:15] where nothing can stop him from
[24:17] fulfilling god's eternal purpose
[24:20] that's what that's what it does
[24:25] no matter what the devil throws at them
[24:26] no matter how many times they fall
[24:29] no matter what sin they've committed
[24:31] outside of blasphemy
[24:33] nothing can keep them down
[24:36] nothing can keep them from getting up
[24:38] back up and serving god with all their
[24:40] hearts
[24:42] if they fall seven times seven times
[24:43] they get back up they keep serving god
[24:46] with all their heart
[24:48] a true revelation of eternal security
[24:50] will help you get back up and keep
[24:54] war walking forward with god in the work
[24:56] of the lord
[24:58] that's what it's for
[25:00] it's to keep it's to it's to help you
[25:03] when you fall to know where you belong
[25:07] that's what it does
[25:10] in fact romans 8 1 says there is
[25:12] therefore now no condemnation to them
[25:15] which are in christ jesus who walk not
[25:17] after the flesh but after the spirit
[25:22] but if a believer has only had knowledge
[25:24] of predestination
[25:26] it is most likely
[25:29] puts their flesh at ease
[25:34] in other words i know i'm predestinated
[25:38] it will give them a false security
[25:42] it will make them at ease in zion
[25:44] lukewarm with god neither hot or cold
[25:47] right that's right
[25:49] they feel they can get by with just a
[25:51] form of godliness they don't have to
[25:53] worry about having all the power in
[25:54] their life
[25:57] make them feel like they're in need of
[25:59] nothing that they don't need to work out
[26:01] their salvation with fear and trembling
[26:03] that it's already settled god already
[26:05] paid the price
[26:07] that they don't really have to exercise
[26:09] the humble spirit of i could be wrong
[26:12] they can maybe have to say the words but
[26:14] they don't have to feel it that they
[26:15] really could be wrong
[26:17] come on this is what head knowledge of
[26:20] predestination will do to somebody
[26:23] so there is a false doctrine of
[26:25] eternal security
[26:27] we've heard about it in the other
[26:28] denominations once saved always saved no
[26:31] matter what your attitude is no matter
[26:33] what you decide to do it's already done
[26:37] it's like no accountability in that
[26:42] god's word warns that the believer can
[26:44] have their names taken out of the book
[26:46] of life
[26:48] jude 1 5 says i will therefore put you
[26:50] in remembrance so he once knew this that
[26:53] how that how the lord
[26:56] how that the lord having saved the
[26:57] people of the land of age afterwards
[26:59] destroyed them that believed
[27:02] not
[27:02] so there wasn't too much
[27:04] eternal security in that was it they
[27:07] could testify that god brought them out
[27:09] of egypt did all these miracles they
[27:11] were dancing and they were heaven they
[27:13] were delivered from their the worst
[27:16] demons right it's true
[27:18] but what happened when they didn't
[27:19] continue to keep walking
[27:21] amen amen
[27:23] jesus said he that believeth he that
[27:26] believeth to the end the same shall be
[27:27] saved
[27:29] hebrews 3 6 but christ as a son over his
[27:32] own house whose house we are if
[27:35] we continue to hold fast the confidence
[27:38] and rejoicing of hope firm to the end
[27:42] so we see here that there is a
[27:44] false doctrine of eternal security
[27:49] there is a
[27:51] a false security in zion
[27:54] on god's mountain
[27:56] that we can be at ease in god's house or
[27:59] god's dwelling in it
[28:02] and
[28:02] and god is saying whoa
[28:05] whoa
[28:06] get rid of that
[28:11] lot
[28:12] who walked with the prophet abraham
[28:15] was at ease in zion
[28:18] he chose the easier path because
[28:20] he had a false sense of security
[28:23] i walked with the prophet i i know him
[28:28] but it ended up in calamity we could say
[28:31] whoa onto lot
[28:34] same with balaam
[28:35] balaam was at ease in zion
[28:38] god's prophet he said i speak only those
[28:40] things that god puts in my mouth
[28:43] and god told him not to go but what
[28:45] happened balaam went
[28:47] anyways because he wanted a personal
[28:49] gain
[28:50] and he wanted that more than he wanted
[28:52] god's perfect will because god's prophet
[28:54] will said don't go
[28:57] so he was definitely at ease he was
[29:00] being used by god and at the same time
[29:02] he was he was trying to exercise
[29:04] something that would be personal for him
[29:07] that's being at ease in zion that's
[29:09] without the fear of the lord
[29:12] jude chapter 1 jude chapter 1
[29:16] why do i still do that i will do that
[29:17] forever
[29:20] because i want to clarify that just in
[29:23] case anybody's doubting there's only one
[29:25] chapter
[29:27] jude 1 verse 10 but
[29:29] these speak evil
[29:31] of those things which they know not but
[29:34] they
[29:35] but what they know naturally as brute
[29:37] beasts in those things which they
[29:39] corrupt themselves woe unto them
[29:43] for they
[29:44] have gone the way of cain
[29:46] and ran greedily after the error of
[29:50] balaam they actually ran right towards
[29:55] the air
[29:56] not like
[29:58] stumble over it no
[29:59] they ran for it
[30:01] the air of balaam
[30:04] for
[30:05] reward
[30:10] don't go but he went anyways
[30:13] look at the grief the regret the anguish
[30:16] the calamity
[30:17] that balaam ended up with
[30:21] he was spiritual enough
[30:24] to speak the word of god
[30:28] but carnal enough to talk to a donkey
[30:33] and not
[30:34] repent
[30:36] quickly as soon as he realized
[30:44] i say too many gifted believers make the
[30:47] same error that balaam made
[30:49] i want you to listen this
[30:51] and that mistake is this that while
[30:53] they work for the lord
[30:56] they go after some personal gain at the
[30:59] same time
[31:02] it don't have to be the same volume in
[31:04] the same way in the same gift
[31:07] but
[31:07] look
[31:09] when that's happening you're at ease in
[31:10] zion
[31:12] you're right at ease in zion in god's
[31:14] dwelling
[31:17] these are spots in your feast or charity
[31:20] when they feast with you feeding
[31:21] themselves without fear
[31:26] like
[31:27] i don't need to do everything
[31:31] i just want to come to church and pick
[31:33] out the part i want
[31:36] lord help us amen
[31:38] lord help us yes
[31:40] woe unto them that are
[31:42] eased right inside of zion that is just
[31:46] hard to comprehend that we could be
[31:48] that tight with god
[31:50] growing in his presence and then be at
[31:53] ease
[31:56] look it's not something i'm making up
[31:57] it's the scriptures
[32:00] brother branham had to answer for this
[32:02] here in
[32:03] uh i just want to read about eight
[32:05] quotes real quick who have believed a
[32:06] report brother it says oh christians
[32:08] pinch the inside man now
[32:11] and wake up to the reality that jesus
[32:13] christ is here
[32:15] to manifest himself to you
[32:19] he's here
[32:20] but he says pinch the inside man
[32:23] and the message jesus christ is saying
[32:24] yesterday today and forever he says oh

[32:29] in your spirit
[32:31] why do you come so numb in your spirit

[33:10] don't see these things that jesus said
[33:12] that he would be with me and these
[33:14] things would go on i don't see them
[33:16] what's the matter lord jesus

[33:37] membership if it costs me the prestige

[33:41] lord's despise to you
[33:43] right amen
[33:45] sirs we would see jesus brother bran
[33:47] says no
[33:48] don't pinch your flesh now remember many
[33:51] times sitting in church
[33:53] when i wasn't a preacher
[33:57] when i wasn't preaching up here and i'd
[33:59] be listening and i would be so tired i'd
[34:01] be falling asleep and i'd have to bite
[34:03] my tongue and i'd pinch my flesh
[34:05] to try to stay awake
[34:07] i don't know if you ever did that i did
[34:09] that
[34:10] it was a way to kind of wake up don't go
[34:12] to sleep and sometimes i've had to do
[34:14] that driving right you know you're
[34:16] getting real tired and you got to do
[34:18] something throw down your window but
[34:20] when was i pinched my flesh but brother
[34:23] brian i'm saying here's now don't pitch

[34:34] i'm missing this what the preacher's
[34:37] trying to get to me i'm trying to get
[34:39] this
[34:40] he's given us a way how we can get out
[34:44] of our flesh and into the spirit and and
[34:47] get a hold of god amen
[34:50] don't be at ease in zion
[34:53] handwriting on the wall brother man says
[34:55] don't the bible say that
[34:58] that would be that way that they'd be
[35:00] heading high minded lovers of pleasure
[35:01] more than lovers of god true breakers
[35:03] incontinent fears and despisers of those
[35:05] that are right with god
[35:07] what a day that we're living in now i
[35:09] want you to pinch your spiritual
[35:11] conscience
[35:14] message abraham brother bram says oh
[35:16] why
[35:17] be so gross amen just have faith
[35:21] don't you see friends
[35:23] can you wake up pentecostal people
[35:26] won't you bite your conscience won't you
[35:28] pinch your soul i mean he's really just
[35:32] you know and a lot of times we're just
[35:34] looking at the outward appearance of
[35:36] things
[35:37] you know what i mean
[35:40] god deals with the inside of us
[35:43] in the message perfect faith
[35:45] brother bran says the devil has put
[35:47] everything in the world before you to
[35:49] try to keep you from believing
[35:51] it
[35:52] he'll bring it in a meeting and try to
[35:54] throw everything he can right in front
[35:56] of you
[35:58] he said shake it away from you the bible
[36:00] says rise and shake yourself pinch
[36:03] yourself
[36:08] sometimes we just
[36:10] well we'll just let it go by don't need
[36:12] to really dig in i don't understand it
[36:14] it's just almost late i'm tired
[36:16] you can't do that that's you know
[36:18] brother branham is teaching us what we
[36:20] need to do
[36:21] but if we don't practice this then we're
[36:24] really at ease in zion and we don't
[36:26] realize it but i'll say woe unto you
[36:29] amen
[36:30] and the last one here brother brahm said
[36:32] in the message desperations this one's
[36:34] often quoted
[36:36] uh in the message you can't be desperate
[36:38] until god speaks to you
[36:41] i love that you can't be desperate until
[36:43] god speaks to you
[36:45] so what do you have to do brother
[36:46] branham says oh church rise and shake
[36:49] yourself amen in other words if you
[36:51] really want god to deal with you
[36:53] you've got to shake yourself
[36:55] god didn't put us in a state of ease
[36:58] we did and he's expecting us to get out
[37:01] of it
[37:02] pinch your conscience wake yourself up
[37:05] in this hour we must be desperate or a
[37:08] perish
[37:10] there is coming forth something
[37:12] from the lord i know it is as thus saith
[37:16] the lord there is coming for something
[37:19] and we better get desperate it's between
[37:22] life
[37:23] and death
[37:24] and it will pass through us
[37:26] and we won't see it
[37:30] whoa
[37:31] in other words it's going to happen no
[37:33] matter what
[37:36] but if we
[37:37] aren't serious
[37:40] about being
[37:42] vigilant about our spiritual walk
[37:48] then it's going to pass us by right
[37:50] because we're going to fall if we're not
[37:51] vigilant we're going to fall into this
[37:53] at ease and the only time that we
[37:56] get uh
[37:57] uh up and going is if somebody around us
[37:59] is creating that atmosphere of doing it
[38:01] we can't do that
[38:03] you can't wait to come to church to pray
[38:06] you can't wait to come to church you've
[38:09] got to dig into christ
[38:13] amen
[38:14] romans chapter 13 verse 11
[38:16] and that now the time
[38:20] and that knowing the time
[38:23] that now is the high time to wake out of
[38:26] our sleep so we read some quotes that
[38:28] brother branham said now we're going to
[38:29] read the scriptures about it for now is
[38:31] our salvation nearer than when we
[38:33] believed
[38:35] the night is first but the day is at
[38:37] hand let us therefore cast off the works
[38:39] of darkness and let us put on the armor
[38:41] of light let's walk honestly in the day
[38:43] not riding in drunkenness not chambering
[38:45] that wanting us not in strife and envy
[38:48] see these are signs of being at ease
[38:52] that's what these are these are signs of
[38:54] of being at ease
[38:56] but put you on the lord jesus christ and
[38:58] make that provision for the flesh to
[38:59] fulfill the lust thereof amen
[39:02] first corinthians chapter 15 verse 33
[39:05] sorry there's a lot of scriptures
[39:07] tonight i have a lot of stuff to go
[39:09] through and that's kind of why i'm
[39:10] going so fast but
[39:12] hopefully it's okay
[39:15] the bible says be not deceived evil
[39:17] communications corrupt good manners yes
[39:20] i'll say like this be careful how you
[39:22] communicate
[39:24] verse 34 now awake
[39:27] to righteousness
[39:29] awake
[39:30] to righteous i'll just say awake
[39:33] out of ease
[39:36] amen
[39:37] because when you're at ease you're
[39:39] sinning right
[39:40] yeah it's true so awake to righteousness
[39:43] and sin not for some have not the
[39:44] knowledge of god i speak this to your
[39:47] shame
[39:48] and one more here
[39:50] in ephesians chapter 5 verse 14
[39:53] wherefore he saith awake thou that
[39:55] sleepest and arise from the dead
[39:59] and christ shall give thee light
[40:01] see that you walk circumspectly not as
[40:04] fools
[40:06] in other words you know you're walking
[40:08] vigilant you know where you're standing
[40:11] but as wise how what does a wise person
[40:14] do he redeems the time
[40:17] he doesn't sit around waiting for the
[40:19] coming of the lord
[40:24] he's redeeming the time that's wise
[40:27] because the days are evil we're for be
[40:29] not ye unwise but understanding what the
[40:32] will of the lord is
[40:35] the lord wants us working and he wants
[40:38] us laboring for the kingdom
[40:40] he doesn't want us taking it easy in his
[40:43] dwelling house just sitting there
[40:47] taking it easy
[40:48] being with god
[40:52] whoa
[40:54] right amen
[40:56] did i give you enough scriptures yet
[40:58] now i'm going to keep giving them amen
[41:00] because i want you to go i don't want
[41:02] you to doubt this message amen it's
[41:04] amazing to me how many people are
[41:06] waiting around for
[41:10] i don't know what they're waiting around
[41:11] for right
[41:14] when it comes to god they're just
[41:15] waiting for
[41:19] they're at ease in zion
[41:21] turn with me if you went to luke chapter
[41:23] 9 verse 11. now if you would turn with
[41:25] me if you would on this one or you could
[41:27] watch on the board but i want to read
[41:29] this whole parable here salvation had
[41:31] just come to the house of zacchaeus
[41:35] and jesus in in the
[41:38] the scripture starts here in verse 11
[41:40] for us and as they heard these things
[41:42] that what happened in zacchaeus house he
[41:45] added and spake a parable because there
[41:48] was a reason he was nine to jerusalem
[41:50] and because they thought that the
[41:52] kingdom of god should immediately appear
[41:57] so the reason that jesus was sharing
[41:59] this parable is because of their
[42:00] attitude that they had about god coming
[42:03] soon
[42:06] he's giving them the mind of christ on
[42:08] this subject he's teaching them to be
[42:10] god-conscious that's why he's given this
[42:12] parable and in verse 12 he says he said
[42:14] therefore a certain noble men went
[42:18] into a far country to receive for
[42:20] himself a kingdom and to return
[42:23] and he called his ten servants and
[42:25] delivered them ten pounds and said unto
[42:27] them occupy
[42:29] till i come
[42:30] in other words don't be at ease in zion
[42:36] but as citizens they hated them
[42:39] in other words they'd really rather be
[42:40] at ease
[42:42] rather be at ease and send a message
[42:44] after him saying
[42:46] we will not
[42:48] have this man to reign over us so i'm
[42:51] not going to
[42:56] church i'm not going to read the message
[43:00] i'm not going to dig into what this is
[43:02] really telling me i'm just going to only
[43:04] read the bible listen to tapes for the
[43:06] things that i've been i'm looking for
[43:09] i'm not interested in the whole word i'm
[43:11] just interested in the word that makes
[43:13] me helps me gives me what i want
[43:21] imagine that there's something
[43:23] about god's word
[43:24] that you hate
[43:27] that means there's something about god
[43:29] you hate
[43:32] you've got to love the word
[43:34] love it with all your heart
[43:37] amen
[43:39] the flesh is never ever
[43:41] going to be excited
[43:44] about crucifix being crucified
[43:48] romans 8 verse 7 says because
[43:51] the carnal mind is enmity against god
[43:53] for it is not subject to the law of god
[43:55] neither indeed can be
[43:58] and that's why we have to crucify
[43:59] ourselves that's why we have to deny
[44:01] ourselves daily
[44:03] because we it just won't be subject to
[44:05] god
[44:08] so he gives
[44:10] them this message of occupy till i come
[44:13] he doesn't tell him exactly what to do
[44:15] he he just wants him to go do something
[44:19] the word occupy means to busy oneself
[44:23] it also means if you look it up there
[44:26] i did
[44:27] in the greek it means to trade
[44:30] this word occupy means to trade if i
[44:33] said occupy
[44:35] you know i want you to come over uh
[44:37] brother mark you're gonna come over
[44:38] you're gonna watch your house while
[44:40] we're gone
[44:41] i want you to if i'm gonna pay you i
[44:43] want to occu i want you to occupy i
[44:45] don't want you to lay around watch tv
[44:47] all the time
[44:50] i want you to to do something
[44:52] constructive when i come home i want to
[44:54] be very happy
[44:57] with you occupying or you be wasting
[44:59] your time
[45:01] are you with me you follow the example
[45:03] what i'm saying here
[45:05] so what jesus is really saying he says
[45:07] trade your time trade your gifts trade
[45:09] your talents trade your money with the
[45:12] purpose of bringing god an increase
[45:18] it's not about us
[45:19] it's not about us showing off what we
[45:21] got from god
[45:23] it's about
[45:24] bringing something back to god that he
[45:27] didn't have before he gave it to us
[45:30] he's looking for something more
[45:33] amen
[45:35] otherwise we're at ease in zion that's
[45:37] true verse 15 and it came to pass that
[45:40] when he was returned having received the
[45:42] kingdom then he commanded notice he
[45:45] commanded
[45:46] he commanded these servants to be called
[45:49] for accountability unto him to whom he
[45:51] had given the money and that he might
[45:54] know how much every man had gained
[45:57] by
[45:59] trading
[46:01] think about that anybody that's
[46:04] involved
[46:05] in the stock market
[46:08] had the idea of putting money in there
[46:10] hoping to get something greater in
[46:12] return and most of the stories we hear
[46:15] about are those that put all this money
[46:17] into bitcoin and they lost everything
[46:20] right we hear a lot of those stories now
[46:22] we see a lot of those stories now
[46:25] nobody is going to ever put money into
[46:27] something hoping they don't get nothing
[46:29] out of it
[46:31] so god never gives you a gift hoping to
[46:33] get nothing out of it right it's true
[46:35] right amen he never gave you a lifetime
[46:38] for you to take that life and not get
[46:40] nothing out of it
[46:43] because if we think like that we're at
[46:44] ease in zion
[46:49] we see god's mind and his purpose here
[46:51] for all of our lives he wants us to take
[46:53] whatever he has given us and bring again
[46:56] back to his kingdom
[47:00] now we're not taking anything with us to
[47:02] heaven outside of one
[47:04] our character
[47:06] and two
[47:07] who we brought in to jesus
[47:12] and we're talking about the kingdom of
[47:14] god
[47:15] he is not interested in my money
[47:19] amen
[47:20] he's not interested
[47:22] in any kind of
[47:24] thing that i can muster up and entertain
[47:27] and like i'm not bringing that
[47:30] i'm not bringing anything i've collected
[47:32] bought
[47:34] worked for
[47:35] i'm not bringing it to heaven enough
[47:37] bringing it to the kingdom amen
[47:39] so we must be talking about something
[47:41] his kingdom is invisible
[47:44] right it doesn't come with observation
[47:45] you don't even see it so if we're going
[47:47] to give something back to that kingdom
[47:50] right amen
[47:54] yes my character has to be there i can't
[47:56] enter in i got to have perfect love
[47:59] but it's not about me
[48:03] he didn't give us what we got just for
[48:05] us if we did the word would never spread
[48:08] so we we've got to take what we've got
[48:11] with the mindset of getting
[48:13] to increase god's kingdom amen
[48:16] verse 16 then came the first saying lord
[48:20] thy pound have gained 10 pounds he was
[48:23] working
[48:25] he was working
[48:27] and he said unto them
[48:29] well thou ha wow thou good servant
[48:31] because
[48:33] thou has been faithful
[48:35] with the little life i've given you
[48:40] have thou authority
[48:42] over ten cities so notice
[48:45] the reward
[48:47] came according
[48:48] to the works
[48:50] this is important
[48:52] down here we're all given different
[48:54] gifts
[48:56] we can't do nothing about it there's
[48:58] nothing there i'm telling you there is
[48:59] no way that i could be
[49:02] a um a donny reagan
[49:05] there's no way i could play
[49:07] uh guitar
[49:09] alike
[49:11] whoever's a good guitar player
[49:15] i can only do what i can do because
[49:16] that's all god made me
[49:20] but the thing is my reward comes from my
[49:23] labors
[49:24] not if i had something more to labor
[49:26] with
[49:27] you understand i'm saying
[49:31] and it's not how talented you are
[49:35] but it's how you use your talent
[49:39] you can use it five minutes a week
[49:41] you can use it five hours a week you can
[49:43] use it five days a week
[49:46] you can give yourself to god
[49:48] and get a a big return
[49:51] or
[49:52] you can not that's you that choice is
[49:54] yours and what's so beautiful about this
[49:56] is
[49:58] you know it's all free more agency but
[50:00] the people that got a false
[50:03] understanding about
[50:07] eternal security and where they're at
[50:09] with god
[50:10] could be a lot more at ease thinking
[50:12] that they're going to get more out of it
[50:13] than they really do
[50:18] and the second came saying lord thy
[50:20] pound have gained five pounds
[50:23] and he said unto him he said likewise to
[50:25] him be
[50:27] thou also over five cities so again
[50:30] being rewarded
[50:32] for what he brought
[50:34] to the kingdom
[50:37] and another came saying lord behold
[50:40] here is thy pound what an insult can you
[50:43] imagine
[50:45] bringing making somebody some something
[50:48] to eat or
[50:50] giving us some candy and a week later
[50:52] they just give it back to you
[50:55] right you know what i mean
[50:57] that that just
[50:58] like
[51:00] lord you weren't worthy of me trying any
[51:02] harder than this
[51:04] lord behold here is thy pound which i
[51:08] have kept laid up in the napkin
[51:12] that was not the right thing to say
[51:15] nor do
[51:18] lord behold here is thy pound which i
[51:20] have laid up in a napkin i say woe unto
[51:23] you that are
[51:24] at ease in zion amen
[51:27] because that's what this is a picture of
[51:29] to me
[51:31] and now he begins to to pour out his
[51:33] excuses for being lazy
[51:37] being at ease not working not trading to
[51:40] get gain for his master he says for i
[51:43] feared thee
[51:45] i feared thee
[51:47] how can you fear the one that gave you
[51:49] the gift
[51:52] i feared thee it wasn't because of the
[51:54] gift
[51:57] but his expectation
[51:59] because thou art an austere man
[52:04] which means
[52:05] strict in manner and attitude harsh
[52:08] having no comforts or luxuries god don't
[52:11] want us too comfortable
[52:13] in zion
[52:15] he wants us with the fear of god
[52:19] i could be wrong lord what else would
[52:21] you have me to do
[52:24] when it comes to god's judgment
[52:28] god is not describing himself here as a
[52:32] loving god full of grace
[52:34] no sir
[52:36] remember in the book of revelations
[52:38] brother brahm talking about him on
[52:41] judgment his hair was white as woe
[52:44] he's there to bring judgment and here
[52:47] he's looking for the accountability of
[52:49] his servants there's no love and grace
[52:51] at this point
[52:53] the love and grace that they had was all
[52:56] their life
[52:58] that's when they had the grace of god
[52:59] that's when god showed the love
[53:02] he gave them a a period of time a space
[53:05] of time and that was their grace and
[53:08] that love
[53:09] but there will come a time for all of us
[53:11] to give accountability of our time
[53:18] he says for
[53:19] i feared thee verse 21 because thou art
[53:22] ulsterous an austere man thou take us up
[53:24] where thou last not down and rapists
[53:27] where thou did us not so man that sounds
[53:30] so unfair of god
[53:34] i mean when we see somebody
[53:37] trying to take credit for something we
[53:38] did
[53:40] you know we think that's not right
[53:44] that's not right
[53:46] but in reality
[53:48] he's the potter we're the clay he can
[53:51] expect anything he wants out of us
[53:54] and he's always right
[53:58] and he sayeth unto them
[54:00] out of thine own mouth will i judge you
[54:05] and he says you're a wicked servant
[54:07] think about that now he didn't take his
[54:10] his talent
[54:12] and
[54:14] go use it on the devil
[54:16] right he didn't
[54:18] turn into an elvis presley or a beatles
[54:23] he just
[54:24] didn't use his gift for the lord
[54:30] and he was called a wicked servant for
[54:32] it thou knew us that i was an austere
[54:35] man taken up that i laid not down and
[54:38] raping that i did not sow
[54:42] wherefore
[54:43] he's asked this question then gave us
[54:46] not thou
[54:47] my money my talent that i gave to you
[54:51] that at my coming
[54:53] into the bank that at my coming i
[54:56] i might have required my own with a
[54:59] little bit
[55:01] that's what you do when you put your
[55:02] money in the bank these days you don't
[55:04] get much interest but we used to get
[55:06] more interest
[55:09] he would get something if you would
[55:11] place yourself
[55:14] and come under subjection to somebody
[55:17] who you will let them use you to use
[55:20] your gift to get something accomplished
[55:22] for the kingdom but i'll say it's
[55:24] nothing compared to how god can use you
[55:27] because you're only at church so long
[55:30] but you've got your whole life to live
[55:32] for god amen you got the times that
[55:34] you're not here to be given yourself and
[55:36] be winning souls for god amen but if you
[55:39] just did it here at church at least it
[55:41] could be used to get a little something
[55:51] he was too scared to go out
[55:55] trade his time
[55:57] to gain a soul for god's kingdom
[56:06] he'd rather be at ease and zion we've
[56:08] all dealt with this we've all felt you
[56:10] know what i just as soon stay home from
[56:12] church
[56:14] i just assume
[56:17] you know what it
[56:19] ah somebody else can do it
[56:24] it's not the attitude that you're having
[56:26] at the church friends it's not the
[56:28] attitude that you're having towards
[56:29] somebody else you want to take care of
[56:30] that situation for you or whoever you
[56:33] feel only
[56:35] maybe it's just the missionaries that
[56:37] are safe souls i don't know how you
[56:39] think but you have a life
[56:43] you have gifts that god gave you you
[56:45] have talents
[56:47] you have a desire to be in
[56:49] zion
[56:51] but you can't be there at ease
[56:54] woe unto them that are at ease
[56:56] so it's not just being in zion being in
[56:58] god's presence in joy no you've got to
[57:00] get to a place where you let god use you
[57:04] are you with me
[57:06] all right and he said unto them that
[57:08] stood by take from him that pound and
[57:10] give it to him that had ten pounds
[57:12] whoa
[57:14] and he said unto him lord
[57:16] he has already got ten pounds
[57:20] for i say unto you that unto every one
[57:23] which have shall be given and from him
[57:25] that have not
[57:27] even that he have
[57:30] shall be taken away from him
[57:32] but those my enemies which would not
[57:34] that i should reign over them bring
[57:37] hither and slay them before me
[57:41] god
[57:43] woe unto them now notice these
[57:47] that wouldn't allow god to use them
[57:51] a lot regularly
[57:55] they didn't get in trouble to the end
[57:58] so all along they didn't think they were
[57:59] going to get in trouble
[58:01] now after the first day when he left and
[58:03] came back he said you know what
[58:06] this is going to happen but he didn't do
[58:08] that right he doesn't do that to any of
[58:10] us he just says have given your life
[58:12] occupy
[58:14] go go occupy
[58:16] and remember the gift didn't come from
[58:18] satan
[58:19] we were in our at our men's meeting we
[58:21] were talking about the
[58:23] the the things that uh
[58:25] come down to our generations that we got
[58:28] to deal with sometimes
[58:31] god is the only one that gives us gifts
[58:33] and times the gift of life
[58:36] so we we have to return back to him
[58:39] so we we we deal with making this
[58:41] decision every day
[58:43] am i just going to do my thing
[58:45] as long as i'm not doing bad it should
[58:46] be okay are we going to be wise
[58:48] redeem the time
[58:50] you know that's our choice
[58:52] this man was unwise
[58:55] the first two were wise this man was
[58:57] unwise
[58:59] balaam was unwise lot was unwise
[59:03] it's unwise just to to believe it in a
[59:06] doctrine a predestination if it's only
[59:09] head knowledge because head knowledge is
[59:11] not going to get you back up working for
[59:13] the lord
[59:14] that's right but a true revelation from
[59:17] god on predestination will get you back
[59:19] up working for the lord where if you've
[59:20] got a head knowledge you're just going
[59:21] to get back up and do your own thing
[59:26] all right remain vigilant
[59:28] amen
[59:30] we're winding down second corinthians
[59:32] chapter six verse one
[59:34] it's time for us
[59:36] to go out amen
[59:38] to get uncomfortable a little bit god
[59:40] don't want us too comfortable in zion i
[59:43] know it sounds like an oxymoron but it's
[59:45] really really not
[59:47] it's a paradox is what it is god wants
[59:50] us comfortable right but he doesn't want
[59:52] us to comfortable
[59:55] there's a balance all right we then as
[59:58] workers together with him we're working
[1:00:01] with jesus
[1:00:02] beseech you also that ye receive not the
[1:00:05] grace of god in vain
[1:00:09] in other words keep working for he saith
[1:00:11] i have heard
[1:00:13] thee in a time accepted in the day of
[1:00:15] salvation have i suckered thee behold
[1:00:17] now is the acceptable time behold now is
[1:00:19] the day of salvation
[1:00:22] this now you may be saved
[1:00:24] you may be saved and you are saved you
[1:00:27] come out you're in
[1:00:29] the message of the hour you're in zion
[1:00:33] but we need to work together because
[1:00:35] this is still the day of salvation for
[1:00:37] somebody
[1:00:40] right so you give no offense in anything
[1:00:47] i i a lot of times
[1:00:49] when we're trying to accomplish
[1:00:50] something and we're not getting what we
[1:00:52] want
[1:00:53] very easy
[1:00:55] we can go on the offense
[1:00:57] try a little pressure try a little
[1:00:59] manipulation try a little this and that
[1:01:01] and i'm not going to talk to you and
[1:01:02] this and that and try to
[1:01:05] accomplish what you want
[1:01:07] but what happens in the long run
[1:01:09] is the ministry
[1:01:11] gets blamed you get blamed for doing
[1:01:13] that you shouldn't done that you
[1:01:15] shouldn't have you shouldn't talk to me
[1:01:17] that way
[1:01:18] you could have handled it different i
[1:01:19] didn't i understood that what you were
[1:01:21] saying was right but it's the way that
[1:01:22] you said it that offended me
[1:01:25] you understand what he's saying here
[1:01:26] giving no offense and anything that the
[1:01:28] ministry be not blamed
[1:01:31] this is you you all got a ministry
[1:01:33] but in all things you're proving
[1:01:35] ourselves as the ministers of god now
[1:01:37] how do we do it not just saying we're
[1:01:39] right but you do it in patience
[1:01:43] you're you're willing to take some
[1:01:45] affliction
[1:01:47] you're willing to feel the necessity of
[1:01:49] being approved in distresses
[1:01:52] this is how you approve yourself i'll
[1:01:55] say paul was not a man at ease in zion
[1:01:59] amen
[1:02:02] paul was about the father's business
[1:02:04] amen
[1:02:05] in stripes
[1:02:07] imprisonments and turmoils and laborers
[1:02:09] and watches and fastings now we do some
[1:02:11] of those but some of those might be just
[1:02:13] you know people talking behind our back
[1:02:17] people giving us the cold shoulder
[1:02:22] i think the more we
[1:02:24] we we labor for the lord the more the
[1:02:26] devil hates you
[1:02:29] right you got to have thick stand thick
[1:02:31] skin and the devil will use somebody to
[1:02:34] get at you
[1:02:36] in stripes imprisonments and turmoils
[1:02:38] and labors and watchings and fastings by
[1:02:39] pureness
[1:02:41] it doesn't matter you say pure by
[1:02:44] knowledge by long suffering by kindness
[1:02:46] by the holy ghost by love unfeigned by
[1:02:49] the word of truth by the power of god by
[1:02:50] the arm of righteousness on the right
[1:02:52] hand and on the left
[1:02:55] this is how you go win a soul
[1:02:58] praise the lord
[1:03:00] you love jesus
[1:03:02] that's amazing to me how many people are
[1:03:04] walking around today without a vision
[1:03:06] about occupying right
[1:03:08] now
[1:03:11] second corinthians chapter five verse
[1:03:13] nine too many are at ease in zion
[1:03:17] remember jesus said
[1:03:19] we don't know what hour he's coming but
[1:03:21] be ready
[1:03:22] watch be ready
[1:03:24] and i'll say one so
[1:03:26] if we knew jesus was coming
[1:03:29] in in 2023
[1:03:31] let's say that
[1:03:34] we would obviously start doing more than
[1:03:36] we're doing
[1:03:38] right
[1:03:38] our lives would all change a little bit
[1:03:40] if we really really knew
[1:03:44] but what do we have to present to him
[1:03:46] when he asks us
[1:03:49] what did you do with the time that i've
[1:03:51] given you the talents i've given you
[1:03:56] so it really doesn't matter if we know
[1:03:58] when he's coming right what really
[1:04:00] really matters is that we're faithful to
[1:04:02] do what he wants us to do and he comes
[1:04:04] whenever he wants to come
[1:04:07] okay second corinthians 5 9 wherefore we
[1:04:10] labor wherefore we labor that we that
[1:04:13] whether we're present
[1:04:15] or absent
[1:04:17] we may be accepted
[1:04:20] that we may be accepted of him
[1:04:23] so whether we're dead
[1:04:27] or whether we're alive
[1:04:30] whether we're with you
[1:04:32] not with you this state that state
[1:04:35] we labor
[1:04:37] and why do we labor
[1:04:39] that we may be accepted of him because
[1:04:41] we just heard the parable
[1:04:43] if we don't want to labor we want to
[1:04:45] just take our our life and wrap it up
[1:04:47] with ourselves and be at ease
[1:04:50] we're not going to be accepted he says
[1:04:52] for we must also appear before the
[1:04:54] judgment seat of christ
[1:04:55] that every one may receive of the things
[1:04:57] done in his body according the way i've
[1:04:59] done whether it be good or bad
[1:05:01] knowing therefore this is really how god
[1:05:04] is
[1:05:05] and also austere man
[1:05:08] knowing therefore the terror of the lord
[1:05:11] we get busy we go to work
[1:05:13] we persuade men
[1:05:18] because i want to be accepted
[1:05:21] i can't just say well i did all this but
[1:05:23] nobody came i don't believe that
[1:05:26] i don't believe that
[1:05:27] right
[1:05:28] god will give you the fruits of labor
[1:05:35] we need to remain vigilant
[1:05:38] last scripture
[1:05:39] first corinthians 15 58
[1:05:43] therefore my beloved brethren be
[1:05:45] steadfast unmovable always abounding in
[1:05:48] the work of the lord for as much as you
[1:05:50] know that your labor is not in vain in
[1:05:53] the lord
[1:05:54] praise the lord
[1:05:57] now
[1:05:59] that parable that jesus gave
[1:06:02] and they got 10 more pounds
[1:06:04] i wonder has anybody ever tried
[1:06:06] investing in something
[1:06:08] and it didn't work
[1:06:12] okay
[1:06:13] i have i've been i've invested
[1:06:16] more than i want to tell you
[1:06:20] how many's ever tried
[1:06:22] so
[1:06:23] you didn't get that pound for the lord
[1:06:25] that's the thing i want to say there
[1:06:27] now how about
[1:06:28] tried really sharing jesus with somebody
[1:06:30] but they just said
[1:06:32] after all the time that you spent
[1:06:33] they're just no thank you
[1:06:36] so i would imagine those ones that
[1:06:38] brought ten pounds and those that
[1:06:39] brought five pounds that they really
[1:06:41] tried a lot more
[1:06:44] right so paul said i became all things
[1:06:46] to all men that i might win some
[1:06:48] but woe unto them that are at ease
[1:06:51] in zion
[1:06:52] we don't want to be that that group and
[1:06:55] it's an individual affair
[1:06:57] it's an individual affair but i i'll
[1:07:00] just say it like this
[1:07:04] let's help one another
[1:07:06] get going
[1:07:08] share some testimonies
[1:07:10] and promote one another to good works
[1:07:14] how many pounds you got for our our
[1:07:16] master
[1:07:17] we're going to be seeing them very soon
[1:07:19] you know let's try to try to do this
[1:07:21] because this is not something
[1:07:23] that is talked about a lot
[1:07:25] right this is not the the mainstream of
[1:07:28] of of of things but yet it's something
[1:07:31] that all of us are going to have to give
[1:07:32] an account for so it's important to god
[1:07:36] amen let's stand together
[1:07:57] to think
[1:07:59] that here is the place in zion that god
[1:08:02] speaks he dwells he lives
[1:08:05] it's the hiding place it's where god is
[1:08:07] at
[1:08:08] and that we could be right there at ease
[1:08:12] what a paradox
[1:08:16] and he's just saying
[1:08:19] don't leave
[1:08:21] don't leave zion
[1:08:24] just don't get too comfortable
[1:08:28] think serious
[1:08:29] about
[1:08:31] your responsibility
[1:08:33] and let
[1:08:35] let's let's get something for the king
[1:08:39] i just think it's beautiful he our god
[1:08:42] is not a lazy guy
[1:08:44] just one is just kind of
[1:08:47] floating around
[1:08:49] he doesn't want that
[1:08:52] he
[1:08:54] every one of us if we gave our our
[1:08:56] children i don't care if it's
[1:08:59] a hundred dollars a thousand dollars a
[1:09:01] hundred thousand dollars
[1:09:02] we would want them
[1:09:04] to use it wisely
[1:09:08] right
[1:09:09] and if you you sent
[1:09:11] one to the store you wouldn't want them
[1:09:13] coming
[1:09:15] 50 bucks coming back with 50 bucks of
[1:09:17] candy
[1:09:18] you know you'd want them to use it right
[1:09:20] so it's just god wanting us
[1:09:22] to use our time it really belongs to him
[1:09:26] you use it for him
[1:09:28] amen
[1:09:30] all right let's
[1:09:32] let's sing um burn burn holy spirit burn
[1:09:35] in me
