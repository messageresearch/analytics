TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] amen amen Heaven and Earth will pass away this thing will stand the test amen praise the Lord so this evening i' just like to start out with just a little quote well now we want to speak as every meeting about Jesus Christ and he's the center of our worship the center of our attraction the center of our life all that we have and want and are and will be is based upon him he was the one who came and gave his life for us came down from God out of glory and was made flesh and dwelt Among Us and taken Upon Us upon him the sin of us all the sickness of us all bore it away to Calvary and there paid the price he's worthy of all praise that can be given him amen let's just SP our heads for a word of prayer dear Lord we're so thankful father Lord that you've set us on a solid rock Heavenly Father we just pray tonight as we gather together Lord that you will bless us with your presence and that you will just come and and that you'll speak to us you'll break the bread of life that you'll speak to each and every need father that's here every heart Lord may we go away father as those on the road to amasis that did not our hearts burn within us as he spoke to us Lord I pray that you just deal with us as Sons and Daughters may you just come and Be Our Guest Lord we love you in Jesus Christ's name we ask it amen amen no you can't be seated so I'm want to turn to Colossians chapter 2 for our opening scripture amen so want to speak on for just a little while I want to ask you a question What attracted you What attracted you to this message What attracted you out of all the things that you know we're in a the election cycle and everyone is bidding for your attention they want your attraction and but brother brandham said he said so he said we want to talk about Jesus Christ and he's the center of our worship he's the center of our our attraction he's the center of our life and all that we have and want and are and will be is based upon Him amen amen in Colossians chapter 2 starting with verse 6 it says and ye have therefore received Christ Jesus the Lord so walk ye in him rooted and built up in him and established in the faith as ye have been taught abouting therein with Thanksgiving beware lest any man spoil you through philosophy and vain deceit after the tradition of men after the runts of the world and not after Christ for in him dwelleth all the fullness of the godhead bodily and ye are complete in him which is the head of all principalities and Power amen you may be seated amen What attracted you what got your attention what what turned you to look towards God Amen because Paul here says when he's writing in the Corinthian Church he says so here you are you in verse six he says you therefore have received Christ Jesus the Lord so walk ye in him root in and built up in him and established in the faith as ye have been taught abounding therein with Thanksgiving in verse 8 he says beware lest any man spoil you through philosophy and vain deceit and your focus has left that which attracted your attention at the beginning in the original it says take care that no one make a prey of you to lead away as booty you know like a pirate steals something and he's he sees something valuable and that's the thing the devil sees something value if you are truly the elect of God then you have a value that the devil wants to get because the devil knows if he can get you then he can get to God if he can get you to fall then he knows I got God's attention and Paul said so take care that no one make a prey of you to lead you away as booty that is figuratively to seduce through philosophy or empty deceit which is delusions according to the tradition of men according to the elements of the world and not according to Christ so you see there in verse 10 it said well verse 9 says for in him dwelleth all the fullness of the godhead bodily and we know that but Paul told the Colossians he says you are complete in him so a government change isn't going to make a difference whether the economy goes up or goes down isn't going to make a difference because something has attracted me and my question is what is it that attracted you or have you been deceived and brought Away by delusional promises and devis fables oh if this could just happen or if this could be if this could be look at I am complete in him Amen in Revelations chapter 2 let's we just take a little bit here Amen in Revelations chapter 2 in verse one it says and unto the angel of the Church of Ephesus write these things saith he that holdeth the Seven Stars in his right hand who walketh in the midst of the seven golden candlesticks I Know Thy works and thy labor and thy patience God knows what you're already going through he knows all about the things that you've done and how that you cannot bear them which are evil he knows that he recognizes that and that thou has tried them which say they are Apostles and are not and has found them Liars we know all that so the angel the spirit of God in the Ephesian Church age was looking at the people and trying to encourage them and he said and you've born and you've has patience and for my name's sake has labored and has not fainted he says but even in in the midst of all of that and all the good things that you've done he says in verse four nevertheless I have somewhat against thee because thou Hast left thy First Love whatever it was that attracted you you got your go your eyes off of it whatever it was and you're the only one that can answer that I mean I've seen a lot of things in my life short Lifetime and I've seen people come and go and and you know some people they come in and they're like they like they're on fire and everything else and everything else and we just and after a while you watch them kind of cool down and everything and then next thing you know they're gone What attracted them What attracted them he says so he says nevertheless I have somewhat against thee because thou Hast left thy First Love remember therefore from when thou art Fallen what was it that attracted you what was it I mean God pre-ordained every footstep in my life every step every mistake everything he knew everything and when the time came that he came and when the fullness of time came and he called something attracted my attention and it's kept me amen he says because if you have lost the attraction if if the center of your focus has changed from the goal which is Jesus Christ if your vision is not on that you need to repent and do the first works or else I will come unto thee quickly and remove that Candlestick out of his place except thou repent back in 1954 brother Brennon was preaching in the seven Church ages and he did it all in one night it was kind of interesting he says what's the matter with this Tabernacle a man ought to be able to say when you meet a man and you say is your Christian experience when was it the dearest to you and you ought to be able to say right now that's what you should say well my best experience was back when I first got the baptism of the Holy Ghost when I come that was the best time I ever had brother Brenham said well brother you have fallen from Grace that's right amen amen because you left your first love showing that you had something in the beginning there was something that attracted Ed your attention you seized on it but then you set it aside you left it you left it brother mam says so it's not he that Beth but he that endureth to the end the same shall be saved not he all that saith Lord Lord but the one that doeth the will of my father oh let me just let that soak in just a few minutes when I was thinking about that scripture I was thinking about he came so far from glory to save a Wretch like Me There is something so precious in you that God himself would Veil himself in flesh and then when he went to the Garden of gethy after he had washed all their feet and he had broke bread with them and and fed them the wine and everything and and gave them all them wonderful words and they had had no idea what was going to happen the rest of that night they're all looking at each other and and and you know Jesus told them he say so somebody's going to betray me somebody's going to lose the mark they're going to walk away and and that was so out of their focus so out of their mind that each one each one Peter James John Timothy every one of them said is it I and when they got in the garden Jesus knowing the scriptures that had been written about him knew that he had to go in a place and completely lay down his life and accept what the scriptures said that was about to happen to him Peter he thought oh this this is I got I got the solution I got I figured it out I bought a sword today and if they come after you Lord I'm I'm going to I'm going to slice every one of them I'm GNA get them right down to the right size because they're not going to get you unless they kill me first and Jesus told him he said Peter he says you've lost your first you've the attraction see the attraction isn't you it's him am you aren't even sitting here of your own [Laughter] choice he attracted me and it hasn't let go yet praise the Lord amen amen he said Lord he says not the one that doeth or but the one that doeth the will of my father oh let that just soak in a few minutes he says I was talking fast tonight anyhow so let us let's just think about that for a few minutes he that doeth the will of my father he that endureth to the end he that endureth and to endure means to remain to Bear trials to have fortitude to persevere to abide to patiently suffer What attracted you because all these things are going to come your way and if you aren't attached to whatever attracted to you you'll leave if it's vain philosophy that got you in here it will take you out if it's some delusional idea of what you think Jesus Christ is you will leave amen Amen brother brandom in a message called Discerning the body of the Lord he said Paul promised now this quote I wrote down all the scriptures but brother brandom put all these scriptures together in one place Paul promised that in the last days by the holy spirit that the church would fall away millions of them and that's in 2 Thessalonians 2:3 he said they'll fall away but we think they'll fall away into the world when actually they're following away into a form of godliness amen he said for there will come a falling away for many will be heady high-minded lovers of pleasure more than lovers of God truth Breakers false accusers incontinent and despisers of those that are good and he's and brother Brandon because he's preaching Discerning the body of the Lord he says that is not the right discernment so he takes in this one little statement 2 Thessalonians 2:3 where he said there's going to be a fallen away then he say second Timothy 3 and then he takes 1 Corinthians 11 and he puts them all together to paint a picture what is the attraction I got to put a sign up in my front yard who I support and everything else what is the attraction if you are tied up in all these things of the world and what's going on over here or over there you know those people you there's one place where Jesus the disciples came to Jesus and they were talking to him and he said said do you think that when that Tower fell down and those guys died that it was they were greater Sinners than the rest of you do you think that those people in North Carolina were unbelievers that they weren't going to church somewhere maybe the Baptist maybe they were they were old-fashioned snake handlers I was accused of being a snake Handler once guy said I know who you are Bruce I said what's that he says you're one of them snake handlers I said yeah I said I'm going to bring them in tomorrow at work okay we'll handle some snakes you see those people didn't know Jesus said he said they built their Rock they built their house and he said when the floods came it swept them away the days back in Noah's time Jesus talked about in Matthew 24 he says they were eating and drinking and they were having a great time they thought they were safe up there oh look at what's going on down here in Florida oh I think I'm safe up here well we're going to read some more scriptures what is it that attracted you amen let's go to Second Timothy chapter 3 amen so second Timothy chapter 3 and this is a really familiar scripture brother John reads it a lot but the very first verse says this know that in the last days perilous times shall come so why are you even delusional to think that the changing of a government you're somehow going to be blessed why would you even believe that and then sit and argue with somebody else about who's which candidate they support or how this one's going to do this and that one's going to do that and there you are complete in Jesus Christ and him alone him alone Paul in this book which shall not fail said in the last days perilous times will come and Men shall be lovers of their own selves Covetous boolers I can fix it proud I'm the one blasphemers disobedient to parents unthankful Unholy without natural affection truce Breakers or they're going to shake your hand in the front and stab you in the back yeah false accusers incontinent Fierce despisers of those that are good traitors heady highminded lovers of pleasure more than lovers of God having a form of godliness but denying the power thereof from such turn away and we think the power is of laying on of hands or maybe speaking in tongues or seeing visions but the power that brother brandham talked about was the power of the Holy Ghost coming on you and turning you into a real Christian Amen brother ROM says well he says oh you say well that's a communist that's so-called Christians watch the next verse having a form of godliness but denying the power thereof they have no spiritual discernment because when you got spiritual discernment and the Holy Ghost is upon you you have spiritual discernment and it will say Amen to every promise of God but Paul said those days would be here and we got it it's here it's on us and we look and see it and we hear it from everywhere and US oldtimers us old gray-haired timers will tell you it is a lot different than what it was in the 80s this world is a lot different Don and I were talking about that we were driving home on Sunday I said you know I said it was a lot different before I got a phone stuck in my pocket and the promise of all the the knowledge of the world will be at your fingertips and every delusional lie and fr anything to change and and I'm telling you right now I am telling you right now so I was it team manager for 23 years and I remember when we first got the internet at our company and we had it tightly controlled we only had three or four different people getting it but then as it grew and we studied more people I would have problems people would mess up their computers and then they'd say well we don't know what happened and then I would go on the internet back then it was ask geves or there's there's been millions of Google's nothing there's they they had been around for forever and I'd and I'd say okay this is the problem with the computer I need to know what to do and I'd have 25 answers of what was wrong with that computer and now instead of me just saying hm maybe should just unplug it and plug it back in I got to go through 24 answers to see whether they're telling me the truth or whether they're lying to me because what vested interest do they have in my future the problem is is that when you get all carried away and forget what it is that attracted you you don't have the time or the brain that's big enough to find out who's telling you the the truth and who's lying Paul said take heed L you become a prey that somebody pulls you away amen amen Paul said those days would be here what do we do it ought to draw us together the Bible said assembling ourselves together and that the more when you see the day approaching and it ought to be one Revival after another and bonfires of God's glory built in every Church in every place well I can see he was talking about this is back in 1959 but we know now that we're not in that age anymore we're not in that time anymore because the world rejected Jesus Christ they put him out they put him out this this country is not going back to God Amen this country is going to some place that you are not going to like and it's probably not what I'm thinking a great coming together where all the churches with one heart one Accord assembling ourselves together and forget their man-made Theology and cry out to God for Spiritual power and spiritual discernment that's the hour that we need let's go to Second Peter chapter 3 praise the Lord second Peter chapter 3 so this is this is where brother brandham he took some of these scriptures also so is Peter is writing he says this Second Epistle beloved I now write unto you in both which I stir up your pure Minds by way of remembering remember what is it that attracted you what was the attraction that you may be mindful of The Words which were spoken before by the holy prophets and of the Commandment of us the apostles and the Lord and Savior knowing that first that there shall come in the last days scoffers walking after their own lust or their own desires a scoffer is a derider or a false teacher or a mocker and saying where is the promise of his coming for since the fathers fell asleep all things continue as they were from the beginning of the creation for this they willingly are ignorant that by the word of God the heavens were of old and the Earth was standing out of the water and in the water verse five Peter tells them there was a time when people did not respect what God had done Genesis 1:1 says in the beginning God created the heavens and the Earth and he created the Earth and when he was done everything that he did he said it is good the next it is good it is good and when he was done he rested and the Earth was in the water and out of the water amen but they were willingly ignorant of one thing whereby the world that then verse six says whereby the world that then was being overflowed with water perished they were willingly ignorant that they were not the pilot of their own ship God destroyed the world Noah not by his own choosing was saved what is it that attracted you but the heavens and the Earth which are now by the same word are kept in store reserved unto fire against the day of judgment and predition of ungodly men but beloved be not ignorant of this one thing that one day is with the Lord as a thousand years and a thousand years as one day and the Lord is not slack concerning his promise a politician could promise you the whole world and he's just one part of the team that's the way it is set up around here but some people seem to think that oh my guy he'll fix it they're willingly ignorant that God destroyed the Earth and that God already said the world's going to get destroyed again amen and the Lord is not slack concerning his promise as some men count slackness but his longsuffering to us word not willing that any should perish but that all should come to repentance Amen in the rapture message brother Brandon he says so now we see that the reason that this subject is so lightened at or the idea of a Rapture of a body change it's so lightened at is because that the prophet here has said that in the last days these scoffers would come saying these things see it's predicted the reason the people are acting today the way they're acting why you see certainly you should be expecting it because the Bible said that in the last day they're going to be heav high-minded lovers of pleasure more than lovers of God truth Breakers false accusers incontinent despisers of those that are good having a form of godliness and denying the power thereof from such turn away What attracted you or as your focus gone in another Direction because I already read in Colossians you are complete in Christ everything I have that beginning quote brother Brenham said he should be the center of our worship he should be the center of our attraction he should be the center of our life all that we have and want and are and all that we will become should be based on him and him alone amen amen praise the Lord denying the power thereof from such turn away this is still in a Rapture it's paragraph 33 and and I'm telling you what paragraph it is so that if you go what false accusers and Conant despisers of those that are good having a form of godliness and denying the power thereof from such turn away can we look for an impersonation of Truth an impersonation of truth and the prophet said certainly can What attracted you What attracted you I want you to take a look here at Deuteronomy Deuteronomy [Music] 11 praise the Lord amen in Deuteronomy 11 starting in verse 10 it says for the land where thou goest in to possess it is not as the land of Egypt from whence you came out where you s the seed and watered it with thy foot in the garden of herbs he's telling us that when we were back in the world we lived in Egypt and we did whatever we like the leaks and the onions and we did whatever the devil told us to do because we were slaves to Pharaoh but now we've come out because something has attracted our attention but when we were in that life in that world we we were the ones that planted the seed we are the ones that toiled the ground and and got the weeds pulled the weeds and everything else and watered the seed and watched it carefully watched it come up so that we could have fruit for our labors that's what we did back in Egypt everything was us everything was what I could get out of it because that's what we did back in Egypt verse 11 says says but the land where ye go to possess it is a land of Hills and Valleys and drinketh water of the rain of Heaven that's not in your control the land where you're going once you come out of Egypt and you go into the promised land it's a varied land it's beautiful it's got Hills and Valleys it's got ups and downs and it gets watered by the water of Heaven A Land which the Lord thy God carth for the eyes of the Lord thy God are always upon it from the beginning of the year even unto the end of the year when I came out of Egypt and came into the promised land god watched over that Land from the day of my new birth until the day he takes me home amen and it shall come to pass look at verse 13 He says and it shall come to pass if you shall leave your first love if you shall hearken diligently unto my Commandments which I command you this day to love the Lord your God and to serve him with all of your heart and with all of your soul whatever it was that got your attention at the beginning think about it cuz Moses tells them he says God requires you to serve him with all of your heart and with all of your soul that I will give you the reign of your land in its due season the first rain the latter rain that thou mayest Gather in thy corn and thy wine and thine oil God will provide everything that you have need of ye are complete in him what is your focus What attracted you and I will send grass in thy fields for thy cattle that thou mayest eat and be full take heed to yourselves that your heart be not deceived and you turn aside and serve other gods and worship them cuz God's brought you into a land of milk and honey God has brought you into a special place because I'm telling you this this message is not an appealing message Jesus Christ Isaiah said he had no beauty that we would desire him this message doesn't have desirable features but something caught my attention and it won't let me go it won't let me serve other gods it won't let me even though I see all these things happening it won't turn me away from who that is that attracted my attention amen because look at he says in verse 17 he says cuz if you start serving other gods well then the Lord's wrath will be kindled against you and he'll shut up the heaven that there'll be no rain and that the L the land yield not her fruit andless you perish quickly from off the good land which the lord giveth you and how's that happen when you lose the focus of what got your attention therefore therefore shall you lay up these my words in your heart and in your soul and bind them for a sign upon your hand that you may be as frontlets between your eyes don't ever forget heavens and earth will pass away but this word will never fail this word this God that that called me called you brought you out of the world brought you out of Egypt and brought you into this goodly land he watches over you am Jesus said he got there he cried he says oh Jerusalem Jerusalem he says I would have done so much for you but you're so stiff necked you think you got to have something to do about what your future is about when you are complete in me he says I would have come in and brooded over you like a mother as her chicks I would have been your buckler I would have been the one but he says now your day is passed amen amen you shall teach them your children speaking of them when thou sest in thine house and when thou west by the way when thou liest down and when thou risest up and thou shalt write them upon the doorposts of thine house and upon thy Gates and we've gotten so we've gotten so oh you know the uh hidic Jew I think that was called it's the Orthodox Jew he read all these scriptures because he was devoted to Moses so he made a little box and he'd put a little scroll in and he'd tie it around his head and he said there it is it's a frontlet before my eyes and then then he'd put the manora on the front door by the doorpost and when he goes every time in his house he touches the word of God God doesn't want you to do that he wants to come down and dwell inside of his people he wants to be a written epistle in you and not what you think it should be he will live through you he will send you the former rain and the latter rain in its season but you got to keep your focus on him what attracted you what was the attraction that your days might be multiplied and the days of your children in the land that the Lord swear unto your fathers to give them as the days of Heaven upon the Earth for if you shall diligently keep all these Commandments which I command you and to do them and to love the Lord your God to walk in all of his ways and to cleave unto him then will the Lord Drive out all these nations from before you some people they just have all kinds of problems because they're not looking in the right place they've lost their focus but when I'm complete in Christ he will take care of every trial every Temptation every sickness it will do it he will will do it he will take care of it amen every place wherein The Souls of your feet shall tread shall be yours from the Wilderness of Lebanon from this River from the river of Euphrates even under the uppermost sea shall be your coast and there shall no man be able to stand before you for the Lord your God shall lay the fear of you and the dread of you upon all the land that you shall read upon as Heath said unto you and I used to work with a machinist Avery I did a lot of things with Avery but you know I failed the biggest test I didn't testify to him about God but I'd go and work on his car and I'd just give him little things and everything one day he came to me he said Bruce he said you scare the Daylights out of me I said why is that Avery he says cuz I know he says I've seen you and he says I know he says if you start talking to me about God he says I'm going to get change my life and serve him that's not my testimony that was a testimony of a he Tite or a jebusite you see what attracted you what is it that you think this message is about what is it that you want out of God Amen amen amen praise God Amen let's see I got yes so verse 25 he says so no man shall be able to stand before you for the Lord your God shall lay the fear of you and the dread of you upon all the land that you shall tread upon as Heath said unto you what a TR you let's go to Exodus 23 so it seems like the promises of God are so yay and amen that well we shouldn't have any problems right we shouldn't have any we shouldn't have any failures we I I've given my heart to the Lord and and I'm serving him I'm serving him the best I know how I and and still things go wrong well I'm sure the next government will take care of it but that's what a lot of people believe what attracted you well I believe that the word of God has got an answer for every question concerning my life so you may not know about these scriptures in Exodus 23 I didn't I need to read more and you shall s this is verse 25 and you shall serve the Lord your God and he shall bless thy bread and thy water and I will take sickness away from the midst of thee and there shall be nothing cast and there shall nothing cast their young near be Barren in the land the number of thy days I will fulfill and I will send my fear before thee and I will destroy all the people to whom Thou shalt come and I will make all of thine enemies turn their backs unto thee and I will send Hornets before thee which should drive out the Hite and the Canaanite and the hites from before thee this sounds great I'll take it say Amen but the next verse he says I will not drive them out from before thee all at once I I'm going to do that I can but I'm not yes you could never have a cold you could never have a broken leg you could never have a tooth fall out yes you could be perfect health your whole life but I'm not going to do that lest your life the land becomes desolate if I was to if I if you were so if you never had a failure if you never made a mistake if you never lost your temper if you never fell down and got hurt if you never had a toach he said your life would be desolate remember what endureth endureth to the end means patiently endure Affliction that the land the the blessings of God came when Jesus was smitten at Calvary we couldn't partake of the Holy Ghost until he was with willing to die we could not take we could not enjoy the blessings of healing until the 30 Stripes were laid on his back because the scripture says by his stripes ye are healed the blessings of God comes with a singleness of eye on what it is that attracted you amen lest the land become desolate and the beasts of the field multiply against thee yeah now I see now I see what he was doing he wants to make me into an image that he'd be proud of by little and little I will drive them out br for thee until thou be increased and can inherit the land your faith will grow with every trial your gra Your Grace will grow your mercy on your fellow Believers Your Grace your love it will grow with every battle that you you win so what is it that attracted you you think oh my if I could just if if I could don't be drawn away by delusional promises or philosophies or the rudiments of this world because I am complete in Christ amen verse 31 says and I will set the bounds from the Red Sea even unto the Sea of the Philistines and from the desert under the river for I will deliver the inhabitants the land into your hand and thou shalt drive them out before thee so everything that you're having trouble overcoming the scripture right there said God's going to take care of it and he'll only take care of it if you serve him with your whole heart if you've lost the attraction or if the wrong thing if you came here and it was the wrong thing verse 32 says Thou shalt make no Covenant with them nor with their gods they shall not dwell in thy land lest they make thee sin against me for if thou serve their gods it will surely become a snare unto thee what attracted you in 1953 brother Brandon was preaching this message he says now look God said I'm not going to give it to you all at one time if I give it to you all at once if I do then the whole land will be swept bare and then the wild beasts will multiply against you and will overcome you I'm just going to give you it to you a little by little as you're able to possess the land I'm just going to drive them out and give it to you little by little amen amen praise the Lord let's look at Exodus 3 now that we see Exodus 3 verse one it says so Moses kept the flock of Jethro his father-in-law the priest of Midian and he led the flocks to the backside of the desert and he came to the Mountain of God even to Horeb and the angel of the Lord appeared unto him in a flame of fire out of the midst of the Bush and he looked it got his attention something attracted Moses and he looked and behold the bush burned with fire and the Bush was not consumed and Moses said I will now turn aside and see this great sight why the bush is not burn in 1954 brother bam said so you see Moses had been a bitter failure because he was in Egypt and just like it said there in the scriptures he watered his he planted the seed he watered the land he had it all figured out he his mama had told him he raised on his mama that that he was elect he was the he was the deliverer he planted he did all them things he was good at school he had a harvest he did again he went down he conquered in Ethiopia he was a great General he worked around he worked in and everything else but when he got into God's land that don't work no more and for him to go into the promised land God said Moses I can't use you like that so I'm just going to let you go on your own way till you fall flat on your face and he did and Moses had been a bitter failure but out there now we see his attention was attracted to a burning bush and he looks to the burning bush to find out what the trouble was maybe what you should be doing is going back to your first love and look at what attracted you and ask him for some answers instead of Googling it or seeing what Instagram or your Facebook feed or whatever he says his attention was attracted to a burning bush and he looks he looks to the burning bush to find out what the trouble was and as he was walking close to it fire usually brings an attention an attract rtion and usually the Holy Spirit when it comes in a manner of fire attracts the attention of people and when Moses turned aside to consider the Burning Tree that would not burn up God spoke to him in a fresh Vision By An Angel now watch Faith take hold right quick that word that promise to Abraham the those things that he had been taught by his mother were dead letters but when he met the burning bush the word of God went from dead letter to being alive and when it became alive Moses stepped right into the scriptures and acted out the mighty hand of God he couldn't do that because his attention was not on the right attraction brothers sisters come on what attracted you and what are you looking at now what is your focus watch Faith take hold right quick the old things are passed away but Moses now has a new vision he forgot all about his learning he forgot all about his victories he forgot all about Egypt every everything changed Moses Moses who was running from Pharaoh said okay I'm going to run back to Pharaoh that's Insanity because he had a new vision he had a revelation he had an experience he had met God he talked to God before that he had not met God he'd only read about God he only knowed what his mother had told him and by hearing what his mother had said or hearing what the pastor had said but now Moses has a personal experience What attracted you amen let's go here to Genesis 3 amen Genesis 3:1 it says so now the serpent was more subtle than any beast of the field which the Lord God had made and he said unto the woman y hath God said You shall not eat of every tree of the garden and I just wonder you know Eve I don't think she was a bad person because there was no bad in Eve because she came out of Adam and there was no sin in Adam but when she saw the beauty of his Timber and his colors and and we all know the scriptures you know and and how how beautiful he looked how could anything this beautiful with hope and love and everything how could it hurt me has not God said we can eat of every tree of the garden and the woman said unto the serpent we may eat of the fruit of the Trees of the garden but the word of God says the fruit of the tree which is in the midst of the garden God has said you should not eat of it neither shall you touch it lest you die her Focus was about to change and the serpent said unto the woman nah I'm going to make you a booty I'm going to draw you away by delusional promises vain philosophy I'm gonna I'm gonna there's you know there's a better way brother sister we just do this things are going to work out good if we just things will get better if we just for God does know that in the day that you eat thereof your eyes will be open and you should be God's knowing good and evil well who doesn't want to know that everything that comes across my phone I want to know whether it's good or evil what's wrong with that I want to know if this guy's lying or not what's wrong with that if it ain't in the word of God why are you even chasing it what is your focus and the Bible says and when the woman saw that the tree was good for food and it was pleasant to the eyes and the tree was to be desired to make one wise she took of the fruit thereof and she ate and she gave also unto her husband with her and he did eat and Satan's Eden brother brandham said but he won it fairily in Eve in the Garden of Eden by the lust of Eve for sin what the lust of Eve the Lust For Eve of sin then if Eve lusted for knowledge it was sin and in the uncertain sound brother brandham said so you see sin is attractive to get your attention sin is attractive to the human being because he's a subject of a fallen race that we are it's attractive Satan knows how to make it attractive he's a genius at his job and he and if he can't get you out there in the world affairs he'll bring it right into the church he comes right over on our own ground he gets on our own ground that's the reason brothers sisters we should recognize him it's time that the church was spiritual enough to recognize and know God not the Creed not the denomination but by experience being filled with the Holy Ghost amen look here at Second Corinthians 11 look at how Paul took it this in 2 Corinthians 11 he says would to God verse one he says would to God that you would bear with me a little in my Folly and indeed if you just listen to me for a little while he says because I'm jealous over you with a Godly jealously for I have espoused you to one husband then I presentent you as a Chase virgin to Christ I brought you out of Egypt I put you in the promised land and you're now you know when you were baptized the the water was a sign it it didn't wash away sin but it was a sign of a clear conscience towards God that you were no longer going into Egypt something had attracted your attention and you were going after that amen I've espoused you to one husband that I may present you as a Chase virgin to Christ but I fear lest by any means as the serpent beguiled Eve through his subtility or his cunning craftiness so your minds should be corrupted from the Simplicity that is in the Republicans or the Democrats the libertarian party maybe the United States Communist Party they didn't get my attention God got my attention and I've been espouse to him as a Chase virgin and yeah I fail but I've also found a promise where he said yeah it'll be okay he says but as you grow he says you will push them out and you will possess the land because I have prophesied it amen amen so I want to look at one more scripture Exodus 21 Exodus 21 and verse one it says now these are the judgments which Thou shalt set before them if you buy a Hebrew servant six years shall he serve and in the seventh he shall go out free for nothing if he came in by himself he shall go out by himself if he were married then his wife shall walk with him and if his masterath given him a wife and she hath borne him Sons and Daughters the wife and her children shall be her Masters and he shall go out by himself but if the M if the servant shall plainly say I love my master my wife my children and I will not go out free then the master shall bring him to the judge and he shall also bring him to the door behold I stand at the door and knock If any man open the door I will come in and S with him unto the doorpost and his master shall bore his ear through with an A and he shall serve him forever in the Jubilee Year brother Brandon preached this message in 1954 on October October 3rd 70 years ago but here's the tragedy if that man did not desire to go back and he wanted to remain there then the master walked him up to him and said you desire to still be my slave yes then he took him down to the temple told it before the people became a public testimony put his ear up against the post put an all and marked him in the ear and then he could never be free he had to be a servant as long as he lived he must continue to serve the slave driver as long as he lived if he willfully rejected his calling and his opportunity to be free now settle yourselves just a moment for the past 40 years in the United States of America this is 1954 has constantly been the Roaring forth of the Holy Spirit working among men and individuals giving signs and wonders all kinds of Miracles people that's been brought up from prostitutes from illegitimate people and so forth and they've been become gentlemen and Christians and there has been those who have been blind received their sight deaf ears have been opened the great time of Jubilee for the sick and The Afflicted those who have been bound by the devil in every regards whether they were were sick whether they were blind whether they were crippled there has been thousands times thousands of Miracles working amongst the people and there's been a Revival constantly going in the church for the past 40 Years of the baptism of the Holy Ghost and it's come to a time as a nation and whole and as an individuals and as Church groups we have turned it down we've walked away and rejected it 70 years ago brother Brenham said this country's not coming back to God in the bum of Gil gillad in 1961 he said that's what's the matter today all the nation goes into sin whiskey joints people getting cold formal uncensored radio program uncensored television programs it's so fascinating sin is so beautiful till it attracts the attention of the people and now they got computers and they got their phones and they got everything and it'll attract their attention amen because it's fascinating it's beautiful and if they're not truly born again where their attraction is on Christ and single-minded then they'll go after that stuff and then they'll act like those people and the spirit that's on that will finally get on them in 1965 in this day the scriptures fulfilled brother Brenham said what a perfect example it is of the Gospel of Jesus Christ when it's preached it's the acceptable time the time of the Jubilee anybody no matter who you are what color you are what denomination you belong to how far you've stooped and sin or what's wrong with you you can go free when you hear the gospel trumpet sound you are free but if you turn your back on the message and refuse to hear it notice you're bored in the ear with a awe that means to say that you have crossed the line between grace and judgment and you will never hear the gospel again you'll never get any further you must be a slave to the system that you're in the rest of your days if you refuse to hear the acceptable year and know it it not brother B said what is it it's through science you better memorize quote it's through science the food the hybrids it's perverted the whole human body till we become a bunch of mass of corruption and if the physical being is corrupted isn't your brain cell in your physical being watch the spirit following it there'll come a time in the name of the Lord that people will go completely insane the Bible said so they'll scream they'll holler great hideous things in their imaginary mind the radio and things our television programs they're all producing it I'm convinced majority of people believe zombies are real they're all looking for zombies to come and eat their brains and their brains have already been eaten really what is the attraction what is it that got you here and have you turned from it because the food is kill killing us then don't try to grow your own cuz that's going to kill you anyways cuz you ever think about it if every seed has been hybrid and hybrid and hybrid and hybrid where in the world you ever get a pure seed the only way you're going to get a pure seed and say dear God please bless this food because everything I eat even the water I drink I don't care if it came out of a plastic bottle you think it's it's came out of somebody's River somewhere brother it's all polluted I got a book at home will show you the the atomic ash from Nevada completely irrated the whole United States it's completely it's gone it's gone what is the attraction for you there'll be such things ants raise up on the earth that will be as high as 14 trees there'll be a bird fly across the Earth with wings four or five miles across people will see them they'll scream and holler and cry for Mercy but you see It'll be the plagues wait till I preach on those plagues amen What attracted you what's your attraction what do you want what is it you're looking for because I'm convinced I'm here to the end I ain't got nowhere else to go he Vindicated it to me he showed me he proved it to me I said yep amen let's bow our heads dear Lord Jesus we are thankful we're we're thankful that you know that we're flesh we're thankful Lord that you know that we have failures and we we fall but Lord our eye is focused on you our whole our whole life is focused you're the center of our life you're the center of everything all that we all that we are today and what we will become tomorrow and the next day it's all you it's all at your hand Lord I pray I pray you just take this simple message it's simple things burn it deep in our hearts Lord let us not be like the scripture says with a man beholding his face in a glass and he Combs his hair and turns around and walks out he right away he forgets what he looks like Lord let us not forget let us not forget what you've done for us Lord Jesus guide our footsteps guide us forgive us of our sins forgive us of our iniquities blessed is the man that God will not impute his iniquity to us and we are those people we're that people tonight you got our attention Lord may we keep our eyes focused on you focused on your word focused on what you're doing Lord I pray that you just we commit this service the books are closed the songs are over and after a little while the door will be closed we go home but Lord I pray you'll go with us and that you'll trouble the water in our lives ask us that question again what attracted you we love you in Jesus
