is here Jesus is here all things are possible Jesus is here Jesus is here Jesus is here all things are possible Jesus is here amen that your take a lot of pressure off of us amen and then it should also add a little pressure amen because we have to believe the word you may be seated for just a a few moments um before we get into the message uh brother my precious brother Mark has some uh important things to say and be we just he's intricate part of uh of us here and we just felt him and his position this would be a good time to to to share what he needs to share amen call florid made I am all your Amry here me my life [Applause] faithful and that goes a long ways um him stand up and saying well I'm here I'm the man I because of and he you know fill in the blank that could not be true unless he decided to be faithful and he's the man he is because he decided to believe the word and faithfulness is like number one with God I mean any anybody can run a a a Sprint and say wow wasn't that good didn't I just do that great for the Lord but get up day after day after day and keep following those bloody Footprints and so we appreciate brother Mark we appreciate God using him for the furtherance of the kingdom yes we're sad he's leaving but you know what this is different this is different because he's not going back out in the world he's going to go win souls we don't know what the Lord has for us us but we just have to be obedient to him and we support him and uh it wouldn't matter if he fell flat on his face he he knows we support him and that God is going to lead him no matter how many times he falls if a righteous man falls seven times seven times he'll get back up we're grateful for brother Mark and the The Man He's become the ministry that he has for the Souls that he's going to bless and yes it's going to be hard on us but we should rejoice in the fact that God is using him and sending him out because that's the way it should be it's really the way it should be um and we just will continue to pray for brother Mark and and as he's at about the father's business we need to be about the father's business here amen we're looking forward to him coming back and giving us good reports every now and then amen let's stand together for the reading of the word and we're going to read in the book of St Luke 18 believe it or not this scripture just came to me before the service we're going to spend some time in the Book of Luke today um we want to um remember brother Joel in prayer he would desire to be here he desires to be here if he could be here he would be here let's pray for him he's watching and but the brother Ferguson his family they're watching um also those that we don't know who's following the live stream let's remember to to pray for them uh I also want to make this announcement this Sunday we have a special uh guest speaker brother Moses Al alarz and he's from Brother mesic's Church and to gusap he's a deacon there and he's visiting some family and so he's near us and we're going to have brother Bill Sanchez and chirpe him for him um and uh we're just looking forward let's be in prayer for that service that's this Sunday amen amen before we begin reading here let's let's all just look to the author in a word of prayer Heavenly Father we're so glad that you're in our life you are our anchor our TI poost you you are the one that's going to see us through father we humbly bow before you today thanking you for this opportunity that we could come in this this sanctuary and worship you and lift you up in song and prayer and Thanksgiving Lord we're just beholding the testimony of a a young man who you called from the world and you've develops Lord him to this point in his life that he could be used Lord for your ministry for the kingdom of God and we're so grateful for the manifestation that you can work such a work in a man's life that you could change his desires Lord we're grateful and we're rejoicing with those that Rejoice today Father and father as we break in as we read your word and we break the bread I pray that you would unfold it as brother Ron said with Revelation the most important thing Lord give us all something that might help us draw closer to you today and God will give you the praise for it we love you we thank you now in Jesus Christ's name amen amen Luke chapter 18 we're going to start with verse number 18 and we've read this and heard this many time about the uh rich young ruler and a certain ruler asked him saying good Master what shall I do to inherit eternal life and Jesus said unto him why callest thou me good none is good save one that is God th thou knowest the Commandments do not commit adulter do not kill do not steal do not bear false witness under thy father and thy mother and he said all these have I kept from my youth up now when Jesus heard these things now when Jesus heard his response he said unto him yet lackest thou one thing sell all that thou has and distribute unto the poor and thou shalt have Treasures in Heaven and come and follow me and when he heard this he was very sorrowful for he was very rich and when Jesus saw that he was very sorrowful he said how hardly shall they that have riches enter into the kingdom of God Amen God bless you may be seated may may God just come and make this service of blessing for us today I I appreciate the service last Sunday amen amen if you haven't heard it listen to it if you did hear it listen to it again that's what I got to say it was a true it was a great blessing and I'll tell you I guess sometimes it's worth waiting to hear because we wanted our brother to come a little sooner but uh you could see his ministry is developing as well that's great blessing we want to entitle this today follow but from a distance and for a subject I just want to throw this out as a question to every one of us just how close have we been following Christ sometimes we can take our our foot off the gas as it were take our ores out of the waters brother brandom explained brother bman was talking in the men's meeting about Chuck Jager and how uh he was getting ready to to break through that sound barrier and just before he was getting ready to break through the plane really started shaking and if you never experienced this before it could be a scary thing man if I push the gas it's the plane's going to just blow up I'm going to die but he had a confidence that he was going in the right direction doing the right thing so he kept his foot down is the pedal to the metal as it were kept the gas going the throttle you know what I'm trying to say and it broke through the sound and it was just perfectly calm at that time amen and you know there's things that happen in every one of our lives that cause us uh to get distracted uh uh to question and and and there are times that we might feel like taking a backseat as it were and um uh not quit but really not be all in that's right and and so it's a really good question where are we how close have we been following Christ we take a look at this this Rich Young Ruler and he had been following the word the Bible says in keeping the Commandments but when his life crossed paths with more of the word coming to another church service and hearing more of the word he declined to take the word it was too much of a sacrifice so what did he do he decided to not follow Christ that close right because he had at stake he had his will which is the same thing we got we may not have money like he had but we have our will and God is always you know challenging us to draw closer to him there is nothing more than what he wants is to be close to his wife amen right yeah now we're living in the greatest hour of deception right it's dark there's a falling away there's trials it's the greatest shaking that's coming upon the the Earth people are leaving Christianity it's a great apostasy right and many of the people that are actually staying in church have taken a step back taken a backseat and decided to follow Christ but from a distance are you with me yes sir is this is this a can anybody relate to what I'm saying here now it's hard to find people today who are sold out who are on fire for God who are living for others who are hungering and thirsting for more of God to to worship to dig deep they it's hard to find something they can't wait till the doors are open right people have just begin to relax believers who once believed in a half hour prayer before service are happy if they just make it to church right and there are literally some who look for reasons so they don't have to go to church come on now now I'm not pointing fingers at anybody I don't know uh anything but I know the spirits that try to get on us that's right that's the truth believers who once walked close to the Lord have been satisfied with just following from a distance that's a it's not a good situation to be in I want to take a look at Peter we all know the story of Peter but turn with me if you we would in the Book of Luke chapter 22 now this is not a a sermon that's going to um make you feel all guy inside but this is we Brother s we do come to church find out where we're at with God and and look this is why we believe in a fivefold Ministry because we don't definitely don't want everybody like me right definitely don't want that yeah but God must have saw some purpose for me in the ministry there's got to be some purpose and and I just believe in trying to help us see things that maybe we don't always see to help us in our walk so let's start with verse 31 Luke 22:31 and the Lord said Simon Simon behold Satan have desired to have you that he may sift you like wheat we see Satan's motive for each one of us here today is to sift us like we he wants to possess us not to help us get what we want in life but to separate us and make us feel alone because that's what happens when you sift wheat right Charles Spurgeon said consider how precious a soul must be when both God and the devil are after it wow right Peter said be sober be vigilant because your adversary the Devils a Roy line walketh about seeking whom he may devour whom resist steadfast in the faith knowing that the same things that are happening to you are happening to your brother around the world true he wants to sift us like wheat so in order to remain sober and Vigilant and steadfast in a faith a Believer needs to be prayed up and to stay prayed up amen there's no other way am that's right amen look at verse 32 Jesus said but I have prayed for thee that thy faith fail not and when thou art converted strengthen thy Brethren prayer was the answer to keep in the faith alive amen and I'm so glad that Jesus prayed for you and I amen amen thank you Lord amen Jesus knew what was going to happen to Peter before it ever happened and the answer answer was prayer for his personal faith to stay the course I believe in the prayers of Jesus Amen I'm thankful for everybody's prayer here amen but I'm really really holding on to the prayer that Jesus had amen and this prayer gets us through until we get converted that prayer that Jesus prayed in St John 17 was that we would be one that prayer was there until we become one amen now after we get converted we should no longer be living for ourselves right amen that's the truth amen it's quite easy nowadays to think that we've been converted it is it's easy you just all you got to do is think it and you are right but Jesus said search the scriptures they are the ones that testify what a true conversion really is when you converted you're actually living for others and it's not something you just do once in a while you do some random acts you have a different nature and you live for others without a respect to persons brother John God has used me in so many ways I have so many testimonies I understand I know we've heard them Peter had testimonies too he walked on the water he had Crusades with Jesus he walked he talked he traveled he saw miracles happen right and Jesus was his teacher right but he wasn't converted amen Jesus had given them power over against unclean spirits to cast them out and to heal all manner of sicknesses and all manner of diseases but the bottom line is Peter was not converted right so how far will you go before you just like lay back and say you know what I don't feel like trying Peter wasn't a new creature yet old things were still hanging on him he still had his pride his reputation right he still had all things figured out in his life how things were going to be granted some things had changed in his life but all things had not become new and the Bible says when a man is converted All Things become new right all things are of God who have reconciled us to himself by Jesus Christ and have given unto us the ministry of reconciliation so at this time Peter had not been converted and Jesus was telling them a four time when you do get conversion when the conversion actually happens I know you're following me I I know I've given you power but when the conversion happens and you receive the power of the Holy Ghost where it's actually doing the witnessing all the time 24/7 365 days of the year amen then you're going to strengthen the Brethren yes to it that God was in Christ reconciling the world to himself not imputing the trespasses on them and have committed unto us the word of reconciliation am now then we are ambassadors for Christ there it is we're living for others as though God did beseech You by us we pray you in Christ said be reconciled to God Amen so when you're converted over to God he leads you and puts you in a position to convert all others amen that's what happens when you get converted yes sir when you get filled with the Holy Ghost now you're on the same you have the same purpose God has to see others converted to see others strengthened come on am when Jesus told Peter when thou art converted strengthen thy Brethren he wasn't meaning Pat them on the back and say you can make it no sir that's not what he meant the word strengthen means to turn resolutely in a certain direction to fix to establish to set fast resolutely is a purposeful determined unwavering manner that's what type of Christian the Holy Ghost makes you and and that's when God is working in you it's not about trying to help somebody that day and make him feel a little bit good help them get through the day I'm sorry that is not what Jesus meant he meant get them to the Holy Ghost get them converted amen get them to get filled with the holy spirit because it's the only thing that's going to withstand the devil in this age we no longer live as ambassadors for our own wants our own desires our own needs right we are now ambassadors for The Souls of other people amen so we take this ministry that God has given us and we lead others to become one with Christ to become an ambassador did didn't Paul tell Timothy that you need to be able to teach men that will be able to teach others also amen yes sir if you keep it going MH it's it's too easy to take a back seat and say well I'm in that's you know I'm set well okay you're set so you think but I'll tell you what you get a dose of the Holy Ghost that'll get you off that back seat too many people are relying on God using them as the determination for their conversion did not GE did not Jesus say many will come to me in that day and say Lord Lord have we not prophesied in thy name and in thy name cast out devils in thy name did many wonderful works and then will I profess unto them I never knew you depart from me ye workers of iniquity and Brother Band told us that iniquity was not doing the right things that we should be doing yes right than not making time out of our busy schedule to reconcile others to Christ is Iniquity amen that's right and we think well that's an optional thing you know if you get time you just fit it in that's what I'm saying if if if you're converted we need to be living the word we need to be manifesting this amen if you've been converted just lend your body over to the Lord we must remember that we're not our own amen well we know how important it is to remember right right amen remember you're not your own you're bought with a price amen and that price is God's blood amen Paul told the Corinthian Church he says and that he died for all that they which live should not henceforth live unto them right but unto him which died for them and rose again and he told the Roman Church Romans he said the church in Rome therefore we are debtors not to the flesh to live after the flesh so we see here that we've got to analyze are we really walking real close to the Lord or are we walking from afar yeah we're following but how close are we brother random said in the message that day in Calvary talking about what happens after your conversion he said then what does it do it gives you after the that condition his Spirit to follow him and to do as he did for others who is following on he was just one man the perfect man he gave his life and he made an example for you now you must do it now the first thing I want to say is Jesus never lived for himself his life was spent for others that's perfectly eternal life he said amen when you say you go to church and you do good things that's fine but when you live to yourself you haven't eternal life now that's a strong statement I could never make that statement but I can read it amen I can read it and I can say Amen to it you know CU people want to live forsel and claim that they're close enough to God that they got eternal life because of they repented they got baptized they served God for a season they never want to come to grips that that Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever amen and if you're struggling then you ought to be putting everything you got to get more of the Holy Ghost there just is not going to be any excuse on the day of judgment brother BR said eternal life is living for others it proved it when it come to the Lamb of God see he lived and he had eternal life because he did not live for himself he lived for others and you receive eternal life by receiving that day and you don't live for yourself no more you live for others now listen this this may be something while I just want to get through this and you know I just get on this is not real encouraging but we need to get serious about where we're at you know we ought to be booming with inviting people to church amen that's the truth we ought to be booming with sharing the true Holy Ghost with others amen someone said still on the same quote here but someone said how can you stand and let anybody call you such bad names and brother Brandon says you don't live for yourself you live for others that you might redeem that man you become sons and the trouble of it is the church has forgotten they were Sons right you're a son you're taking Christ's place you're a son so you don't live for yourself you live for others in other words if somebody does you harm somebody says something bad you get all bothered and huff puffed about about it because you forgotten you're a son and daughter of God because if you're a son and daughter of God you want that stuff to happen so you can show the love of God to that person amen sir how else is Christ going to be manifested that's right amen anybody can be good to those that are good to them right anybody can hang out with friends who like them right but try getting on a bad side and it's not even your fault you love them anyways that's Christ to me that's eternal life being manifested am Amen brother brand says well he says well brother brandom I can live for this brother because he sure is a nice man brother Bram said that's not it live for the man who hates you live for the person who would kill you if they could that's what they done to him they killed him and he died that he might save them that's eternal life when that's in your bosom your face in heaven then you sacrifice your own things and give them up like the sheep gives up its woe you look on towards calary isn't that a beautiful quote I'll tell you this is what teaches me what real how how close I am to God yes sir it's true because there's a lot of didn't there's a lot of people thinking that they're saved when they're not brother bam said even after the Rapture happens people will be coming up to the altar given their heart they think but it'll be too late thinking they got saved and they're not even saved so we can't go by how we feel about things we got to get dig into this message dig into the word what does the word say and then say is my life lining up with that right because that's all that matters and I'm so glad that God sent a message amen yes sir Amen in the message faith in the Son of God brother B says so each day I want to live not for myself if I live for myself I live a selfish life I want to live for others and give what strength I have not to myself and to my own pleasure but for the benefit of others that they'll build now notice this that they'll build the kingdom of God because I mean you can just give your life to marchad dimes and so many different things out there but it won't build the kingdom of God the the the whole purpose is to see others become what Christ wants them to become amen if we've been converted then we need to start reconciling others to Christ well brother John I just don't got time I don't got this I don't got that I I don't feel ready I I'm just not there I say don't ignore this Holy Ghost leadership amen don't we're going to see in the scriptures that Peter had a chance to reconcile some people and he decided not to he thought I'm just going to follow Christ I'm going to continue to follow Christ but it's going to be from a distance I tell you he lost his burden for Souls his trial consumed him he was so consumed with his own problems all right so Jesus told Peter I have prayed for thee that thy faith fail not when thou are converted strengthen thy brother verse 33 and Peter said unto the Lord unto him Jes Lord I am ready I am ready to go with you both into prison and you know if that ain't enough into death and as brother brettman said in the men's meeting Jesus knows all things and he said I tell thee Peter the shall not crawl this day before Thou shalt Thrice deny that thou knowest me my now that was what the word that was preached now can you imagine sitting in service and having something preached and you thinking no I don't believe it yeah you can relate to what Peter was saying that's why that the no wonder the angel like that song only believe I'd rather believe what the word is saying regardless of how I feel amen because the word is always right amen too often we get in arguments with the word our carnality says one thing and the word says another and I'm going to tell you what the word is my safety the word can't be wrong my feelings my emotions my ideas what I my my how I perceive things that all can get messed up and confused but the word is the anchor we have something steadfast and it's for our soul and if brother B he says eternal life is living for others why are we spending so much time Liv for ourself it's like we want to like tear that out of the message you can't that's your Vindication amen amen I love the word I love this messag amen verse 39 and he came out and went and he was and and he was want to the Mount of Olives and his disciples also followed him and when he was at that place he said unto them now notice this is the next thing that needs to happen pray that you enter not into temptation so this is what I want to say about Temptation temptation is coming no matter if you like it or not it's coming amen true prayer keeps you from just entering into the thing that's what prayer does prayer makes you sober makes you watch okay I see what's happening I'll stay on guard right just thinking oh I got this handled I no temptation's coming and it's going to take you unaware so you know Jesus is just telling him a four time telling them what he needs to do to prepare and he still isn't getting it when you look back at all the times you backsliding it's because you weren't really prayed up true verse 41 and he was withdrawn from them about a stone cast and kneeled down and prayed saying father if thou be willing remove this cup from me nevertheless not my will but thy will be done amen I think it's okay to ask God for something that you got a good idea that ain't his will just be real sincere and mean it not my will thy will be done you know God understands we're frail we're human but this is what prayer is all about look what happened after he prayed here in verse 43 and there appeared an angel unto him from Heaven doing what strengthening him amen strengthening him right in prayer and he's being honest with himself I've got this need I got this problem God it let me byass what I got to go through not my will thy will be done and he said the the right thing amen God will reward a Believer with strength if they're willing to stay there in prayer they that wait upon the Lord shall renew their strength am now just praying wasn't good enough Jesus had a job to do and praying to satisfy the requirements of prayer wasn't good enough in other words prayer gets you to the place that you can overcome it doesn't take the Temptation away right you're not going to get up and I pray today I'm going to have a great day that's not it you may have have that same bad day if you wouldn't have prayed but now you're going to be able to overcome amen amen how many times have you got up you started your day and you know that you didn't spend either time in prayer or enough time in prayer and you're going through the course of the day and it comes to your mind you know you should have prayed first you know you should have got serious stayed there longer in prayer it that's just the Holy Ghost amen because the trial is still coming but you're not spiritually strong to deal with it verse 44 and being in agony he prayed more earnestly and his sweat was as it were great drops of blood falling down to the ground God's will for our life is not a bull of cheeries or some comfortable entertainment God's will will cause Agony in our lives the closer you follow the lord the harder it will be on your flesh in the men's meeting we're talking about God knows our our afflictions and our sicknesses and how hard it is for us at times and he cares about us he wants us to cast our cares upon Him and I made this statement I said God wanted us to go through sickness to be in pain to hurt so he could show what a God of comfort he is because without us going through the trial he would never be out of there to save the day and so this is God's got everything under control we don't have to worry about what the world's going on we know he has everything under control verse 45 and when he arose up from prayer and was come to his disciples he found them sleeping for sorrow and he said unto them why sleep ye rise and pray lest you enter into temptation so here's the signal again I don't feel like praying I'm a little back I God knows what I'm going through and I don't feel like trying you know what that God is not acceptable right if you don't want to crucify by your flesh don't expect God to come in on the scene amen that's right men ought always to pray and not faint okay now Jesus is betrayed by one of his follow verse 47 while he yet spake Behold a multitude and he that was called Judas one of the 12 went before them and Drew near and and G unto Jesus to kiss him and Jes Jesus said unto him Judas betray us thou the son of man with a kiss you know the way that he said that you just know that Jesus had such love for Judas amen still loved him you know to me we would have went out the other door we would have started talking negative about them we would have I mean when bad things happening their doors are wide open for opportunities to show the love of God Amen yes sir amen why you never have to be afraid never if God is with you who could be against you am and I'll say it like this if the love of God is in your heart what can take you away from loving that person amen yes sir nothing because God's love is the strongest power on the earth now my love is so puny it can't even hardly get up but we don't even want to talk about our love we don't want to talk about how whose love is greater we just want God's love it's it's the greatest it'll pass the test and when they which were about him saw what would follow they said unto him Lord will we Smite with the sword and one of them this the uh smol the servant of the high priest and cut off his right ear and from what I understand that was Peter because he's proving that he's willing to be all in right but the only thing is he wasn't all in love right amen he was all in for fighting right but he wasn't all in for love we're set at the defense of the Gospel not the offense amen that's what you see the difference there and one of them smoke the Ser of the high priest cut off his right ear and Jesus answered and said suffer ye thus I want you to remember those four four words suffer ye thus far suffer and he picked up the ear or touched his ear and healed him in the middle of the chaos in the middle of fear in the middle of unknown the middle of betral the the middle of unfairness Jesus tells Peter suffer what are we want to do when we're in a trial this is so wrong this is not right we're going to yell our head off we're going to say everything we need to hear the voice of Jesus suffering amen you either believe Jesus is with you or you don't I'm telling you if he said I'll never leave you I'll never forsake you you got to believe it your feelings are going to tell you different then Jesus said unto the chief priests and the captains of the temple and the elders which were come to him be ye come out as against a thief with swords and St what what's going on what are you doing you don't take my life I give it amen when I was daily with you in the temple you stretch forth No Hands against me but this is your hour and the power of Darkness je Jesus clearly identifies what's happening but you know what he doesn't try to change the outcome he committed himself to the father he didn't go on there and try to manipulate people and things look I'll tell you this word gives me a road map of what I need to do it teaches me how to live this is not some story something we we watch on television this is a reality for the believer filled with the Holy Ghost verse 54 then took they him and led him him and brought him into the high priest's house and Peter followed a far off now this is the whole message right here this is what started it and Peter followed a far off so he's still following Christ but he's kind of taking a backseat not all in not all out just kind of from a distance at one point Peter's test testimony was that he was going to follow Jesus all the way and he would even be willing to die and something happened in his walk this trial came into Peter's life and he didn't understand it he didn't want to accept it but he he decided he make a clear-cut decision in himself that he was not going to walk as close to the Lord still going to come to church still going to believe but just not going to be as close I'll just sit in the back and I'll watch from a distance I'll just come into church but I'll slip in slip out real quick come on Hey listen you know I'm not being negative this is a positive thing right I think if we just say Amen we'll get the devil off our back amen that's right we can say that Peter Still followed the Lord but his life proved that it was from a distance the life proves is from a distance it's no no longer well you don't know what's in my heart brother I don't need to know what's in your heart all I got to do is listen to things you say watch the life that you live and I'll know what's going on that's right what they say if you want to know how somebody takes care of a car look to see how how the car looks on the inside you want to know how somebody is find out what they're listening to what they're doing what they're feeding on Peter had lost his trust for the word he lost his trust for the word something happened that made him doubt and it was the trial of suffering which makes us most of us withdraw and stop doing the word is something we have to suffer with too often Believers can become like Peter who have it all figured out in his mind because that's how Peter was he had it figured out in his mind this is what's going to happen let's get the story let's get nobody's going to take us because we're with Jesus the Messiah but no the way that Peter had it figured out wasn't the way that it was because God's thoughts are higher but to often we can think we got things figured out how things are going to go how it's supposed to work out this is what's going to happen and then when things don't go as planned they reside to just following Jesus from a distance following the ministry from a distance following the word of God from a distance taking a back seat no need to be on fire I'm not cold I'm not cold in God but I'm not hot either that place that God hates we don't even realize it it's not a matter if you're cold it's a matter if don't be lukewarm don't follow God from a distance get away from the spirit that just doesn't make you want to press in right how close are we following are we falling close enough to hear that still Small Voice when we need to have answers I don't think God wants us to go through life without knowing what we should be doing I don't think so God is not the author of confusion but sometimes we just don't want to pay the price I mean what happens when you don't got time to make a meal what happens you resort to microwave Ramen noodles maybe going through a drive-thru picking up some fast food so what happens when we don't got enough time to spend with God In Prayer we just resort to well this is what I think are we falling close enough to suffer for the will of God in other words when we're going through a problem we can murmur and complain manipulate yell get the sword out start cutting people with words or we can believe that God's still with this he's got this situation under control I'm just going to trust him that he's going to put on my heart what to do right now because it proves God on the inside amen are we following close enough to reconcile others think about it you got a burden for souls are you falling close enough to have a burden for Souls how about to Bear the approach of Christ these are good questions amen now look verse 55 and when they had kindled a fire in the midst of the hall and were sat down together Peter sat down among them he was just going to have some fellowship get warm but a certain maid beheld him as he sat by the fire and earnestly looked upon him and said this man was also with him and he denied him he denied him saying woman I know him not now notice still following but from a distance and after a little while another saw him and said Thou Art also of them and Peter said man I am not and about the space of one hour after another confidently affirms saying of a truth this fellow also was with him for he is a gilean and Peter said man I know not what thou sayest and immediately while he yet spake the crew and the Lord turned and looked upon Peter and Peter remembered the words of the Lord how he had said unto him be before the Crow Thou shalt deny me Thrice and Peter went out and wept bitterly he had regrets happening right in front of them the problem with our carnal flesh is that when the word says one thing we'll sit there and deny it yes instead of just saying Lord that's your word I need to line up to it there's a difference between humility and pride and look Saints I don't care how close you are to God and I don't care how far you're away from God what needs to happen is we we need to get closer amen amen because the devil has a tendency of just constantly making that Gap bigger and bigger and bigger and I tell you Church tendons don't do it that's right Church tendons does not do it what does it is when you start believing the word that you hear amen now the word warned Peter to stay prayed up for Spiritual strength pray that you enter not into temptation and right in the middle of the trial the word told told Peter to suffer but the Temptation was too great I don't want to suffer I'm not going to do this I'm not going to let this happen either I'm GNA fight or I'm leaving you ever see something like that they'll fight or they'll leave they don't know how to they don't know how to love enough to believe that God is going to work out the situation now this has nothing to do with brother Mark because brother Mark has absolutely no issues with this church what we believe his wonderful [Laughter] pastor but you know what I'm saying when there's a problem there is no problem here brother Mark is being called that's not a problem that's a victory amen he just wants to be obedient to that and I I I could have tried you know you know put him in a headlock and say buddy you ain't going anywhere but I would just be trying to do that to the holy ghost that ain't right no I believe God has everything under control amen now Peter just couldn't walk away because he knew that Jesus had the words of eternal life so he resided to just following Jesus from afar and I want to ask you the question today if you could would truly take time to answer how close are you how close are you walking to him he got away from his complete commitment his full commitment he he became reluctant how many times you walk into church reluctant come on right how many times you get down in prayer and you just you feel reluctant in your prayer right true you're to pray in faith so we got to really be honest about this question I believe God wants us to have a closer walk with him amen amen but we've got to be honest with oursel and say yes I I know that I'm not walking where I need to be walking all right Luke chapter 9 verse 21 Peter could have gone through the same task in the same trial and been like this a Man Standing On Solid Ground I shall not be moved amen I mean Jesus wasn't moved in fact in the middle of his great trial he decides to take time to have a healing service heal somebody and they're going to take him away right he was so focused on doing the will of the Lord here he wants the cup taken away from him and this is the the initiation as it were of of of of being betrayed with a kiss and 30 pieces of silver and they're going to take him he knows everything that's going on and he doesn't call any of it out he just he ask questions why why didn't you get me before I mean what are you doing here I haven't he takes time to help somebody in the middle of his trial how often do you see somebody try to help somebody in the middle middle of their trial they're so consumed with their trial they don't got time to help anybody well I'm telling you the Holy Ghost isn't like that amen I want to be so possessed of God that others is really number one am now I can't make that happen but the Holy Ghost can amen amen and if I believe it oh if I believe it we're we're not I'm going to read these scriptures real quick I'm not going about get everything cuz I want to get to the end all right Luke 9: 211 and he straightly charged them and commanded them to tell no man that thing saying the son of man must suffer many things and be rejected the elders and the chief priests and the scribes and be slained and be raised the third day so here he had the word it was given to him when he went to church the word was given to him he knew was going to happen one place he said you know this ain't going to be you're you're you're not going to suffer I'm not going to let it happen and he said look you're going to have to suffer too that's what he said amen and so what does he say here and he said unto them all if any man will come after me let him deny himself take up his cross and daily and follow me so are we following from a distance or are we denying oursel are we taking up his will his will which is his will is for us to live for others and in order to do that we have to suffer because we don't get our will right it's it's that simple the pain is there for whosoever will save his life you know what I'm just going to do what I want to do is going to lose it but whosoever will lose his life for my sake the same shall save it for what advantage is a man if he gain the whole world lose himself or be a Castaway we have to go on and get more of the Holy Ghost we have to stop following Jesus from a distance we have to it's time for us to draw nigh to God set our affections on things above it's the Bible says it's high time for us to wake out of our Slumber our sleep press in press in we need to the goal is to manifest Christ we got to manifest him I wouldn't stop seeking God until you're satisfied with how much you're manifesting Christ we get too satisfied with I'm saved I'm in the I'm in the message I'm going in the Rapture but the life is trying to get somebody else in it's living for others it's not doing good deeds it's living for other people's Souls yes Lord help us instead of protecting our matcho spirituality that's what we usually do we need to Humble ourselves and admit we need more of him we need more of the Holy Ghost we need to manifest more of God on the inside of our Lives instead of complaining about things let's just manifest his will he may want you to suffer in the middle of your trial so others can see Christ manifested why would you give that up John said for this purpose the Son of God was manifested that he might destroy the works of the devil I'll tell you what when you're in the heat of a battle a heat of a battle with somebody if you just manifest the word the word says a soft answer turns away wrath amen but you know if you just want to I gotta prove you know they're wrong and you're going to stir up The Strife so manifest the word not prove who's right wrong we don't want to prove who's right or wrong Christ he's the only thing that's right he's the only one that's good and when you know it just works to our favor when we yield oursel to him all right now you got to believe that you're part of him you're a seed of God Amen and another words every seed brings forth of its kind you've got to manifest what Christ did look after Peter went and got the Holy Ghost he never denied Christ anymore and he told him you you stay there until you be endued with power from on high and you'll be Witnesses for me you'll know how to witness right now you only know how to witness when you know this guy's a nice guy that person's nice I get along you know we kind of see eye to eye but you stay away from the person that hates you you won't you just how strong long is your love how how much Holy Ghost do you got what are you afraid of Amen Don't Be Afraid God hasn't given us a spirit of fear but Power love and a sound mind now Jesus said If you deny me I'll deny you if you're ashamed of me I'll be ashamed of you yes and Peter did deny Jesus but I'll say it like this Peter went on to get the Holy Ghost God knew that that's the only reason he got denied was because he didn't have the Holy Ghost but what he once he got the Holy Ghost he said I don't care what you do to me I'm not gonna obey man I'm gonna obey God and I don't care you know brother Brian says I don't care if I got to preach to empty pews eat soda crackers and drink blanch water I'd rather do that than compromise with the truth because that's what the Holy Ghost does to a man it makes him stay with the word oh I love the word all right now we got to hurry because time is short now I don't know how much time um I think you know brother Mark was up here for you know maybe 15 20 minutes I can't remember so I got a little extra time turn with me First Peter chapter 2 I just got one encouraging scripture right after this and then we'll quit okay so it's not long are you getting something out of it all right 1 Peter chapter 2 ver 18 servants be subject to your own masters with all fear not not only to the good and the gentle but also to the forward for this is thankworthy if a man for conscious towards God endure grief suffering wrongfully now that's what Jesus asked Peter to do suffer he had a hard time with it but Jesus did it and I'll tell you unless you get the Holy Ghost you just can't do it all the time for what glory is it if when you be buffeted for your faults you shall take it patiently but if when you do well you do the right thing you didn't do anything wrong and you suffer for it you take patiently this is acceptable with God you know we don't we just kind of like want to rip that out we don't want to think about it you we don't to hold ourselves accountable to that we just kind of want to like live our life and you know what I'll say this do you know how it must make God feel if you only want to take part of this word for your life the part that you you want the part that encourages you the the part that makes you happy the part that makes you prosperous but the part but the other part you don't want to do do you know how that makes him feel that you only love a part of God God wants us to become like him every seed's going to bring forth of his kind we've got to fall in love with the word that we don't like all right now look at this verse verse 21 for even here unto were you called amen you were called because Christ also suffered for us leaving us an example that we should follow his steps yes it's true Peter out of all people is telling us this the one who didn't follow his steps but after he got the Holy Ghost he had no problem taking those steps there's the difference the Holy Ghost is the difference it isn't your strength your ability how much God uses you how much you know about the Bible the Mysteries none of that matters what matters is are you humble enough to seek the Holy Ghost because we got to get sealed with it right now notice it said who did no sin neither was guile found in his mouth that this is this is the example that he left that we got to do we got to follow we got to have no gu in our mouth who when he was reviled reviled not again and when he suffered he didn't threaten back but he committed himself to him that judgeth righteously who his own self bear our sins in his own body on the tree now I just want to stop there we've been called to be ambassadors we've got to Bear the weak the the strong bear the infirmities the weak we have to bear we have to get our hands dirty we have to be willing to take on problems in people's lives because we're called to be ambassadors to really Point them to a life not just say well uh here's the cross but to have what it takes to get them to the Holy Ghost amen that's what a holy ghost filled believer does all right Psalms 91 then we're going to quit with this Psalms 91 so this is Sister Show's favorite Psalms we're going to read this right now and let because it's her favorite song that's not why we're reading it but I want you to think about this God is calling us to a closer walk what could be any closer than dwelling with him dwell with him dwell with him not from a distance but with him Psalms 91 he that dwelleth in the secret place of the most high shall abide under the shadow of the almighty amen now this doesn't happen by mistake this just doesn't happen because my name is John Martin and I go to send the light I'm sorry if that's all I had to do woo that'd be easy right but it takes denying your flesh picking up your cross and following him it's what it takes you just can't do what you want to do get in prayer and hope to be in that place God May bless you for a season but if you want to dwell there it's going to take a sacrif you have to live not unto yourself anymore but to live unto God Amen I will say of the Lord he is my refuge and my Fortress my God in him will I trust amen let's Stand Together may God grant us that that place so close to his heart that we hear him say how much he loves our enemy and we try to help them I believe if Jesus would stand here today that would be the character of him and he's the same he's not going to change we're the ones that need to change we're the ones that need to come into that full conversion until we're like and don't stop don't take the foot off the the pedal until you you are in his imageen don't be satisfied with just making the church church amen let's sing must Jesus bear the cross alone must Jesus bear the cross alone and all the world go [Music] free no there's a CR for everyone and there's a cross for me the consecrated cross how bear Till Death Shall Set Me [Music] Free and then go home my crown to well for there's a crown for me upon the crystal pavement down at Jesus p is Fe with joy I'll cast my golden cist and his dear name repeat oh preious cross oh glorious Crown oh Resurrection de ye angels from the stars come down and bear my Soul amen let's sing that first verse again must Jesus bear the cross alone and all the world go free no there's a cross for everyone and there's a cross for me [Music] amen amen Jesus said there was one we believe there's one the question is are we really really really picking it up are we carrying it or are we calling the cross the trials that come into our life is they not the same the people in the world that don't even serve God they got tons of Trials you you listen long enough they'll tell you about them but it's not the cross cross is God's Will and it goes against your flesh just like it went against Jesus's flesh amen amen let's take a moment just bow our heads we'll go to the Lord in prayer I wonder if there'd be anyone here today that say brother John would you remember me today in prayer man God sees your hands amen amen let's just believe now with our heart Heavenly Father we thank you thank you that you've made it possible that no matter what distance we are from you there's always a closer walk with you and Lord we thank you that you have given us such an easy word to believe you didn't make it hard you just said draw a nine unto God and he'll draw a nine to you you want us to take the first step Lord you see these Saints they've raised their hands they want to draw nigh to you they're taking that that step forward Lord and Desiring to be closer to you than they ever have and knowing when the Rapture takes place Lord we remember your Prophet saying God would not take anyone until they're as close as they could be and your bride is still here and Lord there's still a closer walk for them and when that Rapture takes place they're going to be as close as they could possibly be to you because you said your Prophet said not take us until we're as close as we can be so Lord you have us here for a reason and father we want to submit our life unto you Lord we want to commit our life to you that no matter what things happen we want to believe that you're with us in the middle of our trials we don't want to be testifying that things are are chaotic and and and out out of sync we want to be testifying that you're in control because you living inside of us Lord father I pray that you take our lives and begin to manifest more eternal life help us to give us a deeper revelation of living for others what it entitles and how it fits into our life and Lord may we always be abounding in the work of the Lord knowing that our labor is not in vain bless each hand Bess bless each heart bless each mind may they leave here with a confidence Lord that you are going to draw nigh to them because they have they are drawing I to you we thank you for these things we give you the praise for all of them Lord in Jesus wonderful name
