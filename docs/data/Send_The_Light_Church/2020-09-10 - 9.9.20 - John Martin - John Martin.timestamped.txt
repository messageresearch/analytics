[0:56] we want to just continue praying
[1:00] how the enemy would like to use us and

[1:16] to really appreciate
[1:18] times that we do have to gather together
[1:20] we know it's

[2:31] that you meet with us
[2:32] here lord in a very special way in the
[2:34] way of the revealing of your word to us

[2:45] service to you and ask your blessings
[2:47] on the reading of the word now in jesus
[2:49] precious
[2:50] amen amen first john chapter 1
[2:55] starting with verse number one that
[2:58] which
[2:59] was from the beginning which we have
[3:02] heard which we have seen
[3:06] with our eyes which we have looked upon
[3:08] with our hands
[3:09] and handled of the word of life
[3:13] for the life was manifested and we have
[3:16] seen it
[3:16] and bear witness and show unto you
[3:19] eternal life which was with the father
[3:23] and was manifested into us that which we
[3:26] have
[3:27] seen and heard declare we unto you
[3:31] that ye also may have fellowship with us
[3:33] and truly our fellowship is with the
[3:34] father
[3:35] and with the son jesus christ and these
[3:37] things right we unto you that your joy
[3:40] may be full god bless you may be seated
[3:46] um well
[3:49] brother marty did a
[3:53] a marvelous men's meeting and laid a
[3:56] good foundation for the service tonight
[4:00] he talked about living for others and
[4:03] loving others
[4:05] and he made a statement he says there's
[4:08] always
[4:09] a manifestation and i want us to to
[4:13] focus on that tonight we can see this in
[4:16] in our opening scriptures here we want
[4:18] to entitle this message show and tell
[4:22] and for a subject showing others eternal
[4:24] life
[4:25] john here speaking that we've we've seen
[4:30] with our eyes we've handled with our
[4:32] hands
[4:34] the word of life and it the life was
[4:37] manifested we've seen it we bear witness
[4:40] and now john is saying we show unto
[4:44] you eternal life
[4:47] actually showing something that's
[4:50] invisible
[4:53] which was with the father and was
[4:55] manifested in us
[4:56] that which we have seen and heard now we
[4:59] declare it on to you notice
[5:02] the manifestation you show it and then
[5:05] you declare it
[5:06] or you announce it the reason that you
[5:08] do this or that we do this as christians
[5:11] is that the people that we're talking to
[5:13] can actually have fellowship with us
[5:16] that they can go to heaven amen and that
[5:20] they may receive joy in their heart
[5:22] that's what john
[5:23] is saying here now many of us remember
[5:27] as young children in school we used to
[5:31] have what's called
[5:32] show-and-tell it was a special day we
[5:35] look forward to it
[5:38] show and tell was a time that we could
[5:40] uh actually
[5:41] learn more about others uh what their
[5:44] favorite uh
[5:45] uh thing was and they would they would
[5:48] talk about it and
[5:49] and often they would bring in maybe a
[5:52] favorite toy a stuffed animal or
[5:54] or a uh a car or something like that
[5:57] and maybe they would bring a game or
[5:59] they would show a magic trick
[6:01] or maybe bring a baseball that they got
[6:04] autographed to a game they went to
[6:07] uh maybe some artifact from a trip they
[6:09] went on or they showed a picture of them
[6:11] standing by the grand canyon they would
[6:13] they would talk about it sometimes they
[6:15] would bring in a live pet
[6:18] a dog a cat a guinea pig or a bunny
[6:22] and sometimes uh friends would bring in
[6:25] a favorite snack talk about the snack
[6:28] and share it with everybody
[6:30] and it was an exciting time
[6:34] and the thing that everyone looked
[6:36] forward to was
[6:37] actually seeing what they brought in
[6:42] that kind of like grabbed their
[6:43] attention
[6:46] the show always comes before the towel
[6:50] this show was what made your friends
[6:52] eyes get bigger
[6:56] and put a smile on their face
[6:59] and then after we seen it
[7:03] we wanted to hear all about it
[7:07] we wanted to hear more about it tell me
[7:09] about it
[7:10] you sleep with that where did you get
[7:13] that
[7:14] that was from the civil war you got that
[7:16] for your birthday i mean
[7:18] then the excitement came about
[7:21] everything that they were saying
[7:23] what grabs your attention comes to your
[7:25] eyes
[7:26] and then your ears want to hear all
[7:28] about it and it's really no different
[7:30] when you're sharing the gospel of jesus
[7:33] christ
[7:37] brother
[7:40] brother branham said in the mark of the
[7:43] beast he says the gate of your soul
[7:46] is our eyes it was always disappointing
[7:50] when someone
[7:52] came it was their turn to do the show
[7:54] and tell
[7:55] and they didn't bring anything did
[7:56] everybody remember
[7:58] seeing that experiencing that and i'll
[8:00] tell you that was always disappointing
[8:03] it was just it was it wasn't as
[8:04] interesting it was it was more boring
[8:08] and even children want to see a
[8:11] demonstration
[8:14] they want to see it and not just hear
[8:17] about it
[8:22] it's important so what is the attraction
[8:26] i was never attracted to someone who
[8:28] just wanted to talk about the gospel
[8:32] whose faith didn't follow
[8:35] it was a life that i saw personally
[8:38] demonstrated
[8:39] to me that got my attention i seen
[8:42] something i
[8:43] never seen anywhere else
[8:48] and our goal should want to be to live a
[8:51] life
[8:52] that nobody has seen before
[8:55] which takes a lot of work it takes a lot
[8:57] of effort
[8:58] it takes a lot of trying how can i
[9:02] live in this situation differently than
[9:04] the person i'm with that has
[9:06] never seen it before
[9:11] when you seen that person demonstrating
[9:16] got your attention it made you want to
[9:18] look deeper into the situation
[9:21] and then learn about it where did you
[9:23] learn to live like that
[9:24] what nicodemus say about jesus we know
[9:27] that thou art man of god no man can do
[9:29] these things
[9:29] except he be of god then he wanted to
[9:32] hear more
[9:36] by this show and tell
[9:39] by this demonstration shall all men know
[9:42] you're my disciples
[9:48] when you demonstrate loving others the
[9:50] same way
[9:51] that i have loved you god bless you
[9:54] sister we
[9:55] we will at the end okay just that we can
[9:57] keep the cotton
[9:58] continuity going but we definitely want
[10:00] to hear from you
[10:01] jesus never said by this talk shall all
[10:05] men
[10:05] know
[10:10] it's a demonstration of love
[10:14] you can't talk love
[10:17] it has to be demonstrated love is a verb
[10:20] it's alive
[10:24] no greater show-and-tell
[10:27] no greater demonstration than this than
[10:29] a man
[10:30] lay down his life for his friends so
[10:32] here jesus
[10:33] is saying this is how you show the world
[10:36] you lay down your life for the need
[10:42] don't tell somebody what they need to do
[10:46] the the greatest love that can be shown
[10:51] is when you give up all that you are
[10:55] to help a soul get where they need to
[10:57] get to
[11:01] demonstrate it and then tell them all
[11:05] about the love that changed your nature
[11:10] that made you so willingly eagerly to
[11:14] lay down your life
[11:17] because if you just you just go around
[11:19] you talk to everybody everybody's into
[11:21] themself
[11:24] it's all about what they do what they've
[11:26] done what they're going to do
[11:30] and if they're talking about others it's
[11:31] usually something negative
[11:35] it's the same thing there you either
[11:36] build yourself up or you cut somebody
[11:38] else down to make you
[11:40] it's all about you and when you see
[11:42] someone that's
[11:43] generally interested in somebody else's
[11:46] soul now this is important we talked
[11:49] about this in our men
[11:50] we can't be interested just in
[11:53] the shirt they're wearing
[11:56] the tie they're wearing the car they're
[11:59] driving
[12:00] the natural needs it has to be about
[12:04] something to do with changing their
[12:07] nature
[12:07] that's what the soul is the nature has
[12:11] to be changed when you
[12:15] i i i love brother marty for
[12:18] so many reasons i can't count them
[12:23] and brother barney is just he's always
[12:26] he's always teaching and helping and i
[12:28] just love him but
[12:30] he was always trying to instruct
[12:33] our girls to make sure they they checked
[12:35] their tire pressure in their cars
[12:38] before they leave make sure everything
[12:41] is right
[12:42] and i just think man he's doing a better
[12:44] job than i am they're my children
[12:50] so i love them for many reasons
[12:55] and this is a natural love that we have
[12:57] for one another
[13:02] but there's no greater love that when
[13:04] you show a
[13:05] spiritual love now a spiritual love is
[13:09] when you lay down your life
[13:11] for somebody's soul
[13:15] you're willing to get your hands dirty
[13:17] to talk about
[13:18] things
[13:25] and you don't want to walk into show and
[13:27] tell and just talk
[13:31] because they want to kick you i've heard
[13:34] this so many times
[13:35] but when they see that you care about
[13:38] their life
[13:40] you're showing them eternal life amen
[13:43] you're showing them different than this
[13:46] life
[13:49] yeah we're short and it's time for us to
[13:51] start showing
[13:52] eternal life to others show them the
[13:56] gospel don't just tell them about it
[13:59] show them first and then declare or
[14:01] announce
[14:03] for the life of christ was manifested
[14:06] and we
[14:06] seen it and bear witness and show unto
[14:09] you eternal life amen
[14:13] showing it isn't an awesome thought you
[14:16] can actually
[14:17] show somebody eternal life
[14:20] which was with the father and was
[14:23] manifested
[14:25] unto us has has eternal life been
[14:27] manifested to you
[14:29] amen that which we have seen and heard
[14:33] declare we unto you that we can have
[14:36] fellowship
[14:36] together and that we can have
[14:40] joy what a wonderful scriptures there
[14:45] now when brother branham got back from
[14:48] visiting
[14:50] eternal life
[14:54] i like to make mention of some things
[14:57] that he said
[14:58] and just try to get the continuity
[15:00] because this is what we need to be
[15:01] showing others
[15:03] he said there are no words in the
[15:05] vocabulary to describe it
[15:10] but we can show it
[15:13] if you have it
[15:17] he said it was a pure love there was no
[15:19] jealousy no tiredness no sickness
[15:22] there was no selfishness mix in it why
[15:24] because all
[15:25] we heard was everybody was saying oh my
[15:27] precious brother it was about the other
[15:29] person
[15:33] and anytime they talked about themselves
[15:35] they said well i wouldn't have been here
[15:37] if it wasn't been for you it was always
[15:41] esteeming the other better than yourself
[15:47] he said this is something entirely
[15:50] different entirely different than human
[15:54] love
[15:55] he said it was a perfect love and he he
[15:58] says only
[15:59] supreme beauty and joy was what he was
[16:02] feeling there
[16:08] that's something we should be feeling
[16:10] inside
[16:12] he said a voice spoke to me this
[16:15] is what you preached that the holy ghost
[16:20] is
[16:23] this is perfect love nothing can nothing
[16:26] can enter here without it
[16:28] you cannot separate the holy ghost from
[16:31] perfect love
[16:34] you know we want to make it two
[16:35] different things
[16:38] but the voice spoke to him when he was
[16:41] feeling all this he says well what is
[16:42] all this
[16:44] he said the voice said this is what you
[16:47] preach
[16:48] what was the holy ghost
[16:53] you know we want to claim the holy ghost
[16:54] and it don't matter what kind of love we
[16:56] show
[16:59] you know we'll stand up i'm filled i'm
[17:01] sealed i got it
[17:02] no one's gonna talk me out of it and
[17:03] then you don't you're acting like
[17:15] to me a good evidence of the holy ghost
[17:17] is you have
[17:18] genuine perfect love not just being nice
[17:21] to people
[17:25] but you you're perfect love with the
[17:28] word
[17:29] you take the word you you love that word
[17:33] great peace have they that love thy law
[17:35] and nothing shall offend them
[17:40] that's why jesus said by this shall all
[17:42] men
[17:43] know you're my disciples or that you
[17:45] have the holy ghost
[17:48] when you can have perfect love
[17:51] one towards another even your enemies
[17:56] to me that's a mature disciple of a
[17:58] christian
[18:00] what good would it do to claim that you
[18:01] got the holy ghost and
[18:03] live a selfish life
[18:08] people look at having the holy ghost
[18:10] like
[18:12] let me see i got this card this card
[18:14] this i got
[18:15] oh here it is right here
[18:23] what good would it do that to to
[18:26] claim you got the holy ghost
[18:30] and live a selfish life
[18:35] what good would you claim to have a holy
[18:36] ghost and can't show others
[18:39] eternal life if all we can do is tell
[18:42] somebody
[18:42] but you can't show it don't tell me you
[18:45] have it
[18:46] you need to be seeking it
[18:50] get to a place where it's bubbling it's
[18:53] babbling
[18:54] jesus said it'd be like a a well sprang
[18:57] it up within the eye
[18:59] brother bran says i am more convinced
[19:01] than ever in my life
[19:03] that it will take perfect love to enter
[19:05] into that place
[19:08] so he's convinced before but when he
[19:10] went over
[19:11] he said i'm more convinced than ever
[19:15] he said press on to that perfect love
[19:19] which will take you
[19:23] to that beautiful joyful place beyond
[19:25] the curtain of time
[19:28] now this is what our messenger said i
[19:30] guess you know
[19:31] here's my my take on this
[19:35] i'm not gonna preach justification gets
[19:38] me there
[19:42] that ain't what my messenger told me i
[19:43] guess if i lived under luther's message
[19:46] i could go for it but we've got more
[19:49] truth and god
[19:50] expects more out of us
[19:58] the first thing he said to god when he
[20:00] came back
[20:01] he says oh god help me never
[20:05] let me compromise with the word
[20:10] let me stay straight on the word
[20:14] i don't care what anyone else does
[20:17] lord let me press on to that beautiful
[20:21] joyful place
[20:26] he said that one visit there to me
[20:30] has made me a different man he visited
[20:33] eternal life
[20:34] and it made him different he says i
[20:38] could never
[20:38] never never three nevers i think
[20:42] we were talking in our men's meaning
[20:44] about threes
[20:45] really brings the point across i can
[20:48] never never never be the same brother
[20:50] brandon that i was
[20:52] whether the planes are rocking
[20:55] whether the lightning is flashing
[20:58] whether
[20:59] the spy has a gun on me
[21:03] whatever it is it doesn't matter
[21:06] i'm going to press the battle and by the
[21:09] grace of god for i preach the gospel to
[21:11] every creature
[21:12] and every person i can persuading them
[21:14] to that beautiful
[21:16] place yonder
[21:23] notice how coming in contact with
[21:25] eternal life made him
[21:29] he was not interested
[21:33] in anything else
[21:38] it was just the opposite
[21:42] he was more interested in getting as
[21:43] many people to this place as possible
[21:48] he wasn't just amen
[21:52] now i'm going to go and live my life
[21:53] down here on the planet
[21:57] no if you really have it
[22:00] you want others to be here
[22:09] i questioned the believer claiming to
[22:11] have something so powerful
[22:12] that will make you love everyone
[22:16] including your enemies it'll make you
[22:18] steadfast
[22:19] unmovable always abounding in the work
[22:21] of the lord
[22:25] and yet live
[22:28] a selfish life
[22:32] i question that because i've got to stay
[22:36] with the word
[22:37] i've got to stay with the mess or what
[22:38] he said
[22:46] it's not about us just
[22:50] having a beautiful funeral service no
[22:53] matter what
[22:55] it's about coming in line with what
[22:58] the word wants us to be
[23:05] if i have eternal life how could it be
[23:07] living for myself
[23:12] the definition of the prophet gave it
[23:14] was living for others
[23:17] and spiritually speaking now
[23:22] you've got a whole bunch of people
[23:23] naturally they got all sorts of programs
[23:28] living for one another naturally but
[23:30] that's no more eternal life
[23:34] it seems like no matter whatever was
[23:37] going to befall brother branham's life
[23:39] he was more determined than ever to get
[23:41] souls to christ
[23:43] he went on to say the sons of kish
[23:46] may rise
[23:50] now to give you a little background
[23:53] king saul was the son of kish
[23:57] first samuel chapter 9 verse 2 tells
[23:59] that saul was a choice
[24:01] young man a goodly and there was not
[24:05] another uh there was not among the
[24:08] children of israel
[24:09] a goodlier person than he
[24:13] from his shoulders upward he was higher
[24:16] than any of the people
[24:20] so he was a choice goodly person
[24:28] sounds like the one we want to go with
[24:29] doesn't it the israelites came to samuel
[24:34] and demanded a king
[24:36] and they focused on having a king that
[24:38] modeled after the kings of other nations
[24:43] i mean did you ever wish that your
[24:45] pastor was like another pastor
[24:50] that's kind of what they were doing
[24:54] brother graham said the sons of kish may
[24:56] rise
[24:57] all the goodly things they do now he's
[24:59] i'm quoting him
[25:00] he says i have nothing evil to say
[25:03] against it
[25:05] giving to the poor and the charity and
[25:08] remember why
[25:09] why samuel told saul you're also going
[25:12] to prophesy
[25:14] and many of those men are great
[25:17] mighty preachers and can preach the word
[25:21] like archangels
[25:24] but still it wasn't god's will
[25:29] god was to be their king
[25:34] if the holy spirit is leading you
[25:37] he will always lead you to make jesus
[25:40] your king
[25:43] the king of your life the king of your
[25:45] will
[25:47] he's got to say so of your will
[25:53] let's look at the advice or the counsel
[25:56] of the seventh age messenger to us
[26:00] for the bride to make herself ready he
[26:02] says all my precious friends
[26:04] my beloved my darlings of the gospel
[26:07] my begotten children of god listen to me
[26:10] your pastor
[26:11] he says whatever you do now lay aside
[26:14] everything else until you get perfect
[26:18] love now that's really good advice he
[26:24] didn't say you better get into those
[26:25] seals
[26:26] [Music]
[26:28] you better get those trumpets lined up
[26:36] seventh grade education got revelation
[26:39] that was so high
[26:42] i'll just say it like this he got
[26:43] revelation that nobody else got
[26:46] and yet he pointed us to perfect love
[26:49] after he went and visited eternal life
[26:53] and came back
[26:56] nothing was spoken there about the
[26:58] mighty revelations
[27:02] but somehow we get thrilled with them
[27:05] i'll say i'm okay about getting through
[27:07] with revelation
[27:08] but if it don't produce a life
[27:12] if it don't make you want to lay down
[27:14] your life for a soul
[27:16] what good is it
[27:19] you know the prophet said we should
[27:20] better see jesus christ in every
[27:22] scripture in other words when you read
[27:23] it and you don't see jesus
[27:25] what's the use of reading it
[27:28] so if the revelation isn't going to lead
[27:30] us to become more like him
[27:33] and what was he he gave himself for us
[27:36] that's what he was
[27:43] oh i got it brother john i got it i got
[27:46] perfect
[27:48] brother bram says get to the place that
[27:51] you can actually manifest
[27:53] love to everyone
[27:56] even your enemies get to that place
[27:59] one place he said get to a spot that you
[28:03] can love everybody even your enemies
[28:05] and everything else i asked you today
[28:08] are you at that spot
[28:18] have you laid everything else
[28:21] aside to get to
[28:24] that spot no we just want to say i'm
[28:28] saved i'm going to heaven i've got
[28:31] eternal life and
[28:32] i don't i don't need to deal with that
[28:35] stuff
[28:36] why why do you not need to deal with
[28:37] that so that's in the message
[28:42] it's the responsibility that our seventh
[28:45] messenger gave us
[28:48] that came from him after he got back
[28:54] why do we want to put that just like a
[28:55] that doesn't mean very much put it aside
[28:59] if we're not at this spot then why
[29:00] aren't we pressing into that spot
[29:08] loving everyone including your enemies
[29:12] is perfect love
[29:15] it's a complete love what that word
[29:18] perfect means it means complete
[29:21] you can completely love everybody
[29:24] and not loving everyone the same
[29:27] all the time no matter what is an in
[29:30] complete love
[29:33] don't identify that as the love of god
[29:37] don't belittle god don't put them down
[29:38] here because you can't go up there
[29:41] just get serious and say god i need more
[29:43] holy ghost i need more holy ghost
[29:45] the more holy ghost the more love of god
[29:50] god ain't struggling loving
[29:55] frank brother god is love
[30:00] what brother branham was saying here was
[30:02] get to a place
[30:04] where you can have something to show
[30:07] the world
[30:11] because anybody can just love who they
[30:12] want to love
[30:14] and be standoffish towards other people
[30:16] they want to be standing anybody can do
[30:18] that
[30:19] there's no show-and-tell in that
[30:24] but when you can show a love to somebody
[30:29] that they talk behind your back brother
[30:33] branham said they come to brother
[30:34] branham and they told him they loved him
[30:36] and he knew they didn't he turned right
[30:39] back around and say
[30:40] i love you and he meant it
[30:43] he was manifesting eternal life
[30:46] he was showing them eternal life
[30:53] look at all the ways that paul showed
[30:56] that perfect love he showed he had
[30:59] eternal life we
[31:00] we talked about it all his journeys and
[31:02] his perils and his beatings and
[31:04] he got stoned in his prisons and his
[31:07] shipwrecks
[31:09] he was used by false brother and he took
[31:11] care of all the churches
[31:13] he was manifesting eternal life
[31:18] because prior to the nature change it
[31:21] was all about him
[31:28] what a marvelous opportunity to me paul
[31:31] had to show eternal life
[31:34] we want to show eternal life without
[31:37] suffering and i'll say friends it is
[31:40] impossible
[31:45] but yet we'll still struggle to do it
[31:48] are you saying brother john i don't got
[31:50] eternal life that's not what i'm saying
[31:55] jesus didn't stand in heaven and say i
[31:57] love you hope somehow you make it
[32:02] you know he came down for god so loved
[32:04] the world that he gave
[32:06] and you're going to tell me you for so
[32:08] loved that you're not going to give
[32:13] and you're gonna tell me you got the
[32:14] holy ghost and you're not gonna lay down
[32:15] your life
[32:18] that you got perfect love no you you
[32:20] need
[32:21] to take the definition that the prophet
[32:24] got he's a seer
[32:26] he came back from from beyond the
[32:29] curtain of time
[32:30] from eternal life he saw eternal life
[32:34] and he came back and he told us what it
[32:40] was
[32:43] i believe that many could bear witness
[32:44] that the life of jesus christ was
[32:47] manifested
[32:50] was seen bore witness
[32:53] and paul showed unto many
[32:56] people eternal life
[33:03] with his life you know when you read the
[33:05] letters you don't
[33:07] see him suffering
[33:10] see him instructing and and and he says
[33:13] he would say things like oh yeah i had
[33:15] persecutions in this place in this place
[33:17] and that place and
[33:18] you'd hear well um the holy ghost is
[33:20] telling me that uh
[33:25] bad things are gonna happen the places
[33:26] i'm gonna go you would hear
[33:28] little things like that but you never
[33:30] saw
[33:31] a life of suffering he never complained
[33:33] he never murmured
[33:34] he never squealed he never said it's
[33:36] unfair
[33:37] there was no reason for you to believe
[33:40] that he was being treated
[33:41] unfairly
[33:47] and i just say when you're so filled
[33:49] with the holy ghost you're so
[33:51] full of the love of god there's nothing
[33:53] but love that comes out no matter what
[33:56] jesus never complained on the cross
[34:04] are you to that point are you
[34:06] manifesting eternal life
[34:09] i know if i was to ask everybody's hand
[34:12] who's got your life
[34:13] boom the hands would go up but if i come
[34:17] over here and i said who's manifesting
[34:18] it
[34:20] well we would probably have our own
[34:21] little idea out where man i come to
[34:23] church i pay my tithe
[34:25] right we'd all fill in the blank how
[34:28] we're
[34:30] i i want us to take
[34:34] the words of the prophet
[34:40] i know it's not the mystery that you
[34:42] wanted here
[34:45] christ is hidden in simplicity you know
[34:52] he told paul told the same church that
[34:55] this
[34:56] love that he manifested in all those
[35:00] times
[35:02] was just a simple agape love when he
[35:05] laid down his life for everybody
[35:08] when he got torched and got back up
[35:10] remember stephen got stoned
[35:12] lord forgive him that was eternal life
[35:17] he was possessing eternal life and he
[35:19] was he was manifesting it
[35:21] and i'll tell you most people you throw
[35:23] stones at and they're calling you names
[35:25] and everything under the book
[35:27] now why didn't this man do it because he
[35:29] was manifesting
[35:30] something different than what other men
[35:33] had
[35:36] and paul described it to the to this
[35:39] church
[35:41] the same church that he had all he
[35:42] described all these things happened to
[35:45] he described it this love as totally
[35:49] selfless
[35:54] perfect love is not puffed up
[35:58] it doesn't envy or vaunteth itself
[36:02] it doesn't seeketh its own it doesn't
[36:05] think
[36:05] evil and it doesn't behave unseemly
[36:10] it's totally selfless
[36:15] he described it as the nature
[36:19] the same as the nature of an artesian
[36:22] well
[36:24] when you think of martijn well what do
[36:26] you think that thing just doesn't stop
[36:28] pouring out water
[36:33] it bears every
[36:36] situation that you're in it believes
[36:40] all things it's always optimus
[36:42] optimistic
[36:44] it keeps hoping in every situation
[36:47] amen brother larry is that what you said
[36:50] in our men's meeting
[36:51] it doesn't give up it keeps enduring
[36:54] and enduring every difficult it faces
[36:58] it simply never fails it's an artesian
[37:02] well the love of god it just
[37:03] it keeps bubbling
[37:12] this kind of love is something you can
[37:14] show
[37:15] and people will want to listen
[37:21] you know how gossip works right
[37:25] you know how bad how fast bad news
[37:28] travels
[37:30] it seems like everyone likes saying
[37:32] something negative
[37:33] about somebody
[37:37] i'll just say it like this it's their
[37:38] nature
[37:41] it's human love human love is a
[37:45] lesser love just like the prophet taught
[37:48] us
[37:49] hate is just a lesser law
[37:53] you know we look to the more the
[37:55] extremes the hate crimes and the
[37:57] killings
[37:58] but but when you don't go to the
[38:00] extremes it starts out
[38:01] with just in seed form a selfish nature
[38:06] it's a selfish nature and pretty soon
[38:10] you want to be on top and
[38:11] gossip has a way to get you on top
[38:15] because whoever you're gossiping to see
[38:17] you're going to look good in front of
[38:18] them
[38:20] it's like bragging
[38:23] now come on let the let let god
[38:26] speak don't turn this off
[38:30] why turn god off when he's trying to
[38:33] deal with
[38:34] changing your nature he's not wanting to
[38:36] feel bad
[38:39] just one the nature change
[38:44] proverbs 10 verse 12 says hatred
[38:48] stirth up strife but love
[38:52] covereth all sins perfect
[38:55] love covers a multitude of sin
[39:00] because you're caring more about
[39:04] the other person's soul
[39:07] than you are about their mistakes
[39:12] are you with me but hatred or a lesser
[39:16] love
[39:16] kind of wants to stir things up
[39:20] try to get you ever want to get a
[39:21] reaction out of somebody
[39:25] come on now i want to kind of ruffle
[39:28] their father want to see where they go
[39:30] with this
[39:33] but perfect love or just cover
[39:38] you know they came to jesus many times
[39:40] they wanted to
[39:43] trip him find him in a fault
[39:47] stir up some strife they were telling
[39:49] the people they were always trying to
[39:50] get the people against jesus
[39:53] but the love of god will cover a
[39:55] multitude of sins
[39:59] proverbs 17 verse 9 he that covereth
[40:02] a transgression seeketh
[40:06] love now i'm not talking about your own
[40:08] transgression
[40:10] but if you seek to cover somebody else's
[40:12] transgression
[40:14] you are seeking the love of god
[40:17] that's what the bible says but he
[40:20] that repeateth the matter separated
[40:24] very friends
[40:27] you want to talk about something what
[40:29] are you doing you're separating
[40:31] somebody from somebody
[40:35] tell me where god is in that tell me
[40:37] where the holy ghost is in that
[40:41] we have a way to show eternal life
[40:46] and you can't show eternal life
[40:51] when you're talking about others
[40:54] when you're talking about something they
[40:56] did wrong
[41:01] james chapter 5 verse 19 brethren if any
[41:03] of you be
[41:04] if any of you do air from the truth and
[41:07] one
[41:08] converteth him now this this means
[41:11] somebody that was in the truth
[41:14] and they aired from the truth it's not
[41:16] something that wasn't in the truth yet
[41:22] let him know that he which convert the
[41:24] sinner from the air of his way
[41:26] shall save a soul from death and shall
[41:28] hide a multitude
[41:30] of sins
[41:33] that's what the blood of jesus christ
[41:35] can do
[41:39] and i'll tell you without the blood of
[41:40] christ where
[41:42] would any of us be
[41:46] nobody in this room would want to talk
[41:48] to anybody in this room
[41:56] we would go try to find a church that
[41:57] we'd feel better when and the only way
[41:59] you'd feel better in that church is
[42:01] because you wouldn't know what they did
[42:04] as soon as they found out what you did
[42:08] you understand i'm saying we ought to be
[42:11] rejoicing in the blood of jesus christ
[42:13] that we stand here
[42:14] pure spotless sinness under the blood of
[42:17] jesus christ
[42:18] we should give him glory and we're being
[42:22] taught in the scriptures
[42:23] leave it under the blood don't be
[42:25] talking about your brother
[42:26] don't be talking about your sister
[42:31] say good things if you're having a hard
[42:34] time get the holy ghost
[42:36] i resent that brother john i'm sorry you
[42:38] resent that
[42:40] the holy ghost don't do that
[42:44] for you i say get more of the holy ghost
[42:50] i'm not trying to decipher who has it
[42:52] who doesn't but
[42:53] look god doesn't struggle
[42:58] if we're struggling get more god
[43:01] let's just keep it simple
[43:04] i'm not trying to devalue demoralized
[43:08] make anybody feel like they haven't got
[43:10] it
[43:10] i'm about pointing us to what we can
[43:12] have we can show people we got eternal
[43:15] life
[43:16] you're going to show them you got each
[43:17] other you're just going to show them
[43:18] you're religious when you do that
[43:21] you're not going to show them you got
[43:22] your life
[43:25] you may prove you're right you may prove
[43:27] that somebody else is wrong
[43:28] but you're not proving eternal life
[43:31] you're not showing them eternal life
[43:39] by this show and tell shall all men know
[43:43] you're my disciples
[43:45] showing them how to cover
[43:50] amen what good is love if you can't show
[43:54] it
[43:57] this by far was not supposed to be two
[43:59] services
[44:01] i can't believe the time that has
[44:03] trinkled on by already
[44:06] what good is love if you can't show it
[44:08] what good is love
[44:09] if you can't choose
[44:17] to demonstrate it in front of somebody
[44:24] what good was to say that you have it
[44:29] we've all heard that you can't get warm
[44:31] by a pain of fire
[44:34] you can't feel the warmth of perfect
[44:36] love if it's just
[44:37] quoted
[44:40] if it's just in somebody's head
[44:45] but if perfect love won't be projected
[44:49] then it won't do any good
[44:52] the prophet said when perfect love is
[44:54] projected
[44:55] then sovereign grace takes over
[45:01] not one perfect love is quoted
[45:05] when it's projected when it's lived out
[45:09] when it's demonstrated when it's shown
[45:13] amen it gets the job done
[45:18] and i'll tell you the if you think about
[45:20] the greatest things where god has
[45:22] expressed his love to us
[45:24] is when he has forgiven us of our all of
[45:26] our mess-ups
[45:29] that's it it hasn't been in
[45:32] you know the the the car i got the house
[45:35] i have
[45:37] you know what i mean you want more work
[45:39] more
[45:42] that's all you do you want more work
[45:43] more you don't want to work for you
[45:45] don't get
[45:46] it that's what bible says you don't work
[45:48] you don't eat
[45:53] let's take a look at faith for a second
[45:56] i don't got time to get in
[45:57] to all these scriptures but turn with me
[45:59] to james chapter 2 verse 14. we have to
[46:02] skip some
[46:03] that's my foundation for faith because
[46:06] we talked about living by faith
[46:09] but james believed in show-and-tell with
[46:12] faith
[46:13] and he gives five examples here about
[46:16] showing that telling wasn't good enough
[46:21] james chapter 2 verse 14 what does it
[46:25] profit my brother and do a man say
[46:27] that he have faith and have not works
[46:31] can faith save him that's a good
[46:33] question mark
[46:34] because we would say yes i'm saved by
[46:36] faith
[46:39] the bible says i'm saved by grace
[46:41] through faith
[46:47] if you don't have faith you cannot be
[46:49] saved
[46:52] you've got to believe the gospel
[46:55] but what would it profit if a man says
[46:57] i've got faith but he doesn't have
[46:59] anything to show
[47:02] no show just autel
[47:06] you know it's going to be another boring
[47:08] show and tell
[47:11] if a brother or sister be naked and
[47:13] destitute it gives an example here
[47:15] of of daily food and one of you said to
[47:18] them depart in peace and be warm and
[47:20] filled not withstanding you give them
[47:21] not those things which are needful for
[47:23] the body what does
[47:25] it profit
[47:30] marty brought this out the very last
[47:31] thing in his men's meeting
[47:34] that we need we need to show
[47:37] our love
[47:40] in the natural realm as well
[47:47] and one of you saying to them be part in
[47:49] peace be warm and filled
[47:51] notwithstanding you give them not those
[47:52] things where's your need for the right
[47:54] what
[47:54] does it profit even so now he goes right
[47:57] back
[47:58] to the spiritual even so faith
[48:01] if it have not works is dead being alone
[48:04] so he's not saying
[48:06] in those top two things up there is
[48:09] really
[48:09] examples of faith but
[48:12] it's a natural example but he said even
[48:15] so faith
[48:16] if it doesn't have works is dead being
[48:20] alone so if we
[48:23] can only tell somebody that jesus christ
[48:27] is
[48:27] eternal life but we have no life behind
[48:30] it we have nothing to
[48:31] show no different nature change
[48:35] no living for others no laying down your
[48:37] life no giving of yourself
[48:45] yea a man may say that was faith and
[48:47] have
[48:48] and i have worked he said show me thy
[48:50] faith without thy works
[48:52] you can't and i will show thee my faith
[48:56] by my works
[49:00] brother branham showed us eternal life
[49:03] he showed us what the perfect love was
[49:05] all about
[49:12] thou believers that there is one god
[49:14] thou does well
[49:16] the devils are in the same wavelength as
[49:18] you
[49:21] and they tremble about the situation
[49:23] because they know they're lost
[49:26] they got head knowledge
[49:30] will thou know o vain man that faith
[49:33] without works is dead he's bringing that
[49:35] again
[49:35] he's really driving it and he goes to
[49:37] another example
[49:39] was not abraham our father justified by
[49:42] works
[49:43] when it offered up isaac upon the altar
[49:46] remember that god said now i know
[49:51] well he knew before no i want to see it
[49:53] manifested
[49:55] i want to see it manifested
[49:58] show thou how faith wrought his works
[50:02] and by
[50:02] works was faith made
[50:06] perfect love is made complete
[50:10] when you live
[50:13] and the scripture was fulfilled would
[50:15] say if abraham believed god it was
[50:16] imputed unto him for righteousness
[50:18] and he was called the friend of god see
[50:21] then how
[50:22] that by works a man is justified
[50:26] not see then how that by works a man is
[50:29] justified and not by
[50:30] faith only
[50:34] works is required likewise also was not
[50:37] rahab the harlot justified by works when
[50:39] she was
[50:40] when she had received the messengers and
[50:42] had sent them out another way
[50:44] for as the body without the spirit is
[50:46] dead so faith without works
[50:48] is dead also
[50:51] brother bran said in the message the
[50:53] mark of the beast he says
[50:55] you think you have faith many times when
[50:58] you don't
[50:59] he says you just have hope
[51:03] in other words hope don't have any works
[51:10] faith does faith does
[51:14] james chapter 1 verse 21
[51:18] wherefore lay apart all filthiness and
[51:20] superfluity of nuts and receive with
[51:22] meekness the engrafted word which is
[51:24] able
[51:24] to save your souls be ye doers of the
[51:28] word
[51:28] and not hearers only
[51:32] what happens if you come to church and
[51:34] you just hear the word and nothing
[51:36] changes
[51:38] that bible says you're deceiving
[51:40] yourself
[51:44] but if any be i hear of the word
[51:48] i say if any maybe you hear the word and
[51:50] not a doer he
[51:52] is like unto a man be holding his
[51:54] natural face in the glass
[51:55] for he beholdeth himself real well when
[51:58] he's looking
[51:59] but then he goes away and he forgets
[52:02] exactly what he looked like when he went
[52:05] to church
[52:06] the conviction that he felt when he was
[52:08] in church
[52:12] you know because i mean let me just say
[52:14] it like this
[52:16] i've had pimples on my face before
[52:19] in fact i'll never forget this
[52:23] you i know y'all had it better than i
[52:25] did when i got married
[52:30] yeah the preacher looked at me and he
[52:32] says can't you do something about that
[52:34] big pimple
[52:34] right between your eyes just before
[52:37] we're going to get married
[52:44] no honestly i didn't mean that in a
[52:46] negative way he
[52:48] met well but how could that be
[52:51] comforting
[52:54] but he meant well i i love it i'll never
[52:57] forget it
[52:59] how many times you look in the mirror
[53:00] and you saw something you didn't like oh
[53:02] man that
[53:03] you just you get away and you forget
[53:06] about it well
[53:06] it wasn't bothering me because i
[53:08] couldn't see it but everybody looking at
[53:09] me could
[53:13] and sometimes we just get out of church
[53:15] because we want to stop looking
[53:17] at the reality of what's happening
[53:19] inside
[53:26] but whosoever looketh into the perfect
[53:29] law of liberty
[53:30] and what continue in other words i'm
[53:33] going to think
[53:34] about what was being preached done
[53:37] i'm going to let it soak in i'm going to
[53:39] let become a part of my life
[53:41] i'm going to let it change me from glory
[53:43] onto glory
[53:44] i'm going to become more in his image
[53:46] i'm getting ready for a rapture
[53:48] because i'm not ready yet
[53:52] that's the perfect law of liberty that's
[53:54] continuing therein being not
[53:56] forgetful here but a doer of the word
[53:58] this man is the man that's going to be
[54:00] blessed in his deed
[54:03] if any man seem to be religious and
[54:05] bridal is not his tongue
[54:07] but deceiveth his own heart this man's
[54:09] religion
[54:10] is vain now there is a lot of scriptures
[54:14] i've got to bypass and i'm sorry
[54:17] that just the way it is
[54:20] because i got to get to some important
[54:22] stuff
[54:23] but i want to ask you this question
[54:25] today
[54:27] do you have eternal life
[54:48] are you able to manifest it are you
[54:51] of those that have it that don't
[54:54] manifest
[54:56] that don't show it that don't live for
[54:59] others
[55:03] it's a sobering question and
[55:06] more wars have been fought over religion
[55:08] than anything else
[55:09] people will fight defending what they
[55:12] believe in
[55:13] and i'm not here to step on tolls i'm
[55:15] just asking the question
[55:18] are you able to
[55:22] show the eternal life that you have
[55:33] if you have eternal life you must be
[55:37] able to show it to others
[55:44] you can't put in your suitcase put in
[55:47] your wallet
[55:48] take the picture off the wall take the
[55:50] ten commandments out no it's got
[55:52] it's a life how can you hide something
[55:55] that's lived
[55:59] you just can't do it how can you shut up
[56:03] a detection well
[56:06] you just can't do it
[56:09] so if we have eternal life it's our job
[56:13] to manifest it
[56:17] to make sure
[56:20] that it's being demonstrated
[56:24] that you're looking for ways to show it
[56:28] amen find ways to show
[56:32] eternal life without this
[56:38] with a life being lived and it's real
[56:41] easy
[56:42] you don't live for yourself people will
[56:44] see it like crazy
[56:47] give up living for yourself and live
[56:50] for others and then you'll come in
[56:52] continuity what was taught to us
[56:58] turn with me to second corinthians
[56:59] chapter four
[57:03] paul said it like this as you're turning
[57:04] there in first timothy chapter six verse
[57:07] twelve he said fight the good fight of
[57:08] faith lay hold
[57:10] on eternal life they hold
[57:13] i already have it but why is he saying
[57:15] lay hold on it
[57:18] you know if if we took our philosophy as
[57:21] gospel we'd have to throw out scriptures
[57:24] like he that endure to the end throw
[57:27] that one out i got it
[57:28] that's right lay hold on work out your
[57:31] own salvation fear and trembling
[57:33] already got it don't need to work it out
[57:39] second corinthians chapter four verse
[57:40] three but if our gospel be hid it's hid
[57:43] to them that are lost
[57:45] in whom the god of this world have
[57:46] blinded the minds of them which
[57:48] believe not notice who got blinded
[57:53] those that believe not lest the light of
[57:56] the glorious gospel of christ who's in
[57:58] the image of god
[57:59] should shine on them for we preach not
[58:02] ourselves but christ jesus our lord
[58:05] and ourselves your servants praise god
[58:07] how many wants to be a servant to
[58:08] everybody
[58:10] for jesus sake for
[58:13] god who commanded the light to shine out
[58:15] of darkness has shined
[58:17] in where are hearts
[58:20] to give the light and knowledge of the
[58:22] glory of god in the face of jesus christ
[58:25] now who is he giving this light to
[58:29] that's right the light in you
[58:32] is for others
[58:35] and we're going to see that right here
[58:37] we're going to see eternal life in these
[58:39] scriptures right here
[58:41] but we have this treasure in earthen
[58:44] vessels
[58:45] that the excellency of the power may be
[58:47] of god
[58:48] and not of ourselves now how do we see
[58:51] this eternal life
[58:52] we are troubled on every side but we're
[58:54] not distressed
[58:56] we are perplexed but we're not in
[58:59] despair
[59:01] we're persecuted but we're not forsaken
[59:04] we're cast down but we're not destroyed
[59:06] so what's really happening here
[59:09] always bearing about in our body
[59:14] eternal life
[59:18] the dying of the lord jesus that the
[59:21] life
[59:21] also of jesus might be made manifest
[59:25] in our body this is how we can declare
[59:29] eternal life
[59:35] this is how eternal life can be
[59:37] manifested
[59:38] in our body if we're willing to
[59:41] die out to our flesh always bearing in
[59:45] our body
[59:46] the dying of the lord
[59:49] i mean jesus was he was dying out in the
[59:51] flesh
[59:55] he prayed
[59:59] i mean he learned obedience by the
[1:00:00] things he suffered
[1:00:03] he said father let this be possible that
[1:00:05] this cup passed for me he was tempted in
[1:00:07] all measures
[1:00:08] like we were he battled
[1:00:12] temptations he battled
[1:00:15] uh uh being the center of attention
[1:00:20] his reputation he did
[1:00:23] when he went on that mountain satan
[1:00:24] wanted offer him everything
[1:00:34] this is the way to show eternal life i
[1:00:36] know if it ain't exciting
[1:00:40] to me it's like we got a denominational
[1:00:42] belief of eternal life
[1:00:44] like no matter what you do down here
[1:00:46] you're still going there
[1:00:49] it's not about learning to do your best
[1:00:51] here
[1:00:53] it's learning to be so full of the holy
[1:00:55] ghost that you're actually living for
[1:00:56] others
[1:00:58] that you're actually demonstrating
[1:01:00] getting them to christ
[1:01:02] a heart a mind a will spending your time
[1:01:06] doing it
[1:01:08] forget about the pitfalls forget about
[1:01:10] how many times you fell
[1:01:11] just get up and start living for others
[1:01:17] we'll never make it on well i'm making
[1:01:20] it to eternal life because i only got
[1:01:21] these many things wrong it's not all
[1:01:23] these
[1:01:25] no we all got they're off we're off the
[1:01:27] chart man we're off the chart with our
[1:01:29] things
[1:01:31] so that has nothing to do with it what
[1:01:33] has everything to do with it
[1:01:35] is that you see in the scriptures
[1:01:37] tonight you see in the message tonight
[1:01:39] that it is our responsibility to
[1:01:43] show other people what eternal life is
[1:01:48] and if that's a struggle get into the
[1:01:50] message
[1:01:51] a little bit more start reading this
[1:01:53] book a little bit differently
[1:01:55] called the bible
[1:01:58] all right let's finish two more verses
[1:02:00] here and then we'll stand for we have
[1:02:02] lived
[1:02:02] for we which live are always delivered
[1:02:05] unto the death for jesus sake
[1:02:07] why why does that have to happen that
[1:02:09] the life also of jesus
[1:02:11] might be manifest in our mortal flesh so
[1:02:14] then death worketh in us
[1:02:16] but life in you you're dying out to your
[1:02:19] will so
[1:02:20] other people can can as as as brother
[1:02:23] branham said
[1:02:24] to have this or as john said in our
[1:02:27] opening scripture
[1:02:28] that they may have fellowship with us
[1:02:30] and that
[1:02:31] they may have joy we may have this joy
[1:02:33] together
[1:02:35] that's the reason you show eternal life
[1:02:37] to somebody not to show you've got
[1:02:39] something they don't
[1:02:40] to bring them to jesus to bring them to
[1:02:44] the love of god
[1:02:46] because if you're gonna if you really
[1:02:48] are gonna show people
[1:02:53] you've got something you will be nothing
[1:02:57] in the showing you will be nothing
[1:03:00] because all people are going to see is
[1:03:01] jesus
[1:03:02] when you get done demonstrating they're
[1:03:04] not going to say oh wow john that was
[1:03:05] amazing
[1:03:07] no they're going to say oh that's jesus
[1:03:10] that's jesus there's god
[1:03:13] there's something i've never seen before
[1:03:15] they're not going to be saying all this
[1:03:17] johnny god
[1:03:20] no he's not going to share his glory
[1:03:21] with anybody
[1:03:24] so you got to get me out of the picture
[1:03:27] the eye out of the picture and get
[1:03:31] christ only always living in
