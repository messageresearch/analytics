is growing jerusalem's restoring her national lifelong dethrone today she is calling her ladder race falling return o despise to your own the day of redemption is here men's hearts are failing for fear be filled with the spirits your lamp trimmed and clear look up your redemption is here heaven's powers are shaking and many mistaking god's meaning to be of the sky god's church is the power that's shaking this hour the day of redemption is nigh the day of redemption is here men's hearts are failing for fear and be filled with the spirits you're lamb cringe and clear look up your

change the order of service let's just sing learning to lean amen hallelujah help us to lean more on you jesus learning to lead i'm learning i'm learning to lean on us gaining more power than i've ever seen i'm learning to i'm learning to lean on jesus gaining more power than i've ever seen i'm learning to lean on jesus amen one more time learning to lead i'm learning to lean i'm learning to lean on jesus gaining more power than i've ever seen i'm learning to lean on jesus amen we need more power than we've ever seen because evil is getting worse and worse the world's getting worse the temptations are getting worse and we need to lean on jesus a little bit more amen and it's a a process to learn to lean because satan is wanting us to lean on our own understanding figure it all out and we need to learn to not lean to our understanding but to to lean on jesus i say it's a privilege that we have to come and gather together in the house of the lord despite uh maybe how the day's been busyness how we feel even if we're sick we could be in nigeria running for our lives so i say it's a privilege for us to be here to just you know i'm sure if we were all watching the super bowl we'd be excited we might also get excited about the lord amen amen let him know we're happy to to be in his house amen amen turn with me if you would to the book of saint peter chapter one as we continue on in the church order we are um we're saddened uh for um our the family of sister carolyn uh gazelle that's left behind we i know that if she was here she'd want us to pray for her family she used to really like that song shut in with god and when she would uh come here uh she'd shake her hand if you remember those that shook hands with her she'd she'd grab your hand with two hands and she said god bless you she wouldn't just do a little shake she you know you feel your whole body shaking she she really loved the presence of the lord and she stayed so faithful despite all that she went through with her family not supporting her but she had something that kept her and she's in a better place now but we need to pray for family amen amen before we begin reading here in first peter uh chapter one let's look to the lord and in a word of prayer heavenly father lord as we have endeavored to walk in the direction that you have wanted our little church to walk in and lord the testimonies that have come forth just from this church order has not only affected our church but lord we've heard so many testimonies of our lives being affected our homes being affected and we want to thank you for that lord we want to thank you for what you're doing inside of our hearts and our lives and we pray that you would fill us so full with the holy spirit lord that we would be able to continue to walk more and more in your holiness lord give us grace lord for those things uh lord as you spoke one time and it's been quoted many times from the pulpit you had many things to say unto us but we could not bear it lord so if you just fill us with more of the spirit we'll be able to bear the things that you've called us to do in our lives bless this word lord to our hearts as we read it and these quotes that we're getting into we just pray that you'd give us all revelation tonight lord let us not leave here uh in in a condition lord that we would be discouraged but let us leave this place today lord with a a greater revelation drawn closer to you lord and that these these words that we read from your book and the quotes from the message may they be an impact in our life lord may they bring a revelation to our lives and may we become more like you father will be ever grateful for these things lord we trust that you do them for we humbly ask that now in jesus christ's name amen amen i trust the lord do you amen amen first peter chapter 1 verse 13 wherefore gird up the loins of your mind be sober and hope to the end for the grace that is to be brought unto you at the revelation of jesus christ now only god can bring that amen as obedient children not fashioning yourselves according to the former lust in your ignorance but as he which have called you is holy so be holy in all manner of conversations because it is written be holy for i am holy amen and then just one more in matthew chapter 7 verse 13 and 14. enter he and at the straight gate for wide is the gate and broad is the way that leadeth to destruction and many there be which go in there at because strait is the gate nero is the way which leadeth unto life and few be the few there be that find it amen god bless you may be seated there are two ways god's way and we'll say the way of the world which is the devil's way which is the same way as man's way the same number and uh the way that we uh were were raised was not necessarily um the way that is perfectly god's way um even if we were raised um by um message parents and they tried their very best to teach us the right way um we did a lot of things because we were told this is what we do but it was not revealed to us by the holy spirit what holiness was so when we're we're sitting in a place where we have an opinion and an idea uh of what holiness is but really god is teaching us and god will continue to teach us um and the the moment that we feel that we we've got things pretty well sold up is is the time that we get in trouble and so we want to uh uh we talked about the call to become holy we last uh service we we uh entitled that responding to the call and we we all responded everybody raised their hands that i want i want to respond to this call and tonight i want to talk about entering into the door of holiness in other words we've responded but um there's there's times that we can respond to something and not continue to walk it so we want to be committed to the call of becoming more holy amen do not be satisfied with how holy you are or what you view as holiness but know that there's more to holiness because there's more to god and god wants to show us all but remember he he won't force it it has to go through female agency you've got to want it and it's a personal relationship you got to put your attention towards it um and and and have a yearning and a desire to keep walking in the direction as you go into that door i know what door i'm walking and saying when you walk into a restaurant you want to walk into a restaurant say you want to walk into arby's because you you want to get something there at arby's well you're not going to go into arby's and sit down at the table and order a t-bone steak because it's arby's you know what door you're walking into you know what they have so when you're you're walking to this door of holiness it's not your opinion of holiness it is god's holiness we don't want holiness to become just a part of our life we want to become our life it the bible says none of us will see the lord amen that's why the jesus said blessed are the pure in heart for they shall see the lord amen i would love to hear some testimonies i love for the church to hear some of these testimonies of what is happening in people's lives because of this church order i think it would be encouraging i think it's important to let the devil know what side you're on because he's he's constantly taunting us and we we need uh we need one another and uh we know god is pleased with us becoming more holy and so the the more we can make the stick make it real it'll be encouraging to one another so we need to make sure that we're we're staying committed to this and uh when we share these testimonies i think it helps us to make that commitment even longer if satan can't get us to ignore the straight narrow path of his holiness then he's going to do everything he can to distract us from staying in the path some may feel well brother john i've got the knowledge i know now you've told me so let's move on sometimes we can know so much that we forget what we're to become so we need to stay humble remember we quoted out of isaiah there the holy one of israel the lofty one that inhabits eternity whose name is holy i dwell in the high and holy place and with him also that is of a contrite and humble spirit to revive the spirit of a humble to revive the heart of the contrite ones so we need to stay humble stay committed to staying humble stay committed to staying humble because that's a a good sign that you're dwelling in holiness a lot of times believers don't even recognize what spirit they're projecting right amen so holiness has a lot to do with our spirit now if satan cannot puff you up with knowledge then he's going to try to destroy distract you with busyness don't allow yourself to be so busy from going from one frying pan to a next satan does not want you to focus on becoming what god is in other words satan wants you to think well holiness is just um a men cutting their hair or women letting their hair grow long or women wearing a dress and men not uh saying you know a bad joke and that's holiness but it's so much beyond that so much beyond that but the thing is if you don't have a heart to pursue it then you're going to feel like you're there and he'll do everything he can to distract you from getting serious about becoming more holy some may feel that they're there brother john you know i've heard this i've heard this okay you've heard this but what about becoming more what about more what about what you haven't heard and it's not what you haven't heard from the fivefold ministry or or or the prophet but what about god speaking to you that still small voice in your prayer closet about what he wants in your life so we want to be committed to that committed to staying walking not just with the things you've shown you but other things we put our hand to the plow we don't want to look back we want to keep moving forward amen so we've stepped into his holy sanctuary this church right here we've reverenced his house we've heard the call not just from the pulpit now but we've heard the call in our hearts from in our hearts it's personal to us remember god told moses i will commune with thee from above the mercy seat which sits upon the ark the ark being our heart where the where we we've kept the word we keep his commandments where there's life happening right there and he speaks to us amen amen he meets with us there it's not just from the pulpit here but something is spoken that that rings true in your heart and it means it's real to you so we responded to his call and now we're walking through the door of god's holiness revelations chapter 3 verse 18 jesus says i counsel thee to buy of me gold tried in the fire that thou mayest be rich white raiment that thou means be clothed that the shame of thy nakedness do not appear and anoint thine eyes with eyes that that thou may receive it looks like they're not holy and we need the holy spirit deity gold tried in the fire so as god comes and speaks to us to a heart there's assurance as many as i love that's right i rebuke i chasten i mean i want that person to be what i want them to be right amen and so he gives us his advice his counsel he says get excited zealious on fire burning and repent turn from where you're at that you've been used to all your life that you've walked like this for years and years and years and you're okay with it but but he's speaking and he wants us to turn around from that condition and walk towards him amen now god in this building should be speaking to every one of us individually about certain things same word being preached but god's speaking to each of us individually about things that he wants to see changed that's how personal it has to be oh personal it should be right he says behold i stand at the door and knock if any man hear my voice and open the door i will come in to him and will sup with him and he with me where does that happen the door the heart amen this is where the conversation is going it's not going in here and here and here but there's a realness to the word in your life that's why it's important to be prepared to come to god's house so you're not struggling in the flesh to hear from god amen we repent we turn towards god's direction of holiness you open the door of your heart to god's holy spirit holy spirit and let him come inside amen look at what we get here we get a communion he says to him that overcometh i will grant to sit with me so what are we going to overcome our flesh that wants to do its own thing amen we overcome all things all the things that that is standing in the way of god sitting on the throne of our heart and having his way amen to him that overcometh i grant to sit with me on my throne even as i overcame and sit down with my father in his throne he that have an ear let him hear what the spirit saith unto the churches praise god honey's got a ear it's not this one not this one it's right here it's a real it's a real ear brother branham said in the message behold i stand at the door and knock he says now can i say can you show me somebody that belongs to church thousands can you show me somebody that shouts thousands speaks into tons thousands works miracles thousands but show me somebody that sighs and cries for the abominations did in the church [Music] who's concerned about that amen see how worldly we get we get away cutting our hair wearing wrong dresses drinking cigarettes out there drink smoke and all these things you see where it's at we let down the bars and compromised with sin what we need tonight is to listen to the knock at our door at our door return to me he's quoting now if the people that are called by night my name shall assemble themselves together and pray then i will hear from heaven i just think it's beautiful that god is dealing with us it's a sure sign of a love affair it's an expression of i love you of course when we send and i love you we've got valentine's coming and i'm gonna send maybe i'll send brother mark i don't wanna say i'm gonna do it because then i have to do it so maybe i'll send brother mark valentine's card and say i love you you're my you're you're one of my valentines i got to be careful how i say that um and we think of you know expressions of love like this but you know god just wants us to be like him i would never send uh cheryl uh valentine's she'd be a better one to send a valentine's too i'd never send her a valentine's and say you know i love you i want you to be like me um but god sends his valentines he wants us to be like him amen he did his part to become us to pay for sin and now we are to become like him amen all right so we're committed to god's holy will now everything now is becoming more like christ because we've entered that door second corinthians 5 17 says therefore if any man be in christ he's a new creature old things are passed away behold all things are become new and all things are of god so we've entered that door now and it's not just doing a few things but all of our life needs to become pleasing to the lord yes so let him just speak to you let him speak to you don't don't wait for someone to tell you this is what you need to be doing don't do that don't do that don't have a relationship like that have it so real that you get used that's god i need to do that amen and when we give the lord liberty in our lives we're changed into the same image from glory to glory even by the spirit of the lord amen that you give god liberty he'll change your life if you say yes lord if that's your will thy will be done he'll come in he'll change your life you won't have to do it it'll be god inside of you doing it as sure as anything so we need to keep laying in the presence of the sun and ripen keep listening to the message keep listening to the tapes keep listening to what the prophet said because it is truly the definition of what will understand he is the interpreter of this book he he is the interpreter of the the message is the interpretation of this book for this hour for the message so we can understand what true holiness means now as we listen to the message that we're going to get a complete different perspective of god's holiness than we got from our parents our family our friends our neighbor the government brother branham says that we can't know god through books or education in the message identification of christ in all ages he said when a man is in the presence of god then he knows something right so isaiah really knew something when he got in the presence of the lord you know what he knew he knew he was undone he's unworthy yes amen that's that's the kind of knowledge we need amen brother brandon says you can take a dead center rotten carnal in his mind and his thinking criticizer of the power of god and bring him into the presence of the holy ghost there will be something happen to him sure that's that's it that that's why we should labor to get into the presence because god's going to do it and eating us here trying to hear the word trying to figure it out trying to you know calculate what we're going to do no just get into the presence of god and this word will become real to us we left off last service with quoting from the siege and that shall possess the gate of the enemy said women with their hair cut wearing shorts makeup and still professing to have the holy ghost something's wrong with that depending on the evidence of speaking in tongues jumping up and down or shouting and brother brandon makes this statement they fail that still small voice of the word in other words this is about feelings and about emotions god's with me yes it's and they do what they want to do but he says what they're doing is failing the still small voice of the word the word is our absolute not our feelings not our emotions he said the word keeps you balanced to the cross now if we got time i'll come back and i'll read these but if you want to write them down the scripture for women not to cut their hair it's first corinthians chapter 11 verses 1 through 15. paul starts out just say be followers of me even as i am of christ he says in verse 5 every woman that prayeth or prophesieth with her hair uncover dishonor or dishonor with her head and verse 14 says does not even nature itself teach you that a man that if a man have long hair it is a shame unto him you take all the the animals in the animal kingdom the the the males have the long hair they look real pretty right all the animals they they look so nice but man was made in god's image not the animals and that's why a man a man should not have long hair verse 15 but if a woman have long hair it is a glory to her for her hair is given her for a covering amen so it is absolutely the will of the lord for a woman not to cut her hair we it says if you're just going to trim a little bit you must just shave your head that's what the bible says so no cutting the hair of women it's just the order that god wants it's his word amen women wearing the wrong clothing as we're going to get into some of these quotes and we we've heard that a woman should wear shorts and shouldn't wear pants deuteronomy chapter 22 verse 5 the woman shall not wear that which pertains unto a man neither shall a man put on a woman's garment for all that do so are an abomination unto the lord thy god amen in other words they fail that still small voice of the word everybody else is doing in the church why can't i but it's a man-made church we're interested we're interested in what the word says that that still small voice of the word amen in the message the signs of his coming brother branham said sure well the people call you call you that in other words they came to brother bran said you're a prophet and he says well he said i didn't say that he says well the people call you that then why don't you teach them great things how to receive the gifts instead of talking to the women about wearing short hair and wearing things that they do and makeup and stuff like the way they do and things like that i said how am i going to teach them algebra if they won't learn their abcs they won't come out of kindergarten the common decency to line up with the word of god that's exactly right how you're going to do that you can't do it why they just just those god called is the ones that hear amen he said my sheep hear my voice amen that's right they know the voice of god it speaks from the word and the word is what does it yes that's why we cannot fail the word of god if the word of god says it it should mean something to us i'll say this you husbands with wives that are not lining up it is your job and we'll get into this god willing sunday because this is mainly for the sisters here but us brothers we need to be helping our wives line up with the word yes the word speaking to our hearts will change our spirit it will change our lives and the thing is we can't force our wife to do something to a point but we can lay down our lives and pray with them every day and pray for the situation and keep bringing the scripture and and serving them in such a way that they see christ in us absolutely so i just say to a point i mean you can't put them in a headlock and say you better put this dress on you can't do that but you know what you can get down on your knees and spend some time praying and say this is so important this is the word of god here it is they said we got this we got to do this honey yes first peter chapter 3 our opening scripture verse three whose adorning let it not be the outward adorning the playing the hair the wearing of gold or the putting out of the peril but let it be the hidden man of the heart so it's going from the outside take it nope don't be distracted by that let it be the hidden man of the heart in that which is not corruptable even the ornament of a meek and quiet spirit yes which is in the sight of god a great price now when i was a kid i i used to uh trade quarters for silver quarters and dimes for silver dimes because i thought the silver was worth more even though you couldn't get more at the store for it but it was of a greater price to me and god views a meek and quiet spirit and i'm talking as an ornament now when you see an ornament you see something that's there all the time it's just hanging around you all the time meek quiet god says that's a great price i put a great value now god he can create anything to do anything so for god to say that's a great price that's huge that is huge so it's really important here that we have more of a meek spirit and a quiet spirit than we would have the adorning of the hair and the peril that we put on the voice of god is speaking the sheep are hearing the voice of god amen and we must re have the mind of christ to obey that word amen brother branham said in the message he says when you come to total obedience then you can have possession but until you totally obey you've got to completely surrender your own thoughts your own will your own mind and let the mind of christ operate in you we can't pick and choose stuff we must make sure that our entire spirit is in order not just the outside you know we put so much emphasis got to make sure i wear this got to make sure i do this if i don't do this what are they going to think what about our spirit right amen our complete attitude has to be in order if it's not in order how are we going to be completely holy right if an ornament of a meek and quiet spirit is a great price in the sight of god then a forward loud spirit can grieve the lord amen i know we can have the holy ghost and that's wonderful that's wonderful but that doesn't give us any right to be grieving the spirit of god so holiness has to do with how we are inside amen we don't want to underestimate the importance of getting our attitude and keeping our attitude in order brother branham said in the infilling infallibility of god's spoken word he says you know i was telling the boys a while ago coming over i said about how we must be happy all the time amen amen i agree with that amen god don't want you to be sad you know what ill-temper does and that old temper that's one of the awfulest old things and it's about 60 of the cause of all sickness is temper yes what a statement it's about 60 of the cause of all sickness is temper yes sir he says them tantrums you fly loose remember you're just developing a cancer an ulcer or something like that when you do it when you get all stewed up about somebody i won't go back there anymore wait till i give them a piece of my mind he says all right remember you're the ones going to pay for it he says just be happy amen just be happy a temper is an expression of a bad attitude it's a result of you judging because you didn't get what you thought was fair so you're going to fly off the handle you're just opening the door for the enemy to come in and cause your body more problems now um i'm not saying that what you have is that 60 percent but who are you to say that it's only the 40. are you with me i just say it like this check up on that amen check up on that and make sure that your spirit is just as holy as what you're wearing amen brother brahman said in the message questions and answers he says brother branham what do you think about our sisters in the church wearing short dresses does it mar our testimony and set the wrong example for our young people in this our church in this our church it seems so to see a grown woman wearing a dress so short it shows her knees when she walks the man says ever who you are sister brother whoever it is i agree with you 100 it's a disgrace but tell me what to do about it i preach it just as hard as i know to preach it and they do the same yes so it's their judgment cause because the words went forth yes i'm certainly against them little old skin tight dresses i constantly fuss at my kids becky and sarah i don't care how little they are i just fuss at them all the time i think they even wear their dresses dot dot media takes becky apart every day about it see so yes it's not easy peasy dealing with it he says you you can expect that in the kids and you have to correct them but when it comes to a woman there's something wrong there [Music] see isaiah chapter 3 verse 16 says moreover the lord saith because the daughters of zion are haughty and walk with stretched forth necks and wanton eyes walking and mincing as they go and making a tingling with their feet quickly click cleals just want everybody to know i'm walking i don't care in the message wisdom versus faith brother ram says look at the modern one today little skinned down dress that every form she can't move without sinning walking tipping down the street with all the makeup and cosmetics of a max factor can put on nearly fixing her hair like some little girl wearing a little skirt just up about above her knees it's got uh if she's got on any at all wisdom versus faith brother brahm said in the message the resurrection of lazarus he says notice the signs begin to appear there was a man by the name of zacchaeus zacharias i'm sorry and his wife elizabeth religious holy people keeping the commandments of god and walking in all the statutes and ordinance of god blameless he says that's the kind of home we need today that's the kind of hole we need today don't you believe that he said in instead of that in the church today we have everything else but holiness and righteousness now this is brother random preaching amen that's what he could see but they were righteous people godly people walking in the commandments of the lord keeping all the ordinance blameless zacharias was a priest at the temple and his office was to burn incense while a prayer was being made and one day while he was in the temple burning incense gabriel an angel from god came down and stood by the altar of incense and said zacharias fear not your prayers is heard oh i love that his wife was barren she didn't have any children she was past the age of bearing but he lived right before god and he believed on god and all of his great dark long hours of worry finally the angel come and said god has heard your prayers now if you want god to hear your prayer and send an angel to your home live right do right treat everybody right be right before god and god will grant that to you amen we sing that song sometimes be glorified in our homes in our homes lord be glorified in the message god's provided way brother brahman says no there's only two ways of anything that's the right way and the wrong way and then ways are your ways and god's ways and you can't be in your way in god's way at the same time you've got to forget your own way to get into god's way and you got to get out of your way your own way to get into god's way for as long as you're in your own way you're out of his way so forsake your ways forsake your thoughts forsake everything and just rely uh just rely one thing on thus saith the lord that's all then you'll know you're right yes amen though you can't see it none of these senses will say it right every one of them will say it wrong but you know it's right because god said so that's what makes it right so you don't you can't go off your reasoning and what you think and what you've been taught all your life now his provided way has been his word it is his word god's provided a way for the human to live is not by your senses but by his word yes amen it's right there it settles it right there the two ways the straight way the straight and narrow path and the broad way many go to broadway you talk to the majority of the people they don't want to hear about holiness [Music] in the message a blessing prophet brother bram says and the whole church has become diabetic and every little cut that comes instead of walking on you pick at it it can't heal selfishness greed and more in more immorality everything else that's in the calendar of god's wrongdoing the church is picking up those habits men drinking smoking telling dirty jokes women cutting their hair wearing makeup and doing all kinds of things dressing themselves in moral light to face the people all those things are because it's a lack of the blood of the lord jesus christ to cleanse us from all unrighteousness amen that may seem hard sure it's hard but it's the truth i think ann was sharing a quote with me and i'm not sure if i got this right so you have to correct me in but we all uh have or plead enough of the blood to be forgiven but not enough to be committed to walking the way he wants us to walk set that the gist of it that quote that's the gist of it and you know brother branham the way he puts this statement all those things are because it's a lack of the blood of the lord jesus christ you cleanse us in other words we don't want to just to be forgiven we want to be cleansed of it so we can walk in the way that god wants us to walk if we don't he brother bran says if we don't belch forth the judgments of almighty god you're going to be caught one of these days in an atomic explosion here and will send every soul out into eternity to meet god who will only recognize the blood of his son christ jesus i like to see you come under the blood my advice to you is get right get right with god amen in the message what was the holy ghost given for brother graham says some of you people along saying well i can just quit smoking no it says well i just can't quit drinking i just i just can't quit this he said that's the holy ghost comes to live in you to make all those cants get away from you that's right make women stop cutting their hair make them quit wearing shorts and slacks no excuses make them quit tattling that's just as much holiness as anything oh yes that's what it's for to make you a holy life it'll follow the instructions of the bible every time a woman say it's just too hot i just have to wear these it gives me a headache if i let my hair grow but there's no excuses with the holy ghost amen is there to make it soul it'll follow the word just exactly that's what the holy ghost is to do amen follows the word amen it's to make you man turn your head from a half-naked woman and quit lusting after them and a church members that's what it's to do it's to quit making you smoke and drink it's to quit making you smoke and drink and wanting to be a big shot it'll take that out of you it'll humble you and make you to do that that's what the holy ghost is for it's a it's a holy life that's right make you quit gossiping make you quit playing cards and shooting crabs and all those things that that things that you do around the corner it'll make you quit you're carrying on the way that you're doing living untrue to your wife right that will make you do that's right it'll it'll make you um it'll quit making you want to marry somebody else's wife amen that's exactly right that's what it'll do it it'll make you live a holy life that's what the holy ghost is power for to set your affections on things above where god stands and the mind of christ is in you amen praise god he's still working on me to make me what i ought to be you say i can't do it oh i just can't do it sure you can't but the holy ghost come for that purpose that's what it did it come to take it out of you all them old habits and things that you're doing yes in the message hearing and receiving and acting brother ben says what we need is a blood transfusion the power of the holy ghost to clean up the church world from the life of sin women men professing christianity out to dances out to big worldly parties gambling smoking dancing women cutting their hair wearing short slacks all kinds of stuff like that and call themselves christians he said there's a weakness somewhere right it isn't in the power of god he said it's either in your pulpit right or it's in you i don't want to be in the pulpit one no that's all there is to it it's true we need a cleaning up so we need a strong pulpit we need these quotes we need the word we need to hear the truth yeah i know that this type of preaching does not encourage friendship [Laughter] it doesn't encourage i like you it doesn't encourage i feel comfortable in church i want to go to that church i know that but how can i stand before god and not present all the truth not declare all the truth not say this is god's will for our lives our relationship with god is more important than our relationship with one another if we don't stand for god then we're ashamed of god amen and to truly to truly love your brother to truly love your sister is to truly give them the truth amen regardless of your friendship with them truth sets us free amen and the rejected king brother ben says i think a man ought to be a man and a woman ought to be a lady i think that a christian ought to act like a christian and associate with christians yes and the church of the living god ought to be together with one heart one accord and have nothing to do with the world and when it comes to their ways and their habits and the message the uncertain sound brother said and someone said to me a minister called me up one of the sponsors of the following meetings uh one of the following meetings in the nation and said i hear that you preached so much against the sisters in our church cutting their hair and wearing shorts and things so it must have been a kind of a big denomination brother madam says i do i said now if you don't want to listen to that then don't send from me aren't you glad that he stood for the truth amen he didn't care about popularity he didn't care who was with him if you think about it he is preaching to the bride bride is the only one that's going to listen to him and make it amen so what does it matter everybody else is their choice they have a choice to to believe it's god's word or they'll listen to the history of the devil that says you know it's not that big a thing god still loves me and he said do you think they'll ever stop it and i said no do you believe there ever stopped sin he said no i said well why don't you preach against it then see he said what's wrong what's wrong is wrong somebody's got to breathe out against it tell the truth amen for when the wrath of god is poured out then you'll be without excuse so just because somebody is not going to follow the word doesn't mean we shouldn't stop preaching it right just because there's a a demonic spirit or a devil of unbelief that's going to sit there and taunt and come to church and still act the way that it's it doesn't mean we're not not going to stand for the truth and keep preaching it of course the devil hates this message he hates it he would just assume us not preach church order just let you know everybody just be happy one big family in the message believe us though this we've got to we might make it so that's encouraging right brother bran says and i walked up there and she had on enough of this hair manicure on her face ever what you call it and her hair was all fringed out like that and she had fingernails on the top of hers like that and a great big long earrings hanging down looked like a devil riding on her neck and going to use them for stirrups i looked out at that and her eyebrows way up like this and she turned around and said and she said are you brother branham i said brother did you say that was a saint he said yes brother branham he said she looks more like a haint to me instead of a saint oh what we need today is a cleaning up in the church hallelujah an old-fashioned baptism of the holy ghost back in the church instead of so much of this creed and carrying on the way we have it walk down on the beach there and they're laid than women professed to have the holy ghost right laying out there stretched out before men in bathing suits hmm brother this might make you vomit but let me tell you something i've got a girl coming on myself i said what are you doing lady i said isn't your father a minister said yes sir i said well she said i'm getting a suntan i said if my girl ever stretches herself out like that she's going to get a sun tanning but it's going to be from charlie branham's son giving her a tan with a barrel slat and bring her home that's right odd tanner how she remember that for a long time too going down like that oh it's just how they got you let down the vowels and old methodist preacher was preaching that long ago and he sang the song he said we let down the bars we let down the bars i don't know how it goes but we compromised with sin we let down the bars the sheep got out but how did the goats get in the goats get in if we don't preach it amen we've got to preach it you let down the bars that's what the matter amen don't hear that very many amens tonight he said but that's the truth amen right come back to healing the line hallelujah if you want god to return to you with blessings and things get back to the harness again preach the gospel stand on it it's either right or it's wrong if it ain't right forget about it but god's word is right then just stay with it amen he says i'm uh ringing you i'm twisting you and searching you and scratching you but it'll fix you up just right he says don't worry you worry i love that if you're leading somebody to the truth you don't have to worry about it amen let's stand together psalms 30 verse 4 saying unto the lord always saints of his and give thanks at the remembrance of his holiness amen we've heard the call to become holy we responded to that call we're walking through that door of commitment because as god continues to show us speaks to our heart we've got to have that yearning and that desire to keep walking it never be satisfied with how holy you are never be satisfied with it reach forth what god is because you are the example to the whole world what god is and i don't want to be satisfied with comparing myself with brother mark i love picking up not picking up brother mark but using brother mark i don't pick on him i don't do i brother mark okay i thought for a minute i did there but if i compare myself with brother mark well i'm just as holy as him i i wear tie like he does i cut my hair like he does i don't swear like he don't swear but if i compare myself with brother mark i'm going to get to a place somewhere that i'm there and my attitude my spirit is going to be there but if i compare myself with the word when it does speak and it's just going to be a little talk because you know we've been hearing the word the word for a long time but if we don't let it penetrate we don't let it deal with us it can't do any good right so we've got to allow the word to challenge us to become more holy don't ever compare yourself with somebody ever ever it is unwise compare yourself with the word with with the message and all these things these quotes that we heard these are in brother branham's messages just want to say get into the message listen to the message listen for him speaking so often our carnal nature wants to hear something that we haven't heard before looking for something to to benefit us instead of just listening for the voice of whatever god wants to speak amen because there's a lot of things that can be spoken out of a message but we can get to a place with our attitude that we turn off our ear to certain things and that's why jesus said he that has an ear to hear we've got to hear what the spirit is saying to us the church i'm not ready for a rapture i'm not holy enough i'm not filled enough with god's love i don't have enough amen so i gotta let this word be my example amen amen amen let's bow our heart amen and a word of prayer heavenly father as we come before you today we thank you that you've provided to us a messenger in this hour you sent a message for us lord all the churches have this book called the bible they may not all minister from the king james but there's enough scriptures that talk about holiness and things and the other in the other bibles and most other bibles and perhaps one that would be read the most the niv but lord we need the interpreter of this word you send them you sent a messenger that fully interpreted this for us in this age because you said unto the angel of laodicea write these things you spoke to him and lord he spoke to us now lord your prophet said that if we had any questions to go back to the tapes go back listen to it lord we want our church to be in the order that would be pleasing to you not to be pleasing to me or one another but what would be pleasing to you and lord we want our lives to be in that same pleasing way that same pleasing order and we know lord that in a natural comfortable state we're not going to be pressing towards that laodicea's is is pulling us is is is is getting the church world to the place that the actual believers are becoming uh more in love with pleasures than they are with you lord god we need help we need a great portion of your spirit we pray that you would fill all of our lives with more of you she would help us to take these words that were read from your holy book and from the message of the hour and that you would come in as the prophet said just come inside of us lord and and take out the things that should not be there in and and set our affections on things above and and live that life to us lord live it through us lord jesus we invite you into every one of our hearts lord give faith lord to each one that perhaps should be struggling with certain things and questioning and doubting how can things change from how they are to where they need to be lord would you just give them that faith to believe it lord to hold that right mental attitude you said uh the prophet said that it bring every divine promise to pass lord if we can just maintain that right attitude even when the men would come up lord uh in in the prayer line brother brahms prayer line and and um they didn't get healed right away brother your your servant just told keep on believing keep on trusting keep holding to that lord i pray may your that same voice of god come forth to each of our hearts may we just hold on to your word lord believe that word and not not try to lead your own understanding how it's going to happen but just believe for the holy ghost to come inside of us and live it out through us grant it lord jesus we thank you for these things lord we give you the praise and honor form in advance in the precious name of jesus christ amen amen can you give thanks to the lord amen i know i just it's been a little bit hard on the on the sisters in these uh quotes that we've read but um god willing let's pray for the brothers for the next service because they have a hard job they have a hard job
