TRANSCRIPT
========================================
it's also in your hearts jesus said heaven and earth will pass away but my word shall never pass away that's why we must receive all of god's word into our heart not our head into our heart if you don't receive it into your heart it will not establish you believe in the lord thy god so shall thy be establish believe in his prophets so shall you prosper but it has to be in the heart if it's just in the head somebody smarter than you is going to come by and talk you out of it the devil's going to use somebody now jesus wanted us to receive more of his kingdom when he taught us to pray let thy kingdom come let thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven so he taught us how to receive more of his kingdom how to receive more of the government we need to learn to pray lord let that kingdom come not well it'll come if he wants it to until then i'm just going to do what i want to do i'm sorry he's not that type of god he won't come unless you're you will find me you will search me and find me you'll find me when you search for me with all your heart amen he requires more of our heart amen god's promises are settled in heaven let them be settled inside of you they are attainable simply believe that there is no higher law in the universe in other words if god gave you the promise don't let a devil tell you anything different there is no higher authority god cannot lie his word cannot fail it will accomplish its role second corinthians chapter 1 verse 20 for all the promises of god in him are ye and in him amen unto the glory of god all the promises of god are gay and amen not some of them you can depend on every one of them repent be baptized every one of you in the name of jesus christ and you shall receive the gift of the holy ghost well brother john i got baptized four years ago and i still haven't received it stand on the promise because god has never failed amen amen they've never failed not one time god has an impeccable record it's undefeated he's the undefeated champion amen god is unchangeable he is the same yesterday today and forever amen hebrews chapter 6 verse 13 for when god made his promise to abraham because he could swear by no greater he swore by himself think about it there was nobody great you know how it is you go to somebody and you make a a agreement you you you swear by something greater there was nobody greater than god verse 18 it is impossible for god to lie now that ought to give us a strong consolation who have fled for refuge to lay hold upon the hope that set before us which hope we have as an anchor of the soul both sure and steadfast which entereth into that within the veil that's verse 18 19. sorry that i didn't say that we have an anchor inside it's god i'm relying on god inside i'm not relying on my head that thing is so up and down you can't even make it to the day through the day with and be straight in your head but god is straight he's consistent and i'll tell you when things are shaky all around us go back to calvary go back to the word he makes all things beautiful now what are god's promises given for i want to step into this a little bit because we're a natural people that want god for natural things and i'm not saying that god isn't there for natural things i'm not saying that i would never say that but if that's all god did for us what would happen at the end we'd just be the absolute most blessed sinners the rain falls on the justin unjust god's spiritual promises are not just meant for our natural benefits they wanted to use brother branham to beef up their churches to draw the crowds to find out where the oil was buried to meet a lot of natural and a lot of natural desires and a lot of natural needs and i'm not against those things but jesus didn't just bear the stripes for our body's health no sir our healing is a promise from god and we need to learn to stand on that promise amen he already paid the price for the doctor's visit for the for the prescriptions amen all we need to do is only believe only believe the price was already paid but remember the needing the needed healings were just the bait on the hook we need to get hooked on jesus isaiah chapter 53 verse 7 he was oppressed and he was afflicted yet he opened not his mouth he is brought as a lamb to the slaughter as a sheep before the shears is dumb so he opened out his mouth just picture jesus going to calvary today oppressed afflicted and he kept his mouth closed as he was suffering he was taken from prison and from judgment he was just verse eight verse three he was despised and rejected a man a man of sorrows acquainted with griefs surely he carried our griefs and our sorrows with him all the way to calvary as he was despised written stricken smitten of god and afflicted for us and you know what we did we just hit our faces remember when somebody first told us about jesus he died for you i'm fine i'm fine thank you don't need it i've been going this far in my life i don't need any help just hit our face think every single person was acting like peter because we're all in sin and did not really realize that we were going to hell without jesus peter did not esteem jesus what he did even denied him so he didn't just go to calvary for my body's healing it wasn't just so i could prosper in this life have a new home or or a new car or or something like that verse 5 says but he was wounded for our transgressions he was bruised for our iniquities and the chastisement of our peace was upon him calvary had to do with something other than my prosperity in this life it was a prosperity of my soul amen it was an increase to the god's kingdom the wall of sin of unbelief and a corruptable nature was dismantled between man and god right at calvary calvary opened the door for us to have fellowship with our creator amen to come into the image of our creator so he could so we could have proper fellowship if i could say it like this he told the woman who who did worship god he says you don't even know what you worship how many people are going to church today worshiping and don't even know what they're doing they don't even know the god they're worshiping calvary opened the door that god's holy spirit could come into our life and we could know god in a proper way that we could worship him in spirit in the spirit of the holy ghost and he's seeking those today that will worship him in that way he's going around the globe he's going in every church he's going down every every aisle every every row every pew and he's looking for someone that will worship him in spirit and truth because he is a spirit and they that worship him must it's a must it might be an option to our attitude but you want to find favor with god i'll just say like what he said to cain if thou doest well thou will be accepted praise god how many love the word you know all you got to do is say praise the lord i love you jesus knock those demons off all those throw cold informal feelings kind of trap us into some intellectual relationship with jesus christ we don't have an intellectual relationship with jesus christ we have one that goes deep inside our hearts amen god's promises are to bring a spiritual increase to god's government are you with me ii peter chapter one verse number three we've got to see what these promises are for they're not just for our natural life according as his divine power praise the lord love everyone getting into the pulling up their bible getting into it according as his divine power have given unto us all things that pertaineth unto life and godliness through the knowledge of him that have called us to glory and virtue whereby are given unto us exceeding great and precious promises hallelujah and that by these precious promises we might be partakers of his divine nature that's what they're for so i can become like jesus i wonder how many times we come to church and we want a promise of god that will change our nature having escaped the corruption that is in this world through lust and besides this giving all diligence add to your faith virtue strength and to our virtue knowledge and to our knowledge temperance and temperance patience and to our patience godliness and to our godliness brotherly kindness and your brotherly kindness charity and i'm telling you if you have all that you may have a a 1967 volkswagen you might have a 2021k i don't care but you need this right here that's what this is about it's about prospering in your nature prospering in your soul becoming like jesus christ in the very image of god that's what the promises are for god's promises in our life are to bring back such an increase of god's divine nature to all things our gods all things are gods in other words god owns our life god owns our soul god owns our will our time our our pocketbook i think this is a good time to take up an offering second corinthians chapter 5 chapter 5 verse 17 second corinthians chapter 5 verse 17 therefore if any one of us are going to be in christ if any man be in christ he is a new creature he's not an old creature with a new paint job new curtains new carpet he's new on the inside a new nature change old things are passed away behold all things are become new now i just want to say this today none of us have fulfilled this scripture brother john i'm offended i'm leaving here paul did not fulfill this scripture that's why he kept pressing towards the mark it's really good i think it's the attitude that we have well i'm a christian i got baptized i got the holy ghost i'm going to heaven on bride it's a carnal understanding is what you have the interest needs to be all things in my life need to become gods not trying to make everything you got god except it's a difference verse 18 and all things are of god he basically just takes your life and rips it open he says i'm taking this out and this out and this and i'm giving you this this this is my will this is what i want you to do and so he can stand back and say everything there is mine everything he's my elected official you know what i'm going to make him an ambassador i'm going to give him a ministry he was doing his own thing now he's going to do my thing amen all things are of god who have reconciled us to himself by jesus christ and have given unto us the responsibility of restoring others to christ i wonder how often we even think about that i'm talking about god's government here god wants to make an increase to his government the government is upon his shoulders he has elected officials he has called us to be ambassadors amen to wit that god was in christ reconciling the world to himself and imputing not imputing their trespasses upon them and committed unto us the word of reconciliation let's hit that next verse if we could now then we are ambassadors for christ we got a different job amen do you ever think about somebody that's an ambassador you know we've heard about uh american and embed ambassadors ambassadors and embassies you're the man in other countries and how they're bombing them are they kind of scary but it's a hope for those that are trying to flee for freedom we come across people who get desperate they they're looking for help for life you are the ambassador the ambassador for christ as though god did beseech you by us we pray in christ's dead be reconciled to god god uses us to help others get to jesus and if they're already to jesus god uses us to get him closer to jesus closer to jesus don't and you know i think jesus just wants to put his arms around us hug us and just pull us up real close to him amen we have that tendency to like as a child oh you remember when grandma and grandpa used to club ya i miss you too grandma and we want to get away and kind of do our own thing we have that tendency to kind of want to do our own thing sometimes we can drift off we just got to get back to jesus amen now we cannot lose focus on the purpose of god's promises for our life they're to change our nature so we can fulfill the will of god if we lose that focus and we just use god's promises for our natural life that is not even interested to us there's no interest to it why we need to keep focused on the real purpose of god's promises we've seen ministries that encourage you to use god's promises to get what you want out of this life a fleet of cadillacs prosperous jobs hefty bank accounts greatly it's about to greatly influence others we've seen them out there they're they're they're they're just on a lot of the tv channels a lot of the radio stations but what will all that matter on rapture morning how would any of those things get you to have favor with god or to make you ready when god's whole heart is he wants your will to be yielded to his that's his desire and he will not force himself on us and then we're going to take his word and use his word to prosper our life if i understand the scripture the scripture says i would that all would prosper even as thy soul prospers soul first then the other jesus didn't go up to the rich young ruler and say you rich you're rich i blessed you you should be thankful that i gave you all this money in fact he said you need to get rid of this great blessing because it's standing in the way between your will for me in your life because god will not force himself on the rich young ruler he won't force himself he won't make us do his will he'll put us in very uncomfortable positions he'll make us rethink the decision that we made he'll make us say oh make us get to a place that in our heart we say oh to jesus i surrender [Music] because he wants to be the king of our life the lord of our life not just the savior of our life and the prosper of our life there's an interest to the nature of god being in us that god is concerned about we need to have that same concern amen now the scriptures have taught us what the promises are for look at abraham who received the promise of god for a land genesis chapter 12 verse 1 now the lord had said unto abram get thee out of thy country and from thy kindred and from thy father's house onto a land that i will show thee so god right off the bat genesis chapter 12 promises abraham a lamb god told abraham to separate from his family look even even he had to separate from lot who was a halftime believer he sat in the church with the believers and believed half the time genesis chapter 13 verse 14 and the lord in genesis chapter 13 verse 14 and the lord said unto abram after that lot after notice after that lot was separated from him he said now lift up now thine eyes and look from the place where thou art northward southward eastward westward for all the land which thou seest to thee what i give it and to thy seed forever the very promise that god had given now abraham is laying his eyes on it brother sister there's going to have to be a separation a lot of separation that takes place in our life if we're going to receive all of god's holy ghost all of god's nature how do you want me to say it we might have to separate from the halfway believers god word calls for a total separation from unbelief amen now this land right here is a type of the nature that god wants to give us think about that this land that god showed abraham in the natural is a spiritual type for us of his nature that he wants to give us his divine nature the holy ghost the new birth however you want to word it but a separation is required and we need to keep adding to that divine nature from glory unto glory line upon line hear a little there a little keep adding his divine nature to your life by using the promises of his word because that's what the promises are for do you want the devil to get off your back because you can't stand him bothering you so you can live the way you want to live in this world or do you want him to get off your back so you can have all of god inside of you amen because that's the land amen that's the land amen now you're going you're going to have to fight for it just like joshua and caleb did the children of israel they had an attitude of i can still serve god still love him still do all the things that the law requires on this side of jordan in other words this side of the nature of god living in me this side of the holy ghost living in my home living in my life i'll serve god here in this man-made system in other words what god wanted me to do what god has given me and what god is telling me to do to go over there i don't need to do that it's a man-made system that's why they got so many man-made religions out there i hope you're getting something out of this you know you just can't be a tagalong they were a tagalong god won't let us in the promised land being a tagalong you can't just say oh i i believe in moses our deliverer he was with us for for 40 years and we were our fathers eight men in the wilderness okay okay and jesus said to everyone dead speaking of the spiritual part because they were unwilling to go get the divine nature of
