nothing else to wear so much we could have wore black suits again anyway we want to sing this song I wrote this many years ago I tell you what it's more it's more signs of the times and things that are happening you know we've always we know the prophecy hanging over America and you know what Russia is lining up everything before this service is over we could have another president and it could be a woman you know that's just the fact that's the way things are we're living in the evening time of the evening time how many believe we're in the season of the coming of the Lord [Music] I woke up this morning I took a look around I wondered would this be the day that I would not be bound but the day is passing the night is stealing on before the evening Shadows Fall you might just run me gone we are in the season of the coming of the Lord the signs are all around us and the word has been restored you can take away the promise of the day we've waited for we are in the season of the coming of the Lord you believe that this morning [Music] listen the fields are right for Harvest the day is almost past how quickly the grain is ripened for the reaper to come at last Israel's inner Homeland flag ways in the sky oh it's more than just a feeling things I know the time is now other coming of the Lord signs are all around us and the word has been restored you can take away the promise of the day we've waited for we are in the season of the coming of the Lord we are in the season of the coming of the Lord the signs are all around us and the word has been restored you can take away the promise [Music] of the Lord [Applause] and since last night I don't know if it's the weather but he's got a frog this morning that just won't go away but I would like to say I'm so thankful to be here this weekend y'all have been such wonderful wonderful people to us fixing us dinner last night it was so good I just thank you for all the fellowship all the kind words and I've just watched these these young men up here on the front row of these young women how they worship God it's such a young age it just touches my heart just keep on going keep on moving forward and serving Jesus let's give these young folks a good hand Caleb would you come to see me [Applause] well she stole what I was gonna say because I was sitting over and I was listening to him singing and I thought man what beautiful sound that must be in heaven to hear these little voices sing and worship and say amen and and we were um that asked me about the song Caleb wrote this song we got on the plane yesterday and kind of in a hurry trying to get up here and when you take off out of a plane you're on the ground you're grounded it might be raining maybe storming maybe snowing sleeting but once you Crest through that that cloud and you get just a little bit Above All That the Sun's shining the weather's perfect that's right you don't you don't if you don't feel the cold you don't feel you're sitting just in the presence of of what you're in that that airplane I was thinking about how that sometimes in life you're grounded like that the storms are hitting you from every angle that you turn you get up in the morning job's not going right maybe there's something going on with family and you get down on your knees and you think man the storm but just above your storm cloud there's a little sunshine that sun is always there it never changes it's the same yesterday today and forever it's always going to be there Through Your Storm after your storm before your storm for your next storm Crest that cloud just a little bit and right above it you'll see the glory of the son of of God as he as you as he sings this song he wrote it I like to say I wrote it I didn't write it he wrote it the sun always shines [Music] Lord I've been here before with both knees planted on the floor I know seeing Caleb hand in each trial I face I ask for your mercy and Grace oh even in my darkest days the comforter still softly conveys [Music] my child though the darkness arise the sun always shines [Music] to fill the world with his splendor this life-giving Source will help you stay the course if in him you'll enter and when your tears fall like rain bear the pain oh just lift up your eyes it always on time the sun always shines [Applause] Lord I often wonder why the king of glory gave his life for me I'm humbled by this tragic scene his blood fell from my princess [Music] I now captured by this love divine [Music] [Music] this life-giving Source will help you stay the course if in him you'll enter and when your tears fall like rain can't bear the pain stop your eyes he's always on time the sun always shines to fill the world with this Splendor this life-giving Source will help you stay the course if in him you'll enter and when your tears fall like rain and you can't bear the pain just lift up your eyes he's always on time the sun always shines lift up your eyes he's always on time the sun always shines the sun always [Music] [Applause] I want us to sing and sing this song again you know a lot of people like to do away with a cross they just have to do away the blood they churches all over the world have done away with the gospel disappeared they just go to church and just do out of social going to church if you move the blood out of the church and he moved across out of the church that's right and what kind of church do you have because it's by his blood as we've been saved but without the shedding of blood there is no remission of sin I'm glad he died for me I'm glad he hung on across from me I'm glad the blood's still alive today listen [Music] this is back this was the beginning of the end with every fragile step he grew more and more determined to finish it the world saw a man with a tree on his back they left but God saw his son who he loved suffer more than that no he didn't look he carried me he didn't just count the car but he counted me [Applause] so much has been said what happened to Calvary oh but I believe he didn't just carry the cross he carried me aren't you glad of that would you just slip your head up and thank you for that [Music] Mercy help me to a son as a blood fell down beyond the moment Scar the hands and feet of one I'd never met yes the world saw a man die of mortar between two things all around Bridge us through [Music] eternity be the cross he carried me [Music] Lord he didn't just count the cost he counted me so much has been said and what happened at Calvary but I believe he didn't just carry the cross he carried me praise God praise God well you folks just sung it out of me last night and so I'm just trying to you know I'm making you some ugly faces so I'm not making ugly faces at you I'm just trying to get them high notes that keep me up in the air I tell them I'm too old this ain't that high anymore let's let this just sing this song here I want him to leave this song you know when you go through something and you want to Lord why am I going through this I suffered depression for almost 20 years and uh you know it was just a it was a terrible time there were days it was hard to get up just to get the shave and get just get up and go to the sink and shave it was hard for me to do that it was a it was a nightmare and everybody said well what's wrong with you well you really don't know you really can't say you're not you don't have a heart attack it's not cancer it's not a headache it's not the answer to that but when the devil can can compress his darkness and Gloom around your life and cause you to go into depression I tell you what it takes the real hand of God to move you out that's right but I'm living proof he does that I walked into a little church in Calhoun Georgia and I was broken as a Brokenness a man can get I don't remember much of the sermon I just stopped there on the way back from Atlanta and I just said I know there's a message church here walked in and said on the back row and at the end of The Sermon Just a church like this not not even this many people here I ran down the aisle I meant I make business with God when I the pastor just come stepped up from the pulpit and I just fell in his arms when I walked back to my seat I was a free man no more depression if God done that for me he can do it for years but you wonder why you go through these things you wonder why and this is why because somebody here may be facing depression and knock you look here in the eye and say I know because I've been there just such this time it is [Music] why did I walk through the valley why was I forced to my knees why did the sun part and drive me as I walk through the desert a defeat and then came the clouds and the rain fell I thought I'd never make it through the night but God gave me the answer when I prayed with you he helped me see the dawn behold the light I can with the brother say I know just what you're going through I can pray with the sister in the midst of her sorrows and say I know because I've been there too I can put my arms around someone who is down and tell them to have faith and confidence what in pain I could not see I now fully believe God prepared me for such a time as it is foreign [Music] [Music] struggles are endlessly pressing but your purpose is Somewhere In God's Time right here but just keep on walking that good good road for night leads to a stronger wiser day and when they ask the reason for the path you have tried you know without a doubt [Applause] the brother who is bearing a burden and say I know just water you're going through I can pray with a sister in the midst of her sorrow and say I know because I've been there too I can put my arms around someone who is down and tell them to have faith and confidence oh what in pain I could not see I now fully believe God prepared me for such a Time praise God our two friends we all know that when he comes off of the seat The Mercy Seat it's over so if you're hanging around waiting to get in I'll tell you I'd come on in while they are cause the door is wide open because we know that any moment the door is going to shut and I don't know we don't know he could be rising from the throne right now but when he does friends we're going to leave here and then there'll never be another Gentile will be saved so I would get into the ark if I were you this song is I wrote this song and I tell you what it stirred me even I wrote it and I've repented because I tell you what I don't want to miss it there's nothing here worth missing heaven for he could be risen from the throne to come his children home and wants to save yours left to stand there'll be no sacrifice for man no more no more but there's no one left to call upon run to Jesus while there's time don't you be left behind he could be rising from the throne through every age God's had a plan [Music] how he'd redeemed Fallen man through bloodables and coats and Rams Christ himself became the lamb then he'll send it up both High shut down at the Father's Side to make intercession for my sins day of Grace soon will end he could be rising from the throne [Music] called children home and wants to save yours left to stay and there'll be no sacrifice for men no more Mercy when he's gone there's no one else run to Jesus while there's time and don't you be left behind he could be rising from the throne oh we've heard at times and time again since I was just a little boy or that the Lord would come again you those Redeemed by that precious lamb [Music] but those are left behind away [Music] soon we'll learn to their mistake listen friends oh the curtains coming down when no mercy will be found he could be rising from the throne he could rising from the throne [Music] oh save yours left to stand there'll be no sacrifice for men no more [Music] run to Jesus while there's times friend don't be left behind he could be rising from the throne praise praise God don't you sing this with us [Music] it's crazy

[Applause] [Music] thank you well are you doing the presence of the Lord this morning I said it last night I said it last night now we've sung a lot better and actually I've actually hit my notes a lot better but I tell you what I've enjoyed singing here as much as I have anywhere we've ever been fact Tim and then we're talking about how much they enjoyed singing here we see for an audience that that's smiling that receives what you're you're singing about you know it makes you it's like a preacher and I'm not a preacher but I could I'm going to talk to you this morning but you know we all have a Ministry every one of us now uh I don't I don't preach all of my sermons are three minutes long in songs I said that's how I preach my sermons but I want to go back this morning and I just want to share a few things with you that how some people want to know how you wrote that song how you wrote that song and what what brought you to where you're at well everything that's happened in my life up until this point and your life as well as it brought you to where you are today the good the bad the ugly the ugliest it's all brought you to where you are today turn to somebody and tell them God's brought me a long way would you do that hey man I want to uh yeah just turn this stand up shake somebody saying let's just let's just be home today praise God that'll sip your head up and thank the Lord for bringing you that far with glasses well we're all relaxed and comfortable I'll try I'll try not to speak three hours I will speak over 35 40 minutes so uh but I don't want to read a scripture because you know the brother Branham said if you want to get close to the Lord read your Bible and pray every day and so I don't think it would be appropriate if I didn't do this uh and this is some of my favorite scriptures Jeremiah 29 11 through 13 for I know the thoughts that I have toward you saith the Lord thoughts of peace and not of evil to give you an expected end then shall you call upon me and he shall go and pray unto me and I will hearken unto you and you shall seek me and find me when you search me with your whole heart amen then over in Ephesians I want to read a little portion there Ephesians chapter 2 1-5 it says and you happy quickened who were dead and transpasses and sins well that's all that was me for sure we're in in times past you walked according to the course of this world according to the prince of the power of the air the spirit that now worketh in the children of Disobedience among whom also we all had our conversation in times past the lust of our flesh fulfilling the desires of the Flesh and of the mind and we're by Nature the children of rap even as others here's what I want to speak today but God who is rich in Mercy for his great love we're with he loved us even when we were dead in our sins has quickened us and to get together with Christ by grace are you saved can we just say a big Amen to that I want to start with a H I asked the Lord two things and I told Brother John I said I've asked the Lord for two things I don't cry because I'm so ugly when I cry and you don't want to see that and I said Lord please don't let me be boring so if I look around and you're picking Lynn off your clothes looking down the floor I won't think man I'm boring damn damn so if I'm bored you just smile and act like I'm not my birthplace began my existence here on this Earth began in 1959 I was born and now the hospitals back then they didn't have the all their fine amenities and you know all the equipment they have today and you know sometimes I know there's some people here my senior and sometimes they would there would be three or four women in one room they just have a curtain anybody ever seen a hospital like that just have a curtain separating the patients well when I was born and I'm told I wasn't I wasn't planned my dad had five kids mom had five kids he was having a hard enough time feeding them and so he didn't really want me along the way so but I came anyway because your name's on the lounge Book of Life you got to come to Earth but my mom was in the hospital we were they were so poor and I I was born into a real poor family and uh we you know we're not talking about uh we're talking about two room houses and in the middle of the room was a big old light bulb he had a long cord you pulled down the young people have no clue what I'm talking about anybody ever pulled a long stream cord turned the light on yeah did that every all the time that's you know and I was such a small fellow I was in the dark list somebody was brown taller than me but there was six kids but when I was in the hospital my mother loved chocolates and I don't know why but Tim mccale and Vicki I don't have to say Amen but I'll eat chocolate lunch dinner I ate chocolate all the time I love chocolate anybody like chocolates I do too but while she's in the hospital there was a curtain that separated her from another woman and they had a baby and so uh they were just sitting there you know sometimes you pull the curtain back and just talk and they were sitting there and uh the nurse walked in and said Miss Terry that was a lady sitting inside my mom and she said I got a gift for you and she walked in she watched my mother watch her unwrap this beautiful box of chocolates immediately instead of the woman saying oh that's wonderful she said what was he thinking he knows I'm a diabetic and I can't eat chocolate why in the world was he thinking and my mom was laying there she was just like craving that box of chocolates but she didn't say nothing in that afternoon when my dad came in they talked a few minutes and he said well didn't you get the gift she said why gifts and he said you know the chocolates the lady pulled the curtain back said oh no oh no that was for you and not me see my name's Terry and then dropped the other part of the note and just said Miss Terry and they give it to her so from that point things got started off kind of kind of complicated in my life early but that was the most innocent one but anyway I came home and there was five kids and like I said we were real poor and anybody here now you're not going to believe this but we were I'm telling you how poor we were do you ever draw water from a whale anybody here I'm right at home anyway there were six kids and we lived on a there was a black top can I run it was just a gravel road really just blacktop really really raw country and you turn off this blacktop onto this uh dirt road wouldn't the gravel just dirt road and you go so far and you make a big U and we lived in a little two-room Shack and our heat was a big old pot belly stove right about the middle right out in the middle of the floor and you know you got hot on one side and you froze on the other but those are good days and uh you know this is a little house here that only had two rooms and you know in living rooms anybody ever had a bed in your living room we had beds in our living room because we had there was two rooms and there was six kids but when Mama get up in the mornings and I didn't want to get up I was the smallest one it should say get up Terry we gotta walk the kids to the to the bus stop so we'll get up I'd get up and would walk the kids to the bus stop and on the way home Mom would stop and and should get a if the well was about 500 feet from us and she would she would dip that big old bucket down in the well and pull it out and I'd have to carry that one pail back it was almost all I could do but that was the kind of that's how I started out and I didn't know we're poor because everybody in our hauler was poor but you know what the first time I ever had an encounter with God was it five years old in that little house we were out playing now there are six kids and it's on a beautiful sunny day summer and we we made up our toys we didn't I hear kids today I'm so bored I don't have nothing to do and they got all these Electronics they've got all these gidgets not we've made our toys with sticks and we went through the woods a piece of stick riding that car but we had nothing to do uh because mama called a sin she's because everybody heard her say it's coming to Cloud it's coming up the cloud that's why they said back where I was from that only means it's fixing the rain so it was a beautiful day we were all out playing it started to rain and mama called all of us kids in and we were sitting there six kids in a two bedroom a two-room house after a while we got on Mama's nerves really bad and so she said why we said mom we don't have nothing to do she said why don't y'all just go in the living room which was where we're at and say why don't y'all just gather around and y'all pray because my brother Kenny and Sandra didn't have any and said why don't y'all pray that the Lord will send them some shoes and so you know we were just kids we all gathered around in the middle of the floor and we began to pray we just said a simple prayer I was just listening because I was so young but we prayed Lord would you please send my brother and sister pair of shoes you quit raining we went on outside and started playing somewhere around almost dark mama called hollered to call of his kids in and we were just came in the house when there was a car coming down coming off pulled off off the blacktop it was coming down our road well we knew if it passed this one house it was come on down to us it was coming to see us so my mama waited until it passed that house she's oh they're coming here they're coming here now we didn't have no cell phone no telephones uh old timey washer you know you get your hand called in it and I'd see my mama cry but you know we didn't have anything and so when she opened the door a few minutes later there stood Brother Gibson now Brother Gibson was a man who had converted my data from the Nazarene Church he was um he was a precious saint of God and Harry sit at the door and when my mom opened the door she noticed she had three or four big boxes in his hands and she said well come on in and he said no sister Tim I can't I can't come in he said you know it's already late and he's not gonna get back he lived about an hour and a half away he said but today while I was praying the Holy Ghost spoke to me and said go buy the table kids shoes my mother began to cry and not only were there two pair of shoes but all six kids Got a Brand New Pair of Shoes [Applause] now that was the first that was the first miracle that I've seen as a boy and it hooked something down in my soul because I know we just prayed for it I knew we had no telephone he had no idea of our situation but I'll tell you God still speaks like that things got a little better and we moved it to a a little bigger house it had a it had a rayon heat in the wall and it had water and man we were Uptown it was even brick now I'll go back now and look at that huge house and it shrunk so much it's such a little house but to us it was a big house and you know people talk about they were raised in the you know four four kids in the four broom house in the bath we were raising two two rooms in the path anybody know what that is and so uh but uh but times got better and and Diddy built his house and then he started to build a church right beside of our house and there's a big old Brickell block Church similar to this not as big but similar to this and then one day uh I was out playing and uh my dad was preaching a Revival in Nashville which was about an hour and a half away he was preaching and uh I I was just playing around he was putting the shingles on the church you know and I I was out playing my brothers and sisters and uh my mama came out and she said uh Doris that's my dad's name said I have we have nothing left to eat another six kids and mama daddy she said I cooked the last cornmeal I fried the last potatoes she said we have no oil she started naming all this stuff and she started crying and I just looked up looked up at my dad I thought what is he going to say he said her name's Dorothy said Dorothy the Lord will provide and that's all he said is she said well Doris we don't have anything what she said he said the Lord will provide and he just kept on him and the nail and nailing the shingles that night we went to church it's the Pentecostal church we were Pentecostal went to the Pentecostal church and now back in that day at the end of the revivals you know sometimes I didn't get a whole lot of money so what they did is that everybody ever heard of a pounding okay you guys got to come South a pounding is when they get together and they just everybody brings groceries oh they bring tons of groceries and so at the end of the close of the Revival I just heard what my mom had said to my dad that day we went on to churches I mean it was you know I was a kid it's like nothing but at the end of the service the preacher says all mine's clear but nobody said that and so he said well brother table the offerings were kind of will kind of support this wig wouldn't very much he said but I want you to know here we took you all up a pound and opened a Sunday school door and I've never seen as much food in my life it looked like three Kroger stuck in one room it was summertime so there was bushels of beans corns potatoes onions and they bought all kind of good stuff you know from the cookies and stuff we had a station wagon we sit on food we held food and we tied food to the top of the house at top of the car brother and when we got home we started loading it all off off the other car into the table we had a little table with just a wooden four-legged table and we kept loading groceries and all at once that table went to come fell flat to the ground I'd hear my daddy preach a few years after it he'd say didn't the Lord say he would give you a blessing he just wouldn't be able to receive that's what happened that day and I you know it just kind of it made me it made me realize man this God that my daddy's preaching about it it's that this is real this is a real stuff we had a lady and I'll move on this from this we had a lady that came to the church she was a regularly rather large lady she always wore a hat and uh we never she never seen him without her hat now my wife wears that I see her sometimes she likes hats but this lady was about well she was large and she was short and it should come to church and I'm gonna go with my mom I would go with my mom to pick her up because she had no way to church her husband was an atheist and he was very mean and hit her and you know just just was a terrible person but she'd get in the car and would pick her up and one one morning we went to pick her up I said Mama who's that man there and she said that's that's uh I'll just change the name because I know you're going on YouTube he said I'll just say sister Smith said that's a sister Smith's husband and I said well why don't he come to church she said she's Sister Sister someone told her name sister Smith was fixing to get in the car and Mom said no no I'll tell you later but this lady would come to church If he if she had no way she'd start out walking and we live three or four miles from church and she didn't miss church sometimes she'll come in that'd be raining her face you could see with the snow would hit her face and should sit down and my daddy would begin to sing a song called oh Lord you've been so good to me and he would start singing and I noticed she would she was a large lady so she should take her hands and she'll just cut patent the seat and then a few minutes later she started doing this and she was so such a large lady pretty soon the tears were flowing and she was going like this she was just and I always wondered and you know the spirit was all over the church and I always wondered how because somebody whose husband beat her who uh wouldn't wouldn't would cuss her out every time she walked out the door to go to church how could she be so faithful and how could she cry when Daddy saying oh Lord you've been so good to me it took a few years later but I found out what what made her cry because she was in love with God more than she was in love with anything else praise God the solo church we had a and this is it was just small and we didn't have very many people come by Brother John we was too far out off the track for them to come but every now and then there'd be a preacher that'd come by and this part is important now because it's amoeba you'll understand a little bit later on I went up to get prayer at the end of the end of the service and uh I remember the preacher he was he was a young guy he was from out west you know that was really big to us it was like millions of miles away but when he prayed for me I started to turn around and walk off and then he said little boy and I stopped he said are you be a good little boy and you obey your mom and daddy he said because when you get older the Lord's going to use you and I thought I'd never been out of the County uh how is it going to use me of course I couldn't really understand what he's saying he said you have a Ministry that will affect many nations and so my mom and daddy thought I was going to be a preacher oh they just Terry's gonna preach and I'd get in trouble and get mean or get revised I said Son you better you better buy that calling you know you know you better do what God's told you to do but instead of making me uh instead of making me want to do I started running from that and I just I didn't we we sung and I'd go sing and then about 12 or 13. I became real rebellious young boys always over by your mom and daddy always do what they say but I become real rebellious and the more the more that the Lord would speak to me that son you know you remember that little Sunday night our Sunday morning you remember that you know that preacher and I would just turn to rock music up louder just I just tried to drown it out and I got I got to the point where I got so disobedient one day I ran away from home and stayed gone for two or three days and finally came back just just just do it Opposite from what God did asked me to do and that's why I could say God's rich and mercy one night and I want to say this for the young people one night I was working in a fast food restaurant and the manager said uh Terry when we get through working tonight we're closing the store so we'll get through working he said we're having a party in my house and so I said okay that's that's good I'll come over he said we won't have a party he said so we're gonna have the good stuff I didn't know what good stuff meant I just was going to the party but when uh when I got to the party we were sitting around the table and somebody brought out joints and uh you know I never been high or anything like that I know there's people here may have experienced that but uh I'm sitting at the table and they passed the joint in the God said we passed it around I just take a pool take a pull and I knew better I knew something inside was said boy you're in the wrong place doing the wrong thing and I was there and all at once they brought the snoo joint out and they said now everybody just take a real small pull on this one but I was going to be cool because I I didn't feel anything brother John it's just just sitting there so I started to smoke this joint and when I I took a big draw off of it handed it to the person beside me and would come back around to me I took another big draw off of it well when I started to hand it to the next person I blacked out I didn't know where I was at I didn't know what was going on and all I could see was commotion I could see people saying that the rock music was blaring they said turn it turn turn the music now turn the music down they turned the music down and I could see him I it was this most horrible feeling what they didn't tell me what I didn't know at the time is it they had they would sprinkle it with angel dust and I didn't know I was my parents were out of town preaching here I am thinking about well I'm partying down and here I am now in the room and I heard him say he's he's OD and man he's OD and he's he's on a trip he's on a trip I couldn't say anything I just seemed emotion I just seen what was going on and I was begging everything in my heart and my mind because I couldn't say anything I was saying Lord please please don't let me die like this please don't let me die like this because I knew that uh it'd be a horrible thing for my parents to have to deal with and I and I didn't want to go to hell and I said please God hours and hours went and they they got me they made me get in the shower fully clothed put cold water on me they did everything they could to try to bring me down make me drink coffee I got up to go to go out the door I was going trying to go through the wall never ever ever get messed up with the account of drugs and I told the Lord I said Lord if you would deliver me and let me come back in my right mind I promise you I will never ever touch drugs again so I I couldn't I couldn't go home so they carried me to my sister's house and they just put me to bed and I slept I slept for slipping off for up to three days but for the next seven or eight months I could be standing talking to you and I'd have a I like going to start to go on a trip and I would like not see you not know who you were and then in the moment's time I'd come back and I and that's are you okay you okay but I said God if you'll just give me back my mind and I got so depressed after that because I got tired of not knowing where I was going to be what I was going to be doing I could be all at once just talking like we are now my mind would just leave I become suicidal and one day I got up and I told my mom I said I can't do this anymore I told her what had happened and see they couldn't they couldn't report me back then or take me to the hospital because I was only 17 they were all adults and I told her what had happened I told her she said well Terry I know something's wrong she said I know something's wrong you're not acting right son you're not acting right so I told her I said I've been I've been having these flashbacks for months and I said I just can't do this no more mama she said well without the have you committed or we're gonna have to get prayer for you so I said well she said you want me to call a preacher to pray for you I said yes yes ma'am so she went out with the cord the phone that hung on the wall had the real long cord you just go outside she went outside and she was talking to somebody she came back in and she said it here Terry this preacher wants to talk to you and when I answered the phone he said hello brother dear and I recognize right off anybody heard of brother Junior Jackson here I've heard from the junior Jackson Raymond Jackson he said Son your mama told me you're you're having some bad thoughts and then she said uh she told me that you know you're you're really in bad shape and I said yes sir I said um I need I need help he said well you know I'm going to pray for you he said and you're going to believe with me are you son and I'm desperate I said yes I'm going to believe with you he said when I get through praying he said Do You Believe God's going to take all these thoughts away from me I said yes sir yes sir I do so he prayed for me I I don't know how y'all call it but he prayed he shelled it right down to the cob I mean he was praying when he got off the phone I didn't feel much different I still felt suicidal I felt like giving up but the very next day I woke up things were lighter I didn't have that suicide feeling or that down feeling like I wanted to hurt myself within a week I was back to me and I promised the Lord I said now that's one promise I never I broke a lot of promises that's one promise you know folks I never ever ever went back home never touched drugs again we were we at the little church uh we had I I kind of let this out and I want to bring this in and my sister Kay she was 12 years old she would had a bad ear infection in her ears and she and she got sicker and sicker and sicker and sicker not only the doctors told her my parents that we don't know what's wrong with your your daughter uh but we know this that her ear drum one ear drum is almost completely gone the other's now starting to disappear and she's having migraines in and out of the hospital throwing up running high fevers and they spent all they could do trying to get her well one day my uncle came over and he said I tell you what he said it and that's my I told my mom it's his sister brother Branham is going to be in Birmingham Alabama I believe if you'll take Kay down there I believe God will heal her and so uh daddy that that had all of all the Pentecostal preachers had already prayed for and she couldn't she hadn't gotten no better so um they decided to take her decorated here see brother Branham and so my mom my dad my uncle and aunt and took my little sister our big sister took her to uh Birmingham brother Brandon preached in the Armory there and my dad said when uh now he had heard of brother Branham he had heard it now he was a Pentecostal preacher but he heard brother Brandon was a good man and had great Miracles and you know that's that's just that was the extent of what he knew of brother Branham but he said that when I walked in the arena there armored there armor building he said it was just like regular service and everybody trying to get in everybody and said when they finally got in they said uh the service was just normal nothing different it said then uh brother Branham walked out and said good evening friends my dad said I began to cry he said I looked over at my Mama she's crying he said I started looking around and everybody in the audience was crying he said the very presence of that man who walked on the platform was different from any man that I'd ever ever seen and he said he just simply said good evening friends and and he preached a sermon a powerful sermon the next night he preached the next day Sunday at two he preached again and my sister got a prayer card and so she was at the end of the service as brother Branham as you know did he called for the prayer cards to come up they called out the numbers my sister got called and she was standing there in the line and she's only 12 years old she's just a little girl and I've asked her so many times I'd say how did that feel coming up to brother Brown to pray for you she said all I know is you know then had preachers pray for her and that and and this is this is fine I mean that would just holler real loud and that shout and screaming that's fun I mean I'm I'm hyper myself but brother Putnam didn't do that he just he said come here young lady she walked up to him he didn't even didn't even lay his hand on her head he just pulled her up to his side and said I adjure you in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ to take your hands off of this little girl Satan she walked back to her seat went back to the doctor oh he she said okay how are you here now that ear she said I hear you just fine he stopped up the other so how are you here now this year you can't hear said your eardrum's gone and you only have part of one she said I here's just fine from that time on she'd never had another problem she never had another fever never was put in never went back to the hospital so that's how we first started brother random and so his voice became very familiar at our house but uh I've often wondered I said okay what did you think would you when he you walked up to him she said all I know Terry is I was going to get healed and she lives about 20 20 minutes from us right now she's all she's just as good as never had no more problems with that I tell you God is a wonderful God well I repented after I got on the drugs I said Lord you know I can't I just can't live this life and I repented and we started back singing and uh came in one afternoon and I sat down and I wrote a song and it was called in the in the Garden of Eden the human race began when God took the dust from the earth and made a man he told him to multiply on Earth to complete his plan can you imagine just how he felt when the nails went through his hands so I wrote that and finished the song my dad came in I said dad I wrote a song today so that was the first song I ever wrote in my dad said son that's a good song there and so we started singing that song and we continue to sing and then uh I went down to Georgia now like I said last night I went down to Georgia and I got her and she didn't ask me to marry I asked her to marry me and we got married and uh it wasn't maybe two years to three years after we were married I I came home one day we came out from work one day and think he was sick now she's she's one of those people have never threw up that's just you just don't get sick like that and so she was about to throw up and I said honey what's wrong with you she said I don't know I don't know I'm just sick well we found out she's gonna have another a little baby and we were so excited and we uh she carried the baby up she started getting the toxemia about six seven months and then she swelled up her hand swelled her face fell swelled her feet swelled and we went and sung one weekend on the way back she started she started having more issues I got up and went on to work the next morning we were just young and we're happy and excited and I got a phone call about the middle of the day and it was my sister said Terry you need to come to the hospital right now he said you're having your baby today that's all she said so I told my boss I said okay we're having a baby and I was high-fiving on the way out and when I walked through a corridor and I walked into the room she wasn't there was no doctors there was no nurses there there's the room and she was laying there on the bed and she was kind of curled up and she was facing the wall and I said hey I'm here honey where's the baby I'm here and she didn't move I said where what's wrong and she slowly turned around and her she had cried so hard her eyes were kind of matted together just the baby didn't make it and so that really shook my life and I don't know if you've experienced Tim my son here it's we lost his baby two years ago it was like living it all over again but that shook my life that man I thought man why did that happen you know am I reaping what I saw do you know how the devil will come to you and just torment your mind and so I continued to write songs and we continue to sing and one day at church one night at church Vicki had went to church and I had to work and she's sitting way in the back of the building anybody ever heard of brother Billy Andrews brother Billy at the end of the service said sister Vicki and that was probably about 300 people there 250 300 sister Vicki would you stand up and she stood up and he said the Holy Spirit told me to tell you he's going to give you the desire of your heart anything you want stand up now look we already lost one baby seven eight eight months she got pregnant again we lost that one she got pregnant again we lost that one and it just it was like was ever going to have kids so she said Lord I just left in my hand and said you know I want a baby I want to be a mother nine months later that big tall thing came along right there wasn't long [Applause] wouldn't long after that that thing came and then they got another book that came and I went back to brother Andrew and said stop praying stop praying we have enough kids right now but we had one more girl into so that just goes to show you that God he's concerned about you no matter what he's concerned I uh my mom and dad were were the kind of Christians that um we trusted God I guess you know nothing wrong with going to doctors and Fields but they just just trusted God and just if we had a problem you know we just prayed and uh one one night the most unfortunate thing happened are y'all bored one of the most unfortunate thing happened I got a call with my mom and she said Terry I've got the doctor says I have cancer well that shook me to the core because you know my dad was a fake preaching uh believed in Miracles and not seen I've seen them myself and I thought well Mama it should be fine I mean you just don't you know it's gonna be fine well she got sicker they had to go in and do surgery on her and while she was in surgery my dad had a heart attack so she was on the third floor as I said he was on the seventh floor so we'd go in and see Dad and then we'll go in and go back down and see Mom and it was just a horrible time I thought man why is this happening then a good friend of mine brother Billy Andrews fell out of a tree and almost died so Vicky and I went to the hospital to see him and when we went uh I found a little plaque in the gift shop that said he will make this trial a blessing and I told Vic I said let's just get this for brother Andrews so we got it for him and he's going on and the family was so gracious not long ago to give the plaque back to us that would give him but he willed uh he wouldn't he came home he got okay but on uh one day I got to give it to him on a Saturday and on Monday all all weekend long he will make this child blessing we're just stuck in my head and I just couldn't get it out so I went to work and I started down and now driving no for forklift you all know what those are I jumped off that thing and I grabbed me a piece of paper off a slat and I wrote I'll just come into a valley like I've never been before I keep searching for a way out seems like padlocks are on the door oh there must be another Sunrise another Sunset that I'll see God will make this child a blessing that's the love he has for me it came as fast as I could write it and I wrote the course and I wrote the second verse and I thought man this is really going to be a good song because you know it just really touched me so we sung at several places but it never felt like it was finished if you're an author you know what I'm talking about if you're writing a book you you don't have that that it's just don't it's not finished we call it green if you're a writer but I wrote that song and we sang it and never felt like a had it finished but when I was standing in the hospital and mama was on the third floor daddy is on the seventh floor I was questioning God I said God why why would you let this happen to my parents I mean it's just hard for me to understand then my dad got out but my mom after several months and she began sicker and sicker and sicker finally I went up to the hospital and I'd still I stayed with her and I'd been there with her and we uh spent the hot spent the whole day with her I just went home I got a phone call about just about an hour after I got it in bed my sister said uh Terry Mama's blood pressure has dropped twice she said I'm scared I said well call me back if it drops again that wasn't five minutes you called me back said just drop it again so I jumped in the car and I raced to the hospital I remember walking up going up the stairs or the elevator and getting going down that long haul dreading walking in the drawer opened the door there was those big blue eyes looking at me that that picked me up that I remember that said y'all go in there and pray that the Lord is and give your Brothers sister shoes I just so many members was going through my mind and there she laid and uh I I just supporting long after the doctor came and said y'all need to call the family and one of the most hardest darkest times that I've ever been in in my life I don't know I don't mind telling you I was a mama's boy I got three Mama's Boys they're all Mama's Boys but I was real close to Mom I'd call her every day from work because it was long distance from my house I'd call and say hey how are you daddy doing well I was just sitting there she got worse and worse and finally all the family came in and the doctor come knocked on the door and he said hey if if y'all want to we'll put it on life support he said it may keep her another half a day or so well she was so weak she could hardly even move they already put oxygen on her but she motioned with her head for my sister to come back and my sister came back over and my mom she lifted up for oxygen got down my mom said I don't want that I want y'all to sing Amazing Grace and so we all walked back into the gathered around her bed there and my daddy began singing through many dangers told the snares I have already come was faith that brought me safe this far it is gracefully Beyond we sit around her bedside that night and I tell you what if I live to be a hundred I'd never forget that feeling at this presence of the Lord just swept in the room each one of us dealt down and told her by she told us bye and then she settled back in the bed and started raised her hands and start praising the Lord and then somewhere around two or three that morning maybe four because the sun was just starting to come up over the horizon I walked over looked out the window and there she'd pass you they let her stay in the room with us and I started thinking now I'm standing on the mountain I wasn't there yet but by faith I will get there looking back I can see when I was in the slowest Valley his strong hand was leading me oh it's good to see the sunshine and the face Sweet Victory God has made this child a blessing that's the love he has free I wrote that in about two months before Mama passed we went over to her house and she was she was up walking there she just went down fast so she was up walking and and we're just visiting that afternoon and she said let's get ready to leave and she said my brother and his wife and the kids were all there she said Terry if you if you'll you'll play I'll sing Oh that tore the heart out of me I said sure Mom I'll play and so she came over and sit right down on the piano right beside me and she picked up the book and I said what do you want to sing mama and she said she picked up the old hymn book she flipped she said let's sing this one let's just sing this song I love this song she started singing I care not today what tomorrow may bring it's Shadow or sunshine or rain for the Lord I know ruleth over everything and All My worry is vain I'm living by faith it was all I could do to sit on the piano with her and she flipped so let's think this one and then she started singing I can almost see the lights of home I thought my heart would break I thought Mom I can't do this no more she's not getting a clear voice and she's let's sing one more let's sing one more and the last song I ever heard my mama sing he started singing we read of a place that's called heaven it's made for the pure and the free these truths and God's word he has given how beautiful Heaven Must Be and it wasn't long after that she got to view heaven and all this splendor well you kept singing it was so hard for me to even focus on anything thank you it was hard for me to focus on anything because I was just tore to pieces and I just I told Vicky one day I said I'm gonna I'm gonna go riding I went to work and I just couldn't work I I went out and I sat in a car and said eat with all the other guys I'd go sit in my car and one day I was just really frustrated I was just thinking you know you know how you get some time you know we think well God owes us something or you know we at least tell me why you did this and but uh I went in the car and I sat down in my car and I was just really torn up and as soon as I sit down in my car I re turned the radio on and a choir was singing and I felt some presence and I know we all have to answer for what we say on that day and God knows this is the truth I felt the presence come in my truck and I felt somebody sit down beside me I didn't see nobody but the song started singing by and by when the morning comes when all God sinks we'll gather down the throne we'll tell the story we'll understand it better by and by and that was like God was speaking to me son just wait a few just a little longer I'll tell you and so I uh I just couldn't get over it and so one day I took off work and one day I told Vicky I'm gonna go riding and I don't know how y'all do but we didn't have we didn't have CDs back in we just had cassettes and so I started riding I pushed the cassette in the brother Brandon said he said I go out to Tucson he said and I'm not at home he said I come back to Jeffersonville I'm not at home I grabbed my pen I wrote there is the land I'm homesick for it though I've never seen it before I've got loved ones on the other Shore there is the land that's how I wrote that song not long ago maybe it's been two times every month every six or six months where the writers get a check you know it's not much but you get a little check for the songs that you wrote that other groups have recorded it and uh I just want to tell you guys here let you listen to this because you don't know what God's got in store for you I I went to the mailbox one day and I opened up the check from BMI broadcast music Incorporated and it was different than the other chicks had a paper staple to it it said International and then it said here's a list of the countries who've played your song and it listed 32 countries that had played my song I will make this child a blessing and I heard that little preacher said little boy you be good you obey your parents because you have a Ministry that'll speak to many nations and that that I that prophecy was fulfilled It Ever Was to preach but it was to sing and write the songs so God if God can use me he can use you his grace is good for me it's good for you and I want the family to come back we want to sing a I want to sing a couple more songs but that's that's how I started writing some folks say I wish you'd write another God will make this child a blessing well you go through the trial and I'll write it for you because you know it's easy it's easy to sing them but it sometimes it's very hard to uh to write him can we just give the Lord a big campus of Grace [Applause] thank you I have seen some pretty towns yes you could say I've been around I found no place to settle down oh but there is foreign [Music] yes I'm tolling through a world of fear my time to leave I'll go to that Lake I want everybody to sing it with us [Music] there is homesick for though I never seen it before I've got loved ones they're waiting on that Shore there is [Music] away worlds and Falls

riding oh oh How I Love Jesus would you sing that with us [Music] [Music] [Music] Jesus I feel his presence this morning because oh me if you came this morning and maybe you're fighting the person maybe there's a problem you have that no one knows anything about it you put a smile on your face and you just keep going but if there's anything you need from God this morning I believe he's here this morning I won't ask that brother martin to come up to here to the front and if you have anything you need God to do just get it fixed up this morning if you don't know him I tell you what he's better he's better than anything that ever happened to you and he can fill you with the Holy Ghost this morning let's sing this keeps saying now come up if you need prayer oh [Music] I love Jesus
