[24:46] amen hallelujah amen well i do
[24:51] is mercy rule all my life
[24:55] hallelujah we should always have
[24:58] some sort of testimony amen sometimes we
[25:01] don't think about it but
[25:02] it doesn't take too long in god's
[25:04] presence before you realize
[25:07] i got a testimony hallelujah sister
[25:12] linda
[25:14] young man at my house
[25:32] yeah i'd like to share a little one i
[25:33] mean we've been having some
[25:35] you know every service is a great
[25:37] service you can't just pick one out of
[25:39] the other ones because everything's
[25:40] god's word right so
[25:42] don't add one word don't take one word
[25:43] from it right but we had a service on do
[25:46] it
[25:46] you know just go out and do it you know
[25:48] just start putting
[25:49] things aside and things that would stop
[25:52] you from doing it and just
[25:53] go out and do it you know don't let that
[25:55] devil because you know he has a million
[25:57] excuses right
[25:59] and um my days at work are fairly short
[26:03] and not that that should change anything
[26:05] but i figured you know
[26:07] like like the prophet said if i'm going
[26:09] to do something for a guy god do it now
[26:11] and so
[26:14] i know sometimes i feel like i just
[26:17] received lord
[26:18] you know how you you you come in the
[26:20] lord and you're like on fire and you're
[26:22] just like boom
[26:23] you're out there and uh i think that's
[26:26] the way
[26:26] it should be right so i talked to a
[26:29] gentleman at work and
[26:31] you know he's asked me a few questions i
[26:33] sat down for
[26:34] 45 minutes and just gave him the gospel
[26:38] and we just prayed that his name's sean
[26:42] and that he would just heed the call
[26:44] because
[26:46] you know like i told him i said i don't
[26:47] know if this is your day of visitation
[26:49] but
[26:50] we all have one um only the lord knows
[26:53] that
[26:54] but heed the call if it is because
[26:58] um his coming is nigh and
[27:01] uh i truly believed he he was filled
[27:04] with
[27:05] the spirit of christ and we just pray
[27:08] that i can just keep nurturing that
[27:10] and many more amen as the day approaches

[35:50] god has done a tremendous work in this
[35:53] name

[36:06] sirs is this the time he got
[36:10] to the end and you know the people are
[36:13] worshiping and
[36:15] praising god at the end of the service
[36:17] and he said do you love him
[36:19] and oh yeah he said be sure of that
[36:24] and then he repeated that he says be
[36:26] real sure of that
[36:28] that you're in love with god not the
[36:31] pastor
[36:32] not the church not brother branham god
[36:40] bless you good to see everybody

[37:04] tonight drove all this distance just to
[37:06] hear hear stuff that they've heard for
[37:08] the last three or four weeks months
[37:12] but if god adds his blessing it'll be
[37:15] worth it
[37:17] that's the whole idea is and god will
[37:19] and his blessing if we
[37:21] get ourselves out of the way first kings
[37:24] chapter 19
[37:25] if you would in your scriptures first

[37:42] don't know what's going to happen we
[37:44] don't know
[37:45] all the things that have happened and
[37:47] will happen
[37:49] but i think in psalms 22 122 david said
[37:52] i was glad when they said unto me
[37:54] let us go to the house of the lord
[37:59] we don't know what tomorrow holds

[38:04] know what what this whole situation is
[38:06] going to unfold to
[38:08] uh first kings 19 or yeah first kings 19
[38:13] first one and ahab told jezebel
[38:18] all that elijah had done and with all
[38:21] how he had slain
[38:22] all the prophets with the sword then
[38:25] jezebel sent a messenger
[38:27] unto elijah saying so
[38:30] let the gods do to me and more also
[38:33] if i make not thy life as the life of
[38:36] one of them
[38:37] by tomorrow about this time
[38:41] and when he saw that he arose and went
[38:45] for his
[38:46] life and came to beersheba which
[38:49] belongeth to judah and left his servant

[39:17] endlessly and it's not always
[39:22] well regarded it's not always as
[39:24] fruitful as we would like to see it
[39:28] but god you look upon our hearts

[39:35] family bless this assembly

[42:28] stink
[42:33] the next day i was a little hard instead

[42:42] secret was
[42:43] just keep bathing just keep bathing in
[42:46] that presence of god

[42:56] brother branham was up on the indian

[50:54] is god by his sovereign grace amen
[50:57] before the foundation of the world
[50:59] electing you
[51:05] amen breathe ezekiel
[51:09] 16 this week it's
[51:12] 60 70 some verses but it's good reading
[51:16] because god walked by israel
[51:21] israel was laying there a baby
[51:24] unwashed just born still had the
[51:26] umbilical cord
[51:28] laying there
[51:31] anything could have taken its life
[51:33] anything could have destroyed it
[51:36] and god the holy god
[51:39] saw israel laying in her own blood
[51:42] laying there in her nativity
[51:44] and he walked by and he said live
[51:50] wow he got entered into a covenant
[51:53] with israel it wasn't israel's choice
[51:56] it wasn't because israel had signed in
[51:59] the you know where do i sign up for this
[52:03] god by his grace chose don't you
[52:06] ever speak against the jew
[52:12] if you don't have nothing good to say
[52:13] don't say anything you're gonna cause
[52:15] yourself more trouble
[52:18] the jews are god's chosen people we were
[52:20] the ones grafted in
[52:23] [Laughter]
[52:25] thank god for the grafting process thank
[52:27] god that
[52:29] he gave us something
[52:32] to hold us
[52:35] oh my goodness brother john can i come
[52:38] back three or four more times
[52:40] i just
[52:46] he told israel he saw her in her
[52:48] nativity
[52:50] covered with blood laying there not even
[52:52] a blanket on her
[52:54] he said live and then he entered a
[52:56] covenant
[52:58] he said i'm going to be with you no
[53:00] matter where you go no matter what you
[53:01] do
[53:03] but the story got kind of sad
[53:06] because israel began to look in the
[53:09] mirror
[53:10] whoa she's a pretty good looking old gal
[53:14] she began to trust in herself
[53:19] she began to limit god
[53:25] she began to commit whoredoms
[53:29] but she's getting pretty rank she
[53:32] totally turned her back on god
[53:36] but you know god he's the one that
[53:39] started that covenant
[53:41] it wasn't because of israel's goodness
[53:44] it wasn't because
[53:44] israel bought a certain parcel with
[53:47] money
[53:48] it's because god rich in mercy chose her
[53:52] same way he chose you before the
[53:55] foundation of the world it's not your
[53:57] goodness
[54:02] she committed hardems she did everything
[54:05] wrong
[54:06] could be done wrong read the read the
[54:09] chapter
[54:11] you get toward the very last god said
[54:15] nevertheless i know what you did
[54:19] i know you were a bad girl i know you
[54:22] but i
[54:22] am going to save your soul amen
[54:27] because i entered into that covenant
[54:31] with you without you even saying
[54:32] anything it was
[54:34] my idea and i'm going to make sure it
[54:36] works
[54:45] what about the blood of jesus
[54:48] brother sister don't you
[54:52] ever leave sight of calvary
[54:56] if your religion takes you so far that
[54:58] you don't see the blood anymore
[55:00] you better make sure you better back up
[55:02] and track your steps better
[55:05] because it has to go past the cross it
[55:07] has to go
[55:08] past that supreme sacrifice
[55:15] here's elijah running
[55:22] three and a half years chapter 17 no
[55:25] rain
[55:27] he said elijah go down to the brook
[55:29] tariff i'ma feed you
[55:31] with the ravens drink from the brook
[55:34] three and a half years kind of not bad
[55:38] i could do that after a while
[55:43] the brook began to dry up because it was
[55:47] his word
[55:48] that he spoke
[55:53] right in the will of god
[55:57] the brook dried up there's times
[56:02] our brooks dry up there's times we have
[56:04] troubles
[56:05] there's times don't
[56:08] look at the promise look who stood
[56:11] philippians 1 6 being confident
[56:14] of this very thing that he which hath
[56:18] h-a-t-h began a good work in you
[56:21] will perform it not could perform it
[56:24] will perform it

[56:27] can but he not only can

[56:46] discouraged i got this bill
[56:49] let me carry a bill
[56:58] not our doing it's god rich in his mercy
[57:01] that wrote our names i was sitting there
[57:05] in my front yard the other day and i
[57:06] watched this little thistle seed
[57:08] go you never see the little dandelion
[57:10] seeds they go flame through the air
[57:13] and in the little milkweed seeds and
[57:17] and the thistle seeds and all the
[57:19] different
[57:20] seeds flying they come
[57:24] from the east and west
[57:27] they come from the lands afar
[57:31] you and i by the grace of almighty god
[57:35] we've come from here come from that
[57:37] background come from that place
[57:39] come from that god in mercy
[57:42] has already predestinated us
[57:45] to be a child of god in this day
[57:56] john 15.
[58:07] john 15
[58:11] verse 16.
[58:15] ye have not chosen me
[58:24] i got a phone call today you know some
[58:26] guy you know
[58:27] endorsing somebody
[58:41] choosing us he chose us before the world
[58:45] was ever created
[58:46] he chose us
[58:51] you have not chosen me but i
[58:54] have chosen you and ordained you
[58:57] that you should bring forth fruit and
[58:59] that your fruit should remain
[59:01] that whatsoever you shall ask my father
[59:03] my name he may give it to you
[59:08] he chose you he chose us
[59:13] elijah was chosen
[59:16] i
[59:24] but yet god had a plan
[59:31] moses he chose
[59:34] to serve god i think it kind of
[59:38] the fruit doesn't fall too far from the
[59:40] tree god chose us
[59:43] now it's our turn to choose him
[59:47] what are we going to do with this jesus
[59:50] called christ
[59:52] hebrews 11
[59:57] hebrews 11 24
[1:00:00] by faith moses when he was come to years
[1:00:04] refused to be called a methodist
[1:00:23] i believe god
[1:00:39] they heard about the angel of the lord
[1:00:43] the miracles of god the visions
[1:00:48] they said we're going to jeffersonville

[1:02:11] had the world by the tail
[1:02:26] and i played three different sports in
[1:02:28] high school i thought
[1:02:30] man they're playing tough i said
[1:02:33] okay i'll go
[1:02:37] you don't have to tell me god sent a
[1:02:38] prophet
[1:02:41] we got there to the tabernacle when he
[1:02:44] preached the anointed ones at the end
[1:02:46] time 1965 july 25th
[1:02:50] every door of that tabernacle had a
[1:02:52] crowd around it two hours before service
[1:02:58] kind of like you know message churches
[1:03:00] today everybody gathers
[1:03:01] early and
[1:03:06] appreciate brother bill
[1:03:15] i'll tell you what if brother random is
[1:03:17] here every one of these front seats will
[1:03:18] be full
[1:03:19] everyone you know we set way in the back
[1:03:23] we did oh well you know
[1:03:24] that's just profile patient that's good
[1:03:30] that's just meddling now i'm just good
[1:03:33] that's right
[1:03:36] that's no respecter person why should we
[1:03:37] be
[1:03:42] when they open them doors
[1:03:45] hundreds of people i didn't even get to
[1:03:49] sit
[1:03:50] with brother bob sister milly every
[1:03:53] every chair was full in 10 seconds
[1:03:55] seemed like
[1:03:58] where'd they go oh there they are
[1:04:02] and i'll tell you what every time
[1:04:05] brother branham
[1:04:06] looked at me i put my head down
[1:04:10] i was scared i'm telling i was scared to
[1:04:15] i thought that's a prophet of god and
[1:04:18] probably the holy spirit was just
[1:04:19] sitting right there get him
[1:04:20] get him he's yours
[1:04:28] you don't have to convince me that god
[1:04:30] sent a prophet but but
[1:04:34] be careful there's a ditch
[1:04:37] on both sides if everything you say well
[1:04:40] the prophet
[1:04:41] be careful brother branham said the
[1:04:45] prophet of the hour
[1:04:46] is the holy ghost the prophet
[1:04:50] of the hour is the who did brother
[1:04:52] branham rely on
[1:04:54] the holy ghost amen
[1:05:00] if you get it right it was
[1:05:03] malachi 4 it was a gift of healing
[1:05:06] it was revelation 10 7 it was
[1:05:10] an anointing right from god amen
[1:05:21] yeah you just have to be careful
[1:05:24] find the balance if it
[1:05:27] it has to bring glory not to william
[1:05:30] branham
[1:05:31] but to the lord jesus christ
[1:05:38] by faith moses when he was come the
[1:05:40] years refused to be called
[1:05:42] the son of pharaoh's daughter choosing
[1:05:44] rather to suffer affliction with the
[1:05:46] people of god
[1:05:48] choosing rather to suffer affliction
[1:05:52] with the people of god than to enjoy the
[1:05:54] pleasure of sin for a season
[1:05:57] esteeming the reproach of christ greater
[1:06:00] riches than the treasures in egypt
[1:06:02] for he had respect unto the recompense
[1:06:04] of the reward
[1:06:06] by faith he forsook egypt not fearing
[1:06:08] the wrath of the king
[1:06:10] for he endured as seeing him who was
[1:06:14] invisible exodus 3
[1:06:18] let's look at a little bit of moses in
[1:06:21] his choosing process now remember
[1:06:23] saints
[1:06:27] moses was a real man of god
[1:06:34] at the end of service today tab was
[1:06:36] playing that song he hideth my soul
[1:06:40] he passed by he let me see he let moses
[1:06:44] see the back to him
[1:06:45] he put his hand over him
[1:06:48] and as much as moses was used
[1:06:53] because of his disobedience god
[1:06:57] would not let him go into the promised
[1:06:58] land
[1:07:00] what a what a lesson that should be to
[1:07:02] all of us
[1:07:05] well i've been in this message 50 years
[1:07:06] well i'm glad to hear that
[1:07:09] that's good but your temper
[1:07:14] and yesterday i saw what were you doing
[1:07:16] what what are you reading that stuff for
[1:07:18] what are you looking at that what's the
[1:07:19] matter with you
[1:07:21] that's good
[1:07:25] when god
[1:07:28] tries to remind us tries to speak to us
[1:07:38] exodus 3 1. now moses kept the flock of
[1:07:42] jethro his father-in-law the priesthood
[1:07:43] midian
[1:07:44] he led the flock to the backside of the
[1:07:46] desert and came
[1:07:47] to the mountain of god even to horeb
[1:07:54] and the angel of the lord appeared unto
[1:07:56] him in a flame of fire
[1:08:00] does your bible say that the angel of
[1:08:03] the lord
[1:08:04] appeared unto him in a flame of fire out
[1:08:07] of the midst of a bush
[1:08:09] he looked and behold the bush burned
[1:08:11] with fire and the bush was not consumed
[1:08:13] and moses said
[1:08:14] i will now turn aside
[1:08:18] there's a lot of things we need to turn
[1:08:19] aside from
[1:08:23] you can't serve the world and god
[1:08:26] at the same time paul said you've got to
[1:08:30] take off
[1:08:31] the old man before you can put on the
[1:08:34] new yeah
[1:08:36] some of my boys they were going to
[1:08:38] school
[1:08:40] so they thought just to save time
[1:08:42] they'll wear their pajamas under their
[1:08:44] clothes
[1:08:46] you know they started looking kind of
[1:08:48] lumpy
[1:08:51] and they started smelling kind of funny
[1:08:54] don't try to put the new one until you
[1:08:56] take the old one off
[1:08:59] it's not you accepting the holy ghost
[1:09:04] it's the holy ghost accepting you
[1:09:10] we'll never get good enough that's the
[1:09:12] truth
[1:09:15] remember that time he brother baptized
[1:09:19] doc uh what was his last name somebody
[1:09:22] help me
[1:09:24] anyhow he brother bannon was talking to
[1:09:27] him and he said well when i get good
[1:09:28] enough i'll
[1:09:29] he said doc god didn't come to save the
[1:09:32] good guys he came to save the bad guys
[1:09:36] and so brother brandon baptized him and
[1:09:39] some of his own
[1:09:40] people in the church criticized him for
[1:09:42] doing that because doc went out as soon
[1:09:43] as he baptized him went out and lit up a
[1:09:45] cigarette
[1:09:46] papa cox papa cox there you go papa cox
[1:09:49] thank you
[1:09:52] he went out lit up a cigarette
[1:09:55] i told you i told you the brothers
[1:09:57] [Music]
[1:09:59] we still got them
[1:10:08] i told you brother i told you brother
[1:10:09] john i told him
[1:10:11] if you don't listen to me
[1:10:16] look up now
[1:10:20] he baptized him anyhow
[1:10:23] cigarette breath on his on his breath
[1:10:26] he's still baptized he went out lit up
[1:10:28] right afterwards
[1:10:35] some of the things we need to turn aside
[1:10:36] from is
[1:10:38] criticism
[1:10:42] take this whole world but give me jesus
[1:10:45] i'm not here to
[1:10:46] i i don't want to offend you i don't
[1:10:48] want to offend nobody but i
[1:10:50] don't want to offend jesus
[1:10:53] above all
[1:10:58] said i will now turn aside and see this
[1:11:00] great sight
[1:11:02] why the bush is not burning and when the
[1:11:03] lord saw that he turned aside to see
[1:11:06] god wait a minute i thought it was the
[1:11:08] angel of the lord in the bush
[1:11:10] that's right this is the lord
[1:11:13] god you can't separate them the pillar
[1:11:15] of fire
[1:11:17] same one it's the same one that led
[1:11:19] israel
[1:11:20] pillar of fire age of the lord
[1:11:23] the wheel and the wheel the ancient of
[1:11:25] days

[1:11:30] valley
[1:11:31] the bright morning star the son of david
[1:11:35] the king of kings the lord of lords

[1:19:44] dog

[1:19:46] dogs she said

[1:21:36] this is in the message restoration of
[1:21:39] the bride tree
[1:21:41] brother branham said all that the winner
[1:21:43] killed that's
[1:21:45] hard to believe that the winner actually
[1:21:47] killed
[1:21:48] plants last winter it's been
[1:21:52] you know 70s 80s nice weather nice
[1:21:54] temperature
[1:21:55] last couple months but in the middle of
[1:21:58] december in the middle of january in the
[1:22:00] middle of february
[1:22:02] those same pretty flowers that you've
[1:22:04] cut and put in bases
[1:22:06] and they're dead
[1:22:09] they were under six inches of snow and
[1:22:11] ice
[1:22:15] but if there's a law of life
[1:22:18] in them when the heat from the sun hits
[1:22:21] them again
[1:22:22] it will bring forth life again
[1:22:26] the same law when he set the moon he set
[1:22:30] the sun
[1:22:31] that same law keeps them where they
[1:22:33] should be
[1:22:35] and it's the same law in you and me that
[1:22:38] keeps us
[1:22:40] right
[1:22:47] all that the winner killed the sun
[1:22:49] restores
[1:22:50] returning of the sun what does it do it
[1:22:53] forces
[1:22:54] it forces death listen when the sun
[1:22:57] the spring sun comes back in line to the
[1:23:00] earth
[1:23:00] it actually forces death to give up its
[1:23:04] dead
[1:23:06] earlier in this tape brother banham was
[1:23:09] telling
[1:23:11] about how a man came to the tabernacle
[1:23:13] in jeffersonville from
[1:23:15] georgia drove all the way up there
[1:23:18] had his car stolen while he was up there
[1:23:21] they came to brother branham said
[1:23:23] somebody stole the man's car
[1:23:25] let's pray brother branham while he was
[1:23:28] praying
[1:23:29] the lord showed him a vision he showed
[1:23:32] him a man wearing a yellow shirt
[1:23:34] driving to on the way to bowling green
[1:23:36] kentucky
[1:23:37] and god said turn around go back
[1:23:41] drop that car off on a certain street in
[1:23:43] louisville kentucky
[1:23:46] brother branham said he's not there yet
[1:23:49] but he's turning around
[1:23:51] and he's got your car you'll find your
[1:23:53] car on a certain street there in
[1:23:54] louisville
[1:23:56] what was it it was the agent of god
[1:23:58] brother branham was not the agent
[1:24:00] amen yeah right right it's the agent of
[1:24:03] god the holy ghost
[1:24:04] amen you have a secret agent
[1:24:08] the holy ghost and it was the agent
[1:24:11] enforcing the law
[1:24:20] and it winter time it looks pretty bleak
[1:24:22] sometimes it just looks like there's no
[1:24:25] way why do we still have so many
[1:24:28] mosquitoes
[1:24:31] i always heard that the winter supposed
[1:24:32] to kill them but there's just
[1:24:34] pretty plentiful this year
[1:24:39] it forces death to give up its dead
[1:24:43] a resurrection for what a restoration
[1:24:49] everything and nature works according to
[1:24:51] god's law
[1:24:53] death can't hold it anymore

[1:40:20] i'm thankful i had a praying mom and dad
[1:40:29] this is karen i had a big
[1:40:33] big pouch of marijuana in my pocket
[1:40:37] cigarettes
[1:40:41] i was a sinner i was a renegade
[1:40:46] but i was a son of god

[1:40:53] but i was one
[1:40:59] i just took my time on guard duty my
[1:41:02] watch was from three

[1:41:23] you know don't take don't take the
[1:41:25] message out of context don't take the
[1:41:26] bible out of context
[1:41:29] my goodness well brother adam said
[1:41:33] are you sure he said that right are you
[1:41:35] sure he's
[1:41:36] well that guy that shirt said exactly
[1:41:40] who are you going to listen say what the
[1:41:41] tape says
[1:41:50] three o'clock i just got on guard there
[1:41:53] was three of us
[1:41:54] one here one back where that guy is one
[1:41:57] over here on this by this corner of the
[1:41:58] building
[1:42:01] our perimeter wasn't 35 yards wide
[1:42:05] it was real small but the
[1:42:11] trick was we had a fourth guy kind of
[1:42:14] like the hebrews had a fourth man in the
[1:42:16] furnace in the furnace
[1:42:19] we had a fourth man that was the roving
[1:42:22] guard
[1:42:24] and he would go to spud we called him
[1:42:26] spud because he was from
[1:42:28] idaho a potato
[1:42:31] spud swanstrom he'd go to
[1:42:34] spud it's dark it's so dark you can't
[1:42:37] see your hand from your face
[1:42:40] spud don't shoot i'm coming over
[1:42:43] this is this is galvin galvin was on
[1:42:47] the roving guard that night spud
[1:42:51] he's over there bunker number one
[1:42:56] he goes over to bunker number two tom
[1:42:58] motion was
[1:42:59] bunker number two tom don't shoot this
[1:43:02] is galvin
[1:43:03] the bunker was no higher than this
[1:43:07] platform i mean it wasn't like 40 feet
[1:43:09] up in the air
[1:43:13] don't shoot this is this galvan coming
[1:43:15] over
[1:43:16] okay because you don't know who's
[1:43:19] coming over that perimeter they come in
[1:43:22] with a knife
[1:43:24] nice and quiet no guns
[1:43:27] no flashlights not making a bunch of
[1:43:30] noise not waving flags
[1:43:36] i was on the third bunker doc
[1:43:39] i was the medic so they call me doc doc
[1:43:42] this is galvin don't shoot
[1:43:49] galvin was over by me about that time
[1:43:53] tom motion
[1:43:54] bunker number two he said i think
[1:43:57] something's in the wire
[1:43:58] we had barbed wire we had trip flyers in
[1:44:01] our wire
[1:44:03] the slightest little breeze would set a
[1:44:05] flare off you just take your m16
[1:44:07] and clear the ground you didn't have to
[1:44:10] ask questions you just
[1:44:12] opened fire because a lot of times it
[1:44:15] wasn't the wind
[1:44:16] it might have been a monkey it might
[1:44:18] have been a rat
[1:44:20] but it might have been the enemy yeah
[1:44:27] galvin was over by me sergeant motion
[1:44:30] tom motion said i think something's in
[1:44:32] the wire
[1:44:35] well we also had little handheld flares
[1:44:38] they look like little
[1:44:38] fireworks displays that you can buy at
[1:44:41] the big tent down the corner
[1:44:43] a little firework it light up for 10
[1:44:46] seconds
[1:44:47] the little phosphorous green or
[1:44:51] it's just enough to get a glimpse of
[1:44:54] what's
[1:44:55] in the area but it's only for a couple
[1:44:58] seconds
[1:45:01] and so galvin said go ahead put a flare
[1:45:04] up
[1:45:06] see if there's something in the wire
[1:45:09] because when they come in they're not
[1:45:12] running through they are deliberate
[1:45:16] i think the bible says in the book of
[1:45:18] jude that certain men
[1:45:20] have crept in unaware
[1:45:25] read it for what it's worth there's a
[1:45:28] lot of things creep into our life
[1:45:37] tom motion shot that flare in this guy
[1:45:41] if i could yell as loud as he yelled
[1:45:45] and i would prepare you that i'm going
[1:45:46] to yell it would still scare you
[1:45:50] i have never in my life heard a human
[1:45:53] being
[1:45:53] yell as loud as tom motion yelled that
[1:45:56] night
[1:45:58] there's gooks in the wire
[1:46:01] i looked up there's a standing
[1:46:05] there with a rocket on his shoulder went
[1:46:06] down on his knee
[1:46:10] coming right at me
[1:46:14] oh my goodness my marijuana my
[1:46:16] cigarettes
[1:46:17] i'm if i die now i don't want to die
[1:46:22] with that i don't want to die
[1:46:28] i quit smoking 23 times
[1:46:36] why i was a paratrooper i jumped out of
[1:46:39] airplanes
[1:46:40] 23 times and i thought if i die
[1:46:43] i don't want a carton of cigarettes i
[1:46:44] don't want a pack of cigarettes in my
[1:46:46] shirt pocket
[1:46:49] so i quit every time before i jumped
[1:46:52] and i get on the ground say hey man you
[1:46:53] got a cigarette like borrow give me give
[1:46:55] a smoke
[1:46:59] but the 24th time it was for real
[1:47:03] it wasn't just for me it's because
[1:47:07] i wanted to be a christian
[1:47:13] and if i could duplicate how jesus cried
[1:47:17] because he knew the urgency of the hour
[1:47:20] he didn't just whisper he cried
[1:47:24] saying if any man thirst
[1:47:28] let him come unto me and drink he that
[1:47:31] believeth on me
[1:47:32] as the scripture has said
[1:47:36] out of his belly shall flow rivers of
[1:47:40] living water are you okay sister cheryl
[1:47:42] i didn't mean to
[1:47:44] take so long
[1:47:48] he still i believe
[1:47:52] we're in the last day
[1:47:55] there's no more messengers no more
