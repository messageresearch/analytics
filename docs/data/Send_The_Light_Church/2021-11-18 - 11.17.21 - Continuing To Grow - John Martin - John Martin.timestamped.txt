[39:11] but he that lacketh these things is
[39:13] blind
[39:14] and cannot see it far off
[39:17] and it's forgotten
[39:18] that he was purged from his own sins
[39:20] excuse me
[39:25] you know it just happens you know as you

[39:43] shall be ministered unto you abundantly
[39:45] into the everlasting kingdom of our lord
[39:47] and savior jesus christ
[39:49] wherefore i will not be
[39:52] negligent
[39:53] to put you always in remembrance
[39:56] of these things
[39:58] though
[39:59] ye know them
[40:00] and be established in the present truth
[40:04] yeah i think it means as long as i am in
[40:06] this tabernacle to stir you up by
[40:08] putting you in remembrance knowing that
[40:10] shortly i must put off my tabernacle
[40:12] this my tabernacle even as the lord
[40:14] jesus christ
[40:16] have shown me god bless you may be
[40:18] seated
[40:22] i just want to read the the last verse
[40:24] verse 15 moreover
[40:26] i will
[40:27] endeavor
[40:28] that ye may be able moreover i will
[40:31] endeavor that you may be able after my
[40:34] depar after my decease to have these
[40:39] things always
[40:41] in
[40:42] remembrance
[40:44] wow
[40:46] peter was wanting us
[40:49] to remember
[40:52] peter was an ignorant and unlearned
[40:55] disciple
[40:59] but he believed in continuing to grow
[41:01] his relationship with god
[41:05] he was compelled by the holy ghost
[41:07] inside of him to remind other believers
[41:11] always to keep building your character
[41:16] and under no circumstances are we
[41:18] allowed to float by
[41:21] in our christian walk without the
[41:23] mindset of building our personal
[41:26] character
[41:29] this is a very strong statement because
[41:32] we're often tempted
[41:34] as long as this as long as that
[41:38] i'm good
[41:40] but the mindset needs to be
[41:45] we need to keep adding to what we
[41:47] already are
[41:50] now it doesn't matter how long we've
[41:51] been a christian
[41:53] how long we've been in the message or
[41:55] how far along
[41:57] we think we are
[41:59] peter said in verse 12 wherefore i will
[42:02] not be negligent to put you always in
[42:06] remembrance of these things
[42:08] though you
[42:09] know them and be established in the
[42:12] present truth
[42:15] now why would there be such a need to
[42:17] tell someone who already knows
[42:20] who's already heard
[42:22] who's already established in the message
[42:24] of the hour
[42:27] about continuing to build god's divine
[42:30] nature why
[42:33] because it's the human tendency to close
[42:36] by in our christian walk without
[42:38] thinking about adding more of god's
[42:40] nature to us
[42:42] because we think i'm saved i'm in the
[42:44] message i'm bright
[42:45] as if there's a settlement there
[42:48] and we're forgetting what this christian
[42:50] walk is really about
[42:52] it's about becoming in his image
[42:55] amen
[42:57] and so a stirring is needed
[43:00] a constant reminding of one another
[43:05] look at this was such a concern on on
[43:07] peter's on peter's heart
[43:10] i'm not going to be i'm i may forget a
[43:12] lot of things i may not do a lot of
[43:14] things but i am not going to be
[43:16] negligent about stirring you up about
[43:18] reminding you about how important it is
[43:20] that you go through the course of the
[43:21] day and you're thinking about adding the
[43:23] nature of god to your life
[43:27] and i'm so concerned about this that
[43:29] even when i'm not here and i shouldn't
[43:30] be worried about anything i'm concerned
[43:32] that it stays in your mind
[43:35] so it's an important issue to peter
[43:39] this burden for the saints to keep
[43:41] adding god's divine nature on a regular
[43:43] basis it was it was so strong
[43:46] on peter
[43:50] being established in the present truth
[43:52] has no bearing
[43:55] on
[43:59] being established in the present truth
[44:01] has no bearing on the reminding
[44:04] so i want to make that statement so it
[44:06] doesn't matter how established you are
[44:09] how much you're in the message how much
[44:10] of the message you know
[44:12] you still need to be reminded
[44:15] and you know it's not by the preacher
[44:18] if i could say this i believe it was the
[44:20] holy ghost in peter that was directing
[44:22] it to rem to remind the saints
[44:25] how many times have we sat in church we
[44:27] heard something oh yeah i've already
[44:28] heard it i know it i've heard that so
[44:31] many times yeah yeah love yeah
[44:34] yeah and it just kind of like water off
[44:37] of a duck's back
[44:39] because it's a it's a head knowledge and
[44:41] it's not a nature
[44:45] so the manifestation of really being
[44:48] established
[44:50] is the evidence of truly believing
[44:58] the manifestation of really being
[45:00] established
[45:02] is the evidence that we truly believe
[45:06] second chronicles 20 20.
[45:09] i just want to spend a couple minutes
[45:12] on believing and getting established and
[45:14] prospering because this is all part of
[45:16] growing in christ
[45:19] ii chronicles 20 20 says believe in the
[45:21] lord your god so shall you be
[45:23] established believe in his prophets so
[45:25] shall you prosper
[45:28] now there's a lot of private
[45:30] interpretations of what it means to
[45:32] really believe
[45:35] but this word believe means that you
[45:37] trust
[45:39] and that you are certain
[45:41] that you are firm that you are faithful
[45:45] that you are steadfast and that you are
[45:47] permanent
[45:51] because a lot of people say they believe
[45:53] that they are not established
[45:57] they're not steadfast they're not
[46:00] permanent they're not faithful they're
[46:02] not firm they're not certain but they
[46:04] they're still in the message
[46:07] still go to church
[46:09] still say they believe
[46:12] but the real proof of believing is when
[46:14] you become established because the
[46:16] scripture says but if you believe on the
[46:18] lord your god so shall ye be established
[46:21] it ain't for some christians
[46:23] it's for everyone that believes amen
[46:30] in other words when you hear the truth
[46:32] and you confirm that you believe it or
[46:34] you say amen
[46:36] what should happen is our lives
[46:39] should change
[46:42] it's that simple
[46:44] to truly believe means that the word
[46:45] becomes steadfast in our life now
[46:48] it becomes a a permanent fixture
[46:51] we become faithful to live it
[46:58] this belief is not like the devils
[47:00] believe
[47:01] because the devils believe in the lord
[47:03] our god
[47:05] right
[47:06] come on
[47:09] when the devils believe
[47:10] they never become established in christ
[47:15] their belief never helps them with their
[47:17] relationship with christ
[47:20] their belief is only a knowledge of the
[47:23] truth
[47:26] they don't ever become faithful to the
[47:27] word they hear
[47:30] that's why
[47:31] christians can sit in church hear the
[47:33] word of god
[47:34] or believers hear the word of god
[47:37] and they never change
[47:41] because they're believing like the devil
[47:42] believes
[47:45] we need to become steadfast and
[47:49] a fixture permanent to the word that
[47:51] we're hearing today and that's why
[47:53] everything that this depends on your
[47:56] heart to god to say god i'm really here
[47:59] because i want what's being spoken amen
[48:03] that's right now that i'm here because
[48:04] it's church night and i got to get to
[48:06] church
[48:08] when we truly believe it's not something
[48:11] that we just agree with
[48:14] that it's the truth
[48:15] but it's something that actually becomes
[48:17] added to our life
[48:23] i wish
[48:25] now brother branham said the holy ghost
[48:27] says amen to every word of god
[48:30] but but that doesn't mean the devil
[48:32] don't say amen
[48:35] and i love brother bruce
[48:37] so much because he's such an amen
[48:40] amen a word amen
[48:44] and brother ben said
[48:45] the holy ghost will say amen to every
[48:47] word of god so it has to happen
[48:49] but that doesn't mean
[48:51] the devil don't say amen
[48:55] remember those uh those people that
[48:57] followed uh paul and said these be of
[49:00] the most high god they were saying amen
[49:02] to the word
[49:05] but it wasn't the right spirit
[49:08] did not the devil tell eve amen yeah god
[49:11] said that
[49:13] but what about this
[49:15] see so the amen is not good enough
[49:18] what is really needed is the
[49:20] manifestation of the word that we hear
[49:23] now there was a time in my life that i
[49:25] had long here
[49:29] and i i do you remember me having long
[49:31] hair brother bruce i don't know if
[49:33] it would have been close to that time
[49:34] but i
[49:36] my wife remembers me having long hair
[49:38] because
[49:41] but she just remembers me at that time
[49:43] that i had long hair
[49:45] and when i went to church and i heard
[49:47] the gospel preached about it
[49:50] and i said amen so be it
[49:52] but if i never manifested it
[49:55] what i truly say what i truly believe it
[50:00] so i can sit in church and i can say
[50:02] amen yeah
[50:04] a man should not have long hair because
[50:05] that's what the what the bible says
[50:09] but if i left my hair long
[50:12] would i really believe it
[50:15] no therefore i cannot become established
[50:19] in that scripture
[50:21] and that's why we need to keep adding
[50:23] it's not because we're not believers and
[50:24] we don't believe in jesus here it's
[50:26] there's so many things in our life
[50:28] there's so many things in god's divine
[50:30] nature he wants to see inside of us
[50:34] and and we've got to receive the word
[50:40] notice when the devil believes
[50:43] he has no interest in adding god's
[50:45] divine nature to himself
[50:49] and that's because it takes a crucified
[50:52] life to actually add god's divine nature
[50:55] because everything that god wants you to
[50:57] do in here i'm telling you it ain't for
[50:59] your flesh it ain't going to make you
[51:01] feel good
[51:05] if it does you've got a misunderstanding
[51:08] of what he's really wanting you to do
[51:15] the devils have no interest in
[51:17] crucifying their will
[51:20] in fact they're out there to stop you
[51:22] from doing god's will
[51:26] but yet
[51:27] they believe
[51:30] and this is what's scary about it says
[51:31] you want us to relax and understand what
[51:34] it really takes to believe the word of
[51:35] god
[51:37] with this in mind
[51:39] we can better see why peter was always
[51:42] reminding the saints that we need to
[51:44] keep adding the divine nature
[51:48] not the knowledge
[51:50] not the head knowledge right
[51:53] but the actual life
[51:55] the actual life to us as individuals
[51:59] now we believe in a god that can take
[52:01] our our nature no matter how corrupt it
[52:04] is how bad it is and literally change it
[52:07] he's the only one that can do it man has
[52:09] never been able to do that by himself
[52:13] might be certain things in a person's
[52:15] life that he can correct or overcome but
[52:18] when it comes to that desire to do your
[52:20] own will only god can change that
[52:28] peter knew that the devil would always
[52:30] be trying to give the believers the same
[52:32] knowledge of god
[52:34] but without a revelation
[52:38] he loves for us just to soak in the
[52:40] knowledge
[52:43] in fact if the devil can get you the
[52:44] knowledge before god can give you the
[52:46] revelation don't you think he's going to
[52:48] go for it
[52:53] we know so you know we've heard this
[52:54] that there's you know certain people
[52:56] churches certain they know the bible so
[52:58] well but you don't see the life
[53:04] the devil don't care
[53:06] how many
[53:07] seminaries there are
[53:10] you don't care how many bible
[53:11] universities there are you don't care
[53:14] about how many bible studies there are
[53:18] knowledge doesn't bother him amen
[53:22] brother brahm taught us that eve lusted
[53:24] for knowledge and you know what satan
[53:26] gave it to her
[53:28] the thing that she wanted satan gave it
[53:30] to her so we can sit here and want the
[53:32] knowledge of god without wanting to
[53:34] please god with that knowledge it's just
[53:36] the enemy you're opening the door to the
[53:38] enemy to come in
[53:44] if you receive knowledge from the wrong
[53:46] source which is the wrong spirit it will
[53:50] not bring forth life inside of you
[53:56] it's not true knowledge of the truth
[53:58] that sets us free
[54:01] it's the spirit of truth that sets man
[54:03] free and what does it set him free from
[54:05] from himself
[54:11] peter was wanting to make sure that the
[54:12] saints
[54:13] weren't just adding head knowledge
[54:16] but that they were adding to god's
[54:19] divine nature
[54:21] or adding god's divine nature to their
[54:23] lives one step at a time one after the
[54:27] other
[54:29] make sure you understand that your
[54:30] calling and your election
[54:32] is about god's divine nature that's what
[54:35] we've been called to that's what our
[54:36] election is
[54:39] we've been called to be in this image
[54:41] it's christ in you the hope of glory
[54:49] and not just a knowledge of god's word
[54:53] believe in the lord your god so shall ye
[54:55] be established so shall you be firm
[54:57] faithful steadfast and permanent believe
[55:00] in his prophets
[55:02] so shall he
[55:04] prosper
[55:07] someone that is not faithful and
[55:09] steadfast
[55:11] is someone who's just believing from the
[55:13] head
[55:16] it's a head knowledge
[55:18] but when you believe from the heart in
[55:19] other words it's a love relationship now
[55:22] god will establish you
[55:27] now all of us are established to appoint
[55:31] all of us are believers to a point all
[55:33] of us have god's nature to a point
[55:35] and eight we say amen to that to every
[55:38] one of us
[55:39] but we're talking about what's
[55:41] lacking
[55:43] and when we come to church the word is
[55:45] preached to us and that word
[55:48] kind of sees where we're at in the
[55:50] balance
[55:51] right
[55:52] and so we're not we're not wanting to to
[55:55] to to get uh to
[55:57] uh to get re-baptized if you've been
[55:59] baptized
[56:01] we're not wanting to to to cut your hair
[56:03] if you already got the revelation
[56:06] but if i if i see it start to grow up
[56:08] grow out again
[56:10] [Laughter]
[56:12] you understand god is dealing with us
[56:14] where we're not right
[56:17] because he's calling us higher
[56:21] and so when we hear the word we
[56:23] shouldn't be offended or being hurt or
[56:25] bothered
[56:27] because god is just trying to add to our
[56:29] lives
[56:33] a double minded person
[56:36] will always be unstable
[56:41] because as a man thinketh so is he
[56:44] it's important
[56:46] that we
[56:47] make up our minds on things
[56:53] quickly
[56:55] now i know there's certain things
[56:58] that god
[57:00] has yet to show us
[57:02] but too often our life becomes
[57:04] wishy-washy
[57:06] we need to make a decision and we need
[57:08] to stick with it
[57:12] tell you if we want to get our lives
[57:14] more established we need to practice
[57:16] these little things
[57:18] it could start
[57:19] when you go to the restaurant and you're
[57:22] trying to decide what you're going to
[57:23] eat
[57:26] what are we going to eat tonight honey
[57:29] well i don't know
[57:32] i kind of want this but what do you hey
[57:34] let's just ask the waitress what do you
[57:35] think i should have yes
[57:37] as if they know your feelings and
[57:39] emotions but how many times have we done
[57:40] that tell me what's the best
[57:45] we have to practice
[57:46] being single-minded
[57:49] and and take a stand this is it this is
[57:51] where i'm at and walk forward now not
[57:54] with such a bullheaded that god can't
[57:56] speak to us if we're wrong
[57:59] but when we you know
[58:01] pretty soon the devil is just gonna
[58:03] you're never gonna become established
[58:05] and if you don't become established how
[58:07] are you going to blossom
[58:10] so i want to push a little bit
[58:12] further in this believe in the lord your
[58:13] god so shall you be established believe
[58:15] in his prophets so shall ye prosper
[58:19] now when we believe in those who god has
[58:21] sent to us the same way that we believe
[58:24] god's word
[58:26] god will reward the believer with
[58:28] prosperity
[58:31] now that's your scripture
[58:34] god will honor those
[58:37] that he sends
[58:41] god honors those that he sends to you
[58:45] if we don't believe that then we don't
[58:47] believe that god is in us helping
[58:48] anybody
[58:52] jesus said as you've done to the least
[58:54] of these my little ones you've done unto
[58:57] me
[58:59] he also said whosoever shall give
[59:02] give to drink unto one of these little
[59:04] ones a cup of cold water only in the
[59:08] name of a disciple verily i say unto you
[59:11] he shall in no wise lose his reward
[59:16] in the name of a disciple
[59:18] wasn't even in the name of jesus
[59:21] but jesus is standing behind that
[59:24] disciple
[59:27] and when god tells you to do something
[59:29] no matter how great or how small it
[59:31] might be do it
[59:33] when brother bram tells the story that
[59:35] he he could go get up in the morning and
[59:39] and go preach to to thousands and god
[59:41] told me i just want you to go over to
[59:43] your neighbors and start chopping wood
[59:46] for her and give her some wood
[59:49] it was the will of god and god was
[59:52] behind it
[59:55] now but what about when god sends us a
[59:59] matthew chapter 10 verse 41 if you want
[1:00:02] to write it down matthew chapter 10
[1:00:04] verse 41 he that receiveth a prophet
[1:00:07] in the name of a prophet
[1:00:10] shall receive a prophet's reward
[1:00:14] you get the same reward as the prophet
[1:00:17] gets just to receive them amen
[1:00:20] that is amazing
[1:00:24] doesn't seem fair the prophet does all
[1:00:26] the work
[1:00:27] gets all the criticism
[1:00:30] and yet by just believing the message
[1:00:33] that god gave him to us
[1:00:35] we get the same reward that the prophet
[1:00:37] gets
[1:00:42] i don't know if i'll have time to get
[1:00:44] back to this
[1:00:45] but i want you to think
[1:00:48] when brother branham went beyond the
[1:00:49] curtain of time
[1:00:52] and he was
[1:00:54] you could tell that he was not all there
[1:00:57] because he said is these all branhams
[1:01:01] so he wasn't fully
[1:01:04] seen what actually was happening to him
[1:01:08] and these
[1:01:10] were his converts
[1:01:14] you talk about that that song look
[1:01:17] around look at your reward
[1:01:19] the reward were the souls that came in
[1:01:22] through his ministry and they received
[1:01:25] the same reward he did eternal life
[1:01:33] god don't send a prophet with well you
[1:01:35] could take it or leave it
[1:01:42] and he that receiveth a righteous man in
[1:01:44] the name of a righteous man
[1:01:46] shall receive a righteous man's reward
[1:01:50] now what kind of reward would you like
[1:01:53] verse 40
[1:01:55] he that receiveth you
[1:01:57] receiveth me
[1:01:58] and he that receiveth me receiveth him
[1:02:01] that sent me
[1:02:03] so here
[1:02:04] jesus is
[1:02:05] sending us his disciples out two by two
[1:02:08] or go ye out into all the world jesus
[1:02:10] was sending them and if they receive you
[1:02:13] they're actually receiving god his
[1:02:14] father
[1:02:16] are you with me
[1:02:19] we're talking about what it means to
[1:02:21] believe the prophets is to actually
[1:02:22] receive
[1:02:24] the word that they spoke
[1:02:26] now god uses his body to get the message
[1:02:29] over to other
[1:02:31] members of the
[1:02:32] body right that's how you and i came in
[1:02:38] matthew or malachi chapter 4 verse 5 if
[1:02:41] you want to write it down
[1:02:43] malachi chapter 4 verse 5 this is a
[1:02:46] a prophecy of a
[1:02:49] it's actually a twofold prophecy
[1:02:53] these next two verses
[1:02:56] but this one here is strictly to our age
[1:02:59] he says behold i will send you elijah
[1:03:02] the prophet
[1:03:03] before the great and dreadful day of the
[1:03:07] lord
[1:03:10] now we all the whole world is feeling
[1:03:13] it's got to be close
[1:03:16] got to be close so we know that it's
[1:03:18] prophesied to have a prophet on the
[1:03:21] scene before
[1:03:23] the coming of that great and dreadful
[1:03:26] day of the lord
[1:03:29] and the next verse verse 6
[1:03:32] and he shall turn the heart of the
[1:03:34] fathers to the children the heart of the
[1:03:35] children of the fathers lest they come
[1:03:37] and smite the earth with a curse now
[1:03:39] this may seem kind of backwards why
[1:03:40] would you want to
[1:03:42] go right back to where you started but
[1:03:44] this is a twofold prophecy this verse
[1:03:46] referring to the prophet that came
[1:03:48] before his first coming as well as the
[1:03:51] prophet before his second coming
[1:03:54] so the first coming was the fathers to
[1:03:57] the children and
[1:03:59] in our age it's the heart of the
[1:04:01] children back to the pentecostal
[1:04:05] apostolic fathers of our faith amen on
[1:04:08] the day of pentecost that's that's what
[1:04:10] he has to bring us to that or else or
[1:04:14] else lest i come and smite the earth
[1:04:17] with a curse
[1:04:19] so it's mighty important that our faith
[1:04:21] is turned back to the apostolic fathers
[1:04:24] you can you say amen to that
[1:04:27] now remember when jesus was transfigured
[1:04:29] before his disciples
[1:04:32] and peter john was having a supernatural
[1:04:35] experience
[1:04:38] but their minds weren't in the spirit
[1:04:41] because they wanted to build three
[1:04:43] tabernacles
[1:04:46] they were having a supernatural
[1:04:47] experience
[1:04:49] but their mind wasn't in the spirit
[1:04:50] think about that
[1:04:54] didn't have the mind of god
[1:04:56] they just were so caught up
[1:04:59] spilled three tabernacles
[1:05:03] but the lord didn't want three
[1:05:04] tabernacles
[1:05:05] let's pick it up in matthew 17 verse 5.
[1:05:08] we're gonna read about seven eight
[1:05:10] verses there matthew chapter 17 verse
[1:05:12] five
[1:05:14] now while peter was speaking
[1:05:17] you know god just cut him off god just
[1:05:20] cut him off
[1:05:21] right in the middle of his speaking a
[1:05:23] bright cloud overshadowed them
[1:05:26] and behold a voice out of the cloud
[1:05:28] which said this is my beloved son
[1:05:32] in whom i am well pleased lovely here
[1:05:35] here's the message hear ye
[1:05:38] him
[1:05:42] this is who you got to listen to
[1:05:44] don't listen to what's in your head
[1:05:47] i don't care how much you think you've
[1:05:49] had the supernatural experience and this
[1:05:51] is you think you should do this because
[1:05:53] you had this and only it was you and two
[1:05:55] other brothers
[1:05:56] i don't care hear ye him
[1:06:01] stick with the word
[1:06:03] and when the disciples heard it they
[1:06:05] fell on their face and they were sore
[1:06:07] afraid
[1:06:09] they were afraid they didn't have it
[1:06:11] right
[1:06:14] this
[1:06:16] voice from heaven that spoke out of the
[1:06:19] cloud it was preeminent
[1:06:23] it was real
[1:06:25] and jesus came and he touched them and
[1:06:27] said arise and be not afraid
[1:06:30] and when they lifted up their eyes
[1:06:33] they didn't see moses and elijah anymore
[1:06:36] they saw no man save jesus only
[1:06:41] if god has his way
[1:06:43] in our speaking
[1:06:45] when whoever we're speaking to when we
[1:06:47] get done people are going to see jesus
[1:06:50] only
[1:06:51] they're not going to see a man's
[1:06:53] reputation they're not good they're not
[1:06:55] interested in that and god is not
[1:06:57] interested in giving them that
[1:07:00] it's jesus only
[1:07:03] i believe in the jesus only
[1:07:07] and as they came down from the mountain
[1:07:09] jesus charged them saying tell the
[1:07:11] vision to no man until
[1:07:14] i die and be risen again
[1:07:18] so you can share this little testimony
[1:07:20] but wait
[1:07:21] sometimes we have experiences there's a
[1:07:23] time to share them and the time not to
[1:07:27] and his disciples asked him saying
[1:07:30] why then not notice after this great
[1:07:32] experience
[1:07:34] why then
[1:07:35] and his disabled assassin saying why
[1:07:37] then
[1:07:38] say the scribes
[1:07:40] that elias must first come
[1:07:45] and they're talking about this this
[1:07:47] scripture here in malachi
[1:07:50] and jesus answered and said unto them
[1:07:53] elias truly shall first come and what's
[1:07:57] his job going to be restore all things
[1:08:01] going to restore that faith back that
[1:08:02] jesus christ is the same yesterday today
[1:08:05] and forever he hasn't changed he's still
[1:08:07] as much god today as he ever was through
[1:08:09] history
[1:08:16] now when he makes this statement
[1:08:18] john the baptist was already dead
[1:08:21] i think it was chapter 4 that he died
[1:08:23] this is chapter 17.
[1:08:27] but since malachi
[1:08:28] was a two-fold prophecy hid in the
[1:08:30] scriptures
[1:08:33] jesus said but i say unto you in verse
[1:08:35] 12 that elias has come already and they
[1:08:38] have done
[1:08:40] and they knew it not they knew him not
[1:08:42] and have done unto him whatsoever they
[1:08:44] listed likewise shall they also the son
[1:08:46] of man suffer of them
[1:08:49] then the disciples understood that he
[1:08:50] spake unto them of john the baptist
[1:08:53] but understand
[1:08:55] john the baptist did not come before
[1:08:57] that great and dreadful day of the lord
[1:09:00] another thing is john the baptist did
[1:09:02] not restore
[1:09:04] the bible says he didn't do miracles
[1:09:08] so this is definitely talking of a
[1:09:09] prophet in this age
[1:09:13] jesus said that the job of the end time
[1:09:15] prophet was to restore all things
[1:09:19] in this late hour that we're living in
[1:09:22] such confusion in this religious world
[1:09:25] they need to be restored to the original
[1:09:28] word the original faith
[1:09:35] revelations
[1:09:36] 10 7
[1:09:38] speaking of the same
[1:09:40] messenger same
[1:09:42] prophet but in the days of the voice of
[1:09:44] the seventh angel
[1:09:46] when he shall begin to sound
[1:09:49] the mystery of god should be finished
[1:09:52] as he have declared to his servants the
[1:09:55] prophets
[1:09:56] now we've all
[1:09:58] played clue
[1:10:00] or watch shows
[1:10:02] or
[1:10:03] you put
[1:10:04] three things up here and you put
[1:10:07] something on it and you go like this and
[1:10:08] you're trying to
[1:10:10] we've all
[1:10:13] wondered
[1:10:14] at the end of the movie who the real
[1:10:17] killer was
[1:10:19] are you with me
[1:10:21] well we are promised in the bible that
[1:10:24] at
[1:10:25] the at the the voice of the seventh
[1:10:27] angel when he shall begin the sound the
[1:10:29] mystery of god is finished we understand
[1:10:32] baptism we understand
[1:10:35] the godhead
[1:10:36] everything is finished now
[1:10:40] that's why it's so important to listen
[1:10:43] to what that messenger sent
[1:10:47] because that is going to restore our
[1:10:49] faith
[1:10:50] amen amen
[1:10:53] we need it brother branham said
[1:10:54] rapturing faith lies on those tapes
[1:10:57] i know i i love it too when a a minister
[1:11:00] gets up here and he's fiery and telling
[1:11:03] the stories and you just you're just
[1:11:05] soaked right into it you know you just
[1:11:06] feel like you believe so much more when
[1:11:08] you leave and i like that too
[1:11:10] but rapturing faith is in the tapes
[1:11:17] and we need to give respect to the man
[1:11:19] that god sent
[1:11:22] because if we receive the message of the
[1:11:24] prophet we will receive a prophet's
[1:11:27] reward
[1:11:29] believe in the lord your god
[1:11:31] so shall ye be established believe in
[1:11:34] his prophets so shall ye prosper
[1:11:37] now that word prosper means to push
[1:11:40] forward now i want you to think i want
[1:11:42] you to think of your nature your divine
[1:11:45] nature of god now
[1:11:48] prosper means to push forward to break
[1:11:51] out mightily to be profitable
[1:11:55] now i'm not talking about
[1:11:58] money
[1:11:59] monetary
[1:12:08] after we plant a bush or a flower and
[1:12:11] everybody's done this
[1:12:12] the first step after we've accepted it
[1:12:14] into the ground
[1:12:16] is for the plant to become established
[1:12:20] the first thing has got to happen if it
[1:12:22] don't become established what does it do
[1:12:24] it dies it's in the realm but it dies
[1:12:28] so it has to become established
[1:12:32] and then when you see it
[1:12:34] prosper you're seeing it push forward
[1:12:37] new growth it breaks out with with with
[1:12:40] mighty flowers that it it's profitable
[1:12:42] for everybody that comes by and says wow
[1:12:44] that's a beautiful hydrangea
[1:12:50] it has to become established
[1:12:52] and then it begins to grow
[1:12:55] and we see when we see plants that are
[1:12:57] like this and they become like this
[1:12:59] we see what happens out here but did you
[1:13:02] know growth is taking place under the
[1:13:03] ground
[1:13:04] in the roots
[1:13:06] coming to church god's dealing with you
[1:13:08] inside
[1:13:10] you you go through tests and trials and
[1:13:12] the roots go down deeper and before you
[1:13:14] know it you're becoming more established
[1:13:16] it never stops
[1:13:18] you take an oak tree that's 40 years old
[1:13:20] i am telling you the roots are much
[1:13:22] deeper and greater than when it was 20
[1:13:25] years old
[1:13:27] we never stop growing we got to continue
[1:13:30] to grow
[1:13:31] continue to be established in new things
[1:13:34] that god shows us new things god wants
[1:13:37] us to do
[1:13:40] and then we need once we become
[1:13:41] established in every one of them
[1:13:43] we need to start prospering in every one
[1:13:45] of them
[1:13:48] and the prophet taught us how to do that
[1:13:58] it's no different when we receive the
[1:14:01] message
[1:14:04] that god sent through the prophet
[1:14:06] all sudden our spiritual life prospers
[1:14:08] as if it never could have never could
[1:14:12] he's he he's opened up certain things
[1:14:14] that i've never ever seen in the
[1:14:16] scriptures when i read
[1:14:19] because the word prophet he's a seer
[1:14:22] he sees
[1:14:25] and he comes and he gives us what god
[1:14:27] gave him
[1:14:30] the devil has got too many people
[1:14:33] stuck
[1:14:34] on god sent a prophet and have missed
[1:14:36] believing the message
[1:14:42] focus on the belt buckles and the hats
[1:14:43] and the the the mysteries and
[1:14:47] and i'm in the message
[1:14:48] and have missed the actual message
[1:14:53] the brand preached the message running
[1:14:56] without the message
[1:14:58] something like that how'd that go
[1:15:01] amen
[1:15:02] no no
[1:15:05] running without a message
[1:15:09] so sorry i just know that scriptures
[1:15:13] we can run
[1:15:15] run i'm in i'm in the message but not
[1:15:17] have the message
[1:15:20] we got to get into the message it's not
[1:15:22] good enough to say i'm in the message
[1:15:25] i'm stirring up your mind
[1:15:27] hey man it's just stirring it up
[1:15:31] that's why there are so many people
[1:15:33] tossed about
[1:15:35] so many double-minded unstable they're
[1:15:37] ever learning but never able to come to
[1:15:40] the knowledge of the truth
[1:15:42] which is the full discernment
[1:15:44] that's what this message brings you it
[1:15:46] brings us the full discernment of the
[1:15:49] word
[1:15:54] turn with me back to first peter chapter
[1:15:56] one
[1:15:58] are you are you staying with me
[1:16:00] i haven't lost anybody have i

[1:16:14] precious
[1:16:15] faith so he's speaking to us like
[1:16:18] precious faith with us through the
[1:16:21] righteousness of god and our savior
[1:16:22] jesus christ grace and peace
[1:16:26] just multiply it get the calculator out
[1:16:29] be multiplied unto you
[1:16:32] through the knowledge of god
[1:16:34] and of jesus our lord now we're going to
[1:16:37] talk a little bit about knowledge
[1:16:40] in in a little bit but through proper
[1:16:43] knowledge through the knowledge of god
[1:16:44] not the not uh
[1:16:47] the knowledge of god through a wrong
[1:16:51] source
[1:16:53] but grace and peace is multiplied when
[1:16:56] you get the knowledge strictly from the
[1:16:58] holy ghost
[1:17:02] according as his divine power
[1:17:06] have given unto
[1:17:07] unto each one of us
[1:17:09] all things whatever we never need him
[1:17:12] that pertaineth unto his life and his
[1:17:15] godliness
[1:17:17] through the knowledge of him that have
[1:17:19] called us to glory and virtue
[1:17:24] i just love the scriptures
[1:17:27] peter wants us
[1:17:30] to give diligence and to make our
[1:17:33] calling an election a sure thing
[1:17:37] so he's saying
[1:17:38] to give diligence
[1:17:41] and this calling
[1:17:42] is the divine nature
[1:17:46] according as his divine nature has given
[1:17:49] us all things
[1:17:52] i'll tell you
[1:17:55] i don't know
[1:17:57] the hill beans most of the time
[1:18:00] and it's never bothered me
[1:18:03] i ain't got much of a reputation and
[1:18:05] that is it just doesn't bother me
[1:18:08] i make a lot of mistakes i don't mean it
[1:18:10] wrong but it doesn't bother me
[1:18:15] i don't want to wake up and be without
[1:18:17] his divine nature inside of me i won't
[1:18:20] better handle anything
[1:18:22] amen
[1:18:23] that's what i need is his divine nature
[1:18:26] in me i don't need to know anything else
[1:18:27] to save jesus christ and him crucified
[1:18:32] amen
[1:18:34] whereby
[1:18:35] are given unto us exceeding great and
[1:18:40] precious promises
[1:18:43] we've got the word of god now
[1:18:47] that by these promises
[1:18:50] we can partake
[1:18:52] of the divine nature of god
[1:18:54] having escaped the corruption that is in
[1:18:56] the world through lust now how we get
[1:18:59] more of the divine nature of god is when
[1:19:02] we take when we read the bible and the
[1:19:04] bible says i can do all things through
[1:19:08] christ that strengthens me and i say
[1:19:10] amen to that
[1:19:14] and all of a sudden i can do things that
[1:19:15] i never thought i could do
[1:19:18] i could handle things that i thought i
[1:19:19] could never handle before and i don't
[1:19:22] need to google
[1:19:24] i don't need to call the pastor
[1:19:28] i got a hold of god
[1:19:30] his divine nature he don't need help
[1:19:37] we don't attain god's nature through
[1:19:40] human efforts
[1:19:42] when we have tried that all of us have
[1:19:44] we have miserably failed
[1:19:48] we
[1:19:49] attain his divine nature through faith
[1:19:51] in the promises of god
[1:19:53] it's when we decide
[1:19:57] we really believe it
[1:19:59] not with the head knowledge but believe
[1:20:01] it now
[1:20:02] here's i just want to say this
[1:20:05] we
[1:20:07] can't muster up faith
[1:20:11] all we can do is die out cry out let god
[1:20:15] know that i want the faith that you have
[1:20:18] delivered to earnestly contend for the
[1:20:20] faith that was once delivered to the
[1:20:22] saints
[1:20:23] it's a battle
[1:20:25] and and paul said fight the good fight
[1:20:28] of faith lay hold of eternal life it's a
[1:20:30] battle it's not faith is not a gift in
[1:20:33] the aspect that you know you're you're
[1:20:36] born and you can you can really really
[1:20:38] play the guitar
[1:20:41] it's not that kind of
[1:20:43] way or you can sing or you can
[1:20:47] faith is a gift
[1:20:49] but when we're trying
[1:20:52] to grow our spiritual life
[1:20:55] is not handed to us
[1:20:58] and you've got to fight for it
[1:21:01] you can't just defeat the devil with
[1:21:03] knowledge
[1:21:06] he'll whip you every time
[1:21:10] now if god said i can do all things
[1:21:12] through christ or that word
[1:21:15] strength means virtue
[1:21:17] of god then i believe it so we start out
[1:21:21] with faith i'm just going to read that
[1:21:23] real quick
[1:21:24] and besides this verse 5 giving all
[1:21:27] diligence add to your faith virtue and
[1:21:30] to virtue knowledge
[1:21:33] and knowledge
[1:21:40] temperance temperance patience patience
[1:21:42] godliness
[1:21:44] godliness brotherly kindness and the
[1:21:46] brotherly kindness charity now i don't
[1:21:48] have it and sister amanda uh got the
[1:21:51] thing laminated for me and i don't know
[1:21:53] i thought about it eight times
[1:21:55] uh before today's service the last few
[1:21:57] days
[1:21:58] to get this back up we used to have it
[1:22:00] in the other church and it's like a
[1:22:01] little pyramid and at the bottom of this
[1:22:04] pyramid it starts out the foundation is
[1:22:07] faith
[1:22:09] now you cannot build god's divine nature
[1:22:13] on anything but faith
[1:22:16] it has to be the foundation of it you
[1:22:19] can't learn your way into god's nature
[1:22:21] you can't you can't force yourself you
[1:22:23] can't do works it it all starts with
[1:22:26] faith that you believe that you are part
[1:22:29] of god that you believe that that you
[1:22:32] are a seed of god that you are a child
[1:22:34] of god that that all that god is you are
[1:22:39] it starts with faith
[1:22:42] and if god said i can do all things
[1:22:46] through
[1:22:49] strength his strength or his virtue
[1:22:52] then all's we have to do is believe it
[1:22:55] so you add
[1:22:56] to
[1:22:57] your faith virtue virtue is strength
[1:23:01] i'll tell you we all want more strength
[1:23:03] in our life right and inner strength not
[1:23:06] muscles
[1:23:07] but an inner strength that we could just
[1:23:09] you know tell the devil to leave and
[1:23:12] have have we know how to get rid of them
[1:23:15] that that strength
[1:23:18] we all want strength that but that
[1:23:20] strength will not come without first you
[1:23:22] have to believe
[1:23:24] that you can do all things through
[1:23:25] christ now you see what i'm saying it's
[1:23:27] through the promises of god that we get
[1:23:30] the divine nature
[1:23:31] if the word says grow in the grace and
[1:23:34] knowledge of our lord
[1:23:36] then now you have strength to do it
[1:23:38] because you need strength in order to
[1:23:41] grow
[1:23:41] because you're going to have trials and
[1:23:43] you're going to deal with a lot of stuff
[1:23:45] you see how it's building off of the
[1:23:48] other if the word tells me to add
[1:23:51] self-control
[1:23:54] temperance
[1:23:56] tempers that means self-control you look
[1:23:57] it up if the word tells me to add
[1:24:00] self-control to my strength i have
[1:24:04] uh
[1:24:05] i have the the strength to do that now
[1:24:13] just please forgive me
[1:24:14] please forgive me
[1:24:17] add to your faith virtue
[1:24:20] and to your strength knowledge and to
[1:24:23] knowledge
[1:24:24] temperance self
[1:24:26] control and you
[1:24:29] you have self-control now now you can
[1:24:32] learn how to exercise patience
[1:24:36] because a lot of times we want patience
[1:24:38] but we have we want it now
[1:24:41] and temperance gives us the self-control
[1:24:44] to be more patient to let patients have
[1:24:47] its wonderful work amen it's work inside
[1:24:50] of us and then when we've got patience
[1:24:52] then we can we can add godliness to it
[1:24:56] that's a little ways down the road but
[1:24:58] now that godliness what that is is
[1:25:00] respect and reverence to god that's what
[1:25:01] that is if you look that up
[1:25:05] because you need to be patient and let
[1:25:08] god have his way in your life
[1:25:10] you need to respect what he's doing you
[1:25:12] need to respect the test and the trials
[1:25:14] he's put in your life
[1:25:16] you need to respect god god knows what
[1:25:19] he's doing
[1:25:21] you don't see the three hebrew children
[1:25:24] you know lashing out against god
[1:25:28] they committed themselves to god
[1:25:31] you don't see daniel just say quit i'm
[1:25:33] closing the doors i'm gonna pray quietly
[1:25:35] silently it's between me and god anyways
[1:25:37] nobody else needs to know about it
[1:25:40] he knew what he was getting himself into
[1:25:42] but he committed himself to god a lot of
[1:25:44] times we can't commit ourselves to god
[1:25:46] we're still in control
[1:25:48] but but you need that self-control and
[1:25:50] that patience to to respect god enough
[1:25:53] to let him have his way
[1:25:56] that's that godliness and to godliness
[1:25:58] brotherly kindness
[1:26:01] well now i'm going to tell you
[1:26:05] brotherly kindness
[1:26:07] most of us look at brotherly kindness
[1:26:10] is
[1:26:11] is i'm going to do something kind
[1:26:14] for my brother
[1:26:16] and uh
[1:26:18] and
[1:26:19] and then there's times that i'm thinking
[1:26:22] you know what i'm not gonna do
[1:26:24] that anymore
[1:26:26] to that brother
[1:26:29] and we think it's okay because of what
[1:26:30] they did to us
[1:26:32] but can you imagine god being that kind
[1:26:36] of kind to you
[1:26:41] so brotherly kindness
[1:26:44] is to all
[1:26:46] and to be honest if you can't do that
[1:26:49] you can't love god you can't put charity
[1:26:51] on
[1:26:53] john said if you can't love your brother
[1:26:55] who you have see how can you love god
[1:26:57] who you haven't seen so you've got to
[1:26:59] put
[1:27:00] loving your brothers
[1:27:02] to a manifestation before you claim you
[1:27:04] got the love of god
[1:27:06] because the love of god will lay down
[1:27:08] his life for the brother
[1:27:11] i think it's first john chapter 3 verse
[1:27:13] 16 says he lay down his life for us we
[1:27:17] ought to lay down our lives for the
[1:27:18] brethren
[1:27:21] when he's living in you he's going to do
[1:27:23] the same thing
[1:27:26] hereby perceive we the love of god
[1:27:28] because he lay down his life for us and
[1:27:30] we ought to lay down our lives for
[1:27:32] the brethren
[1:27:34] oh i've heard this story
[1:27:37] when
[1:27:38] the
[1:27:40] certain the apostles found out that
[1:27:42] peter they were going to take peter and
[1:27:43] they were going to crucify him and they
[1:27:45] told him to leave
[1:27:48] remember just like they did with paul
[1:27:52] but paul said what do you mean to break
[1:27:54] my heart
[1:27:56] i'm not only willing to go to jerusalem
[1:27:58] i'm willing to die there for him
[1:28:00] but peter when he received word
[1:28:03] he he goes and he escapes to
[1:28:05] jerusalem he he runs out of jerusalem
[1:28:09] and god meets him there jesus meets them
[1:28:11] there
[1:28:13] and when peter sees jesus
[1:28:15] jesus peter asked jesus
[1:28:18] what are you doing here
[1:28:20] what are you doing here
[1:28:23] and jesus said i've come
[1:28:24] to be crucified again
[1:28:28] and at that moment
[1:28:30] peter turned around and walked right
[1:28:32] back into jerusalem to be crucified
[1:28:36] and when he was crucified he was he
[1:28:40] wasn't film worthy to be crucified the
[1:28:42] same way
[1:28:43] so he was hung upside down but the point
[1:28:45] that i'm trying to say christ in you
[1:28:48] will lay down your life for the brethren
[1:28:51] no matter what the crucifixion is
[1:28:54] and i'm i'm thankful that we don't go to
[1:28:56] really die as it were physically
[1:29:00] but we have to die to ourself and our
[1:29:02] will every day to see somebody come to
[1:29:04] christ
[1:29:06] and that's what christ is in you for
[1:29:08] today
[1:29:10] it's to give the word to the rest of the
[1:29:11] body
[1:29:16] we need
[1:29:18] our life capped off with the love of god
[1:29:20] but
[1:29:20] we need to learn to build
[1:29:22] build
[1:29:23] to the divine nature that we have
[1:29:27] i want to just talk a moment about
[1:29:30] knowledge
[1:29:31] because the bible says
[1:29:34] that one of the things that we're
[1:29:35] supposed to add to our nature our divine
[1:29:39] nature
[1:29:40] our character
[1:29:41] is knowledge
[1:29:45] and you add it to your strength i want
[1:29:47] to talk about knowledge for a moment
[1:29:51] i want to say that not all the knowledge
[1:29:53] of god is good
[1:29:56] and i know this is a strong statement
[1:29:59] but not all knowledge of god is good
[1:30:05] any knowledge that is mixed with
[1:30:07] unbelief question or doubt is not good
[1:30:15] the bible tells us
[1:30:17] that knowledge puffeth up
[1:30:19] and i'm sure peter was not wanting us to
[1:30:22] add puff up
[1:30:34] and i'm sure a knowledge that puffs us
[1:30:36] up is not god's nature
[1:30:38] he dwells with the humble
[1:30:41] so even though it's the knowledge of god
[1:30:44] we can get so puffed up with it
[1:30:47] i wonder why
[1:30:48] because we did not receive that
[1:30:51] knowledge
[1:30:52] at that moment
[1:30:54] from the right source
[1:30:56] remember back in the garden there were
[1:30:58] two trees one was the tree of life and
[1:31:00] the other was the tree of knowledge of
[1:31:02] good and evil
[1:31:04] bold trees had as much
[1:31:07] knowledge about god
[1:31:09] i mean lucifer
[1:31:11] dwelt with god he was the right hand man
[1:31:13] of god he had the knowledge of god
[1:31:20] so when we're thinking about adding
[1:31:22] knowledge it's not about sitting and
[1:31:23] just
[1:31:31] because satan has
[1:31:34] a lot of
[1:31:36] ddlds that come out of seminaries that
[1:31:39] know the word backwards and front words
[1:31:40] and satan knows the word backwards in
[1:31:42] front ones how do i know that because
[1:31:44] when you sin he reminds you
[1:31:47] he hits you over the head he tells you
[1:31:49] you're no good you're just a hypocrite
[1:31:52] he knows the word
[1:31:54] and we can know the word
[1:31:57] we can have the knowledge of the word
[1:31:59] and not build anything with our divine
[1:32:01] nature
[1:32:06] here's the thing
[1:32:08] when you believe you become established
[1:32:11] when you receive the knowledge of god it
[1:32:13] ought to produce life
[1:32:17] if not it's just puffing you up and you
[1:32:19] just got to tell everybody about it
[1:32:23] it's too it's the same word coming from
[1:32:26] two different sources
[1:32:30] the tree of knowledge of good
[1:32:33] but
[1:32:35] it doesn't stay good it's a mixed tree
[1:32:37] because there's doubt there's questions
[1:32:39] there's you don't have to do it you
[1:32:41] don't have to be faithful it doesn't
[1:32:42] matter you're still christian
[1:32:47] jesus is your personal savior
[1:32:52] but
[1:32:53] when god speaks to you
[1:32:55] true knowledge
[1:32:57] there's growth
[1:32:59] that takes place
[1:33:01] it adds to your life it's not
[1:33:04] a head knowledge
[1:33:05] it's a heart knowledge
[1:33:08] i want to please you lord i want my life
[1:33:10] to represent you more the next time i go
[1:33:13] through this same trial i want to make a
[1:33:15] different decision for you
[1:33:17] that's what the knowledge of god would
[1:33:19] do for us
[1:33:21] through
[1:33:22] the source
[1:33:23] of the spirit of life
[1:33:26] the spirit of life there's the spirit of
[1:33:28] truth how many loves
[1:33:29] the truth let me say how many loves the
[1:33:31] truth
[1:33:33] harmony loves the truth when it hurts
[1:33:37] come on
[1:33:39] come on
[1:33:41] how many loves the truth when it
[1:33:43] corrects
[1:33:46] see
[1:33:47] you don't say oh lord i love this
[1:33:52] but we don't write
[1:33:53] but we don't have a problem saying i
[1:33:56] love the truth
[1:33:57] set me free
[1:34:01] now when god speaks the truth
[1:34:06] he never that source his intent his
[1:34:08] motive is never to hurt
[1:34:12] never to hurt
[1:34:14] that's why we should never ever
[1:34:17] speak the truth without love because
[1:34:19] when the holy ghost speaks the truth
[1:34:21] it's in love
[1:34:23] it's in love
[1:34:25] because god is love and god is the
[1:34:27] spirit of truth
[1:34:30] and he said as many as i love i rebuke
[1:34:32] and chase him
[1:34:35] that love will correct us
[1:34:37] but understand the devil has the
[1:34:39] capability of using every one of our
[1:34:41] vessels at any given time he wants to if
[1:34:43] we yield it to him and try to speak the
[1:34:46] truth to somebody with the wrong spirit
[1:34:50] and feel religiously right
[1:34:54] and that's
[1:34:55] what's bad about the knowledge of god
[1:34:58] with the wrong spirit
[1:35:00] so understand when we're thinking about
[1:35:03] adding knowledge to our nature
[1:35:06] don't
[1:35:06] study the bible
[1:35:09] naturally
[1:35:10] study the bible lord how can i better
[1:35:12] please you
[1:35:14] it's a relationship when you listen to a
[1:35:17] tape lord i want out of this tape with
[1:35:20] something i
[1:35:22] don't have in my life
[1:35:24] not something i agree with not something
[1:35:26] i want
[1:35:28] but our motive is to get what we don't
[1:35:30] have which is the rest of god's divine
[1:35:32] nature and we need to keep stirring that
[1:35:36] in our lives
[1:35:39] help one another
[1:35:41] remind one another
[1:35:44] we're not
[1:35:46] discouraging one another
[1:35:49] but we're trying to get one another
[1:35:51] to get ready for the wedding
[1:35:56] i'll tell you
[1:35:56] something about this wedding
[1:35:59] you know
[1:36:01] you go to you go to college excuse me
[1:36:02] first thing you know you go to college
[1:36:04] you go to class and the teacher teaches
[1:36:06] the whole class this is what this is
[1:36:08] we're going to start in this chapter
[1:36:09] we're going to go to this chapter and
[1:36:10] then we're going to have an essay at the
[1:36:12] end and then we're going to have an exam
[1:36:13] and we're going to find out who wins or
[1:36:15] who who gets an a
[1:36:19] and you can sit there as long as
[1:36:20] everybody else sits in class and you can
[1:36:22] just go this is so this is so
[1:36:24] dumb
[1:36:27] and see if that helps you
[1:36:31] or you can go home and and and and
[1:36:35] read again and meditate look at your
[1:36:36] notes of the things that were spoken to
[1:36:38] you
[1:36:41] now here's the thing
[1:36:42] the rapture day is already set
[1:36:46] no man knows the day or the hour but
[1:36:48] it's already set
[1:36:50] god is not waiting on any single person
[1:36:55] why because he's no respecter persons
[1:36:59] and when the time has come that the last
[1:37:01] one has come in the last one is saved
[1:37:05] things are going to start happening
[1:37:09] so i say to you that are really
[1:37:12] interested in building god's divine
[1:37:13] nature
[1:37:15] stir up your minds about this don't wait
[1:37:18] for it to be preached to you
[1:37:21] this is a message that peter gave it's
[1:37:23] the same message for us
[1:37:26] we're the ones
[1:37:27] that hold whether that divine nature is
[1:37:30] going to happen
[1:37:32] quickly or slowly
[1:37:34] depends how much we want to die out
[1:37:38] brother jonathan was
[1:37:40] bringing out a good point
[1:37:42] in our men's meeting
[1:37:45] about
[1:37:46] when we really really want to display
[1:37:48] the love of god the key
[1:37:51] is to die out to ourselves
[1:37:54] because in all honesty if
[1:37:57] we're not in the way we're not wanting
[1:37:59] to build another tabernacle
[1:38:02] hey what about me my name is john martin
[1:38:04] what about my tabernacle
[1:38:06] i want to put my tabernacle you know
[1:38:08] with jesus's tabernacle
[1:38:11] that's the problem that we have
[1:38:15] how about
[1:38:16] jesus only in my life
[1:38:19] it's up to us to die out more
[1:38:22] the more we get to know how ugly our
[1:38:23] nature is the more that we realize that
[1:38:25] we are a greatest enemy the more we're
[1:38:27] like i
[1:38:29] i really want to get more serious with
[1:38:31] having god in my life
[1:38:35] stir stir your minds make it your prayer
[1:38:38] amen let's
[1:38:40] finish this reading then we're going to
[1:38:41] have a word of prayer and for if these
[1:38:44] things
[1:38:46] be in you verse 8 and abound
[1:38:49] they make you that you shall neither be
[1:38:50] barren or unfruitful
[1:38:54] in the knowledge of the lord jesus
[1:38:56] christ when i looked up that word
[1:38:58] knowledge
[1:38:59] you'll see there's two
[1:39:01] one talks about science right
[1:39:04] and the other talks about the full
[1:39:06] discernment
[1:39:09] and
[1:39:11] when god shows you something it'll bring
[1:39:13] forth life you'll see the picture real
[1:39:16] clear when the devil tells you something
[1:39:19] it just brings more confusion to your
[1:39:21] mind
[1:39:23] it just does
[1:39:28] but he that lacketh these things
[1:39:31] he that lacks this nature
[1:39:35] these steps
[1:39:36] is blind
[1:39:38] he's just kind of going to church
[1:39:42] he really hasn't had a vision
[1:39:44] he can't see very far
[1:39:46] of what he's supposed to become before
[1:39:49] jesus returns
[1:39:50] and has forgotten
[1:39:52] how bad he really was
[1:39:54] that he
[1:39:56] that he was purged from his own sins
[1:39:59] so he says but wherefore the rather
[1:40:02] instead of being like that
[1:40:04] rather
[1:40:06] give diligence to make your calling and
[1:40:09] your election to this divine nature a
[1:40:13] sure thing amen
[1:40:15] don't try to worry about your other
[1:40:18] things that you feel to do when this is
[1:40:21] really the priority
[1:40:25] well there was no amen so what i'm going
[1:40:26] to do is say
[1:40:28] amen brother john
[1:40:33] for if you do these things ye shall
[1:40:36] never fall
[1:40:39] for so an entrance shall be ministered
[1:40:41] unto you abundantly into the everlasting
[1:40:44] kingdom of our lord and
[1:40:45] our savior jesus christ now i want to
[1:40:48] say i do believe with all my heart
[1:40:51] that god has ministered abundantly
[1:40:59] how to have god's divine nature amen
[1:41:01] we may not preach a prosperity message
[1:41:03] here
[1:41:05] we may not be preaching how you can get
[1:41:07] this that and the other
[1:41:09] but i believe that we have been
[1:41:11] ministered what it takes to have the
[1:41:13] divine nature of jesus christ abundantly
[1:41:16] wherefore i will not be negligent to put
[1:41:20] you always in remembrance of these
[1:41:22] things though ye
[1:41:23] know them and be established in the
[1:41:25] present truth yeah i must i think it
[1:41:28] meet as long as i'm in this tabitha you
[1:41:30] know what i'm just going to keep doing
[1:41:31] the same thing
[1:41:35] i'm going to stir you up
[1:41:37] how am i going to do it i'm going to put
[1:41:39] you in remembrance and you're going to
[1:41:40] say i already know
[1:41:43] and i'm going to say but
[1:41:45] are you already living
[1:41:48] it's not what we know
[1:41:50] it's what we're manifesting
[1:41:54] knowing that i short that shortly i must
[1:41:56] put off this my tabernacle even as the
[1:41:59] lord jesus christ have shown me noticed
[1:42:02] notice god
[1:42:04] showed
[1:42:05] peter
[1:42:06] god showed paul
[1:42:10] and i'll tell you god needs to show
[1:42:11] every one of us we need to put off this
[1:42:13] tabernacle
[1:42:14] we need to put on the lord jesus christ
[1:42:17] moreover i will endeavor that ye may be
[1:42:20] able after my decease
[1:42:22] to have these things always in
[1:42:24] remembrance i just want to say after we
[1:42:26] leave here i want these things to always
[1:42:29] be in your remembrance amen god bless
[1:42:31] you let's stand together
[1:42:37] praise the lord
[1:42:40] how many wants this divine nature
[1:42:42] amen
[1:42:44] it's something that we can be working on
[1:42:46] daily
[1:42:48] one in seeking the lord one in prayer
[1:42:51] one calling on god one reading one
[1:42:53] praying one listening to tapes but you
[1:42:55] know what then you're put into action
[1:42:58] to see if that divine nature is going to
[1:43:00] come out because you will have to yield
[1:43:03] to god in order for it to happen
[1:43:06] because it don't happen on its own this
[1:43:08] flesh is kind of in the way it don't
[1:43:09] want to lay down its life
[1:43:11] don't want to die out

[1:43:40] with our life
[1:43:42] how we live
[1:43:44] decisions we make and how we act and how
[1:43:46] we handle things
