name I will be in the midst of the people are you thankful for that this morning morning that we're not just Gathering here under a Creed or under an idea but we're gathering around the Lord Jesus Christ and he promised to meet the need this morning amen if you have your Bibles let's open our scriptures to Daniel 11:32 it's an honor to be back again uh today um I appreciate the the opportunity by our pastor to be ministering I pray something can be said today to be a to be a blessing and and a help in in some way uh my my family ain't with me today and I I apologize we were we were at our my uncle Jonathan's meetings there in Ohio there in Lima this week so it's a busy weekend and so we drove I drove up this morning from Ohio but Lord willing hopefully next time if it if it works out they they can come with me and get to meet the meet y'all and so um but but Daniel 11:32 the Bible would say and such do wickedly against the Covenant shall he corrupt by flatteries but the people that do know their God shall be strong and do exploits what a promise amen can we bow our heads this morning dear gracious Heavenly Father Lord how we love you Lord and and we're grateful father for this this opportunity to come into your house Lord and for just having a place that we can come to and worship Lord with a freedom and a liberty Lord today God we have needs God be maybe there's afflictions in the body Lord whatever it is Father only you can meet the these needs and these desires father Lord I ask that you would speak this morning Lord speak to these lips of clay father Lord I ask that you would just discern the Heart by Your Word father and just and just meet the need and encourage father strengthen and uplift today Father Lord we we commit the service into your hands I I Lay My Gift into your hands Lord and ask that you would just move today we ask these things in your precious name amen you may be seated this morning and if I had a a simple subject it would be the people that know their God and brother brandom he would place this scripture at the end time and he he would say this here that uh and Daniel said in the day in that day they run run to and fro and knowledge shall increase and he said the wise shall know their God in that day and shall do great exploits in that day but the wicked will not know the god of Heaven they know him in a form and in a ritual so I believe that knowing God is more than just a form more than just a ritual but I believe that it's an experience that you can that you can come and contact with the supernatural being and see that there's a living presence Among Us not just an idea not just an opinion but there's something living right Among Us and and brother Brandon would tell us that the Holy Ghost has been bound for 2,000 years but is to be loosed by the by an evening time message he would say the Holy Ghost has been B by these denominational Rivers for almost 2,000 years but is to be loosed in the evening time by the evening time message the Holy Spirit back in the church again Christ himself revealed in human flesh in the evening time he promised it he said it and he promised it so the veil that has hid God and has kept him from the people I believe has been loosed in this generation by a message that there can be a people that know him more than just an idea or or just coming to church and and singing songs and raising our hands and and that's wonderful and things but I want to know my God I want to experience him I want to feel him in the hard times in the tough times when I go through trials when I go through circumstances I want more than just a feeling I want something real and brother Brandon would saying I think today we've had much fine preaching many fine ministers able ministers that has brought us the word your pastors and evangelists and so forth that comes through the city but I think the main thing that I'm trying to bring to you is the reality of the presence of Christ that you might see him and know that it's him by his identified promise for today so he says what I'm trying to do is to bring to you the realities of the presence of Jesus Christ and so reality is something that you can see something that you can feel something that that it's tangible it's God with flesh on it as brother Brandon would put it it's something that you can grab a hold of and say I've got it in the hardest time in the deepest time I got it and brother Brandon would say that you might see him and know that it is him so we have to we had to have something identify what Jesus really is because we're living in America where there's churches on every corner almost you know and everybody is claiming to have Christ everybody has the same Bible everybody's claiming to have the Holy Ghost in their church but who is the right one What doctrine is the right Doctrine what church has the truth and brother Brandon he lets us know the secret that you might see him and know that it is him by his identified promise for today and so it's not that it's our pastor getting up and saying this is truth we're following it it was thus saith the Lord and a pillar of Fire coming and vindicating it and letting you know that I am here revealing my presence to you that you can know me by the power of the Resurrection not just hoping that you know me but there's an identification in this day that you can take back the scripture and say right here it's prophesied in these days that there would be a prophet Malachi 4 that return my heart back to the back to the faith of the fathers and so once we see prophecy in this generation fulfilling what was in the book then we can understand that this is Jesus Christ oh this ain't just an idea not just an opinion but here is the Revelation the reality of the presence of Jesus then we can know him you know brother Brandon would tell the story of the little boy that wanted to see wanted to see God y y'all remember the story and he would come up to his mom and would say mom can anybody see God and she would say no sir or she would say go ask the Sunday school teacher and he would go up to the Sunday school teacher and would say teacher can anybody see God and she would say no son nobody can see God and live this boy boy was discouraged and heartbroken why serve a God that you can't see then he would go up to the to the preacher and would say preacher can anybody see God and he would say no son nobody can see God and live and this boy was discouraged he was walking down this Trail by this Lake and brother Brandon would tell us that there was an old fisherman that was sitting in a boat and this boy would run into the boat jump on his lap and this man was looking up at a rainbow and had tears coming down his face and he would say Sir can anybody see God and he would say son all I have seen is God for the past 35 years this man was not walking by natural sight but was walking by a revelation that the presence of Jesus Christ is here on Earth and I can see him and what is so incredible is here the preacher may have been looking at the same rainbow the Sunday school teacher was looking at the same rainbow mama was looking at the same rainbow and all she seen maybe was clouds all they seen was colors but this man with Revelation could look at a rainbow and know that this is Jesus Christ This Is God and you see once you get a revelation that Jesus is upon the Earth you can look at the same things that the world looks at but it reveals to you that it's Jesus Christ oh you can go through the trials and that trial reveals to you that he is with me oh you see you would never know that God could heal if you never was sick and it's the same sickness that discourages the unbeliever that brings the faith in your life knowing that he's Jehovah Gyra he's Jehovah Rafa he is all of these Redemptive names to me you see everybody can look at the same things and brother Brandon would say what do you see when you look you see cuz you can look at something but what are you seeing what are you beholding what are you understanding you see and brother Brandon would tell us that he would preach the message called looking to the Unseen looking under Jesus and brother Brandon was say another the people look at the word literally and that's the way you are supposed to look but it declares itself both both literally and spiritually the spirit makes the to live to the promise in other words it's a seed the spirit gives it life and and it G like the rain gives the gives to the seed that is buried in the ground it breaks forth life and he says when you look at Jesus the promised word of the hour then it will be revealed to you if you look at him you'll see that he's the same yesterday today and forever the same Christ and so we're not just looking up the word now naturally but we want to see it spiritually which is revelation you see brother Brandon would say he would tell us that there that there is there's two men in us he said there's the inward man which is the soul and he says then there's the outward man which is your eyes and he says your eyes is dictated by your flesh and so if you're going through circumstances and you're looking through your natural eyes and you look at the chaos you look at the hard times and if you're looking through those eyes instead of the eyes of faith it's going to bring you down right it's going if you're constantly looking at the negative it's going to discourage you if you're constantly looking up the chaos it's going to discourage you but if you look by faith you can look up the chaos and see even though I'm walking through the valley of the shadow of death I fear no evil so it depends on how you are looking when you look oh Hallelujah cuz if you look at naturalize at this a message we can be deep to right cuz there's websites there's critics there's naysayers that are saying all of these things against the message so if we look through naturalize sometimes it can be believable right if we if we're looking for faults and looking for mistakes brother the Brandon would tell us if you come to church expecting to criticize he says don't worry the devil will give you plenty to criticize but he says if you're coming expecting to see God move don't worry you're going to seek him so if you look at the message to criticize it don't worry the devil is going to give you something to criticize but I say I'm not looking to criticize I'm looking through eyes of faith that I can see the realities of the presence of Jesus Christ oh I believe that's your desire this morning I want to see the realities of Jesus Christ oh it's the realities that are going to save our children oh thank you brother it's the realities that is going to get get us in a Rapture that that brother Brandon was saying we are told that we have an outward man and an inward man the outward man looks by his eyes and the inward man walks by faith so we are led by one of these two persons outside the outward man the inward man is God you see we do not see with their eyes though many times we thought we see with their eyes we only look with their eyes but we see with our hearts ain't that incredible we look with our eyes but we see with our heart and we see that seeing is to understand cuz it was Jesus that were look to Nicodemus I believe and would say list a man is born again he cannot see the kingdom of God and brother Brandon would say that see means to understand and so we can see scripture but I don't want to just see it I want to understand it you see because understanding brings a revelation that goes beyond what you see you remember whenever it was Elisha and servant Gesa I believe that was there and they were surrounded by the Syrian Army you remember the story and the Bible would tell us that the boy would look out and would see that they were surrounded by the armies and would run back to Elisha and when they were surrounded by the Army what are we going to do and Elisha will look at him and would say there's more with us than they are with them so here stood the boy looking naturally could you imagine being this young boy could you imagine looking out of the tent and saying man all it is is me I'm a young boy and an old man and there's trained men out there with with swords with Spears with armor there's no way we're going to make it out alive and what would the prophet say open this Poor Boy's eyes his eyes was already open oh I'm preaching now his eyes were already open but his faith was blocked off by what he was seeing naturally and I say we need to stop walking by natural sight and walk by faith that looks beyond the condition that looks beyond what we're going through to a promise that no matter what I go through I'm with you every step of the way oh Hallelujah so what would happen when this boy's eyes would be open he would look that there was Chariots of Fire there was angels that were surrounding him no matter the condition that he was in when he changed his Focus from naturally to spiritually he would see into an unseen realm that there were angels with me oh and I don't believe it's by coincidence that you are still here with your right mind that you're not in prison that you're not in a jail cell somewhere that you're not in a grave somewhere it was the Unseen World it was angels that was guiding you every step of the way oh do you believe that this morning you remember it was Jesus the Bible would tell us that it was after that he was tempted in the wilderness for 40 days that the Bible say says once the devil left him then there came ministering Angels oh there came ministering Angels you know but the Bible would tell us that whenever Jesus was upon the cross for the Brandon would say all he had to do was move his hand a certain way and there would be Legion Legions of angels that would bring him off the cross y remember him saying that so it was Angels even though he was at his weakest moment there was Angels oh and even though when he felt like he was by himself the angels of God were still there the Bible would say that the uh it would talk they would talk about uh Elijah whenever he got tired remember that and brother Brandon would dramatize it and would say that God would look down and would say my servant Elijah is tired I need the angels I need an angel with the softest hand to go down and massage his shoulders to stroke his brow even though Elijah was tired he was running for his life there was an unseen realm that he could not see naturally that there was a ministering Angel oh Hallelujah you may feel tired this morning you may feel like you you can't take another step but in the Unseen realm there's ministering angels that is guiding you walking with you keeping you every step of the way oh Hallelujah we might not see them naturally but if you look through the eyes of Faith you will see that there are angels God is walking with us every step of the way brother brand going say this when God made man he made him first for he for he made this little this little certain compartment in man for his own Throne his control tower God wants to lead man but man wants to lead himself therefore the war is constantly the man wants to go after what he sees with his eyes that is where he is deceived he says that's where Satan deceived Eve was by what she could see the fruit was more Pleasant to the eye but it was death to the soul he says so it is tonight God wants to lead man so he made himself a little control tower in the midst of his heart so that man would be led by the spirit of God getting off on his own leading is what separated him from his Fellowship looking at what he could see with his eyes ain't that incredible but the brandom is saying God wants to lead man but there's a war between man and God because man is trying to lead himself by what he sees oh and it's hard sometimes I'm sure the elders can witness it that it's hard sometimes you've been through some hard times you've been through some circumstances and it's easy to walk by walk by faith or walk by sight instead of by faith and brother brandom is saying that is what deceives man is walking by your sight oh my and I say let's change our Focus let's change our eyesight cuz brother the Brandon would say that it's only only a special class of people that can know God only a special class of people and he says it's because he would say what would identify him would be identification of the scripture that says he would be and so it's somebody that is not looking naturally but is looking through eyes of faith that can see him he would say you would recall that I mentioned at the beginning of this message that this book we are studying is the actual revelation of Jesus himself in the church and his work in the future ages then I mentioned that it takes the Holy Spirit to give us Revelation or we fail to get it bringing these two thoughts together that you will see it it won't take just ordinary study and thinking to make this book real it's going to take the operation of the Holy Ghost that means this book can't be revealed to anyone but a special class of people it will take one with prophetic Insight what is that prophetic Insight it's the it's the inward man looking by faith at the word of God and seeing that this is Jesus Christ being revealed he said it's going to take more than just comparing verse with verse you know why because brother Brandon would say there's so many people with different opinions of who Christ is he would say you be surprised to know all of the opinions of who who they think Christ is he says some of them look looked at Jesus and says he's a wonderful teacher he says some looked at him and said he was a wonderful scholar and a philosopher and he says certainly he was those things but he was a teacher plus Oh I thought that was so powerful he says he was that what the what their natural eyes were looking at he was that but he was more than that you see he would say this should be surprised to know what some of their opinions are some of them thinks he was just a wonderful teacher well he was was there that's just exactly many thingss he was a great philosopher which he was there certainly he was some of them thinks he was a good man he was but he was more than that he was all of that plus some of them think he was a prophet he was a prophet but he was more than a prophet he was what a prophet was plus and so if you if you've got the ability to walk by faith you are this prophetic people that has prophetic Insight looking at Jesus today ain't that incredible that not anybody can look at him the right way but the predestinated so if you've got a desire on the inside and you're walking by faith you that you should be you you have a right to Rejoice because you're not anybody has the leading no the Bible would say that uh nobody comes to the father unless the father draws him the word draw is an inward pulling so nobody can come unless there's an inward pull to his bleeding side so if there's an inward pull you should have you have a right to praise God cuz not anybody is being pulled the Bible would say if I be lifted up I will draw all men unto me and so it is the predestinated that is looking what has been lifted up in this generation and inwardly they're being pulled oh Hallelujah that they can see the realities of Jesus Christ oh hallelujah it's not you doing it you're just being pulled inward by predestination and you're just walking by faith you're walking by faith every step of the way oh Hallelujah but it's a special class of people that can identify him by his promised word today not by what not by what uh brother brandham was wearing not what the word was wearing in the flesh of brother brandom but you can look past the Flesh and see it was more than a prophet in this generation it was brother Brandon pointing to something oh Hallelujah you see if I say look look at this TV screen right there your attention is first upon me right then it goes from me to what I'm pointing to right cuz now I I'm the attraction I say look but then the attraction goes from me to what I'm pointing at and brother Brandon would say the attraction was John the Baptist he was the attraction but whenever Jesus came he says the attraction went from the prophet to the prophecy so when brother random came here was the attraction the first two PS were were the the the visions and the the healing on the hand the vibrations but the third pole was the opening of the word pointing you to Jesus Christ the realities of his presence is upon the Earth today look at him oh seek Him by faith that he is here today by his revealed word of the hour oh Hallelujah you got to look past the flesh and see that Jesus was here today you remember when Nathaniel met Jesus it wasn't what Jesus was wearing that revealed to Nathaniel that he was the Christ it was whenever he discerned the heart you remember it was Philip that would run to Nathaniel and would say here here's a man here this is the Messiah and I could just and brother Brandon would sort of dramatize it that he might have been critical are you sure that this is the Messiah and when he ran up to Jesus Jesus looked at him and said behold an Israelite with no gal and here stood Nathaniel and thought how do you know me and he says whenever you was under the under the fig tree before Philip called Thee I saw you and so it wasn't the Garment that what Jesus was wearing that revealed it to Nathaniel it was prophecy being fulfilled oh Hallelujah so don't matter what preacher is is preaching behind this pull pit if it's the word coming across it is Jesus Christ to you oh you see what if Nathaniel would have looked at Jesus and says now you're not wearing the right clothes you should be wearing this type of garment your sandals should be this type of way your hair should be this type of weight if he was looking up the Garment he would have failed to see that this was scripture being fulfilled I hope this is okay this morning and so many times we look at the gift that is behind the pull pit and we think oh it's just the pastor we're not going to see God move it's just the Evangelist we're not going to see God move oh it's just this one we're not going to see God move you got to look beyond the flesh look beyond the Garment that is preaching and see that it's a message that is being lifted up that will inwardly draw you oh Hallelujah stop looking at the Garment and look at the word brother Brandon would say but what would identify him would be the identification that the scripture says that he would be he would say that's how we have to identify him and that's the way he was identified then because he wasn't any spectacular man in a certain array of dress he had no organization that he boasted of he had no credentials from any certain Fellowship that he could say I belong to the biggest he had only the works of God that was proven and spoken of that would identify him that was his credentials ain't that powerful he says his credentials wasn't n what he was wearing his credentials was what the word spoke of him and he was fulfilling the word that's what his credentials were and I say we got the credentials in this generation we had a Prophet come with Vindication after Vindication the Messiah sign letting you know that Jesus Christ is upon Earth again not not the man William Brandon I don't believe in deifying the man but I do believe he was pointing to something oh he was the John the Baptist pointing that here comes the Messiah here he comes oh what would brother brandom say that that the purpose of his ministry is to declare to you that he is here that he is here not a million miles away but he is here and you can experience the realities of it but you see once you identify what where he is at today that produces such a faith that you know that you're right right how many's ever been in in an AR argument before and you just know that you're right you know that you're right but then the other person pulls out their phone and Googles it and you're wrong how many's ever been there before you lose all your confidence cuz you just thought that you was right and that's the way it is with this message the devil can come and put questions in Your Mind questions in your mind but if you've never seen it Vindicated then you're not going to know if it's true or not oh come on now but once you identify it that this is scripture this ain't a man's message it's scripture then you can go toe to- Toe with the devil and say oh I don't care what you say I don't care what the critic say I don't care what the naysayers say I have identified by scripture and I can see that it is Jesus Christ there's a confidence when you know that you are right brother brand I'm going talk about Dave and I say all he had was a little piece of leather a little sheep skin and some sticks and he said but it was Revelation that he had and he says it was revealed guilty him and he says God took me out of the Paw of the lion out of the Paw of the bear and he can take me out of this uncircumcised Philistine hand he says it was revealed to him and what was so incredible I think about it is brother Brandon would say that Saul was Head and Shoulders above above all the rest of the army but it wasn't revealed to him ain't that incredible the power of Revelation here stood Saul through naturalize was more capable of fulfilling the promise more capable of destroying the Philistine but since it wasn't revealed to him he could not do it oh that's the power Revelation you got to know that this message is my message oh come on now you see we can look at that in a negative way but we can also look at it in the positive here stood a man that was Head and Shoulders that should be able to fulfill the word but then also was a little boy that naturally was not able right you look at David and think man there's no way this guy can bring down the Philistine there's no way but we can also take encouragement from that we can look at ourselves many times and see I'm just a mama oh I'm just a daddy I'm just somebody that goes to work I'm just a teenager and we think that we're not able to fulfill the promise of the hour but look at David if it can be revealed to David that God can bring him through you can get that same Revelation that I can be the embodiment of deity in this gener ation bringing forth the promise you know brother Brandon would say that that said brother Brandon would say that he would talk about the Tabernacle and would say behind those Badger skins was the shik glory he says it was once Badgers behind those skins and then he would say now it's no longer badgers or animals but now it's the housing place for the shik glory and he says so can your skins be changed into the housing place for the Shak glory in other words de deity is no longer just behind the veil deity is no longer just in a prophet but deity can be put into your skins oh Hallelujah it can be a young boy a mama or a daddy a pastor that is no longer just me walking by natural sight but it's deity on the inside leading me every step of the way we know our God we know our God in the hard times we know him in the good times we know him oh it's Revelation brother brandham says talking about David in that same quote he says his brothers were more able to do it Saul Head and Shoulders above his army but you see it was not revealed to them oh my amen there it is they believed that could be done but they believed God could do it but it wasn't revealed to them ain't that incredible they knew God could do it but they could not believe that he can do it through them and that's a big tactic that the devil brings against against lay members how many's ever felt that before that I can't do it it's just the pastor's message only the pastor can overcome only the Deacon can overcome only mama can overcome or daddy and you see here stood Saul and David's Brothers hiding behind the rocks and here come David you see that's the tactic of the enemy he knows if he can keep you under under that under those voices he can rise up his head in your home and you won't defy it oh come on now now here stood an uncircumcised Philistine that was defying and cursing the armies of God and here stood men that was capable of bringing him down but since it wasn't revealed to them they were hiding behind the rocks and brother brandom says there were still goliaths today but there were still Davids here as well and so goliaths are always going to pop up their head I may be unconfessed sins or pornography or gossip whatever it is but if you are if you don't got a revelation that this message for you you're going to let those goliaths run your home oh run your marriage run your children's life run the church whatever it is but somebody's got to get some gumption about them and say this is my word this is my Revelation this is the presence of Jesus for me Hallelujah and oh I just love the story I know it's simple story but David would say who is this uncircumcised Philistine and everybody else was afraid of oh man we're living in a day of people's rights we're living in a day of a of a cancel culture you know I'm sure you'all heard of that phrase phrase up here if you don't like something you can just cancel it right you know if you don't like what somebody's saying just cancel him and that's and that's the tactic of the enemy that he tries to bring that into homes where you can't say anything against that Spirit it come to the pull Pit Where where the devil makes you afraid to stand up against the spirit it's the cancel culture trying to get you to bow down to the enemies that is coming against your home your life your mind but David would stand up and would say who is this guy who is this spirit and here stood everybody else saying don't say anything about it you're going to make him mad Here Comes The Devil whispering in your ear don't don't stand up against the television you're going to make the enemy mad don't stand up against the gossip Spirit you're going to make this one over here mad but David didn't care about the voice voes he knew that that was an uncircumcised Philistine that was trying to destroy his home trying to destroy his family's life and I say little church it's time to get courage about us and see I don't care what the enemy is saying I've got a revelation of who I am in this generation I'm not just some cast away but I'm The Virtuous the blood wash prde of Jesus Christ that's who you are oh you're not some passed away God chose you oh Hallelujah you're not somebody that is an afterthought that you're just an accident being here but God predestinated you but the brand I'm would say that God planned you Generations back through your great great grandfather great great grandmother all the way down to you here so that you would have the right color hair he would know the color eyes that you would have so if he would work naturally to get you to look a certain way what about spiritually oh Hallelujah God knew you would be here in this generation so he would give a message and would call your name and inwardly draw you oh Hallelujah you see I don't believe anybody's here by accident oh come on now I don't believe that I don't believe you're just here with no gifts with no callings that you can't do nothing about it I believe if you're here God's got a plan for your life the Bible would say gifts gifts and callings are without repentance gifts and callings many people think I'm just taking my Liberty hope this is okay brother many people think well I can't sing so I'm not called I can't preach I'm not called I can't play any instruments I'm not called I can't do this I'm not called but the Apostle Paul would separate the two gifts and callings are without repentance so you might not be able to sing but that don't mean you're not called oh come on now you might not not be able to play music play the piano or the flute but that don't mean you're not called God still has a plan for you and a predestinated will for you to fulfill oh Hallelujah but it's by Revelation that we can see where we are in this generation and you remember the two that would walk on walk on the road to Emmas they were talking about Jesus in a day gone by and I think it's so incredible that they were talking about all the negative things around them and and the Bible would say that the two the two ladies come to the SRE where Jesus was y'all remember that and here they come and the Bible says they were perplexed and the word perplexed means confused or or or or at a loss and here they came at a loss and I love how the Bible would put it the Angels would stand there with the message and would say why are you seeking the living among the dead and what were the what what were they looking through the confused State they were they were perplexed and so they would come looking through natural eyes confused and since they were confused they were looking for a living God among Dead traditions oh that many times we can make this message a dead tradition come on now this message will never denominate but that don't mean you can't denominate it to yourself you can be looking you can be so focused on the negativity around the message that you're looking for a living God among Dead traditions oh but I say this message is not a dead letter it's the Living God to this generation to inwardly draw you and pull out a bride for his name's sake oh and here would here they would be they would come and the Bible would say that the angel speak a message to them and would remind them of what Jesus said and it's so incredible because he would start to bring back to remembrance what Jesus himself said and the Bible would say and they remembered his words so here they would be conf be confused and perplexed but once the message would come to them it would bring them out of that confused State and they will remember the words that was prophesied oh you might be confused this morning but we've got a message that is reminding you of what the word says I will never leave you I would never forsake you but I will be with you all the way to the end of the age remember his words wo it's feeling good good up here remember his words don't be seeking a living God among Dead traditions remember his words now what's so incredible here goes these two ladies they would run away from the SRE and run to the disciples and now here's the disciples they were so focused upon all the negativity around them as well and the Bible says that here the here these two ladies would tell and testify to them what they had just seen y'all remember the story there Luke 24 I believe then the Bible says that the disciples looked at him and they heard these stories as Idol tales and believe them not oh man ain't that incredible here would come some witnesses from an angel saying he's not dead he's alive but because they were walking by natural eyes the stories of the supernatural seemed as Idol taals and so too many times somebody gets up and testifies and says I was once B by drugs and god Set Me Free I was bound by pornography and god Set Me Free but we're so focused on the negativity they seem as Idol Tales oh I'm preaching now but you notice then here we go the tooth from the emus they thought these were Idol Tales but now here they go they're walking to EMAs and they were talking about all the negativity how they thought this was the Messiah how that he was dead he was crucified then here would come Jesus Jesus would appear in their very midst and walk with them and I love how the Bible puts it the Bible says Jesus himself Drew near oh he didn't send an angel but Jesus himself oh and I saw another Mighty Angel come down from heaven with an open book yeah the Lord himself shall descend with the shout oh what is that shout it's a message coming to you and here the Bible says Jesus himself Drew near and started the talk with him and the Bible says he asked him what do he talking about and they look to Jesus himself and says are you a stranger in these parts you see with that Revelation Jesus is a stranger oh Hallelujah if you're walking by natural eyesight the Revelation the reality of Jesus is a stranger but the Bible says he rebuked them oh and sometimes the word has to rebuke you oh come on now thank God for a fivefold Ministry a pastor that ain't somebody that ain't afraid to take the word and through Spirits it was Jesus that was get grab the word and the Bible says he rebuked them and said oh fools and slow of heart to believe could you imagine if your pastor got up and done that would anybody be left you know what I mean you see where and here Jesus was so was so comp so compassionate about it he would say oh fools you're looking the wrong way don't be looking naturally but shouldn't the shouldn't the son of man be crucified didn't he SA these things and brother brandom says he was preaching to them but he they they could not seek him because they had to receive him you know brother Brandon would say that he says preaching the word won't bring Revelation you got to receive it and the Bible would tell us there would walk there were Jesus at the evening time acted like he was going to walk by their house you remember that and the Bible says they constrained him and said come in with us and right there once they received him in the put them in a position for the bread to be broke to them oh so once they received him in and the bread was broke what is that bread what did Jesus say I'm the living bread I'm the broken bread so once the bread was broke it open their eyes to Pro prophecy being fulfilled you see you got to look at it the right way the bread has been broke in this generation the seals have been loosed to let you know that the presence of Jesus Christ what would brother brandom say he would say he's the one that opened those seals he would talk about Mount Sunset and he would say it was quickening power to open those seals and he says what were those seals it was Jesus Christ he says the opening of those seals was Jesus Christ so it was that it was the Lord himself descending with the shout which was the message broken bread to open your eyes that Jesus Christ the reality of his presence is here today Hallelujah it is here to bring you through every problem to bring you through every trial to bring you through every every circumstance that you go through it's Jesus Christ walking with you and we know him you see not just walking with him I want to know him right I don't want him to be walking with me and I don't know him I want to know him in the power of his resurrection Hallelujah oh I want to know him maybe was zakus that would say I I I want to I want to see Jesus and who he is you remember that he didn't want to just seek him he wanted to seek who he was that should be our desires this morning I don't want to hear I don't want to just hear a sermon I want to see who he is I want to see who he is and the Bible would say that zakus would clim clim to the fork of the tree I I know we all know the story brother brandom says he came to the Old Testament and the New Testament man at the fork of the tree and then put him in a position for Jesus to notice him and you notice it wasn't him crying out to Jesus once he climbed up the tree it was Jesus Calling to him oh man if you ever look by faith it's no longer you saying oh man I don't understand it's God saying if you walk by faith I will inly draw you I will draw you there he was in that tree and here come Jesus that kid yes come down today for I must abide in your house I must abide the word abide is the take up residence Hallelujah so here Jesus says I must take up residence in your in your house but you notice the body of Jesus left right he he he he didn't live in that house but who he was dwelled there the revelation of Jesus the body left but the revelation of Jesus remained in that house we might not got the body of Jesus today but we've got the revelation of Jesus but the Brandon would say he is here in every aspect but the Corporal body oh ain't that an incredible thing we might not have his body but we got his presence and what would that Revelation do to zakus it would make some changes right it was zakus the Bible would say that he start to started to repay all of his debtors he would start to repay all of the ones that he done wrong it was the revelation of Jesus making some changes once he understood who he was it started to change his life and I believe there's a quickening power inside of this message that can change desires oh you want your teenagers to be saved lift up this message oh I'm preaching now you want to see a Revival in your home lift up this message there's a quickening power I would draw all men unto me brother Brandon would talk about the he would talk about the five boys that would go into the and go into the the the Navy y'all remember the story but the brandom says that the oldest got old enough he went into the Navy the second oldest went into the Navy all the way down to the fifth went into the Navy and the parents were were confused because they there was no there was no military service in their family nobody had been in the military and so they went and they were investigating it how come these boys wanted to go into the Navy when there's nobody in the family family and brother brandham says they would go into the bedroom and there was a picture that was upon the wall of a ship upon the ocean and brother brandham says every night before they went to bed they looked at that picture when they got up in the morning they looked at the picture when they went to bed they looked at their picture every day until they got old enough that would create a desire to join the Navy and brother brandom says if a natural picture would do that what about Jesus Christ if I be lifted up I will draw am men if a picture would do that naturally what would this message do if we lift it up if we lift it up above our children lift it up above our marriage lift it up in our house in our church it will draw all men and you notice what happened and changed the course of their family history ain't that incredible that nobody in their family was on the direction of military service until that picture was lifted up then once that was lifted up but change the course of their family Direction and this message can change the course of family history it can change the course of family curses it can change the course of generational curses that has passed from generation to generation you lift up this message it can change the course it's not a Del letter it's a living God it's a living presence and that's what I love about this message it's the mystery of God revealed it's no longer the blind leading the blind but it is the mystery of God revealed and brother Brandon will tell us that it's the revelation of God that gives us the authority over the devil it's the revelation of who God is because we got to know him the Bible would tell us uh let me find let me find the scripture here in Psalms 119 and 27 make me to understand the way of thy precepts and so shall I talk of thy wondrous works so be before we can declare his works we got to understand his precepts and so it was God revealing himself in this generation so that we can see and understand who he is and I believe that is what Daniel is talking about the people that know their God will do exploits the people that understand who their God is will be strong and do exploit and I think that's incredible because we're living in the day of illnesses we're living in the day of of spiritual family we're living in today but in the midst of that and if you read Daniel in that chapter it's it's speaking uh uh it's speaking of a famine it's speaking of curses it's speaking of how the worlds it's almost a depressing scripture but in the midst of that he stops and would say there's a people that know their God so in the midst of all of the chaos there was still an elected seed there that knows their God and they are strong oh and I believe there's still some people people that are strong in their faith they've been through some hard times but they are strong they've been through some storms but they are strong still you may say I feel pretty weary in my body that's not what we're looking at what about your faith what about your faith it was the Apostle Paul that would say I've ran my course I finished my race and I've kept the faith right I've kept my faith I've been through some hard times but I still got my faith why why would Jesus pray over Peter and would say the the the devil desires to sift you like wheat but I pray I prayed for you that you lose not your faith right how come he would pray for his faith that was a spiritual sight right how come he didn't pray that the devil would stop sifting him the word shft is the shake it's referring back to the wheat and you would shake the wheat and it would it would push off all of the all of the access stuff to get the seed and here Jesus prayed that he kept his faith cuz he knew if he kept his faith Faith he can make it through the shaken times oh and I don't believe he just prayed for Peter but he prayed for you as well that you lose not your faith he knew you would go through some hard times where you felt like you couldn't make it but he interceded for you we have a high priest that can't be fail by the feelings of our infirmities we don't got one that can't be failed we got somebody who can be fa he was tempted in all points like we are tempted yet without sin so that he could intercede for for you and pray for you that you lose not your faith oh Hallelujah and so it's Daniel saying somebody that knows their God is going to be strong and do exploits and brother Brandon would say this here and think of it not one believer of any age needs to cry in his heart oh that I might have been back there in the first age with the APO when the apostles were first sent out there was no need to look back look up and behold him who is even now walking in in the midst of the churches through all ages Behold Him who was the same yesterday today and forever who never changes either in essence or in his ways where two or three are gathered together in his name there he is in the midst and not only in their midst as an as a complacent onlooker or a recording Angel but there he stands expressing exactly what he is the life and sustainer and Giver of all good gifts to the church how Hallelujah ain't that incredible he says there's no need to look back and wish we was there in the first church age he says look up and behold what word behold means to look so if you can look at him and behold him you will understand that he's walking in the midst of this last church and the then you know the the midst is in the middle so he's not working walking at the beginning of the church age or just at the end of the church age on the side or on this side but he's walking in the midst of the church age with you every step of the way and the word behold means to look the Bible Will Tell Us in John 1:29 the next day John seeth Jesus coming unto him and saith Behold the Lamb of God which taketh away the sin of the world or other words look the Lamb of God here is the Fulfillment of Prophecy look at him and brother brandom says Behold Him who is even now walking in the midst look at him don't be so focused on everything you're going through but Behold Him don't be so focused on the rebellious teenager Behold Him don't be so focused on marital problems look at him Behold the Lamb that taketh away the sins of the world you see because once you recognize him that releases exploits to you and it's so incredible cuz brother Brandon would say this and he was see and she saw what he was talking about Mary Magdalene the the Mary that would wash the the feet of Jesus and he said she saw it and she recognized his presence what did it do it washed what did it released to her forgiveness it released to her forgiveness of her sins so here once she recognized the presence of Jesus it would open up a channel for exploits to come oh you want to see the supernatural inside of your life recognize that he's on Earth today that's what this message is pointing you to a living God recognize that he's here for me you see because it was it was Simon that would invite Jesus to his house but he didn't make him feel welcome y' brother Brandon would preach at the unrecognized presence of Jesus he would he would talk about how Simon left him there in the in the corner with dirty feet but here would come this this little woman that was unworthy she was so scarred she was she was messed up she had addictions if there was anybody that did not have a right to be in the presence of Jesus it was this woman and here stood the perfect ones Simon the priest no Faults against him but yet he did not have nothing inside of him to recognize who he was oh you may see I've got faults I got mistakes I've got failures that don't matter if you got to see it on the inside it's inwardly pulling you and here would go this lady with scars and mistakes and condemnation maybe she was walking with her head down ashamed of who she was ashamed of her life ashamed the mistakes and choices that she made but there was something on the inside of her heart that would start to draw her and she would look inside of this door and when see somebody see a man just sitting there with dirty feet and she would look and see more than a man but it was her forgiveness she would see more than a man but it was her Liberation she would see more than a man it was her freedom from for from from condemnation from from The Prostitute life it was her freedom and I say little church this is more than a message it is your Liberation it's your rapture it's your body change what do you see when you look at it oh it's your salvation for your children it's your body change it's your sound of mind what do you see when you look at it oh hallelujah it's more than a letter friends it's the reality of Jesus and here she looked whenever she looked and recognized who that was it would release to her forgiveness the very thing she desired most it would be a channel opened up to her and brother Brandon would say this the body of Christ is one Spirit where every member from Pentecost to this time drinks of the same new wine the same Holy Ghost bringing forth the same results how do we do it by one spirit it's God's open door it's the Holy Spirit what is it it's God's open door it's a sign it's a seal it's a comforter it's an advocate it's an assurance it's a rest it's peace it's goodness it's healing it's life it's God's open door to all of those things what is it's the presence of God and here this was God's open door to this lady her forgiveness would walk through that door and brother brandom is saying it's God's open door to you is all of these things he says your healing your peace it's goodness whatever you have need of it's God's open door that you could just walk right through it and I say this morning whatever your need is it's God's open door it's God's Open Door whether the brand I'm going talk about the the woman at the woman at the whale but the brandom saw the Bible would say I have needs to go by Samaria I have needs what was that it was predestination she he knew that there was somebody there that needed him it was pred a predestinated seed that was pulling out to him and I think it's so incredible that here he would bypass all of everybody else he didn't come to the to the well when all the virgins was there but he came to the well whenever he was The Prostitute he came to the well whenever it was somebody that wasn't even even could be there with the rest of the other virgins but brother Brandon would say this now what did this putting the old scripture with that experience that Jesus was given to her what did it do it made the Messiah and did you notice quickly her sins were forgiven because at the beginning she was redeemable she was in God's thinking at the beginning so it redeemed her or brought her back when she seen this expressed scripture manifested of Jehovah what he was what he is oh Hallelujah so whenever he says I have needs to go by Samaria there was a predestined needed seed he had to reveal himself to oh so whenever this little woman could you imagine just put yourself in this lady's shoes for a second she couldn't be with the rest of the virgins she couldn't be with the rest of the married women she had to go to the well at a different time and could you imagine she's walking out of her home and here would come all the other ladies walking back to their homes and I'm sure they're talking about her right cuz people like to talk right people like to talk it was job that would say when is the VIN talking going to cease he's there on the ash Heap and his friends were talking about him talking about him talking about him and it's incredible he says when is the VIN talking going to cease but anyways here it come here would go these ladies I'm sure going back to their homes and here would this this little lady walk out of her home and maybe she's thought oh man here they're going to see me they're going to talk about me and I could just imagine these ladies oh there's that one again where she go oh she's going to the well we better hurry up we got to make sure we're not even even associated with her and here would come this lady walking by maybe she was ashamed with her head down thinking my goodness why have I made these choices why have I made these mistakes and here she would go up to the well and here would stand Jesus and look at her and say give me something to drink and maybe you shocked her and when she we have no we have no dealings with each other you're a Jew you're you're you're you're different we're not even supposed to be together and I can imagine that these other girls were getting to their homes and look back oh look at her she's with a man up there we know what she's like we know what what her what what her line of work is and maybe they're criticizing but little did they know it wasn't little did they know it was a predestinated seed coming in contact with the living presence to open up a channel that she could be redeemed back to a spotless State and here she would be sitting there and Jesus would start to talk with her brother brandom said he was trying to connect with her spirit and whenever he would start to talk with her something would register and she would say wait a second something's different about you whenever the Messiah comes he will do these things whenever she looks she seen something different when the Messiah comes he would do these things and he would say I am he and what would she do the very things that she was arguing with Jesus about she would drop cuz the Bible would say he looked to her when say give me something to drink she would start to we got no dealings with each other and he would say if you knew who I was you would ask a me to drink and what would she say you've got no buckets to draw with right the the well is deep how are you going to get water and whenever she seen that this was the Messiah what's the Bible say she dropped her buckets she dropped the very thing that was keeping her from seeing the presence of Jesus she dropped it and I see whatever it is that is hindering you from seeing the supernatural you can drop it this morning if it's condemnation you can drop it if it's if it's hidden sins you can drop it if what if it's blood pressure if it if if it's things coming against your mind that is keeping you from seeing the realities you can drop it this morning oh it's a living presence that has come to deliver it's God's Open Door she dropped her water bucket she dropped it and said come come see a man and could you imagine a heo these critics that was just criticizing her now she comes running by him saying come see a man come see a man and what's so incredible is the Bible says that the men of the city believed on Jesus because of the woman's reports so here's here's the husbands of these critics could could do you think that these ladies would allow their husbands to even be near this lady no but what changed exploits exploits changed she once had what she once had actions of a prostitute she had actions of unbelief but once she recognized Jesus it changed her actions from that of a prostitute to that of exploits of faith that here she would run and say go what would she use to witness come see a man who is told me all the things that I ever done she would use her past mistakes to bring that the the to to bring that City to a living reality you see that's what the devil wants to do in your life is to make you ashamed of where God brought you from oh come on now that's how condemnation works you know my dad has a saying he my brother W Martin's the pastor there he's my dad and he would say the devil talks you into robber in the bank then calls the police on you right how true is that the devil makes a mistake makes you trip up and causes you to make mistakes and then he brings condemnation upon you you see he wants you to be ashamed of where God brought you from he wants you to be ashamed of how God delivered you he wants you to be ashamed but this little lady wasn't ashamed oh she was liberated she was free come see a man that has told me all the things that I ever done and you notice what what what things did he even tell her that she had five husbands well like how how did she know that he knew all the other things it was Revel that if she could bring if he can tell me these things and brother Brandon would say if he could tell you the past don't you think he can tell you the future and they were in a prayer line he was starting to discern a a lady's life and would tell her I think at her address tell her how how she got the yness and then would stop and say don't you think if God can tell you your past what about your future so she knew that he could tell of the the past nothing's hidden oh little church and I believe that we had a had a word in this generation that didn't just take us to the mind of God but also took us to the Future and we see hey I seen you there job where were you when the sons of God shouted for Joy it was job that had a revelation but then what would that Revelation do then that Revelation would lift him up and would say and at that day in my flesh I will see God so that Revelation didn't just take him back to the mind of God but it took him to the Future h oh hope you're hearing me this morning this Revelation didn't just take us back to predestination that God knew you but it also took you to the Future it says you are my bride you're rapturing material no matter what you've been through what you're going through there's nothing that can change the course for your life oh hallelujah it's exploits quickly her sins were forgiven because at the beginning she was redeemable because she was in God's thinking at the beginning that's why you're here this morning cuz at the beginning you was redeemable that's all it is that's what predestination is predestination ain't a crutch that gives you free will to sin predestination is you were redeemable at the beginning and since you're redeemable there's a little voice on the inside that says man why am I here why am I even here just like the the woman up the well are aring with Jesus but then something registered when the Messiah comes he's going to do these things that's what predestination does you may fall but you get back up and say Lord I'm sorry but I know something's different about this word something's different about this word oh Hallelujah and it can open up a channel AM you see that's what exploits are exploits ain't always speaking in tongues exploits ain't always seeing visions right exploits ain't always you know prophesying or or dancing in the aisles you know I've never prophesied before I've never seen a vision I've never spoken tongues before does that mean I don't have exploits you see exploits is more than those things exploits sometimes is just the life yes exploits and sometimes come see a man who has told me all that I ever done I've got mistakes I've got no I've got nothing I can point to but there's one thing there's something different about my life and maybe that's all you can point point to this morning maybe you can't point to something special but if you've got something inside of your heart that is drawing you it's exploits it's special what would what would Jesus what would Jesus tell uh he would tell uh uh Nathaniel or yet Nathaniel whenever he whenever he would reveal to him that he had seen him under the tree there in John 1: 147 do Jesus saw Nathaniel come to him and saith of him behold an Israelite of indeed in whom is no gal Nathaniel saith unto him whence thou knowest me Jesus answered and said unto him before that Philip called thee when thou were under the fct tree I saw Thee the 50th verse Jesus answered and said unto him because I said unto thee I saw thee under the Fig Tree believest thou Thou shalt see greater things than these in other words I'm not just revealing to you that I always knew you that I seen you but there's some things for you to see in your life oh this me this message has come to you it says I haven't just called you but I brought you here to produce exploits the Bible would say in John 15:16 you have not chosen me but I chosen you and ordained you that you should go and bring forth fruit and your fruit should remain that whatsoever you ask in my father's name he may give it to you and that really spoke to me brother John you have not chosen me but I've chosen you and ordained you look up the grace of God and ordained you to bring forth fruit that your fruit should remain that whatsoever you ask you see many people want to have the spoken word and think that's exploits that is but here Jesus is saying I've chosen you to have fruit that your life should remain that whatsoever you ask many people put the carp in front of the horse they want to do the spoken word they want to speak it and that's fine that comes with it but don't forget to live the life don't forget to have the exploits that there's a life that has been changed that this message is no longer in tape form and book form but it's in flesh form you have not chosen me but I chose you when you was unable to choose me I chose you think about that for a second and I'm bringing this to a close think about that for a second when we was unable to choose God we was unable to grasp this message this message grabbed us it was Peter that would lie Curse God I'm going say I don't know the man I don't know him and what it was and his intentions were so good I you know I I think it was because of predestination he wanted to do good it was Jesus that would say Peter you're going to lie you're going to curse me three times and he would say no Lord I'll go with you to the death but under the pressure there was nothing on the inside yet he had not been born again yet but then here he was can you imagine the condemnation that was on his mind and his heart there he was in a boat naked fishing thinking I just cursed them I just cursed the Messiah I just cursed Jesus I denied that I even knew him but then all of a sudden he hears a voice Peter hey Peter and here he is you know he's in condemnation upon this boat condemning himself why would I if I had to do it all over again I would stand up for him I don't care what they would do to me Peter and he's he's blazing he's drowning out that voice with condemnation beating him up right I do that why did I do that Peter and all of a sudden I can just imagine that there's a voice you know and it was hey Peter I got a message for you I met Jesus I met Jesus and you know what Jesus told me he told me go tell my disciples and Peter and here would stand Peter Jesus remembered me he remembered me even though I cursed even though I I fa to stand up for him even though I ran against he still remembered me it was the grace of God saying Peter I already knew you would go through it but I see you here on the other side of it redeemable oh little church don't beat yourself up with condemnation why did I make this mistake why did I make that mistake here was a voice crying out to you this morning that God already knew you would make it but knew you was redeemable he knew you would make mistakes he knew you would have fail he knew you would have addictions but he knew you was redeemable he knew maybe you would turn away from this message but he knew you was redeemable let our musicians come this morning you have not chosen me but I chose you Peter when you was unable to choose me I chose you when you was unable to remember me I remembered you when you was unable to stand up for me I stood up for you oh Hallelujah he stood up he stood that's the favor of God you see the favor of God don't just don't don't have an expiration date because you make mistakes that's right the favor of God is always there and theel before Nathaniel ever knew that Jesus was even upon the Earth Jesus already saw him how powerful is that before he before Nathaniel or Phillip ever came to him Jesus already seen him there before a preacher ever got up behind this pull pit and preached to you the promises of God God already saw you how incredible is that that here stood Nathaniel in this state of not even knowing the presence of God is on Earth and God already saw him so before you you ever came to this message maybe you was in a Catholic church or or a Baptist or Pentecostal church maybe you was an atheist before you even knew anything about the realities of of God God already saw you and I believe it was because God saw him Nathaniel under inspiration or Phillip under inspiration would go to Nathaniel and would say hey come see this man come see it and I believe that your pastor gets up and preaches by inspiration the promises of God CU God already saw you don't take for granted that you got a pastor here that believes this message it's a Phillip coming to a Nathaniel saying the Messiah is here the the promise is being fulfilled and God already saw you oh little church don't get weary and well doing he's here let's bow our heads this morning dear heavenly father
