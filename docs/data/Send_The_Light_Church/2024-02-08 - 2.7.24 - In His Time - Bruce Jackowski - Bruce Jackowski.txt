are possible Jesus is here Jesus is here Jesus is here all things are possible Jesus is here amen amen amen amen if you'll turn with me this uh evening to uh Ecclesiastes chapter 3 it's right after the Book of Proverbs if you have trouble finding it amen just want to read one scripture from here Ecclesiastes 3: 1 to everything there is a season and a time to every purpose under the heaven amen and then want to turn over to Galatians over in the New Testament want to go to Galatians 6 starting at verse 7 be not deceived G God is Not mocked for whatsoever a man Seth that shall shall he also reap for he that Seth to his flesh shall of the flesh reap corruption but he that sth to the spirit shall of the spirit reap life Everlasting let us not be weary and well-doing for in due season we shall reap if we faint not amen and as we have therefore opportunity let us do good unto all men especially unto them who are of the household of faith amen far ahead for a word of prayer dear Lord Jesus Heavenly Father we just ask that Lord you'll just come and break the bread of life with us Lord that you'll cleanse our hearts of our sins and our unbelief Lord and our iniquities that you'll just wash us in your blood and Lord that you'll just come and father that you'll just speak to us that you'll just give us encouraging words in this hour Lord we love you we thank you Lord we commit everything in your hands for your honor and your glory in Jesus Christ's name we ask it amen amen you may be seated praise the Lord amen so I'd like to talk to you for a little while I guess and I like to talk to you about in his time amen uh the other day I was I got listening to a series of messages that brother brandham preached back in January of 1955 and I found them pretty outstanding so I want to read some of the quotes out of there but we noticed that in the opening scripture it said that for everything there is a season and for everything there is a Time Amen brother brandom said so the main thing is if we can find where God's word belongs in our life God sets times and time limits and then it works all to that time many of them before the coming of the Lord Jesus there was many false things raised up and said this is the Messiah and this is and there was many false things taking place according to the scriptures just before the coming of the Lord Jesus so we know we're we're in the season we're in the time you know we've gotten now to 2024 which is quite amazing I mean it's really quite amazing when I I found the Lord because he always knew where I was I just didn't know where he was but when I found the Lord in 76 I thought oh my he's coming tomorrow and there was many things that uh Donna and I we we were living together we had to get things straightened up because God was coming and so you know we straightened up we got married and then and then we got baptized right away and then I said well I want the Holy Ghost right now and I mean that's a good thing to want but God has a time in a season for that and so there was things that had to be straightened up and things you know you have to learn how to repent and then you have to learn how to get a hold of God and then God finally comes you know his promises yay and amen he's not going to fail he's going to give the Holy Ghost to them who seek after him amen so brother brandham here you'll notice that in the scriptures that we read we said there Solomon was writing the Book of Ecclesiastes he said there is a season and a time for everything and of course we thought that God was you know that the holy ghost that that Jesus was coming back right then and and we made prepar preparations for that but I want you to notice that brother brandham says the main thing the very first thing you got to do is you've got to find out where God's word belongs in your life that's the very first lesson that a Christian needs to learn is that God is in control of all of this and that God's word is the guidepost it's the compass that you need if you're going to succeed in this hour amen because this is a perilous time but it's also a glorious time amen so sometimes we have to be reminded of these things so brother brandom notice here in this in this quote he says God sets times and time limits and then he works all of that according to his time and right away he goes back and says when Jesus came came the first time there was all kinds of false things that rose up he talks about the time of Jesus coming now and right away puts a warning in there that there's all kinds of Trials and troubles and things false things it'll raise up and you say they'll call it this is the Messiah and this is that and many false things taken place according to the scriptures just before the coming of the Lord Jesus and people try to do it within themselves they try to make God's word fit in their program but you got it vice versa you've got to fit in God's program and that's what we find out that that's true amen amen so we get down now you know we're in 2024 now and we've seen a lot of things we thought you know in 2000 we thought well God's coming we thought in well I thought in 1980 God was coming because they had all the planets lining up on one side of the Earth and the Earth was going to completely explode but it didn't happen and then we thought other times that God was coming we thought you know you you think oh but see God has a time and God has a season and when things don't just work out the way you think they should work out then you need to make sure that you can find where the word of God is settled in your life because that is the Tie poost amen and Christ is identified the same in all generations this 1964 brother brandom says many times we get nervous and we begin to think well it ought to be this way and we've got to make it this way or make it that way or we we we he says we don't have anything to do with it just play out your part that he leads us to play amen and remember there's nothing out of cater the great omnipotent God knows just exactly before the foundation of the world that we would sit here tonight and people don't really think about that see but if the word of God is something that you meditate on day and night or at least think about it at least once a day that God knows everything and because of for knowledge he can predestinate and he already knows exactly what's going to happen tomorrow he knows everything amen and we think well it ought to be like this or we ought to make it this way or we ought to do that way he says you don't have anything to do with it you know Jesus the disciples they all they were all upset and nervous and everything else said which one of you by taking thought can make yourself taller right which one of you by taking thought can make yourself thinner heal yourself you know when you're sick you go oh I know God's A Healer and you go in to pray and you pray and you pray and you pray and and and then the doubts all come so you have to know that the word of God is true regardless of the outcome regardless of what happens you've got to know that the word of God is true amen amen the great omnipotent God knows just exactly before the foundation of the world that we would sit here tonight if he's infinite he has to know that so he can't be infinite without knowing all things and by his foreign knowledge he knew that this meeting would be here and perhaps ordained of him I trust that it is to bring some more into the kingdom amen so I want to go over here to 2 Thessalonians and there's just a couple of scriptures that I really want to zero in but as I was looking at it I thought wow you're really not going to see this unless we read the the whole first chapter so this is 2 Thessalonians chapter 1 starting at verse one it says Paul and salanus and timotheus under the Church of the Thessalonians in God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ Grace unto you and peace I like that let's relax I know it's tax time but let's just relax from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ we are bound to thank God always for you Brethren as it is meat because that your faith groweth exceedingly you know if your faith is growing at all it's a great thing Faith growing is something that you don't really know about you really don't know I mean Faith just happens and then one day you're you're in you know Faith can't even be proven without a trial that's right you can say well I have all kinds of Faith but unless you have it tried you just have a bunch of words but Paul writing to the Thessalonians he said he already he said your faith is growing and the charity of every one of you all toward each other aboundeth isn't that wonderful amen so that we ourselves glory in you in the Churches of God for your patience and faith and all of your persecutions and tribulations that you endure amen amen now if you were to ask me people aren't throwing Tomatoes at my house when I go out and I go to the supermarket I'm not getting followed around with a bunch of people with pitchforks trying to kill me so I don't understand about persecutions and tribulations like Paul was talking to the Thessalonian church we live in a different age in a different time God has a season for everything okay he says here he says which is a manifest token of the righteous Judgment of God that you may be counted worthy of the kingdom of God for which you also suffer amen so whenever there's anything that pressure comes in your life it is an it's a manifest token of God's love that you're in the Kingdom it's not that he cursed you he's blessing you he's trying to show you that you are everything's going to be all right if if you trust in the Lord with all your might he will direct your path if you trust in the Lord in your darkest hour he will take care of it he will take care of it and it's a manifest token amen verse six says seeing it is a righteous thing with God to recompense tribulations to them that trouble you oh that's that's a comforting thought but I might thinking I'd like to have that happen now man maybe I don't like my boss maybe I don't like the guy that's working next to me maybe I don't like my neighbor and I'd love God to recompense because the scripture says so but you didn't read all the scriptures because I want you to that's why I said I get you got to read all of this to get to where I want to go seeing it is a righteous thing with God to recompense tribulation to them that trouble you and to you who are troubled rest rest rest when the Lord Jesus shall be revealed from heaven with his mighty Angels you have to be patient and look at how he's he Paul when he's writing this he tells them this is when he's going to recompense is when he comes back when he's revealed from heaven with Mighty Angels INF flaming fire taking Vengeance on them that know not God and that obey not the gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ who shall be punished with Everlasting destruction from the presence of the Lord and from the glory of his power that is not in this lifetime friends that's at his coming so you may have an awful boss you may have an awful boss for a year you may have an awful boss for a couple years you have a may have a neighbor that every time that you go out in your yard he spits on you you but God is Not giv you a promise what did Paul say as we have therefore opportunity let us do good unto all men and then especially unto the house of household of faith we need to live peaceably amen because verse 10 says why why was Paul saying this he says when he shall come to be glorified in his Saints and to be admired in all them that believe because our testimony among you was believed in that day God has one purpose for giving you the Holy Ghost you might think it's for raising the dead and for you answering your prayers and Healing The Sick and everything else but God's got one purpose purpose I got a quote the other day and I was reading it and then I got to thinking about it brother Brandon made this statement he said he said Jesus would not let the disciples go out and preach until they were endured with and power from on high on the day of Pentecost well I went back and I looked and Jesus when he called the 12 disciples he gave them power over all kinds of devils and demons and he told them preach and I went wait a minute he told them to preach he told them to go out and say that the kingdom of heaven was at hand amen and they went and did all those things so much so that they came back rejoicing but yet there was something that they did not have that Pentecost required amen so so you thinking that wow if I could get the Holy Ghost then I could have all the signs of Mark 16 well that would be wonderful because I'd like to have all the signs of Mark 16 that would be great but Paul said the greater thing what he was telling the the Thessalonian Church the greater thing is that the word The Life of Christ the character of Christ would be magnified in you amen amen because the disciples were still the disciples Peter even though he had all those signs and all those things he could do he still didn't have control over his temper he still didn't have the the goods on the inside that could keep him from shooting his mouth off right but after Pentecost his whole he became Fearless you see Paul rending to the Thessalonians he says wherefore also we pray see we pray always for you that our God would count you worthy of this calling what calling not just the calling of having gifts and the supernatural in your life but that you can live the life of Christ what Jesus Jesus was a little bit disappointed when he walked on the earth as a man he was only one he could only go so far he could only do so much but on the day of Pentecost there was 5,000 jesuses now there was 5,000 Jesus and they could go places and when the persecution came in the in the book of Acts the fire was in them and the Flames got really brushed and Scattered them all around and what were they doing the Jesus that they were trying to to get rid of they were just scattering in other places and everyone that got filled with the Holy Ghost wasn't just so much to do Miracles and sign and wonders but to live like Jesus Christ amen in different places all around the world Amen praise the Lord count you worthy of this calling and fulfill all the good pleasure of his good and the work of Faith with power that the name of our Lord Jesus Christ might be glorified in you and you in him according to the grace of our God and the Lord Jesus Christ amen amen praise the Lord so now we're in 2024 I mean sorry we're here we'd like to see God come we'd like to see Jesus Christ come we'd like to we'd like to see the resurrection we would like to see a lot of things but God has set a time and a season as a place and now we have to learn to be mature we have to be mature enough to wait for his time his season his place amen amen praise the Lord God's got a time for all things he's got a time now we plant corn we got a time that we plow corn right now the weather's a little bit screwed up this is still February don't go out and plant your garden you're going to be in trouble snow's coming back we plant corn we got a time that we plow corn then at the time we harvest corn the spring rains come the draw it through the summer the rain falls the Snows you just can't say I plant my wheat today and tomorrow and I go out and harvest it God has times for Seasons he has seasons for his word he has times when the scripture here he said and the presence of the Lord was there to heal the sick that's when Jesus was ministering too at the presence of the Lord was there to heal the sick maybe at other times the presence of the Lord wasn't there to heal the sick we find out that God works everything seasonally amen so brother Brenham goes on he says so now we see as Full Gospel people I think we've made many mistakes looking into the word and saying God said this and I'm guilty just as anybody else I look in the Bible and I go but the word says this well you can't make the situation match the word you have to let the word right you have to let the word of God Be Your guide you're going to you you'll see he says so brother random said he said so I think I think we many times make the mistake by looking into the word and say God said this and we failed to find the direct revelation of our life to fit in that program so the first thing we have to find the word and get it in the right place in our life then we have to start following it and as we start following it then we have to have God reveal to us what the purpose he has for us and for our family and for where we live and for where we work and for everything that we do God has a purpose God has a plan amen amen so now you're happy right veryy amen okay so we take a couple examples um we we going to talk about Noah so the time came when time for God to destroy the world with water right now we are in the the preus we want to see the world we know that this is the hour when God's going to destroy the world by fire right we know that we know we're in the time the season of the rapture we know that we know we are in the season of the body change we know that but now we got to wait for God's time we're not going to be able to fast our way into it we're not going to be able to pray our way into it the other night we were watching the news and uh this big time preacher over in Africa they just arrested him because he had a compound and he was he had a lot of followers a lot of Believers and they were coming and they found out that these people got in this cult and when it the newsman was telling this the story I told Don I says I want to hear what scripture this guy's got for this this pre this preacher was preaching to them how many would like to see Jesus okay I'm yes how many like to see Jesus right Away Great I got a away just come on down join up in our camp he took him in there put him in the he says I guarantee within two weeks you can see Jesus Christ face to face he starved him to death they had Mass Graves where they put little kids in the K that no water you know how fast you die without any water no water no food this poor man was talking about his eight children and his wife they he came home from work one day and they were gone just a letter there and he went and tried to find them and ended up they all died I think three of them he got three of his kids back you see we're in the season for that we're in the season when we want to see God and but if you don't have the word of God you don't have it as your your as the center of your life you've missed it you you you missed something if it's not the center of your life you missed something I mean I can tell you in 76 when I got saved I I had just flunked out of college flunked out flamed out big time I was 19 I didn't know where I was going I didn't know anything about this world the world is a scary place for a 19-year-old now I you know don't go home make your parents mad where you going to live right and I went out I I I met Donna and and then I wasn't I wasn't think I wasn't even thinking about God and the first job I got I I got introduced to the religious nut of the company they said watch out for this guy he's a nut and I I says okay the very first launch we sat down and we started talking and he said do you know well there's other parts of my testimony but I'm not going to go into it but he started asking me he says do you know that God was going to send us a prophet in the last days and I said yes I did and I knew because I had memorized Malachi 4 when I was in uh fifth grade W in the Presbyterian Church wow yeah that's a wow to me that's a big deal then God because I found him because I found the pearl of great price because I put the word in the center of my life amen a guy with no degrees no education ended up becoming an IT manager how's that even possible found favor with people around me found God did everything and now I'm retired and I don't even know how it [Laughter] happened I don't even know how I mean the Lord has taking care of us we have plenty of food we have money we have we have a house it's paid for we have all these things because we found the word and then we put the word first and then whatever took place we always looked in the word and say okay what do we do now and we followed the Lord amen amen you forgot what the name of the subject is in his time amen so there came a time for God to destroy the world with water and he sent a man by the name of Noah and God got the world ready for judgment and he taken the time came for Noah to go into the ark so let's look at Genesis 6 praise the Lord amen amen you say oh but Brother Bruce we already know these stories no open up your Bible go to Genesis 6 and then underline it amen so that when you forgot about me you can open up the Bible one day and go oh I got this highlighted verse five says and God saw that the wickedness of man was great on the earth and that every imagination of the thoughts of his heart was only evil continually and it repented the Lord that he had made man on the Earth and grieved him at his heart and the Lord said I will destroy man who I have created from the face of the Earth both man and Beast and the creeping thing and the fowls of the air for it repenteth me that I have made them but Noah found Grace in the eyes of the Lord you know what that means brother Jonathan there's a chance for you and me that's right brother Dennis there's a chance for you and me because when we read about Noah we think of Noah as being a righteous man but none of us would stand up and admit that we were righteous right that's right because we all see our failures amen amen now brother Bron makes this point he says look Noah could not go into the ark before God was ready for him to go settle that in your heart I am here till the either the grave takes me or the Rapture comes and I'm going to serve the Lord no matter how many blown things they put on Facebook or whatever they want to do is fine with me my mind's already made up I've already seen the evidence of this and I know that it works and I know that God is not a liar so what that puts me in a in a precarious place so to speak because what are you going to do when things don't go well I'm just going to keep moving moving ahead that's what I'm going to do I'm going to keep I'm I'm just getting ready just going to keep going Noah could not go in the ark before it was time for him to go but when the season came for Noah to go into the ark God shut the door behind him Noah is that right all the opportunities for anyone else to ever enter it was gone because that God had closed the door so now notice when the time came for Noah to go into the ark the door closed and they could not close they couldn't even close until that time you imagine how many times Noah got frustrated with the people he was talking to come out there the next day I'm going to work on the ark today and somebody just stole my tools again or maybe the supply chain didn't Supply the gopherwood or he ordered so many gallons of tar and and pitch and only half of it showed up you don't believe me but okay let's go to First Peter 3 let's take a look at First Peter 3 then we'll go back there that's why the word of God has got to be your centerp it's got to be you can't you can't put it on brother John you can't put it on me don't follow me I'm a mess and I'm big enough to tell you that you don't have to say Amen First Peter 1 okay First Peter chapter 3: 18 for Christ also hath once suffered for sins the just for the unjust aren't you glad for that we are unjust but he Di died for us thank you Lord that he might bring us to God being put to death in the flesh but quickened by the spirit see so without the Holy Ghost by which also he went and preached under the spirits in prison which sometime were disobedient when Once the longsuffering of God waited in the days of Noah 120 years years he waited Noah didn't wait God waited cuz God had a set time when he was going to shut the door and God's longsuffering think how patient he is with us right because we pray and then we don't get the answer we want and we kind of Stomp our feet and we walk out and and God knows that and I appreciate that he knows that I'm flesh and he knows that I'm a mess and that I'm depending on a sacrifice that he provided and that's good enough for him it's good enough for me amen cuz he says God waited in the days of Noah while the ark was in a preparing wherein few that is eight Souls were saved by water in sup brother said so when God raised up Noah it was a sign that that intellectual age had come to its end why because he was fulfilling what Paul said there in 2 Thessalonians Noah was God's word in the flesh manifested walking talking pleading just trying to be a friend to to the unlovable doing he was he was Christ manifested in the flesh standing before his neighbors living that life amen amen it was a sign that that intellectual age had come to its end and Noah preached the judgments of God coming and he was rejected and laughed at and made fun of but Noah went into the ark and God condemned those who left at him Noah was a sign of the uncoming Judgment God's sign to the Earth and if you think about just that little paragraph that little quote that is exactly what we read in 2 Thessalonians chapter 1 it is a manifest token of his love towards Noah even though Noah lived out verse 10 through verse2 he lived out Christ but yet God then destroyed DED everybody that didn't listen to Noah amen Noah didn't destroy them Noah didn't take Vengeance on them that's a big problem that we have you know we have tempers we have sometimes we just you know and we lose it we don't want to admit that but we get upset but it takes the Holy Ghost it takes an extra measure of Grace say Lord please if you could if he already demonstrated it for us he showed us Amen in Genesis 7 verse1 it says and the Lord said unto Noah Come Thou and all the house into the ark for thee have I seen righteous before me and this generation and when God shut the door Noah couldn't open it God closed the door amen let's take a look at at Moses so in order to see Moses you have to go to Genesis 15 and Genesis 15 is a great prophecy about Moses but God never told Abraham he was going to do it with a Moses and in verse 13 it says and he said unto Abraham know of assurity that thy seed shall be a stranger in a land that is not theirs and Shall Serve them and they shall afflict them 400 years now how would you like to have that for a prophecy right brother Jonathan guess what you're going to lose your job you're going to lose everything I'm going to take it all away you're going to suffer and then one day I'm going to lift you up are you ready nope Abraham never comprehended what God said to him God just told it to him and also that Nation whom they Shall Serve will I judge and afterward shall they come out with great substance and thou shalt go to thy fathers in peace and thou shall be buried in a good old age that's the part about Moses then the rest is about Abram brother brandham said he said so he says it the time it came time one time for the children of Israel to be delivered from the Egyptian bondage was which is exactly what he's talking about here let's go to Exodus 1 because I want to read this and then read you this quote I hope you have not fallen [Music] asleep because you should be hearing the still Small Voice in the background Crown if not I'll yell at you after a little bit in verse 7 of Exodus 1 it says and the children of Israel were fruitful and increased abundantly and multiplied and waxed exceedingly mightily and the land was filled with them it was a time of great blessings it was wonderful incomes was up they had nice houses they had kids they had grandkids they had Aunts Uncles life was good it's kind of like in the 60s it was good and then there arose up a new king over Egypt which knew not Joseph when the time of the promise Drew nigh there raised up a pharaoh who did not know Joseph why the season was there they respected Israel up to that time they respected the Israelites they respected them but God's time piece said it's time it's time and watch what God did you're still in Exodus right verse 9 and he said unto the people beh behold the people of the children of Israel are more and mightier than we so first of all he recognized he had a problem come on let us deal wisely with them lest they multiply and it come to pass that when they fall out fall without out any War they join also unto our enemies wisely that word's interpreted wrong let us deal deceitful with them right yeah let's let's we got to be careful because these Jews they could join with our enemies and fight against us and so get them up out of the land we need to get them out therefore did it Ser over them task Masters to afflict them with their burdens than anybody go back and read Genesis no these people came home and they were frustrated because now gas was going up now things were not quite the things were not quite the way they were when they started on this journey but God was fulfilling his word amen to afflict them and they built for Pharaoh treasured cities Fifth and ramsy you know King Tut you've probably seen that in the history books that's all the Jews work it is you can prove it in history and they were grieved because of the but the more they Afflicted them the more they multiplied and the more they grew but you see we're not in that hour I I don't know if you know that we're not in that hour We're in the top of the pyramid and when you're in the top of the pyramid the group gets less and less and less not more and more and more so there's going to be less and less Believers as we get closer and closer to the coming of the Lord amen but they they grew more and more they multiplied they grew and they were grieved because of the children of Israel and the Egyptians made the children of Israel to serve with rigor amen amen and then it says and they made their lives bitter with hard bondage in Mortar brick all manner of service in the field all their service wherein they made them serve was with rigor amen and what was it what was God doing brother Bram said but the season was there for no more respect that God could shower down his judgment upon the Egyptians he could not judge the Egyptians without them losing respect for the Believers amen chapter 2 it all changes with the birth of Moses Moses comes on the scene and Moses he was he was thinking Moses if you if you study it and and we don't have time but Moses had a supernatural birth he was he was born at the wrong time they were murdering all the male children his parents didn't obey their federal law they hid the child for three months till he got too big he started making too much noise they prayed God said put him in a basket take him down and put him in the Nile River and they protested they said you know the Lord don't you know there's alligators down there why would I give this nice smelling young boy to the alligators for lunch but God had a plan God took him down let took him right to Pharaoh's it's great it's a it's beautiful he goes right down to Pharaoh's uh daughter's feet and she says it's a Hebrew why don't you just drown it then but she didn't because God's season and time and he watches over not the he watches over his word so because Moses was a fulfillment of the word God wasn't so much concerned about the vessel but the promise that laid in the vessel The Vessel you see you're just the vessel of God so that God can manifest his word he wants to manifest his word and if he destroys the vessel how's he going to do that so then he'll watch over you amen praise the Lord amen amen amen so Moses went out and he killed the Egyptian we know the story he killed the Egyptian but one little detail that I had failed to miss in 30 years or whatever of serving the lord I want you to look at verse 21 verse 21 of chapter 2 says and Moses was content to dwell with the man and he gave Moses Zora his daughter Moses was content once he once he fled out into the Wilderness and he fled from Pharaoh he was good to get away from he was good to get away from God he was good to get away from the promise he was good he was good and he was content the priest of Midian he says yeah he says this is a good life for me I can have a child here the Egyptians are way far away children of Israel they don't believe me they don't want me as their deliverer and here I am I I just I'm good in the believer's position in Christ brother brandham says so now Moses when he was here knowing that God had made a promise that he was going to deliver the children of Israel why Moses knowing that he was called for that purpose now when you have a call from God that doesn't mean altogether that you can just jump right out and you're going to do the will of God you have to find the will of God and the time time of God to do it Moses thought well the children of Israel will certainly understand now that I'm to be their deliverer so he starts out to be so he kills a man he find out that the children of Israel did not understand then Moses lost all the hopes and all the power that he had why because his faith was shaken and when you when you when you get rid of your faith you lose your power cuz you can't make the word live God makes the word live and that gives you faith and when you deny God living in you then you have no power right long as Samson let his hair grow out because that was the word he was good but when he F when he said yeah go ahead cut him off and he thought he said when he when he rose up he said oh I think I think I'll shake myself like I did in time past and he knew not that he was faithless and that he had lost all his power Moses lost all the hope all the power that he had thinking that freedom wasn't even for the children of Israel the whole promise is a lie in the last days the scripture says that people Believers will say where's the promise of his coming right you see you got to rest you got to find where the word applies to you you got to put it in the center of your life you got to stay I mean you can you can do what you want brother John tells you all the time you're a free moral agent right right but choose the word you'll be all right Amen brother brandom in another message called gifts he says then he did not do nothing within himself no Prophet ever did anything within himself until first God showed what to do what a mistake Moses made when he went out without the vision of God and smokee that Egyptian thought he'd liberate them with his hands because he thought he had a lot of faith and that he could do it because he was called to do the job no matter how much you're called for the job God has to do the leading you see he failed of all of his schooling and his military mind and his training as a great Egyptian leader yet it failed because God had a program and we've got to work according to God's program no matter what we do how smart we are we've got to Humble ourselves and work according to God's program amen so he failed and God had to keep him another 40 years to educate him you know what he was educating him it wasn't so much that he had to forget everything that he learned from the Egyptians but he had to learn to trust God that's the only lesson he had to learn the only lesson you have to learn is to trust God God you already know math you know science you know how to read you know how to write you don't have to learn all of that to get rid of all that to become a Christian right to become a Christian you got to learn to trust God Amen and Trust his word and stay with his word when things go wrong and look for his promise amen because his promise is yay and amen amen amen see so we failed God had to keep him another 40 years to educate him so what it was he must forget himself and it's not him but it's God the promise to Abraham wasn't that I've got this man and he's going to come and deliver you that isn't what the prophecy said the prophecy said I will bring them out with a mighty hand amen I'm going to do the work because I'm the one who's sending him down there you think about how when everything when the promise of God which was a blessing it wasn't a blessing to Joseph see now I'm in trouble cuz I'm starting to preach and we're out of time Joseph Joseph was 17 year olds he couldn't it was not his fault that he had the dream his fault was that he testified about the dream he probably shouldn't have shared it with anybody he shared it with his brothers and made his brothers mad then he had another dream so he shared it with his dad and they got mad right and then when he went down his brother said oh here comes the dreamer they weren't complaining about the coat and everything else the dreamer here comes the dreamer let's kick him out of here and see how his dreams work out now God was taking him right where he needed to be taking him every and you know when he went to Piper's house you know people think they they they got the wrong idea I'm going to give you some advice brother Jonathan don't make yourself weird don't don't put yourself out there like some kind of a nut God wants you to be Jesus Christ that's what he wants you to be be loving kind be a help to The Sinner do something for somebody don't be crazy that's right because Joseph went down to Piper's house and he became the vice president of the company he did and it wasn't that Joseph was the problem Piper's wife was the problem because God said okay we got him now I'm going to take him down I'm the Potter he's the clay I'm going to Mar him down here a little bit work on him a little bit more he took him down and put him in the prison that's a bad place right he not a bad place but you know what he come the head chef he became the guy that gave everybody else to food and he still had dreams he still had interpreting of Dreams you see you're looking at all the circumstances and everything you're looking at all wrong we know that we're in 2024 I don't really care because I'm looking at the word of God we know that everything is kind of a mess we know that let me read those last couple quotes and then and you know I'm not going to do those 75 scriptures I got afterwards hey had lost all thoughts of Freedom till God met him one day in a burning bush and then when God season came along just exactly then he revealed his plan to Moses so when God killed the Egyptian it wasn't God's season when he went out into the desert it wasn't God's season but God had to train Moses he had to teach Moses to trust him trust the word trust me trust me I will take care of you oh but I can't I just don't you know that's a thing it's a funny thing right I'm going to say this once and then probably never say it again but you know that's a thing with ties ties is an act of worship it's not an act of giving it's just it's not it's not an act of you doing anything it's an act of worship right and if you don't have faith to worship then don't don't do it don't do it to say God give increase my faith and let let God prove that he can keep his word amen am amen now the reason Moses had forgotten about Freedom God's promise that he would free them but God had not forgot his promise Moses tried in himself and failed and that's what the church has done many times we've tried in ourselves to do things and when we fail to find God's element of time God's got a time for all things amen so what season do we live in well according to Luke 17 as it was in the days of Noah okay so we know in the days of Noah it was a time of prosperity but we also know that it was every imagination on the man was wickedness and evil and everything else so quit complaining about it the scriptures are being fulfilled right as it was in the days of Noah so there also in Luke 21 it says earthquakes in diverse places and the Sea roaring we just see California this La this past week California got half a year worth of rain in one day half a year worth the rain in one day you g to stop that well I mean I I agree I believe global warming is true I I don't think it's fake carbon emissions is a bad thing yep but you going to stop that we turn on all the cars to electric and we're still not going to stop that because we've given up on God we've turned our back on God and what are we we are Noah right amen we are we have found Grace in his sight and all God wants us to do is second in Thessalonians 1 Let Jesus Christ live in you amen earthquakes in diverse places the sea roaring Ezekiel 7:19 says it'll come a time when they'll cast their silver into the streets and their gold will not save them yeah so if my 41 K goes oh well right but I don't know because the scripture said you know when that happens I should be saying praise the Lord God's word it's another piece it's another element it's another brick in the place because every time he does fulfill something we're getting closer to his coming that's right amen Daniel 12 1-4 says that in the last days they'll run to and fro and knowledge shall increase we're there praise the Lord praise the Lord when we sing glory to his name we should think about the things that God's fulfilling around us amen amen and then we all know 2 Timothy 3 1-5 where it says in the last day perilous times will come and men will be lovers of their themselves and they'll be transvestites and they'll be gay marriage and even the pope now is thinking that maybe he should soften his stance on gay marriage and why there's nothing you can do about it because it's the word of God being fulfilled I'm not I'm not okay good I'm happy for you Romans 4 tells me I believe it's Romans 4 tells me it says when they knew God they didn't want to know him and he turned them over to a reprobate mind that they'd do ungodly things amongst themselves and everything else it's right there in the Bible you don't want you going to rip that page out fine I choose not to amen am Revelations 3:10 says that there will come a time on the pace of the Earth when the Temptation will come that will try the whole world now I know everybody listens to the news and we all think the economy here is bad but you don't have to open your eyes very much to find out that the economy is bad worldwide it's not not here our economy is actually doing pretty good when I look at places that got 200% inflation I'm thankful for whatever I'm paying for a loaf of bread really and Argentina I I read where Argentina right after World War II was one the almost the richest nation in South America because of beef sales they got 200% inflation there right now and the guy that just took over as president in that country he wants to completely get rid of their uh whatever their their uh currency is and they want to use US dollars but the government is so crooked that the government won't let him do it and the other thing that you had to notice I mean I like it a lot to say but I'm not going to say it and then Revelations 13 you forgot to look at Revelations 13 you should probably read Revelations 13 once a month because the Bible says that in the last days the Beast will give the power to the image of the Beast to speak as and he will he'll come after the Saints and he's going to go part of the economy he's going to have everything in his hands praise the Lord God said he'd take care of me and that's what I'm concerned about oh that looks like it's all really really bad but if you give me another five minutes I hope I help you so in Luke 22:32 let's put that one up there we'll do the last couple here what's that say fear not fear not little flock for it is your father's good pleasure to give you the kingdom amen amen right okay Zechariah 14 verse 6 uh oh did I forget to put that on there well I'll sing it for you it shall be light about the evening time the path to Glory you will surely find Amen in the Waterway is the truth today baptized in the precious name of Jesus Christ young and old repent of all your sins the Holy Ghost will surely enter in the evening light has come it's a fact that God and Christ are one it shall come to pass in that day that the light shall not be clear nor dark but yeah things that were true for years are no longer true what's the next verse say who art th oh great M he shall bring forth well here we go see crying Grace who art thou oh great Mountain before his rebble thou sh become a plane and he shall bring forth The Headstone thereof with shoutings crying Grace Grace unto it you know what the headstone is we're part of that Noah found Grace in the eyes of the Lord amen amen praise the Lord that's a promise for us not to be worried about the economy or what the gays and the lesbians are doing they're okay leave them alone amen Malachi 4 told me behold I I God himself shall send you Jonathan thank you he sent you Elijah the prophet thank you Lord he sent me Elijah the prophet so if you don't want him I'm good with that he's he's my Prophet I'm keeping him amen amen Daniel 11:32 I like this one this is another good one and such it do wickedly against the Covenant shall be corrupted by flatteries well we're doing that now but the people that do know their God shall be strong and do exploits praise the Lord and the first exploit that they're going to do is they're going to live like Christians amen that's what they're going to do amen and then I'm just close with Philippians 2:15 and you can forget about everything else that I said that you may be blameless and harmless the son Son of God without rebuke in the midst of a crooked and perverse Nation so why are you praying for the nation to no longer be perverse then you're breaking the scriptures somebody's got to be here to be that amen how many I mean I'm a Son of God I don't care if you put your hand up or not don't matter to me that I could be blameless and Har less the sons of God without rebuke in the midst of a crooked and perverse Nation among whom me that's Bruce shine as a light in this world praise the Lord amen not in the wilderness you know yeah not no no no God Want Jesus Christ was born to serve right he was born a light to the world and because people love Darkness more than light they rejected him but it didn't stop him he didn't go off and cry and say Lord I I always I was listening to a tape a while back and it it's this is just really stuck with me he says you know the man that created artificial teeth he said he made himself a reputation he said a guy that created artificial arm made himself of a reputation the doctor that operated on my heart is one of the best in the nation God's fantastic he made himself a reputation but he said the god that created the heart when he came made himself of no reputation the god that created the arm made himself of no reputation let us be that let us not be seeking vain Glory let us not be seeking reputation and what we can do but let us be Jesus Christ make me Jesus Christ to this world Amen Let Me Be that one I mean I think about it I I there's I gotta be quiet but Don and I we were watching a a movie and this Jewish rabbi in there he was talking to this guy he said there was a man there was a man that that he he got up one day and he he got done saying his prayers at the synagogue and he went out and he said he found out that somebody this he he read an article this guy needed a kidney so we went to the doctor and he had the blood test and go he found out hey my kidney I could help this guy so he signed up had his kidney taken out gave it to this guy and he felt pretty good for a couple of days then he found out there with somebody else then they needed a liver and he said oh I can't live without a liver but they found somebody who could use some blood so he started gave he gave blood then he found his people were hungry so he took everything from his grocery store and he went down and he gave it to the homeless shelter and everything else well then it got so burdensome in him that he finally went down to the registry and he he donated all of his all of his organs and then he went home and he got in his bathtub and he slid his wrists and called 911 I thought wow and sometimes that's how we are we can't help everyone but we can pray for everyone Jesus said not everybody can go to the mission field but he says pray to the Lord of the Harvest that he'll send someone that he'll send someone that knows their language someone that knows their custom someone right now there is someone in Russia going and testifying to somebody I believe it amen there's somebody in India Pakistan it's all the countries of the world it's it's a big mess you don't even have to look very much but it's all signs that his time it's getting close but it'll be in his time don't don't try to get ahead of him and try to make yourself in just don't even do it because it would just be a failure praise the Lord let's all Stand Together dear Lord Jesus Heavenly Father we are grateful Lord that you chose us Lord when your Prophet was here he told that little story he said oh if the Holy Ghost came to me and said Billy Billy brandom if you could pick an a age what age would you want to be in would you want to be in Paul's age would you want to be in the the ox age would you want to be in the man's age finny and Knox and Luther and Wesley would you like to be in those what age would you be in he says oh let me be in the last age but you know that's the age when you're neither hot nor cold that's the age when everything's Fallen apart but Billy brandham said that's the age he's coming back that's the age he's not looking at all the things forgive us for looking at all the troubles that are coming on the face of the Earth we don't mean to do that let us look at the positive things that are in the word of God you're just fulfilling your word we're so thankful Lord that you chose us and Lord Jesus you keep us and you can lift us up you can use us and I pray that you will use every everyone use every one of us Lord in the field in the
