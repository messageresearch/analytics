[32:48] more real inside of us, Lord, when we
[32:51] leave the building today. God, we commit
[32:54] the service in your hands and all that
[32:56] you do. We give you glory and honor now
[32:58] in advance for these things. For we pray
[33:01] in Jesus Christ's name. Amen. Amen. God
[33:04] bless you today. Turn with if you would
[33:06] to the book of Psalms, chapter 34. We're
[33:10] just going to read one verse there and
[33:11] have you be seated. Good to have brother
[33:14] Ron uh back helping out. Um uh brother,
[33:20] uh Bruce, brother Bruce just does an
[33:23] amazing job and we just really
[33:25] appreciate him.
[33:28] I know that he would like um a break and
[33:31] and and the encouragement of brother
[33:34] Ron. So, we appreciate Brother Ron and
[33:37] appreciate him uh being back with us.
[33:39] And it's also good to have brother
[33:41] Marty. Amen. Amen. We we've missed them
[33:45] and
[33:47] um and we just pray that God
[33:50] would be real good to both of them.
[33:54] Amen. Amen. Psalms chapter 34 and we're
[33:59] just going to read one verse there and
[34:01] have you be seated. Verse number eight
[34:05] of Psalms 34. Oh, taste and see that the
[34:09] Lord is good. Blessed is the man that
[34:13] trusteth in him. Amen. Amen. God bless
[34:16] you. May be seated. I want to just go up
[34:19] a couple verses there if I could.
[34:23] Starting with verse number five. They
[34:27] looked unto him and were
[34:31] lightened and their faces were not
[34:35] ashamed. This poor man
[34:39] um this poor man cried and the Lord
[34:42] heard him and saved him out of all his
[34:46] troubles. How many's ever been wanted to
[34:48] be saved out of their situation? Amen.
[34:51] All right. The scripture says, "This
[34:52] poor man cried and the Lord heard him
[34:55] and he saved him all out of all his
[34:57] troubles." Verse 7, "The angel of the
[35:00] Lord is encamped round about them that
[35:02] fear him and deliverth him." So the
[35:04] angel of the Lord is not encamped around
[35:07] the proud, around the arrogant, around
[35:11] those that think I I've got things
[35:13] handled. I'm going to do things my way.
[35:15] the L, the angel of the Lord is not
[35:17] encamped about them, but he is encamped
[35:19] around them that fear him. And and and
[35:22] so we see from these two scriptures, a
[35:25] poor man crying, the Lord saving him and
[35:27] and the angel being around them that
[35:28] fear him, that there is a group of
[35:30] people who who God blesses and and the
[35:34] scripture comes forth and says, "Oh,
[35:37] taste and see that the Lord is good."
[35:39] Amen. Blessed is the man that trusteth
[35:41] in him. Amen.
[35:46] When a person has never eaten something
[35:52] uh before, there could be a
[35:57] hesitation. I don't
[36:00] know. I don't
[36:02] [Music]
[36:04] know. But if somebody says to you, hey,
[36:07] you got to try this dish. It is really
[36:10] good. Right. Well, then you have this
[36:14] expectation that when I taste it,
[36:19] I'm I'm willing to taste it and see if
[36:21] it's good, right? Amen. And uh usually
[36:24] if somebody says, "You got to taste this
[36:25] is really good." You know, it's probably
[36:27] pretty good. We Well, I got different
[36:29] pallets and taste buds and things like
[36:31] that. But when somebody is jumping at
[36:33] the gun how good something is, you you
[36:36] you you're more willing to taste it and
[36:38] see if it really is good. Right? But if
[36:41] it's somebody, you know, you you you you
[36:43] you could have a a a
[36:46] a thought of, well, you know, I I just I
[36:49] don't want to do it. But if somebody
[36:50] tells you this is a great dish, you've
[36:52] got to taste it. It's amazing. Then
[36:55] you're more apt to taste it. And the
[36:57] scripture is saying we need to taste and
[36:59] see if the Lord is good. Right
[37:03] now, the way we individually taste the
[37:06] Lord is by personally putting our trust
[37:09] in God's word. Right?
[37:13] That's how you taste to see if the Lord
[37:16] is good is when you personally, not your
[37:19] husband, not your wife, not your
[37:21] children, not your mom and dad, but you
[37:24] you
[37:25] you personally put your trust in. That's
[37:27] you individually tasting
[37:30] that the Lord is good. And it's through
[37:32] this process of trust that we learn to
[37:35] lean upon God because it's not easy.
[37:38] It's not just I'm going to go to the
[37:39] bank. You can't go to the bank and
[37:42] withdraw $5,000 if you only got a
[37:44] thousand in there. Right.
[37:48] So when you when you when you trust the
[37:51] Lord, it's hard because you got trials,
[37:54] you got difficulties, you've got
[37:55] roadblocks, you got things standing in
[37:57] the way, you've got you don't got people
[37:59] that cooperating, you got you don't got
[38:00] a checkbook that cooperates. There's
[38:02] things standing in the way. So trusting
[38:04] the Lord is hard. So there's there's a
[38:06] process of tasting the Lord. Amen. It's
[38:09] this process
[38:11] and the result of our complete trust is
[38:16] seeing the blessings of God, his
[38:19] goodness in our lives. In other words,
[38:22] you go through that process of of
[38:24] tasting, trusting, and at the end we see
[38:28] the goodness of God. Taste and see that
[38:31] the Lord is good. Amen. And it's at the
[38:34] end that when the blessings come, you
[38:36] can say of assurityity, God is good. God
[38:40] is a good God. Oh, taste and see that
[38:43] the Lord is good. Blessed is the man
[38:46] that trustth in the Lord. Amen.
[38:52] Now, we all have felt that we trusted in
[38:57] the
[38:58] Lord and that the Lord, he let us down.
[39:03] Right? We've all been there. I trust the
[39:06] Lord. Didn't get what I wanted. He let
[39:09] me down.
[39:13] But the real the real question is, did
[39:15] we trust the Lord?
[39:18] Because anybody can say, "I'm going to
[39:20] trust God right now for a million
[39:22] dollars. I'm going to get it tomorrow."
[39:26] Anybody can say that.
[39:29] But that there's no scripture for that.
[39:35] But there is scripture that that God
[39:38] will supply my needs according to his
[39:40] riches and glory. There is scripture for
[39:42] that. And if we put our our trust in the
[39:46] scripture, we have every right to expect
[39:49] it to happen. Amen. Psalms 23:6 says,
[39:53] "Surely goodness and mercy shall follow
[39:55] me all the days of my life."
[39:59] Goodness and mercy follow me. Why does
[40:02] it follow me? Because I am trusting God
[40:08] in my life. If you trust God presently,
[40:12] goodness and mercy follows you.
[40:16] But if you're waiting for God to do
[40:17] something before you're going to trust
[40:20] him, it don't work like that. Amen.
[40:23] Psalms
[40:24] 32:10 says, "Many sorrows shall be to
[40:28] the
[40:29] wicked, but he that trusteth in the
[40:31] Lord, mercy shall compass him about."
[40:35] Right? We get mercy by simply trusting
[40:39] in God.
[40:42] But the wicked, they don't get that that
[40:46] that mercy that you know
[40:49] compassing. Imagine compassing.
[40:52] I
[40:55] mean, you walk into a room and it's on
[40:57] fire, though. Fire's everywhere. It's
[40:58] compass everywhere.
[41:00] I mean, I I want my life to be full of
[41:03] mercy, right? Mercy everywhere. Just
[41:05] come pass me about everywhere. It It
[41:08] doesn't happen until I step out by faith
[41:10] and trust God.
[41:13] Trust God in my situation. And we all
[41:16] got different situations in our life.
[41:18] Amen.
[41:22] and we wonder what's going to go on here
[41:23] and what's going to happen here
[41:25] and but when we can step out and trust
[41:28] God that he's with us
[41:31] and that he's going to see us
[41:34] through that though none go with me
[41:38] still I'll follow right that that trust
[41:42] where you everything is in
[41:44] God and then you can have confidence
[41:48] according to the word that even Even
[41:50] when you slip and fall, mercy is going
[41:51] to be there.
[41:55] Compass with
[41:57] mercy. Jeremiah chapter 17 verse 7. And
[42:01] this is this is the scripture that
[42:03] really started this whole message. And
[42:05] really, it started by a little cross
[42:09] that in our house that is was laying on
[42:11] the counter. And I just saw that and I
[42:14] just picked it up. I put it by my
[42:17] bedside for a while. And this is the
[42:18] scripture
[42:20] here. Blessed is the man that trusteth
[42:24] in the
[42:25] Lord and whose hope the Lord is.
[42:30] A man is literally blessed
[42:34] when he trusts in God.
[42:38] Now, there's a lot of people that go to
[42:40] church and there's a lot of people who
[42:41] don't go to church who say they trust
[42:44] God. Amen. But do we really know what it
[42:48] means to trust?
[42:50] Because we know what it means to be
[42:52] blessed.
[42:54] And when we don't seem to feel like
[42:56] we're being blessed, we need to look at
[42:58] whether we're trusting enough.
[43:03] Because the more you trust, the more
[43:04] you're blessed.
[43:07] When you trust a little, you're blessed
[43:09] a little.
[43:11] And it's hard to to uh to to fathom and
[43:16] understand, but we reap what we
[43:18] sow. And when we can when we can begin
[43:21] to sow, I I trust God with my entire
[43:24] soul, with my entire life, with my
[43:27] entire finances, with my entire time.
[43:31] You know, if the word of God says, uh,
[43:33] forsake not the summoning of yourselves
[43:35] together, all the more you see the day
[43:37] approaching, I trust that word. I trust
[43:39] it above my circumstances.
[43:42] If the Bible says that that that that we
[43:44] are to to pray without ceasing, then I'm
[43:47] going to trust God, then I'm going to
[43:48] pray without ceasing. If the Bible says
[43:50] to pay your tithes, to give to give
[43:53] offerings, to put them first, uh
[43:55] whatever the word says, that is what I
[43:57] will do. I will trust God with his word.
[44:00] Amen.
[44:02] You don't trust God with your feelings
[44:04] and your emotions and ignore what he
[44:08] wants you to do.
[44:11] Now look, this is just verse 8 here of
[44:14] Jeremiah 17. It kind of gives a little a
[44:18] little what it means to be blessed of
[44:21] the Lord. That's right. Just from simply
[44:24] trusting in God in your life. For he
[44:27] shall be as a tree
[44:29] planted by the
[44:33] waters, and that spreadth out her root
[44:36] by the
[44:37] rivers, and shall not see when heat
[44:43] cometh. But her leaf shall be green, and
[44:46] shall not be careful in the year of
[44:49] drought, neither shall she cease from
[44:52] yielding fruit. Amen. And why is
[44:57] that? Because the roots go deep into
[45:00] trusting in God. And that is where
[45:03] you'll meet God. There's where you'll
[45:04] get rivers of water of life. That's
[45:07] where you'll get joy. You'll get peace.
[45:09] You'll get all that you need in Christ.
[45:12] But you got to trust in him. You can't
[45:14] go to church and try to be some peacock,
[45:17] some sort of Christian that you put on.
[45:19] You got to live the life. It's got to be
[45:21] inside of you. Amen. You got to truly
[45:24] trust the word of God.
[45:27] There are benefits that only transpire
[45:30] when a man has a firm belief in God's
[45:34] reliability.
[45:40] I always like the little the story
[45:42] that's told about this man who could uh
[45:45] you know take a wheelbarrow back and
[45:46] forth over Niagara Falls and everybody
[45:48] just we know you can do it. We know you
[45:51] can do it.
[45:53] But when they're asked to get in the
[45:54] wheelbarrow and go with him, there's a
[45:57] little question whether he can still do
[45:58] it.
[46:04] But we've got to learn. This name of
[46:06] this message is learning to lean. We got
[46:08] to learn on to lean on God a little bit
[46:10] more than what we do. Amen.
[46:14] There are benefits that only are
[46:17] released to the man who has confidence
[46:19] in the word of God as his absolute.
[46:24] We anybody Hey, the the world is full of
[46:26] churches who believe in God in the way
[46:29] they want to believe in God. But Jesus
[46:32] says, "You've got to believe on me as
[46:34] the scriptures teach you to believe."
[46:37] The scriptures teach us to believe. God
[46:39] is not partial. God is not part God.
[46:43] He's all God. He's all God. So his his
[46:47] word is
[46:48] important. And and the word is filled
[46:52] with what we need to face every
[46:54] situation in our life. There's something
[46:57] in this word to help us with every
[46:59] situation we got.
[47:02] Now, I'm going to tell you, there was a
[47:03] a a couple of times in my life that I
[47:07] did not have any
[47:10] finances. And Brother Bruce was probably
[47:13] the first one, the first time in my in
[47:17] our life that that I didn't have
[47:20] finances. And um didn't have money to
[47:22] even get the car fixed. And that's where
[47:24] Brother Bruce came in. He came over and
[47:25] worked on I think our I don't know if it
[47:28] was our Volkswagen. I don't know what it
[47:29] was. I can't remember right now, but he
[47:31] helped us got the car going and we we
[47:33] had a car to get back and forth to
[47:35] church.
[47:39] But there comes a time in everybody's
[47:41] life that you've got to believe that God
[47:45] is able to meet every one of your needs
[47:47] in your life.
[47:50] And you don't wait till you get money to
[47:52] trust God.
[47:55] You trust God when you don't have money.
[47:57] You you you you give your tithes when
[47:59] you don't got money to give your tithes.
[48:04] Anybody can trust when you don't have to
[48:07] trust,
[48:09] right? But when you don't have what you
[48:11] need,
[48:13] God wants to be God in your life. Amen.
[48:20] Man is either trusting God or he's
[48:22] trusting himself.
[48:24] One or the other. The middle verse in
[48:27] the Bible, Psalms 118:8. It is better to
[48:30] trust in the Lord than to put confidence
[48:34] in man. Amen. I'll say it like this.
[48:37] It's better to put your trust in God
[48:40] than to put your confidence in yourself.
[48:42] To lean to the arm of
[48:43] flesh. When a man's trust is in God, he
[48:47] is actually trusting the word of
[48:50] God. Not just how do I know I'm trusting
[48:54] God? I don't even know God unless I know
[48:58] the word. You understand what I'm
[49:00] saying? The word becomes God. The word
[49:03] is God. In the beginning was the word.
[49:05] The word was with God. And the word was
[49:07] God. I it's it's wrong for me to say I
[49:09] trust God, but I'm not that interested
[49:11] in reading my Bible today.
[49:18] I mean, we may say, "I trust God. I need
[49:21] God for my situation. I know the Bible's
[49:24] true.
[49:25] I know the Bible's not a lie, but we're
[49:28] still not digging into it to find out
[49:31] God, what what scripture do you want me
[49:33] to hold on to today for my situation?
[49:36] What word what what word do you have for
[49:38] me personally today? In other words, we
[49:41] don't want to wait to time to go to
[49:43] church to find out what the Bible is
[49:45] saying.
[49:46] We need a personal walk with God to
[49:49] where there's an interest, a personal
[49:51] interest in our life to get in the Bible
[49:54] and read it on a daily basis.
[49:58] If that's if that's missing, just
[50:00] institute it. Do not wait till you have
[50:03] a great day and or somebody remind you,
[50:06] make it a habit. Read the word because
[50:09] that's you're giving God a chance to
[50:11] speak to you. You're cultivating that
[50:14] atmosphere.
[50:16] All right. Verse Psalms 56:3 says, "What
[50:20] time I am
[50:23] afraid, I will trust in thee." You ever
[50:26] been afraid
[50:29] before? Have you ever been afraid
[50:31] before? Have you ever done something
[50:34] wrong and you did not Your mom knew
[50:37] about it, but you didn't want your dad
[50:39] to know about it?
[50:41] Yeah. and you said to your mom, "Don't
[50:44] tell
[50:48] dad because you're afraid of what was
[50:50] going to
[50:52] happen." And a lot of times we all face
[50:56] fear, right? We we didn't do our
[50:59] homework. We didn't study our homework
[51:02] and now we got a test and we walk into
[51:05] class and we're scared to take that
[51:10] test every
[51:13] day. You ever been to the grocery store
[51:16] or I've done this. I go to the
[51:18] restaurant. I eat my nice meal and I go
[51:21] up to pay my bill and I don't got my
[51:23] wallet with me.
[51:26] And I'll wonder what am I going to tell
[51:28] them?
[51:30] Are they gonna They're probably not
[51:31] going to believe me. They They probably
[51:34] are thinking that I'm fibbing.
[51:40] Whatever the fears are, you have to face
[51:42] them. Amen. And you can do that when you
[51:46] trust God. Amen. Because God has not
[51:48] given us a spirit of fear. Amen. But of
[51:51] power, love, and of a sound mind. Verse
[51:53] four. In God, I will praise what? His
[51:56] word. Psalms 56:4. In God I will praise
[52:01] his
[52:02] word. In God I have put my trust. I will
[52:07] not fear what flesh can do unto me.
[52:10] Don't ever be afraid of another human
[52:13] being
[52:17] there is no God in that
[52:22] because God hasn't given us that that
[52:24] spirit of fear to fear another person.
[52:31] God said, "I'll never leave you. I'll
[52:34] never forsake you." And if a person is
[52:37] trying to bring upon a
[52:40] fear, well, we know that's of the devil.
[52:45] Are you with me? Amen. Can you say amen?
[52:48] How about this? Can you say I'm never
[52:50] going to make anybody fear anymore? Can
[52:52] you say that? I will not make any other
[52:55] person fear anymore.
[52:58] Yeah, I think that's a good thing we
[52:59] could do to make that commitment that
[53:02] I'm gonna I'm gonna I'm gonna use
[53:04] character to help somebody see the
[53:06] light. I'm going to use a a a love and a
[53:09] and a trust and a and and I'm going to
[53:12] make people feel comfortable
[53:16] because you know what fear does? It
[53:17] manipulates people.
[53:21] And we're not into manipulation, right?
[53:24] Trust in God's
[53:28] word. Trust is the weapon needed to face
[53:32] any fear. Trust. Trust in God that he's
[53:35] with you. God will reward the man who
[53:39] trusts in him. He will bless the man
[53:41] whose hope is the Lord. All right.
[53:43] Psalms 27 verse1. We're going to have to
[53:45] go kind of quick because I've been in
[53:47] this before. If you do not hurry, you do
[53:50] not get everything done. And I want to
[53:51] get everything done today. Psalms 27:1,
[53:55] "The Lord is my light and my salvation.
[53:58] Whom shall I fear? The Lord is the
[54:00] strength of my life. Whom shall I be
[54:03] afraid?"
[54:04] When the wicked, even my enemies and my
[54:06] foes came upon me to eat up my flesh,
[54:08] they stumbled and
[54:10] fell. Well, why why' that happen?
[54:13] Because David is expressing here that in
[54:18] the midst of the fear that he faced that
[54:21] he had a trust in God. Yes, sir. Yes.
[54:25] And that's what we need. We we we need
[54:28] to trust God more. Amen. I I'm thankful
[54:31] for how much I trust God, but I need to
[54:33] trust him more.
[54:35] Though a host should encamp against me,
[54:38] my heart, this thing here, this thing
[54:41] here, shall not fear, though war should
[54:44] rise up against me. In this I be
[54:47] confident one thing, have a desired of
[54:48] the Lord, that I seek after that I may
[54:50] dwell in the house of the Lord all the
[54:53] days of my life. To behold the beauty of
[54:54] the Lord, to choir in his temple. For in
[54:57] the time of trouble, he shall hide me in
[55:00] his pavilion. How many times you ever
[55:02] come to church? God, I need a word from
[55:04] you.
[55:08] Now, it may not be the word that you're
[55:13] were wanting to hear, but he will give
[55:16] you a word to trust in him.
[55:19] I believe that with all my heart. For in
[55:21] the time of trouble, he shall hide me in
[55:23] his priv. He in the secret of his
[55:25] tabernacle shall he hide me. He shall
[55:28] set me upon a rock. Now, that's good
[55:29] enough for me right there. That's good
[55:32] enough for me. They asked Brother
[55:33] Brandham, I if the bombs are going to
[55:35] come down, where do you want to be? Do
[55:37] you want you want to be in heaven? You
[55:39] want to be in a bomb shelter? Where do
[55:41] you want to be? He said, I want to be in
[55:43] the word.
[55:45] The word. That's the secret place of
[55:48] God. The the word. That's that's our
[55:50] protection. That's our rock. And that's
[55:54] why I'm saying it's important to trust
[55:56] in the word of God and and to step away
[55:58] from saying, "I trust in God." but kind
[56:01] of ignoring the word. Amen. Get in love
[56:04] with the word. Okay. And now shall my
[56:07] head be lifted up above my enemies round
[56:09] about me. Therefore, offer in his
[56:11] tabernacle sacrifices of joy. I will
[56:13] sing. Yay. I will sing praises unto the
[56:15] Lord. Let me ask you a question. Today,
[56:17] today in the worship service, how many
[56:20] offered up sacrifices of
[56:23] joy? I mean you from your heart, you
[56:26] said, "I praise you, Lord." Amen. That's
[56:29] his word. Amen. You got to trust the
[56:32] word. You don't wait till you feel like
[56:34] praising God. You praise him because the
[56:37] word tells you to. Amen. And when you
[56:40] trust the word above your feelings and
[56:42] your emotions, then you you're getting
[56:43] somewhere. We get somewhere with God.
[56:45] Amen. Psalms 31:19. Oh, how great is thy
[56:50] goodness, which thou has laid up for
[56:53] who? For them that fear thee.
[56:57] which thou has wrought for them that
[56:59] trust in thee before the sons of
[57:03] men. So how great is the goodness of
[57:07] God? It's laid out for
[57:09] them who has who trust in God. How
[57:14] important it is to trust. I just think
[57:15] we miss out on a lot of blessings
[57:17] because we don't trust God. We literally
[57:20] try to figure everything out, handle all
[57:21] the problems. This is what we're going
[57:23] to do. This is how we're going to do it.
[57:26] True. And even if the thing gets worked
[57:28] out, you miss out on the blessings.
[57:31] Because when you trust God, things
[57:33] happen. Things happen. Thou shalt hide
[57:37] them in the secret of thy presence from
[57:39] the
[57:40] pride of men. Look what happens from God
[57:44] hides the
[57:45] blessings. He hides the
[57:49] blessings from them in the secret of his
[57:53] presence from the proud
[57:56] person. Thou shalt keep them secretly in
[58:00] a pavilion from the strife of tongues.
[58:04] So God has a way of blessing us when we
[58:07] trust him, right? And it's a proudful
[58:10] thing that I can handle it without God.
[58:12] I don't need to do what the word says.
[58:13] I'm just going to do it my way.
[58:18] All right, look at these blessings from
[58:21] trusting the word of God here in Psalms
[58:23] 18 verse 28. Psalms 18:28. For
[58:27] thou will light my
[58:29] candle. The Lord my God will enlighten
[58:33] my darkness. What a what a promise. For
[58:36] thou will light my candle. You we've
[58:39] heard the song go light your go light
[58:41] your Is it go light your world? It is go
[58:44] light your world.
[58:45] But in that song, it talks about candle,
[58:48] right? It talks about a candle. And the
[58:51] promise is we're all a candle. We're all
[58:54] a light. And and and we can get lit for
[58:57] the Lord my God will enlighten my
[58:59] darkness. That's why we come to church
[59:00] to find out our darkness. We go through
[59:03] the course of the day, the course of the
[59:05] week, and we think we're okay doing what
[59:07] we're doing. We come to church with an
[59:09] open heart and we say, "God, you show me
[59:12] get the darkness out of my life. Jesus.
[59:16] Verse 29. For by thee I have run through
[59:20] a troop. By who? By the Lord. Because
[59:24] you're trusting in God. By by thee. For
[59:27] by thee I have run through a chup. And
[59:29] by my God I have leaped over a wall.
[59:32] As for God, his way is perfect. The word
[59:36] of the Lord is tried. He's a buckler to
[59:39] all those that trust in him.
[59:43] That word buckler means a shield, a
[59:45] protector, a defense to all those who
[59:49] trust in him. But if we don't trust him,
[59:53] like like I just I I it's
[59:57] got like you have to figure it out
[1:00:00] yourself or it has to work out this way.
[1:00:03] You know, God cannot be your shield.
[1:00:06] Amen. He can't protect you. He can't be
[1:00:08] your defense. Why? because you said, "I
[1:00:12] don't need you, Lord. I've got this
[1:00:14] handled."
[1:00:19] God puts us in those
[1:00:21] situations to where we can we make a
[1:00:23] choice. Now, what we should have handled
[1:00:26] is what we know to do. That's what we
[1:00:28] should have handled. What we should have
[1:00:30] handled is I'm going to read. I'm going
[1:00:32] to pray. I'm going to be faithful at
[1:00:34] church. I'm going to learn to give back
[1:00:35] to the kingdom of what is given to me.
[1:00:37] God has blessed me. I'm gonna give more
[1:00:39] of myself to him. Amen. Now, that's what
[1:00:42] we can do.
[1:00:44] And when it comes to
[1:00:46] problems that really we just can't
[1:00:49] handle at that point, what we need to
[1:00:51] say is, "God, I trust you.
[1:00:53] I'm learning to lean on you, Lord.
[1:00:57] I'm learning to
[1:00:58] lean." Let's just say that, Brother
[1:01:01] James, he's got a problem with me. And
[1:01:03] he's getting really upset at me. He's uh
[1:01:06] jumping down my throat because it's been
[1:01:08] more than 60 minutes at a
[1:01:13] sermon. And I can take this situation in
[1:01:15] my hands and I can say, "Listen here,
[1:01:17] brother James. I'm the pastor. You are
[1:01:19] not the pastor. I'll preach as long as I
[1:01:21] want to praise and you better get used
[1:01:23] to
[1:01:24] it."
[1:01:26] Or I can look at the word and the word
[1:01:28] says a soft answer turns away wrath.
[1:01:34] So either I can put my trust in myself
[1:01:38] or I can put the trust in the word.
[1:01:40] Amen.
[1:01:41] Notice if I put my trust in myself, I'm
[1:01:44] going to bring about some fear, right?
[1:01:46] Some fear. I'm going to put some fear
[1:01:48] and put some fear in this man.
[1:01:52] But if I I I I I fear the word. Amen. I
[1:01:56] if I fear the word, I I I trust the
[1:01:58] word. Amen.
[1:02:01] Then there's no fear here.
[1:02:04] The responsibility comes
[1:02:06] here and it brings the blessings of
[1:02:09] peace and settlement whatever the issue
[1:02:13] might be. Can you say amen? Amen.
[1:02:15] Blessed is the man that trusteth in the
[1:02:17] Lord and whose hope the Lord is. All
[1:02:20] right. Psalms 125 verse1. Psalms 125
[1:02:24] verse1. They that trust in the Lord
[1:02:27] shall be as mount Zion.
[1:02:30] which cannot be removed but abideth for.
[1:02:35] Look at this promise by just trusting in
[1:02:39] God to be as strong as a mountain and
[1:02:43] not just a mountain but Mount Zion which
[1:02:45] represents God,
[1:02:47] right?
[1:02:49] Which cannot be moved. You ever been
[1:02:52] talking to somebody and they're so set
[1:02:55] in their ways, they go like this, I
[1:02:57] ain't I ain't listening to you. I don't
[1:02:59] need I don't need to listen to you. You
[1:03:00] don't Nobody's going to tell me. And
[1:03:03] they're going to stand there. I'm going
[1:03:06] to go here. I'm going to do this. I'm
[1:03:08] going
[1:03:11] to in the flesh. We can get like
[1:03:15] that. But can we get like that in the
[1:03:18] word? Can we get like that with God? Can
[1:03:22] you stand there in the face of your
[1:03:24] enemy when he's slapping you, hitting
[1:03:26] you, talking behind your back, uh,
[1:03:30] gossiping about you, and do all these.
[1:03:32] Can you stand there and not be moved?
[1:03:37] The only way you can is by trusting in
[1:03:39] God.
[1:03:41] When you truly trust in God, you know
[1:03:43] what? You get a peace. Amen.
[1:03:48] You you you get
[1:03:50] joy like the three Hebrew children had,
[1:03:53] like Daniel
[1:03:55] had. You get love. You get compassion.
[1:03:58] You feel sorry for the persons
[1:04:01] who are acting the way they're acting.
[1:04:03] That is the truth. But that only comes
[1:04:05] from trusting in God. It doesn't come
[1:04:08] from, well, I got to do this. I somehow
[1:04:10] got to turn the other cheek. It doesn't
[1:04:12] come from that because you can turn the
[1:04:15] cheek and not trust God. Yes, sir. And
[1:04:17] then when you get hit on the other side,
[1:04:19] you're finally said, "That's enough."
[1:04:22] Right? But when you trust God, you are
[1:04:25] blessed beyond anything that you can
[1:04:27] muster up in yourself.
[1:04:30] I just really believe in the trust of
[1:04:32] the Lord. Amen. Verse two, as the
[1:04:34] mountains are round about Jerusalem, so
[1:04:37] is so the Lord is round about his people
[1:04:42] from henceforth, even forever more. How
[1:04:45] many How many is a people of God? Say,
[1:04:47] "Amen." Amen. You have the promise right
[1:04:49] here that the Lord is around you. Amen.
[1:04:54] That's right. But you got to trust him.
[1:04:56] Amen. You You're excluded if you don't
[1:04:59] trust. Remember the children of Israel
[1:05:01] came out of Egypt. They trusted God
[1:05:04] coming
[1:05:05] out, but they did not maintain that
[1:05:08] trust when they said, "Okay, there's the
[1:05:09] promised land. Let's go." And he had to
[1:05:12] destroy them. And the only difference,
[1:05:14] it wasn't because they was his people,
[1:05:15] not his people. It was because they
[1:05:18] refused to trust God.
[1:05:21] But Joshua and Caleb, they were of
[1:05:23] another spirit. The Bible says they they
[1:05:25] wholly followed or wholly trusted the
[1:05:27] word. Amen.
[1:05:31] Proverbs 16:20 says, "He that handleth a
[1:05:35] man a matter wisely shall find good, and
[1:05:39] who so trusteth in the
[1:05:42] Lord, happy is he." That's right. If you
[1:05:46] ever find yourself
[1:05:48] sad, there is one thing you need to do.
[1:05:54] Trust God. And if for some reason you
[1:05:58] can't trust God, th this is the next
[1:06:01] step right here. This is the next step.
[1:06:03] You get down on your knees and you stay
[1:06:06] there until you can trust him.
[1:06:10] There is no other answer to being happy.
[1:06:13] We sing the song trust and obey. There
[1:06:15] is no other way to be happy in Jesus but
[1:06:19] to trust and obey.
[1:06:23] The blessings of happiness comes as a
[1:06:25] result of personally trusting God. You
[1:06:27] know what also comes? I made mention of
[1:06:29] it. Peace. Isaiah 26:3, "Thou shalt keep
[1:06:32] him in perfect peace whose mind is
[1:06:34] stayed on the Lord." Why is that?
[1:06:36] Because here's the answer. He trustth in
[1:06:39] thee. Amen.
[1:06:42] Trust in the
[1:06:44] Lord. You know what you got to do? You
[1:06:46] got to defy all the feelings and
[1:06:48] emotions and the thoughts that come into
[1:06:50] your head.
[1:06:52] We get played. What about this? What
[1:06:53] about this? I got this problem. I'm
[1:06:55] dealing with this and I've got this and
[1:06:56] I don't got time for this and I got all
[1:06:58] this going on and you don't understand.
[1:07:00] No. What you don't understand is the
[1:07:01] word has not become your absolute.
[1:07:03] That's what you don't understand.
[1:07:06] Amen.
[1:07:09] I mean, look what the the three Hebrew
[1:07:12] children, they didn't have any escape.
[1:07:16] They didn't have any escape. Daniel
[1:07:18] didn't have any
[1:07:20] escape. But you know what they both had?
[1:07:23] They they had trust in God. Amen.
[1:07:27] And these examples in the Bible are just
[1:07:30] not
[1:07:31] stories. They're for our admonition.
[1:07:34] They're to teach us how to trust God in
[1:07:37] 2025.
[1:07:39] That God is just the same yesterday,
[1:07:41] today, and forever. and that he can meet
[1:07:44] our need not because of our ability or
[1:07:47] our smarts
[1:07:49] even by how faithful we have been. All
[1:07:52] we have to do is repent, turn around and
[1:07:55] begin to walk in the light. Amen. And
[1:07:58] God will beat you there. He'll meet you
[1:08:01] there. The blessing of perfect peace
[1:08:04] comes as a result of personally now
[1:08:07] personally putting your trust in there.
[1:08:08] Well, uh you know, brother John, my
[1:08:11] daddy won't do it. my mom won't do it,
[1:08:13] my husband won't do it, my wife won't do
[1:08:15] it, and they're doing this. And you know
[1:08:17] what? I don't care if the whole church
[1:08:18] just quits. If God has called you to
[1:08:22] trust him, you trust him. Amen. Don't
[1:08:25] wait for everybody to get on board. It
[1:08:27] may be just you that goes in the
[1:08:29] rapture. Amen. Amen. We need to be
[1:08:33] thinking like that. Oh, I would like to
[1:08:34] all go as a whole, right? But let's be
[1:08:37] honest. Let's be honest.
[1:08:40] Hey, everybody don't have the same
[1:08:42] desire.
[1:08:44] I hate to say that.
[1:08:50] I mean, we've got to love the Lord with
[1:08:52] all the heart, with all of our soul,
[1:08:54] with all of our might. Do we? Are we
[1:08:55] passing that test?
[1:08:58] So, I just say it like this. You be the
[1:09:00] one. You be the one. Say, though none go
[1:09:04] with me, still I'll follow the word.
[1:09:06] Amen. I'll follow the word. Amen. Amen.
[1:09:09] All right. Okay, so we got this here.
[1:09:10] Now, I want you to trust this right
[1:09:12] here. Philippians chapter 4, verse 8,
[1:09:14] still talking about peace. Finally,
[1:09:15] brethren, whatsoever things are true and
[1:09:18] honest,
[1:09:20] just and pure and lovely and of a good
[1:09:25] report.
[1:09:28] If there be any strength, if there be
[1:09:31] any
[1:09:31] praise, then think on these things. So,
[1:09:35] you've got to trust this word for peace.
[1:09:38] these things which you have both learned
[1:09:40] and received and heard and seen in me do
[1:09:42] and the God of peace shall be with you.
[1:09:45] In other words, you can you can trust
[1:09:47] God that he's the same yesterday, today,
[1:09:48] and for he's not going to change. This
[1:09:50] wasn't only for Paul. This is for you
[1:09:52] and I. Amen.
[1:09:55] It's not always easy to trust the Lord.
[1:09:57] It can be difficult when we're going
[1:10:00] through trials and tests.
[1:10:02] But if you if you truly trust him, the
[1:10:07] reward I'll say it like this, it's
[1:10:10] priceless. I'm going to say this.
[1:10:13] I've never experienced anything in my
[1:10:20] life that could
[1:10:22] cure
[1:10:27] being hated by somebody to the extreme
[1:10:31] that they would want to hurt you.
[1:10:36] I have never experienced anything in my
[1:10:38] life that could take care of that
[1:10:40] situation than the love of God. Amen.
[1:10:45] When the love of God comes in your
[1:10:48] heart, that thing is taken care of.
[1:10:51] Amen.
[1:10:53] I'm going to say it like this. It wasn't
[1:10:54] like everybody repented
[1:10:57] against Jesus. All all the all the wrong
[1:11:00] all the things they did. You know what
[1:11:02] I'm saying? It isn't like we're going to
[1:11:03] get to a place when we're friends with
[1:11:06] everybody. Right. Right. And in fact, if
[1:11:08] it's happen, beware if all men speak
[1:11:11] well of you. Right.
[1:11:13] So, I just say it like this. I'd rather
[1:11:15] have Jesus than anything.
[1:11:18] And if you could just trust him, the
[1:11:20] love will come. It'll just take care of
[1:11:21] every situation. It really will.
[1:11:25] Jonah. Jonah. The Bible says in Jonah 1
[1:11:28] that Jonah rose up to flee unto Tarsus
[1:11:32] from the presence of the Lord. You ever
[1:11:34] do you ever just kind of flee from
[1:11:36] putting your heart into going to church?
[1:11:38] You ever been in that spot? like I yeah
[1:11:41] I got something else going on.
[1:11:45] But T
[1:11:48] Jonah, he didn't stop believing in God.
[1:11:52] He just stopped serving God.
[1:11:55] Right? A lot of people they say they
[1:11:57] they they they
[1:11:58] they still believe in God, but they stop
[1:12:01] doing what they that God wants them to
[1:12:03] do.
[1:12:06] And so the Bible says they took up Jonah
[1:12:10] and they cast him. You know this the the
[1:12:12] the the story and they cast him forth
[1:12:15] into the sea and the sea ceased from her
[1:12:18] raging because God had arranged this
[1:12:21] right now. The Lord had prepared a great
[1:12:25] fish to swallow up Jonah. And Jonah was
[1:12:28] in the belly of the fish for three days
[1:12:31] and three nights. How would you like to
[1:12:33] see a Netflix picture on this happening
[1:12:37] right inside the middle
[1:12:40] of this prepared
[1:12:45] fish? This I don't think would be the
[1:12:49] kind of vacation I would want to go on.
[1:12:53] Jonah chapter 2 verse one. Then Jonah
[1:12:55] prayed unto the Lord his God and out of
[1:12:59] the fish's belly. Thank you, Jesus. Oh
[1:13:02] my my. In the middle of the deepest
[1:13:05] trial that we could be in, even if we
[1:13:08] were the one that got us there, the
[1:13:10] truth that we can find God in that
[1:13:14] situation if we trust him. Amen. That's
[1:13:17] right. We need to learn how to pray unto
[1:13:20] God from the middle of our trouble. The
[1:13:23] Bible says that he's a present help in a
[1:13:25] time of trouble. Amen. Even if we cause
[1:13:27] the trouble. So I I'll just say as we
[1:13:30] read this, let's learn to lean upon God
[1:13:34] a little bit more. Verse
[1:13:36] two, and said, I cried by reason of my
[1:13:40] affliction unto the Lord, and he heard
[1:13:43] me. Out of the belly of hell cried I,
[1:13:48] and thou heardest my voice. For thou
[1:13:51] hast hast cast me into the deep in the
[1:13:54] midst of the sea and the floods compass
[1:13:56] me about. All thy billows and thy waves
[1:14:00] passed over
[1:14:03] me. Then said, I I am cast out of thy
[1:14:09] sight. He was honest. He was in a
[1:14:12] situation where he knew God was not
[1:14:14] pleased with him. That's right. And he
[1:14:18] was the one that caused it. That's
[1:14:19] right.
[1:14:22] And you know, I look at this
[1:14:24] situation and even though he ran from
[1:14:26] the presence of the Lord, because he
[1:14:28] belonged to God, now I want you to catch
[1:14:30] this. Because he belonged to God, God
[1:14:34] prepared a way for him to come back.
[1:14:41] Now, he didn't get Jonah. He He didn't
[1:14:45] get one of the men that was on the ship
[1:14:48] and get Jonah in a headlock, hit him a
[1:14:50] couple times and said, "You better start
[1:14:52] serving the Lord."
[1:14:55] He didn't do
[1:14:57] that. He let him go so far and said,
[1:15:01] "You know what? We're just going to make
[1:15:03] life miserable for you." That is the
[1:15:06] truth. Got him to the place
[1:15:10] where he didn't have any place to run
[1:15:13] to. That is the truth.
[1:15:16] And so, let's pick this up. And then I
[1:15:19] said, I I I I am cast out of thy sight,
[1:15:22] yet I will look again toward thy holy
[1:15:26] temple. Amen.
[1:15:28] He remembered the word of God. Amen. He
[1:15:33] remembered the word of God. Yet, I will
[1:15:36] humble myself to trust in the word. I
[1:15:39] will humble myself and learn to lean
[1:15:42] upon him. right now in this situation
[1:15:45] cuz I don't have I don't have anything
[1:15:48] that says to me, you know what, in three
[1:15:50] days I'm going to be spit out and I'm
[1:15:53] going to be okay and I'm going to keep
[1:15:54] running from God. That thought did not
[1:15:57] enter his head. What was in his head was
[1:16:00] all this seed, all this
[1:16:03] throw up stuff.
[1:16:06] Everything was there telling him he was.
[1:16:09] And I'm I'm sure when he went down into
[1:16:11] the deep, it like his ears were going to
[1:16:13] pop. The pressure was so great. You know
[1:16:15] what it is? You got to have the the the
[1:16:16] the the the all that stuff on your body
[1:16:20] or else you explode. Decompression, all
[1:16:23] this stuff that he was going through. We
[1:16:24] don't even know the half of it. But I'm
[1:16:26] telling you, it was enough to wake him
[1:16:27] up. Amen. It was enough to wake him
[1:16:31] up. And he said, "You know what? I'm at
[1:16:33] the place. I'm just going to look to the
[1:16:34] Lord.
[1:16:37] And today, if we're standing here in a
[1:16:40] situation, alls we need to do is look to
[1:16:42] the Lord.
[1:16:44] The waters compass me about even to the
[1:16:47] soul. The depths closed me round about.
[1:16:50] The weeds were wrapped around about my
[1:16:52] head. And I went down to the bottom of
[1:16:54] the mountains, the bottom of the
[1:16:57] sea. And the earth with her bars was
[1:17:00] before me forever.
[1:17:03] Yet hast thou brought me up my life from
[1:17:08] corruption, oh Lord my God. And when my
[1:17:12] soul fainted within
[1:17:15] me like I didn't have anywhere to go, I
[1:17:18] remembered. It's why it's important to
[1:17:20] come to church. It's why it's important
[1:17:21] to read the B. It's why it's important
[1:17:23] to listen to the tapes so you remember.
[1:17:26] Amen. My soul fainted within me, and I
[1:17:29] remembered the Lord, and my prayer came
[1:17:31] unto thee, and th into thy holy
[1:17:35] temple. They that observe lying vanities
[1:17:39] forsake their own mercies. I think this
[1:17:42] scripture to me, we should write this
[1:17:44] down and put this in one of our favorite
[1:17:47] spots
[1:17:49] because I'm telling you, when we're in a
[1:17:51] real trouble, when we're in a real
[1:17:54] trouble, what we want to do is
[1:17:56] straighten the other person out.
[1:18:01] But what we should be doing is looking
[1:18:03] at that situation and say, "They that
[1:18:05] observe lying vanities forsake their own
[1:18:08] mercies."
[1:18:10] God has mercy for us if we trust him.
[1:18:13] Because Jonah was in the worst possible
[1:18:16] situation that he could be in. He caused
[1:18:18] it. It wasn't a trial that just came. He
[1:18:20] caused the whole thing to happen.
[1:18:23] And in the midst of his disobedience, he
[1:18:26] trusted in God. He trusted in the word
[1:18:30] and God
[1:18:32] successfully delivered him. Amen.
[1:18:37] I love that.
[1:18:38] Jonah identified his situation as just a
[1:18:43] lying vanity.
[1:18:46] And this is hard to do because I mean,
[1:18:47] you got seaweed wrapped around your
[1:18:49] head. You're you're smelling this. It's
[1:18:51] dark. There's no candles in that belly,
[1:18:55] right? There was no soft music playing.
[1:18:58] There was no just relax. You'll get
[1:18:59] through this. You know when you're on
[1:19:00] the dentist
[1:19:02] chair or you're you're in the getting an
[1:19:05] MRI and b relax, everything will be
[1:19:08] okay. There was nothing to relax you in
[1:19:10] that in that great prepared fish.
[1:19:13] Nothing.
[1:19:15] So when you're in a situation, you
[1:19:18] didn't see it coming, you can still
[1:19:20] trust God. Amen. You can still trust
[1:19:23] him. You can go God will still meet you
[1:19:25] there if you call the situation a lie
[1:19:27] vanity. Why? because my God is here to
[1:19:29] deliver me. God is here to deliver
[1:19:33] me. We just got to keep our eyes off the
[1:19:36] problem and trust God. Amen. Verse nine.
[1:19:39] But I will sacrifice unto thee with the
[1:19:42] voice of thanksgiving. I will pay
[1:19:45] that. I will pay that that I have vowed.
[1:19:52] Have you ever told the Lord, I'm going
[1:19:55] to serve you with all my heart?
[1:19:58] And then you found yourself, you weren't
[1:20:01] serving the Lord with all your heart.
[1:20:04] And you know what God is saying? Time to
[1:20:07] pay up. Time to pay up. Start time to
[1:20:10] start serving the Lord with all your
[1:20:11] heart. Whatever your vows have been
[1:20:14] because Jonah was not quite serving the
[1:20:17] Lord with all his heart, was he?
[1:20:21] Now, he believed in the Lord.
[1:20:24] He was the one that said, "Hey, the
[1:20:26] reason we got this problem is because of
[1:20:27] me. If you get rid of me, everything's
[1:20:30] going to be okay around your life. He
[1:20:33] knew enough
[1:20:36] about God to believe in God.
[1:20:39] But the devils believe and they
[1:20:42] tremble." Amen. But there was no
[1:20:45] submission. There's no submission to the
[1:20:47] word there. It wasn't until Jonah
[1:20:50] repented.
[1:20:52] That's all we got to do. Amen.
[1:20:56] Amen. And verse 10, and the Lord spake
[1:21:01] unto the fish, and it vomited out Jonah
[1:21:03] upon the dry land. Don't you want the
[1:21:06] Lord to speak to your
[1:21:08] situation and just spit you out of that
[1:21:10] situation?
[1:21:13] You know what you got to do to get spit
[1:21:15] out? Trust God. Trust
[1:21:19] God and you will be blessed. Amen. Let's
[1:21:22] turn to James chapter 4 verse
[1:21:26] 9. That's all the Lord wanted. Humble
[1:21:30] yourself and pay up. Right. Ver James
[1:21:32] chapter 4. I want you to think about
[1:21:34] Jonah right now in his
[1:21:37] situation. James 4:9. Be afflicted.
[1:21:40] Mourn, weep. Let your laughter be turned
[1:21:43] to mourning and your joy to
[1:21:45] heaviness. Jonah, this is what you got
[1:21:48] to do. Humble yourself in the sight of
[1:21:51] the Lord and he shall lift you up.
[1:21:54] Can you say amen? Amen. I love that
[1:21:56] word. I I think that's a good word. I
[1:21:57] think we should all be saying amen to
[1:21:58] that. Amen. Amen. Verse number six. But
[1:22:01] he giveth more grace wherefore he saith
[1:22:04] God. He resists the
[1:22:06] proud and he gives grace to the humble.
[1:22:09] So God puts us in a situation so we can
[1:22:11] be humble. So then we can be blessed.
[1:22:15] Submit yourself therefore to God. Resist
[1:22:17] the devil and he'll flee from you. Draw
[1:22:19] nigh to God, he'll draw nigh to you.
[1:22:20] Cleanse your hands, you sinners, and
[1:22:22] purify your heart, you
[1:22:25] doubleminded. You know, that's what was
[1:22:27] happening in the middle of that fish.
[1:22:30] That's what was happening in Jonah's
[1:22:31] heart. I mean, there was a cleansing
[1:22:33] taking place all because he humbled
[1:22:36] himself and said, "I choose to follow
[1:22:39] the Lord." I think, you know, a lot of
[1:22:40] times I look at Jonah and Jonah was
[1:22:43] running away from God. You know what had
[1:22:45] to happen? We're not We're not going
[1:22:47] about to get to where I want to get to
[1:22:49] today. I can see that right now. What's
[1:22:51] been happen? Did you move that clock,
[1:22:52] brother Marty?
[1:22:54] Did you move that ahead? You know, I I
[1:22:57] look at the situation with Jonah and I
[1:22:59] see that God was chasing after Jonah.
[1:23:06] You know, I think a lot of times in our
[1:23:07] lives, we're we're we're forcing God to
[1:23:09] chase us.
[1:23:12] But really what needs to happen is we
[1:23:14] need to start chasing after God. Amen.
[1:23:18] Chase after God and trust him.
[1:23:22] Don't keep forcing God to chase you
[1:23:23] down. You chase after him. Amen.
[1:23:26] Proverbs 18 says, "The name of the Lord
[1:23:29] is a strong tower and the righteous run
[1:23:32] into it and is
[1:23:36] safe." You chase after
[1:23:38] God. Chase after the word. Chase after
[1:23:41] the name of the Lord and you'll be
[1:23:45] safe. Chase after him. That word runth
[1:23:48] means speedily. Stretch out and run.
[1:23:53] Chase after God. Run speedily after
[1:23:56] Christ. Amen.
[1:23:59] Paul speaking in Philippians 3:12. Not
[1:24:02] as though I've already attained. Neither
[1:24:04] were already perfect, but I follow after
[1:24:06] if that I may apprehend for that which
[1:24:08] also I'm apprehended of Jesus Christ.
[1:24:11] Brethren, I don't count myself that I've
[1:24:13] apprehended, but this one thing I do.
[1:24:15] I'm forgetting those things which are in
[1:24:16] the past. You know, Jonah had to do
[1:24:19] this. He literally had to forget
[1:24:23] that I I wanted to run away from God. I
[1:24:27] wanted to run away from what God asked
[1:24:29] me to do, which was to go speak the word
[1:24:32] to somebody, right? reach out to to
[1:24:34] Nineveh and and and and give them
[1:24:36] Christ.
[1:24:37] Amen. He had to literally forget that
[1:24:40] his
[1:24:41] disobedience and submit to being
[1:24:43] obedient again. Amen. He had to he had
[1:24:46] to forget the mistake he made and get
[1:24:49] back to the obedience of what he needed
[1:24:51] to do.
[1:24:54] A lot of times we let the devil beat us
[1:24:56] over the head.
[1:24:59] We also need to forget our great
[1:25:01] victories.
[1:25:03] We need to forget about I came to church
[1:25:09] faithfully and four times last year.
[1:25:12] We need to forget about that. Why?
[1:25:15] Because I got to make sure I make it to
[1:25:17] church on
[1:25:18] Sunday. So I need to forget I can't rely
[1:25:22] on how good I was last year that I can
[1:25:25] just kind of easy, you know, coast over
[1:25:27] here, right? So we got to we got to
[1:25:29] forget certain things that hinder us
[1:25:32] from what? Reaching forth on to those
[1:25:36] things which are
[1:25:39] before. If we don't learn to forget
[1:25:42] certain things, it keeps us from trying.
[1:25:45] You ever felt like you're so defeated,
[1:25:47] you you feel like you're just
[1:25:48] downtrodded. You you got this mistake.
[1:25:50] You got upset. You yelled, "You should
[1:25:52] have did this. You don't even feel like
[1:25:53] going to church." You know what I'm
[1:25:55] talking about? Yes. Okay. Well, if you
[1:25:57] don't forget that, you're not going to
[1:25:59] reach forth with what God has for you.
[1:26:01] So, this is something that we can
[1:26:03] practice on a daily basis. And Paul said
[1:26:05] in verse 14, I press toward the mark for
[1:26:09] the prize of the high calling of God in
[1:26:12] Christ Jesus. That word press, it means
[1:26:16] to
[1:26:18] pursue, be willing to suffer, to press
[1:26:21] towards the mark or the goal. So if I
[1:26:24] was to ask today, what is the mark that
[1:26:27] you're pursuing
[1:26:31] today? What is the mark that you're
[1:26:33] pursuing
[1:26:35] today? Were you thinking, "Hey, as long
[1:26:38] as I make it to church,
[1:26:42] I hit the mark.
[1:26:44] I did it.
[1:26:45] Did it." Is that Is that what you're
[1:26:48] pursuing? Because we're all pursuing
[1:26:50] something, don't you think? Amen. We're
[1:26:52] all reaching forth. We're all trying to
[1:26:54] accomplish something. Amen.
[1:26:57] Well, if if if we're not chasing after
[1:27:01] God, we're chasing after something. And
[1:27:05] more than likely, if you're chasing
[1:27:06] after something, God is chasing after
[1:27:09] you.
[1:27:10] So, we need to better
[1:27:13] identify basically what we haven't
[1:27:15] apprehended so we can start looking
[1:27:17] towards apprehending the things that are
[1:27:20] before us. Jesus said in Luke 16:16 that
[1:27:23] every man presseth into the kingdom.
[1:27:26] Paul's telling us to press towards the
[1:27:28] mark. Jesus said, "Press into the
[1:27:30] kingdom." Every man presseth into the
[1:27:32] kingdom of
[1:27:34] God. I I want us to I'm going to try to
[1:27:36] get this done in in the six minutes that
[1:27:38] I have, but I want to at least get this
[1:27:40] this point across. There's so many I I
[1:27:42] think nuggets in this, but we're just
[1:27:44] we're just not going to be able to get
[1:27:45] to them. I want to talk about this
[1:27:48] pressing. Jesus said in Matthew 11:12,
[1:27:51] "And from the time from the days of John
[1:27:54] the Baptist until now, the kingdom of
[1:27:56] God suffereth violent, and the violent
[1:27:58] taketh it by force." So the kingdom of
[1:28:01] heaven is is suffering of violence,
[1:28:04] which means the devil and all his demons
[1:28:07] are doing everything they can to try to
[1:28:09] stop God's people from entering in to
[1:28:12] Christ.
[1:28:16] In other words, if he can just get them
[1:28:18] satisfied with just coming to
[1:28:22] church, we're just going to say if I can
[1:28:24] just get them satisfied with coming to
[1:28:26] church and get them to think that
[1:28:28] they're actually pressing into the
[1:28:31] kingdom. Like if we we achieve that
[1:28:33] goal, we're pressing in because, you
[1:28:35] know, I I haven't been, you know, coming
[1:28:38] all the time. So, if I just if I just
[1:28:40] come, you know, this I I feel like I I
[1:28:42] I'm I'm I'm pressing in, but I'm telling
[1:28:45] you, the demons are trying to keep you
[1:28:47] away from becoming like Jesus. Amen.
[1:28:53] Brother B talked about a lot of times
[1:28:55] coming to church, the devil comes too.
[1:28:58] And what is he doing? He's trying to get
[1:29:00] you to doubt the word of God. He's
[1:29:03] trying to get you to doubt that what's
[1:29:04] being preached is exactly for you. Yes,
[1:29:07] that is right. that it's for the person
[1:29:09] sitting next to you. That's right.
[1:29:12] So, we're fighting against demons.
[1:29:16] Ephesians 6:12 says, "For we wrestle not
[1:29:18] against flesh and blood,
[1:29:21] but against principalities, against
[1:29:23] powers, against the rulers of the
[1:29:24] darkness of this world, against
[1:29:26] spiritual wickedness in high places."
[1:29:28] Now, the last time you had an argument
[1:29:32] with
[1:29:34] somebody, I'm pretty sure that you
[1:29:36] probably weren't thinking about that
[1:29:38] scripture.
[1:29:41] It wasn't until afterwards, maybe.
[1:29:44] But see, the person that you're having
[1:29:46] an argument
[1:29:54] with, you you that person is not the one
[1:30:00] that's trying to keep you out of the
[1:30:01] kingdom.
[1:30:02] It may be the devil that's anointing
[1:30:05] them at that moment, but you you you
[1:30:08] have to
[1:30:10] understand if we don't press, the
[1:30:13] devil's got a easy
[1:30:16] easy when's easy with
[1:30:20] us because they're working real hard to
[1:30:23] keep us from really putting our heart
[1:30:25] into God, putting our heart into the
[1:30:28] word, putting our heart into the
[1:30:30] services, putting our heart Well, I want
[1:30:32] to be like you, Jesus. I want to be more
[1:30:34] like you this year than I've ever been.
[1:30:36] I'm serious with you. I'm dedicating
[1:30:38] myself. I want to just put my whole
[1:30:41] heart into this. That's what the devil
[1:30:44] is trying to keep you from
[1:30:46] doing. So, if he can get you
[1:30:49] relaxed, just lukewarm, not hot, not
[1:30:53] cold, right here, lukewarm. If the devil
[1:30:57] can get you to do that, you know what
[1:31:00] the devil sits back and says, "You're so
[1:31:04] foolish. You don't even understand." But
[1:31:06] Jesus said, "I'm going to spew you out
[1:31:08] of my mouth."
[1:31:10] But we don't think like that. We think,
[1:31:13] "Well, at least at least I'm coming to
[1:31:15] church,
[1:31:18] you know. At least
[1:31:20] I at least I say amen to what the word
[1:31:23] is being said.
[1:31:25] At least I'm not, you know, being as,
[1:31:26] you know, stubborn as I used to be.
[1:31:30] And and here's the thing. We ought to be
[1:31:32] chasing after God. God, make me more
[1:31:35] hot. Get my heart on fire. Set my heart
[1:31:38] on fire. I want a relationship with you
[1:31:42] that actually the life is being lived in
[1:31:44] my home. That's where we need to be.
[1:31:48] We're fighting against spiritual
[1:31:49] wickedness in high places. I mean, it's
[1:31:51] all in our head. It's happening right
[1:31:54] here.
[1:31:56] If we have to fight against these
[1:31:58] demons, then we must be
[1:32:05] violent. Hopefully, nobody cuts in in
[1:32:08] the message at that
[1:32:10] point. But we need to get violent
[1:32:12] against these demons. We need to let
[1:32:14] them know what side we're on. I'm not
[1:32:16] going to, you know, let him talk me out
[1:32:19] of this.
[1:32:20] I I I I'm going to shine the light. I'm
[1:32:23] going to I'm going to love the
[1:32:24] unlovable.
[1:32:27] In order to take the kingdom by force,
[1:32:31] brother Brandham would say it like this.
[1:32:32] And I was not disobedient to the
[1:32:34] heavenly vision. He said, "Let's press
[1:32:36] into the unseen." He said, "Press into
[1:32:39] the unseen." In other words, I don't see
[1:32:42] the kingdom of God. It comes without
[1:32:43] observation, but let us press into it.
[1:32:47] The blessings, he said, are yours.
[1:32:50] They're for you. But what do you got to
[1:32:52] do? Press in to the kingdom. He said,
[1:32:55] seize the nature of God. Brother Brandon
[1:32:58] would say it like this in desperations.
[1:33:00] He said, you don't stand around and say,
[1:33:03] well, pick me up by the collar, Lord,
[1:33:06] and just push me
[1:33:07] in. He says, you press into it. You get
[1:33:11] desperate. It's between life and death.
[1:33:14] He
[1:33:15] said in the message, "Perseverant."
[1:33:17] Brother Brandon says, "We're living in
[1:33:19] the shadows of his coming. Whatever you
[1:33:21] do, press into the kingdom of God. If
[1:33:25] there is one little touch strikes your
[1:33:29] heart, you come quickly while you have
[1:33:32] the opportunity to come." Right?
[1:33:35] This is powerful. He says, "Cuz the hour
[1:33:38] is approaching when it will be too
[1:33:41] late." Yes, sir.
[1:33:43] Then you'll never want to come no more.
[1:33:48] There won't be any more call in the
[1:33:50] heart in your heart.
[1:33:52] And then no matter how much you did try,
[1:33:55] you would never get in. When the last
[1:33:58] member is added to the body for the
[1:34:01] rapture,
[1:34:02] he said there'll never be another one
[1:34:05] saved. The doors are closed as it was in
[1:34:09] the days of Noah. There will be no more
[1:34:11] salvation left. though people will think
[1:34:13] there there will be
[1:34:15] that's where the trouble is going to
[1:34:20] come. Amen. Let's stand together. Oh my
[1:34:24] my how I wish that we would just be able
[1:34:29] to have a little bit more time
[1:34:34] um to share and but I'm going to say
[1:34:37] part of this because it is it is rich
[1:34:41] and because we're we're always going to
[1:34:43] be in a battle, will we not? We're
[1:34:45] always going to be in a battle and we've
[1:34:46] got to we've got to conquer the devil in
[1:34:50] our minds. Amen. We've got to conquer
[1:34:53] the devil in our minds. Amen. Let's sing
[1:34:55] that little chorus. Um
[1:34:59] uh learning to lean. Learning to
[1:35:06] lean.
[1:35:08] Learning to
[1:35:11] lean. I'm
[1:35:13] learning to
[1:35:15] lean. I'm learning to leave. lean on
[1:35:22] [Music]
[1:35:24] Jesus
[1:35:26] gaining more
[1:35:28] power than I've ever
[1:35:32] seen. I'm learning to
[1:35:36] lean on
[1:35:41] Jesus. Oh,
[1:35:43] learning to lean.
[1:35:46] I'm
[1:35:47] learning to
[1:35:50] lean. Learning to lean on
[1:35:56] [Music]
[1:35:58] Jesus.
[1:35:59] Gaining more
[1:36:01] power than I've ever
[1:36:05] seen. I'm learning to
[1:36:09] lean on you. Amen. Let's sing it now as
[1:36:14] we make this commitment to a
[1:36:17] learning to
[1:36:19] lean. I'm
[1:36:21] learning to
[1:36:23] lean. I'm learning to lean on
[1:36:29] [Music]
[1:36:31] Jesus.
[1:36:33] Gaining more
[1:36:35] power I've ever seen.
[1:36:40] I'm learning to
[1:36:42] lean on
[1:36:44] [Music]
[1:36:48] Jesus. Amen. Let's go before the Lord in
[1:36:52] prayer. Amen. I I just say it like this
[1:36:55] with every head bowed, every eye closed.
[1:36:57] If it's in your
[1:36:58] heart, you really you truly truly want
[1:37:01] to leave here with a a a dedication and
[1:37:04] a
[1:37:05] determination. you want to consecrate
[1:37:08] yourself to start uh trusting in God
[1:37:11] more. I want you to believe that as we
[1:37:14] pray because I believe that's your
[1:37:16] desire, that's what you want, that's
[1:37:19] what's going to happen. Amen. Our
[1:37:21] heavenly father, we come to you as as
[1:37:24] your body of believers here.
[1:37:26] Lord, we thank you, Lord, that you're
[1:37:30] still there with your hands outstretched
[1:37:33] towards us, wanting to bless us so much.
[1:37:38] But because we haven't put more of our
[1:37:41] trust in you, it's kept the blessings
[1:37:43] from coming our way. And today, Lord, we
[1:37:47] want those blessings, oh God. We want
[1:37:49] those blessings. We want happiness. We
[1:37:52] want
[1:37:53] peace, Lord. We want the things that are
[1:37:56] company a man that trust in you. And
[1:37:59] Lord, our faith hasn't been to the place
[1:38:01] that we'd like it to be. That and our
[1:38:03] trust hasn't been to the place that we
[1:38:05] would like it to be. But here we are
[1:38:08] today making this uh this prayer to you.
[1:38:12] Uh that Lord uh we want our trust to
[1:38:15] grow. We want our our our confidence in
[1:38:18] you that you'll help us in the in the
[1:38:20] middle of our trials. And Lord, today
[1:38:23] Lord, we pray God that you would meet us
[1:38:26] in prayer when we would come to you in
[1:38:28] prayer and we would uh express to you.
[1:38:32] God, help me to trust you more. God,
[1:38:35] help me to to build my my faith in you
[1:38:37] and my my confidence in you that that
[1:38:40] you'll be with me today. And when a
[1:38:42] trial rises up, Lord, help remind me,
[1:38:45] Lord, a a as you brought uh to the to
[1:38:48] the memory of Jonah. Lord, may you bring
[1:38:50] it to our memory, Lord, that you are
[1:38:53] with us in the middle of our trials,
[1:38:56] God. That we could learn to lean upon
[1:38:58] you, learn to trust you, Father, that
[1:39:01] all of our faith could grow more and
[1:39:03] more because, Lord, we know it needs to
[1:39:06] get to a place where our faith is a
[1:39:08] rapturing faith to get out of here. I
[1:39:10] pray that you'd help us with the small
[1:39:13] things in our lives, Lord, just to to
[1:39:15] learn to trust you that you'll be with
[1:39:17] us. Bless your people. Give them, Lord,
[1:39:20] this confidence that you want to have.
[1:39:22] And I pray, oh God, that you pour out
[1:39:24] your blessings upon your people. Bless
[1:39:26] them for trusting you, Lord. May they
[1:39:29] feel the blessings happening. And Lord,
[1:39:32] all because they put their trust in you.
[1:39:34] And may it begin to just continue and to
[1:39:36] multiply and to grow. that Lord,
[1:39:39] happiness could grow and peace could
[1:39:41] grow and joy could grow and and just a
[1:39:44] freedom of being able to never be
[1:39:46] afraid, Lord, when fear would attack
[1:39:49] them, they would be able to stand there
[1:39:50] in confidence that Lord, uh, greater is
[1:39:54] he that's in us than he that's in the
[1:39:55] world. And I can do all things through
[1:39:57] Christ who strengthenth me. And these
[1:39:59] these scriptures can become so real to
[1:40:02] us, Lord. Grant, Father, we commit
[1:40:05] ourselves to you. We thank you for these
