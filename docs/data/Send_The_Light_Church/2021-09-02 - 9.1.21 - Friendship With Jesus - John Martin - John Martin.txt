real precious in his ears tonight just to be one with christ amen god bless you this evening turn with me if you would to the book of james chapter 2 as you're turning there this is our our first sister cheryl so let me give you that this is the first of september and i believe this will be the last month we're here in this in this place and we're getting more excited by the day um i want to thank brother ferguson who brought the men's meeting today he brought it with with power and uh provoked us encouraged us and inspired us to pray more and to get in the spirit when we pray and i really really appreciate it helped me very very much it was so good i wish everybody it would have been a wednesday and he could have just told everybody that's how how good it was amen amen let's pray for our brother i believe that he could be a great blessing to our church and just the more we get to know him and um we certainly appreciate his humble spirit amen amen god bless you brother before we begin reading here let's look to the author amen heavenly father we thank you for this time of worship that we've had and these great songs that exalt you and lift you up and lord we pray that you're pleased with our worship tonight lord that you desire to come down today and place the revelation of your word down in our hearts lord we need you to do that we're just a man we're capable of giving revelation one to another lord we could do our best to try to explain things but only you can come and make it real in our lives father we pray that you take this little subject these scriptures this time we want to dedicate it to you right now and pray that you'd come take control lord of our thoughts our mind oh lord we pray that you protect us from the enemy coming and placing any thoughts in our head but lord you just built a hedge of protection around this room today and father lord we just ask that the holy spirit would have the preeminence in the midst we commit now the service to you give you the praise and honor in jesus precious name we pray amen amen james chapter 2 we're just going to read verses 21 through 23 and have you be seated and the bible says was not abraham our father justified by works when he had offered isaac his son upon the altar see is thou how faith wrought with his works and by works was faith made perfect the scriptures and the scripture was fulfilled which saith abraham believed god and it was imputed unto him for righteousness and he was called the friend of god god bless you may be seated i want to say it's really a blessing from my heart to see brother larry here amen god bless you brother we want to entitle this message friendship friendship and for a subject god called me his friend and brother brandon was quoting brother bile's work a number of times and he said fellowship was like two fellows in one ship another place he said two fellows and one ship makes the fellowship i think friendship could be looked at in the same way it's two friends and one ship two friends in one ship the definition of friendship is the state of being friends the state of being friends so good to see sister kathleen amen god is capture amen we're going to continue to pray amen it is the state of being friends being friendly and express expressing of good will and kindness the definition of a friend is one that is fond or attached to another proverb 17 17 says a friend loveth at all times we could say a friend loveth at all times the dictionary also defines a friend as as one that is not hostile to another one that is not aggressive feeling or showing active opposition so i want to make some some statements here before we get into the scriptures you can be a friend to someone without having a friendship with them in other words you can be a friend to someone who is not friendly to you you can be friendly to someone who's actually hostile towards you you can be a friend to someone without there being a real friendship or being in the same boat together and since fred friendship is based on trust you could be a friend to someone without trusting them we know jesus the bible tells us was a friend to publicans and sinners jesus was not only a friend to those that agreed with him but he was a friend to his enemies jesus chose a man to be his disciple and he chose him for the ministry to be a church treasure but through the process of time judas began to think more about himself than jesus instead of a ministry that lived for others he began living for himself judas no longer wanted to help the ministry that jesus had called him to but he started looking at how he could profit from that ministry what he could get out of it and judas betrayed jesus a man that never did them wrong he betrayed him with a kiss and with pretense i want to pick it up in matthew chapter 26 verse 49. and forthwith he came to jesus judas did and said hail master and kissed him and look at the response here and jesus said unto him friend friend wherefore are thou come then came they and laid hands on jesus and took them jesus was a friend to those he knew were not a true friend to him and he remained friendly to those who used him to get personal gain jesus could still call them a friend just like he did judas because jesus remained friendly to him he didn't get aggressive or hostile to his own betrayer he opened out his mouth to show act of opposition he was genuinely the same towards those who turned against him this is powerful [Music] thank you brother i can see clearly now what does jesus want us to do he wants us to get in the same boat with him amen he wants us to have friendship with him in this manner this type of friendship the bible says in first peter chapter 2 verse 18 he says servants be subject to your masters with all fear not only to the good and gentle but also to the forward and that word just means crooked or or warped or perverse he wants us to be uh subject to them as well for this is thank worthy if a man for conscious towards god he endures grief suffering wrongfully now this is what was happening to jesus in this hour for what glory is that if when you're buffeted for your faults and you take it patiently in other words you should but if when you do well and suffer for it and suffer for it you take it patiently this is acceptable with god so this is the bolt that jesus is wanting us to get into to have friendship with him amen amen for even hearing too were you called this is what your jesus if i could say like this in verse 21 jesus is sitting in the boat and he's calling you to get in the boat with him for even or two were you called because christ also suffered for us leaving us an example that we should do the very same things he's doing who did no sin neither guile found in his mouth who when he was revived he rebound not again when he suffered he threatened not but he committed himself to him that judgeth righteously jesus was a friend to judas even though there wasn't much of a friendship between the two and even though jesus couldn't trust judas jesus still trusted his heavenly father in the middle of that situation he committed it to god he trusted in god and he was led as a lamb to the slaughter christ also suffered for us leaving us an example that we should follow his steps in other words be a friend back to jesus that's the steps he wants us to follow be a friend back to jesus by doing what he told us to do get in the boat with jesus be in fellowship with the same things that jesus believes now we can find lots of different things about the word that we want to believe but tonight let's take a look at what jesus is calling us to i want to be i want to be on the side where abraham was he was called the friend of god every believer views jesus as their friend they will testify of his faithfulness his mercy his love is long suffering the things that he's done from that he's a present help in a time of trouble that he's a friend that sticketh closer than the family but jesus is asking us to get in the same boat with him to have the same fellowship with him to follow his steps of unconditional love to be willing to suffer even if it's not your mistake to be a friend to those who are not a friend to you now the nature that we're born with was to be friends with those who we felt more comfortable with but when you become born again your nature puts you out as a friend to those who are not friends towards you that's why brother branham could enter the pulpit and say good morning friends from the bottom of his heart and he knew that there were people out there that didn't agree with him that weren't his friends that talked behind his back and used him just to get more people to come in his church he had so many reasons of being used but you know what he was still christ to the people yes he was and god has called us to be christ to the people around us people aren't going to see jesus unless they see him in you brother branham always drew a bigger circle around his enemies he followed jesus into the bolt that's what brother branham did he had fellowship and communion he had a real friendship with jesus amen matthew chapter 5 verse 43 and it's okay if you enjoy the word saying that amen it's so much easier to eat you know when when you're enjoying it i want to say thank you for your your prayers for us when we went up uh north we had a chance to eat at daryl's four times four times had pancakes three times i'm telling you i enjoyed it i enjoyed getting in that boat matthew chapter 5 verse 43 you have heard that had been said thou shalt love thy neighbor and hate thy enemy but i say unto you love your enemies bless them that curse you do good to them that hate you pray for them that despitefully use you and persecute now this is an extremely difficult thing to do but the holy ghost does it the holy ghost does not have a hard time doing this we in our flesh have our time but if you enter into the spirit yes god to fill you with his spirit there will not be any pressure there will not be any problems there will not be any issues that ye may be the children of your father which is in heaven in other words god is identifying his children by this one aspect for he may get the sun to rise and the evil and the good and sinners reign on the just and the just for he maketh in other words jesus is telling you you can make the sun rise on the evil and on the good you can you can because if you're a son or you're a daughter of god you're filled with your spirit and you can't do this just like god maketh the sun to rise i need you on the good so you do the same you got to believe it you can't wait till it happens and say oh wow i guess i could you've got to believe it before it happens no different than abraham amen god identifies his children as do-gooders genuinely caring burden uh authentic agape love expressors if i could say it like that they genuinely love everybody by this shall all men know that you're my children my disciples my children when you have love one for another's enemy anybody can love right for if you love them which love you what reward have you even the republicans the same and if you salute your brother and only what you more than others do not even republican soul god wants us to get out of that boat of just loving certain people it's a horrible boat it's the boat that we were kind of born with that's right but he wants us to get into his boat amen jesus wants us to get out of the so-called friendship and get into his type of friendship one that he's trying to get all of his children to do he said be therefore perfect even as your father which is in heaven is perfect or complete complete love you just completely love everybody now god will remain faithful to us no matter how unfaithful we are god will remain a faithful friend no matter how little we think of being a friend to him or even getting in his bowl we should never question god's loyalty or his love or his faithfulness towards us if you need a question question if you've gotten out of his boat his fellowship his friendship his word and his will because that's always where the mistake takes place now jesus warns the bible reader of many believers who didn't make it believers in god that didn't make it believers with faith believers that boldly use the name of jesus believers that worked for jesus believers that used the gifts that jesus gave them these believers could testify that jesus was a friend but jesus could never testify that they that they were his friend right it's true they weren't in the same boat they weren't the same fellowship or the same friendship with the will of god for their lives they weren't interested in laying aside everything else till they got perfect love they weren't willing to let anybody use them they didn't want to get in a situation of getting jews so they wouldn't even allow it and instead of praying with a burden they despised their enemies matthew chapter 7 verse 22 says many will say to me in that day lord lord have we not prophesied thy name and in thy name cast out devils and in thy name done many wonderful works and then i will profess unto them i never knew you depart from me that work iniquity so i want you to think about the friendship here jesus was a friend to them yeah you want to use my name go ahead you want to call me lord lord go ahead but in reality lord means lord of my life not just savior thanks for saving me but lord of my life i want to do your will and many are going to say lord lord they're saying lord lord without allowing god to be their lord so it doesn't matter what we say down here it matters if we take the time to live the life amen to let him be the lord of your life and prove it by laying down your life for your enemy amen to pray for them with a burden yes to let them use you and hoping that they might see christ someday that's what matters these were believers professing believers and look at their approach lord lord but not thinking about what it means when they sing he is lord jesus was a friend to them but there wasn't the friendship that they thought i want us to think about that because every one of us are in a relationship with jesus christ today and all these people that are going to hear uh depart from me i never knew you they're going to wish somebody stop them in their tracks just i wish somebody loved me enough to help me but it's going to be too late then matthew chapter 22 we don't got time to read the whole parable but there's about six scriptures six different things that were said in our men's meeting that were already in our notes and this was one of them our our brother brought out this is the parable of the king that made a wedding and a feast for his son we don't got time to read it all but i just want to pick it up at verse 11 and when the king came to see the guest he saw there was a man which had not a wedding garment and he said unto him friend think about this he calls him a friend how came is thou in hither not having a wedding garment and he was speechless and look what look what he said then said they came to a certain bind him now this is he's calling him friend he's telling him to bind him hand and foot and take him away and cast him into outer darkness and there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth for many are called but few are chosen he still called him a friend even though he snuck in some other way he didn't come god's provided way and he didn't get the garment of god's righteousness on right he still called him a friend think about that he caught judas a friend right up to the very end it doesn't matter what he calls me it only matters if i'm a true friend to him another scripture that was read in our men's meaning john chapter 10 verse 8 all that ever came before me are thieves and robbers all that ever came before me are thieves and robbers but the sheep did not hear them believers in jesus but not really wanting to be his friend that's what that is it's true they believe that he has the words of eternal life he's the only way he can get there but they want to steal it they don't want to buy it of course you can't buy it with money we're going to read some quotes on that you can't buy it with works you got to buy it without money without price you got to come and give your heart you got to get in the boat with jesus all that ever came before me are one-sided relationships one-sided friendships when we want god's help and don't want his will is really wanting a one-sided relationship a one-sided friendship i want god to meet all my needs but i don't want to pay my tithes for the ministry and my offerings for the church another scripture that was brought out about us robbing god of our time malachi chapter 3 verse 8 will a man rob god yet you rob me all that ever came before me with thieves and robbers yet ye have robbed me but ye say wherein did we rob thee never never i never walked in a church and grabbed anything he says you robbed me in tithes and offerings notice they're separated amen he said you're cursed with a curse for you robbed me so here we didn't take nothing from the church but because we didn't bring what already belonged to him we get cursed now this is god that's right he said bring and even said even this whole nation even this whole nation for you romney even this whole nation bring ye all the tithes into the storehouse that ye may that there may be meat notice this is for the ministry that there may be meat in my house and prove me now herewith saith the lord of hosts if i will not open you the windows of heaven and pour you out a blessing that there shall not be room enough to receive it god's word is true yes when god tells us to do something and we don't care enough to do it we're actually robbing god of his will so we can read problem of our time the tithes but also rob him of doing his will and there will come a time that every one of us is going to have a need of god in her life and it's at that hour that we're going to really want to have a friendship with jesus in the message trying to do god's service without being the will of god brother brahm said god bless these faithful men too in a time of emergency that's the time to look to god and to look to him and to be on friendship with him before the emergency arrives we know this if we have favor with god we can ask him anything like you would any other friend he is a present help in a time of trouble i'd rather be surrounded by friends and enemies unfortunately the friends are getting less and less and the enemies are getting greater and greater genuine friendship cannot be bought too many people have tried to buy friendship with jesus buy friendship with jesus would be robbing him of what he really wants and that's our hearts and i think many will come to me in that day and saying lord lord thinking that these things that they did was good enough to buy it you understand not so much the money of course i'm sure there are people that say as long as i pay my tithe i'm in well i belong to a church one time that believed in buying forgiveness i didn't even know this message existed at the time it was indulgence indulgence was issued by the pope it came with a complete remission of sins allowing escape from all of the pains of purgatory now it stopped in 1567 but i don't know if we know this but pope john paul ii brought it back in the year 2000 according to church teaching even after sinners are absolved in the confessional and say their our fathers and hail mary's as penance they still face punishment after death in purgatory before they can enter into heaven you can just read this on on the internet that's where i got it from in exchange for certain prayers devotions or pilgrimages in special years a catholic can receive an indulgence which reduces or erases that punishment instantly with no formal ceremony or sacrament there are partial indulgence which reduce purgatorial time by a certain number of days or years and plenary indulgence which eliminates all of it until another sin is committed you can get one for yourself or for someone who is dead you cannot buy one the church outlawed that sale of indulgence in 1567 but same sentence but charitable contributions combined with other acts can help you earn one now this is this is a limit of one per preliminary indulgence per center per day but look when i was caught up in that and there's whether it's that denomination or other denominations you know if you just do this you just put your name on the book you just speak in tongues you just join our church whatever it is you can't buy friendship with jesus true friendship cannot be bought proverbs chapter 14 verse 20 the poor is hated even of his own neighbor but the rich have many friends and as soon as the riches stop your friends go bye-bye like you really find out who your friends were in the message the day this scripture is fulfilled brother brahman says look at our nation once the flower of the earth our great democracy was formed back there at the declaration of independence and a declaration of independence was signed and we had our democracy and our great forefathers and the things that they've done we had a great nation but she is now rottening she's crumbling shaking and giving way and trying to tax people to get money to send over yonder to buy friendship with their enemies and they're throwing it back in her face one world war two world war and still moving on to the third one certainly politics is rotten corrupted rotten to the bottom just exactly what matthew 24 said it would be nation would rise against nation kingdom against kingdom and all these things would take place he said let's consider this now all right in the message influences brother branham says why it's become a stench in the nostrils all the overseas money and lease loans and everything like that will never buy friendship what we need in this nation he said we'll never have it but what we need is a house cleaning time not a political house cleaning but a holy ghost sent revival that will sweep her from the tip to the toe that's what our churches need that's what our people needs that's what as individuals we need now we can't change the world but we can't change ourself when we change ourselves will change the church when we change the church we'll be a better influence to the community but it starts with us now we can't buy favor or friendship with god we know that but where most believers get caught up is mixing relationships right part with god and part with the world that is exactly what they did in matthew chapter seven one man you'll come to me and say lord didn't i do this and this and this well why don't they just come and say yeah but i was mixed in the world and i did what i wanted to do and i did these other things why didn't they say that because the reason that jesus said they couldn't come in was because of the other things it wasn't because of casting out devils or doing wonderful works for jesus is what they weren't doing right when they were doing that and that's why it's important to have a ministry that talks about the things that we're not doing amen amen james chapter four verse four ye adulterers and adulteresses now this is speaking spiritually know ye not that the friendship of the world is enmity with god whosoever therefore be a friend of the world is a friend is an enemy of god no god will still call you fred but he knows you're not being a friend to him right it's true because you have to come out of her you have to be separate and and you know we're in the world jesus said we have to go to work right we have to take care of things but we're not of the world and jesus prayed for us before he left that god would keep us the father would keep us from the world amen and that we would grow in our oneness with god not just oh we're already one no we're not too many things happen in my life that prove i'm not one with god there's room for growth and that's what our focus that's why we're here right there's an invisible union taking place do you think the scripture do you think that the scripture saith in vain the spirit that dwelleth in us it lusteth to envy but he giveth more grace wherefore he said god resist the proud giveth grace to the humble submit yourselves therefore to god resist the devil and he will flee from you so friendship with god comes from submission to god in the message the seed of discrepancy brother branham said judas only played church he wasn't really sincere he didn't actually have faith he or else he would have never betrayed jesus but see he showed the seed of discrepancy he thought that he could make friends with the world mammon and also have friendship with jesus think about it and thought that he would make himself a piece of money and would be popular among the people if that doesn't cause so many people to get in discrepancy trying to find favor with man brother man says let's find favor with god not man amen that's right the problem is everybody thinks they already got favor with god by his grace we're here but i can tell you by his grace i'm not there and i need grace to get there i mean grace that i can see that i'm not there that i can press towards that mark too often we bring the world with us when we come to church things hanging all over us wanting to talk about things we find ourselves trying to build favor with one another instead of building it with god trying to stand out among one another instead of setting our affections on god brother braham says we go to church to find out where we stand with god amen i want you to think about what happens when you're thinking about going to church i mean some of us are struggling honestly to put in their heart to want to be here that's right it's true but god uses the ministry to bring out where we're standing with him he uses the ministry to do that where we're at on the scale of our friendship with god not to find out if god has been faithful in the relationship we know he's been faithful in the relationship but to find out where our faithfulness has been in the message the church ordered brother braham said but the church is not a general meeting house for fellowship and friendship and frolic it's not for fellowship and it's not for friendship right and it's not for folly frolic means to have fun to have a playful behavior or to be light spirited it's not this is not for that any of that our focus needs to be on god and i i know we don't see one another enough but why would you give up god for that right right that's what you're doing when you're trying to find favor with one another and trying to look like something or fellowship with somebody we're not here for that purpose brother ben said the church is a sanctuary of god now if you want to meet one another let me come to your house right you come to my house you go to one another's house and meet one another but just to frolic around through church and talking and things like that i'm glad he said that it's not right brother we come here and we get the whole thing out of our mind it's like we need to come into church with blinders i want to prepare my heart i want to receive for you i got to find out where i'm staying with you lord i want more of you judas didn't take the ministry serious enough you know when you're fellowshipping frolicking around or just trying to build friendship it's taking you away from the seriousness of the ministry it really really is and it happens so subtle that before you know it we just come in here you know brother bam talks you know god isn't into dancing right i mean i believe in dancing in the spirit but it ain't about us in our show and we i believe that we miss god in simplicity because we're not taking them serious enough we're missing god in the ministry and that's why i believe the lord brought the realness of god in and god is really among us if we could just recognize it i say send the light church we have some maturity to do in our church this church and our new church will not be a general meeting house for fellowship for friendship or frolic we need to spend more time laying in the presence of the son we need to come to church with a spiritual purpose in our mind a spiritual purpose for a life brother i'm sending the message from that time he says and you men let your wives go out like that shame on you the matter ain't uh the matter ain't you got no more respect for your wife than that now no i don't want to get into that notice that's a bad thing for me i lose too many friends when i talk like that but i know that i'm staying in friendship with christ because it's written right here that's exactly right now i understand that these things that i'm saying isn't popular and i know i'm not going to get maybe a close friendship with somebody but if somebody loves the word the way they should there's not going to be any problem with friendship the way of a true prophet of god brother branson says but the word of god will endure forever upon this rock i'll build my hopes forever upon the word of the lord let everything else sink if i lose friend everything else my friendship is in christ he says if i lose every friend and everything else my friendship is in christ that's the way we need to feel when we come to church hey i know you want to talk i know you must not you know be perhaps where you you ought to be but for me i need to go seek the lord amen i'm here about making our church better i'm here about getting serious about bringing the presence of god down and yes i'm serious about growing amen luke 21 verse 13. luke 21 13 you're going to have people come against you he said here and it shall turn to you for a testimony he said settle it therefore in your hearts not to meditate before what you shall answer for i will give you a mouth and wisdom which all your adversaries shall not be able to gain say nor resist and you shall be betrayed just like jesus was both by parents by brethren by kin folks and friends and some of you shall they cause to put to death he said settle it settle it in your heart don't let that move you and ye shall be hated of all men for my name's sake but there shall not a hair of your head perish i'm so glad he's taking care of me we gotta do one thing just stand for jesus stand for the word amen in the message from that time i want to talk about another type of friendship here he says but let me tell you a little secret the most powerful force in the world isn't speaking with tongues or interpreting in tongues or being honored by god to be a minister or to be an evangelist or to be a prophet he said the most powerful weapon that i've ever found in my life is love the filial love which the greek word comes from friendship like you have for your wife there's a difference it'll make a mother for that baby run into a blazing fire her life means nothing he said that's filial love what will agape do the godly love he says we must love divine love one another divinely love one another he says then you don't see your brother's mistake even though the devil comes and goes like this get by me satan divine love does that yes if he does make a mistake you look over the top of it and you love him anyhow see that's it and he quotes jesus if you love those that love you then doesn't the sin are the same thing the sinner does the same thing he says but love those who doesn't love you you know what we're scared half the time to talk to somebody who don't love us that's true we're scared we're going to get hurt love is powerful it is the most powerful force agape love i'd just say we need to get in the same boat with jesus that's where he's at real friendship he said but love those that doesn't love you he said that's what shows the spirit of god is in you that's what shows the spirit of god in you because he loved you when you were his enemy and he loved you and the spirit's in you it'll make you love your enemy as you do your friend oh to me this is powerful this is rich this is what i hunger for th this is what i long for in my life i want to lay everything aside for more of this in other words god is going to do the same thing in you and through you that he did outside of you somebody you saw somebody love you you saw somebody love you when you didn't deserve it doesn't that put you in debt to go love somebody that doesn't deserve it in your eyes in the message the unchanging word of god brother ram says you know i wish people loved one another again like they like that don't you oh my they're cold aren't they yes just as cold as a wart on a pickle he says i never seen anything in my life like it oh it's terrible nobody has any more friendship jesus did say because iniquity would abound the love of many would wax cold that's the hour that we're living in in this world that is abound in iniquity where love has become paper-thin storefront come on and hate is seen everywhere the holy spirit inside of us is still the same today it still can love beyond that it can still love the unlovable i'll just say it like this god said to abraham is anything too hard for the lord is it too hard for the lord to love through you no not if you just let them yeah not if you just die out to how great you are and the pride and the things that are standing in the way from reducing yourself to love he said i'll be with you even in you to the end doing what loving your enemies we are becoming one with god through the power of the holy spirit how many want to be friends a friend to jesus you know friends help others brother mike was telling me about his son that came to him or in the men's meeting that he came to him as a father and just i dad i want this and brother mike said well what are you going to do for me and i thought well i wonder if jesus asked that question to us when we come to him what will you do for me because friends help one another john chapter 15 verse 10. are you getting something out of this jesus said in john 15 verse 10 if you if you keep my commandments you shall abide in my love even as i kept my father's commandments and abide in his love now there's a lot of commandments but the one that christ is bringing us to is to be able to love like he loves that's the one he's bringing us to that's where you love your enemies you bless them that curse you you do good unto them that that use you you pray for them i'll tell you there should be something inside the believer that's not afraid not afraid of of what happens when you're in the presence of your enemy these things have i spoken unto you that my joy might remain with you and that your joy might be full i want my joy full i don't want a little bit i hate to say it but the joy the lord is my strength and i want more amen i want to be so full of joy this is my commandment that you love one another as i have loved you that's a big stipulation to love like he loved the only way that could ever happen is him loving through me because i can't manufacture it i can't do it i tried in the world having these relationships well if if you're this way if you're nice if you agree with me we're going to get the same boat but to get in the boat with jesus here we've got to love like he loved us that's the bone of fellowship he's calling us to get in that's right and i'll tell you it's not easy you gotta let go of your hate you've got to let go of your differences you got to let go of your starchy self-righteousness you got to let go of everything and be able to look beyond and love like god loves how many wants to be a friend to jesus a friend to jesus he said in verse 14. oh no verse 11. sorry sorry these things have i spoken unto you i'm so sorry where am i at verse 12. thank you thanks somebody's paying attention praise the lord this is my commandment that you love one others i have loved you greater love have no man than this then a man lay down his life for his friends now notice he's using friends so at this time this is not brother mark and brother marty and sister tricia no this is the person out there who has used me who has hurt me who has stabbed me in the back that's my friend that's my friend i just draw a bigger circle i lay down my life for my friends because jesus call judas a friend amen he's asking us to get in the same boat now ye are my friend jesus said ye are my friends if you do whatsoever i commanded you wow now we're we're taking that that friendship a little bit higher it's no longer i died for you now i'm calling you to get in the boat with me let's have some real fellowship two friends on the same page that agree with the same thing going in the same direction brother brad said if he could just get one man in his hand in the same boat going the same direction a lot of times we want to go that one way jesus wants us to go the other way right that's true you each got one ore and you're going in a circle get nowhere right here my friends if you do whatsoever i command you henceforth i call you not servants for the servant not know what is lord do it but i have called you friends for all things that i have heard of my father i have made known unto you this is beautiful if you really want the revelation of this word if you want it to be opened to you it comes with a cost you got to get in the boat revelation he's the doorkeeper it comes from him we either take the time to say lord i want to follow everything you got i'm serious i want to i want to know you more or we're going to do what the majority of the church world does i know god enough he saved me i really love how our brother ferguson brought out some rich things some very rich things yes he says you have not chosen me but i've chosen you and ordained you that you should go forth and bring forth fruit and that your fruit should remain and and whatsoever you shall ask of the father in my name he will give it to you these things i command you that you love one another now what is the fruit what is the fruit i've chosen you and i've ordained you to bring forth fruit now what fruit is he talking about well we know jesus said you shall know them by their fruits right it's not so much what clothes you're wearing right it's not being in sheep's clothing it's really being able to love your enemy and lay down your life for your enemy that's the fruit now he says i've ordained you to bring forth that fruit don't stay where we're at but press towards that and then he says once you get it let it remain don't just say i did it one time let it remain keep because as soon as you start really loving one enemy you'll have more strength to love another that's true you know you just build off of it zechariah 13 verse 6 and one shall say unto him this is when we get on the other side what are these wounds in thine hands then he shall answer those which those with which i was wounded in the house of my friends aren't you glad he didn't cut you off i feel it was me hammering amen it was for me he died it was for my sins but how many times when christ came to us before we surrendered we said no brother brandon says they're crucifying the lord afresh thank god for his love for his mercy and i want to say it today i want to thank god for the holy ghost that it can actually live in a human being and produce the same thing today because he is the same yesterday today and forever we just got to get excited about that we got to keep keep going in that direction and not stay content with what we have yes now if you want god to call you his friend you need to get in the boat with him because there's a difference between god calling you friend and being his friend you got to be in fellowship with his language do what he says love like he loves if you want to be closer to god if you want a closer friendship with god i want to say this start spending more time with with him in prayer and this is so beautiful because that's what our brother spoke on was prayer in our men's meeting draw an eye to god like enoch did just keep walking with him closer and closer with an expectation something's going to happen if not you're just going to go right back out in the world that's true wandering in the wilderness waiting for walk with him walk closer to his word set your affections upon him store up some treasures in heaven get away from the earth amen luke chapter 11 verse 2 we have to hurry because time is getting away luke and we're talking about how to get our friendship stronger with christ we want to end with this thought and he said unto them when ye pray say our father which art in heaven hallowed be thy name thy kingdom come thy will be done as it as in heaven so in earth what do you think brother ferguson [Laughter] these notes are already there give us daily give us day by day our daily bread brother ferguson really brought out thy will be done as in heaven so in earth that we are the earth it's we want god's we we want the whole the only way the will of god's going to be done in our life is we get filled with more of god's spirit amen it will carry out his will forgive us of our sins for we also forgive everyone that is indebted to us and lead us not to temptation but deliver us from evil and he says which of you shall have a friend and shall go on to him at midnight and saying friend i need three loaves of bread for a friend of mine in his journey has come to me and i have nothing to set before him and he from within he won't say it allowed but from within shall answer and say oh troubling not the door shut i'm with my children in bed i cannot rise and give it to you it's crazy you're calling me at midnight i say unto you though he will not rise and give him because he is a friend yet because of his in poor tunity the urgency he will rise and give him as many as he needeth why because it's his friend if you're a friend of jesus you don't have any problem laying down your life they will help somebody because jesus can't help them outside of a vessel i mean god could sit back and have his bride do nothing and just get all the predestined in and but that's not how he functions he uses us and what an honor to let god use our vessels to bring somebody in to help somebody to get them closer to open their eyes he told paul i've called you to open the eyes of them that are blind there is a part that paul played and we have a part to play don't be dismayed because somebody can't see the truth lay down your life for them well they're just going to step on me that's okay because they may see it eventually and you will never regret it but you will regret if you don't let them oh i love these scriptures and i say unto you verse 9 ask now he's bringing it back to us it's no different than a friend because jesus is a real friend to us he says ask and it shall be given you seek and you shall find knock and it shall be open unto you he's a real friend but we got to do our part we can't just sit there and say lazily i need you lord help me no we gotta humble herself come knock on the door just like this man did he's sleeping maybe he didn't come the first time maybe he was fast asleep kind of woken up whoa we've got to be willing to call on god like it's okay if you don't come right this second i'm still going to keep asking i'm still going to keep knocking i'm still going to keep seeking him because he's a friend that's sticking closer than a brother he's going to help me for everyone that asketh receive it isn't that wonderful what a promise what a promise well he didn't give it to me did you stop seeking did you stop asking you got to keep doing it everyone that asketh receive it and he that seeketh findeth and he that knocketh it shall be open if a son shall ask bread of any of you that is a father will he give him a stone or if he ask a fish well for a fish give him a serpent or for or if he shall ask an egg will he offer him a scorpion if he then be an evil yes he nailed it he nailed it if then he be if ye then be an evil know how to give good gifts to your children how much more shall your heavenly father give the holy spirit to them that ask him now we were praying with our brother ferguson and he was teaching us to pray oh i loved it i loved it i loved it i loved it we i i just loved it so much because there's nothing inhibiting i need to be taught i want to be inspire i want to pray and i'll better for more holy spirit amen i don't think i can get too much i don't think i'll get too much for i'll think i'm so good i don't have to be here i'm so good enough to come to church no more i don't think it's going to be like that i think the more i'm going to see i need to be here the more i long to be here the more of the holy ghost a believer has the more he will manifest perfect love and that's really the end game i know that i can't do it myself and all i can do it was his help and the help is me get out of the way so he can get in the way amen i know the more the holy ghost i get the less hostile i'll be the more i i the more i'll be inclined to be in meek humble gentle sounds like the fruit of the spirit won't have to worry i always remember what brother johnson used to say you don't ever have to worry about a praying man he won't hurt you if a man is really praying in the spirit he won't hurt you and this is the place we all should long to get to just look in the the course of the last week what you said what you done what you thought i want to pray more and i believe the holy ghost wants us to pray more you like god to call you his friend not just call you friend but call you his friend like he did abraham friends help one another they love at all times help jesus as much as you want him to help you amen get in the boat with him get in fellowship with him not just what you want but take what the ministry is giving you as from christ that's it take what the ministry is saying to you as from christ get serious with the word get serious with the fivefold ministry god can use anybody to speak to us but he's chosen this place that we've dedicated to him let him minister and then take that word and begin to as our brother said apply it amen begin to apply it just put it in your life just start with this one thing sometimes there's so much being said in the service i know crazy 12 pages can't even do them all i don't know why i do it i never get to them but just take one thing that god has spoke to your heart and get serious with it start applying it god can bless your life let's stand together abraham got in the same boat with jesus with god he was a friend of god praise
