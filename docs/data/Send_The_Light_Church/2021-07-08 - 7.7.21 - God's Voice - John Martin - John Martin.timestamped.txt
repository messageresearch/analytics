[19:57] afternoon amen
[19:59] i pray that it increases your faith to
[20:01] to know that these prayers will be
[20:03] answered
[20:04] amen that we have because
[20:07] we ask a miss sometimes we're out of out
[20:10] of faith amen
[20:11] but we just believe god's here to meet
[20:13] the needs tonight amen
[20:15] let's just have a prayer request for our
[20:18] our dear sister trish and brother roger
[20:20] that god would uh be their portion in
[20:23] this time of need
[20:25] amen we don't understand god
[20:29] we're not supposed to just to trust in
[20:31] him and obey him
[20:34] sometimes that seems hard but when you
[20:37] realize that he's the creator of heaven
[20:39] and earth in
[20:40] all things and he called us out of the
[20:42] light that we were living into the
[20:43] glorious light of the gospel
[20:46] all these are possible amen
[20:50] also for our brother uh samson uh shitty
[20:53] cousin has lung cancer needs a healing
[20:56] miracle
[20:57] in mind so we just pray especially over
[20:59] there i'm sure the
[21:01] hospitals aren't what they are over here
[21:04] so we just prayed for
[21:05] god's hand to fall upon amen also
[21:08] our sister amanda's friend
[21:13] joanna she lost her husband some years
[21:15] ago and
[21:16] still dealing with the loss that
[21:19] she could just look to christ for that
[21:23] comfort amen i
[21:27] can't find comfort in this world we've
[21:30] got love to cheese
[21:31] for that comfort and we just pray that
[21:33] our sister can help her in that quest
[21:35] amen
[21:36] also for uh our neighbors
[21:40] bob and freda just to be christ to them
[21:44] as they get older
[21:47] and now we can just
[21:52] you know you know sometimes it seems
[21:56] like you know the scripture says you
[21:59] know just to give
[22:00] a cold glass of water in the name of the
[22:02] lord
[22:05] you know just do whatever sometimes you
[22:08] can only do what you can
[22:16] you know just because you know somebody
[22:19] don't
[22:20] just because somebody doesn't accept the
[22:22] gospel
[22:24] even like some of our children sometimes
[22:26] they don't accept the gospel right
[22:28] you don't turn your back on him
[22:34] so god didn't turn his back on
[22:38] us
[22:43] so let's keep praying for all our lost
[22:45] ones
[22:46] amen i'm sure that every household has
[22:50] a represent representation of that amen
[22:53] in some way
[22:54] or form you know if they own their house
[22:56] praise the lord
[22:58] there's always a neighbor didn't even
[22:59] next door
[23:01] so let's just remember that let's just
[23:04] uh
[23:04] remember all the missionaries throughout
[23:06] the world
[23:08] amen also let's keep in mind all those
[23:11] people that lost a loved one down in
[23:13] florida and that
[23:15] got collapsed and that condo collapsed a
[23:18] moon

[23:49] in god's glorious kingdom and all those
[23:52] that
[23:53] we so have to enter in amen
[23:56] it's just if there's a
[23:59] silent need before us give it to the
[24:02] lord today if anybody needs a healing
[24:05] hand just
[24:06] accept it from christ this afternoon

[32:31] very provoking amen to good works that
[32:35] is
[32:36] amen well we want to have a little bible
[32:39] study tonight on god's voice
[32:42] god's voice and we're just going to read
[32:45] a few verses here
[32:47] starting with verse number one
[32:53] jesus speaking verily verily i say unto
[32:55] you he that enterth not
[32:57] by the door into the sheepfold but
[33:00] climbeth up some other way
[33:02] the same is a thief
[33:05] and a robber but he then entereth into
[33:08] the door
[33:09] by the door is the shepherd of the sheep
[33:13] to him the porter openeth and the sheep
[33:15] hear his voice
[33:17] and he calleth his own sheep by name
[33:20] and he leadeth them out and when he put
[33:23] them
[33:23] forth his own sheep he goeth before them
[33:27] and the sheep follow him and they know
[33:30] his
[33:31] voice amen god bless you may be seated i
[33:35] want
[33:35] have to stand for all these scriptures
[33:38] here
[33:44] but
[33:47] i want to continue reading all 29
[33:51] verses here maybe we could just have one
[33:53] more
[33:54] word of prayer amen heavenly father lord
[33:57] as we come before you
[33:58] once again lord we ask you to take these
[34:02] thoughts that you've laid on our heart
[34:04] today
[34:05] lord these scriptures that we will be
[34:08] digging into
[34:09] that you would help us to recognize your
[34:12] voice
[34:13] a little bit more clear that's our
[34:15] motive and our objective
[34:16] we pray that you'd come and bring the
[34:18] increase now and give us revelation of
[34:20] your word we pray
[34:21] in jesus name amen amen i want to
[34:25] continue to read this
[34:26] and a stranger will they not follow but
[34:31] will flee from him for they know not the
[34:33] voice
[34:34] of strangers this parable spake jesus
[34:38] unto them but they understood not what
[34:41] things
[34:42] they were which he spake unto them
[34:45] then said jesus unto them verily verily
[34:47] i say unto you i am the door of the
[34:49] sheep
[34:50] all that ever came before me are thieves
[34:52] and robbers but the sheep did not hear
[34:54] them
[34:56] i am the door by me if any man
[34:59] enter in he shall be saved and shall go
[35:02] in and out and find pasture
[35:04] the thief cometh not but to steal and to
[35:06] kill and to destroy
[35:07] i am come that they might have life and
[35:09] that they might have it more abundantly
[35:12] i am the good shepherd the good shepherd
[35:14] giveth his life for the sheep
[35:16] but he that is a hireling
[35:19] but he that is a hireling and not the
[35:21] shepherd
[35:22] whose own the sheep are not seeth the
[35:25] wolf coming
[35:26] leaveth the sheep and fleeth and the
[35:28] wolf catcheth them and scattereth the
[35:30] sheep
[35:31] the hireling fleeth because he is a
[35:33] hireling and careth not for the sheep
[35:35] i am the good shepherd and know my sheep
[35:37] and i am known
[35:39] of mine as the father knoweth me even so
[35:43] no i the father and i lay down my life
[35:46] for the sheep
[35:47] and other sheep i have which are not of
[35:49] this fold
[35:50] them also i must bring and they shall
[35:52] hear my voice
[35:54] and there and there shall be
[35:58] one foe and one shepherd therefore doth
[36:00] my father love me because i lay down
[36:02] my life that i might take it up again
[36:04] and no man taketh it from me but i lay
[36:06] it down of myself i have
[36:08] power to lie it down i have power to
[36:10] take it again
[36:11] this commandment that i received of my
[36:13] father
[36:15] there was
[36:18] divisions therefore among the jews for
[36:22] the same
[36:23] many of them said he have a devil and is
[36:27] mad
[36:28] why hear him and others they are not the
[36:30] words of him that
[36:31] have a devil can the devil open the eyes
[36:33] of the blind now notice there's lots of
[36:36] one voices being spoken but it's being
[36:38] perceived
[36:39] in different ways and it was at
[36:42] jerusalem that the feast of the
[36:43] dedication was a
[36:45] winner and jesus walked into the temple
[36:47] in solomon's porch and
[36:49] then came the jews round about him and
[36:50] said to him how long does that make us
[36:52] to doubt if thou
[36:54] be the christ tell us plainly and jesus
[36:56] answered i've told you
[36:58] and you believe that
[37:01] the works that i do in my father's name
[37:04] they bear witness of me but you believe
[37:05] not because you're not
[37:07] i'm a sheep ye are not of my sheep as i
[37:11] said unto you my sheep
[37:12] hear my voice and i know them and they
[37:15] follow me
[37:17] i give unto them eternal life and they
[37:18] shall never perish
[37:21] shoney man plucked them out of my hand
[37:24] my father
[37:25] which gave them me is greater than all
[37:28] and no man is able to pluck them out of
[37:30] my father's hand
[37:32] amen i want to stop right there i know i
[37:35] read those kind of
[37:36] fast but i got a lot of stuff i want to
[37:38] talk about today
[37:40] i want to get um
[37:43] just a lot of voices in the land
[37:47] there's so much confusion in the world
[37:48] today
[37:50] and it's getting worse and worse the
[37:52] confusion is getting greater and greater
[37:55] it's a non-stop uh everybody's got a
[37:58] voice
[38:00] they want to be heard and it doesn't
[38:03] matter if it's right or wrong
[38:06] i thought the world was insane before
[38:12] we're taught that the physical realm
[38:14] types
[38:15] the spiritual realm and there's so many
[38:18] voices
[38:19] even in the spiritual realm
[38:22] maybe we don't always discern or
[38:25] recognize
[38:25] each of them but these voices all stem
[38:29] from two trees it's either the power
[38:34] of god or the power of satan
[38:40] even though there's lots of voices lots
[38:41] of things lots of opinions lots of stuff
[38:43] going on
[38:44] the the sources of what voices that
[38:47] we're hearing are coming
[38:49] from one or two sources now we know that
[38:50] god is not the author of confusion
[38:55] his voice is one voice it will never
[38:58] contradict this word
[39:02] now if i don't say everything that i
[39:04] want to say because i don't think i'm
[39:05] going to be able to i want to say this
[39:09] we always refer to the voice of god as
[39:13] something we just heard something that
[39:16] just kind of
[39:17] spoke to me
[39:21] and we put emphasis on that
[39:26] that little thing that he spoke
[39:31] and i'm not against that at all
[39:35] but we have put such little emphasis
[39:38] on this right here
[39:42] this needs to become the greater
[39:44] emphasis
[39:46] because we know that this voice is
[39:48] correct
[39:49] this voice that i hear over here may or
[39:52] may not now
[39:53] just be honest with you how many times
[39:55] have you heard something
[39:56] you thought it was god speaking to you
[39:59] but you found out later that it wasn't
[40:03] many many many many times
[40:06] all of us but why
[40:10] have we put so little emphasis
[40:13] and i should learn from that
[40:20] now i believe that god
[40:23] the voice that that we ought to be
[40:27] following is this voice
[40:31] there's so much in here i can't keep up
[40:33] with it
[40:36] but this doesn't seem to interest us as
[40:38] much as
[40:41] you follow what i'm saying now god wants
[40:45] us to be faithful to this
[40:47] more than anything this what will bring
[40:50] us through
[40:50] this other stuff that that isn't here
[40:54] well there's a way to handle that
[40:58] there's a way to handle that just like
[40:59] all dreams all prophecies
[41:02] are handled the prophet taught us that
[41:04] god interprets his word
[41:06] by bringing it to past now this word
[41:09] must become manifested inside of me
[41:12] the voice of god is speaking to us
[41:15] to manifest this word that's what's
[41:17] important to god
[41:20] there ain't nothing more the devil would
[41:22] like to to get us to do to confuse us
[41:24] just like we read in the scripture today
[41:27] there was always a division when jesus
[41:29] spoke
[41:30] well it wasn't what jesus was saying
[41:33] amen
[41:34] it was what those voices were telling
[41:37] all those people when jesus was saying
[41:38] it
[41:39] right that's where the confusion came it
[41:42] was the other voices
[41:44] because god's voice is ya and amen it's
[41:46] one voice
[41:47] it's the word of god it can't change it
[41:50] can't move
[41:53] and i understand the the the time you
[41:57] know there's things that god has spoke
[41:58] to me and it has come to pass
[42:00] there's things that i thought god spoke
[42:02] to me that did not come to pass
[42:07] and the voices are so close
[42:10] i don't believe god expects me to stand
[42:13] here
[42:14] and make a decision whether what he
[42:16] spoke was
[42:17] him or not if it's him
[42:20] he'll bring it to pass if it's not it
[42:23] won't come to pass
[42:25] now this is so important that we focus
[42:29] on getting more of god's voice from the
[42:31] word of god brother brandon made it real
[42:32] clear
[42:34] now if i told you god spoke to me and he
[42:37] told me these five things are going to
[42:38] happen
[42:38] you would think i was spiritual right
[42:41] right
[42:42] a lot of people go they go for that but
[42:45] understand this brother brent says if
[42:46] you want to be more spiritual
[42:48] read your bible and pray because this is
[42:52] the voice of god
[42:54] stay with that that's how you become
[42:57] spiritual
[43:04] jesus is the door
[43:07] that opens eternal life everybody wants
[43:11] to
[43:11] live forever he said i come that i might
[43:14] have i i come that they may have life
[43:17] and that they may have it more
[43:19] abundantly
[43:20] jesus is the door he's the way he's the
[43:23] truth
[43:24] he's the life and no man can come unto
[43:27] the father but by him
[43:29] so jesus is that door where we can come
[43:32] to our heavenly father
[43:33] and receive revelation of the word of
[43:37] god
[43:38] to receive the living word he holds
[43:41] the key that unlocks the very life
[43:45] of the word in other words we read it
[43:48] but it's not unlocked it's
[43:52] it's a written word the letter killeth
[43:55] that's why brother brown didn't say just
[43:57] read he said
[43:59] read your bible and pray and read your
[44:01] bible
[44:02] because we need jesus to unlock
[44:05] the word that we're reading
[44:08] to unlock it to us to show us what it
[44:11] really means
[44:12] because we're saying would you tell us
[44:14] plainly
[44:16] what does this mean tell me plainly
[44:19] that when this when you fall in love
[44:21] with this word i'll say the written word
[44:24] when i'm saying the written word because
[44:26] god can speak to all of our hearts
[44:28] not in this word and it's just as much
[44:30] the word as when he
[44:31] is this word because it's his voice
[44:34] and he's alive and he can speak anytime
[44:38] but the thing is we need to put more
[44:39] emphasis on this
[44:41] more emphasis on this because this is
[44:44] sure and amen
[44:45] god sent a prophet to tell us that this
[44:47] word is just the same yesterday today
[44:49] and forever
[44:50] i want us to be focusing on god speaking
[44:52] to us through the word
[44:54] amen
[45:00] just like we should be hearing his voice
[45:02] more in service
[45:05] yes god can speak to us outside of
[45:07] service but don't be a little the path
[45:09] that god has made for us
[45:11] that is right that's why he said for
[45:14] satan at the assembly and all the laws
[45:16] we see the day approaching because we
[45:17] have to get ready
[45:18] well i'm already saved see what i'm
[45:21] saying
[45:22] we can get so twisted off in those
[45:23] voices out there
[45:26] now the first thing in our reading today
[45:29] in this great chapter chapter 10 jesus
[45:32] describes
[45:33] the person who doesn't come to the door
[45:36] as a thief
[45:37] and as a robber well the very first
[45:40] thing
[45:41] amazing webster's dictionary defines the
[45:45] thief
[45:46] is one that steals
[45:49] especially secretly
[45:57] a thief is someone who takes something
[45:59] that doesn't belong to him
[46:02] now this is the first thing that jesus
[46:04] is talking about
[46:06] he unlawfully takes something
[46:09] that doesn't belong to him
[46:14] a robber is one that uses violence
[46:17] and force to take something away and if
[46:20] you've been
[46:21] watched any of the news out there uh you
[46:24] you'll see that they're
[46:25] they're they they loot they they go in
[46:27] there they rob places
[46:29] and they use violence to to take it
[46:33] to be a good example robert will use
[46:36] some sort of threats like uh he'll he'll
[46:39] come in with
[46:40] the cashier and how to hold them up and
[46:42] say you better give me everything you
[46:44] got
[46:45] where a thief never has to meet their
[46:48] victim
[46:49] they stole like they stole the bracelet
[46:52] when no one was looking
[46:54] now here jesus says that's all that ever
[46:56] came before me
[46:59] these are the two characteristics that
[47:01] come before christ
[47:03] and jesus describes these individuals as
[47:06] wanting
[47:06] to be a thief or they're a thief in the
[47:10] robber
[47:10] and it's a very large group
[47:14] he says in verse 8 john 10 verse 8
[47:18] all that ever came before me
[47:21] are thieves and robbers
[47:25] what a strong message jesus is telling
[47:28] us
[47:29] all a strong message
[47:34] all that ever came before me they're
[47:36] just thieves they're just robbers
[47:41] what are they trying to rob and steal
[47:43] from god
[47:46] that's right they're trying to steal
[47:48] life
[47:49] eternal life
[47:52] because he is the door to get there
[47:57] but you know what it could be a whole
[47:58] host of things too
[48:01] people like to use god for a lot of
[48:03] things
[48:05] now god is a good god and he wants to
[48:07] bless everyone
[48:08] even his enemies he's rich in mercy he's
[48:12] full of grace
[48:14] god is a god of perfect love for god so
[48:17] loved the world that he gave his only
[48:19] begotten
[48:20] son god wants to give eternal life to
[48:23] this large
[48:24] group of people that wants eternal life
[48:27] so what's the big deal
[48:31] jesus said come unto me all ye that
[48:33] labor and heavy laden and i will give
[48:34] you rest
[48:36] what's the big deal why doesn't god just
[48:39] give it to them
[48:43] it's because they're unwilling to take
[48:45] god's yoke
[48:48] what does that mean brother john they
[48:51] want eternal life
[48:54] while they have their selfish nature
[48:57] they want to live forever while being
[48:59] self-centered
[49:00] and self-serving and i and i it's all
[49:03] about me
[49:06] they want eternal life without being
[49:08] born again without the new birth
[49:11] they want eternal life without a nature
[49:13] change
[49:14] from self to it's all about god
[49:18] second corinthians 5 17 says therefore
[49:21] if any man be in christ
[49:22] he is a new creature o thinks you're
[49:24] passed away behold all things have
[49:25] become new
[49:26] and all things are of god
[49:31] all things are of god amen
[49:35] so this is the hang-up all that come
[49:38] before the lord are thieves and robbers
[49:43] they want my somehow
[49:49] i got some extra pages in here again how
[49:52] did that happen
[49:56] all that ever came before me are thieves
[49:59] and
[50:00] robbers i remember when i came to know
[50:03] my sinful condition
[50:06] i really wanted to escape hell i was
[50:08] afraid of hell
[50:09] i didn't want to go to hell
[50:13] like the song that we sing it was grace
[50:16] that taught my heart to fear
[50:18] but it was also grace my fears relieved
[50:23] but then i began to bargain with god
[50:27] for cheryl i'm a thief
[50:31] and a robber
[50:34] i just didn't come to god and say god
[50:37] i'll surrender everything
[50:38] take me and i'm not going to ask one
[50:40] thing no i wanted to hang out in my long
[50:43] hair
[50:43] my records i was hanging on everything i
[50:45] could
[50:50] and if you're honest with yourself you
[50:53] can see
[50:54] what jesus means
[50:58] my flesh wanted to give up the least
[51:00] amount that it had to
[51:02] to gain salvation i wasn't interested in
[51:06] these
[51:07] things that god was wanting me to do i
[51:10] want to give up my music you don't know
[51:11] how much money
[51:12] and time i spent in it
[51:15] it was my selfish life
[51:19] but i still wanted salvation i still
[51:21] wanted to be forgiven
[51:25] giving up anything short of your entire
[51:29] temporal life for his eternal life
[51:32] would be an absolute insult to god
[51:36] it would be a slap in his face
[51:40] we should all be thanking god that he
[51:43] turned his cheek
[51:44] towards us a number of times
[51:47] when we slapped him he turned his cheek
[51:50] again to us
[51:50] and gave us another chance because we
[51:53] don't want to give up everything
[51:59] jesus would consider anyone a thief or a
[52:02] robber
[52:02] who would climb up some other way than
[52:04] surrendering their complete will over to
[52:06] him
[52:09] philippians chapter 3 verse 7
[52:13] paul said but what things were gained to
[52:15] me
[52:16] i counted loss for christ yay
[52:19] doubtless and i count all things but
[52:22] lost for the excellency of the knowledge
[52:24] of christ
[52:24] jesus my lord for whom i have suffered
[52:27] the loss of all things and you count
[52:29] them but dung
[52:30] in order for me to gain
[52:35] eternal life which is really jesus
[52:38] christ
[52:41] he had to give up his life for god's
[52:44] life
[52:46] it wasn't a special calling everybody
[52:49] has to do that
[52:53] if we don't surrender all how is jesus
[52:57] going to view you and me
[53:03] because we're always asking for things
[53:06] we're always wanting things
[53:11] he just he just wants us to surrender
[53:13] amen
[53:15] surrender to this word my
[53:18] sheep hear my voice
[53:21] and follow me
[53:28] jesus is the door and behind the door is
[53:30] eternal life
[53:31] he's the good shepherd he holds the keys
[53:33] of eternal life
[53:35] he said in verse 27 my sheep hear my
[53:38] voice i know them and they follow me
[53:40] and i will give unto them eternal life
[53:45] he's leading us to eternal life
[53:51] why would he got it potentially yes
[53:54] potentially your son potentially always
[53:56] where
[53:57] but potentially you got to endure to the
[54:00] end
[54:01] you got to take all the scriptures
[54:04] that's why we need
[54:05] to study to show ourself approval so
[54:07] those other voices
[54:09] don't say well you've already saved you
[54:11] do what you want to do now
[54:14] his voice is his word amen and jesus
[54:16] said my
[54:17] words are spirit and their life so his
[54:20] voice catch this his voice is spirit
[54:24] in their life the very voice of god
[54:28] that's why we need
[54:29] to really hear from god when the
[54:31] preacher is preaching
[54:34] that we're not hearing from a man
[54:47] this thing is deteriorating
[54:52] excuse me i didn't know that was going
[54:53] to happen
[54:55] we got new equipment coming soon
[55:00] peter testified thou alone has the words
[55:03] of eternal life
[55:05] jesus gave peter the keys of the kingdom
[55:08] and we find out matthew chapter 16 verse
[55:11] 19
[55:11] and i will give unto thee the keys of
[55:14] the kingdom of heaven
[55:15] and whatever you bind on earth shall be
[55:17] bound in heaven whatever you loosen her
[55:19] shall be loosed in heaven
[55:21] and peter began to exercise his
[55:23] authority three verses later
[55:26] when he rebuked the words of eternal
[55:29] life
[55:31] now peter didn't really receive the keys
[55:34] that very moment did he
[55:36] nor the following week or the following
[55:39] month
[55:42] god is not going to hand over the keys
[55:44] of eternal life to someone who doesn't
[55:46] have control
[55:49] brother bran said power without
[55:50] character
[55:52] to use that power correctly is satanic
[55:56] can you imagine peter having the keys
[55:59] with his selfish
[56:00] nature oh no jesus
[56:04] you're not going to cross you and i
[56:06] wouldn't be saved today
[56:10] if peter would have exercised his power
[56:14] with the keys that he had
[56:15] with his selfish nature without being
[56:18] born again
[56:19] jesus would have never went to the cross
[56:25] he's not going to hand over just here it
[56:28] is with the selfish nature
[56:29] we need to get serious about this more
[56:32] than just
[56:34] hearing these things out here
[56:39] come on amen
[56:42] peter's great idea would have kept jesus
[56:44] from dying
[56:47] peter did not have a vision beyond
[56:50] himself
[56:52] too often we make jesus all about us
[56:55] instead of
[56:55] living for others jesus was about living
[56:58] for others but peter wasn't
[57:00] amen
[57:05] when eve did her own will she did
[57:07] exactly what satan was taught her to do
[57:10] eve had eternal life but she was
[57:14] enticed to do her own will at the same
[57:17] time
[57:20] and when she did she forfeited her right
[57:22] to eternal life
[57:24] god put flaming swords to protect the
[57:26] way of eternal life
[57:28] while exercising her own
[57:31] will above god's will
[57:36] think about it before it was no problem
[57:39] you could hey
[57:40] here's the tree of life you just do
[57:42] whatever you want i'm here for you
[57:45] but as soon as she exercised her own
[57:48] will
[57:49] above god's will she no longer had
[57:52] right to the tree of life i want you to
[57:54] think about that
[57:55] how much god hates our will
[58:00] we've got to deny ourself amen pick up
[58:03] our cross
[58:04] and follow christ follow my sheep know
[58:07] my voice
[58:08] and they follow me
[58:13] let's take a look at this in genesis
[58:15] chapter 2 verse 9.
[58:17] genesis chapter 2 verse 9 and out of the
[58:20] ground made the lord god to grow every
[58:22] tree that was pleasant to sight
[58:23] and good for food notice these were
[58:25] natural trees because you could see them
[58:27] they were good for sight these were
[58:30] natural trees
[58:31] the tree of life also was in the midst
[58:34] of the garden and the tree of knowledge
[58:35] of good and evil now these were
[58:37] invisible trees
[58:39] you couldn't see these
[58:42] the tree of knowledge of good and evil
[58:44] is a spiritual tree
[58:46] that has the knowledge of what is good
[58:48] and right
[58:49] and pleasing to god yet chooses to do
[58:53] its own will instead that is that simple
[58:56] which will always be evil in the sight
[58:59] of god
[59:00] this is the real mix of the tree it's
[59:03] the knowledge of good
[59:05] but choosing not to do it that's called
[59:07] evil
[59:09] now the nature of this this tree is
[59:12] selfish
[59:13] obviously just by the the very fact that
[59:16] you do what you want to do instead
[59:19] i will exalt my throne above the throne
[59:21] of god i
[59:22] will be like the most high i will do my
[59:25] will above god's will i i i
[59:30] that's what this tree is and you know
[59:32] we're all born with this nature
[59:35] headed straight to hell our first
[59:39] birth had nothing to do with god
[59:44] oh yeah but god knew about it before the
[59:46] foundation of the world
[59:49] you know we'll talk about that we'll
[59:50] talk about being predestinated
[59:54] but our first birth had nothing to do
[59:56] with god
[59:58] he just knew about it that's why we have
[1:00:01] to be born again
[1:00:02] amen born according to the way
[1:00:06] god wants us born we were born to do the
[1:00:10] will of god
[1:00:11] we were born to hear his voice and
[1:00:13] follow him
[1:00:17] ephesians chapter 2 verse 3
[1:00:20] we all had our conversations in times
[1:00:23] past
[1:00:24] in the lust of our flesh fulfilling the
[1:00:26] desires of the flesh and of the mind
[1:00:27] we're by look at nature
[1:00:30] the children of
[1:00:35] children of wrath even as others
[1:00:39] what causes a child or even an adult
[1:00:43] to stir up wrath in their nature what is
[1:00:46] it
[1:00:46] come on simple
[1:00:49] exactly when you don't get what you want
[1:00:52] you're going to get upset about it
[1:00:56] not getting what a person really wants
[1:00:59] bad
[1:01:00] will cause them to get angry
[1:01:04] and we've got a whole world full of it
[1:01:07] just turn on the news it won't be just a
[1:01:09] few minutes
[1:01:11] turn on the tv
[1:01:14] look at the billboards
[1:01:17] i we went up north and we had heard from
[1:01:21] a few different restaurants
[1:01:22] how the people were so rude in various
[1:01:26] restaurants
[1:01:26] we heard this from the the way staff of
[1:01:28] the people is
[1:01:29] a common thing right now well we know
[1:01:33] hatred is is is going to increase
[1:01:38] but wrath comes about when you don't get
[1:01:40] what you want
[1:01:45] jesus said unless we become born again
[1:01:48] with a
[1:01:49] totally opposite nature we can enter the
[1:01:52] kingdom
[1:01:53] in other words we cannot enter the
[1:01:54] kingdom with this nature
[1:02:00] we can't be a thief and a robber
[1:02:08] when paul
[1:02:12] finally surrendered to the lord
[1:02:15] he didn't say i want this back
[1:02:19] i want this in return here's my want
[1:02:22] list
[1:02:27] we all have this want list
[1:02:31] we just need to get rid of it the lord
[1:02:34] is my shepherd
[1:02:35] i shall not want he is the good
[1:02:38] shepherd and and look we all got this
[1:02:41] battle
[1:02:42] look i'm preaching to me the lord is
[1:02:44] preaching to me
[1:02:48] we've it's a it's a a tremendous battle
[1:02:51] we we all have it but we stand
[1:02:54] in the way we we can't get by with a
[1:02:57] slightly
[1:02:58] different improved nature
[1:03:03] it's a nature change where all things
[1:03:05] are passed away behold all things
[1:03:08] have become god
[1:03:11] they become new they become of god it's
[1:03:14] no longer just
[1:03:17] going from one frying pan to the next
[1:03:20] that could be new but they have to be of
[1:03:23] god
[1:03:25] where it's no longer our will but god's
[1:03:28] will
[1:03:29] first peter chapter 1 verse 22 seeing he
[1:03:31] have purified
[1:03:33] how do you do this brother john seeing
[1:03:35] that you purified your souls how do i do
[1:03:37] that
[1:03:38] real simple in
[1:03:41] obeying the truth
[1:03:44] through the spirit unto unfeigned love
[1:03:47] to the brethren
[1:03:48] see that you love one another with a
[1:03:50] pure heart fervently
[1:03:52] so this is this is so so simple yet so
[1:03:56] important
[1:03:57] take time to read your bible every day
[1:03:59] with this purpose
[1:04:00] lord show me what you want me to obey
[1:04:03] today amen
[1:04:06] we we think we already read it i already
[1:04:08] got it i need something new
[1:04:10] stay with the simplicity of making
[1:04:13] contact with god
[1:04:15] when you read the bible yes amen
[1:04:19] it worked for abraham
[1:04:23] it worked for brother branham
[1:04:27] he told us to do it stay with the word
[1:04:37] being born again not
[1:04:40] of a corruptible seed but of
[1:04:42] incorruptible by
[1:04:43] by the word of god which liveth and
[1:04:47] abideth
[1:04:48] forever so

[1:04:58] you

[1:05:01] you've seen that before and he's
[1:05:02] reminded you
[1:05:03] and he wants you to start doing maybe
[1:05:05] haven't been doing it
[1:05:08] the simplicity of you obeying that is
[1:05:11] the process of you becoming born again

[1:05:37] to genesis here genesis chapter 2 verse
[1:05:39] 9
[1:05:39] and out of the ground made the lord god
[1:05:40] to grow every tree that was pleasant to
[1:05:42] sight
[1:05:43] good for food and the tree of life also
[1:05:46] was in the mid cigar in the tree of
[1:05:47] knowledge of good and evil
[1:05:49] verse 5 said that there was no man to
[1:05:52] till the ground
[1:05:55] okay so he made the garden but there was
[1:05:58] no man to till it
[1:05:59] the ground still needs to be tilled it
[1:06:02] would have been hard for brother
[1:06:04] mike and my wife and sister ann to
[1:06:08] uh actually plant the garden if it
[1:06:10] didn't get tilled
[1:06:12] it has a tendency of getting hard verse
[1:06:16] 15 and the lord god
[1:06:17] took the man and put him into the garden
[1:06:19] of eden
[1:06:20] to dress it and to keep it so he tilled
[1:06:23] it dress it keep it that was his job
[1:06:27] and the lord god commanded the man
[1:06:30] saying of
[1:06:31] every tree of the god thou mayest freely
[1:06:33] eat but of the tree of the
[1:06:35] knowledge of good and evil thou shall
[1:06:37] not eat of it
[1:06:38] for in the day thou eatest there thou
[1:06:40] shall surely die
[1:06:43] through all the times that satan
[1:06:46] had talked to eve he never
[1:06:50] told eve the consequences of what would
[1:06:53] happen to her
[1:06:54] if if she part
[1:06:57] if she partook of him
[1:07:02] in fact he lied about it and he said
[1:07:05] thou
[1:07:05] shalt not surely die and that's how
[1:07:09] these false spirits speak to us
[1:07:13] thou shall not surely die you don't you
[1:07:15] can do whatever you want to
[1:07:17] it's just a preacher's opinion you don't
[1:07:20] have to listen you can act any way you
[1:07:22] want
[1:07:23] you can say whatever you want to say you
[1:07:24] can do whatever you want to do
[1:07:26] and don't you worry you're still a son
[1:07:28] and daughter of god
[1:07:33] and that's how he gets us off track he
[1:07:36] takes us away from the fear of god
[1:07:40] my sheep know my voice and they
[1:07:43] follow me
[1:07:46] the importance of this word
[1:07:49] it needs to mean more to us it needs to
[1:07:53] become like our gold knox
[1:07:57] everything that we've worked for
[1:07:59] everything that we labor for
[1:08:01] everything that means so much to us
[1:08:03] that's what this word needs to become
[1:08:08] jesus said in saint john chapter 10
[1:08:11] verse 4 and when he putteth forth his
[1:08:13] own
[1:08:14] sheep he goeth before them and
[1:08:17] the sheep follow him for they know his
[1:08:19] voice
[1:08:20] verse 5 and a stranger will they not
[1:08:24] follow but will flee from him for they
[1:08:27] know not
[1:08:28] the voice of strangers
[1:08:32] when somebody says something well ask
[1:08:35] that you know don't bait
[1:08:38] that's a strange voice
[1:08:42] well i don't need to do strange voice
[1:08:47] if the word says it i
[1:08:50] i recognize that voice i follow that
[1:08:53] voice
[1:08:56] we've got to take time to recognize that
[1:08:59] these things that we're hearing
[1:09:00] whether they're in our minds our
[1:09:02] imaginations our thoughts
[1:09:04] i don't care how it comes because we
[1:09:06] know as our brother said
[1:09:07] sunday that satan's coming with lying
[1:09:10] wonders right
[1:09:13] so
[1:09:16] of all the things that satan has set
[1:09:20] on the bible says the throne of god
[1:09:24] as if he is god the temple of god excuse
[1:09:27] me the temple of god second
[1:09:28] thessalonians 2
[1:09:30] well this could be considered a temple
[1:09:32] sits in the temple
[1:09:34] showing himself as he's god but this
[1:09:36] also could be a temple
[1:09:37] i don't know what's talking about the
[1:09:39] antichrist but hear me
[1:09:41] it's the spirit is the same thing he's
[1:09:43] trying to gain control
[1:09:45] he's trying to act like he's god and how
[1:09:47] does he do it oh you don't got to do
[1:09:48] that you don't gotta you can just do
[1:09:50] whatever you want to do it's okay if you
[1:09:52] cut your hair it's okay if you wear
[1:09:53] makeup it's okay if you say those things
[1:09:55] look at those things do this
[1:09:56] it doesn't matter you'll be fine you're
[1:09:58] still you're still predestinated
[1:10:01] it's a wrong voice because
[1:10:05] there's two voices in reality
[1:10:08] in reality stemming from two voices
[1:10:12] one will be completely the word
[1:10:15] the other voices will always be
[1:10:18] mixed with part of the word
[1:10:22] that's how he got eve he did not come to
[1:10:24] eve and say
[1:10:25] your god is completely out of the wacko
[1:10:30] no in fact you're going to be just like
[1:10:31] the guy you believe in maybe just like
[1:10:33] him
[1:10:35] you know he he just he's just hold this
[1:10:37] back for this moment but once you just
[1:10:39] you know partake of me then you're going
[1:10:40] to be just like him
[1:10:42] knowing good and evil but god doesn't
[1:10:44] want us to know evil
[1:10:50] we're the ones that want to know evil
[1:10:52] we're the ones that want to
[1:10:54] feel this enticement
[1:10:58] the ones that want to feel i'm going to
[1:11:00] get so mad at her at him i'm going to
[1:11:02] show them
[1:11:04] i'm going to just i'm never going to
[1:11:06] talk to them again
[1:11:08] partake of that evil
[1:11:12] but that should be a strange voice to
[1:11:14] the right
[1:11:16] strange voice just because you're a
[1:11:20] child of god
[1:11:22] doesn't mean you won't end up listening
[1:11:24] to the devil
[1:11:25] sometime thinking it was god
[1:11:30] just because you're the elect of god
[1:11:31] doesn't mean you won't end up following
[1:11:33] the devil for a while
[1:11:34] and not even know it
[1:11:38] just because you're marching to the song
[1:11:39] of onward christian soldiers
[1:11:41] marching as to war doesn't mean you
[1:11:43] won't get out of step
[1:11:48] doesn't mean you won't get sidetracked
[1:11:51] it doesn't mean you won't forget about
[1:11:53] your calling your responsibilities or
[1:11:55] your ministry
[1:11:56] of reconciliation that god has given
[1:11:58] every one of us
[1:12:01] we can backslide we can become
[1:12:04] carnal proud selfish
[1:12:08] and not even recognize it
[1:12:12] just because we are his child
[1:12:15] doesn't mean we're never going to be
[1:12:18] deceived for a period of time
[1:12:25] matthew 24 24 for there shall rise false
[1:12:29] christ and false prophets and shall
[1:12:32] show great signs and wonders in so much
[1:12:36] as if it were possible they shall
[1:12:37] deceive the very
[1:12:39] elect
[1:12:43] we get tripped up and we may get tripped
[1:12:47] up a lot more
[1:12:49] but the truth will always
[1:12:52] find us and set us free
[1:12:57] he won't leave us in that condition when
[1:13:00] he the spirit of truth come he will
[1:13:02] guide you into all truth he jesus told
[1:13:05] pilate everyone that is of truth
[1:13:07] heareth my voice we will eventually hear
[1:13:10] the voice
[1:13:11] and if we are his sheep it's real easy
[1:13:15] we just follow it we follow the word of
[1:13:18] god
[1:13:19] the sheep of god follow the word of god
[1:13:23] it's not about well i'm so special i
[1:13:26] will never
[1:13:26] get deceived it doesn't matter what
[1:13:28] doctrine they throw at me i can figure
[1:13:30] it out
[1:13:30] i'm gonna know that ain't what he's
[1:13:32] talking about friends
[1:13:35] how well can you follow this word amen
[1:13:41] you know the thing is we're not even
[1:13:43] interested
[1:13:45] and making sure we're following the word
[1:13:47] that's true
[1:13:48] we get to a place where we're assuming
[1:13:50] we follow it
[1:13:56] and we ought to be seeking god more
[1:13:59] and more and more making sure turning
[1:14:01] over every rock lord am i pleasing you
[1:14:03] am i doing the right thing
[1:14:05] amen because in this laodicean spirit we
[1:14:08] don't think things matter very much
[1:14:11] but they do the serpent
[1:14:15] beguiled eve
[1:14:18] amen but what does that mean
[1:14:22] that mean that word begotten means led
[1:14:24] astray
[1:14:26] the serpent led her astray
[1:14:29] the tree of knowledge mentally deluded
[1:14:33] her mentally diluted her
[1:14:36] through the serpent he misled
[1:14:40] her mind
[1:14:44] the serpent seduced her
[1:14:47] that means persuaded her to be
[1:14:50] disobedient without knowing it
[1:14:55] thought was doing the right thing
[1:14:59] now it's no different than what the
[1:15:01] devil does say
[1:15:02] to each of us every day
[1:15:06] tries to get us to think that we don't
[1:15:10] have to do what the word tells us to do
[1:15:15] we may get begotted by a spirit that has
[1:15:18] the knowledge of truth
[1:15:20] and it will entice us it would tell us
[1:15:22] that it's not necessary
[1:15:24] to follow everything but the spirit of
[1:15:26] truth
[1:15:27] will show us will bring us back and will
[1:15:30] make us obey the word if we are his
[1:15:32] sheep
[1:15:32] because the word cannot lie my sheep
[1:15:35] know my voice and they will follow me
[1:15:39] it's got to come back to that
[1:15:43] god will not allow his own elect to stay
[1:15:46] in a condition
[1:15:47] of air
[1:15:51] so it's not about every time we fall
[1:15:54] we must not be elect i'm sorry don't you
[1:15:57] ever
[1:15:57] think that
[1:16:06] a righteous man falls seven times seven
[1:16:07] times get back up
[1:16:10] when peter asked jesus how many times do
[1:16:12] i need to
[1:16:13] you know forgive this person seven times
[1:16:16] if if if jesus was so sold on the
[1:16:18] doctrine of uh
[1:16:20] well you know we're just predestined if
[1:16:22] they fall seven times they must not be
[1:16:24] my sheep they're not following me they
[1:16:25] must be of the devil
[1:16:27] you know just you know forget after
[1:16:28] seven
[1:16:31] no no seven times seventy just
[1:16:34] live the life live the life
[1:16:40] when uh when a person be overtaking the
[1:16:42] fault you which are spiritual go to him
[1:16:43] in the spirit of meekness and fear
[1:16:48] it god is still
[1:16:52] restoring his bride amen
[1:16:56] and think about i'll be honest all the
[1:16:58] time that god has spoke to you something
[1:17:00] to do
[1:17:01] and you didn't do it but yet you'll
[1:17:04] still say i'm a child of god i'm
[1:17:06] predestined i'm
[1:17:07] the bride you'll stand firm on that
[1:17:11] but then your brother or sister will do
[1:17:12] something wrong
[1:17:14] and you'll begin to question whether
[1:17:16] they're seed or not
[1:17:18] that is not right
[1:17:25] we're all on the same ship
[1:17:30] god will send the spirit of truth to
[1:17:32] always
[1:17:33] correct the air always
[1:17:37] john 16 verse 12 i have yet many things
[1:17:39] to say unto you
[1:17:40] but you can't even handle it
[1:17:43] you can't you can't bear it you can't
[1:17:46] carry it it's too heavy for you
[1:17:49] how be it when you receive more of the
[1:17:52] spirit of god
[1:17:54] it's called the spirit of truth he the
[1:17:56] spirit of truth
[1:17:58] is come he will guide you into all truth
[1:18:00] for he shall not speak of himself
[1:18:02] but whatsoever he shall hear that shall
[1:18:05] he speak and he shall show you things to
[1:18:07] come
[1:18:09] i'll talk a little bit about that
[1:18:12] when the holy ghost is leading you he
[1:18:14] will not be leading you
[1:18:16] to you to do your will
[1:18:19] he will not testify of you
[1:18:24] not to do your own thing it's not about
[1:18:26] you it's an it's it's about
[1:18:29] christ it's all about the will of god
[1:18:34] first john chapter four verse one first
[1:18:36] john chapter four verse one we went
[1:18:38] through this with a
[1:18:39] a series not long ago beloved believe
[1:18:42] not every spirit
[1:18:43] but try the spirits where they are of
[1:18:45] god because many false prophets are
[1:18:47] going out to the world
[1:18:50] what are these spirits doing they're
[1:18:51] trying to get you tripped up
[1:18:55] they're trying to get us astray
[1:18:58] lead us astray from obeying the word
[1:19:00] just like you did eve
[1:19:03] hereby know you the spirit of god every
[1:19:05] spirit that confesseth
[1:19:07] that jesus has come in the flesh is of
[1:19:09] god
[1:19:10] the only way that john would testify
[1:19:12] that something was of god
[1:19:14] is when the word became manifested in
[1:19:16] the flesh
[1:19:17] and until that happens we don't know yet
[1:19:23] are you with me
[1:19:27] well what about what about this
[1:19:30] these this woman that came talking about
[1:19:33] paul
[1:19:34] this damn soul talking about paul these
[1:19:37] these be the men of god they preached us
[1:19:39] to the way of salvation they're teaching
[1:19:41] us
[1:19:41] over and over and over coming out of
[1:19:43] their mouth speaking the truth but it
[1:19:45] wasn't manifested in their flesh
[1:19:48] their spirit was not of god no ye
[1:19:51] despair try the spirit that's what paul
[1:19:53] did
[1:19:57] every spirit that won't manifest the
[1:20:00] word in
[1:20:01] flesh is not of god
[1:20:05] see the devils believe they know
[1:20:08] they tremble they certainly have the
[1:20:10] knowledge of the truth it's undeniable
[1:20:13] the reason that they tremble is they
[1:20:15] don't have enough love in their heart
[1:20:16] to obey the word and that sets every one
[1:20:20] of us
[1:20:21] we hear the word of god and we don't
[1:20:23] love god enough to obey it what does
[1:20:25] that show
[1:20:27] it doesn't matter what we claim
[1:20:30] it's all about following the word follow
[1:20:33] the word follow the word
[1:20:35] we don't follow the word by just coming
[1:20:36] to church
[1:20:38] or saying them in the message there's a
[1:20:41] lot of word in there
[1:20:44] and all you gotta do is take time to
[1:20:45] look at your life
[1:20:49] they know it the devils know they're
[1:20:50] religious enough
[1:20:52] to know the word they even have a form
[1:20:54] of it
[1:20:55] but they deny the power to live it
[1:21:00] and we're told turn away from it
[1:21:02] strangers
[1:21:03] they don't know that voice they stay
[1:21:05] away from that
[1:21:07] they don't mix with that they don't want
[1:21:09] that a part of them
[1:21:12] i'll say run to calvary and every spirit
[1:21:16] that confesseth not that jesus christ
[1:21:18] is coming the flesh is not of god and
[1:21:20] this is the spirit of antichrist
[1:21:21] wherever you have heard that it should
[1:21:23] come and now already is in the world
[1:21:25] your god little children have overcome
[1:21:27] them because
[1:21:28] something is greater that's in you
[1:21:30] that's god than he that's in the world
[1:21:33] and thereof the world therefore they
[1:21:34] speak of the world and the world heareth
[1:21:36] them
[1:21:38] but not god's sheep a stranger though
[1:21:41] not follow
[1:21:43] we are of god we know that god heareth
[1:21:46] us
[1:21:46] and that he that is not of god hearth
[1:21:50] not us hereby know we the spirit of
[1:21:52] truth
[1:21:53] and the spirit of air in of
[1:21:56] every voice that ever speaks to you
[1:22:04] it's either a spirit of truth or it's a
[1:22:05] spirit of air
[1:22:07] every voice the inspiration
[1:22:10] is coming from one or two trees it is
[1:22:14] and
[1:22:19] if i
[1:22:24] um told brother mark brother mark
[1:22:29] you're gonna get a brand new cadillac
[1:22:31] tomorrow it is
[1:22:32] just saying the lord it's gonna happen i
[1:22:34] know god told me he told me to tell you
[1:22:36] it's gonna happen
[1:22:39] well two days go by and the car's not
[1:22:42] there
[1:22:44] i think at this point brother mark is
[1:22:47] going to
[1:22:47] question me
[1:22:51] he's going to question me because
[1:22:54] there's an
[1:22:54] heir there
[1:22:57] now he would look at me a little bit
[1:23:00] like
[1:23:02] are you with me and he has every right
[1:23:05] to
[1:23:07] but when the devil has come to him and
[1:23:10] spoke to him
[1:23:11] something that he thought was god and it
[1:23:13] didn't happen
[1:23:22] do you see what i'm trying to say
[1:23:26] we brush off the things we think are of
[1:23:30] god and
[1:23:30] when we find out they're not but we just
[1:23:33] have a standoffish look
[1:23:35] when somebody else has done the same
[1:23:37] thing
[1:23:40] what we need to do is be interested
[1:23:43] in the things that we thought were of
[1:23:46] god and that we're not
[1:23:48] we need to be interested in that we need
[1:23:51] to be concerned about that
[1:23:55] because we're taught to try the spirit
[1:23:58] no
[1:23:59] i'm not going to probably have time to
[1:24:01] preach everything i really want to
[1:24:02] preach here and i'm sorry because
[1:24:04] there's a lot of good stuff in this
[1:24:05] world it's a teaching
[1:24:07] there are so many things that god speaks
[1:24:09] to us that is not in that word
[1:24:12] or we think there's a lot of things that
[1:24:14] god speaks to us that's not a network
[1:24:16] but i could say safely that god does
[1:24:18] speak to us things
[1:24:19] that are not in the word and we have no
[1:24:21] way to prove it
[1:24:24] there's just no way so what do we do
[1:24:34] well we know it if it's in the word
[1:24:38] it's a good sign right
[1:24:43] but if it's not written right there in
[1:24:47] the word exactly to detail what we're
[1:24:49] talking about
[1:24:51] we don't know it may be like the other
[1:24:54] things that satan told me
[1:24:56] that didn't come to pass and i thought
[1:24:57] they were oh god
[1:25:00] now remember when god he's when i was
[1:25:03] driving down the road and i've shared
[1:25:04] this many times and he told me that
[1:25:06] there was going to be
[1:25:07] a building my business was going to be
[1:25:09] right there in the middle of a field
[1:25:13] well i never told my wife
[1:25:17] i never told my pastor but i watched him
[1:25:21] bring it to pass without a loan
[1:25:29] and nobody gave me anything except god
[1:25:35] now that i can't find that in the word
[1:25:39] but i never felt this pull
[1:25:43] to let everybody know it was a secret
[1:25:47] very good god wanted
[1:25:51] to prove himself to me that's good
[1:25:55] he wanted to build my relationship with
[1:25:57] him
[1:25:58] he wanted me to have confidence in him
[1:26:02] amen you can't give that to anybody
[1:26:09] but something like that there was no way
[1:26:11] i could prove it
[1:26:12] no way no matter what i said i couldn't
[1:26:15] prove it
[1:26:18] i had to wait for it to come to pass and
[1:26:20] just he interpreted
[1:26:23] his word by bringing it to pass now say
[1:26:26] that stuff doesn't happen all the time
[1:26:28] i'm going to say this stuff doesn't
[1:26:30] happen very often
[1:26:33] he speaks it's not like that
[1:26:37] all the time
[1:26:40] that's right what he does speak
[1:26:44] every day is to follow
[1:26:48] this word that he's been trying to get
[1:26:50] across to us
[1:26:52] this means more to him i don't mean it
[1:26:55] wrong
[1:26:56] but it means more to him than trusted
[1:26:58] tool
[1:27:00] trusted two is his word not against it
[1:27:04] but understand the emphasis needs to be
[1:27:07] here he's speaking to us this word
[1:27:10] to pray for one another to to reach out
[1:27:13] to others to
[1:27:14] to forgive others to to help others
[1:27:18] it's really good to pray
[1:27:22] to read to get ready
[1:27:25] he's coming soon this is what's
[1:27:28] important
[1:27:30] that trusted tool is a tool
[1:27:34] isn't that funny he's using it
[1:27:39] in many different ways
[1:27:43] oh i'd love to testify
[1:27:52] god's voice is his word
[1:27:55] it will not return void it will
[1:27:57] accomplish the purpose
[1:27:58] it was spoken when he said let there be
[1:28:02] light let there be anything rest assured
[1:28:05] it's going to happen
[1:28:06] because he spoke it
[1:28:10] you can bank on it and then sometimes he
[1:28:13] speaks if thou doest well
[1:28:16] won't thou be accepted in other words
[1:28:20] god ain't going to deny his word
[1:28:21] if you do well you're going to be
[1:28:23] accepted but if you don't then
[1:28:25] sin lieth at the door
[1:28:32] well what sin sin is james said
[1:28:36] to him that knoweth to do good and doeth
[1:28:40] it not
[1:28:41] to him it's sin
[1:28:45] so it's important to do what we know to
[1:28:48] do
[1:28:48] i'll tell you our hands should be so
[1:28:50] full of that anything funny
[1:28:53] we shouldn't be swimming in more
[1:28:54] knowledge we need to be swimming and
[1:28:56] trying to keep up with
[1:28:57] doing what god has already showed us
[1:29:00] we're talking about
[1:29:01] really following the voice of god that
[1:29:03] we know is concrete
[1:29:05] because i don't know if truster 2 is
[1:29:07] going to be concrete
[1:29:09] i can't find it in there i don't know i
[1:29:11] gotta wait for him to bring it to pass
[1:29:13] but this word has already been
[1:29:15] vindicated
[1:29:17] we know to follow it we had a prophet
[1:29:20] come and
[1:29:21] ex break it down to us what it meant
[1:29:26] we need to follow it to a t it means to
[1:29:29] mean so much to us
[1:29:32] this is where we need to shine our light
[1:29:35] is look at me
[1:29:36] i'm the word on this word you can i can
[1:29:39] show you i'm a written epistle run of
[1:29:42] all man
[1:29:42] this is what i'm doing it's not trusted
[1:29:45] tool
[1:29:48] that's just personal
[1:29:52] you and god
[1:29:55] of course you pray for trusted too and i
[1:29:57] i pray for you and
[1:29:58] pray for one another's personal things
[1:30:05] but we need to go to seed on the word
[1:30:09] god's voice is not always going to be
[1:30:11] this
[1:30:12] thing is going to happen to you
[1:30:16] i understand the bible says the spirit
[1:30:18] will show you things to come
[1:30:22] and just like i testify to the business
[1:30:25] he showed me something to come but it's
[1:30:28] not always like that
[1:30:29] he may show you that something else is
[1:30:33] going to come
[1:30:34] like you may get persecuted
[1:30:37] persecution's on your way for taking a
[1:30:39] stand for the word
[1:30:42] he may show you that you're going to go
[1:30:43] through some hard trials he may show you
[1:30:45] that you're going to walk alone for a
[1:30:47] bit
[1:30:48] he may show you that you're going to get
[1:30:50] cold and formal if you don't pray
[1:30:52] through
[1:30:53] he may show you that you're going to
[1:30:55] lose your joy and your peace if you hold
[1:30:57] on to grudges
[1:30:59] god can show us a lot of things
[1:31:03] these things that that he shows us help
[1:31:07] are to help us to become better
[1:31:10] that's the purpose my sheep hear my
[1:31:13] voice
[1:31:14] i know them and they follow me the
[1:31:17] purpose of hearing
[1:31:18] the shepherd's voice is to follow what
[1:31:21] he says so number one
[1:31:22] we must know the difference between the
[1:31:24] voices we hear
[1:31:27] one is going to be completely scriptural
[1:31:30] the other one is going to be mixed
[1:31:34] now there are going to be those times
[1:31:35] you're going to have a business
[1:31:37] well i can't find it in the scriptures
[1:31:39] leave it there
[1:31:41] for the future leave it there
[1:31:44] watch and bring it to pass that's good
[1:31:48] well nobody's gonna know they're gonna
[1:31:50] think i i believed at the beginning
[1:31:52] it's not for everybody
[1:31:57] this is between you and god god showed
[1:31:59] you
[1:32:00] if god wanted me to be shown he'd show
[1:32:10] me
[1:32:13] pray to hear not just what you
[1:32:17] want to hear i'm looking for this
[1:32:21] it's wonderful but we need to be
[1:32:24] looking for this this is what we need to
[1:32:27] be interested
[1:32:28] show your interest to god with this
[1:32:30] don't come to church while i've already
[1:32:32] got that i already know i already
[1:32:33] believe the word priority
[1:32:35] that's why we're not getting what we
[1:32:37] need to be getting out of the message
[1:32:39] because we're coming too proud
[1:32:42] right we want to hear something new
[1:32:45] something different
[1:32:49] brother branham when you're going to get
[1:32:50] job off those ash heaps
[1:32:57] pray to hear what the spirit
[1:33:00] is saying to the church we're all
[1:33:04] sitting here we all hear the word
[1:33:05] every time it's being preached but
[1:33:08] everybody
[1:33:09] is not where you're at
[1:33:13] and if some people are falling asleep
[1:33:15] and some people can't wait till the
[1:33:16] service is over and
[1:33:18] and some people are not interested in
[1:33:20] what's being said and some people
[1:33:22] say they already know that make sure
[1:33:24] you're the one that says i'm the church
[1:33:26] and that word is for me
[1:33:29] because if you want to find favor with
[1:33:31] god stay with the word don't say your
[1:33:36] your purpose here is in vain because of
[1:33:39] x thousands of reasons
[1:33:45] sometimes god's going to see if we're
[1:33:46] going to move the bricks
[1:33:49] move the brakes what's the purpose move
[1:33:50] the bricks
[1:33:52] and move them without complaining move
[1:33:54] them without questioning me
[1:33:56] i want to tell you i don't know what my
[1:33:58] future is but the bible says that the
[1:34:00] good steps
[1:34:00] of the righteous are ordered of the lord
[1:34:03] that
[1:34:04] that he ordains the footsteps of the
[1:34:08] righteous
[1:34:10] i don't have to worry about it
[1:34:13] he's doing it i just got to fold this
[1:34:15] word
[1:34:16] he'll make sure that other things happen
[1:34:20] number two we have to obey what he says
[1:34:23] to us
[1:34:25] when we finally hear the voice of god
[1:34:27] we've got to obey it that
[1:34:28] otherwise we'll never follow christ
[1:34:35] the voice of god is the word of god
[1:34:39] we love to hear the voice of god speak
[1:34:41] to us about the things we want the
[1:34:43] things we desire
[1:34:44] the things we even think we need but the
[1:34:47] voice of god
[1:34:48] goes beyond what we desire to what the
[1:34:51] will of god is for our life
[1:34:56] the voice of god is the mind of god to
[1:34:58] us
[1:34:59] it's his word for us
[1:35:02] personally that's what i was trying to
[1:35:03] say when the word is being preached
[1:35:05] you must take this it's for you
[1:35:08] for you in other words if nobody else
[1:35:10] was here in church
[1:35:11] but you this is how much this word is
[1:35:13] for you
[1:35:14] now you're showing god what kind of
[1:35:18] relationship you're having with him in
[1:35:20] church
[1:35:22] why you're while you're here remember
[1:35:26] all that ever came before him were
[1:35:28] extremely
[1:35:29] selfish in their desires
[1:35:33] but not you not you
[1:35:37] you've learned i just want to do his
[1:35:40] will
[1:35:44] they didn't believe in coming to god to
[1:35:48] do his will
[1:35:50] they just wanted to escape damnation
[1:35:55] they just want to bargain with god oh
[1:35:57] god i'll serve you
[1:35:58] if you give me cheryl
[1:36:02] i'm so glad that god has brought that
[1:36:05] and
[1:36:05] kept that in my memory
[1:36:10] that's a thief and a robber all that
[1:36:13] ever came before me are thieves and
[1:36:14] robbers
[1:36:16] they're so recognizing they don't think
[1:36:19] about it
[1:36:21] and sometimes we we can come into church
[1:36:23] and make god some santa claus that's a
[1:36:24] thief and a robber
[1:36:27] just want god for our personal lives how
[1:36:30] about our personal lives
[1:36:31] doing what this written word says
[1:36:37] you know you want to be in the will of
[1:36:39] god i got one sure thing
[1:36:41] that will keep you in the will of god
[1:36:48] because brother branham said it's always
[1:36:50] in the will of god
[1:36:56] adventure often other things i can't say
[1:37:03] examples i just want to talk a little
[1:37:05] bit about examples
[1:37:07] of god's now this is a bible study this
[1:37:09] is allowed to go a little bit longer
[1:37:11] right
[1:37:14] all right those of you that you know
[1:37:16] don't like this idea
[1:37:19] you're you're welcome to leave but there
[1:37:21] may be someone that
[1:37:24] this is they love this
[1:37:29] there's different ways that god could
[1:37:30] speak to us and one way that we really
[1:37:32] enjoy
[1:37:33] is when god says i love you that he died
[1:37:36] for us that he's rich in mercy
[1:37:40] god loves us unconditionally
[1:37:44] but the same god that loves us
[1:37:45] conditionally un unconditionally loves
[1:37:47] our enemies
[1:37:50] and we do not mind hearing that god
[1:37:54] loves us and we're predestined we're
[1:37:56] we're we're
[1:37:57] part of the this message and we're gonna
[1:37:59] make a rapture
[1:38:00] and these are all wonderful things that
[1:38:02] we want to hear but that same
[1:38:04] voice says love your enemy
[1:38:08] that same voice says lay down your life
[1:38:10] for your brother
[1:38:12] your sister pray for them have a burden
[1:38:15] for them
[1:38:17] to go out look for my lost sheep
[1:38:20] to deny your will that same voice says
[1:38:23] deny your will
[1:38:26] and we've got to be willing to follow
[1:38:28] that
[1:38:29] as well as god is rich in mercy
[1:38:33] full of grace full of love for me we
[1:38:36] want to rejoice in all those things we
[1:38:38] want to say
[1:38:38] praise the lord well why don't we say
[1:38:42] praise the lord i'm going to live for my
[1:38:44] enemies i'm going to love man i'm going
[1:38:46] to bring
[1:38:46] shows in i'm going to die out i'm not
[1:38:48] going to do my will anymore praise the
[1:38:50] lord
[1:38:52] because it's still god's word it's still
[1:38:54] his voice
[1:38:56] see we begin to smorgasbord the message
[1:39:01] the service that's coming why we're
[1:39:04] going to say amen
[1:39:05] certain times to the word but not other
[1:39:08] times
[1:39:09] i like certain preachers but not as much
[1:39:12] as others
[1:39:16] the word is the word i'm thankful for
[1:39:19] god coming and loving me but that's all
[1:39:21] he did for me
[1:39:22] and he never said hey you got a chance
[1:39:25] to love me oh why do i do it lord how do
[1:39:26] i do it
[1:39:27] keep my commandments and i'm going to
[1:39:30] come and i'm going to speak them to you
[1:39:32] and i want you to read every day i want
[1:39:34] you to pray
[1:39:35] and i'm going to show you my
[1:39:36] commandments and as you do i'm going to
[1:39:37] quicken things to your heart and pretty
[1:39:39] soon you're going to get up and you know
[1:39:40] you're going to say you know what i
[1:39:41] can't just do what i want to do today
[1:39:42] because god spoke to me i got to go do
[1:39:44] this
[1:39:46] you're a chance to prove your love now
[1:39:48] for god
[1:39:51] so that voice goes beyond
[1:39:54] just how much god loves us cares for us
[1:39:58] it goes to a place i want you to be just
[1:40:00] like me you're my son you're my daughter
[1:40:01] i want you in my image i want you acting
[1:40:03] like me
[1:40:04] i want you being like me i want you
[1:40:05] washing one another's feet
[1:40:09] he's calling us to where we're not
[1:40:13] so of course it's uncomfortable of
[1:40:16] course it's going to seem like we're
[1:40:17] suffering of course it's not going to be
[1:40:18] enjoyable to our flesh
[1:40:20] but we don't believe in having sermons
[1:40:21] that are enjoyable to the flesh
[1:40:24] that'll never get us to heaven that'll
[1:40:27] make us feel
[1:40:27] good while we're down here on earth
[1:40:32] but it won't help us to get there
[1:40:40] turn with me if you would to joshua
[1:40:43] chapter one
[1:40:44] joshua chapter one
[1:40:50] you know we can sit in church and we can
[1:40:53] hear
[1:40:55] um uh
[1:40:59] scriptures being quoted and they may be
[1:41:03] scriptures like
[1:41:04] i'll never leave you i'll never forsake
[1:41:06] you in the palm of my hand
[1:41:09] um i'm with you and we can take those
[1:41:12] scriptures
[1:41:14] and we can apply them to
[1:41:18] only our selfish life
[1:41:24] like brother john what else would they
[1:41:26] be there for
[1:41:29] god don't only want us to be strong
[1:41:34] while we're going through our trials
[1:41:38] and courageous to
[1:41:41] to fight for what's ours
[1:41:45] but he wants us to be strong
[1:41:49] to follow all the word
[1:41:52] and it just depends how where we're at
[1:41:54] when we're listening to the word
[1:41:57] whether we're in the spirit or in our
[1:42:00] selfish nature
[1:42:03] joshua chapter 1 verse 7 only be thou
[1:42:06] strong and very courageous
[1:42:10] well that sounds encouraging right but
[1:42:13] he says that thou
[1:42:14] mayest observed to do all that i told
[1:42:17] you to do
[1:42:21] now that that's that takes courage
[1:42:25] come on now that that takes courage we
[1:42:27] got to go we got to go home and we got
[1:42:29] to get
[1:42:29] serious about being strong and be
[1:42:31] courageous to do all the word
[1:42:35] don't turn from the right hand to the
[1:42:36] left that thou mayest prosper
[1:42:38] whoever so thou goest this book of the
[1:42:41] law shall not depart
[1:42:42] out of thy mouth but thou shalt meditate
[1:42:43] about day and night that thou mayest
[1:42:45] observed to do
[1:42:46] all that is written therein amen for
[1:42:49] them thou shalt make the way thy way
[1:42:51] prosperous
[1:42:52] and then thou shalt have good success
[1:42:55] this
[1:42:55] word is important for your life
[1:42:59] i understand that those other things out
[1:43:02] there
[1:43:02] that is just between you and god are
[1:43:05] wonderful
[1:43:06] beautiful and i say praise god for them
[1:43:11] but god has called us to follow this
[1:43:13] word
[1:43:14] we need to put the emphasis on this more
[1:43:16] emphasis on this
[1:43:18] and then he says in verse 9 have not i
[1:43:22] commanded you be strong
[1:43:27] be of good courage be not afraid
[1:43:30] be thou not dismayed for the lord thy
[1:43:32] god is with you wheresoever thou goest
[1:43:34] and we can take that scripture and we
[1:43:36] can just apply it to our own
[1:43:38] life about the trial that we're going
[1:43:40] through with our neighbor because
[1:43:42] you know they put the weeds on our
[1:43:44] property and it bothered me and i got
[1:43:46] upset
[1:43:46] and i'm just going to go over there and
[1:43:48] be strong and courageous and i'm not
[1:43:50] going to let them do that anymore
[1:43:53] you know we can apply the word any way
[1:43:54] we want to
[1:43:56] but god wants us to get real strong
[1:43:58] about this word
[1:43:59] he wants us to wear this word live this
[1:44:01] word amen
[1:44:02] and not be satisfied with the word that
[1:44:04] we are living but get interested in the
[1:44:06] part of the word that we're not living
[1:44:08] when you read that bible look for what
[1:44:10] you're not doing look for the parts that
[1:44:12] he's wanting to bring us up in
[1:44:17] we're not robbers we're not thieves
[1:44:24] we've been born to serve god
[1:44:27] we've been born to serve his will to
[1:44:30] follow
[1:44:31] whatsoever things that he has commanded
[1:44:33] us
[1:44:34] jesus said all things whatsoever he has
[1:44:37] commanded
[1:44:38] that's what we're supposed to teach
[1:44:39] that's what we're supposed to follow
[1:44:41] we've been called to serve the lord
[1:44:45] we've been predestined we've been
[1:44:47] elected we've been chosen
[1:44:49] to fulfill god's will
[1:44:52] and this is more important
[1:44:57] to god that i do this
[1:45:01] then trusted two that i know that was of
[1:45:04] god
[1:45:06] that's right we need to put our emphasis
[1:45:10] here
[1:45:12] trusted too is going to fail god giveth
[1:45:16] god taketh away
[1:45:19] heaven earth's going to pass away but my
[1:45:21] word will never pass away
[1:45:23] we need to put the emphasis on what's
[1:45:25] important to god
[1:45:26] we've been born to do the will of god to
[1:45:30] follow his will which is written right
[1:45:32] here
[1:45:33] it's real easy if the bible says that
[1:45:35] that
[1:45:36] that we shouldn't we should gossip we
[1:45:38] shouldn't slander we should
[1:45:39] well israel simple we just don't do that
[1:45:44] and that's the voice of god speaking
[1:45:46] well you know maybe
[1:45:47] it didn't come to you personally like
[1:45:49] you did trust it too
[1:45:51] maybe it wasn't that personal but when
[1:45:54] you
[1:45:54] read it it needs to be that person
[1:45:58] because that's what god means it to you
[1:46:01] he doesn't have to speak everything to
[1:46:03] us personally out of this
[1:46:06] come on we're not all called to be
[1:46:10] malachi 4 5 and 6 there was only one we
[1:46:13] have to believe what he said
[1:46:15] we have to believe what jesus spoke
[1:46:18] and if we take it as if he spoke it just
[1:46:21] to us do you see what that does
[1:46:22] in your relationship with god that just
[1:46:25] that just takes
[1:46:26] god's heart and he's so full of love
[1:46:29] because it means something to you his
[1:46:31] word means something to you
[1:46:33] amen let's stand together thank you for
[1:46:35] your patience
[1:46:46] i say to the bride the groom wants us to
[1:46:49] unite with his word
[1:46:51] to unite with it not in a way of i'm
[1:46:54] more united i already said i would i
[1:46:56] know that
[1:46:57] i'm not talking about that i'm talking
[1:47:00] about getting interested
[1:47:01] to know his voice more if you read the
[1:47:03] word of god more you will hear the voice
[1:47:05] of god more
