pulpit um we all know what happened from few years back and for that matter nobody was allowed to travel but we thank god that everything seems over and the bible said that everything will pass away but the word of god will remain forever and so if the word of god is to remain forever then we are remaining forever hallelujah as god cannot pass away so we also as sons and daughters will surely not pass away amen so therefore um we thank god for your lives and uh for your prayers and your help and um as bro john have just said we are on missions uh back home but i'm reserving the report on sunday morning so god willing sunday morning if you want to hear come and hear all come and listen we have good news for you because the work is going on amen by your prayers and your health hallelujah so we want it to be on sunday morning so that we all assemble and just go through that amen uh before we read our scripture let me just say also that uh brah john gave me information of passing of our brother dan and uh we sincerely sympathize with you all okay um it's always sad when we hear news about loved ones like that um i was very very saddened when john called me and told me that radha because he was a brother that i used to when i come i most of the time was with him yeah so it was a shock to me when i had his person and painful as well so we say we sympathize with all of you and we ask our gracious god to keep you so in perfect peace amen well then let's go to business now we are reading acts chapter 3 um first of all um luke chapter 14. luke chapter 4 chapter 4 i'm sorry look yes luke chapter 4 we are reading verse 16. luke chapter 4 and also read acts chapter 3 verse 1 to 9. but first of all we are tackling luke chapter 4 verse 16. and he came to nazareth where he had been brought up and as his customers he went into the synagogue on the sabbath day and stood up for to read and there was delivered unto him the book of the prophet isaiah or isaiah and when he had opened the book of the prophet isaiah and when he had opened the book he found the place where it was written the spirit of the lord is upon me because he had anointed me to preach the gospel to the poor he had sent me to heal the brokenhearted to preach deliverance to the captives and recovering of sight to the blind to set a liberty them that are bruised to preach the acceptable year of the lord and he closed the book and he gave it again to the minister and sat down and the eyes of all them that were in the synagogue were fasting on him and he began to say unto them this day is this scripture fulfill in your ears and all bear him witness and wonder are the gracious words which proceeded out of his mouth and he said it's not this joseph let me take it again please and they said is not this joseph's son acts chapter 3 and verse one to nine now peter and john went up together into the temple at the hour of prayer being the ninth hour and certain man limb from his mother's womb was carried whom they laid daily at the gates of the temple which is called beautiful to ask arms of them that entered into the temple who seen peter and john about to go into the temple as an arm and peter fastened his eyes upon him with john said look on us and he gave it unto them expecting to receive something of them then peter said silver and gold have i known the such as i have give iv in the name of jesus christ of nazareth rise up and walk and he took him by the right hand and lifted him up and immediately his feet and ankle bones received strength and he limping up stood and walked and entered with them into the temple walking and limping and praising god and all the people saw him walking and praising god amen the lord had his blessing to the reading of his word amen please let's take our seed well tonight we want to look on this topic look on jesus look on jesus and now i believe strongly that our sons and daughters of god the only one we ought to look on is jesus there is no other one there is no other person we cannot look to ourselves we cannot look to any person any human being in our society or our environment we cannot look onto that person but jesus christ he is the only one that we should focus and look upon him because he is such that when people look on him they have their own ideas many people look on jesus and they don't see him to be god many people look on jesus and they think that he's just a religious leader a leader many people look on jesus especially like the pharisees at that time like the bible just said when he told them that this day this scripture is fulfilled they say is it not yourself son so they were looking on him as joseph's son amen hallelujah some look on jesus and they think that he was an illegitimate child but tonight we want to ask ourselves questions that when we look on jesus who do we see hallelujah so you see human beings have reached a position that every place there is confusion confusion everywhere and when you are in that state you don't have a stable mind so if we look on jesus and we cannot know who he is then that means there's confusion in our minds for example you got up in the morning or in the afternoon whatever in the evening you feel hungry but john you want to go and eat and you don't know what food to eat you don't know whether you should go for pizza or hamburger or chimichanga you are totally confused sometimes your appetite crave for all these and you cannot take all at once so therefore your your mind is going to shift from here to until you finally make your decision it means there is little confusion in your mind hallelujah but these people that jesus christ that day entered into the synagogue and the bible said that the book of isaiah was handed over to him to read amen it was a day that scripture was going to be fulfilled and beloved you agree with me that when god is fulfilling his scriptures he doesn't need anybody's advice he doesn't need anybody to get ready or not when the time comes for him to fulfill his word he fulfills it no matter how the people look on jesus christ no matter how they considered him to be that day a person that they were calling him an illegitimate child now we asked ourselves a question that why did they 100 the scroll to him to read because he was somebody that they did not respect he was somebody that the pharisees have ganked against him amen until you have told your members that nobody should even go and listen to him but that day in their midst they gave the book to him to read now after he read the scripture of isaiah chapter 61 the bible said that he gave the scroll back to the minister and all the people were looking on him now like how all of you are looking on me right now and he told them this day this scripture is fulfilled but they said and obey him witness and wanted at the gracious west which proceeded out of his mouth and they said it's not this joseph's son meaning they don't believe that he should be the one to proclaim that they look on him but they didn't see that he was a scripture who should come to fulfill that scripture they were looking on him and they saw him as joseph's son oh praise be the name of our god but whether they believe it or not a faithful scripture fulfilled that day he said d-day whether you believe it or not the scripture is fulfilled in your years and the bible says that they were so mad they gang up they held him they wanted to throw him into a ditch but by the power of god he passed through them and he went away this was a man who was born as a man but her no father has no mother according to the revelation that we have because we know that a woman cannot because uh you know take consumption without knowing the man and so the holy ghost said that mary what is in your womb is by the holy spirit [Music] until joseph himself the bible said that because he was afraid he wanted to leave that woman secretly and the holy ghost spoke to him he said joseph be not afraid to take that woman unto you but what is in her womb is by the holy spirit and so it was between god and mary he know that jesus christ was extraordinary born it was not a normal it was supernatural breath amen but yet the jews didn't see the quality that was in jesus christ they still saw him as joseph's son and after all this he left the scene that one day after they tried to throw him in the ditch and all that but there was a woman when he went to um samaria with his disciple one day and according to the bible accounts the disciples went to town to go and buy bread yes amen and so jesus christ was left alone seated by a world and a woman came around to fetch or to draw water then jesus said woman will you give me drink and the woman said well i am a samaritan and you are a jew we have nothing in common why then you asked me to give you water to drink then jesus said woman if you know the gift of god and the one that is standing before you you rather ask me of water and i'll give you water and you'll not come here again to draw hallelujah that beat the woman's mind that imagination is a what what kind of water are you going to give to me hallelujah let's read a little of that conversation um i think it's john chapter 4 yes okay john chapter 4 yes let me continue from the verse 10. he said jesus answered and said unto her if thou know was the gift of god and who is it that said to thee give me to drink thou with us have asked of me and he will have given me living water the woman said unto him say thou house he said thou has nothing to draw with and the world is deep from whence then has that living water are thou greater than our father jacob would give us the wealth and drunk thereof himself and his children and his cattle jesus answered and said unto her whosoever drinketh of this water shall test again but whosoever drinketh of the water that i shall give him shall never test but the water that i shall give him shall be in him a well of water springing up on into everlasting life the woman said unto him say give me this water that i test not not that come hither to draw jesus said unto her go call thy husband and come heather the woman answered and said i have no husband jesus said unto her thou has well said i have no husband for thou has had five husbands and he whom thou now has is not thy husband in that set down truly the woman said unto him say i perceive that thou art a prophet amen now you see the picture here is a woman who have never met jesus christ but that day once christ was communicating with her talking with them exchanging words with hair amen the woman was not just hearing the words were not just getting through her ears and passing through the other but the word of god or the weather proceeded out of god or jesus christ we're having some impact on that woman amen that's right amen that is what make man to make a decision whether to follow jesus or not hallelujah because the word of god does not come up from god for it to return to him void it must accomplish what it has been sent for so while the communication was going on like that then the woman said i perceive that you are the prophet yes now brother sister i want you to think about it right now jesus has been with the pharisees for a long time they hate him always they argue with him always they challenge him always but none of them perceive that he was a prophet but a woman that somebody called a prostitute amen a woman whom perhaps was not living a clear life that day when he heard the voice of jesus christ he said i perceive that you are a prophet so the woman was looking on jesus christ as such amen that's right amen verse 20 he said our fathers worship in this mountain and yes say that in jerusalem is the place where men ought to worship jesus said on your head woman believe me the hour cometh when ye shall another in this mountain not yet at jerusalem worship the father right yeah worship yeah no not yay worship ye know not what we know what we worship for salvation is of the jews but the hour cometh and now is when the truth worshipers shall worship the father and his spirit and in truth for the father secret side to worship him god is a spirit and they that worship him must worship him in spirit and truth you cannot worship god in flesh you cannot worship god by your mind you cannot worship god by your feelings you worship god by the word amen hallelujah you worship god by the word you're watching god by the spirit oh hallelujah verse the woman said unto him i know that the messiah cometh which is called christ when he is come he will tell us all things there's another step the woman was going to climb first of all he has noticed that this man that i'm talking with him he is nothing but a prophet now he she was challenging her faith once more after the prophet she knew that the messiah was going to come hallelujah amen amen jesus said i don't speak unto thee i am he and upon this came his disciples and marvel that he talked with the woman he had no man said what seeker dao or white turquoise die with her the woman then left her water pot and went away into the city and said to the men come see a man which told me all things that ever i did is not this the christ yes amen oh hallelujah it's not this the christ amen so the woman was waiting for a salvation and that was the day that her salvation was made manifested he said the man have told me of all that i have done is this not the christ so she was looking unto the coming of the christ so that her sins will be forgiving her but today people look on jesus christ and they still don't see who he is that's right that is what your sin is still remaining but when you look on jesus christ and you can see who he is and what he came for problems will roll away troubles will vanish hallelujah so it depends upon how you are looking on the lord jesus christ this woman said i perceive first of all you are the prophet and then later on he said that come and see my people yes amen perhaps he ran through all the phantom city and was calling people here and there come and see a man that i have seen is he not the messiah and what i love in this story was that after the people came and listened to the lord jesus christ they confessed and told the woman it's a woman not because you came to call us that is why we have believed but what we have had ourselves amen amen and amen many at times people will come face to face with the lord jesus christ even today as we live now you can present the message of this hour to people they will just take it and put it on your shelves tell them women should not be this they will tell you that those days are gone tell them that the church supposed to be this way they say those days are gone but is jesus christ gone hallelujah he said no i am with you always amen amen lord i am with you always but the system has been corrupted until people will look on jesus and they will not know who he is and the prophet said that spirits don't die amen so those spirits that came up from the pharisees is all over the world now as their pharisees look on jesus and they saw an elected mature they saw joseph's son they saw a belizeable the woman of the world saw the messiah amen the woman at the world saw the prophet the woman at the well saw the christ and the prophet asked us a question when we look on jesus today what do we see amen one day he was passing by somewhere also and there was a woman who had had an infirmity the bible said 12 years he has passed through so many uh what do we call them physicians that the problem will be solved but nobody could help this woman amen but that day when he saw jesus christ person he looked on jesus christ and he saw that he is a healer nobody advised the woman to do that he said but if i can touch the hem of his garment i'll be made whole so he touched the helm of the government of jesus christ and immediately the bible said immediately her trouble vanished and jesus christ himself felt the pool and began to ask peter somebody has touched me who has touched me hey peter said oh master a lot of people have let me touch you when we're on the way even here look at the trunks around you you say yes i know many people have touched me but they were ordinary touches but this particular one is a touch of faith because virtue has gone out of me whilst they were asking then the woman own up jesus look at the woman he's a woman your faith has set you free amen the faith that he had in her eyes to look on jesus if you look on jesus then where you make him to be that is how he'll appear to you if you look on him as your healer he'll heal you if you look at him as your problem solver he will solve your problem for you you if you see him as your redeemer he will redeem you he reviews him as your king's marriage he will redeem you whatever you look on jesus christ and you think of he has to accomplish that oh praise the name of our god amen and amen today you can also look on jesus christ and something supernatural will happen to your experience look at what the world is going through today confusion here confusion day the world is always you know a world system presidents and nations they are always calling for peace on this edge every nation america uh germany britain and russia oh they are calling for peace but what is the peace have them be able to bring the peace to the earth yes because they are talking about peace but they are not looking to the place of peace how can you settle or bring peace among the people when you don't have jesus christ in your life praise be the name of our god they have refused to look on the prince of peace how will they bring peace to the earth america don't have peace to offer germany don't have peace to offer ah britain don't have it right russia don't have it no nation on this side have peace to offer the only one that has the peace is the lord jesus christ and isaiah call him the prince of peace right from the walls the world war first and second and when this organization was started you know mounting up that they were trying to maintain peace in the world the western nations and the eastern nations they have tried and tried and tried and it came to a time they call it the cold war the war was still raging but it was cold it was not hot i don't know how many degrees but it was cold war until today we all know what has happened to the world now russia attacking ukraine and it has rather brought another problem today every government almost is complaining hardship in the country because of that war where is there peace where is their peace hallelujah and you see these have generated some fear even in some people but with christians we know where we are standing amen we know that russia indeed will have to do something right we know that russia will cause commotion because the prophet said that communism will not die said communism will crumble right from that time that he spoke about that he said communism will crumble and in 1989 1990 communism crumbled it disintegrated hallelujah but it's not dead because he said it's going to be a tool in god's hand to judge the but when he was elaborating the serving vision that you saw when he got to the seventh vision he said then after the seventh vision he had a blast boom behind him and he turned to look when he turned to look there was no nation again like america does that put fear in you does that put fear in you because you live in america you are living in america but you're not american you are christian hallelujah the holy spirit has come into christians yes are you catching it it has come into christians not americans if it's america every american will be baptized with the holy ghost but you are selected americans as children of god that is why you have the holy ghost and this is your blessed assurance and the prophet said that watch russia watch russia watch the king of the north that's always here when russia began to do things of this nature we have already been informed the prophet said no but when he was speaking that time he said that there is a bomb hanging in russia to blast this nation but this is the blessed assurance he said no bomb will land on this land this land that we are standing on right now he said no pump whether hydrogen whether nuclear weather can become whether whatever ballistic or bullistic or realistic whatever listic it will never land here until you you you you and me we are being raptured away why we are looking on jesus [Music] praise be the name of our god the wealthy look on him and they don't see nothing they will look on jesus and they don't see anything but you and i we look on jesus and we see the messiah like the woman of the world we look on jesus and we see our kinsmen redeemer we look on jesus and we see the place of peace we look on jesus and we see the father the son the holy ghost we look on jesus and we see the great almighty god hallelujah yes sir we look on jesus and we see our healer [Music] we look on jesus and our problems rode away amen amen amen amen he is the same yesterday today and forever and today as we speak beloved brother he is the one that we are talking about amen he read the scripture and he gave it to them they looked on him and he said this day this scripture is fulfilled but he said is it not joseph's son how can he make such a proclamation to you you see him as just have son oh brother sister like how you see me right now you see me as a ghanaian preacher oh no i am a preacher of the kingdom of god amen i look on you and i'll see you as american and see you as a child of god a child of the kingdom because we are all looking on jesus christ and that is the day that we are waiting for that this body will be changed because we are looking on jesus christ now when peter and john got to the gate and they saw that little man always begging for arms right the bible said i searched for what he said expected to receive something from them but peter and john told this man silver and gold that john we don't have for you but such as we have we are given to you in the name of jesus christ of nazareth rise and the man arose the man was not looking at the side but you look on peter and john but you see peter also knew that he was not standing there along with john amen he knew that jesus christ was standing by them hallelujah so peter didn't say look on me or look on john he said look on us and in the name of jesus christ he didn't say in the name of peter in the name of john no they were inviting the man to look on jesus [Music] and immediately the man who was born crippled got up on the street and shook himself and about he started jumping and he started limping and was praising god oh god will you look on jesus amen and amen and amen now let me quote this from the prophet okay if i would if you don't call the prophet we don't have any message so i always love to quote the prophet he said now some people when they look on jesus they look and see him as a church founder or church organizer or maybe a creed for a church that is what many people look to jesus to see he's just a new creed that was added to an old doctrine now many people look on and see him like that some look and see him as a myth santa claus or some of them look to him as some historical act that god did many years ago some of them looked to him yet as a baby in a manger oh god have mercy some still have their mind that jesus christ is still a baby in a basket god have mercy some also still look on him as the jesus christ is hanging on a cross some also still look on him and there are so many ideas and thoughts now but the question is what do you see when you look at him the prophet is asking me and you do you see the second person of trinity or do you see a trinity you only see him as you look at him through the weight that is the only way that you know it because he is the word he to reveal himself depends on what you are looking for it depends what you are looking for hallelujah if you are looking on jesus christ to see your redeemer he will be your redeemer if we are looking to jesus christ as the prince of peace he will be your place of peace if you are looking on jesus christ as your the almighty god he will be your almighty god why is it that people don't want still don't want to believe that he is the same god that met moses that met abraham that met noah and the rest who is jesus christ of they don't want to believe it because they are looking for something else hallelujah amen now look at cleopas okay now let me start it this way and now what we want to look at then if jesus has raised from the dead can we see him now there's only one way to to do and that is go and see what kind of a person we will look for if we're going tonight to see jesus if jesus were to be in front of tonight what type of a man will you look for what type of a man will you look for a man that has some uh some i don't know i don't know where to put it some golden golden you know suit on himself with gold issue perhaps with golden tie hallelujah is that the kind of jesus that you'd like to see praise the name of our god the prophet is asking what type of jesus would you like to see if he appear right now on the street of fountain our god is not asleep our god is not dead our god is our life in our soul amen and that is what makes us go and come with the same word of god will you go and look for some fellow that was way up in some great high cathedral with real priestly looking clothes would that be the kind of jesus you were looking for if it is he certainly changed since he was here on earth the last time for he dressed just like ordinary man he went in among men in and out among men and they didn't even know him because he looked so common like other men remember judas historians told the soldiers unless i betray him you would never know him amongst us so how i'm going to put i will just kiss him the one that i'll kiss he is the one he was so common among his people he was not so special and thank god we also are not special amen we are we can fit ourselves into all the society amen hallelujah we don't raise our hands our shoulders we don't puff up because the holy ghost humbles us the holy ghost humbles and we always want the holy ghost to handle us jesus said the pride he will crash away can i go on a little he drug just like ordinary man he went in among men in and out among men and they didn't even know him because he looked so common like other men there was nothing in him concupious about the lord jesus to look at him he will do a certain thing that is the only way they know him by his miracles and the signs that he did on the road from emmaus after his resurrection do you see it cleopas and his friend were working with him after his resurrection and he was so plain yet until they didn't recognize him until he did a certain thing like he used to do it before he was crucified he's the same yesterday today and forever he changed it not and that was what gave them the revelation can we imagine these people have been with jesus christ christ fed them christ gave them power to go and heal christ did so many things he lived with them so many years at least three and a half years and he promised them that he would die and the teddy he will resurrect amen they killed him he was buried that teddy he arose from the dead the woman went and saw an empty tomb right amen they rushed to the disciples peter and the rest and told them hey the master is risen indeed they didn't believe it himself didn't believe it that is why him and john run to the self-worker they wanted to go and see if he believed would you think he'll run there he didn't believe it so he ran he wanted to go and find out and when they went and they also saw an empty tomb the confusion became so great now amen they came back home confused they didn't know what to do they were talking and talking and talking the woman said we are telling you that the lord is risen but that doesn't mean that woman can preach anyway yeah when you go when you come to africa some of the women argues those women calling themselves pastors and evangelists whenever they want to argue they say yes but it's a woman that saw that empty tomb doesn't matter you can see an empty tomb but you are not given any power to preach hallelujah and so they were contemplating on this until it was late they have to you know disperse and it was by this that cleopas and the other man they were going to their village and they were talking so much confused talking about the resurrection the death and resurrection of jesus christ and how the woman has come to confuse them the more the women are telling the truth and you say they are confusing you and the bible says while they were going then all of a sudden they saw a man walking with them and the man asks them what are you discussing that you are so i mean broken-hearted and confused and then they asked him are you a stranger in phantom here oh yes i'm a stranger hallelujah is that you a sonja in jerusalem have you heard what has gone on these few days have you heard it a man called jesus very powerful man indeed a miracle worker a preacher with authority the one who could raise the dead he died and was buried and uh this morning some of our company have come to tell us that he he is risen and that is why we are so much confused and jesus look at them and say you fools this was a strong statement you fools you look on jesus and you don't see that he's jesus jesus said that you are full so so what can we tell the people who today look upon the message of this hour anybody that that throws the message of this hour away said i'll not believe that what can we tell that person jesus christ look on them and say that you're fools for not believing what the prophets have told you amen and today people can stand and challenge william brahm in your pulpit oh god have mercy they don't know what they are doing many a time we say they don't know what they are doing but sometimes we should tell them that they know what they are doing god have mercy he said don't you believe what the prophets have told you then jesus christ then started breaking the word right from the prophet of old till the time that they were communicating on the road to damascus i'm sorry emmaus and the bible say that he spoke the word and told them things and their heart oh yes their heart was bleeding to respond to the truth and then they got to the village then jesus according to the bible told them okay bye bye i am going to continue my journey they said no no no master the place is dangerous don't go come and pass the night with us and to uh when the day comes you can continue your journey wherever you want to go you say okay then they entered into their house fortunately for them food was ready and they asked for the food everybody like food you know i like it and you like it amen food was ready they set the table and can you imagine these people didn't know jesus because at that time they have not recognized whom he was but they asked him to bless the food why a stranger that you don't know you don't know his faith but they did that because of what they had from him they were so convinced that this man is someone that holds power bless the food for us to eat and the bible said that jesus christ bless the food the same way that he used to bless when he was yet with them so before they said amen their eyes opened and before their eyes got opened he vanished from among them and these men who were just a few minutes back telling jesus the area was dangerous for that matter he should not go they forgot about the danger and the road arose and they started running through the darkness they were going back to jerusalem to go and give the good news to peter and the rest that indeed the messiah is risen amen they look on jesus christ while he was preaching the word to them but their eyes were holding but when the word of amen came amen means let it be their eyes open somebody should look on the lord jesus tonight with an amen somebody should look on jesus right now with an amen amen and the eyes will open they went back to peter and the rest he said peter come and see the lord is indeed is ready for he has revealed himself to us today many people are confused many people don't know what to do but look he said look at cleopas and then after the resurrection jesus identified himself the way he broke that bread he did it just the way he did it before he was crucified and then that identified his characteristics because that is the way he did it now if he was here tonight how will he identify himself just like he did yesterday for he is the same today and it will be forever it is the identification today he will not be here in this body but he is here in the weight because the weight is manifested now we have a manifested weight i understand then we have a manifested word so if we are looking to jesus christ today we look on him in his word all the messages that the prophet came to preach now their titles were not just just west they were prophetic christ is the mystery of god revealed amen the thinking man's father the oddball spoken word is the original seat three kinds of believers what again the feast of trumpets and a whole lot standing in the gap leadership right indictment revelation of the serving seals amen oh brother sister we are blessed amen we are blessed that today when we look into the word of god we see jesus christ we don't just see a written word amen amen but we see jesus christ he said and that day you will know that i am in my father i in you and you in me and the prophet said what day he said today amen when the seals are opened because look when malachi 4 came into manifestation malachi 4 came to turn the heart of the children back to the fathers and the prophet said the revelation in the seven fields after it is open that is what literally turned the heart of the children back to the pentecostal fathers exactly so amen so beloved what we are doing right now we are not just plain tapes or i'm sorry we are not just reading letters but we are presenting jesus christ to the people in the message of this hour it is full in the text is full in the message books the reason why one day well i don't know your experience yet but one day i myself a pentecostal baby when i was thinking that when i speak in tongues i had the holy ghost and i spoke in tongues and i spoke in tongues but i couldn't live a christian life it was deception because others were doing it and you are forced also to do it because they have indoctrinated the people that if you don't speak in tongues you don't have the holy ghost so everybody was trying to do something and they respect you in the church when you do that but all was fake our deception until my pastor by then any time i remember that i said praise be to god one day he came to the church he said hey we have a new thing so what the new thing then he brought the messages say look this thing i found it some time back but i didn't believe it but this time i cannot hide it i am bringing it to you amen and pastor presented the message in the church and the church divided i wouldn't say into two because majority of the people left the church we were left with a handful of people in the church and my pastor gave me one particular message book that day he said daniel read this but john i said to the glory of god i read the book i didn't see anything so i went back into a pastor i've read the book by the i didn't see anything in there it's okay take this one go and read this one too and that message book was the thinking's man's filter oh brother when i opened the book and i was reading it i said what i felt something dropping into my soul then i started hearing myself saying amen amen amen and then i rushed to my past i said pastor anymore and from that day i saw jesus christ in his word i saw jesus christ in the written word and since from that day when i look on jesus i see my savior from that day when i look on jesus i see my redeemer from that day when i look on jesus i see the king of kings and the lord of lords from that day when i look on jesus i see my problems over and when i look on him today i see my victory hallelujah oh my brother my sister you can look on jesus christ right now and your life will change you can look on jesus christ right now and something will happen to your experience you can look on jesus christ right now because the world is almost coming to an end the world is confused even so-called pastors and ministers and churches they are all confused but praise be to god he has given us a blessed assurance and nothing shakes us because we know whom we are looking onto amen permit me to read my last quote so that we can close i hope i'm not taking too much time amen he is the same he was a prophet he was in them he was in the psalms he was in the history and he is the things to come the same yesterday today and forever hallelujah hebrews 3 8 if you are writing it down he should he should be the principal if that is what he is and we believe it don't we then if he is that then he should be the principal team of our talking anywhere you are talk about jesus anywhere you are talk about jesus if you are in your school talk about jesus if you are at home talk about jesus if you are in a restaurant talk about jesus if you are at your workplace talk about jesus hallelujah and amen and amen and amen let the world talk for him themselves but we will control to talk about jesus christ he should be the principal team of our life if he is the principal team of the bible and the bible is in us then he should be the principal team of everything that we do hallelujah all think should be christ anything we do our thing should be christ is that right and that's what the prophet asked here i said prof that is right we must always think about jesus we must always talk about jesus we must always eat jesus we must always drink jesus we must always sleep jesus when we get up from our bed it must be jesus any place that we do it must be jesus and jesus and jesus because if somebody could look on him and get their healing somebody could look on him and say i perceive that you are a prophet and from that day her prostitution sees he can do something to our life this time also blessed assurance jesus is mine o whatever force of glory divine error of salvation son of god oh yes lord this is my story oh this is my son praising my side we are all the day long this is my store read this oh yes lord praising my savior all day long perfect submission perfect delight visions of rapture now burst on my side oh yes lord angel descending bring from above of masses which pass of light oh hallelujah this is my soul my story my song [Music] is in my sake the out the day long this is my story this is nice oh yes lord praising my savior all day long perfect submission or is address oh i in my savior i'm happy and blessed watching and waiting looking about filled with this good [Music] this is my song [Music] this my song praising my savior [Music] all day long amen i love this song always when i think i felt something moving within me saying when he said he said vicious of rapture now has best on my side angels descending bringing from above echoes of mercy and which place of love jesus so loves us that is why he sent his angels to come and give us the visions of the rapture he sent paul he sent arenas he sent nothing he sent columba he sent martin luther he sent john wesley and he sent willian marion brown the angels that were in his right hand to come and give us the visions of the rapture and today we say praise be to his holy name we have the vision of the rupture and we are preparing to enter into it but we only do that when we keep looking on jesus god bless all of you god willing will continue on sunday let's bother our heads our lord and our king we thank you this evening and we bless your holy name father as it was on that day on the way to a mouse cleopas and his friend could not descend until the way and manner you dealt with them when you were blessing food while you were yelling with them you did it the same way and their eyes open to know you heavenly father we thank you in this our generation that the way and manner you reveal yourself to your sons and your daughters you have given us that quality also and we have known you to be our king the woman at the well saw you father and he realized that you were the christ the woman with the blood issue said no you are the healer today no matter what the pharisees look on you whether they call you joseph's son whether they call you berserboob what i'll call you a legend my child father we look on you and we see that you are our kinsmen redeemer we say receive the glory father we are praying lord have mercy on us lord jesus in this flesh there are so many things that war against us but our faith is anchored within the veil we pray therefore lord help us father any place that we fall short be merciful upon us continue to cleanse us and wash us further and put us our lord jesus on the scale and correct us day by day and night by night lord draw us closer today if you leave us our father will be wayward do not leave us at any time father even when we at fault have mercy upon us and draw us closer today we are waiting unto thee oh lord the utter and finish of our faith and as we know one of these days oh god this body is going to be changed and we'll sin no more granted father that when that day come o lord we will have favor in your presence thank you for my life thank you for the life of brother john and the entire church and lord will continue to ask your favor whatever we need to do to live the kingdom of god help us yes that your name will always be blessed as you gather us lord nice safety we pray lord lead us back home safely lord drive the vehicles remove every obstacle of the enemy and they trap the devil might have said on the way we destroy it in the name of jesus christ the father will take us back home lord we all lift our holy hands and say thank you our kin of kings and lord of lords in jesus christ and we pray amen john it reminded me of that centurion who quickly knew who jesus was as a healer and he looked to him for healer and wasn't interested in anything but just the opening of the word the speaking of the word and our hardest job is to not look at the veil that is where the word is coming forth from i think it's our hardest job when we come to church that we need to see the opening of the word to our hearts and the word is still a discerner you know we we may have not had five husbands but that word is still discerning what we are doing in our lives and it's easy if the preacher looks directly at you and and says you've got 682 dollars in your bank account you try taking 24 out today they wouldn't let you and that would be easy to say okay god spoke to me but it's not always like that but it god is still speaking to us we can't come to church and god not speak to us we just got to recognize him focus and be so glued to him speaking to us personally not so much collectively we may miss it in the show as it were but we want to hear god personally i appreciate that message today thank you very very much let's stand together and just think turn your eyes upon jesus and we'll sing a couple songs before we're dismissed it's wherever we're at tomorrow well
