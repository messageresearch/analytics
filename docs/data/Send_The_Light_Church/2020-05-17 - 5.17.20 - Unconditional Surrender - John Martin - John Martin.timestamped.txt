[4:00] out where the Bible tells us that this
[4:02] was the day that Noah entered in the ark

[4:14] had made for the protection of the elect

[16:09] of late but we know that there are needs
[16:14] in our lives and burdens and our heart
[16:19] prayer requests we have so let's just
[16:22] pray one for another what those needs
[16:23] are and all the unspoken
[16:27] that is just between us and the Lord God
[16:30] knows all about it
[16:31] God is able remember to continue to pray
[16:34] for brother Marty's brother-in-law Andy
[16:38] and that the Lord would just do a
[16:42] complete healing in his body come to
[16:45] norm as the great physician as well as

[17:45] have been praying for and let's just
[17:48] pray that our bodies build up such an
[17:50] immunity that we can get back to living
[17:55] normally I tell you I see things slowly
[17:58] a couple weeks
[17:59] when we were in Home Depot it's all the
[18:07] workers were the mass and and I would
[18:09] say maybe about 10% of the people didn't
[18:14] wear them when I was in there yesterday
[18:16] still all the workers had them I'd say
[18:18] it's about 50/50 or wearing them
[18:20] no not wearing them so you know part of
[18:24] it is you know people gaining confidence
[18:26] back and and then of course we don't
[18:29] know everything and things you know
[18:34] could still spread so we just need to
[18:35] pray that our bodies get built up with
[18:38] such an immunity no matter what let's
[18:40] pray for those that are helping the 60
[18:43] let's pray for our government our

[30:18] not by our power by our might but it's
[30:20] by the the Spirit of the Living God and
[30:22] this morning he sent in his word to do
[30:26] exceedingly above all that we could ask
[30:29] or even think his word is powerful let's
[30:33] just pray that word has preeminence in
[30:36] us and as we get ready to approach the
[30:38] word if we could see this little course
[30:39] teach us to number our days if we were
[30:41] on our deathbed I'm sure we would be

[31:06] to number our days

[32:42] Jesus would just bless you real good
[32:45] he's alive and well and capable of doing
[32:48] that amen amen
[32:51] turn with me if you would to the Book of
[32:53] Luke chapter 14 Luke chapter 14 verse 31
[33:00] we we want to talk about is as far as
[33:07] the subject how much does God expect out
[33:10] of our lives and it's something that we
[33:12] we think about every time that we're
[33:15] asked to do something of the Lord their
[33:18] flesh doesn't want to do it and and so
[33:22] there's this question that we have is
[33:25] how much does God expect out of our
[33:28] lives and we're going to try to get into
[33:29] that today Luke chapter 14 verse 31
[33:34] before we begin reading there if we
[33:36] could just ask God to anoint this word
[33:39] to our hearts amen Heavenly Father we
[33:42] thank you for this this precious word
[33:44] this dear to our heart where David said
[33:47] I hide it in my heart that are not sin
[33:49] against the Lord we love you we love
[33:54] your word God we want to grow in your
[34:00] word we want to grow have it drove
[34:03] richly inside of us and we want to love
[34:05] that word more with that we may keep
[34:08] that Commandments and we pray that this
[34:10] service would be a supernatural service
[34:13] for everyone that's listening today the
[34:16] Lord you would meet one-on-one with
[34:18] everyone
[34:19] their homes father lore that this word
[34:23] would become revealed and so personal
[34:28] that God they would know of a surely
[34:31] Lord what you have expected out of them
[34:35] Lord as we get into this this deep
[34:38] subject but yet large so simple pray
[34:42] that you just reveal yourself to us
[34:44] bless this word now Lord as we commit
[34:48] this service in the reading of these
[34:49] scriptures now into your hands for we

[36:03] unconditional surrender last fall in
[36:09] September of 2019 an and sister Jeanne
[36:16] went to Hawaii on vacation and on her
[36:21] second day there on the islands she went
[36:23] to Pearl Harbor and boarded the
[36:25] battleship the USS Missouri there on
[36:29] that flag ship of the Third Fleet she
[36:33] read the official document the
[36:34] instrument of surrender that was signed
[36:39] on September 2nd 1945 by July of 1945
[36:46] sixty-four Japanese cities had been
[36:49] largely or partially destroyed by
[36:52] conventional bombs during world war ii
[36:54] and were asked to surrender but they
[36:58] refused the following month on August
[37:02] 6th of 1945 the u.s. dropped an atomic
[37:07] bomb called the little boy bomb it was
[37:10] made of uranium on Hiroshima destroying
[37:15] over 60% of the developed city and
[37:18] killing between 70 and 80 thousand
[37:21] people because of the jet because of the
[37:25] Japanese refusing to accept surrender on
[37:28] July 26 of 1945 so they had a chance to
[37:32] surrender they were asked to surrender
[37:34] but they chose not to the New York Times
[37:39] said that that bomb at that time was
[37:43] equal to 20 tons of TNT Japan still
[37:48] refused to accept surrender and the
[37:52] terms of the Potsdam Declaration even
[37:55] after that first bomb just three days
[37:57] later the u.s. dropped a second atomic
[37:59] bomb it was called The Fatman it was
[38:01] made of plutonium it was more powerful
[38:03] and it was dropped on a city that
[38:07] manufactured weapons of destruction
[38:09] called Nagasaki and you have read about
[38:13] this in seen in history
[38:14] killing 40,000 more people with an
[38:18] additional 70,000 people dying from the
[38:22] aftermath just within four months today
[38:26] we have bombs that can produce three
[38:29] thousand times more damage think about
[38:33] that they're literally too big to use
[38:40] the US had plans for more atomic bombs
[38:44] but Japan wise
[38:46] Lee surrendered an early Sunday morning
[38:50] on September 2nd 1945 when the USS
[38:55] Missouri was docked in Tokyo Bay the
[38:59] Japanese delegation boarded the last
[39:02] battleship commissioned into the United
[39:04] States Navy to sign the instrument of
[39:08] surrender making the official ending of
[39:11] War World War two as most of us know a
[39:16] General Douglas MacArthur and nine
[39:19] Allied nations were represented there
[39:23] nozanne was reading this document when
[39:26] she was on vacation her attention
[39:30] drew to what caught her what caught her
[39:35] eye was these words unconditional
[39:38] surrender and these words I hope catch
[39:45] our attention this morning an
[39:49] unconditional surrender is a surrender
[39:52] in which no guarantees are given to the
[39:56] surrendering party when you
[40:00] unconditionally promise to surrender
[40:02] it's not limited by conditions it's an
[40:06] absolute surrender means to give oneself
[40:12] up to submit or yield oneself to the
[40:17] power of another what the Japanese had
[40:21] really feared was the destruction of the
[40:28] entire framework for rule that's what
[40:32] they wanted they wanted to rule and they
[40:36] didn't want to give up rule the ultimate
[40:40] is to surrender that rule to someone
[40:43] else without any say-so that's
[40:46] unconditional it's no different with any
[40:49] human being it is not in the human being
[40:53] in the nature of a man to want to give
[40:57] up or unconditionally surrender to
[41:00] will of God we were born with a very
[41:04] selfish spirit nature a complete
[41:08] self-centered will to the soul that
[41:12] hasn't been converted yet everything
[41:14] still evolves around them and you don't
[41:19] want to give that up you don't want to
[41:21] surrender that as it were to God
[41:25] Ephesians chapter 2 verse 3 sharing a
[41:29] little bit of that with us here among
[41:31] whom also we all notice that word all
[41:34] had our conversations in times past in
[41:37] the lusts of the flesh fulfilling the
[41:38] desires of the flesh and of the mind and
[41:41] Word by nature the children of Wrath
[41:44] even as others we just we didn't not
[41:48] only we did not want to surrender our
[41:50] will over to God we didn't even know God
[41:52] we didn't care about God we didn't want
[41:54] nothing to doing about God that was just
[41:56] the spirit in us and you know got time
[41:59] but if you want to write it down Romans
[42:00] 3 verses 11 through 18 everyone
[42:04] basically is just seeking their own will
[42:07] they're not seeking God's will but their
[42:09] own will an animal doesn't know its
[42:14] creator I want you to think about this
[42:16] for a little bit an animal doesn't know
[42:18] its creator sure it will discover who
[42:22] its mother is but not where its life
[42:25] came from and neither does an
[42:29] animalistic nature in humans know its
[42:31] creator humans eventually discover who
[42:35] their mother is but most never discover
[42:38] where their life came from thus never
[42:42] ever learning the reason further existed
[42:46] so that's why so many people they just
[42:47] can't seem to function they don't real
[42:50] have a real purpose in life Romans
[42:53] chapter 1 verse 25 tells us about a lot
[42:58] of these humans who worshiped and served
[43:01] the creature more than the Creator they
[43:04] they worship and serve the creation more
[43:07] than the Creator who is blessed for
[43:09] evermore amen they will look at the
[43:12] Grand Canyon and
[43:14] standing all at it they will spend hours
[43:18] staring at the ocean and be amazed at
[43:21] its beauty and the sound they will paint
[43:25] pictures and they will sing songs and
[43:27] there were write books about God's
[43:29] creation and never mentioned God in it
[43:36] it's a she don't want to give credit
[43:41] don't want acknowledge
[43:43] why is that Romans 1 verse 28 tells us
[43:46] that they did not like to retain God in
[43:49] their knowledge although talk about how
[43:54] pretty the birds sing how fast the
[43:58] hummingbirds wings move or how fast the
[44:00] cheetah can run on land did you know
[44:05] that a snail can sleep for three years
[44:11] how would you like to do the study on
[44:14] that one furthermore elephants are the
[44:20] only animals that can't jump
[44:24] it takes a sloth two weeks to digest his
[44:28] food
[44:29] I don't think humans could hold out that
[44:32] long did you know that that long net
[44:37] giraffe has no vocal cords how a black
[44:43] cow can eat green grass go through four
[44:46] stomachs and simply nearly 200 thousands
[44:49] of glass of white milk in a slave planet
[44:54] or know an octopus did you know that the
[44:57] octopus has three hearts did you know
[45:01] that most some of us know this probably
[45:03] that while dolphins are smart creatures
[45:05] that call each other by name and the
[45:11] probably more of us know that dogs have
[45:13] a sense of smell that's a hundred times
[45:16] a hundred thousand times stronger than
[45:20] humans think about that but they have
[45:24] just one sixth of our taste buds
[45:27] no wonder they put some of you
[45:28] in their mouth they say that the
[45:33] fingerprint of a koala bear are so
[45:37] indistinguishable from humans that on
[45:40] occasions they've been confused at a
[45:43] crime scene I just want to know who's
[45:47] been putting those little creatures in
[45:49] the database even God tells us to
[45:55] consider the ant that we can learn a lot
[45:58] people are so amazed at God's creation
[46:02] but many don't want to admit that there
[46:05] is a God who created everything they
[46:08] love to talk about it but they don't
[46:10] want to retain God in their thoughts in
[46:12] their minds if people possibly consider
[46:15] that was God that created them they
[46:16] would have to consider for themselves
[46:18] that they were created by God for our
[46:22] purpose and then they would have to
[46:23] answer to that God it's not in the
[46:28] nature of an animal to want to know
[46:31] their Creator and it's not in the the
[46:36] nature of humans that are born with that
[46:39] same humanistic animalistic nature to
[46:45] want to know its creator they were born
[46:48] in sin shape and iniquity Peter calls
[46:50] them natural brute beasts of course we
[46:56] know where we came from our natural seed
[46:59] with man's animalistic nature he simply
[47:03] doesn't want to know his creator that's
[47:07] why when you look back in your life and
[47:10] you were just out in the world just
[47:12] doing everything that you wanted God
[47:15] wasn't a part of your plan thank God he
[47:19] was we were a part of his amen Peter
[47:23] says walking after the flesh in the lust
[47:26] of uncleanness despised government's
[47:29] presumptuous are they self willed they
[47:32] are not afraid to speak evil of
[47:34] dignities people just lacked so much
[47:37] respect they don't even got respect for
[47:39] themselves
[47:41] an animal will not unconditionally
[47:45] surrender its will it has to be beaten
[47:49] or forced to that's why Jesus said we
[47:54] must be born again because he's not one
[47:56] about beating his will into us he's a
[47:59] gentleman in order for that experience
[48:03] to happen for our nature to change we
[48:05] must surrender to God unconditionally
[48:09] like the lamb unconditionally surrenders
[48:12] its whoa to the shears like the Lamb of
[48:16] God he was led to the slaughter of
[48:19] Calvary Jesus unconditionally
[48:23] surrendered his will to the Father
[48:26] remember when he was asking for his will
[48:29] for the cup if the cup could pass him
[48:32] and he wouldn't have to go through this
[48:33] way of suffering and he prayed that
[48:36] three times it was important to his
[48:39] flesh his flesh just didn't wanna have
[48:43] to suffer us like ours he understands
[48:47] what we're going through
[48:48] but he ended his heart and his prayer by
[48:51] saying not my will but thine be done
[48:54] he unconditionally surrendered for this
[48:58] purpose he came to the earth Paul was
[49:03] led to the slaughter many times over and
[49:05] over and we've read it many times he was
[49:08] stoned and whipped and so many things
[49:11] was done to him he unconditionally
[49:17] surrendered he said though I I'd be free
[49:19] from all men I make myself a servant
[49:23] Jesus I must show how many things he
[49:26] must suffer for my namesake must Jesus
[49:30] bear the cross alone no there's a cross
[49:34] for all of us Paul unconditionally
[49:37] surrendered his will to Jesus a certain
[49:41] prophet named Agabus in Acts chapter 21
[49:45] verse number 11 next 21 verse 11 and
[49:50] when he was come unto us he took Paul's
[49:53] girdle
[49:54] and bound his own hands and feet and
[49:56] said thus saith the Holy Ghost so shall
[49:59] the Jews at Jerusalem bind the man that
[50:01] oneth this girdle and shall deliver him
[50:03] into the hands of the Gentiles and when
[50:05] they heard these things both we and they
[50:08] that were of that place besought him not
[50:11] to go up to Jerusalem but noticed it was
[50:14] the Holy Ghost that told him and the
[50:17] natural part of these believers were
[50:20] trying to tell him not to go but Paul
[50:24] answered what mean ye to weep and to
[50:27] break my heart for I am ready not to be
[50:30] bound only but also to diet Jerusalem
[50:34] for the name of the Lord Jesus Christ
[50:36] Paul had unconditionally surrendered to
[50:42] the Lord Jesus Christ and when he would
[50:45] not be persuaded we ceased saying though
[50:50] well the Lord be done amen
[50:54] unconditionally started thank God for
[50:56] Paul thank God for leaders that are
[50:58] enough not willing to to quit hey man
[51:02] but they unconditionally surrender amen
[51:06] what an example for us to follow Japan
[51:10] had a will to blow up Pearl Harbor the
[51:12] u.s. had a will to blow up Japan and
[51:16] they were blown into pieces Japan still
[51:20] had a will to destroy us but they
[51:24] unconditionally surrendered it to the
[51:26] will the u.s. did you know that the
[51:33] majority of the people accept Jesus
[51:37] Christ as their personal Savior
[51:38] do not unconditionally surrender their
[51:43] lives
[51:53] they don't unconditionally surrender it
[51:57] I would say that the majority that
[52:04] people do need about that it's a
[52:07] requirement let's look at some some
[52:14] scriptures of common salvation that are
[52:17] often used by believers in Romans
[52:24] chapter 10 verse number nine just
[52:29] appreciate your prayers that God would
[52:31] help us to better receive Oh to get what
[52:37] God has for us today into better to
[52:39] receive it amen Romans chapter 10 verse
[52:42] 9 just some some scriptures here that
[52:44] talk about salvation let's just see if
[52:46] they talk about an unconditional
[52:48] surrender okay Romans chapter 10 verse 9
[52:51] that if thou shalt confess with thy
[52:53] mouth the Lord Jesus and shalt believe
[52:54] in my heart that gotta raise him from
[52:57] the dead thou shalt be saved for with
[53:00] the heart the man believeth unto
[53:02] righteousness and with the mouth
[53:03] confession is made unto salvation so
[53:06] right there and I read that to the to
[53:08] the natural mind I don't see anything
[53:10] about an unconditional surrender I just
[53:12] see you just got to confess with your
[53:13] mouth you've got to believe with your
[53:14] heart and you're gonna be saved I don't
[53:16] see anything there about unconditional
[53:18] surrender Ephesians chapter 2 verse 4
[53:20] but God who is rich in mercy for his
[53:24] great love wherewith he loved us for
[53:27] when we were dead in sins have quickened
[53:30] us together with Christ by grace ye are
[53:33] saved and he continues in verse eight
[53:36] for by grace are you saved through faith
[53:39] and it's not of yourselves it is the
[53:42] gift of God so here we see it's it's
[53:46] grace that saves us we just have to
[53:48] believe again just through faith and
[53:49] it's a gift so I don't see anything here
[53:52] about unconditional surrender these
[53:55] scriptures are often used look at Romans
[53:57] chapter 5 verse 18
[54:01] therefore as by the offence of one
[54:04] judgement of by the offence of one and
[54:09] that was Adam judgment came upon all men
[54:15] to condemnation even so by the
[54:18] righteousness of one Jesus Christ the
[54:21] free gift came upon all men unto
[54:25] justification look at that
[54:26] the free gift it just came upon all men
[54:29] for as by one man's disobedience many
[54:34] were made sinners right we didn't have
[54:36] anything to do with it and Adams
[54:40] disobedience we were born sinners so by
[54:44] the obedience of one so many be made
[54:48] righteous I mean I in these scriptures
[54:50] here I don't see anything about having
[54:53] to surrender unconditionally surrender
[54:56] to God I mean God is he's awesome God he
[54:58] blesses us he gives us life look at mark
[55:03] 16 verse 16 he that believeth and is
[55:07] baptized shall be saved he that
[55:09] believeth not shall be damned so it
[55:11] looks like here you just gotta believe
[55:14] believe X 15 verse 11 but we believe but
[55:21] we believe through the grace of our Lord
[55:23] Jesus Christ we shall be saved
[55:26] another scripture nothing about having
[55:30] to surrender your will to God
[55:32] unconditionally next chapter 16 verse 31
[55:38] when a guard at a prison as Paul and
[55:43] Silas sirs what must we do to be saved
[55:50] they said believe on the Lord Jesus
[55:53] Christ and thou shalt be saved in thy
[55:55] house that's Acts chapter 16 verse 31
[55:59] believe on the Lord Jesus Christ and
[56:01] thou shalt be saved and thy house now to
[56:07] the natural mind none of these
[56:10] scriptures refer to a need of an
[56:12] unconditional surrender to
[56:14] but they're often used in the scriptures
[56:16] and often used which makes us to think
[56:23] in the natural way does God really
[56:27] require an unconditional surrender do we
[56:31] really need that old-time religion that
[56:35] how fire-and-brimstone preaching now I
[56:40] don't have anything negative at all to
[56:43] say about these scriptures but I do want
[56:45] to ask the question do we have the right
[56:49] interpretation of them do we have a
[56:51] complete understanding what it means to
[56:54] receive this gift and to believe John
[56:59] chapter 7 verse 38 Jesus seen here he
[57:02] that believeth on me as the Scriptures
[57:04] have said out of his belly shall flow
[57:06] rivers of living water so we have to
[57:09] believe not in a personal way our own
[57:12] personal interpretation but we have to
[57:17] believe as the scripture teaches us to
[57:18] believe everybody's got a different view
[57:22] of belief we're concerned about the one
[57:27] that Jesus spoke of and it it takes
[57:31] we need revelation amen we need true
[57:35] revelation what are the rest of the
[57:39] Scriptures have to say about this
[57:40] because Jesus told us in John 5:39 to
[57:45] search the Scriptures for in them you
[57:48] think you have eternal life but the
[57:52] Scriptures are really what testify of
[57:55] him not what we think not how we
[57:58] interpret believing they're not
[58:00] testifying
[58:01] it's the scriptures that testify 2nd
[58:06] Timothy chapter 3 verse 15 the Holy
[58:10] Scriptures are able to make thee wise
[58:13] unto salvation through faith that's what
[58:16] Paul told Timothy which is in Christ
[58:18] Jesus the Scriptures are able to make
[58:22] thee wise unto salvation think about
[58:25] that pause I had to do is just believe
[58:28] why do I need the rest of the scriptures
[58:30] all Scripture is given by the
[58:34] inspiration of God and is profitable for
[58:38] doctrine for reproof for correction for
[58:40] for correction remember that for
[58:43] instruction and righteousness that the
[58:44] man of God may be perfect thoroughly
[58:46] furnished unto all good works
[58:49] we need to hunger and thirst for the
[58:53] inspiration of God that we may catch the
[58:57] real meaning of this this morning knowdo
[59:03] chapter 1 verse 5 so I will therefore
[59:08] put you in remembrance though he wants
[59:10] know knew these things how that the Lord
[59:12] having saved the people of the land of
[59:14] Egypt afterwards destroyed them that
[59:16] believed not so one time the children of
[59:21] Israel believed and were saved but
[59:27] because they did not continue to walk in
[59:33] more truth that God had given them God
[59:38] destroyed them and this little part
[59:42] right here really makes me to to
[59:46] understand God's nature a little bit
[59:49] more now that's not just good enough to
[59:52] start the race with God hey Ben but
[59:55] Jesus's own words as he that endureth to
[59:57] the end the same shall be saved now
[59:59] between the time you start and the time
[1:00:02] that it ends guarantee God's going to
[1:00:04] give you more truth to walk in he is not
[1:00:06] going to let you sit around and and just
[1:00:09] hang on to Jesus went to Calvary and
[1:00:13] paid the price for you and that's all
[1:00:14] you got to think about no God has
[1:00:17] something more in mind for you and he
[1:00:20] promised when he knew that her carnal
[1:00:23] nature couldn't take it has how many
[1:00:26] face to set up to you but you can't bear
[1:00:28] it now but after the Holy Ghost comes
[1:00:31] upon you he will lead and guide you into
[1:00:34] what all true all true so we need a
[1:00:39] hunger for all the truth
[1:00:43] there is a continuing on that God
[1:00:49] requires of every believer
[1:00:51] God wants an unconditional surrender
[1:00:55] from us he's not interested in man's
[1:01:00] surrendering with a condition means I
[1:01:05] could talk to you just a second most of
[1:01:08] you have heard about my carnal agreement
[1:01:13] that I had with the Lord when I before I
[1:01:17] gave my heart to God I told God that I
[1:01:19] would give my heart to him under one
[1:01:23] condition
[1:01:24] that he would he would give me Cheryl it
[1:01:32] was a condition of surrender and I'm so
[1:01:40] glad that God didn't allow that to
[1:01:43] happen
[1:01:44] before I made a decision I am NOT gonna
[1:01:50] marry Cheryl or do anything until God
[1:01:54] tells me and I gave my heart to Jesus
[1:01:56] Christ an unconditional surrender and
[1:02:01] then it isn't like we can call the shots
[1:02:04] with God you know it isn't like we have
[1:02:07] more men then we got 20,000 he's already
[1:02:10] got ten and isn't like we've got more
[1:02:13] power than him Luke chapter 14 verse 25
[1:02:20] just kind of going back to her or
[1:02:24] opening scripture here a little bit
[1:02:26] before now take a look at this just
[1:02:30] painting the picture here there was a
[1:02:31] great multitude of people with him
[1:02:35] multitudes what multitude is 2,000 and
[1:02:38] there were multitude so there is a quite
[1:02:40] a great multitude with him almost like
[1:02:43] might say a Coliseum maybe in some
[1:02:48] auditorium like a ballpark or an arena
[1:02:53] or some baseball football there
[1:02:55] just a lot of people with him and
[1:03:00] instead of just trying to get them all
[1:03:03] to just you know you boys just follow me
[1:03:08] you just you know everything's going to
[1:03:09] be okay
[1:03:11] the Bible says in verse six that he
[1:03:16] turned to them and he said unto them if
[1:03:19] any man come to me and hate not his
[1:03:24] father and mother and wife and children
[1:03:28] and brothers and sisters yay and his old
[1:03:35] life he cannot be my disciple Wow
[1:03:41] now these are scriptures that are not
[1:03:45] often read in churches I'm just being
[1:03:48] guarantee of that you know Jesus wasn't
[1:03:56] afraid that the majority of the
[1:03:58] multitude would leave because of only
[1:04:02] having a natural understanding their
[1:04:04] carnal understanding of that but I just
[1:04:08] want you to see in the scripture God
[1:04:10] wants us to totally surrender our
[1:04:13] greatest love unconditionally over to
[1:04:16] him over to the will of God he doesn't
[1:04:18] want us to put anything before God even
[1:04:21] our own lives and we know him this time
[1:04:24] that we're living in that men are in
[1:04:26] love with themselves they're so in love
[1:04:28] with themselves but we have to surrender
[1:04:34] it over to him or we can't even be his
[1:04:35] disciple now we can be our own claimed
[1:04:37] disciple of Jesus but he won't claim you
[1:04:40] and to be honest with you I can't force
[1:04:43] myself to go in the rapture ain't bigger
[1:04:46] than him he's the one that's going to
[1:04:49] have to claim me verse 27 and whosoever
[1:04:56] does not bear his cross and come after
[1:04:58] me he cannot be my disciple say you
[1:05:03] can't love anybody not even your family
[1:05:08] of
[1:05:09] god you can't love your life and on top
[1:05:15] of it you got to bear your cross before
[1:05:21] you can even even come after God or else
[1:05:26] you cannot be his disciple think about
[1:05:30] it most jesus bear the cross alone no
[1:05:35] was it just Calvary here Jesus is
[1:05:41] talking about the cross that we need to
[1:05:45] carry now that word bear means to live
[1:05:49] to carry up to take up to endure declare
[1:05:52] sustain or to receive so we need to to
[1:05:57] lift up and bear that cross that word
[1:06:00] cross figuratively it is a stake a post
[1:06:04] a pole but what it really represents is
[1:06:07] an exposure to death that is self-denial
[1:06:13] example that is the atonement of Christ
[1:06:15] where Jesus he gave the ultimate gave
[1:06:20] his own life he died physically for you
[1:06:24] and now we have to die out calmly for
[1:06:28] him he wants us to die out
[1:06:31] currently for him we have to deny our
[1:06:34] will to do what we want to do just in
[1:06:39] order to surrender to him it's not a
[1:06:41] physical death but death to yourself to
[1:06:46] the ruling of your heart and of your
[1:06:50] will and of your life most jesus bear
[1:06:55] the cross alone sounds like jesus is
[1:06:57] requiring more than himself to bear
[1:06:59] cross here we've got to we've got to by
[1:07:06] our own will surrender our self to the
[1:07:13] Lord Jesus Christ
[1:07:17] by our own will pick up the cross and
[1:07:21] follow him by our own choosing suffer by
[1:07:29] not giving our own flesh what we want
[1:07:32] and then we can follow him and fulfill
[1:07:36] his purpose
[1:07:39] when I was at Home Depot there was
[1:07:46] someone standing in line as I was
[1:07:49] picking up some Shepherd hooks for well
[1:07:54] my wife who had a few extra baskets of
[1:07:58] flowers that she wanted hung and the
[1:08:01] person that was standing in front of me
[1:08:03] had a t-shirt on and on the back of that
[1:08:06] t-shirt it said I'm and I'm an American
[1:08:12] by birth but I'm a patriot by choice so
[1:08:20] in other words he was born in a a
[1:08:24] country that fought for liberty and
[1:08:28] somebody had thought about the future
[1:08:31] and they fought for that Liberty and so
[1:08:35] he was born into the the blessings of
[1:08:38] the Liberty that this nation has but he
[1:08:42] is declaring that he's making a choice
[1:08:46] about wanting to support and defend this
[1:08:54] country as a patron now we were born
[1:08:58] into this world we didn't even know that
[1:09:00] Jesus died for us 2,000 years ago so we
[1:09:05] were born with this knowledge that for
[1:09:09] God so loved us that He gave His only
[1:09:12] begotten Son I tell you there's a lot of
[1:09:15] Christians out there are a lot of
[1:09:17] believers out there I should say that a
[1:09:19] real that are not real patriarchs that
[1:09:23] really don't defend the gospel that
[1:09:25] don't support the gospel who are not
[1:09:28] willing to pick up the cross
[1:09:30] that Jesus gave them and to follow him
[1:09:32] not allowed to say today you are
[1:09:35] children of the patriarch Abraham Amen
[1:09:39] we're Patriots for God we're ambassadors
[1:09:43] for Christ amen
[1:09:45] and he's called us to pick up the cross
[1:09:49] to follow him not some fun easy way to
[1:09:54] be a Christian that isn't the story that
[1:09:57] Jesus painted for us now that's the
[1:10:00] story that the most subtle beasts
[1:10:03] painted for Eve still painting it today
[1:10:06] in fact is so nice of a painting that
[1:10:09] kicked Jesus out of the church and
[1:10:11] they're having church their way the fun
[1:10:14] way with entertainment and the lights
[1:10:16] and the joking and everything so fun but
[1:10:20] they're ready they're ready not a
[1:10:22] patriot for the gospel amen they're
[1:10:25] trying to pick and choose what they want
[1:10:27] to take out of the scriptures and it's a
[1:10:29] it's a conditional surrender to God and
[1:10:32] still saying their surrender their life
[1:10:34] to God but it's conditional god help us
[1:10:40] just surrender all that we have now
[1:10:45] Jesus takes this important statement he
[1:10:47] begins to teach us he leaves us with a
[1:10:50] better understanding that it's not he
[1:10:52] that starts the race but he that
[1:10:54] finishes it here in verse 28 for which
[1:10:58] of you intending to build a tower
[1:11:00] sitteth not down first and counted the
[1:11:03] cost whether he has sufficient to finish
[1:11:05] it less happily after you have laid the
[1:11:12] foundation he's not able to finish it
[1:11:16] and all that behold it began to mock him
[1:11:19] saying this man began to build and was
[1:11:24] not able to finish if we don't finish
[1:11:29] building what we started with God we
[1:11:33] will be the ones that are being mocked
[1:11:41] galatians chapter 6 verse 7 be not
[1:11:44] deceived God is not mocked for who serve
[1:11:46] for whatsoever a man soweth that shall
[1:11:48] he also reap for he that soweth to the
[1:11:51] flesh shall weep to the flesh reap to
[1:11:54] the flesh but he that soweth to the
[1:11:56] spirit shall of the Spirit reap
[1:11:58] everlasting life amen
[1:12:01] we gotta keep sowing to the spear and I
[1:12:04] know it's how are we got to keep denying
[1:12:06] the flesh but the Bible says in verse 9
[1:12:08] and let us not be weary in well-doing
[1:12:11] for a new season we shall reap if we
[1:12:14] faint not
[1:12:17] now remember going to and I was going to
[1:12:21] church in Selene I remember driving by
[1:12:31] and seen a house that had started to get
[1:12:36] built and never really finished
[1:12:39] I just year after year to go by and the
[1:12:43] house was still there and I began to
[1:12:45] wonder this man started with a purpose
[1:12:48] to invest this money put all this labor
[1:12:51] but he didn't have enough to finish it I
[1:12:54] thought you know so sad
[1:12:57] kind of like me with the water fall out
[1:12:59] there you know he started about I
[1:13:01] haven't finished it and a lot of
[1:13:04] Christians a lot of believers when they
[1:13:06] come to Christ are interested in making
[1:13:09] sure their their sins are forgiven they
[1:13:11] just want God cleanse me I believe in
[1:13:13] the blood of justification not realizing
[1:13:18] it's not about finding a way to get rid
[1:13:20] of your sins that's not what it's about
[1:13:21] God is interested in a relationship he
[1:13:24] wants to build his church in you he
[1:13:26] wants to build you up to the statue of a
[1:13:28] prevent he launched his character in you
[1:13:30] and that requires a lot of building a
[1:13:33] lot of labor you got to finish what
[1:13:36] started amen God hasn't expected end for
[1:13:40] us amen amen we got to keep going we got
[1:13:43] to sit down and consider what is going
[1:13:46] to cost us to see if we have what it
[1:13:48] takes to be a real disciple of Christ
[1:13:52] that's what he's ready
[1:13:53] here do we have enough to be a real
[1:13:56] disciple it ain't good enough to be
[1:13:58] self-proclaimed a lot of people they
[1:13:59] self-proclaim like crazy what they are
[1:14:03] in other words to a real believer all
[1:14:07] you have to do is look at the life look
[1:14:10] at the fruit and you you know all right
[1:14:17] let's continue on Luke 14 verse 31 as
[1:14:21] waiting for an to finish her knows but
[1:14:23] she is writing away this morning or what
[1:14:26] King got to make war against another
[1:14:29] king in sitteth not down first and
[1:14:32] consulted whether he be able with ten
[1:14:36] thousand to meet him they cometh against
[1:14:39] him what twenty thousand or while or
[1:14:44] else while the other is yet afar a great
[1:14:47] way off he sent us an ambassadors in
[1:14:50] desiring conditions of peace I think
[1:14:56] Japan should have considered that before
[1:15:00] they entered the war he should have sat
[1:15:04] down and considered it and it goes to
[1:15:08] show you how a lot of times human nature
[1:15:11] can be deceived believers can be
[1:15:16] deceived we cannot overcome the power of
[1:15:21] God's will with our feeble animalistic
[1:15:25] self-centered will of ours he's got what
[1:15:30] it takes to annihilate us to smithereens
[1:15:33] he's got an atomic bomb that can blow us
[1:15:36] out of the bits and that's his word and
[1:15:40] his word declares that we need to
[1:15:44] unconditionally surrender our will to
[1:15:46] his well he's a great way off
[1:15:50] we better humbly approach him with a
[1:15:54] desire for a peaceable condition nothing
[1:15:57] short of an unconditional surrender will
[1:16:02] God accept
[1:16:04] nothing first 33 so likewise who soever
[1:16:11] he be of you that for saketh not all
[1:16:18] that he have he cannot be my disciple
[1:16:23] all of our will all of our desire it
[1:16:29] sounds like to me that God is requiring
[1:16:32] an unconditional surrender and if we
[1:16:36] truly believe the scriptures that
[1:16:41] testify of Jesus we can see clearly what
[1:16:45] it means to believe if we understand the
[1:16:51] gift that God gave at Calvary he didn't
[1:16:54] have to come down and provide a way for
[1:16:57] the Holy Ghost to come upon us that was
[1:17:00] freely given but just because he went to
[1:17:03] Calvary doesn't mean the whole world's
[1:17:06] going free Jesus concludes here typing
[1:17:11] our condition our condition our
[1:17:16] conditional surrender with salt that was
[1:17:21] good at the beginning but later it lost
[1:17:25] and became useless to God salt is good
[1:17:32] but if the salt have lost his Savior
[1:17:34] where what shall be salted it is neither
[1:17:36] fit for the land nor yet for the
[1:17:39] dunghill but men cast it out he that
[1:17:44] have ears let him hear Jesus not telling
[1:17:48] us a little story about some men that
[1:17:51] just tossed some salt out the dent
[1:17:54] wasn't working anymore God has no use
[1:17:56] for a conditional surrender either did
[1:18:01] the US with the Japanese and that's what
[1:18:05] was written there unconditional
[1:18:08] surrender to many believers surrender
[1:18:11] their lives to God conditionally
[1:18:16] they just don't realize it until later
[1:18:19] when God tells them to do
[1:18:21] more than they thought at the beginning
[1:18:29] they begin to rationalize what's
[1:18:32] important do I really have to do this I
[1:18:35] mean as long as I do this this is more
[1:18:39] important
[1:18:40] this can slide and they begin to develop
[1:18:43] this mindset that they've got to be
[1:18:47] intelligent and smart enough to figure
[1:18:49] out what they have to do what they don't
[1:18:51] have to do and just being so humble just
[1:18:55] to surrender everything to God if the
[1:19:00] Cross requires too much suffering for
[1:19:02] them too much humility too much laying
[1:19:04] down their lives too much repenting then
[1:19:07] they put a condition in it while holding
[1:19:10] on that they're still bribed that's the
[1:19:16] spirit that can creep around in the
[1:19:19] message I'm so special that I don't need
[1:19:25] to surrender everything because I'm
[1:19:27] still bright I'd like to read a quote
[1:19:32] for the message the day on Calvary I
[1:19:35] want to recommend everybody get this
[1:19:39] quote and study it it was preached in
[1:19:43] 1960 all 925 so it'd be September 25th
[1:19:49] that day in Calvary I want you to listen
[1:19:54] carefully to this quote look what that
[1:19:59] day on Calvary did to you it paid your
[1:20:04] price it settled the question your sins
[1:20:08] be as scarlet they shall be white as
[1:20:10] snow red like crimson white like wool
[1:20:15] then you have no sin you are perfectly
[1:20:19] sinless no matter what you've done or
[1:20:23] what you do you're still sinless as long
[1:20:28] as you've accepted Jesus Christ as your
[1:20:31] Savior your sins are forgiven
[1:20:34] anything is forgiven is remitted and
[1:20:37] forgotten about its it's a done deal
[1:20:41] praise praise God Calvary paid the price
[1:20:44] amen but look what he says then what
[1:20:51] does it do
[1:20:52] he says what does it do what do you mean
[1:20:54] what does it do it paid the price for
[1:20:56] all all my sins no it don't stop there
[1:20:59] what does it do
[1:21:01] he asked the question it gives up after
[1:21:05] that condition his spirit to follow him
[1:21:08] and to do as he did for others who is
[1:21:16] following on see if you follow on your
[1:21:18] gonna be his disciple now you're gonna
[1:21:20] do as he did he was just one man
[1:21:25] the perfect man He gave His life and he
[1:21:28] made an example for you now what must we
[1:21:33] do another question so he's he's
[1:21:35] preparing us now the first thing I want
[1:21:41] to say is Jesus never lived for himself
[1:21:47] that's forsaking all his life was spent
[1:21:53] for others no brother and laying that
[1:21:55] foundation this is what we need to be
[1:21:58] doing that's perfectly eternal life
[1:22:03] brother and says now I know y'all got
[1:22:06] jobs you all got free time and we all
[1:22:15] need a wind down kind of like clear out
[1:22:20] our heads but we can take that so far
[1:22:26] that they become excuses of living for
[1:22:29] others and I'll tell you sure we all
[1:22:33] know each our life isn't froze but we
[1:22:35] need a revelation of what that really
[1:22:36] means just like we need a revelation of
[1:22:39] what it means to to forsake all
[1:22:45] you know it's gotten so carnal that
[1:22:47] people think living for other sisters
[1:22:49] doing things for people when you say you
[1:22:55] go to church and you do good things
[1:22:58] that's fine but if you live your life to
[1:23:05] yourself you haven't eternal life now
[1:23:10] there is no way in the world I could
[1:23:13] ever say those words but you know what
[1:23:17] the Prophet did and he's he's the seer
[1:23:22] of God it's this message that breaks
[1:23:26] down what the word says this is so
[1:23:32] important for all of us st. to really
[1:23:33] really check where is our desires are we
[1:23:38] are we making excuses for everything
[1:23:42] that we're doing with our time is there
[1:23:44] a burden do we even have a burden to see
[1:23:47] Souls saved are we just thinking about
[1:23:51] what my job is in in the future I mean
[1:23:57] for a man of God for the Prophet to tell
[1:24:01] me that if I am living for myself that I
[1:24:06] don't have eternal life nothing about
[1:24:11] well all you got to do is believe I mean
[1:24:14] sure the Prophet said that sure he
[1:24:15] courted those same scriptures but what
[1:24:19] does it really mean to believe what is
[1:24:22] it really mean to forsake all if you
[1:24:24] forsake everything you're no longer
[1:24:27] living for yourself you're living for
[1:24:28] there is nothing else to live for if
[1:24:30] you're not living for yourself but when
[1:24:36] you live life when you live your life to
[1:24:39] yourself you have an eternal life
[1:24:42] eternal life is living for others it
[1:24:45] proved it when you come to the Lamb of
[1:24:47] God in other words we too have to lay
[1:24:50] down our lives someone said how can you
[1:24:55] stand
[1:24:55] brother Brandon let anybody call you
[1:24:59] such bad names he said you don't live
[1:25:06] for yourself you live for others that
[1:25:10] you might redeem that man
[1:25:13] now how you're gonna redeem that man
[1:25:15] Alice Christ gonna better be seen if you
[1:25:18] don't allow that evil to come up in your
[1:25:22] life and be spoken about you that's when
[1:25:28] there's an opera it's wrong but then
[1:25:30] there's the opportunity for the life of
[1:25:32] Christ to to come forth the love of God
[1:25:35] to redeem that man but if you're just
[1:25:37] judging oh that's wrong I ain't gonna
[1:25:38] talk to you anymore
[1:25:39] I'm cutting you off what is that let me
[1:25:43] enter like that's a humanistic animal
[1:25:45] nature but the random said you live for
[1:25:52] others that you might redeem that man
[1:25:54] you become sons amen and the trouble of
[1:26:00] it is the church has forgotten they were
[1:26:03] sons oh they don't they don't mind
[1:26:05] saying oh yeah I was the Son of God even
[1:26:08] when I was in sin I was a seed of God
[1:26:11] they don't mind saying I'm Brian no
[1:26:13] matter what but they forgot to live like
[1:26:16] a son they forget to conduct themselves
[1:26:19] that they have someone follow the other
[1:26:23] side he's the king of kings in the Lord
[1:26:26] of lords
[1:26:30] we don't want to forget we're supposed
[1:26:33] to act like a son we're a son he said
[1:26:36] brother and says you're taking Christ
[1:26:38] place as a son your son so don't live
[1:26:43] for yourself live for others sons of God
[1:26:48] live for others what is that saying what
[1:26:55] are you saying
[1:26:55] you're being pretty strong pretty bold
[1:26:57] well hey I'm not here telling who's in
[1:27:01] and who's out what I am trying to do is
[1:27:04] draw your attention to this word and
[1:27:07] then this
[1:27:08] unconditional surrender that the Lord
[1:27:10] Jesus wants from your life and it would
[1:27:12] behoove us to take time to sit down and
[1:27:14] consider the call us what God is wanting
[1:27:17] out of our lives instead of just when
[1:27:19] church is over we just go ahead and do
[1:27:21] the same old thing let the Holy Ghost
[1:27:26] speak to you hey man heart not your
[1:27:29] heart is in the day for let the Holy
[1:27:31] Ghost
[1:27:32] squeeze your heart and cause you to
[1:27:34] surrender more of yourself to God things
[1:27:39] can creep into our life Saints it's not
[1:27:41] about proving who's holier than now it's
[1:27:45] about laying down your life and not even
[1:27:47] being anything in this kind of other
[1:27:48] people just give yourself your Son of
[1:27:51] God do you live for others amen he said
[1:27:56] you look on towards Calvary as your son
[1:27:58] you're looking to Calvary in other words
[1:28:01] Jesus laid down his life I'm a son of
[1:28:03] God I have to lay down my life it's a
[1:28:06] different understanding than what most
[1:28:08] churches teach no listen these words he
[1:28:12] says I hope this helps you to get in a
[1:28:16] place in other words brother I am
[1:28:20] speaking here they're not in place he's
[1:28:24] wanting this to get them in place that's
[1:28:27] what the tabernacle that's what all
[1:28:30] people has got to do is find out what
[1:28:35] you are and what's the purpose don't
[1:28:41] just say I'm the child of God
[1:28:43] don't just keep you know claiming you're
[1:28:47] a child just to have that feeling of
[1:28:51] being a child but now come to maturity
[1:28:54] with that being a child become
[1:28:56] manifested when I was a child I put away
[1:28:59] childish things but when I became a man
[1:29:01] I acted like a man I began to to love
[1:29:05] like my father a man the love that
[1:29:08] endures all things
[1:29:10] amen the love of God that covers things
[1:29:14] that that loves us said to me and
[1:29:17] because we were his child and we're
[1:29:19] maturing
[1:29:22] that's who we are Church isn't going to
[1:29:28] church just to play music just to sing
[1:29:32] songs church is a place were correction
[1:29:37] judgment begins at the house of God
[1:29:40] brother Brad says we must reckon
[1:29:43] ourselves dead and alive to Christ then
[1:29:48] he made the way that we could sacrifice
[1:29:51] ourselves for his service you know we
[1:29:55] can't do that in our flesh though but
[1:30:00] why I'll tell you what the Holy Ghost is
[1:30:02] in you to do the same thing you did when
[1:30:03] it was in Jesus surrendered his will to
[1:30:07] the Father he said if we follow him we
[1:30:11] lead the life that he lived if we follow
[1:30:17] him we lead the life that live that's
[1:30:20] wonderfully exactly what Jesus said when
[1:30:24] he was telling us no man can come after
[1:30:28] him unless we pick up our cross lay down
[1:30:31] our life deny our will and then we
[1:30:35] follow him we lead the same life that he
[1:30:37] led us exactly what the Prophet was
[1:30:39] saying Luke chapter chapter 9 verse 22 I
[1:30:43] just like try to go through this real
[1:30:45] quick I know we're getting down here
[1:30:47] Luke chapter 9 verse 22 and the Son of
[1:30:50] man must suffer many things and be
[1:30:53] rejected to the outers in the chief
[1:30:54] priests and the scribes and be slain and
[1:30:56] be raised again the third day in verse
[1:30:59] 23 and now notice this is not a
[1:31:01] different subject but he's he's teaching
[1:31:07] his disciples that as he suffered
[1:31:09] they're gonna have to suffer that's what
[1:31:12] he's teaching them and he tells them
[1:31:15] that you're not gonna be able to follow
[1:31:18] him unless you do and he said to them
[1:31:21] all If any man will come after me let
[1:31:23] him deny himself take up his cross on a
[1:31:27] daily basis and follow me
[1:31:31] that's an unconditional surrender right
[1:31:34] there
[1:31:35] that's what it means to unconditionally
[1:31:38] surrender your life to Jesus Christ your
[1:31:40] will every day for whoever will save his
[1:31:44] life shall lose it that's what happens
[1:31:48] it's Japan they tried to save their life
[1:31:50] they lost it but whosoever will lose his
[1:31:53] life for my sake the same shall save it
[1:31:55] I tell you I think Japan would have been
[1:31:57] annihilated they had more bombs
[1:32:00] hey you you already kept blowing them up
[1:32:03] but you know what they sought to lose
[1:32:07] their life that they might save and we
[1:32:13] have Japan today the way to save your
[1:32:18] soul to save yourself is to lose your
[1:32:27] will to God just surrender
[1:32:33] unconditionally over to him for what is
[1:32:36] a man advantage if he gain the whole
[1:32:39] world lose himself be a castaway for
[1:32:43] whosoever shall be ashamed of me in my
[1:32:44] words of him shall the Son of Man be
[1:32:47] ashamed when he shall come in his own
[1:32:51] glory and his father's and the Holy
[1:32:53] Angels we don't want to be ashamed of
[1:32:57] this word this word that we heard today
[1:32:59] about unconditionally surrender is that
[1:33:02] a popular subject but I'm going to tell
[1:33:05] you it's not about going to church and
[1:33:07] here hearing a popular subject or
[1:33:09] hearing something that's that we enjoy
[1:33:14] hearing more I guess my whole heart from
[1:33:19] ever ever ever preach earnest never left
[1:33:21] me has never been about helping people
[1:33:26] to feel more comfortable because I
[1:33:29] thought there was a problem with the
[1:33:31] ministry not making people feel
[1:33:34] comfortable it's not that I'm not
[1:33:39] worried about what I look like how much
[1:33:41] I fail I'm not concerned about how many
[1:33:45] people
[1:33:47] would want to listen to me honestly but
[1:33:51] when I stand before the Lord in the
[1:33:53] midst of all my failures I know the
[1:33:56] heart of God wants a relationship with
[1:33:58] every one of you and I feel like I'm at
[1:34:03] the defense and the support of helping
[1:34:08] that relationship be developed by
[1:34:13] sharing the heart of God with you and
[1:34:16] not let the enemy trip you up to make
[1:34:19] you think well Calvary done you did law
[1:34:22] we're pretty well set we can just go on
[1:34:24] and live our lives no God has a greater
[1:34:26] purpose for you than that and we got to
[1:34:28] die out before that purpose can be
[1:34:30] fulfilled turn with me to Psalms 23 now
[1:34:37] so often I've been to many funerals in
[1:34:40] my life and the psalm is often read
[1:34:44] referring to a natural death and that
[1:34:49] it's it's like a it's like a tunnel that
[1:34:53] we go through to the other side doesn't
[1:34:55] work but I really believe with all my
[1:35:02] heart not to do anything against that
[1:35:04] but I really believe that this is this
[1:35:08] Psalm is for those who go through a
[1:35:11] spiritual death does this this means
[1:35:16] everything to the believer who's living
[1:35:20] and is going through self-denial and and
[1:35:23] the crucifying of his flesh look at the
[1:35:25] very first verse the Lord is my shepherd
[1:35:28] I shall not want
[1:35:30] well you think we're gonna have to worry
[1:35:32] about that one or on the other side
[1:35:34] after we die this is the first thing
[1:35:39] that we're going through in our self
[1:35:42] crucifixion our self-denial Paul said
[1:35:46] I've learned whatever stayed on their
[1:35:48] wit to be contempt so the Lord is my
[1:35:51] shepherd I shall not want
[1:35:54] I forfeited my will to God's
[1:35:59] he maketh me to lie down in green
[1:36:02] pastures he leadeth me beside still one
[1:36:05] he restoreth that's how our soul gets
[1:36:08] restored a man our soul never be
[1:36:11] restored by going to church and figuring
[1:36:14] out God learning all the mysteries of
[1:36:16] what the Prophet meant here and coming
[1:36:18] in here and getting all this knowledge
[1:36:20] your soul will never get restored with
[1:36:22] that you need to die out you need to let
[1:36:25] the Holy Ghost come in and have its way
[1:36:27] let him lead you beside the still waters
[1:36:31] let him lay it down in green pastures
[1:36:34] let him lead you in paths of
[1:36:36] righteousness for his name's sake he's
[1:36:40] trying to restore your soul that's the
[1:36:43] reason that is the reason we have to die
[1:36:47] out that's the importance of it though I
[1:36:52] walk through the valley of the shadow of
[1:36:56] death I'll tell you another thing about
[1:36:59] this your your soul don't get restored
[1:37:02] when you die the tree falls that's the
[1:37:05] way lies this is for the spiritual death
[1:37:08] yea though I walk through the valley of
[1:37:11] the show it doesn't seem like that when
[1:37:12] you got to give up your will just like
[1:37:15] you feel like you're you're dying out to
[1:37:17] what you wanted to but look at the faith
[1:37:21] the relationship that David had with God
[1:37:23] I will fear no evil for thou art with me
[1:37:29] thy rod and thy staff they comfort me do
[1:37:35] you know it's not only we need God's
[1:37:38] Word to lean upon but we need the rod of
[1:37:41] Correction - that gets us in line it's
[1:37:47] all love don't let your mind be carnal
[1:37:51] and try it you think that the preachers
[1:37:54] trying to force you in a tube to make
[1:37:56] you try to do something you don't want
[1:37:57] to do no we got a surrender willingly to
[1:38:03] God an unconditional surrender and when
[1:38:07] you surrender and you're not wanting
[1:38:10] your you're walking through a valley of
[1:38:12] shadow
[1:38:13] death and fears all around you but you
[1:38:16] know what I will fear no evil look what
[1:38:20] he says here they'll prepare us a table
[1:38:25] before me in the presence of my enemies
[1:38:29] you know when you begin to die out you
[1:38:32] recognize who your enemy is
[1:38:34] it becomes more aware that the enemy is
[1:38:37] right here inside of you and God begins
[1:38:42] to prepare a table right inside of your
[1:38:48] heart a man the Word of God becomes open
[1:38:51] and fresh and real to you and the devil
[1:38:54] can't do nothing about it
[1:38:56] amen right in the presence of the enemy
[1:39:01] God comes in and he noise your head with
[1:39:05] oil and get your cup to run over he
[1:39:10] gives you spiritual food in due season
[1:39:12] amen and look at this surely goodness
[1:39:16] and mercy shall follow me amen all the
[1:39:20] days of my life and I will dwell in the
[1:39:22] house of the Lord forever and then if
[1:39:26] you continue to walk a self Crucified
[1:39:30] life every single day I can say of a
[1:39:33] surety surely goodness and mercy shall
[1:39:36] follow you all the days of your life
[1:39:38] amen
[1:39:40] God will bless you God will be your
[1:39:45] strength God will be your portion he
[1:39:47] will be your buckler he will be the
[1:39:50] answer to every situation he will be
[1:39:53] your peace and then because you've set
[1:39:56] your love upon him he will deliver you
[1:39:59] amen right in the presence of your
[1:40:01] enemies this very important topic of
[1:40:08] just surrendering unconditionally to the
[1:40:13] Lord Jesus Christ may God bless you
[1:40:17] today and may God bless you tomorrow and
[1:40:21] each day that this word unfolds more and
[1:40:25] more to you such a small
[1:40:27] simple topic but yet so deep and so
[1:40:29] important God he's still calling us for
[1:40:34] an unconditional surrender even as he
[1:40:36] did the first day that he called you let
[1:40:39] him have his way as you surrender your
[1:40:42] will and your heart over to him amen
[1:40:45] let's stand together so how much does
[1:40:51] God expect out of me an unconditional
[1:40:56] surrender just sign on the dotted line
[1:41:03] he wants you he's he's calling you for a
[1:41:08] purpose greater than where we're at
[1:41:11] today I can say that of her shirt and
[1:41:13] God is always not just pulling us higher
[1:41:15] but he has an higher expectation out of
[1:41:18] us and so often we forget the real
[1:41:20] important subject of just surrendering
[1:41:24] surrendering that God's character can be
[1:41:27] Memphis that his love his peace his joy
[1:41:30] so he laid our life and let the whole
[1:41:32] world know that Jesus is alive in us
[1:41:35] amen amen
[1:41:38] let's just bow our hearts in a word of
[1:41:40] Prayer our dear gracious father we thank
[1:41:45] you for Calvary thank you for loving us
[1:41:50] when we didn't know you we didn't care
[1:41:53] about you in fact we acted so against
[1:41:56] you
[1:41:58] we were aliens but you for the joy that
[1:42:03] was set before you you endured the cross
[1:42:07] you endured the suffering and it was so
[1:42:12] real that you wanted the cup to pass
[1:42:14] from you but he surrendered
[1:42:17] unconditionally to the Father and not my
[1:42:19] will but thine be done and today Lord
[1:42:23] the book has been open our ears have
[1:42:27] heard what the Spirit is saying to us
[1:42:29] the church that you're calling us for
[1:42:33] that same unconditional surrender back
[1:42:36] to you to pick up our cross to follow
[1:42:39] you
[1:42:40] to deny our will Lord I pray for every
[1:42:45] believer for every heart perhaps there
