brethren by the mercies of god that if present your body is a living sacrifice holy acceptable unto god which is your reasonable service and be not confirmed to this world but be transformed by the renewing of your mind that he may prove what is good and acceptable and perfect will of god you may be seated may god bless you this morning i'm so thankful to god that god allowed me to come to this country after three years you know it's been a tough time this last three years we all know because of the kobe you know and well if we are here today it's by the grace of god god still wants us to do his will you know and i think you know the day our work is finished we will not be here even for a second you know and um if you are here we are here by the grace of god and you know as the lord says you know the word of god says in the eyes of men and in the eyes of god so we need prayers you know and we sure appreciate your love and your prayers i miss brother john this morning here and i just texted him a message i said i miss you already and i don't know if brother john is listening online but he will definitely know you know but uh i really miss him you know it's it's something always you know when you have a pastor of the local church present with you it's easy for the uh you know for the guest pastor you know for the guest preacher you know but i'm home you know and i would like to congratulate you all and also congratulate brother john and the family for the beautiful church you know yeah i've been in the uh place where they would rent you know and it is such a good good place you know a sunday school as well as you know a pastor's room and a prayer room and a quiet room and it's beautiful you know and so few of you know me and many of you i see new faces and you don't know me but i would like to introduce myself to you i'm brother boaz son of brother prakash you know many of you might know brother prakash and we miss him a lot my dad passed away on the december 6th of 2020 not because of the covet but just 40 days in 40 days we came to know that he had cancer in the liver and it was four stage you know and we couldn't do anything and we tried to do our best to take him to the hospitals and do some treatments but at the end of the you know 15 20 days he said don't take me anywhere i know my time has come you know and as i said you know when our time is finished you know and nobody can stop you know and he died in in my hands and in in in front of me and i saw the you know the the pulse coming down from 94 down to zero and he opened his eyes in front of me and you know he just gave his last breath and but before he passed away he called me and my brother and he said don't stop the work which i have carried for 55 years and it's tough you know this morning i also lost one of my closest associate minister this morning you know india time you know u.s time three o'clock in the morning and i got a phone call so it's tough when you lose some of your dear ones you know but we have a great uh hope that we will meet them we will see them you know we'll see all our dear ones you know and he's been a great missionary you know yeah my dad has been a great missionary you know and we built 109 churches you know for the poor ministers and you know raised many orphans boys and girls you know many of them are preachers you know many of them are standing for the lord you know and in the in the nation of india it's not easy to you know raise uh anybody you know and we feed more than 550 mouths every day three times you know and that's all by the grace of god you know nothing nothing great about us you know as the bible says in as much as you have done unto the least of these my brethrens you have done it unto me so we are just trying to fulfill what matthew 25 40 44 talks about you know james 1 27 you know and so it's the grace of god it's been tough you know because since the kobe uh the lack of support you know without the support you know we can't go far you know and so remember the ministry in india in your prayers since january 1 baptized 172 people you know and it's it's the it's the greatest achievement you know in spite of kobe you know yeah this is the world we are living in where all the mouths are shut you know eyes are open you know no shaking of hands no hugging no you know no close you know no fellowship but thank god you know that we could still have meetings and revival is going on people are hungry for the word of god you know people are hungry for the message you know and that's how we could you know reach out to the unrich people you know and and without the grace of god without your prayers and without your support you know i don't think we can obtain we can go far you know as we have gone far till now you know so continue to uplift us in your prayers you know we live in a very you know it's a the prophet of god said we live in a golden age you know but we still are in such a dangerous age you know that where we need to uh see uh the state we are in today you know we need to see the situation the position we are in today you know and i mean when i say we need to see our state or our position our situation means i want to talk about you know spiritually you know you know physically you know we have our own heartaches our battles you know and and so we are spiritually you know every day is a battle for us you know you know and i i was just i had another message all together prepared you know um last night you know but but after i uh got the news of the death of my associate minister you know suddenly the lord brought me to this you know that we need to move on you know we can't stop in one place the problem today is when we stop you know you know it doesn't matter what fallen state we are it doesn't matter how many times we fall but it all matters are we rising up or not and we need to rise up from our situation you know you know that's what paul is speaking about you know you know by the mercies of god we need to present our bodies as a living sacrifice which is holy acceptable unto god and which is original sacrifice you know service you know we don't do any uh you know we are not doing anything to god you know you know god is doing everything for us you know you know we need to be grateful or thankful to what god is doing for us you know you know you know how we can be a living sacrifice how we can move on in our lives you know you know how we can you know be a blessing to god to people you know when we renew our mind you know the prophet said you know the people are in such a state that they are losing their minds you know people are becoming insane you know and this is the this is the time we are that we need to be careful of every step every move we make today you know you know and how can we renew our mind is solely by the word of god you know you know and when we renew our mind every day when we dedicate our ourselves to god every day you know that will prove and that is acceptable and it's the perfect will of god we are all born natural how many of you believe we are all natural you know you know you were all born you know by the curse of sin you know and you know because of the sin because of the fall in the garden of eden you know death came in you know in in in the garden of eden you know they were born natural you know but thank god you know they was covered spiritual you know you know you know after sin the fallen aid and glory of god left them amen you know they were covered in sin you know and sin makes us decrease our spiritual life you know to natural life you know you know we were born natural you know but when we are you know born again you know when we are when we are accepted christ when we are baptized when we are filled with the holy ghost you know we are no more natural we are no more carnal you know we are spiritual you know and we can't stay there you know we can't stay in our natural state we can't stay there we can't stop you know we might fall we might fail but we can't stop we need to move on amen and that's what god wants us don't stop no matter what circumstances comes in your life maybe no matter how many bigger storms rages in your life come over you know we need to move on we need to move on from from natural to spiritual from spiritual to supernatural if we don't move on to supernatural then we are in trouble you know you know we are spirit being and it was the original design of god that we need to be filled with the spirit and the satan always perverts that you know right when we came with our body we came also with the spirit you know what makes the natural man is the spirit body and the mind you know and you might say brother how can a natural being become a spiritual being what makes you spiritual you know coming to church no giving tights and offerings no praying singing dancing no the prophet said there is only one qualification to be spiritual from natural is hunger for god's word that's the only qualification today that we can be spiritually you know moving on you know from natural to supernatural is hunger for the word of god that's the only qualification it doesn't matter whatever background is today it doesn't matter what our generation was and is you know right it's sinful the whole world is sinful you know you know but when we try to move on when we try to hunger for the word of god that is the only place that god takes you know interest in our lives and he will try to see that he will give strength to move on you know the problem today is church has become very churchy you know church has become too religious you know right you know you know if you have a broken spirit and a willing heart that's what god needs you know god almighty can use any one of you he can use any one of the children here you know you know i'm happy when i see the children writing notes you know you know that's true you know maybe they are the tomorrow's preachers you know they are the tomorrow's backbones for the ministry for the church for the family you know you know that's why you know even the word of god is told strictly to the parents train up a child in a way they should go you know i thank god for my father and my mother you know you know being a land of 33 million gods and goddesses you know not one not two 33 millions gods and goddesses all dead i can't stand and say this in india they will kill me that's true brothers you know i cannot even say jesus is the only god and living god you know but i can boldly stand here and stay say in the land of america that 33 million gods and goddess is all dead but i am so happy that i serve a living god jesus christ the same yesterday today and forever he was the word he is the word and always be the word you know that word manifested in the flesh all we need today is a broken heart all we need is a willingness a willing heart to serve him you know if you're not willing you know you can't come and sit here you know if you can't if you're not willing to serve god you can't practice songs at home you know you have so many other things to do but why you are doing so much so many things is to please god why you are here is not only to benefit of your soul you know hunger for the word of god but it is to please god how can we please god by faith how faith comes by hearing the word of god and that's the only qualification today for the living church for the church of the living god that we need to hunger for the word of god he's not looking for the ability he's looking for the availability you know many people today they don't have time you know to come to the house of god and listen to the word of god they have time for everything but they don't have time for god and i think this is the time that we need to come closer to god you know in the united time and sign he says we need more prayer meetings we need more fellowship you know you know the the greatest connection between god and man today is the fellowship with god his word and his people we need revelation today and if we need revelation today more of the revelation today we need to unlearn religion in our life religion is coming you know you know sister sue was telling me about you know she did not take the vaccine brother bill's wife you know no she said because she did not take you know the vaccine they said you can't work here but she saw that many of the people they started taking vaccine you know you know i want to tell you we can't bring religion between you and god religion will not help us you know and if we need revelation we need to unlearn the religion what religion has taught us thank god for calvary thank god for jesus christ he has paid the price for us the prize was paid once for all amen fasting doesn't help us amen no fasting helps us but fasting doesn't help god i was testing you you know fasting helps us fasting doesn't help god fasting is not paying for sins doing good is not paying for sins goodness is the fruit not the root sometimes we say oh our good works will save us no our good works will not save us you know religion will teach us to do good to find already what is found no revelation no life amen that's right if we don't have the revelation of the word of god we can't move on spiritually we can't move on supernaturally you know thank god for jesus christ what he did on calvary hebrews 10 14 says for one by one offering he had perfected forever them that are sanctified if we do not grow spiritually then we are growing religiously and if you don't check it then from spiritually you will become religiously and religion will make us carnal amen and carnal mind is a demon's food many times most of the people today and all our lives we have lived that life you know born again on sunday and gone again on monday that's true we have we have lived that cycle unknowingly knowingly we have lived all our life born again on sunday gone again from monday to saturday that's why i said the church has become too churchy again gone again you know but in supernatural the supernatural 56 he says i thought of a parable there he said my sheep know my voice a stranger they will not follow the sheep was born under the tutorship of this shepherd he learns that voice he will never pay attention to anybody's else voice he learns that shepherd's voice another shepherd might call they might do whatever they want to but there's some little something about that shepherd that the sheep recognizes see that's the way it is with god's sheep strange voices it just don't sound right they just don't go that's all if sheep can be tempted but when it finds out that it's a wrong shepherd it will turn away and here come a shepherd down the street walking walking along he's talking about india you know and behind him a string of sheep a city block long and them sheep walking right by that produce and things that wouldn't turn right or left they kept their eyes on the shepherd moving right on through oh god what a shepherd means not look right or left not be tempted by this or that but walk in the footsteps of the shepherd hallelujah not only god has given us a shepherd in this house but there is a great shepherd too know a mighty shepherd a chief shepherd which god has given you know and he talks about you know while he was traveling in that british jeep riding he says there was a shepherd had a whole lot of animals upon a hill and he was feeding them they were leading them and taking them places and in there he had sheep in there he had goats mules camels everything he was feeding them all they were all grazing the shepherds was watching them i said my shepherd here means many thing he said a shepherd is a grazier you know he said you know a strange thing he says when the night comes you watch said all the sheep go right straight to the shepherd the mules will stay out in the pasture the camels will stay out in the pasture the the goats will stay out in the pasture but the sheep all come straight to the shepherd when night comes praise the lord just a wizzle you know i know i live in that country you know just a whistle you know he might have hundreds and hundreds of flock you know different flocks different sheeps you know but when the night comes all the sheaves which belongs to their you know place they go there in the night time and i think we need to come back to the pavilion praise the lord it's time we need to come back to the pentecost it's time that we need to come back to the old time religion it's time we can't stop natural in natural life doing the things of this world the lust of flesh the pride of life how long you know how long will be trying to be busy in this world you know right we have learned the art of doing nothing right that's true we have learned the art of doing nothing we have become busy for nothing you call anybody hey what are you doing brother i'm busy busy for nothing busy doing nothing it's time to come back to you know pentecost it's time to come back to pavilion it's time to come back where we have left god we have spent all our life born again gone again we must grow spiritually every day amen as you know what makes us from moves us from natural to supernatural natural to spiritual is hunger for the word of god physical hunger no food you will die you know this morning my blood sugar was below 100 you know never has been in my life you know it's been almost fasting is almost more than 250 and and the post lunch is almost about 400. the first time in my life for many years it's below 100 this morning and i just came running i said sister i need something to eat no hunger for the food you know no hunger no food physical language you will die in the same way you are not hungry for the world you will die spiritually and if you want to live spiritually if you want to move on to supernatural if you want to move on spiritually you need to kill your flesh and i think killing your flesh is a bunt offering to god that's why paul says i die daily and that's a good opinion you know in these days we need to die daily my brothers my sisters the revelation of god will make us hungry for god and his word church experience will not help us let us not only stay in the church there is more beyond these church doors it is very easy young people i am telling you it is very easy to live holy in the four walls it's very easy to be holy in the house you know live a holy life in the church you know but it all counts how we execute ourselves how they function when we are all by ourselves amen that's right that counts that's very important in our life how we are when we all are by ourselves church experience will not help us we need revelation we need mountain top experience amen let us not stop you know jesus never stopped at get so many that's right he did not stop it gets a minute he moved on from gethsemane he moved on to calvary from calvary he did not stop he moved on to grave that grave he did not stop amen he went to hell at hell he did not stop the devil tried to stop him in gethsemane he tried to stop him in calvary he tried to stop him in grave he tried to stop him in the in the hell he did not stop there if you say you're bomb again if you are saying you're filled with the holy ghost if you are saying you are spiritual if you are saying that you are a new creature don't stop [Applause] no matter how many storms register in your life move on that's the victory don't be a loser amen when can you be a loser winners always talk about winning right that's true but losers talk about winners my brother is my sister the devil is trying to manipulate our minds today he is talking every mind every young mind today he's taking hold of every mind today that's the battlefield of the mind amen that's right we can't stop sister we can't stop he never stopped that get so many he said if it is thine we'll take away this cup if it is thine will but he didn't stop he said let your will be done i know god is talking to someone here today amen we can't move we can't stop just because the cares of this world are holding us let it loose until then unless you don't let it lose you can't be free you can't move on don't stop at the cross don't get mailed don't get nailed and stay there we need to move on we need to move on to calvary we need to move on to grave experience we need to move on to hell experience last three years i'm telling you this is one of the worst hell experiences in my 50 years of my life when you see the persecution rising in the nation of india the hindu government bibles are being burnt people are hungry suffering lost their jobs begging on the streets children's little children eating from the dust bins the whole ground excavated and dug in and the bodies just thrown and they filled up heap of bodies but i thank god i did not affect with the coronavirus in last three years by the help of the church here and and few other brothers i could i and my brother we could distribute provisions for almost 650 families families i'm talking about help more than 427 children with food and provision they're all believers my heart is for the believers but they are poor there are needs of the bible the bibles are being burned the bibles are being taken away the printing bible printing shops are being closed the government wants to wipe out christianity wipe out all the churches by 2023 he might take you to through hell but he did not stay there he might take you to the grave experience but he did not stay there amen he might allow the enemy to nail you to pierce you to mark at you to spit on you to make fun of you but you don't have to be nailed there and stay there forever he's reason he's no more there only revelation will lead us to resurrection when moving towards resurrection you need to go through grave experience amen you need to move on there is power in the resurrection amen then he was alive he said who do you say i am revelation said you are the messiah amen you are the son of the living god you are christ jesus said flesh and blood did not reveal you but my father in heaven has revealed you amen hallelujah you won't get revelation in the church you will get revelation on the mountaintop experience you need to grow higher your survival should have a revival and only revelation can bring that revival in you and i believe we are the candidate of revival today the prophet said don't search for revival here and there you are the revival you are the revival amen we are looking for revival here and there we are looking for oh whom should i invite whom should i go and come to church no no no you'll be the fire first amen you'll be that revival first when you be that revival everything will come running to you that little spark of fire bro it can lit the whole mountains sometimes you see the californian fires a little spark it can take thousands of mountains hundreds of mountains oh your survival should have a revival amen no revival no survival and only revelation can bring that revival in us and i thank god i am a candidate of revival i am a revival hallelujah moses did not stop right in egypt 40 years in the back side of the desert 40 years but it was time god had mercy upon moses he wanted to do greater things in his life and i want to tell you my brothers my sister when god wants to use you when god wants to see that you are a vessel of honor that he can use you he will bring you through that desert he will make your failure he will make you a zero what did moses say i am a bitter failure but thank god he showed him that light he showed him that supernatural moses could have been happy just looking from the lower part of that desert he could have just seen oh it's good sometimes we do that oh the message was good the sermon was good the court was good the lifeline was good this tape was good no no no let us not talk the message he said leave the message he said come out of this mess age not the word is it come out of this mess age the world we are in it's totally messed up the church needs to wake up to the spiritual atmosphere are you there it is i be not afraid he says the little boat as it dashed on across the lake it must have been about that time that satan must have raised up and said oh i have caught them alone without him now my time to settle the score with them for they had been casting out my demons and so forth i will settle the score with them that's when satan can settle the score when he finds that you have gone off without jesus that's when satan will get the church when you get interested in so much in something else besides prayer meetings when you get so interested that you are supposed to have a natural growth instead of a spiritual growth then remember satan's on the road he has caught you without jesus he says my prayer wake up the church again to the old old-fashioned all-night prayer meetings wake the people up to spiritual atmosphere it takes that to bring children into the kingdom it takes an atmosphere we are living in a faceless generation that's what paul said follow me as i follow christ you know it takes the atmosphere the prophet said and in the in the message the supernatural he says that's the reason at pentecost they had to go to an upper room and pray until holy ghost came because it's the attitude of the people that brings the result it's the attitude what attitude you come to the house of worship amen he says that's the reason i had pentecost they had to go to an upper room and pray until the holy ghost came because they got in one place and one icon it's the atmosphere what brings the result you believe that you know and it's the atmosphere that brings the miraculous and wonders and powers of god among the people it's the atmosphere of the people and when people get to a place oh they're reasoning and wondering and stewing and thinking and all tore up and don't know where they do stand half of them not even scripturally thought how can you expect the atmosphere to be right in you can't do it it won't be right it got to be one accord one place and settle down with one more tear that something is fixing to happen and that's the hardest thing today is to people get in that atmosphere atmosphere of worship and the atmosphere of believing my brother is my sister truth is where god is amen do you believe that truth is where god is revelation is where god is revelation is where god is and god is going holy spirit will bring us the revelation of the truth and the revelation is the truth revealed that's why he said you shall know the truth and the truth shall make you free what is the secret of your strength today when you walk in revelation amen walk by faith not by wallet sometimes we walk more than our wallet you know but we need to walk by faith we need to walk in revelation and no bank balance no money no problem right we need to walk in faith we must be kingdom minded amen when you are spiritual you will be kingdom minded peter heartache boat is empty nets are empty need to face his wife don't know what she will say what did you do whole night peter you know why didn't you catch even a fish but thank god there was somebody to provide amen jesus was there jesus jesus was born in natural but he was born from above amen jesus was spiritual he was natural he was 100 percent man hundred percent god you know he was natural he was spiritual heaven was inside him amen when he was there on that boat with peter heaven was on earth why was heaven on earth because jesus was there and if jesus christ is in you today heaven is in you amen you don't need to search for heaven you don't need to look for heaven heaven will come down to you when heaven comes down in your midst there's no lacking brother mark there's no wrestling it's just rest what did what did jesus tell peter cast down your net peter oh he said oh he gave so many excuses i did this i did that a whole night i've been sweating you see my sweat you see my stink he just said do what i tell you and that's what we need sister do what he tells us to do and when we have that revelation i'm telling you whatever it tells us to do we will do it if we don't have the revelation we will start reasoning and that is where the problem today why the big question why is bothering us all he said calm down your nets peter i am the creator of the fish peter you are the creation too amen creation is longing for the creation of man fish is born again peter is gone again hallelujah you know just one word he cashed the net all the fish are gone come you know in the net our hearts desire that he should manifest when he manifests that means his word has manifested in our life how many of you desire to go into the net of jesus not in the www world wide web that's dangerous internet is nothing but entering into the net of the enemy how many hours we spend have you ever calculated per day per week what is your screen time just go and look into that you don't even know you have passed many hours many hours don't even know don't even realize don't even understand but what is the enemy doing he is taking you into that net one day a believer came to the pastor one week he said pastor there's a web you know the spider web in my home it's all spreading what should i do he said go clean it he went and he cleaned that sunday you know and by the next sunday again it formed you know almost two three times he said what shall i do about my web you know what shall i do i'm cleaning it but it's not going on the fifth sunday the pastor god said man he said damn it go kill the spider not the web not not cleaning the web go kill that bug and i want to tell you we need to kill that every bug which is destroying our spiritual life it is serious we don't even know how calmly those bugs are coming in and destroying our lives if you would have killed that spider on the first week you wouldn't have so many ups and downs we need to target the right one we need to target the enemy we need to kill that enemy our desire should go that we need to be in the net of jesus christ not in the world wide web of sin not of the enemy and the devil i don't want to be in his class satan will take you to the brim of the hell and he will push you down he will not come with you he will throw you and he will come back to your own you must move on from natural to supernatural revelation is much needed we need to obey the revelation because revelation has power when we obey amen amen what we need to obey it's the word of god revelation has to manifest and if my preaching has no manifestation it's dead if this word has no manifestation no power it's dead when jesus is in us when his presence is heaven is touching earth amen how is heaven touching her it's because of you religion will only talk sing about heaven amen do you believe that we are the agents of heaven amen i am agent of heaven i'm a candidate of revival i'm telling you wherever i go revival comes wherever i go fire comes wherever i go healings takes place why i am a candidate of revival i move on i fall i'm not i'm not perfect i fall sister i fall i fail but i god has taught me in my life how to rise up if you can't rise up by yourself take help of your brother amen call them brother i need help sister i need help son i need help amen mother i need help pastor i need help and i want to tell you if you can't walk alone take jesus with you he said walk unconscious of this world walk unconscious of this criticism walk unconscious if you're dying what unconscious walk with christ if the world is leaving you walk alone we're colon in christ if everybody is leaving you don't fear criticism right we are agents of heaven that's why we pray that prayer let your kingdom come let thine will be done sometimes you try to be a bonsai plant you know have you ever heard about a bonsai plant the bonsai plant never grows no fruit looks green we can't be like that there was a there was a tree jesus he was hungry it was green it was good but no fruit and the bible says buy your fruits what kind of fruit we are giving brother today what kind of fruit we are bearing today what our children are learning from us today brother when my when my dad gave up his breath away i cried out i said ichabod the glory is gone he has been life too as a missionary he has given life to thousands of families brother after jesus christ if i have seen any humble man that was my father what are we learning from our parents what are our children learning from us today i want to tell you if you are a revival they will become a revival if you move on to spiritual to supernatural they will move on they will look to you but if you stay there natural they will stay there all their life i want to tell you you will have no time even to regret there will be such a time that you can't even regret you will be in pain but you can't do anything about it i'm a candidate of revival i don't want to be on the cross i don't want to be in get some money i don't want to be in the grave right i don't want to be the hell right i want to resurrect i want to move on if i can't move on i want somebody to give me a hand who can push me be a helping hand brother mark sister be a helping hand you can't do good to anybody's physically do something spiritually for them pray for them no one is perfect in noah's ark no one was perfect you know there were animal children in the noah's ark brothers were talking about the noah's ark in kentucky which i would go someday you know but in the bible it talks about noah's heart had a giraffe what's the what's the lifestyle of giraffe the giraffe always looks down upon others all it does is looks down it's true that's the lifestyle and there are many people in the church they always look down others sometimes we act like a giraffe there was a porcupine in the in the noah's ark what does the porcupine do the more you hug the more it hurts i love you brother instead of that warmth of love you feel is pricking you by his words words more powerful than the there thorns people there they act like jira always look upon somebody you know oh he is not good he is not good what about you are you good my bible says no one is good sometimes we act like tortoise touch him it will go in you know have you ever tried to touch the tortoise it will take the head inside oh i have made my own boundary my own wall you won't come in i won't come to your home i won't come to your church you won't come to we have made boundaries we have made camps we don't want to mix with others we don't want to go into the other churches and tell them about this truth but the same prophet have you ever seen the ostrich it's always in the water forever depressed you know the snake what's that quality what's the lifestyle poison the snake has poison only in that teeth but you know where the poison is in us from head to toe the snake that serpent in genesis become a dragon in revelation that's why cardinal minds carnal believers are food for demons this obedience is the food for the enemy and i want to tell the children james are you listening you're playing with your watch disobedience is the food for the enemy and delayed disobedience is delayed disobedience ah delayed obedience is disobedient i did it dan no you didn't do it on time i did it mom i finished it what you said no you didn't finish it all the time you think it is obedience but it is not obedient it is disobedient it's a delayed disobedience my brothers my sisters we need to move on we must be witnesses acts 5 32 he says we are his witnesses of this thing and so is also the holy ghost whom god has given to them that obey him amen how many of you believe that the book of acts is still living again he's still you see the scripture you see the chapter wise all the books have got pull stuff but the book of acts does not have a full staff it's the act of the apostles it's the book of power it's the book of revelation it's the book of signs and wonders all the 65 books of the bible what it has got everything the book of acts has god because it's still going on it's still moving on in science and wonders dr luke says we believe it but we don't believe the bible the way we must believe luke wrote the book of acts that it is a legal language witness means we have seen it our testimony should have a report obedience is the key to open heaven disobedience is the food for devil obey the holy spirit and it will come into your life as i said you before falling is not important when you are in the fallen state get up when you get up obey jesus christ when you get up obey the lord when you get up over his word and a spiritual man obeys the wise of god and also the signs thank god for the sign of this end time and for the voice of this end time music is not a worship but a part of worship singing is not a worship but a part of worship giving is not a worship but a part of worship obeying the voice of god obedience to the word is the highest form of worship amen in this last days god is restoring the structure amen structure means the word of god word revival in the end time spoken word becomes the written word and the written word will become a living word and that has happened in this century the bible says the bible specifies ark of the covenant it was just a box for natural it was foolishness for spiritual for spiritually minded it was life eternal said and i if i be lifted up from the earth will draw all men unto me god is bringing that structure means the word of god you know david was bringing the ark means david was bringing the structure of the word of god david brought the ark on the bullock car actually the priest must carry it but they were bringing it on the bullet car structurally david was wrong it was to be carried by priests we all know what happened the ark of the covenant was left out the house of obedience i'd like to just give a statement when chosen ones become frozen ones when chosen ones becomes frozen ones god will fix the god will pick the forsaken ones forsaken ones are now overcomers what happened obed adam was a forsaken nobody cared for him but see god took him and now he's an overcomer now he's victorious one quality we need now is hungry for the word of god obedient was the first second one the first second one now become a chosen one when our comes to you that means when the word of god comes to you you not only become blessed but you are also becoming blessing to others not only you are blessed you become more generous the forsaken was honored by god oh when david saw the blessing the victory what obeyed adam god david planned to bring that ark in the right manner see we need to carry the word of god in our heart in our life in the right manner with the right attitude with the right motive if you don't do that you know the philistines thought sister that that ark of the covenant oh because wherever they were taking they were getting victory the philistine thought oh even we will get the victory they took the ark of the covenant i want to tell you you know what happened it destroyed them that's why the bible says christ for some is arising and for some he's the falling how do you take how you take the word of god with you with what attitude with what motive david now this time he took it in the right way who should carry the ark of the covenant the priest what was he doing he was dancing in the spirit not 34 not 64. brother mark it was 104. and when you are spiritual my brothers and sisters you won't listen to any criticism david did not pay attention to mikhail ark represented the presence of the king of kings i am that great i am was there david no longer he was a king but he became humble worshiped god with humble praises and i want to tell you when you come into the house of god don't look to the left or the right you need to worship god in spirit amen amen if you're standing like a statue that means you're dead you are alive but you are still dead paul said it is no longer i but christ in me he said i am dead i die daily but christ is living in me moses on the mountain on the mountain of god he said i s he surrendered in front of that burning bush my brother is my sister the prophet of god said you are a star your duty is to reflect the brilliancy of christ stars is giving the reflection of the sun moon is giving the reflection of the sun jesus is the light the son of god the son of righteousness what is the structure today it's the word of god nothing else fasting prayer whole night prayer you know potluck dinners all well get together all well but more important is fellowship with god's word for the word of god together important for building and foundation praise the lord buildings are important foundations are good but we need more of the word of god to build us spiritually amen god is raising a structure he's raising a generation of people who will not compromise don't compromise when it comes to glorify god don't compromise when it comes to worship god when you do it do it for the glory of god and the glory of god will manifest because of the structure what is the structure the word of god the foundation is the word of god which brings forth revelation god doesn't need people he needs obedience the obedient remnant noah everything he built was according to the plan of god build an ark of go forward build it according to god's structure god said noah you build it and i will feel it he's telling to the ministers and the ministries today build it according to god's structure plan you build it god will fill it noah did not invite anybody into the ark no no advertisement on facebook instagram snapchat telegram whatsapp twitter they all came he said no why you build it i will fill it and the lord is telling to every minister and the ministers today you build it and he said i will feel it what we need is neology no theology and that is what many ministers lack today is neology any weaker christian who who is on his knees the devil is afraid the devil shakes we can be on whatsapp for 8 hours a day 10 hours a day but we can't be on our knees for even 8 minutes i'm not against it but the amount of time it is taking i want to tell you there will be a time even though when you grow up when you are in age you will get that disease even if you don't have the phone your hands will still shake you because the amount of messages and the text messages you have all your life you got so used to it that your nerves are so much acquainted so much accustomed to it that even if you don't have the phone you see you see we talk about parkinson's disease but you see you know what the parking is do you don't even know that you are shaking and i tell you you give time to god then you see christ is the head we are the body he has commanded blessings to the one who will follow his word no almighty dollar right i don't believe in almighty dollar i'm telling you my dad always used to say son i came to christ not by seeing at the white skin not seeing america he said i came to jesus christ because he saved me by his blood on the cross of calvary no almighty dollar but almighty god amen communion with him brings wealth health blessings communion every day means remembering him every day jesus is the superstar there's no star there's no superstar here we are only star but he is a superstar hallelujah later glory will be greater than the former glory the bible says come back to the structure what is that the word of god no conviction only convenience it will be thy church remove the tea and it will die daily diet coke diet pepsi you think it is good for your health no no it's it will kill you remove that tea out of diet and you will die so no conviction it will become a diet a formal church remove that tea you will die i will we must embrace the structure that is the word of god what is the structure one hour of prayer one hour of worship you know how many times a baby a little baby cries for milk every day do you know mothers do you know generally speaking seven times every day a baby will if she's really hungry she will cry for milk seven times we must crave for the milks of god's word like little babies that's why jewish people they pray for seven times the muhammadans they pray for five times how many times we pray every day i was coming in the flight it's a ramzan time you know ramadan you know i was seeing you know high officials top rich bureaucrats they did not care who was looking at them in the whole hour 21 hour of my journey i saw people those mummadans they were bending in on their knees touching their head onto the floor have you ever gone on our knees do you know how elijah prayed when that hand you know he saw that you know that mighty hand you know you know how he prayed do you know he went on his knees he put his nest you know head almost down to the floor oh we get up in the morning we catch hold of hands of our wife and husband is a lord we thank you for this day thank you for giving us good night rest we commit this day into thine hands and let it be for thine glory bless me bless my children bless my wife bless my pastor amen god bless you how can we move into supernatural how can we move into spiritual from natural no craving means something is wrong with the baby no craving no crying means something is wrong in the blood in the mind of the baby but there was a time in the life of the apostles in the in the book of acts 2 43 47 he says the fear came upon every soul and many wonders and signs were done by the apostles and all that believed were together and had all things common and sold their possessions and good and parted them to all men as every man had need and they're continuing daily one according the temple breaking bread from house to house did eat their meat with their gladness and singleness of heart praising god and having favor with all the people and the lord added to the church daily that's what we need today the sign of the end time it's a uniting time we need more fellowship praising god and having favor with all people and the lord added to the church daily and should be saved we must not stop amen we must move on into supernatural we must move on to spiritual we are the agents of heaven on earth rise and shine for the light has come such a good name we have for our church here send the light how can you send the light how can you touch somebody with that light the people who are dying in darkness how can you save this life from this place when you have the father of lies amen we have this word this structure this is the most important structure that we need today if we need to move on into another realm we can't live in these four dimensions don't think of in the fifth dimension that's hell but we need to move forward our goal is that seventh dimension we need to move on to spiritual supernatural now only i only plead to you today don't stop move on move on and do what the lord has told you to do obey him obey his word be hungry for the word of god god bless you all thank you for your patience remember us in your prayers the ministry and the needs and the orphans the lepers and the elderly people and the hiv women and children and also the elderly people there are a lot of needs but the lord knows all the needs so god bless you i want to thank brother john for trusting me and giving me his place this is his place i know it's god's but he's the shepherd here and he has trusted me he said it would be nice when i am gone if you can come in and you know and i i felt it an honor and thank you all for for obeying the voice of god the word of god god bless you all thank you that was a such a beautiful service just to really hear the lord moving he's calling us to don't stop where you're at you keep moving forward there's souls that you and i need to reach out to there's heaven that we can bring these people to we can god has given each one of you the authority to bring peace and situation joy life like brother bo say he's given us the ministry of reconciliation go and reconcile somebody go be that revival bring that revival even brother branham said two three people who are on fire for the lord do more than a than 40 of arrivals could ever do like he said that rival starts inside of you you don't don't wait for brother murray to break their bible you be that revival and i just love that if we could sing we've got the power of course we've got the power in the name of jesus we've got
