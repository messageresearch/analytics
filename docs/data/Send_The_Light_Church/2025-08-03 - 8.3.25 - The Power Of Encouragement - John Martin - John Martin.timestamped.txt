[1:36] the power for all things,
[1:43] right?
[1:46] &gt;&gt; We in ourselves don't have the the power
[1:49] to do it. We just have the ability to
[1:51] believe
[1:53] &gt;&gt; and God has the the power to do it.
[1:56] &gt;&gt; Amen. It's good to be with you this
[1:59] morning. I want to say thank you from
[2:02] the family for praying uh for Cheryl's
[2:06] dad, Harry. Um they were able to take
[2:10] out a part of his colon and they feel
[2:13] they got all of it and it looked like a
[2:16] very good success in the the surgery.
[2:19] they won't have the the results of the
[2:21] test for a few more days, but I want to
[2:24] say thank you
[2:26] &gt;&gt; for praying and your continued prayers.
[2:28] We had a chance to pray with him and
[2:30] he's testifying, you know, that God was
[2:33] with him. So, we are grateful for that
[2:37] and want to also congratulate brother
[2:39] and sister Bman.
[2:41] &gt;&gt; Amen. It's beautiful, beautiful
[2:43] testimony.
[2:45] Bill, before we look to the word, let's
[2:48] just bow our hearts in a word of prayer.
[2:52] Dear heavenly father,
[2:54] thank you that you have placed a desire
[2:57] in each of our hearts today to be in
[2:59] your house.
[3:01] Lord, there are others who you have
[3:04] called
[3:06] that could be here this morning
[3:09] but have chosen not to be.
[3:12] So Lord, we count it a privilege that
[3:14] the desire you placed inside of us is so
[3:17] strong that we couldn't wait till the
[3:19] doors were open today.
[3:22] &gt;&gt; Lord, thank you for that. Thank you for
[3:24] the Holy Spirit that resides inside of
[3:27] us.
[3:29] And this morning, Lord, we're we're
[3:31] looking to you, Lord.
[3:34] Father, we are incapable in ourselves to
[3:39] to really
[3:41] do anything that would help feed your
[3:45] bride.
[3:46] But the great Holy Spirit is the only
[3:49] one that can feed us. And we pray that
[3:52] you would come in a way this this day uh
[3:57] Lord in a personal way to every one of
[3:59] our hearts that we could recognize that
[4:02] it is you speaking Lord
[4:05] and that we uh would would find it easy
[4:09] to accept your word into our hearts this
[4:14] morning that we could leave here uh more
[4:17] equipped to face the enemy when we
[4:20] leave. Bless each and everyone. Lord,
[4:23] you see the needs that would be
[4:26] represented in our lives. The perhaps
[4:28] questions and on hearts, directions that
[4:31] would be needed, healings for the
[4:33] bodies, those that are hungering uh for
[4:36] more of the Holy Ghost, those that are
[4:40] desperate for deliverance, those that
[4:42] are wanting just to get ready for the
[4:46] hour that we know not when you would
[4:47] return. God, may you come in a
[4:50] supernatural way today and may all of
[4:52] our hearts be able to look to the unseen
[4:55] God in our midst. Oh Lord, that you
[4:59] might have your way.
[5:01] Thank you, Lord, for this grace as we
[5:04] commit the service in your hands. Pray
[5:06] that you bless the reading of the word
[5:09] and the preaching of the word and the
[5:11] hearing thereof. God, we give you praise
[5:14] and honor for these things. We pray in
[5:16] Jesus precious name. Amen.
[5:19] &gt;&gt; Amen. Turn with me if you would to the
[5:21] book of 1st Samuel chapter 30 for our
[5:25] opening scripture.
[5:27] 1st Samuel chapter 30.
[5:33] And in this uh set of scriptures, David
[5:37] is just getting back. He was actually
[5:41] uh was going to be in a place that he
[5:43] would be fighting against Israel. And
[5:45] God uh didn't wouldn't allow that to
[5:49] happen. And here he comes back to the
[5:53] city
[5:54] where his family was in the family of
[5:58] all the soldiers. And starting here in
[6:00] verse number one of 1st Samuel chapter
[6:03] 30. And it came to pass when David and
[6:06] his men were come to Ziglaggle on the
[6:09] third day that the Amlikites had invaded
[6:12] the south and Zigleg and smitten Zigleg
[6:16] and burned it with fire and had taken
[6:20] the women captives
[6:23] that there that were therein.
[6:28] Uh they slew not any, either great or
[6:31] small, but carried them away and went on
[6:34] their way. So David and his men came to
[6:37] the city, and behold, it was burned with
[6:40] fire, and their wives and their sons and
[6:43] their daughters were taken captive.
[6:46] Then David and the people that were with
[6:48] him lifted up their voice and wept until
[6:52] they had no more power to weep.
[6:57] Just imagine if that had happened to
[7:00] you.
[7:01] And David's two wives were taken
[7:03] captives. Ahonium the Jezeritis
[7:08] and Abigail the wife of Nabbo the
[7:11] Carmelite.
[7:13] And David was greatly distressed for the
[7:17] people spoke of stoning him
[7:21] because the soul of all the people was
[7:23] grieved. every man for his sons and his
[7:26] daughters.
[7:28] But David encouraged himself in the Lord
[7:31] his God. Amen. God bless you. You may be
[7:34] seated.
[7:39] You know, David was a man that wasn't
[7:42] always he was pretty he was solid. I
[7:46] could say that. There was a time that
[7:48] they they said uh Saul had killed his
[7:51] thousand, but David his 10,000.
[7:55] &gt;&gt; But that didn't lift up David. That
[7:56] didn't make him feel like a big head.
[7:58] And he was just steady. And we can see
[8:02] here that at his highest highs or as low
[8:05] as low, he didn't let things get to him.
[8:09] And here he's at a spot that there was
[8:11] his wives are gone, his family's gone,
[8:12] the the city is burnt. His own men are
[8:15] are are wanting to stone him, get rid of
[8:17] him, get get another leader in here. And
[8:20] but he stood solid. The solid rock he
[8:24] stood and he encouraged himself in the
[8:26] Lord.
[8:28] This morning we want to entitle this
[8:30] message the power of encouragement
[8:33] and and take uh for a a subject
[8:36] encouraging ourselves in the Lord.
[8:39] &gt;&gt; Has anybody ever been discouraged
[8:41] before?
[8:43] &gt;&gt; Well, this message is for you then.
[8:46] &gt;&gt; This message is for you.
[8:49] Discouragement,
[8:51] the dictionary says, is a loss of
[8:53] confidence
[8:55] or enthusiasm.
[8:59] It can also be the feeling of being less
[9:02] confident or less hopeful.
[9:05] The Bible says that we're not ignorant
[9:07] of the devil's devices, but often times
[9:09] people become ignorant of
[9:11] discouragement.
[9:13] What I mean by this is that
[9:15] discouragement seems to be a large part
[9:18] of people's lives,
[9:21] but they ignore how dangerous it is to
[9:25] be in a state of discouragement.
[9:29] Discouragement is the devil's workshop
[9:31] in which he can craft up anything to
[9:33] happen once you get discouraged.
[9:36] Discouragement distracts and hinders
[9:38] individuals and leads them away from
[9:40] positive actions and a a spiritual
[9:42] growth that happen. So as soon as he
[9:44] gets you in that place of
[9:46] discouragement,
[9:47] you you you've you're disfused. There's
[9:50] no armor. There's no strength. There's
[9:52] no power because you've been
[9:54] discouraged. Amen.
[9:57] &gt;&gt; In other words, the devil's motive for
[9:59] wanting to get us discouraged is to try
[10:01] to get us away from that place of I'm
[10:03] going to press in
[10:04] &gt;&gt; to like I'm just going to like hang out
[10:06] here and see if somebody will encourage
[10:08] me.
[10:09] &gt;&gt; People who are discouraged are are more
[10:12] susceptible to negative influences.
[10:14] &gt;&gt; Things like gossip and not caring and
[10:16] bad attitudes. Not necessary to go to
[10:19] church or or to pray through or to
[10:22] listen to a message. A a message
[10:26] all negative influences because of
[10:28] discouragement.
[10:30] People who are discouraged are less
[10:31] likely to pursue good and and productive
[10:34] endeavors.
[10:36] They take their foot off the gas. They
[10:38] stop building spiritually.
[10:41] But in all honesty, discouragement is
[10:43] all around us. And life is full of
[10:46] disappointments.
[10:48] Things trying to swallow up our
[10:50] expectations.
[10:54] There's always another issue to deal
[10:56] with. I haven't even got to put a stone
[10:58] on the greenhouse this year because of
[11:00] everything else that came up. And my
[11:02] plan was to to get it done this year.
[11:04] Well, it's not even going to happen. I
[11:05] haven't even started.
[11:07] Another issue to deal with,
[11:10] another unexpected problem, another a
[11:13] bad attitude to deal with, another bill
[11:15] in the mail, more sickness, uh more
[11:19] rebellion to deal with, another restless
[11:22] night.
[11:24] &gt;&gt; And when it comes down to it, often
[11:26] times we feel like no one seems to care
[11:28] when we're discouraged.
[11:32] &gt;&gt; Coming to church doesn't necessarily
[11:34] bring encouragement.
[11:37] Coming to church doesn't necessarily
[11:40] bring encouragement.
[11:43] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham says we either leave
[11:45] church closer to God or further away.
[11:49] &gt;&gt; And leaving church further away isn't
[11:51] encouraging.
[11:53] &gt;&gt; See, it's our attitude about the word
[11:55] that makes the difference.
[11:57] When we positively look to the word of
[12:00] God
[12:03] for our lives personally, then it will
[12:07] encourage us.
[12:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[12:10] &gt;&gt; Great peace have they that love thy law,
[12:14] and nothing shall offend them.
[12:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[12:18] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandon says, "If you come to
[12:20] church to find fault, there's plenty
[12:21] enough to see."
[12:23] &gt;&gt; There's plenty enough to see.
[12:25] &gt;&gt; Amen. Unquestionably, everyone welcomes
[12:28] encouragement
[12:30] into their lives. Everyone wants to be
[12:32] encouraged.
[12:34] And often times, we expect others to
[12:37] encourage us,
[12:39] &gt;&gt; especially when we're down. It's just
[12:41] that, you know, that entitlement, you
[12:43] know, you're doing better than me. It's
[12:45] your job to encourage me.
[12:48] &gt;&gt; But in reality,
[12:50] we hold the power of encouragement right
[12:52] inside of us. Amen.
[12:55] &gt;&gt; And I want to say a statement. I hope it
[12:57] sticks with you forever.
[12:59] &gt;&gt; Never place your power into the hands of
[13:01] another person to encourage you.
[13:05] &gt;&gt; Never do that.
[13:08] &gt;&gt; You'll sorely be disappointed.
[13:12] &gt;&gt; God will allow you to be placed in
[13:14] positions that will force you not to
[13:19] rely on other people's encouragement.
[13:21] Amen.
[13:23] &gt;&gt; Just so you learn to lean and trust in
[13:25] the Lord
[13:26] &gt;&gt; so he can teach you to grow up.
[13:29] &gt;&gt; Just to teach us to encourage ourselves
[13:31] in the Lord.
[13:33] God wants us to learn to encourage
[13:36] ourselves in the Lord
[13:38] &gt;&gt; to cast to really be able to to cast our
[13:42] cares upon him for he cares for us
[13:45] &gt;&gt; to to to come to grips that it's not the
[13:49] situation
[13:51] that needs to be right. But he is our
[13:53] peace.
[13:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[13:54] &gt;&gt; He is our hope. He is a present help in
[13:57] a time of need. He wants us to rely on
[14:00] his promises. And and so we got to
[14:02] remember his promises and rely on them.
[14:05] &gt;&gt; So God wants us, this is an important
[14:09] important an important word here. God
[14:12] wants us to safeguard against
[14:14] discouragement.
[14:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[14:16] &gt;&gt; Because once you get discouraged, you
[14:19] you you you don't have any power to
[14:22] overcome the devil.
[14:23] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[14:25] So I would say if we would stand if we
[14:28] would recognize when discouragement is
[14:30] trying to come against us and safeguard
[14:32] against that then we won't we won't uh
[14:35] be left without any armor without any uh
[14:39] any strength to do the right thing
[14:42] &gt;&gt; because once discouragement happens we
[14:44] just kind of throw our hands up and we
[14:46] don't feel to care. It's almost as
[14:49] important to to safeguard. We'll see in
[14:52] the scriptures here coming up to
[14:54] safeguard against discouragement.
[14:57] &gt;&gt; And I'll say the important to remember
[15:00] this. If we don't safeguard against and
[15:03] we get discouraged,
[15:05] God is not going to pick us up every
[15:07] time we get in the dumps.
[15:10] &gt;&gt; Every time we get discouraged, God is
[15:12] not going to come and pick us up. Yeah.
[15:15] I'm going to say it again. Don't expect
[15:17] God to come every time we get in the
[15:18] dumps and get lazy and get discouraged
[15:21] to pick us up. He's not going to. That
[15:22] is not the nature of God.
[15:25] &gt;&gt; God wants us to grow up into all things.
[15:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[15:29] &gt;&gt; Unto a perfect man, the measure of the
[15:31] statue of Christ, that we be henceforth
[15:33] no more children tossed to and fro. God
[15:36] wants us to grow up.
[15:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[15:39] &gt;&gt; So, we must learn to safeguard ourselves
[15:42] from discouragement.
[15:43] &gt;&gt; Amen. and learn to encourage our own
[15:47] selves in the Lord.
[15:50] &gt;&gt; It's not everybody else's job to keep us
[15:52] pumped up,
[15:54] &gt;&gt; encouraged or enthused.
[15:56] It's not the song leader's job to make
[15:58] you feel like you you should worship.
[16:01] &gt;&gt; I'm sorry. It's not.
[16:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[16:04] &gt;&gt; That is your relationship with God
[16:05] before you come through those doors.
[16:07] &gt;&gt; That's your attitude. Come on.
[16:10] &gt;&gt; If you got a if you got a you you're
[16:12] expecting something better to be
[16:14] happening up here to help you. I'm
[16:16] telling you, it's all emotion and it's
[16:18] not the reality of God in your life.
[16:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[16:22] &gt;&gt; God has placed the power inside of us.
[16:25] &gt;&gt; We must learn to encourage oursel and
[16:27] I'll say it like this. In the midst of
[16:29] an of adversity,
[16:32] &gt;&gt; in the midst of advers just like just
[16:34] like David,
[16:36] the children of Israel could not keep uh
[16:39] could not keep themselves encouraged
[16:42] along their journey to the promised
[16:44] land.
[16:46] They they murmured,
[16:47] &gt;&gt; they complained, they fussed, they
[16:50] stewed, they whined, they taught behind
[16:52] Moses's back. The Bible says that God
[16:55] was grieved with them.
[16:57] &gt;&gt; He also said they did not know me.
[17:02] &gt;&gt; They Can you imagine walking 40 years in
[17:05] the message of the hour and not knowing
[17:07] God?
[17:10] &gt;&gt; They seen the miracles. Their shoes
[17:13] didn't wear out. They had a great blue
[17:16] cross plan,
[17:18] &gt;&gt; but they did not know God. That was his
[17:20] testimony of them.
[17:24] They never became partakers of the
[17:26] promise of Christ because why? They
[17:29] didn't hold the beginning of their
[17:31] confidence steadfast to the end.
[17:34] &gt;&gt; Wow.
[17:36] &gt;&gt; The expectation that God has of a
[17:38] Christian who says, "I'm going to get
[17:40] baptized. I'm going to start serving
[17:41] God."
[17:42] &gt;&gt; He expects them to be on fire all the
[17:44] way through.
[17:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[17:45] &gt;&gt; To keep going.
[17:48] They came up to the promised land and
[17:49] God told Moses to send gall men to spy
[17:52] out the land. And Joshua and Caleb were
[17:55] were two of the 12 spies. And all 12
[17:58] spies, did you know they agreed with
[18:01] part of the message?
[18:03] They did. They had all agreed in part of
[18:06] the message. But it was the easy part of
[18:08] the message.
[18:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[18:11] &gt;&gt; Surely the promise of God flowth with
[18:13] milk and honey, and this is the fruit of
[18:15] it. We brought forth the fruit. It is
[18:17] just like, you know, everybody just love
[18:20] the the healings and the discernment and
[18:23] um uh God that that there's against
[18:27] denominations,
[18:29] the easy part.
[18:33] But 10 of the 12 spies recanted
[18:36] part of the message
[18:39] and they gave an evil report. The Bible
[18:42] says they recanted.
[18:45] What was that evil report? Anybody know?
[18:53] If I could say it like this to bring it
[18:55] home to us, it was not continuing to
[18:58] grow in all things
[19:00] that Christ had given them.
[19:03] &gt;&gt; Because when they were in Egypt, God
[19:04] gave them the promised land.
[19:08] And they went right up to it and said,
[19:12] "I don't have confidence to go get the
[19:15] Holy Ghost."
[19:17] &gt;&gt; I don't have confidence to come into the
[19:19] image of Christ. I don't have confidence
[19:22] to be just like him. In other words, my
[19:25] life, I'm going to say over here, I'm
[19:27] predestinated, but my life is not going
[19:29] to be working towards what I'm
[19:30] predestinated to.
[19:35] That was the evil report.
[19:40] &gt;&gt; They chose to stop moving forward. They
[19:43] they refused to stop pressing in.
[19:48] And it is it's evil to stop moving
[19:50] forward into the character of Christ.
[19:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[19:52] &gt;&gt; It's evil to stop adding uh virtues to
[19:56] your life. Amen.
[19:58] &gt;&gt; Hebrews 3:12 says, "Take heed, brethren,
[20:02] lest there be in any of you an evil
[20:04] heart of unbelief in departing from the
[20:06] living God."
[20:08] &gt;&gt; Now, notice this is he's referring to
[20:11] the children of Israel. They their
[20:13] attitude was, "Well, I'm not leaving
[20:15] God. I'm just going to serve them
[20:17] outside of the Holy Ghost.
[20:20] I'm going to serve them outside of the
[20:22] promised land." And a lot of times
[20:24] Christians are very content serving God
[20:27] without the Holy Ghost.
[20:29] &gt;&gt; Very content.
[20:32] &gt;&gt; That is just the devil.
[20:35] &gt;&gt; We need to go on and get the Holy Ghost
[20:38] &gt;&gt; because if we're don't, it's evil and
[20:40] we're under the influence of a wrong
[20:42] spirit.
[20:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[20:46] Now this departing
[20:48] is the departing from overcoming all
[20:50] things.
[20:53] This departing from the living God is
[20:55] departing from overcoming all things. In
[20:57] other words, I can overcome some things.
[20:59] That should be good enough.
[21:01] No, God wants you to overcome all
[21:03] things. The promise is to him that
[21:04] overcometh all things.
[21:05] &gt;&gt; He's the one that's going to sit with me
[21:07] on the throne as I've sat with my father
[21:09] on the throne.
[21:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[21:12] It's departing from losing the interest
[21:16] from pressing into the image of Christ
[21:18] from laying aside all things until we
[21:21] can love with perfect love as the
[21:22] prophet said.
[21:24] God caused us an evil heart of unbelief.
[21:27] Well, like how many times have we
[21:30] focused on having perfect love in the
[21:32] last week?
[21:34] Have we?
[21:36] It should be something that should be
[21:39] first going on in our lives
[21:42] &gt;&gt; because it's
[21:44] brother Brandham said that's
[21:47] that's that's all that was there. You
[21:50] couldn't even enter in without it. He
[21:53] comes back with his report from spying
[21:55] over the land and he says, "Whatever you
[21:57] do, lay aside, well, lay aside whatever
[22:00] you got going on and whatever your ideas
[22:02] and whatever your plans are, whatever
[22:04] you want to do this year and wherever
[22:06] you want to go, lay it aside until you
[22:08] get perfect. Let that be your goal, your
[22:11] motive,
[22:12] &gt;&gt; because you may not live to do what you
[22:14] want to do,
[22:18] &gt;&gt; but exhort one another daily." Verse 13.
[22:22] While it is called day,
[22:25] exhort one another.
[22:27] Stay with it. Come on, let's go. We got
[22:29] to become more like Christ.
[22:31] &gt;&gt; Exhort one another daily. While it is
[22:32] called today, lest any of you be
[22:36] hardened through the deceitfulness of
[22:38] sin. You ever get a hard heart?
[22:42] That's because of your unbelief.
[22:45] &gt;&gt; That's where it comes.
[22:47] For we are made partakers of Christ, not
[22:51] if we repent and get baptized,
[22:54] if we hold the beginning of our
[22:56] confidence steadfast to the end, not
[22:59] just after the beginning.
[23:03] &gt;&gt; So what is God's vision for you? That's
[23:06] important to know that. Yeah.
[23:09] &gt;&gt; If it's just to come to church and kind
[23:11] of satisfy your church attendance, not
[23:13] going to make it.
[23:19] Joshua and Caleb were the only two
[23:21] preachers who believed the message right
[23:23] to the end.
[23:25] &gt;&gt; They believed the whole message. The
[23:28] rest of them only believed a portion of
[23:30] the message. And this is why it's
[23:31] important to not get caught up in
[23:33] saying, "Well, I believe in the
[23:34] message." and you kind of cherrypick
[23:36] what you like
[23:39] &gt;&gt; because the whole heart of the message
[23:41] is that Christ is going to be manifested
[23:42] in your life. If the message doesn't
[23:44] bring that to you, you missed the
[23:46] message.
[23:47] &gt;&gt; You missed it.
[23:52] &gt;&gt; In the midst of church adversity,
[23:56] those two encouraged themselves in the
[23:59] Lord.
[24:00] &gt;&gt; 1.8 million murmurss and complaints. Can
[24:02] you imagine going to church with them?
[24:04] Can you imagine living with a murmur and
[24:05] complainer?
[24:07] Going to church with them, having to sit
[24:10] there and who's turn to preach? And
[24:14] they weren't uh they weren't preaching
[24:17] the whole word.
[24:19] &gt;&gt; You know, Brother Brham says if you
[24:21] can't uh if you can't find a whole loaf,
[24:24] you should at least be eating a a piece,
[24:26] right? A slice of bread. Amen.
[24:30] &gt;&gt; Can you imagine for 40 years everybody
[24:32] you talk to negative?
[24:35] This was in church.
[24:37] &gt;&gt; This is church adversity.
[24:41] &gt;&gt; But they were special, these two men.
[24:46] In the midst of church adversity, they
[24:48] encouraged themselves in the Lord. They
[24:52] were enthusiastic. Their attitude was,
[24:55] "Well, the bigger the giants are, the
[24:57] harder they're going to fall."
[24:59] &gt;&gt; They were not dismayed. They were full
[25:01] of confidence. They were full of faith.
[25:02] They were full of trust.
[25:05] &gt;&gt; They didn't allow the people they were
[25:08] rubbing shoulders with to influence what
[25:10] was in the inside of them. Amen.
[25:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[25:15] &gt;&gt; Numbers 13:3 says, "And Caleb stilled
[25:19] the people before Moses and said, "Let
[25:22] us go up at once and possess it, for we
[25:24] are well able to overcome." And I'm
[25:27] telling you, when things just start to
[25:29] get hairy, wherever you're at in your
[25:31] homes or whatever is going on, the best
[25:33] thing to do is still the people, still
[25:36] the still the children, still the
[25:38] husband, still the wife, still the
[25:40] church, still the atmosphere. Quiet it
[25:43] down.
[25:46] &gt;&gt; Don't let the devil just go rampid.
[25:50] &gt;&gt; Get things still and then give the
[25:52] message. Let us go. Let's serve God with
[25:55] all of our heart.
[25:56] &gt;&gt; Let's put God first, not second, not
[26:00] starting tomorrow. Now, today is the
[26:03] day.
[26:06] &gt;&gt; They kept themselves encouraged. They
[26:09] kept a right mental attitude. They
[26:11] didn't allow fear
[26:13] to get them down. They safeguarded
[26:16] themselves from a wrong attitude. Do you
[26:19] know it's easy to get a wrong attitude
[26:22] when things don't go your way?
[26:25] I mean, it's easy to wake up on the
[26:27] wrong side of the bed.
[26:30] &gt;&gt; Numbers chapter 14 verse 22.
[26:34] Because all those men which seen my
[26:36] glory and my miracles which I did in
[26:40] Egypt and in the wilderness and have
[26:42] tempted me now these 10 times and have
[26:44] not hearkened to my voice. Can you
[26:47] imagine? Surely
[26:49] they shall not see the land which I
[26:51] swear to unto their fathers, neither
[26:53] shall any of them that provoke me see
[26:55] it. Now you got to understand this is
[26:57] really referring to not seeing the power
[27:01] of the Holy Ghost in your life.
[27:05] &gt;&gt; That's what this is referring to.
[27:08] Because if if we we're going to murmur
[27:10] and complain about all of our trials,
[27:11] all of our tests, we're not getting what
[27:13] we want, we're not willing to take the
[27:15] word,
[27:17] God just says, "Okay,
[27:19] you're not going to see the promised
[27:21] land." Because the promised land is the
[27:23] Holy Ghost living inside you
[27:26] &gt;&gt; to the point to the point that it's not
[27:30] you anymore, but it's him,
[27:32] &gt;&gt; right?
[27:34] And you've got love, you've got joy,
[27:36] you've got peace. You do not live for
[27:38] yourselves anymore because you've been
[27:40] set free of yourself. You're living for
[27:42] others. You're not selfish. You're
[27:44] selfless.
[27:53] &gt;&gt; Verse 24.
[27:59] But my servant Caleb,
[28:02] because he had
[28:04] another spirit with him,
[28:08] what was that spirit? That spirit is
[28:11] described right here.
[28:14] And have fully follow followed me fully
[28:19] and have followed me completely.
[28:23] &gt;&gt; See, most Christians will follow God to
[28:25] a point. Amen.
[28:27] &gt;&gt; Oh, I'll do it to hear, but that's it.
[28:31] &gt;&gt; But the spirit of God
[28:33] says yes to every word of God.
[28:36] &gt;&gt; It will live by every word of God.
[28:40] &gt;&gt; It'll it'll overcome by the word of God.
[28:43] &gt;&gt; We don't leave out one part because
[28:45] we're leaving our our part out of the
[28:46] book of life. We we need the whole word
[28:48] of God.
[28:51] And we need to start not just if I could
[28:54] say it like this, we can agree with
[28:57] that, but is our life living that? Are
[29:01] we are we taking the gra in the word
[29:03] into our lives and say, I'm going to go
[29:05] to church. I'm going to hear the word of
[29:06] God and Lord, my heart is to start
[29:08] living it.
[29:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[29:10] &gt;&gt; To start implementing it. Because if you
[29:12] don't practice this habit, how in the
[29:14] world are you fully going to follow the
[29:16] Lord?
[29:18] &gt;&gt; So, it's not agreeing with it. You
[29:20] you've got to possess it. Joshua and
[29:23] Caleb had another spirit.
[29:27] They have fully followed me. Him will I
[29:31] bring into the land wherein he went and
[29:34] his seed shall possess it. God said he'd
[29:37] give the Holy Ghost to them that obey
[29:38] him.
[29:39] &gt;&gt; Fully follow him. So right now we're
[29:42] we're like on a here we it it isn't how
[29:45] long you've been coming to church gives
[29:47] you the Holy Ghost.
[29:49] These men followed the pillar of fire
[29:52] for 40 years, day and night, followed
[29:55] the Lord, could testify their God was
[29:58] the only God their shoes didn't wear
[29:59] out.
[30:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[30:01] &gt;&gt; That the only God that could heal, they
[30:04] could testify to all the other nations,
[30:05] all the other denominations.
[30:16] But that's not good enough.
[30:21] Because at the end, if we don't come
[30:23] into the image of Christ, we're not
[30:25] going in a rapture.
[30:31] &gt;&gt; You could sit and you could pound and
[30:32] you could you could fight yourself,
[30:36] fight anybody to death saying that this
[30:38] message is true, but if this message
[30:40] isn't living inside you, you're not
[30:42] going in a rapture.
[30:44] &gt;&gt; The word has to be manifested. Amen.
[30:52] &gt;&gt; Joshua and Caleb had another spirit. It
[30:55] was a right spirit. I'll say it like
[30:57] this. Make sure you got a right spirit
[31:00] &gt;&gt; inside of you. That spirit that they had
[31:03] was God's spirit. It was a spirit of
[31:05] confidence,
[31:07] a spirit of trust and power. For God has
[31:09] not given us the spirit of fear, but of
[31:11] power and love and of a sound mind.
[31:13] Their spirit didn't lean to their own
[31:16] understanding, but they acknowledged the
[31:18] Lord in the situation and they and God
[31:21] directed them, "Move forward. We're more
[31:23] than able to take the land."
[31:26] &gt;&gt; They didn't look at the giants.
[31:29] They looked at God's word that said, "It
[31:32] is yours and they just followed fully."
[31:36] &gt;&gt; Look, you their own understanding
[31:39] couldn't understand it.
[31:43] Well, you know, why should I go on the
[31:45] altar and get serious with God?
[31:46] Nothing's going to change.
[31:50] Lean to your own understanding. It'll
[31:52] take you further away from God.
[31:55] &gt;&gt; God deals with our hearts.
[31:57] &gt;&gt; He's trying to change our desires.
[32:03] &gt;&gt; Verse 25. Now the Amalites and
[32:04] Canaanites dwelt in the valley. Tomorrow
[32:08] uh turn you and get into the wilderness
[32:10] by the Red Sea. And the Lord spake unto
[32:12] Moses and Aaron, saying, "How long shall
[32:14] I bear with this evil congregation?"
[32:18] This was his people that he caught out
[32:20] of Egypt. And now he calls them an evil
[32:22] congregation.
[32:26] Which murmur against me.
[32:29] I have heard the murmurings of the
[32:31] children of Israel. Remember, first he
[32:34] heard the cry of his people in Egypt and
[32:37] he came down to deliver them. He
[32:39] delivers them. And now he's hearing the
[32:41] murmuring
[32:43] &gt;&gt; murmurings which they murmur against me.
[32:46] Say unto them, "As truly as I live,
[32:48] sayeth the Lord, as ye have spoken in my
[32:51] ears, so I will do to you." Oh my my.
[32:54] I'll say this. God hears when you murmur
[32:56] and complain.
[32:58] &gt;&gt; You may not do it in church. You may do
[33:00] it on the phone. You may do it in the
[33:01] text. You may do it somewhere else. But
[33:03] God hears it. And I'll say it like this.
[33:05] It's coming back to you.
[33:08] It's right here. You're going to see it
[33:10] right here.
[33:13] He says, "So I will do to you. Your
[33:16] carcasses shall fell in the wilderness,
[33:18] and all that were numbered of you
[33:20] according to the whole number from 20
[33:22] years old and upwards, which have
[33:24] murmured against me." Doubtless. Just
[33:28] think about this. Don't you think all
[33:30] those parents, all those people above 20
[33:32] years old, don't you think that they
[33:35] influence the children?
[33:39] &gt;&gt; They influence the children.
[33:45] &gt;&gt; God hated that.
[33:47] God hates when we influence the children
[33:50] with negativity.
[33:56] your carcasses
[33:58] um okay from 20 years old upward and
[34:01] that which have murmured against me.
[34:02] Doubtless ye shall not come into the
[34:05] land cons concerning which I swear to
[34:08] make you dwell there save Caleb the son
[34:11] of Junapath and Joshua the son of Nun
[34:15] but your little ones
[34:17] this is powerful right here which you
[34:20] said should be a prey them what I bring
[34:24] in bring in and they shall know the land
[34:28] which ye have despised.
[34:31] Think about the times that you told your
[34:33] children that it wasn't that necessary
[34:36] to do what was asked for them to do in
[34:38] church
[34:39] &gt;&gt; or what the prophet said to do or it
[34:42] wasn't that necessary to go to church or
[34:44] wasn't that necessary to go to Sunday
[34:46] school or wasn't that necessary to be
[34:48] respectful or wasn't that necess
[35:00] it it. We're not up here making our own
[35:02] rules.
[35:04] &gt;&gt; We've been taught. We've been taught by
[35:07] the seventh days messenger. I'll stay
[35:09] with that more than I'll stay with any
[35:10] other man.
[35:12] &gt;&gt; We just got to have a heart. We got to
[35:14] have a revelation of what's happening in
[35:16] this hour.
[35:20] &gt;&gt; Joshua and Caleb knew how to encourage
[35:24] themselves in the Lord in the midst of
[35:26] adversity because nobody was there
[35:28] patting them on the back.
[35:30] They stood alone.
[35:34] The Bible tells us in Peter that whom
[35:37] speaking of the devil whom we resist
[35:39] steadfast in the faith knowing that the
[35:42] same afflictions are accomplished in
[35:44] your brethren that are in the world. We
[35:47] all are facing adversity.
[35:50] All of us are. We have to learn to take
[35:53] charge and keep ourselves encouraged.
[35:57] Amen.
[35:59] Well, you know what?
[36:03] I want you uh we we if we don't face
[36:07] discouragement with the right spirit,
[36:09] then we constantly have to be babyed by
[36:11] other people to stay encouraged. And I'm
[36:13] sorry, this message is not for you. This
[36:16] this message is for the overcomer.
[36:18] That's what this message is for.
[36:20] &gt;&gt; Joshua chapter 1 verse one.
[36:24] Now after the death of Moses,
[36:28] now this is about 39 40 years later
[36:31] after what we just read.
[36:34] Now after the death of Moses, the
[36:36] servant of the Lord, it came to pass
[36:37] that the Lord spake unto Joshua the son
[36:39] of Nun, Moses's minister, saying, Moses,
[36:43] my servant, is dead. Now therefore
[36:45] arise, go over this Jordan, thou and all
[36:47] this people unto the land which I do
[36:51] give them, even to the children of
[36:53] Israel, and every place that the soul of
[36:54] your feet shall tread upon. Uh that I've
[36:56] given you as I said to Moses and from
[36:58] the describes the the the geological
[37:02] territory there. Uh but you know, we got
[37:04] uh love, joy, peace, longsuffering,
[37:06] gentleness. That's our territory.
[37:09] There shall not be any man that shall be
[37:11] able
[37:13] to stand before thee all the days of
[37:15] your life. As I was with Moses, so I
[37:18] will be with thee, and I will not fail
[37:21] thee, nor forsake thee. Now, that sounds
[37:24] pretty cut and dry.
[37:26] &gt;&gt; I I'll take that right there.
[37:30] &gt;&gt; But there's something more that's
[37:31] needed.
[37:35] Be strong and be of good courage.
[37:39] For unto this people shalt thou divide
[37:41] for an inheritance in the land which I
[37:43] swear unto their fathers to give them.
[37:46] Now this is 3940 years later. Joshua and
[37:49] Caleb had another spirit and their
[37:51] spirit is were more than able to take
[37:53] the land. And now God is coming and it
[37:56] almost sounds like he's commanding be
[38:00] courageous. be.
[38:04] &gt;&gt; It's a commandment.
[38:07] Be. You need to be this way. You can't
[38:10] rely just on doesn't matter what your
[38:13] attitude is. I'm still taking you over.
[38:16] &gt;&gt; No. Because you got adversity coming.
[38:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[38:19] &gt;&gt; The devil don't want you to get the Holy
[38:21] Ghost. The devil wants you just to
[38:23] relax. You can't wait till church is
[38:25] out. Get get what you got going on the
[38:27] rest of the day. You know, get caught up
[38:29] on things.
[38:32] Boy, I feel like preaching right now.
[38:36] &gt;&gt; God is actually commanding us to be
[38:39] strong and to be courageous.
[38:41] &gt;&gt; Not some laxidasical encouragement, but
[38:43] a commandment.
[38:45] &gt;&gt; We look at that. He was God was just
[38:46] trying to laxidasical encouraging. And
[38:49] that is not what was happening.
[38:54] If not, Joshua could have got weak in
[38:56] his mind
[38:58] and begin to faint. There was a reason
[39:01] that God said, "Be strong. Be
[39:03] courageous." And I'll say this, it is
[39:05] our job to stay encouraged in the Lord.
[39:08] Do not expect the preacher to do it.
[39:11] Don't expect your friend to do it.
[39:15] &gt;&gt; You know, we get real carnal. I'm going
[39:16] to call so and so. I'll tell you what
[39:19] you need to do is call on God. Amen.
[39:21] &gt;&gt; Call on God.
[39:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[39:23] &gt;&gt; Wait on the Lord. He'll renew your
[39:25] strength.
[39:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[39:28] &gt;&gt; Verse seven says the very same thing in
[39:30] verse six. Only be thou strong and very
[39:35] courageous.
[39:39] To do what?
[39:42] That thou mayest observe to do according
[39:44] to all the law which Moses my servant
[39:47] commanded thee. turn not from it from
[39:49] the right hand or to the left that thou
[39:51] mayest prosper whethersoever thou goest.
[39:54] Wow. If I just focus on obeying the
[39:59] word,
[40:00] &gt;&gt; not my goals,
[40:03] not how I want things to do, but I'm
[40:05] going to straighten the preacher. I'm
[40:07] going to straighten the church out.
[40:09] &gt;&gt; I'm going to let them know. No, just
[40:12] stay with the word.
[40:13] &gt;&gt; Stay with the word. You want your life
[40:15] to prosper, stay with the word. Amen.
[40:18] &gt;&gt; This book of the law shall not depart
[40:20] out of thy mouth, but thou shalt
[40:23] meditate therein day and night, that
[40:26] thou mayest observe to do according to
[40:29] all that is written therein.
[40:32] &gt;&gt; For then and only then thou shalt make
[40:35] thy way prosperous, and then thou shalt
[40:38] have good success.
[40:41] &gt;&gt; And he comes back for the third time.
[40:44] Have not I commanded thee? Have not I
[40:47] commanded thee? Be strong and be of good
[40:50] courage. Be not afraid, neither be thou
[40:53] dismayed, for the Lord thy God is with
[40:55] thee, whethersoever thou goest. Now, God
[40:57] has given us one thing to do, and that
[40:59] is to believe the word from cover to
[41:01] cover. Get serious about this message.
[41:03] Get the message in your home.
[41:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[41:05] &gt;&gt; Yes. Get it in your home. Get it in your
[41:07] heart. Get it in your lives. Dig into
[41:10] it. Don't expect the five-fold ministry
[41:12] up here to do it for you. You've got one
[41:14] that you should be listening to all the
[41:15] time.
[41:17] &gt;&gt; The message of the hour.
[41:22] That's how you become strong and of good
[41:24] courage.
[41:27] We don't come to church just to be
[41:29] encouraged only.
[41:31] No sir. No madam. No Christian friend.
[41:36] We don't come to church just to be
[41:38] encouraged only.
[41:41] We must encourage ourselves to follow
[41:43] the word that comes from the church
[41:47] &gt;&gt; to observe all to do accordingly that is
[41:50] written.
[41:52] I know it's it may not be exactly what
[41:55] you want to hear, but it'll definitely
[41:56] get you down the road.
[41:58] &gt;&gt; It'll definitely take you through hard
[42:00] times. It'll definitely meet you when
[42:02] the going gets tough and you ain't got
[42:04] nobody to turn to. But God will be
[42:06] there. He'll meet you. He'll meet you.
[42:09] He said, "I'll never leave you. I'll
[42:11] never forsake you. I'll be with you
[42:13] whethersoever thou goest."
[42:15] &gt;&gt; We don't need brother John. All we need
[42:18] is God.
[42:20] &gt;&gt; God before us. Who can be against us?
[42:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[42:26] &gt;&gt; We want to make our way prosperous and
[42:27] have good success. We must learn to
[42:30] encourage oursel
[42:32] &gt;&gt; to meditate on God's word day and night.
[42:35] Though none go with me, still I'll
[42:36] follow. Learn to encourage yourself.
[42:40] Turn with me to John uh Jonah chapter 2.
[42:44] Now,
[42:46] I just need you to pray that you get
[42:49] this real quick. You say a lot of amens
[42:51] and that you don't look at me like, uh
[42:54] um what's going on? And that we get
[42:56] through this because
[42:58] I want to get to the good part.
[43:02] &gt;&gt; Jonah encouraged himself in the Lord
[43:04] right in the midst of adversity.
[43:07] Jonah chapter 2:1 Then Jonah prayed unto
[43:09] the Lord his God out of the fish's
[43:11] belly. And he said, 'I cried by the
[43:14] reason of my affliction unto the Lord,
[43:16] and he heard me. Out of the belly of
[43:18] hell cried I, and he heardest my voice.
[43:24] For thou has cast me into the deep, in
[43:25] the midst of the sea, and the floods
[43:26] compass me about to all thy billows and
[43:29] thy waves pass over me. Then said, I I
[43:32] am cast out of thy sight. Yet I will
[43:35] look again toward thy holy temple. I
[43:38] don't think anybody
[43:40] has ever been in this predicament.
[43:45] This would have been doomsday.
[43:49] This would have been I'm a goner.
[43:52] I mean, I messed up. I
[43:56] I rebelled against God for the last
[43:59] time.
[44:01] I'm in a pickle.
[44:04] And I can imagine the devil was beating
[44:06] him up. Do you know, brother Ron, there
[44:08] was nobody there to encourage him.
[44:12] &gt;&gt; There wasn't one person there to
[44:13] encourage him. You know what he had to
[44:15] do? He had to remember the word of God
[44:18] that he read before.
[44:20] &gt;&gt; He had to remember. And that word is
[44:23] what encouraged him.
[44:26] &gt;&gt; Praise God.
[44:28] The waters compass me about even to my
[44:30] soul. The depths clothed me about. The
[44:32] weeds were wrapped around my head. I
[44:33] went down to the bottoms of the
[44:35] mountains. The earth was her. Bars was
[44:38] about me forever. Yet has thou brought
[44:40] me up my life from corruption. Oh Lord
[44:43] my God, when my soul fainted within me,
[44:45] I remembered the Lord and my prayer came
[44:47] in unto thee into thy holy temple.
[44:51] So you're praying from here,
[44:54] but your prayers is reaching God. Amen.
[45:01] &gt;&gt; They that observe lying vanities forsake
[45:04] their own mercy.
[45:06] We can either stare at our problem and
[45:07] be discouraged or we can encourage
[45:09] oursel in the Lord in the midst of
[45:11] adversity. Say, "I'm not going to look
[45:13] at that. I'm going to believe in the
[45:14] promises of God.
[45:17] &gt;&gt; But I will sacrifice unto thee with the
[45:19] voice of thanksgiving. and I will pay
[45:21] that which I have vowed. Salvation is
[45:23] the Lord. I wonder sometimes when we
[45:24] come to church why it is so hard for us
[45:26] to praise the Lord.
[45:29] &gt;&gt; We owe that vow to God.
[45:32] &gt;&gt; We should not be asked, hey, let's
[45:34] praise the Lord.
[45:35] &gt;&gt; There should be something inside of a
[45:37] believer who's full of thanksgiving. I
[45:39] will pay my vow in the house of the
[45:41] Lord.
[45:42] &gt;&gt; I will give praise to my God.
[45:45] &gt;&gt; Look for all that he's done for me.
[45:47] I'll tell you when he did that at that
[45:49] time when that praise went forth and the
[45:53] Lord spake unto the fish and it vomited
[45:55] out Jonah unto dry land.
[46:00] &gt;&gt; Praise is the way to get God on the
[46:02] scene. He inhabits the praises of his
[46:04] people.
[46:05] &gt;&gt; Now sometimes we cry because of our our
[46:08] affliction as well, right? The things
[46:10] that we go through.
[46:12] But we hold the power of encouragement
[46:14] right inside of us. And we need to
[46:16] remember whenever we're in a trial, we
[46:19] need to encourage ourselves in the Lord.
[46:22] That means trust in him.
[46:24] &gt;&gt; Trust in God that he'll he'll be there
[46:26] to see you through because it's through
[46:28] that encouragement that you begin to
[46:30] build your faith in the situation.
[46:32] Without faith, it's impossible to please
[46:34] him.
[46:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[46:35] &gt;&gt; So, you've got to put in action this
[46:37] this confidence, this trust that God is
[46:40] going to see me through. He's not
[46:41] forsaken me. He's with me. There there's
[46:44] a there's a purpose in this. I I I I I I
[46:46] just going to trust God in this
[46:48] situation.
[46:50] &gt;&gt; Don't look at your lion vanities.
[46:54] Now, even though David was a born
[46:56] leader, he was anointed king, he was a
[46:59] man that God chose after his own heart.
[47:02] &gt;&gt; David still had to encourage himself in
[47:04] the Lord.
[47:06] &gt;&gt; I'll say it like this. Nobody else was
[47:08] going to do it for him.
[47:10] In fact, they weren't just off doing
[47:13] what they wanted, Brother Ron. They
[47:15] wanted to stone him.
[47:17] &gt;&gt; They wanted to stone him. Let's get rid
[47:19] of our leader.
[47:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[47:22] &gt;&gt; How easy it would have been just to
[47:25] quit.
[47:27] Sometimes we're not getting what we want
[47:29] from somebody and we just want to quit.
[47:32] Come on. Who wants to who wants to enjoy
[47:34] the message with me today? Because I I
[47:38] can't imagine being in David's
[47:40] situation.
[47:42] I'd much rather be in the situations
[47:43] that I'm in. You know what I'm saying?
[47:46] But we need to learn not to murmur and
[47:48] complain about our situation. We need to
[47:50] encourage ourselves saying, "God is with
[47:52] me."
[47:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[47:54] &gt;&gt; God is with me.
[47:56] &gt;&gt; The city in which they live was
[47:57] completely burned with fire and all the
[47:59] women including his wives were taken
[48:01] captive. But D, the Bible says that
[48:04] David was greatly distressed.
[48:07] For the people spake of stoning him,
[48:08] because the soul of all the people was
[48:11] grieved, every man for his sons and his
[48:13] daughters, but David encouraged himself
[48:16] in the Lord his God.
[48:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[48:19] &gt;&gt; He couldn't speak for the murmurss and
[48:21] complaining, but he knew his God.
[48:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[48:27] One time he said, "When my heart is
[48:29] overwhelmed, lead me to the rock that's
[48:31] higher than I."
[48:34] &gt;&gt; Psalm 3:6, "I will not be afraid of
[48:36] 10,000 people that have set themselves
[48:40] against roundabout."
[48:43] So, who cares who's against you? If God
[48:46] before you, who can be against you?
[48:51] Psalms 5:7, "But as for me, I will come
[48:54] into thy house in the multitude of thy
[48:56] mercy, and in thy fear will I worship
[49:00] toward the holy temple."
[49:02] Psalms 18:2, "The Lord is my rock, my
[49:06] fortress, my deliverer, my God, my
[49:08] strength, and whom I will trust, my
[49:10] buckler, and the horn of my salvation,
[49:13] and my high tower. I will call upon the
[49:16] Lord, who is worthy to be praised. So
[49:19] shall I be saved from my enemy. David
[49:23] learned to encourage himself in the
[49:26] Lord. And we hold the that same power of
[49:29] encouragement, every one of us, inside
[49:31] of us.
[49:33] If the Bible says I can do all things
[49:34] through Christ who strengthen me, then I
[49:37] can do all things through Christ who
[49:38] strengthen me. Yes.
[49:40] &gt;&gt; If the Bible says, "Greater is he that's
[49:42] in me than he that's in the world, then
[49:45] I believe greater is God inside of me
[49:47] than he that's in the world."
[49:49] &gt;&gt; We, like Job, hold the power to stay
[49:52] encouraged in the midst of adversity.
[49:54] Job's family was slain. They were all
[49:57] destroyed. His friends secretly judged
[50:00] him. His wife turned against him. God
[50:02] refused to comfort him. In all this, Job
[50:06] sinned not, nor charged God foolishly.
[50:10] Job humbled himself, fell down on the
[50:12] ground, and the Bible says he worshiped
[50:14] God.
[50:16] You know, we just want to go and tell
[50:17] everybody our hard trial that we're
[50:19] going through that shouldn't have
[50:20] happened. And I got to tell you what my
[50:21] friend did, my mom did, my daughter, my
[50:24] husband, my wife, my
[50:28] &gt;&gt; Why do you got to tell that?
[50:30] &gt;&gt; You got to tell that because you're not
[50:31] in the spirit.
[50:33] You got to tell that because you're not
[50:35] trusting in God. I'm telling you, God is
[50:38] calling a bride to wake up, to grow up,
[50:40] to stay up, and get ready for a rapture.
[50:43] &gt;&gt; That's what God's doing.
[50:45] &gt;&gt; He's getting us prepared.
[50:48] &gt;&gt; Though he slay me,
[50:51] Job said, "I'm still going to trust
[50:53] him."
[50:55] &gt;&gt; I wonder if there's somebody here today
[50:57] that says, "I don't care what God does
[50:59] in my life. I'm still going to trust
[51:00] him.
[51:04] &gt;&gt; I'm going to hold you to this.
[51:06] I don't want you murmuring and
[51:08] complaining anymore.
[51:09] &gt;&gt; It's got to stop.
[51:14] &gt;&gt; For he said, "I will never leave you. I
[51:16] will never forsake you that we may
[51:18] boldly say, the Lord is my helper. I
[51:20] will not fear what man shall do unto
[51:23] me."
[51:27] Bible says, "For though we are killed
[51:30] all day long,
[51:32] we are counted sheep as the slaughter,
[51:34] yet in all these things we're more than
[51:36] conquerors through him that loved us."
[51:39] Think about our the father of our faith,
[51:42] Abraham.
[51:44] We can we hold the very same faith that
[51:46] our father Abraham holds. Are we are we
[51:49] not? We're children of Abraham.
[51:51] &gt;&gt; The Bible says, "Who against hope, he
[51:53] believed in hope." Amen.
[51:55] &gt;&gt; Being not weak in faith, he considered
[51:57] not his own body being dead when he was
[51:59] about a hundred years old, neither yet
[52:01] the deadness of Sarah's womb. He
[52:03] staggered not at the promises of God
[52:05] through unbelief, but was strong in
[52:08] faith, giving glory to God, and being
[52:10] fully persuaded that what he had
[52:13] promised, he was able also to perform.
[52:18] I don't want to be the mediocre
[52:21] Christian who just comes to church and
[52:23] isn't interested in being changed.
[52:27] &gt;&gt; I'm interested in becoming in the image
[52:29] of Jesus Christ.
[52:30] &gt;&gt; I want to become so much more like him
[52:32] than I am now. I got a ways to go,
[52:34] brother Ryan, but I'm pressing in by the
[52:36] grace of God. I'm gonna get there. I
[52:38] believe it.
[52:41] Paul who lived in adversity and
[52:43] afflictions and persecutions.
[52:46] He encouraged himself and we can be just
[52:49] like Paul. Paul was beaten, whipped,
[52:51] stoned, suffered, prisoned, shipwreck,
[52:53] perils of all sorts.
[52:56] If Paul was going to receive glory for
[52:58] any of his devotions and and things that
[53:01] he did, it was going to be through his
[53:03] sufferings
[53:04] &gt;&gt; because that's all he had. He lived a
[53:07] life of suffering. Amen.
[53:08] &gt;&gt; 2 Corinthians 11:30 says, "If I must
[53:12] glory, I will glory of the things which
[53:14] concern my infirmities."
[53:17] In the midst of his adversity, as a
[53:19] physical affliction, he learned to
[53:21] encourage himself in the Lord. There was
[53:23] nobody there to encourage him. No one
[53:25] else.
[53:29] 2 Corinthians 12:9.
[53:32] And he said unto me, God said unto him,
[53:35] "My grace is sufficient for you.
[53:40] For my strength is made perfect in
[53:41] weakness. Most gladly, therefore, will I
[53:44] rather glory in all my problems,
[53:48] in my infirmities."
[53:51] Why? Why would you say something like
[53:52] that? Because that's the opportunity
[53:55] that the power of Christ may rest upon
[53:57] me. Amen.
[54:00] &gt;&gt; If everything's going good, people ain't
[54:02] going to see Christ in you.
[54:04] &gt;&gt; They're just going to see you're happy.
[54:06] You're happy.
[54:09] Well, you go to Cedar Point, you see a
[54:10] lot of happy kids.
[54:14] You you you if you're there at you're at
[54:17] the date uh the date the gate walking
[54:20] into uh some casino, you're going to see
[54:22] a lot of parents big smiles. It's when
[54:25] they're leaving that you see the frowns,
[54:27] right?
[54:28] &gt;&gt; It's not about being happy.
[54:31] &gt;&gt; It's about Christ being inside of you
[54:33] and living his life through us.
[54:35] &gt;&gt; Therefore, I take pleasure in my
[54:38] infirmities, in reproaches, in
[54:40] necessities and persecutions, in
[54:42] distresses for Christ's sake. For when
[54:44] I'm weak, then am I strong.
[54:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[54:48] &gt;&gt; I can do all things through Christ who
[54:51] strengthenth me. Paul commanded us to be
[54:54] strong in the grace that is in Christ
[54:56] Jesus to endure hardness as a good
[54:59] soldier of Jesus Christ. He says,"I
[55:02] suffer truffle as an evildoer even unto
[55:05] my bound bonds. Therefore, I endure all
[55:09] things for the elect's sake that the
[55:12] elect of God may also obtain salvation
[55:15] which is in Christ Jesus with eternal
[55:17] glory." He said, 'Be strong in the Lord,
[55:21] in the power of his might.' We're
[55:23] commanded by the Lord throughout the
[55:25] scriptures. It's a command. It's not a
[55:27] choice. It's not a choice because I'm
[55:29] telling you, as soon as you become weak
[55:31] and you're not strong, the devil is
[55:34] going to get you.
[55:36] &gt;&gt; He and he's going to make you so
[55:38] fruitless spiritually that you don't
[55:40] even care about people.
[55:42] &gt;&gt; Yes, it's the truth. I've seen it. You
[55:44] go through the weekend, it's all about
[55:46] you. There's no nothing on your mind
[55:48] about winning a soul.
[55:50] &gt;&gt; Come on now.
[55:54] &gt;&gt; This gospel isn't for you alone.
[55:56] &gt;&gt; The reason God brought you in was so he
[55:58] could use you to bring the rest of the
[56:00] family in. It didn't stop with you. If
[56:03] it stopped with you, the rapture would
[56:04] have taken place.
[56:12] We like David hold the power to
[56:14] encourage ourselves in the Lord. Though
[56:17] a host should encamp against me, my
[56:20] heart shall not fear. Though war should
[56:23] rise against me, in this I'll be
[56:26] confident. The Lord is my light and my
[56:29] salvation. Whom shall I fear? The Lord
[56:32] is my strength of my life. of whom shall
[56:35] I be afraid? We hold the power to
[56:39] encourage ourselves in the Lord. We hold
[56:42] it. Don't place it in somebody else's
[56:44] hand. Don't place it in the song leader.
[56:47] Don't place it in the preacher.
[56:51] It's you believing the word of God.
[56:56] &gt;&gt; If you can believe the word of God, all
[56:57] things are possible.
[57:01] There was no way that Jonah could have,
[57:05] you know, picked up the phone and dialed
[57:06] 911 or, "Hey,
[57:09] hey, congregation, I'm sorry. Come and
[57:11] grab me, will you?
[57:13] &gt;&gt; I'm in this pickle." No. So often God
[57:16] puts us in situations that forces us to
[57:19] look to him,
[57:21] &gt;&gt; to encourage ourselves in him.
[57:24] God deals with us as individuals. We're
[57:27] here at church. We're a body. We're a
[57:28] local body. We're supposed to function
[57:30] as a body. But I'm telling you, not
[57:32] everyone.
[57:36] God deals with us individuals. Though
[57:38] none go with me, still I'll follow.
[57:41] &gt;&gt; We've got to be willing to get more
[57:42] serious with God
[57:44] &gt;&gt; to walk out of here. I'm going to become
[57:46] more like Jesus. I'm going to get
[57:48] serious with my walk with God.
[57:51] Don't take it at your pace. Take it at
[57:53] God's pace.
[57:57] We hold the power to encourage ourselves
[58:00] in the Lord by thinking on these things
[58:03] by keeping our mind stayed upon him by
[58:06] remembering that nothing can separate us
[58:08] from the love of God which is in Christ
[58:10] Jesus. It doesn't matter the adversity.
[58:12] If God be for us who can be against us
[58:16] he that spared not his own son but
[58:18] delivered him up for us all. How shall
[58:19] God not freely give us all things?
[58:23] He ended by saying,"For I am persuaded
[58:25] that neither death, nor life, nor
[58:27] angels, nor principalities, nor powers,
[58:29] nor things present, nor things to come,
[58:32] nor height, nor depth, nor any other
[58:33] creature shall be able to separate us
[58:35] from the love of God, which is in Christ
[58:37] Jesus our Lord. We don't have to wait to
[58:40] get to heaven to get filled with God's
[58:42] love."
[58:44] &gt;&gt; You can have it right here. Fact, you
[58:46] can have it right now.
[58:48] Amen.
[58:48] &gt;&gt; You want it bad enough, you can have as
[58:51] much God as you you want because God is
[58:53] endless. You can never get too much of
[58:55] him.
[58:57] &gt;&gt; I think the problem is we get too much
[58:59] too much of ourselves. We get too full
[59:00] of ourselves, too satisfied. Right?
[59:06] Isaiah 30:15 says, "For thi, for thus
[59:09] sayeth the Lord God, the Holy One of
[59:11] Israel, in returning and rest shall you
[59:14] be saved, and quietness and confidence
[59:16] shall be your strength." What did he
[59:19] tell the children of Israel at the Red
[59:20] Sea? Be stand still and know the
[59:24] salvation of the Lord and know that I am
[59:26] God. Stand still and know that I am God.
[59:30] God wants us to look to him. That
[59:33] confidence is right here. I don't care
[59:35] if the bottom falls out, the boss fires
[59:38] us, the the the dinner burns, the tires
[59:42] are flat, we got more bills than we got
[59:44] money. Nothing matters. We have what
[59:47] it's inside to take us through.
[59:50] &gt;&gt; We have it. We We don't look to anybody
[59:52] else to, you know, pat us on the back
[59:54] anymore. We're growing up children.
[59:59] &gt;&gt; Now we're sons and daughters of God.
[1:00:01] We're we're mature adopted children.
[1:00:04] We're not tossed to and fro.
[1:00:07] &gt;&gt; Just remember, let's stand together.
[1:00:09] Well, we hold the power.
[1:00:13] We hold the power within us to encourage
[1:00:17] ourselves in the Lord.
[1:00:22] Some of you may have heard the story
[1:00:24] about a a donkey and he was an old
[1:00:28] donkey and he could hardly pull things
[1:00:31] anything more. He couldn't plow the the
[1:00:33] gardens any anymore.
[1:00:36] And this old farmer said, "Well, we'll
[1:00:40] just get rid of them. We'll just get rid
[1:00:42] of them. and next time he's by this big
[1:00:45] well that doesn't work anymore cuz it's
[1:00:47] all dried up. We'll just kind of push
[1:00:49] him in the well.
[1:00:51] And so he got pushed into the well and
[1:00:53] he didn't know what was happening. Lucky
[1:00:55] he didn't break any of his legs but he
[1:00:57] was certainly bruised up and he was
[1:01:00] crying for help. Help me. Help me.
[1:01:04] And no one helped him. His owner just
[1:01:09] said it's just time to go. You've served
[1:01:11] your purpose. I have no more use for
[1:01:14] you.
[1:01:16] And so he didn't have any help, any
[1:01:19] encouragement.
[1:01:22] And then all of a sudden he felt the
[1:01:25] dirt hit his back from the the old
[1:01:28] farmer. He started burying
[1:01:33] this donkey alive.
[1:01:37] And he cried all the more, "Help me.
[1:01:39] Honk honk." Whatever they they do.
[1:01:44] But they went but but no one responded
[1:01:46] and nobody came.
[1:01:50] &gt;&gt; So this donkey, you know what he did?
[1:01:53] He encouraged himself in the Lord.
[1:01:58] &gt;&gt; He took the adversity that was on his
[1:02:00] back. He shook it off.
[1:02:03] &gt;&gt; And then he stood on top of that
[1:02:04] adversity and he walked his way up and
[1:02:07] he walked right out.
[1:02:09] If God be for you,
[1:02:11] &gt;&gt; that's all you need.
[1:02:14] &gt;&gt; You don't need anything else.
[1:02:19] &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's sing. I have decided to
[1:02:22] follow Jesus.
[1:02:28] &gt;&gt; Decided
[1:02:31] to follow Jesus.
[1:02:34] I have decided
[1:02:37] to follow Jesus.

[1:02:43] to follow Jesus.

[1:02:57] me. The cross before me. The world
[1:03:02] behind me.

[1:04:01] Though none go with me, still I will
[1:04:06] follow.
[1:04:07] Though none go with me, still I will
[1:04:11] follow.
[1:04:13] Though none go with me, still I will
[1:04:17] follow.

[1:04:32] person that will ever regret it.
