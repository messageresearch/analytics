rejoice hallelujah and we should be rejoicing all the way to the pearly gates amen hallelujah well i'd like to change border service a little bit amen hallelujah well let's just pray for all those that aren't here first of all and uh that uh whatever the need would be that god would meet it whether it's a bigger burning in their heart whether it's a physical need doesn't really matter you know there's going to be a day that we can't gather together and um so so much more precious are the ones that we can amen hallelujah so let's just pray for them on our hearts amen this morning for whatever the cause amen god knows them all amen my sister hand as a request please pray for sister cheryl today her body is being attacked by the enemy pray that our god would spiritually touch her this very hour amen in agreement with that amen it's you know sometimes it's easy to to fight when you see the end but when you don't see the end you got to be determined and just keep persevering and i'm so thankful that our sister perseveres amen amen let's just pray for uh our sister trisha's needs and their family amen uh for the loss we pray for that and the family and everybody that's

request to to reach out to the and desire to to win a uh win a soul for christ you know there's so many things we can help people and you see it around the world where you know just different ways of of helping a neighbor or helping a friend which we should all do but people a lot of people just well that's that's that's all i can do they never even considered a spiritual they never they did furthest thing from their mind i'll help you i'll go buy you a meal or i'll go do this but when it comes to the soul it's just there's nothing there there's no desire for that soul you know so let's just pray that that would be the first thing in our mind you know uh you know there's old saying you know you know you can take somebody fishing but if you teach them for fish they can eat eat forever right it's the same thing with the lord right you can take him to church but if he can get him saved then they can live forever so and let that be be our desire not only for our children for but for everybody amen and uh be destined in that amen also there's just a uh announced announcement i brought some of our my sister-in-law's clothing that she donated uh it's in the back so if uh there's anybody that's looking for anything you know in the next week or so i'll i'll take that down and give it to goodwill if nobody wants it so there's some tops and some skirts i believe some people have taken some but if you know anybody that needs it so just take it because i'm just going to give it to goodwill after that so um you know i'm sure she took care of her stuff you know knowing knowing her so i'm sure it's in good shape let's just pray for all the loss let's pray for all the um my brother that's back there studying and and so wants to give us the word of god the way he wants to

time he who fed the multitude turn the water into one to the hungry callers now come and dine amen praise the lord amen i hope you're hungry what an honor it is to to sit at the table of the lord and i think this often when i go to sit down at at the table and i see all the work that my wife and ann would put into making meals just a lot of work and just one of the things that ann made yesterday just a lot of times she spent into it and so i gave a third to cheryl a third for me and i left a third for her and she said oh no i i don't like this i made those for you and mom i thought that was so beautiful that she did that for us and time the lord put so much in to wanting to help us but we've got to appreciate the word that he has for us amen and so being hungry is the greatest appreciation that we could have is he promised to fill us if we just hunger amen amen let's look to the lord in a word of prayer our gracious heavenly father we thank you that you have kept these doors open today and we can gather together and worship you praise you to express our love to you in song and chorus and lord to express our love to you in your word by receiving it into our hearts by by rejoicing in it and lord we as mere humans lord just were incapable of providing a food for your bride only you can do that and only you can make it known and we're not able to turn the button to make revelation pour out upon us but oh god we're humbling ourself before you you said you'd give grace to the humble and we're humbling ourself before in asking that you would come down this morning by a way of revelation and reveal the word to us that we would hear give us those ears to hear what the spirit is saying to us lift us up into that heavenly realm lord let us walk out of service today mourn your image mourn your likeness continuing the work of the lord that you have for us until you would call us we thank you for these things ask your blessings on all the word that we would hear today for we give you praise in jesus precious name amen amen turn with me if you were to the book of ephesians i got thinking this morning that every one of us on he in the service today need more of god and how that came to me was that god does not take us until we're most ready so that means there must be more of god for us isn't that encouraging amen amen ephesians chapter 4 starting with verse number 17 this i say therefore and testify in the lord that ye hence for forth walk not as other gentiles walk in the vanity of their mind having the understanding darkened being alien and alienated from the life of god through the ignorance that is in them because of the blindness of their heart who being past feeling have given themselves over until lasciviousness to walk to work all uncleanness with greediness amen but ye have not so learned christ amen god bless you may be seated um in this little series of walking with god last service we entitled the message walking with the mind of god and and today we want to title this message walking without the mind of god well praise the lord brother john [Laughter] that's okay i've been alone before i can do it again um last service we made mention of three minds god's mind satan's mind and man's mind and actually we learned that satan's mind is this mind that we're born with by nature by default it's it's similar in nature just like in revelations chapter 13 verse 18 here is wisdom let him that have understanding count the number of the beast for it is the number of a man right same as the beast number of man and just like the three types of believers there's believers unbelievers and mate believers the scriptures teach us that the mate believers end up at the same place that the unbelievers end up amen just like the unprofitable servant he was a servant he was still a servant but he was unprofitable and for the kingdom he was unprofitable for the kingdom so he doesn't make the rapture all right so it's it's it's important not just to be a servant of god but to be profitable for the kingdom amen and most people think that there are three ways there's god's religious way and speaking of the worldly way of thinking here which that's satan god's religious way is is uh is how it is one way that most people think and it's it's very religious but they don't really realize that satan is also religious so that they're tricked in that way but then there's also satan's way which is horrifying and evil and tormenting and they they they look at it as an extreme but not not knowing again that there is a side of jesus that's very tricky very very religious and then there's their own way of thinking their own mind which they're right in their own eyes uh in other words the the extreme of of of of of god being real religious where you don't need to do that we already know satan is it's real real horrifying we don't do that and in man's mind he's got a balance and everything he sees everything correctly so he's he's right in his own eyes and that's the way the majority of the world functions and that's why it's hard for them to come to church and hear a pure word and say yes that is really the right way amen now one of those has a greater influence on man either satan's way satan's mind or god's mind amen it's going to have a greater influence on man if we do not labor to crucify our flesh our our our first nature die out daily to our way of thinking we'll never walk with the mind of the lord it isn't i'm walking with the mind of the lord ever since i got baptized i mean if you just look just look the past week you'll know you're about to see that there is times in your week that it wasn't the mind of the lord so it requires what jesus taught us to die daily it takes a constant effort to not walk in the vanity of our mind amen i remember living completely in the world at one time in my life i was wearing as i've made mention before pink bell-bottom pants having long hair and i thought i was so cool one time i prepared for weeks to play in our school gong show there's the three of us in the group and there's guitar and a female singer and we were just gonna but we got gunged we talk about vein i remember growing marijuana from seeds planted them right next to my grandma's plants in the living room thinking that nobody would ever know i remember being a businessman selling it remember playing hockey and become an assistant captain remember making these 16 foot long bat boards and i mean they were heavy it took like three people to carry them out onto our pond just wanting to impress everybody that that was around me now you know i didn't go around saying look at me but that desire nobody else on the whole lake built boards like i did i remember saving pounds and pounds of old coins i'm talking about the vanity of my own mind i had endless music collections i built a raft to float around the lake i thought that would be so cool as a kid now that's a cool thing i remember tearing our our neighbor's garage down block by block because i didn't want him to build it it was right across the street and i didn't want it to be there i've done a lot of vain things in life while walking in the vanity of my mind i really wanted to be a doctor i started going to college for it but the lord had other plans in his mind for me until this day when everyone's asleep in our house i will walk downstairs every day and pull out those plastic latex gloves from the box take two of them out of it and i will put those on you know they start to stretch them make sure they go every morning anne's asleep cheryl's asleep i'll put those on to feel the latex around my skin oh yeah having having that glove [Music] between my hand but having that glob between my hand and the germs oh yeah when that's done i'll walk outside and get the ash bucket and clean the ashes out of the furnace out of the fireplace that's what i do with my gloves because those ashes when you go to clean the glass you know they will eat your hand our minds can get corrupted or taken over by simply not holding ourselves accountable to what we think we think if we think it it's okay that's the most dangerous thing to think amen if we get lazy in our minds and don't try the spirit or our thoughts that come to us will end up working vanity in our own minds it doesn't take much not being sober or vigilant or being spiritually relaxed or lazy or in a state of always thinking you're right about things and we end up waking up walking in the vanity of a carnal mind amen we let we read last service about the danger walking in our carnal mind romans chapter 8 verse 7 you simply not walking with god when you're walking in a carnal mindset because the carnal mind is enmity against god for it is not subject to the law of god neither indeed can be so then they that are in the flesh they cannot even please god amen what we're doing is we're slamming the door on god's face when you're in a carnal mindset there's no connection there right amen yeah god is able to just knock you down get you off your high horse anytime he wants to but his nature is not to do that you notice he did that once to paul paul didn't go back out in the world and say well you got if you really love me you got to do it again it comes time that we got to make a decision for our lives and every day we have a decision to let our mind be the mind of christ or to to be carnal it happens much easier to us than we realize look what happened to abraham and sarah satan provided an easier way for them to get what they wanted they used hagar instead and look at the problems it caused look what happened to lot satan provided an easier way for lot he chose the well-watered plains of jordan because it was easier for him it's more enticing for him look what happened to balaam satan provided an easier way to make some money but he ended up corrupting the whole church that's right look how satan corrupted the the mind of naaman from the simplicity of just following god's word come to church hear god's word this is what god wants you to do he said in second kings chapter 5 verse 12 are not abner and far far rivers of damascus better than all the waters of israel may i not wash in them and be clean so he turned and went out of church in a rage because the word that was presented to him he didn't like amen thank god he had a servant that restored him amen walking without the mind of god will always lead us to trouble look what happened to eve satan provided an easier way for her to get what she wanted and satan is scheming up easier ways for you to get what you want that's why if you do as much as you can as hard as you can to say the lord is my shepherd i shall not want and to really exercise that right because if there's no want satan can't get to you amen he gets to you through your want he wants to let you know that you don't have to walk the straight and narrow path the harder way he's always presenting an easier way to be the bride all right that's true that's why you know i'm bright just by you know because i believe you know and it it it's that's an easy way you know you don't gotta do nothing second corinthians chapter 11 verse two second corinthians chapter one verse two for i am jealous over you with a godly jealousy for i've espoused you to one husband that i may present you as a chaste virgin to christ we must come into the image of christ to marry him amen now brother branham did say that in one place what makes the bride a virgin is that she's not in a denomination a man-made system she's separated from that but it's not just being in a church that isn't a denominational church because remember even though this is a church and we have a belief system inside every church there's three types of believers and you yourself are a church amen so you have to become a chaste virgin to separate from your mind your thoughts your ideas and stay fully with the word amen amen but i fear lest by any means as the serpent begot eve in other words satan will try any means to beguile you but i fear lest by any means as the serpent begot eve through his subtility so your minds notice where it happens so your mind should be corrupted from the simplicity that's in christ amen cropped your minds he's out there wanting to corrupt the way that you think satan will use any means to get you away from walking with the mind of god which is simply obeying what the word says just obey what the word says amen why do you why do you think satan gets you so busy that you don't got time to read and sometimes you know we're so busy that we listen to a tape when we're always doing something else well at least i'm listening well that's good that works for a short time right but if you don't have an interest god i want my life to change and i need you to speak to me about what you want me to change i mean because that's it there's two there's two things that we the bride should be doing number one coming into his image amen amen by receiving all the word we need to be helping our brother come into the same image that was a great commission amen that's it that's that but we want the the the thing that entertains us about the message because there's no change but this message god sent a message to get us in his image right this message gets us in his image not knowledge it makes us gives us the character if we follow it the character of christ and the burden for our brother soul that's his message you get outside of that now i i'm not saying that there's not wonderful and beautiful things that god doesn't give us outside of it because he does right he does he does but remember he said the healing was just the bait god didn't god really is not interested in healing our bodies he's interested in healing our souls i'm not saying god don't care about our bodies he does but look for us to care about the natural things and put spiritual things on such a back burner is not where god is at god doesn't want to see us suffer naturally go through hardships he doesn't but in the aspect if they produce his will like it please the father to bruise jesus if it produces the long-term goal which is to get his his whole family born again new nature ready for the rapture coming into heaven this is the goal of god it will never change we got it the problem is is we're not there we've been there we get out of there and then we get caught up in the vanity of our own mind amen verse 4 for he that cometh preaching another jesus whom we have not preached or if you receive another spirit which ye have not received or another gospel which you have not accepted he might bear with him the simplicity is stay with the word that god has given you stay with it amen don't let satan entice you to an easier way to serve god with another spirit another gospel another jesus another person's opinion about things develop the reality that god is speaking to your heart in church you know we become we have lost the fear of the lord this is why things got out of order in our church because we don't think we need the fear of god when we come into church pick and choose what we want to take like some smorgasbord what about finding out where you're at how god thinks about you the only way that's ever going to happen is you literally have to lay your heart there and say god speak to my conscience but sometimes our conscience becomes so hard that we got to do what the prophet said pinch it get it get it moving galatians chapter 1 verse 6 i marvel that ye are so s soon removed from him that called you into the grace of christ unto another gospel see how soon we can be moved you know up and down people are up and down on fire quit on fire quit it's not the holy ghost friends god does not want us so soon removed to another gospel but paul making it real clear to the galatians which is not another but there be some that trouble you and would pervert the gospel of christ now that word pervert it means to change from one nature to another in other words you started on the straight narrow path you've been shown the right way to walk but then your nature begins to shift towards the easier way the broad way right the the way that leads to destruction right amen of doing things verse 8 but though we though we or an angel we could say right here though brother bruce or i amen or an angel from heaven preach any other gospel unto you than that which ye than which we have preached unto you let him be accursed amen now that's pretty strong that isn't just you know pat him on the back and say it's okay accursed how important is the word well let's read verse nine as we said before so i now i say again if any man preach any other gospel unto you then that ye have received let him be accursed this very subject came up in heaven when brother branham went beyond the curtain of time is paul going to make it yeah paul make it well wow that's good because i preached the same thing paul preached we've got to stay with the word of god amen see satan knows satan knows that there's nobody going to stand behind this pulpit and and get you to get off the mark so he works in your personal life right it's true he entices you with an easier way in your personal life that you can come to church and not even be prepared we need to be careful about what we say to others and what we perceive that others are saying to us we don't want to be nice to a spirit that's trying to pervert us from walking in the carnality of our minds amen verse 10 for do i now persuade men or god or do i seek to please men for if i yet please men i should not be the servant of christ satan is always trying to get us walk in the vanity of our mind that's right that's a place where we're always right in our own eyes the place where we fulfill the desires of the flesh and paul talked about it in ephesians chapter 2 verse 3 among whom also we've all had our conversations in times past and the lusts of the flesh fulfilling the desires of the flesh and the mind and we're by nature the children of wrath as others but god who's rich in mercy for his great love with he loved us even when we were dead and our sins have quickened us together with christ see it it's the quickening that snaps us out of that yes and puts us in the right place but it's not just about our salvation it's about our walk with god and has raised us up together and made us to sit together in heavenly places see most carnal way of thinking is i'm saved that's all that matters everything else is just do's and don'ts and rules and not really that necessary to follow but what you're doing is you're describing your attitude about the walk that god wants to have with you and look this message for the bride isn't for everybody it is okay for those that do not want to walk this word it's okay amen god isn't gonna force anything amen but it's important for us to understand we cannot be bride we cannot be predestined and continue to walk in the carnality of our mind amen it just ain't gonna work by default by nature that we're born with it's so easy to sit back into fulfilling the desires of our flesh and of our mind and that's why jesus warned us that we need to be to put forth the effort to deny yourself to pick up a cross daily to prepare for god like we would for church every single day even though we're not going to church i'm preparing for god amen i'm dying i'm denying my will lord may your will be done in your life today amen this i say and testify in the lord that he henceforth walk not as other gentiles walk in the vanity of their mind that word vanity it means uselessness temporary not lasting not during and not permanent that's what vanity means think about all the things that you do that are temporal that you labor for that you exercise for now what god has given us he has given us a kingdom that cannot be moved amen it's not temporal it's lasting amen but we live in this world we have to deal with the things of the world but we're your desires are you hunting for more than you want i mean more than you need when we're walking with the mind of god we're setting our affections on things above permanent things when we're walking without the mind of god our thoughts become more vain and more set more on temporal things when we look at solomon who who was known for his wisdom he ultimately had the highest form of intelligence from god in ecclesiastes chapter 1 verse 2 the man said vanity of vanity saith the preacher vanity of vanities all is vanity made it real clear verse 14 he said i have seen all the works that are done under the sun and behold all is vanity and vexation of spirit amen here's a man that experienced it all i wrote down a few of the things that he did solomon did great works he built houses he planted vineyards he made gardens orchard greenhouses he planted trees of all corn all kinds of fruits he dug ponds what if he had fountains in them he engineered sprinkler systems irrigation systems he had servants and maids and he gathered silver and gold and treasures from all over the world he had all kinds of singing groups and orchestras and he concluded that all the things that was in his mind to do was all vanity and he encouraged us don't set your things on temporal things solomon did not encourage us to walk as other gentiles walk in the vanity of their own mind he did not encourage us to do the things that he did not on the contrary like jesus said after all these things do the gentiles seek but seek ye first the kingdom of god and his righteousness and all these things shall be added unto you amen it's amazing what happens when you put god first that's what solomon really did he just wanted to know how he could do the job that god gave him to do give him what it took to do the job amen and god looked at that this is not normal it's not normal you're not asking for something for you you're asking for something to help you with the purpose that i've called you for because your heart is right because your attitude is right i'm going to give you what you asked for and more right what an example seek ye first the kingdom and all other things shall be added unto you solomon told us to seek more permanent things god's word is permanent amen without the revelation of his word we are in darkness that's what we read ecclesiastes chapter 11 verse 1 solomon now after you have in all this experience he's pointing us to the mind of christ he said cast thy bread upon the waters for thou shalt find it after many days well brother john you just gave me another job to do no i didn't it god did you can cast it out look for the easier way or you can start getting serious about the word of god this is the kingdom of god when you cast your bread upon the water amen give a portion to seven and also to eight for thou knowest what covet shall come upon the face of the earth i mean it's only getting worse say there's a little relief that comes from this thing maybe there is i don't know but i'm telling you it's going downhill look at all the stuff that's happening word teaches us that the most important things in life are saving them that are lost and getting those who are saved to the image of christ that's it those are the most important things solomon concluded after all his many years of research into life for us to understand clearly what's the most important things and he he start i want to start with this in ecclesiastes chapter 12 verse 7 he says then shall the dust return to the earth as it was and the spirit shall return unto god who gave it vanity of vanities say at the preacher all is value this is the end of the book so he starts off with giving that message at the beginning and he's saying it at the end and moreover because the preacher was wise he still taught the people knowledge yay he gave good heed and sought out and set in order many proverbs the preacher sought to find out acceptable words that which was written was upright and even words of truth the words of the wise are as gourds and as nails fastened by the masters of assembly which are given from one shepherd and further by these my son be admonished of making many books there is no end ain't that the truth just get done you want to make another one we got more books no end and much studying is weariness of the flesh that is the truth but let us hear the conclusion of the whole manner what in the world we come to church for fear god and keep his commandments for this is the whole duty of man amen we need the mind of god in order to keep his commandments otherwise we're going to let satan take talk us out of it amen fear god keep his commandment this sounds like a permanent thing for god shall bring every work into judgment every secret thing whether it's to be good or whether it be evil walking without the mind of god in simplicity is all vanity it's vain and often times we walk in this world without the mind of god amen we can even walk right into church without the mind of god and not even recognize it amen which could make our church experience also in vain temporal useless meaningless especially when you walk in the church and say well i didn't get what i wanted right hey let's get this thing over with i got things to do today you're making church temporal with an attitude that's in vain a carnal mindset amen whoa unto me ever to come into a church when somebody's preaching and to say that i didn't meet god woe unto me i would never do that there's a lot of things that could be vain about church not caring about preparation humbling ourselves before the word remember when the word fell on any ground except good ground it was in vain right there were four types of ground four types of heart condition that we can have a heart condition that could be in vain praying repetitious prayers are in vain it's vain to come to church without wanting to know where you're really at with god because god wants you to know what you don't know why because you may have been walking as other gentiles have been walking in the vanity of their own mind that week it's vain to come to church without willing to suffer to see yourself change in other words you're looking for the easier way just give me some head knowledge give me something i never heard before something i never learned before and now i i can feel like i i know god more but if you're not living it more you really don't know it more amen it's vain to come to church and worship god in the vanity of your own mind jesus said in vain do they worship me the father seeketh such that will worship me in spirit and truth that don't happen and just exactly how you do it it's where the condition of your heart your mind is at when you're expressing i love you jesus amen we could be sitting in church and it'd be in vain and not even realize it there's all this hounding about being prepared it's important amen amen i'm telling you if you were going to meet somebody very very special you would prepare for it jesus said hey i'm coming soon it's special get ready don't just say i know jesus is coming soon therefore i'm ready he said be ready be ready this message makes us ready it's vain to walk into church like other gentiles thinking how great they are luke chapter 22 verse 24. here's some some strife that happened in the church and there was also a strife among them which of them should be accounted the greatest and he said unto them now notice the words that jesus says here the kings of the gentiles exercise lordship over them and they that exercise authority upon them are called benefactors but ye shall not be so walk not as other gentiles walk in the vanity of their mind having their understanding darkened being alienated from the life that is in god amen but he that is greatest among you let him be as the younger and he that is chief as he that does serve for whether it is greater he that says that me or he that serveth is not he that says that meat obviously but i among you as one that servant if we're not here as one that serveth our understanding is darkened if we're not living a life of serving the life of god is really not there because the life of god serves right how is it going to be different in you than it was in jesus amen well i just don't feel god has called me to you know bend down and wash somebody's feet hey if he did would you hear it how many feet have you washed this week how many of you served this week the mind of christ is so much different than our carnal mind carnality will always bring division in a church in a home in a business in a family when we're walking without the mind of god we open ourselves up to all sorts of carnal behaviors and when we're divided with christ we're actually we have a good chance of being causing division causing division among one another right amen because the spirit in us is not right first corinthians chapter 1 verse 12 first corinthians chapter 1 verse 12 now this i say that every one of you that sayeth i am a paul and i'm apollos i'm a cephas and i'm of christ is christ divided no way was paul crucified for you no way or were ye baptized in the name of paul no way so what is this i am of this and i'm of that and i like this church and i i like you know that church i like you know i like live streaming this other place over here now i beseech you brethren by the name of the lord jesus christ that ye all speak the same thing now this is the mind of christ right now to walk without this is to walk without the mind of christ that ye all speak the same thing that ye that there be no divisions among you and that ye be perfectly joined together in the same mind and having the same judgment amen makes it pretty clear amen what the mind of god is and when we're not walking with the mind of god we could care less with other people there should be a yearning in every one of us to be joined together perfectly we're the body of christ and if your heart's not there your heart's not right how you expect to become bride when the condition of the heart isn't right it's carnal galatians chapter 5 verse 14 for all the laws fulfilled in one word even this that thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself but if ye bite and devour one another take heed that you be not consumed one of another. this i say then walk in the spirit this is the mind of christ now and ye shall not fulfill the lust of the flesh that division that i'm right you're wrong for the flesh lusteth against the spirit the spirit against the flesh and these are contrary the one to another so that they cannot do the things that ye would there's very few people in this age that we're living in that are walking in the spirit amen there's talk about religion and there are people fill the churches but there are very few people walking in the spirit there's very few people are allowing this word to impregnate them imagine for a moment that you got hired in to a job and when you came in they told you what you were going to do you're going to do this and you're going to do this and this after you get it done there's no there's nothing more to do it's already done it don't need to be done again it don't need to be done the next day it's done now when you go into work you expect to do the next thing that they want you to do but satan wants us to think that you know once we're saved we're always saved and there's nothing more to do my god has many things to tell us but we got to have a heart to want it god i really want to be in your image i'm so sick of myself i'm my greatest enemy we got to want the word to pregnant us why so we can go live it when we leave here amen not just become a head knowledge in the message the invisible union of the bride brother brandon says that's what eve took she was pregnant with that kind of impregnation that's what the church is today now speaking of the worldly church by bible schools and intellectuals and look everyone disagreeing with the other what did we just read he said it's a big mess just exactly what the bible says of babylon impregnated with the wrong thing amen amen keep up with the joneses i'm better than this church i'm but this church is better than that church i like this brother brandon says the bride knows where she stands she is very few he says there won't be many saved just a very very very few right you say well there they said there's thousands brother ben says yes but they come up through 2 000 years too on every age where it come out of i want you to think about this brother branham taught us about this pyramid here and as you get closer to the top it gets more narrow you can feel a lot of people on faith but you can't cram all those people into that top so as each age came and went it became harder as god was building the building this is the hardest age of all ages to live the word because more word has been given amen you've got to get your mind off the carnality of just i believe and i'm saved i'm no this age is becoming his image this is the age where you can love your enemy you can lay down your life for everybody amen much harder to live this age that's why very few make it in the message to choosing of a bride the mark of the beast when she forms that world council of churches and she'll give birth to her son the antichrist now the other is impregnated by the word of god and we'll bring forth the body the finished body of jesus christ which is the bride the body of christ isn't finished yet let that sink in how many knows that a man and a woman is one the christ is one body and christ is one body the word and the bride will have to be the rest of that body and the two together makes the one body again like adam was at the beginning man his wife are one and now she the true bride is so listen to this is so sold out to him yes that she uses no mind of her own his mind of course is his will and his will is his word she becomes sold out to the word so now it's very important what that prophet said it's very important what that word says is very important now because she is sowed out to it she's become pregnated and she don't no longer carry the attitude well that's good for you but i'm going to serve god my way that's okay that is really okay if you're not bride but that is not the nature of the bride it's not the attitude of the bride in the message pergamos church age he says notice the harmony of the father and the son jesus never did anything until first shown him by the father and he gives john 5 19. now he said this harmony is now to exist between the groom and his bride he shows her his word of life i love that he shows her that's what happens at church come to church and we're hearing the word of life he shows it to her she receives it she never doubts it therefore nothing can harm her not even death for if the seed be planted the water will raise it up again now he said here is the secret of this the word is in the bride as it was in mary the bride has the mind of christ for she knows what he wants done with the word amen for she knows what he wants done with the word she has the mind of christ it's a reality that's why you just can't pick and choose what you want out of church or just say well church is over and i'm going to go do my own thing now hopefully when i go to church i'll get something of an experience with god no the experience what we what we want with god is that this word becomes impregnated in us and we can manifest it out to the world that means more than any experience you could have in church amen to better live this life out there is what god is looking for it's the secret of this whole thing walking without the mind of christ can make this church be like any other denominational church true just coming in here making church what we want to be it ain't what we want it to be honestly you remember how it was when you first stepped into a church maybe you hadn't been there in a while you just stepped into church you're just like feeling a little nervous uncomfortable i wonder what they're gonna that's the way we need to come into church every day fear of the lord i understand that we should come boldly and we should come rejoicing we should enter his gates with thanksgiving i understand all that but if you have that without the fear of the lord what you have is a bunch of denominations that want to entertain have the lights flashing the groups going and all right now we're going to have this and before you know it is they're projecting themselves their image amen nothing about the image of christ the word the word the word the word this is what we need and not just to hear it but to want to live it me jesus in the bedroom right don't just stay in the kitchen don't just sit in the back and hear the word he said get intimate with him i love this here's the secret the word is in the bride the bride has the mind of christ for she knows what he wants done with the word she performs the command of the word in his name for she has thus saith the lord then the word is quickened notice this the word that's in her now is quickened by the spirit and it comes to pass so something has to make that word live in you and what that is is the holy ghost like a seed that's planted and watered it comes to full harvest serving its purpose so there's a reason that god wants you to have the word inside you those in the bride do only his will no one can make them do otherwise they have thus saith the lord or they keep still they know that it has to be god in them doing the works fulfilling his own word he did not complete all his works while it was hit while in his earthly ministry so now he works in you amen through the bride he's working in you right now she knows that for it was not yet time for him to do certain things that he must now do but he will now fulfill to the bride that work which he left for this specific time isn't that beautiful so beautiful i'd like to if i could just read a little bit here we've got some time we're not having two services right so i figured we could just put you know two hours you know oh i won't do that but turn with me to ephesians chapter four we're talking about not walking in the vanity of our own mind as other gentiles does other so we say so-called believers do but what is the mind of christ what is it because i know that if i don't walk right i'm not worthy if i keep walking and doing the things that i've always done because each day or each short period of time god's given me something more to to walk in and i got to do it i got to become pregnant with this word that he's given me or that he's opened up to me it's not like it's a new word but he comes new to me because it becomes personal to me and you got to remember we're not down at the bottom we're up at the top this is the word that the bride must become in this age let's start with verse number one of ephesians chapter 4 i therefore the prisoner of the lord beseech you that you walk worthy of the vocation wherewith you're called not like other gentiles in the vanity of their mind you don't walk like them but you walk worthy of what i've called you to now what is that what is that wow look at the simplicity of this get pregnant with this with all lowliness and meekness with long suffering for bearing one another in love endeavoring to keep the unity of the spirit in the bond of peace wow didn't we just read all that so simple but this is not a gift it's an endeavoring somebody rises up against you during the flesh they're in their carnality you got to endeavor to keep that unity amen you you got to keep that bond to peace you got to forebear with one another you'll be long suffering with one another because they're not right you got to remember it's your walk you're walking worthy it's not the action that happens to you but it's how you react towards it amen it's your walk not theirs we can we could always say it was obvious something's wrong with them they shouldn't have done that they shouldn't have said that they shouldn't act like that that's real easy we can identify that it's wrong but can we identify the word be impregnated in us how to deal with that how to restore that amen how to keep that from escalating out of the way he goes on to say there is one body one spirit even as you are called into one hope of your calling one lord one faith one baptism one god and father of all who is above all and through all and in you all one one one one one one one one one one one is christ divided one one see how hard it is to be one with somebody our carnal mind is the only way i can be one with mark is that he has to like everything i like do everything i do have like the same songs the same colors everything's got to be what i like and then we're one right but christ is you you bend you endeavor to keep the unity you be longsuffering you be forbearing now it's not me liking mark's colors or his pecan pie because i may don't have taste buds for it but it's me becoming christ to him the character of christ we all can have that and be totally different what cars we have what we what we want to do and what things we colors we like and all that stuff but see the carnal mind says well i just i don't get along with that person and i just you know you know i just how to handle that and just to kind of leave that you know what something is wrong because today there's nothing stopping us from being one with one another as we are with christ not a thing amen as christ is one with you don't you think you can be that same one with another person the only way it can happen is for you to have the same spirit that christ has towards you now remember because you feel that you're one with christ it doesn't mean you're just like jesus you've got so many pitfalls and faults and problems and mistakes but yet you're one with christ and you'll claim that with all your faults why can't we do that with one another amen you just gotta have the same attitude that christ has towards you towards one another amen one one one one we're one i will bend over backwards to stay one i'll never forget because i i've shared this with you before maybe some of you haven't heard but when i first started in business i i thought it would be a good thing to hire somebody that knew a little bit more about me in machining than i did because we could do more right another one that'd be a good idea if you want to machine stuff and you don't know how to machine it you should hire somebody like if i have i don't know how to put cars together i'd probably call brother bruce if i had a problem so would you brother mark and so i i i was more than fair i bought him two boxes i just i gave and gave and gave because i appreciated what he was doing to help build the business uh but he had the hardest time submitting hard the hardest time and i said well it's okay if we don't do it my way but one thing's for sure we're going to do it together even if we're going to do it your way get the unity always in our shop no matter what now it wasn't the right way a lot of times and this still happens to this day like my guys they want to do things a certain way they get an idea well you can't micromanage people you gotta let them do their job but i remember after about eight years and i wanted this person to just find something that he could just rally behind a boss and and kind of be in unity that way he didn't want to leave after that but i had already made up my mind and this is really what i felt the lord wanted and honestly in our ninth year our business doubled in one year after that spirit left one year unity is important yes amen very important they were in one mine and one accord it's okay that you don't like my shoes it's okay it's okay for me not to like what you like it's not okay for you to have a different spirit than christ it's not okay don't go there produce christ to me i produce christ to you we're one we're one we're one man verse seven but unto every one of us is given grace according to the measure of the gift of christ wherefore he saith when he ascended on high and led captivity captive and gave gifts unto men now that he ascended what is it but that he also descended first to lower parts of the earth he that descended is the same also that ascended up far above all heavens that he might fill all things and he gave to us is this beautiful he gave to us a five-fold ministry he gave us the word he gave us an avenue in which the word can pregnant us to where we can become more like christ not get more what we want it's hard sometimes to separate the flesh from the image of christ but he gave us a five-fold ministry the bible says verse 12 for the perfecting of us that's right amen for the work of the ministry for the edifying of the body of christ till we all come in to unity of the faith that's right amen don't change my my mind about pink bowel bottoms wash my feet so i can see better clothes i need to wear one thing to say you need to change you need to and it's another thing spend some time helping me and of the knowledge of the son of god unto a perfect man on to the measure the statue of the fullness of christ that we henceforth be no more children tossed over here over here one day this one day that this is what i think carried about with every wind well the way that i look at it every wind of doctrine by the slight of men and cunning craftiness whereby they lie and wait to deceive you notice certain people they look for opportunities to say what they want to say just speak the truth in love amen may grow up into him in all things which is the head even christ from whom the whole body is fitly joined together compacted by that which every joint it supplies something to help the body according to the effectual working in the measure of every part making increase making increase of the body onto the edifying of itself in love can you imagine coming to church and just edifying somebody increasing somebody you don't got to stand by the pulpit to do that right right all you got to do is just wait after service and express christ to somebody lift christ up lift the word up edify one another this i say therefore testify in testifying in the lord that ye hands forth walk not as other gentiles walk in the vanity of their own mind in other words they're they don't they don't do what we just read other gentiles it's all about who's the greatest right it's all about them individually but us we're all one together we're we're a body the ministry is to make us more one amen we want to become the word that we hear we don't want this word to fit our carnal mind we want our mind to become this word amen let's stand together praise the lord for the mind of christ praise the lord that the bride has the mind of christ and that she knows what he wants done with the word we just heard the word he wants us to be long-suffering he wants us to endeavor work harder to bring unity not endeavor to show that we're right god is hidden in simplicity you know this there's no way in the world you would ever want to give your children something greater if they can't handle what they're doing she just you just don't want to do that so a lot of times when we look at the things that god asked us to do they could be very simple just they could be just church attendance it could be real simple it could be just just pray daily whatever it might be we think it's not that big a deal but it's those little things that that if we're just faithful god will give us more do you believe that i believe that with all my heart i i don't i don't think we should kind of separate the important things of god to the things that are not important with god the whole word is important to god faithfulness is important to god amen wherever you see yourself today in your walk with god in your in your mind take the things that god has spoken to you and just ask god to pregnant it make it real make it stick so that you're able to become this word one thing is for sure you could hear it a thousand times and never become it if you don't want it but if you want it you hunger your thirst you want to live it that's the opening of your heart changing your nature don't let any other gospel message idea come to you it's a wrong spirit let it be accursed stay with the word that god has given us amen let's bow in a word of prayer heavenly father we come to you as a body one a body of one your bride lord we want to thank you for sending your prophet with a message to make us one with you lord if he wouldn't have came and we wouldn't or heard this message we would be out in one of the other denominations at best or non-denominational church trying to find who you are and what really truth is but today lord we can stand here without a shadow of a doubt we know you are your word and your prophet said that your bride who we by your grace claim to be knows where we stand today we're standing upon the unmovable word of god that we have your mind we know what you want us to do with your word and that's to live it to take this word and live it that others might receive you that might come to know you and live the same word that we're living lord we thank you for challenging all of us up higher to become more in your image we thank you that there is a walk that's higher than the walk that we're walking today for us to attain to that to to grow into the deeper deeper as the song goes you for the deep calling may our spirit respond lord i pray for every heart here today lord wherever they're standing with you where ever you've spoken to to them lord may they respond with openness eagerness willingness to be one with your word and to to to put more emphasis on living the word that you've given them lord if there's word that they haven't received but they've kind of just put it to the side i pray that you would bless them that they would open their heart that you may impregnate them with that word they could bring forth the image that you've called us that you predestinated us to be in this hour we thank you for these things heavenly father and i'll also pray together with my brothers and sisters lord for the things that would be on the hearts of your people lord the things that you're also concerned about because you are touched by the feelings of our infirmities lord i pray that you would meet every need i pray that you would give faith to lay claim of every promise the things the battles that they are going through may you sustain them may you keep them may the word that they have received be such a strength to them that they could resist the enemy and all his lies all his tactics pray that you would be the the wisdom of solomon in every household on every job lord be in every relationship that we have with one another to fear you to keep your commandments to keep focused on the prize the conclusion of the whole matter we commit ourself into your hands we thank you for bringing us thus far in the journey and we thank you for
