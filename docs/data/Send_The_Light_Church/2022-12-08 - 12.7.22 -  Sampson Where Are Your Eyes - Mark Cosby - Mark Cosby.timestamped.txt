[34:42] standing too long and they've been

[34:44] judges 16 verse 4. so the Titleist
[34:47] little message is Sampson where are your
[34:50] eyes I know it's a a weird title but
[34:53] we'll get more into that is later the
[34:54] Lord is dealing this subject with me
[34:56] actually earlier this year probably
[34:57] January and he just directed me a
[35:00] different way uh other other messages
[35:02] before this message but he brought me
[35:04] back to this message so the Lord knows
[35:06] this timing so
[35:07] with his trust in him
[35:10] so judges 16
[35:13] we're gonna read a couple couple verses
[35:15] and let you sit down because it's kind
[35:16] of lengthy I want you to stand for the
[35:18] whole entire thing
[35:19] so verse 4 and it came to pass afterward
[35:22] that he loved a woman in the valley of
[35:24] soric whose name was Delilah and the
[35:27] Lords of the Philistines came up unto
[35:29] her and said unto her entice him and see
[35:32] whether in his great strength lieth and
[35:34] by what means we may prevail against him
[35:36] that we may bind him to afflict him and
[35:39] will give thee every one of us 1100
[35:42] pieces of silver that's a lot of money
[35:44] and Delilah said to Samson tell me I
[35:47] pray thee wherein thy great strength
[35:49] life and wherewithal might be bound to
[35:52] afflict thee verse 7 in Sam to send her
[35:56] if they bind me with seven green wisps
[35:58] that were never dried then I shall be
[36:00] weak and be as another man verse 8 the
[36:03] Lords of the Philistines brought up to
[36:05] her seven green whiffs which had not
[36:07] been dried and she bound him with them
[36:09] now there were men lying in wait abiding
[36:12] with her in the chamber and said unto
[36:14] him the Philistines be upon these Samson
[36:16] and break the Wist as a threat of toe
[36:18] was broken when it touched the fire so
[36:21] his strength was not known and Delilah
[36:23] said in the Samson behold thou has
[36:25] mocked me and told me lies now tell me I
[36:28] pray thee wherewith thou mightest be
[36:30] bound verse 11 and he said in her if
[36:33] they abide me fast with new ropes that
[36:35] never were occupied then shall be weak
[36:37] and be as other man verse 12. Delilah
[36:41] therefore took new ropes and bound him
[36:43] there with and said unto him the
[36:45] Philistines be upon thee Samson
[36:48] but in the chamber and he break them
[36:50] from off his arms like a threat and
[36:52] Delilah said in the Samson hither
[36:53] thouest mocked me and told me lies tell
[36:56] me wherewith thou mightest be bound and
[36:58] he said unto her if I weavest the Seven
[37:00] Locks of my with my web notice it was
[37:02] getting closer and closer to his
[37:04] god-given gift and she fashioned it with
[37:07] the pen and said to him the Phil seems
[37:09] to be upon me and he waking out his
[37:11] sleep and went away with the pin of the
[37:13] beam and with the web verse 15. and he
[37:15] and she said unto him how Kenneth thou
[37:18] say I love thee when thy heart is not
[37:20] with me thouest mock me these three
[37:22] times and has told me we're in thy great
[37:24] strength life verse 16 and it came to
[37:27] pass when she pressed him daily with her
[37:30] words and urged him so the soul was
[37:32] vexed unto death maybe see you don't
[37:34] want to keep standing too long but I
[37:36] always point this out notice Samson was
[37:39] constantly flirting with Delilah we
[37:42] could say the world he was constantly
[37:44] playing games with her see Samson had a
[37:46] issue he had a woman problem a woman
[37:49] Chaser we could say that issue and
[37:52] Samson was constantly he had he said if
[37:54] verse 4 even says he loved this woman
[37:57] and so Samson was constantly trying to
[38:00] play with Delilah not realizing that he
[38:03] was slowly his eyes were getting blinded
[38:05] his spiritual eyes were getting blinded
[38:07] to the things of God and him not even
[38:09] realized that's how sin works it creeps
[38:11] in
[38:12] unawares and if you don't do anything
[38:14] about it it will take you to places that
[38:17] you don't want to go that's what that's
[38:19] what corruption does
[38:21] so let's keep it going so we've noticed
[38:23] and it came to pass when she pressed him
[38:26] daily she was constantly impressing him
[38:28] daily what is your secret what is your
[38:30] secret is your secret where's your
[38:31] secret
[38:32] and it says with her words and urged him
[38:34] so it vexed his soul unto death
[38:38] just like a lot it said his righteous
[38:40] Soul was vexed daily so it may not have
[38:43] affected a lot at the at the get-go but
[38:45] as the days went on the months one of
[38:47] the years went on it changed him
[38:50] verse 17 then he told her all his heart
[38:54] and said unto her there hath not a razor
[38:57] come upon my head for I've been in
[38:59] Nazarite until God from my mother's womb
[39:01] if I be shaving then my strength will go
[39:04] from me and I shall become weak and be
[39:06] like any other man verse 18 and when
[39:09] Delilah saw that he had told her all his
[39:11] heart she sent and called for the Lords
[39:14] of the Philistines to say come up this
[39:16] once for you showed me all his heart and
[39:19] the Lords of the Philistines came up
[39:21] unto her and brought money in their hand
[39:23] and she made him sleep upon her knees
[39:25] and she called for a man and she calls
[39:28] him to shave off the Seven Locks of his
[39:30] head and she began to afflict him and
[39:33] his strength went from him verse 20 and
[39:36] she said the Philistines be upon thee
[39:38] Samson and he'll walk out of his sleep
[39:40] and said I will go out as other times
[39:43] before and shake myself
[39:45] and he wished not the Lord was departed
[39:47] from him so that last verse right there
[39:49] he didn't even know the Lord was
[39:51] departed from him he was so far gone so
[39:54] caught up in his the cares of this life
[39:57] the lust of the flesh the pride of life
[39:58] that he even realized the Lord was gone
[40:01] from him he thought he was still in the
[40:03] will of the Lord doing the and the Lord
[40:05] was still with him but his strength was
[40:07] gone from him and notice this out notice
[40:09] right here verse 21 but the Philistines
[40:12] took him and put his eyes out
[40:14] so he not only he loses spiritual eyes
[40:17] we're blinded but his natural eyes got
[40:19] put out all because of that one decision
[40:21] that he made he chose to to do what felt
[40:25] good to the flesh to stimulate the flesh
[40:27] it made it felt good but Samson didn't
[40:29] count the cost he didn't count that it
[40:32] would bring him this far that's what
[40:34] corruption would do that's where sin
[40:36] will do to you it may bring pleasure it
[40:39] may give you money and fame and all
[40:41] these things it may feel good but the
[40:43] end of it is death
[40:46] let's keep it going
[40:48] so verse 21 but the Philistines took him
[40:50] put his eyes out and brought him down to
[40:52] Gaza and bought him with feathers of
[40:54] brass and he did grind in the prison
[40:56] house howbeat the hair of his head began
[40:58] to grow
[40:59] after he was shaving
[41:01] so a man of God was put in mockery and
[41:04] embarrassment all because of one bad
[41:07] decision
[41:08] one bad decision he made to stay with
[41:10] this girl who was no good for him his
[41:13] parents warned him maybe even his Pastor
[41:15] warned him but he chose to do what felt
[41:18] good to the Flesh and we can get caught
[41:20] up in the same thing you may say brother
[41:22] Mark
[41:23] I'm not chasing after men or women
[41:25] but what Delilah is the type of the
[41:27] world what thing in the world are you
[41:29] chasing after that is taking you away
[41:31] from God Amen it may not be a a
[41:34] substantial thing you may notice now but
[41:36] the devil is constantly getting inches
[41:38] in your life and those inches will turn
[41:40] into miles
[41:42] so what what is in that in that Samson a
[41:45] woman chase her sure he was arrogant
[41:47] disobedient to his father and mother
[41:48] they told him not to go down there with
[41:51] that woman that Jezebel but he wouldn't
[41:53] listen to them what was it Samson had
[41:55] strength now listen Samson was willing
[41:58] to submit his strength
[42:00] Samson gave his strength to God but gave
[42:02] his heart to Delilah so notice he gave
[42:04] something to God but what God wants is
[42:07] our heart
[42:09] we can give God so many things but what
[42:11] God is looking for what's going to
[42:13] solidify everything in your life has
[42:15] given him your heart not just a one-time
[42:17] thing but a daily basis and if Samson
[42:20] gave his heart to God he would have
[42:22] avoided the way he had to go out he had
[42:25] to give his life in order to fulfill the
[42:28] purpose that God had for his life
[42:31] so that was I don't believe that was
[42:33] God's perfect will for him to do that
[42:35] but he had to go through the Proviso
[42:36] will to get to the perfect will
[42:38] and the same thing in our lives God if
[42:41] you're a child of God you're going to
[42:43] come one way or the other
[42:44] you can be dragged or you could just
[42:46] come now
[42:47] so my thing is surrender now don't wait
[42:50] don't wait until tomorrow wait till
[42:51] right now God is moving right now
[42:56] he found one in that day of Noah out of
[42:58] the tens and millions and millions
[43:00] people there's so many people like
[43:02] Samson today
[43:03] Samson gave God his strength but he
[43:05] wouldn't give him his heart God used his
[43:08] strength but not his heart Samson was
[43:10] somewhat a ladies man you know he just
[43:12] couldn't give him his heart he had to
[43:14] give it to Delilah but he gave his
[43:16] strength to God God used his strength
[43:18] but he couldn't use his heart
[43:20] that's all God wants that's what he
[43:23] wants formless he doesn't want your
[43:24] money
[43:25] he didn't want you to prestige he
[43:26] doesn't want your friends he just wants
[43:28] you that's all you want that's a desire
[43:30] from the foundation of the world he
[43:33] created a he created a perfect plan to
[43:35] bring you back to fellowship with him
[43:37] so why go any other way but his provided
[43:40] way
[43:41] God's provided way will bring peace and
[43:43] joy in your life the devil's provided
[43:46] way it will bring a temporal
[43:48] satisfaction but you're always
[43:49] constantly searching for this and that
[43:51] to fulfill that void that only Jesus can
[43:53] fulfill
[43:55] so just come to God
[43:57] don't wait until it's too late
[43:58] tomorrow's not even promised
[44:01] now we see Samson we said before he was
[44:03] flirting with Delilah which is the type
[44:05] of the world he was playing with fire
[44:07] so we see in verse 15 and 17 we read
[44:10] already that again and she said unto him
[44:12] how can it thou say I love thee she was
[44:15] seducing him with words and the devil
[44:17] likes to seduce you with things that you
[44:19] like to do which you love he knows your
[44:22] strengths and he knows your weaknesses
[44:23] he's been studying mankind for thousands
[44:26] of years so you can't fool the devil you
[44:29] can't he's he's the master of human
[44:32] intellects if we can say it that way
[44:34] he's a master of false wisdom if we
[44:36] could say it that way so he knows how to
[44:39] get in and get you off course but that's
[44:42] why it's so important for God to have
[44:45] your heart every day then the devil
[44:47] can't wiggle in and get in there because
[44:48] you've given your heart to God guys
[44:52] so we noticed that Samson made the
[44:54] biggest mistake of his life he
[44:56] compromised with the word
[44:58] and you can't even sin until first you
[45:01] lay aside God's word you can't even sin
[45:03] until that so whenever you get caught up
[45:05] in the Sin you first had to lay aside
[45:07] God's word to fulfill what felt good to
[45:10] you
[45:12] praise God let's keep it going
[45:14] so so a lot of times we constantly just
[45:16] play with fire constantly constantly
[45:18] constantly and eventually you'll get
[45:20] burned
[45:21] and why do we get so caught up in our
[45:25] own lives that we forget about God
[45:28] because we're walking in the flesh
[45:29] instead of the spirit see it's easy to
[45:31] walk in the flesh it's easy to put my
[45:33] car in cruise control and not even have
[45:36] to touch the gas pedal it's easy so our
[45:38] nature is like that we like to go on
[45:40] cruise control let's put it in default
[45:42] and just fill fill in the emotions we
[45:44] don't serve God by emotions we serve
[45:46] them by faith because emotions are like
[45:48] a roller coaster up and down
[45:50] because because happiness is based upon
[45:52] your circumstances but the joy of the
[45:55] Lord it doesn't matter the circumstance
[45:56] it doesn't matter circumstance
[45:59] so now our our eyes can also get clouded
[46:02] our spiritual eyes see Faith doesn't see
[46:05] what the these carnal eyes it sees it's
[46:08] an unseen substance that you you can't
[46:09] necessarily grab and touch it's
[46:11] something you I can't give brother John
[46:13] in a bottle and give it to them it's
[46:15] something you have to believe and know
[46:16] that's going to happen and it's due time
[46:18] that's what faith is
[46:20] so let's go to Second Corinthians
[46:24] chapter 2 verse 9 through 11.
[46:28] so these examples Samson in the Bible
[46:30] wasn't just put for some story just to
[46:32] read that's a good story but it's put
[46:34] for example for us to not follow after
[46:36] is for us to look back in the scriptures
[46:38] and see if Samson made that same mistake
[46:40] with flirting with the world
[46:42] then I need to not make that mistake I
[46:45] need to learn from his mistake
[46:47] and do the exact opposite that's what
[46:49] these scriptures are putting here for
[46:50] the when it says the examples they're in
[46:52] samples for us they're not just some
[46:54] good old story you read oh it's a good
[46:56] story uh no it's for you to actually
[46:58] look in study and see what led up to
[47:01] Samson to come to this point in his life
[47:03] see a lot of times we don't look what
[47:05] leads up to the mistakes of our life we
[47:07] say oh it's a mistake and let's move on
[47:09] but look back research study what things
[47:12] led me to making this the bad decisions
[47:15] in my life what led Samson well Samson
[47:18] never got delivered of being a woman
[47:20] chaser
[47:21] it was constantly he was always after
[47:23] women if you notice before that verse it
[47:25] says he he went into a harlot and then
[47:27] right into Delilah so all these things
[47:29] he never dealt with like but Moses he
[47:31] never dealt with his anger that's why he
[47:33] hit the rock instead of spoke to the
[47:35] Rock David same thing he had a woman
[47:37] problem as well see a lot of things see
[47:40] God can call you to a calling
[47:43] and bless you
[47:44] but you can't use that as a crutch not
[47:46] to get delivered or something that
[47:48] you've been struggling with because God
[47:50] wants to use you in a magnitude of a way
[47:52] but if you're still holding on to this
[47:55] thing shruggling with this thing say
[47:56] well it's gonna I'll put this underneath
[47:58] the rug what happened to David it came
[48:00] out what happened to Samson that came
[48:02] out and yes God forgave David but his
[48:05] relationship was never the same
[48:07] he got his son was after him it's just
[48:10] all these things that he could have
[48:12] avoided if he would have dealt with it
[48:14] from the get-go
[48:16] right so don't just think well I've been
[48:18] serving God for X number of years he's
[48:19] going to look past this thing no God
[48:22] wants to deliver you but you have to
[48:23] show him that you want Deliverance it's
[48:25] not just a magic wand he just lays old
[48:27] God just deliver me this and I'm gonna
[48:29] still hold on to it you gotta let go
[48:31] first you have to
[48:33] second Corinthians let me get there
[48:36] myself
[48:42] praise God
[48:44] so it says
[48:49] sort of verse 9. for to this end also
[48:52] they are right that I might know the
[48:53] proof of you whether you be obedient in
[48:56] all things
[48:57] to whom you forgive anything I forgive
[48:59] also
[49:00] for if I forgave anything to whom I
[49:02] forgave it for your sakes forgave it I
[49:05] in the person of Christ
[49:07] verse 11 blessed Satan get an advantage
[49:10] of us for we are not ignorant of his
[49:12] devices so the only way
[49:15] that we we can be ignorant or not
[49:18] ignorant as devices
[49:19] if we're walking in the spirit if we're
[49:22] following with the Lord is calling us
[49:23] too because Satan is cunning and crafty
[49:26] but if we're in God in his word we're
[49:29] going to be aware the scripture tells us
[49:31] to be sober and Vigilant so we are sober
[49:33] and Vigilant you're constantly looking
[49:35] Each corner because we because you you
[49:38] got to study your enemy
[49:39] your enemy study you why don't you study
[49:42] him because he's the same old devil from
[49:44] the beginning
[49:44] of the same thing he did to Adam and Eve
[49:47] he's doing to us this may be a new age
[49:50] but he's still doing the same thing the
[49:52] pride of life the lust of the flesh he
[49:53] stood in all these things it may be
[49:55] disguised and something different maybe
[49:57] disguise and being a workaholic maybe
[50:00] disguising as Samson's a woman Chaser
[50:03] may be disguised and whatever you fill
[50:06] in the blank a TV show whatever it could
[50:08] be any of those things but it's still
[50:10] the same devil so let's not be ignorant
[50:13] to his devices because Paul said right
[50:14] here he says for we are not ignorant of
[50:17] his devices
[50:18] because Paul Paul even knew Satan was
[50:21] cunning and crafty so you know what Paul
[50:23] did even after 30 years he said oh that
[50:26] I may know him
[50:27] so the more you get to know Christ
[50:30] a lot easier is going to be
[50:33] to pinpoint what the devil is trying to
[50:34] do he's trying to kill Seek and Destroy
[50:37] in the old kind of way he'll use it
[50:39] he'll
[50:40] try politics anything he'll use to try
[50:43] to kill Seek and Destroy he doesn't care
[50:44] what movement it is black lives matter
[50:46] whatever it is he doesn't care he'll use
[50:47] it in his hand
[50:50] I want to point something out in judges
[50:53] 16 verse 20. like we said before Samson
[50:55] didn't even realize that the Lord was
[50:57] departed from him imagine that he just
[51:00] assumed well the Lord called me
[51:02] I'm good to go I'm okay
[51:04] you know I'm a minister I'm okay I don't
[51:06] have to do this I don't have to pray
[51:08] today I don't have to seek the Lord out
[51:10] today I can take today off
[51:12] but look what happened to Samson
[51:14] look what happened to him that's why we
[51:16] need to be watching and praying daily
[51:19] don't don't let your in the spirit
[51:21] prayer life slip away because when you
[51:24] just pray just to check off the Box
[51:26] you're doing yourself no good
[51:28] God rather have you not even pray for
[51:30] it's going to just check off the Box God
[51:32] is looking for a Believer who wants to
[51:34] fall more in love with him God is
[51:36] looking for a Believer who wants his
[51:38] spiritual eyes open on a daily basis God
[51:41] wants to give you ears to hear but how
[51:43] can he give you ears to hear if you're
[51:44] not willing even to spend time with him
[51:46] let's go to Matthew 26 41.
[51:55] Matthew 26 41 very friendly scripture
[52:01] so Jesus speaking here in verse 41 watch
[52:04] and pray that's the two first things he
[52:07] said so if Jesus told us to watch him
[52:09] pray we should be watching and praying
[52:11] every day and he says and he gives you
[52:13] the reason why that you enter not into
[52:16] temptation
[52:17] the spirit indeed is willing but the
[52:19] flesh is weak so your inner man wants
[52:23] God he wants to serve God
[52:25] but if you're not feeding him how can he
[52:28] ever Prosper if I'm going to the gym if
[52:30] I want to go to the gym and I want to
[52:32] get fit eat healthy and all these things
[52:33] if I'm only putting one day a week in
[52:37] every month once a month I'm not going
[52:39] to grow properly I'm not going to lose
[52:41] the weight I want so I'm not getting the
[52:43] muscle I want to so the same thing with
[52:45] your spiritual walk if you're not
[52:46] putting in 24 7 hours a day
[52:49] 24 hours a day seven days a week you
[52:52] can't just come to church and expect
[52:53] your spiritual life just to grow
[52:54] abundantly it's going to come into a
[52:57] halt because God isn't looking for a
[52:59] part-time believer you know you have
[53:01] part-time workers but he's looking for a
[53:02] full-time worker a full-time believer
[53:05] who wants God on all aspects of their
[53:08] life so a lot of times willing to put
[53:10] God in certain aspects of Our Lives I
[53:13] want God in this area I want God just to
[53:15] save me from Hell or I want God to lead
[53:18] me to the house he wants me to buy out
[53:19] of the car he wants me to buy but what
[53:21] does God want to do with your life what
[53:22] what direction he's going to lead you
[53:24] how does he want to use you does he want
[53:26] maybe he doesn't want you to take that
[53:27] job with that car or maybe he wants you
[53:29] to do this
[53:31] see a lot of times we need to be asking
[53:33] God for the more important things yes
[53:34] yes he wants you to prosper in these
[53:37] other things and health and all these
[53:38] things but what about your soul
[53:40] what does God want with that what kind
[53:42] of he wants to change you so he can use
[53:44] you he can't just use you if you're not
[53:47] being changed on a daily basis that's
[53:49] what happened to many Believers many
[53:52] people leave serving God because they
[53:55] aren't seeking after the right thing he
[53:56] says seek me with all your heart amen
[54:00] amen amen let's go to Romans 8.
[54:12] so it's our reverse one
[54:16] there's therefore no now no condemnation
[54:19] to them which are in Christ Jesus
[54:22] who walk not after the flesh but after
[54:24] the spirit notice that right right off
[54:26] the bat
[54:27] is starting off heavy it's saying who
[54:30] walk not after the flesh
[54:32] but after the spirit so it showed me
[54:34] right there off the get-go that if I
[54:36] want to serve Christ in the fullness
[54:38] that he wants me to serve him I have to
[54:40] not walk after the flesh but I have to
[54:42] walk in the spirit it's the only way
[54:46] verse 2 for the law of the spirit of
[54:48] life in Christ Jesus has made me free
[54:51] from the law of sin and death
[54:54] verse 3. from what the law could not do
[54:57] and that it was weak through the flesh
[54:59] God sending his own son the likeness of
[55:02] his own son in the likeness of sinful
[55:03] flesh
[55:04] four sin condemned sin in the flesh so
[55:08] why why do we choose the way of death
[55:10] when God sent his son that we could walk
[55:13] in the way of life
[55:15] see why do we choose these things
[55:16] because when we go to the pleasures of
[55:19] sin and we get caught up in these things
[55:20] yeah sometimes we make the same mistake
[55:22] over and over again knowing that the
[55:25] same result is going to happen so why do
[55:27] we do these things
[55:28] because we're not connected properly
[55:30] with God we're not spending time in
[55:32] prayer see I tell you prayer is so key
[55:35] if you want growth in your life spend
[55:37] time on your knees let God speak back to
[55:41] your heart let God begin to deal with
[55:43] you and a lot of times God will tell us
[55:46] something to do and we don't want to do
[55:48] it then God is not obligated to say
[55:50] anything else to you until you first do
[55:53] that
[55:54] right this is truth it's the truth
[55:56] anyhow amen
[55:58] because God
[56:00] honors faithfulness as simple as that if
[56:03] you're faithful to God he'll be faithful
[56:04] to you
[56:05] it's that's how simple it is we make
[56:08] things so complicated
[56:09] God is hidden Simplicity for a reason
[56:12] a lot of times people will preach some
[56:14] guy that's out here but he's a personal
[56:16] God that wants to be in your life
[56:19] the first thing you got to do is accept
[56:21] them right
[56:22] right that's all you it's so simple
[56:24] accept them into your heart and say Lord
[56:26] I want to do whatever you want me to do
[56:27] whatever
[56:29] Direction you want in my life whatever
[56:30] things you want me to let go help me
[56:33] Lord give me the strength to let these
[56:34] things go because I want to serve you
[56:35] with everything that I have and as
[56:37] simple as that face down
[56:41] verse uh verse 4 that the righteousness
[56:44] of the law might be fulfilled in us
[56:46] that's our honor and a privilege who
[56:49] walked not after the flesh but after the
[56:51] spirit noticing he's saying the same
[56:52] thing again because that's how important
[56:54] it is verse 5 and then he goes in and
[56:57] explain for they that are after The
[56:59] Flesh do mind the things of the flesh
[57:02] but they that are after the spirit the
[57:04] things of the spirit
[57:06] for to be Carly minded is death
[57:09] but to be spiritually minded is life and
[57:12] peace so a lot of times we choose that
[57:15] first part of the sentence
[57:17] and every time it's going to bring death
[57:19] in your life and then we question why
[57:22] because you chose to to use your carnal
[57:25] mind instead of being spiritually minded
[57:28] that's why it says let this mind be in
[57:30] you that was in Christ Jesus and notice
[57:32] the mind of Christ it was to always
[57:34] please the father
[57:35] it was to be a servant to others it was
[57:38] willing to wash somebody's feet
[57:41] and that's how that that's the mind of
[57:42] Christ the mind of Christ he said I do
[57:44] nothing but the father shows me who said
[57:46] in the men's meeting
[57:48] because the carnal mind is enmity
[57:50] against God God hates our carnal nature
[57:53] our carnal mind
[57:55] for it's not subject to the law of God
[57:57] neither indeed can be
[57:59] so then they there in the flesh cannot
[58:01] please God so you can't even please God
[58:04] in your flesh
[58:06] but ye are not in the flesh but in the
[58:08] spirit if so be the spirit of God dwell
[58:11] in you that's why it's so important to
[58:13] have a nature change
[58:15] because you can't serve God
[58:18] unless you have a nature change because
[58:20] your nature
[58:22] that you're you're built with can only
[58:24] go so far you can accept God I believe
[58:27] Jesus died on the cross but thou by the
[58:29] far as it'll go
[58:31] because once again your nature and God's
[58:33] nature are night and day that's why it
[58:35] says in Ezekiel he needs to put a new
[58:37] spirit within you give you a new heart
[58:39] and then you can't stop there because he
[58:41] wants to put his Spirit In You
[58:44] see a lot of times Believers they'll get
[58:46] delivered of alcoholism cigarette
[58:48] addiction uh whatever you can name it
[58:50] you keep naming them all and they'll
[58:53] stop right there at the sanctification
[58:55] but they never go into the baptism of
[58:56] the Holy Ghost the pro the new birth
[58:58] process
[59:00] because a new birth
[59:01] you see things different
[59:03] when you when a new birth happens
[59:06] is not just all you're all said and done
[59:08] even as rest that's when the battle
[59:09] really begins that's when you really
[59:11] have to start fighting and crucifying
[59:13] the flesh
[59:14] that's what it has that's what it has to
[59:16] be that's the way that's God's provided
[59:18] way for us to get back to how we work
[59:20] that's God's provided away we're still
[59:22] in these bodies he didn't come to redeem
[59:24] these bodies but he came to redeem
[59:25] what's inside of here that's what God is
[59:28] trying to build what's inside of here
[59:30] your soul is so important to God more
[59:32] than this outward body body because he
[59:34] has a body prepared for you but right
[59:36] now we need to be focusing on what's in
[59:39] here and what's going on here is being
[59:41] is properly being filled with the right
[59:44] things then you're going to be serving
[59:46] others you're going to be washing others
[59:48] feet you're going to be feeding on
[59:50] prayer
[59:51] because you'll know I'm pretty sure all
[59:53] businesses this area where you just know
[59:56] you're struggling and you know exactly
[59:58] why you're struggling but you're not
[1:00:00] making the right effort to put the right
[1:00:02] things in to stop the struggling you
[1:00:04] just think that oh I'm gonna keep doing
[1:00:05] this and it's all going to change that's
[1:00:06] Madness if you're trying to do the same
[1:00:08] thing over again it'll be so easy if you
[1:00:11] say you know what I'm going to fix this
[1:00:12] problem right now I'm gonna spend more
[1:00:14] time in prayer I'm gonna spend more time
[1:00:15] on the word because if I don't I'm going
[1:00:17] to get further away
[1:00:19] as it'll be harder to get it's so hard
[1:00:21] once a fire is put out to relight it
[1:00:24] that's why it's so best to keep putting
[1:00:26] coal in the fire and keep feeding on the
[1:00:28] word keep praying
[1:00:30] that's how you build that fire
[1:00:32] says verse 10 and if Christ be in you
[1:00:36] the body is dead because of sin but the
[1:00:39] spirit is life because of righteousness
[1:00:41] but the spirit of him that raised up
[1:00:43] Jesus from the dead dwell in you
[1:00:46] he that raised up Christ in the dead
[1:00:47] shall also Quicken your mortal bodies by
[1:00:50] his spirit that dwelleth in you verse 12
[1:00:52] therefore brethren we are not debtors
[1:00:55] not to the flesh to live after the flesh
[1:00:57] I believe Paul said I forgot where but
[1:01:00] this Liberty that God has given us don't
[1:01:02] use it as a cloak for the flesh
[1:01:05] you have Liberty in Christ but the
[1:01:07] Liberty that the society is teaching us
[1:01:09] is not the same Liberty God is teaching
[1:01:11] us there are night and day things see
[1:01:13] Liberty he's giving you is to serve him
[1:01:15] so he can use you because at first Satan
[1:01:19] had you in his grips you're in the
[1:01:21] bondage of Satan and God took those
[1:01:24] chains off and released you and freed
[1:01:26] you now you have a choice whether you
[1:01:29] either can say Lord I can do whatever I
[1:01:32] want or Lord I'm going to do what you
[1:01:33] want me to do because you may not say
[1:01:36] those exact words and people say oh I'm
[1:01:38] still living for God but if you're doing
[1:01:40] your own thing not serving God I don't
[1:01:43] care what you say you're not serving God
[1:01:45] because if your life isn't matched in
[1:01:47] the description I understand all our
[1:01:49] lives and right now it's not mentioned
[1:01:50] in the scripture that's okay but make
[1:01:52] sure the light that God is giving you
[1:01:54] right now is matching with it that's the
[1:01:56] most important thing because if you can
[1:01:58] follow the light that God has given you
[1:01:59] right now he can give you more light to
[1:02:01] follow but if you're not following that
[1:02:03] light right now then you're gonna be
[1:02:05] blind Samson was blind his walk stop
[1:02:08] right there at that moment because he
[1:02:10] chose to to do what stimulated his flesh
[1:02:13] and oh it felt so good to him it felt so
[1:02:16] good you know him showing off for
[1:02:18] Delilah you know breaking the ropes off
[1:02:21] his arms it felt good but when the time
[1:02:23] got rough when Delilah left him she
[1:02:26] wasn't there she left you didn't hear
[1:02:29] nothing from her after that nothing
[1:02:31] so this shows you
[1:02:33] we got to make sure what we're putting
[1:02:35] all our time and investing in what what
[1:02:37] time you have invested in your life
[1:02:39] where is all your time and your
[1:02:40] resources going to
[1:02:42] it's such a key thing because we can be
[1:02:44] busy
[1:02:46] but just because you're busy doesn't
[1:02:47] mean you're going anywhere
[1:02:49] I could be running in place and sweating
[1:02:51] if I'm not going anywhere I'm in the
[1:02:53] same spot right now
[1:02:56] don't let's not do what Samson did let's
[1:02:58] not have to do unnecessary
[1:03:01] uh sufferings God yes yes we should be
[1:03:05] suffering for the right things for
[1:03:07] character not suffering for no reason
[1:03:09] because we made a stupid decision
[1:03:13] I don't care how good it feels or how
[1:03:15] right it may seem to you living in the
[1:03:17] flesh as it says ye shall die it says
[1:03:19] that in Romans Romans 8 13.
[1:03:21] it's no excuse why we should be living
[1:03:23] below our privileges it's no excuse as
[1:03:26] Sons and Daughters of God we shouldn't
[1:03:29] be God has called us to such a higher
[1:03:31] calling
[1:03:32] we don't have to live below what Satan
[1:03:35] says with live below but let's live the
[1:03:37] standards of God
[1:03:39] let's go to Galatians 5.
[1:03:45] foreign
[1:03:48] serving God for five years 10 years or a
[1:03:50] year
[1:03:52] he still wants to use you and put him
[1:03:54] put himself in you
[1:03:56] all it takes is you say Lord I Surrender
[1:03:59] I surrender all
[1:04:01] verse 14 in Galatians 5. for all the
[1:04:05] laws fulfilled in one word even in this
[1:04:07] thou shall love thy neighbor as thyself
[1:04:11] but if he bite and devour one another
[1:04:13] take heed that ye be not consumed one of
[1:04:17] another
[1:04:18] verse 16. notice how the scripture just
[1:04:21] doves till it's talking about the flesh
[1:04:22] again this I say then walk in the spirit
[1:04:25] and he shall not fulfill the lust of the
[1:04:27] flesh so notice the scripture is
[1:04:29] constantly bringing in our remembrance
[1:04:31] that we need to be walking in the spirit
[1:04:33] it's constantly bringing to our memories
[1:04:35] that our flesh is weak
[1:04:37] and if we go to default nature we'll
[1:04:39] automatically go in the flesh I always
[1:04:41] love this this quote about the white dog
[1:04:42] and a black dog it's a white dog and a
[1:04:45] black dog inside of you the white dog
[1:04:47] is your spirit man and a black dog is
[1:04:49] your fleshly man because say it that way
[1:04:51] and whatever you feed the most is what's
[1:04:53] going to come out on top so if you feed
[1:04:55] the black dog the black dog is going to
[1:04:57] come out on top if you feed the white
[1:04:58] dog the white dogs that come on top is
[1:05:00] that is it simple as that it's like if I
[1:05:02] eat pizza every day I'm going to gain
[1:05:04] weight if I eat chicken salmon
[1:05:07] vegetables juice
[1:05:09] I'm going to be healthy
[1:05:11] as simple as simple as that
[1:05:15] verse 17 for the flesh lusteth against
[1:05:18] the spirit
[1:05:20] and the spirit against the flesh so
[1:05:22] knows there's a constant war between
[1:05:23] these two in you constant War
[1:05:27] but if you be led it says
[1:05:29] Spirit against the Flesh and these are
[1:05:31] contrary the one to the other so you
[1:05:33] cannot do the things that you would but
[1:05:35] if you be led of the spirit you're not
[1:05:37] under the law
[1:05:39] now the works of the flesh are manifest
[1:05:41] which are these adultery
[1:05:43] fornication you may say well I'm not
[1:05:46] fornicating well you can also be guilty
[1:05:48] of spiritual fornication not being true
[1:05:51] to your lord and savior
[1:05:54] so it says
[1:05:56] uncleanness lasciviousness I looked that
[1:05:59] word up so it's tendency to excite lust
[1:06:02] and promote irregular indulgences
[1:06:04] indulgences
[1:06:06] that's what that means so idolatry we
[1:06:08] know idolatry means you don't have to be
[1:06:10] serving some wooden Idol but anything
[1:06:12] you put before God can become an idol
[1:06:15] your car your house your job everything
[1:06:19] can become an idol if you make it so
[1:06:21] anything you put before God is an idol
[1:06:23] in witchcraft oh I'm not practicing
[1:06:25] witchcraft witchcraft is
[1:06:29] more than just that you're actually
[1:06:31] having a relationship with Satan we can
[1:06:34] say it that way a personal walk with him
[1:06:35] if you say it that way it could be
[1:06:37] witchcraft as well it doesn't have to be
[1:06:39] sorcery and spell books but it's a
[1:06:41] little bit more than that as well
[1:06:42] hatred variance emulations Wrath
[1:06:46] Strife seditions heresies wait there's
[1:06:49] more envings murders drunkenness
[1:06:52] revealiness and such of the which I tell
[1:06:55] you before as I have also told you in
[1:06:56] time past so look how many avenues that
[1:06:59] Satan can work in amen he can work in so
[1:07:02] many Avenues in these things that can
[1:07:03] can creep up in your life
[1:07:06] so it says if I told you in time past
[1:07:08] that they which do such things shall not
[1:07:11] inherit the kingdom of God so if we're
[1:07:13] caught up in these things it could be
[1:07:15] any one of these things we can be caught
[1:07:17] up into we're not going to inherit the
[1:07:19] kingdom of God God's not just going to
[1:07:21] come because you have pretty looks and
[1:07:22] you look good and you drive a nice car
[1:07:25] he doesn't care about those things be
[1:07:26] honest with you because all those things
[1:07:27] are going to pass away
[1:07:29] but what he carries right here what he
[1:07:30] cares about is in verse 22 but the thru
[1:07:33] of the spirit is love
[1:07:35] Joy peace long-suffering gentleness
[1:07:39] goodness Faith meekness Temperance
[1:07:43] against such there is no law that's
[1:07:47] what's important are these fruits being
[1:07:50] manifested in your life on a daily basis
[1:07:53] or are these other
[1:07:55] fruits being manifested in your life
[1:07:57] that's the question we should be asking
[1:07:59] ourselves that's why brother Branham
[1:08:01] said it's important to always check your
[1:08:03] motive why are you doing what you're
[1:08:05] doing the thing that you're doing right
[1:08:07] now is it leading you to God or from God
[1:08:10] we got to be honest we got to do a
[1:08:12] self-examination in our life on a daily
[1:08:14] basis because if we do not Satan will
[1:08:16] have a field day with you he will tell
[1:08:18] you all these lies and say well you're
[1:08:20] doing good you're still serving God
[1:08:22] you're not like that other person right
[1:08:24] here who's in the bar or who's uh doing
[1:08:27] this and doing that and we get when he
[1:08:29] hits you with that you begin to feel
[1:08:31] comfortable relax lazy
[1:08:34] and the spirit of this age is to feel
[1:08:37] like that I'm in need of nothing
[1:08:40] naked poor wretched blind and not even
[1:08:43] knowing it it's all talking about the
[1:08:45] spiritual thing
[1:08:46] verse 24 then they that are Christ knows
[1:08:50] that in order to be Christ have
[1:08:52] crucified the flesh with the affections
[1:08:57] and lust verse 25 if we live in this
[1:09:00] spirit let us also walk in the spirit we
[1:09:03] know it's the children of Israel they
[1:09:05] were living in the spirit they saw all
[1:09:06] these things being done they saw Mana
[1:09:09] fall down they saw the Red Sea being
[1:09:11] parted
[1:09:12] but they never they never walked in the
[1:09:14] spirit they never took God at his word
[1:09:16] so you can live in the spirit but not
[1:09:18] walk in the spirit
[1:09:20] it's the truth you can that's why Paul
[1:09:22] said let us also walk in the spirit
[1:09:24] let's live and walk
[1:09:26] because you can be in a wonderful
[1:09:28] service where God's just moving oh it's
[1:09:30] a good service and then the next day
[1:09:31] forget all about it
[1:09:33] you were in the spirit that moment you
[1:09:35] were you were feeling it oh it was
[1:09:37] touching your heart but if you choose
[1:09:39] not to run with it then it's going to
[1:09:41] stay here at church
[1:09:44] let us not be desirous of vain Glory
[1:09:47] provoking one another and envying one
[1:09:50] another
[1:09:51] so the first step
[1:09:53] in being in the spirit is crucifying
[1:09:56] your flesh denying your will for the
[1:09:58] whole day the next step is living for
[1:10:00] others because that's what Christ did
[1:10:03] he had to deny his flesh as well and
[1:10:05] what did he do he lived for others he
[1:10:07] lived for others that they may have life
[1:10:09] so let's let's live for others that we
[1:10:12] may Point them to life amen because we
[1:10:14] may not be able to give them life
[1:10:15] personally but we can lead them to the
[1:10:18] life Giver
[1:10:19] and that's our that's our that's our our
[1:10:20] goal in our design that's what God's
[1:10:22] desire is when he fills you with the
[1:10:24] Holy Spirit is to use you to finish the
[1:10:26] works that he could not do because you
[1:10:28] and I weren't born yet amen amen so he
[1:10:30] wants to use you
[1:10:32] he'll give you he'll give you a business
[1:10:33] use that as a use that as a way to
[1:10:37] witness to somebody because when God
[1:10:39] gives you something it shouldn't take
[1:10:40] you away
[1:10:42] from police so if God blesses you
[1:10:44] something don't use it as an excuse for
[1:10:46] it to take you away from him
[1:10:48] because a lot of times well what God
[1:10:50] gave me is business I want to use it as
[1:10:51] that no don't make that excuse if God
[1:10:54] gave you something have we need to have
[1:10:56] a balance
[1:10:57] perfect balance
[1:11:01] let's go to First Corinthians chapter 6.
[1:11:08] so a balance is so key in our lives we
[1:11:11] can't have a we need to have a only a
[1:11:13] perfect balances in the Lord that's the
[1:11:14] only thing
[1:11:15] that can get you perfectly balanced and
[1:11:18] I believe a prayer life will help you
[1:11:19] with that
[1:11:21] if you don't have a prayer life you
[1:11:23] can't have a walk with God I'm sorry
[1:11:24] it's the truth
[1:11:27] you just can't that's what God's
[1:11:29] provided a way is to have personal
[1:11:30] fellowship with you
[1:11:32] he wants you to he wants to hear your
[1:11:34] heart he wants you to pour your heart
[1:11:35] out so he wants you to hide away and see
[1:11:37] don't hide away in a secret place only
[1:11:39] when times of trouble
[1:11:41] are are Awakening but getting that
[1:11:43] secret place when everything's all
[1:11:45] hunky-dory when the flowers are
[1:11:46] beautiful get in that prayer closet
[1:11:48] because a lot of times we'll wait until
[1:11:50] we get down in the valley to get in the
[1:11:52] prayer closet but let's get serious
[1:11:54] right now on the Mountaintop so when we
[1:11:56] get to the valley it won't surprise us
[1:11:58] that's how our prayer life should really
[1:11:59] be
[1:12:00] that David was a man of desperation he
[1:12:03] was desperate for God to move in his
[1:12:05] life he's desperate to hear from the
[1:12:07] Lord
[1:12:08] even even guys had a man after my own
[1:12:11] heart let's be after guys on her
[1:12:15] you go 19 through 20 verse 6.
[1:12:22] what know you not that your body is a
[1:12:25] temple of the Holy Ghost which is in you
[1:12:28] which ye have of God and you are not
[1:12:30] your own see these bodies that we have
[1:12:34] we're borrowing them they're not ours
[1:12:37] God has given you this body and he's
[1:12:39] we're going to be judged how we used our
[1:12:41] body
[1:12:42] so a lot of times we'll misuse our body
[1:12:45] to do our own will or whatever it is I I
[1:12:47] got a tattoo at one point in my life and
[1:12:50] I was convicted about getting it and I
[1:12:52] still went ahead and did it now I have
[1:12:54] to live with that first of my life did
[1:12:56] God forgive me yes but it's still a mark
[1:12:58] to remind me of what I did
[1:13:00] so it's so important it says for you are
[1:13:02] bought with a price therefore glorified
[1:13:05] God it says right here in your body and
[1:13:07] in your spirit right
[1:13:09] which are Gods so your body and your
[1:13:11] spirit are both Gods amen we come from
[1:13:14] God we go back to God Amen amen so now
[1:13:16] we're going to be judged on how we used
[1:13:18] our time see time is the most valuable
[1:13:20] currency in the world because it's
[1:13:22] something that you can't get back once
[1:13:25] you lose it
[1:13:26] so I could be here today gone tomorrow
[1:13:28] life is so short
[1:13:31] so let's use our time for the things of
[1:13:34] God for the kingdom of God that's what's
[1:13:36] gonna at the end of the desk what's
[1:13:38] gonna matter the most What's Done For
[1:13:39] Christ I could get a million awards
[1:13:43] first place but I can't like I can't say
[1:13:46] Lord you see all these first place on my
[1:13:48] wall all these trophies I got he's not
[1:13:51] going to care about that he's going to
[1:13:53] be like what'd you do what'd you do for
[1:13:54] my kingdom
[1:13:55] what would you do with your life all
[1:13:58] these things are going to pass away
[1:14:01] so we're we never forget we're bought
[1:14:02] with the price and if we crucify our
[1:14:04] flesh daily and living for others we'll
[1:14:06] recognize that that this body and spirit
[1:14:09] are for the Lord
[1:14:10] to use on a daily basis he wants to use
[1:14:13] you
[1:14:15] so I remember this is something this uh
[1:14:17] a quote brother Brandon said that uh it
[1:14:20] pertains to ministers I believe pertains
[1:14:22] to everyone there's three things I've
[1:14:24] noticed in Reading history that wrecks a
[1:14:26] Minister's life from the start one of
[1:14:28] them is money the love of it the next is
[1:14:31] popularity when he thinks he's something
[1:14:33] when he's nothing anyhow and next is
[1:14:35] women that's right
[1:14:38] man takes money women in popularity
[1:14:40] that's been three major things that
[1:14:43] God's has trouble with his children many
[1:14:45] of the other things that goes along with
[1:14:46] it too but the main thing is when God
[1:14:48] begins to bless a brother and to give
[1:14:50] him something a little more or something
[1:14:52] another to help the people then that man
[1:14:54] begins to think see who am I
[1:14:57] right then he's on the road down you
[1:14:59] want me to tell you how to get up get
[1:15:01] down
[1:15:02] that's the way up is go down he that
[1:15:04] humbles himself God will exalt is that
[1:15:07] right he exalts himself
[1:15:10] will be a beast
[1:15:12] so you may say well I'm not a minister
[1:15:13] but these things can pertain to your
[1:15:15] life God could bless you with a new job
[1:15:17] a six-figure salary whatever it may be
[1:15:19] and you can choose to either be prideful
[1:15:22] about that or be humble about it
[1:15:24] because it doesn't have to be all it
[1:15:26] could be one of these three things it
[1:15:27] could be popularity you know you can get
[1:15:29] a Ministry or whatever it is you get a
[1:15:31] nice your manager whatever it is these
[1:15:33] things can draw you away if you let them
[1:15:36] as I said before when God blesses you
[1:15:38] with something don't use his excuse
[1:15:40] for you just to go in cruise control
[1:15:43] guys expect you to be a steward over
[1:15:45] those things a steward of your time suit
[1:15:47] of your business a steward of your
[1:15:49] children all these things he's he's
[1:15:52] placed in your path for you to raise
[1:15:54] your kids in the right way now you make
[1:15:56] either one one or two choices I'm gonna
[1:15:59] serve I'm gonna raise my children the
[1:16:01] way I think or the way God wants me to
[1:16:04] see that you pick one or the other it's
[1:16:06] no Switzerland I'm gonna do one of the
[1:16:07] I'm gonna do both either you're doing
[1:16:10] God's way or Satan's way that's only two
[1:16:11] things you can do you can't mix the two
[1:16:13] because Jesus said you can't serve God
[1:16:15] in men at the same time it's impossible
[1:16:19] I think many times we are always
[1:16:22] think we're seeing things with the
[1:16:24] spiritual eye
[1:16:25] but the thing is we don't take the time
[1:16:27] to make sure that's what it says in
[1:16:29] first first John 4 1.
[1:16:32] to try this spirit
[1:16:34] says to try the spirit and see it be of
[1:16:36] me let's turn there real quick first
[1:16:38] John chapter 4.
[1:16:47] so it says verse one
[1:16:50] beloved believe not every Spirit but try
[1:16:53] the spirits whether they are of God
[1:16:56] because many false prophets are gone out
[1:16:59] into the world how many has been
[1:17:01] deceived or tricked
[1:17:03] nobody
[1:17:04] wow all right
[1:17:07] did we did we at that point in our time
[1:17:09] did we try the spirit
[1:17:12] we just assumed that we were going away
[1:17:14] God wanted us to but the scriptures play
[1:17:17] and tell us that we need says believe on
[1:17:18] every spirit
[1:17:20] try the spirits where they are of God
[1:17:22] because many false prophets are gone
[1:17:24] into the world Satan likes to act like
[1:17:26] he's God
[1:17:28] and he'll use some of the word but not
[1:17:30] all the word to deceive you he did the
[1:17:33] same thing to eat look the same
[1:17:35] Satan knows in the garden still the same
[1:17:37] Satan today still doing the same things
[1:17:40] he did the Eve that got her to disbelief
[1:17:43] one percent of the word less than one
[1:17:45] percent of the word actually
[1:17:46] laughs verse two hereby know ye the
[1:17:49] spirit of God every spirit that
[1:17:51] confesses that Jesus Christ has come in
[1:17:52] the flesh is of God
[1:17:54] and every spirit that confesses not that
[1:17:56] Jesus Christ has come in the flesh is
[1:17:57] not of God and this is that Spirit of
[1:17:59] antichrist wherefore you have heard that
[1:18:01] it should come and even now already is
[1:18:04] in the world you are the children of God
[1:18:07] little children have overcome them
[1:18:09] because greater is he that is in you
[1:18:11] than he's in the world
[1:18:13] so we play a part we can't just say well
[1:18:17] God's gonna do everything we play a part
[1:18:19] we got to be trying the spirit we got to
[1:18:21] be feeding upon the spirit of God see
[1:18:23] how you can try the spirit is you get to
[1:18:25] know God it's as I said that you get to
[1:18:28] know your enemy get to know your person
[1:18:29] your savior in a personal way and you
[1:18:32] can know the way he exactly talks to you
[1:18:34] because he's not going to talk the same
[1:18:36] way always he talks to Brother John as
[1:18:37] he talked to me he can speak to me
[1:18:39] different ways speak to sister Anna
[1:18:41] different ways brother Roger in
[1:18:42] different ways so you need to get
[1:18:44] acquainted with your personal Savior and
[1:18:47] know when he's he's talking to you
[1:18:48] personally you got to get tuned in that
[1:18:50] radio frequency so there's no static but
[1:18:53] you know that you know that you know
[1:18:54] that what he said to you also has to
[1:18:57] line up with the scriptures because
[1:18:58] God's not going to say anything that's
[1:19:00] going to disprove his word it's going to
[1:19:02] have to lie on the scriptures every time
[1:19:03] that's the dovetail
[1:19:06] let's go Revelations uh 3 15-18
[1:19:14] so we look at Samson's life he was after
[1:19:16] was Samson still doing the will of God
[1:19:18] in a way yes he was in a way but
[1:19:21] eventually it got to a point in the
[1:19:23] standstill in his life where it overcame
[1:19:25] him because Samson was after the things
[1:19:27] of the flesh that's why his spiritual
[1:19:29] eyes were put out he was still killing
[1:19:31] Philistines he was but he wasn't
[1:19:34] following God with all his heart God can
[1:19:36] still use you partially
[1:19:38] in certain ways but I want God to be
[1:19:40] able to use me to win souls that's my
[1:19:42] heart's desire because if you look in
[1:19:44] Matthew 7 . I guess to kind of validate
[1:19:46] what I just said in Matthew 7.
[1:19:49] many will come to me today say Lord Lord
[1:19:51] did we not cast out demons and heal the
[1:19:53] sick they did these things but they
[1:19:55] missed what God was calling them for was
[1:19:58] a personal walk was God using them yes
[1:20:01] but they were blinded
[1:20:03] spiritually because they assumed they
[1:20:06] were doing what God wanted to do even
[1:20:08] knowing deep in their heart they weren't
[1:20:09] notice that knowing deep in their heart
[1:20:11] they weren't they still thought that
[1:20:13] those other things could supplement for
[1:20:16] what they weren't doing
[1:20:17] and Samson taught the same thing well
[1:20:19] I'm still you know killing Philistines
[1:20:21] for God I could you know have a little
[1:20:23] fun with Delilah over here you know I
[1:20:25] love her and everything but look what
[1:20:27] happened to him so the same thing
[1:20:29] happened to him can happen to us
[1:20:31] verse 15 verse Revelations 3 15.
[1:20:35] let's go verse 14 actually jump up there
[1:20:37] and into the angel we heard this how
[1:20:39] many times we probably read these
[1:20:40] scriptures these very ones how many
[1:20:42] times probably thousands
[1:20:45] but the thing is it's not just about
[1:20:47] reading it but it's really about getting
[1:20:49] in to seeing what God was saying to this
[1:20:51] church
[1:20:52] now to the angel of the Church of
[1:20:54] laodiceans write these things saith the
[1:20:56] amen the faithful and true witness the
[1:20:59] beginning of the creation of God
[1:21:01] I Know Thy works that thou art neither
[1:21:03] cold nor hot so these believers
[1:21:07] they believe that Jesus Christ died upon
[1:21:09] the cross they believe he died for his
[1:21:11] sins they believe all these things but
[1:21:14] they had a form of godliness and they
[1:21:16] denied the power of because they were
[1:21:18] lukewarm and God hates a lukewarm
[1:21:21] believer in fact he said I'll spew it
[1:21:23] out of my mouth the Pharisees
[1:21:25] they read scripture they prayed they
[1:21:27] fasted
[1:21:29] but they weren't really Believers
[1:21:31] because he said either your father the
[1:21:33] devil that's what he told him straight
[1:21:35] up and these people they didn't they
[1:21:37] married right they didn't have
[1:21:38] fornication
[1:21:39] they did everything they thought they
[1:21:41] did everything the law said but what
[1:21:43] they missed what Moses said I'll send a
[1:21:46] prophet unto you like it unto me
[1:21:48] let's keep going verse 15. I Know Thy
[1:21:50] works that thou art neither cold nor hot
[1:21:51] I would that were cold or hot verse 16.
[1:21:54] so then because they were lukewarming
[1:21:56] either cold nor hot I will spew thee out
[1:21:59] of my mouth
[1:22:00] because thou says I am rich and
[1:22:02] increased with goods and have need of
[1:22:04] nothing notice how many Church fancy
[1:22:06] churches they have the stained glass
[1:22:07] windows all these things they have
[1:22:10] they're putting so much into the outside
[1:22:12] appearance but they're not putting
[1:22:14] what's into here
[1:22:16] God doesn't care how nice your church
[1:22:17] looks how many stained glass windows you
[1:22:19] can put how big a congregation is how
[1:22:22] many food suppers you do
[1:22:24] I'm not saying you can't do food suppers
[1:22:26] but those those things have its place
[1:22:27] charity all these things have to have
[1:22:29] their place
[1:22:30] but what God cares about is what is your
[1:22:33] your state are you hot or cold that's
[1:22:35] what God's caring about because that's
[1:22:37] why he's he's given a warning to these
[1:22:39] people in this age and warning to all of
[1:22:41] us because thou says I am rich and
[1:22:43] increased with goods and have need of
[1:22:45] nothing and notice not that thou are a
[1:22:47] wretched miserable poor blinded naked
[1:22:50] now if you saw someone running across
[1:22:53] the street naked
[1:22:55] you would think something's wrong with
[1:22:57] them you would want to help him even
[1:22:58] maybe but these Believers are
[1:23:00] spiritually naked they don't even know
[1:23:02] it they don't even have God they're not
[1:23:04] even born again and filled with the Holy
[1:23:05] Spirit but they think they are
[1:23:07] I rather
[1:23:08] I'd rather be filled with the Holy
[1:23:10] Spirit and not know it and striving to
[1:23:12] be filled with the Holy Spirit than to
[1:23:14] think I'm filled with the Holy Spirit
[1:23:15] and not fill the holy spirit that was a
[1:23:17] mouthful to say but I think you get what
[1:23:18] I'm saying
[1:23:19] so I'd rather be seeking for more Holy
[1:23:21] Ghost
[1:23:22] than to lean on the side of well I got
[1:23:25] it I'm good
[1:23:29] verse 18. he's given him an opera he's
[1:23:31] right now he's given his hand out to
[1:23:33] them to even to us I counsel you to buy
[1:23:35] of me gold tried in the fire
[1:23:38] that thou mayest be rich and white
[1:23:40] Remnant thou Mays be clothed and the
[1:23:43] shame of thy nakedness do not appear and
[1:23:44] anoint thy eyes with Isaac
[1:23:47] that thou mayest see as many as I love I
[1:23:49] rebuke and Chase and notice this be
[1:23:52] zealous therefore and repent
[1:23:55] repentance is such key it's a keystone
[1:23:58] it touches the heart of God
[1:24:01] because when we repent we're saying Lord
[1:24:03] I did this wrong and I'm turning away
[1:24:05] from what I've done I'm not going back
[1:24:07] to that wallow I was in I'm going right
[1:24:08] to you that's what true repentance is
[1:24:11] you can't just say Lord forgive me and
[1:24:12] go right back into doing it that's not
[1:24:14] repentance that's sinning willfully
[1:24:17] that's all that is
[1:24:19] so it says behold I stand at the door
[1:24:22] and not if any man hear my voice and
[1:24:24] open the door I will come into him and
[1:24:27] will sup with him and he with me so he's
[1:24:29] knocking at the door of your heart right
[1:24:30] now
[1:24:31] I hope you've let him in
[1:24:33] because he's a gentleman he's not going
[1:24:35] to blow it up with a grenade or C4 but
[1:24:37] he's gonna keep knocking till you open
[1:24:40] that door
[1:24:41] see a lot of times we want to be brought
[1:24:44] out of our situation where it might be
[1:24:46] in a low a low point in our life
[1:24:48] and we want to get all these things the
[1:24:50] counseling and to other people in these
[1:24:53] books but why not go to Jesus
[1:24:56] he'll take you out of any situation
[1:24:57] you're in yeah but you have to be
[1:24:59] willing to let them into your heart
[1:25:00] first
[1:25:03] a lot of times we think Jesus is some
[1:25:04] some dirty grandfather or some Santa
[1:25:07] Claus some Easter Bunny he's not any of
[1:25:09] those things he's not here just to run
[1:25:11] some errands for you
[1:25:13] he's here to change your life
[1:25:15] he's here to make you new to make you
[1:25:17] whole
[1:25:19] but you have to be willing to say Lord
[1:25:21] please make me whole whatever it takes
[1:25:24] I'm willing to do it
[1:25:27] to him that overcometh will I grant to
[1:25:29] sit with me in my throne even as I also
[1:25:31] overcame and sat down with my father in
[1:25:33] his throne
[1:25:34] he that hath an ear to hear Let Him hear
[1:25:37] what the spirit say unto the churches so
[1:25:39] we need ears
[1:25:40] our ears need to be circumcised we got
[1:25:42] to be able to hear what God is speaking
[1:25:44] to us individually
[1:25:46] but you don't expect the pastor
[1:25:48] to have all your Revelations when you
[1:25:50] ask them a question
[1:25:52] you got to seek it for yourself
[1:25:54] your pastor is put there for a specific
[1:25:56] reason
[1:25:57] not to not to be God for you but to lead
[1:26:01] you to God that's what he's there for so
[1:26:04] let's be your spiritual guide for a
[1:26:06] reason he's not here just to end
[1:26:07] servicing a little problem you have in
[1:26:09] your life that's what see God wants to
[1:26:12] be that that person he wants to be the
[1:26:14] problem solving in your life
[1:26:15] but you gotta let God let go and have
[1:26:17] his way inside of you you gotta be
[1:26:20] willing to say Lord how can I solve this
[1:26:22] problem the way you want me to solve it
[1:26:23] Lord give me the wisdom to handle the
[1:26:25] situation because the last time I tried
[1:26:27] in my way and it just I made more
[1:26:29] problems in this in my life
[1:26:32] see a lot of times we want to fix
[1:26:34] something but
[1:26:35] we put more problems in it that's not
[1:26:37] how God works when God fixes a problem
[1:26:39] it's fixed
[1:26:41] just like that
[1:26:43] so that's why he says my ways are not
[1:26:45] your ways and my thoughts are not your
[1:26:47] thoughts we need to start say Lord help
[1:26:50] me to think more like you help me to do
[1:26:53] like you do
[1:26:55] because your ways are your strength's
[1:26:56] perfect like that song we sung
[1:27:00] yeah like five minutes that's uh you go
[1:27:02] Genesis 3 6.
[1:27:05] time just flies huh
[1:27:13] so we know the three six so it says
[1:27:16] and when the woman saw the tree was good
[1:27:18] for food and it was pleasant to the eyes
[1:27:20] and a tree to be desired to make one
[1:27:23] wise she took of the fruit thereof and
[1:27:25] did eat and also gave unto her husband
[1:27:27] with her and he did eat so notice that
[1:27:31] she casts aside God's word
[1:27:34] looked at the tree listen to Satan and
[1:27:37] saw that it was good for food
[1:27:39] and it was pleasant to her eyes
[1:27:42] but imagine if she stuck with the word
[1:27:44] of God she would have cast these things
[1:27:45] out so anytime we get caught in a trap
[1:27:48] we do the same thing that she did we
[1:27:51] said oh this is good this feels good to
[1:27:53] me it's Pleasant to my eyes and look
[1:27:56] what happened to her they ate it and
[1:27:58] they had that's why death struck all of
[1:28:01] us that's all we have to die and get old
[1:28:02] because of that one decision so what
[1:28:04] makes think think that we if we make
[1:28:06] that same decision that we don't have to
[1:28:07] pay a price
[1:28:09] it's different now if you do it
[1:28:11] ignorantly don't know it but if you
[1:28:12] already know it
[1:28:13] and you're doing it then you have to pay
[1:28:15] a price
[1:28:17] I don't know what the price may be but
[1:28:18] you have to pay a price
[1:28:20] but why do we choose to pay a price we
[1:28:22] can go the opposite way and to stick to
[1:28:24] his word
[1:28:27] and go verse seven in the eyes of them
[1:28:29] both were open and they knew that they
[1:28:31] were naked they saw fig leaves Together
[1:28:33] made themselves apron like we said
[1:28:35] before Delilah was pleasant to his
[1:28:37] carnal eyes
[1:28:40] what thing in the world has been
[1:28:41] Pleasant to you
[1:28:43] what thing in the world has been taking
[1:28:45] away from your walk with Christ what's
[1:28:47] taking you away from living a fully
[1:28:49] surrendered life in Christ what's taking
[1:28:51] you away from from the Lord moving in
[1:28:55] your life the way he wants you to move I
[1:28:57] can't answer that question for you but
[1:28:58] you have to answer that self inside
[1:29:00] get we gotta get back in the prayer
[1:29:02] closet
[1:29:03] I believe five ten five to seven years
[1:29:06] ago we probably spent a lot more time in
[1:29:08] prayer and this age we're living in is
[1:29:10] wicked
[1:29:11] and we need more prayer
[1:29:14] is going to change the direction of your
[1:29:16] life more than any help book more than
[1:29:18] any you fill in the blame motivational
[1:29:21] video anything is going to change prayer
[1:29:24] now notice we said before it made Samson
[1:29:27] feel good it stimulated his flesh
[1:29:31] but but what it did was in return gave
[1:29:33] him blinded spiritual eyes
[1:29:36] every time you go to the flesh it's
[1:29:38] going to Blind your spiritual eyes every
[1:29:40] single time
[1:29:42] [Applause]
[1:29:45] now notice this before the children of
[1:29:47] Israel Their Eyes Were blinded
[1:29:49] because they chose not to go God's
[1:29:51] provided way they chose they want to use
[1:29:54] God as a dirty grandfather as Santa
[1:29:56] Claus instead of taking God out of his
[1:29:57] word
[1:29:58] let's be like Joshua and Caleb
[1:30:00] they were willing to go whatever God led
[1:30:03] him to they were willing to conquer
[1:30:04] whatever God told them they can conquer
[1:30:06] if God said you can overcome that
[1:30:08] Addiction in your life is God so you can
[1:30:10] overcome whatever in your life then you
[1:30:11] can overcome it
[1:30:13] because no no demon no devil can stand
[1:30:15] in the presence of God
[1:30:17] okay when Jesus went and Lead when in
[1:30:21] the presence of legion
[1:30:22] it bowed it says oh you come to torment
[1:30:25] me already
[1:30:26] so the same thing in our lives if we're
[1:30:28] connected in the right Source there's no
[1:30:30] demon no devil no addiction that can
[1:30:32] stay into your life
[1:30:35] that's right
[1:30:38] let me read a couple quotes you know and
[1:30:40] I got two more scriptures in our clothes
[1:30:41] I promise our eyes need to be open
[1:30:43] another reason our eyes should be open
[1:30:46] that is when we come into the house of
[1:30:48] the Lord we see his Spirit beginning to
[1:30:50] move and perform things just the way he
[1:30:52] said it would be done
[1:30:54] amen and we set with our eyes closed now
[1:30:57] I know that's true they set with their
[1:30:59] eyes closed and say well I don't know it
[1:31:00] it could be mental telepathy and it
[1:31:02] could be a fortune teller a lot of times
[1:31:04] we need to come with our eyes open bring
[1:31:06] God with you to church don't expect the
[1:31:09] preacher to bring God for you but you
[1:31:10] bring God to church
[1:31:12] you you prepare your heart and your
[1:31:14] prayer closet up until service so God
[1:31:17] can move in your life
[1:31:20] because God isn't going to move in your
[1:31:22] life if you're lazy
[1:31:23] he says not if I go to work and I say
[1:31:26] you know boss
[1:31:27] I'm only going to work for two hours and
[1:31:29] the rest of the time was gonna relax I'm
[1:31:31] not gonna get paid I'm gonna get fired
[1:31:34] so same thing in our walk with God God
[1:31:36] isn't God isn't going to just you know
[1:31:38] will you in the car all the way through
[1:31:40] he expects you to get up and run run
[1:31:42] this race he's called us to a race for a
[1:31:44] reason and this race is between you and
[1:31:46] your carnal flesh your biggest enemy is
[1:31:49] yourself you're the only person that's
[1:31:51] going to stop you from living a a
[1:31:55] a high life in Christ is yourself
[1:31:58] the way you think the way you act
[1:32:02] they're going to determine the
[1:32:04] destination you're going to go
[1:32:05] amen the kind of friends you're
[1:32:06] surrounded with you're the average of
[1:32:09] the five friends you spend the most time
[1:32:10] with
[1:32:11] I never forget that quote I read this a
[1:32:13] long time ago I read that some of this
[1:32:14] motivational speaker said that it's the
[1:32:16] truth because the people you hang around
[1:32:18] with you're gonna do you're gonna
[1:32:19] gravitate to their ideals
[1:32:22] their habits their ways that's why I
[1:32:25] surround myself with people who are I
[1:32:26] won't say better than me I I want to say
[1:32:28] it that way but people who Point me
[1:32:30] higher if I say it that way people who
[1:32:32] are going to point me to high directions
[1:32:33] high places they're going to help me
[1:32:35] grow and point me to growth
[1:32:38] because if I if you surround yourself
[1:32:39] with people who aren't going anywhere
[1:32:41] and eventually either you influence them
[1:32:43] they're going to influence you it's no
[1:32:45] Switzerland that's how it goes
[1:32:48] like we're walking together
[1:32:50] either we're going to match my Pace I'm
[1:32:52] gonna match your pace one or the other
[1:32:56] we need our spiritual eyes to be open if
[1:32:58] we want to be effective in God's kingdom
[1:33:00] we need our minds pure and unadulterated
[1:33:05] Samson could have avoided all the
[1:33:06] trouble we got into if he didn't let the
[1:33:09] enemy blind his spiritual eyes the enemy
[1:33:11] Works subtle
[1:33:13] he will put little things out of place
[1:33:15] in your life
[1:33:17] until you go further than you want to go
[1:33:19] if you give a man shall take a mile the
[1:33:21] enemy like I said before knows your
[1:33:23] weakness he's been studying mankind for
[1:33:25] so many years
[1:33:27] I came across this quote like a couple
[1:33:29] weeks ago says he be dares to put a
[1:33:32] picture of a complete new woman but he
[1:33:34] knows just how much clothes to take off
[1:33:36] with her to make her tempting sure he
[1:33:38] does so Satan knows exactly so he can't
[1:33:42] get you with an extreme
[1:33:43] but if he can get you just to kind of
[1:33:45] compromise this a little bit
[1:33:47] and he can get you he knows human nature
[1:33:50] he knows how to catch you in it too and
[1:33:53] he's awake day and night
[1:33:56] see Satan's Working Day and Night
[1:33:58] why do we take time off
[1:34:00] you know if Satan's working day and
[1:34:02] night to see try to deceive you then why
[1:34:04] are we taking time off then we wonder
[1:34:05] why we get deceived because we're taking
[1:34:07] time off isn't that serving God isn't
[1:34:10] punching in time clock and punching out
[1:34:12] it's not right in your dailies what
[1:34:14] you're doing from this time this time
[1:34:15] but it's a full of life a sold out Life
[1:34:18] Lock Stock and Barrel
[1:34:22] like a roaring line devouring that he
[1:34:24] will certainly he is so there he just
[1:34:26] knows how to do that
[1:34:28] let's go to first John
[1:34:32] like two more minutes maybe like three
[1:34:34] and I'm close
[1:34:36] [Applause]
[1:34:39] so first John chapter two
[1:34:45] and go verse 15 through 17. love not the
[1:34:48] world neither the things that are in the
[1:34:50] world
[1:34:51] If any man loved the world the love of
[1:34:53] the father is not in him verse 16 for
[1:34:56] all that is in the world the lust of the
[1:34:58] flesh the lust of the eyes and the pride
[1:35:01] of life is not in the father but isn't
[1:35:03] of the world so notice that these three
[1:35:06] things
[1:35:07] Satan will Target at you he can pick one
[1:35:09] of the three things the same thing with
[1:35:11] Jesus the same thing with Eve the lust
[1:35:13] of the flesh the lust of the eyes and
[1:35:16] the pride of life if he can get you with
[1:35:18] one of these three things he'll have you
[1:35:19] because it says is not of the father not
[1:35:23] one of those three things of the father
[1:35:24] but is of the world
[1:35:27] foreign so the thing is in order for you
[1:35:30] not to be deceived by that
[1:35:33] you have to be sober and be vigilant we
[1:35:35] said before you have to be you have to
[1:35:37] realize that your Devil is a cunning
[1:35:40] adversary that he's a good opponent
[1:35:42] and you have to make sure like for a
[1:35:44] boxing match
[1:35:46] if it's two boxers are facing in the one
[1:35:48] boxer says well I'm gonna train you know
[1:35:50] just the first week and I'm not gonna
[1:35:51] train anymore then chances are that
[1:35:54] boxer is going to lose the match so if
[1:35:56] you know it's a boxer they're both
[1:35:57] training constantly eating the right
[1:35:58] things working out getting the right
[1:36:00] trainer same thing in our walk we got to
[1:36:02] make sure we're training properly that
[1:36:03] we're eating our spiritual Wheaties that
[1:36:06] we're we're feeding on the right things
[1:36:07] that we're not watching
[1:36:09] all these things we shouldn't be
[1:36:11] watching because a lot of things we
[1:36:13] don't realize a lot of things radar
[1:36:14] movies and things like that there's
[1:36:15] Spirits behind them so music worldly
[1:36:18] Music Experience behind them and that
[1:36:20] Spirit can grab a hold of you and take
[1:36:22] you further than you wanted to go
[1:36:25] but in the Garden of Eden the devil
[1:36:27] chose the man's head God his heart and
[1:36:30] now the Devil comes into intellectuals
[1:36:32] and has brought his religion to
[1:36:34] intellectual you know never know God
[1:36:36] intellectually you've got to know him by
[1:36:39] a new birth being born again which comes
[1:36:43] from the heart
[1:36:44] the pride of life the lust of the flesh
[1:36:46] what the eyes can see but when God comes
[1:36:49] in he goes into a man's heart and makes
[1:36:52] him believe things by faith that his
[1:36:55] eyes cannot see
[1:36:57] the devil just switched it around and
[1:36:59] he's doing it to the Pentecostal Church
[1:37:02] praise God let's we can rise
[1:37:05] it's a closing statement
[1:37:08] our eyes in this age need to be open
[1:37:10] more than ever
[1:37:12] because Satan knows his time is short
[1:37:15] Satan knows
[1:37:18] he wants to get as many people he can on
[1:37:20] the board with him because he knows
[1:37:21] where his end is he may not know what
[1:37:23] the exact day is but if he can get you
[1:37:26] to compromise if he can get you to this
[1:37:30] not believe one word he has you right in
[1:37:32] his traps
[1:37:33] so let's not be like Samson
[1:37:36] did he
[1:37:37] go in the perfect will of God at the end
[1:37:39] yes he did
[1:37:40] but that's not the way that God intended
[1:37:42] for him to go out
[1:37:44] because he was humiliated and
[1:37:45] embarrassed all because he chose to go
[1:37:48] the lust of the flesh
[1:37:49] the lust of the flesh will destroy you
[1:37:52] every time it will make unnecessary
[1:37:54] scars in your life that you don't have
[1:37:56] to have
[1:37:57] see God doesn't want you to have
[1:37:58] unnecessary scars I got many scars in my
[1:38:01] life for not listening to the Lord
[1:38:03] but that was my choice
[1:38:05] and I don't want you guys to make the
[1:38:06] same choices that I made doesn't matter
[1:38:08] how old you are hung you are make that
[1:38:10] choice today make Christ accept him as
[1:38:12] your personal Savior and don't stop
[1:38:14] there we're making the Lord of your life
[1:38:15] he wants ownership and lordship of your
[1:38:18] life
[1:38:19] a lot of people to stop at savior but
[1:38:22] let's make him Lord of everything like
[1:38:23] that son says Jesus be Lord of all
[1:38:26] that's what he wants let's sing
