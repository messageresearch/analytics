true amen brother John would you like to come if you desire to know God more when he comes today and knocks on your heart and he asked you to do something that's him knock on the door wanting to come and have preeminence in something in our life that's where we're where the rubber meets the road as it were to where we want to know him more because it sometimes requires suffering but that's where you truly know him more amen so good to see brother Larry and says his wife Cheryl God bless you this morning so good to see you in the house of the Lord amen I'll tell you there's no place I'd rather be than with God's people where his word is being revealed yes because remember Jesus said I am I am the I am God and he's always a living God moving amen amen how many appreciate that message last night amen I I'll tell you [Applause] I'm it's still like bubbling in me it's still like I woke up with it I want to keep it going so I talked to her brother and asked if he would just stay here and not get off the Evangelistic field no I didn't say that to him but what a blessing that would be for us right but the bride needs what we had yesterday and tell him he's going to be praying for our brother amen and I'm just grateful that he was able to come by here and help us to encourage us to strengthen us and uh as the word is being preached this morning there's something in there that's going to help your soul we we want the blessings for the body that we want the blessings for the spirit but the thing that's Eternal is that which is for the soul and we've come for that we've come for that as well that's the most important so as the word is being preached to say Lord I need you to do something inside my soul that my character my nature would be more like you amen amen let's just sing only believe as our brother comes to give us the word of life we want him just to take his Liberty this morning and just preach everything that's on his heart amen [Music] only believe [Music] leave all things are possible only believe oh [Music] you believe all things [Music] all right all things are possible only only Jesus is here Jesus here all things are possible Jesus is here Jesus is here how many Galatians here today all things are possible Jesus is here amen if if he's here this morning then amen Joy is here and peace is here and love is here and amen everything that we have need of is here today amen if he is here and I believe with all our hearts this morning we do believe that he is here in the power of his resurrection amen and what his word said he would do he is doing and continuing to do and will do until all these things be fulfilled amen how many wants to be a believer in that word amen a True Believer in the word of Jesus Christ and we want to say God bless you all this morning and amen that sure is an honor to be a Christian and to be gathered together in the house of God and amen just woke up this morning to a little bit of snow on the outside and I know for a southern boy that's a little bit different amen amen God gives Grace amen but we sure sure appreciate brother John and appreciate the opportunity to come in the open door and the confidence to stand here and to speak to your people we say God bless you and your family this morning and amen just thank the Lord for the work of God here and I guess this is Fenton right Michigan so we're right below Flint right so amen we thank the Lord that there's a lighthouse for this word right here in this community amen and if you have your Bibles today while you're standing with us we want to look in the Book of John Saint John the first chapter in the book of Saint John the first chapter we want to look there in the 10th verse of John 1. I know it's a very very familiar reading this morning and just before we read the word can we just borrow hearts together and let's just ask him to come how many say Lord speak to me this morning amen Heavenly Father Lord as your Believers gather here on this Resurrection Sunday or as we're entering in a season of Easter Time Lord where people will become religious for a few days out of the year or they'll begin to try Lord some way to honor your Resurrection but Lord as Believers gathered here today we've not come Lord to honor a Creed or a tradition or Lord to be religious but father we have come here because there is a deep calling to the Deep and Lord your Prophet has told us that Lord if there's a deep calling to the Deep then there has to be a deep to respond Lord before there was a fan on the fish's back there was a water for that fish to swim in Father before there was a tree upon the Earth there was an Earth for that tree to grow out of Lord because before there is a creation there is a Creator and Lord before we your creation come into existence you the great Creator was there all the time lord we're inviting you to come in this building this morning may you may you take preeminence Among Us father may you drive out every Spirit that's unlike the Holy Spirit Lord may you bring every thought subject to the thoughts of God lord may you send healing into sick bodies here today Lord may you father give us strength dear God we need your strength we need your grace father we acknowledge our inabilities here this morning Father we acknowledge there's no way we as a man Lord could do anything father that would be of Eternal value to these people but Lord if we can get ourselves out of the way and we can let your spiritual divine presence come in this room then Lord you can do all things and Lord we ask you father forgive us of our failures Lord forgive us of our shortcomings change hearts and lives here this morning Lord we want to receive you into our lives in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ we pray and all the Believers says a man and amen The Book of John the first chapter in the 10th verse John here writing says he was in the world and the world was made by him and the world knew him not he came unto his own and his own received him not isn't that a sad verse he came into his own in his own received him not but as many as received him to them gave he power to become the sons of God even to them that believe on his name amen which were born not now notice this were not born of the blood nor of the will of the flesh nor of the will of man but of God and the Word was made flesh and dwelt among us and we beheld his glory the glory as of the only begotten of the father full of grace and truth amen we asked Lord this morning to add the blessing to the reading of his word as you can have your seats here this morning I want to by the help of the Lord I want to speak to you for a few moments on a thought I want to title it a heart to receive the Living God a heart to receive the Living God I was just reading the other day and the prophet of God says here and where is he King of the Jews he says now and I declare to you that the same Jesus who was born 1900 years ago lives today through the resurrection and is the same yesterday today and forever amen we then have just identified amen that God is the Lord Jesus Christ and he lives today through the resurrection amen so we can say it like this the Living God still lives right the Living God still lives I love how the prophet of God says it here again uh kadish bernia 56 he said how beautiful it is to find that the true and living God still lives today in the midst of all the chaos still God lives and Reigns amen God called man 58 he's in a prayer he says God May many of them be standing present now that will give all they got to the Lord Jesus and sell out to the world and go on to pass Guild the place of confession and Christian Beginnings go on to pass the school of the prophets that sit back there with their theology may they go on to Jordan to an open Vision where they can cross and find that the Living God still lives amen how many will agree with me that the Living God still lives in the midst of all the chaos in the midst of all the confusion in the midst of all the division and all the problems and situations in the world Amen the Living God still lives now I believe with all of my heart that there is no a living God except the Lord Jesus Christ amen and I believe that he is the same yesterday today and forever amen I believe he is the same lamb I believe he's the same healer I believe he's the same a savior delivered I love what the prophet said he said he's just as much the lamb today as he was then amen he's just as much here as he was there amen for he is the word and his word is the same amen then we're ever two or three are gathered in my name there am I in the midst of them that's exactly what he said amen he never changes he's God the word amen he's God the word then as Believers amen we are being born of the word now John said we're not being born of the blood or of the will or of the Flesh of man amen but we are born of the will of God now I love what first John 5 4 says just land a foundation it says whatsoever is born of God Amen overcome coming for world and this is the victory that overcometh the world even our faith amen who is he that overcometh the world but he that believeth Jesus is the son of God who is he that overcomes the world it's him who believes that Jesus is the son of God Amen and who is Jesus he is the word amen and what is the word it's the Living Word so whoever believes that Jesus is the son of God will overcome the world now amen we realize them that the word has become flesh right in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God and the Word was God Amen and the Word was made flesh and dwelt Among Us so the word amen takes flesh see there you are remember said God is going to have a church amen and that church is going to be born of the word of God Amen because it's the Living Word of God Amen then the church is not going to be a dead church amen it's not going to be a cold church it's not going to be a lifeless church amen but it's going to be a living church because it's been born amen of the Living God to thank today amen that we are living in a Dying World how many can agree with me we're living Amen in a Dying World Reverend said we're living in a Dying World amongst dying people but with a message of life amen we're living in a Dying World amongst dying people with a message of life and with an Evidence of the Resurrection amen now now when you start taking start taking about or talking rather about the resurrection you realize that before there could be a resurrection amen there had to be a death right Amen in order to have a death amen or a resurrection there had to be a death and we know that that the Lord Jesus amen was born of the Virgin Mary amen he lived a short 33 and a half year life he he suffered Beyond any human had ever suffered amen he went to a cross and died at death amen that no human has ever died before no no body has ever has ever withstood or had come under the things that he went through amen and then he made a promise before he went to the Cross amen that I will raise again right amen destroy this body but in three days I'll raise it up again amen now listen they had God on record testifying amen that you can destroy this body but I'll raise it again amen but when it comes time in the season of Resurrection amen the disciples become bewildered right remember the Bible says in Matthew 25 it said and the angel said unto women fear not ye for I know that you seek Jesus which was crucified he is not here right he is risen see come see the place where the Lord laid and go tell quickly and tell his disciples he is risen from the dead and behold he goeth before you into Galilee and there shall you see him amen lo I have told you and they departed quickly from the Sepulcher with fear and great joy and did run to bring his disciples word now brother remember said go tell who his bewildered disciples they had absolutely trusted amen that he was the Messiah and here he was dead and they didn't know what to do now amen but go tell the bewildered disciples but remember said in today amen the church is just just bewildered today as the disciples were then he said see they they they don't understand the scriptures they cannot understand Mark 16. they cannot understand these things he said see talk about bewildered amen they are more bewildered now amen than they were then because or something like they was they've been the only thing that those disciples had to comfort them was a past experience he said but see we have the message of the Living God that still lives today then we're not being comforted by a past experience of God Amen but we have the Living God in the midst of the Living Church amen by a living message confirming the signs amen and the wonders of his word let me say this we were not brought upon the Earth just to be church members we were not brought up on the earth just to be amen amen people that take up space on the Pew amen but we were brought upon this Earth to overcome the world Amen to overcome the devil come on it's in the Book of Revelation amen they overcome the devil they overcome the mark of the beast they overcome the number amen there's a bride upon the Earth who is not the overcome amen but she is the Overcomer amen by the word of God by the blood of the lamb and by the word of Our Testimony that if we're going to overcome we've got to have something to overcome by I propose to you this morning we overcome amen by the message of the hour we overcome by the message now when you start looking at overcoming it's very powerful to realize that there's a connection between overcoming and life there is a connection between overcoming in life in Revelation 2 7 he said he that hath an ear let him hear what the spirit saith unto the churches to him that overcometh will I give to eat of the tree of life which is in the midst of the paradise of God right there amen overcoming and eating of the Tree of Life in Revelation 2 11 he that hath an ear let him hear what the spirit is saith and to the churches amen he that overcometh shall not be heard of the second death so right there you've got overcoming shall not be heard of the second death now I love this and how can overcome but remember said I was crossing a log the other day and he said as I jumped on this log he said it looked like a real good log he said but on the outside he said it was a big old beach long and when I jumped on it a great chunk fell off he said it was rotten and Dodie he said and that's the way Christians are becoming see amen they've been dead in sin and trespasses so long till they become Doty they can't hold no weight they don't know what overcoming means he said here's what overcoming means overcome means keep life in you amen if you're going to overcome you've got to keep life in you he said when life went out that's what brought that log to that condition and it made it worse than it ever was when it laid in the branch where the water was and he said you take a Christian that's supposed to be a Christian and let the life of God go from him and the experience and the joy of serving Christ and the living in a church amen where such is going on he will rotten twice as quick right living right under so if we are trying to follow the message of the hour or at least this part of the message we should live constantly in the Life of Christ amen if we're going to overcome we've got to live constantly in the Life of Christ because if you don't you lay around and you know these things and you're supposed to do them and you don't do it amen the Bible said he that knoweth to do good and do if it not to him it's sin then you become Dodie and rotten when you're separated from the life of God God when a man is separated from the life of God he becomes rotten he becomes Dodie amen he says so strive with all that's in you Amen to stay in life amen The Life of Christ and then you'll be fruit Barren listen friends amen it's not easy to keep life in you it's not easy to keep life in the church it's not easy but if you're going to overcome amen you've got to strive amen and as you strive amen life is coming in and the only way you overcome death is my life the only way you overcome the world Amen is by the word of almighty god listen friends we're not here Amen to back up to the devil and lay down and let the devil take the life out of the church and take the joy out of the church and take the victory out of the church amen but I think it's a Cause worth fighting for I think it's a cause withdrawing your sword amen and doing whatever you got to do to keep life in the church now there's many gods but I say it like this again there's only one true and living God now amen I love what Jeremiah 10 10 says it says the Lord is the true God Amen he is the Living God an everlasting King and his wrath the Earth shall tremble and the nation shall not be able to abide his indignation in first Thessalonians 1 9 Paul says they themselves show us what manner of entering in we had unto you and how you turn to God from Idols to serve Amen to living and true God Amen remember should we are in His image we are living images of a living God that if we are living images of a living God Amen then we are dead to ourself and we are raised with him if we are living images of the Living God we are dead to ourself and we are raised to him his word is made flesh again in us he said what is the word or what is it not the mythical imaginary God sitting there amen but the Living God now what is the Living God Amen the Living God is the word in you making itself real now that's about that's a powerful quote right there the Living God is the word in you making itself real see oh my a living God made manifest in a living Temple amen and the word of God which is God is made flesh in you amen then the word is the Living God Amen the word is the Living Truth amen but that word has got to come into a living Temple and by coming into a living Temple that word will take preeminence in that Temple amen listen friends amen and when that word comes in it will equip you it will anoint you Amen to be more than a church member but to be a conqueror amen over all things you you will become triumph over all things amen by the things that are in Christ Jesus now amen we now have identified the Living God is the Lord Jesus Christ he is the Living Word he is the he is the Living Image now amen now we're going to turn a corner and say you are the living Temple that the Living God is coming into Paul says what know ye not that your body is the Temple of the Holy Ghost amen which is in you see which we have of God ye are not your own remember said so happy to know that we're living at the end days when we see these signs coming again like it was at that day of his approach and we humble our hearts in thy presence I I was hearing our brother's song service here amen it was almost preaching my sermon we humble our hearts and his presence amen old great Noble one let thy Spirit reign supremely in our heart in our lives and strengthen us amen From the Inside Out amen let the let the presence of the noble one the Lord Jesus Christ the Living God the Living Word come into a living Temple amen and release a strength that will strengthen us amen From the Inside Out amen every Divine promise of God in the Bible will produce it amen if it's met in the right kind of heart it will produce the promise now when you start looking at Hearts everybody hears got a heart right I know that probably be a crazy question to ask if you've got a heart amen but everybody here this morning has got a heart right amen now you realize that our heart amen can actually be found in the Book of Luke the second chapter and the seventh verse the Bible said that she wrote further Mary speaking of Mary she brought first forth her firstborn son and she wrapped him in swaddling clothes and she laid him in a Manger now if you begin to study that you will find amen that the manger is actually a type of the human heart amen that that Mary would bring forth her firstborn son and she would lay him in a Manger which a Manger was a stall amen or it was a crib remember said he is God and God is a spirit and he changed his cast so it ought to be striking to people to think amen that little Jehovah amen could have come a full grown man little Jehovah he could have come a full-grown man amen but he come into a Manger over a manure power little Jehovah crying like a baby playing like a boy Jehovah like a carpenter like a Workman Amen in the teenage hanging between the heavens and the Earth amen with gobs of drunken slobbers and split and spits of soldiers upon his face Jehovah dying for his children see it was not another person amen but it was God himself amen it was not another person it was God himself amen see because God was in his office he said why he was trying to get back to the heart of man amen then when Jehovah left that the the Splendor of Heaven he left the corridors of glory amen and laid aside his robe laid aside his Splendor and took on a robe of human flesh amen he was not doing that to make a name for himself he was not doing that to be something amen he was doing that because he had been kicked out amen of his residency which was the heart of humanity Amen in the beginning it was God in humans in the beginning it was God and Adam it was God in Eve but through the fall and the garden amen God lost his spot in the heart of humanity so he said what I'll do is I will come down amen and by my blood and by my sacrifice and by my death I will will take my position back in the heart of humanity what we need today is a fresh outpouring of the Holy Spirit upon the hearts that are humble amen he said if you could only realize amen that you're nothing but a stable if you can only realize that you are nothing but a stable now I got to thinking about this other day brother John and it kind of got overwhelming to me he meant to think that there was a stable amen that had now y'all ever been out in the barn it stinks right amen you got a bunch of cows and a bunch of horses and a bunch of animals amen it's a bunch of stance and all this amen but when when God came into that stable when God came into that stable amen it changed everything about that stable amen amen come on Amen when they went there they don't record the smell of the manure they don't record how dirty it was they don't report we the only way we know the condition of it is by our knowledge of what a what an environment like that would be right amen but when Jehovah came into that stable amen he changed that stable listen amen I turned this off amen Kings don't go to Stables amen Kings don't go amen and stinking places amen but there was something about the one that was in there amen that Drew three Mages across the Earth Amen to come into the presence of a stable amen if you can only realize that you're nothing but a stable amen God didn't go to Jerusalem he didn't go to Shiloh Ramos Gilead amen but he came to a stable that was polluted amen and when you let God Amen and realized in yourself that you're nothing but a stinking stable amen come up we might as well preach amen every person sitting here I don't care if you got a 401k or you got a negative bank account amen I don't care if you got a retirement home or you don't have anything amen I don't care who you are amen if you're the president if you're the mayor if you're the janitor amen or if you're the bomb underneath the bridge at the downtown Center amen you're nothing but a stinking stable I don't care if you're come on let's preach this morning amen I don't care for a patriot for a singer and for a deacon if for a Sunday school teacher whatever we are amen let's go ahead and say it we're nothing but a stinking stable amen the only thing that sets us apart amen from six billion people on the face of the Earth amen is God through his Sovereign Grace amen place the heart on the inside of us Amen to receive him in the age when he would be coming listen you're nothing but a stable we're nothing come on Amen we were nothing but polluted Stables amen we were polluted truckers we were polluted amen Street Walkers we were well brother Andrew I wasn't a polluted person I went to church you was a polluted church member amen but God who is rich in Mercy amen sin is Grace by his blood into your hearts Amen to change your heart you're nothing but a stable amen but oh if you can open the doors amen of the manger of your heart and let Jehovah come into that amen and watch what takes place amen for he is the word Lord then the manger of the Life of Christ today is the heart of the believer amen if you can let him come in amen he is the word and watch what will take place now when you start looking at this the heart must be prepared right I love how the prophet says this she said I'll tell you a little secret he said first thing friends is the preparation of the human heart amen see right in the human heart we were speaking of it last night right in the human heart is a little compartment in the middle of the human heart that doesn't even have a blood shell in it it's the occupation of the Soul amen it's the occupation of the Soul so man really thinks with his heart and not with his head amen a man really thinks with his heart and not his head amen then I love what Solomon says in proverbs 4 23 he says keep thy heart with all diligence amen keep thy heart amen for out of it are the issues of life that word keep means to guard it means to watch over it means to keep it means to preserve it means to guard from dangers it means to guard with Fidelity it means a Watchman amen amen so Solomon is admonishing the believer that whatever you do amen you keep my heart whatever you do you guard that heart now I'm going to preach to you here for a second amen because there's a war for your heart amen there's a war brother I'm sitting like this he said Christianity versus idolatry amen Christianity is after your heart and idolatry is after the heart amen because idolatry in Christianity Amen in order to have an influence must have a heart amen and Solomon said whatever you do you guard your heart you watch over your heart that's why you better watch what you're watching that's why you better guard your ears from what you're listening to that's why you better keep your eyes on your children amen away from the things of the world Amen because the eye is the gate to the soul amen whatever comes in the eye is going to the soul amen if you can see Jesus he's going to your soul if you can see his word amen his word is coming into your soul amen I say oh God turn our eyes from the things of this world turn our eyes from the things of laodicea and turn our eyes to the north star and let us pursue the things of God with a heart that has been guarded by the blood oh God Amen we ought to guard our hearts I said we ought to guard our hearts amen bitterness wants to get in our hearts we shouldn't let it get in there unforgiveness wants to get in our hearts we shouldn't let it get in there bad feelings wants to get in our hearts we shouldn't let him get in there listen that heart don't belong to bitterness that heart don't belong to unforgiveness that heart don't belong to the devil that heart belongs to Jesus Christ he does not need a stable a man full of bitterness he does not need a stable amen full of unforgiveness he needs a stable amen with a willing and ready heart to receive him in the age that you're living in listen you say well brother Andrew amen my heart's in a terrible condition I say thank God for the words of David when he said create in me a clean heart oh God and renew a right Spirit Within Me creating me a clean heart somebody say a clean heart creating me a clean heart oh God and renew a right Spirit within me the Waters of Separation amen that separate you from your iniquity amen and so for is the preaching of the word in the courts amen the Waters of Separation that will that will clean your heart is the preaching of the word the Waters of Separation amen that separates you from your iniquity and so forth is the preaching of the word in the courts he said do you see it the Waters of Separation was to be kept in a clean place he said then the church must be a clean place come on send the light church amen The Church Must Be a clean Place amen it must not be the habitation of every foulbird and all kinds of things going on in festants amen that's right a clean Place amen the word is to be kept in a clean place a clean heart a pure conscience that's to be given out to the here amen then I say this you need a clean heart you need a clean conscience and you need a clean Place amen for the word which is the cleaning power ain't meant to be kept into as the eagle stir Thrones in 1960 you may have the biggest churches there is in the country you may have more money than you've ever got that ain't got one thing to do with it you might associate with what you call a better intellectual crowd and you might wear a better suit of clothes but brother amen God wants a clean heart amen and Clean Hands he wants a cleaned up church he said then he can show himself listen you can have the best preacher the best intellectual speaker you can have the biggest bank accounts you can have the biggest church amen but if you don't have a clean heart with Clean Hands amen then God cannot find a channel they meant to show himself through but if there's a clean heart amen with Clean Hands you could be as broke as job's turkey I don't know if that's a saying up here but it is down south and then you can be as broke as I don't know what amen but if there's a clean heart with Clean Hands Amen in a heart to receive the Living God then he can come into that church and he can show himself alive he can show himself in the power of his resurrection listen I believe Church the word of God should be kept in a clean Place remember I said a dirty heart has no place for the word of God it should be kept in a true unadulterated heart that has been separated from the fangs of the world if you love the world or the thanks of the world Amen the love of God isn't even in you see the churches don't move the way they should because there's too much World in there they're trying to mix the Waters of Separation with it it must be a clean place to see the manifestations of the spirit in a clean heart amen The Church Must Be a clean place to see the manifestations of the spirit in a clean heart now people said to me before they've said well God said he gives the Holy Ghost but he never give it to me well God says he gives the promise to the father but he but I can't get it but do you realize the prophet said you've got to prove the promise of the Holy Ghost he said if you don't believe God will give you the Holy Ghost amen hear it recognize it and come up and see if he will or not he said now notice how he starts this you come with a clean heart you come with a sense their wheel and a surrender to him and you believe it with all your heart and find out what takes place yes sir he said there's not an intellectual conception of some mental something that you've had amen if God down in your hearts are calling you he will fill you with the Holy Ghost as certain as my name's built Branham he will sure do it if you will act upon what you hear and recognize it to be God if you will act up what you're hearing and recognize it to be God Amen then he said prove me come on it's in Malachi the third chapter when he said if you don't believe me prove me he said if you'll bring your store if you'll bring your offerings and tithes into my house amen he said then see if I won't open the windows of heaven and will pour you out a blessing now come on church I'm not here preaching for your money amen but offering and tires are still in the word somebody told me one time I said well I can't afford to pay my tiers I said you can't afford not to pay your tithes well come on church I mean you can't afford you say well brother Andrew amen 10 is a little too much gonna tell you how to fix that if ten percent tithing is too much going to tell you how to fix it start paying 20. in a few days ten percent will be just fine are you hearing me Amy people say well amen I can't do these things listen amen it's not amen it's not our suggestions it's God's requirement come on Friends amen and God is Not Looking for your money he's looking for your heart he's looking for somebody who will obey him by fulfilling the Commandments of this word listen you say brother I don't know if this will work well let me say this amen God just don't want the tithe of your income he wants the tithe of your time he wants more than just two Services a week he wants more than just a special meeting every now and again amen I think we ought to tie their time to God Amen he gives us 24 hours a day amen he gives us seven days a week I think we ought to give amen some time back to him we ought to give him some time in prayer we ought to give him some time and worship we ought to give him some time and meditation amen we ought to give ourselves unto God Amen and let the Living God come into a living Temple and manifest the living Reality by the baptism of the Holy Ghost my amen open up your heart and will welcome him remember said see amen recognize it to be God now in Luke the second chapter the seventh verse she brought first her fourth bro that's a tongue twister she brought forth her firstborn son amen and wrapped him in swatting clothes and laid him in a Manger see because there was no room for them in the End Amen now the reason he was in a polluted stable in a Manger was because there was no room for him in the end now look at this word in amen it means the lodging place it means an eating room or a dining room so there was no room for him in the End Amen so they brought him to a Manger in a stable deity of Jesus Christ 1949 no room for Jesus all for beer no room for Christ the cards instead of little book or something a Bible amen it's a little G-Man book or something like that no room for Jesus instead of going to church they go to shows and dances and everything and call themselves Christians but brother when the deity of God by the Holy Ghost comes into the human heart it calls out everything that Christ hasn't created when the deity of God by the Holy Ghost comes in the heart it calls out everything that Christ hasn't created you know that's the truth he said see let's invite him in and then worship him when he comes see we got to forget all the things of the world and remember whose presence we're in there was no room for him Amen to be born in the lodge in the End Amen so instead of there he had to go into a Manger into a stable into a polluted stall amen and be born in a Manger now you know amen today we're living in a time where there's no room for him Amen to come into denominations and produce a word birth in Revelation 17 verse 1 the Bible said There came one of the Seven Angels which had the seven vows and talked with me saying come hither and I will show Thee the Judgment of the great that setteth upon many Waters with whom the kings of the Earth have committed fornication and the inhabitants of the Earth have been made drunk with the wine of her fornication so he carried me away in the spirit Into the Wilderness and I saw a woman amen set up on a Scarlet colored Beast amen now watch these words full of names of blasphemy having seven heads and ten horns amen now the Bible says in the King James full of names of blasphemy that's the way the English give it but the original Greek from the die God reads it like this and he conducted me in the spirit into a desert and I saw a woman sitting up on a Scarlet colored Beast amen full of Blasphemous names now right there is where brother Brown gets the sermon titled blasphemius names amen that's a lot different from names of blasphemy Amen to Blasphemous names what is it now she was the mother of harlots now we all know that but what is it remember said see the Roman Catholic church amen but she is full of Blasphemous names now watch this the mother of harlots amen is the Roman Catholic church amen but the names of blasphemy they are full of Blasphemous names he said his Methodist and Baptist and Presbyterian and Luther he said all calling themselves Churches of God Amen Blasphemous names he said see they call themselves The Church of God and they're representing themselves before the world in card parties and drinking and carrying on and soup suppers and everything else and all kinds of stuff I come on Church you know I'm telling you the truth amen there's no room for Jesus but there's room for a Friday night bingo game there's no room for an old-fashioned prayer meeting but there's room for some movie Nights come on I'm preaching now amen there's no room for the manifestation of the resurrection of Jesus Christ but there's room for societies and room for women's knitting club and room for men's here come on church amen when did the house of God Amen become a social hall amen the house of God is a clean Place amen there shouldn't be filthy movies in the house of God there shouldn't be filthy jokes being told in the house of God I say oh God bring back the Waters of Separation into the church again and clean up the church from the pulpit to the back door well brother Andrew I don't think these things need to be said well there's only one church and you're not joined into it you're born into it and you don't come in there until you're washed in the blood of the lamb and sealed Away by the Holy Ghost the way into the church is not a card the way into the church is not a membership amen the way into the church is the blood of the Lamb amen and the watching of the Water by the word he said now they're holler at me about kicking against organizations it's those Blasphemous names amen that call themselves The Churches of God Amen Churches of Christ churches of methodists and churches its lodges not churches now we might as well preach since we're on this point amen and in the days when Jesus came the first time amen who received him amen the end didn't receive him because they didn't have no room for him and what is the end it's a launching Place amen there was no room for him in the lodge in place and in 1962 a prophet stood upon the Earth and said he's here amen is here again and he's wanting to birth amen people by the word amen and there's no room for him in the largest there's no room for him in denomination amen but thank God when there was no room for him in the lodge when there was no room for him in the Blasphemous names amen there was a bride who was upon the Earth who had a heart to receive the Living God I say oh open your doors Church unless the Living God come in and let the Living God birth himself out of you oh one church and that's the Church of the Lord Jesus Christ and what is it it's the mystical body of Jesus Christ in operation on Earth it's made up of a many member of any of those congregations that would be a member of Christ's body you have to be born into it not joined into it now you get mad at me if you want to but it's the truth anyhow amen make Proclaim unity and it's the biggest bunch of division you've ever seen in your life well it's the truth come on well is it the truth or what well well we're the we're the Church of God Amen well we got 17 different branches of one denomination well I'm here so I might as well preach that I remember one time I was in a barber shop and I sitting there brother kind of interested in me sitting there and a guy comes in and he was he was a preacher and I said I said well you know what what what denomination are you a preacher of he said well I'm I'm a AMA a Zion preacher I said oh really he said yeah I said I've got some I know some people who's in the ambience and he said yeah I said so let me ask you something I said what do you all believe he said well he gave me uh kind of a list of things they believed and I said oh you're interested and I said my great grandfather and great uncle and different people in my family were United Methodist preachers I said yeah I said so let me ask you this I said you all believe the same thing I said so why is there the United Methodist and then the AME Zion he said well the AME Zion is predominantly black he said the United Methodist predominantly white and I said oh I said okay I said well if you were going to convert me what would you tell me so he starts telling me all these things and I said well where would you tell me to go he said well I would tell you go the AME sign I said okay he said now I pray this is okay I said why would you tell me there he said well because of this and this and this I said well funny thing is the AME Zion United Memphis believe the same thing I said then why is there two separate churches he said well there you go sir he said once predominantly black and one's predominantly why I said so what you're telling me is what you believe ain't strong enough to bring two races together come on Church what you're telling me don't have enough power to bring come Amen to bring two races together to enjoy the blessings of God don't tell me that's the Church of God that's a spirit of division when I say thank God for a message where a black man can Shout with a white man where a white man can pray with a black man I'm on this message ain't a bunch of racial divisions it's the message of Jesus Christ and in him is no denomination in him is in no division in him is no separation he is God and he's the god of unity he's the god of power he's the god of reality he's the god of forgiveness he's the god of love I say oh that's the power of the Living God come in the church again and manifest itself in a living Temple we believe in stuff based on division we're one body we're one motive we're one objective I'm on Church well I pray I didn't stir up too much trouble but it's the truth what we believe has got the power to tear down racial barriers got the power to tear down listen amen I tell you this amen thank God for a message we're not judged based on our economic status you can be as poor as poor can be and still be a part of this church you can be as rich as Rich can be and still be a part because it's not a division it's a Unity by the Living God and the only way it can happen is by a changing of the heart now see God chose a humble manger then he's choosing a humble heart today the Bible says the Lord is nine of them that are of a broken heart and save as such amen that be of a contrite spirit see with the humble heart we embrace the word now I find it very powerful the prophet said we'd probably blow the whistles and Hoist the flags and lay out the red carpets and everything to receive the president of the nation to come to this city but just think that would be all right and it would be an honor to the city but think in our little humble Tabernacle tonight we are inviting the King of Kings God and he don't desire carpets to be thrown out and so forth he desires Humble Hearts to be laid out so that he might take these Humble Hearts and reveal to them the thing that God has in store for all those who love him come on church amen if a president comes we would say oh he's come defend man amen the president has come and it would be an honor to the city but what about right here this morning amen the Living God the god of gods the King of Kings amen has descended from his throne and Glory into the Church of the Living God I say he's not come here Amen to walk on red carpet he's not come here to be paraded around town Amen on the float amen he has come here amen looking for a humble heart it could be a five-year-old heart it could be a 50 year old heart it could be an 80 year old heart he just is looking for a heart that'll open up his doors and will receive him to come in in the power of who he is I'll tell you what Humble Hearts are they're Honest Hearts Humble Hearts are honest hearts and you know what the prophet said he said the Holy Spirit today is hunting out honest hearts that will believe the message what kind of people we should be amen humble-hearted people now on the day of Pentecost I found it very amazing that when Peter preached the inaugural sermon on the day of Pentecost amen the Bible said when they heard this amen they were pricked in their heart and said unto Peter and the rest of the Apostles men and Brethren what shall we do look at this word pricked it means to prick it means to pierce it means to pain the Mind sharply it means to agitate it vehemently it means to use the emotion of Sorrow amen then Peter said unto them repent and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of your sins and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost amen for the promises unto you and to your children and to all that are far off even as many as the Lord Our God shall call and with many words did he testify and exhort saying save yourselves from this untoward generation then they that gladly received his word were baptized then they that gladly received his word were baptized and the same day they were added unto them about three thousand Souls they've been watched before a receiving there was a repenting and where did it start it started in the heart of humanity I'm on church I love how the prophet tells us illustration or this testimony he said and he's in Jehovah Jireh 1962 Grass Valley California he says of all my travels through the U.S the United States and Canada I seen something last night that thrilled me than all the wheelchairs I've seen emptied up now when I hear that I'm going to keep reading amen I seen something last night that thrilled me then all the ill the wheelchairs I've seen emptied up then all the crutches I've seen laid down then all the blind to see the death to hear the dumbness speak the dead that's been raised up amen the doctor signed a statement that the person was dead and raised up and that's all been thrilling but when I seen people last night who were members of the church received truth and stand right up in the midst of the people Amen to confess the wrong and they're willing to do right that was the best I know of foreign more than all the deaf ears and stops more than all the blinded eyes opened more than all the crutches laid down was people when they heard the word they were willing to Humble themselves to the word they was hearing and repent of their wrongs and say Lord I Want to Be Right he said the church perhaps the bride is done chosen it's get her ready now amen the Revival is over we know that there's no more Revival spirit amen two hours of service and everybody is complaining Amen in a Revival it's day and night all the time never breaks he said the Revival is done so we are just gleaning amen remember Abraham send his servant Eliezer Amen to sweat it out until he found character and then when he found character the next thing was to prepare her then to meet the bridegroom that's the next thing you remember when he found her he found her in the evening time amen the evening light amen striking that women and men both last night seeing them in respect to the word amen stand up and admit they're wrong and coach God's forgiveness and to go on he said this is the place to have a Revival come on church this is the place to have a Revival if there'd be any Revival I know of it would happen right along here where Honest Hearts amen why because you got something to work on Amen if you listen if you only got two people in your church but you got two Honest Hearts you can turn two into twenty and twenty into 200 and 200 into 2 000. amen because it's not based upon quantity it's based upon the quality of the heart that is receiving the word that's being released in the age that it's coming listen I say oh God Amen Let Us skin our eyes off of numbers let's get our eyes off of Who's Who and who's not and who's weird who's doing what and let us get our eyes back on the promise that if two or three are gathered in my name I will come into their midst and I will baptize them with the Holy Ghost I will change them I will energize them I will stimulate faith in them to receive me and to man manifest me in the world and age we're living in when you got an honest heart you could have a Revival he said most of them will get arrogant they don't want nothing about it but see that type is a denominational seed it's not a seat of Abraham he said a Seed of Abraham sees the word and it believes the word quickly oh my a Seed of Abraham sees the word believes the word quickly now you all look here with me in the Book of Luke 5 chapter I want to just just take a few more thoughts here with you if that's okay and Luke said chapter the fourth verse the Bible here says and when much people were gathered together they were come to the out into every city and he spake him spake by a parable he says A sower went out to sow a seed and as he sowed some fell by the wayside and it was TRON down and the thousands of the air devoured it verse six some fell upon a rock and it soon was sprung up and then it withered away because it lacked moisture verse 7 and some fell among thorns and the Thorns sprang up with it and choked it but then other fell on good ground and sprang up and bear fruit a hundredfold and when he had said these things he cried he that hath ears to hear and let him hear isn't this astounding these are the same words he uses in the end of every dispensational Gentile age when he will say unto Ephesus under fatira understood he will always end it by saying he that hath an ear let him hear what the spirit is saying in other words the spirit is sowing the word seed of the age that the ears are hearing that word in and the disciples ask him saying what might this Parable be now what he done there was he shows you four different types of ground he said there's the Wayside there's the rock there's the Thorns then there's good ground and he's sending them verse 10 unto you it is given to know the mysteries of the kingdom of God but to others in Parables that see and they may not see and in hearing they may not understand verse 11 now the parable is this amen the seed is the word of God the parable is this the seed is the word of God now he goes in now he goes back to the different four types of ground and now he says in verse 12 by the way Saturday that here then cometh the devil and taketh away the word of their out of their hearts unless they should believe and be saved on The Rock are they which when they hear receive the word with joy but these have no roots which for a while believe but in the time of Temptation Fall Away amen verse 14 that which fell among the Thorns or they which when they have heard now notice this they're all hearing the word amen go forth in her choke with cares and with riches and pleasures of this life and bring no fruit to Perfection but verse 15 is the one I love amen but that on the good ground are they which in an honest and good heart amen having heard the word amen they keep it and bring forth fruit with patience now listen the prophet of God said predestinated plan is in plain view amen the word of God is a seed and must have the ground prepared beforehand so God in his Sovereign Grace amen prepares the heart first he prepared you before the foundation of the world to receive him in this age come on Church the devil didn't have a chance at you because before you come in the world you were coming as prepared ground to receive the Living God Amen he foreknew You by foreknowledge and ordained you to eternal life he knew you therefore he prepared you that's the reason you staggered out of these things and staggered into what you have now amen it was God leading you to the place where he had ordained for you to be if the ground isn't prepared beforehand it cannot grow now listen some of y'all heard the word five years ago you heard it 15 years ago you heard it 25 years ago 50 years ago amen and here you are today amen still believing the same word still holding on to the same word you know why because your heart was a humble but an honest heart that was prepared by a predestinated seed to receive the word of God and to manifest the word and to bring forth the word of fruit with patience unto God listen this gospel isn't worth only but it's through the power and the manifestation of the holy spirit it's the production of Mark 16. amen the signs and wonders shall follow them that believe he said see the word itself is dead until it becomes into an action and produces life and except according to wheat falling the ground and die it abides alone but when the word is brought I'm coming to a closure quickly when the word is brought into a heart of Faith amen that makes every promise in the Bible live again see it's got to live it's a germanized word and it must live if it's received in the right place come on church if you bring if you bring an orange citrus tree amen from the from the orange groves of Florida amen up here to the cold war north of Michigan amen that Florida amen trees not going to grow because it's not in the right ground it's not in the right conditions and if you put this message Amen in a Baptist Church it's not going to grow it's not going to grow in a Methodist Church it's not even growing a Pentecostal church amen you come on we might also going preach it won't even grow in a non-denominational church amen because there is denominational as the denominations are amen but if you put this word amen not in a building not in a church room but in the heart of a human with a heart of faith and the quickening Dynamics of Holy Spirit begins to fall upon that word it will begin to produce every Divine promise that's in God's word well it's the truth it must live if it's in the right place now when it's under the right conditions every seed will live again right but it's got to be put under the right condition now what you'll do then is you'll either receive or you will reject you will either receive the Living God or you will reject the Living God John 1 10 he was in the world the world was made by him and the world knew him not he came into his own in his own receipt him not I wish I was a preacher right now there are some powerful words laying right there he came into the world and the world knew him not and he was the maker of the world he was in and they didn't even know him but he came into his own and his own received him now look at this word received it means para lambeno it's a Greek word for for received it means to accept or to acknowledge one to be in such a secret professes to be not to reject a man not to withhold obedience remember so when Christ came on Earth it came to his own and his own received him not and those Jews were instructed by the scriptures of what kind of a character that the Messiah would be and the Messiah was to be a prophet according to their laws amen Moses said the Lord your God shall raise up a prophet like me and to him the people push our cling and if he won't hear him they'll be cut off from the people see the scripture never leaves any age without a clear-cut identification that we might know the hour we're living in listen friends he came to his own and his own had the scriptures they had the teachings they had the rabbis they had the Pharisees but what had happened was they had not recognized him into the word said he would be he was not coming according to their Customs therefore they could not receive him because he was not coming according to where they thought he would come but I find myself in verse 12 but as many as receive him Amen to them gave he power to become the sons of God even to them that believe on his name I think the last time I preached for you I spoke on the name of Jesus Christ that Sunday morning in them that believe on his name amen listen we have come back under the pure Revelation brother of the name of God we're not believing on some magic name we're not believe even on some wishing name we are believing only authoritative name of the Living God Jehovah amen come on church and that word received amen same word as John 1 10 it's the same word in John 1 12 spelled the same way but it's got a totally different meaning in John 1 10 received is paralambino Amen in John 1 12 received means lambeno which means to take with the hand it means to lay hold of any person or thing in order to use it in John 1 10 they profess you or him they profess this is the one that is to come but they never reached out and received him by claiming him as their own personal property amen but unto them who will break out of the denominational Traditions unto them that'll break out of the Blasphemous names and will take their hand and will lay it on the revelation of the word in the age they're living in they will pull him into their souls and as many as received him come to them gave me power to become the sons of God listen I think you may think I'm crazy amen but I feel the power of the resurrected Lord and is flowing through my body this morning I have received him I have seen him I have believed on him Hallelujah if you can receive him you'll lay hold on him you will claim him I love this one it means to take what is one's own they took him as their own he's not just the Messiah he's not just the god of the Jew he's my God oh I wish I was out in the field right now I'd cut up dissociate with oneself as a companion it means to receive what is offered not to refuse or to reject it means to receive a person and to give him access to oneself when you receive him you're given access to him you all got the tapes door to the heart door in a door over and over and over what's he saying he's saying you're a human you've got a heart but there's many doors in that heart but if you'll let him come in he said someone let him come in but they'll say don't go in that door don't go in that room stay out of my pride come on now stay out of the Door of Faith stay out of the door of my side amen he said but if you'll let him come in he said and give him access to every door he wants to go he said and he goes in there come on church he said if he goes in the door of Faith he said you'll say well you can't come in here Lord amen because that's against my faith he said but if you let him come in he said as soon as he steps in the door of Faith he will scream out I'm Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever and he said you will move from Human faith into the faith of Jesus Christ to perform the will of Jesus Christ now I'll just tell you this in case you ever need it amen sometimes people say well there's some trouble in the church I was reading one day I was actually I was on the phone with a brother and he was telling me about some situations and things he said Andrew he said help me pray with it he said I got some problems in the church he said I don't know what to do he said I don't know how to fix it that's what brother I'll be praying with you as a pastor and that's just praying along there and I was listening to a tape and Reverend said here's the problem he said when trouble comes in the church he said the reason there's trouble is because you won't let God Access the doors he wants to go into oh you all know that's the truth people will say Lord don't go in there Lord stay out of there Lord you're welcome here but stay out here but he wants to gain access to every door in the heart of the believer I say Lord I don't just want to acknowledge you and profess you I want to take my hand and lay hold of you I may say this morning Lord I want to lay hold of you I don't want to just pair a lambane on you I don't want to just receive you as a profession but I wanna I wanna take that other one I want to lay hold of you I want you to become my companion when he received them he said he breathed on him said receive the Holy Ghost that's the same word in John 1 12. he shall receive power same word in John 1 12. he said see receive him the holy spirit is making it live manifesting it if he promised these Blessings by the word somebody say with me he's sending the word he's sending the word not me he he's sending the word and producing what he said is the gospel set you like this in closing there is ascending station and there is a receiving station the father God said ascending station that's heaven we got a receiving station that's your heart keep by heart created me a clean heart your heart is the receiving station to the to the sending station and when really in your heart you accept the word of God he said it becomes positive no matter what the rest of them is seeing you're seeing it anyhow Abraham believed God and it was imputed into him for righteousness see we got ascending station and a receiving station just tune all the static unbelief out and watch what takes place he said watch the picture clear up then you say oh yes Lord I see now see it makes the difference it depends on how much static you let get in don't let any static in just stay right with God right with the word and God will bring it right straight through to the positive every time somebody say sending station receiving station the sending station is heaven the receiving station is your heart now listen that's two different dimensions right that's two different dimensions remember the father God says like listen said I was out in Canada the other day holding a meeting he said I was walking downtown and he said I passed by a guy he was selling television sets he said I walked by him guy said how you doing he said we're doing pretty good he said what are you in town for he said I can tell you you're not from here he said well I'm here he said I'm here for some gospel meetings he said oh he said you must be with that random outfit there remember said yeah he said yeah I am he said okay he said yeah he said I heard last night or the other night there was a man got up out of wheelchair and walked he said then I heard there was somebody threw their crutches down he said then I heard he said I don't go for all that stuff but he said oh you don't he said no he said I don't go for all that stuff he said why don't you go for all that he said well because you can't see what's being done he said you can't see where it's coming from remember I said oh really he said now I knew that old saying you give enough cow enough rope you'll it'll hang itself right he said so I stood there and kept talking to him and he said after a few minutes I looked at him I said sir God nice television set here don't you he said yeah he said well you want to buy one remember said no we don't have one in our homes whole different sermon he said no we don't have one at home he said but I would like to ask you something he said that picture on that television he said where's that coming from he said well that's coming from a guy over in the states right now playing a guitar he said well here we are in Canada he said and that guy's not in Canada but it's on the television he said yeah he said there's a sending station and there's a receiving station remember I said oh yeah he said see see anything scientifically that's proven he said I don't want to be a part of it's what the salesman said he said there's nothing to it it's only the things that's not scientifically proven as real is what remember I'm saying and the guy said oh that's ridiculous he said well for instance right now he said coming through the room is television pictures and I said you have to show me the picture he said of course he said here it is it hits the crystal the tubes and so forth and it shows the picture here I said but that man's in the United States and you're picking him up over here and he's coming to the air and you can't see him he said but we can prove it because there's a picture showing that it's over there he said then there's ascending station to prove that it's here the sending station is proven through the receiving station what's at the sending station come on church at the sending station there was a man playing a guitar at the receiving station brother there was a man on a picture amen playing a guitar that was witnessing what you're seeing in the receiving station is real at the sending station in other words what's real in heaven is being manifested in your heart and what's being manifested in your heart is a testimony that it's real in heaven amen when he's sending from the ascendants they sin is manifested in the receiving station I said oh yes we can prove it too he said well there's ascending station in glory and he said we've got the Risen Savior who sends it forth amen and the Holy Ghost reveals it and makes it positive therefore we got a sending station and a receiving station and God in heaven somebody say God in heaven God in heaven who knows all things can so put a gift in his church that he can magnify it and reflect himself through it and say things which is absolutely impossible by scientists to prove seat we do not walk by things we do not see we walk by things we do not see we walk by the steps of faith what are you saying about Andrew I'm saying if God sends a message it's coming from ascending station there's a receiving station on the earth going to receive do you realize right now brother Mark that right now in this room there's there right now in this room there's waves going through this room do you realize right now 10 or 15 miles we'll sit this way on 23 right now there's people listening to their radios driving up and down the interstate they're listening to the radio do you realize right now what they're hearing is passing through here on the way to the radio what they're hearing right now is passing through this room on their way to the radio but it's not affecting you you was under you you was unaware of it until I pointed it out to you now some of y'all cry now some of y'all gonna think I'm crazy but I'm not okay amen amen radio wage signals they've been going through the room right now you were not thinking about that until I brought it to your attention do you know why amen because there's nothing in you to pick up what's coming through here but there is something in that radio or it's wired in a way to receive the signal and when the signal hits the the crystal it will begin to display and manifest whether it's just picked up come on church amen right now somewhere there's somebody sitting in their homes when they should be in the house of God and they're watching television amen and you know what the signal that's going to the television is coming to this room right now but you don't feel it amen it ain't prickling on your skin it ain't tickling your eyes amen you know why amen because you're not ordained to pick it up amen but there's something else coming through here it's G Jesus Christ the son of God it's the power of the Holy Ghost it's the resurrection it's the life and the witness and the testimony of the one true Living God and when that begins to come to the room amen something in your heart begins to Paul say yes do you know what that is it's because you were ordained to pick up the signal that was being sent from the ascending station in glory Hallelujah there is descending station and there's a receiving station let our musicians come this morning there is ascending station and there is a receiving station remember said if God sends a message someone's going to receive it he said like this he said see when Jesus Christ spoke these words they never die science claims in 20 years from now they can pick up the literal voice they'll be able to pick up the literal voice of Jesus you know why because it's still in the Earth see it's ascending post then there has to be a receiving post I love brother John the worst he says and if you can be the receptacle foreign are you hearing me if you can be the receptacle the receiving post to receive the word of God then it's real to you and it'll live just like it was then how many can say Lord make me a receptacle to the Living God make me a receptacle to the message of the hour you know what a receptacle is if you look up the definition it's a brother a Seth's cousin a good buddy of mine brother Josh they're they're electricians if you get to looking at that if you get to looking at a receptacle you know what it's also called it's called an outlet so you say hey plug this in the receptacle somebody else say hey plug it in the outlet same thing so you see I I don't have one in front if there's one you probably sit up here right here there's a receptacle and there's an outlet right I'm not giving you electrical lesson right now okay hey not going there there's don't ask me to test it either that receptacle is built to house something that receptacle is is housing power do you realize you can have something amen but you got to plug it in so you you can have a vacuum you can have a you can have a phone charger you can have whatever amen but you need a receptacle so what happens is you plug that into the receptacle and then the receptacle is an outlet because when the receptacle has something plugged into it they're sipping in there that converts it and it goes from receiving to outputting it goes from receiving amen the cord to the vacuum cleaner and when the cord is plugged in there's a connection made and it sends a power out of the receptacle into the outlet and the vacuum begins to run come on Church don't you see what you are you are a receptacle and you are an outlet at Jesus Christ you have received the Holy Ghost you have received the new birth you have received the Living God you have received the message it has been plugged into your life and now by receiving it you become an outlet and you're letting your light shine wherever you go wherever you be whatever you do whatever you say whatever you speak you are manifesting you are an outlet you are a display of the power of the Living God once you stand to your feet with us this morning oh I say God make me a receptacle oh God make me a receptacle hallelujah hallelujah make me a receptacle you want a scriptural proof I'll give you one her name was Rahab Rahab was a receptacle for Jehovah come on church he was a receptacle there were two spies got in rahab's house and they give her a scarlet cord and they said Rahab just played this token the Bible says Rahab receiver everyone said like this she quickly received those Messengers she received those Messengers into her house and when she received him in her house she received what they had to say and the problem of God said is Joshua spies was leaving the land Rahab stopped them and said listen what do I have to do they said Rahab go to work paraphrasing they said go to work Rahab and everything that's underneath that token oh God everything that's underneath that token when the walls of Jericho fall whatever is underneath that token will be spared and the prophet of God said she went to work amen I tell you what we need to do we need to go to work we need to get our families under it we need to get our kids under it we need to get our spouses under we need to get everything we can underneath the token of the life of Jesus Christ in the hour that we're living in we need to get it under the Tolkien church we need to get it under the Tolkien friends she got everything she could underneath her I love how Birdman says this he said when she got everything underneath it she could he said in the walls begin to shake and the war broke out he said Rahab wasn't over looking out the windows when the war was going on he said she wasn't nervous he said she was in there reading the scriptures she was in there reading the scripture she wasn't worried because she had become a receptacle [Music] she had received it listen this morning friends I believe there's a possibility this morning I believe there's a possibility God right here this morning is calling some receptacles I believe he's calling some receptacles how many can say Lord I want to be that receptacle I want to be that receptacle I want to be that outlet I want to be that outlet I want to be that one this morning that the Living God can plug this living message into it and can manifest it out of my heart manifest out of my life how many can say Lord created me a clean heart would that be your desire this morning created me a clean heart or renew a right spirit Within Me amen you you know that song could you play that Force this morning amen I believe that's a possibility this morning I believe that's a possibility here today Hallelujah that's about our hearts together this morning renew my right Spirit Within Me Lord make me a receptacle Lord Make me a make me a [Music] chance I want to be that receiving station Heavenly Father Lord I'll cross this building this this morning as Believers Believers in your word Believers in the truth father we've not come here this morning to be church members we've not come here this morning Lord to be or just taking up space and fulfilling religious duties but oh God we have come here this morning Lord we want to be a receptacle to this message skeptical lord of the Living God we want to receive the Living God or just as that receptacle Lord receives the cord the plug-in father just as that receptacle receives it more than there's a conversion takes place inside that little outlet that space there's wires that connect and Lord I don't know all the all the ins and outs of it but Lord I know when you plug it in it puts power out Lord it surges power into the machine father there's a lost and dying world we're living in a Dying World amongst dying people and the prophet said with the message of life that Lord if we can receive this message of life it'll be a receptacle to this message will be an outlet to the power that lays within it father I pray your grace this morning with bless this assembly Lord I pray that you would make this assembly a lighthouse I pray you would make him a receptacle I pray you would make him an output I pray he would make him an outlet Lord or that the power on the inside of that receptacle that's received that word would be able to be pushed out and manifested and displayed to other Humanity Lord father we don't want a dirty Church we don't want to condemn conscience we want a clean heart a pure conscience we want a right spirit so Lord we're asking you this morning come in this room there be one here with a heart that's not clean as the Waters of Separation have been preached as the word has been sent out May the word just begin to claim

greatest message ever was the Messiah is now on Earth could only come from God who knows wisdom all the wisdom all the schooling everything was now listen this was now laid to waste and bypassed by the great wisdom of God he said I keep repeating that because I wanted to go down deep all laid the waste it was of no good bypassed it all to let God's wisdom have the right of way the god that takes nothing to make somethings bet you this morning amen amen I was in nothing but God took nothing and made something you say what did he make he made a son of God he made a believer he made an overcomer
