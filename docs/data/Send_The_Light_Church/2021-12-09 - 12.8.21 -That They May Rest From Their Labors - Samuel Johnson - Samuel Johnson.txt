presence well we're going to ask brother johnson if he would come forward at this time hopefully he can he can hear but we're really excited about uh having brother johnson with us today and i hope that you've all come emptied out so you can get filled up it's the only way that we can get more of god is to empty out more of ourselves in fact it's the only way that we can work for him is if we deny ourselves in the beginning of the day or else we can go through the day without them and we don't we don't want to do that we don't want just jesus on the wall we want to take jesus with us well we certainly appreciate our music ministry amen i appreciate our our our worship leaders and we appreciate the worshipers just so you know god is seeking such to worship him in spirit and in truth amen we don't want to let we don't want to give god less than what he's looking for i like what our brother mark said he said just give your all just give your all it doesn't matter how you feel give your all give all of your heart give all ye that have breath praise you the lord amen oh praise the lord we had a wonderful time in our men's meeting today we got some brothers that are marching forward as portable embassies and i'm giving god thanks for the work that he is presently doing amen he's a present working god amen you know this kind of reminds me when brother branham he would say you know what i'm waiting for at the end of the service he'd say you know what i'm waiting for when he's before he starts his prayer line he says i'm waiting on him while i'm waiting on brother johnson to get to get up here and we might have to praise the lord anybody got a one third a 60-second testimony yes i just want to say how thankful i am when i'm up here alone it gets nerve-racking and if i lose my form when everybody gets behind me and begins to just press through my mistakes it blesses me and i just want to say thank you praise the lord i didn't hear any mistakes i heard beautiful amen i thank god i was oh i we thank the lord amen amen the one thing is god does not want us to forget calvary what he done for us and i believe it's perfectly in order to con to remember what god did for us when he first saved us amen and all the things that he's done for us amen let's sing let's sing only believe only believe oh only believe oh only believe are possible only only believes [Music] all things are possible only believe lord i believe lord i believe all things are possible lord i believe lord i believe lord i believe all things are possible lord i believe amen you may be seated just a second brother johnson can you sit down just for a second sure brother johnson doesn't need an introduction and to some maybe don't know brother johnson but um um words i can't say the words i can't come up with the words that would properly introduce brother johnson to our church this is this man he didn't only uh he's a great preacher a great preacher he didn't only teach me that i need to cut my hair and that to wear pants and not shorts and to not swear he he taught me those things but what he taught me it was things that only his life could interpret so when he said we need to love one another it was his life that interpreted that to me amen i can't say enough about the life that he has lived i am proud of the life that he has lived he had i saw saul with my spirit my heart a love for souls like i've never seen another human being it was nonstop undying and somehow just about every one of us is attached to his crown somehow we're all connected because we're all the family of god and i'm sure of this when we get there there's going to be a bright light a bright light it's going to be bright it's going to be many souls attached to him johnson we're so proud of you and so grateful to the lord for your love for him and that you you heeded the call when he called you to come up to ann arbor to help us amen amen amen may the lord bless you and give you the desire of your heart brother thank you for coming we just want to turn the service over to you thank you brother you can stay right there let's just look to the lord in the word of prayer amen heavenly father we're not worthy of the kind words that our brother has spoken we are grateful for the call that was so sure so certain took all doubts from my mind and i'm so glad i obeyed you lord you've been so merciful to us and you have given us souls for your kingdom and that's what counts and we thank you for men like brother martin who not only heard but took heed to the things which he heard and has been such an example to the flock and you've given him a faithful flock and we thank you for every one of them lord may your hand be upon them may the joy of the lord be their strength we pray and father i just need your help tonight i just want to say what you want me to say and i i i'm depending upon you with all my heart in the precious name of the lord jesus amen amen all right let's turn to the scriptures in the book of revelation if you'd like to turn there with me now 14th chapter i'd like to read a couple of verses there amen 14th chapter and i want to read verse 12 and verse 13. here is the patience of the saints here are they that keep the commandments of god and the faith of jesus and i heard a voice from heaven saying unto me right blessed are the dead which die in the lord from henceforth yea saith the spirit they may rest from their labors and their works do follow them thank you lord for your word bless your word to our hearts this evening amen i just want to say to all of you you've been such a blessing and we appreciate we appreciate the privilege to just be here among you amen we've always been welcomed here and we thank you for that with all of our hearts amen they may rest from their labors well you may be seated hallelujah you know uh you don't have to worry about whether the lord will take care of you or your labor for him amen just do what he calls you to do do it with all your heart do it patiently amen and any abuse that comes just counted a blessing because he just pours out that much more blessing upon you when you suffer for his namesake amen he's been so so very good to me so one of these days it's going to all be over hey man i don't know how much longer he hadn't told me that he's going to take me so if if he wants to let me live to be a hundred it's okay amen if he wants to take me before then it'll be okay too because we've got a place waiting he said i go and prepare a place for you if i go and prepare a place for you i will come again and receive you unto myself and where i am there you may be in the midst amen i i just i just want to take a scripture over in the book of psalms if you would like to turn with me it'll be fine but it's going to be psalms 41 and verse 1. this scripture just was given to me last week and i thought that'll be something i'll share with the folks here tonight he said blessed is he that considereth the poor the lord will deliver him in time of trouble and he's been faithful to that promise to me amen he's certainly been faithful and you know anytime we serve the people of god it's on the record as though we serve god himself amen no reward no reward will be lacking on that day when we meet him i just wish i could still give what i feel in my heart you know sometimes you think you just better sit down but then it's like fire shut up in your bones and you can't hold it you know i'm not ashamed of what he done for me and i want to thank him for his great salvation i gave my heart to the lord at a very young age and i've never regretted the time uh i just i just am so happy that when i called on him he heard me remember he made a promise that whoever would call upon him should be saved and he keeps his promises all of his promises he keeps them amen i want to read some other scriptures now in the ninth chapter of the book of matthew if you'd like to turn with me we'd like to read something from there tonight for the glory of the lord i'm going i'm going to start with verse 38 35 verse 35 and 9th chapter verse 35 amen he said and jesus went about all the cities and villages teaching in their synagogues and preaching the gospel of the kingdom and healing every sickness and every disease among the people what a faithful lord we have amen one man said lord if you will you can cleanse me of this leprosy and the answer came i will amen he didn't make it complicated i will and he cleansed the man of his leprosy he said when he saw the multitudes he was moved with compassion on them because they fainted and they were scattered abroad as sheep having no shepherd then saith him to his disciples the harvest truly is plenteous but the laborers are few pray therefore the lord of the harvest that he will send forth labors into his harvest and i think that should be a prayer and we pray a lot more than we do amen send forth labor us into the harvest amen it's ready and you know he can't come until we find the last predestinated seed isn't that right he cannot come he will not come until the last one has come in and so the hardest truly is plenteous um i was pastoring in california when i had a burden to help the brothers in honduras the missionary that we had had to send down there he had come back to visit the brothers in the states and visit some churches and he was killed in a car accident and it was such a loss to all of us we we loved this brother ernest mccarthy was his name and so anyway in my burden to do something for the people we we became aware of a little machine called portable preacher it was a it was made by some businessmen out in california and it had the ability of playing 78 rpm records of playing a large uh tapes two hour tapes you know the big reels with two hour tapes and uh so it was operated by flashlight batteries so because there where i was going to send it they had no electricity so i needed to send something that they could use immediately without waiting for maybe not knowing how long before the electric came thank the lord they have it now but anyway i boxed it up took it to the post office i wanted to insure it for 200 because that is what it had cost uh the church that was buying it and uh so they said we don't ensure thanks going to honduras central america and i said why they said well maybe the postman along the way decides he wants it and it never arrives at where it is supposed to go and i said i'm not going to send it but i had made a promise that was why the offering was taken was for this so i think it's always necessary that we keep our promise and the one way i could keep the promise was take it myself and that was how the lord got me the first time on the mission field and the blessings were so great the interests were so tremendous the results of that was you know we had brothers that were called to preach and went out to preach the message and uh according to brother lisandro one of the first missionaries we sent out there there were a hundred groups receiving the message amen and i believe most of them are still going by the grace of god amen they're still going on because one of the tests of the work of the lord is that the labor will remain that the work will go on amen we don't want to start in this give up but it's something only the lord can do we can preach the truth but only god can save the loss amen and that's the reason for the gospel for if this gospel is hid the bible said it's hid from them that are lost amen so that's so very true i want to go now to the 10th chapter of the book of matthew if you would uh i would like to read something there for the glory of the lord we're going to try to give some of the testimony the 10th chapter all right i want to read verse 40 verse 41 listen to what the scripture says he that receive if you receiveth me he that receiveth me receiveth him that sent me he that receiveth the prophet in the name of a prophet shall receive a prophet's reward and he that receiveth the righteous man in the name of a righteous man shall receive a righteous man's reward someone asked brother branham one time what was the prophet's reward he said to be a friend of the prophet amen i counted a great joy amen i'm so grateful that my my dad went to hear him uh in 1946 again in 1948 and both times when he came back he had a testimony that stirred my heart that thrilled my spirit and soul and i thought it sounds like that bible days are here again amen and once you met that prophet i'll tell you there was no one that could thrill the soul of a real believer like him amen he gave you such confidence and such hope in the one that calls you out of darkness into the marvelous light of his word uh just want to give you a little testimony of some things that happen different places i remember i remember one time i was praying in my office about whether the lord wanted me to go to the philippines and he spoke back to me and he said to me if you don't go soon your invitation is going to be cancelled that's all i needed amen i've been waiting two or three years just to hear from heaven because i don't want to go on my own inclination i want to i want to know that it's his time amen i i i've only go to one country and when i got there the lord told me this is not the time and that was the country of liberia i had a burden for the country i prayed for the country and uh but i didn't i i just couldn't get rid of the burden so i thought well i'll go and uh as soon as the plane landed the lord in his mercy and in his grace he said this is not the time i said lord i'm here he said this is not the hour but he said just continue the burden amen and so since then i've been privileged to go back about three times and every time we've seen souls come to the lord in prayer and there's quite a few churches now that are bearing the word of the lord and i'm so grateful to the lord for that amen he said he said i want to tell you about one country i went to because sometimes if you feel a burden and you don't know anybody in that country and you don't want to go unannounced and just you know you you'd like to write some letters so i called the voice of god and they give me a couple of addresses and so i wrote them immediately and told them that i'd be coming to their country and about what day i would be arriving in their particular country i was actually visiting about six different countries in africa at that particular trip and so i uh one of the countries was uh was uganda so i never got a reply but i'd already had my ticket to go there so i just continued the itinerary i had the names of the brothers that have been given to me so when i got to the to the city the first city to preach i asked the brother i wrote you about two months ago i never heard from you so i was just wondering if you got my letter he said no we didn't get your letter but we knew you were coming well how did you know i was coming there was a man that lives out of the city that had a vision and he said there's two men coming he said they've got a bible under their arm and the word of the lord said they'll be a blessing to the bride i said that's better than my letter amen amen so after i got finished there i went to the other city in fact in fact there was such an urge that i went down to the bus station i sent one monday one brother to the airport i sent another brother to the train station but the fastest way i could get there was the way i was going to go and so anyway uh we we got about halfway and the driver said we're not going any further today tomorrow we'll be going to the capitol well the capitol was off to the west but i was still going further north because i wrote them a letter and i'm just fulfilling my promise so uh when i got there i told the brother that was with me i said grab the first taxi but get the fare first if you don't get the prayer first sometime it's double and so get the prayer first so when he told me how much i said let's take it let's go so he took us out to the it was actually a bible college and the believer was one of the professors in the bible college and the pastor came out of the church when he saw us in her uh come come out of the car so he came out and i said brother i wrote you a letter about two months ago and he said i didn't get your letter but i knew you were coming how did you know i was coming and i said he said he said the lord gave me a dream amen that you were going to come and bring the word of the lord to us will you preach this morning amen so the door was open but one thing that happened on that trip on my way from kenya going to uganda uh there was a young man that was going to travel with history because he he knew the brothers in uganda so he was going to travel with me and so we got to a certain city called el dorette and the driver said uh the bus the bus will not be going on today but there'll be another bus to take you on to where you're going and uh thank the lord anyway while i'm standing there the lord had told me to put a track in my pocket that morning that's the only time in the whole trip that he had told me to do that so i was i just stuck it in there and forgot all about it but while we were waiting at the bus stop a man came up warning at the track saying may i have that i said sure if you promise to read it and share it with others he said i will yeah and uh so i gave it to him and somebody else happened to see it from a distance and here they come running what about me so i reached in my briefcase and i got about half of all the tracks i had left we had given we had given so many tapes and tracks out along the way but uh anyway anyway the crowd just started coming from every direction and i said only one to the family i don't have enough for every individual but i gave one to every family that was represented there and so uh anyway brother peche from canada he was with me traveling with me on that trip and i said to him i'm going to have a street meeting in this city before i leave kenya and so he said my they're hungry and i said yes you know i said they've been taught communism probably some were given plenty to read but we haven't given very much of the gospel that they could read and understand the way to be saved anyway we we told the pastor that night that we were going to be closing the meeting at least one day sooner and so he asked us why when we told him what city we were in and we had a desire to go back there and preach he said wonderful wonderful we used to have a church there but he went into false doctrine i said well that's where i'm going amen and so the lord opened the door i had a little pa system that run on of batteries that i could just turn it on and off and so uh i had the brother that one of the brothers that was at the meeting the night before from the same city and he lived just outside of the city so i had him to sing a song he sang a song and people began to gather i mean in five or ten minutes we had about 200 people gathered very close we didn't have no trouble reaching them because the loudspeaker had reached a half a mile and so when they some heard it inside the stores so they came and stood at the door they couldn't leave the store but they come to hear from at the door anyway the first meeting the results was we we baptized 42 people out of that crowd so after we baptized them i said hey when you go fishing you don't get them all just one one saying you gotta you gotta try again let's go back and have another meeting we're right back to the same spot started preaching but a little further deeper in the message another crowd gathered and out of that group there was 25 or 27 i can't remember exactly that said they wanted to be baptized also so you know the wonderful thing was that one of the ones that give their hearts to the lord in those meetings became the pastor of the church and the very next two years later when i went back to visit they had 500 believers attending that church so they were standing true to the word isn't god wonderful amen but on our way from one city to the other uh when the bus driver wasn't going any further i i was a little disappointed but anyway i had a brother with me uh that said don't worry there's a there's a church here in this city if we can find out where it is and uh so anyway i got off of the bus and there was a group of young people right in front of the bus begin to ask me questions you know where you're from what is your name uh where where are you going i said i'm going to heaven anybody want to go with me and this is what i'm said sir we don't know the way and there was a big big tree just in a park about 30 feet from where we were i said step over under the tree i'll tell you all about it we don't want to be in town five minutes here i am preaching and while i'm preaching two young men came up and asked by my god what's happening here so he said this man's from michigan in usa and he's preaching so he asked them where the pastor was that that was having services believing this message so ah he gave him the the sister that knew all about it said just call this number and she'll tell you because she's been reading some literature from the pastor and so uh praise the lord he he knows just what he's doing amen i'll tell you he's so faithful to us sometimes you know we we just have to we just have to go by faith amen just by simple faith uh leave the results up to him amen but god always has a purpose and so when he when he told me if i was going to go to the philippines i better go very soon i just want to tell you a little bit about what happened a missionary had invited me to go there and i prayed but i hadn't felt the urge but i had i had sent him the church age book and asked him to read it when he read that i said in the church of the seal book and asked him to read it and he wrote back after he read it he said i'm going to have to read it again he said some things i don't understand and anyway anyway uh he he did not accept the message he had a lot of truth and had a good life behind him but the thing is the lord opened two bible schools the first trip that i went and wide open for me to preach the message in them and so of course of course when the organizations heard what i was preaching they became upset and they began to work against you know but so anyway anyway they had been writing some reports evil reports and things and so uh the lord the lord spoke to the head of the school he called all the students that we preached to and took them into a room i went in with them he said now he said this man is preaching us the truth said if you don't want to follow it that's up to you but i've already signed my resignation to come out of the organization and those who want to come out with me just sign your name on the same sheet of paper amen and i forget exactly but i believe it was 48 people that signed up and the 48 now didn't all get the whole revelation but some of them stayed faithful stayed true preached the word with all their heart and gave themself and so i was able on the first trip to baptize about 25 people and then and then uh the second trip there was more and about oh five years later they had a convention in manila the voice of god invited all the believers and so we had cooperated with them and so they had 800 people that came to the convention that said they believed the message they were preaching the message now you know i didn't i didn't meet them all it's impossible the philippine islands has 38 islands that are populated amen and they're scattered over a 1500 mile radius so it's not easy to get to all of them but god has a way amen hallelujah pray the lord of the harvest that he'll send a harvest uh some of you might remember our testimony about two years after we went to honduras now the first trip that i took there uh there were seven preachers that had already received a call but this was the first time i had met any of them so instead of me picking out i asked those ministers to pick out one i said we cannot send everybody but we would like to send one full time into the field and uh so they chose brother lesandro hernandez he had already been out he had already had people baptized and uh just had a wonderful spirit and uh so anyway uh he came from one of his missionary trips that he had been in honduras preaching in different churches and uh when he got off of the bus there were people standing there waiting to receive him and greet him and notify him that his mother had passed away just a few hours before this and so he asked some of the brothers would they go down to his house to pray for his mother and so they prayed and brother lisandro he prayed like this lord i i don't want to bear my mother without at least a box and you know i spent all my money out preaching your word and i don't have money to build a wooden box to bury her in and but i remember your word said that you're the resurrection and the life and when he prayed that scripture and quoted that scripture amen she came back out of her death amen hallelujah and she said yes she had crossed over amen but she lived about 15 more years hallelujah after that they never buried a dead person until they had a prayer meeting first amen imagine if we do that more we'll see more results i i happen to be familiar with the last report i got there were eight people had been raised from the dead hallelujah amen god is faithful isn't it hallelujah we we we heard about a brother who lived in liberia his name was brother stephen and the brothers in nick in nigeria said be sure to visit him he lives a long ways from the capital and most of the churches are in the capital area and he said be sure said he's a faithful brother i have met him personally well good recommendation sure enough he was at the meeting and of course it didn't take long for him to invite me to his place so one of the brothers uh in there was only i think one pastor in the whole group that had a vehicle so he agreed to take me to brother steven's place and so we went there and began to preach amen he had actually been a refugee in the country of ghana and he uh he had heard the message while he was a refugee he believed the message they had given him books he had read the books he believed he believed the report amen so when finally the war was over that was that was why so many fled the country there was just war all over the country and many had fled the country but so when he got to go back to his country the first big city he stopped in he had his family with him but he said before i leave this city i'm going to preach and so he began to preach right on the streets and people began to gather and listen to it he had about 20 that was baptized very soon very quickly so then he couldn't leave the town he didn't want to leave behind so someway one of the city officials had told him a lot that he could build a temporary church but he said it'll have to be temporary because they're gonna they're gonna come through there and put a street in this area and uh but he he asked him not to tell nobody he told him it was okay well he had told him he might have two years but in reality he had about 10 years to preach in that place and he had a nice little congregation but after i had visited him the first time i heard that they were going to come through and bulldoze the the buildings that were there that they will worship again plus this house that he had built he had a family of five and uh so the lord put it on my heart to go back to his city and and so uh we didn't know how long uh they said it could be any day they would be bulldozing the place but uh the lord gave us time they had already bought two lots one for the pastor and the pastor had bought one and the church had bought one and so uh the one that the church had bought was bigger but it was not in uh quite a nicer location as the other so they traded lots and so the lord had blessed the people in ann arbor to bless me with missionary offerings and i was able to take and and i told him to start making the blocks amen so they started making blocks we we went down and all we had was a was a motorcycle to pull the iron to put in the foundation but we was able to pull it from the from the place to the place where was going to build the church and they poured the concrete foundations and and began to lay the blocks and the lord helped us until we were able to get the doors on the church and the windows amen the church is still going on amen so just pray there's another church in in liberia that we would like for you to pray for they have they've put the walls up but they've come to the roof and uh they've run out of money and of course they let me know that but i told them that we'll have to pray and let the lord supply the need and so we have been able to send some money to them but they need just the roof now primarily the roof would kind of finish it to where they could start worshiping in the building otherwise they have to rent a building until so be in prayer for that brother his name's brother william excuse me amen oh it's hard to tell the whole story the lord's been so faithful he's been so good we were having services in the philippines and it was in a university uh auditorium that we were able to rent to have the services and two or three of the pastors joined in with me and supplied the music for the services and so none of them had cars so we all had to catch the bus to go back in time so we stood out on the street waiting for the bus to come and uh so there were some people that come by and so forth but after they had passed us and going up about oh no more than a city block from where we were standing uh the driver of the taxi a jeepney i guess you'd call it uh they make them in the philippines and he happened to see some of the men had machetes and so he drove up about 50 yards and there were policemen there that stopped them so he stopped and and then uh the driver jumped out of the vehicle with the keys and and he said car nappers car nappers so the police come running and those people got out of that vehicle but we were coming actually they were one vehicle ahead of the one we got in you know they were intending to rob the people but god was merciful god was very good and very merciful amen he's always kind amen i i want you to know that when we're doing his service remember the bible said those that die without knowing the truth you know they have no chance they've got to hear the word and we have a responsibility to do all within our power to bring him to the knowledge of the truth because who's going to hear without a preacher and how they're going to preach except they be sent hallelujah one of the greatest blessings that we can have is to know that he has sent us hallelujah and then we can go in confidence amen we can go in confidence knowing that he's sinners hallelujah if god be for us who can be against us hallelujah but remember there will be persecutions there will be criticisms there will be some enemies of the true gospel amen but we need not to fear because greater is he that is within us and he that's in the world hallelujah he's the one that protects he's the one that guides one of the one of the meetings that we didn't get to advertise greatly we just put it over the radio for a short time it was going to be in a in a building that we were able to rent kind of on the spur of the moment then the only way we could advertise it was on the radio and uh so the people gathered there was quite a good number they gathered together we gave the invitation 14 people came forward to the altar and we just prayed for him one by one and i can say if i could understand what happened to them all 14 of them received the baptism of the holy ghost there were more people heard the message but these 14 believe the message amen they were new to the faith they was new to the word but the churches are still growing amen pray for brother larry heart he is beginning to go over every year and and spread the word and god has used him god excused him greatly in the past and he's really rededicated himself to the lord and so the lord has has given favor with the people and to hold him up because he still spread the word amen hallelujah we got to go into areas that we had never been before remember all we have to do is obey his word hallelujah the fields are white to harvest and the lord said pray he the lord of the harvest that he will send more into the harvest and that's one thing all of us can do we can all pray we can all ask god to speak to hearts because he has to stir their hearts to be willing to do whatever he calls them to do amen and then he'll make it clear that's the wonderful thing about the lord he makes it clear what he wants us to do it's such a joy to see souls come amen to know him in the power of his resurrection even in the fellowship of his suffering amen yes we were we were preaching with brother dan williams from arizona while he was pastoring actually in louisiana his he and his father went with us and so uh it had rained all day long and i remember praying asking god to stop the rain before the service started so people most of them did not have a vehicle they had to walk or if they had money they could ride a bus and so and so we should have prayed we should have prayed for the lord not only to stop the rain but to keep the rain stopped after we met we began to preach the word and it began to rain just not real hard a lot of them had umbrellas and those who had umbrellas put their umbrellas up and so when i came to preach i just prayed oh god of elijah you can send the rain but you also can stop the rain and these that have come to hear the word to be able to enjoy the word more if you will just in the rain and we just started preaching and no more than 10 minutes the rain stopped and another 10 minutes or 15 uh the umbrellas went back up but not from the rain the sun came out so bright hallelujah amen hallelujah so you know it was a blessing to them that night we did not call a prayer line for the sick but we called for sinners but after the service i had told of a dream that a brother in my church had had before i left and i had not i had not told it to but one other church and i've been to several churches already but anyway anyway this sister she she asked one of the deacons to come and ask me to come and pray for her and so i looked for my daughter since it was a sister but i couldn't see her she was kind of swallowed up in the crowd but i did see brother brother williams he's about six inches taller than me and so it was easy to find him so i said you better come and go with me brother there's someone calling for prayer amen and she was in such pain she was just rolling in pain and so we prayed and so i said sister in the name of the lord stand on your feet and she got up she said i tried to get up a little while ago and i couldn't get up but she was able to get up her pain was gone completely very bad and the next morning when we came to the service uh someone said you see the sister setting up in the choir yes said she's the one that was here last night and she was just beaming with joy unspeakable in a heart amen you knew that she had kept the victory and the lord had healed her completely amen he's so merciful hallelujah let's just look to the lord in a word of prayer tonight and and may the lord bless your church and may god bring souls in constantly and when they hear the word may the lord just let them understand the word because when you understand the word you will love the word amen you will love the word when you understand the word and it's so important to hear the gospel of jesus christ and open a heart to the word of the lord amen heavenly father we want to thank you for this church that you've given to these people heavenly father what a blessing that they've been able to move into their own building and we thank you for their faithfulness we thank you lord that they've loved the word they've stayed true to the word and there's others that are going to believe the word too and they're going to come and obey the gospel of jesus christ heavenly father thank you for your mercy thank you for your grace thank you for those that have already heard the word and received the word and now they're sharing the gospel with other people thank you father for all of these things bless the pastor bless all the flock heavenly father as

those who brought the message were true and thank you lord that you counted us worth it to hear it and thank you lord that when we heard it we didn't turn it away we didn't reject it but we believed it with all of our heart thank you for your faithfulness may your blessings be upon the people if there's any here tonight lord that wants you to come into their hearts may they just yield themselves to you now hallelujah and may they just be hungry for you now and thirsty for you and when they call upon you hear their cry lord come into their hearts reveal yourself to them lord in a very special way thank you for giving me the privilege lord to come and speak these few things to them and we just pray your hand would be upon them now and that we'll all be faithful unto the end hallelujah for he that endureth to the end the same shall be saved thank you for that promise and we turn the service back over to brother john god bless you brother amen thank you brother [Applause] brother johnson's got more stories testimonies more testimonies than we could hear in a month time coming every day and it will take eternity to share for us to know all those testimonies but i'm grateful that the holy ghost inside of a man can do the works of the holy ghost and it's yielding your vessel to god because jesus told us to pray because the laborers are few we know his will and he's doing a short work and i i want us to to be faithful to do what our brother said today and let's pray pray about it god god will do the rest if we do our part i believe we heard from god don't you we gotta we gotta get this message out amen we appreciate you brother johnson so very much coming and giving us the word hey man i don't know how many countries he's been to but he's been to very many he's talking about the philippines if i could just sister chichi had given us a request to be praying for the new pastor that they're going to be electing in brother rowell's church so if we could keep that need lifted up in prayer and if no matter if god says this is not the time our brother said continue the burden amen continue the burden it's okay to have a burden and it not be the time so i
