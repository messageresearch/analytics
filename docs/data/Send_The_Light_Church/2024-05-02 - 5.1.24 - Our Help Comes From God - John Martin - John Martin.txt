know there's that's the big question how much are you going to get back you know and I know as we all get older um we can see um the hand of God in our lives help right there amen so praise the Lord for that amen also our sister Linda has a request please pray for a friend of mine sister childhood I spoke with her on the phone she said she would coming to church after her and her grandson pink ey is cleaned up so let's just continue to pray for that um also I uh um met a man at the I doctor out of all places and a young man and told him about the message and uh let's just pray for him I forgot his name right now but the Lord knows it and uh if it's him his he he'll come amen um we don't know if we don't ask so uh we just have to do what we can you know and I just I was going to give a testimony in the men's meeting but kind of time ran out but I'll do it for everybody else is um I worked for I retired a couple years ago worked for Pratt Miller for 35 years and uh I believe it was there when I got saved so thankful for that and um but as you know you your Zeal increases for the Lord people see it and uh so as I was uh just being a witness for Christ um brother Paul he's no longer here but he was he was there we would pray my office every day at a break so really I worked there for 35 years never really had a quotequote break I was just praying so uh anyway uh so we're there um praying continuously for I don't about a year and a half I guess and there was a man there that was dealing with uh alcohol abuse and some other things and and one day he came up and just you know said you know asked him questions and you know I just directed them to the Lord and he uh well basically he gave his heart to the Lord in my office and uh some of my you might know him his name is Ryan and um so from that day forward well before that we were praying in my office so there was another one more joined in there was three then there was four then there was five then there was six and and this is every day right and we work 10 hours 12 hours a day so it it's you know break was nice to have but they were willing to give it up for Lord and uh we outgrew my office so we moved upstairs and then when we moved upstairs now we were in front of a lot lot lot other people so they seen it so then it grew from 6 to 12 and it stayed fluctuated through the years because different buildings and different things situations but anyway I went back to see him uh the other just the other day and I wanted to go early because they're still praying and I went over there and now there's you know there was probably eight of us out there praying and there was a whole bunch of new ones new guys out there amen so I guess the reason I'm saying this is God honors faithfulness so amen you know sometimes you might think it's all in vain but it's not excuse me so just keep being faithful keep on keeping on that's all I can say so let's just stand and and um let's just remember um all the missionaries through the world the special uh uh people that are coming the visitors are coming brother Boaz and brother Ward and um just all the needs there's uh many needs before us for cancer and for other needs so let's just remember them in our hearts and just lift them before the Lord and uh just uh a prayer for each one of us that the Lord would just reveal um himself to us us amen tonight

Faith tonight Lord and Lord just listen to your word Lord and just draw closer give us ears to hear and eyes to see Lord what the spirit says Lord Lord and as we leave here Lord may we just be bold

things are possible Lord I receive Lord I receive Lord I receive all things are possible Lord I receive amen just before we came here when we were in the room uh we were on our knees praying and just expressing to the Lord that if God if you do not come all of our studying would be in vain because we need the holy spirit for all this to work amen it can't be a dead letter it has to be the Living Word amongst us and it is by faith that we receive amen and so we have to believe it amen turn with me if you would in um the Bible to Psalms 121 as you're turning there we did get a chance to to talk talk to brother Danny Ratliff he sends his greetings we wanted to invite him to the service uh with brother Daryl uh we want to be praying for that uh May 11th if we could uh get the word out and get as many people as we can to come because uh I just believe it's a special opportunity and uh we want to provide that to other people amen and we there may be a lot of people people that turn you down but I'll say this you're in the will of God by asking amen and he did make mention that brother Walt had just a positive testimony that he's doing really really well compared to how he was doing he's getting uh he's getting more and more movement back um we did hear from Brother Boaz uh today that he's flying in this Saturday so if we could remember his trip in in prayer God give him good traveling mercies amen amen now as we uh we just want to enter into the spirit of this word amen as we begin reading here in Psalms 121 and we're going to read just the first two verses and have a word of prayer and have you be seated uh the psalm says I will lift up my eyes unto the hills from whence cometh my help my Help Cometh From The Lord which made heaven and Earth amen amen Heavenly Father we want to thank you for the word of God today and we want to thank you for your presence here today for you are the only one that can make this word live inside of us and father we're asking you today to come and anoint all of us here in this building Lord uh as we said earlier Lord unless you come and do that we're going to come up short of what you really intended this service to be so we pray father for your anointing on the ministry of the word God that you come and bless this vessel with your your anointing for we're Unworthy of your presence and I pray for the help of your people may you come and anoint your word to their hearts father I pray that your anointing would be upon the hearts of your people upon the ears of their heart to be able to receive uh Lord what you would have for them and I ask that you would strengthen each and every one of us when we leave here today that we might be strengthened in the Holy Spirit father Grant it Lord remove every other spirit that would keep this from happening Lord we ask that you would be with those that are not here today that would desire to be here for one reason or another we just ask that your spirit would go with them be with them and help them in this hour and bless them Father we commit the service to you Lord and uh your people into your hands in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ we pray amen amen God bless you you may be seated we want to en entitle this message our help comes from the Lord a very a simple uh message but I believe most necessary amen and we want for a subject to entitle this the believer's resource amen as we continue uh reading or read those two verses again I will lift up my eyes unto the hills from whence cometh my help my Help Cometh From The Lord which made Heaven and Earth so we know it's coming from a very strong Source the help is coming from someone who's able to create heaven and Earth he said he will not suffer thy foot to be moved he that keepeth thee will not Slumber behold he that keepeth Israel neither slumber nor sleep The Lord Is Thy keeper The Lord Is Thy shade upon thy right hand the sun shall not smite thee by day nor the Moon by Night the Lord shall preserve thee from all evil amen he shall preserve thy Soul the Lord shall preserve thy going out and like coming in from this time forth even and even forever more what a precious precious promise right there amen you know we go through a lot of stuff and because we live in the flesh and we're bombarded with so many problems here on the planet it's our natural tendency to be looking to the world to Natural Things to other people to see those problems resolved can you say Amen to that it's very difficult to live down here with all the problems and still keep God first keep God as the resource for all that we have need of Amen there's an astronomical amount of distractions that we face every day problems deadlines demands and all these things make it very difficult for us to keep our eyes upon the Lord amen where the source of all of our help should come from right when I think about David think about David's life for a little bit tonight all the wars that he had to fight he was being the chief commander the Strategic leader of all the fights and all the wars that he was in all the people he had to leave lead as a king all the problems he had to to to not just deal with but he had to resolve them amen because he was the the leader all think about all the trials and the tests that he went through yet David Held The Secret inside of his heart of to where to get his help from amen he didn't have anybody else to go to right it wasn't some religion some church some Works he didn't have a picture of Moses with the burning bush right he didn't have a plaque of the Ten Commandments he had to have God the realness of God in his life to meet the need because those things don't meet the needs amen David had a relationship with the actual creator of heavens and earth amen and he said My Help Cometh From The Lord which made Heaven and Earth right I believe if God could get every one of us to focus on where he wants us to focus with any problem that we would have I believe we would be finding favor with God and I believe that needs would be met in an astronomical way true there would be many testimonies amen but I'm going to be honest with you God does not want to share his glory with any person amen amen am it doesn't true he wants all the glory for meeting all of our needs and he he deserves all of our praise right amen now everyone in the world wants some kind of help all the nations of the world at one time or another want help from another Nation we see them in the news all the time going back and you know asking help in asking arms and uh doing uh uh Maneuvers uh working together so everybody wants help at one time or another the Democrats want help the Republicans want help special groups want help doctors nurses want help hospitals want help the police want help farmers want help we're hearing that colleges need help right now government wants help with inflation poor people want help everyone in the world wants some kind of help at one time or another and they're all looking to everything but God everyone wanting help is looking to everything but God Amen David learned at an early age to look to God and to rely on God for help and this is good for our our young people he had an experience one time with a bear right the bear was going after the sheep and his job was to watch the Sheep well I'm going to tell you David was no match for that bear am he was no match for that lion but he looked to the Lord for help in this situation amen he knew it was a reality that he wasn't going to be able to defeat this bear in this line just like when that ball was ready to rush brother brandom he knew that he did not have the ability in himself to beat that bow he went for his gun oh I I I left in the truck right when all the the swarm of bees came he wasn't uh bigger than all those bees so you see God has to be a real reality and I know that we're not living at that time but God is the same yesterday today and forever he can be in my life he can help me with my problems but I need to really truly Look to Him for help right and not just say that I'm doing it but I've really got to do it my heart amen David learned at an early age and he took his experience at an early age and he was maybe too young to go into the army but it was him that beat Goliath right and he couldn't do it with his ability but the same God that delivered him he said he testified of that bearing that L is the same one that will will defeat this this giant in his life amen and I I am sure that as David grew up he continued to grow in a and grew in his experiences that his battles became heavier became greater amen he was no longer facing one Goliath he began to face Goliath everywhere he was misunderstood some people hated him King Saul wanted to see David dead King David experienced trouble distress I'm talking about on a national level amen he was rejected forsaken he was spit upon not only by his own men but he was it was directed by God the Bible says think about it he suffered as a murderer as a thief as an adulterer he dealt with the Temptations of popularity and power and numbering the people he suffered loneliness anxiety and depression he had to learn to Humble himself and become broken and become contrite amen David we could say this this he been there done it he' been through it all right how could this man be a man that was after God's Own Heart he really wanted what God wanted David looked to God in his problems right right when it came time to repent the resource was God Amen when it when it came time to to uh to trust in God and and and fight through negativity and anxiety and depression and all those things he looked to God he trusted in God it was a reality amen it wasn't just something that he mentally thought about he made a decision in his heart I'm going to trust God in my situation and because the actual fact that he trusted that is what brought the Deliverance that's what made God a deliverer to him amen amen he said I will lift up my eyes unto the hills from Once cometh my help my Help Cometh From The Lord now we all know you know God is the answer to all of our problems he's the one that really helps us but how often we don't put God to the test you understand I'm sure we all say well I ask God to come I wish God would do this but I'm still dealing with this and I still got this problem I I still got this flat tire nobody has fixed it yet whatever the thing is right that is what happens when we trust God mentally we begin to get discouraged and that's when we begin to play Church all these things that I read and if you just read the book of Psalms you could see that David went through so many things true he was you you for for being a a king and chosen of God and and Anointed with that oil that man went through so much and was found so often alone without any support he didn't have a support group that's the truth it's not about how many problems we have it's about making God the resource of what our problems are amen we just can't you know only look to God for certain things amen that that makes people jealous I mean that makes God jealous I'm I'm sorry but just imagine if you're going to use somebody how does that make them feel use your husband use your wife use your children use your parents you don't get what you want you go somewhere else how does does that make them feel God is a jealous God and he wants you to go to him and only him yes God will use other people but you don't have to tell them right God orchestrates it David said in Psalms 46 verse1 God is our refuge and our strength a very present help in trouble that's right amen we either amen say Amen to the written word or we say Amen to the spirit of the word you understand I'm saying you believe it right here because the thing that we need to start exercising is trusting God faith is not built by a calendar look we we just turned into may this is our first day of May well we don't got more fate today in May than we did April just because it may happen we get like a new dose you know like uh you get your new check that month it isn't like that you have to actually work for faith our faith the devil deteriorates our faith brother Brandon makes statements if we we come up for prayer all the time it weakens our faith well there's things that weaken our faith there's things that strengthen our faith amen and you take little things and I'll tell you here's the biggest thing if we learn to be grateful for every single thing we have that in itself will build Faith Amen brother just being grateful for what you have and and God God just seems to come in when you're just thanking him in the morning for all the things that you have and all of a sudden you feel good you you feel like you can move forward and trust him more just because you started out being more thankful Paul said in Philippians 4:19 but my God shall supply all your need according to his riches and Glory by Christ Jesus what a promise that we have but do we have faith to believe it today that's right we got to step out by faith and believe it our God Will Supply all now that I've underlined in that my Bible for I don't know how long because I've needed that since I come to know the Lord right and before I before I knew the Lord I didn't know what to do except you know ask other people right right but then when I read this I'm thinking who am I to go looking to somebody else for help come on I'm not you have not CU you asked not and I'm okay with with you know brother Ben I need some help can you help me move these hay bales I'm okay with that I am not okay with every time there's a need let's look to a human being we need to start looking to God more I'd rather be guilty of looking to him only when I could have maybe asked a brother or a sister you understand what I'm saying because this is a real thing God wants us to have a relationship with him that the word becomes real to us a living word yes not something we can quote not something we we know up here but something that's real to us yes amen God wants that I think that's beautiful that God wants that kind of relationship with us amen amen that's a special type of relationship ship when David needed peace God was his resource of Peace not his mother not his father that's right not his best friend not even the general of his army that's right right his source of peace came from God Psalms 29:11 says the Lord will give strength unto his people the Lord will bless his people with peace so where is peace coming from God Amen that's it God and God Alone Psalms 122:7 says peace be within thy walls how many wants peace in their home peace be within thy walls and prosperity within thy palaces amen amen Psalms 119 165 great peace have they which love thy law and nothing shall F them you we've quoted these scriptures before I know that you you you know them but look why would we want to look at anything else but God who is the source of peace amen why would you want to go to Burger King and see if you could borrow $5,000 from Burger King when the bank is next door that's where you go right you go to the bank to borrow money you go to Burger King to get the burgers God is source of our peace period period period period I don't I I I it it doesn't matter the turmoil that's happening at at work at home in in the church or anywhere and by the grace of God all is well but understand peace comes from God we can't be looking to others to give us peace amen peace doesn't come from jumping from one frying pan to another either amen Jesus Christ is the Prince of Peace yes Isaiah 263 says Thou will keep him in perfect how many wants to be kept in peace I don't want to be there for a little bit I don't want to be there for a day I want to be kept there amen right I want to be stayed there at all times amen amen thou will keep him in perfect peace whose mind is stayed on thee because he trusteth in thee now in this age when knowledge has increased and and the devil has been let loose and we've got more distractions and problems than we've ever had on the planet I am a believer today that we can keep our mind stay on the Lord I believe that you can't say well I'm I'm busy I'm too busy to have peace no we're too distracted to have peace that's all we got to do is settle our minds on the lord well how do I I'm I'm it's time to eat my mind's on eating thank the Lord for the food I'm working I I I my mind's on working thank the Lord for a job keep your mind somehow stay on the Lord when no matter what you're doing amen we've got to remember our source amen for peace amen the peace of God is not the absence of fighting it's not the absence of losing a loved one or a close friend it's not the absence of our heart being troubled we want all those things but that's not what peace is that may be the peace that we get in this world you ever just wished I just wish there were some peace and quiet amen amen I I I'm at work and and and for three days I've been trying to steal away what wasn't really I was waiting all day Monday to find out what the Lord wanted and I got a a little but I had no time you know to spend and so I was constantly looking for time if I could just you know get an hour break here or hour break there and finally I just I I told my my son today I'm going to go in the other room and shut the door because there's just so much going on there's times that we just need peace and quiet amen well God can give you peace in the middle of the noisiest thing going on in the world Amen Jesus said in John 1427 peace I leave with you right my peace I give unto you not as the world giveth give I unto you let not your heart be troubled neither let Let It Be Afraid so in other words we play a part we have to say I am not going to let the devil bother me I am not going to let this situation bother me God has left us peace we've got to tap into it amen we got to be the one that I'm going to get on my knees until the presence of God comes amen we've got to be willing to pay that price amen peace is simply a fruit of God where God goes his peace goes right his Joy goes his love goes it is a fruit of God it it is God he's the source amen it's the believer's resource God is the believer's resource amen Paul's speaking in Philippians chapter 4 if you want to turn there said Paul said do not be anxious about anything but in everything by prayer and petitioning with praise with Thanksgiving let your requests be made known unto God he didn't tell us to go anywhere else he told us to go to God and the peace of God which passes all understanding shall keep your hearts and Minds through Jesus Christ there again Jesus not want he's a jealous God he doesn't want your mind and your heart to be kept through anything it has to be kept through Jesus Christ amen verse eight finally Brethren whatsoever things are true and honest just pure lovely and of a good report if there's any strength and if you can praise God about what you're thinking then think on these things but if it's zapping the strength out of you and making you feel weak you can't say praise God for this happening in my life don't think on it amen stop it at the door because it will steal your peace those things which you have both learned and received and heard and seen in me do them don't be a hearer of the word but do them and the God of Peace shall be with you Paul described the his source of of Peace where he got peace from and the believer believes that the believer believes that the believer doesn't say well that was for Paul but it didn't work for me that's right the believer doesn't look for a temporary source of peace you ever tried to do that a temporary Source just kind of get your mind away from it but it's still there it's still gnaws at you God gives us a peace it's a real peace yes sir I believe that the three Hebrew children had it I believe Daniel had it in the Lion's Den I really believe that their came a time in Jonah's prayer that peace came after he humbled himself and repented look to the Lord amen peace came without that I mean he didn't have peace at the beginning when the ship was a rocking you know he said look just to be honest with you I'm the trouble throw me overboard it ain't like he had peace about it he knew he was out of the will of God and and maybe he thought this was the end when he first got swallowed by the fish he said oh this is it maybe this is the end but when he was down there for a day or two well maybe the Lord is waiting for me to repent and he looked to the Lord and that's when God did what he was going to do set him free take a look at what Paul went through if we had you want to write it down 2 Corinthians chap 11 but I just want to describe we talked a little bit about David let's talk a little bit about Paul Paul was beaten with rods four times how many times were you ever beaten with a rod right I mean I was hit a couple of times right couple of times but I I would imagine his beating you know wasn't just okay we want to spank you I mean he got cloud it over yes you couldn't even measure how many stripes he bore in his body he said they were without measure he said of the Jews alone five times he received 39 stripes in one place he said I bear in my body the marks of the Lord Jesus Christ amen I believe that his body was scarred just for standing for Jesus not because he did anything wrong but because he stood for Jesus he went to prison more often than anyone else he knew he was stoned he got weak and he got feeble at times and I want you to put yourself in Paul's shoes right now he suffered shipwreck he suffered perils on the water with robbers in the city in the wilderness with heathens with countrymen even among false Brethren this was a time of suffering this wasn't like hey we had a vacation we had you know bad weather came for a couple days it was a time of suffering amen he suffered weariness painfulness hunger and thirst he was often fasting he was cold he even said that he was naked didn't have clothes to wear and beside those things that happened outside of the church he said the things that came upon me daily the care of all the churches he wrote 14 books of the New Testament he ministered and labored more than anyone he said he was a a a a missionary because of his ministry he had a bullseye on his back and everything that happened to him through the hands of people was really orchestrated by the devil devil was just mad that this man was serious about God that's right that really he put God first in his life look what happened to to to to job God accused uh Joel I'm sorry the devil accused God that the only reason that job was serving him because he had all this money because he had a hedge of protection around him right and that soon as you take away everything that he has his heart is going to turn from you but God knew that he had a perfect relationship with him perfect and he had to prove it and it didn't happen in two days he went through a lot a lot he lost loved ones he lost a lot but he remained with his relationship with God he kept still going to church brother Dennis he still he kept giving his offerings he steep he kept praising the Lord right am he kept his Integrity with God Amen he kept his relationship with God he didn't allow his problems to dictate to him he knew God was still God right Paul still knew that God was God David knew that God was God Amen sometimes we forget who God is or where he's at and we we we struggle with things in life and we're we're missing out in that Rel relationship with God that we could have how is God going to meet our needs if we're going to question him if we're going to doubt him you know that here's the biggest thing we've heard so many people say it's hard for me you know to really believe in a God because why would God allow this why would God allow the Holocaust why would God allow uh all those uh people to Die the the the the Indians and and we've heard so many why would God allow my my my loved one to die to go through that suffering to get in that that that automobile accident right and what they are they're just open doors for the devil to get in there and cause people to doubt God instead of saying I know in whom I believed I'm trusting that God is a good god that he don't do anything UNG good everything God does is good amen we may not see it what some people call uh terrible God uh the prophet calls the tender hand of Jehovah yes sir amen because God is a good God but the thing is the difference is the attitude amen where do we stand with that are we looking to God are we leaning to our own understanding amen second Timothy y 2:9 just thinking now of Paul what he went through 2 Timothy 2:9 says wherein I suffer trouble and he may he says as an evildoer I can see somebody who's doing Evil all these things happening to him even unto my bonds but the word of God is not bound he said therefore I Endure all things for the elect's sake yes amen he was willing to keep suffering day after day after day to keep living for God to keep preaching the truth because of one soul that might be saved that was a love that Paul had for God you know a lot of people aren't willing to go through anything wanting to quit Paul never quit he never gave up he never said this burden is too heavy because he would be calling God a liar that is right that's right because God wouldn't put anything on you that you couldn't bear but Paul could bear a lot amen sometimes people can't even bear making it to church faithfully and when they come they're not even paying attention come on it's the truth the something little comes along and they don't want to come to church because they got some sort of problem amen just take a look at what Paul went through he wasn't an angel from heaven he was a man like you and I yes sir amen he had to make a choice like you and I and he went through so much more than we ever went through yeah that's right true therefore I Endure all things for the elect sake that they may also obtain salvation which is in Christ Jesus which is in Christ Jesus with eternal glory amen 2 Timothy 1: 11 Paul's speaking here says where unto I am appointed a preacher an apostle and a teacher of the Gentiles now each one of those things covers a lot of responsibility and he says for the which cause of these responsibilities I have I also suffer these things nevertheless I am not ashamed amenallah for I know I know whom I have believed and am persuaded that he is able to keep that which I've have committed unto him against that day you I'm a I just feel that we need to know the Lord a little bit more and we're not going to know God by coming to church right we're going to know God by getting our heart into church like getting a heart where we need to get it when the word is being preached so we can receive the revelation of the word and not just the knowledge of the word but we need to walk away from this building more connected to God and it ain't on God don't put on God that's a very proud Spirit that's on us the resource that Paul had was Jesus Christ amen it didn't matter what the need was it didn't matter how diverse or how unique if it was a a one of a kind or if it was the devil buffeting over and over every day God was his source to meet that need that he had Paul had a total Reliance on God a total Reliance on God imagine getting to the place that you're so trusting God I think it's one of the most beautiful places to be with to be at on the planet you talk about taking a vacation you talk about a sunset you talk about the ocean waves running in you talk about wyomi I'll tell you the greatest place to be in is in the presence of God that's where I want to be where I could totally rely on him for every need Paul said I have learned to be content amen with whatever situation I'm in there with to be content he lived by believing and trusting in God for all his needs amen he didn't say it but when God actually put him to the test he stayed faithful to trusting God you know a lot of times we have this because we live in a world of just you know storefront you know we want to make sure we got the best fo forward when we're talking to somebody that we you know we just got to show that we are the very very best Christian and that's like all that matters and we go home and we act like any way we want to act right trust God when we should be right doubting him questioning him amen God is calling the bride God is calling us to step up and start relying on him with our heart with our heart amen Paul said in Galatians chapter 2:2 Christ liveth in me and the life which I now live in the flesh right I live by the faith of the Son of God he no longer is you know I got to find somebody else to help me with this situation he trusted in Goden I want that I want that for myself I want a greater faith in God let let the problems come yeah let them happen I I I I want to be able to if I can't trust him what does it matter anyways if the problems don't come because I'm still guilty you understand what I'm saying right that's right I'm not just trying to say oh yeah I trust God so much let all the problems go that is not what I'm saying what I'm saying is if I can't trust him no matter what then I need more of God that's what I'm saying Paul worked on his relationship every single day with God he kept so close to God that no matter what circumstance happened God was there to meet that need yes he didn't want he didn't run to Gia he didn't have a group of clergy lawyers or Scholars or counselors that he went to In fact when he met Jesus Christ after he met Jesus Christ he never even went up to Jerusalem to see the disciples right that's right and get some questions answered because he had this experience he had questions come on you're the disciples you got to help me with this what what you know I experienced this what do you see he didn't even do that you know what he did he went to the source Hallelujah he he went and spent time with Jesus Christ in prayer amen and it was through that prayer that Revelation came that he was able to see who God really was it wasn't hearing from some other man right amen I'll tell you no matter how much of God that we got in our heart I I feel that the real God that we serve is a God that wants us to know him more wants us to be able to depend on him more and and to be like David a man after God's heart where God I want you in the middle of everything in my life yeah not just in part of it but in everything he had a total Reliance on God learning to rely on God learning to trust God I'll say it will probably be the hardest thing that we'll ever learn in life because you heard the story uh about the man who could uh take a wheel barrel and and walk across Niger Falls he could just take that wheelbarrow and walk right across nagger Falls all in the crowd they were just cheering them yes you can do it you can do it and they believe that we believe you can do it and he says well you come and get in the wheelbarrow that's well we believe it without that a lot of us believe in God to a point Y true I believe the bride is the only group of people that is totally going to put their lives into his hands you remember God told Thomas Jesus told Thomas you're blessed that you believe right now it's true because you see right he say but you'll be more blessed more blessed are they which believe and have not seen so I think there's a greater blessing for all of us when we look to the Lord for what's cometh our help our help comes from the Lord and it's got to be so real that we can trust him God is looking for that do you believe that David said in Psalms 91 how many you like Psalms 91 that's such a favorite Psalm of many of us verse two says I will say of the Lord he is my refuge and my Fortress my God in him will I trust now if I could just you you know do the last five words because anybody can say I will say of the Lord he is my refuge he's my Fortress can we say that when we feel our back is against the wall yeah I want to be able to trust him and be seen in my life when things are against me at that stronger relationship verse three surely he shall deliver thee From The Snare of the Fowler and from the noisome pestilence that's like being delivered from from New York City verse five Thou shalt not be afraid for the terror by night nor the arrow that fth by you ever just get bombarded in your head all these thoughts coming verse n because thou has made the Lord which is my refuge even the most high thy habitation amen amen you got to settle it you got to settle it verse 10 then there shall no evil because notice that it wasn't a period That's the semicolon there shall no evil Beall thee because you've made the Lord your Refuge your habitation there shall no evil bether neither shall any plague come thy dwell now that's a promise for us verse 11 for he shall give his angels charge over you to keep you in all your ways what a promise they're here they encamp around about us they're in our homes amen praise God they're in our homes to protect us to keep us because the devil is is always sneaking trying to get in amen verse 14 because he has set his love upon me therefore will I deliver him so instead of just he will set his love upon me now that's really the key but if you trust him if you look to him for your help therefore will I deliver him I will set him high above his situation yes sir because there's a relationship ship there he know my name not not just uh the name of Jesus but what the name of Jesus really means amen he shall verse 15 he shall call upon me and I will answer him I will be with him in trouble and I will deliver him and I will even honor him wow amen all because he's making God the source of his help right yes and and and it uh you know what I'm talking about here when you read Psalms 91 we're not talking about making God some dob booy or some Santa Claus or so someone that just you know we call upon to meet our needs but a relationship it's got to be a real relationship we all have tests and trials can you say Amen we all have problems and difficulty uh we have circumstances that are beyond our our control right we all have uh need of answers and directions for our lives we all have or have had but probably have some sort of health issues that we'd like to see taken care of don't you say Amen to that amen this is what Peter said in 1 Peter chapter 5:9 knowing that the same afflictions that you have the same afflictions are accomplished in your brethren that are in the world you're not the only one going through what you're going through amen don't let the devil isolate you don't don't do that and if these same things are happening to somebody else they're overcoming that means I can overcome amen and and what what's going to what's going to make the difference believing that greater is he that's in us than he that's in the world that's what it's going to be am amen now those other people that have problems and had problems before us they went on to overcome obstacles and they used a resource of faith in God the same thing that we have we don't use something different we use the very same thing that everybody else did turn with me if you would to Hebrews chapter 11 and I I I see myself slowing down and me not getting through my notes you know what I mean that's that's not good I got to get through these Hebrews chapter 11 but if we could just show you the difficulties that other people had to overcome when we stare at our problems there don't seem to be quite as big just trying to increase faith in that Avenue Hebrews 11:32 and what shall I more say for the time it would literally fail me to tell you of Gideon of baric and of Samson and japheth of David also and Samuel and of the prophets who through faith they subdued kingdoms they wrought righteousness they obtained promises they stopped the mouths of lions they quenched the violence of fire they escaped the edge of the sword out of weakness they were made strong they waxed Valiant in fight uh they turn to flight the armies of the aliens women receed their dead raised to life again praise God and others were uh were tortured not accepting Deliverance that they might obtain a better resurrection and others had trial of cruel mockings scorings y moreover of bonds and imprisonments yeah now this isn't Paul's testimony this is everybody but Paul they were Stone and S A Stone and were sown aunder were tempted were slain with the sword they they wandered about in sheep skins and goat skins being destitute Afflicted tormented of whom the world wasn't even worthy to have oh my think about how we look in the sight of God we're precious in the sight of God Amen they wandered in deserts and in mountains and dens and caves of the earth and these all having obtained a good report through faith receive not the promise God have provided some better thing for us that they without us should not be made perfect wherefor verse 12 chapter 12 verse 1 wherefor seeing we also are compassed about with so great a cloud of witnesses in other words they've run the race they kept the faith amen they didn't back down they kept believing and they overcame and now they're looking at us they're looking over the ballast if I could say it like the banner today looking at us looking at our lives and I believe they're cheering us on come on come on brother Dennis you can make it come on brother come on sister Lori come on my precious brother Jonathan you can make it but we've got to trust in God for it it's the only way God won't let it happen any other way so now that we're come pass about so greater callor Witnesses let us lay aside every weight what's your weights that'd be a good sermon what's your weights what are your weights that's good we all got them whatever they are Saints lay them aside get serious and lay them aside lay them aside and the sin which does so easily beset us and let us run with patience the race that has set before us amen we're always in a hurry in this age aren't we got to get this done but this you know getting the character of Jesus Christ we need patience looking unto Jesus now the author and the finisher of our faith who for the joy that was set before me endured the cross despising the shame and is set down at the right hand of the Throne of God and God is wanting us to look to him right not just the one who saved us right but the one who's going to finish the race the one who's going to really bring us into the image of who he is he has an expected end for us but we have to keep laser focus on the Lord Jesus Christ laser focus on him and don't allow the devil to distract us with all the problems that is happening and when we have a problem we have to acknowledge we got the problem let's sincerely God if my doubts I don't want my doubts to ever stand in the way again I am sorry for not trusting you from this moment forward I will trust you I don't know how you're going to do it but I will trust you for it amen it's got to be that way Saints it's got to be that we've got to continue to fight the good fight of Faith we've got to meet with God we've got to connect with God no matter what the need is in her life amen David and Paul and all all these men and women that we they depended on God they made God their shelter with all the storms that they dealt with think about that yes they made God their comforter with the pain they experien they made God their Rock when they felt weary he was the shield he was the strength and can we come into the church because we need to hear more testimonies that God is my rock I made him my rock he he protected me I put my trust in him and he took me through this this trial am and you know what it's okay that he did it a year ago it's okay that he did it a month ago we serve a living God Amen he's a present helping we need we we ought to have testimonies every time we come to church there ought to be a testimony put in back there written out this happened to me God moved in my behalf and because that ought increase our faith God has not called us to be a dead believer yes right a living believer because he's a living God Amen he don't wants us he don't want us to depart from the the a living God and serve a dead God he wants us to keep on pressing in until it becomes so real that we got a testimony that we can share with somebody that God is making me and an overcomer in this life amen amen turn with well I'm just going to read them God is the source of our joy and I just got a few minutes so I need to I need if you want to write these down Psalm 1611 Isaiah 122 John 737 and Psalm 1611 says in thy presence is fullness of joy amen we all would desire more joy we would just just unquestionably but are we willing to labor to go to the source to get the joy right amen you know some and you know sometimes we don't want to do that so we you know we we turn to TV shows we turn to right that's right some sort of entertainment y uh sometimes we we we even turn to a vacation to get joy now we need vacation we do I haven't had one in a [Music] while but it's not our source of Joy amen a source of joy and we need Joy because the joy of the Lord is our strength amen all right Ephesians 6 Ephesians chapter 6 and I want to kind of to rest uh rest this service with these scriptures because I believe this is the the the believer's resource uh to for their life Ephesians chapter 6: 10 Paul speaking to the Ephesian Church finally my brethren be strong in the Lord in other words you got to trust in him amen right can't be weak be strong in the Lord and in the power of His might amen put on the whole armor of God that you may be able to stand against every thought tactic imagination whatever the devil throws at you through whatever person he throws it at you right because if you got the whole armor of God you can take it amen how do I know that because we got a Bible full of example if and God is just God is the devil is not stronger today than he was back 2000 years ago and God is Not weaker that's right we just got to put our trust on him and put the whole armor of God on Amen it takes time to put the armor on if we're going to do a skit you're going to be a soldier going to take time to put the armor on it it takes time to put on the armor of God you don't wake up with it no for we wrestle not against flesh and blood but against principalities against Powers against the rulers of Darkness of this world against spiritual wickedness in high places now you pick up the news and all you see is news fighting against flesh and blood Nation against Nation yeah right th this this support group The you know this life matters that life matters and we got to get rid of this and we're going to protest this and you know the fighting against flesh and blood Democrats against Republicans Republicans again all fighting against flesh and blood amen but we're told that we don't fight against flesh and blood M we know what's happening in the flesh we know there's a spiritual battle going on wherefore take unto you the whole armor of God speaking again that you may be able to withstand in the evil day and having done all to stand stand therefore unmovable having your Lo Girt about with truth amen praise the Lord yes don't let one ounce of shady stuff be around you just get it out I'm sorry I don't want it keep truth around you and having on the breastplate of righteousness in other words I am going to treat not only my brother and my sister and my family and and my neighbors and my co-workers but you know I'm actually going to treat my enemies good and your feet shod with the preparation of the gospel of peace in other words wherever you go wherever you go it's going to be peace I don't care what the turmoil is there's going to be peace amen because you have put it on yes that's right well the other person didn't I don't care that's right that's you can be talking to somebody who's not a peacemaker and you can still be a peacemaker it may take two to fight two to tangle I say God greater in you can stop it right you can give the soft answer are you with me you've got you've been equipped with the word to bring a situation where it needs to be brought in subjection to the Holy Ghost I believe that your feet sha with the preparation of the Gospel peace and above all taking the shield of faith and you know you might have to go like this a little bit because the devil wants to come at every angle and above all taking the shield of Faith where with you may be able to quench all the fiery darts of the wicked amen now at work sometimes we have to heat treat parts and some of the times when we heat treat apart we get it red hot I mean it baby is red red red red red it's like this red brother Ron knows about this and then you take it and you dip it in water and when you put something hot in water what do you hear just it just quenches it in other words when you pull it out it's not red anymore that's what real Faith does it stops the devil amen it's over it's it's no longer we're GNA you know play with this thing in our mind no we're not going to play with it in our mind that Shield of faith is I'm resisting the devil steadfast in the faith praise the Lord amen and take the helmet of salvation and the sword of the spirit which is the word of God praise the Lord take the word of God praying always with all prayer and supplication and make sure you do it in the spirit it don't work unless it's in the spirit and watching there unto with all perseverance and all supplications for everybody that's in the church and the other churches All Saints sometimes we got to look Beyond ourselves in prayer amen get a burden one for another let us start testifying that all of our help comes from the Lord let's stand together I will lift up my eyes unto the hills from whence cometh my help my Help Cometh From The Lord the one that made the Heaven and the Earth He's Able also to meet my needs amen

desire before him as we as we pray I believe that God sees your heart he'll answer your prayer and he the Bible says that he would do exceedingly above all that you would ask amen so let's just believe our heavenly father we are your believing children amen we have come to you at this time at the end of the ministry of the word that you've given us and Lord we unquestionably undoubtedly hear
