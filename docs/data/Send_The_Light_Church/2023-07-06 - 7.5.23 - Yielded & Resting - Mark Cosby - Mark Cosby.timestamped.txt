[1:16] [Music]
[1:19] for you
[1:22] how many that's the desire
[1:24] amen was Bauer heads in word of prayer
[1:27] before we begin
[1:29] oh gracious Heavenly Father
[1:32] we just love to be in your house Lord
[1:34] Jesus our hearts just yearn in thirst
[1:38] Lord just to be in Precious communion

[1:48] hearts like only you can Lord touch us
[1:51] only like you can Lord father we just
[1:54] need your quickening power just to
[1:56] transform this word to our hearts Lord
[1:58] help us to receive this word Lord of
[2:01] life as only you can give it to us Lord
[2:05] bless the sacrifices all we made today
[2:08] Lord Jesus and Lord we want to just be
[2:11] obedient unto you
[2:13] bless this day Lord bless this evening
[2:15] Lord and may you take full control of it
[2:18] Lord move me Plumb out the way Lord
[2:20] may you just have your way Jesus
[2:23] Christ's name we pray
[2:25] amen
[2:26] well I counted an honor a privilege to
[2:29] be with my brothers and sisters in
[2:30] Christ again
[2:32] I just kind of an honor privilege to be
[2:34] here and uh we'll just open up in a word
[2:36] in Isaiah 28 verse 12.
[2:41] amen agree anybody on live stream I
[2:44] agree to our pastor and his wife
[2:47] so Isaiah 28 and we'll start with verse
[2:50] 12 and go to 13.
[2:58] amen
[2:59] love to hear the Bible's turning
[3:03] amen well so reverse 12.
[3:06] to whom he said this is the rest
[3:09] wherewith he may cause the weary to rest
[3:13] and this is the refreshing yet they
[3:15] would not hear
[3:17] but the word of the Lord was upon them
[3:20] precept upon precept upon precept line
[3:23] upon line upon line here little and
[3:26] they're little that they might go and
[3:27] fall backward and be broken and snared
[3:30] and taken they'll go to verse 10. for
[3:32] precept must be upon precept upon
[3:35] precept line upon line upon line here
[3:38] little and they're little you may be
[3:40] seated so we look in verse 12 it's just
[3:43] talking about this rest that God has
[3:46] given us or he is to give us and we'll
[3:50] tie this little message yielded and
[3:53] resting
[3:54] and so the word yielded means to
[3:58] conceited allowed resigned and
[4:01] surrendered so when you're yielding
[4:03] you're you're giving up something you're
[4:04] giving up your life you're saying Lord
[4:06] here's my life and so we just see that
[4:09] in the plan of God in order for him to
[4:12] be manifested in our life for him to be
[4:15] powerful in our life we have to yield
[4:18] that's the only way that that power can
[4:20] be accessed if we're yielded to him
[4:23] right
[4:24] and we go to Matthew 11.
[4:27] Matthew 11 verses 28-30 very familiar
[4:31] scriptures we all heard them many times
[4:39] amen
[4:40] so Matthew 11 verses 28-30 so Jesus
[4:43] speaking here come unto me all ye that
[4:47] labor and are heavy laden and I will
[4:50] give you rest so Jesus is offering
[4:54] offering us a rest to all of us not just
[4:57] because your name in so and so but he's
[5:00] offering this rest to everyone
[5:03] and but the thing is this rest
[5:06] requires something it says take my yoke
[5:09] upon you and learn of me
[5:12] so you have to that yolk you have to
[5:15] submit and let that the Lord put that
[5:17] yoke on and you have to take that yoke
[5:18] and put it on you yourself
[5:20] for I am meek and lowly in heart and you
[5:22] should find rest unto your souls so
[5:25] notice it's not talking about some
[5:27] natural rest like a vacation but it's a
[5:30] rest of your soul
[5:31] when everything's going wrong that that
[5:33] your soul is going to be anchored in the
[5:35] Haven of Rest so that's the type of rest
[5:37] that we need to have vacations are good
[5:40] they're wonderful but they're temporal
[5:42] but this rest he's talking about is
[5:44] going to give you rest deep down in here
[5:46] that no other person can give you not
[5:48] your wife not your best friend not not
[5:50] not whoever but only this rest can come
[5:53] from Jesus verse 30 for my yoke is easy
[5:56] and my burden is light
[5:58] so uh it's this song you guys might have
[6:01] heard of it I'll just read the lyrics I
[6:03] I just love I love this song too as well
[6:05] says the more that I Surrender the
[6:08] lighter my load the more that I release
[6:10] my cares the more you take control it
[6:14] says the more that I can humble myself
[6:16] the more you lift me up and every day I
[6:19] live Lord I love you more
[6:21] and the problems I had one yesterday are
[6:24] my Stepping Stones to a higher place the
[6:27] trials that seemed so awesome to me are
[6:30] now patterns of Victory I know I'm
[6:32] headed to my future home and the voice I
[6:34] hear is yours alone every day that I
[6:37] live Lord I love you more and it gets
[6:40] easier to understand the road I'm
[6:42] traveling no more wavering or wandering
[6:44] I'm standing on Solid Ground And I know
[6:47] I'm headed to my future home and the
[6:49] voice I hear is years alone every day I
[6:52] live Lord I love you more so just to
[6:54] think about that that statement the more
[6:57] that you surrender the lighter becomes
[7:00] your load so it's this rest that Jesus
[7:03] is trying to give us see we try to Bear
[7:06] all these things ourself but God did not
[7:09] intend us to Bear all these things
[7:10] ourself he intended for us to ask for
[7:14] him for help for strength but we have to
[7:17] be willing to swallow our pride and re
[7:19] and and say that we don't have
[7:21] everything figured out because if we did
[7:23] we wouldn't be here
[7:25] we wouldn't need Faith but the reason
[7:27] why we're here today is because we know
[7:29] that the God we serve everything we have
[7:32] is because of him without him we have
[7:35] nothing so that's why we're here today
[7:36] by his grace
[7:38] out so we said Jesus is offering us or
[7:42] he's offering everybody this rest no
[7:44] matter if you're serving him or not
[7:45] there's so many people who are
[7:46] struggling uh in this world with
[7:49] addictions and all these other things
[7:50] and they're the very answer is right in
[7:53] front of them is Jesus Christ but
[7:55] they're not willing to submit to him to
[7:57] receive that rest so
[8:00] amen
[8:01] so let's go to Hebrews 4 very familiar
[8:03] scripture so this this rest that we're
[8:06] just going to talking about in Hebrews 4
[8:07] is a rest that will stand the test of
[8:10] time a rest that will carry you through
[8:13] a rest that requires a trust a rest that
[8:17] can detain obtained by all of us we just
[8:20] have to trust him with all our heart
[8:23] and we must notice that this rest is
[8:25] only available through submission that's
[8:28] the only way you can obtain this rest
[8:30] you can't read uh encyclopedias you
[8:33] can't can't do all these things to do it
[8:35] but it's something you have to submit
[8:36] into
[8:38] and so in verse 4
[8:40] or sorry verse one so let us therefore
[8:43] fear
[8:44] lest a promise being left us of entering
[8:49] into his rest
[8:50] any of you that seem to come short of it
[8:53] For unto us was the Gospel preached as
[8:56] well unto them but the word priest
[8:59] should not profit them not being mixed
[9:02] with faith in them that heard it so they
[9:04] heard the word of God
[9:06] but their faith couldn't grab a hold of
[9:08] it
[9:09] see it went out one ear and out the
[9:11] other because they couldn't claim it
[9:14] personally for themselves and look what
[9:16] Paul is trying to warn usir the same
[9:18] thing can happen to us if we don't take
[9:21] God by his word if we don't put Faith in
[9:24] the equation because Faith as brother
[9:26] John said is the the vehicle that moves
[9:29] you closer to God and we got to get in
[9:31] that vehicle of faith and write in it
[9:34] and just take God in his word no matter
[9:36] where he leads you follow him
[9:39] amen verse 3 for we which have believed
[9:43] do enter into rest as he said I have
[9:47] sworn in my wrath if they shall enter
[9:49] into my rest although the works were
[9:52] finished from the foundation of the
[9:53] world verse 4 for he spake in a certain
[9:57] place in the seventh day on this wise
[9:58] and that and God did rest the seventh
[10:01] day from all his works
[10:03] for he's uh in in this place again that
[10:06] they shall enter into my rest seeing
[10:09] therefore remaineth that some must enter
[10:12] therein and they to whom it was first
[10:14] priest and are not in because of
[10:17] unbelief so we see God is looking for a
[10:21] believer that will grab a hold of him by
[10:23] faith and see they saw the mighty
[10:25] workings of God they saw the the plagues
[10:28] and all these other things the water
[10:30] come out of rock those the water become
[10:33] bitter into sweet they saw these things
[10:36] but faith never took a hold but we see
[10:39] Joshua and Caleb their faith took a hold
[10:42] and they could enter into that rest that
[10:45] Promised Land which is the type of the
[10:46] Holy Ghost and the rest that is talking
[10:49] about is not some keeping of a day but
[10:52] it's the Holy Ghost is your rest you're
[10:54] resting in the Holy Ghost that's what
[10:56] the prophet taught us that's what the
[10:57] word of God taught us he taught it he
[10:59] taught us in the word of God the prophet
[11:01] did
[11:02] and verse 7
[11:04] again he limits a certain day saying in
[11:07] David today after so a long time as it
[11:10] is said today if
[11:13] a conditional statement ye will hear him
[11:16] hear his voice Harden not your hearts so
[11:19] it's something that is personal God is
[11:22] speaking we said in the men's meeting if
[11:24] you're not in the right atmosphere the
[11:26] right heart condition You're Gonna Miss
[11:29] what God is saying to to tell you and we
[11:32] never want to come to church
[11:35] with a uh a pitchfork we want to rake it
[11:38] all in saying Lord this is all for me I
[11:40] need all this word I don't want to pick
[11:42] and choose what I want like a buffet but
[11:45] Lord I want everything on my plate just
[11:47] keep feeding me fill me to my cup is
[11:49] overflowing
[11:51] verse 9.
[11:54] therefore remaineth therefore a rest to
[11:57] the people of God and I believe I'm
[11:59] ministering to all the people of God
[12:00] here so there remaineth therefore a rest
[12:03] to all of us we can all can access this
[12:07] this rest and we're going to see how to
[12:09] access this rest in verse 11. let's read
[12:12] verse 10 first for he that is entered
[12:14] into his rest he hath also ceased from
[12:17] his own works as God did from his so
[12:20] you're no longer trying to figure
[12:22] everything out you're no longer trying
[12:23] to to plan your life in a selfish way
[12:26] but now you're looking to the mighty
[12:28] Creator and say Lord is this your will
[12:30] Lord where do you want me to go where
[12:33] are you trying to lead me to because
[12:36] Lord I want what's pleasing to you
[12:40] says let us labor therefore to enter
[12:45] into that rest so in order for you to
[12:48] labor you first have to surrender
[12:50] because if you're not surrendered you're
[12:53] not going to be able to labor into that
[12:55] rest because when you're surrendered
[12:57] you're fully committed you're fully sold
[12:59] out to the cause of Christ and we are
[13:01] fully sold out to the cause of Christ
[13:03] you know that you're laboring into that
[13:06] rest
[13:07] prayer is that key so let us labor
[13:10] therefore into that rest lest any man
[13:12] fall after the same example of unbelief
[13:15] amen let me go to verse 12 for the word
[13:19] of God is quick
[13:21] and powerful and sharper than any
[13:23] two-edged sword piercing even to the
[13:26] dividing asunder of Soul and Spirit and
[13:30] in the joints in Maryland is a discerner
[13:32] of the thoughts and intents of the heart
[13:34] neither is there any creature that is
[13:36] not manifesting in sight but all things
[13:38] are naked and open into the eyes of him
[13:41] with whom we have to do so we see the
[13:44] importance of this rest is something you
[13:46] got to labor to in every day that's
[13:48] something that you could just uh write
[13:49] the coattails of last week but it's
[13:52] something that you have to labor into
[13:54] you have to get in your knees you have
[13:56] to crucify the flesh this way he's
[13:58] talking about what laboring he said let
[14:00] us labor present tense not this past but
[14:03] labor therefore to enter into that rest
[14:06] and I know times we can get weary we can
[14:09] get broken down
[14:11] we need to rest God has everything under
[14:15] control the battle is not yours is his
[14:17] you must just play your part play the
[14:21] part that God has given each one of us
[14:22] to play and that worry can vanish that
[14:26] doubt can vanish this trust that he's
[14:29] beginning a good work in you he'll
[14:31] finish that good work you just had to
[14:33] keep that that uh keep it steadfast
[14:36] and put it right here it says
[14:39] in uh Hebrews three you know I'll just
[14:41] read in Hebrews three real fast give me
[14:43] one second
[14:45] so you gotta hold the beginning if we
[14:47] made partakers of Christ if conditional
[14:50] statement once again we hold the
[14:52] beginning of our con confidence
[14:54] steadfast and to the end and that's the
[14:56] key with all God is looking for right
[14:58] there
[14:59] let's get into a quote before we
[15:00] continue on
[15:02] that's where the church has come it's
[15:04] come through Martin Luther the just
[15:06] shall live by faith Wesley communion
[15:09] sanctification cleansing up and now
[15:12] we're in the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[15:14] rest I will give you rest unto your soul
[15:18] when a man went to the Intervale the
[15:21] second Veil he was hid from the world
[15:22] the curtains dropped around him and when
[15:25] we I love this and when we can loosen
[15:28] ourselves in Jesus Christ don't care
[15:31] what your denomination is then things
[15:34] don't bother you anymore you're just
[15:36] lost in Christ don't care what the
[15:39] howling mobs around say you're lost in
[15:41] Christ we can say we don't care what the
[15:43] news says we don't care what our family
[15:45] members or an occult says we don't care
[15:47] what they say because we're lost we got
[15:49] we're lost in Christ we've gave our life
[15:52] to Christ and we keep giving our life to
[15:54] Christ amen there's where the Shekinah
[15:57] Glory where the light that Halo that
[15:59] little ball of fire that come in behind
[16:01] the Altar and went down and settled in
[16:03] The Mercy Seat where the blood was and
[16:05] there it lit up the room that was from
[16:06] the power of decision 1955 and we'll go
[16:09] read another quote come on to me all you
[16:12] that labor and heavy laid and I will
[16:13] give you rest to your souls if you
[16:16] labored one day ten days five years 30
[16:19] years 50 years 90 years and you're tired
[16:22] and weary come on to me and I'll give
[16:25] you rest I'll take all that load of sin
[16:27] off of you and enter into you and give
[16:31] you perfect rest and satisfaction notice
[16:34] that he said that statement perfect rest
[16:36] this rest cannot fail this rest has
[16:40] stand the time through every Church age
[16:42] all seven of them it stand it's
[16:44] withstood the time this rest and you'll
[16:47] be satisfied you won't be yearning and
[16:49] wanting for things in the world because
[16:51] all you have need is Jesus Christ he's
[16:54] that that complete in your heart
[16:56] amen
[16:58] when Jesus
[17:01] now what is that rest we let's just
[17:04] settle this a bit and see what it is
[17:06] some of them said why you go join Church
[17:07] no you put your name on the book no well
[17:11] a certain kind of water baptism no let's
[17:13] just sell it and see what it is would
[17:16] you would you like to do that right here
[17:17] while we're waiting we'll see John went
[17:20] over uh to see what kind of day he went
[17:22] into when Jesus died upon the Earth and
[17:25] his work was finished he'd entered
[17:27] somewhere
[17:28] so we think about that that it's not
[17:31] about joining the church it's not about
[17:33] how how good of a you know this word but
[17:36] it's about knowing the author because we
[17:38] know the author you can enter into that
[17:40] rest it's about knowing him more than
[17:43] you did in an intimate way you did last
[17:45] week that's what God is calling us all
[17:47] too and so I'll look the word resting is
[17:50] a lot of times we like to kind of get
[17:52] that word when he says rest it's not you
[17:55] just laying down on the couch just
[17:56] relaxing you're still going through
[17:58] trials you're going to tribulations but
[18:01] you're anchored and you're not letting
[18:03] those things affect you your mind is
[18:06] focused and say Lord
[18:07] I know these trials are here for a
[18:09] reason and I'm focused I'm keeping my
[18:11] eyes on you because there's growth and
[18:13] potential that you have for me to reach
[18:15] and I want to reach it in the time that
[18:18] you've allowed me to reach it I don't
[18:20] want to have to go around the mountain
[18:21] again but I want to keep moving forward
[18:23] I want to keep gaining levels with you
[18:25] each day each week and that's the kind
[18:27] of attitude we need to have so resting
[18:29] is ceasing to move or act ceasing to be
[18:33] moved or agitated think about that
[18:36] leaning standing depending or relying so
[18:39] when you're resting you're literally
[18:41] you're depending upon God you're resting
[18:43] on God because he's proven time and time
[18:46] again that he's come through he can't
[18:48] fail you and so just like with David and
[18:50] Goliath we talked about last time he
[18:53] knew what what God did for him with the
[18:55] bear in The Line in that same giant was
[18:58] going to meet the same fate as that bear
[19:00] in The Lion and so we got to believe and
[19:02] sometimes we gotta just look back and
[19:04] see what God has done for us the places
[19:06] that we said last week where he's taken
[19:07] us from and if God could do that
[19:10] there's nothing impossible for him to do
[19:12] in your life
[19:14] so there's a Red Sea speaking move
[19:17] forward you want to cry to speak and
[19:19] move forward the words inside of you
[19:21] amen
[19:23] amen so I was uh I was listening to his
[19:26] Minister one time name is Joseph Prince
[19:28] and he said this statement he said the
[19:31] only the only labor he tells us to labor
[19:34] into is his rest think about that and he
[19:37] says when when you work I rest when you
[19:41] rest I work so when we're trying to get
[19:44] everything all figured out we got to
[19:46] know this is going to happen this way
[19:47] and that way and that way in that way
[19:48] God's like all right I guess you got to
[19:51] handle but when we get out of that state
[19:53] of mind and say Lord I don't know which
[19:55] way I need to go but you do and we start
[19:58] entering to that rest then God can begin
[20:01] working in your life see like we like to
[20:03] have our hands all over everything on
[20:05] the steering wheel and God's saying let
[20:07] me be the driver of your ship the driver
[20:09] of your car so I can lead your life the
[20:13] way it needs to go
[20:15] and I I was just thinking he said this
[20:17] other statement he's talking about Jesus
[20:18] was so busy he said no person has done
[20:22] as much as Jesus did in his three and a
[20:24] half years of ministry but it says he
[20:26] was so busy but he still following time
[20:29] to rest Jesus still following time to
[20:32] pray think about this people coming up
[20:34] to him asking to be here with him
[20:35] walking over here to jarius's daughter
[20:37] him doing this and doing that and doing
[20:38] that but still he found time to rest so
[20:42] if Jesus found time to rest being a very
[20:45] busy man then why can't we find time to
[20:49] enter into that rest Jesus was always at
[20:52] rest you never see him agitated or angry
[20:54] or going crazy but he was always resting
[20:57] he was always recharged and so we got to
[21:00] take note of our Lord and savior what he
[21:03] did he spent much time in prayer with
[21:06] the father so if he spent much time in
[21:08] prayer then we have to spend much time
[21:10] in prayer if we want to be rested as he
[21:12] was he says he said many more works
[21:15] shall we do because he went to the
[21:17] father amen let's go to Hebrews uh 4 and
[21:21] read verses 14 through 16.
[21:25] so start with verse 14.
[21:27] seeing then that we have a great high
[21:30] priest
[21:31] that is passed into the heavens Jesus
[21:34] the son of God let us hold fast our
[21:38] profession
[21:39] so this profession isn't a intellectual
[21:42] profession it has to be a heart
[21:44] profession and profession and confession
[21:46] mean the same thing you got to profess
[21:49] it from the heart not just Professor
[21:51] from lip service or from what you know
[21:53] or from that what Mr Jones experienced
[21:56] but you have to experience that you have
[21:58] to profess him as your own personal
[22:01] great high priest and you have to have a
[22:04] revelation that he's passing to the
[22:06] heavens verse 15. for we have not a high
[22:09] priest which cannot be touched with the
[22:11] feeling of our infirmities but was in
[22:13] all points tempted so Jesus knows what
[22:18] you're going through he was a man once
[22:21] like you and I was he felt temptation of
[22:25] women temptation of everything because
[22:27] it says all points it doesn't say just
[22:29] this one point so we serve a God who can
[22:33] relate to us personally we serve a God
[22:36] who walked on this Earth this has you
[22:38] and I walked he wore clothes he had to
[22:40] eat when he was hungry he had to rest
[22:42] when he was tired he had to do all these
[22:44] things that we had to do so we can
[22:46] relate to him so don't think that your
[22:49] situation is too big or too small for
[22:51] God to handle he can handle anything he
[22:54] he wants to fill your your sadness he
[22:57] wants to just hear your hearts cry he
[23:00] hears the tears when they fall on the
[23:02] ground that don't make us sound
[23:04] he loves you so stop trying to solve
[23:08] everything yourself just come to the
[23:11] great high priest that we can which can
[23:12] be touched by the feeling of your
[23:14] infirmities
[23:15] but was in all points tempted like as we
[23:18] are yet without sin says verse 16 let us
[23:22] therefore come boldly and this boldness
[23:25] isn't like Lord you owe me something but
[23:27] it's saying lord it's by your marriage
[23:30] by your grace I can come to your throne
[23:32] I'm bowing before your feet Lord just
[23:35] help me I need your help I need your
[23:37] grace in this this time of need
[23:40] and that's why we got how we got to see
[23:42] it as this Jesus Christ that we serve
[23:45] isn't some God that lives in the past
[23:47] but in Hebrews 13 he's the same
[23:49] yesterday today and forever he just as
[23:52] he cared about the children of Israel
[23:54] how much he loved him he loves you too
[23:56] he wants to shed that love upon you he
[23:59] wants to shower you with blessings
[24:02] amen
[24:04] and he said this other statement Joseph
[24:05] Prince said he said when the pain comes
[24:09] the supply is already there think about
[24:11] that when the pain comes the supply is
[24:14] already there brother Brahm say this
[24:16] statement you have everything you have
[24:17] need of inside of you
[24:20] so we're looking out to here and out to
[24:22] there but instead of looking out to it
[24:24] look at the god inside of you he has
[24:26] everything that you need when there's
[24:28] pain he he has Supply it you need money
[24:32] on the table he can supply it you need
[24:34] Deliverance he can supply it you need
[24:37] direction in your life he can supply it
[24:39] you want more Holy Ghost he can supply
[24:42] it you want more Revelation he can
[24:45] supply it
[24:46] you want to see your family saved he can
[24:48] supply it you want to win a soul to
[24:50] Christ he can supply it so we got to
[24:52] stop looking everywhere outside of the
[24:54] word of God we got to look into the word
[24:56] of God look into prayer because your
[24:58] answer is going to lie there it has to
[25:01] that's what he said
[25:03] amen amen
[25:05] so
[25:06] so profession is an open declaration a
[25:09] public of all or acknowledgment of one's
[25:12] sentiments or belief as professions or
[25:14] friendship or sincerity a profession of
[25:17] Faith or religion and confession is the
[25:19] act of acknowledging profession amen
[25:22] read a quote from the prophet
[25:25] now if you accept now what he has done
[25:28] for the Youth in now he is Hebrews three
[25:31] one he would say Hebrews 4 he's the high
[25:33] priest of our confession notice that now
[25:35] anyone knows the scripture knows that a
[25:38] word is written profession but it's the
[25:41] same word translated confession now in
[25:43] other words he cannot save you by the
[25:45] merits of your prayer notice that he
[25:47] cannot save you by the marriage of your
[25:49] enthusiasm no matter how much you click
[25:51] your heels together or shout in the
[25:52] spirit
[25:53] or your good works he saves you by the
[25:55] merits of your faith
[25:57] and your confession notice that for if
[26:00] you will confess me before men him will
[26:02] I confess before my father and the Holy
[26:04] Angels and whatever
[26:06] listen close any Redemptive blessing
[26:09] that's written in the word notice that
[26:11] any Redemptive blessing
[26:14] it written the word is for you
[26:16] you got to claim it by faith
[26:19] Luke 7 50 says
[26:21] and he said to the woman thy faith have
[26:23] saved thee so just think about that this
[26:26] woman made it in her heart
[26:28] that if she got to Jesus she knew that
[26:32] she knew that she knew that she would be
[26:33] healed she didn't let every wrong thing
[26:36] that happened to her life it didn't
[26:38] hinder her faith she knew that if she
[26:41] met with she heard about Jesus and she
[26:43] knew if she met this Jesus personally
[26:46] that her blood supply would be her her
[26:49] uh her infirmity would be healed and so
[26:52] the same thing with us tonight if our
[26:55] faith can just reach that pinnacle
[26:58] then we can receive what we're what we
[27:00] have asked for
[27:02] amen and that's all God is looking
[27:04] forward to see our faith being yet to
[27:06] cultivate that faith that God has given
[27:08] you we all have faith but we have to
[27:10] cultivate it like we said before it's
[27:12] like a muscle
[27:13] if I work out once a month I'm gonna get
[27:16] once a month results but if I'm working
[27:18] out three days a week five days a week
[27:20] I'm gonna get results but with faith
[27:22] faith has to be worked out seven days a
[27:24] week because that muscle has to be has
[27:26] to grow and the more you can grow the
[27:29] more you could take God in his word it
[27:31] builds your faith you can look back and
[27:33] just see all the things that God has has
[27:35] done in your life it's a faith booster
[27:37] even hearing a testimony from somebody
[27:39] else's a faith booster and we gotta be
[27:43] asking God for testimonies in our life
[27:45] God should be moving our life every day
[27:47] we should have testimonies somehow of
[27:49] him changing our nature every day
[27:50] whether it's a little baby step or a big
[27:52] step but God should be moving in our
[27:55] life and if he's not we're not resting
[27:57] we're not laboring we're not fighting on
[28:00] our knees because it's a battle of Faith
[28:02] every day and how you fight the Battle
[28:04] Is On Your Knees that's how you fight
[28:06] your battles
[28:07] her faith this is from Sir is what we
[28:11] see Jesus her faith touched him in such
[28:14] a way until he turned around and looked
[28:16] over his audience to see who touched him
[28:18] think about that
[28:19] thy faith have saved thee he even called
[28:22] her daughter if you know and I forget
[28:24] gospel he called her daughter she had a
[28:26] blood issue do you believe that that
[28:28] scripture well if he's the same
[28:30] yesterday today and forever isn't he the
[28:32] same when he's operating in our flesh
[28:36] amen
[28:37] isn't that right now
[28:40] let your faith touch him and see what he
[28:43] does about it think about that let your
[28:45] faith touch him and see what he does
[28:47] about it he knows you you have all these
[28:50] needs let's go to Hebrews 3.
[28:52] amen
[28:54] and we'll read seven chapter seven or
[28:55] verse 7 through 19.
[28:58] wherefore as the Holy Ghost said today
[29:01] if ye will hear his voice once again
[29:04] conditional statement is if it's talking
[29:07] to a it's a personal level if you will
[29:11] hear his voice not if sister Anna here
[29:14] Voice or Brother Joseph but if you will
[29:16] hear his voice personally because they
[29:17] can't hear the voice for of God for you
[29:19] you have to hear the voice of God for
[29:21] yourself personally so remember verse 8
[29:23] heart not your heart says in the
[29:25] provocation in the day of the Temptation
[29:27] in the wilderness when your fathers
[29:30] tempted me and proved me and saw my
[29:32] Works 40 years think about that
[29:35] wherefore I always grieve with that
[29:37] generation and said they do always err
[29:40] in their hearts and they have not known
[29:42] my ways
[29:44] so I swear in my wrath they shall not
[29:46] enter into my rest look what Paul's
[29:49] saying right here he's given us a
[29:50] warning he's he's trying to warn the
[29:52] church he's trying to warn the the bride
[29:54] of Christ take heed Brethren lest there
[29:57] be in any of you an evil heart of
[30:01] unbelief in departing from the Living
[30:04] God so he's given us a warning
[30:07] but exhort one another daily notice that
[30:10] we got to be exhorting one another daily
[30:12] we have to we live in such a Dark Age
[30:14] where the darkness the enemy of darkness
[30:17] is just trying to tear us down piece by
[30:19] piece and we got to encourage one we got
[30:22] to build one another we gotta just speak
[30:24] the word over one another pray for one
[30:26] another earnestly because the enemy is
[30:29] like a roaring lion seeking whom he may
[30:31] devour
[30:34] amen lest any of you should be hardened
[30:36] through the deceitfulness of sin verse
[30:38] 14 we see that conditional statement
[30:40] once again if we are made partakers of
[30:42] Christ if
[30:44] we hold the beginning of our confident
[30:48] steadfast and to the end just like
[30:50] running a race if I'm running a say a
[30:52] mile race and I just give I I'm just I
[30:55] beat everybody the first lap but the
[30:57] last lap I'm trailing behind and I lost
[30:59] that that whole lap I won didn't do me
[31:02] any good because I didn't win anything
[31:04] so the same thing in our walk with
[31:05] Christ yeah if it's good to start off
[31:08] good but if you don't finish good what's
[31:10] the point you want to start off good you
[31:12] want to finish good and keep it that way
[31:14] because God isn't see a lot of times
[31:17] human beings we look at the accolades
[31:18] that we have I did this I did this back
[31:20] in the past in the past but Paul said
[31:22] forgetting those things are behind and
[31:24] pressing towards those things which are
[31:26] ahead so it's good to you know thank the
[31:29] Lord for passion accomplishment you
[31:30] can't live in the past the past is the
[31:33] past is done and you got to live in the
[31:35] now in the future because every decision
[31:37] you make now is going to determine your
[31:39] future outcome so it's so important
[31:41] that's why Paul is just really just
[31:43] trying to stir the inside with us just
[31:45] to really focus on this verse 15. well
[31:48] it said today
[31:50] if notice that you will hear his voice
[31:52] hard not your hearts as in the
[31:54] provocation for someone they had heard
[31:56] did provoke how be it not all that came
[31:59] out of Egypt by Moses verse 17 but whom
[32:02] if he was grieved 40 years was not with
[32:04] them that had sinned whose carcasses
[32:06] fell in the wilderness and to whom he
[32:08] swear that they should not enter into
[32:10] rest but to them that believe not so we
[32:13] see that they could not enter in because
[32:14] of unbelief so they couldn't enter into
[32:17] that what Isaiah the weary should rest
[32:19] they couldn't enter into that rest
[32:21] because of unbelief so we got to believe
[32:23] that that rest is for us personally
[32:26] that Holy Ghost is for us brother Bernie
[32:28] said this statement in order for you to
[32:30] receive the holy egos you got to believe
[32:31] that the Holy Ghost is for you so you
[32:33] got to believe that that rest is for you
[32:35] and we need more Holy Ghost to keep in
[32:39] turn into that rest that rests position
[32:40] to stay there it's because I'm Mark
[32:42] Cosby but if that rest stays there
[32:44] because I'm laboring into it I'm
[32:46] fighting for that rest because the devil
[32:48] knows that if you're in that rest he's
[32:50] powerless so he's constantly trying to
[32:53] distract you constantly trying to get
[32:56] you to look behind but if we keep our
[32:58] eyes focused and labor into that rest
[33:01] then he's going to be powerless in our
[33:02] life yeah he's going to still try to do
[33:04] things but you're going to have the
[33:06] power of Christ residing around you and
[33:08] in you and that's what we need to fight
[33:10] this battle
[33:11] amen
[33:13] so I like the word labor so it means to
[33:16] work at to till to cultivate so we said
[33:19] before we gotta we gotta cultivate that
[33:22] Faith so when God speaks to us in a
[33:24] service a message uh reading the word of
[33:27] God we gotta take what we heard we gotta
[33:30] apply it to our lives and cultivate it
[33:33] amen
[33:35] so in order we said before in order to
[33:36] labor you must first surrender you have
[33:38] to fully commit yourself to Jesus Christ
[33:40] and we just see that the Holy Ghost says
[33:42] that rest and that's why it's so
[33:44] important for us to get more Holy Ghost
[33:47] the more of God we can get the more
[33:50] rests we will have and say one more time
[33:51] the more of God we can get the more rest
[33:55] we will have the more we can fulfill his
[33:57] will the more we can build together the
[33:59] more we can witness the souls the more
[34:01] we can uh you fill in the blank it's
[34:04] Limitless
[34:06] amen amen so in order for us to enter to
[34:09] that rest we're going to go to Matthew
[34:10] 7.
[34:11] uh Matthew 7 13-14 we said we must labor
[34:15] we must play our part and we must strive
[34:18] to enter in so we got to strive to keep
[34:21] in that straight and narrow that's the
[34:23] key
[34:28] so Matthew 7 and read verses 13-14 and
[34:32] then we'll hop to Matthew 6. so it says
[34:35] enter ye and at the Straight Gate once
[34:37] again personal so enter ye at the
[34:40] Straight Gate for wide is the gate and
[34:42] Broad is the way that leads to
[34:43] destruction and many there be which
[34:45] going there at so it's the scripture is
[34:47] telling me that this straight and narrow
[34:49] gate
[34:50] is hard to enter into and actually it's
[34:53] saying that more people are going to
[34:55] choose to go to the wide gate because
[34:57] it's easy it's appealing to the flesh it
[35:00] makes you feel good
[35:02] so is look at verse verse 14 says
[35:05] because straight is the gate
[35:07] and narrow is the way which Leath unto
[35:09] life
[35:10] and few there be that find it if you
[35:14] want to labor to find if you want to
[35:16] labor to see some people might start off
[35:18] on the Straight Gate but then go off so
[35:21] you gotta be willing to take the
[35:23] reproach you'll be willing to take the
[35:25] persecutions because the Christian life
[35:27] isn't an easy life it's a hard rugged
[35:29] life for a reason it was a lot easier
[35:31] probably living in a world like brother
[35:32] Ferguson said but when we come to God
[35:36] that's when the devil puts a Target on
[35:38] your back
[35:39] because because he you he's been you've
[35:42] been taken away from his kingdom and in
[35:44] the God's kingdom now and he thought
[35:46] that you were his property but he didn't
[35:47] realize that you were God's Property
[35:49] this whole time that's why he's
[35:51] constantly trying to deter us so because
[35:53] straight is the gate and narrow is the
[35:55] way which leads unto life few there be
[35:58] that find it and the straight and
[35:59] narrows only room for you and Jesus
[36:01] that's the only two people could be in
[36:03] that road together amen let's go to
[36:05] Matthew 6.
[36:09] so as I was as I was studying this
[36:12] subject
[36:14] I I didn't realize I love this how the
[36:16] Lord this the scriptures is dovetailed
[36:18] together I was looking at Matthew 11
[36:20] Isaiah 28 Hebrews 4. they all dovetailed
[36:24] together they're all talking about the
[36:25] same rest and I was just like I was like
[36:27] thank you Jesus
[36:28] and just when the Lord just opens the
[36:31] scriptures up like that because the
[36:32] scripture is all a dovetail they have to
[36:34] it's the word of God but I just love
[36:36] when he opens it up to us and to see
[36:38] that that same rest that Jesus was
[36:40] talking about in Matthew 11 Paul was
[36:43] talking about the same rest that Jesus
[36:44] was talking about and the same rest that
[36:46] Isaiah was talking about was the same
[36:48] rest that Jesus was talking about said
[36:50] all the dovetails together so if you're
[36:52] weary come labor to that rest amen let's
[36:55] go let's go to um Matthew 6 25.
[36:58] therefore I say unto you take no thought
[37:00] for your life what ye shall eat or what
[37:02] you shall drink nor yet for your body
[37:04] what you should put on it's not the life
[37:07] more than the meat and the body than the
[37:09] remnant behold the fowls of the air for
[37:12] they so not need to do they reap nor
[37:14] gather into barns get your heavenly
[37:16] father feedeth him are ye not much
[37:19] better than they which of You by taking
[37:21] thought can add one cubit to a stature
[37:24] and why take you thought from Remnant
[37:27] consider the lilies of the field how
[37:29] they grow and they toil not neither do
[37:31] they spin and think about the statement
[37:34] Jesus said right here in 29 yet I say
[37:36] unto you that even Solomon and All His
[37:38] glory was not arrayed like one of these
[37:40] that's a powerful statement we think of
[37:43] Solomon a man a man of God but he's
[37:46] saying Jesus said and yet I say unto you
[37:48] that even Solomon in all his glory was
[37:51] not a raid like one of these I mean I
[37:53] said so profound
[37:55] verse 30 wherefore if God so clothed the
[37:58] grass of the field which today is and
[38:00] tomorrow is cast into the oven shall he
[38:03] not much more clothe you you little
[38:05] faith therefore take no thoughts saying
[38:08] what we shall eat or what shall we drink
[38:10] or worry shall be clothed how I'm going
[38:11] to pay this bill how I'm gonna get a
[38:13] brand new car uh I need a place to live
[38:16] uh whatever you fill in the blank
[38:18] therefore take no thoughts saying that
[38:20] for after all these things to the
[38:22] Gentiles seek for your heavenly father
[38:24] knoweth that you have need of all these
[38:27] things that statement we said when when
[38:30] the pain is there when the need's there
[38:31] the supply is already there we just got
[38:33] to believe that the supplies already
[38:34] there
[38:35] in verse I love I list my favorite
[38:38] probably scriptures 6 33. but seek ye
[38:41] first the kingdom of God labor into that
[38:43] rest that's what it's telling me labor
[38:45] into that rest because when you're
[38:46] seeking the kingdom of God you're
[38:48] laboring you're saying Lord I'm putting
[38:50] your will first I'm putting you
[38:52] first in my life and Lord you promise to
[38:55] take care of all these needs all I have
[38:57] to do is seek you seek your face seek
[39:01] your heart seek your will that's all I
[39:02] have to do you told me to love you with
[39:05] all my heart all my mind all my soul
[39:06] that's all you're calling me to do and
[39:08] Lord I want to love you more each day I
[39:10] want to fall so deep and madly in love
[39:13] with you that everything around me this
[39:15] that's a distraction this Fades away
[39:18] but seek ye first the kingdom of God
[39:21] labor into that rest his labor and his
[39:23] righteousness and all these things shall
[39:25] be added unto you man this this study
[39:28] and I love the Lord this studying this I
[39:30] deceived Matthew 6 in a new light now
[39:32] like I've never seen it before Jesus
[39:34] said all these things that we can worry
[39:36] about
[39:37] then then Jesus saying come unto me oh
[39:39] that header lady and I'll give you rest
[39:40] in Paul saying labor into that rest
[39:42] that's all God is telling us to do is
[39:44] play our part labor labor to enter and
[39:48] labor to that rest
[39:51] verse 34 take therefore no thought for
[39:53] the morrow for the morrow shall take
[39:55] thought for the things of itself
[39:57] deficient to the day is the evil thereof
[40:02] so we must just see the importance of
[40:04] faith
[40:05] it says in Hebrews 4 2 for unto us was
[40:08] the Gospel preached as well unto them
[40:10] but the word priest did not profit them
[40:13] not being mixed with faith in them that
[40:15] heard it
[40:16] brother Johnson brother John quote
[40:17] brother John he said if you don't
[40:19] exercise faith it will shrink exercise
[40:22] the faith God has given you
[40:25] we said before faith is the vehicle
[40:26] faith is the vehicle we use to move
[40:29] forward with God
[40:31] see the the battle that we have to fight
[40:33] is the battle for faith we have to fight
[40:36] to enter into that rest it's not
[40:37] something that just falls into your lap
[40:39] send a Christmas present it's not a
[40:41] birthday present you have to fight every
[40:44] day for because the devil hates to see a
[40:47] Christian resting because when a
[40:49] Christian is resting he can't torment
[40:51] them but when a Christian is resting he
[40:54] is powerless he can do what he wants to
[40:56] do but that Christian's focused on Jesus
[40:59] Christ his eyes Can't Be Moved it's like
[41:01] a horse with blinders
[41:02] I'm talking about the men's meaning how
[41:04] a horse they put blinders on so the
[41:06] horse can't look left to right and see
[41:07] straight and we got to put our spiritual
[41:09] blinders on so we're not looking over
[41:12] here and over there but we're looking
[41:13] just straight to Christ because he's the
[41:16] reason why we're here
[41:19] amen
[41:20] you have to believe that like I said you
[41:23] got to claim that rest for your life
[41:25] disclaim it
[41:27] and that you can obtain that rest you
[41:30] have to believe that you don't have to
[41:31] live this life alone that there's a lord
[41:34] and savior that loves you with all his
[41:36] heart and wants to help you he wants to
[41:38] strengthen you he wants to be he wants
[41:40] you to be an overcomer he wants to see
[41:42] you prosper spiritually and physically
[41:45] see he wants to shower us with blessings
[41:47] but a lot of times we're just looking
[41:49] for these natural blessings and God is
[41:51] looking for the soul prospering
[41:53] blessings and that's what true
[41:56] prospering is just because some person
[41:58] has a nice car and a fancy house doesn't
[42:00] mean he's any closer to God than the
[42:03] next person in the world so what truly
[42:05] is going to just mean that you're
[42:08] prospering is your soul prospering is
[42:10] your nature prospering are you are you
[42:12] able to love people without uh without a
[42:17] measure
[42:19] because Jesus told us that we got to
[42:21] love one another we gotta love our
[42:22] enemies
[42:24] and that's what true
[42:26] progression means to me it's a love of
[42:28] God just being shed abroad in our hearts
[42:30] more and more and more and more that we
[42:33] can love one another that love of God we
[42:35] can love when somebody just stabs Us in
[42:38] the back we can bless in that curse so
[42:40] we can pray for them that despitefully
[42:41] used us that's the only love of God can
[42:44] accomplish that so we just see Jeremiah
[42:47] 29 11 I'm just going to read it for I
[42:49] know the thoughts that I think toward
[42:50] you say the Lord thoughts of peace and
[42:53] not of evil to give you an expected end
[42:55] so the Lord just thinks thoughts of
[42:57] Peace for us
[42:59] and we got to just believe that no
[43:01] matter how hard it is in our life right
[43:03] now that peace is going to be at the end
[43:06] of that tunnel that Victory is going to
[43:09] be into that tunnel you just got to keep
[43:11] strong keep marching forward with the
[43:14] light he's giving you just keep
[43:15] believing it keep trusting it keep
[43:17] speaking victory over it keep speaking
[43:19] the name of Jesus in your situation and
[43:22] you will overcome
[43:23] I don't know how many ever heard that
[43:25] song I I speak I want to speak the name
[43:27] of Jesus
[43:28] so I I love this song too because it's
[43:31] just sometimes we just we just got to
[43:33] speak the name of Jesus
[43:35] I just want to speak the name of Jesus
[43:37] over every heart and every mind because
[43:39] I know there's peace within your
[43:41] presence I speak Jesus I just want to
[43:45] speak the name of Jesus to every dark
[43:47] addiction starts to break declaring
[43:49] there is hope and there is freedom I
[43:52] speak Jesus he says because your name is
[43:54] power your name is healing your name is
[43:56] life like I love this too break every
[43:59] stronghold shine through the Shadows
[44:02] burn like a flower
[44:03] fire shout Jesus from the mountains
[44:06] Jesus in the streets Jesus in the
[44:09] darkness over every enemy Jesus for my
[44:12] family I speak the Holy Name of Jesus
[44:15] think about that statement I just the
[44:18] name of Jesus
[44:20] not even a demon can handle that name of
[44:23] Jesus when when Jesus walked towards
[44:26] Legion he said all you come to tone with
[44:28] me already
[44:29] this when Jesus is on the scene there's
[44:33] no darkness that can stay it'll fade
[44:36] away every time
[44:38] amen a couple quotes
[44:40] we're almost done
[44:42] did you ever meet a person that's been
[44:44] in there this is from why are people so
[44:46] tossed about 1956 January 1st
[44:49] did you ever meet a person that's been
[44:51] in there and has tasted and living on
[44:53] this manna you can meet him on Monday
[44:55] Tuesday Wednesday Thursday Friday
[44:58] Saturday Sunday cloudy day Bright Day
[45:01] gloomy day things are going right wrong
[45:04] he's always sweet always full of love
[45:08] never talked or do anything wrong he's
[45:11] living under the glory of God
[45:14] he never gets hungry he never has to go
[45:16] to church to get built up
[45:18] Now that statement he's saying see a lot
[45:20] of times we go for we go to church
[45:22] because we're all beaten down and
[45:24] wearing like oh man I barely made it in
[45:26] I need this but if we would just be
[45:29] desperate not just on Wednesdays and
[45:31] Sundays but seven days a week when we
[45:33] come to church
[45:34] we wouldn't it wouldn't have to just
[45:35] build us up here but we'll be getting
[45:37] built up everywhere we go we can be on
[45:39] fire in church brother Bram said this
[45:41] statement if you can get two or three
[45:44] good members that are on fire for God in
[45:48] the church it will do more than 40
[45:50] revivals could do think about that
[45:52] there's two or three members on fire for
[45:54] God that they're every time they come to
[45:56] church they're bringing the presence of
[45:58] God they're bringing the fire of God and
[46:00] a forest fire is contagious
[46:02] it spreads and so that's what he that's
[46:06] what he's trying to say you have to go
[46:07] to church to get built up a lot of times
[46:09] we just bring all our problems we're
[46:11] just like oh man I barely made it
[46:14] one more quote
[46:16] but as it come here if it is then your
[46:19] whole makeup is Christ your attitude
[46:22] your desires your appetite your
[46:24] everything is Christ yielded resting
[46:28] everything perfect no matter how dough
[46:30] it looks or how black it looks
[46:33] still it's the same Christ is in you
[46:36] so this in closing the rise to our feet
[46:40] this labor has been given to all of us
[46:42] this rest has been given to all of us
[46:45] are you willing to labor into that rest
[46:48] where you don't have to do everything
[46:49] yourself anymore let go and let God have
[46:52] his way think about that song let go and
[46:55] let God have his way
[46:57] he knows the problems you're going to
[46:59] face he knows the issues the roadblocks
[47:01] are going to happen
[47:03] don't it's not a surprise to him he's
[47:05] just waiting for his son or his daughter
[47:07] to say

[47:13] sufficient when I'm weak
