[0:00] amen amen turn with me if you would to
[0:02] the Book of James chapter
[0:05] 1 uh this has been a little thought
[0:08] that's been on my heart for a few weeks
[0:11] now a couple couple couple weeks anyways
[0:15] uh two to three weeks and um just
[0:19] waiting for the the right time for the
[0:21] Lord uh to bless it and we trust it is
[0:26] it's in his
[0:28] time and and uh thank you that you've
[0:31] been praying God bless everyone that's
[0:33] watching on a line and sorry that you
[0:37] can't be here I'm sure you feel the same
[0:39] way um we'd love and can't wait till
[0:42] we're back together again everybody amen
[0:46] when when we all get to heaven what a
[0:47] day of rejoicing that will be
[0:50] and I I I will say we did finally get
[0:53] our our application to from the building
[0:57] department that we can start presently
[1:00] working on it so we got the green light
[1:03] in that direction and now we just are
[1:06] are are walking in the next step so keep
[1:09] keep that in prayer I'm I'm thankful
[1:11] that I gave up on the pressure of time
[1:15] yeah right that's right I I deal with
[1:17] that enough at work you know due dates
[1:19] brother Ron knows all about it got to
[1:21] get it done now that very fact that
[1:24] here's the date creates
[1:26] pressure and
[1:28] um God does everything beautiful in his
[1:31] time that's right amen amen before we
[1:34] begin reading here in verse 19 let's
[1:36] look to the author and a word of prayer
[1:39] father we thank you for your precious
[1:41] word we thank you that you anointed
[1:44] James to repend these words that we're
[1:46] going to
[1:47] read and Lord we as humans have went to
[1:51] school and we've been taught how to read
[1:55] and understand what certain words mean
[1:58] and we certainly have
[2:01] uh an idea what what words mean and and
[2:05] just about anybody Lord that would uh go
[2:07] to school it have a a a a good
[2:11] understanding of uh what um these words
[2:15] would mean uh in the natural uh but God
[2:20] we don't want uh the our own thoughts we
[2:24] want to be uh in the spirit and we want
[2:28] to be totally yielding to the Holy Ghost
[2:32] and Lord we ask that that same anointing
[2:34] that anointed James when he penned this
[2:37] Lord that it would come upon us today to
[2:39] receive it may it become more real today
[2:43] uh than when we uh entered into the
[2:45] doors father bless this word and give
[2:48] Revelation now to each and every heart
[2:50] we'll give you the praise and honor for
[2:52] it as we've been praying for this uh
[2:55] prior to this service now in Jesus
[2:57] Christ's name amen amen Jam James
[3:00] chapter 1 starting here with verse
[3:01] number
[3:04] 19 uh wherefore my
[3:06] brethren let every man be swift to hear
[3:10] and slow to speak and slow to
[3:13] wrath for the wrath of man worketh not
[3:16] the righteousness of God wherefore lay
[3:20] apart all filthiness and
[3:23] superfluity of naughtiness and receive
[3:26] with meekness the engrafted word which
[3:30] is able to save your souls now we all
[3:34] feel here that our souls are
[3:39] saved so why would we need the scripture
[3:42] because it's he that endureth to the end
[3:44] we've got to continue in the word amen
[3:46] that's right but be ye doers of the word
[3:49] and not hearers only deceiving your own
[3:53] selves for if any be a hearer of the
[3:56] word and not a doer he is like unto a
[3:59] man beholding his natural face in a
[4:02] glass for he beholdeth himself and goeth
[4:05] his way and straight way forgiveth what
[4:07] manner of man he was but whosoever
[4:11] lookth into the perfect law of Liberty
[4:13] and continu with therein he being not a
[4:17] forgetful hearer but a doer of the work
[4:21] this man shall be blessed in his deed
[4:24] amen let's finish the chapter If any man
[4:26] among you seem to be religious and
[4:28] bridleth not not his tongue but
[4:31] deceiveth his own heart this man's
[4:34] religion is considered vain but pure
[4:38] religion none defiled before God and the
[4:41] father is
[4:43] this to visit the
[4:46] fatherless and the widows in their
[4:50] Affliction and to keep himself
[4:53] unspotted from the world it looks like
[4:57] they're doers of the word
[5:00] amen God bless you you may be
[5:04] seated well we want to entitle this do
[5:09] it and for a subject your decision after
[5:13] hearing the word your decision after
[5:15] hearing the word now John Martin this is
[5:20] John Martin's three states of
[5:23] Readiness three states of Readiness the
[5:27] first
[5:28] state is the state of being ready we had
[5:31] that little series about being ready we
[5:33] never quite finished it but we're going
[5:35] to touch on a few things because I
[5:37] believe the Holy Ghost really wanted
[5:40] things to be said but I just felt it was
[5:45] strong but the bride needs all the word
[5:49] that's right now Jesus told us be ready
[5:51] be ready at all times for his return and
[5:55] and labor continuously for his kingdom
[5:58] until he returns amen so being ready is
[6:02] living a life whereby you're pressing
[6:04] towards the
[6:05] mark the mark of His Image you want to
[6:08] become just like Jesus you're walking in
[6:11] the spirit of the Lord now this is the
[6:13] first state of being ready amen now the
[6:17] second state is right before being ready
[6:20] you're in the state of getting ready
[6:23] amen you're not only aware of not being
[6:26] ready but more importantly you're
[6:28] actively moving moving forward you're
[6:31] consciously putting forth
[6:33] effort you've accepted that there are
[6:36] things in your life that need to be
[6:39] overcomed and you're making Necessary
[6:41] changes in your life you're you're
[6:43] digging more into the message of the
[6:44] hour you're actively involved in the
[6:46] word at church amen and you're seriously
[6:50] moving forward so that to me is you're
[6:52] in the state of getting ready right amen
[6:56] the third state is the state of being
[6:58] stuck in
[7:00] Leia you have a form of godliness you're
[7:04] going to church still you're paying your
[7:06] tie you're listening to the sermons but
[7:09] your spiritual life is
[7:12] stagnated whether you make it to church
[7:15] on time or
[7:16] not doesn't really make a big
[7:21] difference or whether you make it at all
[7:24] it's not a big deal to you you're really
[7:26] not digging into the message of the hour
[7:30] you're not making time to read your
[7:32] Bible right you're just hanging around
[7:36] you're just going through the motions
[7:37] and sometimes acting religious when
[7:43] needed now this morning I'd like to try
[7:46] to help anyone who may be stuck in that
[7:50] state of apostasy and
[7:54] uncaring and also if you view yourself
[7:56] in the second condition this message
[7:59] will help you get over the hump and be
[8:03] ready and if you are ready this message
[8:07] will be a warning of how the enemy will
[8:09] try to deceive you that's right in other
[8:12] words this message is for everybody
[8:14] that's right i' like to take our our
[8:17] text from verse number 25 but whosoever
[8:20] lookth into the perfect law of Liberty
[8:22] and continueth therein he being not a
[8:25] forgetful hearer but a doer of the work
[8:27] this man shall be blessed in his deeds
[8:30] that's right
[8:32] amen blessed in his deeds Amelia nhart
[8:37] said the most effective way to do it is
[8:41] do
[8:43] it and we don't want to complicate it
[8:47] with do I really have to right is that
[8:50] really
[8:52] necessary is that just that's probably
[8:55] just for certain
[8:57] people right just do it
[9:01] amen we spent more time in prayer this
[9:04] morning amen so we might be more ready
[9:08] to hear the word than to offer the
[9:11] sacrifice of fools remember that
[9:14] message and the god that we serve now is
[9:18] showing us here that hearing is not
[9:21] enough amen that's we need to be more
[9:23] ready to hear than all for the saice but
[9:25] hearing is not enough now we got to be a
[9:28] doer
[9:29] that's right isn't that beautiful he
[9:32] doesn't want us to forget it he wants us
[9:34] to leave here and do it am be a doer of
[9:38] the work the Bible says God wants to see
[9:42] his word materialized in us become alive
[9:46] amen come off the book and become living
[9:50] in his children amen his
[9:54] wife now in order for this to transpire
[9:57] the word must become more or real to
[10:00] us we can't imagine or pretend that the
[10:03] word is real to us that's right we can't
[10:06] sit around and be double-minded with
[10:09] God's thoughts and wonder if it's really
[10:11] going to happen or not we've got to
[10:13] accept God's word as a reality for us
[10:16] amen then and only then can it begin to
[10:19] work and materialize inside of us amen I
[10:23] believe you have to believe the word
[10:25] when it's preached not just hear it but
[10:27] you have to believe it
[10:31] amen then to show forth your faith in
[10:34] the word that you've heard and leave
[10:36] here and go do
[10:39] it you go out by
[10:43] faith you put your foot in the water you
[10:46] trust God that he's going to separate
[10:48] your situation and you're going to move
[10:50] forward there's a part that you play
[10:53] it's the part of Faith it's the part of
[10:56] your confidence in God
[11:00] amen it's you showing forth trust and
[11:03] then God will do the
[11:06] rest brother brandom said in the message
[11:10] the word became
[11:12] flesh he said now if you got a double
[11:15] mind and you don't believe it yeah you
[11:19] just say well I just wonder he says you
[11:21] better watch out that's right he says
[11:24] it's got to be a change here it is a
[11:27] change of heart not of this physical
[11:32] thing but the heart of your soul and
[11:35] something anchors to your thoughts that
[11:38] that way is I'm sorry until your
[11:41] thoughts that way is dull you don't see
[11:45] it no more that's good you just see the
[11:48] Lord Jesus you see righteousness and
[11:51] Holiness and Purity and love and
[11:53] grace that's when you'll be changed
[11:56] that's right what is a convert
[11:59] convert means to be changed to change
[12:02] something
[12:03] over and your thoughts your habits your
[12:07] being has been changed from a sinner to
[12:10] a Christian the first thing you know in
[12:11] your heart then you express it with your
[12:14] lips and then it materializes and that's
[12:17] what you
[12:19] are and it starts with hearing the word
[12:22] now if you think that you think it what
[12:26] a
[12:27] word but you imagine it you think
[12:32] it and you express it and it doesn't
[12:36] materialize then you're on the wrong
[12:38] road so if you think that you're
[12:39] thinking it but already what you're
[12:41] doing is imagining
[12:43] it it won't materialize he
[12:46] said I love this because it makes it
[12:49] real clear whether we're really getting
[12:51] Revelation or not when we if we see it
[12:54] manifested when we leave here right he
[12:56] says you get it maybe I better let that
[13:00] maybe I better just go a little slower
[13:01] he said look if you imagine you're a
[13:04] Christian and you speak it out with your
[13:07] lips but you find out that you're not
[13:11] you better get your thoughts changed get
[13:14] your heart change see because it doesn't
[13:16] bear record it doesn't bear the fruit of
[13:19] it but the fruit of the spirit is
[13:21] gentleness peace longsuffering goodness
[13:22] meekness and faith if every little thing
[13:25] comes along and you fly off at it be
[13:28] careful you better be careful there's
[13:30] something that hasn't happened you're
[13:34] expressing something here that's not
[13:36] you're expressing something here that's
[13:38] not
[13:41] here amen good
[13:45] quote we understand that the only way
[13:48] God can live God that we can live the
[13:51] life is God living it through us only
[13:53] only God can live his life only the Holy
[13:56] Spirit can live out the life of the Holy
[13:58] Spirit
[13:59] it
[14:02] right and I like how uh James said
[14:05] it he said we can't just be a hearer of
[14:08] the word but we need to be a doer of the
[14:12] work in order for this to happen the
[14:14] holy spirit's got to come inside of us
[14:17] and do the work am because he's the only
[14:20] one that can do the
[14:24] worken I love it amen I love it's making
[14:27] it it's causing me to get desperate for
[14:30] more of God that's what he wants in this
[14:34] relationship in the me message the uh
[14:37] fundamental foundation for faith brother
[14:39] B says now if you want to go back a
[14:41] little further just as far as a as
[14:44] historical you can see uh the word in
[14:47] the beginning was the word but what was
[14:50] the word a word is a a thought
[14:52] manifested a thought spoken forth God
[14:55] first he perceived the thought and spoke
[14:57] it and meant it and became a word and
[14:59] the word became material amen so
[15:03] everything that God has spoken in his
[15:06] word received into the right
[15:08] channel will
[15:10] materialize that word for whatever the
[15:13] promise behind it is God will do it he
[15:17] is obligated to do
[15:19] it then if you abide in me and my word
[15:21] abide in you then you have God the word
[15:25] in you and you believe the word just as
[15:27] you believe God because it is God and
[15:30] it's
[15:31] Inseparable then if you have God's word
[15:33] in you you have God's life in you you
[15:37] have God in you and whatsoever God's
[15:40] word speaks forth out of you it'll have
[15:42] to come to pass just like it was spoke
[15:46] from
[15:48] God you and God are becoming one there's
[15:52] a Oneness that's happening
[15:56] Hallelujah now James is speaking of of
[15:59] two categories
[16:03] hearers and doers hearers only and doers
[16:07] let me reward that because in order to
[16:08] be a doer you have to be a
[16:10] hearer but if you're hearer only and not
[16:14] a doer that's two different categories
[16:16] so I wrote some stuff down a hearer only
[16:19] is someone who is not serious with God
[16:22] but a doer is serious with God a hearer
[16:27] only he doesn't care very much but a
[16:31] doer cares a
[16:32] lot a here
[16:35] only by definition of
[16:37] Love is is not a lover of the word a
[16:42] hearer only is not a lover of the word
[16:45] but a doer loves the
[16:49] word a hearer enjoys hearing only some
[16:54] of the word now this you'll see it
[16:56] because there's we all like love to hear
[16:58] the word word I'll say it like this more
[17:00] properly part of the
[17:02] word true the word that feels good the
[17:05] the word that energizes makes you feel
[17:08] good and clean and and God loves me
[17:12] right but we don't enjoy hearing the
[17:14] word of laying down our lives and giving
[17:16] up our time and and and following suit
[17:19] with things that we don't enjoy
[17:23] doing so a doer enjoys all the Worden
[17:29] a
[17:30] hearer could be considered more of a
[17:34] gambler a doer does not
[17:38] gamble right that's why he he's not
[17:41] going to gamble with the word he's going
[17:42] to do it amen see Satan says you don't
[17:47] got to do that yeah that's rightly
[17:50] Gambler a here only is careless
[17:54] Frolic and
[17:56] unaware jokes around about with
[18:03] things but a doer is sober he's Vigilant
[18:08] he's alert he's watchful because at any
[18:11] moment at any time Satan could come and
[18:14] try to trick you up through anybody
[18:16] that's
[18:18] true a
[18:20] hearer only he doesn't want to suffer
[18:24] but a doer suffers willingly for others
[18:29] a hearer only he's blind as a
[18:34] bat so what the Bible that's what James
[18:37] said but a doer has x-ray vision amen
[18:41] praise the
[18:43] Lord here only he he he just puts his
[18:47] time in he just goes to church puts his
[18:49] time
[18:49] in but a doer can't wait to hear what
[18:52] God has for them to
[18:53] [Music]
[18:55] do here only
[19:08] um a hearer only leans towards not being
[19:13] his sheep now what I mean by that Jesus
[19:16] said as a doer my sheep hear my voice
[19:18] and they follow
[19:21] me but if you think about it if you're
[19:23] not following the word if you're not
[19:25] doing the word you're just hearing
[19:28] you're really not following so a hearer
[19:31] only doesn't really lean towards
[19:33] following Jesus he just thinks he is
[19:35] that's the
[19:37] deception a here
[19:39] only it's just knowledge at
[19:43] most but a doer is actually the
[19:45] revelation of the
[19:47] word a hear only is building the
[19:50] relationship on sinking
[19:52] sand but a doer building on the solid
[19:55] rock a hearer only doesn't have much of
[19:59] a burden for
[20:00] Souls but a doer has a greater burden
[20:03] for
[20:04] Souls a hearer only is pretty much
[20:07] living for
[20:09] himself TR and a doer of the word he's
[20:12] living for others
[20:15] am so that's the John
[20:20] Martin
[20:21] uh here are only do doers
[20:26] list so of but that list could actually
[20:29] be endless I
[20:33] think we all can know whether we're
[20:35] doers of the word right true you don't
[20:38] want to pick what you are
[20:42] doing that's good and you don't want to
[20:44] beat yourself up to what you're not
[20:48] doing what you want to do is are you
[20:51] putting forth the effort to do all the
[20:53] word that's that's that simple amen amen
[20:56] that's a doer of the word but if you're
[20:59] wanting to just not deal with certain
[21:01] things do these
[21:03] things and and and call yourself a
[21:05] Believer you're deceiving your own self
[21:08] James
[21:09] said you have the ability to deceive
[21:13] yourself
[21:15] true you you would stand against anybody
[21:18] that would try to deceive you you'd call
[21:19] them an
[21:23] enemy but then you would Gallop or gulp
[21:27] a thought down that you don't have to do
[21:30] part of the
[21:35] word right now coming to church with
[21:38] little or no intent to change is
[21:41] training yourself for Spiritual
[21:43] deception
[21:45] Amen to actually get to the place that a
[21:48] Believer feels satisfied with just
[21:49] hearing the word and not committed to
[21:52] putting it to practice has been deceived
[21:55] not by the devil but by himself
[21:59] not submitting to the word or intending
[22:01] to allow that word to dictate and to
[22:04] rule over our hearts is on the ladder of
[22:08] spiritual deception
[22:10] amen how many times have we come to
[22:12] church with no intent no
[22:16] intent of making yourself do the
[22:23] word we can't come to church hear the
[22:27] word and because we agree with the word
[22:30] it's it's actually going to just do it
[22:32] for itself in
[22:39] US I'd like to ask this brother if can I
[22:43] you can like correct me if if if you're
[22:45] wrong if I'm wrong if you're
[22:47] wrong I could be wrong
[22:50] here how many times did you hear the
[22:55] word about cutting your hair before you
[22:57] did it
[23:04] okay and the first time that we heard
[23:07] the
[23:09] word did it all a sudden it become
[23:14] materialized you've got to accept it you
[23:16] got to believe it and then you got to
[23:18] put your foot in the
[23:20] water so how many times do we come to
[23:22] church and we hear this word being
[23:24] preached but we don't think about
[23:26] putting our foot in the water that's
[23:28] right
[23:29] we're making ourselves hearers of the
[23:31] word
[23:33] only walking that ladder of deception
[23:36] thank you brother it helps us to
[23:43] see you know how to look at what how we
[23:47] look at certain individuals and we say
[23:49] oh well they're like a spiritual person
[23:51] you know they're they must be a
[23:53] spiritual person look at the way they're
[23:54] acting look at
[23:56] the be because of what James is teaching
[23:59] us we should be able to say and see very
[24:03] clearly who's really walking up the
[24:06] ladder of deception right by simply
[24:09] seeing if they're obeying what they
[24:11] heard last service last week last month
[24:16] right true we get so used to just coming
[24:18] in church and all we got to do is show
[24:20] our religiousness and that's our badge
[24:23] that we're a doer of the word that he's
[24:25] not a doer of the
[24:27] word Merc
[24:28] amen this message
[24:34] exposes you may not want to shake my
[24:37] hand after
[24:44] service verse 23 for If any man be a
[24:47] hearer of the word and not a doer he's
[24:50] like unto a man beholding his natural
[24:54] face in the glass for he beholdeth
[24:56] himself and goeth his way in straight
[24:58] way he forgets what matter of man he
[25:04] was someone who's not following
[25:09] through with the word that he heard at
[25:13] church how many times we come to
[25:16] church and the word speaks to
[25:22] us and we feel a
[25:26] conviction brother sister as we come
[25:28] here to find out where we're at with
[25:30] God and then God shows us we go whoa
[25:32] that ain't good that ain't good we've
[25:36] even heard comments about uh
[25:39] uh uh like like we feel like we got beat
[25:42] up at
[25:46] church but in in any way we feel God
[25:52] showing us where we're at with the word
[25:56] with the message of the hour TR
[25:59] amen we see it clearly as if we're
[26:02] looking in a in a in a in a mirror and
[26:05] say oh man I got a pimple here I got to
[26:07] do something about it that's right but
[26:10] we leave here and we forget what we look
[26:14] like in church what God showed us in
[26:16] church we forget about it
[26:21] right
[26:25] right as long as I keep going to church
[26:27] as long as I keep doing this as long as
[26:29] I keep doing
[26:33] that God would not have showed us what
[26:36] he showed us in church if he didn't have
[26:38] a longing and a desire in his heart for
[26:41] you to
[26:43] change he's expressing his love as many
[26:47] as I love I rebuke and
[26:49] Chason well I thought brother John
[26:51] that's just when you were you know in
[26:53] the in the denomination and you had to
[26:55] repent and get out of that and come into
[26:57] the message I thought after that you
[26:58] don't got to do it no
[27:02] more it's
[27:04] amazing how the enemy can twist
[27:10] things when we're hearing the word
[27:12] preached to us God is speaking and we
[27:15] can see clearly where we're coming short
[27:18] of God's glorious expectation we're
[27:21] saying Amen to the word but I fear that
[27:25] we're leaving services with just a
[27:27] mental agreement with the
[27:30] word in other words we're sitting here
[27:33] naturally with our natural understanding
[27:36] and saying yeah it's
[27:39] true but you
[27:42] know nobody's
[27:45] perfect nobody can do it
[27:48] all well we'll just try to do a little
[27:50] bit better when we
[27:52] leave and we completely forget the
[27:55] personalization of the Holy Ghost
[27:57] speaking to us that's right as
[28:01] individuals Jesus said we straight way
[28:05] or James said we straight way forget
[28:07] what manner of man we was
[28:12] right to come to church and hear the
[28:15] word it's quite
[28:17] easy true honestly it doesn't hurt well
[28:22] we just come and hear what he's got to
[28:23] say he can't hurt you
[28:28] but when we actually have to follow
[28:31] through and do
[28:34] it becomes
[28:38] painful you have to self-inflict pain
[28:43] Affliction right wasn't it John who when
[28:46] he ate the word it was sweet in his
[28:49] mouth it was like honey but when it
[28:51] began to settle in and begin to digest
[28:54] and it had to become part of his life
[28:57] became bitter harder to
[29:01] do Smith Wigglesworth said it right when
[29:04] he said with every
[29:06] Revelation comes the responsibility of
[29:08] carrying it out that's right PA we had
[29:12] to do is say hey man what a great
[29:15] Revelation I got so much Revelation I
[29:17] know all this I know this that and the
[29:20] other and no life no manifestation
[29:24] that's right right no responsibility for
[29:27] Souls
[29:28] that's right that's the or I think we're
[29:32] more of a hearer of the word than a doer
[29:35] amen that's right look when Jesus found
[29:38] they came to Jesus and they brought that
[29:39] woman caught in
[29:41] adultery and they were all trying to
[29:44] catch Jesus is what they were
[29:51] doing and Jesus simply said okay let
[29:55] we're going to do it we're going to do
[29:56] it your way you want to just take that
[29:58] word you want to do it he that's without
[30:00] sin Let Him cast the first
[30:02] stone and noticed it was the eldest
[30:06] right first that laid his Stones down
[30:10] first because he had more sins even
[30:14] though he was a Christian longer he was
[30:16] or more in the message
[30:18] longer he still sin
[30:24] more I don't think I think the more we
[30:27] come to church the more responsible we
[30:30] are to whom much is given much is
[30:36] required why do some people stop going
[30:38] to
[30:40] church that's right it's too much for
[30:44] them many start out the
[30:48] race that's right it's not it is a It's
[30:51] A Hard Road it's it's hard it's not
[30:55] easy that's trth but we don't want to
[30:58] get caught with just being a hearer of
[31:00] the word today a hearer of the message
[31:03] we don't want to just sit and talk about
[31:05] how great certain Ministries are in the
[31:08] message and just
[31:11] hear God can give you a message through
[31:14] a two-letter word
[31:18] am that's trth you could pick up a piece
[31:20] of mail yep see something on there and
[31:23] it be God speaking to
[31:25] you brother random saw that pack of
[31:28] cigarettes right he got the thought
[31:32] about a thinking man's
[31:35] filter God is
[31:37] everywhere we come to God's house to
[31:40] hear from
[31:41] him it's the place we can have
[31:44] confidence
[31:47] in not confidence that we're without
[31:52] sin that we haven't made any mistakes or
[31:55] that we haven't made any really bad
[32:02] mistakes we're Sinners saved by
[32:06] grace if the prophet said we could
[32:09] backslide a 100 times a day back then
[32:12] you know it's got to be worse now
[32:14] because T Paul told Timothy that evil
[32:17] would grow worse and worse
[32:21] right it's terrible terrible
[32:28] I'm telling you it's more than 50/50
[32:29] half the time when you're talking to
[32:31] somebody whether they're gay or
[32:34] lesbian that's the truth brother you
[32:37] don't know why are they talking like
[32:39] that why are they acting like
[32:41] that that just don't look normal John
[32:44] you're judging them I'm not judging them
[32:47] but it's getting worse the statistics
[32:50] are not going the other way it's it's
[32:52] not getting more holy and more righteous
[32:54] and people are coming to you know no
[32:56] they want Church should become you
[32:58] accept me the way I am or you're a
[33:00] racist that's right you're a hater
[33:05] that's the
[33:08] truth we can't sit there blindly and say
[33:10] it don't
[33:12] exist it exists it's getting worse yes
[33:17] sir and just because we're not that we
[33:20] can't sit here in church and just hear
[33:21] the word and not follow through with it
[33:24] because we need that to make a Rapture
[33:26] well you know John going home and having
[33:29] to do that that doesn't seem like it has
[33:30] anything to do with the with the Rapture
[33:32] your obedience to that has everything to
[33:34] do with the
[33:36] Rapture
[33:37] right God knows what he's doing that's
[33:40] the
[33:41] TR can you imagine
[33:44] Gideon go go
[33:46] around with these
[33:51] lanterns and break them and the light
[33:53] come out and walk around Jericho seven
[33:56] times what does this have anything to do
[33:59] with going in there knocking the walls
[34:01] down your obedience to what God
[34:05] says that's what will bring the walls
[34:08] down that's what will make you Triumph
[34:10] and victorious in this leot and age that
[34:13] we're living
[34:17] in I think a lot of times when we're
[34:20] hearing the word being preached we're
[34:22] just hearing naturally We're In the
[34:25] Flesh and we're we're really not hearing
[34:27] spirit spiritually it's not being mixed
[34:29] with faith we're just saying Amen in
[34:33] agreement but not amen by faith so be it
[34:36] in me I don't know how many times I've
[34:39] sat and I've heard people say amen and
[34:42] it's with a
[34:44] pitchfork yeah oh it just hurts me not
[34:48] that it may not be true right but the
[34:53] word when it's coming is personally for
[34:56] you amen
[34:58] we need to make coming to church about
[35:00] you and
[35:02] him God don't need you to Pitchfork it
[35:05] on somebody
[35:06] else he can he can take care of
[35:09] conviction
[35:10] himself amen and when you take the word
[35:14] into yourself you know what you're doing
[35:16] you're creating an atmosphere where God
[35:18] can come and deal with
[35:21] them
[35:23] amen I somewhat fill up preaching this
[35:26] morning Hallelujah Hebrews 4:2 For unto
[35:29] us was the Gospel preached as well as
[35:32] unto them but the word preached did not
[35:35] profit them not being mixed with faith
[35:38] in them that heard it so just sitting
[35:39] here and hearing the word that's
[35:42] important but there's got to be a lot of
[35:46] faith it can't be just a natural Faith a
[35:49] carnal Faith an intellectual Faith the
[35:53] Devils have that and they tremble
[35:55] they're here too you know
[36:01] trth he's here telling you you don't
[36:04] have to listen to
[36:05] him that's not for you that's for
[36:07] somebody
[36:10] else he's here getting your mind on what
[36:12] you're going to do after
[36:16] service he's making you think brother
[36:18] John just being mean to
[36:21] me he's here getting us everywhere than
[36:26] on the word yeah right right
[36:29] true I want to be blessed in my
[36:33] deed the only way I can is to be a doer
[36:35] of the word a hearer of the word only is
[36:39] not a true close follower of Christ
[36:44] remember when Peter followed Jesus from
[36:46] afar he was following him but he
[36:50] couldn't accept the
[36:52] word he got to a place where he's even
[36:55] denying his relationship with Jesus
[36:58] Jesus but Jesus said my sheep hear my
[37:01] voice and they follow me in other
[37:04] words they do what the voice
[37:07] sayith amen my sheep hear my voice and
[37:11] they just do it
[37:14] amen well look don't look at God is the
[37:19] only thing he's going to do is guide you
[37:21] out of some corn maze go here go here go
[37:24] this do this follow me I'll show you the
[37:26] way
[37:28] that's it that's all his job is is to
[37:29] lead and guide
[37:31] me that's
[37:33] truth he's trying to get your life into
[37:36] more truth and more
[37:38] light you actually have to do something
[37:42] true when you hear the voice at church
[37:45] you go out and you do it amen you know
[37:48] what brother Ron my precious brothers
[37:50] and sisters what I love to hear is some
[37:53] testimonies of God leading
[37:56] you and you walking into more
[37:59] truth because that's what the word is
[38:02] for spiritually now
[38:05] naturally is to help you get that new
[38:10] car find out what house you need to be
[38:16] in help figure that one natural thing
[38:20] out right but he has something for you
[38:23] spiritually because those things happen
[38:25] naturally doesn't mean anything's
[38:27] happening the spiritual realm for
[38:29] you and we must learn that the word is
[38:32] to get us to walk in all
[38:37] truth you know it's just like healing
[38:40] healing is a Divine act and power of
[38:45] almighty God and he paid the price for
[38:48] our healing at Calvary
[38:51] yes we could be healed every
[38:55] day and still miss it amen
[38:58] truth and get sick again and die of
[39:01] something so there's an end to those
[39:04] blessings that are in the natural realm
[39:06] Even in our
[39:07] bodies but spiritually see no it's built
[39:11] on a
[39:12] rock it's forever settled in heaven your
[39:16] character brother B say the only thing
[39:18] you're taking with
[39:20] you and we've got to overcome something
[39:23] to gain
[39:25] character so the word spiritual word
[39:28] what makes us a spiritual believer is
[39:30] when we can take the word and we
[39:32] understand that even though it it hurts
[39:34] and and we don't want to do it we know
[39:36] it's the best thing for our souls it's
[39:38] the best thing for our our our character
[39:41] and we're willing to walk into it that's
[39:44] why we come to the house of
[39:46] God well brother John I come for this
[39:48] other reason well I understand that's
[39:50] the bait on the
[39:52] hook that's what brother BR said the
[39:54] healing the bait on the hook attracts
[39:56] the attention
[39:59] attracted the attention of so many
[40:01] ministers they wanted to know brother
[40:02] Bram how do you do it how do you do it
[40:04] why I want about to do that I like to
[40:06] draw that attention to you to you
[40:11] right not even interested getting people
[40:14] of Christ right amen well they don't
[40:17] mind as long as it's through
[40:20] you we're too far down the road
[40:28] this is our
[40:32] relationship we need to get people to
[40:34] him not to us not to look at us not what
[40:38] we did not even what God did through
[40:41] us
[40:47] right Luke chapter 9:23 and he said unto
[40:50] them all if any man will come after me
[40:52] let him deny himself take up his cross
[40:54] daily and follow me so how can how can
[40:59] we just sit and hear the
[41:02] word and be
[41:04] okay we got to deny
[41:07] ourself if that if we don't have faith
[41:10] to mix in I got to deny
[41:12] myself the word won't do us any good we
[41:14] got to take up the cross daily and then
[41:17] follow him that's truly my sheep hear my
[41:19] voice and follow
[41:23] me amen present your body in other words
[41:26] a living
[41:28] sacrifice and then you're
[41:30] following that's the only way you can
[41:35] prove those that hear his voice and do
[41:38] it will be blessed in their deeds those
[41:42] that hear his voice and don't do
[41:45] it are deceiving
[41:49] themselves the the the terrible thing
[41:51] about this is that they don't know
[41:53] it that's what this message is for to
[41:56] bring an awareness of what
[41:59] happens when we're not
[42:02] interested in making sure that the word
[42:04] that we heard is transpiring in our
[42:11] life the Holy Ghost is God speaking
[42:16] directly to
[42:20] you it it happens in
[42:24] here and when God speaks directly to you
[42:28] something needs to take
[42:29] place life needs to come forth brother
[42:32] raham said in the message hear ye him he
[42:34] says when we receive the Holy Ghost it
[42:37] isn't to jump up and
[42:40] down and to shout with right it isn't
[42:43] just to speak with tongues and run all
[42:46] over the floor it isn't to organize a
[42:49] group and say we've got it the rest of
[42:53] you
[42:54] haven't you ever see people who've been
[42:58] blessed by the Holy
[43:01] Spirit and they don't try to include you
[43:04] everywhere amen it's like they're a
[43:08] special
[43:10] badge that's not what the Holy Ghost is
[43:12] for we've got it the rest of you
[43:15] haven't he says it's to work with love
[43:19] and humility as Christ come to do
[43:24] with if you got the Holy Ghost
[43:27] it's to work love and humility inside of
[43:30] you this will all men know you're my
[43:33] disciples you have love one for another
[43:35] what a beautiful quote is
[43:39] it how many is not enjoying this
[43:44] message I want to see if you were
[43:46] listening you just get you don't want to
[43:48] say every Amen to everything you
[43:52] know
[43:54] blessed we can become so relaxed
[43:57] when we rely on the fact that we got the
[43:59] Holy
[44:01] Ghost some people say and feel that
[44:03] they're so full of the Holy Ghost that
[44:05] it doesn't really matter if they attend
[44:07] church every time the doors are
[44:11] open Hebrews chapter 10 verse 24 let us
[44:14] consider one another and to provoke unto
[44:17] love and to good works well what are
[44:19] some of these good works not
[44:21] forsaking the assembling of ourselves
[44:24] together as the matter of some is
[44:29] but exhorting one another and so much
[44:31] more today amen than 20 years ago that's
[44:37] right because we see the day
[44:40] approaching it won't be too much
[44:44] longer we're getting sick of it the
[44:47] bride is getting sick of
[44:49] it there ought to be such a hunger and
[44:53] thirst in our
[44:55] hearts to get here on
[45:00] time brother BR
[45:02] says we got to get to the place if we're
[45:06] really where we need to be we can't wait
[45:09] till the doors are open that's right in
[45:11] other words prior to oh I got to get
[45:14] going it's almost Church time right
[45:16] there's like a hunger and a thirst
[45:20] something's been speaking to you
[45:24] prior you you can't wait to get there
[45:27] now that's why God sent a
[45:31] prophet because we can have confidence
[45:33] in what he
[45:37] said people are losing their
[45:40] fire anybody heard of Grace and
[45:45] Gilbert are you going to hear about him
[45:51] today I'm not going to read everything
[45:53] he said but I'm going to read a
[45:54] portion he said I am under
[45:58] the unw conviction that unless I am
[46:01] genuinely
[46:02] ill people are in their Thor of death my
[46:08] legs are rendered inoperable or we are
[46:12] trapped in our house Church attendance
[46:16] is
[46:17] mandatory he says I will not miss it
[46:20] even when I've had to miss it under
[46:22] those circumstances which is quite rare
[46:25] indeed and I I've hated
[46:28] it however for the sake of being
[46:30] completely
[46:31] transparent there that this was not
[46:33] always the case especially early on in
[46:36] my faith there was a point in my life
[46:39] where I consistently worked on
[46:42] Sundays I was a Christian and had been
[46:45] for a couple of years at that
[46:48] point yet I considered myself to be a
[46:51] faithful Christian who was stuck in
[46:55] between a rock in a hard place I had no
[46:59] other means of income than was bringing
[47:02] into my family at the time and my wife
[47:04] worked but we needed both streams of
[47:07] income to make ends meet and care for
[47:09] the
[47:10] newborn and yet there was a steady
[47:12] growing conviction in my heart that I
[47:15] should be coming to church every single
[47:17] Sunday I believe now that's what I love
[47:20] the Holy Ghost
[47:22] for you don't need to pitch fork bad on
[47:26] somebody
[47:27] right because the Holy Spirit Will
[47:30] convict
[47:31] you and if you don't want
[47:36] conviction he'll say okay because he is
[47:39] a
[47:40] gentleman but if there is a desire to
[47:42] please God in your heart conviction will
[47:45] start coming your
[47:50] way while the argument could be made
[47:53] that it was necessary for me to miss due
[47:55] to the circumstances I found myself in
[47:57] the reality was I needed to swallow my
[47:59] pride and get another job that could
[48:01] allow me to attend church on a weekly
[48:04] basis and just be found faithful to come
[48:07] now notice he was blind he thought he
[48:10] was
[48:13] faithful at some point the conviction
[48:16] came to me that church was a
[48:20] non-negotiable what's more than this is
[48:22] that I came to believe Church attendance
[48:25] is non-negotiable for every
[48:27] Christian I love
[48:30] that in other words this is the
[48:32] conviction that was dealing with me
[48:35] personally I couldn't deny it was the
[48:36] Holy Ghost then I could see in the word
[48:41] it's really for
[48:43] everybody isn't that beautiful and that
[48:46] what's important about that is now you
[48:48] know how to pray for other
[48:51] people the reason this is so is that I
[48:55] believe that the New Testament teach is
[48:57] that our time together as Believers in
[49:00] formal corporate worship is to be one of
[49:03] the most precious things we partake of
[49:05] in as
[49:06] Christians he said I believe that the
[49:09] regular attendance is so important that
[49:11] it reveals our hearts and our
[49:15] priorities it reveals much of what we
[49:17] treasure and likewise much of what we
[49:21] don't it especially reveals what we
[49:24] understand about the person of Christ
[49:27] and his saving work upon the
[49:29] cross right then and there is where I
[49:33] lost several of the
[49:37] readers this is one of those areas where
[49:40] many people have to settle in their
[49:42] minds that church attendance is
[49:47] optional
[49:50] right they can't miss here and there
[49:54] without any large repercussions to their
[49:56] spiritual well-being and their own
[49:58] families will not be any worse off
[50:01] either however the reality is that I
[50:04] have never known a casual attend
[50:07] attendee to thrive in any meaningful
[50:12] capacity in other words if you really
[50:15] want to have love joy peace throughout
[50:17] the
[50:18] week you're not going to ever have that
[50:20] staying out of
[50:24] church that's true
[50:27] that shows that God wants you here now
[50:32] that's Church attendance doesn't
[50:34] automatically give you
[50:37] that but you can't have a casual
[50:40] attitude
[50:42] of and expect that God's happy with
[50:49] that I have witness seasons of growth
[50:52] from then from them I have witnessed
[50:55] seasons of growth from them yet I have
[51:00] simultaneously witnessed a stunt
[51:03] growth because
[51:06] invariably they are
[51:09] sporadically absent from the ordinary
[51:12] means God has given them for their
[51:15] maturity encouragement perseverance in
[51:18] the Christian faith more often than this
[51:21] stunt growth there is no growth at all
[51:23] or worse a backsliding of some
[51:28] sorts tell me you all can witness this
[51:32] you you miss a little bit of church now
[51:34] there's like four pages that was only
[51:36] one I need to go on with the
[51:40] message you've all experience how it
[51:43] feels when you miss some church that's
[51:46] right do you ever feel like I'm thriving
[51:49] more I I need to do this more
[51:53] often now when you've gone on vacation
[51:56] for a couple days few days whatever a
[51:58] week you relax and it does you good
[52:03] right I mean if you're a hard worker
[52:05] when the when the men get back from my
[52:07] from their vacation and they're like
[52:10] refreshed they look good I can say to
[52:13] them if this did you
[52:16] good clear out your
[52:18] mind vacation does good for the
[52:21] body but not for the
[52:24] soul true
[52:27] what is really happening to the person
[52:29] who's sitting in church and is content
[52:31] with just hearing the word having no
[52:33] drive to change no desire to be
[52:35] challenged no will or determination to
[52:38] put the word into
[52:40] action we may feel
[52:42] content but God calls it
[52:45] lukewarm true believers who come and
[52:48] hear the word only but never are hot
[52:52] enough to change our lukewarm yes
[53:00] God doesn't want anything to do with
[53:02] that type of relationship he said I'll
[53:04] spew them out of my
[53:08] mouth they're lukewarm and in need of
[53:11] nothing and they don't feel they need to
[53:13] just do
[53:16] it as long as they
[53:20] agree can you imagine Mary saying to the
[53:23] angel of the Lord you're going to have a
[53:26] child and she just says
[53:29] amen amen mentally
[53:33] amen she wanted it she hungered for it
[53:37] be un to
[53:39] me make it happen in my life yes amen
[53:44] well you know it's a good service I
[53:46] enjoyed it you know I got something out
[53:47] of
[53:49] it true I feel like I know a little bit
[53:52] more now about the
[53:54] subject that's good
[54:01] God's
[54:03] here even when we're not here God's
[54:08] here even when this isn't here God is
[54:13] here we may be here here
[54:17] physically but we need to be here
[54:20] spiritually because God is a spirit they
[54:22] that worship Him must worship Him in
[54:24] spiritual and they that hear must hear
[54:27] in the
[54:36] spirit we don't want to
[54:38] be caught in a lukewarm
[54:45] State maybe not
[54:47] feeling they need to be ready but
[54:49] they're already
[54:52] ready why do they need anything they're
[54:54] they're already ready there's there's
[54:56] there what they're saying is there is
[54:58] it's not really that necessary because
[54:59] I'm ready God loves
[55:00] me it's just a preacher's opinion the
[55:04] things that we wrestle with
[55:07] good I would never say or entertain
[55:10] thoughts that someone wasn't ready I
[55:13] want to make that state
[55:16] meant or in the state of being
[55:20] ready but here's the
[55:24] thing you should never be Act in like
[55:27] you're in need of
[55:30] nothing
[55:32] never I believe that Paul lived in a
[55:35] state of being ready he said I fought a
[55:38] good fight I've kept the faith I'm ready
[55:40] to be offered he lived in a state of
[55:43] being
[55:44] ready Paul worked non-stop for
[55:48] Jesus Paul was steadfast unmovable
[55:51] always abounding in the work of the
[55:53] Lord even though Paul lived in that
[55:56] state of being ready you couldn't tell
[55:59] by his attitude that he was
[56:02] ready true boy there's a revelation in
[56:05] that brother
[56:08] Ron he looked like the the the Christian
[56:11] that just came
[56:12] in hungering thirsting I need more of
[56:17] God his attitude was the same as if he
[56:20] wasn't
[56:23] ready what a paradox
[56:26] good brother bam said in the message
[56:28] desperation he says now remember he said
[56:30] keep the token
[56:32] applied and be desperate to press into
[56:34] the kingdom amen that to me is the state
[56:37] of being ready
[56:39] amen
[56:42] now done I'm done I'm
[56:47] there and don't you cross me
[56:51] either because I'll show you right
[56:54] quick that you're not
[56:58] ready Philippians 3:12 we need to hurry
[57:01] because we're only
[57:06] halfway that was just the the foundation
[57:08] you know the problems I have with the
[57:13] foundations all right Philippians
[57:14] chapter 3:12 not as though I've already
[57:17] attained either we're already perfect
[57:21] but I follow after if that I may
[57:24] apprehend that for which also I'm
[57:26] apprehended of Jesus Christ Brethren I
[57:28] count not myself to have
[57:30] apprehended but this one thing do I'm
[57:32] forgetting all my
[57:35] achievements and I'm reaching forth for
[57:38] something
[57:41] more we want to take that scripture and
[57:43] apply it to all the bad things we've
[57:45] done Paul's whole topic is talking about
[57:48] getting
[57:49] somewhere yeah obviously we can't get
[57:53] anywhere if we're so down and upset and
[57:56] bother because of something we did in
[57:57] the past right yeah we need to forget
[58:02] that but the real problem is there's so
[58:07] much
[58:08] pride that's
[58:12] true just accept what you
[58:15] did realize that without Christ we're
[58:19] just beast that's we're just Beast I'm a
[58:24] little bit better beast than you Brother
[58:25] John
[58:26] okay but you're still
[58:29] Beast we must as just accept
[58:37] it I press towards the mark for the real
[58:42] prize not just salvation I'm saved I
[58:45] don't need to press anymore repented got
[58:48] baptized in the message I'm a good
[58:50] Christian Stand Out stand up people look
[58:53] at me they look up to me
[59:00] I'm saved what are the prizes are I got
[59:04] Jesus Christ in my
[59:06] life that is such a carnal natural
[59:17] understanding the High Calling of God in
[59:20] Christ
[59:23] Jesus I like that one Psalm that the
[59:26] fontain sing until I see all of him in
[59:31] me and there's many times at the course
[59:34] of the day I don't see him in me say
[59:36] what are you doing that for what are you
[59:37] thinking that what
[59:40] what I have reason depress amen
[59:43] therefore let us therefore as many as be
[59:46] perfect how many's perfect
[59:48] here come
[59:50] on let me just say this to you you act
[59:53] like it sometimes
[59:58] true the way that you talk negatively
[1:00:02] down or condenscending or
[1:00:14] judging but let's just say for a moment
[1:00:16] you
[1:00:19] were let us therefore as many as be
[1:00:22] perfect be thus minded have the same
[1:00:25] mind
[1:00:27] as if you weren't perfect right that's
[1:00:30] what he's saying here and if anything ye
[1:00:33] be otherwise minded God shall convict
[1:00:37] your
[1:00:39] heart he'll let you
[1:00:46] know this is so it's okay to not be
[1:00:51] perfect it's not okay to have an
[1:00:54] attitude
[1:00:56] that I am
[1:00:58] perfect see where it gets
[1:01:02] you I don't need to work out my
[1:01:04] salvation anymore fear and trembling I'm
[1:01:06] already
[1:01:07] saved well what do you do with he that
[1:01:09] endureth to the end well I don't know
[1:01:12] not for me start ripping out part of the
[1:01:14] Bible and you will not see the picture
[1:01:20] clear
[1:01:21] nevertheless where un you have already
[1:01:24] attained let us walk by the same Rule
[1:01:27] and let us mind the same thing in other
[1:01:29] words live the same way as if you didn't
[1:01:33] attain that makes for a very
[1:01:37] humble
[1:01:38] heart Brethren be followers together of
[1:01:41] me and mark them which walk so as ye
[1:01:45] have us for an
[1:01:48] example look there is other believers
[1:01:50] out there who are only interested in
[1:01:53] themselves they feel like they've
[1:01:55] apprehended
[1:01:58] you
[1:01:59] haven't they're in a state that they're
[1:02:02] Superior over you they've
[1:02:05] attained and Paul's saying don't look at
[1:02:08] them as your example look at look he
[1:02:11] said first he said look at me and
[1:02:13] there's others out there that have the
[1:02:14] same attitude that I'm talking about let
[1:02:16] them be your example he says for many
[1:02:19] walk of whom I have told you often and
[1:02:22] now telling you weeping that they're the
[1:02:24] enemies of the cross
[1:02:26] when you don't have this attitude you're
[1:02:29] an enemy of the Cross even though you
[1:02:33] claim whose end is destruction whose God
[1:02:36] is their belly in other words it's all
[1:02:38] about them it's all about them whose
[1:02:41] glory is their shame and who mind
[1:02:43] Earthly
[1:02:46] things brother brandham
[1:02:50] said you'll never leave the service the
[1:02:54] same now many times we've walked out the
[1:02:57] door feeling the same oh let me say it
[1:03:00] like this we've walked out the door
[1:03:01] feeling like nothing
[1:03:03] happened but brother Brandon makes it
[1:03:05] clear you'll never leave the service the
[1:03:08] same as when you
[1:03:10] came because a decision is always being
[1:03:13] made when the word is given to
[1:03:17] you and your attitude or your decision
[1:03:21] that you make with that will determine
[1:03:25] your spiritual walk with
[1:03:31] God we will either
[1:03:33] become more humble dig in I've got to
[1:03:38] know you more I've got to I got to have
[1:03:41] manifested what you just told me I won't
[1:03:43] rest until I get it I'm going to spend
[1:03:45] time praying about it talking about it I
[1:03:47] want it to be part of my
[1:03:49] life
[1:03:51] or you'll become more
[1:03:53] knowledgeable right more
[1:03:58] intellect and more
[1:04:01] religious because somehow you've got to
[1:04:04] act like it even if you don't got it
[1:04:06] yeah
[1:04:08] right you one goes negative away from
[1:04:14] God one goes towards
[1:04:17] god with every single
[1:04:22] service there's a decision that's being
[1:04:25] made verse 25 our opening scripture but
[1:04:27] who so lookth in the perfect law of
[1:04:30] Liberty and continueth therein be not a
[1:04:34] forgetful hearer but a doer of the work
[1:04:37] this man shall be blessed in his
[1:04:40] deed now I just want to spend just a
[1:04:42] couple minutes if I could talking about
[1:04:45] being blessed because you heard a pretty
[1:04:48] strong
[1:04:51] message Jesus said if you continue in my
[1:04:54] word then you're my disciples and deed
[1:04:56] in other words if you don't continue to
[1:04:59] do what you've heard God is not going to
[1:05:02] claim you as his
[1:05:04] disciple it's the doer of the work that
[1:05:07] shall be
[1:05:08] blessed I say when the word is being
[1:05:11] preached just go do
[1:05:13] it don't rationalize it right don't look
[1:05:17] for ways not to have to do it be a doer
[1:05:22] of the word work the word in your life
[1:05:26] believe it act on it pray about it talk
[1:05:30] about it and and start to put your foot
[1:05:32] in the water fall over it doesn't matter
[1:05:35] start practicing it am God's looking for
[1:05:39] the attitude of I care about living the
[1:05:44] word you're going to be blessed in your
[1:05:47] deed the word will be materialized
[1:05:50] eventually in your life a few quotes
[1:05:52] from Brother brand in the message
[1:05:54] expectation brother BR says say now
[1:05:56] Jesus said I'll tell you these quotes
[1:05:58] that I'm
[1:05:59] reading they were all when I did the
[1:06:03] study on the on being
[1:06:07] ready and I just it just God just came
[1:06:11] right around and said they this word is
[1:06:14] for
[1:06:16] them so God doesn't
[1:06:18] forget and and and and just maybe it
[1:06:21] just wasn't time we trust
[1:06:24] that now Jesus said I give them eternal
[1:06:27] life eternal the word comes from the
[1:06:30] word Zoe the Greek word which means the
[1:06:32] life of God well then if we have the
[1:06:35] life of God in us the born again then we
[1:06:39] have God's life in us which makes us
[1:06:42] believe like God
[1:06:44] does and whatever the word says it will
[1:06:50] materialize do you see what I'm saying
[1:06:53] if we're truly believing what we're
[1:06:54] hearing right it will be happening out
[1:06:59] there in the message at Thy word brother
[1:07:01] R says that's it take the word of God
[1:07:04] and God's spoken word must materialize
[1:07:07] and produce exactly what it says it will
[1:07:10] listen the right mental attitude towards
[1:07:13] any Divine promise of God will bring it
[1:07:15] the past I don't care what it is if you
[1:07:18] want corn you plant corn water corn and
[1:07:21] leave corn alone it will produce corn
[1:07:26] is that right wheat will produce wheat
[1:07:29] in the message what think you of Christ
[1:07:32] brother B says and if the right mental
[1:07:36] attitude and and if the right mental
[1:07:38] attitude you just take the right mental
[1:07:40] attitude towards any Divine promise of
[1:07:42] God and he said watch it
[1:07:45] materialize of course you're going to be
[1:07:47] tried s the devil's going to come to you
[1:07:49] and say you don't believe that look you
[1:07:51] fell you went three days and you didn't
[1:07:53] even think about it yeah
[1:07:57] yes you're going to have a battle but
[1:07:59] you get right back up and you say yes
[1:08:01] but the Lord brought it to my attention
[1:08:03] amen praise the Lord look how long Mary
[1:08:08] and and Joseph went didn't realize Jesus
[1:08:10] with with them he didn't say oh I give
[1:08:13] up no I went back looking for
[1:08:18] him in the message questions and answers
[1:08:22] the question was given please explain
[1:08:23] the mystery of the translation of the
[1:08:25] Bride
[1:08:26] brother Bram said this first conscious
[1:08:28] controls this body with see taste feel
[1:08:31] smell and hear and has just got us all
[1:08:34] scrupled up we reason and everything
[1:08:37] else but the new body that comes from
[1:08:40] the born again not the first conscious
[1:08:43] that passes away but inside something
[1:08:45] lives everybody understand that say amen
[1:08:48] amen I don't completely understand it
[1:08:50] but I'm going to say
[1:08:51] Amen it's not the outside see taste feel
[1:08:55] smile and hear it isn't it's subject to
[1:08:58] death and we will die but inside part of
[1:09:01] you down here inside the person that
[1:09:06] cannot
[1:09:09] die and that's the person that has the
[1:09:12] new life that starts from the new birth
[1:09:15] and it builds another person in the
[1:09:17] image of this person you are around that
[1:09:22] life you get it so God is in here he's
[1:09:26] not going to stay there in a
[1:09:29] shell he wants to come out he wants to
[1:09:32] manifest
[1:09:35] again that's why the word needs to
[1:09:37] become important to us when we leave
[1:09:39] here that we
[1:09:43] heard the God in heaven if I could say
[1:09:46] it like this is speaking to the god
[1:09:49] inside of his
[1:09:51] bride he's expressing his desire from
[1:09:54] Heaven to man EST in his
[1:09:56] bride we say Amen to that and we leave
[1:10:00] here doing
[1:10:02] it and understand you just can't go live
[1:10:05] it on your own but you begin by wanting
[1:10:08] it being serious Being Sober praying
[1:10:10] about it Lord I believe your word and
[1:10:12] you're
[1:10:13] trying not well you know it's too hard I
[1:10:16] don't feel good don't got
[1:10:23] time so potent eventually it's here and
[1:10:26] what is it the word promised before the
[1:10:28] foundation of the
[1:10:29] world and around there this only
[1:10:33] reflects the negative that will reflect
[1:10:36] the positive the word and the thing is
[1:10:39] the translation of the Bride will be the
[1:10:41] same way the word that's in you the word
[1:10:45] that you've
[1:10:46] accepted not just
[1:10:49] heard because when you hear it only you
[1:10:51] don't accept it spiritually
[1:10:55] he said the word that's in you the body
[1:10:58] will materialize around the word word
[1:11:01] the same as it did by
[1:11:05] Sarah we have every right to believe the
[1:11:08] word that we heard on Sunday is going to
[1:11:11] become part of our
[1:11:14] life it will
[1:11:17] materialize it will materialize in your
[1:11:22] life but if we hear only
[1:11:28] if we come with that habit of just
[1:11:31] making it to church and hearing the word
[1:11:34] but we don't come with I want to live
[1:11:36] whatever God speaks to me I can't wait
[1:11:38] to what it
[1:11:39] is yes it won't be easy for the flesh
[1:11:42] this gospel is not for your
[1:11:46] flesh flesh and blood won't inherit the
[1:11:49] Kingdom we want to live with him right
[1:11:50] in heaven so somewhere down the line we
[1:11:53] got to be mature enough to to knock out
[1:11:55] the Flesh and be interested in what's
[1:11:58] happening in our nature amen let's Stand
[1:12:01] Together God bless you for your your
[1:12:06] patience you see why I couldn't read
[1:12:08] those other three
[1:12:13] pages amen can we sing we're standing on
[1:12:16] Holy Ground okay praise the Lord
[1:12:30] [Music]
[1:12:36] amen
[1:12:38] Unholy
[1:12:42] ground and I
[1:12:45] know that there are
[1:12:49] angels all around

[1:33:46] Wednesday prayer meeting Wednesday's
[1:33:48] prayer me how many's excited man we
[1:33:51] can't pray enough brother brah said do
[1:33:53] anything too much can't pray too
[1:33:55] much and uh it is something to help us
[1:33:58] get
[1:34:00] back in the closeness with the
[1:34:03] Lord and uh remember it's not praying In
[1:34:06] the
[1:34:07] Flesh the Bible says pray always in the
[1:34:11] spirit if someone's going to pray for
[1:34:14] me I want to be in the spirit amen
[1:34:17] supplications in the spirit because the
[1:34:19] the effectual fervent prayer of a
[1:34:21] righteous man availeth much amen
[1:34:25] um I believe this would be a good time
[1:34:27] since the Lord brought it to my my
[1:34:30] attention um I want us to especially
[1:34:34] remember our brother Ron
[1:34:39] Husker
[1:34:41] um he had told me some time ago that he
[1:34:44] he's has the uh
[1:34:47] later stages of postate prostate
[1:34:51] cancer and uh
[1:34:54] and the numbers are rising they're
[1:34:56] doubling and it's it's not a good sign
[1:35:01] scientifically it's not going in the
[1:35:03] right
[1:35:05] direction um and he honestly had no
[1:35:10] intentions of sharing anything but I
[1:35:12] asked for permission I asked for his
[1:35:14] permission after a couple
[1:35:17] weeks because I believe in the prayers
[1:35:20] of the Saints I believe in your prayers
[1:35:23] we may not be the
[1:35:25] biggest we may not be the
[1:35:28] baddest the
[1:35:31] boldest the best
[1:35:34] anything but we're part of his
[1:35:36] bride amen and I believe that the
[1:35:40] bridegroom hears the cries of his wife
[1:35:45] amen God he's able to do exceedingly
[1:35:49] above yes sir whatever we ask whatever
[1:35:52] we can think and I know it seems like a
[1:35:54] hard situation but we have
[1:35:56] testimonies amen God is the same
[1:35:59] yesterday today and
[1:36:01] forever and I I just it we may not be
[1:36:05] mentioned a lot but engrave it in your
[1:36:08] heart to remember our brother in
[1:36:11] prayer um the reason we don't want to
[1:36:13] mention a lot is our brother don't want
[1:36:14] to draw attention to himself just a real
[1:36:17] humble
[1:36:19] Spirit um but if it's here the burden's
[1:36:24] there you know that's what to get the
[1:36:26] job done and brother Ron before we
[1:36:30] dismiss and pray just did did I is there
[1:36:33] anything that you want to add to what I
[1:36:35] said or to to correct what I said
[1:36:54] amen for that
[1:36:57] year
[1:37:01] amen it's a it's
[1:37:03] real it's it's
[1:37:06] real
[1:37:08] um I just I love to see God
[1:37:15] move he's the same yesterday forever I I
[1:37:19] don't I don't want us to think like the
[1:37:22] doctors I I uh I understand that's what
[1:37:27] they're saying and it's it's it's
[1:37:29] statistically there's things that they
[1:37:32] reasons they say
[1:37:34] that um
[1:37:37] but let's believe that God would move in
[1:37:41] his
[1:37:42] behalf amen that's right brother Mike
[1:37:45] praise the Lord he can do it let's
[1:37:48] believe he will do it let's pray for it
[1:37:51] on Wednesdays let's pray for all the
[1:37:54] time that the Lord would bring to your
[1:37:55] thoughts our our our our precious
[1:37:57] brother our brother drives a couple
[1:38:00] hours one
[1:38:02] way and uh he was starting to come on
[1:38:06] Wednesdays yes I
[1:38:09] said whoa let's not overdo
[1:38:12] this I don't want
[1:38:14] to he's not used to driving out and here
[1:38:18] he is he's wanting to praise God with
[1:38:20] everything he has while the time he has
[1:38:25] and uh I think God sees his heart to be
[1:38:28] here on Wednesdays even when he's not
[1:38:31] here is that that that
[1:38:33] desire amen God sees when we can't be
[1:38:38] here amen yes brother
[1:38:41] R you know in saying what you're saying
[1:38:44] know I believe that we all believe
[1:38:49] that we're the one who makes difference
[1:38:55] we
[1:39:09] know we are a body we
[1:39:13] should amen we should have
[1:39:19] re yes
[1:39:23] amen that's perfect it's it's like
[1:39:28] um it's like we need a
[1:39:31] responsibility take on the
[1:39:34] responsibility of
[1:39:36] intercession and it's it's not just for
[1:39:38] somebody
[1:39:39] else let's say collectively nor many
[1:39:43] people we got here and there's people
[1:39:44] listening just say there's a a total of
[1:39:46] maybe 40
[1:39:49] people that are are combining in this
[1:39:53] effort to pray for a brother and
[1:39:56] everybody has one 140th of a part to
[1:40:00] play all you got to do is play your one
[1:40:03] part yeah but you think oh there's 39
[1:40:06] certainly that'll get the job
[1:40:07] done I'm
[1:40:10] not I'm sure you know they'll handle it
[1:40:14] and it misses out because we didn't play
[1:40:16] our part and that's I think what our
[1:40:17] brother's trying to say we have a part
[1:40:19] to play and we want to make sure we play
[1:40:22] our part amen
[1:40:24] amen well the Lord be with you and bless
[1:40:26] you amen we're be in dism dismissed in
