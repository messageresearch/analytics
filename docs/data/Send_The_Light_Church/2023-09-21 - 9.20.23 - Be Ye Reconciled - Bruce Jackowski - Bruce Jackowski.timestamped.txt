[31:55] we have
[31:57] uh
[31:58] two scriptures readings
[32:01] tonight amen so
[32:04] II Corinthians 5 and then we'll go to
[32:06] Romans 5. amen
[32:10] second Corinthians 5 starting in verse
[32:12] 17.
[32:14] therefore If any man be in Christ he is
[32:17] a new creature old things are passed
[32:20] away behold all things are become new
[32:24] and all things are of God who hath
[32:27] reconciled us to himself by Jesus Christ
[32:29] and has given to us the ministry of
[32:32] reconciliation
[32:34] to wit that God was in Christ
[32:37] reconciling the world unto himself not
[32:40] imputing their trespasses unto them and
[32:43] hath committed unto us the word of
[32:45] reconciliation
[32:46] now then we are ambassadors for Christ
[32:49] as though God did beseech You by us we
[32:52] pray you in Christ stead be ye
[32:55] reconciled to God for he hath made him
[32:59] to be sin for us who knew no sin that he
[33:03] might be made that we might be made the
[33:05] righteousness of God in him
[33:08] amen and if you turn over to Romans 5
[33:13] Romans 5 verse 10.
[33:16] it says so if for if when we were
[33:20] enemies we were reconciled to God by the
[33:23] death of his son much more being
[33:25] reconciled we shall be saved by his life
[33:29] and not only so but we also join God
[33:32] through our Lord Jesus Christ by whom we
[33:36] have now received the atonement amen
[33:40] as far hits for word of prayer dear Lord
[33:43] we're grateful father Lord that that we
[33:46] can gather together father
[33:49] Lord we can read your word but it it
[33:53] takes a holy spirit to come father to
[33:56] anoint the vessel and anoint your word
[33:58] anoint the hearers lord lord Jesus open
[34:01] our eyes father I pray that when we go
[34:04] we can say did not our hearts burn
[34:07] within us as he spoke to us Lord I pray
[34:10] you'll speak to each and every one of us
[34:11] we love you Lord we thank you for all
[34:14] these things in Jesus Christ's name we
[34:16] ask it amen amen you may be seated amen
[34:22] so
[34:25] just go back to Second Corinthians
[34:27] because that's where we'll start
[34:31] we're going to take a text here
[34:34] out of
[34:36] um
[34:38] oh I lost it
[34:49] out of verse 20.
[34:51] be ye reconciled to God
[34:59] brother Branham said so now many people
[35:01] can open up this word like this but it
[35:03] takes the Holy Spirit to interpret the
[35:05] word don't you think so
[35:08] you see we can pull back the pages but
[35:11] it takes God the Holy Spirit to reveal
[35:13] it the Bible it's a mysterious Hidden
[35:16] book and there's no need of trying to
[35:18] learn it by education and it doesn't
[35:19] come that way the Bible plainly says God
[35:22] said I have hid it from the eyes of the
[35:24] wise and The Prudent and we reveal it to
[35:27] babes such as we'll learn
[35:29] so the Bible's not a western book it's
[35:31] an Eastern book and a few trips across
[35:34] the sea will let you become more
[35:35] acquainted with the customs of the Bible
[35:37] and the things and then it becomes a new
[35:39] book to you when you once live with the
[35:42] Jewish people and where the Bible was
[35:44] written and in the Oriental types now
[35:46] most of us we can't just quit our jobs
[35:50] and sell our house and go live in Judea
[35:54] for six months and learn the customs of
[35:56] the Jewish people and then go over into
[35:59] India and learn the customs of the
[36:00] people over there so I appreciate that
[36:03] brother Branham says we'll never
[36:06] understand it until we go and live and
[36:08] learn but we don't have that opportunity
[36:10] but the key to that whole scripture is
[36:13] it takes the Holy Spirit Lord to
[36:16] interpret the word it takes that's what
[36:19] it takes amen
[36:20] so in Jehovah Jireh brother Branham says
[36:23] so now that may seem strange to just a
[36:26] mind that has never studied the Oriental
[36:28] Customs we have so many Customs we have
[36:30] so many things the Bible was written as
[36:33] an Eastern book for an Eastern people
[36:35] and we are our Western people trying to
[36:38] put a western interpretation to an
[36:41] Eastern book
[36:43] amen
[36:44] so just to show you an example of that
[36:46] brother Branham says but look he says a
[36:49] person that's got unconfessed sin or
[36:51] something in their heart you could pray
[36:53] for them all night long and they'll
[36:55] never do any good that demon will hold
[36:57] right there or if that person was
[36:59] supposed to do something that didn't do
[37:02] it and God put that disease on them to
[37:04] bring them to to reconciliation or to
[37:07] correction you just can't do it so we
[37:10] see where brother Bynum took
[37:11] reconciliation and he intertwined it and
[37:14] replaced it with correction
[37:17] that these two completely different
[37:19] English words in that just in that quote
[37:22] he shows that he's using them
[37:24] interchangeably
[37:25] so I want to take a look tonight to be
[37:29] reconciled amen
[37:32] so in second Corinthians 5 we're just
[37:34] going to start in second Corinthians 5
[37:36] 17 it says so therefore If any man be in
[37:40] Christ he is a new creature he's a new
[37:43] creature old things are passed away and
[37:46] behold all things are become new
[37:48] that's a good place to be that's a
[37:51] really good place because the old ways
[37:54] when you become into Christ then the old
[37:59] things that you used to do they no
[38:01] longer have a hold on you anymore you
[38:03] know you used to go run with this
[38:05] certain crowd of people and he used to
[38:06] you know you'd get out of work and maybe
[38:08] we're gonna go to the bar we're gonna
[38:10] have a drink and and then we're gonna
[38:12] laugh and complain about our boss and
[38:15] our job and then we'll go home and
[38:16] everything else but when you come into
[38:18] Christ those things old things are
[38:22] passed away All Things become new the
[38:24] way you dress it becomes new the way you
[38:26] act it becomes new your old habits your
[38:30] old language your old your old
[38:33] everything it's all new amen and and
[38:36] that's a good place to be
[38:38] amen but he asked that question he says
[38:41] if any man be in Christ and you'll
[38:45] notice that Romans 5
[38:47] starts out with the same question if
[38:51] so in verse 18 He says and all things
[38:53] are of God
[38:55] so whether it's a trial or whether it's
[38:58] a blessing or or whether it is God is in
[39:02] everything amen
[39:04] God is in everything all things are of
[39:06] God who hath reconciled us to himself by
[39:10] Jesus Christ and has given to us the
[39:13] ministry of reconciliation
[39:16] now
[39:17] we take
[39:18] those two words
[39:21] and and we see reconciled and that's in
[39:26] the past tense and we see reconciliation
[39:29] which has got the same word but it's a
[39:33] process and we assume that those two
[39:36] words are the same word like they would
[39:38] be in the English language but they're
[39:40] not
[39:41] in the English language when we talk
[39:44] about reconciliation or to reconcile
[39:47] something normally it's used in
[39:50] accounting
[39:51] um in the English dictionary it says to
[39:54] bring into harmony
[39:56] amen so we find out you know when when I
[40:00] get a bill a bill will come in the mail
[40:02] and and I'll open it up and now I look
[40:06] at it and it says oh this is the light
[40:08] bill and I owe a hundred dollars and
[40:10] then I go to the bank and I get a
[40:14] hundred dollars and I go and I pay that
[40:17] bill and now once I've paid that bill
[40:20] then it's reconciled
[40:23] and it's no longer owed but next month
[40:26] it comes again
[40:28] and then I have to pay it again if the
[40:30] debt goes up I have to pay more if it
[40:33] goes down I get to pay less but that's
[40:35] the way we see reconciled
[40:38] um
[40:39] you might want to leave that scripture
[40:41] up there
[40:44] so so when we look at these two words
[40:48] we think of it as a certain way we think
[40:50] of of
[40:51] um it being
[40:53] something that's going to to bring us
[40:55] into harmony with God but when Paul when
[41:00] Paul you know see the thing about
[41:02] Corinthians the Corinthian Church it it
[41:06] was um it was the most
[41:09] uneducated Church
[41:11] they had Church order issues they had
[41:13] problems they had to you know Paul had
[41:16] to explain everything to them and and
[41:18] try to teach them and and bring them
[41:20] into Harmony and that and he wrote this
[41:22] to them and he wrote this to them you
[41:25] know Corinth is over by turkey it's over
[41:28] in Asia Minor and that's what brother
[41:30] Branham said it's an Eastern book so we
[41:33] need to take a look so reconciled now
[41:36] um
[41:38] you got you got my first uh
[41:41] I gave this
[41:43] so reconciled
[41:46] is this Greek word I'm not even going to
[41:48] try to pronounce it it's only used six
[41:51] times in the in the New Testament
[41:53] and it means to change mutually that is
[41:57] figuratively to compound a difference
[42:00] and you'll notice that in this
[42:02] particular word
[42:04] it says to change mutually and that
[42:07] means you have to be in agreement
[42:09] so you know when two people come
[42:10] together and whether they're making a
[42:12] business deal or they're making a simple
[42:14] deal like hey what are we having for
[42:16] dinner tonight Donna has to be in
[42:18] mutually agreement with me or I have to
[42:20] get in agreement with her white Crick
[42:22] right and then so because this this says
[42:28] it's a change mutually then it takes two
[42:31] people to make it
[42:33] and it also that is figuratively a
[42:36] compound of a difference and you can't
[42:39] have compound with one
[42:41] a compound is two or more and they have
[42:45] to come together
[42:46] so now let's uh go back to verse 17.
[42:53] uh sorry 18.
[42:57] so he says all things are of God who
[43:00] hath reconciled us
[43:02] see there's two people
[43:04] and we have to be in mutual agreement
[43:06] with God to be reconciled to Jesus
[43:10] Christ
[43:12] so there's two things happening there
[43:14] one is we have
[43:17] we have a debt
[43:19] and there's somebody else is coming
[43:22] along to pay the debt we've seen that
[43:23] song I owed a debt that I could not pay
[43:26] He Paid a Debt he did not owe
[43:28] so so he says all things are of God who
[43:32] hath reconciled us to himself by Jesus
[43:36] Christ which is compound and have given
[43:39] to us the ministry of reconciliation so
[43:41] now that's the interpret the second
[43:44] slide that I gave you sister Amanda
[43:47] so this is a different word
[43:51] it's only used four times in the New
[43:53] Testament
[43:55] and it means to exchange
[43:58] an exchange
[44:01] that is restoration to a Divine favor
[44:05] I'm going to give something and I'm
[44:09] going to be restored to Divine favor
[44:12] which is going to create an atonement
[44:15] because without an atonement you can't
[44:18] you have Divine favor
[44:20] amen
[44:21] so go back to the scripture uh verse 18.
[44:25] so all things are of God who hath
[44:28] reconciled us see the compound
[44:31] to himself by Jesus Christ and it's
[44:33] given us to us the ministry of
[44:35] reconciliation or an exchange
[44:38] there is no agreement there it's
[44:40] something I'm going to give and God's
[44:43] going to do something for me amen amen
[44:47] so verse 19 says
[44:50] to wit that God was in Christ
[44:53] reconciling the world unto himself
[44:57] and that's the first interpretation
[44:59] that first word again reconciling the
[45:01] world unto himself not imputing their
[45:04] trespasses unto them
[45:07] I thought it was really interesting that
[45:09] when I looked at that I said
[45:11] the world is lost
[45:14] but God in Christ he came together with
[45:19] them made an agreement with the world
[45:22] and he's not holding them accountable
[45:25] for their trespasses
[45:28] he's not holding them accountable for it
[45:31] that's what it says
[45:33] and hath committed unto us the word of
[45:36] reconciliation so this is that second
[45:38] word again where he says unto us the
[45:42] word of an exchange
[45:45] as we go farther into this
[45:48] you'll like it I promise
[45:52] verse 20.
[45:54] so now then we are ambassadors for
[45:57] Christ as though God did beseech You by
[46:00] us we pray you in Christ stead be ye
[46:03] reconciled to God
[46:05] that word there reconciled is the
[46:08] exchange word
[46:12] the same word that the they interpreted
[46:15] as reconciliation it's the exchanged
[46:17] word
[46:18] and what I like is that in the original
[46:22] it says
[46:24] on behalf of Christ therefore we are
[46:27] ambassadors as if God were inviting
[46:31] through us we entreat on behalf of
[46:34] Christ
[46:35] now I'm going to entreat because if I'm
[46:39] an ambassador I'm somebody who's a
[46:42] representative from a country and all of
[46:45] the government is on my shoulders so
[46:47] we're an ambassador for Christ
[46:49] and we entreat others to be reconciled
[46:54] to God but we need to be reconciled to
[46:58] God Amen
[46:59] amen praise the Lord
[47:04] yes
[47:10] so then verse 21 says for he hath made
[47:14] him
[47:16] to be sin for us who knew no sin that we
[47:19] might be made the righteousness of God
[47:21] in him
[47:23] brother Brennan said he said in the
[47:24] Paradox he said he had to become that
[47:28] he had to become sin to die to satisfy
[47:31] his own laws of righteousness he
[47:34] predicted and said the day that you eat
[47:36] thereof that day you shall die and he
[47:38] had to fulfill there was nobody else
[47:41] could do it but himself
[47:44] amen amen so let's go to Romans 5.
[47:48] so we find out that Paul when he was
[47:51] right into the Corinthians he's you know
[47:54] we started out he says therefore If any
[47:57] man be in Christ he's a new creature
[48:00] and Romans 5
[48:02] and verse 10
[48:04] he says for if
[48:07] when we were enemies we were reconciled
[48:10] to God by the death of his son much more
[48:14] being reconciled we shall be saved by
[48:17] his life amen
[48:20] that word there being reconciled both of
[48:23] those words in that scripture
[48:25] are the ones where it is
[48:28] an exchange
[48:32] there was no mutual agreement it was an
[48:34] exchange
[48:36] amen
[48:42] we shall be saved by his life and not
[48:44] only so but we also joy in God through
[48:48] our Lord Jesus Christ by whom we have
[48:50] now received the atonement
[48:53] and that word atonement is the Greek
[48:56] word for reconciliation
[48:58] it's the same word amen foreign
[49:03] so when you look at the Bible you don't
[49:06] so the thing is is that we
[49:08] brother random said well we can't learn
[49:11] it by education
[49:13] we have to have the Holy Spirit come
[49:15] down and show us
[49:17] the other morning
[49:19] I was I was up and after I said my
[49:21] prayers and that I normally the first
[49:23] thing I do is is I open up lifeline and
[49:25] I read the quote for the day and I read
[49:27] the quote and and the scripture that
[49:30] they had underneath it was Romans 5 10.
[49:33] and and I started reading that and
[49:37] reading verse 11 and then
[49:39] it just seemed like
[49:41] the Lord came and
[49:44] started speaking to me
[49:48] so so we see
[49:51] what we see is that
[49:54] these two words are not the same
[49:58] as you having a debt
[50:00] and you having to pay that debt
[50:04] it's not the same
[50:07] so let's go and take a look if you're
[50:10] going to know these things then you have
[50:12] to go back to the beginning so let's go
[50:14] to Genesis 3.
[50:17] amen
[50:24] Genesis 3 we know is the fall
[50:27] and in Genesis 3 15
[50:31] now look the Lord has already spoken to
[50:36] Adam and he's spoken to The Serpent and
[50:40] now he's still speaking to the serpent
[50:42] and he says I will put enmity between
[50:45] thee and the woman and between thy seed
[50:48] and her seed and it shall bruise thy
[50:51] head and thou shalt bruise his heel and
[50:53] that word enmity means hostility or
[50:56] hatred
[50:58] it also means you'll see that that
[51:01] brother Branham also said it's it's like
[51:03] a great big wall
[51:06] he said it was a chasm
[51:08] you know after the curse God cursed the
[51:11] serpent so the Serpent's Seed could
[51:14] never mingle again with the human seed
[51:17] there was a Chasm made so great that it
[51:21] could never cross ever again
[51:24] amen
[51:25] amen
[51:27] and then down in verse 22 just to save
[51:30] some time
[51:31] down in verse 22 says and the Lord God
[51:33] said behold the man has become as one of
[51:37] us to know good and evil and now lest he
[51:40] put forth his hand and take also of the
[51:42] tree of life and eat and live forever
[51:45] therefore the Lord God sent him forth
[51:48] from the Garden of Eden
[51:50] we know that God at the beginning before
[51:55] he created the heavens of the earth
[51:56] before he created Adam and Eve that he
[51:58] was alone with his thoughts and his
[52:01] thoughts were his attributes but one of
[52:04] the things that had never been
[52:06] displayed to Adam or to his creation was
[52:11] God's hatred
[52:14] God had an attribute of hatred
[52:18] he does
[52:20] he he has an attribute and he had to
[52:24] display it
[52:25] he had to display it and it must have
[52:27] really broke his heart he had to turn
[52:30] his head away because look at what it
[52:32] says therefore the Lord God sent him
[52:35] forth from the Garden of Eden
[52:39] that you just think about it how many I
[52:41] mean I'm not gonna ask for raised hands
[52:43] but we're all praying for God's will for
[52:45] our lives right Lord what should I do
[52:48] what's the next thing I should do what
[52:49] do you want me to do today what what did
[52:51] I miss today that I should have done or
[52:53] anything else and here is God's
[52:55] commandment to Adam on that day get away
[52:58] from me
[53:04] get away from me drove him
[53:11] look at verse 24.
[53:13] so he drove out the man
[53:17] and he placed at the east of the Garden
[53:19] of Eden cherubims and a flaming sword
[53:21] which turned every way to keep the way
[53:23] of the tree of life it was so it would
[53:27] this sin was so
[53:31] God was so angry
[53:34] that he had to put a cherubim not just
[53:37] any old angel he put a guard of The
[53:40] Mercy Seat
[53:42] he put a guard a seraphim a cherubim a
[53:46] mighty angel
[53:48] with a flaming sword that Adam could
[53:51] never get back
[53:53] to the Tree of Life
[53:56] he could never get back to the
[53:59] fellowship he had with God
[54:01] there was no way back because of this
[54:05] mistake
[54:06] be irreconciled
[54:09] how is he gonna do that
[54:12] how is he ever going to be reconciled to
[54:14] God when man has no Adam you know Adam
[54:18] when he saw that he was naked and he saw
[54:21] that he his heart condemned him and he
[54:23] went he said what am I going to do what
[54:24] I'm going to do and he went and he hid
[54:27] he hid from the presence of God
[54:31] and when he hid from the presence of God
[54:33] then he went and he actually said I'm
[54:36] going to make something to reconcile
[54:38] mutual agreement I'm gonna make a way
[54:42] back and he sowed fig leaves together
[54:44] God rejected it
[54:47] because there was enmity
[54:51] now say me and brother Ron I count him
[54:54] as my friend
[54:56] I hope you count me as your friend
[54:59] so we have Fellowship but if brother Ron
[55:03] would happen to offend me
[55:05] then there becomes a wall
[55:09] because now I don't trust him
[55:11] and there's an enmity there's a Chasm
[55:14] there's there's something that's you
[55:16] know brother Ronnie walks by I shake his
[55:18] hand I hug him now he's going to be
[55:19] watching me all my steps but you know
[55:22] but you can tell
[55:24] you can say the fellowship's not the
[55:26] same
[55:27] something has happened
[55:29] enmity has come in
[55:32] enmity has come in
[55:34] amen
[55:36] in the message Oneness brother Branham
[55:39] says so now Eve she was United until she
[55:42] broke one word or doubted one word being
[55:45] true and that separated her
[55:48] every word man should not live by bread
[55:50] alone but by every word who's living by
[55:53] every word
[55:56] brother Keith
[55:58] are you
[56:00] sister link yeah
[56:02] well you're gutier than I am
[56:07] because when we get up in the morning we
[56:09] break God's word
[56:11] maybe we forget about him till after
[56:13] breakfast
[56:15] maybe we don't thank him for the day
[56:16] maybe we maybe we get in a hurry we get
[56:19] in all these other things man shall live
[56:22] by every word amen
[56:27] so we could be in God United because
[56:30] Adam and Eve before the fall before the
[56:33] disbelieving of the word was an example
[56:36] of what we could be in him to be United
[56:39] with him is life to be separated from
[56:41] him is death and now if we follow his
[56:44] Commandments
[56:46] and broken cistern's brother Adam said
[56:48] so you see God first set the human race
[56:51] on Earth
[56:52] and he told them to live by his word and
[56:55] now the word of God is like a chain and
[56:58] you're passing across hell with it and
[57:00] the chain is only its best at its
[57:02] weakest link and God wants us to keep
[57:04] every word of it now that was the first
[57:07] of the Bible just to break one word
[57:09] pledge the whole human race into the
[57:11] darkness of death
[57:13] amen
[57:15] now the thing is in the conferences
[57:17] brother Brandon makes this statement he
[57:18] says so remember his commandment was the
[57:22] day that you eat thereof that day you
[57:24] die and God cannot defy his own law and
[57:29] be just
[57:30] so he can't even walk over his jaw his
[57:33] law
[57:34] he can't even walk over his judgment
[57:39] the curse that he put on the ground for
[57:42] Adam's sake God couldn't step over that
[57:44] because then he's no longer just
[57:48] he couldn't do that so you see there
[57:51] when Paul Ronan Corinthians he said he
[57:54] became sin
[57:57] because your sin won't work
[58:03] God already knows you're a sinner you're
[58:06] you've been a sinner and that's a whole
[58:08] different message but
[58:10] the thing is is that there is nothing
[58:13] that we can do to atone for this failure
[58:18] on human beings parts
[58:22] so God cannot defy his own laws and be
[58:24] just so he made a great Chasm between
[58:28] him and man
[58:32] enmity
[58:34] he made this great big Chasm you
[58:37] remember Lazarus Lazarus he he was a
[58:41] beggar and and when he died he went in
[58:45] it was in the bosom of Abraham and then
[58:47] there was the Rich Young Ruler and the
[58:50] Rich Young Mueller when he died he went
[58:52] into hell and he said oh Abraham he says
[58:56] dip your finger in the water and bring
[58:59] it over and touch my tongue that my
[59:01] thirst could be quenched because I'm I'm
[59:04] parched and he said I cannot come from
[59:08] here to where you're at because the
[59:11] chasm is way too big
[59:16] God's anger was that strong
[59:21] he was that disappointed in Adam and Eve
[59:26] and what they had done with his word
[59:28] praise the Lord
[59:31] in the called out brother Branham said
[59:33] God will make you pay for your sin he
[59:35] hates sin but I thought he was a god of
[59:38] love he hates sin
[59:41] because he's a holy God and a holy God
[59:45] cannot tolerate sin if he could have
[59:48] stood sin he would have stopped the
[59:50] whole thing when the first sin was
[59:52] committed
[59:54] but that isn't what the scripture said
[59:57] when he saw that man had sinned and he
[59:59] says if he touches the tree of life he
[1:00:02] said that is not a good thing and I am
[1:00:05] going to make sure that he can never
[1:00:08] touch that tree of life
[1:00:10] I am going to put cherubims with flaming
[1:00:13] swords round about it
[1:00:17] it's pretty hopeless
[1:00:21] that's that's pretty hopeless
[1:00:26] if he could have stood sin he would have
[1:00:28] stopped the whole thing when the first
[1:00:29] sin was committed but sin requires death
[1:00:32] and they that do such is dead already
[1:00:35] and sin and trespasses
[1:00:39] in the message pardon brother Bynum says
[1:00:42] so when man sinned in the Garden of Eden
[1:00:45] he crossed a great Chasm
[1:00:48] separating himself from the Eternal God
[1:00:51] man at that time was eternal with God he
[1:00:55] had no sickness no sorrow or death I
[1:00:59] love this next statement man was not
[1:01:01] made to die
[1:01:04] hell was not made for man praise the
[1:01:07] Lord
[1:01:08] hell was created for the devil and his
[1:01:10] angels and not for mankind
[1:01:13] because they were created on Earth to be
[1:01:15] Sons and Daughters of God but when man
[1:01:18] sinned and stepped across the boundary
[1:01:20] line between right and God right and
[1:01:22] wrong he separated himself from God
[1:01:26] leaving himself no way back
[1:01:32] he was totally lost he could not come
[1:01:35] back because he had sinned
[1:01:37] but God rich in Mercy accepted a
[1:01:40] substitute because he had said the day
[1:01:42] that you eat thereof that day you die
[1:01:44] and God's justice and his Holiness
[1:01:47] requires death because it's his word and
[1:01:52] he must keep his word in order to be God
[1:01:59] reconciled reconciliation
[1:02:06] let's go to Ephesians 2. and see what
[1:02:09] Paul said about it
[1:02:13] got your attention now
[1:02:16] Ephesians 2 verse 13.
[1:02:24] he says but now in Christ Jesus ye who
[1:02:27] sometimes were far off
[1:02:30] right great chasm
[1:02:32] our Maiden I by the blood of Christ
[1:02:35] for he is our peace not you
[1:02:39] not what you think you can do or what
[1:02:41] you can bring to God he is our peace who
[1:02:44] hath made both one and hath broken down
[1:02:48] the middle wall of partition between us
[1:02:53] Jesus Christ see there's reconciled
[1:02:58] a mutual agreement between two
[1:03:01] Lost Sinner that's you and the holy God
[1:03:06] that's God and by mutual agreement
[1:03:10] we compound our resources to light the
[1:03:13] Slate clean
[1:03:16] to be reconciled
[1:03:18] for he is our peace
[1:03:21] what made both one and hath broken down
[1:03:24] the middle wall of partition between us
[1:03:27] amen
[1:03:30] having abolished in his flesh the enmity
[1:03:35] the hatred
[1:03:38] even the law of Commandments contained
[1:03:41] in ordinances now this is an interesting
[1:03:44] scripture
[1:03:46] so God in the book in The Book of
[1:03:49] Genesis back there when he had
[1:03:51] fellowship with man God reached down and
[1:03:56] called people and had fellowship with
[1:03:58] them but when he called Israel out of
[1:04:02] Egypt
[1:04:03] the only way that they could have
[1:04:05] fellowship with him
[1:04:06] was through the law of ordinances that
[1:04:10] Moses brought down from the mount
[1:04:12] and God told Moses he said he said
[1:04:17] come here I'm going to tell you
[1:04:18] everything that I require of this people
[1:04:20] for them to be reconciled to me knowing
[1:04:24] full well that they could not for keep
[1:04:27] the word
[1:04:30] knowing full well they could not keep
[1:04:32] the word
[1:04:34] but in those ordinances and the things
[1:04:36] that he wrote down it revealed more
[1:04:39] about the Unseen God
[1:04:42] because you notice that when they feel
[1:04:43] when they made up the Tabernacle in the
[1:04:46] wilderness there was Mercy there wasn't
[1:04:49] there
[1:04:50] the law was there
[1:04:52] the law was in the in the Tabernacle
[1:04:55] um in the Ark of the Covenant the law
[1:04:58] was there The Mercy Seat sat on top of
[1:05:01] the law the cherubims guarded The Mercy
[1:05:04] Seat but you know what you couldn't go
[1:05:06] in there
[1:05:09] because there was a veil
[1:05:12] there was a partition
[1:05:14] there was hatred
[1:05:16] there was there was there was something
[1:05:18] standing there to keep you from being
[1:05:22] reconciled
[1:05:24] and every year people came they came
[1:05:27] every year that is is they sin they go
[1:05:30] to the priests they say what is God's
[1:05:32] law require God take the law an
[1:05:35] ordinance written out he'd say okay you
[1:05:37] did this you defrauded your brother this
[1:05:40] is what you have to do you have to buy
[1:05:42] this bring this bring this and then I
[1:05:45] will accept your sacrifice you bring it
[1:05:48] to the priest you don't get to slay the
[1:05:51] lamb you don't get to slay your own
[1:05:53] sacrifice the priest does
[1:05:55] the priest does the washing the priest
[1:05:58] does the offering the priest offers the
[1:06:02] sacrifice for you and then says you're
[1:06:05] good to go see you next year
[1:06:08] but only once a year
[1:06:11] does somebody go up and break through
[1:06:15] the Veil
[1:06:16] to the mercy seat and put blood on it
[1:06:20] that all of our sins
[1:06:23] they couldn't be reconciled
[1:06:26] they were pushed on
[1:06:30] amen look at verse 15 so he says having
[1:06:33] abolished in his flesh the enmity even
[1:06:36] the law of Commandments contain an
[1:06:38] ordinances for to make in himself of
[1:06:41] Twain one new man so making peace
[1:06:46] verse 14 where it says broken down the
[1:06:49] middle wall of partition between us
[1:06:51] that word means to break up to destroy
[1:06:54] to dissolve to melt
[1:06:58] to put it away
[1:07:00] Jesus Christ
[1:07:02] who is our peace
[1:07:04] when he had made both one and hath
[1:07:07] broken down he wiped it away having
[1:07:11] abolished in his flesh the hatred even
[1:07:14] the law of Commandments contained
[1:07:16] ordinances for to make it himself of
[1:07:19] Twain one new man so making peace amen
[1:07:24] if thou if a man is in Christ then all
[1:07:29] things are made new
[1:07:30] amen it's been reconciled amen praise
[1:07:35] the Lord and that he might reconcile
[1:07:38] both unto God in one body by the cross
[1:07:41] having slain the enmity thereby
[1:07:46] you see
[1:07:47] God had a Chasm there that we couldn't
[1:07:50] cross
[1:07:51] but he he made a way
[1:07:55] I
[1:07:57] I love the idea
[1:07:59] that God
[1:08:01] couldn't even step over his own word
[1:08:05] he couldn't even step over it
[1:08:07] so he had to become sin to fulfill his
[1:08:11] own word to pay the sacrifice because
[1:08:14] you're not good enough
[1:08:16] you will never be able to be good enough
[1:08:19] but when he went and did that it washed
[1:08:22] away all of that
[1:08:25] it melted it away it pushed it away
[1:08:29] so that when I accepted Jesus Christ not
[1:08:32] because of my goodness not because of
[1:08:34] what I can do not what I can bring it's
[1:08:37] a mutual agreement I see I'm completely
[1:08:40] useless
[1:08:41] amen
[1:08:43] and I make an agreement with God and God
[1:08:46] says I will pay the way I will pay the
[1:08:49] price
[1:08:50] if you think about you look at the Book
[1:08:51] of Ruth when when Ruth came back to
[1:08:54] Judea she was not even Of The Bloodline
[1:08:57] only through marriage
[1:09:00] she wasn't even she she had no Jewish
[1:09:03] blood in her at all
[1:09:06] and when she went and labored in the
[1:09:08] field Boaz who was a blood relation to
[1:09:13] you Naomi but no relation to Ruth when
[1:09:18] he redeemed Naomi he had to marry the
[1:09:22] moabite
[1:09:24] praise the Lord
[1:09:25] yeah
[1:09:26] oh hey she had no rights
[1:09:29] she had nothing he had to by his own
[1:09:33] free choice
[1:09:35] by his own free choice
[1:09:38] say I will redeem
[1:09:40] Naomi and Ruth and raise up seed praise
[1:09:46] the Lord
[1:09:48] Amen to reconcile to reconcile that
[1:09:52] which has no ability to reconcile
[1:09:57] we have no we have nothing to bring to
[1:10:00] God not a thing
[1:10:02] our best efforts in the morning praying
[1:10:06] and crying out to God unless the blood
[1:10:09] of Jesus Christ is before you
[1:10:12] God doesn't even have to hear it amen
[1:10:17] but when you're born again if a man be
[1:10:19] in Christ and all things have become new
[1:10:21] then praise the Lord amen
[1:10:26] I've been reconciled amen amen
[1:10:30] amen
[1:10:32] Ephesians 2 16 he says and that he might
[1:10:35] reconcile both unto God and one body by
[1:10:38] the cross having slain or destroyed the
[1:10:42] enmity thereby and came and preached
[1:10:45] peace to you which were afar off and to
[1:10:49] them which were nigh
[1:10:50] for through him we both have access by
[1:10:53] one Spirit unto the father amen now
[1:10:56] therefore you are no more strangers and
[1:10:59] foreigners but fellow citizens with the
[1:11:01] Saints and of the household of God Amen
[1:11:04] brother Brandon in the unveiling of God
[1:11:06] says but since Pentecost since the
[1:11:08] crucifixion when the veil was rent from
[1:11:11] the top to the bottom for that
[1:11:13] generation Jesus was that God veiled
[1:11:17] see when Jesus came he had to come
[1:11:20] according to all of the written
[1:11:22] ordinances that were contained in the
[1:11:24] Old Testament he had to come he had to
[1:11:28] fulfill every prophecy he had to he
[1:11:31] could not leave one of them undone he
[1:11:33] had to fulfill them all he had to
[1:11:36] he had to come
[1:11:38] and when he came
[1:11:40] when he stood and he chose the disciples
[1:11:42] he gave them gifts but they could not be
[1:11:45] reconciled
[1:11:47] they cannot be reconciled till he went
[1:11:49] to Calvary
[1:11:50] because the enmity stopped them from
[1:11:53] that
[1:11:54] the hatred was still there men at sin
[1:11:57] man had failed the word of God but God
[1:12:01] himself came down and fulfilled the word
[1:12:04] God himself came down and did that and
[1:12:07] when he came down and did that he could
[1:12:09] destroy he could rip rip it right up
[1:12:13] look at it's what the scripture says
[1:12:15] amen
[1:12:18] Jesus was that God veiled and when he
[1:12:21] died at Calvary God sent fire and
[1:12:23] lightning and ripped the veil from top
[1:12:25] to the bottom that the whole Mercy Seat
[1:12:27] was now in plain view amen but they were
[1:12:31] too blind to see it and Moses said there
[1:12:33] Paul said reading of Moses when Moses is
[1:12:36] read yet the veil is still on their
[1:12:38] heart brother sister that's what the
[1:12:40] Jews did when the veil was rent and
[1:12:42] brought God in a plain view hanging on
[1:12:45] the cross he was in plain view but they
[1:12:47] couldn't see it amen look at Hebrews 10.
[1:12:52] praise the Lord
[1:12:53] praise the Lord amen
[1:12:56] he's Mighty to be praised
[1:12:58] why because you can't do it
[1:13:03] do it there is nothing you can bring
[1:13:06] look at Hebrews 10 1-3 it says for the
[1:13:09] law having a shadow of good things to
[1:13:11] come
[1:13:13] yes a shadow
[1:13:15] because the shadow was you know brother
[1:13:18] Branham talked about he says if I had he
[1:13:20] says you know if I see a shadow
[1:13:24] he says it's it's a reflection of light
[1:13:26] shining on something that's real
[1:13:30] a shadow is not real
[1:13:32] a shadow is just a reflection of light
[1:13:35] on something and he said so you could
[1:13:37] see a shadow and if you notice in the
[1:13:40] daytime and that and you go and See Your
[1:13:42] Shadow it's distorted
[1:13:45] it's distorted because
[1:13:48] you may look at your Shadow and you
[1:13:50] might be eight feet tall
[1:13:52] well when the reality comes and the
[1:13:53] light is is brought into reflection with
[1:13:56] you and you become one with your Shadow
[1:13:58] find out what your real height is
[1:14:01] or it may look at your wide and fat
[1:14:03] because of reflection off a window or
[1:14:05] something else but when you come into
[1:14:07] the reality of it then when the reality
[1:14:11] comes there is no need for a shadow
[1:14:14] amen
[1:14:15] so he says the law the law all the
[1:14:18] written ordinances that's what we read
[1:14:20] all the written ordinances The Ten
[1:14:23] Commandments all of the laws that are
[1:14:25] contained in Leviticus everything that's
[1:14:27] in Deuteronomy which is the second law
[1:14:29] everything that's in numbers all those
[1:14:31] things all of them they're just a shadow
[1:14:35] they're a shadow of good things to come
[1:14:37] and not the very image of those things
[1:14:40] because the very image was Jesus Christ
[1:14:42] that was the very image and can never
[1:14:46] with those sacrifices which they offered
[1:14:48] year by year continually make the
[1:14:50] Commerce there unto perfect
[1:14:54] or reconciled
[1:14:57] they could never get reconciled
[1:15:01] never
[1:15:04] the balanced book was always going to be
[1:15:07] out of balance
[1:15:08] because they didn't have their funds to
[1:15:12] pay off the debt
[1:15:13] amen
[1:15:15] for then would they not have ceased to
[1:15:17] be offered that's a good question
[1:15:20] he says if the law could do it
[1:15:23] why would he have to come back every
[1:15:24] year
[1:15:25] if the law could take care of it
[1:15:29] because of the worshipers once purged
[1:15:31] should have had no more consciousness of
[1:15:34] sin but in those sacrifices there is a
[1:15:37] remembrance again made of sins every
[1:15:40] year
[1:15:41] and that's why you can't take
[1:15:44] the English word
[1:15:46] reconcile
[1:15:49] which means to bring back into Harmony
[1:15:51] and apply it to the New Testament
[1:15:53] reconcile
[1:15:57] because when God reconciled you all you
[1:16:00] were allowed to do was given Exchange
[1:16:06] just give an exchange say I I Surrender
[1:16:10] Lord
[1:16:11] and when you do that then it becomes a
[1:16:14] mutual agreement
[1:16:16] and when it's a mutual agreement he
[1:16:18] takes care of all of it
[1:16:21] he takes care of every bit of it
[1:16:23] he takes care of every shortcoming he
[1:16:26] takes care of every every spot every
[1:16:28] wrinkle he takes care of every failure
[1:16:31] he takes care of all your all your
[1:16:33] troubles he takes care of all of it if
[1:16:36] you can just give it to him if it can
[1:16:39] just lay it at his feet amen amen for in
[1:16:43] those sacrifices there is Remembrance
[1:16:45] again made of sins every year you see
[1:16:48] when the English when we think of
[1:16:50] reconcile and we think about reconciling
[1:16:53] our bank book or whatever else the debts
[1:16:56] just keep coming they just keep coming
[1:16:57] they just keep coming
[1:16:59] but he that's been purged from his sins
[1:17:03] you're free
[1:17:05] amen let's go to Hebrews 2.
[1:17:08] praise the Lord amen
[1:17:12] amen be ye reconciled
[1:17:15] Hebrews 2 verse 11.
[1:17:19] for both he that sanctifieth that's
[1:17:21] Jesus Christ
[1:17:23] and they who are Sanctified are all of
[1:17:27] One
[1:17:28] well I sure like that
[1:17:30] hahaha
[1:17:31] because a lot of times I don't feel very
[1:17:33] sanctified
[1:17:34] but through his blood I'm sanctified
[1:17:37] amen and Paul says I'm one with him if
[1:17:41] he Sanctified me which he did
[1:17:44] then they that are Sanctified and he
[1:17:46] that did the sanctification
[1:17:48] it's a mutual agreement it's a pure
[1:17:51] reconciliation amen praise the Lord
[1:17:54] praise the Lord
[1:18:01] and they are Sanctified are all one for
[1:18:04] which cause he is not ashamed to call
[1:18:07] them brethren
[1:18:09] see it's not you calling him your
[1:18:13] brother
[1:18:14] he's not ashamed to call brother Mark
[1:18:17] his brother
[1:18:20] his son on one hand but his brother
[1:18:22] that's co-equal
[1:18:25] co-equal a brother
[1:18:28] you know in a in a court proceeding when
[1:18:32] you have an inheritance
[1:18:33] it's evenly distributed
[1:18:36] if there's no if there's no will all the
[1:18:39] heirs their joint heirs
[1:18:40] and Joint means equal
[1:18:43] and he that sanctifieth and he that's
[1:18:45] been Sanctified are all of One
[1:18:47] praise the Lord
[1:18:49] that ought to be enough welder should be
[1:18:51] jumping and go ahead run the aisles
[1:18:55] amen
[1:18:57] saying I will declare thy name unto my
[1:18:59] brethren in the midst of the church will
[1:19:01] I sing praise unto thee and again I will
[1:19:04] put my trust in him and again behold I
[1:19:08] and the children which God hath given me
[1:19:10] for as much then as the children are
[1:19:13] partakers of Flesh and Blood now here's
[1:19:15] the key
[1:19:16] he says for he knows that you are flesh
[1:19:19] and blood
[1:19:21] which means you're born in sin shaping
[1:19:25] and iniquity right
[1:19:26] that means
[1:19:28] you can't help it
[1:19:30] this body is cursed
[1:19:32] it's you know the devil has a right to
[1:19:35] give sickness to it
[1:19:36] the devil has a right to put you in the
[1:19:39] corner and let you blow up and go off
[1:19:42] the handle
[1:19:43] yeah
[1:19:44] he's got a right to get in there and
[1:19:46] push you to the limit to to
[1:19:50] commit murder commit adultery to do all
[1:19:54] kinds of wicked things
[1:19:56] because your flesh and blood
[1:19:59] you are flesh and blood
[1:20:01] God is going to redeem this but that's
[1:20:04] not till the body change
[1:20:06] so right now he's Redeeming the inside
[1:20:09] amen the Holy Ghost is on the inside
[1:20:12] it's on the inside
[1:20:15] it's the inside that becomes new when I
[1:20:17] became when I when I was a sinner
[1:20:21] I looked like me
[1:20:23] when I became a saint I still look like
[1:20:26] me
[1:20:28] but something on the inside had changed
[1:20:30] amen
[1:20:33] for as much then as the children are
[1:20:35] partakers of Flesh and Blood he also
[1:20:39] himself likewise took part of the same
[1:20:44] that's why he couldn't do it with a lamb
[1:20:46] a lamb wouldn't work
[1:20:49] it had to be Flesh and Blood Flesh and
[1:20:51] Blood like you have flesh and blood that
[1:20:54] fell in the Garden of Eden and when it
[1:20:56] fell in the Garden of Eden God said I
[1:20:59] have to have
[1:21:00] some way to redeem my lost seed
[1:21:07] either must be a way to get them back
[1:21:10] but the chasm was so great because if he
[1:21:13] broke his law to save his children
[1:21:17] then he's no longer God
[1:21:23] a true reconciliation
[1:21:26] amen praise the Lord amen
[1:21:29] amen
[1:21:32] for as much then as the children are
[1:21:34] partakers of Flesh and Blood he also
[1:21:36] himself likewise took part of the same
[1:21:39] that through death he might destroy him
[1:21:43] that had the power of death that is the
[1:21:46] devil
[1:21:47] and deliver or liberate them who through
[1:21:52] fear of death were all of their lifetime
[1:21:54] subject to bondage or slavery
[1:21:58] for verily he took not on him the nature
[1:22:01] of angels but he took on him the Seed of
[1:22:06] Abraham
[1:22:07] praise the Lord
[1:22:09] praise the Lord
[1:22:10] praise the Lord
[1:22:12] yes
[1:22:14] to be reconciled to be free free of my
[1:22:19] sin free of my shortcoming free of my
[1:22:22] thoughts free of everything that that
[1:22:25] bothers me he has taken it and nailed it
[1:22:28] to the Cross because when he nailed the
[1:22:30] ordinance to the Cross then I'm no
[1:22:31] longer accountable for those things
[1:22:33] praise the Lord
[1:22:35] praise the Lord amen
[1:22:37] amen
[1:22:39] and then in verse 17 it says
[1:22:42] wherefore in all things it behooved him
[1:22:46] to be made like unto his brethren
[1:22:49] then he might be a merciful and faithful
[1:22:52] high priest in all things pertaining to
[1:22:56] God to make
[1:22:58] reconciliation for the sins of the
[1:23:02] people hallelujah
[1:23:05] Hallelujah
[1:23:06] amen
[1:23:08] amen
[1:23:10] I hope you're hearing me because
[1:23:16] praise the Lord amen let's go to Romans
[1:23:19] 8. look at what Romans 8 says
[1:23:22] in light of these things
[1:23:24] amen
[1:23:26] in light of these things look at what
[1:23:29] Romans 8 says
[1:23:31] therefore there is therefore now no
[1:23:36] condemnation to them which are in Christ
[1:23:39] Jesus who walk not after the flesh but
[1:23:43] after the spirit
[1:23:45] for the law of the spirit of life in
[1:23:48] Christ Jesus has made me free from the
[1:23:51] law of sin and death amen that's the Ten
[1:23:55] Commandments
[1:23:58] he's made me free from that
[1:24:00] It's Made Me free from the ordinances
[1:24:02] this otherwise you're going to tell me
[1:24:04] you don't believe the Scripture it says
[1:24:05] he took those written ordinances and
[1:24:07] nailed them to the tree
[1:24:09] I just read it
[1:24:11] he nailed it to the tree
[1:24:14] and took my place so I don't have to die
[1:24:17] praise the Lord I don't have to have 30
[1:24:20] stripes for every time I mess up praise
[1:24:23] the Lord
[1:24:24] praise the Lord amen
[1:24:27] he says look at what verse 3 says for
[1:24:30] what the law could not do
[1:24:36] the law could not reconcile you
[1:24:41] for what the law could not do in that it
[1:24:44] was weak through the flesh
[1:24:46] praise the Lord
[1:24:49] I'm such a failure
[1:24:53] every day I make mistakes I get
[1:24:56] depressed I get upset I yell at my wife
[1:24:59] she yells back we we have all these
[1:25:01] problems but God is not we're weak
[1:25:05] but God doesn't expect us to pay for the
[1:25:09] penalty of our own failures
[1:25:12] he sent himself
[1:25:15] he did not take the form of angels but
[1:25:18] he took a form of a Seed of Abraham
[1:25:21] walked where we walked felt Temptation
[1:25:25] like we feel we fall he did not he was
[1:25:30] tried he fulfilled every scripture he
[1:25:32] did all these things so that I could be
[1:25:34] reconciled amen amen amen
[1:25:39] praise God Amen
[1:25:43] God's sending his own son for the
[1:25:46] likeness of sinful flesh see in the
[1:25:48] likeness of sinful flesh what did
[1:25:51] Corinthians say
[1:25:52] he became sin he was not sin
[1:25:59] but he became sin
[1:26:02] he had no fault but he became fault
[1:26:06] he had no shortcomings but he became
[1:26:09] them
[1:26:10] where he saw you can't handle your
[1:26:11] temper he became that
[1:26:14] where he saw you can't overcome this
[1:26:16] problem or that problem he became it he
[1:26:19] became it that if you if you mutually
[1:26:22] agree if you mutually say Lord reconcile
[1:26:26] me
[1:26:27] he who has the bank of Heaven he can
[1:26:30] come down and pay the debt and you know
[1:26:32] what once he blotted it away that's the
[1:26:35] other scripture we read he said he
[1:26:37] blooded it away it's gone the electric
[1:26:40] Bill's not coming again
[1:26:44] that's the difference the bill doesn't
[1:26:47] come again
[1:26:50] does not the scriptures tell us it says
[1:26:52] does Jesus Christ go to the calvary and
[1:26:54] then he has to go back and be crucified
[1:26:56] again and then go back and get crucified
[1:26:57] again and get crucified again for your
[1:27:00] sins he said no he said this man by one
[1:27:03] time one blood one sacrifice
[1:27:07] reconciled all of it took care of all of
[1:27:10] it set us free amen
[1:27:14] amen praise the Lord amen
[1:27:18] amen it gives us a lot of Hope brother
[1:27:21] Johnson I'm telling you we're failures
[1:27:24] we know that
[1:27:28] he condemned sin in the flesh that the
[1:27:31] righteousness of the law might be
[1:27:34] fulfilled in us who walk not after the
[1:27:37] flesh but after the spirit
[1:27:40] oh Hallelujah
[1:27:43] Hallelujah
[1:27:44] amen and forsaking all brother Branham
[1:27:47] said so we do not want to try to enter
[1:27:49] his into thy presence with sin upon us
[1:27:54] is that right we don't want to do that
[1:27:57] therefore knowing that each day troubles
[1:28:01] and things that beset us that might not
[1:28:04] even be noticed in our own thinking
[1:28:08] but
[1:28:10] when we come to think of a holy God who
[1:28:13] even angels are dirty in his sight
[1:28:16] now dwell on that for a bit
[1:28:20] here was God
[1:28:22] and he wanted to express himself back in
[1:28:25] the Garden of Eden and angels looked
[1:28:28] dirty in his sight
[1:28:31] so when Adam fell and Eve fell
[1:28:35] that anger was released
[1:28:40] that hatred of sin was released and it
[1:28:44] made such a huge Chasm brother random
[1:28:47] said he said Adam could never come back
[1:28:51] you think God drove Adam out of his
[1:28:54] presence he drove him out and then Adam
[1:28:58] had to go get an innocent lamb and kill
[1:29:02] it sacrifice it not knowing
[1:29:07] that God would accept it
[1:29:13] because the first lamb that was slain
[1:29:15] God did the slang
[1:29:21] so from that point all the way to Mount
[1:29:25] Sinai Moses
[1:29:27] from that point on there was always that
[1:29:29] doubt
[1:29:30] will God accept this
[1:29:32] will God accept this you know when God
[1:29:35] met Abraham on the mountain and God told
[1:29:38] Abraham he says Abraham he says come up
[1:29:40] to the spot because Abraham was at this
[1:29:43] question he said Lord he said you gave
[1:29:44] me a promise I'm going to be the father
[1:29:46] of many nations he says all I got is
[1:29:48] Eliezer
[1:29:49] it's a Damascus and he says Ishmael I
[1:29:52] mean where where is my son God told
[1:29:56] Abraham the sacrifice that he must bring
[1:30:04] go back and read it
[1:30:06] Abraham didn't come up with his own idea
[1:30:08] the two turtle doves and the and the
[1:30:11] lamb and the Bullock and that he didn't
[1:30:13] do that God came down to Abraham and
[1:30:15] said do this this and this and this and
[1:30:18] then
[1:30:19] in Abraham he took those things and
[1:30:22] brother Branham said he he he he laid
[1:30:25] him out he got him going and he says the
[1:30:28] horror of Darkness came and he said the
[1:30:30] birds came and brother Branham and I
[1:30:32] think brother John preached about this
[1:30:33] about he had he had to shoo the birds
[1:30:36] away away from the sacrifice they had to
[1:30:39] keep the sacrifice clean
[1:30:40] Waiting for God
[1:30:45] and he said a a lamp came down and
[1:30:49] walked amongst there and he said a deep
[1:30:52] sleep the horror of hell
[1:30:55] It Came Upon him
[1:30:57] and he said and then God spoke to him
[1:30:59] after he accepted the sacrifice
[1:31:02] see there's no sacrifice you can make
[1:31:05] there's nothing you can bring to be
[1:31:08] reconciled to God except accepting Jesus
[1:31:12] Christ
[1:31:13] because Jesus Christ is the Fulfillment
[1:31:16] of all of what God promised amen amen
[1:31:21] praise the Lord amen the angels are
[1:31:24] dirty in his sight and then we know Lord
[1:31:26] that we have not even a chance unless we
[1:31:30] come through the blood of Jesus Christ
[1:31:31] and then we are the children of God and
[1:31:34] our mistakes are overlooked as we
[1:31:36] confess them okay Colossians 2.
[1:31:41] praise the Lord amen
[1:31:44] Colossians 2 verse 9.
[1:31:51] for in him dwelleth all the fullness of
[1:31:54] the godhead bodily and we are complete
[1:31:57] in him which is the head of all
[1:32:00] principalities and Power
[1:32:02] and whom also
[1:32:04] ye are circumcised with the circumcision
[1:32:07] made without hands how is that possible
[1:32:12] God is doing the circumcising
[1:32:16] right the Bible talks about circumcising
[1:32:19] your heart try it
[1:32:22] are you going to get a knife and
[1:32:24] cut your heart
[1:32:27] God Is circumcising Us
[1:32:30] putting off the body of the sins of the
[1:32:34] flesh by the circumcision of Christ
[1:32:37] you see God is doing this
[1:32:40] buried with him in baptism
[1:32:43] wherein also you are risen with him
[1:32:45] through the faith of the operation of
[1:32:48] God who hath raised him from the dead
[1:32:51] amen
[1:32:52] amen and you being dead in your sins and
[1:32:55] we are
[1:32:56] right
[1:32:58] dead in our sins and the uncircumcision
[1:33:00] of your flesh
[1:33:03] has he quickened
[1:33:05] together with him having forgiven you
[1:33:09] all trespasses
[1:33:12] remember that first scripture we read
[1:33:14] God reconciling himself reconciling the
[1:33:19] world not imputing their trespasses
[1:33:28] wow
[1:33:32] in Christ he did that
[1:33:37] and you being dead in your sins and
[1:33:39] uncircumcision or your flesh hath he
[1:33:41] quickened together with him having
[1:33:42] forgiven you all trespasses
[1:33:45] blotting out the handwriting of
[1:33:48] ordinances
[1:33:50] amen
[1:33:52] blotting out the handwriting of
[1:33:54] ordinances that was against us which was
[1:33:58] contrary to us and took it out of the
[1:34:01] way nailing it to the cross
[1:34:05] oh I would love to be humble and sweet
[1:34:08] but I just have the wrong genetic makeup
[1:34:12] right
[1:34:13] oh I would love not to be hot tempered
[1:34:16] but I got the wrong I got the wrong
[1:34:18] flesh body
[1:34:20] because none of the fault of my own but
[1:34:23] because I'm flesh and blood
[1:34:25] amen
[1:34:26] some of us are smart not if there's no
[1:34:29] fault of our own some of us are not
[1:34:31] some of us are are you know we're
[1:34:35] creative and others we're thinkers
[1:34:39] people are all different but you see
[1:34:42] God he realized that and his forgiveness
[1:34:46] of all your trespasses is the blooding
[1:34:50] Out means to smear out that means
[1:34:52] obliterate
[1:34:55] erase it
[1:34:57] figuratively pardon sin blatted out wipe
[1:35:02] it away
[1:35:04] in the original it says having blotted
[1:35:06] out what was written by hand in
[1:35:08] ordinances which was against us that's
[1:35:12] the Ten Commandments Leviticus all the
[1:35:14] law he says and has removed it from the
[1:35:17] midst having nailed it to the Cross you
[1:35:20] see that law
[1:35:23] was the enmity that kept you from The
[1:35:26] Mercy Seat
[1:35:28] those ordinances is what kept you from
[1:35:31] finding peace with God
[1:35:34] but God himself came down and took his
[1:35:38] own law the ordinances that he had wrote
[1:35:41] that Moses he had given to Moses and he
[1:35:44] nailed it to Calvary and fulfilled all
[1:35:47] of it that I could be reconciled amen
[1:35:51] and having spoiled principalities and
[1:35:54] Powers he made a show of them openly
[1:35:57] triumphing over them in it amen amen
[1:36:02] brother Branham says so now in that day
[1:36:06] God guarded the tree to keep them from
[1:36:11] getting it and now the sword is turned
[1:36:14] right back the other way now running
[1:36:17] them right back to that tree so that
[1:36:20] they will receive the life driving
[1:36:22] people hurting them to the Tree of Life
[1:36:26] how marvelous
[1:36:29] be ye reconciled amen
[1:36:34] yeah
[1:36:36] God has taken care of whatever your fear
[1:36:39] is God's taken care of it
[1:36:41] whatever your problems are God is taking
[1:36:43] care of it
[1:36:45] your secret things he's taking care of
[1:36:47] it it's done
[1:36:50] he became sin
[1:36:52] so you don't have to die
[1:36:54] if you can just
[1:36:58] exchange it just give it to him
[1:37:01] let's bar heads
[1:37:04] dear Lord Jesus
[1:37:06] we're so thankful
[1:37:08] that the word of reconciliation father
[1:37:11] it has come to us and we're thankful
[1:37:14] Lord that you saved us and you you paid
[1:37:18] the sacrifice that we couldn't pay we
[1:37:20] didn't have we didn't have a way to take
[1:37:23] care of all of our sin
[1:37:26] but he who had no sin came and became
[1:37:30] sin to set us free
[1:37:33] and I pray Lord you know just take this
[1:37:35] simple thought Lord and father that
[1:37:37] you'll deal with us with it that will
[1:37:39] dwell on it that will think about it

[1:37:45] light of the day may we see that we're
