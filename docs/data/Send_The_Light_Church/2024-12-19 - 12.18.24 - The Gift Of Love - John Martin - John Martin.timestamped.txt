[21:13] we have a special amen we haven't had a
[21:16] special in a while so it's always
[21:18] blessed to have a special amen
[21:32] bless you
[21:34] guys I uh I have this little devotional
[21:37] at home that I read sometimes and um
[21:40] it's written so they took it and they
[21:43] wrote it from the foxy book of Martyrs
[21:45] and they made like little devotionals
[21:47] for every day and I was reading it the
[21:51] other day and there's a little story in
[21:52] there that just caught my heart and so
[21:55] there was this young man that had given
[21:58] his heart to the Lord this was over in
[22:00] the Middle East and he had given his
[22:02] heart to the Lord and he he went out and
[22:05] he started witnessing everywhere for
[22:07] Christ and just wanted to Proclaim you
[22:11] know Christ to the world around him and
[22:14] he he told the Lord he said I I'll do
[22:17] anything for you I mean you've saved my
[22:19] life I'll do anything and he he just he
[22:22] was real strong and you know like
[22:25] passionate and so after about a few few
[22:28] months they threw him in
[22:30] jail and he he's sitting there in the
[22:34] jail cell and he's like having a
[22:36] conversation with the Lord and he's like
[22:38] Lord how could you do this to me you
[22:41] know I I said I would do anything for
[22:42] you and I would give my life and I would
[22:44] I'd be a witness for you and he just
[22:48] said how how could you allow this to
[22:50] happen and you know he's he's kind of
[22:53] complaining a little bit
[22:55] and like he just said he felt the Lord
[22:57] whisper to his heart these words and he
[23:00] said you said that you would do anything
[23:02] for me did you mean
[23:05] it and he thought about that you know he
[23:07] thought about what the Lord had spoke to
[23:09] him and took a few minutes and he he
[23:12] just bowed his head and he said I really
[23:13] mean it Lord I really mean it and he
[23:16] ended up being in prison for like 3 and
[23:18] a half years but he had given everything
[23:20] he could he ended up witnessing to the
[23:22] prison guards and you know ended up just
[23:25] being a a light to the people that were
[23:28] there
[23:28] but to me I just when I read that it
[23:30] just struck my heart because sometimes
[23:33] you know we
[23:34] tell things to the Lord and we don't
[23:37] always follow through and he he had an
[23:41] opportunity to follow through and he did
[23:43] it and it just me something to my heart
[23:46] just to keep God the focus and the
[23:48] center of of
[23:50] everything and just not to lose sight of
[23:53] that
[23:54] so um the Lord just kind of laid this
[23:57] song on my heart earlier tonight and I
[23:59] just wanted to sing
[24:00] it be a blessing to
[24:04] you seems I have a milon things to
[24:11] do everything gets plac in front of
[24:17] you but lord it's not my
[24:22] desire to see it go that way

[39:20] that we can count on
[39:23] you
[39:24] to to carry us through Lord Lord to the
[39:28] very end it's our goal Lord Jesus to re
[39:32] to be with you in in heaven that's why
[39:34] we made the decision years ago Lord and
[39:37] we know that it's not
[39:39] a some quick decision but we've counted
[39:42] the cost and we've we're still here
[39:47] today Lord standing for you because you
[39:51] have stood for us and we thank you for
[39:53] your gift of love that you've given to
[39:55] us and now Lord we know that you've
[39:57] asked us to take this gift pass it on to
[40:00] others we ask you to come today Lord in
[40:03] the ministry of the word You' come today
[40:06] in the revealing of the word Lord that
[40:08] you would uh just take away anything
[40:11] from this time Lord that's been
[40:14] dedicated to you take any thoughts any
[40:18] doubts any fears anything that would try
[40:20] to separate us Lord from being able to
[40:22] receive from you ask that you just come
[40:25] now Lord remember those that Lord are
[40:27] not here today for some reason some
[40:31] sicknesses Lord thou knowest we just ask
[40:33] that Lord you would be with each and
[40:36] that you would meet their need Lord help
[40:37] them in this this
[40:40] time we thank you now for all this for
[40:42] we ask it in Jesus Christ's name amen
[40:46] amen wonderful scripture here in St John
[40:48] chapter 3 verse 16 maybe perhaps the
[40:52] scripture that would have been read the
[40:53] most in all the
[40:55] Bible for God so loved the world that he
[40:58] gave his only begotten son that
[41:01] whosoever believeth in him should not
[41:04] perish but have everlasting life amen
[41:08] God bless you you may be
[41:11] seated this was truly God's Gift of
[41:17] Love he didn't
[41:20] um he didn't create Adam and say Adam
[41:23] you give yourself thank you
[41:27] um
[41:30] he well number one there was nobody
[41:33] worthy after the fall to pay for our
[41:37] sins and he came
[41:42] himself an expression of how great his
[41:45] love
[41:46] was that he gave himself for us and I
[41:51] think sometimes when we don't think
[41:53] about this great gift that he gives us
[41:56] we can maybe a little bit take for
[41:59] granted or or or forget just how much
[42:02] God loves us but he did not uh do this
[42:06] and ever have a regret that he did
[42:09] it no matter how many people have um not
[42:14] got up in the morning to say thank you
[42:16] Lord for salvation thank you for for for
[42:19] loving me there are those that belong to
[42:23] him that have
[42:25] that uh gratefulness inside of them that
[42:30] given their life to express their
[42:32] Thanksgiving back to
[42:34] God you see here in Luke 2:1 just trying
[42:38] to get a little Foundation here of what
[42:41] happened on what most people call
[42:43] Christmas here and the angel said unto
[42:46] them fear not for behold I bring you
[42:49] good tidings of great joy which shall be
[42:53] to all people and this is the Angel
[42:56] making a declaration to the people an
[42:59] announcement to the People For unto you
[43:02] is Born This Day in the city of David a
[43:05] savior which is Christ the lord and that
[43:09] that is just a paradox in itself that um
[43:13] a baby is a savior when you think of a a
[43:16] savior that some is going to like save
[43:17] the country uh you you think of Great
[43:20] Men like Alexander or Napoleon or you
[43:25] know great leaders that are already
[43:27] established and they've got power to do
[43:30] things that they're really going to be
[43:32] the S they're the Savior but here it is
[43:35] this is a they're talking about a baby
[43:37] never been done in history that this
[43:39] baby is going to be the Savior
[43:42] amen and this shall be a sign unto you
[43:45] shall find the Babe wrapped in swalling
[43:48] clothes laying in the manger and
[43:51] suddenly after that was said there was
[43:55] with the angel a multitude of heavenly
[43:58] hostes praising God and saying glory to
[44:00] God in the highest and on Earth peace
[44:02] and Good Will toward men
[44:05] amen so all of Heaven knew what was
[44:08] going
[44:09] onen and they were all behind this great
[44:12] gift of of love that God had finally
[44:16] given to the world this gift of love
[44:19] wrapped up in a babe but we know that
[44:22] this babe in
[44:24] itself could not go to
[44:28] Calvary amen amen we're gonna have to
[44:32] start over because because we're going
[44:34] to start all over because no I'm just
[44:38] kidding because he wasn't even at the
[44:41] age of accountability he didn't even
[44:43] learn obedience by the things he
[44:45] suffered yet so he had to get to a place
[44:48] where he could freely give his life give
[44:51] himself as a gift at
[44:54] Calvary in John chapter 19 verse 28 and
[44:58] this Jesus knowing that all things were
[45:01] now accomplished that the scripture
[45:03] might be fulfilled saith I thirst now
[45:07] there was set a vessel of vinegar and
[45:10] and there they filled a sponge with
[45:12] vinegar and put it upon his up and put
[45:14] it to his mouth and when Jesus therefore
[45:17] had received the vinegar he said it is
[45:20] finished and he bowed his head and he
[45:23] gave up the ghost so he gave his life
[45:27] right there at that moment there was no
[45:30] more uh life inside of him he gave his
[45:33] life
[45:37] freely really appreciate that special
[45:41] today Jesus the center of our
[45:46] life so here with this gift it was not
[45:49] just given in a in a baby but it was
[45:52] also given into life and so often when I
[45:54] know when I was growing up you know the
[45:57] only thing I thought about Christmas was
[45:58] a baby being born in a manger and
[46:01] somehow there was gifts they tied in the
[46:04] three wise
[46:05] men which was you know a couple years
[46:07] later right something like
[46:09] that but really the true gift was him
[46:12] giving of himself when he come to age of
[46:14] accountability just like us the greatest
[46:16] gift that we can give back to God is
[46:18] give our lives back to
[46:22] God God gave himself as a gift of love
[46:25] to us to say save us from Hell from our
[46:29] old nature from ourselves he saved us
[46:32] from
[46:34] ourselves he gave himself a gift of love
[46:37] to heal us to heal our minds to our our
[46:40] brokenhearted our our Spirits our souls
[46:43] to cover us from our iniquities and our
[46:45] transgression and to restore us back
[46:48] unto eternal life this was the gift of
[46:51] God's love to us and this gift was open
[46:54] to us and we all benefited in some ways
[46:57] we've all been blessed by God in various
[47:00] ways but the greatest gift of all that
[47:03] he could have given was giving himself
[47:05] his himself that we could be saved
[47:09] eternally because we could be healed we
[47:11] could even live to be 300 and that would
[47:13] be a great blessing more than other
[47:15] people we could say that would be a
[47:17] great blessing we could all be rich and
[47:19] be not just millionaires but literally
[47:22] be a billionaire and and God could
[47:25] Prosper Us in so many ways that we could
[47:27] have lots of family and lots of friends
[47:29] and and and be known by others around
[47:32] the world and and we could really have a
[47:34] good life but in reality there was
[47:37] nothing greater that God could do for
[47:39] any of us than to save our souls and we
[47:42] all here today are on the same level
[47:44] could be rejoicing the same that God has
[47:46] blessed us the same nothing else
[47:49] matters you don't need to look at other
[47:54] things now while God was here in Earth
[47:57] in the fullness of Jesus Christ he made
[47:59] a promise to us to each of us and that
[48:02] he would send back the same gift of love
[48:06] to dwell inside of
[48:08] us the same
[48:11] gift John 148 he makes this promise he
[48:15] says I will not leave you
[48:18] comfortless I will come to
[48:21] you we're
[48:23] taught that I a personal pronoun it's
[48:26] referring to the person who's speaking
[48:28] that once God Jesus Christ died on the
[48:31] cross he gave up the goals that he was
[48:34] coming
[48:35] back and that when he comes back he was
[48:38] going to comfort us and I'll tell you
[48:39] there's nothing more comforting in a
[48:41] heart of a man than to be filled with
[48:44] the love of Jesus Christ nothing nothing
[48:47] because it's the greatest love right you
[48:50] you there's such a there's you know when
[48:52] God God never picked and
[48:55] choose who he was going to save
[48:58] understand what I'm saying he said all
[49:01] that come to me I will no wise cast out
[49:04] he's no respector
[49:06] persons now we know only those that are
[49:09] his can come to him but the point that
[49:10] I'm trying to make is God's love is
[49:15] unconditional and that doesn't matter
[49:17] how big of a sinner we
[49:19] are doesn't matter what we've done in
[49:21] our
[49:23] past God's love
[49:28] God's love is superior over all that and
[49:32] now he's telling us here that he's going
[49:33] to come back he's going to come back and
[49:35] comfort us with the same love he's in
[49:37] verse 19 yet a little while and the
[49:40] world's is is not going to see me
[49:43] anymore but you're going to see me
[49:46] because I
[49:48] live you shall live
[49:52] also he's letting us know we're going to
[49:54] be just like him the same
[49:57] he says at that day you shall know that
[50:00] I'm in the father that you're in me and
[50:03] that I am in
[50:04] you that is that is a union right there
[50:09] and he that haveth my Commandments and
[50:12] keepeth them he it is that loveth me and
[50:16] he that loveth me shall be loved to my
[50:18] father and I will love him and will
[50:20] manifest myself to him
[50:27] now there is where lies the key right
[50:31] there to receiving the gift of
[50:35] God it's in taking God's word and say I
[50:39] love this word enough to obey it and by
[50:44] doing that God gives you more of
[50:48] him which you cannot separate the love
[50:50] of God and the Holy Ghost you can't
[50:53] separate them they're the same Judas
[50:55] saith unto him not as scar Lord how is
[50:57] it that thou will manifest thyself unto
[50:59] us and not unto everybody else in the
[51:02] world because you know that right now
[51:04] they're looking at Jesus on the outside
[51:07] there's Jesus he performs a miracle uh
[51:10] Lazarus comes forth from the grave
[51:11] everybody sees it he feeds the five the
[51:14] multitude everybody sees it it's
[51:16] manifested and now Judas is saying how
[51:19] are you going to manifest that to us but
[51:22] not to
[51:24] them because it's going to be in the
[51:26] form of the Holy Ghost Inside and Jesus
[51:29] answered and said unto him if a man
[51:32] loves me he will keep my words and my
[51:37] father will love him and we will come
[51:39] unto him and make our abold with
[51:44] him so this gift of love that God gave
[51:47] to the world he's
[51:49] saying I'm going to transer it into you
[51:53] you're going to have it now how many
[51:55] believe that Jesus Jesus is
[51:58] real then you must believe that this
[52:01] Same Spirit that was in Jesus if it
[52:03] lives in you it will be just as real
[52:05] inside of
[52:06] you it's not some Christmas gift under
[52:10] the
[52:11] tree the love of God is the is the life
[52:14] of
[52:16] God he promised that he would come and
[52:20] make us AB bold and we all want more of
[52:23] the a bold
[52:24] right key is be serious
[52:29] about having the word come in you cannot
[52:32] receive the word of God without
[52:33] receiving
[52:34] God now you can be blessed by the
[52:37] anointing of God you can be blessed by
[52:40] God even the our enemies are blessed by
[52:43] God he makes the sun to rise and the
[52:45] just and the unjust God can do that but
[52:49] we're talking about coming in and taking
[52:50] the
[52:52] Abode making the Abode living inside you
[52:57] you ever been blessed so blessed by God
[52:59] I mean you felt the anointing it was so
[53:00] real you were so happy you were either
[53:02] crying or you were laughing you were
[53:04] dancing and it wasn't like 24 hours
[53:07] later and you were upset and
[53:09] angry ever experienced
[53:13] that there's a difference between it
[53:16] being on the outside and being on the
[53:19] inside and when it's on the inside it it
[53:22] I'm not saying you don't ever make a
[53:24] mistake I would never say those words
[53:26] but what I am saying is it takes a hold
[53:30] and your life begins to manifest love
[53:32] towards
[53:36] everybody I I say when that happens the
[53:38] love of God comes in you just start
[53:40] loving
[53:41] everybody I'm G to say it again if
[53:43] you're not going to say more
[53:45] amens in order for the comforter to come
[53:47] in there is a condition to the Clause
[53:50] it's a conditional Clause a conditional
[53:53] promise and that is a man must love
[53:56] Jesus enough to keep his words we all
[54:00] want more of the love of God we want to
[54:01] be able to like when we get slapped on
[54:03] the face to love somebody we want to be
[54:05] to be so full of God that that no matter
[54:08] what happens what however we get spilt
[54:10] nothing but love comes out of us the
[54:13] answer is to love God enough to keep
[54:17] more of the
[54:18] word you know so many people just they
[54:21] they have this this thought process I'm
[54:23] just going to come to the altar I'm
[54:24] going to pray till I get the Holy Ghost
[54:26] I'm going have that anointing come down
[54:27] on me and I'm going to be filled with
[54:29] the Holy Ghost
[54:31] and they're not thinking about keeping
[54:34] the word they're just thinking that the
[54:37] Holy Ghost is something different than
[54:39] the
[54:39] word too many people think the Holy
[54:42] Ghost is different than the love of
[54:44] God I've got the I've got the Holy Ghost
[54:47] but I'm working on the love of
[54:49] God what are you going to do are you
[54:51] going to take God we know we you can't
[54:53] take God and and separate them into
[54:55] three person's Father Son and the Holy
[54:57] Ghost how are we going to take God and
[54:59] separate him from love because God is
[55:02] love God is love we can't separate
[55:08] that
[55:11] so our
[55:13] goal our goal ought to be is Lord let me
[55:17] be a Shining Light let me manifest the
[55:20] love of
[55:22] God
[55:24] acts um chapter 5:32 says Peter said we
[55:29] are his Witnesses of these things and so
[55:33] is the Holy Ghost two witnesses the
[55:36] disciples and the Holy Ghost whom God
[55:40] has given to them that obey him so this
[55:46] gift of
[55:47] love I mean God is so good he's just
[55:50] good to all his children you know if
[55:52] your child is being bad you're still
[55:54] going to love your child you may correct
[55:57] them may spank them you may be
[56:00] disappointed in their behavior but no
[56:02] matter what you're going to love
[56:06] them but God gives the Holy Ghost to
[56:09] them that obey him not to them that he
[56:12] loves there's a big difference in other
[56:15] words there's an expectation that God
[56:17] has of his children to mature to grow up
[56:20] to start saying Lord I love you enough
[56:23] to begin to obey you
[56:25] more and and then God says
[56:27] okay I'm going to give you more of my
[56:29] love you reciprocated love to me by
[56:33] obeying me that if you love me keep my
[56:35] Commandments he said you reciprocate
[56:37] that love back to God then God says I'm
[56:40] going to give you more of me amen and
[56:43] that's how you grow in the love of
[56:45] God it isn't like well I'm going to come
[56:47] to the altar a little bit longer I'm
[56:48] going to get you know sprayed on by the
[56:50] Holy Ghost a little bit more and I'm
[56:51] going to have a little bit more and
[56:52] you're not even thinking about how I can
[56:54] obey the word more
[57:00] I believe that God is so
[57:03] pleased keep his
[57:05] word that it needs to become our
[57:07] greatest interest you know there's so
[57:09] many people out there there're so-called
[57:11] uh Believers and churchgoers and you
[57:13] know they call themselves Christians and
[57:15] you know they they don't it doesn't
[57:18] matter to them if they obey the word
[57:20] they always got a reason to do their own
[57:22] will you understand what I'm saying and
[57:25] like God understands
[57:28] what where is that script where is that
[57:30] in the
[57:31] Bible so that's why Jesus said search
[57:35] the
[57:36] scriptures search the scriptures I'm so
[57:38] glad God a son a
[57:39] prophet to to make it straight to me so
[57:43] I can know for surely what God's going
[57:45] to accept or
[57:47] not and we know that he stays with his
[57:50] word that he's the same yesterday today
[57:53] and forever he's not going to deviate
[57:54] from this word Acts
[57:57] 2:38 Peter makes this has the keys here
[58:02] and he says repent and be baptized every
[58:05] one of you in the name of Jesus Christ
[58:07] for the remission of your sins and you
[58:09] shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost
[58:12] or we might say the gift of love because
[58:14] you're not going to get the don't tell
[58:16] me you've got the Holy Ghost but you
[58:18] don't
[58:19] love I will never believe you I will
[58:23] never believe
[58:24] you when you re receive the Holy Ghost
[58:27] you receive the love of God you can't
[58:30] split them
[58:34] up Peter gave us the key to open the
[58:38] gift of love that God gave God gave the
[58:41] gift of love in the Lord Jesus Christ in
[58:44] his son Jesus Christ and he he gave
[58:47] himself not just at the birth when the
[58:49] Angels announc it but on the cross and
[58:52] he made the promise before he went to
[58:53] the Cross I'm going to send forth the
[58:56] comforter which is me I'm going to come
[58:58] back in the form of the Holy Ghost I'm
[59:00] going to come inside of you and I'm
[59:02] going to love just like I love when I
[59:05] was
[59:07] walking and I'll just say it like this I
[59:11] know God is the same yesterday
[59:13] forever I know I'm
[59:17] not if I'm wanting more this is the this
[59:21] is the beautiful
[59:23] thing God is not forcing any anybody to
[59:27] be his
[59:29] wife it's a desire that you got to
[59:32] have I want to be or it doesn't matter
[59:37] and when you want to be then you're
[59:38] willing to follow whatever the Bible
[59:41] says you'll open the Bible and you'll
[59:43] say God speak to me speak to me
[59:46] Lord and when he speaks to you if you
[59:49] ever deci Lord I want to do that I want
[59:51] to follow that but then what you're
[59:52] doing is you're opening the door for the
[59:54] Lord to choose you cuz many are called
[59:56] but few are chosen and we got to
[59:59] understand we're in this process that
[1:00:01] we're proving whether we're chosen we're
[1:00:04] literally proving whether we're chosen
[1:00:06] you know where the devil wants to come
[1:00:07] and says you're predestinated doesn't
[1:00:09] matter what you do right because we know
[1:00:11] what predestination is it takes you it
[1:00:13] looks forward it brings you to the
[1:00:16] end
[1:00:18] right and if if you're just staring at
[1:00:20] that but you're you don't care about
[1:00:22] what's happening here that's a Doctrine
[1:00:25] from the Devil
[1:00:31] predestination is supposed to comfort us
[1:00:33] when we fall and we make a mistake get
[1:00:36] back up and you know you got a desired
[1:00:38] Haven but it's not meant for you to do
[1:00:41] whatever you want to do and expect that
[1:00:43] you're going to be
[1:00:47] there so we got the promise here we need
[1:00:50] to we need to repent we need to get
[1:00:52] baptized but you know he doesn't say
[1:00:55] anything about obeying the the Bible
[1:00:57] nothing in this
[1:01:00] statement but he gives the Holy Ghost to
[1:01:02] them that obey
[1:01:03] him Peter said the same words he just
[1:01:06] said it in a different place but it
[1:01:09] gives me a better understanding of what
[1:01:11] it means to repent I'm not just
[1:01:14] repenting of my past sins I'm not
[1:01:16] repenting of something I did in the
[1:01:18] past I'm repenting of a nature that only
[1:01:22] wanted to live selfishly for myself and
[1:01:25] if if I Repent of that that means my
[1:01:27] nature I want to start living for
[1:01:30] God of course I'm going to start obeying
[1:01:33] the word of of course I'm going to start
[1:01:35] following through what the word says
[1:01:37] because I repented the way that I was
[1:01:40] told to
[1:01:44] repent I'm so thankful that the word is
[1:01:50] clear the gift of the Holy Ghost is the
[1:01:54] gift of per perfect
[1:02:00] love there's a real Revelation in this
[1:02:03] statement the gift of the Holy Ghost is
[1:02:07] the gift of perfect love I left this up
[1:02:09] here for one reason you notice where the
[1:02:11] holy spirit is it's right in between
[1:02:14] brotherly kindness and and love right
[1:02:16] here you cannot separate perfect love
[1:02:19] and the Holy Ghost when brother brandom
[1:02:22] goes beyond the curtain of time and he's
[1:02:25] describing this feeling that he never
[1:02:27] felt before in this Arena where
[1:02:30] everybody was coming up God bless you my
[1:02:32] precious brother and hugging and it was
[1:02:34] just like there was no jealousy
[1:02:36] everything was just absolutely perfect
[1:02:38] in that scenario and he said what is
[1:02:41] this who this is these are this is your
[1:02:44] this is your family this is these are
[1:02:46] all brandom like no they're not
[1:02:48] brandom's these are your
[1:02:50] converts who you won who you won to
[1:02:54] Jesus you won them to
[1:03:00] Jesus what is this that I'm feeling this
[1:03:03] is the Holy Ghost this thing that you're
[1:03:06] feeling that you're calling perfect love
[1:03:09] it's the Holy Ghost it's exactly what
[1:03:11] you
[1:03:12] preached when you preach the word you're
[1:03:15] preaching the Holy Ghost when you preach
[1:03:17] the word you're preaching perfect love
[1:03:19] it's up to the it's up to the believer
[1:03:22] to say I love God so much that I'm going
[1:03:25] to obey that word and when you obey when
[1:03:27] you can prove that you can obey the word
[1:03:30] that is you showing God that you
[1:03:31] perfectly love him and I'm going to tell
[1:03:33] you like this when you've got perfect
[1:03:34] love you have no problem loving others
[1:03:37] none none you don't struggle in loving
[1:03:41] somebody God don't struggle in loving
[1:03:47] somebody well I'm struggling get more of
[1:03:50] the Holy
[1:03:51] Ghost I got the Holy Ghost listen friend
[1:03:54] all you're going to do is confuse
[1:03:55] yourself just keep it real simple God is
[1:03:58] hidden Simplicity if you want to be to
[1:04:00] love more then just get more of the god
[1:04:02] inside of you it's that simple we don't
[1:04:05] got the Holy Ghost and then you know
[1:04:07] when brother bam says whatever you do go
[1:04:09] get perfect love lay aside everything
[1:04:11] what do he was really saying is get the
[1:04:13] Holy Ghost get the part that you don't
[1:04:16] have is what he was
[1:04:19] saying he says you come up to the Altar
[1:04:22] and you're praying and you're seeking
[1:04:23] the Holy Ghost and you think you got it
[1:04:25] did he say he said you stay there a
[1:04:28] little bit
[1:04:31] longer he says and then you stay there a
[1:04:33] little bit longer and something more
[1:04:35] comes and you feel you got it you know
[1:04:37] what he said he said you stay there a
[1:04:38] little bit
[1:04:39] longer
[1:04:43] did because there's more for us and we
[1:04:47] would all love if God would just come
[1:04:49] and fill us like boom like just fill us
[1:04:53] but he really wants to see a
[1:04:54] relationship
[1:04:57] he wants to see some he wants us to be
[1:05:00] willing to die out to our will that love
[1:05:03] it's a love okay let's let's go let's go
[1:05:06] out to dinner brother Stan you and I are
[1:05:07] going out to
[1:05:11] dinner and uh what restaurant would you
[1:05:14] want to go
[1:05:22] to how many times do we e
[1:05:27] we want something different than the
[1:05:28] other person we're
[1:05:33] with okay and when that other person
[1:05:36] says it's okay I we can do what you
[1:05:39] want you feel loved when that person
[1:05:42] does that you feel they love you just by
[1:05:46] the mere fact that they're willing to
[1:05:47] give up their
[1:05:48] will to do to do
[1:05:52] yours and this is how children show
[1:05:56] their love to their parents by obeying
[1:05:59] them by giving up their will to obey
[1:06:02] them I'll just say it like this God sees
[1:06:06] that when you're willing to give up your
[1:06:08] will to obey the Bible That's you
[1:06:10] showing God that you love
[1:06:12] him and if you obey his word you keep
[1:06:16] his word then Jesus said the father and
[1:06:20] I will come inside of you and make our
[1:06:23] AB bold
[1:06:25] not just come and anoint the outside not
[1:06:28] just make you know but Abode I want him
[1:06:30] to abide he abides he abides I want them
[1:06:33] to abide in me that means I got to make
[1:06:37] a greater sacrifice than just making it
[1:06:40] to church paying my ti or or whatever
[1:06:43] there's got to be a love affair A Love
[1:06:45] Affair we're not we're not uh Church
[1:06:50] robots we're living
[1:06:52] creatures God is is marrying someone
[1:06:55] that loves him amen
[1:06:59] amen so the gift of the Holy Ghost is
[1:07:02] the gift of perfect love when we don't
[1:07:04] want to miss this the key to receiving
[1:07:07] more of God's love which is the Holy
[1:07:10] Ghost is to love God more
[1:07:14] first please catch what I'm
[1:07:20] saying you're not going to want to obey
[1:07:22] the word if you don't love him because
[1:07:24] what he add ask you to do hurts it hurts
[1:07:28] your
[1:07:29] nature just a simple a simple thought
[1:07:33] here uh somebody hit you on the
[1:07:37] face and you want to straighten them out
[1:07:39] right
[1:07:41] away and Jesus says turn the
[1:07:46] cheek somebody want you to to to go a uh
[1:07:50] a mile you go a mile and they say hey
[1:07:52] thanks can you go one more oh come on
[1:07:54] what you're using in
[1:07:58] me so in order to obey the word of God
[1:08:01] you literally got to hurt your flesh
[1:08:04] crucify the flesh now when you do that
[1:08:07] God says I'm GNA love you a little bit
[1:08:12] more I'm going to love you a little bit
[1:08:14] more why or I'm gonna I'm G to
[1:08:16] extinguish I'm going to give I'm going
[1:08:18] to manifest I'm going to reoc a little
[1:08:20] bit more of my love to you because you
[1:08:23] just showed love to me
[1:08:26] isn't that beautiful seek ye first the
[1:08:29] kingdom of God and his righteousness and
[1:08:32] all other things will be added unto you
[1:08:35] if a man love me he will keep my words
[1:08:37] and my father will love him and we will
[1:08:39] come unto him and make our abold with
[1:08:44] him 1 John chapter 4 1 John chapter
[1:08:49] 4 the gift of the Holy Ghost is perfect
[1:08:53] love the gift of of the Holy Ghost is
[1:08:56] the gift of perfect love can't separate
[1:08:59] them cannot separate
[1:09:03] them I think it's a good indication
[1:09:06] whether we got enough Holy Ghost I'm off
[1:09:09] for saying I've got the Holy Ghost
[1:09:10] because justification is a part of the
[1:09:12] Holy
[1:09:15] Ghost but you notice the children of
[1:09:18] Israel didn't have very much to do to
[1:09:21] come out of
[1:09:23] Egypt there wasn't much of a battle God
[1:09:25] took care of the enemy set them free
[1:09:28] they walked out with all the treasures
[1:09:31] that was
[1:09:32] justification came out of the
[1:09:36] world it by faith it is a part of the
[1:09:39] Holy Ghost but in the wilderness where
[1:09:42] they were tried for 40
[1:09:45] years that's when God got grieved with
[1:09:47] the same people he brought out of
[1:09:49] Egypt he got grieved with them because
[1:09:51] he gave them all a chance to prove that
[1:09:55] they loved him and he says I will prove
[1:09:58] them to see if they will walk in my
[1:10:01] ways and many of them he said that he
[1:10:03] was not well pleased with many of
[1:10:06] them so I say today Saints we come to
[1:10:09] church we hear the word of God we don't
[1:10:12] want
[1:10:13] to to think we could take it or leave it
[1:10:16] there you know many people have come to
[1:10:17] church and left the church they came to
[1:10:19] the word they came when you come to the
[1:10:22] word you're coming to God Amen
[1:10:26] you're coming to to love you're coming
[1:10:27] to the you're coming to uh the Holy
[1:10:30] Spirit you're coming to perfect love and
[1:10:32] when you come and you do not you do not
[1:10:36] follow it that's why brother Braham said
[1:10:38] the evidence the true evidence that you
[1:10:40] got the Holy Ghost is you will receive
[1:10:42] the word for the
[1:10:44] hour because the Holy Spirit when he
[1:10:46] comes he leads and guides you into all
[1:10:48] truth and what is the truth we'll see
[1:10:49] here if I can get through this fast
[1:10:51] enough it is God's love being manifested
[1:10:54] in us that's what it is
[1:10:56] 1 John chapter 4 verse 8 says he that
[1:11:00] loveth
[1:11:01] not knoweth not God for God is
[1:11:11] love how many how many times people have
[1:11:15] they they believe they know God they got
[1:11:18] the Holy Ghost but they don't mind
[1:11:20] fighting they do not mind fighting don't
[1:11:23] mind arguing don't you go days go weeks
[1:11:26] go months don't want to talk don't want
[1:11:28] to shake hands but they got
[1:11:33] God it's not the god of the
[1:11:36] Bible the god of the Bible draws a
[1:11:39] bigger Circle I'm so glad God sent a
[1:11:41] prophet to tell us what the word
[1:11:44] means draw a bigger Circle love them
[1:11:47] anyways love them that persecute you
[1:11:50] that speak all manner of evil against
[1:11:52] you that speak ill of you love them love
[1:11:56] your
[1:11:57] enemy that is the same love that God
[1:12:02] gave
[1:12:03] us in Jesus Christ we all had such an
[1:12:08] evil nature in our own you know uh
[1:12:11] Ephesians 2 talks about if you want to
[1:12:13] pull that up Ephesians 2 I'll just read
[1:12:15] it off the screen verses 1 and two
[1:12:17] Ephesians chapter two verses and you
[1:12:21] have e quickened who were dead in
[1:12:23] trespasses and sins
[1:12:25] when ye when in uh in time past you
[1:12:29] walked according to the course of this
[1:12:31] world according to the prince of the
[1:12:33] power of the air the spirit that now
[1:12:35] worketh in the children of Disobedience
[1:12:37] what's verse three
[1:12:40] say among whom also we all had our
[1:12:43] conversations in time past in the lust
[1:12:45] of the flesh fulfilling the desires of
[1:12:47] the Flesh and of the Mind were by
[1:12:49] Nature the children of Wrath so when God
[1:12:53] came to us that's where who we were
[1:12:57] we were children or we did not really
[1:12:59] care about anything about our own
[1:13:03] will and so now God comes back in the
[1:13:06] power of the Holy Ghost and he fills our
[1:13:08] bodies we should be able to love others
[1:13:11] with the wrong nature I don't care if
[1:13:14] it's our our brother our sister our our
[1:13:16] mom our dad or our husband our wife uh
[1:13:19] you know Hypocrites in the church it
[1:13:21] doesn't matter we should be able to love
[1:13:24] them with the same love that God loved
[1:13:30] with 1 John chapter 4 verse 8 again he
[1:13:33] that loveth not knoweth not God for God
[1:13:36] is love in this was manifested the love
[1:13:40] of God towards
[1:13:42] us this was manif in this in this
[1:13:47] love was manifested the love of God
[1:13:50] towards us because that God sent his
[1:13:53] only begotten son into the world that we
[1:13:57] might live through
[1:14:00] him a pardon's not a pardon unless it's
[1:14:03] received a pardon Jesus died for the
[1:14:05] whole
[1:14:07] world that's why he said that
[1:14:17] um for God so love the world that he
[1:14:20] gave his only begotten son that
[1:14:21] whosoever believeth in him should not
[1:14:25] perish but have everlasting how many
[1:14:28] people started out to love God but never
[1:14:32] went all the
[1:14:33] way right they ended up perishing they
[1:14:36] started out right so we must continue on
[1:14:42] to move forward with God that we might
[1:14:45] live through
[1:14:47] him herein is love not that we loved God
[1:14:52] no we had a nature that didn't I didn't
[1:14:55] even care about
[1:14:58] God I'm I didn't care enough I didn't
[1:15:00] care about God enough to want to obey
[1:15:03] him let me just say it like that there
[1:15:05] was a time in my life that the only
[1:15:07] thing I cared about was
[1:15:11] me here in is is love not that we love
[1:15:15] God but that he loved us and he sent his
[1:15:18] son to be the propitiation for our sins
[1:15:21] which he did beloved if God so loved us
[1:15:25] we ought also to love one another
[1:15:31] amen now for whatever
[1:15:34] reason people want to be loved by God
[1:15:38] have all their needs met to be blessed
[1:15:40] to take care of all their problems but
[1:15:43] they don't focus at all about their
[1:15:46] responsibility of God living inside of
[1:15:49] them to be able to love somebody
[1:15:51] else you know this thing of I'm going to
[1:15:54] love you Dennis if you love
[1:15:56] me I will forgive you if you forgive me
[1:16:00] I will lay down my life for you if you
[1:16:02] lay down your life for me that is not
[1:16:06] God that's you scratch my back I'll
[1:16:08] scratch your back brother brand says
[1:16:10] I'll scratch your back even if you don't
[1:16:12] scratch mine that's what the love of God
[1:16:15] is you know to me to be able to let
[1:16:18] somebody not be perfect and love them to
[1:16:21] me is one of the greatest Joys to see
[1:16:24] man manifested in my
[1:16:27] life to be able to love somebody when
[1:16:30] they're not loving
[1:16:34] you because your your old nature didn't
[1:16:37] want to do that your old Nature's I'm
[1:16:39] I'm not we were best friend we're not
[1:16:41] best friends
[1:16:43] now I'm moving on to somebody
[1:16:47] else but when you got God on the inside
[1:16:51] then we can love one another the way he
[1:16:53] loved us amen
[1:16:55] the gift of the Holy Ghost is the gift
[1:16:57] of perfect
[1:17:03] love whatever you do he
[1:17:06] said make sure you get perfect
[1:17:13] love whatever you do make sure you get
[1:17:15] perfect love so now imagine if brother
[1:17:19] bam said this after he got beyond the
[1:17:21] curtain of time what if he would have
[1:17:22] said whatever you do make sure you got
[1:17:24] the Holy Ghost
[1:17:27] ghost well some people would be saying
[1:17:29] you know I spoke in
[1:17:30] tongues I got the Holy Ghost some people
[1:17:33] say I shouted I danced I cast out
[1:17:38] Devils uh God came down so much and he
[1:17:41] just shook me to
[1:17:44] pieces I know I got the Holy Ghost
[1:17:46] because one time for like three weeks I
[1:17:48] couldn't even just do anything I was
[1:17:49] just in like I was in another dimension
[1:17:56] but all if he would have just said that
[1:17:59] make sure you get the Holy
[1:18:00] Ghost then all people would have been
[1:18:02] doing is looking at what their evidence
[1:18:05] was of the Holy Ghost you understand
[1:18:07] what I'm saying but when he said make
[1:18:10] sure you get perfect love well I can
[1:18:12] test that every day sister
[1:18:14] Lori I can test that every day whether I
[1:18:17] got the goods or not it's not a One-Shot
[1:18:20] deal where the Holy Ghost come down and
[1:18:21] anointed me or something special
[1:18:23] happened at the altar but I have a
[1:18:25] chance every day to prove I've got
[1:18:27] perfect
[1:18:29] love and I just love that he gave us
[1:18:32] that to know and Jesus said the same
[1:18:34] thing by this Same Love shall all men
[1:18:37] know you're my disciples that you ready
[1:18:39] were
[1:18:40] connected when you can love just like I
[1:18:44] loved
[1:18:46] amen I love the
[1:18:50] word the thought that God was sending
[1:18:53] his gift of love back to us is
[1:18:57] incredible it it wasn't just a little
[1:19:00] bit of his love and it wasn't just a lot
[1:19:03] more of our love hey I'm going to fill
[1:19:05] you with more human
[1:19:06] love you know what I mean you're going
[1:19:08] to be able to you know really give all
[1:19:10] your uh your time to work in for all
[1:19:13] these organizations that that
[1:19:17] give
[1:19:18] no he sent back
[1:19:22] himself and the more more that you can
[1:19:25] believe God is in
[1:19:29] you the more you can manifest the love
[1:19:32] of
[1:19:35] God to live the life you live to love
[1:19:38] the
[1:19:40] unlovable to let somebody hurt you and
[1:19:43] still be able to love them as if they
[1:19:46] didn't hurt
[1:19:47] you that's awesome that's awesome
[1:19:51] because what does Humanity do I'll never
[1:19:53] forget you did that
[1:19:58] Peter said
[1:20:00] Jesus just just come on you know we we
[1:20:03] we forsook everything to follow you are
[1:20:05] you just talking like seven times or
[1:20:09] what I say not seven times I say seven
[1:20:13] times
[1:20:14] 70 that's what the love of God would do
[1:20:16] how do I know that to be true how many
[1:20:18] times has God forgiven you this
[1:20:21] week so you're going to tell me that God
[1:20:23] in inside of you you will not forgive
[1:20:25] somebody
[1:20:30] else no God is the same yesterday for
[1:20:33] that's what the prophet came to tell us
[1:20:35] he is the same today in us not just the
[1:20:38] same on a platform that can heal
[1:20:41] amen not just so that he can do
[1:20:44] discernment but that he can actually
[1:20:46] live inside of a human being and live
[1:20:48] the same life that Christ
[1:20:50] lived because you know brother R didn't
[1:20:52] go around speaking Scrolls in existence
[1:20:54] 25 times one
[1:21:00] time and it was at God's will same with
[1:21:03] hady right at God's
[1:21:09] will it was enough to show us that the
[1:21:11] Life of Christ was behind the word that
[1:21:13] he was speaking and what is God really
[1:21:16] looking for in us to make it on the
[1:21:18] other side to go through raptured or
[1:21:19] what is he looking for for us be to
[1:21:21] perform a lot of Miracles
[1:21:24] no he wants to be able to say there's
[1:21:26] there's my bride who loves my
[1:21:28] word that's who I'm
[1:21:31] choosing that's who I'm choosing the one
[1:21:34] that loves my
[1:21:35] word St John chapter
[1:21:39] 13:31 now this is really this is really
[1:21:42] ironic because I have half the pages
[1:21:43] that I normally have when I have half
[1:21:45] the
[1:21:47] pages and and I'm still not getting
[1:21:49] through a quarter of the
[1:21:52] Pages St John 13:31 therefore when he
[1:21:56] was gone out Jesus said now is the son
[1:21:59] of man glorified and God is glorified in
[1:22:03] him this is or he's going to be
[1:22:06] crucified if God be glorified in him God
[1:22:09] shall also glorify him in himself and
[1:22:12] shall straightway glorify him little
[1:22:15] children yet a little while I am with
[1:22:17] you you seek me uh you shall seek me and
[1:22:21] as I said unto the Jews whether whether
[1:22:24] I go you cannot come so now I say unto
[1:22:29] you you can't come you can't come where
[1:22:32] I'm at you can't come where this love is
[1:22:35] at he says a new commandment I give unto
[1:22:41] you that you love one another as I have
[1:22:44] loved you that you also love one
[1:22:48] another and by this shall all men know
[1:22:51] you're my disciples if you have this
[1:22:53] love one for another now how if somebody
[1:22:57] went to any any place to work and they
[1:23:01] told you to do something that only okay
[1:23:05] I'm going to do this right now okay so
[1:23:07] brother s's going to go to trusted to
[1:23:09] tomorrow and he's going to work now I if
[1:23:11] if I give brother Stan a commandment I
[1:23:16] want you to make sure you pay all the
[1:23:21] bills well he's not on the check
[1:23:23] register he can't sign a
[1:23:31] check he would have to be given power to
[1:23:35] fulfill my command Jesus gives a command
[1:23:38] for us to love like he loved well we
[1:23:41] can't do it in oursel and we can't go
[1:23:44] where he's going he has to come and live
[1:23:46] inside of us for us to fulfill the
[1:23:49] will it's not good enough to say I've
[1:23:51] got God I've got the Holy Ghost get away
[1:23:53] from that start holding yourself
[1:23:56] accountable every day am I loving the
[1:23:57] way he loves can I forgive like he
[1:24:01] forgives can I not think evil the way he
[1:24:04] thinks evil that he doesn't think you
[1:24:06] know what I'm saying can I not think
[1:24:09] evil like the way God does not think
[1:24:10] evil the love of God thinketh no evil we
[1:24:13] spend time just letting things stir in
[1:24:15] our mind and say what we want to say
[1:24:17] talk about what we want to talk and then
[1:24:20] and we're still a Christian we're still
[1:24:23] Christlike we're holding ourselves to
[1:24:25] our
[1:24:26] standard instead of the Bible
[1:24:29] standard and this gift that God gave
[1:24:32] this gift of love that he
[1:24:35] gave he didn't give
[1:24:38] it he didn't give it just for himself he
[1:24:41] gave it so it could come and live inside
[1:24:43] of
[1:24:44] us he really wants to
[1:24:47] see us live like
[1:24:50] him can you imagine having a child
[1:24:53] bringing up their child and you tell
[1:24:54] them you don't put your shoes here this
[1:24:56] is what you do you take your plates here
[1:24:58] you take out the garbage you you vacuum
[1:25:00] you sweep you clean your room you do all
[1:25:02] these things you ask your children to do
[1:25:04] all these things do you does a parent
[1:25:06] really say well I don't really care if
[1:25:09] you do them or
[1:25:10] not no a parent wants to see that their
[1:25:14] children are just like
[1:25:19] them God wants to see us just like him
[1:25:22] to be able to love like he
[1:25:26] loves he wants about to look down and
[1:25:28] say this is my son my daughter in whom
[1:25:31] I'm well pleased I'm well pleased to
[1:25:34] dwell in them now understand that Jesus
[1:25:38] had the fullness of the godhead we only
[1:25:40] have a portion but I do believe that
[1:25:44] that if God told
[1:25:46] us to love one another like he did then
[1:25:50] I believe that God would make the means
[1:25:51] for us to do
[1:25:53] it he would never tell us to do
[1:25:55] something that he would not give us the
[1:25:56] means to do it God Is Not An unfair God
[1:26:00] he's not
[1:26:02] unjust which means it's there for our
[1:26:05] taking but God is wanting us to see us
[1:26:09] Get Down On Our Knees humble ourselves
[1:26:11] and say God I need more of you than what
[1:26:13] I have and it's through that process
[1:26:17] that you're showing your your heart to
[1:26:19] God and God says you just keep seeking
[1:26:22] me you shall seek me and you shall find
[1:26:25] me when you search for me with all your
[1:26:27] heart he gives you a word to obey and
[1:26:29] you leave church and you you leave
[1:26:31] church with a word that you didn't have
[1:26:33] when you came and you want to follow
[1:26:35] that
[1:26:36] word and you just do that service after
[1:26:39] service every time you read the Bible
[1:26:40] you have this hunger God I want to know
[1:26:43] you more I want to be like you and I'm
[1:26:45] telling you God will fill you with the
[1:26:47] portion of the Holy Ghost that will
[1:26:49] literally love
[1:26:51] everyone it's real it's real it's real
[1:26:54] it's real anybody that's has ever
[1:26:58] experienced that love you know it's
[1:27:02] real and you wouldn't trade it for a
[1:27:04] thing you wouldn't trade it for a thing
[1:27:06] because it is a power that you've never
[1:27:09] experienced now God has used us he's
[1:27:12] used us he's used our prayers to pray
[1:27:14] for others and and people have received
[1:27:17] whether it be healing or whatever that
[1:27:19] they were praying for through prayer and
[1:27:22] that is a wonderful feeling it really is
[1:27:26] but nothing can be compared nothing can
[1:27:28] be compared to when God is so strong
[1:27:31] inside of you that you literally can
[1:27:33] love your
[1:27:35] enemy Jesus said be ye perfect even as
[1:27:39] my Father in Heaven is
[1:27:41] perfect that that perfectness is is like
[1:27:48] Abraham coming to completion with the
[1:27:50] manifestation okay I'm willing to give
[1:27:52] up Isaac that was the same complete
[1:27:56] Pinnacle that he could get to that was
[1:27:58] called perfect
[1:27:59] love now I don't you know I don't
[1:28:04] believe is God's going to you know take
[1:28:07] all of us and everybody's going to get
[1:28:09] hit on the face like 13 times tomorrow
[1:28:12] to have to prove it I don't think it's
[1:28:14] going to work like that I don't think
[1:28:17] any we're going to get phone calls and
[1:28:18] we're going to be asked to go 16 miles
[1:28:20] for somebody but the case is we're going
[1:28:24] to going to have
[1:28:26] opportunities continuously to prove that
[1:28:29] we are loving like God loves and we want
[1:28:32] to make sure that we're able to pass
[1:28:35] that test and if we can't we find oursel
[1:28:39] coming short then you just get more
[1:28:41] sincere with God say God I need more of
[1:28:44] the Holy Ghost I need more of the Holy
[1:28:47] Ghost you're saying is I need more of
[1:28:49] the love of
[1:28:51] God now the whole the love of God is
[1:28:54] transferred to us through the power of
[1:28:57] the Holy Spirit Romans 5:5 says the love
[1:29:00] of God is shed abroad in our heart by
[1:29:03] the Holy Ghost which is given onto us so
[1:29:07] there you go you cannot have the Holy
[1:29:09] Ghost without having the love of God
[1:29:12] that word shed abroad means to pour
[1:29:15] forth to spill forth to gush out to pour
[1:29:19] out to run
[1:29:21] out so you got the Holy Ghost you know
[1:29:23] what's coming out the love of God
[1:29:26] right that's why you know people that
[1:29:28] say they got they got the Holy Ghost but
[1:29:31] they can't show love it don't mean a
[1:29:33] whole lot to me it don't it just doesn't
[1:29:36] it doesn't even draw my
[1:29:40] attention because that is not where
[1:29:42] Jesus said all men shall know you're my
[1:29:44] disciples it's through the power of
[1:29:47] being able to love the way that God
[1:29:50] loves so when we pour out unconditional
[1:29:53] love like God does does to others others
[1:29:56] are going to know we're going to be
[1:29:58] different than anyone else people are
[1:30:00] going to know that we're different we're
[1:30:02] a different class of people there's not
[1:30:04] there many people that you can just talk
[1:30:06] behind their back and they're still
[1:30:07] going to love you after they know about
[1:30:08] it there ain't too many people that can
[1:30:10] do that it's a truth you want to avoid
[1:30:14] them you want to get away you feel
[1:30:18] uncomfortable but you know love is the
[1:30:21] strongest power on the planet and it
[1:30:23] does not not scared of
[1:30:25] anything in fact perfect love casts out
[1:30:28] all
[1:30:28] fear it'll just cast it
[1:30:32] out what are we going to be afraid
[1:30:36] tribulation
[1:30:38] famine people leaving
[1:30:41] us losing somebody's
[1:30:43] friendship what shall separate us from
[1:30:46] the love of God nothing and all these
[1:30:48] things were more than
[1:30:51] conquerors nothing can separate
[1:30:54] from the love of God brother brandom
[1:30:57] described perfect love when he describes
[1:30:59] the situation with the bow with the
[1:31:02] maniac with the bees with the
[1:31:05] pum God's purpose for us is to be one
[1:31:08] with him in
[1:31:10] love and he says here he prayed for you
[1:31:12] and I here today in John
[1:31:15] 17:22 he says and the glory which thou
[1:31:17] Gest me I give them that they may be one
[1:31:21] even as we are
[1:31:22] one in in i in them and thou in me that
[1:31:27] they may be perfect that they may be
[1:31:30] made perfect in one see we're in the
[1:31:34] process of being made
[1:31:36] perfect we hear the word we receive it
[1:31:40] it becomes a part of us we go out and
[1:31:42] live it tomorrow something that we
[1:31:43] didn't live today that's the process of
[1:31:46] being made perfect in one and that the
[1:31:50] world may know that thou has sent me and
[1:31:54] has and has loved them as thou has loved
[1:32:00] me so God wants us to be just like him
[1:32:04] to be able to Manifest this love
[1:32:06] unconditionally and I'll say like this
[1:32:08] take take the people that you've had the
[1:32:10] hardest problem
[1:32:12] with and start
[1:32:15] working on loving
[1:32:18] them because it's easy to love those
[1:32:22] that love you don't the
[1:32:25] publicans
[1:32:26] right I mean I'll do you a favor you do
[1:32:30] me one do something for somebody that
[1:32:33] cannot do something for
[1:32:35] you do something for somebody who cannot
[1:32:39] love you the way you love them do
[1:32:41] something for that person that does not
[1:32:43] possess enough Holy Ghost to forgive you
[1:32:46] do something for them because in that
[1:32:51] they see God
[1:32:54] they don't see you they see
[1:32:59] God and that gives them a chance that
[1:33:03] gives them a chance to say God I want
[1:33:05] what I just seen manifested in front of
[1:33:07] me I'll tell you when love is been
[1:33:10] manifested to me it has literally melted
[1:33:13] me into a
[1:33:17] puddle Jesus said how be it when the
[1:33:19] spirit of Truth is come he will guide
[1:33:23] you into all
[1:33:26] Truth Now what is the truth he told us
[1:33:29] to love others the truth when he the
[1:33:32] spirit of truth will come he will lead
[1:33:33] and guide you in all truth well what is
[1:33:35] truth Jesus said I am the way the truth
[1:33:36] and the life he is the truth and what
[1:33:38] did truth say when truth comes into our
[1:33:41] heart he said love others as I have
[1:33:44] loved
[1:33:45] you love others as I have loved
[1:33:50] you John 21:15 I'm going to try to go
[1:33:53] through this real quick because Jesus is
[1:33:55] instructing Peter here how to give the
[1:33:57] gift of
[1:33:59] love and if you just really you know if
[1:34:01] you really get into this the end of the
[1:34:03] message right here then you know I'll
[1:34:05] let you out on
[1:34:10] time John Chap 21:15 and so when they
[1:34:14] had D Jesus saith to Simon this is now
[1:34:17] after Jesus had died uh Resurrected
[1:34:25] uh and Jesus saith to Simon Peter Simon
[1:34:29] son of Jonas lovest thou me more than
[1:34:33] these and he saith unto him yay Lord
[1:34:36] thou knowest that I love
[1:34:39] thee and he said unto him feed my
[1:34:45] Lambs in other words don't feed your own
[1:34:47] face don't stuff your own face don't
[1:34:49] worry about yourself it's not all about
[1:34:51] you church is not about you church is
[1:34:54] about you to find out where you're at
[1:34:56] with God but church is not just to be
[1:34:58] about you you're supposed to take what
[1:35:01] you have and part of the body helps the
[1:35:03] other the body that's like me saying you
[1:35:04] go home and you take a bath and shower
[1:35:06] and don't use anything to do it we're a
[1:35:09] body we're body
[1:35:10] Ministry so feed the Lambs love give
[1:35:14] yourself love like I have loved you what
[1:35:17] did Jesus do for three and a half years
[1:35:19] he fed his disciples he taught them
[1:35:23] and now it's all over and he's getting
[1:35:25] ready to go and he looks at Peter he
[1:35:27] says do you do you love
[1:35:30] me because it's all about love the whole
[1:35:33] thing is about
[1:35:36] love and he's talking to the the one
[1:35:38] who's the discerner of the thoughts and
[1:35:40] Tents of his heart and he says yes I
[1:35:42] know th know that I love you you don't
[1:35:45] even have to ask me something like that
[1:35:46] you already
[1:35:48] know he wasn't trying to figure out
[1:35:51] Peter's intelligence
[1:35:54] he was trying to get a point
[1:35:56] across if you think you love
[1:35:59] me then take your love and go help
[1:36:05] somebody go help somebody to
[1:36:08] me because they're my
[1:36:11] lamb they're in a
[1:36:14] condition that they need help because if
[1:36:17] they weren't in a condition to lead help
[1:36:19] then they could feed
[1:36:21] themselves right they would they would
[1:36:24] be strong enough to know that God's in
[1:36:26] the word and I'm going to get in the
[1:36:28] word and I'm going to just live the word
[1:36:30] but you know somebody that can't feed
[1:36:33] themselves they're not they're not
[1:36:35] strong enough to feed themselves they're
[1:36:39] weak we have a chance to prove our love
[1:36:42] to God by feeding the Lambs de feeding
[1:36:46] those that are are weaker he Sai to him
[1:36:48] again the second time Simon son of Jonas
[1:36:51] lovest thou me and he saith yay Lord
[1:36:53] thou knowest I love thee he and he saith
[1:36:56] unto him feed my sheep and he saith unto
[1:36:59] him the third time Simon son of Jonas
[1:37:03] lovest thou me can you imagine if
[1:37:06] somebody said something ask you the same
[1:37:09] question three
[1:37:10] times it would probably grieve you
[1:37:13] right if they were serious well it
[1:37:15] grieved Peter Peter was grieved because
[1:37:18] he said un him the third time lovest
[1:37:19] thou
[1:37:21] me for he said unto him Lord thou
[1:37:23] knowest all things thou knowest that I
[1:37:25] love thee and Jesus said unto him feed
[1:37:28] my
[1:37:30] sheep what a
[1:37:34] like he was so Peter was so interested
[1:37:37] in what he was interested in hey what's
[1:37:39] going to happen to John what's going to
[1:37:41] go on with him what's going to happen in
[1:37:43] his life tell me his
[1:37:48] future what is it to you Peter it's like
[1:37:50] none of your beeswax it's none of your
[1:37:54] business you love me we got a
[1:37:57] relationship it's between me and you
[1:37:59] feed my
[1:38:00] sheep I've called you to live for others
[1:38:05] to love others as I have loved
[1:38:08] you John
[1:38:10] 3:16 we know St John 316 and this is 1
[1:38:14] John 3:16 this is to us how hereby
[1:38:18] perceive we the love of
[1:38:21] God because he laid down his life for us
[1:38:24] we ought to lay down our lives for one
[1:38:29] another this is the gift that God gave
[1:38:31] us the gift of love that God gave us he
[1:38:34] wants us to go give it to
[1:38:36] others May our season be
[1:38:39] filled with the true gift that God meant
[1:38:43] it to be which is his love and I know
[1:38:47] that it's just part of life to get
[1:38:51] involved in in in in giving is part of
[1:38:54] just showing your your love our our our
[1:38:57] our our our our human love we want our
[1:39:00] our kids and our family members and you
[1:39:02] know we you know we
[1:39:05] just we we we get a list Elizabeth sends
[1:39:10] us a list and all the things you know
[1:39:12] that the kids want and you know we want
[1:39:14] to make him happy right so we get them
[1:39:17] we don't get them things they don't want
[1:39:20] right I mean that's a wonderful thing
[1:39:24] but I'm talking about something that God
[1:39:27] gave himself his
[1:39:30] love to take that gift that God has
[1:39:33] given you and share it share it the way
[1:39:36] that he intended it to be shared not
[1:39:38] through not just through human uh
[1:39:43] capability but say God come into my
[1:39:45] heart feel me soul full of you that I
[1:39:48] just I can love like you and other
[1:39:50] others will able to see that you're
[1:39:51] still alive
[1:39:53] that you know they they may not
[1:39:55] recognize you in certain things in the
