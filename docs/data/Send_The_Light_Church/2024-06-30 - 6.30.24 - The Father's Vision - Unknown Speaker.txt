wonderful thank you Lord thank you Lord Jesus amen what an honor to praise the Lord Jesus one time said you don't know what you're worshiping you don't even know who you're worshiping it is a privilege to know who we're worshiping amen God bless you this morning so good to be in the house of the Lord amen amen turn with me if you would to Proverbs chapter 29 we're just going to read one verse of scripture there amen certainly appreciate our time of worship this morning and may we just continue worshiping in the in the Fellowship of the word amen good to see um our our our brother Charlie here today he's it's this this man has hardly no strength and we got to pray for him um that God would just bless his body bless the doctors with leadership to help him uh because it just took everything he had just to get here this morning and it shows his his love for God and he he said yesterday that he wants to get baptized so we're so thankful for that amen and let's continue to pray for him his wife amen um before we begin reading here in Proverbs 29 let's look to the author this word amen in a word of prayer father we thank thee that you have given us eternal life and it was through this word that you preserved Through the Ages this Eternal Word where we found eternal life how to receive it Lord and Lord we just thank you our hearts today that you have kept us all these years amen you've kept us uh and you said nothing can SE can separate us and we're we're just grateful for that Lord we don't have to look very far in the course of a day or our lives to to to not see many things Lord that you have blessed us with and we thank you for each and every one of them this morning Lord we just thank you now for the ministry of the word we want to thank you in advance and just ask you to please Lord pour out Revelation to each of us today Father we want to be drawing Closer to You by way of Revelation take away our our knowledge our understanding our ideas Lord may we just be open to your mind this morning Lord we thank you for these things in the name of Jesus Christ we pray amen amen Proverbs 29 Verse 18 reads where there is no vision the people perish but he that keepeth the law happy is he amen God bless you may be seated this morning we want to entitle this message the father's Vision but it's a little bit we're take a little bit different view than what we would normally take this scripture with and for a subject walking in the father's Vision uh Jesus said this when he was talking about the coming of the Lord he said blessed is that that servant whom his Lord when he cometh shall find so doing so at the coming of the Lord God bless you Sister Judy at the coming of the lord we want to be doing what God wants us to be doing amen and I believe that is Walking In God's Eternal Vision that he had from the beginning and now this vision is so important because if there is no vision if people don't have a vision if we don't see God's Vision then then people are going to perish so this Vision has to be to be made known God has always wanted a family amen that's why he made man in his own image the Angels wasn't good enough and he didn't want just any old family but one that would walk in his character act like him handle obstacles and situations just the way he does Bible says that God is love so I believe that God wants his family to be a family of love God wanted to be a Jehovah father that would be able to provide everything that his family needed unfortunately uh with man being made in God's image and everything being perfect there was just attributes swelled up in God that he would never be able to express so he had to allow man to fall and man who was uh the the highest form the highest form that he had created amen uh became the most needful creature after the fall right and that opened the door for for for the father to be a a savior a redeemer A Healer a counselor a provider for his family to direct and lead to correct his family to come Comfort them to discipline them that they could walk together and be a family and grow and mature as as we all have had children and we want to see the same thing we don't we certainly don't never wanted our our children to to to go to to somebody else and say you know my father couldn't really handle it and I really I I see you handling being more of a father than my father no father would ever want to hear that right so it was in God's desire that he would be able to fulfill every need that we could ever have now because of of the Fall men began to be born out of the will of God they were born of another seed in other words it wasn't by the will of God but it was mixed in with man's will so it became a high-bred seed it wasn't by the spoken word of God like he created everything else and it's through this perverted Act that the the will of man was born as it were separated from God there was a separation and that is why man has to become born again if a man does not become Born Again correctly by the by if I could say it like this by the Spoken Word by God willing it by God speaking it we cannot enter the kingdom of God and I'll say it like this we our nature cannot be changed unless God wills it there's nothing inside of a man to to change his nature he can't even tame his own tongue it takes the power of God in a man to change him God provided a way he went to Calvary number one first to pay for our sins amen and then he sent back the Holy Ghost Upon Us in that Holy Ghost is what changes our nature from being worldly to being Godly amen now out in the world God is the only one that knows who's who not everybody belongs to God not everybody is a part of the family of God but God has been gathering together in every age his his elect uh through each Age and and this is the the vision that God has had and we see it here in Ephesians we're going to be a lot in Ephesians today this morning Ephesians chapter 1 vers vers 10 says that in the dispensation of the fullness of time he might gather together in one all things in Christ that's right both which are in heaven those that have gone on before now they're in heaven right which and which are on earth those that's us and those that have not yet come in even in him there's the criteria his family is all into Christ amen no Jesus has been searching for his family through every age and he's been converting them to his own nature Matthew 4: 18 and Jesus walking by the Sea of Galilee he saw two Brethren Simon called Peter and Andrew his brother they were casting a net into the sea for they were Fishers amen and he saith unto them follow me and I will make you Fishers of Men and straightway they left their Nets and followed him now there there wasn't really anything more to it than that but what's so ironic about this is that there was already something inside of Peter and Andrew that represented or that rep recognized the call when it was spoken amen there was no need they didn't say well Jesus show me your credentials you have to prove to me this is the right thing for me to do before I follow you you need to show me a sign or I need to go home and I need to talk to my family or talk to my neighbors or talk to those I've Got Confidence in first and and see what they have to say and get their opinions before I make this decision no the Bible says they Dro their Nets and straightway they followed him and the only thing he said was follow me wow what was he doing he was gathering together those that belonged to him amen most people think that he would have been they would have been insane to do that but there was something in already inside of them a spiritual seed that recognized truth truth and that is the voice of God truth is the voice of God when pilate was trying to figure out who Jesus was Jesus said to him in John 18:37 to this end was I born for this cause came I into the world that I should bear witness unto the truth and every one that is of the truth heareth my voice that's right I just love that little scripture everyone that is of the truth heareth my voice amen and if you're not of the truth it's just going to be well that's just your opinion amen that's just what you think I me I just go find another church I I'll just believe you know there's so many churches out there with so many different beliefs Jesus said in John chapter 10 he that he calleth his own Sheep by name Peter Andrew John Ben Ron Charlie Mike he calleth them by name amen and leadth them out and the Sheep follow him for they know his voice who taught that to him inside there's a bearing of witness and he he said in John 10:16 and other sheep I have which are not of this fold them also I must bring in and they shall hear my voice and there shall be one fold and one Shepherd so he's gathering together this is the vision of God to gather his family together amen there's already a connection between God and his people it's a spiritual seed inside of them and they recognize the voice of the call of God's call and they just they just follow Jesus said many are called but few are chosen so everybody gets a chance but only a few are chosen in other words there's only a few that straightway drop their Nets leave their Pro their profession leave their family and they start following Christ with all their heart amen Peter heard the call from Heaven man okay let's follow on Matthew 4:21 and going on from then he saw other two Brethren James the son of zebede and John his brother in a ship with Zebedee their father mending their Nets doing their job it was their business and he called them and immediately they immediately left the ship and their father and followed him amen the call was so strong that they left their family they left their business and they started following amen wow that's strong there's something inside of these men that responded from the call that was from heaven and what that was was there was a part a small part of Heaven inside of them already they just didn't know it amen they didn't know it and we didn't know it either Matthew 9:9 and as Jesus passed forth from then he saw a man named Matthew sitting at the receipt of customs and he saith unto him follow me and he rose and followed him notice in these incidences there's nothing going on about let's talk about this I'm just not so weirdo that's just going to follow somebody amen I just love that I love that you know we are not weird we just know where we came from we just know who we belong to Luke 527 I like how it said here and after these things he went forth and saw a Publican named Levi sitting at the receit of customs and he said unto me follow me and he left all I love this way he left all rose up and followed followed him then he went home and had a great feast invited more publicans to to to help out and uh and we're coming in for another we're going to have two of these babies we're we're we're spreading we're spreading we want to spread it more twice as much amen all right so we can't get them with these two and this you know it's just meant for us that's all I can say John 1:43 the day following Jesus would go forth into Galilee and findeth Phillip and saith unto him follow me wow I just want you to think when God called you when God first spoke to you he's hid in Simplicity and revealed in the same amen there was a woman of Samaria and Jesus said I must needs go by Samaria he had a burden to give her the gospel now this woman as we know she had a bad reputation because she had a a number of different husbands in her life but yet there was a seed inside of her and when the gospel was ministered to her she recognized and she followed in fact she was so happy that she just had to go tell others amen come see a man that told me all that I've ever done amen all these had a representation of Truth inside of them and everyone that is of the truth Hearth my voice Jesus said Paul was another one the Bible says he was born out of due season but this was a man that you wouldn't think he was a a real loving Christian because at one time he was against the church he persecuted the church he wasted it he was he was about killing he was a man that had more education uh but yet he didn't even know God he really didn't have a personal relationship with God but he knew all these scriptures but he still didn't know them one day Paul heard the real voice of Jesus and his life was never the same but you know what Paul had to do like everybody else that we read he had to forsake all the Bible says that he suffered the loss of all things to follow Christ God's vision and eternal purpose in the dispensation of the fullness of times he might gather together in one all things in Christ both which are in heaven and which are on earth even in him and this is what God is still doing today he's Gathering his elect amen I think about the ones that he gathered in the first church age that you know they they didn't have all the light that we had but yet they're just as much Bride As we are amen the next age there was a little bit more light so God required a little bit more light and every age there became more light and God required of of them and in this age all the light is required amen all the light so we have to we have to live by every word of God we got to love every word of God we got to want to see that every word manifested inside of us now we are in the fullness of times we're at the end he gathered you and I out of this world we heard him say follow me and we forsook our dreams I had dreams we we forsook our plans our Ambitions what we were going to do oh I I I have a list of things that I was going to do and I also have a list of things that I was never going to do and they just didn't you know God didn't really care about any of that right because we are not born to our will anymore we've been born by the will of God and that's what becomes important to the Christian just like his disciples they recklessly abandoned everything we recklessly abandoned everything to follow God Amen there was no debate we didn't ask for proof we just dropped what we were doing and we started following Christ because something inside of us and and God is still Gathering his family together now sad part is that not everyone who wants to serve God is willing to forsake all they're not willing to forsake their will their life to follow Christ and they've been tricked in thinking that's okay and that's why we have so many different denominations out there so many different ideas out there but if you think Lucifer tricked that Fallen Angels he tricked Eve he tricked the children of Israel all of them were tricked by thinking that they could still have eternal life without doing the will of God that's the truth but you can't this is what Jesus said in Mark 8:34 and when he had called the people together unto him with his disciples also as he said unto them whosoever will come come after me let him deny himself take up his cross and follow me I believe when he called his disciples that they did that it didn't say it but they did it the proof is we got the the Bible we got we got we know what happened afterwards and Jesus said for whosoever will save his life he's going to lose it but if you just give up your life for the gospel for my sake and the gospels the same shall save it amen so that's the only way to be a part of the family of God is to forsake all that you have and follow God the only way and I know those are like hard words but you know what I'd rather have the truth than be comforted by some lie now everyone has a chance to hear the gospel at least once and here's an example in Matthew in Mark chap 10 of someone who had a strong desire for salvation but he wasn't willing to pay the price that God was requiring and when he had gone forth into the way there came one running and kneeled to him and asked him good Master what shall I do that I might inherit eternal life and Jesus said unto them why callest thou me good there's none uh good but one that is God Jesus said you know the Commandments do not commit adultery do not kill do not steal do not bear false witness defraud not honor thy father and thy mother and he answered and said Toto him master all these have I uh I've done these things since I was a young boy and Jesus beholding him now notice this he loved him he loved him so he's looking at him he's full of love and you would you would think we would look at our children who would answer that we would say good job we would say good job but not our heavenly father because his love is greater than our love Jesus behold and loved him and said unto him one thing thou lackest go thy way sell whatsoever thou has give it to the poor and thou shalt have Treasures in Heaven and come take up the cross and follow me man can I just follow you why do I got to go do why do I got to give this up why do I got to deny myself why do I got to take up the cross can I just follow you I got I want to I want to come to church I want to follow you and I want to go home and I want to live my life the requirement was forsake everything down to the one last thing and God sees clearly our life he sees if anything is standing in the way of following him now look what verse 22 says and he was sad at this saying and went away grieved notice grieved for he had great possessions he was bothered at the preaching that day he did not like the sermon it did not encourage him he went home discouraged instead of instead of hearing from the pastor oh you've been good you been doing all the Commandments from your youth good job I'm so glad I know my Jesus his nature and and how as many as I love I rebuke and chasen he said all that he had to do was give up one thing the one thing that stood between him and God but you know what it takes free more agency he had to be willing to do it God could have God could have took it God could have took all his riches away made them poor but he didn't see many are called but few are chosen the call goes out to many amen and all that the father's given me will come he will not lose a one but no matter how what we do how much we try if we're not willing to do all that God wants us to do how can we be a part of the family of God and I know this may seem strong but it's important God will not lose one of his family members it's not that I would want to judge this Rich Young Ruler that he wasn't part of the family of God I don't judge people whether they are or they're not but it's simple it's really really simple Jesus said you'll know them by their fruits it's that real hard to figure out if you see a person give up everything and follow God that's a good sign amen if you see somebody that's just trying to go halfway all the time only give part I'm telling you that's danger that's dangerous you can't end up doing that Paul said in 2 Timothy 2:19 nevertheless the foundation of God stand sure having this seal the Lord knoweth them that are his he knows his family amen and let every one of those family members that say that they're a part of the family of God let him depart from iniquity amen there's no other options for the family of God am now there was a group of Believers disciples actually and they were following Jesus's Inner Circle for a great time and one day after the service they got offended by the word that had been preached just like the Rich Young Ruler there were 70 disciples and they walked away away from Jesus because of one sermon am John 6 66 you know the mark of the beast from that time many of his disciples went back and walked no more with him then Jesus said unto the 12 his family that he had chosen are you going to walk away also then Peter answered Lord to whom whom shall we go thou has has the words of eternal life now if you don't forsake everything for God the thing that you don't forsake becomes your God and you will never you will never be able to follow God into the kingdom because the requirement that God has is him and and only him now we got to work God wants us to have nice things God wants us to enjoy but God wants to be first God wants to be first he always wants to be first amen many will plead their cause the Bible says many will come to him in that day but they didn't forsake all to follow him the bottom line it's the requirement of God isn't the church's requirement it's God's requirement now the problem told us that these disciples who left that didn't have the understanding brother bandam said that Jesus's own disciples didn't have the understanding what he meant in that sermon but they knew it was true because whatever God says is true so just because we don't understand something it doesn't mean it's not true what's important is that you believe what Jesus said you believe the word of God you believe what's being said they had a representation of truth from Heaven already inside of them God is gathering together his whole family and I'm so glad that God gave us a part of Heaven think about your family members who haven't come in who don't see it who who didn't see it we are for fortunate that there's something inside of us that's much deeper than just a good churchgoer than someone that just knows the scriptures or someone that just uh has had many experiences with God I'd rather have no experiences with God don't misunderstand this I'd rather have no outside manifestations with God and have representation on the inside because that keeps me connected to a a real relationship with God on a daily basis my thoughts my intents I'm I'm caring about the way I'm carrying myself I I want to represent him now the book of Ephesians was written as we know to a more mature church right that's right am to me it depicts the father's Vision that he wants his church family to walk in you get time read the book of Ephesians it's it's not very many chapters right but it helps us to see the vision we don't have a a lot of time here that's the only thing about church it you know there's never enough time you know in church so we're going to get as far as we can with this but the key is that we really need to be in Christ not know him not have experiences but to be in him and to have him in me and that day you'll know that I'm in you and you in me me it's a Oneness amen if there's anything that we should be doing is praying for more of the Holy Ghost amen we don't want to be in a man-made Church man-made ideas opinions theology we just want a real relationship with God Ephesians chapter 3:9 tells us and to make all men see what is the Fellowship of the mystery which from the beginning of the world has been hidden God who created All Things by Jesus Christ and drop down to verse 11 according to his eternal purpose which he purposed in Christ Jesus our lord so Eternal purpose that mean it didn't have no beginning it doesn't have no end this thing goes way back and it's going way ahead it's got to be pretty important to God brother Bram said in the Samaran Church age he said the heart purpose the Eternal purpose of God was to take a bride of his own choosing that was that and that purpose was in himself and and being Eternal was decreed from the foundation of the world Amen he wanted a wife he wanted a family this is on the mind of God Amen when we're working when we're at the store when we're vacationing this is is on the mind of God Amen verse 14 for this cause I bow my knees unto the father of the Lord Jesus Christ of whom the whole family in Heaven and Earth is named praise the Lord praise the Lord the whole family in Heaven and Earth is named am we are of the family of Jesus Christ amen we are Brothers and Sisters in Christ we are the Bride of Jesus Christ and of course we take his name in baptism amen now what kind of family are we going to be what kind of family does the father want us to be that's a good question isn't it let's drop down to verse 16 that the father would Grant you according to the riches of his glory to be strong strengthened with might by his spirit in the inner man that Christ May dwell in your hearts by faith that ye being rooted and grounded in theology in church being rooted and grounded in church being rooted and grounded in love love may be able to comprehend with All Saints what is the breadth the length the depth the height and to know the love of Christ which passes all knowledge that you might be filled with all the fullness of God the family of God is a family of love amen a family of love all what manner of love the father have bestowed upon us that we should be called the sons of God by this shall all men know you're my disciples when you have love one for another the family of God is identified by a gape love not by being nice to one another amen by a agapy love that's love without respect to persons that you're not going to get anything out of it by loving when you're not being loved back by love that can sincerely turn the cheek that can can go seven times 70 that kind of love is how the family of God is identified with that Jesus said be perfect even as your father which is in heaven is perfect that ye may be the children of of your father the family we're talking about family now which is in heaven for he maketh the son to rise on the evil and on the good and send the reign of the justice so I God expects his children his family to do the same thing amen don't be looking for somebody that likes you don't be looking for somebody that can give you something back be looking for the person who don't like you who won't give you something back and be good to them because that's what God's family doesen don't be claiming I'm part of the family of God not do that you're just making yourself not look too good I'm so glad we got the word of God today amen it lets us know where we're standing children that can love your enemy they can bless them that curse you do good to them that hate you pray for them that despitefully use you and even persecute you this is the vision that God has for his family the vision that he wants us to walk in to comprehend with All Saints the love of Christ to be rooted and grounded in love to be filled with the fullness of God to love everyone just the way he loves God had this vision from the beginning it will be that way in the end and Satan's trying trying to trick us up with a a confused Vision that that's not necessary God understands we're humans nobody can be perfect why don't you just say I need more of the Holy Ghost I need more of my nature changed why don't we just get back to the gospel that's really what's important there was a little girl her name was murth and this is a true story and uh she had a 14 year old dog that had passed away and that dog's name was Abby and because of the dog being older and she was young they they really grew very attached and you could just imagine her heart was just completely broken when the dog had died and she really wanted to see that dog in heaven and wanted God to take care of the dog so she actually asked her mom if she could write a Letter to God and and and and and and sent a picture of Abby that so so that when the dog got there you know would would recogniz God Jesus would recognize the dog and take good care of her so this is what she said in the letter said dear God would you please take care of my dog she died yesterday and is with you in heaven I miss her very much I am happy that you let her ha uh that you let me have her as a dog even though she got sick I hope you will play with her she likes to play with balls and to swim I'm sending a picture of her so when you see her um uh I'm sorry I'm sorry I'm sending you a picture of her when you see her you'll know that she is my dog and I really miss her love murth it was penned by her mother Claire so we they put the the the letter uh in the in the in the mailbox and she put extra stamps on because it was going way to heaven right so they had put extra postage on it and it just said to God uh in heaven and had a return address and that was it so somewhere God blessed the the man at the postal service or whoever grabbed this thing grabbed it uh looked it and and read it and one day a few days later sitting at the door was this uh box wrapped in gold uh and um and and and so they they they they opened it up and they noticed there was a book there titled uh by Mr Rogers titled when a pet dies taped to the front of the cover was the letter that she had written and uh on one side uh was the letter uh with with the envelope and on the other side was the picture of the dog um and uh there was a note there and it said Dear murth Abby arrived safely in heaven having the picture was a big help I recognized Abby right away Abby isn't sick anymore her spirit is here with me just like it says stays like just like it stays in your heart Abby love being your dog and since we don't need our bodies in heaven I I I don't have any pocket to give you a p uh to keep your picture in so I'm sending it back to you in this little book for you to keep and and something to remember Abby by uh thank you for the beautiful letter and thank you and thank your mother for helping me uh helping you write it and sending it to me what a wonderful mother you have I picture especially for you I'm sending my blessings every day and remember that I love you very much and by the way I am with you everywhere there is love everywhere there is love that's where God is at amen that's the vision that God has for us to walk walk in his love Ephesians says for we are the workmanship we are his workmanship created in Christ Jesus unto good works which God had before ordained that we should walk in them this is the vision of God and he he's speaking to an Ephesian Church age an Ephesian Church which is a mature church but we know that not all people people want to walk in the truth he said Ephesians 5:14 wherefore the father saith awake thou that sleepest shall rise from the dead and Christ shall give thee light see then that you walk circumspectly not as fools but as wise Redeeming the time because the days are evil we don't want to waste the precious time that we have we even know how long we're going to live am wherefore be ye not unwise but understanding what the will of the Lord is the will of the Lord is for us to walk in the complete word of God Amen that's perfect love this is when you walk in this you're walking in love does no good to hear the word of God and not to follow it we got to manifest it the Bible says wherefore laying apart all filthiness and superfluity of naughtiness and receive with meekness the engrafted word which is able to save your souls but be ye doers of the word and not hearers only deceiving yourself so I say while you're sitting in the seats today while you're listening in the live stream today or while you're listening to the let me just say this be Desiring to live the word to manifest the word to walk in the word to do the word more than to hear it do not be satisfied with hearing it do not be satisfied till you awake in his likeness to you're living that word amen so as we hear the light of the word whatever God speaks however he speaks it to us when we obey it we become the word that's it it's so simple amen you don't need anybody else to tell you you're living the word you don't need anybody else to give you credentials you don't need to get anybody else's approval all you have to do is when you hear the gospel preached you say yes Lord I want to do that and you become the Living Word habach 2 ver uh chapter 2:2 says and the Lord answered me and said write the vision make it plain on the tables that he may run that readeth it write the vision make it plain on upon tables that ye may run that he may run that readeth it now this is we you know there's all sorts of things that we can write on but the the tables are really in our heart 2 Corinthians 3:2 says ye are our Epistles written in our hearts known and read of all men this Vision has to be wrote there right amen for as much as ye are manifestly declared to be the Epistles of Christ ministered by US Written not with ink but with the spirit of the Living God not in tables of stone but in fleshly tables of the heart so when you take this vision and you you this Vision of Love of a family that God is wanting to get his family together and the true family is a family of love and you write that in your your heart and your life is a life of love and and people who who read your life can say yes that's the way I'm catching it this is Christ by this shall all men know you're my disciples not when you can barely get along with one another not when you can turn your cheek because you don't want to look at the person Soul full of the love of God oh how many loves this word don't you get quiet you're not allowed to get quiet in here that's the rules it's my only rule 1 John chapter 1 verse5 1 John chapter 1 verse5 this then is the message which he heard of him and declare unto you that God is light and in him is no Darkness at all now now here's the thing this scripture is not for me to tell you what you're doing wrong this is not for me to tell you where you don't have the light or where you have Darkness this scripture is for me to know that God does not want me to walk in any Darkness that's what that scripture is for if we say that we have we have a relationship with Jesus Christ and we walk in Darkness we lie and do not the truth wow if you tell some people that they will get offended but you know what it's not my word I can't take credit I can't take credit nor should I be discouraged because they walk away but if we walk in the light as he is in the light we have fellowship with one another and the blood of Jesus Christ his son cleanses us from all sin we need to walk in the light of the word in order to stay under the blood we can't just do what we want and say cover me with your blood we literally have to walk in the light in order for the blood to keep us where it needs to be didn't the prophet say if you do not follow what God asked you to do he is not obligated to show you anything more when he the spirit of truth will come he will lead and guide you into some of the truth all the truth so when we come to church we should be able to expect to hear more truth amen and it may not be you know more Mysteries more knowledge more I never heard this before but God is speaking something to our heart that he wants us to do that's God speaking to us directly Ephesians chapter 4 Ephesians chap 4:1 17 this I say therefore in testifying the Lord that you henceforth walk not as other believers walk in the vanity of their mind you know I am not scared of the h juls I am not scared of these people who are so far out there that they're going to trick me is those ones who are willing to walk in 95% of the truth but the other 5% they say yeah you don't have to worry about that this is the main thing that's the spirit that'll get you off in the vanity of their own mind having the understand their understanding dark and being alienated from the life of God which we know is pure love God is love through the ignorance that is in them because of the blindness of their heart who being past feeling have given themselves over to lascivious to walk to work all uncleanness with greediness see it's so it's all about them it's a selfish person he says but you have not so learned Christ we don't teach Christ that way it's not about entertainment it's not about feeling good it's about a relationship that'll get you to heaven it's about making it in a Rapture that's what it's about Paul said in Galatians chapter 1 verse 8 this is I I think was worth repeating here well Paul said follow me as I follow Christ but he also said But though we are an angel from heaven preach any other gospel unto you than what we have preached unto you let him be a cursed wow so having the supernatural experience felt your body leave go over here had this experience amen if it's anything other than the word of God let it be accursed and we said before so I now again I say say I say sorry so say I now again if any man preach any other gospel unto you than that ye have received let him be a cursed so we got to stay with the word we got to stay with the father's Vision we need to stay where Christ wants us to stay a Ephesians 4 just remember Ephesians 4 helps us to see the vision that God wants us to walk in I therefore the prisoner of the Lord beseech you that you walk worthy of the calling where ye are called with all loneliness with all meekness with all longsuffering with all forbearing one another in love amen endeavoring to keep the unity of the spirit in the bond of Peace God wants wants his family to love one another now whether you had one child or you had seven or however many children you had you never wanted to see your child uh fighting with anybody because they're representing you right they're representing you look we don't do that in the home what are you doing that for God does not want his children fussing and fighting and giving a cold shoulder and negative in fact God said I I'm I I'm not even going to have fellowship with you I don't care what offering you bring me I don't care how perfect it is I'm not gonna accept I'm not gonna have fellowship with you until you make that thing right with your your brother and sister amen God is putting a priority that he's not going to lower himself to have a subpar relationship if you don't want to put the word first are you with me look I think what we should do is just fall in love with the word forget about our theology forget about what we think we don't got much time to get ready some of us have really been dragging come on brother that's what we need we need some amens we we we need to get serious about falling in love with God so we can express love one to another amen so we can keep the father's Vision going so we can we didn't even get into reaching out to others because it's it's really part of the vision H Ephesians 1 verse I mean Ephesians 5 verse 1 be ye therefore followers of God as dear children and walk in love Ephesians just just filled with how we need to walk in God's love as Christ also loved us and gave himself for us as an offering and a sacrifice to God for a sweet smelling uh smelling Savor amen so if we see the father's Eternal purpose that we're a family of love we need to walk in it we need to walk in love we need to walk in in truth amen amen our Heavenly father's Vision hasn't changed it it didn't change when he first called Peter Peter come follow me and I'll make you Fishers of Men what was the last thing that he said to Peter or that Great Commission go ye therefore and teach All Nations back baptizing them in the name of the Father the Son and the Holy Ghost teaching them to observe all things whatsoever commanded you and lo I Am With You Always even to the end of the world now do you think he wants you to leave out some things there the Bible says teaching them to observe all things whatsoever I've commanded you amen now the first thing that he told Peter is is basically the last thing that he tells his disciples his vision hasn't changed he wants his whole family there he knows that we weren't even going to be born till this age right amen and you know there's people out there that need to hear but God's Vision hasn't changed and the Satan throws out a lot of lures get us distracted take our mind mind off of what's really important and I'll tell you I'm going to just say this the love of God is not a gift character is not a gift it's not it's a victory what do you have to do to get the character of God you have to deny yourself you have to pick up your cross and you have to follow him when your flesh says no I don't want to do it I don't feel like going to church I don't I don't feel like reading the word I don't feel like praying I don't feel like listening to the tapes that you got a job to do there you got to put that that old man where he belongs all right we need to follow just please bear with me brother Brandon went beyond the curtain of time he said he seen millions of people and there was a voice that spoke to him he says you've been gathered to your people like Jacob gathered to his people and brother bandam said all these my people are all these Broms are these my family and the voice said no they're your converts to Christ in other words they're part of the family of God Amen the ones that you led to the Lord some of these women you think are so young and beautiful were more than 90 years old when you led them to the Lord no wonder they're crying out my precious brother can you imagine 90 years old you you just you you hardly living any more of your life over for some I'll just say it like that you lived your life kind of in the vanity of your own mind and this man comes by and tells you the truth and you accept it because something inside of you said it is the truth I can imagine they were so happy to be on the other side so happy part of the F he's gathering together now this is the the the vision that he stepped into right let's take a look what type of family this is he said from that time from that time in that message from that time he says I've been more determined to do everything that I can to persuade men and women to please be sure of this if God's love doesn't anchor in your heart supremely don't you take any sensation or motion you be sure that you can turn the other cheek that Christ is all in all to you don't you miss it my brother now just remember I'll say this with Faith that I have in that Vision whatever it was I speak it in the name of the Lord except you have that perfect love you'll never be there God's family is a family of love amen you know and it I I know I know look I know we all try to be nice to one another you know we really put our best our best but you understand we've got to come to this perfect love so what we got to focus on is where it seems to be slipping in our lives in our in our minds thoughts that we have things that we let get in there because we need to get to that place where the family needs to be now remember if we were just in Luther's age hey Justified I believe that' be it don't need to be Sanctified don't don't need the the the manifestation of many things but in this age we do except you have perfect love you'll never be there because nothing could ever be there without it amen he said your spirit will be out of place there it couldn't come there be no way for it to come beyond the curtain of time we're closing I am more convinced than ever in my life that don't take perfect love to enter in that place there was no jealousy there was no tiredness praise God for that right no sickness praise God for that no old age praise God for that no death only Supreme Beauty and joy whatever you do lay aside everything else until you get perfect love amen get to where you can love everybody even every enemy no matter if the plane is rocking the lights are flashing The Guns of the enemy are upon you these things do not matter forget the news forget what's happening I am telling you when the Rapture comes they will still be killing one another he said get perfect love if you're not saved accept Jesus Christ as your savior now if you have not been baptized in water be baptized now if you have not received the baptism in uh in the in the Holy Spirit receive it now press on to that perfect love which will take you to the beautiful and joyful place beyond the curtain of time now remember this is his Eternal Vision that he's had from the beginning amen amen and we're coming we're at the climax of it we're coming to where there's no more chance for anybody to be saved and he we get this one last commission after he goes and he he he he he he gets a the the the first fruits of what's on the other side he comes back just like Joshua and Caleb did when they they brought back the fruit and said we're it is the land that floweth with milk and honey and and it's ours and God gave it to the prophet came back and he said it is real that it is a place of perfect love and whatever you do make sure you get perfect love because you won't get it when you get there you got to get it first God's family is a family of love this is the Father's Vision let's stand together not many people have the vision but our heavenly father wants us to catch the vision walk in it walk in love redeem the time help others to get converted to Christ let people read the gospel in your life forget your words amen let them see how you handle things when you're in hot water when you're being yelled at let them see how you react be faithful in everything you do be full of grace be full of love be full of Mercy speak the truth in love live for others share the gospel this is what God is looking at you know Saints we come here to hear not just hear from God but we come to receive from God and you've got to be the one that that straight way drops everything that you're doing everything that all the ideas that you had and your plans at what you're going to do you just got to drop it and follow the word follow it because this is what will take you to where you want to go and I know nothing else that will take you there nothing else it's just the word and I'm so glad that God sent a prophet to make clear to us what the word really is what it really means amen let's sing that that song Love Love Lifted Me it brought us into the family amen I was Sinking Deep in sin far from the peaceful Shore I was Sinking Deep in sin far from the peace for sure very deeply stained within thinking to rise no more but the master of the sea heard my despairing cry from the waterers Lifted Me Now save him I Love Lifted Me Love Lifted Me when nothing else could help Love

they have enough holy ghost or they have enough love or but I'll just say it like this we can't be we can't any time that we spend seeking more of the Holy Spirit which is the love of God the more will be pleasing in his sight and I just I want to pray but instead of just praying for a few I just thought we could come together and we could pray as a family you know when our kids were at the at
