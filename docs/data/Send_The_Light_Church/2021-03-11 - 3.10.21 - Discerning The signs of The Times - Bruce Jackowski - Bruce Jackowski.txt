lord to be more like you [Music] share all my rights away in this world of sin i am so needy lord make me pure within amen pray that your heart just hurts desire amen amen well if you turn with me tonight to first thessalonians chapter 5 praise the lord first thessalonians chapter 5 verse 1 he says but of the times and of the seasons brethren ye have no need that i write unto you for you yourselves know perfectly that the day of the lord so cometh as a thief in the night for when they say peace and safety then sudden destruction cometh upon them as travail upon a woman with child and they shall not escape but ye brethren are not in darkness that that day should overtake you as a thief you are all of the children of light and the children of the day and we are not of the night nor of darkness therefore let us not sleep as other as do others but let us watch and be sober for they that sleep sleep in the night and they that be drunken are drunken in the night but let us who are of the day be sober putting on the breastplate of faith and love and for a helmet the hope of salvation for god hath not appointed us to wrath but to obtain salvation by our lord jesus christ who died for us that whether we wake or sleep we should live together with him wherefore comfort yourselves together and edify one another even as also ye do amen it's bar hits for word of prayer dear lord jesus we're needy father tonight lord but we come to him that is the most sufficient god and lord jesus you've been tried on every point you've been tested every place where we would be tested and you have overcome and we pray lord tonight that you'll come and cleanse our hearts our hands lord jesus may you come and break the bread of life to us lord may you just come and be our guest lord we love you we invite your presence in jesus christ's name we ask it amen amen you may be seated amen praise the lord amen so sometimes well it's good for us to read scriptures that are should be familiar they should be familiar sometimes it's been years since we've read things but i'd like to speak tonight on discerning the signs of the times so paul when he wrote to the thessalonian church he says but of the times and of the seasons brethren you have no need that i write unto you for you yourselves know perfectly that the day of the lord so cometh as a thief in the night so we know that over the ages you know people have predicted when jesus is coming and when he's not coming and and and then they make all kinds of predictions and then they don't come to pass and but they they just keep going on and on and on but paul writing to the church he said i shouldn't have to write this to you because you know perfectly that the day of the lord so cometh as a thief in the night for when they shall say peace and safety then sudden destruction cometh upon them as travail upon a woman with child and they shall not escape amen he says but ye brethren are not in darkness now if you look at the way he wrote this he says he's coming as a thief in the night so he's he's telling them it's going to be a dark time when he comes but he said you're not in darkness you're not there amen you are the children of the light he says you are not in darkness that that day should overtake you as a thief you are all the children of light and the children of the day and we are none of the night nor of darkness so no matter how uncertain it is no matter how crazy things are we're not moved by these things paul said he said i i shouldn't even have to write this to you he says because you should know these things amen you are the children of the day praise the lord amen he says therefore let us not sleep amen let us not sleep metaphorically that means to yield to become slothful and to be comfortable with sin to being different about your salvation becomes no longer valuable to you well i'm saved i guess i'm all right i'm gonna make it anyways that's what happens when you fall asleep you fall asleep at the wheel or you fall asleep on the couch you are oblivious to everything that's going on so if your wife is making dinner you don't even smell dinner anymore because you become oblivious to it if you're driving that's a bad place to become oblivious and in this day in this hour we're the children of the light it's not a time for us to fall asleep at the wheel it's not a time for us to be comfortable with sin he says but let us watch and be sober amen and that means to be vigilant amen a vigilant man is somebody who's who's detail-oriented he's careful like when you're going on a trip it's a good thing not to forget certain things like your toothbrush or your shaver or half your clothes and you have to be vigilant to make sure that everything is ready do i have my passport do i have all everything that i need in this day and age do i have my mask how many times you get out of your car and you're halfway to the store and you're going oh gotta get the mask go get the mask be vigilant brethren for they that sleep sleep in the night those that have they that have become partakers of sin and that they're not doing it in the daytime they're doing it in the night and that's when the lord is coming the lord isn't coming in a bright day he's coming in the night amen and they that are drunken are drunken in the night i mean you you're pretty bound up with alcohol if you're drunk during the day but at night people don't mind letting their hair down at night just a couple glasses of wine i think i'll just have a little more you know and it because it's their labors are over with they think everything's done it's finished it's time for me to relax this is not a time for us to relax amen but let us who are of the day be sober putting on the breastplate of faith and love and for a helmet the hope of salvation amen and i like that the hope of salvation it means to have a joyful and confident expectation of eternal salvation amen yeah in the darkness i have an expectation for salvation i'm not going to fail amen and why do i know that i'm not going to fail he says for god hath not appointed us to wrath the world is appointed to wrath but he has not appointed you to wrath when you got baptized it you you felt that you needed to repent and you got repented and you got baptized and the expectation is that god is going to keep his word and he's going to fill you with the holy ghost because that's what the scripture says the scriptures here says he has not appointed us to wrath so get that out of your mind it's a scareful time yes because some of us have been around for a long time for me coming up on 45 years i've been serving the lord i mean it's a long time but i've gotten slothful and i've gotten comfortable and and i've forgotten that this is an hour when jesus is coming amen amen i want you to take a look at zechariah 14 because this is a scripture that that we should all be familiar with he says in verse 6 he says but it shall come to pass in that day that the light shall not be clear nor dark well paul said the lord is coming as a thief in the night now here's a day that zechariah said there's coming a day that the light will be not clear nor dark it'll be just kind of gloomy you know you get up in the morning and it's just kind of misty and there's fog and you can't you know you're not really excited about getting out of bed you know when you get up and you go out and and then if it's right around the freezing time where all that fog instantly turns to ice when you start to drive down the road then that kind of really aggravates you right that's not a day that you're very excited about but if you get up in the morning and the sun is shining and the birds are singing and else you get up there's just something about that but the hour that we live in right now is not that day it shall not be clear nor dark but it should be one day which will be known to the lord because he's coming as a thief the lord only knows what day that will be and it would not day nor night but it shall come to pass that at the evening time when it's all gloomy and it's all confusion and everything's going on there will be light because you are the children of the day you are the children of the light and you are not dark you're not in darkness so you're not dead you're not drunken you're not falling asleep amen amen this is an hour when when you can feel it there's so much animosity against people you can't even oh don't have an opinion no more no opinions opinions are gone everything is such there's such a tension that people are so they're so nervous about everything but you know what the lord has thoughts of peace towards me we just read that you are not appointed to wrath amen so you have to believe what the word of god has said in the uniting time in sign brother branham said so we're talking of this uniting time the sign of the uniting time see jesus was here in this last scripture reading he was rebuking the clergy for not being able to discern the time or the sign of the time and that's always been a great thing to the people see to be able to discern the sign of the time that we are living in because god writes it plainly so nobody could escape it there's so much uncertainty everybody i mean sister patricia your whole world is uncertain who's next be not afraid it is high all the all the blood it was it was the foundation of the new jerusalem the 12 apostles is the foundation of the city in the book of revelation and they were all upset because of the waves and jesus was asleep and they were all upset and they went to him and said don't you care that we're gonna die he says i have not appointed you to wrath amen so that's the scripture for today i have not appointed you to wrath praise the lord amen amen in the flashing red light of his coming brother branham said so we think of my text as a flashing red light of his coming it reminds me of waiting at a railroad station that when a man or people stand around as many of us has when we was waiting to catch the train and we can't hear the train and you don't even see it but you know it's time maybe the dispatcher says it's a little late he's not exactly on time but we don't know just when but he will arrive soon and we'll walk around the station with our hands in our pockets sitting on our suitcases go out and buy a bag of peanuts talk to somebody across the street right i'm going to build my house going to work on my retirement program i'm getting married i'm gonna have kids we're gonna go off to college we're gonna make our vacation everything else he says then all of a sudden something happens there's a noise that takes place out on the track and when we did the arm goes down and the red lights begin to flash and what is that the train is in the blocks and though you can't hear him and though you can't see him but yet the flashing red light and that arm down shows that he's coming in and then if you're expecting to leave on that train you better throw the bag of peanuts down you better stop your talking get up in your suitcase and get ready or you'll be left behind because he's just stopping locally just for a few moments and then he'll be gone and if you stand to chat the neighbor across the street you'll be left behind i have not ordained you or appointed you to wrath but brother bruce do you see what everything that's going on i'm not looking at that amen let's look at second peter 3. so first thessalonians paul wrote that now peter now peter wrote about the day of the lord also yes and peter and and paul they were kind on opposite ends of the spectrum you know peter it was all faith and big and i can do it and paul after god knocked him down he said i said i can't do anything but his strength is sufficient for me amen so at second peter three starting with verse one because i i was gonna i had cut it down but i i like how this is written he says this second epistle beloved i now write unto you it's written to you in both which i stir up your pure minds by way of rememberings see he's taken the same avenue that paul said i shouldn't have to write to you about the seasons and the times because you should be aware of these things but then again you need to be remembered or reminded that you may be mindful of the words which were spoken before by the holy prophets and of the commandment of us the apostles of the lord and savior so he tells the believer what you should be focused on the wall street journal is not the word of god i don't care what's on youtube i don't care i don't care fox business don't care don't care because i'm looking at the word of god look at what he says so he's talking about the day of the lord knowing this first that there will come in the last days scoffers walking after their own lusts and saying where is the promise of his coming for since the fathers fell asleep all things continue as they were from the beginning of the creation everything is still the same you're still telling me that i need to get saved you're still telling me i need to do this i need to do that he says but where's the promise and yet all around us is signs all around us the red lights are flashing and we're still eating peanuts sitting on our suitcases wondering what is going on who's i got some quotes amen amen he says where is the promise of his coming for since the fathers fell asleep all things continue as they were from the beginning of the creation for this they willingly are ignorant of that by the word of god the heavens were of old and the earth standing out of the water and in the water whereby the world that then was was overflowed with water perished i want you to notice that peter as he's talking starts to tell the believer as it was in the days of noah he says there they were and he says and they they were they were infidels because they were willingly ignorant yes sir that's it they willingly did not hold god in high esteem they did not believe that god created the earth they did not believe he created the heavens and even though the water was in you know because the dry land appeared that's what book of genesis says but it never rained so they were in the water out of the water but they didn't believe that there was a god they didn't believe there was a purpose of god they didn't they they refused to acknowledge him in their in their mind and he says whereby the world that then was was overflowed with water perished that's the flood amen but the heavens and the earth which are now by the same word are kept in store so he warns the believers he said all right now pay attention don't just fall asleep that the same word arc the same word are kept in store reserved unto fire against the day of judgment and their perdition of ungodly men peter telling the church god is going to keep his word if he destroyed the world by a flood he's going to dis he's already reserved it for fire but he can't send the fire if there's everybody is godly another red flashing light but beloved be not ignorant of this one thing that one day as with the lord is a thousand years and a thousand years is one day and the lord is not slack concerning his promise as some men count slackness but is long long-suffering to us word not willing that any should perish but that all should come to repentance because i have already said i have appointed you not to wrath whether you're a young believer whether you only been a christian for a couple of days maybe you haven't even gotten the holy ghost yet don't be afraid of everything that's going on but know that god is suffering and he'll hold everything back until you get to the place where he wants you to be at the wrath is not going to fall until everybody is in their right place believe me he will not let his word fall to the ground but the day of the lord will come as a thief in the night in which the heavens shall pass away with a great noise and the elements shall melt with fervent heat and the earth also and the works that are therein shall be burned up and seeing that all these things shall be dissolved what manner of persons ought we to be in all holy conversation and godliness and conversation means the manner of life that you live not what you talk but what is your conduct knowing that we are in a dark world we are in a time when god is getting ready to come back what manner of people ought we to be amen amen amen looking for and hastening unto the coming of the day of god wherein the heavens being on fire shall be dissolved and the elements shall melt with fervent heat nevertheless we according to his promise we look for a new heaven and a new earth wherein dwelleth righteousness wherefore beloved seeing that you look for such things be diligent that you may be found of him in peace without spot and blameless and diligent means labor to study to hasten to exert oneself to endeavor amen that's what we oh it's a scary time it's okay it's all right it's all right it's i know it's scary i know it was scary when brother john came sister cheryl came it was scary it was scary for me and donna it was scary when we came in do i have enough time to have children you know how many people in this message young men growed up graduated out of high school no thought of going to college because the day of the lord is coming as a thief in the night i got to get married some young girl she's forgotten about everything she's got to get married and they get married and then a year later they're shipwrecked yes keep your eye on the goal friends let's look at luke 11. now i found a couple of different scriptures where where jesus spoke about discerning the signs of the time but luke 11 verse 29 it says so when the people were gathered thick together he began to say this is an evil generation they seek a sign and there should be no sign given to it but the sign of jonas the prophet now he's not exactly addressing the pharisees and the sadducees where he does in other places but he tells them there are an evil generation and they seek a sign and he says for as jonas was a sign unto the ninevites so shall also the son of man be to this generation and the sign in this generation is you because you are the children of the light and jesus has already come in the flesh first john says if they deny that he's come in the flesh then they are not of him the only way jesus is coming right now is you jonas was a sign unto the ninevites and so shall also the son of man be to this generation the queen of the south shall rise up in the judgment with the men of this generation and condemn them for she came from the utmost parts of the earth to hear the wisdom of solomon and behold a greater than solomon is here and the men of nineveh shall rise up in the judgment with this generation and shall condemn it for they repented at the preaching for they repented at the preaching of jonas and behold a greater than jonas is here amen brother branham and queen of sheba says so now this little queen had some smart ideas and i'd like you to notice she said now i have never seen this i don't know anything about it we're living in that hour i have no idea what they're going to do tomorrow some of the things they've done today i went what are you kidding me so this is what brother branham said the queen of sheba did and if brother branham said it was good enough for the queen of sheba it's good enough for me then you have to make up your own mind the little queen had some smart ideas and i'd like you to notice she said no i never seen this i don't know nothing about it so i imagine the first thing the little queen did was purchase her a bible so she could read and find out she said now if it's some kind of a put up it won't be according to the bible their bible but if their bible has predicted such a thing then it will be right now that's what christians ought to do when you come to a meeting don't condemn just search out the scriptures what if they'd have been what if they'd have been that sincere with jesus he said searching out the scriptures for they are they that testify in me and in them you think you have eternal life and you think you have eternal life and that's what testifies of me amen so that's the first thing i don't understand where people have gone wrong really when i got saved and i started serving the lord that was the first thing where do i live i better go look we see what the bible says where i should live maybe i'll ask god what kind of car should i buy maybe i'll ask god and see what's in the bible about it maybe when i go over here i'll see what kind of a wi-fi well god already picked out my wife so he did he picked out my wife so i'm okay with that i i like what he picked out but see that's what we should do but we don't we don't what church to go to where place who to support who not to support who to hear on the tv who not to hear on the tv who to listen to on youtube who not to listen to on youtube who to do all these things what does the bible say are those people telling the word of god or are they taking something and only telling you part of the word of the god when's the last time you heard about the day of the lord shall come as a thief in the night [Applause] right it's in the book in the identified christ of ages brother branham said so now we know when you see a sign a true bible sign and there is a true bible voice behind it if there's no voice that follows the sign if there's no voice that follows the biblical sign just some old theological voice forget it it never came from god oh it sounds like a good idea let's do this well what did god say about it well you know we are the bride we are the elect what did the bible say about it you know what we're doing no i don't know what you're doing i don't know what you're doing well i'm following so-and-so i'm following this guy i mean you know i had brother mark he come out to my house and we sit we were standing in the kitchen we were talking and he said do you know brother so-and-so and i said oh yeah i know him i said i actually met him and he was telling me he said oh yeah they got a a letter that brother brandon wrote and this guy's supposed to be a big guy and everything else he said what do you think about that i said well i can tell you what the bible says i can tell you what the prophet said say what's on the tapes so if whatever you found don't line up with the tapes praise the lord god bless you but i'm sticking with the tapes i'm sticking with the bible amen he says if it's the same old theological voice forget it it never came from god there is always god told moses if they won't believe the first sign they'll believe the voice of the second sign now let's go here in case you're new and you don't know about this exodus 4 amen moses is at the burning bush he's telling god all the reasons why he can't be the messenger of the hour i can't be the guy i can't talk i can do all this other stuff and god does just see moses is a great example because that's what you always are telling god you get up in the morning say lord i can't take this test i can't take this test i can't do this anymore i can't i can't god's not even listening to you he's going i've already appointed you not to wrath so i'm not going to destroy you i pro appointed you to do this and this and this and [Music] because of foreign knowledge and a bunch of other things i can make everything work out for my glory amen so exodus four we'll just skip um verse one we're gonna let's go and start with verse six and the lord said furthermore unto him put now thy hand under thy bosom and he put his hand in his bosom and when he took it out behold his hand was leprous of snow and he said put thy hand now in thy bosom again and he put his hand in his bosom again plucked it out of his bosom and behold it was turned again as other flesh and this is god speaking he says and it shall come to pass if they will not believe believe thee nor hearken to the voice of the first sign that they will believe the voice of the latter sign and if it and if and it shall come to pass if they will not believe also these two signs neither hearken unto the voice then thou shalt take of the water of the river and pour it upon the dry land and the water shall be taken out of the river shall become blood upon the dry land that's it it's dawn if you can't figure out to stay with the scriptures in a scriptural voice god will give you so many opportunities but then one day he that is righteous remain righteous he that's ungodly will remain ungodly god is going to shut the door he is going to shut the door there has to be a voice with the sign absolutely and if it's the same old theological voice forget it you already had that it's something god is trying to attract the attention of the people by a sign and then give them the voice that's behind the sign and it must be a scriptural voice moses wouldn't have believed it and neither would paul but it has to be a scriptural voice so let's go to matthew 16 amen praise god praise the lord brother sister i know i know people are unsettled i know they got questions but the god we have the answer to the question we have it matthew 16 verse 1 so the pharisees also with the sadducees came and tempting desired him that he would show them a sign from heaven and he answered and said when it is evening you say it will be fair weather for the sky is red and in the morning it will be foul whether today for the sky is red and lol ring oh you hypocrites you can discern the face of the sky but can you not discern the signs of the times a wicked and adulterous generation seeketh after a sign and there shall no sign be given unto it but the sign of the prophet jonas and he left them and departed we need to be able to discern the signs of the times of the hour that we're living in brother branham said it like this he said you know he says here was here was the children of israel and he says they were down in egypt and they'd been down in egypt for 400 years and god sent them moses and moses came and said i have come from god and i'm here to deliver you and the first thing they said was and what sign do you bring to us and what god is it and what is his name and he showed them the sign and they got all excited right and they said oh this is good we're getting out of here i may not even have to show up for work tomorrow but if we had time which we don't we'll find out that the very next day when moses went before pharaoh and said let my people go pharaoh said if you've got time to have six churches nights there's seven days in the week and i got you for five well in fact i got you for all seven but i got you for five and you want two days off to worship the lord you got time to worship the lord you do you got time to pray you do we go get your own stubble and when moses went back and told him he said let my people go he said you again well obviously i didn't make it hard enough because you're still hanging around right but the children of israel they started to murmur and complain because they could not discern the sign of the time it didn't make sense to them if god's going to take us out of here why would he make it harder well if you read your bible you'll never find a place where it doesn't work like that when they came up out of egypt and egypt was driving them out like brother john said on sunday and he said and here they come up they got right to the red sea and the bible says always like this when the lord first showed me this he knew exactly where to put them there was a city to the north there was a city to the south there was no place to go and they could see the dust of the egyptians coming put them in a really hard place now because they didn't understand the sign they said you know what i read my bible i'm looking in here god delivered noah with an ark let's build an ark have you ever read that have you ever heard brother branham say it on a tape this oh let's build an ark and god will float us no because you don't understand you can't discern the hour that you're living in you're misapplying the word of god to a different place he already built the ark he's not building it again and if i could be so bold that's thus saith the lord my in the queen of sheba brother branham said so he told the pharisees those great clergymen of that day he says now you can look at the sun and it's lowering and you say tomorrow it's going to be foul weather and if it's clear whether it will be fair weather you hypocrites you're supposed to be clergymen and you can discern the things of the world better than you can discern the signs of the times he said you know he said that andaluvian world was so far advanced from us amen and when they were so far advanced he says when noah noah heard god's voice and when it was when it became part of his life he was not slothful remember what we read in the opening scriptures when it became part of his life he was driven to fulfill the word of god and he became christ in that dark hour he built an ark the ark just started to appear and god was long suffering for 120 years waiting for somebody to say yes lord amen it's not russell crowe give me a break you know they made a russell crowman made a noah movie and a assembly of god brother come to me at work he said hey bruce he says have you seen this russell i said you know i'm not really big on hollywood trying to interpret the bible because they don't know how to interpret the bible why would why if that isn't the truth today everybody be interested all right listen everybody's interested who be the president well i am too but what difference does it make i want to know who will be the king of eternity christ that's the main thing yes i want to know about my nation i'm interested in it i'm an american i'm interested in my nation but brother let that be second my god is first yes sir we've lost our way is god first or whatever you can find some tweet or whatever is on your twitter feed or whatsoever on youtube or whatsoever on the facebook or whatever why is that the first thing you look at and you don't open up your bible and say oh let's see what's going on here everything that you do should be measured by the word of god everything amen but the thing it is they take the nation they take the things of the world who will be who will play who's going to be this certain person who's going to be the next movie star a lot of people many people today church members pentecostal people baptist presbyterians they can tell you about a more about movie life than they can tell you about bible life more children can tell you about davey crockett or gunsmoke or some of them they can tell then they can tell you about jesus christ because that's what they're taught in their homes this generation is the fulfillment of scriptures it's so amazing to me i rejoice my praise the lord amen let's go to matthew 24. so we looked at our first we need to know how to discern the sign of the times like i say [Applause] people don't want to hear that scares them i scared something i don't want to know this is the end of the world how will i ever get married well if god wants you to get married he'll hold off the wrath until the wife comes well i mean i i can tell you donna and i we were young jesus won't we ever have any children i said i don't know but let's get ready for him he's coming now the children are 40 and 41. brother johnny i know you had those conversations we all thought we all thought long before patricia came along i remember when patricia got dedicated brother and sister what are you doing what are you doing matthew 24 so what a what is our main number one concern what should be our focus in this hour the day of the lord and it's coming as a thief in the night amen and how can we get ready okay so that's a bible question there's a bible question then there's a bible answer it's not an unsaid evening post the national enquirer don't have it brother so-and-so don't have it your girlfriend don't have it your knitting circle don't have it they don't have it i'm gonna get yelled at for that comment matthew 24 verse one and jesus went out and departed from the temples and his disciples came to him for to show him the buildings of the temple and jesus said unto them see you not all these things verily i say unto you there shall not be left here one stone upon another that shall not be thrown down and as he sat down upon the mount of olives so brother adam said he says the mount of olives is right across from temple mount and they they cross over across the valley maybe they had some you know they got some water and some bread and they sat down and they all sat down and they were sitting there and as he said on the mount of olives the disciples came unto him privately saying tell us when shall these things be and what shall be the sign of thy coming and of the end of the world very plain very direct to the point why is it written in the scriptures because he knows it's a question you have he knows it's a question you have so he's going to put the answer in the book so that you don't have to be nervous and you don't have to be worried and you can trust in the god of heaven now in his unfailing words of promise that's what brother adam called us they ask him three questions and he answers them as they ask him three questions see first when will there be one not one stone left upon another that's question number one what will be the sign of your coming and that's the one we're worried about and what is the end of the world because we know that'll be fire right three questions any answers three questions and great bible students today they placed the first question when he said pray that your flight be not in the winter time nor on the sabbath day they placed that in a future date of the coming of the lord at the end of the world so they took the scriptures and put them in the wrong place just like the children of israel saying let's build an ark that took place in a.d 70 when the great roman soldier a great army titus and his group come up there the great journal of rome beseeched the walls as jesus had foretold them he says and when you see jerusalem compassed about with armies then let him which is in the field don't come back into the city again now what good will it do some people try to support their doctrine that well people will still be living in the sabbath hours keeping the sabbath day when he comes well if his coming is universal you can't be keeping the sabbath for one side it's the sabbath day and on the other side of the world it's a day past the sabbath day see so that isn't it the sabbath keeping was for a people in the wilderness not for the universal church see and all these different things and they take the scriptures without having the holy spirit to divide them rightly and show what they are so if your first question is i'm not sure i'm born again you need to answer that question because without the holy ghost you cannot rightly divide the word of truth but here is what jesus was speaking to my most humble opinion was that he said that this generation in other words the generation that saw the fig tree putting forth his buds now i want you to notice as brother branham's talking about these he goes just look at your bible verse 4 he skips all of from 4 all the way down to verse 32. he skips it all and i know all the messages that came out of those first 31 verses is just great stuff in there he said the generation that saw the fig tree putting forth his bud see he said here and when the fig tree is beginning is tender and putteth forth its buds its branches you say summer is nigh likewise see when you see all of these things know the time and when you see all these three questions fulfilled amen the time is at the door and that generation that sees the fig tree and the fig tree is always israel and when israel goes back to her homeland and becomes a nation that generation will not pass away until these things are all fulfilled that's what he said and he will keep his word that's what he said so we'll start at verse 32 because i thought it was he says so now learn a parable of the fig tree when his branch is yet tender and putteth forth leaves you know that summer is nigh right nigh but there's no fruit on it the one time i preached about the fig tree jesus was just going up to jerusalem to to present himself as the king of kings before palm sunday he was on his way up there and he passed a fig tree and when he looked up in it there was no fruit he said they're cursed you're cursed and then he went in and they rejected him and when he came back out the disciples said hey that tree that you cursed withered up and died and it had when you see the fig tree coming back when you see israel in the homeland it's that's just the summer but where's the fruit heaven and earth look at what he says in verse 35 see he says when you see that fig tree that generation will not pass away till all these things be fulfilled heaven and earth shall pass away but my word shall not pass away so everything that i do make the pledge make the consecration from here forward every decision everything that i do will be based on the word of god and god will bless it and it won't fail it won't dry up and wither away you won't be unsuccessful you put god first god will take care of his own amen and look look at how it this follows just exactly what peter and paul wrote to the church but of that day and that hour knoweth no man no not the angels of heaven but my father only why because he's coming as a thief in the night we read that so right away he goes but as the days of noah were so shall also the coming of the son of man be for in the days that were before the flood they were eating and drinking marrying and giving in marriage until the day that noah entered into the ark and they knew not until the flood came and took them all away so shall also the coming of the son of man be so let's go to genesis 6 amen genesis 6 verse 1 so jesus telling his disciples he says you want to know when the end of the world is going to be you want to know when i'm coming back so the first thing to look for is the fig tree when you see the fig tree you will know summer is nigh make sure that you are connected with me make sure that you're sober make sure you're not asleep at the wheel make sure that you're diligent make sure make very sure because here's another sign as it was in the days of noah and it came to pass when men began to multiply in the face of the earth and daughters were born unto them that the sons of god saw the daughters of men that they were fair and they took them wives of all that they chose a time of beauty and when when the world was multiplying now what happened to my note where is it oh okay gotta stay in the right place [Music] so how long ago was the days of noah right we know it's almost four thousand years because two thousand years from the flood to jesus christ now it's two thousand years after right so we know it was about four thousand years ago well we're not going to go back that long ago because the pew charitable trust and and a whole bunch of other these statisticians didn't exist but we can go back to the eighteen hundreds after eighteen hundred this changed fundamentally the world population was around a billion people in the year eighteen hundred and increased seven fold since then since the 1800s and when it came to pass when men began to multiply in the face of the earth well it's multiplying there is around 108 billion people have ever lived on our planet this means that today's population the rise makes it about six and a half percent of the total number of people ever alive are on the earth now so they're multiplying it's a sign it's a sign amen and in verse 3 it says and the lord said we're still in genesis 6 he says and the lord said my spirit shall not always strive with man for that he is also his flesh yet his day shall be a hundred and twenty years and there were giants in the earth in those days and also after that when the sons of god came in unto the daughters of men and they bear children to them the same became mighty men which were of old men of renown and god saw that the wickedness of man was great on the earth when when man began to multiply like the grasshoppers when he started to multiply everywhere brother branham said it like this he says you can go out in the country and it's really beautiful and it's peaceful and you can live out there like a brother john's you can i don't know how many acres you got but i know it's a lot but brother john can walk out in the back field and it's quiet but if brother john walks too far out in his back field he runs right into an expressway isn't there an expressway behind you and there's noise and there's houses and whenever there's a lot of houses and a lot of noise there's a lot of stress and there's a lot of things that shouldn't be happening are happening when man begins to multiply on the face of the earth sin multiplies on the face of the earth it's a sign and that every imagination of the thoughts of his heart was only evil continually we know that it is illegal to commit murder but i can spend a little bit of money and get a playstation 5 and then i can get the set of goggles and i can go in 3d mode and then i can get me a glove in every imagination that i got if i want to rip the guy's heart out that's so cool i can shoot them i can get on i can get i can get people from all over the world that i don't even know who they are we can all go in and take a city they weren't doing that when i was in school in the 60s they weren't doing that in the 70s it's a sign of noah's day the scriptures are being fulfilled right before your eyes i don't see him yet i know but there's a flashing red light you when you see the light don't go i'm scared go read the book right go get the book and find out what the light what does that light mean are we out of fuel what is going on are we going to crash what is happening hey we're in the days of noah praise the lord i know where i'm at and his thoughts towards me are thoughts of peace his thoughts towards me is not thoughts of wrath praise god amen and he saw that every imagination of the thoughts of his heart was only evil continually and it repented the lord that he had made man on earth and it grieved him at his heart how wicked does it have to be before god is grieved in his heart that he created us we're not there yet now the light's coming on but we're not there yet and god because there was no one greater that's what hebrews said he said there is nobody greater than me he says i will destroy man which i have created from the face of the earth both man and beast and the creeping thing and the falls of the air for it repenteth me that i have made them but god is not slack concerning his problem promises because as one day is as a thousand years of the lord so is a thousand years as one day he does not want anyone to be lost even though this world is going insane but we don't care because it's a flashing light it's scriptures being fulfilled and we should be rejoicing in that amen amen so look at what he says in verse i love verse 8 i've always loved verse 8 it says but noah found grace in the eyes of the lord god looked down at poor old noah and he said because noah will ch will raise his children right because noah will try to do the right thing every time given the opportunity because noah has a pure heart because noah no i love you that's what grace is i love you and i'll pick you up and i'll make you into a sign i'll make you into an everlasting sign i'll make you i want you to build an ark what's an ark i'll show you what an ark is i will and everybody that believes what you say everybody that believes how you live everybody that believes and watches you and comes in that ark they will be saved praise the lord god fulfilling his word amen and who's going to be the president who's going to what are they going to do next what do they do praise the lord amen now i love the book of daniel let's go over here and um you know let's go back to matthew 24 because i gotta read matthew 24 first amen in matthew 24 so now watch so he says well let's just start at verse 38. so he says for as in the days that were before the flood they were eating and drinking marrying and giving in marriage until the day that noah entered in the ark and knew not until the flood came and took them all away and so shall also be the coming of the son of man be so we know that brother branham in the five junctions of time he preaches he says so in the in that day what day in in noah's day before noah's day he says we find out that they begin to work with copper then they begin to work with metal and look today they're even making chips and planes and everything else metal workers great intelligence a great time in school a great educational program just before the end of the world and jesus christ when he was here on the earth he said as it was in the days of noah so shall it be in the coming of the son of man we're here look at the world i was talking with mrs wood and mr wood today we were eating dinner upon we were talking about divorce cases and things in the united states and we have the highest rate of divorces than all the world put together we have more divorces i imagine now we don't have many divorces like they had back in 1956 because nobody gets married anymore [Laughter] you can just sign a prenuptial or whatever and cohabitate or whatever you know men the bible said they would be marrying and giving in marriage eating and drinking the morals and so forth that they'd have and how that they are marrying and giving and marrying marriage in reno nevada men go out live with a girl they marry that girl they take her for his wife live with her for a few days he don't like her he kicks her off without the courts ungodly people give him a divorce and a license to marry again another but god says that is wrong that's right but they will do it our civilization is crumbling we are that it's a sign a post that we're at the end time amen now when i worked in livonia at our second facility i met a whole bunch of muslim guys great bunch and i learned a lot from these muslim men but one of the most interesting one was a young man that i met back in the shipping department and he was telling me how that his father had been married 14 times i said what how's that work he said he said well he says you go down before the amman that's the muslim priest and you get married and he says if your wife disobeys you and she don't do what you say do you can take her right back down there you can put her away and get another one i said wow and he had some thing i think he was looking on his third one i go i said i don't i said how many kids you got see it's a sign it's a sign friends it's a sign so he said that would that's and jesus put it right in the scriptures he says marrying and then giving or giving somebody to get married again and they're already married that's what married and giving and marriage means until the day that noah entered into the ark and they knew not until the flood came and took them all away because that's what peter said he said right they saw the world but they had no respect for god they had no respect for his laws they had no respect for his word they they didn't believe it when he said god's going to judge you for this he's coming he's going to bury the place in water you either get in the ark ah boat look we got titanium we got metal that can handle the stress and you're building a boat out of bolts of wood how's that going to work doesn't matter that was their prescription that was what god said and if he'd had never pitched it on the inside and the out it still would have float because it was god's word you've got to start believing what god has written about you you are the light in the age in this hour amen there should be two in the field and one should be taken and the other one left two women should be grinding at the mill the one should be taken the other one left watch therefore for you know not what hour your lord is coming but there will be signs but know this that if the good man of the house had known and what watched the thief was coming he would have watched and would have not have suffered his house to be broken up and they hadn't even recorded they didn't even create ring doorbells but you know what friend you have no idea when jesus is coming and there's nothing you can do about it because if you would have known when that guy was going to break into your house you would have been awake you'd have been there you might even had the police hiding in the bushes but jesus isn't coming that way but if you know the biblical signs then you go ah okay i'm with this i got it therefore be ye also ready for in such an hour as you think not the son of man is coming who then is a faithful and a wise servant whom his lord hath made ruler over his household to give them meat in due season blessed is that servant whom his lord when he cometh shall find so doing verily i say unto you that he shall make him ruler over all of his goods but enough that evil servant so say in his heart my lord delayeth his coming and he doesn't tell you about the signs and he don't tell you what hour you're living in and then he begins to smite his fellow servants and to eat and drink with the drunken becomes slothful and sin don't matter no more and everything he starts to fall asleep in the night because they drink in the night they're drunken in the night they sin in the night and he says if they do that the lord of that servant shall come in a day when he looketh not for him and in an hour that he is not aware of and shall cut him asunder and appoint him his portion with the hypocrites and there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth and if you go and look everywhere where there's weeping and gnashing of teeth that is the great tribulation and that's right before the raptures right before the great tribulation so it's right in these scriptures right here now and don't really this is this should not make you afraid if you if you are saved that's what you that's the question if you are saved and you know that god is walking with you and you know that he saved you and he changed your life then brother this should just be encouraging you this should really be encouraging i love the book of daniel so we're going to read daniel 12 number 4 or verse 4. so so god and and as we said two weeks ago the book of daniel the thing about the book of daniel the book of daniel is specifically a a jewish prophet that was in babylon which is the gentiles and he interpreted dreams and visions in every dream every vision everything in the book of daniel has to do with the gentile world kingdom and at the end of the gentile world kingdom verse 4 let's start with verse 2 because that's kind of nice he says and many of them that are asleep when the dust of the earth shall awake some to everlasting life and some to shame and everlasting contempt so that's the white throne that's you know the second resurrection and they that are wise shall shine as the brightness of the firmament because they're the children of the day that's you and me and they that turn many to righteousness as the stars forever and ever that's you and me that's us but thou daniel shut up the words and seal the book even to the time of the end wait a minute the time of the end yes when jesus is coming back shut up the words seal the book i close the door no man opens it i can seal a book and there ain't nobody gonna break the lock brother branham said just before he preached the seals he said you know he says i preached the seals many many many many times but he says revelations 10 says that mighty angel came down and he was the lamb that could open the seal nobody else can open them seals this angel told daniel he says you shut up the book you seal it even to the time of the end and i'm going to give you a sign when you're at the end many shall run to and fro and knowledge shall be increased and daniel said okay and i looked and behold there stood two angels one on this side of the river and one on the other side of the river and the one on the one side he was clothed with linen which was upon the waters of the river he said and i said he said how long shall it be to the end of these wonders when is the end time and i heard the man clothed in linen which was upon the waters of the river when he held up his right hand and his left hand unto the heavens and swear by him that liveth forever that it should be for a time times and a half and when he shall have accomplished to scatter the power of the holy people all these things shall be finished that's we know that's tribulation and and then i heard but it was sealed see i didn't understand it was sealed i couldn't understand it i no no no no don't don't stop tell me what's in the book tell me oh my lord what shall be the end of these things when are you coming back what's going on when is jewish when is everything going to be finished and he said go thy way daniel for the words are closed up and sealed till the time of the end so let's see what did he tell him there what'd he tell him time of the end many shall run to and fro and knowledge shall be increased so i looked here are some things for you to think about really the industrial revolution started around 1760. prior to 1760 think about that 1700 years the world never moved forward created the wheel and they created fire and they had metal and they had chariots and they had horses but they never moved any farther around 1700 they discovered steam and the industrial revolution started everything just started to take off like really crazy in the 1890s so we started the industrial revolution started in the 1760s and united states was born in 1776 right so they but see when they had the the war they were still shooting with cannons they were shooting with guns that were handmade every gun was handmade so the flint's on this gun wouldn't go on this gun and this barrel you couldn't take it off here and put it on you know i know it's all about this and all this stuff nothing it would it just it just was stagnant but in the 1890s towards the after the civil war man started to experiment with gas-powered engines horses were the primary means of transportation as they had been since the time of the romans wow the problem was rapidly worsening worsening an estimated 150 000 horses lived in new york city alone and produce an average of 22 pounds of manure every day george warning junior new york street cleaning
