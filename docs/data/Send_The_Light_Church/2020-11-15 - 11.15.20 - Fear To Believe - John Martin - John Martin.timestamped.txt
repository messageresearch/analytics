[14:39] matter what epidemic's going on
[14:41] his truth will march huh hallelujah to
[14:44] we're out of here
[14:45] amen well i just like to change your
[14:47] order of service amen
[14:49] there's no prayer request but i know
[14:50] there's many things on everybody's
[14:52] hearts
[14:53] whether it be just a few of us where
[14:56] people
[14:57] are under
[15:01] a cloak of uh concern
[15:05] for their health and for spreading
[15:09] this um
[15:14] you know just it just it just came to me
[15:17] you know
[15:18] that sometimes we are more concerned
[15:21] about
[15:23] covid and the things of it than we are
[15:25] about spreading the word of god
[15:30] and it's really a shame
[15:36] that we're concerned about ourselves and
[15:38] not others
[15:41] we there is a truth to all that
[15:44] but it's in it's in prayer that you find
[15:46] the answer
[15:48] you men don't know i said that but uh
[15:51] it's truth so i see the baptismal here
[15:55] is our is our sistine baptized
[16:12] she wants to be here she apologizes
[16:15] again
[16:16] she was dealing with things with her
[16:17] last weekend and
[16:19] she said she is still playing
[16:24] okay well that's that that's fine
[16:27] you know i mean the one thing that we
[16:29] all have to do is press forward
[16:31] and i see that in our sister you know
[16:34] she's not letting a a lot of people
[16:36] especially
[16:37] early in their faith would stop and and
[16:40] to say you know this
[16:41] this can't be right because there's so
[16:43] many obstacles coming against me
[16:45] but uh i believe that she has the spirit
[16:48] of lord that just wants her to keep
[16:50] pushing forward
[16:51] into baptism and on with christ
[16:55] so that's really what it is the world
[16:58] wants to stop
[16:59] us from pursuing christ you know
[17:02] but he is greater hallelujah
[17:06] so we thank you for that sister um let's
[17:09] just uh
[17:09] keep uh obviously everybody that's not
[17:12] here in prayer
[17:13] uh keep my son in prayer he's going for
[17:17] an operation i believe
[17:19] uh in a week um kind of being kind of
[17:22] secretive of what's going on but
[17:24] we just pray that the lord will be with
[17:27] the doctors and in the outcome
[17:30] um also for the bailouts
[17:33] i think dennis just went into the
[17:35] hospital
[17:36] um and
[17:41] so i we pray that he gets the treatment
[17:43] that he needs and that
[17:44] his wife is comforted by that crystal
[17:47] and um
[17:49] also for anybody else that's suffering
[17:51] any kind of affliction
[17:53] uh whether it be a spiritual affliction
[17:55] or or a natural affliction
[17:57] amen god is greater than anything we
[18:00] could
[18:02] i mean he created all things what a
[18:05] glorious service
[18:07] last wednesday to
[18:10] get a grasp of who he really is
[18:13] shows you that we shouldn't have no fear
[18:16] if we're in christ
[18:19] amen so let's just rise
[18:22] and just remember our tithes and
[18:24] offerings amen
[18:26] let's just thankful to see our brother

[18:37] missionaries throughout the world

[27:29] and going to extremes to make it safe to
[27:33] make it
[27:33] a place where we can come and feel safe
[27:35] when we come
[27:37] and i'm just speaking in the natural i
[27:38] know our safety is in christ
[27:41] um but we're we're grateful and i just
[27:43] want to say thank you to each of you who
[27:45] are
[27:46] conscious and thinking about us uh here
[27:49] and keeping our church safe may the lord
[27:50] jesus
[27:51] bless you amen uh let's start with verse
[27:55] uh number nine of mark chapter nine
[27:59] verse number 11 i
[28:01] believe verse number 11 of mark chapter
[28:03] 9
[28:04] and they asked him is saying why say the
[28:06] scribes
[28:07] that elias must first come and he
[28:10] answered and told them
[28:12] elias verily cometh first and restoreth
[28:14] all things
[28:16] how was it written of the son of man
[28:18] that he must suffer
[28:19] many things and be set at naught but i
[28:23] say unto you that elias is
[28:25] indeed come and they have done
[28:26] whatsoever whatsoever they have listed
[28:29] it as it is written of him so notice
[28:32] that question that came about the
[28:34] prophet that was to come
[28:35] and jesus talked answered the question
[28:38] with two different prophets at two
[28:39] different times
[28:41] and actually doing two different things
[28:45] and when he came to his disciples he saw
[28:48] a great multitude about them and the
[28:49] scribes questioning with them and
[28:51] straight
[28:52] way all the people when they beheld him
[28:55] were greatly amazed and running to him
[28:58] saluted him and he asked the scribes
[29:01] what
[29:02] question ye with them and one of the
[29:04] multitude answered and said master
[29:06] i brought unto thee my son which have a
[29:10] dumb
[29:10] spirit and wheresoever he taketh
[29:13] he taketh him he teareth him and he
[29:16] filmeth and gnashes with his teeth and
[29:18] pineth away
[29:19] i spake to thy disciples and they
[29:22] they that they should cast him out and
[29:25] they could not
[29:29] notice they could not and he answered
[29:31] him and saith
[29:32] all faithless generation
[29:36] how long shall i be with you and how
[29:38] long will i suffer you bring
[29:40] him unto me notice
[29:43] the answer was faith
[29:46] that was needed to take care of the
[29:48] problem
[29:49] and they brought him unto him and when
[29:53] he
[29:53] saw him he straightway and saw him
[29:56] straightway the spirit
[29:57] tear him and he fell on the ground
[30:00] wallowed
[30:01] uh wallowed foaming so notice this the
[30:04] demon inside of him
[30:06] was recognizing um jesus right there
[30:10] knew what was going to happen just
[30:11] trying to take a hold and he asked his
[30:14] father
[30:14] how long is it a goal since this came
[30:18] unto him
[30:18] and he said of a child and oftentimes it
[30:21] casteth him
[30:22] into the fire and into the water to
[30:24] destroy him notice the motive of the
[30:26] devil
[30:28] and if thou can't do anything
[30:32] have compassion on us and help us
[30:35] jesus said unto him if thou canst
[30:38] believe all things are possible to him
[30:40] that believeth
[30:41] straightway the father of the child
[30:43] cried out and said
[30:44] in said with tears lord i believe
[30:48] help thou my unbelief and when jesus saw
[30:52] that the people
[30:53] came running together he rebuked the
[30:55] foul spirit saying unto him thou
[30:57] dumb and deaf spirit i charge thee come
[31:00] out of him
[31:00] and enter no more into him and the
[31:03] spirit cried and wret him sore
[31:06] and came out of him and he was as one
[31:08] dead in so much that many said
[31:10] he is dead but jesus took him by the
[31:13] hand lifted him up
[31:14] and he arose and when he was come hit
[31:17] the house
[31:19] notice here his disciples asked him
[31:22] privately privately why could not we
[31:26] cast him
[31:26] out
[31:29] and he said unto them
[31:34] because you lacked faith he never said
[31:37] those words
[31:38] and it's important that you understand
[31:40] this
[31:42] the faith that was needed was on that
[31:46] father
[31:53] he said unto them this kind
[31:56] cometh forth by nothing
[32:01] but prayer and fasting
[32:04] something more was needed if those
[32:07] disciples
[32:08] were going to do it
[32:12] and it wasn't more faith that he told
[32:16] him
[32:17] he said just pray and fast
[32:21] but to the father he said oh faithless
[32:23] generation
[32:25] sometimes we need to pray and fast that
[32:27] our faith increases
[32:29] that god hears
[32:32] the earnest of our yearning that this
[32:35] need would be met
[32:38] amen god bless you may be seated
[32:45] you cannot go wrong praying
[32:49] fasting and believing
[32:54] amen but i just like that that
[32:58] that jesus didn't rebuke
[33:01] the disciples she said this kind this
[33:05] type of spirit that we're dealing with
[33:08] we need to fast and we need to pray
[33:12] and if there's ever an hour we need to
[33:13] spend more time with the lord this is
[33:15] the hour because
[33:17] demons are becoming more and more wicked
[33:22] this morning we'd like to take a subject
[33:25] here of choosing to live or to doubt
[33:28] choosing to live in doubt or to
[33:31] live in fear and so i want to entitle
[33:33] this fear
[33:35] to believe fear to believe
[33:40] and we're going to get back into this
[33:41] opening scripture here a little bit down
[33:43] the road but
[33:44] in one way fear opposes faith it's the
[33:47] opposite of faith
[33:49] the bible says that fear has torment
[33:53] fear is when demons torment your mind
[33:57] they prescribe a confinement
[34:01] to your mind now that's what that means
[34:03] confinement it takes your mind and puts
[34:06] you
[34:06] in a spot of hopelessness
[34:10] you're just confined to a situation that
[34:12] you can't seem
[34:13] to get out of and they prescribe it like
[34:16] a doctor
[34:17] prescribing a cure to you they prescribe
[34:20] an
[34:20] in caring punishment to your mind
[34:26] and if you take the prescription you'll
[34:28] stay right there
[34:30] fear grips the mind and confuses its
[34:32] ability
[34:33] to believe for anything better than
[34:35] what's going on
[34:38] fear has literally gripped the world
[34:41] since the beginning of 2020 when this
[34:43] corona virus had arrived
[34:46] i remember we had worked a while as you
[34:50] know working on our waterfall
[34:53] and uh we had put the pumps
[34:56] into the the pond and i remember before
[34:59] the pumps ever went into the pond
[35:01] there's like four pumps that we use i
[35:04] literally
[35:04] feared the day that i would have to pull
[35:08] them out in the fall
[35:11] before they went in i feared that
[35:13] thought oh i ain't going to want to do
[35:15] this
[35:15] i knew how much it was to put them in
[35:16] there and they're very heavy
[35:19] and getting everything just right and
[35:20] settled right and hitting the
[35:21] connections
[35:23] and i just remember brother mark just
[35:25] thinking about this throughout the
[35:27] summer
[35:28] throughout the fall and just kind of
[35:29] fearing the day i'd have to take them
[35:31] out
[35:33] well we took them out this week and
[35:36] it took me uh uh less than two hours
[35:41] i spent all this time
[35:44] thinking about what i don't want to do
[35:48] in the fall
[35:49] for a lousy two hours i spent more time
[35:54] cleaning them after i got it out
[35:55] then i spent taking them out
[35:58] fear has a way of manipulating us
[36:05] my secretary had to unlock
[36:10] the door and come in uh one day this
[36:12] week because she was the first one there
[36:16] and it wasn't really taught to her
[36:19] exactly
[36:21] all the things to look out for when when
[36:23] you unset the alarm
[36:26] so she came in and she hit the buttons
[36:28] but it didn't work and the alarm went
[36:29] off and she was
[36:30] so scared so so afraid and so she
[36:33] she called me and i said well no problem
[36:36] just just
[36:37] relax go sit in the car i'll be right
[36:39] there and i was on my way
[36:41] so when i got there she started telling
[36:43] me about all the police are gonna come
[36:45] and what am i gonna do
[36:46] and and
[36:49] fear had took a hold in that situation
[36:53] this week
[36:55] the police didn't come there was no need
[36:57] to think about it
[36:59] what was going to happen the fire trucks
[37:01] were going to get don't have to worry
[37:02] about it
[37:05] but fear has a way of getting in there
[37:09] and trapping us into a situation that
[37:11] seems hopeless
[37:13] so after it was over minutes over
[37:18] she was still i just need to calm down
[37:23] it i had already done something it
[37:25] reminds me of the time that uh
[37:27] this woman came home this mother came
[37:30] home
[37:32] uh from getting groceries and she saw
[37:34] her children there
[37:36] uh and in the in the and their
[37:38] children's friends were over
[37:39] and they were in this circle in the
[37:41] living room and
[37:43] and she just noticed they were there
[37:46] sitting
[37:46] in a circle and you know kids what are
[37:48] you doing and
[37:50] and uh they didn't respond too much
[37:52] because they were paying attention to
[37:53] what was in the middle of them and
[37:55] and when she got over there she noticed
[37:56] that there were some baby skunks
[37:58] just sitting in the middle of these kids
[38:00] and they were just enjoying in them
[38:02] as soon as she went there she just got
[38:03] so scared and afraid
[38:05] frantically the kids were just enjoying
[38:07] the skunks
[38:10] she got so scared wound up the kids so
[38:12] much that the
[38:13] skunks start spraying
[38:19] so how many times we heard
[38:23] what job feared fell upon him
[38:29] fear can take a situation
[38:32] and make it worse it cannot make it
[38:35] better
[38:36] faith is what makes it better
[38:40] the world's frantically scrambling
[38:43] into a frenzy panic trying to gain
[38:46] control
[38:47] of an unknown germ
[38:50] and this fear has manipulated the way
[38:53] the world
[38:54] even thinks it has thrown hope
[38:58] into a prison cell and given a normal
[39:01] life a death sentence
[39:05] no more normal fear is called
[39:08] such a confusion that the world just
[39:11] doesn't even know
[39:12] what to believe anymore
[39:16] what is really happening when fear is
[39:18] trying to attack us
[39:20] fear is forcing us to predict the future
[39:24] without taking into account the
[39:26] sovereignty of a good god who's always
[39:28] in control
[39:32] friends god is still in control
[39:35] in the the fact that there's nothing
[39:38] that that that ever can happen without
[39:41] god
[39:42] okay god's got a great plan he's got a
[39:46] purpose
[39:48] ephesians chapter 1 verse 11 says that
[39:50] god works all things
[39:51] to the counsel of his own will do you
[39:53] think god's going to allow anything to
[39:55] happen
[39:56] that that he's gonna lose control that
[40:00] fear will prescribe your mind with an
[40:03] incurring
[40:04] punishment that there's no answer to
[40:07] your situation
[40:11] no answer
[40:14] satan is trying to get you to predict
[40:16] your future
[40:19] with thinking that you are absolutely
[40:21] stuck in confinement of your situation
[40:24] no hope nothing to do what do we do
[40:32] fear is a choice
[40:37] who and what you fear is a choice
[40:42] paul told timothy in second timothy
[40:44] chapter 1 verse 7 for god
[40:46] have not given us the spirit of fear
[40:49] but a power and of love and of a sound
[40:53] mind
[40:55] that's the spirit that god's given us
[40:59] god's spirit has not given us the spirit
[41:01] of fear fear comes from the devil
[41:06] the spirit of fear can come to us often
[41:09] and try to confuse our minds try to get
[41:12] us in
[41:13] a spot of i just don't know what to do
[41:18] but that spirit doesn't come from heaven
[41:20] above
[41:22] but that torment comes from the pit of
[41:24] hell
[41:27] now you know there's not a lot of us
[41:29] here
[41:31] so we need to up the amens
[41:34] we need to up them up them
[41:38] did you know that god admonishes his
[41:40] people over 300 times
[41:42] in the bible to not fear
[41:48] god provides all of us
[41:51] with a choice
[41:55] not an excuse
[41:58] not an incurring punishment in our minds
[42:01] that seems to paralyze us
[42:04] when demons come with a prescription to
[42:06] torment your mind always remember
[42:08] that you have a choice in the situation
[42:10] to take the prescription
[42:12] or not to
[42:16] that's why we gotta try the spirit
[42:19] well brother john i don't know how to do
[42:21] that i'm not sure we'll learn get
[42:22] serious about it
[42:24] because they're here to stay i'm telling
[42:26] you
[42:28] those demons are gonna do everything
[42:29] they can to get us off track
[42:33] you don't have to take their
[42:34] prescription
[42:36] you don't have to go get it filled out
[42:42] that those tormenting thoughts that you
[42:44] get
[42:45] can you imagine getting a prescription
[42:46] from the devil
[42:49] every six hours just take these negative
[42:52] thoughts
[42:55] it'll help you feel so rotten so down
[42:59] so depressed you just keep taking these
[43:01] every six hours okay
[43:02] as i prescribe
[43:06] no sir god has not given us the spirit
[43:09] of fear
[43:10] but of power and of love and of a sound
[43:13] mind
[43:16] it's okay that you're not in control
[43:20] god is though that's all that matters if
[43:24] if
[43:25] if you gotta if if you got to be in
[43:27] control of the situation to have peace
[43:29] something's wrong
[43:33] trust that the sovereignty of our good
[43:36] god is in control today
[43:42] david not only knew that the spirit of
[43:44] fear came from hell
[43:45] but he also knew that it was a choice
[43:49] whether he was going to listen to it or
[43:50] not in psalms 23 the great psalms 23
[43:54] verse 4 yea
[43:55] though i walk through the valley of the
[43:57] shadow of death
[43:58] i will fear no evil
[44:03] well brother john you don't know i'm
[44:07] going through stuff he never went
[44:08] through
[44:14] for thou art with me thy rod and thy
[44:18] staff
[44:19] well they take all the fear away
[44:23] why do i need to worry when i got jesus
[44:27] do you think jesus says angels come here
[44:30] you humble around me i'm getting scared
[44:32] right now
[44:38] we need jesus that's it that's all we
[44:40] need
[44:41] we need more of him not up here
[44:45] not on the walls not carrying it
[44:50] we need them right here jesus on the
[44:53] inside
[44:56] there's a place in god where there's
[44:59] peace
[45:01] proverbs 18 verse number 10
[45:04] the name of the lord is a strong tower
[45:08] the righteous run into it and is safe
[45:12] now you have a choice you can sit around
[45:17] in fear or you can run to christ
[45:23] it's a strong tower nothing can get in
[45:25] there
[45:26] nothing can penetrate christ
[45:29] and when you're in him there is no fear
[45:33] because you've got perfect love and
[45:35] perfect love casteth out off here
[45:38] praise the lord fear is being stuck
[45:41] in your own minds i understand
[45:46] that we can't
[45:49] change or control anything that's
[45:52] happened in the past we can't change
[45:54] something that's happened in the past we
[45:55] can't uh
[45:57] we can't change what's happening right
[45:58] now we can't even change what's going to
[46:00] be happening
[46:04] david said in proverbs chapter 30 verse
[46:07] 5
[46:08] he is a shield unto
[46:11] them that put their trust in
[46:15] him
[46:18] so it doesn't matter what happened back
[46:20] then it doesn't matter what's happening
[46:22] now
[46:22] it doesn't matter what's going to happen
[46:24] in the future
[46:27] the the thought that you have a choice
[46:31] to trust the god is going to be your
[46:33] shield
[46:34] that's all that matters
[46:37] that's all that matters i i who was it
[46:40] that i was talking to i think it was
[46:42] brother roger
[46:43] yesterday was talking to me on the phone
[46:44] and he he brought up a quote
[46:47] that brother branham said when they
[46:49] asked brother branham
[46:50] where do you want to be when the bombs
[46:52] are going to fly when when the the big
[46:54] one's going to happen where do you where
[46:55] where's the best place to be where do
[46:57] you want to be brother brandon that's
[46:59] that's what i want to be he says i want
[47:00] to be
[47:01] in the word
[47:04] because they all thought well i thought
[47:06] for sure he'd want to be in heaven
[47:10] no because heaven and earth is going to
[47:11] pass away but my word shall never pass
[47:14] away
[47:18] he is our shield
[47:21] but it's got to be a reality to a saints
[47:24] it can't be something that we just
[47:26] know about amen
[47:29] it's got to be so real that when you go
[47:31] through the test
[47:32] you can stand there knowing there's a
[47:35] shield of faith around you
[47:38] amen brother sister it's an
[47:41] individual affair it's not a world
[47:45] affair
[47:47] i don't care how bad it is out there
[47:49] it's not even a country affair
[47:52] not about who's going to be the
[47:53] president it's an individual fair
[47:57] if most people choose to be in laodicea
[48:00] that
[48:00] nonchalant lukewarm about being in
[48:03] church
[48:04] it's not a church affair it's an
[48:07] individual affair
[48:12] we choose to fear the lord we
[48:15] choose to say amen to the word we we
[48:18] choose to hunger and
[48:20] thirst for the revelation of god's word
[48:22] we choose
[48:23] to believe
[48:28] you know there's a lot of people who
[48:29] walk into church already
[48:31] manipulated by fear before they even get
[48:34] here
[48:37] that they'll have to give up their will
[48:41] even more than they already have
[48:45] oh i don't want to give up my will to a
[48:47] sovereign god that isn't going to let me
[48:49] do what i want to do anymore
[48:52] they're manipulated by fear it's just
[48:55] the
[48:56] devil manipulating us it's a fear
[49:01] and god has not given us that spirit of
[49:04] fear
[49:05] so you know what they'll do they'll put
[49:07] up a wall and i've seen it many times as
[49:10] a minister
[49:11] a strong wall a strong will
[49:16] a hard heart a wall so strong that
[49:20] nothing
[49:20] can squeeze it and make it cry
[49:24] you know what's happening their mind is
[49:26] in confinement
[49:28] they've made up their mind
[49:31] don't accept that incurring punishment
[49:35] into your mind don't let the demons
[49:38] prescribe
[49:38] some torment to your mind
[49:41] that you're you're stuck always remember
[49:45] you have a choice
[49:47] to what the devil is trying to prescribe
[49:50] to you
[49:51] he that the son has set free is free
[49:54] indeed praise the lord
[49:58] and such an unstable and confusing hour
[50:00] that we're living in
[50:02] always remember peace is available to us
[50:06] how do you know that brother john
[50:07] because jesus himself said in saint john
[50:09] chapter 14 verse 27
[50:11] peace i leave with you my peace i give
[50:15] unto you
[50:16] not as the world giveth well everything
[50:18] got to have the right president
[50:19] coleman's got to be gone the economy has
[50:21] got to be good the stocks got to be up
[50:23] my future's got to be bright
[50:25] that's the kind of peace the world gives
[50:27] you
[50:29] let not your heart be troubled neither
[50:32] let it be afraid
[50:34] it's a choice it's a choice
[50:38] you've got the fear to believe
[50:42] when your mind becomes flooded with
[50:44] fearful faults
[50:45] i say get on your knees don't sit there
[50:48] and say like
[50:49] i don't know what to do i can't say this
[50:51] i'm being really bothered get on your
[50:52] knees
[50:53] do something about it psalms 34 verse 4
[50:57] says
[50:57] i sought the lord and
[51:01] he heard me and delivered me
[51:04] from all my fears
[51:08] there's the key right there god wants
[51:10] you to actually
[51:11] do something in this battle
[51:15] if people would just humble themselves
[51:17] more and fear
[51:19] the lord instead of fearing
[51:22] the devil
[51:26] when fear is bothering you just humble
[51:28] yourself psalms 118 verse 5 i called on
[51:32] i called upon the lord in distress
[51:35] the lord answered me and he set me in a
[51:39] large place the lord is on my side i
[51:43] will not fear
[51:46] what can man do unto me
[51:52] who's on your side today well i don't
[51:55] feel
[51:56] like he is no number one we don't go by
[51:58] feelings
[51:59] but if you actually get on your knees
[52:01] and pray long enough you will feel his
[52:03] presence and
[52:04] he will not lie he will tell you you're
[52:06] in the palm of my hands i know the
[52:08] thoughts i think towards you
[52:09] he that have begun a good work in you is
[52:11] going to finish it
[52:14] but you can't stay there in the flesh
[52:16] and just expect god to cater to you god
[52:19] don't have spoiled children today
[52:24] i like the question that paul asked the
[52:27] church
[52:27] in rome in romans chapter 8 verse 31 he
[52:30] said
[52:31] what shall we say what shall we then say
[52:34] to these things if god
[52:36] before us who can be against us
[52:39] who
[52:45] when you sink your teeth into that
[52:50] your mind cannot be a playground for the
[52:53] devil
[52:56] when fear tries to paralyze you remember
[52:59] who
[52:59] you belong to
[53:02] isaiah 43 verse 1 but now thus saith the
[53:06] lord the
[53:08] that created you
[53:11] o jacob and he that formed you
[53:15] o israel fear not for i have redeemed
[53:18] thee
[53:19] i have called thee my name thou art mine
[53:22] that's troubles that nothing else
[53:26] matters
[53:29] the message from god to his people is a
[53:32] continual theme throughout the bible
[53:36] deuteronomy chapter 31 verse 6 be strong
[53:40] and be of good cure courage fear not
[53:44] nor be afraid of them amen
[53:47] greater is he that's in you than he
[53:49] that's in the world
[53:50] amen be not afraid of them for the lord
[53:52] thy god
[53:53] he it is that doeth uh doth go with thee
[53:57] he will not fail thee nor forsake thee
[54:02] it's an individual affair
[54:08] some do not have faith
[54:11] to believe and that's why jesus said if
[54:15] thou
[54:15] canst believe all things are possible
[54:20] choose to believe god is the keeper do
[54:23] you believe
[54:24] that isaiah chapter 26 verse 3
[54:27] thou will keep him in perfect peace
[54:30] whose mind is stayed on thee
[54:32] why because he trusteth in thee you're
[54:35] trusting in something
[54:40] well i don't feel like i trust the lord
[54:42] brother john
[54:44] and i certainly don't trust the devil
[54:48] you know what you're doing you're
[54:49] trusting you
[54:52] you don't realize it but you are and
[54:55] when you trust in you you're trusting in
[54:57] the devil
[54:59] because you're leaning to the arm of
[55:00] flesh
[55:05] there's only two spirits
[55:08] he will keep the imperfect peace whose
[55:10] mind is stayed on the lord
[55:11] because you trust in the lord amen
[55:16] if uh if you keep
[55:20] your thoughts on the world and the
[55:22] troubles of the world
[55:25] and the news of the world and how
[55:29] a people are changing you know what's
[55:31] happening
[55:33] you know this virus has mutated
[55:37] i think at least 10 times from what i
[55:39] understand
[55:42] do you know this corona fear virus has
[55:46] mutated ten times too
[55:51] if it can't get you here it'll come over
[55:53] here if it can't get you here it'll
[55:55] mutate
[55:55] over here and somehow it's trying to
[55:58] attack
[56:00] the church trying to attack us
[56:06] keep your mind stayed on the lord
[56:09] remember
[56:09] who's holding you
[56:13] the world's falling apart but god's
[56:15] holding on to his bride
[56:18] john chapter 10 verse 29 my father which
[56:21] gave
[56:22] them me is greater than
[56:25] all and no man is able to pluck them out
[56:29] of my father's hand
[56:31] hallelujah isaiah chapter 41 verse 13
[56:35] for i the lord thy god will hold thy
[56:38] right hand
[56:39] saying unto thee fear not i
[56:42] will help thee now it's a promise
[56:46] now god can't do it unless you believe
[56:51] you got to believe what is he doing
[56:55] what what do you what did you do with
[56:57] your children
[56:59] mark you don't understand this yet but
[57:00] you will do this you and sister anne
[57:04] when you have children you teach
[57:07] them to believe in you
[57:13] to listen to you to follow your
[57:16] instructions
[57:18] we were at the brother
[57:22] uh other stands
[57:25] brother's funeral on
[57:30] was that thursday that was thursday
[57:34] and uh before the funeral i was watching
[57:36] brother stan
[57:38] and there were stratrina's boys
[57:41] were there and brother stan was teaching
[57:44] them how to throw the frisbee got around
[57:47] them and holding them and
[57:49] trying to show them how to do it
[57:53] well god's putting his arms around us
[57:55] and he's trying to teach us to trust him
[57:57] just do it like this put your trust in
[58:00] the lord
[58:03] he's with us he's not going to fail us
[58:06] but if we keep i don't know
[58:10] like a little child i don't want to do
[58:13] it like that
[58:16] i'm going to be like thomas i got a
[58:19] before i believe it
[58:23] you'll be blessed but you'll be more
[58:24] blessed if you can take god at his word
[58:27] amen just just do what he says to do
[58:35] tell you if we were in charge of things
[58:37] all of us
[58:39] we would make major decisions major
[58:41] changes
[58:43] we would not have things the way they
[58:44] are in any aspect of your life
[58:46] your your marriage your home your
[58:50] church your work your neighborhood
[58:55] the city the state the country
[59:00] you would make changes
[59:03] but we don't need to make changes all we
[59:06] need to do is trust the lord
[59:09] that's all we need to do and everything
[59:12] will be okay
[59:15] hebrews chapter 13 verse 5 let your
[59:17] conversation be without covetousness
[59:21] and be content what
[59:24] how can i be content with what's going
[59:26] on right now
[59:28] be content with such things as
[59:31] you have
[59:34] if we just exercise this
[59:38] for he have said i will never leave thee
[59:41] nor for safety
[59:44] so that we may boldly say the lord is my
[59:47] helper
[59:48] and i will not fear what man shall do
[59:51] unto me
[59:58] we're always going to fear something
[1:00:03] one will be reverencing god almighty
[1:00:06] through the choice of free more agency
[1:00:09] the other
[1:00:10] one will be through a torment of
[1:00:12] manipulation
[1:00:14] by an incurring punishment to the mind
[1:00:16] over and over
[1:00:17] again just like goliath did when he came
[1:00:21] out
[1:00:22] to the armies of god and he defiled them
[1:00:24] for
[1:00:25] a month or two or whatever it was just
[1:00:28] coming out there
[1:00:29] day after day with this in caring
[1:00:31] punishment of torment
[1:00:33] come on see if you can beat me
[1:00:38] and it just put them such in a a mind of
[1:00:42] just hopelessness
[1:00:46] but david chose not
[1:00:49] to fear
[1:00:54] those other ones had choice but you know
[1:00:56] they probably did not want to spend
[1:00:58] enough time with the lord
[1:01:01] because they were that was israel that
[1:01:03] was the people of god
[1:01:04] they knew jehovah
[1:01:08] you've got to spend time with god faith
[1:01:11] cometh by hearing
[1:01:12] and hearing by god god's got to speak it
[1:01:14] to you that's why i say it's an
[1:01:15] individual affair
[1:01:19] luke chapter 12 verse 4 luke chapter 12
[1:01:22] verse 4
[1:01:25] it's a choice jesus said and i say unto
[1:01:28] you
[1:01:29] my friends and i say unto you
[1:01:33] my friends be not afraid
[1:01:36] of them that kill the body
[1:01:40] and after that have no
[1:01:43] more that they can do
[1:01:48] don't be afraid of the person that can
[1:01:50] kill your body
[1:01:53] but i will forewarn you
[1:01:56] whom you shall fear
[1:02:01] fear him which after he have killed
[1:02:04] have power to cast into hell
[1:02:09] yea i say unto you fear him
[1:02:13] amen
[1:02:16] there is the choice that we have every
[1:02:19] single
[1:02:20] time we come into church
[1:02:25] in other words you're going to pay
[1:02:27] attention to one another because there's
[1:02:28] only two spirits
[1:02:31] god has not given us the spear of
[1:02:32] torment god has given us
[1:02:34] the spirit to reverence him
[1:02:38] i want you to catch this to reverence
[1:02:41] him
[1:02:42] when you believe you reverence
[1:02:46] you don't walk around oh yeah i got this
[1:02:48] great
[1:02:49] revelation nothing can bother me
[1:02:53] there's no humility in that god's not in
[1:02:57] that type of a spirit
[1:03:00] it's a reverence it's an unworthiness
[1:03:03] it's a humbleness that's right
[1:03:08] matthew chapter 10 verse 28
[1:03:12] matthew says the same thing but just in
[1:03:15] a little bit different way and i want
[1:03:17] you to catch it and fear
[1:03:18] not them jesus said which killed the
[1:03:20] body but are not
[1:03:22] able to kill the soul
[1:03:25] but rather fear him which is able to
[1:03:28] destroy both soul
[1:03:30] and body in hell again
[1:03:33] god telling us to make a choice
[1:03:38] to fear him
[1:03:41] to reverence him not out of scared in
[1:03:44] torment now before i knew god
[1:03:47] i didn't want to go to hell and i was so
[1:03:49] scared of god
[1:03:54] but that ain't the fear that god's
[1:03:55] talking about
[1:03:57] he saw i believe so strong in you lord
[1:04:03] it's a quiet confidence faith
[1:04:06] i reverence you lord i believe your word
[1:04:10] lord
[1:04:14] knowing the terror of the lord we
[1:04:17] persuade men amen
[1:04:20] oh death where is i sting oh grave where
[1:04:24] is thy victory praise the lord
[1:04:27] we don't have to worry about death
[1:04:30] i'd like to go back to our opening
[1:04:31] scripture at least just to
[1:04:33] in starting with verse number 22
[1:04:36] but you can see this father's
[1:04:39] desperation for his child
[1:04:41] the devil is trying to destroy him
[1:04:44] and the father was was being manipulated
[1:04:48] by the situation himself
[1:04:50] over and over again in this incurring
[1:04:53] punishment to his mind
[1:04:55] in verse 22 let's pick it up and
[1:04:57] oftentimes
[1:04:58] it casteth him into the fire
[1:05:01] into the waters to destroy him now
[1:05:04] notice this but if
[1:05:06] thou canst do anything have compassion
[1:05:09] on us
[1:05:10] and help us
[1:05:13] now notice the father was putting some
[1:05:16] drastic
[1:05:17] measures on jesus if thou canst
[1:05:20] do anything
[1:05:26] what do you mean if thou can't do
[1:05:28] anything
[1:05:30] he can do anything except
[1:05:34] fail
[1:05:36] and he said have compassion
[1:05:39] jesus is full of compassion
[1:05:43] but notice how this man
[1:05:46] was approaching and help us
[1:05:52] i want you to notice jesus didn't get
[1:05:56] manipulated
[1:05:57] by him
[1:06:02] jesus put it right back unto the father
[1:06:09] i'm not moving on this situation until
[1:06:12] you reverence me
[1:06:14] i'm not going to help until you fear me
[1:06:18] that i am able to do this for you
[1:06:23] look into the word jesus said unto him
[1:06:25] if thou canst believe
[1:06:27] all things are possible to him that
[1:06:29] believeth
[1:06:31] he put it right back on him
[1:06:37] god puts it right back on us wherever
[1:06:40] we're at whatever we want
[1:06:42] however we want to grow in christ
[1:06:43] whatever we're facing
[1:06:45] he puts it right back on us
[1:06:49] you know we can look at god sometimes
[1:06:51] like this man looked at god
[1:06:53] bringing our strong reasonings to jesus
[1:06:56] showing forth our just
[1:06:58] cause
[1:07:00] god have compassion on us
[1:07:04] like questioning his ability
[1:07:09] when all we got to do is learn to spend
[1:07:11] time with him
[1:07:13] get into his spirit get into his
[1:07:15] presence
[1:07:16] let that voice speak to our heart and
[1:07:19] then we'll have faith
[1:07:25] now look at the answer after jesus spoke
[1:07:28] to him
[1:07:29] he just came to the right
[1:07:33] the right mental attitude here
[1:07:36] and straightway the father of the child
[1:07:39] he cried out
[1:07:40] he just broke out with tears and he said
[1:07:43] lord i believe
[1:07:45] but help thou my unbelief
[1:07:49] he was just honest with god
[1:07:53] that's where we get somewhere with god
[1:07:55] is when we can become honest it's an
[1:07:57] individual affair
[1:07:58] it doesn't matter what happens
[1:08:01] to the person next to you
[1:08:05] it matters what happens to you
[1:08:10] brother says if there's only going to be
[1:08:12] one in the city of fenton
[1:08:17] make sure you're that one
[1:08:22] well brother john i as far as i know i'm
[1:08:24] the only one from clarkston
[1:08:27] i'm the only one from flint
[1:08:32] you just have to have that kind of faith
[1:08:34] right
[1:08:35] we want more from flint we want more
[1:08:37] from clarkson we want more from fenton
[1:08:40] but we want every one of them to have
[1:08:42] the attitude if i'm the only one
[1:08:44] i'm going because i believe
[1:08:49] i believe
[1:08:52] we've got to reverence to believe
[1:08:57] that's what this man did he reverenced
[1:08:59] to believe we've got to fear
[1:09:01] to believe are you with me
[1:09:05] god wants us to reverence him more
[1:09:09] and not all
[1:09:13] of our lives issues or what's going on
[1:09:15] in the world
[1:09:17] reverence him not give all of our
[1:09:20] our time and our energy and our thoughts
[1:09:22] all the problems that's going out in the
[1:09:24] world
[1:09:26] i got this and i got this and i got that
[1:09:29] reverence him
[1:09:32] reverence him god wants more reverence
[1:09:36] you know some of us need a lesson or two
[1:09:39] in reverence
[1:09:46] god has not given us the okay to walk
[1:09:48] into his house
[1:09:49] in our flesh that's right
[1:09:55] jesus sees jesus said he that worship me
[1:09:59] must worship me in spirit and in truth
[1:10:02] that's just all there is
[1:10:04] so when we walk in to church in our
[1:10:07] flesh
[1:10:09] we're not reverencing the lord
[1:10:15] now someone that don't know the lord is
[1:10:17] totally understandable
[1:10:20] but we that do know to come into church
[1:10:24] in the flesh
[1:10:24] and expect the music or the preaching
[1:10:29] to get you in the spirit is absolutely a
[1:10:32] slap in the face of god
[1:10:37] to come into this live stream and not be
[1:10:41] prepared for the word
[1:10:43] god is a spirit you want god to meet you
[1:10:45] get in the spirit
[1:10:49] this is god's house it's a house of
[1:10:52] prayer
[1:10:54] it's not a place that we come to
[1:10:55] fellowship with one another
[1:10:57] it's a place that we should come and
[1:10:58] pray for one another
[1:11:00] pray with one another i see some people
[1:11:02] that go in the prayer room
[1:11:04] they're here for a half hour they go in
[1:11:05] the prayer room for about six minutes
[1:11:14] well i did my duty
[1:11:20] come on what did the prophet say
[1:11:24] why did god send a prophet
[1:11:29] god has not given us the right to use
[1:11:31] his house
[1:11:33] for our flesh for our negativity
[1:11:38] maybe for a reputation to be heard to be
[1:11:42] seen
[1:11:45] god doesn't want us to talk in church
[1:11:49] he wants us to praise him to worship him
[1:11:53] to adore him to bow before him to pray
[1:11:56] unto him
[1:11:57] to love him to be more ready to hear the
[1:12:00] word of god
[1:12:02] to come into his house prepared
[1:12:07] every one of you if you were going
[1:12:10] to somebody's house you would be
[1:12:13] thinking
[1:12:14] about some sort of preparation
[1:12:22] and a lot of times you want to bring
[1:12:24] something
[1:12:27] coming over you want to bring something
[1:12:32] some people they come to churches they
[1:12:34] as long as they get here they feel
[1:12:36] they did their duty
[1:12:39] now i'm not knocking where your
[1:12:42] revelation is at
[1:12:44] but i'm telling you there's more to
[1:12:46] reverencing god
[1:12:48] than where you're at
[1:12:53] don't make this a worldly church
[1:12:56] with colonel thinking
[1:13:01] if you want god to accept you get into
[1:13:03] the spirit
[1:13:05] before you enter in
[1:13:09] don't sit there come in and expect
[1:13:11] somebody to make you feel good
[1:13:13] to make you feel like worshiping to make
[1:13:15] you feel like praying to make you feel
[1:13:17] like loving
[1:13:18] somebody friend that's your walk with
[1:13:20] god
[1:13:21] this is where you come to find out where
[1:13:23] you're at with god
[1:13:26] don't make this a worldly church
[1:13:29] no the reverent to god
[1:13:34] god wants more reverence come to him
[1:13:36] already reverent
[1:13:39] enter his house prepared say amen to the
[1:13:43] word
[1:13:45] like you mean it like you're determined
[1:13:47] to leave here
[1:13:49] and do something about it there's
[1:13:50] nothing more sad to me
[1:13:52] that sometimes we come to church we hear
[1:13:54] the word and we go service after service
[1:13:57] after service and we never say anything
[1:13:59] about the message we just heard
[1:14:02] amen can you imagine going to god's
[1:14:05] house god speaking and you the only
[1:14:06] thing you got to say is nothing or
[1:14:08] something negative think about it
[1:14:14] this is god's house
[1:14:17] psalms 89 verse 5
[1:14:22] and the heavens shall praise thy wonders
[1:14:27] oh lord thy faithfulness also
[1:14:31] in the congregation of the saints that's
[1:14:34] where we're at right now
[1:14:39] for who is in heaven
[1:14:42] can be compared unto the lord and among
[1:14:45] the sons of the
[1:14:46] mighty can be likened unto the lord
[1:14:50] god is greatly to be feared
[1:14:55] in the assembly of
[1:14:58] the saints and
[1:15:01] to be had in reverence
[1:15:04] of all them that are about
[1:15:08] him
[1:15:13] so what does this mean to your
[1:15:15] revelation what does this mean to you
[1:15:18] how much does this place that you call
[1:15:22] church how do you view
[1:15:26] what god wants you to do
[1:15:29] well i like what the scriptures tell me
[1:15:32] it's
[1:15:33] it's simple what god god i don't feel we
[1:15:36] can be reverent enough i play
[1:15:37] we we should probably put forth some
[1:15:39] effort every time we come into god's
[1:15:41] house
[1:15:42] to make it real to come into this
[1:15:44] sanctuary
[1:15:45] in the spirit filled with the holy ghost
[1:15:47] ready to receive the word of god
[1:15:50] it's a choice we're out there we left
[1:15:53] the
[1:15:53] news we let the people we let the
[1:15:55] neighbors we left the fall we let the
[1:15:57] internet we let
[1:15:58] everything dictate to us all the fear
[1:16:02] in our minds but we can't come in here
[1:16:05] with
[1:16:06] reverence and godliness and saying oh
[1:16:08] god i love you and i want you more
[1:16:11] what's happening fear is
[1:16:15] a choice yes who you're gonna fear
[1:16:23] this is a place
[1:16:26] where you can know god is here
[1:16:30] you pull that internet up you google
[1:16:32] this you'll find
[1:16:34] 10 different answers about the same
[1:16:35] question that you have
[1:16:38] but god's word is forever settled in
[1:16:40] heaven it is the same yesterday today
[1:16:43] it doesn't change he doesn't lie you can
[1:16:45] depend on the word of god
[1:16:48] if god wants to be reverent today he'll
[1:16:50] want to be reverent tomorrow you can
[1:16:51] depend on it when you come to church on
[1:16:54] wednesday
[1:16:54] [Music]
[1:16:56] it ain't going to change your thoughts
[1:16:58] may change your day may change
[1:17:00] you may feel out of it but god is still
[1:17:02] here
[1:17:03] he still wants to be reverent by all
[1:17:05] those that are around him
[1:17:06] well brother john how do you know that
[1:17:08] go in heaven go in heaven and see the
[1:17:10] angels
[1:17:12] they reverence him they fear him they
[1:17:14] choose it
[1:17:16] you know who does it they that left
[1:17:18] their first habitation
[1:17:21] in fact the bible tells me that the
[1:17:23] angels of god are and can't
[1:17:25] round about them to fear the lord
[1:17:30] they'll come and be with us if we're in
[1:17:33] agreement with that same
[1:17:34] spirit of god
[1:17:39] he inhabits that he dwells with those
[1:17:43] that have a humble contrite spirit who
[1:17:46] know that god expects them to get in
[1:17:48] their spirit before they get into church
[1:17:52] that's someone that god is after he's
[1:17:55] seeking
[1:17:55] looking for someone that will worship
[1:17:58] him in spirit and truth
[1:17:59] i don't know how many times we heard
[1:18:00] brother ron say if we could come into
[1:18:02] church
[1:18:03] with the spirit that we have now at the
[1:18:05] end of the service
[1:18:07] at the beginning where could god take us
[1:18:13] why wait to the end he's worthy of our
[1:18:16] best at the beginning
[1:18:20] and i'm so glad the few of us that are
[1:18:22] here
[1:18:23] i'm not taking any of this in a personal
[1:18:25] way
[1:18:28] this message goes to the church
[1:18:32] i want this message this message to be
[1:18:34] heard a year from now it'll be the same
[1:18:37] as it is today
[1:18:40] i believe in spiritual food due season
[1:18:42] but this is one with the evil is so much
[1:18:45] imposing in our lives we need to combat
[1:18:48] it with faith in god
[1:18:49] choose to believe in god
[1:18:56] did you realize that no matter how much
[1:18:58] you believe that you're predestinated
[1:19:01] if you're not prepared to reverence god
[1:19:04] you're going to miss out what god really
[1:19:06] wants
[1:19:06] for you to do
[1:19:14] without the reverence of faith it is
[1:19:17] impossible
[1:19:18] to please god hearing the word
[1:19:21] with these ears are not the ears that
[1:19:24] jesus was talking about when he said he
[1:19:26] that has an ear let him hear what the
[1:19:28] spirit
[1:19:29] is saying to the church
[1:19:32] hebrews chapter 4 verse 1 let us
[1:19:35] therefore fear
[1:19:38] god give me grace to get this message
[1:19:40] done
[1:19:42] let us therefore fear last a promised
[1:19:45] being left us of entering into his wrath
[1:19:48] and if you should seem to come short of
[1:19:49] it
[1:19:52] well how many times we enter into church
[1:19:55] and think well i'm not going to miss
[1:19:56] anything
[1:19:58] god i'm so predestined god loves me so
[1:20:00] much i'm going to get it all i don't
[1:20:02] have to worry about i don't have to fear
[1:20:03] nothing
[1:20:07] let us therefore reverence him humble
[1:20:10] ourselves more
[1:20:11] believe the word more
[1:20:14] because it's god speaking
[1:20:18] and believe that he's speaking to you
[1:20:20] personally
[1:20:22] it just doesn't matter to brother ron
[1:20:25] what god is saying to brother mark
[1:20:28] or what our brother stan
[1:20:34] or sister linda if god
[1:20:39] our precious brother larry god
[1:20:42] larry is interested our brother larry is
[1:20:44] interested in what god is speaking to
[1:20:46] him because it's an
[1:20:49] individual chur affair not a church
[1:20:52] affair
[1:20:56] the only place that god is looking at us
[1:20:58] at the church
[1:21:00] is that he wants us to be in one mind
[1:21:02] and one accord
[1:21:04] about what he wants to do here
[1:21:08] and he wants all of us to be focused on
[1:21:11] them remember being in class
[1:21:13] and the teacher the professor would
[1:21:15] stand up and say now you listen to me
[1:21:18] focus hey johnny boy pay attention to me
[1:21:23] how many times we watch something kids
[1:21:25] are playing around and the teacher would
[1:21:27] call them out oh yeah you weren't
[1:21:28] listening were you
[1:21:31] well god is here and he's speaking to
[1:21:34] each one of us
[1:21:35] the same message but it's an individual
[1:21:38] fear who's going to receive it
[1:21:41] you catching it reverence him
[1:21:45] do not be the one that lets a promise
[1:21:47] slip from you
[1:21:55] we must be reverent when we come to
[1:21:57] god's house
[1:21:58] of prayer let us therefore fear
[1:22:03] last a promise being left us of entering
[1:22:05] into his rest
[1:22:06] any of you should seem to come short of
[1:22:10] it
[1:22:11] that's a very potent words
[1:22:16] we want to leave church with a
[1:22:19] determination
[1:22:20] to walk in what we heard
[1:22:24] how many times have you left church and
[1:22:26] never
[1:22:27] said anything about the word that god
[1:22:30] gave you
[1:22:35] if you leave church you don't say
[1:22:36] nothing there's probably a good
[1:22:38] possibility you're thinking that was
[1:22:39] brother john
[1:22:41] that was just brother john you know
[1:22:43] trying to admonish this tell us what to
[1:22:45] do
[1:22:46] [Laughter]
[1:22:50] again
[1:22:52] when god speaks it's important you know
[1:22:53] when god speaks you just want to tell
[1:22:55] everybody
[1:22:57] because god almighty took time to speak
[1:22:59] to you now i'll tell you a real big
[1:23:01] pitfall
[1:23:02] here's a big pitfall some of us are so
[1:23:05] satisfied
[1:23:06] with god speaking to us we're content
[1:23:10] come on because it's been so long
[1:23:14] since god spoke that we're just happy
[1:23:17] that he spoke
[1:23:19] come on now i've been there
[1:23:22] but god wants to take what he spoke to
[1:23:25] us he wants us to take that word
[1:23:29] and go out there with it do what he told
[1:23:32] us to do
[1:23:33] whatever it is and i'll tell you that's
[1:23:36] what i'll bring the word to you again
[1:23:39] see it's a relationship you're not going
[1:23:41] to hand
[1:23:43] the keys to somebody to the car to one
[1:23:48] of your children
[1:23:49] to drive your car if they can't seem to
[1:23:53] listen to you
[1:23:56] but i'm we all want to drive a car yeah
[1:23:59] i'll tell you that's freedom 16 years
[1:24:00] old you drive your own car you're
[1:24:02] free that's the greatest freedom that
[1:24:04] you feel
[1:24:06] right you're driving away from home
[1:24:09] saying bye to the parents i'm free i'm
[1:24:10] going over my friends
[1:24:16] fear lest a promise be left us every
[1:24:19] promise
[1:24:20] in the book is mine every chapter every
[1:24:23] verse
[1:24:23] every line is yours you gotta want it
[1:24:27] you got a hunger you got a thirst and
[1:24:28] you gotta claim it
[1:24:30] second peter chapter one verse four here
[1:24:33] where here uh whereby
[1:24:34] are given unto us exceeding
[1:24:37] great and precious promises
[1:24:42] exceeding great they're so great they
[1:24:45] exceed greatness
[1:24:48] they're they're so precious these
[1:24:50] promises
[1:24:51] that by these you might be partakers of
[1:24:53] his divine nature
[1:24:54] acts chapter 1 verse 4 and being
[1:24:57] assembled together with them he
[1:24:59] commanded them that they should not
[1:25:00] depart from jerusalem
[1:25:02] but wait for the promise of the father
[1:25:06] saith which saith he ye have heard
[1:25:10] of me
[1:25:13] you have heard of me when
[1:25:16] god comes and he speaks to you
[1:25:19] personally you've heard of
[1:25:22] me you've heard of
[1:25:26] jesus personally and you come in the
[1:25:29] church
[1:25:30] prepared that he'll speak to you
[1:25:32] personally
[1:25:34] you wait on him until he speaks until he
[1:25:37] comes
[1:25:38] i have heard from jesus
[1:25:42] that promise now becomes yours
[1:25:44] personally
[1:25:46] because he spoke to you firstly until
[1:25:49] then
[1:25:50] it's just in a book that you know it's
[1:25:52] true but
[1:25:53] faith has to unlock it
[1:25:59] and you can't just hear with these ears
[1:26:00] you just can't see with these eyes
[1:26:03] it's got to go beyond the natural to the
[1:26:06] spiritual
[1:26:08] amen romans chapter 10 verse 17 so then
[1:26:11] faith
[1:26:12] cometh by hearing and hearing
[1:26:15] by the word of god if you want faith
[1:26:20] god's got to speak it to you
[1:26:24] man can't give you faith i can't give
[1:26:27] you faith
[1:26:28] brother branham can't give you faith the
[1:26:31] five-fold ministry can't give you faith
[1:26:34] only the word and who is the word
[1:26:37] jesus is the word in the beginning was
[1:26:39] the word the word was with god and the
[1:26:40] word
[1:26:41] was god and that's what gives man faith
[1:26:45] the word of god spoken by
[1:26:48] god not by man
[1:26:55] god can anoint men to speak his word
[1:27:00] and all the mysteries have been finished
[1:27:03] god sent a prophet the mysteries are
[1:27:05] done
[1:27:08] but god's got to speak it to you
[1:27:09] personally
[1:27:13] amen hebrews chapter 4 verse 2 for unto
[1:27:16] us was the gospel preached
[1:27:18] as well as unto them but the word
[1:27:19] preached
[1:27:21] did not profit them they came to church
[1:27:26] but they didn't mix it with faith
[1:27:33] they left church thinking it wasn't for
[1:27:36] them
[1:27:37] you know they brought a pitchfork
[1:27:40] or that they already had it
[1:27:44] because they got the knowledge
[1:27:48] knowledge is not what god is looking for
[1:27:50] he's looking for faith
[1:27:58] can you imagine for a moment every time
[1:28:02] that you asked your child to do
[1:28:05] something
[1:28:06] i want you to do this and every time
[1:28:09] they came to you
[1:28:11] and they said daddy i just wanted butter
[1:28:14] fingers
[1:28:16] i just want to dial i just want this
[1:28:19] this this
[1:28:19] car
[1:28:25] so much that they're not paying
[1:28:28] attention
[1:28:29] to what you want them to do
[1:28:32] i remember when we were there and the
[1:28:35] boys were being told
[1:28:37] this is not a playground don't play but
[1:28:40] something in a child
[1:28:42] you know they just want to play
[1:28:46] we all have wants from god
[1:28:50] but when our wants get connected in line
[1:28:53] exactly with what god wants for us
[1:28:56] oh my the promises
[1:29:03] of god are yea and amen
[1:29:07] fear last a promise being left
[1:29:11] behind at church
[1:29:15] don't leave don't come to church be
[1:29:17] satisfied with church
[1:29:20] you might have left a promise behind
[1:29:23] come prepared come in the spirit come
[1:29:26] hungry and come thirsty
[1:29:27] come believing god will meet you verse
[1:29:31] number three
[1:29:32] for we which have believed do enter
[1:29:35] into rest as he saith i have sworn in my
[1:29:37] wrath if they shall enter into my rest
[1:29:39] although the works were finished
[1:29:41] from the foundation of the world this is
[1:29:42] what i like about this god has already
[1:29:44] paid the price of everything that you
[1:29:46] could possibly desire
[1:29:48] out of god the work is already done
[1:29:52] all you have to do is get connected with
[1:29:55] him
[1:29:56] and hear that voice from him personally
[1:30:00] so it just it really doesn't matter
[1:30:02] about anybody else
[1:30:05] it's an individual affair
[1:30:09] it's not them that here it's them that
[1:30:12] believe
[1:30:14] them who are willing to mix the word
[1:30:17] with faith
[1:30:18] them who are willing to prepare
[1:30:20] themselves with faith
[1:30:23] i don't want to enter into church
[1:30:26] without faith
[1:30:31] i do not want to enter into church in
[1:30:32] intellectualism
[1:30:35] with my own mindset with my own little
[1:30:37] church with my own little carnality
[1:30:41] god is a spirit and he speaks his word
[1:30:44] he said my words are not carnal
[1:30:49] they're not intellectual my words are
[1:30:52] spirit
[1:30:53] and they're truth they're life amen
[1:30:57] hebrews chapter 6 verse 10 we're winding
[1:30:59] down for god has
[1:31:01] for god is not unrighteous to forget
[1:31:04] your work and labor of love
[1:31:08] which ye have shown towards his name in
[1:31:10] that you have ministered to the saints
[1:31:12] and do minister it may feel like there's
[1:31:16] things that you do
[1:31:17] that are just seem like in vain
[1:31:23] like i had prepared this tank here to to
[1:31:27] get to baptize their sister hope
[1:31:33] oh that old devil came and he said you
[1:31:35] know what that was in vain
[1:31:37] but you know what it's not vain
[1:31:44] well then baptizer that's not it
[1:31:47] god wants to see if you're willing
[1:31:51] to follow him everything he tells you to
[1:31:55] do
[1:31:56] and it may seem to the carnal mind that
[1:31:59] what you do
[1:32:01] for the people of god for the kingdom of
[1:32:03] god can sometimes see
[1:32:05] in vain because people don't appreciate
[1:32:08] it
[1:32:11] because it doesn't seem to make a big
[1:32:13] difference spiritually in somebody's
[1:32:14] life but i want you to know something
[1:32:17] god is not forgetful
[1:32:20] god is not forgetful he's not going to
[1:32:23] forget
[1:32:24] your work your labor of love
[1:32:27] which you have showed towards the name
[1:32:31] of jesus christ
[1:32:33] if you do it in the name of the lord it
[1:32:35] can never be in vain
[1:32:37] it's only when you do it in your name
[1:32:42] i can see why you'd be discouraged you
[1:32:43] didn't get it out of it what you wanted
[1:32:46] maybe you didn't get the recognition
[1:32:48] popularity
[1:32:50] the pat on the back the parade
[1:32:55] the money the whatever
[1:33:01] god is going to forget you nor your
[1:33:03] labors verse 11
[1:33:04] and we desire that every one of you do
[1:33:06] show the same
[1:33:07] diligence to the full assurance of hope
[1:33:11] unto the end
[1:33:15] whoa this just isn't for the fivefold
[1:33:18] ministry
[1:33:20] every one of you do show the same
[1:33:23] diligence not half as much
[1:33:28] not 75 amen
[1:33:32] full assurance of hope unto the end
[1:33:36] hallelujah verse 12 that ye be not
[1:33:38] slaughterful
[1:33:41] but followers of them who through faith
[1:33:45] and patience inherit the promises
[1:33:50] we're all following somebody
[1:33:54] you may not believe that but you are
[1:33:56] you're following
[1:33:58] some body you're following
[1:34:02] some example you're listening
[1:34:05] to someone
[1:34:09] and it could be a combination of a
[1:34:11] number of different people
[1:34:13] but you are make sure
[1:34:17] that the person you're following has
[1:34:19] exercised
[1:34:20] faith and patience to get the promise
[1:34:29] because anything else you're gambling
[1:34:34] well brother john in my life i don't
[1:34:36] know anybody
[1:34:37] i don't see anybody i don't have anybody
[1:34:42] well you got a prophet god sent a
[1:34:44] prophet
[1:34:50] you got paul
[1:34:55] you got the book of acts
[1:35:01] make sure you're following them
[1:35:04] make sure you're following them
[1:35:07] make sure that you're following the
[1:35:09] spirit
[1:35:11] that's leading you to become more like
[1:35:14] jesus
[1:35:15] [Music]
[1:35:16] don't be following the spirit that says
[1:35:18] that's okay you don't have to do that
[1:35:19] don't worry about that let that go it's
