only believe only believe oh believe amen Jesus is here Jesus is here Jesus is here now all things are possible Jesus is here do you believe this Jesus is here Jesus is here all things are possible Jesus is here amen Let's Just Praise the Lord because he's here amen am just think he chose to be invisible all the time if he was if he was always in the form of someone you could see then you wouldn't need as much Faith you wouldn't need Faith but he wants us to believe amen well there a thinking about that thought that brother um Bruce made about life is full of Trials and then we die like uh so what's it all about it's amazing to me that God takes every one of our Lives that's full of Trials and he uses those as tools to build character his character inside of us and we know everybody the whole the world goes through trials but they don't get character they get bitter they get upset they blame God but to the believer they know God is working something inside of them amen and so it's a it's a paradox amen amen I say good morning to all of you God bless you it's so good to see sister Trina and brother Jonathan sister Gabrielle it's just seems like it's been a while and it's uh good to to have part of the family of God back amen if you would turn with me this morning we got two scripture readings one in Ephesians chapter 4 and then one in 1 Peter chapter 5 this morning we want to talk about about the office of a pastor this a couple years ago that I actually got the thought on this and I don't know what it was I just kind of I put it aside and then it just seemed like the Lord uh brought that thought to me and I went back and I thought yes I I did I did some some some notes on this and I just some thing I want to dig into is just the office of of a pastor and I want to I want to speak about our relationship I believe that we're spiritually connected in a very unique relationship amen before we begin reading let's look to the Lord in a word of prayer our heavenly father we want to thank you this morning that you've given us breath the Breath of Life strength and health to be here here Lord we thank you for giving us that that we could be in your house and we humbly pray that your presence would come in a very special way to every heart may they feel your presence may they know you're here and may you lift them up strengthen them and direct their lives Heavenly Father we ask that you would remember every need that would be among us Lord those that we're aware of those that were're not aware of amen and that you would come and bring victory for we ask these things in Jesus Christ's name amen amen Ephesians chapter 4 starting with verse number 11 and he gave some Apostles and some prophets and some evangelists and some pastors and teachers for the perfecting of the Saints for the work of the ministry for the edifying of the body of Christ till we all come into the unity of the faith and of the knowledge of the Son of God unto a perfect man unto the measure of the Statue of the fullness of Christ that we henceforth be no more children tossed to and fro carried about with every wind of Doctrine by the slight of men and the cunning craftiness whereby they lie in wait to dece that just sounds like the devil doesn't it am all right and then First Peter chapter 5 we're going to read the first four verses there have you be seated the elders which are among you I exhort who am also an elder and a witness of the sufferings of Christ and also a partaker of the glory that shall be revealed feed the flock of God which is among you taking the oversight thereof not by constraint but willingly not by filthy lucer but of a ready mind neither as being Lords over God's Heritage but being examples to the flock and when the chief Shepherd shall appear ye shall receive a Crown of Glory that fadeth not away amen God bless you you may be seated love the scriptures amen first thing I want to talk about is God's order God has an order we remember when Jesus fed the 5,000 he had all the the the people sit down in groups of 50 I think it was and then uh he took one little lunch and he prayed over it and uh he handed it to his disciples and his disciples ended to hand it to the people so there was an order to how he did it amen 1 Corinthians 11:3 says but I would have you to know that the head of every man is Christ and the head of the woman is the man and the head of Christ is God so we see that there's even God's talking about a headship there's a a headship so to everything if there is no head it's it it it's it's either it's dead it's dead it you want to get a you want to kill a snake you don't want to chop off his tail he'll keep going right you got to get the head the Bible says that the spirit of the prophets is even subject to other prophets because God is not the author of confusion am so if someone doesn't take charge in a business it will turn into total chaos we've all work for places that just didn't seem to have it together if the head of a home doesn't take his position inside the home it'll become chaotic if a rest a restaurant doesn't have a manager in charge it's going to go down fast and if God doesn't have a pastor for us our lives can spiral out of his will and if God doesn't have a prophet then he would never then we would never be able to know the secrets of God so I want to take a look uh right now at at this at this Prophet God uses prophets to bring his message to the people I'm taking this from Amos 3:7 it says surely the Lord God will do nothing but he revealeth his Secrets unto his servants the prophets that's just the order the way that God does things he's God he he he make up his own rules amen before God destroyed Sodom he revealed his secret to his prophet Abraham before God destroyed the prophets of ba he revealed his secret to his prophet elah before God destroyed Egypt he revealed his secret to the prophet Moses that's right amen and and when God introduced Jesus the uh he introduced him to the prophet John the Baptist he said Behold the Lamb of God that take away the sins of the world he must increase I must decrease amen so surely the Lord God will do nothing but he reveal his Secrets unto his servants the prophets see a prophet is a Seer he sees things that everybody else does not see that's why he's a prophet God lifts him up in if I could say it like this in that office and he lifts them up shows them things he comes back and he tells the people and we just got a Bible full of examples of that Malachi 45 very important scripture here for us in the end times Malachi 45 behold I send you Elijah the prophet before for the coming of the great and Dreadful day of the Lord now he's sending this Prophet before he burns the Earth with fire I I tell you this is not John the Baptist because that was not the great and Dreadful day of the Lord in fact when he showed up the Angels proclaimed I bring you good tidings of great joy amen so this is a prophet that's to be on the planet before his second coming amen and he shall turn the heart of the fathers to the children and the Heart of the children to their fathers lest I come and smite the Earth with a curse boy aren't you feeling aren't you feeling just even America just seems to be going down the tubes and and and the world I mean I believe that we're at the end times we don't need CNN to tell us that something inside now what is this end time Prophet going to do I I didn't hear but I he's going to get the bride ready for a Rapture he's going to catch that secret he's going to let the people know what they need to do to get ready amen he's going to turn the hearts of the Bride back to the word back to Christ the word now before the Rapture happen God Reveals His secrets to the prophets and how the body is going to be changed how their nature is going to be changed the Nature has changed first and then the body don't be forgetting about the nature and just be looking for the body change without the nature change it will not happen because the heart has to turn to God Revelations 10:7 but in the days of the voice of the seventh angel when he shall begin the sound the mystery of God should be finished as he has declared to his servants of prophets so we see here in these scriptures that it is very important to know God's prophets amen and and that without him we just can't come to Perfection amen we just can't come to Perfection now that's that's God's prophets but God has a five-fold Ministry and each one of this five they play a very important part in bringing us to Perfection and I want to take a look at the office of a pastor now and focus on our special relationship or the special relationship that you have with a pastor now according to our opening scriptures the pastor he's supposed to be a good guy God requires the pastor to take the oversight that's the overseer to be aware to look diligently Shepherds uh look for things that others do not not amen their senses are Keenan spirits that seem to develop in early stages they've been trained by the Holy Spirit to look for them and to when they see them begin to develop in the church and and he they've been trained to to know how to deal with them it's kind of taken the the oversight there now Shepherds must take this position on willingly amen with the right intentions the right motives the right objections they can't be they can't be thinking about money not for money that's right or attention or to gain popularity or to gain power or control over people Amen in other words they must have love for The Souls of people not by constraint but willingly that means with restriction control or limitations I'll get into that just a second neither as being Lords to exercise dominion over somebody to be Lord over somebody a true Shepherd knows God's nature is to work only through Freemore agency if people don't want to hear the word it is not the shepherd's job to for Force the word on somebody but if they're being unruly a true Shepherd's going to warn them but never Lord over them if they want to be rebellious which I'm telling you that's real easy to see it's a lot easier to see when you look for it for so many years so there's a fine line between having compassion on somebody's soul and and and and somebody's body and nature that's being uh affected so much by the devil that they don't even care about their soul condition are you with me can you say Amen now the pastor has been placed into an office by the Holy Spirit to oversee the church brother Brandon would make statements like the pastor is the head of the church right he has said that but we know the the holy spirit is the head of the church but God has placed an office in the church for headship and it's through this office that God has ordained to help lead us through to a nature change are you with me because God's not the author of confusion we we've you know before this message came along I've been in churches you know people stand up God told me to say this God told me to do this is what you needed other people stand up saying the same thing it's contradictory to one another it's like having a bunch of churches out there all saying they're of God but they're completely different from one another God is not the author of confusion am but of Peace as in all churches of the Saints the Bible says so a pastor's motive must be to help the flock of God get to where God is calling them right see most people want a pastor to help them period whatever is on their agenda but God has not called pastors to help them God has called pastors to help them get to where God's calling them to big difference God is interested in our souls above everything now understand it's it requires a lot of a pastor patience love care longsuffering forbearance comforting encouragement all these things it requires but the the the motive is to get God's sheep to where God's calling them to and it must remain their motive I believe where God's calling us to is a perfect Unity with Christ we just read it in the scriptures Ephesians a maturity adoption a Perfection perfect love people look at pastors for so many different reasons but I think it's important to know why God has given us a pastor now in order for a pastor to help God's sheep get to where God's calling them from calling them to first he must know where he's calling them to he needs a revelation of that I believe you can say Amen to that brother BR you can't live higher than than your pastor and if your pastor just has a revelation look the reason I'm here is because I want popularity or I want money I want people to look at me I I want to be looked at as a very popular funny uh reputation uh you know you're the congregation is not going to get very far amen so he needs to have a revelation of what his job is and second he must maintain that Vision through I'll say it like this through all the distractions all the distractions that come in a church and all the distractions that come in the sheep's life because they're both distracting I mean how many times we come into church we got so much baggage on us right we couldn't even hear from God we got so much baggage amen and and and and and a pastor must maintain the vision that God's getting through that and not get distracted he must stay the course he must stay faithful to the mission that God has called him to now what is that mission what is the purpose of a pastor now if we did a survey on that one we would get a variety of answers see brother Dennis knows that's true some might say well he has the responsibility of preaching to the congregation some would say well if there's a problem in the church you know it's the pastor's job to fix it others would say well if I have a problem I just go to my pastor and I expect him to handle it and and and some people like to pick pastors like they're buying a used car you use it for a little bit then you get on you buy another one some pick them like popcorn popping from pillar to pul from church to church amen looking for someone to appease their flesh rather than their soul now I'm really nailing this because we need a revelation God thought about your pastor before the world ever began amen I want that to sink in he thought about your pastor before you were born brother Brandon admonish us to choose our church as if it's the most important decision brother Brandon said that every Christian ought to have a pastor in a home Church a place where he's spiritually fed a place where he pays his tithe he gives offering and he supports the local body that means one another and it is the will of every Christian to do this it is the will of God that every Christian would do this and to also maintain a faithfulness in the church to forsake not the assemblying of ourselves together imagine you were at the times that Jesus was walking the Earth and Jesus chose you as one of the 12 disciples and your attitude toward Jesus was well I'll just show up when I'm I'm it's so when I feel like it you know what I'm saying and I know that we're not living back then and but you've got to feel that calling that he's called you to a faithful walk amen you've got to if you don't hear that then it's just you trying to be a Christian you know God has called us to something greater something greater I want us to think of about God prepared a pastor tailored just for you before you were ever saved and brother Brandon said it like this and this is where I'm getting this from he said stay with your pastor he's ordained of God to lead you through I thought that's such a strong statement such a strong statement that word ordained means to fit in advance to fit up in advance or prepare a for time God decided which pasture he was going to use to lead you to a nature change amen amen he didn't say oh go ahead and just pick whatever you want to pick right we think we picked them but the footsteps of the righteous are ordered of the Lord and God ordained that office to lead you through because he's not the author of confusion you know a lot of times people are so shallow in their walk with God if they don't get what they want they go talk to another brother if they don't get what they want there they go talk to somebody else another sister until they get what they want to hear right and then they wonder why they never grow up amen I want us to understand that it's not the man God did not it's not the man it's the office that God is behind just like uh you know the scripture says um touch not my anointed nor do my prophets any harm you don't mess with God's anointed right amen it's not because their name was William brandham was it you know he only had a seventh grade education and he you know he wasn't much to look at at Society but it was God's man it was God's office so the office of of a pastor is a very intimate relationship with your soul and and and God God is speaking all the time to you he may not call your name a lot of times if we're not in the Spirit we're not paying attention our mind is on other things didn't brother bam say the reason we come to the house of the Lord is to find out where we're standing with God Amen so that must mean he takes that that office and he's going to use it to speak to me now which way spiritually you know some people can come to church and they don't like being there so much they just kind of turn them off and you know what God still speaks in fact I believe this this even if you're not here God's speaking to you but if you're not in your position to receive it it's still on you and I'm just going to say this you know you know how the America but I'll just say the whole world I know you agree with this has has gone down the tubes as far as respect they have lost respect defund the police I mean just killing murdering doesn't matter what happens there're there's respect is going down amen there was a time in life when people would call me they would always leave a message half the time people don't leave a message anymore they brother Roger he knows that you know you know because it isn't like well you know 20 years have gone by and you know what I want to leave a better message I want to make sure I call back I want to make you know it's just down and you know what the it's the same thing but the office that God has given us to lead us through we begin to use that office or look to First we're not even recognizing the office we pay attention too much to Brother John but we start looking at that office of what it can do for my flesh it's not for your flesh it's not it's for your soul amen and that Soul needs a complete nature change so everything that God is dealing with is for your soul now I'm not saying that God couldn't uh uh speak to to you concerning natural needs I am not saying that what I am saying is let's focus on what's important you know we're coming to church and we're forgetting why we're even coming to church like we're not even interested in the nature change I'm saved so what does it matter Lord help us the office of your pastor is the ministry that God has chosen and ordained from the foundation of world to lead you to where God is calling you so I think we just need to ask the question where is God calling me where ises he calling me stay with your pastor he's ordained to lead you through I really appreciate these last couple weeks of messages that we've had I really really have now we know that God can use anyone to speak the word to us right amen God can even use a donkey to get our attention Amen brother Brandon makes this statement rapturing faith lies in the tapes so why in the world do I need a pastor to lead me through if I got if rapturing face and the tapes I mean you might think this is a good question there's something about this office that God has ordained to help you make the right decision amen see a past when it comes to a local body it's a family like it or not a family and just like any family I'm sure every father's had to sit down with his children his wife his wife sit down with the children you may not agree with me you may not like what I'm the rules are but these are the rules of the house this is the rules of the family they do what they want to do in their house we do what we want to do in our house this is just it it is no different than in the Church of God God is not the author of confusion God doesn't want us being children going around from pillar to pillar pillar to PO until we hear what we want to hear God has set up an office so we can get the message he's trying to get across to us and if you know just because you don't want to listen you're going to try to listen to a tape in another Direction I'm sorry God may be wanting to use the office he's given you to speak to you amen we got to get our attitudes right amen you know there's been believers who have done away with the ministry of pastors and just start listening to tapes it's kind of like a a onefold Ministry come on you know what I'm talking about amen it's a spirit but I want you to know that Spirit can get on somebody right inside the church they're still going to church but they're still not listening they've done away with the pastor as I'm just going to listen to the tapes or you know what they're going to pick what Pastor they're going to listen to you know what you're doing you're literally losing you're losing the very Avenue that God has ordained from the foundation of the world to speak to you now I know this is strong but we've got to we've got to keep everything in order the the the prophet has his place the Evangelist has his place every everyone has their place I want to know what God has made the pastor not what people have made the pastor it's important to feel headship you know at our work we work on jobs and and they're very very detailed and there's a lot of details to these jobs sometimes the the prints and the cads don't match uh sometimes instructions that are given by the customer don't match those two sometimes what the boss tells them uh doesn't match and and it's very easy brother Ry to go ahead and just assume something and make it a decision and when you get done find out to make say well I thought well this said and what you need is a headship to take responsibility and it's not scary because if I'm working on a job and I want this thing to turn out that's my motive and I don't know what to do and I think because I've got this experience and you know I own the business I should be able to figure it out my own and I take that chance find out that I'm wrong it messes things up I have no problem calling my customer humbling myself and says I I do not understand what you want me to do amen help me it seems confusing and as soon as he tells me I go and do it I'm happy I don't got Pride that I can't ask but I'm saying there's safety being under headship amen where if you're out on your own there is no safety amen you know some people are just so confident in themselves that they don't need a pastor to lead them now I believe in confidence I believe we must have confidence the Bible says we're we are partake we are made partakers of Christ if we hold the beginning of our confidence steadfast to the end so we need confidence but confidence and arrogance is two different things and our beginning confidence if you just think about it wasn't arrogance no we were like Lord I love you I'm subject to you I want to live for you just just I want to please you well after a while that begins to leave and we think we got it we were humbly trusting God for everything that was our beginning confidence I'm going to follow the word out of Egypt I'm going to follow the word through what I got to go through I'm going to get the Holy Ghost I'm mean business with God you've got to maintain that confidence don't be saying I got enough so there is underconfidence confident and overconfident underconfidence is being unsure uncertain pessim pessimistic indecisive overconfident is having if you look up the definition it is having unreasonable confidence unreasonable confidence being conceeded assuming self assured we could say it like brother ramam said of venturing without Authority and the Leo deia Church the spirit in leoa is filled with overconfident Believers in fact their own testimony is their Spirit now the spirit is speaking this yeah not their words their spirit is speaking this I'm in need of nothing I handle it on my own they don't even know that they're wretched miserable poor blind and naked that that's a testimony of Jesus Christ the very God they're claiming to serve has a different testimony about them now confidence is what we have and that we need to stay with when we have the word of God this is it Heaven and Earth will pass away but this word will never pass away so when you begin to make excuses of why you're not following every scripture with all your heart you're not walking with confidence maybe overconfident now no one's perfect but we should all have a perfect heart of whne to be soon as you step out on that limb well you know nobody can be perfect before you know it everything you're doing is imperfect a little leev leev at the whole lump we don't want to be blazing new trails we just want to stay with the word amen we want to believe with the the prophet said we need to let it be a testimony King Jehoshaphat said believe in the Lord your God so shall you be established I mean what a better world we'd live in if the people's lives were established believe His prophets so shall you prosper amen I don't mean monetarily God can prosper us with so many different things I want all that God had I want to prosper I want to have so much peace it's not even doesn't matter what happens to me throw me in the fire I want to have so much love I want to get kicked all around and still get up and still better love I want to prosper in the things of God now we need to have respect for what the prophet said God has ordained the office to lead us through we need to respect it we need to believe it we need to move forward we need to anticipate when we come to church that we're going to hear from God for our personal Soul the office of the pastor is not just behind the pulpit by the way right just like the office of a deacon is just not in church it's with him wherever he goes now if we can believe God honor our faith the key is being connected to God in the spirit but if we question or doubt God's use of the office we can end up missing God's visitation remember Jesus he was weeping over Jerusalem because he because thou knowest not the time of thy visitation be careful of how you entertain strangers because some of entertained angels unaware I think so often we can come into the presence of God and not even know we're in the presence of of God why because we we got to feel it we got we this is the way I picture God you know what God is not in your little square box God is much bigger and what we need to do is reduce ourselves humble ourselves in the sight of the Lord and then we're going to hear from God have you ever missed an appointment I I mean literally literally I've gone to the doctor's office this didn't happen too long ago and I said I'm I'm here for my appointment and they said your appointment is not till tomorrow or your time was off the time was off the day was off the time God is serious about giving us what we need to to help us get to where he's calling us to I think if we just take the time to Humble ourself and say God what are you calling me to instead of coming to church for our own reasons our own reasons our soul our soul needs to be fed now according to the opening scriptures the first requirement is to feed the sheep and sheep must be fed with what sheep food 100% pure alphalpha word seed must be a balanced diet that's why I'm a firm believer and a five-fold Ministry I am not worried about having to hit all five of them I'm just not I take that pressure right off of me but if I can just do the job he's called me to do you know it doesn't it don't line up with everybody's opinion what I should do how I should preach you know and I'm not here even to try to convince people but if I can just do what God wants me to do you know Jesus did a perfect job did he not amen but what was the Pharisees and the Sadducees and the lawyers and all those guys they were trying to trick them yes if you were really true blue if you were God's you know just something to find some sort of complaint about I like how brother darl he's a great evangelist I might well say it I'll say it when he's living sheep cannot just eat candy all the time they just can't live on that kind of sermon they need meat and potatoes he says that's where the real substance is at and I'm I'm telling you if we don't get back on track to what God has called us to get serious about church this isn't just a place a fundamental place that we come and hang out and you know just say this is where I go and it isn't that it's something more personal something more intimate it's between you and God and God can speak to you and I don't know one thing about it that's what I love about it it's awes awesome God is in control a pastor's job is more with the soul of a Believer than anything else God is calling our souls to get dressed in his character and I believe that's what God has ordained the pastor or the office of a pastor to lead us through what's he leading us through if we're going to make a rapture we first have to go through the nature change that's just all we are not living in the hour saints that all you have to do is be justified we are not living in the hour that all we got to do is sweep up a few things in our life no we have been called to a nature change and we've got to get serious about that we can see here turn with me to Romans chapter 13 can see here in the scriptures how God uses this office to lead us Romans chapter 13 starting with verse number one let every soul be subject unto the higher Powers am H for there is no power but of god the powers that be are ordained of God so if God ordained the office of a pastor to lead you then he ordained that that's his power that's not my power amen it's God's power amen and his in first instructions is just get this carried let's just get this straight let every soul be subject unto the higher Powers God has ordained the office of a pastor to complete to to get us to a complete conversion of the soul of the Soul so whosoever therefore resisteth the power resisteth God the very ordinance of God and they that resist what happens they shall receive to themselves damnation amen that's why I don't believe in manipulation or pressure or or or or or some power control it's through free and more agency God is a god of love I've I've I've I've had people you know I try telling them what to do and they don't want to listen and they just go on that's between them and God Amen God never put me in a position to do anything but to intercede for them to pray to believe that they will they will come around sometime because if not look if you resist God long enough you're just going to receive condemn uh damnation amen for the rulers are not a terror to good works but to evil in other words if you're going to just do nothing but be faithful and be good how are you going to get in trouble for that right wilt thou not be afraid of the power do that which is good and thou shalt have Praise of the same for he is the Minister of God to thee for good but if thou do that which is evil be afraid he beareth not the sword in vain for he is the Minister of God a Revenger a Revenger to execute wrath upon them upon him that doeth evil amen wherefore you must needs be subject not only for wrath but also for conscious sake and for this cause pay ye tribute uhoh now you know I uh um I'm just want you to see the word for this cause pay ye tribute also in other words when God does something for you you ought to say thank you Jesus when God is meeting your needs continually you should say thank you Lord for meeting all my needs when the sun comes up in the morning you should say thank you Jesus for the sunshine thank you for the health it's you're P you're giving paying tribute to whom tribute is due right for they are uh okay uh tribute to whom tributors do custom to whom custom Fear To whom fear and honor to whom honor unfortunately some Believers only want to render any dues when they feel like it but that's not what the scripture says in fact the Bible says owe no man anything but to love one another for he that loveth another has fulfilled the law when you express your love by giving tribute fear honor what you're doing is you're fulfilling the word of God well I don't want to do that because if I do that he's just going to get some big head and he's going to think he's something I don't think the scripture says that if he gets a big head that's his that's his problemen we we're called to esteem one another better than ourselves amen that's what we're called to do he didn't say only esteem others as long as you know they're not going to get a big head I mean we just we just need to start getting serious about the word of God honor the word and God will honor you that's all there is to it you start grabbing from God what you want leaving the rest you're only going to go so far with God I know brother BR talked about the pastors being that Lily and everybody comes the birds come the Beast come they take their little part that's understandable that that's fine but there's a higher calling there is a higher calling I believe God is is calling us that okay Hebrews chapter 13 verse 7 I want to read three verses there verses 716 and 17 remember them which have the rule over you who have spoken unto you the word of God whose Faith follow now consider the end of their conversation the end are they are they trying to get something out of you are they are they trying to get money popularity power control what are they trying to get out of you consider the end of their conversation well I don't got it here but verse eight says that Jesus Christ is the same yesterday T if the end of the conversation is Christ manifested in the flesh then we can have confidence right in those that are trying to rule over us because they're watching over our souls let's Dro down to verse 16 but to do good and to communicate forget not for with such sacrifices God is well pleased obey them that have the rule over you and submit yourselves for they watch for your souls as they that as they that must give an account that they may do it with joy and not with grief for that is unprofitable for you God has ordained the office of a pastor to watch over our soul that's just it and and and and if we we just feel that we don't need anybody to watch over our soul because we're saved we're in big trouble I may not be too hip on the recent trends of the world I may not be up to date on the news or what's happening on the world scene I may not know who's winning who's losing who's being drafted I may not be a great Storyteller I could be probably if I wanted to but just don't want to or having fun behind the pulpit but I will say this I am watching over your soul I am carefully observing your soul now that word watch it really means Sleepless it means to keep awake in other words when you're not here or you're still a a you're still a burden on the pastor's heart so you may think well I'm not there it's not a big deal but if God wants you here and you're a part of this body right our souls may not be something we think about about very much and I'm sure we've had this thought since our soul is already saved we must be okay because we're not Believers that you know we're not saved right we believe we're saved we got I got saved I got baptized I got saved so why would I need anyone to watch over my soul I just want to say it like this it's not he that starts the race but he that finishes it yes amen it's not an automatic over the Finish Line because you repented and got baptized but it's he that runs the race and finishes the C the course now what's the course the course just so you understand it is a nature change it isn't just surviving into the Rapture keeping myself from going into the world I'm sorry that is not the race the race is to become just like him I will not be satisfied to awaken his likeness it does not yet appear what we shall be but we know that when he shall appear we shall be like him we shall see him as he is that is that is the race turn with me well I'm just going to quote it to you 2 Corinthians 511718 you write it down therefore If any man be in Christ he is a new creature old things are passed away behold All Things become new now that one word all that just like just like grips me there's like no satisfaction what about this and this I I got rid of this no everything's got to become like him and all things are of God who have G who have reconciled us to himself by Jesus Christ and had given to us a Ministry now now through this process of becoming more like him he he harnesses us with a Ministry that now we got to go out and share Jesus with other people that's an automatic by the way that is not just for the ministry for those that are called to the five-fold ministry that is every human being who's been changed by Christ now we all have confidence that we started the race Philippians 1:6 being confident of this very thing that he which had begun a good work in you will perform it or complete it until the J the day of Jesus Christ so God is looking for a completion here so we all have confidence that we started the race but our souls must keep running the race no time to slack we got to keep fighting the good fight of faith we got to keep pressing on to that nature change some may wonder why they need to have someone watch over their soul when they're already saved I think that's a good question and I want to address it like I received salvation in in 2012 in in May and it was the 14th I I'll never forget it Jesus came into my heart I got baptized at same day and you know my soul is saved so why do I need someone watching over my Soul that's already saved well did you know the Bible says that May 12 or whatever I said of 2012 is not the day of salvation do you know the Bible says today is the day of salvation amen and if you wake up tomorrow that day is going to be the day of salvation that means God has something for you am we need to keep looking to Jesus who's the author and the finisher of our faith not just the day he saved me well everything's okay no you just started a process Amen brother John are you bring preaching some strange Doctrine no it is the Bible Doctrine First Peter chapter 1: 6 we can put that up on the board 1 Peter chapter 1: 6 look at this wherein you greatly Rejoice though now for a season if need be ye are in heaviness through manifold Temptations right one after another that the trial of your faith be in much more precious than gold that perishes though it be tried with fire might be found into the praise and honor and Glory at the appearing of Jesus Christ notice the trials that you go through if you yield yourself to God and you develop the character that he's calling you to then it will be unto the praise and honor and that he be found unto praise honor and Glory at the appearing of Jesus Christ see it's at the end that he's looking to whom having not seen you love in whom though you see him not we talked about that at the beginning yet believing you rejoice with joy unspeakable and full of Glory now notice there's no period there it's a colon receiving the end of your faith but what is the end of your faith brother John even the salvation of your souls so I'm thankful for the day it started but that day is important amen because the way the tree falls that's the way it lies so I'm telling you when you come here God is speaking to your soul and there and I I I praise God for the fight we get we get missionaries we get evangelists we get we get a variety of people that come here but I'm telling you there is one office that I'm sure that if you're not getting the message some way God uses that office to speak to you he has to because he ordained it and it's up to us to be in tune amen we got to stay in tune amen all right you know what I did start a a little bit late did you all notice that praise God someone's paying attention I need somebody on my side now I know you had a couple services that were lengthy and my beautiful darling wife next to me me this morning said now remember it was last night she said now remember we had two long services and the people don't want to have a long sermon today so I'm very conscious of this turn with me if you would to Philippians chapter 2 now God's motive is to get preeminence in you is that where what first Colossians tells us his desire is to have the preeminence in the church now he can't get preeminence in us until there's a nature change now you can yield to them for a minute and get blessed but until you yield your life and your nature begins to change he really doesn't have preeminence in the church you understand what I'm saying so his goal is to get more and more of our nature changed and as that nature get changed he can now become preeminent and say you're going to do this today we're going to do that we're going to go here we're going to because now he's in charge amen all right so we're changed from Glory unto Glory a little bit every time we come but remember there's a there's a fleshly part of you that don't want this right all right Philippians chapter 2:2 wherefore my beloved as ye have always obeyed not in my presence only but now much more my absence I want you to work out your own salvation with fear and trembling there is another scripture that tells me you know I just can't one saved always saved it doesn't matter what I do that there's something that you actually have to work through now if you remember when you first got saved you had fear and trembling you knew that if you didn't give your heart to God that was it there was no other way to get to heaven so there was that respect okay if this is what the Bible says I need to do if this is my first step then this is what I'm going to do I'm going to repent for my my sins I'm G I'm going to get baptized and I'm GNA ask Jesus Christ to come into my heart you work that out with fear and trembling respect to the word of God Amen it is no different today with today's day of salvation it will be no different tomorrow so we're here in church now but not just in church because it can be happened anytime God speaks to us for it is God which worketh in you inside of you both to Will and to do of his good pleasure now you you know what the best way to not be bothered by God is don't ask him what he wants you to do don't read the Bible don't come to church don't talk to a more spiritual believer than you are talk to somebody carnal so you're not held to anything accountable and you know what you'll go on thinking you know what God hasn't told me what to do God's God will speak to you amen and it'll be in your heart for it is God which worketh in you both to will and do of his good pleasure do do everything that God tells you to do without murmuring and disputing that you may have a testimony they may be blameless harmless as sons of God without rebuke in the midst of a crooked perverse Nation among whom you shine as lights in the world not just at church you don't just put on at church the real light is at home that's the real light that's where that's that's where you find out what your relationship is with God right there holding forth the word of life that I may rejoice in the day of Christ that I have I have not run in vain neither I have labored in vain I'm going to just finish the course so let's stand together so we want to come to church with fear and trembling we want to come with sincere Humble Hearts we want to come waiting to hear from God because we can have confidence that God has ordained this office to lead us through amen last scripture I want to give you it's Hebrews 2:1 therefore we ought to give the more Earnest heed to the things which we have heard lest at any time we should let them slip if God gave them to us it's important it's important that we are faithful with what God told us it's it's not important that you do everything that God told me to do or that you do everything God told somebody else to do it's a walk between you and God God may never ask you to do the things he's asking the person next to you to do but what is important is that you have this intimate relationship with Jesus Christ so intimate that when the word is being preached you hear the voice of God my sheep hear my voice and what do they do they follow me amen they follow me amen let's just bow our hearts for a word of prayer every eye closed every heart bowed no be looking around if someone just in their heart would you remember me in prayer God knows all about it just raise your hand God bless these hands bless these hands God sees your hearts it's beautiful absolutely beautiful think about these words that David spoke one thing if I desired of the Lord that will I seek after all the days of my H my life he said in there to behold the beauty of the Lord I don't know of anything more beautiful to to to witness than the very desires that were once selfish and all about ourselves being changed to want to please God I just believe that's a beautiful thing our heavenly father I believe that you believe that's a beautiful thing too to give you our lives to give you our hearts Lord we thank you for everything that you have ordained to bring us to Perfection you you just didn't

Lord they lifted up their the hand in their heart as it were I pray that you would you would grant that for them as well Lord it is our desire to get to that place that you're calling us to we pray Lord that you'd help us to hold that banner up that you have placed for your bride in this this office of a of a of a pastor Lord help us to be attentive to what you would be speaking to us personally that we may take take it home inside of us and begin to do the things that we can have confidence that you're that you're you're wanting us to do Lord for you you you said you give the Holy Ghost to them that obey so we know Lord that there's o obedience that's it's needed and the more of your spirit we get the more of our nature gets changed and it's just a marvelous amazing work that you are

all be ready in that day for that was what you you spoke be ready in in that hour Lord in order for us to be ready in that hour to have confidence that we be ready in that hour is to be ready the very best that we can today so I pray Lord that we would be ready if there's anyone that just is Desiring the blood of Jesus Christ to cleanse them from the past Lord I pray that you would just cover them with your blood I pray that you just wash away the past they could just have the confidence Lord that they're just moving forward with you bless us now as a body may we just continue to grow more in your image and your likeness to be mature and Lord help us to step up to the plate and help one another really prove what is that good and acceptable perfect will of God lord maybe there are some that are being called to be more faithful to the body maybe some are being called to to go out and share this message this truth that Jesus Christ is alive to other souls for you said they that say win souls is wise and Lord just one really moves Heaven and Earth that they Rejoice amen God whatever you're calling us to may we just say yes to you today we commit ourselves to you as a body of Christ I
