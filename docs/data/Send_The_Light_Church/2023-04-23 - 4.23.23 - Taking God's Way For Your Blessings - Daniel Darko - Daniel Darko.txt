need anything Lord Jesus I pray that you granted we thank you Lord and we'll bless you in Jesus Christ and we pray amen let's take our seat beloved well we are back again this morning and uh the Lord has been so good to rise amen we are living beings with strength in our body and with life and you know there are living things make noise so as we are together this morning uh permit me whoever John was saying that today today is the last meeting for this trip it's true but uh we don't know what the Lord will do maybe we'll continue amen give me a little time to I mean tell about the missions so far the Lord has been so good to us and this church has been a blessing to us brother John in particular um by the grace of God for all these years we have been fighting tooth and kneel to get a place to build our church house uh in fact about 10 years ago we bought a piece of land not a piece but a about two piece of land and we didn't know that there was a problem on the land we gave the money to the people and it was just up and down up and down up and down till today we are so struggling to get our monies back but well the Lord made a way and you have been able to buy a new land yeah brother John helped us very very very well to get that land and uh by the grace of God I am happy this morning to stand in your presence to say that we are almost ready to crack the ground hallelujah sister and will you please put the pictures yes this is where the Lord have given us the erection hallelujah amen yeah yeah yeah and then also along the years um I was able to use the offerings to give buy this for John I think I told you about this this was purposely for the Crusade yeah we bought this in our addition to the instruments that we bought for the Crusade yeah and then also um even though we didn't have our own church house but by the grace of God we didn't want to be selfish there were some other churches that were in our condition our situation but where they are is not like where we are in fact where we are we are in a city we are in a industrial city of our country so everything is expensive so it is very not so easy to get up and do things fast fast but unlike other places that we realized that we could help them by God's grace we push something there to you know help them and let's go to the other picture okay this this is a a sprinter bus that I bought for my church because uh I remember some of the Brethren where they lived and most of them were working apprentices and you know students they don't have the means always to come to church in fact there has been the occasion that um they they work distance before they come to church and uh especially when they are coming into the church late oh they are full of sweat and all that so the Lord laid upon my heart to make a provision for this so by God's grace we have this that is you know cutting them to and through from church Hallelujah and this is um one of the towns are about two and a half hours drive from where I live there is a pastor there who also didn't have church and by God's grace we have helped them to you know Reach This level amen yeah so we are praying to the Lord Jesus that if he will they will soon you know finish and then they'll go in amen yeah and uh on a Bible Mission as I already told you I went to three churches but then I was able to share Bible in only one church because the other one I didn't get the chance but there was another one also that received Bible Consignment last year yeah and they are not requested for it again so this is the church that we were able to share Bibles other strength and uh I have to cut this machine short because I have to go and be with Brazil so that we can go to Malawi you know um in fact I was trying to bring some of the pictures from Allah we buy uh all the all the pictures are corrupted on my phone I don't know why yeah so this is what we were able to do this year and hopefully God willing when I get back we are going to continue amen amen so continue to pray for me and pray for my team also that will always be able to be on the field amen God bless all of us amen so now after saying that we have to come to business yes Hallelujah Jesus said that my father worked heated to and I also work so this morning we are going to work I am going to work and you are going to work hallelujah amen thank you once again for having me brother John and thank you my precious brethren for the love that you have shown to me um whatever that you have you know spent on me I pray that the Lord will replenish your coffers in million fools if you don't like million I'll say trillion amen God bless all of you amen let's just be on our feet at this moment and we are reading uh Joshua chapter 1. Joshua chapter 1 we are reading verse 8 and 9. and then we will equally read First Corinthians chapter 2 verse 16 but first let's take a Joshua chapter 1. and verse 8 and 9. this book of the Lord shall not depart out of thy mouth but thou shall meditate therein day and night that thou mayest observe to do according to all that is written therein for then thou shall make thy way prosperous and then thou shall have good sources have not I commanded thee be strong and of good courage be not afraid neither be thou dismayed for the Lord thy God is with thee with us forever thou going First Corinthians chapter 2. and verse 16. for who have known the mind of the Lord that he may instruct him but we have the mind of Christ the Lord had his Blessing to the reading of his word amen let's take our our seed now this morning we want to talk on a topic taking God's way for your blessing the Bible says that there is a way that cement right unto a man but at the end of it is death and uh If any man will have to come to the Lord he must come by God's way Hallelujah because the broad is a way that leader to destruction but narrow and straight is the way dilated to eternal life and that is where God has assigned all his people to go amen once upon a time when Jesus Christ was asking the apostles or the disciples unless you eat my flesh and you drink my blood there is no life in you the bible say that a lot of the disciples went away and they didn't walk with Christ again because to them it was a hard way how can we eat the Flesh of a man and drink his blood we are Jews we are Israelites there are even some creatures that we don't eat and this man is suggesting that we eat his blood his flesh and drink his blood is he trying to make us carnivals no that was their mind they didn't have the mind of Christ if they had the mind of Christ they'll realize that Christ was not talking about the flesh or the physical but he was talking about spiritual that is why it's good that we believe this we must have the mind of Christ Hallelujah and so when it happened like that and it went away this has turned around and it was left with only that that he chose and he asked them a question will you also go will you also desert me and Peter said to whom should we go where do you think we can go you are the only one that have the words of eternal life therefore no matter what no matter the situation no matter how somebody would think you are the only one that will follow amen and beloved Peter and the rest follow Jesus Christ till the promise that he promised them was made manifested approaching Christ in you amen we have our own thinking as we're saying last Wednesday when we were outside of God's word we still had some part of God within us God had something to do with us that is why we did so many things even in those days and we have some condemnation within us because we had the mind of Christ already in US Hallelujah other than that they wouldn't we wouldn't feel any guilt when we we we we did so many wrong things but because we had this the seed of God within us always when something go wrong then immediately it tricked you it tells you now no why should you do this that was the mind of Christ amen Amen to show us the way to keep us on the way of God and in fact when we take God's way the only thing you get is your possession we all have part in Christ Jesus Hallelujah as he told Joshua now let's read Joshua let's let's uh start from the verse one perhaps Joshua chapter 1 verse 1. now after the death of Moses the servant of the Lord it came to pass that the Lord spoke unto Joshua the son of none Moses Minister saying Moses my servant is dead now therefore I Rise go over this Jordan thou and all these people onto the land which I do give to them even to the children of Israel every place that they saw of your food shall tread upon that have I given unto you as I said unto Moses from their wilderness and this Lebanon even onto the Great River the river who freitans or the land of the Hittites and unto the great sea toward the going down of the sun shall be your Coast now listen to verse 5. there shall not any man be able to stand before thee all the days of thy life as I was with Moses so I will be with thee I will not fail thee nor forsake thee oh what a Blessed assurance if God will call you and tell you this oh man and you go away from this way what do you think you are doing to yourself that is the question it's a blessed he said there will be no man and when God said no man he means no man no man will be able to stand you away and whatever the soul of your feet would trod did this the land that I have given to you verse six he said be strong and of good courage For unto these people shall thou divide for an inheritance the land which I swear unto their fathers to give them only be thou strong and very courageous that thou Mayors observe to do according to all the law which Moses my servant commanded thee cannot from it to the right hand or to the left that thou mayest Prosper with the server thou goes verse 8. this book of the law shall not depart out of thy mouth but thou shall meditate therein day and night that thou mayest observe to do according to all that is written therein for then thou shall make thy way prosperous and then thou shall have good sources foreign be strong and of good courage be not afraid neither be thou dismayed for the Lord that God is with thee with us forever thou goest amen amen oh brother I can equate this to the topic we treated last Wednesday the Angelic protection he is always with us he will not deny his himself the Bible said that God is not a man that you lie amen therefore God always want to stand by his word Hallelujah his word of protection his word of Liberty his word of Freedom his word of redemption his word of salvation all these promises as he promises people the only thing we need to do is to take God's way Hallelujah if you take God's way then of course there is something for you Hallelujah he said blessed are the eyes that have not seen but yet believe take the way of God by inspiration take the Way of the World by by Revelation and when you do that beloved there you see your possession lying for you now no man will be able to stand against you the prophet said that footprint means your possession it is where you put your foot that is where that is what belongs to you in a place that the soul of your feet will trod or will tread God said is the part of the land that he has given to you there will be no man who will be able to stand before you Hallelujah that is God's way Hallelujah that is God's way beloved amen let's let's read uh Deuteronomy chapter 11. Deuteronomy chapter 11 we are reading verse 13 down to establish ourselves Deuteronomy chapter 11 verse 13. and it shall come to pass remember the prophet said whatever you read in the scripture put yourself there right so this scripture that we are reading we are not reading for the Old Testament Believers we are ready for ourselves today Hallelujah and it shall come to pass unto my commandment which I command you this day to love the Lord your God and to serve him with all your heart and with all your soul that I will give you the reign of your land in his due season the first rain and the latter rain the thou Mayors Gather in thy corn and thine wine and thy oil and I will send grass in thy fields for thy cuttle that thou mayest eat and be full you see God has already prepared all this for his people the only thing God wants is that his children will come his way oh my God and I will send grass in thy field for thy cattle that thou mayest eat and be full oh thank you God we won't always to be full take heed to yourself that your heart be not deceived and yet turn aside and serve other gods and worship them and then the Lord's route be Kindle against you and he shut up the heaven that there will be no rain and that the land yield not her fruit unless you perish quickly from all the good land which the lord giveth you therefore shall ye lay up this my words in your hearts let me repeat that please therefore shall ye lay up this way this my words in your heart and in your soul and bind them for a sign upon your hand that there may be as frontless between your eyes and yes I teach them your children speaking of them when thou seated in their house and when thou workers by the way when thou lies down and when doubt Rises up meaning in every situation in every condition we must make sure that we are meditating upon God's word and for that matter we teach our children oh thank God that we understand those truths Day by Day and Night by night we are teaching our children he said when we sit we should speak about that he said when we walk by the way we should speak about that he said when we sleep we should speak about that when we rise we should speak about that meaning at all times we should speak about the word of God he said let us meditate upon it shall write them upon the doorpost of thy house and upon thy Gates that your days may be multiplied and the days of your children in the land which the Lord swear unto your fathers to give them are the days of Heaven upon the Earth for if you shall diligently keep all these Commandments which I command you to do them to love the Lord your God to walk in all his ways and to claim unto him then will the Lord drive out all these nations from before you and yesha possess greater Nations and mightier than yourselves amen every place where on the soul of your future tread shall be yours from the Wilderness and Lebanon from the river the river uffrage is even onto the ottoman sea shall your Coast be there shall no man be able to stand before you for the Lord your God shall lay the fear of you and the dread of you upon all the land that yea shall tread upon as he has said unto you oh my goodness if the situation is like this then I think we have a great weapon we have a great weapon to defeat any opposition that rises in our way because the fight does not belong to us the fight belongs to God Hallelujah he said I'll fight for you and you hold your peace so who is the enemy who is disappointed who is frustration and I believe with all my heart that whatever God leads the way and you follow there is no problem there is no disappointment there is no frustrations there is no failure because God is the leader amen Hallelujah Once Upon a Time when it came to the time that Naomi was patterned from Moab because they took a journey oh my goodness it's always better to take the way of the Lord but Naomi and the husband well they said that problem has come to uh Bethlehem for that matter they have to live to Moab leaving the god of Israel among the Israelites and going to a place where Idols are worshiped think about that and when they went great Calamity fell upon them okay let me put it this way great Calamity fall upon the woman the husband died the two sons that's supposed to have you know console her also perished it was left with this woman alone but when I tell God that the woman realized that no after all she has lost everything that she came with so therefore let me go back to my country and it is always good to turn around when you see that the going is not favoring you just turn around when you realize that you are not going God's way just turn around and come back to God's way [Music] because God's way is the only way that can help all of us so the woman realized no let me turn around and go God's way so one day according to the Bible this to you know uh he loss root and upper and told them that look women I came here four but I'm not empty but I want to take my emptiness back home so therefore go back to your people I am going back to Bethlehem I'm going back to Israel because after that's where I belong and the Bible says that these two women oppa and Ruth all agree but you see rude was looking on one way an opera was looking another way the prophet said that Opera represents the denomination and wrote represent the bride and there is always this thing that the bride will always have the mind of Christ amen so Ruth look at it now these are two ways should I go back to my people to worship kamash or I shall follow Naomi there were two ways Hallelujah because there was nothing in her there was no Revelation in her there was nothing like the seed of God in here she reached and kissed a woman and bit her farewell okay God be with you amen after all she has had Jehovah being preached so he said God be with you and she left back for her Idols yes but Ruth mine look at the woman's face Naomi he said madam and treat me not to return amen for where you go I will go the way that you have chosen I know that that is the way of God so therefore don't tell me to return for your God shall be my God your people shall be my people Hallelujah amen meaning she was ready to worship Jehovah he said your goal shall be my God your people shall be mine people a gentle woman proclaiming this oh brother she did that by inspiration amen she did that by Revelation she was taking God's way she was ready to pay God's way because she knew that that is where she will come into the terms of the god of Israel he said where you sleep there I will sleep why there I will die and while you are buried there I'll be buried what made Ruth to talk about all this talking about that talking about Resurrection because the mind of Christ has been placed in that woman already so she was talking about death amen he said when Naomi will be buried there should be buried she knew Hallelujah that when Abraham died he was buried at a particular place when Sarah died Abraham bought machipella and buried the wife Sarah and all their patrons were buried there Hallelujah so now Ruth caught the Revelation that there is going to be something happening over there and that would be the resurrection so she wanted to be buried when Naomi will be buried oh praise be the name of our God Amen amen and today we thank God that Jesus Christ is how muchipella Hallelujah and all of us have been buried in him Hallelujah your baptism signifies your death and when you were brought from under the water signifies your Resurrection so that is what we have done that is our experience and we have taken the way of the Lord oh brother sister can you imagine that this woman took the way of God she went to bedland empty there was no hope but yet because she was on the way of the Lord God himself Made A Way where there was no way amen one day she got up and Naomi said that my daughter we don't have anything to eat why don't you go to the field and see whether you can you know go follow those Harvesters and then see if you can get something to knock home so that we can you know share Ruth said Mom I would go and she got herself up and went to the field but look at what God did Ruth didn't know that there was anybody called Boaz but God directed her way and he went to the field of Boaz do you know why because she already took God's way and when you tell God's way today all the days of the old days all the days of your life God will lead you amen God will lead you so God LED Ruth and found herself on the field of Boaz the Reapers were reaping and she was just following trying to gather you know the leftovers it was not quite long when Boaz came around and when boss came around and he saw Ruth then he asked his workers hey who is that woman they said well that is the woman that Naomi brought from Moab I said hey take good care of that woman treat her very well make sure that you Harvesters because of this woman deliber briefly live some of the food behind you what was that that the grace of God will intentionally make a way to bless you but what are you like the blessing or not he will bless you because it tastes his will it's his desire to stand by his weight it's a god a way that I have given you and you see your blessings upon your way yes he said meditate upon the word day and night not someday not sometime but all the time that is why I don't believe in Christians who come to church today and uh 2000 years they will not come again the third thousand year they will come to church I don't believe in that Christianity brother sister let us be firm and and free that doesn't help our Christian Journey we must be able to find ourselves always or you say brother is my work yes I know sometimes it's your work but sometimes it is not your work sometimes it's your laziness yes Hallelujah so I say sometimes it's not your work sometimes you share laziness but the Holy Ghost don't produce laziness the Holy Ghost always produce vibrancy people that can stand on your feet yes and respond to their names that is what the Holy Ghost want us to be Hallelujah you think if Ruth stayed at home will he have received that blessing no root wasn't a lazy woman but because of the way that she took but what said this woman I want you to live in fact deliberate leave the food behind you so that she will pick them oh brother I see God I see God living certain things on your way I see God deliberately living your blessings and you are coming to carry them I see God raising you up oh Lord from your things that has brought you down God is Raising you up mine and Ruth guarded all that another time she went back this time Boaz richer you say woman anytime you come and drink come and drink from my band I have a cooler that the water is so cold don't go to that you know Muddy Waters come and drink here it was God's favor for Ruth because she took God's way can you say Amen here hallelujah she took God's way and you know that day he said woman open your sack and he himself measured six measures of Bali and put in a sack of Ruth amen he said go and feed on that when it's finished come back Hallelujah and you ask yourself why six because we believe that normal sex is the number of a man Hallelujah but do you know the number seven is also always a mystery the number seven is always always a mystery after Boaz gave six measures of belly to Ruth the seventh one was on the way and the seventh one was Boaz himself amen hallelujah that someone was born you know the story already when Naomi told Ruth that hey boss is going to um we know you know his Harvest and there will be going to be a party prepare yourself and go but this is the trick or for that matter this is the way of God after the man has made himself merry watch him watch him wherever you lay ah go and lay at his feet and perhaps when you got up and asked you who is this tell him straight to his face you are the kingsman cover me with your skate and Ruth did exactly so Hallelujah that day oh brother but what was so shocked to find a woman you know Israelis are very careful of whatever they do he didn't want anybody to accuse him he didn't want anybody to think that he was a very bad man so when he saw root by his he said who is who are you he said I'm Ruth you are the king's man come on me with your skirt it was imparable yes but like the prophet said when they deep collect onto the Deep there must be a dip to respond so when Ruth made that statement but was understood and said well there is a Kingsman that is closer than myself I would deal with him if he will do what he's supposed to do but if he will not then I will take over to cut their story short the woman the man refused and then the Redeemer ship fell upon Boaz and Boaz has to marry Ruth oh praise be the name of our God and that was the blessing and the joy of the army again because every blessing That Came Upon Ruth it affected Naomi beloved take God's way amen amen and when you take God's way God will surely stand by you amen and amen Hallelujah he told Joshua he says this book of the law shall not depart that's verse 8 shall not Depart of the out of thy mouth but thou shall meditate therein day and night that thou mayest observe to do according to all that is written therein for them Thou shalt make thy way prosperous and then thou shall have good sources not just sources but good one amen you see good sources my oh I'm blessed oh yes I'm blessed oh I'm blessed how are you blessed I am successful I am successful how are you successful can you be successful without the Lord Jesus Christ can you be blessed without the Lord Jesus Christ so he said I'll give you good sources amen you are blessed and you have the Lord Jesus Christ also in your life oh what is more than this brother Hallelujah two ways tell God's way like you told the Israel I said today I've said before you two ways the good and the evil but I God I am telling you to take the good one that's right because when you take the good one I will bless you I'll multiply you I will make you great and you will subdue all your enemies amen now all mine let's listen to this type of prophet said he said I'm talking I'm taking this from talk on the word he says full steps is Victory he told Joshua everywhere the food or your soul the foot will trod I will give it to you and I'll tell you today brother sister let's throw it on the lands that God give to us okay Divine Healing powers of God everything coming into Christ is like going down to the big arcade down here maybe Walmart or any big shop that you can talk about going into a variety store just think in a variety store the size like this Tabernacle perhaps this is a small place for Walmart as compared to Walmart we can have about 100 100 uh send the light Auditorium in Walmart very huge and what is the prophet trying to imply here he says when you enter into that shop there are varieties there are things so many things and you go in for a purpose you need something that is why you go there you want to buy something you want to own something right so you go and grab it and then you go and pay it don't make you pay it belongs to you yeah yeah that is why you are given receipt when you pay but on our case the price is already paid Jesus have already paid we don't pay anything again but we go there and take what belongs to us whatever our needs are we go there and take it because we are going by his way oh Hallelujah I look around there is everything in here the shelves are all full of nice pretty things and everything that that I like they are all mine they belong to me every one of them belongs to me I can go over and take what I want oh yes yes yes yes yes yes I can go into Jesus Christ and take whatever I want nobody can question me Hallelujah because everything that is in Christ belongs to us amen everything not some things everything that is in Christ belong to us it depends upon you whether you want to take it or not Hallelujah there are certain things that is in your life you need courage to take it there are certain things in your life you need Faith to take it amen hallelujah look at the Centurion when his his daughter or whatever was was was was sick and he reached to Jesus he knew that there is something in Jesus Christ that he can take it he said master when you come please and pray for my my servant when Christ made attempt to go he said no no no I am not even worthy for you to come under my roof I am a captain of the army I have servants under me I said to this go and you go with I said to this come and they come so don't come to my house just pick the word Oh my Jesus look at the man so what a faith what a faith the man knew that something is Jesus Christ and you need to take it and you took it at that time the seven got healed because Jesus said Let It Be according to your faith we can talk about the woman with a blood issue when all over the place he has been to one hospital to another and there was no cure for her she has heard Jesus Christ performing and she knew that indeed if Christ has performed in the life of other people then of course he can also perform in his life amen that is the challenge of every child of God if God has done it for me he will do it for you also if you have done it for you he can do it for me also the only thing I have to do is to make sure that I am on his way not my way not my choice but the choice of God Hallelujah the woman said well the people are many around this man but if I can Touch the Hem of His government that's right I think that would be enough for me he didn't even request that Jesus prayed for him for her he said I will touch only the Hem of the Garment and the woman was able to crawl between the people I don't know how their legs were open anyway but she was able to crawl and touch the hand of the Garment of Jesus Christ and for the first time Jesus said Peter somebody have touched me oh Christ was that the first time somebody's touching you the answer was no Peter said Lord many people have touched you by the way before we even Gotti so so why this statement he said Peter I know that many people have touched me but all those touches were ordinary touches this particular touch is a touch of faith this particular touch was a touch of demand this particular Touch Somebody knew that he has something in me so he or she is coming for it because virtue has gone out of me oh we can imagine the faith of that woman the woman that nobody respects respect the woman that has been with infirmity for 12 good years oh brother there is something in God there is something in Jesus Christ for you go get it I said go get it Go Daddy don't let us talk amen Jesus said that you have gone out of me and then when they were looking around then the woman owned up say Lord I did touch you and this is the reason he said look at the woman he's a woman you're fake has made you whole Jesus didn't say by my power he said your faith that's right has made you whole okay the faith the faith that you use in touching me brother I said today it's not like we are going into Walmart to go and take things but now it's in Jesus Christ and everything has been paid already amen let's go take our possessions Hallelujah and Christ is on the right store by one Spirit we are all baptized into one big variety storm anything you have need of he will supply it if I need healing I will take it if I need Joy I will take it right if I need Victory I will take it it's all hanging around in God's big Variety Store and I'm Poss and I am possession and you have possession of everything in that Variety Store when you are baptized with the Holy Ghost yes and the prophet said amen brother you talk about Elbow Room let's take over we need healing there is something there for you just reach over and get it oh Hallelujah you're mad you might have you you might have to kick over few things huh you might have to kick over a few things here to get it push through a few things to get to it but go ahead and take it yes you might have to get a ladder and reach up for it Hallelujah but God has got a letter there amen if you are interested you see there is a condition if you are interested amen he said there are healings there are blessings there are Joy there are everything in that shop for us you might have to kick certain things after when you go to Walmart it's not everything that you want do you want anything everything oh which car can carry the things that's the worst in in Walmart it can be possible you have particular things that you need at the time right and the prophet is saying that you might be able to kick certain things out you walk over things and go get what you need Hallelujah you you jump this you go this you you jump that and then you grab you go to there are even there are shelves there are sharks they packed some of the things over there and say you might need a ladder to climb but I thank God Amen amen that in Jesus Christ we have a ladder that we climb and take something on the shelves amen you asked me brother Daniel who what is that where is that ladder that ladder is Jesus Christ you climb by Jesus Christ and you go up and take what belongs to you amen you take what belongs to you nobody can take your blessings from your hand anything Christ have prepared for you nobody can pick it from your hands don't let it be idle amen take it and use it take it and make good use of it for it belongs to you only walk by God's way amen can you imagine that the Lord will look down upon us and he knew that he has already done everything for us even on the cross he said it is finished and he will sit down and look at his children that we are not able to claim what belongs to us we are not able to take what belongs to us oh we are crawling sometimes or is because of our attitude our attitude sometimes a retards our progress the way we we handle Christ the way we behave as Christians sometimes it blocks our progress it doesn't make us to be an energetic you know to go for what we need to go for sometimes our thinking Hallelujah that is why Paul said let the mind of Christ be in US and if the mind of Christ in US brother we can pick anything that belongs to us amen he said push through a few things to go get to it but go ahead and take it you might have to get a ladder and reach up for it but God has got a letter there if you are interested in getting it amen and the prophet said give me oil in my lamb keep me burning give me oil in my life I pray give me oil in my life give me burning burning Banning keep me burning oh Hallelujah and even when when the when the oil is in you and your lump is being bent oh brother you cannot walk in darkness because you have your long burning all around you why because Jesus Christ is not alive in you all beloved brothers and sisters the prophet said that if we know what God has made us to be oh man we'll do exploit but sometimes we ourselves as Christians inventing here we don't know who we are true well people may see us to be ordinary but we are not ordinary like that right right we have the whole Heavens always around us because we are walking on God's way he said that if you walk by my way there is nothing that can be able to stand before you asked brother Ferguson was giving his testimony you may take it to be light but it was God's protection but God allowed that to happen for you to know that there was a trap the impact wouldn't be so much but don't think that way the impact became less because Christ stopped that thing yes but he allowed the what do you call the crash for you to know that Satan set a trap my pastor in the Pentecostal realm in those days give us a testimony about a Chinese who was working and I think there was something that fell on one of his finger and it cut deep blood was oozing and the man held that finger and said oh thank you Jesus thank you Jesus thank you Jesus and the workers you have you have such an accident and you are thanking Jesus what is wrong with you then the man said the devil had want had wanted to cut my finger completely off but Christ same the situation Hallelujah so I only have a little cut even though I'm in pain but I thank God that my finger is so intact Hallelujah because he was walking Christ's way amen no this brother and his children had the accident God removed the impact had he not been there who wouldn't know what would have happened he is always with us he is always with us you see I'm saying that let us have the mind of Christ that we are not alone in our homes at our workplaces in the schools on the streets he is always with us you always want to work with us like how he worked with cleopas and his friend and they didn't know that he was working with them oh Hallelujah they didn't know about you and I we must know Christ is with us look at the testimony I gave to you last Wednesday it was life testimony it was not an imagination something that will happen so if the sister Dorcas was not walking the way of God do you think that the angels will come and rescue him because she was working on God's will when she was kidnapped by three men four say driver let me get down the driver said no you just boarded the car why do you want to get down he said no I've forgotten something at home I have to go and get it the driver said no I'm not stopping so while they were going all of a sudden by the roadside there there were three men standing there one of them stopped the car and he said driver I have heard the voice of this woman from far that she wants to get down why are you not trying to stop for her to get down so at this juncture sister Dorcas got the chance to open the door and came out and she banged the door only to 10 and said thank you to the men and nobody was behind her [Music] she walked God way if you walk God way brother I don't care whatever you are God will be with you sister God will be with you because he has promised in his word and when he came to tell me I said sister go and tell the church what God has done for you but it reminded me straight away when Abraham and Sarah were in their home and three men also came around oh my it was only one man among the three that spoke it has always been like that Jesus will always speak to our lives Hallelujah anything that he has for us why he will not deprive us of them it's our duty to go his way and take what belongs to us that's right amen let me let me read few things so that now he says now well now God just didn't go over there is the challenge and take a broom and sweep out the Canaanites and all the amorites and he tights and all of them and sweep sweep them out and say Come O Israel come my people this is yours even planted the cross for you no no no no no no sir God didn't do that they had to fight every inch of the way that is right yes that's why sometimes people say Christianity is hard no it's not hard you only have the mind of Christ and follow the principle of the Bible refuse the things of the world overcome the trust and temptation of the world what the word loves so much to overcome it coming and the moment you do that you'll be able Hallelujah he said they have to fight every inch of the way that is right but they hurt the promise of Victory God told Joshua whatever The Souls of your feet tread that I have given you so Footprints meant possession remember that sister Hallelujah remember that brother your Footprints means your possession every time the soul of your feet touch that is it take that much ground Hallelujah no wonder either an animal like the mama opposium can even have the mind with the wounds all over it and crawl on a highway and go and lay at the door of the Prophet right can you imagine this even if God can use this creature to go to the man of God for prayer how much more you and I amen who God have given part of his himself how much more the prophet met the Apostle he said hey what are you doing here why don't you go to the bush I'm a right man to kill right now and make good use of you and the prophet entered into his room picked certain things and came back the opposal was still there and when you look around it was full of wounds then all of a sudden the Spirit came down to the prophet say no something is happening and I've not realized that this creature is here for prayer that's right so he removed his heart and knelt laid his hand upon the creature and prayed a simple prayer Lord if this is the reason why this opposom is here granted the healing immediately immediately all the wounds vanish from the creature and this of them climb the ladder and went to the shelves and pick what belonged to it and when it was healed you know what he did Bow Down a head before the prophet it went back again did the same thing it went back again the third time then you know this creature was thanking God for the healing this creature was recognizing that God indeed worked in mysterious ways and if it happened to an opposal how much more you who have been baptized no purchased by the blood of Jesus Christ and you have been baptized he said he knew you before the foundation of the world Amen so all our ways are already prepared by God beloved let us go God's way the world has nothing to offer don't let us lean on our own understanding let us always come into the terms of the word the message of this hour has opened the Bible to us let us follow the cause of God brother my sister there's no disappointment in the Lord Jesus Christ there is no failure in Jesus Christ amen there is no hindrance there's no obstacles in the Lord Jesus Christ is always blessing Joy progress sources that is it no matter what we go through that is what the prophet said let's kick certain things out yes you understand that statement anything that will try to stand on your way kick it out in frustration want to stand your way kick it out if disappointment want to stand away kick it out Hallelujah and let us go take what belongs to us that's why I love this song I want God's way to be my way acai Jenny here below for there's no other Highway that a child of God should go for the rose we have forgotten a song if he leads me is enough I want God's way to be my way every day every day in my life I want God's way to be my way everywhere in your life you have to allow God's way to be your way for there's no other way that can bring you sources there's no other way that can bring you Joy there is no other way that can bring you freedom only the way of the Lord Jesus Christ Hallelujah beloved brothers and sisters in order not to keep you so much longer let me read my last quote okay and then we'll call it he says God's word is a seed God is in his word look at him when he makes his word manifest his promises or what he will do look at a hundred and twenty people taking God's word um they went up to the day of Pentacles and waited until that Commission he said tarrier in the city of Jerusalem until you are endured with power from on high God's word sunk into their hearts and they waited they waited hmm what was or what were they doing just sitting around saying well I'll see what will happen hmm you can't water it that way that's what the prophet said you can't water it that way oh well the promise is there but well I'll fold my hands let me sit down and see what will happen no right you don't progress by that you don't progress by that right huh anything even when you come to the Physical Realm those Athletics those who go on Sports they always do exercise the train because they want they are what do we call it they want to get more uh oh there's a term ah there's a term that they use they want to get more stamina so they can stand and as Christians we don't sit down and fold our hands and think that things are going to draw from the sky for us to pick them on the ground in those days that God brought the manner Hallelujah even the manner felt quite all right but the manner didn't go into their homes they went on their field to gather them are you catching it so the prophet said that you don't water it that way that oh I have the promise of God I fold my hands and I said no you must be in action what happened he said you don't water it that way if you say well yes I believe in Divine Healing oh sure it is in the Bible yes it's in the Bible that is not the way to get healed you might have the seed but you got to water it you got to water it brother water your face sister what are your faith and let's go get what belongs to us in Jesus Christ [Music] he said when they were in the upper room they were blessing and thanking and praising God why praising him because they knew it was coming amen for they had the seed in their hearts God's promise hmm many times you see Believers so happy beautiful face nice face because everything is going on well [Laughter] but when they begin to face challenges oh sometimes they don't even want to come to church but staying from church that does solve your problem no becoming present yourself so miserable oh I don't have food I don't have anything to eat today oh Lord what am I going to do and you sit down will God bring you food no that is why in all things we must rejoice we must Rejoice look let us show to the devil that we are stubborn to him under no circumstance we allow the devil to make us sad no that of us we have to clean things out let anything any hindrance obstacles that the devil tried to put on you take it out by your faith walk as if nothing has happened worship God as if nothing has happened praise God as if nothing has happened and that was what they were doing in the upper room according to the court of the Prophet amen even though the Pharisees and the services were looking all over the place to arrest them and perhaps kill them but they were not quiet they gathered at the upper room and they were praising God they were worshiping God and the prophet said that you know why he said because they knew that their promise was coming everything in Christ belongs to us praise God let us continue worship god with a bad child let us be bold and proud Amen Let Us open our mouth and tell about the gospel let us continue to send the light and God will bless us it belongs to us God bless all of us let's party precious Lord Jesus this moment also we thank you we give you the glory Lord we give you the an adoration many many
