just take your Bibles we'll be reading from Ephesians chapter 4 and like to bring greetings to you from Arizona Believers Church is it is it off on it's not on be careful it is now okay good bring greetings to you from Arizona Believers Church I just thought of it this morning this past week was the four-year anniversary of us starting that church uh in permanent Services mooved there on the 3 I think our first service is around the 5ifth can't remember exact dates but uh it's uh been growing the right way and we appreciate the grace of God that we've seen in doing so and so greetings to you uh from the Believers there and uh everyone hope that you all could get a chance to come visit and we've been working on brother John and sister Cheryl finally we just told Brother John if if Mom doesn't want to come you just come so but eventually hopefully we can get them out there to visit again and we're glad that we could come this time we are in the process of moving into our own home and there was just a little bit of a delay it was going to be in August and it's moved a little bit and when we had that little bit extra time we thought let's just go to Michigan for his many days as we possibly can and so just so grateful that we had uh the chance to come even though it's a short trip we're glad that we could be here I always let everyone know it's not a vacation for me because I work and uh yesterday I was talking to Brother John we had some time just to kind of hang out a little bit and I mentioned that I'd like to help him do some things maybe around the shop there around the garage and he said no when you come here you don't need to work and I'm like what do you think I'd do for a living and so uh um I said well sometimes it's that physical labor that I actually enjoy uh more than just the ministry and we still do work in the practice of law but that's become less and less and we're grateful for that that the Lord has freed us up to be able just to focus on Ministry but we love you we love you all very very much brother John your dear friend your dear example and so we appreciate the privilege you give us today to minister Ephesians chapter 4 we'll start with verse 7 we'll read to verse 16 you weren't here Wednesday night you won't be too far behind uh but we so we will just give a few things just to recap the foundation that we ministered on Wednesday night but our title is God is not a grandpa but unto every one of us is given Grace according to the measure of the gift of Christ wherefore he saith when he ascended up on high he led captivity captive and gave gifts unto men now that he ascended what is it but that he also descended first into the lower parts of the earth he that descended is the same also that ascended up far above all heavens that he might fill all things and he gave some Apostles and some prophets and some evangelists and some pastors and teachers for the perfecting of the Saints for the work of the ministry for the edifying of the body of Christ till we all come in the unity of the faith and of the knowledge of the Son of God unto a perfect man unto the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ that we henceforth be no more children tossed to and fro and carried about with every wind of Doctrine by the slight of men and cunny crafted whereby they lie and wait to deceive but speaking the truth in love may grow up into him in all things which is the head even Christ from whom the whole body is fitly joined together and compacted by that which every joint supplieth according to the effectual working in the measure of every part maketh increase of the body un the edifying of itself in love wow what poetry if we could just bow our heads in prayer gracious heavenly father today Lord as we have this opportunity to be together we're grateful for it thank you Lord we believe that you're already here in our midst because you promised to be where two or three are gathered in your name there you'll be Lord we believe that you're amongst us because we've lifted up praises to you and you inhabit the Praises of your people and Lord as all have come here that you knew would be here as we sit in your divine presence we ask now that you'd speak to our hearts and Lord if there be those unfamiliar with me or my Ministry Lord may they just realize that it's the word that should have preeminence it's not the man it's but the matter which has spoken so Lord help me to stay focused on the word Lord that the Bible would become alive To Us by Revelation help all of us father just to lay aside bias and any uncomfortable feelings that we might have and just expect you to speak to us as we have need of you we ask this in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen you can be seated I've mentioned already that our title is God is not a grandpa and Wednesday night we'll just give a quick summary of where we were Wednesday night and sister an I don't know if you have that slide uh from Wednesday night maybe just show it real quick that opening slide we used but it was an article written um way back in the 60s in the Full Gospel businessman's voice and uh David deissy wrote an article and he said God has no grandsons and he told the story of uh how that the Lord just kind of spoke that and it was ringing in his ears and it just impressed him and he wrote an article in which he said and did you have the slide of the article there it is and I know it's written quite some time ago but yet we know that uh brother brandham quoted it many many times God has no Pentecostal children God has no grandchildren but this thought is really profound it's God not having any grandchildren and as we looked at it Wednesday night we felt like if there's some sort of emphasis there's something there in it there's a reason for it and we found that the chief reason that God has no Grant Sons is you must be born again that God only has Sons and Daughters he does not have grandsons he does not have cousins he's never been an uncle and God has no grandsons or granddaughters he only has sons and daughters so that means that all all God's seed are born direct from him when we look at it in the natural we see that people can be related and we can do DNA test and you could find that you're related to this person you're related to that person they could see a genealogy and say oh this person is a grandchild of this individual I've often joked that I wanted to hand out DNA tests to my extended family on Christmas just to see who might be the serial killer when they start getting all nervous like are we really doing this we don't have to do this uh but there is a way that they can do this in the natural but when it comes to the spiritual Gene if you did a DNA test everyone's a direct descendant God is the father there's no well you're distantly related to God and so we conclude from that God is not a Grandpa regardless of the new birth experience that your parents may have had you must be born again also and what was at the real heart of of that emphasis was seen in the scripture in many different places that God is not a man God is not a man that he would lie and let the words of man be a lie but let God's word be a truth be the truth God is not man where he repents like man and he does things like man does so God not being a man he cannot have grandchildren and this was to me the the kicker nor does he want them and to grandparents might be hard to get their head around the fact that God would not want to have grandchildren but that was uh one thing we wanted to emphasize is God is not a grandpa and he doesn't he's not missing anything in his mind because he doesn't even want to have grandchildren and so I want to uh take a step forward in this and give some reasons are just uh build upon that foundation and something that might hopefully will make uh sense to us spiritually but the nature and responsibility of a grandparent is different than that of parents and I think that may be obvious and we're talking about the general rule not the role that sometimes grandparents F feel when uh something happens to parents or parents need the help and grandparents will step in and and be the primary caretaker and sometimes grandparents will raise their grandchildren as the parents so they can assume that role but we're acknowledging the fact that it's not the grandparents responsibility it's something extra that they take on it's something they have to step into and just to kind of wet our whistle a little bit on what I mean by that I have a few statements out of many that we could find about Grandparents I think I mentioned these maybe at the very end Wednesday but grandchildren are the reward you get for keeping their parents alive and I guess it implies maybe if you don't strangle them when they're kids if they are able to grow up a and have children that the grandchildren are the reward for you not killing them and uh or they say the opposite that grand grandchildren are the reward for surviving your children that if they haven't killed you that grandchildren are the reward for doing that and then the there statement is made I think this was written in a book being a grandparent sufficiently removes us from the responsibilities so that we can be friends and it implies that a a parent has a special responsibility and a special relationship to their child to uh raise them and to discipline and that grandparents are maybe not completely removed but they're sufficiently enough removed to where they don't have to worry about that or have the primary burden responsibility of it so they can just be friends with the grandchildren and I think that's a beautiful part and all the grandparents say amen amen and then to me this is the one that really serves my purpose so it may be selfish if I pick this one out to end on but it says when grandparents enter the door discipline flies out the window and it was in this that I learned why God has no grandchildren because and I watched how my dad treated my kids I was like well no wonder there's there's no uh respect for what the parents want yeah give them coffee let them chew candy at 2 o'clock in the morning it was kind of like wanting to be the cool Grandpa may he wasn't that bad but it was then that I realized that the the grandpa can just come and go he can yo-yo you know can be around for the fun stage and when things get difficult hey I'm out of here we'll see you later and so it is true that they my I think my grand my my kids grandparents in Texas even had a sign that once you cross this threshold there's no more rules does anybody remember what it said no but you remember the sign it was a sign that basically said grandkids are just free to do whatever they want once they enter into this house and so that kind of helps us understand this distinct relationship between a grandparent to a grandchild and how different it is from that of a parent and these statements reflect the difference in Dynamics whereas a parent a par has a burden and it has a they have a great responsibility whereas the grandparent Dynamic is free from that grandparents do not have the primary responsibility of raising the children and instructing them and and maybe more importantly correcting and disciplining and it's not that they don't have a role in that they just don't have the primary responsibility and burden a grandparent isn't fashioning the vision the grandparent isn't the one taking the lead but a grandparent should catch the vision of the parents and support them in that even if they have one different and say well I wouldn't raise them that way but I want to respect the way that you're doing and I want to support you and I want to reinforce that and I could say that uh brother John and sister Cheryl have been amazing in that there's been times in our children being raised where we've uh benefited from uh brother John and sister Shell catching the vision and seeing what we're trying to do and reinforcing that and taking an active role and encouraging them so this isn't me taking a shot at my in-laws today it really is just uh me a point about the difference in grandparents and I think you can all I I'm not a grandparent so I'm a I'm a great dad I hope but I'm not a grandparent but grandparents can enjoy the fun of the grandchildren they can have the fellowship they can have the Friendship they can Frolic and play and that can be all that they do in other words they they can enjoy the Frolic they can enjoy the play they can enjoy all the things that come with uh being a grandparent because in Proverbs chap 22:6 it says train up a child in the way that he should go and when he is old he will not depart from it that responsibility isn't the primary role of the grandparent that's the role and responsibility of the parents the ones that birth him the one that have the ones that have the more instinc of love and that and that drive to do so and that being said I think a lot of parents can relate to this I've heard it said many times but many parents often love a certain stage of childhood and as they either hold their baby or they they're in that a certain stage they say I want them to always stay like this anybody ever said that I hope they never grow up I love this size and I wish they would just stay at this stage and it might be that stage where they're not able to talk back it might be at that stage where you're just able to tell them what they want to do and they can't give you any opinions or they're completely dependent upon you and you feed them and you change their diapers and you pick their clothes out and and there's those that just love certain stages of that CH of childhood that stage of fun and enjoyment and uh that stage where you can just enjoy the personality uh before the real work of correcting and disciplin and instructing begins maybe it's that stage when you can just rely on well because Dad said so and there might be just certain stages can you relate with that there's people who say I hope they never I wouldn't I don't want them to grow up I want them to stay this size exactly and it might have something to do with the fact for the first two years you're trying to get them to talk and walk and the rest of their lives to sit and be quiet but the truth is there's stages where we really really love kids at a certain stage and we don't want them to grow up but God is not a man no he doesn't want grandchildren he wants to have children amen and God is not a man so he doesn't want them to stay children it's his desire that they grow up and so that's where that's at the heart of this thought God is not a grandpa as we looked at it Wednesday night you must be born again and this word birth brings you forth as a babe in Christ in 1 Timothy chapter 1 verse 23 he says being born again this speaks of the believer not of corruptible seed but of Incorruptible seed by the word of God which liveth and abideth forever that is what every CH child of God is is born of The Incorruptible seed of the word of God and it is a seed that liveth and abideth forever so be born again and this is what caught Nicodemus off guard he says be born again how can a man who when he is old enter back into the womb of his mother and be born again because it does set forth the truth of infancy of being a newborn and being a babe and so being born again we begin in type as a babe or an infant in the body of Christ and that's spiritually as you are when you're born again you are spiritually a babe in Christ even Jesus himself in Luke 2: 11 and 12 did not come forth as a full grown mature man whereas Adam did Christ the second Adam comes forth a as a baby as it says as he speaks these angels speak to Shepherds for unto you is Born This Day in the city of David a savior which is Christ the lord so he had been born of a woman the prophecy spoke of him coming forth born of a woman and this shall be a sign unto you you shall find the Babe wrapped in swaddling clothes lying in a m manger this is how the Prince of Peace came forth this is how the mighty conqueror came forth this is how uh the the go the one upon whom the government would rest upon his shoulder he came forth as a babe wrapped in swaddling clothes lying in a manger and so just as Jesus Christ came forth as a babe you spiritually when you were born again come forth as a babe in Christ amen Jesus even makes this statement in Luke 10: 211 he says in that Jesus rejoiced in spirit and said I thank thee oh Father Lord of Heaven and Earth that thou Hast hid these things from the wise and prudent he's he's pointing out those who have lived it all seen it all heard it all know it all and and they have an answer to every question and you can't teach them anything so the wise and PR are the learn they've already learned they're now the teachers and so they they you can't reveal something to them because they they just have too much in their database where they're figuring everything out and they're going to tell you exactly what it is actually but he says and Hast revealed them unto babes amen even so father for so it seemed good in thy sight it's been revealed unto babes and the thought that is expressed in this scripture is you have the wise and prudent the learn the educated the grownup the mature but he reveals them unto babes who are able to learn amen such as our as such as are able to read and to uh they can learn they can grow from that state of being a babe one thing I don't mean to get lost in this but I find it fascinating but a baby's brain has tremendous neuroplasticity and I know you all know what that is so I won't tell you what it is but it's the ability to change and adapt after having new experiences right and so as a baby's brain has this neuroplasticity uh they say that in a baby it's always on it's always activated so they're wired to try something over and over and over again to master a skill like frustrating you they just they'll try something over and over again they don't ever give up whereas I guess if we as adults if we had to learn to walk again we might just like forget about it they make really good wheelchairs but for children they try and they try and they try and they'll try something over and over again until they Master a skill and this learning process that this as a babe creates these neural Pathways where they make this connection and in doing so that makes them more proficient and it opens up their brain to grow and to be used a little bit more I say grow just those neural Pathways and how it's exercised and this process is most constant within the first 5 years of a child's life and during this time they can quickly uh unlearn negative habits and replace them with good ones and things that are better and so this is a real critical stage in a in the development of a person is when they are a babe when they're an infant when they're a toddler because they're learning things and they can try and they can quickly unlearn bad things at a young age so Jesus says he revealed them unto babes such as would learn such as are able to be taught and to grow and of Jesus it was said in Luke 2:52 Jesus at the age of 12 goes home to be with his parents it says he submitted himself unto the parents and increased in wisdom in stature and in favor with God and man God entrusted his own son to Parenthood he didn't bring him forth as an orphan and and and was adopted and raised by grandparents or uncles and it wasn't Elizabeth that or Zachariah but it was uh John and Mary Joseph and Mary raised Jesus in WIS uh to increase in wisdom and stature and in favor with God and man and Jesus was subject unto his parents and grew so in 1 Peter chapter 2 veres 1 2 and 3 Peter says this to the believer as he said prior the prior chapter we're Born Again by The Incorruptible seed of the word of God which liveth and abideth forever so having been born again and and with our spiritual neuroplasticity where we're able to learn things and and by Revelation increase these neural Pathways and and unlearn bad habits and keep trying and keep pressing he says lay aside all malice and all guile and hypocrisies and envies and all evil speakings this is what he's teaching the born again to do so there's a process of laying down but not just laying down there is a reaching out there's a a grabbing for as newborn babes desire the sincere milk of the word that you may grow thereby if so be that ye have tasted that the Lord is gracious if you've tasted his grace if you've been born again then to lay aside all these negative things lay aside all the things of the flesh a as paully puts it says put off the old man put on the new man and so lay aside all these negative human traits these things related to Fallen Humanity and as a newborn spiritual babe brought forth by the word Gene by the seed of God uh desire the sincere milk of the word and that would be for all of us we say oh well that's true there's a there's a stage at which that is the primary substance by which a child a baby is develops is solely by the milk and that it's desire the sincere milk of the word that you may grow so a babe who's been born again scripturally just even in following the pattern of what Peter is teaching should desire the milk of the word because that's the only way you're going to grow you're not going to grow by G you're not going to grow by hypocrisies and you're not just going to grow by laying down bad habits you've got to form a new one by Desiring the sincere milk of the word and feeding on the Milk of the word that would cause you to grow by the word and it says milk it's things that maybe are easier for you to process and things that you ought to enjoy and when when you're born again and you begin to enjoy the spirit of God uh you don't need to jump into the Book of Revelation and try to figure it out or bring out all the types in Ezekiel but just enjoy the grace of God enjoy the the the The Parables of Christ and and and lean into the things of God as it relates to Grace and salvation and healing and all the things that God would do with forgiveness of sins feed on the Milk of the word amen Paul said it this way in 1 Corinthians CH 13:1 and I think this just forms a beautiful image when I was a child I spake as a child I understood as a child I thought as a child as children we expect uh childlike behavior and you could go into a room and you could see a baby with a marker drawing all over the wall and you wouldn't agree with that behavior but you would almost expect it because that's what a baby would do but if you walked into the church this morning and I was over here with the giant crayon just working on the wall you be like that image is a little in congruent with how old that dude looks and it wouldn't be you wouldn't expect it and Paul's saying the same thing when I was a child I I spake as a child I understood as a child I thought as a child I acted like a child there was childish things I would do it would maybe be understandable if I got jealous because somebody else had a toy it was understandable if I had malice because I was a little jealous of the new sibling but he says when I became a man I put away childish things and so there is a mark of maturity that has more to do with what you put away instead of what age you are amen the season there's a season of life when there's certain things that are expected because of your age but then there comes a time when because of your age you should put things down and it's what you put down that is the mark of maturity I put away childish things I put away childish speaking and childish thinking and childish understanding and I and I grew to I I chose adulthood by the decisions that I made the things I sought out and the and the way that I chose to live my life and Paul is not just giv you the history of his life that when I was a kid I was a child and I did this and I did that and as I grew up I did more manly things he's relating it to us spiritually amen so in the next chapter in verse 20 he says Brethren be not children in understanding don't be simple and innocent and don't be wishy-washy and don't be ignorant uh and and don't be knowledgeable or don't lack knowledge and don't uh lack Proficiency in understanding he say says don't be children in understanding but in Malice be ye children in other words don't don't be easily don't understand malice don't be quick to malice don't he says be innocent of it be inexperienced in it but in understanding be menen so he's he's making this distinction that there's something to be expected about a child even sometimes children or maybe all the time they'll Express certain things and behaviors and there's no real guile behind it they're not really saying I hate you and they know what it means to hate and I hope I never see you again they they haven't really thought through this uh but they're just saying things maybe they've heard other people say and and they make comments and he's saying that don't be uh uh experienced in Malice so be a child when it comes to malice but when it comes to understanding be men TR be spiritually mature have a matured spiritual mind and not just in your thinking and your contemplations but in your acting and I believe the revelation of the word is Jesus said he Reveals His word unto babes it works to mature our thinking to mature our discernment and our processing and our perception to give us an understanding of the way things work I don't think there's a better book in the world to read to understand human behavior than the Bible and as we read the word and it's quickened to us it matures our thinking it corrects our uh inexperience it corrects our judgments and our and our wrong attitudes and therefore it helps us in our acting second Peter chapter 3:18 he says but grow in Grace and in the knowledge of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ this is the admonishment to those that are born again those that have tasted and seen that the Lord is good the ones that have found that the Lord is gracious Peter says grow in Grace amen there is a maturing there is an increasing in the knowledge of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ so to newborn babes who desire the sincere milk of the word they're going to grow and they're going to put away childish things they're going to become more spiritually mature in their understanding and as they grow in Grace they're to grow in the knowledge of Jesus Christ this is the pattern that God has set forth for his babes it's not necessarily the burden in the pattern that a natural grandparent would have or even some parents would have for their own children where it's like I just wish they would stay this way forever that's not the way that God feels amen Galatians CH 4: 19 Paul says my little children of whom I travail in birth again so he kind of gives him the the heart of a father that you are i' I've brought you forth uh by the word of God and I'm your father in The Gospel he says my little children I'm travailing as a mother would when giving birth he says I travail again because they've already been born by the word of God but now I'm travailing and and I have this great sorrow as a parent that Christ would be formed in you amen you look in the scripture you'll remember I think we might read read it later on here in a little bit yeah we'll read it here in a little bit Lord will and he's dealing with the subject of adoption or maybe a better way of putting that is maturity he saying I'm laboring to see the fullness of Christ manifested in your person I'm not questioning your salvation I'm not questioning your experience but I'm questioning your ability to go forward I'm questioning whether or not you have a hunger to go forward he says having begun in the spirit are you now made perfect by the flesh he says who has hindered you from going further in the grace of God what's kept you back what's restrained you he said I'm travailing as a parent to see you not just be born again but to see Christ formed in you amen remember John wrote in third his third letter verse four I have no Greater Joy than to hear that my children Walk In Truth again there's this uh role of a parent John who had this burden for those that he had brought to Christ he wanted to see them he had no Greater Joy than to know that his children were walking in truth Paul says uh my little children I I'm travailing laboring to see Christ be formed in you they're showing this is the attitude of a parent and not just a not just a natural parent but the heart of God as a father amen I have no Greater Joy than to hear that my children walk in truth that word walk means to make progress in amen it's not just being close to it associated with it but there's no Greater Joy than to know that your children are making progress in the truth that they're increasing inreasing in understanding that in their increase of understanding and the knowledge of Jesus Christ their exercise of of discernment and wisdom demonstrates that they're they're catching a hold and God is quickening to them the principles of the word of God Amen to walk in the light and watch more unfold so Paul was not just happy to see them start in the faith but he wanted to see them finish amen he wanted to see them make progress my little children I I I know that begun but but I want to see you finish this race in Ephesians chapter 5:1 Paul said it this way be therefore followers of God as dear children what an amazing statement telling them the children uh the the believer the Born Again follow God as dear children why because God is your father and what do children do they emulate they impersonate as a matter of fact I challenge anybody with young kids the next time you go to correct your child just stop for moment look at them and wonder and see whether or not you see yourself well I think I taught my kid that I think they're doing that because I do that and there there's nothing like a a example and demonstration to teach more than just what you say and so it's in that principle says be ye therefore catch that phrase be ye therefore followers of God as dear children this is the relationship that Paul's wanting to establish that we may grow into the image of God grow into the image of Christ because Jesus said in Matthew 5:48 be ye therefore perfect and notice that symmetry Paul is saying the same thing be therefore followers of God and Jesus say be ye therefore perfect even as your father which is in heaven is perfect right and that word there means mature full grown nothing can be added to God to make them more God he is God he's the fullness of God the maturity of God the thinking of God and Jesus be therefore perfect and how do we get there be therefore followers of God as dear children Jesus even said that the the disciple the one that is taught shall become as the teacher and that that's the goal of a teacher is to not always demonstrate to his pupils how much more he knows than them but to bring them up to a place to where they are as him and this is the this is the relationship that God has to his children Ephesians chapter 4 we're going to go ahead and read all the way from verse 7 to verse 16 and let's just walk through this I know we read this in the beginning now let's just look at this nature of God to where he doesn't want us just to be children so I haven't left my thought that God is not a grandpa I made that point to say that God is not a grandpa grandpa because he do and he and he can't be nor does he want to have grandchildren and it's because God is different than man he is hyperfocused and intent on developing you to your fullness I love that not just saying well you know what I'm just going to let them choose what they want to be and what they want to identify as and where they want to go and what they want to do God knows who you are he knows what's in you he knows the gold in you he knows the gifts he knows the the the the the benefits that you can bring to other people and God is focused on giving you all the resources you need as a child of God to become what you're called to be and if we think well that's only in a spiritual sense no it's even in the natural God in the beginning busied himself over his children that's the relationship he established in the beginning Adam and the woman as the children of God and God gave them everything they needed uh watched out over them busied himself with his children because he wanted them to succeed and that is that is the attitude of God to equip us and to teach us and to give us all the things and the tools that we need naturally and spiritually to be everything that we can be spiritually and naturally amen if you're an architect he wants you to be the best architect you can be if you're a stay-at-home mom he wants to equip you and encourage you to be the best stay-at-home mom you can be whatever it is that you might be God is interested in developing you to your full potential Ephesians chapter 4 verse 7 but unto every one of us is given Grace notice that statement every one of us has received a gift of Grace according to the measure of the gift of Christ so we have been given Grace and it's according to this measure of the gift of Christ so there's some measurement there's some uh I don't want to say necessar limit but some fullness some extent to which we've been given this grace and then in the next few verses he shows how that he ascended up on high and led the Captivity captive and this is the releasing from Paradise that we read back in the gospels and then he gave gifts unto men now he's going to pick that back up in verse 11 but then he kind of inserts this parenthetical phrase and I could say this is Paul teaching some really awesome principles in the resurrection he says he that ascended he's the same one that descended first into hell and then uh and emptied out paradise he descended into lower parts of the earth and this same one descend that descended has also ascended far above all heavens and there he says seated at the right hand of the father on high and no that he might fill all things and I believe that he gives us this explanation or this demonstration of the Resurrection The dissension and then the Ascension of Christ again uh so that we could understand this grace that has been given us in this measure of the gift of Christ and it is and and the giving of gifts to men so that he can fill this is the purpose he can fill all things right the ascended Christ is to fill all things and notice how it's done he gave some Apostles and some prophets and some evangelist and some pastors and teachers I think it's interesting that he joins those two together because I believe that a pastor should have the ability to teach and sometimes the worst messes that are made is when pastors can't teach amen thankfully your pastor's a teacher amen but he gave some these gifts and why did he why does he give these five-fold gifts so these Ministries why are they placed in the body and in the church it's for the full the process of the full measure manifesting itself he gave gifts Christ gave gifts and there's a measure of the gift of Christ and he ascends on high and he gives gifts so he might fill all things through these gifts so there's gifts in the body Amen in Colossians 1:18 and he is the head of the body the church who is the beginning the firstborn from the dead that in all things he might have the preeminence this is that he might fill all things the measure of the gift of Christ he doesn't just want to deliver you from smoking and deliver you from drinking and depression he wants to fill every fiber of his be your being he wants to fill every fiber of his church he wants to have preeminence Paul said as I am fully known and possessed by God I want to apprehend him fully and completely I press toward the mark of perfection Ephesians chapter 1: 22 and 23 and have put all things under his feet and gave him to be the head over all things to the church which is his body the fullness of him that filth all in all so where is the fullness of Christ that filth all in all his body so what does Christ want to have preeminence in his church preeminence in his body and it's not the Catholic church it's not the Presbyterian Church it is the individuals who have been born again by an experience with Christ on their own not by a church experience not by sprinkling not by just a confession but they have been born again by the spirit of God that one Spirit baptizes you into the body of Christ and how is he going to have prence by all us yielding the entire Body of Christ each one yielding so that he can have and occupy that full measure of the gift of Christ that's been given to each one of us he is the head of the body that he might have preeminence in all things that he might be the head over all things to the church the fullness of him that filth all in all so he's given the gifts of Apostles and Prophets and evangelists teachers and pastors to do this verse 12 Ephesians 4:12 he's given these gifts for the perfecting of the Saints the maturing of the Saints for the the granting and the giving and the providing of anything that would lack for the resourcing of the individuals so that they can mature for the work of the ministry for the edifying of the body of Christ what is it the building up the promotion of its strength till we all come in the unity of the faith and of the knowledge of the Son of God unto a perfect man so it's not just that we would all be United in faith that we would all have the same knowledge of the Son of God but that we would all mature unto a perfect man that means a full age fully grown mature it means we are to go from babe from from childhood or from a babe to Childhood adolescence to adulthood unto a perfect man unto the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ verse seven he's given unto one each one of us given Grace according to the measure of the gift of Christ and so there's gifts to bring out the full measure of this grace that has been given to us that is the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ the stature of a perfect man so just as Christ grew and increased in wisdom and knowledge and stature and in favor with God and man the Bible says by obedience uh he learned obedience by the things which he suffered in being made perfect so it was the process of the father speaking and Jesus said I say only that which the father has spoken I do only that which the father has shown me to do so Jesus was demonstrating the role as a son who did only what the father told him to do perfect obedience and he was uh acting on the request and the command of God and he learned obedience uh by the things which he suffered and was made perfect he grew to that stature through obedience amen he he learned obedience he did the father's will it was the dynamic of the father teaching him right amen and therefore we see in the scripture in Ephesians 4 that God's word is to edify the body it's given to us until it can mature into the fullness of Christ a perfect man a full age adulthood mature amen and brother bradam teaches he says you can't expect a baby to be born again it's got to grow to it and we grow in Christ to the full stature not somebody get converted tonight tomorrow go preach the gospel we grow up into manhood into the sture of Christ this is what happens and it it's not to say that uh when you when you're you get converted tonight and then tomorrow uh you you're not allowed to testify you're not out of witness or that one wouldn't preach the gospel but he's saying that it's not just that everything's finished and complete and you're completely placed in your gift you're converted on Tuesday night you're completely fully placed in your gift the next day he says no we grow as a babe in Christ into the stature of Christ we grow into manhood I I hope to be min Min in to some some Grace to all of us some mature different SP paces and if we're made perfect through our suffering some of us have to suffer a little bit more than others and and there's certainly a time span that this goes through so I'm I'm wanting to minister Grace to Believers seasoned Believers and maybe just the newborn again Believers and those who've had ups and downs and difficulties that when you were born again you weren't a fully mature son and daughter of God and that explains why we've made the mistakes we have and why we've grown cold and why we've got discouraged and why we've backslid at times it's it's because you weren't fully mature at that time but maybe what you didn't do is engage in the process of growth must grow into manhood what are all these things for what are these gifts for for the perfecting of the Saints the edifying of the body so that they can grow into a perfect man verse 14 this is the exact emphasis of Paul that we henceforth be no more children amen be you dear followers of go be you therefore followers of God as dear children but not that we would always be children not that we would always just be in babbling behind God but that we become more Godlike that we're not just children anymore tossed to and fro and carried about with every wind childhood is marked by ups and downs the learning of bad habits the unlearning of bad habits the promotion of good things encouraged in the right matters discouraged in the wrong matters childhood's marked of up and down tossed carried literally carried literally tossed into the air over and over again there it's all about finding purpose and who am I and and learning what acceptance is and learning to deal with other people and have the right attitude and this is a great responsibility and a role for a parent then to make sure that they the child I is properly taught that they not always be children they not always be given to the whims of the flesh I want to eat it's 2 o'clock in the morning I know where the food is I'm going to go do it but they're taught no you got to discipline yourself you want to be restrained and you want to learn good habits and I know that maybe sometimes the joke is that and people even said this to me that they you know they were in their kitchen eating a gallon of ice cream with the spoon and like this is the Privileges of growing up moving out right like this is it's like all right keep that up the reward for that is diabetes right there's a reason why you don't just live that way and there's a reason why you just don't eat whatever you want to eat so there's a real wisdom in being disciplined nutritiously and and dietarily and and your sleep habits and getting up in the morning making your bed and and washing your car and looking out everything yes making your bed young man yes Glory it's it's like this you do this amen the young man's over there going no no sometimes when when little boys are like that they get married and their wife becomes their mom that we do not be children anymore carried about by every wind of doctr by the slide of men the cunning craftiness whereby they lie and wait to deceive but speaking the truth and I want you to catch this phrase in love this is the love of a parent this is the love of a father this is the love that you have for your children love is corrective love uh May hide a matter but for the sake of promoting good and for the sake of correcting and the sake of restoring speaking the truth in love May grow up into him in all things so this Dynamic of love to grow up into him what is it telling us is this process of being born again and growing in up which is the head Christ which is the head even Christ we saw that in Colossians we saw it already in the first chapter from whom the whole body fitly joined together and compacted by that which every joint supplieth according to the effectual working in the measure of every part maketh increase to the body under the edifying of itself in love speaking the truth in love we grow up and then as the body coalesces together and is instructed in this G this grace that has been given according to the measure of the gift of Christ in each one of us it makes increase of the body as you grow and mature it helps others that's it and it promotes this effective coalescing and unity of the body of Christ under the edifying of itself Amen in love amen amen childhood has certain characteristics and distinct patterns that Paul is talking about but this there's a gift in you there's a measure of Grace in you there's a potential inside of you so the word of God is to cultivate that and to grow it and to feed it and to nurture it so that you can grow up and be spiritually mature Christians he told Timothy to flee youthful lusts why why is it youthful lust it's it's desires and instincts and inclinations of a particular age that you would expect a one of a teenager maybe to act out a certain way and you might expect one of a certain age to be more prone to risk taking and doing certain things they say that uh at 12 years old a child's uh the pleasure center of a child's brain is fully mature in other words they are the the part of them that likes to have fun and experience things will cannot get any more robust it's it it's fullness at by 12 but the the risk assessment part of the brain the the part that can reason and and engage consequence doesn't mature till 21 and so that's the one of the reasons why you see people acting the way that they do during those that stages is it's not because they're evil but it's just they got one side that's fully activated like yeah let's do let's jump off this Cliff right and there's not this other part of the brain that says well you weigh about 180 do we know how deep that is you know do we know how tall we are has anybody else done this before and so that part that's more has the ability to reason and to think about things and work through things hasn't fully developed and Paul is saying hey as children that there's a process there's youthful lust there's things you might be engaging he says but flee them but follow F youthful lust but follow righteousness Faith charity peace with them that call on the Lord out of a pure heart lay aside all this malice and all these things of the Flesh and desire the sincere milk of the word that you may grow thereby and the sermon you must be born again brother bam said there are no shortcuts amen they want to come right quick they don't want to grow we grow in the Lord it takes growth and experience there's there's this idea that people don't they don't want any shortcuts and you want to know what's a really good shortcut is just speak in tongues and you've got it yeah you're you're good you spoke in tongues you got it it's a shortcut because all you got to do is just say something somebody can understand they say you got the Holy Ghost right there's no shortcuts they want to grow we grow in Lord it takes growth and experience tonight you're a sinner tomorrow you're a manifested Son of God he says nonsense where do you get that in the word babies are not born men right not born mature they're not born fully grown he says they're born babies and grow to men babies are not grown ladies but they're nurtured to ladyhood men uh boys are not uh born spiritually into adulthood and manhood but they're nurtured into it the same way that our children are amen but speaking the truth in love to the edifying of itself in love were to grow up from babes to adulthood to maturity right now this maturity as I mentioned before when Paul said my little children I travail in birth until Christ be formed in you he was dealing with the subject of adoption or we could say coming to maturity that's what adoption is connected with are we doing good on time all right okay good I'm just going to look at you when I asked that question you're the pastor if everybody else said no it doesn't matter you're the pastor okay good I just need to know what time our reservations are but Ephesians chapter 1: 3-6 blessed be the God and father of our Lord Jesus Christ who had blessed us with all spiritual blessings in Heavenly places in Christ where we're already seated according to he has chosen Us in him before the foundation of the world that we should be holy and Without Blame before him in love amen but this phrase in some translation says that we should be holy and Without Blame before him and the in love is in verse 5 in love of having predestinated us unto the adoption of children by Jesus Christ to himself according to the good pleasure of his will to the praise of the glory of his grace where he ha made us accepted in the Beloved he has said something quite remarkable here he's writing to the Believers he's writing to those who've already been baptized by the spirit into the body of Christ he's writing to the Saints and who have been elected and by election there's a seed of God inside of you that brings you to a birth brings you to a uh uh to be a babe in Christ but the love of God does not want you to remain wrapped in swaddling clothes lying in a Manger the love of God does not want you to remain a baby completely entirely devoid of speech and understanding but in love in love he's predestinated you unto the adoption of children by Jesus Christ think of what that in love that adoption means amen thank you Lord I'm just getting a little weird weird mechanical sound there so just want to be sure it's not on my end but in love he's predestinated us election is speaks of your birth by for knowledge God ordained you to a birth the the elect can be quickened because there's a seed Gene inside born by The Incorruptible seed of the word of God but predestination isn't focused on the birth it's focused on the growth Amen in love the love of a father he is focused on Us by the the adoption of children or the maturing and the growth of children by Jesus Christ the word Christ didn't die on the cross that he could just have a daycare right he didn't die on the cross we just have a nursery full of babes and and and and in and Cribs but it's by Jesus Christ we are predestined unto adoption praise God and now when I say adoption I know that for uh a lot of people maybe we're only thinking in the human terms or more the modern invention of adoption but scripturally there is a law of adoption and there's an adoption in certain Antiquities or certain cultures uh in ancient times where the law of adoption is not as we would know it today where uh a two uh two parents would choose I keep saying a parent and it reminds me of do do we know when a joke becomes a dad joke when it becomes a parent you're a dad you shouldn't be shaking in your head you should be saying I want to write that down I'm going to use it within the next 12 hours I'm going to use it but this law of adoption isn't the process of taking a child that is not your own that you haven't birthed that has no relation to you which is how we understand adoption to work today you go through an adoption agency they find a child who needs adoption and you maybe give certain parameters or things that you want and it makes this connection of someone prior have you have not previously known have no relationship to now there can be a formal legal process where you take someone you're related to or someone that you have some close close connection to but you do not formally adopt a child that you have been given birth to or that you are legally and DNA actually related to as a parent so this law of adoption scripture is the process of raising a son which is your own into the image and the character nature of the father amen has it it's most understood in that uh in certain cultures and certain uh areas you would have a family business or you'd own a a kingdom you'd have a a business some land or farming and the even scripturally a son is in the Bible the word the Hebrew word for son is the builder of the family name so the father when he had a son he's building he's building the family name he's building the reputation of the family he's raising someone who's going to inherit his legacy and take over what he leaves to him and the Old Testament is just full of the law of inheritance and how land and things are passed down from generation to generation it's all based upon the sons that are born that bear the family name that are Builders of the family name so the goal was to raise a son who could be mature enough to take over and who could carry on the Legacy the right way so the goal of adoption or the idea of adoption is that a son's born into a family and he's taught he's encouraged he's resourced he's equipped and he's watched out over to see that he comes into the image of the father and has the same character the father so the father one day say son it's yours you run the business your name on the check is as good as mine maybe there's a time when the son would go into the fields and go to the shop and go different places says well my dad said or the boss said he said to do it this way but then there and he gives a check to the dad for him to sign but then there comes a time when he's adopted and the father says you have authority to sign the checks you don't have to say my dad said you can just tell the people what to do because you are a chip off the old block to do things the right way and I give you full Authority full power not just uh not just Power Authority but full power oh God is not a man we keep emphasizing that or hope you haven't forgotten that he doesn't adopt a child that's not his child already process of adoption be predestined the adoption of children is about maturity not relationship you're not adopted when you're born again you're you be by born again you you become a Son of God in that you manifest your sunship you manifest the fact that you were elected and because you are Sons he sends forth his spirit because you are elected to this birth he sends forth his Spirit by one Spirit you're baptized in the body of Christ you come forth as a babe in Christ that's not your adoption that's your birth because a scriptural adoption is not about relationship but about increasing to adulthood brother Brandon preached to siries on adoption and he said when the father in the Old Testament understood that his son was come of age and had been seasoned out to adoption come of age it's not just a when you turn 30 you're going to be given it but have you matured do you have the mindset do you have the instincts do you have the Discipline Do you have the testimony he said they're born a child but they're a son they're a son right then but they'll never be no more than just a child or an ordinary son until they mature and show what they are and maturity is at the heart of this concept of adoption in the scripture on a certain day when this child had become matured or when the tutor would come back and say oh well he's well matured the son had to become tutored and trained and brought up getting more matured is is this teaching on adoption it has to do with maturity Galatians 4: 1:5 Paul says now I say that the heir as long as he is a child differ nothing from a servant though he be Lord of all so an heir as long as he is a child as long as he's immature as long as he's unlearned as long as he's unskilled he has has no difference than a servant he may be in entitled to be the heir but as long as he's immature he's no different than the servant he has to do what the father tells him to do sometimes they would work alongside the servants they would be tasked to do the same things and so he's learning he's learning processes he's learning to obey Authority he's learning to appreciate all aspects of the family and the family name and the family business so even though he may be the heir to ultimately be the one in full power and control he has no more Authority and position than a servant if he's still immature so verse two he's put under tutors and governors he's instructed he's taught he's trained until the time appointed of the father even so we when we were children and now he's relating specifically to the Jews were in bondage under the elements of the world but when the fullness of the time was come and I don't mean to get lost in this but the fullness of time that he's referring to is this end of a dispensation the end of the Jewish Church ages the end of the Jewish Church State and the Jewish Church law it was the end of their uh uh looking forward to the Messiah because in Romans 10:4 it says Christ is the end of the law so he was the end of that of the all things that relate to the aim and the purpose of the law he's the Fulfillment of it so he's talking about the Jews the Seed of Abraham who have now received their Messiah so when it came time for the Jews adoption those who had long been circumcised long believed the word of God and been faithful God sent forth his son made of a woman made under the law to redeem them that were under the law that we might receive the adoption of sons it was a fullness of time a time appointed by God he was to bring them Christ the Messiah comes to bring them to their dis their adoption at the end of their dispensation came into his own they looked to him they believed in him they had longed for him to come he comes and most if not almost all of them reject him and so they didn't go to to the upper room to receive the outpouring of the Holy Spirit to be baptized into the body of Christ which was the climax and the Pinnacle of those Jewish ages in the Old Testament and we don't have the time to get into it but we could see that the same pattern repeats itself in the Gentile dispensation the Gentiles are brought in by the baptism of the Holy Ghost they're born into the body of Christ they're babes in Christ they desire the sincere milk of the word God gives them gifts in the body to train them to bring them up to what Paul says option of children by Jesus Christ the word is given is the truth is spoken in love to mature us the truth is spoken in love to that we may grow up that we might be edify edify ourselves in love why because in love we've been predestined unto adoption that's the goal of love that that's the goal of a fatherly love the the fatherly love is and that's where love is so misunderstood there there's a parental love where you never want your children to suffer and what happens they never learn to persevere they never learn grit they never learn uh deter to be persever and determination because everything's just so easily provide you never want them to hurt you never want them to lose you never want them to experience sadness and so there's a way that sometimes there's a perversion of Parental love they withhold instruction they just want them to be themselves and that is a perverted love which is the worst thing for a child but the love of God is I want you to mature I want you to grow in and integrity and honesty and decency this isn't Dogma this isn't religion this is this is growing into the the heart of Christ where you know how to love others that are different than you you know how to have grace and patience for people and you can really be the heartbeat and the pulse of God that's what he desires so the Holy Ghost is in the church there's gifts in the church to teach to train to discipline and to grow the church those gifts are the voice of God giving Commandments the word is the voice of God giving Commandments teaching us instructing us what the word says what God's will is and we're to heed that voice amen so I want to ask the question and I I hope I'd like to finish I would like to finish this and I know an hour is a lengthy sermon already and we're we're pretty close to that but what happens if a child doesn't heed the voice of the parents what happens when we as babes in Christ aren't heeding and listening to the voice of God in 1st Samuel 15: 19 to 23 start with verse 19 he says why didn't you obey the voice of the Lord here in chapter 15 Samuel had given the Commandment by the by the Lord to Saul kill all the amalekites leave nothing living man woman beast you name it let kill them all that's kind of harsh and maybe Saul uh wrestled with that but he was told to kill everything let nothing survive but Saul let he says in his own words the choice things the good things that could be offered a sacrifice we kept those and we killed anything perverse and not allowed by the law and he says and we offered sacrifice and offered worship and Paul says and and and he says it here I have obeyed the voice of the Lord fully I've obeyed you fully and Samuel's like then why do I hear sheep why do I hear the the voice of the the the livestock of the amalekites he said I've I've kept King AAG he says how could have you kept King and fully obeyed why did you not obey the voice of the Lord but did us fly upon the spoil and did evil in the sight of the Lord now that's what a child would do right whatever you do don't eat the cookies don't do it you're not supposed to eat it only do this only do that only halfway like give a kid a an iPad and say 15 minutes and when you're done you put it up now don't follow up right 15 minutes don't put any restrictions on it 15 minutes when the 15 minutes is up put it down two hours later and you're like has it been 15 minutes I don't know has it right and even if you set a timer they have this moment where they got to make this decision is anybody watching is anybody what's am I going to get caught is it it's it's in the nature of a child to push the limits to to find out what the barriers are and what the real boundaries are and he flew upon the spoil and did Evil Bible says woe unto you when your princes are children and here's a king who is a child and Saul said to S yay I I have obeyed the voice of the Lord and have gone the way which the Lord sent me and I brought AAG the came am he didn't even realize the inherent contradiction right he has sitting there and he's got brownie all over his face and Sam says did you eat the brownie he's like no didn't eat the brownie uhuh he I remember when I told the kids that we've got security cameras in our house and it's at that moment they realize what we never knew we didn't have Cameron but then you know stories start changing well in that case I am the one who stole the cookie from the cookie jar and so Saul is so lack so self-awareness I've obeyed and brought the king and have utterly destroyed which should have been utterly destroyed and and but the people took the Sheep the spoil of sheep and oxen the chief things which should which should have been utterly destroyed to sacrif I unto the Lord thy God in gilgal and then just how mature was this for him to blame everybody else and Samuel said hath the Lord as great Delight in burnt offerings I want you catch this and great offerings burnt offerings and sacrifice as in obeying the voice of the Lord behold to obey is better than sacrifice and to hearken than the fat of Rams for Rebellion is the sin of Witchcraft and stubbornness is as iniquity and idolatry what a rebellion and stubbornness a mark of an unruly child a disobedient child scripturally Saul is Promised Paradise we know that when he seeks the prophet Samuel Samuel says you'll be with me in paradise and so it's not his salvation is in question but he lost the throne because of Disobedience and in the principle of adoption a son was always an ad ad a son but if the child was not obedient when it came to that age of maturity in the time that he ought to have matured then he was always a son but brother B said it loses something and Saul was always a son but he lost the throne and he lost the throne for his own son Jonathan he lost his inheritance and this is the process I want you to think of this rebellion and the stubbornness that was manifested in Saul these are marks of one who's never grown up remember when Saul was made King God had to give him another heart why because he wasn't mature well when the prophet said is not the whole desire of Israel upon you he goes what I'm from the smallest tribe and from the least of the families in the tribes he was immature he was insecure he was going to be anointed king they had to go find him God said he hideth among his stuff and he was he was afraid that to be rejected by the people he couldn't trust in God he wasn't willing to take that risk and be rejected by the people publicly Saul never matured his heart couldn't change like David's could and so we lost something in the law of inheritance in Deuteronomy chapter 21 I just want to read this quick and then we're going to be few more scriptures just to get through he said then it shall be when he maketh his sons to inherit he talk about a man who uh has two wives and different Sons by those wives if he maketh his son to inherit that which he hath that he may not make the son of the Beloved firstborn before the son of the hated which is indeed the firstborn in confusing language but if a man has put away his wife and hated her and he has a son who is indeed the firstborn but then has a son by another woman I'm not getting into the legalities of that and and how that would take place but it's just acknowledging the mess of humanity and how things like that happen he said there's one who is indeed the firstborn to whom the right of inheritance belongs but if he loves someone El that loves this woman better so he wants to favor that son there's a rule for this because there is indeed a firstborn he says but he shall acknowledge the son of the hated for the firstborn by giving giving him a double portion of all that he hath for he is the beginning of his strength and the right of the firstborn is his now I've studied on this subject for years and years and years and years and I have I I don't I don't well I I won't even say it but I'll just say this this is the law of adoption in the Old Testament give the firstborn a double portion now notice what it says immediately though after this if a man have a stubborn and your son which will not obey the voice of his father or the voice of his mother and that when they have chastened him will not hearken unto him now this is under the law and this is the harshness of the law thank God we're not under the law under the law if you didn't tithe you were cursed under law if you didn't give your offerings and your tithings you were cursed by God under the New Testament the grace of God you're not cursed if you don't you're just not blessed if you don't that's the beauty of the Covenant the beauty of the New Covenant the beauty of the grace of God it's not that you're threatened to be cursed if you don't pay your tithes and give your offerings it's just you're if you're not doing those things which God ask of you you're just not going to be blessed and so notice the stubbornness and rebellion of a son is exactly what Samuel calls out Rebellion is the sin of Witchcraft and stubbornness is as iniquity and idolatry and so a son who is stubborn and rebellious is one who has is has been deluded and has been deceived has been Bewitched one who is given to idolatry and iniquity rebellion and stubbornness these marks of a child who does not listen to his father and mother and cannot be corrected now this is again the the penalty of the law then shall his father and his mother lay hold to him on him bring him out under the Elders of the city and under the Gate of his place notice how different this is from the ceremony of adoption where the son who was obedient would be brought before the people and it would be acknowledged this son this day this is my beloved Son hear ye him he speaks for me he has all right and Authority he has my seal he has his own seal it is his own name he speaks for himself and there's a ceremony of adoption now it's the reverse before the Elders of the city they say this our son is stubborn and rebellious he will not obey our voice he is a glutton and a drunkard eating ice cream at 2 o'clock in the morning and all the men of the city doesn't make his bed and all the men of the city shall Stone him with stones that he died so shalt thou put evil away from among you and all Israel shall hear and fear there's your law what happens when a child doesn't listen to the voice of God what happens to a child of God when he isn't maturing and growing in the Lord God's not going to take you out and stone you he's not going to publicly castigate you for being a glutton and a drunkard but what happens God is not man who loves you at that baby stage just speaking in tongues and crying and shouting and dancing he do he doesn't he's not a man that wants you to always stay that way he wants you to mature because God is not a grandpa he is he is tased with seeing that you fully develop he's not sufficiently removed from the responsibilities of discipline and instruction and encouraging growth where he can just enjoy you in your Frolic he wants you to grow in 1 Corinthians chap 3: 1:3 Brethren I speak I could not speak unto you as unto spiritual but as unto carnal even as unto babes in Christ this is what happens when you don't grow you don't listen you start making mistakes God corrects you you're babes in Christ I can't speak to a spiritual man and mature but I I speak to as babes he's not taking away their experience he's not taking away their Christianity he's not taking away their birth he's saiding you just haven't become more spiritual you haven't grown so I fed you with milk and not with meat I'd like to give you meat but you haven't developed a spiritual appetite for it you don't have the spiritual teeth you don't have the spiritual wisdom to just not throw a chunk of steak in your mouth and try to swallow it says I got to feed you with milk I got to see you make baby steps and grow and increase and learn so I speak you as babes and I feed you milk not meat hither to you were not able to Bear it neither now are you able he wants to give them meat but they hadn't matured enough says you're yet carnal for whereas there is among you envy and strife and divisions are you not carnal and walk as men there's your childishness there's your pettiness there's your jealousies there's your divisions we're not going to play with you we're going to take our ball and go home it's childish foolish I I spoke at a Men's Conference one time and it was a maybe around a hundred men gathered and I spoke the very opening session of the conference and I opened it by doing a demonstration and I had a ball with me and I found the two strongest men the youngest and strongest men in the whole conference to to come up at the front and I took a ball and I handed it to one young man and I told the other young man I said now get this ball from him they started wrestling up at the front of the conference this is how we open the conference fight fight and the guy finally kept it he St back and I said now I want to show you how to get the ball from him and this guy's like bring it he's like you think you can get this from me I said may I please have the ball and he goes goes I said there's your difference right there's your difference in Youth and enthusiasm and strength and you're going to do it your own and and a man self- serving right but and a man who just says may I please have it it's like oh you can have it that's how adults do things that's how mature people resolve things that's that's how you should go about something you don't use power and privilege and opportunity you use the word you use respect and dignity he says you guys are carnal envy and strife and divisions you're calling you walk as men you say oh men no children in Hebrews 5 he says it this way verses 10 to 14 he speaks of mzc he's called of God a high priest after the order of mzc Jesus Christ after this order of MZ and he says of whom we have many things to say and hard to be uttered in other words I'd love to teach who is this mezic I would love to break it down I'd love to say more but you're a doll of hearing I can't teach you the weigher matters of the law I can't teach you the meteor things in the word of God because you're dull of hearing he says for when you should be teachers you should have grown you should have matured you should have been so learned in the word of God that you could be the one teaching he says you've become children again and you need to be taught the first principles and you become such as have need of milk and not of strong meat you're still spiritually immature and you need milk to grow and you haven't matured to a place where I can give you meat and what is it the scripture saying that when you haven't matured God doesn't give up on you he corrects you and says you need to grow you need to grow up in the message you need to grow up in the word you can't always be aeed you can't always be prone to the same mistakes you can't always carry the same grudges and resentments and and the same habits you've got to keep growing and there's more in the word of God that you can enjoy and there's higher places you can Ascend to but you're only going to do it if you listen and heed the word of God and grow and mature he says you need to be taught the first principles because you're babes he says you are B he's saying you're babes you need to continually be taught you need milk and not strong meat says for everyone that uses milk is unskillful in the word of righteousness the ones that need milk are not skilled in the word for he is a babe but strong meat belongs to the mature strong meat belongs to them that are of full age verse 14 even those who by reason of use have their senses exercised to discern both good and evil there's your neuroplasticity by reason of use by learning the word of God by making application neural pathways are being formed in a spiritual sense you're increasing in the knowledge of the Lord Jesus Christ you're increasing in wisdom and understanding of the word of God and you're experienced in the word of God and so meat belongs to those who have as they have matured and exercised thems in the word they're able to handle it in Hebrews chapter 6 veres 1 to3 the very next chapter he explains what he means they babes they haven't matured but this is what he wants therefore leaving the principles of the doctrine of Christ let us go on unto Perfection this is tootes the perfect one Christ the statue of a perfect man adulthood maturity not laying in the foundation of repentance from dead works and of Faith toward god of the doctrine of baptisms and laying on of hands and the resurrection of the dead and eternal judgment these are all the fundamental things that that this is the milk of the word these are the things that you enjoy you notice sometimes and and I want to be very very clear about this that when one has a genuine experience of the new birth there is a deep change brother said a birth is a mess and for some it can be shouting some it can be crying some it could be D there could be a way that that the experience can manifest itself in different ways and then in that youthful exuberance and enthusiasm what is characteristic of our youth when the spirit of God begins to move they manifest themselves physically and they really really enjoy it and if somebody as they age in the word of God and they grow in the trajectory of the word if they don't exhibit those same characteristics it's not because they've lost their experience they've just grown and so don't take that experience away from young people don't take that away from the youth let them enjoy it but make sure they're getting the word make sure they're getting the word birth and let them enjoy their youth but Paul is saying let us go on to the perfect one let us grow up from these baptisms whether it be water baptism the baptism of the Holy Ghost the laying on of hands and all these fundamental things we believe them we exercise them but we've got to grow up and he says this we will do if God permit God must allow us to come to perfect faith and that's what we're having to come to in this hour is perfection we have to come to perfect faith in order for the rapture we we invite the musicians to come we just close with a story I'm sure you're familiar with it brother brandom tells a story how I think he was in Canada and he was on a horseback he was hunting and he said he got to a ridge and he looked out and he saw these really tall trees that were dead it didn't have leaves and the wind be to blow and as the wind would blow and move the these old [Music] trees and it just he said it's just like they're moaning and groaning and the wind would blow and these uh gloomy dead trees just stiff in the wind and they're moaning and groaning and as he looked he noticed down below there was young trees and he said they were just frolicking frolicking in the wind frolicking enjoying themselves just this uh dancing and waving in the wind he said the same wind that was making the old on dead ones grown was same wind that was making these young ones green ones just enjoy themselves and he said he said it was the wind of the Holy spirit in typ said it's like the wind of the Holy Spirit these young trees green trees they had life in them so they were flexible and they were young just growing and they were shouting and they were rejoicing and he said this these old dead trees could no longer move anymore the life had left them but these green trees could enjoy the presence of the Lord they could enjoy they could wave and they could move and he said if I've ever seen a holy ghost meeting that was one because these young trees could be responsive but that young tree now some people might sayi want this tree to stay young forever but that's not the purpose of the tree it it's not to be a sapling it it it's to come to fruit it's to come to maturity it's to Bear seeds to bring forth more that's the goal the greenness the greenness in this respect was showing that there's life in it for it to grow and not that it would ever stop moving in the wind but it wasn't just to stay in that place nor do you want to be dead but the goal was not just Frolic but the goal was that wind was to Shake The Roots and get them to go down deeper to stabilize them so that they could what keep life in them and they could grow and they could mature brother brandham says and Christ has revealed in his own word he said that's what's the problem with the message today or that's the matter with the message today sorry those who obtain it the word the message in their hearts must lay in the presence of the sun to be ripened the scriptural word ripen is mature when the grapes are ripe matured in other words they can't there no no more time on the vine will make it more mature when something's ripe what happens if it stays on the vine begins to rot so it's like this is the perfect moment the climax where it's fully mature this is the moment where it's at its peak its best he says it has to lay in the presence of the ripen he says you can pick up the message then let the sun bake all the greenness out of you making matured Christians that's what we want God to do I want to be in the word of God I want to be in the presence of God I want to be in fellowship with the people of God I want to be obedient to the voice of God so that I can not just be this young whipper snapper tossed about by every wind and uh wrestling Here There and up and down and in and out but I want to grow and I want to increase and I want to become a mature Christian I said all that to say that God is not a grandpa in other words he doesn't love you at that little Stage 5 years old just cute as a button telling funny stories getting your saying mixed up he is a father who in love loves you at two loves you at three loves you at eight loves you at 13 right he doesn't have terrible twos right they're terrific twos he loves you loves you as a teenager loves you in that stage when maybe you're a little bit ashamed and don't want to sit at the same table with them he love he loves you through all of it and he's got a plan to bring you to maturity and he's not going to give up on you because in love he's Duty bound to bring you to this place of maturity and that's what it means that God is not a grandpa is he doesn't want he doesn't want you in a nursery doesn't want you in a crib doesn't want you in a daycare he wants you to grow up completely and if we're not careful there's voices and there's attitudes that want to keep us forever young here right and then we get it out of order because once we've reached our maturity there comes a point when this body of Christ can no longer remain in the presence of the Sun and get more ripe because Jesus said as soon as the Harvest is soon as it comes the Harvest has come the maturity has come it's at its peak the Rapture comes the Harvest comes and the sickle is brought forth and we'll go to meet him in the air and there there will be an eternal youth meeting in our youth but yet fully matured Sons and Daughters of God Amen God bless you thanks for your patience today that was a long one maybe for the visitors that was a really long one but God bless you let's stand brother John I don't I doubt you preached that long so I want the visitors to know this is maybe not a customary I'm the long-winded preacher from Arizona but God bless you I just I so grateful to I ministered things I ministered these things today that I think I mentioned Wednesday I've been studying on for quite some time haven't even ministered at our home church so it's nice to be in a place where you know you can have I have the Liberty just to teach these things in the word of God let's just bow our heads in a word of prayer before we turn it over to Brother John we know that one day there is going to be a meeting in the air and at that day we're going to be in our youth going to be in perfect bodies and perfect Minds never to be sick again but I say in the meantime Lord let it be our prayer that we grow and may we even as parents take a more active role in teaching our children the right things promoting the right virtues Desiring to see them have their own experience that we can be participants and co-workers with God to see that our children are growing in the grace of God and coming to maturity and let us Avail ourselves to God to the resources that he put in our lives of a of a pastor a gift of a pastor and Brother Bruce who ministers the word of God and the other gifts in the body of Christ may we just Avail ourselves to the body of Christ that it can edify Us in love make an increase of the gift that's in my life so that I could come to maturity Also let's pray heavenly father today Lord as we just in this part of the service we ask for Grace upon us I would say first and foremost Lord that through the the breadth of this sermon and just the sheer amount of scripture and principles that were shared made this simple thought and that that beautiful uh line that was just woven into this fabric of growing up yes and how that there is this tendency in this human sense to want to keep keep children of God as babes Lord even ministers sometimes in movements will try to keep the children of God as babes because they can tell them what to do they can manipulate them through Sensations and Fantastics and incentivize them to certain things by making promises and when they remain children they remain babes they can be manipulated they can be controlled they can be led astray and sometimes men maybe not even intentionally but they don't realize that what they're doing is their stunting the growth in the maturity of your children and Lord may we not take comfort in stages of adolescence and being a toddler even infants or babes but Lord may we desire to grow ourselves and may we seek out obedience to your word that we can mature and that we can grow and may may we be more active participants not just in our own growth but in the growth of others that we might mature and increase and father I pray help us with our discernment Lord in this hour we don't want uh our churches to be daycares we don't want our churches to be nurseries Lord we don't want as ministers to be babysitters and nor do we want our families just to be ruled with a rod of iron and constantly chastising and disciplining and never see growth but Lord give us the grace to know how to deal with stubbornness and Rebellion give us the grace to know how to deal with it in our own Hearts but Lord we do see in the word that when children are rebellious and stubborn you admonish them to grow to lay aside to persevere and to not be caught in Youth and in experience I commit everybody to you today pray that you bless them and strengthen them encourage them Father as they've been so attentive and they've listened so beautifully to your word Lord may you bless them I pray in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ we ask these things amen amen God bless you we love you very much brother John appreciate the privilege uh in letting me Minister and even just maybe do it in a more personal way and so may God bless you we love you [Applause] John oh my that that was everything that was a masterpiece it really was we needed that amen we needed that and we we need to follow through now right we need to follow through we can't be satisfied with just hearing the perfect word we've got to take this word home we're g to meditate on it and and and pray God help us in our home to begin to mature what you've called us to be amen because it's more than just the Badge of them in the message but it's the one thing that spoke so much to me is that if we are truly growing ourselves as individuals we can't but help to help others grow so if we're not trying to help somebody to grow it kind of shineing the light where what's happening inside of us our goal should be growth amen I just appreciated that message and how many want uh brother Aaron to take send the light screen gretings back to Arizona's believing church amen amen praise the Lord let's just sing I am so needy Lord amen after I after that message I feel so needy amen I am so needy Lord so needy of you I am so need Lord to be more like you share all my rights away in this world of sin I am so needy Lord
