[18:27] prayer and um
[18:30] I believe it would be a blessing to the
[18:32] youth amen
[18:34] amen
[18:35] Let's uh
[18:38] we just have a
[18:40] James has a testimony in maybe a song
[18:45] did you wanna
[18:47] come up James
[19:10] I'm sorry
[19:15] so uh I just have a testimony of how
[19:18] God's been using you lately
[19:21] um lately God's been using my gift of
[19:23] playing the piano God's helped me extend
[19:26] my spiritual life and my gift to playing
[19:27] the piano wait for them before over the
[19:30] past one year and I see some God things
[19:34] God's been doing in my life that I
[19:36] couldn't see before
[19:37] and he's been using my gift of the piano
[19:39] to get his people in his presence I
[19:42] couldn't used to sing and play together
[19:44] at all and I see God has saved me from
[19:46] several situations where I wasn't
[19:48] prepared and the Saints wouldn't be able
[19:50] to get into his presence and worship him
[19:52] and I would like to share those moments
[19:54] with you so the first time this happened
[19:57] I was in another church it had a bigger
[20:00] congregation in our little Lighthouse
[20:01] here in Fenton so it was a lot more
[20:03] pressure on me and I was going to play a
[20:05] special with another person
[20:07] I felt God was wanting me to play the
[20:10] special alone but the church was bigger
[20:11] than ours and I never played in front of
[20:13] an audience bigger than 25 people
[20:16] so I asked this friend do you want to do
[20:19] it with me and they said yes
[20:21] so we went to this church for this
[20:23] special service
[20:25] and uh and we were going to play this
[20:27] special together but the thing was that
[20:29] wasn't God's will so we sat through the
[20:31] other specials and they started the
[20:33] service later I found out the message
[20:35] never even got to the song later this
[20:38] happened several more times to me
[20:39] because it wasn't God's time
[20:41] so that's my testimony I hope it
[20:43] encourages you and shows that God cares
[20:45] for every one of his children's needs no
[20:47] matter how the size
[20:49] God bless you

[34:29] would like to open our Bibles to Matthew
[34:33] 14 and we'll start with verse 22.
[34:37] but before we begin reading like this to
[34:40] open up in a word of prayer and just
[34:42] invite the author to speak to our hearts
[34:45] personally this is bow our heads dear
[34:48] heavenly father we
[34:49] thank you Lord for letting us be in your
[34:51] house this evening Lord we counted such
[34:54] a privilege and an honor Lord just to be
[34:55] in your house to receive from you
[34:58] Lord I pray just prepare our hearts Lord
[35:00] to soften the ground that we could
[35:02] receive your engrafted word Lord
[35:04] father I pray you move me your unworthy
[35:06] servant out the way Lord I don't have
[35:08] anything for the people Lord only you do
[35:10] and I pray you just open the windows of
[35:12] Heaven Lord in his poor Revelation Upon
[35:14] Us Lord and just write your word upon
[35:16] our hearts Lord and just Quicken that
[35:19] word into our hearts Lord and father may
[35:21] we all have a testimony that our hearts
[35:24] burn within us and that we heard
[35:25] personally from you dear Lord Jesus and
[35:27] I pray you just bless each need that we
[35:29] would have Lord spiritual and physical
[35:31] Lord and father just give us eyes to see
[35:33] and ears to hear Lord what you'll have
[35:35] to say to us personally we ask all these
[35:37] things in Jesus Christ and we pray amen
[35:41] so reverse um
[35:43] 22 very familiar scriptures readings
[35:47] whether it be seated after we finish
[35:48] this one and straightway Jesus
[35:50] constrained his disciples to get into
[35:52] the ship
[35:54] and to go before him onto the other side
[35:56] while he sent the multitudes away
[35:59] and we had sent the multitudes away he
[36:02] went up into a mountain apart to pray
[36:04] and when the evening was come he was
[36:07] there alone but the ship was in the
[36:09] midst of the sea tossed with waves for
[36:12] the wind was contrary
[36:14] verse 25 and in the Fourth Watch of the
[36:17] night Jesus went unto them walking on
[36:20] the sea and when the disciples saw him
[36:23] walking on the sea they were troubled
[36:25] saying it is a spirit
[36:27] and they cried out for fear but
[36:30] straightway Jesus spoke unto them sing
[36:32] be of good cheer it is I be not afraid
[36:36] and Peter answered him and said Lord if
[36:39] if it be thou bid me come unto thee on
[36:42] the water and he said come
[36:44] and when Peter was come down out of the
[36:46] ship he walked on the water to go to
[36:48] Jesus
[36:49] but when he saw the wind of mistress he
[36:52] was afraid and beginning to sink he
[36:54] cried saying Lord save me and
[36:58] immediately Jesus stretched forth his
[37:00] hand and caught him and said unto him oh
[37:02] thou little faith wherefore it is thou
[37:05] doubt may the Lord add the blessings
[37:07] upon his word you may be seated
[37:10] and so sometimes we're in a familiar
[37:12] situation like Peter was Jesus tells us
[37:16] to come and we come by faith and then
[37:19] everything starts to go wrong around us
[37:22] trials start coming issues start
[37:24] happening in the family and then we
[37:26] start to take our eyes off of Jesus
[37:28] before I get any further the type of
[37:30] this message is keep your eyes on Christ
[37:34] amen and then the subject keeping your
[37:36] eyes on his promises see this is one of
[37:38] the hardest ages to live in because we
[37:41] have so much distractions so many
[37:42] problems arising we see governments
[37:45] arising we see issues Wars going on and
[37:48] all these things that are trying to
[37:49] shake our faith all these things are
[37:51] trying to shake us to get us to move but
[37:54] we have to be we have to stand upon the
[37:56] rock the unmovable Rock you and that's
[37:59] Jesus Christ our anchor has to be in him
[38:01] and him alone it can't be the next
[38:04] president win an election it can't be uh
[38:07] the the next this that or that or that
[38:10] the next new TV show the next new
[38:11] intervention see these things are going
[38:13] to fail these things can't hold you
[38:15] these things aren't gonna uh help you
[38:18] any any way in shape or form and so
[38:21] let's go to Mark 4 verses 35 through 41
[38:24] so we just see how important faith is to
[38:27] keep our eyes on Christ no matter if the
[38:31] ship is sinking no matter if the boat's
[38:33] filling with water we have to just
[38:35] believe that Christ is with us he
[38:37] promised with you and in You Until the
[38:39] End of the Age so if that promise is is
[38:42] better than gold it's way better than
[38:45] gold
[38:46] and so go to mark IV and we'll start
[38:48] with verse 35 another very familiar
[38:51] scripture
[38:52] amen
[38:54] amen
[38:55] let me get there myself
[39:00] and the same day when the Eve was come
[39:02] he saith unto them let us pass over unto
[39:04] the other side so another very it's like
[39:07] almost a very familiar uh picture being
[39:10] painted again
[39:11] and when they had sent away the
[39:13] multitude they took him even as he was
[39:15] in the ship and there was also with him
[39:17] in other little ships
[39:19] and there arose a great storm of wind
[39:21] and the waves beaten to the ship so was
[39:24] now full and he was in the hinder part
[39:27] of the ship I love that he was there the
[39:28] whole entire time
[39:30] asleep on the pillow and they awake him
[39:32] and they say nothing to him Master cares
[39:34] and thou not that we perish and he arose
[39:37] and rebuked the wind and said unto the
[39:39] sea peace be still
[39:41] and the wind cease knows a great call
[39:44] and he said unto them why are you so
[39:46] fearful
[39:47] how is it that you have no faith so we
[39:50] see in both scriptures Jesus is
[39:52] mentioning them having no faith
[39:55] and so
[39:57] we gotta have faith in every situation
[40:00] that we're going on God's going to lead
[40:02] us into situations where we've never
[40:04] been before Uncharted Territory
[40:06] and we have to believe that God is
[40:08] leading us the right way because God
[40:11] just doesn't lead you to lead you he
[40:12] just doesn't put you in Trials to put
[40:14] you in Trials but he has a specific
[40:16] purpose for you in that trial growth in
[40:19] that trial and we have to believe that
[40:21] God is seeing something in us that we
[40:24] can't see he's trying to bring out some
[40:26] potential that we may not be able to see
[40:29] but we have to trust that that potential
[40:32] is going to be brought out and it could
[40:34] be months it could be years whatever it
[40:36] is we have to trust that
[40:37] his will is going to be done if we let
[40:40] it
[40:41] so through the hardest times the Far
[40:43] East trials we have to keep the faith we
[40:46] have to keep the faith
[40:48] he even said in uh if we go to Jude this
[40:50] is not my notes but we'll go to Jude
[40:53] chapter one
[40:56] Jude chapter one very familiar scripture
[41:00] and we'll go to verse three beloved
[41:03] when I gave all diligence to write unto
[41:05] you of the common salvation it was
[41:08] needful for me to write unto you
[41:11] that you should earnestly contend for
[41:14] the faith which was once delivered unto
[41:16] the Saints so the same faith that Peter
[41:19] and Paul and Matthew and John and
[41:22] disciples have we can have that same
[41:24] faith today it's still the same God that
[41:27] was in the book of Acts that is is today
[41:29] he's the same yesterday today and
[41:31] forever we believe that if Jesus
[41:34] could could save the disciples out that
[41:37] storm then Jesus can do the same thing
[41:40] of our life if we have the faith we
[41:42] don't have to cry and say Lord save me
[41:44] we're going to know that he's going to
[41:46] save us because he's promised to save us
[41:48] he's promised he's a God that comes in
[41:50] the a present time and the wonderful
[41:53] time and so we just see
[41:56] this common salvation is the same
[41:58] salvation they had back in that time we
[42:01] have to believe that the same holy ghost
[42:02] that gave them leadership that changed
[42:05] their nature can change our nature right
[42:07] now this very moment the preaching of
[42:10] the word
[42:11] we have to be able to receive it our
[42:12] hearts have to be hungry for that word
[42:14] for God to change us verse 4 for there
[42:18] are certain men creeping unawares who
[42:20] are before of old ordained to this
[42:23] condemnation ungodly men turning the
[42:26] grace of our God into lasciviousness in
[42:28] denying the only Lord God in our Lord
[42:31] Jesus Christ
[42:32] so we just see that we had earnestly
[42:35] contend we earnestly continue you gotta
[42:38] fight every inch John the Baptist said
[42:41] the Kingdom of Heaven has suffered
[42:43] violence and the violent take it by
[42:45] force so you have to take your walk by
[42:47] force the devil is not going to lay down
[42:50] and this lets you have it easy but he's
[42:52] going to put every roadblock every fiery
[42:55] Dart everything he can to stop you from
[42:58] getting to your goal to keep your eyes
[43:00] on Christ because he knows we he knows
[43:02] when you get your eyes on Christ then he
[43:05] is defeated but if he can get you just
[43:07] to turn away for one second like he did
[43:09] Peter you will begin to sink
[43:12] and this is let's say this is the
[43:14] hardest age to live in but it's not
[43:16] impossible through God I can do all
[43:18] things through Christ who what
[43:19] strengthens me he'll give you the
[43:21] strength that you need he'll give you
[43:23] the the Boost that you need he'll carry
[43:25] you when you can't walk anymore
[43:27] amen
[43:29] so no matter what's happening in our
[43:31] life no matter if the waters
[43:34] if we're drop will think we're drowning
[43:35] if our ship is sinking just believe that
[43:37] Jesus is in the hindered part of your
[43:39] ship you got to believe that he's in
[43:41] control but you got to let him be in
[43:43] control first
[43:44] amen
[43:46] a little quote from brother Brandon
[43:47] proof of his resurrection the
[43:49] emancipation of the Proclamation has
[43:51] been signed you're free and you just
[43:53] don't know it but Faith must have a
[43:55] Divine resting place
[43:57] so Faith as half the resting place you
[43:59] can't question you can't doubt you can't
[44:01] waver but your faith has to be so
[44:04] anchored that nothing can move you your
[44:07] faith has to be unmovable no matter what
[44:10] the situation may be
[44:11] if you have faith in God you've got to
[44:14] have Divine resting amen a place to be
[44:17] and there's no better place and no other
[44:20] Divine Way only through God's holy word
[44:25] so the only absolute that you're going
[44:27] to have in this world is this Bible it's
[44:30] the only thing that won't lie to you is
[44:31] the only thing that will be manifested
[44:32] to you is this Bible the government's
[44:34] going to lie
[44:36] um your family member might lie to you
[44:37] not purposely but by accident but this
[44:39] word can never lie the scripture says
[44:42] he's not a man that can tell a lie he
[44:44] can't amen he's never failed not one
[44:46] time and we can all testify of God
[44:48] coming through every single time it may
[44:51] not have been our timing what we wanted
[44:52] but God is going to come in the right
[44:55] time you just got to believe that when
[44:57] it says they that wait upon the Lord
[44:59] they shall renew their strength so you
[45:01] got to believe it it's not a time period
[45:03] that he gives you but he says they that
[45:05] wait upon the Lord and he'll give you
[45:07] the strength in the due season the
[45:08] perfect season that you need it in amen
[45:11] so we see the enemy
[45:13] he's constantly trying to get us to
[45:15] doubt
[45:16] and we look back in the Garden of Eden
[45:19] we see what happened to Eve the devil
[45:22] made Eve think that there was something
[45:24] better outside of God's word that God
[45:26] what God Said wasn't good enough but
[45:28] there was more than what God Said and if
[45:31] Satan can get us to doubt One spec one
[45:35] inch one percentage a point percentage
[45:37] then he's got us to compromise
[45:40] and we can't compromise with the word of
[45:42] God see we're expecting God to do all
[45:44] these wonderful things in our life
[45:46] but we're not following the simple words
[45:48] the ABCs of the word see we can't expect
[45:51] God to move in our life if we're
[45:53] compromising with what God is calling us
[45:55] to do
[45:56] obedience is better than sacrifice
[45:59] so no matter the situation we got to be
[46:02] obedient to the word
[46:04] Haman
[46:05] so what does it mean to keep your eyes
[46:07] focused on something it means you're
[46:10] only focus is on one particular thing
[46:12] which is Jesus Christ
[46:14] and you're not letting anything else
[46:16] distract you you know your goal you know
[46:18] your target I need Jesus in my life I
[46:21] need him every hour every second in my
[46:23] life that's why prayer must be a
[46:26] priority in your life prayer is that's
[46:29] your Lifeline if you have no prayer life
[46:31] you you have no life and so prayer must
[46:34] be our priority no matter how busy we
[46:37] are as brother Marty said no matter how
[46:39] hectic our day is but prayer is going to
[46:42] be the keeping power that you need
[46:44] because prayer is the direct connection
[46:47] between the throne room of God that's
[46:49] how you get to know God more that's how
[46:51] he can answer prayers is you building a
[46:54] personal relationship with him and the
[46:56] more you build that relationship with
[46:58] him the more you get to know him the
[47:00] more you see how he he thinks the more
[47:03] you see how his ways are because the
[47:05] Bible tells us his ways are not our ways
[47:08] and his thoughts are not our thoughts
[47:10] so the more we can get that mind of
[47:11] Christ the more we can spend time in
[47:13] prayer and that's how the mind of Christ
[47:15] is obtained is through prayer and look
[47:18] the word up Focus it's a central point
[47:20] of conscious concentration so an
[47:24] adjustment for a distinct Vision so we
[47:27] constantly got to focus our walk because
[47:29] sometimes we might get knocked off to
[47:32] the right and we're a little blurry we
[47:34] got to make sure that we're always doing
[47:36] self-examination amen to seeing who who
[47:40] we really are because there's a lot of
[47:41] times where we think that we're doing
[47:43] something right but in reality we're
[47:45] just a little bit off a couple
[47:47] centimeters and so that's why I see
[47:49] David was a man of uh self-examination
[47:52] and you see that self-examination really
[47:55] helps to know where you're at with your
[47:58] walk with God because it's so easy to
[48:00] think well I'm good enough I prayed
[48:03] today you know I'm not what I used to be
[48:05] two years ago or five years ago but you
[48:08] got to constantly be just taking
[48:09] inventory self-inventory
[48:11] amen
[48:13] I got a camera up there coming down I
[48:15] didn't know how to take a picture I
[48:17] looked through the thing and man I could
[48:19] see five or six different objects so I
[48:21] begin to focus it Billy
[48:24] said focus it they'll all come to one
[48:27] it's a good idea to do that you know you
[48:29] see things different when you go to
[48:31] focusing and use God's word for a focus
[48:35] on him I love that you'll see what I'm
[48:38] talking about but get it in Focus first
[48:39] you see so if you want to see God you
[48:42] have to see him in his word his word has
[48:44] to be revealed to you
[48:46] see you can't just try to seek God
[48:48] without putting the word together at one
[48:52] because God his word are one you can't
[48:54] separate the two
[48:56] because we got all these beautiful
[48:57] promises in here that what we're going
[48:59] to be what we're going to be right now
[49:01] and we got to believe that every promise
[49:04] in the book is mine personally you got
[49:06] to believe it personally not because
[49:07] brother John believes because you
[49:09] believe it personally
[49:11] right we got to get ourselves focused to
[49:13] whether we live or die sink or drown
[49:16] it's Calvary I love that Christ that's
[49:18] the thing God want God wants us to come
[49:21] back to so we got to just get focused at
[49:23] Calvary Christ even Paul said this
[49:26] statement I know anything but Christ and
[49:28] him crucified that's how personal we
[49:30] need to get with our walk because if it
[49:33] says Christ in him crucified then you're
[49:35] not going to get distracted because
[49:36] you're going to realize that if he
[49:38] didn't die for me I couldn't be here
[49:40] today I wouldn't be the man I am or the
[49:42] woman I am today because of what he did
[49:44] for me and if you keep that indebtedness
[49:47] it just helps you to keep focus on the
[49:49] prize keep focused on what he's calling
[49:51] us to be
[49:53] so we're living in age of great
[49:55] distraction how many can say Amen to
[49:57] that
[49:58] the prophet said it's the hardest age to
[50:00] live in we see all the pressure around
[50:02] us every pressure you can see kovid was
[50:05] before that great pressure put upon the
[50:07] whole entire world
[50:09] and there's so many other things trying
[50:11] to take our attention away from Christ
[50:13] it could be job situations it could be
[50:16] family problems it could be you fill in
[50:19] the blank it could be I got to pay my
[50:22] bills and this x amount of time where I
[50:24] got debt I got to pay off I can keep on
[50:26] going for the depressions that that
[50:28] Satan tries to get at us and the thing
[50:30] is Satan doesn't use necessarily bad
[50:33] things but he uses good things
[50:36] like family it could be family it could
[50:39] be whatever it is
[50:40] you fill in the blank with your business
[50:42] whatever it could be
[50:44] and the thing is what the devil does
[50:46] what that is he gets you to compromise
[50:48] say well
[50:51] God knows you need to pay this and he
[50:53] knows you need to do this you know you
[50:55] could you could take it you could take
[50:56] some time off today you know pray a
[50:58] little bit later today and that later
[50:59] today turns into tomorrow and that's how
[51:02] the devil works if he gets you to
[51:03] compromise and end she's going to take a
[51:05] mile that's just how he does and so but
[51:07] when we compromise we lose our strength
[51:10] amen because we see what happened to
[51:13] Adam and Eve they lost everything
[51:15] literally they lost everything by just
[51:17] compromising on point one percent of the
[51:19] word and so we can't compromise one iota
[51:23] line upon line precept upon precept
[51:26] that's just a thing that we have to do
[51:28] and that's the thing that broke The
[51:30] Fellowship Of Eden it's because Eve
[51:33] failed to keep the focus
[51:35] of her looking on God's word and
[51:38] listening to the reasonings of the enemy
[51:40] that's why you ever heard that statement
[51:42] a mind's a terrible thing to waste it's
[51:46] a very terrible thing to waste because
[51:47] the devil chose the mind and he's
[51:50] constantly going to put these thoughts
[51:52] into your head and you can't stop them
[51:54] from coming but you can stop them from
[51:56] staying in your mind and you got to just
[51:58] kick those reasonings out because the
[52:01] word of God doesn't reason the word of
[52:03] God is forever settled in heaven so if
[52:05] the word of God says I'm gonna be healed
[52:07] then I'm going to be healed if the word
[52:08] of God said that he's Jehovah Jireh he's
[52:10] going to provide for my knees and he's
[52:12] going to provide for my needs if if the
[52:14] word says I can have deliverance and
[52:16] guess what I'm going to have Deliverance
[52:18] if if the word says I can have uh
[52:20] Financial Freedom or uh let's see free
[52:23] of um living words if the word says that
[52:26] I can have a my family be saved
[52:29] then I believe my fame is going to be
[52:31] saved I got to apply that token I may
[52:34] not be able to see it right now
[52:36] but I know by eyes of faith that they're
[52:38] going to be saved because the word
[52:39] claims that they're going to be saved
[52:42] amen
[52:44] amen
[52:45] so if she stayed right with Gods so that
[52:48] settles it God said so but she didn't
[52:51] want to do that see
[52:53] she changed the focus of her glass and
[52:55] begin to see instead of being just one
[52:58] way there become two ways
[53:01] she saw well now maybe this man could be
[53:03] right maybe he is right now we know God
[53:06] is right and maybe his right this is
[53:08] just more light than what God Said you
[53:10] see there so we can't help between two
[53:12] opinions that's what the word tells us
[53:14] if God is God believe he's God if he's
[53:16] not then don't but he is God so why not
[53:19] believe him
[53:20] What's It Gonna Hurt You it's only going
[53:22] to help you
[53:23] amen
[53:25] so so we we see that we look at the back
[53:28] of the book and it says we win
[53:30] so why what what fear should we have
[53:34] he promised the victory God promised the
[53:37] victory
[53:38] amen we just have to follow the battle
[53:39] strategy
[53:41] no no person in history that won a war
[53:44] didn't have some sort of strategy that
[53:47] they had to follow they had to you go to
[53:49] World War II World War One you go to a
[53:51] civil war some form they had a battle
[53:54] strategy that if everybody wasn't in one
[53:56] Accord then
[53:58] they would have lost the battle so we
[54:00] want to see what our battle strategy is
[54:01] and the type of equipment that we need
[54:03] to fight this battle in Ephesians 6.
[54:07] this isn't something this isn't
[54:09] something that you just put on every
[54:10] once in a while but this is something
[54:12] that you need to have on a daily basis
[54:14] because the enemy knows that he can
[54:18] defeat you at any time anywhere if
[54:21] you're not connected with God but he
[54:23] knows if you're connected with God and
[54:25] have your proper Army attire on because
[54:28] who's a soldier here amen we're all
[54:30] soldiers on the cross right
[54:32] and what a soldier needs proper
[54:34] equipment right
[54:35] amen so go to Ephesians 6 and we'll
[54:38] start with verse 10.
[54:40] see first we got to recognize that our
[54:42] strength cannot get the job done that's
[54:44] right it just came a man or woman's
[54:47] strength cannot get the job done even a
[54:49] man's best is Vanity and so we got to
[54:52] recognize that we can't do it alone it's
[54:54] impossible
[54:55] so it says finally my brethren look what
[54:58] it says be strong in the Lord and in the
[55:00] power of His might so it takes your
[55:03] strength out the equation it takes your
[55:04] intellects out the equation and you're
[55:07] now focusing on God finally my brother
[55:09] and be strong in the Lord and in the
[55:11] power of His might verse 11 says put on
[55:15] half or it says whole put on the whole
[55:18] armor of God so you can't just pick oh I
[55:20] just want the The Shield so I can just
[55:22] block the fiery darts but you need every
[55:24] piece
[55:25] put on the whole armor of God that ye
[55:28] may be able to stand against the walls
[55:31] of the devil so if you want to stand
[55:33] against the walls of the devil you got
[55:36] to put the whole armor of God on that's
[55:38] the only way and then verse 12 which you
[55:41] really got to recognize is that this is
[55:44] not a we're not wrestling against flesh
[55:46] and blood but against principalities I'm
[55:48] not fighting against you you're not
[55:49] fighting against the government but
[55:51] flesh and blood but against
[55:52] principalities you got to recognize this
[55:55] is a spiritual warfare and you can't
[55:57] fight a spiritual warfare with carnality
[56:00] you got to fight spirit with spirit it's
[56:02] the only way that's why you can see why
[56:05] Paul said be strong in the Lord and the
[56:07] power of His might
[56:08] before we wrestle not against flesh and
[56:10] blood but against principalities against
[56:12] Powers against the rulers of the
[56:14] darkness of this world against spiritual
[56:17] wickedness in high places verse 13.
[56:21] wherefore take unto you the whole armor
[56:23] of God so this seems like it's very
[56:25] important because Paul is mentioning
[56:28] once again the whole armor of God for a
[56:30] reason
[56:31] that ye may be able to withstand in the
[56:33] evil day in having done all to stand how
[56:36] many believe we're living in an evil day
[56:38] just want to be able to stand you got to
[56:40] put the full armor of God on that's what
[56:42] it's telling us right here says stand
[56:44] there for having your loins Girt with
[56:46] truth having on the breastplate of
[56:48] righteousness and your feet shot with
[56:51] the preparation of the gospel of peace
[56:54] and look what 16 says above all
[56:57] taking the shield of faith if you don't
[56:59] have faith in this armor then how is the
[57:01] armor ever going to work it's like when
[57:03] Jesus he couldn't do many Works in a
[57:05] certain city because of the unbelief and
[57:08] he was still the same God but God can't
[57:10] God doesn't move unless you let him move
[57:13] that's right and the same thing is you
[57:15] got to believe that this armor is just
[57:17] what you need it's going to fortify you
[57:19] the way it needs to fortify you so above
[57:21] all taking the shield of Faith wherewith
[57:23] you shall be able to quench all the
[57:25] fiery darts of the wicked all those
[57:26] thoughts he's going to try and plant you
[57:28] just take that Shield
[57:30] and just let them bounce right off
[57:32] and take the helmet of salvation I love
[57:35] that and the sword of the spirit which
[57:37] is the word of God look at verse 18.
[57:40] this is so key right here if if you
[57:42] don't have this then you can't have the
[57:44] armor praying always
[57:46] with all prayer and supplication
[57:50] does it say in the flesh no no in the
[57:53] spirit and it says watching watching
[57:56] there unto with all perseverance and
[57:59] supplication for All Saints so I love
[58:02] how in Schofield it says the Warriors
[58:04] resource so the prayer is the Warriors
[58:07] resource if the if the warrior
[58:10] the prayer that the warrior wants to
[58:12] keep his armor on he has to be a prayer
[58:14] Warrior you have to be
[58:16] because you live in such an age where we
[58:19] have so many voices trying to talk to us
[58:21] trying to get us to go over here and go
[58:22] over there and we got to silence all
[58:24] those voices and get alone in our prayer
[58:26] closet and hear the one great voice
[58:28] that's going to change us from the
[58:30] inside out it's going to give us the
[58:32] leadership that we need that's going to
[58:34] give us the help that we need because
[58:36] he's a help we said before in a present
[58:38] time
[58:39] amen let's go to Romans 6.
[58:43] so
[58:45] in order to keep our eyes on Christ
[58:47] we have to recognize the Enemy Within
[58:50] right amen
[58:52] because the only person that's going to
[58:54] keep you from growing in Christ is
[58:56] yourself that's right
[58:58] you're your biggest enemy as they say
[59:01] and how many decisions have we wrong
[59:04] decisions have we made because we didn't
[59:06] take it to prayer and who who to blame
[59:09] but ourselves because we didn't take the
[59:11] time to pray about or take the time to
[59:13] really analyze the situation
[59:15] and so and we could say Satan is our
[59:17] enemy as well but Satan can only use a
[59:21] yielded vessel as our brother John said
[59:23] the other day so only way Satan can
[59:26] cause us harm if we yield
[59:30] our carnal flesh to him that's right
[59:32] that's the only way
[59:33] because Satan can't force itself upon
[59:36] you unless you give him something to
[59:37] come into just like the Beast he yielded
[59:40] himself to be used by Satan
[59:42] as good as um Romans 6 and we'll start
[59:44] with verse six
[59:46] knowing this that our old man is
[59:48] crucified with him that the body of sin
[59:51] might be destroyed that henceforth we
[59:53] should not serve sin
[59:55] for he that is dead is freed from sin
[59:58] now if we be dead with Christ we believe
[1:00:00] that we should also live with him
[1:00:02] knowing that Christ being raised from
[1:00:04] the dead dieth no more death hath no
[1:00:06] more dominion over him friend that he
[1:00:09] died he died unto sin once but in that
[1:00:11] he liveth he liveth unto God verse 11.
[1:00:14] likewise reckon ye also yourselves to be
[1:00:17] dead indeed unto sin but alive unto God
[1:00:19] through Jesus our lord
[1:00:22] let no sin therefore reign in your
[1:00:24] mortal body that ye shall obey it in the
[1:00:26] lust thereof noises has given us a
[1:00:28] something to really think about let not
[1:00:30] sin therefore reign in your mortal body
[1:00:32] and all sin is what is unbelief
[1:00:36] see we could say sin is all these other
[1:00:38] things drinking gambling and smoking but
[1:00:40] but what is sin is really is unbelief
[1:00:43] you not believe in taking God at his
[1:00:44] word that's what sin really is neither
[1:00:47] yield your members look who's saying
[1:00:49] right here neither yield your members as
[1:00:51] instruments of unrighteousness Unto sin
[1:00:54] but yield yourselves unto God as those
[1:00:57] that are alive from the dead and your
[1:00:58] members are as instruments of
[1:01:00] righteousness unto God so we have a
[1:01:02] choice every day who we yield ourselves
[1:01:05] to
[1:01:06] it's either going to be God there's
[1:01:07] going to be Satan you may say well I'm a
[1:01:09] Christian you know I've been born again
[1:01:10] but you can still yield your instrument
[1:01:13] to the wrong thing at the wrong way how
[1:01:15] many times have you been uh looking at
[1:01:17] something and a wrong thing comes out or
[1:01:19] pops up or something or whatever or
[1:01:21] you're in a situation and you you kind
[1:01:23] of go off the handle a little bit was
[1:01:26] that God going off the handle or is
[1:01:28] that Satan getting in there that's right
[1:01:30] that's right so it's all right that you
[1:01:31] can yield yourself at any moment any
[1:01:33] time to the wrong instrument
[1:01:35] says for sin shall not have dominion
[1:01:38] over you for you're not under the law
[1:01:40] but under grace What then shall we sin
[1:01:42] because we're not under the law but
[1:01:43] under grace God forbid see Paul's not
[1:01:46] doing away with the law the law is still
[1:01:47] in in still intact today
[1:01:50] know ye not that to whom you yield
[1:01:51] yourselves servants to obey his servants
[1:01:56] you are to whom you obey whether of sin
[1:01:58] unto death or of obedience unto
[1:02:00] righteousness but God we think that you
[1:02:03] were Servants of sin but you have obeyed
[1:02:05] from the heart that from the doctrine
[1:02:07] which was delivered you being then made
[1:02:10] free from sin you become the Servants of
[1:02:12] righteousness I speak the manner of men
[1:02:15] because of infirmity of your flesh for
[1:02:17] as if you yielded your member servants
[1:02:19] to uncleanliness into iniquity unto
[1:02:21] iniquity even so now yield your members
[1:02:24] servants to unrighteousness unto
[1:02:26] holiness
[1:02:27] for when you are the Servants of sin you
[1:02:29] are free from righteousness wow that's
[1:02:31] deep what fruit had even in those things
[1:02:34] where of you are now ashamed for the end
[1:02:36] of those things as death
[1:02:38] but now being made free from sin and
[1:02:40] become servants to God you have your
[1:02:42] fruit unto Holiness in the end of
[1:02:45] everlasting life verse 23 for the wages
[1:02:48] of sin is death but the gift of God is
[1:02:51] eternal life through Jesus Christ Our
[1:02:53] Lord
[1:02:54] so we just see this we got to recognize
[1:02:57] this constant battle that's going within
[1:02:58] us and we're going to read that in
[1:02:59] Romans 7 here in a second we got to
[1:03:01] recognize that your spiritual man wants
[1:03:05] to do the things of God while your car
[1:03:07] your carnal man wants to do the things
[1:03:09] not of God and it's a constant War
[1:03:11] inside of us going to tug of war
[1:03:13] constantly just hitting at us and we see
[1:03:16] Paul is picking up where Paul is telling
[1:03:18] you about this inward battle says The
[1:03:20] Strife of the two Natures under the law
[1:03:23] for that which I do verse 15 chapter 7
[1:03:26] verse 15. for that which I do I allow
[1:03:29] not for what I would that do I not but
[1:03:31] what I hate that I do
[1:03:33] that that inward battle you want to do
[1:03:36] good but
[1:03:38] evil is trying to get you to constantly
[1:03:39] do this over here
[1:03:42] and you have to crucify that because if
[1:03:44] you don't crucify that then you're gonna
[1:03:46] go into default every time it's so easy
[1:03:48] to go into default because that's how
[1:03:50] the nature was you may say well Mark I'm
[1:03:52] born again but you're still in these
[1:03:53] fleshly bodies because Jesus didn't come
[1:03:55] to redeem these bodies but he came to
[1:03:58] redeem what's inside of here
[1:04:01] so we're still in a battle until he
[1:04:03] comes so if then I do that which I would
[1:04:06] not I consent to the law that is good
[1:04:08] now then there's no more I that do it
[1:04:10] but sin that door Within Me so verse 18.
[1:04:13] if I know that in me that's in my flesh
[1:04:16] dwarf no good thing so you have to
[1:04:18] recognize that
[1:04:19] your carnality your flesh there's
[1:04:22] nothing good in it
[1:04:23] and so you can't depend upon it to to
[1:04:26] help you to to help you get uh closer to
[1:04:29] prayer because it doesn't want to pray
[1:04:30] it hates to pray and if it does pray it
[1:04:34] wants to pray the bare minimum and wants
[1:04:36] to pray repetitiously
[1:04:38] for another enemy that's in my flesh
[1:04:40] worth no good thing
[1:04:41] for to will is present with me but how
[1:04:44] to perform that which is good I find not
[1:04:46] so you can't find to perform good inside
[1:04:49] your flesh yeah you could be a good
[1:04:50] person you know I can I can show you a
[1:04:53] lot of good people but God isn't just
[1:04:55] calling us to be good
[1:04:57] that's not enough because if that rich
[1:05:00] rung ruler
[1:05:01] then he was good enough but Jesus said
[1:05:04] you lack one thing and he was a man that
[1:05:07] followed the Commandments he's a man
[1:05:08] that probably gave to the poor but all
[1:05:11] that stuff doesn't matter
[1:05:12] if you don't know him personally
[1:05:15] for the good that I would I do not but
[1:05:18] the evil which I would not that I do
[1:05:20] now if I do that I would not there's no
[1:05:22] more I that do it but send that to
[1:05:24] offend me I find in a law that when I
[1:05:27] would do good evil was present with me
[1:05:30] so every time we try to get closer to
[1:05:32] Christ
[1:05:33] the enemy is trying to
[1:05:35] get us out the way trying to get us this
[1:05:37] a little bit off because he knows the
[1:05:40] closer we get to God
[1:05:42] he's going to be defeated every time
[1:05:44] that's why it's so important that he
[1:05:46] said 22 for I Delight in the law of God
[1:05:48] after the inward man
[1:05:51] you have to Delight
[1:05:52] for God after anywhere man you can't
[1:05:55] just be doing just alms and just doing
[1:05:57] it because you have to do it there's no
[1:05:59] life in that you'll be miserable
[1:06:01] you got to do it because you you want to
[1:06:03] know the author of this word
[1:06:05] but I see another law on my members
[1:06:07] warning against the law of my mind and
[1:06:10] bringing me into captivity to the law of
[1:06:12] sin which is in my members
[1:06:14] you got we got I love this honesty what
[1:06:16] Paul says oh Wretched Man that I am who
[1:06:18] shall deliver me from the body of this
[1:06:20] death
[1:06:21] I thank God through Jesus Christ Our
[1:06:23] Lord so with the mind I myself sort of
[1:06:25] the law of God but with the flesh the
[1:06:27] law of sin
[1:06:29] so when our Lord and savior died for us
[1:06:31] he gave us a way
[1:06:33] that we could fight
[1:06:36] but we got to yield ourselves to him
[1:06:38] because if we don't yield ourselves to
[1:06:41] him then we're never going to win the
[1:06:42] battle because the battle is the lord
[1:06:44] it's not yours you got to submit
[1:06:47] yourself to the Lord
[1:06:48] so he can give you the victory
[1:06:52] and it's not it's not a heart we make it
[1:06:55] so hard sometimes because we always want
[1:06:57] to be in control of the situation we
[1:06:59] don't want to let go so you got to let
[1:07:01] go and let God be God
[1:07:03] if not he can't you see we try to be God
[1:07:05] on a situation and every time it
[1:07:07] backfires in our face so just let go and
[1:07:10] let God be God who he is he knows what
[1:07:12] he's doing he eats out plans to prosper
[1:07:15] you and to give you an expected end
[1:07:18] but it also says seek seek him with all
[1:07:20] your heart that's just the key to seek
[1:07:23] him with everything that you have so
[1:07:26] like I said before work as we're
[1:07:28] constantly stepping towards Christ Our
[1:07:30] flesh is going to try to combat against
[1:07:32] what the our spirit man wants see the
[1:07:35] flesh always wants to be lazy it wants
[1:07:38] to be complacent it loves pleasure the
[1:07:41] fled the flesh loves to be entertained
[1:07:43] it loves to feel good things
[1:07:46] and and no the flesh knows it was
[1:07:49] doesn't it's not going to feel good
[1:07:51] if you're serving God with all your
[1:07:52] heart it's gonna It's Gonna Hate it's
[1:07:54] gonna rile up as much as it can it's
[1:07:56] gonna try to come up
[1:07:58] that's why you can see Paul said I
[1:08:00] crucify myself daily
[1:08:02] and so we'll go to Romans 8. and just
[1:08:04] really get a little deeper into that
[1:08:07] that spiritual warfare again look at
[1:08:09] verse 8 says verse one says in verse 8.
[1:08:11] there is therefore no condemnation to
[1:08:14] them which are in Christ Jesus who walk
[1:08:16] not after the flesh but what but after
[1:08:19] the spirit
[1:08:21] so you got to be walking after the
[1:08:23] spirit
[1:08:24] if there's going to be no condemnation
[1:08:28] verse 5 for they thereafter the flesh do
[1:08:30] mind the things of the flesh so that
[1:08:33] that black dog white dog there's a black
[1:08:35] dog inside even a white dog inside of
[1:08:37] you and whatever dog that you feed the
[1:08:39] most the white the white dogs are
[1:08:40] spiritual man and the black dogs are
[1:08:42] carnal man so whatever dog you feed the
[1:08:44] most is what's going to come out on top
[1:08:46] so if you decide to feed the black dog
[1:08:48] then guess what don't expect anything
[1:08:50] from God then because God can't work if
[1:08:52] you're feeding on the things that are
[1:08:54] not of him God can only work if you're
[1:08:56] feeding upon him as simple as that like
[1:08:59] a car if you don't feed your car with
[1:09:01] gas guess what it's not going to go
[1:09:03] simple as that if you don't pay your
[1:09:05] bills your electric bill guess what
[1:09:06] you're gonna not have electricity if you
[1:09:09] don't fill your refrigerator guess what
[1:09:10] you're gonna starve simple as that
[1:09:13] verse 6.
[1:09:15] for to be currently minded is death so
[1:09:17] scripture is telling us
[1:09:19] if we're constantly in carnality
[1:09:21] constantly disbelieving God's word then
[1:09:23] guess what's going to happen death
[1:09:25] but to be spiritually minded is life and
[1:09:27] peace how many want peace and life in
[1:09:29] their life
[1:09:30] then feed upon the things of God Amen
[1:09:33] Amen Let God just be who he is like we
[1:09:36] said before God is going to be God if we
[1:09:38] let him be God who's in control of the
[1:09:40] drivers who are you or God
[1:09:43] amen because the colonel mind is enmity
[1:09:45] against God for it's neither subject to
[1:09:48] the law of God neither indeed can be
[1:09:51] so then they that are in the flesh
[1:09:52] cannot please God so you can't even
[1:09:54] please God In the Flesh
[1:09:56] but you're not in the flesh but in the
[1:09:58] spirit if so be it the spirit of God
[1:10:01] dwelleth in you now if any man have not
[1:10:03] the spirit of Christ he is none of his
[1:10:05] and if Christ be in you the body is dead
[1:10:08] because of sin but the spirit is life
[1:10:11] because of righteousness amen let's go
[1:10:13] to verse um 12. therefore brethren we
[1:10:16] are we are debtors notice that not to
[1:10:18] the flesh to live after the flesh
[1:10:22] for if you live after the flesh ye shall
[1:10:24] die but if through the spirit do
[1:10:26] mortified the Deeds of the body ye shall
[1:10:29] live so as a constant a daily
[1:10:31] crucifixion that we must obtain
[1:10:35] because God is calling us to so much
[1:10:38] higher than what we think he's really
[1:10:40] calling us to
[1:10:41] true and we gotta make sure that we're
[1:10:44] constantly just mortifying the Deeds of
[1:10:46] the body
[1:10:48] because if not we can't live
[1:10:50] amen amen so we just see Paul just
[1:10:54] expounding the dangers of feeding the
[1:10:56] black dog and it's a choice that we have
[1:10:59] to make every day who are you going to
[1:11:01] feed today are you going to feed the
[1:11:03] spiritual man or you're going to feed
[1:11:04] the black dog and you make that decision
[1:11:06] the first thing you get up in the
[1:11:08] morning the decision is probably going
[1:11:09] to be made right then and there if you
[1:11:11] decide not to spend your time in prayer
[1:11:13] first thing in the morning there's a
[1:11:15] chance that your day is going to be the
[1:11:17] black dog's day
[1:11:19] is this the truth amen
[1:11:22] so it's nothing in the world but just
[1:11:24] having a gift to know how to relax
[1:11:25] myself
[1:11:26] get William Branham off to the side
[1:11:28] that's the biggest enemy I got is
[1:11:30] William Branham he's always in my way
[1:11:33] he's always in God's way I will say
[1:11:35] he's always gets in God's way he's too
[1:11:37] tired he don't want to do this he don't
[1:11:39] want to do that if I can just crucify
[1:11:42] that guy God can use it so if we can
[1:11:45] just deny ourself then God can use us
[1:11:48] God can answer those prayers we want to
[1:11:51] be answered God can do wonderful how
[1:11:54] many how many wants God do wonderful
[1:11:55] things in their life
[1:11:57] and keep crucifying keep praying keep
[1:12:00] seeking
[1:12:01] if it doesn't come right away Daniel
[1:12:03] played for 21 days straight right
[1:12:07] and God said I heard every prayer
[1:12:10] every prayer
[1:12:12] so we've got to have faith that God is
[1:12:14] hearing our prayers God knows your needs
[1:12:17] God knows you're struggling God knows
[1:12:18] you're in pain he knows you're weak he
[1:12:21] knows all these things
[1:12:22] but just believe that he hears every
[1:12:24] prayer he even hears the tears that
[1:12:26] don't make a sound when they fall on the
[1:12:28] ground
[1:12:28] sometimes we have this crowd to God Amen
[1:12:31] when I have words to say but this crowd
[1:12:33] to God say Lord the scripture even tells
[1:12:36] me I don't know how to pray
[1:12:37] but you said the spirit will give me
[1:12:39] utterance to say
[1:12:41] right and so we got sometimes sometimes
[1:12:44] I hit my knees and I don't know what to
[1:12:45] say sometimes I'm just like Lord I don't
[1:12:47] know what to say
[1:12:48] but it's okay
[1:12:50] he knows what you have needed before you
[1:12:52] even needed it
[1:12:53] and so let's go to verse 18. I love
[1:12:55] Verse 18 right here what it says
[1:12:57] for our reckon that the suffering of
[1:12:59] this present time we're not worthy to be
[1:13:01] compared with the glory which shall be
[1:13:03] revealed in us hallelujah I love that so
[1:13:07] the trials you're going through the
[1:13:08] trials you will go through they are not
[1:13:11] worthy to be compared to the glory which
[1:13:13] shall be revealed in us because those
[1:13:16] trials are leading you one step closer
[1:13:18] to that Glory it's going to be revealed
[1:13:20] in you that one step closer
[1:13:22] for the rapture
[1:13:24] so you got to believe the hardships
[1:13:25] you're going through they aren't by
[1:13:27] coincidence they're not
[1:13:29] but you gotta believe that Christ is
[1:13:32] with you through the darkest times even
[1:13:34] though it feels like he's not there I I
[1:13:36] job
[1:13:37] probably felt the same way but he knew
[1:13:39] that history he knew that that God was
[1:13:42] there because he didn't curse God not
[1:13:44] one time
[1:13:45] he didn't he knew God was faithful and
[1:13:48] he knew this trial that he had it
[1:13:51] probably felt like an eternity but he
[1:13:53] kept his eyes focused no matter what
[1:13:56] his friend said no matter what his wife
[1:13:58] said just imagine that his wife said
[1:14:00] Curse God and die
[1:14:02] his friend said Joe beer a secret sinner
[1:14:05] all these accusations that he had but he
[1:14:07] still kept the faith
[1:14:09] amen the faith
[1:14:11] amen
[1:14:13] amen
[1:14:14] praise God
[1:14:16] I used to preach over in the Baptist
[1:14:18] Church a little sermon I called it let
[1:14:20] let loose and let God that's right just
[1:14:22] let loose and let God as long as you got
[1:14:25] yourself into it there ain't no way you
[1:14:28] know the biggest enemy I got is William
[1:14:30] Branham he's always in God's way if I
[1:14:32] can just get him out the way then God
[1:14:34] can go to work that's your worst enemy
[1:14:36] is yourself just get yourself out the
[1:14:39] way then let God and go to work
[1:14:43] so we want to see things that's
[1:14:44] happening in our lives things that
[1:14:46] happen in our church
[1:14:48] then we gotta let's get out the way we
[1:14:50] want to live see
[1:14:52] we want to live a Victorious life but
[1:14:54] we're not willing to do what it takes to
[1:14:56] live a Victorious Life
[1:14:58] hey man let's go to
[1:15:00] Hebrews 3 14.
[1:15:02] amen
[1:15:04] and a man never knows what it is to live
[1:15:06] a Victorious life until he's completely
[1:15:07] overcome who himself
[1:15:10] I love that
[1:15:12] that's the biggest enemy you got that's
[1:15:14] the reason you can't rise up in faith
[1:15:16] because you got intellectuals there your
[1:15:19] intellectual part says well this or that
[1:15:21] it's a reasoning we got a cast down
[1:15:22] reasoning the Bible tells us
[1:15:25] so Hebrews 3 14.
[1:15:30] so if I'm running a race
[1:15:33] a relay race and I I'm running as hard
[1:15:36] as I can at the beginning
[1:15:37] and I'm I'm just like I'm beating
[1:15:39] everybody but then I start to slow down
[1:15:41] towards the end of the race and I lose
[1:15:44] did any of that matter of me running all
[1:15:46] I could at the beginning it doesn't
[1:15:47] because I didn't finish and so the same
[1:15:50] thing the writer in Hebrews is telling
[1:15:52] us Paul is saying in 314.
[1:15:57] for we are made partakers of Christ if
[1:16:01] if we hold the beginning of our
[1:16:04] confidence
[1:16:05] steadfast until the end
[1:16:08] so we got to hold that that same you
[1:16:10] know when you first give your heart to
[1:16:12] the Lord how happy you were how man you
[1:16:14] just Lord I want to do anything you tell
[1:16:15] me to do I don't care what it takes and
[1:16:17] then sometimes as we get a little
[1:16:19] seasoned Christians we kind of get a
[1:16:21] little lazy or I can you know I can kind
[1:16:23] of do this and not do that
[1:16:25] but the scripture says hold the
[1:16:27] beginning of our confidence steadfast
[1:16:29] unto the End Amen so if you want to make
[1:16:33] a Rapture if you want to live Victorious
[1:16:35] life if you want healing if you want
[1:16:37] keep doing ex we can keep on Kick The
[1:16:39] List you got to hold your confidence
[1:16:41] steadfast Until the End keep that Faith
[1:16:44] you gotta earnestly contend for the
[1:16:45] faith that was once delivered to the
[1:16:47] Saints and it's still being delivered to
[1:16:49] the Saints but you gotta earnestly
[1:16:50] contend for it you gotta believe that
[1:16:53] it's for you and the word is calling us
[1:16:56] to be Overcomers amen it says in
[1:16:58] Revelations 3 21
[1:17:03] to him that overcometh will I grant to
[1:17:06] sit with me in my throne even as I
[1:17:09] alsoever came and sat down with my
[1:17:11] father in his throne so we're serving
[1:17:14] the lord and savior that knows how to
[1:17:15] overcome
[1:17:16] and it's not you necessarily doing the
[1:17:18] overcoming but it's you're letting the
[1:17:20] Overcomer give you the overcoming power
[1:17:22] you need to overcome the situation
[1:17:25] because you can't overcome any situation
[1:17:27] by yourself
[1:17:29] you got to let the Overcomer do what the
[1:17:32] Overcomer does simple as that
[1:17:35] and you may think well this situation is
[1:17:37] so hard
[1:17:38] it may be hard to the carnal mind
[1:17:41] but the spiritual man doesn't look at
[1:17:43] the situation he looks at what God's
[1:17:45] word says I don't think that God can I
[1:17:47] know he will that's how the spirit man
[1:17:49] looks you got to believe that that if
[1:17:51] God's if somebody else met the same
[1:17:53] condition in God's word then God is
[1:17:56] obligated to fulfill that same word in
[1:17:58] your life if you meet every condition
[1:18:00] he's obligated he has to because he
[1:18:03] can't lie
[1:18:04] so we just see that says he that hath an
[1:18:07] ear let him hear what the spirit says
[1:18:08] unto the churches amen so we see also in
[1:18:12] 21 6
[1:18:19] amen and he said unto me it is done I am
[1:18:22] the Alpha and Omega the beginning and
[1:18:24] the end
[1:18:25] I will give unto him that is a thirst
[1:18:28] of the Fountain of the Water of Life
[1:18:30] freely so whoever is a thirst he's
[1:18:33] giving you an invitation to drink from
[1:18:35] that Fountain of Life freely
[1:18:37] but you have to accept that invitation
[1:18:40] you heard a statement of Partners on a
[1:18:42] pardon list received as a pardon so you
[1:18:44] have to accept that invitation that he's
[1:18:47] calling you to drink from the Water of
[1:18:49] Life freely
[1:18:50] look at verse 7 says he that overcometh
[1:18:53] shall inherit all things
[1:18:57] and I will be his God and he shall be my
[1:18:59] son
[1:19:00] she got to believe that God is calling
[1:19:02] you to be an overcomer he called David
[1:19:04] to be an overcomer one day against the
[1:19:07] lion the bear and Goliath
[1:19:09] and so there may be Goliath in our lives
[1:19:11] right now but you gotta believe
[1:19:13] that you can overcome this Goliath in
[1:19:16] your life
[1:19:16] you got to take the slingshot of faith
[1:19:19] and hit him right in the eye
[1:19:21] and you got to overcome any and
[1:19:23] everything in your life God has called
[1:19:25] you to overcome it even the children of
[1:19:27] Israel they thought they couldn't
[1:19:28] overcome but there was two Believers
[1:19:30] that knew they could overcome how many
[1:19:32] is Joshua and Caleb's here today
[1:19:34] amen amen well if you're Joshua and
[1:19:36] Caleb's and you're called to be
[1:19:37] Overcomers because they were called to
[1:19:39] be Overcomers in their age and every age
[1:19:41] God has called Overcomers and it's no
[1:19:44] different in this age that I believe all
[1:19:46] of us can be Overcomers no matter the
[1:19:49] situation in our lives you got to just
[1:19:51] trust in this word
[1:19:53] it's the blueprint it's your ticket out
[1:19:55] of here it's your ticket for every
[1:19:57] situation in your life you gotta hold to
[1:20:00] the word cleave to it love the word eat
[1:20:03] the word
[1:20:05] amen amen and so another thing the word
[1:20:07] is called us to be is fruitful how many
[1:20:09] believe that
[1:20:10] God expects fruit to be bore out of our
[1:20:12] Lives see we're not here just by
[1:20:15] coincidence just to be good Christians
[1:20:17] but we're here to manifest fruit and we
[1:20:21] see in John 15.
[1:20:23] how to manifest that fruit
[1:20:27] in order to manifest you got to be
[1:20:28] connected to something right
[1:20:31] and we got to be connected to the Vine
[1:20:34] so he says Jesus says right here I am
[1:20:36] the Vine
[1:20:38] good verse four abide in me and I in you
[1:20:42] so in order for him to abide and you
[1:20:43] gotta abide in him first as the branch
[1:20:46] cannot bear fruit of itself except it
[1:20:48] abide in the vine no more Kenny except
[1:20:50] you abide in me
[1:20:51] I am the Vine
[1:20:53] ye are the branches he that abideth in
[1:20:55] me and I in him the same
[1:20:58] bringeth forth much fruit
[1:21:01] for without me you can do nothing
[1:21:05] if a man abide not in me he is cast
[1:21:07] forth as a branch and is withered and
[1:21:09] and get and Men gather them and cast
[1:21:11] them into the fire they are burned
[1:21:13] so if you want fruit in your life you
[1:21:15] got to abide in Christ you have to you
[1:21:18] have to you have to if you want to
[1:21:19] change in your life you got to abide in
[1:21:22] Jesus Christ if you're in a situation
[1:21:24] resolved the right way you got to abide
[1:21:27] in Christ you know as I said the right
[1:21:28] way because you can try to resolve a
[1:21:30] situation but it's going to create more
[1:21:31] problems it's not resolving but if you
[1:21:34] want to revolve the situation the right
[1:21:36] way abide in Christ amen
[1:21:38] Amen in this race
[1:21:41] you're running against your carnal flesh
[1:21:43] right I'm running against Mark Cosby
[1:21:45] you're running against brother John
[1:21:46] Brother Joseph brother Jonathan sister
[1:21:48] Gabriel I want to say everybody's names
[1:21:49] but everybody will run against ourselves
[1:21:51] amen
[1:21:53] amen and the only thing that's going to
[1:21:54] stop you from winning this race
[1:21:57] is if you don't crucify yourself
[1:21:59] your flesh daily Your Lust in your
[1:22:01] desires because they will your lusting
[1:22:03] your desires will always always get you
[1:22:05] sidetracked from the perfect will of God
[1:22:07] because your lust and desires wants to
[1:22:10] take some of God's Will and put some of
[1:22:12] his will together and try to combine it
[1:22:14] and the Flesh in the word can't mix
[1:22:16] because they're they're night and day
[1:22:18] their enmity their enmity against each
[1:22:20] other let's go to Second Timothy
[1:22:23] 19 time just flies huh
[1:22:25] second Timothy I feel how brother John
[1:22:27] feels second Timothy two
[1:22:31] verse 19-21 we're almost done
[1:22:36] amen
[1:22:38] nevertheless the foundation of God stand
[1:22:41] at the shirt how many can say Amen to
[1:22:42] that amen having this sealed the Lord
[1:22:45] knoweth them that are his and that
[1:22:47] everyone that nameth of Christ apart
[1:22:51] from iniquity
[1:22:52] but in a great house there are not only
[1:22:54] vessels of gold and of silver but also
[1:22:56] wooden of Earth and some to it honor and
[1:22:58] some to dishonor
[1:23:01] If any man therefore Purge himself look
[1:23:04] notice that
[1:23:05] Purge himself so you got to do something
[1:23:08] it's not just you lay down and God just
[1:23:10] does it all but you got to do something
[1:23:12] you draw night of God what he'll draw an
[1:23:14] eye to you even even talks about in that
[1:23:17] scripture cleanse yourself Sinners
[1:23:18] purify your hands so it's given
[1:23:20] something that you need to do as well
[1:23:23] amen he shall if therefore Purge himself
[1:23:26] from these he shall be a vessel unto
[1:23:28] honor Sanctified and met for the Masters
[1:23:31] use notice that for the Master's use God
[1:23:35] wants to use you yes
[1:23:37] but you have to purge yourself you have
[1:23:39] to be willing to let go of your plans
[1:23:41] your hopes your dreams and let God's
[1:23:45] plans be
[1:23:47] the plans for your life because now
[1:23:49] every single plan you make is going to
[1:23:51] be what God wants for your life I'm
[1:23:53] sorry to say but it's just like that
[1:23:55] and you gotta you gotta just be able to
[1:23:57] cope be able to just take that and say
[1:24:00] Lord I'm okay with that because I know
[1:24:02] the way you're gonna Lead Me is going to
[1:24:04] lead to life it's going to lead to fruit
[1:24:06] it's going to lead to overcoming
[1:24:09] 22. flee also youthful lust notice that
[1:24:14] follow but follow after righteousness
[1:24:17] Faith charity and peace with them that
[1:24:21] call on the Lord out of a
[1:24:23] Pure Heart
[1:24:25] not a a a a wicked heart not a I'm gonna
[1:24:29] halfway give my heart to you and halfway
[1:24:31] not but a pure heart so you got a call
[1:24:33] on the Lord with a pure heart you can't
[1:24:35] say Lord I'm gonna try to serve you and
[1:24:37] serve maim at the same time but you say
[1:24:39] Lord
[1:24:40] I need you please just come and take
[1:24:43] control of the situation because I've
[1:24:45] made such a mess out of it and Lord I'm
[1:24:47] tired I'm tired of doing things my way
[1:24:49] I'm gonna do it your way from now on
[1:24:51] amen
[1:24:53] amen
[1:24:55] a couple more quotes and I'll close
[1:24:57] and then a man that ever comes to God
[1:24:59] and really down in his heart finds a
[1:25:01] settled faith
[1:25:03] it'll stand good in the mouth of death
[1:25:05] amen or in the mouth of sickness or in
[1:25:07] the mouth of Sorrow it'll stand good for
[1:25:09] faith is a victory you have overcome by
[1:25:12] your faith
[1:25:15] amen
[1:25:17] amen to the church from place to place
[1:25:20] just near
[1:25:25] only you can't purpose anything of God's
[1:25:27] promise in your heart without finding
[1:25:29] the reality to it if your soul has been
[1:25:31] tormented by sins and doubts and ups and
[1:25:34] downs and frustrations there's something
[1:25:36] down in thee that's telling you there's
[1:25:38] somewhere you can overcome that I love
[1:25:40] that
[1:25:41] why do you float around from church to
[1:25:43] church to from place to place just kneel
[1:25:45] down
[1:25:46] till you strike heaven
[1:25:48] so if there's ups and downs in your life
[1:25:50] doubts
[1:25:52] kneel down and just meet with God you
[1:25:54] know that song just have a little talk
[1:25:56] with Jesus and everything is going to be
[1:25:57] all right it works trust me
[1:26:01] as I said last night go beyond the sound
[1:26:03] barriers then you'll have purpose in
[1:26:05] life you have a purpose in belonging to
[1:26:07] the church amen you have a purpose in
[1:26:10] being baptized you have a purpose in
[1:26:12] what God and what you're seeking for
[1:26:14] because we know that God is honest God
[1:26:17] is true and God cannot lie
[1:26:20] and if God placed that into Abraham's
[1:26:22] Heart by his voice his word then God has
[1:26:25] placed in before us in his Bible and by
[1:26:29] the witness of the Holy Ghost by
[1:26:31] returning of the Holy Spirit and signs
[1:26:33] and wonders that Jesus Christ still
[1:26:35] lives and he's the same yesterday today
[1:26:37] and forever then why would we seek any
[1:26:39] longer after those things that we desire
[1:26:43] so this in closing
[1:26:45] we got to keep our Focus
[1:26:47] our Focus has to be kept on Christ
[1:26:50] if it's not kept on Christ then you are
[1:26:52] living below what God is calling you to
[1:26:55] live below so we live a million miles
[1:26:57] below our privilege because we lose
[1:26:58] focus all the time we ought to
[1:27:00] constantly pinch our conscience
[1:27:02] and say focused on Christ amen because
[1:27:06] Christ is the goal of our life
[1:27:08] we're going to be just like him the
[1:27:10] Bible says in order to be like him you
[1:27:12] got to be focused on him
[1:27:14] Elijah was Elisha was always hard to say
[1:27:17] in those words Elisha was focused on
[1:27:19] Elijah
[1:27:20] he didn't take his eyes off him he
[1:27:22] followed him everywhere he went
[1:27:24] and we gotta be the same thing with
[1:27:25] Christ keep our eyes on wherever we go
[1:27:27] our eyes with them every we go connected
[1:27:29] because the more we're connected with
[1:27:30] him
[1:27:31] the more that we can live a Victorious
[1:27:34] Life faith is our Victory how many can
[1:27:36] say Amen to that
[1:27:38] we just rise and we'll invite sister
[1:27:40] Cheryl
[1:27:42] we're just saying um when she comes is
[1:27:44] turn Our Eyes Upon Jesus
[1:27:53] amen how many love him tonight
[1:27:55] amen how many want to keep their eyes on
[1:27:58] them no matter what
[1:28:01] amen
[1:28:08] thank you Jesus
[1:28:12] [Music]
[1:28:14] Turn Your Eyes Upon Jesus
[1:28:30] and the things over will go strangely
[1:28:37] dead in the light of his glory and grace
[1:28:44] [Music]
[1:28:48] turn your
[1:28:50] Your Eyes Upon
[1:28:52] Jesus
[1:28:54] look full it is wonderful faith
[1:29:02] and the things
[1:29:05] [Music]
[1:29:16] she continues to play it soft list by
[1:29:18] our heads it's a word of Prayer oh
[1:29:21] Heavenly Father
[1:29:22] we thank you Lord for this moment Lord
[1:29:25] I know I can say Lord many times I've
[1:29:28] taken my eyes off for you and I even
[1:29:29] realize it Lord father I pray you
[1:29:32] forgive us Lord for just taking our eyes
