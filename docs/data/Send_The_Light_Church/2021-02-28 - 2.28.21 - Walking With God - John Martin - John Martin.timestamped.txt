[32:49] very urgent
[32:52] lord we pray that the god of miracles
[32:55] would move
[32:56] upon many of these requests lord all
[33:00] over the world
[33:01] we thank you give you praise and honor
[33:03] for this for we ask it all in jesus
[33:05] christ's name
[33:06] amen god bless you may be seated
[33:11] before we start this
[33:15] the ministry of the word there was just
[33:17] a couple
[33:18] things that we wanted to share
[33:22] one was we have
[33:25] 11 open spots
[33:28] on the church cleaning sheet
[33:33] and so we're looking for 11 volunteers
[33:39] what do you mean we don't have that many
[33:41] people in our church
[33:44] so um i'd like to
[33:48] encourage uh
[33:52] to work for the lord
[33:56] i would say
[33:59] i mean you could do it unto the church i
[34:00] believe it'd be a blessing
[34:04] you know how it is when you want to do
[34:05] something for somebody
[34:08] but when you do it unto the lord you
[34:11] just don't lose your blessing
[34:13] no matter how you feel so
[34:17] uh we want to encourage that and then we
[34:20] have some
[34:21] missionary pictures from brother from
[34:24] brother
[34:25] boaz we'd like to show you now there
[34:27] were 13 souls that got baptized
[34:30] in cam reddy india and he
[34:33] distributed many uh bibles and message
[34:36] books and his
[34:37] most of you know that we are a supporter
[34:41] of our our brother amen so we're just
[34:44] going to go through these kind of quick
[34:48] like real quick
[34:54] because there's like there's many
[34:56] actually we're just going to show
[34:57] some isn't this beautiful
[35:36] we appreciate
[35:39] the lord using our brother to to be
[35:42] fishers of men
[35:48] one just one of those is worth ten
[35:51] thousand worlds
[35:57] this is the real beauty right here
[36:00] a soul
[36:05] our our church is so much nicer than
[36:07] that church right there
[36:10] but the beauty of the church is the
[36:12] character of the people
[36:29] amen praise the lord
[36:32] how many is excited god is still alive
[36:37] amen well
[36:40] one more thing i wanted to say about
[36:42] church order
[36:44] there have been improvements in our
[36:47] church
[36:48] how many can say praise the lord there's
[36:50] been some
[36:51] real improvements i've seen them i'm so
[36:54] grateful to the lord
[36:56] but there's still some areas that we
[36:58] need to keep pressing into because
[37:00] i'm going to be honest with you bad
[37:03] habits are hard to break
[37:06] but god deserves a greater reverence and
[37:09] that's
[37:10] that i want that to be the the focus or
[37:12] the motive
[37:14] um the first one that i have i just have
[37:16] three i want to touch
[37:18] uh getting to service
[37:21] i think is probably the most important
[37:23] one there's too many absences i believe
[37:25] god wants us to be
[37:26] more faithful he said well done thou
[37:29] good and faithful servant so
[37:30] faithfulness is important
[37:33] number two would be a lack of
[37:34] preparation
[37:37] i believe this is all part of the order
[37:39] either
[37:40] not getting to church on time or we're
[37:43] talking too much or just not praying
[37:45] enough either way
[37:46] there's a lack of preparation this is
[37:48] all part of order
[37:50] it's just part of order and then three
[37:53] is
[37:53] once church has started let's
[37:57] give god more reverence one church once
[38:00] church has started god is talking
[38:04] so stay seated my god can you imagine
[38:06] you're talking this time you have an
[38:08] interview with somebody
[38:09] and you just get up and walk away
[38:12] you know so when god's talking stay
[38:14] seated
[38:15] don't get up leave while god's speaking
[38:17] to you
[38:19] and i want to say when god is speaking
[38:22] to just sit there and say nothing the
[38:23] whole service
[38:24] by god's speaking to you
[38:33] i just don't think that's the lord
[38:37] brother graham told us that the holy
[38:39] ghost says amen to every word of god
[38:41] right now i'm not saying that we got to
[38:43] say it out loud but what i am saying is
[38:45] that you need to get involved with what
[38:47] god's speaking to you
[38:50] now to say more than so be it or amen
[38:55] we could be robbing god of attention
[39:02] because god is is got your attention
[39:04] he's trying to speak to you you just
[39:06] want to agree with the word
[39:08] so just reverently agree with the word
[39:13] and then respond to the word respond
[39:15] come
[39:16] come pray come seek the lord and or
[39:19] maybe stay in your seats and pray but
[39:21] just get real with god
[39:23] amen because that's what that's what
[39:25] this is all about amen amen
[39:31] well this morning we want to start with
[39:34] a little series walking with god
[39:36] and here starting off
[39:40] the bat jesus makes a call to follow me
[39:44] and i'll make you fishers of men but we
[39:46] know that there's
[39:47] more to to following god than just
[39:51] winning souls
[40:02] but what does it really take to follow
[40:04] the lord
[40:05] matthew chapter 16 verse 24 jesus said
[40:08] unto his disciples if any man come after
[40:10] me
[40:12] let him deny himself take up his cross
[40:14] and follow me so these
[40:17] peter and his brother andrew
[40:20] um had when they when they made the
[40:23] decision to follow the lord
[40:25] to be a fisher of men they may have not
[40:28] known
[40:28] completely that they had to deny
[40:32] himself deny themselves and take up a
[40:35] cross
[40:36] but it was a requirement it wasn't just
[40:40] for certain people now for whosoever
[40:43] will save his life shall lose it
[40:45] and whosoever loses his life for my sake
[40:47] shall find it
[40:49] so if we if we make the choice not to
[40:52] follow the lord
[40:54] and we're because we're afraid to give
[40:56] up our will at the end we're going to
[40:58] lose it anyways
[41:01] and the thing is uh he says what what a
[41:04] man prophet if he gained everything that
[41:06] he could possibly want in this world
[41:08] and lose his soul and then he says it
[41:10] like this or what
[41:11] shall a man give in exchange for his
[41:13] soul
[41:14] what are you going to consider that's so
[41:16] much better than god's perfect will for
[41:18] your life
[41:21] in john chapter 16 verse 12 i have yet
[41:24] many things to say unto you but
[41:26] uh but you can't bear them now albeit
[41:28] when the spirit of truth has come
[41:30] he will guide you into walking with me
[41:34] into all truth amen so we're talking
[41:37] about following jesus today
[41:41] for he will not speak of himself now
[41:43] notice
[41:44] a spirit that's always is all about them
[41:47] all about them all about them how can
[41:50] that be the lord
[41:52] he's not speaking of himself
[41:58] jesus it wasn't about himself you have
[42:02] to deny the self
[42:04] it's about the purpose that god has
[42:09] absolutely for whatsoever he shall hear
[42:13] that shall he speak and he will show
[42:14] them things to come
[42:17] romans chapter 8 verse 14 just laying
[42:19] the foundation before we get into this
[42:21] romans chapter 8
[42:22] verse 14 for as many as are led by the
[42:25] spirit of god they are the sons of god
[42:27] yes
[42:27] amen now notice it doesn't say
[42:30] they are sons of god are led by the
[42:32] spirit of god
[42:37] because we've heard that
[42:41] even when we were in sin we were still
[42:42] son of god
[42:45] and i know i wasn't being led by god the
[42:47] things i was doing
[42:51] so god lays claim
[42:56] as you're taking up his leadership now
[42:58] there's many things that he has to
[43:00] to say unto you to lead you with
[43:06] but it's up to us whether we're going to
[43:08] follow them or not
[43:10] jesus said my sheep my
[43:13] sheep hear my voice what do they do
[43:16] they follow whatever he says they follow
[43:20] that's right so if we're a son and
[43:22] daughter of god
[43:23] and and we're we're in tune with the
[43:26] spirit we're going to follow what he
[43:28] said
[43:28] and it's not going to be easy it's going
[43:30] to hurt
[43:33] because to the flesh we can't bear it
[43:36] now we actually need something about to
[43:38] bear this and it's the holy ghost
[43:42] and it helps us to bear the will of the
[43:43] lord amen
[43:45] so where are we following jesus too
[43:50] we could say that we're following jesus
[43:52] to win souls and we'd be right
[43:55] we could say we're following him uh to
[43:57] heaven and that would be right but one
[43:59] thing i would like to us to focus on
[44:02] is that we're following jesus to get
[44:05] prepared for heaven because
[44:08] as brother branham taught us that that
[44:10] we as
[44:11] people have this tendency to to look at
[44:14] a god
[44:15] in what he's done in the past and a god
[44:18] to what he's going to do in the future
[44:19] and missing god what he's doing right
[44:21] now and i believe
[44:22] that god is preparing us
[44:25] for the catching away
[44:28] he said in matthew chapter 7 verse 13
[44:30] entering at the straight gate
[44:33] the straight gate he wants us to enter
[44:35] into verse 14 because strait is the gate
[44:38] and narrows the way
[44:38] which leadeth unto life and few be that
[44:42] find it notice
[44:43] the the gate in the way is leading us
[44:47] to life in other words we don't
[44:51] enter into it and then we're there right
[44:53] it's true we just know repent get
[44:55] baptized and we're there
[44:57] no we've entered into the way now we're
[44:59] in the way and we're heading there
[45:01] he that endured to the end the same
[45:03] shall be saved so there's a there's a
[45:04] path for us to fall to get there
[45:09] this morning i want to take a look at
[45:10] predestination
[45:14] and we'll take a look at working out our
[45:16] predestination
[45:19] it's true that every seed will bring
[45:21] forth of its own kind
[45:22] but satan is deceiving the whole world
[45:24] many will come to me in that day and say
[45:26] lord lord
[45:26] i thought it was predestinated i did all
[45:29] this and i thought it was
[45:31] the bible says that satan is deceiving
[45:33] the whole world we can see that out
[45:34] there naturally
[45:37] but spiritually amen
[45:41] we need to look at predestination just
[45:44] the way that we're told to look at
[45:46] salvation
[45:47] which is to work it out with fear and
[45:49] trembling
[45:51] not with an attitude of i'm saved i
[45:54] don't have to do anything
[45:55] breed us not to do anything
[45:57] [Music]
[45:59] and third i want to look at being
[46:00] conformed to christ
[46:03] being conformed to christ so taking our
[46:05] scripture here from romans chapter 8
[46:06] verse 29
[46:09] which was going to be my opening
[46:10] scripture amen
[46:12] for whom he did for no he also
[46:16] did predestinate
[46:19] to be conformed
[46:24] to the image of his son that he might be
[46:26] the firstborn
[46:28] among many brother now if anybody's got
[46:31] a brother
[46:32] that was born of the same parents
[46:37] there's no question and no doubt
[46:40] that your brothers
[46:44] and when we become born again
[46:48] and come into the image of christ we are
[46:51] a brother
[46:55] we are a brother we're joint heirs with
[46:57] christ the bible
[46:58] says now that word conform means jointly
[47:02] formed similar
[47:05] so we're not a tag-along we don't just
[47:08] belong to the church of god
[47:10] uh we are in god's image
[47:13] brother branham said in the message
[47:15] where i think pentecost failed he said
[47:17] predestinated
[47:20] it's not a very good word for an
[47:22] evangelist or a minister to use
[47:26] i feel okay because i'm a pastor
[47:29] because it confuses the people when you
[47:32] say predestination
[47:34] and we know where all confusion comes
[47:36] from we know where it originates from
[47:38] so satan loves to confuse the people
[47:40] with god's word
[47:44] so why does it confuse the people
[47:46] because satan can take the word
[47:48] and manipulate it in your mind in a
[47:51] number of different
[47:52] ways in one way satan wants people to
[47:55] feel
[47:56] like they're forced into a certain
[47:58] situation
[47:59] what i mean is well i must
[48:03] the way i feel i must be predestined to
[48:05] go to hell
[48:08] it's true you're pre you're going there
[48:11] this is the way you feel
[48:12] you can't change what you're doing he
[48:15] wants
[48:16] to force people like they're they're
[48:19] going in a certain direction
[48:21] but brother brandon said in the message
[48:23] the power of god speaking on
[48:24] predestination he said
[48:26] but god not making set it in order
[48:29] a little hole that you have to go
[48:32] through and you can't go
[48:34] no other way
[48:38] god never made it to where you have to
[48:42] you know you ever you push stuff through
[48:45] a little
[48:45] thing and you're making noodles or some
[48:48] sort of icing for a cake and you're
[48:49] pushing it through
[48:50] and it god never just chose
[48:54] us to be forced to go one way or the
[48:56] other way
[49:01] he said in other words god didn't say
[49:05] now i'll make this man this and i'll
[49:07] make this
[49:08] man to be that but in order to be god
[49:12] he had to know the end from the
[49:14] beginning
[49:16] brother and said foreknowledge is a
[49:18] better word to use
[49:21] because of god being omniscient
[49:24] or all-knowing by his great
[49:27] foreknowledge god
[49:29] knew what decision you were going to
[49:31] make before you were
[49:32] even aware of being that there was a god
[49:38] and that should give us confidence that
[49:40] god knows what we're going through
[49:42] knows our situations that he is a high
[49:46] priest that can be touched
[49:47] by the feelings of our infirmities that
[49:49] he's able to make a way where there
[49:51] seems to be no
[49:52] he knows all about it amen
[49:57] so one way god uses predestination to
[49:59] make people feel
[50:00] trapped in their minds that they have no
[50:02] choice in the matter
[50:04] but another way that satan uses
[50:06] predestination
[50:07] is to make people feel so free in their
[50:09] minds that no matter what they're still
[50:11] going
[50:16] it doesn't matter how much you miss
[50:18] church
[50:20] doesn't matter if you don't pay your
[50:21] tithes it's okay
[50:24] it's okay to rob god doesn't matter if
[50:27] you don't worship the lord in spirit and
[50:29] truth as long as you're there
[50:31] it doesn't matter if you don't love
[50:33] everyone
[50:35] it's okay if you could if you talk
[50:37] behind people's back i'm still
[50:39] predestinated
[50:42] if satan doesn't use the word to trap
[50:45] you out
[50:45] he'll use the word to relax you in
[50:47] laodicea amen
[50:49] that's why the word is dangerous
[50:54] i want us to look at predestination in a
[50:56] way of foreknowledge god really knows
[50:59] what's going on in your life god really
[51:02] knows what you're
[51:02] you're doing with your decision making
[51:06] where you're putting your your your your
[51:08] direction to it
[51:10] in life
[51:13] if you notice predestination didn't make
[51:15] paul
[51:16] relax it didn't make brother branham
[51:20] lazy
[51:21] it didn't make any of his disciples to
[51:23] lay back
[51:26] so predestination shouldn't alter your
[51:28] state
[51:33] and that's what satan wants to do he
[51:34] wants us to to alter our way as long as
[51:37] i'm in the message as long as i believe
[51:39] the prophet as long as this is that
[51:41] whatever
[51:45] by god's great foreknowledge he saw
[51:47] before the foundational world that
[51:50] you were given the opportunity to serve
[51:53] him
[51:54] and that when you were given that
[51:56] opportunity to serve him
[51:57] he knew you would say yes i'm going to
[52:00] serve you lord
[52:03] so buy that he could elect you
[52:07] right he could choose you
[52:10] and say yes when that time comes and i
[52:13] make that call
[52:14] and i say follow me we'll drop our nuts
[52:17] and follow the lord
[52:18] amen amen
[52:22] because of that decision that commitment
[52:25] he could predestines to become in the
[52:28] image of his son
[52:30] let's take a look at jacob and esau for
[52:33] just a moment
[52:35] esau was born first
[52:40] according to the right he had the
[52:43] birthright
[52:44] or the right to the promise of being the
[52:47] firstborn
[52:50] so all the way up to the day that that
[52:53] his daddy prayed over him
[52:57] um the very promise of the firstborn
[53:02] he believed he was predestinated to it
[53:05] his whole life he believed he was
[53:07] predestinated
[53:09] because he was the firstborn
[53:12] but he had a lax attitude amen
[53:17] he kind of despised doing the things
[53:19] that
[53:20] he was supposed to do
[53:23] i say today we don't want to despise
[53:26] when god's trying to lead us
[53:28] to do his will we don't want to despise
[53:30] that because that's what esau did
[53:39] now jacob was not the firstborn
[53:43] but he longed to possess the birthright
[53:48] and he had a desire at all cost to get
[53:50] the promise
[53:51] of the firstborn like those believers
[53:56] who sell out to become born again
[54:00] praise the lord willing to give up
[54:02] everything
[54:03] amen that's what it takes
[54:06] go to extremes yes jacob went to
[54:10] extremes
[54:16] he was a little trickery guy
[54:20] but he wanted that birthright
[54:24] praise god for a mother that has a
[54:26] revelation from heaven because
[54:28] daddy didn't have it now daddy now i'm
[54:30] going to just say keep saying daddy but
[54:32] we are the children of abraham isaac and
[54:34] jacob
[54:36] amen now the thing is isaac didn't have
[54:39] a proper revelation
[54:41] of his two sons
[54:44] his whole life right to the end
[54:49] that's why we can't just walk around
[54:51] with this thought process
[54:53] of unpredicting i feel real comfortable
[54:55] in life
[54:56] we gotta work it out with fear and
[54:58] trembling we gotta be sure
[55:04] jacob worked out his salvation with fear
[55:06] and trembling
[55:07] esau didn't esau
[55:11] enjoyed the pleasures of doing what he
[55:13] wanted to do
[55:16] but because of god's grateful knowledge
[55:19] of their decision making
[55:20] he could say without respect to persons
[55:23] jacob have i loved
[55:25] in esau have i hated
[55:31] before they were even born because of
[55:34] his foreknowledge
[55:35] i want you to understand this god for
[55:38] knew you and i today
[55:39] yes amen god is looking to us
[55:43] to stay the path to keep going from the
[55:46] decision that we made to follow him with
[55:48] all of our heart we can't let anything
[55:50] in this world
[55:51] take us off the track
[55:55] church attendance won't get us into a
[55:57] rapture
[56:00] neither a lack of it will
[56:04] we got to get serious with god amen
[56:07] romans chapter 11 verse 2 says god have
[56:10] not
[56:11] cast away his people which he for
[56:14] knew which he foreknew
[56:18] so when you look at the decision you
[56:20] made to follow christ and to sell out to
[56:22] become him
[56:23] because that's what we're to become is
[56:25] him make sure you're not despising
[56:28] the things that god is asking you to do
[56:30] today yes
[56:32] amen
[56:36] because the attitude that esau had was
[56:39] i'm still the firstborn
[56:44] even my daddy agrees with it he's even
[56:48] put his arm around me and says you're
[56:49] the firstborn
[56:52] but yet he despised the things that
[56:56] he was supposed to do
[56:59] and we all of us sitting here today are
[57:02] told by god almighty
[57:04] to do things don't despise it in your
[57:08] heart
[57:09] say god i want to do it i'm going to
[57:11] submit to you
[57:12] i'm going to deny this flesh i'm going
[57:14] to follow you to the end
[57:16] amen amen
[57:20] work out those things with fear and
[57:22] trembling amen
[57:24] for whom he did for no he also did
[57:27] predestinate
[57:29] to be conformed to the image of his son
[57:31] that
[57:32] he might be the firstborn among many
[57:34] brethren
[57:35] amen now is paul saying here that we're
[57:38] going to somehow magically be changed
[57:40] into the image
[57:41] of christ
[57:45] is it going to happen in the just a
[57:46] twinkling of an eye
[57:50] when we become new creatures in christ
[57:51] do all things automatically become
[57:53] new on their own
[57:56] what is he saying here paul is telling
[57:58] us in romans chapter 8
[58:00] that we are predestined to be jointly
[58:03] formed into his
[58:04] image but in romans 12 paul tells us
[58:08] to work at work out this predestination
[58:12] in a way in other words we have
[58:16] something to do about it
[58:19] if we don't have anything to do about
[58:20] then that means god does not go through
[58:22] free more agency
[58:24] and he has robots
[58:32] romans chapter 12 verse 1 i beseech you
[58:34] therefore brother by the mercies of god
[58:36] that you present your bodies
[58:37] a living sacrifice just present yourself
[58:40] to god
[58:41] in church here i am lord say it like it
[58:44] is
[58:46] holy acceptable unto god which is your
[58:49] reasonable service
[58:50] and be not conformed to this world
[58:55] that word conform it means different
[58:57] than what
[58:58] it does in 829 it means to fashion
[59:02] yourself amen
[59:04] we don't want to fashion ourselves just
[59:07] like
[59:07] how the world feels about church how it
[59:10] feels about god's word
[59:11] how it feels i mean you've got churches
[59:14] out there of course
[59:15] we know that every church does not like
[59:16] our church
[59:19] we got churches out there you however
[59:22] you feel
[59:23] whatever you want you can go get it's
[59:24] like a smorgasbord you can find what
[59:26] you're looking for
[59:33] but we don't want to fashion ourself the
[59:35] way that other churches do
[59:36] we don't fashion ourselves the way the
[59:39] world does
[59:41] but be ye transformed
[59:44] or changed by the renewing
[59:48] of your mind amen by the way you think
[59:51] amen about things
[59:56] so from where we're at when
[59:59] jesus said to peter and andrew come
[1:00:01] follow me
[1:00:02] to where they were going to
[1:00:06] after the day of pentecost was a
[1:00:10] a a large distance
[1:00:14] because there was a period of time that
[1:00:16] they walked with jesus
[1:00:19] and they were still in their carnal
[1:00:21] flesh yes
[1:00:24] still wanting to serve jesus carnally
[1:00:27] with the sword and
[1:00:29] you know if they're not with us they're
[1:00:30] against us and didn't know what
[1:00:32] spirit they had and and this
[1:00:35] carnality if i'm better than soul and
[1:00:37] soul and
[1:00:40] but even though they were following
[1:00:42] jesus they were part of the miracles
[1:00:43] they were going to the services the
[1:00:45] revivals and the things were happening
[1:00:47] they still weren't there in his image
[1:00:49] yet
[1:00:51] amen and god is calling us to something
[1:00:54] greater than where we're at today
[1:00:56] [Applause]
[1:00:58] and we need to focus on that
[1:01:02] we get there we get there
[1:01:06] by the renewing of our mind
[1:01:10] that we may prove what is that good and
[1:01:12] acceptable and perfect will of god for
[1:01:14] our life we've got to change the way we
[1:01:17] think about something
[1:01:18] if you always do what you've always done
[1:01:20] you're always going to get what you
[1:01:21] always got
[1:01:22] and if peter continued to say look i've
[1:01:25] done everything to follow you there's
[1:01:27] nothing else left for me to do
[1:01:30] if you're always going to think like i'm
[1:01:31] under i'm going to take the sword i'm
[1:01:33] going to die for you
[1:01:36] he would never be transformed to be able
[1:01:38] to prove what is the perfect will of god
[1:01:40] and the perfect will of god is to lay
[1:01:42] down your life
[1:01:46] when john saw the line of the tribe of
[1:01:49] judah
[1:01:50] what did he see when he looked a lamb
[1:01:52] slain
[1:01:54] he lay down his life
[1:01:59] that word transform mean change
[1:02:04] means metamorphosed to undergo a change
[1:02:07] in
[1:02:08] nature our nature
[1:02:11] changes by the renewing of the way that
[1:02:15] we think about things in other words
[1:02:16] god's gonna go through the three more
[1:02:18] ages he's not going to put you in a
[1:02:20] trial
[1:02:20] and put your head in a bucket of water
[1:02:22] and saying you're not pulling your head
[1:02:24] out of here until you say
[1:02:25] you'll serve me
[1:02:29] he's going to put you right in that
[1:02:31] trial and he's going to let you make a
[1:02:33] decision
[1:02:34] are you going to die out to your will
[1:02:35] are you going to love when you're not
[1:02:37] being loved
[1:02:38] are you going to give when when there's
[1:02:40] nothing else to give
[1:02:47] you got to change the way you think
[1:02:48] about things about everything
[1:02:54] paul tells us how to work out what we're
[1:02:56] predestined to be cut to become by
[1:02:58] continually
[1:03:00] changing different than what we're used
[1:03:03] to
[1:03:05] make different choices in our mind
[1:03:08] choices that are contrary to our normal
[1:03:10] carnal way of thinking
[1:03:12] it all starts in our mind
[1:03:16] brother braham said our mind is the womb
[1:03:17] to our soul amen
[1:03:27] as our eyes are to the womb of our soul
[1:03:33] eyes eyes but it all starts in our mind
[1:03:39] what we see what we think about
[1:03:46] our carnal flesh our carnal
[1:03:49] fleshly mind is always right
[1:03:53] in the way that we think
[1:03:57] the bible says a man is right in his own
[1:04:00] eyes he's always right in his own eyes
[1:04:05] romans chapter 8 verse 7 says because
[1:04:07] the carnal mind is enmity
[1:04:09] or hostile
[1:04:12] hatred against god for it is not subject
[1:04:14] to the law of god neither indeed can be
[1:04:17] so there's just this battle of the
[1:04:20] carnal mind that's why when we come into
[1:04:21] church
[1:04:22] we don't want to come into church with
[1:04:23] just the carnality
[1:04:25] with a carnal mindset
[1:04:28] because we're going to actually hate the
[1:04:30] word we're going to hate the word
[1:04:33] that god's given us
[1:04:36] that's why we have to deny yourself pick
[1:04:39] up our cross and follow him
[1:04:43] in other words it's not slightly
[1:04:45] different the way that we think is not
[1:04:47] slightly different than the way that god
[1:04:48] thinks
[1:04:50] it is totally different it's night and
[1:04:52] day difference
[1:04:54] and the only way we can be transformed
[1:04:55] into god's image is to be completely
[1:04:58] to completely renovate the way that we
[1:05:00] think we need to
[1:05:02] to gut out we need to gut the walls got
[1:05:05] the stealing
[1:05:06] tear everything out not just change a
[1:05:09] little different furniture
[1:05:11] not just switch churches we need to
[1:05:14] think
[1:05:15] completely different in our box
[1:05:19] renovate the place
[1:05:22] renovate the way we think about things
[1:05:24] in life not just
[1:05:25] about god but about everything how does
[1:05:28] god think about those things that you're
[1:05:29] thinking about
[1:05:30] amen
[1:05:33] philippians chapter 2 verse 5 paul said
[1:05:36] let this mind be in you
[1:05:38] which was also in christ jesus
[1:05:42] keeping in mind now we're being
[1:05:44] transformed
[1:05:45] by the renewing of our mind well i
[1:05:48] i don't want to just you know read a
[1:05:51] little book read a little quote read a
[1:05:53] little something and say well i need to
[1:05:54] kind of like look at things a little bit
[1:05:56] different
[1:05:56] that just won't work for me
[1:06:00] we need to possess the mind of christ
[1:06:04] and so paul is saying let this mind be
[1:06:05] in you which was also in christ jesus
[1:06:07] so what is the mind of christ how does
[1:06:10] it think
[1:06:11] how does it process thoughts verse 4
[1:06:15] says
[1:06:16] look not every man on his own things
[1:06:21] so one way that christ thinks
[1:06:25] is he doesn't think about himself right
[1:06:28] amen but every man also on the things of
[1:06:31] others now can you imagine if we're
[1:06:32] sitting here
[1:06:33] and nobody is selfishly thinking
[1:06:37] about what they want
[1:06:42] but they're actually coming to church
[1:06:44] and they're so concerned
[1:06:46] about the person they're sitting next to
[1:06:47] amen
[1:06:52] verse 3 let nothing be
[1:06:55] done through strife or vain
[1:06:59] glory in other words when you're working
[1:07:01] out a situation
[1:07:03] because you're having a a rough time
[1:07:04] with your boss or with somebody
[1:07:06] you don't have some sort of strife
[1:07:09] and you don't try to prove your right
[1:07:11] just to get vain glory
[1:07:16] but in lowliness of mine
[1:07:19] let each person esteem the other
[1:07:23] person better than themselves
[1:07:29] why this is if i got to think like that
[1:07:32] i might
[1:07:32] the whole way i think is going to be
[1:07:34] different but you're being
[1:07:36] you're being conformed to the image of
[1:07:38] christ
[1:07:39] this is what it means to walk with the
[1:07:41] lord
[1:07:44] philippians chapter 2 verse 7 says but
[1:07:47] jesus made himself of no reputation
[1:07:50] he took upon him the form of a servant
[1:07:52] was made in the likeness of men
[1:07:54] and being found in fashionism and he
[1:07:57] humbled himself and became obedient unto
[1:07:58] death even the death of the cross
[1:08:00] so this is the mind of christ
[1:08:03] talking about the mind of christ
[1:08:08] the mind of christ spoke in john chapter
[1:08:10] 10
[1:08:11] verse 15
[1:08:14] as the father knoweth me even so i know
[1:08:17] the father
[1:08:18] and i lay down my life for the sheep
[1:08:20] right
[1:08:22] this is the mind of christ
[1:08:25] what we just read there in philippians
[1:08:27] about esteeming others and
[1:08:29] it's not about your reputation and it's
[1:08:31] not about strife it's
[1:08:33] it's about esteeming others better than
[1:08:36] yourself
[1:08:38] this is what it means to lay down your
[1:08:40] your life for the other
[1:08:42] fishes right peter come follow me i'll
[1:08:46] make you fishers of men how are you
[1:08:47] going to do it by your own brains no
[1:08:54] amen by this shall men know you're my
[1:08:57] disciples
[1:08:58] when you have this kind of love one for
[1:09:00] another
[1:09:03] amen he says other sheep i must bring in
[1:09:06] you have other sheep
[1:09:07] god wants to use you to bring another
[1:09:09] sheep
[1:09:12] in other words you have a responsibility
[1:09:14] well how do i know that they don't come
[1:09:15] to me i don't feel that i
[1:09:17] you know what one day will stand before
[1:09:18] the lord we'll have to give an account
[1:09:20] what we did with our time
[1:09:21] i'd rather spend my time trying get
[1:09:24] nowhere
[1:09:25] than to sit there and say well i was
[1:09:26] right i didn't have any anyways
[1:09:32] don't let satan talk you into i can't
[1:09:36] let the lord talk you into is my
[1:09:38] responsibility
[1:09:40] therefore doth my father love me why
[1:09:43] does he love me
[1:09:45] because i lay down my life
[1:09:55] no man taketh from me but i lay it down
[1:09:58] of myself i have power to lay it down i
[1:09:59] have power to take it up again
[1:10:01] this commandment i received to my father
[1:10:06] see it going through free more agency
[1:10:08] not being pushed through a situation
[1:10:10] you have a choice to be conformed to the
[1:10:14] image of god lay down your life
[1:10:17] or say yeah it's not for me
[1:10:21] but don't you don't claim predestination
[1:10:23] do what you want to do
[1:10:26] you you received it you res you did not
[1:10:28] receive the revelation
[1:10:29] of predestination it is not going to
[1:10:31] alter your walk with the lord
[1:10:35] if anything it's going to make you sell
[1:10:36] out more
[1:10:40] first john chapter 3 verse 16 how be it
[1:10:42] perceive we the love of god
[1:10:44] because he laid down his life for us we
[1:10:47] should be doing the same thing
[1:10:48] laying down our lives for the brethren
[1:10:51] jesus gives his disciples the same
[1:10:53] commandment that the father gave jesus
[1:10:56] yes same commandment john 15 verse 12
[1:11:00] this is my commandment that you love one
[1:11:02] another as i have loved you
[1:11:04] greater love have no man than this than
[1:11:06] a man laid on his life for his friends
[1:11:09] here my friends if you do whatsoever i
[1:11:11] command you
[1:11:12] now i know when i was first being
[1:11:14] introduced to the lord
[1:11:15] god was not my friend
[1:11:19] i was very content going to a catholic
[1:11:21] church
[1:11:24] didn't bother me to stand up kneel down
[1:11:26] watch the candle see the smoke go across
[1:11:28] here
[1:11:32] i was okay with that why because i
[1:11:34] didn't have to be transformed
[1:11:36] i'd have to change my nature i could
[1:11:38] keep my hair the way it was
[1:11:41] i could look like a girly i could wear
[1:11:44] my pink bell bottoms
[1:11:46] i can walk out of there and go do what i
[1:11:49] want to do
[1:11:53] but i wasn't being conformed
[1:11:56] to god
[1:12:01] praise god that the word saved us
[1:12:05] now we demonstrate by living a life that
[1:12:08] only
[1:12:09] christ can live in a human being
[1:12:12] amen john chapter 13 verse 34 a new
[1:12:16] commandment i give unto you that you
[1:12:18] love one another as i have loved you
[1:12:21] that ye also love one another and by
[1:12:23] this
[1:12:24] all men shall know by this shall all men
[1:12:28] know that you are my disciples if you
[1:12:30] have
[1:12:31] love one for another
[1:12:34] in other words you can't do this on your
[1:12:36] own
[1:12:37] it's impossible for a human being to
[1:12:40] to display christ without the holy ghost
[1:12:48] as much as peter was sold out
[1:12:52] as much as he is willing to take that
[1:12:54] sword and
[1:12:55] die for jesus he did not have the power
[1:13:00] to lay down his life
[1:13:02] amen to be a lamb
[1:13:07] to be conformed into the way
[1:13:12] of jesus christ amen
[1:13:16] jesus had to rebuke him get behind me
[1:13:18] satan
[1:13:19] thou savers the things that be of men
[1:13:25] it's not going to only happen to me but
[1:13:26] you're going to have to lay down your
[1:13:27] life too
[1:13:28] that's exactly what he told them ain't
[1:13:31] no different this age
[1:13:34] this is our time this is our time
[1:13:37] this is our time to be christ
[1:13:41] think about it
[1:13:45] you're here without the prophet
[1:13:47] discerning
[1:13:48] thoughts intents of the heart without
[1:13:51] going through a prayer line
[1:13:53] and seeing things happen miraculously
[1:13:55] but you still believe the same word
[1:14:01] think about it more blessed are they
[1:14:05] that believe and have not seen right
[1:14:07] think about what you're at to
[1:14:09] you're not missing out amen
[1:14:13] you're on top the cream it floats to the
[1:14:16] top
[1:14:18] now the holy spirit wants to renovate
[1:14:21] our minds
[1:14:22] from a selfish way of thinking to a
[1:14:25] selfless
[1:14:26] way of thinking from loving lust to
[1:14:28] loving more
[1:14:30] from loving self to loving others from
[1:14:33] laying down
[1:14:34] your life for yourself right making time
[1:14:37] for yourself
[1:14:38] to laying down your life for others
[1:14:41] from esteeming yourself to esteeming
[1:14:44] others
[1:14:45] from your reputation to
[1:14:49] god's reputation
[1:14:53] what does god want you to do with your
[1:14:55] life
[1:14:57] to exalt his reputation amen
[1:15:00] amen this renovation of our mind is
[1:15:04] really
[1:15:04] the straight gate that jesus is
[1:15:06] admonishes really
[1:15:08] everybody to walk in but everybody won't
[1:15:14] it's not traveled by very many people
[1:15:16] why
[1:15:18] too difficult people want to do their
[1:15:20] own thing right amen
[1:15:22] the harder way for all of us is most
[1:15:24] likely going to be always god's way
[1:15:27] it's not going to be the easy way
[1:15:30] brother brahman said life was not meant
[1:15:32] to be easy it was not meant to be easy
[1:15:36] we strive for it to be easy i believe
[1:15:39] there are two major things that
[1:15:41] the church should be recognizing that
[1:15:43] god is leading us to
[1:15:45] god is leading us to win as many souls
[1:15:47] as possible
[1:15:49] that was the last great commission
[1:15:52] but god is also leading us to come into
[1:15:54] his image to the statue of a perfect man
[1:15:57] the holy ghost inside of us is the only
[1:16:01] thing that will produce
[1:16:02] that it's the only thing that's going to
[1:16:04] produce
[1:16:05] us to really have a burden for souls
[1:16:08] because
[1:16:08] to me man is selfish i'm going to cut
[1:16:11] down my neighbor
[1:16:12] i'm going to do whatever i have to do to
[1:16:14] get what i want
[1:16:16] but god's nature is i'm going to give up
[1:16:17] everything i have to help my neighbor
[1:16:20] amen only the holy ghost can produce
[1:16:23] that
[1:16:24] amen now if we choose to not follow
[1:16:27] god's leading
[1:16:29] then we're going to paralyze god
[1:16:32] from everything that he wants to do
[1:16:36] think about that how i can't just stand
[1:16:40] behind him
[1:16:41] i'm going to be pretty destinated into
[1:16:43] his image
[1:16:44] and it doesn't really matter what i do
[1:16:48] we've got to just cut that thing out of
[1:16:50] our head
[1:16:52] hold ourselves accountable brother
[1:16:54] branham said in the message my new
[1:16:56] ministry
[1:16:56] he said when he looked upon the apostles
[1:16:59] he looked upon the harvest he said
[1:17:01] the harvest is ripe the laborers are few
[1:17:04] pray the lord of the harvest and he'll
[1:17:06] send laborers into his harvest
[1:17:07] how many remember that congregation says
[1:17:09] amen amen
[1:17:11] amen that's what you say amen
[1:17:14] he said well why would they have to pray
[1:17:17] to the lord of harvest to send laborers
[1:17:19] into the harvest if the lord of the
[1:17:20] harvest was standing there knowing
[1:17:22] it would be done why
[1:17:26] he said god is so arranged that and he
[1:17:29] said listen to this
[1:17:31] now listen to this god has so arranged
[1:17:34] it
[1:17:34] that his program cannot move without you
[1:17:37] and i
[1:17:39] free moral agency
[1:17:44] nobody's going to be in heaven accusing
[1:17:47] god
[1:17:47] that he's got a bunch of robots up there
[1:17:52] as long as we're not doing
[1:17:56] what god leads us to do
[1:17:59] we're paralyzing his program
[1:18:03] but when the church moves by the
[1:18:05] anointing
[1:18:06] of the holy ghost then we are in god's
[1:18:09] will
[1:18:10] doing his program amen
[1:18:13] amen now
[1:18:16] the holy ghost i know is not
[1:18:19] leading me the broad
[1:18:23] way the easy way the do what you want
[1:18:27] way your predestinated way
[1:18:30] he's leading me the harder way this
[1:18:33] the straight way the straight narrow
[1:18:36] path
[1:18:37] is harder that's the way he's leading me
[1:18:41] and if i don't follow that leading i
[1:18:43] paralyze him
[1:18:45] from performing his image inside of me
[1:18:50] i hope you catch that
[1:18:54] we can't sit here and say i'm not i
[1:18:55] don't need to do that i'm still in it i
[1:18:57] don't go there you're paralyzing god he
[1:19:00] has to move through your mind
[1:19:01] through free more agency you've got to
[1:19:03] accept it you've got to say not my will
[1:19:05] thy will be done
[1:19:07] we've got too much of this i'm in the
[1:19:09] message i don't care if you're in the
[1:19:11] message
[1:19:11] let the message be in you that's what
[1:19:13] it's about
[1:19:15] and this message is constantly being
[1:19:17] ministered to us every single day
[1:19:19] we get up we get in our prayer closet we
[1:19:21] pray and god speaks to you he says this
[1:19:23] is what i want you to do
[1:19:24] you need to get serious about doing it
[1:19:27] i'll tell you i'll be the first to tell
[1:19:29] you you don't come in god's image by
[1:19:32] serving him for 30 years
[1:19:36] also about to say hey look here i'm
[1:19:38] there
[1:19:41] you don't do it like that it's all about
[1:19:45] your will
[1:19:47] denying yourself following what he tells
[1:19:50] you to do to go the harder way
[1:19:53] amen we're not rallying behind brother
[1:19:56] branham
[1:19:56] we're not rallying behind this thing
[1:19:58] called the message in the last age
[1:20:00] we're taking this glorious message and
[1:20:02] we're saying lord
[1:20:03] live this in me i surrender all to you
[1:20:06] amen that's what we're rallying behind
[1:20:09] the word of god made flesh again
[1:20:18] the bible says when peter when jesus
[1:20:21] asked peter to follow him he
[1:20:23] he dropped his nets straight away he
[1:20:26] he dropped his reputation he followed
[1:20:28] jesus
[1:20:30] and in matthew chapter 19 verse 27
[1:20:35] it wasn't enough then answered peter and
[1:20:39] said unto him
[1:20:40] behold we have forsaken all and follow
[1:20:43] thee
[1:20:44] what is left for me to do
[1:20:50] i already go to church already pay my
[1:20:54] tithe
[1:20:56] i've already accepted the message jesus
[1:21:00] said in the verdict i say unto you that
[1:21:02] ye which have followed me in
[1:21:05] the regeneration when the son of man
[1:21:09] shall sit in the throne of his glory
[1:21:14] he also notices also
[1:21:18] shall sit upon the twelve thrones
[1:21:20] judging the twelve tribes of israel
[1:21:24] we have to follow jesus
[1:21:28] into regeneration now that word
[1:21:31] regeneration
[1:21:32] it means rebirth a spiritual
[1:21:35] renovation is what it means
[1:21:39] so we have to follow god
[1:21:42] we have to follow the holy spirit we
[1:21:44] have to follow the leading
[1:21:46] of the holy spirit which is jesus in us
[1:21:49] to a regeneration a complete
[1:21:52] regeneration
[1:21:53] where he sits on the throne well what's
[1:21:55] the throne the
[1:21:56] throne is your heart
[1:22:00] you are the temple of the holy ghost
[1:22:04] he sits there in the throne of your
[1:22:06] heart
[1:22:08] first he judges your life
[1:22:12] he puts your life in order
[1:22:16] now we don't mind it when anybody comes
[1:22:19] over our house
[1:22:20] even somebody we don't like as long as
[1:22:24] we know
[1:22:25] they don't have to stay
[1:22:31] you come visit that's okay
[1:22:36] but just so you know you ain't stan
[1:22:43] i'll go to church i'll listen to it for
[1:22:46] an hour
[1:22:50] but let that word live inside me
[1:22:57] when he is lord of everything
[1:23:00] that's the throne of his glory
[1:23:07] i don't know when i look to the right or
[1:23:09] i look to the i don't know who's going
[1:23:13] i just know that i want to go
[1:23:16] i want to be in this image i want to
[1:23:19] crucify this flesh i'll tell you there's
[1:23:22] no hope for this world
[1:23:25] there's no hope i just wonder what
[1:23:27] brother brennan would preach today
[1:23:28] if he could see the condition of the
[1:23:30] world today
[1:23:34] the only hope that i have is to let them
[1:23:36] in the throne of my heart
[1:23:38] forget about this world time is coming
[1:23:42] we we we have something so precious and
[1:23:44] that's an opportunity
[1:23:46] god has given us an opportunity to allow
[1:23:49] him to be the
[1:23:50] the the god of glory inside of our
[1:23:53] hearts
[1:23:56] it's got to become more than just
[1:24:00] some head knowledge
[1:24:06] we got to become in his image
[1:24:13] so you become or share his glory when
[1:24:16] you become
[1:24:17] one with god when jesus christ has
[1:24:20] preeminence
[1:24:22] in your heart when you have surrendered
[1:24:24] your will completely to christ
[1:24:26] when he sits on the throne of your heart
[1:24:28] not controlling the world
[1:24:32] controlling you amen
[1:24:36] the heart becomes the throne of his
[1:24:38] glory
[1:24:40] where the spirit of the lord is there is
[1:24:42] liberty
[1:24:44] to change us from glory unto glory
[1:24:48] so it becomes more glorious
[1:24:52] the holy spirit wants to change us to
[1:24:54] become him
[1:24:56] john chapter 17 verse 20 neither pray i
[1:24:58] for these
[1:25:00] alone but for them also which shall
[1:25:03] believe on me
[1:25:04] through the word through their word
[1:25:06] that's why it's important when you speak
[1:25:08] speak god's word yes that they
[1:25:12] all may be one as thou father and me and
[1:25:15] i in thee
[1:25:16] that they also may be one in us that the
[1:25:18] world may believe that thou has sent me
[1:25:20] so
[1:25:21] right now while you've got one group
[1:25:23] trying to push one thing
[1:25:25] another group trying to push another
[1:25:27] thing and and and
[1:25:29] you know devil's author of confusion he
[1:25:31] don't care what's being pushed out there
[1:25:33] as long as it's not christ amen
[1:25:36] and so only thing we care about we know
[1:25:39] we cannot save this world we cannot turn
[1:25:41] this world around
[1:25:42] we cannot get enough people to stand up
[1:25:44] and say we've got the truth
[1:25:46] just follow us clean up this whole world
[1:25:49] it can never happen
[1:25:50] but but god wants to use us
[1:25:54] amen for those that are predestined for
[1:25:57] those that yet
[1:25:58] have to be saved yes that's all he wants
[1:26:02] because this world is destined to burn
[1:26:05] right
[1:26:06] amen it's going to be judged it's going
[1:26:09] to be
[1:26:10] burned and we don't care about it
[1:26:13] jesus said we're not of the world they
[1:26:16] are not of the world
[1:26:19] amen but he's placed us in the world
[1:26:22] amen
[1:26:22] to be a light yes to reach a soul
[1:26:27] that when we get to the other side you
[1:26:28] can stand and say
[1:26:30] lord here are the trophies that i
[1:26:32] present you
[1:26:33] [Music]
[1:26:34] that's the truth you will present
[1:26:37] someone to christ
[1:26:38] if now you will give an account for your
[1:26:40] time
[1:26:43] we have to be about the father's
[1:26:44] business
[1:26:48] we need to become one
[1:26:51] look at verse 22 and the glory which
[1:26:54] thou gavest me
[1:26:55] i have given them noah's
[1:26:58] it's tied with being one that they may
[1:27:01] be one
[1:27:02] even as we are one right when god sits
[1:27:06] on your heart one with your will you've
[1:27:09] surrendered your will
[1:27:10] there's where god gets glory he's not
[1:27:13] gonna get glory by john martin saying
[1:27:15] he's something
[1:27:18] people are going to look at me look at
[1:27:19] that monkey
[1:27:23] but when they see you lay down your life
[1:27:26] as christ laid down his life
[1:27:32] i in them and thou in me that they may
[1:27:35] be perfect
[1:27:35] one and that the world may know that i
[1:27:38] have
[1:27:39] that thou hast sent me and as and has
[1:27:43] loved them as thou has loved me
[1:27:47] think about it jesus wants the world
[1:27:50] know
[1:27:51] that you are his disciple and that you
[1:27:52] sent you're sending them to whoever
[1:27:54] you're talking to
[1:27:58] so when you're going and you want to
[1:27:59] witness to somebody you're talking to
[1:28:01] somebody
[1:28:03] god wants that person to know
[1:28:06] who you're talking to that god sent you
[1:28:08] to them
[1:28:11] because your job is to bring that person
[1:28:14] to jesus
[1:28:16] that's your goal to be a fisher of men
[1:28:22] not to prove they're wrong not to prove
[1:28:24] your rights
[1:28:26] but to prove that jesus christ is alive
[1:28:28] he's coming soon
[1:28:30] it's all the matters
[1:28:34] john chapter 14 verse 26 jesus said at
[1:28:37] that
[1:28:38] day he shall know that i'm in the father
[1:28:40] and he and me and i and you
[1:28:42] there's that day where that oneness is
[1:28:44] there amen
[1:28:46] the only way we can really become one
[1:28:48] with god is for you to give up your will
[1:28:51] there's no way you can hold on to your
[1:28:53] will and be one with christ
[1:28:55] he's not going to share his his glory
[1:28:57] with any flesh
[1:28:59] it won't inherit the kingdom amen
[1:29:02] [Music]
[1:29:04] now our oneness is going to happen we
[1:29:07] will manifest christ
[1:29:08] we will be conformed to the image of god
[1:29:12] because we've been predestined amen
[1:29:15] first john chapter 3 verse 1
[1:29:18] behold what manner
[1:29:21] of love the father bestowed upon us
[1:29:26] that we sitting here today
[1:29:30] should be called the sons of god
[1:29:34] therefore the world doesn't even know it
[1:29:39] the world doesn't know us because it
[1:29:42] knew him not
[1:29:45] if it didn't know jesus it so
[1:29:48] makes sense that they don't know us you
[1:29:51] know in one way
[1:29:53] god wants everyone to know in one way
[1:29:58] right he died for the whole world he
[1:30:00] would that none would perish
[1:30:02] but in another way he's hid it from the
[1:30:05] spirits of the wise and prudent
[1:30:10] from those that just want to mock it and
[1:30:12] turn it down and spit on them anyways
[1:30:14] yes sir right yes
[1:30:18] beloved now are we the sons of god
[1:30:21] and it does not yet appear right
[1:30:24] what we shall be but we know that when
[1:30:28] he shall appear
[1:30:30] we're going to be like him now that word
[1:30:33] like him means
[1:30:34] similar in character
[1:30:39] that's something that i can have today
[1:30:43] amen that's not something i have to wait
[1:30:46] for a twinkling of an eye or at the end
[1:30:48] or
[1:30:49] when i get on the other side
[1:30:52] i have to make better
[1:30:55] decisions in the middle of my trials
[1:30:58] that's how i get character for we shall
[1:31:01] see him
[1:31:02] as he is you know how many times you're
[1:31:05] talking to somebody say
[1:31:06] well the white the way i think it is the
[1:31:08] way i
[1:31:09] see this the way i look at jesus
[1:31:13] everybody's got their own opinion right
[1:31:16] in other words
[1:31:17] we really don't see clearly
[1:31:20] but when you become him you see
[1:31:23] things clearly you see him clearly
[1:31:27] the only way you can know him is to
[1:31:28] become him
[1:31:31] because he hid it from this he's
[1:31:34] revealed it to this
[1:31:37] now look at this verse verse 3 and every
[1:31:40] man
[1:31:41] that has this hope in him
[1:31:46] purifyeth himself even as he is pure
[1:31:52] he does something he does something
[1:31:57] to purify himself what does he do
[1:32:00] he agrees with the word that's been
[1:32:03] given to her
[1:32:04] amen the groom gives the bride
[1:32:08] the word the bride agrees with
[1:32:11] it and the word is not always
[1:32:14] your pre just say don't worry about it
[1:32:19] which there's truth to that i'm not
[1:32:22] taking it away
[1:32:23] but what makes that so dangerous
[1:32:28] we don't feel like working anything out
[1:32:31] we're not going to purify anything we
[1:32:33] need to get busy
[1:32:35] at purifying ourself changing the way we
[1:32:38] think
[1:32:41] realizing that we have about a short
[1:32:43] time to get ready
[1:32:44] to get conformed into his image because
[1:32:47] he's coming back for his
[1:32:49] the other half of him amen
[1:32:52] he's not coming back for opposites
[1:32:55] right opposites attraction
[1:32:58] that's why we got in so much trouble
[1:33:02] so are we getting trouble but in reality
[1:33:06] he's coming back for the other half of
[1:33:08] him amen
[1:33:10] and where's that at it's inside of you
[1:33:12] amen
[1:33:13] that's why it's important to be serious
[1:33:15] about the word
[1:33:16] to become the word not just to agree
[1:33:18] with it but to become it
[1:33:24] god is not going to do one thing by
[1:33:27] himself to change you
[1:33:31] god doesn't have robots he will always
[1:33:34] work
[1:33:34] through your free more agency you've
[1:33:36] always got to agree with it before
[1:33:38] he'll do the change god will lead and
[1:33:42] guide you
[1:33:43] into your change
[1:33:48] he promised when the holy spirit come
[1:33:50] he'll lead guide you to all truth
[1:33:52] well what is the truth he wants for you
[1:33:54] to change and to become in his image
[1:33:58] not just well this is the correct
[1:34:00] baptism
[1:34:02] right right the change
[1:34:05] of your character
[1:34:09] but god is not going to change you
[1:34:11] without you
[1:34:13] i love being predestinated i love that
[1:34:16] god is predestined me
[1:34:18] predestinated me into his image yes but
[1:34:21] what that really means to me
[1:34:23] is that my flesh is gonna have to suffer
[1:34:26] to be crucified and i'm gonna have to
[1:34:29] mortify the deeds of the body
[1:34:31] amen the deeds of my body that's what
[1:34:34] that
[1:34:34] really really means
[1:34:36] [Applause]
[1:34:39] in the beginning god created
[1:34:44] when he originally created man he
[1:34:45] created man in his own image
[1:34:48] just he's by the spoken word he spoke it
[1:34:51] and man was in his own image
[1:34:53] today we were born with a nature that is
[1:34:56] satanic it is so unlike god
[1:35:02] speaking of character now
[1:35:06] and now we by his spoken word
[1:35:10] are being conformed into that same image
[1:35:14] that was created at the beginning now
[1:35:16] you tell me how we're going to get there
[1:35:18] without trying
[1:35:25] yes yes without belief we won't get
[1:35:27] there
[1:35:29] but the belief is that we have to
[1:35:30] surrender to the whole word of god
[1:35:35] it ain't believing sitting on a hammock
[1:35:38] it's believing when you get put through
[1:35:40] that trial
[1:35:40] you're you're conforming to the image
[1:35:42] the way that god would handle that trial
[1:35:49] first we must be conformed
[1:35:53] to god's way of thinking about things
[1:35:56] we must let the mind of christ that be
[1:35:58] in us
[1:36:00] we're not going to make it without it
[1:36:03] god's word
[1:36:04] must become the absolute for the way
[1:36:07] that we live
[1:36:10] we live the way christ lived everything
[1:36:13] that christ
[1:36:14] did we do
[1:36:17] he lived for others we live for others
[1:36:21] he lay down his life for the world we
[1:36:23] lay down our lives for the world
[1:36:26] he denied making himself a reputation we
[1:36:29] deny making
[1:36:30] ourselves a reputation he prayed for his
[1:36:33] enemy
[1:36:34] we pray for our enemies he loved
[1:36:37] everyone
[1:36:37] we love everyone
[1:36:41] he didn't have respect to persons then
[1:36:44] we don't have respect to persons
[1:36:46] he exercised forgiveness then we
[1:36:49] exercise forgiveness
[1:36:53] so when you do what christ done
[1:36:57] then you're in his image
[1:37:00] why would you stop short of pressing in
[1:37:04] until you've seen it just because
[1:37:07] pray destination
[1:37:12] you have to be conformed into every
[1:37:16] one of these things yes conformed
[1:37:20] to it
[1:37:24] and i'll say it like this transformed by
[1:37:26] the way that you think
[1:37:28] a lot of times we think what does it
[1:37:30] matter it's not fair
[1:37:32] i shouldn't have to go through this you
[1:37:33] got to change the way that you think
[1:37:35] right everything that christ went
[1:37:38] through down here
[1:37:38] was not fair he's the lord of lords the
[1:37:41] king of kings
[1:37:42] he didn't have to come down here he
[1:37:45] shouldn't have had to come down here
[1:37:47] he suffered at the hands of men
[1:37:50] and we think we're going to make it on
[1:37:51] flowery beds of ease
[1:37:54] just because he predestinated us
[1:37:57] must jesus bear the cross alone there's
[1:38:00] a cross for every one of us
[1:38:02] and the cross is crucifying the flesh
[1:38:13] forgiveness is a characteristic of the
[1:38:16] image of christ
[1:38:19] forgiveness started with god
[1:38:22] and it continues on manifesting through
[1:38:24] you and i
[1:38:29] because you're in his image you were
[1:38:32] forgiven by god a debt that you could
[1:38:34] not pay back
[1:38:35] right it was impossible to pay god back
[1:38:39] and now you have been given the
[1:38:43] opportunity
[1:38:44] to forgive others a debt
[1:38:48] that they can't pay back to you
[1:38:51] i want you to think about that i want
[1:38:52] you to think about the things that
[1:38:54] people
[1:38:55] have said to you done to you and
[1:38:58] and you that feeling and having
[1:39:01] that there in your life
[1:39:06] but you've been given an opportunity
[1:39:10] to forgive them just like christ forgave
[1:39:13] you a debt
[1:39:14] that could not be paid
[1:39:16] [Music]
[1:39:18] so what are you going to do with your
[1:39:19] opportunity will you display the image
[1:39:23] of christ
[1:39:25] or will you display your own image
[1:39:28] amen
[1:39:31] will you expect more from them will you
[1:39:34] feel
[1:39:35] deemed them unworthy to be forgiven
[1:39:40] you hold things against them
[1:39:44] see it's not about being predestinated
[1:39:46] friends
[1:39:48] it's about working out your
[1:39:49] predestination by proving
[1:39:52] that you're in the image of christ today
[1:39:58] forgiveness is like a key that unlocks
[1:40:01] the door to more of the image of christ
[1:40:04] most view that in order for a person to
[1:40:06] move forward with god
[1:40:08] you must be able to forgive others
[1:40:11] because that's what jesus
[1:40:12] he spoke that he made it clear he says
[1:40:14] if you forgive not mend their trespasses
[1:40:16] then your forgiveness basically stops
[1:40:19] right
[1:40:19] that's right i want us to take a look at
[1:40:22] this from a standpoint of
[1:40:24] just love for just a moment just love
[1:40:29] god loved the world but he could not
[1:40:31] move forward
[1:40:32] with them until he forgave them
[1:40:37] and that's why he went to calvary
[1:40:40] so he could put it behind them broke the
[1:40:43] middle wall partition
[1:40:44] down and had fellowship and communion
[1:40:47] with his bride again
[1:40:48] he could not move forward without
[1:40:51] forgiveness
[1:40:57] forgiveness brought them back in harmony
[1:40:59] with god
[1:41:01] and the true evidence of god's
[1:41:02] forgiveness was when jesus laid down his
[1:41:05] life
[1:41:07] at calvary
[1:41:10] and today you cannot move forward
[1:41:14] with that person without forgiving
[1:41:18] them your love
[1:41:21] is so important to bring them back
[1:41:24] into harmony so it's not just a
[1:41:28] law that god put out
[1:41:34] it's about being family
[1:41:38] we're all guilty amen every single
[1:41:41] person is guilty
[1:41:45] we have to learn to exercise that great
[1:41:48] key
[1:41:48] of forgiveness it shows and proves
[1:41:52] you're in the image of christ
[1:41:54] it is the image of christ
[1:42:00] from a standpoint of love you can't move
[1:42:02] forward with anyone until you forgive
[1:42:03] them
[1:42:06] forgiveness is who christ is
[1:42:10] 7 times 70 he said
[1:42:14] i'll just say it like this as long as
[1:42:15] somebody's got breath in them
[1:42:19] there's hope forgive him we must be
[1:42:22] conformed to his image we must
[1:42:24] let go of grudges put things behind us
[1:42:28] we must let go and forgive because
[1:42:31] we've been predestinated to become just
[1:42:34] like jesus
[1:42:37] i want to say it like this if you never
[1:42:39] heard
[1:42:40] the word message and you never heard
[1:42:43] the word william branham you have
[1:42:46] heard the message
[1:42:50] that christ wants you to hear
[1:42:54] god sent a prophet to get us that
[1:42:56] message
[1:43:00] you don't need to tell people about
[1:43:02] william branham even though you should
[1:43:05] even though you should but just saying
[1:43:09] here's william branham isn't going to
[1:43:10] attract them
[1:43:12] [Music]
[1:43:13] but when they see jesus in you when
[1:43:16] you're able to lay down your life
[1:43:18] when you get hit on the face you get
[1:43:20] taught by you get stabbed in the back
[1:43:22] you get treated like nothing and you
[1:43:25] still love as they're their best friend
[1:43:28] amen
[1:43:31] i'm personally thankful for the
[1:43:32] privilege of being able
[1:43:35] to show mercy to others
[1:43:39] because it shows that i'm being
[1:43:41] conformed into the image of christ
[1:43:44] head knowledge isn't the image of christ
[1:43:47] head knowledge won't conform to showing
[1:43:50] mercy
[1:43:51] head knowledge is going to say you're
[1:43:53] guilty
[1:43:55] we all know we're guilty amen we all can
[1:43:58] stand up here
[1:43:59] and judge every single person in this
[1:44:00] church
[1:44:02] of something it's true
[1:44:06] and if you don't know that much about
[1:44:08] that person talk to him a little bit and
[1:44:10] then you'll know
[1:44:12] but we have no problem judging anybody
[1:44:15] we're built for it
[1:44:22] but christ is decreasing us
[1:44:27] i must decrease that he must increase
[1:44:31] that we may show mercy show grace show
[1:44:34] love
[1:44:36] come in the image of christ i want to
[1:44:39] end with this quote here that brother
[1:44:41] branham preached an adoption
[1:44:43] number four part four
[1:44:48] he said it's all about love yes
[1:44:52] everything now speaking of adoption here
[1:44:56] he'll end with it everything is real
[1:44:58] brother everything is real
[1:45:00] sister he's speaking of when
[1:45:04] he crossed the other side he's sharing
[1:45:06] it he said there's no death
[1:45:08] there's no sorrow there's no jealousy no
[1:45:10] nothing nothing
[1:45:11] can enter there
[1:45:16] it's just perfection amen he said
[1:45:19] that's what i'm striving for
[1:45:24] not one i'm pretty destinated too
[1:45:28] he said that's what i'm striving for
[1:45:31] we've got to work out our predestination
[1:45:33] [Music]
[1:45:35] he said that's what i'm placing for i
[1:45:38] love this quote now it's short
[1:45:40] so pay attention
[1:45:44] i said oh lord that's what i'm here at
[1:45:46] the church for
[1:45:48] i'm trying to set the church in order
[1:45:51] telling you brother sister there's only
[1:45:54] one thing that can enter
[1:45:56] that and that's perfect love
[1:46:00] not because you're loyal to branham
[1:46:02] tabernacle
[1:46:03] or the methodist church or the baptist
[1:46:05] church
[1:46:07] them is all right you should be but
[1:46:10] old friends not because you spoke in
[1:46:12] tongues danced in the spirit
[1:46:14] because you cast out devils or moved
[1:46:16] mountains with faith
[1:46:19] he said that's all right for that's all
[1:46:22] right
[1:46:23] says it twice but still unless the real
[1:46:26] perfect love is in there
[1:46:31] that's that was where perfect love was
[1:46:36] now listen to this sentence and that's
[1:46:38] the only thing
[1:46:40] that will let you in there
[1:46:46] that's the only thing that will let you
[1:46:48] in there
[1:46:53] that's the only thing that can stay
[1:46:56] there
[1:46:57] it's the only thing that was there oh my
[1:47:00] it's an adoption yes
[1:47:04] that's what we're being adopted too
[1:47:08] to the image of christ
[1:47:11] to being able to manifest it and and
[1:47:14] brother sister
[1:47:15] you can go home today with the desire in
[1:47:18] your heart
[1:47:19] lord let the first trial come and let me
[1:47:22] let me
[1:47:22] shine for you let me display you
[1:47:27] that's all that matters
[1:47:30] who cares about telling anybody anything
[1:47:35] just live it right live out perfect love
[1:47:38] amen amen
[1:47:42] he said god before the foundation
[1:47:45] of the world we've been predestinated
[1:47:48] to this perfect love before the
[1:47:51] foundation of the world
[1:47:52] we just didn't understand because we
[1:47:53] grew up in a bunch of selfish stingy
[1:47:55] love
[1:47:57] and then we come into this message
[1:47:58] trying to you know
[1:48:00] find our place on you know how do i act
[1:48:03] and
[1:48:04] you know still holding on to part of the
[1:48:06] world and trying to love but not being
[1:48:08] able to do it and just
[1:48:10] you know trying to you know have a form
[1:48:17] but the holy ghost will take you all the
[1:48:18] way amen
[1:48:20] it'll stamp his image in you amen if you
[1:48:23] want it
[1:48:23] you hunger for it you thirst for it you
[1:48:25] desire it
[1:48:27] god promised to fill you
[1:48:31] it's a promise but it ain't happened as
[1:48:34] much as you want
[1:48:35] i say hunger more there's more cry out
[1:48:38] for god more
[1:48:39] amen you shall seek me and find me when
[1:48:41] you search for me with all thy heart
[1:48:47] it won't be for those who could take it
[1:48:49] or leave it i'll tell you that
[1:48:51] because brother branham said this harder
[1:48:53] way is so he says you've got to actually
[1:48:54] get to the place
[1:48:55] where you can love everybody in fact he
[1:48:58] said i don't care what's important to
[1:48:59] you you must lay aside everything else
[1:49:01] until you can get to that place where
[1:49:03] you can love everyone the same
[1:49:06] that means you're caring about their
[1:49:08] reputation as much as you're
[1:49:09] more than yours amen you care about
[1:49:12] esteeming your enemy more than yourself
[1:49:16] get to that place lay everything else
[1:49:20] aside that means you've got to really
[1:49:21] want it bad
[1:49:23] amen let's stand together god bless you
[1:49:27] god is leading you to be conformed to
[1:49:30] his image
[1:49:35] what an honor what a privilege that god
[1:49:38] called us and that we recognized
[1:49:39] amen the call
[1:49:42] amen praise the lord
[1:49:47] well we're gonna maybe sing some
[1:49:49] acapella
[1:49:52] i'm not sure if we got a piano player
[1:49:56] yes i hear the doors opening

[1:51:58] with love and make
