[35:55] time.
[35:57] He is our peace
[36:01] who has broken down every wall.
[36:07] He is our peace.
[36:12] He is our peace. Peace
[36:17] cast our peace
[36:20] who has broken down every wall.
[36:27] He is our peace.
[36:32] He is our peace.
[36:37] Cast all your cares on him
[36:41] for he cares for you.
[36:46] He is our peace.
[36:51] He is our peace.
[36:56] Cast all your cares on him
[37:00] for he cares for you.
[37:03] [Music]
[37:05] He is our peace.
[37:10] He is our peace.
[37:16] Amen. Let's give the Lord a praise
[37:19] offering.
[37:22] [Applause]
[37:27] We have someone that holds us
[37:31] when we need to be held.
[37:35] &gt;&gt; What a what a very sad time it is among
[37:39] us.
[37:41] There's really no words that can
[37:46] that can meet all the needs that we
[37:48] have,
[37:50] all the things that we feel, all the
[37:53] loss.
[37:56] God is uh plucked a flower out of his
[37:59] garden for heaven.
[38:02] &gt;&gt; We have lost a faithful soldier of the
[38:05] cross, one that will be greatly missed.
[38:11] Um,
[38:15] the scriptures tells us that we shall
[38:17] not all sleep,
[38:20] but there there's going to be a rapture.
[38:25] And I believe everybody that has died in
[38:29] the Lord
[38:32] would leave these words behind
[38:37] to get ready to meet me in the air.
[38:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[38:41] &gt;&gt; And I believe that we
[38:43] we need to put every effort that we have
[38:47] um to press into Christ. I just believe
[38:50] that would be
[38:52] what our brother would want us to do if
[38:54] he would be to come back and give us
[38:56] some words. I'm leaving. He would want
[38:59] us to press him.
[39:02] Um
[39:04] I I'm I'm sorry I did not get to hear
[39:06] what brother uh Ron said. So if any of
[39:10] this is uh re repeated uh forgive me. Uh
[39:14] but um they have elected to have not a
[39:18] funeral service. Brother Bruce will be
[39:20] uh cremated.
[39:23] Uh but we were able
[39:27] um to get uh a service we could have a
[39:32] celebration of life with brother Bruce.
[39:35] Um and that will be
[39:37] on September 20th or I should say a
[39:40] celebration life for brother Bruce. we
[39:43] uh that we could
[39:45] uh get together and
[39:50] just got decided right right before the
[39:52] men's meeting. So, she was unsure
[39:55] whether we're to even do that, but I
[39:59] believe it would be a blessing to all
[40:00] the people to to have that. So, we're
[40:05] thankful that she was was willing um
[40:09] they are going to do something with
[40:10] their own family and just drive around
[40:14] to certain places that brother Bruce
[40:16] liked and just have their own private
[40:19] time together. They're kind of a private
[40:22] people in that arena.
[40:25] Um but we are thankful for brother Bruce
[40:28] and I um
[40:32] order she supported him in the ministry
[40:34] and the ministry was God-given and many
[40:38] people were were helped through the
[40:40] ministry
[40:42] and so we're thankful for the life of
[40:44] brother Bruce. We're just so thankful
[40:48] and he's going to be missed and
[40:52] um I'm looking forward to seeing him on
[40:54] the other side
[40:57] and we're thankful for the
[41:01] for him being a part of our assembly
[41:05] and I really believe he had grown so
[41:07] much
[41:09] in his time with us
[41:12] and we're we're grateful. We believe it
[41:15] was not an accident that he was among us
[41:20] and God used him to be a great blessing
[41:22] to all of us. Amen.
[41:24] Amen.
[41:26] But if you would turn with me to the
[41:28] book of Psalms for opening scripture.
[41:45] Let's pray for brother Ron also because
[41:47] there's a little bit more of a wait on
[41:50] him now
[41:53] um with having to do two services and
[42:02] amen Psalms
[42:05] chapter 61 we're going to read the two
[42:08] first two verses and have a word of
[42:09] prayer hear my cry oh God attend unto my
[42:13] prayer From the end of the earth will I
[42:16] cry unto thee.
[42:19] When my heart is overwhelmed, lead me to
[42:22] the rock that is higher than I.
[42:25] Amen. Our heavenly father, we thank you
[42:29] for the comfort that we get from your
[42:31] word.
[42:34] We know that if anybody else spoke to
[42:38] us, their word,
[42:41] there would be question to doubt.
[42:44] But your word
[42:47] cannot fail. It cannot lie.
[42:50] And we know that there is a rock for us
[42:54] that is higher than us that we can get
[42:56] strength from to help us in all of our
[43:00] need.
[43:02] And we pray tonight,
[43:05] Lord, first that you would remember
[43:08] Sister Donna.
[43:10] Uh that you would remember Ruth and
[43:15] Rebecca and just the extended family
[43:20] and that you would comfort them and and
[43:23] strengthen them and help them through
[43:25] this transition.
[43:29] Lord, that certainly has been a
[43:32] tremendous shock to them.
[43:37] You are the only one that can give us
[43:42] the help that they need. And we pray,
[43:46] Lord, that you would bless them with
[43:48] inner strength and peace, comfort that
[43:52] only can come from heaven.
[43:56] May it shine upon them and rest upon
[43:59] them. And Lord, we we thank you for the
[44:04] grace that you have given them.
[44:08] Lord, we thank you for being their rock,
[44:11] our rock, and the rock to all your
[44:15] children. Father, come and bless your
[44:18] word to our heart now as we look to thee
[44:21] for comfort.
[44:23] We pray these things in Jesus Christ's
[44:25] name. Amen. God bless you. May be
[44:28] seated. Um,
[44:32] Sister Donna is doing well.
[44:36] Um, she got a good night's rest and she
[44:39] had support from her friend.
[44:43] Um,
[44:46] and so I'm happy to announce um today
[44:49] that she's doing much better than she
[44:51] was doing earlier. Uh, we are probably
[44:54] going to be doing something with food.
[44:56] Maybe. I'm not sure yet, but we're going
[44:59] to. We got the okay to do that today. We
[45:02] didn't get the okay to do much of
[45:03] anything at the beginning, but praise
[45:06] God. Um,
[45:09] we do. And we're just thankful for our
[45:12] sister. She she loves the church and
[45:15] loves the people and
[45:18] wants us to be a blessing to her too.
[45:22] Amen. We'd like to entitle this message
[45:24] higher God.
[45:26] &gt;&gt; Higher God. And for a subject, God is
[45:28] leading us higher through our
[45:31] situations.
[45:34] Hear my cry, oh God. Attend unto my
[45:37] prayer. For from the end of the earth,
[45:40] from the very end of the earth, will I
[45:41] cry unto thee when my heart is
[45:44] overwhelmed,
[45:45] lead me to the rock that is higher than
[45:49] I. Now, we've all had situations where
[45:52] we felt just overwhelmed and there have
[45:56] been times we've had weeks that we felt
[45:58] overwhelmed
[46:01] and we just to the end we just really
[46:03] don't know what to do with our
[46:05] situation.
[46:08] We've invited God to live inside of us,
[46:12] but sometimes we're still searching for
[46:15] him.
[46:17] We've heard God knows our very thoughts,
[46:20] but sometimes we wonder.
[46:24] Does God hear our prayers?
[46:28] We heard that God cares for us, but
[46:30] sometimes we wonder where he's at in our
[46:33] situations in life.
[46:36] The Bible says he is our peace. We sung
[46:38] that song. But sometimes we feel in
[46:41] turmoil and confused and searching for
[46:44] that peace.
[46:46] We know that God said he'll never leave
[46:48] us nor forsake us. But sometimes we
[46:50] still feel alone.
[46:56] So when God allows these things to
[46:58] happen in our life, it can cause us to
[47:00] question the very nature of God.
[47:04] When our heart is overwhelmed, it can
[47:06] cause us to ponder or analyze where is
[47:08] he in this situation of
[47:10] overwhelmingness.
[47:13] Sometimes it's hard to understand the
[47:15] ways of God. To be honest with you,
[47:18] why he does what he does, why he allows
[47:21] what he allows,
[47:23] why we're left alone to wonder without
[47:26] answers, to suffer without comfort, to
[47:28] be afflicted without relief.
[47:32] Isaiah 55:8 says, "For my thoughts are
[47:35] not your thoughts.
[47:37] &gt;&gt; Neither are your ways my ways, sayeth
[47:39] the Lord.
[47:40] &gt;&gt; For as the heavens are higher than the
[47:42] earth, so are my ways higher than your
[47:44] ways and my thoughts than your
[47:46] thoughts." So we can never understand
[47:50] God's thoughts or his ways on our level.
[47:54] Amen.
[47:57] &gt;&gt; The answers to learning about God's ways
[48:00] cannot be understood through human
[48:02] intellect or human ability. The very
[48:05] thoughts of God are so much higher than
[48:08] the very thoughts of man.
[48:10] &gt;&gt; Turn with me if you would to first
[48:12] Corinthians
[48:13] chapter 2
[48:16] verse 9.
[48:18] staying in this same vein of not being
[48:22] able to
[48:23] uh understand why we why we feel alone
[48:27] sometimes when we know the Bible says
[48:29] he'll never leave us nor forsake us.
[48:33] 2 Corinthians 2:9 says, "But it is is
[48:36] written, I have not seen nor ear heard,
[48:38] neither have it entered into the heart
[48:39] of man the things which God have
[48:42] prepared for them that love him."
[48:46] So, it hasn't even entered into the the
[48:49] realm of of man to understand the things
[48:53] of God.
[48:55] But God has revealed them unto us by his
[48:59] spirit.
[49:01] Notice, but God have revealed them unto
[49:05] us by his spirit. For the spirit
[49:08] searchth all things, the deep things of
[49:10] God. For what man knoweth the things of
[49:12] a man, save the spirit of a man which is
[49:14] in him? Even so, the things of God
[49:16] knoweth no man but the spirit of God. So
[49:18] for us to be in our carnal state of
[49:21] feeling this overwhelmingness and nobody
[49:24] cares and nobody understands and nobody
[49:26] sees what I'm going through to be in
[49:28] that state of feeling alone.
[49:33] We can never understand where God is at.
[49:39] We have to go back to the word
[49:43] &gt;&gt; where the word tells us it's through the
[49:45] spirit that we understand the ways of
[49:47] God.
[49:50] &gt;&gt; Now we have received not the spirit of
[49:52] the world but the spirit which is of God
[49:56] that we might know the things that are
[49:58] freely given to us of God.
[50:01] Which things also we speak not in the
[50:03] words which man's wisdom teaches. We're
[50:07] not up here trying to teach the things
[50:08] of God with man's wisdom, but which the
[50:11] Holy Ghost teacheth, comparing spiritual
[50:14] things with spiritual, but the natural
[50:16] man receiveth not the things of the
[50:18] spirit of God, for they are foolishness
[50:20] unto him, neither can he know them,
[50:22] neither uh they are spirit because they
[50:25] are spiritually discerned. Now, this is
[50:27] the thing about the the the the things
[50:29] of the natural man. When you go to try a
[50:32] try to try to tell a natural man the
[50:35] things of God that they are foolishness
[50:38] unto him.
[50:43] It It's only the spirit of God inside of
[50:48] a man
[50:50] that can receive the things of God
[50:53] &gt;&gt; because the Bible tells us to do a lot
[50:55] of things that just don't fit into our
[50:57] schedule.
[51:00] like to pray without ceasing,
[51:04] like to keep your mind stayed on him,
[51:08] like um
[51:11] there's many things,
[51:15] but if you you you if if you just trust
[51:20] the word and not try to go through the
[51:23] understanding of the natural man, which
[51:27] will certainly get you more confused,
[51:30] Because usually when we're overwhelmed,
[51:32] we just want God to fix the problem.
[51:36] &gt;&gt; We don't need something else to do. We
[51:38] don't need something else to preoccupy
[51:40] our time. We just want this thing taken
[51:42] care of.
[51:45] &gt;&gt; But this thing that's there in our life
[51:48] is the thing that God had ordained
[51:50] there. And God does not waste anything
[51:53] when he wants to build character.
[51:56] &gt;&gt; He doesn't waste a thing. He's not a
[51:59] waster.
[52:02] God reveals his nature to us through the
[52:05] spirit.
[52:10] Eye has not seen, ears not heard,
[52:11] neither enter into the heart of man the
[52:13] things that God had prepared for them
[52:15] that love him. What does God have
[52:17] prepared for them that love him? It is
[52:19] the nature of God. That is the only
[52:21] thing that's going to be in heaven. He
[52:23] brother Brandon says the only thing
[52:24] we're taking with us is the character of
[52:26] God.
[52:31] God reveals his nature to us through the
[52:34] spirit. It can't be through the natural
[52:36] part.
[52:38] It's hidden in the word. Of course, the
[52:41] nature of God is hidden in the word, but
[52:43] it takes the spirit of God to reveal it
[52:45] to us. He just doesn't reveal it to
[52:47] anybody,
[52:49] right? He hides it from the wise and
[52:50] prudent.
[52:52] He He hides it from those. It's not
[52:55] everybody that goes to church that gets
[52:57] it.
[52:59] &gt;&gt; It's only those who love him. That's
[53:02] what the Bible says.
[53:04] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[53:05] &gt;&gt; He's prepared it for those that love
[53:06] him. When you love God enough to say,
[53:08] "This is the word. I think I'm just
[53:10] going to do it regardless of how I
[53:11] feel." That is where God reveals
[53:13] himself. That's where God gives the
[53:16] strength.
[53:19] God was leading David to a higher place
[53:22] than where he was.
[53:23] This was not just something that
[53:26] happened to David by some haphazard
[53:30] chance and David just, you know, wanted
[53:32] to get up to a higher place. No, God was
[53:36] actually he orchestrated the situation.
[53:41] And God was actually leading David to a
[53:44] higher place, a higher place than where
[53:46] he was, a place that there was rest from
[53:48] the storm. a place that there was peace
[53:51] uh from the pressure that he was going
[53:53] through.
[53:57] You know, to me it's character
[54:01] when you can
[54:04] be in a place of trust
[54:08] when you're feeling overwhelmed.
[54:13] You know, naturally, you you take a a
[54:15] 2-year-old, a three-year-old, and you
[54:17] take their fire truck away or you take
[54:19] their dowel away from them. I mean, it
[54:21] is the worst thing that has ever
[54:23] happened to them in their life.
[54:25] &gt;&gt; They feel overwhelmed.
[54:27] There is no trust there that I'm going
[54:30] to get my truck back. I'm going to get
[54:31] my dowel back
[54:33] or or you know, I got mom's got this,
[54:36] dad's got this handle. There is nothing
[54:38] there. Their life has just went kapooie.
[54:44] And sometimes people
[54:47] children grow up to become adults
[54:50] and they never mature.
[54:53] And the only way they cannot feel
[54:55] overwhelmed is a situation to be gone.
[54:58] &gt;&gt; It's like they they don't know how to
[55:00] stay there and trust God that he's going
[55:02] to lead him actually out of this. Like
[55:04] how many times does God have to be
[55:07] faithful to us in our trials to realize
[55:09] that God is really going to be there
[55:10] through every one of them? He doesn't
[55:12] have to keep proving it over and over.
[55:14] He wants his children to stand up and
[55:16] say, "I remember the God that did this.
[55:18] I remember when he did this for me.
[55:21] &gt;&gt; Therefore, he will be with me in this
[55:23] situation."
[55:29] &gt;&gt; God allowed this situation that happened
[55:32] to David and it caused David to really
[55:35] call upon God.
[55:38] David was hungry for help. He wanted to
[55:42] be helped.
[55:44] Hear my cry, oh God. Hear my cry. He was
[55:47] crying.
[55:49] Attend unto my prayer. There was this
[55:52] situation that that
[55:56] you know why cry speak. He's here. He
[56:00] knows where I'm going. But yet there's
[56:01] something inside. He felt this
[56:03] overwhelming. And he said, "All the way
[56:05] from the ends of the earth, I will cry
[56:07] if I have to. When my heart is
[56:10] overwhelmed, lead me
[56:13] lead me
[56:16] to the place where I'm not at.
[56:22] It's it's it's it's no longer, you know,
[56:26] I'm in a place that I'm perfectly okay.
[56:30] No, I feel an overwhelmingness,
[56:34] but lead me to the place where I'm not
[56:36] overwhelmed.
[56:38] leave me there. He didn't say, "Take
[56:41] this situation away from me.
[56:44] &gt;&gt; It's not his character. It's not his
[56:45] nature.
[56:48] &gt;&gt; Because if it ain't this situation that
[56:50] we're going to be tried with, it's going
[56:51] to be another.
[56:52] &gt;&gt; It's going to be another. It's going to
[56:53] be another. It's either, you know,
[56:55] coming out of a trial, going into a
[56:57] trial, in a trial. is our life's going
[57:00] to be trials
[57:02] to him that overcomemeth.
[57:05] God was leading David to a higher plane
[57:10] than where he was at. Why this is so
[57:12] important when we're going through
[57:16] things
[57:19] we shouldn't be feeling take this away
[57:23] from me.
[57:27] I mean, Jesus wanted the cup to be
[57:30] passed that he wouldn't have to go to
[57:32] Calvary. If it's possible, let this cup
[57:35] pass from me. I don't want to have to go
[57:37] through this situation.
[57:41] But obviously in that maturity, he said,
[57:44] "Nevertheless, not my will, not the my
[57:47] thoughts, the way my my natural person
[57:49] is looking at this,
[57:51] not my will be done, but your will be
[57:54] done." Amen.
[57:55] &gt;&gt; And it was through that, if you notice,
[57:57] after that is when the angels came and
[57:59] they ministered to Jesus. They gave him
[58:01] grace to go through what he had to go
[58:03] through.
[58:05] &gt;&gt; But it had to go through more agency
[58:07] first. Too often we we live in this
[58:09] natural realm and all the things that
[58:11] we're going through, we just want we
[58:13] just want the thing to be fixed. It's
[58:14] like we don't even see God in our in in
[58:16] in in the situation.
[58:18] &gt;&gt; That is the truth.
[58:19] &gt;&gt; And God is is everywhere. He's he's with
[58:22] his children. Amen.
[58:24] &gt;&gt; If he said, "I I'll never leave you.
[58:26] I'll never forsake you." That doesn't
[58:28] mean he's not leading you to a higher
[58:30] plane.
[58:35] &gt;&gt; I just love the scripture. You know,
[58:37] David didn't say, "Take this thing away
[58:38] from me." I don't want to feel
[58:39] overwhelmed.
[58:41] &gt;&gt; He said, "Lead me to the rock that is
[58:43] higher than I." Amen.
[58:45] &gt;&gt; Lead me to where I am not at.
[58:54] There's a rock for every one of our
[58:56] situations
[58:59] and it's higher than where we're at.
[59:03] There's always a place for each of us
[59:05] that is higher than where we're
[59:07] presently at. No matter how difficult
[59:10] the situation is, no matter how we feel,
[59:12] no matter how much we're overwhelmed,
[59:13] there is a place that God has for us to
[59:17] where we can feel the peace of God.
[59:23] &gt;&gt; And I'll say it like this. It's a place
[59:24] where God is now.
[59:28] &gt;&gt; It's where he's at. He's saying, "Come,
[59:32] come here." Not there. And we're talking
[59:35] about not a literal place. We're talking
[59:37] about a realm.
[59:40] &gt;&gt; We're talking about a spiritual
[59:41] atmosphere. We're talking about a place
[59:44] where we're resting in the word of God.
[59:52] &gt;&gt; He wants us to move up to a higher
[59:55] plane. And these situations that have
[59:58] been created,
[1:00:01] they're so we call upon God.
[1:00:06] God wants us to call upon him.
[1:00:10] Why doesn't he just, you know, God, you
[1:00:12] know, I want this. Do it.
[1:00:17] He doesn't have babies.
[1:00:22] He wants to see character built.
[1:00:26] And we have to be willing
[1:00:31] to go higher than where we're at.
[1:00:34] Not just God, take this away from me,
[1:00:36] but go go higher than where we're at.
[1:00:40] &gt;&gt; Get more mature,
[1:00:42] get get more spiritual, get more
[1:00:44] trusting,
[1:00:46] get um I I've I I know this situation
[1:00:49] and I
[1:00:54] because David could handle the bear and
[1:00:57] the lion, he was able to handle Goliath.
[1:01:01] God's not going to put anything on us
[1:01:03] that we can't bear.
[1:01:08] &gt;&gt; Jeremiah 29 says, "For I know the
[1:01:11] thoughts I think toward you,
[1:01:16] sayeth the Lord, thoughts of peace and
[1:01:18] not of evil to give you an expected
[1:01:20] end." So God's thoughts which are higher
[1:01:22] now,
[1:01:24] &gt;&gt; they're thoughts of peace.
[1:01:27] They're they're a good end, right?
[1:01:29] They're they're not of, you know, you're
[1:01:31] bad, you did wrong.
[1:01:36] So, he's got these thoughts. So, what do
[1:01:39] we do now with these thoughts that God
[1:01:41] has because our thoughts are not his
[1:01:43] thoughts. What do we do? He's given us
[1:01:45] his thoughts. His word is his thoughts.
[1:01:49] &gt;&gt; Verse 12 says, "Then you shall call upon
[1:01:51] me just like David did.
[1:01:54] And you shall go and you shall pray unto
[1:01:57] me and I will hearken unto you. That's
[1:01:59] right.
[1:02:00] &gt;&gt; You shall seek me and you find me when
[1:02:02] you search for me with all your heart.
[1:02:06] &gt;&gt; Lead me to the rock that is higher than
[1:02:08] I.
[1:02:11] If we're not willing to call upon God to
[1:02:14] get higher
[1:02:17] to seek him, he didn't say, "Well, you
[1:02:19] shall seek me and find me when you, you
[1:02:21] know, when you
[1:02:24] say your little prayer, you come to
[1:02:26] church, you give some money, you do this
[1:02:30] little thing, God is looking for all of
[1:02:33] our heart." Amen.
[1:02:37] &gt;&gt; And the more we call upon God,
[1:02:42] the more that God will come and give us,
[1:02:45] I believe, the desires of our heart.
[1:02:51] &gt;&gt; God's higher thoughts for us are
[1:02:52] thoughts of an expected end of peace.
[1:02:57] How do we get there? Just like David
[1:02:59] did. Cry out from the end of the earth.
[1:03:02] Call upon God. just like David did. Seek
[1:03:05] God just like David did. Search for God
[1:03:07] with all your heart and you will find
[1:03:10] God on a higher plane.
[1:03:12] &gt;&gt; Lead me to the rock that's higher than
[1:03:15] he didn't say drag me there.
[1:03:20] &gt;&gt; He didn't say give me the, you know, the
[1:03:22] easy path.
[1:03:24] Give me your word because thy word is a
[1:03:27] lamp to my feet. It leads me to where I
[1:03:29] got to go. We hear the word. We follow
[1:03:32] the word and it leads us higher in
[1:03:34] Christ.
[1:03:36] &gt;&gt; We can't do our thoughts. Our thoughts
[1:03:37] are carnal. Our thoughts are works. Our
[1:03:40] thoughts are I do this, I should get
[1:03:42] this. This needs to be taken care of.
[1:03:44] No. God wants you to stand there in the
[1:03:46] middle of the midst of the fire and
[1:03:49] trust him.
[1:03:52] &gt;&gt; God wants to give every one of us an
[1:03:54] expected end.
[1:03:55] &gt;&gt; He He don't want any of us to miss it.
[1:03:59] And I believe we have to have the faith
[1:04:01] to believe that
[1:04:04] we can't be uh
[1:04:08] I believe it's quite easy for every one
[1:04:10] of us to have old me
[1:04:15] right like I I I think brother Lando you
[1:04:19] should be you should be doing more for
[1:04:21] me
[1:04:22] right
[1:04:24] &gt;&gt; where really the word says we should be
[1:04:26] living for one another.
[1:04:29] Not everybody living for me.
[1:04:32] I don't find that in the word.
[1:04:35] It's find someone and help them
[1:04:40] and don't stop and don't stop.
[1:04:44] God wants to give all of us an expected
[1:04:46] end. Ecclesiastes
[1:04:48] 3:11 says, "He hath made everything
[1:04:51] beautiful in his time."
[1:04:54] &gt;&gt; You talking about an expected end?
[1:04:57] He have made everything beautiful in his
[1:05:00] time
[1:05:02] also. He have set the world in their
[1:05:05] heart so that no man can find out the
[1:05:08] work of the work that God maketh from
[1:05:11] the beginning to the end. So God's
[1:05:13] thoughts are higher than our thoughts.
[1:05:16] His ways are higher than our ways. Man
[1:05:19] can't do it, but God can reveal to us
[1:05:23] what we're to become. Amen.
[1:05:26] &gt;&gt; And it we're it does not yet appear, but
[1:05:29] we know that we shall be just like him.
[1:05:33] &gt;&gt; When he appears, we know that the Bible
[1:05:35] says it. We don't feel it, but we
[1:05:38] believe it. We act upon it. How do we
[1:05:40] get there? Do the things we know to do.
[1:05:42] &gt;&gt; Brother Bam says, "Forget about, you
[1:05:44] know, you want to know more things and
[1:05:46] get more from God, more revelation." He
[1:05:48] says, "You might as well forget about
[1:05:49] that if you don't learn to do what he's
[1:05:51] already told you to do.
[1:05:53] Be real good with ABCs. Be real good
[1:05:56] with ones and twos. And do what he's
[1:05:58] told you to do. No matter how simple it
[1:06:01] may seem, no matter how much you think
[1:06:02] you don't need it, you need to do that
[1:06:04] because he has in his mind to make all
[1:06:08] things beautiful in each one of our
[1:06:09] lives.
[1:06:12] &gt;&gt; God has so arranged it that we literally
[1:06:17] have to call on God for help.
[1:06:23] Psalm 646 verse1 says, "God is our
[1:06:27] refuge and our strength, a very present
[1:06:32] help in trouble."
[1:06:39] I don't know what this is, but you know,
[1:06:41] a lot of times people want to talk about
[1:06:43] the God of prosperity,
[1:06:46] the God that is is great to be just
[1:06:50] worshiped and praised when you're
[1:06:51] feeling good,
[1:06:53] a a a God who uh it just you you get a
[1:06:58] sermon that that just helps you to feel
[1:07:00] better.
[1:07:02] But what about the God who's a help in a
[1:07:05] time of trouble? What about that God?
[1:07:08] &gt;&gt; He He's still God. But the thing is,
[1:07:11] when we're in trouble, we don't think
[1:07:13] about this God.
[1:07:16] We think about how to get out of
[1:07:17] trouble.
[1:07:19] We think we wish the trouble wasn't
[1:07:21] there. We complain about the trouble
[1:07:24] with a lot of things. But what we need
[1:07:26] to do is look to the rock that's higher
[1:07:28] than us.
[1:07:29] &gt;&gt; Look to that rock.
[1:07:34] I want this sermon to be applicable to
[1:07:36] all of us.
[1:07:41] The help that that God has for us. I
[1:07:43] want you to understand it's not here
[1:07:45] horizontally.
[1:07:47] It's not it's not, oh, I need to get
[1:07:49] brothers, sisters to do this for me.
[1:07:52] I'm sorry. The rock is higher than us.
[1:07:56] &gt;&gt; Our our help comes from above.
[1:08:00] Psalms 121 verse1 says,"I will lift up
[1:08:03] my eyes unto the hills from what's
[1:08:05] cometh my help. My help cometh from the
[1:08:07] Lord which made heaven and earth." If he
[1:08:10] made the heaven, he made the earth. He
[1:08:12] certainly can take care of my problems.
[1:08:16] So why doesn't he?
[1:08:19] Why doesn't he?
[1:08:22] Maybe I am not trusting him enough.
[1:08:27] Maybe I'm not believing enough.
[1:08:37] God is calling us to trust him more.
[1:08:42] He doesn't want us to take
[1:08:47] things into our own hands. What happens
[1:08:48] when we take things into our own hands?
[1:08:59] His our thoughts are not his thoughts.
[1:09:03] We may not know
[1:09:06] what God is going to do. The three
[1:09:07] Hebrew children did not know what they
[1:09:09] were going to do when they got put in
[1:09:10] the fiery furnace. We don't know what
[1:09:13] God's going to do. But, you know, we
[1:09:15] made a decision where we're standing on
[1:09:16] the situation.
[1:09:20] And they trusted God.
[1:09:24] Job trusted God. Jonah trusted God.
[1:09:29] He had to get put in a situation, but he
[1:09:30] finally trusted God.
[1:09:34] John 16:7.
[1:09:39] So God is leading us to the rock that's
[1:09:43] higher than us. He's leading us to the
[1:09:46] help that's higher than us. It's not
[1:09:48] horizontal, if I could say it like this.
[1:09:50] It's is it's it's vertical, it's higher.
[1:09:54] David expresses this not lower, not
[1:09:58] sideways. He expresses it higher. So
[1:10:00] just just understand it's it's it's
[1:10:03] upward upward.
[1:10:07] &gt;&gt; John 16:7 says, "Nevertheless, I tell
[1:10:09] you the truth is expedient for you that
[1:10:12] that I go away.
[1:10:14] For if I go not away, the the Holy Ghost
[1:10:18] is not going to come unto you.
[1:10:22] But if I depart, then I'm going to send
[1:10:25] him unto you.
[1:10:28] &gt;&gt; Now, when he comes,
[1:10:31] he's going to reprove
[1:10:34] the worldly nature
[1:10:38] that's inside of you.
[1:10:41] That's the job that the Holy Ghost is
[1:10:43] going to do.
[1:10:44] He's going to show you righteousness.
[1:10:47] He's going to bring judgment to the the
[1:10:50] enemy.
[1:10:51] He's He's He's going He's no longer
[1:10:54] going to have dominion inside of you.
[1:10:58] Now, this is what happens when the Holy
[1:11:00] Ghost comes.
[1:11:02] It all has to do with your nature.
[1:11:08] So, what is he doing? He's leading you
[1:11:10] higher.
[1:11:13] He's leading you to the nature of
[1:11:15] Christ.
[1:11:16] He's leading you out of the low thoughts
[1:11:20] and the well, I'm going to, you know,
[1:11:22] just act like a Christian or I'm going
[1:11:24] to have the the u the the the
[1:11:28] uh form of a Christian and I'm going to
[1:11:31] make you a real Christian. I'm going to
[1:11:33] give you the life.
[1:11:35] Oh, hallelujah. That's what God is
[1:11:38] leading us to do.
[1:11:40] Drop down to verse 12. This is a very
[1:11:43] hard thing for a human being.
[1:11:46] I have yet many things to say unto you,
[1:11:49] but you cannot bear them. Now,
[1:11:53] it is very, very hard
[1:11:57] to have your worldly nature rebuked.
[1:12:04] &gt;&gt; You shouldn't be doing this. You
[1:12:05] shouldn't be at this is the way a
[1:12:07] Christian should be.
[1:12:10] And and sometimes we don't like hearing
[1:12:12] it. And Jesus himself says, "I have many
[1:12:16] things to say unto you, but you can't
[1:12:17] bear them now. You you there's something
[1:12:21] missing in your life that you just you
[1:12:23] know what? I'm offended.
[1:12:26] You know, I can't I just don't ever talk
[1:12:28] to me. Don't talk to me about my kids
[1:12:30] like Don't."
[1:12:34] How be it? Verse 13 says, "When he, the
[1:12:38] Spirit of truth has come, this
[1:12:40] comforter, when he comes, he will guide
[1:12:44] you into all truth.
[1:12:49] &gt;&gt; He will lead you to the rock that's
[1:12:52] higher."
[1:12:52] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:12:57] &gt;&gt; It takes conviction of the Holy Spirit.
[1:13:04] It can't be you listening to another
[1:13:06] human being. Oh, I don't I don't like
[1:13:09] what he said to me. I don't like what
[1:13:10] she said to me. I got offended. That
[1:13:13] bothers me. That's because you the holy
[1:13:16] because the Holy Ghost inside of you is
[1:13:19] not recognizing that God is speaking to
[1:13:21] you.
[1:13:25] &gt;&gt; That's why you need the Holy Ghost
[1:13:28] because the Holy Ghost will allow
[1:13:32] you to be led and guided higher into
[1:13:36] more truth
[1:13:38] &gt;&gt; because the God's job is not just to
[1:13:40] bring you out of Luther,
[1:13:44] &gt;&gt; out of Wesley.
[1:13:47] &gt;&gt; He wants to make he wants to see all his
[1:13:49] image inside of you.
[1:13:53] &gt;&gt; So he just keeps leading you higher and
[1:13:56] higher. Now here's the thing. If he's
[1:13:59] going to guide you into all truth, that
[1:14:00] means whatever he tells you, you're not
[1:14:03] walking in it.
[1:14:06] He's not going to tell you and vindicate
[1:14:08] all the time. The job of the Holy Ghost
[1:14:10] is not to vindicate. You got all the
[1:14:12] truth.
[1:14:14] &gt;&gt; I just want to let you know you got all
[1:14:15] the truth and there ain't nothing you
[1:14:17] need to do.
[1:14:21] &gt;&gt; It you know, but but we can get that
[1:14:24] attitude where I don't know this. I've
[1:14:26] never heard this. I don't feel this.
[1:14:29] Well, that's what the Holy Ghost is for
[1:14:30] is to get you into something you're not.
[1:14:35] &gt;&gt; That's why Brother Brandham could say,
[1:14:36] we come here to find out where we're at
[1:14:38] with God.
[1:14:41] &gt;&gt; Where are we? So, we have to place
[1:14:43] ourselves in in the place that I know
[1:14:47] the Holy Spirit is wants to see me
[1:14:50] higher than where I'm at.
[1:14:54] Now, if I compare myself with somebody
[1:14:56] that's lower than me,
[1:14:58] &gt;&gt; I can feel justified.
[1:15:00] &gt;&gt; I don't need to try. That's a trick of
[1:15:02] the devil.
[1:15:06] &gt;&gt; Or I haven't done nothing wrong this
[1:15:08] week.
[1:15:13] God, no matter how much of the nature of
[1:15:16] God that we have, God wants to see more.
[1:15:20] &gt;&gt; And when I say all truth, I'm not
[1:15:21] talking about all doctrine.
[1:15:24] like we got the message. We got the
[1:15:26] doctrine.
[1:15:28] &gt;&gt; Even the prophet said, "I'd rather have
[1:15:29] the right spirit than the wrong
[1:15:30] doctrine."
[1:15:32] &gt;&gt; So the spirit of God is what leads us
[1:15:34] higher.
[1:15:36] &gt;&gt; It leads us o away from uh uh anything
[1:15:42] that's negatively going on in our life.
[1:15:45] &gt;&gt; Because negative stuff's what makes us
[1:15:46] feel overwhelmed.
[1:15:51] God has an expected end for us.
[1:15:57] We've got to allow the Holy Spirit to
[1:15:58] lead us higher.
[1:16:04] The Holy Ghost has to be the one
[1:16:08] convincing us
[1:16:15] what we need to be doing that we're not
[1:16:17] doing.
[1:16:20] The the Bible tells us how would we know
[1:16:22] that we
[1:16:24] had sinned if we did not have a law.
[1:16:27] &gt;&gt; The law is what tells us whether what's
[1:16:29] right or wrong. Now, if you went to a
[1:16:32] church and if the church all they did
[1:16:36] was try to make you feel good,
[1:16:40] like you don't have to do anything.
[1:16:43] Just put your money in the offering
[1:16:45] plate,
[1:16:47] you know? I mean, you just you're sure
[1:16:49] in is is in. This is all about feeling
[1:16:51] good.
[1:16:54] Like, you don't need the Holy Ghost.
[1:16:56] Then you're you're you're in a man-made
[1:16:59] church. But if you're in a a Holy
[1:17:01] Ghostled church,
[1:17:03] I am sure of it that the Holy Ghost is
[1:17:06] always leading us higher.
[1:17:09] &gt;&gt; Always.
[1:17:12] We read not in the words which man's
[1:17:15] wisdom teaches, but which the Holy Ghost
[1:17:18] teacheth,
[1:17:20] comparing spiritual things with
[1:17:22] spiritual.
[1:17:23] For the natural man receiveth not the
[1:17:25] things of the spirit of God, for they
[1:17:27] are foolishness unto him, neither can he
[1:17:30] know them, because they are spiritually
[1:17:32] discerned.
[1:17:35] But I remember when I first got
[1:17:36] introduced to the Bible and got first
[1:17:39] introduced
[1:17:41] to the message
[1:17:44] and I would hear things and I would say,
[1:17:47] you know what,
[1:17:49] that's crazy.
[1:17:52] Why is that? I was seed, but why was I
[1:17:55] thinking like that?
[1:18:00] Because my thoughts are not God's
[1:18:03] thoughts.
[1:18:03] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:18:06] &gt;&gt; And if I don't get into the spirit of
[1:18:08] God, I'm going to look at everything
[1:18:10] currently.
[1:18:12] &gt;&gt; And and I'm going to look at things so
[1:18:14] currently, Brother Ron, I'm going to
[1:18:15] think I'm a great Christian.
[1:18:18] [Laughter]
[1:18:22] It seemed like the more that Paul got a
[1:18:25] hold of God, the more he realized he was
[1:18:28] nothing. Yes, you have.
[1:18:36] &gt;&gt; So, it's going to be hard for every one
[1:18:38] of us when the Holy Ghost comes and he's
[1:18:40] trying to lead us higher into all truth.
[1:18:43] &gt;&gt; It's going to require a lot of humility,
[1:18:47] right?
[1:18:48] &gt;&gt; The Bible says the humble heard him and
[1:18:50] we're glad.
[1:18:52] &gt;&gt; Jesus says, "I have many things to say
[1:18:54] to you, but you cannot bear it now." So
[1:18:57] when God is trying to lead us higher,
[1:18:59] our natural thoughts is, "Oh, please
[1:19:02] somebody take care of my problem." And
[1:19:04] God's saying, "No, believe in me. Look
[1:19:06] higher and I will lead you up higher."
[1:19:09] We're in the eagle age.
[1:19:11] &gt;&gt; We're the fly above the things.
[1:19:15] &gt;&gt; Because we know our God.
[1:19:18] &gt;&gt; We know our God.
[1:19:20] The problem is people don't spend enough
[1:19:23] time trying to know God.
[1:19:24] &gt;&gt; That's true.
[1:19:26] And then they don't know how to get
[1:19:27] through their trials.
[1:19:31] Trials. Nobody likes trials. Does
[1:19:34] anybody like trials? I see anybody here
[1:19:36] like trials? Nobody likes trials.
[1:19:40] Nobody asked for them.
[1:19:44] But if we focus on our trial, we're
[1:19:47] going to miss the higher rock
[1:19:54] because trials are a negative thing.
[1:19:59] The rock is not necessarily going to get
[1:20:03] us out of our trial
[1:20:07] because like I said, it's it's another
[1:20:09] dimension. We may stay right in the
[1:20:12] middle of the fiery furnace of our
[1:20:14] trial,
[1:20:16] but will not be affected.
[1:20:19] Will not be overwhelmed
[1:20:23] because
[1:20:25] God has led us to a place of trust,
[1:20:29] a place of real peace, real confidence.
[1:20:34] He said, "Come by me, gold tried in the
[1:20:36] fire." Amen.
[1:20:40] &gt;&gt; God is not moved. And when we have
[1:20:42] deity, which is God on the inside, we're
[1:20:45] not going to be moved.
[1:20:47] &gt;&gt; He'll help us. He'll hold us and he'll
[1:20:50] see us through.
[1:20:52] &gt;&gt; God is building his character inside
[1:20:55] each of us.
[1:20:58] He doesn't waste time. He doesn't waste
[1:21:00] situations. He's an awesome builder
[1:21:04] and we build together with him. In other
[1:21:07] words, if we're willing to say, Lord, I
[1:21:09] know that thisi situation has happened
[1:21:12] because you have ordained it to happen.
[1:21:17] It wasn't because, you know, my neighbor
[1:21:19] ran into my fence with his car.
[1:21:23] It isn't because of my neighbor. It
[1:21:25] isn't because of I remember
[1:21:29] um getting a phone call from the
[1:21:34] hospital
[1:21:37] and they told me that my dad had uh
[1:21:41] passed away
[1:21:43] during a very simple
[1:21:47] uh procedure biopsy procedure.
[1:21:50] Just they're going to go in there.
[1:21:52] they're just going to grab a little bit
[1:21:53] of this and just see what it is. And he
[1:21:56] bled to death and his lungs just bled to
[1:21:59] death right there.
[1:22:02] And I remember thinking the thought,
[1:22:07] why did this happen?
[1:22:11] Who who caused the situation? Who was
[1:22:14] the man that missed?
[1:22:18] What happened? remember having the
[1:22:20] computer thought,
[1:22:23] but I never ever put the blame on a
[1:22:27] human being.
[1:22:30] &gt;&gt; Just automatically went, I trust you,
[1:22:32] Lord.
[1:22:34] Everything is in God's hands.
[1:22:37] &gt;&gt; He's the ultimate.
[1:22:41] And I'll tell you, people who blame
[1:22:44] people are never at peace. People who
[1:22:47] blame people are never at peace.
[1:22:51] &gt;&gt; But people who trust in their God, they
[1:22:53] have peace.
[1:22:57] &gt;&gt; Cuz God is their refuge.
[1:23:01] &gt;&gt; And I'm so glad I never battled. I never
[1:23:04] battled.
[1:23:06] God spared my dad's life. I don't know
[1:23:09] how many times. He could have spared it
[1:23:12] again if he chose to,
[1:23:16] &gt;&gt; but he must have been most ready to go.
[1:23:23] &gt;&gt; Philippians chapter 12 or chapter 12.
[1:23:26] There is no chapter 12 in chapter 2
[1:23:28] verse 12.
[1:23:31] We work and labor together with God to
[1:23:35] see our character manifested, which is
[1:23:38] the the character of Christ inside of
[1:23:40] us.
[1:23:41] Philippians chapter 2:12 says,
[1:23:43] "Wherefore, my beloved brethren, as ye
[1:23:46] have always obeyed, not in my presence
[1:23:49] only, but now much more in my absence,
[1:23:52] work out your own salvation with fear
[1:23:55] and trembling." In other words, I could
[1:23:57] be wrong about what I'm doing.
[1:23:59] I could be missing it. I could not be
[1:24:02] where I where I should be, where I need
[1:24:04] to be.
[1:24:07] For it is God which workketh in you. So
[1:24:10] this has to be the Holy Ghost.
[1:24:13] For it is God which workketh in you both
[1:24:15] to will and to do of his good pleasure.
[1:24:20] So he's he's obviously leading us
[1:24:24] higher, more character than what we
[1:24:27] have,
[1:24:28] more giving of ourselves up to become
[1:24:31] more like Jesus.
[1:24:34] &gt;&gt; And he says here, do all things without
[1:24:37] murmuring and disputing. So if you're
[1:24:39] going to do the will of God, do it
[1:24:41] without murmuring. Do it without, you
[1:24:44] know, complaining, without disputing.
[1:24:46] Well, I don't have to do it. I don't
[1:24:48] want to do it. they should have to do
[1:24:49] it.
[1:24:52] Do all things without that.
[1:24:56] If if God is in you, then do his
[1:24:59] pleasure.
[1:25:01] Just do what he tells you to do.
[1:25:06] Why? that you may be blameless and
[1:25:09] harmless, the sons of God, without
[1:25:12] rebuke in the midst of a crooked and
[1:25:15] perverse nation among whom you shine as
[1:25:18] lights in the world, holding forth the
[1:25:20] word of life, that I may rejoice in the
[1:25:23] day of Christ, that I have not run in
[1:25:25] vain, neither labored in vain. We are
[1:25:29] workers together with Christ. If we if
[1:25:33] we are going to just I don't want to do
[1:25:34] that. I shouldn't have to do that.
[1:25:36] I don't think that's I don't think
[1:25:38] that's fair. I think you know that I'm
[1:25:40] not doing that. I'm I am I'm sorry, but
[1:25:43] that's not the way.
[1:25:47] You're not allowing the Holy Ghost to
[1:25:49] work in you.
[1:25:51] You've got to give the right away for
[1:25:54] God to move in your life.
[1:25:56] &gt;&gt; Where the spirit of the Lord is, there's
[1:25:58] liberty. If you give him liberty, God
[1:26:01] will stay there. If you grieve, grieve
[1:26:03] not the Holy Spirit whereby you're
[1:26:05] sealed to the day of redemption.
[1:26:08] &gt;&gt; We've got to allow God to have
[1:26:10] preeminence in our life. Amen.
[1:26:15] &gt;&gt; First Peter chapter 4:12.
[1:26:17] We're still a little bit on trials here
[1:26:21] because it seems like that's one thing
[1:26:22] we got in common is trials. We all got
[1:26:26] them. Every one of us. You know who
[1:26:29] doesn't got trials, James? Who doesn't
[1:26:32] have trials
[1:26:34] uh besides God? He's got a trial. He's
[1:26:36] got to be patient with us. And
[1:26:42] if if I was to
[1:26:45] I was to ask you,
[1:26:48] Brother Ben, who who do you know? Who do
[1:26:51] you know
[1:26:53] that doesn't have trials?
[1:26:56] Okay. But you do know those people who
[1:27:01] don't complain about their trials.
[1:27:05] They stick out like a sore thumb. It is
[1:27:08] those people who look like they don't
[1:27:10] have trials,
[1:27:14] but they got them.
[1:27:16] &gt;&gt; They just don't complain about them.
[1:27:21] 1 Peter chapter 4:12 says, "Beloved,
[1:27:24] think it not strange concerning the
[1:27:26] fiery trial which is to try you as
[1:27:28] though some strange things happen unto
[1:27:29] you. But rejoice, rejoice."
[1:27:36] Now, this is really contrary to our
[1:27:37] thoughts.
[1:27:39] &gt;&gt; Rejoice in as much as you are partakers
[1:27:42] of Christ sufferings.
[1:27:45] Oh Lord, help us to get through this.
[1:27:49] I want to get to Philippians.
[1:27:52] Partakers of Christ suffering. In other
[1:27:55] words, God doesn't put a trial on you
[1:27:58] just because just to put a trial.
[1:28:00] &gt;&gt; He's trying to build character in you.
[1:28:04] &gt;&gt; Character doesn't come without the
[1:28:06] trial. It just doesn't. The prophet
[1:28:08] taught us that
[1:28:10] that when his glory shall be revealed,
[1:28:13] you may be glad also with exceeding joy.
[1:28:16] In other words, you've accepted this is
[1:28:18] the will of God for my life. If you be
[1:28:21] reproached for the name of Christ, happy
[1:28:24] are you. For the spirit of glory and of
[1:28:26] God resteth upon you. On their part is
[1:28:29] evil spoken, but on your part is
[1:28:30] glorified. But let none of you suffer as
[1:28:33] a murderer, as a thief, as an evildoer,
[1:28:37] as a busy body in other men's business.
[1:28:40] So you can suffer doing the wrong thing.
[1:28:44] So that's not the suffering he's talking
[1:28:46] about. So if you're suffering for that,
[1:28:50] you know,
[1:28:53] you you're probably not thinking that's
[1:28:56] strange that I'm suffering that I just
[1:28:58] hit that person
[1:29:00] and he's coming after me with a knife.
[1:29:02] It shouldn't be like a strange
[1:29:04] because you know you caused it. But when
[1:29:07] you didn't cause it and you're going
[1:29:09] through a trial, that's where you need
[1:29:12] to trust God. Think it not strange. God
[1:29:14] is in control of your life.
[1:29:19] Yet, if any man suffer as a Christian,
[1:29:21] let him not be ashamed,
[1:29:23] but let him glorify God on this behalf.
[1:29:26] For the time has come that judgment must
[1:29:28] begin at the house of God. And if it
[1:29:30] first begin with us, what shall the end
[1:29:32] of them that obey not the gospel? And if
[1:29:34] the righteous scarcely be saved, where
[1:29:36] shall the ungodly and the sinner appear?
[1:29:38] Wherefore let them that suffer according
[1:29:41] to the will of God commit the keeping of
[1:29:45] their souls to him that to him in
[1:29:49] welloing as unto a faithful creator.
[1:29:56] Now we all suffer according to the will
[1:29:59] of God. All of us do.
[1:30:02] When somebody doesn't do something to
[1:30:06] you that that that you don't want them
[1:30:11] to do or they shouldn't do or they say
[1:30:13] something or they treat you bad,
[1:30:18] you are now suffering
[1:30:22] as a Christian
[1:30:24] and you have a choice.
[1:30:28] You can be a Christian, act like a
[1:30:31] Christian, bear all things,
[1:30:34] wash their feet, be longsuffering,
[1:30:38] or
[1:30:40] you can let the worldly part of you come
[1:30:42] out. Let them know they have no right
[1:30:45] talking to you that way.
[1:30:56] &gt;&gt; So just commit it to God.
[1:30:58] You know, you'll never you you you are
[1:31:01] never going to change somebody by
[1:31:03] putting them in their place.
[1:31:07] People are who they are.
[1:31:11] You explaining everything and making it
[1:31:13] real perfect. Here's clear. Here's the
[1:31:15] scripture. Here's where you missed.
[1:31:17] Here's what's wrong.
[1:31:19] You know, you you
[1:31:23] you're never going to convince them.
[1:31:24] You're still stuck with seven * 70.
[1:31:29] You're still stuck with having to turn
[1:31:32] the cheek to go the second mile.
[1:31:36] You might as well just accept
[1:31:39] or pray for them.
[1:31:41] Separate.
[1:31:44] Don't engage
[1:31:49] because some people get a spirit on
[1:31:52] them. They literally don't care how
[1:31:54] wrong they are.
[1:31:56] &gt;&gt; They they just want to use you.
[1:32:01] They just want to use you.
[1:32:04] All right. First Peter chapter 1, 1
[1:32:06] Peter chapter 1 verse 5 says, "We are
[1:32:09] kept by the power of God through faith."
[1:32:13] Can you say amen to that? We are kept by
[1:32:15] the power of God through faith unto
[1:32:18] salvation ready to be revealed in the
[1:32:20] last time wherein ye greatly rejoice.
[1:32:23] Though now for a season if need be you
[1:32:26] are in heaviness through manifold
[1:32:29] temptation. So there's many ways that we
[1:32:31] can become overwhelmed.
[1:32:34] One through manifold temptations. just a
[1:32:37] lot of trials going on that the trial of
[1:32:41] your faith it's much more precious than
[1:32:45] gold
[1:32:47] because gold is eventually going to
[1:32:48] perish though it be tried with fire
[1:32:52] might be found unto the praise and honor
[1:32:53] and glory at the appearing of Jesus
[1:32:55] Christ whom having not seen you love
[1:32:58] there's that love again you love him in
[1:33:02] whom though now you see him not you
[1:33:04] believe
[1:33:06] yet believe in you rejoice with joy
[1:33:08] unspeakable full of glory receiving the
[1:33:11] end of your faith even the salvation of
[1:33:15] your souls.
[1:33:19] How many loves the word?
[1:33:21] &gt;&gt; Love the word. Love the word. I want to
[1:33:24] do one more scripture before we
[1:33:27] um dismiss tonight and it's in
[1:33:29] Philippians chapter 3 verse number 10.
[1:33:34] God is leading us
[1:33:39] to a higher place even in the middle of
[1:33:41] our trials
[1:33:44] now in the world. This is how it was
[1:33:45] before I knew God. I just wanted this
[1:33:47] trial done out of my life. Get it out of
[1:33:50] here. Whatever I got to do to stop this
[1:33:51] thing.
[1:33:53] But now we realize that trials that
[1:33:56] happened to us that God has allowed that
[1:33:59] and that he uses the trial to actually
[1:34:02] build our character.
[1:34:04] So it's through that trial that we can
[1:34:07] say, "Lord, lead me to the rock that is
[1:34:10] higher than I."
[1:34:12] &gt;&gt; All right, you with me? Philippians
[1:34:13] chapter 3:10. that I might know him and
[1:34:16] the power of his resurrection and the
[1:34:19] fellowship of his suffering, being made
[1:34:21] conformable unto his death, if by any
[1:34:23] means I might attain to the resurrection
[1:34:26] of the dead. So, I just want to say it
[1:34:27] like this. If you never know God in your
[1:34:31] trial,
[1:34:33] you're not going to know God in the
[1:34:35] resurrection, in the power of the
[1:34:37] resurrection.
[1:34:40] &gt;&gt; Well, brother John, where do you got
[1:34:42] scripture for that? Okay, I'm glad you
[1:34:44] asked. We're going to just cut out of
[1:34:46] here for a second and go to 2 Timothy
[1:34:48] 2:11. It is a faithful saying, for if we
[1:34:52] be dead with him, we shall live with
[1:34:54] him. If we suffer, we shall reign with
[1:34:57] him. If we deny him, he will deny us.
[1:35:01] If we don't
[1:35:03] suffer, we don't reign.
[1:35:08] And Paul is saying, "Oh, that I might
[1:35:09] know him in the power of his
[1:35:10] resurrection, the fellowship of his
[1:35:12] sufferings."
[1:35:14] Now, knowing Christ in the fellowship of
[1:35:16] his sufferings, you're being made
[1:35:18] conformable unto his death. Not my will,
[1:35:22] thy will be done.
[1:35:25] Verse 12, not, now Paul said, not that
[1:35:27] I've already attained.
[1:35:30] Here he is 33 years later after getting
[1:35:32] saved.
[1:35:35] And he's talking like somebody that just
[1:35:39] got converted
[1:35:41] as far as I haven't I'm not I haven't
[1:35:43] attained yet. I just started serving the
[1:35:45] Lord. How many times you hear somebody
[1:35:47] say, "Well, you know, I I'm I'm just I'm
[1:35:50] just a babe in Christ. I just I've been
[1:35:51] I just started serving the Lord.
[1:35:55] Not as I've already attained. Either
[1:35:57] we're already perfect, but I follow
[1:36:00] after
[1:36:02] if that I may apprehend
[1:36:05] that for which also of I am apprehended
[1:36:08] of Jesus Christ.
[1:36:11] So Christ had apprehended him and he was
[1:36:14] reaching for to apprehend Christ. He
[1:36:17] hadn't had that. He hadn't achieved that
[1:36:19] yet.
[1:36:21] Brethren, I count not myself to have
[1:36:22] apprehended, but this one thing I do. I
[1:36:25] forget the things which are behind, and
[1:36:26] I'm reaching forth for the things which
[1:36:28] are before. I press toward the mark for
[1:36:31] the prize of the high calling in Christ
[1:36:34] Jesus.
[1:36:35] I'm pressing. There's a rock that is
[1:36:38] higher than I. There's an image that I
[1:36:42] need to become into. In order for me to
[1:36:45] do that, I've got to forget where I'm
[1:36:46] at. I'm and forget that I'm good enough.
[1:36:50] I'm a good Christian. I'm there. I'm
[1:36:53] gonna work on everybody else.
[1:36:56] I gotta I gotta get where I got to. I to
[1:36:58] be honest with you, I'm going to be I'm
[1:37:00] just going to be completely honest. I
[1:37:01] don't think I have what I need to make a
[1:37:04] rapture.
[1:37:14] &gt;&gt; I'm just saying I got the attitude that
[1:37:15] Paul has.
[1:37:18] I haven't attained. I'm sorry. I haven't
[1:37:20] attained.
[1:37:23] I I believe I need to press.
[1:37:28] &gt;&gt; I believe that's what God want. I
[1:37:30] believe that's what the Holy Ghost wants
[1:37:31] us to do. I mean, if Paul had this
[1:37:32] attitude 33 years later, he writes 14
[1:37:37] books. He's the first uh church age
[1:37:40] messenger. And he still has an attitude
[1:37:41] I haven't attained.
[1:37:43] &gt;&gt; Where does that put us? Where does that
[1:37:45] put me?
[1:37:47] Where it puts me is I need to have a
[1:37:49] humble attitude and press into God.
[1:37:53] &gt;&gt; I press toward the mark for the prize of
[1:37:56] the high calling of God in Christ Jesus.
[1:37:58] Let us therefore as many be as many as
[1:38:02] be perfect, be thus minded.
[1:38:07] So if you're perfect, have this type of
[1:38:09] mindset.
[1:38:11] And if anything ye be otherwise minded,
[1:38:16] God shall reveal even this unto you. He
[1:38:20] just had faith, didn't he? Nevertheless,
[1:38:24] where unto you have already attained
[1:38:26] unto certain things.
[1:38:29] He said, "Have the same rule anyways.
[1:38:31] Let us mind the same thing. and be ye
[1:38:34] followers together of me, and mark them
[1:38:37] which walk also as you have us as for an
[1:38:41] example. I'm so glad that I can look to
[1:38:45] Paul
[1:38:48] for an example. I I don't have to trust
[1:38:50] another man.
[1:38:53] I I don't care how great of signs or
[1:38:56] whatever he could do to prove something.
[1:39:00] H the following he had Paul was so
[1:39:03] humble he said even if an angel come
[1:39:05] preaching any other gospel than what
[1:39:07] I've already preached let it be a curse
[1:39:09] &gt;&gt; he knew that the gospel he preached was
[1:39:11] from heaven
[1:39:14] &gt;&gt; and there is a rock that is higher than
[1:39:16] our situation
[1:39:18] but we have to be humble enough to cry
[1:39:20] out to it
[1:39:22] &gt;&gt; to press in.
[1:39:26] We can't sit around and wait for
[1:39:28] somebody else to do it for us. Character
[1:39:31] will never be molded.
[1:39:34] I'm telling you, the word coming into
[1:39:37] human ears
[1:39:39] is not going to make us into a rapture.
[1:39:44] We've got to have ears of the heart. He
[1:39:47] that have ears to hear, let him hear
[1:39:49] what the spirit is saying, the thoughts
[1:39:52] of God are saying.
[1:39:54] So, we've got to take the word more
[1:39:56] serious. We've got to we've got to come
[1:39:59] to church with this. I'm going to leave
[1:40:00] different. I'm going to leave closer to
[1:40:03] God. I'm going to take the word and I'm
[1:40:05] going to apply it. Because if we don't,
[1:40:08] we deceive oursel. We literally get clo
[1:40:09] further away from God. You got to
[1:40:12] remember there's millions of people that
[1:40:14] go to church.
[1:40:16] Millions
[1:40:18] faithfully go to church
[1:40:21] and are further away from God.
[1:40:27] Thank God that he sent a message to us
[1:40:30] to let us know
[1:40:33] that we're becoming more like him every
[1:40:36] week
[1:40:38] from glory unto glory. The Bible says,
[1:40:40] let's stand together. God bless you.
[1:40:43] There is a rock that's higher than our
[1:40:45] situation. We need to press our way into
[1:40:48] that rock.
[1:40:49] Keep crying out to God.
[1:40:53] I'm going to read two scriptures as the
[1:40:55] musicians come. One is Psalms 18:2.
[1:41:00] It says, "The Lord is my rock and my
[1:41:03] fortress, my deliverer, my God, my
[1:41:07] strength, in whom I will trust, my
[1:41:09] buckler and my horn of my salvation and
[1:41:13] my high tower."
[1:41:16] Proverbs 18 verse number 10
[1:41:21] says, "The name of the Lord is a strong
[1:41:23] tower. The righteous run into it and is
[1:41:27] safe."
[1:41:29] Just like David, lead me to the rock
[1:41:31] that is higher than I.
[1:41:35] Praise God. Let's sing that chorus.
[1:41:37] There is a place.
[1:41:40] There is a place. I
[1:41:47] [Music]
[1:41:54] There is a place
[1:41:58] I go.
[1:42:01] There is a peace
[1:42:04] that I can know.
[1:42:07] There is a joy
[1:42:10] I can attain.
[1:42:12] There is a strength
[1:42:15] that will remain.
[1:42:18] There is a prayer
[1:42:21] that I can pray
[1:42:24] and know the end
[1:42:27] serves on the way.
[1:42:30] Thank you Jesus
[1:42:33] for giving this to me.

[1:42:40] for for bringing victory.
[1:42:44] Thank you Jesus

[1:42:53] I need.
[1:42:55] There is a place
[1:42:58] that I can go.
[1:43:01] There is a peace
[1:43:03] that I can know.
[1:43:06] There is a joy
[1:43:09] I can attain.
[1:43:12] There is a strength
[1:43:14] that will remain.
[1:43:17] There is a prayer
[1:43:20] that I can pray
[1:43:23] and know the answerers
[1:43:26] on the way.
[1:43:29] Thank you Jesus
[1:43:32] for giving this to me.
[1:43:36] Thank you Jesus
[1:43:39] for bringing victory.
[1:43:43] Thank you Jesus
[1:43:45] for providing
[1:43:49] everything
[1:43:51] I need.
[1:43:55] &gt;&gt; Amen. What a revelation in that. What a
[1:43:59] revelation in those words.
[1:44:01] Thank you Jesus for providing everything
[1:44:04] I need.
[1:44:10] Amen. Let's sing Rock of Ages. Cleft for
[1:44:13] me.
[1:44:18] [Music]
[1:44:24] [Music]
[1:44:28] Just clap for me.
[1:44:32] Let me hide myself in thee.
[1:44:37] Let the water and the blood
[1:44:41] from thy wounded side which flowed
[1:44:45] be of sin. The double cure. Save from
[1:44:51] wrath and make me pure.
[1:44:56] My tears forever
[1:44:59] flow.
[1:45:00] Could my zeal no langanger know? Peace
[1:45:05] for sin could not atone.
[1:45:09] Thou must save and thou alone.
[1:45:14] in my hand. No price I bring. Simply to
[1:45:20] the cross I cling.
[1:45:23] While I draw this pleading breath.
[1:45:28] When my eyes shall close in death.
[1:45:32] When I rise to worlds unknown.
[1:45:36] And behold
[1:45:38] beyond thy throne.
[1:45:41] Rock of aes laugh for me.
[1:45:45] Let me hide myself in thee.
[1:45:51] Rock of aes
[1:45:53] laugh for me.
[1:45:55] Let me hide myself in thee.
[1:46:00] Let the water and the blood from thy
[1:46:05] wounded side which flowed
[1:46:09] be of sin. The double cure.
[1:46:13] Save from wrath and make me pure.
[1:46:19] Amen. We have a rock that is higher than
[1:46:21] us. Amen. Higher ground.
[1:46:26] Higher ground. I want higher ground.
[1:46:33] How many is thankful to have the AC?
[1:46:36] &gt;&gt; We've had some trials with the AC. First
[1:46:38] there was this one.
[1:46:40] Then it was that one. Two services in a
[1:46:42] row. But praise God, they're working.
[1:46:46] I'm pressing up
[1:46:50] the upward way.
[1:46:53] New heights. I'm gaining
[1:46:57] every day.
[1:47:00] Still praying. Now
[1:47:03] I'm onward bow.
[1:47:06] Lord, plant my feet on higher ground.
[1:47:12] Lift me up
[1:47:15] and let me stand
[1:47:18] by faith on heaven's
[1:47:21] table land.
[1:47:24] A higher plain
[1:47:26] than I have found.
[1:47:30] Lord, plant my feet on higher ground
[1:47:36] onto scale.
[1:47:39] My heart has no.
[1:47:43] Doubts arise
[1:47:46] and fears dismay.
[1:47:49] Though some may dwell
[1:47:52] where these abound,
[1:47:55] my prayer, my aim is higher ground.
[1:48:00] Lord, lift me up
[1:48:03] and let me stand
[1:48:06] by faith on hand
[1:48:09] and save a land
[1:48:12] a higher plane
[1:48:15] than I have found.
[1:48:18] Lord, plant my feet on higher ground.
[1:48:23] I want to live
[1:48:26] above the world.
[1:48:29] Though Satan's darts
[1:48:32] at me are hurled,
[1:48:35] for faith has caught
[1:48:38] the joyful sound.
[1:48:41] The song of saints on higher ground.
[1:48:45] [Music]
[1:48:51] &gt;&gt; Amen. Grant it, Lord.
[1:48:57] a higher place
[1:49:00] than I have found.
[1:49:03] Lord, plant my feet on higher ground.
[1:49:09] Amen. Amen. Amen.
[1:49:13] &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's go to the Lord in in a word
[1:49:15] of prayer. Our heavenly father,
[1:49:20] we want to thank you
[1:49:23] for the hope that you've given us all.
[1:49:29] That
[1:49:31] there is a higher plane for all of us.
[1:49:37] A place that is above
[1:49:40] all doubts, all fears, all dismay,
[1:49:46] all overwhelmingness.
[1:49:51] Lord, even the things that we've gone
[1:49:53] that we're going through that we've
[1:49:55] never gone through ever before.
[1:50:00] There's a rock that is higher than us.
[1:50:04] And we thank you for being that rock,
[1:50:06] for showing us you are that rock.
[1:50:12] That you're a present help in a time of
[1:50:14] trouble. You are our fortress. You are
[1:50:17] our strength. You're our deliverer. You
[1:50:19] are our healer. You're our provider.
[1:50:21] You're Jehovah.
[1:50:23] You're everything. Lord, we want to know
[1:50:26] you more. We want to know you in those
[1:50:29] things.
[1:50:31] We want to become so attached to you, so
[1:50:34] close to you that we're never moved
[1:50:38] that we're just as solid as can be. Not
[1:50:43] to tossed to and fro, not wondering,
[1:50:48] but we're standing
[1:50:52] upon that solid rock. You said all other
[1:50:55] ground is sinking sand.
[1:50:58] Thank you for placing us our feet upon
[1:51:01] the rock, showing us
[1:51:03] that your word is where we need to be
[1:51:06] standing. And we thank you for the Holy
[1:51:09] Spirit that has revealed to us your
[1:51:12] word.
[1:51:14] The true rock is the revelation of thy
[1:51:16] word.
[1:51:18] And we thank you for it.
[1:51:21] Thank you for keeping us, Lord. We thank
[1:51:24] you for the keeping power of the Holy
[1:51:26] Ghost.
[1:51:28] Lord, and I pray that you would please
[1:51:30] bless each and everyone
[1:51:33] here, everyone that was here, those that
[1:51:37] were listening on the live stream, that
[1:51:40] you would bless their lives,
[1:51:44] strengthen them with more faith.
[1:51:47] No matter what test or trial
[1:51:51] that they're facing, no matter how many
[1:51:53] times they get overwhelmed between now
[1:51:55] and when the rapture happens, may there
[1:51:57] be something inside of them. Just looks
[1:51:59] to the rock, cry out to the rock. May
[1:52:02] they remember that Lord, you are there
[1:52:05] leading them higher above that
[1:52:06] situation.
[1:52:08] Grant, heavenly father,
[1:52:11] we pray, Lord, that you would watch over
[1:52:14] us now as we travel home.
[1:52:17] Travel to our places of abode. Be with
[1:52:20] those that are traveling right now that
[1:52:22] had to leave early. Be with them, Lord,
[1:52:26] on the roads. Be with us. be with our
[1:52:30] our dear sister Donna
[1:52:34] and
[1:52:36] and her and the children.
[1:52:40] Lord, may you bless them with a
[1:52:42] supernatural strength
[1:52:45] from above.
[1:52:47] Oh God, you keep Israel, you can keep
[1:52:50] our sister done.
[1:52:57] Lord, may she feel your love.
[1:53:01] May you keep her, Lord.
[1:53:05] We thank you for all these things.
[1:53:10] Bless this church, Lord. Give us
[1:53:12] strength. Give us strength, Lord,
[1:53:15] knowing we're one less in number that
[1:53:21] added so much to the body.
[1:53:25] was such an encouragement one-on-one and
[1:53:29] the ministry and such an encouragement
[1:53:31] and leading the worship.
[1:53:34] Oh God, we ask that you would be with us
[1:53:38] and strengthen our church. Lord, we
[1:53:41] thank you for this grace. We love you,
[1:53:44] commit oursel to you now. Give you the
[1:53:46] glory and honor for all things. In Jesus
[1:53:48] Christ's name we pray. Amen.
[1:53:51] &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's sing that song. Um, we're
[1:53:54] going to make it as we're dismissed
[1:53:56] tonight.
[1:53:58] We're going to make it.
[1:54:02] We're going to make it.
[1:54:05] By the spirit of the Lord, we'll make it
[1:54:09] through.
[1:54:12] Jesus said he'd make a way. If the
[1:54:16] spirit we obey, we're going to make it.
[1:54:22] all the way.
[1:54:25] We're going to make it.
[1:54:28] We're going to make it
[1:54:31] by the spirit of the Lord. We'll make it
