TRANSCRIPT
========================================
you that we also may have fellowship with us and truly our fellowship is with the father and with the son his son jesus christ and these things we write unto you that your joy may be full amen amen just gonna ask brother ron if he would ask the blessings on the reading of the word today lord amen god bless you may be seated we certainly appreciated um brother ron's great efforts in the worship service today i mean you could just see him doing the job that the holy spirit would lead us to do and to help us all try to get into the spirit because god is a spirit and we need to contact him in the spirit um of course we've all been through tests and trials of some sort and uh if we haven't we're probably are tired i mean there's always something to get us away from entering into the spirit but we must press him and we must get a good ground in order for that word to do us any good amen we know the word's good no matter where it comes from i mean you could just get the bible open it up and read it that word is good but it's got to fall on a good ground amen amen we want to title this showing others eternal life we've been so used to telling people about jesus telling them perhaps about the message but actually showing them it just is kind of opens up a new avenue for us much more challenging but the purpose that we want to share the message with somebody the truth of this word with somebody is that we could spend eternity with them that we could have fellowship with them through eternity that is our purpose and when we do that their joy will become full because in the presence of the lord is the fullness of joy outside of the lord there is no joy there's happiness and it's short-lived brother branham said i would rather someone live me a sermon than to preach me one that was his desire is to see someone live the gospel in front of him and of course when the word is preached we say amen so when we see somebody living the life we should say amen amen to that word and and and shall we say and even in a greater measure because it's harder to live the word showing eternal life or showing the fruit of eternal life is far easier said than done now i'd rather have someone show me eternal life than just tell me about it it is now we've got to find other avenues it forces us our life to become one with the word that we believe just want to say it's come to me like eight times i'm going to say it brother ron's so good to see i want to say amen to what brother ron was saying we certainly miss you when you're not here you're uh a permanent fixture amen amen brother brahm never said eternal life was believing that you have it he never said eternal life was claiming that you have it or even telling other people that they should give their heart to jesus he never said that's what eternal life was he said it's when you're actually living your life for another person's soul he made it real clear but a lot of times we want to make eternal life or our belief of eternal life personal personal definition our personal belief but the scripture is of no private interpretation amen that's why we need the entire bible to understand what perhaps sometimes what one scripture really right means living for others is the result of completely believing christ and following his steps it's a result because eternal life is a free gift most believers feel that it's associated without any kind of responsibility nothing's a nothing you have to do for it because it's free you can't work for it so kind of responsibility goes out the window yet people will fight a war but they won't even think about loving who they're fighting with they will fight to defend their personal belief but they won't fight to lay down their life they're like peter without the holy ghost willing to draw a sword to fight for what they stand for i believe in jesus but jesus said whoa whoa don't do that put the sword up you you you live with the sword you die with the sword we're not of this kingdom here this is not how we do things we're of a different kingdom the kingdom we are live the way we win the war is we lay down our lives for our friends people feel a responsibility to defend their belief and not to win their enemy's soul and we when we're in our flesh we can end up doing the same thing about five years after brother branham went beyond the curtain of time and visited eternity he described what true christianity was and i've read this quote before but again i've decided i want to just take my time i feel if we just say one word that'll help us we've gained something brother branham said in the message a man running from the presence of the lord now brother branham is speaking on a believer's responsibility here he said christianity is an everyday rugged life every day rugged life it's not the end living for god we all have a everyday rugged life but it's usually not living for god it's all the trials we're going through all the things we're we got trying to accomplish but he said it's a a rugged life living for god in this present world so christianity isn't over on the other side it's right here today it's a constant burning of the fire and the love of god in the heart so number one we got to ask the question do we feel a fire burning is it constantly burning that love for that love of god not just love for god but love of god now this is what it'll do it sets you a fire and puts you out yonder with people making converts for christ now i remember selling xango my interest was not to win converts my interest was to get people signed up on xangel sure we want to slide a little bit of the lord in when the opportunity arises but my motive my fire my com my passion was angle and it can be anything right it can be anything we wake up with our goals in life but we ought to be waking up with a fire for converts a love for converts for someone that's not in yet to get to get somebody's nature changed now that's what true christianity is but that is not worldly christianity worldly christianities i'm a methodist i'm a lutheran i'm in the message i'm this i'm that yes i've associated myself with this label it doesn't matter if anything isn't burning in here i love god okay you love god but do you have the love of god amen because we can love god every day and miss it but if you if you have the love of god inside of you it's a burning for converts god didn't say well since i got john martin saved i'm wash my hand i'm all done now i'm not interested no more souls i got john in that's right and sometimes we can have the mentality while we're in we're safe and we miss out on the responsibility that the holy spirit is still moving still moving to get the rest of his family converted the rest of his seed converted they're not in yet that means there's got to be somebody and to go ahead and say well that's really for somebody else to take care of what are you saying to god that you would never go to work and tell your boss i'm not going to do what you tell me to do but i still expect a paycheck from you why would we come to church and hear the word and say that's for somebody else because we're really not taking on the responsibility of christianity so brother branham says responsibilities remember when brother branham says you got to get to the place where you can love everybody even your enemy get to that place get to that spot i think if that we get to that spot we'll automatically care about a soul you won't about to get rid of it that's what true christianity is how many times did we judge somebody because they didn't love us and and they were like a confessed christian they consider themselves a christian and they they didn't love at a certain time and inside you just you just you just judged them that wasn't that's not a christian christians don't do that they don't act like that so we learn not to judge you i might just have the love of god you won't judge it's automatic you don't have to try in fact you lay down your life for the person that's being mean to you and then he shows the contrast of a worldly self-proclaimed christian believer in the rest in this quote here he says but it's easy to go the way the world goes it's easy to flow down the stream just floating with the world easy the way it goes you don't want to do that no sir he says but you must accept your responsibility now of course you got people that won't step foot in the church and i'm not talking about them being the world when god dresses laodicea she's about as worldly as she can be she's so much full of the world that she kicked jesus out of the church and said we'll have church oh we'll have a good time worshiping the lights will go we'll have entertainment we'll have a stage we'll have everything and we don't even need the word so i'm talking about a worldly way of thinking it's easy to be a christian all you have to do is believe isn't it amazing how the angel of the lord told brother brown i like that only belief but yet satan takes that that same word only believe that's all you got to do a christian i only i believe he says no sir but you must accept your responsibility so there comes a responsibility with being a christian with being a believer there's a responsibility everybody you marry there's a responsibility every house you buy there's a responsibility you pay the taxes you cut the grass every job you work there's a responsibility to every believer there's a responsibility the only time there's no responsibility in a person's life is the spirit of i'm going to do what i want to do and that's the nature that you're born with i'm not going to listen to my parents i'm not going to when i get older i'm not going to do that i'm just going to i want to go live off the grid right i don't want to be accountable to anybody the whole world's just a crazy mess so satan has taught us to be our own god because there's no responsibility in that brother branham is describing the worldly view of christianity is easy it's without responsibility to make converts there simply isn't enough love burning inside their heart enough holy ghost to put them out yonder their heart is not set on fire for the lost and i'm i'm just going to say this here saying says you're sitting here i know that you know these quotes and i know that you believe the quotes but i need you to take the next step take inventory because unless inventory is taken you're not going to say lord i want that fire and this is not just something that we want to go home and say lord you know give me add to our prayer request lord give me some more fire we're talking about a whole change we're talking about an everyday rugged life i mean this challenge is so much it challenges me i'm far from where i need to be with this word the man says now you believe it you think it's the truth and the responsibility that god has given us in this day is to bring this message so when's the last time you brought the message to somebody when's the last time you felt that love of god burning you know this message is actually about a quarter of everything that i had written down and i don't think i'm going to get through this quarter because i have decided to take my time that burning is really not you or your thoughts it's something that's been invited inside of your heart in it controls your vessel brother branham taught us if the spirit of beethoven lived in you then you would begin to play like beethoven and then if the spirit of rembrandt was in you begin to to paint like rembrandt so if the spirit of christ is inside of us it will have a burning when jesus looked upon the multitudes he was moved with compassion because he saw them as sheep having no shepherd there was a burning the love of god in his heart that's what compassion is he said as i get older and i know my days are shortening up he says i feel the responsibility greater than i've ever felt and i want you to think about this the older you get the more responsible how do we think in the world the older we get the quicker we retire how many is that like want to retire from this christianity thing it's supposed to take us out of here pressing on he said we must do it we must get down to it everywhere we go tell the message and tell the people that jesus christ is coming amen and that he's god and he's coming soon and there's not a hope left in the world but the coming of the lord so does it really matter who gets in the office i'm not inviting the wrong person in the office and we need to pray for the right people in the office but our hope is in the coming of the lord i just i don't know what it was i think his brother mike he sent me a video and wanted me to watch and i began to to watch it and i don't know maybe it wasn't you no but i was watching the video and this man was just preaching at all the the the the things that the world is doing in the political realms and it was wrong and it's bad and we see satan is in it and we couldn't have all that knowledge of the right and wrong but we need christ on the inside saving souls we need that and any time that you you kind of push it off on the person next to you what are you telling god you're pushing off the responsibility that god is speaking to you when brother branham said eternal life was living for others he never meant doing things for others or just simply being kind to others he meant that when you actually are possessed of it then god gives you a responsibility and your duty bound by god to carry it out paul talked about it in second corinthians chapter five about a ministry a reconciliation that he gives us and it isn't just to restore our own life got this minister i'm going to restore my own life i'm going to make it a great life i'm going to have so much when i'm done with my life it's not about our life brother said the gift is for the other person it's not for ourselves it's for others possessing eternal life ought to make every believer feel so grateful and so unworthy of it that it's easy for god to move us out yonder winning souls for christ but if you don't feel grateful enough you don't feel unworthy then you'll just give to god what's god caesar's with caesar's and i'll take the rest of it i'll give god my time on sunday i'll give him my ties i'll give caesar my taxes my life's my life yes sir is it i thought he bought it at calvary no john he just bought my soul not my body where do you get that scripture know ye not that your temple is the temple of the holy ghost you're bought with a price are we letting god use it god gives the converted believer the responsibility in his own ministry to get the rest of the family together now notice it's not our ministry it's god's he just puts us in his ministry we're just doing what he is doing we're letting him use our vessel kind of like the most uh subtle beast lent himself over to the devil said yeah you can use me we let lend ourself over to god and let him use us beyond our understanding beyond our thinking beyond our feelings our wants and it cannot be accomplished and unless there's a true dying out learning how to die out to the flesh because the flesh ain't going to want to do he's never going to want to do it if you're only willing to fight someone about your belief and not show them eternal life i think it's time to get back to the altar say god fill me with love for others it's you know it's so easy to fight for something you believe just let somebody cross you one time but it's hard when they cross you to love them but how else are we going to show eternal life to somebody anybody can love them that love you [Music] i mean i love brother jason gave me a hat love brother but mark love the person talking about me i mean really love them not just endure their presence but i mean really love them really care about them that's a responsibility to the christian receiving the truth of eternal life will always be accompanied with the responsibility of showing others eternal life to me light shines the greatest during the darkness and if somebody's being completely dark to you completely bad completely mean completely turn offish completely selfish that's the time to really show forth the greatest light because there's so much darkness but that's the time that's the hardest for the flesh because the flesh is just wanting a war against that one to prove the wrong you shouldn't be at you shouldn't you know what don't you know the scripture and before you know it all you're doing is telling them eternal life instead of showing them because remember the letter's gonna kill somebody it's the spirit it's the life that will bring forth life right see the devil uses the word what's he do with it does the same thing to me as he does to all of you which i know he condemns me he must condemn you and he uses the word he doesn't use his own thinking it's hard to receive all the truth that's why jesus said if you can receive it remember he said those words if you can receive it because most people cannot receive all of god's word it's strong jesus said i have many things to say and you but you can't bear it now you've got to wait to there i'm inside of you kind of controlling all the towers right because after the spirit's inside then he can continue to lead and guide you into all truth now if you think about this we know that jesus christ is the way the truth and the life so what else is there to know we know the message of the hour is true and william branham was the messenger of the seventh so what else whether the truth is there think about that our vessels are not totally operating by god and we need all the truth you shall know the truth and the true shall make you free well i've received it i received it i accepted jesus as my savior no he was talking to the jews that believed on him he said if you continue in my word then are you my disciples indeed so there's a continuation there's a continued unfolding of the of the revelation of this word we know the mind of of god is wanting us to move forward into more truth and the devil is continuously trying to convince us that we have enough we have enough responsibility is that true so we we don't mind more of god as long as it's up here knowledge give it to me i want to get dizzy about my head spinning i want to look at things i've never looked at before but where's the life that i want to live that i've never lived before where's that where's that love of god inside see it's always associated with responsibility and the devil is constantly trying to convince us that you have enough responsibility that's why most believers are interested in hearing the word without responsibility they don't mind saying amen to the word where they don't have to do anything jesus says amen jesus not for you amen you ought to lay down your life for one another he always preaches that when's he going to get off the ash heap because it's associated with responsibility and it's easy to sit and hear the word that seems like it doesn't have a responsibility but god inside of us will carry out the work of god so what is the work we should be doing well brother john that's why we come here we come here to find out well eternal life is living for others the fact remains that truth that god wants us to share with others takes responsibility and we can't leave it up to just our mind knowing but our life doing amen if our flesh has anything to do with making the decision we want the easy peasy way smith's wigglesworth said this statement he said that with every revelation comes a responsibility now i love this quote because it forces us to do something with every word that we hear we got to do something with it amen did you ever like know that you you were going to have to do something but you figured well if i don't know about that i'm not responsible for it come on you know what i'm talking about and so you kind of avoid certain things because you know there's a responsibility with knowing something and every time god speaks something to us god expects us to take responsibility with what he told us just like you said in the great commission whatsoever i've commanded you teach it to others there's a responsibility that comes with that amen the knowledge of truth comes without responsibility but the revelation of truth comes with responsibility see the difference there jesus said in the last sermon before he left his chosen disciples he they carried out his commission he said go ye therefore that's matthew 28 19 if you want to write down go ye therefore and teach all nations baptizing them in the only name that's given among men whereby we must be saved the name of jesus christ is the name of the father it's the name of the son and it's the name of the holy ghost a man once said and i don't know him as i tell you his name but he said preach the gospel always and when absolutely necessary use words in other words you can preach the gospel with your life you can display eternal life to others how do you do it you become the word you can't get warm by a pain to fire you can't play with it you have to become it and then it's just natural then you're just instant in season out of season you show them with your life you teach them eternal life verse 20 teaching them to observe all things whatsoever i've commanded you law and with you always even to the end of the world god commanded us to lay down our lives for others so we must be about the father's business saving as many souls as possible because that's what he said here teaching them to observe all things whatsoever i've commanded you you ought to better write a list of x what 100 things that god commands you to do that be safe that's what you should be teaching others well they don't want to hear it is that what he said i'll tell you when the gospel was preached to me i wasn't standing on the front line saying i want here i didn't want somebody telling me i couldn't smoke my dope and drink my beer telling me i had i had to give up my my music i wasn't sitting there waiting for that i wanted to do what i wanted to do but the gospel was preached to me so don't wait for somebody that wants to hear it don't wait for the open door you've got the commission what do you need the open door for when you got the commission well you know they're going to get mad at me if i just do that you mean the same thing's going to happen to you that happened to paul and peter and the persecutions of all the apostles in the book of acts you mean you might lose their friendship stay friends with them all your life and find out where that gets you at the end your friendship is not more powerful than the gospel they need the gospel hey i i'm they're not all going to come but we got to do it to every creature whether he comes or it come amen as you lay down your life for someone else's life you're actually displaying eternal life think about that statement you're willing to give up friendship you're willing to give up your image and your how you look in front of somebody to get christ to them you're actually displaying eternal life when the spirit of truth shall come he will lead and guide you into all truth the bible says they that are sons of god are led by the spirit of god so we believe in the leadership of the holy spirit if the jesus the holy ghost inside of us is leading us he's leading us to teach all things that god has commanded us to observe all things he's leading us to teach that to others because that's what he commissioned them to do and it wasn't just for another age that's just as bad as people believing that jesus doesn't heal that jesus isn't as miraculous as he once was he is the same yesterday to him well his word is the same yesterday today and forever and he's still he's still calling us he's still leading us today in this church right now i believe what's on the mind of god is that he wants us to get out there and tell others about jesus display it with your life find a way to lay down your life when somebody looks at you they go wow that was not a normal thing you know there used to be some shows i don't know if they're still on tv but you know like odd things weird things like i don't know just i can't remember where they're just eating eyeballs or something just like weird stuff and it's weird when somebody don't care about themselves they just care about yourself somebody else's soul that's not the norm brother smith remember brother smith with every revelation comes a responsibility i say with every true revelation of eternal life comes a responsibility a false conception a false understanding always comes without responsibility because the devil doesn't want you to do anything and that's why i say if you can receive it that's why jesus said he that has ears to hear let him hear what the spirit is saying now we hear brother john martin up here talking he's bringing some some points i mean from everything that i'm hearing people in the church are saying amen to the word it's probably the truth that i'm hearing is that a good way of saying that but are you hearing what the spirit is saying to your heart that something dealing inside here the realness that's god with you on an individual basis and that's so by far more important than the words that you're hearing out of my mouth falling in your ears i want to talk a little bit about eternal life last wednesday night i asked the question do you have eternal life and i know most of us felt so offended by that statement [Laughter] and i am not questioning whether you have eternal life jesus never did say the words eternal life is living for others he never said those words or did he or did he let's see here let's turn to john chapter 5 verse 39 we're talking about eternal life for just a little bit here john 5 39 search the scriptures for in them you think you have eternal life but they are they which testify of me so is there a part of eternal life that i'm not living or maybe i'm just missing missing something in my walk that's what i'm trying to get to with this this statement in other words many people think they have it a good trick that satan has placed on many believers is that he convinces them that they have it what happens if if you have your your keys to your car in your pocket there is no need to go searching for them because you have them but what happens brother mark if you lose your keys at our house you go looking for it satan don't want you looking for god doesn't want you looking for eternal life he wants you sitting in that seat so strongly religiously willing to fight to that you have eternal life that you won't go looking for that there's things that are associated with eternal life a responsibility that comes with it the scripture tells us a certain truth about eternal life but yet there's a mystery in this because he said he hid it from the wise and prudent but reveals these truths to who is interested in a real relationship with him there's the difference if you just want eternal life you're in trouble but if you want a relationship with god god's all ears seek and you shall find knock and it shall be open god is here for those that want him but just eternal life without the relationship god doesn't look favorably on that and i know we all start like that and i did i honestly did not want to go to hell but that changes he will lead you to see that he loves you amen that he actually lived for you and died for you and if that same god is inside of us we'll show calvary to somebody else a crucified life is that what paul said i'm crucified with christ i die daily that other people can see the true life of christ in me wow i love the word probably by far the most quoted scripture in the bible probably by far the most mis interpreted as well john 3 15 and 16 that whosoever believeth in him should not perish but have eternal life for god so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son that whosoever believeth in him should not perish but have everlasting life worldly believers or self-proclaimed christians say they believe they'll take that scripture and they'll say it right there i believe i'm saved but does that give them eternal life just because they say believe then why does it seem to give us the right to think we have eternal life because we say we believe the devils believe in tremble because they know they're accurate in their understanding of truth but yet it's not enough to give them eternal life or else should be no need to tremble right perfect love we stand on the day of judgment without fear because that perfect love cast out all fear they do not perfectly love god yet they believe i believe the reason that this is the most misunderstood or misinterpreted is because people usually stop right here when they're searching the scriptures to know whether they got eternal life they stop right here they they're shallow but you know jesus never said search john 3 16. he says he didn't say search the scripture he said search the scriptures they're told to believe and it's easy to believe but what people really need is to be taught how to believe how to believe it's simple to only believe but it needs to be a complete belief and they're making it a partial belief we actually need all the scriptures to get a true clear understanding of what it means really of all of all of all subjects but we need the entire bible to understand the full complete meaning of eternal life and what it means to be saved now i'll say like this if you only got a few minutes before you are going to die and you accept jesus christ as your savior and you mean it from the bottom of your heart you're saved but god gives you another day he expects you to walk in that word that's just the relationship part all right john 7 38 and we're going to just get a little bit more in the scriptures about this he that believeth on me as the scriptures have said out of his belly shall flow rivers of living water now the devils don't have living water flowing out of them and yet they believe so they must not be believing as the scriptures have taught how many times have we talked to someone that believes they say they believe and yet we see something else flowing out of them like you want to you know what i got to get up this i feel uncomfortable i got to get out of this conversation you know what i'm saying but yep they're a believer i mean god jesus the one that told us that he died for us said if we believe properly there's something going to be flowing out of our life it's true james chapter 3 verse 11 doth a fountain sent forth at the same place sweet water and bitter all right i want to answer you're wasting my time up here amen therewith bless we god even the father and therewith curse we men which are made after the similitude of god made in his image out of the same mouth proceed blessings and cursing my brethren these things ought not to be so out of his belly is going to flow rivers of living water not a dead system a living water the scriptures give us understanding of how to believe without the scriptures we don't know how to believe we know to believe the word but we don't know how to believe it we don't know really what it means without those scriptures we don't know how to worship jesus said you don't even know what you worship you don't even know what you're worshiping you don't know how to worship but yet people are worshiping all over the world golf golf worshiping everything in anything worshipping the bottle going to church sitting down and hearing the same old thing over and over and over and they think they're work i'm going to the house of worship but they don't know what they're worshiping god is a spirit they that worship him must get out of the flesh get out of the carnality get out of the i don't feel like and get into the spirit get into the presence of jehovah get into where isaiah was feeling unworthy to be in his house unworthy to hear his word unworthy that he would come down and share his heart with me that's the spirit we need to be in to properly worship and the correct belief is the same way when we believe according to the true scriptures then out of our personal life will flow rivers of love joy peace long suffering gentleness his temperance faith that's what flows out of our life rivers of living water you know who drinks the thirsty you know somebody's acting like a devil acting bad i mean you know just being mean to you you know they're thirsty they're thirsty if they had what you had they would never be doing it but if you don't show them love at that moment you're not going to be long-suffering with them at that moment they're not going to know you got anything he that believeth on me as the scriptures have said out of his belly shall flow rivers so we got to do more than believe like the devils believe we've got to have that life flowing from us amen what else does the bible say about eternal life saint john chapter 6 verse 54 whosoever eateth my flesh and drinketh my blood have eternal life and i will raise them up at the last i think in our bible study last week someone had asked maybe either asked about or somehow we read that scripture and this is a this is a real hard one this is this is no saint john 3 16 scripture who so eateth my flesh and drinketh my blood have eternal life and i will raise them up at the last day brother john is it possible that jesus was kind of giving us an either or you know you either believe and you're saved or you know eat my flesh and drink my blood you're saved no it's the same thing we're just understanding what it means how to believe how to believe we got to eat something got to eat his flesh he's going to drink his blood wow that's crazy how do we do that he died a long time ago it's a whole lot more than just believing oh jesus said in saint john chapter 6 verse 51 he said i am the living bread which came down from heaven if any man eat this bread he shall live forever and the bread that i give him is my flesh which i give for the life of the world so now we've got to eat his flesh brother john you better break this down because currently i ain't getting it well during jesus day they weren't getting it either first corinthians chapter 11 verse 23 for i have received of the lord that which also i delivered unto you that the lord the same night in which he was betrayed he took bread and when he gave fakes he'd break it and said take eat this is my body which is broken for you do this in remembrance of me wow was he was he meaning communion just take communion there are churches out there that believe when you take communion you're actually taking the body of christ did you know that it's a very very carnal understanding of what jesus is asking us in the prayer that jesus taught his disciples in matthew chapter 6 verse 11 he uses these words how we ought to pray give us this day our daily bread but we know it can't be natural bread because he he told us take no thought of what you eat so this is a spiritual bread and his and the bread of god is his flesh and we can eat it every day we need to eat it every day man shall not live by bread alone but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of god whosoever eateth my flesh is actually eating the bible the word of god the bread of life you're eating when you take this word into your life and say i want to live this word you're actually eating jesus christ now if you think you're completely in the image of god then you don't need to read the bible anymore and if you're not reading this awful quiet if you're not reading the bible because you want to become him then we need to put the bible down and pray until we feel that way and then pick it up and read it because we should always be at a place of i need more i need to press in it's a spirit you know we've made it all intellectual and all knowledge and and and we can know all mysteries and know everything the prophet had to say and still not have charity which is i want to be what christ is i want to be what christ is i want to live eternal life you know we see through a glass darkly but we're coming to church so we can see more clearly that's why we come to know how to believe to find out where we're at the entire word of god must be consumed remember the token god told moses don't leave anything for the morning there is no hour after this hour the token for this hour is the complete word of god we are not living in justification we're not living in the age of sanctification we're living in the hour that the bride will become the manifested sons and daughters of god and i'll be honest with you that was the scripture that i started with last week for today's message and it is so far from that i had to just like take it off this whole thing that the whole earth is groaning is waiting for that hour that will become manifested we're living in that hour hour is not for another time the word has come to restore us and it's it's not waiting for us to become scholars with degrees full understandings of of of what we say the message is but it's a manifestation that they're looking for we're not only to eat this bread but ecclesiastes chapter 11 verse 1 says cast thy bread upon the water for thou shall find it after many days give a portion to seven and also to eight for thou knowest not what evil shall be upon the earth so when's the last time you went out and gave the word to eight people well brother john i didn't come to church to have you preach that to me and if you stay in the scripture very long i'm going to go out of here with my countenance sad thinking it was another bad service come on you've got to fight the flesh when you're challenged with the word the flesh isn't ever going to be you know so good that it did it so you don't listen to the flesh you just say lord i just heard from you you want me to go out you're reminding me you're bringing things to my remembrance of what you want me to do you're stirring my mind up by a way of remembering i've got to give this word out to eight people give it to seven and then to eight this is showing eternal life who so eateth my flesh and drinketh my blood have eternal life the words that i speak unto you they are spirit in their life the bible left alone in word form is of no prophet the bible says the letter killeth but the spirit of the word is the holy ghost which gives us life and we as as we believe the word of god and it becomes real to us it will become manifested inside of us i'll say it like this we're here getting more than information we could be here just getting information but we could be here desiring the word to come real to us and come inside which is the holy ghost in spirit form it's the word of god in spirit form did you know that jesus had a split in his church when he was when he walked he had a church and believe it or not jesus had a split in his church and the majority of the people left it wasn't split down the middle but the majority left and you could read all about it in st john chapter six so he and they all left he turned towards his his 12 chosen disciples and he said are you going to leave too now why did they leave why was there a split in the church because he began preaching what it means to believe what it means to have eternal life and it became harder and stronger and they didn't want to hear it and they left and he was he was just like he turns he says are you going to leave also and then peter said to whom shall we go thou alone has the words of eternal life people don't mind going to church if they're getting what they want how many times you talk to somebody you ask them why they go to the church they go to what they like about the church and they will never tell you because the word of god the revelation of the word of god is setting me free they'll never say that it's all about how appealing it is to their flesh how they enjoy the music how they enjoy the laughing yeah some of them like the casuality that you can bring your coffee right into the sanctuary yeah right you know it just everybody just they just everybody just kind of like talks to everybody in the sanctuary this is a really good time it's nothing about a nature change because a nature change requires dying out it hurts and eternal life it's the opposite when we receive eternal life we lose our life our nature our nature our old nature our selfishness and we literally live for others amen can you bear with me just a couple more minutes yes thank you saint john chapter 10 verse 27 my sheep hear my voice i know them and they follow me and i give unto them eternal life and they shall never perish neither shall any man pluck them out of my hand so jesus never said the words eternal life is living for others but he did say eat all my word teach others to do the same whatsoever i've commanded you he did say feed my sheep he did say wash the dirt off of other people's feet he did say love one another exactly the same way that i have loved you and how do you love us when we think about it he died for us he forgave us and now we got to go love somebody else the same way he did say no greater love that we could have than when a man lays down his life for his friends so he didn't say those words quote as the prophet said but when brother branham makes the quote eternal life is living for others he's summing up what jesus said in the bible show others eternal life show others eternal life live for them and not their body don't live for them naturally don't give them something that makes them happier makes life easier for them i mean these are good gestures and christians should do those things right but don't misinterpret live for the person soul you're talking to when you're talking to somebody think about their soul think about where it's at and where it needs to be it's not about friendship that's right anybody that knows me knows if you spend any time with me it ain't very much long before i'm dealing with their soul because anything else is going to pass i know that you know there are there are times that that either people have needs or people need to vent or the people things happen but our goal needs to be help their soul and you all have the ability to do that all of you here every single person in this church has the ability to do that amen i say today that if you're not living for others the same as the scriptures that taught us then i'm sure that the shepherd's voice is speaking to you today to follow that to follow him he's leading you to do this because my sheep hear my voice and they follow me if we had one week to live would you be that interested in making sure your grass got cut you got your car paid off finally got your room clean that was to me no we'd be thinking about those that would possibly be out of america's safety one week that's right [Music] so is jesus coming soon to you see i believe the spirit is leading us to go display eternal life to others now we that have the holy ghost we that have the seed of god in us today we that have the treasure in our earthen vessels jesus the good shepherd inside of us is leading us to do his perfect will so i'll say hear him this morning as he's leading you to live for others for the souls of others henry ford and i'm closing henry iv said the true measure of a successful leader is their ability to discover the hidden talent in those that lead and challenge them to achieve greatness now i want you to think about our good shepherd jesus he's a good leader he knows there's a treasure inside of us we have him and he is leading us to achieve greatness saints i say as your pastor i see hidden treasure in you a treasure that it doesn't matter what persecution that you can help others without the fear of losing your own life losing your what you want to do without the fear of a persecution or affliction or or being so much in despair that you have this treasure in you and that you do have the ability of greatness and i have no other knowledge of greatness than for you to save one soul that's worth ten thousand worlds what greater thing could that be there is nothing greater we've just got to be willing to yield to what's inside of us it's there we believe it you to it to whom you yield yourself servants now i'll tell you i i'm so sick of the devil [Music] he tricks me does he trick you he can't get us to say hey come on over here i'm the devil he lies to us he tricks us to live for herself to live a selfish life to have everything be about me myself and i i hate it i hate him hey man let's stand to
