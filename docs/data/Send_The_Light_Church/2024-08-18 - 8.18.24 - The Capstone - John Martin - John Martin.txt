cleaning for all your dedication to making it a great blessing for each of us amen amen now let's stand together for the reading of the word this morning and we turn to the book of Zachariah chapter 4 and I wanted to if I could just start the first verse I I know that I made mention to them in the back just two verses but I want to read the first seven verses there amen amen let's just look to the Lord in a word of prayer before we begin begin to read dear father we thank you we thank you for calling us Lord out of a world of sin that we could come to know you in a in a personal way a way that would literally change our very nature and it would change us not into just something from one pig to another or from one thing thing to another but to change us into the same image of our creator our heavenly father oh God we will forever be in debt to you amen this morning Lord with the scriptures we're crying Grace Grace we thank you for your Amazing Grace Lord would you come this morning in the revealing the unveiling of your word and just speak to each of us individually Lord Lord show us that next step that we need to take that we might become more like you Lord let us leave uh the church after a fellowship with just being drawn closer to you we just pray your blessings upon it all we thank you for these things for we ask them in Jesus Christ's name amen amen amen Zechariah Chapter one and the angel Tau with me uh and the angel that talked with me came again and wake me as a man that is wakened out of his sleep and said unto me what seest thou and I said I I looked and behold a Candlestick of gold with a bowl upon the top of it and his seven lamps thereon and seven pipes to the seven lamps which are upon the top thereof and the two olive trees by it one upon the right side of the bowl and the other upon the left side thereof so I answered and spake to the angel that talked with me saying what are these my Lord the angel that talked with me answered and said unto me knowest thou not what these be and I said no my Lord then he answered and spake unto me saying this is the word of the Lord unto Zer this is the word of the Lord unto Zer rubbable saying not by might nor by power but by my Spirit sayeth the Lord of hosts who art thou oh great Mountain before reable thou shall become a plain and he shall bring forth The Headstone thereof with shoutings crying Grace Grace unto it amen amen you may be seated amen we want to entitle this message the cap Stone so good to see brother Marty oh my we've missed you brother Marty so good to see you glad that you're able to have that time uh time is important to staying healthy you got to just have some time to unwind from life well this Capstone is a headstone the best way to to visualize a Capstone is to visualize the very top Stone of a pyramid amen and Jesus Christ is the Capstone he's the headstone of the church and of course this prophecy speaking of of Christ's coming the message is this the sign of the end times sir brother B says and now the headstone comes to cap off the church we know that God is building his church upon the revelation of himself who he is for he said Flesh and Blood have not revealed to you who I am but My Father which is in heaven and Upon This Rock I will build my church and the Gates of Hell shall not Prevail against it Jesus spoke in in Matthew chapter 7 there verses 24-7 about the the two foundations and and one Foundation is the word of God and if we build our house Our Lives the way we think the way we live our our Ambitions our goals upon the word of God then we will be built in such a way that when the storms of life come we will never be shaken right but if we choose to put all to to use only part of the word then you're actually building your life upon sand because sand is just a the same thing as a rock right it's just little parts of a rock but it's not it's not it's not the total thing and and God will only honor if you take the whole word right live by the whole word word so we the foundation has to be the word of God and if we build our life on that Foundation the Bible darely uh tells us that no matter what happens we will be able to stand the test of times and the message dedication brother bam says but the real church is built upon the revelation of the word and the will of God Amen now Jesus is not only the the Capstone but he's also the the Cornerstone and I think Brother Bruce shared a little bit of this some time ago but in Colossians 1:18 the Bible says Jesus is the head of the body the church which we know is the Capstone who is also the beginning the firstborn of the Dead that in all things he might have the preeminence am so he's the beginning he's the end he said in uh Revelations 1 ver8 I believe I am the Alpha and the Omega I'm the beginning and he is the whole church building amen amen Ephesians 2:20 says we are built upon the foundation of the Apostles and the prophets Jesus Christ himself being the Chief Cornerstone amen amen I'm so glad that we have a Bible amen that declares to us the foundation amen am praise the Lord first Peter chap 2 ver4 and we just want to talk about where where're Jesus is not only the the first stone but he's the last Stone all right 1 Peter chap 2:4 says to whom coming as unto Lively Stones we've read this this allowed indeed of men but chosen of God and precious amen that's Jesus Christ amen disallowed by men I mean he he came to Jerusalem he came he he rode down the Mount of Olives on that that uh cult and and um uh Jerusalem rejected him but there were others who received him amen so disallowed of of some but chosen of God you also as Lively stones are built up a spiritual house so we are part of the building that God's making think about that amen he chose us to be one of the blocks that's right amen I I just love that thought that that I I I and you know what he doesn't take us as we are he starts with what we have and he says you know your soul it needs to be changed to fit the building amen and he changes our character and so so we this is why we come to churches is so we can become more like Jesus amen so we're buildt up a spiritual house a holy priesthood to offer up spiritual sacrifices acceptable to God by Jesus Christ so you you understand that not all sacrifices are accepted by God not all praise a amen amen they that worship me they they must it's a must deal you must worship me in spirit and in truth you you just it just the only way so when it's coming from your heart and you mean it I'll say like this your praise can be perfected amen I think we just need to get back to the Simplicity that God I owe you my life amen wherefore also is contained in the scripture behold I lay in Zion a Chief Cornerstone he's elect precious and he that believeth on him shall not be confounded unto you therefore which uh believe he is precious but unto them which be disobedient the stone which the builders disallowed the same is made made the head of the Cornerstone so you know we are we are all Builders we all got a house and sometimes we don't want to allow the word of God into our life and it's a choice God gave us all that choice I I I think about the great choice that Lucifer had and for I don't know how many years that he literally kept order inside of heaven and was sincere and worshiped God until he decided that his will should gain some some freedom of its own and then he started given the idea to the other angels and then they gave the idea to to to uh and then before you know it everybody that was born had the same idea amen and we got to come to the conclusion that that God deserves his will because he's the Creator you know he he's he's the he's the Potter we're just the clay not my will thy will be done but we have a choice in how we're going to be built but he is he is made the same that was the Cornerstone disallowed is now made the head of the Cornerstone so the Capstone so when we build a house we have to lay a foundation and that we build on top of that am and the spiritual building for the Christian is the character or the divine nature of God so we must take steps and I I got this uh uh this beautiful uh picture here that's donated by Brother johnon here um of the Statue of a perfect man and uh you you build everything based on believing the word of God Amen God honors your faith without faith it's impossible to please him you cannot develop or um um I say develop because uh these these things come into our life by God by Revelation by you believing that Therefore your life even though maybe you've been not patient or you you don't feel you've got strength or you don't feel you have that that brotherly kindness but but because you believe you're a part of God that you can have these but you don't you don't want to be focusing on this if you're struggling down here and I wish I had time I I thought about building all these blocks out of wood and and and and switch them and show you you know it wouldn't it wouldn't be the right building it just one work so there's a there's a reason that it's like this and we we've gone through this but we're just going to keep on on this this this theme hopefully cap it today second Peter chapter 1 second Peter chapter 1 verse number three according as his divine power now it has given unto all of us all things that we need that pertaineth unto life and godliness through the knowledge of him that called us to Glory and virtue whereby are given unto us exceeding great and precious promise that's why we need to read the Bible right there we need to read the Bible we need to claim see that word that word is for you you need to claim it right that by these precious promises we can be partakers of God's divine nature having escaped the corruption that is in the world through lust and besides this giving all diligence add to your faith virtue virtue knowledge and to knowledge Temperance and to Temperance patience and to patience godliness and to Godliness brotherly kindness and to brotherly kindness we see the Capstone the Capstone which is Charity right and we know that is God that is not human love that's the love of God the last Stone which is the cap stone is Charity it is the love of God God is love so we could say it like this the last Stone which represents Revelation the last Revelation is perfect love are you coming with me you it's not it's not I I don't want this to be be deep but our life gets capped off our character I'll say it like this the character is capped off with perfect love that's who God is he's perfect love yes he has the ability to do all these things and he can bring the the different characteristics of who he is into our life that we can begin to manifest it but the greatest revelation of who Christ is is love he's the Capstone the Capstone is when the Holy Ghost caps off our character with Divine love agape love all these virtues are God's divine nature amen now what is the last one brotherly kindness no it's not the last one so we when we think about being kind to one another treat one another right that's not the end there's something greater than that oh God come and cap our lives that Capstone is when the Holy Ghost caps off our character with Divine love we don't cap we don't cap at oursel we cannot we cannot go like this the prophet taught us to go like this you understand we go up he comes down but if we don't go up we don't build it's not coming down right because the Capstone doesn't get placed on everybody that's God's choice am but if we walk up seven steps to Perfection if we keep building if we keep adding if we keep being conscious I want the character of God in my life I want to be like Jesus and you you pray and you seek Him you read your Bible and you you mean business with God I know we live in a world that's full of problems I understand that but look we it don't matter if all the problems were resolved you still got to make a decision am I going to put God first in my life right and I I believe that decision can be made right now all you got to do is set everything else aside in your life and just purpose in your heart God I want to put you first that's it that's that's is so simple Amen in the message the seven the seven uh seventh week of Daniel uh NOP 70th week of Daniel brother BR says he is the holy spirit right and the cap of the pyramid will be the coming of Christ amen think about that see he comes down catch us away but just like you know the the Bible says um the the shout will go forth um the dead in Christ shall rise and there there will be a meeting in the air we know the shout has already took place so the the Rapture is is already in progress It's already in progress and and and I know we're looking for the culmination but this is this is our our training period this is our time to to show God that I really believe in your coming and and that I'm a part of the catching away and that's because we're we're taking time to be serious with the word of God Amen right now the love of God the Bible tells us is shed abroad in our heart by what the Holy Ghost so if you want more of the love of God more of the Capstone just seek more of the Holy Ghost you can't have the Holy Ghost and not love it's a different ghost it is and and to pray for the pray for more love of God and not have the Holy Ghost you're just praying for more human love and that has stops and starts and stops amen so the Holy Ghost caps off our character with Divine love as I've said so when we're when we when we're baptized When We believe We repent we get baptized that's showing God that we believe amen that is the foundation it's the it's the first step of building is believing the word of God just moving forward wherever you're at so if you're a sinner repent get baptized okay yeah you've done that you you come to church you're hearing the word of God you hear a lot of things right being preached but one of them like goes like this you whoa that stuck out more than any of the other ones that is God speaking to you amen and when you hear that you just you move on to that step even if it don't make sense that it has nothing to do with what's going on in your life it is what God is wanting you to do and if you do that that's you building on the right foundation because he reveals to you what to do and it it it may not be some strong shaking where you're thrown across the church it may be a still small voice but it's still his voice and and that that's what's what's important so we're adding step by step we're adding to our faith virtue strength I'm just being faithful you know the more you come to church the more you read the more you pray especially the more you pray the more you pray the stronger you get spiritually that's just all there is to it you men ought to pray always and not faint right because when you're not praying you become weak you become spiritually shriveled up so you you you you really focus on on on on praying and you'll get uh more strength more more virtue you be to handle more you'll be to do more because God is in you to do it amen amen then you you just keep building these right here now brother brandom had said when you repent and get baptized it shows you've accepted Christ but it's not until you get filled with the Holy Ghost that Christ has accepted you that's a powerful statement because you know with any you know denominational believer they're going to say well no Christ accepted me when I repented yes he did then but not for a Rapture you've got you've got to go on and get sealed with the Holy Ghost can you say Amen to that first 1 Corinthians 12:13 says for by one Spirit are we all baptized into one body whether we be Jews or Greeks whether we be Bond or three we''ve all been made to drink into one spirit so we must keep building until the Holy Spirit caps off our life with Divine love right amen Divine love well when we're building a a building we never start with the roof right the roof is the last thing and you know just any building when you look the the the roof kind of overhangs the building right a house if I could say it like that very seldom do you see a roof that doesn't overhang it go it's got to overhang a little bit The Roof is the last thing it it covers everything and it's really no different with a Christian wolf not a wolf but a roof yeah and you you know what I'm saying I know you know what I'm meaning anyways charity is the last thing that's put on because it covers a multitude of sin in your life in other people's life you know if you don't have love you can't forgive somebody it takes love to forgive amen because our love is still holding things against people right and that's why we need God to come and cap our our our life with his love amen when God comes down and he seals the bride with a goppy love says she's my bride now the Christian Man does not seal himself he doesn't cap himself no what he does is he is diligent to keep adding Faith virtue knowledge to his life and and if he can walk up these steps and get here God sees he will come down and cap our life with Divine love because he's faithful he wants to he wants to marry a bride without spot without wrinkle with any such thing he just he wants to love her and he wants to be loved reciprocate that love back right right yeah God loves everybody unconditionally right absolutely he just loves unconditionally he even loves his enemies he's good to them that that don't work good to to him I mean he that that one guy came to to kill Jesus and his ear got caught up in Jesus didn't say hey it goes to show you you shouldn't come after the big guy he didn't say that amen he picked up the ear he touched him and he healed him and who knows that that man still could have went to his grive hating Jesus right but when that Divine love comes into our life we will love just like he loved and he comes down and caps the believer with that same love so we don't have to have confidence in ourselves our confidence is in God that he'll do it because we're still on the same Foundation of faith that God will do it for us amen amen God has to make sure as brother bandam said that the Box Car it has to be all packed perfectly because if you know if if if these are out you know I got all these except this well then God is not going to you he's not going to say well you tried you got the you you know you got the the majority of them you know you're in I can't find scripture for that am so I say you just get serious with the word and you pray and say God I want your character now these are these are not dos and don'ts by the way this is just simply God's character we're not born with it but we are born again with it amen now we cannot enter into heaven without being bornn again or the new life we cannot enter into heaven I'll say without perfect love we cannot enter into heaven without the Capstone are you with me all right brother B said in the message beyond the curtain of time he says I noticed these young women all wore their hair down to their waistline and their skirts went down to their feet and after this hope my first wife she hugged me and said my precious brother then another young woman hugged me and hope turned and hugged the young woman and I said I don't understand this that means brother brandham was looking at the situation through human love am because they were in perfect love and he's looking at it in human love says I don't understand this this is something entirely different from our human love he says I don't want to go back to that old body in the bed and anybody that's ever went over there and came back said I don't want to come back then a voice spoke to me and said this is what you preached amen that the Holy Ghost is so when you're you're listening to 1100 sermons that he preached he is really preaching perfect love now he only named a few Services perfect love divine love or love compared to everything else he preached but understand in the message that he preached which is the word of God unveiled it is the it is it is to uh introduce the Capstone to us to our lives the word of God is perfect love God's word is perfect love and that's why it's so important to follow it because it shows God you love him he said if you love me keep my word amen amen he said this is what you preached that was the Holy Ghost this is perfect love now the voice is still speaking he said this is perfect love and nothing can enter here without it I think about those Cher they're just guarding I'm telling you Saints don't try to enter in because you think you're special you you got to get perfect love this is is as as sure as anything I know this this type of message is not preached in the denominations but you know what God hasn't called you to the D he's called you out of the denomination he has called You Into His Marvelous Light amen and the rejected King brother says and I Heard a Voice then that spoke to me that was in the room and said this is what you preached was the Holy Ghost this is perfect love and nothing can enter here without it so he he says it in two different messages say but he says this in this one he says I am more determined than ever in my life that it takes perfect love to enter in there so up till this point in 1960 he says I'm more determined now than I've ever been in all my all that I've ever went through that it really takes perfect love to Ender there now if we if we can just believe that then now you can pursue it right amen but if you think somehow it just happens it don't just happen you got to prepare yourself for it right it it's just like it's just like getting filled with the Holy Ghost God is not going to come just because we repent to got baptized and fill us with the Holy Ghost it's not that's not how it works there's a process of sanc ification that takes place to where God begins to deal with your desires your dos and your don'ts and what you want to do and where you want to go and and you start kicking out certain things out the way you talk the way you act and you know what you want to do with your time and where your heart's going brother BR says it's really easy to know where you're going he says just see what you're being drawn to where you spending your time what you're being pulled to so you go through this process of of of sanctification and then he comes and fills you so it is no different when we view the cap Stone coming down on our lives we have to have things in order in the message beyond the curtain of time brother R said there was no jealousy there was no tiredness can you say Amen to that this morning we should better say Amen to that one he said there was no sickness you that are sick today those of you that are not here you can say Amen to that no old age amen we a lot can say that Amen to that one no death only Supreme Beauty and joy what a word what a word that brother B used whatever you do he says now lay aside everything else until you get perfect love now I know I've read these quotes here but look I don't know if we're really laying things aside to go after it so I just ass soon stir up your your your remembrance your stir you up by way of remembrance this is what the prophet said uh we we we've we've got to lay things aside what things is he talking about what do we lay aside to get it well are there things in your life that are not these are there things in your life that are not these hey let's lay it aside let's lay it aside maybe maybe we're not putting enough time just saying Lord I I know that I need perfect love amen I'm just going to I'm going to lay aside my time that I've been doing other things and I'm just going to seek more of the Holy Ghost see the Simplicity in this it's simple but it is really profound and it brings forth a fruit in our life because God is he can't help us other than going through free more agency right he he he just can't he can't bypass you know because we understand we all have mixed motives we all want and don't want there's a white dog in the black dog there is I want to do my will I want to do God's will all of us and and and we've got to get to the place where we lie lay aside the other things that are not God's Will and seek perfect love if if we just if we if we just promis in our hearts to do that we can stop church right now we literally could stop right now have fellowship and go home because this is what brings God to you it's like it's like a a magnet right he he's drawn by love the love that you have for God the love that you you have to want to please God he's drawn to that and and and and he's coming for those that look for him and is appearing he's not coming just because well I'm just coming for everybody that says they're in the message he is not coming for themen just like he didn't come he didn't everybody that came out of Egypt didn't go in the promised land I mean they all profess to be believers they all profess to love God they all profess you know they all Rejoice yeah he brought us out of Egypt look at my shoes never wore out for 40 years they all could testify of that but that just testifying of how great God is how loving God is how perfect God is he's good to the the just and the unjust but it it it doesn't prove where they're at because they they they didn't say we're more than able to take the land it was only Joshua and Caleb they stayed on that Foundation amen all right lay aside everything else until you get perfect lib get get get you you've heard somebody say get out right we we've all heard that get brother Brandon says get to where you can love everybody get there I I love the holy ghost pulling me there I do I do where would we be without the Holy Ghost he's there to lead and guide us into all truth get to where you can love everybody even your enemy no matter if the plane is rocking the lightning is flashing or The Guns of the enemy are upon you these things things do not matter get perfect love in other words it really doesn't matter what's going on in your life it doesn't matter if the wars are going on it it doesn't matter if you're in a plane and it's it's looks like it's it just nothing matters you you got to stop making excuses come on who's got enough Holy Ghost to say Amen because that's what the the Holy Ghost says Amen to every word of God and look God knows you know what we're bad on but he he he's more interested in where you're standing right are we going to stand with God are we going to love him or we going to say I I can't right now you know I can see where that woman when she gave one pence in the offering she gave more than anybody else so if you got whatever you got to to get perfect love to seek perfect love use that to get it because God is looking at that to see how much you're you're given you you understand what I'm saying don't wait till Everything Is Beautiful believe that everything's beautiful right here right and and and and that you are just going to put God first in your life I you know perfect love is is a it's a it's a paradox amen it it is the easiest thing to receive it's the easiest thing to receive and yet it's the hardest thing to give that's why it's a paradox because to receive it you don't got to do nothing you don't got to die out you don't got to become better you don't got to turn the cheek you just say Lord give it to me I love it love your presence but yet it is the hardest thing to lay down your life and love somebody more than yourself why it's a paradox that's where we have to lay everything aside get to the place where we love everyone even our enemies you know it's the same thing that Jesus said when he said now you love you love a new commandment I give you you love one another as I have loved you right he said the same thing he said get you know you had to have perfect love now towards one another Jesus taught this Capstone in the Beatitudes when he said in Matthew 5:48 be perfect be therefore perfect even as your father which is in heaven he's perfect and then I'm just I'm going to switch it up here and go to verse 46 for if you love them which love you what's your reward do not even the publicans the same if you salute those that you want to salute what more what do you more than others in other words God is not going to cap that that's not what he's looking for in a wife he's not looking for someone that loves them when they're being loved being kind when they're being kind too he ain't going to cap that he's viewing that is you're the same as everybody else takes no effort to receive the Capstone of perfect love when God comes and caps you but you know God's going to say I'm going to give you a a little bit I'm giving you a little bit of Holy Ghost I'm going to give you a little bit of love I'm going to give you a little bit of my word and I'm going to put you in a situation and I'm going to see can you handle this right and if you're able to forgive and love this little thing right here you're showing me you've got character you know what I'm going to give you more love but you if you can't be faithful with a little you're not going to be faithful with much so he's not going to give much and here's the beautiful thing about God he will not lay anything upon you that you cannot handle that you cannot bear so if something just seems I've heard this statement so many times from so many people I can't take it anymore I can't stand I can't I what what what give me the scripture on that one that's calling Our God Unfaithful and I know you would never do that God is faithful amen things seem overbearing things seem hard things seem difficult but they do because we get away from the word which is our strength which is our faith which is our confidence I mean Joshua and Caleb they weren't looking at their muscles they weren't building out the their muscles in the gym for four weeks for four months or 40 years before they went into the promised land they just trusted in a God who made the promise amen they'll take care of them so he says Jesus said verse 44 but I say unto you love your enemies yes bless them that curse you do good to them that hate you I I have to make him something and give it to him I have to I have to put my arm around and tell them I love him I I I have to just do good to them that hate you pray for them that despitefully use you and other words they know they're doing it they do it often pray that you can love them because they still deserve to be loved and now I'm gonna say it like this God doesn't sit there and say this one's worthy that one's not that's not the God we serve we serve a God that just loves am it's like a beam it's like the sun coming up in the morning it don't just rise on the houses that are good and the houses that don't pay their taxes you know it it it's dark God is God God is love that's who he is amen but see something is happening here in our lives we are we are walking over the threshold of of making a decision that I want to be in the image of God and so he gives us a little to be faithful with a little and if we're faithful with that little God will give us more and that's just the way it is yes that you may be the children of your father which is in heaven for he maketh the son to rise on the evil and on the good and he sendeth reain on the just and the unjust well you know what happens when it rains in the garden right the weeds also you know get blessed by the by the rain amen it's true brother Braham said in the message Abraham he says quoting Jes Jesus as many as I love I rebuke and I chasen he said therefore repent now here we are that's God that's God our father in the form of the Holy Spirit trying to get back into our lives to control us right when he's telling us to repent that's him that's God that's the Holy Spirit trying to get back inside of us yes to take control of our life it's you know repenting is not a bad thing let's make this straight repenting is probably the best thing that we could ever do amen right repent from our will to do God's will amen so don't don't be afraid of it don't feel and we all got to repent did anybody have a day this year that they didn't need to repent can I see your hand okay so repenting is something that we all have to do so don't be ashamed of it don't be ashamed of it it's the way it's the way back to Heaven amen all right brother BR says he got to have a Church to make and as I said last night the Caps don't come on it it's got to come on their perfect and the church has got to draw into Perfection amen you say perfection that's what Jesus said be ye perfect as my Father in Heaven is perfect so we're drawing into it in the message be not afraid it is I brother Ben says now real sweetly do you love him this is at the end of the message he says now real sweetly do you love him I mean really really love him question mark and he says it makes you love everybody right do you love them yes I do well it should make you want to love everybody if you love them right I just I just love I love amen it really being defined what it means to love God to really love him because when you love him you're filled with him when you love God you're filled with the love of God I'm not now I'm not talking human love because human love loves God don't love God go to church don't go to church keep his word don't keep his word you know on and pay ties don't pay ties but the love of God is solid it's steadfast it's it's unmovable amen the love of God is always there and you just love everybody no matter what they do to you amen so we must keep adding we must keep building upward until the Capstone comes Upon Our character with perfect love brother Braham said in the message the rejected King and I thought oh god oh help me oh God never let me compromise with one word now this is the prophet you would you would think you know with with the wrong Spirit he'd get all hoty and say you know I'm the prophet of this age and you know God's used me for so many miracles and nobody you know nobody else in this age has been caught up in beyond the curtain of time he wasn't like that he was he felt unworthy amen oh God help me never to compromise with one word let me stay right straight on that word yes and preach it I don't care what comes or goes what anybody does how many Sauls or sons of Kesh rise up how many this or that or the other let me Lord press to that place amen that place that place of perfect love that's the place it's a real place by the way it's a place of Peace A PE a place of joy a a place where you're you're so full of God's love that you're you don't feel you're missing out on things right but when you don't have that love you're grabbing Here Wanting this and trying to get S it's a it's a wrong place to be in God is calling us to a different place so we have a choice to pursue the Capstone or to pursue our own life pursue love unconditional or pursue conditional love pursue God's will for our life or to pursue our own will to pursue the full word whatever he says or to pursue just part of the word yeah think about this of course we we you're not in a denomination but the thing is how many people are stuck in those churches who they they do not teach that it's important to go by every word of God and they feel satisfied in those churches and and the thing is they're more they're more light right because you don't have to give as much but here's the thing this is not a relationship between you and the church it's not a relationship between you and your pastor this this thing is a relationship between you and God Amen and it's God's rules he said give your all deny yourself pick up your cross and follow him it's all about his rules amen and it's us up to us to say I Choose You Lord amen I I I choose I I love you because you first love me I'm choosing you because you first chose me amen 1 John 2:5 says but who so but who so keepeth the word his word who so keepeth his word in him in him verily is the love of God perfected hereby know we that we are in him God will not separate himself from the word oh my time is filled with swift transition position our whole relationship comes back to to the word of God right amen it it's not just a church it's not just following rules it's not following the rules of the church it's not following the rules of the message is not following the rules uh of of of dos and don'ts in the Bible it it's all about one thing relationship love he God is going to have a bride that he loves he's going to have a let me were that God is going to have a bride that loves him loves him and and and and she may falter a lot she may make a lot of mistakes she I believe that but there is one characteristic about her she hears that voice be zous and repent she just she falls seven times seven times she gets back up she gets back and she keeps walking this is the key it's not about being perfect and since I had a bad day I'm just going to throw on the towel the rest of the day get back up get back up I say to you get back up get to where you know God wants you to be in the message of leot see in church age brother BR said Christ did not come down to make himself known he did not come to reveal the son he came to to reveal and make known the father he he never talked about two Gods he talked about one God and now in this last age we have come back to the Capstone Revelation the most important revelation of the godhead in the whole Bible that Jesus is God he and the father are one there is one God and his name is the Lord Jesus Christ in the pergamus church age brother bam said in the these last days the true bride Church the true bride Church pareses Christ seed will come to The Headstone and she will be the Super Church a super race as she nears him as she nears him they and the bride will be so much like him that they will be e even in his very image amen this is the order this is this is in order to be United with him they will be one they will be the very manifestation of the word of God Amen the very manifestation of the word of the Living God Amen and he said the denominations can't produce this my now I am faced with um I'm am faced with less time than what I wanted and so now as I stand here before you I have to make very tough decisions where to go from here we have a choice to make to stay with the word and build on it or to make light of the word and just keep living Our Lives I say to you God is called you to be his bride don't stumble at the word don't don't allow the word to stumble you don't be in other words don't be disobedient to it when you're disobedient to the word you're stumbling at the word because God is never going to change his mind about the word it is what he's going to judge the whole world at when it's all over is the word of God so we got to stay with the word and and we have been called a chosen generation a royal priesthood a holy nation A peculiar people that we would show forth the Praises of him who have called us out of Darkness Into His Marvelous Light we were born in darkness right but we've been born again to The Marvelous Light all right in the Statue of a perfect man I'm just going to do my best Lord help me direct me I pray it never was put on the top of the pyramid they couldn't understand why the capping Stone was rejected the head the head Christ but it will come someday now in the building virtue uh building the monument building the statue see it starts off with a foundation stone it's called Faith virtue knowledge Temperance patience godliness brotherly kindness now what does it do then they're waiting for the headstone which is love for God is love and he controls and he is the strength of every one of these yes I love that quote I love that quote in the message it is I Be not Afraid brother BR says since the days of Luther they lived under justification the days of Westley they come a little higher amen the church become in the in the in the minority under sanctification then come the Pentecostal move which was the baptism of the Holy Ghost the restoration of the and now we're going just above that to what to the Capstone amen the church has got to be like the spirit in the church and the and the his Spirit the spirit that's in him has to be the same yes oh my you know we could just take any one of these and just go a whole message on that that but I'll tell you what's so profound to me in this quote he says that the spirit of Christ and the spirit of the church has to be the same brother Brandon says I'd rather have the right spirit and be wrong in my Doctrine you know we need to focus on how we're acting how we're responding how we're displaying ourselves how we're how we're letting the whole world know which side we're on are you with me you know sometimes just we have this little private thing between us and God God don't want it private between him and you he wants you to shine he wants you to be a light to your brothers and sisters he wants you to be a light to your husband a light to your to your wife a light to your children a light to your grandchildren a light to everyone that's around you be a light we must have the same Spirit the spirit in the church and the spirit that's in him has to be the same brother bam said I I know how to do that get rid of my spirit seek more of the holy ghost real simple get serious about my prayer time my brother Bram said the message Jesus keeps all his appointments he said and that's exactly when the church and the word has to be one like Jesus and God was one just exactly they God has was sorry that just I should have went through this brother brah said God was in Christ reconciling the world to himself and so will Christ have to be in the church the anointed word to make everything fulfilled and that's the Capstone that comes upon the last Church age he said not Leo deia he said not Leo DEA now it's a calling out of that it's a bride out of the church it's a church out of a church otherwise it's just like he called a nation out of a Nation amen oh I I love that all right so I'm just going to give you you you got you got a pencil and paper you want to write them down Hebrews chapter 6 vers 1 through3 and verse 9 oh we got to go on to Perfection God is uh persuaded of us better things 1 Corinthians chapter 13 the love chapter Verses 4 through 13 I mean how could we have this great message on the Capstone and not bound to read this in the message but you just go home and you spend some time reading it this is what perfect love is it's chapter 13 amen and then uh Ephesians 4: 12- 16 Ephesians 4 uh this is is God gave us a five-fold Ministry for the perfecting of the saints that we we don't be children just tossed about with every little thing that happens to us but speaking the truth in love may grow up in all things which is the head even Christ from whom the whole body fitly joined together compacted by that which every joint is supplying this is what's going to I want you to think about this scripture after we're done with the potluck as we're all working together you know what I'm saying amen according to the effectual working in every measure of every part making increase of the body unto the edifying of itself in love amen I'm just going to read these two scriptures to you 1 Corinthians 2:9 maybe if they put that on the board but as it is written Eye Is Not Seen Nor Ear heard neither have it entered into the heart of man the things which God has prepared for them that love him the criteria first is love God and you prove that by obedience but God have revealed them unto us by his spirit for the spirit searches all the things yay the Deep things of God Amen all right 2 Timothy 4:7 two verses let's Stand Together 2 Timothy CH 4:7 I have fought a good fight I have finished my course I have kept the faith Amen in other words they stayed on the foundation right they didn't get off they didn't repent get baptized and then start kind of doing what they want to do they stayed right on the foundation henceforth there is laid up for me a crown of righteousness which the Lord the righteous judge shall give me at that day oh I'm so glad he put the rest of this in here and not to me only but unto all them also that love his appearing amen amen the Capstone of perfect love that when Jesus said be ye ready I think this is what he means be ready be just like him he's coming back for who he is he's coming back for his wife they're one amen amen amen let's just bow our hearts in a word of prayer amen maybe with every head bowed if there' be someone here today that said brother John would you remember me the Lord I know the Lord
