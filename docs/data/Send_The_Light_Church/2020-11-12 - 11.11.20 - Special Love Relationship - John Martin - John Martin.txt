TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] jesus is here jesus is here all things are possible cause jesus here jesus is here jesus is here and all things are possible jesus is here hallelujah we just thank you lord jesus for being here tonight lord we want to thank you for your presence tonight lord lord just the very fact that your word declares where just two or three are gathered in your name that you're right in the midst and lord though we perhaps may not feel you we believe that you're here and that the angels in heaven are encamped round about today we want to thank you for that lord that you love us that much to come in our midst lord and to help us lord jesus where we're at to become closer and deeper in the things of god we love you we praise you today lord amen amen how good it is to just praise the lord and to to have a thankful heart when you approach him in his courts and in his house amen amen this is not like uh going over to one another's house and just talking about god this is a place where god is and uh it's just a special reverence in his house amen i greet you in the precious name of jesus and i love you i love you in christ and i say it's just good to be gathered together we never know when the doors are going to be shut for one reason or another and we just want to get all we can while we have the opportunity do you believe somehow some way uh we won't be about to meet sometime and that's going to be a very sad time and i think this is the time that we just just press into christ with everything we got so we don't have any regrets when that happens amen turn with me if you would to the book of first john chapter four i want to say thank you to every one of you for the precious gifts that you gave and the gift of coming and being with me and celebrating it just means that's all we have is just our family have one another and i want to say it means so much to us and may god bless you bless you and reward you as only as as only he can amen let's just read one verse of scripture there first john chapter 4 verse 19. we love him because he first loved us amen let's bounce in prayer heavenly father lord unworthy to read that verse of scripture for this is your holy word lord we're unworthy to read it but lord you've given us a desire to read it you've placed it in our heart to read it and you even said blessed are your eyes we're blessed to read your word and we're blessed to understand it and lord we're praying at this moment a revelation of this little scripture lord that we might uh go deeper into the love of jesus deeper deeper that we might be so full of your love that that's all that ever comes out of us is your love lord have a chance to express it back the way that you expressed it to us lord for we have a chance because you first loved us that we can love you that same way bless this service lord bless the scripture and things that would be said may you just take it to the heart of your people and draw each one of us closer to you lord we'll be ever grateful for these things for we ask it humbly in jesus christ's name amen god bless you may be seated we want to entitle this message your special love relationship and if i could just say becoming as a subject becoming more conscious of how great god's love is and if you would just bear with me tonight might be a little bit of a different service but i want to kind of dramatize a little bit i'm not much of a storyteller but if you could just go back with me don't want to really add anything to the word or take away but just dramatize it a little bit before there was ever a star in heaven a galaxy in the universe or a light in the sky god was there we're going way back but he wasn't even god yet because brother brahm told us that god is an object of worship and there wasn't even a creature created by him yet to honor him as god so it was before he was god so at this time we might identify him as elohim which means the self-existing one brother branham taught us that we can make a god out of anything we could make a god out of uh this desk or a chair but it would not be self-existing only elohim could be the self-existing one in the message adoption part 2 brother branham said there was nothing else existed but him there was no air no light think about it no air no light no stars no world there was nothing else there was no atmosphere there was no atoms there were no molecules think about it there was nothing except the self-existing one amen this self-existing one called elohim he was almighty he was still i'm omnipotent i'm a present i'm i'm an omniscient he was the one that inhabited eternity there was no beginning there was no end it was just eternity and it's impossible to a human to understand or comprehend what that really means all you can do is believe it we could describe him as a described melchizedek hebrews chapter 7 verse 3 says he was without father without mother without descendant having neither beginning of days nor end of life but made himself like unto the son of god but as far as we can reach back in our mind to where it all started he identifies himself in revelations chapter one verse eight he says i am alpha and omega the beginning and the end even though he's eternity there was no beginning there was no end we can't comprehend it as far as we can go back he's teaching as i am the the alpha and omega the beginning and the end saith the lord which was which is which was and which is to come the almighty now we know that god is invisible brother branham said in the message who is god he said a little white light like a a mystic light like a halo and this was the logos that went out of god in the beginning this was the son of god that came out of the bosom of the father just trying to understand it it was a little it was the light because see god's invisible right so this little light that came out that was the son of god john chapter 1 verse 1 says in the beginning was the word and the word was with god and the word was god so we see the the combination because the word eventually became flesh it it it materialized it went beyond thoughts words into the manifestation so many i don't know how many billions of years beyond this but why is this so important in the beginning was the logos the word the word was the son of god paul identifies this logos in colossians chapter 1 verse 15. he said who is the image of invisible god the firstborn of every creature and i'll tell you if you want to get out of this service what i want you to get out of it you got to come with me here you got to come with me at the beginning who is in the image of the invisible god the firstborn of every creature for by him for by this was uh were by him were all things created that are in heaven that are in earth visible and invisible whether it be thrones of minions principalities powers all things were created by him and for him so this little light that came out this longest that came out of this invisible god is the one that created everything everything in heaven was created by jesus christ jesus christ the logos went out of god in the beginning as far as we can go back the son of god came out of the bosom of the father brother bran said now we visualize jesus christ was about a little longer than 2 000 years ago now a lot of people visualize this is when jesus was born the son of god was born in the manger and they've got this thinking that god just put that that seed there at that time and that was the beginning of the son of god instead of the understanding that the only way it could be a son is it had to be lesser it had to come to a lesser place because god can't die you can't die you can't kill god you can't crucify god jesus said in saint john chapter 8 verse 58 jesus said unto them verily verily i was saying to you before abraham was i am showing that he was before that time referring to who spoke to moses out of the burning bush that's what he's referring to first corinthians chapter 10 verse 4 and did all drink the same spiritual drink for they drink of that spiritual rock that followed them and that rock was christ speaking that he was there during the time of israel all three all things were created by jesus christ and they were created for himself jesus christ created many things before there was even an earth inside of this visible invisible god that inhabited eternity were attributes and characteristics we've we've heard of this that describe the nature of who he was what he liked and what he didn't like the bible teaches us that god is is holy that he's righteous he's true he's just he's faithful and none of his characteristics can be perfectly defined in a human dictionary we all may have our our own ideas but we can only know the true identity through revelation and that's god speaking to your heart what he is now prayer is what puts us in contact with god i say if there's a time we need to pray we need to pray more now than we ever did in the past prayer puts us in contact where we can truly know his true characteristics in god's provided way of worship brother branham said the first thing he made was angelic beings that worshipped him that was the first thing that jesus christ created that beautiful god became an object of worship god created angelic beings to worship him to acknowledge him to give him honor to to to to give him what he was do because he created them he was great greatly to be praised so important that we understand this why else would god create an angel to protect him why would i need to create something to protect me he created them to worship him to bring him pleasure to honor him because he's worthy and it's important that we see this because if we don't give him the honor the worship the praise that he's worthy of we're out of our position of why he created us we can get an idea of his righteousness and his holiness when we look into the vision that isaiah had turn with me to isaiah chapter six in verse one in the year that king use uh uh uzziah died i saw also the lord sitting upon a throne high and lifted up and his train filled the temple we're just looking in to the heavens that god created before there was ever an earth above it stood the seraphims each one had six wings with two they covered their faces because they were unworthy to look at their creator and with two they covered their feet because i used to know why it was some sort of reverence and wit two they did fly and one cried unto another and said holy holy holy holy is the lord of hosts the whole earth is full of his glory now imagine this is all they did we might think in a carnal sense that's going to be awful boring i want a different job but it's showing more who god is that he's not just holy but he's really holy that he's that he's really to be reverent and because see satan has a way of look at laodicea right now they're stuck in a church where they kick god out of the church and having their own church without god they look at god as is someone that needs to be entertained they've taken this uh so far from who god is and the post of the door moved at the voice of him that cried and the whole house was filled with smoke and isaiah came to the realization during this time he said whoa is me i'm i'm don't i don't fit in this place i'm not i'm not crying holy holy i'm i'm i i don't fit here you ever been a place you don't feel like you're fit that's exactly where isaiah fell i don't fit in this place for i am undone because i am a man of unclean lips and i dwell in the midst of a peep of unclean lips for my eyes have seen the the king and the the lord of hosts then flew one of the seraphims unto me having a live coal in his hand which he had taken with the tongs from off the altar and he laid it upon my mouth and he said lo this have touched thy lips and thy iniquity is taken away and thy sin is purged boy that gives me hope where did that happen right in church right in church god promised to me us and as far as i'm concerned every day we backslide every day we've got iniquities every day we need to get serious about getting clean amen isaiah 57 15 says his name is holy so we're getting an idea of this this self-existing one he was a holy self-existing one amen he didn't he didn't become that he didn't say well this is what i want to do when i grow up he is that so this is his nature god created a whole host of angelic beings to worship him you know god really loves to be worshipped he created a lot of angels did you know every angel that he created worshiped him satan took a third of them they stopped worshiping they left the first estate the bible says but the bible says his train filled the temple it was all about god it was all about how great he was that's why he he created all these angels and we really don't know how many he created but there was a lot of them there were a lot of them and they were all worshiping god he created them to so they would worship him serve him and talk of his greatness why are we so caught up in our world why do we lose track of the god that created us there are different scriptures in the bible that we can identify jesus christ in fact brother brennan makes the statement he says if you can't see jesus christ in every scripture of the bible then go back and read it because he is the word he's the whole word you may not find him born in a manger in every scripture but he's in every scripture because he is the word from he was the word in the beginning that came out the bosom of the father god showed moses a pattern in heaven to make the tabernacle in the wilderness from we could read that nexus chapter 25 if we had time but we don't have time but he made the what he was to make the pattern uh exactly what was in heaven so god created all those things in heaven and they served a purpose and he received glory the whole earth was full of history at that time of heaven was full of that glory and when time shall be no more we're going to go back to a temple the same revelations chapter 21 verse 22 follow with me revelations 21 verse 22 and i saw no temple therein for the lord god almighty and the lamb are the temple of it so who's the temple god becomes the temple the lamb amen jesus christ and the city had no need of the sun neither the moon to shine to it for the glory of god did lighten it and the lamb is the light thereof and the nations of them which are saved shall walk in the light of it and the kings of the earth to bring their glory and honor to it so notice god is still looking for glory for praise for honor he's looking to receive praise just like he did at the beginning when the first thing he made was angels to praise him it's the last thing and everything he wants the leaves to clap their hand and praise him if these don't uh worship the very rocks will cry out god is a god that he wants to be worshiped more than we want to give him and the devil has a way to get his soul distracted with this natural life that we forget our spiritual life because to worship him is a responsibility it should be an honor but at least it's a responsibility that's our first estate i'll tell you when we first got saved what happened thank you jesus [Laughter] and that's why i don't think jesus wants us to forget about calvary when we get on the other side amen so god created all these different angels all these amazing things in heaven all of which were unfolding really unveiling who jesus christ really was and displaying his true characteristics of the person that he wants god love to create things that please him there's a purpose things that brought him glory and honor and we sung it at the beginning of the service revelations chapter 4 verse 11 brother ron started singing this i said lord thank you you do this just so often you don't have to do this lord but i i just know it's you [Music] thou art worthy o lord to receive glory and honor and power for thou has created all things and for thy pleasure they are and were created shown as clear-cut you know this is the purpose that we are created ezekiel chapter 28 verse 13 god created some other things says thou has been in eden the garden of god every precious stone was thy covering the sardis topaz the diamond the barrel the onyx this jazz fire uh jasper sapphire ambro kind of put those two together and the carbuncle and the gold the workmanship of thy tablets and of thy pipes were prepared in thee in the day that thou was created i want you to realize something if you go back to where we were revelation chapter 21 god uses seven of these precious stones in the foundation so you know when lucifer was created he was created just perfect verse 14 thou art the anointed cherub that covereth and i have set thee so thou was upon the holy mountain of excuse me of god thou has walked up and down the midst of the stones of fire thou was perfect in thy ways from the day that thou was created until nicory was found in thee he was created perfect god is such a good god god creates a perfect cherub in heaven to please him to bring him honor to bring him glory and i just want us to go there before we look at him as being the devil for a second god gives us perfect cherub the responsibility to lead others to proper worship and praise is that the truth it was a perfect atmosphere in heaven when lucifer would get up there and he would lead the worship this cherub he looked perfect he did perfect he brought more of a perfect praise to god because that's the reason god created him and god was pleased and he enjoyed the atmosphere that was created by him because he made him for that purpose he was perfect in thy ways not just one but through a space of time he took lightly this awesome responsibility and turns it into an opportunity to get a little bit of the praise and recognition for himself a little honor for himself what was once created to bring god glory was now bringing now beginning to take glory away from god to place it upon himself the clay was saying to the potter i don't want to be what you created me to be this is when iniquity was beginning to be formed in this great beautiful cherub that god had created and as soon as you stop bringing god glory in honor with the life he has placed in your hands iniquity will begin to take over in your life that's how important it is to praise god to worship god and to give him what he's worthy of the closer we get to god the more we should be praised and the more we should be in his image more in his likeness we were created to bring pleasure to god to bring glory and honor to his name we can bring pleasure to god amen think out of your box the bible says in genesis chapter 1 verse 1 we could all probably quote this in the beginning god created the heaven and the earth and the earth was without form and void and darkness was upon the face of the deep and the spirit of god moved upon the face of the waters now notice god originally creates earth without form and without void why didn't he just create it all perfect to begin with all in one day why'd he wait seven days why didn't he just go boom this is important because we're learning about the nature of god the character of god the person of god if i could say it like that he wanted to enjoy what he was doing he wanted to take his time and enjoy it ecclesiastes chapter 3 verse 11 says he have made everything beautiful in his time also he have set the world in their heart so that no man can find out the work of god uh uh find out the work that god maketh from the beginning to the end god enjoys taking his time for there is a season for everything he does under the heaven the bible says god wants us to be patient with the work that he's doing in us god wanted to take his his time and enjoy the fruits of his labor he wanted to enjoy the glory and the honor that it brought to him because when he when he created the first day when he he created the angels in heaven looked and marveled at what god had made amen each day of god's creation when he got done with it he sat back and he looked and he said it is good he enjoyed it and he spent a thousand years enjoying that it's wonderful i mean you just speak the word it happens like that why did it take as long as it did because that's what god wanted he wanted to enjoy the workmanship of his hands he wanted to enjoy the fruits of his labor because he wanted to get praise for that one thing sometimes we just you know do so much that we don't really recognize and take the time that we should with each thing begin to take for granted perhaps every thousand years god would create something and all the angelic beings would be they would marvel and be amazed at what god would would do and just praise him and praise him and i could just see the angels in heaven shouting hallelujah praise our god he's a great god look what he's created he didn't sit down here like we do in church and say okay yeah well i already knew that give me something different this is a real thing they were probably singing thou heart worthy that these things that you created were created for thy pleasure may you receive pleasure you're worthy of it he was worthy of the power that he had because he had power with character amen after all the things that god had created god still wanted to create a man in his own image a man that would bring him glory that would bring him praise and that would look at him as he is honor to please him that he could look down and and see a resemblance of himself brother branham and the bible teaches us that that he created man as a little god with the uh the ability to speak the word create an atmosphere which we all have the ability to do we have the ability to create a better atmosphere between our ears in the prayer rooms in this in this room right here because god has placed that that creating the atmosphere is what creates faith yeah if you you want more faith you want god to speak to you more create an atmosphere he's pleased to be in if everything's negative and remember when they were they were in the upper room they were in one mind and one accord and they weren't biting talking about things and they weren't worried about who the who the next president was going to be in jerusalem got to focus on our the life that we're called to not not the world that we're in god brother adam taught us that brother branham brother and said that god would come down in the cool of the evening and he would begin to have a fellowship and a communion with adam and it was just so wonderful and i just i just can't picture adam being disagreeable with god you know telling them that you know you need to do things a little bit different you know this new age religion right they got to change the bible they got to change the way things are i'm so glad that jesus christ is the same yesterday today and forever and that we can know god who he is amen we don't try to figure out he's the same he's an awesome god and he's worthy to be praised the glory of god was on display first in heaven and now on earth in everything that god had created it was bringing him glory there's so many of god's characteristics that were on display through everything that adam saw he just praised god for the animals that god had created and and the mountains and the seas and the and the the butterflies and the birds and all the things that creeped on the earth sometimes they're creepy now but but through every one of them looking at that hummingbird flapping his wings so fast and he couldn't even hardly count him that's how fast god made that bird to flap his wings you just sit back and you just if you take time to look at an animal you just god is awesome his glory is on display everywhere but people don't recognize god they look at it and they don't even think where that came from they'll go as far as darwin's theory and that's it they they don't understand how all the intestines are hooked together just right that that that that that the stomach isn't at the end and the the large intestine isn't connected to your esophagus they just how you can cut yourself and your skin begins to close it god just comes and he stitches it over time god is amazing and you know satan don't want them to think about that because they may get the mindset of starting to look at god and want to praise him that's why we need to praise god send the devil flying we need to have more praise in the church in the prayer closet in the worship and in the receiving of the word we need more praise because god inhabits the praises of his people verse 3 and god said let there be light and there was light and god saw the light that it was good and god divided the light from darkness god took time to enjoy everything that he did to sit back and he wanted others seen it all the angels are created looking at that and were amazed at what god had done when they looked at everything that was created in earth and in heaven it was like us looking up at the stars and seeing so many stars on a clear night some are bright some are faded but there's so many you can't count them and every one of them had glory every one of them had a story every one of them showed forth it wasn't just oh whatever it everywhere that the angels were looking that adam was looking it was just the glory of god was everywhere it was only god and god set back and he said everything i i created i created for myself to bring me pleasure in glory and he stood by he said it is good everything god created was good everything he did was good god is a good god all the time now you would think that god would be so pleasantly content with all the glory that he was receiving but he still had some other characteristics inside of him that no one ever seen no one knew they existed characteristics like being merciful never seen before gracious slow to anger long suffering being no respecter of persons patient and temperate and kind and tenderhearted if i could take a moment and just ask you this question is god considered a good god because he's just and true and righteous and holy or is god considered a good god because of all the benefits we get from his other characteristics how often when we think about god being good is when we're thinking about all these other characteristics that we'd never know about we don't think of him as a good god because he's a god of judgment because we kind of don't want to be judged by god we want to be loved by god we want to be forgiven by god we want god to be patient with us that's where we can testify and say god is good these other tenderhearted characteristics could not even be known in a perfect heavenly setting they could not be manifested or seen the beautiful way that things were yet down deep inside of god they existed they were there in the center of god's heart god still had an aching inside to express a love that was never known never seen or never manifested to all the angels that he created along with these other tenderhearted characteristics were certain attributes there as well also could not be manifested in such a setting as in a perfect heaven brother brandon told us that inside god were the attributes of a healer of a redeemer of a savior of a deliverer a sanctifier a provider and a protector there was just there just wasn't anyone in heaven that needed to be healed that needed to be delivered or or saved or redeemed or protected no one to be sanctified but yet this was still inside of god after how many thousands and millions and could have been trillions of years and it never came out god is love there's no dictionary that can describe god's love nor the love of god but we do know that inside of god was a love so strong and so powerful that it could bear the worst condition that it can endure the worst possible situation it was so powerful it could never fail and yet those angels never seen it because they always saw the best conditions well why didn't they just use it on you know satan when he got out of place because that was a two so he could use it because it wasn't just showing that love that god was interested in it was having a love relationship he could have showed his love but he wants to receive that love it's about a relationship that god had in mind this power was not only unknown and unseen by all of heaven but god never experienced now listen to the statement god had never experienced the feeling of releasing that love because there was no one to ever release it to it's a special love what it felt like to release from his heart to unlock such a power that had been harnessed and locked up it had been building up inside of god and god had a powerful love locked up inside of his heart for thousands perhaps millions and we don't even know trillions of years we just don't know how long it was it was just unknown to the angels indescribable unmanifested only god knew about it to think that for such an amazing length of time no one knew about this amazing great love of god no one knew just how far it would go never really knew the boundaries of this love it had never been witnessed before ephesians chapter 3 verse 17 that christ may dwell in your heart by faith now we we saying about this that you being rooted and grounded in love may be able to comprehend with all saints what is the breath the length the depth and the height and to know the love of christ that passive knowledge that he might be filled with the fullness of god i just want to say the only way that you're really going to know the deepness of the love of god is to get full of god because the love of god is shed abroad into our hearts by god by the holy ghost so the more of god you get the more of love the more you study about the love of god does not mean the more love you get just means the more knowledge you get knowledge doesn't make you be merciful doesn't make you go the second mile doesn't make you turn the cheek but i'll tell you god inside of you will amen there are no human dictionaries that can define god's love but first corinthians 13 teaches us that his love is so powerful that it never fails it bears all things it believes all things it holds all things that endures all things charity never faileth it is many of us have experienced this love knows that this power this power in god's love there's nothing like it because we were unlovable and he loved us because we didn't care and he cared because we didn't reach up to him and he reached down to us we witnessed something that no other angels in heaven experienced i wonder if if lucifer ever had a thought oh i just wish he would reach down his hand to me think about it how blessed the people we are sitting here today because we have experienced the love of god in our hearts we are blessed to know a love that loves those that hate him that loves his enemies just think about this being inside of god it not be too hard to understand why god was a lonely god how many times have we heard you can have everything you want you're still unhappy and all these things bringing them glory and honor yet there was just something missing inside of god to be able to express something so deep so real i'm so grateful that god did the only way that this powerful love could ever be manifested is god had to allow a fallen condition just for the purpose of not only being able to express an amazing love that never was before but listen to this but for the purpose of being able to feel that same amazing love being expressed back to him god saved the best for last he waited billions and trillions of years to have this experience with you he wanted an amazing love relationship that he never ever ever had experienced before just think about it never experienced this before and now god is having it with you amen this just blesses me so much what did he do he expressed his love first he lay down his life he gave everything he had at calvary he stuck out his neck first in this relationship you know a lot of times people don't want to commit to someone and some even a friendship relationship because they don't want to get hurt they don't want to get rejected they don't want to get turned down they don't want to get made fun of and so they're scared to take the first step in love but that didn't bother jesus he was despised he was rejected he was mocked made fun of lied cursed at but it didn't bother him because he had expressed this love to his bride he stuck his neck out first for you when you did not care about him he loved you first even when you were dead in your sins bible says we are aliens with god walking in the desire of our flesh and not even caring at all he stuck his neck out for us he wasn't worried about getting hurt and look how many people have turned him down but he has a little bride that loves him with that same love god took a chance he stuck out his neck not wanting someone or anyone to reject him the bible says that he with it all would come to the knowledge of this great love john chapter 1 verse 11 he came to his own and his own received him not but as many as received unto them gave he power to become sons of god even to them that believe on his name he gave us a chance to stick out our neck for him amen the same way he loved us unconditionally first john chapter 4 verse 19 are opening scripture we love him because he first loved us it's a special love relationship now you can actually see god the way that he sees you at the beginning we didn't even know god when we first came to god we thought we knew everything and the more that we serve him the more we realize we don't really see all of god saying we're looking through a glass darkly but the more that you that he reveals himself to you the more that you will live that love back to him because he loves you you love him because he first loved you are you catching what i'm saying he told us he's given us a chance to love him back the same way that he loved us now we can't go up to to jesus right now and and lay down our life for him like he did for us but he told us that if you actually go lay down your life for somebody it'll be the same thing as you doing it for me that's exactly what he said what you've done to the least of these these little ones you've done it unto me so we do have a chance to love him with the same giving the same love that same special love that he loved us with we think oh that's just for them brother man says you do something for somebody that can't do nothing for you you'll see how god blesses you in other words you're not trying to get something out of it that's what god is wanting us to develop that special love relationship when did you visit me in prison when did i visit you in prison when did i feed you i didn't see you we have an opportunity what we do to others we're really doing for the lord that's why it's important that you're nice to people say nice things to one another because it's if you're not you're it's like saying bad things to the lord no one else in heaven or in earth can be a part of this special love relationship that you have with god except you think about that nobody else that's how special this is you weren't some rock created some ocean created some perfect angel created no you were created to so that you could give back that same love that god gave you oh what an honor what an honor no one else can experience this but the bride of jesus christ you have been elected to this very special love relationship you've been chosen to it you have not chosen me but i have chosen you we love him because he first loved us amen john 15 13 says greater love have no man than this than a man lay down his life for another person's life he saved something that he never experienced with any of the angels he lay down his life for us god did it for you you know what he's doing right now he's waiting for you to show that same love back to him it's amazing why paul said i die daily he said i'm crucified with christ because the mo if you die every day what you're doing is expressing that love back to god every day it's an opportunity to love god it's not a law that you have to god so loved the world that he gave his life for a special love relationship that's what he did it for god rich in mercy for his great love wherewith he loved us for a special love relationship that's why he did it he's looking to get something out of this friends now there's a whole world out there that don't want to get the time of day it goes in one year out the other they look at jesus christ born in the manger died on the cross take their sins away and that's the end of it but to those who are developing their love relationship with god they're actually exercising laying down their life to show that they love god with the same love that he gave them we love him because he first loved us without him showing that love for us we'll never give it back to him think about all the people he died for the world and they won't do one thing to lay down their life for him because they don't realize that he loved them first think about it but when we get a revelation of his love we will love him back that's all there is to it john chapter 3 verse 16. let's perceive if we got the same love of god that's what this says first john chapter 3 verse 16. because he laid down his life for us and we ought to lay down our lives for the brethren why the brethren jesus isn't here we'd probably personally go do it for him but he doesn't want us to do it personally to him he's not there he wants us to do what he did which is lay down his life for everybody our enemies our neighbors people hate us lay it down because when you lay it down look it wasn't easy for jesus that came out of the bosom of the father at the beginning was it easy for him he he cried he sweated he he was in pain he had headaches he was tempted and all measures like we were he didn't want to go and die out he was asking for another way it's not strange if you're looking for another message but there is no other message john said this is the same message from the beginning that we love one another this is the the very beginning message lay down your life for a special love relationship this determines where you're at this determines perceive hey let's figure out if we got the love of god that's what this is saying if you're doing the same thing he did you're giving back what he gave to you you got it it's that simple well brother john i did it last month praise god praise god but you have a chance to do it every day to die out every day that you can lay down your life for him this is this is all about your love relationship with god that's what this message is about it's something that we need to be interested in amen psalms 91 we've got a couple more scriptures and then we're going to stop psalms 91 verse number one he that dwelleth in the secret place of the most high shall abide under the shadow of the almighty so we're talking about a secret relationship with god amen you're getting in a place where most people are not you're dwelling with god where most people are not verse 9 because thou because you have made the lord which is your refuge even the most high thy habitation in other words i have decided that i am going to dwell in this relationship with god verse 14 because he have set his love upon me god is interested in the motive of you setting your love upon him because he set his love upon you this was no christmas gift you know what was the other day y'all came over and you gave gifts tell me one of you that expected me to give you a gift in return not a one not a one and we think god's gift is free and you can't earn it so he's not expecting any gift he's expecting your life the gift of your life back to him he's worthy that's why we went through this whole message at the beginning of showing all these things he made he created for his glory he wants to receive praise and worship to everything he does we're no different in fact we're more special than them anything else he's ever created we're more special we've been redeemed no one's ever experienced that just the reading so we should be giving him more praise we know that when we get to heaven and we're praising them they won't be able to sing that song you know there may be some rocks crying out there may be some leaves clapping there may be some waves hitting the shore there may be some birds chirping there may be some angels saying glory and honor and holy and worthy but there will be nobody singing i've been redeemed but the redeemed to feel that special love that nobody else felt you're gonna feel so special in heaven you're gonna be standing there you're the chosen for you recognizing it now this is what's important romans chapter 8 closing with this special love verse 35 who shall separate us from the love of christ show tribulation distress persecution famine nakedness perils sword presidents colvin don't let anything get you down nothing stay in love with jesus as it is written for thy sake we are killed all the day long why why it gives a chance for you to love god properly we are counted as sheep for the slaughter nay in all these things we are more than conquerors through him that loved us my i think some of david's greatest times that he had with the lord is when he was down when he had when he had fallen when he had made mistakes when he had everything come against him he was as low as he could get but i tell you he was as close to god at that time as any time because he come to to revive those that are down those that are broken-hearted those that are that feel like god i need you the most gives a chance for god to feel that love that you have for him because i tell you when you the bills are paid you got a money and you got this and you got that and you've got friends and everybody's liking you chances of you humbling yourself the way you should to god are much harder that's why the bible says the rich the very the hardly very many noble rich people make it because something is standing in a way of a love relationship for i am persuaded that neither death nor life nor angels amen principalities or powers or things present or things to come nor high nor death nor any other creature shall be able to separate us from the love of god which is in christ jesus i hope you feel that way today let's stand together i love him because he first loved me remember they naaman his servant said now if he would have asked you to do some great thing once you have done it just go do what he told you to do when we lay down our life we're showing god how much we love him amen i love him because he first loved me oh love him i love him because he first love me [Music] and purchase my [Music] on
