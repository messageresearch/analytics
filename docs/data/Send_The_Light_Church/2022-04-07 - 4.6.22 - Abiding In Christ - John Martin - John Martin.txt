good to be in the house of the lord i'm still running off the gasoline from the last service i should say the holy spirit from the last service it's good to gather together all the mores we see the day approaching this mid-week service if you turn with me in the book of saint john chapter 10 and we're going to have three scripture readings before we're seated but we have an important subject i feel tonight to try to look at um abiding in christ i want to entitle this message i really didn't have a title for it until today but if i could say it like this it's a lot easier to get detached from god than we realize and uh i i just i want us to be secure i don't want us to miss it and that's why i want to go through these scriptures and for those that are not here those that are live streaming maybe they can also uh when they get a chance because it's for them as well amen let's let's just look to the lord in prayer before we begin reading heavenly father we're not worthy to even approach your word it is so holy so righteous so perfect and we are so unholy so unrighteous and so imperfect lord but you've given us grace you've covered us with your blood and and now lord we're asking that you give us eyes to see to catch the real meaning of your word tonight and god that you would uh give us revelation of the very point that your you would have for us lord because we don't want to miss it for anything lord we ask that you would uh take the any deceivingness that the enemy had tried to put on us uh lord that you just help our eyes to see where you want us to be and how you want us to be standing in this hour please bless your word lord as we read it now we commit the service with all the needs that we have we ask that your word would minister to them and lord to those that are live-streaming those that are sick that couldn't make it lord we just pray your grace would be with each and every one of them we thank you for these things for we ask you jesus precious name amen amen our first scripture reading is in saint john chapter 10 we want to start with verse number 27 this is a familiar scripture my sheep hear my voice and i know them and they follow me and i give unto them eternal life and they shall never perish neither shall any man pluck them out of my hand my father which gave them me is greater than all and no man is able to pluck them out of my father's hand what is security amen turn with me to the chapter 15. a few chapters over starting with verse number one of saint john chapter 15 i am the true vine and my father is the husbandman and every branch in me that beareth not fruit he taketh away so no man can take us out of the hand of of the father but here he himself detaches us if we do not bear fruit every branch in me that beareth not fruit is taken away and every branch that beareth fruit he purgeth it that it may bring forth more fruit now you are clean through the word which i have spoken unto you abide in me and i in you and as the as the branch cannot bear fruit of itself except it abide in the vine no more can you except you abide in me i am the vine here are the branches he that abideth in me and i in him the same bringeth forth much fruit for without me you can do nothing amen and then in hebrews chapter 3 hebrews chapter 3 verses 10 through 12 and then we'll have you be seated i know you've been standing in a while hebrews chapter 3 starting with verse 10 wherefore i was grieved with that generation and said they do always err in their heart and they have not known my ways so i swear in my wrath they shall not enter into my rest take heed brethren lest there be in any of you an evil heart of unbelief in departing from the living god god bless you may be seated well if we're abiding in christ we will bear the fruit of the spirit amen now inside of all fruit is the seed and i believe if we're bearing the fruit of the spirit we're going to be bringing souls to christ i just believe that that's christ in you doing the work of of of of of the kingdom of to those that have yet to be saved and even though there is an eternal security we have been warned that if we don't stay connected we don't keep abiding in christ that he will detach us and it's a scary scary thought the bible says it's a fearful thing to fall into the hands of a living god and we think of god being loving and how could he do anything that would would harm us well it's not in his heart to harm us at all and he wouldn't do anything to harm us but we ourselves by not abiding in christ could literally force a situation and uh in our last scripture reading here in hebrews it talks about the children of israel this is a well-known story but we we understand that this story was written for our admonition that's what it was really about was for us we understand that god's people were delivered out of the hand out of the out of egypt by the mighty hand of jehovah and it's basically a perfect type of a christian believer today who's come out of the world it was by the grace of god that he called us that we recognized that we we we weren't a part of this world anymore and that he saved us and this is what he did for the children of israel when they were in egypt we also learned that god's people are murmured and they complained a lot after they were delivered and uh this negative attitude that continued on with them it it brought them to a situation to where they they they wandered in the wilderness for 40 years because of this negativity it wouldn't lasted that long if they would have been just with a good attitude do you believe that something i want to bring to our attention joshua and caleb were there with him during this 40 years the only difference is is they didn't murmur and they didn't complain about what was going on they still held on to god's promise they had to put up with everybody else's negativity they had to put up with the results of what the church had to go through but they remained faithful they went through the same tests the same trials the same hardships the same disappointment the same sufferings but they weren't murmuring and complaining about it right amen the bible says that they came out of egypt a mixed multitude like the prophet taught us that in every church there's three types of believers there's the believer the mate believer and the unbeliever there are just certain things that some believers don't believe right you know we look at as an unbeliever who is just completely out in the world he's the antichrist doesn't believe in god just he's just he's an unbeliever but he wouldn't be in the church if he was like that so i wanted to find the unbeliever as someone who just doesn't believe all the word they believe part of it but they don't believe all of it there's just certain things that believers don't believe and if you don't believe all the word you're not a believer man shall live by most of the word no but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of god and god wants us to believe every word and then there are those who appear to believe they act like they believe they talk like they are a believer but they're missing the power to lay down their life and live for others life just goes on about them it's more on the outside and then you have the genuine believers they don't just say amen to the word they actually are living the word they're living for others they've given their life to christ and now the work that they're doing is the work of christ through them their character the believer's character is becoming more and more like the image of christ now no matter how much murmuring complaining was going on in the camp joshua and caleb were still working out their own salvation the other ones they they weren't fearing they just they were murmuring they were going oh we should have just you know was better back in the world could do what you want to do but joshua and caleb they were still working out their salvation amen they were still had the fear of god they still held to the word of god they still believed now they weren't immune from the chaotic confusion that was always being created at the camp they were just overcomers they kept their eyes on the promises of god their whole thought process was different so no matter what kind of believer we are we are all going to experience the wilderness we're going to it it doesn't matter if you don't like the outdoors or not every one of us is going to be tested we're going to be proven we're going to go through things just because we're going through trials doesn't mean it doesn't mean one thing or another god wants to prove who we are take heed brethren lest there be in any of you in any of you an evil heart of unbelief in departing from the living god now lucifer he had an evil heart of unbelief he departed with a third of the angels cain had an evil heart of unbelief he departed from the advice that god gave him his own word there are many examples in the bible that talk about departing from the living god but you know who else can have an evil heart of unbelief god's people that's why we're we want to be careful of the thoughts that we think about the decisions that we make what we're going to do with our life and how we're going to serve god and all those things that every one of us have to define but god's people can depart from the living god they can have an evil heart of unbelief look at the disciples look at the disciple judas i mean he walked with jesus all the way he was part of the miracles he he took care of the offerings but he manifested the son of petition look at the disciples of god that followed jesus for a while turn with me if you would to saint john chapter 6 and they were these disciples were even helping out with the ministry these weren't just followers these were those that actually ministered and helped but they departed after the preaching become too difficult what god was expecting out of their lives become too hard saint john 6 verse 63 it is the spirit that quickeneth the flesh prophetess nothing the words i speak unto you they are spirit in their life jesus said and he says but there are some of you that believe not for jesus knew from the beginning who they were that believe not and who should betray him so at the beginning now they were all professing to believe all professing to follow all professing to just to stand as a disciple of christ and he said therefore said i unto you that no man can come unto me except there were given up to him of my father not one i want us to believe today all of us here that god had put something inside of us and that's why we have come to the father that's why we're here today but you can't just uh rest on that statement and forget about everything else because these that walked away thought the same thing and verse 66 says from that time many of his who disciples went back and walked no more with him i know some of this is is you've heard this before but this was a disciple of christ these were those in the ministry they got to a point where they walked back they stopped abiding in christ they had an evil heart of unbelief and departing from the living god these were not unbelievers but many of his disciples went back and walked no more how many people have left this message right how many people have just stopped going to church come on this is a real situation then said jesus unto the twelve will ye also go away don't you love it that he's interested in whether we're going to stay connected or not amen then simon peter answered him lord to whom shall we go that was the words of eternal life and we believe and are sure that thou art the christ the son of the living god jesus said he that endureth to the end the same shall be saved we've got to keep that in mind amen it's not what we think about god it's not how we feel about god it's not even the knowledge that we have about god god's people are not immune of developing an evil heart of unbelief you don't like something god wants you to do i mean it's easy to get a hard heart right let's just take a look at the the children of god that came out of egypt these were god's people and the bible says they cried and god heard their cry by a reason of their afflictions so god heard their cries and he came down he called them people and i'm going to help them they danced in the spirit they rejoiced in the very presence of god they sang songs of deliverance your shoes never wore out i got to get a pair at least once a year because my crack on the bottom and i try to buy the best ones i can buy but their shoes never wore out they could prove that they were spirit-led by day and by night god gave him oh a a rock where water came out and the bible says that that christ followed them so god was faithful god fed them these these people of god experienced miracles they witnessed the supernatural works of god for 40 years but these people had an evil heart of unbelief jude chapter 1 verse 5 says i will therefore put you to remember so he once knew this how that the lord having saved the people of the land of egypt afterwards he destroyed them that believed not and the angels which kept not their first estate but left their own habitation he have reserved an everlasting chains on under darkness unto the judgment of the great day now these believers never thought they departed from god you couldn't get one of them to say i i i i'm leaving god no they said they'll leave the prophet leave the message leave this direction that they're leading me but they never thought they had an evil heart of unbelief they battled fears complexes but they still believed in god not evil they still believed in the miracles of god they still believe that moses was a prophet but like a lot of people they think you know brother brandon went off the deep end or something who knows what the devil told him about moses now it's difficult to understand how a group of believers that had repented that walked with with god for 40 years and had all these signs wonders miracles and they got to a point where they were willing to go over at the end but they had departed from god now it's hard to understand that god's testimony to them was different than their own testimony a lot of times god's testimony is different than our testimony but they had an evil heart of unbelief in departing from the living god now to understand this a little bit more we want to look at the scriptures before and after so turn with me if you would to hebrews chapter 3 verse 5. i'll show how easy it is to slip away from god and not even realize it verse 5 says and moses verily was faithful in all his house as a servant for a testimony of those things which were to be spoken after but christ as his son over his own house whose house we are if we hold fast the confidence and the rejoicing of the hope firm on to the end amen if you just let go of your confidence you let go of your rejoicing of your hope think about it you can develop an evil heart of unbelief amen it's important that you keep rejoicing you keep your eyes on the promise that you will manifest all of christ there's a promised land for us we are god's house if we keep moving forward into all of god's promise because he gave them a promise he gave us a promise amen god is not going to live in an unfinished house right we're his house no matter what we claim no matter how much we we're attached we say we're predestined we've got to get finished you know the bride have made herself ready we've got we've got to put on the responsibility to get to the place that we're in his image amen god is not going to keep living in a believer if he doesn't hold fast his confidence so it's not st where we start out but it's how we finish verse 7 wherefore as the holy ghost say it now this is the holy ghost talking this is what the holy spirit is really trying to say to the believer's hearts that's you and i today if we will hear his voice and harden not your heart as in the provocation in the day of temptation in the wilderness when your fathers tempted me proved me and saw my works for 40 years now we've seen god working among us for many years many years he has proven himself to be faithful over and over to us yet how many times have we doubted god how many times we said lord why me this isn't fair it's too hard for me why am i going through this how many times have we came to church heard the word but neglected to walk out living that word giving so little attention to it how many times we required god to give us some signs some proof that what we heard was really of god not of some man when your fathers tempted me and proved me and saw my works 40 years it's not the action but the reaction god is looking how we're going to react verse 10 wherefore i was grieved with that generation think about here's a group of people where he performed all these miracles for 40 years they had a testimony they could write books that god jehovah was with them but here he said he was grieved with him how could god be blessing these people like he has and yet grieved so we can't go off of god's blessing us and that's the end of the story the bible says they do always air in their heart and they have not known my ways so i swear in my wrath that they shall not enter into my wrath i'll say there is a big difference between having experiences with god and knowing the ways of god not just knowing the ways but walking in the ways a big difference god showers his blessings on the just and the unjust and it doesn't matter how god uses you how many times he can use you that has nothing to do with knowing god's ways right it's true yeah they could say yeah our shoes didn't wear out that's not the way he's talking about but god he performed these miracles i was sick i looked to the to the stick and i got healed that's not the ways that he's talking about because jesus said they have not known my ways what ways is he talking about right it's not having these experiences with god that's knowing his ways god has a way for us to walk in amen this is his word he wants us to walk in all the word amen that's his way amen i am the way the truth and the life he says they air in their heart they always air in their heart the air was in their heart the heart is deceitful above all things who can know it it takes god even to show us what's in our heart amen they didn't know god's way god's way of trying his children god is allowed to put us through tests and trials because he wants to prove who we are the same son that made moses the meekest man ever amen that same son made pharaoh so hard that he wanted to kill trials prove what's on the inside of us it's important to know god in the middle of your trials it's important to know god's ways in the middle of the fire when he sends you through the fire and you're being tested and he allows persecutions in your life and things to happen that's when you got to know your god amen so you keep walking forward in praise and confidence that he's taking you through because he will claim you as his house whose house you are if you hold your confidence steadfast to the end that means it doesn't matter what you're going through i'm still going to be in this image i'm still going to be in this lightness i'm still going to be ready we think this is not a big deal but it's a huge deal because character is developed in the trials you know we can talk about the the wonderful times of rejoicing in all the but that has nothing to do with it it's important that we know god in our lives what we're going through what's happening this is knowing god this is knowing something has got to hold us something's got to anchor us gonna keep us from the murmuring the complaining and wishing things were different joshua and caleb said though though he slay me i yet i'll trust them i'm still gonna walk with them there's still a mountain for me they kept their eyes on the promise we're going through a lot of junk in this world but i tell you what's so scary he says i swear in my wrath that they shall not enter into my rest god put up with her nonsense for 40 years unconditional love that's our god but he made a decision at the end to keep himself from them think about that statement he made a decision to keep himself from them we know it as he kept them from the promised land but what is the promise then what's our promised land that's right i don't want god to make a decision to keep me from him amen the promised land for them was rest from their enemy it was the completion of god's promise amen right i'm going to take you out of egypt i'm going to put give you in the land it wasn't some something haphazard he did afterwards it was all part of the promise the promised land is rest our promised land is rest from our ungodly nature amen it's when we can possess the gate of the enemy that gets in there and tries to control us and make us feel things and do things that we don't want to do of course we can't we can't defeat the devil but christ in me can defeat the devil amen listen to what brother branham said in the message adoption part two he says now we have a promise because our promise is a spiritual rest he said theirs was a physical rest he says but the man outside of canaan knows nothing of it he's still wandering not saying that he's not a good man i don't say that i don't say even the man even in egypt's not a good man but until he's come over here into the possession he just doesn't know and the possession that the promise that was given to the church is not a natural land but a spiritual land for we are the royal priesthood a holy nation then in this royal priesthood this holy nation peculiar people called out elected chosen and set aside then all the world is dead on the outside all of it i'll tell you i got some more dying out to do just being honest and we are led by the spirit sons and daughters of god are led by the spirit of god not by man but by the spirit now listen to this now he goes and he's going to really describe this promised land i just love this and all in love the whole thing is bundled up now but the thing i want to try to get to you is this how he's going to describe the promised land the man that is in christ with the holy ghost can bear with a man when he's wrong long suffering gentle patient he's sweet he's humble he's faithful he's filled with the spirit never negative always positive he's a different person now that's the holy ghost that's the promised land that's our rest right there it can't be described any better than that it ain't saying i belong to church i'm in the message i've been saved i've been no that doesn't have nothing to do with it god did this for me no that does nothing to do with it are you manifesting the fruit of christ are you abiding in christ he said not just a man that we once had it if we shouted we had it us methodists all when we shouted we we was in the land that's good that's all right i believe that too then the pentecostals come along speaking with tongues they they had it everyone spoke with tongues had it i believe that too but still we found out that a lot of them didn't have it you see we're now coming down to this great hidden mystery that's been hid since the foundation of the world and now being revealed in the last days to who to the sons of god you believe that to be true the sons of god are manifested they're manifested oh i love that amen and he quotes this romans 8 19 for the earnest expectation of the creature waiteth for the manifestation of the sons of god so what do we what what's the what are we going to manifest some badge god's chosen me with earnest expectations the whole creation is waiting for the manifestation see the manifestation what is the manifestation is the making known now the whole world the muhammad's out yonder they're looking for it all around everywhere they're looking for it where are these people we've had it we've had the mighty rushing wind we've had the thunders the lightnings we've had the oil and the blood we've had all kinds of things but we failed to hear that little still small voice that attracted the prophet that was wrapped up in the robe around him and walked out and said here am i lord see the whole creation is groaning and waiting for the manifestations of the sons of god so brother brandon says that still small voice speaking in our hearts that we are the ones that have been called to manifest christ the word in flesh again and he says but the thing i want you to try to try to get to you is this that a man that is in christ i'm just re quoting this with the holy ghost can bear with one another when he's wrong long-suffering gentle patient he's sweet he's humble he's faithful filled with the spirit never negative always positive he's a different person now all these things are truly the love of god manifested those are just the manifestations of the love of god the i believe that the children of god are going to manifest perfect love amen amen that's the fruit of the spirit now that's the promised land that brother brandon said that the best thing he also went on one place he said you know there's a lot of theologians that have tried to hit this and they can do a pretty good job but the main thing i'm trying to get to you is this we put so little emphasis on living the life now you can't live that life that's being talked about if everything is sweet and dandy and everybody's loving on you and you got all kinds of money and you're very popular well it's very hard to manifest those things but go through a trial go through the wilderness and manifest what joshua and caleb did amen that's where you see it amen the believers have always erred in their heart not knowing my ways this is the way that god's talking about it's this life that you live not the experiences that you've had with god but the life that you're living so i swear in my wrath they shall not enter into my rest what a heartbreak what a judgment call it wasn't good many will come to me that day and say lord lord didn't i have all these experiences with you but i never knew you they didn't know his ways verse 12 take heed brethren lest there be in any of you an evil heart of unbelief and departing from the living god so when i talk about departing from the living god i'm talking about departing from holding on to your rejoicing firm to the end amen as soon as you you stop rejoicing you know what happens when you stop rejoicing you start a little murmuring start a little complaining you know what this isn't right i don't like that i don't like how you know this or that about this or that i don't want to say anything but you understand what i'm saying it's easy to begin to murmur and complain if you depart from the rejoicing you you depart from from holding your confidence steadfast to the end now our promise we should be our whole vision should be taking over this ungodly nature that's where our whole vision should be not what we can gain more knowledge or no more mysteries or have a more of a hallelujah service i tell you i want to leave here and i want to better live the life i want about when when the chips are down i want just christ to pour out of me i don't want to have to work at it i want christ just to i want to enter into that rest want christ to do it for me but how many believers have let go their confidence that they will manifest christ maybe in the heat of the battle maybe when their face is slapped or maybe when they've been taken advantage of used or abused how many believers have left their confidence and their rejoicing slip away god is defining this the scriptures is defining this as an evil heart of unbelief now if these if the children of israel would have held on to it yes we're more than able to take the land we're more than able to be an overcomer christ died that he might live inside of me and overcome my flesh if they could have just held on to that they wouldn't been fearful are you with me but it always starts in the heart the air always starts in the heart not the mouth the heart before you know it things start to slip out of the mouth god has a spiritual rest for us all the enemies have to be kicked out and we got to be the one to say get behind me satan the gates that were once occupied by an ungodly nature have been taken over by the holy ghost because remember the children of israel they didn't take the giants it was god who fought the battle right all they had to do was believe they they what'd they do they held on to the rejoicing they walked around the walls of jericho seven times rejoicing blow the trumpets walk seven times all you do is obey hold their confidence god is somehow going to do it the walls came down so i'll tell you i don't care what's going on in your life i don't care how negative it is how bad i if it's not of god god is more than able but you got to hold your confidence nobody can live that for you nobody can believe for you joshua came to believe with all their heart but they could not believe for a 1.8 million people you've got to believe it for yourself don't none go with me still i'll follow amen amen you got to hold it to the end i know we're going through tremendous things tremendous things and more is coming it's gonna be a squeeze we gotta hold on turn with me to hebrews chapter four verse nine there remaineth therefore a rest to the people of god there's a rest for us for he that has entered into his rest he also have seized from his own works as god did from his in other words you don't have to try to stop drinking right you don't have to work at it no you you enter into christ and it is his work that takes care of it he takes it out of you because he already paid for it at calvary it's his life inside of you you've now entered into his rest it's now christ in you the hope of glory he's taken over i love this verse verse 11 let us labor therefore to enter into that rest how much time are we spending trying to enter into the holy ghost you know what are we waiting for waiting for somebody to generate it at church waiting for it to happen when you pop on the tape after you go through the motions no we need a labor we need a laborer there's too much formality need to cry out to god i'll tell you when the children of israel cried out to god god came and saved them as soon as they stopped crying out because they had it they started complaining they didn't start crying out they started complaining about things we got to keep crying out for god god come have your way in my life lord labor to enter into it read listen to the tapes rapturing faith lies in those tapes labor labor labor don't just come to church right it's true learn to labor with your life [Music] lest any man fall after the same example of unbelief when you're laboring to enter into your rest you're moving forward with confidence you're rejoicing you're thanking god for the promise thank you lord i'm an overcomer i can do all things through you christ but if you're not doing that you're falling after the same example of unbelief and you don't even realize it the children in israel didn't realize it what was going to happen to them if they knew they were going to be doomed 40 years ago they probably would have quit the devil he don't want us to know what we're doing when we're doing the wrong thing i know that to be the truth what an exhortation keep laboring until all of christ is manifested inside of us don't be satisfied for how much you know of god don't just brag about your shoes not wearing out and the miracles that have been happening you know last year these had 40 years of miracles to talk about that wasn't joshua and caleb's attitude don't let your confidence slip away don't fall after that same example i'm so glad we have this in the word to tell us how we need to be verse 12 just hold on to god's word of promise for the word of god is quick it's powerful it's sharper than any twitch or a piercing even the dividing son of the soul spirit and the joints and the marrow and is a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart all we need is to rely on the word of god if god's word said it i believe it amen it can cut that devil right out of us it's so powerful it's so sharp it can discern whether our motives are right or wrong when the prophet said check your motives that means you can know your motive if you want to know bad enough amen now i'll tell you the majority of the time i'm going to be honest with you do you remember this the majority of the time our motives are mixed and that's what makes it so difficult to discern but if we take time to say lord i'm i don't want no wrong motives search my heart lord i want this to be pure clean i want to only be you it takes that neither is there any creature that is not manifest in his sight but all things are naked and open unto the eyes of him of whom we have to do now look at this wonderful verse seeing then that we have a great high priest that is passed into the heavens jesus the son of god let us hold fast our profession don't let one ounce of complaining negativity murder ever be among you among you you are the children of god we don't do that get it out of your life get it out of your home get it out of your conversation take a stand you know that devil will try to slip in there and then they always say that's not no big thing it's just you know you all have you know down days and before you know it you got down weeks and then down months and then a down year so the lord is warning the believer here in hebrews chapter 3 verse 12 take heed brother blessed there be in any of you an evil heart of unbelief in departing from the living god or just letting go of your rejoicing that you're going to manifest all of christ but exhort one another look at this verse 13. we have now the job of helping one another but exhort one another daily while it's called day lest any of you be hardened through the deceitfulness of unbelief just a little unbelief not a big deal you can become hardened for we are made partakers of christ if we hold the beginning of our confidence that fast to the end we can't let the things of the world get us down amen we can't let the trials that we're going through understand that the things that you're going through in life are similar to the things that the children of israel went through in the wilderness we're being tested we're being proven yeah we're living in a scientific age it wasn't scientific back then but yet the testing is to prove who we are a complaint back then is the complaint in 2022 right a murder back then is a murmur here that's what god's looking at he's looking at what we are he would never put anything on us that we couldn't bear that's not our god god would only put on us what we can bear so there's never ever an excuse or a reason to complain i'll just say it like this tell the devil to get behind you get behind me saying i ain't listening to you and listen to those thoughts you gotta labor to enter into that rest it ain't gonna fall on your lap god is not some santa claus i'm all for the testimonies and confidence that we have in god at those times of rejoicing i'm all for the things that god has done for us and we need more testimonies we really do i'm all for the the songs of zion i'm all for lord lord he's my lord but it's got to go beyond that it's got to go beyond that saints we stopped there and we feel like the children of israel felt i got god's with us we got to moses intercedes for us god listens to him he listens to god he bails us out every time we're complaining we don't got the same old preacher preaching the same old manna they just want meat you're getting a good month next month a good dose of other than john martin but he bailed him out gave him meat and then that got him in trouble god made a promise to us saints and it's up to us to hold our confidence until we manifest all of christ that should be our goal i know we got other things going on in life we want other situations taken care of we're but you know what we need to focus on what's the main thing and that god is building a house inside of us and he wants this house to be complete he doesn't want the windows open and crack in the roof and this problem over here god wants a complete house first john chapter three verse two first john chapter three verse two says beloved now are we the sons of god and it doth not yet appear what we shall be but we know that when he show up here we're gonna be like him for we're gonna see him as he is we've been called and we've been predestinated to this image so where is the rejoicing of this hope shouldn't we be rejoicing shouldn't be focusing on manifesting this shall we just be excited for the things that god has uh delivered you from in your lives and the fruit of the spirit that you can honestly uh be hated be talked behind your back slap everything else and you can still love that person shouldn't there be some rejoicing going on yes what are we waiting for for everybody to start being nice before we're gonna like shine in his image it don't happen like that verse three and every man that has this hope you got this hope in him purifies himself there's a labor to enter into that rest there's i i want to be an overcomer i want to shine for jesus i want to be joshua and caleb i want every promise in the book it's mine i want to stand with the lord's despised view colossians chapter 1 verse 26 we just need to hold our confidence and are rejoicing firm to the end amen firm amen don't ever come in the church and just feel like okay i'm here at church now what verse 26 even the mystery which had been hid from ages and from generations but now is made manifest to his saints okay now we're just keeping in mind the whole earth is groaning waiting for the manifestations of the sons of god to whom god would make known what is the riches of the glory of this mystery among the gentiles which is christ in you the hope of glory no brother brandon went on to say hey the methodist said they had it when they shouted penick also said they had it when they spoke in tongues so i'm not going to be satisfied until i see christ more in my life i'm focusing on what i am to be what this word tells me i should be living not how far i've come right and being satisfied like i've attained i haven't detained about pressing towards amen that mark for the prize of the high calling whom we preach warning every man and teaching every man in what all wisdom what's the purpose of doing this that we may present every man perfect in christ jesus i do not want the lord saying i swear my wrath you're not going to enter in because of my murmuring am i complaining and and not focusing on what's important to god it's important to god that i manifest christ it wasn't important to the children of israel that they went into that promised land crazy but think about it if i if i have a thousand dollars i'm going to give you and you won't take it how's that going to make me feel no i don't want it i don't want i want your money god gave us a promise gave the children of israel promised and they didn't want it because they feared they weren't strong enough to what to believe to overcome that's why we need to exercise our faith that's why we need to get into the message listen to the tapes read the word faith cometh by hearing and hearing the word of god we need to build ourselves up in the most holy faith we need labor to enter into that rest we can't fall after the same example of unbelief amen that's why we warn every man teach every man verse 29 word to i also labor striving according to his working which worketh in me my day how many want god working you mightily amen hebrews chapter two verse one well i need to get going because it's you know getting at the end you know and i need to go faster now hebrews chapter 2 verse 1 therefore you and i you and i ought to give the more earnest heed to the things which we have heard lest at any time we should let them slip for if the word spoken by angels was steadfast and every transgression and disobedience received a just recompense of reward how shall we escape how are we going to escape if we neglect that means to be careless or to make light of so great a salvation which at the first began to be spoken by the lord and was confirmed unto us by them that heard them god also bearing the witness both with signs and wonders and divers miracles and gifts of the holy ghost according to his own so god gave those children of israel everything signs wonders he was with them but they became careless they neglected they made light of that's why i'm so against the doctrines of just you know once saved all we saved like they don't doesn't matter what they do afterwards they're saved well god saved the children of israel but afterwards he destroyed them that should put the fear of god in those believers but you know satan comes to church too he's working in the minds of the people trying to get them to compromise and that's not necessary that's a little too strict and that's just brother sullen so that's just a man and you know god is with me and no we need to fear the lord it is the beginning of wisdom amen all right i like to try to get going on a positive note with all this if i could hebrews chapter 10 verse 30. hebrews chapter 10 verse 30. lord help us to get through this because it's always the you know the best part i never get to the best part for we know him that have said vengeance belongeth unto me i will recompense saith the lord and again the lord shall judge his people now i don't understand why people want to judge others the lord is the one that judges his people i don't understand how people don't plead for mercy more for others if vengeance belongs to the lord why do we try stealing it away from god like i want to do it that don't belong to you don't steal it from god if the lord is going to judge his people then why do we judge god's people if god is going to make recompense who are we to try to take advantage and punish somebody or avenge somebody it's not our job it's god's okay so verse 31 it is a fearful thing to fall into the hands look at this of a living god we're going back to this living god not a dead letter not some god way over there but god that's living inside of us amen but call to remembrance of formal things in which after you were illuminated ye endured a great fight of afflictions partly while you were made a gang stock both uh by reproaches and afflictions and partly uh wealth ye became companions of them that were so used so i'll tell you we've all gone through some terrible things amen for ye have had compassion of me in my bonds and took joyfully the swallows of your goods knowing in yourselves that you have in heaven a better and enduring substance cast not away therefore your confidence which have great recompense of reward free of need of patience the children of israel had need of patience and they didn't do the will of god but ye of need of patience that after after ye have done the will of god ye might receive the promise so what we're go the things that we're going through god has given us time to handle it the right way to keep rejoicing believing in the promise so we can receive the promise of christ in me if christ is so filled inside of you you don't care if they're burning your body you don't care what they're doing to you they could be stoning you like they did stephen you would be still saying father forgive them christ and you the hope of glory even here on this earth for yet a little while and he that shall come will come and will not tarry that's our promise saints now the just shall live by faith but if any man draw back my soul shall have no pleasure in him keep rejoicing don't complain but we are not of them hallelujah who draw back unto perdition but of them that believe to the end to the saving of the soul today is the day of salvation amen don't say well i was saved back 20 years ago i could i could beat you i can i would say before the foundation of the world but today is the day of salvation today god is wanting to prove us today we are none of them that draw back or shrink from into some church formality sitting on a pew only saying amen to our favorite scriptures or our personal agendas or the things that we agree with the most blending in with others being satisfied with just a fellowship no sir we believe in the power of god that's going to take us through we're not a people that believe in slipping into lukewarm state of complacency in this age we're not of laodicea amen we're none of them who are are content with how much they're manifesting christ we're part of the group that will not be satisfied until they awake in his likeness amen we're not a van that act like we've attained we've apprehended we're spiritual enough no sir we press towards the mark we keep pressing towards the mark we're not proud and arrogant and uncaring of others no we're humble and we're living our life for others we believe in saving souls we don't we're not of those that sit on the seat of the scornful judging others while making excuses for the things that we do we're out of those that are forsaking the cement of ourselves together but we're of that group that are actually exhorting one another helping one another let's go my brother let's go my sister i know you got this going i know it's a big thing in your life but you got to press into christ i'll say it if you could come to church and all you had to do was come to church and you'd manifest more christ than if you went in a barn you turn into a horse or an air barn you turn into a goat you have got to take the word that you hear don't let it slip but labor to enter into it believe it with all your heart until you see it manifested this is the word of life that's being ministered first john chapter 2 verse 19. they went out from us but they were not of us for if they had been of us they would no doubt have continued with us but they went out that they might be made manifest that they were not all of us we got to stay with the word i want you to write this down because i don't got time to read it numbers 32 6 to 13. you read that when you get home okay numbers 32 6 to 13 or tomorrow when you have time but turn with me if you would to joshua chapter 14 joshua 14 chapter or verse 6 then the children of judah came unto joshua and gilgal and caleb this under junipeth the kenzite said unto him thou knowest the thing that the lord said on to moses the man of god concerning me and thee so i hope that you can remember what the lord spoke to your heart to the prophet of this age because it ain't changing this is many years now well look verse 7 40 years old was i when moses the servant of the lord sent me from kadesh barnia to spy out the land and i brought him word again and it was in my heart nevertheless my brethren i love that he called him brethren i love it that went up with me made the heart of the people melt but i wholly followed the lord my god there's a difference between everybody and you you are not stopping you are holy following the lord no matter what happens you're going through and moses swear on that day saying surely the land where unto thy feet of trodden shall be thine inheritance and thy children forever because thou has holy fall the lord my god not because you know he yeah he could say because he was predestinated and it would be a true statement but the thing is what does that mean it means holy following the lord the elect will holy follow the lord they will and now behold the lord have kept me alive as he said these forty and five years so he's 85 now even since the lord spake this word unto moses excuse me well the children of israel wandered in the wilderness just did not really know god's ways just experiencing things with god but not knowing his ways and now lo i am this day for score 85 years old as yet i am as strong this day as i was in the day that moses sent me to spout the land as my strength was then even so is now my strength now for war both to go out and to come in how many times did you barely make it in the church [Laughter] remember you're a joshua you're a caleb now therefore give me this mountain oh i love that attitude whereof the lord spake in that day for thou heardest in the day that the amicrites were there and that the cities were great and fenced if so be the lord will be with me then i shall be able to drive them out as the lord said and joshua blessed him and gave unto caleb the son of jeffudini hareb for in a heritance he kept his eyes on the promise for 45 years but he didn't have anybody supporting him just joshua and caleb that was them that was it everybody else was just murmuring complaining at church amen god is not forgetting his promise if everybody around you forgets you stay with the word stay with the promise god has promised you that you will awaken his likeness you will be like christ before he comes that's your promise that should be your interest amen arab therefore became the inheritance of caleb the son of japheth the kazanite unto this day because that he verse 14 because one reason because he had wholly followed the lord god of israel so today let's stand together today i ask this question are we wholly following the lord remember there were 1.8 million people that thought they were following the lord holy i am so i am so needy lord to be more like you share all my rights away in this world of sin i am [Music] i am amen let's close our [Music] eyes all my rights away every one lord in this world of [Music] sin i am so needy [Music] amen as she continues to play back quietly [Music] if i could just get you to close your eyes and maybe just focus not on me and focus on the lord for just a moment i want you to ask yourself this question because that's all that matters too it does not matter to anybody to the person next to you but are you fully following the lord have you let murmuring and complaining slip in have you let slip your rejoicing in your confidence i believe that god just wants us back on the right track god just wants us to surrender our all to him rededicate refocus on the promise that god has for us that he's called us to manifest him i know the trials that we go through the things that we we face are very difficult they're very hard god knows that that doesn't mean god's not with us but god wants us to keep rejoicing that he's going to take us through he's going to see us through he's going to see us through every test every trial i want you to visualize yourself as the brother of joshua or the or a sister of caleb i want you to visualize yourself as as one that is holding your confidence steadfast to the end that you're you're not going to entertain or listen to the thoughts of the enemy or be used by the enemy but you have an answer you can tell the devil to get behind you i'm going through i'm moving forward oh what a beautiful course lord share all my rights away lord help me to labor to enter into your wrath lord help me to set aside some more time put away my busy schedule to get interested in in some of the things that are lacking in my life so things are lacking in my house things are lacking in my uh manifesting your image lord to others help me with my my temper lord help me with my maybe i'm just not being sweet like i ought to be maybe i'm not being merciful enough maybe i'm not being able to bear with somebody who's who's doing me wrong but lord i'm focusing today on this lord i'm praying today i'm consecrating myself today i'm asking you today lord rekindle that in me lord fill me with a greater portion of your spirit that i that i may labor to enter into that rest the way i should lord lord you got my attention i've yielded to you i've not i i've i've lord i'm giving you myself i'm asking you to take away this hardness of my heart that i might have ears to hear lord what your spirit is saying to me just call on god just pray to him this is between you and him praise you lord jesus god we're here in your presence today lord your children lord there's taken a stand for you lord they're wanting to be found pleasing to the very end they wanted to conduct themselves and carry themselves lord through every test and every trial that you would put them through shining forth as a joshua shining forth as a caleb manifesting you in this late hour lord oh god we think of not only joshua caleb we think of our brother job oh a man that you tested but a man that stayed true lord to you oh god you told us to remember the patience of job god help us to be patient the things we're going through knowing lord that we have a reward waiting for us at the other side grounded lord jesus hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah we cast our cares upon you lord we yield ourselves to you lord we thank you for refocusing our attention upon you lord jesus [Music] do the work in this lord do the work in us lord jesus we're waiting upon you lord we're waiting on you come

he is here listen closely hear him hallelujah [Music] [Music] oh [Music] nobody knows [Music] [Music] oh [Music] hello [Music] crazy [Music] oh [Music] oh [Music] [Music] oh [Music] christ hallelujah
