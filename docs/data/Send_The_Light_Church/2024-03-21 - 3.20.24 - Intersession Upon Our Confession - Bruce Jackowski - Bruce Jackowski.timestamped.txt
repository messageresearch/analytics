[14:39] claim
[14:41] it though the way may seem long and the
[14:45] opposition strong for the bride there's
[14:49] a way
[14:52] provided if I plan to go through just to
[14:56] hope will not do I must be firmly
[15:03] decided to follow the Lord by obeying
[15:08] his word and believe that I'm one of the
[15:14] few I am one of the few yes I'm one of
[15:19] the few when by faith in God word I can
[15:23] claim
[15:24] it though the way may seem long and and
[15:29] the opposition strong for the bride
[15:32] there's a way
[15:35] provided if I plan to go through just to
[15:40] hope will not do I must be firmly
[15:46] decided to follow the Lord by obeying
[15:51] his word and believe that I'm one of the
[15:57] few and believe

[35:54] confession and tonight we confess all of
[35:56] our sins and our trespasses and the sins
[36:00] of our transgression the sin of omission
[36:04] whatever it might have been that we've
[36:05] done or said or thought that was
[36:08] displeasing to our Heavenly Father we
[36:10] now humbly come to the Lord Jesus and
[36:13] ask that his blood atone for our sins we
[36:16] didn't mean to do it Lord forgive us you
[36:19] know our hearts and we pray that you'll
[36:21] sanctify every person in here tonight
[36:23] with the holy's presence and may thy
[36:26] great August presence baptize everyone
[36:29] with the Holy Spirit and may great signs
[36:31] and wonders be wrought for the glory of
[36:34] God through doing this may The Sinner
[36:36] man or woman or the alien away from God
[36:39] may they come and sweetly and humbly bow
[36:42] at the foot of the cross and give their
[36:44] lives to him who died for this purpose
[36:47] for we ask it in his name amen amen you
[36:50] may be seated
[36:52] amen praise the Lord amen nobody can
[36:56] pray as good as brother brandom
[37:00] amen so I want to speak a little text
[37:05] out of verse one here where it says
[37:09] consider the Apostle and high priest of
[37:12] our
[37:13] profession the other day I was I was
[37:16] working out and normally when I get on
[37:19] my elliptical and and start running to
[37:23] keep my heart nice and healthy I put a
[37:26] tape on and brother Brandon it was it
[37:30] was preaching a message it was called a
[37:31] power of decision and in there he said
[37:34] living to make intercessions Upon Our
[37:38] confession and I got to thinking about
[37:40] that how that God can only move based on
[37:45] our
[37:46] confession amen hadn't really thought
[37:49] about it too much
[37:52] so Paul when he wrote here to the
[37:55] Hebrews I want you to just notice he
[37:56] says where for Holy Brethren partakers
[37:59] of the Heavenly calling and that's us
[38:02] amen it's a blessing that God knows us
[38:05] as holy Brethren partakers of the
[38:07] Heavenly calling he says consider the
[38:10] Apostle and the high priest of our
[38:13] profession Christ Jesus who was faithful
[38:16] to him that appointed him Jesus was
[38:20] faithful to God himself
[38:23] amen he says as also Moses was faithful
[38:26] in all of his house for this man was
[38:29] counted worthy of more Glory than Moses
[38:32] in as much as he who hath built the
[38:35] house hath more honor than the house
[38:38] itself amen you can always tell the
[38:41] quality of the house based on the
[38:43] Builder some Builders are big well-known
[38:47] but they build junk
[38:49] houses it is it's very true I'm not
[38:52] going to say any names
[38:54] but
[38:56] amen so he says every house is built by
[39:00] some man but he that built all things is
[39:03] God and Moses verily was faithful in all
[39:06] of his house as a servant for the
[39:09] testimony of those things which were to
[39:11] be spoken after so Moses he had a office
[39:14] that he was supposed to fulfill and he's
[39:16] referred to as the
[39:18] lawgiver and he was faithful in giving
[39:21] the law but that as far as he could take
[39:25] the children of God Amen
[39:28] he says but Christ as a son over his own
[39:32] house whose house we are praise the
[39:37] Lord praise the Lord amen If We Hold
[39:41] Fast the confidence and the rejoicing of
[39:44] the Hope firm unto the end so we just
[39:48] want I I was in the office and I was
[39:50] reviewing my notes and all of a sudden I
[39:54] realized I was like I'm as guilty as
[39:56] brother
[39:59] I said oh my we're not talking about the
[40:02] high priest we're talking about
[40:06] confession and that God is making
[40:09] intercession for you based on your
[40:14] confession so we're going to just zero
[40:17] in on that there's much to be said about
[40:19] Jesus Christ the high priest but first
[40:22] we need to go back and look in Leviticus
[40:24] chapter 16 we need to look we're going
[40:26] to read just a few scriptures
[40:31] here and this is when the high priest
[40:33] was first revealed up to this time there
[40:37] was not a high priest there was not
[40:40] there was not an approach to God they
[40:43] they knew God as the pillar of fire and
[40:45] they knew God because God was in Moses
[40:48] doing things but they didn't know how to
[40:50] approach God you know when they went to
[40:53] the to mount C and they saw the Thunder
[40:55] and the lightning and everything else
[40:56] and they saw what God was they were all
[40:59] afraid and said don't speak to us let
[41:02] this man speak to
[41:04] us so God said okay this is what I'm
[41:07] going to do then so in verse 29 he says
[41:11] and this should be a statue for every
[41:14] what no I said verse 30 I'm sorry verse
[41:17] 30 for on that day shall the priest make
[41:20] an atonement for you to cleanse you that
[41:24] you may be clean from all of your sins
[41:27] for the Lord now you notice in this
[41:30] scripture just leave that up there when
[41:33] you right now there's lots of things
[41:35] that you can watch on the news about
[41:39] courts and who's in the courts and and
[41:42] you know things that are going on well
[41:44] the way a Court is set up is you have a
[41:47] judge you have a jury and then they have
[41:51] you the guilty party and then you have
[41:55] to plead your case but you're not
[41:57] allowed to plead your case the way the
[42:00] law is set up the law says this isn't
[42:03] the place for you to talk and if you can
[42:06] afford an attorney we will provide you
[42:10] an attorney and your attorney will talk
[42:13] for you and if you jump up and you start
[42:16] beating on the table and everything else
[42:18] while the proceedings going on the judge
[42:20] has the right to say sit down this isn't
[42:23] a place for you your attorney's got the
[42:26] floor
[42:29] so if you notice that's exactly what
[42:31] verse 30 says verse 30 says on that day
[42:35] shall the priest make an atonement for
[42:38] you you can't go in and make an
[42:41] atonement for yourself you'd like to
[42:43] plead your case before God but you
[42:46] can't you cannot plead your case before
[42:49] God because all men is
[42:52] guilty man has no right to no right to
[42:55] even approach God right
[42:58] I mean if a Holy Angel is filthy in his
[43:02] sight where are we even
[43:04] standing amen
[43:07] amen so he says on that day the day that
[43:11] that priest will make an atonement for
[43:13] you to cleanse you that you may be clean
[43:16] from all your sins before the Lord it
[43:18] shall be a Sabbath of rest unto you
[43:20] praise the Lord it'll be a time when you
[43:23] no longer are worried about whether I'm
[43:27] I am righteous or
[43:29] not because it when you find out that
[43:33] God has has a high priest has somebody
[43:36] who's going to make an atonement for
[43:38] your sins and he has accepted that to
[43:41] cleanse you in his sight he said you're
[43:43] going to rest it's going to be a Sabbath
[43:46] to you
[43:48] amen and you shall afflict your souls by
[43:52] a statute forever and the reason that
[43:55] you afflict your souls is because your
[43:57] soul is very
[44:01] prideful given the first chance it gets
[44:04] up and says look at that I'm free from
[44:06] [Laughter]
[44:09] sin but Moses God told Moses he said no
[44:12] no it'll be a Sabbath but you should
[44:15] afflict your soul
[44:17] forever and the priest whom he shall
[44:20] anoint so see even the priest has to be
[44:23] anointed by a higher power
[44:27] I want you to notice how this is worded
[44:29] in verse 32 it says the priest whom he
[44:32] shall anoint and whom he shall
[44:35] consecrate to minister in the priest's
[44:38] office in his father's stead shall make
[44:41] the atonement and shall put on the linen
[44:43] clothes even the holy garments amen and
[44:47] he shall make an atonement now watch
[44:50] watch this he shall make an atonement
[44:53] for the holy
[44:55] Sanctuary that's the inner place and he
[44:58] shall make an atonement for the
[45:00] Tabernacle of the
[45:02] congregation and he shall make an
[45:04] atonement for the Altar and he shall
[45:07] make an atonement for all of the priests
[45:10] the priests can't even make an atonement
[45:12] for themselves only the high priest can
[45:15] do
[45:16] this amen and for all the people of the
[45:21] congregation and this should be an
[45:23] everlasting statute unto you to make an
[45:26] atonement for the children of Israel for
[45:29] all their sins once a year and he did as
[45:32] the Lord commanded Moses
[45:35] Amen brother Brenham said as I was with
[45:38] with Moses he says remember he can never
[45:41] do anything for you until first you have
[45:45] to say he's done
[45:47] it you have to believe him it's called
[45:51] client
[45:53] privilege whatever you say in the secret
[45:56] chamber in the closet between you and
[45:59] God is between you and
[46:02] God and in that that bond between you
[46:06] and God cannot be
[46:09] broken they can come and say oh no no no
[46:11] we want to know what what did he say in
[46:13] the secret place don't talk to me talk
[46:16] to my
[46:17] lawyer talk to my high
[46:20] priest but at the same time if I refuse
[46:24] to talk to my high priest my high priest
[46:28] is bound he can't defend
[46:32] me what if I go in and and I I get a
[46:36] high priest and he comes in and he says
[46:39] Bruce I'm here to represent
[46:45] you well Bruce did you do it or not I
[46:48] don't need to talk to you who are you I
[46:52] didn't pay for you what do you
[46:55] want he can't do anything for you how do
[46:58] you want me to plead your
[47:01] case I don't care how you plead my
[47:04] case you see you bind his hands up you
[47:08] make it to where he can't do brother
[47:11] brandom said so remember he can never do
[47:13] anything for you until first you say
[47:16] that he has done it believe him and
[47:19] accept it and testify it do you know
[47:22] that he's the high priest of our what
[47:24] our
[47:25] confession Hebrews 31 says now he's
[47:28] sitting at the right hand of the father
[47:31] to make
[47:32] intercessions Upon Our
[47:35] confession if we have the wrong type of
[47:38] confession how can he intercede for
[47:42] us if if we're praying for healing and
[47:46] then we walk out the door and you say
[47:48] well I don't know I know brother John
[47:50] anointed me with oil and all the
[47:51] brothers came up and prayed for me and
[47:53] you say brother that's what the
[47:55] scripture says do and you go oh yeah but
[47:57] I still feel really bad your
[48:00] confession is hindering his
[48:04] intercession he cannot intercede for you
[48:08] if you carrying around some of your sins
[48:10] we already saw in the opening scripture
[48:13] that the high priest will make atonement
[48:16] for your sins but if you're carrying
[48:18] around your sins you're binding him to
[48:22] where he can
[48:23] intercede if you come every day and say
[48:26] Lord I'm sorry I know I stole when I was
[48:31] a young boy and tomorrow I come back and
[48:34] sayl I'm sorry I I stole as young boy
[48:37] and he says but I forgive you he's
[48:40] making an intercession because you can't
[48:43] make
[48:44] intercession you there's no way that you
[48:48] can pray enough to what can wash away my
[48:51] sin right my intellect my studying the
[48:55] Bible praying fast until I
[48:59] die
[49:02] Faith
[49:03] confidence amen amen he's the high
[49:08] priest of our what our
[49:10] confession to make intercessions Upon
[49:13] Our confession you see we've got to
[49:15] believe it then accept it and then
[49:18] confess it and he's before the father to
[49:22] make good anything that we confess in
[49:24] the Redemptive blessings
[49:27] amen so you have to remember the high
[49:30] priest he makes an atonement for the
[49:32] believer he makes an atonement for the
[49:35] sanctuary he makes atonement for the
[49:37] Tabernacle of the congregation he makes
[49:39] an atonement for the altar he makes an
[49:42] atonement for the priesthood he makes an
[49:44] atonment for all the congregation it's
[49:47] mainly what I'm worried about is me I
[49:49] mean I like your brother Dennis but I'm
[49:51] not really worried about you I'm worried
[49:53] about
[49:55] me I'm worried about I'm very selfish
[49:58] when it comes to Salvation for
[50:03] me
[50:05] amen because I don't really care about
[50:08] how salvation affects you it's my life
[50:11] that's on the
[50:13] line if I don't if I don't confess the
[50:16] right thing and he cast me away from his
[50:19] presence he's not casting you away from
[50:21] his presence he's casting me
[50:24] away amen
[50:28] amen so Jesus is the high priest of our
[50:32] confession sitting at the right hand of
[50:35] God to make intercession Upon Our
[50:38] confession I know what King James says
[50:41] profess and confess he says it's the
[50:44] same word but it's a confession and he
[50:46] cannot do anything for you until first
[50:49] you believe
[50:51] it and then accept it amen it's
[50:56] wonderful to get baptized it's wonderful
[50:58] to ask Jesus Christ to be your savior
[51:00] it's wonderful to say come into my heart
[51:03] and everything else but until he accepts
[51:06] you and comes into your heart it's all
[51:09] in
[51:10] vain you're stepping in the right
[51:12] direction you're moving in the right
[51:14] direction but there's no partial Credit
[51:16] in this
[51:18] class we don't we don't give half points
[51:21] for showing up for church there there's
[51:24] you know there nothing like that It's
[51:26] All or Nothing
[51:29] amen amen you must believe it accept it
[51:33] and confess that it's right and then
[51:34] he's the high priest to make
[51:37] intercessions on what you confess that
[51:40] he has done for you and that's just as
[51:43] plain as I know the gospel frankly
[51:45] that's all I know that's the only gospel
[51:47] that there is is that that's what he
[51:50] said he said that's
[51:53] it so let's just take a look at some of
[51:56] this let's go to Hebrews
[52:01] 7
[52:03] amen praise the
[52:09] Lord in Hebrews 7 and verse 19 it says
[52:14] for the law made nothing perfect so I
[52:18] want you to remember that we're just
[52:19] we're going to talk a little bit about
[52:21] the high priest and the difference
[52:23] between the old levitical high priest
[52:26] and Jesus
[52:27] Jesus but we're not staying there
[52:30] because the thing that you need to
[52:31] remember tonight is that your walk with
[52:34] God is all based on your
[52:39] confession it's based on your confession
[52:43] if you hide your confession he can't
[52:48] move if you if you aren't willing to
[52:50] confess your sins he can't forgive you
[52:54] he just he can't if if you if you don't
[52:58] move in the right direction I mean the
[53:02] intercession when I I mean this was at
[53:06] the beginning I'm working out and I'm
[53:07] thinking about this I'm going I can't
[53:09] hear the rest of the tape because I'm
[53:11] thinking about I'm thinking about I am
[53:15] hindering God for interceding for me on
[53:20] my
[53:22] confession and I never really thought
[53:25] just about that
[53:27] Little
[53:30] Nugget verse 19 says for the law made
[53:33] nothing perfect but the bringing in of a
[53:37] better hope did so he Paul is telling
[53:40] them he says the law did absolutely
[53:43] nothing for us because it couldn't
[53:46] change us but it pointed that one day a
[53:50] perfect lamb would come and because we
[53:53] had that hope we could we had something
[53:56] forward to look forward
[53:58] to by he says and the bringing in of a
[54:01] better hope did and that is how or
[54:06] why how we draw nigh unto
[54:10] God and in as much as not without an
[54:14] oath he was made a priest so Paul starts
[54:17] to make this difference between a priest
[54:21] that was made by a
[54:24] bloodline election and a priest that was
[54:28] called into an office by an
[54:31] oath
[54:34] amen for those priests were made without
[54:37] an
[54:39] oath the priests in the Old Testament
[54:42] Aaron was chosen by God he was elected
[54:46] to be the high priest and then he was
[54:51] went through all of the the ritual and
[54:54] the ceremony and everything else
[54:57] and set up as the high priest and then
[55:00] when Aaron got old and died his son took
[55:05] over now when that son got old and died
[55:09] his son took over and then another son
[55:11] took over and another son took over and
[55:15] there was never any
[55:18] accounting about their
[55:21] relationship with
[55:24] God he says for those priests were made
[55:27] without an oath but this Jesus Christ
[55:31] with an oath by that by him which is God
[55:36] Elohim that said unto him the Lord swear
[55:40] and will not repent thou art a priest
[55:42] Forever After the order of
[55:44] MDC so the high priest in the Old
[55:48] Testament was a a Earthly priesthood
[55:53] that was based on flesh
[55:57] MDC now there's an interesting guy no
[56:01] father no mother No Beginning No End yet
[56:07] he
[56:09] existed and when God spoke to Jesus
[56:12] Christ he said thou art a priest not
[56:15] till you die but
[56:18] Forever After the order of
[56:21] MDC and by so much was Jesus made aurity
[56:25] of a better
[56:28] Testament Jesus Christ can do for
[56:31] you what brother John and brother Ron
[56:35] and me and brother Keith and if we all
[56:37] get together and pray for you we can't
[56:39] do for you what this high priest can do
[56:42] for
[56:43] you what this high priest can do don't
[56:48] make him
[56:50] mad don't lie to him I don't know why
[56:54] you try to lie to God anyways
[56:57] God knows
[56:58] amen and they truly were many priests in
[57:01] verse 23 so he says they truly were many
[57:05] priests because they were not suffered
[57:07] to continue by reason of
[57:11] death but this man Jesus Christ because
[57:14] he continu forever has an unchangeable
[57:19] priesthood praise the Lord can you
[57:22] imagine every year so okay so we got
[57:25] brother the pastor so brother John's
[57:28] going to be our high priest but one day
[57:30] brother John Dies so he's got to take
[57:33] his son because that's the only one that
[57:35] could be the next Pastor is his
[57:39] son so his son comes in and we vote him
[57:41] in well we don't vote him in God already
[57:44] did because the levitical law said
[57:46] so what kind of a relationship what kind
[57:49] of an attitude does he have towards God
[57:53] because if he follows all the rules and
[57:55] the regulations and goes in and puts
[57:57] Blood On The Mercy Seat God's Duty bound
[58:00] to accept
[58:03] him but Jesus
[58:06] Christ praise the Lord who is an
[58:10] unchangeable high priest
[58:15] amen wherefore he is able also to save
[58:19] them to the uttermost that come unto God
[58:23] by him seeing he ever liveth to make
[58:29] intercession for them Lord his whole
[58:32] life he's making intercession it doesn't
[58:35] say that about the levitical priesthood
[58:37] the levitical priesthood goes in one
[58:39] time puts Blood On The Mercy Seat comes
[58:42] out and says man I'm glad I lived
[58:44] through
[58:45] that because and you'll see you'll see
[58:49] Paul talks about he says for such a high
[58:51] priest became
[58:54] us the high priest stepped down from
[58:58] glory and became
[59:01] us and it's not that we Are Holy but he
[59:05] was holy he was harmless he was
[59:08] undefiled he was separate from Sinners
[59:11] cuz he was no he didn't even know sin he
[59:14] was separate from Sinners and he was
[59:16] made higher than the heavens that's my
[59:19] high
[59:20] priest
[59:23] amen who needeth not daily as those High
[59:27] priests those in the Old Testament to
[59:29] offer up
[59:30] sacrifice first for his own sins the
[59:33] priest got to atone for himself then
[59:36] he's got to atone for this the
[59:39] priesthood then he's got to atone for
[59:41] the Tabernacle then he's got to atone
[59:43] for all the goods he's got to do all of
[59:46] that continually year after year year
[59:49] after year he's going to come in and
[59:52] every once in a while they messed up cuz
[59:55] there were a couple of high priests who
[59:56] got killed there was also people who
[59:59] thought they could just hey I can just
[1:00:01] go in here and offer fire on the altar
[1:00:03] of God I have a i God knows me I'm the
[1:00:08] king
[1:00:11] amen first for his own sins and then for
[1:00:14] the peoples for this he did once when he
[1:00:18] offered up himself you see the
[1:00:19] difference Paul's talking about he says
[1:00:22] for Jesus Christ did this once when he
[1:00:25] offered up himself for the law maketh
[1:00:28] men High priests which have infir
[1:00:33] infirmity they you know and that means
[1:00:36] I'm
[1:00:37] sick right if you have an infirmity
[1:00:41] you're sick there's something wrong with
[1:00:43] you maybe you're missing an arm maybe
[1:00:46] you got a bad heart maybe you got
[1:00:48] therosis of the liver maybe your blood
[1:00:50] pressure is way too high but you could
[1:00:52] still be a high priest but Jesus Christ
[1:00:55] is
[1:00:56] perfect praise the Lord
[1:01:00] amen but the word of the oath see he
[1:01:03] said this oath that God made with him
[1:01:06] which was since the law maketh the son
[1:01:10] who is
[1:01:11] consecrated not for every year but
[1:01:16] forever praise God amen amen so turn
[1:01:20] back here to Hebrews 4 just one page
[1:01:24] back ver verse 14 it says seeing then
[1:01:29] then that we have a great high priest
[1:01:32] that is passed into the heavens Jesus
[1:01:34] the son of God let us hold fast our
[1:01:38] profession let us have a
[1:01:41] consistent confession yes you can't be
[1:01:44] in and out and up and down and left and
[1:01:47] right and everything else because every
[1:01:48] time you're in the down and the
[1:01:51] dumps you're hindering your intercessor
[1:01:55] your are hindering your lawyer from
[1:01:58] going to bat for you amen when you doubt
[1:02:01] him see that's why brother John just did
[1:02:05] a a good message on
[1:02:08] predestination but he also did a good
[1:02:10] message you know on
[1:02:12] the if if
[1:02:15] we well we we'll go into it
[1:02:20] later says for we have not a high priest
[1:02:24] which cannot be touched with the feeling
[1:02:26] of our
[1:02:28] infirmities but was in all points
[1:02:30] tempted like as we are yet without
[1:02:33] sin Let Us therefore come boldly into
[1:02:36] the throne of grace that we may obtain
[1:02:39] mercy and find Grace to help in time of
[1:02:43] need amen what good is it if you have a
[1:02:47] scripture but you never use
[1:02:49] it you never use
[1:02:51] it you need get a flat tire on the side
[1:02:54] of the road and you
[1:02:57] go get out of the car and you slam the
[1:03:00] door and then you open up the trunk and
[1:03:02] the spare is
[1:03:05] flat that's the
[1:03:08] time when the word of God should be in
[1:03:11] your
[1:03:12] mouth and say he is a present help in a
[1:03:16] time of
[1:03:18] trouble if I don't confess that he
[1:03:21] cannot intercede for
[1:03:24] me
[1:03:28] it
[1:03:31] cannot I want you to look at Romans
[1:03:35] 10
[1:03:37] amen and
[1:03:40] then praise the Lord
[1:03:46] amen in Romans
[1:03:49] 10 um verse
[1:03:52] 8 it
[1:03:54] says but what saith it the word is nigh
[1:03:59] thee even in thy mouth and in thy heart
[1:04:04] so if you don't read your Bible every
[1:04:06] day like like when I was a young
[1:04:09] Christian
[1:04:10] once I still feel like I'm pretty a
[1:04:15] failure but I was a young Christian once
[1:04:18] and the brother that I used to
[1:04:19] fellowship with a
[1:04:21] lot he said well I said well I know I'm
[1:04:24] born again because I said I've see the
[1:04:27] works so like on my way to getting born
[1:04:31] again I went to watch uh brother
[1:04:35] brandom's movie Deep call to the Deep so
[1:04:37] we went to a church and Don and I showed
[1:04:40] up and we were Sinners we were living
[1:04:43] together
[1:04:45] Sinners and and but there was something
[1:04:48] in me stirring about the end time and I
[1:04:52] got there and at the end this this
[1:04:55] preacher that played the song and played
[1:04:57] the movie the movie and then he sung a
[1:04:59] song and everything else he says if you
[1:05:01] want to change in your life he says come
[1:05:03] up here and stand and we'll pray for you
[1:05:04] well I I went up front and I felt like
[1:05:07] brother Brandon told the story but when
[1:05:09] I went up front well I was Presbyterian
[1:05:12] Presbyterians don't go up front we don't
[1:05:15] we just sit and go to whatever you go
[1:05:19] you know so I I came up front I put my
[1:05:22] hands together and uh and I
[1:05:26] I don't know any prayers Our Father are
[1:05:28] heart in heaven I know that I used to
[1:05:29] know the Apostles Creed but I don't I
[1:05:32] don't never pray to this who I don't
[1:05:34] even know who God is but there's
[1:05:36] something tugging inside of me because
[1:05:38] this man this man he got up we showed
[1:05:41] the movie and he got up and he said you
[1:05:43] know he
[1:05:44] says the devil we're like a cow on the
[1:05:48] end of a rope and he says the devil's
[1:05:50] got the other end of the rope and he
[1:05:52] says he'll let us graze around here but
[1:05:54] he says we can see that there's better
[1:05:56] grass over there and he says and every
[1:05:59] time we go over there he says he pulls
[1:06:00] on a rope and he said one day Jesus
[1:06:03] Christ came down and cut the rope and
[1:06:05] set us free and you know what crazy old
[1:06:07] brother Bruce did I shouted
[1:06:10] [Laughter]
[1:06:12] amen I didn't even know what that
[1:06:16] was and I came up front and I I this the
[1:06:20] guy came we prayed for us prayed for all
[1:06:23] of us and no lightning bolts nothing
[1:06:25] happened
[1:06:26] nothing I said okay went back sat down
[1:06:29] we all got in the car we're driving home
[1:06:32] they asked me about the movie and I said
[1:06:33] well I really wasn't impressed with the
[1:06:35] movie because I didn't see any Miracles
[1:06:37] I thought I going to see some Miracles I
[1:06:39] thought I was going to see you know the
[1:06:41] dead Ray I thought I but I said I didn't
[1:06:43] see any of that and and I said but I
[1:06:46] said it was I I believe I I do
[1:06:51] and about halfway through the next day I
[1:06:54] realized I was no longer
[1:06:57] swearing and I never swear
[1:07:02] since he's a faithful high
[1:07:05] priest later on when I got born
[1:07:08] again that wasn't born again that was
[1:07:11] God vindicating to me that he is
[1:07:13] real if he's never Vindicated to you
[1:07:16] real you better find him you better find
[1:07:19] him because he's got to be real to you
[1:07:21] can't be real to Mom or Dad or the
[1:07:24] Deacon board or the Pastor they don't
[1:07:27] work like that it's got to be real to
[1:07:29] you to make it to it to it
[1:07:32] work and then so so
[1:07:37] then I just
[1:07:39] know that so so later on I I was telling
[1:07:42] to this brother and he said well brother
[1:07:43] Ru says you got to read your Bible and
[1:07:45] pray every day and I
[1:07:47] said how thick that book
[1:07:51] is and it's pretty boring and I'm not
[1:07:55] going to read read it I mean and he goes
[1:07:57] well he says so God is a spirit right
[1:08:01] he's a
[1:08:02] spirit and he's the author of this
[1:08:06] word so I said if you don't read the
[1:08:09] word and get it inside of you and when
[1:08:14] you need help the Holy Spirit has
[1:08:17] nothing to anoint because he can only
[1:08:19] anoint his
[1:08:21] word and when he anoints his word it
[1:08:25] does exactly what Romans 10 says the
[1:08:28] word is nigh thee even in thy mouth and
[1:08:31] in thy
[1:08:33] heart and if it's in your heart then it
[1:08:37] will come out of your
[1:08:39] mouth if evil is in your heart it will
[1:08:42] come out of your
[1:08:44] mouth if unclean thoughts are in your
[1:08:46] mind it will come out of your
[1:08:49] mouth and your confession will hinder
[1:08:53] the work of the Holy Ghost amen
[1:08:57] verse 9 says that if Thou shalt confess
[1:09:00] with the mouth the Lord Jesus and shalt
[1:09:02] believe in thy heart that God has raised
[1:09:05] him from the dead Thou shalt be
[1:09:08] saved amen the only evidence that I have
[1:09:12] that he rose from the dead is the works
[1:09:14] that he's done inside of
[1:09:17] me because anybody's works that's done
[1:09:20] inside of somebody else doesn't
[1:09:23] count I mean it's wonderful it's
[1:09:25] wonderful brother Ryan you prayed and
[1:09:27] God did something for you but I want it
[1:09:29] for me that's what I want
[1:09:32] amen for with the heart man believeth
[1:09:36] unto righteousness and with the mouth
[1:09:39] confession is made unto
[1:09:42] salvation praise the Lord amen now turn
[1:09:45] back a couple more pages to Romans
[1:09:50] 8 so verse 26 says this and brother John
[1:09:54] just just taught on these scriptures two
[1:09:56] weeks ago he says but look verse 26 says
[1:09:59] likewise the spirit also helpeth our
[1:10:04] infirmities that's our mistakes our
[1:10:06] failures I can't get over my temper I
[1:10:08] can't get over my lusting thoughts I
[1:10:10] can't get over this I can't get over I I
[1:10:13] got I got these things these problems
[1:10:16] but the spirit of God can help you with
[1:10:20] your
[1:10:21] infirmities for we know not what we
[1:10:23] should pray for and as we
[1:10:26] ought but the spirit itself maketh
[1:10:30] intercession the spirit is the high
[1:10:33] priest he maketh
[1:10:35] intercession he goes before the father
[1:10:38] see Jesus Christ is just the veil Jesus
[1:10:43] Christ is just the the image of the
[1:10:47] invisible God but there's an invisible
[1:10:49] God that worked through that man amen
[1:10:53] and that invisible God has to have
[1:10:55] something to work through and so the
[1:10:58] spirit itself maketh intercession for us
[1:11:02] and he that searches the hearts knoweth
[1:11:07] what the mind is of the
[1:11:10] spirit God remember remember what he
[1:11:13] said there in Hebrews 3 he said the guy
[1:11:16] that built the house has got more power
[1:11:17] than the
[1:11:19] house and Jesus Christ is the author of
[1:11:22] the house whose house ye
[1:11:27] are amen I'm God's
[1:11:30] house amen praise the Lord Brother Denis
[1:11:34] he is I'm his
[1:11:36] house and he knows what the mind of the
[1:11:39] spirit is because he maketh intercession
[1:11:43] for the Saints according to the will of
[1:11:46] God and that answers a lot of problems
[1:11:49] because you pray and you say oh Lord
[1:11:51] pray I got to have this happen pray I
[1:11:53] need this I need this I need this but
[1:11:55] but when you confess if your confession
[1:11:58] is correct and he goes to the father
[1:12:02] because the the carcass the body that
[1:12:05] Jesus Christ is laying on the throne
[1:12:07] it's the bleeding lamb and the spirit is
[1:12:10] making
[1:12:12] intercession and the spirit so when
[1:12:15] Jesus's blood he can't see your mistakes
[1:12:19] brother brandom said that perfectly he
[1:12:21] says because he hears your voice but
[1:12:23] it's filtered through the body of Jesus
[1:12:25] Christ he says that's my son speaking to
[1:12:28] me his confession is right but you know
[1:12:31] what my will is my will is bigger than
[1:12:36] him and that's what the scripture
[1:12:39] says because he maketh intercession for
[1:12:42] the Saints according to the will of God
[1:12:47] not according to your
[1:12:48] will oh yeah we all want to live
[1:12:51] forever we do but we don't want to live
[1:12:54] forever old who wants to do
[1:12:59] that I mean I don't want to get older I
[1:13:02] want to live
[1:13:03] forever
[1:13:05] yes all right so let's
[1:13:09] uh so look down at verse 34 says so he
[1:13:14] says who is he that condemneth it is
[1:13:17] Christ that died yay rather that is
[1:13:21] risen again because none of us have
[1:13:24] right who is even at the right hand of
[1:13:27] God who also maketh intercession for
[1:13:31] us and if we confess the right
[1:13:36] things then God can move and make
[1:13:39] intercession for
[1:13:42] us so that's why the Bible says cast
[1:13:46] down imagination well everybody has an
[1:13:51] imagination and you'd be walking along
[1:13:53] and just imagination turns on it just it
[1:13:56] just turns
[1:13:57] on but if you haven't hid the word of
[1:14:00] God in your heart then there's nothing
[1:14:03] in there for the spirit to anoint to
[1:14:07] cast that thing
[1:14:08] down because you thought oh that's just
[1:14:11] me no cast it down if it doesn't line up
[1:14:14] with the word of God cast it down and he
[1:14:17] can make intercession he say he he say
[1:14:19] oh Father my son down there is having a
[1:14:22] problem with his imagination he needs a
[1:14:24] little more
[1:14:25] power and then he can he can give that
[1:14:29] to
[1:14:30] you because that's what the high priest
[1:14:33] does
[1:14:34] amen
[1:14:37] amen so I want to spend the next 20
[1:14:40] minutes or so speaking about Abraham now
[1:14:44] Abraham is known as the father of our
[1:14:49] faith
[1:14:52] amen and he was called by by God at 75
[1:14:58] years
[1:14:59] old how many people here are older than
[1:15:04] 75
[1:15:06] oh they're over
[1:15:08] there but that means the rest of us
[1:15:10] never even heard a voice of God
[1:15:13] yet think about
[1:15:16] that 75 was when God first spoke to
[1:15:21] Abraham before that he was nothing but
[1:15:25] uh Heathen did his own thing walked his
[1:15:29] own way did
[1:15:31] everything but his
[1:15:34] confession now notice also Abraham when
[1:15:38] Abraham was alive there was no high
[1:15:42] priest so when God called Abraham God
[1:15:45] became his high
[1:15:47] priest and everything that Abraham
[1:15:50] confessed God could intercede for
[1:15:53] him
[1:15:55] brother bramman Israel and the church he
[1:15:57] says so now I want you to notice that in
[1:15:58] the beginning of this is the beginning
[1:16:01] of Christianity of the
[1:16:04] church
[1:16:06] wow so I want you to notice it wasn't
[1:16:08] because Abraham was a good man it was
[1:16:12] because God elected and chose Abraham it
[1:16:15] wasn't Abraham choosing God it was God
[1:16:19] choosing Abraham can you see it so the
[1:16:23] very first question you have to ask
[1:16:24] yourself yourself if you are the
[1:16:26] children of of
[1:16:28] Abraham it's a hard question did you
[1:16:32] choose God or did God choose
[1:16:37] you because if God didn't choose you
[1:16:40] there's no
[1:16:47] hope God is he has to act you you
[1:16:52] know that he chose you amen amen thank
[1:16:56] you
[1:16:58] Lord it wasn't because Abraham was a
[1:17:00] good man it was because God elected and
[1:17:03] chose Abraham it wasn't Abraham choosing
[1:17:06] God it was God choosing Abraham can you
[1:17:08] see it and now watch now as it was then
[1:17:13] so is it
[1:17:14] today it isn't you choosing God it's God
[1:17:18] choosing you now this might be very
[1:17:20] strong but I want you to notice
[1:17:22] immediately after choice election it's
[1:17:26] separation from everything else as soon
[1:17:29] as he
[1:17:30] calls he elects then he calls and when
[1:17:33] he calls he separates you from
[1:17:36] everything that hangs on to
[1:17:39] you
[1:17:41] now that's God's
[1:17:44] program that proves it isn't a
[1:17:46] denomination it isn't two or three
[1:17:48] people together he he expects every
[1:17:52] individual amen it's an individual
[1:17:55] affair with every person
[1:17:58] amen
[1:18:00] so if you if we're not going to turn
[1:18:03] there but in Genesis 12 veres 1-3 God
[1:18:06] calls Abraham or calls Abram out of
[1:18:09] Earth the cheles he calls him and the
[1:18:12] very first thing now God called Abraham
[1:18:16] and Abraham confessed that he heard the
[1:18:20] voice of
[1:18:22] God and God
[1:18:25] moved on Abraham to help him leave his
[1:18:28] family because sometimes that's kind of
[1:18:30] hard to do but he took a lot with him
[1:18:32] anyways because he felt sorry for him he
[1:18:35] took a couple other people with him and
[1:18:37] he went on his way that's not the point
[1:18:42] the point is is that when he confessed
[1:18:44] that God had spoke to him God interceded
[1:18:47] for him and when he left the very first
[1:18:51] thing he did was he
[1:18:53] backslid
[1:18:55] famine came into land things got hard
[1:18:58] God never told him it was going to get
[1:18:59] hard never told him about that it got
[1:19:02] hard Abraham went down into Egypt lived
[1:19:05] down there told lies did all kinds of
[1:19:08] bad things but it never stopped the
[1:19:10] election of
[1:19:14] God when he came back then God he still
[1:19:19] had heard the voice of God he said I
[1:19:22] still believe God called me but God
[1:19:26] started to prosper him because he had
[1:19:29] that testimony that he believed God and
[1:19:31] God started to prosper him well then God
[1:19:35] made a contention between him and his
[1:19:38] buddy and he said you know what JN we we
[1:19:41] can't walk together anymore you got way
[1:19:44] too much money things aren't going well
[1:19:46] for us so because I'm a good Christian
[1:19:49] you pick whichever way you want to go
[1:19:51] and I'll go the other
[1:19:52] way and sometimes we think said this is
[1:19:55] horrible these have been friends I've
[1:19:57] had all through my whole life now all of
[1:19:58] a sudden I can't be their friend
[1:20:00] anymore cuz God wants you and him alone
[1:20:04] he don't want you and the pastor in
[1:20:06] between he doesn't want you and the
[1:20:08] Deacon board in between your wife in
[1:20:10] between he don't want anybody between
[1:20:12] you he wants you and him alone and he
[1:20:15] will bring things around oh you think
[1:20:17] he's going to destroy your marriage uh
[1:20:19] no I didn't say
[1:20:21] that he's not going to say that that
[1:20:24] ain't
[1:20:26] happening but God wants
[1:20:29] you to stay so he puts him under
[1:20:33] preparation Under
[1:20:35] Pressure he puts pressure on Abram the
[1:20:39] elect he puts pressure on him they get
[1:20:41] in a fight and they
[1:20:44] separate as soon as he separates and he
[1:20:48] follows the plan of
[1:20:49] God God comes down and reviews again
[1:20:55] the promise that he made to him when he
[1:20:58] first heard him he reviews the promise
[1:21:01] that I'm going to make you the father of
[1:21:03] many nations I'm going to bless you and
[1:21:05] everything
[1:21:07] else
[1:21:08] amen and he also tells him so we want to
[1:21:12] look at this one this is Genesis
[1:21:16] 13 because there's there's a nice
[1:21:22] little there is one in here
[1:21:26] brother brandom called it
[1:21:31] one in Genesis
[1:21:33] 13 starting with verse 14 it says and
[1:21:36] the Lord said unto Abram after that lot
[1:21:39] was separated from him lift up now thine
[1:21:42] eyes and look from the place where thou
[1:21:44] art northward Southward Eastward and
[1:21:48] Westward for all the land which thou
[1:21:51] seest to thee will I give it and to thy
[1:21:54] seed for ever and I will make thy seed
[1:21:57] as the dust of the earth so that if a
[1:21:59] man can number the dust of the earth
[1:22:01] then shalt thy seed also be numbered
[1:22:04] arise and walk through the land in the
[1:22:07] length of it and in the breadth of it
[1:22:09] for I will give it unto thee then Abram
[1:22:12] re removed his tent and came and dwelt
[1:22:14] in the plain of mamry which is in heon
[1:22:17] and built there an altar unto the Lord
[1:22:20] you will notice that there is no mention
[1:22:23] here of the the stars of
[1:22:28] heaven
[1:22:31] right but verse 16 back up
[1:22:37] there thy seed is the dust of the
[1:22:40] earth brother random said you know this
[1:22:42] is kind of an interesting
[1:22:44] thing because he said the thing about
[1:22:47] the Dust of the earth is that it can be
[1:22:49] blown around by every wind of
[1:22:53] Doctrine
[1:22:55] don't build your things on the house on
[1:22:57] sifting Sands of the Sea of
[1:23:00] time but Abraham when he was first
[1:23:03] called was just like the sand of the
[1:23:06] sea he hadn't come to Perfection yet he
[1:23:09] had a lot of years that God had a chisel
[1:23:13] away with him God never mentioned it to
[1:23:16] him
[1:23:19] amen
[1:23:22] amen let's go over here to Genesis
[1:23:26] 15 we'll skip some things
[1:23:29] but so Abraham he went and and God spoke
[1:23:36] to him and because Abraham believed that
[1:23:40] prophecy and confessed it God went to
[1:23:44] work to make it come to pass amen now
[1:23:48] things got bad because got lot got
[1:23:51] hauled away and Abraham had to go go and
[1:23:54] fight for him and bring him back and he
[1:23:57] fought against the 12 Kings and then on
[1:23:59] his way back he met
[1:24:02] MDC who was the Visage he wasn't Jesus
[1:24:06] Christ when he was MDC because Jesus
[1:24:09] Christ wasn't born yet he was born of a
[1:24:14] virgin but he was sworn to be in the
[1:24:18] image after the order after the order of
[1:24:22] MDC yeah wish I had all the time in the
[1:24:25] world but I
[1:24:27] don't so he met
[1:24:29] MDC and then in verse in chapter
[1:24:33] 15 God reiterates again he reminds Abram
[1:24:39] of his promise
[1:24:43] again verse 15 say orif chapter 15 verse
[1:24:47] one says after these things the word of
[1:24:49] the Lord came unto Abram in a vision
[1:24:51] saying fear not Abram I am thy shield
[1:24:53] and thy exceedingly great reward well
[1:24:56] what was he
[1:24:58] before God wanted Abram to fight he
[1:25:03] wanted to see what Abraham would do and
[1:25:07] then God revealed to him later on he
[1:25:09] said Abram he said if you now you can
[1:25:13] confess I am God is my
[1:25:16] shield God is my great reward and I will
[1:25:19] intercede for
[1:25:21] that that battle wasn't place there just
[1:25:24] why wasn't that battle placed after
[1:25:26] chapter
[1:25:28] 15 because God had not revealed it yet
[1:25:31] but he also says so Abram Abram starts
[1:25:36] to argue with the Lord that's why it's
[1:25:39] important to go back and study Abram
[1:25:41] because you and I argue with God all the
[1:25:44] time and we hinder our walk because our
[1:25:48] confession is not
[1:25:50] correct and Abraham said to God he says
[1:25:55] okay I
[1:25:57] know but you know what I'm
[1:25:59] childless and the only person that's
[1:26:02] going to be my Heir is Eliezer of
[1:26:05] Damascus and he says and then God spoke
[1:26:09] back to him because God does not look at
[1:26:12] your
[1:26:14] failures and your
[1:26:17] frustrations because you are the elect
[1:26:20] of God he has a word that he is going to
[1:26:23] fulfill
[1:26:24] and it's not based on you it's based on
[1:26:28] your
[1:26:30] confession
[1:26:34] amen behold of the word of the Lord came
[1:26:37] to him again saying this shall not be
[1:26:39] thine error but he that shall come forth
[1:26:41] out of thine own bowels should be thine
[1:26:43] air and he brought him forth abroad God
[1:26:46] brought Abraham out in maybe on the
[1:26:50] hillside and he said now take a look up
[1:26:54] he said do you see those
[1:26:57] stars do you know what the sons of God
[1:27:00] are
[1:27:03] stars we started out as Sin but we're
[1:27:07] going to be Stars if our confession will
[1:27:11] match
[1:27:14] amen God told Abraham he said first of
[1:27:17] all he says yeah Abraham you're a mess
[1:27:18] you're like the sand of the sea every
[1:27:20] Wind Blows you around you all everywhere
[1:27:23] but there's com in a day when you will
[1:27:26] shine like a star in the firmine amen
[1:27:30] amen amen it's written in there that way
[1:27:34] Amen in Abraham's Covenant confirmed
[1:27:37] brother brandom says so now we notice
[1:27:38] also in Genesis 155 when he confirmed
[1:27:42] the Covenant or spoke to him again about
[1:27:45] it he said go outside look up can you
[1:27:47] Number the Stars how that there's so
[1:27:49] many stars innumerable look from dust to
[1:27:53] Stars oh my from Earth to grave to Glory
[1:27:58] praise the Lord
[1:27:59] amen I didn't make it
[1:28:01] up
[1:28:04] amen
[1:28:07] amen so he says in the wings of a snow
[1:28:10] white dove he says so after these things
[1:28:12] the word of the Lord came unto Abraham
[1:28:14] and a vision so you see Abraham was a
[1:28:15] prophet so he saw Visions fear not
[1:28:18] Abraham I am thy Shield thy exceeding
[1:28:21] reward which is Jehovah Manasses see God
[1:28:25] has to reveal himself to us over under
[1:28:28] every seven Redemptive names I'm not
[1:28:31] going to name them all but God is going
[1:28:34] the reason why some of us we say oh Lord
[1:28:36] you're taking so long Lord I I really
[1:28:39] want to get out here I want to do all
[1:28:40] these things no what you need to be
[1:28:42] doing is saying Lord I want to manifest
[1:28:44] your word whatever part of my life I'm
[1:28:46] at right now I want to manifest God
[1:28:49] whatever he's got for me when I'm
[1:28:50] working then I want to manifest God if I
[1:28:53] was raising kids I want to manifest God
[1:28:55] if I get up in the morning I want to
[1:28:57] manifest God because God is very
[1:29:01] patient he's made a
[1:29:03] covenant amen
[1:29:06] amen D made him a promise you know see
[1:29:10] right then Abraham would have
[1:29:13] failed I like that he says but the
[1:29:16] promise is unconditional the Covenant is
[1:29:20] unconditional brother John read to us
[1:29:22] Romans 8 and he said be when did he
[1:29:26] write your name on the Lamb's Book of
[1:29:28] Life that's what it says in Revelation
[1:29:31] he wrote it from the foundation of the
[1:29:34] world if your name's on the Lamb's Book
[1:29:37] of Life before the foundation of the
[1:29:38] world if you were in the thoughts of God
[1:29:41] before the foundation of the world how
[1:29:44] why are you even saying I'm not going to
[1:29:46] make it Jesus stands back and says well
[1:29:49] I guess there going to be another 6
[1:29:52] months might be a year here till they
[1:29:55] finally get to where they finally say
[1:29:58] yes I'm going to make it I can do all
[1:30:00] things through Christ that strengthe me
[1:30:02] amen I can overcome I can cast down
[1:30:06] reasoning I can cast down my imagination
[1:30:09] I can control this situation I can do
[1:30:13] these things because the word of God
[1:30:15] tells me I can amen amen praise the
[1:30:21] Lord an unconditional PR Pro but you see
[1:30:25] he had to come forth out of his own bows
[1:30:27] and be an heir and he says so he's 100
[1:30:30] years old now and he brought him forth
[1:30:32] abroad and said look up towards the
[1:30:33] heavens amen if you look at he Hebrews
[1:30:37] 11:13 it says they were persuaded of
[1:30:41] them
[1:30:43] convinced they embraced them the
[1:30:47] promises of God and then they
[1:30:51] confessed that's what that
[1:30:54] Hebrews 11:13 that's what it says said
[1:30:57] they persuaded of them they embraced
[1:30:59] them and then they
[1:31:02] confessed now in amongst all of that we
[1:31:05] think oh Abraham he's doing good he's
[1:31:07] doing great he's doing who does anybody
[1:31:10] care about the
[1:31:11] time he's doing great he's doing great
[1:31:15] you know what he does next he goes out
[1:31:17] and creates
[1:31:19] ishma what a
[1:31:21] failure God didn't see him as a failure
[1:31:25] ishmail is not a failure ishmail is the
[1:31:28] Seed of Abraham and because of that God
[1:31:31] has to intercede for
[1:31:33] ishmail oh
[1:31:35] yeah God God blessed ishma out of he
[1:31:40] became the father of many
[1:31:42] nations all the promises that God gave
[1:31:44] Abraham he had to give them
[1:31:46] ishma amen but it didn't stop God from
[1:31:52] keeping Abraham
[1:31:55] promise he revealed himself to him as Al
[1:31:59] shedi and then he changed his name
[1:32:03] because he was getting closer to that
[1:32:06] star he was getting farther away when
[1:32:09] God first found us we were really a mess
[1:32:12] but as we continue to walk with him and
[1:32:15] we continue to confess and positively
[1:32:18] believe the word of God we keep getting
[1:32:20] higher and higher and closer and closer
[1:32:23] to that star
[1:32:24] amen
[1:32:27] amen so when brother brandham said he
[1:32:29] said so he says God finally came
[1:32:33] down and he met Abraham face to face you
[1:32:37] know he had never met him face to face
[1:32:38] till he met him outside the
[1:32:41] tent and he said when he saw the three
[1:32:43] men coming and he started to speak to
[1:32:46] him I want to show you I want to show
[1:32:49] you what brother brandom says
[1:32:52] here he says Abraham I'm going to visit
[1:32:55] you according to my promise the promise
[1:32:57] that he made way back when he first
[1:32:59] called
[1:33:00] him who was it who was it no wonder
[1:33:03] Abraham called him Elohim I'm going to
[1:33:05] make my promise fulfilled and Sarah
[1:33:08] excuse me young ladies Sarah was back in
[1:33:10] the tent a lovely woman but she said me
[1:33:13] an old woman nearly hundred years old
[1:33:16] and my Lord her husband 1002 and have
[1:33:19] pleasure with him again you understand
[1:33:21] what I
[1:33:22] mean husband and wife it had ceased to
[1:33:27] be said have pleasure as a young woman
[1:33:30] again with my husband out there when
[1:33:32] that may have been 20 years passed on
[1:33:34] before a family relationship see me an
[1:33:38] old woman have pleasure with my husband
[1:33:40] and him an old man she
[1:33:43] said
[1:33:45] yeah
[1:33:48] now brother brandom said that when God
[1:33:52] called Abraham he was the elect and that
[1:33:55] was the beginning of the church and that
[1:33:57] angel Elohim In the Flesh looked to
[1:34:00] Abraham and said why did Sarah laugh
[1:34:02] saying within herself that these things
[1:34:04] could not be
[1:34:08] amen so he says so now let me just go a
[1:34:11] little piece further he said she's in
[1:34:13] the tent behind you now look
[1:34:17] god listen
[1:34:19] up God would have condemned the woman
[1:34:23] right there for
[1:34:25] disbelieving that
[1:34:28] angel do you believe
[1:34:31] that but he could not do
[1:34:36] it the same way some of you Pentecostals
[1:34:39] us Pentecostals are acting our
[1:34:42] confession is
[1:34:45] wrong our confession is wrong we say the
[1:34:49] wrong things we believe the wrong things
[1:34:51] we have bad attitudes to any body
[1:34:53] disagrees with this ought to get out of
[1:34:55] the church ought to do this all of that
[1:34:57] our confession is wrong and he cannot
[1:34:59] intercede for us if our confession is
[1:35:06] wrong we'd have been kicked out of the
[1:35:08] church a long time ago but God can't do
[1:35:12] it why if he'd had kicked out if he'd
[1:35:16] have kicked out Sarah she was a part of
[1:35:20] Abraham so she was an heir with him just
[1:35:25] like ishmail was the heir with
[1:35:29] Abraham and God he could not if he
[1:35:33] kicked out her he'd have to kick Abraham
[1:35:36] out too so he couldn't do it on account
[1:35:38] of his wife or on account of the husband
[1:35:42] and that is the
[1:35:44] way it's because Christ can't kick us
[1:35:50] out for having a bad confession
[1:35:55] because we are part of
[1:35:59] him
[1:36:02] amen
[1:36:04] amen he can't throw us away because we
[1:36:09] don't do the right
[1:36:10] things we are his sons and daughters our
[1:36:15] unbelief doesn't mean
[1:36:18] nothing praise the Lord praise the Lord
[1:36:22] amen
[1:36:24] it doesn't mean nothing the real true
[1:36:27] Seed of Abraham will shine anywhere
[1:36:30] anyhow there it was so listen close now
[1:36:34] and the angel said I'm going to visit
[1:36:36] you according that to the time of life
[1:36:39] and this thing will happen the Rapture
[1:36:43] is going to happen we don't know when
[1:36:46] don't really too worried about it I have
[1:36:49] this confidence that he's called me to
[1:36:52] it
[1:36:54] amen so then it's in his hands then what
[1:36:57] I got to do is confess the right thing
[1:37:00] not say oh Lord why is this going wrong
[1:37:03] oh why is this and that and the next
[1:37:05] thing and start believing the word amen
[1:37:09] am man that's the thing I I I wish you
[1:37:12] could I wish you could get the
[1:37:14] revelation of that that when you sing
[1:37:16] the songs of Zion we should be
[1:37:20] rejoicing I mean David danced and jumped
[1:37:23] before the Lord I don't even know what
[1:37:25] you guys would do if I'd run around here
[1:37:26] and dance and jump and praise the Lord
[1:37:29] you know I mean if I
[1:37:31] start yeah most of you go what what is
[1:37:34] he doing you
[1:37:37] see brother Brenham said there he is let
[1:37:40] us consider our high
[1:37:44] priest maybe you know like I say
[1:37:47] sometimes the prayers don't look like
[1:37:49] they're being answered but the scripture
[1:37:51] says that it's based on on the will of
[1:37:54] God not on what our prayers are all he
[1:37:57] you know like brother John told us last
[1:37:59] week he said he said pray here's the
[1:38:02] lord of the
[1:38:04] Harvest the lord of the Harvest has
[1:38:07] spiritualized he can see that the
[1:38:09] Harvest is
[1:38:11] white and he can send laborers he's got
[1:38:15] the power to do that he's got to send
[1:38:17] them but you know what he said he said
[1:38:20] you ask me to send and then I'll send so
[1:38:25] in the meantime I'm not
[1:38:27] sending cuz your confession is wrong
[1:38:32] true and when you start asking me to
[1:38:34] send I
[1:38:37] will that's what the Bible
[1:38:39] says you got to believe it in your heart
[1:38:43] then you got to confess it with your
[1:38:44] mouth and then he'll
[1:38:48] move you ask not you receive not right
[1:38:51] you ask because you pray and you pray to
[1:38:54] consume your own lust you're mad at that
[1:38:56] brother over there oh I wish he'd get
[1:38:59] cancer you know what I mean you pray for
[1:39:02] the wrong things you don't pray to get
[1:39:05] through a battle or through a
[1:39:09] Strife you see your confession is wrong
[1:39:12] and Jesus steps back and just says okay
[1:39:15] it'll just be another six months maybe
[1:39:17] another
[1:39:22] year cuz how many times have we heard we
[1:39:24] come to church all the time here he's
[1:39:25] waiting on
[1:39:27] us well then you you got to find out
[1:39:29] what what the problem is what's the root
[1:39:31] cause I used to do that root cause
[1:39:34] analysis well part of the root cause is
[1:39:37] that our confession is not
[1:39:40] right and Abraham proves
[1:39:44] it Abraham proved it
[1:39:48] amen I love how brother brandom says
[1:39:51] this he he talks about Abraham
[1:39:54] he says in Abraham and his seed after
[1:39:58] him yeah this is my last
[1:40:01] quote I don't May any apologies or
[1:40:04] anything because I want you to get that
[1:40:06] in your head your confession is what's
[1:40:10] hindering your
[1:40:13] walk that is what's doing
[1:40:16] it your prayers they're good the things
[1:40:19] you're doing but if you don't walk in
[1:40:22] faith
[1:40:24] and confess in faith you're not going to
[1:40:26] get
[1:40:28] anywhere and look now we're all waiting
[1:40:30] for a body change right that's what we
[1:40:33] want is a body change brother brandham
[1:40:35] said and Abraham and his seat after him
[1:40:37] he says so look what if he had just
[1:40:40] turned them back to a young man and a
[1:40:41] young woman again like they was at the
[1:40:43] first
[1:40:44] time what if he'd had turned Abraham and
[1:40:46] Sarah right back we all believe he
[1:40:48] turned him back right but he didn't turn
[1:40:51] him just back
[1:40:54] it didn't just turn him back because
[1:40:57] brother brandham said if he turned him
[1:40:58] back they' have still been
[1:41:02] childless he healed
[1:41:05] him he turned him back and turned him
[1:41:08] into the
[1:41:09] Stars turned them back into their
[1:41:12] glorified
[1:41:13] bodies because then she brought forth
[1:41:17] children he had lived with her since she
[1:41:19] was in teenage that's what the prophet
[1:41:22] said he says they couldn't had the baby
[1:41:24] anyhow because they'd lived together
[1:41:26] when they was young man and woman he had
[1:41:28] to change their body in a different way
[1:41:31] in order to receive to get the sun is
[1:41:34] that right their body had to be changed
[1:41:36] in another way to receive the Sun and we
[1:41:41] cannot if we go back to being young men
[1:41:44] and women we still cannot meet the Son
[1:41:48] of
[1:41:51] God I don't want to go
[1:41:54] back and be this body is
[1:41:59] corruption this body is hybrid this body
[1:42:03] the devil has a right to it i' go into
[1:42:05] the science and show you all of the
[1:42:08] but he is going
[1:42:11] to push all the corruption away the
[1:42:15] corruption will go away and this that is
[1:42:19] corruptible will take on
[1:42:22] incorruption when he changes me
[1:42:25] back and when he changes me back I can
[1:42:28] walk right through that
[1:42:30] wall I can think and be
[1:42:36] there if we would go back to being young
[1:42:39] men and women we still can't meet the
[1:42:41] sun because we're going to meet him in
[1:42:43] the air we got to have a changed body to
[1:42:46] meet him in the air the Rapture so
[1:42:49] that's the next thing for the children
