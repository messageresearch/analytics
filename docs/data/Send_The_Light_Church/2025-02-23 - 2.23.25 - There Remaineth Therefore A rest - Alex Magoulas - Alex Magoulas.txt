into the body Praise You Jesus amen this is not a political rally this is the body of Jesus Christ I feel I lost my voice in that worship service but if you're going to Lo if you're going to hurt yourself you might as well do it for Jesus amen amen well God bless each and every one of you so glad it's so good to see a number that haven't been here in a while and um I say you came to the right place um I believe that you're you're really not going to hear from a man today you're going to hear from God but God has to use a man to speak to us and that's the way he chose I mean he can speak to our heart but he chose the Bible says the foolishness of preaching and if we could just get everything out of the way except God is right here speaking to to this morning and that we take it home with us it's not really what we can learn today it's not like sitting in a front of a television learning it's what we can receive into our heart and take that home and apply it in our personal lives that's what will make us grow in Christ and um we just love brother Alex love his ministry we love him here we love his family God bless his family amen and thank you for your sacrifice it's much easier to not drive long distances and go to different places and and so God bless and reward you as well amen is our prayer we're going to have our brother come as let's sing only believe as our brother comes to give us the wonderful Words of Life today only believe only believe all things are possible ho believe all things are possible only Lord I believe oh Lord I believe Lord I believe all things are possible Lord I believe Lord I believe Lord I believe all things are possible Lord I believe amen we're so thankful for that today we are saved by grace through faith and that's not even of ourselves it's the gift of God so we believe today because he gave us something to believe Amen in an age where there's all kinds of people with influences and things and they can give you ideas about things that you should believe in that we have something steadfast and sure so I just have you be seated for just a moment um you know I was thinking about it this feels a little strange and I'm like why does this feel so strange and it dawned on me this is my first time speaking in the US since I got back from Egypt so I'm like oh yeah it's there's there's carpet and things on the floor that's why it's nice so I just thought I'd take a few moments that's all right and just uh appreciate I know that prayers were made for me and stuff in Egypt um I went with brother Jason Demars got back just a little over just a little under two weeks ago now so I know he made a full report at his church it's online if people want to see it but I'll just say a couple things in passing real quick we had a real blessed time um I got to the airport in Egypt we landed about 5 minutes before I got off the plane I set my phone down to fill out the Customs card and I left my plane on the phone so I was told I was told you know good luck with that getting that back because you know somebody will find it but they won't turn it in so I prayed about and said well Lord if you want me to be here just uh you just give me my phone back and I got back the next night I went to the airport they found it and gave it back so that's uh that's already impressive with it's impressive with Airlines it's really impressive in a place like Egypt I guess so but I was really grateful for that um I think brother Jason said he's been working there with brother there's a brother there by the name of Mall in Cairo he's got a message church as far as I know it's the only Message Church in Egypt so he's been working with him for about four years and um I'll just real briefly say this with the with the culture and the different things there it's very difficult to find a lot of open doors to preach and to work but uh we met a another Pastor there it's actually a group of Pentecostal churches I think it's about 60 of them and they recently broke off of the denomination they were from because they differed with their uh denominations Doctrine about evidence of the Holy Ghost being speaking in tongues so they're already kind of they kind of broke off from that a little bit we went and we we ministered particularly on the idea of water baptism in Jesus Christ's name was one of the things we talked about we had prayer for the sick and we have different testimonies different people were healed as well and uh the biggest thing that was a real blessing to us is we preach at a different church every night we were there and the last night that we were preaching in the area that we went to that Pastor that we had visited he kind of introduced us to the different churches he said uh he said I received this message that you guys are preach about water baptism in Jesus name so he wants brother Jason or whoever wants somebody to come back and he wants to get re-baptized wants this whole church to get re-baptized and he wants to hear more about the message so it's just a real big breakthrough I appreciate your prayers I believe God's looking to do something amen he said he'd have a king uh people out of every Kindred and tongue and nation and so I believe there's people in Egypt that are there and they're the Lord's children so just appreciate your prayers and like I said we have many different testimonies there was a few different things in particular people we had prayer for with uh there was one woman had uh it was kind of funny we were doing a prayer line one night and she was kind of just kind of helping people come up and stuff and I stopped I said well sister what are you here for she's like oh I'm just helping people I said what do you have going on she had osteoporosis or something her knees been back D for years and so we we had prayer for her and she started danc around her knees got healed right there in the service so just different things like that God is God is the same amen now listen he's not just the god of Egypt amen he's he's our God today amen he's greater than the gods of Egypt he's greater than anything else so he's greater than sickness and so I appreciate your prayers because our God answers prayers I believe he's got a purpose in I believe if the Lord would carry there's a work in Egypt and I'm just I was just uh I was happy just to be a witness of it so thank you so much for that I appreciate that God orchestrates things a certain way yes you know we can we can rest when we understand that God has a plan and he orchestr orchestrates things a certain way if we'll let him do it the way he wants you know brother Bruce was just singing this morning about leaning on the Everlasting Arms and take your burden to the Lord leave it there and I appreciate that because I didn't tell him to sing those songs but somebody did am amen I believe it ties into what we're looking at today and uh I just want to talk about that this idea resting because brother Brandon makes a statement he says the entire Christian experience is based upon rest so I want us to really take that to heart today and would you just stand with me for a moment once more let's let's have a word of prayer because I think our P the pastor here said it right you know you don't want to hear from me and I have nothing to give you anyway but we're going to trust that according to God's plan he wants to speak we're going to trust him to speak to us let's just pray father we we thank you today you you are a God that answers prayer but more than that Lord You're the god that knows what we need not just what we want Lord there's many times we desired things in our lives and we prayed for them and you gave us something better than what we prayed for you knew better Lord you've been a gentle Shepherd to us and you've helped us along life's way and Lord the troubles that we deal with and the struggles we face so often Lord we find it's the situations that we have created for ourselves when our hearts were drawn astray and we went Wayward from you but today Lord as we've gathered here in this place no matter what the struggle is or the cause we know that you are faithful you're are a everpresent help in the time of need and you are a refuge to your people and so we come here today in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and we ask for you to come and to speak not just what we want to hear Lord we we have a whole world full of people that'll tell us what we want to hear but tell us that which we need to hear that which is needful for our overcoming for the edification of your people may you come and speak Words of Life the words that would glorify you and give praise and honor and glory to you may you come and do the things which only you can do father may you cause a rest for the people may it be a satisfying portion to them and father we commit these things into your hands we thank you now for it all ask you bless the reading of the word and the ministering thereof in Jesus Christ's name amen if you turn with me this morning in your bibles if you have it the book of Hebrews the fourth chapter and uh this book of Hebrews it's a book of contrast it contrasts the law and the figures in the law with Jesus Christ in the New Testament and at the end of the third chapter he's talking about the provocation where the children of Israel they tempted God in the wilderness they refused to listen to God and I think it's a really good lesson for us because you know God by his grace he brought them out of Egypt he sent them a prophet he fed them by grace and then they said well we want to do something something we want a law we want to we want to have so they got a law and like a day later they broke it I mean just immediately human instrumentality and human effort it provoked God it frustrated God and it was no end of trouble for them themselves and so Paul makes this conclusion here in Hebrews chapter 4 speaking about this he says let us therefore fear lest a promise being left of us of entering into his rest any of you should seem to come short of it so we've been promised rest let's be let's be concerned now that we don't come short of what he's promising is what he's saying for unto us was the Gospel preached as well as unto them but the word preached did not profit them now they heard the same gospel but it didn't help them why not being mixed with faith in them that heard it for we which have believed do enter into rest so we've got it amen if you believe a excuse me we do enter into rest as he said as I have sworn in my wrath if they shall enter into my rest although the works were finished from the foundation of the world so he's speaking about different rests here and just to unpack this a little bit there there was a rest that God had at the beginning of creation and then he swore to them they won't enter into rest so there was another rest to come is what he's saying it's a different kind of rest so he's he's showing you it's a different kind of rest for he spake in a certain place on the seventh day on this wise and God did rest the seventh day from all his works and in this place again so this is a different rest if they shall enter into my rest seeing therefore it remaineth that some must enter in so other words there somebody has to enter into this rest and they to whom it was first preached entered not because of unbelief so there's a rest that's remaining somewhere and these people didn't get it amen it's not the rest that God had in the beginning verse 7even again he limith a certain day saying in David today after so long a time as it is said today if you will hear his voice Harden not your hearts for if Jesus now this talking about Joshua it's the same name in the Old Testament for Joshua talking about the Exodus had given them rest then would he not afterward have spoken of another day so this is the conclusion there was a rest at the beginning there was a rest coming to the promised land but God said that they won't enter into the rest that I prepared so therefore verse n there remaineth therefore in conclusion there remaineth therefore a rest to the people of God for he that has entered into his rest he also has ceased from his own works as God did from his let us labor now this is this seems paradoxical here let us labor therefore to enter into that rest lest any man fall after the same example of unbelief I just want to read a couple more verses here notice for the word of God is quick and powerful and sharper than any two-edged sword piercing even to the dividing a su of Soul and Spirit of the joints and Marrow and is a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart neither is there any creature that is not manifest in his sight but all things are naked and open unto the eyes of him with whom we have to do so these last two verses are warning us listen God knows whether you're arrested or not amen there's no point in trying to fool God and there's really no point in trying to fool yourselves that's what most people do well I'm okay I'm where I need to be I'm fine but they're not fine and we see this in the scripture so we have a warning today to make sure we've entered into this rest and so I just may the Lord bless the reading it was word you may be seated this morning here so as we just talked about a moment ago when we look in the original account of Creation The Book of Genesis we find as it mentions here in Hebrews that God rested on the seventh day from all his works and he blessed the day he the scripture says he blessed it thank you so much he bless this seventh day this this day of rest and so I want you to consider this I don't believe that God rested because he was weary or because he was tired he's like man that was really tough I need to take a break but God doesn't rest because he's tired or weary but he Caps or completes his work by rest so rest shows that the work is finished amen it's a it's a signification that he's satisfied with his work amen so so to the Christian as God has done by the work of the new creation us he causes us to enter into a completeness in rest amen so when we're resting in the Lord we're putting confidence in a finished work amen now God is doing things in our lives but the work that's necessary for us to be saved that's already done amen he cried out when he died at the cross it is finished amen and so everything that we need today everything that we're looking for that we're depending upon we're resting on the idea or the not just an idea but the it's a finished work amen so God rested and Jesus he's uh he's called the lord of the the Sabbath in the gospels how many knows this amen he's the lord of the Sabbath and he makes it very clear because the Jews accuse him of violating the Sabbath because one day he sees a woman sick and it's the Sabbath day and he heals this woman they said ah look at this he broke the Sabbath God ordained this rest and here he is violating it but he says listen if you had an ox in a ditch on the Sabbath day you'd go fetch it out and this is a daughter of Abraham in other words she's worth more than the ox if it was an ox you'd care about the ox but she's been sick for days maybe for years and you get all up in arms because well you're violating this rest and what's ironic he's the lord of the Sabbath they're upset because he's violating the Sabbath and they accuse him of breaking the law they accuse him of violating the Sabbath and he makes this point listen men was not made for the Sabbath the Sabbath was made for the man amen God didn't make a bunch of men and make children so he could make his words and his law ah see people I got somebody to observe it amen he didn't make all these things because he wanted to promote the observance he made the observance for you amen he didn't make you so you could glorify the idea of rest he made rest so you would have it to glorify him amen and this is what religion does we always promote the form or the fashion or the the the doctrine of it over what the the purpose was amen Jesus he suffered and died and he rose again not for a bunch of words on a page not just for a Creed Dogma but for people for his children he did it for us and he gives his word he sent his word and he healed us and he delivered us from our own destructions we were the ones that were bound we were the ones that fell but he sent himself he came and redeemed man and so men they took the Sabbath just like they did in the law and they they made it about uh trying to to fulfill their purpose or their law well we're we're Pharisees we're not Sadducees our denomination and our teach and our our church and our teachings and this and they made it about what they wanted it to be not what the purpose of God was behind it amen so listen I hope you caught that God made the Sabbath for you amen we we're looking for a Rapture well listen he didn't make a bunch of people to stick him in a Rapture he so he could have a Rapture he made a Rapture for you he made a rap Rapture for me he made a resurrection for us amen it was purpose for his children amen there's a future home for you the listen the home is not a home because it's got gold streets or Mansions or big fields it's the people that live there it's without the people it's just a house you're what makes it a future home the character of God's children is what makes you the place he wants to live amen so he didn't make all these things and as an afterthought hey I'll put some children in to Adorn these things amen you were the thought you were the one in his mind his people his children you were the thing you were the focus amen and he made all these things every Mountain he ever made every every ocean all the things he's ever made he made it because he wanted a place to dwell with his people amen so you are the the motivation amen you're the motivation behind all the things that he said and did amen so they debate with him on the Sabbath and they missed the whole point amen listen the Sabbath is supposed to be ARR and here's this daughter of Abraham listen she's a child of God and you'll take care of the ox but not her there's something wrong with your thinking exactly that's not how God feels about it amen he made this rest to help her and you want to leave her where she's at well that's religion amen amen well we'll tell you how we want you to live and we'll tell you how we want you to be but we want we don't care about where you're at amen see they weren't looking at where she was at they were just looking at their law or their idea amen you know years ago the first time I ever went on a mission trip I went to Uganda I don't know if I've ever told this story or not this is clear back in uh 2011 boy I feel old all of a sudden amen clear back in 2011 I was in Uganda and you know it's funny I was going to preach at church it was a brush Arbor and uh we had to stop midday because the place wasn't ready and we just sitting in this guy's house and uh I look out in the street and there's there's this man out there in Uganda he's sweeping the street which is really remarkable to me because the street is made of dirt amen so he's just sweeping this dirt road I don't know moving some of the trash from one spot to another because they just throw the trash everywhere so he's moving this trash around here and I'm I'm wearing a suit and a tie and stuff in the middle of the day in in Uganda it's like at the equator I'm over there in May I stood out like a sore thumb I'm white I'm sweat I'm wearing a suit so this guy I happen to see him and he he walks up to me and it's kind of funny he starts to discussion with me about religion he's like well you must be a preacher I said what gave it away you know here I'm pack I probably have my Bible and everything you know how it is but but uh he starts talking to me and he says well I want to ask you a question he says what day do you worship God on I said that's easy all of them no no that's not what I meant he said what day do you do you go to church and things I said well we we typically go to church on Sunday he's like well you know the Sabbath is actually on Saturday and I said well actually it's Friday evening the Saturday afternoon if you want to get real he Seventh Day Adventist is what he is and so they they they focus they they they go to seed on and say do you have to come together and worship God on Saturday which really according to the Orthodox Jewish religion it would actually be Friday evening to Saturday afternoon because evening and day is a day but anyway that's where they're at and so he he wanted to contend with me over this idea of what day I go to church because that's a big deal to him amen and like I said I thought my answer is good well I worship him every day I just happen to get together on certain days all is amen and so he goes on and on with me for a while and finally he's talking about how well you you know it's it's the law and you have to keep the law to be righteous and I said well that's interesting because Abraham was found righteous because he believed God Abraham believed God and it was imputed unto him for righteousness and I said that was 400 years before Moses came gave the commandment and now this is I'm not trying to make fun of the guy but this is what he said he said No No Moses was born before Abraham and I and now if you read the Bible you know that's not true you know Abraham was Moses's great great great great whatever grandfather so I looked at him I said sir I figured out what the problem is here you just don't know what the Bible says and this crowd had started gathered in the v like like 20 people standing around us and I said that now I'm not trying to sign whatever but he can't really blush but like he got real embarrassed and so he's like well I'll have to talk to you about this later I don't know how he was going to do this if I was going to come back to but the but my point is he he wanted to argue with me on this point because he was taught this by his church you must Worship On this day you have to do this and they've made that their their preeminent thing amen and you see how religion will take even a thing that God took for rest and it'll turn it into works even the things that God ordained to be ar rest for us religion and the devil will make it works for you amen people look at this message they look at the Bible and say well that's just a bunch of dos and don'ts and it's a bunch of work man this Bible has made my life so much better obedience to the word of God it's not a burden to me that's what the priest did in the Book of Malachi oh it's such a chore it's such a it's such a burden to serve God that's because you're doing it wrong it wasn't meant to be a burden you made it one Jesus said my yoke is easy and my burden is light and I submit to you today if you find it's too heavy maybe it's because you're packing it around the wrong way well praise the Lord and I'm getting Ahad of myself every little bit but that's the truth amen it's like you take you know when your kids are little or you take somebody at work maybe it's their first time and they're picking something up and you know you're an adult you could do it but you're watching them and you watch them struggle to do something it's like listen you're doing that the wrong way there's a lot easier way to do that if you just listen to me I'm not saying this to be your boss I'm not saying this sounds smarter than you there's just a lot better way to do it God's like listen I'm not trying to be mean there's just a better way to do it than you're doing it amen we carry around burdens we carry around besetting sins we struggle we restle and then we wonder why we're tired all the time it's because you're packing it around the wrong way you're carrying things you weren't meant to carry amen amen you're not yolked to the you're yolked to your burdens you're yolked to your besetting sins y woke up with Jesus amen cuz he already bore it at Calvary well praise the Lord so here's Joshua he tells the children of Israel Moses give us a place he give us this Promised Land we're going to go in here we're going to take this land and because of their unbelief under Moses they didn't enter in and they finally get there with Joshua and they enter in but yet there's we know that wasn't the rest that God is speaking about because David is as Paul points out David hundreds of years later is speaking about rest that is still to come so whatever they had in the promised land when they finally came in that's not the rest that God was looking at the ultimate thing he's looking at because he's prophesying of something greater and we see this in Isaiah chap 28: 11 and 12 12 the Bible says this for with stammering lips and another tongue will I speak unto this people saying this is the rest wherein I will cause my people to rest this is the refreshing and yet they would not hear it now we understand this as a prophetic scripture and it speaks about the day of Pentecost and the holy ghost coming on the day of Pentecost but I want you to understand it's also prophetic in the Old Testament because what happened is the the leaders of Ephraim they made Leagues with the Assyrians and the leaders of Judah they made Leagues with the Egyptians they're making treaties in other words you've got these God this God ordained nation and they've split up over religion and now that they've split up over religion they're making treaties for their protection with the Nations around them that God said he hated them so what does it speaking about it's speaking about the idea that God does not respect us trusting in our own strength trusting in the strength of the world he said I'm I've given you a word I'm going to send you something but because you won't receive it that's why it's not a rest for you and he did the same thing on the day of Pentecost amen they come and they're speaking with other tongues and these people hear it in their own language God is sending them a rest because that's what the Holy Ghost is that's our rest amen but the people the leaders who was it that took Peter and John who was it that rejected the gospel in Jerusalem it's the leaders they said we don't want this we've got our own thing we've got our own program oh my it's a warning to us when we trust in our own Merit when we try to run to the world for our solution now and and I want to be careful about that listen I'm not saying today not to go to talk to somebody or get help from a doctor but you can't your confidence is not there your confidence is in God Amen and anytime we put our confidence in a man or the things of the world or ourselves listen I'm talking about us ourselves well I've got an idea right I've got a plan right brother John you you get this probably not just you but you get this listen somebody comes to you and they're like ah man we're dealing with this certain situation and we we're just we're not sure what we should do I've got this idea I think I should do this and you sit there and say well you know brother or sister the scripture says this this is what the Bible says about your situation it's like well I know it says that but okay as soon as they're like well yeah but I don't know why you came to me I don't know why you're asking you're clearly not concerned about what God thinks about it you were just hoping that God shared your opinion I love it well you know we'll go pray about it what's there to pray about God give you an answer don't make prayer a refuge for your unbelief cuz you don't want to obey well I'm I'm praise the Lord somebody I'm talking to somebody now how many times Well Lord what am I supposed to do here and he sitting there going I done told you what to do you just don't want to listen and now you're struggling and now you're fussen and not why can't I overcome cuz you didn't listen oh now I'm really off the rails amen I gotta find a way to bring this back amen we why why why am I struggling cuz you're not listening cuz you're doing it wrong amen because you're trusting in yourself because you're trusting in manmade ability and that will always fail the bed is shorter than a man can lay on it the Blanket's shorter than a man can stretch you can't do it it won't work you can't make it something it's not we realize according to Galatians the thirr chapter that The Blessing of Abraham this is the thing Abraham was he he was he was prophesied that in you all nations will be blessed what is The Blessing of Abraham the holy ghost coming back on the day of Pentecost the Holy Ghost returning upon the Believers amen because why does the Holy Ghost come the book of 1 Corinthians the 2 chapter tells you why that you would know the things which are freely given unto you in other words you've got what you need if you listen if you'll pay attention if you'll take it and receive it and act on it and Obey it you have what you need that's why he gives the Holy Ghost so you would not be ignorant so you would know so if you're ignorant it's because you're not listening it's because you're not paying attention if you've got the Holy Ghost listen the John says this way you have an unction and you know all things I people call me a note all for years the Bible says I am but I don't know here you don't know it here it's it's here and when you're not listening amen praise the Lord now I haven't looked at this a whole lot but it's like they want to get these AI chips and put them in your head and you can you can Google anything now amen well listen God's been doing that for 2,000 years you need to know something there's an unction in you if you'll listen if you'll take his counsel if you'll consult the word it's there praise the Lord they that are LED of the spirit they're the sons of God there there is leadership for the church today Hallelujah there is leadership for the sons of God today and the daughters of God today if they'll listen listen the problem in the Old Testament the problem in the New Testament was never a lack of God speaking it was never oh I should have sent a prophet I should have sent the word no he said listen morning by morning I spoke to you I sent you prophets I sent the word the problem is never God not speaking the problem is us not listening so we struggle we worry we wear ourselves out we run from our trouble and we find that we tire out a long time before our troubles through we get tired then finally if we're if we're lucky if we're blessed finally we say Lord I just I can't handle this and he's sitting there I know I tried to tell you that months ago am I tried tell you that years ago you didn't listen I know you can't handle it that's why I had to handle it if you could handle it you wouldn't have needed me the Holy Ghost comes and what happens according to the book of Ephesians the first chapter you're sealed what's that mean you're sealed you're not sealed to the next church service you're not sealed to the next sensation or the next election or the next Revival you're sealed under the day of redemption because the Holy Ghost is a seal that your faith has been accepted you know what that means the box car is shut you're not putting anything in there and nothing's getting out you might as well sit down and enjoy the ride cuz you're locked in baby that's my Homer longor baby you're sealed to the destination amen Abraham believed God it was impeded him for righteousness and then afterwards the Covenant of circumcision comes amen so so see you don't do a certain thing per se but you believed and because you believe after you believe you're sealed what the Holy Spirit have promised amen it's God that works in you amen both to Will and to do his good pleasure amen see you say well I don't have I don't I don't have this whatever it's in you if you'll submit to it it's a promise it's not a reward amen see this is the problem we we try to make it a reward and then we get frustrated we don't get a reward it's not supposed to a reward is I did this so God owes me that guess what God don't owe you and I anything and he's never going to owe us anything and when we act like he's going to owe us something what we've actually done what we've actually done is we've insulted or we've Paul would say this way in Galatians do we frustrate the grace of God you imagine God's like hey I did this thing for here you go well I'm going to do it well I already did it not only can you not do it better than me you can't do it at all you can't save yourself imagine as a now we got some parents here amen well I did this certain thing with my kids like well I'm it's frustrating like listen you no hopefully you don't do that that's terrible but it's FR it frustrates the grace of God if righteousness came by the law then Jesus died in vain amen listen if there is any way for you and I to change our station by oursel any way at all even for one person then Jesus died in vain true amen so it cannot be a reward now there are rewards in the Bible I'm talking about salvation I'm talking about Redemption amen Redemptive work cannot be a reward it is only a promise to us amen notice the Bible because I said this a moment ago it's it's God in you now he wills and he does his work in you amen it wasn't even your willingness it's you submitted it to him that's why the scripture says that if you've entered into this rest you've ceased from your own works it didn't say you ceased from Works catch that now you've just ceased from your own works it's not you amen it's like Paul Paul speaks about this he talks about the the other Apostles and their labors in the gospel he said I labored more abundantly than them all amen but yet not me it wasn't me the man it was the grace of God upon me the grace of God made him who he was the grace of God empowered him to do this amen you know uh let me say it this way you you've not ceased from works you ceased from your own works that's where we struggle our works stop doing what you want amen you know I've said this for years I always tell people you know what let God use you you should let God use you that to let means to allow amen there's a difference between letting God using you and telling God to use you amen I've seen this amen well God I want you to use me in this ministry God I want you to use me in this this God so the problem is now you're telling God how he has to use you and then when he doesn't use you that way or he uses somebody else that way now we get frustrated well God why do and it causes jealousy it causes confusion it causes frustration it's it's a whole another thing God use me however you want amen Lord I will allow myself to be an instrument of your righteousness in whatever way if you want to do this if you want it's up to God because as soon as we start telling God how we want him to do it amen now that's our works yes and we can come back and say look what I've done for the Lord I did this and I did that and I'm not like so and so I don't do this and I do do that I'm better than them I'm glad I'm not like him oh it's all about your works now so we either stumble and fall into sin by besetting sin we get puffed up in our fleshly minds and we think we're more than we really are and either way you're in trouble you've ceased from your own works it's his work we're not saved by our works but we are his workmanship created unto good works the Bible says in Ephesians 2 amen it's Christ in you that's why it's resting notice it's not sleeping that's what some people do they sleep it's not sleeping as the world sleeps but it's resting in other words rest is an Act of Faith it's so counterintuitive to our our human thinking that's the point amen our human thinking says well if it works seven days a week I'll get more done if it works six days a week but God says no if you'll trust me with that seventh day I'll accomplish more in your life then you could do in a whole lifetime of your own work look it takes a conscious effort for us to take our hands off of something yes that's that's counterintuitive to our thinking listen I need to do this if I don't do this it won't get done so that's a problem you're doing itach it I think it was Martin Luther he got up and he would pray for an hour in the day at the beginning of the day and if he had a lot of some some guy came to one time because he he said he had he had so much to do to this day said I have to pray even more and the guy was confused says well if you have so much more to do why you why are you taking more time to pray he said that's why amen amen listen if I if I trust it to God it'll get done right the first time you ever sit there well glory to God this is preached about anybody in here you ever sit there and you wrestle with something you beat your head against the wall and you worry and you struggle man this is not working out and you get done and you finally give up and you pray about it and then it works out fine five minutes later and you sit there and you think to yourself man why didn't I pray about that in the first place and then we go right out the door and do the same thing all over again we should have learned our lesson praise the Lord I don't I don't think Einstein actually said this but they commonly attribute this idea that if you do the same thing over and over again expecting a different result it's Insanity anden we forget that we just got done praying about that thing that worried us for months and we got an answer to prayer we walk out well glory to God see we're not resting we're not trusting to God's hands but I got to get more done stop trying to get it done let God do what he wants to do Oh Glory listen the Jews they asked Jesus in they asked him in the gospels because they seen him doing all these Mighty Works what must we do to do the works of God we want to do all these Works what must we do Jesus said here's the work not works it's just one here's the work that you believe on him who the father has sent if you just believe God will take care of the rest if you just submit and obey God is able to furnish what you need amen amen so we have to labor a struggle you have to struggle to rest yeah now the older you get you kind of understand a little bit man this BET's not you know it's not it's not a you have to get yourself in a position where you're not struggling amen amen see we're struggling and then we get tired because we're not resting amen praise the Lord you have to believe now see this is the thing believe this my English lesson for the day talking to my daughter about this she's writing a letter believe is a verb it's an action word it's something you do faith is a noun it's a subject you can have faith but if you don't mix the faith if you don't mix it in with what you're hearing you're not believing it's not doing you any good amen your faith without works is dead it's not saying you have to do Works to be saved he's saying save people act out what they believe Hallelujah David said I believe therefore I've spoke and Paul said we also believe that's why we speak my works are not saving me my Works come out of a life that has been redeemed Hallelujah in other words if you're believing for something you Orient your work words and your actions around that you act in a way that that is congruent or that lines up with what you're believing amen so listen if you're sick you say I believe I'm well you act well amen praise God he's healing it's not a lie it's not a lie it's notop faking it till you make it oh praise the Lord I hear this a lot well you got to fake it till you make it I don't believe in faking it till you make it God doesn't fake it what I do believe this is what I do believe though Abraham called things that were not as though they were and then they were that's not the same because he had a basis for saying it faith is the substance of things hoped for it's the evidence of Things Not Seen because he had Faith from a God that cannot lie he acted in a certain way when he knew he was going to have a child he's had he had Sarah start making booties and get a crib and get the get the plans together we're going to have a child thank you Lord I heard this years ago I was I talking about my first mission trip here a few minutes ago first time I was getting ready to go somewhere I remember I was praying about it I was sitting in a church one day and this guy was talking about if you have faith you act on it he said if you were if God had told you you were going to preach in different places around the world he said I first thing I do is go buy a passport I thought I didn't buy a passport no wonder I'm sitting here so I went bought a passport i' gone a month later you act in a way that lines up with what you're confessing and if you trusted God with a certain thing then you're resting because you're letting him do it yes listen as soon as you start to take a hold of it as soon as you start to do your own thing you've you've acted outside of a manner that believes amen so for the believer there they've entered into rest in other words you're no longer concerned about the outcome amen because the outcome is settled all the other stuff might go one way or the other but the outcome is settled amen you as a Believer if you're sealed by the Holy Ghost your destination that was predetermined it's settled now you might go through some things on the way true I can guarantee you you're going to go through some things on the way there's probably things you'll go through on the way that you didn't plan for and you're sitting there going well if I had known that's why God didn't tell you maybe but he did tell you what the destination is and no matter what you're going through this part is secure praise God it's settled you don't have to worry about that if God's given you the witness of it amen the Bible says in Hebrews 10 he's quoting the the Old Testament Paul says this is the Covenant that I will make with them after those days sayith the Lord I will put my law into their hearts and their minds will I write them now notice he puts the law in your heart he places it there but he's going to write it into your mind that's why Romans uh the 12th chapter says you have to be renewed amen because this thing didn't get redeemed overnight that's right this thing wants to the carnal mind enmity with God right so you know what you have to do you need to renew the Mind amen stop thinking about the way you think about it amen think about the way God says it amen your thinking must line up with the word of God that's the only way your actions will line up with the word of God amen amen so he's going to write it in your mind and I love this he says you're and there sins and iniquities will I remember no more well praise the Lord I tell you what if if you don't don't got any other good news today that's some pretty good news listen if I put my law in your heart if put my spirit in there your sins and your iniquities I will remember them no more you might remember them every day your life you might struggle with it you might you might contend with it it might cause you to lose sleep but in the mind of God I don't remember anymore he forgot it you'll go back to God 10 years from now oh Lord please forgive me this thing that I asked forgiveness for before and he'll say I don't know what you're talking about I forgot it I don't remember it I'm not struggling with it so you see God's not concerned about your destination it's settled now Paul takes this and he draws a conclusion from this amen he draws a conclusion from this the next verse now where remission of these is there is no more offering for sin like what do you mean in other words he's not keeping a record of your faults listen if you under if you are in Covenant with God if you're sealed by the baptism of the Holy Ghost you've been Sanctified through the blood of Jesus Christ then he's no longer keeping a record of your faults amen he doesn't get a new record and start over and have to fix it every time amen he he no longer imputes it to you amen that's why David says blessed is the man think about now I didn't put this in my notes so I'm doing this top of my head here but think about David David he commits the probably one of the worst sins his life with Bas Sheba he he's going to lose this child he's done all this stuff and when he gets caught the Prophet The Prophet Nathan comes to him and calls him out for his sin his adultery and having this man murdered he he knows he deserves to die he spoke it by his own mouth right listen I deserve to die for this but what does the prophet Nathan say God has already oh my even when he didn't want to admit it and then he gets caught he's like I deserve to die for this I was wrong God has already caused this sin to pass think about in in the worst situation of his life he gets a revelation God never even imputed it to me I'll I'll reap the consequences of my actions I'm gonna I'm G to have trouble in my house but as far as the sin issues concerned it's already it didn't even come to David oh help me out somebody listen it's no longer even imputed to you that's why Paul makes his point if there's remission there's no more offering that's not that's not this idea that you can't be saved the idea is there's no offering for you anymore because there's no sin to make an offering by one sacrifice he has already perfected you forever you say where you going with this the grace of God is so great listen because I I dealt with this when I first come to the Lord I knew this guy you know if you do this thing wrong you know you you have a wrong thought you're driving down the road you have this wrong thought all you get in a car you die now you're going to go to hell because that thing was unconfessed in your life man they don't even come near you as a Believer you see what I'm saying it's not I got to hurry if you have to make it right oh praise the Lord I'm trying to think this is this is such a great thing I hope you catch this amen it's not oh I sinned today so I need to hurry up and go get forgiveness and give an offering and get on the blood again before before I I'm I die in sin that's not what's up you're already forgiven right if you're in Christ you're saying brother are you saying we shouldn't ask God for forgiveness no what I'm saying is you shouldn't ask God for forgiveness for righteousness sake say what do you mean by that listen you didn't become unrighteous and need to fix that you say you're sorry it's like your kids you say you're sorry because you're sorry if you have to tell your kids to say sorry and they get to a certain age it doesn't really have the same meaning anymore it's like listen I I ask God to forgive me because I want the right kind of fellowship with God Amen I'm not asking him to forgive me for my sins because I don't have any anymore I oh say brother brother you're going to encourage sin in the church by doing this well that's funny because you know what it did it did the opposite with David when David realized his sins were remitted he blessed the Lord and build him a house he didn't go out and say well I guess I'll go get another I'll go steal another man's wife and I'll do this it it caused the opposite the grace of God Drew up the goodness of God led him to repentance and we're say Don't Preach Grace that way you'll enable people to sin listen if they want to sin they're going to find a way to do it anyway amen what I'm telling you is there's liberty for the believer I'm not worried about my position with God if I'm in Christ it's settled amen you make a mistake you have a mishap that doesn't change your relationship with God anymore it's settled amen so yeah I think mistakes we all make mistakes what I'm telling you is it's not imputed to me is sin because I have an advocate amen there's no offering for it well God otherwise he'd have to go slay Christ again it's should like the Old Testament you have to go get a new offering every time no it was settled that day at Calvary amen everything everything listen every sin you ever committed was after he died amen that was already settled before you were born amen so he can't go so it's not like future sins are going to change that because all your sins were future sins from the day of Calvary so it's not like you just knew about the ones that you knew about praise the Lord now your your enemy he's an accuser the accuser of the Brethren and that's his job amen he'll go and say well you did this and you did that that and you did this and you did that you know what you do you look him say I didn't do anything I've ceased from my own Works listen I know I hope this is okay listen Paul says the same thing in Romans 7 he says when I want to do good evils present the things I would do I don't the things I don't want to do I do he said therefore there's a law in my members the law of my mind wants to serve God hopefully that's is that is that us today hopefully that's where you're at but the law sin and death is in my members and it struggles against it therefore if I sin it's no longer me oh my is Paul justifying himself no God Justified him it's no longer me it's sin in my members in other words can I can I let me spell this out that's not the real me I'm not getting rid of your accountability what I'm saying is but that's not who you are you're not the hypocrite when you're in church repent for what you did you're the hypocrite when you did the thing amen you're not you're not a wicked person trying to get right you're a righteous person the devil's trying to make Wicked amen listen your righteousness is settled in Christ we listen he who knew no sin became our sin that we might be made the righteousness of God in him so you're not just righteous as a Believer you are the righteousness of God am now tell me when the righteousness of God has ever failed tell me when the righteousness of God has ever been besed or depleted it can't it won't amen see if you're in Christ that's why it's settled it's a fixed position it's like the Northern Star all these other things might move around but this is fixed this is always in the same spot and your position in Christ does not change because you had a good day today or a bad day because you did the right thing or whatever it's fixed in Christ amen it's settled notice Hebrews we're in the same chapter verse 19 having therefore Brethren boldness to enter into the holiest by the blood of Jesus by a New and Living Way which he has consecrated for us who you do it for us through the veil that is to say his flesh having a high priest over the house of God let us draw near with a True Heart see it's no longer the double-minded Wishy Wash well it shouldn't be anyway the the the scoundrel I'm a sinner but I need help from God no that got settled amen we're talking about the guy that's in Christ let's draw near with a True Heart in full Assurance thank you in full Assurance of Faith having our hearts sprinkled from an evil conscience our bodies washed with pure water let us hold fast the profession of our faith without wavering in other words your confession your profession doesn't change based on the condition you hold fast notice why for you are Faith No for he is faithful why is it constant it's not because of your faithfulness because he yes is faithful that promised amen why are people filled with uncertainty and worry why why are the people so tossed out when they're supposed to hold fast without wavering amen see this is my point this why I lay all this out the intellectual mind it still is wrestling with the sin question and it will wrestle with it every day that you're life if you were hoping for an end to that good luck because the Bible does not spell it anywhere that one day your intellectual mind will resolve hey I'm sinless because listen all the evidence around you all the evidence in the mirror speaks to the contrary your five sses will never declare you righteous in the sight of God unless you're deluded I mean I know some people think they're that righteous they think they're God's Gift of the world Amen that's because they're deceived but the intellectual mind if you understand the scripture and you know what sin is in the Bible tells you what it is the intellectual mind will never look at the circumstances around you say hey I'm righteous there's no evidence to speak to it amen that's what Paul's talking about there's there's nothing there that lines up with it you're sent Es are still trying to decide am I righteous or am I unrighteous and it assimilates it assimilates new information all the time it's comparing itself to others comparing itself to all these things amen but the spiritual mind notice the carnal mind it's death but the spiritual mind is life and peace it's not just life it's life and peace other words that settles it amen the spiritual mind it's been purged of the conscience of sins it has no remembrance of these things things and that's why a Christian can't sin because the only sin is unbelief amen all the other things are just attributes of sin they're attributes of your unbelief but you believe now Believers have this really neat ability Believers believe they don't unbelieve you're not a drunk silver man or a black white dog you're a Believer Believers believe so no matter what mistakes you make no matter what happens in your life but I'm a Believer my profession I'm holding fast to it because he's faithful even when I'm not amen you can't commit sins you might make mistakes but you can't commit sins because you've ceased from your Works you're not doing anything anyway some of us never did but that's a whole another Point not not con not condoning laziness now but they no longer affect your righteous standing this is what I want you to catch this say Christianity was never meant to be hard it was meant to be impossible amen it was never meant to be hard it was just meant to be impossible you say what do you mean well Jesus own disciples he's going through these situations with the righteous he goes through marriage he's finally talks about marriage and divorce and you know if you divorce Remar this that goes through all this with the disciples and finally they just throw their hands up in you you ever been there well Lord if if this is the case who can be saved man if it's that tough nobody who can be saved that's the point that's the point yes yes now you get it well if this is the case man they thought Jesus was going to make it easy for him and he comes down he magnifies the law well man if you hate your brother without a cause you might as well murdered him you even look at a woman the wrong way you might as well commit adultery well well if that's the case who can be [Music] saved yeah with men this is impossible thank you that's that's what I'm looking for acknowledge that with you it's impossible there is zero possibility of your success it's not hard it's impossible with men it is impossible but With God all things are possible see we're not not alone if God is for us who can be against us see the the the what makes the difference is who's helping you out am man you've not just got a billionaire or a good consultant you've got the judge of all Heaven and Earth he doesn't just do things that are impossible he specializes in things that are impossible he literally does things that are impossible just to do them like was there really no other route from Egypt to the promised land we could go through this sea why would we go this way oh you're fixing to find out see I'm going to do this killing two birds with one stone thing not only am I going to make you a shortcut the enemy that has tormented you and kept you in bondage for 40 years I'm going to wipe him out in a day and you're never going to see him again you'll never deal with it again am God takes him pot we're like why would he do it that way because he's God and because he can you know it's like I was talking my wife about this a while back you know sometimes you pray about something Lord what should I do should I do this should I do that you know you're looking for direction sometimes God's like listen just be still just wait rest well why shouldn't I do something now maybe the solution to your situation doesn't exist yet yet praise the Lord maybe he's waiting to make one listen there was no route through the Red Sea but God made one at the right time he can make a way where there is no way you say well we go this way because it's the best way I don't even see a way that's the point we're not walking by sight right oh my my am so Christ makes it easy amen God takes the impossible and makes it easy listen only Christ can live the Christian life so the solution is to get Christ in your life if Christ is in your heart then it's easy this message it's not a burden to me I don't wake up and look at the Bible and say I got to pray again every day that's such a chore see our attitude shows what's what our hearts really looking at see men make it hard God didn't make it hard God made it impossible but then he made it easy men make it hard with their Creeds and their dogmas and their own ideas remember Peter he comes they have a counsil there uh I think it was in Antioch but they come after Peter preaches the house of Cornelius I it was Jerusalem but he comes and he begins to speak about this and and Peter makes this point why are we going to tempt God by putting a yoke upon the neck of these disciples which neither our fathers nor we are able to bear in other words why are we going to give the Gentiles a bunch of rules that we can't keep notice that's what the Pharisees that's what the Jews did we're going to put yolks on you and we carry on this heavy oh it's so heavy well that's not the Yoke Jesus gave they carrying somebody else's yoke amen oh it's so heavy I can't carry it picking up the wrong thing why would we now if we're not careful we can be that guy too well listen you need to live the way I want you to live man you don't have to do the thing I want amen but you do have to do what God wants amen listen if God wants it for you it's better for you listen now there's nothing in here that God compels you to do that's going to make your life wor it might seem worse it might seem rougher at first but I guarantee you like that Red Sea it's going to work out better if you just do what he said in the first place all things work together for good to them that love God to them who are they called according to his purpose amen didn't say it was always going to be easy amen didn't promise it ever be totally didn't promise you a life absent of struggles they promise it be for your good Amen brother B says this this is in 1956 the interiew Veil he says he says this is what I find about most Christians I hate to say it's true but it's true the most people that can profess Christianity they seem to have a such a hard time struggling to hold on I believe it's because of a lack of correct teaching of the Bible see it's your understanding is the issue it's not that it is hard you just think it's hard because you're taught it's hard not saying you but we teach ourselves that sometimes honestly we we're raised a certain way we look at a certain thing you know we get Catholic well I need to I need to bear this burden I need to suffer this to show God I'm Ser you know what if you want to show God you're serious about him believe his word it's believe his word that's simple you know you know how you tell your kids that you take them seriously you spend time with them yes you want I mean you want you want God to know that you man I I'm I'm taking this seriously spend time with him I believe it's because of a lack of correct teaching of the Bible there is no such thing as holding on see your premise is wrong I just can't hold on I know there's no such thing that's why it doesn't work he done the holding on yes got get a witness in here today it wasn't you it wasn't your fortitude and your spiritual might he held you when you had no strength to hold nothing you couldn't even hold your head up amen he didn't let you go he done the holding on thank you Jesus the whole Christian principle is based upon rest come unto me all ye that labor and are heavy laden I will give you rest don't have to worry and struggle you're just resting that's all given rest you enter into peace because the whole thing's finished them who he has called he is Justified those who he is Justified he's already glorified he says scripture quoting notice it's nothing that you could do amen or what you can do it's what God has done for you in Christ you could not come to somebody say well I I just quit this and I went to seeking God no man sought God right man don't seek it's not that he can't he just well I mean he can't also but he don't in other words it's never happened don't look through here don't look through the scripture don't look through the internet trying to find an example oh I found a guy that sought first no you didn't men don't seek God there's not one of us in here and I'll I'll raise my hand I was not looking for God I was running wanting nothing to do with him and if it was any other way it's your work it was your will I men don't see like sheep don't go after the shepherd the shepherd has to go after them first amen they're not tame from the get-go you have to teach him obedience and no man man don't seek God God seeks man the very beginning I love it the very beginning of the Garden of Eden proved it aam Adam ought Adam ought to have been running through the garden hollowing father father where are you but it was God was God going through the garden Adam Adam where are thou we make God do all the work then we want to take the credit here he is father or Adam Adam or Adam hiding that's the nature of man see that's where we're get in trouble I know the Bible says this but I'm gonna do my own thing I'm gon I'll just hide it hey Adam that's the if you got to hide it then you probably got some trouble going on Jesus said no man come to me except the father draws them for brother Ram says this again why are people so tossed about the Christian faith is based solidly upon rest that's right a Christian is not tossed about now this is the ideal I'm not saying this to condemn you if you feel tossed about amen I I hope you catch this this is what you're supposed to look like this is not a hey if you're not doing this I'm condemning you this is a hey you can have this amen this is for you if you will receive it a Christian is not tossed about a Christian doesn't run from place to C place a Christian doesn't fuss and fum and worry about things that's me what can be he says a Christian rests it's all over it's all finished for the believer at Calvary that's right sickness may come and disappointments but the Christian is at rest knowing this that God is a able to keep that which he has performed knowing that no matter what the thing is and how it looks there is neither sickness sorrow death neither starvation or anything that can separate us from the love of God that is in Jesus Christ amen see brother talks about the borderline Believers see that's the problem with the Border believer they they've got just enough religion to make them miserable they have just enough to make them miserable I know the Bible commands this and I to do it and I guess I'll do it see you're just at the borderline go labor to get into the rest get to this place where it's like ah listen Oh Glory to God Amen in a place where it's settled listen it's easy to be settled when we're sitting here at church temperatures the right temperature and we've got the fluffy seats and got carpet heyen well you walk out of here 10 minutes later and you get a phone call oh man my life's in shambles man rest it just a minute now amen just take it easy we take mole Hills and turn them into mountains then we wonder why do I struggle so much CU you made it that way I'm not saying that there's no one here today with real struggles I'm telling you whatever your struggle is whether it's large or small it's all the same to God if he can do impossible things he can do hard things he can do harder things it's all the same if you'll just trust God with it amen hope somebody gets this today listen God God doesn't just love you he likes you there's a thought he's interested in you he's interested in spending time listen he's more interested in us than most of us act in him we do things and if we get time help me Lord if we get time we'll get around to be an interested in him and he's literally done all these things and he's just waiting for our attention he's got nothing better going on today than to spend time with us think about this he can make anything he can do anything and this is number one on his list amen amen top priority hallelujah boy that ought to make you feel good about yourself amen listen if you look at your past and your history and your inability that will make you feel good but if you look at what God did for you ought don't make you feel 10 foot tall I don't have in front of me but Charles Spurgeon said something that's all right I'm qu quote Charles Spurgeon but it's perfect thanks brother got my endorsement I forget how he said exactly but he makes the point that when I look at myself and I look at Humanity It seems impossible to me that somebody could be saved but when I look at Christ and what he's done it seems impossible to me that everybody could be lost it's all what you're looking at I'm not saying that your sin and your struggles and your problems don't mean nothing what I'm saying is when you look at what God has done it's so much greater it's so much greater if you realize what it is when you look at God has done our day what he's declared through this message it's so much greater amen it eclipses it I interested in us behold the Bible says what manner of love the father has for us that means you can see it behold what manner of love the father has for us that we should be called the sons of God Amen listen it's his good pleasure to give us the kingdom Jesus endured the cross for the joy that was set before him many knows the story of of Boaz and Ruth in the Book of Ruth Ruth she comes she's you know her husband's dead no's like what are we going to do we need food she goes to the field of Boaz he's a near Kinsman and we all know that probably most of us know the story but Boaz decides to buy this field he knows if he buys his field he'll get a field but he doesn't buy the field because he wants the field he buys the field because he wants a wife amen God so loved the world he it's not because he needs mountains like I said at the beginning it's not because he needs an ocean it's not because he needs waterfront property he can make that he buys the field cuz he wants the treasure in the field he wants you and I he wants a wife he wants a a Ruth that's why Boaz buys the field that's why God redeems the Earth he can make another Earth but he wants the people in it he wants a bride amen so he goes down there to redeem this Ruth she's laid his feet and brother B I don't have time to unpack all this but you know goes through Ruth's four the four stages she she's there she decides she serves and then finally she rests and then she's rewarded it because brother bam talks about Boaz he says Boaz goes down what did he do he goes down to the gate he took the elders went before the gate took his shoe off let it be known today that I redeem Naomi and all of her inheritance he said he got the moabit which is Ruth with it when Jesus come what did he come to redeem Israel what did he do in taking Israel he got the Gentile bride see when he took Israel he went to his own he had to what was the first thing he had to do redeem his own and the Gentile church is just a a sister to that woman an Israelite Church certainly he had to redeem Israel to get to this and he had to redeem Naomi talking about Boaz to get to Ruth his bride now what did he do I love this he said before he could take her whooo he says Glory got a little religious he goes to the farm I guess he painted it all up he put new rugs on the floor he might have built a new house he got everything ready and he returned back with a corage for the wedding so he goes to the elders he does work he buys his stuff he fixes doing all this stuff what was Ruth doing not one thing seems a little unfair actually not one resting waiting no more toils no more frustration listen when people are tossed about and worried we look at politics we look at the world day people get all worried about it listen I'm I'm happy to stay in boaz's field I don't have to go look around from field to field I don't have to find some other Gleaners the Angels they left enough for me just just rest just take it easy I love the words of Naomi just rest he will not rest till he has finished the work till he is done I'm I you know it's like I said earlier don't make don't make prayer refuge for your unbel see see this is the problem God's our refuge so we we wait till trouble comes I better go to prayer maybe if you were there in the first place maybe if you were praying and rest trusted to God you wouldn't have to worry about it when it happens amen I love this brother I've preached this a while and then I heard a brother at our church brother Carrie pay talk about this I like how he said it you know in 1st Samuel 30 David he gets back uh and he gets raided he goes back from clag he goes there and the the Philistines that come they they took their wives they took their stuff at Camp they took all this stuff and everybody was discouraged every even David's trusted men they wanted to kill David they wanted to Stone him and the Bible says David encouraged himself in the Lord amen and then he goes and seeks God I love that he didn't go to God and say man what am I going to do I just uh I love this he encouraged himself first God's been faithful to me just like he did with Saul listen God helped me slay a bear he helped me slay a lion he helped me slay Giants I've killed 10,000 men by the help of God and he walks into prayer God you've been faithful amen God I know you've been with me you're a God that keeps his promises he didn't go in there oh God what am I going to do he goes in there with a True Heart in full Assurance drawn close go God you're the same God you said I'd be a king you said I'd rain one day and these enemies have come God I know you're with me God I'm not going to let this discouragement keep me down you've been faithful and God says go pursue take back what the enemy stole from you and he goes down there and he takes back his wives he takes back his stoil his spoil he takes what the enemy took from him and then he takes even more he comes out better off that he was before the trial come oh my amen don't just go and say well prayer is my refuge don't just make it your last line of defense make it the first place you go that's how you rest you get the presence of almighty God oh I'm struggling with this temptation I'm struggl with this bill then go pray about it first listen I'm I give a test all day where I struggle struggle struggle and you pray there was the answer so what you do you cultivate prayer Pray when you get up Pray when you lay down pray before you do anything pray without ceasing if we would just take the time Amen to go before almighty God give him well I've only got five minutes then give him five give them give them whatever you got give him your time watch him multiply it you've probably all heard hi Jana I don't know if I've told this testimony here before or not but my wife she was reminding me about it here the other day but my my daughter Jana when uh my wife was in the hospital they had uh they had induced her labor and the doctor I I don't I don't know if he gets DISD doctored or what this guy he went off and

the preview here the they were going to send the anesthesiologist in at some point and they sent me out of the room which they don't usually do this so I'm sitting in another room I don't know this all going on and finally a nurse visits me hey you can go back and see your wife and I'm getting back room just as they're Wheeling her out and they've got the code blue or whatever in the hospital call for an emergency C-section everybody's rushing there they're like that girl she'd already been without oxygen for 13 minutes and so I'm just sitting in the room I have no idea what's even going on at this point sit in the room where the bed was my wife was that the nurse comes in to give me the bad news brother Ruth well your daughter she went without oxygen for 13 minutes we have to do an emergency csection just you know they have brain damage after 15 minutes I'm like oh that's an interesting fact okay and she tells me two or three a couple more times listen she's probably going to have brain damage I finally looked at her brother John I said well listen uh I would have a reason to be worried if I weren't a Christian well that was really nice because she stopped talking to me about it she probably thought I was nuts amen my daughter's here today amen and and God has delivered her she's fine now and and listen listen if if something had happened to her I would have still loved her I would have still raised her but listen I didn't work worry about it I'm not like the other people she's talked to before I have a God that's bigger than the diagnosis I have a God that's bigger than the doctor's problems and the doctor's inability amen God can take the worst doctor in the world and make him a world run now whatever if he's in their hand for five minutes amen praise the Lord listen Moses I give you man we just ran into bad doctors's where I'm at I guess amen my wife when she was pregnant with Moses she was having trouble it was ended up being your gallbladder right I should have asked kidneys I should asked her all this ahead of time but I wasn't thinking about it amen But there again we go to the hospital and we we go and the guy the doctor work in the ER lets her know we you're getting ready to have a miscarriage you're just going to go home lose the baby just just go home you're going to lose the baby he just kept telling us that well just just prepare to lose the baby my wife's like I ain't having none of that I done prayed for this baby I prayed I was going to have a miscarriage I prayed for his blue eyes we're having a baby guess what he's there amen we let the first doctor's report we let the first criticism get us all hook up listen I'm not saying that to boast on me I'm telling you listen that's the time to be certain of God don't wait till Trouble Comes oh I need I need to get to God be in prayer be rested know the god you serve so when Trouble Comes and everybody's worried you're just resting you can testify like David a thousand might fall at my side and 10,000 at my right hand but it won't come near me only with my eyes shall I behold and see it amen see we wait too long we wait till trouble comes and then we wonder why we're not resting if we were resting the first place trouble wouldn't be trouble amen don't wait for the worst trial of your life to labor to get into that rest don't wait and make it your last Refuge I'm talking about living a life not just fixing the problem yes amen that's what we all do we come to church want want to fix our problem for this week we're trying to just fix problems all the time live an overcoming life don't live from trial to trial be changed from glory to glory walk in newness of life then even trials aren't the same anymore now they're testimonies listen if you want to build a testimony you're going to have to go through some trials it's just going to happen but you're going to go through them different than everybody else goes through them CU you've got somebody with you when the doctors give up up on you and family turns their back God is there God's faithful yes he is you begin to find confidence he's faithful that's why we don't waver he's never failed me yet amen it's never failed me yet people say you don't have what it takes you're not smart enough you're not good enough you're not talented enough doesn't matter God is he more than enough amen that's some point you got to stop struggling well I'll look for him when Trouble Comes seek the Lord today right why he may be while he may be found why would you wait you wait because you don't really believe it because if you really believe it that'd be the first thing you did listen if you believe in the power of prayer I don't have to make you pray you believe in the power of reading the word of God I don't have to make you listen I don't have to convince you that if I give you a million dollars it would change the way you live you just believe in the strength of the US dollar and it's not even that good you inflation might ruin Milli we might all be millionaires by the end year I don't know hopefully not God God forbid but amen you just have confidence in the strength of that money oh I would do this and you know how people are well I would do this and I would do that listen if you believe in the word of God if you believe in the power of prayer amen that's where you will spend your rest you will rest in that amen God bless you you stand to your feet today God help us to live overcoming lives every every time listen Abraham was told listen I will I will bless your Uprising right you get out of bed man I'm blessed listen not everybody's blessed when they get out of bed but I am amen you are amen I'll bless your upright I'll bless your down setting I'll bless

rest in that today let's pray father we thank you today I pray you'd take this thought and just move it into the hearts of the people in a greater way L Lord for each of us here today to to be a real settled to be a real faithful Christian may we not just be the person that looks at others and envies their Christian Life and testimony that looks at others and says what a what a stability they have Lord may be a reality I pray for each one of us today lord lord it's it's attainable it's possible because you made it possible to our human ability and our eyes it is impossible it is Out Of Reach to us but Lord you come down your Prophet said there was a a great CM between us we've seen it in Luke 16 between Abraham and the man that was in hell but Lord you not just bridged it but you moved it aside you've you've broken down the middle wall of partition between Jew and Gentile between the things that separated us you've given us access to the holy place we have access today through a high priest of our profession Jesus Christ we thank you Lord Jesus that we can pray and we have an advocacy we have an ear with God that our prayers they don't just go up into the air unheard but your reality and you answer prayer and you do things that are impossible for us Lord we praise and worship and thank you today not just for what you've done but because of who you are and what it means to us to behold and to see the love that you have for us that we should be called your children Lord I can look back in my life no doubt many of us can and see where we could have been see where we were going and to think that you not only spared us but you've invited us into your kingdom as children Lord my mind I I can't even grasp that Lord I I take it by Faith In My Heart Lord there's just it's so beyond beyond our own conceptions and our human thinking Lord I pray may not one of us take that for granted today it's so easy to gloss over it's so easy to overlook we're we're in an age of gross Darkness there's trouble on every hand it's it's so easy for us to forget but I pray for for us you'd stir up our Pure Minds by way of remembrance Lord may you may you Foster a greater stirring of faith in our lives and overcoming to be to be faithful because you've been faithful Lord we want to be faithful because you've been faithful we want to we want to act like your dear children I believe we are your children but Lord help us to act in a way to believe by faith and a way that would give glory to you that would Point others to Jesus Christ bless this church bless the Pastor I pray and
