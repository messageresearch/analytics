[Music] i'll bless you how beautiful if we could just receive the revelation of that song right there we could go home amen that's that's it if god could just take our lives and use them the way he wants to not when we want to then he well the brother by them said if he could just get one man in his hands he could turn the world upside down amen god bless you we certainly appreciate that so i'll listing it together for the reading of the word you can find uh that in saint john chapter 14. we're just going to read one verse of scripture amen i think we'll we'll read it and then we'll have a word of prayer saint john chapter 14 verse number 26 but the comforter which is the holy ghost whom the father will send in my name he will teach you all things and bring all things to your remembrance whatsoever i have said unto you amen let's look to them in prayer our dear heavenly father we all of us stand here absolutely helpless without you we need you lord to be able to even hear from you we need you to give us the ears to hear and lord we also need you this morning that you take these lips this tongue and this mind and these thoughts and lord that song we heard just give it back to you that you may speak your thoughts to us today lord that those thoughts would become real to us and that would they would become a part of our life so lord we ask that you take control lord of the service today that you'd bind up every disbelieving spirit every spirit that would try to keep us from the revelation that you would have for us we rebuke it in the name of jesus christ and we cast it forth lord may you take control lord of the atmosphere today lord may you bless every heart and every mind and lord bring us to the revelation that you would have for us today our dependency is upon you we also pray lord that you'd remember lord the individual needs that there would be in our midst lord lord whether it be some fighting depression some just uh being bothered by the things that are happening in the world lord perhaps bothered by the sicknesses and by this colvid and lord whatever would be a hindrance today we just ask that you'd raise up a standard in the name of jesus christ lord we thank you for your word for your word lord gives us power over these things and we lord we take charge today we love you today we thank you for your word we thank you for these songs lord we thank you lord for those that you have gathered together for those that are testifying today though none go with me still i will follow lord we just commit the furtherance of the service in your hands and ask that you would accomplish lord its very purpose now in jesus precious name we pray amen amen god bless you may be seated the last two services we had a little series on experiencing god's love and the first service was receiving god's love it was an awesome service we had the most compliments with that one the second service are releasing god's love well that was less popular that they didn't read have reached any popularity contest with that one um i may say things that you don't agree with and that's okay that's right brother branham said things that a lot of people didn't agree with paul had said things that it was even hard for the man who had the keys to the kingdom to understand brother branham said if he would be saying something and it didn't turn out right he says i want you to to to think about it in this way when you would go to eat chicken and you run into a bone you don't throw the whole meal away you just set the bone aside and you keep eating the chicken and i don't know many times i've taken out of my mouth some some some sliver of a bone or something and i never had a thought well i'm not going to eat anymore this meal now we might get a negative thought when we're in a restaurant that happens right but we won't do that at home or he said about having a cherry pie and you run into a pit he doesn't say well i'm disgusted with this pie you just put the pit aside so i'll say it like this when you you hear things that that don't agree with your real good just set that thing aside and keep eating don't stop eating sometimes it takes time for god to show us things the comforter which is the holy ghost whom the father will send in my name he will teach you all things and bring all things to your remembrance whatsoever i've said unto you now in order for the holy ghost to teach us something that means we haven't learned it yet amen so why would we come to church only agreeing with stuff that we already know it just doesn't make sense we wouldn't need a holy ghost then where do you know it so just because you don't agree with something doesn't mean it's not true the holy ghost teaches us it guides us it reminds us of things that we need to be reminded of paul said i stir up your minds by way of remembrance but what exactly is the holy ghost teaching us what is he guiding us and what is he reminding us of we want to speak on the comforter today and for a subject god's purpose for giving us the holy ghost else did jesus describe the comforter he described it as power in acts chapter 1 verse 8 he said but ye shall receive power after the holy ghost has come upon you and you shall be witnesses unto me both in jerusalem judea and sumerian unto the under most parts of the earth so this comforter not only teaches and guides us and reminds us but it's also a power to witness amen amen we're just going off of the words that jesus said but we want to dive into exactly what this is all about too often we have viewed the holy ghost comforter as being just something personal for us because we can't make a rapture without it and uh the spirit teaches us and guides us into all truth it helps us navigate and of all of our natural life issues how many listened to the tape last wednesday the first hour okay the tape was what was the holy ghost given for all the quotes that will be taken today is coming from the first hour of that message but i just wonder when we listen to a tape what we're really catching he said now last night he was referring to the night before last night we were speaking what it was what the holy ghost was and we found out in just about everything that god promised to us uh-huh in it we found that god it was for god's church it was what he what the church needed we found out it was the seal a comforter the rest the joy and the peace and the resurrection and all that god promised to his church now notice it was to the church not to my personal life right yes to the church lies within the holy spirit now i'm going to say some things that are going to stretch stretch what you think of the holy ghost but just be patient with me through it he says all my dear friends from around this country in this little city if i could get only with my human voice place into your heart the importance of receiving the baptism of the holy ghost it would be the most wonderful revelation that you've ever had in your life you to see he said to see you must do it amen so we have to our goal this morning is to try to get a better understanding of what the purpose of the holy ghost is and it takes a revelation i want to say today pray for revelation pray to receive not not to learn from my voice or my words but a revelation believe that you're here under the divine function of god that you've come here not on your own but the spirit inside of you led you here today for a purpose now the holy spirit is god the holy spirit is given to us to fulfill god's will in his church the holy ghost comforter is not for us it's not for our flesh right now we need it for a rapture and i've got some quotes again all these quotes are coming from there now we're going to show you after a while that there's those who are filled with the holy ghost goes into the rapture for the rest of the dead live not for a space of a thousand years that's right just holy spirit filled people was all that went into the rapture brother said in fact he says you're not converted until you receive the holy ghost he says you're believing on two so until that place you receive it you're believing unto the holy spirit has spoken to you and you've you publicly confessed him he says well the devil does the same thing i believe him to be the son of god so does the devil but you're walking on towards him now showing us the importance that the holy ghost is what this whole thing is about and yes the holy ghost will lead and guide us into all spiritual truth it will help us navigate through these life's issues and we benefit from having the holy ghost but the holy ghost isn't just for us now you've probably never heard a preacher say those words before that just happens to be how i am so why do we need the holy ghost well we need the holy ghost to make a rapture that's true because the bride will have the same spirit that the bridegroom has it'll have the same character that's why we need the holy ghost to make a rapture but it's not for us it's for christ we benefit from it but it's for christ christ loved and gave himself back right we already belonged to christ but he gave himself at calvary that he might buy back what already belonged to him amen he washes her with the word just like esther needed to be purified for the king ephesians 5 verse 27 that he might present unto who himself a glorious church not even spot or wrinkle or any such thing but that it should be holy and without blemish so he washes the church and gives her the holy ghost for himself jesus said i have many things to say unto you but you cannot bear it but after the holy ghost comes see after he comes inside the love of god is shed abroad in their heart by the holy ghost great peace have they that love my word and nothing shall offend them when the holy ghost is inside god can have his way with dealing with our flesh but until the holy ghost comes inside it's you can't hardly god can't hardly deal with certain things the holy ghost has power to bear truth remember love the love of god beareth all things but remember my love it only goes so far you you just you you push my button and you know what the hammer is going to come down but not god's love so when we bear god's love we can bear the truth amen come on be with me now don't be making excuses in ourselves we cannot bear the facts of dying out of forgiven 7 times 70 for laying down our lives for the brethren living for others the way that god's spirit does so is the holy spirit for us god does not want us in our carnal flesh in heaven god does not want to be married to carnality god wants to be married to character he wants to be married to someone who's just like him amen so is the holy ghost for us think about it we're so used to it's about us it's about me it's for me but is it really for us the holy spirit is not merely for our personal purpose but for god's eternal purpose think about the new birth first corinthians chapter 12 verse 13 says for by one spirit were all baptized into one body john chapter 1 verse 13 which were born not of blood nor the uh nor the will of the flesh nor of the will of man but of god right we were born of the will of god we were born for him not for us when we are born again we are born again to his will in other words we no longer are doing our will but it's his will that's important second corinthians chapter 5 verse 17 therefore if any man be in christ he is a new creature all things are passed away behold all things become new and all things are of god amen he's and he gives us a ministry of reconciliation so when we're born again a complete nature change by one holy spirit we're we're baptized into the body of christ for christ to do the will of christ brother branham said and what was the holy ghost given for he said what is it he said god working in you anywhere in the world that he he would want to call on you you're right there working in you to do his good will how we ought to thank god for that god the holy spirit is sent for the purpose of god living in this church moving through each age working out his divine will i wonder how many caught that when they were listening well that's just one isolated thing well that's why i got some more quotes for us today brother branham went on to say later and then he was made flesh and dwelt among us in order that he could come back again to man i'll tell you this this quote here is going to capture the whole message so please listen and then he was made flesh and dwelt among us in order that he could come back again to man and live in man and to restore a man to a state of communion with him again and to give him back his god-given right that he that's what he did he said that's the purpose of the holy ghost it's the father again god the father dwelling in you working out his plan to finish his plan of redemption working through you making you a co-worker with him giving you a place giving you a part for your fallen lost brother and sister giving you the holy spirit his love to go hunt the lost as he did in the garden of eden adam adam where art thou that's what the holy spirit does in a man or a woman when it strikes into their heart and takes a boat there's a thirst and a hungering for lost souls [Music] so tell me is the holy ghost for you that's what the matter with the meetings today there's not enough spirit touch in it to go for the souls of the lost in the dying it's more to make a name or a church or a building or a denomination and instead of a soul-winning program he said how pitiful we could stay on it much so i'm glad that's there because now i don't have to interpret how i'm supposed to feel when i get the holy ghost i don't have to interpret what the holy ghost for me does i know i gotta match that i've gotta match the book of acts many people visualize the comforter of the holy spirit as a comfort to help them with the affairs of this life is that true not realizing that isn't really what jesus was referring to and i want that to soak in jesus gave us the key when he told peter says after thou art converted strengthened thy brethren it was like a responsibility had nothing to do with him and all the problems he was going through the holy ghost was for the plan of redemption was helping out god's plan of redemption jesus had told his chosen disciples that he was going to be crucified what happened what happened their hearts began to get troubled he was leaving them they became full of sorrow and we might ask the question why would we would we visualize it would we imagine it the same way we would feel if we lost a loved one that our hearts was sorrowful and and and and and troubled at the situation remember they came to understand that the disciples they were not of this world and the only connection they had to the world that they were originally from was leaving them jesus was the one that told them said you're not of this world i'm not in this world you're not of this world we're from a different place he that fights with the sword dies with the sword so he made it clear and now the only connection to the world that they were going to was leaving them i think it was a a much greater connection there with that than anything he was the only one that had the words of eternal life and they were these words were leaving the comforter wasn't just for their troubles and fears he had already told them let not your heart be troubled he said in john chapter 14 27 he said peace i leave with you my peace i give unto you not as the world giveth give i unto you let not your heart be troubled neither let it be afraid so he had already given them peace he already told not your heart be troubled they didn't follow jesus for peace they didn't drop their nets for an easier life they didn't leave their professions for better money they left because jesus had the words of eternal life and they were called to fish out men out of this world so they could share the words of eternal life with them and now this eternal life was leaving them when jesus began to preach about harder things that believers needed to do the things that accompany salvation the things that strong meat belongs to them that are full age the bible says about receiving all of jesus that's a harder thing into their personal lives but they seemed like bones in the chicken or pits in the pie and they decided that they couldn't take that much of jesus in john chapter 6 verse 66 as we know brother john lafontaine said they took the mark of the beast it recalls from that time many of his disciples went back and walked no more with him now why is it that some people they'll come to jesus they'll get baptized they'll go so far and then they just stop they withdraw from continuing to walk forward they don't realize they're taking the mark of the beast we just sung it brother brother ron son the song if we don't walk in the light we're not going to go in the rapture we're going to miss it then said jesus unto the twelve will you also go away simon peter answered lord to whom shall we go for thou has the words of eternal life and we believe and are sure that thou art the christ the son of the living god now jesus was leaving them the words of eternal life was leaving them and i just want you to imagine this for a moment how would you feel if the only connection to eternal life was leaving you you just oh i'm gonna hop into another message church brother john think about it they didn't have another message church to go to john chapter 14 verse 5 thomas sayeth unto him lord we know not whether thou goest and how can we know the way and jesus saith unto him i am the way the truth the life and no man cometh to the father but by me and now the me was leaving them so how are they going to get connected how are they going to make it how are they going to get others that they were supposed to fish out of the world get them there yes the disciples were bothered about the fact and jesus told them that they're going to mock you and afflict you and crucify you and kick you out of the church they're even going to kill you thinking they're doing me a service and i'm sure those things bothered them but the disciples were also concerned about not knowing how they were going to make it without jesus being there because jesus had the words of eternal life these disciples did not have an overconfident attitude that they had enough i'm offered jesus enough or they knew it all or had enough experience with jesus no sir they were concerned and they realized they still needed jesus jesus dealing with their concern in in his own way he said in saint john chapter 16 verse number 6 because i i said these things unto you sorrow has filled your heart nevertheless i tell you the truth is expedient if i go not away for if i go another way the comforter will not come out to you but if i depart i will send him unto you we need the holy ghost amen the holy ghost is just peace in the middle of a storm now since the day of pentecost what has the devil been trying to do since the day of pentecost he's doing everything he can to keep people from the holy ghost i can just imagine i can just see these devils and how having meetings trying to come up with ways to keep people from getting the holy ghost trying to form ways to achieve their objectives let's put the thoughts into the people's minds that it was only for the first 12 disciples or it was just for the early church or how about this one it really doesn't exist see all these things will make somebody not seek after the holy ghost how about this one this is a big one they already have it let's put in their minds that they already have it because if you already have it why do i need to go look for my car keys if i already got them let's tell them that as soon as they speak in tongues they got it or they get baptized or they accept the message or that they believe he says we'll confuse them and get them so busy in the world that they won't even make time and if that don't work as as a as a final we'll relax them and give them so many pleasures that getting the holy ghost won't even enter in their minds why is it so hard for us to come into church and hunger for the holy ghost you don't got to be very spiritual to know what's going on the importance of getting the whole holy ghost is cannot be overemphasized brother branham said is the most wonderful revelation that you can ever have in your life we read that now if you don't have the holy ghost or you want more we got good news today doing what god tells you to do will give you the holy ghost acts chapter 5 verse 20 32 acts chapter 5 verse 32 and we are his witnesses of these things and so is the holy ghost whom god have given to them that obey him so if you know god wants you to do something just do it just do it it doesn't matter how simple it is doesn't matter if it doesn't have anything to do with whatever you think is spiritual if god wants you to do something just do it because it opens the door for the holy ghost john chapter 14 verse 15 john chapter 14 verse 15 if you love me keep my commandments and i will pray the father and he shall give you another comforter isn't that something just kind of connected right there that he may abide with you forever even the spirit of truth whom the world cannot receive because it seeth him not neither knoweth him but ye know him how do you know him for he dwelt with you and shall be in you i will not leave you comfortless i will come to you the comforter is the spirit of truth john chapter 14 verse 26 the comforter which is the holy ghost whom the father will send in my name he will teach you all things and bring all things to your remembrance whatsoever i have said unto you jesus explains in a very simple way to help us understand the workings of the holy spirit inside of a human being and how it happens and it's it's hid i believe in john chapter 14 verse 26 john chapter 14 uh verse 20 i mean john chapter 14 verse 20 at that day ye shall know that i am in the father and you and me and i and you now that can be you know a little complex because we're used to saying either the water's in this bottle where it's not right he that hath my commandments now notice and keepeth them he it is that love with me and he that loveth me shall be loved of my father and i will love him and will manifest myself to him so if you want revelation be real serious about keeping god's commandments if you want to pick and choose you want to have a smorgasbord every time you come to church you're going to take what you want you don't realize that you are identifying the relationship that you have with god now judas saith unto him not iscariot lord how is it that thou will manifest thyself to us and not to others not to others because they were staring at jesus as one man and now it's going to be an invisible thing right can god cometh without observation jesus answered and said on him if a man loved me if a man loved me there's the there's the crutch right there he will keep my words and my father will love him and we will come unto him and make our bold with him now that's the comforter coming inside of a human being it can't get any more simpler than that because you know when we stare at acts chapter 2 38 repent be baptized every one of you in the name of the lord jesus christ remission and you shall receive the gift of the holy ghost it doesn't say anything about obeying it doesn't say anything about keeping the commandments but that's what it really means to believe what it really means to what it means to turn around that's why we got to search the scriptures amen right it's so simple that it goes over the heads of the majority but god is hidden in simplicity in this modern day they would write a book and say how to receive the holy ghost for dummies we just need to get more serious about the word brother branham talked in that that message that we listened to about getting into prayer he talked about those that had the holy ghost ought to be concerned about for those that didn't and to pray with those that didn't well he didn't say just the it's true pastors that claim they got the holy ghost ought to be interested in those that don't have it and to get with them and pray that's that's old-fashioned that's old-fashioned but people need to be taught how to get the holy ghost john chapter 15 gives us a a visual of what it means to abide in christ he said i'm the vine you are the branches and jesus gives us a responsibility in that chapter to do our part by keeping abiding in him we have to be willing to continue to abide in other words our will can separate the abiding our desire to do what we want to do instead of what god wants to do can stop the abiding now once the abiding stops the joy stops because you know i'm going to tell you me our flesh our joy only goes so far if i was an entertainer or a comedian if i was tim hawkins if i could entertain for you and make you laugh enjoy it would last such a short time as soon as it was over and your thoughts were done you started with life well we'd start to get unhappy and long faces and but the joy of the lord it abides as long as you're abiding in the word in the last word he gave you r amen amen later in the chapter 15 verse number 26 but when the comforter is come whom i will send to my fathers sent unto you from the father even the spirit of truth which proceedeth from the father he shall testify in me and ye shall bear and ye also shall bear wetness he and ye shall also bear witness because he had been with me from the beginning i think that's why it's important for us to know the nature of god amen chapter 16 verse 7 a worse there's a lot of scripture i know but i just want you to catch the point you can go back and study any time saint john chapter 16 verse 7 nevertheless i tell you the truth is exceeding it for you that i go away if i go no way the comforter will not come but if i depart i will send them unto you and when he's come he will reprove the world of sin the righteousness of judgment of sin because they believe not on me of righteous because i go to the father you should see me no more of judgment because the prince of the world is judged i have yet many things to say to you but you cannot bear it now albeit when this fair truth has come he will guide you into all truth he shall speak of not of himself but whatsoever he shall hear that shall he speak and he will show you things to come so the work of the comforter or the holy ghost is to reprove us it's not the job is not to reprove the world but the world inside of us we don't need to get out there and find a newspaper that we can tell the world how bad it is but god sees things in us that are bad it's called the world and the job of the comforter is to reprove those worldly things inside of us the way we think about our lives how we're supposed to live our lives the comforter leads and guides us into transforming our minds into the mind of christ to think the way that christ thought paul said let this mind be in you which was also in christ jesus just think about this he made himself of no reputation and he took upon him the form of a servant now this is the working of the holy ghost philippians chapter 2 verse number 2 he said fulfill ye my joy that you be like-minded having the same love being of one accord of one of mine let nothing be done through strife or vainglory but in loneliness of mine let each esteem the other better than themselves so it takes a lot for a person to actually want somebody else to be blessed more than yourself it's a different spirit let not every uh okay look not every man on his own things hey look on my stuff no but every man also on the things of others let this mind be in you which was also in christ jesus now this is such a very this is what the holy ghost is god the holy ghost in you is the mind of god in you it's this is not something that we you know we try to do on ourselves to become more interested in others this is what happens when we do let go and let god have his way this is the way that he will have he will not have a different way it will be this way the word way now the comfort of the holy spirit leads us into all truth the bible says that jesus christ is the truth so let the mind of truth be in you the mind of christ will always lead us into more truth and will always be using us to lead others into more truth because that's who christ is well brother john that ain't going to leave much time for my life use me lord lord don't use me that much think about it think about it some of us we'd have to have a big meteorite come down in our yard to say oh lord you're trying to speak to me the word is already calling us if you ever want to know what happens to a person who gets filled with the holy ghost read the book of acts the book of acts describes or narrates how the holy ghost acts acts in a human being so if you ever want to know how the holy spirit works leads guides or keeps us read the book of acts now the minds of the disciples drastically changed in the book of acts from the four gospels to the book of acts their minds drastically changed from being a selfish coward into a selfless and bold way of laying down their life for jesus christ [Applause] the holy ghost transformed them into another way of thinking they began thinking like jesus did jesus laid down his life they began to lay down their life they began to unite with carrying out the the plan of redemption the purpose of why god gave them the holy ghost shortly after the disciples had received the holy ghost in the upper room the comforter led them to preach the gospel and many signs and wonders began to be performed just pick up with me in acts chapter 5 verse 14 and believers were the more added to the lord multitudes of both men and women in so much that they brought forth the sick and into the streets and laid them on beds and couches that at the least the shallow peter passing by might overshadow some of them they came there came also multitudes of the city round about unto jerusalem bringing sick folks and them that were vexed and unclean spirits and they healed everyone and the high priest rose up and all they that were with him which is of the sect of the sad you see and were filled with indignation and they laid their hands on the apostles and put them into the common prisons now that's a very sad situation now some modern 21st century new age believers would have questioned such persecutions happening to them perhaps they would have thought maybe we overdid it maybe we were over zealous maybe we were just you know pushing the gospel too much maybe we should have been a little bit more secretive about our beliefs maybe jesus really didn't want us to put uh a light uh out on the table maybe he really wanted us maybe we misunderstood maybe he thought maybe he wanted us to put our light under a bushel because his persecutions coming maybe jesus didn't understand what he was saying maybe jesus really didn't want them to preach it from the house stop maybe he meant to say basement maybe the comforter was trying to lead us to be more careful about who we talked to about jesus we know how peter responded when before he got the holy ghost he was so sheepish and coward denying that he was a christian in front of others verse 19 but the angel of the lord by night opened the prison doors and brought them forth and said go run for your lives you're free go go go no no he said go stand and speak in the temple to the people all the words of this eternal life so what's the holy ghost for the comforter was to hold them while they went through all the things that the spirit was leading them to do it has power to keep you the comforter held them while they further carried out the ministry of jesus or this great plan of jehovah's redemption amen one time they asked brother branham when he lost his daughter and his wife he says did you keep your religion he said no it kept me the purpose of the holy ghost is to keep you it doesn't keep you away from problems and trials and making mistakes brother branham made them you made them i made them we'll probably be making until we're out of here but the holy ghost will keep you the comforter will keep you whatever he wants you to do and wherever he leads you to do if he will keep you one day the comforter was guiding paul and silas into truth of doing god's will in acts chapter 16 and while the spirit led them to pray a person with a religious spirit began to follow them saying these men are the servants of the most high god and show unto us the way of salvation now you might have thought this free advertisement would have been good for his campaign but after many days it grieved paul see there's some i think if they would have did it one time but it just kept on doing it paul knew something was wrong he was grieved in his spirit and he turned and said to the spirit i command thee in the name of jesus christ to come out of her and he came out the same hour now because of casting out religious demons the persecution started they were falsely accused they were threatened because of it they were beaten with many stripes they were cast into the inner prison you can read it in acts chapter 16 they were chained to the floor and they were watched closely by a jailer do you think they were second guessing the leadership of the comforter think about what they went through sometimes we have a little something happen all sudden we just get all scared bend out of shape do you think they were questioning the spirit guiding them into all truth of this situation do you think they were whining and crying about what was seen to be so unfair i was just trying to tell them the truth and now look that's really good no sir the comforter will not lead you will it will not keep you so if i ain't keeping you think about what's guiding you in the middle of the night they agreed together in prayer and you know what they began to praise god that's what the comforter is for to be able to stand the persecution while god uses you to save a jail a jailer amen you know god could have led that jailer to come to one of paul's bible studies but that ain't what he did he sent paul to prison to save them amen and as he was working out the redemption of god's great plan for this paul needed the holy ghost to know to stand all the junk that he had to go through because it ain't normal for a human being to start praising god for being whipped and chained and thrown into prison you know someone don't shake our hand we get offended and start huffing and puffing and thinking about it and you know what is that why they do that what is going on what spirit is inside of us it ain't us building a church god is building the church and we need to be about the father's business the holy ghost was leading and guiding paul but he never knew what was going to happen i'll get to it just like moses i don't the bible doesn't say moses knew that the female servants were going to do the same thing that he did look about abraham abraham went out not knowing where he was going but he was blood of god look at aaron and elizabeth perfect example leading but not knowing what's going to happen god led brother johnson to ann arbor and he didn't even know where it was on the pla on the map brother branham was led to pray for a lost boy whose mother had prayed all night for and he didn't know what was going on remember when they had that trap set the chicago minister association had a trap set for him and as soon as brother random found out his first reaction he told the holy ghost he says okay i won't go then and the holy ghost said no you will go see the holy ghost don't keep you from a problem it keeps you through the problem god wanted brother ram to be a witness in the face of all those demons who did not believe the full gospel they only believed part of it he stood there not in the offense of the gospel but he's still there in the defense of the gospel and he's he knew everybody was sitting i love what tommy hicks said he said you may not disagree you may not agree with this man but i tell you he's fearless in what he believes that's what the holy ghost he says look i'm not you know come i want somebody to come up here with their bible prove me wrong don't bring your your own thoughts your own ideas about the message bring the bible no one would come all right bring your committee bring your ban your your board come up here as a group maybe you're too afraid he said not a one move what is the holy ghost for the holy ghost isn't for us personally it's for god to fulfill his purpose because it is god in you it's not a christmas gift for you to do what you want to do with it i'll never forget driving down the road when the holy spirit said you're gonna have a business there to this day i walk into the shop and i don't feel i own a piece of it but you know i feel like i feel like i got a weight of responsibility to keep things in order to make sure god is first i don't feel he gave it to me from me i didn't understand a burden that was on my heart to minister when i could not stand the thought of standing in front of people and anybody that ever knew me before being a minister would agree that man will never preach it's the truth a lot of times you see when i'm singing i don't even look at you i'm just not interested in being up here i so bad i want you to have the word that's so bad i want you to have a relationship with jesus that means so much to me so what i did to battle that fear put on my computer and some of you know this your love to help people needs to be greater than your fear of failing [Music] that's what the holy ghost is for god is always leading his people to fulfill his purpose they are they that are sons of god are led by the spirit of god god works out all things after the counsel of his will to fulfill his eternal purpose so the purpose of the holy ghost is to fulfill god's will and his eternal purpose not your temporary will that you want right now why this message is not going to be real flowery to the flesh but we need to know why god has given us the holy ghost so paul goes bound in the spirit unto jerusalem not knowing the things that shall befall him there and in acts chapter 20 verse 23 save the holy spirit witness in every city saying bonds and afflictions abide me he said but none of these things move me neither count i my life dear unto myself just thinking about the song that sister elizabeth saying you know if you're going to give your life to jesus you don't count your life dear to yourself but if you don't give your life to jesus you're holding back that means you count your life dear he says that i might finish my course with joy and the ministry remember he gives us a ministry after receiving the holy ghost which i have received to the lord jesus to testify the gospel of the grace of god the comforter was leading and guiding paul into the truth of what god wanted him to do not just the doctrine the truth and what to carry out in his life and the comforter was there with joy and peace as he went through his afflictions doing it see this this whole concept of this the holy ghost is for me and just all about me no it's not all about you acts chapter 21 verse 10 and as we tarried there many days there came from judah a certain prophet named agabus and when he was come unto us he took paul's girdle and bound it in his own hands and feet and said thus sayeth the holy ghost notice who's speaking here it's it's it wasn't egg of us it was god so shall the jews at jerusalem bind the man that owned this girdle and shall deliver him to the hands of the gentiles now why would god say that you know that's our god god is going to put us through things not because he wants us to suffer because we have to go through those things to save somebody to be a witness at jerusalem or somewhere in our life and when we heard these things both we in the and they that of that place besought him not to go up to jerusalem see now that's the natural thing if you know you're going to suffer don't do it but if you're filled with the holy ghost this is how paul answered what meaneth ye to weep you know you're breaking my heart acting like this for i am ready not to be bound only but also to die if i have to jerusalem for the name of the lord jesus you you now that was a real a real manifestation to me that his life was not dear unto him if he was willing to give his life and when we would and when he would not be persuaded we just quit and we said the will of the lord be taught think about that the will of the lord the will of the holy ghost it was not for paul's comfort it's so paul could carry out the will of god hey paul could have went and just built tents made a decent living stayed away from the persecution kind of live his own life maybe go to peter's church let him be the pastor they asked him to be a deacon he'd say no i don't really want to be well can you at least take no i don't want to take up the offering would you at least clean the church paul no i just has too much responsibility yes yes yes i will preach i will preach till there's nobody to preach to because satan wants to get in and have this whole thing about just us and god that's right we all look at the comforters being there to comfort us in our personalized our personal situations i want you to imagine for a moment peter was filled with the holy ghost when they came and they took jesus away to be crucified would we imagine peter's being comforted oh it's okay is that the purpose of the holy ghost how about after peter denies jesus let's imagine that he's got the holy ghost would we imagine the holy ghost comforting him saying well it's going to be all right no we want wouldn't how about when they they came to get jesus and he was filled with the holy ghost and jesus just let him take the sword draw the sword out and start you know killing everybody physically i don't think jesus or peter would have went away being scared because he was so physically psyched up just the wrong spirit because see peter was not called to the offense of the gospel but to the defense of the gospel he was called to be a servant a lamb to lay down his life for his brother not prove who's right so what is the reason god sent the holy ghost the spirit of truth the comforter the reasons that jesus gave us was to reprove the world out of our lives to lead us into righteousness to guide us into all truth to give us power to become a proper witness so we don't get offended they don't whine and complain because of a fiction afflictions or things are too hard or somebody did us wrong or or began to persecute us or or drew us out of their circle the holy ghost just draws a bigger circle i'm so sick of drawing circles i am too but you know what god gotti he endureth and about he endures all things he bears all things he just keeps going his love for you has not diminished since the day you gave your life to jesus christ but why do we have thoughts about how far we're going to go with somebody because it's you and it's not god in you speaking but you don't realize it holy ghost is not about you afflictions and persecutions will always follow a believer who takes a stand to reach out for souls paul told timothy straight up in second timothy chapter 1 verse 7 for god have not given us a spirit of fear but power and love and a sound mind and so look he's in prison now and he's inviting timothy be not thou therefore ashamed of the testimony of our lord what testimony is that that you're going to suffer that you're going to suffer if you really get filled with god nor of me is prisoner but be thou a partaker of the gospel amen a partaker of the gospel according to the power of god according to the power of the holy spirit you shall receive power after the holy ghost has come upon you and you shall be witnesses unto me that's what the holy ghost is for and paul tells timothy about the perilous times that are coming basically in the day that we're living in that church-going people would be lovers of their own self lovers of pleasure more than lovers of god while maintaining some sort of form of godliness come on now we should not be stopping saying amen let's say amen to the word amen yet they have no power they have no spiritual strength for what to deny their flesh to lay down their lives no they don't have to they covet things they're proud they're boastful they're unthankful people heady high-minded fierce false accusers of others they're simply in love with themselves instead of in love with the souls of others paul said you better you better turn away from that kind of spirit paul identifies these people as men of corrupt minds ever learning and never able to come to the knowledge of the truth in other words they resist the truth the truth that they should be denying their flesh and laying down their lives for another soul in other words they're going to have they're going to serve god on this side of jordan they're going to go to have their own little denomination paul did not want timothy to be persuaded of taking an easier path and still call it christianity he said but be thou a partaker of the afflictions and the gospel according to the power of god we need the holy ghost that's the answer when we're staring at oh i gotta partake of afflictions oh that's not exciting i'm not interested in that i want a different gospel what we need is the gospel of the holy ghost so we can do that the spirit of this world inside the church is against the revealed truth of the hour i want you to think about that the spirit of this world that's inside the church is against the revealed truth of the hour now your intent of loving god loving the word becoming the word is just as real as real can be but remember the spirit of this world is against the spirit of the revealed truth of this message that's trying to meet the bride you believe that it is so no understand when things are happening inside of here and you're not liking or agreeing what's being said you need to recognize that ain't the holy brother branham said for when god made himself known to christ they hated him who hated him the worst the church the church hated him the worst they hated him worse than a the drunkard you know some people get along with drunks better why the drunk isn't going to give you any conviction is that going to give you a hard time they hated him worse than all the other people it was the church that hated him so anytime you feel a hate towards what's being spoken i don't take it personally because it's the spirit of the world that's inside of you that's hating the revealed truth that's coming out of this vessel it's not a popularity concert a concert contest they both start with a c second timothy chapter 3 verse 10 but thou has fully known my doctrine my manner of life my purpose my faith my long suffering my charity my patience persecutions and afflictions which came up to me in antioch iconium lystra what persecutions i endured but out of them all the lord delivered me there's the difference you know god's going to take care of you yeah and all that live godly in christ jesus shall suffer persecution but evil men and seduce yourself worse worse shall wax worse and worse deceiving and being deceived but continue down the things which thou has learned and has been assured of knowing of who thou has learned them stay with the bible stay with the message of the hour so what is the holy ghost for colossians chapter 1 verse 16 for by him were all things created that are in heaven that are on earth visible and invisible whether they be thrones dominions principalities or powers all things were created by him and the most important for him so we were created for god god gives you the holy ghost for him and he is before all things and by him all things consist and he is the head of the body the church who is the beginning the firstborn of the dead that in all things that in the church that in your church in this church that in all things he might have the preeminence without the holy ghost you won't give god the time of day you're going to do your own thing with the holy ghost god's got control he takes preeminence in your life brother i'm saying them in that message with the holy ghost for christ poured himself into the church therefore now watch at that day quoting jesus you will know that i am in the father and you are in me and i in you at that day you'll know it for it's the whole thing in the in one plan of redemption coming down at that day you're gonna know i'm in you it's about the whole plan of redemption you know in our flesh we can sing i've been redeemed and we feel good about it but where's the burden for the person who hasn't been redeemed who hasn't come to this relationship where they've given everything to jesus where is that well that's not my responsibility show me that spirit show me that holy ghost spirit in the bible show me that holy ghost spirit in the message i can't find that but i could be wrong i don't think i am i'm giving you time come on up here bring your bible okay bring your panel for it is the whole thing in one plan of redemption coming down that god coming back to live in and to dwell with and to commune with his people as he did in the beginning now god as that light was begin to shine in the last days he is expecting us hope this doesn't get to you he's expecting us a great thing from us because where there's much given there is much required so he's going to require much of us than he did from the lutherans or the methodists because we walk in a greater light with a greater power with a greater witness than they had i want you to notice all these quotes came from the 60 minutes of that message that you listened to but it's all coming forth of the holy spirit till the great church is being filled up and chugged full hallelujah brother brown next on the pulpit twice of the great powers of the almighty god until it's got to a place until the very works of jesus done is manifesting itself right in the church now amen now so i read that i ought to come to church excited with an expectation not coming to church because it's a church i want to go if i don't go right i'll feel bad there would be a spirit inside of us i can't wait till those doors are open if that ain't there you need to look at the spirit you're feeding on now listen he said he deals with the church as individuals each individual in the church and that's why i say this you know everybody in this church is not going to agree with me they're not going to agree what's being what this message teach what this bible teaches but don't let you be that one be the one that says i'm going to get closer i'm going to take this word today and i'm going to let god have control of my life i'm going to seek more of the holy ghost so he can have his way in my life instead of just being satisfied while i got enough to make it you know that spirit if god had that spirit he would have never went to calvary and you're going to tell me that's the same spirit in you no sir he said now the words that i do shall you do also he said not another work but god wants to bring the holy ghost in you to continue the same work that he was doing in christ that's what the prophet said the same purpose in other words the same plan so why do you got the holy ghost what's the purpose of the holy ghost the brain said as jesus said as the father has sent me as now watch as the father has sent me so send i you as the father how did the father send him the father that sent him come down from heaven and dwelt in him so how does he send you the holy ghost comes down and sends you he went forth he said i always do the things that please my father he went about doing the things that his father was showing him to do i do not think that the father showed me first the god that sent him was on the inside of him as the father sent me the same way the father set me so i send you what is it god in you carrying on the same works the same way amen i tell you we we know we know this to be the truth but is it happening in our life that's the question is it happening in our life because if it's not this is where decisions have to be made so what is the holy ghost for let's stand together i just want to close in this statement the holy ghost isn't just for our personal purposes isn't just to comfort us with our personal life issues the purpose of the holy ghost today is so god can live in you and use you to carry out his original plan of redemption and did you know the bible says that all things work together for the good amen to them that love the lord and to them that are called according to what his purpose impart the holy ghost is for god's purpose to fulfill his plan of redemption not the zillion things that we got going on in our life i'm not saying god ain't interested in those i'm not saying god won't help with those things but that ain't its main objective to me those are just like the french benefits really you you you pay your ties not just so your barns are full that just happens you don't you don't get the only ghost since you can have joy it just comes from getting the holy ghost you still got to carry out the plan of redemption don't sell yourself short of the realness of what god has for each of you wherever you're at personally with the lord i want you to extend that imagine it like an extension ladder you're just reaching up a little closer to god seeing more clearly your purpose of why god gave you his spirit so you can be a fisher of men that's fulfilling his purpose that's why brother brahm could say that that missionary work was always in the will of god it was always his purpose amen it is a privilege so again we're fighting this the spirit that would try to keep us from allowing god to use our life it's don't be selfish with the holy ghost live for others amen let's bow our heart in in prayer maybe there'd be someone here today say brother john this word has spoken to me in a way that i've never quite seen it like this and i'm just asking would you remember me in prayer god bless these hands that sees your heart so beautiful so beautiful tell me my heart just rejoices off i can say it like this the holy ghost inside of me is rejoicing seizure your love for the holy spirit to have his way amen heavenly father lord my hands are lifted too lord has spent over a week pondering these things that you gave me that you gave us this little flock here lord we're unworthy of your word to come forth in a way to get our attention and to show us it's really all about you lord we think about that one song that was sung can't think of the maybe michael w smith i'm not sure but talking about worship that song he said sorry lord for what i made it it's all about you it's all about you lord we're sorry for making the holy spirit about us it's all about you bless these hands and these hearts these desires lord i pray that you would shine forth through each life as your as the book of acts in this age in the midst of darkness let them be the light shining out let people see that you are the same yesterday today and forever caring about other people's souls interested in laying down their lives just to see one come to know you keep us o god keep us with the mind of christ let us not slip in our own carnality but keep us as we go forth from here esteeming others better than ourselves help us to fulfill your joy to be like-minded with you lord we love you we thank you for these things now we humbly ask it in jesus christ precious name amen amen praise the lord let's sing that what you were playing there the comforters come amen oh spread the tidings round wherever man is found wherever human woes and human woes abound let every christian tongue proclaim the joyful sound the come further has come [Applause] the comforter has come the car further has come the holy ghost from heaven the father's promise given oh spread the tidings round wherever man is
